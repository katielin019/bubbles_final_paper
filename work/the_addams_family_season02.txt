{START OF EPISODE 01}
Wonderful, darling.
Such precision.
It's not easy.
Terrific.
I wish that doctor could see him now.
Doctor?
You know, the one that said our family was unbalanced.
Gomez has got plenty of balance.
Just takes practice.
As soon as I get a little more practice, then I'll unhook it.
Well, Lurch, you may take it down now.
I hope you have it perfected by Wednesday's birthday.
We have plenty of surprises for Wednesday.
For one thing, we're going to put on a play.
A new drama by that great new dramatist, Tennessee Addams.
And we're all going to be in it.
Come with me to the casbah.
Heathcliff, where are you?
Lady Chatterley, I love you.
By george, this house is a veritable cesspool of talent.
Wednesday will be so thrilled.
- Gomez, what's the play about?
- Well, it's a most unusual plot.
There's this young couple, Claude and Mabel.
And they're in love.
But their families are feuding and they refuse to let the young lovers get married.
How delightfully tragic.
Thank you, my dear.
Well, there's no use telling you the rest.
We'll have a play read.
Places, please.
Lurch, a little mood music.
"And then he takes poison, "and then she takes poison.
"And they both die happily ever after".
Oh, what a lovely finish, Gomez.
Real togetherness.
Quite a twist, eh?
Well, now for the casting.
Morticia, of course, will play the girl.
Mama will play her mother.
Fester Of course we want you in it, Cousin Itt.
What would the play be without you?
I just want to find the right part for you.
Hey, Gomez, if you put this to music, he could play a Beatle.
In fact, all four of them.
- You need any singers?
- No.
No, there's no part for a sheepdog, either.
Don't say that, Cousin Itt.
You are not useless and good for nothing.
You most certainly are good for something.
We just don't know what it is.
Gomez, darling, Cousin Itt's inferiority complex is getting worse all the time.
I have it.
Cousin Itt, you are going to be the star of our new play.
The hero, Claude.
I think I'm allergic to you.
Here.
You do?
Isn't that amazing?
He knows the part after only hearing it read once.
Now, let's see.
We'll start with the love scene at the top of Act Two.
Claude, the hero, is looking up at Mabel's balcony, and says Marvelous.
What feeling, what emotion.
Such passion, such depth of feeling.
Querida, play the scene with him.
At the top of the balcony, go on.
There, Act Two.
Oh, thank you.
"We must flee, my love.
"If my father catches you here, "he will shoot you, kill you, and break your glasses".
Wait a minute.
You changed one of my lines.
That's different.
Are you sure this part doesn't call for a taller man?
Someone like me.
No, Cousin Itt is perfection.
But Uncle Fester, you could be the understudy.
You mean, if something happens to him, like if he gets clobbered, I could play Claude?
Of course.
Itt.
Let's go down to the playroom.
We can rehearse together.
Lurch, you can be the second understudy.
That means if Cousin Itt can't make it, and something happens to Uncle Fester, you play Claude.
Darling, I'm so happy.
I think Cousin Itt has finally found himself.
That isn't easy under all that hair.
To make sure the play is a success, I'm going to hire a big director.
- Where will you find a big director?
- In the directory, where else?
And I, Eric Von Bissell, will make the decisions.
Remember that, Bennie.
I am the director.
You are only my agent.
Okay, okay.
Only just don't blow the job.
How come this guy Addams to call you, anyhow?
Probably remembered some of my more distinguished pictures.
Pretty good memory.
- When was your last one?
1932?
- Never mind that.
Addams says he has a great play and a great cast.
This could be the start of an entirely new career.
Fine start.
I do not direct home-talent plays.
Oh, what he means is that his fee is too high, Mr. Addams.
I'll do better than that.
I'll give him 50 thousand.
- Dollars?
- Dollars?
I think there's $60,000 there.
You can keep the change.
Well, money isn't everything.
My talent, my reputation.
Excuse us just a moment, please.
Come with me.
- What do you think, my dear?
- Don't worry, darling.
When they read your play, they'll be dying to do it.
Was Cousin Itt yelling for help?
That's the scene from the third act, when Mabel's father is after him with a sword.
My, he certainly makes it sound convincing.
Well, he really puts feeling into it.
Excuse me, my dear.
Mr. Addams, my client has decided to do your play, after thinking it all over.
I knew you'd come around, old man.
Of course, this living room is hardly a Broadway theater.
By george, you're right, this play should be on Broadway.
What?
Wednesday's party will serve as an out-of-town tryout.
That does it.
Get another director.
- Think of the challenge.
- No.
- Think of the prestige.
- No.
- Think of the money.
- I do it.
- You rang?
- Call Cousin Itt, will you, Lurch?
- Gone.
- Nonsense.
Have Fester help you find him.
- Gone, too.
- Gone?
But who'll play Claude?
Me.
Something is rotten in Denmark.
Not in Denmark.
In the playroom.
Gomez, the old chest.
Quick, open it up.
Great Scott!
I know you're shy, Cousin Itt, but this is ridiculous.
Uncle Fester?
How shocking.
- Help!
Get me out of here!
Help.
- Gomez, darling.
Get me out of here.
Uncle Fester, how could you do that to Cousin Itt?
Him?
What about me?
Somebody grabbed me from behind and threw me in there and locked me up before I knew what was happening!
I think I'm beginning to understand.
Come out, Lurch.
There will be no more of this.
If anything happens to Cousin Itt the play is off.
- Come.
- Come along, Itt.
Well?
Oh, stop worrying about your reputation.
Nobody's going to see this crummy play anyhow.
That's right.
Put it on and run like a thief.
Gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for.
We give you our star, Cousin Itt.
What is that?
- That's Cousin Itt, our leading man.
- Really a new face, eh?
New face?
I don't see no face at all.
- I am a director.
Not a barber.
- Von B. But a true artist overcomes all obstacles.
Oh, Gomez, darling, I do so adore temperamental artists.
Thank you, darling.
Well, all right, let's run through the opening scene now.
Mrs. Addams, will you please stand over there?
You and that.
Now, you're madly in love, but your father has forbidden you to marry him.
And so you are telling Claude.
- Go.
- "Darling Claude, "my father has forbidden our nuptials".
Stop it!
Stop it!
- Is something wrong?
- "Something wrong"?
- Terrible!
- Sounded fine to me.
Oh, that's impossible.
I will not work with such insanity!
Please.
Cousin Itt is very sensitive.
Where'd he go?
Where any sensitive artist would go when his feelings are wounded.
Up the chimney.
Come down, Cousin Itt.
He didn't mean it.
Oh, dear, now see what you've done.
He likes it up there.
Think of your career, your public Well, anyway, it was a soft answer.
- Please tell him you're sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- Say it again.
- 60,000 bucks.
He looks like a raccoon and talks like a gopher, - but he has possibilities.
- Thank you.
Cousin Itt, did you hear that?
I knew you wouldn't let a little clash of temperament wreck a great work of art.
- Come on.
- Gomez.
Mr. Von Bissell may have a point.
I do think Itt's voice is a bit too fast for the average listener.
- I never noticed that.
- Yes, I noticed it in that last scene we did.
Perhaps we'd best take him down to the playroom and work on his voice.
Bring out that fine timbre.
Great idea, but we'll have to watch out for splinters.
Now, let's try it once more, Cousin Itt.
And slowly.
"The rain in Spain "stays mainly on the plain".
No, no, no.
Slower, Cousin Itt, much slower.
Let's bring out those nice pear-shaped tones.
Excuse me.
Maybe he'd give us pear-shaped tones, if we gave him a pear-shaped head.
That's a brilliant idea.
Let's try it.
Oh, not too much, dear, just a nice pear shape.
There.
That ought to do it.
Now.
"The rain in Spain "stays mainly on the plain".
Oh, dear, it's not a bit better.
No wonder.
I got the wrong end of him in here.
His voice is much too high.
I wish we could lower it.
Maybe we should drop him down a well.
Sorry, it was only a suggestion.
Gomez, darling, I do remember reading somewhere where if you put marbles in your mouth, it gives you nice round tones.
You're right, querida.
Use mine.
Here, Cousin Itt.
Put these in your mouth.
Now, let's try it again.
"The rain in" They're delicious?
But you're not supposed to eat them.
Cousin Itt, they were my good dibbies!
I won them off of Pugsley.
Really, Cousin Itt.
Now, here.
- No, no, no.
- Oh, no, darling, it's all right.
Here, just put these in your mouth, and hold them.
Let's try a new phrase.
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch".
Yes.
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch".
"ditch is mainly full of" By Jove, I think he's got it.
No, now try it again, nice and easy.
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of" Again.
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch".
He has got it.
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch"!
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch".
"The witch's ditch is mainly full of pitch".
"If you love me, gentle Claude, "I pray thee, tell me so".
Itt, we're waiting.
- What's the getup for?
- Lf you go Hollywood, go all the way.
- Which one is their cousin?
- Maybe both of them.
Cue again.
"I pray thee, tell me so".
"Lady, by yonder blessed moon" Pardon me.
You may go out and play, Throckmorton.
"Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear, "that tips with silver all these dead treetops, "while vultures croak in ecstasy, "I dare to love thee, ere my head your father chops".
Bravo!
Bravo!
Von Bissell, a star is born.
It's a miracle.
It'll take more than a miracle.
- But I'll try.
- Good.
Fester, get the cast together.
All right, everybody.
On stage.
Come on, Itt, over there.
Really, old man, you're not addressing a peasant, you know.
You're speaking to the star.
I shall inform you when I'm ready.
"Soft!
What light through yonder window breaks" If the play is a success he'll be absolutely impossible.
Isn't that wonderful?
Well, I think I'll go fix my makeup.
Querida, use that baking powder number four.
It looks absolutely magnificent on you.
- Bubele.
- That word.
Darling, please.
Bissell now, bubele later.
Yes.
And to think that I once directed for a producer like Sam Derrick.
Sam Derrick!
By Jove, there's a real producer.
I can see it now.
Derrick producing, you directing.
Sure hit.
I'll have my office draw up a contract and get him over here.
Oh, no!
Please.
Oh, that would ruin me.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello, Addams here.
I want you to get Sam Derrick, the big producer, over here immediately.
Fine.
He'll be here tomorrow.
Von Bissell?
Bennie?
Then they just ran out the door and disappeared.
Just as well.
I was going to dismiss the old boy.
Dismiss Von Bissell?
He tended to limit my artistic capabilities.
What do you mean by that, Lurch?
Just That's quite enough.
You may go to your room.
I simply can't abide insolence.
Dear, we've never had this sort of ill-feeling before.
That's true, Itt.
Besides, Lurch is much more than a servant around here.
And I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask you to Mommy, Daddy.
Hello, Wednesday, darling, welcome home.
Did you enjoy school?
Pugsley flunked spelling again.
A real Addams.
I didn't flunk anything.
I was too excited about my birthday play.
I'm sorry, child, you'll have to forget about the play.
Forget about it?
I have no time for that sort of foolishness.
I've decided to do Hamlet for Mr. Derrick tomorrow.
"It's a far, far better thing" No, that was Dickens.
We'd better get some hair remover and see if that's really Itt under there.
Darling, you run along and play.
Everything is going to be all right.
Oh, it's all my fault, Gomez.
When I changed his voice, I changed his whole personality.
Oh, it's not your fault, it's just It's just Well, come to think of it, it is your fault.
If we could only get his sweet voice back again.
I know he'd be his dear self.
Morticia.
These may help you get through to him.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, dear.
So now I realize what a mistake it all was.
- A mistake?
- Yes, with your new voice, you sound just like any other actor.
Mr. Derrick wants something new and different.
You may have a point there.
And your old voice was wonderful.
We must get it back.
It was so original, so different.
That's true.
I'm so glad you have an open mind about it.
Well, we might just as well start now.
Now, repeat after me.
"The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain".
No, speed it up, Cousin Itt, speed it up.
Now let's try a different phrase.
Now, try that, very quickly.
"The bats in hats stay mainly on the flats".
Rather silly expression, don't you think?
Please let's try to concentrate, Cousin Itt.
We must get your old voice back.
Now.
I'm sorry, my dear, but it simply won't come out that way.
If you'll excuse me, I must rehearse.
Big day tomorrow, you know.
"Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio".
"To be, or not to be, that is the question".
Poor Wednesday, she's so upset because Cousin Itt won't do the play.
Itt will be on his way to Broadway tonight.
I kind of hate to see the little pest go.
Mr. Derrick.
How do you do?
I'm told you have an actor you want me to meet.
Well, I am a very busy man.
"To be, or not to be, that is the question.
"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer "the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, "or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing end them"?
Amazing.
Incredible!
We leave for Hollywood tonight.
- Hollywood?
- But I thought Broadway was in New York.
Madam, I am on my way out to Hollywood to do a picture.
The Hairy Beast from the Mars Canals.
And he'll be perfect in the title role.
And we'll play it with no makeup.
The Hairy Beast of Me?
Play the Why, you Lurch!
Follow me.
But - Good old Cousin Itt.
- He's his own sweet self again.
Pugsley and I just traded dynamite caps.
Uncle Fester, Gomez is writing a new play.
"If you prick us, do we not bleed?
"If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
"If you poison us, do we not die?
"If you wrong us, shall we not "revenge"?
Wonderful, darling, sounds so original.
Oh, oh, thank you.
You should hear the big scene.
This character, Charlie, can't pay back the $20 he owes.
This other fellow, Pete, demands a pound of flesh.
$20 for a pound of flesh?
- Sounds fine to me.
- It does?
Yeah, you should go in the butcher shop and see the prices they're getting.
That's true.
Well, enough work for tonight.
To bed, querida, to bed.
Yes.
To bed, darling.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Thank you, Thing.
Congratulations.
Darling, you remembered.
How could I forget our 13th anniversary?
It started on the stroke of midnight.
Oh, I'm so excited, I can't get it open.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
Oh, darling, what a sensible gift.
A bat net.
Querida, it's a nightgown.
Lace.
For our 13th.
Oh, darling, it's beautiful.
And my favorite color, too.
Black.
You're ravishing.
Congratulations!
Congratulations!
Happy anniversary!
Thank you, darlings.
Well, now, this is a surprise.
You didn't think we'd forget your anniversary.
Not the 13th.
That's the lucky one.
Have you and Father really been married 13 years?
Oh, yes.
And there were those who thought it would never happen.
I still can't believe it.
Mama and Morticia, let's not go into that tonight.
Oh, that's my favorite story next to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
Please tell us.
Well, all right.
Let's everybody get comfortable.
Now, originally, your father wasn't supposed to marry me.
He was supposed to marry my sister, Ophelia.
Aunt Ophelia?
- She was the catch of the season.
- Aunt Ophelia?
- Whoever said that?
- Her mother.
Granny Frump, my old school chum from Swamp Town High.
I'll never forget that day.
The sun was shining and the birds were singing.
I knew we were in for trouble.
Gomez, are you gonna spend your whole life sitting there when romance is on the way?
How can I think of romance when my bronchial tubes are collapsing?
You're the one that's collapsing.
Been sitting at that contraption for 22 years.
It's time you tried a girl.
I don't like girls.
Well, you can't marry a vaporizer.
I'll get it, Lurch.
Who could that be?
It can be the big surprise I've arranged for you.
Mrs. Frump and her daughter Ophelia.
Pull yourself together, Gomez.
You may be meeting the girl you're going to marry.
Lurch, they're ganging up on me.
What'll I do?
- Run.
- Run?
But where?
The Foreign Legion?
It's too far.
How about the American Legion?
Esther Frump!
Oh, it's good to see you again, Frumpy.
You haven't changed a bit since Swamp Town High.
And neither have you.
And this is my beautiful daughter, Ophelia.
That is my handsome son, Gomez.
Give him your hand, Ophelia.
Go, go!
- Why so pale and wan, fair Gomez?
- My head's stuffed.
Oh, poor, poor laddie.
I know just the thing for that.
- You do?
- Yes.
- Well, how is it now?
- It's gone to my back.
Oh, how nice.
- Boys are always falling for Ophelia.
- She's a handy one.
It was not for nothing she had all those judo and karate lessons.
Every girl should know judo and karate.
I lost one.
- One what?
- Daughter.
My young one, Morticia.
Oh, there she is.
Come on, Kitty cat.
Oh, you're so stubborn.
- I'm Gomez Addams.
- I'm Morticia Frump.
That's my pet pet.
- Kitty cat likes to eat.
- I like cats.
What's in there?
- My plant.
- Plant?
In there?
Oh, she bites.
Her name is Cleopatra.
And this is my doll.
Her name's Marie Antoinette.
I chopped off her head.
That's my Morticia.
I'm keeping her under wraps until my Ophelia's married.
Had to bring her along 'cause I couldn't get anybody to sit with her cat.
Well, it's not easy to find lion-sitters these days.
After eating, Kitty likes to exercise.
We've a nice garden.
She can run around it.
I'll show you.
Gomez?
She can find it herself.
Gomez, why don't you and Ophelia take a walk in the garden?
- Oh, it's too chilly out there.
- Ophelia will warm you up.
I'd better get my coat on.
A coat?
In July?
Well, it is more becoming.
I just wanna keep my bronchial tubes warm.
Yeah, you wouldn't want a son-in-law with cold bronchial tubes, would you?
Now, you and Ophelia run along and have fun.
Fair Gomez, take my hand.
Coming.
- That boy of yours is all boy.
- So is that girl of yours.
Well, let's plan the wedding.
What else do you like to do?
On rainy nights, I like to snuggle into bed with a mustard plaster.
"We are such stuff as dreams are made on".
- Do you like to dream, Gomez?
- I have better nightmares when I'm awake.
My dreams are of D'Artagnan, of Don Quixote who will tilt his lance against the foe.
Like this!
Come on, now, Cleopatra, have some nice zebra burger.
All right, I'll up the dowry to 3,000, make it a six-layer cake, and supply the food, music and preacher.
And I'll supply the guests.
Fair?
It seems fair.
I hope Ophelia finds Gomez to her taste.
She's very particular.
- Back so soon, Gomez?
- It's getting chilly out there.
I have to get my cape.
Would you like to join us in the garden?
Could we dig some graves, for my dolls?
I like to, but I'm afraid it would be too strenuous for me.
Well, then I'd rather stay here.
This one's name's Anne Boleyn.
My favorite person in history is Ivan the Terrible.
Oh, he was sweet.
Fair Gomez, is there anything you'd like to do?
Yes, go into a coma.
Oh, he does have a delicious sense of humor.
- And he shall be rewarded.
- You're going to leave?
Nonsense.
I'm going to amuse thee, sire.
- I told you, she's all talent.
- And beauty.
Isn't it wonderful, son?
I I I've never heard anything like it.
And would you believe it?
She's a great cook, too.
Here, hold my strings.
I'll whip you up a lunch you'll never forget.
I'm sure of it.
Ophelia cooks all day just so she can do dishes.
She loves to do dishes.
- She does?
- She loves water.
She's forever jumping into fountains and little brooks.
Even tubs and sinks.
Her cooking's good, though.
- Gomez, you didn't eat a thing.
- I never eat lunch.
It spoils my dinner.
You didn't eat much, either.
Oh, Ophelia's a marvelous cook but I don't like those kind of lunches.
What kind do you like?
Oh, crunchy things, like fried eye of newt, or barbequed turtle tips.
- Or cold yak?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Morticia, stop talking about those crazy dishes of yours.
Yes, Mama.
They don't sound crazy to me.
They sound yummy.
Oh, Gomez.
You better go now.
Good idea.
She's not outside, silly, she's in the kitchen.
- I know.
- Go on, you bashful boy.
Your bashful girl is waiting.
Come in, come in, the water's fine.
Come along, come along.
You can dry.
It's like playing house.
Thanks.
Come, come.
Dry, dry.
- I think I chipped that one.
- Slightly.
Must be the hard water.
Oh, no.
It's just a funny-shaped dish.
Did I do that?
No, our Aunt Trivia sent us a whole dozen of these cup handles.
It's beautiful.
This one's unbreakable.
Well, it used to be.
Gomez.
Let's play hide-and-seek.
- But my bronchitis.
- Nonsense!
Here, you hide here.
No, no, I'd find you there.
That's the first place I'd look.
I know.
I'll hide and you seek.
Tell me, do you think I'm sweet, kind and unselfish?
You say the sweetest things.
Thank you, Thing.
Has anyone ever told you you have the softest brown eyes?
No.
Besides, my eyes are blue.
No wonder no one has ever told you.
- You found me!
- It wasn't easy.
Now, you've earned your reward.
Drink to me only with thine lips.
- How was that?
- That was green.
- Now, you hide and I'll seek you.
- Good idea.
No, no, no!
Not that way.
That way is the primrose path of dalliance.
That way.
- What color did you say your eyes were?
- Blue.
Keep them that way.
By the way, how old are you, pigtails?
- 22.
- Really?
I thought you were much older.
Oh, there you are, Gomez.
Congratulate me!
Congratulate me!
Gomez and I are going to be married.
- Hallelujah!
- Love at first sight!
And I only twisted his arm once.
Morticia?
- You will be my bridesmaid.
- Thank you, Ophelia.
- Your bridal bouquet.
- Thorns?
Oh, no.
I want daisies, buttercups and fresh weeds.
I'll go down to the bogs and pick you some.
- Congratulations, Gomez.
- I tried to run away.
- You'll have beautiful children.
- I won't have them.
She'll have them.
- You'll both have them.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
I don't want to marry Ophelia.
Oh, my, that is a problem.
Oh, what lovely trains.
I just adore trains.
You do?
Well, let's give them a whirl.
These trains always take my mind off troubles.
What's that?
That's my friend, Thing.
- What a charming helper.
- He's been my companion since childhood.
You You don't think he's peculiar, do you?
Of course not.
We must accept our friends for what they are.
Here, you run the trains.
Isn't it exciting?
One train going east, the other one going west.
I have an idea.
What if they crash, head-on?
Better still, I'll blow them up!
Now, you take that switch.
When they meet at the bridge, wham!
- You spoke French.
- Yes.
Say it again.
- Something strange is coming over me.
- What?
For the first time in my life, my sinuses are clear!
How's your bronchitis?
It's gone!
My bronchitis is gone.
I don't know what I'm doing, but I can't help it.
I could help it but I don't want to.
Speak some more French.
Anything.
Oh, Gomez, please.
We must think of your betrothed.
My darling sister.
Oh, yes.
What'll we do?
- I have it.
- What?
I'll call my Uncle Fester.
Why, thank you, Thing.
Sweet old Uncle Fester.
He used to write an advice-to-the-Iovelorn column.
He'd still be doing it, too, if everybody hadn't started suing him.
Darn it.
A person just can't relax around here.
- Hello?
- Hello?
You'll have to talk louder.
Hello, Uncle Fester?
It's me, Morticia.
Morticia who?
Morticia Frump.
Morticia Frump?
I'm your niece.
That Morticia Frump.
Uncle Fester, I'm madly in love with Gomez Addams but he's engaged to marry my sister, Ophelia.
What should I do?
Forget him.
Anybody that'd marry your sister, Ophelia, must be a nut!
- What did he say?
- He wasn't home.
I'll speak to my Cousin Itt.
He's had lots of personal experience in affairs of the heart.
- A real ladies' man.
- Oh, he sounds perfect.
- Where is he?
- In his favorite nook, up the chimney.
Up the chimney?
Well, sometimes he prefers the broom closet.
As a matter of fact, he sort of looks like a broom.
Well, not really a broom.
A mop!
- Sounds fascinating.
- Yes.
Don't go away.
Say something else in French.
Cousin Itt!
I know you hate to be disturbed.
But I've got to talk to you.
Cousin Itt, my whole future is at stake and all you can think of is your own selfish pleasure.
Is that your final answer?
Well, at least you're keeping an open mind.
Cousin Itt, you've got to help me!
If you come down, I'll let you play with my octopus.
You can use my vaporizer!
I'll let you blow up one of my trains.
Cousin Itt, I knew I could count on you.
I always said blood is thicker than water, and everyone says you're thicker than both.
Itt, I'm in love.
No, she hasn't got a friend for you.
Please, you've got to listen to my problem.
Thank you.
You're such a suave, sophisticated man of the world and I thought you could give me some advice.
You see, I'm engaged to one girl and I love another.
What should I do?
Isn't that against the law?
Oh, come on, Itt.
An old roué like you ought to be able to figure something out.
Think.
Boy, you really are thinking.
Really?
Well, you sure make it sound like a sensible way out.
I'll tell Morticia.
She's the one I'm in love with.
Thanks a lot, Itt.
Underneath all that hair, you really are What are you underneath all that hair?
Roots?
Makes sense.
You better get up the chimney before Mama grabs your place.
Enjoy yourself!
And thanks a lot, Itt.
Hello, birdie.
My, you sing pretty, too.
Morticia.
Cousin Itt has the perfect solution to all my problems.
- What did he say?
- He said I should shoot myself.
It does sound rather simple.
I'll join you.
Be my guest.
Well, au revoir.
That's French.
Not here, darling.
In the hereafter.
In the hereafter.
- And did you die?
- No.
We had the guns at the ready and just as I was about to say "three," Thing reached out and snatched them away.
Thing never could stand noise.
But what happened with Aunt Ophelia?
We'll tell you the rest some other evening.
That's right, children.
It's time for bed.
- Come on.
- Go on.
I almost forgot my shortcut.
Dear Uncle Fester.
Every time he hears the story of our romance, it gives him such a lift.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Missed.
That's breathtaking.
- My painting?
- The thunder.
Your painting is absolutely indescribable.
It is inspiring, working between the flashes of lightning.
- It does something for one's eyes.
- It gives your work character.
Evocative of the great artists of the past.
Really darling?
Like whom?
Well, Toulouse-Lautrec.
- No, this is a much smaller canvas.
- Whistler's Mother?
Darling, she never painted.
That's right, she was too busy whistling.
Pugsley, Wednesday, why aren't you in bed?
I thought we put you to bed hours ago.
We couldn't sleep.
It's so nice and gloomy.
This is the best storm since lightning put the short circuit in Uncle Fester.
Remember all those red, white and blue flashes coming from his head?
- It was a beautiful sight, wasn't it?
- It was indeed lovely.
But this is no time for sentimental reminiscences.
Come along children, I'm going to read you a nice bedtime story.
But we don't want a bedtime story.
But darling, I was going to read one of your favorites, dear Mr. Poe's Murder in the Rue Morgue.
Poe does have a way with whimsy.
We'd rather hear the rest of the story about how you and Father got married.
Now, let's not go into that old chestnut.
Gomez, darling, what a terrible way to talk about our beautiful romance!
Darling, I'm not talking about our beautiful romance, it's what led up to it.
Nonsense.
It's a true-to-life adventure and the children should know all about it.
- All right.
- Now come along.
Let's sit right down here, and get comfortable.
Now, where were we?
You just talked French, and Father just kissed you.
No, they were going to shoot each other because Father had promised to marry Aunt Ophelia.
Now then, plans for the wedding were in full swing.
Your Aunt Ophelia was still trying to amuse your father.
I was just sitting there, cutting out paper dolls.
Faster, Lurch, faster.
- I told you, she's all talent.
- And beauty.
Isn't it wonderful, son?
Well, that's all settled.
We can have the wedding right here in the living room.
Well, it's not exactly the main ballroom of the Ritz but I guess it'll do.
My Gomez and your Ophelia do make a lovely couple, don't they?
Would you mind singing some other song, please?
- Kiss Me Again?
- I can't, - my lips are chapped from all that vapor.
- Oh, poor, poor laddie.
A sudden change in altitude is good for the sniffles.
I do hope your vaporizer won't interfere with our honeymoon?
By george, it will.
Shall we call it off?
No.
Mater?
- Fair, shy Gomez doth seem reluctant.
- Reluctant?
He's always at your feet.
Methinks he's trying to weasel out of it.
Poor dear.
He must really be sick.
- Well, the dowry isn't settled yet.
- Well, settle it, settle it.
Details bore me.
What are you two whispering about?
Ophelia refuses to go through with the ceremony, unless Gomez puts his Brazil nut plantation in her name.
Well, we already gave you half his elephant herd.
Including the tusk rights.
I think it's a very generous offer.
- That's clever.
- It's yours.
How do you do that?
I don't know, it just always comes out that way.
Morticia, this is your sister Ophelia's wedding, not yours.
Yes, Mama.
Now how about coming up with a decent dowry?
- Not a nickel over 5,000.
- Oh, come, come now, you can do better than that.
That's an insult.
Insult me some more.
If we push the ceremony up to 2:00.
What do you say, son?
He accepts.
Oh, fair Gomez, from now on your vapor is my vapor.
Come child.
You need a wedding dress.
I know a seamstress that is fast, cheap and fairly accurate.
You'll have to excuse me, I have a wedding cake to bake.
We're alone.
Together.
- Morticia.
- Gomez.
- Morticia.
- Gomez.
- May I call you Tish?
- Of course.
I've waited for this moment, Tish.
So have I. Congratulations.
- They shouldn't leave us alone like this.
- It's torture, madness, and very bad judgment on their part.
How can I marry Ophelia when I love you?
- What does Emily Post say?
- Not a word.
- It's not that your sister isn't a nice girl - Sweet.
- Muscular.
- An angel.
A doll.
It's just that I can't stand her.
- Why don't you tell her so?
- Because I'm a weak, sniveling coward.
Besides, I gave her my word.
But what does the word of a weak, sniveling coward mean?
Means I'm going to be married at 2:00.
Uncle Fester.
Oh, how wonderful to see you again.
Morticia, I wouldn't have missed your wedding for anything.
Well, it's not me who's getting married, Uncle Fester.
It's Ophelia.
Ophelia?
What kind of a nut did she finally snag?
That one.
Gomez, I'd like for you to meet my Uncle Fester.
- So you're the lucky bridegroom, eh?
- Bridegroom, yes.
Lucky, no.
Uncle Fester, Gomez and I are madly in love.
Then why don't you two get hitched?
Ophelia's my sister.
I couldn't betray her.
Besides, it would break her heart.
It's bad for the digestion.
All we have to do is find her another man.
Who's the little guy talking to the servant?
That's my Cousin Itt.
He's the family intellectual.
The longhair of the family.
He looks it.
Is he married?
Free as a tumbleweed.
He looks that, too.
He'd be a perfect groom for Ophelia.
He'd never see what he's getting into.
Oh, fair Gomez, I'm back.
You two run along and leave the matchmaking to me.
Uncle Fester shot the arrow that brought my mother and father together.
The arrow and the gun.
Leave it to me.
Uncle Fester, how sweet of you to come to my wedding.
Biggest mistake since Uncle Tic married Aunt Phobia.
But they were a perfect match.
He had two left feet, and she had two right ones.
It was a mere physical attraction.
I love Gomez's soul.
For 50,000 fish, you're entitled to a lot more than that.
Now, there's more your type.
That's Gomez's Cousin Itt.
I'll introduce you.
Cousin Itt, this is Ophelia.
Charmed.
I love a mystery.
Yes, she is direct.
Now, if you two kids are smart, you'll get married before 2:00.
Exactly 11:31.
- Flatterer.
- He means it, too.
It isn't every girl he calls a geekle-gackle-gookle.
Would you like to pick some daisies?
They have very deep roots.
Why don't you go out in the garden?
They have some lovely deadly nightshade and some wonderful poison sumac.
Nay!
I do not like poison sumac.
It will not grow on my head.
Yes, perhaps I should have my head examined.
- They do have some lovely weeds.
- Weeds?
Why didn't you say so?
Silly, silly.
- Sorry, sorry.
- Let's go, Cousin Itt.
Weeds are my favorite flowers.
The seed has been planted.
The plot cannot fail.
Oops!
I forgot to tell them about the quicksand.
A few minutes under the hair dryer and you'll be as good as new.
And you, couldn't you see where you were going?
- Of course.
I fell in, didn't I?
- Fine time to go wading in quicksand.
You're supposed to be getting married.
I'd be willing to postpone it for a few years.
Oh, no, I'll jump right into my wedding dress.
I like feeling damp.
That was my favorite song, until just now.
Isn't that sweet?
The bridegroom's getting nervous.
Come on, we'd better help the bride dress.
I haven't been this excited since Aunt Trivia's funeral.
Uncle Fester, what happened?
I tried, but I guess Cousin Itt just wasn't her type.
No accounting for certain tastes.
She doesn't even like poison sumac.
- What do I do now?
- Lf it'll make you feel any better, you can cry during the ceremony.
Well, that will make me feel a little better.
- Oops!
I forgot to turn off the dryer.
- Great Scott!
What do I do?
A little stretch on the rack and he'll be as good as new.
Couple more minutes under there, he'd have disappeared completely.
Really?
Maybe I should try that dryer.
Well, he's not up in the tower room.
He's not in the basement.
I looked there.
Cousin Itt, you shouldn't have looked in the chimney.
One spark, and you'd have gone up in flames.
Well, let's face it.
Your Gomez is gone, and my Ophelia is upstairs in tears.
Well, don't panic, he's around here somewhere.
You rang?
Lurch, have you seen my son Gomez?
No, Mrs. Addams.
Where can that boy be?
The river?
Imagine, a jilted Frump.
We'll find him.
Now all of you spread out, and keep your eyes open.
You do the best you can.
To marry, or not to marry?
That is the question.
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous Hello, there.
How did you find me?
I heard you calling.
That wasn't me, that was Cousin Fungus.
I'd better turn off the echo.
Thing?
- Is Cousin Fungus coming to the wedding?
- Oh, no, he doesn't get out much.
He's lived in a cave in back of the tunnel for 30 years.
What exquisite taste.
Do you like it?
It's a divine tunnel.
- Then stay here with me.
- Just the two of us?
No, the four of us.
Cousin Fungus and Thing.
We can play four-handed solitaire.
You do paint a lovely picture.
But we can't.
You must think of Ophelia.
I did.
That's why I'm here in the tunnel.
Think of all the many romances that started out a bit wobbly and then worked out.
Think of Romeo and Juliet.
They died.
But what fun they had those last three days.
I suppose there's nothing we can do.
Courage, mon ami.
- You spoke French.
- Gomez, now control yourself.
We don't want to give Cousin Fungus the wrong idea.
- Yes, yes.
- Now come along.
Poor Ophelia's crying her eyes out.
That might be an improvement.
Come on out, Gomez.
You coward.
Come on, Gomez, come out and get married.
Uncle Fester, I thought you were our friend.
I am, but we can't have a jilted Frump.
It'd be a stain on our family escutcheon.
And our family escutcheon is messy enough.
Why don't you just tell Ophelia the truth?
- Gomez is a weak, sniveling coward.
- That's right.
Wouldn't you rather be a strong, masterful he-man?
- Too dangerous.
- It doesn't have to be.
Not if you go about it right.
Why don't we try it?
Uncle Fester, you be Ophelia.
You're kind, sensitive, quiet and understanding.
She certainly has changed.
And you are the new Gomez.
You're decisive, direct and definite.
- I'm afraid.
- That's pretty definite.
- Thank you.
- Uncle Fester, you're Ophelia, you're here, playing with your lyre.
- Gee!
I didn't know I could play this thing.
- Uncle Fester.
Now, Gomez, put these things down.
There.
Now, don't be frightened.
Go in there and talk to her.
- Ophelia, I don't want to marry you.
- Gee, thanks.
No, no, no!
- Thank you very much?
- No, Uncle Fester, you have to put up more resistance.
- Gotcha.
- Now.
Come on.
Go again.
- Ophelia, I won't marry you.
- What!
- Uncle Fester!
- I'll shoot you this time!
- I was just fooling.
- Let go of me, I'll shoot him in the back!
- Uncle Fester, no, no.
- Just fooling.
Dear, this isn't working out at all.
I know, I'll play Ophelia.
Shucks!
That isn't fair.
- Well, you can play my mother.
- All right.
Ophelia, your voice needs tuning.
It's that just that I'm so excited about my nuptials.
Here comes my betrothed now.
Here comes my betrothed now.
- Ophelia, I - All right, son, speak up, speak up.
Mrs. Frump, I'm afraid I can't marry your daughter.
- What!
I'll shoot him in the - Uncle Fester Mother, please.
Let the dear boy speak his mind.
You were saying?
I was saying, there is only one person in the whole world I could ever marry, - and that one person is - Who?
- You.
- Gomez.
- Morticia.
- Gomez.
- Morticia.
- Gomez.
Morticia.
It's beautiful.
Hey, we better hurry, that minister charges by the hour.
Come on.
Coming, coming.
Aren't you glad you decided to go through with it?
Delighted.
- My, doesn't she look lovely?
- A real Frump.
Great Scott!
Who is that?
Well, that's just Morticia, with her hair all combed out.
- Sloppy kid.
- A lovely child - has become a breathtaking woman.
- Ophelia?
- Morticia.
- Who?
Ophelia.
There is a customary question I have to ask.
Does anyone object to this ceremony taking place?
Yes.
- Who?
- Me.
I know this will come as a shock to you, Ophelia, but I must tell you the truth.
I'm unworthy of you.
- Really?
- I'm sheltered, I'm spoiled, cowardly.
- That's true.
- Not only that, I'm I'm irascible and unpleasant and stupid.
That's true, too.
- I have some endearing qualities.
- Like what?
Well - I'm rich.
- That's a very nice quality.
- Thank you.
- But you're still unworthy.
Besides, I think I've already found my true love.
My D'Artagnan, my Don Quixote, my knight in shining armor.
Sounds like me.
But I'm her uncle.
I couldn't bring myself to hurt you, Gomez, shatter your dreams.
But since you've confessed your unworthiness, you leave me no alternative.
Come, my love.
I might remind you that, as the saying goes, I get paid whether the ball game's rained out or not.
Fear not, a wedding will be held here this day.
He's looking this way.
Do you think he means me?
The woman for me is that graceful, elegant creature standing over there.
He does mean me!
- Will you marry me?
- I thought you'd never ask.
Oh, your hair That dress, it drives me wild.
I'll never wear another.
- Do you really want to marry this man?
- I certainly do.
- But you've only known him a few days.
- What better way to get acquainted?
Right.
Friends, we're going to try it again.
We're going to proceed with the marriage of Gomez Addams and - What's your name, child?
- Morticia Frump.
My favorite Frump.
That's how your father and I got married.
- Did you like the story?
- Yes, it was so romantic.
- Pugsley?
- All romances are a little goofy.
Did Aunt Ophelia marry Cousin Itt?
No, I'm afraid it was just a summertime romance.
Cousin Itt turned out to be too much of a playboy.
I'd like to hear more about that.
It's much too stimulating this time of night.
Now you run upstairs and pop into bed, while you can still enjoy this lovely thunderstorm.
- Run along.
- Go on.
Perhaps we should go upstairs and enjoy the thunderstorm.
Oh, darling, I can't.
I have to finish my painting.
Querida, must you paint tonight?
I want to capture this wonderful lightning.
Gomez, darling, look.
I've captured it.
Oh, yes.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Uncle Fester.
Lurch, I hope you don't mind my using your harpsichord.
It helps me in my composing.
How does it sound?
I say, Lurch, how does it sound?
How can I concentrate with Gomez tuning the harpsichord?
Uncle Fester, he's not tuning it.
He's composing on it.
- That's composing?
- What does it seem like?
Well, it seems like composing, but it sounds like tuning.
What are you composing, Gomez?
A sonata for three hands.
Three hands?
It'll give Lurch a chance to play duets with Thing.
Oh, that's very creative, darling.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
The seal has a coat of arms.
The only seal I ever saw had a coat of fur.
Could be from Princess Millicent.
Ah, yes.
Oh, she's arriving for an extended visit.
I thought princesses only lived in castles.
Princess Millicent is in reality Gomez's Aunt Millie, from Marshy Bottom, Iowa.
Then the coat of arms and the title is a fake, huh?
No, Aunt Millie picked those up years ago when she married a Prince Von Schlepp.
- Sounds glamorous.
- Not really.
Von Schlepp was a prince, but he was also a pauper.
- The poor man.
- That's usually what a pauper is.
He squandered Aunt Millie's money on foolish investments.
And when he died, all she had left was the title and a trunk full of worthless oil stock.
She's been living on her relatives ever since.
Poor thing.
Clothed only in a coat of arms.
Checkmate.
I've always wanted to meet your Aunt Millicent.
- She's certainly welcome here.
- Bravo, querida.
- Spoken like a true Addams.
- Thank you, darling.
And what's more, we must be especially nice to your Aunt To Princess Millicent.
She must never feel like a poor relation in this house.
In that case, we should give her the royal chamber.
- Royal chamber?
- Yeah, the one with the king-size bed.
Charming.
Your Highness.
The other hand.
Uncle Fester, what are you doing?
I was practicing to greet the Princess.
That's ridiculous.
She may have married a prince, but she's still Aunt Millie from Iowa.
My watches say 4:00.
That makes it exactly 2:30.
The princess should be here any minute.
The princess.
To the garage.
- Well, well, if it isn't Aunt Millie.
- It isn't.
It's Princess Millicent.
Of course.
Well, how are you, Princess?
You may call me "Your Highness".
It's a good thing I practiced.
This is my lovely wife Morticia.
Welcome, Your Highness.
And this is our Uncle Fester.
Guess this one's on me.
My luggage is outside.
You may rise.
Easy for you to say.
Fester, you'd better help Lurch with the princess' bags.
Yes.
It's not what I'm accustomed to.
But I suppose it's better than a hotel.
You'll love your chamber.
It has a beautiful view.
On a clear day you can see all the way to the swamp.
But, of course, who wants a clear day?
Would you like for me to help you unpack, Your Highness?
It's not necessary.
I'm traveling very light this trip.
Besides, my handmaiden will help me.
Handmaiden?
Handmaiden.
Allow me to present Lady Fingers.
How do you do, Lady Fingers?
She seems very lovely.
Comes from a fine family.
Her father used to be my footman.
And now I think I'll retire to my chambers.
Lurch will show you where they are.
- I thought she said she was traveling light.
- She is.
Lurch and Uncle Fester are traveling heavy.
I'm so glad she's here, though.
And with Lady Fingers.
I think she's just the companion that Thing has been longing for lately.
He's right, she's left.
The perfect match.
We'll see.
Thing.
My, aren't they the shy ones!
Lady Fingers, where are you?
I need you up here at once.
Oh, he missed his chance.
Don't worry, he'll have others.
He's handy that way.
It's about time you showed up.
When I give a command, I want it obeyed immediately.
I do hope Lady Fingers won't pick up slothful ways around here.
Oh, no.
How did you find your chamber?
- The bed is as hard as nails.
- Knew you'd like it.
And where on earth did you get those black drapes?
- I really had to shop for them.
- Ghastly.
When she brought Lady Fingers, I thought she was a true Addams.
Obviously, there's something wrong with her.
Well, the poor dear has suffered so, what with her husband dying.
Worse than that, he went broke.
I do hope she stays, for Thing's sake.
But she's accustomed to castles.
Yes, she does live in a dream world.
There must be some way we can make her feel at home.
We couldn't convert this place into a castle.
The ceilings are too low.
- We can do everything else.
- You mean You're reading my mind, aren't you, bubele?
Tish, that name.
Darling, control yourself.
Royalty now, bubele later.
Very well, but later you'll have to call me Sir Bubele.
Gomez, darling, do hurry.
The princess should be down any moment.
Oh, darling, you do make a dashing cavalier.
Not such a bad lady-in-waiting yourself.
I wonder what's keeping her.
Patience, my dear.
A lady-in-waiting must learn to wait.
Here she is.
What's wrong with him?
- Too big for his britches.
- That's quite obvious.
He left without being dismissed.
You may go.
Well, I can see this household will need a lot of training.
And now I wish to be entertained.
Do you hear?
I wish to be entertained.
Uncle Fester.
Coming.
Fester the Jester.
What will it be, Your Highness?
Sick jokes?
Elephant joke?
Limerick.
"There was a young man from Dakota" No limericks, huh?
How about stupid jokes?
They're my specialty.
See, this one stupe says to another, "Did you take a bath"?
And the other one says, "Is one missing"?
You may retire permanently.
Yes, Your Highness.
Mama, I understand you and the princess have had a spat.
That woman is driving me batty.
The only thing she'll let me serve is Chicken a la King.
Well, that's the royalty business.
Besides, Chicken a la King's rather tasty.
Without the feathers?
Some people have the dullest tastes.
Here you are, Lurch.
Now please try not to bow so low.
This is the third time I've had to mend them.
Must I Well, Lurch, maybe the princess will let you wear a suit of armor instead.
Those things wear like iron.
I'm so glad we kept up with our minuet.
It's so appropriate now.
Let them eat cake.
In the dungeon.
Off with their heads.
Isn't that sweet?
She's dreaming of the good old days.
I give up.
I want her to hear me.
On account of her, I've been up nights studying old joke books, learning card tricks, even old bird calls.
I just heard you do a vulture, Fester.
You were terrific.
That wasn't me.
That was Her Highness, snoring.
Nobody seems to be enjoying the princess' visit.
Except those two.
They finally got together.
Let's leave them alone.
Can I kiss your hand, Madame?
Dear Lurch, he's such an incurable romantic.
Just leave the bags here.
I'll send for them later.
Leaving us, Your Highness?
Is something wrong?
Everything is wrong.
He won't bow anymore.
And he doesn't amuse me.
And this morning, I found a sign on my door saying, "Princess, go home".
I'm moving to a hotel, and don't try to stop me.
I said don't try to stop me.
I wouldn't dream of it.
One moment, Your Highness.
This whole house is subversive.
To the hotel.
We're free, Lurch.
We're liberated.
Well, smile, Lurch, smile.
Gomez, darling, Mama tells me the princess is leaving.
Better than that, she's left.
She's gone to a hotel.
And you let her?
Dear, you know she can't afford it.
Oh, yes, she can.
Oil discovered in the desert?
Remember all those worthless oil stocks I told you Aunt Millie had?
They're not worthless anymore.
Aunt Millie can not only afford to live in a hotel, she can afford to buy it.
Hey, maybe we ought to get her back.
Oil's well that ends well.
"Oil's well".
Get it?
That's a joke.
You don't have to joke anymore, Fester.
You're no longer a court jester.
And you, Lurch, you can get back into long pants.
- We are going back to normal.
- Oh, wonderful.
The Addams family is a democracy again.
Exactly.
From now on, I give the orders around here.
- Gomez.
- But nobody has to obey them.
I'm sure glad I don't have to be funny anymore.
We all are, dear.
I just finished my sonata for three hands.
You rang?
Lurch, how would you like to play this with Thing?
Can't wait to get at it, eh?
Thing?
Thing, are you there?
Oh, Thing, Mr. Addams has finished his sonata for three hands and with Thing?
Thing, what is it?
Thing?
- Something seems to be wrong with him.
- Darling.
His pulse is rather sluggish.
We better contact the jungle and get Dr. Mbogo.
You know how those jungle witch doctors are, Gomez.
They just won't make house calls.
- I don't think he needs a doctor, dear.
- You mean he's beyond help?
You don't think he's sick?
- Lovesick.
- Of course.
It was written all over his cuticles.
I'd never have dreamt he'd take it that hard.
There's only one thing to do.
We have to get Lady Fingers back.
- But to do that, we must also bring back - Oh, no.
We must make the sacrifice for Thing's sake.
I'll have to start telling jokes again.
Buck up, Lurch.
As Mrs. Addams says, we must all make the sacrifice for Thing's sake.
We must think Thing.
Welcome, Your Highness.
We greet Your Highness.
Well, that's much better.
You see, even the pages have turned over a new leaf.
Children, you may go.
Allow me to assist you, Your Highness.
Lurch, come and bow for Princess Millicent.
- Is he gonna be able to make it?
- Oh, yes.
Mama let out the seat of his trousers with a couple of accordion pleats.
Accordion pleats?
Musical pants.
You see how glad we are to have you back, Your Highness?
Naturally.
Now that I'm rich again, you're all playing a different tune.
Especially Lurch.
Lurch, please show Her Highness to her chambers.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
- Have you got it, darling?
- Right here, cara mia.
Did you hear his knuckles pop?
True love.
- Did you see that?
- She certainly has aged.
That couldn't be Lady Fingers.
Maybe that's what she looks like without makeup.
Nonsense.
I'm going to ask the princess what this is all about.
She must be coming.
I can hear Lurch bowing.
Princess, what happened to Lady Fingers?
After I left here, she just moped and drooped all over the place.
You fired her?
Well, I'm certainly not going to have a handmaiden who just sits around twiddling her thumb.
This is ridiculous.
The whole idea was to get Lady Fingers back for Thing.
Now we're stuck with the princess and a claw who's old enough to be Thing's mother.
Lurch keeps bowing so much, his pants have to be retuned.
What is it, Princess?
One of my bracelets is missing.
- Maybe you miscounted.
- It was stolen.
- And I know who stole it.
Thing.
- Oh, no.
Don't contradict me.
And I insist he be searched immediately.
Just as I thought, he's gone.
Thing?
Thing?
She's right, he's gone.
You rang?
Lurch, Thing is missing.
Do you know where he went?
Of course he doesn't know.
Call the police.
Oh, must we?
Let's not be hasty, Your Highness.
I feel there's some explanation for the whole affair.
Gomez, darling, your wallet.
My wallet?
It's gone.
Good thing I carry my money in my sock.
No, no, darling.
Oh, dear.
She's locked herself in.
My wallet.
My bracelet.
My joke book.
My silverware.
Well, that seems to be all.
Then the old claw took it on the lam.
Esmeralda, a thief!
And an old hand at it, too.
If Thing were here, I'd apologize to him.
- Thing!
- Where have you been?
Lady Fingers!
Of course.
Thing went to find the woman he loved.
I hope you'll come back to me.
Oh, thank you.
We'll take a trip around the world.
But, Princess, you'd be separating her from Thing.
They can get married, and Thing can come along and work for me.
How about it, Thing?
By george, he's going to wait for her.
An engagement ring.
You've really taken to that accordion, Morticia.
Well, ever since our little incidents with the princess, I've grown a little accustomed to the sound.
You've become rather royalty-conscious yourself, darling.
Well, this outfit sort of makes me feel a bit more courtly.
It does have a certain je ne sais quoi.
Tish, that's French.
Morticia, querida, where are you?
Darling, please, not in that suit.
Oh, yes, yes.
You're right.
That music is pretty exciting, too.
Darling, I didn't play that.
That was Lurch, wasn't it?
He's really learned how to play those pants.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Nothing like a quiet evening at home.
Oh, the mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Did I hear the mail?
Well, it's probably just the usual stock dividends, I suppose.
Or another refund from the treasury department.
Gomez, darling, it's the tax bill on this house.
- Bully!
How much are they asking for?
- Well, let's see.
After the municipal fund, the sinking fund, the land improvements, it comes to a grand total of $84!
$84!
On this gem of a house?
- Why, that's an insult.
- See for yourself.
The simple case of a displaced decimal.
- It should read $8,400.
- More likely $84,000.
It shouldn't be a penny less for such a magnificent mansion as this.
Now, darling, you go right back to your Zen-Yogi.
- I'll handle this by phone.
- Good thinking, my dear.
Why, thank you, Thing.
Hello, tax department?
This is Mrs. Addams.
Yes, there's been a rather amusing typographical error on our tax bill.
$84.
Oh, thank you.
They realize there's been an error.
They're checking it out now.
Oh, yes.
And what is the revised?
- $8.40?
- Let me at it.
Hello, there.
Now, see here!
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
$8.40.
The insult supreme.
You're not going to take that lying down, are you?
Lying down?
Certainly not.
I'm going to stand right here and do a little thinking.
Gomez, I think we ought to pay a little visit to the Mayor.
Quick, Your Honor, it's that Addams family.
They've been here twice.
I'll stall them until you can duck down the fire escape.
Cut out the melodramatics, Clyde.
- They're our voters, aren't they?
- Well, anything is possible.
And there is an election coming up.
Now, show them in.
- This is the season to be friendly.
- Friendly to the Addams family?
- And they're taxpayers, aren't they?
- Lf you say so.
Mr. And Mrs. Addams coming up, sir.
Mrs. Addams, Mr. Addams, do forgive the delay.
Please sit down.
The work of your mayor is never done.
Thank you, Mr. Mayor.
Darling, show His Honor that ridiculous tax bill on our house.
- Here you are, sir.
- Ridiculous.
It is out.
Just a moment.
You never even looked at it.
Well, I didn't have to.
I've looked at your house.
- We'll cut it in half.
- The house?
No, no, dear lady.
The tax bill.
As a matter of fact, we'll cancel it altogether.
Or, to be really fair, we'll send you a rebate.
Great Scott, look at the time!
I'm going to be late for that cornerstone ceremony.
Do forgive me, do forgive me.
Goodbye.
Clyde!
Incompetence in office.
The bane of our existence.
To think that in the last election I voted for that unmitigated scoundrel.
Not only that, darling, you voted for him twice.
Well, I cast my first vote so early it slipped my mind.
Somewhere, someplace there must be a politician who's a little less of a conniving, bumbling hack than Mayor Henson.
But who?
I don't know who.
But if I find him, he's going to get some mighty strong support in this coming election.
Now, darling, put your hand up like this and repeat after me.
If I'm elected, ladies and gentlemen If I'm elected, ladies and gentlemen Let's face it.
Today you can't be elected without a political machine behind you.
And unfortunately, I don't have one.
Oh, yes, you do, dear.
Uncle Fester?
There.
Your old friend Wizzo.
The best machine a man can have behind him.
Come along, dear.
Say something to Wizzo, darling.
- Go on, anything.
- Anything?
Yeah, make a little speech.
All right.
Ladies and gentlemen.
By george, that's a first-rate political machine, all right.
It's been programmed for instant politics.
Would you like a smoke-filled room?
It also answers political questions.
All right, here's a political question.
How did a nincompoop like Henson ever get elected in the first place?
Oh, that's an easy one.
"Mayor Henson got elected by conniving, wheeling and dealing "and lots of razzle-dazzle".
I wish the whole world could have heard that.
It will, Gomez, it will.
And now, Wizzo, how can a fine, upstanding citizen like Gomez Addams defeat Mayor Henson?
"A fine, upstanding citizen like Gomez Addams can defeat Mayor Henson "by even more conniving, wheeling, dealing and razzle-dazzle".
I'm afraid there's still a few bugs left in Wizzo.
Fix it, Uncle Fester.
You're not going to let a little thing like that stop you, are you, bubele?
Tish - When you say that word - Well, are you?
If the enlightened citizens, my fair constituents of this glorious community do me the honor of electing me your mayor, I promise that And rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that the Addams campaign will remain dignified, on a high level and completely free from the scurrilous tactics of my conniving, double-dealing scoundrel of an opponent.
Three high-level copies of that speech, Thing, when you get around to it.
Thank you, Thing.
That's one, two, three.
Very good.
"Conniving, scurrilous" Excellent.
Excellent work, Thing.
- Gomez, darling.
- Yes, my dear.
It's time for your baby-kissing practice session.
Where would my campaign be without your firm hand on the tiller of the good ship Addams?
- Let's get started, dear.
- Right.
Yes, yes.
- Oh, Mr. Addams.
- Yes.
Both my baby and I did so love your speech.
We're both going to vote for you.
Thank you, madam.
And thank you, my manly little fellow.
Or girl, as the case may be.
- That perfume you're wearing.
- Oh, sir.
Mr. Addams.
Gomez!
It's the only way to run a campaign.
The press.
- I'm Brown from The Sun.
- Well, you certainly look it.
Well, obviously you're here to question me about my campaign.
- Fire away.
- Well, are you a candidate?
- No comment.
- No comment?
That's off the record.
Dear, I believe the young man wants to know what position you take.
My position?
Well, I grasp the club firmly, put the weight on my right foot and wham!
No, no, dear.
He wants you to make a statement.
Very well.
Look to the record.
- I'll make it easier for you.
- Very well.
How do you feel about slums?
Oh, preserving our historical landmark is his first consideration.
Start out picking on slums, you wind up doing away with swamps.
And when you do away with swamps where are the children going to play?
- Vicious cycle.
- You see.
- Lf you say so.
One last question.
- Yes, indeed.
How are you coming along collecting those 5,000 names that you need to get on the ballot?
At this very moment, two top members of my staff are busily Here they are now.
- Back so soon.
- And why not?
In two hours of tramping around we got more than 20,000 names.
And a lot of blisters.
Does that answer your question, my good man?
Yes, sir.
Don't forget the campaign slogan.
Yes.
"Gomez Addams.
Watch his smoke".
Catchy, isn't it?
Everybody's getting into the campaign.
Even I smoke occasionally.
- My, he's in a hurry.
- Probably has to make a deadline.
Nice man.
He just doesn't seem to know much about politics.
I know all that, but who are you going to vote for?
Who am I going to vote for?
Well, I'll tell you.
This Addams guy says he's for slums, swamps, smog, and the African tsetse fly.
Sounds kind of nutty, doesn't he?
Nutty?
Nutty like a fox.
It's a rib.
Don't you get it?
Sure.
He's teeing off with these politicians that make promises they know they're never going to keep.
- I'm voting for the Addams guy.
- Same here.
How about you?
I'm going to the nearest bar and get smashed.
- I can't believe it!
- Here are the actual figures, sir.
According to all the polls Addams is pulling out in front of you.
- But what do you suggest?
- A debate on TV.
A debate on TV?
Addams is a kook.
Get him on the air and prove it.
Look, we'll have the studio audience loaded with ringers, stacked questions.
Booing in all the right places.
Of all the mean, low-down conniving tricks Well, what are you standing there for?
Go and arrange it.
Fortune cookie.
Don't look now but there's a telephone call for you.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello?
Good morning, Mayor.
A debate?
I'd love to.
How's this for a theme?
"Resolved that boys and girls should not go steady until" What?
Oh, the political issues.
Isn't that a bit extreme?
Very well, we'll do it your way.
Fine.
I'll see you then.
- Morticia.
- You called?
The Mayor and I are going to debate on television.
Oh, darling, do you think you should?
Why not?
Some television producer might see me.
Open up a whole new career for me.
Oh, by the way, the Mayor is coming over tomorrow morning to issue a formal challenge.
He's bringing along some reporters to make sure I don't weasel out.
Me, weasel out?
That's not a bad idea.
Darling, television has been the waterloo of many an aspiring candidate.
But don't you worry, we'll have you perfectly rehearsed and ready.
Counselor in my despair, shining beacon in my darkest moments.
Maybe it will be better to weasel out.
No, the Addams family honor is at stake.
The very words of Lafayette Addams.
When he challenged the Duke of Burgundy to a duel?
Just before he skipped out of town.
Now, darling, I want the public to see the real Gomez Addams.
Oh, very well.
No, I don't think that's quite good for your public image.
- Hang from the chandelier?
- Just smile, dear.
Very sweet.
Now, dear, I want to make sure we get your best side.
How about this?
- No, that's no good.
- Like this?
No, that's no good, either.
Morticia, how's this?
This is his best side.
No, I believe facing the camera is a bit more customary.
Well, I can bring the camera around here.
No, dear, let's try that.
By george, Morticia, you are a resourceful director.
- Now, we need a little makeup.
- Makeup.
Oh, Uncle Fester, you only got one side.
That Lafayette Addams was no fool.
Darling, the minute you get on the air, I want you to square your shoulders, set your jaw, and put on your glasses, it makes you look so impressive.
Yes, that's it.
And I'll insist that the camera zoom in for a big head close-up.
Yes, my dear.
Let's try it, yes.
Now, stare.
That's it.
Close-up.
That was just a wee bit too close.
But you're getting it, darling.
I've gotten it.
Gomez, I was just going to test my new guillotine.
Would you like Fester, don't you know I'm going to debate the Mayor?
Can't you see I'm wrestling with major issues?
Major who?
Labor, foreign policies, social security.
Yeah, what do you think should be done about them?
That's what I was going to ask you.
You're no help at all.
Nothing but interruptions and distractions.
Uncle Fester, I want you to taste my new recipe.
Braised lion loins.
Say, that is tasty.
Something is the matter with Gomez.
He doesn't even want to play with my guillotine.
He has been acting strangely.
I'd better give this my personal attention.
Fourscore and nine years ago No.
Fourscore and ten years ago That doesn't sound right, either.
- Oh, bubele.
- Good morning, my dear.
Gomez, darling, I called you bubele.
The world will little note, nor long remember No.
Gomez, dear, would you like a little snack, some pâté de foie gras?
Crepes suzettes?
Gomez?
Friends, Romans, countrymen That's it!
Morticia, what happened?
It's even worse than you thought.
It all started when he began running for mayor.
Oh, dear, sweet, kind Gomez.
I've turned him into a Frankenstein.
There is a resemblance.
I can't interfere now.
Oh, yes, I can.
I forced him into this race and I'll force him out for his own good.
- How?
- I'll need some cooperation.
- You can count on me.
- Me, too.
Oh, dear, sweet Thing.
Not only do I accept the challenge of a television debate, but I refuse to sink to the level of this corrupt old windbag and engage in any name-calling.
Mama!
I'm sorry I can't stick around, son, but I'll never get these office floors scrubbed just sitting here on my bucket.
Well, I'm off to my job.
Job?
I didn't even know you had a mop.
Just one moment, madam.
Did I understand you to say that Gomez Addams is your son?
Sure, has been for years.
Oh, thank you.
If you bring it back I'll autograph it for you.
Well, gentlemen, did you hear that?
And this is the man who asks you to elect him to the high office of mayor of our fair city.
And who forces that old, gray-haired mother of his to scrub office floors.
What do you have to say to that, sir?
There's a perfectly simple explanation.
I just can't think of it.
Meaning, of course, that you are not going to help.
Of course I'm going to help her.
I'm going to get her a new mop.
That old one did look pretty scruffy.
Gomez, I just had to see you!
It has been hours, hasn't it?
I'm really touched.
Say, I like your new outfit.
Who's your tailor?
Never mind that.
I just wanted you to know you'd get my vote if I had one.
They'll never take me alive.
Who was that?
Oh, that's Uncle Fester, the family Beau Brummell.
Off to the races, from the looks of the outfit he was wearing.
I'm leaving that beast and no one can stop me.
- What happened?
- What happened?
You know what happened, you wife-beater.
And you gentlemen of the press, if you know your job, you'll splatter this all over the front pages.
And as for you, when the public finds out what a vile fiend you really are it'll be curtains for you.
The end.
Tish, that's French.
And when they find out that you're also a scoundrel and a cardsharp and a vain, self-centered, sweet, kind, beautiful And a vote for Gomez Addams is a vote for clean government!
Well, gentlemen, I hope you will give this story the treatment it deserves.
- We will.
And it'll be a landslide.
- Well, thank you.
An Addams landslide.
- Addams landslide?
- Get with it, Mayor.
This is the absolute tops in satire on dirty politics, mud-slinging and character assassination.
Addams is even getting my vote.
- What'll I do?
- Concede.
- What?
- You're all washed-up anyway.
There'll be other elections and the crowd loves a good loser.
A new political star has risen.
Gentlemen, I give you His Honor, Gomez Addams.
- Gomez?
- Yes.
- Do you really like this outfit?
- Oh, yes.
Not now, Uncle Fester.
Please, dear.
What were you saying?
Well, the people have spoken when they first rushed to sign that original petition.
- That's silly.
- What's silly?
Well, where we got those names from, no one was rushing or speaking.
Uncle Fester, where did you get those names?
The Happy Rest Cemetery.
Right off the headstones.
- Cemetery?
- Yeah.
Addams, I'm afraid that disqualifies you, old boy.
Better luck next time.
Oh, Gomez, darling, I'm dreadfully sorry.
I feel personally responsible for all of this.
Can you ever forgive me?
- I doubt it.
- Bubele.
So help me, if I live to be a thousand, I'll never, never forgive you.
What is it, darling?
I simply must know how I'd have fared as Mayor.
Statesmanship, leadership, initiative, intelligence and ability.
- Don't forget good looks, dear.
- Right, good looks.
Darling, is "impeachment" good?
"Chaos, mismanagement, corruption"?
Well, in that case, impeachment would be the best thing.
Who wants to be mayor of a bankrupt city?
You withdrew just in time, darling.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Nice try, Gomez darling.
Too good for you, huh, Lurch?
Darling, I don't think you ought to tire Lurch out.
You know how delicate he is.
You may be right, my dear.
He does look a bit spent.
Well, Lurch.
You had enough?
Give up?
Better luck next time, old man.
Oh, Gomez, darling, you were so masterful.
Delicious, like the nectar of saki.
Mail's in.
Yes, Thing.
What is it?
Oh, something at the door?
Oh, it's my surprise for Cousin Itt.
It's breathing.
Hey, is that for me?
No, Uncle Fester.
This is a welcome-home surprise for Cousin Itt.
Itt?
I thought he was in the South Seas.
He was, diving for sponges.
Very successfully, too.
The sponges thought he was one of them.
Give me a hand, Fester.
We have to get things ready for Cousin Itt's party.
Now that's what I like.
A package that delivers itself.
Cousin Itt, are you sure your eyes are closed?
- Good.
- All right, Lurch.
Now you can open your eyes, Cousin Itt.
- I knew you'd like it, old man.
- It's so you.
- They look like brothers.
- They do have a lot in common.
What are you gonna name him, Cousin Itt?
Which is the front end of Now I see.
Mother, I'm hungry.
Can we cut Cousin Itt's cake now?
Of course, darling.
I almost forgot about it.
Cousin Itt, would you do the honors?
Oh, of course.
Lurch, we'll need a chair.
You're welcome.
All right, now, Cousin.
Make a wish.
I've heard of rock candy, but rock cake?
Better try it again, dear.
Oh, boy!
That's my favorite, cauliflower meringue.
What is it, Lurch?
Is something wrong?
Hair.
Mother, look, there's hair on the chair, too.
Cousin Itt, you're losing your hair.
- He's right.
Without his hair, what is he?
- Nothing.
Absolutely nothing.
No, no, no.
Now, we will not have any of that do-it-away-with-yourself talk.
That is, of course, unless we can't find a cure for you.
Don't you worry.
I'm an old hand at curing baldness.
Cousin Itt, you're not leaving us?
But you must give Uncle Fester a chance.
But you're still very attractive.
Wouldn't a little vacation be a lot more sensible?
Now, Gomez and I have decided to give you a little extra money, say, $10,000.
You could have yourself a real fling.
Give it to charity?
Just as you say, but please stay.
Oh, I promise.
We'd never call you Baldy.
Dear, sweet, kind Cousin Itt.
You know, a person could really talk to you.
That's beautiful, my dear.
It's beautiful.
- What is it?
- It's a sweater for Cousin Itt.
If he's going to lose his hair, he has to have something to keep himself warm.
Did the money cheer him up?
He asked me to give it to the Society for the Prevention of Baldness.
- Never heard of it.
- Neither have I. But I asked Mrs. Dragwater to come over.
She's the head of the welfare society.
She'll see that it gets into the proper hands.
Dear, would that be Mrs. Dragwater already?
Good Good afternoon.
I have a package here, sir.
Could you get somebody to sign it for me, please?
Follow me.
- I didn't order anything, did you?
- Perhaps it's for Cousin Itt.
Is that my package?
Yes, it is.
It's my new chemistry set.
I'm working on something to save Cousin Itt's hair.
Well, will you sign for it?
Thing, take care of that.
Thanks.
Now, a little electricity.
Well, what do we have here?
I've done it!
Fester, you've done it!
The first nonskid banana peel.
Darling, I don't remember Aunt Anemia having a beard and a mustache.
A beard, maybe, but not a mustache.
It is becoming.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Thing, what's all this hair?
Gomez, come here and look, dear.
Curious.
First, Aunt Anemia, now this box.
This looks like a job for Sherlock Addams.
Thank you.
More hair.
Darling Gomez, you're so clever.
Elementary, cara mia, elementary.
- Singular.
- Very.
A doorknob with a Beatle hairdo.
- Well, what do you think?
- Uncle Fester, I hardly knew you.
- You're a knockout.
- I made it with my new chemistry set.
Have you tried the formula on Cousin Itt?
Well, don't you think that one handsome devil in the family is enough?
- Uncle Fester.
- Well, okay.
Cousin Itt!
It's true.
Blondes do have more fun.
Eureka!
Certainly, Cousin Itt.
Take a look.
By george, you do look like a haystack.
But you should be flattered.
Gomez doesn't hand out compliments like that to just everyone.
- And congratulations to you, Uncle Fester.
- Well, thank you, Morticia.
You know, this could be the start of a whole new career for me.
I could get a job at the zoo, growing hair on bald eagles.
Oh, dear, that reminds me.
That woman from the welfare society should be here any moment.
Woman?
Is she cute?
I don't know, but she is a divorcée.
Groovy.
Carinita, we'll turn over the money to her for openers, and throw in Uncle Fester's discovery as a little bonus.
Excellent idea, darling.
Oh, Gomez, would you make the cocktails?
You do them so well.
It's that extra sprig of henbane.
Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?
Boy!
Am I that handsome?
Wow!
Yes.
Mrs. Dragwater to see Mrs. Addams.
Follow me.
Mrs. Dragwater.
Oh, Mrs. Dragwater, so good of you to come.
My pleasure.
My husband's upstairs napping.
Won't you sit down?
I think I'd better.
Would you care for a cocktail?
I think I'd better.
You rang?
Cocktails, please, Lurch.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
Thank you, Lurch.
You may go.
Delicious, isn't it?
It's my husband's piece de résistance.
Creme de la toadstool.
Tish!
You spoke French.
Darling, later, later.
Mrs. Dragwater and I have a lot to discuss.
Pardon me.
So, now, where were we?
Well, first, I ought to tell you, the welfare board supports a lot of charities.
But we don't exactly have a Society for the Prevention of Baldness.
However Well, now, who's our charming guest?
Mrs. Dragwater, this is my Uncle Fester.
How do you do?
Excuse me.
Well, haven't we met before?
Such a delicate little hand.
And tasty, too.
Mrs. Addams, your uncle is so droll.
Yes, he does have that Continental manner, doesn't he?
With a beauty like you, who could be otherwise?
Now, really.
I know that Emily Post says to wait one week, but how about you and me stepping out tonight?
Skateboarding, water polo, a drive-in movie that's closed.
- Well - It's a date.
I'll borrow Mama's motor scooter.
You are a forceful one.
Experience, experience.
Well, I think I'll go up and pomade my hair.
If anybody wants me, I'll be in my room.
Tonight at 8:00.
Mrs - Mrs. Dragwater?
- Yes?
Mrs. Dragwater?
- Ready?
- Ready.
Do it again.
Querida, you have such a gentle, healing touch.
Was Mrs. Dragwater pleased with our offer?
Well, I don't know.
There she was, smiling and pleasant, and then all of a sudden, there she wasn't.
Those social workers have to keep on the move.
Morticia, look.
Oh, darling, she's lost her beard and mustache.
Too bad.
I liked her better that way.
- Gomez, the turtle.
- Great Scott!
- Did you hear that?
Cousin Itt.
- Cousin Itt.
Cousin Itt, what happened?
Gad, even your voice has changed!
Excuse me, old man.
- Itt, what happened?
- Have you lost your lovely new hair?
You mean, Uncle Fester's lotion was only temporary?
You weren't losing your hair?
By george, Morticia.
Cousin Itt's right.
It was the dog.
That's terrible.
Who ever heard of a bald dog?
Don't worry, dear.
If worse comes to worse, we'll get you a toupee.
Come in.
Uncle Fester lost his hair again.
How is he taking it?
Good old Fester, tower of strength.
Lurch, look out here, will you please Fester.
Watch out for that beam.
Now, he tells me.
- Uncle Fester, did you hurt yourself?
- Just my head.
This room is a deathtrap!
But it does give you a sense of togetherness.
Did I really lose my hair?
Well, I didn't misplace it.
Uncle Fester.
All you have to do is give yourself another treatment.
It'll only work once.
And my head is immune to it.
I'm gonna shoot myself.
Come, come, Fester.
Pull yourself together.
Thanks, Gomez.
I needed that.
Phone's ringing.
Lurch, answer the phone, please.
- The phone!
- Where's the phone?
Maybe it's under the bed.
Stop that bongo playing, will you?
We're looking for the phone.
I think he means it's under the drum.
Oh, yes.
Hello, Addams residence.
Yes, just a moment.
It's for you, Uncle Fester.
Mrs. Dragwater.
I'm gonna shoot myself.
You better talk to her first.
Not without my hair.
I'm not in.
I'm not in!
Mrs. Dragwater, Uncle Fester is out.
I'll take a message.
Yes.
Yes.
Oh, of course.
Really?
Yes, I will.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
I know she called the date off.
Now, now, Uncle Fester, she merely called to explain that she was afraid sooner or later she'd lose a Don Juan like you to some other woman.
Did she call me a Don Juan?
What else, you sly old fox?
How true.
Mrs. Dragwater averted heartbreak by going back to her husband.
Her husband?
Rover T. Dragwater?
I know him.
He's fat, bald, and has a high, squeaky voice.
- Well, if that's her taste - So it all worked out for the best.
- Let's celebrate.
- No, I'm too broken up.
Even for a midnight picnic?
In the swamp?
Afterwards, if we have time, we could go moonbathing.
Moonbathing!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Everybody watch that beam.
And the door.
Ah, what a perfect night for moonbathing.
By george, what a beautiful moon.
Not a sign of life.
Nothing but solid rock.
Gomez, that's Uncle Fester's head.
It is?
- What's it doing up in the sky?
- Gomez!
Pardon.
No wonder it looked like a rock.
This spray is no good.
It doesn't attract any insects.
Don't worry, Cousin Itt will bring them around.
Hey, Itt, you're doing pretty good with that balancing act.
He should.
He's been taking lessons from Pugsley's seal.
It pays.
Glad you got over your hair problem, Cousin Itt.
I'm sorry your dog still has it.
Dog?
Oh, that reminds me, Cousin Itt.
Where is your dog?
Your dog eloped?
With Mrs. Dragwater?
With her dog.
Oh, isn't that lovely?
Eloped with a Mexican hairless.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
There, darling, I think it's sharp enough now.
Lovely, Morticia, querida mía.
Hurry up, Gomez.
Are you getting tired, Uncle Fester?
No.
I like to pose, it's so artistic.
Good.
I want to get the inner you.
- Not with that!
- That's just for carving.
That's what I'm afraid of!
Not for carving you, for carving your likeness.
Let's have the real, the true, the unadorned you.
Beautiful.
Now, for immortality.
Don't move, don't look, don't even breathe.
- Don't worry - Don't.
That's it.
Hold it.
By Jove, I think I've done it.
Why, Gomez, you're the Michelangelo of Halloween pumpkins.
How do you like it so far?
Darling, you have the soul of an artist, and the touch of a surgeon.
And now for the Halloween festivities.
Are you both ready?
- Ready on the right.
- Ready on the left.
Good.
Now, when I count three and fire the pistol, it's every man for himself.
All right?
One, two, three!
Remember, the first one to get an apple in his mouth wins the Halloween prize.
Oh, dear.
There's the doorbell.
I'll get it.
Uncle Fester, I can't understand a word you're saying.
What I was trying to say was I was drowning!
Well, it was worth it.
You won the prize.
Oh, goody!
What do I get?
This.
What kind of a prize is that?
Well, I had planned it for Gomez.
I did so think he was going to win.
It was just Pugsley and Wednesday rehearsing their trick-or-treat approach.
Oh, dear.
They're already out there with their little bags, and we have nothing for the other children.
- I could give them each a walrus tusk.
- But darling, it's Halloween.
Two walrus tusks?
No, no, no, dear.
They want little goodies.
Perfect!
Bite-sized salamander sandwiches.
Make a couple of hundred, Lurch.
We're going to have a lot of trick-or-treaters tonight.
Mama, how's the porcupine taffy coming?
About done.
Just have to add a few more quills.
And the punch, Uncle Fester?
There she blows!
Well, we're almost ready for the little trick-or-treaters.
When's the last time any of them came to our house?
Eight years ago, but I do want to be ready.
Why, Wednesday, I didn't expect you until the morning.
Nobody home in the neighborhood?
I told her to wear a nice ghost getup.
You probably scared people to death with that horrible costume.
I didn't scare anyone.
Pugsley's still out trying.
What's wrong?
Didn't you have a good time?
I had lots of fun.
Oh, darling.
What's this?
Tears on our very own holiday?
Why, all those nice witches and goblins flying around.
That's just it.
They told us there weren't any witches.
What?
What fiend uttered that vile canard?
Mr. Thompson, across the street.
- What a terrible thing to tell a child.
- He should be horsewhipped.
If I were a horse, I'd whip him.
Well, I guess I'd better go up to bed.
If you can't believe in witches, what can you believe in?
- Oh, Gomez.
- Poor little Wednesday.
One careless remark and the child's ideals are crushed.
Gomez, I think you ought to call that Mr. Thompson - and tell him just what his lies have done.
- Excellent idea.
I still think he ought to be horsewhipped.
I'll get a horse.
Uncle Fester, you do not make friends by whipping people.
You're right, my dear.
We must be civilized about these things.
I'll reason with him.
Thompson, you lying scoundrel!
What are these vile canards that you've been telling my children?
What is he saying, dear?
He doesn't know what a "vile canard" means.
How uncouth!
Well, Thompson, what I mean is, what's the big idea of telling my children there are no witches?
Really?
You don't say.
Well, that's an interesting point of view.
Goodbye.
- Well, darling, did he apologize?
- Not exactly.
He called me a nut.
Morticia, there are witches, aren't there?
Oh, of course there are, darling.
Remember our Great-Great-Great-Aunt Singe?
She was burned at Salem.
Come here, dear.
These are her ashes.
That's Aunt Singe, all right.
She still looks pretty good, too.
Well, that settles it.
We can't take this lying down.
We have to prove to that little girl that witches do exist.
If we could only get one witch to sit down and explain things to her.
Cara mia, that's a big order.
Where can we find a witch like that?
- In the classifieds.
- Right, just look under "W".
No witches?
Maybe their telephone numbers are unlisted.
Oh, no, here, darling.
Look.
Querida, that's witch hazel.
Oh, so it is.
Well, perhaps we'd better advertise.
Good thinking.
"Witch wanted, no questions asked".
- It won't work.
- Why not?
Want ads closed two hours ago.
Gomez, I have a truly inspirational idea.
- A second honeymoon?
- No, darling.
If we want a witch, why don't we call on our own Aunt Singe?
Won't that be a bit inconvenient?
In the spirit, darling.
We'll hold a séance.
Oh, I love séances.
Last time I talked to my dear departed brother, Clump.
Did he answer?
No, that's how I knew it was my brother, Clump.
He was a quiet one.
Then it's all settled.
We'll hold a séance tonight, and throw ourselves on Aunt Singe's mercy.
- You think she'll answer?
- Well, of course!
What right-thinking witch would turn down a child on Halloween?
I always forget I frighten you.
On Halloween.
Sorry.
Forgive me, Thing.
Lurch, this is an emergency.
What are you doing tonight?
The movies.
- Alone?
- With Thing.
Forget it.
Tonight, you've got to stay here and help me.
Well, you've got to.
Imagine that Morticia and Gomez, thinking they can get a witch to pop up on an hour's notice.
Especially on Halloween, the busiest night in the year.
Do you realize how disappointed those children will be?
I'm glad you feel that way, Lurch.
So Tonight, you are a witch.
Well, now, we're almost ready.
Oh, dear, did you alert Cousin Cackle in his cave?
He's on his way over, darling.
Cousin Cackle.
Good of you to come, Cousin.
Same old gabby Cackle!
Oh, Cousin Cackle, how good to hear your voice.
You know, since you moved out to the cave, the attic just hasn't been the same.
Why, of course, you may sit down.
Right over here, Cousin.
Sit down and make yourself comfortable.
Now, let's see.
Are we all here?
Oh, yes, all except Pugsley.
He's still out tricking and treating.
Oh, why, of course, Thing, we wouldn't dream of starting without you.
At a séance, every hand counts!
Now, we shall try to contact Aunt Singe.
Lurch!
Thank you, Lurch.
- We'll need a serpent's tooth.
- Coming up.
- It was loose anyway.
- Thank you, darling.
Now Now, we should really have the jawbone of an ass.
Don't look at me.
Jawbone.
Oh, thank you, Lurch.
You think of everything.
Now, please put out the lights and bring me a candle.
Thank you, Lurch.
You may go.
Now, everybody hold hands and concentrate.
O noble spirits in your lofty sphere, look down upon this small ensemble.
Ensemble.
That's French.
Darling, please!
I was trying to contact Aunt Singe.
Sorry, Aunty.
Take hands again and concentrate.
Oh, fire of Salem.
Oh, flame of Satan.
Come in, Aunt Singe, we're all awaitin'.
Come in, Aunt Singe.
Come in, Aunt Singe.
Please come in.
You called.
By george, she answered!
She may be cinders, but she's a lady.
Hey, how do we really know it is Aunt Singe?
Of course it's her.
I'll show you.
Hello, out there.
If that's you, Aunt Singe, knock three times and whistle twice.
If it isn't, whistle once and knock twice.
Wait, you'd better make that four knocks and two whistles, if you are and one short whistle and three long knocks, if you're not.
This is Aunt Singe.
There.
Aunt Singe, would you please say something to Wednesday?
Hello, Wednesday.
Please, come see us.
Please!
Just once.
Well All right.
Goody!
We'll wait up for you.
Morticia, you've done it.
How could she resist such a loving invitation?
You You rang?
Yes, Lurch.
Put some hot coals in the guest room.
Aunt Singe is coming.
Welcome, Aunt Singe!
Oh, cara.
- I hope Aunt Singe likes children.
- Oh, all witches love children.
Remember Hansel and Gretel?
They almost wound up in an oven, but until then, that old witch couldn't have been nicer.
Couldn't possibly.
And then she wound up in the oven.
Some children are so unappreciative.
I hope Aunt Singe doesn't disappoint Wednesday.
I asked you to be a voice, not make a personal appearance.
Now where am I gonna find a witch?
Hiring hall?
I guess I'll just have to go out and see what's flying around.
Darling, am I disturbing your thoughts?
No, querida, that's my favorite song.
Gomez.
I was playing It's a Long, Long Way to Tipperary.
- Well, then that's my favorite song.
- You are an angel.
And a worried one.
What if Aunt Singe doesn't appear tonight?
- Little Wednesday will be heartbroken.
- Oh, dear, that's true.
Maybe we should buy her a nice gift, just in case.
Capital idea.
What will it be?
Well, you know how fond children are of pets.
A new pet, perfect.
I'll have Lurch get my hat.
I think the bell's out of order.
No problem.
- You rang?
- My hat and cane, Lurch.
Thank you.
Problem is solved.
Such dash, such style, such savoir-faire.
Tish, you spoke French.
Darling, please!
The pet.
Yes.
I'll be back in half an hour on this watch.
Twenty minutes on this one.
- Yes, Lurch, what is it?
- Mr. Addams.
Back so soon?
Wants you to close your eyes.
Ah, yes.
A surprise.
Dear Wednesday will be so thrilled.
Very well, my love.
Open your eyes.
Gomez!
What a lovely gift.
A yak.
Darling, that's a horse.
It is?
There is a resemblance.
Resemblance?
Look at these blue ribbons.
Oh, he won them?
I bought them.
Thought they'd look nice on him.
They will, darling, they will.
Now, let's see, what shall we name him?
How about Fido?
Fido?
For a horse?
- Rover?
- Much better.
- Ever see such lines on an animal?
- Never.
He's highly trained, too.
Watch.
All right, now, Rover.
Ten-hut!
Ever see a quicker, more intelligent animal?
- He's almost human.
- He counts, too.
Watch.
All right, Rover, how many fingers?
He hates to show off.
I'll make it a little easier for you.
How many now?
By george, he guessed it.
Well, Aunt Singe.
Uncle Fester, does that look like Aunt Singe?
- You mean, it isn't?
- It's a horse.
Are you sure?
Not only a beautiful animal, but smart, too.
He can count to ten.
Big deal.
I can count to 20.
- The horse didn't go to school.
- Neither did I. Good point.
Oh, hello, Wednesday darling.
Come and see the new pet we have for you.
Do you like him?
He's very nice, but I'd rather have a spider.
A spider or a horse, darling, what's the difference?
But I'd rather have a spider.
All right, a spider it is.
A beautiful black widow spider.
- Back goes Rover.
Sorry, old man.
- No!
I'll take him, and if I hear any more subversive talk from our neighbor, Thompson Horsewhip!
Come on, Rover.
It's your turn, dear.
Here's the list.
You and your silly friends and their silly Halloween scavenger hunt.
But, Penelope, it's all part of the Halloween fun.
Fun, my foot.
But at least it got us out of the house, so I didn't have to face those pesky little trick-or-treaters.
Darling, you look just fine in your witch's costume.
It fits you perfectly.
- What?
- I mean the size is right.
How much longer do you intend to keep up this nonsense?
Just till we get the three last items.
Now, you try this house, and I'll try the next one.
Halloween!
The ridiculous things people do on Halloween!
- Look, I'm - I know.
Mama sent you.
Nobody sent me.
Then you must be Follow me.
Visitor from spirit world.
By george, you made it.
Welcome to our humble, earthly abode.
Well, have you people been on a scavenger hunt.
Could you spare a few things?
I've got to find three items.
Would you have a Louisville bat, black?
Gomez, darling, do they come in any other colors?
From Louisville, I don't know.
But we can get you some hometown black bats from the attic.
Good evening, Aunt Singe.
Aunt Singe?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You must have mistaken me for someone else.
Oh, no, no, no, we didn't.
That's an Addams face if I ever saw one.
Look at that chin, dear.
- Flabby, weak, receding.
- Beautiful.
Aunty, and here's a broom, and if you could do a few quick turns around the room, I'm sure Wednesday would appreciate it.
Turns?
- The bats.
- Live bats!
Why didn't somebody tell me Aunt Singe was here?
I was just catching a little snooze, up in my tree.
Did you say up in your Oh, isn't that sweet.
Even Kitty cat's come down to welcome you.
The emotional reunion must have been too much for her.
Well, that's the way it goes on Halloween.
You have to keep on the move.
Oh, I'm so glad she kept her promise, and I'm very happy she's using our broom.
Listen everybody, I've got bad news.
Aunt Singe isn't coming.
- Oh?
- Isn't coming?
No, I just left her, and she said to tell you she's sorry, but on account of the big Halloween rush But, Mama, Aunt Singe was just here.
She was?
Oh, yes, and whatever she told you about the holiday rush is quite true.
Why, she flew right out the window.
Yes, she even forgot her hat.
Beautiful.
We ought to do this every day!
Oh, dear, there's the doorbell.
I'll get it.
What is it, darling?
It's a note from our neighbor, Mr. Thompson.
Oh, what does he say?
Well, he says he apologizes for calling me a nut.
He's now convinced there are witches, and in fact he's threatening to call the police unless we get that witch off our roof.
There's a witch on our roof?
- What's up?
- There's a witch on our roof.
There's nothing of the kind.
- How do you know?
- I was just up there.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
My dear, the hot coals are ready.
Uncle Fester, are you ready?
Well Make sure they're good and hot.
Thank you, Lurch.
Good man.
Uncle Fester, are you sure you want to go through with this?
Well You said you'd go through fire for me, old man.
But not in my bare feet.
It's nothing to fear.
Purely a question of mind over matter.
Well, in that case Oh, this is hot!
- Bravo, bravo!
- By golly, you did it!
- After only one lesson of Zen-Yogi.
- Yeah.
Oh, darling, with such an inspired instructor as you, anything is possible.
While they're still hot, I might as well take a stroll through myself.
Nothing to it, once you've mastered concentration.
How true, darling, how true.
But next time, why don't you try it with your shoes off?
A mere technicality.
You're spoiling me, Morticia.
An Indian for each length.
Well, darling, you've always said I was an Indian giver.
Now I've proved it.
Good cigar.
- Hello, Father.
- Children, home from Where are you home from?
Oh, yes, you're home from school.
How are things down at the old brain factory?
- Are you sure you wanna know?
- Certainly.
We're your parents.
- Aren't we?
- Of course we are, darling.
Look at the family resemblance.
Now, what seems to be the difficulty?
A little problem in trigonometry?
Calculus?
Nuclear fission?
Anything I can't handle, your mother can.
- It's not that at all.
- It's these books they make us read.
Oh, I do hope they're not teaching you about the birds and the bees?
Yes, plenty of time for that later.
On the other hand Gomez!
Run along, children.
Oh, darling, it's even worse than we thought.
Look at this.
The Wicked Goblin.
That's ridiculous.
I never met a goblin I didn't like.
Oh, dear, I don't think I can even bear to read the title of this one.
You must.
If the children can stand it, so can I. How Sir Lancelot Slew the Evil Giant.
It's outrageous.
Who ever heard of an evil giant?
Of course, a giant is simply an oversized pygmy.
Read the title of the other one.
Oh, dear.
How Pamela Escaped from the Wicked Witch.
Oh, I wish I hadn't asked.
Imagine, poisoning a child's mind with all this terrible literature.
- Children, have you protested?
- Sure.
We told Miss Doubleday that us Addamses like giants, goblins and witches.
But she just muttered something about nuts.
"Nuts"?
That does it.
We'll march to the board of education.
We'll picket the PTA.
Darling, we've complained before.
It doesn't do any good.
The abuses just continue.
What can we do?
Besides, the poor educators are probably doing the best they can.
If they had better books, I'm sure they'd use them.
- Probably.
- The point is, - someone has to write them.
- But who?
You?
Oh, no, I couldn't.
But then again, why not?
With your busy schedule, you'd dedicate yourself to the task of creating a new literature for children?
Darling, this is very important.
It must be done.
What a sacrifice!
This is a red-letter day for book-Iovers.
You have to work down here in the cave?
The closest thing we have to a Ionely garret.
Then why not use the garret?
Lurch likes to use it for his clay-modeling.
Darling, why don't you turn off the echo?
Thing.
Thank you, Thing.
Now then, I'll just bring in a cot, and sleep over there.
Oh, no, darling, you'll interfere with my work.
That's the idea.
All work and no play All work and no play gets books done.
- But you'll need literary advice.
- I'll ask Cousin Cackle.
You see?
He's just dying to give advice.
Cackle's been in this cave for 30 years.
What does he know about the world?
Darling, a man who's lived in a cave for 30 years certainly has had a lot of time to think.
Well, I guess the first thing I'll need is a title.
Why, thank you, Thing.
That's a lovely title.
The Good Giant Slays Wicked Sir Lancelot.
Thank you.
- Will I see you at dinner?
- Oh, I doubt it, dear.
I'll probably just munch some jimsonweed, and work right through the night.
Well, in that case - Aloha.
- Aloha, bubele.
- You know what that name does to me.
- Darling, please.
Book, now.
Bubele, later.
Sorry.
This is how Louisa May Alcott must have looked, when she started Little Women.
Well, I've started.
Only 300 more pages to go.
- We've cleared out at least three shelves.
- Aren't you going a bit overboard?
- Morticia's only started her first book.
- You have to look ahead.
Once Morticia gets rolling, we'll have to clear out every shelf in the house.
- Dickens, too?
- I'm afraid so, Lurch.
- Everyone has to do his part.
- How long has Morticia been on this?
Exactly two days, But every one, well worth it.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
I can see it all now.
"Morticia Addams, the new literary sensation".
Traveling all over the world, drinking it up at those literary teas.
Making speeches, signing autographs, telling off the critics.
We might not even see her for six months at a time.
- Six months?
- Oh, maybe even six years.
But as long as it's for humanity, - who cares?
- I care.
- Lf the girl travels, I'm going with her.
- You can't do that.
Somebody's gotta stay at home and take care of the kids.
- What about you?
- Oh, I can take care of myself.
- Can't you look after the children?
- Sorry, I'll be too busy answering Morticia's fan letters.
And besides, they're your kids.
Gadzooks!
I may have created a Frankenstein.
The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.
Morticia.
- Querida, I must talk to you.
- Oh, of course, that's it.
That's what comes next.
"The "End".
Thank you so much, Thing.
My fingers were getting numb.
Oh, darling, you're just in time.
My first book, all ready for publication.
- Wonderful.
- And just think, it only took me two days, 10 hours and Don't you realize we've hardly had a word together for days?
Well, let's talk now, dear.
I'm taking a 10-minute break between books.
In that case, let's not waste a second.
Gomez, darling, don't you want to talk about my book?
Oh, yes.
The book.
My first story, Cinderella the Teenage Delinquent.
Cinderella My blood boils when I think of that little minx.
Gomez, can you imagine?
Those two Good Samaritans take her in off the street, and what does she do?
The night they need her the most, she runs off in a pumpkin.
- How did you right that wrong?
- Simple.
Here.
"As the clock struck 12:00, the police summoned by the kindly stepmother "found Cinderella cowering in the ashes, with a stolen glass slipper, "and yanked her off to the pokey".
Cara mia!
You've done it.
This'll open the eyes of school librarians everywhere.
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.
Your 10 minutes are up.
Back to work.
Dear, would you please proofread that and send it off to a publisher?
- Which one?
- Try Demon Press.
They sound just perfect for children's books.
Thank you, Thing.
Thanks again, Thing.
What's the matter, Gomez?
Fester, you've caught me on the horns of a dilemma.
Well, why don't you hop off of it, and just tell me all about it?
I'm supposed to mail this manuscript to Morticia's publisher, but I don't dare.
- It's that bad, huh?
- It's that good.
Once he sees this, I've lost her forever.
There'll be nothing but abject misery for both of us and the children.
- So just don't mail it.
- I can't do that, she trusts me.
- That makes it easier.
- Out of the question.
- I got a better idea.
- What's that?
Why don't you just change it a little bit, so the publisher won't like it?
Tamper with this masterpiece?
Fester, that's like asking me to put a mustache on the Mona Lisa.
Or put plastic arms on Venus.
Or finger-paint on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel.
- Okay, it was just a suggestion.
- And a great one.
I'll do it.
A more miserable man never roamed this earth.
You can be miserable, all right.
But for now, will you relax?
- How can I?
- Please.
I'll try.
Much better.
It's no use, Fester.
Even Zen-Yogi doesn't help.
I'm a seething volcano inside.
All you're doing is changing a few of Morticia's words, just enough so the publisher will turn it down, and you've got your wife back.
But at what price?
How can a man of honor tamper with her beautiful lines?
Who needs a man of honor?
You do it.
Well, better to preserve a marriage than a masterpiece.
I'll dictate the changes, you write them down.
Okay, take it from the top.
"Out of the sweet-scented swamp, Lucifer, the kindly wolf, minced dandily".
All right, change that to "Across a daisy-covered meadow, "the snarling, sniveling, slathering wolf slunk".
That's great.
- But isn't that "slank"?
- No, I think it's "slinked".
- How about "slunk"?
- Very well, make it "slunk".
- I can't go on.
- You've got to.
You convinced me.
Ah, thank you, Thing.
I don't know what I would have done without you.
- I better sharpen this quill.
- All right.
Boy, they're not making quills like they used to.
I feel so guilty, being away from my writing.
You've got to relax.
If Keats had had a ping-pong table he'd have lived longer.
How can I relax?
It's been three days and no word from my publisher.
Don't worry, the rejection slip ought to be here any minute.
Rejection slip?
Gomez, what does he mean?
Querida, we must be realistic.
Genius often goes unrecognized.
After all, Dostoyevsky wasn't discovered until he was 56.
No wonder.
With a name like that, the reviewers probably couldn't even spell it.
Whose point was that, Fester?
- Who could that be?
- Oh, wouldn't it be lovely if it was my publisher, telling me he was going to print my book?
You writers, you live in a dream world.
Mr. Boswell, publisher.
For a minute there, I thought you said Mr. Boswell?
Publisher?
Morticia Addams.
Let me look at you.
- Incredible.
- How do you do?
Look, Boswell, if you're here with a rejection slip, be quick about it and on your way.
Rejection slip?
Really, my dear fellow!
Why, this little lady is a genius.
And I'm here to publish her work.
What do you have to say to that, Mrs. Addams?
Thank you.
Now, as to the finances, at present we're a little tight with working capital.
However, if you could see fit to put up, let's say, $5,000, I'll publish your book, and we'll make a fortune.
That sounds intriguing.
Just as I thought, a bunko artist, out for the money.
- I'll shoot him in the back.
- I've got a better idea.
- In the front?
- Boswell.
I've decided to accept your offer, but we'll make it $10,000 - and use a higher-grade paper.
- You better let me shoot him in the back.
- It's much cheaper.
- No.
- 10,000.
- This is most generous of you.
Without my husband's help, none of this would be possible.
You can say that again.
- I've got to get the presses rolling.
- I'll see you out.
I suppose you'll want some snapshots and some biographical notes?
Just the snapshots.
Let's forget the biographical notes.
- You gave that faker 10,000 bucks?
- And with good reason.
With that much, the scoundrel will skip to Brazil - and that'll be the end of it.
- And to think, some people call you a nut.
No wonder!
Please, I'm too upset!
In-laws.
Lunch.
Oh, Lurch.
Just in time.
Yes, midnight.
- Did Mr. Addams go to bed?
- Sound asleep.
Tish, you spoke French!
Darling, now, now, now.
You repose while I compose, dear.
Lurch, a very interesting technical question has arisen.
And both Thing and Cousin Cackle seemed a little vague about it.
Yes?
What was the name of that mean little girl, who was so beastly to those three lovely bears?
Goldilocks.
Ah, yes.
Goldilocks.
Trust a blonde to bring on trouble.
Well, when I get through with Miss Goldilocks, her books will be banned from coast to coast.
Oh, Lurch, Mr. Addams didn't quite make it.
Would you tuck him in, please?
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
Hey, Gomez, grab your motorcycle.
I'll race you to the attic.
Fester, my wife's been in that cave for three weeks and you want me to go hill-climbing?
- Can you think of anything better to do?
- My poor querida.
Slaving away on book eight, for what?
For some phony publisher living it up in Rio.
I got a hunch he didn't go to Rio.
I think he went to Europe.
- What difference does it make?
- Well, it costs a lot less in Europe.
- He might bring you back some change.
- I don't care about the money.
- I must tell Morticia the truth.
- About Boswell?
About my tampering with her book.
Well, I'm certainly glad that I didn't have anything to do with that.
Well, here it is, Gomez, darling.
Book number eight.
And not a word from Mr. Boswell about book number one.
Tish, are books all you can think about?
For a dedicated authoress, dear, what else is there?
- There's me.
- Oh, you're right.
- My next book will be about you.
- Morticia, there's something I must tell you.
- You'll never hear from Mr. Boswell again.
- Oh?
- Hey, who do you think's coming in?
- Cousin Turncoat?
No, Mr. Boswell.
Come in, come in.
Folks, this is a great day for American literature.
You're going back to Brazil?
No, dear, I believe Mr. Boswell means he brought us some good news?
- Did you bring us some change?
- Some change indeed.
$2,000 worth, as an advance to Mrs. Addams.
And there'll be many thousands more, when the book hits the bestseller lists.
- You mean you printed it?
- In genuine pebbled calfskin.
Egad!
The man's more cunning than I thought.
He's after more money.
Gomez, just think, my work on the same shelves with - Plato, Shakespeare and Aristophanes.
- Even Mickey Spillane.
The advance sale has been tremendous.
Schools are ordering books like hotcakes.
You're sure you don't mean ordering hotcakes like books?
Mrs. Addams, here is a contract for your next 10 books.
Read it, sign it, get it back to me, and we're in business.
- Thank you.
- Well, toodle-oo.
I never figured him for a toodle-ooer.
Gomez, what perfidy is this?
Is something wrong, my dear?
Wrong?
Listen to this title.
A Treasury of Mean Witches, Evil Giants and Wicked Goblins, - and Other Bedtime Stories.
- The censors'll never pass that.
And listen to this!
"Across the daisy-covered meadow, "the snarling, sniveling, slavering wolf slunk".
- "Slinked"?
- I felt that it should have been "slank".
Slinked, slanked or slunked!
That treacherous Mr. Boswell and his hired assassins have ruined my work.
- The cad!
- I'll shoot him in the back.
- No, Fester, we can't go that far.
- One bullet each?
No, there will be no shooting.
I have the soul of an artist, and I will not sell it for mere money.
- Querida!
You've given up writing.
- For the time being.
- The world isn't ready for good literature.
- How true.
The world isn't ready for you.
But I'm more than ready.
Tish Next time you write a book, write it in French.
- Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.
- Children.
- Hello, darlings.
- Look at these books they gave us to read in school.
A Treasury of Mean Witches, Evil Giants, Wicked Goblins and Other Bedtime Stories by Morticia Addams.
Mother, how could you?
Children, please, watch your language.
Besides, your mother didn't write those, I did.
Gomez, you?
Children, please go play with your spiders.
Cara, much as it hurt to rewrite those glorious phrases of yours, I had to do it.
- And I know why.
- You do?
You wanted to prove that the only thing that publishers will print today is junk.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
- It must be for me.
- It is for you, Uncle Fester.
- It's from my publisher.
- Publisher?
Yeah, I wrote a book.
Forever Fester.
And this fellow accepted it.
And I only had to give him $5,000.
And he didn't run off to Brazil or Europe, either.
He skipped to Australia.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
We're off!
Morticia, why are you sitting there?
I'm all dressed.
Lurch is waiting outside in the car.
We're all set.
- We are?
- But this is the night we look forward to all year.
The night the bats come back to Capistrano.
- Give them my regards.
- Dear, this is our great fun night.
- Listen.
- Fun, fun, fun.
- There's more to life than just fun.
- There is?
A person must contribute something to the world.
I contribute plenty.
Have you seen my tax bills?
Darling, you don't understand.
I want to do something creative.
My dear, you are creative.
You are a creative mother, a creative cook.
- And above all, a creative lover.
- Pish-tosh.
What does that all add up to?
I'll tell you what it all adds up to.
It adds up to la dolce vita.
Not bad, eh?
Gomez, listen to me, a life must have some fulfillment.
I want to do something artistic, that the world will remember.
Life is not all lovely thorns and singing vultures, you know.
You could develop a new strain of henbane, like Luther Burbank.
Take some grapes and cross them with poison oak.
No, darling, I'm tired of breeding plants.
Look, I crossed daffodils with roses, and what did I get?
- More petals.
- Dress designer.
No one knows more about fashion than you, my dear.
Oh, sweet Gomez.
But am I not more than merely a seamstress?
Yes, it should be something big, like Madame Curie, Louis Pasteur, Bluebeard, Michelangelo.
Michelangelo, that's it.
He was a painter, and then a sculptor.
- I am a painter, and now - That's right!
- All you need is a hammer and chisel.
- And a rock.
- Oh, I can hardly wait to get started.
- Neither can I. Ready?
Lurch?
Right this way, Lurch.
Good man.
Good Careful on the steps.
That's it.
Right over here, now.
Don't drop it or Mrs. Addams will have her studio in the basement.
There we are.
Thank you, Lurch.
Fester, have you got the hammer and chisel?
Here they are, but it's only a loan.
I need them for my correspondence course.
- Correspondence course?
In what?
- Brain surgery.
Where is the discus?
Thank you, Thing.
Ready, querida.
Oh, it's gorgeous.
Rock, rock, beautiful rock.
I got it for you myself, knowing that only you could do justice to it.
I think I'll do an abstract.
Well, then we'll get Cousin Vague to pose for you.
He's about as abstract as you can get.
Oh, no, darling.
For an abstract, I'm going to do it right out of my own little head.
- Now, sponge.
- Sponge.
- Hammer.
- Hammer.
- Chisel.
- Chisel.
Already, I feel like a different woman.
By george, Morticia, what wonders you've accomplished in a short three months.
It does have a certain je ne sais quoi.
Tish, that's French.
You know it drives me wild.
Darling, you almost made me ruin my masterpiece.
Oh, sorry.
Now, then.
I'm right in the middle of that left eye.
Perfect!
No, that was the whole eye.
Luckily, he has three.
Come and get it.
Lunch break.
- When are you gonna start?
- Start?
- Uncle Fester, I'm almost finished.
- Fester, don't be a clod.
- Don't you know art when you see it?
- I know a rock when I see it.
Oh, it was ever thus.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
- Perhaps you're standing too close.
- Yes, why don't you back up a bit.
How's it now?
- Well?
- Well Hey, from here it looks great.
Well, darling, what do you think?
Leonardo da Vinci never did anything like that.
Oh, I wonder what Mr. Bosley Swain will say.
Being the city's leading art critic, what else can he say, but Just a moment, Bosley.
If you have any suggestions, speak up.
Well, as a matter of fact, I do have a suggestion.
Bore a hole in it, put in a few sticks of dynamite - and blow it sky-high.
- Is that your final word?
No, I have one more.
Goodbye.
Darling, what did Mr. Swain say?
He was too overcome with emotion to discuss it, but he did show a lot of feeling.
That's a most wonderful compliment.
My, you are a nervous one today.
Why don't you just tell Morticia she's a flop?
And break her fragile little heart?
What do you take me for, Fester?
A Rasputin?
We must convince her somehow that statue's a success.
Somebody must be interested enough to buy it.
All right, I'll buy it.
No, I haven't got a dime.
Why don't you buy it?
For a stupid suggestion, Fester, that's positively brilliant.
I'll hire some broken-down art-dealer to buy it.
I'll put up the money, Morticia will be delighted, the money goes back in the bank, and everybody's happy.
For a brilliant idea, that's pretty stupid.
Where're you gonna find an art dealer that's crummy enough to do a thing like that?
Simple, I'll hire Sam Picasso, the crummiest art dealer in America.
- Shapeless mess?
- Look deeper, that's an abstract.
That I have seen better abstract made by a chain gang.
I'm not asking you to criticize it, Picasso, just buy it.
Not even with your money.
Don't you understand?
I will not sell my soul.
There'll be a $200 fee.
At those prices I like a man with integrity.
I wish I knew one.
Now, there's your $200.
Plus $50,000 to buy the statue.
You keep all of your money in the drawer?
Just petty cash.
Big stuff's upstairs in the mattress.
Mr. Picasso, my husband's been telling me about you.
That's a lie.
I run an honest gallery.
My dear, Mr. Picasso was just telling me how much he likes your statue.
Oh?
Ah, yes, "A thing of beauty is a joy forever".
That's Keats.
Now tell me, how much do you like my statue?
Picasso, start with a reasonable offer, or the deal's off.
That's an idea.
Come back here and face this like a man.
My dear, Mr. Picasso has just had a change of heart.
He remembers he has a rich buyer.
Undoubtedly a man of exquisite taste.
All right, let's get it settled.
All right, $50,000?
That's a nice round figure.
- It's a steal.
- Petty larceny.
- Your money, senora.
- Thank you.
Please excuse me.
- What's going on in here?
- Morticia just sold her statue.
- Well, how about that?
- Yes, and now I'll have to name it.
Let's see I think I'll call it Miracle of the Ages.
Like from the Stone Ages.
Well, I'll take the $50,000, my dear.
That mattress could use a little stuffing.
Oh, no, darling, I earned this money with my own hands.
And I'm going to use it to help aspiring artists like myself.
Morticia, that's ridiculous!
I mean, you're not gonna give them $50,000?
Why, of course not.
This is just the first installment.
From now on, every penny I make goes to help starving art students.
Darling.
What are you gonna do now, moneybags?
What any level-headed man would do.
Shoot myself.
Clatsworthy, you're my business manager.
Of course you can speak freely.
Well, not that freely.
So my bank account's overdrawn.
Who cares?
It makes my wife happy.
It makes the bank unhappy?
I'll just have to raise some more cash.
But I'll tell you one thing, Clatsworthy.
I'm changing banks.
I don't like dealing with spoilsports.
I'll say one thing about Morticia, she's got drive and she's quite a chiseler.
Enough to drive me to bankruptcy.
I'm being forced to dispose of some of my most valuable assets.
My game preserve in Nairobi.
Bamboo plantation in Bali.
What hurts most of all, a savings and loan in Siberia.
You'd better call Blooker the broker and have him dispose of my Consolidated Fuzz.
You know, if you were smart, you'd hold on to your Consolidated Fuzz - and sell your AT&T.
- It's not just the prices she's getting from Picasso, it's the cost of all that rock.
What's that thing she's making in there now?
Can't you tell?
It's the head of a dinosaur.
- Or is it the foot?
- How many has she sold?
I've lost count.
You broke it.
- Mr. Picasso?
- Well, of course.
You were expecting some bum?
Follow me.
And if you will behave yourself, I might give you a very big tip.
Mr. Picasso.
You're just in time to view my latest work.
Senora, I can hardly wait.
I call it Motherhood.
Why not?
When this will be displayed, all the mothers in the world will be after you After it.
Oh, then you think it's worth something?
$30,000 if it's worth a nickel.
I just won't sell it for more than $2,000.
I have finished several others.
Then for this one I will give you $40,000.
Not a penny more than $3,000.
I call this My Afternoon of an Evening.
I couldn't bear to part with it for less than $45,000.
It's a bargain.
Those starving artists must be eating better than I am.
And this is my master masterpiece.
I call it World War II.
- $80,000?
- $75,000.
How about that?
You saved $5,000.
- Throw them in the truck with the others.
- Where are you taking them?
The Tip Top Quarry.
You know they pay me $30 a ton.
Those scoundrels!
I buy my rocks at Tip Top and they charge me $100 a ton.
But I return the rocks damaged.
Speaking of money, Senor Gomez, you know, I will be needing some, if you want me to buy more of the masterpieces.
- Can't you bargain a little?
- You want me to insult an artist?
- That's no artist, that's my wife.
- It's only money.
Well, Gomez, so far you're batting zero.
Never mind my batting average, it's my bank balance that's falling so fast.
- It's time I put an end to all this.
- You're gonna tell Morticia the truth?
Exactly.
But first I'm gonna tell her a few more lies.
- Do hurry, Lurch.
I must get back to work.
- Yes, Mrs. Addams.
You're a very good grinder, Lurch, almost as good as Mama.
Dear Mama.
Her great-great-great- grandmother sharpened guillotines.
Dear old Great-Great-Grandmother Slice.
The belle of the French Revolution.
Oh, Gomez, you're just in time.
May I, dear?
Anything.
- Well, back to work.
- Morticia, wait.
Wait?
When art is calling?
Well, you can't keep up this mad pace.
Look at yourself in the mirror.
Pale, wan, sunken-cheeked.
Yes, sculpting does agree with me.
Believe me, you're working yourself to death.
Well, then, my prices will go up.
Look at it another way.
You're flooding the market.
Darling, Mr. Picasso doesn't seem to think so.
He keeps paying bigger and bigger prices everyday.
Even he's going to run out of money sooner or later, and a lot sooner than later.
You worry too much, bubele.
- But the way things are going, I - Gomez, I called you bubele.
Oh, yes.
Still drives me wild.
Darling, chisel now.
Bubele later.
Lurch, have you ever been on relief?
Ruined?
No, not if we make you a one-armed thinker.
Just sort of put it behind your back.
Yes, that's much better.
Oh, dear.
May I?
Yes, that's much better.
Now, I just have to remove that piece of thumb from your chin.
I think I got a bit too much.
May I?
It just keeps improving.
Now, hold still while I give it the final touch.
Lurch, I think I've really hit on something.
Good night, Mrs. Addams.
Well, good night, Lurch.
We'll work on it again in the morning.
Morticia, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Wonderful.
- I still have four hours of nightlight left.
- But aren't you coming to bed?
Oh, darling, how can I sleep knowing that somewhere there's a stone uncut.
- How about a husband uncuddled?
- Noble Gomez.
It's not like you to think of yourself when I'm in the throes of creation.
But the whole house has changed!
We never dance anymore, or Well, dance, darling.
Go right ahead, dance to your heart's content.
Alone?
Querida Why don't you call Mama?
She's always ready for an old-fashioned cha-cha-cha.
With all these rocks around, there's not even room for a cha.
Darling, you're right.
I have been selfish.
- You mean you're gonna give up sculpting?
- Oh, nonsense.
Since I'm crowding you here, I'm going to find myself a lovely garret.
- A garret?
- Of course.
You can visit me on weekends.
Pugsley!
Wednesday!
Darling, your children are here to see you.
Hello, children.
Poor little things.
You haven't seen your mother in days, have you?
Sure we've seen her.
She's been right there chopping on those rocks.
How true.
You little youngsters, feeling Ionely and neglected, you've come to plead with your mother to come back to you.
No, we were just on our way to the kitchen.
Do you hear that?
Not only Ionely and neglected, but starving, too.
Starving?
Nonsense, darling, there's plenty of cold yak in the refrigerator.
Querida, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Oh, yes, cold yak might upset their stomachs.
Heat it up, dear.
Children, tell your mother what it's been like, the last few days without her.
- We've been having a ball.
- We've been staying up all night.
Oh?
Well, just make sure you sleep late in the morning.
Darling, they can't sleep late in the morning, they have to go to school.
- We haven't been to school in days.
- Do you hear that?
- They haven't been to school in days.
- But, Father, it's vacation.
Come on, Pugsley, let's go in the kitchen and finish the fudge.
Little darlings.
Fudge?
Gadzooks!
Is she going to sculpt in the kitchen, too?
Wednesday, Pugsley, what are you doing?
Will you look at what's cooking in that pot?
Chocolate-marshmallow fudge!
Where did you pick up that habit?
Children, what do you have to say for yourselves?
- We're sorry.
- Have you ever tried fudge?
- Don't be insolent.
- Off to bed, this minute.
Go on, scoot, scoot, scoot.
Go on.
Oh, Gomez, fudge.
I have been neglecting the children.
- From now on, I'm turning in my chisel.
- No!
No, don't try to talk me out of it.
My mind's made up.
I'm going back to the most important role a woman can have.
- Lover.
- Mother.
- Oh, that.
- And lover.
You rang?
Lurch, clear those rocks out of the living room.
We're going to dance till dawn!
- Do I hear music?
- Yes.
You know when I told you to call Blooker the broker and sell?
I thought you said buy.
Did I get you in a jam?
You certainly did, tax-wise.
That stock went up 50 points.
I made $600,000.
Wonderful.
Now I can buy back all my lovely statues.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Oh, don't stop, please, it's so soothing.
Darling, I've almost worn out the drill.
Sharpen it up.
Sharpen it up.
Now, dear, too much of a good thing Querida, please, you were just hitting a nerve.
Okay, now, just one more time.
I'm sorry to spoil your fun, but something's wrong with Pugsley.
He hasn't spoken a word since he came home from school.
Maybe he can't think of anything to say.
He's just lying there on his bed of nails, staring up at the ceiling.
Perhaps the poor little tyke is all tuckered out.
But he hasn't eaten anything.
- Pugsley, not eaten?
- No!
The poor dear looks miserable.
Well, he never was too attractive.
Pugsley, darling, tell your mother what's wrong.
- Would you rather tell your father?
- Or your uncle?
Oh, dear.
What do we do now?
We've run out of relatives.
I'm in love.
Pugsley in love.
Oh, my baby's growing up.
Don't worry, my dear.
Little Casanova is a chip off the old block.
I'll never forget my first crush.
She was a ravishing creature of eight.
But it didn't work out.
First time I kissed her, we locked braces.
Took the dentist two hours to pry us apart.
Good shot, querida.
It's depressing to see Pugsley so sad.
Ruining my game.
See what I mean?
I simply can't get Pugsley's problem off my mind.
Sad.
Gomez, please, have you forgotten completely about poor little Pugsley?
We must do something to cheer that boy up.
- How about a new toy?
- Splendid idea, my dear.
I'll take care of it.
You do that, darling.
You're so sensible and practical.
- Show me the boy who wouldn't like this.
- It's beautiful, darling.
- What is it?
- What is it?
Look.
Marvelous!
Not only constructive, but body-building.
- What?
- Not only Not only constructive, but body-building.
Darling, I might have known you'd get a practical gift like this.
May I try?
Oh!
This is marvelous.
- Pugsley will have a wonderful time.
- Time?
What's going on here?
- The new toy for Pugsley.
- What?
Pugsley's new toy.
Will you shut that thing off?
- New toy for Pugsley.
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Why?
Why?
- Why?
He's got one already.
Well, in that case, I'll have a nice talk with the boy.
That's a good idea.
Hey, this thing is contagious.
- I'll return this thing.
- No, I'll take it.
Boy, this thing really works!
What's the matter, darling, can't you sleep?
I know, how about if I read you a nice ghost story?
I don't feel like a bedtime story tonight.
Oh?
All right, darling, try to get some rest.
Good night.
Pugsley, what on earth are you doing?
- I'm writing a letter.
- A letter?
- Scented?
- Licorice, my favorite.
"And the way you squint your little beady eyes is real keen".
Pugsley darling, that's no way to write a love letter.
Why?
What should I say?
Oh, I do wish I had some of the letters your father wrote me when we were courting.
Why, thank you, Thing.
That's very thoughtful.
Now, your father wrote some very fiery letters.
Here's one.
That was a little too fiery.
Let's see.
No, I don't think so.
Perhaps you better write some letters in your own way, dear.
Now, kiss Mother and run to bed.
It's very late.
Good night, darling.
Oh, boy!
Dear Teacher "Dear Teacher, this is" One of your students wrote this letter?
I've always considered the Addams boy a little strange, but this letter I decided it was a matter for the principal.
What's he doing in the fourth grade?
There's no signature?
How do you know the Addams boy wrote it?
I saw him sneak it on my desk.
Well, you had better see Romeo's folks about this immediately.
I was hoping you'd come with me, Mr. Jennings.
You're so diplomatic, assured, poised, masculine.
- True, true.
- And I am so bumbling, - helpless, ineffective - True, true.
- Feminine.
- Come, Miss Dunbar.
You'll have to handle this yourself.
And please, Miss Dunbar, try not to make a fool of yourself.
Yes, Mr. Jennings.
That kid should be writing Peyton Place.
Wonderful sport, Lurch.
It has its ups and downs.
Just like life and love.
That reminds me, - how is Pugsley?
- Normal.
Already forgotten his teacher.
That's my Pugsley.
Love them and leave them.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
Bring me a ladder, Lurch.
Better answer the doorbell first.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
Pugsley's teacher.
- Ahoy, Miss Dunbar!
- There you are.
Yes.
You know me?
Of course.
Don't you remember that enchanted evening across the crowded PTA meeting?
Never mind the ladder, Lurch.
Alley-oop.
How do you do?
Lurch, you can take the trampoline to your room.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
- Tea, coffee, champagne?
- Please, this is not a social visit.
I have a Well, there's a letter I must read to you.
Well, sit right down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Read away.
- Some of this is embarrassing.
- Really?
My favorite reading.
Very embarrassing.
- Well, then read the parts that aren't.
- There was one sentence.
"When I first saw you from afar, "my heart flamed with a fierce passion, "and when you spoke French, "ooh-la-la!
Ah, your radiant beauty, - "your captivating allure" - "your captivating allure, "drew me to you like honey to a suckle".
Honey to a suckle?
Then you wrote this?
I certainly did.
Oh, Mr. Addams!
I don't know what to say.
I've never had an attractive man like you fall in love with me before.
What?
In fact, I've never had any man fall in love with me before.
That's why I Mr. Addams, do you think we dare go through with this?
Maybe we should stop before it's too late.
Yes, we must end it.
It's madness.
Let it be madness!
What does it matter as long as we have each other?
Mr We have a guest, my dear.
I'll have Lurch set an extra place for dinner.
- I think I'd better explain this to my wife.
- I think you better.
So you see, querida, it wasn't my fault.
Besides, she squeezes harder than that boa constrictor I got you for your last birthday.
I can sympathize with her.
I know how irresistible you are.
I guess I'll have to tell her she's making a mistake.
- Darling, you can't do that.
- I can't?
Well, of course not.
It would crush her, darling.
Two rejections in one day.
- Two?
- First Pugsley, and then you.
Cara, you're such an understanding woman.
It would be cruel to hurt her.
You must act the part of a great lover.
But if I lead her on, she'll have to know the truth eventually.
"'Tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all".
- Lincoln?
- Jefferson.
I'll even play the jealous wife, give it a touch of realism.
Morticia, you're all woman.
Yes, I know.
For you, I'll do it.
I can't.
Querida, I can't even look at another woman.
Darling, you're doing it for me.
For you.
Oh, darling, say it with flowers.
And, Gomez, now, I know how you get carried away, so when I say "stop," stop.
For you, Morticia.
Miss Dunbar, my treasure.
Mr. Addams, I've been thinking about us.
- I'm afraid we're making a mistake.
- A mistake?
- Did Samson and Delilah make a mistake?
- Yes.
Did Antony and Cleopatra make a mistake?
- Yes.
- Did Romeo and Juliet make a mistake?
- Yes.
- Well, everyone's entitled to one mistake.
- You're my only passion!
- Mr. Addams.
Mr Let's fly away together, to the Black Forest.
- But what about your wife?
- She's been there.
A Black Forest summer, winter, autumn, spring - Fester, can't you see I'm busy?
- Gomez, how could you?
It's easy.
Watch.
I don't know about you, but I come from a long line of stool pigeons.
Morticia!
Morticia, I don't know how to tell you this, but your husband's a fake.
My husband, Gomez?
You got another?
He's playing footsies with another woman.
And when I say footsies, I don't mean footsies.
Dear noble Gomez.
- Noble?
- He's just pretending, Uncle Fester.
Pretending?
Then why is he drooling so much?
He has to be convincing.
He sure convinced me.
Having that woman laying down in his arms like that, with her hair straggling down all over her shoulders and her eyes afire and her cheeks aflame - You saw all that?
- Yeah, and I only caught a glance.
I do believe dear Gomez has built up that woman's ego sufficiently.
- Uncle Fester, you better go tell him.
- Don't worry, I know what to tell him.
Oh, Uncle Fester, now, do be discreet.
We don't want to offend Miss Dunbar.
Just tell Gomez I said, "Don't.
Stop".
- "Don't.
Stop".
- He'll understand.
You know me.
Old dependable.
I just adore finger-painting.
- But, Mr. Addams, your wife.
- What wife?
Nobody must be allowed to intrude on our ecstasy.
I can't look.
Gomez, I've always loved you as a nephew.
Why not?
I'm your uncle.
But you're not yourself, Gomez.
I can tell just by touching you.
Suddenly you're hard and cold.
But if you won't listen to me, perhaps you will listen to Morticia.
I should have put out the "don't disturb" sign.
There you are.
Sorry.
The Black Forest is indescribable.
Let me tell you about it.
- Morticia says, "Don't stop".
- Don't stop?
Thanks.
What was I saying before we were interrupted?
Oh, yes.
I was saying that nobody must be allowed to interrupt.
Morticia!
- Morticia, we've lost him.
- He didn't stop?
- Didn't even break stride.
- Oh, dear.
Oh, here, Uncle Fester, finish this for me.
- Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling.
Ivy-covered cottage beside a lovely swamp.
- But, Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling.
We can find our own little secluded hideaway, far from everyone, where the magic stillness of the night is broken only by the merry buzzing of the tsetse fly.
- But, Mr. Addams - Yes, my darling.
- What is it?
- You're breaking my back.
- Gomez.
- Excuse me.
- Well, what do you think?
- I think it's dreadful.
Well, I was doing a lot better until her back gave out.
- I'll show you what I mean.
- Gomez, what's gotten into you?
- You're acting disgracefully.
- I am?
Yes, you are.
It's as though you don't care at all.
- It's as bad as that?
- It most certainly is!
- Lf you'd only make some effort - Just watch me.
I'll show you what the man you married is really like.
Oh, what have I done?
Our wonderful life together, our magical moments, gone, broken, smashed to bits.
Pardon me.
Good God, Morticia, what a performance!
Worthy of a Sarah Bernhardt, a Greta Garbo, a Mamie Van Doren.
Oh, Gomez, why?
Why?
Why?
Why not?
Why not?
Why not?
How was that?
Oh, but enough of this small talk!
My heart belongs to what's-her-name!
Please, Gomez, please, dear, think of all of our happy moments together.
A sham!
Where were we?
- Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling.
Can't you see it's all over between us?
Gomez, I'm leaving this house and taking the children with me.
Go ahead and leave!
- Mr. Addams - Hush, my darling.
Take the children.
Take the neighbors' children.
Take Uncle Fester.
Take Mama.
- She's your mama.
- Very well, we'll share custody.
But I get full custody of Lurch.
Mr. Addams.
There you are.
Mr. Addams, will you please pick me up?
Yes, of course.
It will be you and me.
Mr. Jennings.
Miss Dunbar.
Sir, if you're a jealous husband or boyfriend, the whole thing was a mistake.
- An April fool joke.
- An April fool joke in October?
I like to get an early start.
- My glasses.
Where are my glasses?
- Where did you drop them, Miss Dunbar?
- I didn't drop them, they just flew off.
- Flew Why, Isobel, you have beautiful eyes.
Sir, you are leading this poor, lovesick girl on, and I just want to say, good luck.
Querida, I was just carrying out your instructions.
But I pleaded with you to stop.
I thought you were acting.
Believe me, cara mia, when you spoke to me in French, it was all I could do to restrain myself.
What was it you said?
Speak some more French.
- Anything!
- Hush, my darling.
Oh, my poor darling one, it must have been torture for you, making love to that strange woman all the time, while you were longing for me, and I made you do it.
Oh, can you ever forgive me, darling, can you?
- Yes, if you get me a pulmotor.
- Of course, dear, for Christmas.
- But I - Hush, my darling.
Oh, dear.
I ruined your newspaper.
Think nothing of it.
It's last week's.
That's very sensible, dear.
I understand they're much cheaper.
Much.
Oh, the mail is in.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh, it's from dear Miss Dunbar.
Did she get over me?
- Completely.
- She did?
- Pugsley, where are you going?
- To mail a letter.
- Oh, to who?
- My new teacher.
I hope this one isn't as fickle.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Oh, it's a lovely night.
That looks wonderful, Gomez.
Yeah, all it needs is a final touch.
Absolutely breathtaking.
All right, Lurch, let's have it.
Thank you.
No damage.
Beautiful.
Beautiful!
Querida, let's have a go at the tower.
Now, darling, that's Lurch's room.
Besides, you've had enough fun for one day.
Lurch can use the playroom.
We can both take turns with the wrecking ball.
Temperance, temperance.
Too much of a good thing Besides, I have all of these bills to get out.
Very well.
Thank you, Lurch.
Well, now.
Let's see.
Thank you.
Darling, our phone bill has been unusually high this month.
Have you been making any calls?
Just to Saudi Arabia on that oil merger.
I dialed four or five times before I got the right number.
It's a bit expensive.
Oil merger?
Abigail Adams and the rest of those Boston one-D Adamses are trying to block the deal.
In fact, they're trying to go to court to have me removed as executor to the family fortunes.
A financial wizard like you?
Abigail's always fancied herself as the head of the Addams family.
Besides, she thinks I'm some kind of a nut.
You?
Impossible.
She even tried to prove it in court once before.
Good thing the judge fell asleep.
Darling, if dear Abigail is as smart as she thinks she is, she'll drop this case.
After all, the family fortune couldn't be in better hands.
Could it?
Never has the family been able to declare larger tax losses.
There, that proves your financial genius.
Tish, you just parlez vous.
Hey!
Somebody say something about Abigail Adams dropping the case?
Well, it sure don't look like it.
She's here in town.
- She is?
- Yeah.
"Abigail Quincy Adams is in town on family business.
"It is assumed she will mix business with pleasure "by visiting her grandchildren".
I didn't know she had grandchildren in this town.
Well, whosever grandmother she is, thank goodness she's not our little Pugsley and Wednesday's grandmother.
Actually, she's only a cousin by marriage.
Still, I do think we ought to pay our respects and invite her over.
Our worst enemy?
I'm gonna faint!
Quick!
Water.
Thank you, Thing.
What's the matter with Fester?
He heard Abigail Adams was in town.
I guess the shock was too much for him.
Better try my remedy.
It always ends his spells.
That felt good.
Do it again.
My turn.
No, no, no, Gomez, darling.
Now, put it down.
I want to find out what this is all about.
Morticia, Gomez just told you.
Abigail is out to get him.
- She has been shooting dirty pool.
- She has?
Well, then, she's not welcome in this house.
Hold it.
That Abigail probably has got spies all over the place.
We better look around.
Can't be too careful.
The walls have ears.
Interesting thought.
Wednesday's in love, Wednesday's in love!
Wednesday's in love!
Now, you stop that, Pugsley.
It's not nice to tease your sister, darling.
Besides, she's been taking judo lessons.
- See what I mean?
- Yes, sir.
By the way, has there been any phone calls for me?
She means Robespierre Courtney.
She's even doing her hair different for him.
Yesterday she got so upset while waiting for his call that she let the trains run for 20 minutes without one crash.
Wednesday, you didn't.
Shocking waste of electricity.
We could have recharged Uncle Fester I'm sorry, Father, but you don't measure love with dollars.
That's a woman for you.
That's love.
I'm afraid it's unrequited.
Poor little Wednesday's so upset.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry to hear that child's so unhappy.
I think I'll just go down to the cellar and wrestle with the alligator.
Mama We can't think of our own selfish pleasures now.
We must think of Wednesday.
You're right, Morticia.
The alligator can wait.
Now, we must get Wednesday together with Robespierre.
We've just got to get you together with Wednesday Addams.
But you said you didn't want me to have anything to do with those kooks.
That was before your mother found out the little girl was related to Abigail Quincy Adams.
It just so happens that Abigail Quincy Adams is one of the most socially prominent women in America.
Is that what you meant by riffraff?
Mother was just trying to have her little joke.
You want Mother to be the president of her club, don't you?
Why don't you spell it out for the kid?
Your mother wants you to wangle us an invitation to the Addams family.
Then she can say she had tea with Abigail Quincy Adams and we can get our name in the society column.
You're impossible.
That makes us a perfect pair.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Courtney.
Morticia Addams?
Tea?
Yes, we'd be delighted.
Oh, of course I'll bring Robespierre.
And how is dear grandmother?
Splendid.
Toodle-oo.
We're going to have tea with the Addams family!
Hurray for our side.
Isn't that nice?
She especially asked about you, Mama.
I always was the popular one in the family.
You know, I do think I'd better have a talk with Wednesday.
You know, woman to woman.
I can give her a few helpful hints.
Querida, you are to romance what Mama is to dignity and charm.
Darling.
Oh, that dress does do things for you.
Black is such a happy color.
Now, remember, my dear, in all your relationships with boys, you must be shy and modest.
Yes, Mother.
Poise and good manners are important, too.
For instance, when Robespierre comes, I think it would be proper for you to curtsy.
- Curtsy?
- Yes, let's try it.
In this dress?
I see what you mean.
Let's forget about the curtsy.
- Now, what are you going to talk about?
- My spiders.
That's marvelous.
If the spiders don't get him, and being shy and modest doesn't get him, use the trap.
Good hunting.
Very becoming.
I like the style.
Still, dressing isn't everything when it comes to pleasing a young man.
A young lady has to know all the latest steps.
So, Thing, if you don't mind That's it!
By george, I think you've got it!
But, just in case the dance doesn't work, try this.
Very nice.
Very nice.
But there's just one thing that boys can't resist.
A nice long face.
Beautiful.
But just in case that doesn't work Good.
Good.
But you know what attracts a man most?
- Money?
- No.
Hair, a woman's hair.
See?
And you're my type.
Perfect.
But just in case the hair doesn't work What's that?
Love dust.
What advice do you have for me, Lurch?
Oh, I love you.
Nothing like a bit of cricket to while away an hour or two.
Darling, are you sure this is the way it's played?
Querida, I was the scourge of the fields of Eton.
I can hit the ball with my eyes shut.
Serve it up.
Yes, dear.
Oh, darling, I'm so sorry.
Nothing at all.
I did make contact.
That must be the Courtneys.
Let Lurch get them.
Once more, my dear.
The Courtneys.
Gomez Addams here.
How do you do?
And this is my lovely wife, Morticia.
How do you do?
I guess you folks go in for pop art.
Or something.
So, this is Wednesday's little friend Robespierre.
Oh, yes.
He certainly looks it.
I'll call Wednesday.
Wednesday, darling?
Come along, dear, and say hello to your little friend.
Wednesday, what was that?
Love dust.
Children today.
So precocious.
Would you children like to go out and play in the cave?
No.
- In the swamp?
- No.
Did you say cave?
And swamp?
It's not much, but room enough to romp.
Wednesday, darling, why don't you and Robespierre go and play with the trains?
Would you like that, Robespierre?
Well, all right.
Spirited little fellow you have there.
Please, come in.
Please, sit down.
I suppose you'd like to meet the rest of the family?
After all, a child is a product of its environment.
Will you excuse us?
Oh, Cousin Itt!
Your cousin?
He's up in the fireplace?
Loves privacy.
Itt, are you there?
He's there, all right.
Itt, please, come down.
There are some people here we want you to meet.
Mr. And Mrs. Courtney, this is our Cousin Itt.
Cousin what?
Not What, Itt.
He always says the right thing.
Morticia, I can't get this thing tight enough.
Dear, you're so helpless.
This is the only thing that cures his headaches.
Fester, these are Robespierre's parents.
Oh, hi.
Who's Robespierre?
He's the little tyke Wednesday's set her cap for.
Oh.
When's the wedding?
Now, look, they're just children.
This is just a social call.
We've always admired Abigail Adams.
Abigail!
Excuse us.
Honey, do you know a good divorce lawyer?
Henry, rich people are all eccentric.
Nobody is that rich.
I know a spy when I see one.
He has the face of THRUSH.
And did you see all those pens in his pocket?
Microphones.
Are you sure?
Have I ever been wrong?
Now don't answer that.
Now, Itt, you keep an eye out Well, you just stand guard.
Come on.
Watch.
Look, why don't we just say hello to Abigail Adams and get out of here?
What's your hurry?
Hey!
Very interesting pens you have there.
Yeah.
Be more interesting especially if they had ink in them.
Oh, you You Oh, dear.
Don't worry.
We'll do something about the dress.
But you must admit, it does look better in a darker shade.
Now, go on, then.
Which one has the microphone?
Microphone?
Uncle Fester has an uncanny sense about these things.
Uncanny?
Excuse us.
Eleanor, I want to be fair about this.
You may have custody of Robespierre.
What if Abigail calls all those witnesses and gets Gomez back in court again?
Dear, that could be dangerous.
Cara, was Stonewall Addams afraid?
When he led his troops into battle?
When he flunked his physical.
I have it.
I shall win our friends over with a demonstration of the Gomez Addams financial wizardry.
Then can I shoot them in the back?
There will be no violence.
Count me out.
Itt, I'll play you a game of solitaire in the chimney.
Come on.
Come, dear.
Querida, maybe we should let Fester take a shot.
He hasn't got very good aim.
Your way is the honorable way.
Courtney, how would you like to become rich?
We only came here to meet Nonsense, Mr. Courtney.
It's really quite painless.
And besides, it's the least we can do after ruining Mrs. Courtney's dress.
Old man, you're buying yourself Yes, I have a private line to my broker.
- Blooker - Now, wait a minute.
I can't afford 10,000 shares of anything.
No problem.
We'll just have them pick up 1,000 for you.
My husband is so understanding.
I'm getting out of this booby trap.
Robespierre!
Blooker, cancel that order.
My, but your husband's a jumpy one.
Robespierre.
Oh, Mr. Courtney, I'm so glad you decided to stay.
Blooker, cancel that cancellation.
Lurch, put Mr. Courtney in the good chair.
Blooker, buy 1,000 shares of Consolidated Lint and charge it to Henry Courtney.
C-O-U-R-T-N-E-Y.
Courtney.
Well, I'll give you all the details in the morning.
Yes, I'll hold on.
Please At 86, eh?
Good work, Blooker.
Congratulations, old man, you're on the road to success.
I don't want 1,000 shares of Consolidated Lint.
Now, now, Mr. Courtney.
A deal's a deal.
Let's see how you're doing.
Just as I thought.
Consolidated Lint, 86 and a half.
- 82.
- 82?
Isn't this exciting?
Sell, please sell.
Sell.
Too late.
62 and an eighth.
Excuse me, please.
Darling.
I'm not too sure, but I don't think Mr. Courtney is very happy in Consolidated Lint.
Well, we can certainly take care of that.
I'll swing him into National Dust.
Blooker, sell Courtney's Consolidated Lint.
And pick up 1,000 shares of National Dust.
Please, you can thank me some other time.
- Good show, Blooker.
- Hurry, darling.
Let's see what it's doing.
Did it go up?
By george, it's up eight and a half points.
- National Dust?
- Consolidated Lint.
- Back to 70.
- What about National Dust?
Down three.
Bad business, shifting horses in mid-stream.
I'm sure dear Abigail knows that as well as anyone.
Consolidated Lint.
Up to 75.
- Up to 80.
- And National Dust?
Holding steadily at 54.
It pays to buy the better stock.
But it's not paying me.
If you make me stick to this deal, I'll be broke, bankrupt, penniless.
Nonsense, old man.
If you're a bit short, I'll take the deal off your hands.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're all even again.
- Thank you.
- Ever make a better deal than that?
Oh, no, never.
Never.
Thank you, Mr. Addams.
Easy come, easy go.
And now if we could just meet old Mrs. Adams.
As soon as she's finished wrestling the alligator.
Wrestling the alligator?
Ah, here she is.
Well, I finally beat that darn alligator.
Dear, Mr. And Mrs. Courtney have been dying to meet you.
She certainly photographs differently.
Do you really wrestle alligators?
Oh, just once in a while.
She actually prefers kangaroos.
This is Abigail Quincy Adams?
Certainly not.
I wouldn't have that woman in this house.
Robespierre!
I'll have Lurch get your hat.
Oh, please get my hat.
The bell's out of order.
Well, think nothing of it.
You rang?
The gentleman's hat, please, Lurch.
Robespierre!
Did you call me, Mother?
What have they done to you?
First she made me blow up the train, and then she wanted to put me in the guillotine just because my name is Robespierre.
My husband is going to write a letter to the papers about this.
How can I?
All my pens are broken.
Let's get out of here.
What's the matter with them?
Soreheads.
Oh, poor Wednesday's going to be broken-hearted.
Where's Robespierre?
Well, darling, I'm afraid you're going to have to forget about Robespierre.
Forget?
I've already forgotten.
He wouldn't even play with Pugsley's octopus.
That just proves it.
He's not our type.
Poor boy.
But as you yourself say, darling, children are products of their environment.
Morticia!
You called?
Pugsley and I are ready.
Ah, good.
You're so thorough, Gomez.
So efficient, so precise.
You know me so well, querida.
Giving our congressman two ways to beautify America.
I like the swinging ball, but this may do the job better and faster.
- You ready, Pugsley?
- Ready, sir.
To improve the American landscape.
Back to nature.
Beautiful, Gomez.
Beautiful!
I'll have to speak to that newsboy.
I've told him we wanted the paper delivered through the back window.
Cara mia, look.
"Abigail Adams returning to Boston.
"Drops plans for fight over Addams Family fortune control".
Now, isn't that nice?
The Courtneys must have given us a good report.

Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family There's nothing like after-dinner music.
It's so soothing, it's making me drowsy.
Darling, I think you had a bit too much dinner.
I've been doing this all day, and it keeps coming out the same.
That's your genius, my dear.
You, too, Mama.
Couldn't resist that stew of yours.
You can't beat a good old-fashioned yak stew.
I shot the yak myself.
I'm afraid I overdid it, though.
I had three helpings.
Five helpings.
Uncle Fester, please.
It isn't easy eating and counting.
I am getting sleepy.
It's time you hit the sack.
Splendid idea.
You rang.
Yes, Lurch, Mr. Addams wishes to hit the sack.
Thank you, Lurch.
Poor darling.
He was sleepy.
Gomez?
Darling, where are you going?
Out.
Walk in night.
Uncle Fester, Gomez just went out sleepwalking.
Nice night for it.
Yes, it is.
I'd join him if I were asleep.
I do hope he took his key.
There.
Then he came home at 4:00 this morning with mud all over his shoes.
Well, that's better than lipstick all over his shirt.
Good morning, my dear, Uncle Fester.
Where is everyone this morning?
- Morning?
- Darling, it's 4:00 in the afternoon.
Well, no wonder I feel so well.
Eighteen hours sleep without waking up once.
Well, what's for lunch?
Some more of that yak stew?
We really must speak to that newspaper boy.
I distinctly told him I wanted the paper delivered at 3:00.
Hey, see this story?
It says that there's a cat burglar in our neighborhood.
Really?
Let's see.
Oh, yes.
"Cat burglar strikes.
- "Two homes robbed".
- Cat burglar, eh?
I hope he doesn't try to steal our cat.
Dear Kitty is such a shy little thing.
Don't worry.
This burglar steals only jewelry, furs and money.
Well, he better not try to rob our house.
Why, I'll give him a karate chop, that's what I'll give him.
That's a pretty song.
Morticia, what's the matter with Gomez?
Oh, it looks like dear Gomez overdid it again.
Too much of Mama's stew.
Just like his father.
Mr. Addams loved my yak gravy on glutton bread.
- Mama, isn't that gluten bread?
- Not the way he ate it.
Gomez, dear, I think you better get up and take a little stroll around the cave.
- Too late.
- Fester, turn off the music.
Poor Gomez.
I do hope he doesn't walk in his sleep again tonight.
Walk?
With the dinner he packed away, he'll be lucky if he can stand up.
I just worry that he might meet that awful cat burglar in a dark alley.
Don't worry, Morticia.
I won't let him out of the house tonight.
I won't let him out of the house tonight.
I'll sit up in front of his door.
You mean stay awake all night?
Only if you promise to sleep with ear plugs.
No need the both of us staying awake.
Oh, you are a darling.
Are you sure he won't get out?
Not with "never sleep" Fester on guard.
Gonna have a little bedtime snack.
Fester?
Fester.
I heard noise.
So, as it turned out, I needn't have worried at all.
When I woke this morning, there was dear Gomez asleep beside me, and his shoes were right where he'd left them.
Except they were covered with mud.
That Mama is a sloppy cleaner.
I thought maybe he'd gone out.
With me standing guard?
Never closed an eye.
I think you're right, Lurch.
It doesn't belong there.
Try that space opposite the mantle.
Morticia, what is that?
It's my new painting.
I call it Children at Play.
Put it over there.
I'm so glad dear Gomez didn't go out last night.
You know that awful cat burglar was on the prowl again.
- He was?
- Yes.
It's in all the newspapers.
They're full of it.
- Full of what, my dear?
Sex?
- Crime.
Sex and crime, America's favorite breakfast diet.
"Cat burglar strikes again.
Six homes robbed".
- He's a real ambitious fella.
- Shame!
Darling, don't you worry about that cat burglar.
I'm sure the police will track him down.
Speaking of tracks, I had the most fascinating dream last night.
I dreamt I was walking along a dark street, and I stepped into a mud puddle with my new shoes.
- The ones you got for our wedding?
- The very ones.
- Now that's what I call a realistic dream.
- You sure you haven't been out?
- Impossible.
- Of course.
I must've picked up the mud down in the cave.
Well, no problem.
Thing.
Uncle Fester, I want you to accompany me to the storeroom.
I'd like a word with the man who never sleeps.
- I tell you, I never shut my eyes.
- Did you sleep with them open?
No, I was on the alert all Look at all the loot.
Morticia, you don't think Gomez!
A cat burglar.
What else?
I've heard of guys taking moonlight jobs, but this is ridiculous.
And I don't want to tell dear Gomez.
It'll unsettle him terribly.
Of course.
He's such an honest thief.
We just must make sure he doesn't leave this house.
Hey, I know.
Why don't I sit up all night and guard his door?
I No, we tried that, didn't we?
- I know what's causing Gomez trouble.
- You do?
It's that yak stew of mine.
I just remembered.
His father used to react the same way.
That's why I quit making it.
Oh, dear.
Lurch, there's a big bowl of it left in the refrigerator.
- Get rid of it at once.
- Yes, Mrs. Addams.
Mama, you'd better get started on another pot of stew.
I just finished this one off.
- Gomez, you didn't.
- I didn't?
Then what's this on my necktie?
He ate it.
Well, I'm off to the library.
Time to play with my train.
The cat burglar strikes again.
Uncle Fester, Mama, what am I going to do?
- Gomez needs help.
- He certainly does need help.
With a load like he brought home last night, he's liable to strain his back.
Morticia, why don't we get him a wheelbarrow?
Uncle Fester, please.
We must find out what makes him steal.
We must delve into his subconscious mind.
Find out what it is - That's it.
Psychic control.
- Psychic what?
The snake charmer and the snake.
Psychic control.
The snake charmer and the Perfect for Gomez.
Darling, are you sure that thing is in tune?
Gomez, dear, please.
It's just a game.
Now listen.
Listen carefully.
Querida, you know I don't like the flute.
Glockenspiel, the sousaphone, yes.
But the flute?
Gomez, darling, concentrate.
Yeah, Gomez, concentrate.
It's so beautiful.
So soothing, so Well, that Fester's really a sleepy one.
Uncle Fester!
Well, how did you make out?
Say, he looks better already.
Fester, dear, we haven't started yet.
Oh, Morticia, I don't think you're playing the right tune for Gomez.
- How about another song?
- Another tune?
How about this?
My favorite song.
So soft, so docile, so Mama!
So sorry.
That flute of yours has a strange effect on people.
Not all people.
I wonder if a bugle would have the same effect.
Concentrate, querida, concentrate.
Now, with the help of this book, we'll find out what makes him steal and cure him.
'"Psychiatry For Fun and Profit, '"or What To Do If Your Analyst's Line Is Busy.
'" Very interesting.
Now, Uncle Fester, you and Mama please leave us alone.
These psychiatrists, when they get someone on the couch, they want everybody to leave.
Now I want you to listen carefully.
When you open your eyes, you will be in your doctor's office.
I am your psychiatrist.
Now open your eyes.
I am going to show you some pictures, and I want you to tell me what they remind you of.
- Sounds like fun.
- All right.
Here's the first one.
- Now, what does that remind you of?
- Stealing.
Stealing?
What about this one?
Robbing.
Robbing?
How about this one?
Robbing the rich.
- Everything reminds you of robbing?
- Naturally.
He's my idol.
- Who?
- Robin Hood.
I'm reading a book about him.
- How are you doing?
- Uncle Fester, I think this is it.
When he steals, he's imitating his hero, Robin Hood.
Yeah, but Robin Hood stole from the rich and gave to the poor.
That's right.
Well, Gomez never gave anything away.
It's still in the storeroom.
Of course.
He's only halfway through the book.
That's it.
Now that we know why he steals, we can make him stop it.
- Hide the book?
- Oh, yes.
Not only that.
Now that he's hypnotized, I'll make him stop walking in his sleep.
Yeah, you better with all that yak stew in him.
I'm going to give you an order and you will obey.
Will obey.
First, you must promise to return everything you've stolen.
Promise.
Oh, dear.
I better get the wheelbarrow.
Morticia, I thought we'd stand guard till you got here.
You are a dear.
Is he resting peacefully?
Sleeping like a babe.
Show her, Lurch.
I thought we might just chain him in, just in case.
I tell you, he's sound asleep, Morticia.
It's unnecessary - He's gone.
- Impossible.
Well, the door was locked and there's no other way - There is another way.
- Well, I certainly have no use for these.
Please, I feel just as badly as you do about Gomez, but there's no need to carry on this way.
Uncle Fester, really.
Gomez must be having a real good night.
Oh, Gomez darling, thank heaven you're home.
Oh, dear.
He's still asleep.
He does more work asleep than he does when he's awake.
Oh, that does it!
This calls for drastic action.
Lurch, now.
Nothing like a nice morning shower.
Me, the cat burglar?
You stole all these things tonight.
Yeah, and in exactly three hours and 20 minutes.
- Not bad.
- You do everything so well.
There's only one way out.
To return these things to their rightful owners.
I told you he was an honest thief.
There's only one small problem.
I don't know who they belong to.
That is a problem.
Morticia, the police!
- The perfect solution.
- Jail?
No.
I'll just explain how this all happened, and they'll help us find the victims.
- Capital idea.
- No, it isn't.
- They won't believe a word of it.
Hide.
- That's a better idea.
Open up, in the name of the law!
Open up the door.
Open up.
Lurch, let the gentlemen in.
Well, we almost nabbed him, but he ducked down an alley.
We got a good look at him, though.
Fellow with a dark mustache and a goofy look.
- We better look upstairs.
- Oh, no.
There's nothing up there but bats.
Let the gentlemen come up if they'd like.
It's all right, child.
This is my grandfather, Alonzo Addams.
Now what's all this nonsense about a cat burglar?
Nonsense?
These are lists of the houses they robbed and the items they took.
- May I see that, please?
- Please, lady, take my word for it.
But I may be able to solve the case.
Everybody's a detective.
My granddaughter is the Sherlock Holmes of the Ladies' Literary League.
Oh, yes.
Elementary, my dear Watson.
- Tish, that's French.
- Grandfather, please.
Feisty old gent, isn't he?
That's an overgrown kid.
Fastest shave I ever got.
Looks kind of familiar, doesn't he, Sarge?
- Very.
- Please, gentlemen, let's not jump to conclusions.
Can't blame a man for what he does in his sleep.
We tried to stop him with psychic control.
What's that?
You know, the snake charmer and the snake.
Psychic I'll show you.
By george, you really put them to sleep.
- I'll get the water.
- No.
Go upstairs and get the loot.
Justice will be done at last.
Well, that about does it.
You will follow this list very carefully and give everything back to their rightful owners.
Back to rightful owners.
Almost forgot.
As I always say, when you need help, call the police.
It must be around here somewhere.
I had it just last night.
Did you lose something, darling?
My new platinum ruby and diamond-studded wristwatch.
- I left it on the hall table last night.
- Oh, was that yours, Gomez?
Yes.
Have you seen it?
I thought it was part of the loot.
I put it back in the Sergeant's pocket.
My $5,000 watch?
I wonder who the Sergeant returned that to?
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Mama, cook up some more yak stew.
Oh, no.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family I think I've had enough moon.
Thank you.
Gomez, darling, do be careful.
You know how prone you are to moonburn.
Never fear, querida.
My skin is so white it won't peel anymore.
My head is a little tingly.
Uncle Fester, how about you?
Would you like another little dab of lanolin?
No, thanks.
I like it, but it gives me heartburn.
Uncle Fester, the last time we moonbathed, you ate the goose grease.
This time, the lanolin.
What did you expect me to do with it, smear it all over my face?
Very interesting.
Very interesting.
Is Jupiter transiting Uranus, dear?
No, our next-door neighbor is just stepping into his shower.
Oh, well, it is a warm night.
- And how are you, Mama?
- Fine, fine.
- She likes being buried.
- And playing groundhog.
Mama, you sure you're getting enough air?
I took a deep breath before they buried me.
Oh, yes.
The family that plays together stays together.
The telephone.
Don't worry, my dear, I left strict orders not to be disturbed.
How very thoughtful.
- I don't care who's calling, do you?
- Certainly not.
- Unless you do.
- I don't.
- Well, I do.
Let's find out.
- Yes, let's.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch, we were somewhat curious about - Lurch, who was that on the phone?
- Man from Strife magazine.
Strife magazine?
I should think one subscription for each member of the family would be enough.
- He was a photographer.
- A photographer?
He said he'd come back next week.
I wonder what he wanted.
Oh, this is just a shot in the dark, dear, but since he was a photographer, I suppose he wanted to take a photo.
Sound thinking, my dear, but of whom?
Or is it who?
This is the time they choose their Man of the Year.
- Exactly.
- Tish, you don't suppose And why not?
Who deserves the honor more than you?
Well, that's true, but Well, there are others, of course.
Who knows more about Zen-Yogi, breeding barracudas and wrecking railroad trains?
No one.
But But still And who can match your dexterity with the boomerang, your skill at Parcheesi, your savoir faire?
Tish.
Those French words.
They win me.
Darling, grab your telescope.
Imagine.
My darling sweet Gomez on the cover of Strife magazine.
I can just see it now.
Those cover pictures are dreadful, especially the ones on Strife magazine.
No problem, we'll simply go through the family album and select one of our own.
And I know just the one.
It captures all your inner fire, your sterling intensity and the real you.
This one?
Oh, no, darling.
That's lovely, but that's not the one I meant.
You were such a distinguished little baby with such a distinguished little moustache.
Yes, saved Mama the trouble of straining the baby food.
We've gone through the entire album.
This is the only one left.
Gomez, darling, that's it!
See how it captures your inner dynamics, your sense of destiny, your divine fire.
By george, you are right!
It is the real me.
Oh, close your eyes.
Can't you just imagine it on the cover of Strife magazine?
Picture like that.
They may want to save it for the Man of the Century.
Oh, it's wonderful, Gomez.
Simply Oh, darling Cleopatra, cough up that photograph.
Come on, cough it up.
Darling, please control yourself.
After all, aggression only breeds aggression.
Now, wait.
Cleopatra, dear, let Mother have it, sweetheart.
Come on, darling.
Perhaps, we should use a little aggression.
- Oh, it's too late.
- There goes the real me.
Darling, why don't we have Croom Strauss, that same photographic genius who took that picture, take another one of you.
- Capital idea!
- I'll have Lurch lay out your best suit.
- Querida, this is my best suit.
- Oh?
Don't you remember?
I bought dozens of them.
- I wanted nothing but best suits.
- Of course, dear.
Well, off to Croom Strauss.
I know exactly where that exclusive little studio of his is located.
Croom Strauss.
Come.
I'm afraid he's gone out of business, the only photographer, the only artist, the only virtuoso of the prismatic lens who could capture the real Gomez Addams, gone.
Cheer up, darling.
I'm sure there are dozens of photographers who can take your picture.
Take my picture, yes, but capture the real me?
Never!
Well, perhaps, not dozens, but at least several?
A couple?
One?
No.
Well, you're right, dear.
This is the bitterest blow since the city made us fill in our lovely patch of quicksand.
Good morning, Uncle Fester.
Up at your exercises early, I see.
You're just in time for a nice hot cup of henbane.
Oh, no, thank you, Morticia, I'm on a diet.
I just had some soap crunchies.
Real bubbly.
Fester, you're going to have to watch those in-between-meal snacks.
You'll be on those stilts all day.
- Gomez darling, cup of henbane?
- No, nothing.
When are you coming down?
You've been up there three days.
You know how he is when he's depressed.
Well, being made Man of the Year is depressing.
It's because we can't find the one photographer in the whole world who can capture the real Gomez Addams.
Is that all?
Your troubles are over.
They are?
Like Michelangelo with a camera.
You know where he is?
- Sure.
- Where?
- Standing right in front of you.
- Back to the chandelier.
Oh, no, Gomez.
I know my way around the camera.
That's true, darling.
Remember his studies of salamanders spawning in a mud bath?
By george, Fester, you're the solution to my problems.
Let's get started.
- Oh, wait, dear.
Freshen up first.
- Freshen up?
Is that necessary?
Necessary.
- You ready, Fester?
- Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready.
Perfect!
You never looked better, Gomez.
Fester, you're sure the camera's pointed in the right direction?
Well, maybe it is a little off-center.
Oh, now I really have it.
It's going to be the best picture you ever took.
Uncle Fester, you're focusing on the warthog.
Oh, yeah.
Probably the best picture the warthog ever took.
Fester, don't you think you'd better start with Cousin Itt?
Oh, sure.
I want this to look real pretty.
Better take off his hat and glasses.
Capital idea.
Darling, I think a profile shot would be much more interesting, don't you?
Good thinking, my dear.
There.
- How's that?
- Much better.
Why, I think that's a lovely idea, Cousin Itt.
- Why don't you wear your new suit?
- Yes, and have Thing give you a little trim.
Okay, Gomez.
Let's get cracking.
We're going to make photographic history.
Now, darling, let me see that lovely Addams charm.
Tish.
That French.
- All right.
Hold it.
- Just a moment.
Darling, later.
Later.
Later.
That's funny.
Now it doesn't look so good.
- How about this?
- Much better.
Okay.
One, two A little lower, please.
A little lower, please.
Lower.
Lower.
Lower.
Hold it!
Uncle Fester, did you get it?
Yeah, right in the head.
Darling.
I've hired a private detective to find your favorite photographer.
Just haven't heard from him yet.
Well, maybe you ought to hire a private detective to find the private detective you hired.
I'll never come down.
You know, it must be nicer up there than I thought it was.
Darling, Gomez Hello.
Oh, yes.
Yes, just one moment, please.
Darling, it's the detective I hired.
Yes.
How wonderful!
Gomez, he found our photographer.
Eureka!
Morticia Quiet, please.
Now, pardon me.
Once more.
Where can we find him?
Oh, dear, that's dreadful.
Thank you so much.
Querida, don't keep me in suspense.
What time is the appointment with Croom Strauss?
- Darling, we have a slight complication.
- There's someone ahead of me.
Thousands!
He now works for the Department of Motor Vehicles.
He takes the pictures they use on the drivers' licenses.
What a proud thing it is to live in a state with such high aesthetic requirements.
Don't you see?
The only way you can possibly be photographed by him is to get a driver's license.
Bully!
I've always wanted one.
Darling, you've never been able to drive.
True.
But there's very little I don't know about the modern horseless carriage.
- Except how to shift gears.
- And steer.
Yeah, and put on the brakes.
Well, those things do give me a little trouble.
A little trouble?
Remember the blue falcon bird we had?
Oh, yeah.
Big Blue.
Nothing could stop that car, scorching desert, snow-covered mountains, she could go anywhere.
Except between two street cars.
Still as solid as the day she rolled out of the showroom.
Yeah.
- And so is our old Stanley Steamer.
- Makes a beautiful mobile, doesn't it?
By Jove, after all these years, she can still build up a fine head of steam.
Querida, just a little practice and I'll be right back in there again.
Marvelous idea, darling.
I shall be your instructress.
- Gomez, you're riding the clutch again.
- Really, certainly rides beautifully.
Now, darling, listen.
You're going through a school zone.
School zone.
Your speedometer is registering - Seventy-five per.
- What are you doing wrong?
Blocking traffic?
Think, darling.
Think.
'Course, I'm not waving to the little nippers as I drive by.
Hiya, kids, how are you?
- Gomez, dear.
Put on your brake.
- Brake.
That's not the brake, Gomez!
- Are you sure?
- Pretty sure.
This is the brake.
Oh, well, by this time, I'm out of the school zone, so I shift into high, and away we go.
Gomez, darling, you just shifted into reverse.
Well, these new cars are not what they used to be.
Neither am I. I'm pooped.
Well, I guess we're all agreed that the test run was a huge success.
You rang?
I did indeed, Lurch.
Bring the car around to the door and let us away to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
I'm off to take my driver's test.
I couldn't have said it better myself, Lurch.
Tallyho, one and all!
Hey, what kind of an outfit is that?
Just the very latest in modern motoring.
One should always dress for the occasion, shouldn't one?
Yes, darling.
That's why I'd like for you to wear this.
Egad, what a smart little beanie!
- You like it, dear?
- Love it.
Though there seems to be an overabundance of smog today.
Well, in that case, I think we'd better dispense with it.
Anything you say, querida.
Darling, are you sure you can handle this?
My dear, I've made an exhaustive study of the internal combustion engine.
Lurch, how do you start it?
It sounds like Cousin Itt.
Cousin Itt!
What are you doing under there?
You washed your hair?
And you were sitting under the hood, letting it dry.
Very clever.
Oh, I love your new hairdo.
It's so So you!
I'm sorry we disturbed you.
Gomez, you're riding the clutch again.
- Smooth, isn't it?
- Only for standing still, dear.
Well, if it's action you want - Triumph of man over machine.
- Really, darling, whose machine?
A whole slough of them, blocking my path.
Lurch, this can go on the mobile.
He's taking his written test.
Good, then he'll never get to the driver's test.
Perfect score!
And in 10 seconds flat.
A new indoor record.
- Oh, that's wonderful, darling.
- Let's go.
Oh, this is the dedicated public servant who's going to conduct the driving test.
My dedicated wife, my dedicated uncle, my dedicated cousin and Now, let's get it over with.
Please, wait.
I want to be with him when he takes his driving test.
Lady, I wish I didn't have to be with him.
No wives, relatives, or dogs.
He's a bit touchy about that.
I do think he's getting used to it.
Come, dear.
Let's get moving.
But, Cousin Itt, what safer place is there to stand than right here?
Another town?
He's the family wit.
- We're off.
- Darling These old thoroughbreds are very temperamental.
Mr. Addams, you do know how to drive?
Sir, I'm going to treat you to the drive of your life.
Thank you, Thing.
Well, sir, what's the word?
- You ought to be arrested.
- Arrested?
For even thinking of driving.
I never drive.
Lurch, our chauffeur, does all the driving.
Then why?
Why do you want a driver's license?
For the picture, of course.
The picture?
Of course?
Sure.
The picture you put on the drivers' licenses.
- You want that?
- Precisely.
You have a new employee, Wolfgang Croom Strauss, the world's greatest photographer.
That creep?
He was fired the same day he was hired.
And between you and me, I don't know how he lasted that long.
Great art is never appreciated in its own time.
Well, we're right back where we started.
Destiny seems determined to brush me aside.
Brush.
Gomez, darling, that's it!
Tish, you're marvelous.
Only you as an artist could capture both the inner and outer Gomez, simultaneously.
French.
Darling Gomez, please.
The painting, dear.
Querida, you've done it!
The perfect picture for Strife magazine's Man of the Year.
Hey, it's my turn.
I wonder who that could be at the door.
- What was that?
- Must be termites.
King size.
Man from Strife.
Come in.
Come in, old man.
Strife magazine has been one of our favorites.
- We simply devour it from cover to cover.
- Quite delicious.
- I guess we know why you're here.
- You mean about the picture?
Yes, it's all ready for you.
Took a bit of doing, but here it is.
Thing?
Your Man of the Year.
There's been some mistake.
You see, we already have our Man of the Year.
But the picture.
I thought you wanted a picture.
Yeah, of your house.
Our house.
You mean, we've made House of the Year?
Well, sort of.
You see we are running a story on haunted houses, and yours has been chosen the spookiest one of all.
Thank you.
We do try.
This is even better than Man of the Year.
This is a salute to the whole family.

Very well, darling, if you say so.
Where's Mama?
I want her to see this.
Did somebody call me?
Mama, why the suit of armor?
No offense, Morticia, but I feel more secure wearing this ever since Gomez told me that a bullwhip can slice a man's head off like that!
Oh, I'm sure he was exaggerating, but suit yourself.
Are you ready, Gomez?
Ready, my dear.
Remember, aim, close your eyes and fire away.
Mama, speak to me.
Can you hear me?
Certainly.
There's no need to shout.
Lucky thing I remembered to duck.
Mail's in.
I do believe Thing is trying to tell us something.
Of course, it's a letter from Spain.
Gracias, Thing.
Oh, darling, it's for you.
You open it, my dear.
Maybe it's a bill.
Oh, you're so thoughtful.
I better give this a rub down before it stiffens up.
That's interesting, it's from Pamplona.
Pamplona?
I knew it.
Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas.
Who are they?
They?
Him.
Back in the old country, our families were as close as Siamese twins.
How cozy.
Oh, well, he says he's arriving here all the way from Spain tomorrow morning.
Tomorrow morning.
Oh, good heavens!
Gomez!
Wait, why don't we surprise Gomez?
You little imp.
That's what everyone called me in my sorority.
Oh, it says here that he's coming for his daughter Consuella's wedding.
Weddings are such fun.
Yes, especially when everyone cries.
Gomez!
You big boy now.
Last time I see you, you so little.
- I'm Lurch.
- A church?
- Lurch.
- Oh, Lurch.
The butler.
I see.
I Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas.
Follow me.
Oh, Consuella, I am so happy we have wait for you to marry Gomez.
It is your wish even though I do not know Senor Addams.
Only Senor Gomez Addams is good enough for marry Molinas.
That is why his grandpapa and I signed marriage contract when you are little girl.
- Don Xavier!
- Gomez!
Oh, this must be Consuella.
My, what a big girl you are!
Gomez, that is the duena.
How do you say?
The chaperone.
This is my Consuella.
But of course.
I haven't seen you since I was five, but I remember how we used to play casa.
This is Morticia.
Morticia, this is Don Xavier Molinas, duena and Consuella.
How you do?
How do you do?
Querida, this is my hermana.
My sister, you might say.
- What did he say?
- He say she his sister.
Oh, his sister!
Sí.
Did you ever think I'd marry such a beautiful woman?
- Oh, Senor.
- Oh, but I knew you would.
And you have waste no time.
This must be the padre, no?
Padre, no.
That's Uncle Fester.
He went south with his polo team.
And they're winning, too.
Don Xavier, Consuella, la duena.
You remember Mama?
I'll see about your rooms, ladies.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch, would you please help with the luggage?
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
That's the day you fought two bulls, back to back.
But it was nothing, I Thank you, Thing.
In America, the servants are cheap.
To the Molinas.
To you and your lovely daughter, Consuella.
To you and your sister, Morticia.
No, Don Xavier, Morticia's not my sister, she's my wife.
Life?
Oh, sí.
You lead a wonderful life.
- Consuella will be happy with such a man.
- Thank you.
I hope she finds one.
Has Gomez changed much since he was a little boy?
Oh, he so little, me so little.
Only remember we play casa.
- You played what?
- Casa.
House.
Oh?
Now Gomez and I get married, you and I real sister.
What's she mean by that?
Well, I'm sure she means In Spain, Gomez is a very common name.
She probably means she's going to marry someone by that name.
No, me marry Gomez, you brother.
- My brother?
- Sí.
- Who?
- He.
- My Gomez?
- My Gomez.
You know, Don Xavier, I have a vast network of offices all over the world.
My girl in Madrid did nothing but try to locate you.
And then there's my girl in Barcelona, and of course my girl in Toledo and then I have two girls in Sevilla and then there's good old Sadie in Lisbon.
Do you hear what I hear?
I'm counting.
So many girls.
Can you not get rid of a few?
I'd be lost without them.
- The wife is always the last to know.
- Oh, dear.
Now, about the dowry The hand of Consuella should be enough for the lucky groom.
It is a matter of honor.
I do not have dollars, but perhaps you will hold this for me.
"I owe you one million pesetas".
Well, let's see, that's Thank you, Thing.
One million pesetas is 16,600 potatoes.
- I'd better keep this in a safe place.
- You will accept it, then?
I shall guard it with my life.
- Wife?
- Life.
Let me show you Morticia's beautiful African strangler.
- That Bluebeard.
- He should be boiled in oil.
No, he enjoys that too much.
Besides, we must think of the children.
- Why don't you think of yourself?
- Oh, it's too late for me.
But we can still save Consuella.
She can't be just another cipher, another number in his harem.
My son with a harem.
I didn't know he had it in him.
Cousin Itt?
It's me, Morticia.
Good afternoon.
Cousin Itt, I'm in such a terrible dilemma.
Gomez is being untrue, but I don't want to get him into trouble.
What should I do?
Have my head examined?
But I still love him and he wants to marry Consuella.
Have his head examined?
You may have something, there.
There must be something wrong with him.
He has girls all over the world.
I'm sure he could get one for you, but that doesn't solve my problem.
I'm sure it would solve yours.
Oh, Cousin Itt, I thought you were going to be so helpful.
Haven't you ever been in love?
What was she like?
A tall, beautiful blonde?
And brunette?
Well, that's silly of you to break up.
Some of my best friends have two heads.
What shall I do about Gomez?
Excellent idea.
I'll scare him.
How?
No, Cousin Itt, I think this calls for a bit more subtlety.
No.
No, nothing physical.
It should be psychological.
That's it!
I'll use psychology.
Thank you, Cousin Itt and To you.
By george, there's nothing like a pogo stick for getting around the house.
I think I'll get one for Mama.
Mama prefers a skateboard.
Mama and her dignity.
Gomez, do you know what the penalty is for bigamy?
Of course, two wives.
That's an old joke.
That's an old law book.
- I swapped with Mama for my pogo stick.
- How nice.
The family that swaps together, hops together.
- Shakespeare?
- Uncle Fester.
Oh, good old Fester.
He'd be quite a philosopher if he weren't such a bubblehead.
- How do you like my painting?
- Querida, it's marvelous.
What is it?
- Interesting.
- Do you recognize the face?
I'd recognize that face with my eyes shut.
Cousin Crimp.
Gomez, it's you.
By george, there is a resemblance.
Doesn't it send chills up your spine?
Gives me goose bumps.
I've got the perfect name for it, too.
- What?
- Joy.
I think that this is more practical.
Egad, that's disturbing news.
- It is?
- Certainly is.
"Weatherman predicts sunny skies for entire week".
Don't you notice anything else?
How can I miss?
Stock market's down four points.
You didn't see anything about a jealous wife shooting her husband?
I never read the sports page.
It's right there.
Oh, yes.
"Jealous wife shoots husband".
Very messy.
Yes, isn't it?
Poison is so much easier on the carpets.
She's probably a very sloppy housekeeper.
And a spoilsport.
As the man voted by my law class as most likely never to pass the bar, I predict that this woman will soon learn she can't go around shooting people, not without a permit.
Oh, it's no use, Cousin Itt.
Psychology didn't work at all.
No, no, definitely no shooting.
Why?
Because I have no permit.
No, no, that would absolutely ruin the carpets.
No, poison doesn't agree with him.
Pin a medal on him?
Certainly not.
I know.
I can't help it.
I am a soft-hearted Oh, thank you, Thing.
Thing, I'm going to take definite action.
I'm going to put a stop to this, no matter what the consequences to Gomez.
I can't.
I love him too much.
Did you know that Cousin Itt said that I was a I'm a double Et tu, Thing?
Oh, that must be Senor Cardona, the flamenco dancer.
I thought a little entertainment would make our guests feel at home.
Who knows?
This may become their home.
Don't worry, my dear, I have a way of getting rid of people - who begin to pall on me.
- That's what I'm afraid of.
Senor Cardona.
Senor Cardona.
Senor, we have a wonderful surprise for you.
I shall accompany you on the guitar.
How kind.
Thank you, Thing.
Much better.
I hear guitar.
Oh, Consuella, darling, come in.
Consuella Molinas, this is Senor Cardona.
What a beautiful thing.
It's just a little something I composed myself.
I mean the guitar.
May I?
Do you play?
Well, not so good like Senor Gomez, but I try.
- Exquisite.
- Not bad for a beginner.
You play, I stay.
She no play, I no stay.
She play, you stay.
- Okay?
- Olé!
Excuse me, Querida.
Wine, please.
Thank you, Thing.
Nothing like instant wine.
- Lovely evening, cara mia.
- Lovely.
To love.
A bit sweet.
Think I'll switch to champagne.
I must be alone with you.
No, no, I am promised to Gomez.
My padre kill me, kill you, kill everybody.
You know, I think I better announce the betrothal of Gomez and Consuella tonight, - right away.
- Excuse me.
You're very handy.
Morticia, Don Xavier is about to announce Gomez' engagement.
Gomez will be forced to deny it and then Don Xavier will kill him.
Oh, we can't let that happen.
Gomez is much too young to die.
He looks a lot younger than he is.
Amigos, attention.
I would like to make a toast to my future son-in-law.
I'll drink to that.
My future son-in-law But first a toast to our friends from Spain.
- I'll drink to that.
- You are most gracious.
- But I would like to make a toast to - To Consuella, a lovely flower blooming in her prime.
I'll drink to that.
Por favor, I want to drink to A toast to Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas.
A real cutie pie.
I'll drink to that.
Senora, you are most kind, but what about I'd like to propose a toast To my future son-in-law, Gomez Addams.
I'll drink to that.
- A little joke.
- It is no joke.
- No joke?
- You are engaged since you were five.
You proposed when you were five years old?
I must have been a wild one.
No propose.
Marriage contract signed in blood by Addams grandpapa and me.
But I'm already married to Morticia.
- You are married to your sister?
- Sister?
- Sí.
- Who?
- He.
- Me?
I am not his sister.
We're husband and wife.
Husband and wife?
You make insult.
- Who?
- He.
- Me?
- Sí.
Gee.
Pistols at ten paces.
But, Don Xavier, you're the best shot in all of Spain.
You're the best shot in all of Spain.
That's why I do not say swords.
No.
I will not have bloodshed in this room.
I guess we'll just have to shoot around her.
It's easy.
I expect this kind of dishonor.
Fire away.
Querido mío, what have they done to you?
Oh, isn't that sweet?
They're in love.
- Who?
- He.
- She?
- Sí!
Don Xavier, I think you're going to need this IOU.
Not me, he.
I am sorry, Don Xavier, I do not accept IOUs.
Senor, the IOU of Don Xavier Francisco de la Mancha Molinas is as good as his check post-dated.
Now, now, now, gentlemen, gentlemen, let's not quibble.
Mr. Addams and I have decided to give the young couple a gift in exactly the amount of the IOU.
Cardona, you'll have my IOU in the morning.
- In cash, dear.
- Cash it is.
Easy come, easy go.
- Senor Addams, you are true Bluebeard.
- Blueblood.
- Who?
- He.
- Me?
- Sí!
Oh, darling, wasn't it exciting last night?
Not half as exciting as this morning.
United Cannonball is rising fast and I neglected to buy a single share.
Well, it's just as well.
What would we do with all those cannonballs around the house?
Well, the children are happy at any rate.
Yes.
Just listen to them playing at their little games.
Sorry, Mama, I didn't know you were in there.
You think the children perhaps are overdoing it a bit, my dear?
Nonsense, darling.
After all, you're only young once.
Yes.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Nothing like a musical hammer.
Tish!
I've got you under the mistletoe.
Oh, for crying out loud, Gomez!
Don't you know the difference between Morticia and me?
I do now.
You're a lot softer.
You're under the mistletoe.
Can sure tell Christmas is coming around.
Everybody's getting kiss-happy.
I wrapped another present.
Oh, Uncle Fester, you did it beautifully.
It's so you.
It's a knack.
Dear Uncle Fester.
He's such a sentimental softy, but he tries to hide it.
There's plenty of room to hide it in.
Thank you, darling.
Merry Christmas.
Now, I must wrap some more Christmas packages.
Oh, darling, I want to show you.
This is for Mama.
Do you think she'll like it?
Oh!
Head of Cousin Caliban.
Beautiful!
It certainly flatters him.
I wonder if I should've had the sculptor do his other head, as well?
No, this is plenty.
Oh, darling, and this is for Lurch.
Look.
Wonderful idea!
Timesaver, too.
He can work and eat at the same time.
Also saves on dishwashing.
And this is for my sister Ophelia.
Her favorite perfume, Holiday Macabre.
Christmas present.
Oh, how jolly, Lurch!
Who is it from?
Maharaja of Manipuri.
Good old Maharaj, What did you send him this year, dear?
His weight in rubies plus a copy of the Air Force reducing diet.
Put it over there on the table, please, Lurch.
Thank you, Thing.
I can hardly wait to see what the old boy sent.
A basket!
And a flute.
And a turban.
I got it!
A headless flute player.
No, no, no, darling.
Here, let me show you.
Interesting.
You got to hand it to the Maharaja, he sure knows what to get for the man who has everything.
Let me try.
Thank you.
Everybody's a critic.
- Perhaps another piece of music, dear.
- Of course!
- What's that?
- Oh, hello, darlings.
That's a Christmas present for your father.
Don't tell us it came from Santa Claus.
And why not?
Because Mr. Thompson next door said there is no such thing as Santa Claus.
What?
That neighbor of ours isn't very neighborly telling the children that.
Remember, children, it was old Thompson who told you there weren't any witches on Halloween.
And we produced a beautiful witch for you, Aunt Singe.
- But she was a relative.
- Oh, well, that doesn't matter.
If a witch can come, so can Santa.
You mean, he's going to be here tonight?
With all his lovely reindeer.
Donder and Blitzen and Darling, what are the names of those reindeer?
Winken, Blinken and Nod?
No.
- Tom, Dick and Harry?
- No.
Well, the point is, children, there is a Santa Claus.
- Isn't there?
- Of course there is.
I hope he brings me a new Marie Antoinette doll for my guillotine.
Oh, that is fun.
A bow and arrow for me.
I'd like to shoot apples off of Uncle Fester's head.
That's a nice, clean sport.
But remember, children, be careful.
If you hit Uncle Fester's head, you can ruin the arrow.
Going to hang someone?
Pugsley, you know this tree has tradition.
It's been in the family since Gomez was a little boy.
So nice and gloomy.
Yeah, and without all those little sharp needles, it's got plenty of room for Santa to hang more presents on.
Uncle Fester, do you believe in Santa Claus?
Well, of course.
You kids are talking like children.
But Mr. Thompson said there is no Santa.
Next thing he'll be telling you is there's no dragon.
We wouldn't believe that.
Come on, Wednesday.
Thank goodness they've not been completely corrupted.
Uncle Fester, it was so good of you not to disillusion the children.
Well, gosh, I'm no crackpot.
But what if Santa doesn't show up?
After all, our children do have much more than they need.
It could destroy their faith in everything.
The astronauts have a back-up team.
We'll have a back-up Santa Claus.
- Yeah.
We'll need somebody who's fat.
- And jolly.
- Someone who knows children.
- And can talk to them on their own level.
Golly, I wish I knew somebody.
- I got it!
Lurch!
- No, he's a little too tall.
- Cousin Itt!
- A little too short.
I got just the one.
Pugsley!
No, that's no good.
- We know who.
- Who?
- You.
- Me?
Yes.
I'm going to look up costumers in the classified.
Let's see.
Cosmetics, cosmonauts Costumers!
Here we are.
Kaski's Costumes.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello?
Is this Kaski's Costumers?
This is Mrs. Addams calling.
I'd like to rent a Santa Claus costume, please.
Very well.
I'll send the subject right over.
Morticia, this is silly.
I'm not the Santa Claus type.
I'm too young and glamorous.
Do you want the children to have broken hearts?
Gomez, don't soft-soap me.
Their hearts are stronger than mine.
Of course, they are children.
And children's dreams can be shattered.
Sometimes, it can affect their whole lives.
Affect it?
It can ruin them.
That's what it'll probably do, wreck their whole lives.
Kaski's Costumers, here I come!
That's what I like about old Fester.
In a family crisis, he's always calm, cool and collected.
Perfect!
How nice and jolly it is to be trimming the tree and to have all the old family decorations.
That reminds me, shouldn't Fester be here by now?
Never fear, darling.
Uncle Fester is always dependable.
May I have another one of those balls, dear, please?
Mama's favorite.
Oh, yes, dear Mama.
She's so sentimental, she never throws anything away.
Perhaps Fester stopped by to pick up gifts for the children?
Perhaps.
That was French.
Darling, please, not on the ladder!
May I have Mama's stocking, please?
- Mama wears this?
- Only when she dresses up.
Let's see now.
There, that's perfect.
Mama always insists on having her stocking on the tree.
Well, Tish, you've done it again.
Darling.
Children!
Just in time.
Do you think Santa will really come?
Do we think Cara mia, tell them.
He should have been here over an hour ago.
Hope he doesn't get stuck in the chimney.
Pugsley, old boy, we're talking about Santa Claus, not Uncle Fester.
Good!
Come on, Pugsley!
Isn't that sweet?
They want to give Santa a warm welcome.
Deck the halls with boughs of holly Fa la la la la, la la la la 'Tis the season to be jolly Fa la la la la, la la la la Don we now our gay apparel Fa la la, fa la la, la la la Troll the ancient Yuletide carol Fa la la la la, la la la la Tish, you sing like a robin.
Gomez.
Sorry, I meant like a raven.
Now, run along upstairs, darlings, and wait for Santa to come.
Probably scouting the house for a landing right now.
I don't think Santa's going to get here tonight.
If he was, he'd be here by now.
Nonsense.
You remember Santa Claus' motto.
"Through hail or sleet or dark of night" Oh, no, that's the postman.
Well, no matter.
They both deliver things.
I don't think Santa's going to deliver anything here tonight.
Well, we better get up to bed as Mother says, or he definitely won't be here.
You never should have trusted Fester to play Santa.
You're right, Cousin Itt.
Fester is the balance wheel of the family.
He must have broken his axle somewhere.
We must get a Santa Claus for the children.
We can't let them down.
Got to get a Santa for the children.
A Santa Claus for the children.
For the children.
Turkey dinners at the mission!
How's business?
Terrible.
If things keep on like this, we're going to be serving turkey dinners without the turkey.
Well, brace up, old man.
I'm here to help.
- You mean, you want to make a donation?
- Well, in a manner of speaking.
Let's see.
That ought to be about size 42.
Forty-four, but if you're thinking of buying this suit, it's not for sale.
Of course not.
I just want to rent it for a while.
How much would you take?
Twenty-five.
That's fair enough.
Twenty-five thousand.
Mister, you don't need this suit.
Turkey dinners at the mission!
Turkey dinners at the mission!
Dear Santa, we just wanted you to know that even though Mr. Thompson said there was no such thing as Santa Claus, we didn't believe him.
So please come, or else it will make us look like dummies.
Signed Wednesday and Pugsley Addams.
- Do you see what I see?
- Santa Claus?
- Sure looks like him.
- I thought he came down the chimney.
- Maybe he took a shortcut.
- Sure answers letters fast.
I think he's trying to tell us something.
Merry Christmas, children!
Merry Christmas!
Well, well, little boy and girl, what might your names be?
- I'm Wednesday Addams.
- I'm Pugsley Addams.
Addams, eh?
One of my favorite names.
I've often thought of changing my own name to Santa Addams.
But you know tradition.
People like the Claus.
Well, this is for you, little girl.
Gee, just what I wanted.
And this is for you, young man.
- Gosh, thanks, Santa.
- Thanks, Santa.
- Thank you very much!
- Thank you very much!
Have fun, kids.
Remember, there is a Santa Claus.
Merry Christmas!
Hey, Donder!
Hey, Blitzen!
Let's get moving!
- Who's there?
- It's Santa Claus.
Oh, what a night!
Hunched up in that cramped sleigh, yelling at those lazy reindeers and trying to read addresses from 200 feet in the air.
What are you staring at?
Didn't you ever see me before?
Sure, just a minute ago, but your voice sure has changed.
You must have me mixed up with some other fellow.
Either that's Grandmama, or Santa Claus is a woman.
Either that, or Grandmama is a man.
You still think I was just here?
Well, kids are always imagining things.
Here you are.
Here you go.
And don't let your imagination run away with you.
Well, I've got to get going.
Merry Christmas!
Two dolls!
Boy, two bows and arrows!
Maybe we ought to give one of these back to some poor child.
Well, maybe, seeing as it's Christmas.
Let's go down and see if there is anything else under the tree.
Merry Christmas.
For you, Pugsley.
And Wednesday.
No thank-you for Santa?
You sure have grown.
You sure you aren't Lurch?
Santa Claus.
My imagination's running wild.
Mine, too.
Just a moment.
Come on, Wednesday.
There's something mighty peculiar going on around here.
That's Lurch.
I could tell by his smile.
Well, if they want to play, then we'll play.
Come on.
Look, Mr. Santa Claus, we think two presents are too much.
Now you give us three.
Santa gives one.
Merry Christmas.
I don't think Santa counts very well.
Santa counts fine, but I'm not so sure about Lurch.
And a Merry Christmas to you, too.
Santa?
If that isn't Cousin Itt, Santa's shrunk again.
- And a Merry Christmas to you, too, Santa.
- To you, too, Santa.
Merry Christmas!
Well, if there aren't two lovely children waiting for old Santa to arrive.
And here I am.
Look at what I've brought you.
Where did you get those lovely things?
These aren't lovely.
They aren't?
No, we're just imagining it.
Yeah, we even imagined there's a whole run on Santa Clauses.
I am the only true Santa Claus.
Oh, yeah?
Well, who's that?
- Santa Claus!
- Santa Claus!
Somebody call me?
Are you sure you're the one and only Santa?
Of course!
These two are impostors.
I shall have them removed.
You rang?
Who are you?
Never mind who he is.
Who are you?
- Who do I look like?
- You look like me.
Who are you?
Like you?
Who are you?
- Santa Claus?
- Santa Claus?
Coming!
Well Here I am, bruised, braised and fricasseed, but still on the job.
And I see all my assistants are on the job, too.
And here are your presents.
Thank you, Uncle Fester.
Uncle Fester?
Who's he?
That's you.
And that's Mother and that's Father and that's Grandma and that's Lurch and that's Cousin Itt.
The jig's up!
It was nice of you to do this, but it's too bad the real Santa never got here.
Oh, I'm sorry, darlings, but Look!
- Who's been working on the tree?
- Not me.
- Not me.
- I haven't been near it.
Nor I. Well, if it wasn't you, Cousin Itt, it must have been Snow!
But it isn't snowing outside.
By george, the real Santa must have gotten here while our backs were turned.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas!
Gomez, thank you again.
This is such a sensible Christmas gift.
The minute I saw it, I said, "That's Morticia".
Darling.
Gomez, dear, aren't you going to use the cigar lighter I gave you for Christmas?
Of course.
Best cigar lighter I ever had.
- Hi, Gomez.
- Dear Uncle Fester.
Were you able to change Pugsley's bows and arrows for a chemistry set?
Yeah.
I showed him how to use it, too.
Taught him how to mix just the right combination of sulfur, charcoal, and saltpeter.
Makes wonderful fudge.
- Fudge?
It makes gunpowder!
- Oh, don't be I could've sworn it made fudge.
- Wonderful Christmas.
- Yes, darling.
- There's only one thing missing.
- Querida, what?
That.
We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas We wish you a Merry Christmas And a Happy New Year

Are you concentrating?
Assiduously, my dear.
Gomez, if you can hear me, you are not concentrating.
Oh, sorry.
I suppose Madame Curie had days like this, too.
Let's get on with it.
Get your notebook, Uncle Fester.
Goody!
Ready.
At exactly 10:28, subject's body stiff as a board.
Subject stiff as a board.
Indicating complete mental control.
Control.
Entered final phase of Addams experiment to prove that the human mind can triumph over the law of gravity.
Gravity.
Positions, please.
Now remember, we must pull together.
Watch for the signal.
Now!
That gravity's a tough one.
Darling, are you positive you were concentrating?
Certainly.
Did it work?
Not quite.
You were doing fine until you hit the floor.
Hey, that's easy.
We could just lower the floor.
I think Fester's got something there.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh, it's for you, darling.
I wonder what that is?
My new mark seven, custom-built, grand prix croquet mallet.
I stole it for $200.
Thank you, Thing.
Occupant.
Occupant.
Occupant.
Occupant.
So nice to be remembered.
Oh, Uncle Fester.
Here's one for you, dear.
It's from her.
Diana Delf.
Uncle Fester, what's come over you?
She sent it to me, personally.
I've been writing to her for months.
Ever since I saw her in the show.
Just a moment, you'd better let me do it.
You'll tear it.
- Oh, it's a picture!
- Oh, me first.
It's her!
It's her!
Let me see, Uncle Fester, let me see.
Oh, by george, she's a dazzler.
Boy, I gotta get right upstairs and write her an answer.
Oh, my Diana!
He's Addams all the way.
Can't resist a pretty face.
Now, if you'll observe, my dear, croquet is a combination of two things.
Balance, timing, peripheral vision, superb coordination and a killer's instinct.
- Your shot, my dear.
- Oh.
Gomez, I'm worried.
Querida, you've forgotten everything I've taught you.
Sorry, darling.
Congratulate me, everybody.
Congratulations!
That is wonderful.
What happened?
I'm gonna get married.
I just proposed to the sweetest little girl in the entire world.
Oh, well, that's very sweet, Uncle Fester.
But can you support a wife?
Oh, details, details.
Gomez, can you see your way clear to advance me a nickel for a postage stamp?
No, but I can give you a check.
Oh, well, while you're making it out, make it for, say, even 10,000.
- For stamps?
- Well, no, you know, incidentals like the minister, the marriage license, rice, - attorney.
- Attorney?
- I may get divorced.
- Divorced?
You know, be prepared.
I remember that from when I was a scout.
There must be something wrong with this carpet.
Well, where's the checkbook?
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Uncle Fester, just a moment.
You've never even met this girl.
You run a great risk of ruining your life and hers, as well.
Good thinking, my dear.
Then I don't get the check?
Maybe next time.
Oh, okay.
I'll send it COD.
Oh, Gomez, it's breaking my heart.
Mine, too.
This mallet isn't worth a plugged nickel.
Darling, I was referring to Uncle Fester and that girl.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Well, I suppose her parents must be as upset as we are.
- I'm sure they would be, if they were here.
- But they're not.
But they could be.
At least, her mother could be.
And she doesn't even have to make the trip.
Querida, I do believe you're up to some mischief.
Yes.
What do you think?
Do you think I'll fool Uncle Fester?
- You can fool me.
- Oh, mon cher.
But not when you speak French.
Darling, please, my make-up.
Yes, make-up.
Nothing wrong with that mallet.
Diana's mama.
Mother!
Just looking at you makes me feel like I've known you for a long time.
Too long.
Say, where's what's her name, your daughter?
Just a minute.
I've got a few questions to ask you.
Sit down.
How much money have you got?
Well, that's hard to say.
What's your salary?
That's hard to say, too.
I'll give you something easy to say.
What do you do?
I hang around.
I help my nephew play with the trains and I shoot off the cannon.
And I clean out the alligator's nest.
I sit in my tree, you know.
I know.
You're one of those stage-door johnnies.
Mother, you're acting very suspicious.
I got a little suspicious when I had to pay five cents postage due on your proposal to my daughter.
You owe me a nickel.
You need it all at once?
For what?
'Cause I'm kind of strapped right now.
Forget it!
Just forget the whole thing.
And forget my daughter, too.
She's gonna marry a man that can support her.
All right!
All right, if that's what it takes.
I'll get her, you'll see.
I'll be a big success.
I'll throw gold and diamonds right at your daughter's feet.
I warn you, she's got very big feet.
"Prospectors, send $1 for guaranteed treasure map.
"Raise mink in your own home".
No, that's no good.
"We can release the hidden power within you.
"Let us set your feet on the road to fame and fortune.
"Complete correspondence course from the Greer Business College".
That's it!
Sweetheart, you'll be proud of me yet.
I'll throw diamonds and rubies at your big feet.
Now that you've completed your entire course, you may consider yourself a graduate of the Greer Business College of Correspondence.
A few weeks ago, you entered this institution a slack- jawed, glassy-eyed jellyfish.
But today, by following our teaching, you have unlocked your potential, transformed yourself into dynamic, hard-hitting executive material.
You've already chosen your first target.
Hit it hard.
Now, the world is your oyster.
Goody!
I like oysters.
You have a date with destiny.
Fester Gomez, this is the most beautiful moment of my whole life.
I can't wait for my first class reunion.
Now, Fester, this job nonsense has gone far enough.
Oh, careful there, Gomez.
You're talking to a dynamic, hard-hitting executive.
- Really, Fester - Sir to you.
And look at you.
Just look at yourself.
Take inventory.
That ridiculous suit.
Those preposterous high-button shoes.
No class.
No style.
No appeal.
Things that I have always had.
Really, Fester, I Now, look, I'll do the thinking around here and do you know why?
Because I used to be a slack-jawed, glassy-eyed jellyfish, just like you.
But I unlocked my potential.
I became a new man.
Hey, Gomez, I may even change my name.
- Fester, what - I'm sorry, I'm very busy.
Busy doing what?
Well, I'll think of something.
Good day, sir.
- Well?
- It's worse than we thought.
- What did he say?
- He said my shoes were preposterous.
Well, they do need polishing.
That I was a glassy-eyed, slacked-jawed jellyfish.
I better think up an answer to that.
I hear it fairly often.
That's nonsense.
I'm going to demand an apology.
There you are.
Uncle Fester, I think you and I had better have a talk.
Oh, sorry, a big day.
First stop, Thaddeus P. Logan.
Big business tycoon.
- Do you have an appointment with him?
- No, but I think I can sandwich him in.
Uncle Fester, wouldn't you rather sit up in your tree house?
- My tree house.
- It's more you.
That's true.
But I owe it to my beautiful Diana to be a big wheel.
And I am.
It said so on the record.
Uncle Fester, how would you like a nice new cannon?
- A new cannon?
- Come with me.
Right over here.
Tish, that's French.
Darling, please.
Let's concentrate on Uncle Fester's problem.
Oh, yes.
Yes, Uncle Fester's problem.
But I'm next.
Fester, give up all this big business nonsense and the cannon is yours.
You make it very difficult for me, Gomez.
I love Diana.
I dream of running barefoot through her beard.
Fester, you mean you'd give all this up for a woman?
That's kid's stuff.
You rang?
No, but, Lurch, you can get the car out.
I have a date with a very important oyster.
Well, I tell you, J.D., I'll let you have the whole 20,000 shares at $50 a share.
You'll pay $25?
What are you trying to do, J.D., ruin me?
Those shares are worth 50 if they're worth a penny.
It's 50 or nothing.
- What the - Play it cool, he'll call back.
Who the devil are you?
Let's face it, J.D., you need a man like me.
I'm magnetic.
I'm hard-hitting!
Hello.
J. D?
You will pay 50?
It's a deal.
Will you have a cigar?
Thank you, sir.
Well, good evening, Morticia, Gomez.
Uncle Fester, dear.
- Boy, am I bushed.
- Now, look, Fester Sorry, I'm busy.
Working on a $15 million deal.
You better make that $20 million.
I hate odd numbers.
- $20 million.
The poor dear's sick.
- We'd better get a psychiatrist.
I'll look up one in the classified.
Maybe he can explain this, too.
Now, look, Logan.
You may be the boss, but if you want to talk to me you will have to come over here.
- All right, all right.
I'll come over there.
- Now that's better.
Now, let me see, where was I?
Oh, yes.
You rang?
Lurch, I'm in the midst of a big institutional deal and I misplaced a telephone number.
It was on the back of a laundry ticket.
Oh, you didn't see it, huh?
I think I remember it.
Let's see.
Five, five.
Five, five.
Five, five, five.
Hello?
Hello!
What?
I don't like that merger deal.
You don't like it?
Who asked you?
Nobody asked me, I'm telling you, smart guy.
Oh, so now I'm a smart guy, huh?
Well, you listen No, you listen.
The deal's off!
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can say that again!
You can't let these fellows push you around.
Cybernetics, Cyclops, psychiatrist.
Thank you, Thing.
Here's one.
"Dr. Brown.
"Psychiatric service, 24 hours a day.
"House calls and all credit cards honored".
Sounds like our man.
Dr. Brown speaking.
Yes?
It all started when Uncle Fester fell in love with this girl with a stunning blond beard.
Blond beard?
A real blond beard?
Well, personally, I'm sure she touches it up a little.
And when we wouldn't give him a postage stamp, he went to pieces.
Your Uncle Fester sounds at loose ends.
Oh, he's very loose, and he needs help immediately.
When I come to call, he shouldn't know that I'm a psychiatrist.
It'll be best if you don't call me doctor.
I'll use some other name.
Is that agreeable?
Perfectly.
We'll be waiting for you, Doc Sir.
Goodbye.
A real beard?
Thank you, Thing.
Darling, the psychiatrist insists that we not call him doctor for fear of upsetting Uncle Fester.
Good idea.
We'll tell Fester he's the plumber.
- Sir.
- I'm Gomez Addams, Fester's nephew.
- Well, I'm Mr. Logan.
Thaddeus Logan.
- Logan, huh?
Well, that's as good a name as any.
Come right in, Mr. Logan.
We've been expecting you.
Querida, this is Mr. Logan.
Mr. Logan, this is my lovely wife, Morticia.
Oh, Mr. Logan.
How do you do?
- Fester lives here?
- Oh, yes.
Won't you please sit down?
There are a few things we think you ought to know about Uncle Fester.
Oh?
Well, I know all I need to know.
By thunder, I admire your confidence.
Lightning quick.
Yes, it eases my mind to know that you'll be with him in his time of trouble.
Oh, well, I don't anticipate any trouble.
No, I got all the papers right here, ready to sign.
Oh, we'll have those institutions eating out of our hand.
Institution?
Oh, no, we couldn't send him to an institution.
No need, sir, he's an Addams, and we look after our own.
Besides, the poor dear isn't violent.
What are you talking about?
I think you should know what made Uncle Fester crack up.
Fester?
Crack up?
Completely off his trolley.
Keeps talking about big business deals and mergers and that once fine mind has been reduced to a shambles.
Oh, well, I know what you mean.
Yeah, I often feel like I'm cracking up.
You look it.
But if what you say is true Why, it's ghastly.
- Ghastly.
- Ghastly.
Now I get it.
You, in these funny shoes and that preposterous suit.
This is all a gag, isn't it?
Yeah.
Fester put you up to this, didn't he?
Very amusing.
I think the doctor could use some help himself.
I guess he finally has cracked up.
What is this all about?
Oh, the children persuaded me to light up and ride my cycle around.
Just for old times' sake.
We love to watch him ride his motorcycle in the house.
And wrestle the alligator.
Wrestle the alligator?
A live alligator?
Not very sporting, wrestling a dead one.
And I can beat Thing at Indian wrestling, too.
Thing?
Who is Thing?
Thing?
Come up and say hello to Mr. Logan.
Oh, no.
I've got to get out of here.
Hey, just a minute.
Come back here!
What happened?
Where's he going?
Back to the mental clinic, where else?
Mental clinic?
We weren't supposed to tell you, but that's where he's from.
Well, I'll be darned.
You never know, do you?
I could tell the minute he walked in.
Well, it wasn't much fun.
Fun?
It only goes to show how dangerous working can be.
That's right.
Well, ho-hum.
Don't worry, my dear.
That glass is unbreakable.
Cleopatra, please, dear.
Think of all the less-fortunate African stranglers.
That's my good, good girl.
Boy, that's real musical milk.
Yes, baby.
Man.
Show him in, Lurch.
That's my sweet girl.
Yes.
Which one of them is disturbed?
Oh, it was Uncle Fester, right there.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I can see he needs help immediately.
- Who are you, old man?
- You know.
Is he violent?
We gonna have trouble getting him into the clinic?
Oh, Dr. Logan sent you.
You can tell Dr. Logan it won't be necessary.
He's completely recovered.
He snapped right out of it.
As you can see, he's completely normal.
Normal?
Sorry to get you out here on a false alarm, old man, but as you can see everything's right as rain at the Addams house.
You fire us a bill along anyway and better luck next time.
And do tell Dr. Logan I said he needs a long rest.
- So do I. - You rang?
Lurch, show the gentleman out, please.
Good night.
Doctors.
Such a strange breed.
I'm so glad you didn't crack up over Diana.
Diana?
Who's Diana?
That ravishing creature you were going to marry.
Oh, yeah.
I guess she'd sort of slipped my mind.
Well, I guess it's for the best.
After all, she's a woman and I'm a man.
What do we got in common?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Thank you, Thing.
Not bad for a beginner.
Look who my teacher is.
That's true!
But remember in the future, my dear, follow through!
Follow through!
Mother, can we go out and play?
In this weather?
With all that blue sky and sunshine?
We've been in for two weeks now.
And there's nothing left to do.
I know just the thing!
How would you children like to come down to the moat and watch me wrestle with the alligator?
- In the quicksand.
- In the quicksand?
Oh, goody!
Oh, yes!
I see what I've been doing wrong.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
- Gomez.
- Yes, my dear.
I'm concerned about the children.
I know!
But every silver lining has its cloud.
And with all of us cooped up here on account of the elements, it's bound to get a bit sticky.
Oh, no, darling.
That isn't exactly what I meant.
You know, I thought Uncle Fester was spoiling them, but Mama is even worse.
She lets them sit on her back in the morning when she does her pushups, she's told them where I keep the yak fudge, and I know she's letting Pugsley sleep with his tarantula.
I'm going to speak to her!
But gently, Morticia, gently.
Of course.
I threw him in 12 seconds flat.
And she's gonna do it again this afternoon.
With one hand tied.
Mama, that's the fourth time this week.
Don't worry.
I'm in good shape.
I'm gonna work out again on my trampoline.
It's the children we're concerned about, Mama.
You probably don't realize it, but you're being much too indulgent.
Besides, you're wearing out the poor alligator.
And you're shedding crocodile tears.
Pish tosh!
And I think she means it.
Oh, blue skies again!
Oh, those dreadful petals getting larger and larger, and my poor thorns just wilting away.
Great game, polo!
I may donate a field to the orphanage.
On your way, Kelso.
Good shot, darling.
The door.
Sounds like a wild beast.
Optimist!
Whoa!
Gomez, is it really you?
Maybe not.
I haven't been myself lately.
Morticia!
Thank you.
Am I really home?
Doesn't it look like it, dear?
I don't know.
Those blue skies, all that sunshine.
It's done something to my mind.
I thought I was home twice already this afternoon.
Both times it turned out to be a mirage.
Whee!
Thank goodness.
This time it's real.
Mama just can't seem to stay on that trampoline.
Uncle Fester, what ever possessed you to go out on a day like this?
I had no choice.
There wasn't a single stick left in the whole house.
And you know they don't deliver on weekends.
Couldn't it have waited till Monday?
What?
Wait three whole days without an explosion?
How are you going to explain that to a child?
Uncle Fester, don't you think you've been indulging them a bit too much?
Fester, my parents were rich, but when I was a boy, I sold newspapers, collected bottles, scrimped and saved my kopeks, so that I could buy one single stick of 40% nitro.
Now, that's how you build character.
But it makes them so happy.
Uncle Fester, a happy child is merely an unhappy child who's having fun.
For their sakes, I'll take care of this for a while.
But that's my dynamite.
I paid for it with my blood, sweat, and my alligator egg money.
Uncle Fester, please try and understand.
We don't want you and Mama spoiling the children.
Well, I don't call the bare necessities of life spoiling them.
All right.
I'll be up in my closet sulking.
Kind of dark in there.
I don't think we were unreasonable.
Do you?
Oh, of course not, darling.
You know he loves to pout.
It keeps his battery charged.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch.
Would you Darling.
Where should we store Uncle Fester's dynamite?
That little shelf right above the furnace should be perfect.
As for the weather, this part of the country will remain unchanged.
- Fair.
- Clear.
- Sunny.
- Maddening!
Meanwhile, the Gulf Coast states are bracing themselves for the arrival of hurricane Zsa Zsa.
Hurricane Zsa Zsa.
Oh, Gomez.
It makes me go all tingly all over just to think about it.
If we hurry, we can drive down and catch it.
Divine.
Oh, no.
It isn't.
Darling, we can't go.
The children are in school.
And we couldn't leave them with Uncle Fester and Mama.
It would be such an imposition.
True.
We won't have to.
I'll engage a governess.
You're always at your best in a crisis.
You're so inspiring.
That's what they said about Old Ebenezer Addams.
When he led the early settlers across the great plains?
When he sold the first guns to the Indians.
He really was a pioneer.
I'm going to engage a governess.
This is Mrs. Addams, over on Cemetery Ridge.
I'd like to engage a governess for a week or two.
Oh?
Just a moment.
They have a Miss Thudd.
She speaks Choctaw like a native and holds a white hunter's license.
Sounds like a gem.
Miss Thudd will be acceptable.
A hundred dollars?
Sounds like a steal.
A hundred dollars seems a bit high.
After all, we do have a butler to take care of the alligator in the basement.
Yes.
Alligator.
All she'd have to do is supervise the children and a few African stranglers.
She'd see that their food is well cooked and that they brush after every meal.
No, not the children, the stranglers.
Two hundred dollars?
Very well, we'll take it.
I kept her from going to three.
That's what I call horse trading.
Zsa Zsa, here we come.
One thing about traveling light, it doesn't take you long to pack.
Tish.
You sentimental little dickens.
I wore it at our first hurricane.
They'll be gone a whole week.
It shows that they really do count on us.
I fixed them a snack for the road.
You better take it to them before it stiffens.
That's beautiful.
You know what?
I like it the way they trust us with the children.
It gets me right here.
Oh?
Oh?
Oh.
Well, thank you very much for calling.
Gomez.
The governess can't be here until tomorrow.
Oh, well.
We'll just have to miss the first day of the big blow.
If you've seen them sandbag one lobby, you've seen them all.
I don't like the sound of that cough.
And we don't like the sound of what Lurch just told us.
Yeah, the truth is finally out.
You don't trust us with the children.
You think we're too feeble and too old and too unreliable.
And too shiftless and too low-down and too uncouth and - Fester!
- I was carried away.
Oh, my dears, we simply didn't want to burden you with the responsibility.
See?
You heard it from her own lips.
- We're not responsible.
- Don't be foolish.
Now we're foolish, too.
Let's clear out.
All right, we're gonna go pack up our money and my light bulb.
Gomez, darling, stop them.
Don't worry, my dear.
They're obviously bluffing about leaving.
They're merely children, and from time to time, need mature, sensible guidance.
We're not helpless.
Imagine a governess in our house.
Fester!
You know the combination of that safe.
How many times do I have to tell you?
It's so much more fun cracking it.
My.
The things that come out of a nest egg!
That little fellow must be hungry.
Fester, I just remembered.
There's no money in there.
Something better than money.
The great Star of the East.
Oh, yes!
The sacred ruby that Great-Grandfather Blob pried from the head of the Hindu idol.
Not pried from the head of a Hindu idol, pried from the head of a Hindu.
It was giving him a terrible headache, and he was so relieved, he gave Great-Grandpapa a present of the ruby.
Gone.
- Burglars?
- Couldn't be.
Why would they take just that and leave the rest of these valuables?
Let me take a peek.
Remember?
Oh, yeah!
That cat that yowled half the night.
Well, it was the only rock in the house.
That's that.
Now we gotta stay home.
We'll do the next best thing.
Now, they'll stay on their side and, since we're not needed, we'll stay over here.
One thing, this whole business is so outlandish, it can't last.
We'll keep it just this way from now on.
I should have thought of this 20 years ago.
Well, we might as well have lunch.
You rang?
Hey, here's a hot one.
Good-as-new rickshaw, never been on a freeway, only $98.
See Slippery Sam, the honest Chinaman.
I'd have to see that first.
- We got gypped the last time.
- Yeah.
Oh, Lurch.
Ask Mr. Addams if I can see the sports page please.
And if Mrs. Addams doesn't mind, I'd like fashions.
Sports page.
See if you can get the want ads.
That rickshaw sounds like a steal.
Lurch, I'd like theater and arts when Mama is through.
- I heard him.
- I did, too.
Thank you, Lurch.
Thank you.
By george!
Here's an interesting want ad.
The ladies skirts will be longer this year.
Lurch, you gave me the sports page.
And I've got finance.
Yeah, and I'm stuck with the news.
I got finance again.
He gave me the society page.
Schwarzkopf pitches no-hitter!
Not bad for a rickshaw boy.
Am I back to sports again?
Appears to be.
I'm in want ads.
Lurch, you gave me real estate.
And I certainly don't need beauty hints.
Oh, that must be the new governess.
Better answer the door, Lurch.
I am the new governess.
Follow me.
That throat needs tending.
Definitely!
Wait here.
Ah, Miss Thudd.
Just call me Thudd.
We hope you'll like it here, Thudd.
I like the house.
It is nice and homey, isn't it?
Cheerful, too.
I think it would be even cheerier if we put up a few more family pictures.
Oh, darling, it would be too much with that.
Oh, of course.
Cousin Nanook's family.
Won't you sit down?
I prefer to stand.
Ah, children.
This is Wednesday and Pugsley, our children.
Darlings, this is your new governess, Thudd.
My guillotine's busted.
"Broken," not "busted".
Well, either way, we can't make it work.
You must think positively.
Keep repeating firmly to yourself, "My guillotine will work.
My guillotine will work.
"My guillotine will work".
I like her attitude.
She's our kind of people.
Well, you're in complete charge, Thudd.
Follow me.
Run along, children.
Have fun!
Did you ever see happier expressions on children's faces?
Thudd does have winning ways.
We refuse to remain under the same roof with her.
Right.
We're leaving.
But you haven't any money.
We have something better than money.
We have the old Addams ingenuity.
I can get a job as carhop.
Or, better still, an airline hostess.
And I can always go back to testing skateboards or I may take a whack at brain surgery.
Come, Mama, the world is waiting.
They may be naive and misguided but, by Jove, they're glorious.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch, please put our luggage in the car.
Every now and then, there's a bear gets in here.
Mean devil.
Well, who knows?
We may have an indoor hurricane.
Oh, Gomez, it's exactly as I remembered it.
Divine.
You're the first customers we've had here since you was here two years ago.
Gomez, darling.
Look!
So, that's where you left it.
I'm coming to think there's something wrong with this place.
Maybe the location.
Nonsense.
The location is ideal.
Why, the vinegar works are over there, glue factory is right behind you.
Gomez, darling.
That thunder is like music to my ears.
Folks, we're trying a new policy.
Free Continental breakfast.
Obviously catering to the jet set.
Nope, we got to use up the eggs.
A flock of hens been nesting in number six.
Here's your key.
Oh, one other little thing.
Watch out for the badger trap under the bed.
What a divine touch.
Stick with me, Tish.
First class, all the way.
Morticia!
You, a night, and a swamp.
Gomez, darling.
Why don't we get into something more comfortable?
Capital suggestion!
Fair warning, querida.
I'm coming out with that new cologne, Deadwood number five.
Gomez.
Gomez, come here, quick.
Quickly.
Quickly!
Hurry!
Hurry, Gomez!
Oh, no, no, no, darling.
The suitcase.
Look.
Thudd's!
Lurch obviously gave me this one by mistake.
Certainly looks that way.
Vitamins?
This Thudd seems more like a dud.
Look at this.
Mother Goose, and Sugar plums.
Oatmeal cookies, lollypops An apple.
That women's a fraud.
Well, she can't be all bad.
Really?
Reading Dr. Spock?
Oh, I thought it was Dr. Spook.
Gomez, how could we have been taken in by a pretty face and a little charm.
- We must go back.
- Let's hope we're not too late.
- Lurch!
- Lurch, open up.
Oh, dear.
Lurch, is everything all right?
Wednesday?
Pugsley?
Children?
Pugsley?
Wednesday?
Lurch, what happened?
Oh, dear!
Gomez.
Gomez, I'm afraid we're too late.
Better let me check first, my dear.
So The honeymooners are back.
Did you enjoy your hurricane?
Fester, Mama.
What are you doing here?
- Our duty.
- Unlike some people I know.
We couldn't leave the children in the hands of that fiend.
So, we swallowed our pride, came back and fired her.
I think she's on her way to join the Peace Corps.
Thank goodness!
Well, since we are not needed here, I can just about make the swing shift at the skateboard factory.
I have to get back to the drive-in.
Uncle Fester, Mama, please stay.
We love you and the children need you.
Besides, the old place wouldn't be the same without you.
Well, I'll stay, but on one condition.
The sky's the limit.
I'm a grown man.
And a fine, intelligent one.
I can't be treated like a child.
No grown man should be treated like a child.
So, I want my dynamite back.
That's a deal.
Goody.
For a moment there, I thought he was gonna ask for something silly.
Something silly?
Uncle Fester?
Oh, it's such a comfort to know that the children are back in good hands.
- Cara.
- Darling.
- Good shot, Thing.
- Good shot, Thing.
It's wonderful having everybody back together again, isn't it?
Yes, but I am a little sorry about missing hurricane Zsa Zsa.
Zsa Zsa!
Everybody outside.
You and I can go up to the attic.
The attic?
I know how sentimental you are about the Last Chance Motel.
I tore a big hole in the roof.

They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Tish!
That sets my Spanish blood aflame.
Bubele, please.
Bubele.
That sets the rest of my blood aflame.
One, two, fat go away.
Three, four, muscles stay.
Pugsley, darling, what are you doing?
Exercising.
She called me fatso.
She?
My girl, Marie.
She said she wasn't going to go with me anymore unless I got some muscles.
Muscles?
Oh, how vulgar.
Morticia, Gomez.
Hey, Morticia, Gomez.
What do you know, I just got a letter from my French pen pal, Yvette.
- And she says - Uncle Fester.
Please, dear, not now.
Later.
We have a little problem.
We caught the boy exercising.
Well, what's wrong with that?
Girls like guys with V-figures.
The only trouble is, mine's upside-down.
Now, Pugsley, dear, a man's charm comes from inner strength.
Not from outer bulges.
Look at your father, did you ever see a better example of inner strength?
And the whole thing without a single push-up, pull-up, sit-up, sweat-up.
The entire thing accomplished through the sheer glory of Zen-Yogi.
Zen-Yogi has made your father what he is today.
That plus the sheer beauty of his soul.
Darling.
Let's have no more talk of biceps and triceps.
If you want to be a really attractive man, do as your father does.
Okay, Mother, I'll try.
Darling.
Oh, just look at him.
Gaining inner strength.
Inner strength and a flat head.
Fester, don't knock anything until you've really tried it.
How true, darling.
Now, Uncle Fester, your letter from Yvette.
Oh, forget it.
Gomez, darling, did you hear something?
Just a thump.
Seems to be coming from Fester's room.
I wonder what he's up to.
He'll be coming through the ceiling in a minute, we can ask him.
I have a better idea.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch.
Would you go upstairs and check on Uncle Fester?
There seems to be a lot of thumping going on up there.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
You thumped.
Oh, Lurch.
I'm in terrible shape.
So I see.
Remember my French pen pal, Yvette?
Folies-Bergere.
She's coming here to visit me.
You can say that again.
She thinks that I'm 6'3" and built like Cary Grant.
Well, it's not that bad.
I've got a couple of days to get in shape.
But Zen-Yogi isn't gonna do it.
Corset?
Corset!
'Course not.
No.
I'm gonna go on a crash program of diet and exercise, but secret.
- Secret?
- Yeah.
You know how Gomez and Morticia feel about exercise.
They think it's silly.
I'll have to do it early in the morning.
Hey, I'll do it with that guy on TV, Jack La Lanne.
The muscle man.
He's on at 6:50 in the morning.
What are you moaning about?
I'm the one that's gotta get up and do it!
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Come on, ladies, hit it.
One, two, three, four.
One Tummies in.
Shoulders back, squat.
Hit it.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
Come on, one, two, - three, four - What is he doing?
He's either dancing to The Late Late Show or exercising to The Early Early Show.
One, two, three, four.
Hi.
Isn't that Jack La Lanne, the physical culture fellow?
Never heard of him.
Gomez.
That television set goes back to the junk man.
Good thinking.
Hey.
I can't get you on TV anymore, so I decided on a personal approach.
I need help.
You know, you said it was an emergency and it certainly is.
You know, I've seen people let themselves go.
But you're almost gone.
Touché!
Morticia.
Isn't that that television fellow with Uncle Fester?
I do believe it is.
That's odd having him here.
Fester's up to something.
Darling, have you ever known Uncle Fester to be sneaky and underhanded?
Only when he was up to something shady.
Say, what do you generally eat?
Oh, the usual thing.
Eye of newt.
Purée of aardvark.
Roast yak.
You know, they say we're what we eat.
And, mister, you really are.
Look, it's all in this booklet.
This is the astronaut's guide.
And whatever it calls for in here goes double for you.
Roger.
Four, three, two, one.
Blast off.
Boy, this exercise makes you thirsty.
Turn it off!
Well, now.
A little punching the bag.
Well, I've stopped punching the bag.
Now, what's the next exercise in that astronaut book that La Lanne gave me?
Deep knee-bends.
Deep knee-bends.
All right, you count.
We'll start with about 50.
One.
Down.
More.
I got down all right.
You've got to get me up.
Oh, boy.
Listen to those muscles expand.
Well.
That's enough deep knee-bends.
What's the next exercise?
Chest pulley.
That will be a snap.
Thank you.
Must be stuck.
Yeah.
I think I got the hang of it now.
Sure.
Well, don't just stand there, help me.
Now I got the idea.
Let me have it.
My, he was in a hurry.
Lurch, we know we can count on you.
What's troubling Fester?
I think he's trying to tell us something.
Is he in trouble?
He's beginning to weaken.
Is it a money matter?
An emotional disturbance?
A health problem?
We're getting warm.
A health problem.
Darling, you're right.
Uncle Fester's ill.
Of course, that's it.
It's written all over his face.
Just had to keep probing.
Thank you, Lurch.
Thank you for being so helpful.
Uncle Fester, what are you doing?
Relaxing.
Fester, old boy.
Your problem is solved.
It is?
Yes, we're going to have a doctor here for you in an hour.
- This is the Addams house?
- Yep.
You're going in there?
Good luck, Charlie.
I'm Doctor Motley.
Follow me.
Doctor Motley.
Just a moment, Doctor, where are you going?
I am going to nail up a quarantine sign.
I can tell just by looking at you, there's an epidemic in this house.
Really, Doctor, there's no need for hysterics.
Only one of us is sick.
- Which one?
- Uncle Fester, of course.
Just hasn't been himself.
Oh, I'm not sick.
I just had a complete physical examination.
Blood pressure, perfect.
Pulse, perfect.
Reaction time, perfect.
Liver, so-so.
So-so?
Well, you can't win them all.
Who performed this examination?
I did.
It may not be perfect, but it saves a lot of time.
Fester, where are you going?
Up to my room to sharpen my scalpel.
- Your scalpel?
- Yes.
If my liver count keeps dropping, I may have to operate.
Uncle Fester.
As long as Doctor Motley is here, how about an examination?
Oh.
Need the practice, hey, Doc?
If it weren't for my Hippocratic oath, I'd turn in my satchel.
You see anything, Doctor?
Yes, I see a face with pince-nez glasses.
Fester's head?
Either in or Let's try it from another angle.
Do you still see that face, Doctor?
No, now I see a moose's head.
By george, Fester always did like to keep an open mind.
You know what I think?
Don't tell me you think he has holes in his head.
I think you all have holes in your head.
And that includes me.
Poor fellow.
Those long internships do take their toll.
Poor Uncle Fester.
How a man can go to pieces right before your very eyes.
Not only did he pass up lunch and dinner, but look at him.
Staring at the full moon and doing deep knee-bends.
Oh, dear, he is sick.
Usually when the moon is full, he howls at it.
Darling.
You don't suppose his problem could be mental.
Possible.
Greater minds than his have been known to crack.
Remember Cousin Slump?
Yes.
One moment, a brilliant nuclear physicist.
The next, he was running around Los Alamos in a three-cornered hat and a powdered wig.
Dear.
Darling, perhaps I should call a psychiatrist?
Querida, after our experience with Dr. Motley?
You're right.
I'll handle this myself.
Do you remember how much I helped you with your sleepwalking?
You mean to analyze him?
We must reach his subconscious.
Be lucky to reach his conscious.
Darling, we have to try and help him.
But how?
There are ways.
Now, Uncle Fester.
I want you to concentrate.
Concentrate.
Concentrate.
Morticia, you're just wasting your time.
The only one that can hypnotize me is me.
Now, watch.
Sleep.
Certainly doesn't waste time on preliminaries.
Yes, but I think we ought to make sure he's really out.
Test his reflexes.
- Reflexes?
- Yeah.
With a hammer, you know.
Oh!
Oh, of course.
By george, he's really under.
Now, Uncle Fester.
I want you to listen very carefully.
First question.
You've been up to something lately, haven't you?
Yes.
- Would you care to tell us about it?
- No.
Uncle Fester.
Tell us.
What's going through your poor tortured mind at this very moment?
Four, three, two, one.
Blast off!
So that's it.
What's it?
We know now why Uncle Fester has been doing - all this ridiculous exercising and dieting.
- We do?
Of course.
He wants to become an astronaut.
That's wonderful, the first Addams in space.
A proud moment, isn't it?
No, it isn't.
We can't let him go.
- Why not?
- He's DC.
District of Columbia?
Direct current.
Put DC Fester in the AC space capsule, and Nothing left of Fester but a plump asteroid.
How courageous.
Willing to blow himself for science.
A true Addams.
He'd set the space program back 20 years.
We must save him from his brave folly.
- But first we better wake him up.
- Oh, yes.
Uncle Fester?
Uncle Fester.
Oh, what we do now?
- You're gonna hit him with that?
- Most certainly not, dear.
Oh, how horrible.
I dreamed I was swimming the English Channel and halfway across I sank.
No use trying to conceal it.
I need more exercises.
Hello, Houston?
This is Morticia Addams and I'd like to speak to the head of your astronaut program.
He's asleep?
Well, wake him, wake him.
This is a citizen calling.
If he could see you in all your loveliness, he'd pop out of bed in a minute.
Hello?
Hello, General.
This is Morticia Addams.
Now, I don't mean to be critical, but I do think you're going a bit far in drafting Uncle Fester for your next Gemini shot.
Well, not that he isn't willing to go, of course.
But we do feel Yes.
Yes, I do know you have a moon shot in the morning.
But that's no reason to lure plump, happy earthlings like Uncle Fester away.
Now, now, now.
General.
That kind of language will not solve any problem.
I General?
What did he say?
I think the phone went dead.
Morticia.
Look.
Good heavens!
The General's language must have burned up the phone wires.
Things have come to a pretty pass when a man can't have any privacy in his own steam cabinet.
Uncle Fester, you can stop this ridiculous exercising.
You've been released from the astronaut program.
What astronaut program?
Ours, of course.
Unless you sold out to the Russians.
Boy, are you off-base.
I'm doing this for my pen pal, Yvette.
Exercising for a pen pal?
Sure.
She's from the Folies-Bergere.
And she's gonna come over here and visit me.
And when she gets here, I'm gonna be real trim and sexy.
Miss Yvette.
Already?
Oh, she can't see me like this.
Nonsense.
Fester, old man, you have to go upstairs and face the music.
Oh, not with this body.
Perhaps she'll love you for your soul.
Well, that's even fatter.
Come on.
Lurch.
Where's our visitor from overseas?
In the conservatory.
Oh, please show her in.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
You know, Morticia, when she sees me, a great postal romance is going right down the drain.
Brace up, Uncle Fester.
She'll love you for what you are.
All of it.
Yvette?
Of course, chéri, and you must be Fester.
What an interesting couple.
They're almost an interesting quartet.
But I thought you were with the Folies-Bergere.
I am, I take care of the costumes.
Oh, no wonder she's putting on weight.
If she takes care of the costumes at the Folies-Bergere, she doesn't have much to do.
In your letter to me, you said to go on a diet.
Of course, chéri.
But to gain weight, not to lose it.
You are nothing but skin and bones.
Not my type at all.
Yvette, you spoke French!
Of course, chéri.
What do you expect from a French girl, Hungarian?
That's an interesting point.
Well, I must hurry, my cab is waiting.
Keep writing, chéri.
Well, if you can't believe in the Folies-Bergere, what's left for a fella?
Well, one good thing, Fester, now you can stop all that ridiculous exercise and dieting.
Take my advice.
Put your money on Zen-Yogi.
Hey!
I did it.
Well, how handsome you both look.
As Grandpa Squint Addams used to say about Cousin Blob, two heads are better than one.
That junk man, really a gem, offering me money to take the set back.
I'm glad it's back.
These moon shots are so exciting.
Yes.
They do stir up the old corpuscles.
Darling, that missile.
Why is its tail wagging?
Oh, I hate to tell you this, querida, but you've tuned in on Rin Tin Tin.
There.
That's it.
Fester, is anything wrong?
Need a little recharging, that's all.
What's going on?
You're just in time for the moon shot.
Oh, that.
I went through that whole astronaut booklet from cover to cover.
I could have gone up in that rocket.
I even volunteered to.
But it's not what you know, it's who you know.
I think they're getting ready for the countdown.
- Five.
Four.
Three.
- Five.
Four.
Three.
- Two.
One - Two.
One.
Blast off.
That's the Addams determination.
If I know Fester, he'll catch up.

They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family There's nothing more romantic than a dark, chill attic in a thunderstorm.
We spent some of our happiest moments up here, on nights like this.
Darling, will you ever forget our honeymoon?
That wonderful sandstorm in Death Valley.
You sang my favorite song to me, Sand Gets in Your Eyes.
Tish, we haven't been alone up here since the flashflood on Valentine's Day.
Gomez.
Yes, querida?
You're dripping.
Zounds!
For want of a shingle, a lovely moment is lost.
Just move over.
No, darling, please.
I don't want all that water sloshing around up here.
No problem.
There.
If that little Dutch boy had had a cigar, he wouldn't have gotten his thumb wet.
Darling, isn't that Great-Grandfather Peg leg's old sea chest?
By george, so it is.
Peg leg, the last of the adventurous Addams.
He was adventurous, all right.
Wanted by 15 countries for piracy.
Well, let's see what we have here.
Darling, what's this?
A sextant.
My, wasn't he the naughty one.
Old Peg leg's peg leg.
Oh, the poor thing.
How did he lose his leg, dear?
He didn't.
Just wore this for appearances.
Stylish.
Look, darling, a map.
Maybe it shows in what waters they buried the old boy.
Oh, was grandfather Peg leg buried at sea?
Full military honors.
Handcuffed.
Blindfolded.
Dropped off a plank.
Poor dear.
He probably never had a chance to pick up his treasure.
Or his insurance.
Did you say "treasure"?
That's what the map says.
The exact locations and whereabouts of Peg leg Addams' sunken treasure.
See?
Looks like the Sargasso Strait.
Darling, why don't we just toddle over and pick it up?
- A treasure hunt?
- Why not?
We lead such routine lives.
Magnificent idea.
Out on the seven seas.
Wind in the rigging.
Salt spray in our faces.
And us lashed to the mast.
Oh, how thrilling.
Darling, what about your sinuses?
Did old Peg leg worry about his sinuses?
When he was the scourge of the seven seas?
- When he walked the plank.
- Oh, yes.
I forgot.
This is going to be so exciting.
Darling, what flag shall we sail under?
The flag we Addamses have always sailed under.
The Jolly Roger.
Sunken treasure.
I knew Fester would spark to the adventure of it.
Oh, I love adventures, just so there's money involved.
Uncle Fester, we're not going for the money.
The gold?
Aren't you buccaneers forgetting something?
- The jewels.
- No, the children.
They're in school.
Well, we'll just take them out of school.
Yes.
The principal's always suggesting it, anyway.
But it'll only be temporary, of course.
- Mommy.
- Speak of the little devils, here they are.
Wednesday, Pugsley darling, how was school?
- Terrible.
- A real drag.
Especially History.
Nothing ever happens in History, except names and dates.
Yeah, they never tell us anything interesting.
Like, how many heads they chopped off in the French Revolution.
That's the trouble with the schools.
They just don't make these executions come alive.
But, darlings, we're going to change all that.
We're going to make history interesting by living it.
You mean, we're going to chop off someone's No, no, no, darling.
I mean, we're going to take a wonderful trip, and look for treasure.
Just where is this supposed treasure?
Right here.
But, first, we better get rid of this.
Now, we start at point X, go 22 degrees north by northeast.
Follow the equator, past the Tropic of Cancer, and turn left.
Then, where are we?
- Lost.
- Nonsense, dear.
You just follow this red line from here to Darling, there's something missing here.
You're right.
What's missing is the half of the map that shows where the treasure is.
Yuck.
Watch your language, Wednesday.
Darling, that was the only thing that was in the trunk.
The rest of it must be around the house somewhere.
Right!
We'll divide ourselves into search parties.
Oh, that bell's out of order again.
Have to use the spare.
You rang?
Lurch, we have a small problem.
We must find the lost half of this treasure map.
Now, we're gonna have to search high and low.
So, Lurch, you search high, and, children, you search low.
But what about me?
Uncle Fester, darling, why don't you take the playroom, the caves, and the wine cellars?
Mama, you take the art gallery, the discotheque, and the kitchen.
Thing, search between every wall.
Now, everybody spread out.
Darling, aren't you going to help us look?
Querida, a captain just gives orders.
Aye, aye, sir.
You'll make a lovely first mate.
First mate?
Are you planning on others?
Cara mia, not the kind you're thinking about.
Four bells.
Think I'll go aft and shiver my timbers.
Darling, you sound so nautical.
I can just see you now.
On the bridge, at the helm, guiding us through storm-tossed seas.
Through squalls and gales.
And I will.
If I don't forget my seasick pills.
I think I better go see if I have any.
- Hey, Morticia, look what I found.
- The map?
Oh no, something better than that.
A case of rum.
You know, you can't go to sea without a yo ho ho and a bottle of rum.
But, Uncle Fester, do you think it's still drinkable?
Well, there's only one way to find out.
Well, at least it was a great year for corks.
Morticia, Fester, don't give up the ship, mates, here's the missing map.
Oh, darling, they match perfectly!
- Eureka!
The treasure hunt is on.
- Oh, goody!
Now, we have one small problem.
How're we going to get there?
Nothing to it.
Start at point X. Go 22 degrees north by northeast, follow the equator, past the Tropic of Cancer, and turn left.
No, darling.
- Turn right?
- No, Morticia means, we haven't got a ship.
All we need is a cozy little vessel with a tight-lipped crew.
To ensure top secret, we'll be our own crew.
Darling, with you in command, how can we go wrong?
- Well, I'll tell you - We'll have no mutinous talk, sir!
Unless you like to be flogged, keel-hauled, and thrown into iron.
You know something?
I think I'd like that.
It's the sea in his blood.
Well now, where do we find a boat?
Where we find everything, of course, in the classified.
Let's see, boomerangs, bottle tops, boats.
Thank you, Thing.
Here's one.
Captain Grimby's Charter Boat Service.
"No job too ridiculous".
- Sounds like our man.
- I'll call him.
Oh, goody!
That Fester, knows all the latest dances.
Captain, are you sure you want to rent them that leaky tub of ours?
If their money ain't leaky.
Well, I got dibs on the lifeboat.
You and me, both.
Come in, gentlemen.
Welcome aboard.
Been expecting you.
Well, I'm Captain Grimby.
This is my first mate, Mr. Brack.
How do you do, Grimby?
Brack.
Been doing some deep-sea diving in the bath tub.
Wonderful practice.
- Gentlemen.
- This is my lovely wife, Morticia.
You men of the sea have a certain air about you.
We just got off a tuna charter.
As you can see, we're getting a few things ready for the voyage.
Is that a bed of nails?
Oh, yes.
A few homey touches will make the ship much more comfy.
I'm afraid you've come at feeding time.
Excuse me.
There, Esmeralda.
She must have her daily ration of iron.
Of course, we'll take our own piranha.
They keep the ship's galley so nice and neat.
Now, men.
Let me brief you.
Maybe the briefer, the better.
Your duties will be basically light.
Pull the hawsers, prepare the mess.
- Prepare the mess?
- You can clean it up, too.
When the piranha get tired.
Make sure there's plenty of port on the portside.
Now, wait a minute.
Who's going to run this ship?
Don't pry, Grimby.
Due to the secrecy of the mission, key positions will be handled by the family.
What's that?
That's our Cousin Itt.
He's our lookout.
He's your lookout?
Don't be fooled by the glasses, Brack.
He's got the eye of an eagle.
Plus, a few of his own.
Well, here I am.
All ready to help dive for the treasure.
What treasure?
Great-Grandfather Peg leg's treasure.
He dropped it overboard during the mutiny.
Mutiny?
Who was mutinying?
Great-Grandfather Peg leg.
We have the exact location of the treasure, right here.
- Let me see that.
- Not so fast, Grimby.
First I must have your solemn vow of secrecy.
- I vow, I vow.
- Good enough.
Where did you get this thing?
In a box of corn flakes?
In a box of corn flakes?
What do we look like?
A pack of nuts?
Give this man a cigar.
Come on, Captain, let's go.
Very well, Captain, if you're not interested in $10 million of Spanish gold, we'll find someone else.
Did you say $10 million?
Could be $20 million, but what does it matter, as long as we have fun?
Excuse me.
Sargasso Strait, eh?
Yeah, there were a lot of treasure ships sunk there.
Old Peg leg sank most of them.
But even if the treasure's there, do you realize what an expedition like this would cost?
Not exactly, Captain.
50,000?
You think it's real money?
It ain't cigar coupons.
Friend, you've found your man.
We'll be back tomorrow with a list of stores.
I guess I misjudged you fellows.
Well, of course.
Why should we think you're a pack of nuts?
Yeah, that was silly of me.
Captain, are you actually gonna take those goofs on this trip?
We're gonna take them, but not on any trip.
Uncle Fester, dear, what are you doing?
Getting some more equipment ready, like this extra-special life preserver.
Oh?
And this anchor that'll hold a boat real steady.
Must've gotten the materials mixed.
Well, everything else checks out, and in case we run out of food, I got my harpoon.
I'll harpoon a whale.
Thar she blows!
Uncle Fester, you've wrecked the plumbing.
So what?
Whales don't have any plumbing, and, if we get attacked by pirates, I'll give them what for with old reliable.
Right on target.
I'll put this map in the safe before we have anymore mishaps.
Oh, Gomez, let me crack the safe.
Uncle Fester, we have the combination.
I know, but it's so much more fun blowing it.
Sorry, old man, but we're fresh out of dynamite.
It's all set.
Now, watch this.
By george, it was booby trapped.
Real fun, and a great burglar alarm, too.
Dear Uncle Fester, someday your name will be linked with Edison, Marconi, and Einstein.
Thank you, Morticia.
That is a great law firm.
- This is gonna be a snap.
- Yeah.
Hey, it's the chubby coop, what do we do?
Ignore him.
Let's just look around.
Who's there?
It's you.
For a minute there, I thought it was burglars.
Burglars?
Us?
Yeah, but you fellows aren't supposed to be here till tomorrow.
We just came to take another look at the treasure map.
- Where is it?
- In the safe.
Where's the safe?
Right in back of Uncle Droop.
Thanks.
The next one better not be Uncle Droop.
That's Aunt Drip.
Come on.
All right, open up.
No one's allowed to open this safe but Morticia and Gomez.
Looks like a little persuasion is in order.
How does that feel?
Best migraine treatment I ever had.
Okay, wise guy.
Give it another turn.
Beginning to get to you, huh?
Oh, boy, that's really good.
Does this feel good, too?
No, that gives me a headache.
Come on, talk.
Combination to the safe, let's have it.
Okay, let's see, 35-right.
Or is that 35-left?
Say, fellows, there's something about this safe I feel you ought to know.
Just give the numbers, chubby.
- All right, let's see.
Right-81.
- Right-81.
- Left to 64.
- Left-64.
- Make that 63.
- 63.
- Left to 29.
- Left-29.
- Back to 13.
- Back to 13.
- Back to 16.
- Back to 16.
- Left to 22.
- Left to 22.
Now, pull the handle.
Okay.
That burglar alarm needs fixing.
Either that, or it was 35-right.
I don't know about you, Captain, but I'm getting out.
Sorry, fellows.
Fester, what's going on here?
Boy, you sure picked a couple of lulus.
That Grimby and Brack tried to swipe the treasure map.
- Oh, dear.
- Morticia, would you get me out of here?
Yes.
That was very unsporting of them.
Just for that, we won't charter their ship.
You mean you're going to call off the trip?
Of course not, we'll buy our own boat.
- Of course!
We still have the treasure map.
- Oh, good.
Oh, darling, what about the other Addams' valuables?
Well, let's see.
Cousin Itt's baby comb.
My bugle!
I'm glad this didn't get damaged.
Sorry, old man, just wanted to see if you're on your toes.
Darling, what's this?
"Peg leg Addams' secret code book".
"Without which the Peg leg Addams treasure map is absolutely worthless".
Darling, shall we pinpoint the treasure then?
Right.
I'll give you the map markings and you give me the locations.
Very well.
Double-Y Z. Double-Y Z is Jamaica.
Now, follow the red line to Triple-Y M. Triple-Y M. Zanzibar.
Right.
Now, we're closing in.
Now, the yellow line to quadruple-T.
Quadruple-T is Novaya Zemlya.
Your Russian is flawless.
Now, the purple line to quintuple-O.
Quintuple-O is the Fiji Islands.
Perfect!
Now, from here we simply bisect the transit, adjust for drift, and here is where the treasure lies.
The Antipodes?
No, right under our house.
Under our house?
How lucky for us that those men tried to rob us.
Otherwise, we'd be off on a wild goose chase.
Darlings, let's drink to our good fortune.
Capital idea.
Thank you, Thing.
Dear Thing, he's always there when you want him.
Just a moment, I better taste it first.
Nothing like a safe to give a wine just the right mellowness.
Keep digging, darlings, I'm sure that treasure's down there somewhere.
I think I hit something.
That's my foot!
What's it doing under our house?
It's not under the house, it's under your shovel.
Sorry, sorry.
A treasure chest!
A great moment is at hand.
Okay, heave.
There it is.
Hodgebotkins.
We'll have to shoot off the lock.
Stand back, everyone.
My other foot!
I told you to stand back.
All right.
By george, it's gold!
It's a king's ransom.
Is it real?
There's a very simple test.
Well, old Peg leg never was too bright about these things.
You mean, we've wasted our time?
Not at all.
It's delicious.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family No!
No.
How's the market, dear?
Closed.
I just do this to keep in practice.
Very sensible.
If there's another crash, you'll be ready for it.
Well, I was ready for that one.
Pugsley's new chemistry set.
He's making a different kind of TNT.
Those educational toys certainly keep a boy out of mischief.
Wish I could say the same for Uncle Fester.
I caught him cheating at checkers.
Inexcusable!
Unless he was playing for money.
Well, time for my Zen-Yogi.
I really had to discipline him.
He's forbidden to leave the house all day.
Thank heavens.
There for a moment I thought he was going to leave.
The mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
- Bill?
- It's from my sister, Ophelia.
Why would she send us a bill?
Darling, it's not a bill.
The poor dear's in trouble, and she needs our help desperately.
What's the problem?
She was too upset to say.
Who could that be?
It may not be a who.
It may be a what.
- Dreamer.
- Telegram.
Thank you very much, Lurch.
Oh, it's from Ophelia.
Didn't wait very long for an answer.
What's it say?
"Help".
Sounds like an excited caller.
Either that or the doorbell's stuck.
Miss Ophelia.
Ophelia!
We haven't heard from you in nearly two minutes.
Dear Ophelia!
Unburden yourself, darling.
Tell us everything.
Aren't you gonna tell us about your trouble?
Trouble?
What trouble?
Oh, that trouble.
My life is ruined.
- Sounds kind of serious.
- A man?
Brilliant, charming, cultured.
- Rich!
- Alive?
Yes, I'm almost sure he was alive.
My mother objects.
Granny Frump?
Egad, she must be sick.
Why?
She says if he's in love with me, there must be something wrong with him.
That's a point.
Nonsense.
You're a lovely, intelligent girl, and we're going to help you.
She certainly needs help.
The first thing we should do is meet your intended.
When can we see him?
This is my beloved.
Horatio Bartholomew, at your service.
How positively continental.
Have you spent much time in Europe, Mr. Bartholomew?
All my life.
Oxford, Cambridge, University of Heidelberg.
Oh, my Apollo.
My Ariel!
My knight in shining armor.
You'll have to forgive Ophelia.
She's a bit shy with men.
I've searched the world over.
I've never met anyone like her.
I'll buy that.
We want to fly away together.
Roam the seven seas.
Search the far corners of the Earth.
But first, we'll have a spot of lunch.
Thank you, Lurch.
Magnificent lunch.
I should be honored to have your recipe for the cherries jubilee.
Cherries jubilee?
Oh, that was flambeau of jellyfish.
Flambeau of jellyfish?
How did you two get together?
Mama, please!
They're not on the witness stand.
How did you two get together?
It was at this wonderful Ionely hearts club luau.
I looked over the suckling pig, and there she was.
Well, if you have so much money, what were you doing at a Ionely hearts club?
Mama, please!
What were you doing at a Ionely hearts club?
I was looking for a simple girl.
You sure struck oil.
Well, it's time for a walk in the garden.
Allow me.
I just love when she does that.
Come, Horatio.
My love.
Well, querida, what do you think?
- He's charming.
- Rich.
- Attractive.
- Magnetic.
- Impossible.
- Exactly.
Too perfect.
The man's an obvious phony.
An imposter.
How shall we prove it?
Simple matter.
He claims he's rich.
I'll call Brad and Dunstreet, the financial authorities.
Excellent thinking, darling.
One of them is bound to be in.
Hello, Brad and Dunstreet?
Gomez Addams here.
Try to keep a civil tongue in your head.
Just making an enquiry.
What do you have on Horatio Bartholomew?
Yes, I'll wait.
They're running him through their computer.
The marvels of science.
They're running him through their computer, and he's walking in our garden.
All at the same time.
Amazing.
What?
Yes.
Are you sure?
Thank you.
Just as I thought.
They never heard of Horatio Bartholomew.
Oh, my darling sister.
In the hands of a scheming adventurer.
A Ionely hearts club bluebeard!
Poor Ophelia.
If your Cousin Itt hadn't been such a playboy, they might be married by now.
Perhaps we can have another talk with the little roué.
Roué.
That's French.
I wish you'd said that.
Darling, please.
Let's concentrate on Cousin Itt.
What?
- Cousin Itt.
- Oh, yes, yes!
Oh, Cousin Itt.
At least we know he's up there.
Let me try, dear.
Careful of the soot.
Okay, dear.
Cousin Itt!
Would you come down, please?
We'd like to have a little chat with you.
Itt, you come down here this minute!
Well, now we know another thing.
The chimney needs cleaning.
Cousin Itt!
If you don't come down I'm going to be very hurt.
I scared you down, didn't I?
Cousin Itt, you know how fond we are of you.
Thank you.
You do put things so nicely.
Itt, we think you are perfect husband material.
Suave, sophisticated, cultured.
Yes, and loaded, too.
Now, with women throwing themselves at you all the time, of course you've probably become a bit jaded.
That's true.
If a person is going to become jaded, that is the best way.
But we think it's time that you settle down, got married.
Itt, are you still with us?
Good.
We have the perfect mate for you.
My darling sister, Ophelia.
Bachelors.
Always playing hard to get.
I didn't realize your sister was such a swinger.
Faster!
Faster!
Faster!
Ophelia, where are you?
Horatio.
What have you done with the swing?
I've got it right here, dear.
My goodness!
Don't worry, dear.
I'll catch you.
That was fun.
I just love it when you do things like that.
I must save my poor deluded sister from the clutches of that beast.
Right.
She's deluded enough without him.
But I love Horatio.
The man's a bounder and a cad.
And not a very nice one.
He's the only one that loves me.
I know he loves me.
The daisies told me so.
Ophelia.
Are you going to listen to the daisies or to Mama?
What do you see?
I see a man with a Heidelberg scar and a bushy mustache.
That's the blackguard.
Mama, tell Ophelia the truth about this man.
He's loaded, elegant and unattached.
And if you ask me, he'd make Ophelia a perfect husband.
Mama, either you're out of practice or that ball needs repairing.
That scoundrel must have tampered with it.
Very well then.
Get your own crystal ball.
The cleverness of the fiend.
Even fooling Mama.
Oh, shame, shame.
To pillory that poor man with your outrageous slings and arrows.
Oh, Horatio, my love.
I'm coming.
You're going the wrong way, dear.
He's upstairs in Uncle Fester's room.
Flying to her destruction like a moth to a flame.
- What do we do?
- Blow out the flame.
This is fun.
Ophelia.
Locking yourself up this way isn't going to solve the problem.
I'm going to stay in here until I perish.
But, darling, what good would you be to Horatio dead?
Interesting point.
Ophelia, the man is not only a scoundrel, he doesn't even have a job.
But, darling, you don't have a job, either.
Exactly, one playboy in the family is enough.
Besides, he's a liar, claims to have been at Heidelberg.
Should be easy enough to disprove that.
Well, of course.
We'll simply call the Heidelberg Dean of Men.
Not necessary!
All Heidelbergers are expert swordsmen.
I'll just get down the sabers and test this blowhard.
Hope you don't mind a friendly exchange of steel, Bartholomew.
Not at all.
You'll forgive me if I'm a bit rusty.
Rusty, eh?
You beginning to get the drift, Ophelia?
All right, choose your weapons.
Now, the moment Lurch drops his handkerchief, we begin.
Just a minute, old boy.
Let's wait till the handkerchief hits the floor.
Sorry.
Whenever you're ready.
Bravo, Gomez.
Wonderful evasive action.
Now all I have to do is evade the furniture.
Allow me.
None of your trickery here, old man.
Sorry, Bruno.
Would you like to wrestle?
You were magnificent, dear.
Where did the coward go?
Upstairs, to wash the blood off his hands.
- Blood on his hands, eh?
- Your blood.
Now will you help Horatio and me plot our troth?
Really, Ophelia.
Would you marry a penniless imposter?
Penniless.
Horatio?
You'll soon laugh on the other side of your daisies.
Are we going to call Brad and Dunstreet again?
There are other ways to unmask a braggart.
Braggart, come down here and bring some money.
Darling, don't you think you'd better let Mr. Bartholomew cut the cards?
Too risky.
Excuse me, it's time to feed Cleopatra.
On with the game, Bartholomew.
Horatio, pick a daisy for luck.
That one must have taken root.
Try another.
My love.
Well, what about $200, just for openers?
I should go out.
Nothing like hard cash on the line to weed out the ribbon clerks.
However, just for sociability, I'll see your $200 and raise you $200.
Just as I thought.
Phony.
That bill is yours.
Strange.
Uncle Fester's picture is on there.
I told him to keep his Monopoly money out of this drawer.
All right!
Here's that $200, your $200, and $500 more.
Raise him back, Horatio.
Raise him back.
If it will amuse you, dear.
Your $500, and I'll raise you $500.
That is if you'll accept a check.
I knew we'd get to the check ploy.
We're playing for cash, Bartholomew, not paper.
Very well, then.
I'll raise you $100.
All right, ribbon clerk.
What do you have?
A pair of deuces.
Deuces?
That's good.
I thought you were bluffing.
Still, he isn't exactly penniless.
So he carried a few extra kopecks around in his pocket.
Tactic number one in the fortune-seekers' manual.
Darling, you know so much about the world.
I've lived in it all my life.
Still, it grieves me to see that sweet, charming creature in the clutches of that abominable monster.
Gomez!
Dear Horatio decided he didn't want the money he won from you.
Maybe we misjudged the monster.
He gave it all away.
Blackguard.
Probably leave you for the first pretty ankle that comes along.
Fiddle-dee-dee.
Prove it.
Gomez can't, but I can.
Morticia!
Don't worry, darling.
I'll lead him to the brink and stop him at the gate.
It'll do you no good.
I'm the blonde.
And I'm more fun.
Yes, I am.
Did you want to see me about something?
Not something.
Us.
Gomez and Ophelia have gone out.
We're all alone.
Just the two of us, together.
Care to play checkers?
Oh, what a tight leash you have on your passions, dear.
Come, sit beside me.
If he lays a hand on her, I'll kill him.
And give him a piece of my mind, too.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable here?
I'm quite all right here.
That's better.
When you first entered this house, you must have felt the vibrations.
True, I have.
But it's an old house.
It's bound to have a few vibrations.
Horatio, why do you resist me?
Because I'm in love with your sister.
Excuses, excuses.
Take me.
Take you where?
I knew you couldn't resist me.
Mrs. Addams, you're beautiful, charming, cultured, talented, intelligent, witty, rich and completely feminine.
You're just not my type.
Not your type?
How dare you insult my wife.
So you've been watching!
This entire day has been nothing but a silly test.
I love you for what you are.
Whatever that is.
And I love you for what you are.
Whatever that is.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello.
Morticia Addams speaking.
Oh, yes.
Just a moment.
Gomez, dear.
It's Brad and Dunstreet calling back about Mr. Bartholomew.
Hello, Mr. Dunstreet.
Sorry.
Hello, Mr. Brad.
Really?
Yes, I see.
Yes, that is interesting.
Thank you.
Nailed him as a draft dodger, too, eh?
Seems there's been a slight mistake.
They were checking out a Mr. Henry Bartholomew.
Who's he?
A fraud, a forger, and a draft dodger.
Henry Bartholomew is definitely out.
What about Horatio?
Well, he's not the richest man in the world.
He's the second richest man in the world.
We'll apologize to him forthwith.
Mr. Bartholomew, I'm afraid we owe you an apology.
Yes, indeed, Bartholomew, old man.
We've misjudged you.
Oh, well!
You're not only acceptable to this family, I'm going to see to it that you're a full-fledged member of the Zen-Yogi society.
- Zen-Yogi?
- The only true way to inner peace.
- Ridiculous.
- Ridiculous?
Some of the men in our family, the Frump family, have found inner peace swinging from a chandelier.
- Absurd.
- Absurd?
Perhaps you'd prefer a simple romp in the swamp.
- Nonsense.
- Nonsense?
But, Horatio, a man who doesn't like to stand on his head or swing from a chandelier or have a simple romp in the swamp is maladjusted.
Lucky me.
Lucky me, for finding out in time.
Ophelia, he's the second richest man in the world.
My mother taught me never to settle for second best.
A true Frump.
It will take a long time for my wounds to heal.
But I'll get over it.
You mean it?
You really want to marry Ophelia?
You dear, sweet, lovable creature.
That Ophelia.
A one-man woman.
Darling, are you sure you know how to saw a woman in half?
Positive.
It's putting her together again I'm not sure of.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh, it's from Ophelia.
Oh, she says she and Itt had a lovers' quarrel, and the engagement is off.
But she's found a new love.
I like a girl who can bounce back.
What's he like?
Well, she says he's not only rich, charming and handsome, but he also claims to be Napoleon.
Napoleon?
Sounds like the perfect match.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Didn't know Pugsley was home from school so early.
He's certainly getting a lot out of that little atomic reactor you bought him.
Mother, Father.
Thank you, darling.
My son, who's minding the reactor upstairs?
I gave that to Wednesday.
All that kid stuff is behind me now.
What I really want is Don't stop.
After all, we feel towards you as if you were our own son.
Gomez, he is!
I thought he looked familiar.
All right now, out with it, boy.
I need some money.
Oh, is that all?
Well, I think the boy is entitled to an allowance, dear.
How about 100 a week?
$100 a week for a boy of ten?
You're right, we'll make it 200.
But, Mother, you don't understand.
I want to work.
Work!
Watch your language, boy.
We Addamses haven't worked in 300 years.
Supervise or manage, yes, but work, never.
Pugsley!
You'd be the laughingstock of the entire family.
But, Mother, I'm not joking.
- I want to go to - Stop!
We've heard quite enough, young man.
March right upstairs to your room.
- But, Mother - No buts.
Oh, where, Gomez?
Where have we failed that boy?
I know he said work, but maybe it was just a slip of the tongue.
No, he meant it.
Well, the boy's been into that library, sneaking out those Horatio Alger books.
- Not only that, he's been reading.
- Well, now.
Well, I wasn't allowed to even touch Horatio Alger until I was 28.
A brainwashing like that could ruin a child's character.
Well, are you two ready?
- Ready!
- Ready!
Right, go!
Sure tickles.
Obviously, Pugsley took a wrong turn.
I certainly don't understand it.
Boy's had a proper upbringing.
We gave him all the dynamite he could ever want.
That blade is cold.
He certainly had good pets.
Aristotle, loving octopus.
And a cheerful little spider like Homer.
Fester!
How do you do it?
Very simple.
You two have just got bad aim.
Well, what are we gonna do about Pugsley?
Darling, I was thinking.
Why don't we let him earn some money?
Might teach him a lesson.
Let's not get carried away.
What is he going to do with the money?
He wants to buy a jet-powered motor scooter with interchangeable hubcaps.
Oh, well.
Certainly nothing wrong with that.
Is there?
- You rang?
- Gadzooks, Lurch.
Here before I ring.
That's what I call efficiency.
Have you seen Pugsley?
On the roof.
- What's he doing up there?
- Testing his parachute.
So that's where my silk chemise went.
Chemise Tish French.
Pugsley.
We've come to a decision.
We've decided, no matter how bizarre it may seem, we're going to let you go to work.
Whoopee!
Now, Pugsley.
You've been taught to watch your language.
Naturally, you'll need a job in keeping with your heritage and social status.
I have it, a shipping magnate.
You like shipping, dear?
Last time I was on a ship, I got sick.
Better idea, astronaut.
I don't think so, dear.
If he got sick on a boat, imagine what would happen up in that capsule.
If you don't mind, I'd like to find my own job.
Reminds me of Cousin Goop.
There was a fellow who really knew how to look for a job.
Never found one.
You know, darling, the last time I tied you up like this, it took you three weeks to escape.
Great sport.
Dr. Bird.
Oh, I didn't know anyone was sick in this house.
- I'm not sick.
Are you sick, Gomez?
- Never felt better.
I'm afraid you have the wrong house.
I'm sure I have the right house.
This boy must belong to you.
Of course he does.
- Is he sick?
- No.
I'm sick!
- Why don't you see a doctor?
- I am a doctor!
But he's not!
Well, of course not.
Pugsley won't even be ready for medical school for a year or two.
At least!
But in the meantime, I'll thank you to keep that meddling little menace out of my operating room!
But I was only looking for a job.
Surely you don't object to the lad seeking honest employment?
Oh, no.
Not at all.
What I object to is him coming right in, in the middle of an appendectomy, wielding a scalpel!
I'm sure he was only trying to help.
Don't you have an apprentice program, like the plumbers and carpenters?
Mr. Addams, I'm sure you don't realize that operations require the utmost delicacy and finesse.
Yes.
Perhaps surgery is a bit too advanced for Pugsley.
But I'm sure he could give a marvelous anesthesia.
If your boy wants to get into my hospital, any part of my hospital, he'll have to require medical help, not give it!
Well, so much for medicine.
Don't you worry, darling.
- Those menial jobs aren't for you.
- Of course not.
Pugsley, if you're bound to work, I'll let you manage my mango plantation.
Now, it's in Brazil.
We'd miss you.
No, I said I was going to find my own job, and I'm going to.
The lad has determination.
All right, querida.
Count up to ten.
You ready?
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Oh, I forgot to tell Pugsley, I heard of a vacancy in Harvard Five.
Six.
Seven.
- In the bank vault?
- That's where we found him.
Right between the 50s and the 100s.
I was only counting them.
That's very good, Pugsley, darling, you weren't wasting your time on 5s and 10s.
Mrs. Addams.
It is not the policy of the First National Bank to start our trainees off in the vault.
And what bothers me is how he got in there in the first place.
Oh, I think I can explain that.
- He dug a tunnel.
- A tunnel?
Yes, he's always digging tunnels.
Aren't you, Pugsley, darling?
I had to.
You kept throwing me out of your office.
Is that true, Mr. Glenville?
Mr. Addams will hear about this.
Gomez!
Right here, Morticia.
Heard the whole thing.
Your apology is in order, Glenville.
My apology?
Your son's been pestering me for a job.
That's hardly cause for violence.
- The job he wanted was vice president.
- What's wrong with that?
- I'm vice president!
- Oh.
Well, we wouldn't want you to lose your job.
How about making Pugsley president?
You people must be out of your minds.
You rang?
On second thought, maybe it's my mind.
Lurch, Mr. Glenville has been behaving rather badly.
Follow me.
Well, there goes banking.
Banking really isn't very dependable.
Have you noticed how they keep switching those interest rates?
Well, Pugsley, you're still welcome to go into business with me.
We'd call it Addams and Son.
- What would we do?
- Do?
Isn't it enough that we'd be together?
I'd teach you how to be an escape artist.
I think I better go out and look some more.
Chip off the old block.
- Well, back to the counting.
- Yes, darling.
Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-two.
Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-three.
Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-four.
Eighty-one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-five Master Pugsley and Bennie, the bookie.
Forgive me, Mr. Bennie, I'm a little tied up at the moment.
My lovely wife, Morticia.
- Figures.
- A bookie Mr. Bennie, are you in the publishing business?
Are you putting me on, lady?
The only thing I publish is a tip sheet.
And I don't want any punk like this moving in on me.
All I was doing was answering the phone for him.
By the time I caught him, I lost a bundle at Hialeah.
Pugsley!
You don't mean to say you were looking for a position in a racing parlor?
I thought it was a funeral parlor.
That's what it said in the window.
Well, that's just to fool the local fuzz.
If they ever find out what I'm doing, it'll be my funeral.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to use your phone.
Let the boys know I'm on my way back.
By all means, Mr. Bennie.
Pugsley, darling, I'm glad you didn't take a position with that man.
- He's much too high-strung.
- Must be the tax situation.
- Paying them?
- Avoiding them.
Pugsley, why don't you give up job hunting and take an allowance?
I wanna work for my money.
That boy's fallen in with the wrong crowd.
Nonsense, darling.
The only child he's been playing with is our own daughter, Wednesday.
Tish, I spoke French.
Nothing like a joust with the foils after a big lunch.
I hardly ate a bite.
Pugsley's been gone all afternoon and I'm so worried.
So am I. He may have found a job.
He wants us to look out the window.
Thank you, Thing.
By george!
There's Pugsley and Wednesday, talking to the Hensons.
Querida.
Oh, wouldn't you know it.
They're doing their usual captivating job.
The little rascals, who can resist them?
- A job?
- I'll do anything.
And I'll be his assistant.
She's paying me a quarter to do that.
Oh, I see.
Well, what would you charge me to trim the hedge, wash my car, and clean out the attic?
- A quarter?
- A half a dollar.
Oh, all right.
- A half a dollar.
- It's a deal.
Good.
Now, Mrs. Henson and I will be away for the rest of the day.
We'll see you when we get back.
But, remember, I want to get rid of everything in that attic.
- Everything?
- Everything, down to the last cobweb.
- And my car.
- Yes, sir.
- I want it cleaned, inside and out.
- Yes, sir.
And don't forget to trim the hedge.
Trim, trim, trim.
- We will, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
Arthur.
Don't you think you could have given them Nonsense, my dear.
Those kids get gypped a few times, it sharpens them up.
Why, people like me are benefactors to those children.
Yes, I'm a little nervous about those Addams kids.
Oh, what's the difference?
Why, he looks strong as an ox and she probably is very wiry.
Oh, well, you'd hire Jack the Ripper and Lizzie Borden if they worked cheap enough.
I know what I'm doing.
If I really get that attic cleaned out and this hedge trimmed, I can unload this lemon.
Come on, Charity, we gotta go.
We gotta foreclose on that Smith place before 3:00.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello.
- Oh, darling, it's you.
- Who you calling "darling"?
Your son, Pugsley.
Yes, darling.
Really?
Oh, that's wonderful!
Yes, goodbye, dear.
Pugsley has a position with Mr. Henson.
And Wednesday is assisting.
Henson's a big man in property management.
I suppose they'll have to start at the bottom.
No, at the top.
They're cleaning out Mr. Henson's attic.
Little scamps don't waste much time getting going.
With their deft way with blasting caps, they'll have that attic cleaned out before you can say, "Take cover".
My dear, it took me years to acquire the proficiency of the Australian Aborigine with the boomerang.
So don't be too disappointed at the showing you first make.
All right, now try it, my dear.
- Yes, that's it.
- Like this, dear?
Yes, indeed.
Not bad for a beginner!
Now, the essential quality of the boomerang is that - It returns to its thrower.
- Correct.
As a matter of fact, a real expert can make it return Again and again.
Wonderful!
Seven more years of lovely luck.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Hi!
- My little working force.
Home from the first day on the job.
What did the Hensons think of your work?
They didn't get back yet.
But it's all done.
Wonderful!
Trust an Addams to finish the job.
Finish the job?
They're the first Addamses who've ever had one!
I'll get that.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello?
Yes, Mr. Henson.
How delightful to hear from you again.
Well, of course we can come right over.
We'll be there in a few moments.
Probably want to show us the children's great work.
He seemed very excited about something.
Excited?
Of course, I'm excited!
Look what those kids of yours did to my hedge!
Oh!
Oh, well, I don't blame you for being excited about that.
That's sheer artistry.
All I said was trim it.
Trim, trim, trim.
Mr. Henson.
Anyone can trim a hedge.
It takes imagination to shape it.
All that wonderful talent in those pudgy little hands.
Well, let me show you something else those pudgy little hands did!
I told them to clean the car, inside and out.
Sounds fair enough.
This way?
By george, I wish I'd thought of that.
Lurch just shakes our car out.
It's soaked!
You lucky man.
Stock it with trout, you won't even have to leave the garage to go fishing.
Dear Pugsley.
He's so original.
I can't wait to see how they handled the attic.
Oh, they did a real bang-up job on the attic.
Look there!
All I asked them to do was to clean out the attic and get rid of everything.
Well, they certainly cleaned it out.
There isn't a trace of anything.
I'm gonna have to rebuild that whole east wing.
And I assure you, sir, I'm gonna sue you for every dime's worth of damage that fat little demon of yours caused.
Gomez.
Is he talking about Pugsley?
I guess so.
Although I never thought of him as a demon.
Mr. Henson!
I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to apologize.
Apologize?
I'm calling my lawyers immediately.
In that case, Henson, I am going to have to countersue.
You!
Sue me for what?
Henson, you're running an illegal sweatshop.
Sweatshop!
There are still child-labor laws in this country, Henson.
You could be in a lot of trouble.
Come along, my dear.
I'm going home to prepare my case.
Mr. Henson.
I want you to know that Wednesday and Pugsley will never have my permission to work for you again.
We, therefore, hold that the deponent is guilty as charged of violating due process and illegally using little children.
Getting all that, Thing?
Now, we could use a nice, resounding legal phrase right here.
Habeas corpus?
- Nolo contendere?
- Tish.
- That's French!
- It's Latin.
Oh.
Type that up right away, will you, Thing?
Lurch!
What's the meaning of this?
- Found him.
- Found him?
Lurking on the porch.
- I - Put Mr. Henson in the good chair, Lurch.
I was not lurking!
I was just trying to get up enough nerve to ring the bell.
I'm not surprised, after the way you've behaved.
Is there something you wanted to tell us, Mr. Henson?
Like pleading guilty?
I warn you, Henson, anything you say may be held against you.
Look, my wife and I have talked this over.
We don't want to go to court.
- I'm on the verge of bankruptcy now.
- Oh.
Well, if you're a little short, perhaps we could go to small claims court?
I don't want to go to any court.
I don't want any more trouble.
All I want is a new attic, a dry car, and a little handful of hedge seed.
That doesn't seem like he's asking for too much, darling.
Let's get one thing straight, Henson.
- You do admit your guilt in this case?
- Oh, I You do admit our boy did exactly what you asked him to do?
I admit it.
I admit it.
And you're sorry?
Oh, I am sorry.
Believe me.
I'm sorry I ever saw that boy of yours.
All I wanted was to get my attic cleaned out, my hedge trimmed, so I could sell the place.
Well, the attic couldn't have been cleaned out any cleaner.
Or the hedge trimmed any prettier.
So it's a deal.
You wanna buy the place?
Mr. Addams can't resist a clean attic and a shapely hedge.
Well, I was going to ask $20,000 for the place.
- 25,000, not a penny less.
- Sold!
Sold!
All right.
5, Here's 5 to grow on.
Thank you.
Oh, you sweet, generous, lovely people.
- Hi, Mr. Henson.
- Hi, Mr. Henson.
You lovely, wonderful children.
Oh, I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Addams.
And thank you, Mr. Addams.
And thank you, sir - Little unstable, wouldn't you say?
- Yes.
Well, darlings.
I must admit your first job was a smashing success.
- See you.
- Where're you going?
We're going to put in for unemployment.
And social security.
Don't you think you're rushing things a bit?
Your mother is absolutely right.
It'll have to wait until tomorrow.
Sayonara, Tokyo Wonderful.
Terrible.
Wonderful.
Terrible.
Wonderful.
Terrible.
Darling, what's wonderful?
Consolidated Fuzz just went up 47 points.
- What's terrible?
- I don't own any.
Oh.
Who's that?
My dear, the greatest asset in business is manpower.
Now, obviously, Pugsley and Wednesday are very valuable manpower.
So I've put them to work in our own attic.
Very clever, darling.
And very economical, too.
We'll never again have to clean that Louis XIV chandelier.
Sayonara
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family It's no use.
Nothing seems to calm my nerves.
Mine either.
I couldn't believe my eyes when we drove past and saw them holding the charity bazaar without even calling on us, or even informing us.
Darling, it was probably an oversight.
Maybe they called and we weren't home.
Impossible.
Watch this.
Thing never misses a phone call.
Sorry, Thing.
False alarm.
What reason could they possibly have for not letting us know?
We've always donated more than our share.
Who else would give them a beautiful stuffed python crushing a water buffalo?
Or the chopping block of Ivan the Terrible, with the original nick still in it?
I even threw in the henchmen's ax that made those nicks.
You didn't.
Well, I got carried away.
Darling, you're generous to a fault.
That's true.
Did you see some of the junk the other people gave?
It certainly takes no imagination to donate an original Van Gogh.
Right.
Now, if someone donated his ear The trouble is it's for such a worthy cause, a new home for the aged.
I feel we should do our share.
Well, if that's all that's worrying you, forget it.
It's all taken care of.
I'm building a home for the aged of our own.
Darling, how wonderful.
There'll be a special ramp just for skateboarding.
What about tennis courts?
Tennis courts and a polo field.
Darling, you're wonderful.
You'll put that other home right out of business.
Why didn't you tell me?
I wanted to surprise you.
- Mother.
Father.
- Mother.
Father.
Darling, the children.
- What's that for?
- For later.
I don't want to lose my place.
Yes, children, it is a lovely day.
Hello, Mother.
Hello, Father.
- Hello.
- Hello, darlings.
We found a picture, but we don't know whose it is.
Sure is a slick looker.
- Well, probably me.
- It's a she.
Here she is, Mother.
Isn't she beautiful?
Sure has pretty hair.
And a nice smile.
Why, that's my mother.
Your Granny Frump.
That's Granny Frump?
When she was a teenager.
- Sure is pretty.
- A dazzler.
Sure has changed.
Well, darling, you have to remember, she's a lot older now.
I wish she was still as pretty.
She is.
Except now, it's on the inside.
On the inside?
I'll show you.
There.
Ever see anything more beautiful than that?
I have a lovely idea.
Next week is my mother's birthday, and with Grandmama Addams vacationing on Devil's Island, why don't I call on Granny Frump and have her spend a few days with us?
By all means.
And for her birthday, we could send her to Barbara Benson's Beauty Farm.
Perhaps in a week or two, they could bring some of her beauty back and put it on the outside.
It would probably be more like a year or two.
Why quibble about time?
It's only money, and besides, nothing's too good for your mother.
It'd be worth anything to see her look like that again.
Well, you can't expect miracles, darling.
I'll call Granny and ask her to come and stay with us.
But I want her birthday present to be a surprise until her birthday.
- Okay.
- Okay.
- You promise?
- Cross my heart.
- Me, too.
- That's wonderful, children.
Now, run out into the kitchen and get a snack.
Lurch has baked a lovely soufflé of aardvark.
Couldn't I just have a little bowl of sea slug?
For dessert, darling, for dessert.
Now to find my place.
Mrs. Frump.
Lurch, you sure look terrible.
- Mother!
- Morticia.
Mother.
You look terrible, too.
Well, don't just stand there, take the bags.
Oh, Mother, I told you not to.
Well, I had to buy something for the children.
You spoil them dreadfully.
Lurch, put that up in the guest room.
I'll show it to the children later.
They get such a thrill out of your gifts.
Granny Frump, I thought I heard you.
Stop slobbering.
Let me look at you.
You look worst of all.
- It's this light.
- Nothing wrong with the light.
- That's the trouble.
- I'll call the children.
No, no.
I'll go up and surprise them.
Maybe scare them a little.
All right, Agent Double-000, are you going to tell me what I want to know?
No.
Surprise.
Granny!
Say, you kids look like a couple of ghosts.
Gosh, thanks, Granny.
What're you doing?
Playing Chinese water torture.
Nice game.
Clean, too.
Granny, are you in for a big surprise.
I am?
Remember, Pugsley, you crossed your heart.
I wasn't going to tell her anything, except that Mother and Father are going to send her away.
Send me away?
Where to?
That's the secret.
I bet it's the jungle.
That hot, steaming jungle.
Great for my sinuses.
Well, gotta unpack.
Wait till you kids see what I brought you.
Really kill you.
Hi, Granny.
What're you doing?
I'm manicuring my fingernails.
Fear I have a little too much iron in my blood.
Gomez and Morticia are planning to send me away.
Happen to know where?
I didn't hear anything.
Not even a hint?
Well, let's see, yesterday they were talking about a bazaar and a home for the aged.
Oh, no.
They're not planning to send me away, they're planning to put me away.
Well, what's the difference?
Send or put?
When Morticia wanted to go to work at the age of 10, did I stop her?
No.
When she had pneumonia and wanted to run out in the snow and play, did I stop her?
No.
When she tried to run away from home, did I stop her?
No.
And what's my reward?
An old folk's home.
Well, that's it.
A perfect gift for a person who has everything.
There you are, Gomez, darling.
I wanted you to send a check to Barbara Benson's Beauty Farm.
I've arranged for my mother to stay there for two weeks.
I know it's the best birthday present we can possibly give her.
I'll make a memo so I don't forget.
What's all this other paperwork, dear?
Some notes and plans for my home for the aged.
I've added an ice skating rink and a ski jump for winter sports.
How thoughtful.
Here's the combination kitchen and garage, and there's the recreation room and discotheque.
- For men or women?
- Both.
- Together?
- Querida, you're forgetting, this is a home for the aged.
You wicked man.
Fester, I just know I'm right.
I just know they're planning to put me out to pasture.
Well, you are the outdoor type.
Look.
"Home for the aged"!
Look at this.
"Send check to cover Granny's reservation".
You see, you were afraid they were gonna put you out to pasture.
They're just going to send you to a reservation.
No, no.
They're going to send me to a home for the aged, and I don't want to go.
Hey, maybe if you show them how much pep you still got, you know, make yourself useful around the house.
Oh, Fester, I could just kiss you.
I was only trying to help.
Are you all right, deary?
If there's anything you want, let me get it for you.
- Just fine, Mother.
- That's just your imagination.
I'll fix you a little snack.
Some porcupine cookies, a bit of mongoose broth.
I just had lunch, dear.
Well, how about an ottoman for your feet?
Shall I open the window?
- But the window is open.
- Then I'll close it.
Well, of course, it's chilly in here.
I'll get you a blanket, too.
A nice itchy one.
Gomez.
Gomez, darling.
That name.
It drives me wild.
Especially when I'm shaving.
I'm sorry.
I didn't see you, Gomez.
I'll get a double blanket for you.
What's the matter with her?
I was just going to ask you that.
Glad I asked first.
She's probably still a bit upset after her trip.
Two weeks at the beauty farm should help.
Can't hurt.
There, that'll keep you both warm.
Mother, why don't you go downstairs to the playroom and stretch out on the bed of nails?
You need a little relaxation.
Me, relax?
Never.
Go, go, go.
That's me.
Give me that.
Just love to dust and do things around the house.
- Mother.
- Just call me busy fingers.
I think I'll dust my way right up to the attic, and when I finish that, I'll do the yard.
Just gotta keep go, go, going.
Go, go, go, go.
Dusting the yard?
That's ridiculous.
Of course it is.
Lurch has already dusted it.
Yes, Lurch, what is it?
Mrs. Frump, washed the clothes, polished the silverware.
I think I better have a talk with my mother.
You know, deep inside, she's really a wonderful person.
Of course she is.
You can tell by her picture.
- Mother.
- Doing dishes.
Yesiree, Bob!
That's the life.
I like drying them even better.
Well, that's that.
Fixed dinner for tonight, dinner for tomorrow's cooking, ordered groceries for a month, set the table and packed the children's lunch.
Well, I heard Lurch say the car's been acting up.
Think I'll give it a good overhauling.
Mother.
- Sorry.
Too busy.
- Mother, Mother.
Now, listen, you've got to stop trying to do so much.
Think I'm too old?
Ridiculous.
Mother, Mother.
No, darling, it isn't that.
It's just that this is Lurch's domain and he feels you're invading it.
Besides, you should relax more at your age.
At my age?
I never felt better in my life.
Until just now.
Don't worry, Granny Frump, I'll cheer you up.
How?
By reciting the poem I wrote.
"I have a gloomy little spider "I love to sit down close beside her "She never knows where she has been 'Cause all she does is spin and spin "My spider's quite a busy roamer "Which is why I called her Homer "She loves to work and spin all day "And then, at night, she likes to play "Her web is like my mother's hair "Her eyes have got my father's stare "She may not jump, or twist, or bend "But a spider's a girl's best friend" Did you like it?
It's sweet, but I'm still sad.
This is my favorite picture of you when you were so young and beautiful.
Were?
I still am.
Oh, sure, but now it's only on the inside.
Inside, huh?
Well, I'm gonna put it on the outside.
Hi.
I don't believe it.
- You don't believe what?
- See for yourself.
I don't believe it.
Yes.
Yes, we appreciate that.
Then we'll expect you right after dinner?
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
That's the hardest phone call I've ever had to make.
Yes, a far cry from making reservations for your mother at Barbara Benson's to making them at the Happy Valley Institute.
I just hope we did the right thing.
Well, you saw for yourself.
Pogo sticks, jump rope.
Right now, she's upstairs playing cops and robbers.
Stick 'em up!
Don't worry, querida, Dr. Jonley has a fine reputation.
One look at Granny, and he'll know exactly what to do for her.
Oh, Gomez, I don't know what would've become of me if I hadn't met you.
You were fortunate, my dear.
How about a go at the trains, just to relax?
Splendid idea.
I'll operate the switches.
You can blow up the train.
Oh, no, darling, you blow up the trains.
I know how you love those wrecks.
Naturally.
I had one go through the ceiling yesterday.
- You didn't.
- Oh, yeah.
Shower of plaster and everything.
You've been practicing.
Used some of Pugsley's TNT.
Young fellow really knows how to mix an explosive.
Makes a mother proud.
All right, my dear, as soon as the last car clears this tunnel, count three and - Wonderful.
- All right, start them up.
Faster.
Faster.
Let them go wild.
Maybe one of them will fly off the track.
Yes, darling, yes.
I love runaway trains.
All right, now, as soon as the train clears the tunnel Now, that's what I call a real mystery.
Fester must have been fooling around with this.
Something like this always happens when he does.
Beautiful.
Didn't hit the ceiling.
Darling, you can't win them all.
How do you do, Mrs. Addams?
I'm Dr. Jonley.
I'm Mr. Addams.
This is Mrs. Addams.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
It must be the light, or maybe it's my glasses.
It is my glasses.
I'm not wearing them.
I'm so sorry.
I'm Dr. Jonley.
- How do you do, Mrs. Addams?
- How do you do?
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you.
Doctor, we asked you to stop by because a member of our family has been behaving, well, strangely.
I understand.
And we thought perhaps by your talking Hi!
Oh, he should be put away immediately.
Oh, no, he's not the one.
Fester, this is the head Oh, I'm sorry, I got no time now.
Big news.
Gotta see Granny.
Well, nice talking to you.
Dear, would you tell Granny we'd like to see her?
Roger.
Bye!
Are you sure he's not the one?
Just a minute.
Come in.
Okay, you can forget the kid stuff.
I wish I could.
It's making me old fast.
Well, I got big news for you.
You mean they're gonna send me away anyway?
Yep, but not to the home for the aged.
That's something that Gomez is building.
They're sending you to a beauty farm.
A beauty farm?
Yeah, it was a surprise, but I got Pugsley and Wednesday to tell me.
What a relief.
Yeah, they wanna see you downstairs.
There's some fella there.
I think he runs the place.
Just a minute.
One thing I don't understand.
What's that?
Why they wanna send me to a beauty farm.
Pogo stick.
The jumping rope.
They're typical regressions to a second childhood.
Yes, yes, yes, these things are very difficult to handle at the home level.
But at Happy Valley, there's something wrong with a patient who isn't jumping rope or dancing the Watusi.
Morticia?
Oh, there you are.
Mother, this gentleman is here You needn't explain, Morticia.
I know all about the place, and I'm all for it.
You are?
Oh, well, isn't that nice?
Could be a real lifesaver.
Oh, Gomez, I'm not that bad.
- Am I?
- No, no, no, not at all.
These cases have to be handled with kid gloves.
Who told you about our place?
Oh, I've heard about it for years.
Some of my best friends have been there.
Granny, we don't want you to get the idea that we're trying to get rid of you.
Get rid of me?
Why, I want to go.
There's one thing we must insist on, though, and that's a quiet room.
I do hope your walls are well insulated.
We have a few where the walls are padded.
Oh, Gomez, I don't know how much extra it would cost, but I would certainly like to have one of those.
One padded room coming up.
Oh, I may never want to leave.
Let's go.
You can ship my things, Morticia.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Looks like we did the right thing.
Oh, the poor dear, she's further gone than I thought.
Well, as long as it makes her happy.
Tokyo, Fujiyama Osaka It's a little something I composed, darling.
Do you like it?
I don't know about the melody, but I love the words.
Yes, the words are the best part.
Darling, you've been hanging there for three hours.
Aren't you getting a little tired?
Tired?
This is the perfect way to relax.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
It's from my mother.
How's she getting along?
She's doing nicely.
Listen to this.
"I really like this place.
You meet a very nice class of people.
"Though I'm looking much better, "Dr. Jonley thinks I might have to stay a lot longer than he thought.
"Love, Mother".
I knew it.
It's her kind of place.
Mother, what are you doing here?
Some beauty farm.
There wasn't a person there who could give me a permanent.
Don't worry, darling, I can tell just by looking at you that you're all well.

They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Uncle Fester, what're you doing?
Well, I'm waxing my head.
It's all part of the national beautification program.
The national beautification program?
Yes, it was on TV.
You see, the White House wants everybody to join in making everything in the country more beautiful.
And did you ever see my head look more beautiful?
Oh, yes, it is lovely.
Yeah, it's that hard coat.
That's very patriotic of you, Uncle Fester.
I think Gomez and I should join in the program, too.
Besides, there are a lot of lovely things I've been wanting to buy.
- Three oranges!
- Oh, what did you get, dear?
Three oranges!
How's the unpacking coming?
These shopping sprees are so exhausting.
What's in this alligator case?
An alligator.
Nice pet for Pugsley.
No.
I'm thinking of doing this room over, dear, in sort of Early Zoo.
That sounds wonderful.
We do have a good start, but tampering with perfection?
It's all part of the national beautification program, dear.
I think everyone should do their bit.
But I would like to bring beauty into the lives and homes of others as well.
Who better than you, cara mia, with your exquisite taste, to do that.
Darling.
But in order to inspire confidence, I need a showplace, a model home.
Querida, you've got one right here.
No, darling.
This house is a tribute to generations of Addams taste.
It took years to achieve its rare beauty.
I should start from scratch.
Just arrived.
Yes, thank you, Lurch.
Let's see.
Put it over there, please.
Carefully.
Carefully, don't bump it now.
Oh, yes.
Gently, Lurch, gently.
Thank you.
That'll be all.
- Darling, look.
- What is it?
Can't you guess?
We've never seen a canary that size before.
I'll give you a hint.
Tish, that sound sets my blood afire.
Mating cry of the Transylvanian vulture.
It is a Transylvanian vulture.
We should get a pair.
Oh, but I ordered two.
You naughty bird.
Morticia, you have impeccable taste.
Well, of course.
I married you, didn't I?
You know, sometimes I think it's wrong of me to keep you all to myself in a world starved for beauty.
I know what you mean.
For instance, our next-door neighbor, Mrs. Digby?
Every time she passes this house, she stares at it with that expression on her face that I've come to know so well.
Raw envy.
We certainly are surrounded by great beauty.
We should insure it.
That reminds me, isn't what's-his-name, Digby, our next door neighbor, isn't he an insurance man?
Let's give him the business.
- You mean, our good neighbor policy?
- Exactly.
But first, let me hear that wild music of the vulture's cry.
Darling, you promise you'll try to control yourself?
I'll try.
- They're at it again.
- Take it easy, honey.
After all, we never see them.
Well, it's almost worse this way, just hearing them.
We won't live next door to them forever.
Joe, we've been living next door to them for three weeks now and it seems like forever already.
We have got to get away.
Now!
Joe, please.
- Look, honey.
- Please.
Well, okay.
But if I don't get some business soon, we'll have to move again.
Into the street.
Well, even that would be an improvement.
- I think I'm gonna go lie down.
I just - Yeah.
Come in, the door is open.
Aha there, Digby!
Gomez Addams here.
My wife, Morticia, there.
How do you do, Mr. Digby?
- Won't you sit down, Mrs. Addams?
- No, thank you, Mr. Digby.
We'll come right to the point.
We'd like for you to insure our collection of objets d'art.
That's French.
Gomez, darling, please.
Darling, please.
Insurance now, objets later.
You want to insure something?
Yes, indeed.
How about 1,000,000?
Dollars?
That's very interesting.
How often do you have to water that table?
I'll draw up the papers immediately.
No hurry.
Just bring them by the house tomorrow.
And bring Mrs. Digby with you.
She's very shy.
Yes, I can tell that by the way she rushes past our house.
Besides, she's busy on our new home, working with decorators, you know.
Then you'll have to bring her.
Mrs. Addams is a superb decorator.
I'd be delighted to help.
- Help?
- Yes.
I'd not only feel I was helping a neighbor, but I'd be serving my country as well.
Oh, yes.
Sure.
If I know my wife, you'll get much more than you bargained for.
Darling.
Good day, Mr. Digby.
Digby, until tomorrow.
- All right now, Fester, you ready?
- Yeah.
One, two, three, heave!
Came out nice and clean.
I don't understand.
Delilah here gave the room such a lift.
- But Morticia needs her.
- What for?
Housewarming gift for our neighbors, the Digbys.
The Digbys!
Well, what about asking me first?
After all, blood is thicker than water.
Who said anything about giving blood?
After all, we don't know them that well.
The Digbys, that's all that Morticia thinks about now.
Well, Morticia always does give too much of herself.
She does?
Maybe she will give blood.
No.
Here it is, Morticia.
Isn't that beautiful?
I'm glad you're not giving them our live vulture, that'd be too much.
Even parting with Delilah leaves a hole in my life.
You should see the wall.
That must be the Digbys.
I'm almost afraid to let them see the house.
Might discourage them.
Darling, they're just going to have to be realistic.
After all, when we first moved in here, this house was bleak and gloomy.
Not everyone can start with that advantage.
The Digbys.
Welcome, welcome, welcome.
This is Mrs. Digby.
- How do you do.
- Mrs. Digby, we have a little something for you.
Say, that call is catching.
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, yes.
Poor dear is overcome by it all.
Now, just take a nice, deep breath.
Save a little for me.
- Joe, let's get out of here.
- Yes, dear.
Soon as we sign the papers.
Digby, how can you talk business at a time like this?
Besides, we haven't had a chance to get acquainted yet.
Well, you see, I'm a little tired You know, moving into a new house and finding a decorator Digby, didn't you tell her?
- Tell me what?
- You've found your decorator.
- I have?
Who?
- Me.
Hey, you've got a real fainter there.
Very feminine.
She's such a shy, sensitive soul.
I know we're going to get along famously.
No more smelling salts.
I feel better when I'm under.
Look, there must be some mistake.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it?
At your husband's urging, I've decided to do your house myself.
My husband's urging?
Surprise!
Well, now, if you ladies will excuse us, Mr. Digby and I will repair to the gallery.
I'd like to show him our new art objects.
Digby.
Now, dear.
I have some wonderful ideas for your new house.
And a most unusual color scheme.
- Oh?
- We'll start with the carpet.
Black.
- Black?
- Pitch.
Perhaps as a base - I suppose the curtains - Black.
- What about the wallpaper?
- Black.
And the furniture coverings?
Black?
No.
Off-black.
You must have some contrast, you know.
- Well, Digby, here's our gallery.
- Gallery?
Now, what were you saying about insurance?
Oh, all you have to do is sign and I'll have the company issue a floater.
No problem.
You rang?
A pen, please, Lurch.
Oh, thank you.
That'll be all, Lurch.
- There you are, Digby.
- Gee, thanks.
Thanks a million.
Oh, boy.
Beautiful, beautiful.
You know, I can hardly wait to see that collection of artworks of yours.
You don't have to wait.
You're surrounded by them.
These things?
I mean, these things.
Over here, Digby.
- An original Rembrandt.
- Rembrandt?
This says "Flugelsmith".
By george, it does.
These scribbled signatures.
Well, it's an original Flugelsmith.
Speaking of originals, feast your eyes on this.
Oh, a Stradivarius?
If it isn't, I'm out $12.50.
And, of course, there's my head of Tigi-Tigi, the Polynesian war chief.
- Bronze?
- Shrunken.
Now, as to your bedroom, I was thinking we might do the walls in salmon.
- Pink?
- No, scales.
How's the distaff side doing?
Oh, never mind about us.
Did he sign, Joe?
All signed, sealed and delivered.
- Well, nice to have seen you.
- Oh, but we're not even halfway through.
You haven't seen the lovely material I have for your new den.
- Hand-woven gunnysack.
- Good thinking, my dear.
Well, Mrs. Addams, you're very kind, but those lovely ideas of yours are too rich for my blood.
Blood.
That's exactly the color I planned for your guestroom.
I've decided to live with the things I have for a few more years.
Well, arrivederci.
Now, what was that all about?
It's obvious, darling.
Money.
Great Caesar's ghost, you're right.
That's why they were so overcome when they saw our house.
They couldn't afford it and they were too proud to admit it.
The poor darlings.
They were even too proud to accept our lovely gift.
That must really have broken their hearts.
Let's send it over to their home.
We'll have Lurch deliver it.
Hey, wait a minute.
Why don't you ask me?
Excellent idea, Fester.
You deliver it.
No, I meant, ask me whether I happen to want it.
Why, of course you do.
But that's the only kind of gift that's worth giving.
Something that means something to you.
I don't like giving away precious family heirlooms.
Lurch, get the car.
We'll take something else over there instead.
Some of that junky furniture we got up in the attic.
Antique Sheraton sideboard they stuck up there.
I know it's awful, but, you know, beggars can't be choosers.
And the first one that blabs anything about this to Morticia is a rotten egg.
No, better make that a spoilsport.
I like rotten eggs.
- Hi.
- Wow.
Watch it, Lurch.
Narrow there.
What's this?
Just a little housewarming present.
Mrs. Addams thought you might prefer this to a stuffed vulture.
Prefer it?
Why, isn't that an authentic Sheraton?
- Well - Why, that must be priceless!
Well, I think it's worth something.
I must telephone Mrs. Addams immediately.
No.
He's right.
I wouldn't do it.
- Why not?
- Well Morticia hates expressions of gratitude.
We'll just give her your message.
Bye!
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Hello?
Mrs. Addams, your beautiful gift just arrived.
I wanted to fill your home with things of equal beauty.
Nothing could make me happier, but we just don't have that kind of money.
Oh, think nothing of the expense, dear.
I have more things than I can use.
How can I ever thank you?
It's I who should be thanking you for letting me do my part in the national beautification program.
Well, whatever you say.
Joe and I are gonna be gone for a month and we won't be in your way, the whole house is yours.
Oh, I know after that lovely gift you sent over, you're gonna surprise me.
Oh, I will.
I will.
- Have a good trip, dear.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
Darling, I have decided to let Mrs. Addams do our new house after all.
Who are you calling?
Either a divorce lawyer or a psychiatrist, whichever one can get here first.
Mrs. Addams was just having her little joke.
Little joke, eh?
What makes you think so?
- That's what makes me think so.
- Oh.
- A housewarming gift from the Addams.
- Well Gomez, darling.
I've had an inspiration for the new Digby house.
Those lucky devils.
What is it this time?
I want to bring the garden right into the living room.
- Glass walls, eh?
- No, dirt floor.
There you are, Gomez.
Darling, I've just had the most marvelous idea about the Digby house.
You know, those big bay windows in the library, I'm going to have them all cemented in, walled up.
You think they'll like that?
Mrs. Digby will.
No window washing.
Gomez, darling, you're going to be so proud of me.
I have an idea for the Digby house that will be my piece de résistance.
French.
Darling, please, later.
Let me tell you my idea first.
- Let me tell you mine.
- Mine comes first.
Oh, that idea.
Now, darling, what is the most wasted space in a house?
- The ceiling.
- No, dear, the cellar.
- Of course.
- I've solved it.
I've had Lurch go over to the Digbys' and flood it.
- Flood it?
- An indoor swimming pool.
Tish, you've done it!
The model American home.
Not yet.
There's still the landscaping.
Yes, the landscaping.
Darling, I want you to see this with your own eyes.
Would you believe it?
That garden used to be full of roses and geraniums and unsightly camellias, and, in just one week, Lurch and I did that.
- That's a miracle.
- Thank you, darling.
Beautiful touch, my dear.
Well, when Mrs. Digby sees all this, I'll have the smelling salts ready.
Darling, there's a car driving up.
It must be the Digbys.
Welcome home.
Digbys!
Welcome home.
Well, what do you two think of your little love nest now?
What did I tell you?
Excellent idea, my dear.
To leave the Digbys in private to savor the beauty of their new home.
I do hope it didn't take Mr. Digby too long to revive her.
He must be an old hand at it by now.
- Are you expecting anyone, dear?
- I certainly am.
A whole parade of people on the Digbys' recommendation.
The Digbys.
- Mrs. Addams - Please, say no more.
I can read your feelings on your face.
Mrs. Addams, I can understand some of the things you did to my house, but why?
Why a wrecked car right smack in the middle of the living room?
I knew that would get them.
You see, I feel that a person's home should reflect their personality.
A wrecked car?
Well, that reflects your husband's work in insurance.
Pretty clever.
Did you notice the crushed fenders?
That is the original rust on them.
- I think I'm gonna faint again.
- Could you hold it a moment, please?
We have a small favor to ask.
Well, I have a bigger favor.
You can take all that stuff But that's just the favor we were going to ask you.
You can take all that That That was the favor you were gonna ask us?
Well, it's more in the nature of a sacrifice for your country.
You see, we want to make your home a showplace.
Open it to the public.
It's all part of the national beautification program.
Of course, we insist on your having a profit.
Please, please, anything you say.
It's a deal.
Real Americans, eh, darling?
And if there's anything you'd like to keep, why, I'm sure we can replace it.
Oh, well, now, there was just one piece.
I don't know what happened to it.
It was a Sheraton sideboard.
Oh, that.
It was obviously a mistake.
You like that?
I thought it was rather, you know, amusing.
- Say no more.
We have a whole atticful.
- It's all yours.
Now, now we can really get to work on your new home.
Just a minute.
- You see, we're planning on leaving town.
- Oh, yeah.
Well, perhaps I can be of some assistance.
- Gomez has interests all over the world.
- He has?
Well, there must be one place he doesn't have any interests.
Come to think of it there is one.
Timbuktu.
Funny thing you should mention Timbuktu.
That's just where we're going.
Isn't that strange?
Gomez, darling.
Does it strike you as odd that nobody has been inside my model home?
They just glance in the door and walk on.
Well, the house is obviously too far ahead of its time.
Frank Lloyd Wright had the same problem.
I don't even think the Digbys appreciated it.
- Nice people, but a bit crude.
- Yes.
That Sheraton sideboard was a dead giveaway.
At least they helped us clean the rest of the stuff out of the attic.
What's the matter, darling?
No more sword swallowing?
The thought of that Digby house in Timbuktu ruined my appetite.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Ready, my dear?
Clean kills, every one of them.
Why don't we use the good china?
Get a much a zippier ping when it shatters.
Darling, that is the good china.
Gomez, I think I've had enough.
Querida, you've been in a blue funk all day.
Perhaps a change of scenery will help.
Why don't we go to a drive-in movie?
Gomez, darling, why don't you keep your mind on the problem?
- It is, it is.
- No, dear.
I mean my sister Ophelia's problem.
Oh, that problem.
Poor jilted darling.
Her heart must be broken by now.
That Montrose makes the fifth man this year to get away from her.
Sixth!
Humphrey was the fifth.
Lucky devil.
Gomez!
Let's face it.
Ophelia may be your older sister, but in the school of romance, I'm afraid she's just a dropout.
Well, I admit she is a bit aggressive.
But after all, that's because she has so much to give.
You can say that again.
You remember that fellow Stanislaus she used to date?
Well, she gave him a concussion and two broken arms.
And they weren't even going steady.
Well, a girl must keep up with her judo and her karate.
Anyway, I expect her here soon.
And while she's staying with us I do think we should try and lighten her burden.
I shall be the soul of compassion and understanding.
Fester, what are you up to?
I'm making you some more skeet targets.
Miss Ophelia.
Oh, you poor girl, what happened?
Montrose didn't like that.
Spoilsport.
Where is my sweet, gentle sister, Morticia?
She said she was gonna arrange lunch.
But she may be hiding.
Oh, dear brother-in-law, I am the most miserable of people.
You've got me there.
I think I'll end it all.
I'll tell Morticia there will be one less for lunch.
Gomez!
Suicide on an empty stomach?
It's very unhealthy.
Ophelia!
Uncle Fester, I'm so unhappy.
Oh, you poor kid, what happened?
Montrose didn't like that.
He sure must be a weird one.
Darling Ophelia.
Oh, Sister Morticia, I'm so bereft.
Ophelia, it pains to me to see you so unhappy.
What happened?
Gomez, dear, this is no time for games.
Come, Ophelia, sit down and tell me all about it.
But skip the judo.
Here you are, Morticia.
I hardly know where to begin.
Well, suppose you start at the beginning.
Gee, Gomez, your shell collection is getting real big.
Uncle Fester, please.
Go ahead, Ophelia.
Well Thank you, Thing.
Don't take it so hard, Ophelia.
This isn't the first time you've been left holding the bag.
Uncle Fester, that will be quite enough!
I had the most divine ceremony planned.
The canopy was going to be gray wolf bane with accents of water lilies, wilted.
You always did have an eye for decorating.
We were going to take a three-week honeymoon cruise on the African Queen.
By george, the man must be mad, not sticking around for a fun time like that.
He didn't even say goodbye.
All I got was a telegram saying he was joining the Peace Corps and going to the Arctic Circle.
Nice country.
Help.
That thing had a hurricane building up inside of it.
I don't see what's so funny.
Pray forgive me, Uncle Fester.
It just suddenly occurred to me how much you look like my dear Montrose.
In fact, you two could be twins.
The Peace Corps.
Imagine that precious tub of lard getting into the Peace Corps.
A fine way to talk about your uncle!
As if the Peace Corps wouldn't jump at a chance to have me join.
No, Uncle Fester, Ophelia wasn't talking about you.
There may have been certain similarities between you and her description of Montrose.
- But I don't think - Sure.
If she was laughing at Montrose, she was laughing at me and my chances of getting into the Peace Corps.
Well, let me tell you something.
There is great big world out there just begging for a chance to use my brains and talent.
And to prove it, I am joining the Peace Corps.
- I'm - Uncle Fester!
I think it's wonderful.
- What?
This?
- Yes.
No.
No, I mean, your joining the Peace Corps.
Maybe you could find my Montrose for me.
He's my true, true love.
Uncle Fester.
Think of all the help you could give to people in other countries.
After all, who knows more about building moats and drawbridges than you?
Say no more, my dear.
An old school chum of mine is a bigwig in Washington.
I'll give him a call and get the ball rolling.
Congratulations, old man, you're as good as in.
Can I look now?
I'm dying of curiosity.
Not yet.
It's you, but something's missing.
Did you get my daisies?
Oh, yes, especially the ones growing in your head.
Beautiful.
Oh, hi.
I'm making a study schedule for my Peace Corps exams next week, and you girls promised to help me.
So, now let's see.
I've got from 10:00 to 11:00 open and from 5:00 till 6:00.
Which shall I put you down for, Morticia?
I feed my plants from 10:00 to 11:00.
Oh, dear.
I generally weed my head from 10:00 to 11:00.
But I guess I could rearrange my day.
Okay.
Swell!
With you girls helping me, I'm a cinch to pass.
I feel a weed growing up there.
Oh, I'll get it.
That's a daisy.
Very deep roots.
Oh, sorry.
There, got it!
Thank you, Uncle Fester.
You are a dear.
Yeah, I guess there's just no use fighting it.
You know something, Morticia?
That ice really captures Ophelia's warm personality.
All right now.
"The examination will cover general and specific topics.
"And you will be required "to answer questions based on a wide field of knowledge.
"Now, the following are typical examples of questions that may be asked".
Are you ready?
- Shoot.
- All right, here we go.
"What is the first aid treatment for a snake bite"?
Oh, that's a cinch.
You take the snake and wrap him in a nice warm blanket so he won't go into shock.
- Right?
- It certainly is.
But that's not the answer they have here.
I can't understand how they'd slip up on a misprint like this.
Maybe that's an old book.
Try another question.
All right.
"The Peace Corps mission is to make friends.
"Now, what would you do "if you were invited to a feast in a native village "and were served such local delicacies "as sautéed bat wings, "brisket of warthog and sweet and sour scorpion stew"?
I wouldn't touch it with a 10-foot pole.
Whoever heard of mixing sautéed bat wings and brisket of warthog?
Ready for the next question, Uncle Fester?
Just as soon as I get this nice and tight.
And I wanna thank you for taking time off to help me study.
There!
All right, Wednesday, shoot.
"Many of the countries low below the equator "where the average rainfall exceeds "what would you consider the people's greatest need"?
Umbrellas.
Oh, Uncle Fester.
Canoes?
Now the swing shift is here.
I'll take over, Wednesday.
Thank you.
Now, Uncle Fester, this is very, very tricky.
You have to make sure that all these pegs fit into their proper holes.
Oh, yeah, we had one of these things around here before.
And you have 45 seconds to do it in.
Commence.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, this is fun.
Anything that comes easily is fun, dear.
All right.
Hey, that's a toughie.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
Perfect!
45 seconds exactly.
However, Thing did help you with that last one.
Oh, don't worry.
When I take the test, I'll bring my own mallet.
I was truly magnificent.
I bogeyed the fourth, seventh and ninth holes.
I sliced in the quicksand on the 12th.
I evaded Mama's alligator on the 14th, and I got a birdie on the 18th.
I think it was a hawk.
It was flying too high to be sure.
Just think, last year you were a rank amateur.
It's perseverance.
Where's Fester?
I haven't seen him around much since he started studying for that Peace Corps exam.
He's in training.
Dear, dear Uncle Fester, that's what I like.
Always one step ahead of me.
One step ahead of you?
I got one foot in the grave.
Now, now.
You have to get into the Peace Corps so you can find my Montrose.
So, on with our pushups.
Now then.
"Legs straight, "arms bent at the side, "head down, "246 times".
Oh, that's my mistake.
That's the page number.
Got to get you nice and firm.
Straighten up.
And one.
We'll have to find some exercises for that ground.
It needs firming up, too.
Now blow on it first, Cleopatra, it's a very hot pizza.
That's mother's baby.
Morticia, have you seen Fester?
It's time for his vitamin shot.
I think he's with Ophelia.
You silly girl.
You'll get tomato sauce all over his jacket.
You know, dear, she really has a thing for you.
I think she needs a soul mate.
Capital idea.
I'll call my office in Nairobi, have them send over a male African strangler.
Cleopatra, you're a real flirt.
A true Addams.
Well, gotta find Fester.
Fester!
Fester!
Fester!
Zounds!
Looks like I'll have to cut down on the dosage.
Addams here.
- Washington calling?
- Gomez, darling Simpson on the phone from Washington.
Just spoke to the Peace Corps about Fester.
Simpson, have they decided yet where they want to assign him?
Yes.
Yes, I see.
Well, thanks for the old college try, Simpson.
What's the matter, darling?
Where are they going to send him?
Nowhere.
They were impressed.
As a matter of fact, the staff psychologist said he wished that Fester would commit himself for five or ten years.
Imagine that.
Darling, then why aren't they going to send him anywhere?
Well, it seems there's no country in the world ready at the present time to accept Fester's talents.
Uncle Fester is rather advanced.
Oh, dear, this is going to come as quite a blow to Ophelia as well.
Well, I'd better tell him now.
No sense in him getting into condition for nothing.
Wait a minute, darling, I have an idea.
You know how proud and independent Uncle Fester is.
Yes, he'll be crushed when he finds out they don't need him.
Absolutely.
So we must make him feel he's more needed here at home.
Make it his decision not to go into the Peace Corps.
Capital idea!
We can't tell Ophelia either.
You know how eager she is for him to find her Montrose.
I'll talk to her later.
Fester won't be difficult.
He's a level-headed fellow.
And I know just how to handle it.
You look a little distressed, Gomez.
Going to end it all.
Is something wrong?
Well, I might as well tell you, Fester, I'm ruined, wiped out.
That's impossible!
You're worth a fortune.
Was, was, Fester.
I was worth a fortune.
But now I'm just another member of the Great Society.
Well, only last week you bought a railroad and an airline and a skateboard factory.
Yes, I was known all along Wall Street as the go-go magnate.
Now it's all gone, gone, gone, gone!
There's only one way, Fester.
I can make sure Morticia and the children and the rest of the family will have something.
I hope that insurance premium check doesn't bounce.
Goodbye, Fester.
You can have my trains, blasting caps.
Oh, gee, thanks.
For a minute there I was sorry to see you go.
Fester, Fester, what about the children?
Don't worry about them.
They can play with the trains all they want.
Fester, Fester, children must have a father.
There must There must be some way, some way out.
Someone, someone with a computer, a computer for a brain.
A cold, ruthless financial wizard might turn the tables.
Where?
Where can I find someone like that?
- You're looking at him.
- You?
It's not for nothing that they call me gold finger.
But, gee, that'd mean I'd lose the trains and the blasting caps.
I'll buy you the trains and the blasting caps.
Well, in that case Morticia, your paintings.
May I have a match please?
You're gonna burn them?
I tried calling the trash man, but he doesn't pick up on Fridays.
Well, in that case But, Morticia, these are your masterpieces.
They somehow seem so meaningless.
I seem to have lost contact with my creative soul.
Yeah, so I see.
But then, every great painter goes through a dry spell.
Yes.
If only I had some new challenge.
A stimulating model perhaps.
A new model?
- You found him.
- You?
Uncle Fester, that's it.
Don't move.
But, Morticia, I've been so busy helping Gomez get back on his feet.
Why, only yesterday I told him to buy, buy, buy.
Buy, buy, buy?
Yeah, I meant sell, sell, sell.
But it was too late.
He bought and it went up and You see, he needs me.
Oh, yes.
And besides, the Peace Corps will be yelling for me very soon.
But, Uncle Fester, I need you so desperately, too.
You and the world.
Maybe I can squeeze you in.
Uncle Fester, you are an angel.
An angel!
That's it.
Uncle Fester, you've done it again.
I can feel my creative juices surging through my veins.
That's wonderful, Morticia, but I I think I better come down now.
My creative juices aren't doing so well.
Just this final touch.
Gomez is asleep up in the tower, but I know he'll be thrilled when he sees this.
Hold it, hold it just a moment.
Tish, you spoke French.
Will you please get me down?
Darling, please, the rope.
Yes, the rope.
- Hurry, bubele.
- Bubele.
That name!
Fester, dear, are you all right?
I'm okay, but Look at my bugle.
Hey, what do you know?
It's back in tune again.
This is the most important decision I have ever made.
But I've made it.
I've decided not to join the Peace Corps.
- I'll answer the door.
- Lurch'll get the door.
What about my Montrose?
You promised you'd get him back for me.
So I did.
Okay, the Peace Corps.
How will I get along without your financial advice?
That's true.
Okay, I'm out.
You mean I'm doomed to a life of spinsterhood?
I'm in again.
Uncle Fester, you're my sole inspiration.
I'm out again.
I want my Montrose.
I'm in and out.
Gentleman for Miss Ophelia.
- Montrose!
- Baby!
I sure missed that.
Montrose, my love.
Home at last.
How could I ever leave the only woman who told me how I reminded her of Richard Burton?
Richard Burton?
Never!
You know who he reminds me of?
James Bond.
Thank you, Thing, that's much better.
By george, Morticia, this picture you painted on the head of a pin is a dandy.
Thank you, darling.
I know how much you enjoy those battle scenes.
Gomez, would you come outside and help me hang up this sign?
Sign?
What for?
Well, it seems a shame to waste all that wonderful physical training I got.
So I'm gonna open up my own Peace Corps physical fitness center.
That's very good thinking, Uncle Fester.
But doesn't the Peace Corps have a training program of their own?
What do I care?
I got my first student without even putting up the sign.
Wonderful!
Who's your new student?
You rang?
One more.
One.

They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family That Uncle Tom 's Cabin sure packs a wallop.
They say Latin is a dead language.
Thank you, culture lovers.
Oh, hello, darlings.
You just missed your father's Latin hour.
How was school today?
Back to reality, eh, children, from a world of fantasy?
Wednesday, Pugsley?
What's the matter, children?
Oh, I know, you got A's again.
Worse.
That cranky old principal scolded us for having fun at recess.
Recess?
If I remember correctly, I flunked that three times.
Tough.
But why on earth would the principal scold you?
Search us.
We were just showing the kids how to shoot dynamite caps.
Well, it seems harmless enough.
At least they weren't frittering away their time with marbles.
But he got real mad when one of the kids blew up the teeter-totter.
He didn't follow my instructions, and the principal said if we ever played with dynamite again, he'd expel us.
Expel you?
He can't do that.
Can he?
After all, darling, he is the principal.
You children run along now and play.
Gomez, if that principal denies our children normal self-expression, they're liable to become frustrated and warped.
You're right.
We don't want them bitter and suspicious of their fellow men.
I think we ought to transfer them to another school.
Those public schools, they're all the same.
No, no, no, I mean a private school.
Darling, do you remember Mr. Hilliard?
Hilliard?
Hilliard.
Oh, the fellow who used to be the truant officer.
The very one.
I've heard he's running a marvelous private school called Mockridge Hall.
That's it then.
Mockridge Hall.
I'll ring up Hilliard right away.
As old Erasmus Addams once said, "You've got to take the bull by the teeth".
Teeth?
Some people here to see you.
If there are more bill collectors, I'm out.
Our bank account is absolutely Oh, they said their name was Addams.
- Addams?
One "D" or two?
- They didn't say.
- Did they seem a little - Quite a little.
Miss Ames, I just remembered a dental appointment, and I can hardly wait to get there.
Mr. Hilliard, what a charming surprise!
You see, Gomez, it is our old friend.
Hilliard, old bean, you just sort of dropped out of sight.
Yeah, I certainly tried.
You're the only truant officer our children ever missed.
We wondered if you were still with the public school system?
No, no, that didn't work out, thanks to you.
Our pleasure, old man, and a shrewd move on your part, too.
You do remember our remarkable offspring?
Pugsley and Wednesday.
Names that haunt even my happiest hours.
Mr. Hilliard, what a lovely compliment!
In that case, Hilliard, you'll be more than delighted to know that we are again placing them in your capable hands.
Oh, no.
We want to enroll them in Mockridge Hall immediately.
The public school system is stifling their creative talents.
I can imagine.
Well, that's that.
Come, my dear, we'll fetch our offspring at once.
Just a moment.
I'm afraid there's a slight complication.
Yes, the tuition.
No problem at all.
You name it.
No, it isn't that.
You see, we have a very limited enrolment.
And at the moment, there are absolutely no openings.
Well, you see, we have just so many desks.
As a matter of fact, I had to turn down somebody this morning.
Oh, but, Mr. Hilliard, there must be some way.
No way.
No way at all, Mrs. Addams.
I'm sorry, but there's absolutely no possibility of You see, we have just so many desks.
Well, there's your answer.
Two more desks, no problem.
Will $10,000 cover it?
As you can see, my husband has the ability to solve the most insurmountable problems.
Come on, my pet, we'll find the children at once.
Gomez, look.
I had no idea Mr. Hilliard was such a sentimentalist.
Weeping for joy.
You, too?
Every school loves a military touch.
We just had to show our appreciation by giving this school this cannon.
But why does it have to be my cannon?
How can I face that empty room tonight?
Uncle Fester, it's for the children.
Well, in that case, you better let me sight it in, in case they decide to use it.
In case they decide to use it?
Fester, this cannon will be an absolute must at jousting, regattas, polo and curling events.
I would estimate a five-knot breeze from the direction of the glue factory.
The glue factory?
That's dinner.
Yes.
Good shot, Fester.
Too bad the chief lost his fighting spirit when Geronimo quit.
Children, home from dear old Mockridge Hall so soon?
They let Pugsley and me come home in the middle of our first class.
I'll wager the pets were a smash hit.
When my octopus gave the teacher a hug, she got so flustered she rang the fire alarm.
Dear Aristotle, he's such an affectionate creature.
Sometimes I worry about the way he takes up with total strangers.
And did teacher like your Gila monster?
She got so thrilled that she called for Mr. Hilliard to come and see it, and then she got so excited that she fainted.
Anyone who likes animals that much has got it here.
Next pet day you should take Mama's alligator.
- Do you think she'll let us?
- Well, why don't you ask her?
She's downstairs in the basement wrestling with him now.
I nearly forgot.
Mr. Hilliard sent you a note.
A personal note from Mr. Hilliard.
Isn't that thoughtful?
Man's a pure thoroughbred, Tish.
Thank you, Thing.
Smartest thing we ever did, enroll the children at Mockridge Hall.
Gomez, darling, I don't understand this.
I think it's some sort of joke.
Oh, Hilliard, he's a laugh a minute.
What is it this time?
Well, he says the children are permanently expelled.
He even suggests a psychiatrist.
"No amount of money in this world is sufficient".
Morticia, this man sounds irrational.
He does need a psychiatrist.
I'll call him right now and get things squared away.
Darling, don't you think I'd better call?
You're apt to be a bit excited.
You're right, my dear.
Where the welfare of my children is concerned, I'm a snarling wolf at bay.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
Hello?
May I speak with Mr. Hilliard, please?
Mrs. Addams calling.
What did he say?
I'm afraid you're right, dear.
The poor man is irrational.
- I could hardly understand him.
- Did you get the gist of it?
Well, he babbled something about Board of Regents and the faculty.
He said the children would be a menace in any school.
Poor devil, he's not responsible.
Being pressured by higher-ups.
I'm afraid you're right.
But what do we do about the children?
What about their schooling?
Morticia, there are some things that money just won't buy.
And some things it will.
Mockridge Hall, for instance.
Crackling good notion.
We'll buy the place, run it as it should be run, and take the pressure off of Hilliard.
Oh, I wish I could be there when that wonderful man hears the good news.
You will, you will, my dear.
It will be another glorious chapter in Addams history.
A new institution of higher learning is born.
Darling, how did you ever happen to think of such an original name?
Just came to me.
Darling, why don't you relax?
You must be utterly exhausted.
The chancellor of Addams Hall has little time for creature comforts, my dear.
Remember, tempus fungus.
That, too.
Gomez!
I consider it an honor to serve under you as dean of demolition and dynamite.
- You're the perfect man for it, Fester.
- You could get electronics.
Oh, sure.
It must be Mr. Hilliard.
Straight faces, everyone.
Remember, save the surprise until last.
Mr. Hilliard.
- Hey, old man, come in, come in.
- What a pleasant surprise.
For some obscure reason, the Board of Regents ordered me to stop by here.
Board of Regents, eh?
They do push you around a lot, don't they?
They must be a constant thorn in your side.
Oh, our relationship is most cordial, and we quite concur on the matter of your children, if that's the reason Brave try, old man, but there's no need to cover up for them any longer.
They're off your back for good.
What are you driving at?
You will be delighted to know that there's an entirely new Board of Regents.
Pardon?
You don't possibly mean that you Right as rain.
We have purchased Mockridge Hall.
Lock, stock and you.
Me?
Me!
We insist you remain as headmaster.
We feel sure you'll fit in perfectly with the new plans we have.
Plans?
Yeah, I've given my department a lot of thought.
- Your department?
- Exactly.
With the exception of the headmaster, you, we have replaced the entire faculty.
Hilliard, old man, come here.
We've assembled the most advanced teaching aids in the country.
Look at this.
Visual aids make strong impressions on young minds.
- Professor Fester, will you oblige?
- I'll be glad to.
However, visual combined with audio really are truly effective.
Observe.
Watch.
In a right isosceles triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the square of the opposite two sides.
This is a recording.
What child could resist that?
Look, Mrs. Addams And, Hilliard, you'll be pleased to hear that we're de-emphasizing all of the snap courses like English, Science, Mathematics Pugsley, when he was born, was already up to calculus.
Wednesday recited The Raven her first day.
Now, we're going back to the real fundamentals.
Advanced head shrinking.
Yes, that ought to be a required course.
And a crash course in theoretical taxidermy.
Yes, and freshman dynamite one and two.
I'll be teaching that, of course.
I wouldn't dare trust it to anyone else.
Oh, this is insanity!
And Mama has got some marvelous ideas for the home economics class.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch.
Would you mind bringing Mama's contribution to the home economics class?
Thank you.
Show it to Mr. Hilliard.
- Baked mongoose.
- No, thank you, I just ate.
Save it for later, Lurch.
Don't tell me that's part of the faculty, too.
Thing is our new attendance monitor.
Mr. And Mrs. Addams, it's simply incredible that you'd expect a man of my scholastic reputation to turn the curriculum of Mockridge Hall into complete bedlam.
- Addams Hall, Mr. Hilliard.
- We have complete confidence in you.
Cousin Itt, are you going to teach animal husbandry?
Of course.
Why didn't I think of that?
Raising our own sheepskin for our diplomas.
You can see how shrewd and practical we're gonna be.
Mr. Hilliard, isn't it exciting?
With our innovations and your experience, Addams Hall will be famous in no time.
There's no doubt about that.
Well, now that we understand each other, have you any suggestions, Hilliard, old man?
Yes, yes, I do have a suggestion.
I suggest you get a new headmaster, I I'm leaving.
I retire.
I quit.
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
Who could've guessed at his mental state?
Poor devil.
Probably felt inadequate to the challenge.
Thunderation!
Where can we find a replacement?
I'll give it a whirl.
We may have to go to the ends of the earth to find a man with the suitable wit, intuition and wisdom for the position.
We don't even have to leave this room.
Look, dear.
Querida, you are indeed the wise one.
It's destiny.
Kismet.
You owe it to the youth of America.
You must assume the mantle.
Our school much prefers challenging your school to a jousting tournament.
But since jousting is not in your restricted curriculum, we accept your offer of polo.
Respectfully, etcetera, etcetera.
Beautiful shot, darling.
Good show, old paint.
Same time tomorrow.
Darling, I'll get that letter off with the others in a moment.
Querida, how can I bear this heavy burden without you at my side?
Darling, such rewarding work.
In only two short weeks absenteeism has completely disappeared.
All a question of intelligent presentation of subject matter.
Dear Uncle Fester, he just loves giving those finals.
Cousin Itt.
And how is our professor of speech therapy?
How nice.
You've been working with the porpoises today?
You have a progress report on tape?
Well, let's hear it.
That's incredible.
His lisp is completely gone.
Soon the porpoise will take over the class, and you can go back as instructor at the barber college.
Dear Cousin Itt, he fits in so perfectly.
He's all Addams.
Oh, dear, that must be the committee from the mothers' club.
They called earlier.
- Bully!
Show them in.
- Yes, darling.
Tish, you know what that French does to me.
Chancellor Addams, really!
Sorry, wrong arm.
I'm Mrs. Addams.
Welcome, gentle mothers, at your service.
We have come to verify the fantastic things our children have been telling us.
Classes in mine laying and do-it-yourself dentistry?
Would you like to tour the campus?
Thank you, but I think we've seen quite enough.
Mr. Addams, in this envelope is a resolution signed by the parent of every child in this school, except yours.
What an honor after such a short time in office.
Oh, I do hope it's suitable for framing.
It states that unless Mr. Hilliard and his programs are reinstated, every child in this school will be withdrawn at once.
And we do mean at once.
Mr. Hilliard, or an empty school.
Come, ladies.
Such dear, compassionate ladies.
Dear?
Compassionate?
Even though they're wrong, they can't bring themselves to let Mr. Hilliard down.
- It's blind loyalty.
- Lf I could only be certain.
Darling, why don't we go home?
In the proper surroundings, you'll see things in their true perspective.
Lurch should be back by now.
Slow.
What's the correct time, pet?
Thank you, my dear.
It's a noble thing you're about to do, Gomez.
Confronted with your relentless logic, my dear, I have no choice.
Oh, Mr. Hilliard, how nice of you to drop by.
Drop by?
I was brutally kidnapped by that one-man goon squad.
Same old Hilliard.
He can charm the birds out of the trees.
Mr. Hilliard, we have such lovely news for you.
You mean I can go?
No, no, no.
Not until you have some refreshment.
Why does it have to be me?
Always me.
- Here you are.
- No.
We like the cut of your jib, Hilliard.
We need you back at the school.
I'll take that after all, Mrs. Addams.
Your presence at the school is an absolute must, Mr. Hilliard.
Why can't I make you understand that wild horses wouldn't drag me And the fierce, if somewhat blind, loyalty of our mothers should not go unrewarded.
And feast your eyes on this, old sport.
The new financial report.
Why, the school is financially independent forever.
I simply don't understand.
Now that my husband has brought the school out of its scholastic doldrums as well, we feel confident that you will follow the trail he's blazed.
If I did return, I'd have to be in complete charge.
- Oh, I'd insist on that.
- Then it's agreed.
Wait a minute, let's understand each other.
- I'm to run the school as I see fit?
- Exactly.
No catches.
Well, we'll be honest with you.
There is one.
I knew it.
Fester stays on as dean of demolition.
I knew it, I knew it!
- Wait, wait till I get to the catch.
- There's more?
You see, he's working on a rather complicated project here at home.
It may be years before you can actually have him.
I think I can make the sacrifice.
Good news, Uncle Fester.
Mr. Hilliard's coming back to school.
Well, the way things are going, I'll need an extended leave.
Problems with the project?
Yeah.
I got the whole formula backwards.
It's supposed to blow up, not down.
Mr. Hilliard, it's too bad you can't have him sooner.
He's such a perfectionist.
If only the music appreciation class could have heard that.
Off to school, children?
Well, give our best to Mr. Hilliard.
Father, we don't like private school anymore.
It's no fun now that you're not there.
That's a point.
We want to go back to public school.
Very well, on one condition.
That you keep up your home studies with Uncle Fester and Grandmama.
We'll keep up our home studies.
We promise.
Wait until the principal sees us again.
Come on, Pugsley.
Oh, boy.
I can hardly wait to see his face.
It turns such a pretty purple.
Bye, children.
Oh, dear.
Back to public school again, after all that trouble.
But it served a purpose, Morticia.
Education's in my blood.
I can't quit.
- What do you mean, darling?
- It's a surprise, my dear, a surprise.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello, Watkins?
How's the deal?
Oh, Harvard wouldn't sell?
Well, too bad.
I wanted to get it for Mrs. Addams' birthday.
Well, keep trying old man.
Try Oxford, Yale, Princeton.
Gomez, how touching, darling!
You wanted to buy me Harvard for my birthday.
Come to think of it, it is rather a silly gift for a beautiful woman.
I should get you Vassar.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Hungry?
Picture in domestic tranquility.
Hemlock on the hearth, and my lovely wife feeding the piranha.
Next to you-know-what, they like pickled herring the best.
Good little eaters, aren't they?
Next to Kitty cat they're the best eaters in the house.
Oh, dear.
Morticia, Gomez.
Kitty cat didn't eat his dinner and he's acting so strangely.
See?
No pep, no energy.
Poor dear does look a bit under.
I tried everything to cheer him up.
I even stuck my head in his mouth up to there.
If that didn't cheer him up He's been making friends with that alley cat next door.
Scrunchy little thing, but maybe he wants a friend who's a cat.
Any kind of a cat.
Mama, you are so wise.
Kitty cat is of an age to marry and have a family.
Darling, why don't we send to Africa for a mate?
Send?
Send?
Querida, suppose I had just received you in the mail instead of stalking you as I did?
Morticia.
Those runs we had through Hurricane Dora.
By the time Typhoon Terry came, we were engaged.
Kitty cat must have the same chance.
Yes, darling.
You rang?
Lurch, begin preparations for a safari.
I'll tell the children.
A safari!
Is it true we're going to visit the happy hunting ground?
Yes, we're taking Kitty cat wife-shopping.
Well, let's get wives for everybody.
I'm ready.
You needn't go to Africa for yours, old man.
Oh, yes.
All the local girls have turned me down.
I can't imagine why.
Well, it's when I tell them I sleep on a bed of nails.
American girls just don't seem to like that.
True femininity is disappearing.
Darling, why don't I cable the white hunter and tell him to expect us?
Excellent idea, my dear.
Tell him accommodations for seven people, one lion, one alligator, one octopus and one spider.
Better forget the spider.
I like to travel light.
Yes, bwana.
When you call me bwana, my blood boils.
And how I love the sound.
- Did it come through?
- No, Uncle Fester.
Bravo, querida.
- Try this one.
- What's this one, dear?
It's what the Batulu tribe calls a kitku, or a far-carrying spear.
They use it against distant relatives.
- What's the number?
- That's the area code.
Very good.
What's this one, darling?
I believe that's a mashu klift.
A spear of great accuracy designed for use against tsetse flies.
- Oh, dear, that bell's out of order again.
- No problem.
You rang?
Lurch, a tsetse fly, please.
Ready?
Release.
Perfect hit.
- What?
- What?
You mean, you think Kitty cat may just have a cold?
By george, it never occurred to me.
Of course, it could be as simple as that.
Merely a case for the family doctor.
Family witch doctor, of course.
Well, to the telephone, my dear.
Do you remember Dr. Mbogo's number in Africa?
Zulu 854.
Oh, yes.
Thank you, my dear.
Person-to-person call to Dr. Mbogo in Africa.
Zulu What?
First name?
Just a moment.
- You remember Dr. Mbogo's first name?
- Mbogo.
Oh, yes, of course.
Mbogo.
I can never remember that.
Dr. Mbogo Mbogo, please.
Who did you want again?
Oh, Dr. Mbogo.
Wait a minute.
I'll see if I can get a hold of him.
Hold on.
We'll have to get ourselves a hollow log.
We'd save a lot of time by dialing direct.
Hello, Dr. Mbogo?
Gomez Addams here.
How are you, Doctor?
Oh, that's too bad.
Well, we have a little problem here ourselves.
Kitty cat.
Seems to be suffering from lack of appetite.
Yes.
Take three hairs from a wildebeest.
Mix with boiling water.
Burn down the hut?
I think the doctor had better come out and have a look.
Absolutely.
Doctor, I think you'd better come out and examine him personally.
Come on, Doctor, you ought to be used to that by now.
That's your final word, eh?
Well, as long as you feel that way.
- He refuses to come out and see Kitty cat.
- Refuses to see him?
Seems Kitty cat's father ate his father.
Well, you rustle up boiling water and some matches, and I'll go hunt up a wildebeest.
Darling, where are we going to find a wildebeest this time of year?
I think I saw one lurking in Mama's room.
Leave it to Mama.
I'll help you trap it.
But first, to the library for a little target practice.
Darling.
Cousin Itt, would you help us with the target practice, please?
- Ready?
- Ready.
You're getting warmer, darling.
Try it again.
Now, up to Mama's room and that wildebeest.
What?
It isn't a wildebeest, it's Mama?
Well, that lets out Dr. Mbogo.
Darling, I do believe Thing is right.
Why don't we call a veterinarian?
Well, a veterinarian isn't as scientifically advanced as Dr. Mbogo, but I guess we have no choice.
This one sounds rather reliable.
"AAAAA Animal Doctors.
For the pet who has everything".
AAAAAA Animal Doctors.
Gunderson speaking.
The health of your pet is our A-1 concern.
Are you calling in reference to a bird, dog or cat?
A cat.
Now, what are your cat's symptoms?
Well, he seems to have no appetite at all.
He hasn't eaten since yesterday, and then all he had was a leg of yak, some marinated cheetah and a soufflé of aardvark.
cheetah, soufflé of Sorry, there's something wrong with my phone.
Would you repeat that, please?
Yak, cheetah and a soufflé of aardvark.
What did you say your cat ate?
Leg of yak, some marinated cheetah, and a soufflé of aardvark.
I'd better come right over.
Yeah.
Dr. Gunderson.
Glad you could make it, Doctor.
Gomez Addams here.
- Nice to see you.
- Mrs. Addams there.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I do hope you can help Kitty cat.
We couldn't even tempt him with broiled elephant hooves.
Your cat likes broiled elephant hooves?
Doesn't everyone?
I'm going to lead you to the patient, Doctor, you must be very busy.
Well, only in the molting season.
You know Oh, I see the doctor finally got here.
Well, go to it, but don't make a federal case out of it.
Our family doctor could've cured him like that, but we didn't want to burn down the hut.
We've grown rather attached to it.
Your family doctor prescribed burning down the hut?
Well, some of his methods are a trifle extreme.
Well, does your family doctor think that maybe your cat has something highly infectious?
No.
I think Dr. Mbogo just enjoys a good fire.
Some of the doctor's medical theories may be questionable, but he is absolutely great on curses.
- Curses?
- A specialist.
This way, please.
This is Kitty cat's favorite room.
He really preferred the tree house, but there just isn't room for both of us.
He's probably in the tunnel.
Perhaps this will bring him out.
He loves to play circus.
Kitty cat, come on out.
The doctor's here.
That's Kitty cat?
He's such an obedient little darling.
- I think he likes you.
- Likes me?
That's what I was afraid of.
But, Doctor, don't you want to examine him?
Oh, no, I would not like to examine him.
I think the doctor wants to be alone with him.
- No.
No, I don't want to be.
- Very well.
We'll stand by you.
- Anything we can do for you?
- Yes, you can get me out of here, - because I - But Kitty cat needs you.
Oh, no.
You see, I don't know anything about lions.
You see, I'm really a bird man.
Honest.
I flunked wild beasts twice.
You're my kind of people.
I flunked everything twice.
Also, I'm a coward.
What's there to be afraid of?
Doctor, I think we're inhibiting you.
We'll go and you stay.
Oh, no.
I'll go, you stay.
Come on now, Doctor.
I know you can help Kitty cat.
Look at those gentle healing hands.
Now, do be sweet to him.
He's such a shy, sensitive thing.
- Don't go.
Wait a second.
- Doctor.
Fellows.
If there's anything you want, just yell.
Help!
Well, he doesn't have to yell that loud.
No, Uncle Fester, let's not indulge the doctor.
Well, I agree with you, but I don't know what you mean.
Didn't it strike you as strange that a veterinarian should be afraid of a harmless, little animal like Kitty cat?
By george, I think he was afraid.
You are a discerning one.
Poor man.
He needs help much more than Kitty cat.
The only sensible thing to do is to call Dr. Mbogo again.
No, let's work on Dr. Gunderson.
You know, build up his ego, restore his confidence.
Capital idea.
How?
Well, let him work on members of the family.
Make him think he's effected miracle cures.
- You know, put on a little act.
- Clever.
But unnecessary.
They're getting along just fine.
Just as I thought.
The doctor seems to have everything under control.
The doctor's playing dead.
I think he is dead.
- Am I dead?
- Certainly not.
But appearances are deceiving.
Look, maybe you better get your family doctor.
It may not be such a bad idea burning down this hut.
We have faith in you.
Oh, no.
I'm a quack.
I'm a fraud.
I told you he was our kind of people.
As a matter of fact, we'd like to have you look at another patient.
- Another lion?
- No.
A Gila monster?
A man-eating shark?
- One of the family.
- But you were close.
Oh, no, no.
You see, I don't have a license to treat humans.
Oh, you can treat Cousin Itt.
- You wanna watch that low bridge.
- Yes, I have to.
Here's the patient, Doctor.
- What is it?
- Good question.
That's our Cousin Itt.
Tell the doctor what's troubling you, darling.
That's it in a nutshell.
But I didn't understand a word.
He's in your hands, Doctor.
Oh, no, I don't He could - Does he bite?
- Certainly not.
Although he does bark a bit.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather burn the place down?
No, Dr. Mbogo's methods are far too advanced.
We prefer the old-fashioned remedy.
It's the same all over.
That's Cousin Itt.
All heart.
I didn't hear anything.
Oh, dear.
It's worse than I thought.
I'd better take his temperature.
Bull's-eye!
Well, at least we know his appetite's good.
- He loves thermometers.
- Real sweet tooth.
Please.
All you have to do is spread a little kerosene and light a match Nonsense, Doctor, you're doing splendidly.
Cousin Itt looks better already.
At least he's got his color back.
How do you feel, Cousin Itt?
You see, he's a completely new man.
And anything is an improvement.
You're not a doctor, you're a miracle worker.
Can I go now?
Not until you look in on Cleopatra.
Cleopatra?
Does she eat thermometers, too?
No, but she's a glutton for tongue depressors.
Here's your patient, Doctor.
Where?
Cleopatra, say hello to the nice doctor.
It's choking me.
Nonsense, Doctor, that's love at first sight.
You have a wonderful plant-side manner.
Come here, Cleopatra, darling.
Come here, baby.
Yes, there's Mother's baby.
Let the doctor examine you.
Did you ever see a more piqued-Iooking African strangler?
Poor thing.
She's just lost all desire to strangle.
No, she hasn't.
No, she hasn't.
You see?
Oh, dear.
Well, are you going to examine her?
- Of course he will.
- Of course I will, yes.
Well, Doctor, what is it?
The plant needs watering.
Why didn't I think of that?
By george, that's an excellent diagnosis.
Doctor, how can we ever repay you?
By letting me out of here.
Of course.
As soon as you have a look at Uncle Fester.
Uncle Fester.
Hurry, Doctor, before we lose him.
What seems to be the trouble?
I'm sick.
That's a death rattle if I ever heard one.
First thing we have to do is get him on a comfortable bed.
What could possibly be more comfortable than the bed he's on?
Excuse us a moment.
- Maybe he is a quack.
- Oh, no, darling, I think he's just nervous.
Uncle Fester is giving a magnificent performance.
Reminds me of Edwin Booth Addams.
- When he made theatrical history?
- When he died.
Oh, yes.
Well, Doctor, what have you discovered?
My watch stopped.
Uncle Fester does seem to have passed the crisis, though.
No, I haven't.
Of course you have, Fester.
The doctor has remarkable healing power.
Don't tell me, I'm the patient.
It's the end.
Will you excuse us, please?
Darling.
Uncle Fester seems to be overdoing it a bit.
A real ham.
What do we do?
Maybe we ought to let the doctor lose one.
Wouldn't be a bad average.
No, the doctor might have a relapse.
Good thinking.
Well, Doc, the only thing you can do now is operate.
- Never.
- Why not?
Can't stand the sight of blood.
Just a moment, please.
The doctor's slipping faster than Fester.
Yes, we may be witnessing medical history in the making.
The first time a patient ever loses a doctor.
We've gotta make Fester take a turn for the better.
Now.
- How?
- Good question.
I wish I knew the answer.
I have it.
Doctor, I'm afraid you're not the man for this case.
Oh, I'm not.
I'm not.
Uncle Fester doesn't need a doctor.
He needs an undertaker.
Wait a minute.
I'm not dead yet.
You will be by the time he gets here.
The undertaker will be right here.
Wait a minute!
I just had a big comeback.
Yes, a comeback.
Congratulations, Doctor, you've done it again.
- Done what?
- Such modesty.
You've just snatched this man from the jaws of death.
I did?
You're the Albert Schweitzer of veterinarians.
Doctor, how can I ever repay you?
I keep telling you, by letting me get out of here.
I know the whole world is clamoring for your services, and you must answer that call.
Right after you have a look at Thing.
Thing?
Who's Thing?
Not who, Doctor, but what.
Thing, come out.
The doctor's here.
Well, Doctor, he's in Boy, he was in a hurry.
Poor devil.
Didn't even wait for his fee.
Strange, strange man.
Thank you for trying, Thing.
Morticia, Gomez.
- Kitty take a turn for the worse?
- Oh, he's all better.
By george, that doctor is a genius.
Well, Kitty wasn't even sick.
Wasn't sick?
But he didn't eat a morsel of food.
Well, that's because Pugsley had already fed him.
Well, it all was for the best.
- It was?
- Of course.
We helped restore the doctor's confidence.
Love those duets.
Such melodic instruments, darling.
Morticia, Gomez.
- What is it, Mama?
- Now Kitty cat is sick.
Are you sure?
She's sure.
He ate that second meal we put out for him.
It was too much.
Now he's got a stomachache.
Oh, dear.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
- Call Dr. Gunderson.
- Exactly.
Thank you.
Thank you, Thing.
You know, this should be a lesson to all of us.
Gluttony is Hello, is Dr. Gunderson there, please?
Morticia Addams calling.
Thank you very much.
- They say the doctor's gone off to Africa.
- Africa?
Of course.
He went to work with Dr. Mbogo.
Now this, dear.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Lurch.
When you finish there, I wish you'd milk Pugsley's octopus and shampoo Mama's alligator.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
Oh, and when you make up our bed, Mr. Addams' pillow is getting soft again.
I think you better add a dash of cement.
Morticia, that mad music sets my warrior blood on fire.
Oh, Gomez-san, my mongrel chieftain.
That's Mongol.
- That's enough for now, Lurch.
- Yes, Mr. Addams.
I don't want to wear you out.
Lurch?
The bed of nails needs filing.
I want those points needle-sharp.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
When I stretch out on that thing, I want my pores to really open up.
Dear Lurch.
He just loves playing samurai with you.
And he's so graceful at it, like a ballet dancer, isn't he?
Good at concealing pain, too.
You'd never guess he aches all over from that beating I just gave him.
I'm a little worried about Lurch, though, darling.
You think I overdid it this time?
Took too much out of him?
No, but I do think we're overworking the poor dear.
We just work him day and night.
All the rest of the time's his own.
You know, I think Morticia's right, Gomez.
There is an awful lot of work around this house.
That boy ought to have help.
Very well then, he shall have help.
The best that money can buy.
You mean you're gonna hire him an assistant?
Hire?
In this age of automation?
I'm gonna build him one.
Fester?
Meet me in the playroom.
And tell Pugsley to bring his Erector set.
- Right.
- Dr. Addams has work to do.
Darling, you always come up with such practical solutions.
This'll be another Addams first.
I'll have the only custom-built second butler in town.
Yeah.
All the parts you wanted are right here on the operating table.
Thank you, Fester.
I'm working on the mechanical brain, Father.
I'm going to make him talk and everything.
- Good boy.
- And I got all your tools ready.
- Good man.
- Thank you, Gomez.
Well, have another look at the chart.
The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone.
The thigh bone's connected to the hip bone.
The hip bone's connected to the backbone.
Backbone connected to the neck bone.
- And the head bone's up on top.
- Good.
- Wrench.
- Wrench.
- Pliers.
- Pliers.
- Screwdriver.
- Screwdriver.
Delicious.
He sounds absolutely charming, Gomez.
I can hardly wait to meet him.
Where is he?
Just waiting for us to call him, my dear.
Pugsley, you may do the honors.
You rang?
Oh, he is splendid, Gomez.
And what a fine, intelligent face.
We taught him to obey spoken commands.
Yeah.
So anything you want him to do, you just tell him so.
Smiley, go over there and brush the ashes off of Mr. Addams' coat.
Wow.
Isn't he the efficient one?
- He can do everything Lurch can do.
- Maybe even better.
Not better.
Certainly not better, Lurch.
It's just that we know you've been working so hard lately.
Mr. Addams thought you might like some help.
Fester and Pugsley helped me build him for you, Lurch.
This is Smiley, your assistant.
Assistant?
Pull the noose, Lurch.
You rang?
You see?
With Smiley helping, you can take things a little easier, relax a bit.
Not only that.
You'll no longer be a plain butler, Lurch.
Now, you'll be head butler.
Head butler.
- Well?
- Good.
Well, you chaps run off and get acquainted.
Lurch here'll explain the work to you, Smiley.
Follow me.
- Head butler first.
- Yes.
Sir.
Yes, sir.
Better.
Oh, dear Lurch.
He's so pleased with his new helper.
Always was a warm, friendly sort.
- Your turn again.
- Well, what's the score, Gomez?
I believe I'm ahead Hey, it's really close this time.
Darn, another near miss.
I just peeked into the kitchen and saw Smiley washing the dishes for Lurch.
Splendid.
I hope his hands don't rust.
I think this is the beginning of a whole new era around here.
I sure hated the old one.
With Smiley doing the menial tasks, Lurch will be free to do all those special favors we love so.
The things that only Lurch can do.
Nobody does a back scratch like Lurch.
It's those talons of his.
You rang?
My back itches, Lurch.
You know the spot.
You rang?
Scratch.
The next time Gomez wants Smiley to scratch his back, he'd better wear armor.
Smiley is a bit overanxious, but I think Lurch will train him.
There, good as new.
Where's Gomez?
He's playing tug-of-war with Thing.
Those two have fun together, don't they?
Gomez, darling, be careful with him.
Give up, Thing?
I have you now.
Better luck next time, Thing.
Think I'll teach Thing samurai.
Not getting much competition from Lurch.
Morticia, where's Lurch?
I suppose he's teaching Smiley the household chores.
Why?
Is something wrong, dear?
Well, my head needs waxing.
Oh, yes.
It is beginning to get a little scruffy and dull-Iooking.
You're right.
You rang?
Wax job for Uncle Fester's head, Lurch.
You rang?
Wax job, Uncle Fester's head.
Yes, sir.
I wanted Lurch to put it on.
He does it so nice and smooth.
Now, patience, Uncle Fester.
You must give Smiley a chance.
He's gotta learn to work if he's gonna take the load off Lurch.
I don't mind him taking the load off of Lurch, but he's taking the skin off of me.
Busy with your art again, eh, my dear?
Yes.
I'm doing a portrait from one of our old snapshots.
Good old Cousin Crimp.
I'll never forget him.
Or her, either.
They were such fun on a double date, weren't they?
Mighty handy when we needed a third or a fourth for bridge, too.
Well, you go on with your work.
I'm gonna take a little bounce on the trampoline here.
Loosen up my muscles.
I love a man with loose muscles.
Alley-oop!
That nearly loosened my teeth.
You rang?
Would you mind tightening up the trampoline, old man?
Seems to have lost its bounce.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
You rang?
Tighten, more bounce.
Yes, sir.
Very capable, Lurch.
Seems to be learning quickly.
Tightened.
Alley-oop!
Well, as long as I'm upstairs, I think I'll lie down and take a nap.
Oh, I'll have to try that.
It can be tiring walking up those stairs.
There's mother's baby.
It was the worst breakfast I ever ate.
Lurch should be ashamed of himself.
Lurch didn't cook breakfast, Mama, Smiley did.
Lurch was much too tired.
Oh, the mail's in.
Thank you, Mama.
And thank you, Thing.
- Darling.
- Thank you, my dear.
Occupant, occupant, occupant.
Dear, do we know anyone named occupant?
We're always getting mail for those people.
Send it back.
Say, here's interesting news.
Says national fitness week begins today.
How nice.
I think I'll start with one of those invigorating rubdowns Lurch used to give me.
Oh, that would be nice for you, dear.
Relax you and improve your muscle tone.
Yes, I need it.
My muscle tone is terrible.
Yes, it is.
Perhaps Lurch can get you back in tune.
You rang?
A rubdown, Lurch.
Meet you in the playroom.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
You mean he sent Smiley to give you a massage?
I think it was the straw that broke the camel's back.
Better make that my back.
I'm wondering if Smiley wasn't a big mistake.
But he's such a perfect dear.
He's ruining a good butler.
Can't get a lick of work out of Lurch now.
He has the robot doing everything.
Oh, darling, Lurch is just going through a phase.
He'll get over it.
He will, but I won't.
After all, dear, you did build Smiley so that Lurch could take it easy.
Tish!
French!
Speak some more.
Darling.
Lurch now, "ooh-la-la" later.
Later.
- Where were we?
- Lurch.
Oh, yes, Lurch.
You're right.
I've been unreasonable about him.
From now on, I'll insist that he relax and enjoy himself.
Good.
He's such a shy, sensitive soul.
I'm sure if he thought you were displeased, he'd be miserable.
Probably off somewhere now, worrying himself sick.
- You rang?
- Going for a walk.
- Get my good suit.
- Yes, sir.
Darling, why don't you call poor Lurch and reassure him?
Capital idea.
Smiley, shoes.
I've been yanking on this bell for 20 minutes.
Why doesn't Lurch answer?
You want me to go up to his room and see if he's dead or something?
If he's resting we shouldn't disturb him, and if he's dead there's no point to it.
Irrefutable logic, my dear.
- Oh, Lurch, how nice you look.
- You going for a stroll, old man?
My constitutional.
Excellent idea.
You look better already.
Keep it up, Lurch.
Don't worry about a thing, we're getting along fine.
Better than ever.
Than ever?
Back soon.
There's no need to hurry.
Stay out as long as you like.
Have yourself a good dinner downtown and see a nice movie, Dracula and the Wolfman.
Have yourself a few laughs.
Yes, do.
We really don't need you at all.
Don't need me?
- Not a bit.
- That Smiley is terrific.
Now, you run along and have some fun.
Changed mind.
Work.
- Querida.
- Darling.
Oh, my favorite flowers.
Nothing is quite as festive as a vase of chrysanthemums.
The blooms are so large this year.
Superb.
You were born with a green thumb.
Really?
Must have been very attractive.
I'm sorry we couldn't talk Lurch into taking the evening off.
We must insist on it.
Told Smiley to keep these cigars lighted.
- You rang.
- You rang.
A light, Smiley.
I was addressing Smiley, Lurch.
You've been working too hard.
Relax, get some rest.
Smiley'll take care of the work.
Thank you, Smiley.
- Consolidated just hit 175.
- Really?
What did you pay for it, dear?
Two hundred and seventy-five.
It's the best I've done all year.
How exciting.
Darling, would you move my chair over here?
I'd like to watch you.
- You rang.
- You rang.
I rang for Smiley, Lurch.
Smiley, will you move Mrs. Addams' chair over here, please?
Yes, sir.
That will be all, Lurch.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
You're to go upstairs and lie down and take a nap.
Do you understand?
Who'll cook dinner?
Smiley will cook dinner this evening.
Now, you're to take a long rest.
And don't come back until we call for you.
And, Lurch, that's an order.
Bravo, Gomez.
You're a born saboteur.
It was all right.
Darling, you always love a good, crunching wreck.
Is something wrong?
Well, I have a little indigestion.
Smiley's dinner wasn't quite up to snuff.
Yes, he isn't half the cook Lurch is.
That roast aardvark was rather disappointing.
It didn't even look good.
Can you imagine, a roast aardvark without an apple in its mouth?
It's like It's like a martini without the egg.
Oh, darling, please.
I know what you need.
Why don't you have a go at your sword swallowing.
That always settles your stomach.
I give up.
Now, now, darling, you must learn to be a good loser.
I'm winning.
But it's no fun.
Smiley can't cheat like Lurch.
I taught Lurch everything he knows about cheating.
Now, darling, nobody's perfect.
Smiley's doing his best.
Right.
I'm sure we can all put up with a little inconvenience for Lurch's sake.
Is he still resting?
He's been up in that room for three hours now.
Calm, relaxed Finally at peace with himself.
Smiley wants my job.
They like him best.
Pile of tin junk!
It's unfair.
Thank you, Thing.
I'm through.
Finished.
What can I do?
You're a real friend, Thing.
Gung ho, my lord and master.
Samurai time again, darling?
Yes, but it won't be much fun without Lurch.
But he has to get his rest.
I'll teach Smiley.
Smiley!
You rang?
No, Smiley, I called.
I'm gonna make an ancient Japanese warrior out of you, Smiley.
- First thing I want you to do - No!
Follow me.
Isn't that sweet?
I don't think Lurch is jealous of Smiley anymore.
He probably wants to play with him.
Well, this house always has bred peace and harmony.
- What was that noise all about?
- And where's Smiley?
Resigned.
Well, Gomez darling, it's been a long day.
I think I'll go upstairs to bed.
Be right up, my dear.
One more round on the trampoline and it's beddy-bye.
Don't be long, darling.
Oh, Lurch, look at this thing.
It needs tightening again.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
Good thing Smiley's not tightening that for you.
You almost went into orbit after he fixed it.
Well, Smiley was only a robot, Fester.
When something needs a really delicate adjustment, Lurch is the only one I trust with it.
Thank you, Mr. Addams.
- Fixed.
- Thank you, Lurch.
Alley-oop.
Gomez Yes, the trampoline.
Well, darling, as you always say, - this is the age of automation.
- Querida.

Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Lovely!
Wait till you see how it really works.
Will you hand me another log, Fester?
Thank you.
Are you sure it's gonna work?
Well, there's only one way to find out.
- All set, querida?
- Any time you're ready, darling.
All right.
Ready.
Aim.
Fire!
I don't know how we ever got along without a flamethrower.
No housewife should be without one.
Think of the savings in matches alone.
Not to mention the efficiency.
Instant yak!
Toasted.
- Morticia, can I try it once, please?
- Of course, dear.
I'll give you something really to shoot at.
Pardon me.
Okay, light the cigar.
Gomez, dear, aren't you being a little reckless?
Not at all.
It's only a nickel cigar.
Steady, Gomez!
Uncle Fester, you have nerves of steel.
Now, only if his hand would stop shaking.
Don't you worry about me.
All right, Morticia, give me the countdown.
Ready.
Aim.
Fire.
Gadzooks, Fester!
You set the stuffed bear on fire.
Maybe I should have had it on low instead of high.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch, would you bring a bucket of water, please?
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
By george, you have to admire Lurch.
Never panics.
Thank you, Lurch.
Well, I'm afraid we're a bit late.
Dear old Smokey.
Up in smoke.
He was a great burner.
Just after I spent all morning polishing his fur up.
Polishing his Uncle Fester.
Did you use the E-Z Clean?
I thought you said kerosene.
Natural enough mistake.
Yes, and besides we have plenty of insurance coverage for normal household accidents.
Of course.
The insurance company must have thousands of claims from badly-aimed flamethrowers.
Hello.
Double Indemnity Insurance Company?
I'd like to speak to your manager, Mr. Henson, please.
A.J. Henson speaking.
I'd like to report a household accident.
Damage from a burn.
A cigarette burn?
No.
A bear burn.
Was the bear smoking?
Hardly at all, and he went up just like that.
Madam, will you please give me your name?
Morticia Addams.
Digby, come in here this minute.
Did I or did I not tell you to cancel all the Addams' policies?
And I did just that, sir.
Their life insurance, car insurance, hurricane insurance, - endowment to the college - Household accidents?
Household Oh, dear.
That one I forgot.
Wait.
It always opens by itself.
Well, open it.
Let me see.
Come.
Follow me.
Good luck, Digby.
That's 30 for Thing and none for you, dear.
Really, I thought I beat him once.
No, darling.
It was I who beat him.
Mr. Digby.
Double Indemnity.
Good to see you again, Digby.
You remember my wife?
No one forgets Mrs. Addams.
Now, about your claim.
Could I see this bear you burned?
Of course.
There he is, poor dear.
Just a cinder of his former self.
I don't want to quibble, but how do I know that was a bear?
Well, let's use simple logic.
- Does it look like an antelope?
- No.
- A zebra?
- No.
- A giraffe?
- No.
- An elephant?
- No.
A tiger.
- No.
- A camel?
No!
- A gorilla?
- Well No.
No.
Well, then it must be a bear.
Querida, with your incisive mind, you should be on the Supreme Court.
I do love those black robes.
Look, I hate to quibble.
How much money will you settle for?
Digby, don't be vulgar, we don't want money.
What we want is another bear.
What else could possibly go with our decor?
A bear may be a little hard to come by.
- How about a lion?
- We already have one.
Stuffed?
Well, he is after he's had his dinner.
Speak of food and here's Kitty cat.
Excuse me.
Well, that was rather abrupt.
He was in a hurry to settle our claim.
Excellent service.
Darling.
Read some more of Mr. Poe.
He's so exciting.
Certainly makes the blood rush to one's head.
"Once upon a midnight dreary "while I pondered, weak and weary "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore "While I nodded, nearly napping "suddenly there came a tapping "As of someone gently rapping "rapping" - Is that someone rapping?
- I can't tell if it's rapping or tapping.
Querida, do you suppose it could be the raven?
I don't think so, dear.
This rapping seems to be coming on a window.
And according to Mr. Poe, ravens rap at doors.
Maybe this bird's a little confused.
- Darling, it is a raven.
- Looks exactly like Digby.
By george, it is Digby.
Digby, old man.
We're not accustomed to people lurking about our windows.
Is the lion around?
- No, he's asleep.
- We'll wake him if you like.
No.
No, please!
Well, speak up, old man, do you have our bear or haven't you?
Well, yes and no.
I like a man who comes right to the point.
Mr. Addams, we simply can't find a bear that big.
That's absurd, there are thousands of them running all over Alaska.
That's what he said.
"There are thousands of them running all over Alaska".
If we gave people everything they want, we would soon be out of business.
Digby, there are two ends to running the insurance game, taking the money in and refusing to pay it out.
Maybe you'd better talk to him.
We'll go over there together.
Old Loophole Henson will show you how to handle troublemakers.
How sweet of you, Mr. Henson, to take this personal interest in our little problem.
Oh, we believe in the personal touch, dear Mrs. Addams.
No matter how ridiculous the claim may be.
I know just what you mean, Henson.
Would you mind reenacting the accident?
Not at all.
Fester?
Hi.
I didn't know we had company.
These gentlemen are here about our insurance claim, Uncle Fester.
Take your firing position, Fester.
Henson, if you'll just step this way, I'll show you exactly what happened.
Now, I was standing right where you are, the cigar in my mouth, and Mrs. Addams uttered those fatal words.
Ready.
Aim.
Fire.
This is outrageous!
Certainly is.
Fester, you missed that cigar by a good two inches.
Why, there isn't a policy in the world that covers a flamethrower.
Oh, that's not quite true, sir.
As it says right here in paragraph 42, subhead 18, fine print, article 12, "Fire is fire".
Oh, I am glad you mentioned that, Digby.
You're fired!
And so far as your policy is concerned, sir Gomez, I have a feeling he isn't going to pay.
Nonsense.
He's just playing hard to get.
Well, anybody got the want ads handy?
Don't worry, Mr. Digby, we're going to help you.
Now I'm worried.
We're going to take you under our wing.
Have a cigar.
The executive type if I ever saw one.
A perfect hit!
Congratulations, Digby.
You are now in our hands.
Digby?
Digby, I'm talking to you.
Oh, darling, these executive types.
The mere smell of success goes right to their heads.
It's no use.
I can't bring him to.
Uncle Fester, do you think you're charged up enough to do this?
I'll give it a whirl.
Don't, don't.
I'm innocent.
Pull your self together, old man.
Must have been a dream.
I thought I was in the electric chair.
The chair isn't electric.
But Uncle Fester is.
Yeah, I'm really hot today.
- Let me out of here.
- Relax, Digby, you're among friends.
Please.
Call my enemies.
I got to get out of here and find a job.
That won't be necessary, you can go to work in any of my far-flung enterprises.
How far-flung are they?
Oh, Africa.
Asia Minor.
Asia Major.
Haven't you something a little further?
You name it, we've got it.
Before you make your decision, you should see all the opportunities.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch.
Please bring the projector.
We want to show Mr. Digby some opportunities.
Ready, Lurch?
Ready, Mrs. Addams.
Action.
Camera.
There's my mango plantation.
Lovely location.
Right next door to the most charming colony of cannibals.
Cannibals?
Well, they're really nice fellas once you get to know them.
They keep inviting us over for lunch.
As guests?
As dessert.
There's a real opportunity there for a go-getter.
Job of superintendent is wide open.
What happened to the last one?
Dessert?
I don't know for sure.
He was such a sweet man.
Dessert!
Well, if the mango business doesn't appeal to you, here's my crocodile farm in Mozambique.
I've got a real opening there.
I don't think I care for that opening.
Gomez, darling, Mr. Digby's right.
He needs something where he can rise right to the top.
I've got just the thing coming up.
My tapioca mines on the top of Mount Everest.
Now, the transportation is a bit tricky, but once you get up there, it's a veritable fairyland.
How do you get the tapioca down?
You've hit the problem right on the head, Digby.
That's why we need a new manager.
Well, Digby, which one would you like to shoot for?
With opportunities like that, I'll think I'll shoot myself.
Too many opportunities.
Too confusing?
Well, look, you just go home and think about it.
I'll think about it at the unemployment office.
Poor man.
Fifteen minutes of unemployment and he's completely unhinged.
I have it.
I'll set him up in his own business.
- An insurance company?
- Excellent idea, my dear.
I'll capitalize with $500,000 and amortize the principal over a 10-year period.
Darling, what does that mean?
Who knows?
That's the way I run all my enterprises.
Sometimes, simple faith is best.
- You rang?
- Yes, Lurch.
We're going to open the Digby Insurance Company.
We want you to prepare a full-page ad for this afternoon's newspapers.
What shall I say?
Well, use your own judgment, Lurch.
You have a wonderful flair with words.
Let yourself go, be lyrical.
With enthusiasm like that, how can we miss?
Follow me.
Well, Digby.
What do you think?
It's such a proud moment for him, he's speechless.
I can't do this.
Nonsense, old man, it's no trouble to help a friend.
What kind of a setup is this, anyway?
Efficiency.
Everything under one roof.
There's our head of personnel and incoming calls.
Allow me to introduce our chief medical examiner.
There's our actuary and expert on life expectancy.
Really tight-knit organization.
- Any suggestions?
- Just one.
Would you please take my name off the sign outside?
Now, now, Mr. Digby.
You'll never get anywhere being a shrinking violet.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello, Digby Insurance Company.
Morticia Addams speaking.
Well, we'd be happy to insure you.
You've been turned down by 17 other insurance companies?
And you're only 96?
Sheer prejudice.
Have someone wheel you over and we'll give you full coverage.
How is that for bringing in the business?
You'll have every insurance reject in town over here.
Exactly, that's what we're specializing in, the forgotten man.
There's a perfect example, Digby.
Would you believe it?
That strapping young fellow has been rejected by every insurance agency in the country.
How true, Cousin Itt.
And by Canada and South America as well.
And why?
- Maybe he couldn't pass the eye test.
- Nonsense!
He merely wears those glasses so people won't pester him for autographs.
We not only insured him, we made him a member of the staff.
He's in charge of small claims.
Customer.
Mrs. Addams, would you take care of the gentleman, please?
Yes, Mr. Addams.
Yes, sir, may I help you?
I would like to take out some insurance.
Life, fire, theft or earthquake?
Life.
What are your rates?
That depends on what kind of dishes you prefer.
Right!
The higher the prices of the dishes, the lower the premium, or something like that.
If you don't care for dishes, we can arrange to give you a 3% dividend.
Provided you pass the medical exam.
Right this way, sir.
Well, Fester.
What do you think?
I think with that beard, he needs fire insurance.
Sit down, please.
Now, cough.
Again.
Once more.
You have a bad cough.
- Well, what's the prognosis?
- He needs a doctor.
Will the gentleman live?
He has a chance.
Congratulations, sir, you've just passed the medical.
Now, if you'll just step this way, we'll see about your life expectancy.
Crystal ball, crystal ball, what do you say?
Will he live for 20 years or only a day?
Well, Mama.
What do you see?
I see an imposter.
Mr. Henson, what are you doing here?
That's perfectly obvious, Digby.
He's here to spy on our advanced business methods.
Just for that, Mr. Henson, no dishes.
Well, you can keep your dishes and you can keep your policy.
I was a little worried about the competition.
But this?
This is absurd.
I've got the goods on this whole operation.
And as for you, Digby, I'll have you in jail for 40 years.
Don't worry, Digby.
I am also an attorney.
We'll fight this to the bitter end.
You are a very lucky man, Mr. Digby.
My husband hasn't lost a case in ten years.
Or was that ten days?
I'll have to check my records.
Well, don't bother.
Because you are not going to be the attorney in this case, you are going to be the defendant.
I'll have you and your whole family in jail.
We'd better make a run for it.
Nonsense, Uncle Fester.
This is sheer intimidation.
The Better Business Bureau will hear about this.
It certainly will.
Henson, just a moment.
In that case, I'm afraid I'm gonna be forced to cancel my industrial insurance with your company.
What industrial insurance?
Mangoes Incorporated.
Tapioca Limited.
Crocodiles Unlimited.
Darling, you forgot Amalgamated Swamp and your buzzard farm.
You control all those companies?
Give or take a few.
Wait a minute, if you pull all that business away from me, I'll be ruined.
We could give you a job with Digby Insurance.
After all, this whole thing is just a little bit of a misunderstanding.
I mean, surely there must be something I could do to make up to you.
Well, that depends on Digby here.
All I want is my old job back.
And all we want is a decent replacement for our lovely bear.
It's a deal.
Well, Digby, you're rehired.
Oh, thank you, what's my first assignment?
Alaska!
We're going to get these wonderful people the biggest bear we can bag.
Isn't it marvelous, darling, how people cooperate once they understand the problem?
You have to hand it to Henson.
He really came through with a beautiful bear.
Yes.
It's too bad about his little accident.
Well, you have to watch out for those avalanches in bear country.
Still, he is lucky.
He's in the best hospital in Anchorage.
Gomez, would you come here a second?
Would you help me fix this flamethrower?
What's the problem?
Oh, I don't know.
It's stuck.
Okay, you try pushing down the trigger and I'll look down the barrel and try to see what's wrong.
It's stuck, all right.
Oh, silly me.
I forgot to release it.
The safety catch.
Operator, would you get me the Seaside Hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, please?
Hello, Seaside Hospital?
May I speak with Mr. Henson?
Well, can't you take him out of traction long enough to answer the phone?
Mr. Henson?
This is Morticia Addams.
I hate to bother you at a time like this, but I have to report another little accident.
Mr. Henson?
Mr. Henson?
Oh, dear.
I am afraid he's had another relapse.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Uncle Fester, I don't think Mama will like you playing with her crystal ball.
Well, while she's cooking I thought I'd see if I could read it.
Find anything interesting yet, Fester?
I'm trying to read Morticia's future.
What do you see, Uncle Fester?
Incredible monster with beady, little eyes and a forehead like a gorilla.
You're looking at your own reflection, Fester.
I thought he looked familiar.
Wait a minute.
I'm beginning to read something.
Morticia, it says that your school chum, Trivia, is coming here to visit.
I told you that yesterday, dear.
Oh, yeah, I could have sworn I saw it in the crystal ball.
Wait a minute.
Somebody's trying to send us a message.
I see some words.
There are some words, but they're rather fuzzy.
Maybe it's Trivia trying to get through.
- Now I can read it.
- What does it say?
It says, "Made in Japan".
Miss Trivia.
- Oh, Trivia.
- Darling.
Trivia, you certainly look well for you.
Nice of you to say so.
We thought you were getting married.
Oh, I was on the verge, but I just couldn't go through with it.
- Why not?
- He never asked me.
- Besides, my heart's in showbiz.
- Showbiz?
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day yeah Beautiful.
How's showbiz treating you, Trivia?
They love me in Altoona.
One reviewer compared my scene to the mating call of a platypus.
- No wonder they're becoming extinct.
- Uncle Fester.
- Allow me.
- Why, thank you, Lurch, darling.
- What's the matter with Lurch?
- He is acting rather peculiarly.
I bet he had some of Mama's salamander puffs.
He just can't eat rich deserts.
Well, as we show folks say, I think I'll take five and go freshen up a bit.
Traveling, it's such a tiring bore.
Of course, dear.
Lurch, take Miss Trivia's things up to her room, please.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
Lurch, no!
I said, Miss Trivia's things, not Miss Trivia.
Sorry, lost my head.
I'll have to apologize for Lurch.
I don't understand what came over him.
I can.
He's in love.
Lurch in love?
Impossible.
Well, who can he be in love with around here?
Poor boys There just seems to be something about me they simply can't resist.
I wonder what it could be.
How do you feel about Lurch?
Well, he's rather cute, but I have no time for love.
Showbiz is my entire life.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky Oh boy I'm lucky - With a voice like that she should get life.
- This calls for some nerve settling.
Poor Lurch, love at first sight.
- Maybe, he should take a second look.
- They would make a handsome couple.
Oh, well, c'est la vie.
Tish, you spoke French.
Gomez, darling, please, there is a time and place for everything.
- How about here and now?
- Dear, I'm worried about Lurch.
- Who's Lurch?
- Our butler.
Oh, Lurch.
Yes.
I think we should find out how serious he is about Trivia.
Good idea.
Maybe it's just temporary insanity.
- You rang?
- Yes, Lurch.
I Well, that is, we, couldn't help but notice how taken you were with Miss Trivia.
Oh!
Come, come now, Lurch, your feelings are written all over your face.
Just look at him.
By george, Morticia, you're right.
If I ever saw a love-sick expression.
- He's sick all right.
- Oh, it's so romantic.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky Here she comes again, Lurch.
Now, just walk right up to her and tell her how you feel.
No.
Well, nothing to it, old man.
Well, we'll be in the conservatory watching.
After all, two is company.
And with Trivia, it could be a crowd.
- Well, where is everybody?
- Watching.
- He sure thinks fast on his feet.
- Watching?
Who?
Oh, well, it doesn't matter.
I've got to get on with my rehearsing.
Showbiz, you know.
Miss Trivia Yes, Lurch, you wanted to say something?
Speak up, speak up.
I've got no time for idle chatter.
Nice day.
That's not much of a proposal, but it's a good weather report.
Is that all you wanted to tell me?
Well, what else?
Come, come.
I have got to get on with my career.
You and Oh, I know.
You want my autograph, right?
No?
Oh, of course, you're trying to tell me you're smitten with me.
Naturally, but my heart's still in showbiz.
Well, better luck next time.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day Oh, dear This is going to be terrible for poor Lurch's ego.
Not to mention his personality, either.
- Yeah, he's such a fun kid.
- Bit on the shy side, though.
- A bit.
- I have an idea.
If we can only change Trivia's mind about Lurch.
How can we?
You heard her, all she cares about is showbiz.
But if we could convince her that Lurch is even more exciting She might give it all up for him.
That's a capital idea, querida.
Oh, but we can never do that.
We'd have to make a whole new man out of him.
I'll just fire a volley of the old Addams spirit into him.
Wednesday and I could work on his social graces.
They have been sadly neglected.
Yeah, and after a couple of hours with me, why, he'll know all there is to know about women.
- What do you know about women, Fester?
- Well, I had a mother, didn't I?
Take it from an old Latin lover, Lurch.
Nothing brings out the woman in the woman more than the man in the man.
Trivia sees you in a gaucho outfit, she'll be a goner.
I hope so.
Well, look what it did for Valentino.
When she sees you've mastered the bola, that will really knock her for a loop.
Now, watch.
Watch carefully.
Style The form Now, the crucial thing about the bola is knowing exactly when to let go.
A split second too soon or a split second too late Let that be a lesson to you.
Oh, Gomez, darling, did you help Lurch?
I tried to teach him the mastery of the South American bola.
- You're an expert at that.
- Yes, but I'm afraid he's a slow learner.
- Not all men have your talents, darling.
- Or yours.
Oh, by george, Morticia.
You have outdone yourself.
What is it?
Well, I was going to call it Mishmosh at Dawn, - but I'm afraid that's a bit pretentious.
- Well, you may be right.
I think I'll call it just plain, simple Blob.
It's perfect.
Well, I think I'll have another go at Lurch.
Perhaps modern dance this time.
Oh, darling, Wednesday's teaching him that.
Oh, capital.
Blob, however did you think of it?
Well, actually I heard someone describing my last painting that way.
And it inspired me.
- Querida.
- Darling.
This is the latest.
It's called the Droop.
- Come on, now you try it.
- Me?
- I think Miss Trivia's a swinger.
- Swinger?
You don't want her to think you're square, do you?
Then if you learn how to dance well, she'll think you're boss.
"Boss"?
Neat Groovy Come on.
Try it.
Loosen up a little, let yourself go.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day You got it, Lurch!
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.
I thought the mazurka went out ages ago.
Wednesday, darling, you're excused.
- Please turn off the phonograph.
- Yes, Mother.
Lurch, the music has stopped.
I know, but I can't.
Now, here we are, darling.
Now, Cleopatra, Mother knows best, dear.
You simply must get on a low-calorie diet.
Open up Cleopatra, your tentacles are getting thick.
Open up!
- Querida.
- Good morning, darling.
Oh, my!
You look a bit under.
Glad to hear it, because that's the way I feel.
Couldn't get a wink of sleep with Lurch moaning all the night.
Oh, yes.
I heard him, too.
Moaning and walking the floor.
Sounded like a herd of elephants.
Where is he?
I haven't seen him this morning.
He's probably with Uncle Fester finishing his course in the feminine mystique.
Good.
If I know Fester, he'll pull no punches.
He's a man's man.
And now, Lurch, my boy, you and I are going to have a man-to-man talk.
Now, the first thing is we I seem to be a man short.
Lurch!
Now, if you wanna make any headway with Trivia, you've gotta understand all about women.
And that's my department.
Now, the most important thing is the proper approach.
Now, I'll be Trivia.
Oh boy I'm lucky They say I'm lucky This is my lucky day Well, pick it up.
Keep going.
No No!
That's not what you're supposed to do.
You're supposed to take it and say, "Pardon me, you dropped your handkerchief.
"How about a date tonight, baby"?
You got it?
Okay, now try it again.
Oh boy I'm lucky This is my lucky Poise, Lurch, poise.
Dropped handkerchief.
How about a - What's the matter, Lurch?
- You're not my type.
I'm going to end it all.
Oh, good!
Now, we're getting someplace.
Well, how are things in the school of romance?
School just let out.
Lurch is going to end it all.
That's ridiculous.
You can't do away with yourself just like that.
- That's right.
You gotta leave a note.
- Exactly.
Spoken like a man, Lurch.
We have to find just the right note.
Something that will make Trivia come to her senses.
Yeah, make her realize what a good catch she could have had.
Be a real happy ending.
Make a note, Thing.
- How about, "Dear Trivia"?
- No, it sounds a little flat.
You know, a note like this should start off with a real grabber for Trivia to find in Lurch's outstretched hand.
Good thinking, Fester.
How about, "Farewell beloved"?
No suspense.
You give away the whole ending.
Fester, you're a born showman.
How's this, "To Whom It May Concern"?
Bingo!
Changed my mind.
Changed your mind?
Lurch, there no sense just hanging around being miserable, is there?
No, maybe, we could figure out some glamorous way for him to go like - Jumping off the roof.
- Too messy.
Lurch, how do you feel about gas?
- Gives me heartburn.
- Yeah, me too.
Forget about it.
This is a happy little group!
Is Lurch's problem solved?
Beautifully, he's gonna end it all.
Very romantic, but isn't that a bit extreme?
Did Romeo and Juliet think it was a bit extreme?
Certainly not.
And they lived happily ever after.
- Or did they?
- No, Uncle Fester, they did not.
Besides, where would we find a replacement for dear Lurch.
Querida, your wisdom is exceeded only by your great beauty.
French!
And bubele, too.
Gomez, not now, not now.
We gotta solve Lurch's problem first.
Oh, yes, Lurch's problem.
Lurch, I think you should sweep Miss Trivia off her feet.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
- Thank you, Thing.
- No, Lurch.
Forget about the sweeping.
Miss Trivia is very musical-minded.
Why don't you appeal to that side of her nature?
- Serenade her?
- Exactly.
Ah, that's our Lurch, willing to try anything.
- Tish, our song.
- Hits you right here.
Lurch, you try it.
I think we better forget about the serenading.
We'll just have to leave it up to Mama.
- Mama?
- Yes, she's going to work on dear Trivia.
Well, if anyone can do it, it's Mama.
She's a real femme fatale.
I spoke French.
Bye!
Is it true you're really going to help Lurch's romance, Grandmother?
Well, you can't leave these things to amateurs.
What are you going to do?
I'm going about it scientifically.
A love potion.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky Oh, Trivia!
Is someone calling me?
Come and get your yak juice.
- Yak juice?
- Nice and scalding.
Oh, good, it does wonders for my complexion.
- Where's that man?
- Coming up.
You rang?
Lurch, you great big, wonderful hunk of masculinity.
Well, I guess you two love birds wanna be alone.
Where, oh, where have you been all my life?
The kitchen.
Nothing like a leisurely stroll on the freeway.
I'm yours, Lurch.
My heart, my soul, my bank account.
It looks like my coaching paid off.
Lurch really hit pay dirt.
Looks more like an avalanche.
Tell me you love me, Lurch.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
Oh, say it again.
Oh, please.
Bashful, eh?
I'll unbashful you.
- Changed mind.
- Come back!
Come back, Lurch!
Ah, dear Trivia.
She's finally come to her senses.
I guess old Lurch just broke down her resistance.
He does have an irresistible charm.
Reminds me of Casanova Addams.
When he toyed with women's hearts?
When he was jailed for nonpayment of alimony.
- Let me in, Lurch.
- No.
Ah, Trivia.
Gomez!
You great big, lovable brute.
- Is there some mistake?
- Certainly not!
You're a man, aren't you?
You're drunk with love, you don't know what you're doing.
I may be drunk with love, but I know what I'm doing.
Oh, Gomez!
Gosh, it sure is quiet around here.
Quiet and full of love.
Love?
Lurch and Trivia have finally found each other.
Well, I could see where he'd have a little trouble finding her.
They've fallen in love.
I can't see where she'd have any trouble - Love?
- Madly.
Well, it may not be an ideal marriage, - but it'll certainly make an ideal divorce.
- Oh, no, Uncle Fester.
Trivia's a one-man woman.
- Gomez, darling, what's wrong?
- Trivia, she's in love with me.
You better make that a two-man woman.
Gomez, that's impossible.
You're a married man.
I think that sort of slipped Trivia's mind.
I tried to get away, but she was like a tigress.
Oh, dear.
I can't believe it.
My best friend, a husband-stealer.
She could get in trouble doing that.
That's petty larceny.
Fester, you've gotta calm her down.
You have to explain to her what it would do to Lurch if he found out she was hopelessly in love with me.
Better explain what it would do to me, too.
Don't worry, I'll straighten it out.
Darling, isn't it a comfort to have a person like Uncle Fester to take things in hand.
You beautiful, delicious man!
I'm mad for you!
This is destiny.
Haven't you got me mixed up with Gomez, or is it Lurch?
All I know is I'm mad, mad, mad for you.
- You know something, I think you're fickle.
- Only as far as men are concerned.
Trivia!
I thought you were in love with Gomez.
And I thought you were in love with Lurch.
Oh, those were just silly, little infatuations.
This is the man I really love.
But I'm a confirmed bachelor.
- Since when?
- Since - Just now!
- I just love it when they play hard to get.
Itt!
You marvelous mountain of hair.
Oh, you know just what to say to a woman.
Gomez, this thing with Trivia has gone far enough.
You're absolutely right.
Jilting me for Fester.
Uncle Fester does have an inner magnetism.
Yes, he does have that certain je ne sais quoi.
Tish, that's French, I wish you'd said that.
- Trivia now, darling, je ne sais quoi later.
- You said it.
Later, darling.
Later.
Later.
You're the only man I've ever loved.
You have a girl?
Excuses!
Excuses!
This is destiny.
Fate!
Tell me you love me.
Tell me, tell me, tell me.
Say it again.
Either that's Cousin Itt or Uncle Fester needs a shave.
You delicious man.
Cousin Itt, I'm so glad I found you.
Trivia, what's the meaning of this?
You can't do this to Lurch and Fester and - Well, you can forget about me.
- Oh, I have.
I have.
I found my one, my true What's the matter with him?
Why are you staring at me that way?
Oh!
Something happened here.
What?
- Well, we thought you were in love.
- Love!
Me?
Oh, silly.
Well, I've got to be going.
Showbiz is calling.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky I'll help her pack.
This is my lucky day - Lurch seems eager to get rid of her.
- I guess he's fickle, too.
In that case, it's too bad.
They would have made a perfect match.
Poor Lurch.
We failed him.
And when I think of how beautiful it could have all been.
If only he had taken that final step.
- Into matrimony?
- Off the roof.
Well, we all make mistakes.
I still can't understand what went wrong.
This stuff always worked before.
Well, I'm sort of glad.
- Now Lurch won't leave.
- That's true.
I think I'll go feed my spiders.
Oh boy I'm lucky I'll say I'm lucky This is my lucky day - What is it, Mama?
- Age, my boy.
Just age.

I thought it would be nice for Uncle Fester.
This is fun.
Makes me all goose-bumpy.
It's always so exciting seeing how these games turn out.
Just about another foot to go, old man.
Zounds.
- The electricity's gone off.
- Sure!
I knew something would spoil it.
Now, now, Uncle Fester, it only missed you by a hair.
No matter, I'll get another fuse.
No, forget it.
I'm out of the mood now.
I'll be up in my tree house.
Gomez, darling, wasn't that the doorbell?
I believe it was.
That means the electricity is okay.
It must have been Uncle Fester who blew a fuse.
I'll have Pugsley bring him a fresh one.
Miss Ophelia.
Ophelia, what a surprise.
Oh, dear brother-in-law, you behold the most miserable of women.
Well, you are that.
But what happened?
Throckmorton didn't like that.
He jilted me.
Montrose didn't like it.
Throckmorton didn't like it.
Bunch of spoilsports.
Well, look on the bright side, Ophelia.
Just because you've been jilted once or twice, it doesn't mean you are unattractive.
You're very attractive, and strong as an ox.
- Hi, Aunt Ophelia.
- Oh, Pugsley, this is a tragic day.
What happened?
Throckmorton didn't like that.
Now, Pugsley, you can see why your Aunt Ophelia's heart is broken.
Her heart and my back.
Ophelia, I thought I heard you.
Oh, Uncle Fester, you behold a most wretched woman.
Say, you do look better.
Ophelia's been jilted.
- Again?
- Practically left at the altar.
What happened?
Throckmorton didn't like being judoed.
You sure do have a weakness for weirdoes.
Nobody loves me for myself.
Well, that's understandable.
Have you tried offering money?
But, Father, isn't that undignified?
Very, and besides, it doesn't work.
Oh, cheer up, Aunt Ophelia, you'll make a very nice old maid.
Ophelia, maybe you're a bit too anxious.
Men like their women mysterious, elusive.
That's my type.
I'm afraid I should go upstairs and rest.
I just have no more strength.
You see, he only went six feet.
There's no hope for me.
Did I hear my sister Ophelia?
- Who else leaves me black and blue?
- Oh, mon cher.
- That's French.
- Darling, please, Ophelia first.
I'm next.
Well, I think I'll go work on Ophelia's problem.
Oh, poor Ophelia.
She seems destined not to find love.
Perhaps we could find something to divert her.
Some sort of career, perhaps.
Maybe she could go to Japan and take up sumo wrestling.
She tried that.
That's how she lost Horatio.
I have it, science.
The world needs another Madame Curie.
Excellent!
We'll give her a few of Pugsley's chemicals, and she can mix, mix, mix until she discovers something.
- But what?
- I don't know.
Perhaps she could mix herself another man.
I think I'm beginning to get something.
You know, this reminds me of Sir Newton Addams.
When he made his scientific discoveries?
No, when he set his house on fire.
Oh, yes, that was the high point of his career.
- Well, shall we begin?
- Right.
- Powder.
- Powder.
- Water.
- Water.
- Hydrochloric acid.
- Hydrochloric acid.
- Tincture of benzoin.
- Tincture of benzoin.
- Salicylic acid.
- Salicylic acid.
Uncle Fester, you keep giving me the same test tube all the time.
Yeah, I know, I mixed them all together.
It saves test tubes.
Very shrewd.
- Now then, the black bottle.
- The black bottle.
- The white bottle.
- The white bottle.
- The blue bottle.
- The blue bottle.
- The green bottle.
- The green bottle.
- No, you don't.
- Why not?
That's my after-shave lotion.
- Uncle Fester, that's sulfuric acid.
- Yeah, I know, it's real tangy.
There's something about a sulfuric acid man.
There's nothing like a quiet afternoon of culture.
Darling, perhaps Ophelia should devote herself to art.
You may be right.
Science doesn't seem to be it.
Here it is 3:00.
Ophelia's been up there mixing chemicals for two hours and nothing.
Well, we must be patient with these new scientists.
After all, dear, she hasn't the faintest idea of what she is doing.
See, I think she stumbled onto something.
- Sounds like something big.
- I'll go see what it is.
Congratulations, Ophelia.
What happened?
I discovered that if I mixed the blue stuff with the green stuff Well, science is definitely out.
But don't worry, we'll think of something.
There's no hope for me.
'Tis the last rose of summer That is blooming all alone That is exquisite, unbelievable.
It's this room.
This room of art and beauty.
Ophelia, we've found your career.
You could be an opera singer.
Me, an opera singer?
- Well, you'll have to put on a little weight.
- Oh, I will, I will.
Yes, your voice will need a little polishing and I know just the right little polish.
- Cousin Itt.
- Exactly, I'll go find him.
Oh, Cousin Itt.
- Morticia, I have wonderful news.
- What is it, dear?
Ophelia is on a threshold of a new career.
I know, she told me all about it.
Isn't it exciting?
Certainly is.
Cousin Itt!
Itt, now you come down here this minute.
Playful and sneaky, too.
My dear, would you mind giving it a try?
Cousin Itt, it's an emergency.
No, Cousin Itt, the house isn't on fire.
But we do have another emergency.
Ophelia wants to learn how to sing.
Wait.
We need you.
Gomez, darling, are you sure Cousin Itt is our man?
He spent 15 years at the West African Institute for Music.
- Teaching?
- Supplying hair for violin bows.
Oh, well, in that case, Cousin Itt, what do you think sister Ophelia's chances are?
Certainly, you have an opinion?
With lots of hard work.
And serious intense study.
That's your considered opinion?
Well, at least there's hope.
And a true artist lives on hope, as long as he has a strong constitution.
We'll start immediately.
I'll have Lurch accompany Ophelia.
Oh, dear, this one's out of order.
No problem.
You rang?
Lurch, how would you like to be Ophelia's accompanist?
Dear Lurch, he's such an enthusiast.
Cousin Itt, take over.
Darling, I think we should leave the music lovers alone.
Lurch will get Ophelia.
Let's go to the playroom and read.
I've got a better idea.
Let's go to the playroom and play.
- Hang onto these.
- Thank you, darling.
Now, it's really quite simple.
When Fester blows the whistle, play starts.
The first player to get the puck to the opposite wall scores.
Oh, but darling, isn't this supposed to be played on the ice?
- That's too slippery.
- Very sensible.
- All right, you two.
Are you ready?
- Ready.
Gomez, darling, I do believe he's trying to tell us something.
Come now, Fester, speak up.
Oh, now, Fester, you can speak more clearly than that.
Oh, my, Ophelia upstairs studying opera, and now this.
We're getting to be quite a musical family.
Either that or he swallowed his whistle.
Uncle Fester, I've warned you about those between-meal snacks.
Querida, how many calories in a whistle?
Well, are you ready?
Now, back to the game.
Gomez, darling, don't you think we should check on Ophelia?
Cousin Itt must have her singing like a bird now.
- A canary?
- A vulture.
Dreamer!
We couldn't stand the suspense any longer.
How goes it with our little songbird?
Dear Cousin Itt, he's taught me everything he knows.
Even more?
Generous to a fault.
Well, fire away.
By george, he has taught her everything he knows.
Down to the last But, Cousin Itt, in opera, don't they sing in Italian?
That was Italian?
Really temperamental, those long hairs.
Oh, dear, just as my career was blossoming, it's nipped in the bud.
Not yet, Ophelia dear, we'll get you another teacher.
I know just the man, Ophelia.
Signor Bellini.
Darling, are you sure he's available for house calls?
Querida, Signor Bellini is an artist.
And artists are always ready to sacrifice for art, if the price is right.
Let's see how much money we have on hand.
You rang?
Now that's what I call functional art.
We're out of petty cash, Lurch.
In the barrel, please.
Thank you, Lurch.
More in ice-box.
Good thinking.
There's nothing like cold cash.
Stop.
Stop, stop!
Is something wrong, Signor Bellini?
No, except that in my 20 years of coaching the greats, near greats and even ingrates, I have never heard such squawking, squeaking and screeching from a human throat.
I have a feeling Signor Bellini isn't too impressed.
Nonsense.
These maestros only abuse the students they love.
Shall we try it again, maestro?
Who cares?
I've already got ulcers.
Is that better, signor?
Would you like me to show you just how much better?
Yes, Signor Bellini, yes.
Temper.
You're right.
I could have broken a perfectly good cane.
He's really a taskmaster.
He's trying to bring Ophelia out.
If he ever hits her, they'll have to carry her out.
Signorina Frump, I can't take anymore today.
Tomorrow I come back for another fee Lesson.
- Just practice.
- Which part shall I practice?
Sing them all.
All at once, for all I care.
Oh, you mean like this?
Could you do that again?
Or didn't I hear what I heard?
Oh, joy to the world, I have charmed my maestro with my simple triple-stop, double-vibrato vocal harmonium.
A musical miracle.
It's amazing.
Beneath all that mediocrity she has hidden talent.
Perhaps we can bring it out.
If she is willing to work, and you're willing to pay.
We'll pay anything.
What does she have to do?
First, she must empty her mind of everything.
That should be no problem.
- She must sing day and night.
- Day and night?
- Night and day.
- Oh, that one she knows.
Starting with scales, she must work five hours a day.
If she cuts out meals and sleep, she can work 25 hours a day.
Gomez, darling, aren't there only 24 hours in a day?
By george, you're right.
She'll just have to sing faster.
In three months I'll have her ready to audition.
Better make it six.
Morticia, that's French.
- Gomez, darling, we have a guest.
- Oh, pardon me.
You rang?
Lurch, would you please show Mr. Bellini the door.
But I'm not ready to go.
All right, I'm ready.
I want you also to work on her tremolo.
Oh, we will, we will.
I'll put her on a strict diet.
Darling, what an exciting six months it's been.
And in a few moments, our Ophelia will be auditioning for the great impresario Rudolpho himself.
That reminds me, Uncle Fester, how's Ophelia's throat spray coming?
I think it needs a little splash of ammonia.
The color is getting good.
It is sort of a bilious fuchsia.
- There, I think it's done.
- Well, we'll know in a moment.
- It's perfect.
- Well, got to get it while it's hot.
There you are.
Singer's Squirt No.
5.
Thank you, Uncle Fester.
When we spray Ophelia's throat with this, she'll sing like she never sang before.
That must be Signor Bellini and the great Rudolpho.
Quick, Uncle Fester, go upstairs and spray Ophelia.
Signor Bellini and impresario Rudolpho.
Oh, charming, we've heard so much about you.
Yes, I've heard quite a bit about you, too.
And until today I didn't believe it.
Let's get on with the audition.
What a voice you're going to hear.
Just one moment, Bellini.
Impresario, Gomez Addams here.
Now before we bring on the little lady, there are few details of contract to be settled.
First, she's to have star billing.
Star billing?
But I haven't even heard her yet.
Exactly, we can't take any chances.
- We want to see Ophelia's name in lights.
- In lights?
Uncle Fester will supply the electricity.
He can make it flicker.
Now, as to money, salary, we're prepared to start modestly.
$10,000 a week plus 90% of the gross.
And, of course, free tickets for every member of the family at all performances.
Get the girl and let her sing.
In due time, Bellini.
Just one more detail to settle.
Impresario, we don't want Ophelia doing any of those tired, old operas by Wagner, Puccini, Verdi.
You see, we feel that a new singer should have a new opera.
Exactly, and with this in mind, my dear Morticia has composed one.
It's a frothy little item entitled Afternoon In A Swamp.
Bellini, if ever I get out of here alive, you won't be.
Thing, may I please have the contracts?
Thank you.
Now, if you'll just sign the contract.
Signor Gomez, I will not sign anything.
Very well, a handshake is good enough.
Please, humor him.
Shake hands.
Here comes my dear sister, Ophelia.
Gentlemen, please be seated.
Play, Signor Lurch.
This is unbelievable.
What have you done to her?
Isn't he the modest one?
It's all Signor Bellini's doing.
All we did was spray her throat with Uncle Fester's special atomizer.
You fools!
You have melted the nodes on her vocal chord.
Bellini, you are barred from my opera house.
Even with a ticket.
Impresario Rudolpho, you haven't heard my wife's opera.
For that I am grateful.
The prejudice against new music.
At least you could hear the finale.
It's truly inspiring.
As the dancers glide through the quicksand, the chorus swells triumphantly.
And the prima donna sings that lovely aria, Afternoon In A Swamp.
Left him speechless.
I knew it would get him.
Hello.
Ophelia Frump?
Just a minute, I'll see if she That's me.
Throckmorton, lover, angel, where are you?
In hiding.
Yes, of course.
Bye, bye lover.
I'm sorry.
I cannot join the opera.
You can't?
Oh, my dear young lady, this has been a red-letter day for music.
And as for An Afternoon In A Swamp, this has certainly been one.
I'm sorry, Signor Bellini, but a woman must place love before her career.
Forget it.
I'm just going to take a long walk, against the traffic lights.
What's all this about love and career?
Throckmorton wants me back.
He says he's sure now that we can be completely compatible.
Oh, what happened?
- He took up judo.
- Judo?
This.
- How're we doing?
- Perfect score, dear.
You've missed 100 out of 100.
The mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Gomez, darling, it's from the Canary Islands.
Strange, we don't know any canaries.
- Oh, it's from my sister Ophelia.
- I wonder what she says.
Oh, she says it was all off between her and Throckmorton - from the very first moment they met.
- From the very first moment they met?
He dislocated his shoulder.
But she says she's happy.
She's regained her two-part voice and it's lovelier than ever.
- She even sent us a record.
- Well, let's give it a listen.
Oh, I'm falling in love By george, she's done it again.
I must write to her immediately.
I have a lovely idea for her next record.
What, cara mia?
The Sextet from Lucia.
