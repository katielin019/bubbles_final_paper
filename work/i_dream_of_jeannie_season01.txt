{START OF EPISODE 01}
-Thank you, Tony.
-Good morning.
-Good morning.
-Good Morning.
-How are you feeling, Tony?
-Kind of eager, sir.
He's a lucky devil.
Wouldn't want to sit this one out, would you?
No, thanks.
lt's my baby.
-Everything checks out, general.
-Good.
Melissa asked me to give you her love.
She wanted to come and see you off but l don't break regulations, not even for my daughter.
-No, sir.
l understand.
-Tony, this is your week.
Up in orbit today and marrying Melissa on Sunday.
We'll throw you a bachelor party when you get back.
All systems A-okay.
Ten seconds to firing.
Nine, eight seven, six, five four, three, two one, zero.
Lift-off.
Status, Control-- -What happened?
-Final stage misfired.
He won't be able to maintain orbit.
Control to Stardust One.
Control to Stardust One.
Come in, Tony.
Stardust One to Control.
Final-stage rocket misfired.
We'll have to bring you back.
Stand by.
This is General Stone.
We have an emergency.
Stardust One is coming down.
Alert the Seventh Fleet.
l must have gone further into orbit than l thought.
Well, l've read about genies, but l never thought they really-- lt's like something out of the Arabian Nights.
l suppose if l didn't come along, you'd still be in this.
Wait a minute.
l rescued you.
l rescued-- That means l get a free wish or something.
Genies do that, don't they?
Well, of course they do.
Yeah, genie-- l'll tell you what l wish.
l wish there was a big, beautiful P2V right up in the sky, over my head right now.
l have to get a genie that doesn't speak English.
Airplane, airplane.
Airplane, you know.
lt's up in the sky.
Up there, see.
-Simore.
-Yes, yes, yes.
All right, simore.
No, no.
No, no, no.
No, no.
Genie, take it away.
Yeah.
Yeah, that was a simore, all right.
All right, look, forget about the airplane.
l wish for a ship, genie.
A boat.
A boat in the water, in the ocean.
Like this.
A ship.
-Heshti.
-Yes, yes.
Heshti.
You're older than you look.
No.
No, it's-- lt's not right, genie.
lt's not right.
Take it away.
Genie, l wish you could speak English.
Somehow l must find a way to please thee, master.
Forget it.
You'll never be able to please me as long as you don't understa-- You spoke English.
That's all l had to do was say, '' l wish.
'' Thou may ask anything of thy slave, master.
That's very kind of you.
l-- l actually don't need anything at the moment.
Yes, l do.
l need a helicopter.
-Helicopter?
-Yes, a helicopter.
lt's a-- Well, it's like an airplane, and it's big, and it's noisy.
Well, it has blades on top.
Makes that kind of a noise.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's a helicopter.
That's a helicop-- That's a helicopter!
That is a helicopter!
Genie, you're marvellous.
l don't know how to thank you.
-l will teach thee, master.
-Wait a minute, genie.
But l-- l gotta get my gear.
Come on, let's go.
Oh, boy.
Wait till l get you back to the base.
-l'll travel anywhere with thee, master.
-Sure.
Sure.
Wait till General Stone sees you.
Genie, l'll never be able to explain you.
Well, l-- l'm setting you free.
Thou hast set me free, master.
Now l belong to thee.
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
l rescued you, and you rescued me.
We're even.
l'm going home now, and you-- You go wherever you go.
Okay?
Goodbye, genie.
Goodbye.
-Are you a welcome sight.
-Well, so are you.
The world is wondering where you are right now.
-l was wondering myself.
Where am l?
-Well, l'm not quite sure.
Storm blew us off course.
-Well, how did you find me?
-lnstinct, captain.
lnstinct.
Come on, let's go get your gear.
Yeah, l can't wait to get out of here.
-What, did you lose something?
-No.
No, no, it's all right.
You say something?
-Did you say anything?
-No.
Come on, let's go.
l'm always fascinated by these local courtship customs.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Melissa, excuse us while your fiancÃ© and l have a chat?
l'll wait for you outside.
-l'll drive you home?
-Wonderful.
Doctor.
Well, l just checked over your report.
You don't seem to suffer any physical after-effects.
No, sir.
-No emotional after-effects?
-Not exactly.
-But something.
-Well, it was-- lt was nothing, really.
l-- l sort of had a hallucination.
-Did you?
-Yes, yes.
l'd been floating around up there, and l suppose l was dizzy and that, in combination with a lack of oxygen and worry and wishful thinking.
Well, she seemed very real to me at the time.
Of course, l know now that it was just my subconscious.
l knew l was off the beaten track, and that l might never be found, and-- When l saw that bottle on the beach, l-- l hallucinated a genie out of it.
-A genie?
-Yes.
A girl genie.
-A girl genie?
-Yes.
-What was this genie like?
-Oh, she was-- Just your average, everyday, run-of-the-mill genie.
Of course.
-Beautiful?
-Yes.
Desirable?
-And helpful?
-Yes, yes.
Captain, that's the classic fantasy.
A beautiful girl on a desert island.
A girl who would do anything for you.
Do you know who that girl was?
No, sir.
l've never seen her before in my life.
-She was your mother.
-My mother's in Salt Lake City, sir.
l'm a psychiatrist.
l know a mother when l see one.
Now, l suggest you go home and get some rest, a lot of it.
Well, thank you.
l feel a lot better getting this off my chest.
For a while there, l was afraid l was cracking up.
-Were you?
-Yes.
Goodbye.
Get me General Stone.
Darling, how would you like me to fix dinner for you?
That would be wonderful.
Well, that's the least l can do for the conquering hero.
Yeah, some hero.
l didn't even finish the mission.
Well, that really wasn't your fault.
Tony?
-ls there someone in your shower?
-No.
Of course not.
Who would be taking a shower--?
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye?
l didn't realize how tired l was.
Well, you look a little tired.
All right, darling.
Of course l understand.
l tell you what.
After l get a little rest l'll pick you up, and we'll go to dinner-- Well.
Well, look-- Look who's here.
l'm looking.
-Melissa, this is-- This is Jeannie.
-Tony.
l've always prided myself on being tolerant, but.
But would you explain to me, what is that girl doing here?
Well, that's the explanation.
She's not here.
-What?
-Well, she is here but, of course, she's not a girl.
-No-- -Goodbye, Tony.
-No, no.
You don't understand.
-Oh, l'm afraid l do understand.
Tony, l may be tolerant, but-- But that's a girl.
lt's a girl.
What was that one doing here, master?
That one was my fiancÃ©e.
-Thou art kidding.
-Now, just a minute, young lady.
-Melissa happens to be a very-- -A black-haired demon.
Well, yeah, look who's talking.
l can do much more for thee than she can.
Now, stop that, Jeannie.
We don't do that in America.
l mean, when you're engaged to General Stone's daughter you don't do that in America.
Yes?
Hello.
Oh, hi, Eddie.
General Stone's on his way over here?
Right.
Right, thanks.
General Stone's on his way-- General Stone's on his way.
You've gotta get out of here right now.
-l'm happy here with thee.
-Oh, but you-- Jeannie, l hate to do this, but l wish you to vanish.
-Where did l go wrong?
-Thou hast set me free.
That means that l am free to please thee.
And l am going to please thee very much.
Oh, no.
No, please-- Look, you don't understand.
Please, General Stone's gonna be here any minute.
l'll tell you-- Get back in your bottle, okay?
-Back in your bottle, huh?
-Oh, thou art so masterful.
Now, Jeannie-- Now, Jeannie, l mean it.
Stop that.
l mean it.
Would you please cut that out?
l don't think you understand how really important this is.
This-- l want you to get back in there.
Now, come on, stop playing around.
Please-- Jeannie, look.
Yeah, look.
Jeannie, look.
Look at what l have.
lsn't that pretty?
Look, look, look.
See?
-lt's a black pearl.
-Yes, yes.
lt's yours.
lt's yours.
Here.
There.
l got you.
Stop.
Bless you.
l'm gonna let you go now, Jeannie, and l-- Thanks for everything.
Have a nice trip.
-Hello, Tony.
-How you doing, boy?
-How are you feeling?
-Great.
Just great.
Dr. Bellows told us about your hallucination.
Well, you didn't have to mention that, sir.
lt was nothing really.
lt was just the heat of the excitement.
lt was nothing at all.
l explained it all to him.
Sometimes these hallucinations return, captain.
ln all conscience, l can't qualify you for active duty again until we're certain that you're completely normal.
l am normal.
Absolutely normal.
There's no girl in a bottle.
Dr. Bellows and l both think-- Excuse me.
Hey, stop!
Hey, wait a minute, there's a girl in there.
She must have sneaked past us.
Jeannie?
Are you all right?
Now, come on, speak to me.
What's with this guy, Charlie?
l told you, there's a girl in there.
She's in a bottle.
Well, no wonder we didn't see her.
You're sick.
Hey, stop!
Please, no!
You could kill her.
-l'll buy the garbage from you.
-What?
l'll buy the whole truckload.
-What do you charge for garbage?
-We're in a high-class neighbourhood.
l mean, we got a good grade of garbage.
l'll give you $1 0.
Here.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, speak to me.
Please!
Jeannie?
Jeann-- -Oh, here she is.
Here she is.
-Come along with us, captain.
We'll buy you all the garbage you want.
lt's all right.
No, no, no.
Jeannie, you can come out now.
She saved my life, you know.
Come on out, Jeannie, the general's waiting.
Oh, look, look, look.
Look, look.
See?
See?
Now, come on.
Yeah, now l see her.
She's really quite -smooth.
She's beautiful.
-Very clear.
You and this girl were inside of this bottle, playing marbles.
-Call the hospital.
-Please-- No, wait.
Sir-- Please.
You really believed me, didn't you, huh?
l really had you fooled.
Oh, if you could see the expression on your faces.
What do you mean, you had us fooled?
When l was putting you on.
Do you remember the time you locked me in the freezing chamber and left me there, huh?
And do you remember the time you blew me out of the wind tunnel?
Well, l was just getting back at them, sir.
You mean the whole thing is just a gag?
And what a gag.
l really had you guys going, huh?
You made it seem remarkably real.
Very interesting.
Well, l hope l didn't carry this too far, general.
You really had me worried, Tony.
l wouldn't want a son-in-law who went around seeing genies, would l?
-Well, of course not, sir.
-Rest.
l'll see you in the morning.
-Yes, sir.
-Let's go.
Come on, you guys.
l really had you going.
We thought we'd lost you.
Well, you'll know better than to play practical jokes on me in the future.
Oh, l'm terribly sorry.
Thou deceived me.
l should turn thee into a serpent with two heads.
Now, don't do anything you're gonna feel sorry for.
l trusted thee.
What manner of master art thou?
l appreciate everything you've done for me.
Honestly, l do.
But-- Well, there's just no room for you in my life.
l wish you'd take my shirt off, Jeannie.
No, no!
l mean, l wish you'd put on your own clothes.
Thanks.
You're just not Air Force, Jeannie.
l have a career.
l have a fiancÃ©e.
That one, she's made of ice.
She could never make thee happy.
For over 2000 years l've been in that bottle.
And then.
Then this hand released me.
Oh, when l saw thy wise face l cannot tell thee how much happiness thou hast brought to me.
No, no, no.
No.
Thou must relax.
Wait, wait.
Now, stop.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, put me down.
Jeannie, stop.
Now, is this not better?
Well.
Well.
lt beats going into orbit.
How'd you get in that crazy bottle anyway?
A wicked and powerful jinn put me in there because l would not marry him.
You poor kid.
lt must have been wild in those days.
Oh, it was.
lt would please thee to see it.
Hey, this is wild.
Ladies-- No, no, no.
Please stop.
We don't do this in Cocoa Beach.
Hey, look, Jeannie, l-- Jeannie, would you please--?
Could you--?
Lady, would you take this--?
Would you stop this.
-Art thou not pleased, master?
-Yes-- No!
Now, look, they're liable to lock me up now.
Thou art the most stubborn and ungrateful master l've ever served.
Hey, Jeannie.
That's-- That's very kind of you.
You can go.
Disappear now.
Jeannie, don't leave me here.
Don't leave them here.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Look, l want us to part friends.
l'll tell you what, let's-- Let's go get your bottle and take it down to the beach or somewhere where you won't be seen, and you can take off.
l'm sorry if l hurt your feelings.
So that's what's been going on since l've been out of town!
l never saw him before.
But he's got a bottle waiting for you at his place.
-You rotten home wrecker!
-No, no, no.
l-- Sir, l wasn't talking to your wife.
l was talking to your smoke.
l thought it was a friend of mine.
Thank you.
Hello, Tony.
We were having a little barbecue, sir.
-Are you going to a costume ball?
-No-- Well, l thought l might.
Shall we go inside.
Why don't we stay out here, sir.
lt's so cool.
Tony, let's go inside.
-You won't like it in there.
-Well, why not?
-For one thing, l'm redecorating.
-How come you didn't tell me?
Wait!
Wait, l can explain everything.
lt's very simple-- You all make yourselves comfortable.
That's much better.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Tony, there are certain things that are expected of Melissa's husband.
Yes, sir, l know.
-Find that amusing?
-No.
No.
-That's not funny.
-What did you say?
Nothing.
Nothing.
You seem very nervous, Tony.
No, sir, l'm fine.
Fine.
Just fine.
l'm gonna recommend a vacation for you.
That's an excellent idea, sir.
Somewhere a long, long way away from here.
That's a wonderful idea.
-l believe in long honeymoons.
-So do l. So do l. l know that you've been under a terrible strain, darling.
And l'm-- l'm willing to make allowances up to a point.
But-- You don't want me to make allowances?
Oh, l do.
l do.
Get out of that dress.
-What?
-l didn't mean you, Melissa.
Tony, when you were up there you didn't meet any unidentified flying objects, did you?
Tony's just tired.
After all, he has been through a lot.
You'll never know, Melissa.
l think you're going to feel so much better once we get married.
-Would you get out of here.
-What?
Not you.
Not you, sir.
lt's all right, darling.
l think it's time that you should go to bed.
-l think you're absolutely right.
-l'll come by in the morning?
lt might be a better idea if l came by to see you.
Naturally, l don't want to find that girl around here anymore.
-Naturally.
-Good night, Tony.
Good night, Dad-- General.
l'm going to see that everything is just fine, darling.
Just fine.
Fine.
Fine.
Good night.
Good night.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh, laugh, laugh.
You're laughing, l'm dying.
Well, go ahead, a good laugh.
l'm glad you're enjoying yourself, because the party's over.
Now, listen here, young lady.
l am a grown man.
l won't have someone taking over my life like this.
Do you understand that?
l won't-- Jeannie, what are you doing to me?
l'm sorry, Jeannie.
You have got to go.
l want you to get on your magic carpet, or however you travel and when l got up in the morning l don't want to see you here.
Do you understand that?
Oh, no, you don't!
Jeannie.
Jeannie, stop that.
Out.
Out!
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.
The missile went up, but something went wrong and they had to bring it down.
Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle.
At least, it looked like a bottle.
But it didn't act like a bottle because in it was a genie.
Oh, not your average everyday genie but a beautiful genie who could grant any wish.
Captain Nelson was so grateful, he set Jeannie free.
Only she didn't want to be free.
You know how it is when you've been cooped up in a bottle for 2000 years.
She wanted to have fun and she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there in this house, the girl in the bottle plays spin the astronaut.
Why must thou work on such a lovely day?
Couldest thou not play hooky?
We're testing some new oxygen equipment.
Somebody's gotta be there to breathe.
A pity.
The sky reminds me of a bright summer day in Baghdad.
Does it?
Say, has the weather changed much in the last 2000 years?
Oh, weather is weather.
ln ancient Persia, we had an old saying: '' Everyone talks about the weather, but no one does anything about it.
'' You're kidding?
l jest you not, master.
Well, Roger's gonna pick me up.
l better meet him at the door.
lt wouldn't do to have him see you, would it?
Stay and play.
Do not go breathe.
You know, what l'd really like to do on a day like this is go swimming.
l wish l had a swimming pool in my patio.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, what will the neighbours think?
l can't afford a swimming pool.
-You do not wish it?
-No, l do not wish it.
Now, come on, get rid of it.
Help!
Tony?
Where are you, Tony?
-Tony?
-Jeannie!
-Hi.
-The name's Roger.
What are you doing down there, Tony?
Get me out of here.
Thanks.
What am l gonna tell him?
You will not have to tell him anything, master.
He will remember nothing of this.
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course he will.
What are you standing there for?
We're gonna be late.
Yeah, yeah.
You're right.
Listen, l-- l've got a lot to do around here.
l'll meet you there, okay?
-lf l'm late, you start without me.
-Start without you?
Yeah.
Boy, one of these days she's gonna.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
l'm sorry about that, master.
That's all right, Jeannie.
lt could happen to anyone.
Well, almost anyone.
Say, where did we get the groceries?
Oh, l went shopping early this morning.
-You left the house?
-Yes.
l had to hurry down to my neighbourhood grocer to shop for your supper.
Well, now who told you to do that?
A man on television.
Figures.
Master?
Do you think it is proper for a man to strike a woman?
No, of course not.
Why?
Did somebody hit you?
Yes, master.
Where?
At the market?
Yes, master.
Would you recognize him if you saw him again?
l shall never forget his face.
-Come on, let's go.
-Where?
Down to the market.
Maybe we can still catch him.
Please, do not bother.
You have to go breathe.
l do not have to breathe.
lt would be better if you did not get involved in this, master.
lnvolved?
l'm already involved.
Nobody is gonna hit you or any other woman while l'm around.
-You take me to him.
-Now?
Well, of course now.
-Hey, where are we?
-We're at the marketplace, master.
And there's Ali, the man who hit me.
Wait a second.
Wait.
That was 2000 years ago.
Yes.
Why were you crying about it this morning?
-l just remembered it.
-Come on, let's get out of here.
You were insincere when you said you wouldn't let a man strike me.
Well, l was sincere at the time, but that was 2000 years ago.
l mean, come on, let bygones be bygones.
l'd love to avenge the wrong done to you, Jeannie, but-- lf l miss my test, l'll have to explain to Dr. Bellows.
And if l have to explain he'll have me thrown out of the space program-- Let's get out of here.
lt is you.
So thou hast returned.
No, no.
Actually, we were just passing through.
We wanted to take a look at some of your carpets.
Come.
l have been waiting for thee.
-You're hurting me!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Let her alonesir.
lntroduce me to your ludicrously costumed friend.
This is Nelson, flier through the moons of space.
This is Ali, killer of many giant men.
-Killer of many giant men, huh?
-Do not fear.
You are far too puny and small for Ali to bother with.
Come.
Hey, wait a minute, you.
-l told you to put her down.
-Let go of me.
Put me down.
Here, stand back.
Stand back.
All right, fella, l warned you.
Ali deals with giants but l'm gonna make an exception in thy case -and break thy neck.
-Oh, l don't think so.
l'm gonna have to teach you a lesson, big fella.
All right, Jeannie, get him.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Look out!
Look, look.
Look at this fine specimen, a slave among slaves.
What am l offered?
-Five shekels.
-Seven.
l have seven.
l have seven.
-Who will give me eight?
-Eight.
Sold to Muphesta Kem for seven shekels.
-Excuse me.
-Wait, wait, wait.
One was omitted.
What is thy name?
Nelson.
l'm a tourist.
l'm just travelling through.
A traveller.
A man of culture who can tutor thy children.
What am l bid for this fine specimen?
You don't understand, sir.
l can't stay.
l'm on my way to a very important experiment.
Excuse me.
Mark that fighting spirit.
This one you can harness to the plough and spare the oxen.
He will work at home or toil on the fields.
-How much do l hear?
-One shekel is all he is worth.
One shekel?
l'm a college graduate.
l'm worth at least-- Let me out of here.
Did l not tell thee he was high-spirited?
-Three shekels.
-Three shekels?
He is worth 20 times that many.
Look.
Look at these teeth.
l have a lot of cavities.
l use the wrong toothpaste.
l appreciate your interest in me, sir, but l am late for the office.
Excuse me.
-Five shekels.
-Do l hear six shekel?
Does he have any special talents?
-Dost thou have any special talents?
-No, not really.
Well, l'm a jet pilot.
He is a jet-- -What is a jet pilot?
-Forget it.
Do l hear six shekels?
Yes, yes.
l'll bid six shekels.
You'll have my check in the morning.
-When the banks open, you-- -Silence.
Sold to Mr. Bey for five shekels.
Now, wait-- What-- Come on, knock it off.
l happen to be Captain Anthony Nelson-- Stop!
Now, come on, l mean it.
Captain Anthony Nelson of the United States Air Force on detached service to NASA.
Now, come on, l mean it.
Now, you and your friends are gonna get in a lot of trouble pushing around a United States citizen.
lt could mean war.
-War?
-Yeah, war.
With the United States of America.
What is this United States of America?
What are you trying to do, starve us?
Hey, this looks good.
Say, that is good.
What is it?
Goats' eyes.
lt's a special treat.
Today is my birthday.
Yeah?
How old are you?
Eighteen.
Well, how long have you been here?
Eighteen years.
-What's your name?
-Turhan.
Now, look, Turhan, is there any way out of this place?
Oh, yes.
We all go out the same way.
Well, l'm not going out that way, l can assure you.
Do not do anything foolish, stranger.
They have an expert here whose only task is thinking of new ways to cause exquisite pain.
Well, don't worry about me.
l've studied commando tactics.
You.
Captain Anthony Nelson, United States Air Force serial number 3607 6A.
And that's all the information l'm required to give.
-ls there a Red Cross here?
-Come.
Majestic One will see you.
lt's about time l got to see somebody in authority.
l'll put in a good word for you too, Turhan.
Halt.
What's--?
So thou art the new slave.
They told me you were not right in the head.
-lt be true.
-lt is not so.
l'm perfectly normal.
They tell me you come from a far-off country.
Yeah.
Only they don't know how far off.
And how did you get here?
-l can't tell you.
-Why not?
You'd think l wasn't right in the head.
Peel me a grape.
Don't be silly.
Hey, watch the shirt.
You really know how to hurt a fella.
l'm-- l'm sorry about all this.
l really don't even belong here.
l don't even have a visa.
You're looking for a crack in the mouth.
l do not stand for insolence in my slaves.
Now, wait a minute, lady.
Let's get something straight.
l am not your slave.
l happen to be an officer in my government's air force.
-Air force?
-Look, let's not go into that right now.
Look, all l want to do is get out of here.
l lost a friend of mine.
l simply want to go and search for her.
Well, that's your trouble.
You're preoccupied with women.
Well, l have someone who can take care of that.
l have been searching everywhere for thee, son of a jackal.
He needs to be tamed.
See to it.
With great pleasure, Princess Fatima.
l wouldn't do anything l'm gonna be sorry for, pal.
-On your feet.
-Now-- Listen, if there's anything l can't stand it's a bully who hits women, son of a pig.
And there's more where that came from, chum.
l ask thy permission.
Let me break him in half with my bare hands.
You have my permission.
l don't think you're gonna break anybody in half with your bare hands.
Okay, Jeannie, get him.
Luncheon, Your Highness.
Now, come on, Jeannie!
Stop fooling around.
l mean, this is you, isn't it?
l came as quickly as l could to tell you the news.
Oh, Mama.
l can hardly wait for you to meet your new son-in-law.
Oh, my dear.
What does he do for a living, my daughter?
He flies through space, Papa.
-From this he makes a living?
-He is most clever.
-When will the wedding take place?
-At once.
l wish you could have seen him attack Ali and risk his life for me.
Our ancient proposal custom.
You shall be married here in your house.
l'll make the wedding arrangements now.
l shall go and tell him, Papa.
He'll be so thrilled.
Think about it.
lt's almost ready.
l'm sorry l was detained, master.
-Jeannie, where have you been?
-l've been preparing for my wedding.
Your wedding?
Oh, sure, you're back home now and you wanna settle down, get married.
-Are you not pleased?
-Oh, sure.
lt's the best news l've ever heard in my life.
And you'll make someone a wonderful wife.
l shall try very hard.
-lt's a big day for you, isn't it?
-For both of us.
Yeah, for both of you.
lt will be a beautiful wedding.
Well, l wish l could see it.
Well.
-Say.
-Good.
Come.
This is Nelson, flier through the moons of space.
This is my mother.
Well, how do you do, ma'am?
Pleasure.
And this is my father.
How do you do, sir?
Will you excuse us?
l think we should go attend to our other guests.
All right.
That's quite a wonderful girl you have there, sir.
lt is sad.
We were such a happy family before the tragedy overtook us.
Tragedy?
When our daughter refused to marry the wicked Jinn -and he turned her into a genie.
-Yes, that.
Well, every family has its little problems.
Will the wedding be soon, sir?
l'd like to see it, but l have to get back to Cocoa Beach.
What is this Cocoa Beach?
lt's a little town east of Baghdad.
-l wish you will be very happy.
-Thanks.
-May Allah bless you.
-Well, thank you very much, ma'am.
l must say, your guests are certainly friendly.
lt is our custom to wish the groom good luck.
The groom, huh?
The groom, huh?
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie-- Pardon me.
-Pardon me.
-Excuse us.
l want to have a little word with you.
What has happened to upset thee, master?
Well, there's been some kind of ridiculous mistake.
Everybody here seems to think l'm the groom.
What is the mistake?
You don't think we're getting married, do you?
Of course.
You proposed marriage to me.
l did no such thing.
Did you not attack Ali and risk your life to avenge me?
Well, yes, but-- Well, in Baghdad, that is a proposal of marriage.
Now you tell me.
l'm afraid you'll have to call off the wedding or find yourself another groom, or-- Yeah, that's it.
You must have known some wonderful chaps in the old days.
l do not want another groom.
l want you.
Jeannie, l can't marry you.
You hate me.
You think l am ugly.
Of course l don't.
-Then you will change your mind?
-No.
No, l won't, and that's final.
So be it.
Nothing personal, l think you're beautiful.
Oh, do you?
That won't help you.
The iron is ready.
Let's start with your tongue.
For a man who's about to die, you speak with a loud mouth.
What are you talking about?
Your hourglass is running out.
What do you think they'll do to you when they find that Turhan has escaped?
Turhan's escaped?
That's impossible.
Turhan is in his cell.
Well, l'm glad you think so.
l will find out.
And if this is a trick to gain time when l return to you, my pleasure will be doubled.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, now come on.
Get me out of here, please.
-Do your arms trouble thee?
-No.
No, sir.
l was just-- l was just stretching.
l would have a word with thee, my son.
And l would have a word with thee, sir.
There's something we ought to get straight right now.
Yes, of course, the dowry.
The dowry?
Well, that's it.
There's just not going to be-- Yesterday a man was beheaded because he failed to provide sufficient dowry.
May Allah have mercy on his miserable soul.
-Beheaded?
-Tell me, my son how many camels dost thou have?
-Why-- Why, none.
l-- -None?
Well, l mean, l have none with me.
My daughter tells me that thou art a prince among princes.
Well, you know how Jeannie exaggerates.
l would wager that thou hast a king's ransom in goats and oxen.
Yeah, well, l can honestly say l have as many goats and oxen as anyone in Cocoa Beach.
l'm pleased to hear that.
Would you excuse me, sir?
l want to go and see the bride.
Jeannie.
Excuse me.
May l have a word with you, please?
Listen, when l get you home-- We are home, master, unless you would prefer a palace.
Do you know what you're doing to me?
Ali is waiting for me with a hot iron your father is ready to have me beheaded and l'm about to miss an important conference in Cocoa Beach.
That is more important than our wedding?
l told you, there isn't going to be any wedding.
So thou tried to trick me.
Turhan was in his cell.
Well, you can't win them all.
Before l make thee sorry thou wert born -tell me where the girl is.
-What girl?
The blond.
You were with her in the marketplace.
You'll never get your hands on her.
Then thou shalt die in agony.
Hey, come on, cut it out.
Jeannie.
What is happening?
What art thou doing to me?
Now you can go and pick on somebody your own size.
Thou were willing to die for me.
Thou art the bravest man l have ever known.
Can we go back to Cocoa Beach now?
You may go back to Cocoa Beach.
l will never forget thee.
Jeannie, l wish l could explain how l feel about you.
l think you're a wonderful girl, but it just-- Well, it just wouldn't work out.
l'm home.
l'm home.
l'm home!
Jeannie!
Hey, Jeannie, thanks.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, where are you?
Jeannie, are you in here?
Jeannie?
This is goodbye, isn't it?
lsn't it?
Well, Jeannie, wherever you are, l want to thank you for everything.
You've been the greatest thing that ever happened to me.
And if it means anything to you, l'll never forget you.
That means a lot to me, Tony.
Who does your shirts?
Roger, what are you doing here?
What am l doing here?
What are you doing here?
You were to be at the lab two hours ago.
-We tried to call you for the last hour.
-l'm sorry.
Come on, let's go.
Where you going?
The test is over.
l'd better phone the old man and apologize.
-Tony, are you feeling okay?
-l'm fine.
l'm just fine, sure.
Know what's the matter with you?
You're in a rut.
You need excitement in your life.
Listen, remember that Miss Universe that was here last year?
Well, she's back, and she's got a friend.
-How about that?
-No, no, no.
Count me out.
l won't take no for an answer.
This Miss Galaxy is a beauty.
How about 8:00 right here, huh?
-And do you have another shirt?
-Yeah.
Wear it, okay?
Miss Galaxy is a fat show-off.
-They should call her Miss Full Moon.
-l thought you'd gone!
l changed my mind.
l could never leave you.
Did you really mean it when you said l was the greatest thing that ever happened to you?
l refuse to answer on the grounds l may incriminate myself.
l'm sorry l made you lose face at the wedding.
You should see Father, he's still looking for you.
l'll bet he is.
l tell you what, we'll send him a herd of camels.
Jeannie.
Now, come on, l'm leaving now.
Will you stop sulking?
l'm just gonna go to dinner and then maybe take in a movie or something.
And besides, l'm doing this for Roger.
You don't think l'm interested in Miss Galaxy, do you?
There they are.
Yeah, l'm gonna be home early.
All right?
-You'll like him.
-Well, l'm ready.
Very funny.
Very--
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.
The missile went up but something went wrong, and they had to bring it down.
Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle.
At least, it looked like a bottle.
But it didn't act like a bottle.
Because in it was a genie.
Oh, not your average, everyday genie but a beautiful genie who could grant any wish.
Captain Nelson was so grateful, he set Jeannie free only she didn't want to be free.
You know how it is when you've been cooped up in a bottle for 2000 years.
She wanted to have fun.
And she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there in this house, the girl in the bottle plays spin the astronaut.
Where is that razor?
A razor just doesn't simply get up and walk away by itself.
Can't go to a briefing without a shave.
Well, now, who put that in there?
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, you come out of there right now.
Good morning, master darling.
How may l serve you?
First of all, you can stop calling me ''master darling.
'' And secondly, you can stop being such a neatener.
What means this word '' neatener''?
Well, it's like when you throw out my newspaper before l've read it.
And-- And you put her in the drawer.
And now, my razor is missing.
Oh, that.
l got rid of it.
-Why?
-ln the land from which l came it is the fashion for all masters to wear beards.
Well, Jeannie, in this country the only people who wear beards are folksingers and beatniks.
But my handsome master would look like a king with a warrior's beard.
Behold!
Beautiful.
Now you look a proper master.
lf l walk around Cape Kennedy like this they'll blast me off without a capsule.
That must be Dr. Bellows.
Now get me out of this, quick.
Well.
Well, thanks.
Oh, thanks for the shave.
Not very funny.
No, it's not very funny.
But then how many doorbells are?
Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Well, l'm ready, sir.
Shall we go?
We don't wanna be late for the briefing.
No, we don't, do we?
Have a nice day.
Lights, please.
That's it, gentlemen.
We've looked at so many films of the moon's surface when we finally land it'll seem like homecoming.
That's why this survival mission you're embarking on tomorrow is of such vital importance.
When you get back, we'll have a better idea of man's ability to survive a week under really rugged conditions.
Furnace Canyon, Nevada 1 20 degrees during the day, and 1 0 below zero at night.
Miles and miles of nothing but miles and miles of nothing.
Furnace Canyon is hazardous and miserable.
And too easy for our purposes.
Therefore, tomorrow morning at 0600 hours you will be deposited on the floor of Skull Flats, Utah.
Skull Flats.
l'm not complaining, but for once l'd like to go on a survival mission to a place called, like, Happy Valley or Merry Meadows.
Yes.
-Bellows.
-Theoretically men of your age and superlative physical condition should be able to cover the 7 5 miles from the drop zone to our evacuation strip if nothing goes wrong.
-You figure something will?
-Lots of things.
That's the survival game for you.
We're setting you down with one quart of water per man.
Period.
You mean.
You mean no food?
Only what you are able to catch, kill or scrape off the underside of rocks.
Well, the chocolate rocks are mine.
But it is utterly ridiculous.
You cannot go out into the desert without me.
Oh, yes, l can.
This is a do-it-yourself survival mission.
l am leaving you right here.
Just to make certain you don't interfere, back in the bottle you go.
Oh, please, master.
Over 2000 years l've spent in that accursed bottle.
Then one more week can't make that much difference.
Now be a good genie and back in the bottle.
You are the most difficult master l have ever served!
Thanks, Jeannie.
And when l told Annabelle we're going out of town for a week you should hear the way she cried.
Like a baby.
When l told Louise -she completely-- -All right.
lf we hurry we'll have time to say goodbye to Margie and Dottie and Fay -on the way to the airstrip.
-They can wait.
Let me grab this.
Okay, thanks.
Now, Jeannie, l want you to be a good girl, you understand?
Look, look.
Here.
You can play with your marbles while l'm gone.
l hope-- l hope l didn't hit you.
There.
You'll be safe right here.
But how safe am l gonna be on a desert with a guy who talks to bottles?
-Well, is it everything l promised?
-Yes, sir, and more.
Boy, it must be 1 1 0 in the shade out here.
lf there was any shade.
Well, cheer up.
lt's only 7:00 in the morning.
l know l don't have to remind you of the importance -of what you're about to do.
-No, sir.
We appreciate you choosing us for this mission.
Don't we, Roge?
Right.
After this, the moon mission will seem like a weekend in Miami.
-Any final orders, sir?
-No.
Just stay alive and cover as much ground as possible.
Let's get cracking.
l'm anxious to try these synthetic boots.
See how they work.
You go ahead.
l'm gonna stick with the old-fashioned kind.
Boy, this survival business is pretty thirsty work, huh?
l'll drink to that.
Well, here's to you.
Oh, no.
-Oh, no, what?
-Oh, no, l don't think l'll drink yet.
-Try and test the old endurance, huh?
-Yeah, yeah.
Something like that.
Listen, why don't we split up for a while, huh?
l'll.
l'll meet you on the other side of that butte.
Okay, here we go.
See you.
You come out of there.
Now, now, come on.
l'm in no mood to play games.
Jeannie, look.
Don't be afraid.
l just wanna talk to you.
Talking to your canteen.
Aren't you afraid your bottle'll get jealous?
No, l wasn't talking to it.
l was-- Well, you know-- Would you like me to play ''Sugar Blues'' on my comb -or shall we get on with the mission?
-Yeah, you're right.
-See you on the other side of the butte.
-l'll see you.
All right now, Jeannie.
Now you come out of there!
O, cleverest master in all the world teach me the meaning of this strange incantation: Every drop is gone.
Do you realize what you've done?
Well, l'll die without water.
By this time tomorrow, l'll look like a bag of raisins.
Humans just can't live without-- Hey, you're the most wonderful genie l've ever seen in my life.
What am l being grateful for?
lf it hadn't been for you in the first place All right, that-- That's enough.
That's all l'll ask.
lt's a vodka martini.
ls that not my master's favourite potion?
Yes, at cocktail time, but this is life or death.
Just one quart plain, please.
Plain water.
Oh, that's better.
l mean under the circumstances, that's better.
lf you are pleased, l am content.
Now, what do we do?
Well, l get on with my mission, and you get out of here.
-Oh, but you need me.
-No, no, l don't.
Now-- Now listen.
Can't you get it through your head l don't need you.
Look, l'm specially trained for this kind of work.
l-- l don't need your help.
l'm-- Really, l-- l-- Jeannie.
Let me go.
Tony, l'm looking at a mirage you wouldn't believe.
Tony.
Tony.
Hello, Ton.
Ton?
Tony?
Where am l?
Where am l?
-What's that?
-Baktu malali.
An ancient Persian remedy.
Oh, boy.
What is it?
Hot chicken soup.
lt's great.
Great.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Take that away.
l'm not allowed to eat.
-You have had enough?
-Enough what?
Well, this is my master's third bowl full.
Oh, you didn't.
l didn't.
You did?
l did?
Oh, boy.
l've displeased you?
Oh, Jeannie, you meant well but you've just ruined the whole mission.
No.
No, no, not the whole mission.
There's always Roger.
Yeah, good old Roger.
Roger.
Roger, are you there?
Over.
-Roger, come in.
-Hello, Tony?
Where you been?
l've been trying to raise you.
l'm headed for the wildest mirage you ever saw.
Mirage?
Mirage?
What kind of a mirage?
There's this oasis, see?
One of those silk Arab tents and a while back, I saw the wildest blonde.
Well, boy, l sure wish l had your imagination.
No-- No fooling.
I can even smell the incense.
l'll get back to you later when l get a better look.
Maybe she's got a friend for you.
Out.
No, no, no, Roger.
Now don't do that.
Roger, there is no girl.
She's all in your mind.
Roger!
Roger?
Now look what you've done.
He's on his way over here.
lf my master wishes, l can turn that one into a pillar of salt.
No.
No, no, please.
Just get rid of all this.
lt is done.
No, no.
Not quite.
You too.
-But-- -And take your chicken soup with you.
You may kill me, but you'll have a fight on your hands.
Need any help?
What's the matter with your ankle?
l just twisted it a little.
lt'll be all right.
See?
You take it easy and l'll see what l can scrape up for breakfast.
Okay.
l'll try to make a snare for that rabbit.
lf you're gonna wrestle that thing again take it easy.
lf my master's hungry, l could spread a six-course-- Of course l'm hungry.
But you know the rules.
What'd you say?
l said l was hungry.
Tony.
Tony, what are you doing?
You're not gonna believe this but l got so hungry l took a bite out of my walkie-talkie.
God!
Hang on, will you?
l got some cactus here that looks beautiful.
l'll try to get the needles off and bring you some, okay?
lf the meat is not pleasing to you, l could?
No.
This is wonderful, but l can't gorge myself on roast lamb while my buddy is out eating needles.
l ran into a special down at the supermarket.
Look what dad's got for breakfast.
Looks delicious.
Hey, you know something, l must be cracking up.
l could swear l smell roast lamb.
Oh, that.
Yeah, well l got so hungry, l cooked my shoe and l ate it.
-Roast shoe?
How did it taste?
-A lot like roast lamb.
Oh, boy.
No matter how hungry l get l can never eat these fibreglass goodies.
Listen, Roge.
With this bum ankle, l'll never be able to keep up with you.
You better.
You better go out on your own.
And leave you out in this wilderness?
Forget it.
The faster you get back to civilization the faster you'll be able to send help for me.
-l am not leaving you-- -Roger the mission comes first.
All right.
l'll come back and pick you up myself.
Oh, and look, don't burn yourself out.
Slow and easy does it.
Okay.
Tony l was just thinking.
You won't be doing much walking.
-Could l have your other shoe?
-My other shoe?
Yeah.
lt'd be kind of a change of diet and it did smell like roast lamb, and.
Okay.
But promise me you won't eat it unless there's absolutely nothing else around.
And don't overcook it.
l'll check with you every three hours.
-l'll be here.
-You'll be here.
Okay.
Your friend is a good man.
Yeah.
None better.
lt will be hot out there.
lf you like, l could make a cooling shower of rain for him.
l'd like to put him in an air-conditioned car.
Now stop that.
He's got to do this on his own otherwise the whole mission is for nothing.
You understand?
No.
But if you want your best friend to suffer.
-Hello, Tony?
-Yeah, Roge.
l must be doing something wrong.
lt tastes like shoe.
l'm sorry, Roge.
This cactus you gave me tastes exactly like-- Like melon.
Boy, I wish I had your imagination.
Jeannie, it's against my principles but you better get us out of here.
l won't have Roger risking his life coming back for me.
Get me some fast transportation fast.
Well as you say, master.
This is not exactly what l had in mind.
lt is the only way to travel.
Tony, l left him behind that butte five days ago.
-We gotta find him.
-Captain Nelson's already in.
He's already in?
Captain Nelson's already in?
Amazing.
Unbelievable.
-Couldn't the scale be wrong?
-No, captain.
Let's face it.
You not only survived, you gained five pounds.
l'm sorry, sir.
And one ounce.
That's not the worst of it.
How am l gonna explain your condition?
Why, you're in perfect health.
-What about my elbow?
-Yes.
-What about that elbow?
-lt hurts.
lsn't that something?
l know it hurts, and l know why it hurts.
-There's only one thing that could be.
-What?
Gout.
You know what'll happen to me when l write that in the test report?
They won't only throw me out of the space program they'll laugh me out of the medical profession.
Well, can we just forget about the gout, sir?
-No.
-No.
-And l have an even bigger problem.
-What, sir?
Explaining how a man walks across the desert in his stockinged feet and winds up with saddle sores.
Get your clothes on, wait for me.
l'm not through with you yet.
Would you mind turning around?
Too rich food.
-That doctor, l do not think l like him.
-Well, if he caught you here l don't think he'd be too happy either.
You better beat it.
-l wish to help.
-No.
There's no way for you to get me out of this spot, Jeannie.
l've gotta tell the doctor the whole truth.
lt may mean my career.
Well, then why tell him?
Because, Jeannie, the results of my survival test are gonna be used to train future astronauts.
Only they won't have a genie.
l can't let them send those poor kids out in that desert thinking they'll make out as well as l did.
ls it any wonder l love you?
He may be in better physical shape but l bet l'm in better mental shape.
Oh, hello, doctor.
Roger!
Your feet, what happened?
Blisters this big, that's what happened.
Boy, you try walking on a desert, you'll have blisters too.
Only come to think about it, you couldn't have because you didn't have any shoes because l ate one of them and.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait, what did happen out there?
Well, l've been trying to figure out a way of telling you, doc.
But Roger chose the hard way, and l chose the easy way.
Obviously.
Captain Healy lost 1 2 pounds travelling 30 miles in seven days while you turned up three days early, 7 5 miles from the drop zone and looking like the guest of honour at the gourmet's club.
Explain that.
How come you didn't let me in on the easy way?
l wanted to, Roge, but l couldn't.
Well, what l mean is.
-What?
What?
-Well while you were collecting cactus and bones and feathers, l was.
l was having a big meal of chicken soup and roast lamb and melon and there l was lying in this beautiful silk tent.
No fair.
No fair.
That's my mirage he's doing.
A beautiful tent and beautiful food?
-No beautiful girl?
-There was in my mirage.
-After l ate the melon.
-Don't listen to him.
Aside from what was on the ground, the only thing he ate was his left shoe.
lt was my right shoe, and l didn't eat it.
Remarkable.
And the 7 5 miles?
l rode most of the way.
-On a camel?
-Yes.
That was my mirage too.
l must have told him on the walkie-talkie.
Of course you did.
You saw it, but he rode it.
-Very interesting.
-Wait a minute.
Wait, doc.
-You don't believe him, do you?
-Of course not.
But the important thing is that he believes it.
A remarkable manifestation of mind over matter.
You see, Captain Nelson was so convinced the food was there he not only put on weight, he got the gout.
And as for your camel, he got the saddle sores.
Then you don't think l'm crazy.
You won't kick me out of the program?
Well, hardly.
We need men like you-- Men of imagination and determination.
--if we're to survive on the moon.
Thank you, sir.
You'll never regret this.
l'm recommending you for the most difficult mission we have yet devised: Operation Extinction.
Look, Roge.
This is.
Roge?
Then l'm really going with you.
l wouldn't tackle Operation Extinction without you.
l'm so pleased.
You will love the desert of Saudi Arabia.
l know a pool there.
Oh, l bet you do.
All right.
ln your bottle.
-But-- -ln.
l'm sorry, Jeannie.
l know this is a dirty trick and l hate myself but l'm going to accomplish this mission on my own.
With nothing going for me.

She wanted to have fun.
And she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there in this house, the girl in the bottle plays spin the astronaut.
l wonder what it is about mental work that makes you so hungry.
l wish l had a cheese sandwich.
Oh, hello, Jeannie.
You wouldn't fix me a cheese sandwich, would you?
l'd go to the delicatessen myself but if l'm gonna finish this before l pick up Melissa -l won't have a chance.
-Melissa?
The black-haired witch.
You be careful, young lady.
That's the girl l'm gonna marry.
Her vibrations are all wrong for you.
That's funny.
l kind of like the way she vibrates.
She will never make you happy, master.
Let's just stick to the cheese sandwich, Jeannie.
Well, if this is what you really wish.
That is what l really wish.
What's this doing in my study?
What's the idea?
Before one can make a cheese sandwich one must first make the cheese.
Yeah.
Yeah, that figures.
-Wasn't that fun?
-Yeah.
-I never danced so much in my life.
-Thanks for driving me home, Melissa.
-l'll-- l'll see you tomorrow.
-l have a wonderful idea.
Why don't you lure me inside so we can snuggle up in front of a roaring fire with a couple of hot toddies and talk about our honeymoon?
Well, l-- l wish l could, Lis, but, we better not.
l'm a terribly messy housekeep-- l'll clean it up for you.
Yeah.
Tony!
You read my mind.
What?
-You even lit a fire.
-l did?
Yeah, l did, didn't l?
Oh, look at those.
-Hi.
-You seem so nervous.
Oh, do l?
Do l?
Premarital jitters.
An occupational hazard for us bachelors.
-Why wait?
-What?
Why don't we simply move up the wedding date?
Well, yeah, that's a marvellous idea.
Oh, Tony.
Wait till l get you in Jamaica.
l guess l'll have to, won't l?
lt won't be too long.
-Tony.
-Yeah?
-May l ask you something?
-Sure.
-What are we whispering about?
-Whispering?
Well, it's just some things you don't discuss in public.
You mean, the walls have ears?
Yeah.
Something like that.
You look a little tired.
l think you better get some rest.
l'll go.
Yeah, that's a good idea.
l mean, you look tired too, darling.
You need some rest.
Of course l will.
And thanks for being so understanding, Melissa.
-Good night.
-Good night.
-Listen, Jeannie.
-The black-haired witch is right.
Thou art very nervous.
She has upset you.
She's upset me?
What do you think you've been doing?
Do you really love that one?
Well, l wouldn't be marrying her if l didn't.
Well, if this is what you really want l will try to serve you and make both of you happy.
Oh, we will have a wonderful honeymoon.
Wait a minute.
l don't think you know the ground rules.
l am taking Melissa to Jamaica on our honeymoon.
Jamaica.
That sounds nice.
We will have a good time there.
l will serve you ripe figs in bed-- -Oh, no, you won't.
-Dates?
No, no.
Nothing.
You won't be there.
But why?
No offence, Jeannie, but on a honeymoon two is company and three is-- Three is just out of the question.
-But l am your-- -No, no, no.
Melissa is in, you are out.
There's not enough room in my life for both of you.
But l take up very little room and l'll make that one happy too.
Oh, boy.
That'll be the day.
Even if she is the wrong girl for you.
-Will you stop saying that.
-Oh, but it is true.
You will be throwing your life away.
lt is not so, and-- And it's my life.
And l can throw it any place l please.
l could change myself into a brunette.
How do you like the Helen of Troy look?
Have a nice trip home.
Boy.
lf there's anything l can't stand, it's a nagging genie.
Figures.
Come in.
-Hello, Tony.
-General.
Lis.
-Tony.
-l just ran into Roger.
l want you to meet a very old friend of the family.
-Grover Caldwell.
-How do you do.
So you're the lucky man.
Lis has told me all about you.
Oh, has she?
Good.
Grover, tell him the news.
Captain, after a long and honourable military career the department has prevailed upon General Stone to turn in his stars for a pair of striped trousers and an attachÃ© case.
Turn in your stars?
That's State Department talk.
Meaning that Daddy is our newest ambassador.
Well, congratulations, sir.
That's wonderful news.
Thank you, Tony.
lt's a great opportunity for both of us.
Yes, yes.
l'm sure it will be.
Us?
Who do you think he's taking to Europe as his military attachÃ©?
Don't get the idea that it's just because you're going to be the father of my grandchildren that you're getting this plum.
l'd have wanted you with me in any case.
You have a lot to talk about so l'll just pop off and take care of the passports and clearances.
Tony.
-Oh, yes.
Pleasure.
-General.
-Sir.
l-- -Tony?
-Don't you think it's wonderful?
-Well, now, slow down.
Slow down.
l can't quit what l'm doing.
-lt's a great opportunity, Tony.
-Of course it is.
Tony just hasn't had time to think about it.
Well, we can all discuss this at dinner.
We are coming to your house for dinner tonight?
Yes, of course.
But there's nothing to discuss.
l'm in the space program because that's where l wanna be.
l don't mean to sound ungrateful, sir.
And l know you'll make a wonderful-- A fine ambassador.
Well, l'll-- l'll see you both at 7.
Congratulations again, sir.
Thank you, Tony.
Frozen peas.
Frozen hors d'oeuvres.
And wild rice.
What are you doing, master?
l'm preparing dinner.
Why?
Well, cooking is women's work.
You wouldn't.
Would you?
Oh, if you did that, you'd save my life.
l have a report to finish.
-Do you know anything about cooking?
-Everything.
l will take care of it.
You go soak your body in a warm tub scented with rose petals.
Well, that's a good idea, but l don't think so right now.
lf you wanna know anything about the cooking the instructions are on the back of the boxes.
You do read, don't you?
Right to left, left to right, top to bottom or bottom to top.
Left to right, top to bottom.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, what's going on down--?
Two thousand years ago my sister made better gravy than that.
And she was the worst cook in the Middle East.
That's them.
Melissa's always on time.
Now, l have to take them out to dinner.
Will you do me a favour, please, huh?
Will you just stay out of sight?
-Good evening.
-Tony.
Oh, here's your hat.
Keep this, you're not staying.
l've got to apologize for the burning smell.
lt's the dinner.
l never smelled anything more appetizing in my whole life.
Oh, Tony.
Why, it's-- lt's beautiful.
Oh, it's nothing, really.
Captain Nelson!
-Who's that?
-Who's who?
Now, Melissa.
You don't wanna go in the kitchen.
The wild rice went crazy.
Please, please, now-- Tony.
Excuse me.
Tony, you never told me that you had a houseboy.
Oh, no.
No, l didn't, did l?
Where did you ever find?
What's his name?
-Kato.
-Jeannie.
-Jeannie Kato.
-Those look marvellous.
May l?
-Fantastic.
Try one, Melissa.
-Oh, l'd love to.
Why don't you try several?
l'll be with you in a minute.
Jeannie Kato, these look beautiful.
Who do you think you're gonna fool with this disguise?
lt is no disguise.
See?
lf l had a houseboy that could cook like this l wouldn't pull his hair.
Marvellous.
You must give me the recipe for this.
-What do you call it?
-Ragout Ã  la Sinbad.
Why only the recipe?
l think we ought to take Jeannie Kato to Europe with us.
-Would you like that?
-Thou art going to Europe?
-No.
-Yes.
We'll discuss this later, Melissa.
l'll be very happy to go with you wherever you go.
No, you wouldn't.
You wouldn't like it.
But he's such a treasure.
And good help is impossible to get.
Even harder to get rid of.
With dishes like Ragout Ã  la Sinbad our embassy'd be the social centre of Europe.
Where in the world did you ever learn to cook like this?
Where l come from, it is very common.
Very.
Where do you come from?
-Constantinople.
-Philippines.
His mother travelled a lot.
Good night.
Don't forget.
Thank you, Jeannie Kato.
That was the best cake l've ever tasted in my whole life.
-Thank you.
-l'm sorry you won't come to Europe.
Who says he won't?
We'll talk about this later, okay?
Well, now, wait a minute.
Kato is not going to Europe.
As a matter of fact, l'm not going to Europe and neither is my wife.
Well, anything you say, darling.
Good night, Lis.
Good night, Dad.
Sir.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Dark-haired one will get her way.
She's very strong-minded.
Just keep out of this, fella.
We are going out!
No.
l am going out.
l'm going to a bachelor party.
Oh, what's this '' bachelor's party''?
lt's an old tradition, Jeannie.
Before a wedding, a bunch of happy, carefree bachelors get together and throw a party for the groom-to-be.
-l like parties.
-You can't come.
But why?
Because women aren't allowed.
Now, smoke out.
-But l-- -Out!
A million bottles on the beach, and l had to pick hers.
Get out!
l just got here.
Well, glad to see you.
Well, is the condemned man ready for the--?
Wait.
You do look like a condemned man.
Oh, come on.
Let's get this thing over with, huh?
You sound like you're going to a hanging.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing wrong with Melissa either.
She's a little strong-minded.
-Nothing wrong with that.
-Course not.
-She's intelligent, reasonable.
-Sure.
l'm lucky to have her.
You have last-minute jitters, haven't you?
-Come on, we better get out of here.
-Yeah.
One hand.
Why don't we just drink up and forget all the shoptalk, okay?
-Tony.
-Captain.
How about a toast to the best man?
-Thank you very much, general.
-Here's to Grover.
Grover?
Wait a minute.
lf he's the best man, what does that make me?
The astronaut most likely to be in Port Moresby tomorrow.
We have a very important mission for you, captain.
-Will you excuse us, gentlemen?
-Yes.
Of course, sir.
lf you'd rather have him for your best man why didn't you come out and say so instead of having your private general ship me to Australia?
Private general?
l didn't know about this.
Oh, sure you didn't.
Roger.
Roger, wait a minute.
l can straighten everything out.
Anything wrong, captain?
-No, sir.
-You're not nervous about all this?
Oh, well, a little.
You know how it is.
No, l don't.
l wish l did.
ln all the years l've been practicing psychiatry you're the most interesting person l've met.
-Oh, thank you, sir.
-Oh, l-- l was speaking clinically.
What do you find so interesting about me?
Well, you don't fit into any known category.
One minute you're calm, the next, you're hysterical.
You passed the most difficult test the Air Force has devised yet, you hear voices.
You're a top scientist and you suffer from delusions.
You don't call that interesting?
l can't wait to put you in a book.
-You need this.
-Well, thanks.
l'm afraid l have to be running along now.
But, captain.
-Yes.
Yes, sir?
-l'll be seeing you.
Yes.
Well, here we go, lover-boy.
Time to cut the cake.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Where is it?
Gentlemen, gather round.
Come on.
Let's go.
-What are you doing here?
-l wanted to see your bachelor party.
-Get out of here.
-Tony.
-Sir.
-General.
lt is nice to see you again.
-Do we know each other?
-Well, of course.
Oh, you do not remember.
You admired my cake.
Yeah, her cake, her ca-- Oh, her cake!
-Oh, yes.
Yes.
-lt's beautiful.
Tony, l'll see you Saturday morning.
Saturday morning?
-At your wedding.
-Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Good night.
He will make an excellent father-in-law for someone.
Yeah.
Salt of the earth.
-l hope l'm not intruding.
-Hello, Grover.
Jeannie, this is Grover Caldwell.
-lt is a pleasure.
-The pleasure's mine.
Well, by this time Saturday you and Melissa will be honeymooning in Honolulu.
-Jamaica.
-Honolulu.
Oh, didn't Melissa tell you?
l'm sorry.
l'm sure she meant to.
Well, no, no.
it probably slipped her mind.
You and Melissa are old friends?
We grew up together.
Melissa and l were inseparable in those days.
The horse show, water-skiing.
Even went to the same orthodontist.
By the time we had the braces taken off l was on my way to prep school, Melissa went to West Point.
Just lost track of each other.
Until a few weeks ago.
Melissa's very fond of you.
She spoke highly of you at dinner last night.
Oh, l'm very fond of her too.
lt's funny how things work out.
Melissa and l had such great dreams together and now in two days you two will be honeymooning in Honolulu.
-Jamaica.
-Oh, Honolulu.
-Jamaica.
-Honolulu.
-Jamaica.
-Don't count on it.
l know Melissa.
-So do l. -So do l. -l don't know what you're selling-- -Good morning.
-Morning, Tony.
-Come on in.
-Sit down.
-l'd rather stand, thank you.
-What's on your mind, Grover?
-You're making a terrible mistake.
Which one?
l mean, how do you mean?
By not accepting the position as General Stone's military attachÃ©.
lt's a unique opportunity careerwise.
lt can only offer enormous opportunities later on.
Well, l'm very thankful for your concern about my career but l don't think it's any of your business.
l feel that whatever has to do with Melissa is my business.
Obviously you're not thinking of her feelings.
lf you were, you'd see the enormous opportunity.
Okay.
All right.
l can't handle this without coffee.
Let me get dressed, and we'll discuss this over breakfast.
Make yourself-- Make yourself at home.
You do love me.
You've loved me for a long time.
Why have you k ept it such a secret?
Oh, and I love you too.
I know now I've always loved you.
There is still time to mak e our dreams come true.
Oh, well, now where were we?
She's too good for you!
Melissa.
Tony.
Grover?
Oh, it's all right, sir.
l think we're gonna be married.
-What?
-That's right.
l've known Grover all my life and he waits until the day before my wedding to tell me that he loves me.
-But l thought you loved Tony.
-l did.
But he's just not the man l became engaged to.
l'm-- Well, l'm very disappointed in Tony.
He-- He lacks ambition.
Well, we can't all make general.
Well, l know.
All l wanted to do was to try to help him.
And he seems to resent it.
Well, on the day before your wedding, l'd say you have a problem.
Listen, Melissa, there's a few things l wanna get straightened out.
ln the first place, l don't want your ex-boyfriend telling me where l'm gonna honeymoon.
And l don't like my best man being picked for me.
And l don't like having plans made for my future -l brought you a drink.
-when l don't think it-- What?
Thanks, Jeannie.
You must be a mind reader.
Oh, no.
No.
l cannot read minds, master.
But l have a friend, Nostradamus, who does a marvellous job.
l bet you do.
You know, l'm gonna miss you.
You know, you're-- You're really very nice.
l mean, take this, for instance.
l didn't even have to ask you for it.
And that dinner you made.
That was fantastic.
Well, of course it was fantastic.
But it was also delicious.
Well, l'm pleased that you enjoyed it, master.
Yeah.
You're always thinking of what l like.
You'd never send Roger to Australia, would you?
And you wouldn't make plans for my honeymoon without consulting me, would you?
Are you expecting Nostradamus or someone?
Here.
You-- You stay out of sight.
l'll get this.
Well, speak of the devil.
l mean, we've been talking about you-- -l mean, l've been thinking-- Come in.
-Tony.
-l'm sorry.
-What?
For disturbing you so late.
But Grover and l must talk to you.
As a matter of fact, l've been wanting to talk to you.
-Tony.
Tony, now, the simple truth is-- -Yeah.
-Grover.
-Melissa wants to marry me.
That is, Melissa and l want to be married.
l'm sorry, Tony.
lt's just that.
Well, you're-- You're not the man l became engaged to.
And l don't think you realize how much you've changed.
Oh, l know it hurts now.
But in time, you'll realize it's all for the best.
Well, l hope you two will be very happy together.
Thank you, Tony.
l hope you find the right girl.
l'm really not looking for anyone.
You're taking this very decently.
Well, we can't win them all.
What?
Naturally, it'll hurt at first.
l'll just have to learn to live with it.
Goodbye, Tony.
Goodbye, Lis.
Grover.
Boy, was that close.
Thou wilt never know how close, master.
Well, things always work out for the best.
You mean you are not unhappy that your marriage was called off?
Unhappy.
Unhappy?
Jeannie, this is the first time in months l've felt absolutely free.
Oh, boy.
Oh, master, thou has a lot to learn.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.
The missile went up, but something went wrong and they had to bring it down.
Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific, where he found a bottle.
At least it looked like a bottle.
But it didn't act like a bottle.
Because in it was a genie.
Oh, not your average, everyday genie but a beautiful genie who could grant any wish.
Captain Nelson was so grateful, he set Jeannie free.
Only she didn't want to be free.
You know how it is when you've been cooped up in a bottle for 2000 years.
She wanted to have fun and she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there, in this house, the girl in the bottle plays spin the astronaut.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
All right now, Jeannie, come on out of there.
Now, come on.
l mean it.
Okay, young lady, this time you've gone just too far.
All right, now, come on.
-Thou hast tried to drown me.
-Oh, yeah?
Don't tempt me.
All right, now, what did you do with them?
What did l do with what?
The papers l brought home from the air base this afternoon.
-The ones you said were important?
-Yes, those are the ones.
l put them in my desk, and they're not there.
Well, of course not.
Since you told me of their importance, l hid them where they would be safe.
Jeannie, l told you never to touch my papers.
lf they'd been lost, l'd be in really big trouble.
l put them in a hiding place where they will never be found.
Well, they're-- They are.
They are hidden.
Yes, yes, l know that.
But where are they hidden?
Are they--?
Are they under a cushion?
Under the rug?
Behind a picture?
ln a book?
ln a purse?
ln a hatbox?
-That's it.
-What?
A suitcase.
l took the small suitcase from the hall closet.
And then l very carefully put the papers inside.
Then l carefully locked it.
Then l very carefully took the key-- And you carefully hid it?
ln a place where nobody would ever find it.
That is right.
lt is right here.
Oh, Jeannie.
Please, don't scare me like that.
You did not think l had lost it?
Well, you must admit that you had a little difficulty in remembering you had put the papers in the suitcase.
But l had no difficulty remembering where l had hidden the key to the suitcase.
No.
No, that's true.
l'm only too glad to humbly apologize for doubting you but-- Wait, master.
lf you do not mind, l would rather have you humbly apologize after.
After what?
After l remember where l've hidden the suitcase.
No, no.
No, thanks, Jeannie.
l've got to get going.
l got a ton of work waiting for me on my desk.
Will you be home for dinner tonight, master?
l'm afraid not, Jeannie.
Looks like another late session.
Again?
You have had to work late every night this week.
l'm assigned to a pretty important project.
That is because you are the wisest master in the whole world.
Listen, l gotta get going.
Have a good day, Jeannie.
Are you not going to kiss me goodbye?
Now, remember our bargain.
This is a purely platonic relationship.
Oh, yes.
Purely platonic.
You agreed to keep it on that basis because you knew it was the best way.
No.
l agreed because l did not know what '' platonic'' meant.
lt's another name for friendship.
Pals.
Good buddies.
Then what about a friendly kiss goodbye?
Well, l don't suppose there's any harm in that.
You're the best buddy a buddy ever had.
Tony.
Do you have a minute for a cup of coffee?
Sure, Roge.
lt'll have to be a quick one.
Boy, what a depressing day this figures to be.
Yeah, l know.
This paperwork's getting me down too.
lt's not the paperwork that's bugging me.
lt's Beverly.
-Beverly?
-Yeah, Beverly Anderson.
She's a lieutenant in the WAFs.
l met her a couple weeks ago at the club.
Oh, man, what a woman.
Tony, wanna know something?
lt was love at first sight.
-Again?
-No, this time l really mean it.
She's everything l ever looked for in a woman.
Everything.
-Well, l'd like to meet her, Roge.
-You can't.
-You can't, you can't, you can't.
-Why?
-She's in North Africa.
-North Africa?
Shipped out this morning.
There's a big personnel shortage and all new WAF units are being sent overseas.
-Well, that's a tough break, Roge.
-Tough?
lt's a disaster of my life.
l flip over a girl who's crazy about me, the day l'm gonna propose to her -off she goes to Africa.
-How long is she gonna be gone?
-Eight months.
-Eight months?
By then, there's bound to be someone else.
Someone else?
There will probably be dozens.
Well, if Beverly's so crazy about you why would she look for somebody else?
Who's talking about Beverly?
l was talking about me.
Tony, eight months is a long time, you know.
We-- These girls may not be Beverly, but they're here.
Now, let's see what we have in the little old goody book.
And we have Beverly, Elizabeth, and we have.
Thanks for cheering me up, Tony.
You've been a real-- Tony?
-l thought you would never get here.
-What are you doing here?
-l miss you.
-l just left the house.
-But that is when l miss you most.
-You gotta get out of here.
Come on.
-May l not stay for just a few minutes?
-No, absolutely not.
l'm working with classified material.
lf you're seen, l'd be court-martialed.
-No one will see me.
-Yes, they will.
My secretary.
You have a secretary?
Well, certainly l have a secretary.
And when you work nights, the secretary is here with you?
Of course.
-What does she look like?
-She looks like a 45-year-old man.
-Your secretary's a man?
-Yes.
Sergeant Cushing.
Now, come on.
That's Cushing.
Sergeant, just hold on a minute.
l'm on the phone.
l'll just be a minute.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Well, wherever you are, just stay there, huh?
Come on in, sergeant.
l'm Corporal Burns, captain.
l've been assigned as your secretary.
What happened to Sergeant Cushing?
He's been transferred.
l know this is rather short notice but l hope you won't be too disappointed in his replacement.
Oh, no.
No.
Well, l feel it's only fair to warn you that this job requires quite a bit of night work.
l'm quite used to that, captain.
Well, l might as well show you where everything is.
This is our supply closet here.
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.
-l just forgot l had something in there.
-What?
Well, l can't say.
Hush-hush stuff?
Hush-hush stuff.
Oh, very hush-hush.
As a matter of fact, l'd better take care of that right now -before l start anything new.
-Can l help?
l'm cleared for classified material, you know.
No, this is not exactly classified.
l consider it more, top-secret.
Why don't you check back with me in an hour.
Well, okay.
Bye.
Bye.
Jeannie, you can come out-- Jeannie, now, come on out.
Come on.
-l am ready when you are, boss.
-Boss?
ls that not what your secretary is supposed to call you?
What are you talking about?
Oh, l see.
You think l've lost my mind.
l'm gonna let you be my secretary.
l will be a better one than that Corporal Burns.
And l do not mind working nights either.
ln the first place, you can't type.
ln the second place, you can't file.
You can't take dictation.
You can't even sharpen a pencil-- Well, how about that.
l'm ready when you are, captain.
l told you l would be a good secretary.
Good?
You're terrific.
You're fantastic.
-l get the job, master?
-No.
-No?
Why not?
-Because this is a military base a rather important one too.
Because of security reasons, they do not use civilian personnel.
ln order to be your secretary, l would have to join the Air Force.
And you certainly wouldn't want to do that.
l think it is a marvellous idea.
Then we could be together all the time.
There's a few facts you'd better get straight first.
-Facts?
What facts?
-l talked to Roger Healey.
lf you join, you know where you'd be going?
-Where?
-You'd be going-- You'd be going into the finest organization in the world.
l want you to be proud of me.
l'm going to become a wonderful WAF.
And l will do it without using a single genie trick.
Come in.
-May l help you, please?
-l'm Captain Nelson.
-We spoke on the phone this morning.
-Of course, captain.
lt's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
This is the young lady that wants to become a WAF.
-Yes, ma'am.
-There isn't a finer, nobler career you could have chosen.
Would you like to sit down?
Jeannie.
Well, let's get a little information on her, all right?
-Name?
-My last name?
-Nelson.
-Nelson.
Oh, then she's a relative of yours, sir?
Yes, yes.
Sort of.
What relation is she to you, sir?
-Wife.
-Cousin.
-l beg your pardon?
-My wife's cousin.
-Date of birth?
-July 1 st.
July 1 st.
-Year?
-Twenty-one B.C. Age?
Fifteen hundred.
-And place of birth?
-Pompeii.
Pomp-- ''Twenty-one B.C. Fifteen hundred years old.
'' l know l should have been honest with you, lieutenant.
-l am not really 1 500.
-l really didn't think so.
l am 2000.
But every woman lies about her age.
Now, l'm afraid Jeannie tends to be a bit of a practical joker.
There's no harm intended.
Just in the spirit of fun, you know.
She's enlisting in the WAFs, captain, not in the Camp Fire Girls.
Give us a new application.
We'll go into another room and fill it out.
No sense bothering you with all this, is there?
Well, all right, captain.
Go in the room across the hall.
Well, thank you very much.
Jeannie.
Thanks again.
Are you certain we are doing the right thing?
Absolutely.
You'll be right where you belong.
lt is here, master.
Look, a letter from the United States Air Force.
What does it say?
Have you been accepted?
l do not know.
l'm too nervous to open the envelope.
Well, all right, let's take a look.
Well, what--?
What is it?
What do they say?
Salute when you address an officer, recruit.
Recruit?
You are now a member of the United States Air Force.
ls that not wonderful?
Tonight you'll leave for six weeks basic training -in San Antonio, Texas.
-Now we can be toge-- l leave for what?
Lackland Air Force Base, for six weeks basic training.
That means l will have to be away from you.
-Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
-But six weeks is a lifetime.
Jeannie, it'll pass before you know it.
For both of us.
You'll be busy training, and l'll be busy working.
Yes.
What will your secretary be busy doing?
Just forget about Corporal Burns.
You better get some of your things together.
l do not see why l must go away.
You'll have the time of your life.
Think of the interesting people you'll meet and the things you'll see in North Africa.
-North Africa?
-San Antonio.
You'd better get your gear together.
Yes, sir.
Come in.
-Recruit Nelson reporting, major.
-At ease, recruit.
l've been studying your aptitude tests, and the results are amazing.
-You're quite a remarkable woman.
-Thank you.
As you know, these tests determine your main interests and ability.
They help us to place you in the jobs that you seem best suited to.
What did you find out about me?
The average girl usually shows ability in several different fields.
We've given you five separate tests, and the answer's always the same.
lt seems there is only one thing you're qualified to do.
-What is that?
-Nothing.
-How can that be?
-l don't know.
You have a very high lQ rating.
To say that you're capable of nothing -just doesn't seem right.
-No.
Before you enlisted, you must have been doing something.
-Oh, yes, l was.
-What?
Nothing.
Well, we've just got to find some kind of job for you to do.
l would make a wonderful secretary for Captain Anthony Nelson.
Wouldn't we all, my dear.
Let's see, the hospital is usually short-handed.
Perhaps you'd make a good nurse's aide.
A nurse's aide?
l do not think so.
You have your orders.
Report to Lieutenant Grant, charge nurse.
And that will be all.
Dismissed.
l am truly sorry, colonel.
l really do not know what to say.
Well, l've got plenty to say.
Major Fiefield, this is Colonel Fenton.
Yes, colonel.
What can l do for you?
Take back that nurse's aide you sent over yesterday.
Recruit Nelson?
Really, colonel, do you think it's fair to judge a girl after one day?
She needs time to learn.
She's had all the time she's gonna get in my hospital.
We're supposed to cure injuries here, not cause them.
Oh, dear.
What happened?
She wanted to learn how to work our traction apparatus and some nitwit doctor let her use him as a patient.
The poor numbskull wound up with a broken leg.
She broke his leg?
In three places.
Of course, if he had the brains of a polliwog he wouldn't have gone along with such an asinine idea.
Well, l'm terribly sorry, colonel.
Tell Nelson to report to me at once.
With pleasure, major.
Major Fiefield would like to see you.
Yes, sir.
Yes?
Pardon, sir, but you'll be late for the staff meeting.
Tell them l'll be right there.
And that's really all there is to it.
l don't think l'd make a very good driver, sergeant.
l want to be secretary to Captain Anthony Nelson.
Look, take it up with the president.
l'm here to teach you to drive a jeep.
But what if l scratch the paint or dent a fender?
This baby's indestructible.
You couldn't hurt it if you hit a brick wall.
Okay, recruit, take off.
Come in.
-You sent for me, major?
-Yes.
These are the reports from the various departments in which you've worked.
l wanted you to hear them.
-Yes, ma'am.
-From the hospital we have this: '' Dangerous.
Approach with extreme caution.
'' From the dental lab: ''Strongly urge that Recruit Nelson be declared a disaster area.
'' Sergeant Morgan, the driving instructor, writes: ''A terrifying experience.
'' Administration says: ''Should be ideal for demolition work.
'' Now today l believe we worked in communications.
However, l haven't heard anything from them, so far.
You will get a phone call as soon as the power lines are working again.
We haven't found our little niche yet, have we, Nelson?
l want to be secretary to Captain Nelson-- You've no experience.
You've got to take tests-- -l've already taken them.
-When?
Between the jeep crash and the explosion at the communication switchboard.
Here's my score.
l'm afraid you're just wasting your-- Two hundred and fifty words a minute!
No one can type that fast.
That was not typing.
That was dictation.
Two hundred and fifty words a minute -in longhand?
-lt is easier to read that way.
l got a score of 400 words in typing.
Unbelievable.
Yeah, l told you l would make a good secretary.
You'd be the ideal girl for Colonel Thomas.
Colonel Thomas?
Commanding officer at Lucas Air Base, North Africa.
Oh, no, no.
l want to be the secretary to Captain Anthony Nelson at Cape Kennedy.
l said Colonel Thomas at Lucas Air Base, North Africa.
Are you sure it was not Captain Nelson at Cape Kennedy?
Of course, l'm sure.
ls there something wrong with your hearing?
l distinctly told you to report to Captain Nelson at Cape Kennedy.
Yes, ma'am.
That is what l thought you said.
-Good morning, corporal.
-Good morning, Captain Master.
Jeannie.
Private Nelson, sir.
l've been assigned as your secretary.
-What happened to Corporal Burns?
-She has been transferred to Lucas Air Base, North Africa.
This is pretty funny.
Are you really my secretary?
l tried to do it without any tricks, as l promised.
But l do not think the WAFs are ready for me.
What would you like me to do first?
Well, first l'd like you to clean out my desk.
And then call the airstrip and find out what flight l'm taking to Nevada.
Oh, yes, sir.
Nevada?
l start training for Operation Moondrop.
-Well, what about me?
-You won't have any problems.
They can always use a good secretary around here.
-But l am your secretary.
-l won't need one where l'm going.
l resign.
Well, you can't.
You just can't.
There's no way out.
l checked.
They only discharge girls if they're troublesome or a disturbing influence, or prove incompetent in their work.
You were saying, master?
l was saying, welcome back to civilian life.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.
The missile went up but something went wrong, and they had to bring it down.
Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle.
At least it looked like a bottle.
But it didn't act like a bottle.
Because in it was a genie.
Oh, not your average everyday genie but a beautiful genie who could grant any wish.
Captain Nelson was so grateful, he set Jeannie free only she didn't want to be free.
You know how it is when you've been cooped up in a bottle for 2000 years.
She wanted to have fun and she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there in this house the girl in the bottle plays Spin the Astronaut.
-Good morning, master.
-Good morning, Jeannie.
You hungry?
-Yes.
-Help yourself to anything you'd like.
l'm not on a menu.
Try the sausage, huh?
Wait a minute.
We got an emergency meeting call this morning.
Oh, boy, l'm going to be late.
Excuse me.
Thou art always away slaving.
Say, tell you what.
Tonight, when it's really good and dark why don't l take you for a long drive on the beach.
How about that?
That sounds wonderful.
What shall l do all day?
Well, you'll think of something.
Goodbye, Jeannie.
l'll see you tonight.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, stop that.
Because of the very nature of this mission we're not going to force anyone to accept this assignment.
We're asking for a volunteer.
Carson?
Davenport?
What about you, Captain Healey?
Colonel, l'd gladly serve above and beyond the call of duty but this is even beyond above and beyond.
Gentlemen, l don't mind telling you l am bitterly disappointed.
Surely there must be one among you willing to undertake this assignment.
Sir, l don't understand what this is all about -but l'd like to-- -Thank you, Captain Nelson.
Report immediately to General Fletcher's office.
Fred, what's this--?
Fred?
Guided tour?
You must be joking, general.
l understood this to be an important mission.
P.J. Ferguson is the president of the largest aerospace firm in the country.
He has served as a technical consultant to NATO.
And Senator Kane of the Armed Forces Appropriations Committee is his closest friend.
-Are you reading me, captain?
-Loud and clear, sir.
Mr. Ferguson and his family are cruising on their yacht.
They stopped by here just for today.
And he specifically suggested a bright, young astronaut for the tour.
You are a bright, young astronaut, are you not, captain?
l always thought l was, sir, until l volunteered for this assignment.
The Fergusons are here, general.
l don't intend to-- Go back on my word, sir.
-l'll be glad to conduct the tour.
-Good man.
-P.J. -Bill.
-This is Captain Tony Nelson.
-Captain.
-How do you do, sir?
-Mr. Ferguson and Miss Ferguson.
Captain Nelson.
l never thought we'd get you.
lt's a privilege.
No, it's my privilege, and an unexpected pleasure.
Been looking forward to this tour, captain.
Wanted to see how our latest component parts are working out.
l'd be happy to show you around, sir.
Not too technical, Father.
Remember, this is still a pleasure trip.
Boy, l feel guilty.
l could have tipped poor Tony off when he came in.
lt's not your fault he wanted to be a hero.
But it's a lousy assignment he got hung up with.
-Miss Ferguson.
-Watch it, guys.
This is a group of the walking wounded.
Shock, you know.
This young man has real engineering savvy, Bill.
Made some interesting suggestions.
Don't get any ideas, P.J., we intend to keep him.
l'd like you and your staff on board the Nina tonight for cocktails.
-We're sailing in the morning.
-Thank you.
l'll pass out the word.
You will be there, won't you, Tony?
l'm sorry, Nina.
l've made other plans.
Nothing that can't be changed, l'm sure.
Well, l did promise someone else, sir, and-- You wouldn't put pleasure before duty, would you, captain?
Especially since this duty is such a pleasure.
Yes, sir.
l'll be there.
She'll understand.
But you don't understand.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
You don't understand!
Oh, l understand.
You promised to take me to the beach but instead, you'd rather go out on someone's yacht.
l was ordered to.
lt's business.
Then l will go with you.
l am very good at business.
Oh, no, you won't.
-And who is to stop me?
-l am.
Oh, come on, now.
Now, stop that, will you?
Look, l don't have any time to fool around.
l'm late as it is.
Jeannie, come on out of there.
Come-- All right, stay in there.
Jeannie, l'd like to talk to you about tonight.
Now, come on.
Come closer.
Sorry about this, Jeannie but your old master has a little modern magic up his sleeve.
Now, you're gonna stay at home tonight, like a good girl.
-Tony!
-Hi.
-Sorry.
-Captain Roger Healey, this is Nina.
Wow.
lf you're the Nina l'd love to see what the Pinta and the Santa Maria look like.
And that, Captain Healey, calls for champagne.
Follow me.
To the ends of the earth.
-Oh, l'm sorry.
-Sorry?
You're sorry?
Captain Roger Healey, U.S. Army.
Of course, you know that if you read the newspapers.
What's it like orbiting the Earth at 1 8,000 miles an hour?
Exhilarating.
The freedom of weightlessness the colour of the sunrise and the sunsets.
Please go on.
You were just getting to the exciting part.
Good evening, Dr. Bellows.
We were talking a little shop.
Sometimes you get carried away and.
Yes.
There's more than one way of getting carried away, captain.
Look, why don't we go inside and talk.
You think that we-- l saw her first.
Captain Roger Healey Commander Jeffrey Slade, my husband.
Nice meeting you, commander.
Guess you saw her first.
Nice talking-- Nice talking to you two.
Well, honey, how are you getting along with young Nelson?
l want him.
That's my girl, straight and to the point.
l'll say one thing for Tony he's miles above those spineless fortune hunters l've had to chase off.
lf we only had more time together.
You leave it to your old dad.
Thank you, darling.
-Thank you.
-Well, captain, you having fun?
Yes, sir, Mr. Ferguson.
Great party.
Well, l'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
Tony, have you ever thought of what you're going to be doing Probably flying economy tours to Mars.
Well, l'm going to be frank with you.
l need a capable, young man like you in my firm.
Someone who can take over for me one day.
Well, l'm very flattered, sir.
Being an astronaut, l-- Well, to be frank l've made the service and the space program my life's work.
With Ferguson Aerospace, you'd still be a very important part of it.
Does it make sense?
l don't know, sir.
Frankly, l don't think l'd be capable of it.
We're sailing for Nassau in the morning.
Come with us.
You'll have a lot of time to think it over and we can become better acquainted.
Well, l'd certainly like to, but l'm doing some very important research, and-- -Well, l'm afraid it'd be impossible.
-Nothing's impossible.
-You leave it to me.
-There you are, darling.
Will you excuse us, Daddy.
Oh, Bill.
Bill, l need a favour of you.
-Anything l can do, P.J., just ask.
-l'm sailing in the morning.
Hello, Mrs. Flaherty.
l forgot you were coming.
lt's Thursday.
Yeah, it is.
You having an orgy?
A group of my friends dropped in.
l'm gonna be leaving town for a few days.
Would you mind tidying up a little bit?
Sure.
Don't use the vacuum cleaner.
There's something wrong with it, a short, l think.
Jeannie, listen, l'm gonna have to leave town for a few days on a secret mission.
Look, l'll make all this up to you when l get back.
l'm sorry l can't take you.
Goodbye.
You promised to take the vacuum cleaner with you?
No, of course not.
lt's a big yacht, they'll have their own.
Goodbye, Mrs. Flaherty.
l'll see you next week.
Goodbye.
You gotta be touched to be one of those astronauts.
Must be the thin air.
Poor dears.
Well, no wonder the vacuum cleaner wouldn't work.
lt has a handkerchief stuck in it.
Won't he be pleased when l fix it.
l think l stumbled on a secret weapon!
Now, isn't this much better than being cooped up in some silly little capsule?
lt's not a little capsule.
lt's a rather large capsule.
-And it's not silly.
-l'm sorry.
That's all right.
Right.
Right.
Up.
Right, right, right.
Up, up.
Oh, yeah.
Why anyone would ever want to be an astronaut in the first place, darling, l'll never know.
l guess l always want to be above everything.
That's another thing l like about you, your sense of humour.
Excuse me, Miss Ferguson.
Your father requests you join him in the salon.
Thank you, Albert.
Tell him l'll be right there.
Yes, ma'am.
-l suppose l'd better get dressed then.
-No, you stay here and l'll see you later for cocktails.
Till later.
Oh!
A secret mission, huh?
She did not leave many secrets.
Jeannie.
Listen, what--?
What are you doing here?
l told you to wait in your vacuum.
-You tricked me!
-l had to.
-l told you, this is business.
-Business seems to be very good.
You gotta get out of here and go back home.
But you will get into trouble if l leave you, master.
You need me.
Well, l need you like l need a hole in my space helmet.
You want to get rid of me so you can be alone with that long-legged one.
l do not want to get rid of you.
lt's just that-- Well, l've had enough.
All l want is to make you happy.
All you're doing is make me miserable.
lt's getting so l can't draw an easy breath wondering when you're gonna pop up.
Now, l'm not kidding.
l'm desperate.
As you wish.
Bon voyage.
Thanks.
-Goodbye.
-Where is she?
She's gone.
Man overboard!
Tony, we've searched the entire ship.
She's not aboard.
And there was no trace of her in the water.
-Of course, with all the sharks-- -There was no girl.
-But we saw her.
-No.
We heard the whole argument up to the point when you pushed her overboard.
-You think l pushed her overboard?
-Pushed who overboard?
-Nobody.
-Tony, l deal in facts.
The fact is you managed to smuggle a girlfriend aboard-- She was not my girlfriend.
-Who?
-Nobody!
Then you told her to go home and wait for you.
Tony, we're only trying to help you.
l swear, there was no girl on board that ship.
-And l'm telling the truth.
-You are?
Then you'd better start thinking up some lies because there isn't a jury in the world that wouldn't hang you.
Well, it's bigger than a capsule.
Smaller than a breadbox.
-Roger, l need your help.
-l'd do anything in the world for you.
-l believe in you.
-Thanks, Roge.
-Why'd you kill her?
-l didn't kill her -and you'll help me prove it.
-What do you want me to do?
l want you to go to my house.
-Want me to bring back something?
-No, just go to my house.
-What for?
-l want you to talk to it.
-Go to your house and talk to it?
-Yes, yes.
A house is like-- Like a living thing.
Over the years, it develops vibrations.
You know, like a dog.
-Your house is like a dog?
-Yeah.
Haven't you ever noticed how people and their dogs look alike?
Well, the same with houses.
Yeah, l've noticed that.
Yeah, l've noticed that.
l want you to go in the living room and talk to the walls.
ls there anything in particular you want me to say to them?
-Say, ''Tony's in trouble.
'' -Tony's in trouble.
-''Tony needs you.
'' -Tony needs you.
-''Tony's very fond of you.
'' -Tony's very fond of you.
-'' But you're hurting him deeply.
'' -You're hurting him deeply.
'' lf you realized you were hurting him, you wouldn't be doing it.
'' lf you realized you were hurting him, you wouldn't be doing it.
-That's it.
-Any particular wall you're close to?
Yeah, yeah.
Try the wall nearest the fireplace.
The wall near the fireplace.
Nice warm wall, that's good.
And have a word with my vacuum cleaner too.
lt's in the hall closet.
l wouldn't leave without saying hello to your vacuum cleaner.
Thanks.
Thanks, Roge.
l'm depending on you.
Promise me you'll do this.
lt means life or death.
-l know it sounds far out, but-- -Far out?
l'll be glad to do it.
Guard!
l'm depending on you.
Here.
Here are the keys.
Yeah, that's right.
Keys.
Gotta have the keys.
-l'll do it.
-Thanks, buddy.
Hello.
Hi, l'm Roger Healey.
Tony sent me.
He wanted me to tell you that he was in trouble, and that he needs you.
And he's very fond of you, and.
That you're hurting him deeply.
lf you knew what you were doing to that poor guy you wouldn't be doing it.
You should be a-- You should be ashamed of yourself.
l mean, what's he ever done to you?
l wouldn't ask this for myself but just for Tony's sake, have a heart, huh?
Be a pal, just this once.
-Captain Healey.
-Yes, sir?
-What were you doing?
-l was talking to the wall, sir.
-May l ask why?
-Yes, sir.
Tony asked me to.
l know this sounds wild, sir, but you see houses get to be your friends, like dogs.
And Tony wanted the walls to know he was in trouble.
He wanted the walls to know he was in trouble.
This wall is a particular friend of his.
l think you'd better get back to the base, captain.
l'll take over.
There's more here than meets the eye.
-Could l have a couple more minutes?
-What for?
Tony asked me to have a talk with his vacuum cleaner.
l'll talk to it.
You run along.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
lt's in the closet.
They're all cracking up.
Good morning.
Good morning.
l'm Dr. Bellows.
l'm a friend of Captain Nelson's.
l wish l knew what your secret was.
Well, whatever it is, we don't need any more evidence.
Captain Nelson is where he can't get into any more trouble.
What is a Nassau?
Don't go away.
Stay right where you are.
First you tell me to leave you and never come back.
And then you say, ''Jeannie, stay where you are.
Don't go away.
'' -Well, what is it you really want of me?
-l want you to stay right where you are.
lf l stay, will you make me a promise?
Anything.
Anything you want.
You will not put me in the vacuum cleaner again.
Well, of course not.
That was a terrible thing to do.
And that woman with the bad legs, you will not see her again?
She didn't have bad le-- l'll never see her again.
And you will take me to the beach tonight?
Yes, Jeannie, anywhere you want to go.
You are wonderful.
l will stay.
General.
Mr. Ferguson.
-Look who's here.
-l phoned Dr. Bellows.
He'll be right-- -Who is that?
-That's the girl on the yacht.
Just call me Jeannie.
Yes, just call her Jeannie.
You sure you won't be needing these things?
No.
lf l never see a yacht again, it'll be too soon.
That's a shame.
The party on the yacht we chartered will be a real gas.
Sure you won't change your mind?
-Give my best to the gang.
-You'll be sorry.
l'm gonna spend a nice, quiet weekend with a bottle.
After what you've been through, l don't blame you.
See you, Tony.
-l am ready.
-All right, Jeannie where do you want to go?
Where we will not be interrupted.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.
The missile went up but something went wrong, and they had to bring it down.
Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle.
At least, it looked like a bottle.
But it didn't act like a bottle.
Because in it was a genie.
Oh, not your average everyday genie but a beautiful genie who could grant any wish.
Captain Nelson was so grateful, he set Jeannie free.
Only she didn't want to be free.
You know how it is when you've been cooped up in a bottle for 2000 years.
She wanted to have fun and she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there, in this house the girl in the bottle plays Spin the Astronaut.
A meeting is expected to be called at Geneva next month.
Turning to the domestic front.
At Cape Kennedy, America's three-man astronaut team is preparing to tak e an historic walk into outer space.
The team consists of Captain Tony Nelson, Captain Roger Healey and Lieutenant George Conway.
It's probable that Captain Nelson, as head of the team will be the first American to step into outer space.
I'll have local news-- -Hello, Nelson here.
-Captain Nelson, Dr. Bellows here.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
l've just been going over some of your reports.
How are you feeling?
Fine, sir.
lsn't that what the reports say?
Oh, the reports look fine.
But in my opinion, you've been a bit jumpy lately.
Me, sir?
Not at all.
l sleep soundly, appetite's good.
l could eat a horse.
Hey, what are you doing--?
Shoo!
Shoo!
Did you say ''shoo''?
l'm sorry, l wasn't-- l wasn't speaking to you, sir.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, would you--?
Would you get this horse out of here?
Captain.
Captain.
Captain, do you have a horse in your living room?
Of course not.
Why would l have a horse in my living room?
l don't know, but we'll find out this afternoon.
l want you to report here at 2:00 for some tests.
Yeah, but-- -Would you get this out of here?
-But you said you could eat a horse.
That's merely an expression.
Now, come on, take him away.
Thanks.
-Anything you desire.
-Just don't get carried away.
You have not seen anything yet, master.
These are the best plover eggs l've ever tasted.
And of course, they're the only plover eggs l've ever tasted.
Have some more sausage, master.
Well, l don't know, Jeannie.
l don't think l better.
-Steak?
-Well.
Veal?
Kidney?
Pork chops?
Jeannie, this is more than l've ever had for breakfast.
Wait until you see the lunch l have planned for you, master.
That's Roge and George.
Do you mind?
Thanks.
Hi, Roge, George.
Let me have your hat.
l've got my charts upstairs.
We better go and take another look at them.
Good.
Look, you guys start without me.
l'm going to grab a cup of coffee.
When you step out of that spaceship, remember, easy does it.
You push yourself away too hard, and you'll never stop spinning.
Our two tricky moments come when we open the hatch to let you out and then when we close it again on your re-entry.
l'll start the decompression when the air lock is pressurized to air space.
l open the door, and out you go.
Watch out for that first step, Tony.
lt's really a honey.
Listen, Roger, l think it's important that you take a look at this too.
There's only one thing that worries me.
When l step out into space, Roge will pilot the ship.
Hey, you know, it might be a good idea if we checked that tether again.
Well, l can't do it right now.
l have something else to do.
More important than checking your space umbilical cord?
-Well, l'll get to it.
l'll get to it.
-Well, anything you say.
Guess we better be running along.
-You are not going.
-Listen here, young lady you've got to stop playing around like that.
l'm not going where?
Walking around in space.
Not without me.
-lt is perfectly safe.
-Except that your tether might break and you might go spinning off into nothing.
What is a tether?
A tether, it's-- Well, it's like a rope.
lt keeps me attached to the space capsule.
Jeannie, l became an astronaut because that's what l want to do.
-Believe me, l know what l'm doing.
-Well, l will not have thee in danger.
Well, young lady, l'm afraid you don't have much say about that.
-l have to get going.
-Where are you going?
l'm going to take a few routine tests.
And if you do not pass these tests?
Well, somebody will be taking my place in that capsule.
But don't worry, l'll pass them.
Thou art a stubborn and foolish man.
Jeannie, there's absolutely nothing to worry about.
l-- Jeannie, thanks a lot.
You be a good girl and l'll come home early, we'll have a nice game of chess, huh?
-Hello.
-Captain Nelson.
Sir, there's really no need for me to take anymore of these tests.
lf l hadn't passed all the tests l've taken l wouldn't be taking this flight on Monday, would l?
Captain, l'm going to be very honest with you.
You baffle me.
l admit that, so far, you've checked out 1 00 percent but there's something.
Some little something that l'm not quite satisfied with.
You don't know what that would be, do you, captain?
-No, of course not.
-Never mind.
l'll find it.
Exactly what are you looking for, sir?
Well, l really don't know, a horse in your living room?
Something that you can see that l can't.
Voices that only you can hear.
Doesn't add up to the picture of an ideal astronaut, does it?
You said l checked out Well, we're going to check you out again.
We just may find a physical clue to the problem.
-That is, if there is a problem.
-Yes, if there is a problem.
-You can change behind that screen.
-Yes, sir.
Now we're going to start you off at three and a half miles an hour.
l could do this all day.
When do we reach the summit?
Will you step down, please?
Something seems to be wrong with my instrument panel.
l'll-- l'll check your heart with my stethoscope.
ls everything all right?
-ls anything the matter?
-Nothing.
-You have a funny look on your face.
-Have l?
-How do you feel?
-Fine, fine.
Excuse me.
Let's try the pulmonary function tester.
Now, let me just check this out.
Fine.
You try it please.
There's a fresh mouthpiece.
Now, just breathe normally.
-Well, how did l do, sir?
-Let me check your heart again.
First, l'll make sure this is working properly.
What's next?
Follow me, please.
Excuse me.
-This is a space arm mobility tester.
-l've never seen one of these gadgets.
lt's a test of coordination under pressure.
Just slip your arm through the glove.
l want to see how many of the small dials you can turn.
-What's the matter?
-l don't know, sir.
lt tickles, that's all.
-Captain.
-Yes, sir.
Just please turn the dials.
Yes, yes.
l'm sorry.
l'm very sorry.
lt's very ticklish.
Well, take your arm out of the glove.
-All right.
-Come over here please.
Jeannie?
-What did you say?
-Nothing, sir.
l had a feeling we weren't alone.
You can be quite sure we are alone, captain.
Can l?
Oh, of course.
Of course.
-Would you get into these, please?
-Yes, sir.
-Get on the ergometer, please?
-Yes, sir.
l want you to start slowly, and then gradually increase the speed.
The pedals are weighted.
You won't be able to go very fast.
Ready?
Go.
-l haven't done this since l was a kid.
-Save your breath, Captain Nelson.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, stop!
-Captain Nelson, you're going too fast!
-You're telling me!
-Stop it!
-l can't!
That's incredible.
Do you realize what a strain that is on the heart?
-Yes, sir, l do.
-Stand up, please.
That'll be all, captain.
Will you get dressed, please?
Am l through?
l would say so.
l mean, am l all right?
The results are beyond my wildest expectations.
Sir, you're going to let me go up in that capsule on Monday, aren't you?
Captain, you don't need a capsule.
All right, where are you?
Jeannie?
l know you're here someplace.
All right, now, come on out.
Very funny.
All right, young lady, come on out.
l enjoyed playing those children's games.
Did you?
Well, you know what you've done to me?
-You might have washed me out.
-That means you will not be allowed to go walking around in space.
l'll be lucky if l'm allowed to walk around in public.
-How could you have done this to me?
-l did it for you.
l must protect you from danger.
You've protected me right out of my life's work.
All right, if you like this coat so much keep it.
Captain Nelson, this is Dr. Bellows.
l have to see you immediately.
l want you to be in my office in five minutes, if not sooner.
That's an order.
Come in.
Here's your dinner, Dr. Bellows.
Thanks, Walter.
l can use it.
l feel a little woozy.
Well, this will fix you up, doctor.
Fine.
Enjoy it.
Thanks, Walter.
Walter!
-You called me, Dr. Bellows?
-There's something wrong with the sandwich.
Every time l take a bite, it's whole again.
Look.
Would you like a doctor, doctor?
Of course not.
l've just been overworking.
Maybe you better go home now, sir.
Yes.
That might be a good idea, Walter.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
-Good night, Walter.
-Good night, sir.
l'm too young to go.
l'm dead.
-Here l am, sir.
-What are you doing here?
You phoned me and told me to rush right over.
l did not.
Or did l?
l really don't know.
-You don't know if you phoned me?
-Well, of course l did.
l'm a sick man.
l think my heart just stopped.
-Your heart just stopped?
-l'll rush right over to the base hospital and turn myself in for observation.
-What about my fitness report, sir?
-Captain, in my condition who am l to presume to judge anyone?
All right, Jeannie.
l think you're back in the space program.
l think so too.
And thanks.
But no more tricks.
-Oh, no, master.
-All right, let's go home.
-You're taking me back?
-Temporarily.
-But no more shenanigans either.
-Oh, no.
l promise.
All right.
My car is-- My car is out front.
Say, would you mind?
You know, you know.
Thanks.
Stop.
Come on, come on.
Cut it out, will you!
Come on!
Now, come on, stop that!
What are people gonna say?
-You have a perfect trajectory, Tony.
-Glad to hear it.
-We're on auxiliary temp.
-Everything is green here.
Tony, are you ready to hit the deck?
As ready as l'll ever be.
Decompression switch on.
l'm opening the hatch.
Hatch is open.
l'm stepping out.
l'm heading for the wild blue yonder.
Check your tether line.
Tether clear.
Easy does it, Tony.
Tony's out of the ship.
All systems normal.
l've left the ship.
l'm floating.
Any reaction?
Are you kidding?
It feels great.
Good evening, master.
Did thou see the beautiful star over there?
Star light, star bright First star I see tonight Wish I may, wish I might Wish this wish comes true tonight Very funny.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.
The missile went up but something went wrong, and they had to bring it down.
Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle.
At least it looked like a bottle.
But it didn't act like a bottle.
Because in it was a genie.
Oh, not your average everyday genie but a beautiful genie who could grant any wish.
Captain Nelson was so grateful, he set Jeannie free.
Only she didn't want to be free.
You know how it is when you've been cooped up in a bottle for 2000 years.
She wanted to have fun and she wanted to have it with Captain Nelson.
So she followed him back to Cocoa Beach a mythical town in a mythical state called Florida.
And there in this house the girl in the bottle plays Spin the Astronaut.
Hi.
l thought you went to sleep.
l thought you went to sleep, master.
No, no.
l decided to work on my model.
lsn't it a beauty?
Very nice.
You must be hungry.
Well, you ate hardly anything for dinner.
l almost made it myself.
-You know what is in it?
-Yes, 4000 calories.
You are without shoes again.
l will go fetch your slippers.
No, no.
Please, don't bother.
Don't bother.
-lt's no bother at all.
-l don't like being fussed over.
When l'm working, l don't like being fussed over.
-But, master, l do not-- -Please don't call me master.
-lt makes me feel like a fat, old caliph.
-Thou art neither old nor fat.
Thou art most handsome.
Am l?
-What did l do with that glue?
-l'll get it.
Now, be careful.
Look, l put a lot of time in on this.
Do l not know it.
Every night, to fashion a child's toy.
lt's not a child's toy.
This is an exact replica of the one we're gonna use next month.
Master?
There's a moon out tonight.
Would it not be pleasant to stroll along the beach?
Yeah.
Yeah, why don't you do that.
There.
There, it's done.
How about that, huh?
Looks real enough to blast off, doesn't it?
Well, master, back to the old drawing board.
What art thou laughing at?
Well, it's a little funny.
What are you reading, Jeannie?
l'm reading a scroll.
''The Emancipation of Modern Woman.
'' What does it mean?
Jeannie-- You don't have to worry about things like that.
But l do.
l want to understand your way of life -so that l can please you.
-Well, you please me very much.
Matter of fact, you're-- You're perfect.
-Dost thou really think so?
-Yes.
Yes, l do.
Do you have to say, ''dost thou''?
We say, ''do you.
'' You think it'd be possible for me to view the sights of your village tonight?
Why, certainly.
Oh, no.
No.
-Why not?
-Well, it's the way you're dressed.
You look like a fugitive from a costume party.
How should l dress?
l don't know.
Why don't you pick out someone that dresses well and copy them.
-No, no.
l don't think you get the idea.
-But you do dress well.
Well, thank you very much.
But l wish you'd stop these silly little tricks.
So except for the manner in which l speak, dress and act l am perfect?
That's right.
Now, you just keep working at it.
Remember, practice makes perfect.
l'm a little late now.
l'll see you tonight.
Master.
Master.
Hiya, Captain Nelson!
How's the old boy?
''Are you a loser in the battle between the sexes?
ls the man in your life aloof, indifferent to you impossible to please?
Does he fail to appreciate what you have to offer as a person, as a female?
'' The answer is obvious.
''The answer is obvious.
One, you must learn how to challenge his masculine arrogance.
Two, you must be independent, self-reliant, unpredictable.
Three, you must learn to cope with him on his own grounds.
ln short, you must become a modern American woman.
'' Check manual mode ECS operation.
Manual mode ECS satisfactory.

You hear me, Tony?
l hear you.
Now give me a reading on your oxygen supply.
O-2 flow is normal.
Okay.
l'll bring you down, Tony.
-Roger.
-Yeah?
l mean, roger, l'm coming down.
Hi, Roge.
Must have been a blockage in the oxygen valve.
We'll have it checked.
-How are we feeling?
-Hungry, sir.
Well, didn't you eat your tube of roast beef?
-That's what made me hungry.
-l'll see you in the morning, captain.
-All right.
-Get dressed.
l got a real treat for you.
l found the greatest Chinese restaurant run by a Greek, and the egg foo yung: Count me out.
l'm gonna have dinner at home.
Really?
How did you swing that, old bachelor buddy?
l have a girl who comes in part-time.
-And she cooks dinner for you?
-Sure.
Every night.
-Where did you find this treasure?
-l picked her up on the beach.
See you, Roge.
Think you could have this girl cook for both of us some night?
No, no, no.
You wouldn't like it.
She's a terrible cook.
Jeannie, l'm home.
Well, what's going on?
Jeannie, are you there?
Jeannie?
Now, what is going on here?
Jeannie.
-There-- -Hiya, master.
How's the old boy?
How's the old boy?
What have you been doing?
-l've been doing nothing.
-Well, l know that but l mean, what have you been doing?
l have been studying the '' Emancipation of Modern Woman.
'' Oh, that.
l guess you got so caught up in it -you forgot to do the housework.
-l did not forget.
-l decided to let you do it.
-Me?
'' How not to be a drudge.
Share the work with him.
'' -Now, come on-- -That's what it says.
But that advice is for ordinary women.
Now, you're not ordinary women.
You're a genie, Jeannie.
l mean, all you have to do is bat your eyes, and presto.
No more presto.
You must not take me for granted.
l never did that in my-- l never-- And besides, l'm an astronaut.
l'm not a housekeeper.
-You must widen your horizons.
-Yes, and you must take a little-- Here, l have a present for you.
Now, that-- This is going just too far.
Oh, no, you don't.
No, you don't!
Jeannie!
Jeannie, no, no, no!
Jeannie.
Will you just calm down?
-Yes?
-Delivery for Mrs. Nelson.
Mrs. Nelson?
Where do you want these?
-Back at the store.
-l'll take them.
-Sign this, please.
-What's going on here?
A woman should have the kind of wardrobe that makes her feel successful, alluring and irresistible.
The mink coat will arrive tomorrow.
Mink coat?
Where did you get the money for all this?
Chapter three: '' How to Open a Charge Account.
'' Well, l want you to forget this subversive literature.
All those boxes go straight back to the store.
l don't know how you think l'll have the money to spend on this kind of thing.
Jeannie, l just can't afford this.
Jeannie.
-You are pleased?
-Pleased?
You're beautiful.
l may keep the gown?
ls it very expensive?
lnsanely.
You may keep the insanely.
-And the slippers?
-And the slippers.
And the perfume?
And the perfume.
Thou art all heart.
You didn't learn that from reading any magazine.
-You hungry?
-Famished.
-What will we have?
-Champagne.
Caviar.
Filet mignon.
-What next?
-Oriental.
Fresh asparagus?
-Baked Alaskan.
-Yes.
Napoleon brandy with the coffee?
-Well?
-Well, what?
-Aren't you gonna conjure it up?
-Nay, master.
No more of those silly little tricks.
From now on, you will do the conjuring with the credit card.
Why don't l order for both of us.
We'll have two filet mignons.
We will have fish.
-Don't you like steak?
-Lesson two: ''You must be independent, self-reliant, unpredictable without seeming obvious.
'' We'll have two fillets of sole.
May l suggest a white wine with the fish?
-A nice Chablis?
-Yes, yes.
That'll be fine.
l will have champagne.
-Lesson number three?
-No, five: ''An expensive woman is a popular woman.
'' -Champagne, please.
-Very good.
Jeannie, l think it's very nice that you want to learn more about modern American women, but a little knowledge can be dangerous.
Do you realize, master that this is the first time you have ever taken me out?
l want it to be a memorable occasion.
l'll remember it all right.
l'll remember how beautiful you look.
Well, that is because l am having such a wonderful time.
Good.
l have not enjoyed myself so much since the night my master, the sultan Harun al-Rashid entertained the great Marco Polo.
-You really met Marco Polo?
-lndeed, yes.
We used to hunt wild boar together.
-What was he like?
-Oh, he was a wild bore.
Are you sure you need this?
Oh, yes, yes.
Pour, please.
For your pleasure, the Tail of the Peacock is happy to present a program of authentic harem dance.
l used to do those dances at parties for the sultan.
Performed by the distinguished artiste Sadelia!
ln my day, she would be flung to the crocodiles.
Jeannie, please.
She has never been a harem dancer.
That girl is an impostor!
Jeannie, please.
She is not fit to dance for an audience of camel drivers.
Be quiet, Jeannie, please.
l'll show you how the dance should be done.
All right, lady.
Now we are going home.
She calls that harem dancing?
-l know, l know, l know.
We're going.
-Not before you paid your bill.
Sorry about that.
Sorry about that.
Sixty-four dollars!
-That includes the amusement tax.
-We were not amused.
Neither were we, mademoiselle.
She moves as gracefully as a dog scratching fleas.
-She is my wife.
-Sorry about that.
Here, keep the change.
Come on.
That's the funniest thing l ever saw.
That poor girl.
l am pleased that it amused you, master.
Where are we going tomorrow night?
Nowhere.
But there are 1 7 more lessons that l have not tried out yet.
Well, forget it.
l don't think they had you in mind when they wrote that magazine article, Jeannie.
But l want to be a typical woman.
Well, woman, maybe.
Typical, never.
A woman, maybe?
l have been practicing for over 2000 years.
You just better keep practicing, young lady because a woman doesn't act the way you did tonight.
But your behaviour this evening was absolutely disgraceful.
Let me tell you one more thing-- You still have a lot to learn!
Jeannie, l'm ready for breakfast.
Hey, how about conjuring up some bacon and eggs?
Now, Jeannie, come on.
You might have waited breakfast.
Let's see.
'' Demonstrator wanted.
No experience necessary.
Sam's Discount Centre.
'' -Good morning.
-Allah be with you.
Ladies, gaze upon the ultimate in kitchen wonders the Miracle Oven.
-Well, what about it?
-What about it?
Well, its wonders include an automatic timer electric clock, stainless steel counter built-in meat thermometer an all-new, built-in Roasterama interior.
Whatever that is.
lt's just like all the others.
Come on, Pauline, let's try the shop across the street.
Please, wait!
lf you do not fork over, l will not have a commission.
Oh, believe me.
Believe me, this Miracle Oven is truly magical.
For instance?
Well it will cook whatever you desire -instantly.
-lnstantly?
l will demonstrate.
-lt is done.
-l don't believe it.
l will show you.
Did you see what l saw, Pauline?
l think so, Frances.
l think l'll buy one.
You wouldn't like it.
Now, really, ladies-- When you get home, it won't work.
Miss!
Miss, l'd like to see it bake a cake.
Yeah!
All right.
-What kind of a cake do you desire?
-Devil's food.
-Food of a devil?
-Well, chocolate cake.
With coconut icing.
Here you are.
That's fantastic.
-Do you know what it is?
-Sure.
lt's a fraud.
She's a phony!
Pardon me, ladies.
Pardon me, ladies.
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
Ladies, will you please don't be excited?
lt's just some little misunderstanding, l'm sure.
l was just pitching a demo, so they would fork over a commission.
That discount store across the street sent you here to make trouble.
-No!
-Yeah, let's go.
-She's not going anywhere.
-Yes, she is.
Don't let her get away!
You can't do that!
Jeannie.
You've been in there all evening.
Now, come on out.
Jeannie, there's no reason to be unhappy.
lt could have happened to anyone.
lt could not have happened to a modern woman.
You were right.
l'm a failure as a woman.
You are not.
You're everything a man could want.
You're-- You're warm and considerate.
-Affectionate.
-Oh, master.
You need an outlet for all that affection.
That is what l've been trying to tell you.
-And l have the answer.
-Yes?
-You need a pet.
-A pet?
Yeah.
You know, like a dog or a cat or a parakeet.
-Did you ever own a pet back there?
-Oh, yes.
Once.
His name was Sim.
The sultan gave him to me.
Good.
Well, first thing tomorrow morning you run down to the pet shop and get one just like him.
Or better yet, why don't you fetch old Sim here.
Master, thou art brilliant.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Hi there, Jeannie.
l thought you were still asleep.
l was gonna leave a note for you.
Here.
That will explain everything, okay?
'' Dear Jeannie, l saw no reason to disturb you.
l am going''-- Going away on a business trip?
!
'' Be a good genie.
We'll see you in 1 0 day''-- Master, you must not go on this journey without me.
You do not know what trouble you will get into.
-Please, let me out of here, master.
-Jeannie.
Now, come on.
Come on, Jeannie.
Now stop that.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
l think you're trying to tell me something.
And l think l better listen.
You and l had better have a talk.
You are headed for disaster.
You were leaving without me.
l explained everything in my note.
l was on my way to a-- -To a military mission.
-Where?
To a city called Hollywood, in a place called California -where they make moving pictures.
-Why must you go?
Because NASA has assigned me as a technical director for an astronaut movie that Mammoth Studios is going to make.
You mean astronauts are going to be in these moving pictures?
Yeah.
That's right.
Well, actually, it stars Rita Mitchell.
Rita Mitchell has had six husbands and is looking for her seventh.
Oh, you are going to need all the help l can give you.
Say, that's a cute outfit.
-Where do you think you're going?
-l am going with thee.
l have never seen pictures that move or a Rita Mitchell.
Well, it's really nothing much to see.
Besides, you've got your studying to do, young lady.
And that's important.
You got 2000 years to catch up on.
Have you done your homework?
There are so many things in your papers and books -that l do not understand.
-Well, just take-- Take the red crayon and circle all the things you don't understand and l'll explain it all-- Explain everything to you.
Why can l not make red circles in Hollywood?
Come on.
-Yes?
-Your car is here, captain.
Can l get your bags?
No, no, l'll take care of my own bags.
-l'll see you in a moment, sergeant.
-Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Now, Jeannie.
Now-- Hey, hey, hey, l got a good idea.
A very, very good idea.
Look, l'm gonna-- l'm gonna put my name on this envelope.
And l'm gonna give you the address of my hotel in Hollywood, California and anything you don't understand, you just mail to me and l will explain to you by return mail.
See?
As you wish, master.
l hope your journey gives you much pleasure.
There are no pleasures involved in this.
This is a military assignment direct from Washington, D.C. Now, you be a good girl.
Oh, l am going to be a very good girl.
Thanks, Jeannie.
Write often.
Thank you.
Here you are.
Thanks.
Rita Mitchell, huh?
-Captain Nelson?
A letter for you, sir.
-Oh, thanks.
Rita, or should l say, Miss Mitchell as your technical advisor l want you to know that no sacrifice is too great.
Master, what is Medicare?
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
Don't tell me.
l know.
l know.
You couldn't finish the article until you knew what a Medicare was.
Thou art so clever.
Oh, God!
lf there's anything l can't stand, it's a smart-aleck genie.
lf l was so clever, l'd never have opened your bottle on that beach.
Art thou really sorry?
No, l guess not.
l've grown accustomed to your smoke.
So that is Rita Mitchell.
She is beautiful.
'' Rita Mitchell's six husbands.
Who will be number seven?
'' Yes?
Yes, this is Captain Nelson here.
Hello, Mr. Tracy.
Stage 1 2-A.
Right, l-- l can leave right away.
Right.
Thank you.
That's the producer.
He's waiting at the studio.
-What will l do with you?
-Take me with you.
As what, a harem dancer?
This is business.
Meet thy new secretary.
l'm putting my foot down.
You are not gonna leave this room.
-l can't have you-- -We are late, master.
Pardon me, l'm Captain Nelson.
l have an appointment with Mr. Tracy.
Oh, yes, captain.
Mr. Tracy is waiting for you on stage 1 2-A.
You'll find it down this way.
To the left.
Thank you.
Charlie l want you to make Rita Mitchell's space suit look like a bikini.
Remember, the male eyes of America expect to see her that way.
Well, Captain Nelson.
l see it didn't take you long to get here.
l-- l-- l can't tell you how glad l am to see you.
Thank you very much.
This is my secretary, Miss Jeannie.
-And what is your first name, my dear?
-Jeannie.
Oh, Jeannie Jeannie.
We haven't had one of those around here since Simone Simon.
Now, our picture deals with an American astronaut named Thompson who finds himself in a rather interesting predicament in as much as it has become necessary to reduce him -to the size of a pinhead.
-The size of a pinhead?
You see, captain by reducing this little astronaut it is now possible to inject him into the body of a Russian astronaut.
Say, about the size of you.
Now, here we have an enlargement of the astronaut.
Oh, he's cute.
Once inside the Russian astronaut the tiny American works his way slowly but torturously through bone and marrow into his very brain.
Even l cannot do that.
l bet you could.
She's got a sense of humour, huh?
Oh, yes.
Yes, she's a million laughs.
What does he do-- The little astronaut.
--once he gets inside there?
-l hope he does not sneeze.
-Not a bad idea.
On second thought, negative.
lt might scatter the information he's obtained.
Now-- Now we have the little astronaut inside the big astronaut and he has obtained information vital and necessary to the defence of our country.
-Any questions?
-Yes.
How does the little astronaut get out?
Good question.
How does he get out?
l'd better track down that writer of ours, wherever he is.
l want you to know that we have put the best story minds in Hollywood on this.
And we have spared no expense in casting.
We've done our part.
Now you must do your part.
And what's that, sir?
Keep this picture believable.
Miss Mitchell, ready on the set, please.
l want you to meet our lovely astronaut, Miss Rita Mitchell.
Ready, Miss Mitchell.
Rita, darling, l want you to meet our technical advisor the famous Captain Tony Thompson.
-Nelson.
-Oh, well, l'm impressed.
Henry, l never thought l'd get to meet a real live astronaut.
Well, l never thought l'd get to meet a real, live Rita Mitchell.
l'm giving a little cocktail party tonight in your honour at my house.
-Shall we say 7:00?
-Oh, 7:00 will be fine.
Good.
Well, and of course, you're invited too.
Well, thank you.
lt will be a welcome change from staying home alone with my bottle.
-They're ready for you, Miss Mitchell.
-Oh, yes.
Oh, there you are, darling.
Come in.
l am sorry we are late, but Captain Nelson had much dictating to do.
Oh, well, we're going to make him forget all of-- Come say hi to.
l'm three olives ahead of you.
This is Captain Nelson's secretary.
And l think maybe l'm in the wrong business.
Maybe you're in the wrong business.
lsn't she scrumptious?
This is Jeannie Jeannie.
A name worth repeating.
This is Hubie, and this is Chris Daily.
How do you do?
Tell me, how long have you been a secretary?
Since noon.
And where did you study stenography?
Where did l study what?
l've always been fascinated by space.
l'm a scientist at heart.
No kidding?
You don't look like one.
Don't laugh.
l have a master's degree in physics.
Really?
Maybe you're in the wrong business.
Maybe you should think of becoming an astronaut.
Jeannie.
You don't mind if l call you Jeannie, do you?
You know, you ought to think about becoming a movie star like Rita Mitchell.
There aren't many girls like you around.
-How did you know?
-Well, l-- You know, honey, you're my kind of people.
The neck ring fits onto the suit here and the helmet threads onto it.
And the unit is carried by hand.
Do you believe in fate?
Oh, yes.
l do too.
Oh, you and l are gonna make beautiful musicals together.
Let's have a drink on that.
l can't offer you the excitement l'm sure you're used to as an astronaut but l do hope you'll let me show you the real Hollywood.
That sounds exciting enough.
Good, then we'll start with lunch tomorrow in Beverly Hills.
Beverly Hills.
About 1 :00?
Oh, boy!
Jeannie, you cut this out!
l'm not kidding, this time you've gone too far!
Now, just knock it off!
You rained on me.
Go on, deny it.
Deny that you were that rainstorm.
l refuse to answer on the grounds that you might get angry.
Get angry?
l'd like to mail you home.
Your home, not mine.
You are going out again with the woman of many husbands?
Yes, as a matter of fact, l am.
We're gonna have lunch and discuss the picture.
And l don't want you raining in my soup.
Master, if l were a movie star, would you have lunch with me?
Sure.
Sure.
Any time.
l'll see you later.
Goodbye.
Then l will have to become a movie star.
l do not know how, but if it will save him, then l must do it.
May l get down now, please?
Hold it.
Don't move.
You could get hurt up there.
l'll let you down.
l wish you extras would quit playing with our equipment.
-Who are you?
You're not an extra.
-l am looking for Mr. Tracy.
-ls he here?
-Oh, is he expecting you?
Oh, no, l do not think so.
But last night he said l should be a star like Rita Mitchell.
-Just like that, huh?
-Yes.
l would like to be a star by tonight, if it is not too much trouble.
Oh, no, no.
No trouble at all.
You know what she needs?
A screen test.
One screen test coming right up.
-What can you do?
-Do?
l can disappear.
She can disappear.
But not before l get your name and phone number, sweetie.
Well, l can make myself into smoke.
Oh, no, no.
Everybody does that.
-Do you have a scene ready?
-A scene?
A scene.
Lines.
Some dialogue.
Do you know ''The Face on the Barroom Floor''?
No.
But l can recite The RubÃ¡iyat of Omar KhayyÃ¡m.
He would not mind.
He was a friend of mine.
-A friend of yours, huh?
-Oh, yes.
He used to try out all his material on me.
He wrote poetry.
Oh, look.
How lovely.
lt's just like home.
lt is empty.
lsn't she beautiful.
-lsn't she beautiful.
-Say, listen.
Why don't you recite some of your friend's poetry for the test?
lf you so desire.
Action.
The Moving Finger writes And, having writ, moves on Nor all thy Piety nor Wit Can lure it back To cancel half a line Nor all thy Tears wash out A Word of it And when, lik e her, oh, SakÃ­ You shall pass Among the Guests Star-scattered in the Grass And in your joyous errand Reach the spot Where I made One-- Turn down an empty Glass -Who is she?
-l'm sorry, Mr. Huberts.
l didn't know you came back from lunch.
l'll get rid of her.
Get rid of her?
l wanna test her.
Screen test?
Jeannie, they were putting you on.
-Putting me on what?
-l mean, they were teasing you.
You can't walk into a film studio and get a screen test.
l did it for you.
Now l can please you as much as Rita because l'm going to be a big star.
-Yeah, who said so?
-Jason Huberts.
He is a very nice man.
He is going to help me.
He's gonna help you what?
Oh, master.
ls it that you are jealous of him?
No, don't be ridiculous.
Of course l'm not jealous.
l just-- l hate to see a nice genie like you make a fool of yourself, that's all.
He makes a very handsome caliph.
The last time you got involved with a caliph it cost you the best 2000 years of your life.
l wish you would not speak to me as though l were a child.
After all, l'm-- l'm older than you are.
Yeah, on a mere technicality.
Jeannie, l'm just telling these things to you for your own good.
Just stay away from that movie crowd, huh?
l've gotta go and meet Miss Mitchell.
Oh, l was hoping that you would come see my screen test.
Well, l can't.
The whole thing's ridiculous.
-Where is it showing?
-At the studio.
ln Mr. Tracy's projection room.
Well, l have another engagement.
l can't.
This had better be good, Hubie.
You're taking me away from-- Oh, hello, Jeannie.
-You're gonna love this kid, Henry.
-l can't wait.
All right, roll it.
Action.
The rose is pale and lifeless compared to thy ruby lips.
Oh, mighty caliph thine arms have such might, they leave me weak.
The strength cometh from my love.
Hold me.
What is this?
What's the gag?
My desert siren.
When thou look est at me this way it seemeth as though thou wert looking right through me.
All right, cut it.
Cut it.
Who's the droll fellow that thought this little stunt would be amusing?
-You, Hubie?
-Me?
l tell you, she was in that test.
She was brilliant.
lt must have been the cameraman or special effects.
Dragging a busy man away for this nonsense when he's got little astronauts to worry about.
Jeannie, l-- l don't know what happened, but l'm terribly sorry.
Sorry.
Master, what--?
What are you doing here?
l came to see your screen test.
l did not know they could not make pictures of me.
Jeannie.
Here.
lf there's anything l can't stand, it's a crying genie.
You are being kind.
Do-- Do not bother with me.
You will be late for Rita Mitchell.
l cancelled that date.
l promise, l will not rain on you anymore.
You what?
l cancelled that date.
Why?
Well, l was a little worried about you.
Oh, master.
l cannot believe it.
You can't believe what?
l have taken thee away from the biggest movie star in Hollywood.
Well, that's show biz.
Master, what is all this?
Oh, these are footprints of Hollywood movie stars.
There's Clark Gable, Wallace Beery, Eddie Cantor.
Master.
Our visit here was unforgettable too.
Yes, it was.
Then why do we not put our footprints in the cement, huh?
Well, for one thing, you can't do it that way.
The cement would have to be soft.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, master.
l am ready.
-Oh, yes?
Ready for what?
-To go for a ride with you in the magic cart that goes like the wind.
Well, it's not a cart.
lt's a car.
A car.
l'm afraid l can't take you out today.
-l'm in the middle of an experiment.
-Oh, you always say that.
Well, l always am.
l know.
You want me to ask you what this experiment is about.
Do you really wanna know?
lf it pleases thee to tell me.
l'm working on a small, portable desalinization unit.
And if it works, it's going to solve one of the most pressing problems in-- Well, in modern history.
The shortage of fresh water.
Very interesting.
When we go riding, may l sit behind the wheel that moves the magic cart?
With this, if you're stranded in the middle of the ocean on an island, say-- Well, like we were.
--you can make all the fresh water you need right out of the ocean.
Let us get stranded again so we can try it out.
-There has to be a way to lick this.
-Oh, nothing could be easier.
You will sit next to me in the magic cart and we will ride very fast.
Wait a minute.
What did you say?
l said, you will sit next to me in the magic cart -and we will ride very-- -No, no.
l mean, about the seawater.
Oh, that.
Great-grandfather Bilejik used to do it all the time.
What magic makes your car move, master?
Forget about the car.
Are you trying to tell me that your great-grandfather -could take salt out of seawater?
-Yes.
At least he used to know how to do it 2000 years ago.
His land was like a Garden of Eden while that of his neighbours all around was like baked clay.
Great-grandfather would not tell them his secret.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, would he tell you his secret?
l suppose so.
ls there some demon inside your car that makes it move?
Oh, forget about the car, really.
l want you to do me a favour.
-l will do anything for you, master.
-Good.
l want you to go back and talk to your great-grandfather.
Have a long talk with him.
l will do anything for you, master.
Except that.
-Why?
-Because l will not leave thee.
But l will do the next best thing.
You sent for Bilejik?
Do you know what it would mean to the rest of the world if we could supply them with usable ocean water?
-Money in it?
-Well, it'd be very valuable.
Oh, then Bilejik is definitely interested.
You know, l was known as the greatest miser in the world.
l was hoping you had changed.
Please be careful, master.
He spent most of his time in jail.
Don't worry about me.
l can handle myself.
Do you have a written formula for this process of yours, sir?
Oh, of course.
l have it all written.
-Right here in a nutshell.
-Would you tell it to me?
Well, we have to have an agreement.
What kind of an agreement?
Believe me, you will not like it, master.
l should have warned you.
He is the black sheep of the family.
You know, l think we could negotiate much better if you get her out of here.
Out.
-Well, l will not leave.
-Jeannie?
Look, why don't you just run along and let the men talk, huh?
-l know him.
He's very cunning.
-Can he do what he says?
-Yes.
But-- -Well, all right, fine.
-We'll get some kind of a deal.
-Well, do we negotiate or do l have to leave?
No, no.
We'll negotiate, sir.
Don't leave.
All right.
But l warned you, master.
Jeannie, why don't you just run along and amuse yourself, huh?
-You mean that?
-Sure.
Thank you, master.
l got rid of her, so we can talk now.
You know-- You know, she is my most favourite great-granddaughter but is honest.
Of course, nobody is perfect.
About this process of yours, sir.
ls it expensive?
Oh, that is the beauty of it.
Pennies.
-How much do you want for it?
-No, no, no!
That is no way to negotiate.
Oh, dear, you.
You spoiled everything.
Let me help you.
When you negotiate you pretend that you are not interested.
Then, perhaps, l will lower my price.
Oh, well.
And would you, sir?
Thou must be kidding.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, no, no, stop.
Now, stop!
No, no, don't do that.
Excuse me, sir.
Just make yourself at home.
l'll be right back.
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, now, l mean it, now-- Now, listen, Jeannie-- Jeannie.
Jeannie.
No.
No, please, wait.
No, no, please, wait.
Wait, now, stop!
l won't have this anymore.
l'm not fooling around.
No, no, please, wait.
Wait!
Now, stop!
No, no.
Please, wait.
Wait!
Wait.
Now, stop.
Wherever you are, stay there.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Captain Nelson, you and l have a lot to talk about.
-Sir?
-That car has no driver.
No.
No, it doesn't.
Well, thank heavens no one was hurt.
Just by talking to it, you brought that vehicle to a stop.
That vehicle should never have started, sir.
l can't wait to hear your explanation.
Well, actually, l can't explain it, sir.
You're doing some experimental work?
You've rigged it up as a robot car, operated by remote control?
-Yes, you might say that.
-Then again, l might not.
l've seen experiments like this, but l've never seen anyone control a car -by talking to it.
-Well, it's new, sir.
lt's top-secret.
That's why it seems so unusual.
Everything about you is unusual, captain.
l haven't had a decent night's sleep since you've been assigned to me.
Sorry about that, sir.
As a psychiatrist, l know that everything has an explanation.
And that includes you and this car.
One day l'm going to get to the bottom of it.
And do you know something, captain?
That's going to be the happiest day of my life.
-Yes, sir.
-But would you mind in the future, please, drive the old-fashioned way?
Thank you.
All right, young lady.
Dr. Bellows is a very suspicious man, is he not?
He has good reason for being suspicious.
Who said you could take the car and drive without me?
-Well, you did, master.
-l what?
Well, you told me to go amuse myself and this is what amuses me.
-lt is faster than a flying carpet.
-And a lot more dangerous.
You are never to do that again.
Do you understand?
-Yes, master.
-l hope Bilejik is still there.
Oh, l will go see.
Put those back.
Don't--?
Don't you ever knock?
l will not have you injure this one.
He belongs to me.
The last time you summoned me to help someone was 1 500 years ago, and l sold him two pyramids -and the scrolls of the Red Sea.
-Yes.
Well, this one is different.
He is most wise.
ln that case, l will just sell him one pyramid.
You will sell him nothing.
But he wants to buy my-- My water formula.
He-- He is a most eager buyer.
Can you really take salt out of water?
Oh, it is child's play.
Then do it for him.
Oh, he's coming.
My own great-granddaughter.
Bilejik?
Bilejik?
-Excuse me.
l thought l lost you.
-Oh, you did, did you?
Well, you are not going to get rid of me that easily.
Would you mind sitting down in there?
-Yes.
-Thank you.
Morning, Tony.
Wanna hear some great sounds?
l've got this Afro-Latin record that'll really turn you on.
-l'm kind of busy now.
-Nice talking to you.
-l got a visitor.
-You got a v--?
You sly dog.
Maybe she'll dig the music, huh?
Where is she?
No, no, it's not a girl.
lt's a very old man.
Sure he is.
Well, l'll.
l'll keep the mood music.
Captain Roger Healey, this is Mr. Bilejik.
Everybody here dresses so oddly.
Where are you from, Mr. Bilejik?
l am from the old country.
-Really?
Where--?
Whereabouts?
-The old, old country.
Now, what can l sell you?
-Well, what--?
What have you got?
-Everything.
He's kind of an old, old junk man.
What are you buying?
Well, actually, l am selling my friend here a-- l don't think l'll discuss it until l find out if it works.
-Don't buy any old capsules from him.
-Oh, what are they?
l can get you all that you need.
He's a little way out, isn't he?
Bye-bye.
-Oh, thank you.
-My record.
l'll take it.
Goodbye, Rog.
Thanks for dropping in.
-All right, let's get down to business.
-Oh, l'm all ready.
You bet l'm ready.
l was wondering what would you like -in exchange for your process?
-Oh, the process.
Well since you are a great friend of my great-granddaughter l will charge you nothing.
That is-- Well, that's very kind of you, sir.
-Except a little token.
-What kind of token?
Well, it would amuse me if l could.
lf l could have a little statue l have heard people talking about.
-What kind of statue?
-Well, l don't know what the name is but it is a statue of a little lady holding a torch.
-The Statue of Liberty?
-Oh, that's it.
You're being unreasonable.
l can't give you the Statue of Liberty.
lt doesn't belong to me.
No one has ever called Bilejik unreasonable.
What about that thing called the Mint?
The Mint?
l can't give you the Mint.
-Elizabeth Taylor?
-Forget it.
l guess l. l'd better be getting back home.
You are not going anywhere.
Not until my master has the formula he wants.
But he has nothing to trade me for it.
You ought to hear what he's asking.
Let me deal with him, master.
-But, Jeannie-- -l will get you what you wish.
All right.
l'll be out on the patio if you need me.
-Don't give away the country, huh?
-No.
Oh, my dear great-granddaughter, you are wasting your time because you have nothing to offer me.
Your formula means nothing to me.
lt doesn't, eh?
Of course not.
l just wanted to get him out of the room so l could wish you a safe journey home.
Thank you.
-Give my love to the family.
-l will.
Great-grandmother is well?
Yes, she is her same old sour-tempered self.
And Tanya?
Tanya?
-The little belly dancer.
-Oh, that--?
That Tanya?
l think l shall arrange for Great-grandmother to meet her.
No, no, no.
Please, please, do not disturb your poor, old grandmother with all of these little problems.
Well, all right.
When do you want the formula?
Now.
Master?
Yeah?
My great-grandfather has decided to tell you what you wish to know.
Yes, and you must understand that this is just out of the goodness of my heart.
Because we are a very generous people.
However, if you wish to show your gratitude-- Great-grandfather.
All right, all right.
-l will need a few things.
-Yes, sir.
What?
-Salt water.
-Salt water.
-Yes.
Porous cloth.
-Porous cloth.
-Seeds of the geloom.
-Seeds of the geloom?
l know where to find them, master.
They grow near the Nile.
Oh, l will fetch them right away.
You will stay right here and l will fetch them.
No woman ever gives me orders.
ls there anything you would like me to tell Great-grandmother while l'm there?
Tell her l'm fine.
l'll be home as soon as l get finished with this-- This business.
Keep your eye on him, master.
l certainly appreciate this, Mr. Bilejik.
l can't tell you what it would mean to me-- Oh, it's nothing, nothing.
lf you-- lf you wish to-- To do me a little favour, well.
You see, l have a little money scheme and l would like to meet your president.
l have not gone yet.
lf there is anything l detest, it's a sneaky genie.
-Hello, Dr. Bellows.
-l've been thinking about this morning, and l wanted to ask you-- -What have you got there?
-This is drinking water, sir.
Don't you have running water in your home?
Well, of course.
This isn't ordinary water.
lt's seawater.
l should have known.
lf l asked why you're drinking seawater -what would your answer be?
-l'm conducting a little experiment, sir.
Oh, another one, captain?
Have you finished the one with the car?
l finished that.
l won't have to test that again.
So now you're drinking seawater?
Are you sure that cask doesn't contain something else, captain?
l don't understand what you mean.
Some whiskey, perhaps?
Gin?
Vodka?
-l hope you don't think that l'd be-- -Oh, don't l?
l'm not as innocent as l look, captain.
Well, sir, really, it's just plain old ordinary seawater, that's all.
Just-- Now, don't-- Don't drink it.
Colonel, please don't-- -Seawater.
-Seawater.
l'm sorry, sir, l-- l mean, l-- l told you.
-Here's your seawater, sir.
-Oh, good.
Good, good, good.
Thank you.
Oh, tell me, sir, are you a very rich man?
Who, me?
Why, no, no.
Why?
Well, l thought perhaps you could arrange a little loan for me.
-Forget it.
-Here are your geloom seeds.
Oh, may l see those?
l wanna find out the modern name for them.
-lf it works, that is.
-lt had better work.
Oh, poor Bilejik.
He's-- He's caught in a real den of thieves, but it will work.
Now-- Now-- Now we pour the seawater in that.
Do not trouble yourself, master.
Oh, my.
She was always a showoff.
-What happens now?
-Oh, what usually happens is that l get paid, but.
Well, all right.
You'll have fresh water in-- -ln less than a minute.
-How does it work?
Well, you-- You see, the seeds have an incredible affinity for the salt and they soak it up just like sponges.
-You mean, that's all there is to it?
-Oh, no, no.
Usually l make it much more complicated.
As a matter of fact, l did the same experiment a long time ago.
lt took me seven months.
But the sultan paid me a fortune.
Here.
Taste it.
She always was a showoff.
lt's fresh water.
-And it's wonderful.
-Yes, be my guest.
-Bilejik, l don't know how to thank you.
-Thou art telling me?
He has already been thanked, master.
Look at the size of these.
Look how big they are.
Yes.
Well, of course, they're full of salt.
-Where can l get more?
-Oh, it's a weed.
lt grows in fields everywhere, everyplace.
You've done it, Jeannie.
Bilejik, l'm gonna see that your name goes down in history.
Well, who wants that?
There-- There's no money in it.
Can l go home now?
Yes, Great-grandfather.
Have a safe journey home.
And give my love to Tanya.
Look what he had stolen.
You should have let him keep them.
Jeannie, do you have any idea what these seeds mean?
We're gonna go look up a botanist and find out the modern name for these.
Oh, it's incredible.
Why, this is the most exciting find l've ever run across.
-You don't know the half of it.
-Oh, there's no doubt about it.
No, no, this is it.
-You know the name of it?
-l told you the name.
lt is called the geloom seed.
These seeds are the seeds of the Lucretia Quimby daisy.
-We're gonna need a lot of them.
-Well, they grow like weeds.
lt was named for his mother by a man named Quimby in the year 1 87 2.
That was nice of him, wasn't it?
Oh, it goes way back.
Several thousand years back.
Yeah, l know.
l know.
They grow wild in the Middle East.
-Grew.
-Grew?
Yes.
You see Quimby was an archaeologist as well as a botanist.
That's why we have a record of this seed.
And he translated an ancient work on botany.
Gave the whole history of the plant -and the blight.
-The blight?
The blight that wiped out the Lucretia Quimby daisy in the year 1 .
Hi, Jeannie.
What are you doing?
Oh.
l am in the middle of an experiment.
l see.
l'm supposed to ask you what the experiment is, right?
-Do you really want to know?
-Go ahead, tell me.
Drink this.
What is it?
Fresh water.
lt's salt water.
Yes.
l cannot make fresh water out of salt water but l have learned how to make salt water out of fresh water.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Jeannie.
l have enjoyed having you here to visit me.
When you get home, be sure to give my love to the family.
Jeannie.
Have a pleasant journey, and be sure to write.
-Jeannie.
-Oh, good morning, master.
Your breakfast is almost ready.
Never mind about the breakfast.
Who were you talking to?
-No one.
-l heard you.
l heard you.
You know what's gonna happen to me if anybody catches you here.
Now, who were you talking to?
My aunt Fatama.
She's been visiting me here all week.
Oh, but do not worry.
She's returning home today.
How could your aunt Fatama be here all week?
l haven't seen her.
Well, l know.
l did not want her to disturb you, master.
Aunt Fatama is a lovely woman, but she never stops talking.
Yeah.
Well, at least l could've said goodbye to her before she left.
Oh, she has not left yet.
Would you like to say goodbye?
Sure.
Any friend of yours is a friend of mine.
Where is she?
Master, this is Aunt Fatama.
Aunt Fatama, Captain Nelson.
-Jeannie, l'm home.
-l am out here, master.
Boy, you should've seen me in the lab today.
Jeannie!
What are you doing?
Get down off my towel.
What if one of the neighbours sees you?
But, master, you know how restful it is up here.
Yes, yes, yeah, l know.
But come down here.
Come up here.
Take these trunks off.
No, l don't mean-- l mean, what if somebody looked over the wall?
Oh, master, you worry too much.
This patio is private.
Not anymore it isn't.
This is Custer's.
Now you've gotta get out of here.
Custer to Captain Nelson.
-Hi.
-Hi.
My third stage malfunctioned.
Well, that happens to us down at the cape occasionally.
-What went wrong?
-Fuel trouble.
l guess l didn't mix enough vinegar with the baking soda.
Well, you can try another space probe tomorrow, huh?
Gee, l wish l was a real astronaut like you.
They send up monkeys and mice but l don't see what they've got against kids.
That's for me.
l gotta go do my homework.
-Sounds like '' Reveille.
'' -lt was.
But it's the only bugle call Mom knows how to play.
Blast off!
l'm back.
Jeannie, l don't mind you levitating.
l like it myself, but not out here.
But the sun is out here, master.
There.
ls this not more pleasant?
Well, l guess you could consider it part of the space program.
Has anyone see my--?
Crew?
You will wear yourself out, master.
Would you like to float a while?
No, no, not again.
We were seen the last time.
-What does it matter?
-What does it matter?
How am l going to explain it to that kid?
And you-- You know he's gonna ask.
l just hope he hasn't-- Jeannie!
Jeannie.
Kitchen.
Jeannie.
-Good evening.
-Hello, Major Jamison.
l wasn't expecting anybody.
As a matter of fact, l was just going to bed.
At 7:00?
Sorry to bother you, captain, but we need your help.
Well, what can l do for you, sir?
You can help me straighten out my son.
lt's just that Custer's imagination runs away with him.
lt wasn't my imagination.
Weren't you and that lady floating in the air?
Tell them.
See what l mean?
Talk to him.
Hi there, Custer.
Say, you probably know more about space mechanics than any boy your age.
So you of all people should realize that ordinary people just can't float in the air.
-But l saw you.
-Yeah.
lf you can tell me how, under normal circumstances a person can float in the air l'd be willing to admit it.
There's someone in the kitchen.
l'm sorry we intruded, Captain Nelson.
You didn't.
Not at all, sir.
-Didn't you hear that?
-Let's get home, dear.
We've taken up enough of Captain Nelson's time.
Boy, grownups sure have bad ears.
lt sounded like a girl giggling.
Now, thank Captain Nelson for explaining everything to you.
But he didn't.
Well, he did to my satisfaction.
You'll understand when you're older.
Come along.
-Good night, captain.
-Good night.
Good night.
-lf l could help again.
-Not at all.
l like that boy.
One of these days you're gonna go too far.
Oh, have no fear, master.
l will always come back.
Jeannie.
Come on, l've gotta study.
Oh, but why, master?
When you take your test l can be a little voice whispering in your ear.
Like this.
Now, Jeannie, l'm gonna do this on my own.
Please.
Besides, what do you know about celestial navigation?
Oh, l learned a few things in my day.
From Galileo.
Well, l had a feeling he didn't spend all his time gazing at the stars.
Truly!
Some days it does not pay to get out of the bottle.
-And then she disappeared?
-ln smoke?
Let's go back and see Captain Nelson.
-l gotta find out how he does it.
-Custer.
l know.
l'm restricted to barracks.
Nancy, l simply cannot cope with him any longer.
We need professional help for your son.
My son?
You're the one ordered me to have a boy.
Yes, but not this one.
Doctor, it just isn't normal for a kid to keep on fabricating these stories.
Major, l appreciate your problem but there just aren't enough hours in the day of an Air Force psychiatrist as it is.
Who's to say what's normal when it comes to kids?
l'm sure it's merely a phase he's going through.
Well, l wish he'd go through it without stopping on the way to see Tony Nelson float in the air.
Captain Tony Nelson?
Yes.
Custer is always hanging around him.
Why, he worships the ground that astronaut lifts off from.
Of course, if you're too busy.
l'm never too busy to reach down and take a little boy by the hand to guide those stumbling little feet on the path to manhood to make him open up his little psyche and say, ''Ahh.
'' -He's right outside.
-Bring him in.
Custer.
Come in, Custer.
l'm Dr. Bellows.
l just want you to make yourself comfortable.
Now, Custer, tell me exactly what happened in your own words.
Just begin at the beginning.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
How can you hear with that whatchamacallit in your ears?
Custer, Custer.
Thank you.
All right, son.
-How about lying down on the couch?
-l'm not tired.
Well, l just want you to be comfortable while you talk to me.
l'm comfortable here.
Custer to Earth.
l've just completed one-man orbit.
Now, Custer.
No more orbits.
They make me dizzy.
What other games have you got?
Let's talk about the game when you saw Captain Nelson float in the air.
That wasn't a game.
That was real.
You think l'm some sort of schizophrenic?
Must be a secret trick the astronauts have learned.
He might have experienced a weightlessness reaction from a simulated flight.
He must've taught the girl the trick.
Girl?
What girl?
The one he made disappear in a puff of smoke.
Boy, l wish l could do that.
Now, you know that's impossible.
Custer, l believe you.
-You do?
Honest?
-Yes.
l'm your friend, Custer.
And l'm also Captain Nelson's friend.
Anything he does concerns me because it concerns the space program.
Do you understand?
You and l are gonna try to help Captain Nelson.
lt'll be our secret.
Gee, what do you want me to do?
l want you to keep your eyes open and l want you to report to me anything you see that's out of the ordinary.
-l'll do the rest.
-Okay.
-Dr. Bellows?
-Yes, Custer?
Do head shrinkers give lollipops?
You mean to say this is the kind of dancing they do nowadays?
Yeah, something like that.
lt's like our harem dancing.
Yeah, only with more clothes on.
Custer, what are you doing here?
l was on a reconnaissance flight.
Well, purely in the interest of the space program anything peculiar going on?
She's done it again.
She disappeared.
Are you sure she was there?
Really grabs you, huh?
-What's going on here?
-He'll hear us.
Well, it's been years since l've nabbed me a peeping Tom.
l think l hear my mom's bugle.
Officer, you're making a mistake.
l'm a psychiatrist.
Same thing.
First time l've seen a peeping Tom giving on-the-job training.
Officer, if you'll just ring the bell, Captain Nelson will vouch for us.
Don't worry.
l'll do that little thing.
-Jeannie, where are you?
-I am here.
I saw Custer at the window.
Good girl, good girl.
Just stay where you are, wherever that is.
-Yes?
-Sorry to bother you, Captain Nelson.
Caught these two looking in your window.
-You didn't.
-Please tell him who l am.
-Do you know him?
-Yes, officer.
l know this man.
l must admit, l'm shocked by this behaviour.
Well, if you know him, l guess it's okay.
l wouldn't go looking in people's windows after this if l were you.
Thank you very much.
-Anything for you, Captain Nelson.
-Right.
You may have been wondering why we were looking in your window.
l'm gonna get right to the point, Captain Nelson.
There are some things going on around here that scream for an explanation.
-Oh, yes, sir?
-Yes.
l have an eyewitness here who says he saw you dancing a few moments ago with a girl who seems to have vanished.
Yes, yes, she seems to have vanished.
Custer, shouldn't you be in bed?
Why, Captain Nelson.
She was a beautiful blond with long hair.
A blond?
Did you see a blond?
No.
Of course not.
l hate blonds.
Tell me, captain are there some experiments with weightlessness at the base that l haven't been informed about?
He's doing it again.
Dr. Bellows!
Doing what, Custer?
He was just this high off the floor.
ls your mother's bugle broken, Custer?
Come on, captain.
Do it again.
Can you go up in the air any time you want?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
There he goes again, doctor.
Custer, tomorrow we're gonna have your eyes checked.
We'll be running along now.
l'm sorry to have bothered you, captain.
Anytime, Dr. Bellows.
l wish he'd teach me how to float like that.
There he goes again!
Come on, Custer.
You'll feel much better when we get those glasses fitted.
Here we are.
All right, Jeannie, put me down.
Thanks.
Good evening, master.
Jeannie, don't play those little tricks, please.
What tricks?
Thou art so nervous.
lt's just that every time l turn around l expect Custer to pop out.
Well, l can take care of that.
l will not have you tormented.
Well, l'm not so crazy about it myself.
Dr. Bellows thinks l'm coming apart at the seams as it is.
lf you see any loose threads hanging off me, don't pull them.
Oh, master, l'm so pleased.
-Pleased?
-Yes.
Because now you need me, and l can help you.
Oh, l can offer you many solutions to this problem.
All l need is one.
Oh, but it's a simple matter.
-l can turn him into a fro-- -You'll turn him into nothing.
An excellent idea.
No, no.
l mean, leave him alone.
-But, l-- -No buts.
No buts.
l'll handle this my way, do you hear?
Oh, but, master-- Yes, master.
Yeah.
Nelson here.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Jamison.
Yeah?
No, no.
Custer hasn't been around here all day.
He-- Well, you know how boys are.
Yeah.
Sure, sure.
lf l see him, l'll give you a ring.
Okay.
Okay, bye.
Custer has disappeared.
Custer has disappeared.
Custer has disappeared!
Custer has disappeared!
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
You come out of there.
Yes, master.
Don't you ''yes, master'' me.
What have you done with Custer?
l have not done anything with Custer.
Don't give me that.
He's been missing since early morning.
Well, l do not have him.
l didn't say you had him.
l asked what you've done with him.
-You are yelling at me.
-You haven't heard me yell yet.
You were gonna turn him into nothing.
Well, l did not do that.
Custer will turn up.
Yeah, but what as?
A pollywog or a parakeet?
Or something really sensational, like a rutabaga?
You do not believe me.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
A little kid like that who never did you any harm.
Jeannie, come back.
Bring Custer back.
This is your master calling!
l'm sure he's all right, honey.
After all, no rockets left for Mars today.
l was only fooling, dear.
Honestly.
-Here, Nancy.
Take this.
-No, no.
Thanks for coming over, doctor.
You've been a great comfort.
That could be some news.
Oh, Custer, Custer, darling.
ls he back yet?
ls there--?
ls there anything new in the house?
-What?
-Well-- Hello, Dr. Bellows.
l mean, since Custer left have you noticed anything that wasn't here before?
-That's new.
-Where'd it come from?
l found it in Custer's room this morning.
On his bed, next to his pyjamas.
Water it every day.
He's a growing boy.
There's a new goldfish.
Does that count?
Does it count?
-Which one?
Which one?
-lt's the one with the brown eyes.
Custer.
Custer.
Captain, l know how upset you must be over Custer.
Sir, l have a confession to make.
Tell me, captain.
Unburden yourself.
This is all my fault.
l can't keep it a secret any longer.
-Your fault?
-lt's liable to finish me but l've got to tell you.
Yes, yes?
l know what happened to Custer.
l have this friend, and she thought Custer-- Hi.
Custer, darling.
Where have you been?
There's this carnival at the edge of town.
They've got the neatest centrifuge ride.
l didn't think you'd mind.
You've been at the carnival all day?
l was gonna call you and tell you where l was only l wouldn't have had money for popcorn.
And, hey, Captain Nelson, l know how you do that floating trick.
-What do you mean?
-l saw a lady at the carnival do the exact same thing.
Even disappeared in a puff of smoke.
What did she look like, huh?
Big fat lady with dark hair.
Oh, l'm so relieved.
Captain Nelson, let's have coffee and coffeecake.
No, l'm sorry, Mrs. Jamison.
l've gotta find somebody and apologize to her.
How about that confession?
Yeah, well, how about that?
Now, Custer, my boy, let's start at the beginning and go over everything you saw very carefully.
Jeannie.
Look, how wrong can a fellow be?
l hope you'll forgive me but l won't blame you if you don't.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Hey, Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Hi.
Oh, Jeannie, how wrong can a fellow be?
l won't blame you if you don't forgive me.
l hope you will.
Never.
Do not bother me.
l am choosing a new planet.
l will not stay where l am not wanted.
Who said that, huh?
Who said that?
Who said you weren't wanted?
l will find a master up there who does not hate blonds.
Jeannie, l didn't mean that.
You know, we have a custom on this planet called '' kiss and make up.
'' l would know more of this custom.
l am truly sorry.
l'll never accuse you of anything like that again.
You promise?
l promise.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Master, would you like some more coffee?
Sugar?
Master, is that newspaper more entertaining than l am?
No, no.
Don't be silly, Jeannie.
Well, you hide behind it and never even notice me.
l do not know why you bothered rescuing me from that bottle on the island.
For all you care, l could be a lamp or a vase or.
Of course l notice you.
As a matter of fact, l noticed you were wearing a new shade of lipstick this morning.
Very becoming.
You look beautiful.
Oh, hey, l gotta get moving.
l gotta be in the centrifuge earlier this morning.
Have a good day.
Jeannie.
Look, l'm-- l'm sorry l didn't notice you were a chimpanzee.
l'm just something you order in and out of a bottle.
Oh, no, that's not true.
You're a warm, wonderful woman.
You're everything a man could possibly-- Back in the bottle.
No, no, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean it exactly that way.
Jeannie, now, come on.
Look, l. Do me a favour, don't ever translate that.
-Diane.
-Tony Bunny.
-''Tony Bunny?
'' -Darling, it's been so long.
Well, it must have been two years.
Two years, one month, and 1 0 days, Tony Bunny.
-When did you get into town?
-Why, just 1 0 minutes ago.
l borrowed Papa's plane and flew in.
And now l'm really ready to fly.
Well, yes.
Say, we really kicked it around in Fort Worth, didn't we?
Oh, well, it's a nice city, all right.
We didn't-- l wouldn't say we exactly kicked it around.
Sure, l remember Fort Worth.
We had a wonderful time, didn't we?
Yeah.
Those lovely warm days and nights.
Well, sit down, Diane.
Honey, you're nervous.
Say, you're not married or anything silly like that, are you?
Oh, no.
Nothing silly like that.
l've gotta get that chair fixed.
l don't want that to happen again.
-How long are you gonna be in town?
-Just a couple of days.
l've got to liquidate some stock holdings for Papa.
l guess we won't have too much time together.
We don't need too much time, do we, lover?
What is it you used to say?
That we could crowd a whole hour into just a couple of seconds.
Oh, did l say that?
This is wonderful for relaxation, once you get the hang of it.
-You sure act married.
-Well, l'm not.
l have every right to live my own life.
-How about 8:00?
-Seven?
All right, tell you what.
Why don't you meet me here for cocktails.
lt'll be Fort Worth all over again.
And maybe we'll throw in a little Dallas and Houston too.
-Bye.
-Bye.
Tony Bunny.
l'm sorry, Diane.
l'm sorry.
l really am.
Seven o'clock?
-Six-thirty.
-Six-thirty.
Go now.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, where are you?
Jeannie.
-l'm here, master.
-What do you think you were doing?
Well, l have a right to protect what is yours.
-What's that?
-Me.
lt just so happens that l'm a very good friend of her family.
Her brothers and l were best buddies when l was stationed in Texas.
Diane was just one of the boys.
She does not look like one of the boys.
Well, you're just going to have to accept that-- That l'm doing this for her family.
lt's a good deed.
l'll see you later.
Goodbye.
Dr. Bellows.
Oh, yes, general.
Right, sir.
l'm in the lab section making out the results of the pressure chamber tests now.
What did you mean, you were doing it for her family?
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
Well, l would like to know more about this girl.
There will be four reports.
Fennady, Davis, Henderson and a girl in a harem costume.
Nothing, general.
l'll have the reports on your desk this afternoon.
Goodbye, sir.
These are ready for your signature, sir.
What?
Oh, yes.
Never mind about Diane.
What if somebody catches you in that outfit?
l couldn't explain you in a million years.
Then you are going out with this girl tonight?
You bet l am.
l don't want to discuss it anymore.
l shall turn her into a pillar of salt.
You do and l'll pour ink in your bottle.
Smoke yourself home, will you?
You idiot.
Where do you think you're going?
l have seen some stupid driving in my time but l have never seen such a beautiful girl in my life.
l'm so sorry.
l must've ruined your car.
Oh, it was-- lt was nothing.
l'll get another one.
But l have broken the eye that shines in front.
-l'll say.
How about dinner tonight?
-l could not have dinner.
But l should do something about your car.
Do something about me.
How about dinner?
You are very persistent.
Also very lovable.
How about dinner?
But l do not know anything about you.
What is there to know?
l'm an emotionally healthy astronaut.
An astronaut?
Of course.
You're a friend of-- A friend of whose?
Never mind.
l will have dinner with you tonight.
-Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
-Good morning.
Captain, l've had a rather traumatic little experience which you may be able to clarify for me.
-Me, sir?
-Yes, you.
When you drove up this morning, you were alone.
But when l looked again there was a girl with you.
-A girl?
-Yes.
A girl in a harem costume.
A girl in a harem costume?
Well, at least, l thought she was in a harem costume.
And then l looked a second time and she was in a dress.
Doctor you have a problem.
Yes.
Of course, l know there was no girl.
That was my subconscious playing tricks.
But a harem costume.
l'll have to work this out.
Naturally, this will remain strictly between us.
Thank you, captain.
And a big, beautiful good morning to you, colonel.
ls it?
Man, oh, man, did l just meet a girl.
l know.
And you're in love again.
Oh, no, no.
l'm serious this time.
This girl is different.
She's sensitive, and she's shy and l don't know how to handle her.
Look, maybe you can give me some advice, huh?
Well, sure.
Sure.
Well, for one thing, with a shy girl, you gotta have a positive approach.
You have to have a battle plan.
What would you suggest?
Let's see.
A, the softening-up process.
A liberal amount of champagne.
And B, the pincer movement.
Get her up to your apartment to listen to your records.
-And C, the-- -All-out attack.
No.
No.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Kind of girl you described, that'd ruin everything.
No, you've got to draw her out.
Get her talking about herself.
Get simpatico.
And then, we'll-- And then she falls into my lap like a ripe plum.
l've got a date tonight.
l'd like to meet this girl.
Say we meet for cocktails?
l'll give you 1 0 minutes with her, no more.
And what does that mean?
Anyone who can give expert advice like that can't be trusted.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
-Yes, master.
-Oh, l'm gonna be leaving now.
There's supposed to be a good late show on television, and l was-- Hey.
-What you all dressed up for?
-l have a date.
-With a man?
-They make the best dates.
Well-- Well, who is he?
Where did you meet him?
Oh, l did not meet him.
l bumped into him.
And like that, you made a date with him?
A man you don't know anything about?
lf you are jealous and do not wish me to go.
No, no.
No.
Go.
You have every right to go out.
Have a wonderful time.
-What's his name?
-l forgot to ask him.
You don't even know his name?
Oh, well, master, l'm a grown woman.
What is there to worry about?
Grown men.
l see you don't have any experience with the American male.
l'll have to have a talk with him when he picks you up.
l am meeting him at the public library.
He's not coming here?
What's he trying to hide?
Well, if you would rather l do not go, l will not go-- No, no.
Go, go.
lt's your life.
You made the date.
Go.
Well goodbye then.
Goodbye.
-l am going.
-Yeah, l know.
-Good night then.
-Good night.
Unless you would rather l do not go, and then l won't.
Oh, no.
Go.
Go.
She went.
Jeannie-- Hi.
Hello?
Hello, Roger.
l haven't got time to talk.
l've got to go after a friend.
l thought we were gonna meet and have a couple of drinks.
I'll meet her some other time.
My friend's in real trouble.
Never mind.
She just came back.
Hello, lover.
Ready to rock the town?
Now, l'll bet you got big plans for tonight.
-Where do we go first?
-Public library.
May l help you?
No, thanks.
We're just looking.
Tony, l think you've been in orbit too long.
Well, first you drag me to the public library and you don't even take out a book.
And this is the fourth nightclub we've been to.
Don't you like our nightclubs, Diane?
l wouldn't know.
We haven't stopped in one long enough to have a drink.
-There's a friend l'd like you to meet.
-That's progress.
So far all l've met are four doormen and a head librarian.
-Roge.
-Tony.
This is Diane Rodney.
Captain Roger Healey.
Diane.
Would you like to join us?
-We'd love-- -No, thanks.
We've got to run.
Do you ever sit down long enough to make a friend?
Diane, sit down.
l'll be right back.
Pardon me.
Jeannie.
Master, darling, what are you doing here?
Oh, l just dropped in for a drink.
While l'm here, might as well drive you home.
l do not think my date would like that.
l don't care whether he likes it or not.
Jeannie, l don't think you realize the trouble you can get into staying out late with a man you don't know.
This man could be dangerous.
He could be some kind of a nut.
He could be Roger.
Roge--?
Roger--?
Roger's your date?
You two know each other?
Yes.
Yes.
We've met.
Oh, Diane, this is Jeannie.
Any friend of Tony Bunny's is a friend of mine.
-This is the girl?
-This is the one.
-Gorgeous, isn't she?
-Sugar?
-lsn't she something else?
-Yeah, she sure is.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
The coffee may be too hot.
lt is just right.
Don't wake me up.
l am sure that you would notice if you were eating breakfast with a chimpanzee.
Not if he was reading a newspaper.
The thing that l like about this conversation is that l don't know what anybody's talking about.
What she's trying to say is she adores me.
She's been doing things for me all night.
When l sat, l was hitting a draft, and she sat there herself.
Where did you say that you found her?
-Diane, would you like to dance?
-Oh, l thought you'd never ask.
Roge, would you dance with her, please?
-Oh, sure.
-Oh, wait.
Your shoes.
When l came in she took off my shoes so l'd be comfortable.
Yeah, hard to believe.
You sit down there.
Have a little champagne.
You drink up there, bubbly, bubbly and l'll be right back.
Jeannie.
-What are you trying to prove?
-You said to go, so l went.
But not with my best friend.
You are jealous.
Well, of course l'm not jealous.
l just don't like to see you make a fool of yourself, that's all.
Taking his shoes off, putting his shoes on-- -Well, l do that for you.
-Well, that's different.
Now stop gulping down the champagne and go home.
Are you asking me as my master or as a jealous Tony Bunny?
-Neither.
-Well, then l will not go home.
Well-- The next dance is yours, Reluctant Dragon.
l don't think we ought to leave them alone.
Give me one good reason.
You two go ahead.
We're gonna be running along.
-Running along where?
-The old battle plan.
What old battle plan?
Captain Healey invited me to listen to his record collection.
We're gonna have a nice, long talk.
Simpatico.
How about that?
l want to have a nice, long talk with you.
Not in the middle of a battle.
-Nice meeting you.
-Wait a minute.
Do not worry, master.
l'll report everything that happens.
Thank you.
Jeannie.
Well, welcome to Casa Healey.
The house of beautiful music, fine wines and a lonely bachelor, until tonight.
Oh, it is very lovely.
ls something the matter?
Oh, it is my head.
l think l've had too much champagne.
Oh, you've come to the right place.
Old Doc Healey has just the cure for headaches.
Oh, you are a doctor?
We have a nice, comfortable sofa and no glaring lights.
That's very important.
Excuse me.
No glaring light.
Got the lights off.
And we have here soft music.
Now, how's that?
lt is very nice.
Just leave it up to the old doc.
Must be a short.
Little lights.
Get that right away.
Right away.
Pardon me.
There we go.
Now, back to that nasty, old headache.
Shoulder right over there.
Relax.
Close your eyes.
Just feel the mood of the music.
l don't even have that record in my collection.
l think my headache is gone.
Now l've got one.
Well, here's your chance to help me just as l was going to help you.
The whole electric system seems to be going crazy here.
l'll be fixing that.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Roge.
Roge.
Open up.
Roger.
Roger.
Roger, open up.
Roge.
Good morning, Roge.
Tony, what are you doing here?
l want to borrow your slide rule.
A slide rule at 2:00 in the morning?
Yeah, l got a little work l want to finish.
You want to borrow my slide rule at 2:00 in the morning.
Oh, what a-- What a crazy night this has been.
-First, Jeannie runs out on me-- -Jeannie runs out on you?
Yeah, l didn't even get to plan C. Oh, well, l-- l'm sorry about that, Roge.
Better luck next time.
What next time?
l don't even know where she lives.
Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.
-Do you know where she lives?
-l'm sorry.
Well, l gotta find out.
l'm crazy about her.
Did she ever give you her number?
No.
Now, come to think of it, she may have.
The party where l met her she was handing it out to everybody.
-Her phone number?
-Oh, you can't blame her.
A plain girl like that, she has to do everything she can to get a date.
Plain girl?
You must have retarded retinas.
She was gorgeous.
lf she was so gorgeous, how could you get a date with her like that?
Well, l'm pretty gorgeous myself.
You see what she did for me?
She couldn't do enough for me.
Treated me like l was a king.
Well, a guy gets pretty tired of a woman fawning all over him.
-What's wrong with a little attention?
-Attention?
A girl who feels your coffee cup on your first date.
-That's bad?
-Today, it's your coffee cup.
Tomorrow, it's your whole life.
Yeah.
l could see how she would get to be a little possessive.
Not only that, you're gonna lose all your married friends.
-All my married friends?
-Yeah.
Well, the wives will hate Jeannie.
Oh, they'll see her catering to you, treating you with kindness and understanding, compassion.
You think they're gonna sit idly by and let her destroy everything they stand for?
-l see l can lose the wives.
-Well, no doubt about that.
Well, maybe she did go a little too far when she took off my shoes.
Roge, the last thing l want to do is talk you out of a girl you're crazy about.
lf she was so great, how come l was able to get a date with her like that?
-l don't want to spoil anything for you.
-There's nothing to spoil.
She overstepped herself when she tipped the doorman who helped me into the cab.
Our friendship's the only thing that counts.
l don't know how to thank you, Tony.
lf you hadn't talked to me l might have made a terrible fool out of myself.
Take it easy, Roge.
Tony, you-- You forgot your slide rule.
What?
At 2:00 in the morning?
-Good evening, master.
-Oh, hello, Jeannie.
You're back.
Thought you'd still be out with Captain Healey.
Oh, l left him.
You were not worried about me?
No, no.
Not a bit.
l said to myself: '' lf Jeannie can't take care of herself, who can?
'' l thought you might at least go up to Captain Healey's apartment to see if l was all right.
No, no.
No, never occurred to me.
Now who could that be at 2:30 in the morning?
Oh, Jeannie, do you mind?
Thanks.
-Roger, what are you doing here?
-l couldn't sleep, Tony.
l figured if you needed a slide rule at 2:00 in the morning you must be working on something pretty important.
Thanks.
You really didn't have to bother.
Thanks a lot.
Thanks.
Oh, master, you did go to Captain Healey's apartment.
Well, only for a minute.
Oh, you were worried about me.
A little bit.
-There's one thing you gotta remember.
-What is that?
l'm only human.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Oh, boy.
Uh, Jeannie.
Jeannie, bedtime.
Bottle time.
You're going to bed so early, master?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, l got a rough day tomorrow.
Those Russian cosmonauts are coming in.
Have a good sleep, master.
l am going out.
-You're going out?
Where?
-l have a date.
Captain Healey is going to pick me up in front of the public library.
Now, wait a minute.
We've been all through this before.
You can't go out with Captain Healey.
He's turned in his wolf suit.
He wants to marry you.
-l know.
-Yeah, well, he can't.
Why not?
l am single.
Yeah, well, you've been single for 2000 years.
Well, that is just it.
-l do not wish to be an old maid.
-All right, look, Jeannie.
l can't let you do this to my best friend.
He's only read Omar Khayyam.
You used to sit in his tent and drink wine with him.
Well, l would not be going out with your best friend if l was married to his best friend.
Yes.
Jeannie, we've been through that too.
There would be many advantages to being married to me, master.
For instance: What?
What?
What are you trying to prove?
Yes.
Well, this is the biggest advantage of all.
When you are old, l'll still look like this and you won't have to chase young girls.
All right, Jeannie.
l'm aware of the fringe benefits.
-But l'm not ready to get married yet.
-Oh, very well.
l have waited for 2000 years.
l suppose l can wait a while longer.
Well, sure you can.
Meantime, you won't go out with Captain Healey?
lf it will make you happy.
And if you promise not to go out with other girls.
Right.
No other girls?
l'm a bachelor.
Of course l'll go-- -Goodbye, master.
-You got a deal.
ln that case.
Good night, master.
Even if l did marry her, how would l ever get in that bottle?
-The general will be right with you.
-Thank you, sergeant.
Tony, you've got to help me find Jeannie.
She vanished into thin air again.
-Well, l don't know what l can do, Roge.
-l see her once and she disappears.
A woman just can't vanish into a puff of smoke.
Roger, with women, logic will get you nowhere.
Well, l'll tell you, l gotta find her.
l'm going crazy.
You see this.
Look at that.
lsn't that--?
Hey, that's a lot of carats.
l was gonna put it on her finger last night, but what does she do?
Stands me up in front of the public library.
Well, if you want my advice, forget her.
l don't want your advice.
l want Jeannie.
Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning, sir.
-General.
The Russian cosmonauts are with Dr. Bellows now.
They'll join us in a moment.
The State Department has invited Majors Posnovsky and Tiomkin here as a gesture of good will.
They'll be staying at my hotel for two days.
You will be their hosts and entertain them.
What type of entertainment would you suggest, sir?
Their stay will be brief but we'd like them to leave impressed with the flavour and the majesty of our great country.
So keep them away from the Watusi festival and the strip joints.
Good morning, gentlemen.
-Good morning, sir.
-Colonel.
Captain Nelson, Captain Healey, Major Tiomkin and Major Posnovsky.
How do you do?
-Thank you.
-Captains Healey and Nelson will do everything to make your stay pleasant.
Captain Healey, you'll be in charge of Major Posnovsky.
Captain Nelson, Major Tiomkin.
-My pleasure, major.
-Mine too.
l think it's about time for our tour around the base, right, Dr. Bellows?
The photographers are waiting outside.
Right this way.
The press has been swarming for an interview with you cosmonauts.
Captain, l am very direct person.
From moment l see you, l say, ''This cat is for me.
'' Cat?
Oh, yes.
Well-- Major Tiomkin, l-- Sonya, big daddy.
l'm sorry l have to leave you alone tonight, Jeannie.
Oh, l understand.
You have this Major Tiomkin to take care of.
Yes.
Yes, l certainly do.
l would only be in the way.
You-- You might, yeah.
We'll probably spend the evening discussing aerodynamics and playing chess.
Well, l will stay home and watch television.
lt is more fun than a flying carpet.
Good, good.
Well, off to an evening of chess.
-Master.
-Yeah?
What does this Major Tiomkin look like?
Oh, you know, all eyebrows, heavyset.
Average Russian.
-Something like this?
-Yeah.
Well, yes.
He has a little more hair than that.
Well, he doesn't have a beard.
Does he look like this?
Well, you're getting close but his physique is a little different.
Like this?
Yeah, yeah.
That's more like it, all right.
Jeannie, please, l can explain.
There's nothing to explain.
You have broken your promise.
l didn't break my promise.
General Barkley broke my promise.
-He ordered me to take out-- -Play chess?
Which one of you will make the first move?
He gets his orders from the State Department.
Try to understand why l have to take out Sonya.
Major Tiomkin.
Of course, master.
And try to understand why l must go out with Captain Healey.
-No, that's different.
-Good night, master.
You're being childish.
Wait, wait, wait!
That's General Barkley.
At least get back in the bottle until he's gone, please.
Very well.
l would not want you in trouble.
Thanks.
Now, if it's not General Barkley, l'm-- l'm gonna leave you in there until you cool off.
l'll let you out in two or three days.
Would you cut that out, huh?
-Oh, hi, Roge.
-Ready?
-Yeah.
Yup.
-You better grab a raincoat.
Cocoa Beach is having California weather.
-All right.
-Oh, boy, l tell you.
You sure you don't have Jeannie's phone number someplace?
Positive.
You know, on my way here, l stopped by the library hoping she'd be there.
l gotta find her.
l'm going right out of my mind.
Roge, you have a little black book with names from Abigail to Zelda.
-Forget about Jeannie.
-l can't forget her.
l'll find her if l have to spend the rest of my life in front of the library.
-Roge.
-Look, you got the girl.
-You're in a hurry.
-Yeah.
lt was wonderful night, Tony.
l wish it could go on forever.
We shake this cube, Posnovsky, and then we really kick it -around, nyet?
-Well, Sonya, l-- -Oh, sly dog.
-What?
Give me hour, and then we scooby-dooby at my pad, eh?
-Why did she do that?
-Maybe she knew what l was thinking.
Yeah.
Why don't you come in.
We'll have drink.
Nyet, Sonya.
Thank you, gentlemen, for interesting evening.
Good night.
As a matter of fact, l have to be running along too.
-What's the rush?
-l have to look in on this friend of mine.
When l left this friend earlier this evening, he was rather upset.
-l'll see you tomorrow.
Good night.
-Good night, Captain Nelson.
Captain, you have American cigarette?
American cigarette?
Oh, it's beautiful bottle.
lt's in my raincoat, but that's not my bottle.
lt's very unusual.
You really like it?
-Yours.
-Oh, thank you.
Wait till l show this to my friends in Russia.
You Americans are very generous.
Well, l better be going.
l have to drop in at the library.
l'm looking for a friend, and-- Marvelous.
l'm very sleepy myself.
lt's been such a long day.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Look what l brought you.
Jeannie?
Where is your bottle?
Jeannie.
Now, come on.
Stop kidding around.
l know you're angry, but-- Look, darling, l-- l know you're angry at me.
lf you'll just come out, l'll explain everything.
Darling, come out, wherever you are-- Roger.
-Who are you talking to?
-Nobody.
-You call nobody ''darling''?
-l was talking to myself, you know.
You call yourself ''darling?
'' l know you love you, but-- -What are you doing here?
-l figured out where you might have -Jeannie's number.
-Forget it!
Remember, you wrote phone numbers on the wall?
That's new wallpaper there.
We can rip it all off.
l can't rip any wallpaper down.
l lost a bottle.
-A bottle?
-A bottle!
That's funny.
l found one tonight.
-You what?
-Yeah, it was about this high.
-Right out of Antiquesville.
-Yeah, yeah.
That's it.
-Found it in my raincoat pocket.
-Oh, Roge.
You're a lifesaver.
-Hand it over.
-Too late.
-Sonya liked it, so l gave it to her.
-You what?
-Anything wrong with that?
-Anything wrong?
That bottle's in the hands of the Russians!
Whoever has that bottle can rule the world.
Oh, l'm sorry.
l was sure you would come.
l got home, Sonya, and l said why fight it?
l do not wish to fight.
-Do you like to dance?
-Crazy.
Tonight is the memory l take back to Russia.
l won't forget tonight myself.
You A-okay dancer.
l improvise as l go along.
lt's probably Posnovsky.
-Oh, good evening.
-Good evening, Major Tiomkin.
l have tomorrow's itinerary here for you.
Captain Nelson, you still here?
Oh, yes, yes.
l was just leaving, sir.
But Captain Nelson, you've just come back.
Just come back?
Where were you?
l had to look in on a sick friend.
ln fact, l better go see how this friend of mine is doing now.
Oh, please.
We still have so much to talk about.
Well-- No, l'd really better be running.
This friend of mine could kick up quite a fuss.
But the evening is just beginning.
-My bottle.
You're taking my bottle.
-Well.
-You took her bottle?
-No, sir.
No, sir.
Captain Healey gave it to her.
lt's really my bottle.
Well, if it's yours, l consider it even more precious gift.
-Oh, well, it's not exactly a gift.
-Give her back the bottle.
-l can't, sir-- -We'll buy you another one.
Sonya, l'd love to give it, but it's an heirloom.
lt's been in the family for generations.
You do not come back to see Sonya.
You come back for bottle.
Well, if that's how Americans treat their guests, keep it.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.
-Give her back the bottle!
-Oh, sir-- Our government would consider it an honour if you'd keep the bottle.
lt wouldn't.
Believe me, it wouldn't.
l'm not-- Captain Nelson, l'd like a word with you.
-Yes, but-- -Good night, major.
Sonya.
Major.
Hey!
Capitalist.
They warned me about American vodka.
You are my new mistress, master-- Or my new master, mistress.
Oh, it talks.
l am at your command.
You may have anything you wish.
l wish l don't drink so much vodka.
-Who are you?
-l am your genie.
Whoever has the bottle commands me.
lt's practical joke.
lt is true.
l can grant you any wish.
Any wish?
l test you.
Make Captain Nelson kick General Barkley.
Oh, no, master.
You would not want to do that.
-Can you do it?
-Well, of course l can.
Do it.
Oh, forgive me, ex-master.
Yes, sir.
Doctor, you can understand-- You kicked a general?
Well, no.
No, l didn't, sir.
Well, l-- l know it looked like l did, but l-- You see, it's the foot at the end of the leg.
You see, l haven't been able to control it since l walked in space.
He did it.
Just so l am sure, make him kick Dr. Bellows.
Oh, l'm sorry, ex-master.
l was just-- Well, there goes that foot again.
Dr. Bellows, l want you to give this man a complete examination tomorrow.
And if there's nothing wrong with him, he's mine, all mine.
-But, sir, l-- -Good night, captain.
Good night, sir.
Doctor, l'm sure there's an explanation.
Sonya.
Hey, Sonya, wait.
Wait a minute, Sonya.
Hey, let me in, huh?
Tell you what.
l'll give you $1 00 for the bottle.
Sonya?
Let me in.
-You can do anything?
-Anything.
-Major!
-Oh, boy, are we in business.
Yes, yes, thank you.
What do you mean, she's on her way to the airport?
Major Tiomkin wasn't scheduled to leave until tonight.
Sergeant, why wasn't l informed about this change in plans?
All right, all right.
Never mind.
Jeannie, wherever you are if you can do any moonlighting, grant me this one last favour: Get me to the airport on time.
Sir.
Now, captain, you and l are going to have a nice, long talk.
Could we talk a little later, sir?
l'm on my way to the airport.
You're on your way to a court-martial unless l have your full cooperation.
Now, let's start at the beginning.
As you know, captain, l've had you under observation for several months.
l'll only be an hour.
l'll be right back.
To date, you've had hallucinations you've heard voices and now you seem to have a bottle fetish.
For all these things, you've had dubious explanations.
-Half an hour?
-But there is no explanation -for striking a fellow officer.
-No.
l know that, sir.
That is the ultimate in irrational behaviour.
l know that.
-Bless you.
-You better watch that foot, doctor.
Flight 439 to Berlin, has it taken off yet?
There she goes.
We've lost.
The Russians have the bottle.
Roger, will you forget about Jeannie?
No, l mean, just consider her gone.
No, no, l mean really gone.
For good.
There's somebody at the door.
l'll talk to you later.
Yes, miss.
Sonya?
Formerly Sonya Tiomkin.
Now Betsy Ross.
-Betsy Ross?
-Yes.
This bottle made me what l always wanted to be: Wealthy American.
l think l understand.
Well, well, welcome aboard, Betsy.
l can guess why you're here.
You have everything you want -and you wanted to return the bottle?
-Yes, it's true.
l have villa on the Riviera, a mansion in Beverly Hills.
My chauffeur's waiting outside in my Rolls Royce.
But that's not everything l want.
-Yeah, what else is there?
-You.
-Me?
-l'll make you a deal.
You marry me, l give you bottle.
Marry you?
Well-- Well, l can't marry you.
l mean, well, l want Jeannie back desperately -but marriage is out of the question.
-Too bad.
You, me and bottle could have had the world.
Yeah, please at least may l say goodbye to Jeannie?
Why not?
But no tricks.
All right.
No tricks.
Oh, ex-master, darling.
l thought l would never see you again.
l thought l'd never see you again either, Jeannie.
-There's so much l want to say.
-There's so much l want to hear.
Betsy-- Sonya.
May l speak to Jeannie alone, please?
All right.
But l keep bottle here.
Hurry it up.
l want her to tell me who wins daily double -at Hialeah tomorrow.
-Yeah.
l'm gonna miss you terribly, Jeannie.
Oh, and l'm going to miss you, master.
l never realized just how much l'd miss you until this happened.
-You would like me to stay?
-Of course l-- -You mean, you could?
-lf she frees me.
Well, you heard what she said.
She's not gonna free you, and-- l can't marry her, Jeannie.
lf you want to keep me, you must.
Sonya, l've changed my mind.
lf you haven't changed yours, l'll marry you.
Darling, l'm going to make you very happy.
We'll fly to Mexico.
We'll be married before sunup.
Oh, wonderful!
And we can leave that there.
Anything you say, darling.
Stay there.
What's gonna happen when she finds out she's married a phony Tony?
l do not care, master, darling, as long as l have the real one.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Jeannie?
Jeannie, you ready?
Hey, we're gonna be late for the ball game.
Okay, let's-- ls that how you dress to go to a ball game?
Oh, no, master.
This is how l dress to be married.
Well, who are you gonna marry, Sandy Koufax?
-No, you, master.
-Now, Jeannie we've been through all this before.
l can't marry you.
-But you said you care for me.
-l do.
l do.
l think you're the most wonderful woman l've ever met.
-You're adorable.
-Well, then there's no problem.
We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman-- Now, hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
We're gathered here today to go to a baseball game.
Jeannie, get rid of him.
l don't have a ticket for him.
lf you care for me so much, why is it so difficult to say '' l do?
'' Well, it's not difficult.
lt's impossible.
Well, Roger wishes to marry me.
All right, fine.
Then marry Roger.
Now wait a minute.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, l'm sorry.
l didn't mean that.
Jeannie, l was only joking.
There's only one man I love.
John.
But you've told me that John doesn't want to marry you.
That's why I've come to you.
I need your advice, Mother.
On the other hand, there is a man you do love but who doesn't want to marry you.
What am I going to do, Mother, dear?
Oh, yes.
What are we going to do?
Susan, you did the right thing to come to your mother.
There's only one way to get him to propose to you.
Tune in at the same time tomorrow and learn what Susan's mother advises her to do.
Mother.
Of course.
This is a time when a girl needs her mother.
-Mama!
-Oh, little dove!
My darling, darling child.
lt's so good to see you again.
Two thousand years and not one letter.
Well, l have been busy.
Children.
Mama, l'm in love with my master, and l wish to marry him.
Can he support thee?
What does he do for a living?
He is an astronaut.
An astronaut?
What is that?
Well, they strap him in this giant bird they call a missile and he goes up into the sky, and around and around the earth for days without stopping.
And sometimes he walks in space.
Thou could not marry a doctor?
Well, l am not in love with a doctor, Mama.
Oh, l need your advice.
My master does not want to marry me but his friend Roger does.
Then marry his friend Roger.
You are not getting any younger.
Well, l-- l like Roger, but-- You brought me back for advice, l will give it to thee.
Tell this Roger you are going to marry him.
Oh, but that would be dishonest.
Show me a woman who is honest and l will show you an old maid.
Do not worry, dear one.
Thou wilt not marry Roger.
Your astronaut will come to his senses and marry you himself.
Do you really think this will come to pass?
That is how l got your father.
-Good evening, master.
-Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Oh, thanks.
You worked late tonight, master.
-Did you have a hard day?
-A bone-crusher.
Poor master.
Here.
Come over here and be comfortable.
Lie down.
Put your feet up.
And here is your newspaper.
And here's the rest of your martini.
-Thanks, Jeannie.
-l've made a special dish for your dinner.
You'll never guess what l have waiting in the kitchen.
-Your mother.
-Well, yes.
Your mother!
You can't be serious!
-Yes-- -What are you talking about?
l can't even explain you, much less your mother.
She will only be here for a few days.
l don't care if she's here for a few hours.
Send her back!
She doesn't eat much, and l'll take care of her.
You can't even take care of yourself.
Oh, master, l am so sorry.
l know you must find this a little strange.
Strange?
No.
No.
lt's not strange at all falling over a sheep in your own living room.
No, l don't think it's strange.
Come on.
Take your hands off that sheep, infidel.
lt is for the wedding feast.
The wedding feast?
The wedding feast?
-Did you tell her we're getting married?
-Certainly not.
That would be a lie.
-That's right.
-Because l'm not marrying you.
-That's right.
-l'm going to marry Roger.
Gonna marry Roger.
You're-- You're not serious.
-Well, l-- -Of course she is serious.
-Of course l am serious.
-Yeah, but you can't marry Roger.
And why not?
He loves her.
Well, yes.
Why not?
He loves me.
Because-- Because l'd miss you, that's why.
Oh, and l would miss thee too.
-Then you're not gonna marry Roger?
-The sheep is already here.
Perhaps you can think of another solution.
-How about lamb chops for dinner?
-l will marry him.
l wouldn't put that wedding dress back on just yet if l were you.
Roger's pretty unpredictable.
As a matter of fact, around the base he's known as ''Old Fickle.
'' Fickle!
Oh, Mama, l think it is working.
He is jealous.
-What shall l do next?
-That does not worry me, little pigeon.
What worries me is what he will do next.
-Hi, Roge.
What's the good word?
-The good word is ''yes.
'' l ran into Jeannie, popped the question and she said she would marry me.
Me!
Did she really?
Well, congratulations.
From now on, it's marriage-a-go-go.
-Couldn't happen to a finer guy.
-We're meeting for lunch.
We're going over our plans.
Say, l'll bet her parents were delirious when they found out Jeannie got a catch like you.
Well, l-- l haven't met her parents yet.
-They're out of town, huh?
-Well, l don't know.
l suppose so.
lt's-- Where are they when you pick Jeannie up at her house?
Well, l've never been to Jeannie's house before.
Well, where do you meet?
ln front of the public library.
Well, she must have a house.
Or your gonna be married at the return book counter.
Until you mentioned it l never really gave her parents or her home a thought.
Well, parents, homes, what's the difference?
The important thing is you love her.
-That's right.
-Right.
You'll have plenty of opportunity to get to know her parents once they move in with you.
-Move in?
-You know, when they come to visit.
Oh, boy, all you have to do is take a look at that girl and know that her parents have to be fine, intelligent people.
No, she wasn't brought up by convicts or counterfeiters, you know.
l think fine, intelligent people would like to meet the man their daughter's gonna marry.
Yeah.
Well there's all kinds of good reasons why they haven't met you yet.
Well, for instance.
No.
Or they might have been.
Well, no, l'll tell you what.
lt's possible, it's just.
The important thing is you're marrying a wonderful girl.
-That's the important thing.
-Yes.
l'll see you later, Roge.
Maybe we'll get a chance to crack a bottle of champagne tonight, huh?
Well, there are many good reasons why l haven't met her parents.
You know, they could've been out of-- Probably-- Well, they are probably.
lt's very easy to.
Convicts and counterfeiters?
l do not understand it.
All during lunch Roger kept insisting.
How can l invite him to my house when l do not have one?
And worse yet, you do not have parents either.
l have you, Mama.
And l could send for Papa.
l would be proud to have Roger meet you.
No, no, little one.
We are peasants from the old country.
One look at us, and there goeth the ball game.
Where did you learn that expression?
From watching that box you call television.
l know what you need.
The American mama you see on television.
The one who keeps comparing hands with her daughter.
-You think so, Mama?
-l'm certain of it.
And for the father, get yourself that nice fellow who-- Who seems to have so much trouble with his sinuses.
Mama, l'm so glad l sent for you.
And l know just where l'm going to get the house too.
Oh, there is my master.
Well, Mama, how's every little thing?
You dare to show your face here?
Look who's talking.
lt's my house.
l suppose it was not you who persuaded Roger to insist upon meeting my daughter's parents and seeing her home?
Well, l-- l suppose l did drop a hint or two.
ls Jeannie terribly disappointed about her marriage being called off?
Wait and see.
-Yes?
-Oh, hello, sir.
l can only stay a moment.
l just want to say hello to my new neighbour.
Oh, you bought a house around here?
Oh, not a house.
The vacant lot across the street from you.
Mrs. Bellows and l are gonna start building very shortly.
Well, you can always borrow a cup of sugar here.
May the vultures descend and pick your bones.
My housekeeper.
We had a little argument this morning about her salary.
She wanted a raise, and l wouldn't give it to her, you know.
'' May the vultures descend and pick your bones.
'' Well, she's a poor loser.
And l was worried about moving in with a hamster.
Oh!
Hi, Jeannie.
How was your lunch with Roger?
He's very anxious to meet my parents.
Oh, well, that's-- That's too bad.
So he's going to meet Mama.
And Papa too.
-Your papa's here too?
-Oh, not yet.
Captain Healey is going to meet them at my house.
This is your house.
l mean, this is your house.
Oh, not today, master.
l have my own home.
Yes?
Oh, hi, Roge.
What do you mean, you're gonna meet her parents at her home?
Oh, no, no, no, No, l'm not upset.
l'm not upset at all.
Hey, listen, where did you say she lives?
Across the street from my house?
Well, that's impossible.
Well, there's a vacant lot across the street.
Listen, Roger, when l say there's a vacant lot across the street l mean there's a house on it.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, where are you?
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
Now, you-- You take that house right out of here.
You're not gonna get away with this!
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
Jeannie, open up.
Jeannie, come on.
Take this house down this minute.
Now-- -Are you expected?
-Oh, boy.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
lf you will leave your card, l will tell my daughter you called.
Jeannie, where are you?
Good afternoon, Mr. Nelson.
Teresa, will you please pour Mr. Nelson a cup of tea?
Teresa?
Jeannie, l want you to stop this nonsense, and l mean it.
l want you to come home right now.
l cannot ask you to stay very long, Mr. Nelson.
My fiancÃ© is coming to meet Mummy and Daddy.
Mummy and Daddy?
You whipped up some phony parents too?
The kind you see on television.
lt was Mama's suggestion.
What do you think you're doing?
You'll never get away with this.
l don't want any tea.
l don't want any tea.
You must calm yourself, master.
You're very upset.
You're darn right l'm upset.
And l have every reason in the world to be upset.
lt's a large lot, general.
Across the street from Captain Nelson's house.
Oh, really?
lt's Dr. Bellows and General Hadley.
They're coming down the street.
They're coming right here.
Oh, well, l will be delighted to meet them.
Oh, no, you-- No, you don't understand.
You see-- Dr. Bellows, he just bought this lot.
And he knows.
He just-- He knows there's no house on it.
And he's gonna want me to explain.
And there is no explanation.
Jeannie, do you want me to plead insanity?
Please, master.
Relax.
l would never do anything to hurt you.
Good afternoon, Captain Nelson.
Good afternoon, General Hadley.
Captain, do you always drink tea in the middle of a vacant lot?
Well, sir, it was such a lovely afternoon l thought l'd have my tea out here among the wildflowers.
Do you do this often, Captain Nelson?
When l want to commune with nature, sir -like Thoreau.
-Thoreau?
Yes, yes.
He used to do it all the time.
Well, l'd better go home and tend my sheep.
Sheep?
l'd keep an eye on that man, doctor.
Oh, l do, sir.
All the time.
He's done a number of strange things but l've never caught him weed-sitting before.
Good evening, doctor.
General.
You're working late, Captain Healey?
Yes, l had a few data reports to finish up.
l've got a big night planned.
l may be late coming in tomorrow morning.
Just see that Captain Nelson is in before dawn.
-He's been under quite a strain lately.
-l'm not seeing Captain Nelson.
l'm going to my fiancÃ©e's for dinner.
But l might see him.
He lives right across the street.
Across the street?
-No house there.
That's my vacant lot.
-lt can't be a vacant lot.
Well, it is when people aren't drinking tea on it.
The number is 1 1 40 Oak Road.
Well, general, good doctor.
-Have a nice evening.
-Eleven-forty?
That's the address of my property.
He's having dinner in a vacant lot.
Better keep an eye on him too.
One weed-sitter in the space program is enough.
There we are.
Now, after Roger has met your parents and you have had dinner then sit in the chair by the window with him.
Why the chair by the window, Mama?
Because across the street your master will be watching and be sick with jealousy.
-There's Roger.
-Good.
Bring out your parents.
-What do you think, Mama?
-There is something missing.
But they look just like the people on television commercials.
She should have blonde hair.
That's better.
He should look more like he has money.
What do you think?
l think you are ready for Roger.
Oh, yes.
-Hi, Jeannie.
-Good evening, Roger.
l would like you to meet my parents.
Mummy and Daddy, this is Roger.
Hello.
l've been looking forward to meeting you two for quite some time.
When my daughter told me she was engaged, l said: '' Darling, blondes do have more fun.
'' My wife used to be a ratty brunette.
ls your hair streaked with dingy, unattractive gray?
Mine was.
But then l learned about Streakaway.
Now l can't resist asking her to dance.
-Would you?
-Love to.
Do you like my mummy and daddy?
Yeah, they're a very, very romantic couple.
l was just telling your daughter how much in love you two seem to be.
Why wouldn't l be?
Her hands are as soft now as they were when we were first married.
l never use any harsh detergents.
My daughter and l have used the same soap to wash dishes for years and my hands are as soft as hers.
Would you care to make the comparison test?
They're lovely.
Both hands.
Have you noticed they both have lovely smiles too?
l'm not afraid to smile anymore since l started using Grippo.
Now, l don't have to be afraid my dentures will fall out.
Let us all sit down and get acquainted.
Why don't you sit here beside Jeannie?
Won't that be a little crowded?
We're not afraid of being in crowds.
We're protected for 32 hours.
-l use the roll-on.
-l use the spray.
l could use a martini.
Here you are.
-Dr. Bellows.
-Great Scott.
Captain Nelson, it's you.
lf it wasn't you, that would mean -that l was on the wrong street.
-l beg your pardon, sir.
Now, captain, since both of us are basically scientists we know it's entirely possible with modern methods of prefabrication to build a house in 20 minutes.
You believe that, don't you, captain?
-No, sir.
-l don't either.
lf you'll look across the street, you'll see a house on my vacant lot.
-What house is that, sir?
-Don't humour me, captain.
When l tell you there's a house across the street, l mean there's a-- A vacant lot.
With Captain Healey sitting in the middle of it.
Captain Healey, sir?
l think l'll go home and lie down.
That might be best, sir.
And everything you've said tonight will, of course, remain strictly between us.
Thank you, Jeannie.
l knew you wouldn't let me down.
-You are pleased with me, master?
-l certainly am pleased with you.
Well, then may l invite a friend over?
Yeah, you can invite over anybody you want to.
We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony.
Oh, good morning, Roge.
How are you feeling?
Terrible.
Oh, boy.
Terrible.
-What a night.
-Yeah?
Well, what happened?
Did you meet Jeannie's mother and father?
Yeah, l met them, all right.
lt was like tuning into a commercial.
Don't get me wrong.
They were great.
You know, real backbone of America.
What's so terrible about that?
Me.
Boy, l must have been on liquid oxygen.
You know, l got so smashed, l blacked out wandered outside of the house, and wound up in a vacant lot.
-No.
-Yeah.
Boy, she must really be sore at me.
l went back there to apologize to her today, and she moved.
l mean, she moved.
The whole house was gone.
Now l'm gonna have to start looking for her all over again.
Well, good luck, Roge.
Good luck.
Yeah.
Look, Tony, if you run across her maybe you could let me know, if you.
-Sure, Roge.
-Sure.
lt's a.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Boy, this is thirsty work.
Oh.
Thank you, Jeannie.
-Jeannie.
-Yes, master?
What is this stuff?
-Tubla.
-Tastes like it.
Would you like some more?
No, no.
l-- No.
lt tastes terrible.
Well, it was very popular in Pompeii.
Yeah, sure.
And look what happened to Pompeii.
Oh, Jeannie, would you blink off.
All right.
-Hi, Tony.
-Oh, good morning, Roge.
Boy, what a morning.
Wait.
You're not gonna like that.
lf it's good enough for you, it's good enough for me.
You drink a lot of that?
-l warned you.
-What is it?
lt's called tubla.
lt used to be very popular in Pompeii.
Yeah, look what happened to Pompeii.
l've got to tell you something.
-You better get a girl.
-What are you talking about?
l heard Dr. Bellows and General Peterson discussing the results of the tests they made.
They compared the emotional stability of the unmarried astronaut -and the married astronaut.
-Yeah?
And the married astronaut came off And Dr. Bellows said if there's anyone that should have a wife, it's you.
Well, that's ridiculous.
How can l get married?
l don't even have a girl.
Well, l just thought l'd tip you off.
You'll be hearing from Dr. Bellows.
All right.
Thanks, Roge.
-Well, any time.
-Okay.
l'll be your best-- Best man.
Okay, Jeannie, he's gone.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
l will be with you in a moment, master.
l am just finishing my wedding dress.
lt's charming, charming.
But would you mind getting rid of this outfit now?
-You do not like it?
-l like it very much.
But l'm not planning on getting married, and neither are you.
But Dr. Bellows wants you to get married.
Well, l don't think you're exactly what he had in mind.
Now, would you mind taking this off?
Thank you.
Oh, and get rid of the wedding dress too, please.
Yes?
Thank you.
You are the most unromantic master l've ever had.
l wish you could let yourself go and act like-- Like what?
Like this.
Jeannie, darling.
You're the most beautiful, the most wonderful thing in my life.
Don't ever leave me.
Jeannie.
How-- How do you do that?
Well, technically, it is a variation of the lndian rope trick.
Well, technically, get rid of him.
l don't like it.
Oh, but l do.
Let's be married.
Right now.
All right.
Knock it off.
Why cannot you treat me like this, master?
Because l'm late for a lunch date, that's why.
Let him go.
We can be alone together.
Oh, you can, huh?
l don't know what you see in him.
He's got a very weak chin.
Get rid of him.
l mean it.
Get rid of him.
That's better.
l don't wanna see me here again.
l mean, him around here.
-You know what l mean.
-No, master.
-Huh?
-Yes, master.
Before l go, l want you to know just one thing.
Yes?
You're the most beautiful, the most wonderful thing in my life.
Oh, master.
Then we are going to be married.
No, no.
l'm afraid not.
l want you to consider me as your-- Your bosom friend.
Captain Nelson?
Hello.
Hello.
-Who are you?
-l am nobody.
l mean, l just drop by to cook Captain Nelson's dinner.
-Do you do this often?
-Oh, every night.
That's strange.
He's never mentioned you to me.
l'm Colonel Bellows, the base psychiatrist.
l know.
-Nelson's talked about me?
-Every day.
You and Captain Nelson must be old acquaintances.
Oh, we are bosom friends.
Are you?
l'm afraid l didn't get your name.
-Jeannie.
-l'm delighted to meet you, Jeannie.
-That smells good.
-The bread, the pie or the cake?
You're baking bread, pie and cake?
Oh, yes.
Captain Nelson loves my baking.
You may be just what the doctor ordered.
l am afraid l do not understand.
Well, there are so many flighty young girls around it's a pleasure to meet a real, old-fashioned homebody for a change.
l mean, wife material.
lf you don't mind my saying so, it looks as though Nelson has struck gold.
Oh, l do not mind your saying so.
For his own sake, l hope he appreciates you.
l've just finished making a survey of married astronauts and Captain Nelson is in a lot of trouble.
Oh, he appreciates me.
He apprecia-- l will show you.
Darling, l couldn't stay away another minute.
-Captain.
-Look who's here.
Who's he?
Well, l. l. l've seen men in love before this, but-- Well, this is-- This is marvellous!
How soon are you gonna be married?
Tonight.
Now.
That may be rushing things a bit.
Why don't we say Sunday?
-l can't wait.
-Sunday will be fine.
l'll spread the good word.
l hope you'll have me to dinner.
-Oh, we will often.
-Thank you, Jeannie.
Carry on, captain.
-Stop it.
He is gone.
-But darling, l love you.
l hope l did not get my master in trouble.
Well, Captain Healey.
The secret is out, and you never said a word.
No, sir.
lf you talk about it, it isn't a secret.
What secret are we talking about, sir?
Captain Nelson's wedding.
Sunday.
Tony getting married Sunday?
That's ridiculous.
l heard him propose, captain.
He wanted to get married tonight.
-You didn't know?
-He didn't say a word to me.
This morning he told me he didn't have a girl.
Well, he has, and l must say, l was impressed with her.
Feet on the ground.
And a beauty.
How do you like that.
My best friend.
l like it.
l'll see you at the wedding, Sunday.
Maybe he doesn't want me to be at the wedding.
Maybe he's ashamed to have me meet her.
l'm all right to go up in space with, right?
But he doesn't want me to mingle with him on Earth.
Hey, Roge.
Hi.
l wouldn't be your best man Sunday if you got down on your knees and begged me!
-There you are.
-Oh, yes, sir.
You wanted to see me?
Yes.
Yes.
Come in.
Come in.
-Have some coffee.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
Congratulations, captain.
Well, thank you very much.
What did l do?
lt's what you're going to do.
Frankly, l was worried about you.
But not anymore.
Not after Sunday.
-Sunday?
-And don't forget l expect to be invited to dinner for some of that homemade bread.
lt smelled delicious.
Jeannie's a wonderful girl.
l could see that you're both very much in love.
l'm a psychiatrist.
l know the real thing when l see it.
-lt must have been very sudden.
-You might say that, sir.
When did it first hit you?
About 1 0 seconds ago.
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
This time you've gone too far.
How could you do this to me?
Well, l was trying to help you, master.
You would be in trouble if you were not married.
So l. Jeannie, darling, l can't wait until Sunday.
Student Prince is back.
l'll get it, l'll get it.
-Hello.
-Dr. Bellows here, captain.
Oh, hello, sir.
l just talked with General Peterson and told him the good news.
He's delighted.
He's staying over to attend the wedding on Sunday afternoon.
Well, that's very kind of the general but would you inform him that l have no intention of-- No intention of what?
No intention of waiting until Sunday afternoon.
We're getting married Sunday morning.
Yes.
We'll be looking forward to seeing you and the general there.
Goodbye.
You won't get away with this.
l'm going to tell Bellows the wedding is off!
Oh, you cannot, master.
How will you explain it?
That's very easy.
l'll just tell him-- l'll say-- They'll lock me up.
Not if you marry me.
Oh, l will make you very happy.
You're wasting yourself on him.
l'm the one who loves-- Will you butt out of this?
-Get rid of him.
-Get rid of me?
This is my house.
Send him away, darling.
Stop it.
Stop it!
Go away!
You heard what she said, lover boy.
Knock it off!
Darling, from the moment l met you, l knew that we were meant for-- -Amazing.
-l am sorry, master.
lt is just impossible these days to get reliable help.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Good morning.
Here's the impatient bridegroom.
l'll bet you can't wait for Sunday.
Well.
Roge.
That's what l wanted to talk to you about.
Would you excuse me?
Something l gotta straighten out.
l can't wait for Sunday either.
-Hey, Roger.
-Just call me Captain Healey.
What's the matter with you?
Matter?
Oh, nothing's the matter.
My best friend is getting married, doesn't say a word to me and l have to hear it from strangers.
l am not getting married on Sunday.
l don't know what you're trying to hide.
lf you found someone else for your best man, why don't you just say so?
My feelings won't be hurt.
Anyway, l'm-- l'm busy Sunday.
l'm going fishing.
Will you stop acting like this?
l'm not getting married.
Dr. Bellows said he heard you propose.
Forget about what Dr. Bellows said.
-You just listen to what l-- -Captain Nelson!
General Peterson.
l just want to offer my congratulations.
-Thank you very much, sir.
-ls it gonna be a large wedding?
Well, l really don't know yet, sir.
Well, thank you for inviting me.
-lt's my pleasure.
My pleasure.
-Captain.
-Roge.
-Captain Healey.
l'll move my golf clubs out of your locker the first thing tomorrow morning.
This is my office.
All right, Jeannie, l've had it.
l want you here.
l want you here right now!
Come on.
Good afternoon, master, darling.
Don't you fool yourself.
This will be one of the worst afternoons of your life.
Now, l've had just about enough from you-- Jeannie, what do you think you're doing?
You're excited, master.
A nice steam bath will calm you down.
l don't wanna calm down.
l wanna get out of here.
Well, it's solid gold.
lt belonged to King Tut.
l don't care if it belonged to-- To-- Captain Healey.
Call me Roger.
l-- l came to apologize.
You don't have anything to apologize for.
Well, l got to thinking.
Just because we're good friends, there's no reason why l have to be your best man.
And l just wanted to let you know there are no hard feelings.
Of course not, Roge.
-lsn't it warm in there?
-No, no.
No, no.
That's-- That's new, isn't it?
Yeah, it's sort of new, yeah.
lt looks like solid gold.
-ls that--?
-Yeah, l think it is.
'' King Tut sat here.
'' Well, you haven't lost your sense of humour.
Well, look, l probably won't see you before the wedding.
l just wanted to let you know how l felt.
Thanks.
Thanks, Roge.
l don't think there will be a wedding.
You don't think?
No.
No.
Well, you know, there are a lot of things to pull together.
Sure you haven't had enough of that?
No, no, no.
l like it.
l could stay in here for hours.
Well, l guess l won't meet the bride until l get back.
Well, believe me, if there's a bride, you'll meet her.
Well, best of luck, Tony.
Thanks.
King Tut.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Jeannie, l'm boiling to death!
l am sorry, master.
Captain Healey stayed too long.
Yeah, he sure did.
What would you like for a wedding present?
A diamond mine in Africa?
The presidency of-- -l know.
Monte Carlo.
-You know what l'd like?
-What?
-l'd like to be a bachelor.
l'm not going through with this.
And if l don't, l'm gonna be in terrible trouble.
But, master, it is for your own good.
Jeannie, listen.
Try to understand this.
ln the service, the kind of a woman a man marries is very important.
''And what does your wife do, Captain Nelson?
'' She's a genie, sir.
l put her in a bottle every night.
-How will that look on my record?
-What are you going to do?
l'm going to Dr. Bellows' office and tell him l've changed my mind.
But.
Thank you.
Come in.
-May l have a word with you, sir?
-l always have time for young lovers.
Do you want some prenuptial advice?
No.
That's not exactly what l wanted to talk to you about.
Sit down, captain.
lt's about Sunday.
Oh, thank you.
lt's about Sunday, sir.
There's been a change in plans.
You want to get married early Sunday morning.
l don't blame you.
How's Jeannie?
Oh, fine.
Well, she's not fine.
Well, the point is, sir, you've only met her once.
And, well, you don't know what she's like.
You're quite wrong, captain.
l'm a psychiatrist.
l know more about her than you'll ever know.
Would you like to bet?
l pride myself on being a rather keen judge of human nature.
Human nature.
Well, that's not exactly what we're talking about.
-What?
-Well, l mean-- You don't-- You don't know about Jeannie.
Well, l know she's beautiful.
l know she loves you.
She's intelligent.
She enjoys cooking and taking care of a home.
-Would you say that was true?
-Oh, yes, yes, yes.
She has a lovely, sweet disposition.
l'd say you picked the perfect bride, captain.
Well, l didn't exactly pick her, sir.
You're a lucky man.
You don't know how lucky.
Do you know what this is?
This is your medical file.
l was waiting until it got larger then l was gonna send it to Washington.
There are things in here that would curl your hair, captain.
But do you know what l'm gonna do with this file?
Now that you're marrying that girl there'll be no more incidents.
There'll be no more behaving peculiarly.
You're gonna stop talking to walls, hearing voices and 1 1 6 other things listed here.
Do you know what the greatest thing of all is, captain?
No, sir.
l'm going to start sleeping nights.
Yes, sir.
l can't tell you how much l'm looking forward to Sunday.
Well, anything else, captain?
No.
No.
That's about all, sir.
But if l think of anything, believe me you'll be the first to know.
-Master?
-Go away.
-Master?
-Out!
-Master?
-Oh, Jeannie.
What do you want?
Don't answer that!
Don't answer that!
Are you satisfied?
Finally, you got me in a corner l can't get out of.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
There is a way out.
No, master.
lf you call off the wedding, you will be in trouble.
Yes, yes.
That's right.
So l'm not calling off the wedding.
-You are not?
-No.
No.
You are.
Why would l do a silly thing like that?
Because l'm telling you to.
l'm ordering you to!
l'm begging you to.
Oh, l cannot.
This wedding is for your own good.
Jeannie, you'd hate being married to me.
l'm temperamental, l'm grouchy in the morning l'm a sloppy-- l'm sloppy!
-Look at this place.
l'm sloppy.
-l know, l know.
l adore it.
-Then you won't call off the wedding?
-Of course not, master.
Sunday morning, you are going to be the happiest man in the whole world.
Oh, don't you believe it.
l will show you how you will act on Sunday.
Angel, l've been looking for you everywhere.
Would you get rid of that slob?
He's beginning to annoy me.
But he does not annoy me.
Yeah, l can see that.
You'll have to make up your mind which one of us you want.
-l want you.
Acting like him.
-Forget it.
Can't we get rid of him?
Cast a spell on him.
Make him vanish.
We can be together always.
Well, maybe we could.
Now, Jeannie, you wouldn't do that to me.
l'm your master.
He's not even real.
But he loves me so much.
We can go away together, just the two of us.
What are you, a home-wrecker?
-That's my fiancÃ©e you're talking to.
-Marry me.
She may be anxious to get married, but she's not stupid.
You couldn't support her.
You're not even real.
l'm trying to talk her out of marrying a figment of her own imagination.
Oh, boy.
Come with me, Jeannie.
He's not going to marry you.
Oh, yes, he is.
Sunday morning.
Jeannie, please, don't-- Don't send me away.
l love you.
l'll be back.
lt is bad luck to see the bride before the wedding, so l am leaving.
But l will see you at the church Sunday morning.
Now, do not be late.
l'm so excited.
Where the devil is Captain Nelson?
!
Oh, l am sure he will be here any moment.
l warned him not to-- Well, l told him not to be late.
Of course he'll be here any minute, if he knows what's good for him.
Forgive me for being late.
lt's inexcusable.
-Oh, Captain Nelson.
-lt's time you call me Tony.
My angel.
l thought this morning would never get here.
What are we standing here for?
Let's get married.
Put her down!
That comes later.
You can't blame me for getting carried away.
Excuse me, sir.
Come with me.
And you.
Come with me!
Dearly beloved, we are gathered together to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
Captain.
Captain, couldn't you wait until the ceremony is over?
Could you talk a little faster, sir?
l've waited so long for this day.
We'll have a honeymoon.
We're going on a six-month holiday.
No, no, no.
No, a year.
Oh, don't worry about him.
He's not coming.
Dearly beloved we are gathered together to join this man and this woman in the bonds of holy matrimony.
l will, l will.
l do, l do.
Well, l do not!
l cannot marry this man!
Captain Nelson.
What the devil happened?
l have no idea, sir.
She just ran out.
l'm sorry, captain.
l know how you must feel.
Do you?
He tried to warn me, but l wouldn't listen.
That's a very unstable girl.
l think you're a lucky man to be out of it.
Thank you, sir.
General.
-Captain.
-Captain.
l'll be all right.
Oh, thank you.
Jeannie?
Well, hi.
What are you doing here?
l thought by this time you'd be on your honeymoon.
So did l. Well, didn't you--?
Didn't you get married?
No, master.
Oh, well-- Well, that-- That phony Tony came over here and said he was on his way to marry you so l just stayed away.
Did you?
-Didn't l?
-No, master.
l knew it was you at the chapel.
-You did?
-Of course l did.
Well, why didn't you go through with the ceremony?
Because thou went to so much trouble not to marry me.
l will never force myself on you.
Jeannie.
You're marvellous.
l wonder what would have happened if we had gotten married?
You will never know, will you?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
What's the matter?
l do not know, master.
l feel so weak, as if all my strength had gone.
You should've left me in my bottle on the beach so l would not be any trouble to you.
You're no trouble.
Perhaps it is finally my age.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're the youngest 2000-year-old woman l've ever known.
You probably have a touch of the virus.
You-- You get a lot of rest today and l'll go to the base and grab-- You must not leave without your breakfast.
lf you're not feeling well, l'll get breakfast at the base.
No.
l will feel even worse if l do not attend my master.
-Are you sure?
-Oh, l am sure.
All right.
Half an egg?
You really aren't well, are you?
Jeannie.
l'd ask you to conjure up a doctor but l'd hate to see what he'd look like.
Young lady, you're going to bed.
l mean right now.
Oh, well, l-- l am sure l will be all right, master.
Now, who's the master around here?
Now, you lie down on that couch and you get plenty of rest today.
l'll give you a ring later on, okay?
Bye.
My car's in the shop.
l have to call a cab.
l will conjure one up for you, master.
No, no, no, l'm not kidding-- And after that, l will lie down all day.
l promise.
All right, if you're sure.
Okay.
-Hi, Roge.
-Good morning.
Well, congratulate me.
l am about to fall in love again.
Oh, yeah?
What's her name?
-l don't know.
l haven't met her yet.
-Oh, Roge.
Now, come on.
l mean it.
According to my horoscope a beautiful, gorgeous brunette is entering my life today.
Horoscope?
You're kidding.
l see we have another sceptic.
You see this?
ln two weeks, this horoscope hasn't been wrong.
l happen to be a Libra, and Venus is my ruling planet.
-You're telling me.
-See these two parallel lines?
They indicate a beautiful Sagittarius is crossing my path today.
See?
-Kind of skinny, isn't she?
-Very funny.
Very funny.
l'll tell you when l meet her.
When were you born?
Twenty-fifth of July.
July the 25th?
July.
That's a Leo.
July the 25th.
Leo, Leo, Leo.
Mars is your solar fifth house.
Today you're going on a trip.
A long, long trip to a far-off place.
Well, l am testing a new module.
-What did l tell you?
-lndoors.
lndoors or outdoors, what do you expect from a 35-cent magazine?
Hey, wait a minute.
lt also says you're going to meet many strangers.
Nobody any stranger than you.
Hey, look at this!
Jupiter's in direct juxtaposition to Mercury today.
How about that?
That's the first time that's happened in 2000 years.
You don't really believe this, do you?
l mean, you're an astronaut.
l know.
But l don't wanna take any unnecessary chances.
Hey, look, we'd better be going.
Dr. Bellows is waiting for us.
Okay.
l just gotta make a phone call.
All right, but l wouldn't keep him waiting too long if l were you.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Jeannie.
How you feeling?
Oh, master, l'm so glad you called.
l do not wish to worry you but one of my feet is missing.
Missing?
Well, where did you put it?
l mean, how could one of your feet be missing?
lt just vanished.
No.
Now, that's impossible.
You must have misplaced it.
You look for your foot while l wait.
Try the end of your leg.
No?
Did you look behind the couch?
lt has come back, master.
Good girl.
l knew you'd find it.
But l'm losing my hand.
Now, don't let your hand get away from you.
Hold your hand with your other hand.
Don't panic.
lt could happen to anybody.
l have it back.
But l feel so weak.
Now, you stay there and hold on to your hands and feet until l get there.
And if they start to disappear again-- lt's been nice chatting with you.
-Who was that, captain?
-An old friend, sir.
-A man or woman?
-Woman.
And her arms and her legs are missing?
No, sir.
They're back.
l mean, it sounds like a case of delirium tremens.
Your friend drinks a lot?
l think it's safe to say she spends most of her time with her bottle.
At least l think l see.
With you, l never know.
l owe you a lot, captain.
-Me, sir?
-Yes.
At one time, l was thinking of retiring.
l was getting bored.
But do you know something?
Once you came to the space program, l haven't had one boring minute.
Oh, well, l'm glad l'm able to amuse you, sir.
Oh, l'm not amused.
l'm baffled.
And l'm gonna stay right here until l get to the bottom of what it is about you that baffles me.
l'm really a very simple man.
Of course you are.
You drink salt water.
You keep horses in your living room.
You carry on conversations with bottles.
And you know what you said to your friend when her hand disappeared?
'' Don't panic.
lt could happen to anyone.
'' Just a figure of speech, sir.
l'm going to add it to my collection.
You have a test coming up, captain.
l'll meet you in the testing room.
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
l told you to stay home and rest.
lt is no use, master.
Something has happened to me.
l am vanishing.
No.
No, all you need is a good night's sleep.
l cannot understand what has happened to me.
lf you don't feel better by tonight, we'll get you a good doctor.
No doctor could-- What is this, master?
lt's just some nonsense Roger left here.
-Jeannie, it's very important that-- -Master, look!
-Jupiter and Mercury are together.
-Oh, fine, fine.
-l have to go to the test-- -This is the day of the Ram.
Good.
lt's about time they won a game.
You do not understand.
On the day of the Ram, every genie and master must make a pilgrimage to Mecca.
l faced east when l shaved this morning.
lsn't that enough?
-You don't really believe in-- -Please do not jest, master.
lt is why l have been so ill today.
lt is written that on this day, my master must appear in the thieves' market at the Well of Madahar face the Minaret of the Rising Sun, and repeat the sacred words.
l've gotta be in a test chamber with Dr. Bellows in two minutes.
Oh, please, master.
lf Ramdah is not appeased, l shall lose my power and disappear into limbo forever.
Will you stop believing this superstitious nonsense.
Now, l want you to go home and lie down.
Hello.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
l'm on my way.
Yes.
All right, captain.
We're gonna concentrate on your reaction to re-entry oscillations.
Any specific directions, sir?
Oh, we'll give you your directions during the ride.
Affirmative.
All right.
Hold on, Tony, l'll give you some pitch and yaw.
How you feeling, captain?
What a ride.
We'll stabilize the vehicle.
Stand by for the next manoeuvre.
What are you doing here?
l work here, captain.
I wasn't talking to you, sir.
He's doing it again.
You've gotta get out of here.
Master, we must leave for Mecca now, while there is still time.
l'm not going to Mecca!
Did you say you're not going to Mecca?
l said, '' l'm not going to make it.
'' l think you'd better bring me down.
Jeannie, you gotta get out of here right now.
All right, master.
Farewell.
What's the matter?
l am losing my hand.
Are you on the level about this Mecca thing?
lt is the only way we can save me.
Okay.
Okay, l'll-- l'll go.
Can you hold on?
l'll try.
But you will get into trouble if you leave here now.
Oh, forget about that.
I'll meet you at home.
Okay.
-Captain.
Captain!
-Yes, sir.
Captain, l want to see you in my office in five minutes.
Could we make it tomorrow, sir?
l've got an emergency-- This is an emergency, captain.
How did you know we would meet today, captain?
You can't fight fate.
Roger, l wanna talk to you a minute.
Well, here she is.
Out of my horoscope, into my life.
This is Tony Nelson.
Pardon me, Diane.
Hi.
How are you?
Very nice to meet you.
You mean it works?
l told you, it never fails.
May l speak to you alone, please?
Yeah.
l'll be right back.
Don't go away-- You remember the time you said l was gonna take a trip -and meet strangers?
-Yeah.
That time has come.
l need a favour.
Make it a short favour.
Diane's waiting.
l want you to get in Bellows' office, keep him busy for a couple hours.
Keep him busy?
How?
Well, l don't know how.
Talk about astrology.
Oh, come on.
He'll think l'm crazy.
Yeah.
That's the idea.
l'll be back as soon as l can.
Wait, wait, wait.
Where will you be if l need you?
Mecca.
Okay, Jeannie.
Come on.
Get us to Mecca.
Oh, bless thee, master.
l hope it is not too late.
Take hold of my hand.
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
Jeannie, where are you?
l'm sorry, master.
l had to stop and change.
Oh, your legs.
Yeah.
Well, let's look for that Well of the Madahar-- -Master, we are in trouble.
-What's the matter now?
l've forgotten where the thieves' market is.
-We can't stand around here.
-What are we going to do?
Talk to the first thief that comes along.
May l assist you, if l can?
Move along, sister.
l'll take this one.
-He's with me.
-l'm with you too, baby.
You two cats wanna dig the scene?
We're looking for the thieves' market.
We're in a hurry.
Thieves' market?
l never heard of that one.
Let's see, there's the Cockeyed Camel the Purple Pyramid, the Fez West.
What is this place?
A discotheque?
No, no, no.
Thou does not understand.
Look, baby, let me take you to the Basin Street Middle East.
Man, it swings.
We're looking for the thieves' market near the Well of the Madahar.
l get it!
Souvenirs.
l can steer you to all that jazz.
Persian rugs, pictures of pyramids till you hold them up to the light.
-No, no.
The old thieves' market.
-You gotta be kidding.
That jazz went out with high-button veils.
-What you kids want-- -The thieves' market.
-No watusi joints?
No souvenirs?
-Where is it?
You're standing on it.
Good luck, baby.
Don't save all your money in one place.
-Now we find the Well of the Madahar.
-Look!
Look, there it is!
-Oh, master, l am saved!
-Look.
Oh, no!
What's the matter?
l tried to stamp my foot and look.
lt's getting faster.
-What did you say about a minaret?
-The Minaret of the Rising Sun.
You must face it when you repeat the sacred words.
All right.
Let's look for that.
And hurry.
Jeannie.
Wait!
There it is!
See it now?
-Yeah, yeah.
-lt is the tall one.
Quickly now.
Point your right arm toward the minaret -palm upward.
-Yeah.
Take your left hand and put it under your right elbow.
-Right.
-No, palm upward also.
lt is good luck.
Do as they do.
lt must be a native custom.
-Lift your left leg from the ground.
-Right.
l say, miss.
l've a game left leg.
Rugger at Cambridge.
Would the right one do?
No, these are new Canadian Air Force exercises.
You and your native customs.
We had to come -Okay, now, master.
-All right, just a-- l'm terribly sorry, sir.
Come on, Jeannie.
Do we really have to do this?
Oh, yes, master.
Ramdah commands it.
Thanks.
Here.
Now repeat these words.
-Bottle to genie.
-Bottle to genie.
-Genie to master.
-Genie to master.
-Master to Mecca.
-Master to Mecca.
-Ramdah!
-Ramdah?
-lt is not working.
-l'll try again.
See, perhaps the sacred place is a few steps to the left.
-Yeah.
-Okay.
Good show.
l say, is this baseball?
Do you mind?
Bottle to genie, genie to master, master to Mecca.
No.
l think it's a little farther.
Toward this building.
Okay.
Bottle to genie-- Yes.
Yes, this is it.
Now, eight steps to the east.
Eight steps to the east?
lt's in this bank.
And it's closed.
Can't we do this some other place?
No, master.
This is the only place.
What are we going to do?
We're gonna break into the First National Bank of Mecca.
How are we gonna get in?
l will open the door from the inside, master.
Well, try again.
Let's hurry it up.
l've never broken into a bank before.
l'm a little nervous.
Jeannie, wait.
Wait, Jeannie.
Wait.
Where do l stand?
Over here.
l think.
You think?
What do you mean, you think?
l'm sure this is the place.
You can see the Minaret of the Rising Sun through that window.
Yeah, yeah.
Let's get it over with.
-Bottle to-- -No coaching.
Bottle to genie, genie to master -Master.
-master to Mecca.
-This is the wrong place.
-Would you make up your mind.
l cannot help it.
lt has been so long.
And there was a well around here.
Well, it's probably under the floor by now.
-But where?
-Well, l don't know where!
We haven't got time to start digging!
Pick a spot!
-Here.
This is the place!
-You're sure?
Positive.
Well, l feel it.
l feel it.
You know what l think?
l think the police are here.
Get us out.
Oh, master, it is too late.
My power is gone.
Your power is gone.
Yeah.
Your power's gone.
Come on, let's go.
Master, look!
There is the Minaret of the Rising Sun.
We've been looking at the Minaret of the Setting Sun.
-Quick, do the incantation.
-All right, now, cut it out!
We haven't got time.
The police are here.
-Master?
-What?
l cannot make it.
But you go ahead.
Jeannie, l can't leave without you.
All right.
l'll give it another try.
Bottle-- Bottle to genie, genie to master-- -Don't move.
-l'll be right with you.
-Master to Mecca, Ramdah-- -Stop, or l'll shoot!
-You search her.
-Hey, hey, hey.
Quickly!
My horoscope foretold a lucky day for me today.
Oh, let me tell you about mine.
Quiet!
l shall probably be made a lieutenant for this.
-Perhaps even a captain.
-Good, good-- Capturing two dangerous bank robbers red-handed.
We're not bank robbers.
No, no.
We're here on a pilgrimage.
You see, this is the day of the Ram, and that young lady there is a genie.
l found her when my capsule went down on this island-- Well, you're from this part of the world.
l hardly need tell you about genies.
Pretending insanity will not help you.
You will be shot!
Take him to the car.
Wait a minute.
Jeannie, do something!
l'm sorry, master.
l am finished.
-Forgive me.
-But what will happen to you?
l will go back into limbo.
Goodbye, master.
l love you.
-Jeannie!
-What is she doing?
-She's escaping, that's what.
-Stop!
There's only one way to stop her.
Watch this.
Bottle to genie.
Genie to master.
Master to Mecca.
Ramdah!
Oh, master, you have done it!
Get us out of here, Jeannie.
Enough of this trickery.
Come along.
Where would you like to go, master?
Dr. Bellows' office.
How long have you had this dream that you're a camel?
For years.
Sometimes l'm a one-hump camel and other times l'm a two-hump camel.
And how do you feel when you wake up?
-Thirsty.
-Am l late?
Oh.
l didn't hear you come in.
l'm afraid l won't have time to see you, Captain Nelson.
l wanna put my notes together on Captain Healey's case.
Captain Healey's case?
He's been telling me the most fascinating case history l've heard.
l'm glad you enjoyed it, doc.
l guess l'll be running along.
Fine.
Plan to spend every evening next week with me.
Every evening of the next week?
What for, sir?
We're gonna begin psychoanalysis.
Psychoanalysis?
l don't need psychoanalysis.
l'm as normal as apple pie.
Ask anyone.
Captain Healey, when a man wakes up in the middle of night and goes climbing trees in his pyjamas when he feels a compulsion to try to communicate with bees and when he has a recurring dream that he's a thirsty camel that man needs psychoanalysis.
Well, gosh, Roge.
l'm sorry.
l had no idea.
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait-- What are you--?
-You don't believe l really-- -Really what, captain?
Nothing, sir.
How long will this analysis take?
lf everything goes well, about three years.
What if l told you l made it up?
Then l'd say about five years.
Do a friend a favour, huh?
Roge, where are you going?
l'm going to put on my pyjamas and go climb a tree!
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Ready?
Yes, master.
Hey.
Well, well, well.
Do l please thee?
lf it took 2000 years for you to look like that it was worth every day.
You saved my life today.
Thank you.
Well, you've saved my life often enough.
l guess we're even.
Where shall we go to dinner tonight?
l know!
l will take you to Paris!
No, no, no, thank you.
l've had enough travelling for one day.
l'm gonna take you to dinner.
ln Cocoa Beach?
Anything you say, master.
Okay.
Let's go.
Oh, Jeannie, l forgot.
My car's in the shop.
-l'll call a cab.
-Oh, do not bother, master.
Oh, Jeannie, it's not happening all over again.
Oh, no, master.
But on a night like this with a moon l thought it would be more romantic.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Jeannie, you better knock off the housework.
Roger's on his way over here.
-We're gonna do a little work upstairs.
-Oh, good.
Captain Healey is such a nice man.
Yes.
Yes, he is.
But l don't want him to catch you here.
lf he ever found out you were a genie, he'd-- That's Captain Healey's car outside.
ln the bottle please, miss.
Come on, come on, come on.
Thank you.
Oh, hi, Roge.
-Sweeping.
-l was doing a little housecleaning.
You don't know of a good detective agency, do you?
No.
What do you want a detective agency for?
l wanna hire them to help me find Jeannie.
-Roge, you can't do that.
-That's the only way l'll find her.
l spent three hours in front of the library last night hoping she'd turn up.
Boy, she makes every other woman l ever met look like nothing.
Roger, l think you're carrying this a little too far.
Why, she's just another girl.
Yeah, but she's the only girl l ever wanted to marry.
Yeah, hello?
Oh, yes, sir.
Yeah.
l have them here.
All right, l'll bring them right down.
That was Colonel Pollock.
They moved the launch up and they wanna see the revised pages on this.
l'll be about 20 minutes.
You make yourself at home.
-No rush.
l'll just read a magazine.
-Okay.
Bye-bye.
See you later.
Gesundheit.
Must be one of those musical bottles.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
l've been looking everywhere for you!
l've been looking all over for you!
And all the time you were right here in the bottle!
-Where are we?
-Captain Healey?
-Don't tell me.
-Oh, now, do not be afraid.
-l will not harm you.
-Who's afraid?
l've been looking everywhere for you.
l was going to get a private detective.
l heard you when l was in the bottle.
Oh, that's wonderful.
You heard me when you were in the bottle.
Please do not keep doing that, Captain Healey.
Are you all right?
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
Tell you the truth, l'm not sure.
Either you just came out of that bottle, or l've lost my mind.
Now, do not be frightened.
l am a genie.
Captain Nelson rescued me from my bottle on an island in the Pacific.
You mean, when he made that emergency landing?
Yes.
That is when he found me.
What a shock that must've been.
Did he faint?
-No.
-No, huh?
Well, you don't have to mention that l. Oh, of course not.
So Tony knew about you all this time?
-Oh, yes.
-Sure kept it a secret.
Well, l'm sure he did not wish to worry you.
Yeah.
Boy, what a pal.
All this time stuck with a genie, and he never.
Well, what--?
What is it you do exactly?
Oh, anything my master wishes.
Gee, that's-- That's too bad.
Because, you know, anything, that's.
Any-- You mean all Tony has to do is make a wish, and he gets it?
Yes.
-Anything?
-Yes.
Why, that dirty double-crosser.
All the time he's had you and didn't offer to share with me?
l told you he did not wish to get anyone into trouble.
ls that what he told you?
Well, don't believe him.
He's a miser!
He wants to keep the cars, beautiful girls and gold to himself.
Oh, he did not ask for any cars or gold or beautiful girls.
You mean to tell me he didn't ask for a single thing?
No, he did not wish for any of those things.
Well, then l take it back.
He's not a miser.
He's stupid!
Do you know what this means?
l can rule the world, single-handed!
-How?
-How?
Didn't you say you could do anything?
Well, yes, but only for my master and you are not my master.
Guess l can't force you.
lt's.
l obey only the person who controls the bottle.
Yeah, that's right.
Only the person that-- How do you get in and out of that thing anyway?
Oh, simple.
l will show you.
Say hello to your new master, Jeannie.
You can roll up your sleeves.
We're going to live a little.
Oh, no.
No.
Thou must not do this.
Let me out of here.
Let me out of here.
Sorry l took so long.
Hope you weren't bored.
Not a bit.
Time flew.
l guess l'll be running along.
We were gonna go over the flight plan.
Well, not today.
l'm busy.
See you tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
What do you mean, tomorrow?
Jeannie, hi-- Jeannie.
-Roger!
Give me that bottle back.
-What bottle?
This is nothing to fool around with.
There was a bottle and it's gone.
And l want it back right now.
Do l look like the kind of guy that goes around stealing bottles?
You mean you didn't?
Oh, Roger, l'm sorry if l accused you unjustly.
That's all right.
We all make mistakes.
-No hard feelings.
-Yeah.
lt's probably inside.
Yeah.
Hi, girls.
Home, Janice.
Hey.
Pardon me, where's Captain Healey?
He's gone.
He told us to take everything from his apartment.
He don't need it no more.
He even left his uniforms here.
He what?
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Get out of this car.
l'm terribly sorry.
l was looking for my bottle.
You all go on with what you were doing.
Excuse me, Dr. Bellows.
l'm looking for Captain Healey.
-You haven't seen him?
-No.
Did you look in his office?
No.
That's the last place he'd be.
He didn't drop in to say goodbye?
Goodbye?
ls he going away?
He's already gone.
l don't understand again.
Sit down, captain.
l'm sorry, sir.
l don't have time.
l've gotta catch him before it's too late.
-Too late?
For what?
-To avert a disaster.
You haven't seen a Rolls Royce with a beautiful chauffeur and footman?
No.
-Have you?
-Yes, sir.
Well, that's very interesting.
Why don't you lie down there on the couch and tell me.
lt's not my car.
lt's Captain Healey's.
You think Captain Healey has gone off in the black Rolls Royce with the beautiful chauffeur and footman?
Or in one of his private planes.
Excuse me, sir.
l've gotta catch him before it's too late.
That's great.
A little bit higher though, huh?
Yes, master.
Oh, this is marvellous.
Shut the door, will you?
There's a little draft up here.
-Ex-master.
-Hey, watch it.
-That's my genie.
-Oh, no, it's not your genie.
-She belongs to me.
-Guess again.
l've got the bottle.
As long as l've got the bottle, that's my genie.
l'll get down now.
Oh, boy.
What a crazy upper berth.
Roger, you and l are gonna have a little talk.
Oh, well, what's there to talk about?
What's there to talk about?
You stole my genie.
Temper, temper.
l didn't steal her.
l found her.
Remember the old rule, finders keepers?
You found her on the beach, and l found her on your coffee table.
-lt was my coffee table.
-Well, fair is fair.
You can have the coffee table.
Roger, l don't think you know what you're in for.
Watch it.
Watch it.
That's ltalian silk.
Wrinkles easy.
-Sorry.
-Wanna see something?
My new watch.
A little present from Jeannie.
l think there are little men inside making the wheels go around.
May l please go back with Captain Nelson?
ln a word, no.
-Where did he put the bottle?
-l do not know.
l'm glad you two asked that.
Watch this.
Happens to be in my lovely safe here, with a 1 2-digit combination.
And l will-- Oh, l should be mad at you.
Fun and games with Jeannie, and you didn't let me in on them.
-Oh, naughty, naughty.
-Fun and games?
l almost got tossed out of the space program because of Jeannie.
Dr. Bellows watches every move l make.
One false step and l'm washed out.
One false step and you're washed out.
Oh, he is right.
l am a big burden.
Well, l've got big shoulders.
Roger, how much does the space program mean to you?
-lt means everything to me.
-Then get rid of Jeannie.
Not a chance.
l'm going to keep her.
But you can borrow her sometime if you'd like.
-Jeannie, back in the bottle, huh?
-Oh, master.
'' Master.
'' Doesn't that sound beautiful?
Back into the bottle.
Naughty, naughty.
Well, l hate to leave you here but l got business to take care of.
l bought a seat on the stock exchange and l'm going down to see how the market's doing.
See you later.
Jeannie, can you hear me?
Jeannie?
l'm gonna get you out of there somehow.
Oh, l hope so, master.
Roger should never have done that to you.
He shouldn't have locked you in there.
Well, he doesn't understand you the way l do, Jeannie.
All he thinks of you is something to use.
But you're more than that.
You're warm and sensitive and beautiful.
-And l love you.
-Have you been in love with that safe long, Captain Nelson?
Dr. Bellows.
Are you engaged or just going together?
-No, it's just a safe.
You see, l was-- -lt's a beautiful, warm -and sensitive safe, isn't it?
-l know it must seem peculiar-- Well, why would it seem peculiar?
l know a boy who swears he saw you floating in the air.
You carry on conversations with your walls and your vacuum cleaner.
So why shouldn't you be in love with the safe?
Well, l really must admire your sense of humour, sir.
l've gotta catch Captain Healey.
lf you'll excuse me there's something very important l've gotta-- Hello.
This is Dr. Alfred Bellows speaking.
Does Captain Healey live here?
Captain Healey?
Gina.
Captain Healey is by the pool.
This way, please.
Yes?
Roger?
Oh, hi, Tony.
That'll be all, Helga.
Just remember where you left off, huh?
-What did she say?
-l say l will be ready when he wants me.
Tony, it's good to see you.
l was just thinking about you.
Oh, when would you find the time?
-How's Jeannie?
-Fine, fine, fine.
May l see her?
l suppose there's no harm in that.
l've got the bottle safely tucked away.
Jeannie?
-Hello, old master.
-Hello, old Jeannie.
-How art thou?
-Fine.
Bit lonely.
How's Captain Healey treating you?
Oh, he's.
l have never worked so hard in my whole life.
You should see the villa for me in the French Riviera.
Twenty-five rooms.
Beautiful, beautiful, beau-- Hey, you're invited to be my guest.
Thanks a million, Roge.
You can come over in my yacht.
lt's bigger than Onassis'.
How are you gonna explain this?
As long as l do my work, Dr. Bellows won't mind my living comfortably.
l mean, Tony, nothing is going to stand in the way of my job.
l wouldn't give that up for anything in the world.
You wouldn't, huh?
l've worked all my life to become an astronaut.
You know how l feel about it.
lt means everything to me.
That's the nicest thing l ever heard, Roge.
Say, you know, l think this life suits you.
-l've never seen you look better.
-Really?
Oh, boy, you and this house and this pool and the servants.
l'd like to have a picture of it, Roge, to remind me of the real you.
Well, that's no problem.
Jeannie?
Hey, thanks, Roge.
Gee, l'm touched, really.
l'm so glad there are no hard feelings.
Why should there be any hard feelings?
You let me keep the coffee table.
That was funny, wasn't it?
Yeah.
Yeah, funny.
Well, l better be getting back to the base.
Must you leave?
l'm afraid so, Jeannie.
l have a feeling l'll be seeing you soon.
Oh, l hope so, old master.
Captain Nelson is such a wonderful man.
Yeah, he's not only a wonderful man but he's a wonderful man with something crooked up his sleeve.
l wonder what he wanted that picture for.
Come in.
Reporting for duty, sir.
You and Captain Healey are due for the pressure-chamber experiment at 2:30.
-Yes, sir.
-Where's Captain Healey?
Oh, he's gonna be a little late.
lt takes quite a time to finish a 1 5-course luncheon.
Captain Healey is having a 1 5-course luncheon?
Yes.
Well, lying around your pool all day, you work up quite an appetite.
Sir, l must say it's doing him a world of good.
Looks marvellous, doesn't he?
Where was this taken?
Oh, at Captain Healey's house.
lt's a quaint little place, isn't it?
Captain Healey is assigned to the.
Project Gamma.
Yeah, it's very hush-hush.
l suppose there's plenty of countries that would pay a fortune for information on Operation Gamma.
Captain Nelson.
Did you ever find Captain Healey's black Rolls Royce with the beautiful chauffeur and the beautiful footman?
Oh, yes, yes.
lt was on its way to take Captain Healey to his yacht.
His yacht?
Roger claims that his yacht is larger than Onassis'.
You know how he's always kidding around.
May l?
-May l keep this?
-Oh, certainly, sir.
Roger's probably back at his office now.
l'll go pick him up.
Give me General Peterson.
Hi, Roge.
How was lunch?
Paradise.
Just paradise.
You should have stayed.
Had roast pheasant, a whole leg of lamb, plover eggs.
l haven't eaten that much since breakfast.
l wouldn't be worried if he wasn't working on Operation Gamma.
But when he starts throwing money-- You psychiatrists are always looking into dark corners.
You'll find Captain Healey has a perfectly reasonable explanation.
-An uncle died and left him money.
-l hope not, sir.
-What?
-According to our records Captain Healey doesn't have an uncle.
l'm having a little party tonight, you know, just a hundred people.
l thought you could be there.
Just a 20-course dinner.
Wait a minute, on second thought, let's make it a 30-course dinner.
You've sure been a sport about this whole thing.
ls there anything l can do for you?
A palace in the Mediterranean?
A fleet of airplanes?
A harem?
Your own army?
Nothing's too good for you.
You name it.
What would you like?
You're never gonna get away with this.
-l never would have believed it.
-What are you gonna do?
l'm putting Captain Healey under arrest for high treason.
General Peterson.
General.
Colonel.
Oh, l didn't realize it was so late, sir.
We better be getting over-- l wouldn't let you near that pressure chamber!
l'm sorry, sir.
What did you say?
ls that a picture of your home?
Nothing wrong with a little gracious living.
Where did you get the money to buy that house?
Where did l get the money to buy the house?
And the black Rolls Royce with the beautiful chauffeur -and the beautiful footman?
-And the maids at the house.
And the maids at the house.
Well, l don't know where to begin.
A confession now will save you a lot of time and trouble.
Did a foreign power pay you for information on Operation Gamma?
Foreign power?
Do you think l took money?
Have you made a mistake.
l'd like to see your faces when you find out the truth.
What is the truth?
Well, the truth, sir is l'd like to see my lawyer.
Consider yourself under office arrest!
l don't want you to go outside of this room till the MPs arrive!
l'm sorry, Captain Healey.
Tony, they're gonna shoot me.
Yeah.
Why didn't you tell them the truth, Roge?
For the same reason you didn't.
We'd be washed out of the program.
Dr. Bellows isn't about to okay a couple of astronauts who has genies hanging around.
Well, you've got to help me.
l don't know what l can do.
lt's your problem.
But you're my buddy.
Share and share alike?
You're offering me half a firing squad?
Oh, what a spot l'm in.
lf l don't tell them where l got the money, bang.
l have firing squad all the way.
And if l tell them, l'm washed out.
-You've gotta help me.
-Well, l don't know what l can do.
-l've got a heavy schedule.
l gotta-- -Wait, wait, wait.
lf you help me this one time, l'll get you anything.
-Jeannie?
-Jeannie?
You want her after all the trouble she's caused?
After all the trouble she's caused?
You're the one that caused trouble.
l tried to tell you that.
Of course l want her back.
And you'll get me off the hook?
-Yeah, l can get you off the hook.
-Oh, it's a deal.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
-l don't know how to thank you, buddy.
-Always glad to do a buddy a favour.
-l'm officially turning her over to you.
-And l'm officially accepting.
All right, Jeannie.
Come on out.
Oh, master.
Hello, old master.
Not so loud.
You're all his now.
Oh, l know.
Well, l filled my end of the bargain, now you fulfil yours.
Oh, Jeannie.
Thanks.
-Well?
-That's it.
That's it?
That's it?
That's what?
You said she was gonna get me out of trouble.
-General Peterson.
-Well, are you gentlemen ready?
-Yes, sir.
We're just on our way.
-The experiment's at 2:30.
-You better hurry.
-We'll be on time.
Carry on.
Carry on?
What happened?
They didn't mention anything about arresting me.
Oh, Roger, l'm sorry.
l forgot to tell you.
Among Jeannie's many accomplishments is the fact that she's able to change time.
They won't have any recollection of what went on a couple of minutes ago.
That's wonderful.
Wait a minute.
l could've done that myself.
l mean, l didn't need you to-- What's gonna happen when they see my house and my cars again?
You won't have to worry about that.
When she wiped out their memory, she also wiped out your house and your villa and your car and your yacht.
And your suit.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Drink up, and old Roge'll open up another bottle of champagne.
lt's almost 3:00 in the morning.
ln China, it's noon.
We're not in China.
However, my uncle just may send you there if you don't get me home.
He's gonna be furious.
Don't panic, darling.
Doesn't he know you're out with me?
That's why he's gonna be furious.
-Did you like the scampi?
-lt was divine.
lt was nothing.
l didn't know you liked to fool around in the kitchen.
With a little encouragement l can be a lot of fun in the living room too.
lt is exactly 3:04.
l'll tell you what, darling.
One more sip and then-- Then l'll take you home, okay?
-Okay.
-One more sip?
One more.
One more sip.
Don't go away.
Hey, Jeannie.
Hey, Jeannie, everything's working out great.
Jeannie, you can come out now.
Tony, Tony.
What were you doing in the bottle?
-l sent Jeannie home.
-Not so loud.
-You can't.
l'm not through with her.
-Oh, yes, you are.
When l said you could borrow her, l didn't know what she was in for.
Look, you haven't given her a moment's rest.
Maybe l did get a little carried away, but l've never had a 24-course meal.
Tomorrow l'll have her do a cheese sandwich.
Forget it, Roge.
Forget it.
l mean the party's over.
You see, l'm not loaning Jeannie to you anymore.
lf there's one thing--!
lf there's one thing l can't stand it's a selfish astronaut.
What if l found her in that bottle on the beach?
Good night, Roge.
l'll let myself out the back way.
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Someone's got to set Dr. Bellows' clock back three hours.
Jeannie was gonna set it back for me.
-You know what?
-What?
You got big problems, buddy.
Jeannie's asleep.
Good night.
You're doing fine, Captain Healey, just fine.
Now, shall we try it again?
lf the big hand is pointing straight up and the little hand is pointing out that way, what time is it?
-Three o'clock, sir.
-Right you are.
And would you believe it, my watch looked just like this when you brought my niece home last night.
Yes, sir, but l can explain that, sir.
l issued a directive last week in regard to a voluntary curfew for all astronauts.
To facilitate certain tests, and to safeguard your health l asked you gentlemen to be in by 1 1 p.m. Why did you ignore the directive?
Well, you see, your niece and l were involved in a heated discussion.
Only three guesses per astronaut.
Yes, sir.
Blatant disobedience.
No excuse, sir.
Concise, to the point, and right on target.
Captain, l've decided that you need a vacation.
Vacation, sir?
Well, you're very kind, sir but l've got a lot of work piled up and l really-- Take it along with you.
lt'll give you something to do for the next 30 days.
Have l decided where l'm going on my vacation, sir?
lndeed you have.
You're headed for Andromeda lnlet.
Andromeda lnlet?
Anyway, that's what Dr. Bellows says.
l can't even find it.
Well, it's a remote island somewhere in the Celebes.
l'm serving 30 days as a lone Army observer in the Navy's Neptune Project.
-Unless.
-Forget it.
Forget it.
Jeannie is not gonna help you.
Be reasonable.
One blink and Dr. Bellows would change his mind.
-You've gotta ask her to help me out.
-Roger, she's worn out.
l don't even let her help me.
l forgot my briefcase and l'm gonna go back myself and pick it up.
You forgot your briefcase, master.
Oh, Jeannie, you didn't have to do that.
You better rest.
But while you're here, l have a little problem.
Dr. Bellows is going to send me away.
Oh, that is terrible.
You see?
She understands.
May l help your unfortunate friend?
My unfortunate friend has to learn to help himself.
And that's final, Roge.
No, if he wants any more magic, he'll have to find his own genie.
Oh, that is an excellent idea, master.
May l summon my cousin Marilla?
-Who?
-My cousin Marilla.
She was a genie when l left Baghdad 2000 years ago.
Oh, l'm sure she would love to serve Captain Healey.
-Marilla?
My own genie?
-No.
No, Roger, no.
How long would it take her to get here if she hopped on a rug?
-Oh, it would take her no time at all.
-Roger, l said no and l mean no.
All we need is another one running around.
One genie in Cocoa Beach is quite enough.
Master, if l may not help him may l please ask you to help him?
Jeannie, look, l don't want to have to-- Well, maybe l was a little too rough on him, huh?
Okay, l'll fix it.
Alrighty.
Hello.
Dr. Bellows, please.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
This is Captain Nelson here.
Yes, l wonder if you could do me a little favour, sir.
There we are.
l'll be gone for about a month, Mr. Billings.
l'd sure appreciate it if you'd keep things straightened up here.
No trouble at all, captain.
Would you mind feeding my fish?
You know, changing the water.
Captain Healey, you're talking to an American citizen, right?
-Right.
-What kind of a patriot -says no to an astronaut?
-Thank you very much, Mr. Billings.
Well, don't forget to take care of the fish.
l gotta go over to the base and check out.
Well, this is the apartment.
Right.
This place is gonna work out great.
Oh, well, l'll say.
We'll rehearse all week, get the act in shape and then maybe we can get some bookings.
Oh, l meant to tell you.
Watch the pigeons and the rabbits when you open the front door.
-Why?
-Well, the owner don't allow -pets in the building.
-We'll be quiet as mice.
Good.
Good.
And if you need anything, holler.
Arnie, do you still cut Myrt in half with the band saw?
Oh, yeah.
That's our flash finish.
Well, if you try it out up here make sure the shades are pulled down, will you?
Well, it's our joint for 30 days.
Let's say we open the trunk.
Here's one.
My favourite trick.
Ladies and gentlemen, '' Magic Factory.
'' Hello?
What's the matter with this?
lt's all right.
lt worked this morning.
Get the-- Captain Healey, what are you doing here?
l came back to pick up some notes l forgot.
Oh, that's smashing, that's smashing.
That's great, great.
Marilla?
Marilla.
Jeannie, you did it.
You sent me Marilla.
You sent me Marilla and a-- And a friend.
You have my permission to speak.
Your na-- What's your name?
l'm kno-- l'm known as Abdul the Great.
-Very pleased to meet you, l'm sure.
-Nice meeting you.
-Do you mind if l just call you Abdul?
-No, no.
You can call me ''master.
'' -Master.
-Master.
Boy, oh, boy, am l glad to see you two.
You are?
You mean you aren't mad about us being here?
You'll let us stay here for the whole 30 days?
Thirty days?
l'm never gonna let you go.
Look, you two sure got here in a hurry.
You must've had that magic carpet opened full throttle all the way from Baghdad.
Well, have you--?
Have you talked to Jeannie yet?
-Jeannie?
-What do you call your cousin?
l call him Harry.
Harry.
l don't remember any Harry, but she sure thinks a lot of you.
She thinks you're one of the greatest in the business.
-She does?
-lf you're half the genie Jeannie is boy, l'm gonna be a happy astronaut.
You.
Look, you folks work the same way?
You know: ls that the way you do it?
ls?
ls that the way we do what?
l see l asked the wrong question, huh?
Okay?
Professional secret?
Don't ask me how to fly a space capsule l won't ask how you do your work.
ls that fair enough?
Oh, anything you say master.
'' Master.
'' '' Master.
'' You don't know what that word does for me.
-That makes me feel 1 2 feet tall.
-lt does?
And you just don't send that big man to Andromeda lnlet.
No, sirree.
Not when the little man who issues the orders is going to change his mind.
And that's exactly what you're gonna do for Dr. Bellows.
You better get on it.
The plane l won't be on leaves in half an hour.
Make yourself at home here, and if you have any questions l'll be over at Captain Nelson's, okay?
You two can just pop in.
l suppose it figures, doesn't it?
-What does?
-Well a fella walks all those miles out in space something's gotta happen, isn't it?
l'll get it.
Yes?
Oh, hi, Roge.
Good morning.
Good morning.
There's the little old miracle worker.
Oh, what is this?
A little token of my appreciation.
Boy, you really go all out.
l asked for one and she sends two.
-Two what?
-Abdul the Great, and l mean great.
Boy, you should see him.
Well, l'd like to.
What does he do?
Well, l don't know what his specialty is.
He's kind of an all-around man.
-A handyman.
-l suppose you could say that.
Oh, Jeannie, do you mind?
-Thank you.
-Boy, l can't wait to see Abdul do that.
What are you talking about?
-Oh, Dr. Bellows.
-Oh, excuse me.
l saw Captain Healey's car outside and l-- Captain Healey.
l wanted to give you the good news myself.
You're not sending me away, right?
That's right.
l've decided that you're needed here.
And this decision came as quite a surprise to you, didn't it?
Roge, you're feeling all right?
l never felt better in my life.
Look, don't worry about a thing.
You won't have any trouble with me because l won't have any trouble with you.
Right?
Okay?
Because all you need is the right friends, right?
Right.
l'll say hello to your niece for you and say goodbye to you know what.
Goodbye.
You know, l'm really worried about Roger.
He's acting like a wild man.
You hear him tell Dr. Bellows off this morning?
He sounds as if he's got you behind him.
He sounds-- Jeannie, you're not helping Roger, are you?
Of course not, master.
l promised that l would not.
All right.
l better give him a call.
Oh, thanks.
l could've done that, you know.
Hello.
-Who's this?
-This is My-- Marilla.
ls this you, master?
ls this me, master?
Jeannie.
Jeannie, you lied to me.
Oh, but l do not lie.
Hey, are you there?
Who is it, Myrt?
l don't know.
They won't answer.
l have your cousin on the phone.
-You want to talk to her?
-My cousin?
-Yeah, you know, Marilla.
Remember?
-But l did not-- Hello.
Marilla?
Yeah, this is Marilla.
Who's this?
Well, this is your cousin Jeannie.
l got another one of them.
Hello, Jeannie.
lt's been a long time.
How's the family?
How did you get here?
l came with Abdul.
Oh, Marilla has brought a friend with her.
-By flying carpet.
-Oh, she came by flying carpet.
Jeannie, we're getting out of here.
-But l did not-- -Come on.
They hung up.
Boy, we've really landed in a den of kooks.
Come on, better get dinner ready.
Are you sure this is all right with my uncle?
Listen, you leave your little old uncle to me.
l've planned a meal tonight that just won't stop.
Pottage oriental, pheasant, truffles, baba rum.
Smell that?
lt smells like something's burning.
But that's impossible.
l've hired two of the greatest chefs in the world.
Abdul and Marilla.
They wouldn't know how to burn anything if they tried.
Excuse me a minute.
-Hey, wait, what's going on out here?
-Oh, hiya, master.
-We're cooking.
-What is it, old shoe?
lt smells terrible.
Sorry, l thought you'd like it.
l hate to offend you, Marilla.
lt's just when Jeannie cooks everything seems to come out so great.
Oh, you mean my cousin Jeannie?
Maybe this isn't what you do best.
Do you have some specialty?
-Oh, yes.
-Now we're getting somewhere.
-What is it?
-Sawing people in half.
We'll eat in 1 0 minutes.
lt won't be ready for two hours, master.
Dinner won't be ready for a couple of hours.
l guess they're on Baghdad time out there.
l promised my uncle l'd be home early tonight.
l told you not to worry about your uncle.
-Well, he's been a bit edgy lately.
-How can you tell?
He's up for a promotion.
You-- You mean they're-- They're gonna send him away?
No, he was to be head of the Medical Department but he doesn't think he'll get it.
Some machine in Washington decides who's right for the job.
He's jumpy because he thinks he won't get the job?
-That's right.
-And if he gets the job he'll be mellow and get off my back?
He's already heard that he's not gonna get it.
Sheila?
There are not too many people l can tell but l'm probably as influential as anyone here on Cocoa Beach.
Twice as influential.
Your uncle wants that job l'm going to give it to him.
-You're gonna give it to him?
-l mean l'm going to see that he gets it.
You know someone that could help?
You.
You might say that.
You're marvellous.
l won't argue with that.
Look, little one, if you could have anything in the world you wanted what would you choose?
Oh, l don't know.
l've always wanted a mink coat.
You got it.
-What do you mean, l've got it?
-Just what l say.
lt's yours.
Just like that?
Don't get me wrong.
No strings attached.
lt's just that l have this thing about wanting to see pretty girls happy.
You're a pretty girl, you got a mink coat, it's yours and now you're a happy pretty girl.
Roger!
Roger!
Roger, open up!
l know you're in there.
lt's my other influential friend.
Excuse me.
Tony.
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
Captain Nelson, this is Dr. Bellows' niece.
-Hello.
-And this is his friend Jeannie.
-Where is she?
-Where's who?
-Marilla.
Marilla.
-Oh, what a treasure.
l can't thank you enough.
-So you didn't bring her here, huh?
-Well, l told you l did not.
She came by flying carpet.
This is some kind of wartime code, isn't it?
-lt's wartime, all right.
-Marilla?
They're calling us again.
Boy, they sure expect a lot of service for a free month's rent.
For two cents l'll tell him to take his apartment-- Let's humour him a little bit, huh?
l'm sick and tired of sleeping on the beach.
Honestly, l don't know.
You called, master?
How about that?
She can't cook as well-- But she is not my cousin.
l don't care if she is, she's marvellous.
Jeannie, l want you to get rid of them right away.
Hold it!
Sheila, l decided we're going out for dinner tonight.
-Wait in the car.
-Good night, all.
Now, just a minute.
Those are my two genies you're trying to get rid of.
Now, if they stay around here, we'll all get in trouble.
Wait, how come you can have a genie and l can't have one?
What are you, some kind of lndian genie giver?
You gave me two.
l like them and l'm keeping them.
-l did not send them.
-You keep out.
Wait, you're forgetting one thing.
l have two genies and you got one.
lf you don't behave, l'll take yours away.
-Yeah?
Try it.
-Go ahead, blink her out.
Blink her out.
Blink her out?
Give her the old ''one, two, three.
'' Yeah, well, saved by the phone.
Hello.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
How are you?
Yeah, Sheila's here.
What time will I have her home?
l don't know, 3 in the morning, -lt depends on my mood.
-Are you sure this is Captain Healey?
Yes, and little old Captain Healey has got news for you.
l decided to make you head of the Medical Department.
You've decided to make me head of the Medical Department?
-That's right, doc.
-What do you think you're doing?
Look, you'll have confirmation tomorrow at.
Would 1 0:00 in the morning be all right?
Yeah, it's fine with me.
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning, doc.
l just made Dr. Bellows a very happy man.
And l decided to let you keep your genie.
The least l can do for my best friend.
Abdul, Marilla, give them my dinner.
See you tomorrow morning.
Come on, we're getting out of here before they bring on Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves.
Blink her out?
That is not Marilla.
l don't care.
You're the only one that could've brought her here.
lf you think l'm gonna stand by and allow this to happen-- ''Abdul the Great and Company''?
That's right, mate.
l thought show business was wacky.
You've got us topped.
Come on, Myrt.
-You're not genies, then?
-Are you kidding, sweetie?
l don't even know what you're talking about.
Will you tell your friend thanks for the use of the hall?
Bye.
Bye.
Well, master?
l'm very sorry, Jeannie.
l-- l thought they were real genies.
That's what Roger thought.
And that is why he acted so strangely.
Oh, what will happen when he learns the truth?
l think he might spend about five years in a place called Andromeda lnlet.
A long rest is indicated, captain and that's just what you're going to get.
l feel fine, sir.
l just made a little mistake.
Captain do you know what megalomania is?
Not exactly, sir.
lt's when you tell me that you're making me head of the Medical Department at 1 0:00.
You see, l happen to know that l've already been rejected.
Come in.
Excuse me.
These orders came through for you.
-l thought you might like to see them.
-Thank you.
And congratulations, sir.
-Congratulations?
-On being appointed the head of the Medical Department here.
Jeannie.
l don't know what to say.
-They told me l'd find you here.
-Sheila, where--?
-lsn't it beautiful?
-lt's beautiful.
-Captain Healey bought it for me.
-Are you prepared to pay for that coat?
-How much did it cost?
-Five thousand dollars.
Five thousand.
Five thousand dollars, at exactly $1 0 a week would make $1 00.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
What are you doing with this mummy case, master?
And where is the mummy?
This is a steamer trunk, Jeannie.
lt's used for travelling.
We are going on a journey!
Oh, master, what a wonderful surprise!
Oh, good, good.
l've got a bigger surprise for you.
You're not going.
-You're taking a journey without me?
-Yeah, that's right, Jeannie.
l'm sorry.
This is official business, and-- Well, the government's sending me to the lnternational Air Show in Rome.
-Rome?
-Yeah.
You probably knew it as ''Gaul.
'' Oh, it was divided into three parts.
Yeah, that's the place.
l want to go see the chariot races.
There's a new young driver they speak very highly of.
Ben Hur?
l keep forgetting.
You're not a kid.
-l may go?
-No, l'm afraid not.
lt's gonna be three weeks, what with the boat trip and all.
You're crossing the ocean by ship?
Yeah, l wanted to fly, but Dr. Bellows thought the ocean voyage would do me good.
Jeannie, what do you think you're doing?
Get this thing off of me.
Come on.
Master, you must not go.
Ships are not safe.
l was shipwrecked for 2000 years before you found me on that island and rescued me from my bottle.
Jeannie, you were travelling in little wooden boats.
l'm gonna be on a great big steel-hulled ship.
Must weigh 30,000 tons.
Thirty thou--?
Oh, that will go down even faster!
Oh, master, if you insist on risking your life this way l must go to protect you.
Jeannie, l don't need any protection.
l'm gonna be as safe as.
Well, l'll be as safe as that ship in that bottle.
-Dr. Bellows, morning.
-Good morning, Captain Nelson.
-You'll soon be off, won't you?
-l'm looking forward to my trip, sir.
Not as much as l am, captain.
Not as much as l am.
Yeah.
-Hi, Roge.
-Tony, Tony.
-Where is she?
-Where's who?
Where's who?
-Where's who?
-You know who.
Jeannie.
Well, Roger, l don't carry her around in my pocket.
She's at home in her bottle.
Gee, that's wonderful.
Certainly glad you found her instead of me.
You really are?
l mean, a lot of guys would envy you, but not me.
You really know how to handle a situation like this.
Thanks, Roge.
l've got everything in life l need.
Well, l'm very glad to hear that.
l have a staff meeting.
l'll see you at lunch, huh?
Yeah.
Lunch.
Now, where was l in my little list?
Let's see, l had the new sofa, end table, lamps, colour TV.
How about a coloured TV for the bedroom?
Why not?
Colour TV for bedroom.
Gee, l. l wonder how she does that, anyway?
lt's just amazing.
lt's.
Captain Healey?
lt worked!
lt worked!
Thanks.
Now, blink-- Blink my heart out of my mouth.
-Did l just bring you here?
-No.
l came because l'm worried about my master and l need your help.
You need my help?
That's a switch.
You are my master's best friend.
You might say that.
We're buddies.
Then you must try to convince him that he must take me with him to Rome.
Take you to Rome?
-l'm sorry, Jeannie, l can't do that.
-But why not?
For two reasons: selfishness and greed.
l was hoping he'd lend you to me while he was away.
My master lend me to you?
Well, l lend him my golf clubs.
lt's only for a couple of weeks.
l thought we'd pick up a few knickknacks-- -Golf clubs?
-Rolls-Royce-- And you believed he would do this?
That he would pass my bottle from hand to hand as if it were a bottle?
-Well, it's only for a couple of-- -l mean, does he care so little for me?
Back home we have an old saying.
With someone like you for a friend, Captain Healey who needs an enemy?
lmagine that.
They had a Captain Healey back in those days.
l better make a note of that.
Keep bottle corked whenever possible.
Yeah?
Yes, Captain Nelson here.
Captain, this is Dr. Bellows.
A problem has arisen about your trip.
-About my trip, sir?
-Yes.
There's been a slight change in plans, captain.
What kind of change, sir?
You will be travelling by plane instead of by ship.
Well, just a minute ago you told me-- Never mind what I said a few minutes ago, captain.
I don't want you to go by boat.
-Understand?
-Yes, yes.
l understand, Dr. Bellows.
You don't want me to go by boat.
Who says l don't?
Well, you do, sir, or else l'd still be going.
Captain, to whom are you talking?
l'm talking to Dr. Bellows, Dr. Bellows.
-You're talking to me?
-Yes.
Well, it sounds like you.
Must be the wrong number.
l'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.
Yes.
l just came in to give you your ticket.
-Well, thank you, sir.
-Not at all, captain.
ln my opinion we can't get you on that boat a moment too soon.
Captain Healey.
-Well, what's bugging him?
-l am.
l was talking to him on the phone when he walked in.
You were?
Well, look, l'm gonna take you down to the boat.
l don't want anything to happen to you.
And don't worry about a thing while you're away.
l'll check your mail and take care of your laundry wash your car and, you know, things like that.
You want to give me the keys to your house?
That's very nice of you, Roge.
What do you want the keys for?
l thought l could water your plants and feed your parakeet.
l don't have a parakeet.
You do now.
Say hello to Seymour.
No.
You don't want to say hello to Seymour?
No, l don't want to give you the key to my house.
-And tell Jeannie it won't work.
-What won't work?
You had a talk with Jeannie about my trip, right?
A little talk, not too much-- And she asked you to talk me into taking her with me, right?
Well, she did mention it.
-But you wouldn't do it, would you?
-Of course.
We're buddies.
Well, forget it!
l did not send him.
Morning, Dr. Bellows.
That can't be Dr. Bellows.
He wears his hair shorter.
l'm sorry about tricking you.
Oh, no, no.
You're sorry your trick didn't work.
l am going on a boat l am going alone, and that's final.
Roger, would you please tell her that boats are safe.
Boats are safe.
There is the Titanic, the Lusitania, the Normandie.
Jeannie.
Oh, hi.
Say, would you hand me a pair of pliers?
There's a smaller pair over on top of the bookcase, please.
Thanks.
-How are you feeling, master?
-Fine.
Just great.
Never felt better.
Why?
Oh, l just wondered.
Now, Jeannie, don't try to outsmart me.
l feel wonderful, in great physical health and l'm gonna remain that way.
Of course, master.
l don't suppose it ever entered your mind that if l were ill or had an accident, l couldn't go to Rome.
Well, it did occur to me.
Jeannie, you wouldn't do that to me.
Promise me you-- What is a sprained ankle or an aching back if it saves your life?
No, you don't, young lady.
Where is that--?
Oh, here it is.
Swear you won't let anything that's in this book happen to me.
What is the book?
The Unabridged International Medical Encyclopaedia of Diseases, Accidents and Allergies.
Swear.
Thanks.
l think.
Oh, look, look.
This ought to convince you that the S.S. Sorrento is not a slave galley.
Here.
Look, look.
Here it is.
Jeannie.
Beautiful?
Well Oh, master, l would not worry so much if l could go with you.
Jeannie, l would love to take you with me.
Now, you know that.
l love having you around.
-Do you really?
-Of course l do.
Oh, you're lovely.
You're magic.
But l don't mean ''magic'' magic.
l mean, magic.
Oh, master.
l am so glad you are taking me with you.
l'm not.
You are leaving me here?
How would it look if l walked into the conference with a genie on my arm?
We've advanced quite a bit in research, but that's ridiculous.
-l say l will be there.
-And l say you won't.
And what power will you use to stop me?
The power l have up here.
You see, you're forcing me to do something l really don't wanna do.
-l'm gonna have to make a phone call.
-Whom are you calling?
l'm calling.
No.
On second thought, l will call from my bedroom.
Gotcha.
You tricked me!
Oh, l don't know.
lt doesn't exactly have your razzle-dazzle but it's not bad for a mortal like me.
Please let me out!
l'll let you out when l get back from Rome.
l'll write.
-Say, Tony, you got a minute?
-Sure.
l wanted to ask you a question.
Well, what's on your mind?
-Would you like a cup of coffee?
-No, no, thanks.
l really wanna get back to the office.
Got a million things to clean up before l leave.
Well, l bet Jeannie's really excited about the trip, huh?
Oh, well, Jeannie's not going.
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, l'm positive.
Why, l never thought you could do it.
You just have to be firm with her, that's all.
And a little sneaky.
What'd you want to ask me?
Roge, what'd you want to ask me?
l wanted to ask if you wanted a cup of coffee.
No.
No, thanks.
-l'll take a rain check, all right?
-Yeah.
Let me see.
Where was l?
New golf clubs.
Gotta get new golf clubs.
How about a cabin cruiser?
How about a 40-foot cabin cruiser?
How about a 50-foot cabin cruiser?
How about a 60-foot cabin cruiser?
l just came in to talk to you about your friend, Captain Healey.
-What's Roger done now?
-Well, l'm not quite sure.
There's something very peculiar going on.
Has he inherited a large sum of money recently?
No.
No, not that l know of.
Why?
He's started his own anti-poverty program here at the base.
-l beg your pardon?
-Well, it began this morning when reports began to trickle through that he'd given Bowens his television and Carruthers his hi-fi.
Well, he's a very generous man.
l'm sure there's some ex-- Then l heard about the gift he gave Lieutenant Lonsdale.
Lonsdale just got married, sir.
He's entitled to a little wedding present.
Three rooms of furniture?
-Three rooms of furniture?
-And his car.
His car?
He said he didn't need it anymore.
lt had a dented fender.
l think l have an idea what's happening to Captain Healey.
So have l. He's suffering from acute megalomania.
He needs an ocean voyage.
l want you to take him along with you.
That way you can keep an eye on each other.
Yes, well, l think that's a wonderful idea, sir.
Yeah, don't worry about Roger.
l'll watch out for him.
And of course you don't have to worry about me.
You know what l am.
l'm in deep trouble.
Captain, did you say you're in deep trouble?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
lf l-- lf l don't finish my reports before l leave, they won't let me go.
Thank you very much for dropping in, sir.
Jeannie, l think-- lf you don't mind.
-Who let you out of the bottle?
-Captain Healey.
Roger, the megalomaniac.
Because l love you, l will give you a choice.
Oh, thanks!
What kind of lap dog would you like to be?
l don't know.
What kind have you got?
-Wait.
You wouldn't do that to me.
-lt's the only way l can trust you.
-Now, you can't do that!
-Watch.
No, l mean, you can do that, but, well, you shouldn't.
You wouldn't be able to talk to me.
l would not be able to talk to you if you went to Rome without me.
Jeannie, that's blackmail!
lt's out and out blackmail!
lt is an ancient Carthaginian custom.
Okay, okay.
-All right, fine.
You can go.
-Oh, thank you, master!
Now, you go and get in your bottle and l'll take you with me.
Now, wait!
Now, look.
Please, be reasonable, will you?
-How you gonna go not in your bottle?
-As a woman.
An American woman.
Don't be ridiculous.
You'd never get away with it.
Hey.
Hey, you look beautiful.
-Thank you, master.
-No, l mean it.
You're the most beautiful genie a man ever had.
-Am l?
-Yeah.
But you can't go as a woman.
-A man?
-Jeannie, be reasonable.
You don't have a passport.
They won't even let you sail on the ship.
Oh, well, then l will get a passport.
No.
Tell you what, l'll make a deal with you.
lf you can get a passport-- And no magic.
--then we'll leave the bottle here.
But if you can't, you travel in the bottle.
lt is a deal.
Fine.
l'll- l'll drive you down to the passport office in Miami.
Well, that-- That certainly ought to impress them.
Thou art wonderful to help me, master.
lt's my pleasure.
There.
lt is finished.
You fill everything out?
Well, l ran out of spaces where it said '' list previous addresses'' so l just listed those places l lived until 200 A.D. Good, good.
That shows you're not trying to hide anything.
Oh, l'm sorry, Mrs. Medford you didn't fill in the back of the application.
Oh, dear.
Well, l'll be right back.
How these people ever find their way through Europe.
Well, good for you.
You've filled in both sides, huh?
We should have you processed in no time.
Birthplace, Babylon?
l'll fill in New York.
Mother, Fatima.
Father, Mustafa.
-Mustafa what?
-Mustafa the camel driver.
Yes, but what was his last name?
Oh, he did not need a last name.
Everyone in the village knew him.
Yes.
You know how popular local camel drivers are.
Well, if it will help, l have an old passport.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?
That'll be a great help.
Babylonian passport?
Oh, signed by King Nebuchadnezzar himself.
See?
lt is not valid for travel in Carthage, Phoenicia or North Mesopotamia.
lt's not valid here, either.
You'll have to present a birth certificate or bring someone who's known you for two years.
Oh, well, Captain Nelson knows me.
He will vouch for me.
-Oh, yes.
l'll vouch for her.
-Well, that's different.
How long have you known this young lady, captain?
-Six months.
-l'm afraid that won't do.
-But why not?
-l couldn't lie.
-He's a perfectly good friend.
-Jeannie, they have their rules.
-You knew about this.
-Yeah, Jeannie, look.
We tried, right?
Better luck next time.
Tell you what.
l'll phone the base, tell them l'll be late.
And then l'll take you out to dinner on the town.
Okay?
Bye.
Hi, beautiful.
Haven't we met somewhere before?
l do not think so.
Sure.
Atlantic City.
-You mean Atlantis?
-Sure.
Two years ago, sweetheart.
We were sweethearts two years ago?
-l remember it like it was yesterday.
-You're sure it was l?
-Baby, l'd swear to it.
-Thank you!
Sir, l have found an old friend who will swear he has known me for two years.
What is this?
You may be beautiful but you're not worth a federal perjury rap.
Forget it.
For an old friend, he was not very friendly, was he?
Seems to be more red tape in getting a passport these days.
lt wasn't like that in 1 931 .
Listen, you were so anxious to get out of Chicago after what happened that summer, you didn't notice the red tape.
l still get nightmares from it.
That rainy day, that car coming down the street gangsters shooting that barbershop, me right in the middle.
Why, l wouldn't be alive today if it wasn't for that brave girl risking her life by throwing me down on the sidewalk.
A regular Joan of Arc.
Did you ever find out who she was?
Never.
She saved my life and disappeared.
To this day, l couldn't tell you what she looked like but everything else is as vivid today as it was then.
lt's the strangest thing.
What?
l just relived that whole incident again.
For the first time l saw the face of the girl who saved my life.
She was blond and blue-eyed.
Very pretty.
That's her!
That's the girl who saved my life!
Well, you're the girl who saved my life!
Remember?
Thirty years ago?
Those gangsters?
-Dearborn Street?
-Of course!
ln front of the barbershop.
Oh, l knew l was right.
Oh, isn't this a thrill?
Why, you don't look a day older.
Oh, neither do you.
What are you doing here?
l'm trying to get a passport, but they insist on a witness who has known me for two years and l cannot think of anyone in town.
What about me?
You are sure you would not mind?
Mind?
l've been waiting 30 years to do something for you.
Come along.
Oh, it's you again.
l have brought an old friend.
Now, may l have my passport?
Not so fast.
-How long have you known this lady?
-Thirty years.
Thirty years?
May l have my passport now?
She saved my life in Chicago 30 years ago.
She saved your life in Chicago 30 years ago?
According to her application, she wasn't even born then.
-Well, she must have made a mistake.
-She must have.
May l have my passport now?
What is your friend's name?
-lt's-- -l asked her.
Johnny.
lt happens to be a federal offence to try to obtain a passport by fraudulent means.
l'm going to have to hold the both of you for federal-- Well, where did she go?
Well, l don't know.
Maybe back to Chicago.
Gonna give a cocktail party?
Good, good.
For the whole base?
You know what you're doing?
Well, l hope so.
Roger, l think somebody wants to use the phone.
Yeah, yeah.
l'll talk to you later.
-What happened?
-You won, master.
l did not get the passport, so l will go with you in the bottle.
Oh, that's wonderful, Jeannie.
Good girl.
-What's the matter?
-Oh, it is nothing.
l just saved a woman's life from some gangsters in Chicago.
Do you mind?
That'll do it.
Get new drapes.
Put a nice, long sofa here in front of the fireplace.
Coloured television right there.
lt's open!
Get rid of that picture.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Hey, hey, what's--?
What's going on around here?
l'm redecorating.
Yeah, but where's the furniture and the sofa and the-- Your dining room stuff?
l gave it all away.
Where's Jeannie?
l thought you said you were giving a farewell cocktail party for the whole base?
Oh, l am.
Are you kidding?
l've got Dr. Bellows, General Peterson.
All the brass are coming.
This is gonna be a real daddy of a party.
We'll have champagne, caviar, a dance band, everything.
Where'd you say Jeannie was?
They're gonna be here any minute.
You know that?
What are you so nervous about?
Just relax.
This whole place is gonna be transformed in the blink of an eye.
Where'd you say Jeannie was?
She's in her bottle in my luggage aboard the ship.
She's where?
--all have a wonderful time and-- Well.
Ask her to move over.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hello.
Hello.
Hello?
What?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Thanks for calling.
l'll get down to the hospital right away.
Yeah.
Roger.
Roger!
Roger?
Roge!
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
-Yes, master?
-Good morning.
l'm in kind of a hurry.
Could you--?
Would you mind?
Thanks.
Where are you going?
You've not had your breakfast yet.
Well, l'm in kind of a hurry.
l just got a call from the hospital.
Roger's having an appendectomy.
What is an appendectomy?
The appendix is an organ right here and when you have it taken out, that's called an appendectomy.
-ls it serious?
-Well, no, not really.
Then you have time for a cup of coffee.
Maybe a quick one.
Thanks.
Do you know that thou has the most beautiful hands l've ever seen?
l beg your pardon?
They remind me of the hands of the great Rasha Houn.
Oh, really?
Who was he?
He was a famous surgeon in ancient Carthage.
You know, it's funny you should say that.
Know what l wanted to be ever since l was a kid more than anything?
-What?
-Well, you'll laugh.
A surgeon.
-Really?
-Yeah.
Roger.
Hi, Tony.
What are you doing here?
Scalpel, doctor.
Help.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Don't touch me.
Don't be ridiculous, Roger.
l'm not gonna hurt you.
Keep away from me!
Keep that away from me.
Help!
Get back on the table.
-What's going on here?
-l changed my mind, doctor.
l don't need an operation.
Just had a touch of indigestion.
Captain Healey!
Come back here!
l can't understand what got into him, doctor?
lt's a very clear case of preoperative shock.
Preoperative shock?
l never heard of that.
Well, it's very common in the bush country.
Excuse me, please.
Thank you.
The bush country?
Doctor.
Oh, doctor.
Just a moment.
l don't believe we've met.
l'm Dr. Bellows, senior psychiatrist here at the base.
Oh, yes, of course.
Pardon the glove.
l'm Dr. Rasha Houn.
-Oh, you're new here?
-Yes, yes, you might say that.
They just flew me in for the operation.
They flew you in to perform a simple appendectomy?
Yes, that's correct.
Well, doctor, there aren't any complications that l'm not aware of, are there?
Yes, there is one complication.
However, l expect to have it straightened out in a moment or two.
ls it something that you'd like to tell me about?
No, l don't think so.
Well, then.
lf there's anything that you should need, l'll be around.
l don't think l'll need your help.
Thank you.
l'll have Captain Healey brought back to the operating room for you.
-Don't bother.
-Don't bother?
No, he needs his rest.
Well, you're the doctor, doctor.
Yes, l am.
l'll reschedule his surgery for 2:00 this afternoon.
l'll see you then.
Strange l could have sworn we've met before.
Oh, nurse.
Could you tell me where Captain Healey's room is, please?
Oh, that's 304.
Right down the hall, doctor.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
-Hi, Roge.
How you feeling?
-How do l feel?
How would you feel if a friend started to operate on you with a scalpel that big?
What do you think l am?
l know what you are.
You're a quack.
Roge, l wasn't gonna operate on you.
What were you doing with that outfit on and that scalpel in your hand?
That was Jeannie's idea.
l casually mentioned that l'd always wanted to be a surgeon and she blinked and, well, there l was.
You mean, she turned you into a do-it-yourself Dr. Kildare like that?
Just like that: Well, what about me?
l've heard of Medicare, but this is ridiculous.
l'm gonna have a long talk with her, if l ever get my hands on her.
Yes, l think the patient needs massive doses of medication.
-Nurse, are you listening?
-Yes, master.
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
l always wanted to be a nurse.
l don't mind you being the nurse, but l'm not crazy about him as the doctor.
-Did the operation go well, master?
-Well, no.
As a matter of fact, there wasn't an operation.
Jeannie, do you realize the trouble you could've gotten me into?
-Oh, what trouble, master?
-What trouble?
Well, for one small thing it's against the law to operate on someone without a medical certificate.
'' Medical Board of Atlantis?
'' They were fine doctors.
Yeah?
l have a feeling you'd have a hard time convincing the American Medical Association.
l was only trying to please you.
Well, what are you trying to do to me?
-Roger-- -Keep away from me.
l do not understand why you are so worried.
lf you'll let Captain Nelson operate on you l'll give him the skill of a great surgeon.
l don't mind going in outer space with him but l don't want him fooling around with inner space.
-Especially when it's mine.
-He's right, Jeannie.
Just because you blinked me into a surgeon's outfit doesn't mean l'm a surgeon.
What if l'd said l wanted to be a violinist?
Do you know '' Melancholy Baby?
'' Now, look, Jeannie, this proves my point.
l have a violin in my hands, but l don't know how to play.
Listen.
-Hey!
-Hey, you're pretty good.
l've never done anything like that in my life.
l told you, master.
Now, will you let him operate on you?
Are you kidding?
l wouldn't let him play the violin for me.
As you wish.
l must go take care of my other patients.
Say, could you smuggle me out of here with the laundry?
-No, no.
l have a better idea.
-l don't like it.
Well, l haven't told you yet.
Now, here's the idea.
What l'm gonna do-- Oh, doctor.
Oh, yes.
Doctor Belos.
-Bellows.
-Yes.
Oh, doctor, you still have your mask on.
Do l?
Oh, yes, l do.
Well, l have a very bad cold.
l don't want to spread it around, you understand?
Oh, l see.
Well, Captain Healey l'm afraid this isn't gonna look very good on your service record.
Getting up off the table and racing out of the room just because you're afraid of a simple, little appendectomy.
What kind of an astronaut are you?
An astronaut who's afraid of a simple, little appendectomy.
l'm sure he will get over this.
Well, he better get over it by 2:00.
Dr. Rasha Houn has been kind enough to fly in here to perform this operation and he's going to perform it.
-Aren't you, doctor?
-Yes.
Well, of course, l don't want you to go to any trouble.
-lf Captain Healey is not ready, l-- -Oh, he's ready.
l'll go make the necessary arrangements.
Now you've done it.
Would you just take it easy.
l got a plan.
Tony, l love you, but l'm not going to let you operate on me.
Take it easy.
l haven't told you my plan yet.
-Now, here-- -Oh, doctor, l meant to ask you-- Where's Dr. Rasha Houn?
-Oh, he-- He left, sir.
-And l don't think he's coming back.
Oh, he'll be back.
l'm glad you're here, Captain Nelson.
Perhaps you could talk to Captain Healey.
He seems a little apprehensive about the operation.
Captain Healey?
Why, that's hard to believe, sir.
He's one of the bravest men in the world.
Ask anyone.
Captain Healey has appendicitis.
An appendectomy is gonna be performed on him at 2:00.
l would like another doctor.
Captain, the Air Force has gone to the trouble to fly in a great surgeon.
Now, could you ask for anything more?
Yes, sir.
Another doctor.
Captain Healey, the only one l'm authorizing to perform this operation on you is Dr. Rasha Houn.
-ls that clear?
-That's clear, sir, but l'd-- Then let's not hear any more about it.
What's this?
That's-- The doctor-- The doctor left that, sir.
l see.
Yes.
l think l see.
l wonder what he meant by that.
-Who cares?
-l ca--!
l care.
lf he gets suspicious and finds out that l'm Dr. Rasha Houn, l'm dead.
-And if you operate on me, l'm dead.
-Yeah.
-Hello.
-Hello.
You look lonely.
l'm not lonely, but my doll is.
Hey, you, nurse!
Now, look, l don't want no excuses.
Just tell them l want that money in by 6:00 tomorrow night or else.
You call this food?
lt's a bunch of garbage.
Oh, l'm so sorry.
l will see what l can do.
Hey, now.
lt's about time they send me a good-looking chick.
Yeah, you make all the other nurses look like men.
-What's your name, honey?
-No, Jeannie.
Yeah.
This is your lucky day.
Come here.
-Do you know who l am?
-No.
l'm afraid l do not.
l'm Big Charlie Lookey.
Oh, l am pleased to meet you.
And l'm pleased to meet you.
Please.
You must not do this.
Oh, baby, you and me are gonna get along great.
Just remember, don't ever tell Big Charlie what to do.
Please stop!
No, l ain't even got started yet.
l will see what l can do about your dinner.
Bye-bye.
-Are you sure you can swing it?
-There's nothing to it, Roge.
l'll simply tell Dr. Bellows that l got a very important telephone communication from a patient in London, and l have to fly there immediately.
He'll have no choice but to get another doctor.
Tony, you're a genius.
All right.
l'll go find Dr. Bellows.
You relax.
l'll be right back.
Thank you, doctor.
Come in.
-General Peterson.
-Yes, doctor?
-l'm sorry to disturb you, sir.
-That's all right.
lt's about Captain Nelson.
Again?
What's he done this time?
l think he's about to perform an appendectomy on Captain Healey.
-What?
-Yes, sir.
Why would he do a thing like that?
Oh, l don't know, sir.
l'm only a psychiatrist.
lf my suspicions are correct, for some unknown reason Captain Nelson is posing as a Dr. Rasha Houn.
He tried to operate this morning, and Captain Healey jumped off the operating table and fled from the room.
l can't say that l blame him.
Can you prove any of this?
l think l can, if you wouldn't mind coming to the hospital.
You couldn't keep me away.
And if you're wrong, doctor.
Oh don't worry, general.
l promise you this time we're gonna catch Captain Nelson red-handed.
l'll see you at the hospital, sir.
-Friend or foe?
-Foe.
-Find Dr. Bellows?
-No.
No, he's gone.
-Well, that makes two of us.
-Would you just relax, huh?
What's to relax about?
At 2:00, look who's gonna operate on me.
l am exhausted.
-Being a nurse is very hard work.
-Gee, should be a cinch for you.
All you have to do-- Hey, wait a minute.
What's the matter with me?
l don't have to have that operation.
Roger, you have appendicitis.
l know l have.
But Jeannie could cure that with a blink, right?
l would be happy to.
Well, that's a wonderful idea.
lt's great.
lt's impossible.
-Why?
-Why?
Why, you just heard her say she could do it.
That's not the point, Roger.
We can't afford a miracle cure.
Your appendicitis disappears by itself, doctors are gonna ask questions.
-How you gonna answer them?
-l'll think of something.
l'm sorry.
l'm sorry.
lt's a very simple operation.
You have to go through with it.
Well, if you're so eager, why don't you have it?
Because l don't have appendicitis.
Well, since you do not need me, l will go back to work.
All right, men.
Wait a minute, guys.
What's that?
We're taking you to the operating room.
Wait a minute.
l'm a sick man.
l don't wanna go to the operating room.
All right.
Just relax.
Just relax.
Everything's going to be fine.
Put your head down, please.
Thank you.
Doctor.
l'll take care of this, thank you.
Thank you, doctor.
-Tony, would you do me a favour?
-What, what?
Before you operate, could you read a medical pamphlet?
l'm not gonna let anything happen to you.
Of course not.
l'm leaving you my chess set, my little black book.
Stop talking like that.
You're making me nervous.
l'm making you nervous?
Boy, you need four hands to work in this place.
Would you like four hands?
No, thank you.
l'd have to buy too many gloves.
You're green, aren't you?
No.
Well, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
We all have to start someplace.
-ls this your first hospital?
-Oh, no.
l worked at the Babylon Memorial Hospital.
-ln New York?
-No.
ln Babylon.
Would you give me one of those test tubes over there, honey?
Which one would you like?
The one on the-- Oh, thank you very much.
You haven't been here long enough to know but let me tell you something.
The equipment in this hospital.
Did l bring the wrong test tube?
You stay right there.
You stay right here.
l'll be right back.
-l'll go with you.
-No, no.
Stay here.
Have l done something to offend thee?
No, but you've done something to offend me.
Now, please, don't be frightened, miss.
She's an amateur magician.
She's just nursing as a hobby.
So you don't have to worry about this.
l think she's going to give it up.
-What did l do wrong?
-l'll tell you what you did wrong.
You got out of your bottle this morning.
What are you trying to do, bring hospital down around our ears?
l'm being helpful.
There's a shortage of nurses.
Well, if you really want to be helpful, blink yourself out and go home.
-The patient in 31 2 needs a back rub.
-Let him do it himself.
The patient in 31 4 asked me to read to her?
No.
The patient in 31 6 says that if l would come down-- Out!
Hello.
Very nice seeing you this way.
-ls Jeannie all right?
-Yeah, Jeannie's fine.
The hospital's in trouble.
-Here's my plan.
-Yeah.
l'm gonna take you to the operating room.
l'll take you to the operating room, and then sneak out of here.
When Dr. Bellows can't find me, he'll have no choice but to get another doctor to operate on you.
Gee, l don't know how to thank you.
lt's wonderful for you not to operate on me.
Well, maybe someday you won't operate on me.
Anytime.
Doctor.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming, general.
Don't thank me yet, doctor.
You better be right.
l can't believe that Tony Nelson's involved with anything like this.
You don't have to believe it, sir.
l'm gonna prove it to you.
ln my book, Captain Nelson is one of the finest astronauts we have.
Don't misunderstand me, general.
l'm not questioning his capabilities.
All l'm saying is that he does some very peculiar things.
What kind of peculiar things?
Well, today is Saturday.
While most of the other astronauts are out playing golf Captain Nelson is here operating on Captain Healey.
Now, doesn't that strike you as being a little peculiar?
lt doesn't strike me as anything until you've proved it.
lt'll be a pleasure.
l'll go find Captain Nelson.
l think he's in Captain Healey's room.
Would you mind staying out of sight a few minutes, general?
l don't want to scare him off.
l cancelled a meeting in Washington for this.
You better know what you're talking about.
Would you mind getting out of here now?
Sure, sure.
l'll come and visit you when it's all over.
-Bring flowers.
-Yeah, okay.
Doctor?
-Going somewhere?
-Oh, yes, Dr?
-Bellows.
-Yes, Dr. Bellows.
l was just stepping out for a breath of fresh air.
l don't think you have time.
They're waiting for you in the operating room.
Something very important has come up.
l received a telephone communication from a patient in London-- -Shall we go, doctor?
-Well, you don't understand.
You see, this patient in London is very important to my career.
l-- For one thing.
To think, a minute ago l was panicky.
Now l feel like a million dollars.
Bring in the scalpels.
l'll be right back.
Hello, doctor.
l'm Captain Healey, the happy patient.
Oh, no.
Help.
General Peterson.
l'll admit it's taken me a long time, but it's been worth it.
Let's see you talk your way out of this one Captain Nelson.
Are you all through now, doctor?
Yes, sir.
l mean, no, sir.
Wait a minute.
There he is.
You can explain your behaviour at a general court-martial.
-Who are you?
-Who do you think l am?
l am Dr. Rasha Houn.
Wonderful, Roge, wonderful.
l told you there'd be nothing to it.
As a matter of fact, l'm gonna have my appendix out one of these days.
l'll drop in to see you later on today.
Right.
All right.
Bye.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Yes, master.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
l just talked to Roger.
He's feeling wonderful.
l am so pleased.
The operation was a complete success.
He'll be up and around in days.
l told you.
Rasha Houn is a wonderful surgeon.
Dr. Rasha Houn didn't perform the operation.
Why not?
His medical certificate expired about 2000 years ago.
They used a staff doctor.
But l've caused you all this worry for nothing.
Oh, no.
l wouldn't call it for nothing.
When l-- When l remember the expression on Roger's face when l came at him with a scalpel.
Oh, boy!
Oh, l am glad you are not angry, master.
Why should l be angry with you?
You were just trying to help me when l said l wanted to be a surgeon.
We all have these childhood dreams, Jeannie.
We get over them.
Did you have a childhood dream when you were a girl?
Oh, yes, master.
-What was it?
-Oh, it was nothing.
No, no.
Tell me.
Well, you will think it's silly.
No.
No, l wouldn't.
-l will go fix your breakfast.
-Jeannie.
l really want to know.
Well.
lf that is what you really wish.
No, Jeannie.
Really, what is it?
Lie back and relax, master.
Jeannie.
No.
Jeannie, no.
Don't operate.
No!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Fine, thank you.
That's enough.
Um, Jeannie Jeannie!
Some cakes, master?
No.
No.
No, thanks.
Jeannie, you've got to stop doing everything for me.
Oh, but that is what I am here for.
Well, I think you're too much of a good thing.
What does that mean?
Well, it means that I almost didn't pass my physical examination yesterday.
I haven't lifted a finger for myself since I found you on that bottle on the beach.
Well, why should you have to lift a finger when I can do everything for you?
Jeannie, promise me the next time I ask you to do anything for me, you'll refuse me.
Refuse you?
Oh, I cannot do that.
Oh, yes, you can.
I-I-I'm I lean on you too much.
You're getting to be a habit.
Oh, I want to be.
Now, promise me, the next time I ask you to do anything for me, you will just say, uh, um "Tough luck, Charlie".
"Tough luck, Charlie"?
Yeah.
That's right.
Promise.
Well, if that is what you wish.
What was that?
The sacred oath of the genies.
Oh, I see.
Well, I feel better already.
I better get to the base.
I've been assigned to a new secret project.
Oh, I love secrets.
What is it about?
Well, I'm afraid there's only four people in the world who know about this, and it's gonna have to remain that way for now.
Have a good day, huh?
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Yes?
I beg your pardon, sir, uh, we seem to be lost.
I'm looking for, uh, Oakdale Street.
Uh, Oakdale Oh, that's down to your left two blocks, and a left turn.
Well, my car's out in front.
Come and show us.
I'm sorry.
I really haven't got time.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist, Captain Nelson.
You're not gonna get away with this.
Get in the car, quickly.
Oh.
You fellows picked on the wrong man.
Jeannie!
Get rid of these guys.
Tough luck, Charlie?
Come along!
All right.
Right down there.
Sit here.
Listen.
You know, you fellows are gonna get in a lot of trouble.
I'm due at a very important meeting.
If they find I'm missing, huh, they're gonna start looking for me.
We know about the meeting, captain.
Do not worry.
You're gonna have it with us.
You're working on a project called, uh, Operation Gamma.
Well, that's interesting.
Tell me more.
You will tell us more, captain.
You will tell us everything we wish to know.
I'd certainly like to, but, um, I-I never heard of this, uh W-w-what did you say?
Do not be childish, Captain Nelson.
I have a drug that will make you very eager to talk.
Come.
Jeannie!
Jeannie?
Tony?
!
Hello!
Tony!
Hello!
Jeannie!
Oh, Jeannie Good morning, Captain Healey.
Good morning.
Look, I'm looking for Tony.
Tough luck, Charlie.
W-w-what did you say?
I said, tough luck, Charlie.
I heard you, but what does that mean?
It means that I cannot help Captain Nelson anymore, and if I tell you where he is, that would be helping him.
So I cannot tell you where he is.
W-w-w-wait a minute, let's Hold on.
Let's start from the be The beginning.
When did you see Captain Nelson last?
This morning, when he was leaving the house and the Chinese gentleman with a gun took him away in his car.
Oh, is that where he is?
Chinese gentleman with a gun took What Chinese gentleman with what gun?
The one who took him away in his car.
You mean, a man with a go And you didn't try to stop him?
Believe me, I wanted to, but he would not let me.
This morning, when I was pouring his coffee, he made me promise never to do anything for him again.
Well, Jeannie, pouring his coffee and being kidnapped are two different things.
He's in trouble.
You gotta help him.
I cannot!
I have taken the sacred oath, and if I break it, I will lose my power as a genie.
You mean there's nothing you can do to help him?
Oh, I did not want to take the sacred oath.
Well, couldn't you at least visit him and see how he is?
That is a wonderful idea.
Of course I could!
How soon could you leave?
Oh, Jeannie, I I knew you'd be along.
Hey, what kept you?
Will you get me out of here?
Tough luck, Charlie.
Tough luck, Charlie?
No.
Jeannie, you You don't understand.
That was just a joke.
A joke, you know it?
My name's not Charlie.
You know that.
Now, get me out of here.
Right now.
I wish I could, master.
I want to very much.
Well, all you have to do is blink these handcuffs off.
I cannot.
You made me take the sacred oath, and if I break it, I will lose my genie power.
Oh.
Jeannie they want some information out of me.
Now, if they force it out of me, it's It's gonna be bad.
Very bad.
Oh.
I cannot stand by and let them hurt you.
I will help you.
Oh, wonderful.
I-I knew you'd think of something.
I bet you got something great in store for them, huh?
Yes.
I can't wait to see their expressions.
Now, what are you gonna do to them?
Well, since I cannot help you as a genie, I'm going to help you as a woman.
You're gonna help me as a woman.
Yes!
And when they come in, I'm going to hit them with my fists.
You're going to hit them with your fists.
And I will tell them that I insist that they let you loose.
Jeannie, forget it.
Will you forget it!
They're coming.
They're coming.
I am ready for them.
No, no, no.
I want you to get out of here.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Go on, get out.
But what about you?
Well, I'll think of something.
But could you at least fix it so that when they give me this truth serum, I won't tell them what they want to know?
Whom were you speaking to, captain?
Oh, a little genie I picked up in a bottle on the beach one day.
I'm glad you still have your sense of humor.
Uh, Captain Nelson because I have such great respect for you, I'm gonna give you a chance to tell me what I wish to know without the indignity of Of this.
I tell you what, um Why don't we go down to my office?
And I can dig up some information for you there.
We're wasting time.
You, uh, won't change your mind?
I assure you that a few drops of this will make you tell us everything.
I I'd like to tell you, but I don't know anything about any new pro-projects.
Huh?
Hm.
This is a new serum, captain.
It begins operating in five seconds.
Now!
You will tell us everything you know about Operation Gamma.
Oh.
Operation Gamma is a project designed to  What is he saying?
Sounds like, uh Arabic.
He's telling us everything he knows, but we cannot understand a word.
Obviously been brainwashed.
Very clever, these Americans.
What will we do?
Um  You stay here with him.
Perhaps you can make him talk.
It will be a pleasure.
Oh, poor master.
Oh.
Jeannie, did I tell them anything?
Oh, nothing that will do them any good.
Oh.
Thanks, Jeannie.
Oh Poor, poor master.
I don't suppose you can get poor master out of here?
Only one genie ever broke the sacred oath.
What happened?
She turned to dust.
Huh?
Well Jeannie, can you at least tell Roger where I am?
I am afraid not.
But I do not think there is any harm in telling him what is happening to you.
You do that, yeah.
And Roger will find a way to rescue me.
Good old Roger.
Uh, Captain Nelson.
You have a treat in store for you.
One of the, uh, oldest form of torture known to man.
Did you see him?
Yes.
Captain Nelson's being held prisoner by Chinese secret agents in Cocoa Beach.
Chinese secret agents in Cocoa Beach?
Mm-hm.
They gave him some truth serum, but it's all right, because he answered them in Arabic.
Oh, that's using his head.
I'd better report this back to headquarters.
I'll be right back.
Oh, Captain Healey.
Yes?
Did you find Captain Nelson?
Oh, did I?
Chinese secret agents are holding him prisoner in Cocoa Beach.
Chinese secret agents are holding him prisoner in Cocoa Beach?
Yes, sir.
Did you see this?
Well, not exactly, sir.
But I found it out from an informed source.
See, secret agents gave Tony a shot of truth serum, but he fixed them.
He answered their questions in Arabic.
Captain Nelson doesn't speak Arabic.
I know, sir.
That's what was so clever.
We We better track Tony down and find him, sir.
There's no time to lose.
Yes, of course.
The important thing is to stay calm.
Stay calm?
Sir, there's no telling what they're doing to him.
Why don't you go and see if you can find some more information.
Good idea, sir Meanwhile, you start the ball rolling.
Uh, General Peterson I'm calling about Captain Nelson and Captain Healey.
General this time I've got them.
What is happening to you, master?
I am taking a shower.
Those handcuffs are most difficult to get out of, are they not?
Yes.
Yes, you might say that.
Jeannie would you hand me the, uh, screwdriver on the desk over there, please?
Tough luck, Charlie.
Did you tell Roger what's happening to me?
Oh, yes, master.
And he was most upset.
Good, good.
He'll get people stirred up.
I'll bet at this very moment, there are hundreds of men combing the streets of Cocoa Beach for me.
They're coming.
Now, get out of here, Jeannie.
I don't want you to get hurt.
Oh, let me stay with you.
No.
I'll handle them alone.
Oh!
Oh.
Well Thank you, miss.
Look, ahem, I'm in a little trouble, and I need your help.
My name is Captain Anthony Nelson, United States Air Force?
And, uh, I've been kidnapped, and as you can probably observe, I'm being held prisoner.
I need you to get to a phone just as quickly as possible, and call, uh, General Peterson at Cape Kennedy.
Uh, you got that?
That's General Peterson at Cape Your car is hidden away, Princess.
Forget the phone call.
I'm sorry that, uh, we have inconvenienced you, Captain Nelson, but, uh, we need some information from you.
Tough luck, Charlie.
Let me take care of him!
No!
I have plans for him.
Well, I certainly wouldn't want to upset your plans, but you must realize, I have plans of my own.
Why should we settle with one piece of information, when there is much that Captain Nelson can tell us?
But he will not talk.
He will talk.
We are gonna take him with us.
There we are going to have plenty of time.
Any news?
Yes.
Their leader is a beautiful princess, and she is going to take my master away.
Take him away where?
I do not know.
But I am sure it is out of the country.
Don't worry, Jeannie.
They'll never get him out of the country.
Dr. Bellows probably has half the Air Force looking for him.
I'll tell you what.
I'll go back and tell him the latest news.
You keep an eye on Tony, okay?
Hm!
I certainly will.
Yeah.
Okay.
Guess who the ringleader is.
A beautiful female spy.
A princess.
A princess?
They're taking him out of the country.
At least she thinks she is.
But you're gonna stop her, aren't you, sir?
I promise you that Captain Nelson won't be taken out of the country by a beautiful female spy.
I knew I could count on you, sir.
I'd better get back to see how Tony is.
Uh, yes, do that.
And keep me informed of any developments.
Yes, sir.
You'll be the first to know.
A beautiful female spy?
Are you out of your mind?
I'm not.
No, sir.
And I must say that this doesn't surprise me one bit.
As a matter of fact, general, I'm writing a book on Captain Nelson's behavior.
And I'm also gonna do a sequel on Captain Healey.
Well, doctor, I don't pretend to know anything about psychiatry.
But I do know something about men.
I'd stake my life on either one of them.
I don't believe that Captain Nelson is being held by any Chinese spies.
Neither do I. But the point is that Captain Nelson and Captain Healey believe it.
Captain Healey tell you that?
Yes, sir.
He was in my office not five minutes ago.
Where is he now?
He went back to get further information.
Let me know when you hear from him.
Believe me, I will, general.
So you still refuse to talk, Captain Nelson.
You could save yourself a lot of trouble by letting me go.
I'm not afraid of trouble, captain.
Are you?
No.
See, I'm gonna take you to a secluded place high in the mountains where we can, uh, work.
I can hardly wait, princess.
There's a boat waiting for us at the pier.
And, uh, we have already contacted the submarine.
Submarine?
You are a very important man, Captain Nelson.
Well, thanks.
How soon can we, uh, leave?
The car will be ready in 30 minutes.
Good.
But, meanwhile, let's don't be rude to our guest.
Uh, take him down, and we'll have some tea.
I will prepare it.
Oh.
What's happening?
The beautiful lady spy is going to give my master some drugged tea.
Drugged tea?
He will not have a chance.
They are going to place him on board a submarine and take him away.
Oh, drugged tea submarine take him away.
I got it.
You better get back to him.
Oh, what's the use?
I cannot do anything to help him.
Oh, you may not be helping him, but you're sure making me feel a lot better.
Dr. Bellows.
Oh.
Any news?
Oh, I'll say.
This lady spy is going to slip Tony some drugged tea and take him away in a submarine.
Drugged tea Yes, sir.
And a submarine?
Yes, sir.
All we have to do now is alert the Navy.
Oh, yes.
Uh, how do you feel, captain?
How do I?
I feel fine, sir.
Hm, no headaches, dizziness?
No, it's Tony's drugged tea, not mine.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I'll see if I can get the name of the submarine and get back to you, okay, sir?
Okay.
I don't believe it.
You can ask Captain Healey.
I intend to.
Where is he?
He went back to get the name of the submarine.
When he returns, I'd like to see him here in my office.
And, uh I want you here too, doctor.
Mm.
I think you're making a mistake.
I can force the information we want from him and then dispose of him.
I am in charge.
That's right.
She's in charge.
And don't you forget it.
It's too risky to try to get him out of here.
It is a risk we must take.
I agree with her.
Be quiet!
Don't be a poor loser.
My orders are to get all the information I can from him at any cost.
Nothing was said about taking him out of the country.
I have changed those orders.
Yeah Oh, and very wisely.
Very wisely.
See, he is worth much more to us alive than dead.
Oh, I should hope so.
Not good thinking, Wong.
Go help Chan with the tea.
Uh, Wong.
Uh, go light on the sugar.
I'm on a diet.
Princess I don't trust him.
Why should you?
He's your enemy.
No.
I mean, I don't trust him for you.
I think he's out to get your job.
I have a feeling he's pretty tricky.
There's only one way to keep him from getting you.
And what is that?
Get him first.
Now, here's my plan.
You help me take off these handcuffs, and you and I will slip away, and  Do not be impatient.
We're gonna spend many long hours together in my country.
Here we are.
Now, this will refresh you.
Oh, smells wonderful.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
It's clumsy of me.
Iwasn't very thirsty Bring another cup.
No, you don't have to bother for me.
You will do as you're told, Captain Nelson.
Oh, Captain Healey, it is terrible.
Don't worry about a thing.
We got the Air Force out, the Navy.
Everything's under control.
It is too late.
They are forcing him to drink the drugged tea.
Then stop them.
I cannot break my oath.
As long as I am his genie, I c I Oh.
Take this.
Take Take this?
What for?
Then you will be my new master.
I'll be your new master?
Mm.
Oh, Jeannie, this is the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me.
Now, now Now, say that you command the bottle.
I command the bottle.
Oh.
Now that Captain Nelson is no longer my master, I am free of my oath to him.
Huh.
Jeannie, you remember that Rolls-Royce you, uh, got for me once?
Well, I'd like it back, only this time with a gold top.
And, uh, I'd like my yacht back again only this time with a lar Lar J-Jeannie?
Jeannie.
You will drink this.
Drink it, captain.
I don't like tea!
What are you doing?
Oh.
I do not know.
Jeannie, you'll turn to dust!
Oh, there you are.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
Oh, Tony!
Wha What about your oath?
Oh, I'm free of my oath be Because I am no longer your genie.
What do you mean you're no longer my genie?
What she's trying to say is, buddy, that she has a new master, and you're looking at him.
Now you will give the bottle back to Captain Nelson.
Oh-ho.
Why would I want to do a stupid thing like that?
What is more important to you?
A new car, or saving your friend's life?
What kind of new car?
Oh, I I was only kidding.
She's yours.
I I guess she could never really belong to anybody else.
Thanks, Roge.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, we'd better get back to the base.
They must be going crazy.
Oh, wait!
Wait!
What are we gonna tell them?
Uh I don't know.
I'll think of something.
Jeannie.
And, please?
Thank you.
I've seen things like this before, general, but never in such an advanced stage.
My suggestion is, uh, that they be given a complete rest of at least three months.
Captain Healey.
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Uh, no, sir.
It's It's, uh it's my fault.
I I was working home, and I got so carried away I lost all track of time.
I really must apologize.
You've been at home all this time?
Well Tell him about the Chinese secret agents who were holding him prisoner.
Uh Chinese secret agents holding me prisoner?
You weren't being held prisoner?
What about the beautiful princess?
The ringleader of the spies?
Did you tell him about that?
DR.
He certainly did.
And he told me about the submarine and drugged tea.
You shouldn't have done that.
That was supposed to be a secret.
You see?
What is this all about?
Well, sir, it's a It's the plot of a show that Roger and I are writing for the Air Force Benefit Funds.
Yeah.
The plot of a?
Yeah, well, don't blame Dr. Bellows, sir.
Thank you, captain.
Dr. Bellows you know that three months' rest that we were talking about?
Yes, sir.
I don't think that's long enough.
Make it six months.
Well, that's a splendid idea, general.
And you can begin immediately, doctor.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Congratulations, Tony.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, what for?
Congratulations, captain.
Yeah.
What did I do?
Well there you are, captain.
Congratulations.
Thank you, sir.
What's everybody congratulating me for?
You haven't heard the news?
No, sir.
I just got in from a mission to Canada.
I I don't know anything.
Then let me be the first to tell you.
You and Captain Healey are on the promotion list.
Major.
Well how about that.
You'll be losing your rail road tracks.
Ha!
Well, that's wonderful.
I I I bet you Roger's happy, huh?
How soon will you be ready to take off again?
Oh, right away, sir.
Why?
General Peterson wants you and Major Healey to fly to Nellie Air Force Base, and then on to Stead Air Force Base.
He wants you to do a few lectures on, uh, winged spacecraft, and, uh, at the advanced fighter weapon school there.
Oh, good.
Good.
I'd love that.
Give me a chance to see some old buddies from Korea.
I'll tell the general.
Roger that.
Oh, um major?
Uh major.
Oh, uh I'm sorry, sir.
I have no desire to, uh, break up certain, uh, peculiar occurrences, but there are things that a captain might do that a major definitely would not do.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, sir.
Good.
Just so long as we understand each other.
Oh, thank you very much, doctor.
My pleasure.
Major.
Good morning, master.
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
I brought you this telegram.
I thought it might be important.
Oh.
How about that.
It's from one of the boys in Washington congratulating me.
I've been promoted to major.
Oh, how wonderful.
Oh, what does it mean?
Maj Oh, that means I've been promoted to the next highest rank.
Oh, yeah.
One of these days I'm gonna be a lieutenant colonel, and then, uh Well, then I hope to be a colonel.
What will happen when you are a colonel?
Well, then I get to wear birds on my shoulders.
And this is what you wish?
Uh, you bet.
Are you sure you would not like to take me with you?
Well, Jeannie, if they ever found out about you, they'd bust me to civilian.
Oh, that'll be Roger.
Good morning, major.
Good morning, major.
I like the sound of that.
So do I. Hey, you all ready for Nellie and Stead?
Yup.
And who is Nellie?
Oh.
Nellie's the nickname for Nellie Air Force Base.
Hi, Jeannie.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Boy, the three of us are gonna have a ball.
The three of us?
No, the two of us.
Jeannie's not going.
What did you what did you say?
I said Jeannie's not going.
You're kidding.
General Peterson said when we finished our lecture we could have a few days leave, right?
Yeah.
Since Stead is only a Only a couple of miles from Reno, you said we could hop over there.
Yeah, that's right.
And you're seriously thinking of going to Reno without Jeannie?
Oh, no, no.
I-I'm not thinking about it.
I've already made up my mind.
Jeannie can't go.
W I will not be in the way.
See?
She will not be in the way.
You can't leave her here.
Listen, 10 minutes with her in the casino, and you'll come back a multimillionaire.
I don't want to be a multimillionaire.
Well, how about a plain millionaire?
Roger, if I wanted to be a millionaire, I wouldn't have joined the Air Force.
Become a millionaire for me.
I always wanted to have a millionaire friend.
You're just wasting your time.
You and I are going to Reno.
Jeannie is staying here.
Will you tell me something?
How did you ever pass the Air Force intelligence test?
Jeannie, in.
I have never seen Reno.
In.
Are you sure you would not like to be a millionaire?
Have a nice journey.
Thank you.
I better go get my flight bag.
Take it easy.
Well, if you don't want to become a millionaire, I can't force you to.
It's your genie.
On the other hand, I'm your buddy.
And if you should become a millionaire how mad at me could you get?
Jeannie.
Jeannie, can I talk to you?
Yes, Major Healey.
Sh!
Would you?
Would you really?
Would you really like to go with us?
Oh, I would like to!
Ah Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.
Ooh.
Welcome to Reno.
Ahem.
Ahem.
Roge.
Uh look, believe me, I'm doing the right thing.
Jeannie, I'll be back in a few days.
I'll let you out then.
Oh, don't look so glum.
You'll feel better once we get there.
I feel better already.
Uh, easy with that.
I've got a few important things in there.
Nice place, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Nice.
I've got the feeling these will be two of the luckiest days of our lives.
Oh, yeah?
What makes you think so?
Oh, just one of my crazy hunches.
Uh, look, why don't you go down to the casino?
Uh, I'll be right there.
Hm?
No.
I'm in no rush.
I'll wait for you.
Ah.

You sure you know what you're doing?
You bet.
Okay, if you're sure.

I met a couple of nice, young ladies downstairs, very attractive and willing to have dinner.
Girls?
Is that all you can think about, is girls?
Well, look who's talking.

I knew I could count on you.
We've been buddies a long time.
We've been through a lot together.
Yeah.
Most of it today.
Look, I don't ask too many favors of you, but, uh, I'm gonna ask you for one right now.
What is it?
Don't go swimming.
Uh, w-what kind of a favor is that?
Well, if I go down to that casino by myself, I I'm liable to get in trouble.
I never told you this before, but, uh I'm a compulsive gambler.
Roge, I never knew that about you.
I had my own floating crap game when I was 6 years old.
Tony would?
Would you go down and bet this for me?
You sure you know what you're saying?
You want me to bet this?
This $100 worth?
That's right.
And if I should lose it?
I'll laugh.
Roge, do me a favor.
When we get back to Cape Kennedy I want you to have a long talk with Dr. Bellows.
Anything you say.
Look, you get dressed.
I'll meet you down at the casino, huh?
Thank you, sir.
Oh, see what he gave me.
Never mind that.
Look, now remember what I told you, okay?
Mm-hm.
Oh.
Here he comes.
You better keep out of sight.
If he finds you here, he'll kill both of us.
Oh.
Oh, there you are.
Oh, I knew I could count on you.
I almost changed my mind.
I still think this is a mistake, Roger.
Now look, don't worry about a thing.
Here's $50.
Bet it on anything you like.
Are you sure you're feeling all right?
This is your $50.
I can bet it on anything I like?
That's what I said, buddy.
And if I lose, you'll, uh I'll laugh.
Ha-ha-ha!
All right.
Just sit right here, lucky.
Fifty dollars, please.

You're breaking me.
Are you working for your master or for the house?
Did it not go well?
That's right, it did not go well.
Oh, I am sorry.
But I do not understand this strange game that my master is playing.
Well, you don't understand Oh.
How stupid can I get!
Perhaps my master is right.
I-I think I will go home now.
Oh, you can't go home now.
We're in the verge of being rich.
You stay right here.

Remember, seven, 11.
Got it?
I got it.

Oh.
Oh.
Do, uh, many people try that?
Only once, major.
Oh, I see.
I see.
What will happen to him?
Oh, let us just say that the guards will take care of him.
Yeah.
Let's just say that.
Are you having any luck at the tables?
No.
No, no, no.
No, no.
I'm just placing a few bets for a friend of mine.
I'm not much of a gambler.
Well, enjoy yourself.
I've got to go take care of someone.
Oh.
I thought I lost you.
Don't scare me like that.
Yeah, where are we going?
To the crap table.

You know how it is.
Easy come, easy go.

And if you're interested in miracles, it's a miracle we weren't arrested.
Now, Jeannie, I ask you not to go to Reno.
Oh.
I've never been so embarrassed in my life.
I was only trying to help Help me.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
That's when I get into most of my trouble, when you're trying to be helpful.
What was your excuse, major?
I'm greedy.
Well, I I hope you both learned a lesson from this.
Well, I certainly learned my lesson, Tony.
Oh, so have I, master.
I will not try to help with the dice again.
I am much better with horseraces.
Horseraces?
Really?
Oh, yes.
I can make any horse win.
Well, the track opened yesterday.
The three of us could have a ball That's a wonderful idea.
You really like horseraces?

Well, how about that?

l don't mind being out of uniform-- Would you mind getting me dressed, please?
My briefcase, please.
-What is this place?
-This is a-- A golf course.
-Country club.
They play golf here.
-Do you play this golf?
No, l don't.
Jeannie, l have a very important report to get to the general.
Why don't you look around here, or something.
All right, master.
Maybe later on, if he doesn't need me, l could take you for a drive down to the beach, huh?
-Thank you, master.
-Okay.
You just take a look around.
All right.
General.
Dr. Bellows.
Tony, you must live right next to the golf course.
The route l took, sir, there wasn't much traffic.
Strange.
When l drove out here, it was bumper-to-bumper.
l have the reports, sir.
The correlation tables worked out more or less the way we expected.
You'll be pleased.
Good.
l want to go over them before the meeting Monday morning.
-Thanks for bringing it over.
-Thank you, sir.
-Doctor.
-Goodbye, Major Nelson.
Doctor, we have a problem.
l know, sir.
l'm keeping an eye on him.
l'm talking about the fact that Admiral Tugwell and his aide are flying down here next week.
They're coming down to inspect the base?
Don't be naive.
They've seen the base.
The admiral is coming down for some golf.
We do this once a year.
And he's beaten me seven years in a row.
This year l intend to beat him.
l wish you luck, general.
Now, the admiral and his aide shoot in the low 7 0s.
So do l. But l can beat them if l can find the right man to play with.
Well, now, how about Henderson or Lukerthon?
Well, they're good, but they're not good enough.
l need someone who's almost a pro, and that's where you come in.
l don't play golf, general.
But you have the files of every man on the base.
l want you to find me the best golfer we have.
l'm not going to let the Navy beat the Air Force again.
l understand, sir.
-l'll just make a phone call.
-You do that.
Excuse me, general.
That looks like fun.
Well, hello, major.
lt is fun.
l'm Jerry Barber.
l'm the professional here.
-How do you do?
Very nice to.
-Would you like to try one?
l don't play golf.
Sorry.
Oh, come on.
Go ahead.
-Really?
-Please do.
Where did l go wrong?
Major, put your feet a little farther apart.
Put your hands on the club a little over here.
Bend over a little.
Try it again.
Well, l'm afraid l'm not much of a golfer.
Try it again, major.
Feet a little farther apart.
Bend over a little at the waist.
-Hands a little firmer on the club.
-Right, right.
lt's a lot harder than it looks.
l'd like to be able to knock this ball about 400 yards down the fairway.
Well, major, l'm afraid there's very few people that have ever done that.
And you're one of them.
That was a 400-yard drive.
l got his name, general.
lt's Edward Sheldon.
-He shoots in the low 7 0s.
-Forget it.
l got a man who shoots in the 60s.
-ln the 60s?
Who's that, sir?
-Major Nelson.
Tony Nelson?
General, l happen to know he doesn't even play golf.
You really got it in for him, haven't you?
Not at all, sir.
lt's not my fault he doesn't play golf.
l saw him at a driving range one day with Major Healey.
He was terrible.
He's good enough to beat Admiral Tugwell.
l've been waiting for this chance for seven years.
General, if you want to win that match l assure you, you're making a terrible mistake.
l'm not only gonna win it, l'm doubling the stakes.
A 400-yard drive.
Could you do that again, major?
Oh, no.
Never in a million years.
lt's just a lucky fluke.
How about trying it?
Well, all right.
lf you really want me to.
You did it again.
That's the most remarkable drive l've ever seen in my life.
That's easily 400 yards.
Well, l guess l'm better than l thought.
Major, l guess maybe you are too.
Will you excuse me, major?
l've got a lesson.
l'll have to be off.
Good luck to you.
Thank you.
And thank you for the instruction.
-Thank you.
-How about that.
Well.
Hi, Jeannie.
Jeannie, what--?
Did?
Oh, l see.
lt's Dr. Bellows.
-Major Nelson.
-Dr. Bellows.
Have you taken up golf?
No, l'm afraid l'll never become a golfer, sir.
Well, that's what l thought.
And yet l wouldn't want to be wrong again.
-Wrong about what?
-Oh, nothing.
Oh, would you mind hitting a ball for me?
-And what for, sir?
-l'd just like to see you hit the ball.
-Test my reflexes, sort of?
-Something like that.
All right.
You see, the important thing is to grip the club firmly bend over slightly and keep your feet wide apart.
l'm afraid that wasn't very good.
l'll give it another try.
No, no, no.
l've seen enough.
General Peterson would like you to stop by his office this afternoon.
-l wonder why.
-So do l. So do l. Be your golf partner in a tournament?
Well, l'm afraid that's impossible, sir.
lmpossible?
-Why is it impossible?
-Well, for one thing-- You're not turning professional, are you?
Professional, sir?
l couldn't even make amateur.
-The admiral got to you.
-No, sir.
l don't know who's been telling you l'm a great golfer, but they're kidding you.
My average drive is three feet.
That is, if the wind's with me.
Tony, l don't want to pry into your life.
lf you've given up golf, l'm sure you had a good reason for it.
-Given it up, sir?
-Well, maybe it's taken up too much of your time, or you gave someone a promise -not to play anymore.
-No.
Sir, l assure you-- l don't care what your reasons are.
You're my partner in that golf match Saturday.
l want to win that more than l want to win anything in my life.
And you're asking me to be your golf partner?
l'm not asking you, l'm telling you.
Someone's in for a big surprise Saturday.
Whatever made you do a thing like that?
-You did.
-Me?
Well, you said you wanted to hit the ball 400 yards.
Why do you listen to me?
-Because l want to make you happy.
-You want to make me happy?
At my own court-martial, you want to make me happy?
Jeannie, if l don't play that game on Saturday General Peterson's gonna think l'm the poorest sport of the year.
And if l do play, he's gonna kill me.
Do not worry, master.
l will see that you play well.
Now, Jeannie, that's just the point.
l can't let you do something like that.
l don't know how it was in Baghdad in the old days but we have something here called sportsmanship.
You simply don't cheat at games.
You finally got me in a spot l can't get out of.
l'm sorry, master.
Hello.
Anybody home?
-Hi, Roge.
-Hi, Tony.
Hi, Jeannie.
Hey, listen, do you two wanna laugh?
You won't believe this.
There's a rumour going around the base that General Peterson picked you for his partner for the big golf match Saturday.
-ls that wild?
-Oh, yeah.
-lt's also true.
-You're not serious, are you?
No, l'm not serious, but General Peterson is.
-But you don't play golf.
-l know l don't.
That's what l tried to tell General Peterson, but he wouldn't listen.
lt is my fault.
l: And he: -Well, l guess l'll be running along.
-Wait a minute.
l'm in trouble, Roger.
l know.
That's why l'm running along.
l don't want to tangle with General Peterson.
He thinks of golf the way most people think of mother.
Roger, somebody needs to help me think of a way out of this.
Well, you could have Jeannie break General Peterson's arm.
-That's it.
-You want me to break -General Peterson's arm?
-No, no, my arm.
You want me to break your arm?
No, Jeannie.
l don't want you to break anybody's arm.
But what's to stop me from putting a sling on my arm and telling General Peterson that l hurt it?
That's brilliant.
You can't play golf with your arm in a sling.
Thanks, Jeannie.
Well, l better go tell General Peterson that he's just gonna have to -pick another partner for Saturday.
-Well, good luck.
Yeah.
Are you telling me that Major Nelson has broken his arm?
No, sir.
His arm is perfectly fine.
-But he has it in a sling.
-That's right.
l was wondering how Major Nelson was gonna get out of playing in that golf match.
Now we know.
Major Nelson is in Dr. Bellows' office.
-l want him.
-Yes, sir.
-Oh, major?
-Yes?
General Peterson would like to see you in his office.
-Thank you very much.
-Yes, sir.
There you are.
Listen, have you seen Peterson yet?
-No.
-l just got the flash.
They're ready to pick the astronauts for the Apollo test flight.
What?
Yeah, and l think they'd like someone with two arms.
You'll be able to spot all the classic symptoms of the faker immediately, general.
When he comes in that door, notice his expression.
lt'll be listless.
And the way he moves as though he's racked with pain.
General Peterson, you want to see me, sir?
You should have seen the expression on Dr. Bellows' face.
How did you explain the sling, master?
Well, luckily, l didn't tell Dr. Bellows l had had an accident.
He told me l'd had an accident.
l am pleased that everything turned out so well, master.
Oh, yeah, everything's just great except for one tiny detail.
-What is that?
-l'm in the same trouble l was when l walked out of this house this morning.
General Peterson still expects me to play in that game on Saturday.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Jeannie.
Well, Merry Christmas from your friendly golf instructor, Roger.
-What's all this?
-This is a solution to your problems.
l'm going to teach you how to play golf.
You see, master, your problem is solved.
You really think you can do it, Roge?
Well, at least when you get out there Saturday you won't make a complete fool out of yourself.
Well, Roger, l certainly appreciate this.
Well, let's see how you can putt, huh?
Look, just follow my instructions -and you won't have any problems.
-All right.
Just hold a club like this, nice and relaxed.
-All right.
-Okay.
-Now, bend over.
-Bend over.
-Head over the ball.
-Head over the ball.
-Feet apart.
-Feet apart.
-Knees together.
-Knees together.
-Now, just relax the wrist.
-Relax the wrist.
Right there.
Now, just a short backswing.
Short backswing.
-Follow through, and hit the ball.
-Right.
Would you like me to move the cup to the ball?
-No.
Thank you, Jeannie.
-Well, you only missed it by a room.
Naturally, it'll take me a little time to get the hang of it.
-Yeah, naturally.
Naturally.
-How long do you think it'll take -before l'm ready for the match?
-lf you practice hard every day?
-Yeah, if l practice hard every day.
-About 1 985.
Golf clubs, golf shoes.
Got my golf tees.
-Golf balls.
Golf balls!
-Here they are, master.
Thank you, Jeannie.
-What are you all dressed up for?
-l'm going to the tournament with you.
Fine.
Fine.
-You do not mind?
-No, of course not.
Why should l mind?
You could always-- You could always caddy for me.
l would be happy to, whatever that is.
Well, it's very simple.
You take a tee like this, you see, and you-- l'm sorry, would you mind getting that for me, please?
Certainly, master.
l'm sorry about this but you'll have to stay in there until the game's over.
But you need me, master.
Yeah.
Yeah, l know l do but the force of genies aren't allowed.
l think your partner's got cold feet and isn't gonna show up.
He'll be along.
He doesn't know what sharks you two are.
Well, we'll try and give him a good game, general.
-Sorry l'm late, sir.
-This is Major Nelson.
Admiral Tugwell.
-Nice knowing you, major.
-Pleasure.
-Commander Davis.
-How do you do?
What do you--?
What's your game?
-What do you shoot?
-Well, quail mostly.
He's too smart to give anything away.
You'll see when you put your money up.
Pete, would you like to double last year's stakes?
Well, l don't know.
You know, Major Nelson's not much of a player.
He's.
Well, he's kind of a last-minute replacement but, still l'll double the stakes.
-Done.
-Done?
Sir, could l speak to you a moment?
Privately.
Major, no secret strategy meetings, please.
-l'll talk to you later.
-Yeah, l'm sure you will.
Well, come on, let's get some practice.
-Hey, nice drive.
-Good one, commander.
Very good, sir.
You think you can follow that, general?
Yeah.
Good luck, sir.
Oh, thank you, major.
Very good, sir.
Very good.
You didn't come out here for nothing, did you?
Well, anchors aweigh.
-Nice shot, Roy.
-Yeah, very nice.
-Oh, me.
-All right, major.
-Tricky little devils, aren't they?
-Yes.
You're not going to use an iron, are you, major?
-What, sir?
-Here, use my driver.
Thank you.
-l can't even see it.
-The ball is still on the tee.
Sir, l'd like to explain.
You don't have to explain.
That was brilliant.
-Brilliant?
-Why didn't l think of that?
You just keep on pretending that you're a dub.
Then at the last minute, you'll come through and we'll wallop them.
Yes.
Don't overdo it.
These guys are pretty smart.
They know that no one could be that bad.
We'll concede that, major.
We do want to finish the 1 8 holes before dark.
That's all right, major.
You're only 1 6 strokes behind.
Don't you think you ought to start now, Tony?
l have started, sir.
What you're seeing is my game.
All right.
But don't keep it up too long.
Roger, what are you doing here?
Well, l thought l'd stop by and see how my pupil's doing.
My score is 29.
-You're kidding.
-On the third hole.
Holy-- Are you keeping your eye on the ball?
l'm keeping my eye on a jet that'll take me to Brazil.
Roger, l'm getting slaughtered.
l don't mind so much for myself.
But if we lose, it's gonna kill General Peterson.
Yeah, and if it kills General Peterson, it's going to kill you.
-Why isn't Jeannie helping?
-Well, you know how she is.
Yeah, she's great.
She's here, isn't she?
Roge, l don't want to hold up the game.
Wait a minute.
Why don't you have her help you?
Because l don't think General Peterson would want to win that way.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Thank you, Major Healey.
Jeannie, your master's in trouble.
You gotta-- Boy, that's one golf match l would have loved to have seen.
Would you like to pick it up and take the penalty?
No, no, no.
lt's fine.
General, nothing short of a miracle is gonna make you win this match.
You never know when a miracle is gonna happen, do you?
Any time, major.
Yes.
Sorry, sir.
l didn't even see you hit the ball, major but it was a beautiful drive.
l'm afraid that's your ball, major.
Tough luck.
Snead used a slice on a lie like this.
Slice.
Yes, a slice.
You're going to use a putter?
Yes, l always use a putter on a lie like this.
Pardon me, gentlemen.
Fantastic.
Yes.
Yes, you might say that, sir.
Wow!
What do you think of that?
Another 40-footer.
l've been playing golf for nearly 30 years and l've never seen anything like it.
You know what your score is like, major?
No, sir.
Well, you've got four eagles, four double eagles seven holes in one.
Your total score is 54.
That's good, huh?
Well, Sam Snead won a tournament with a 59.
You were five under him.
Major, it certainly has been a privilege -to play golf with you.
-Yes, sir.
l'll mail you a check, Pete.
No, no, sir.
l couldn't allow you to do that.
Why, he's right.
The kind of golf we were privileged to be a part of today shouldn't be tainted with commercialism.
Well, thank you, general.
You broke every record in the book.
Yes, sir, l know, and a few that weren't in the book.
Shall we go?
They said it was the greatest golf game they've ever seen.
Fifty-four.
l should say so.
l knew l was a good golf teacher -but that's ridiculous.
-lf you like, l can cut that score in half.
No, thanks, Jeannie.
Frankly, l don't care if l ever see another golf club again.
Thanks.
-Hi.
Dr. Bellows.
-Skedaddle.
Major Healey.
Major Nelson.
l just dropped by to congratulate you on your victory.
Thank you, sir.
l'm sorry l wasn't able to watch the game.
Yeah, so was l. -But however, l'll watch the next one.
-Next one?
l don't think that Tony's going to be playing golf anymore, sir.
Oh, yes, he is.
General Peterson has just entered you in the National Open.
And l'll be there to watch your every move.
Well, gentlemen, if you'll just excuse me.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Jeannie.
Jeannie, uh, would you come out, please?
I'd like my breakfast.
Yes, master, one egg and two slices of bacon.
That's right.
What's the matter?
Oh nothing.
Oh, now, now, come on.
Something's on your mind.
W-what is it?
Well If you must know, I am being wasted.
Huh?
Anyone can make you one egg and two slices of bacon.
Oh, if you would only permit me, I could do such big things for you.
I could give you castles and gold and One egg, two slices of bacon, not too crisp, please.
I gave my last master a fleet of ships.
And a cup of coffee.
Why do you not let me help you?
Jeannie, I I really don't need a fleet of ships.
But if I do, believe me, you'll be the first to know.
Perhaps a villa on the Nile?
Really, I'm very happy with the house.
It's It's very comfortable.
Just breakfast, please.
Major Healey loved the yacht I gave him.
Yeah.
Look at the trouble he got into.
There is a wonderful diamond mine in Africa I could get you.
Jeannie, I I don't need a diamond mine.
I get a salary from the air force, very adequate.
And, uh And I must say, I earn my salary.
See, that's the point.
I like to do things for myself.
I will be a laughing stock.
A genie who can only bring her master bacon and eggs.
Well, look at it this way: Who's to know?
Master, wish for one big thing.
Jeannie, I don't need anything.
I Oh, it would make me so happy.
You do not even have to say it aloud.
Just think it.
But I don't want anything.
Really.
Please?
Come on, now, the biggest thing you can think of.
Uh Ready?
Yeah.
What are you going to do with that?
Yeah It was the biggest thing I could think of.
Major Nelson?
It's Doctor Bellows.
Get out of here, please?
And take him with you.
I will leave.
You may keep the elephant.
But wait Uh Oh, there you are, Major Nelson.
Hi, there.
I can't wait to hear your explanation of what you're doing with an elephant in your bedroom.
Uh, I'm glad you asked that, sir.
Uh, a friend of mine left him here?
Uh, and my next question is going to be: Why?
Ye Well, it's a very valuable animal, sir.
I mean, you just can't leave an elephant anywhere.
Uh, my friend takes him on safaris uh, uh, in Africa with him.
He insists that he stay indoors, sir.
You know how it is with animals.
Major, I want you to wait right here.
Do you understand?
Right here.
Jeannie.
Very funny.
Jeannie.
Oh, are you satisfied?
Well, it was you who wished for the elephant.
Would you mind getting rid of him?
If you wish.
What's this?
I did not know, master.
Were you thinking about a poodle?
Yeah, I guess I was.
When I was a kid, I had a little poodle called Tiger.
Hi, there, Tiger.
Hi, there.
Oh.
An elephant in his bedroom?
General Peterson, I saw it with my own eyes.
His name is Tiger.
Doctor, what would an elephant be doing in Major Nelson's bedroom?
With Major Nelson, anything is possible.
I repeat, general, anything.
You have no idea what I've been going through with him, sir.
But now I think we finally got his psyche pinned to the mat.
He'll never talk his way out of this one.
If this is another one of your wild goose chases Wild elephant chase, sir.
We're going on the biggest safari of them all: Bagging Major Nelson.
Oh, Doctor Bellows, General Peterson.
Sorry to barge in on you like this, Tony.
This will only take a minute, major.
He's in the bedroom, general.
Under the bed?
He was standing right there.
I swear he was.
This big.
Tony.
Yes.
Did you have an elephant in your bedroom?
Did I have an elephant in my bedroom?
Uh-uh, you're not gonna get out of this one, major.
You called him Tiger.
Tiger.
Tiger.
Oh, oh, Tiger.
Yes.
Now do you recall?
Yes.
Oh, yes, sir.
Here we are.
Here's Tiger.
He's a cute little fellow, huh?
That's Tiger?
So we're going on a safari to hunt wild elephants, are we?
Doctor, I want you in my office in 30 minutes.
And be prepared to spend the afternoon with me.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry to have bothered you, Tony.
Oh, that's quite all right, sir.
No bother at all.
It won't happen again.
You haven't heard the last of this.
You haven't heard the last of this, major.
Oh, general.
Jeannie.
You see?
I can help you.
How did I get in this spot in the first place?
I feel sorry for Doctor Bellows.
He's a very nice man.
Well, I'd feel sorry for him too, except for one thing: If he ever finds out about you, I'm gonna get thrown out of the space program.
Oh, could you not explain to him that you found me in a bottle on the beach?
Sure, that's Of course, of course.
And when I'm finished explaining it to him, he'll have me locked up.
Ha, ha.
They're back.
Hi.
Hi, Tony.
It's only you.
Boy, you sure know how to make a fellow feel welcome.
Hello, Captain Healey.
Hi, Jeannie.
How's tricks?
I have not had much time to practice them.
Well, you should've picked me for your master.
I'd keep you working Oh, I am very pleased with the master I have.
Thank you.
Well, if you should change your mind, remember I, uh, pay overtime.
Hey, what's that?
That's Tiger.
Hi, Tiger.
Uh, didn't I see Doctor Bellows and General Peterson leave here?
Yeah, yeah.
Doctor Bellows is seeing elephants.
Well, that's the psychiatry game for ya.
Well, we better be moving along.
They're running some films of yours on your space walk and some big brass is coming down from Washington, and, uh, they'd like us to be there.
Yeah, okay.
Um, I'll be home for dinner.
I shall fix something special, master.
When you're through, maybe you could mix me, uh, up a little something.
A little Maybe hors d'oeuvres.
And what do you wish for, little Tiger?
There you go.
Mmm.
There's Major Nelson ready to step off into space.
There he goes.
Major Healey, when you were at the controls and Major Nelson left the ship, did you notice any difference in the handling of the controls?
Well, when he stepped out, the ship yawed a bit, but it was easy to correct.
Major Nelson, did you have any problem adjusting to floating in space as opposed to floating in the capsule?
Well, I suppose there was a difference psychologically, sir.
Inside the capsule, you have a feeling of security, and outside, you wonder whether you're gonna float away.
I must say it was an exhilarating feeling.
It must have been.
I really envy you, major.
I can arrange for you to go along on one of our moon shots.
That's very kind of you, general, but I'm really swamped with work right here.
Well, if you gentlemen will come back to my office, I'll show you the new correlation charts we have on the moon probe.
All right.
All right.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
How's Tiger?
Tiger?
Oh, uh, fine.
Just fine.
Say hello to him for me, won't you?
Yes.
Your, uh, dinner is ready, master.
Okay, I'll I'll be with you in just a minute.
Soon as I finish these correlations.
Well, how about that.
Say, what are you all dressed up for?
I thought we were eating at home.
Oh, yes.
But I thought it might be nice if we dressed for it.
Ah, you look handsome, master.
Thanks.
Oh, you would look wonderful on the deck of your own yacht.
Jeannie, we've been through all this.
No yacht.
I don't know how I'm gonna make you understand.
I don't want anything else in the world except to be an astronaut.
Now why don't you just forget it, and we'll go down and enjoy your dinner.
Hmm?
If you say so, master.
That's what I wish.
Oh, you should see what I made for you.
I have a wonderful No, now, don't tell me.
I want it to be a surprise.
All right.
I can't get over that.
You just look wonderful.
It's probably Roger.
He's crazy about your cooking.
Uh Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Major.
This is, uh Uh, an unexpected pleasure.
Is it?
Yes.
Were you going out?
Going out, sir?
No, I was just having a little dinner here alone.
In a dinner jacket?
A dinner jacket?
Oh.
Ha, ha.
Uh, well, it's an old habit.
It, uh It makes the food taste better.
Oh.
Uh, are you going somewhere, sir?
Yes, you might say that.
I'm taking a trip that's long overdue.
Good, good.
I I mean, have a good time, sir.
Drop me a line if you get a chance.
I expect to have the most interesting time of my life.
Good.
Uh, may I ask where you're going?
Indeed you may, major.
Oh.
Did you say you were dining alone?
The table is set for two.
Two?
Oh, oh, you never know when a friend will drop in, do you?
Well, thanks for dropping in to say goodbye, sir.
Oh.
I haven't come to say goodbye.
You haven't?
No, major.
As a matter of fact, you might say that I've come to say hello.
I'm moving in with you.
This is really a bachelor's place, sir.
I don't know how comfortable I can make you.
Oh, the couch will be fine.
I'm not here to be comfortable.
Well, why are you here, sir?
Because General Peterson thinks I'm losing my mind.
But I'm gonna prove to him that I'm normal.
Uh, shall we, uh, go in to dinner?
Ahh!
Is that pheasant under glass?
Probably.
Truffles?
Rack of lamb?
Stuffed artichokes?
Who cooked this, major?
Oh, uh, we have a frozen-food market just  It's my housekeeper.
Ah.
You have a housekeeper?
Well, you don't think that I cooked this.
Oh, well, no, sir.
No, no, no.
Patricia is a marvelous cook.
Uh, but she doesn't like anyone in her kitchen, sir.
Patricia is very, uh Patricia, your housekeeper?
Pedro, my houseboy.
Pedro this is Doctor Bellows.
Hello, Doctor Bellows.
Hello, Pedro.
I was just complimenting Major Nelson on how marvelous the food looks.
Yes, uh, well, uh, I think we ought to go in and eat, sir Uh, tell me, where are you from, Pedro?
I was born in Paris.
Paris?
SÃ­.
That's why I'm so very good cook.
Yeah, we really ought to start eating, sir.
Uh, how long have you worked for Major Nelson?
Uh, he just started One year.
He just started a year ago.
I I think we ought to eat now.
Ai Chihuahua.
Is he gonna stay for dinner?
Uh, Pedro, he's not only staying for dinner.
He's moved in with me.
Pedro.
Now, Pedro.
Pedro.
Uh, I I told you, Pedro doesn't like anybody in his kitchen, sir.
He may be a marvelous cook, major, but he's dangerous.
I'd get rid of him if I were you.
Believe me, sir.
You've no idea how I've tried.
Coming, coming, coming.
Tony.
Is Is anything wrong?
I just acquired a permanent houseguest.
Three guesses.
Suzanne?
Doctor Alfred Bellows.
Oh.
Oh, you're kidding.
What are we going to do?
What are we going to do?
What are you It's your houseguest.
How did he happen to move in with you, anyway?
Well, he didn't happen to move in.
He moved in because he's suspicious.
Oh, there's nothing worse than a suspicious head shrinker.
I need your help.
Wait a minute, don't give him to me.
I'm not giving you him.
I'm giving you Jeannie.
You are?
Oh.
Oh, well, I'll drink to that.
Uh, just until I get rid of Dr. Bellows.
Remember, it's only for the duration.
Oh, what do you think I am?
I know what you are.
I'm taking a chance, anyway.
Fire.
Fire!
Fire.
Fire.
Fire!
I got it.
I got it.
What's going on?
I don't know, but whatever it is, I think we've gotten to the bottom of it.
It was a bottle.
A bottle?
What kind of a bottle?
I trailed the bottle over Oh.
Well, it's not a total loss.
You better get some rest, sir.
I don't understand it.
I I must have had a nightmare.
It was so real.
Yes.
These things happen.
Yes.
I'll I'll buy you a new lamp, of course.
Oh, no.
You don't have to bother, sir.
It was an antique.
Sir, uh, could we get some sleep now?
I have an awful rough day tomorrow.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
I'm I'm terribly sorry.
I Oh.
My nerves seem to be on edge.
Yeah.
Oh.
When I was a A small boy, my mother loved my younger brother more than she loved me.
I I didn't think I minded it at the time, but then as years went by, I began to resent it.
I didn't actually hate my brother, but I found myself working out ways to do away with him.
What is it?
What is it?
The Indians.
Huh?
Indians are coming.
Indians?
Listen, they're closing in.
Doctor, you've got to pull yourself together.
I am together.
I heard these footsteps.
Then this train was coming.
Then someone was breathing in my ear.
Then this lion roared.
Lion roared?
Yes.
That was just before the bomb start falling.
The bomb started falling?
Yes.
And then Ooh, then the tom-toms started.
They were on the warpath.
Yelling and screaming.
It was a nightmare.
Yeah, doctor, that's exactly what it was: A nightmare.
Now, you must get some sleep.
Sleep?
I wouldn't sleep in this house again if my life depended on it.
You wouldn't?
If you'll take my advice, you'll get out of here yourself.
In my opinion, this house is haunted.
Oh, you don't believe in ghosts, do you, sir?
Well, I didn't yesterday, but I do today.
Well, doctor, aren't you gonna get dressed?
There's no time.
They may be gathering for another attack.
Well  He's gone, master.
Yes, I know.
Oh, Jeannie.
You're marvelous.
I can't tell you how great it is to be alone again.
Good morning.
Hi, Roge.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Just call me master.
Master?
Well, temporarily, of course.
Well, look, since I'll be taking over for a while, I made out a little list of some of the things I'll need Roger, there's been a change in plans, for one thing.
First of all, I'd like some ski equipment, nothing elaborate.
About 15 outfits.
And I'd like Jeannie won't be staying with you, Roge.
Maybe someplace in the mountains with about 30 rooms, with a cute maid.
Roger, uh, I'm keeping Jeannie.
What?
I'm keeping Jeannie.
Doctor Bellows left.
Everything is all right.
What do you mean everything's all right?
I just lost a 30-room chalet, a 15-piece ski outfit and a cute maid.
All right.
Uh, Jeannie, could you give him the maid?
Certainly, master.
You mean you're gonna Oh, what a pal.
I'm Agnes.
I don't work on Sundays, and I take holidays off.
I don't do no heavy cleanin'.
And I cook only twice a week.
Now, the food's simple, so if you like it fancy, you can just go to a restaurant.
Besides that, I want two television sets.
One for the bedroom and one for the kitchen.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
How is the water, master?
Oh, wonderful, Jeannie.
Just wonderful.
Everybody should have their own swimming pool.
Get rid of it, will you?
Thanks, Jeannie.
lf you enjoy a swimming pool so much, master why do you not keep it?
Well, l don't think l could explain it to my neighbours.
Oh, well, l will get rid of them for you.
No, no.
No, l like my neighbours.
l really do.
Why don't you make a little breakfast?
Oh, and make it for two.
Major Healey's coming over.
Good.
l have not seen Major Healey in a long time.
Has he been away?
No.
No.
As a matter of fact, l haven't seen him much myself.
l think he's a little hurt because l haven't let him borrow you.
That's why l asked him over for breakfast this morning.
-Oh, there he is now.
-Well, l will tidy up.
-Good morning, Roge.
-Good morning.
-Did l get you out of a shower?
-No.
l've just been in for a swim.
-A swim?
-Good morning, Major Healey.
Oh.
Good morning, Jeannie.
-You're looking very well.
-Oh, thank you.
-Oh, thank you.
-You're a stranger around here, Roge.
l haven't seen you for two weeks.
Oh, thank you.
Has it been that long?
Sorry l couldn't make it for dinner last night.
Well, l got a little tied up.
You know how it is.
l. Would you like something else for breakfast, Major Healey?
l came by to tell you that l couldn't stay for breakfast.
You see, l'm going over to the bank to draw all my money out.
-What's wrong, Roge?
-Wrong?
What makes you think -anything's wrong?
-Because l know you.
And l think -l know what's bothering you.
-Let me in on it.
You're hurt because l won't let you borrow Jeannie.
-Hurt?
Me?
-l think l know how you feel.
And because you're a close friend l'm gonna let you borrow Jeannie this afternoon.
Oh, thanks anyway, Tony, but l don't want to borrow Jeannie.
You don't want to borrow Jeannie?
l found something that's better than a genie.
Well, l'm sorry l can't stay for breakfast.
Captain Nelson, what are you doing?
Taking out a 1 04, sir.
l'm taking it out this afternoon.
-You have a visitor.
-Well, Colonel Yeager.
-Hi, Tony.
-Very good to see you, sir.
Colonel Yeager was one of the pioneers in the space program.
-l had a good airplane, the X-1 .
-What are you doing here, sir?
Oh, looking over the facilities at the Cape.
And, incidentally, congratulations on your last space walk.
Thank you very much.
Where are you off to next, sir?
Oh, going down to Panama to look over our Jungle Survival School and just wanted to drop by and say hello.
-l appreciate it.
-Take good care of him, doc.
-Oh, l will.
l will.
-l'll see you, Tony.
Okay, sir.
Good seeing you.
-Hi, Roge.
-Hi, Tony.
Colonel Yeager was looking for you.
Did you see him?
Yeah.
Did you mean what you said this morning?
-What did l say this morning?
-That you had something -better than a genie.
-Oh, look, do me a favour, will you?
-Forget l mentioned it, huh?
-Oh, well Give me a clue.
How big is it?
Bigger than a breadbox.
Bigger than a breadbox and better than a genie?
Well, l wouldn't say she's better than a genie, but she's as good.
-She?
Go on.
-lf l tell you, you won't laugh?
-No.
-l have a fortuneteller.
A fortuneteller.
Well, thanks a lot.
Oh, come on, Roger.
A fortuneteller.
Look, l don't blame you.
l was sceptical myself.
When she told me where l was born and where l went to school-- She knew everything there was to know about me.
Roger, you're an astronaut.
Now, your picture has been in every newspaper in the world.
What about the things that aren't in print?
Fortunetellers are the greatest psychologists in the world.
They can tell by the expression on your face if they're on the right track.
And if they are, they just keep on going.
lf they're not, they pull back.
Look, you have your genie.
Let me keep my fortuneteller.
Sure.
All right.
l just don't wanna see you get hurt.
That's all.
-Where did you meet this?
-Madame Zolta?
-Yeah, Madame Zolta.
-What's so funny about that?
l met her coming out of my apartment.
She bumped into me.
She bumped into you?
l'd like to meet her, Roge.
l thought you weren't interested.
l changed my mind.
Think you could arrange it?
Well, she's giving me a reading this evening.
You could come along.
How about 8:00?
lt's a date.
Listen.
She's really going to impress you.
She already has.
l still do not understand why you must meet this fortuneteller, master.
l would be happy to read your stars for you.
Oh, thanks, Jeannie.
l don't want anybody to read my stars for me.
No, this is Roger's fortuneteller.
He thinks she's psychic.
And l think there's some kind of a swindle going on.
Oh, but, master, could it not be that she is psychic?
Psychic, my foot.
She's a con artist.
-A what?
-She's a fake, Jeannie.
She's not charging him for the readings.
That means she's after something bigger.
l'd like to know what it is.
Well, from what you say, Major Healey believes she is genuine.
Major Healey believes in fortune cookies.
-Oh, that's him.
-l will let him in.
Hello!
-Good evening, Major Healey.
-Oh.
Good evening, Jeannie.
Major Nelson has been telling me about your fortuneteller.
-Yeah, she's fantastic.
-Oh, l have known many wonderful fortunetellers.
-Have you really?
-Oh, yes.
-My friend Nossie used-- -Nossie?
Nostradamus.
He used to tell me many exciting things that came true.
They don't make them that way anymore.
All right, we better be going.
l'll be home early.
l wouldn't be too sure of that.
You may get so fascinated with her, you won't want to leave.
Well, l hardly think so, Roger.
-Good night, Jeannie.
-Good night, master.
l will wait up for you.
Say, have you heard anything about NASA expanding and buying more property around the base?
No.
No.
lsn't this your apartment?
Yeah, Madame Zolta lives right next door to me.
Oh, that's a coincidence, isn't it?
Boy, you sure are suspicious, aren't you?
Come in, Major Healey.
Hello, Madame Zolta.
l'd like you to meet a friend-- -Major Nelson.
-Hey, she knows who you are.
-Sit down.
-Thank you.
l hope l'm not intruding, madam.
Oh, but you're not intruding, major.
l was expecting you.
And when Madame Zolta says she's expecting you, she-- Oh, how about that?
Three cups.
-Major.
-Thank you.
And you take cream and one sugar.
Hey, how about that?
Do you see what l mean?
She knows.
-Remarkable, Roger.
-Major Nelson is a sceptic.
No, no, no.
That's not true.
He just came over here to meet you.
He came because he does not believe in me and he was worried about you.
Now, is that not true, major?
Well, let's say l came with an open mind.
-You are a Leo.
-Hey, that's right.
How about that?
l'm sure Madame Zolta reads newspapers, Roger.
You have a very inquiring mind.
You want to know why things happen.
That's true.
That's true.
That's also true of millions of people.
And you are very stubborn.
Once you are interested in a problem you will not let go until you have all the facts.
Oh, boy, has she got you down pat.
l have prepared your astrological chart for you.
l hope you do not mind.
No.
Not if it's not too expensive.
-There is no charge.
-No?
Well, l understand these take quite some time to prepare.
Doesn't matter.
l did it because l am very interested in you.
How did you know you were gonna meet me?
Perhaps l read it in the newspaper.
-TouchÃ©, Tony.
-May l see your hand, please?
-Which one?
-The one with the scar on it that you got climbing over your neighbour's barbed-wire fence.
-The right one.
-You didn't tell me about that.
Well, it happened when l was 7 years old.
l suppose she read about that in the newspapers.
Let us see what the crystal ball has to say.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Oh, you won't believe this.
This is really good.
Madame Zolta.
l'm afraid you're just wasting your time.
My friend Major Healey may be a little more gullible than l am.
l've had a little more experience.
And if there's one thing l'm sure of, it's that-- -That's me.
-Yes.
The crystal ball holds the past, the present and the future.
Yeah-- Hey, Roger, that's really me.
Don't touch it.
You will disturb the spirits.
Oh, sorry.
Now do you believe me?
l'm sorry, madam, l-- l must admit l was sceptical when l first came in here, but that's really amazing.
Do not apologize, major.
l have converted many unbelievers.
l'd certainly like to know a lot more about this.
l'm holding a sÃ©ance tomorrow night.
lf you care to attend, you are very welcome.
Oh, l'd like that very much.
Can you?
Can you contact the spirits?
lf the atmosphere is right.
Well, l have an aunt and uncle l lost a few years ago.
l'd very much like to speak to them.
Uncle Jeff and Aunt Susan.
-We will do what we can, major.
-Thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, l'm rather tired.
Oh, yes, yes, certainly.
l must say, l'm-- l'm terribly impressed.
l think that you will find the sÃ©ance tomorrow much more impressive.
-Good night.
-Good night.
Good night.
Roger -Good night.
-Good night.
-Good night.
See you tomorrow tonight.
-Thanks again.
Hakim.
lt was easy.
You really think you'll talk to your uncle Jeff and aunt Sue?
Oh, it's a possibility.
lf anybody can do it, Madame Zolta can.
-She's great.
-She better be.
l don't have an uncle Jeff or an aunt Sue.
Oh, hi, hi.
Jeannie-- -Yes, master.
-Well, could you come over here?
l need a-- -Oh, a crystal ball.
-Yeah.
Oh, master, do you mind if l use it to look up some of my old friends?
Jeannie, it's not a telephone book.
lt's just a piece of glass.
But you told me that Madame Zolta made you appear in her crystal ball as a small boy, so l do not see any reason why l can't-- Yes, yes, l know.
But that's just a trick she does.
And l think l figured out how she does it.
Now, l need a photograph of a man and a woman.
Oh, thanks.
Yeah.
That's good.
lt's a little modern.
Could you make them about 20 years older?
Yeah.
That's it.
That's it.
Okay, now let's see, what do l do fir-- Oh, here.
Oh, Jeannie, could you plug this in, please?
Now, let's see.
Yeah, this ought to do it.
What are you doing, master?
l am putting my uncle Jeff and my aunt Susan in a crystal ball.
Abracadabra, Zelamizoo You're uncle Jeff and auntie Sue lt works.
That's really great.
You'd never think they'd been dead for 20 years, would you?
-No.
-You certainly wouldn't.
-Hello, Dr. Bellows.
-What's that?
Well, that's just a crystal ball.
Just a crystal ball?
And those people in it have been dead for 20 years?
-Oh, no.
They're not real, sir.
-They're spirits.
Well, certainly you don't believe in spirits, sir?
And you can summon them any time you want to?
Oh, no, no.
You see this is an experiment we're doing in the astrolab.
The important thing is that-- -Oh, major.
-Yes.
You just wait right here.
A crystal ball?
His aunt Sue and uncle Jeff were in it, sir.
They've been dead for 20 years.
Doctor, do you know what l think?
l think it's time you had a long vacation.
l swear l saw it with my own eyes, general.
The crystal ball is on his desk right this minute.
With his aunt Sue and uncle Jeff in it?
That's right.
Let's go.
Jeannie.
That's it, Jeannie.
That's how she does it.
Somehow Madame Zolta got a picture of me as a small boy and she puts it under the crystal ball, then shines a light up through it.
Oh, but why should she go to all that trouble, master?
lt's so much better to do it the easy way.
Yeah-- Well, l don't know.
l'm going to find out at the sÃ©ance tonight.
And l'm gonna take this picture with me.
Master, l went to a sÃ©ance once at Cleopatra's palace.
And l remember, the medium told Mark Antony that if he didn't watch out-- -Jeannie.
-What?
-Oh, general.
-There it is, sir.
Tony, what is this?
Sir?
That's a paperweight, sir.
Your aunt and uncle aren't in it.
What would my aunt and uncle be doing in a paperweight, sir?
They were there a minute ago, sir.
You know, major: ''Abracadabra Zelamizoo It's Uncle Jeff And Auntie Sue'' That's very nice.
What have you done with your uncle Jeff and your aunt Sue?
l haven't done anything with them, sir.
l don't have an uncle Jeff or an aunt Sue.
You don't have an uncle Jeff or an aunt Sue?
l could start my vacation Monday, general.
Will there be many people at this sÃ©ance?
Oh, half a dozen or so.
lt has been a long time since l have been to a sÃ©ance.
l'm afraid you can't go to this one, Jeannie.
l'm gonna be busy enough without having to worry about you.
That's Roger's car.
Roger, come on in!
lt's open.
-Good evening, Major Healey.
-Hi, Jeannie.
Hi.
-All set for Madame Zolta?
-All set.
Master, what does this Madame Zolta look like?
Well, it's hard to tell.
She wears those big flowing robes, you know.
Hard to tell?
Are you kidding?
-She's one of the most beautiful-- -Roger.
Well, it's hard to tell what she looks like in those big flowing robes.
We better get going.
Jeannie, promise me you'll be a good girl.
l promise you that l am going to be a good girl.
lsn't she wonderful?
lf l'm ever elected president l am going to see that everyone has one.
Enjoy yourself.
l always enjoy myself at a sÃ©ance.
Boy, am l gonna have a big fat apology coming from you.
-Good evening.
-Oh, good evening.
Major Nelson, Major Healey, this is Hakim.
How do you do?
l trust your arm is better, major.
Oh, it's much better, thank you.
l just had a little touch of-- Hey, l didn't tell her about my arm hurting.
Well, maybe it's the way you hold it, Roger.
Madam, l've had a little time to think about what you did.
And, well, frankly, l find it almost impossible to believe.
l am glad that you're sceptical, major.
-My delight will be that much keener.
-Oh, excuse me, sir.
-Let me-- -Yeah, oh, it's my fault.
Let me introduce you to other seekers of the truth.
-Major Healey.
-We met before.
Major Nelson.
Miss Gordon.
-Mrs. Bates.
-How do you do?
Hello.
How do you do?
My pleasure.
All of us have been brought here by a common desire: the wish to explore the unknown.
Now there are sceptics among us and l welcome them on behalf of myself and those dear spirits to whom we shall soon be speaking.
-lt's kind of spooky, isn't it?
-Oh, yes.
There is nothing to be frightened of.
-This is your first sÃ©ance, major?
-Yes.
l think l can promise you an unforgettable experience.
l think, with a little luck it'll be an unforgettable experience for everybody.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Oh, that's quite all right.
lt's my fault.
-Please be seated.
-Thank you.
Yes.
-What are you doing here, sir?
-Major Healey told me about the sÃ©ance.
l've come to meet your aunt and uncle.
My aunt and uncle?
Oh, madam, this is-- Dr. Alfred Bellows.
Yes.
Won't you join us?
lsn't this exciting?
This is my third sÃ©ance this week.
-How wonderful.
-Yes.
Dim the lights, please, Hakim.
Let us join hands.
And there's no one here but us and our unseen friends who will soon make themselves visible to those who wish to see them.
l'm about to go into a trance.
l warn you, no matter what you hear or see do not let go of the hands you are holding.
l am a bridge into the unknown.
There are those here who wish to communicate with their departed dear ones.
l sink into the nothingness of eternity.
We are calling to you, O spirits.
Hear us and come to us.
You do not come.
Are you angry?
ls it because there is an unbeliever among us?
-Boy, this is spooky, isn't it?
-lsn't it?
But he wishes to believe, O spirit.
He needs a sign.
Perhaps if he could see some of his departed loved ones.
Look, Tony, look.
-l see.
l see.
-lt's your uncle and aunt.
Hello out there.
lf anyone recognizes the spirits, speak.
Tony?
My darling nephew?
Hello, Aunt Sue.
You look wonderful.
Hello, my boy.
lt's good to see you.
Uncle Jeff, how are you?
How is everything in the old country?
What did you say?
l said, how is everything in the old country, you big bag of ectoplasm?
He does not mean to be disrespectful, O spirit.
Oh, we must go now, Tony.
But Madame Zolta will tell you -how to find us again.
-No, no, Uncle Jeff, don't go.
Don't go.
l'd like to have a chat with you about the family.
They're calling us back.
What?
Don't they give you a coffee break?
-We shall return.
-Please do.
l knew them in Chicago.
We will compose our souls with celestial music.
Would anyone else like to commune with a loved one?
Yes, l would.
Are you there, dear Herbert?
l think l can feel Herbert coming to you.
-Herbert!
-Herbert?
Something strange is happening.
Spirits?
ls that you, spirits?
l've done it.
l've done it!
l've brought the spirits.
Hello.
Hello, spirits.
This is Madame Zolta.
Do you have anything to say to me?
Yes, Madame Zolta.
Look!
-Spirits.
-Yeah.
-Let's get out of here.
-Yeah.
Sure.
Where's Dr. Bellows?
Oh, he's fainted.
Okay, doc.
We'll take care of you, doc.
Now, if you just give me a chance-- l still don't understand what they're after.
l talked to a police-lieutenant friend of mine and he says that Madame Zolta is a member of a ring that's swindling people in a real-estate deal.
lt seems that she softens up her clients by telling them somebody is going to come along with a fantastic real-estate deal.
And then one of her confederates steps in and sells them a lot of worthless land.
Yeah, but why pick on me?
l'm not rich.
Well, there's been a rumour going around that NASA's going to expand.
Of course, that would make all the property around the base worth a fortune.
And they wanted that inside information.
You mean, she wasn't psychic after all?
Roger, you've got to stop believing in crystal balls.
Oh, but they can predict the future, master.
-Oh, Jeannie.
-Well, look.
Look.
Jeannie, what's going on?
Wait a minute.
What--?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Hey, wait a minute.
Jeannie, come on, let me out of here.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
You see?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
I finished cleaning the living room, master.
Now Now, be careful, Jeannie.
This is my painting arm.
Oh, you finished the living room.
Mm-hm.
Sorry.
Ten seconds.
Wonderful.
Well, my cousin Marilla could do it in six.
Oh, that's all right, Jeannie.
I'm very happy with you just the way you are.
Oh, thank you, master.
Oh, your picture is beautiful.
You really think so?
Oh, yes.
Where will you hang it?
Well, I'm not gonna hang it anyplace, Jeannie.
Well, then why are you painting it?
Well, all the astronauts are doing paintings for the Air Force benefit show.
They're gonna auction them off.
Yours will be the best.
I, uh I hardly think so.
We have some very good Sunday painters.
There we are.
I don't think that's any competition for Rembrandt.
Uh Uh Here's the original.
I just hope the critics don't laugh.
You know, he was a wonderful painter.
Oh.
I just wish I could paint like him.
Oh, I have the strangest feeling, master.
Oh?
Of what?
I think the critics are going to love your painting.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Ah.
Ah.
Good morning, Michelangelo.
Rembrandt.
Oh, Michelangelo, Rembrandt.
If you've You've seen one, you've seen them all.
How do you like it?
Well, I don't know.
Uh, it's a pleasant, little entry.
I'd like to see more grays and blues.
Well, the reason I didn't put the grays and blues What am I discussing this with you for?
You don't know the difference between a Michelangelo and a Rembrandt.
Well, I may not know art, but I know what I like.
This is my little, uh, entry over here.
Ha-ha.
How do you like it?
Get over here in the light.
Right there.
Now, what do you think?
Uh what is it?
It's an abstract.
And I bet my painting brings a bigger price than your painting.
Yeah, w I know this is for charity, Roger, but that's ridiculous.
Well, we'll let our public decide, okay?
Ah, good morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.
Ah, well, I see you brought your paintings in.
Oh, don't let me disturb you, major.
Uh, this is Major Nelson's, uh, painting here, sir, and this is, um Not bad.
Not bad at all.
I think I would've liked to have seen more grays and blues.
Ah-ha.
Hm.
This is my little entry, sir.
It's, uh, nothing really.
Just a little, uh Oh, you're wrong, major.
Do you really like it?
Oh, definitely.
I'd say it was a triumph of, uh matter over mind.
Well, I'll see you gentlemen at the auction.
Yes.
Matter over mind.
I don't know.
Hey, it must be even greater than I thought.
Oh, boy!
Ha.
Rembrandt.
Well, I'll, uh, see you at the auction, okay?
All right, Roge.
Hello.
Goodbye.
But I just got here.
And you're just leaving.
Now, go home.
Oh!
But I wanna see your painting auctioned off.
The last auction I went to was in Mesopotamia, and they were selling slaves, and Oh, it was so exciting!
Now, Jeannie We're not selling slaves.
This is not a professional auction.
We're just amateurs, you understand?
No, if any of our paintings sell for more than $100, it'll be a miracle.
Oh.
I think your painting is worth far more than $100, master.
You're prejudiced.
A little.
I am very fond of Rembrandt.
Well, I'm hardly a Rembrandt.
Now, you You better go home and finish your housecleaning.
Oh, but I have finished cleaning the house.
Thirty-seven seconds.
Thirty-seven seconds?
No kidding?
Well, that's a record.
Yeah But, uh, see I can't have you around here, Jeannie.
Uh, why don't you go out to lunch someplace.
Oh, well All right.
I know a wonderful restaurant in Atlantis.
Don't get wet.
I won't.
Goodbye, master.
Bye.
I think you are going to enjoy your auction.
General Peterson asked me to express his appreciation to you for coming down here and helping us with our auction.
We're very fortunate in having two of the foremost art experts in the world here.
It's all in the name of charity, Dr. Bellows.
Yes, indeed.
Sweet charity.
Where would you like me to put this, sir?
Here, let me see it.
Hm.
Not bad.
Do you really like it, sir?
The frame.
The thing in it?
Why don't you, uh, hang it on the wall over there, major.
Yes, sir.
Amateur.
Oh, excuse me.
Well, now, I think we'd better get this auction started.
Oh, I hope I'm not late, sir.
Ah, no, no, no.
You're You're We're just about ready to begin.
Now, uh, this is Major Nelson.
Uh, Dr. Van Weesen.
How do you do?
I am Dean Geller.
How do you do, sir?
A pleasure.
Uh, where do I put this, sir?
Well, oh, anywhere over there.
Another abstract?
Oh, no, no, no.
This is a copy of a Rembrandt.
Uh, the amateurish quality comes through, of course.
Of course.
Anyone can see that, uh VAN  Second-rate.
Very second-rate.
Oh, yes.
It is definitely second-rate.
Well, I'll just hang it up over here.
Oh, let me help you.
I'll take care of it for the major.
No, that's quite unnecessary.
Oh, allow me.
I do know how to hang a picture.
Please, allow me.
I'm sorry to insist Gentlemen.
I'm afraid they're very nice, aren't they?
Um, how would you like to be our auctioneer, major?
Uh, me, sir?
Well, I don't really know anything about it.
Oh, there's nothing to it.
You, um You find a few kind words to say about each painting.
Uh, you may have to lie a little, but  And then you get the bidding started.
Well, I'll give it a try if you want me to.
Thank you.
Uh, right over here?
Yes, right there.
You know, this isn't just a copy of a Rembrandt.
It looks to me like a deliberate forgery.
And not a very clever one.
The, uh, brush strokes are all wrong.
And the frame new.
And everyone knows that the original of this painting is hanging in the Louvre.
Still, it would be nice to have as a conversation piece.
Yes, wouldn't it?
Ladies and gentlemen, uh, may I have your attention, please?
Uh, I'd like to start the auction now, and, uh And bear with me.
I'm kind of new at this.

Neo-primitive school?

I had no idea you were that interested in the Air Force Benevolent Fund.
Three hundred thousand dollars.
And that is my highest price.
Three hundred thousand?
Take it.
Uh, this painting is going for $300,000 once $300,000 twice Going thrice!
Well, congratulations.
Your painting brought more than my painting, and you nosed me out by $299,950.
I don't know what happened, Roge.
The people just went crazy.
Three hundred thousand dollars.
Well, maybe they figured because it was for a charity, they could use it as a tax write-off.
Hey, maybe that's it.
Yeah.
Hey, where are you gonna hang my painting?
I don't know.
I haven't decided yet.
Treat it gently, won't you?
Come in.
Major Nelson?
Yes.
Dr. Bellows would like to see you in the laboratory right away.
Oh, thank you very much.
My pleasure, major.
I'd like to see her in a laboratory.
I wonder what Dr. Bellows wants.
Probably painting lessons.
Hm.
Very interesting, that.
You see?
Come in.
Oh, pardon me.
Uh, you want to see me, doctor?
I certainly do, major.
Would you mind turning the lights on, please.
Oh, yeah.
There's no doubt about it.
This is a genuine Rembrandt.
Oh, no, sir.
The That's a genuine Anthony Nelson.
Believe me.
I painted it myself.
Oh, did you, major?
Then perhaps you'd mind telling me where you got canvas Oh, well, I didn't know it was that old.
I just found it lying around the garage.
This pigment is at least Can you explain that, major?
Well, really there's nothing to explain, sir.
Uh, t-t-the art dealer sold me a bunch of old pigment.
I I think you gentlemen are making a ridiculous mistake.
Major Nelson, I am perhaps the world's foremost authority on Rembrandt.
Harmenszoon van Rijn.
His brush strokes are as familiar to me as my wife's face.
Uh, w I don't know about your wife's face, but those brush strokes are mine.
B-besides, isn't the original hanging in the Louvre?
We thought that it was.
The one in the Louvre must be a fake.
There is no question about the authenticity of this painting.
Are you beginning to get the picture, major?
But, sir, I-I-I I don't know anything about art.
I just know what I painted.
Now Oh, look, I-if you'll just go look at the bottom right-hand corner of this, that you'll see that Rembrandt has signed it: "Rembrandt".
C Jeannie Harmenszoon.
Yeah.
Now, major, you're going to tell us where you got this painting.
Well, I'm a I'm afraid I can't, sir.
And I'm afraid you'll have to.
You see, major, if you painted this picture and signed it Rembrandt and sold it, you're guilty of conspiracy and grand larceny.
On the other hand, if you didn't paint it, and it's the original Rembrandt that was hanging in the Louvre, then you're guilty of theft.
And grand larceny.
And grand larceny.
I can't wait to hear what your choice is.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
This is your master calling, Jeannie.
Where are you?
Hi, Jeannie.
Oh, hello.
What are you doing?
I am painting a van Gogh.
Oh, isn't Rembrandt good enough for you?
Did the auction go well, master?
Oh, no, it went great.
I can't tell you what a sensation my painting caused.
Oh, I am glad.
What did you get for it?
About 30 years.
Oh.
I do not understand.
Jeannie, it's against the law to go around painting original Rembrandts.
But why?
He painted so beautifully.
Because they're gonna put me in jail for it.
Dr. Bellows has given me until tomorrow morning to explain that painting, and I couldn't explain it in a million years.
Oh, I am sorry, but, but But I I only did it because Well, because you said you wished you could paint as well as Rembrandt.
Will you stop listening to me?
Tony?
Tony!
Yeah, I'm I'm up here, Roger.
Hi, Jeannie.
Hi, Tony.
Hey, h I just figured out what must've happened.
Well, look, you You painted the picture, Jeannie blinked and turned it into the real thing.
Brilliant!
From now on, we'll call you Rembrandt.
Oh, Roger, ah-ha!
That's fu That's about as funny as a court martial.
And that's exactly what's gonna happen to me if I don't explain that thing by tomorrow morning.
Well, why don't you tell him the truth.
That's always the best thing.
Just tell them that Jeannie Court martial, huh?
Well, look, why don't you have Jeannie paint another Rembrandt, and then everyone'll be confused.
Oh, I will be happy to.
No.
I'd still be in trouble.
Why don't you have somebody say the picture's a fake.
Well, I thought of that.
It wouldn't work.
Oh, how do you know it will not work?
Because Dr. Bellows is flying over Pierre Millay from Paris.
Pierre Millay?
Yeah.
Yeah!
No kidding?
Who Who's he?
Pierre Millay is the art expert at the Louvre.
He's He's the world's foremost expert on art.
Oh, boy.
Well, the world is gaining a Rembrandt, but losing an astronaut.
Are you standing there telling me Major Nelson painted a Rembrandt?
Well, of course he didn't really paint it, general.
He pretended to.
But I have two art experts who swear that it's genuine.
Art experts have been known to make mistakes.
Oh, I'm aware of that, sir.
So I've taken the liberty of flying in the greatest art expert in the world: Pierre Millay, from the Louvre.
And if he says it's genuine?
Then Major Nelson will have to explain what he's doing with a stolen Rembrandt.
And once he does that, then I think we can make him explain a lot of other mysterious things that have been happening around here.
I've waited a long time for this day, general.
Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
Monsieur Millay will be here any minute.
Shall we go?
Um, I don't think it'll be necessary, sir.
There's something I want to tell you.
Oh, I'm sure there is.
But I don't want to hear it.
You You don't want to hear it?
That's right, major.
This time, you're gonna make your explanation in front of General Peterson.
I want him to hear it.
Yeah, but, sir, really Uh, major, the general is waiting.
I want you to know I don't believe a word of this, Tony, but since Dr. Bellows is making an issue of it, it's my duty to get to the bottom of it.
Yeah I understand, sir, and, uh, there's no point in waiting for Mr. Millay any longer.
I may as well tell you that, uh Well, this painting Ah, Monsieur Millay!
Ah, you must be Dr. Bellows.
Yes.
How kind of you to come all this way.
As you Americans say, the wild horses could not keep me away.
This is General Peterson.
How do you do?
Monsieur.
And this is Major Anthony Nelson Monsieur.
Alias, Rembrandt.
But if this is a joke, I do not understand it.
Oh, you will, Monsieur Millay.
You will.
Are you ready to make your confession now, major?
Oh.
Well, I I may as well, sir.
You see, this picture is really a A fake.
What did you say?
It is a fake.
A fraud.
Uh How you say?
Uh A phony.
A-are you trying to tell us that, uh, this is not a genuine Rembrandt?
That is what I am saying.
But I have two experts who say it's genuine.
And I I, who am the greatest art expert in the world I tell you it is a fake.
A child could see it like this.
This could have been painted by By him.
Ye Oh, yes.
As a matter of fact, it was.
Doctor.
Yes, general.
I've done it again.
Since you said all the time that you painted it, and since the money was for charity, there's no fraud involved.
Do you agree with me, Dr. Bellows?
Well, I, uh Yes, general.
I think there's something you'd like to say to Major Nelson, uh, isn't there?
I, uh I apologize, major.
Oh, that's all right, sir.
Everybody makes mistakes.
And some of us make more than others.
I'm sorry you had to come all this way, uh, for nothing, Monsieur Millay.
But it was not for nothing, monsieur.
Here is my bill.
Five hundred dollars?
Make the check out to your favorite charity.
Why, yes, doctor.
You could make your personal donation to the Air Force Benevolent Fund.
Oh, but, general, I I'll see you in my office, immediately.
Oh, uh   Did I do well, master?
Oh, Jeannie!
You were wonderful.
I'm glad you're pleased.
I'm just sorry for poor Dr. Bellows.
Now, you pop out of here and go home.
I'm gonna take you out tonight, and we're gonna celebrate.
That would be wonderful, master.
I'll bet I could've been a pretty good painter at that.
Ah, pardon.
Could you help me, please?
I am looking for the office of Dr. Bellows.
Oh, certainly.
Make a left turn at the end of the corridor, and it's the first door on the right.
Merci.
Hey, hey!
Come in here.
I can't have you wandering around these halls.
I want you to go home.
You want me to go home?
Oh, uh, t Take off your beard, and put on your prettiest dress.
Take off my beard and get into my prettiest dress?
You and I are going dancing tonight.
Hey, monsieur.
Oh, and, uh, drop the phony accent.
I'm amazed you got away with it.
That art expert act of yours was one of the best I've ever seen.
I I wish I had a picture of the expression on their face  You Wha Welcome to America, Mr. Millay.
Can I take your hat, sir?
Uh, Major Nelson, I You still here?
Still here?
But I just got here.
And there was no one to meet me at the airport.
Oh, that's too bad, but I'll see to it that someone takes you out to the airport to catch the next plane back to France.
Catch the next plane back to France?
But I flew 3000 miles in order to see our genuine Rembrandt.
I'm sorry we had to disappoint you, sir.
If you want my candid opinion, Monsieur Millay, as an art critic, you're highly overrated.
Carl was right.
All Americans are crazy!
I go home!
Monsieur.
Uh, art expert.
Well, at At least he can tell a phony Rembrandt when he sees one.
Mm.
Oh, there's one thing that's been bothering me, Major Nelson.
Yes, uh, just before we went in to see, uh, General Peterson, uh, you were about to make a confession.
Oh, oh, ye Yes.
Yes.
And, um, I was, um, uh Just wondering, uh, what it was.
Uh Oh!
Ah, yes.
I just wanted to tell you that, um Uh, yes?
Yes?
I I didn't think I'd ever really be a Rembrandt.
And then when I said I wanted to dance with him, he turned white.
Oh, I don't blame him.
You're a terrible dancer.
Oh, poor Dr. Bellows.
They are sending him away for a long rest.
Well, I think he deserves a rest.
Hey, have you decided where you're going to hang my painting yet?
Yeah.
Right there.
Right there?
Right Right Right where?
Right there Jeannie.
Oh, very funny.
Well, I still don't know why no one bid on my picture.
Oh, perhaps they are not yet ready for you, Major Healey.
Well, maybe you're right.
I really enjoyed painting that picture.
It was the most relaxing thing I ever did.
Then you must paint more often, master.
Yeah, but it looks so easy.
I wish I knew how Rembrandt did it.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Jeannie, would you like part of the paper?
Oh, master.
Oh, thank you, master.
The newspapers remind me of the old days.
-The old days?
Really?
-Two thousand years ago.
Nothing but floods, wars and juvenile delinquency.
-Master!
Oh, look, look!
-What?
The museum is having an exhibit from Bukistan.
-How about that?
-Master, l used to live in Bukistan.
-Oh, please take me.
-What, to Bukistan?
No.
To the museum.
Well, l'm not really very much for museums.
And besides, l'm not even dressed.
When l opened my mouth, l knew l shouldn't have said it.
-Shall we go, master?
-You've talked me into it.
Oh, this is it.
l'm so excited.
l could spend days here.
Well, l can only give you l've got to be back at the base.
-Master, look at that sword.
-Yeah.
Oh, they do not make them like that anymore.
Yeah, l hope not.
Look at that sword.
-My slippers!
-What's the matter with your slippers?
Oh, no, no, no, master.
Those slippers in the case.
They are mine.
Those are my favourite slippers.
No, no.
How could they be your slippers, Jeannie?
They belonged to a Princess Muphista, whoever she was.
l know who she was.
She was a fat thief.
And l want my slippers back.
Would you mind lowering your voice?
These people are staring.
But they are mine.
Well, slippers are slippers.
They probably just look like yours.
Oh, no, master.
You see there, where the tassel is missing?
That happened when the caliph and l danced and he stepped on my foot.
And come on.
Come on over here.
-See that broken place near the heel?
-Yeah.
Well, that happened when l became angry and l threw the slipper at the princess.
Oh, believe me, master.
l would know those slippers anywhere.
And l must have them back.
No, no, no, Jeannie.
You mustn't.
They don't belong to you anymore.
They're on loan from Bukistan.
How can the Bukistan government loan what belongs to me?
Jeannie, that's just the point.
You see, they don't belong to you anymore.
l'm sorry.
l'm terribly sorry.
Come on.
Nice museum.
Wonderful exhibit.
You are right, master.
Why make a fuss about a pair of Yeah.
-Good morning, Major Nelson.
-Oh, hello, Alice.
You never call me anymore.
Well, l'm sorry.
l'm engaged in a little experimental work.
Experimenting, huh?
See you later.
A robbery by someone in this base?
That's hard to believe.
Nothing shocks a psychiatrist.
Hello, major.
Tony, have you heard about the big robbery?
No, but if it's somebody here, l hope they catch him.
-Oh, we'll catch him, all right.
-What was stolen, sir?
Some joker broke into the museum and stole a valuable pair of old slippers that were on exhibit.
-Old slippers, huh?
-Yes.
They were 2000 years old, and priceless.
The museum guard says that an officer left just before the slippers were discovered missing.
He's sure he can identify him.
-lsn't that a lucky break?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.
Very lucky.
We have a list of the officers who were off duty at the time of the robbery.
We're gonna check that list out very carefully.
-By tonight, he'll probably be in prison.
-Probably.
l can tell you right now who the thief is.
-Oh, you can, sir?
-Yes, l certainly can.
The man we're looking for is a psychopath.
-Psychopath?
-Really--?
A psychopath, sir?
With a fetish for women's shoes.
A fet-- How do you know that, sir?
There were things much more valuable and yet the thief took only the slippers.
l know this sounds far-fetched, but couldn't it be possible the thief was trying to reclaim his rightful property?
Oh, come now, Major Nelson.
A pair of 2000-year-old slippers?
No, no, no.
The man we're looking for is desperate, cunning and ingenious.
And we're going to find him.
Oh, yeah.
Well, if there's anything l can do to help, sir, why, just let me know.
After all, they're just slippers.
ls this worth all the fuss over it?
No, it might be only a pair of slippers to you, Major Nelson but to the Bukistanian government, it's a national insult.
-An insult.
-l've just been with General Peterson.
The Bukistanian ambassador has lodged a formal protest and informed the State Department that unless those slippers are returned within the next 24 hours they're going to consider this theft a deliberate affront to their government.
You know something, sir, l don't blame them.
What are you, some kind of expert in international affairs?
Excuse me, sir, l've got some work to do.
What did l say?
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Young lady, l wanna have a little talk to you.
Are they not beautiful, master?
And they fit perfectly.
l was afraid that my feet might have grown in 2000 years.
Do you know what you've done to me?
l have done nothing to you, master.
You've done nothing to--?
lf you don't give those back, l'll go to jail the U.S. is gonna go to war with Bukistan.
But they belong to me, master.
Jeannie, you are missing the point.
That exhibition was on loan.
The United States government was responsible for those slippers.
And they took good care of these for me.
l'm grateful.
But would you not think they would at least have put the tassel back on, master?
You're not listening to me.
l want those slippers back in a glass case.
As you wish, master.
Aren't they lovely?
Not-- Not there.
l want them in a museum.
Jeannie, you're gonna return those slippers now.
l like it when you are forceful, master.
Sometimes you have to be.
l would do anything to make you happy, master.
-That's my girl.
-Except return these slippers.
Now, wait a minute.
Listen, l-- l cannot tell you how much l love them.
l must buy something to go with them.
How about the pyramids?
That is a wonderful idea!
No, no, no.
l take it back.
Look, l'll tell you what l'll do.
lf you give me those slippers l'll buy you a dozen pair just like it, huh?
No, master.
l will keep these.
l'll.
l'll let you drive the car, Jeannie.
You love that, huh?
Huh?
No, master.
Well, l'll-- l'll take you dancing.
How about that, huh?
No, master.
l will keep these slippers.
This time, Jeannie, l'm afraid l'm going to have to insist.
Jeannie, you cut that out!
Come on, cut it out!
-Oh, you.
-Jeannie!
Now, come on.
Jeannie, you come out of there.
Now, l mean it.
Jeannie, this is your master speaking.
Can you hear me?
l'm gonna count to three.
One, two, th-- Has Dr. Bellows called you yet?
No.
Why should he call me?
You know those men he was talking about?
Dr. Bellows asked the museum guard to come look at some of the men and they've got the list down to three men.
Tony, what would you want with a pair of old slippers?
l mean, it goes terrible with your uniform.
Roger.
Well, l mean, l'm just saying that-- Jeannie?
That's right.
The slippers are Jeannie's.
She ran across them at the museum.
Tell her to give them back.
She's supposed to obey you.
l know she's supposed to obey me but she doesn't know that.
l made a big mistake when l found her.
l said she was free.
Why couldn't l have picked up an everyday, normal male genie?
Well, what are you gonna do?
l'm-- l'm gonna let her keep the slippers.
-You're what?
-Yeah, yeah.
Sure, sure.
Why not?
l'm gonna let her keep them.
They're hers.
They belong to her.
She should keep them.
-After all, what's fair is fair, right?
-Fair is fair.
What's fair is fair.
'' l am going to trick--'' Roger, l have a lot to do right now.
We all got a lot to do.
Right?
Sure.
Listen, if anybody calls, don't answer, right?
-Thanks a lot.
-Nice talking to you.
Jeannie, you can come out now.
Oh, thank you, master, but l'm very comfortable in here.
Well, l-- l'll just make an early night of it.
l'll get a little sleep.
-Good night, Jeannie.
-Good night, master.
Well, good morning, Rififi.
How's the international slipper thief?
Well, l'll tell you how l am.
lf l don't get those slippers back, l'm gonna start a war with Bukistan.
-l thought you were gonna trick her.
-l tried.
lt didn't work.
l tried to get her out of the bottle.
She wouldn't budge.
What's she being so unreasonable about?
She's not, really.
When you come down to it, they are her slippers.
l feel like a heel trying to get them.
You've got an interesting choice.
You can be a live heel or a dead hero.
lf Bellows can prove you're mixed up in this he'll nail you to his wall as a trophy.
l'm not really worried about Dr. Bellows.
You see-- Yes?
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Can l come over to your office right away?
No.
l mean, l can as soon as l finish the job l'm in the middle of.
Well, it-- lt shouldn't take too long, sir.
At least l hope not.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
l'll be over.
l have an uncle in the insurance business.
lf you'd like a letter of recommendation, why, l-- lf l can get those slippers back before my meeting with Bellows they'll be so happy, they won't care who stole them.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
Jeannie?
Hello, master.
Did you sleep well?
Oh, yes, I did.
And--?
And you?
Oh, l slept very well, thank you.
Jeannie, l've been thinking.
l-- l really think you ought to keep the slippers.
-You do?
-Of course.
After all, they're yours.
Thank you, master.
And to celebrate, l'm gonna take you and Roger to lunch.
Oh, l will enjoy that.
Roger always wanted to go to Maxim's in Paris.
l did?
l did.
Oh, yeah.
l love French food.
Of course, when l first tried it, France was called Gaul.
Can you imagine going into a restaurant and asking for some Gaul-fried potatoes?
Jeannie, naturally we couldn't take you out dressed like that.
Oh, well, that is no problem.
Hey, hey!
Does this look better, master?
-Very nice.
-That's wonderful, Jeannie.
You know, l don't think the slippers go with that outfit, though.
l like the slippers with the outfit.
Why don't you change your shoes and you can leave your slippers here in my drawer?
For safekeeping.
Well, if you are sure that nothing will happen to them.
Well, what could possibly happen to them in my office?
Very well then.
Are these better, master?
Oh, those are beautiful.
Aren't they, Roge?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Thank-- Thank you.
Well, that's taken care of.
-Listen, l'm starved.
Can we go now?
-Boy, so am l. -Hungry.
-Overseas operator.
Why are you calling the overseas operator?
l'm calling Maxim's to make a reservation.
You just can't walk in.
That will not be necessary, master.
l can make a reservation.
-How?
-l will go there and make it.
-l don't wanna put you to any trouble.
-lt is no trouble, master.
-l will not be gone long.
-Well-- Boy, this is the greatest idea you've ever had.
l've never been to Maxim's before.
l'm hungry too.
What are you doing?
l'm gonna take these back to that museum.
We're not going to Maxim's?
Roger, get with it, will you?
l never thought l'd see these again.
And we've gotta work fast.
We've gotta work fast?
l've gotta do it before my meeting with Dr. Bellows.
Since we're not going to Maxim's, can we get a cheeseburger?
He's got the stolen slippers in a shoebox.
-That's right, general.
-l don't believe it.
l saw it myself.
lf you'll come to his office right now, you'll catch him.
Doctor, if you're wasting my time again-- General, if l'm wasting your time, l'll eat the shoebox.
Let's go.
How are we gonna get them back into the museum?
l don't know.
We gotta find a way in 1 5 minutes.
-Wait, wait, wait.
-l caught you!
-How was Maxim's?
-Maxim's is not open for lunch.
You lied to me.
l'm going to turn you into a three-headed toad.
Don't do anything you're gonna be sorry for.
l've never seen a three-headed toad before.
Jeannie, l'm sorry l lied to you.
l was desperate.
Are you gonna turn him into a three-headed toad?
Roger, will you stay out of this?
l'm warning you, doctor.
This is the last time.
Jeannie!
There it is, general.
Well, l guess l better be running along.
-You stay right here.
-Right here, sir.
What have you got in the box?
The box, sir?
The box.
Oh, yes.
That shoebox.
Now, l wonder what could be in a shoebox?
Shoes, perhaps?
Stolen shoes, perhaps?
l've waited a long time for this, Major Nelson.
l have no intention of gloating.
l'm simply going to use this as the basis of getting to the bottom of a lot of things that need explaining.
Open the box, major.
Well, l'd really rather not, sir.
l have some kind of personal things in there.
l hate to insist, Tony, but since Dr. Bellows has made this accusation, l'm afraid l'll have to.
Well, really, there's no need to, sir.
See, l can explain what's in it.
l have this friend-- l'll open it myself.
lt's a lobster.
Well, yes, of course it's a lobster, sir.
l love lobster.
Doctor?
Yes, general.
Jeannie.
Hey, hey, what's going on?
What are you doing?
l am leaving, master.
l will not stay in a den of thieves.
A den of thieves?
Look who's talking.
Now, all right, all right.
l'll take you to Maxim's.
And you can keep your slippers on.
Oh, master, l did not care that you did not take me to Maxim's.
lt just hurt me that you lied to me.
l'm sorry.
l didn't mean to hurt you.
Let's forget about the whole thing, all right?
-Do you mean that?
-Yeah, l really do.
All right?
All right.
Why don't you unpack your suitcases now, huh?
Oh, that will not be necessary, master.
The suitcases are empty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That figures.
Hello.
Major Nelson here.
Oh, yes, Dr. Bellows.
You have the museum guard with you there?
And you want me to come over right away.
Well-- lt's a little late, sir-- Yes, sir, l'll be right over.
l've gotta go over to Dr. Bellows' office.
-About my slippers?
-Yeah, yeah.
But don't worry.
l'll work it out.
Well, very well, master.
l will get dressed, and when you come back, we will go out to dinner.
l may be a little delayed.
How long?
l'd rather not think about that.
Tony, you've gotta get out of town.
Bellows has the museum guard in his office now.
Yeah, yeah, l know.
l'm on my way over there right now.
Well, l will go take my shower.
Shower?
You can't go there.
That's impossible.
They'll identify you.
l know.
But if l don't go, Dr. Bellows will send the tank corps after me.
Did you see the expression on his face when he ate that shoebox?
Roger, this time he's got me.
That's too bad.
You put up a good fight.
Thanks.
Oh, don't forget about my uncle.
-Your uncle?
-The insurance business.
Jeannie, l'm leaving now.
l'll be back as soon as l finish with Dr. Bellows.
Can you hear me?
-Where are we going?
-l need your help.
-Come on!
-Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Roger, the keys.
-Give me the keys.
-l got the keys.
Give them to me.
Here's the shoes.
Come on, come on, come on.
-Major.
-Oh, l'm sorry l'm late, sir.
Well, it.
lt doesn't matter.
l don't need you any longer.
-You don't need me any longer?
-No.
The thief broke into the museum again and returned the slippers.
-No.
-Yes.
The criminal mind is an amazing thing, isn't it?
Major, someday not today and perhaps not tomorrow but someday.
Master.
Hello, Jeannie.
Jeannie, you're gonna hate me for this, but l had to do it.
l had to return your slippers.
Now, they're in the museum where they belong.
And l want you to promise me that they'll stay exactly where they are.
Well, if that is what you wish, master.
Believe me, if you knew all the trouble l went through to put those things back, that's exactly what l wish.
Very well, master.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
You sent for me, sir?
Oh, yes, Major Nelson.
I have an assignment for you.
An assignment?
Well, I'm already working on the ballistic- control simulator.
Well, for the next few days, you're going to be working on this.
Well, well, well.
She's a lot prettier than a ballistic-control simulator.
Uh, I don't understand.
Well, I'm going to explain it to you.
The Princess Tarji is the daughter of the sultan of Pakuait.
The United States is very anxious to make a deal for a satellite- tracking station there.
Uh-huh.
The princess is on her way for her first trip to America.
And the sultan has indicated to us that it would please him if we saw to it that she had a good time while she was here.
Naturally, we want to please him.
Uh, do you follow me, major?
Yes, sir.
I think I'm ahead of you, as a matter of fact.
Uh, why me?
Now, that's exactly what I said to General Peterson.
Why you?
But he feels you're the man for the job and General Peterson is not one to be argued with.
Yes, I I know.
However, if you prefer not to show the princess around while she's in Cocoa Beach, I'll be happy to tell General Peterson that.
Oh, no, no, no.
That That won't be necessary, sir.
I'll be very happy to show her around.
How long is she gonna be here?
Oh, uh, three days.
She arrives this afternoon.
Well, that won't give me much time, will it?
Time for what?
Just work, sir.
I can clear it up.
Good.
Uh, here is a dossier on the princess and her family.
It will fill you in with her background.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, major.
Yes?
If anything goes wrong, you couldn't pay me to be in your shoes.
Hi, Jeannie.
Hello, master.
I am ready to go to lunch with you.
Oh, I I don't think I can make lunch this afternoon, Jeannie.
Something very important has come up.
Very well.
I will see you at dinner tonight, then.
I don't think I can make dinner, either.
Uh, there's someone very important arriving in town and I have to show them Well, this person around.
This person?
Jeannie, let's get it out in the open.
Now, this This person I'm gonna show around is a girl.
A very pretty girl.
A princess.
Now, this is official business and I don't want you to get jealous and cause any trouble.
You understand?
Oh, of course, I will not, master.
I understand that you must obey your orders.
Really?
In fact, I will do everything I can to help you.
Oh, if you wish, I will help you entertain her.
Well, that That's wonderful of you, Jeannie.
I can arrange a lovely party.
Really?
Well, that's a marvelous idea.
I can sing for her.
I will dance for her.
I will kill her!
Huh?
What did you say?
I said, I will kill her.
What are you talking about?
Is this not the Princess Tarji of Pakuait?
Yes, yes.
Three thousand years ago, her family insulted my family and since then, we have been blood enemies.
Jeannie, that was Oh, it does not matter.
I have taken an oath to kill her.
Now, Jeannie, you can't kill the princess because of a feud that started 3000 years ago.
Oh, yes, I can.
In my family history it is written that her ancestor cheated my ancestor out of his business and stole his camels and his wives.
Yeah And our families have sworn to destroy each other.
Jeannie, this is not the Hatfields and the McCoys.
Let bygones be bygones.
Oh, I'm sorry, master, but I have no choice.
And if you cared anything for me, you would help me avenge this insult.
I I'm not gonna let you go through with this.
Now, let's see.
What shall I use?
Oh, guns are so noisy.
Oh, terribly.
Poison is good.
No.
Oh, no.
Messy, very messy.
Right.
Then there's the knife or the noose.
Jeannie, I'm You're not really gonna go through with this.
Well, I must go prepare for her, master.
I will be back.
Ye Jeannie!
Oh!
Jeannie!
Oh.
Thank heavens I caught you, sir.
Is anything wrong?
Is anything wrong?
You gotta stop that plane.
Stop what plane?
The one the princess is on.
Uh, she mustn't be allowed to come into the country.
She mustn't be allowed to come into the county.
Yeah, I can't tell you how important it is, sir.
If she comes to Cocoa Beach, it could mean war.
Um, major you've never met the princess, have you?
No, no, no, I haven't.
And And I don't want to.
You've got to keep her away from here, sir.
You wouldn't care to explain why, would you?
It's rather a long story.
Oh, I have plenty of time.
Well, you see, about 3000 years ago, one of her ancestors stole some camels and some wives and We really haven't time to go into this.
Could you just have the plane turned around, please?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
I'll, uh I'll certainly do that.
Thank you.
I knew I could count on you.
Dr. Bellows here.
Tell General Peterson I'm on my way to see him.
What?
That's what Major Nelson said, general.
But why would he say a thing like that?
If I knew why Major Nelson says any of the things he does, I'd be the happiest man alive.
When I asked him to take the princess out, he agreed.
Then he came back five minutes later and begged me not to allow the plane to land.
Are you sure about this, doctor?
I'm positive, sir.
For some unknown reason, Major Nelson is insisting that we keep the princess out of America.
Let's go see him.
Mm.
It's stuck.
Well, I don't know, sergeant.
I don't know anything about typewriters.
Just Just call Maintenance, will you?
Hey, Tony.
Hey, what's this I hear about you escorting a real live princess around town?
A real dead princess.
A real dead princess?
If the princess shows up, Jeannie is gonna kill her.
But why would she want to do a thing like that?
It's too complicated to go into.
I asked Dr. Bellows if he could stop her from coming into the country, but I don't know if he's gonna be able to do it.
I've got to get Jeannie out of the way for the next three days.
Tony, did I ever tell you you lead a very interesting life?
Master, I have decided.
She is going to die by the death of 1000 knives.
Please, Jeannie.
Not before lunch.
Ah, Jeannie, there's been a change in plans.
The princess is not coming.
She's not coming?
No, no, I talked to Dr. Bellows and she's just not coming.
Oh, but I have everything ready for her.
Yeah.
That's a shame.
She has everything ready.
Roger.
Uh, she may be here next year, though.
Oh.
Well, I have waited 3000 years.
I suppose another year will not matter.
That's Uh, Jeannie, would you do me a favor?
Oh, anything, master.
I've been thinking about what you said.
What?
About my not using all your powers.
And you want to start using them now?
Yes, well, I've been wasting your talents.
I'll say.
What would you like, master?
Well, let's go all out.
How about a castle in Bavaria?
Ha, that's a good start.
Castle.
And a villa on the French Riviera.
Yeah.
Villa.
Um, a ski chalet in Bermuda.
A ski chalet in Bermuda Uh-huh.
But there is no snow in Bermuda, master.
There will be when you're through with it, won't there be?
Oh, of course, master.
But it will take a little time.
Uh, oh, how long?
Oh.
A whole day?
How about a yacht?
Yacht.
In the Gobi The Gobi desert.
But there is no water in the Gobi desert, master.
And how long will that take?
Well, at least another day.
That's two days.
Uh, let me see.
A pineapple plantation.
Oh, that is easy.
In Alaska.
Well, I I'm afraid that will take another day, master.
Yeah.
Three days.
How soon could you start?
Oh, right away.
Oh, master, you do not know how long I've waited to do this for you.
Oh.
I will be back in three days.
Take your time.
Ohh!
You know something, Tony.
Hmm?
That's the first time in my life I've ever seen the real you.
What are you talking about, Roge?
What am I talking about?
A yacht in the Gobi desert?
A pineapple plantation in Alaska?
You thought I was greedy when I asked her to furnish my apartment.
You didn't think I wanted those things for myself, did you?
Well, didn't you?
Well, of course not.
That was just to get Jeannie out of the way.
Boy, you had me worried there for a minute.
I thought my buddy had turned into a sensible, materialistic hog.
You know me better than that.
Yeah.
I, uh Boy, that took a load off my mind.
I was just wondering, uh, if you would do me a favor.
Sure, sure.
Anything you want.
Well, I was thinking, since you won't, uh, be wanting those things, if I Roger.
Well, I was just kidding.
Say hello to the princess for me.
Okay.
Excuse me.
General.
Doctor.
Tony, I wanna talk to you.
Well, I wanna talk to you, too, sir.
How soon can you get the princess here?
How soon can I what?
Oh, the sooner she gets here, the better.
The sooner she gets here, the better.
Yes.
Well, the The weather is beautiful and I want to devote the next three days to seeing that she has a wonderful time.
I can't wait till she gets here.
Dr. Bellows.
Yes, sir.
He's done it to me again.
Oh, I'm Tony Nelson.
Ah, you are expected, Major Nelson.
Please, come in.
Thank you.
I am Turhan.
Her Highness' secretary.
How do you do?
Did you have a nice flight?
Yes, thank you.
Your Highness, may I present Major Nelson.
I am a great admirer of yours, major.
Well, I thank you.
Thank you.
I I didn't expect you to be dressed I expected more veils.
You mean this?
We are quite emancipated in my country.
Please.
Thank you.
Well, I'm glad to hear that.
I I feel we are old friends.
Really?
When you were in orbit, I watched you sailing high in the sky over my country.
And when I was asleep and I knew that you were due to appear, I had them wake me up.
Well, I'm very flattered.
And when you walked in space Oh, I admire a man who is not afraid to explore new frontiers.
That is the reason why I was so eager to see Cocoa Beach.
I'll try to see that you don't miss anything, princess.
Tarji.
Tarji.
Cancel all my other appointments, Turhan.
You do not mind, do you?
Oh, no, no.
I'm all yours until midnight Wednesday.
Oh?
And, uh, what happens at midnight Wednesday?
One of us turns into a pumpkin.
Pumpkin?
You Americans!
I'll race you to the end of the pool.
All right.
Oh!
Come on, come on.
I got Let me help you.
Ooh.
Thank you.
How's that?
Oh, great.
It's so lovely out here.
Can we stay here all day?
Sure.
Why not?
Oh, wonderful.
Uh, come on.
Let's get out of here.
Why?
Come on.
Are you coming here often, Tony?
No.
No, I've never been here before.
Oh, I'm glad.
Well, I'm hungry.
Let's see what we have here.
Very nice.
How about a little mood music?
We interrupt this program to bring you a special news bulletin.
A freak rainstorm has hit the Gobi desert.
Streams and lakes are appearing in the sand.
Meteorologists are puzzled.
Tarji, do me a favor?
Of course.
Eat fast.
These past three days have been wonderful, Tony.
I've enjoyed them myself.
I'll hate to go back home.
Mmm.
Yes Now, uh, you must go back home.
What?
Well, your Your Your people will miss you.
I know I certainly would.
Would you?
Of course.
Will you come and visit me in my country, Tony?
Well, it's, uh It's possible.
You never know, do you?
I'll make it certain.
I'll have my father request you from NASA.
Uh, no, no.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You do not want to see me?
Oh, I do, I do, very much.
But, uh, well I'd rather surprise you.
You and my father would like each other.
Yes, I'm sure we would.
He's on television tonight.
Addressing the United Nations.
May we watch him?
Of course.
Oh.
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt the session at the United Nations to bring you this special news bulletin.
The state of Alaska has just been hit by a sudden heat wave.
Temperatures in the snow-capped mountains have reached 110 degrees.
Scientists are investigating atomic fallout as the possible cause.
She's ahead of schedule.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to watch your father some other time.
I'm gonna take you back to your hotel now.
My hotel?
But it's too early.
Believe me, it's later than you think.
It's midnight.
My watch says 8:00.
Oh, well, it's a different time zone.
I'll get your wrap.
I am back, master.
Oh, good, good.
Oh, master, I had such fun.
Oh, you will love your ski chalet in Bermuda.
The whole island is covered with snow.
Covered with snow, huh?
Wait till you see your yacht in the Gobi desert.
Yeah?
Oh, it's 100 feet long.
A hundred-foot-long yacht.
I brought something back for you, master.
Oh.
That is from your own pineapple plantation in Alaska.
Oh.
Did you say my own pineapple plantation?
Oh, well, what is the matter?
Jeannie, I wanted a cotton plantation.
Oh, but I distinctly heard you say pineapple No, really.
I'm allergic to pineapple.
I'd never have said that.
Now you just hop back to the Yukon or wherever it is that you go and  No, uh, really.
Uh, I know I said What is the princess doing here?
Princess?
Wha?
What?
Wha?
You tricked me!
No, now, Jeannie, now, take it easy, please.
Of course you did not want a pineapple plantation, or a ski chalet in Bermuda or a yacht in the Gobi desert.
Well, now, that is not true.
I wanted a yacht in the Gobi desert Ever since I was a little kid, I wanted a yacht All you wanted to do was to get rid of me.
Now, that is not I Why would I wanna get rid of you?
So you could be alone with the princess.
My sworn enemy.
Now, Jeannie, now, really, I I'm not kidding.
Now, don't do anything you're gonna be sorry for.
And I was so proud of doing these things for you.
You have no idea of the trouble I went to.
I Jeannie, I can explain this.
Now, I don't blame you for being angry.
Mmmm.
That is the real you!
I am out working my power to the bone and you are here with that That That Now, would you stop doing that?
Phew.
Wow!
Jeannie, what are you so angry about, anyway, huh?
Have you ever tried to flood the Gobi desert?
No, I must admit, I never have.
Uh, now, I know it must be terribly difficult, but I I really couldn't allow you to harm the princess.
I have sworn an oath to kill her.
Okay, okay.
Just do me one favor, will you?
No, I have done you enough favors for three days.
Let her say goodbye to her adopted father.
Well, I do not see why I should let her say goodbye to anyone, whether Adopted father?
Yes, she was just a little orphan when the sultan took her into the palace.
You mean she's not of the royal blood?
No.
I I guess not.
Well, then I do not have to kill her.
Well, Jeannie, you're wonderful.
Oh, master, why did you not tell me this sooner?
Well, I didn't think of it I didn't think it was important.
Oh, master, and I had such terrible things planned for her.
Yeah.
Oh, I must go and apologize to her.
No, no, that That won't be necessary.
I'll do it for you.
You just hop back to Alaska.
I would feel better if I did it myself.
No.
I I really don't think I don't want you Come back.
I am very happy to meet you.
Who are you?
Oh, this is an old, old friend of mine.
Jeannie, this is Princess Tarji.
How do you do?
Oh, I want to apologize to you.
Now, I told you that wouldn't be necessary.
Now, you better get going.
You got a million things to do.
Apologize?
For what?
You have to get back to your hotel and pack.
You're leaving in the morning.
Remember?
I have been thinking wicked thoughts about you.
If she misses this plane, no telling when she'll get another one.
There's a big storm coming up.
What kind of wicked thoughts?
Oh, boy, what a storm is coming up.
Well, I thought you were a real princess.
No.
I Actually, I didn't mean that.
I did not know you were adopted.
Adopted?
Yes.
Well, Major Nelson explained to me.
It is nothing to be ashamed of.
Major Nelson explained to me how you were a poor orphan taken in by the royal family.
Yeah, well If someone was taken in, it wasn't I. I don't know why you have cast this This slur on my family, Major Nelson.
But I promise you, you will regret it.
Oh!
Jeannie  Jeannie, you know what you've done?
The tracking-station deal with Pakuait's in real trouble.
That is not the only thing that is in trouble, master.
Now, wait a minute.
If you think you're gonna do that again, you're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake.
You're making a mistake!
Tony!
Tony!
Caw.
Over here.
In the cage.
What are you doing in the cage?
Caw, caw!
What do you think I'm doing in the cage?
Boy, you sure make a terrible-looking parrot.
Listen, I haven't I haven't had breakfast yet.
You don't happen to have a cup of coffee around?
Caw!
Will you do something about me?
I'm sorry.
Tony want a cracker?
Boy, you sure have a great sense of humor.
Phew.
I think you looked better the other way.
Jeannie, where ya been?
I have been with the princess.
You killed her.
Oh, of course I have not killed her, master.
Oh, I intended to, but when I went to her hotel room, she was so nice that, well, I decided that our family feud was silly.
Oh!
Oh, thank heavens.
The princess and I have something in common, master.
The Middle East.
Mmm.
You.
Huh?
She's very fond of you.
She said to tell you that she will make sure that the tracking-station deal is signed.
How about that?
Jeannie, I I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, I will think of something.
Think of something for me.
I'd love to see that parrot trick again.
You looked so funny.
The parrot!
With those feathers!
Yeah.
Very funny!
Very funny!
Get me out of this!
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Boy.
Master.
Hello, Jeannie.
What are you doing here?
Well, it is almost midnight.
Oh, really?
ls it that late?
l have your dinner waiting for you at home, master.
l'm afraid l'm gonna have to finish all this paperwork before l can leave.
l won't be able to make dinner at home tonight, Jeannie.
Sorry.
Then l shall bring it here.
Dinner is served!
Well.
Well, this is really something, Jeannie.
You really are marvellous.
This banquet is fit for a king.
Oh, but you are a king, O master.
This is absolutely wonderful.
Oh, l am so glad.
Would you like a roast sheep?
No.
No, not tonight.
l may even have a little difficulty eating this.
An orgy with a harem girl at NASA?
-Yes, sir.
-l don't believe it.
l wouldn't have believed it either, general if l hadn't seen it with my own eyes.
Major Nelson must've smuggled her onto the base somehow.
Why, there was enough food there for 50 people.
General, please.
The other guests are probably arriving now.
lf you woke me up for another one of your wild goose chases-- Sir, l saw this myself.
This time l've caught Major Nelson.
All right.
Let's go.
Would you like some smoked breast of peacock?
All right, l'll give it a try.
Do you think l am a good cook, master?
Delightful, Jeannie.
Absolutely delightful.
And you are not angry that l came here?
No, no.
l'm delighted.
You don't have to worry.
The daytime is dangerous.
Bellows never comes at night.
There's your orgy, sir.
Did you--?
Did you say ''orgy,'' sir?
No, he said ''orgy.
'' Didn't you, doctor?
l'm finished in here, l'll get on to the next office.
Just a moment.
How long have you been in this office?
Oh, about 45 minutes.
And you didn't see a lady in here with a scanty costume?
No, but l'll sure keep my eye open for her.
Maybe it was one of the other offices, sir.
-They all look alike, you know.
-What are you eating there, major?
Oh, this is breast of pea-- Cheese sandwich, sir.
lt's hardly enough for 50 people, is it?
lt was all so vivid!
l saw the girl, l-- l saw the food.
And you'll see me tomorrow morning at 8:00 in my office.
We're gonna talk about waking up generals in the middle of the night.
-Yes, sir.
-l'll say one thing more, doctor.
The next time you think that Major Nelson is guilty of anything wrong you better have it in writing.
-l'll remember that, sir.
-Good night, gentlemen.
-Good night, sir.
-Good night.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, you can come out now.
Jeannie, come on.
l'm not angry at you.
You really are not angry with me, master?
No, of course not.
As a matter of fact l think it's the best thing that ever happened.
l just came from the base and Bellows'll be apologizing to General Peterson for the next six months.
l don't think we'll have to worry about Dr. Bellows anymore.
Oh, that is wonderful.
l am so happy.
You have been terribly nervous lately.
You'd be nervous too if you had a psychiatrist watching your every move Well, now that the danger has passed, just relax.
Relax?
With Dr. Bellows off my back, l feel like l'm floating on a cloud.
-Now.
Now, now, now.
-Comfy, master?
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
You know.
You know, after last night, l really need a nap.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, that's-- That's enough of the rocking, l think.
Oh, this is absolutely marvellous.
lt's-- lt's the only way to rest.
Everybody should be able to do this.
Say, there's a lot of room.
Why don't you come up here with me?
l don't have a ladder.
Well, hello, Dr. Bellows.
What are you doing here?
You're asking me what l'm doing?
The question is, what are you doing, major?
-Well, you see, l can explain.
-Don't say a word.
-Sir-- -Just write.
-Write, '' l, Major Anthony Nelson'' -Yeah, but, sir-- -Write.
-Write.
'' l, Major Anthony Nelson'' Major Anthony Nelson '' do hereby admit that l was seen floating in the air of my living room by Dr. Alfred Bellows.
'' Dr. Alfred Bellows.
-Sir, this is-- -Sign it.
There.
Sorry.
Major Nelson l've waited a long time for this.
But l think l've finally got you.
Yes, sir, this time l think l finally got you.
Oh, you mean the old levitation trick.
The old levitation trick?
Yes, well, l'm an amateur magician.
Well, you didn't think that l could actually float in the air by myself?
You have a very suspicious mind, sir.
That's what General Peterson told me for two hours and 1 5 minutes.
l don't care what anyone says, major.
l saw a harem girl in your office last night and l saw you floating in the air just now.
-Yeah, whoa, yes, but l said-- -l know what you said.
So you're a magician.
We're gonna find out just how good a magician you really are.
And you better be good, major.
You better be very good.
Well-- The thing-- This can all be explained.
Oh, he is up to something bad, master.
Yeah, you're telling me.
Would you like me to turn him into something?
No, no, Jeannie.
l just hope he doesn't turn me into something.
Like, maybe, a civilian.
You mean, Dr. Bellows caught you in the air?
Yeah.
Jeannie couldn't get me down in time.
And before that, he caught you in the office?
Roger, he's driving me crazy.
What do you think you're doing to him?
lt's a question of who cracks first.
l'll tell you who's gonna crack first, l am.
As long as he can't prove anything, there's nothing to worry about.
Yeah, well, l don't know about that.
Dr. Bellows is no idiot.
Dr. Bellows is-- We were just talking about you, sir.
l'll bet you were.
And l was just talking about you.
We're putting on a little show for the personnel at the base Saturday.
A show.
l love shows, sir.
General Peterson thought you might help to entertain.
Me?
Well, l don't really do anything, sir.
-Don't be so modest, major.
-Modest?
Tony?
You're the greatest magician in the whole world.
You can do a little magic act for us, major.
Oh, no-- Well, l just-- l'll tell General Peterson that you've accepted.
Well, goodbye, gentlemen.
Roger-- -Master.
-Yeah?
Be careful, it is a trap.
Why don't you get yourself sent to detached duty somewhere?
lf l'm not careful l'll be detached from the astronaut program.
What makes you think something's up?
Please do not appear in this show, master.
l haven't any choice.
l already told him l was an amateur magician.
You'll have to be a professional magician to get out of this.
l can turn you into a wonderful magician.
No.
No, that's just what l don't want, Jeannie.
Saturday night l'm gonna go up there as an amateur magician and Dr. Bellows won't be able to prove a thing.
Oh, operator, l'd like to place a call to Cincinnati, Ohio.
l want to talk to Nestor the Great.
N-E-S-T-O-R.
That's right.
At the Palace Theatre.
Thank you.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, l want you to notice l have absolutely nothing up my sleeves.
l take an ordinary walking cane which l turn, by the use of magic into a beautiful bunch of flowers.
You're a real amateur's amateur.
They don't make these things the way they used to.
l. That is lovely, master.
There you are, madam.
And now for my next trick l will-- Oh, yes.
For my next trick, with your kind attention l will make this everyday, ordinary-- -Fish bowl?
-Fish bowl.
--fish bowl disappear into thin air before your very eyes.
Bravo!
Jeannie, l haven't done the trick yet.
Oh, sorry.
Abracadabra, kalamazoo!
Jeannie, l would very much like to do my own magic.
Are you sure you're ready for show business?
Now, for my next trick l will need my hat, please.
Sure.
-Thank you.
-Wait a minute.
You're not gonna break an egg in your cap?
Believe it or not, this is the easiest trick in the book.
l will now, with the aid of my magic wand and a little bit of magic turn this egg into scrambled eggs.
Abracadabra, kalamazoo, presto!
And here we have.
That's the funniest thing l ever saw in my life.
-That is lovely.
-Did you see that, Jeannie?
Wait until l tell the guys in the base about this.
You scrambled an egg in my hat.
Oh, my-- Oh, my hat.
Flowers and the silk.
Oh, yeah, the silk.
And the bag, right.
Please, master, let me turn him into a frog.
-No.
-A bat?
Jeannie, Dr. Bellows is only doing his job.
And you are only doing your job, master.
Yeah-- Well, unfortunately, my job does not include floating around in my living room.
Can you not say you had an accident?
Then you would not have to do your magic act.
They'd never believe me.
Really, that's too obvious.
Look, let's face it, l've got to go through with this.
-l want you to promise me something.
-Yes, master.
l want you to promise me that no matter what happens you won't help me with my magic.
Oh, l cannot promise you that, master.
l have seen your magic, and you need all the help you can get.
That's beside the point, Jeannie.
l want you to promise me.
-Oh, but-- -Jeannie.
Very well, master.
l promise l will not help you with your magic.
Thank you.
Aren't you even gonna wish me good luck?
l'll be happy to wish you good luck but l have a terrible feeling it is not going to do you any good.
Jeannie, please.
Thank you.
l'm afraid l don't understand, Dr. Bellows.
-Oh, sit down, Mr. Nestor.
-Thank you.
You mean you brought me all the way here just to watch another magician perform?
Well, this man is not a magician, Mr. Nestor.
He's an impostor.
Well, if you already know that, why do you need me?
Well, l need you to expose him.
You see, there's one trick that he does that l can't explain.
He floats in the air.
-Floats in the air!
-Yes.
He calls it the old levitation trick.
Oh, my dear doctor, that is child's play.
We use a mechanical device for that.
Well, l'm well aware of that.
But there was no mechanical device.
l checked.
No mechanical device?
That's right.
l want you to watch him tonight.
Tell me how he does it.
Don't worry, doctor.
There is not a trick in the world Nestor the Great cannot explain.
You have no idea how l'm counting on that, Mr. Nestor.
Oh, the show is about to begin.
Shall we go?
Here we are.
You've heard about babysitters.
Here's a monkey-sitter.
Go around.
Right around.
Come on, up and in.
Would you like to sit in front where you can get a good view of his act?
lt does not matter where l sit.
l can spot a phoney a mile away.
Tony!
Tony, Nestor the Great is out in the audience.
-Yeah, yeah.
-Yeah.
l just heard him tell Dr. Bellows he can spot a phoney a mile away.
-You gotta get out of here.
-You're on next, major.
Oh, thanks, sarge.
You're really gonna go out there and walk into their trap?
l really don't have any other choice, do l?
-You don't seem worried about it.
-No, l'm not.
-What's up?
-l am.
Or, at least l will be when l get on this little beauty.
What is it?
lt looks like an erector set that got carried away.
Roger, this is what we magicians use to levitate.
You're really gonna float in the air on that?
And when Mr. Nestor examines it, he won't have any choice but to tell Dr. Bellows that it's an everyday, normal magician's trick.
-And you'll be off the hook.
-Right.
You're a genius, Tony.
Come on, quick, buddy.
Come on, turn around.
-Good luck, major.
-Oh, thank you.
-You're on, major.
-Now, you remember what l told you.
l want you to wheel this contraption in back over there in the exact spot l showed you.
When l say the lines: -'' l feel the spirits--'' -'' l feel the spirits lifting me up.
'' -That's when you start the motor.
-Okay.
-Okay.
-l can go out and enjoy the show.
-Right.
-Well, good luck.
Ladies and gentlemen, l'm very pleased to be here tonight.
l have a calling card, somewhere.
Oh, yes.
Right, yes.
Now, of course, no magic act is complete without the.
The magic wand.
And l'm going to produce one.
He is no magician.
Be patient, Mr. Nestor.
l'll be right back.
Ladies and gentlemen.
You're not walking out on Tony's act, are you?
No, major.
You might say that l'm walking in on it.
And now l want you to notice a perfectly normal handkerchief which l will stuff into my fist just to show you that the hand is quicker than the eye.
Sorry.
What's this, sergeant?
This is the gadget that Major Nelson uses to help him float up in the air.
ls it?
Well, you underestimate him.
Major Nelson doesn't need anything to help him float in the air.
Get rid of it.
But he told me to wheel it out in back of the curtain.
And l'm telling you not to.
He's a major and l'm a colonel.
Any questions?
No, sir.
Now l'd like to perform for you a rather spectacular trick l've been working on for some time.
lt's, as we call it in the trade, the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.
lt's rather difficult to do and you must feel that your spirits are lifting you up.
Yeah.
You really have to be in the mood for this.
You must feel that your spirits are lifting you up.
Lifting you up!
Something's gone wrong.
l think he needs the machine, colonel.
-Lifting you up!
-You're wrong, sergeant.
Tonight, he is gonna float without it.
Well-- Excuse me for just one moment, please.
Hey, sergeant, where is my levi--?
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Good evening, Major Nelson.
l told you l wanted my levitation machine behind that curtain.
Major Nelson, l have a signed statement from you saying that you were floating in the air.
There was no levitation device around.
Now, either you're going out on that stage and float in the air without this device or you're coming with me to General Peterson's office -and explain a lot of things.
-Explain a lot of things?
That's right, major.
How you float, why you talk to walls what made you fall in love with Major Healey's safe.
Oh, l have a list of 1 03 separate incidents.
Well-- Now, either you get back out there on that stage and do the old levitation trick or come with me to General Peterson's.
Which is it gonna be?
l'll come with you to General Peterson's office.
Good.
Now, go back out there and say goodnight.
-But, l-- -Major.
Ladies and gentlemen my next trick is going to be to make myself disappear.
l'm sorry l wasn't able to perform the trick l prepared for you, but-- -l told you Tony was in trouble.
-He is supposed to float in the air.
-Jeannie, you gotta help him.
-Oh, but l promised that l would not.
This is an emergency.
lf he doesn't float Bellows'll think something's wrong and Tony'll get in all kinds of trouble.
-Do you really think so?
-l know so.
Jeannie, you gotta help him this time.
l hope you are right.
Well, l hope you all enjoy-- Enjoyed the show tonight.
And if you did, please tell your friends we'll be here next year.
Well, it seems that l-- l'm in the mood after all.
Oh, boy, what a team you two make.
ls he not wonderful?
Mr. Nestor, l want you to come up on the stage -and examine this man.
-l would be delighted.
Hello.
l'm-- l'm Tony Nelson.
He is floating!
What do you mean '' he's floating''?
l don't know what l mean, but what he is doing is impossible.
How could it be impossible?
l mean, after all, l'm doing it.
-General Peterson!
-There's no need to-- -Look, look!
He's doing it!
-He's floating!
That's what l told you, general.
Oh, hello, general.
How are you?
What are you doing up there, Tony?
Well, it's just a-- A magician's trick, sir.
-Mr. Nestor can explain.
-Oh, he is lying.
lt's been a long, long time.
There is no magician in the world who can do what he is doing.
How come he's doing it?
Thank you, Jeannie.
l do not understand this!
So this is your expert witness!
Well, obviously anybody can do it.
-Doctor.
-Yes, sir.
He's done it to me again.
Oh, poor Dr. Bellows.
General Peterson was so angry.
Yeah, l know.
That's really my fault, Jeannie.
We've got to be more careful with that door.
Oh, l was so proud of you.
You are a wonderful magician.
Well-- You're really being too kind.
You know, when l was a kid l used to watch the Great Nestor and he had a wonderful trick.
He used to take a seed and cover it over with a cloth, and a tree would appear in the middle of the stage.
l never found out how he did that.
Oh, that is simple.
Well, hello, good mor-- Sir, hello.
-Good morning, major.
-Well, good morning, sir.
l thought l'd drop these papers off for you.
Thank you.
-This wasn't here yesterday, was it?
-No.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Oh, Jeannie, you can come out now.
Coming, master.
-Good morning, master.
-Good morning.
-l must have overslept.
-Oh, that's all right.
Jeannie, do you remember l asked you--?
To go out to lunch with me this afternoon?
l remember.
Well, l'm afraid l'm not gonna be able to take you to lunch.
You do not like the way l look?
Jeannie, every girl in the world should be sort of lucky to look like that.
-Do you mean that, master?
-Of course l do.
But that's beside the point.
l got a letter from my Aunt Pauline in Denver this morning and some friend of hers, a Miss Gordon is arriving at Cocoa Beach this morning.
She wants me to show her around.
Would you like me to help you, master?
No, l think l can take care of this myself.
Did you hurt yourself?
No, no, no.
Hello.
l'm Tony Nelson.
Who are you?
Oh, you must be Miss Gordon.
-l've been expecting you.
-You have been expecting me?
My aunt wrote me you were coming.
Sorry l didn't hear you come in.
-Would you like some coffee?
-You do not recognize me?
Well, not from Aunt Pauline's description, l don't recognize you.
l was expecting someone more.
More mature.
-But-- But-- -Just call me Tony.
-What's your first name?
-Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Well, l'm certainly glad to meet you, Jeannie.
How do you feel now?
l never felt better in my life.
l owe Aunt Pauline a big favour.
Excuse me, please.
-Don't go away.
-Oh, no.
l will not.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Good morning, Roge.
Boy, you seem awfully happy for a Monday morning.
Yeah, l am.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Well, it happens to me almost every day.
No, l'm serious.
l really think l'm in love.
You, old Two-Feet-on-the-Ground Nelson?
That's hard to believe.
l know.
lt's hard for me to believe too.
My Aunt Pauline in Denver asked me to take out a friend of hers and this friend turns out to be the most beautiful girl -l've ever seen.
-Really?
-Yeah.
l can't wait for you to meet her.
-ls she here?
Hi.
Well, where's the--?
Where's the girl?
Jeannie, this is a very good friend of mine Major Roger Healey.
Jeannie Gordon.
You are in a playful mood, aren't you?
We better be getting over to the base.
Aren't you at least gonna say, '' How do you do?
'' What-- What for?
lt's customary when you meet someone, especially a lady.
-You have to get used to Roger.
-She is used to me.
Hey, what's going on here?
l told you.
My Aunt Pauline asked me to take out Miss Gordon while she's in Cocoa Beach.
-Will you tell me what's going on?
-Major Nelson explained it.
-l'm a friend of his aunt.
-Yeah, Roger-- Could l trouble you for a cup of coffee, please?
Certainly.
You can trouble me for anything you want.
-l must be in the wrong house.
-Major Healey something terrible has happened.
Major Nelson hit his head and now he does not remember me.
You mean he has amnesia?
Wait a minute.
He can't have amnesia.
He remembers me.
l do not understand it.
He thinks l am a complete stranger.
That's it.
His subconscious mind has blocked you out.
Oh, why would it want to do that?
l suppose because it had trouble accepting you.
-You gotta blink him out of it right away.
-l tried.
-What happened?
-He just blinked back at me.
Did you tell him you were the genie he found in the bottle?
-No.
-Well, that's it.
Just tell him and everything will be fine.
l do not think l can do that.
-Well, why not?
-Because he-- He seems to like me the way l am and l would not be surprised if he wanted to marry me.
You can't do that.
-Why not?
-Because l'm not gonna let you.
l'm going out there and tell him the truth.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
-Where's Roger?
-He had to leave.
He's always in a hurry.
-How do you like your coffee?
-Oh, any way that you like it.
Oh, let me do it for you.
A little bit of sugar and a little bit of cream.
How did you know?
Oh, well, l-- l sensed it.
Jeannie, l hope you don't think l'm being fresh or anything but l feel as though l've known you forever.
-l feel the same way.
-Do you?
How long are you planning to stay in Cocoa Beach?
Oh, as long as you want me to.
Then l have a feeling you're gonna be staying here for a long, long time.
Tony?
Major Healey.
Dr. Bellows, have you seen Tony?
He finished the experiment and went home.
l believe he had an engagement.
Did he say he had an engagement or was being engaged?
-What?
-Oh, nothing serious.
-What happened to your fingers?
-Oh, it's just a little frostbite, sir.
Frostbite?
ln July?
-How was the South Pole?
-Great if you don't mind being bitten by a lovesick penguin.
-Where's Tony?
-Major Nelson is upstairs.
-Well, have you told him yet?
-Oh, l could not.
l have never seen him so happy.
Besides, you know l will make him a wonderful wife.
He can't marry a genie!
But he will not know that l am a genie!
Yes, he will, because l'm gonna tell him.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Jeannie!
-Did l hear the door?
-Oh, it was nothing.
Someone made a mistake.
Where would you like to go to dinner tonight?
Why do we not have dinner here?
l can cook for you.
-You mean you can cook too?
-Oh, well, you love my cook-- Well, you will love my cooking.
l can cook all of your favourite dishes.
Oh, how would you know what my favourite dishes are?
Oh, l know many things about you.
You know, l can't get over this feeling that-- That l've known you all my life.
lt seems so natural to be with you.
Oh, l am glad that you feel that way.
-l will go start dinner.
-Okay.
Tony?
Oh, sir, have you seen Tony?
-He just left.
l believe he went home.
-Thank you, sir.
Major what happened to your arm?
Oh, nothing, sir.
l was attacked by a tribe of pygmies.
Pygmies.
ln Cocoa Beach?
You're a marvellous dancer, Jeannie.
Anyone could dance with you.
l could hold you in my arms forever, Jeannie.
Jeannie.
-Do not say it.
-No, l'm gonna say it.
l love you, Jeannie.
l want to marry you.
Oh, but you do not know anything about me.
l know all l need to know about you.
l must tell you what l really am.
No, l know what you really are.
You're the only girl l've ever fallen in love with.
-Are you sure?
-Positive.
Well, then-- Then it would be wrong for me not to marry you -would it not?
-You mean you will?
lf you wish it.
May l have a cup of coffee, please?
You want a cup of coffee at a time like this?
Please.
l guess l do have a few things to learn about you, don't l?
-A few.
-Sure.
Hello.
l'm Francine Gordon.
l think Major Nelson's expecting me.
He was expecting you, but l do not think he's expecting you anymore because he's busy getting ready to be married.
Married?
His aunt didn't tell me.
Oh, well, it was a big surprise to everyone.
l see.
Well, tell him l hope he'll be very happy.
Oh, he will be.
Very happy.
Jeannie.
-Here's your coffee.
-Coffee at a time like this?
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Good morning, Major Healey.
Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
l trust you've recovered from your frostbite.
Yes, sir.
Fine-- And your wounds from the pygmy attack.
-Oh, yes, sir.
-Why are you limping?
Oh, it's nothing, sir.
lt's just a slight touch of the bends, that's all.
The bends?
On dry land?
-Tony.
-Hi.
-Are you alone?
-Yeah.
Where have you been?
l've been looking for you.
Are you kidding?
Where haven't l been?
l've been to the South Pole, the Amazon jungle 20,000 leagues under the sea.
-What are you talking about?
-Ask your friend, Jeannie.
-What's Jeannie got to do with this?
-She's the one that put me there.
-Are you feeling all right?
-Yeah, l guess l'm okay.
Outside of a slight case of the bends.
Oh, boy, are you in trouble.
Trouble?
l haven't got a trouble in the world.
l got great news for you.
What a wonderful girl.
l feel like l've known her forever.
You could have known her for 2000 years.
Roger -we're getting married.
-Mar-- Married?
-l want you to be my best man.
-l'm sorry, l can't.
-Why--?
Why not?
-l'll probably be in orbit by then.
-Listen.
You can't marry Jeannie.
-Why not?
Because she spells her name with a G. She is a genie.
Roger, maybe you better lie down, huh?
There's no point in my lying down.
l'm gonna be taking-- l'm gonna be taking a trip here any minute.
You've gotta listen to me.
Jeannie is a genie.
-You found her on a beach in a bottle.
-l did?
Yeah.
Don't you remember?
The time your capsule went out of orbit and you made the crash landing.
Crash landing.
And when l landed, l-- l-- l-- -l found her in the bottle on the beach?
-That's it!
Since then, she's been doing crazy things to you.
Like an elephant in the bedroom, lions in the living room, floating in the air.
How could l forget something like that?
-See why you can't marry Jeannie?
-Of course, of course-- Astronauts can't go around marrying genies, can they?
Good boy.
You don't know what a relief this is to me.
l didn't think l'd get to you in time.
She kept blinking me, sending me to far-off places.
Roger, l'll have a long talk with her -so she doesn't do that to you again.
-Thanks, Tony.
Look, l've-- l've got all this paperwork to get out.
l've gotta get it to-- To Captain Freed.
-You wait here for me.
-l'll wait here.
Major Healey thinks you're going to marry a genie in a bottle?
That's right, sir.
-And are you?
-Well, of course not.
There's no such thing as a genie.
You've gotta help him.
He's had some kind of a nervous breakdown.
You say he thinks this genie sent him off to the South Pole the Amazon jungles and under the sea?
Yes, yes.
-lt all begins to tie in.
-Tie in with what, sir?
Oh, with Major Healey's peculiar behaviour.
Oh, Major Nelson, l owe you an apology.
-What?
Me, sir?
-Well, l've done you an injustice.
l've been blaming all the peculiar things that have been going on around here on you and all the time it was Major Healey.
-Can you help him, sir?
-Well, l'm certainly gonna try, major.
-Thank you for coming in.
-He's my best friend.
We'll do everything we can.
Thank you.
-Hi, Roge.
-Well, l'm still here.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, so l see.
How you feeling?
Great.
l thought l'd be in Timbuktu by now.
Would you like to go to Timbuktu?
Well, why would l wanna go to Timbuktu?
Oh, l don't know.
You brought it up.
That's right.
-Can l get you something?
-No, l -better be getting back to my office.
-l wouldn't leave yet.
-l have work-- -l'll take care of it.
l have a feeling Dr. Bellows wants you to wait for him here.
Why would Dr. Bellows want me to wait for him here?
Roger, you're not a well man.
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Dr. Bellows what l told you, did you?
l did it for your own good.
You need help.
l need help?
l need-- l need-- You know what you've just done?
You just got yourself thrown out of the space program -and me along with you.
-Don't get excited.
Oh, why get excited?
You just tossed my whole life away.
-How could you do this to me?
Me?
-l did it for your own good.
You don't really believe there's a genie in a bottle?
Look who's asking.
lt's your genie.
My genie?
Roger, my Jeannie is a wonderful, lovely girl.
Yeah, if you don't mind getting bitten by penguins.
Roger, you're in terrible shape.
You've got to pull yourself together.
Thank heavens you're here, doctor.
l don't think we got a moment to lose.
Major Nelson tells me that you think he's getting married.
Did he say that, sir?
To a genie who lives in a bottle.
ls that true?
l'd rather not answer that, sir on the grounds it might incriminate me and some friends of mine.
You've gotta tell him everything.
Major Healey, this isn't a legal hearing, yet.
lt's just a preliminary psychiatric examination.
Do you think that Major Nelson is going to marry a genie?
Sir, l'd rather not answer that.
He's only trying to help you.
Now answer his questions.
Okay.
Okay.
But you're gonna be in for a big surprise.
l'm waiting, Major Healey.
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir, what?
Yes, sir, Major Nelson is going to marry a genie in the bottle.
And it serves him right!
l told him not to marry a genie, but he wouldn't listen.
What will it look like, you married to a genie?
-Don't get excited.
Just-- -Oh, boy.
Don't get excited.
Yeah.
-l'll handle it now, major.
-You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be just fine.
What a best friend l picked for my best friend.
Now just lie down there on the couch.
-Lie down?
-Right here.
That's it.
Here we go.
Yeah.
Here we go.
l want you to breathe deeply.
l'll be right back.
Breathe deeply.
General Peterson.
-Yes, doctor?
-This is it.
-This is what?
-When l tell you what's happened.
Doctor, is this about Major Nelson again?
Yes, sir, and Major Healey.
Then let me warn you before you open your mouth.
lf you're wrong again, you're in trouble.
Now, what did you want to tell me?
Could you wait just one moment, sir?
Major Healey, l wanna be very sure.
You did say that Major Nelson is going to marry a genie in a bottle?
-Yes, sir.
-That's all l want to know.
Breathe deeply.
Major Nelson is marrying a genie in a bottle?
Oh, of course he's not, general.
We know there's no such thing, but Major Healey doesn't know it.
-He really believes it.
-Why, he can't believe it.
There's no doubt about it.
He admitted it.
This time l think we've gotten to the bottom of everything.
Let's go see Major Healey.
He's gone.
Oh, but don't worry, general.
We'll catch him at the wedding.
Yes, thank you, Judge Harris.
l certainly appreciate it.
No, no, we'll just have a simple wedding.
Just a moment.
Unless you'd like a more elaborate ceremony.
Oh, no, no.
A simple ceremony will be just fine.
Okay.
A simple ceremony it is.
Yes.
We'll be there in about an hour.
Right.
Thank you.
Well, that's it.
Oh, Jeannie, l have to get you a ring.
What kind would you like?
What's the matter, Jeannie?
l wish l could be sure that l'm doing the right thing.
-Well, you love me, don't you?
-Oh, you do not know how much.
And l love you.
So of course you're doing the right thing.
-Could l have a cup of coffee?
--cup of coffee?
-Now?
-Please.
Sure.
Sure.
Major.
-What are you doing, Major Healey?
-l was just waving to a friend.
-Let's go inside.
-Well, l better be running along.
lnside, major.
Well, l should be really running along now.
l want you to tell General Peterson about the genie that Major Nelson is going to marry.
Did you really say that, major?
General Peterson, l love being an astronaut.
Major Nelson is not marrying any genie in any bottle.
-Well, doctor?
-Don't worry, general.
This time l have a witness.
Major Nelson will tell you what Major Healey said.
Where is he?
He said something about a flight to Alaska.
Sorry to interrupt your wedding day, major.
l'm sorry.
My wedding day?
What are you talking about?
l want you to tell General Peterson what you told me.
-About what, sir?
-Did Major Healey say you were -going to marry a genie in a bottle?
-l hope not.
Did you say that, Roger?
-Well, l-- -Of course he said it.
You told me so yourself.
You-- You came to my office this morning and told me that he needed help.
Sir, l haven't seen you since yesterday.
You haven't seen him since yesterday?
No, sir.
lt's happening to me again.
l warned you, doctor.
But, general.
Major Healey came in with frostbite.
Then he.
He was attacked by that pygmy tribe, and.
And then he-- He got a case of the bends, and then.
-lsn't that true, Major Healey?
-Well, sir, l-- Never mind.
l'm going to my couch and lie down.
Well, l'm sorry to have bothered you two gentlemen.
-l hope Dr. Bellows will be all right.
-He may be all right now but he won't be when l get through with him.
That was the narrowest escape l ever had in my life.
How can you tell Dr. Bellows about Jeannie?
How could you do that to me?
Me going around?
You're the one who-- -l am ready.
-Ready for what?
To get married.
The judge is waiting.
Married?
We've been through all this before.
l can't marry you, Jeannie.
You're a genie.
-Well, he's his old self again.
-l want his new self.
Forget about that wedding, huh?
Just forget about it.
-You are sure?
-Yeah, positive.
Very well.
-Jeannie!
-Jeannie!
-Jeannie!
-Jeannie!
-Jeannie!
-Jeannie!
