{START OF EPISODE 01}
Quatro horas da manhÃ£?
!
!
Bom dia, Amo.
Bom dia, Jeannie.
NÃ£o quis acordÃ¡-la.
Sabe que sÃ£o quatro horas?
Cedo demais para Cocoa Beach.
Ã um dia muito especial.
- Amo, vocÃª se lembrou.
- Ã difÃ­cil esquecer.
Quer dizer, afinal, estarei em Ã³rbita em algumas horas.
Ã sÃ³ isso que o dia de hoje significa para vocÃª?
Ã bastante.
A menos que os russos estejam escondendo o jogo sou o Ãºnico homem do mundo que entrarÃ¡ em Ã³rbita hoje.
EntÃ£o, esqueceu que dia Ã© hoje.
NÃ£o, claro que nÃ£o.
Como esqueceria?
Feliz aniversÃ¡rio.
Ã seu aniversÃ¡rio?
- NÃ£o, nÃ£o Ã© o seu?
- NÃ£o.
Bem, que dia Ã© hoje?
NÃ£o Ã© importante, Amo.
Vamos esquecer que eu mencionei.
Certo, vamos esquecer.
Se eu significasse alguma coisa para vocÃª, teria se lembrado.
Jeannie, nÃ£o sei pelo que peÃ§o desculpas, mas sinto muito.
O que hÃ¡ de importante hoje?
Nada.
- Hoje Ã© o nosso primeiro aniversÃ¡rio.
- Nosso o quÃª?
Hoje faz um ano que me resgatou da minha garrafa, na praia.
Que tipo de aniversÃ¡rio Ã© esse?
Bem, sinto muito, mas Ã© o Ãºnico que eu tenho.
E vocÃª esqueceu.
Seja razoÃ¡vel, Jeannie.
NÃ£o hÃ¡ homem no mundo que lembre desse tipo de aniversÃ¡rio.
- Oi, Jeannie.
Tony.
- Oi.
Feliz aniversÃ¡rio.
Jeannie Ã Um GÃªnio Percebe que hoje faz um ano que resgatou Jeannie da garrafa?
VÃª?
AtÃ© Major Healey se lembra.
Roge, como se lembrou desse dia?
Jeannie me ligou ontem e me lembrou.
Pensei em um maravilhoso modo de celebrar, Amo.
Por que nÃ£o voltamos Ã  praia onde me achou na garrafa.
Pode abrir a garrafa e me resgatar de novo.
NÃ£o seria romÃ¢ntico?
- Ã a coisa mais louca - Isto estÃ¡ fora de questÃ£o.
O que Ã© mais importante fazer uma viagem boba ou celebrar o nosso aniversÃ¡rio?
Se quiser o meu conselho, nÃ£o responda isso.
Jeannie, quando eu descer, vou levÃ¡-la para jantar iremos ao teatro e essa Ã© a forma como iremos celebrar.
Celebraremos o nosso aniversÃ¡rio na ilha.
NÃ£o, temo que nÃ£o.
Seja uma boa garota, e divirta-se em casa.
Quando eu voltar, ligo para vocÃª.
Adeus e feliz aniversÃ¡rio.
Tchau.
Se tem algo que me deixa nervoso Ã© um gÃªnio bravo.
ADMINISTRAÃÃO NACIONAL DE AERONÃUTICA E ESPAÃO CONTROLE CENTRAL Aqui estÃ¡, doutor.
Obrigado.
Tivemos problemas no sistema elÃ©trico.
Era nas cÃ©lulas de combustÃ­vel.
Checado.
- Como se sente, Tony?
- Bem, bem.
- Gostaria de ir junto.
- Da prÃ³xima vez.
- Bem, Major Nelson.
- Senhor.
- Feliz aniversÃ¡rio.
- Disse: "Feliz aniversÃ¡rio"?
Sim, faz um ano que fez sua Ãºltima viagem espacial e pousou naquela ilha do pacÃ­fico.
Lembra-se?
Sim, esse aniversÃ¡rio.
Como esqueceria?
Bem, desta vez espero um vÃ´o perfeito.
- Eu tambÃ©m, senhor.
- Todos os satÃ©lites jÃ¡ relataram e estÃ¡ tudo bem, nÃ£o hÃ¡ nada para se preocupar.
Cuidado Cuidado Cuidado com o nariz.
- E aÃ­, Ken.
Encaixou deste lado?
- Tudo certo.
- Bem!
- Boa sorte Tony.
Contagem regressiva Indicadores e oscilÃ³grafos foram testados.

Afirmativo.

Tenho uma luz aqui.
Saiu do curso.
O que houve?
O estÃ¡gio final deu errado.
NÃ£o poderÃ¡ manter Ã³rbita.
- Temos que trazÃª-lo.
- Decolagem perfeita.
NÃ£o entendo.
Ã o mesmo lugar em que desceu no ano passado.
Agora, o que aconteceu com ele?
Acho que ele deve ter parado para celebrar o aniversÃ¡rio.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Sabe o que fez?
Jeannie, onde estÃ¡ vocÃª?
NÃ£o tenho tempo para brincar.
Jeannie, nÃ£o posso brincar.
Estou muito tocado.
Percebe quanto este gesto seu custarÃ¡ ao governo dos Estados Unidos?
Jeannie!
AÃ­ estÃ¡ vocÃª.
Tem uma nova garrafa, nÃ£o?
Comprou uma garrafa diferente de aniversÃ¡rio?
Saia daÃ­.
- VocÃª nÃ£o Ã© a Jeannie.
- Sou o GÃªnio Azul.
Quer dizer que hÃ¡ mais de um de vocÃªs?
Quer dizer que eu abri a garrafa errada?
Estou preso nessa garrafa hÃ¡ 1.500 anos e suas mÃ£os me libertaram.
Sim, sim, sei.
Passei por isto antes.
VocÃª Ã© grato e posso ter tudo o que quiser no mundo.
Fiz um voto de destruir quem quer que abrisse a garrafa.
Espere, destruir?
Por que me destruiria?
Eu resgatei vocÃª.
Se tivesse me resgatado mil anos atrÃ¡s, eu seria grato.
Mas, nos Ãºltimos 500 anos, fiquei zangado.
Como gostarias de morrer?
De velhice.
Talvez gostasse de alimentar os tubarÃµes.
- Tem algo mais?
- Jogar-te dentro de um vulcÃ£o.
Sim, estÃ¡ ficando quente.
O que mais tem?
Poderia transformar-te em uma pulga e esmagar-te.
Tenho uma surpresinha para vocÃª, amigo.
Feliz aniversÃ¡rio, Amo.
Jeannie, tenho um presentinho de aniversÃ¡rio para vocÃª.
- O GÃªnio Azul do Mal!
- Encontrei-te.
Sabe qual Ã© o seu problema?
VocÃª Ã© hostil.
Sim, hostil.
NÃ£o pensou que eu tivesse um gÃªnio.
- Certo, pegue-o, Jeannie.
- Amo NÃ£o, Amo.
Como quer que eu lhe dÃª aos tubarÃµes?
Jogar-me em um vulcÃ£o em erupÃ§Ã£o?
Se hÃ¡ uma coisa que eu nÃ£o suporto Ã© ameaÃ§a.
- Amo.
- Pegue-o, Jeannie.
Terei prazer em vÃª-lo morrer devagar.
Certo, Jeannie, agora.
NÃ£o posso, Amo.
Ele Ã© o GÃªnio Azul do Mal.
Foi ele que me pÃ´s na garrafa, dois mil anos atrÃ¡s.
Ele Ã© o mais poderoso de todos nÃ³s.
Foi um prazer conhecÃª-lo, senhor.
- Eu te procurei por toda parte.
- Deixe-me em paz.
- VocÃª a ouviu, deixe-a em paz.
- Amo.
Tenho pensado em ti hÃ¡ 1.500 anos.
Tire as mÃ£os dela, estÃ¡ ouvindo.
Amo.
- Por favor, ajude-me, Amo.
- Pode apostar que sim.
Para falar a verdade nÃ£o aceito gentilmente quem me enterra na areia.
Tu voltarÃ¡s comigo.
Estou avisando, amigo, sou esquentado.
Vou me livrar de vocÃª de uma vez por todas.
NÃ£o.
NÃ£o, espere.
Espere.
Se for com vocÃª, vocÃª o poupa?
- VirÃ¡ comigo de boa vontade?
- Sim, se vocÃª o libertar.
- NÃ£o posso deixÃ¡-la fazer isso.
- Se eu nÃ£o fizer, ele o matarÃ¡.
- NÃ£o posso deixar que faÃ§a isto.
- Ã o Ãºnico meio de salvÃ¡-lo.
- O que acontecerÃ¡ com vocÃª?
- NÃ£o se preocupe comigo, Amo.
- Jeannie, vou vÃª-la de novo?
- Temo que nÃ£o.
- Venha.
Vamos partir.
- Espere.
- Ao menos deixe-me dizer adeus a ela.
- Certo, rÃ¡pido.
Jeannie, o que pensa quando eu digo Cocoa?
- Cacau?
- NÃ£o.
- Baunilha?
- NÃ£o.
Praia?
- Agora?
- Sim.
Ei, conseguiu.
Estou tÃ£o feliz.
Feliz aniversÃ¡rio, Amo.
Feliz aniversÃ¡rio, Jeannie.
Cuidado, Amo!
Ei, boa garota, Jeannie.
Sou muito hospitaleiro, mas esta Ã© a minha casa.
Tentou me enganar.
SerÃ¡ punido por isso.
- Por favor, ajude-me, Amo.
- NÃ£o se preocupe, cuido disto.
- Ele me aborreceu pela Ãºltima vez.
- NÃ£o!
NÃ£o!
- NÃ£o!
- Jeannie.
Espere.
Tudo bem, amigo, Ã© isto.
Conseguiu.
NÃ£o queria fazer isto, mas vocÃª me forÃ§ou.
- Terei de destruÃ­-lo.
- VocÃª, me destruir?
Por favor, nÃ£o o deixe mais bravo do que jÃ¡ estÃ¡, Amo.
Ele terÃ¡ que se preocupar em me irritar, Jeannie.
Tenho mais magia em meu dedinho, do que vocÃª no corpo todo.
- Tu nÃ£o tens magia.
- Ah, sim?
Posso comandar um exÃ©rcito do nada.
De fato, Ã© um exÃ©rcito.
Como gostaria que eu lhe jogasse em uma enchente bravia?
Nunca vi esta magia.
Ã um mÃ¡gico maior do que eu.
- Ã brilhante, Amo.
- SÃ³ estou comeÃ§ando, Jeannie.
Fogo.
Amo, nÃ£o queria ferÃ­-lo.
Uma palavra e o meu exÃ©rcito o destruirÃ¡.
Por favor, Amo, nÃ£o queria ferÃ­-lo.
Por favor, mande-os embora.
- Fala sÃ©rio?
- Sim.
De joelhos, patife.
- Mando-os embora se nÃ£o incomodar essa garota de novo.
Sim, Amo, prometo.
Jamais ferirei vocÃªs.
Prometo.
Prometo, Amo.
NÃ£o confiaria, Amo.
NÃ£o se preocupe.
Sabe o que acontecerÃ¡ se se meter comigo.
- Sim, Amo.
- E alÃ©m do mais se algo acontecer com esta garota, vou responsabilizÃ¡-lo.
VocÃª e ninguÃ©m mais.
Mandarei o meu exÃ©rcito Tinha o palpite de que o encontraria aqui.
Como vocÃª pode pensar com a televisÃ£o ligada?
- A magia se foi.
- Meio mundo procura por ele e ele estÃ¡ vendo televisÃ£o.
Quem Ã© o seu amigo?
- Ele desligou.
- NÃ£o sou amigo dele.
- Desligou a televisÃ£o - Agora morrerÃ¡.
Mas, antes, aprenderei o segredo da sua magia.
Como cria exÃ©rcitos do nada?
ExÃ©rcitos do Achou que criasse exÃ©rcitos.
EstÃ¡ brincando?
Ã a TV.
SÃ£o sÃ³ imagens, nÃ£o Ã© real.
- Obrigado, Roge.
- VocÃª nÃ£o tem magia.
Pare de brincar e vÃ¡ para a base.
Eles estÃ£o malucos.
Por favor, nÃ£o o machuque.
Irei com vocÃª.
JÃ¡ me enganou.
Devo me certificar que nÃ£o me enganarÃ¡ de novo.
NÃ£o!
Ã magia verdadeira.
Ela voltarÃ¡ comigo.
Espere.
Quem Ã© brincalhÃ£o?
Roger, Ã© melhor ficar longe dele.
VocÃª pode ser maior que eu, mas sou perito em caratÃª.
Roger, nÃ£o sabe com quem estÃ¡ se metendo.
NÃ£o sabe no que estÃ¡ entrando.
Roger.
Roger.
BrigÃ£o sujo.
Sujo.
Roger.
O que fez com ele?
Roge.
Agora cuidarei de vocÃª.
Certo, vÃ¡ em frente.
Mate-me, mate-me mas nÃ£o toque no tesouro de Nelson.
NÃ£o se preocupe, nÃ£o estou interes Tesouro?
Qual Ã© o tesouro de Nelson?
Poderia cortar a minha lÃ­ngua fora.
EsqueÃ§a.
Mate-me.
Antes, conte-me sobre o tesouro.
Promete nÃ£o falar para ninguÃ©m.
Claro.
Onde estÃ¡ o tesouro?
Que tesouro Ã© esse?
Ah, sim, o tesouro.
O tesouro.
EstÃ¡ bem aqui.
Ã por aqui.
NÃ£o.
Bem aqui.
Onde?
Bem aqui.
VÃª?
Ã como guardamos o tesouro de Nelson.
Espere, isto Ã© pequeno demais.
VocÃª Ã© grande demais.
Jamais entrarÃ¡.
NÃ£o Tenho um meio.
Se for um dos seus truques, vai se arrepender de ter nascido.
Certo, tome, senhor.
Isso deve segurar vocÃª.
Sim.
Jeannie saia.
Amo, o que fez com o GÃªnio Azul?
NÃ£o se preocupe com ele.
Ele Ã© forte, mas nÃ£o Ã© muito inteligente.
Eu o prendi aqui.
- Tony.
Tony.
- Cuide de Roger.
Essas penas coÃ§am.
Onde estÃ¡ ele?
Onde estÃ¡?
Eu o prendi no aspirador de pÃ³.
NÃ£o se preocupe, cuidarei dele.
Vou jogÃ¡-lo no fundo do mar.
- Certo.
- Venha.
Nossa, que pena perder um aspirador de pÃ³ tÃ£o bom.
VocÃª Ã© tÃ£o esperto, Amo.
OuÃ§a, como explicarÃ¡ sua volta para cÃ¡?
- Toda a 7Âª esquadrilha o procura.
- Sim, estÃ¡ certo.
Jeannie me mandarÃ¡ para a ilha e eles me encontrarÃ£o lÃ¡.
Certo, Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Onde Acho que ela voltou para deixar o amigo.
Qual o seu prÃ³ximo passo?
EstÃ¡ certo.
Qual serÃ¡ o meu prÃ³ximo passo?
Milhares de pessoas procuram por mim.
Tem idÃ©ia do quanto durarÃ¡ esta busca?
CustarÃ¡ milhÃµes ao governo dos Estados Unidos.
NÃ£o hÃ¡ outro meio.
Voltarei Ã  base e serei franco com eles.
Ser franco?
NÃ£o pode voltar e contar a verdade.
A NASA se curvarÃ¡ a um astronauta com seu prÃ³prio gÃªnio?
- EsqueÃ§a.
- NÃ£o pode ser evitado.
- Boa sorte, entÃ£o.
- Obrigado.
- E adeus.
- Sim.
ADMINISTRAÃÃO NACIONAL DE AERONÃUTICA E ESPAÃO Major Nelson.
Sim, senhor?
- NÃ£o pode ser vocÃª.
EstÃ¡ lÃ¡ em cima.
- Estava, senhor.
Vi colocarem vocÃª em Ã³rbita.
Sim, senhor, eu sei Toda a frota estÃ¡ lhe procurando lÃ¡ e vocÃª estÃ¡ aqui.
- Posso explicar, senhor.
- VocÃª irÃ¡ explicar.
Mas explicarÃ¡ ao General Peterson.
Espere bem aqui.
Sargento.
Quero que fique de guarda frente a essa porta.
NinguÃ©m entra ou sai.
Entendeu?
Sim, senhor.
- Algum sinal dele?
- Negativo, general.
Pobre Tony.
- Pode cancelar as buscas, general.
- Cancelar?
- Do que estÃ¡ falando?
- Estou falando do Major Nelson.
NÃ£o o encontrarÃ¡ aÃ­, porque ele estÃ¡ na minha sala.
Sabe o que acabou de dizer?
Disse que o Major Anthony Nelson estÃ¡ na minha sala bem agora, sob guarda.
Ele nÃ£o pode estar lÃ¡, estÃ¡ a 16.000 km daqui.
Sei que tivemos diferenÃ§as sobre o Major Nelson no passado mas, agora, nÃ£o hÃ¡ dÃºvidas.
Eu o peguei, general.
E quando ele explicar isto, terÃ¡ que explicar outras coisas.
NÃ£o creio que ele esteja lÃ¡, doutor.
NÃ£o precisarÃ¡ da minha palavra, verÃ¡ por si mesmo.
- Estou lhe avisando, doutor - Ele estÃ¡ sob guarda, general.
Vamos.
VÃª, senhor, tenho um gÃªnio e ela queria celebrar o nosso aniversÃ¡rio.
E sabe como os gÃªnios sÃ£o.
NÃ£o?
HÃ¡ muitas coisas neste mundo que nÃ£o entendemos, senhor e esta Ã© uma delas.
Voltei, Amo.
- Onde esteve, Jeannie?
- Despejando o GÃªnio Azul do Mal no meio do oceano.
- Pode trazÃª-lo de volta?
- Para quÃª?
Porque eu quero que ele me jogue no vulcÃ£o.
Sabe o que acontecerÃ¡ comigo quando o General Peterson vier?
NÃ£o poderei explicar isto nem se eu viver Se eu viver atÃ© a sua idade.
Jeannie, eu deveria estar em Ã³rbita.
Afaste-se, sargento.
Esperei muito tempo por isto, general.
Jeannie, tire-nos daqui.
- Aqui estÃ¡ ele.
- Quem estÃ¡ aqui, doutor?
- Mas ele estava bem aqui.
Sargento.
- Sim, senhor?
- Onde estÃ¡ o Major Nelson?
- Em Ã³rbita, nÃ£o?
AlguÃ©m saiu desta sala, sargento?
NÃ£o, senhor.
E as janelas estÃ£o fechadas por dentro.
Mas ele estava bem aqui.
Eu disse: "Mas nÃ£o pode ser vocÃª".
Ele disse: "Posso explicar, senhor".
Eu disse: "Toda a frota o procura".
Ele disse General, captamos a cÃ¡psula do Major Nelson no nosso campo.
Onde ele estÃ¡?
EstÃ¡ em Ã³rbita, onde deveria estar.
Deve ter havido algo errado com a nossa telemetria.
- Estou pronta, Amo.
- Certo, Jeannie.
Para onde gostaria de ir VocÃª Ã© a coisa mais linda que eu jÃ¡ vi.
Obrigada, Amo.
- Obrigado.
- Gosta do meu novo vestido?
Sim, Jeannie, Ã© lindo.
NÃ£o conseguia decidir se usaria este ou este.
VocÃª nÃ£o tem problemas com o seu guarda-roupas, tem?

Onde gostaria que eu a levasse para jantar?
Jeannie.

{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Cinco, seis, sete, oito nove, dez, onze, doze, treze - O que foi?
- Volte a dormir, Amo.
- Que horas sÃ£o?
- SÃ£o sete horas.
Volte a dormir.
EstÃ¡ muito cansado.
Sete horas!
Jeannie, tenho de me vestir.
Tenho uma reuniÃ£o, dentro de uma hora.
Tem trabalhado demais, Amo.
Quase 24 horas por dia, nas Ãºltimas semanas.
NÃ£o tem outro jeito.
Uma missÃ£o espacial se aproxima.
Mas precisa de tempo para relaxar.
Eu relaxo aos domingos.
Pena que nÃ£o seja domingo todo dia, nÃ£o Ã©?
- Ã uma grande idÃ©ia.
- O quÃª?
- Espere - Pode voltar para a cama.
Hoje Ã© domingo.
Servirei o cafÃ© da manhÃ£ na cama.
NÃ£o.
Hoje Ã© segunda-feira.
O General Peterson e toda a equipe me esperam.
Ã o Roger, ele veio me buscar.
- Desculpe-me, Roge, dormi demais.
- Bom dia.
Puxa, melhor se vestir.
Temos um compromisso em 15 minutos.
Jeannie Ã Um GÃªnio Always On Sunday Roger, vai assim para o trabalho?
Trabalho?
Eu vou jogar golfe.
- Na segunda-feira?
- Cara, vocÃª pirou.
Estamos em plena manhÃ£ de domingo.
Eu disse para ele, Major Healey.
NÃ£o, nada disso.
Ontem foi domingo.
- Jogamos golfe, lembra?
- Isso foi no domingo passado.
Vai jogar golfe ou nÃ£o?
A turma estÃ¡ esperando.
O General Peterson nos aguarda para uma reuniÃ£o.
ReuniÃ£o no domingo?
Desde quando?
EsqueÃ§a.
Quando perguntar por vocÃª, direi que estÃ¡ jogando golfe.
Vou me vestir.
Jeannie, digamos que isso nÃ£o seja o que eu tinha em mente.
Mas, Amo, Ã© domingo.
O sol brilha, as aves cantam.
Um dia perfeito para jogar golfe.
- Jeannie.
- Eu Tudo bem, Amo.
Muito obrigado.
NÃ£o hÃ¡ reuniÃ£o alguma.
Agora, vamos jogar golfe.
Depois eu lhe conto como foi a reuniÃ£o.
- Vejo vocÃª daqui a pouco, Amo.
- Nada disso.
- Sim.
- NÃ£o, nÃ£o nos veremos tÃ£o cedo.
Sim, nos veremos.
- Oi, Eddie.
- Bom dia, Major Nelson.
- Trabalhando aos domingos?
- Domingos?
Acho que vocÃªs, astronautas, nÃ£o tÃªm noÃ§Ã£o de tempo.
Ã.
Ela aprontou.
- Jeannie.
Jeannie.
- EstÃ¡ de volta.
O que quer no cafÃ© da manhÃ£ desse domingo, Amo?
NÃ£o quero nada, porque hoje nÃ£o Ã© domingo.
- Pode parar com isso, mocinha.
- Com o quÃª?
- De fazer o dia virar domingo.
- Vou parar.
- Assim que estiver descansado.
- NÃ£o Ã© um pedido, Ã© uma ordem.
Parece esquecer quem manda por aqui.
Isso nÃ£o pode continuar.
Jeannie, volte aqui.
Onde vocÃª estÃ¡?
Quero que dÃª um jeito nisso agora.
Jeannie, seja razoÃ¡vel.
NÃ£o pode sair por aÃ­ fazendo os dias pararem.
O que acontecerÃ¡ se for sempre domingo?
DescansarÃ¡.
Os maridos passarÃ£o mais tempo com as esposas.
As mÃ£es ficarÃ£o com os filhos.
Os gÃªnios, com os amos.
Ã uma idÃ©ia maravilhosa.
Sim Jeannie, Ã© a pior idÃ©ia que jÃ¡ teve em 2000 anos.
Por que, Amo?
Todos precisam de tempo para relaxar.
Sabe o caos que pode criar?
O que eu sei Ã© que vocÃª trabalha demais e isso nÃ£o faz bem.
- Jeannie.
- Nem adianta discutir, Amo.
Ã para o seu prÃ³prio bem.
Vai ser domingo atÃ© que tenha descansado.
PoderÃ¡ fazer tudo de que gosta.
NÃ£o gosto de nada.
NÃ£o vou deixÃ¡-la fazer isso.
Vou ter de usar de minha autoridade.
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
EstÃ¡ lindo neste modelo, Amo.
- Mesmo?
- Divertiu-se no safÃ¡ri?
- Por que fez isso?
- Pensei que ficaria grato.
Antes de me mandar para algum lugar, faÃ§a-me um favor Avise-me primeiro.
Sempre me disse que gostaria de ir a um safÃ¡ri.
Sim.
Mas nÃ£o na hora do trabalho.
Existe hora para trabalhar e hora para caÃ§ar tigre.
- CaÃ§ou um tigre, Amo?
- NÃ£o.
Na verdade, um tigre quase me caÃ§ou.
Foi este, Amo?
NÃ£o sei.
Tigre Ã© tigre.
Agora que tem um tapete, posso trabalhar?
Posso voltar Ã  segunda-feira?
NÃ£o pode.
- Como nÃ£o posso?
- NÃ£o se divertiu ainda.
Jeannie, devolva a segunda-feira ou a enfio na garrafa e jogo de volta na praia em que a encontrei.
Por favor, divirta-se.
- Boa jogada - Muito obrigado.
- VocÃª nÃ£o Ã© Pancho Segura?
- Sou.
NÃ£o esperava uma dupla.
Nem eu.
Desculpe-me por chegar assim Continue.
Quem Ã© ele?
- Jeannie!
- Como foi o jogo, Amo?
Igual Ã  caÃ§ada do tigre.
Escute, mocinha - Isso Ã© um suÃ©ter para esquiar.
- EsqueÃ§a - Porque eu nÃ£o vou esquiar.
- Mas adora esquiar.
- Sim, nas fÃ©rias.
- EstÃ¡ de fÃ©rias.
- Jeannie, nÃ£o pode parar o tempo.
- Engano seu, Amo.
Eu jÃ¡ parei.
O que pode acontecer se todo dia for domingo?
Seria uma maravilha, Amo.
As crianÃ§as nÃ£o iriam para a escola, ninguÃ©m iria para o trabalho.
Poderia jogar golfe todos os dias e virar o maior jogador do paÃ­s.
NÃ£o haveria paÃ­s para se jogar golfe.
NÃ£o sei como era na antiga BagdÃ¡ mas a economia se constrÃ³i com trabalho.
- Para que trabalhar, Amo?
- Para viver.
E?
Torcer para trabalhar muito e economizar para a aposentadoria.
- E?
- Depois poder parar de trabalhar.
Ãtimo.
Eu encurtei a histÃ³ria.
Seguindo o meu sistema, todos jÃ¡ podem parar de trabalhar.
Espero que as mangas nÃ£o estejam curtas.
- Por quanto tempo serÃ¡ domingo?
- AtÃ© que descanse, Amo.
EstÃ¡ pÃ¡lido, tem olheiras - e suas mÃ£os tremem.
- Todo o meu corpo treme.
- Quando desligarÃ¡ o domingo?
- EstÃ¡ gritando comigo.
Ã o sinal de que estÃ¡ nervoso.
Nervoso?
Estou indo Ã  loucura!
- EstÃ¡ gritando de novo.
- Sim Bem Eu vou terminar em outro lugar.
Bom dia, Major Nelson.
Desculpe-me por atrapalhar o seu domingo mas quebrei o cortador de grama.
Posso usar o seu?
Doutor, temos de conversar.
- Que dia Ã© hoje?
- Domingo.
Ã o que todos pensam.
Hoje Ã© segunda-feira.
Ã verdade que em algumas partes do mundo Em todo lugar.
- Doutor, o tempo parou.
- O tempo parou?
- Sim, senhor.
- Mas o relÃ³gio estÃ¡ funcionando.
- O relÃ³gio funciona, mas o calendÃ¡rio parou.
- O calendÃ¡rio parou?
Todo dia Ã© domingo e se nÃ£o fizermos nada a respeito o mundo serÃ¡ destruÃ­do.
- HÃ¡ quanto tempo Ã© domingo, major?
- Ontem foi domingo.
Hoje Ã© domingo, mas o preocupante Ã© que amanhÃ£ serÃ¡ domingo e assim por diante, a menos que eu descanse.
Sim, precisa descansar.
NÃ£o tenho tempo de caÃ§ar tigres ou jogar tÃªnis com uma missÃ£o a caminho.
Claro.
Agora, apenas deite-se.
O mundo todo estÃ¡ cuidando dos jardins, jogando golfe e pescando.
E quanto Ã s fÃ¡bricas e escritÃ³rios?
Achei que pudesse dar um jeito sozinho, mas preciso de ajuda.
Sim, precisa mesmo.
Mas nÃ£o se preocupe.
Sou o Ãºnico que pode resolver isso.
Relaxando, me livrando dessas olheiras.
- Fique deitado.
Eu volto jÃ¡.
- Obrigado.
Aonde vai?
Dizer Ã s grÃ¡ficas para mudarem o calendÃ¡rio.
Obrigado.
- Dr. Bellows.
- FicarÃ¡ lindo.
O Dr. Bellows acha que enlouqueci.
Devia estar chateado porque gritou com ele.
General Peterson, pode vir aqui?
Ã o Major Nelson de novo.
Ele acha que o calendÃ¡rio parou.
Sim, general.
NÃ£o, nÃ£o tem nada a ver com a teoria da relatividade de Einstein.
Tem a ver com o Major Nelson.
Ele pensa que todo dia Ã© domingo.
AlÃ´?
- Prove.
- NÃ£o.
Serviu direitinho.
Preciso apenas acabar a manga direita.
Jeannie, pare de gracinhas.
Pela Ãºltima vez Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Quando subi as escadas o major Nelson havia desaparecido!
Eu vim sÃ³ pedir o cortador de gramas emprestado!
Que dia Ã© hoje!
Domingo, senhor!
Tem certeza!
Sim, senhor!
Me sinto bem melhor!
Obrigado Major.
Devo ter pego sol demais!
Tem algo errado nessa casa!
O cortador de gramas do toni estÃ¡ na garagem, se quiser!
NÃ£o me atreveria a tocar no cortador de gramas dele!
AlguÃ©m em casa?
Tony?
Tony!
Tony?
AlguÃ©m em casa?
- Oi, Jeannie.
- OlÃ¡, Major Healey.
- Onde estÃ¡ Tony?
- EstÃ¡ esquiando.
- Em Cocoa Beach?
- Na SuÃ­Ã§a.
- Vai a algum lugar?
- Estou partindo.
- Quando volta?
- Eu nÃ£o volto.
Por quÃª?
Mandei o Major Nelson esquiar na maior montanha da SuÃ­Ã§a.
Puxa.
Descobri que ele nÃ£o sabe esquiar.
Tento agradÃ¡-lo, mas sai tudo errado.
Jeannie, ele Ele Ã© louco por vocÃª.
Fale com ele antes de ir.
Ele disse que me devolveria Ã  praia onde me achou.
Bem, jÃ¡ que estÃ¡ trocando de amo tenho um cantinho em casa, e como gosta de se manter ocupada hÃ¡ centenas de coisas que vocÃª Desculpe-me, mas nÃ£o quero outro amo, senÃ£o o Major Nelson.
Diga adeus por mim, por favor?
- Sim, adeus.
- FaÃ§a com que ele descanse - Sim, descansar.
- E que coma direito - Comer direito.
- E dÃª nele um grande beijo meu.
Certo, NÃ£o chore, eu darei o beijo.
- Diga que o amo.
- Pode deixar.
Pode segurar isso um pouco?
LÃ¡ se foi o melhor gÃªnio que jÃ¡ vi na minha vida.
Jeannie.
- Tony, o que faz aqui?
- Moro aqui.
Onde ela estÃ¡?
- Pensei que estivesse na SuÃ­Ã§a.
- Onde ela estÃ¡?
- Jeannie?
- Sim.
- Jeannie.
Bem - Vamos, fale.
- Ela se foi.
- Quando ela voltar - vai ter de me ouvir.
- Acho que ela nÃ£o voltarÃ¡.
- O que quer dizer com "nÃ£o voltarÃ¡"?
- Ela arrumou as coisas e foi embora.
- Ela nunca faria isso.
- Estava muito triste.
- O que ela disse?
- Disse que deveria comer direito e - E que ela o ama.
- Ã?
Mesmo?
Poderia ter me esperado para dizer adeus, nÃ£o?
Acho que foi melhor.
Podemos voltar ao trabalho.
- Deve ter sido melhor assim.
- Sim.
- Vamos voltar Ã  base?
- Para quÃª?
Ã domingo.
- Domingo?
- Qual o problema?
- Sabe o que ela fez?
- O quÃª?
Foi embora e se esqueceu de arrumar o calendÃ¡rio.
- Bom dia, Dr. Bellows.
- Major Healey, o Major Nelson estÃ¡?
EstÃ¡ lÃ¡ atrÃ¡s.
EstÃ¡ um pouco deprimido.
Poderia ajudÃ¡-lo.
- Deprimido?
- Sim, senhor.
NÃ£o quis gritar com vocÃª.
Estava certa.
Completamente certa, tenho trabalhado muito.
Sabe o que sinto por vocÃª.
Gostaria de casar com vocÃª mas nÃ£o posso.
NinguÃ©m entenderia.
Quando nos conhecemos, vocÃª disse que faria tudo por mim.
PeÃ§o que faÃ§a algo agora.
Perdoe-me.
Por favor, diga algo.
Eu nÃ£o a culpo.
Adeus.
- Toca muito bem, Major Nelson.
- Eu nÃ£o toco piano, senhor.
Continue.
NÃ£o queria interromper a conversa.
- Ouviu o que eu disse?
- Sim, Major Nelson mas sei que tem uma de suas explicaÃ§Ãµes maravilhosas.
- NÃ£o, senhor.
- Disse "nÃ£o, senhor"?
Sim.
NÃ£o ligo mais para o que possa me acontecer.
Eu vou explicar tudo.
- Tudo?
- Tudo.
Refere-se ao iate, ao elefante, Ã  Ã¡rvore?
- Tudo.
- Major Nelson nÃ£o sabe o quanto esperei por esse momento.
- Tudo comeÃ§ou - Espere.
Caso nÃ£o se importe, gostaria de uma testemunha.
Agora que vou contar tudo, jÃ¡ me sinto melhor.
Todos vamos nos sentir melhor.
General Peterson, Dr. Bellows.
Poderia vir Ã  casa do Major Nelson?
Ele tem um problema que quer discutir conosco.
- Que tipo de problema?
- Desta vez gostaria que o senhor mesmo ouvisse.
Eu estava a caminho do meu curso de golfe.
Vou dar uma passada aÃ­.
- Tudo comeÃ§ou quando - Por favor.
- Espere o General Peterson chegar.
- Sim, mas Espere atÃ© eu ter uma testemunha.
Por que nÃ£o pÃµe uma Ã¡gua para o cafÃ©?
CafÃ©?
- CafÃ©, claro.
- Ã um bom menino.
- Jeannie!
- Bom dia, Amo!
Jeannie, voltou.
Tentei ficar longe mas nÃ£o consegui, Amo.
E vocÃª disse todas aquelas coisas lindas para mim.
Aquilo foi de coraÃ§Ã£o, Amo?
Cada palavra.
Senti saudades, Jeannie.
Eu tambÃ©m, Amo.
Tentarei nÃ£o interferir mais no seu trabalho.
NÃ£o tem mais de se preocupar.
- NÃ£o tenho mais trabalho.
- Como assim?
- Ã o General Peterson.
Estou frito.
- Ele nÃ£o vai ficar.
- Vou "piscÃ¡-lo" para outro lugar.
- NÃ£o.
- Rimou.
- O quÃª?
"Ele nÃ£o vai ficar.
Vou piscÃ¡-lo para outro lugar".
- Ã isso.
- Quer que eu o "pisque" para longe?
NÃ£o, mas quero que fique por perto.
Posso precisar de ajuda.
- OlÃ¡, General Peterson.
- OlÃ¡, Tony.
Como se sente?
- Ãtimo.
Nunca estive melhor.
- Claro que sim.
Confessar-se faz bem Ã  alma.
- Estamos prontos para ouvir, major.
- Prontos para me ouvir, senhor?
Sem timidez.
Vai se abrir?
Quer ouvir a mÃºsica toda, senhor?
- A mÃºsica toda?
- Eu estava compondo - quando o Dr. Bellows chegou.
- Compondo?
Mas disse Eu disse: "Quando nos conhecemos, falou que faria tudo por mim.
PeÃ§o que faÃ§a algo agora".
Esse Ã© o tÃ­tulo da mÃºsica.
"PeÃ§o que FaÃ§a Algo Agora".
- TambÃ©m trabalhei na melodia.
- Doutor, Ã© isso que JÃ¡ que estou aqui, por que nÃ£o toca?
- Quer que eu toque?
- Sim, no piano.
No piano?
Bem, eu EstÃ¡ bem, sentem-se, por favor.
Agora.
Quando nos conhecemos Disse que faria tudo por mim PeÃ§o que faÃ§a algo agora Diga que me ama, querida Diga que serÃ¡ sempre verdadeira Pare com a mania de "talvez" Diga que me pertence Ã sobre dois jovens que querem se casar e os pais sÃ£o contrÃ¡rios.
SÃ£o como Romeu e Julieta.
- O que acharam?
- Desta vez, estÃ¡ certo.
- Ele tem um problema.
- Obrigado - mas nÃ£o Ã© esse problema - NÃ£o gostou da mÃºsica?
NÃ£o sou um especialista, mas Tony, como compositor Tony, vocÃª Ã© o melhor astronauta do programa.
- Obrigado.
- Mas, general, nÃ£o era esse Tony, se eu fosse vocÃª, desistiria de compor.
- Sim, senhor.
Se Ã© o que acha.
- Foi bom ter me chamado, doutor.
Ã.
- Vou acompanhÃ¡-lo atÃ© a porta.
- Escute, Tony, tudo isso Ele falava com uma garrafa.
Ele disse: "Sabe que eu gostaria de casar com vocÃª, mas nÃ£o posso".
Onde foi que eu errei?
Entre, Roge.
Por que estÃ¡ vestido assim?
Por que estou assim?
Por que vocÃª estÃ¡ assim?
Vamos jogar golfe, lembra?
Na segunda-feira?
General Peterson e toda a equipe nos esperam.
NÃ£o, ontem foi sÃ¡bado.
Hoje Ã© domingo.
DÃ¡ para botar os pÃ©s no chÃ£o?
Ã segunda-feira.
- Jeannie!
- Sim, Amo?
O que fez com o domingo?
Disse que queria mais dias de trabalho na semana entÃ£o, troquei o domingo por duas segundas-feiras.
Na semana passada, tivemos trÃªs domingos.
Gosta das terÃ§as-feiras, Amo?
Acho um dia lindo.
Se quiser, posso providenciar trÃªs terÃ§as
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Amo?
OlÃ¡, sou Harry Huggins.
O Major Nelson estÃ¡?
Sim, mas estÃ¡ ocupado.
Ã a Sra.
Nelson?
NÃ£o ainda, mas estou muito esperanÃ§osa.
O Major Nelson gosta muito de mim.
Sou a sua arrumadeira.
Sim, bem, posso esperar pelo Major Nelson?
- Ah, certamente.
Por favor, entre.
- Obrigado.
O lugar Ã© pequeno, nÃ£o?
- Pequeno?
- Parece uma caixa.
NÃ£o constroem casas como antes.
Que pena.
Falta de gosto.
O Major Nelson tem um gosto maravilhoso.
Ã da renascenÃ§a da cidade de Grand Rapids.
Precisa ver o resto da casa.
Parece um Louis XV.
- Ah, Ã©.
Deve valer uma fortuna.
Ah, sim, dinheiro nÃ£o quer dizer nada para o Major Nelson.
Ã uma cÃ³pia de um Renoir.
NÃ£o Ã© cÃ³pia.
Um Renoir verdadeiro?
- Em Cocoa Beach?
- Claro.
Cuidado com o vaso Ming genuÃ­no do Major Nelson.
Vaso Ming?
Eu lhe disse que o Major Nelson tem um gosto maravilhoso.
- Ele guarda dinheiro em casa?
- Dinheiro?
Aquele cofre estÃ¡ cheio de dinheiro.
Cheio de dinheiro.
Ã como um museu.
VocÃª cuida desta casa sozinha?
Ah, nÃ£o.
O Major Nelson tem muitos criados.
NÃ£o, obrigado.
Os outros estÃ£o de folga hoje.
NÃ£o, obrigado.
Bom dia.
Ah, bom dia, Amo.
- Tem visita.
- Major Nelson.
Sou Harry Huggins.
Da Secretaria da Receita Federal.
Jeannie Ã Um GÃªnio Meu Dono, o Nababo PerdÃ£o, disse Secretaria da Receita Federal?
- Obrigado, Sr. Huggins.
- Ficarei com isto - atÃ© terminarmos a investigaÃ§Ã£o.
- InvestigaÃ§Ã£o?
Major, esta casa Ã© a filial do Louvre em Cocoa Beach.
Desculpe.
NÃ£o entendo.
Sua arrumadeira foi bem gentil em me mostrar o seu tesouro.
Ah, entendo.
Que tesouro vocÃª foi bem gentil em mostrar ao Sr. Huggins?
Ah, vocÃª sabe, Amo o seu Louis XV, seu Renoir, seu Ming Ah, esse tesouro.
Tem certeza de que nÃ£o se esqueceu de nada?
Ah, a estÃ¡tua.
Ã um Michelangelo?
Eu nÃ£o ficaria surpreso.
JÃ¡ acabou?
Fazia tempo que nÃ£o me divertia tanto, Amo.
Gostaria de ver algo mais?
NÃ£o, jÃ¡ vi mais do que o suficiente, obrigado.
Voltarei pela amanhÃ£, com o auditor.
Sr. Huggins, tudo isto nÃ£o Ã© o que parece.
Ah, vocÃª Quando lhe contar a verdade vai dar risada.
Estou louco para saber.
Bem, Jeannie faz estes Chamamos de truques.
- Nada disto Ã© verdadeiro.
- Claro que Ã©, Amo Segure isto um pouco, por favor.
VÃª, o Michelangelo, o Renoir e o Ming e o que mais vÃª aqui, sÃ£o porcarias.
Bem, imagino que esta porcaria daria de Ah, 20 a 30 anos.
E vocÃª pode explicar ao governo porque nada disto apareceu no seu imposto de renda, major.
Ah, e eu nÃ£o tocaria nesse cofre, se fosse vocÃª.
- Cofre?
- Aquele cheio de dinheiro.
Voltarei de manhÃ£ cedo com o auditor.
Mostramos a ele, nÃ£o, Amo?
Acho que ele ficou impressionado.
Por que fez isso?
Porque ele nÃ£o gostou da sua casa.
NÃ£o queria que pensasse que era pobre.
- Ã isso o que eu sou, um pobre amo.
- NÃ£o.
Sim, levanto de amanhÃ£, desÃ§o e o que Um Michelangelo e um Renoir e um Ming.
Tem que se livrar disso.
- Ah, nÃ£o poderia, Amo.
- Por que nÃ£o?
Porque quero que tenha coisas bonitas.
Nunca me deixa fazer nada por vocÃª.
Os outros gÃªnios dÃ£o tesouros a seus amos - palÃ¡cios, seda e - Eu sei, eu sei, mas se eu precisar de tesouro ou de um palÃ¡cio acredite, vocÃª serÃ¡ a primeira a saber.
- Agora, livre-se dessas coisas.
- NÃ£o.
Jeannie, devo pagar imposto sobre isto.
Mas, por quÃª?
Eu os dei para vocÃª.
NÃ£o faz nenhuma diferenÃ§a.
Ainda tenho que pagar imposto.
Quer dizer que ninguÃ©m pode lhe dar presentes?
Sim, isso mesmo.
Diga ao seu governo que isso Ã© ridÃ­culo.
RidÃ­culo!
Ah, e sÃ£o tÃ£o lindos.
- Sim, sei disso.
- SÃ£o Eles sÃ£o vocÃª.
Desfrute deles.
NÃ£o posso custear isso.
Jeannie, pare com isso.
Pare Jeannie, saia daÃ­.
Vamos.
OuÃ§a, mocinha.
Quero tudo isso fora daqui entendeu?
Fora daqui, quando eu chegar em casa.
ADMINISTRAÃÃO NACIONAL DE AERONÃUTICA E ESPAÃO CENTRO DE PESQUISA EntÃ£o, Jeannie lhe deu um Renoir, um Michelangelo e um vaso Ming e estÃ¡ reclamando?
Ah, que ingrato!
Roge, tenho que me livrar dessas coisas.
Tudo bem, tudo bem.
Para que servem os amigos?
Certo, fico com o Renoir, o Michelangelo e o vaso Ming.
VocÃª vai se encrencar.
Encrencar?
Verdade.
Vou me encrencar.
Vou lhe dizer, ficarei com o Renoir e com o Michelangelo.
- NÃ£o.
- E sÃ³ com o Renoir?
- NÃ£o.
- EntÃ£o, vocÃª me paga um cafÃ©?
Isso sim.
Roge, vocÃª nÃ£o entende?
Estou com problemas com a Receita Federal.
Tem um cara na minha cola, e vai levar um auditor lÃ¡ em casa.
Como explicarei toda essa arte?
Ã muito simples.
SÃ³ diga a ele que - Sim, o quÃª?
- Bem, poderia dizer que - Sim, estÃ¡ com problemas.
- NÃ£o estÃ¡ sempre?
- Qual o problema, major?
- Nada, senhor.
- Estamos falando sobre arte.
- Sim, sobre arte.
Tony Ã© muito ligado em arte.
- Sim.
O simulador estÃ¡ pronto.
- Estarei lÃ¡ jÃ¡, jÃ¡, senhor.
CuidarÃ¡ dos controles de solo?
Ã o mÃ­nimo posso fazer pelo grande colecionador da nossa geraÃ§Ã£o.
- Se nÃ£o se importar, major.
- Sim, senhor.
- Acaba isso, sim?
- Ah, sim Vou comeÃ§ar sacudindo-o um pouco.
Comecemos com dez graus.
NÃ£o queremos chacoalhÃ¡-lo muito no inÃ­cio.
FORÃA AÃREA DOS E.U.A - EstÃ¡ bem, Tony?
- Tudo bem aqui.
Pode mandar ver.
Certo, segure firme.
- Vou aumentar a forÃ§a.
- Estou pronto.
- Levante-o a 30 graus.
- Sim, senhor.
Como se sente, major?
Muito bem, senhor.
Bem, estÃ¡ em Ã³tima forma, major.
- Pode se vestir agora.
- Obrigado.
Com licenÃ§a.
SALA DE EXAME Dr. Bellows.
Uma visita para mim?
Quem Ã©?
Huggins?
NÃ£o conheÃ§o nenhum Huggins.
Ah, urgente, hein?
Muito bem.
Estou indo para a minha sala agora.
- Vejo vocÃª mais tarde.
- Sim, senhor.
- Sua camisa.
- Camisa?
Ah, sim.
- Ah, entre.
- Dr. Bellows?
- Sim?
- Harry Huggins.
Sente-se, Sr. Huggins.
Secretaria da Receita Federal.
Secretaria da Se for sobre aquela viagem Ã  Jamaica no ano passado, posso provar que foi assunto governamental.
NÃ£o estou aqui por sua causa, doutor mas certamente tomarei nota disso.
Jamaica.
Estou aqui porque algo peculiar estÃ¡ acontecendo com um dos seus homens na base.
O que o Major Nelson fez agora?
NÃ£o mencionei o nome, como sabe que era Nelson?
VÃª estes relatÃ³rios?
SÃ£o todos sobre o Major Nelson.
- Sobre o que eles sÃ£o?
- NÃ£o saberia por onde comeÃ§ar.
Eis aqui um relatÃ³rio sobre uma mulher que jura que o viu voando sobre Cocoa Beach.
Ele Ã© piloto, nÃ£o?
O que hÃ¡ de estranho nisso?
Ele nÃ£o tinha aviÃ£o.
Um frentista viu o carro do Major Nelson entrando em um drive-in.
Bem, isso nÃ£o parece estranho.
NÃ£o havia ninguÃ©m no carro.
Ah, eis um que lhe interessarÃ¡.
Viram nevar na casa do Major Nelson mas sÃ³ na casa dele, em pleno verÃ£o.
Deve ter sido algum maluco.
Isto foi relatado por mim, Sr. Huggins.
Ah, foi?
Tenho 117 destes.
Temo que tenha que esperar na fila.
O governo nÃ£o espera na fila, doutor.
Vim buscar respostas para algumas questÃµes.
Bem, nÃ£o sei se posso respondÃª-las, Sr. Huggins.
Os arquivos sÃ£o confidenciais.
Sou do governo, lembra-se?
Que coincidÃªncia.
Eu tambÃ©m.
E estou vestindo um uniforme para provar.
O que acharia de ter o seu imposto de renda dos Ãºltimos cinco anos auditado?
O que acharia de ser convocado para o serviÃ§o militar?
Deixe-me colocar de outra forma.
Minha divisÃ£o do governo apreciaria a cooperaÃ§Ã£o da sua divisÃ£o do governo.
O que quer saber?
Diria que o Major Nelson Ã© um homem rico?
Bem, Ã s vezes Ã©, Ã s vezes, nÃ£o.
Algumas semanas atrÃ¡s, ele tinha trÃªs milhÃµes no seu fundo de Natal.
No fundo de Natal?
Quando fomos investigar, tinha desaparecido.
- Acho que encontrei, de novo.
- Onde?
Desculpe, nÃ£o podemos dar essa informaÃ§Ã£o.
Isso representa uma promoÃ§Ã£o para mim.
Inspetor Rigins.
Estive atrÃ¡s dele por um longo tempo.
O seu Major Nelson Ã© o chefe de uma rede internacional de contrabando.
Sr. Huggins, se me dissesse que Major Nelson pode voar como um pÃ¡ssaro que faz macieiras crescerem no meio da sala que fala com aspiradores de pÃ³, nÃ£o discutiria com o senhor.
Mas quando me diz que ele estÃ¡ envolvido com uma gangue internacional de contrabandistas - temo que deva discordar do senhor.
- Doutor ela ganha US$ 950,00 por mÃªs.
Mostre-me um homem que ganha isso que tem um Michelangelo, um Renoir e tem seis empregados, e eu lhe mostrarei um vigarista.
O Major Nelson nÃ£o Ã© vigarista.
Estas coisas sÃ£o reproduÃ§Ãµes, sem dÃºvida.
Se ele reproduziu um cofre cheio de dinheiro eu estou ainda mais ansioso para pÃ´r as mÃ£os nisto.
Isso Ã© falsificaÃ§Ã£o.
Eu o pegarei uma hora ou outra.
Acredite-me, Ã© estranho para mim dizer isto mas estou certo de que o Major Nelson Ã© inocente.
O curador do Museu de Palm Beach estÃ¡ vindo pela manhÃ£.
E se o Major Nelson sumir com as coisas de noite?
- Seria um tolo se nÃ£o o fizesse.
- Acha que ele o farÃ¡?
Claro, doutor.
Ele estÃ¡ em pÃ¢nico.
Neste momento, o pobre diabo estÃ¡ lÃ¡ fora provavelmente tentando arrumar um caminhÃ£o planejando ir atÃ© a casa e carregar o caminhÃ£o com tudo aquilo e descarregÃ¡-lo em algum lugar.
E o que o deterÃ¡?
Eu, Dr. Bellows.
Eu!
Sr. Huggins, pode ser um especialista em assuntos financeiros mas eu sou um especialista no Major Anthony Nelson.
NÃ£o hÃ¡ caminhÃ£o algum.
JÃ¡ guiou um caminhÃ£o antes?
- OlÃ¡.
Ei, podemos pÃ´r isto no caminhÃ£o.
- Ponha o seu lado no chÃ£o.
- NÃ£o posso.
Agora estou conseguindo segurar bem.
Segure-se, entÃ£o.
Coloque no chÃ£o.
VocÃª pediu ajuda.
Boa idÃ©ia.
Podemos usÃ¡-lo.
Ã melhor tirarmos isso daqui, antes de a Receita Federal nos pegar.
- Roger - Quer nos dar uma mÃ£o?
- Este Ã© o Sr. Huggins - Prazer, Sr. Huggins.
Da Secretaria da Receita Federal.
Acho que devo ir embora.
SÃ³ um instante, major.
SÃ³ um instante.
Consideraremos vocÃª um cÃºmplice.
Ouviu o que ele disse?
Um cÃºmplice Isto Ã© uma ordem de arresto, major.
Nada serÃ¡ removido da propriedade atÃ© o meu auditor vir pela manhÃ£.
Tenham um bom dia, senhores.
Por que deixa Jeannie fazer isso com vocÃª?
Jeannie faz estas coisas porque me ama.
Sim, ela ama vocÃª.
Acho que, desta vez, vocÃª estÃ¡ sem saÃ­da.
- NÃ£o necessariamente.
- Por que diz isso?
Vou passar a perna nela.
Vou usar a cabeÃ§a.
- Bem, como farÃ¡ isso?
- Direi, "Jeannie, vocÃª" - OlÃ¡, Amo.
- OlÃ¡, Jeannie.
Gosta?
Ã um Rembrandt.
Ah, Ã© adorÃ¡vel.
Ã o que sempre quis.
O meu prÃ³prio Rembrandt.
NÃ£o vai pedir para que eu o devolva?
NÃ£o.
Nem pensaria nisto.
- Ah, adorÃ¡vel.
- Combina com meu Michelangelo.
EstÃ¡ maluco?
Percebe o que vai acontecer se ele achar isso?
NÃ£o se preocupe com isso.
NÃ£o se preocupe, sÃ³ por isso vou pedir celas separadas.
Jeannie, reÃºna o que puder dos mestres da pintura.
Ah, sim, Amo.
Ah, espere, espere.
Este nÃ£o Ã© o ambiente certo para isto.
Poderia criar uma vila em TÃ¢nger?
Ah, sim, Amo.
- Ah, sim, entendi.
- VocÃª terÃ¡ a sua vez.
Enquanto faz isto, poderia levar as pinturas e tudo aqui para a vila em Tanger.
EstÃ¡ certo, Amo.
O que Jeannie, leve isto com Sr. Huggins, achei que jÃ¡ tivesse ido embora.
Para falar a verdade, nÃ£o agÃ¼entaria me separar dessas coisas lindas.
EntÃ£o decidi passar a noite aqui, com Michelangelo.
Entre, professor.
Como vai.
NÃ£o pode farejar Cellini no ar?
- Major Nelson.
- Como vai, senhor?
Major Healey.
- Professor Preever.
- Cavalheiros.
- Eu atendo.
- NÃ£o, eu atendo.
Ah, vocÃª atende.
Dr. Bellows.
O que faz aqui, senhor?
OlÃ¡, major.
Vim oferecer os meus serviÃ§os.
Ah, quanta gentileza.
VocÃª Ã© muitas coisas, major, muitas coisas.
Mas nÃ£o Ã© um contrabandista internacional.
O senhor vai achar isso muito interessante, professor.
Por exemplo, aqui temos um genuÃ­no vaso Ming.
Quanto diria que isso vale?
Cerca de US$ 1,25.
FEITO NO JAPÃO Feito no JapÃ£o.
Eu sabia.
NÃ£o sei como, mas eu sabia.
Eles tÃªm um Renoir.
De bigode?
Ã a cara da minha tia.
NÃ£o estava lÃ¡ ontem.
Seis dedos?
Ã um tipo de piada?
VocÃª me traz atÃ© aqui e me mostra uma coleÃ§Ã£o de porcaria?
NÃ£o entendo.
E o cofre cheio de dinheiro?
Ã dinheiro Confederado.
Ã dinheiro Confederado?
E o ouro?
Experimente um.
- Chocolate.
- Vou mandar a conta para vocÃª.
- Major - Professor, um minuto.
Mal posso lhe dizer que prazer Ã© vÃª-lo fazendo isso com outra pessoa.
Sobre sua viagem Ã  Jamaica, Dr. Bellows disse que era assunto estritamente governamental?
Por que nÃ£o me conta a verdade toda pelo resto da tarde.
Obrigado, mas nÃ£o quero passar por isso de novo.
- Nem eu.
- Ã sua prÃ³pria culpa, Amo.
- Minha culpa?
- Sim.
Deveria ter me dito que isso meteria vocÃª em encrenca.
Eu nunca teria feito isso.
Eu poderia ter impressionado aquele homem de muitas formas.
Ele nÃ£o tinha que ter entrado na sua casa.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Hello.
Oh, hi, Roge, how are you?
No, no, I'm afraid I can't today.
I promised Jeannie I'd take her on a picnic.
Huh, it's raining?
Well, it can't be raining.
The weatherman forecast sunshine today.
And it's raining.
Yeah, well, Jeannie had her heart set on this.
Yeah, I'll see you I'll see you later.
Master, I was not sure whether you preferred chicken or lamb or beef or veal or goose, so We have them We have them all.
Oh, yes, master.
And a few little extra surprises.
I am ready.
Well, Jeannie, I'm afraid I have a surprise for you too.
I am so excited about our picnic.
Oh, master, you do not know how I have been looking forward to it.
The last picnic I went on was with Omar KhayyÃ¡m.
Oh, no, no kidding, really?
Mm-hm.
Oh, and believe me, master, that was no picnic.
Uh, Jeannie, why don't we have our picnic here in the living room.
Uh, you could blink up a tent and But you said we would go to the beach.
Yes, yes, I know I did, Jeannie, but something's come up.
Or, rather, something's coming down.
It's raining.
Oh!
It's raining.
Don't worry, Jeannie.
First nice day I have off, we'll go on that picnic.
Do you promise?
Yeah, I promise.
Let us go, master.
Well how 'bout that?
That is the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
How do you change the weather like that?
Oh, it is simple.
I think hot.
You think hot.
You  It would be great if we could control the weather.
Oh, well, that is easy, master, but would you not get tired of sunshine all the time?
Yeah, I suppose I would.
It used to get pretty cold up in Wisconsin where I was.
Oh, do you enjoy the cold weather?
Yeah, yeah.
I must say, some of the happiest days of my life were spent in the snow and the The cold in Wisconsin.
Like that, master?
Huh?
Hey, that's wonderful, Jeannie.
That's, uh Doctor Bellows!
Hello, sir.
Major Nelson.
I don't know quite how to tell you this, but it's snowing on your house.
Oh, yes, I see.
Uh Well, it's probably one of those freak summer storms we're having.
I could make myself understand why it might snow in, uh, Florida in July.
Yes, well, it's the high pressure But I can't make myself understand why it's only snowing on your house, Major Nelson.
The sun is shining on the other houses.
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, now, it's, uh Well, it's just stopped snowing, sir.
Uh, please come in.
Let me, uh I'm, uh, dying to hear your explanation of this, major.
So am I, sir.
So am I. I'm I'm working on some top-secret experiments.
Well, it's strange that I wasn't advised of it.
Well, I didn't know about it myself until a few minutes ago.
Please, sit down.
That is, I didn't know it would work until a few minutes ago.
It's a very simple procedure of, uh, seeding the silver iodide particles in a low pressure barometrics strata with inverse isobars.
Yes.
Um I, um I would like you to show this to General Peterson.
Well, I'm afraid I can't, sir.
And why not?
Well, it's not, uh, completed yet.
You understand.
Understand?
Oh, Major Nelson, I haven't understood anything since you arrived at this base, but I will.
I am dedicating myself to understanding you.
Uh, do you understand?
What'd you say?
Nothing.
Major Nelson.
Yes?
If you think that this is any laughing matter, you're very much mistaken.
Yeah, but, sir, I-I   I am not cracking up.
I am not cracking up.
I am not cracking up.
You were caught in a snowstorm at Tony Nelson's house?
Yes, General Peterson.
In Florida?
In July?
That's exactly what I said, sir.
But I tell you it was snowing.
I was there.
Now, what are you gonna do about it, general?
I'm gonna give you the rest of the month off, doctor.
I want you to go away.
Away?
I don't want to go away.
I just want you to ask Major Nelson why it was snowing on his house this morning.
All right, doctor, come on.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Roge.
Hey, I hear you had a little, uh, snowstorm over your place this morning.
Oh, where'd you hear that?
That from?
Well, Dr. Bellows has been telling everybody on the base.
Why, he's carrying on like a madman.
You better be careful.
Major Healey is right, master.
I would not want to see you in trouble.
I'm not the one that's getting me into trouble.
You're the one that's getting me into trouble, Jeannie.
But you asked for snow.
No, no, I didn't.
All I said was Oh.
Oh, hello, general.
Well, I guess I better be running along.
Stay right where you are, Major Healey.
Uh, can I talk to you for a minute, Tony?
Oh, yes, of course.
Oh, I didn't realize you had company.
Neither did I. This is Mr  Ali Habeeb.
Uh, Mr. Habeeb is a A rug salesman.
A weather expert.
Uh, he doesn't look it, but she, uh He's really quite marvelous.
Well, what equipment do you use?
Mm, mostly toads.
They're the best.
When a toad croaks seven times in the swamp, when the moon is full, there is going to be a storm.
Can you make it rain or snow?
Rain, snow, thunder, you name it.
Uh, of course I cannot make it rain or snow.
What do you think I am?
A genie?
It's certainly nice seeing you, sir.
I-I hope you'll drop Right, thank you.
Thank you.
You've been most kind.
Tony, do you have any way of changing the weather?
I mean, can you make it snow?
No, sir.
I can't even make it smog.
That's what I thought.
Doctor.
I know when I've been snowed on, general, and I was snowed on this morning.
And you did it.
He snowed on me.
Admit it.
If you say so, sir.
I snowed on him.
Did you hear that?
Yes, I heard it, and, doctor, I think you better come along with me and try not to excite yourself.
I am not excited.
I tell you, it was snowing.
And it was only snowing on Major Nelson's house.
All the other houses were bathed in sunshine.
It was the strangest thing I've ever seen.
All the houses bathed in sunshine and the snow falling on Major Nelson's   Roge!
Roge!
They gone yet?
Oh.
I tell you.
You know, I'm gonna have to get rid of Jeannie for a while, or I'm gonna have a nervous breakdown.
Why don't you ask her to go away for a while.
I've tried.
Oh, I've tried.
I've tried everything.
I guess you're stuck then, huh?
Yeah, I guess so.
I've tried everything except I've tried everything except psychology.
Wait a minute.
I know exactly how I'll get her to leave.
How?
What does she love most in the world next to me?
Me.
No, no, her family.
Are you ready for our picnic, master?
Huh?
Oh, in just a minute, Jeannie.
Roger was just telling me about his family, weren't you, Roge?
Aw.
Oh, yeah, family.
About how your mother and your father and how you haven't seen 'em in a year and you miss them.
Haven't seen my mother and father in a year, and I miss 'em.
Well, I have not seen my mother and father in, oh,  Well, I would rather not say.
It must be hard on 'em, Jeannie, not seeing you.
Oh, yes.
We've always been a very close family.
Oh, I would love to see them.
Oh, I get it.
Bet you're gonna trick her into Too bad you can't visit 'em, at least for a little while.
I'm sure they'd enjoy it.
Mm, so would I. And my little baby sister.
Your little baby sis No kidding.
She must be grown by now.
Mm.
I suppose so.
Master.
Would, uh?
Would you mind?
If I went back for a visit with my family?
You're still the old master.
How long would you be gone, Jeannie?
Oh, a A week.
A week?
Well, that's not very long.
Why don't you take two or maybe even three.
Oh, you are the most wonderful, marvelous master in the whole world!
Shh, look out.
Ahem.
Come in.
Uh, excuse me, major.
Sir.
I'm Sergeant Ben Roberts.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Oh, sure, sure.
Come on in.
Well, I gotta be running along anyway.
Mother and father, oh, clever, oh.
Uh, what's on your mind?
You like a cup of coffee?
That would be nice.
Uh, I'm afraid this might sound a little bit foolish, and I wouldn't even bother'd ya No, no, no, go ahead, tell me what's on your mind.
Well, I was in Dr. Bellows' office this morning, I heard him tell me that you could control the weather.
Sorry.
Uh, well, now, you oughta know that nobody can control the weather.
That's what I thought, and I'd of forgotten about it right then and there, except that, uh, he was so positive about it.
Yeah, well, I think maybe you You misunderstood him.
Anything else on your mind?
Oh, no, sir.
I'm sorry again to bother you.
But major, I hope you'll excuse me.
Oh, yeah, that's all right.
It was just the only way I could think of to save my brother.
Uh, to save your brother?
Well, yes, sir.
Uh, my brother and my sister-in-law, they got this here farm in Four Corners, Alabama Yeah?
It ain't much, but it's all they got in the world.
Anyway, I got this letter from my brother Yeah?
Yesterday.
Saying as to how they're gonna lose that farm.
You see, there's been a terrible drought down there all year, not a drop of water.
All his crops drying up and blowing away.
So when I heard Dr. Bellows talk about you, I, uh Excuse me again for bothering you, sir.
Oh, that's all right, sergeant.
Oh, here, here.
This is Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, that's too bad.
Well He was such a nice man.
Oh, yes, yes, I know.
And his brother is going to lose his farm if we do not do something.
Well, Jeannie, there's not anything we can about it.
There's nothing we can do without getting into an enormous amount of trouble.
Now, you just You just go and visit your mother and father and be happy and have a wonderful time.
Hm?
Oh, I will.
Good.
Uh, what was?
What was that for?
You will see, master.
Bye-bye.
Yeah Uh, Jeannie.
Hey, Tony!
How's it goin'?
Great, great.
Hey, you're looking awful chipper this morning.
Ah, I never felt better.
I'll buy you a cup of coffee.
Hey, you know, they got a new chick that just moved in next door to our office  Kidding.
I've gotta talk to you about the flight I've never seen you happier.
I've never been happier.
You want some coffee?
I'd love one.
You haven't been this happy in a long time.
I had a good night's sleep last night, Roger.
I woke up refreshed, relaxed.
Look at that hand, steady as a rock, huh?
Say, when's Jeannie coming back?
Sorry, I Well, I-I don't know.
I think she'll be back in a week or so.
Oh, you heard from her, huh?
No, not a word.
Oh.
Morning, Major Nelson!
Oh, hello, sergeant.
Morning, sir.
Uh-oh.
Hey, corn.
Oh, thank you.
That's wild, where'd you get this?
That's the finest corn in Alabama, sir.
Thank you.
Uh, no, you hang onto that, sir.
Yes, of course.
Well, who's this for?
Uh, it's for you, sir.
For me?
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, don't thank me.
It's from my brother.
He and his family just wanted you to know how grateful they are.
How grateful they are?
What did you do?
Yeah, that's a good question.
What did I do?
Oh, you don't have to pretend with me, sir.
It started rainin' an hour after I talked to you.
Oh, that's what that blink was for.
What blink?
Oh, nothing, it was just Well, you saved Four Corners, sir.
They're all beholden to you.
Well, you probably even be hearing from them.
Well, sergeant, really I had nothing to do with it.
Honestly, I Oh, yes, sir.
I understand.
This is just between us.
Thanks again, major.
What's this all about anyway?
I knew I couldn't trust that girl.
I knew it, I knew it, just as well as I am standing here.
Roger, that man has a brother.
Uh, his brother's farm is drying up and blowing away, and Jeannie made it rain on it.
Well, that's great.
She saved the poor guy's farm, didn't she?
And you're not in any trouble.
You're right.
You're absolutely right.
You know what that proves?
What?
It proves that Jeannie can use her power and not get me into trouble.
Yes?
Excuse me, Major Nelson.
I have a delivery for you.
Bring it in, men.
All right, what is it?
Well, there's a lot more, sir.
It's from Four Corners, Alabama.
Sign here, major.
Yeah, thank you.
Thank you, sir.
Well, how 'bout this.
It's very nice, I must say.
Jeannie!
Jean It's good to see you, Dr. Bellows.
Is it?
Yes.
Good evening, Major Healey.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
No, thank you.
I can only stay a moment.
Forgive me for intruding like this.
Oh, it's perfectly all right, sir.
What can I do for you?
Oh, you could do a lot for me, major.
And one of these days you will.
I had a very unpleasant afternoon with General Peterson.
He can really be a bear, can't he, sir?
He thinks I'm out to get you, Major Nelson.
Oh.
And are you, sir?
No.
I don't want to get you, I just want to understand you.
Some men dedicate their lives to science, some men dedicate their lives to politics.
I am dedicating my life to understanding you.
Well, it is really very simple, sir.
Don't bother, major.
You see, I've been making a mistake.
I've never been able to pin you down, but in the future, I will.
I will.
Well, that's all I came to say.
Excuse me.
Awfully friendly of you to do that, sir.
I don't know how deeply you're involved in this, Major Healey, but I warn you: Be careful.
Be very careful.
Good night, gentlemen.
Good night, sir.
Do me a favor, will you, Tony?
Huh?
What?
Snow on him.
Major Nelson.
Huh, yes?
Uh, excuse me, major, but this is really urgent.
What is it?
It's about Four Corners, sir, or what's left of it.
Yes?
Now, I know I asked you to make it rain down there, and I certainly appreciate your help, but, major, this is Oh Well, my brother said the streets turned into rivers.
His farm is 3 feet under water.
The barn floated away this morning.
The barn floated away?
You gotta stop that rain, sir.
Sergeant, I'm doing the best I can One of the tools I use is out of town at the moment, and We'll discuss this at a At a later date.
Just a moment, sergeant.
We'll discuss it right now.
It's really nothing that would interest you, sir.
Interest me?
Why, it fascinates me, major.
Uh, from what I just heard, I gather that Sergeant Roberts' brother has a farm.
He asked you to make some rain, you did, and now that you've caused a flood, he's asked you to stop it.
Well, that's the gist Would you say that was an accurate summation, sergeant?
Well, uh Yes, sir.
I guess I would.
Well, that's fine.
That's just what I wanted to hear.
I'll see you in my office in 10 minutes.
Uh, yes, sir.
Do you remember I mentioned pinning you down, major?
Mm, well, um, that's what I had in mind.
A live witness.
I'll see you in my office in 10 minutes.
I am back, master.
Oh, yes, I see.
Did you think about me?
You might say that.
Oh, I missed you, master.
I missed you too.
My father made you this camel pouch, and my mother baked you this cake, and my sister knitted you this sweater.
Oh, master, you were right.
She has grown up.
That's very kind of them, Jeannie.
You can thank them for me when you see them this afternoon.
Hm?
This afternoon?
Oh, well, I am not going back.
Well, you might as well.
Now, I have a feeling I'm not gonna be around for the next couple of years.
Has something happened, master?
Jeannie, why didn't you stop the rain when you left?
Rain?
Oh, Four Corners.
I left the water running.
There's nothing left of the place.
It's a lake.
And General Peterson's gonna blame me.
Oh, well, it is not your fault.
I will tell him that he can Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, master.
Is there anything I can do?
It looks like Dr. Bellows has finally caught me, and this time, he's got A witness.
You're saying that Tony Nelson rained on a town called Four Corners?
He not only rained on it, general, he flooded it out.
Doctor, I'm warning you, this is the last time General, I've got him right where I want him.
They're meeting us in my office.
Boy, when you make it rain, you sure don't fool around, do ya?
I'll try to figure out some way to help your brother and his family.
I'd sure appreciate that.
First, I've got to figure out a way to help myself.
Now, Major Nelson I'll handle this.
Tony, Dr. Bellows is under the impression that you can control the weather.
Can you?
No, sir, I can't.
Uh, Sergeant Roberts I said I'd handle this.
Yes, general.
Sergeant Roberts, do you have any proof that Major Nelson can make it rain or snow?
Well, I haven't any proof, no, sir.
But it sure did come down cats and dogs down in Alabama.
And it was Major Nelson?
Doctor!
That's all, sergeant.
Yes, sir.
Can you make it rain or snow?
No, general.
Yes, you can.
Uh, make it snow.
Dr. Bellows, honestly Try.
Snow.
Thank you, Tony.
Doctor.
I'm sorry about all this, sir.
I'm I'm sure it was all a coincidence.
Snow.
Oh, hello, sergeant.
Major Nelson.
Yeah?
My brother just phoned me and nobody understands it, but that lake that used to be his farm Yes, what's the matter now?
Well, it's filled with the biggest trout you ever saw.
Trout?
And bass and catfish!
It's a fisherman's paradise.
Well, my brother and all his friends is rentin' out cabins to tourists and gettin' rich.
Well, that's wonderful.
I just wanted you to know, sir.
Sometimes, I sure like to hear how you do that, major.
Uh, wait right there, sir.
I got a little surprise for you.
Okay.
Oh.
Jeannie, that was a brilliant idea.
Oh, well, if it makes you happy, master, it makes me happy.
Why do we not go fishing there sometime?
No, no, I'd rather not.
But why?
Oh, well, frankly, I just don't care for fish much.
Oh.
Look out.
Oh.
Just a little token of my brother's appreciation.
Bring it in, boys.
Got a whole truckload outside.
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Uh, I-I-I This is not exactly what I had in mind.
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Master.
Oh It is almost 3:00 in the morning.
You must get some sleep.
Well, I have to finish these reports, Jeannie.
Oh, very well then.
I will stay here and keep you company.
Oh, look, master.
There is a new movie about Cleopatra opening at the Rialto tomorrow.
May we go?
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeannie.
I'm getting ready for an Apollo Earth Orbit flight, and I'm afraid I can't take you.
Why don't you go alone, hm?
Oh, no, master.
I will wait until you are free.
Hm.
I love stories about kings and queens.
They are so exciting.
Mm Yes, sure.
I wish you would go to bed.
No, it's all right, I'm just gonna I'm just gonna Just gonna rest my eyes here for a minute.
Oh  Aw    Hi, Doug.
Mike.
Roge.
Hi, how you doing today?
There you are.
Well, it'll never get off the ground.
Hiya, Roge.
You take your physical?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
How'd you do?
Great, great.
Say, uh, Dr. Bellows wants to see you.
Yeah?
What for?
I don't know.
He just said he wanted you to drop by his office.
Did you take your examination yesterday?
Yeah.
How'd you make out?
Oh, all right, I guess.
Well, all I know is, he wants you to drop by.
I guess I better get cleaned up, huh?
Yeah.
Come in.
Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Good morning, major.
Nothing like isometric exercises for keeping up body tone.
Oh, yes, of course.
Major Healey said you wanted to see me, sir.
Oh, yes, uh Sit down, Major Nelson.
You were scheduled to go on the Apollo Earth Orbit Mission this week.
Yes, sir.
I've been working on Project Rainbow, and- Did you say?
Did you say "were scheduled"?
I'm afraid you're not gonna be able to go.
But I've been training for six months.
I'm aware of that.
Perhaps you've been overtraining, major.
Well, is there anything wrong with my reflexes Oh, no.
It's not your reflexes.
It's your eyes.
My eyes?
Your right eye, specifically.
Uh, you're suffering from eye strain.
Have you been doing an unusual amount of, uh, reading or paperwork lately?
Well, uh, just the usual reports regarding the mission, but I'm sure any eye strain is just temporary.
I'm sure it is, major, but, uh Meanwhile, you're grounded.
Sir, you can't ground me, I'm I'm I'm sorry, major.
I understand your disappointment, but as chief medical officer, it's my responsibility to evaluate the fitness of all personnel.
You failed the eye test.
However, I'm gonna give you another eye examination in the morning, so that we can determine the best course of treatment.
I see, well, that's That's very kind.
Afterward, um, why don't you take a month off and, uh, go fishing somewhere, hm?
Well, thank you, sir.
I hope you don't mind if I appeal this to General Peterson.
Mm, no.
And I've never felt better in my life, general.
Now, Dr. Bellows will tell you that with the exception of this slight eye strain in my right eye, I'm in perfect health.
Yesterday, I passed my physical.
I checked out 100 percent.
I don't believe there's anybody on the base that knows more about Project Rainbow than I do.
And, well, after all, we're not gonna be reading eye charts up there, are we?
So if you would give me the green light, I can go ahead with my pref light briefing.
I'm sorry to go over your head on this, Dr. Bellows, but General Peterson understands a little bit more about these kind of things than you do.
Isn't that right, sir?
That's right, Tony.
You're grounded.
It's not fair, Roger.
It's just not fair.
They give me so much paperwork, I can't see straight.
And then when I can't see straight, they They don't let me go up on the mission.
Look, I know it's rough, Tony.
But if they grounded you, it's for your own good.
It'll give you a chance to rest and relax your eyes.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with my eyes.
You know what I missed?
Two lousy, little letters on the bottom of the line.
The way they're carrying on, you'd think I was going blind.
Will you calm down?
How can I calm down when somebody's taking my place?
Here.
Two letters, gee, that That's too bad.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Could you get Dr. Bellows to give you that test again?
He's giving me a check in the morning, but what's the point?
The point is, tomorrow you can pass it.
How?
How?
Jeannie!
Jeannie?
Beverley.
Huh?
Oh, I'm sorry.
No, forget it.
Just forget it.
Now, listen, the last time she tried to help me, I almost got court-martialed.
Yeah No, no, forget it.
The space program and Jeannie just don't mix.
Yeah, but if a genie What's a genie for if she can't help when you're in trouble?
Yeah, well, that's what I used to think, Roger.
But it doesn't work out that way.
Every time she tries to help me, I'm in real trouble.
I mean real trouble.
Now, don't mention this to her, and I mean it.
Yeah, but I mean, promise.
All right.
Well, I still think you're not seeing this too clearly.
Not seeing Not seeing this too clearly.
That's a joke.
Well, I'll I'll see you later.
Hello, Jeannie.
Oh, hello, master.
You're home early.
Yes, yes.
Is something wrong?
No, no, no, everything's fine.
Just, just fine.
Matter of fact, I have a surprise for you.
I'm gonna take you out to dinner tonight, and then I thought we'd go to that That movie you wanted to go to.
The thing about Cleopatra.
Oh, master!
What about your mission?
Oh, they, uh They cancelled that.
Oh, why did they cancel it?
Mm, technical difficulties, you know.
Is that all?
Tell me what is wrong and I will take care of it.
Uh, no, no, just forget it.
Oh, but master, I know how much this mission means to you.
You've been working on it for months.
We will go to the movies some other time.
No, no, really, really.
I don't need any help, Jeannie.
Uh, we're gonna go to the movies tonight and then you can You can think about what we're gonna do for the next four weeks.
The next four weeks?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, yeah, they've given me a vacation.
Isn't that wonderful?
Major Healey.
Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Oh, I am sorry, Major Healey.
But I came here because I am worried.
You're worried?
You wanna feel a tom-tom?
Something has upset Major Nelson.
Who told you that?
Oh, no one told me, but I was not born yesterday, Major Healey.
I'll say.
He is not going on his mission, and he will not talk about it.
Well, if he's not gonna talk about it, I'm not.
Aw, so there is something wrong?
I didn't say that!
Now, look, you be a nice, little genie and just run on home, and we can talk about this some other time, right?
But Now, any time you want Major Healey, why are they giving Major Nelson four-weeks vacation?
Well, why not?
Please, tell me.
I'm sorry, my lips are sealed.
Major Healey Forget it!
I promised Tony I wouldn't tell you He has bad eyes!
Oh, boy, you certainly know how to scare a guy.
Major Nelson has beautiful eyes.
Yeah, well to you, maybe, but he failed his eye test and he's being grounded.
No wonder he was so unhappy.
Well, why did he not tell me?
Maybe it's because you didn't set him on fire.
He did not wish to worry me.
I don't think that's the reason.
Jeannie, if I were you, I'd just stay out of this.
Oh, well, of course I will not stay out of it, but he is my master.
I love helping him.
Well, I don't think he loves being helped.
And, Jeannie, will you do me a favor?
What?
Don't tell him I told you.
I'm getting too old to make new friends.
Certainly, well, I will say nothing.
Well, uh Thank you, Major Healey.
Drop in any time.
Bye-bye.
Bring your own matches.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
How are?
Where have you been?
Oh, I just went out to get a breath of fresh air.
Oh?
I worry about you when you're When you're not around.
Oh, do you, master?
Hm.
Yeah, well, I know it's silly, but I mean, what can happen to a genie?
Nothing, as long as her master is happy.
Are you happy, master?
Oh, yes, yes, I'm very happy.
Oh, I feel just wonderful.
I I'll tell you what.
Why don't you go and get ready, and we'll get the early show tonight?
I'm due at Dr. Bellows' office for a little examination tomorrow morning, huh?
Oh, do not worry.
I'm sure everything will be just fine.
Oh, sure, sure.
Have a wonderful day, master.
Thank you, Jeannie.
I won't be gone long.
Um, what would you like to do today?
Go to another movie?
Oh, well, no, master.
Too many movies are bad for my eyes.
Oh, well, um, what do you say I pick you up, we'll go down to the beach.
How would you like that?
Oh, well, that That would be wonderful, but, uh, what about your work?
Oh, they'll find somebody else to do that.
He has beautiful eyes.
He can see better than anybody else in the world.
"P-L-D-P-B-T-L-D-P-B-L".
Aw, good morning, Major Nelson.
Oh, good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Roll up your sleeve, please.
Oh, all right, sir.
How are we feeling this morning?
Well, we're feeling just fine.
Uh, did you know my vision cleared up?
Has it?
Yeah.
Why, that's remarkable.
Yeah, the eye strain just went away like that.
Did it?
Mm.
Yeah, I, uh, got a good night's sleep last night.
It's amazing what a good night's sleep will do for you.
You know, I-I was really worried for a while I wasn't gonna be able to make Project Rainbow.
And, uh, now, you're not worrying?
No.
No, sir.
I'm not worried at all.
I think you'll find I have 20-20 vision.
Hm, good.
Blood pressure normal.
I think you'll find everything normal, sir.
Nothing to worry about.
Mm.
All right, major.
Shall we, uh, read the eye chart again?
Yes, sir.
Sit down, major.
Yes.
Would you like me to start at the top or the bottom?
Why don't you start at the bottom.
We'll try a different chart.
Oh, uh, excuse me a minute, major.
Uh, I'll be right back.
Oh, Miss Gordon.
Will you get Major Nelson's file and bring it in here, please?
Of course, Dr. Bellows.
Where is it?
"Q-P-O " No.
"O-P-Q O-P".
What is it?
"O-P O-P"  Fine, I'll get it right away.
Thank you.
All right, major.
Shall we start?
Uh, don't you think you should wear a robe, sir?
A robe?
What for?
Well, aren't you afraid you'll catch cold?
Why would I be afraid of catching cold?
Oh Ahem.
I don't know.
There's no reason, really.

Hope so?
Major Nelson, can we get on with the examination?
Yes, oh, yes, yes.
Would you read the bottom line of the chart, please?
Uh, "P-R-I- V-A-T-E".
Major, I'm afraid your eyes are worse.
You didn't get a single letter right.
Are you joking, sir?
I can see it right there.
But it doesn't say "P-R-I-V ".
That spells "private".
Yes, sir.
It's on a door to a room, and there's a There's a conference going on in the room.
I can see through the wall.
Did you say you could see through the wall?

Just please don't say it.
Who told you about my eyes anyway?
I promised Major Healey that I would not tell.

Mission?
They won't let me outside of this room.
The problem could be General Peterson, Mr. Harris, Mr. Rogers and Colonel Sackheim.
Dr. Bellows.
He was right.
Do you realize we're in the middle of a private conference?
Uh, yes, sir.
That's why I came in.

Jeannie, if you'd stayed out of this, I would have had a chance.
Now, will you please stop helping me.
I will do anything you ask.
All right, then change my eyes back the way they were.
I-I am not sure I can do that.
What do you mean you're not sure?

Uh, good night, Jeannie.
Don't wait up for me.
No, master.
Have a good time.
Oh, I will.
I'm sorry to have to do this to you, but I feel you really needed a lesson.
Yes, master.
You're really rough on her.
Sometimes you have to be.
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
I'm ready, master.
How do I look?
Great, great, great.
What is that you are watching?
A horse opera.
An opera with horses?
No, it's a It's a Western.
That's the way people used to live in the old days.
And the only law and order was the marshal.
It reminds me of election day in old Baghdad.
In those days men really had to be men.
You make it sound so exciting.
It was.
I wish I lived in those days.
Isn't that something, Jeannie?
Oh.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Hey, look at that, boys.
We got us a new marshal.
Howdy, marshal.
Oh, uh, no, no.
No, I'm not your marshal.
When I count to three, I'm shootin'.
No, you don't understand, uh One, Jeannie.
Two, Jeannie.
Three.
Jeannie!
Oh.
Hit the leather, marshal.
Hey, wait!
Whoa!
Leave him alone, Bull.
I didn't mean no harm, Mr. Sedgewick.
I was just having a little bit of fun.
Fun?
You could've killed somebody.
Yeah.
What kind of a welcome is that for our new marshal?
Why, he's going to think Gopher Junction is uncivilized.
Beat it.
Yes, sir.
I-I, uh, apologize for that, marshal.
Oh, uh, that's all right.
Thanks for the help.
Listen, he should be locked up.
Well, I keep telling them that Gopher Junction is not gonna grow into a proper city unless we get some law and order around here.
Yeah, well, you may have some little wait.
Well, Bull doesn't mean any harm.
He just gets kind of carried away sometimes.
I'm Horace Sedgewick, the town banker.
Oh, hi.
I'm Tony Nelson.
Oh sorry.
Nelson, Nelson.
Well, I'm mighty glad to meet you, Mr. Nelson.
Come on, let me show you your office.
My office?
Yeah.
Eh  Is that your horse?
Um, yeah.
Yeah, I guess so.
Uh, where you hail from?
Cocoa Beach.
Is that east or west of Abilene?
East.
I'm sure mighty glad you're here, Mr. Nelson.
We haven't had a marshal since poor Ed Clampett.
Oh, what happened to Ed Clampett?
Same thing that happened to the last seven marshals.
Like I told you, the boys are kind of high-spirited.
You have quite a turnover here, don't you?
Well, the highest of any town in the West.
Huh?
Come on in.
Oh.
Oh, uh, I see we have a guest.
Oh, that's Eddie Sheridan.
But you don't have to bother about him, marshal.
He won't be with you long.
Why not?
Because they're gonna lynch me!
I'm innocent!
They'll kill me if you don't let me go!
Wha?
What'd he do?
He's the cold-bloodedest killer I ever seen, marshal.
Why, he shot down a rancher and his wife when they caught him rustling their cattle.
No, no, that's a lie!
I was nowhere near the Bar-X when they was killed.
Well, I'm sure all the facts will come out at the trial.
Oh, he's already had his trial, marshal.
Oh?
And the jury was very generous.
They gave him life imprisonment.
They gonna take him to the prison in Kansas City tonight.
When you get yourself all settled in here, come on over to the Silver Dollar Saloon.
I'll, uh, buy you a drink and introduce you all around.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
Oh, uh Heh-heh-heh.
Well, heh-heh, it's, uh, good to have you with us.
Thank you.
I didn't kill nobody!
I've been framed!
Framed.
They just want to get my ranch.
You gotta help me.
Well, uh, I-I'd like to help you very much, but, uh Well, I can't.
I'm just passing through.
Oh, sure.
Sure, I should've figured it.
You're in with them.
Them?
The Unholy Ten.
The Un The Unholy Ten?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm talking about that gang that's been trying to take over this territory.
They've hit every ranch within 100 miles of here!
Well, why?
Because they want the land, Mr. Marshal!
If you don't sell out to 'em at their price, they try to scare you out.
Well, there's really nothing I can do.
Ah, I You'll be safe in Kansas City.
Who are you kiddin'?
You know how far I'll get?
They built that for me.
There'll be a lynch mob here to get me at 6:00.
No.
No, I-I'm sure Mr. Sedgewick wouldn't allow anything like that.
I'll go talk to him.
There anything you need?
A marshal with guts.
Buy me a drink, honey?
Oh, uh Well, I'm just passing through.
Jeannie.
What are you doing?
Oh, you were right, master.
This is so exciting.
You don't know the half of it.
Are you ready to go home now?
Well, now that you're here, I think I'd like to stay until about 6:00.
Well, if that is what you wish, marshal.
Yeah, that's what Well, well.
If it ain't our new marshal.
Ahem.
Jeannie, you go and enjoy yourself.
All right, master.
All right.
You know, I ain't stopped shakin' since you come to town.
You look like a real killer.
Ain't he got a mean look?
If I wasn't right in the middle of a drink, I'd sure be runnin'.
What you drinkin', marshal?
Nothin', thank you.
I guess you didn't hear right, mister.
When my friend Al asks you to have a drink, you have a drink.
Well, I'm particular with whom I drink.
Now, you shouldn't have said that, stranger.
You just hurt my feelings.
And you know what happens when I get my feelings hurt?
You beat up little old ladies?
Can you do that?
'Cause if you can't, you're in a lot of trouble.
Pardon me.
Hey, Bull, he hit seven of 'em with a six-shooter.
Well, that calls for a drink, marshal.
Me and you'll be meetin' again, marshal.
Well, before we do, do you mind takin' a bath?
You smell terrible.
Bull!
I wouldn't push him too far if I were you, marshal.
It's not healthy.
I don't push  I don't push easy, Mr. Sedgewick.
Eh Oh, I was talking to Eddie Sheridan, and he thinks that they're gonna lynch him tonight.
Oh, heh-heh, I wouldn't pay too much attention to what Sheridan says.
He's a real troublemaker.
And, uh troublemakers don't last too long around here, marshal.
I'll see you later.
You must be the new marshal.
Oh, uh, no.
No, ma'am, I'm just traveling through.
I'm a tourist.
Please, help me.
Well, I'd like to very much, but, uh What's your problem?
I'm Eddie Sheridan's sister.
You've got to let him go.
Well, ma'am, I'm not a judge.
I'm I'm just a Well, whatever it is I am, I can't let him go.
You were our last chance.
Eddie and I were hoping the new marshal would save him.
Now, now.
That's That's not gonna do any good.
Uh, stop that.
Everybody's watching.
Everybody.
Here.
Take that.
Thank you.
They're not gonna stop till they've taken over every ranch in the valley.
"They're not gonna stop"?
Who's they?
They call themselves the Unholy Ten.
Well, what do they want with all this land?
I-I mean, the freeways won't be through here for another hundred years.
They want the land because the railroad's coming through Through and they want the right of way.
How did you know that?
I watch a lot of television.
Well Will you save Eddie?
Ma'am, as long as I'm marshal of Gopher Junction, there ain't nobody gonna get lynched.
Oh, thank you.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Well, I see you found a playmate.
How about spreadin' a little of that sunshine?
Hey, hey, get your hands off of her!
Oh, thank you, marshal.
I'll see you later.
Marshal, I got a feeling you're a big bluff.
Oh, yeah?
You know what I think.
I think that shootin' you done a while ago was purely accidental.
Let's take big mouth outside, boys.
Oh.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
It's too bad your visit was so short, marshal.
We're gonna miss you.
All right, knock it off!
I happen to be United States property.
If you let me go now, I'll let you off lightly.
Let him go.
Not this time, Mr. Sedgewick.
I don't like his face.
What do you think you're doing?
What time is it?
A quarter of 6.
Come on, boys.
Well, I'm glad they realized they was headin' for trouble.
Thank you, Mr. Sedgewick.
Don't think I'm gonna be able to help you next time, marshal.
Huh?
May we go home now, master?
No.
No, not yet, Jeannie.
There's something funny going on here, and I want to find out what it is.
Oh.
Well, please be careful.
They gotta learn respect for the law.
Marshal, come quickly!
Well, what's the matter?
It's my brother.
They're breaking into the jail.
They're gonna lynch him!
Not while I'm marshal of Gopher Junction they ain't.
I'll get me a posse.
All right, you men.
I need me a posse.
All volunteers raise your hands.
Never mind.
I'll do it myself.
Let's break the door down and teach Sheridan not to shoot helpless women!
Break it up!
I happen to be the marshal, you know.
Hey, it's the marshal!
Yeah, now Put me down.
Wait, fellas.
You're all overly-excited.
Now, I want you all to go home and get a good night's rest.
Let's get him, boys.
Kn Kno Knock it off.
I mean it.
Have you ever heard of the FBI?
The what?
Forget it.
I want you to get out of here, sister, before you get hurt.
But they'll kill you.
As long as I'm gopher of Marshal Junction, ain't nobody gonna get killed.
You got 60 seconds, marshal.
You send Sheridan out here or we're comin' in to get him!
You better do what they say, marshal.
Do what they say?
They're gonna lynch you.
They're gonna lynch me no matter what you do.
I just don't want Georgia gettin' hurt.
I told you, as long as I'm marshal, ain't nobody gonna get hurt.
What are you gonna do?
Go out and show 'em who's in charge, that's what.
Oh, please don't go out there.
They'll kill you.
There are worse ways of dyin', ma'am.
Oh.
Oh, you're the bravest man I've ever known.
Yeah.
Have you decided to be sensible, marshal?
All right, you men!
I'm gonna turn my back on you and I'm gonna count to 10.
When I turn around again, you better be gone or I'm gonna start shootin'.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, Well, that's better.
Uh, I'd like to thank the citizens of Gopher Junction for the way they handled themselves in this emergency.
Let's get him, boys!
Nothing can stop them.
Come on, I want you to let your brother out.
Here.
Oh, you were right, master.
This is getting more and more exciting.
Yeah, it's getting a little too exciting.
Oh, well, I'll get rid of them for you.
No, no, no, no.
I wanna do this myself.
I only wish I had some tear gas.
Jeannie.
Oh, Jeannie.
I Which one is it?
Agh!
Let that be a lesson to all of you.
I don't know how you did it, but I'm proud.
It's nothing.
Eddie, Eddie!
What is it, Josh?
It's the Unholy Ten.
They're rustli" your cattle.
Oh, no!
It's all we have left.
Master, why would they want to wrestle his cattle?
Not "wrestle," "rustle".
Rustle.
They're going to the Mexican border.
We'll head 'em off at the Pass.
Pass.
Come on, Jeannie.
Come on.
I-I'm sorry, master, but I am afraid of horses.
You're what?
Well, when I was a little girl, we always had camels, and then my uncle came over one day and Jeannie, I don't have time to psychoanalyze you.
The Unholy Ten are getting away with the cattle.
Now, come on.
Very well, master.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
I am not afraid of donkeys.
Forget it.
Isn't there anything we can do to stop the stampede?
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah, sure there is.
Come here, Jeannie.
Listen, you've got to stop the stampede.
Oh, well, I will be happy to, master.
What is a stampede?
Oh, well Well, that's when the cattle are all going this way, you see.
Oh, I see.
And you would like them to go this way?
Yeah, that's it.
Okay.
They turned around.
Yeah.
They're goin' the other way.
Sedgewick ain't gonna like this.
I don't like it neither.
Come on.
Where you goin'?
Back to town to get me a marshal.
Yes, yes.
Well, I see you're still here, marshal.
I don't push easy.
And if you take my advice, you'll be on your way out of town before Bull gets back.
Back from where?
Why, uh I don't know.
Wherever he went.
I know where he is.
Jeannie, I'll handle this myself.
I warned you about this prisoner.
He's a dangerous man.
He should be back in jail.
Yeah, Mr. Sheridan claims that he was framed.
Oh, he was, master, and I can tell you who did it.
Jeannie, I wanna do this myself.
Eddie and I won't be driven off our land, Mr. Sedgewick.
Well, I'm afraid it's not your land anymore, Miss Georgia.
There's a mortgage due next week, and you have no cattle left.
How do you know that, Mr. Sedgewick?
I know how he knew it.
Yeah, Jeannie, please.
I told you, I want to do it myself.
Very well.
Yeah.
Ahem.
Now, you were saying about the cattle?
Yes.
Uh, well, I I just heard that some rustlers ran them off.
Well, you heard wrong, Mr. Sedgewick.
I think we got some company.
I gotta talk to you.
Later.
This won't wait.
He has some very bad news for you.
Jeannie, please.
Well, he has.
Yeah Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.
No, really, I Are the cattle really safe?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
The cattle are fine.
You don't have to worry about a thing.
Oh, you're wonderful.
Oh, well  Please, uh, ma'am.
I'm I'm on duty.
What do you mean they reversed direction?
I can't explain it.
The cattle just suddenly turned around and went in the other direction.
You bunglin' fool.
Well, I don't know why, but I got a feeling the marshal's behind all of this.
Yeah, I got the same feelin'.
And I want you to take care of him.
My pleasure.
I don't wanna take any chances.
Al, Sam, you know what to do.
Right.
We'll fix him.
Sam, take the hotel.
I'll take the saloon.
Be careful.
Don't worry.
Hey, marshal!
Yeah?
My conscious has been botherin' me somethin' awful.
I killed that rancher and his wife.
Why don't you come and get me.
Take cover.
Ooh, I will stay with you, master.
No, no, Jeannie.
He's a killer.
Take cover.
Oh, but I I mean it.
Now!
All right, hold it right there, Bull.
You're through, Bull.
Well done, marshal.
I'll see to it that he's properly taken care of.
Jeannie.
The Unholy Ten.
It won't be hard to find out who the other nine are now.
I can tell you who.
It was Jeannie, next time I'm going to send you home.
Oh, I'm sorry, master.
Now, I figure that the only reason that the Unholy Ten have been able to terrorize the countryside and get away with it is because they got some pretty powerful backing.
Go on.
Now, this person has to be rich enough to be able to buy up the ranches once the owners have gotten scared off.
And that person is you, Mr. Sedgewick!
Me?
Ah, you're crazy!
Oh, he is not!
He  I have nothing to do with any of this.
Wait a minute.
You ain't leaving me to take the rap!
Shut up.
Yeah, let them hang me while you're runnin' around.
The whole thing was his idea.
All right, take him away.
Why But you   You got nothing to worry about, Ed, Georgia.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, you're the most wonderful man I've ever met in my whole life!
Well Well, uh Oh.
I'm just never gonna let you go!
Dinner is ready, master.
Hm?
Hm?
Oh, sorry, I must've dozed off, heh-heh.
What time is it, Jeannie?
A few minutes past 6.
Really?
Mm-hm.
I had the wildest dream.
It was so real.
Was it?
Yeah.
I dreamt I was in this In this town in the Wild West.
Well, forget it.
Are you hungry, master?
Mm.
Starved.
Gun fights always make me Let's eat.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Good morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, master.
Well, I'm on my way to the base now.
Oh, not without breakfast, master.
Everyone should start the day with a good hot breakfast.
Oh Uh  Jeannie Yep.
I know you are always in a hurry, master.
Yeah, well But this is one time that you must take time to eat.
Yes, except for one this Oh.
Oh.
You will feel much better after you have eaten, master.
Mm.
Well, it's very good except for I-I I don't Mm.
Is it not delicious?
Yeah.
Bacon a-and strawberries is a nice combination.
Yeah.
I think it's going a little too far.
Mm-hm.
There we are.
Eat it all up.
It will make you strong.
No, Jeannie, you must stop this.
Now Mm!
Mm.
Well Well, there, master.
Was that not good?
Marvelous.
There's only one problem.
Well, what is that, master?
I've already had my breakfast.
I'm sorry I upset you, master, but But how was I to know you already had your breakfast?
Well, it's not only today.
It's It's every day.
You don't do anything right.
You You don't have the A faintest idea of what to do as a genie.
You're an amateur's amateur.
Well, I I cannot help it, master.
I have not had much practice at being a genie.
Oh, ho, ho, yeah.
Well, I was a very young girl when the wicked jinn put me in my bottle.
Oh, and 2000 years later you rescued me.
All right, all right.
Come on, let's not get off the subject, huh?
You don't You You keep making mistakes.
Every time I open my mouth, you put my foot in it.
I casually mention the Wild West, and you have me dueling in the street.
I I-I say something about, uh, pirates, and there I am I'm having a fight with Captain Kidd.
I-it's getting so I I'm afraid to say anything.
Do you know what I would do, master?
Nothing.
Nothing.
But I can No, nothing.
I'm the only astronaut in the program that has a daily nervous breakdown.
All I wanted to do was give him a hot breakfast.
Morning.
You're a bundle of nerves today, aren't you?
Today?
Every day.
Listen, if I don't do something about Jeannie, she's gonna drive me out of my mind.
I'm Look Look at my reports.
What's?
Ah, look, I wouldn't do this for too many people, but, ah, I hate to see you suffer.
I'll take her.
Yeah Believe me, Roger, it's no fun getting everything you wish for.
Yeah.
I know what you mean.
Look, why don't I borrow her for For a year or two, and if it doesn't work out, I'll give her back to you?
Look, can't you be serious?
Be serious?
I've never been more serious in my life.
Look, you're dying to get rid of her and I'm dying to get her.
I'm not dying to get rid of her.
I just want her to learn how to act.
Look, Tony, I've never asked many favors of you, right?
Yeah.
Well, I met this girl.
I I need Jeannie so badly.
I've gotta impress this girl.
Everybody's nuts about her.
I just want her for a week.
I'm sorry, Roger.
Twenty-four hours?
No.
An hour?
No, Roger.
Five minutes?
Roger!
Would you let her wave to me?
Don't you understand?
You're gonna have just as much trouble as I'm having.
Well, look, if you feel that way, why Why don't you just sit down and have a heart-to-heart master-genie talk with her.
Oh, don't you think I've tried that?
It doesn't help.
She doesn't mean to get me in trouble.
It just Well, it just happens.
Well, that's probably because she's inexperienced.
She wasn't born a genie, you know.
She wasn't?
No.
Of course not.
She was turned into a genie when she was a young girl.
And I guess until I came along, she She just didn't have much practice at it.
Well, why don't you give her lessons.
Yeah, sure.
Well, I better be getting to the Test Chambers.
Wh-wh-what were you saying?
What was I saying?
Yeah.
I was saying I better get to the Test Chambers.
No, no, no, I-I I mean about Jeannie.
That's it, you solved the prob You're brilliant!
Well, I suppose I do have a knack for getting at the heart of things.
You sure do.
Well, I'm late, I, ah, better Ah, what is it I solved, exactly?
Oh, well, Jeannie's doing all these things to me because she doesn't know any better.
Now, all I have to do is Is get her a book on genie.
Like, uh Uh, b Maybe the Arabian Nights.
Yeah, that's it!
I'll give her a-a book on the Arabian Nights.
She can study it and learn how How genies behave.
And this-that's just brilliant of you, Roger.
Kind of a Doctor Spock at bringing up genies, huh?
Hm, yeah, that's right.
Do you know how I get these intuitions about things sometimes?
Yeah.
Yeah, what does it say to you?
Well, it says to me that you're headed for a disaster.
And if I were you, I'd stick to the nervous breakdown.
Yes.
Yeah.
Ah, lovely.
Ha.
These washing machines are truly miracles.
Jeannie?
Oh.
Jeannie.
Good evening, master.
Oh, hi.
I, uh, brought you a present.
Oh.
A gift!
Yes.
Oh, you are the most generous master I've ever known.
Well, it's really not that much, Jeannie.
It's just Oh, you are always doing things for me.
Yea Well, it's not that, uh, big a thing Deal, you know.
It is candy.
Uh, no.
No Oh, I love candy, master.
Jeannie, it's It's not candy.
It's a book.
Book?
Yes.
Tales Of The Arabian Nights.
Oh!
It is a book about my hometown.
Oh, I shall enjoy reading this, master.
As a matter of fact, I'd like you to study it.
Study it?
Yes.
Oh, it's It's full of exciting stories about genies and their masters, and you said this morning you didn't know much about being a genie, and I thought you could use this book as As kind of a textbook.
Oh!
You mean you wish me to do what the genies in these stories do?
It's not so much what they do.
It's what they don't do.
I don't pretend to be an expert on genies, but I I guess I know as much about them as the next man.
If there's anything a genie shouldn't do, it's drive their masters up the wall.
Oh, I do not mean to drive you up a wall I I know, I know I know you don't.
But we're not gonna have that problem now.
You see, all you have to do is follow the book.
Oh.
Follow the book.
That's right.
"And the genie bowed low and said to Aladdin, 'My wish is your command.
'"  Yeah.
That's wonderful.
You see?
Well I should've bought that book for you about a year ago.
Well, I will begin reading it tomorrow, master.
No, ah, we don't have any time to lose, Jeannie.
I'd like you to start reading it right now.
Okay?
Now?
Yeah.
Master.
Oh, did you finish the book?
No, master.
I cannot do as this book says.
Now, Jeannie, uh, we discussed this.
Now, you're gonna do exactly as it says.
But, master, you would not like it.
N You mean, you wouldn't like it.
It's time you learned a little discipline.
Oh, but I have discipline You're gonna have to behave like a proper genie.
Is that clear?
No.
A proper genie does not Argue with her master.
Now, I want you to go and finish that book.
And And that's an order.
Very well, master.
You are sure that is what you wish?
Yes.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
Yes, master.
"And the Blue Djinn said, 'The first thing you must do 'is to get your master at your mercy.
This is easier than you realize.
' Hm.
I should say so.
"'You must trick him.
Catch him off guard.
When he is at your mercy, torture him.
'"  Torture him!
No!
Master!
Have you finished it already?
Oh, no, master.
It is a terrible book.
Jeannie, for you it's terrible, for me it's great.
I cannot do the things it says.
I'm gonna give you a choice.
Either you behave like the genies in that book, or you're gonna have to get out of here.
Do you mean that?
I certainly do.
Oh Very well, master.
I tried.
"And the Blue Djinn said, 'And now, oh, genies, I will reveal to you 'ten ingenious tortures that I have devised.
The first one is known as the torture ' Oh Oh, no!
Major Healey.
Jeannie, don't you ever knock?
I I am sorry, Major Healey, but I have to talk to you.
I I-I need your advice.
Well, I haven't advised too many genies before, but, uh, what's your problem?
It is Major Nelson.
Ah, you mean the book.
You know about it?
Know about it?
He doesn't make a move without me.
Well, it is a terrible book.
If I do the things it says, Major Nelson will hate me and want to get rid of me.
Major Nelson will hate you and want You got to do exactly what that book says.
Exactly what Exactly.
If I do, he will not like it.
You're wrong.
He'll love it.
Well, he cannot have read that book.
Tales of the Arabian Nights?
Ho-ho-ho.
He was brought up on it.
He was?
Yeah.
And if you don't do exactly what that book says, he's going to be very angry.
Are you sure of this?
Sure of it?
I know him like a book.
And that's the book.
Modern men have strange ways.
Ahem.
Well, any time you need my advice, uh, just pop in, huh?

It's locked.
Do you have a key?
No, no.
How are you gonna get in your bedroom?

Let me in there.
Come on!
Ow!
Aah!
You mean, she locked you out of your room?

Honestly, Roge, I don't know what's gotten into her.
Well, I hate to say this, uh, Tony, but I think Jeannie is run amuck.
Run amuck?
Yeah.
It happens to genies sometimes.
And when it does Whew!
Really?
Really.
Look, you've got to get Jeannie to do exactly what that book says and don't let her argue with you.
Don't let her argue.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
You're absolutely right.
Thanks, Roge.
Don't forget.
No!
Run amuck?
Yuck.
Jeannie, I want to have Oh, master.
Oh, I've been so unhappy.
All I wish to do is please you.
Yeah, with what?
A-a bed of nails a-and an iron door in front of my bedroom?
Oh, well, I did not want to do any of those things.
Yeah, I-I suppose you had to.
We're We're not gonna have any more of that around here.
Tonight I'm sleeping in my own bed.
Oh, I am so glad.
Wh Uh, Jeannie, I can't figure you out.
Uh, you've never behaved this way before.
I mean, you used to get me into trouble, but you never planned it that way.
Oh, no, master.
I only want to make you happy.
Tell me, what can I do for you?
Well, that's That's more like it.
Command me to do anything, master.
How many chapters of that book you read?
Ten.
But I All right, I want you to do exactly what's in chapter ten.
Oh, no, master!
I cannot do that Now, you said you'd do anything I wanted.
Not that, master.
Yes, that, Jeannie.
Chapter ten.
Now.
Now?
Now.
Major Healey?
Jean Oh, Jeannie.
Oh, Jea Oh, Jeannie, uh, how's it goin'?
Terribly.
I think Major Nelson hates me.
Oh, he does, huh?
Oh, ho-ho, he does, uh?
Well, where is he now?
Hanging over a hungry group of crocodiles.
A hungry group of crocodiles?
He forced me to do it.
He said, "Do what is in chapter ten, now".
Crocodiles?
I do not know how to please him anymore.
If I do not follow the book, he yells at me.
If I do follow the book, he yells at me.
Lately he has been yelling at me all the time.
A-are they big crocodiles or small crocodiles?
Oh, please help me, Major Healey.
Help you Oh, help Well, I am helping you, I I don't know how to tell you this, uh, Jeannie, but, uh Your master's run amuck.
Run amuck?
Yeah.
It happens to masters sometimes.
When it does Whew!
Really?
Really.
And when it does, uh, I guess you have to find yourself a new master.
Oh, but I could not do that.
Well, is he happy?
No.
He's miserable.
Well, there you are.
You mean, the only way I can make him happy is to leave him?
I'm afraid so.
Well, I do not want to leave him, but if that is the only way I can make him happy, I guess I must.
But where will I go?
Well, since this, uh, is an emergency, uh, why don't I come to the rescue?
You mean, you would be my new master?
Well, that's the least I can do for my old friend.
Thank you, Major Healey.
Well, ahem, now that that's settled, uh, why don't you run home and get your bottle and come right back?
I got a few things I need.
Very well.
But I-I will release Major Nelson from the crocodiles, first.
Oh!
Oh, uh Uh, don't tell him, uh, anything about this.
Just get the bottle and come right back.
Yes, I will be right back.
Jeannie.
I can't hold on any  Jeannie!
Oh!
Are you all right, master?
How can I be all right?
I've got a genie who's run amuck.
Run amuck?
Yes, yes.
It happens to genies sometimes, you know.
Well, who should know better than you?
But Major Healey said that it was masters who run amuck.
Yeah.
Well, don't go around believing everything Ma Major Healey said that masters run amuck?
Yes.
He said that you hated me and that the only way to make you happy was to be his genie, and Ha Do not worry, master, I am going to be his genie because I want you to be happy.
That dirty That figures, that figures.
I will leave before you start yelling and getting angry with me again.
Roger!
No, no, no, no!
I don't want you to go anyplace.
I-I just want you to tell me what was in that book I asked you to read.
Oh, please do not make me follow that book again, master.
I-I'm not gonna make you.
Just tell me all about it.
Well it is a book of tortures that genies do to their masters.
That genies do to their Why that Yes, master, but I'm so sorry.
I did not want to do any of them.
Oh, Jeannie, it's not your fault.
It's mine.
Yours?
Yes.
But when you care for somebody, I mean, when you really care for somebody, you don't try to change 'em.
You take the good with the bad, and you You be thankful for what you got.
And I forgot to be thankful.
I tried to change you, and I was wrong.
And I'm I'm sorry.
Do you mean that, master?
Yes, I mean that.
Oh.
I am so happy.
What shall I do about Major Healey?
May I have the book, please?

Hm?
Oh, about, uh, running amuck, you know.
Oh, running amuck, huh?
She told you, huh?
Yeah.
Well, it was funny.
Ha, ha I wouldn't have done it, Tony, but I needed Jeannie desperately.
And, well, I tried to tell you before.
Do you remember?
Oh, yes, yes, I remember.
Yes.
Yes.
And, uh You wouldn't give her to me, so, I, uh  I would love to see you with those crocodiles.
No hard feelings?
Well, you two surely know how to take a joke.
Ha, ha!
Now.
N-now?
Now.
Jeannie!
Oh.
Go away.
Go away!
Shoo!
This is my iceberg.
Get your own iceberg.
This is my iceberg.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Good evening, master.
You did not tell me you were going out tonight.
Oh, didn't I?
Mm-mm.
Well, it must have slipped my mind.
You are all dressed up.
I am ready.
Where are we going tonight, master?
Well, we are not going anywhere.
I have a date tonight with an old friend of mine from Chicago.
Jeannie, what do you think you're doing?
You have been working much too hard lately, master.
It would be better if you stayed home and rested.
Well, I I'll decide that.
Now, I'm going out.
And, uh, this jealousy of yours is ridiculous.
Oh, well, I am not jealous, master.
Who is this girlfriend?
She's Uh, he's a very old school chum of mine from Ohio.
Uh Yes, we went to school together, and, well, he's in town now, and he's sick and, well, I'm gonna go and visit the poor guy.
Ah.
What is her name?
Suzie.
Charlie Suzie.
Oh, master, thou art not dealing with a stupid genie.
You will stay home tonight.
No, I'm not.
I promised I'd visit him, and visit him I'm going to.
Now, come on, give me my clothes.
No, master.
Ah!
All right, then I'll go and get dressed myself.
You can make me late, but you can't keep me here.
This is not a jail, you know.
Jeannie!
Let me out of here.
How long you in for?
Well, I'm sure glad I came during visiting hours.
Roger, will you get me out of here?
How did you get there in the first place?
How do you think I got here?
Jeannie?
Oh, brilliant.
Oh, marvelous.
Brilliant!
Boy, you must have really upset her.
Uh, well, what did you do?
I didn't do anything.
I just tried to get out of the house to keep a date.
Dressed like that?
No wonder she locked you up.
Yeah.
Jeannie!
I'm gonna be late if you don't get me out of here.
Look, uh I'm not doing anything tonight.
Why don't I, uh, make the date for you?
Thank you, this is one date I'm keeping myself.
Well, I just thought we'd play a little game of rummy, but the warden wouldn't like that.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, maybe I could smuggle a cake in here with a file in it, huh?
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Would you like a cake?
No.
No, I want a hacksaw.
See if you can find one for me, will you?
I think there's one out in the garage.
Hacksaw.
Yeah.
Good idea.
Ah, don't go away.
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh, God.
Good evening, Major Healey.
Oh, hey, Jeannie.
Uh, I'll be right back.
I'm going to get the hacksaw.
Roger!
I think it would be best if Major Nelson spent the night here.
He needs a good rest.
Well, I think that's for Major Nelson to decide.
Uh, I'll go and get the you-know-what.
Excuse me, Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Help!
Is there anything you would like, master?
Yes.
Yes, I-I want you to get rid of this jealousy bit.
I'm gonna cure you if it kills me.
Oh, I told you, master.
I am not jealous.
Well, then, what am I doing in jail?
What kind of a genie are you anyhow?
You're supposed to To help me.
You're supposed to make me happy.
Well, I try to make you happy, master.
Please believe me.
I'm doing this for your own good.
Now, go to sleep and rest.
There.
Oh!
Good evening, doctor.
Good evening, major.
It's a jail.
Yeah, I guess, but I know it looks like a-a jail.
In the middle of your living room.
Hmm.
Major, tell me, uh, what are you doing in your pajamas in a jail in the middle of your living room?
Uh, well, as a matter of fact, I was working Working on an experiment.
This time, major, I'm not buying.
No?
You think I'm gonna rush back and tell General Peterson that you're here in jail.
And then he'll say to me, "Doctor, you better be right this time, or I'll have you analyzed again".
And then I'll say, "Oh, no, General.
I saw it with my own eyes".
And then I'll bring him back here, and there won't be any jail, and he'll have me analyzed again.
Is that what you think?
Well, uh, no You're wrong.
Do you know how many times I've been analyzed in the last six months?
I'm seeing three different analysts, three times a week.
Hm.
Makes life rather difficult.
I'm sorry about that, sir.
It, uh, looks like a real jail.
It, uh, feels like a real jail.
Oh, that's a nice touch.
Well, if, uh If you want a jail in your living room, good luck.
Good night, major.
Pleasant dreams.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Good morning, master.
Yeow!
Did you sleep well, master?
No, I did not sleep well, Jeannie.
And do you know why I did not sleep well?
It's because you made me break a date with a very old and trusted friend.
Now, how do you think he felt, me not showing up?
Oh, you do not have to pretend with me, master.
I know you did not have a date with a man named Charlie Suzie.
Hello.
Major Nelson's residence.
Who is calling, please?
Charlie Suzie?
Hello.
Hello, Charlie?
Where was I last night?
Well, I I was tied up.
Yeah.
I-I'm terribly sorry.
You You waited for me for two hours?
Well, I-I'm terribly sorry, I just couldn't get shook loose.
Oh, master.
It's easy enough for you to say, "Oh, master".
But you just broke the heart of a very old friend of mine.
Hello.
Wh-what about tonight, Charlie?
Yes, of course I'll be there.
Will I be there?
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm so sorry.
I did not Yes.
Right, I'll be there tonight.
Same time, same place.
Right, Charlie.
And I'm terribly sorry.
Right, okay.
I do not know what to say.
Well, I guess you'll just have to learn to trust me.
Oh, my poor master.
I thought you had a date with a beaut Well, I will never, never doubt you again.
Well, we just have to live and learn.
Hi, Roge.
"Hi, Roge".
Fine friend you are.
What's the matter?
Where were you when I was hanging from the top of the.
Empire State Building all night long?
What were you doing that for?
"What was I doing that for"?
Oh, Jeannie.
Yeah, Jeannie.
Sometimes I get the feeling she's not so crazy about me.
Oh, Roge, she's just a little impulsive, that's all.
A little impulsive?
Do you have any idea how windy it gets up there?
I'll bet you are pretty sore at her yourself, keeping you locked up in jail like that all night long.
I spent the night in jail because that's exactly where I wanted to be.
Oh, come on, who are you kidding?
The master was outmaneuvered.
She caught you sneaking on a date and she locked you up.
There was a little maneuvering last night, but I'm the one who did it.
What are you What are you talking about now?
Well, I didn't have a date last night.
I just pretended to have a date.
Here, you want some coffee?
Well, why would you do that?
So I could have a sergeant on the base here named Charlie Suzie call me up and complain about my breaking the date I didn't have.
You lost me.
Roger, my real date is tonight with a girl named Joan Sheldon.
I used to go with her in Chicago.
One sugar.
One of the most beautiful girls I've ever seen in my life.
Well, Jeannie would have tried to stop me.
And, uh, now I'm going with her blessing.
That's the sneakiest idea I've ever heard in my whole life.
Sometimes you have to be a little sneaky when you handle Jeannie.
Ha-ha-ha!
You should have seen her this morning.
She couldn't do enough for me.
I really got to hand it to you.
Uh Look, you wouldn't like to make that a double date, would you?
Tonight?
No.
No.
Joan and I have a lot of time to catch up on.
You want some more coffee?
No.
Tony.
Come in.
Joan.
Joan, has it been five years?
Uh-uh.
Six.
Six?
Well, you haven't changed a bit.
And neither have you.
Ha-ha!
How are you, Tony?
I'm just fine.
Just fine.
And I can see how you are.
You're more beautiful than ever, Joan.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, thank you.
They're lovely.
Oh, I can't tell you how much I've missed you.
Well, I've missed you too.
Now, if you're ready, I have dinner reservations at Mateo's, and then I thought we'd go to a new play that just opened, and then, perhaps, later to the Blue Dolphin for dancing.
I thought it would be cozier to have dinner here.
Huh?
Do you mind?
I hate crowds.
So do I.  Let me get into something comfortable.
Tony!
Tony!
Tony!
Tony!
Good evening, Major Healey.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Has Tony left yet?
Oh, yes.
He had a very important date with an old friend.
Oh, a date.
Mm-hm.
Mr. Charlie Suzie.
Oh, good old Charlie Suzie.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh, I hope Major Nelson has a wonderful time.
He's probably gonna have the greatest time of his life.
Ha-ha-ha!
Ho-ho-ho!
Ho-ho!
Well, he's probably going to have a nice time.
He's gonna have an average evening.
Guess I better be running along.
Ha-ha-ha!
What are you doing?
What?
What did you mean, "ho-ho, he-he," Major Healey?
Jeannie, get me out of here.
Not until you tell me what is happening to Major Nelson.
Oh, "happening to Major Nelson".
Nothing's happening to Major Nelson.
Look, I've got a meeting with Dr. Bellows and I'm late.
Well, I will let you go as soon as you tell me about Major Nelson.
Is he in trouble?
I think he is now.
Well, I'm sure that Mr. Charlie Suzie would not hurt him.
Yeah, Charlie Suzie wouldn't hurt him.
C-c-can I go now?
If he is with Mr. Charlie Suzie.
I think I have been tricked.
Jeannie, don't do anything hasty.
Nice Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
There.
Isn't that better?
Oh!
Yes, it certainly is.
It looks much more comfortable.
Here.
To us.
I'll drink to that.
I'm sorry.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Hello, master.
Oh.
Are you still angry?
No.
I said I was sorry, master.
Truly I am.
You cannot move out, master.
This is your home.
Really?
I haven't had that impression recently.
If you'd only told me the truth I would not have done that.
Yet if I had told you the truth, you wouldn't have let me keep that date, would you?
Huh?
And do you know why you wouldn't let me keep that date?
Oh, yes, master.
Because I love you very much and I'm very jealous of you.
Oh, Jeannie, we've been through this a hundred times.
Would you please stop that?
If you do not go away, I will do anything you want me to.
Except leave me alone.
Oh, no, master.
Truly, I promise.
If you wish to go back to see that girl tonight, I will not stop you.
How could I ever face her again?
You made a monkey out of her.
Oh, but I changed her back.
Oh, she will not remember anything that happened.
You really wouldn't mind if I went back there?
Well, I I did not say that I would not mind.
I said that I would not stop you.
You promise?
I promise.
Hm.
Master?
Yes.
Oh, well, thank you.
You are welcome.
Tony.
Come in.
Joan.
Has it been five years?
Uh-uh.
Six.
Six.
Well, you haven't changed a bit.
And neither have you.
How are you?
I'm fine, Joan, fine.
And I can see how you are.
Why, you're more beautiful than ever.
Oh, sorry.
Oh, thank you.
They're lovely.
I can't tell you how much I've missed you, Tony.
Joan, I've missed you.
And I've been thinking Why don't we have dinner here instead of going out.
You're a mind reader.
Well, what do you know about that.
I thought it would be cozier to have dinner here.
Do you mind?
I hate crowds.
I know.
I mean, so do I. Let me get into something comfortable.
Tony!
Tony!
Jeannie!
Oh.
Oh, there you are.
Where's Tony?
Major Nelson has already left.
Well, you better get him back right away.
But why?
Look who he has a date with.
"Mobster escapes.
Two Gun Richard Sheldon breaks out of prison to kill wife".
You mean she is the wife of a mobster?
Well, that is terrible!
Terrible?
It's disastrous.
What is a mobster?
A mobster?
A mobster is a crook, you know, like, "You dirty rat"!
Uh, he's the leader of a gang.
You know, and if he catches Tony with his wife, he'll kill him.
Y-y-you've gotta stop him right away.
Oh, I cannot.
This is a matter of life or death.
I'm sorry.
Major Nelson made me promise never to interfere again.
We've been talking about me all this time now.
You haven't said a word about yourself, Joan.
Well, there's not that much to tell.
After you dropped out of my life, I went to Detroit and And got a job in a nightclub.
Funny.
A beautiful girl like you, never getting married.
More champagne?
No, no, not right now.
Tony, I wonder if I could ask a little favor of you?
Sure.
I'm holding something for a friend of mine and it makes me a little nervous keeping it in the hotel.
Why don't you have the hotel put it in their vault?
I don't trust vaults.
But I trust you, Tony.
Oh.
What?
What do you want me to do with it?
Just keep it, honey.
Just keep it.
Don't go away.
You're taking an awful chance, Two Gun.
There's fuzz all over the place.
They can have me after I fix her.
Is this it?
Yeah.
There's a guy in there with her.
Who is he?
I don't know.
Well, I'll take care of the both of them.
Give me the key.
Oh.
Be ready to move fast.
Didn't expect to see me, did you?
Jeannie, I knew I couldn't trust you.
I What are you do?
What are you doing here?
I'm here to fix you for being with Joan.
Ah, well, I'm warning you for the last time.
Go home.
Go home?
If you blink out now, I may, I just may forgive you.
Now, hurry up.
Blink out.
Do you know who I am?
Shh.
Of course I know who you are.
That's why I want you out of here.
Now, go home and I don't want you to come back.
You know, you've got a lot of nerve coming here.
I have a good mind to put you over my knee and give you a good, solid spanking.
Well, don't just sit there.
Two Gun Richard is a professional killer.
He'll chop Tony into little pieces.
I cannot go.
I promised.
Besides, Major Nelson is a very brave man.
He can take care of himself.
Yeah, that's right.
He can take care of himself.
He does not really need me.
No.
He  Do you believe that?
No.
Neither do I. Oh.
I want you to go home and write, "I will never be jealous again," one thousand times.
All right, smart mouth.
Nobody talks to Two Gun that way.
Now, you put that silly toy away before I bend you over my knee.
And the next time you pretend to be a gangster, at least try to look like one.
It's certainly a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Two Gun.
It'll be your last pleasure.
Now, what'd you do with my wife?
Your wife?
Well, I-I didn't do anything with your wife.
I I didn't even know you were married.
Tony!
Yeah?
Tony, you've got to get out of here before my husband Richard.
This is your wife?
Well, I must say, you certainly picked a charming girl.
Congratulations to you both.
I've got to be saying good evening now.
I've got some You ain't going nowhere.
Don't kill him.
Why Why would you want to kill me?
I'm an old friend of the family.
Tell him.
Where's the dough?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't give me that, baby.
You took it.
Now, just a moment.
That's a terrible accusation to make against your own wife.
You're in this together.
I want that money.
Give it to me and I won't kill you.
I'd love to give it to you.
I can't it to you.
I don't have it.
It was in a brown package.
A brown package.
Well, I don't know anything about a brown package.
That's it.
All right.
Now, which one of you wants it first?
Wait a minute.
Y-you said if we gave you the money you wouldn't kill us.
I've got a short memory.
Pleasant dreams, sweetheart.
Two Gun!
Cops.
All around the place.
What are we gonna do?
TWO  Fight it out.
They got machine guns.
Machine guns?
I surrender.
Here.
All right.
All right, gentlemen, shall we go?
You won't need me.
I'll just wait here.
I'm sorry.
We're all going down to the station.
Would you mind getting over there with them?
I'm sorry about our engagement tonight, I just remembered I have a dinner engagement in an hour at At the Golden Slipper.
All right, gentlemen, let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.
You too.
Come on, come on, come on, come on.
Are you enjoying this, master?
Mm.
It's a nice, quiet game, Jeannie.
I was afraid that it might be too quiet for you.
After all the excitement the other night, I could take about a year of this.
Oh, I am glad.
You know, that phone hasn't rung once in the last three days.
Oh, has it not?
Hmm.
Oh, hello, operator?
No, nothing.
I just wanted to check the line and see if it was all right.
Yeah, thanks.
Well, it's been so quiet around here, if that phone rang, I'd be very much surprised.
So would I, master.
Oh.
Heh.
Oh, master, you let me win that one.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Jeannie.
Jeannie, come on out.
Jeannie.
Good morning, master.
Ah, good morning, Jeannie.
Oh, my, you look handsome this morning.
Thank you.
I'd like to ask a favor of you.
Oh, thank you, master.
You haven't heard what it is.
Oh, it does not matter.
You never give me a chance to do anything for you.
Oh, well, this is not exactly for me.
It's for Roger.
Uh, he's got a birthday coming up next week, and I wanna give him a surprise party.
Oh, I love surprises.
Yeah.
Yeah, I know.
I've invited a few of his friends over here, and I'll keep him at the base just as long as possible, yeah.
I don't want him to suspect anything.
Wh-what is it you want me to do, master?
Well, I haven't had any time to plan for the party.
I I want something different, you know.
Oh, we used to have some wonderful parties in the old days.
Yeah, I'll bet you did.
So I was wondering if you could come up with an idea for the party.
Oh, yes!
I remember a party that Nero gave.
Yeah?
Well, no, no.
I don't want anything quite that extravagant.
Hi, there, fella.
Oh!
Hey, you're a mean-looking thing, aren't ya?
You're having a circus?
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Would you mind telling me what that's doing here, major?
Yes, I suppose it does seem strange.
No, no.
Doesn't everyone have a tiger in his living room?
Well, you see, Roger's having a He has a birthday coming up, and I wanted to do something special for him.
Feed him to the tiger?
Oh, no.
No, no.
You see, uh  Well, I I just want to give him a surprise party, something like, uh Well, like Nero used to do, you know.
I not only don't know, I'm sorry I asked.
General Peterson wants to see you and Major Healey in the computer room at 11:00.
Yes, sir.
And, uh come alone.
Yes, sir.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, where are ya?
Come on.
Jean Oh!
Would you mind, please?
Oh.
Thanks.
Well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I I think we'd better think of something a little simpler.
Oh, yes, master.
Oh, it must be wonderful to have someone give you a birthday party.
Well, you should know.
You must have had hundreds Thousands of 'em.
Oh, I have never had a birthday party, master.
You haven't had?
Well, now, how can that be?
I do not know when my birthday is.
Well, I think that's terrible.
Well, it is a strange feeling not to know when you were born.
It usually does not bother me, but when I see someone else is having a birthday, I I do wish I knew when mine was.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you celebrate Roger's birthday with him.
We'll make that your birthday party.
Oh, no, thank you, master.
It would not be the same thing.
I would like to have a birthday of my very own.
Heh.
Yeah.
Oh, do not worry about it.
Forget I ever mentioned No, I'm not gonna forget about it.
I'm gonna find out when your birthday is.
How?
Uh You go home and ask your mother.
Oh.
Well, it was so long ago, master.
She may have forgotten.
Believe me, mothers always remember birthdays.
Do you really think so?
Yes.
Yes.
I'll, uh, tell you what you do.
You go and find out when your birthday is, you come back and tell me, and I'll give you the biggest and best birthday party anybody ever saw in Cocoa Beach.
Oh!
You're wonderful, master.
Oh, I am so happy.
Now, I'm going to be just like everybody else.
Yes.
Well, maybe.
Have a good trip.
Oh, thank you, master.
Oh, goodbye, master.
Goodbye.
Hi, Tony.
Oh, hi, Roge.
Where's, uh?
Where's Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Oh, she went home to her mother.
Home to her mother?
You two quarrel?
No, no.
She went home to find out when her birthday was.
You mean, she doesn't know?
No.
No.
When she gets back and tells me, I'm gonna give her a birthday party she'll never forget.
You wanna help me?
Okay, you pay for the candles, I'll pay for the party.
Heh, heh.
Come in.
Well, good morning, gentlemen.
Morning, sir.
Good morning, sir.
Well, if, uh, you gentlemen are ready, General Peterson's waiting.
Would you mind telling me what this is all about, sir?
Not at all.
General Peterson wants you to meet ERIC.
ERIC?
You mean, this whole room is ERIC?
Electronic Rapid Input Computer.
This is the fastest computing machine in existence.
It can figure out the answer to any question you put to it.
I wonder if it can tell me about that redhead I have a date with Saturday night?
Don't press your luck.
That machine cost I just wanted you both to be aware it's available to help you solve any problems you may run into.
Here's the control panel.
Here's the manual.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I'm sure ERIC's gonna be a great help.
If you need this machine, just let me know.
I'll have Captain Reynolds program it for you.
Yes, sir.
Five million dollars.
How 'bout that, huh?
Ahhh.
You little devil.
Ho, ho, ho.
I bet you could tell me about that redhead I have a date with, huh?
You know, I've been thinking about this.
Now, if ERIC could give us the ratios on this input chart, we could save about a week's work.
Well, what'll they think of next?
Master, I am back.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Hi, Jeannie.
Did you have a nice trip?
Mm, nice trip, master.
Did you see your mother?
Yes, master.
How is she?
Oh, she's fine, thank you.
Did you find out the day you were born?
My mother says I was born in February, master.
February?
You're an Aquarius.
Uh, what?
What day in February?
It does not matter, master.
My father says I was born in December.
He remembers the icicles hanging from the roof.
My sister says it was in June because she remembers picking roses to bring to me.
Our next-door neighbor swears it was in October.
Oh, it was so long ago, nobody remembers what month it was.
You mean, there There's no clue at all?
Well, all anyone is sure of is that the planet Neptune was in Scorpio when I was born.
Neptune was in what?
Those are astrological signs.
Uh, weren't there any records kept?
Records?
Yeah, well, usually when a child is born, there's some kind of a record kept.
Uh, wasn't there the equivalent of a Hall of Records?
Of course.
I remember now.
The Emperor Caligula had everything removed to the courthouse of ancient Rome.
Oh, it will be there.
Oh, you are brilliant, master.
I will be right back.
You know, I'm generally not too fond of genies, - but, uh Whew!
- She's an exception.
Good evening, master.
Good evening, Jeannie.
Say, I was beginning to worry about you.
Did you find the records?
No, master.
The Hall of Records burned down during the great fire of 64 when Rome burned.
Oh, while Nero fiddled.
How did you know that?
Well, never mind.
Say, Jeannie, I'll tell you what.
Why don't we, um?
Why don't we just pick a day and celebrate that as your birthday, hm?
No, master.
I want my own birthday.
Yeah, well, I know, but when we can't find out what it is, you just have to pick the next best thing.
No, master.
I do not want the next best thing.
I I want the best thing.
Yes, I know, but My own birthday.
Jeannie, look.
Well, I I just can't get it for you, that's all.
It's humanly impossible.
You are my master.
Yes.
If you cared for me, you would find my birthday.
Yeah, but how?
Oh, you will think of something.
Good night, master.
How do I get myself into these things?
How do I get myself into these things?
Come in!
Hi.
Oh, hi, Tony.
What brings you here?
I need your help.
Oh, my help?
What, is anything wrong?
Yeah.
Jeannie couldn't find the records on her birthday.
Oh, that's That's too bad, Tony.
She expects me to find out when her birthday was.
It was 2000 years ago.
Well, you came to the right man for advice.
You mean, you know what to do?
'Course I do.
What?
Lie to her.
Pick a day out of a hat.
She'll never know the difference.
I couldn't do that.
Well, why not?
It wouldn't be right.
Well, if your conscience bothers you, uh, just tell her you picked a day out of a hat.
I already did.
I gave her your birthday.
What did she say?
Well, she wants her own birthday.
Now, come on.
Help me, will you?
Help you pick out a day that happened 2000 years ago?
What do you think I am?
ERIC?
That's it.
What's it?
I'm ERIC?
No, ERIC's gonna help me solve the problem.
What are you talking about?
I mean, ERIC only operates if you feed it information, and we don't have any.
Sure we do.
Sure we do.
We know that, uh, Neptune was in what, uh?
What?
What?
Scorpio?
Was in Scorpio the day she was born.
What kind of clue is that?
Well, it's the only one we've got.
Neptune's been in Scorpio millions of times.
Well, once, maybe.
All right, but we know she was born about 2000 years ago.
That narrows it down.
Oh Yeah.
And if General Peterson catches us fooling around with that machine, he's gonna narrow us down.
It's the only way we're gonna find that date.
You with me?
Okay, I'm with you.
Boy.
Well, I guess we sink together.
This is wax.
I know, they're all wax.
Good morning, Roge.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to sink without me.
What do you mean?
Can I come in?
Oh, sure, come on in.
Boy, I couldn't sleep at all last night.
I hate to tell you, but I can't go through with this.
You can't go through with what?
ERIC!
We get caught fooling around with that thing, we're gonna get wiped out.
Believe me, Jeannie will forget about her birthday.
I'm not so sure about that.
I know women better than you.
What's life and death today will be forgotten tomorrow.
Yeah, well, I hope you're right.
What are you doing?
Oh, forgive me, master, but whenever I get unhappy, my powers weaken.
Yeah, well  That vase cost a lot of I paid a lot of money for that.
Oh, do not worry, master.
I will get you another one.
What is that?
It's a Christmas present for Dr. Bellows.
Oh, forgive me, master.
Oh, boy.
Oh, if you could only find out when my birthday is Yeah, well, I'm afraid it happened a long time ago, Jeannie.
We've run into trouble.
What?
What are you doing?
Doing?
I I don't want to be rude or anything, but, ahem, one of your feet is missing.
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
Oh, whenever I am very unhappy, I begin to vanish.
You vanish?
Vanish?
Yes.
Jeannie, you stop that right now.
I cannot help it, master.
Goodbye.
Goodbye?
Goodbye?
Now, don't fade away.
This is your master talking.
I cannot help it, master.
If I am unhappy, I just fade.
Well, you get happy, and I mean it.
I mean, right now!
You think this is the right way to handle this problem?
Oh, uh Yeah.
Yeah, you're absolutely right.
Let's think of happy things, shall we?
Oh, yes, yes, master.
I do not want to vanish.
Yeah.
Now, um, what about the picnic we had?
Oh, yes, that That was a lovely day.
Remember in the museum when you found your slippers?
Oh, yes!
I enjoyed that.
Hey.
Hey!
One of her feet's back.
Hey, how 'bout that?
Oh!
Now, what about the time when the, uh When I stuffed the Blue Djinn in the vacuum cleaner, and you got rid of him, remember?
Yes.
Oh, that was funny.
I could never forget that, master.
Yeah.
Hey, both her feet are back.
Oh!
Thank you, master.
Ha, ha.
You just keep thinking happy thoughts, okay?
I will.
I will.
Good girl.
Who needs a birthday anyway?
Heh.
Oh, no!
Nice work, Roger.
Oh, I was only I can feel myself vanishing again.
Hold on, Jeannie.
I'm afraid I cannot stay if I do not know my birthday.
We're gonna find out your birthday.
I I thought you said there was no way.
Well Well, we have a way.
Yeah, it's It's known as a suicide mission.
Jeannie, just hold on.
Give us a little time.
I will try, master.
Just think about the time Don't say a word.
I was only Not a word.
Come on.
Can I ask you where we're going?
To see ERIC.
Can I say one word?
What's that?
Help.
Wait Wait a minute.
Know what's gonna happen to us if we get caught?
Don't think about it.
It's easy for you to say.
Roger, I want you to stay out here and warn me if anybody comes.
Yeah, I'll give you two sharp whistles.
Sharp, sharp.
What is it?
I was just practicing.
Sorry.
Tony.
Tony.
What are you doing in here?
What am I doing in here?
Will you hurry up?
You've been in here over an hour.
Well, I'm almost through.
Do you know what you're doing?
Yeah, I know what I'm doing.
I just hope ERIC knows what he's doing.
I'm feeding him the information.
We ought to have the answer in a minute.
If you ask me, it looks stupid.
Huh?
I said, if you ask me, it looks stupid.
Would you go out and guard the door?
Two sharp whistles.
Right.
Two.
Sharp.
Okay.
Major Healey.
Yes, sir.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes, sir.
It's a friend of mine that I'm worried about.
Anyone I know?
Well, not exactly, sir.
You see, I have a 15-year-old cousin, and she fell in love with the milkman.
'Course, the family made her stop drinking milk altogether.
That became a malnutrition problem.
Of course, we got Dr. Bellows?
Oh!
Well, I think we've done it.
Do you?
Yes, yes.
Oh!
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
What are you doing here, sir?
The question is: What are you doing with this machine, Major Nelson?
What machine, sir?
That machine.
Oh, ERIC.
I I think of him as human.
Thanks a lot, Roger.
You haven't answered my question.
What question was that?
What are you doing?
Oh, yes.
I was feeding it some information.
I'm trying to find a certain date.
Yes, and if he doesn't find the date, a certain thing he's got could disappear.
Oh, I see.
You're computing a launch date.
Yes, you might say that.
Is the machine being helpful?
I certainly hope so, sir.
Well, I think that General Peterson will be very pleased that you're using it.
Yes, sir, he's gonna get a real kick out of it.
You had no trouble programming it?
No, sir.
Good.
Well, uh, I'll leave you to your work.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, no.
Uh, not now.
Wow!
You're getting a readout.
Uh Yes.
May I see it?
Sir?
I said, may I see it?
I don't think it'll be anything you'd be interested in, sir.
Oh, I'm fascinated by these machines.
May I?
Yeah, all right.
There you are.
No, no, no.
The entire slip.
Oh, yes.
You were born in the year 64 B.C. BOTH : Sixty-four B.C. What kind of data is that?
Oh.
Well, I I must have fed it some wrong information.
Oh.
It had a case of indigestion.
Yes.
Does it say anything else?
Yes, it gives a birth date.
It does?
May I have the date, sir?
Major Nelson, if you think ERIC is a Chinese fortune cookie, you're very much mistaken.
In the future, if you want to use this machine, Captain Reynolds will program it for you.
Is that clear?
I'll hold those for I said, is that clear?
Yes, yeah Uh, uh Would you mind giving me the date, sir?
As a matter of fact, I would.
Now, if you gentlemen are through with your games.
Gotta do this all over again.
Major Nelson!
What is it?
Major Nelson!
Yes, sir.
Did you understand what I said?
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.
I had it in my hand.
I had the date right in my hand.
Do you understand that?
We could've knocked Dr. Bellows down and taken it away from him.
Oh, good thinking.
Yeah, that's great.
Master, I came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
You can't go, Jeannie.
Looks like she's half-gone already.
Oh, I'm sorry, master, but when I am unhappy, I just Oh, I have no control over this.
Remember when I found you in the bottle on the beach, and I opened it up and you were so happy?
It is no use, master.
I am slipping away.
Remember the time I let you drive my car?
Remember?
Do not forget me, master, please.
Major Nelson is using ERIC to find out somebody's birthday?
I was there, sir.
Why would he do that?
I have no idea, general.
Maybe we should ask ERIC.
What?
Oh, uh, nothing, sir.
Oh, um, this is the, um The date the machine gave him.
He seemed most anxious to have it.
Hm.
My mother was born on that day.
But, uh, not in 64 B.C. Sixty-four B.C.?
Yes, sir.
The person they were looking up was born in that year.
Sounds to me like ERIC had a breakdown.
That's what they tried to claim.
No, general, there's something behind this.
For some reason, this date is most important to Major Nelson.
But he didn't say why?
Uh, no, sir.
I told him to stay away from ERIC, unless Captain Reynolds was there to program his questions.
I want you to rescind that order.
But why, sir?
Let Major Nelson use the machine any time he wants to, only he'll be watched.
That's an excellent idea, sir.
He's going to Alaska for two weeks.
I'll tell him when he returns that ERIC will be available to him.
The next time the machine gives him any information, I want it sent directly to me.
I don't want Major Nelson to see it.
Hm.
Amazing.
What's amazing?
That it took a 5-million-dollar computer to catch Major Nelson.
Uh moonlight ride in the park.
A chocolate ice-cream soda.
Mm.
The The time you suspended me over the pit of crocodiles.
That was funny.
That was funny.
You remember the time you blinked me to the South Pole?
You happy now?
No, master.
I'm sorry I ever had a birthday.
Jeannie, have I ever lied to you?
Yes, master.
Yeah.
Well, I'm gonna make you a promise.
If you'll just hold on, I'm gonna find your birthday, your real birthday.
I will try, master.
Good girl.
You just pop back to your bottle, and I'll see you tonight.
Yes, master.
What's the matter?
I'm losing my power.
You mean, you can't get out of the office?
No.
Well, you can't stay here.
You're not government issue.
Oh, what should I do?
Huh?
Oh, here.
Get Get into, uh Get in here.
In here.
Right in here.
Come on, come on.
I will try, master.
Come on.
Come on.
Good afternoon, sergeant.
Are you feeling better?
Good.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Where are you?
Jeannie?
Here I am, master.
Are you all right, Jeannie?
I think so.
Good.
You just stay right there.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Dr. Bellows.
How are you?
Heh.
Dr. Bellows.
Is your desk all right?
Oh, yes, yes, fine.
Yeah.
Well, you know, a desk is a desk.
Yes.
Uh, I just came in to tell you that when you return from Alaska, you can have free access to ERIC again.
Oh, oh, that's wonderful, sir.
You'll be leaving in the morning, won't you?
Yes, yes.
They're painting my office, so, uh, while you're gone, if you don't mind, I'll be using this office.
Oh, good, good.
What are we going to do, master?
Well, we have to find out when your birthday is before Dr. Bellows moves in.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Roge.
Brought you a glass of milk and a donut.
A glass of milk and a donut?
What?
What for?
What for?
At a time like this, you gotta keep up your strength.
You're right.
Well, let's get going.
Get going?
Where are we going?
To see ERIC.
Wait a minute.
Look, I hate to sound like a pessimist, but this whole thing seems like a trap.
Well, it can't be helped, Roger.
ERIC's our only chance.
And besides, look at the kid.
She's She's really fading away.
Good luck, master.
Thank you, Jeannie.
And Jeannie Yes?
Whenever it is, happy birthday.
Oh Mm-ah.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
It must be nice to have someone give you a birthday party.
Well, you should know.
You must have had hundreds Thousands of 'em.
Oh, I have never had a birthday party, master.
You?
You've never had?
Well, how can that be, Jeannie?
I do not know when my birthday is.
I'm afraid there's no way to find out.
You You see, it all happened so long ago, that it's almost impossible Jeannie!
What are you doing?
Doing?
I hate to seem rude, but, uh one of your feet is missing.
It is happening.
TONY &  What's happening?
Whenever I get very unhappy, I begin to vanish.
What are you going to do, master?
Jeannie, you can't stay there.
Now, pull yourself together and go on home.
I have tried, master.
It is no use.
Oh, I have become so unhappy because I do not know when my birthday is, that I have lost my power.
Yeah, but  Sorry.
Is, uh, part of Jeannie still missing?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
You know what they say, half a genie is better than none at all.
That's what they say.
Yeah, Roger, we've gotta find out when her birthday is.
Well, back to ERIC.
Who is this ERIC?
ERIC is a computing machine, uh, Jeannie.
It's the greatest mechanical brain in the world.
A-and this machine knows when my birthday is?
Well, it will when we're through feeding it some information.
Oh!
Dr. Bellows.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Major Healey.
Yes, sir.
What do you have there, sir?
My files.
I'm ready to move in.
Did you say you're ready to move in now, sir?
Well, yes.
I'm gonna use your office while they're painting mine.
Oh, uh, do you really think you'd better?
Well, you'll be in Alaska.
Is there any reason why I shouldn't use your office?
Oh, no, no, of course not.
No, no.
Of course not.
You can use my office.
It has a nice southern exposure.
Yes.
The southern exposure here is just fine, thank you.
Let me clean out my desk for you.
I've got a few Don't bother.
I'll just, uh, move your things to one side.
Well Excuse me.
Oh, uh, do you have a pencil?
Oh, yes.
It's no bother, sir.
Oh.
Here we are.
That'll be all, gentlemen.
Oh, yes, of course, sir.
I'll just, uh, pick up some of my personal things.
Roge.
Gentlemen?
Sorry, sir.
Of course, sir.
Feel free to use any Anything in the office.
Feel free, sir.
Very free.
Why don't we go in my office and plan some strategy, okay?
Look, you can't let Dr. Bellows stay in your office.
He'll find Jeannie.
I know that.
I gotta get him out of there.
You know what you need?
What?
A genie.
Yeah Why don't we go over to the computer and find out Jeannie's birthday, huh?
I'm afraid you'll have to do it alone, Roge.
I gotta think of a way to keep Dr. Bellows busy.
Well, how?
I don't know how.
I'll think of something.
While you're thinking, why don't I have ERIC figure out Jeannie's birthday?
She'll get happy, her powers will come back and all of our troubles will be over.
You know how to work ERIC?
There's only one thing: We don't have enough information to feed it.
Well, it gave us the date before.
Yeah, but we don't know if the dates are correct.
What we need is more facts.
Facts?
Her own mother doesn't even remember her birthday.
How are we gonna come up with any information?
Ah, that's it.
That's it.
Astrology.
Astrology?
Astrology.
Astro I don't believe in astrology.
I don't even believe in genies.
But Jeannie believes in astrology.
Now, do you want to help her or don't you?
Of course.
I'd do anything in the world for her.
This is your only chance.
All right, all right, how could it help?
All right.
Different people were born in different months with different characteristics, right?
We have to find out Jeannie's characteristics, feed them to the machine, and we come up with her birthday.
That's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of.
I mean, even if I went along with you on this, where would we find a book on astrology at NASA?
Now, don't laugh.
Astrology For You.
Tony, it'll work.
Now, we know Jeannie was born in 64 B.C. Now, all we have to do is feed her characteristics to the machine.
And the fact that Neptune was in Scorpio when she was born, we'll come up with the whole thing.
All right, we'll do it.
And you know why?
Why?
Because I'm desperate.
I'm telling you, it'll work.
It's a cinch.
Now, all we have to do is program her personality.
How would you describe her?
What do you mean?
Nice, funny, happy?
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Uh, stubborn.
She's stubborn.
She's stubborn.
She's imprac I better write this down.
Yes, stubborn's good.
That's a good start.
Stubborn.
Stubborn.
Um impractical.

Now, she's impulsive.
Impulsive.
Warm-hearted.

Yeah.
Generous.
Very generous.
Generous, yes.
Very generous.
Sentimental.
Loyal.
Loyal's good.
Um, she's, uh friendly.
Friendly.
And beautiful.
Scratch beautiful.
Why?
I think she's beautiful.
Don't you?
To you, she may be beautiful, but not to ERIC.
Huh?
To him, beautiful is another machine that looks just like him.
Well, that oughta do it.
I'll get back to Dr. Bellows.
Yeah, you sure you can handle this, huh?
Yeah.
Can you?
Good luck.
Oh, hello, sir.
Is everything all right?
Well, shouldn't it be?
Yeah, oh, yes, of course.
Uh, do you find the office comfortable?
Oh, it's just fine, major.
Uh, was that all?
No, sir.
I'd like to speak to you, please.
Well, could it wait until a little later?
I I'm in the middle of a report that General Peterson's It's urgent, sir.
I feel it's really quite urgent.
Oh?
Sit down.
If you don't mind, I'd rather lie down.
What's your problem?
Well, it all started when I was a small boy.
"Impractical and irresponsible".
It sounds like a girlfriend of mine.
Let's see And then when I was 3 years old, I wanted a dog.
Oh, not just any kind of a dog.
No, not for me.
I I wanted a mongrel.
Uh, major Is that significant, doctor?
If you could just tell me what your problem is.
I'm getting there.
My father wouldn't buy me a dog.
So I stole one.
Major, General Peterson is waiting for this report.
If your dog can wait.
Oh, the dog can wait, I can't.
You see, when I walk down the street now and I see a dog, I have this terrible compulsion to kidnap it.
Kidnap it?
Oh, it's not just dogs.
It's chickens and sheep and goats and horses Just a moment.
Let me get my pad.
Now, uh, you were saying that you had this urge to kidnap horses?
"Mischievous and optimistic".
Ah, there, that should do it.
Now, ERIC, you've got to come through for us, ERIC.
I've never asked you to do any favors before.
Okay?
And so, in less than a year, I collected 33 dogs, And a milk cow.
That's the most amazing thing I've ever heard.
Um, where do you keep all these animals, major?
Oh, in In barns mostly.
Why, that's amazing.
Is it?
Oh, yeah.
We're really onto something.
Where you going, doctor?
Well, I'm going to start writing this up.
I haven't told you about the fish.
Fish?
Yes.
Fine machine you are.
You can't even figure out a date that happened 2000 years ago.
Jeannie was born Oh, oh, we did it.
We did it!
Oh, I'm so happy, I'll kiss you.
I sure hope you're a girl machine.
Well, that's what happened to me.
That's not so unusual, major.
And then it started talking to me.
You mean, it, uh, moved its mouth?
I mean it talked.
What did it say?
Well, it had this high, squeaky, little voice, and it said It said   Tony!
Major Healey.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
I'm busy, Major Healey.
Oh, sorry, just came in to wish someone a happy birthday.
Oh, you found somebody's birthday?
Certainly did.
Wonderful.
I'm just as sentimental as the next man, Major Healey, but I'm in the middle of a psychoanalysis.
Would you mind closing the door behind you as you leave?
Oh, I'm finished telling you about my dream, sir.
Your dream?
Yes, oh, didn't I tell you?
That was a dream I had last night.
You mean, you don't have a compulsion to steal animals?
Well, no, sir.
I mean, I love animals, but I certainly wouldn't go around stealing them.
Not Tony.
A dream?
Well, excuse me, stay right here.
Yes.
I'll be right back.
I did it!
I did it!
I'm proud of you.
Oh, ERIC and I are probably the smartest brains in the world.
Oh!
Hey, Jeannie, Jeannie, did you hear that?
We found your birthday.
Oh, yes, master.
I am so happy.
Oh!
Oh, master, look, look!
Oh, my feet are back, my feet are back.
Oh, I am so happy.
Oh, thank you, Major Healey, thank you.
Well, it's really nothing, Jeannie.
It's just, uh Are you sure there's no mistakes?
Mistake?
ERIC and I never make mistakes.
Give us the date.
This will kill you.
It was so obvious.
We should've thought about it in the first place.
When is my birthday, Major Healey?
All right, I'll give you a clue.
Uh, the month is in the title of a popular song.
Ugh!
Roge, there's a lot of months in the title of songs.
Yeah.
Okay, I'll give you another clue.
Uh, it's my favorite month of the year.
That's all very well, but I don't know your favorite month of the year.
Now, come on, stop horsing around and give us the date.
Well, look, I spent a lot of time looking for this.
I mean, I got a right to tell it to you slowly.
Ooh, Major Healey!
All right, I'll give you another clue.
My grandfather was born on the same day.
Roger, if you don't give us the date, your grandfather is gonna have a grandson that was murdered on this date.
I am dying to know.
Okay, boy, you're gonna love your birthday.
I wish I was born on this date.
What is it?
Uh, Jeannie's birthday is When is it?
What?
What?
Oh, uh, General Peterson.
Tony, you were scheduled to go on a survival mission to Alaska.
Yes, sir, I'll be ready in a few minutes.
I'm changing your orders.
What for, sir?
Dr. Bellows tells me you're in the middle of some therapy.
Therapy?
Oh, no, sir.
I was just telling him about a dream I had last night.
It's not just an ordinary dream, major.
That dream is gonna prove to be the key to your whole problem.
You'll be going in Tony's place.
Me?
A survival mission to Alaska?
That's right.
There's a B-57 waiting for you on the field.
You mean, we're leaving right away?
Right now!
Well, he can't leave right now, sir.
May I have a word with him alone?
There isn't time.
You're going to have a word with me, major.
Why don't we just lie down right where we can talk.
And we're going to start at the beginning.
Uh, remember the friend we were talking about, the information you had for him?
Yeah, well, just tell your friend Let's go, major.
We're on a tight schedule.
Sir I He can't leave now.
He better leave now!
As you were saying, you have no problem.
Oh, boy, do I have a problem.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, would you come out please?
I'd like to talk to you.
Ooh!
Look, I I know you're upset, but I want you to know it's not my fault.
You tricked me.
I do not believe Major Healey knows when my birthday is.
Now, tell the truth.
Now, listen, that'll be enough of that, young lady.
I'll tell you, I'm not gonna stand for any of this I should never have listened to you.
You lied to me.
Admit it.
Now, knock that off.
It isn't my fault Roger likes to play games.
Both you and Major Healey deceived me.
I I am going to leave here and find a new master.
Someone who will care about me.
Jeannie, please, would you stop just a minute and listen to me?
I wasn't lying to you.
We did find out when your birthday is.
Ah, then when is it?
Major Healey knows.
Now, now, please, he'll be back in two weeks.
I cannot wait two weeks!
Oh, I would like to turn Major Healey into a A mosquito and put him into a pond full of frogs.
You know, that's one of the best ideas you ever had.
Oh.
Don't be unhappy, Jeannie.
Just be patient, hm?
Oh, it is not easy, master.
I know.
Well, now, please don't do that again.
Please don't do that again.
I got something in my eye.
Huh, oh, let me see.
Now, look up.
All right, look down.
I am sorry if I was difficult, master.
Oh, that's all right.
I understand.
Here.
Hello, Tony Nelson here.
Hello, Tony?
Oh, hi, Roge.
You see, our problems are solved.
Oh!
I only got a minute.
We're going out on a mission.
Yeah, but Jeannie's pretty anxious about this, Roge.
Yeah, I can imagine.
It was funny what happened, wasn't it?
Ha, ha.
Roger, unless you're eager to become a mosquito in a pond of frogs, you better give me the date.
Is it a good month, master?
I don't know.
He hasn't told me yet.
Listen, Jeannie's gonna love her birthday.
Remember the clue?
I said the month was in a song title?
Ooh, when is my birthday, master?
When is my birthday?
He hasn't told me yet.
He's giving me clues.
Oh, hold on a minute, will ya?
Roger!
Roger!
Oh.
You still there?
Yeah, and it's my favorite month of the year.
Never mind all that.
Just tell me the date.
Well, here it is: Jeannie's birthday is Major, major, everything is ready, let's go.
Yeah, look, I gotta go now.
All right, I'll see you in a couple of weeks.
Roger List Roger.
He's done it again.
I don't believe it.
He's done it again.
Ooh!
Now, what are you gonna do?
I am going to blink Major Healey here.
Yeah, well, you can't do that.
Watch me, master.
No, I know you can, Jeannie, but you mustn't.
Now, he's on a very important mission.
You mustn't pull him off of it.
I want to know when I was born.
Well, he'll be back in two more weeks.
Two whole weeks.
Look, you haven't known what your birthday is for 2000 years, a few days is not gonna make that much difference.
Huh?
Please.
Very well, master.
Good girl.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna give you a birthday party.
But you do not know when my birthday is.
Well, it doesn't matter.
You can consider this one kind of a A pre-birthday party, hm?
Oh, that is a lovely idea.
When shall we have it?
Well, um, tonight.
Oh, it will be the first birthday party I have ever had.
Whom shall we invite?
Yeah, that kind of presents a problem, doesn't it?
Oh, what problem, master?
Well, for one thing, my friends don't know about you, so I can't ask them.
And you don't have any friends, so It'll just be the two of us.
Jeannie, we'll have a birthday cake, and we'll have presents and I guarantee you, it'll feel like a party.
Whatever you say, master.
Good, good.
Well, I gotta get going.
I'll be back about 6:00.
Oh, where are you going?
To think up some more dreams for Dr. Bellows.
Jeannie!
Oh, Jeannie!
Jeannie?
Good evening, master.
Oh.
Do you like my pre-birthday dress?
Oh, it's beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Leonardo da Vinci designed it.
Yeah.
Who else?
Oh, here.
Oh, master.
I am going to cry.
We got champagne, and we have caviar and we're gonna have the most beautiful party anybody ever had.
Oh, I am so excited.
Oh, and it was such a surprise.
How did you know that I wanted a birthday party?
Psychic, I guess.
Oh, you are the most wonderful master a genie ever had.
Well, I haven't had too much experience with this, Jeannie, but you're the most wonderful genie a master ever had.
Oh.
Here.
Oh.
Oh, oh, it is lovely.
Oh, master, thank you.
A little genie bottle.
Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
I wish we could have a lot of people at the party.
Would you?
Whee!
Oh, uh, uh, Jeannie, who are all these people?
Oh, these are just a few of my friends.
Oh, this is Major Nelson.
Thank you.
Benjamin Franklin.
How do you do, sir?
Cleopatra.
How do you do?
Have you seen Mark Anthony?
Well, not lately.
Excuse us, please.
This is Major Nelson, Marie Antoinette.
How do you do?
William Shakespeare.
How do you do, sir?
You remind me of my old friend, Yorick.
Alas, poor Yorick.
I knew him well.
Romeo and Juliet.
I I beg your pardon, sir.
That's Hamlet.
It was?
Oh, well, Hamlet, Romeo when you've written one, you've written them all.
Yes.
Henry, behave yourself.
Oh, that is perfectly normal behavior.
This is Major Nelson.
Uh, Sigmund Freud.
Oh, how do you do, sir?
And King Henry VIII.
How do you do, sir?
How do you do, lad?
Uh I hope you do not mind, master.
Mind?
Of course not.
This is wonderful.
Oh, then I do not have to send them away?
Oh, no, no, of course Oh, there is somebody I would like to see here.
Um, Jeannie?
Jeannie, don't leave me here with all these people.
Major Nelson?
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
How are you, sir?
I wasn't expecting you.
Aren't you, uh?
Benjamin Franklin.
Oh, yes.
Well Marie Antoinette.
And isn't this William Shakespeare?
Well, he's not really the real William Oh, and aren't you King Henry VIII?
Well, I Oh, Cleopatra.
You caught me.
Caught you?
Yes, sir.
You're looking at some of the greatest figures in history.
Oh, yes.
Sir, I knew this day was gonna come.
I might as well tell you everything.
Yes, and after you've told me, you think that I'm gonna rush back and tell General Peterson that you're entertaining Cleopatra, Shakespeare, and King Henry VIII?
Yes, well No, major.
I don't know why you have these guilt feelings about not inviting me to your costume party, but we'll settle that at our next little session, won't we?
Cos?
Costume party?
You know, uh, some of the costumes are, uh, quite effective.
Although I think you're overdoing the padding a bit, don't you?
Oh, uh, Mr. Shakespeare?
I've enjoyed your work.
Thank you.
And, uh, who are you supposed to be?
I am Dr. Sigmund Freud.
Oh, I am a psychiatrist too.
Hm, well, uh, enjoy your party, major.
Yes.
I'll see you in the morning.
Jeannie.
Je Is everything all right, master?
Nothing is all right.
Do you know how close I came to getting thrown out of the space program?
Oh, I am sorry, master.
You're sorry.
Listen, get rid of these people.
But you just said that Yeah, I know, but get rid of them.
Oh.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
All except Dr. Freud.
Um, oh, doctor?
May I see you for just a moment, sir?
Uh, you see, I have a little problem, and seeing you're here, I might as well use your talents.
I, uh I'm an astronaut.
And one day, I landed on this This Well, this deserted island, and I picked up a genie out of a bottle and ever since, I I haven't had a night's sleep  Good morning, master.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Did you sleep well, master?
Well, to tell you the truth, I was a little excited to sleep.
It's not every day a guy gets to chat with Cleopatra and Henry VIII and Sigmund Freud, huh?
It was a lovely party, was it not, master?
Well, that it was.
I can hardly wait for Major Healey to return, so that I can find out when my real birthday is.
Hm.
Oh!
It is so exciting to think that from now on, I am going to have a birthday just like everyone else.
Yeah, that's right.
Each year I am going to be a year older.
That's right.
A year older.
Oh, oh.
Master, look.
Hm?
Look, look, right there, right there.
There is a wrinkle.
Right No, no, there.
Oh, that's not a wrinkle.
That's not a wrinkle, Jeannie.
It certainly is a wrinkle.
That was not there yesterday.
I am getting old and wrinkled.
Oh, do you realize that every year I am going to be a year older?
Oh, if I had known that having a birthday was going to be like this, I would have never of allowed you to find out when my real birthday is.
Oh, this will make me so nervous, master.
This is terrible.
Why did you allow me to do this?
You are my master.
You were supposed to take care of me.
After all, I'm only a genie
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I wish Major Healey would return right this minute so I can find out when my birthday is.
But he will not be back until next week, so I suppose I shall just have to wait until then.
Florida Tech just scored a touchdown.
Master, it is such a beautiful day out.
Let us go for a drive.
Hey!
They just got the conversion.
How 'bout that, 14 to 13.
Sensational game.
Wow!
Oh.
Well, what'd you do that for?
Master, is football more important to you than I am?
Oh, of course not, Jeannie.
I mean, how can I compare you to football?
It's like trying to compare lemons and oranges.
And I am the lemon.
No, no.
Aren't you interested in football?
Oh, I am interested in you.
Master!
Hm?
Let us go on a beach picnic.
I will prepare a banquet for you.
All of your favorite dishes.
Yeah, well, tonight there's a football game on television I'd very much like to see.
I'll tell you what.
After the football season, I'll take you for that picnic.
You will not.
Why not?
Because then baseball season starts.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
Perhaps I should find a master who appreciates me more.
Mm?
Oh, you couldn't.
Oh, yes, I could.
In fact, I think I have met him already.
Oh, good.
Mm.
Yes.
I met him this morning when I went shopping at the, uh, supermarket.
Ah, good for you.
He is very handsome.
Good for him.
And tall and strong.
Mm-hm.
Yeah, wh-what's the name of this tall, strong stranger?
His name?
Mm-hm.
Uh, Tony.
Tony Millionaire.
Come on, you gotta do better than that?
You do not believe me?
Oh, Jeannie, I-I-I I'm just not the jealous type, that's all.
Eh, I wonder who that could be?
You'd think everybody else would be listening to the game.
Hi.
Is Jeannie here?
I'm Tony Millionaire.
Well, hello, lovely lady.
Hello.
Oh.
You dropped your gloves.
Oh, where did the lovely lady drop her gloves?
In the supermarket.
Here you are.
Oh, thank you.
My goodness, I feel just like Cinderella.
That was shoes.
Are you, uh, free tonight?
Oh, yes.
I was planning on going on a beach picnic, but it has been called off.
Major Nelson is very interested in football.
Oh?
As a player or as a spectator?
Oh, uh, just as a spectator.
That's nice.
I was fullback at Notre Dame for two years.
I left when I got a Rhodes scholarship.
I went to Oxford.
Oh, is that not exciting?
Yes, exciting.
Well, I'll see you at 7.
Oh, that would be lovely.
Uh, she's not going.
Oh, but why not?
Well, because nice young ladies don't go out with men who pick them up in supermarkets.
Isn't Jeannie over 21?
Boy, is she over 21.
Ye Well.
You're not married or anything?
No, no.
We're not married or anything.
Major Nelson is just like an uncle to me.
Well, Ah.
Well, good night, uncle.
Is he not everything I said he was, master?
And less.
You're not going out with him.
Oh, but why not?
Because he's Because he's got shifty eyes, and he's a hand-kisser.
How did he find you anyway?
Oh, I gave him my address.
You what?
Enjoy your football game, master.
I am so pleased that you are not the jealous type.
Hm, I think that I am in love.
Operator, I've gotta talk to Major Healey as soon as possible.
Yes, yes, as soon as you get him on the line, you call me back.
Thank you, thank you.
Ah, good morning, Major Nelson.
Oh, good morning, sir.
Oh, uh, am I disturbing you?
No, no.
I'm just working out some fuel-ratio formulas.
Oh, I never could understand these mathematical formulas.
May I?
Oh, sure.
Thank you.
At a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit, the inverse ratio proportion will be equal to twenty genies.
Twenty genies?
Uh, y-yes, that's s-slang for "gallons".
Oh I never heard of that before.
Hello.
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
Uh, all right, put the call through.
Oh, uh, personal?
It's, uh, long distance, sir.
Yes.
My mother.
Oh, I understand, major.
I'll see you later.
Thank you, sir.
Hi, buddy boy.
Buddy boy?
His mother?
Am I glad I got ahold of you.
You just caught me in time.
I'm just going on a field trip.
Hey, you know something?
These Eskimos really kiss with their noses.
Yeah.
Oh, my nose is so sore I can hardly touch it.
Ooh.
Listen, I met a girl.
Oh, did I meet a girl.
You can't believe Roger.
Oh, talk about cold noses, oh!
Roger, I need your help.
Need my help?
Is something wrong?
Yes.
I think Jeannie's fallen in love.
With someone else?
You're kidding.
She's crazy about you.
Well, she used to be.
But, well, you know how genies are.
Yeah, fickle.
No, no, she's not fickle.
It It's really not her fault.
This guy's enough to turn any girl's head.
He's handsome and athletic, and he seems to be reasonably intelligent.
Sounds like me.
Well, I think she's just infatuated with him right now, but if she sees any more of him, I could lose her.
Well, what are you gonna do?
Jeannie has a date with him.
I've gotta get her to break it.
That's where I need your help.
Well, Tony, I'm stuck here till next week.
All I need from you is some information, Roge.
You want me to tell you her birthday, huh?
Right.
You know how anxious she is about it.
I'm gonna tell her I have a big surprise for her.
I'll take her out to dinner tonight and spring it on her.
And she'll be so grateful, she'll forget all about this guy.
Ahh, you're still the same old master.
Ah-ha-ha.
All right, what day was she born on?
Oh, this'll really kill you, Tony.
Roger, just give me the date.
Remember I said the month was the title of a popular song?
Well, you know who wrote that song?
Just give me the date.
Okay.
Tony!
Yes, sir.
Engineering is asking for those new fuel ratios.
Haven't you finished yet?
Uh, no, sir.
I was just talking to Major Healey.
Oh, let me say hello to him.
Major?
General Peterson here.
Oh, good morning, sir.
How are things up in Alaska?
Oh, a little nippy, sir.
Any physical reactions?
Oh, yes, sir, I have a I have this very, very sore nose, sir.
I want all the tests finished by next Sunday.
Report to me when you've returned to Cape Kennedy.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, sir Well, Major Healey's on his way.
He's gonna take a five-day pack trip.
I hope he doesn't fall in any glaciers.
Tony.
Yes, sir.
Bring me the formula as soon as it's ready.
Yes, sir.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, I'm home.
Good evening, master.
Oh, hi.
Well, that's beautiful.
Thank you, master.
I'll tell you what.
I'll get changed, and we'll go out to dinner.
Oh, master.
I would not want you to miss your ball game.
There are some sandwiches for you in the kitchen.
I have a date.
Say, uh you really like this fellow, don't you?
Oh, yes, master.
He's wonderful.
Oh, but do not worry.
I will still be your genie.
I am grateful to you for having let me out of my bottle.
Oh, well, I don't want you to be grateful to me.
I thought you liked me, Jeannie.
Oh, I do.
Well, do you like me better than him?
Oh, well, that is a difficult question to answer.
It is like, uh Oh, like comparing lemons and oranges.
Oh, I am so excited.
A-are you sure that I look all right?
Oh, yes, yes.
Just wonderful.
Do my hands feel nice and soft?
They sure do.
Oh, I am using a very old perfume.
Does it smell nice?
It smells beautiful.
Good evening.
I am ready.
Oh, Jeannie.
You look like you're made of moonlight.
Oh, thank you.
Um Hi, major.
I want you to see that she gets home safely.
Oh, don't worry.
I have a black belt in karate.
Oh, uh, master?
Yes?
Would you do me a favor, please?
Sure.
Let me know how the ball game comes out.
It's 3:15 in the morning.
Oh, boy.
She knows as much about men as   Master?
Are you awake?
Oh, oh, is that you, Jeannie?
Oh, I am sorry to have awakened you, master.
I thought you might've been waiting up for me.
Mm, no.
No, why should I wait up for you?
I've been asleep for hours.
What time is it?
One o'clock.
It's 3:17 in the morning!
And what do you mean by staying out half the night with a man you don't even know?
Oh, I feel as though I've known him all my life, master.
Yeah, y-you do, huh?
That's exactly what he wants you to feel.
You know why?
Because he's a con artist.
He's a con artist, and he thinks that you're rich, and he's gonna take you for everything.
Do you really think so, master?
Oh, I've seen it a thousand times.
A thousand times.
On the outside he's great.
On in the inside he's rotten to the core.
Rotten!
I bet he didn't pay for dinner.
You are right.
I did not see him pay.
Yeah.
Yeah, see there!
Where'd you eat?
On his yacht.
On his yacht.
It is a hundred feet long.
He owns diamond mines.
See what he gave me.
What is this?
Some kind of a sample?
An engagement ring.
Yeah?
Good night, master.
Yacht.
Diamond.
Captain, listen, captain, you've got to reach Major Healey.
Yeah, I don't care where he is.
You gotta get ahold of him.
Yes, it's urgent.
Yeah.
Uh, right, operator.
Thank you very much.
Call me back soon.
Thank you.
Uh, mother?
Oh, yes, they're trying to locate her.
I've never met your mother, Major Nelson.
No, no, I don't think you have, sir.
Uh, what's she like?
Oh, just a typical homebody, you know.
Uh, she's not the type you'd call, uh, "buddy boy"?
Oh, no, no.
She's the sweetest, gentlest little old lady you ever met.
Hello.
Mother?
Mother?
This is your buddy, Roger.
Where are you, Mother?
Mother is up in a C-130.
I'm on a jump mission.
Uh, you know that information you have for me?
Well, I-I'd like it now.
It's kind of urgent.
Our friend just got engaged to be married.
You mean, Jeannie?
Oh, that's terrible.
Yeah.
We were talkin' about an old friend of the family.
Yeah.
Well, is there anything I can do?
Uh, yes, uh, you can give me the date.
Y-you're the only one who has it.
Oh, I get it.
She'll be grateful and forget about the other guy.
That's what I'm counting on, Mom.
If you want my advice, I'd forget about Jeannie.
No, I-I really don't.
Just give me the date.
Okay, okay, don't get excited.
I'm not.
I'm not.
Just give me the date.
Oh, I have, uh I have Doctor Bellows here.

She had to bail out.
She was at 900 feet.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
I miss you too.
Oh.
Oh, you must not say such things, darling.
Not over the telephone.
Oh, I do, I do.
I will see you later.
Goodbye, my precious pet.
Oh, good evening, master.
Hi, Jeannie.
Your dinner is almost ready.
Oh, forget about dinner.
I'm gonna take you out to a French restaurant tonight.
I thought maybe we'd have a 15-course meal, and then I might take you dancing.
Then we could have a long ride along the beach.
How?
How does that sound?
Oh, that sounds wonderful, master.
Good.
But I am going out with my fiancÃ© tonight.
Jeannie, you're not really serious about marrying this guy, are you?
You could forbid it.
You are still my master.
Well, I-I shouldn't have to forbid any You know, I thought that you and I had a Oh, yes, master.
Are you in love?
Oh, yes, master.
Heels over head.
What are you gonna do when he finds out you're a genie?
He knows that I am a genie.
He He knows you're a genie, and he still wants to marry you?
Of course.
He says that if you are really in love with someone, it does not matter if they are rich or poor, or ugly or pretty, or a genie or a girl.
Do you agree with that, master?
Sure, yeah.
Yeah, sure.
I am pleased to hear that.
I just don't wanna see you rush into anything, you know.
Why don't you have a nice, long engageme We are going to be married Saturday.
Satur This coming Saturday?
This Saturday?
He cannot wait to get married.
Is that not sweet?
Oh, yes.
Yeah, it's adorable.
He wanted a big church wedding, but I would much rather be married right here.
And you can give me away.
You would not mind, would you?
No, why should I mind?
I mean, if this is what you want.
Oh, believe me, master.
More than anything in the world I want to be married to the man I am in love with.
Well, I guess there's nothing else to say.
Will I ever see you again?
Oh, I hope so, but he He is so very jealous.
I do not know if he will allow it.
It's funny.
I always thought that you and I You always thought that wh-what, master?
Nothing.
No, nothing.
Oh.
Listen to your ball game, master.
I will go set the table.
Tony!
Oh, yes, sir.
Well, is anything wrong?
Oh, no.
No, why?
You've been acting a little restless lately.
Oh, oh, I've never been so relaxed in my whole life.
Well, I'm glad to hear it.
Oh, did you send a memo to the Ordinance Department this morning?
Yes, sir, I did.
They sent it back to me.
"Please modify the new blaster component to read: "One thousandth of an inch "instead of two thousandths of an inch, effective immediately".
Did you send that?
Yes, sir.
A-anything wrong?
It's signed, uh "I love you".
Oh, I-I'll rectify that.
Well, tell me, if you're having a problem with a girl, maybe I can give you a little advice.
No, I may be a little too late for advice, sir.
I think I've lost her.
Hm.
Do you love her?
I'm crazy about her.
Have you told her that?
Well, I think she knows.
Then you haven't told her.
Well, no, not exactly.
Son, when you're after an objective, the first rule in love or war is an all-out frontal attack.
Yeah?
If you really want her, go get her.
Go get her?
And don't write the Ordinance Department any more, uh love letters.
It doesn't look good.
Mm!
Whee!
Oh.
Oh, there's the paper.
Hold me tighter.
We're going to drive him crazy with jealousy.
He's not even real.
He's not even real.
Good evening.
Don't let me interrupt you.
Oh, I-I did not think you would be home so early, master.
Oh, don't mind me.
Carry on.
Carry on?
Well, I certainly hope you don't think Jeannie and I have been, uh You make a wonderful-looking couple.
You couldn't have picked a better man.
I could not have?
Well, he has just about everything.
Oh, you're gonna be happy.
Happy.
I can feel it in my bones.
Then you do not mind my getting married?
Mind?
Oh, I insist on it.
Oh, I love weddings.
But y-you can still order me not to marry him.
Why would I want to do that?
No, I-I'm looking forward to giving you away.
I haven't got time to read.
I got work to do.
Uh, why don't you two just take up where you left off, hm?
Uh Oh, you're gonna be happy.
Did you hear that?
Yes.
He does not care.
Well, I do.
Now, Jeannie I'm crazy about you.
You got me into this.
Hm.
Oh.
That poor kid.
Master.
Yes?
Could I speak with you?
Oh, and leave your fiancÃ© downstairs alone?
I I really don't think that'd be right, Jeannie.
Oh, well, this-that is what I wanted to speak with you about.
H-he is no longer my fiancÃ©.
Oh.
Oh, that's a That's a shame.
He seemed like such a nice chap.
I thought you did not like him?
Well, he grows on you.
I mean, uh What, a Rhodes scholar, a Fullback at, uh, Notre Dame, expert on karate Uh, he was almost Superman.
Master, there is something I must confess.
If you're gonna tell me that you conjured him up out of thin air, that he wasn't real, I already knew.
You knew it?
Of course I did.
Now, who do you think you're dealing with?
Do you really think I'd fall for an old gag like that?
You mean, you?
You?
You knew that I was trying to make you jealous, and you let me go on with it?
Yeah, I especially like the part where he wanted a big wedding, and you wanted me to give you away.
Ooh!
What would you've done if I let you go through with that wedding?
You'd be very much up in the air, young lady.
Get me down.
Come on!
Knock it off, will ya?
I can't get down from here!
Oh!
We got a first down.
ANNOUNCER : Ball at the 33-yard line  Master, it is such a lovely day out.
Why do we not go for a long drive.
A drive?
You wanna go for a long drive now?
Jeannie, it's in the fourth quarter.
The score is tied.
We have three minutes left to play.
See, Florida Tech is on Carolina's 48-yard line, and they're on the move.
This could easily be one of the greatest games ever played.
Master, enjoy your ball game.
I am going to go to the market to do some shopping for dinner.
Wait a minute, there's a pass coming up.
This could be the whole game right here.
Where are you going?
To the supermarket.
Supe I'm going with you.
Uh, just in case.
Ohh.
But what about your game?
Well, uh, could you?
Just until we come back?
Certainly, master.
Good.
Good.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Oh, good morning, master.
I am sorry.
I must have overslept.
Good morning, Jeannie.
You made breakfast all by yourself.
Oh, how clever of you.
Oh, help yourself.
Is there any mail for me?
Who would be writing to you?
Oh, Omar KhayyÃ¡m, Julius Caesar.
Oh.
No, I'm sorry.
It seems to be all for me.
Oh, here's a reminder about the television show tomorrow night.
What show is that, master?
Oh, uh, once a year the American Air Force bases all over the world put on a talent show.
They they pick a contestant from each base.
Oh, that sounds exciting.
Mm-hm.
Oh, they're gonna beam the show on Telstar.
They'll have, uh, someone broadcasting from Alaska and Hawaii and here at Cape Kennedy.
The winner gets a trophy.
Oh, good.
We will put it on the mantel.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna sit in the audience to applaud.
Oh, but you must be in the contest.
Well, what would I do?
Well, does it matter?
Well, yeah, a little.
Well, you can do anything.
Uh, no, no, Jeannie.
You can do anything, And don't.
Oh, but the mantel needs a trophy.
Well, blink one in.
I'm not gonna be in that contest.
I know you can sing.
Have you ever heard me sing?
Oh, yes.
You have a beautiful voice.
Oh, come on, Jeannie.
Sing something, master.
Oh, come on.
No, no.
Oh, please, please.
Sing something from the opera we saw last night.
What, Rigoletto?
Mm-hm.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Okay, why not.
Yeah, well, that's That's it.
Oh, that's beautiful, master.
Yeah?
Sing something else.
Uh Please.
All right, um, why don't I try a?
A light scale, hm?
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
La, la, la La, laaa Laaaa, laaaa, laaaaa  Did you see that?
Saw it, but I don't believe it.
Well, good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Major, uh, where did you learn to sing like that?
Oh, it's a It's a gift.
Oh, I've heard you sing before, but it didn't sound anything like this.
Well, you know what they say.
Practice makes perfect.
Uh, Major Nelson.
Do you mind letting me hear that voice again?
Uh, I'd really rather not, sir.
You see, the strain in the morning air Just a few notes.
If you don't mind, I'd, uh Why not.
La, la, la, la, la La, la, la, laaaaa Fantastic.
Yes, I think you might say that, sir.
Is there anything I can do for you?
Well, um, I had some forms for you to fill out, but, uh, with a voice like that, you mustn't waste your time.
I'll see you later, major.
Ahhhhh  Fantastic.
What am I doing?
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Oh, yes, master.
I'd like to speak to you.
Yes, master.
No.
No, what?
No, I'm not gonna be in that contest.
Oh, but you must.
How will I look if some other genie's master wins?
Well, I doubt if that'll ever come up.
Now, just forget about the contest.
If you say so, master.
Oh, no you don't.
Oh, no you don't.
You're gonna blink that voice away, or I won't forgive you.
I swear.
But it is such a lovely voice Ah, no, ah-ah, Jeannie.
No, I'm not kidding.
But No.
Plea Mm.
Very well, master.
I promise that you will not sing like Caruso again.
Wait.
Hm?
Goodbye All right.
And that makes you happier?
No, it just makes me feel a lot safer.
Usually, when you do these things, I get into a lot of trouble.
Luckily, this time there's There's been no trouble, and Well, if you promise not to do it again, we'll just forget about the whole thing.
Yes, master.
Oh.
Oh, master.
When will Major Healey return?
Uh, he oughta be back tomorrow.
Look at this.
Oh, good.
Then I will find out when my birthday is.
Yeah, I I've got to get back to the base.
Would you clean up all this glass and that stuff, huh?
Oh, certainly, master.
I'll see you later.
Mm.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
Caruso?
Tony Nelson's got a voice like Caruso?
That's right, general.
I heard it myself.
Now, that's hard to believe.
Well, general.
No one's more surprised than I am.
I don't know what happened, but as you know, I'm somewhat of an opera bug.
Yeah.
And I'm telling you, Major Nelson has one of the greatest voices I've ever heard.
And you think he oughta represent Cape Kennedy on that television show tomorrow night?
I've already entered him.
We can't lose.
Well, you oughta know.
Boy, I'd like to get that trophy.
It would look awful good.
Up on the mantel.
In the Officers' Club.
That's what I thought, general.
What did Tony say?
Oh, I haven't told him yet.
Oh, but he'll be thrilled.
After all, it's quite an honor to represent the space center.
Yeah Oh, I want to see his face when you tell him.
You entered me in what?
I knew you'd be pleased, Tony.
Oh, sir.
I can't sing, general.
I really I can't sing.
I admire your modesty, major, but in this case, believe me, it's misplaced.
You have a voice that even Caruso would have been proud of.
Yeah, he was.
Well, I mean You're gonna have to find somebody else to represent Cape Kennedy, sir.
Well, I don't understand.
I thought you'd be proud to be up there, giving your all.
Well, that's just it, it's not my all to give.
Major, you have the only voice I've ever heard that shatters glass.
He did that?
More than once.
I saw it.
It was an accident, sir.
Just an accident.
Uh, believe me, if I went out there, I'd be singing under false pretenses.
Why would you?
Well, I I don't have a trained voice, sir.
I don't have any control over it.
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
Tony, I have my heart set on this trophy.
Now, you're gonna go in and you're going to win, aren't ya?
Well, I  Uh The  I've had this cold coming on.
I feel it's gonna get worse.
We can't let that happen, can we, doctor?
Oh, no.
You go home and take care of it.
Oh, well, I I want you in good shape for tomorrow night.
Yes, sir, I'll I'll certainly try.
I I It's all right, thank you.
Oh, good, good.
Cold, good!
Master, your dinner is ready.
Do you want it?
What are you doing, master?
Committing suicide.
But you could catch your death of cold like that.
That's the idea.
Oh, well, you did not think I would let you catch cold, did you?
Jeannie, you don't understand.
I'm trying to catch cold.
Oh, I could not let you do that.
As long as I am your genie, you are going to remain in perfect health.
Oh.
Ow!
"And so, my fellow members of Congress, "I say that on this great and glorious Fourth of July, "we should commemorate the magnificent pioneer spirits "of those who blazed the trail for us, those who sent us on the march to victory" Master?
Hm?
Master, it is 3:00 in the morning.
What are you doing?
I I'm just reading a little.
Your voice sounds hoarse.
Does it?
Yeah, oh, no, I feel fine.
You go to bed.
You sure you feel all right?
I never felt better in my life.
"In 1776, when our brave forefathers took "this first magnificent step towards liberty "and went into battle, "it was because they heard the voices of the oppressed crying,  'Help.
'"  Help.
Help.
Help.
Jeannie.
Good morning, master.
Oh, good morning.
Did you sleep well?
No, as a matter of fact, I didn't.
I didn't close my eyes once last night.
Spent the whole night coming to a decision.
Oh What decision was that, master?
Well, I decided that since I can't get out of the contest, I might as well go in and win it.
That's nice.
Thank you, master.
As a matter of fact, I kind of enjoyed singing like Caruso.
Did you?
Mm-hm.
As a matter of fact, I think the trophy oughta go right here.
Oh, perhaps a nice vase would be better, master.
Who needs a vase when I have a trophy?
La, la, la, laaaaa Laaaaaa Oh, thank you.
Ahem.
Wouldn't they be surprised if I sang like that tonight, huh?
Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead?
Yeah, you know, uh, blink in Caruso.
No.
No, what?
No, master?
Jeannie, I want to sing like Caruso.
Thou canst not.
Who said I canst not?
You did.
Oh, remember?
You made me promise that you would never sing like Caruso again, or you would never forgive me.
Don't listen to what I told you, listen to what I'm telling ya.
Oh, I knew you were yelling at me.
Yelling at you?
This is a whisper compared to If you want me, I will be shopping Shopping?
Jeannie In Baghdad.
Don't do this to me.
Jeannie!
Now, come on!
Naaah!
Listen, you see Ahh, ahh, ahh.
Jeannie.
Naaaaaaa Oooaahh Ah!
What is it?
Oh, when'd you get back?
Couple of minutes ago.
Uh, what are you trying to do, anyway?
I'm trying to break that.
You can't break that?
No.
Would you like some help?
You think you could?
Thanks.
Forget it.
Hey, listen, uh, where's Jeannie?
I'd like to tell her about her birthday.
She went shopping.
Shopping!
Yeah.
Hey, look, why don't we get dressed up tonight and have a celebration, huh?
I'm sorry.
I'm busy tonight.
Oh, doing what?
I think you better sit down.
I don't wanna sit down.
I'm singing in the Air Force contest tonight.
You're singing in the That's right.
Why don't I sit down?
Mm-hmm.
You're sing?
You're singing in a contest with your voice?
No, originally it was somebody else's voice.
Now, you may find this hard to believe, but yesterday I sang a lot like Caruso.
Now or when he was living?
Oh, I'm serious.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
That's right.
Jeannie gave you Caruso's voice?
Well, maybe she changed it back again.
Why don't you sing something.
Ahem.
All right.
I'm desperate, Roger.
If I don't sing tonight, General Peterson and Dr. Bellows are gonna think I'm letting 'em down.
And if you do sing, you'll by lynched.
Do you realize about 30 million people are gonna be watching that show tonight?
They'll probably laugh themselves to death.
Thanks.
Thanks, Roge.
I needed a friend like you to come back from the Arctic and tell me really honest and straight.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, You don't have to sing tonight.
Oh, you don't have to sing.
I just solved your whole problem.
What?
Oh, catch cold.
Catch cold.
Catch cold.
All you have to do is take off your clothes, stand in front of an open window with the fan on you, put your feet in a tub of ice water!
I'm out of ice cubes.
I already tried it.
You're out of ice cubes and you didn't catch cold.
Jeannie wouldn't let me.
Wait a minute.
Oh, are you lucky to have me for a friend.
What?
Look at this.
Now, just read out loud at the top of your voice, and I guarantee you within one hour, your throat will be Cut.
You tried it?
Tony You got a problem.
Yes.
Oh, boy.
Why can't Jeannie make you sing like Caruso again?
Because one of the greatest minds of our time made her promise not to.
Well, what do you do now?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Do I?
Do I throw myself on the mercy of General Peterson, or do I jump in front of a truck?
Jump in front of a truck.
Seventy, 80, 90, 100.
I feel guilty about this.
I should really give you odds.
Come in.
Oh, I'm sorry Oh, Tony.
Come on in, Tony.
We were just talking about you.
Oh, uh, just talking about me, sir?
This is General Brill from Edwards Air Force Base.
This is Major Nelson.
Oh, how do you do, sir?
So this is "The Golden Thrush".
"The Golden Thrush".
Yeah, I was telling him about you.
As a matter of fact, I just bet $100 on it.
A hundred dollars?
Well, $100 is nothing You're right.
You want to make it 200?
You're on.
I was telling General Brill he's in for a big surprise tonight.
Yes.
You think we oughta give him a little sample, or, uh?
Shall we save our ammunition?
I think we oughta save our ammunition.
Right.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Yeah.
What?
What!
Well, if you tell them, if they're not able to do the job properly, they're not fit to be officers representing this command!
And I, personally, will see that they're transferred to duties elsewhere!
Ah, Tony, my boy.
That trophy's gonna look wonderful sitting up there on the mantel in the Officers' Club.
Or else you're gonna have a very unhappy general on your hands.
Yes.
Well, if you gentlemen will excuse me, please.
Off to rehearse?
Uh, no, sir, to find a truck.
I wonder why they didn't ask me to sing in that contest tonight?
I wish they had.
Oh, hi, uh, have you heard from Jeannie yet?
No, but I've heard from General Peterson.
Roge, we're gonna have an accident tonight.
Hey, I think you've had an accident already.
No, no.
I mean, we're gonna fake an accident.
We're gonna go up to the country club for dinner tonight, and on the way, we're gonna have a flat tire or, uh, bump a tree or Oh, I get it.
You don't have to show up at the broadcast, and nobody blames you.
Good thinking.
That's right.
There's only one thing.
What?
We'll use your car.
Oh, gentlemen.
Oh, hi.
I'm glad I caught you.
Caught us?
Caught us?
Uh, yes.
Have you made any plans for dinner this evening?
Well, yes, we're going out to the country club, sir.
Yeah, they have a lot of accidents on that road.
Oh, why don't we all have dinner together?
The three of us?
Yes.
Uh, no, no.
Roge.
Uh, yes.
Then we can go back to your house with you while you change, and then we'll escort you to the studio.
Oh.
We wouldn't want anything to happen to you tonight, would we, Major Nelson?
Shall we go?
Come on.
I'd just be in the way!
Now, Major Nelson, during the rehearsal, I want you to Major Nelson.
Yes Yes, sir.
Hey, look at all this, anyway.
I feel like I'm in show business.
Oh, uh, Mr. Hennessy.
Uh, just a moment.
Uh, this is Major Nelson.
How do you do?
And Major Healey.
Sir.
Uh, Mr. Hennessy will be your accompanist.
I was getting worried.
Well, I'm sorry we're late.
We had two flat tires and almost hit a tree.
Um, I'm afraid we aren't gonna have any time to rehearse, major.
You probably don't have my music anyway.
You told me he sang opera.
Well, I can play the arias from any opera ever written.
Wagner, Verdi, Bizet.
What would you like to sing?
Do you know "Melancholy Baby"?
"Melancholy Baby"?
Good old Tony, always kidding around.
Gentlemen, we only have a short amount of time.
Now, how 'bout doing "La donna Ã¨ mobile" from Rigoletto?
Rigoletto?
Yes, and what key do you sing at?
F.  F.  Or a C. F or C?
G. Uh, he has a fantastic range, Mr. Hennessy.

Poor Major Nelson.
How does he get himself into these things?

Huh?
Now!

"For the most versatile voice of the century".
And my birthday, huh?
You sang notes that haven't even been invented before.

He may have it.

Oh, but you must eat, Major Healey.
Well, I can pick up a sandwich over at the office.
Well, what about your date?

Well, it-it-it has been a long time.
You know, the funny thing, I was just saying to myself the other day, why don't I give old Sue a call.
Look, uh, if you're not doing anything tonight, I thought maybe the two of us could, uh It's Roger Healey.

General Peterson asked me to give these to you, Major Healey.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Evelyn?
Yes.
Uh, Evelyn, I was just thinking, uh Yes, major?
Tony and I are going on a double date tonight.
And I thought if you weren't doing anything, maybe the two of us could, uh I'm afraid my fiancÃ© wouldn't like it.
He's very jealous.
Jealous.
FiancÃ©.
Heh.
I didn't know you were engaged.
That's great, though.
That's great.
Well, maybe, uh, some other time.

Well, you haven't been out in weeks.
You're not dating anybody?
Am I?
Are you kidding me?
!
Ha-ha.
Am I dating anybody?
I'm dating dozens of girls.
Listen, they don't call me "Casanova" Healey for nothing, you know.
No girl in particular, huh?
Well, they're all particular.
That's why they go out with me.
You know how I am.
I play the field.
They just have to line up and wait their turn.

Jeannie, what are you doing here?
I am worried about Major Healey, master.
Wh Uh, Roger?
Why are you worried about him?
Is he going with us tonight?
Uh, no.
No, he's not.
I did not think so.
And I think I know why.
Hm?
Oh, yeah, well, he told us why.
He's, uh He's gotta work tonight.
I do not think that is the real reason.
Master.
I do not believe Major Healey can get a date.
What?
Old Casanova Healey?
He can get all the dates he wants.
Oh, I do not think so.
But would that not be a lovely idea?
What?
If Major Healey could get all the dates he wants.
If all women found him irresistible.
Yeah.
Yeah, I suppose it would.
Well I shall go home now, master.
I want to get dressed so that Major Healey and his date will think that I am beautiful.
Uh, Jeannie, I told you that, uh, Roger's not going out with us tonight.
Oh, I think so.
No, I don't think so  Roger Healey.
Mm-hm.

I've got someone on the other line.
Roger Healey.
Look, can you hold on, sir?
Marilyn?

Well, I-I-I thought you said you were busy.
Well, it's It's nice of you to break a date just for me.

It's the strangest thing.
It's as though I've never really looked at you before.
You're the most exciting man I have ever met.

Ha-ha.
Sh.

If I can wait that long.
Whoo!
Ohh!
I'm irresistible.
Oh!
Oh.
Eh, what have you done to Roger?
Every girl in town is after him.
I have made him irresistible.
What?
Roger?
Believe me, master.
No woman can keep from falling in love with him.
I saw it done once in a play from Aristophanes.
Oh, there was this man, and Yeah, uh, Jeannie, why did you do it to him?
Oh.
Because the reason Major Healey would not come with us tonight was because he was ashamed.
He could not get a date.
Oh.
So you changed all that?
Yes, master.
Are you not pleased?
You're right, Jeannie, I'm not pleased.
But, why?
Well, I don't know, really.
It's I do know that if you did this to him somehow, somewhere, it's got to lead to a disaster.
Oh, no, master.
Not this time.
This time you will see you were wrong.
I have made Major Healey the happiest man in the world.
And And no trouble will come from it.
Believe me.
No trouble.
Hm.
Hey, where did we get this, by the way?
Hmm?
Nice, nice.
If you look at the chart, you can see that after 10 minutes in the vacuum chamber, they, uh Well, the respiration rate starts to change.
Excuse me, sir.
Roger Healey.
Look, I told you not to call me at the office.
Look, I know it's hard to get along without me, but you'll just have to.

Oh, congratulate me?
What for?
On your wedding, Sunday.
I'm not getting married Sunday.
Yes, you are.
Ah-hah.
The boys and me are picking you up at your apartment at 10:00 sharp.
Be ready.
I hate to be nosy, but, uh, wh-who is it I'm marrying?
I ought to give it to you for that.
Well, if I offended you, heh Forget I asked.
Evelyn and me was gonna be married.
Evelyn?
But she's crazy about you.
What Evelyn wants, she gets.
Sunday, 10:00.
And if you're not there, you better be up in space, because that's the only place you're gonna be safe.
You astronauts.
You're doing a great job.
You think he meant it?
Yeah, I think we're doing a great job.
Oh, boy.
I better find out if there's a space shot Sunday.
Listen, are you really in love with this girl, Evelyn?
Whatever her name is?
Of course I'm in love with Evelyn.
I'm in love with all of them: Agnes, Ann, Georgia You can't be in love with all of them.
I don't know what it is.
It's like turning a hungry kid loose in a candy store.
Look, I can't get married.
There'll be a mass wave of suicides.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Yes, sir.
I wonder if I could speak to you a moment, Major Healey.
Oh, certainly, sir.
I don't, uh, quite know how to begin, major but, um Well, if it's about, um, Miss Mrs. Bellows, sir, why, I Yes, it's about Mrs. Bellows.
Well, I can assure you, sir, there's Oh, I'm not trying to pin the blame on anyone, major.
As a psychiatrist, I realize how complex these things can be.
Well, sir, it's not just Mrs. Bellows.
It seems that all the girls But, uh, because of my wife's infatuation, I find it, uh awkward for both of us to be here on the same base.
I agree with you, sir.
It's I think it best if one of us leaves.
Well, I'll miss you, sir.
I'm sorry So, uh, I'm having you transferred to the Aleutians.
The Aleutians?
Sir, I've been to the Aleutians.
I wouldn't send my worst enemy to the Aleutians.
I would.
You can plan on leaving in the morning.
I can't go to the Aleutians!
I'm getting married Sunday.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, I'd like to talk to you.
Oh.
Hello, master.
You're home early.
Yes, yes.
I have some news for you.
Oh.
Do you remember me telling you that, uh, somehow, somewhere, what you did to Roger would lead to a disaster?
Yes.
And you were wrong, were you not, master?
No, I were not.
The "somehow" is the mafia, and the "somewhere" is the Aleutians.
I do not understand.
Oh.
Well, you see, uh, Roger, on Sunday, is going to have to marry this gangster's girlfriend.
Only he's not gonna be able to be there, because Dr. Bellows is sending him to the Aleutian Islands.
Well, that is terrible.
Mm-hm.
How does Major Healey get himself into these things?
Jeannie, you've gotta help him.
I know.
I will fix it so that all women hate him.
Then there will be no reason for him to get married or be sent to the Aleutians.
No, you can't do that.
Mm-hm.
No, you Don't, really!
Why not?
Well, you can't destroy a man's ego.
Couldn't you just make it possible for him to be a little less lovable?
Oh.
Well, I I I do not know, master.
It may be too late.
Huh?
Excuse me.
Now, where are you?
Going.
Yeah Oh.
Jeannie?
Goodbye, Zelda.
Goodbye, Nancy.
Goodbye, girls.
Goodbye, office.
Roger.
Oh, Roger, I just heard.
Oh, take it easy, Mrs. Bellows.
We're on government property.
Can't bear the thought of your being sent away.
I'll go to the Aleutians with you.
You wouldn't like it.
There's igloos and polar bears.
I love igloos and polar bears.
Oh!
Oh, Mrs. Bellows.
You're You're just gonna have to be brave.
Just gotta hold on.
Oh.
So here you are.
Yes, I was just telling Mrs. Bellows that she and the other girls are gonna have to do without me.
And, uh, what do you say?
What do I say?
I say we've been getting along just fine without him all these years.
I think we can continue to do so.
You mean you don't mind if Major Healey leaves?
Mind?
Darling, why should I mind?
Couldn't care less whether he stays or goes.
What about the igloos and the polar bears?
Oh, dear.
Maybe you should keep him here.
Keep him under observation.
Well, under the circumstances, major, I don't see there's any point in your going to the Aleutians.
We'll consider that order cancelled.
Oh!
Thank you, sir.
Oh, thank you.
I get chilblain.
Shall we go, dear?
Yes.
Goodbye, major.
Bye.
Oh, doctor?
Oh, um Yes?
Uh, don't count on me for dinner tonight.
Oh!
Hello, girls.
Hello, girls.
Hello.
Ah!
Nancy, Nancy, Nancy.
And Zelda.
Oh!
Oh, darling.
Oh.
I heard you were leaving!
Oh, listen.
Don't panic, dear.
Don't panic.
I'm not leaving!
I'm staying.
About that marriage Sunday  Married?
Oh.
Me marry you?
Ha.
You're joking.
Uh I-I told you I was engaged.
You better pull yourself together, major.
Hi.
Roger Healey here.
Hi, Mary.
Uh, you remember Remember we had a date, uh, this coming June?
I had a few cancellations, and I thought that you'd like  Hello.
Jeannie, you did the one single thing I asked you not to do.
But the problem is solved.
No, it's not.
It's not solved at all.
It's worse than ever.
Do you know what it means not to be loved?
Well, yes.
But I fixed it Poor Roger must be shattered.
Oh, no, master.
Major Healey feels very loved.
How could he?
There's not a girl in the world who would speak to him.
Well, I   Tony!
Tony, open up!
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Oh.
Oh, Tony, help me.
Huh?
Why?
What's the matter?
They're after me!
Jeannie, I thought you said you fixed that!
Oh, I did.
I did, master.
Oh, don't open it up!
Okay, okay.
All right.
Oh.
Oh.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Jeannie?
Uh, Jeannie?
Good morning, master.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Oh I cannot imagine why I'm so sleepy.
I can.
You exhausted yourself making that dinner last night.
Ah, did you enjoy it?
It was one of the best meals I ever had in my life.
What was it?
We had caviar and champagne, Mm-hm.
Uh, duck a I'orange Mm-hm.
Pomme soufflÃ©.
Pomme soufflÃ©, that's right, and, uh, for desert, uh Crepes Suzette.
Crepes Suzette, oh, they were wonderful.
You know, it'd take me a month's salary to pay for a meal like that.
Ah Jeannie, before you came, my food bills used to be ridiculous.
Now, take the market bill I got this morning for example.
In the old days, it would have been Oh, I don't know, around 100 dollars, and now it's only $1047 and 63 One thousand dollars?
Oh, yes, master.
That is for the banquets you have been having all week.
But I-I thought you just, you know Well, sometimes.
But usually I just shop at the corner grocer where you have your charge account.
Well, there is a little Persian market I know of, but the meat there is very tough.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
About the Persian market?
Well, I didn't think you No, no, no, no, no.
I don't think you realize what you've done, Jeannie.
You see, Roger was gonna come over and pick me up, and we were gonna go down and buy a sailboat that we'd had our eyes on, but Well, now, I just can't afford it.
Well how much is the sailboat, master?
Well, it's 1000 dollars more than I've got.
Ha-ha-ha!
Hey!
Oh!
Anchors away!
Do you like it, master?
Oh, boy!
Fine friend you are.
You went out and bought the boat without me.
Why didn't you wait for me?
Huh?
What'd you say?
Jeannie, would you turn the wind off?
Thank you.
What'd you say, Roger?
I said, "You went out and bought the boat without me.
Why didn't you wait for me"?
Well, I didn't wait for you because this is not my boat.
You just brought this over on approval?
Yeah, well Would you get rid of it?
Oh, get rid of it?
G-get rid It's beautiful.
Would you like another color?
I'd like another boat.
What's the matter with this one?
Nothing, Roger, except it's not mine.
Ours.
Uh, Jeannie, you see, I I don't want anybody to give me a boat.
The fun of having something like this is Is working for it.
And saving for it.
And then buying it.
I know exactly what you mean, and that's a wonderful spirit.
Uh, I'll tell you what, Jeannie.
I'll I'll take the boat, but I'd like a few changes.
I thought we could have a swimming pool Would you get rid of it.
No, no  Oh, well.
I get seasick anyway.
Shall we go down and pick out our boat?
I can't.
You can't?
Wait a minute.
You said we were gonna go partners.
Sixteen hundred dollars a piece on a boat.
Yeah, I I know, Roger.
I don't have the money.
Well, what did you do with it?
I ate it.
Sometimes I think Bellows is right about you.
There you are, master.
What is it?
Oh, well, Jeannie.
No, no, no.
I don't think you understood what I was trying to say.
You see, I like to work for what I get.
Well, I'll just take that and be running along.
Well, easy come, easy go.
Oh, I just remembered!
I invited a lot of people to go sailing this weekend.
Well, I'm sorry, Roge, there's just nothing I Well, what's the matter with me?
I can borrow the money.
Where would you borrow the money, master?
At a bank.
That's what they're for.
Oh, no.
No, master, I cannot let you do that.
Why not?
Because!
If you do not repay the loan, they will cut off your ears.
Who told you that?
Earless Abdul.
Earless Abdul?
He did not become earless until he failed to repay a loan at the First National Bank of Pompeii.
Nothing's gonna happen.
Hm, that is what Earless said before he became earless.
Look, I'm going to the bank, I'm gonna get the loan, Roger and I will buy the sailboat, and then I'll pay the bank back in monthly installments.
I still do not like it.
Jeannie Look, I-I thought, before I leave, could I just see the boat once more?
Certainly.
Oh, well.
It's not my color anyway.
You, uh?
You coming?
No, I'll meet you at the base.
I'm gonna stop off at the bank on the way down.
Master?
May I go to the bank with you?
I have never seen a Cocoa Beach Bank.
Well, sure.
Sure, you can.
Well, look, I guess I better be running along.
I'll, uh I'll see you two later.
Look, do me a favor, will you?
Dr. Bellows.
Oh, forgive me for barging in, major, I That's a boat in your living room.
Yes.
Yes, that's exactly what it is, sir, a boat.
Uh, last week, there was a apple tree there.
Well, you know the old saying, "An apple a day keeps the doctor" Now, it's a boat.
Yeah.
I don't believe we've met.
Oh This is Pedro.
I been happy to meet you, Dr. Bellows.
Pedro?
Pedro Sven.
I didn't know you had a boat, major.
Yeah, well, it's not mine.
He's just showing it to me.
Yah.
It's just the right thing to the ocean.
I suppose you have some explanation for this boat being in your living room.
Yeah, well, it was too big for the bedroom.
It's going to be another one of those weeks, isn't it, major?
Sir?
Well, I was hoping that this week, you'd Oh, never mind.
One of these days, Major Nelson.
One of these days.
"Too big for the bedroom".
Sven, would you get the boat out now?
If you want me to, master.
Yah, I want you to.
I am ready for the Cocoa Beach Bank, master.
But is the Cocoa Beach Bank ready for you?
Yes, sir, can I help you?
I'd like to speak to somebody about taking out a loan.
Yes, Mr. Wilfred will take care of you.
If you'll just sit down a moment.
Thanks.
We'll be very happy to help you, madam.
Our greatest joy in life is seeing that wonderful look on people's faces when we give them loans.
Oh, thank you.
You see?
There's nothing to it.
Hm!
What is the purpose of this loan?
Well, you see, my husband died and left me without a penny.
A penniless widow.
Excuse me, but that's That's heartbreaking.
If I could borrow 70 dollars, I could buy a secondhand sewing machine and take in sewing.
That is the spirit that built this great country.
Here you are, madam.
Just make a list of your cash securities and real estate holdings.
But I haven't any.
That's right.
But I'll work my fingers to the bone to pay you back.
I have three young children to support.
Three young children.
Yes.
You see, what'd I tell ya?
I do not like him.
I'm sorry, madam, but I'm afraid you've mistaken us for the charitable institution.
We do not make loans without first-class security.
You mean you won't help me?
Now, I didn't say that, madam.
Of course we'll help you.
You see?
You come back here some other time when you have some property or blue chip securities.
I will be glad to arrange a loan.
He is exactly like the man who took care of Earless Abdul.
Next!
Well, what can I do for you this lovely day, general?
Uh, major.
Major.
I-I want to discuss taking out a loan.
That's what I'm here for.
You know my motto?
"Money can buy you happiness".
And I am here to make you happy.
What's this loan for?
I want to buy a boat.
Ah, the briny deep, the seven seas, Moby Dick and all that sort of thing.
How much is this boat?
It's $3200, but I'm buying it with a friend of mine, so it'll only be $1600 a piece.
Is that all?
Think of all the hours of pleasure you can have for $1600.
Well, I have thought about it, and that's the reason I wanna discuss taking out a loan.
I'm $1000 short.
A thousand dollars?
Yes.
Tell me, lieutenant Major.
Major?
Yeah.
How much real estate do you own?
None.
I have a house, but it's got a mortgage on it.
But you do have securities.
No.
No wonder you want a boat.
You want to escape from poverty.
Well, I do have a bank account here.
Well, why didn't you say so?
You're one of the family.
You know, I hate making loans to strangers, but I do love making loans to one of our big depositors.
Oh, I'm not a big depositor, I How much do you have in your accounts?
It's just one account.
A Christmas fund account.
Christmas fund account?
Yes.
Oh, I think I have about $600 in it.
Six hundred dollars?
And you want to borrow a thousand?
Let us go.
Jeannie, there's not gonna be any trouble with the loan.
But I can give you everything you need.
She's a very close friend.
Oh, don't apologize.
You'd be surprised how much of that goes on at Cocoa Beach.
Mr. Wilfred, I, um I do have a steady job.
So I see.
Your name?
Anthony Nelson.
Not the astronaut?
Yes, that's right.
Well, I don't know.
We've never made a loan to an astronaut before.
It would be very interesting trying to get our money back if you went up there and Excuse me a moment.
I think I'll check on your account.
I do not like that man, master.
He reminds me of the one who took care of Earless.
Don't worry, Jeannie.
All he can do is say no, and I'll just have to get along without the boat for a while.
I will be right back, master.
I am going to look around the bank a little.
Jeannie?
Mm?
Don't get into any trouble.
Of course not, master.
Well, Wilfred.
And how's it going?
Splendidly, Mr. Melnick.
I'm on my seventh turndown this morning.
This one's an astronaut.
He wants to borrow $1000.
And all he has in his Christmas fund account is $3,000,614.
Three million, six hundred and fourteen dollars?
And you're going to turn him down for a loan?
Certainly not, Mr. Melnick.
Give him anything he wants.
Yes, Mr. Melnick!
Yes, Mr. Melnick!
We mustn't let a man like that borrow only $1000, must we, Mr. Melnick?
Excuse me, sir.
Sorry to have kept you waiting, general.
Major.
Oh, you'll be a general.
I have a feeling in my bones.
Well, thank you.
Now, about the loan, if it's not too much trouble Trouble?
Why, it's an honor to do business with you, sir.
Suppose we just fill out this form for $100,000, payable at your convenience.
A hundred thousand No, no, no, I don't need $100,000 dollars, I just need $1000.
Take the hundred thousand, master.
"Master".
You don't see that kind of respect anymore, do you?
Really, $100,000 is too much.
I just need 1000.
Well, suppose you decide to buy a larger boat, or take on a few accessories.
A seaplane on board, perhaps?
No, no, really.
This is just a little sailboat.
Well, it could be a little bigger one, couldn't it, major general?
Let's make this out for $150,000.
Take it, master.
Let us go.
Well, what would I use for security?
Your face.
I knew it.
He wants your face.
That is worse than what happened to Earless.
Please, let us give you $200,000.
But I-I don't need $200,000.
Sir, if you're so anxious to loan money, why don't you loan money to the poor widow that was just in here?
Is that what you want?
Well, it'd be very nice.
How much shall we give her?
I don't know.
A thousand dollars?
A nice round figure.
She'll have the money this afternoon.
Now, just sign here, and we'll have the money sent over to you by special messenger.
Well, that's certainly very nice of you.
If we can ever be of any help to you, general, day or night, you just don't hesitate to call on us.
Let us go, master.
Thank you very much.
I-It was most pleasant.
I told ya I told ya it would be easy.
Sir, the second window.
Oh, Mr. Wilfred?
Yes, Mr. Melnick?
How much did Major Nelson borrow?
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. Melnick, but he only borrowed $1000.
I tried to get him to take $200,000, but he wouldn't accept it.
I can't understand it.
A man with $3,000,000 in his Christmas fund wanting to borrow $1000.
Uh, excuse me, gentlemen.
Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Mr. Wilfred.
Good morning.
Doctor.
Did you say that Major Anthony Nelson has $3,000,000 in his Christmas fund account?
Yes, indeed.
And he borrowed some money?
Well, just $1000.
Perhaps you could talk to him and persuade him to borrow more.
I'll talk to him, all right.
Thank you, Dr. Bellows.
It's going to be my pleasure.
Excuse me.
I got the loan without losing my ears, didn't I?
Hm.
Yes, master.
And I got the loan without your help.
Y-yes, master.
You know, I've been thinking of buying a new car.
Uh, maybe I'll negotiate another little loan.
I do not think I would do that if I were you, master.
Mm Hm?
I know how to handle these people much better than you do, really.
I think that's Roger.
Oh Oh, Jeannie, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Oh, I'm sorry, Major Healey.
Jeannie, next time you let him walk up the flight of stairs.
What happened at the bank?
Get your loan?
Oh, there's nothing to it.
They couldn't do enough for me.
Really?
I've been trying to borrow money there for two years.
Well, next time you go in, just mention, uh, that you're a friend of mine.
That's funny.
We make the same amount of money.
Boy, you must have something that I don't have.
Oh, Major Nelson is very good at handling people.
Yeah, hey, look, let's go over and pick out our boat, okay?
Do you know the loveliest boat I ever saw was Cleopatra's barge.
No kidding.
Really?
I'd love to have seen that.
Well, we better get going.
I'll see you tonight, Jeannie.
Okay.
And, uh, no blinking.
I'll walk down, okay?
Hey, here's a beauty.
Wow!
Look at that spinnaker.
Yeah, it's also $5000.
Roge, we've only got 3200.
I'm ready to go sailing, master.
Hi.
Hi.
We don't have the boat yet, Jeannie.
Say That's a cute outfit.
Yeah.
Do you like it?
Yeah.
Jeannie!
You look darling.
Major Nelson, I Well, I'll see you later, Tony.
Stay right where you are, Major Healey.
Major, what do you think you're dressed for?
Uh, this is, uh Well, it's for sailing, sir.
The sailing number in the Christmas show that Roger and I are rehearsing.
What show?
Oh, that show.
You talkin'.
You're rehearsing for a Christmas show in August?
Yeah, well, these things take time.
Hm.
Has anyone left you a large sum of money recently?
No, sir.
Good.
Major Nelson, I want you to wait right here, do you understand?
Right here.
Oh, quick thinking.
"What show"?
Oh, very good.
Jeannie!
Oh, nice work.
I am sorry, master, but in Greece, the warriors wore skirts, and in Scotland, the men wear kilts all the time Yeah, but this is Cocoa Beach, and Dr. Bellows, well, uh Why did he ask me if I'd been left a large sum of money?
He's wearing a sweater and a skirt and has $3,000,000 in his Christmas fund?
That's right, general.
Doctor, have you been analyzed recently?
Oh, general.
This time, Major Nelson won't get away with it.
His money is in the Cocoa Beach City Bank, and he's in his office.
Dr. Bellows, if this is another one of your wild hallucinations, you're going through psychoanalysis again.
Gladly.
That's good.
Hm.
While we were at the bank, you didn't do anything, did you?
Do what?
Well, if I knew, I wouldn't be asking you.
Why would anybody wanna lend me $200,000?
You mean they wanted to lend you $200,000, and you didn't accept it?
Jeannie, what did you do at the bank?
I-if I tell you, you will not be angry with me?
Me, angry?
Me?
Why would I get angry?
I've never seen a girl Who are you talking to, Major Nelson?
Oh, uh, we were just rehearsing, sir.
You know, the Christmas play?
You You've got the next line, Roge.
My line next?
Oh, goodbye.
Just a moment, major.
You said he was in a skirt and sweater.
Well, obviously he changed clothes, general.
I can't wait to hear him explain away the money in his account.
Oh, oh, is that all?
Is that all you're worried about?
Well?
Oh, yes.
Well, I started the account last January, and every week I stick a certain amount of money in there, and it all adds up, you know.
To $3,000,614?
Three million, six hundred  And this time you can't blame it on any Christmas play.
The money is in the bank, and it's yours.
Now, would you like to explain it now?
Or at your court-martial, major?
Well, I I can't explain it, sir.
I don't have $3,000,000.
The bank says you do.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
We'll all go down there right now.
After you, major.
I have done it to him again.
Wilfred?
Yes, Mr. Melnick?
This is Mr. Peterfy, the federal auditor.
How do you do, Mr. Peterfy?
Mr. Peterfy wants to ask you a question.
Always delighted to answer questions.
Mr. Melnick tells us that you said that one of your savings club depositors had an account containing $3,000,000.
Yes, Major Nelson.
I made him a loan this morning, personally.
Mr. Wilfred, if Major Nelson has $3,000,000 in his account, this bank is $3,000,000 short.
Three million dollars short?
That is correct.
We've tracked it down to your department.
I'm sure you don't think that I-I-I I mean to say, you don't suspect that I But I didn't take it.
That money is in Major Nelson's Christmas account.
Here it is.
Six hundred and fourteen dollars.
What?
B-but I saw it here myself.
With management like this, I think I shall have to audit your books from top to bottom.
A three million dollar mistake.
That must be a new world's record.
There's Mr. Wilfred.
He'll tell you.
Oh, Mr. Wilfred?
This is General Peterson.
And you know Major Nelson.
I certainly do.
Mr. Wilfred, I want to talk to you about Major Nelson's Christmas account.
Do you really?
Will you please tell the general how much Major Nelson has in that account?
I'd be delighted.
He's got $614.
That's a mistake.
I'm talking about Major Nelson's account.
I don't know what you're trying to pull, Dr. Bellows.
But swindling a bank is a federal offense.
Me?
Swindler?
You told me he had $3,000,000.
Yeah, well, he hasn't.
And about that loan, major, you better come up with some security.
This isn't the Salvation Army, you know.
Doctor.
No, sir.
This time I'm not going to back down.
Somewhere in this bank is $3,000,000 belonging to Major Nelson, and I demand to know where he got it.
Doctor, I think I found that $3,000,000.
Good.
I knew it.
Let me have it as evidence.
May I see that, sir?
Well, Dr. Bellows, this is your card.
Mine?
That's impossible.
I can start my analysis in the morning.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie, it's all right, you can come out.
Are you sure you are not angry with me, master?
Millionaires don't get angry, Jeannie.
I'm sorry about that.
But I was only trying to be helpful.
Trying to be helpful.
Yeah, I know.
Yes, master.
I must say, it was kind of fun thinking I had $3,000,000 in the bank.
That's all right, I'm perfectly happy with things the way they are.
Yes, master.
Hi.
Well, how's my friend, the millionaire?
I'm fine, Roge.
Hey, did you hear what happened to poor Dr. Bellows?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, at least one nice thing came out of this.
That poor widow will be able to buy a sewing machine now.
Oh, I do not think she's going to need one, master.
Why not?
I believe she has a beautiful, little dress shop of her own.
Oh, that's wonderful, Jeannie.
You can buy all your clothes there.
That's funny.
Oh, you're funny.
I kind of like you in skirts.
Are we gonna buy the boat, or aren't we?
We're gonna have to wait.
I had to give the loan back to the bank.
That is terrible.
I will take that bank and tear it apart!
No, don't do anything.
They're in business to make money.
That's their business.
I doubt if Mr. Wilfred has ever been at sea.
He looks like he's never been out of the bank before.
Boy, if he could feel the rolling deck of a ship beneath his feet and feel the wind and the spray on his face, he'd maybe know what he was missing.
I do not think he is ready for that yet, master.
Maybe we ought to start him off on a raft.
TONY &  Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Get us off!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hi, Tony.
Guess what I just bought.
A new bowling bag.
Very funny.
So are you going bowling with us tonight?
Oh, I can't, Roger.
Jeannie expects me to be with her every minute.
She's got a list of things for me to do as long as you're arm.
She wants to go to the movies and plays and the museums and picnics.
I That sounds like fun.
Yeah, well, it would be fun if I had time for it, but, well, I'm I'm scheduled to do the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle next month.
Hm.
You know what you should do?
What?
You should get her a hobby.
That would solve all your problems.
Can you imagine Jeannie with a hobby?
Hey, wait a minute.
That's not a bad id You're brilliant.
Yeah, something that'll keep her busy 24 hours a day.
Well, I could, uh Good morning, master.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Good morning.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Uh, listen, uh, Tony was just telling me he's going to try to get you to take up some kind of a hobby Roger.
Roge Oh, a hobby?
Have you ever thought of studying, uh, oh designing or sculpture?
Oh, no.
I would not be interested.
Um, uh, dancing?
Uh Karate?
Roge.
Isn't there anything that interests you?
Oh, yes, master.
I am interested in all those things.
But, if I studied any of them, I would not be able to spend all my time with you.
Nice try.
Nice try.
Are you ready to go to the art exhibit?
No.
No, I'm not going to the art exhi I've told you three times, I can't go.
Oh, but you must.
No, I mustn't.
Now, you've gotta realize that when I say no, I mean no.
Right.
He has a will of iron.
Yeah.
Yeah, a will of iron, hah.
Jeannie, what?
Welcome to the art exhibit, master.
Yeah.
Oh, look, master.
Oh, it is an original Aunt Sarah.
Yeah.
Mom, I'm tired.
I wanna go.
Shut up and stop whining.
You're gonna have culture if it kills ya.
I cannot stand to hear people treat children like that.
Neither can I. My feet hurt.
Can't we go home?
Do you wanna be ignorant, like your father?
Ooh!
Jeannie, don't get into this.
Jeannie.
Mom?
Jeannie, come on, come on.
Harold.
Jeannie, why did you turn that boy's mother into a goose?
Because she was a goose, master.
I could not stand to see the way she treated him.
There is a very special way to treat children.
Yeah, I'm sure there is, but turning a mother into a goose I know everything about children.
Someday, I am going to write a book about it.
Yeah, you do that.
It would be the best book in the whole world.
Do?
Do you really think you could write a book about bringing up kids?
Of course, master.
How long do you think it'd take?
Oh, I do not know.
Maybe, hm, three or four weeks.
Three or four weeks, huh?
You wouldn't be able to do anything else.
I mean, you'd have to concentrate on it.
Oh, I would not mind, master.
Hm.
Do you really think I should do it?
Oh, yeah, I I do, I I really do.
Very well, master, I shall.
I am afraid you will not be seeing much of me for a while, master.
We all have to make sacrifices, Jeannie.
Now, take your time.
And don't rush it.
Oh, do not worry, master.
It will be a good book.
You will like it.
I already like it.
Aw.
Master.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
How's the book?
It is finished, master.
How to Be a Fantastic Parent.
Do you like the title, master?
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
What about How to Be a Fantastic Mother?
Oh, that is a splendid idea.
You like it?
Mm.
I do not think I should put my name on it.
Do you?
No.
No, I don't think so.
How about?
Why don't you try Anonymous?
Who is Anonymous?
Well, you can use any name you want to.
Uh, I've gotta get to the office.
I'm a little late.
I'll see you later, huh?
Oh, very well, and And thank you, master.
For what?
Your splendid title.
Oh, thank you too.
For what, master?
Uh, three weeks' training on the LLRV.
Oh.
LLRV?
Now who shall publish my book?
Let's see.
Ah, "Woodhouse Publishing Company, New York City, New York".
I will let them publish my book.
Anonymous.
Aww, that is better.
"Major Anthony Nelson".
Yeah, but Sam Marcus is one of the best astronauts in the program.
They really haul him on the carpet?
That poor devil.
It's from the publisher.
Well, let that be a lesson to all of us.
I am sure sorry for him, Roger, but  Oh, they have accepted my master's book.
Oh.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, all we can do in the future is just be more careful.
Yeah.
I'll I'll see you down at the center.
Well, that's a shame.
Wha?
What is a shame, master?
Oh, one of our best astronauts, Sam Marcus, just got himself in a lot of trouble.
How?
He wrote a magazine article, didn't clear it.
And that got him into trouble, master?
Hm?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Every time that an astronaut writes anything he's gotta clear it through NASA.
He does?
Yeah, well, sure.
Oh, is?
Did you get the mail?
Mm-hm.
It's just advertising.
I better get down to the office.
I wanna see how poor old Sam is gonna make out.
I'll see you tonight.
Yes, master.
Oh, well, who will know?
No one will read the book, anyway.
It's all set to go, major.
Oh, thanks.
Well, good luck, Tony, and, look, do a good job, huh?
When we use this flying mattress to scoot along the surface of the moon, we don't want anything to go wrong.
Huh?
I said, when we, uh N-nev Never mind.
Never mind.
Good luck.
Good luck.
That's what I said.
Hey, it worked.
It worked.
Look at him go.
Is that Major Nelson up there?
Yes, sir.
Hi.
It has a perfect checkout.
Couldn't have handled better.
That's great, major.
Oh, major, there are some reporters in my office to see you.
Thank you.
Sir?
There are some reporters in my office to see you.
Oh, they probably heard about the test.
Shall we go?
Uh, pardon me?
Shall we go?
Oh, yes, yes.
Here.
Ladies and gentlemen, this is Major Nelson.
How do you do?
I understand you all wanna ask me some questions?
Would you explain your theory about breast-feeding?
In chapter three in your book, you said that How do you feel about getting a National Baby Award from the Mothers' Organization of America?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I-I don't understand what you are all talking about.
They're talking about your book, major.
How to Be a Fantastic Mother.
My book?
Mm-hm.
Well, I I never wrote a Wrote a better book in my life.
How does it feel to be the new Dr. Spock, major?
I'd like to know something more about your theory on feeding too.
I read that It's amazing how, for one hour and a half, you managed to say absolutely nothing.
You're, um, a bachelor, aren't you, major?
Yes, yes.
Well, I'm a psychiatrist, and I'm staking my reputation that this book was not written by a bachelor.
Doctor, believe me, it came off my typewriter.
I'm going to give you a chance to prove it.
Yea Uh, prove it?
Pro?
How, sir?
Hm.
Do you remember what you said in, uh, chapter 13?
Chapter?
Chapter 13?
Well, no, uh, not Not word for word.
Uh, you said that in one evening, you could take the most incorrigible child in the world and change him into a loving human being.
Uh, did?
Did I say that?
I mean That was in chapter 13.
Yes, major.
And I happen to have the most incorrigible child in the world.
Uh, that is, he belongs to my sister.
He's 12 years old.
He's already gone through three analysts, of which I was one.
Well, it sounds like, uh, quite a challenge, sir.
However, I'm afraid I'm not gonna have time to work with him.
One evening.
Yes, sir?
You said you could do it in one evening.
He'll be at your house tonight, major.
Oh, uh, tonight?
Ahem.
Tonight's it's impossible, sir.
I have to work on the LLRV And we're going to have another press conference.
Where I will tell the reporters how successful you've been, or you can explain that this book is a fraud, and that you didn't write it.
I needn't remind you how NASA feels about astronauts getting phony publicity, need I, major?
No, no.
You're excused.
Thank you.
Remember Sam Marcus?
Oh, Mother Nelson, I, uh, just read your book, and I  Ni Nice reading.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, I'd like to talk to you.
Good evening, master.
Oh, hello.
Say, uh, how'd my name get on that book?
The publisher made a mistake.
No, no, you did.
And you know what it's gonna cost me?
My job.
Oh, but why, master?
Just because you are an expert on children No, I'm not an expert on children, and Dr. Bellows knows that.
Oh, he cannot prove it.
Oh, yes, he can.
He's bringing his nephew over here tonight, and from what I'm led to believe, his nephew is the youngest juvenile delinquent on record.
And if I don't make that kid into a bundle of love before the evening is out, I'm finished.
Finished.
Over.
Finished.
Oh, well, that is easy, master.
I will show you the chapter You'll do nothing.
Oh, but, master You leave that kid alone.
If that is what you wish.
That's what I wish.
Oh!
How do you get yourself into these things?
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Good evening, Major Nelson.
This is my nephew, Richard.
Oh, hello, Richard.
Uh, you look like a fine young man.
You an astronaut?
Uh, yes, yes.
You wanna be an astronaut when you grow up?
You think I'm some kind of a creep?
Uh, tell him what you're going to do when you grow up, Richard.
I'm gonna join the Mafia.
Um Has anybody ever given him a spanking?
Lots of times, but nobody ever spanks me more than once.
Oh, is that right?
Oh, yes.
Uh, tell him why, Richard.
'Cause every time somebody spanks me, I set fire to somethin'.
You wanna try it?
Uh, no, no, no.
Uh, well, I'll, uh, just run along and leave you two to each other.
No, no, you're not gonna You have three hours, major.
You're not gonna leave him him?
Doctor?
Uh Say, uh, uh  There, Richard, I spent a lot of time on that.
Hey, you know, I think we can work out our problems by talking and getting to understand each other, huh?
You seem like a pretty bright fella.
My uncle, the head shrinker, says if you don't straighten me out tonight, you're in a bunch of trouble.
He say that, huh?
Yeah, and you know somethin'?
What?
You're in a bunch of trouble.
Got anything to eat around here?
Yeah Oh, sure, sure.
We got cookies and milk Hold this.
Oh, General Peterson.
Tony, forgive me for barging in on you like this.
That's quite all right, sir.
What can I do for you?
Why, it's about that book you wrote.
Book?
Congratulations.
I had no idea that you that you knew so much about raising children.
It's Uh, I really don't know that much about it, sir.
I It's just an instinctive thing, I suppose.
Well, now, don't be modest.
When a book like that gets to be a bestseller, there's gotta be a good reason for it.
Well, uh, I suppose there is, sir.
Uh, thank you for dropping by to congratulate me on it.
Well, I didn't come by just for that, Tony.
I Well, I have a little granddaughter, 11 years old.
Uh, she's a nice girl, but she's terribly shy, and because of that, she's withdrawn in a kind of a protective shell.
It's It's ruining her life.
We can't even get her to talk anymore.
Oh, if you help us, Tony, I certainly would appreciate it.
Well, I I I'd like to try, sir, but I I'm really not qualified Dr. Bellows doesn't even believe that you wrote it.
This time we're really gonna teach him a lesson, aren't we?
Yeah.
Gina.
Oh Gina.

Uh, this is Major Nelson.
How do you do, Gina?
Uh, Gina's gonna have a birthday party next week aren't you, Gina?
Now Now, you stay here You stay here with Major Nelson.
Oh, wait till Dr. Bellows hears about this, heh.
I'll see you in about three hours.

So are you gonna spank me?
Uh, give me those things.
Listen, you shouldn't be H-h-how'd you like to, uh?
To play with a pretty little girl, huh?
Where is she?
No, I guess that's not such a good idea, after all.
I want you to clean this place Would you stop that?
I want you to clean this place up, understand?
I'll be back in about two minutes.
Master.
Oh.
What is it?
Is he not a darling boy?
A darling boy?
That kid wants to join the Mafia.
You know what?
I don't think they'll take him.
Master, he is not that bad.
Do you know what I would do with him?
No, but I know what I'd do with him.
That's against the law.
I've got a kid upstairs I can't make talk, and I got a kid in the kitchen that I can't turn my back on.
Now I gotta keep 'em apart.
Oh.
Hi there.
I brought you something.
How would you like some cookies and milk, huh?
Oh, say, you're not afraid of me, are you, Gina?
Yeah, come on, you're You're too pretty to be shy.
Anybody ever tell you that?
You're a beautiful young girl.
Uh, do you have any brothers or sisters?
Hey, I bet you had You don't have anybody to talk to, do you?
Gina, um How would you like to play with a rocket?
Or a?
A?
A globe?
I I bet you've never seen one like this?
It's a real antique.
How about this telescope?
I can show you, through this telescope, the Sea of Tranquility.
It's on the moon.
I'm gonna be landing there one of these days.
Look, Gina I'm just trying to help.
Oh.
Look.
Say, look here.
Here's a doll.
Her name is Heh.
It's Jeannie.
You You You wait right here.
I'll I'll be back.
What's going on around here, huh?
It took me three weeks to make that.
Back to the old drawing board.
Richard.
Come here.
You know, Richard, you shouldn't touch something that belongs to somebody else.
Now, I'll tell you what.
I've got the makings for a new plane out in the patio.
Now, why don't you go out there and build it, hm?
That's kids' stuff.
Oh, no, it isn't.
It takes quite a bit of intelligence to build one.
My IQ is 170.
What's yours?
Forget it.
Well, how are we getting along, Gina?
Feeling any better, huh?
Wh?
What did we talk about, hm?
Uh, look, darling, I I don't know how to explain this, but we don't have a lot of time.
You see, I've gotta get you talking before your grandfather comes back to pick you up.
You're a very sweet young girl, and I And I'm sure you have a lot to say.
All you need is a little sympathetic understanding.
And believe me, I'm a sympathetic guy.
Ju Just Just talk to me.
Just say the first thing that comes into your mind.
I smell smoke.
You see?
You see how easy that was?
Three little words: I smell smoke.
Wonderful.
Yee Oh Well, oh Master.
Oh.
Later.
You think I'm gonna fall for an old gag like that, huh?
What do you think you're doin'?
I was making some rocket fuel.
Yeah?
Well, stay away from the stove.
And And clean this mess up.
And fix that plane!
Master.
Oh.
If you would read chapter 17, it says here Cha?
Read?
I don't have time to read.
My whole life is going down the drain.
But What?
No.
Well, have you thought of any games for us to play, huh?
Huh?
What's the matter, Gina?
I want to go home.
Oh.
That's Dr. Bellows.
I You just You just stay right here, honey.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I'm back.
Has it been three hours already?
Why, yes, it has.
Yeah, it's amazing how time will pass when you're having fun.
Have you been having fun?
A ball.
A ba Richard's a wonderful kid.
A really wonderful kid.
Uh, Richard?
Sure, oh, yes, yes, yes.
It's All he needs is a little understanding.
It's amazing how much fun you can have when you understand each other.
We've been having such a good time, I was wondering if he can spend the night.
I could bring him over in the morning Major Nelson.
We could Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
Where is he?
Who?
Uh, oh, Richard.
I'm sorry.
Yes, he's Well, he's out on the patio assembling some model airplanes we've been working on.
He didn't smash them?
Mm, well, there were a couple of little accidents.
Nothing important.
Uh, yes.
Uh, may I see him now?
Uh, well, I'd rather you didn't Uh, now, major.
Yeah.
Gentlemen.
Ah, good evening, general.
Yes, yes, general.
How are you, sir?
Good evening.
How is Gina?
Gina?
Oh, wonderful.
Wonderful kid.
Just a charming girl.
Aren't you proud of him, doctor?
I will be as soon as I see my nephew changed into a well-behaved little boy.
Richard?
Uh, doctor Uh, general You don't have to say a word, major.
The evidence will speak for itself.
Intelligent to make a model as beautiful as that.
I didn't make it.
I just fixed it.
Most girls would think that's kids' stuff.
Oh, no, I think it's wonderful.
You do?
Really?
I'm making a rocket at home.
I don't believe it.
Gina's talking.
Come over and see it sometime.
I certainly owe you an apology, Major Nelson.
How in the world did you ever do it?
Chapter 13.
May I see you to your car?
Mm-hm.
Amazing.
How'd you say you did that?
Yeah, read the book, sir.
Oh, I did, I did.
It all seemed so terribly simple in school.
Good night, major.
Oh, good night, sir.
And thanks  Oh, yeah.
I-I-I hope you're happy, master.
Oh, thank you, Jeannie.
Thank you very much.
There's only one problem.
Well, what is that, master?
If you used magic on those children Oh, but I did not.
I did not.
All I did was bring them together.
Yeah, and then what happened?
Oh, you must read the last chapter, master.
It is about boys and girls.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Is there any more coffee, Jeannie?
Oh, thank you.
Master.
Hm?
Why do you not work at home today?
Is this not much nicer than a stuffy, old office?
No, it's not a stuffy, old office.
Besides, Roger's gonna be picking me up in a few minutes.
We have a conference with General Peterson.
And I'm taking up a 104 with some experimental equipment on it.
Now, that's not stuffy.
And you find that exciting?
It's not supposed to be exciting.
Well, then why do you do it?
'Cause I like it.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Oh, hi, Roge.
Come on out.
Roge?
What's wrong?
Look, uh, we'd better get over to the office.
We have a meeting in, uh, Well, you got time for a cup of coffee.
Very nice.
Sit down.
Tell me what's worrying you.
Oh, what could be worrying me when I have a friend like you?
Have you had any other nice wishes today?
What's on your mind?
There's nothing on my mind.
I'll tell you what's on my mind.
You know what's on my mind?
If I had my own private genie and my best friend wanted to borrow her from me, I'd let him.
Oh, not again.
Roger, we've been through all this.
Jeannie won't do me any harm.
Oh, of course not.
You see?
She won't mean to, but that's what will happen, anyway.
Well, you know that.
I don't want to keep her.
All I want is three little wishes.
No.
Two wishes?
Roger.
One teensy-weensy wish?
Oh, please, may I, master?
Listen, I'll never ask you another thing in my whole life.
Just one wish.
What have you got to lose?
I don't know.
I haven't heard the wish yet.
All right, go ahead, give him a wish.
All I want is one One?
One wish?
You're going to give me a wish?
Oh!
Only one now.
Don't go crazy.
Go crazy?
I'm the richest man in the whole world.
Oh, am I rich.
Yachts, chateaus.
Ah.
You wish to be the richest man in the whole world.
No!
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Maybe I should look like Gregory Peck.
Ah, can you imagine all those girls falling in love with me?
Ah Gregory Peck.
Wait!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
With all that money, I don't have to look like Gregory Peck.
With all that money, I should live long enough to spend it.
Maybe I should wish for a long life.
Long life.
Oh, wait!
Roger, would you hurry up?
We got a meeting, remember?
Hold your tongue, will ya?
You may be talking to the next president of the United States.
Can you imagine that?
The president of the United States.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Tony.
Oh, I wished I hadn't done that.
Oh, Jeannie, you're wonderful.
And I wished I hadn't done that.
I wished I hadn't done it?
Oh, no!
You can't do this to the next president of the United States.
You said one wish.
And you've had it.
You mean, I've been had.
Oh, I am sorry, Major Healey, but you did wish for the stain to disappear.
That's right.
Thanks, Roge.
Oh, thanks, think nothing of it.
That's the only 5 billion dollar stain in history.
Goodbye, Jeannie.
Wait a minute!
You mean that was my wish?
That's right.
Oh, wait.
Stains don't count.
Boy, these flies are killing me.
Whew!
Get 'em.
Get 'em, get 'em.
Hey, hey.
Will ya?
Will ya?
I'm I'm sorry.
Whew.
Listen, I wanna Oh.
Sorry.
Look at the grease on that thing.
All right, what were you saying?
Oh, I was just saying that, uh I was just saying Oh, Major Nelson.
Hey, look out!
Roger, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm so I don't understand.
I just saw you smear him with that grease, and his uniform is absolutely clean.
Yes.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Well, how do you explain that, Major Nelson?
Well, there's really nothing to explain, sir.
I know what I saw.
Yeah, Roger, will you put that thing down?
Just put it down.
We gotta stop horsing around.
Your blouse won't get dirty.
Yeah, it must be the experiment we're working on, sir.
This is the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
And since you've been here, Major Nelson, I've seen some pretty incredible things.
Yeah.
Well, there's nothing to it, sir.
It's the simplest thing in the world.
How do you do it?
It's the X Factor, sir.
You just, uh, spray this fluid on the material, and it keeps it from permeating.
Remarkable.
Yes.
Well, if you'll excuse us, we have a briefing.
Briefing.
What do you mean?
Oh, briefing.
Briefing.
Let's don't be late for the briefing.
Oh, general, I've got to talk to you.
Is anything wrong?
Wrong?
Oh, uh, just a moment, sir.
Oh, captain, would you please see the general isn't disturbed?
Thank you.
General Peterson, unless I miss my guess, we'll be showing this to the president of the United States by nightfall.
Looks like a can of fly spray.
It might look like a can of fly spray, sir, but it's probably the most exciting discovery ever made.
Would you mind standing up?
You want me to stand up?
Please, general.
Well, uh, what does it do?
You'll see, general.
You'll see.
It has a X Factor in it.
Now, first we spray on the X Factor, then we put on some black grease.
Just like this.
Now, you watch.
Watch closely.
Tea?
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Oh, I wish I hadn't blown that wish this morning.
You oughta consider yourself lucky.
It's the first time I've ever known Jeannie to grant a wish and not have it cause a disaster.
A disaster?
Yeah.
Oh, a disaster.
Wait a minute.
You know how big this is?
A material that's indestructible?
Indestructible?
Who said?
Listen, when Jeannie blinks, she doesn't fool around.
Of course not.
Say, you know you've stumbled on something really marvelous.
Oh, do you really think so, master?
Yeah.
Do you have any idea what this could do to the housewives all over the world?
Well, they'll never have to wash clothes or mend anything.
Nothing will ever get dirty.
Or torn.
Or torn, right.
Torn.
What are you doing?
What are you doing to my?
Well, what are you gonna do?
I want to cut a piece out of this and have it analyzed.
What are you doing?
I broke the scissors.
The scissors.
I saw it.
Your blouse broke the scissors.
Well, how do you explain that, major?
Well, it's part of the same experiment we're working on.
Well, then why didn't the other fluid work?
Oh, the other?
Well, it, uh, probably wasn't fresh.
No, it has to be fresh.
Right.
Exactly.
Is this fresh?
Yes.
Oh, we just got it.
If you don't mind, I'll take this.
Why don't he get his own coffee?
Tea.
Tea.
Believe me, general, I know what went wrong.
The X Factor wasn't fresh.
The X Factor wasn't fresh.
I've just seen this demonstrated.
Watch the scissors break.
Did you realize we can make anything in the world with this material?
We can make suits and dresses and fabrics.
There's no limit to what we can do.
Roger, we're not gonna make anything out of it.
Oh, but why, master?
Well, think, Jeannie, if this ever got on the market, it could Well, it could destroy our whole economy.
I don't think there'd be a fabric firm in existence.
It would affect, uh Well, tailoring establishments, and, uh, cleaning and And clothing manufacturers, and finally, it'd get down to trucks and rail road cars and gasoline.
You dirty blouse.
Let's destroy it before it destroys us.
How are you going to destroy it?
I'm gonna burn it.
Here.
But I do not think it will burn, master.
I wasn't planning on using a match.
I'll hold the torch, Tony.
You light it.
There we are.
Here.
You hold it.
Let's get this thing There we are.
Stand back.
Watch that we don't burn the garage down.
All right.
Let's give this a try.
There's not a mark on it.
I can't believe it.
I don't believe it, either.
But I I just saw it.
You shot that flame at this blouse.
Yes, I I Yes, I did.
You saw it, Major Healey.
Well, I And this blouse is untouched.
You said so yourself.
Did I?
Yeah.
Oh, I did.
Yes.
Don't think I don't know what you're up to.
You're trying to keep this to yourself.
Oh, no, sir.
It's just not ready yet.
I want the secret formula that you used on this, major.
The X Factor.
Uh, we just ran out, sir.
As a matter of fact, we just ran out right now.
What's this?
"Secret Formula".
Uh-huh.
"X Factor".
This is it.
Oh, no, sir.
That's really not it.
It's not I'll just take this with me.
Sir, you see, it's not It's still in the experimental stage.
Mm, Major Nelson, I want you to keep yourself available.
Unless I miss my guess, within 24 hours, we're going to be at the White House.
Now, keep your eye on the blouse, general.
It won't even be touched.
Here.
Let me get it for you.
Are you moving to another office, sir?
You might say that.
Permanently.
I beg your pardon, sir?
Oh, haven't they told you?
General Peterson has transferred me out of Cape Kennedy.
Why?
Because he's found a place where he thinks I might be more useful.
I'm going to Iceland.
Sir?
To work with the Eskimo.
Why would General Peterson do a thing like that?
Your X Factor, major.
My what?
Well, I, uh I tried to show General Peterson how it worked.
I destroyed three of his uniforms.
You didn't.
I don't understand it, but, uh, the X Factor seems only to have worked for you, yes?
Sir, if I knew you were gonna do a thing like that, I would have stopped you.
Would you?
Yes.
I'm sorry I couldn't have stayed around here long enough to find out what makes you tick.
Next to me, you're probably the most interesting psychiatric case I've ever come across.
Next to you, sir?
Yes.
Sometimes I think I'm losing my mind.
One minute I'm rational and then the next minute You do things that Oh, well, maybe the Eskimos will be good for me.
They're simple people.
They don't float in the air or change the days of the week or control the weather.
Sir, perhaps if I have a word with General Peterson myself It won't do any good.
He's in a very upset state.
I, uh When I left him, he was bellowing.
No, I I wouldn't go in there if I were you.
Uh, sir, perhaps Oh, I'd appreciate it very much if you'd write to me from time to time and, uh, let me know what you're doing.
Yes, sir.
Good luck, sir.
Thank you.
Quartermaster?
Oh, hi, captain.
Yeah, this is Major Healey.
Mm-hm.
Look, I was just wondering, how much do we spend a year on uniforms?
Oh, that much.
Look, I was just wondering, uh, what would you think about this, uh What if I came up with a uniform that if you put grease on it, it wouldn't spot.
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
And you couldn't cut it.
I mean, you couldn't tear it or rip it or anything.
Or, if you put a torch to it, it wouldn't burn.
Captain?
Why would I keep Dr. Bellows here?
He's dangerous.
Well, sir, I've worked with Dr. Bellows for the last two years.
And believe me, he's a man I know what he is.
He walked into this office, said we were going to Washington, D.C., put some fly spray on me, and he smeared grease all over my uniform.
Yes, but I-I Then he came back with a pair of scissors, put some tea on me and started cutting up another uniform.
And then he came in, and he set fire to this.
Kind of scorched it.
I-I-I don't suppose it could be patched.
I've got to get him out of here before I run out of clothes.
Look what I gotta wear!
Well, uh, you see, Dr. Bellows is rather highly-strung, sir.
Highly-strung?
He's snapped.
I'm sure if you'd give him another chance, general, he would be If I gave him another chance, by next Monday I'd be naked.
No, sir.
Let the Eskimos worry about him for a while.
Well, I feel partially responsible for this, general.
You see, Dr. Bellows saw Major Healey and I conducting an experiment, and he thought we were able to take an ordinary piece of cloth and make it practically indestructible.
Tony, I admire loyalty in any man.
I'm only coming to his defense, sir, because I don't want to see an injustice done.
Tony, I want to give you a little advice.
Yes, sir.
It's the same advice I'd give you if you were my own son.
Yes, sir.
Get out.
Check.
Checkmate.
Congratulations.
Oh, thank you, master.
Is anything wrong?
They're sending Dr. Bellows to Iceland.
Oh!
And this does not please you?
No.
It does not please me.
Oh, well, where would you like him to go?
I wouldn't like him to go anywhere.
Jeannie, Dr. Bellows is being punished for something that was not his fault.
And would you like to know whose fault it is?
Hm, no, I do not think so.
One little wish.
You grant Roger Healey one little wish, and we lose Dr. Bellows.
He's a very good man.
This base can't afford to lose him.
Well, did you explain this to General Peterson?
General Peterson.
He just tossed me out of his office.
He He toss  Now, wait a minute!
Now, don't, please.
Not General Peterson.
I don't need that.
No, I really don't need that.
Well, surely there must be someone above General Peterson?
Yeah.
Well, there's General Burke.
That's his immediate superior.
But he's at the Pentagon.
How would I ever explain that to him?
Oh, do not worry, master.
I will explain it.
Yeah  Oh!
Good afternoon, airman.
Yes?
Ah, it's General Patterson.
Peterson.
Ah, of course.
I'm Colonel Harris.
General Burke sent me.
Well, I'm very happy to know you, colonel.
General Burke here?
Here?
No, he'll be down later.
He wanted me to tell you how pleased he is with the work you've been doing, general.
Is he?
Well, we all try to do our best.
We have a good team here, you know.
Those are the general's exact words.
Um, may I tell you something in confidence?
Why, certainly, colonel.
The reason the general is coming here is to give a special commendation to one of the members of your team.
Well, that's wonderful.
Who is he?
Uh, Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows.
Uh, General Burke says he's been doing a great job.
Well, where is he, general?
Well, as a matter of fact, Dr. Bellows is Is just leaving on a little trip.
He may even be gone by now.
General Burke is gonna be surprised to hear you could spare him.
But I suppose it's just for the weekend.
You know, General Burke and Dr. Bellows are old classmates.
Old classmates.
I didn't know that.
Oh, yes.
General Burke thinks the world of Dr. Bellows.
He does?
Yes, they're cousins.
They're cousins.
First cousins.
Well, I don't think Dr. Bellows will be going away on that trip after all.
You tell General Burke I'd find it hard to get along without him.
Oh, goody!
Um, uh, the General will be pleased to hear that.
Will you excuse me for a moment, colonel?
Just make yourself at home.
Whee!
Oh, Dr. Bellows, I Yes, general?
What are you doing?
Doing?
I'm packing.
Packing?
Where you going?
Where am I going?
You've sent me to Siberia Um, I mean, Iceland.
Do you know the trouble with you, doctor?
You're too sensitive.
I'm too sensitive?
Well, you don't really think we could get along around here without you, did ya?
But, general, you ordered me to pack my things and get out.
Oh.
And you thought I meant it?
Didn't you?
Well, as I was just saying to a friend of your cousin's, I couldn't possibly get along without you.
My cousin's?
After all, uh, what's a few uniforms?
General, you mean I don't have to leave Cape Kennedy?
Why, I wouldn't dream of letting ya go.
I'll deduct the uniforms from your pay.
I don't know what to say.
Well, don't say anything.
And Doctor?
Yes?
Try to get plenty of rest.
I certainly will.
Oh, and I'm awfully sorry about your uniforms.
Oh, forget it.
Oh, I'll never forget it, general.
So Jeannie came back here, and she called General Peterson and told him that General Burke would not be able to make it until the later part of the month.
Oh, that's marvelous.
Well, I guess the old quack is still with us.
He's not a quack, Roger.
He's a very competent man.
Oh, I enjoyed getting him out of trouble.
Mm.
Well, you should.
You enjoyed getting him into it enough.
I did not.
You did too.
Are you finished?
Huh?
Yeah.
Look, Jeannie I did not.
You did too.
Listen, I know you didn't mean to  Wait a minute, will ya?
I'm the one that got cheated out of the wish.
I didn't get to finish my strawberry shortcake.
Now, all I want is one wish.
What's wrong with that?
No, no, Roger.
Just one.
I'm not gonna grant Now, wait a minute.
Please, master, may I, please?
Now, don't you start on me.
She wants to give me I've had enough of this.
No!
No All right!
All right!
All right?
You mean you're gonna give me one wish?
Oh, boy!
I'm rich.
Oh, yachts and chateaus.
Chateaus and yachts.
Yeah, I got it.
Wait, no.
Wait, wait, wait!
I'll be a rich movie star, that's it.
A movie star.
Movie star?
Rich movie star.
No, no, no, no!
Oh, wait.
Maybe I should be a brain surgeon.
Brain surgeon.
Roger, you know, you're the funniest man I've ever met.
You know something?
You know what I wished when I was a little boy?
I-I wished I were the funniest man in the world.
Here, you hold this and I'll hold this.
Aw.
Hi, Groucho.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
You did not eat your breakfast, master.
Oh, no, I didn't have time, Jeannie.
Oh.
Will you be home for lunch?
No, I can't make that either.
I have a conference this morning with General Peterson and Dr. Bellows, and then there's some NASA officials coming down from Washington.
Oh, that is a shame.
I thought we might have lunch at a marvelous little restaurant I know of on the Left Bank.
I wish I could, but There's no, uh There's no Left Bank in Cocoa Beach.
Well, there is in Paris.
It is called Chez Moustache.
It is in a quaint little part of town, with a cobblestone street in front and people Some other day, huh?
Sorry.
Ooh.
They make a marvelous cheese soufflÃ© there.
Why don't you go there?
Oh, I could not do that.
It would not be any fun without you, master.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Master?
Mm-hm?
Do you read French?
Yeah, a little.
I I studied it in school.
Can you read this?
Hm?
Oh, sure.
Uh, "Je desire Ãªtre a Paris".
Oh, that's easy.
Um, "I wish I were in Paris".
Oh, master!
I'm sorry.
I-I, uh Monsieur.
Welcome to Paris, master.
Yeah, I-I'm terribly sorry.
Jeannie, I told you, I'm supposed to be at a meeting.
Oh, please, do not be angry, master.
You must eat lunch and this was right on the way.
Right on the way to where?
The Eiffel Tower?
I'm due to be walking into the conference room at NASA headquarters right this minute.
Oh, that is no problem, master.
You are at NASA.
Mm.
Huh?
Now, shall we order the cheese soufflÃ©?
Where's Major Nelson?
Oh, he's always on time, general.
He should be here any minute, sir.
I'm sorry I'm late, sir.
Oh, Tony.
You know everybody.
Yes.
All right, let's all sit down.
Excuse me.
Got a long day ahead of us.
Are?
Are you telling me that I'm at the meeting at Cape Kennedy right now?
Have I ever deceived you?
Well, let's not go into that.
But I don't understa How can I be here and there at the same time?
Oh, that is child's play.
If you like, we could also be having lunch in Rome right now.
Oh, no.
Believe me, I'm nervous enough as it is.
Y-you're sure nothing can go wrong?
Oh, believe me, master.
All that can happen is that you will have a marvelous lunch and then you can go back to work.
I'll remember everything that happens at Kennedy?
Well, of course.
You are there.
I am there.
Oh, let me explain it to you.
You see, you concentrate on a polliwog No, please, please.
I might understand, don't tell me.
Really, don't.
Monsieur.
Hm?
Could I help you?
Oh, yes Uh, oui.
I would, um  Je desire um, um, soufflÃ© adieu.
Adieu?
Adieu.
Oh, pour deux.
Por deux.
Bon.
I-I tout suite.
That was very good, master.
Well, I haven't used it since high school.
The primary reason I came down here myself is to let you know how excited Washington is about the potential of Operation: Galaxy.
Gentlemen, for the first time, we have a really big jump on every other country.
And we intend to keep it that way.
That's right.
Washington wants to be certain that we maintain absolute security.
Well, you can reassure Washington on that score.
Oh, yes, gentlemen.
Our security here is foolproof.
Yeah.
Once I forgot my pass and I had to spend the whole day at the beach with a blond.
Do you like it, master?
Jeannie, it's the best thing I've eaten in my life, really.
Oh, did I not tell you?
Yeah.
I wonder how I'm doing at the meeting.
Mm.
Brilliantly, master.
Oh, good.
Look.
Isn't that the American astronaut, Major Nelson?
Yes.
But what is he doing in Paris?
I don't know why we were not informed of his arrival.
Maybe they sneaked him in.
It is a deliberate insult to the French air force.
De Gaulle will be furious.
Perhaps he only looks like Major Nelson.
For his sake, I hope so.
I know.
I will call my good friend, Dr. Bellows, at NASA, and find out what marches.
Allons.
So phase three will only go off if phase two and phase one go off perfectly.
Dr. Bellows.
Excuse me, sir, but I have a call for you from Paris.
From Paris?
For me?
Yes, sir.
They say it's urgent.
On line one.
Thank you.
Before we commit ourselves to any final steps.
Here's the next plan.
So phase three will take place only if phase one and phase two Dr. Bellows here.
Dr. Bellows, this is General Rafael.
We were wondering why we were not notified that Major Nelson was coming to Paris.
We would have been happy to have given him a reception.
Major Nelson?
He's not going to Paris.
Heh, I did not say he was going to Paris, Dr. Bellows.
He is in Paris.
But that's impossible.
He's right here.
I'm looking at him.
So am I. Well, I don't know who you're looking at, but I can assure you that it's not Major Nelson.
Well, it's probably someone who resembles him.
Of course.
One who is wearing an American Air Force uniform, a NASA insignia and an astronaut wings?
And he's in Paris now?
Dans le devant my very eyes.
What's he doing?
He's eating a cheese soufflÃ©.
It looks delicious.
General Rafael, I wonder if you could do something for me.
Uh, could you, uh, take a picture of the man you have there and wire me a telephoto?
A picture?
But?
But why?
Because obviously one of us is looking at an impostor.
And, uh, this system is the responsibility of Houston control.
Would you like another soufflÃ©, master?
Oh, no Jeannie.
I couldn't eat another bite.
It was just marvelous.
Why, I knew you would enjoy this.
And believe me, you will not get into any trouble.
Yeah, well, that'll be a change, won't it?
Uh, no, merci.
Master, if you are through, I think perhaps we should leave.
Maybe you're right.
I hate to rush, but I really have to get back and do some kind of work, don't I?
Uh, garÃ§on.
Monsieur.
L'addition, si vous plais.
Ah, tout suite, monsieur.
Here it is, sir.
It's just come over the wire.
Let me see it, please.
It is Major Nelson or his double.
Operation: Galaxy.
Spies are after information on Operation: Galaxy?
Yes, sir, and they're diabolically clever.
And you think that someone at Cape Kennedy is involved.
I know it.
Who is it?
That's just it, sir.
I'm not sure.
Because it's either him or his double.
I can't believe it's he, so it must be his double.
And if it is his double, it would explain everything, and I mean everything.
Oh, yes, of course it would.
Is this the first time that you've come across spies, doctor?
Uh, yes, sir.
Well, don't you think we need a little proof?
Oh, don't worry.
I'll get all the proof I need.
As, uh Soon as I find out who's who.
Yes, you do that.
Uh, thank you, sir.
Master?
Yes, Jeannie.
Master, did you like that cheese soufflÃ©?
I told you I did.
It was wonderful.
Then let us move to Paris.
Move to Paris?
Yes, now.
You will love living in Paris.
What are you talking about?
What I?
What would I possibly do in Paris?
Escape.
Escape from what?
Oh, master, how do you get yourself into these situations?
What are you talking about?
In my office, please.
Hello, sir.
I'd like to, uh, talk to you a minute, Major Nelson.
It is Major Nelson, isn't it?
Yes, sir.
I'm after a piece of information.
Now, we're gonna play a little game.
I'm going to ask you some questions, and you are going to answer them.
What sort of questions, sir?
Oh, you'll see.
I, uh I want you to answer quickly and without thinking.
Ready?
Yes, sir.
Who did Sandy Koufax pitch for?
Sandy Koufax?
Quickly, major.
Oh, uh, the Dodgers.
Oh.
What, uh, goes on hot dogs?
Mustard, uh, relish, uh, sauerkraut What was the name of your first flight instructor?
Dick Olson.
Dick Olson.
Mm.
Where was President Lincoln shot?
Uh, the Ford Theater, sir.
What was the name of the first grammar school you ever attended?
Horace Mann.
Oh.
I'll have some more questions for you later.
Uh Did you, uh, get the information you wanted to?
Don't worry, major.
I'm getting it.
I'm getting it.
I think I've got a bigger one back there.
Come this way please, I'll show you.
You look around back there.
Whatever you find, bring it in.
I think I can help you.
Well, if it isn't Shh.
No names, please.
I'm sorry.
I'm here on a very confidential mission.
What can I do for you, doc?
I want to buy a listening device.
A bug.
Yes.
Uh, something that can't be detected.
You came to the right place.
I think I've got just what the doctor ordered.
See this?
This little beauty?
This is perfect for you.
It's so tiny.
Yeah, but that That's the beauty of it.
See, this is a magnetic microphone.
Stick it on a piece of metal, and Boom, it stays right there.
Uh, where are the wires?
No wires.
You are living in the horse-and-buggy days.
See, this mic is tuned to the same frequency as this receiver, and you can listen in on a range of up to a mile.
Perfect.
I'll take it.
I sure hope you catch her.
Catch her?
Yeah.
That's the way I caught my wife.
I'll wrap it up for you.
Good.
Oh.
Whoop, whoop, careful, careful.
I'm sorry.
You want to finish up those charts this afternoon?
No, I'd better get home.
I have a feeling something's wrong.
You mean, uh Yeah, she popped in here with some wild story.
About me escaping to Paris.
That is wild.
You have no idea how nervous this whole thing is making me.
I haven't had a moment's peace since I-I first got involved.
You know what you should do?
Sit down and have a nice long talk with Dr. Bellows.
TONY : Yeah.
Oh, yeah, that's  I'm not kidding.
You're so nervous lately.
You need a long vacation.
No, there isn't any place I could go without being found.
Well, as long as Dr. Bellows doesn't find out, I guess you'll be all right.
Hey, look at that, will ya?
Do you know what that looks like?
That just looks like it might A beautiful day.
Uh, let's take a walk, huh?
You kidding?
Who wants to walk?
I just discovered That exercise is the best thing in the world for you.
I don't want to exercise.
I want A breath of fresh air.
Hi.
Hi.
That was a microphone.
You mean you knew?
That's right.
Oh, I get it.
You don't want whoever's listening to know that you're on to him.
That's the idea.
Give me a dime.
That's quick thinking.
You could be a secret agent.
Do you have any idea what this means?
No.
Spies on the base.
Spies?
That's right.
They're probably after information on Operation: Galaxy.
And we gotta track 'em down.
Someone planted a microphone in your office?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
And it was about this big, sir.
It was, uh I-I know it sounds incredible that anything like this should happen on this base, sir.
It doesn't sound as incredible as you think.
This is the second espionage report I've had.
It is?
Yes, Dr. Bellows is on the trail of a spy ring.
Sir, why don't we all get together and track 'em down?
Wait, I think I know how to trap whoever planted that microphone in my office.
All right.
I'll leave it to you.
There's only one thing I'll ask.
Yes, sir.
I want to be in on the kill.
Now, you remember what you're supposed to do?
I don't like this.
This could be dangerous.
It's our chance to crack an espionage ring.
Just Just be natural.
Yeah, I'm going to be natural.
I'm going bowling.
Well, it's been a very successful day.
Yes, it has been a very successful day.
We have the information.
All we have to do is pass it on.
Yes, we have the information.
Now, all we have Have to do is pass it on.
Where are we going to meet?
Where?
Where are we going to meet?
You know the old warehouse near the beach?
Yes, I know the old warehouse!
It is near the beach.
Well, uh, we're going to meet there tonight and pass on the information to the chief.
Yes, that is a good place to pass on the information to the chief.
Uh, 3:15.
Perhaps you'd like to know what time?
Oh, yes, what time?
What time?
Midnight.
Midnight.
The old warehouse.
Midnight.
I'll get some flashlights, we'll be on our way.
Oh, master, I must talk to you.
Not right now, Jeannie.
We have something to do.
Yeah, we got some spies to catch.
Boy, I feel just like James Bond.
Oh, please do not go out tonight, master.
It's all right.
General Peterson and his men will be there.
Do you know who they are after, master?
No, no, but after tonight, whoever they are will be in jail.
Oh, dear.
Jeannie?
Yeah, it will serve them right.
Oh.
And I cannot talk you out of going, master?
Not a chance in the world.
Would you mind moving?
I need some lights.
Then I must go with you.
That's not exactly the kind of light I had in mind.
Please let me go, master.
No, I'm afraid You must not go alone.
This is men's work, you'll stay here, no arguments.
Please!
Ooh!
Great.
You take that.
Please let me go, master.
No, Jeannie.
You must not go alone.
I need to be adamant, I must insist.
Please?
No.
Very well, master.
Good luck.
Boy, you sure know how to handle her.
You just have to be firm.
Hey, there's nothing down there.
Look, dresses.
These look pretty good.
Good enough.
Let's grab 'em and get out of here.
Somebody.
I'll take care of him.
Psst.
Somebody else is coming.
Let's get out of here.
It's like Grand Central Station.
It's midnight.
They should be there now.
Yeah, but what are your plans?
I'll go in alone and give 'em a chance to jump me.
Good thinking.
If you want me, I'll be in the bowling alley.
Now, wait two minutes, and then come in after me.
Are you kidding?
There might be a whole mob of guys in there.
Roger, don't worry.
General Peterson and his men will be here soon.
They'll be covering the place.
Hey, what time you got?
I have 12:02.
I've got 12:03.
Two minutes, remember.
Yeah.
Get out of sight.
Hold it, major.
Turn around.
Who are you?
All right, buddy, hold it.
I got you covered.
Dr. Bellows?
What are you doing here?
Watch it, major!
Ugh!
All right, that's enough.
Get your hands up!
Take those two men out!
Hi, fellas.
Hey!
I'm not late, am I?
No, it's all over, Roge.
Not quite.
I'm arresting you for espionage.
You're arresting Major Nelson for espionage?
No, general.
I am not arresting Major Nelson.
I am arresting this man.
Who do you think I am?
I know who you are.
You're Major Nelson's double.
Major Nelson is being held prisoner somewhere in Paris.
Why, you dirty rat!
What have you done with my best friend?
Roger, it's me!
Oh, it's him.
Dr. Bellows, you better explain what this is all about and fast.
I shall be very happy to, general.
I planted a microphone in Major Nelson's office.
You're the one that planted He planted the microphone Yes!
You see, I know the real Major Nelson as well as I know myself.
He would never be involved in anything like this.
So I heard you making plans to pass on the secret information to your chief tonight, I knew that you were the double.
What makes you think there's a double?
I don't think, general, I know.
I have the proof right here.
This picture was taken at a sidewalk cafÃ© in Paris, yesterday.
Who do you think it is?
It looks like General de Gaulle.
No, it's uh General de Gaulle.
Yes, it's a very good likeness of General de Gaulle.
Is there anything that you would like to say?
Yes, sir.
He's done it to me again.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
I am ready, master.
Hm?
Oh.
Oh, good, good.
Shall we leave now?
Uh, leave for where?
Why?
Why'd you do that, Jeannie?
Because you said that we were going for a drive, and I am ready.
Oh, I love to ride in your car.
Oh, uh, I'm I'm sorry, I can't take you for a drive today.
You promised.
Yea I I know I did, Jeannie, but I have an awful lot of work to do.
It's very technical.
Would you mind giving me my papers back, huh?
Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, thanks.
You, uh, you are sure that you cannot go for a drive today?
Yes, I'm I'm, uh I'm positive.
Maybe tomorrow, huh?
It is such a pretty car.
Perhaps I could go driving without you.
Yeah, yeah, why don't you do that.
Thank you, master.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Oh, I  Hi, how are ya, Dr. Bellows?
Are you all right, sir?
I was until I got on the street where you live.
That was your car that I just saw moving down the street without a driver in it, wasn't it?
Hm?
Oh, yes, yes, well, I can explain that Uh, don't explain it, Major Nelson.
I'm gonna try to convince myself that this never happened.
Drop in any time, sir.
Good morning, officer.
Is something wrong?
Do you know this is a one-way street?
Mm.
I was only going one way.
Very amusing, but you went through a red light to get here.
Let me see your driver's license.
My what?
Your license to drive.
Do you have one?
Oh, yes, but it is a little old.
You mean, it's expired?
To tell you the truth, I would not be at all surprised.
Uh, let's see it.
There is a license to drive a chariot.
Yes, I told you it was a little old.
Is this your car?
Oh, no, Major Nelson let me borrow it.
Here.
Thank you.
It is very pretty.
Uh, what do I do with it?
Bring it with you when you come to court Monday morning.
Court?
Oh, I do not think Major Nelson would like it if I went to court.
You have a nice face.
I am sure you would not want to see Major Nelson unhappy.
If you will forget about everything, I will give you anything you wish.
Are you, um, offering me money?
If that is what you wish.
How much?
Oh, how much would you like?
Ten dollars?
If that is what you want.
Attempted bribery, $10.
Twenty dollars?
Twenty dollars.
All right.
All right!
May I go now?
Not in this car you can't.
But why not?
Because this isn't a chariot.
You don't have a license, lady.
Well, what are you going to do with the car?
I'm going to have it towed in.
Would you step out, please?
You went down a one-way street the wrong way.
Well, that is what the policeman said, but the red light was so tiny, I did not see And you went through a red light?
Y-yes, but it was not my fault.
And they towed the car away?
Oh, yes, master.
But But otherwise, I had no problem at all.
Yeah.
Jeannie, you You I gotta get my car back.
Well, have you, uh, talked to the police yet?
Yeah, I talked to the sergeant at the desk.
He said an officer named Anderson gave Jeannie the ticket.
Anderson.
Don Anderson.
Don Anderson.
I've heard that name before.
He was written up in Theme magazine for giving more tickets than any other policeman in America.
Oh, that guy.
How'd you get mixed up with him?
Roger, I didn't get mixed up with him.
Jeannie got mixed What's the matter with you?
Well, Dr. Bellows could probably get your car back.
He has the whole Air Force behind him.
Naw, he'd never do it.
He'd say I deserved what I was getting by lending my car to somebody who'd Who'd, uh Hey, wait a minute.
I can get my car back within the hour.
What do you mean?
I know how to get Dr. Bellows to do it for me.
Oh, that should be easy.
All you have to do is to tell him that you lent your car to a genie who hasn't driven in 2000 years, and she's a little rusty.
No, no, all I need to use is a little psychology.
Guy finally gets a genie, and they took his car away.
I'm sorry I'm late with these lab reports, sir.
I would have been here sooner, but I had to wait for a taxi.
Taxi?
Where's your car?
You mean, the secret experimental car that you saw me in this morning?
Mm.
Well, the police have it.
Uh, that's about it, sir.
I think I'd better get back to work.
Just a moment.
Yes, sir.
Did you say the police have it?
Oh, yes, sir.
They impounded it for some minor traffic and violation.
It's nothing really important.
Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
It's full of secret equipment and you let it fall into the hands of the police?
Well, there's really nothing I could do about it.
They just took it.
Well, they're not gonna get away with that.
The name of the officer that impounded it is named Don Anderson.
Pretty tough guy.
Oh, tough?
Yeah.
So is the Air Force.
Hello?
Sergeant.
Get me the police commissioner.
You'll have your car back within an hour.
No, I don't know, sir.
I don't think they'll give it back.
Don Anderson Oh, won't he?
Well, we'll see about that.
I see.
Uh I wasn't aware of that, sir.
Thank you, commissioner.
The Air Force appreciates it, sir.
Goodbye.
Well, you didn't give me all the facts in the case, major.
The facts, sir?
You allowed a young lady to drive this secret car of yours.
Oh, that, yes, well, uh This Officer Anderson, who issued the summons, is objecting strenuously, but because of the military secrecy involved, the commissioner's agreed to drop all the charges.
Oh, that's wonderful, sir.
You certainly handled this brilliantly, I must say.
Mm, didn't I. I don't know anyone who could've done so well.
Well, after all, I am a psychiatrist.
We deal in all kinds of situations.
Those years of study have really paid off, haven't they?
Well, I'll go pick up the car.
Oh, major.
Yes?
I think this is the first time I've ever had a snow job in July.
That's all, major.
Oh, he is back.
Oh, master!
Master, you got our car back.
Not our car.
No, no, my car.
You're not to go near that car, Jeannie.
You mean, I cannot drive anymore?
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
Oh, but I love to drive.
It is more fun than a flying carpet.
Jeannie, you are not If you go near that car, I'm gonna get in a lot of trouble.
Oh.
Well, I do not want you to get into trouble.
That's a good girl.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Say, uh, Jeannie, how'd you like a bicycle?
I'm sorry I'm not a better driver, master.
Oh, that's all right.
I am too stupid to learn.
Oh, no, you're not, it's just, well, our laws are different.
It's not like driving in the old days.
You're right, master.
I could never learn to drive here.
Sure, you could.
It's easy.
Well, I don't know, it would take me 100 years to learn.
Jeannie, I could teach you in an hour, just like that, really.
Could you, master?
Sure.
I am ready.
You are the most wonderful master in the whole world.
But not the brightest.
All right, I'm gonna teach you about intersections.
I want you to go back to that one-way street.
Oh, I want to learn, master.
With me in the car, there's nothing to worry about.
Okay, start her up.
We're coming to the one-way street, turn left.
Left.
Right.
Right.
Huh?
Jeannie, do you know what you've done to me?
You've done it to me again.
Uh, hello, officer.
Having a good time?
I'll just move it out of the way right now.
You were driving from the wrong side of the car.
Oh, yes, well, it's one of these cars we used to Hey, wait a minute, I've seen this car before Aren't you Major Anthony Nelson?
Yes, yes, that's correct, United States Air Force.
I've sure been anxious to get your autograph.
Oh, I'd be glad to give it to you.
Violation of city ordinances Here you are, please sign right there.
"Astronaut who found his way through space gets lost on a one-way street ".
Hi, Tony, I'm just reading about you.
Did you, uh, see the front page yet?
Yes, I've seen it, and Dr. Bellows has seen it, and General Peterson has seen it, and It's a good picture of you.
A good picture?
What are you talking about?
I don't go around like that.
Wait a minute, what happened?
I was teaching Jeannie how to drive.
I should've had my head examined.
I think you're going to.
Yeah?
I have been looking for you, Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
I've just had a meeting with General Peterson about you.
Oh, how is the general?
The general is upset.
He just had a call from Washington from General Burke.
General Burke is upset.
Well, if you ask me, the whole thing's pretty funny.
Oh, uh, do you?
The press has been calling me all morning.
They're having quite a field day with this little joke.
Oh, is that right, sir.
Well, I'm sure they'll forget about it as soon as you call the police commissioner again and Well, General Peterson has asked me not to call anyone.
You see, uh, Officer Anderson, who issued the ticket to your friend, is complaining that, uh, the Air Force has exercised undue influence.
Sounds like a troublemaker to me.
General Peterson asked me to tell you that from now on, you're on your own.
Do you understand, major?
Oh, yes, yes, sir.
Oh, nice picture of you, major.
And, uh, we'll be reading the newspapers very closely.
You see, even Dr. Bellows likes it.
Huh?
Aw.
Boy, listen to him, you'd think you'd committed a murder or something.
All you did was go down a one-way street the wrong way.
Hey, that's pretty funny when you think about it.
A one-way street  Yeah, I just hope the judge thinks it's that funny.
Well, you shouldn't have had Dr. Bellows fix that ticket.
They're really mad now.
When Officer Anderson gets you in front of that court He's going to love you.
Huh?
Oh, why didn't I think about this before.
All you have to do is apologize.
What are you talking about?
Just say you're sorry.
Have a nice man to man talk with him.
Yeah, I don't know, Roge.
Doesn't sound like it would work Well, you got nothing to lose.
Yeah, and I suppose it I could try it.
I could go down to the station and ask the desk sergeant if he could put me on No, no, no, don't go to the station.
Too cold.
Go to his house.
That's nice and friendly.
Nice and warm, and remember: Yeah?
Be jolly nice.
Uh, Officer Anderson?
Yeah?
Oh, hello, major.
Hello.
What do you want?
Oh, I was just wondering if I could talk to you a couple of minutes.
Come on in.
Thank you.
What can I do for you, major?
Frankly, I'd like to talk to you about the summons you gave me.
Oh, you would.
Yeah.
Just let me get a cigarette.
Of course.
Thank you.
Sit down, major.
Oh, thank you.
Probably more comfortable.
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.
Say, uh, you, uh You have quite a reputation.
You, uh, I-I read the article in Theme magazine last week, and it was excellent, really excellent.
Oh, thank you.
You have quite a reputation yourself.
Well, that's part of the reason I wanted to talk to you.
I suppose being celebrities of a sort.
You mean, you came to talk to me about the ticket?
Yes.
Um Well, I wanted to apologize for what happened.
You mean you admit you were wrong?
Yes, I did make a mistake.
You violated the law.
Well, I-I don't want you to think it was intentional.
It certain But you did.
Yes, yes, I did, and, uh, I Now that I've said I'm sorry, I feel much better for it.
Um, I'm a serviceman myself.
I understand about duty.
Right, well, I'll see you in court on Monday.
Huh?
Oh, thank you.
Well, it's certainly been nice talking to you, and Oh, what a splendid-looking, young chap.
Is this your son?
My nephew.
Loves the space age.
Big fan of yours.
Oh, really.
Say, uh, I'll bet he would like a model of the X-15.
Is that an offer?
Oh, well, yes, yes.
Oh, thank you.
If you would just give me his address, I could I beg your pardon.
I said if you could give me his address, I could send it immediately.
Oh, that won't be necessary, major.
The offer is all I wanted to hear.
Nice boy.
You just tried to bribe me.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Roge.
Hi, hi.
Can I talk to you a minute?
I'm I'm sorry, I'm kind of busy right now, I'm going to court.
Yeah, well, that's what I'd like to talk to you about.
I'd like to go with you.
What for?
Well, I thought maybe I could be your lawyer.
You don't have one, do you?
I don't think I need a lawyer.
Well, that's where you almost made a very serious mistake.
You gotta have somebody speak for you.
It's just a small, little case.
It's a traffic case, you know.
There's nothing small or simple in law, you know.
What do you know about it?
Well, I studied pre-law before I was an astronaut.
I probably could fix it up, so you wouldn't get a fine at all.
Hey, you did, you had a whole year of law.
Listen, if you can't help your best friend, why, who can you help?
Hey, that's right.
You'll be out in two seconds.
You would be a lot better than me.
Just let me do all the talking.
Don't say anything.
Yeah.
You've heard the facts of the case, Mr. Zane.
What have you got to say about it?
I have been stealing fruits, Your Honor, but I've been out of work for four months and have six kids at home to feed.
As soon as I get a job, I'll pay it all back.
Mm-hm.
All right.
I'm sorry, but I have to give you $30 or 30 days.
However, I'll suspend that sentence when restitution is made.
Look, don't worry about a thing.
Just leave it to me.
The meaner they are, the better I like 'em.
Don't do anything flashy.
Just leave it to me.
Anthony Nelson.
That's us.
Uh, Your Honor, I'm representing Major Nelson.
Is the arresting officer here?
Officer Anderson, Your Honor.
Ah, the defendant is charged with, uh, going the wrong way down a one-way street.
Uh, sir, I We plead guilty.
I'd like to pay the fine.
And attempting to bribe an officer in the performance of his duty.
How do you plead?
A-a-a bribe?
A bribe.
A bribe.
A bribe.
Sir, could I talk to my client a couple of minutes?
One minute.
One minute.
What's this about a bribe?
You didn't tell me anything about a bribe Roge Roger, Roger, I promised Wait a minute, I promised to send his nephew a model of the X-15, that's all.
That's all?
And he We'll fix him.
Your Honor, this whole thing has become ridiculous.
I would hardly call an offer of a model plane a bribe.
What do you have to say to that?
It wouldn't be an important bribe to you or to me, but to a 10-year-old boy, it would mean a lot.
And he was trying to reach me through that little boy.
Gee, that's right.
I never thought of it that way.
How could you possibly do that to a little boy?
I don't believe that you could Oh, ahem, well, if Officer Anderson's going to take that attitude, my client and I are not gonna plead guilty to anything.
Don't worry about a thing.
They made a mistake.
They made me mad.
Since the defendant denies all the charges, does the arresting officer wish to offer evidence?
Yes, Your Honor.
I was at the scene.
I saw Major Nelson violating the ordinances cited.
I object!
Sit down.
Yes, sir.
For the record, could you identify Major Nelson?
Certainly, Your Honor.
Major Nelson is right there.
And there.
There.
And there.
What are you talking about, Officer Anderson?
Can you identify Major Nelson or not?
My eyes are a little blurred, Your Honor, but I-I would like to show the court a motion picture I took of Major Nelson's confession.
I think this will clear up any questions the court may have.
Uh, bailiff, please.
ANDERSON : Hello, major.
Come on in.
Sit down here, major.
Oh!
Hey, did you see the look on Anderson's face when he ran that film?
Yeah, now, look, I don't want you to be too amused, especially in front of Jeannie.
All right, come on, cool it.
Uh, Jeannie, would you come out, please?
Did it go well, master?
Oh, yes, yes, it just It went fine, Jeannie.
But I don't want you to think that all police officers are like Officer Anderson.
Oh, I do not, master.
Good, and in the future, you just stay out of his way, huh.
Oh, I will, master.
Hey, how about me in there, huh?
Me, was I pretty good?
Maybe I should've been a lawyer?
Yeah, sure.
Hey, you want to stay for dinner?
No, I've gotta be going.
I'm having trouble with my car.
Can I use yours?
Oh, sure.
May I have the keys, please?
Are you going driving, Major Healey?
No, Jeannie.
I'm going straight home.
I will drive you home.
Sure, you will, yeah.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Wait!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Oh, oh, good morning, officer.
Watch it, don't turn, don't turn.
Whoa, Jeannie.
Watch it.
Tony!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I love Sundays, master.
Yeah.
Is it your favorite day of the week?
Uh-huh.
You do not have to work.
Yeah, that's right.
What would you like to do?
Read my paper.
I know a wonderful game.
Why do we not play hub-a-toe?
Hub-a-toe?
Mm-hm.
I-I-it is a lovely game.
You have a A little white ball, and two small paddles, and a table with a net spread across.
And the object is to get the ball Oh.
Jeannie, that That's called Ping-Pong.
O-oh, it is called hub-a-toe.
No, Ping-Pong.
Hub-a-toe.
No, really, Ping-Pong.
Hub-a-toe.
Well, I can't play hub-a-toe, because I don't have a hub-a-toe table.
There.
Oh.
How about that?
I still can't play.
I don't have a hub-a-toe paddle.
Hm-hm.
Ha.
All right.
But I warn you, in high school, I was a hub-a-toe champion.
We shall see.
Yeah.
Ah!
Jeannie, you're pretty good, you know that?
What are you doing?
Who's winning?
Oh, uh Uh, hi.
Hello.
I'd be fascinated to know how you do that, major.
Oh, it's a It's a new theory I'm working on.
Um reactive aerodynamics.
I knew it.
You did?
We must apologize for intruding on your Sunday like this, but we were just passing by We were nowhere near the place.
Oh, no, it's all my fault, major.
I made Alfred drop by.
I've been dying to see your house.
Oh, you have?
Yes.
A bachelor living all alone.
I can't wait to see what you've done with it.
Oh.
It's just an ordinary, everyday, run-of-the-mill house.
You could call this house a lot of things, major.
But I don't think you could call it that.
Do you mind if I take a peek?
Oh, uh Uh Uh, Mrs. Bellows I'm sorry, but when Amanda makes up her mind Uh, yes, sir.
Oh.
It's charming.
Utterly charming.
Oh, well, I'm glad you like it.
It looks so lived in.
Yes.
You know, the way Alfred described it, I, uh, expected to see more of a haunted house.
And you live here all alone.
Yes.
Well, I'm just going to have to find a nice young girl for you.
Ooh.
Wh-what happened?
Oh, it's It's, uh It's the wind.
When the the kitchen door is opened, it whips around the corner here.
Oh, what a heaven kitchen.
Yes.
We're just going to have to get you married.
Ahh!
Oh!
But major, there's no wind.
Uh, cat, sir.
You don't have a cat.
The neighbor's cat.
It's awfully hard to keep out of here.
It keeps walking in here all the time.
Oh, I must say, major, you have excellent taste.
Thank you.
You're going to make someone a marvelous husband.
Oh!
Huh?
Oh, Alfred.
Look!
It's exactly what I've been looking for, for the living room.
You know, that place over in the Oh.
Wherever did you find it?
I, uh, picked it up on a deserted island in the Pacific.
It's just a little piece of bad luck.
I must have it.
Well, I I really couldn't let it go, Mrs. Bellows, I'm sorry.
Well, look at it this way.
You're a major and my husband is a colonel.
Well I I understand, major.
Oh.
Thank you.
But we can have it copied.
Yes, Salvatori & Sons can make an exact duplicate of this.
That's an excellent idea.
Now, don't you worry.
Don't you worry about your bottle, major.
I'll bring it in first thing in the morning.
It will take no time at all to make a copy of it.
I don't think it's a good idea.
Why don't you let me give you a lamp?
Or the couch?
It's a brand new couch.
No, no, no.
I have what I want.
When Amanda makes up her mind, there's no telling exactly what  Oh.
Talk to your neighbor about their cat.
Or you're not gonna have any bric-a-brac left.
Goodbye, major.
Thank you so very much.
Uh Don't you worry about this bottle.
I'll bring it back If I could talk to you Goodbye, major.
Enjoy your day.
Ye Ow!
You let that woman take my bottle!
W-well, what could I do?
You saw how she There was nothing I could do.
When she's through having a copy made, she's going to find you a wife.
Well Who could afford a wife?
I'm gonna spend my life paying for the stuff you broke.
What am I going to do without my bottle?
I don't know, Jeannie.
Blink up another one.
I do not want to blink up another one.
I want my bottle back.
You heard what she said.
She's gonna have a copy made.
It's gonna be ready in a couple of days.
And where will I sleep in the meantime?
Well, I don't know.
Uh.
Uh Look, look, look.
Look, nice drawer.
You'd be comfortable in there.
I do not want to sleep in a drawer.
Well, uh Here, look, look I think I will take in your bedroom.
But, mine?
Well, where would I stay?
In the drawer, master.
Oh, Jeannie, now Jeannie?
Jeannie!
There.
You will be nice and comfortable.
Wait a minute, Jeannie.
You don't expect me to sleep in here!
Yes, master.
And in the morning, I am sure you will have thought of a way to get my bottle back.
Now, wait one minute, young lady.
If you think you're gonna get away Hey, now, wait!
Jeannie!
Ahh!
Wait!
Oh.
Good morning, master.
Did you sleep well?
It's the most comfortable drawer I ever slept in.
Let me out of here, please.
Did you figure out a way to get my bottle back?
Yes, I did.
Ooh!
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna call Salvatori & Sons, and tell them to have the duplicate bottle finished by tonight.
And then on my way home from work, I'll pick it up.
Oh!
What time are you going to pick it up?
About 7:00.
Oh.
Oh, I cannot wait.
Oh, master, I will go down there and get into the bottle, and wait for you, and you can pick both of us up at the same time.
Uh, n-no.
I don't think that's a terribly good idea, Jeannie.
Please.
No, I'm afraid not.
Please.
No, really.
Please, please, please, please?
All right, it's against my better judgment.
But be careful.
Oh, yes, master!
Okay.
I'm gonna go get dressed.
Uh, would you?
Would you fix?
Look at that.
No one can tell one from the other.
Hm.
Oh, here, here.
Just a little bit here.
Aha.
Now we wrap them and, uh, I'm gonna deliver them to Mrs. Bellows, huh?
Yes, Papa.
Oh.
I appreciate your coming along.
It should take a couple of minutes.
How do you get yourself into these things?
Can I help you?
Oh, yes.
I'm Anthony Nelson.
I believe you have a bottle here for me.
Ah, yes, yes.
I just finished the duplicate for Mrs. Bellows.
That's it.
You want to see it, huh?
Uh, no.
I'm in kind of a hurry.
A friend of ours is waiting for us to pick her up.
Oh.
I see.
All right.
Then I'll bring here your bottle, huh?
Gino!
Yes, Papa.
You bring here the original bottle for Mr. Nelson.
Yes, Papa.
Thank you.
Uh, you know, it takes a little time, but it comes out so perfect.
I'm proud of myself.
Oh, good.
Here you are.
Thank you very much.
I'm just going to deliver Mrs. Bellows' bottle.
Oh, good.
Tell her I hope she enjoys it.
Good night, and thanks again.
Good night.
No.
No!
No, you've got the wrong bottle!
Oh, master!
Master, no!
Help!
Help!
Boy, I'll bet Jeannie can't wait to get out of that bottle.
Yeah.
There we are.
Come on out, Jeannie.
Well, I guess she likes it so much, she doesn't want to leave it.
Come on, Jeannie.
Come on out.
Jeannie?
Say, you don't think that we could've gotten the wrong bottle, do you?
Of course.
Of course it's the wrong bottle.
There's not even any furniture in there.
You know You know what this means?
Dr. Bellows has the bottle, and Jeannie's inside of it.
I have an uncle in the insurance business.
Maybe he could get jobs for both of us.
I'll get it back.
Amanda, we're gonna be late.
It's very neurotic of you.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
You know, you're very compulsive about being prompt.
That isn't healthy.
Amanda.
Oh.
Who now?
Dr. Bellows.
Oh, uh, hello, Dr. Bellows?
This is Major Nelson.
How are you this evening, sir?
Oh, I'm just fine, thank you, major.
What can I do for you?
Uh, I went over to Salvatori's and, uh, picked up my bottle.
I got the wrong one.
I think you have the original.
Oh?
As a matter of fact, it was just delivered.
We haven't even unwrapped it yet.
Good, good.
I'll be right over and pick it up, sir.
Oh, I'm sorry, major.
But we're just on our way out to a dinner party.
Well, I-I can be there in 10 minutes.
Well, there won't be anyone here, major.
Uh, but, sir, I've got to have that bottle tonight.
Well, look, uh does it matter whether it's tonight or tomorrow?
It's just a bottle, isn't it?
Oh.
Well, y-yes.
Yeah, it Then I'll see that you get it tomorrow.
Now, is there anything else?
No, I can't think of anything, sir.
Then good night, major.
Good night.
Hm.
Oh, uh I forgot to tell you, darling, the, uh Mr. Salvatori just delivered the bottle.
Oh, I can't wait to see what it's like.
Uh-uh-uh.
You can wait until tomorrow.
We're late.
Come on Oh, darling.
The major was very awfully anxious about his bottle.
I know.
I bet it's like a blanket to him.
You know?
It gives him a sense of security?
Amanda, leave the psychoanalyzing to me.
Hm?
We're late.
You're so upset about it.
He said he'd give you the bottle in the morning.
When they get back from the party, what's the first thing Mrs. Bellows is gonna do?
Take off her girdle.
Roger, she's going to open the bottle.
And guess who's gonna come out?
Well, I have another uncle in the real estate business.
We've got to get that bottle right away.
You said it was in Dr. Bellows' house.
Yeah, that's right.
Well, what are we gonna do?
How are we gonna get it?
We're gonna break in.
Oh.
No, we're not.
No, no.
Give me that.
Wait.
I'm not going to break in.
You're going to break in.
I'm not going to break in.
Get the flashlight.
Just carry this.
I know every time  Roger.
Roger, where are you?
I'm right here.
I know.
Look, can I make a suggestion?
What?
Let's go home.
I've never burgled a house before.
It makes me nervous.
You're not burgling anything.
We're just exchanging bottles.
And if Dr. Bellows catches us, he's gonna exchange us.
He can't.
He's out for the evening.
Yeah, I wish we were.
Shh.
Be quiet.
Lay down, lay down.
Come on.
What are you doing?
Wait.
Wait, wait, wait.
What are you gonna do?
Shh!
How you gonna get in there anyway?
A strip of celluloid.
Oh, good.
It'll trip the lock.
Oh yeah.
Trip the lock.
Shh.
Shh!
Let's go!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You check the windows on that side of the house, I'll check this side.
I'll check this side, you check that side.
That's what I said.
Check No, no, it's locked.
Oh, good.
Let's go.
We can't leave Jeannie here.
There's an open window up there.
Great, if you're you could just walk right through it.
Give me a lift, will you?
Best idea you ever had.
My car's down the street.
Roge.
Hold that.
Oh, wait a minute.
You're not gonna climb up there?
Oh, don't.
Watch out.
Shh.
Be careful.
Watch it, watch it.
Shh!
Tony, what are you doing?
Oh.
If Dr. Bellows catches us on his lawn, he's What?
TONY : Roger!
Roger!
What?
Dr. Bellows is out for the evening.
You stand by the front door, and I'll let you in.
Okay, come on in.
Roger.
It worked.
All right.
Come on.
Wait.
I just figured out we could get 10 years for this.
You take that side of the house, I'll take this side.
And a court-martial.
Huh?
Oh, go on.
And that's not all.
Yeah.
I hate leaving a party early.
I'm sorry, darling.
I can't help it if I've got a splitting headache.
I didn't say you could help it.
I merely said it was psychosomatic.
Why couldn't I have married a butcher?
Oh, come now.
Alfred.
Alfred, there's someone in the house.
We're being burglarized.
Go call the police.
While I go call the police, they could escape.
Well, wh-what are you gonna do?
I'm going in there.
Darling, you can't.
You could get yourself killed.
I can take care of myself, my dear.
Alfred, I didn't mean what I said about the butcher.
No guilty feelings, please.
Alfred!
Wh-where are you going?
I have a gun in the garage.
Uh, come with me.
Yahh!
Well, it's not in the study.
Hey, look, why don't we turn on some lights so we So we can see what we're doing, huh?
We don't want anybody to know we're in here, remember?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I remember.
Come on.
Yeah.
I once saw a movie where an innocent guy helped his friend break into a house to steal some letters.
What happened?
They were both machine-gunned to death.
Let's go.
Let's take one more look over here.
Now, wait a minute.
Come on.
Wait.
There it is!
Great.
Well, let's get her and get out of here.
Jeannie?
Oh!
I am in here, master!
Good.
What'd you do?
I just knocked over the Chinese checkers.
Well, pick 'em up!
Are you kidding?
Who wants to be neat at a time like this?
You want Dr. Bellows to know somebody's been in his house?
That's what I said.
Let's pick 'em up.
I'm gonna take them by surprise.
Hide somewhere until it's over.
All right.
Good luck.
And remember, Alfred, shoot first and ask questions afterward.
Hide.
Hide.
Hurry!
Ooh!
Oh!
I just lost some of my marbles!
Put your hands up and stay right where you are!
Major Healey.
What are you doing here?
Oh.
Oh, ask Ask Major Nelson.
He knows what we're doing here.
Major Nelson!
What are you doing?
Would you mind explaining to me what?
He's asleep.
Asleep?
Oh, sir, he can't be asleep.
That's impossible.
We just  Oh.
Oh, asleep!
Yes, sir.
He's asleep.
He's sleepwalking.
Yeah, well, you see, uh, Tony sleepwalked here.
That's And you came along to see that nothing would happen to him.
Oh, well, that's least I can do for my best friend.
Not so loud.
You'll wake him up.
Mustn't startle him.
Yeah.
Give me a hand with him, will you?
We may as well put him on the couch.
Yeah, easy.
Oh!
Oh, he's very heavy.
Yes, sir.
Ooh!
No, no, no.
Oh, he's a heavy sleepwalker.
Alfred?
Alfred, are you all right?
Oh.
Major Healey, Major Nelson.
What?
What are they doing here?
Major Nelson is sleepwalking.
He's been sleepwalking.
Sleepwalking.
In our house?
Why?
Well, uh, I'm glad you asked that.
You see, uh We, uh When he was a little boy, he used to walk Well, it's really quite obvious.
You see, Major Nelson came here because he wanted his bottle.
Yeah, well, I knew you'd find out sooner or later.
You see, our problem is And it was preying on his mind.
Preying on his subconscious.
Why, it's the old classic case.
You know, I bet I can tell you exactly what happened.
I wish you would.
Well after Major Nelson phoned me, he went to sleep.
But he couldn't sleep because the bottle was on his mind.
The compulsion to get it back was so strong that he got up, and then either phoned you or went to your house?
Either way.
And then you came here with him.
Hm.
Marvelous.
Oh, darling, however did you figure all that out?
My dear, I'm a psychiatrist.
Amanda.
But, uh what I must learn is why this bottle means so much to Major Nelson.
Uh well, sir, as I was saying, see, we had two bottles No, no, no.
The truth, Major Healey.
Yes, sir.
Well, you see, we had the two bottles, and we tried to get  Yes?
Major Nelson here.
Darling, he's waking up.
Now, there's nothing to be alarmed about, Major Nelson.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
You're in my house.
In your house, Dr. Bellows?
I knew he'd be surprised.
Have I been in some accident or something?
What?
Almost.
You've been walking in your sleep.
I've never done that before, sir.
Believe me, there's nothing to worry about.
Now, as you were saying, Major Healey?
We had these two bottles I feel awfully faint.
Do you have any water?
Of course.
Maybe something for a headache.
Of course.
You stay right there.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You just won the Academy Award.
Here we are.
Here we are, Major Nelson.
Oh, thank you, sir.
It's more than kind of you.
A little water?
Easy.
Easy.
I'll take that, Amanda.
You're too kind, Mrs. Bellows.
Oh, why, it's a very lucky thing we arrived when we did.
Yeah, we're lucky.
How's your headache?
Oh, fine, it's I think it's getting better.
I-I ought to be leaving now.
I'm sorry to have intruded like this.
You brought the copy to exchange.
Yes, sir.
Let's exchange it.
We don't have to tonight.
Well, of course, tonight!
Otherwise, you'll be walking in your sleep again.
And the next time you might get shot.
Now, there you are, major.
Your problems are all over.
You'd better get to bed now.
You've been through a lot.
A lot, sir.
We've all been through a lot.
I'll take this.
Now major I don't mind keeping this till the evening.
No, it's all settled.
Alfred?
You know, I am sorry I started this whole thing.
Major, I should've taken the couch.
The couch?
Oh, yes.
The flowers are theirs.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Now, major, everything is all set.
All you have to do is relax.
I'm terribly sorry.
And then you get a good night's rest.
But wouldn't you like that?
A good night's rest, major.
Uh-uh.
Uh.
Good night.
Alfred Oh is he always like that?
Oh, no.
This is one of his good days.
Ooh?
Roger, do me a favor, will you?
Tomorrow morning, call your uncle in the real estate business.
Ask if he's got any openings.
What are you so worried about, anyway?
What am I worried?
Give me that.
Careful.
Ah.
Be careful.
You have any idea what's going on at Doctor Bellows' house right now?
No.
What?
Mrs. Bellows is opening that package.
And right about now, she's opening the bottle.
And you know what's coming out of the bottle?
Smoke.
And do you know what that smoke is turning into?
Jeannie.
That's what it's gonna turn into.
J-Jeannie?
!
Master!
Hey.
How did you get here?
I do not know.
Well, the old mastermind decided we needed a miracle, so when you were talking, I switched the bottles.
Oh, Major Healey.
Thank you!
Well Oh.
Oh!
Oh, oh, oh.
My own bottle!
Oh.
And my own genie.
Oh, you shouldn't have.
Ho-ho-ho.
You know better than to give Roger his own bottle, much less his own genie.
Open it.
Oh.
Boy Oh!
Oh.
Oh-ho-ho!
Whoo!
Oh!
It's champagne.
Oh.
Thank you.
Mm.
Well, at least we got Jeannie back.
I guess we might as well drink to it.
Oh.
Is that really champagne?
Sure is.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- Good evening, Major Healey.
- Hi, Jeannie.
Very good.
Where's Tony?
Tony!
I have not seen Major Nelson since early this morning.
Well, that's not like him to be late.
- We've got a dinner date.
I'm starved.
- I do not understand.
He has never been this late without calling me before.
You're a little slow.
You know, something funny is going on.
Something funny?
No, not that kind of funny.
He's been in a secret conference with a lot of senators and generals.
And he did not tell you what it was all about?
I haven't had a chance to get to him.
Oh, well, you do not think anything is wrong, do you?
No.
What could go wrong?
The only thing- - Hello, everybody.
- Oh, good evening, master.
- We we're worried about you, master.
- Well, I got- I got tied up.
If we're going to dinner, we'd better make it early.
We gotta be at the simulator tomorrow at 6:00.
- I won't be there, Roge.
- What do you mean, you won't be there?
I've just come from General Peterson.
I'm not in the space program anymore.
Do you mean you're no longer an astronaut, master?
- That's right, Jeannie.
- I can't believe it.
- They can't do that to you.
- Oh, they didn't do it.
I did it.
- You mean, you resigned?
- That's right.
I can't believe it.
Why would you wanna do a thing like that?
I'll wash up and we'll go out to dinner.
I'd rather not discuss it tonight.
You don't wanna discuss it.
Being an astronaut's the most important thing in your whole life.
You quit the program just like that.
You don't wanna discuss it.
Okay.
Let's just not discuss a thing.
Forget the whole thing.
I'm your best friend.
You don't wanna discuss it?
Tell you what.
You can discuss the whole thing without me together.
Don't need me.
I don't need you.
Major Healey seemed very upset.
Yeah, he is a little shocked, isn't he?
Well.
You really do not have to go back to Cape Kennedy, master?
No, Jeannie.
Oh, that is wonderful, master.
The first thing we will do is take a trip around the world.
What colour yacht would you prefer, master?
And would you rather travel east to west or west to east?
East to west.
Or west to east.
We're going to go to Columbus, Ohio.
What is a Columbus, Ohio?
It's a city, Jeannie.
I haven't retired, I've got a new job.
What kind of a job?
Well, I'm gonna head up a company that makes booster rockets for missiles.
And you would rather do that and live in Columbus than be an astronaut?
It's not a question of what I'd rather do.
- It's that I couldn't turn it down.
- Well, why not?
Because three senators and four generals asked me to take it.
It seems that the man who was in charge retired and there was no one else to take his place.
Well, if it makes you happy, it makes me happy.
Oh, yeah.
Why shouldn't I be happy?
I'm gonna be vice president in charge of production.
Vice president?
Columbus, Ohio.
Oh, I am pleased that they named a city after my friend.
The booster rockets are very important to the space program.
Columbus was such a nice man.
Did you know that he used to get seasick?
The other man considered besides myself was a Professor Lakewood.
He turned it down because his wife won't leave Connecticut.
He should never have been a sailor.
It's the biggest break of my life.
I'll have a huge salary and two secretaries and I should be the happiest guy in the world.
Good.
Shall we go out to dinner now, master?
No, thank you, Jeannie.
I'm not hungry.
I think I'll go to bed early.
Oh, would you mind, please?
Thank you.
Good night.
Oh, Major Nelson.
- Yes, sir.
- Come in.
Come in, come in.
I just heard the news.
Is it true?
Are you really leaving NASA?
Oh, yes, quite true, sir.
I can't believe it.
I thought I knew you as well as I know any man in this world.
And I'd bet my last dollar you'd never give up being an astronaut.
Well, you know how it is, sir.
When a big opportunity comes along, you can't let it slip through the fingers.
I just came in to pick up a few papers and things of mine.
I'll miss you on that world cruise.
- I'm not going on any world cruise, sir.
- No, no, no, I am.
Mrs. Bellows has been after me for some time to do this.
I couldn't leave before, of course but now that you're leaving, I'm resigning.
Well, I don't understand, sir.
Major Nelson, I planned to resign and go back into civilian practice two years ago.
But then you arrived and I couldn't tear myself away.
Oh, I see.
The first thing I am going to do is take a year off and write a book about you.
I've been taking quite a few notes.
Oh, yes?
I am gonna make you famous, major.
Well, I really don't wanna be that famous, sir.
Well, you can hardly avoid it.
In some manner I don't understand, you've been touched by fate.
By fate?
Oh no, it's not by fate.
I can assure you- I'm sorry.
Well, I'm sorry to be losing track of you.
I keep feeling I'm on the verge of discovering what there is about you.
Oh, well, I'm sure our paths will cross again.
Goodbye, major.
- Goodbye, sir.
- And good luck.
Thank you.
Hi.
Oh, hi, Roge.
It's nice.
Yeah, it's a tie.
Oh, congratulations.
On what?
Oh, I just heard the news about your new civilian job.
Yeah.
Well, when you get a big opportunity like this - you can't let it- - Slip through your fingers.
- Yeah, that's it.
- You're gonna be vice president - in charge of production.
- Yeah, that's right.
Roge, the reason I took the job is- Look, you don't have to explain it to me.
Two secretaries, a big office.
I mean, you'll be having a ball.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
I'll still be in the space program.
That's the important thing.
You'll be behind a desk and I'll be here.
- Roge.
- What?
I don't need this thing anymore.
Why don't you take it, huh?
Well, we'll probably be running into each other all the time.
- There's no use saying goodbye.
- Sure, I'll see you again.
- Well, okay, I'll probably see you then.
- Okay.
Roge.
I probably will need the cord.
Well I can't go through with it, General Peterson.
We've been through this before.
You don't wanna leave.
I don't want you to leave.
Washington feels you can do a more important job running a missile plant and that's that.
- Couldn't you tell them you don't- - No, I can't.
You heard them.
They want you and I'm under orders to deliver you.
Now, if I could find a way to keep you here, don't you think I would?
- Yes, sir.
- Well, I'm sorry, Tony.
We've both given our word and that's final.
- Yes, sir.
- It's not gonna be as bad as you think.
You'll find out how the other half lives.
A little luxury never hurt anybody.
The last thing I need in the world is luxury.
I just turned down a cruise on my own yacht.
- What?
- Oh, well, it's nothing, sir.
Isn't there a chance that you could call somebody and- The subject is closed, Tony.
All you can do is make the best of it.
I'm gonna miss you.
I'll miss you too, sir.
And NASA.
Fire!
I'm so upset.
- You're upset?
- I'm worried about Major Nelson.
Oh, you mean the tycoon.
Don't worry about him.
He's got it made.
From now on, it's go, go, go with martinis and golf balls.
Oh, no, he's very unhappy.
- Can you not do something?
- Well, if you could just get him - to change his mind.
- How?
How?
Wait a minute.
We know he won't be happy unless he's an astronaut, right?
Right.
And he certainly won't be happy sitting behind a desk.
- Oh, that is right.
- Well, then, why can't he see it?
If there's only some way to get him to look into the future.
Oh, but he can.
That is easy.
That's easy.
That- You mean you can show him what it's like?
- Of course.
- Well, Jeannie, that's wonderful.
One look at his new job and he'll turn it down, just like that.
Let's go and show him, huh?
Oh, wait a minute.
How bad is it?
Well, I do not know.
Would you like to see it?
Yeah, we'd better take a look at it first.
No use shattering his ego too much.
Pick his worst day.
His worst day.
Hey, look at that.
Oh, what is it?
Hey, how does it work?
- Well, first you put a drachma in.
- Oh, a drachma, yeah.
A drachma.
- Now turn the handle.
- Okay.
Oh, that is too slow.
- Oh.
- A bit faster.
No, no, no.
Not too fast.
Just, just That is better.
Mr. Nelson.
Hey, that is better.
Would you like to sign this?
Just a moment, Jane.
Ellen.
Ellen.
Oh, terrific.
Well, thank you, thank you.
- Did Miss Brooks call?
- Oh, yes.
She'd love to have lunch with you.
Her chauffeur will pick you up.
Oh, you have a terrace table at the country club.
Oh, and your theatre tickets are all set for this evening.
Oh, good, thank you.
My pleasure.
Oh, Jane.
- Ellen.
- Ellen.
Thank you.
Mr. Nelson.
Here's the report you asked for.
Thank you, Sue.
Oh, I see production's up Yes, and it's all due to you.
It's a team effort.
Please remember that I'm on your team.
I'll try to remember.
Oh, General Peterson is waiting to see you.
General Peterson?
Well, show him right in.
- General Peterson.
- Thank you.
Tony.
Martin, what brings you to Columbus?
I flew in to see you.
I wanted to tell you what a great job you're doing.
- Thank you very much.
- We're all proud of you.
It's a team effort.
How's Roger?
He's fine.
Sent his regards.
Sue, I've signed those contracts.
I wanna get them out in the early mail.
Well, it's quite a set-up you got here, Tony.
- Yes, it's a team effort, as I said.
- Yeah, I can see that.
I told you it wouldn't be so bad, once you got yourself adjusted.
Yes, I'm trying to get- I don't find it easy.
It's time for your massage, Mr. Nelson.
Well, I won't detain you.
Keep up the good work, Tony.
Feel free to drop in anytime, Martin.
I wouldn't want to interrupt your schedule.
Shall we go to work, Tony?
- What happened?
- It needs another drachma.
Well, give me another one.
I am out of drachmas.
You're out of drachmas?
At a time like this, you're out of drachmas.
Listen, is that what an average day is like?
- Yes.
- And that's his worst day?
Yes.
Would you like me to show you a good day?
No, I'd like you to show me where I can get a job like that.
My goodness, we have to get it back on again.
Shall we show Major Nelson what his new life will be like?
Oh, we show him that, we'll never get him to stay.
No, we're gonna have to think of something else.
His first secretary should've worn a veil.
Yeah, she should've worn a veil.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You want Tony Nelson to be happy, don't you?
- You know I do.
- And he's not going to be happy unless he's an astronaut.
Yes.
What do you want me do to?
Lie a little.
- Good evening, master.
- Oh, hi, Jeannie.
- Packing, huh?
- Yeah, yeah.
- I think I found a buyer for the house.
- Oh, that's great.
- I've grown very fond of this place.
- Yeah, me too.
Well, just think how exciting it will be living in Columbus, Ohio.
Yeah.
- I wonder what your life will be like.
- I don't know.
- I can show you if you like.
- Show me what?
Would you like to see you in your new job?
No, not particularly.
You mean, you wouldn't like to see what it's like in a typical day in the future, say, a year from now?
- Could you do that?
- Of course.
Well, it might be kind of interesting.
Oh, yes, you're gonna be very happy, huh?
Shall we show him his new job?
There.
- Here, take a look at this.
- Now I will put a drachma in.
- What is it?
- I thought you're all out of drachmas.
What is this?
Well, it's- Well, just turn the handle there, you'll- Watch very closely, master.
Not too fast.
Sally.
There.
Just a minute.
What do you want?
Would you make me some fresh coffee, Sally, please?
These have gotta get out tonight.
Can't it wait until the morning?
It's after midnight.
Look, as far as I'm concerned, I don't care if they get out at all.
You think I like working these hours?
I got a life of my own, you know.
Yeah, I know that, Sally.
Maybe tomorrow we can finish early.
It would help if they had somebody in your job who knew what he was doing.
Your phone is ringing.
Hello.
Oh, yes, sir.
You're gonna cancel the order?
You can't do that now, sir.
I know we were supposed to have it out last night but one of our machines broke down.
Well, I'll have it out first thing in the morning.
Yes- Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, please.
Help.
Here's some more cancellations.
- More cancellations?
- Oh, and here's your dinner.
I just got a call from the foreman.
Oh, yeah?
Is the number one machine-?
Is the number one machine fixed?
- Yes.
- Oh, good, good.
But number two and three are out.
I want a raise.
Yeah, that figures.
Oh, go on in.
Nelson.
Hey, General Peterson- Yes, sir?
What brings you to town?
I came down here to find out what's going on.
I know we're a little behind in the booster rocket deliveries- A little behind?
I think you're deliberately sabotaging us.
Why, this is the worst defence plant in the country.
I'm asking for a congressional investigation.
A congressional investi- Well, sir, we're having a little trouble with our equipment but we're having it fixed.
We're working around the clock.
Don't bother.
We just cancelled all your defence contracts.
Oh, sir, you can't do that.
Give me a chance.
- We'll get them out as soon- - I gave you a chance, Nelson.
- You let me down.
- Yeah, but general, look, if you just- The number one machine has broken down again.
And if Aggie gets a raise, I want a raise.
- You want a raise.
- You heard it, buster.
You big idiot!
- Here.
- Fix it.
I'm gonna fix it?
I gotta fix it?
Is it really gonna be that bad?
- Oh, yes, master.
- Oh, that's terrible.
I knew you'd hate it.
Did you see the office and the secretaries?
I never thought it's gonna be that bad.
I knew it'd shake you up.
Now you know it- I'm gonna get down there as fast as I can and straighten things out before they cancel the contract.
This could set the space program back 10 years.
He would not be in this trouble if it were not for that Professor Lakewood's silly wife.
Yeah, it was all his silly wife's fault.
Who?
The wife of the other man they wanted for the job.
Major Nelson said he refused it.
Because of his wife?
Yes, she has a home in Connecticut and she does not want to leave it.
- That's it.
- That is what?
That's the person we're gonna work on, his wife.
Oh, but if she loves her home, how can I make her leave it?
Yeah.
Oh, if you loved your home, what would make you leave it?
- You mean-?
- Yeah.
That's the most incredible thing I ever heard.
No, Tony's on his way over here now.
I'll talk to him and get back to you.
Poor woman.
Come in.
Tony, come in and sit down.
Thank you, sir.
Hey, Tony, how do you really feel about this job you're taking over?
Oh, I consider it a great opportunity, sir.
A challenge anyone would be proud of.
- Between us.
- I hate it.
How would you like to stay where you are?
- You mean I don't have to go?
- It's up to you.
You can have the job if you want.
But I ought to tell you.
I had a call from Professor Lakewood.
He'll take the job if you don't want it.
I understood his wife didn't wanna leave her house.
- She was driven out by snakes.
- Snakes?
It's the most incredible thing you ever heard of.
She was getting into bed, the snakes came up the stairs and into her room.
He says there were thousands of them.
Anyway, she refused to set foot in the house again.
If you don't mind giving up a big job and a big salary- - And two secretaries.
- Two secretaries.
- your place on the space program is still open.
- Major.
- Oh, yes, sir.
I've just heard the news.
Is it true?
Oh, that's right.
I'm not going.
But I'll certainly miss you.
I hope you enjoy your cruise.
- Cruise?
- Yes.
Do you think I'll leave you here alone?
Oh, no.
If you're staying, I'm staying.
I'll just go and get back my resignation.
No, no, no, I'm leaving.
Oh, yes.
Oh, I see you're unpacking.
Oh, yeah.
I guess you haven't heard the news.
- News?
- Yeah, I'm not going.
You're not going- Well, what happened?
Oh, well, there was this Professor Lakewood.
- He had a wife who wouldn't leave- - Hello, master.
I am ready to leave for Columbus, Ohio.
We're not going to Columbus.
We're staying here.
We are?
What happened?
Well, this professor and his wife were driven out of the house by snakes.
The snakes ran up to the bedroom and she came out screaming.
Roger, how do you know all that?
- A lucky guess?
- Jeannie.
- I have some housecleaning to do.
- Did you send those snakes to her?
Please do not be angry, master.
I only did it to help you.
- Don't be angry, you're asking- - Wait, don't blame her.
It was my idea.
I guess we shouldn't have butted in in the first place.
Well, if you hadn't have, I'd never have forgiven you.
Do you mean that?
Of course I do.
Oh, master!
Oh, does he not look handsome!
Oh, welcome back.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm sorry you're busy tonight.
Yeah, yeah.
Well, maybe some other time then.
Yeah, bye.
Nice talking to you.
Any luck, Roge?
Well, everyone's got a date tonight.
- Know how busy Monday nights are.
- Yeah, yeah.
Do you mind if just the three of us go to dinner tonight?
- Oh, of course not.
- No, fine.
Yeah.
Hey, wait a minute.
Do you know that cute little secretary, the one without the veil, with the- - Oh, yes.
- Well, I was wondering if she's not doing anything tonight, maybe you could: Is it all right, master?
I don't know, I haven't seen her but if it's all right with Roger, it's okay with me.
She's beautiful.
You'll love her.
Oh, just- - Would you mind Jeannie, just-?
- Of course.
I'm used to getting picked up at my place.
I hope we don't go to some cheap restaurant.
I'm all dressed up and I wanna go someplace nice.
I spent 29.50 on this dress and I don't wanna waste it.
After dinner, I wanna go dancing.
I hate a cheap date who won't take you dancing.
The last fellow I went out with insisted that we go to some crummy place.
We ended up
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Yeah, Tony Nelson, here.
Oh, Tony, you still asleep?
Yeah, my alarm clock didn't go off.
Oh, what happened?
Well, Jeannie smashed it last night.
Why would she want to do a thing like that?
Because I came in a little after midnight, and she thought it was late.
Well, listen, forget about Jeannie.
I just had a phone call that's going to make your whole day and your evening.
Yeah?
Remember those two gals we had a date with last month?
You mean Miss Atom Bomb and Miss Galaxy?
Yeah.
Well, I just had a phone call from them, and they want to go out with us tonight.
How about that?
Uh, well, I I can't go out with them, Roge.
You remember the last time I tried to date them?
You remember what she turned them into?
Yeah.
Boy, she's pretty hard to handle, isn't she?
She's impossible.
I I mean, it's getting so I can't call my life my own.
I'm almost sorry I picked up that bottle on the beach.
That's too bad.
I guess I'll have to find somebody else then.
Look, I'll, uh I'll see you at the base, okay?
Uh, yeah, yeah.
Good morning, master.
How are you feeling this morning?
Uh, to tell the truth, I'm not Here is your breakfast.
All of your favorite dishes.
Oh.
Well, uh, Jeannie, thanks a lot Look I don't Miss Atom Bomb and Miss Galaxy are in town.
I'm not gonna get involved.
Honestly, you don't have to I have pressed your dinner jacket, and you and Major Healey are going to take them out tonight.
And I am going to stay in my bottle, so that I will not accidentally cause you any trouble.
Hm.
I do not want anything to spoil this evening for you.
Wh Uh, what made you change your mind?
Oh, I have not changed my mind.
All I want is for you to be happy.
That is all I have ever wanted.
Oh.
They are such beautiful girls.
Oh.
You will have a wonderful time tonight.
Well, I will get back into my bottle.
Enjoy your breakfast, master.
I will see you tomorrow.
Hold it.
Hold it?
Yeah, I want to discuss this.
Oh, well.
Discuss what, master?
Oh, uh, breakfast in bed.
Uh Uh, you wanting me to go out with Miss Atom Bomb.
Uh, you staying in your bottle and not bothering me all day.
And being so terribly nice about everything.
That's what I want to discuss.
Oh, well, of course, master.
Why?
Uh, why?
Uh, when you start repeating everything I say, I know that I'm in trouble.
Now, what's going on?
Uh, going on?
Jeannie.
Well, I mean I mean, well Well, what could be going on?
I don't know.
That's what I want to find out.
Find out?
Let's see.
Now, I, um I know it's not my birthday.
And it's certainly not your birthday No.
But it's some kind of a special day, isn't it?
Well, it A very little day.
Uh-huh.
Now, look Oh, well, it It is, uh Haji's Day.
Oh.
I see.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Where are we getting?
The Ha-Haji is the, uh, master of all the genies.
Oh, I see.
I see.
And on Haji's birthday, you act especially nice.
You guessed it, master.
Have a wonderful time.
I will see you tomorrow.
Yeah Hold it.
Why do I keep feeling like there's something more?
Oh.
I cannot imagine, master.
But there is.
Well yes, but it It It is such a tiny little thing, I did not even want to bother you with it.
Bother me.
Well this will amuse you.
Yeah, amuse me.
Go ahead.
Well each year on Haji's birthday all the masters who are unhappy with their genies are able to send them away for good.
Oh, is that not ridiculous?
Jeannie, let me get something straight.
If I send you away, you have to go?
Well, I know it is ridiculous, but But I can?
Well, I I-I know you would not even dream of doing such a thing.
No.
No, of course not.
Yeah, what time do I have to let you know?
You have until midnight.
Midnight.
Oh, but do not even think about it, master.
I'll be good.
I will grant your every wish.
And I will stay in my bottle and not get you into any trouble.
You may go out with all the beautiful girls you want to Okay.
and there is no Okay.
You mean it is all right?
No.
I mean, I want to think about it.
Oh, you wish to think about it?
I mean, uh, how often does Haji have a birthday?
Do you mean, you can get rid of Jeannie if you want to  just like that?
Yeah  just like that.
I only have until midnight.
Oh, she wasn't going to tell me, you know.
I had to drag it out.
Oh, if she hadn't been so nice to me, I wouldn't have gotten suspicious.
Hm.
Well, uh, what are you, uh What are you gonna do?
I don't know.
I think I'm gonna have to send her away.
Well, why would you want to do a thing like that?
Roger, I don't want to do that, but I don't have any choice.
Ever since I've met her, I've been in trouble.
Boy, am I gonna miss her.
So am I. Well, she can't help being the way she is.
Oh, I know that.
She's a She's a warm-hearted beautiful, impetuous, troublemaker.
That's what she is: A troublemaker.
Hello, master.
Hi, Jeannie.
How many times have I told you not to pop in in public places?
Oh, nobody is looking.
Yeah.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Good morning, Jea Jeannie.
Get a chair.
Get a chair.
Get a chair, get a chair I got a chair.
Get a chair.
Get a chair.
I am sorry to bother you, master, but you left your briefcase at home, and I thought you might need it.
Well, thank you, Jeannie.
You shouldn't have troubled.
Oh, nothing is too much trouble for you, master.
Anytime, anyplace.
There aren't too many genies who feel that way.
And my only wish is to make you happy.
I know you do, Jeannie.
And And you've been wonderful, and we've had a great year.
But I've come to a decision, and I think I I-I-I had better go home and see if you left anything else.
Oh, Jeannie Jea Boy, oh, boy.
How could you do it?
Do what?
Make her leave?
Well, Roger, I can't let her go on running my life.
Well, when does she ever run your life?
Wha What kind of a memory do you have?
Do you remember the time, uh when she, uh She thought I looked tired, and I needed a rest?
She made every day Sunday.
I remember I I I walked into the living room one day and I Do you Do you know what kind of chaos this could create?
I only know that you have been working too hard, and it is not good for you.
Now Jeannie It is no use talking about it, master.
This is for your own good.
It is going to remain Sunday until you have rested.
Hm.
It will give you a chance to do all those things you enjoy.
I'm not gonna enjoy anything, and I'm not gonna let you do this.
I'm gonna put my foot down   Jeannie!
Try it on.
No.
Jeannie, will you stop fooling around.
I'm telling you for the last time Jeannie!
Jea Ohh!
Jeannie!
You remember that?
Yeah, I'd forgotten that.
It was pretty funny.
Yeah, Dr. Bellows almost caught me.
That wasn't very funny.
Master?
Oh, Jeannie, what are you doing here?
Well, I Oh, I'm s I'm sorry.
What are you doing, anyway?
What are you?
Oh!
Yeah.
Say, what have you done to yourself?
Well, I I thought you might prefer me with dark hair.
No, I like you just the way you were.
Oh, did you, master?
Yeah.
Thank you!
I will go tell Haji.
Uh, no, that's not what I had in mind.
Oh boy, it's pitiful.
She'd do anything to please you.
Well, do you think I'm gonna enjoy sending her away?
It's just, I I can't take a chance on keeping her.
Well, if you send her back to the Haji, you'll never see her again, ever.
Yeah, that's right.
Why don't you give her another chance anyway?
She said she wouldn't get you into any more trouble.
Well, it's not only me.
You remember the things she's done to you?
Hey, she's never done anything to me.
Roger, do you remember the time I got hit on the head and got amnesia?
Oh, yeah.
And I I forgot who Jeannie was.
And I fell in love with her?
Yeah.
She wanted to marry you.

You can't have Jeannie back.
There's, um, been some kind of a mistake.
Something went wrong with my watch.
Now, it's up to me to decide if I want to send her back.
And I've decided I do not want to send her back.
Are you listening?
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll fight you for her.
But I warn you, I'm trained in unarmed combat.

{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Good morning, Major Healey.
Hi, Jeannie.
Uh, where's Tony?
He asked me to pick him up.
Oh, he overslept.
Would you like a cup of coffee while you're waiting?
No, I'm in a hurry.
I Why?
Well, Friday is General Peterson's and, uh, well, Dr. Bellows wants to put on this show.
And I have to find somebody to take charge of the entertainment committee.
Oh, Major Nelson is very good at being in charge of things.
Well, it's not a matter of that.
You gotta know somebody that's in show business.
You gotta have somebody that has a big act.
He doesn't know anybody in show business at all.
I will help him.
Well, you co No.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
He doesn't like you helping him.
Don't do it.
How would it look if some other master's genie was in charge?
Yeah, I see what you mean.
No!
No, no.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
He would enjoy himself.
Forget Not me.
No.
He may not think so, but he would enjoy himself a great That's out.
Major Healey, if Major Nelson is not put in charge, I can promise you that on the night of General Peterson's party, there will be a terrible hurricane.
The night of the party?
And a tidal wave.
General Peterson's party?
And a typhoon.
And we'll all be sitting around having cocktails?
Hm.
Well, I guess that's it.
Ha-ha-ha.
I guess we found the new head of our committee.
Oh.
And, shh, not a word to Major Nelson.
Yeah, not a word.
Shh.
Yeah, not a word.
Oh, boy.
Guess I'll be Oh, hi, Roge.
I'm sorry.
I overslept.
Do you know something?
Huh, what?
You should've stayed in bed.
Frankly, Major Healey, I would never have thought of Major Nelson for this.
Ah, well, frankly, neither did I, sir.
It just came to me out of the blue.
Do you think he can get a top entertainer for Friday evening?
Well, if he can't, he knows someone who can.
Uh, he's really quite anxious to head the committee, though.
Oh, strange.
He never said a word to me about it.
Well, you know how modest Tony is.
But he'll come up with someone great.
Ah, Major Nelson.
Yes.
I just want to express my appreciation.
Your appreciation, sir?
For volunteering to take charge of General Peterson's party.
I haven't had a chance to tell you that For volunteering to take?
Uh, Major Healey told me how anxious you are to do it.
Oh, Major Healey told you that, did he?
Thanks.
We were considering using some of the amateur talent around here, but with all the people in show business you know, that won't be necessary, will it?
People in show business I I told you he's modest.
Ha-ha-ha.
I don't know one single person in the entertainment That's right.
Most of them are married.
Well, it's in your hands now, Major Nelson.
This is one of the most important evenings in General Peterson's life.
Oh, and, uh, may I just say one thing?
Yes, sir.
Don't let me down.
Yes, sir.
Why?
Well, if you're not the head of the entertainment committee during General Peterson's party, there's going to be a hurricane, a tidal wave and a typhoon.
Jeannie.
Jeannie did that?
Not so loud.
Shh.
Don't get her mad, now.
Wh-why would she make you do that?
Why?
How would it look if some other genie's master got the job?
I mean, all you have to do is get a great entertainer.
Oh, sure.
I don't know anybody in the entertainment field.
I just told Yeah, but Jeannie does.
Yeah, I'm sure she does.
I can just see her now.
Uh, uh, Shakespeare will come out and introduce Sarah Bernhardt, and then Ben Hur will do a little chariot race.
Yeah, yeah.
Wait a minute.
Then after Ben Hur, maybe some gladiators.
Wait a minute, you have the first act.
Oh.
You got the whole first act.
Now, I can't be the head of the entertainment committee.
Why not?
Yeah, why not?
I bet Jeannie knows a lot of people in show business.
Oh, yeah.
Of course.
I know hundreds, thousands.
Yeah?
Didn't I tell you?
What is show business?
Jeannie, you You volunteered me for For For this.
What do I do for entertainment?
Oh, that.
Yeah, that.
Well, we could start with a chariot race by Ben Hur and then some gladiators.
Well, I guess I better be running along.
Yeah, yeah.
A fine friend you turned out to be.
I really Are you very angry, master?
Why did you do this to me?
Well, I I thought you might like to do something nice for General Peterson.
Oh, I would.
I would.
But I don't know anything about entertainment.
Oh, well, I can get you.
Cleopatra's dancing girls.
Huh?
They are the most No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
I would like to help you Believe me, you've done enough.
Really.
Well, what will you do?
I'll go to Miami.
You're going to run away?
No.
I'm gonna go to Miami because a lot of big stars work down in Miami in hotels and nightclubs.
Maybe I can persuade one of them to come up to the space center.
Oh, you are brilliant, master.
Here we are.
Do you see anyone you know?
No.
But I see somebody I'd like to have.
Ah, he'd never do it.
Who would never do it?
One of the greatest entertainers in the world.
Sammy Davis Jr. Oh.
Is he better than Ben Hur?
Sammy Davis Jr.?
Do you think you can really get him?
Well, I don't know, Roge.
Um, he He's doing a show in a hotel in Miami.
I'm going down there tonight to see if I can talk to him.
Oh, you gonna take Jeannie?
Are you kidding?
She'll never let you go without her.
She's not gonna know about it.
How are you gonna manage that?
Well, don't worry about it.
I'll think of something.
There's Dr. Bellows.
I'll see you later.
Okay.
Good luck.
Oh, uh, here are some research books.
The new auditory charts.
I thought you and Major Nelson might like to look them over before the test tomorrow.
Well, I better look them over myself, sir.
I don't think he's going to be back.
You see, he went down to Miami.
May I ask why?
Well, he went to get Sammy Davis Jr. For General Peterson's party.
Sammy Davis Jr.?
You mean he's agreed to entertain for the general?
Well, sir, I didn't say that That Oh, that's marvelous.
I happen to know that he's.
General Peterson's favorite performer.
Well, it's not all set Wait until I tell the general.
Oh, I wouldn't Oh, he's going to be very pleased.

I know you're the boss, but you're gonna kill yourself.
George, if I gotta go, will you let it be in the key of G. Okay?
Let's sing.
Sammy, he's right.
If you don't rest, you're gonna have a nervous breakdown.
"Nervous breakdown".
That's all I ever hear from you.
Do me a favor and take care of the money.
Let me take care of the arrangements.
Come on, once again, huh, George?
Nice and light, now.
Yeah.
Can I help you?
Uh, yeah, I'd like to speak to Mr. Davis, please.
Sure.
One moment.
The girl from Ipanema Goes walking And when she passes Each time she passes I go Now, oh, oh, oh.
Can I help you?
It's not happening.
Oh, yes, I'd like to speak to Mr. Davis.
No, I'm sorry.
He's rehearsing.
Perhaps I could help you.
I'm his manager.
Oh, yes, certainly, um Well, I'd like to speak to him about the possibility of doing a performance at, uh, Cape Kennedy.
General Peterson is celebrating his 10th year as a general.
Oh, Sammy loves to do benefits.
Oh, good, good.
That's good.
But this is not exactly a benefit.
It more or less falls under the heading of "saving my life".
What night is it?
Oh, it's, uh, Friday night.
Uh, Friday night.
I could send a car down for him.
Oh, I'm afraid Sammy couldn't get away.
He does two shows a night here.
Oh, well.
Then maybe I could send a jet.
Mister.
Mister Well, unless you could postpone it.
Uh, until when?
Well, let's see.
Sammy's first free day is, uh, May 15th.
May 15th?
A year from May 15th.
He's booked solid.
Oh, I see.
Oh, oh, oh.
Well, thank you.
It was worth a try.
I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Well, who shall I tell him called?
Oh, uh, the late Major Anthony Nelson.
One time.
Here we go.
One, two, three, four.
Tall and tan And young and lovely The girl from Ipanema Goes walking And when she passes Each time she passes I go, "Ahhh" When she walks It's like the samba That sways so cool And swings so gentle That when she passes Each time she passes I go, "Ahhh" But I watch her so gladly H-h-h-how can I tell her I love her?
Gee, I would give My heart gladly But each day when she walks To the sea She looks straight ahead Not at me Tall and tan And young and lovely The girl from Ipanema Goes walking And when she passes I smile But she doesn't see She ain't looking at me  She ain't looking at me  She ain't looking at me It's not me That she will ever see Ah Well, it ain't the Monkees, but it'll have to do.
Hey, John and Michael, why don't you go get some coffee in the kitchen.
I know it took a long time, but you see?
Practice makes perfect.
Okay, Sam.
Oh, look, Sam.
Yeah?
You will try to get a little sleep before the show tonight?
Sure, I'll take a nap.
Don't worry about it.
And you go in the kitchen and eat, 'cause you need it.
Hey, guess who was just here to see you.
Sapphire and her mama.
You're close.
Oh.
Major Anthony Nelson.
The astronaut?
Mm-hm.
Well, where is he?
Oh, he He left.
I told him you were rehearsing.
Oh, come on, Jim.
You're puttin' me on, man.
If that cat's not too busy to go to the moon for me, then I'm certainly not too busy to stop a rehearsal and see him.
Well Now, find him for me, will you?
Thank you, Jim.
It was your goof.
Look at you.
Just look at you.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Your master is exhausted.
And do you know why he is exhausted?
Because he is worried.
And why is he worried?
Because I cannot get Sammy Davis Jr. for him.
You must do something about that.
Right.
Well, I can't get over that.
Hah.
How about that, huh?
Gee, I've met the queen of England, the president of the United States, and now I'm gonna meet a real live astronaut.
Oh, I I've heard of nervous breakdowns, but this is ridiculous.
Excuse me.
Heh.
A-are you the Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.?
Well, I I was a few minutes ago.
I'm not feeling well now.
Oh, there's nothing to be worried about.
Oh.
My master is very anxious to meet you.
Your master?
Mm-hm.
Excuse me, please.
Oh, and it looked so real too.
Master!
Oh, master!
Oh, master, I have some wonderful news News for you  He tricked me.
Oh.
I am terribly sorry, but my master is gone.
Hah, well, don't you worry about that, ma'am.
I I'm a little gone myself.
Well, it was It was nice meeting you.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
I'm sorry, Sam.
I couldn't catch Major Nelson.
Jim, George, piano.
I'm back.
Back where?
You know something?
You're right.
I've been working much too hard.
You know the Copa date?
Break it.
Break it?
Listen to me.
When I start to see harem girls and disappearing masters, then it's time for me to take a rest.
Now, you find me a sanitarium in the country somewhere where it's nothing but trees around, right?
Dig?
Do that!
Sammy, you're booked.
Jim, would you do me a favor and just do it!
Okay.
Dr. Mallard ought to be able to tell us where to go.
Yeah, I guess so.
How long do you wanna stay?
Oh, I don't know.
Three months.
Three months?
All right, make it a month.
You couldn't sit still for a month.
You know something, you're right.
You should make it a week.
A week.
Jim.
Jim, hold on.
Now, let's not get carried away, see?
Let's not put it too far out in the country.
Maybe we could find a little place that has a combo and a little dance floor, huh?
A sanitarium with a combo and a dance floor?
Sure, and on top of the roof, maybe a discotheque, where the chicks are doing the monkey and the boogaloo.
Boo-boo-ga-la-loo Hey, go-go girls?
Dance hall?
That sounds like the Copa to me, fellas.
Hey, you know somethin'?
George is right.
He's absolutely right.
Hang up the phone.
We'll keep the Copa date.
Can you imagine a man?
It is rather amusing, believe me.
I saw a harem girl, disappearing master.
It was so real to me.
Ah!
All right, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Jeannie.
Why did you sneak away, master?
Well, I, uh I had some personal business to take care of.
Through the window?
Yeah, well Well, while you were gone, do you know who was here?
I had to meet a man  Sammy Davis Jr. Well, how did you know?
Well, I-I-I just told you.
He He was here.
Oh, no, he couldn't have been here.
I just left him in Miami.
You?
You didn't bring him here?
Now, tell me you didn't.
Please, say you didn't bring him here.
Well, how did I know you were going to sneak out the window?
Would you like me to blink him back, master?
No, no.
It wouldn't do any good anyway.
He has two performances a night.
What will you do, master?
Well, I'll just have to get somebody else.
He's not the only entertainer in the world, you know.
Well, he may not be the only entertainer in the world, but he's certainly the greatest.
Yeah, Roger, it's It's not the entertainment that's the important thing.
It's the The spirit of the occasion that counts.
Hello, Tony, Roger.
Sir.
General.
Dr. Bellows told me what you're doing, and I just want you to know how much I appreciate it.
Oh, it's my pleasure, sir.
Well, this has got to be a great show.
Uh, yes, Roger and I were just talking about the entertainment, weren't we?
Well, it's not the entertainment that's important, Tony.
It's the spirit of the occasion that counts.
Yes.
Well, to think that the men would care enough to do a thing like this.
Well, that's the most important thing, sir.
Ha-ha.
You couldn't have done anything that would make me happier.
I first saw him the same day I got my first star.
Eh, saw who, sir?
Sammy Davis Jr. That's a day I'll never forget.
We went to see his show that night.
And when Dr. Bellows told me that you'd arranged to have him sing a number for me Friday night, it really brought a lump to my throat.
Ahem.
I'm a little choked up myself, sir.
I'll never forget this, Tony.
I can hardly wait till Friday night.
This could break General Peterson's heart.
Oh, master, why do you not think before you get into these things.
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I know.
Why do we not talk to Mr. Sammy Davis.
Ah, beca I told you, Jeannie.
He does two shows a night.
He's a very busy man.
When he's up on stage And I didn't even I I came   Oh, yeah.
It's happening again.
You're Major Nelson?
Yeah, that's right.
Don't worry about it, major.
We're both cracking up at the same time.
We're sharing the same nervous breakdown.
Oh, no, you are not having a nervous breakdown.
I will tell you I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.
Please, sit.
Yes.
Ahem.
Now, Mr. Davis, uh, this is not gonna be easy.

No, it's Ah, you both are putting me on?
Putting you?
Oh, no, no.
I'm not putting you on.
I Eh, well, I tell you I tell you what, major.
Suppose you don't even mention it to me.
Don't tell me what it is because it would only make me, see, so nervous I'd go out of my mind.
I don't have to tell you how top-secret this is.
Oh.
My lips are sealed.
Good.
Who is she?
Oh, I'm his My assistant.

Oh, well, thank you very much.
Well, we were wondering if you could do Maybe give a little performance for us.
Maybe a little number?
Oh, I spoke to Jim about that, and we tried to work it out, but unfortunately, it can't be done.
Well, I figured it out.
We could have a jet pick you up and Major, I would love to.
I really mean I'd love to be there, but unfortunately Well, let me put it this way.
If I could, I would.
Would you really?
Yes, of course.
I think I can arrange it.
Now Now, wait a minute.
Don't get involved.
Now, Jeannie.

{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
What is it?
What is it?
Jeannie!
What is it?
Oh, master, I am so frightened.
Calm down.
Just calm down.
How can I calm down when something terrible is going to happen?
What?
What's gonna happen?
I I am not sure exactly, but I had this t-terrible dream, and And then I woke up and Jeannie, Jeannie.
It was a nightmare.
A nightmare.
Now, you go You go back to your bottle and forget all about it.
It's just a dream.
Oh, that is what worries me, master.
My dreams always come true.
Oh!
Your?
Your dreams always come true?
Oh, yes, master.
Something terrible is going to happen.
Oh, no.
Now, don't worry.
You're gonna be fine.
You're gonna be fine.
Oh, I know.
Nothing is going to happen to me, master.
It is going to happen to you!
W-wait.
What's gonna happen?
Shh!
Let me do that, Jeannie.
Oh, I am sorry, master.
But I do not want to lose you.
Oh, you're not gonna lose me.
My dreams always come true.
Yeah.
Uh, Jeannie, exactly what did you dream about?
Well, I cannot remember exactly what it was.
Well, you must have some idea.
Uh, was it involving, uh, an automobile accident?
No, I do not think so.
An earthquake?
No.
A flood?
No.
Um, a slip in the shower?
No.
A volcano?
No.
Well, Jeannie, it must be something.
Mm-mm.
Hm!
An animal.
An animal?
Oh, it is all coming back to me now.
Yeah?
You are going to be attacked.
Attacked by what?
A cat.
A cat?
Oh, it was terrible.
It was huge and ferocious, and he was crouching over you, Don't do that.
Ready to eat you.
Stop playing around.
Oh!
And I was not there to protect you.
Uh, don't Don't worry.
I'm not gonna let anything like that happen.
But how can you help it?
Well, uh, that's very simple.
There aren't any wild animals in Cocoa Beach, are there?
Mm.
And, um, I won't put myself in a position where I'll meet any wild animals.
You see how simple that is?
Huh?
You're not worried anymore, are you?
Yes, master.
Huh?
Something terrible is going to happen to you.
I feel it in my bones.
I know this more than anything else in my whole life.
And I have lived a long time.
Hi, Tony.
Hey, look what I've got.
Three front row tickets.
Yeah, for what?
For the circus.
The circus?
Yeah, I haven't been there since I was a kid, and I thought maybe you and Jeannie and I, we could go I'm sorry, Roge, I No.
But don't you like circuses?
Do you know what they have at the circus?
Yeah, they have tightrope walkers and clowns and acrobats and And wild animals.
Yeah, wild animals.
Well, Jeannie had a dream last night that I was attacked by wild animals.
Oh.
Here's your ticket.
I'll have these exchanged for two back row seats.
You couldn't pay me to go to that thing.
Now that we know where the trouble could've come from, there's nothing to worry about.
Right.
Give me a screwdriver, will you, Roge?
Oh, thanks.
How's it look?
Well, the flanges are okay.
The main rotor head's the one that's gonna give us a problem.
Is everything all right?
Oh, yes, yes.
Everything's just fine.
You don't have to worry.
Oh, I hope you are right.
The circus is probably clear on the other side of town by now.
Oh, very well.
Then I think I will go shopping.
Good, good.
You do that.
Have fun.
Would you like to come with me?
No, no, I have to finish up this project.
What are you doing?
Well, I'm trying to miniaturize these parts.
Miniaturize?
Mm-hm.
Yeah, make smaller.
Why do you want them smaller?
Oh, well, one of the problems in sending up a missile is that you have to have hundreds of pounds of thrust for every payload pound you carry, you understand?
No.
Well, what Tony means is, if we can reduce the size of the parts, we can get more into the missile.
Oh, I see.
You mean, if that is tiny, then you will have more room for other things.
Yeah, well, something like that, yeah.
Oh, well.
I am sure you will be able to do it, master.
I remember once when King Tut wanted to build a dam across the Nile.
Everyone said that it could not be done Uh, Jeannie, why don't you go shopping?
Yes, master.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Here's that wiring diagram.
Do you know what that looks like?
That looks like the rotor's been miniaturized.
Jeannie!
Do you realize what she's done?
She's saved us a year's work.
Oh, she could miniaturize the whole missile.
Oh!
Oh, Tony.
Tony?
Tony.
I'm down here.
Down where?
Hi, I'm down here, Roge.
I'm down Hey, don't step on me.
Don't!
What are you doing down there?
She shrunk me.
She blinked at the rotor head and miniaturized it, and some of it spilled over on me.
Don't panic, so you're a little short.
Uh Uh Uh, go Go find Jeannie.
Well, she went shopping.
Well, go find Maybe she hasn't left yet.
Yeah, okay.
I'll look in the house.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Don't leave me here.
Don't get excited now.
Be careful.
Ahh!
You're squeezing me!
I'll take you with me.
Hold on.
You're in good hands.
Jeannie!
Jeannie?
Tony's in trouble!
You're shaking me.
Be careful, will ya?
You gotta help him!
Put me down.
Over there on top of the desk.
Now, careful.
Careful.
Okay, just sit right here.
Easy.
Easy!
Roger, she's gone.
You gotta find her.
Now, look, just take it easy.
Everything's gonna be all right.
What do you mean, all right?
Look what she's done to me.
Hey, maybe Jeannie's got something there.
Do you realize if she shrank a hundred astronauts, we could fit 'em into a capsule Roger!
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Just relax.
I'll go and get Jeannie.
And hurry!
Yeah, okay, but, uh, don't do any walking, huh?
If anybody stepped on you, you'd really be short.
Yeah, yeah.
Hello.
Anybody home?
Major Nelson?
It's Dr. Bellows.
Hide.
Uh, Major Nelson?
Well   Ah, Major Healey.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson's not here.
That's strange.
He asked me to stop by and pick up a chart he made for me.
Why would he do that?
Oh, yeah.
Well, he had to leave unexpectedly.
Well, I'll just wait here.
I wouldn't do that, sir.
Who knows when he'll be back.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll just phone my office and see if I can Oh!
Oh, I wouldn't do that, sir.
On second thought, he'll probably be right back.
You seem terribly nervous, major.
Oh Do you have a problem?
Well, just a tiny one, sir.
Really nothing, uh, worth mentioning.
It's Well, I'm glad to hear that.
Oh, don't move!
Don't move!
Don't move?
Why?
Stand still.
Why?
Oh, well, I, uh Ahem, I lost a crystal to my watch.
Oh, your crystal?
Well, I  I'll tell you what.
Why don't we tiptoe out on the patio, and we'll get a little suntan out there.
I don't want a suntan, major.
Look, do you happen to know where Major Nelson left that decompression chart?
I Oh, oh.
It's It's upstairs in the study.
Why don't we go up to the study?
It's probably there.
We'll just tiptoe up there.
Oh, very well.
Very nicely, watch out for the crystal.
Watch it, watch it, watch it.
Watch it.
Watch it, now.
That's it.
Easy does it.
Up to the study we go.
Watch out.
Oh, no.
Oh, no!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Ahh!
Well, I'm sure they're here somewhere, sir.
Well, it doesn't matter.
He'll tell us where they are when he returns.
Oh, wait a minute, sir.
We haven't looked in the In the desk yet.
Oh, I don't think we should be going through.
Major Nelson's desk, do you?
Well, I think he would like it that way.
He'd be very upset if he thought you were walking around in the living room.
Ah.
Well, um, uh, shouldn't we answer it?
It might be important.
It's probably the wrong number.
Oh!
I'll get it, sir.
It's the telephone.
Mm.
Ah.
Hello.
Hello, Major Healey.
Oh, boy.
Am I glad to hear from you.
I am having such fun shopping that I have decided to spend the whole afternoon at the market.
Well, uh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Oh, I am sure Major Nelson would not mind.
May I speak with him, please?
Well, uh, he can't reach the phone.
I mean, we can't reach him to reach the phone.
Ah, he's still working.
Was he pleased at what I did?
Well, uh, I don't think "pleased" is the word.
You see, he's feeling very low.
Feeling very low.
I know why.
He loves to do everything himself.
He never wants me to help him.
Well, I think you've over-helped him.
Well, if he is very unhappy, I will come right home now.
Oh, not now!
Oh Major, can we get on with this?
Oh, yes, sir.
I will Get on  Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Very well then.
I will spend the whole afternoon at the market.
You will not believe this, but I have found a two-for-one sale.
Bye-bye, Major Healey.
Oh!
Don't go!
Don't go H-hello?
Oh, she just hung up.
Jeannie!
Ow!
Ha, ha.
Jeannie!
Ahh!

Back, back!

Jeannie!
Look out, look out, look out!
You, you, you, you Look out!
Jeannie!
Stay away from me.
Back!
Back!
Back!
I knew they had to be here.
Wait a minute, sir.
What?
I'll go first, sir.
Oh, yes, the crystal.
Yeah, crystal.
Tippy-toe.
Well, uh, I'd better be getting back to the base.
Oh, uh, tell Major Nelson I have the chart, will you?
Yeah, well, he'll be glad you missed him.
I mean, he'll be sorry he missed you.
Hm.
Yes.
Oh, I did want to discuss this chart with him before I turned in it.
I know, I can go over it with you in my office.
Good idea, sir.
First thing Monday morning.
No, I meant now, Major Healey.
Well, I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
Major, General Peterson is waiting for it.
Did you have anything more important to do?
Huh?
Major, I asked you: Did you have anything more important to do?
Well, no, sir.
I'll I'll be right there, sir.
All right.
Oh, what a way to go.
If you're ready, Major.
Bye, buddy.
Hey, wait a minute!
Whoa!
Ah, whoa!
Ahh!
Jeannie, Jeannie!
Let me off this thing, will ya?
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Do something!
Turn this thing off, will ya?
Lady, would you mind not pinching the oranges.
But, how else can I tell whether they are ripe?
You buy them, and then you pinch them.
In Atlantis, we always pinch them.
Look, lady, this ain't Georgia.
Please keep your hands off the fruit.
How much are they?
Twenty-nine cents a pound.
Twenty-nine cents?
Why, that is robbery!
In Atlantis, the oranges are 10 times the size of these, and we only charge three teklas.
Look, lady.
I'm not running a debating society.
If you're not gonna buy anything, please move on.
Oh, no wonder you are so bad tempered.
You are ashamed of the poor merchandise you have to sell.
I will give you something you can be proud of.
Ah.
Now, here is a real orange.
You may pinch this if you like.
And I would suggest that you do not charge more than three teklas for that.
Goodbye.
Jeannie!
Oh, my  Whoa, wait a minute!
Hey, wait a minute!
Ahh!
Oh, no!
What is it?
Hey, help!
Help!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Well, Major, this test is most encouraging.
You spent over seven and a half hours under stress in the decompression chamber without any adverse psychological effects.
Well, I'm happy to say that you're completely normal.
Dr. Bellows?
Mm?
There's something I better tell you.
Yes?
I killed my best friend.
What are you talking about?
Major Nelson, sir.
You killed Major Nelson?
I should've done something, but I didn't know there was a cat in the house.
You didn't know there was a cat in the house?
No, sir, I was expecting a tiger.
A tiger?
We both were.
But the little cat ate him up.
It's It's hard to believe.
What are we gonna do?
I'll tell you what we're going to do.
We're going to start your test all over again.
Now, major.
Master?
Jeannie!
Master, I'm home.
Master, what are you doing playing with the cat?
What?
That is a terrible thing to do.
I told you cats were dangerous for you.
And so tiny.
You had no business to  Oh.
You're too late, Jeannie.
Too late for what?
D-Don't you know what happened to Tony?
Yeah, I know what happened to Tony.
Tony?
Tony!
Oh!
I didn't kill him!
Oh, oh, oh!
I didn't kill him.
I didn't kill him.
When I saw the cat licking his lips Why did you let him play with the cat?
You had no business letting him be so tiny and playing with the cat.
Why did Roger?
What do you mean?
I should always be here You were responsible for the whole thing.
We were in the garage minding our own business when you decided to shrink No, I wasn't    What's that doing up there anyhow?
Master.
What is it?
I am sorry I made you nervous.
Who?
M-me?
Oh, Jeannie.
You You didn't really think I was scared of that cat, did ya?
You were not?
Of course not.
Oh, I am glad.
Take this out to the patio for me, will ya?
Oh, yes, master.
Thanks.
She really thought I was scared of that little cat.
Help!
Help!
Get back!
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
What is it now, major?
What is what now, sir?
Oh, well, I was just playing with the little Little cat.
Yes.
I came over to bring you the results of your psychological tests.
Oh, yes, sir.
I'm afraid we'll have to start the tests all over again.
Goodbye, major.
You don't have to leave.
Don't leave me here with   No, stop!
Back!
Back!
Jeannie!
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
What is it?
What's the matter?
Oh, master, what has happened to you?
- What do you mean?
- You've turned green.
Jeannie, it's all right.
It's my skin-diving outfit.
- What?
- Thank heavens.
I thought that while I was sleeping, someone had turned you into that.
But where are you going, master?
It is 4:00 in the morning.
Well, it's gonna be dawn in a couple of minutes.
I'm going down to the beach.
Dressed like that?
Oh, Roger and I are going hunting for sunken treasure.
Oh, that is a waste of time, master.
I can give you all the treasures you desire.
Oh, no, if you don't mind, I'd rather find it myself.
If I lived to be another 2000 years old, I will not understand you.
It's not the treasure I am interested in, Jeannie, it's the hunt, you see.
How do you know there is treasure there?
Well, I don't know exactly.
It's just that a lot of pirate ships used to ply the waters off the coast there and it's rumoured that Captain Kidd had a ship go down with treasure on it.
Who is this Captain Kidd?
Oh, I was just reading about him here.
Let's see.
Captain Kidd William Kidd started out as a respectable seamen.
The British government sent him out to harass the French fleet in 1700.
His men forced him to turn renegade and he became a pirate.
Well, he was quite a fellow.
It took the whole British navy to look for him.
I am sure he was not as brave as you, master.
Oh, Jeannie.
I'd hate to have tangled with him, I'll tell you that.
I am sure you would have beaten him, master.
- I doubt it.
- Oh, yes, you would have.
- Is that all right with you, fellas?
- Yeah!
- Hey, you!
- Oh, who?
Me?
- Yeah, you!
- Kill him, Captain Kidd.
With pleasure.
Prepare to die!
Now, wait a minute.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
What's keeping you so long, huh?
I want- Get him, master!
I told you-!
I'm sorry, captain.
Wait!
Will you wait?
Kill him, master!
He beat Captain Kidd.
Any orders, captain?
- Captain?
- You beat Captain Kidd.
You're our new leader.
Well, I certainly appreciate your offer but I'm afraid I'm not gonna be able to stay.
You ain't thinking of running out on us, are you?
No, no, but I do have- Because the only way anyone ever leaves this crew is feet first.
Feet first.
Any orders?
No, no, not at the moment but if I have any, I'll certainly let you know.
Aye, aye, captain.
Back to work, you lubbers.
- You.
- Me, sir?
Yes.
I want to see you alone.
Oh, well, I have a lot of work to do, Captain Master.
No, no, no, I want to talk- What do you want to do with the prisoner?
Prisoner?
What prisoner is that?
The girl we captured from the British frigate.
Oh, yes, yes.
That prisoner.
Do you want to kill her, or do you want me to?
- Kill her?
- I'll do it.
No, no, no, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Have fun.
Boy.
Hey, that's my cabin.
Well, you're certainly a messy housekeeper.
Clean that place up.
No, no, no, she's in the captain's cabin.
Where else?
- I'll call you when I need you.
- Oh, but- Don't touch me.
There's nothing to worry about.
I'm Major Anthony Nelson, United Stated Air Force.
I just want to cut your ropes.
- Did you call me, captain?
- No, I did not.
If I want you, I'll certainly let you know.
- Now, go upstairs and swab the decks.
- Aye, captain.
How did you get on this ship anyway?
As if you didn't know.
- What did you do with the others?
- What others?
Don't pretend you and your crew didn't board the Yarmouth and sink it.
But you'll pay for it.
Right now, there's a British frigate searching for you.
I don't have anything to do with this.
I'm just passing by.
I'm gonna help you escape from here.
- Do you really mean that?
- Yes.
- I told you if I need you- - Master!
I think we'd better leave, quickly.
We can't leave now.
They're gonna kill this girl.
If you stay, they are going to kill you.
I heard them talking up on deck.
The first mate wants to take over the ship.
He can have it, but I won't leave here without her.
Very well, master.
I will try to find out how they plan to kill you.
Oh, you were right, master, this is so exciting!
- Who was that?
- Oh, that was an old friend of mine.
My husband will pay you well if you save me.
He'll give you anything.
Oh, that's not necessary.
Forgive me.
I haven't introduced myself.
I'm Lady Diane Nelson.
Oh, I'm Major Anthony Nelson- - Did you say Lady Diane Nelson?
- Yes.
Are you married to Lord Charles Alfred Nelson?
- You know my husband?
- Know him?
He's my great, great, great, great grandfather.
I beg your pardon.
That means that you're my great, great, great, great grandmother.
What are you talking about?
You're gonna have a son named William and you're gonna have a daughter named Priscilla.
That is, if I can get you off this boat.
If I can't, I'm not gonna be born!
Don't do that.
Please.
- What're you doing here?
- What's taking you so long?
- We can't kill her.
- What?
I mean, I mean, we can't kill her now.
Look, I think we should torture her a little bit.
She's probably got plenty of hidden treasure she could tell us about- Oh, good thinking.
Yeah, go boil some water.
- Boil some water?
- And heat up a branding iron.
Oh, right, skipper.
Oh, no!
No, you promised!
- Oh, you promised!
You promised me!
- I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.
I was just using that to stall for some time.
But, how are you going to get me off the ship?
I've got a very influential friend.
Now you just stay right there.
Don't go away.
Be calm.
Don't go away.
Jeannie, where have you been?
Give me that thing.
You're gonna cut your head off.
- Are you ready to leave, master?
- I can't leave yet.
- You know who that girl is?
- No.
That's my great, great, great, great grandmother.
Really?
Well, I never would've known it.
She does not look a bit like you.
That's not the point.
The point is, if I don't get her off this ship there's not gonna be any me.
How are you going to rescue her, master?
You are in as much danger as she is.
You should- You should hear their plans for you.
I'm gonna sneak her off the ship and get her on that island.
She said there's a frigate looking for the pirates.
- I'll find a way of signalling them.
- Oh, that's a wonderful idea- Hey, you, back to work.
- Yeah, yeah, get back to work.
- Aye, aye, sir.
The iron will be hot in a minute.
When it's through, I just can't wait to see her walk the plank.
Yeah, yeah, it'll be a billion laughs.
I don't trust that one.
He has an honest face.
Get the men and let's take him now.
Aye, aye, mate.
I have a plan.
I'm gonna get you off this boat.
How?
How?
I want you to put on these clothes.
We're gonna sneak you off and over to the island.
That frigate ought to be along any minute now.
And we'll send up smoke signals.
Master!
Master!
- Oh, hurry, they're coming after you.
- Why?
- To kill you.
- Oh, Jeannie, they can't do that.
I'm the captain of this boat.
What do we do now?
We're going to change our plans.
There they are.
Get them.
All right, stand back.
Stand back, I mean it.
All right, you asked for it.
- Go up the steps.
- There are no back steps.
They don't build ships the way they used to.
Grab him.
No, no, no!
Take your hands off of me.
I don't think you know who I am.
I happen to be Major Anthony Nelson, in the Air Force of the United States.
If you're wise, you'll let me walk out of here.
Oh, you want to take a walk, do you?
All right.
Tomorrow at sunrise you'll walk the plank.
- Take them to the brig.
- Now, wait a- Take your hands off me- Oh, all right.
Lay them up.
Hey, wait a minute.
Which one of you wants to walk the plank first?
Let him walk the plank.
But the girl, you save the girl for us, huh?
No, no, no, they both got to walk the plank.
We don't want any witnesses.
Here!
Now let's move.
Yes.
Wait a second.
Ladies first.
Give my regards to Captain Kidd, will you now?
This isn't legal.
You can get in a lot of trouble for this.
Oh, really?
Well, don't keep the sharks waiting now, will you?
There's a British man-of-war approaching.
It's heading this way.
What are we gonna do?
They will sink us.
No, they won't.
Not as long as we hold Lady Diane prisoner.
They're getting away!
After them, after them!
After them, after them!
They're getting away.
Are they gonna catch us?
- What now?
- There's nothing to worry about.
- We'll hide here until the British arrive.
- Master, may I help you?
No, certainly not.
- Well, then I'm going to leave.
- Why?
Because, I do not want to stay and watch them bury you at sea.
Now look what you've- Now, you see what you've done?
Now you see what you did-?
Would you please relax?
Believe me, I have everything completely under control.
You two go ahead.
I'll try and hold them off.
Thanks, thanks a lot.
You are the bravest master I have ever had.
Come on, mateys.
Thank you.
Jeannie, get going, will you?
They're coming.
Go on.
Jeannie, what is this?
Jeannie!
What is this?
Master, let us get out of here.
Yeah, we're not gonna be able to hold out much longer.
Lady Diane, would you excuse me, please?
- What are you doing?
- I have a plan, Jeannie.
I'm gonna make a white flag.
If I give myself up, maybe they'll let you and Lady Diane go.
I won't let them capture me again.
What is your next plan, master?
It's no use.
They're closing in.
- We gotta get her out of here.
- I know.
- If they kill her, there will not be a you.
- Yeah.
And I would not like that very much.
Neither would I. I know what I will do.
Attention!
- The marines have landed.
- Oh, they are not marines, master.
They're British soldiers from the frigate.
That's just a figure of speech, Jeannie.
I'll never say an unkind word about you again.
Take aim, fire!
- Can't you do anything right?
- I am sorry, master.
Now, we're really in a trap.
If the pirates don't shoot us, the British will.
- Hey!
Hey, fellas!
Hey!
- Ready, take aim, fire.
- Here, try once more, master.
- Where's the flag?
- Give me the flag.
- Right here.
Hold your fire.
- That did it.
- We're saved.
Jeannie, I'm sorry, I- I know, I know, you will never say another unkind word about me again.
I only said it in the heat of action.
Hey, hey there, here we come you know, British flag!
Hey.
Hey.
Hey, flag, see!
Lady Diane, are you all right?
Now I am.
- Get the rest of those pirates.
- Hey!
Boy, you're a sight for sore eyes.
You got here just in time.
- Hang him.
- Hang?
Wait a minute.
- I'm one of the good guys.
- Captain, this man saved my life.
Anybody would've done it.
We have orders to hang all pirates on sight.
I happen to be Major Nelson, United States Air Force - on detached service to NASA.
- Is there no way to save him?
None, ma'am.
We're under king's orders.
Escort Lady Diane to the ship.
- Now, wait a minute, wait a minute.
- Goodbye.
I guess you're not going to be my great, great, great, great grandson.
I guess I'm not.
Here.
- Continue the execution.
- Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Wait a minute.
Jeannie.
Hey, wait a minute, this is a mistake.
Wait a minute, you guys.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Now, come on, I mean it.
Just- Wait a minute, you guys.
I'm not exactly who I seem.
Please.
Jeannie!
Attention!
Ready Wait a minute.
Go!
- Knock that- - Oh, that was fun, master.
- Can we do it again?
- No.
Would you please get me out of this?
I told you you'd beat Captain Kidd, master.
The next time I open my mouth, don't listen.
Oh, it was nothing, master.
- Yes, can I help you?
- Got anything that needs killing, mate?
- How did you get here?
- In my car.
In your car?
I'm from the Quick Kill Exterminating Service.
If you got them, we kill them.
It's remarkable.
That's right, mate.
And we guarantee all our work.
Would you like a demonstration?
Oh, no, thank you I've had a very trying day.
Perhaps some other time, yes?
Just as you say, mate.
I'll be back.
Cheerio.
- Did you see him?
Did you see him?
- Yes, master.
It was the pirate.
Oh, I think it was his great, great, great, great grandson.
Oh, yes, of course it was.
You know what?
He's still in the same business.
That was very good, master.
Well, I was just practicing up.
My sword arm's a little sore.
You know, I have to keep it in shape.
Did you enjoy being a pirate, master?
Well, I shouldn't admit it, but, yeah, I loved it.
Oh, I am glad!
Are there any other pirates you would like to meet?
No, no, no.
You've met one, you've met them all.
Oh, I suppose so.
I liked your great, great, great, great grandmother.
Oh, yes.
She was wonderful, wasn't she?
I have a little trouble thinking of her as a sweet little old lady.
- She had a lot of courage.
- Oh, yes.
And your great, great, great, great grandfather was very brave also.
- And handsome.
- I wonder what he looked like.
- Would you really like to know?
- Yes.
- No, I don't want to go back there.
- But this will interest you, master.
No, Jeannie, please.
Say, The Book of English Nobility.
How about that?
- There's Lady Diane.
- Oh, she is lovely.
What did her husband look like?
How about that.
I wonder what would've happened if we hadn't been able to save her.
If I'd had the same grandfather, but a different grandmother.
Would you really like to know, master?
Yeah, yeah.
Would I look very different?
A little.
Now see here, Jeannie.
I don't think this is funny at all.
You're being absolutely ridiculous.
Now, you stop this.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Master, I have been thinking.
Good, good.
It makes me look bad to have a master who is only a major.
You should be a general.
Yes, at least.
Mm.
If I spent some time at NASA with you, I could help you.
Now, wait a minute.
I could tell your general how important you are, and he would He would transfer me.
Oh, no, I would tell him how brilliant Stay away from NASA.
General Peterson's not ready for you.
Oh, good morning, Major Healey.
Morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, Tony.
Sit down.
Oh, yeah, here's your mail.
What lovely flowers.
Yeah, they're for Miss Perkins.
Who is Miss Perkins?
Uh, well, she's General Peterson's, uh, secretary.
Ugh.
She's retiring today.
No kidding.
I didn't know that.
Yeah, I guess old Stonehead's gonna find himself a new secretary.
Oh, that's too bad.
She's a nice lady.
And good secretaries are hard to find.
No, I am not.
I would make a wonderful secretary for your general.
Oh, boy.
Hey, that's a great idea.
She'd make a great secretary.
Oh, thanks.
It would solve everything.
I would be around your general all day long, and by the time I am finished, he will want to make you a general.
I'm ordering you.
Don't go near General Peterson.
Oh, but I get so tired waiting around all day for you.
Yes, I know you do.
Why don't you watch television.
There should be some good shows on.
Hey, that's a great idea.
Uh, uh, let's see, what is today?
Oh, here.
Uh, there's a movie that starts in a few minutes, Jeannie.
It's, um, a three-hour movie, and there's two more movies just like it right afterwards.
Oh, but that would take me all day.
And by then your general will probably have hired another secretary.
Promise me you'll watch them all the way through.
Very well, I promise.
Yeah.
We better get to the office.
That's for you.
Can you imagine her being a secretary, the chaos it would wreak.
This way out, please.
Hello, miss?
Hey, Roge.
Who are all the girls?
Oh, they're the gals that tried out for General Peterson's secretary.
Boy, if those are the rejects, I'd love to see who he picked.
Whew.
I wonder if Jeannie's enjoying her movies, huh?
Yeah.
What I wanted to talk to you about Roge?
Roge?
Excuse me, is this the general's office?
Yes, it is.
Oh, I am so sorry it took me so long to get here, but I had to see that last movie.
Hee-hee!
I am the general's new secretary.
Well, I'm afraid you're a little late, honey.
I've, uh, already gotten the job.
Oh, but it is very important that I have it.
You see, it is not so much for me, but for my master.
Uh, tough luck.
Uh, why don't you just go find yourself a crying towel.
A crying towel?
Beat it.
I'm busy.
Will you come in, please?
Ah, right away, general.
Better luck next time, honey.
Yes?
Oh.
You may have the job.
Look, don't send me any more women.
Find me a male secretary fast.
Oh.
Who are you?
I am your new secretary, General Patterson.
Peterson.
I'm sorry, I can't use you.
Oh, but I would be very valuable to you.
Ah, that will be Admiral Billings.
General Peterson here.
Admiral Billings?
Yeah, put him on.
Oh, hello, Chick.
It's nice to hear your voice.
Yes, I heard there was gonna be a meeting, but nobody's notified me officially yet.
Oh, Washington?
Oh, sure, I'll make it a point to be there.
Oh, everything's fine here.
We're beginning to get our Apollo off the ground.
Yeah.
Our next meeting may be up on the moon.
I know, there's no such thing as science fiction anymore.
Well, I'll be looking forward to seeing you.
Thanks for letting me know.
Goodbye.
Oh, I tell you what you can do.
Until my secretary gets here, you can, uh, clean up the Oh, I have already done that.
Well, you can type the They are typed.
Well, you can straighten up my Oh, I have already done it.
This is General Peterson.
Forget about sending me another secretary.
I found one.
Thank you, General Patterson.
Peterson.
Oh, yes, I am sorry.
Well, you and I are gonna get along very nicely, Miss, uh Jeannie.
Miss Jeannie.
What's your first name?
Jeannie.
Jeannie Jeannie.
That's unusual.
Yes.
Well, I-I will file these.
Fine.
Now, I have an 11:00 appointment with Dr. Bellows and, uh Major Anthony Nelson.
Oh, is he not wonderful?
I will see to it that you are not disturbed.
Good morning.
I'm, uh, here to see General Peterson.
I'm Anthony Nelson.
I know.
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
I saw all the movies.
Would you like to hear the plot?
In one of them, this poor cowboy Get out of here before General Peterson sees you.
He's already seen me.
I am his new secretary.
Yeah You're his what?
Huh?
Yes.
And now that I am going to be here, we can have lunch in the cafeteria every day.
Oh, I love cafeterias.
You're not gonna be here because we're not gonna have lunch together Now, you pop out and go home right now.
Come on, go.
Oh, but I cannot do that.
Why not?
Because, I would lose my unemployment insurance.
Lose your unemployment?
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
How are you, sir?
Good morning, major.
Oh, I, uh I don't believe we've met.
I'm Dr. Alfred Bellows.
Yes, Major Nelson is always telling me how I hate to be late for appointments.
I don't think we ought to keep General Peterson waiting.
Uh, you go in.
I'll be right there.
Yeah.
You look very familiar.
Have we met before?
Yes.
Remember when you came No.
No, now Now, that I think of it, uh, I was someone else.
I could swear I know you from somewhere.
She has one of those faces.
It could fit almost anybody.
I do not.
I never forget a face.
Perhaps if we had a chat, we could remember where.
Are you free for lunch?
In the cafeteria?
If you like.
Oh, I would like that.
Fine.
Now, I'll pick you up here.
Come along, major.
We don't want to keep the general waiting.
Yeah, right.
Uh, major.
Would you make a copy of that?
Uh, major.
Yes, sir.
You are three minutes late.
I'm sorry.
Very sorry, sir.
Well, look that over.
Yes, sir.
Now, if you see those two formulas at the top of the page, you'll notice one is neutral and one is acid.
Yes, sir.
It's very important to keep that in mind.
I'm sorry.
I broke your pencil, sir.
I'll get one from your secretary.
Major, here's a pencil.
Would you like some coffee, sir?
No, thank you, major.
Please, forget about the coffee.
Now, if you'll just take your diagrams there.
Oh, I think I have them in here.
I know I had them, uh I-I-I-I suppose I left them in my office, sir.
Major.
Yes?
Go get your diagrams.
Yes, sir.
I'm terribly sorry for the delay.
Excuse me.
What's the matter with him?
He seems very nervous.
I think he has a reason to be nervous, general.
What?
Does your secretary have a security clearance?
Security clearance?
Yes.
This is a very sensitive base, general.
I know I've seen that girl before.
But she denies it.
Why?
Where'd she come from?
What is she after?
I'm gonna take her to lunch today.
And I'm gonna get some answers.
And if she doesn't talk?
I'm a psychiatrist.
Yeah, that's right.
Yes.
Yes, that's right.
Seven p.m. Mm-hm.
I will tell him.
Bye-bye.
I have taken my first phone message.
Oh, good.
Oh.
Oh!
What is it?
I forgot to ask who was calling.
Jeannie, has Dr. Bellows ever seen you before?
Well, yes, yes When?
Remember, he He came into the kitchen one time when I was preparing your dinner.
Yeah.
Ha-ha!
I do not know what gave him that silly idea, but he thought that you and I were Were gonna get married, yeah.
Yes, yes.
But you can't have lunch with him.
Oh, but why not?
Look, he's only seen you once.
If he spends any time with you, he'll know that you were the girl in my kitchen.
Oh, do not worry, master.
I will outsmart him.
Outsmart Outsmart him No, no, that's the one thing you mustn't do.
You mustn't try to outsmart him.
You see, he's a psychiatrist.
It's his job to outsmart people Did you get the diagram?
Yes, sir, I have it.
We're still having lunch, aren't we?
Oh, in the cafeteria.
Oh, I am looking forward to it.
Uh, so am I. So am I. Major.

Here we are.
Well.
Oh.
This is so exciting.
Exciting?
Oh, yes.
I am not allowed out of the house very often.
You're not?
No.
And you know, it gets so tiring watching three movies on television.
Of course, the plot to the second one was lovely.
It was this boy and girl who were engaged, and the mother objected Engaged.
That's it.
Now I remember.
Weren't you and Major Nelson engaged?
I-I hardly know Major Nelson.
I see.
Um, tell me, where are you from?
Where am I from?
Yes.
Uh, where were you born?
Where was I born?
Well, you must have been born somewhere.
You know where you were born.
Oh, of course, of course.
In, uh, I-oh-ho.
I-oh-ho?
Oh-I-oh-want?
Oh-I-oh-want What?
Chicago?
Oh, yes.
Lovely city.
Tell me what part of, uh, Chicago did you live in?
The lake section?
No, no.
The mountains.
The mountains?
Mm-hm.
Did you, um, ever climb to the top of, uh, Mount Chicago?
Oh, yes.
We used to do it all the time.
Did you?
Hmm.
Fascinating.
Tell me, um, what business was your father in?
He was a used camel salesman.
I beg your pardon?
Uh, a used car salesman.
Oh, very interesting.
I like this.
Well, so do I. As a matter of fact, it may turn out to be the best lunch I've ever had in my whole life.
Oh.
Ha-ha.
Tell me more about yourself.
May I?
Oh, I love to talk about myself.
Well, when I was a little girl in Chicago, my mommy and daddy and I could never go away for weekends.
We loved to climb Mount Chicago, but Daddy always had to be home to feed the camels.
The cars.
And Mama used to pack this marvelous lunch in a wicker basket Hi, Al.
Tony, you gotta see the new dish in General Peterson's office.
Whew.
- Around the base?
- What about dinner tonight?
I asked her first about dinner.
Gentlemen, please.
I'm sure you all have some work to do.
Gentlemen, please, I'm sure this young lady has some work to You have some work, don't you?
Yes, I do.
I better get back to work.
Fine.
I will see you all later.
I'm going to take you up on that.
All right.
Bye-bye.
Thank you very much.
Bye.
Ohh, they are all so friendly.
Ha-ha!
Yes, aren't they?
What about lunch?
Hm?
Lunch.
Oh, well, it was wonderful.
We had roast beef with mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans and I'm not interested in the menu.
What did you and Dr. Bellows talk about?
Oh, you do not have to worry, master.
He was like a child in my hands.
Yeah You He wasn't suspicious?
Oh, not anymore.
He was at first.
Yeah.
But then, I told him that my father was a used car salesman in Chicago.
From then on, it was easy.
Really?
Yes.
I had him eating out of my hand.
Yeah.
Well, this-this-that's wonderful.
But I don't think we ought to take any chances.
You better pop out of here and go home.
No.
No?
No.
No.
Not until I've had General Peterson promote you to a general.
Huh?
I'm not interested in becoming a general.
Oh, of course you are.
And you do not have to worry about Dr. Bellows.
Yeah.
He will be no problem at all.
Long distance?
This is Dr. Alfred Bellows at Cape Kennedy.
Let me speak to the CIA in Washington.
Tony!
Oh, Tony Oh.
Oh, do I have news for you.
Guess who General Peterson's new secretary is?
Jeannie.
Je You knew?
Yeah, but it's only temporary.
Well, what does that mean?
It just means that General Peterson, within the hour, is gonna have a new secretary.
You're gonna make her quit?
I'm not gonna make her do anything.
She's gonna wanna quit.
Oh, you should write a book.
I'll see you later.
I've gotta get this plan into action.
Hello, Jeannie.
Hello, master.
You came to watch me work.
No, I came to tell you some very exciting news.
Really?
Mm-hm.
What happened?
Oh, master.
Oh, the stars of a general.
Mm, yes, I just got the news.
Oh, that is wonderful.
And I hardly mentioned you at all to General Patterson Peterson.
Yeah, well, he must've gotten the message.
He has a very fast mind.
Oh, I am so happy.
Oh!
Now I can hold my head up in front of all those other genies.
Yeah, I thought you'd be pleased.
Oh!
And you can tell General Peterson that he He's just gonna have to get himself a new secretary.
Mm.
I will.
General Anthony Nelson.
Yeah.
Oh, that sounds wonderful.
Well, I Jeannie.
Uh, hello, Tony.
General.
Can you make five copies of those, please?
I'd like them in the afternoon mail.
Oh, yes, sir.
Why, major?
I'm glad you asked me that, sir.
Oh, but it is not "major".
It is "general".
Uh, general.
General Anthony Nelson.
Did they not tell you?
No.
Did they tell you?
No, sir.
No, sir.
Um, I can explain, sir.
I was trying to impress the girl.
You know how it is.
A beautiful girl and a pair of stars on the shoulder.
It's a very impressive thing and, uh You were young When you were young It's a practical joke, really.
Next time you try a little joke like this, you'll be headed straight for a court-martial.
Take those stars off, major.
So you are not a general.
You You tried to trick me, so that I would quit my job.
Well Well, now N-now I will never quit.
Not until you are a full-bird general.
What do you want?
Come in.
Dr. Bellows.
Yes?
Amos Lincoln, CIA.
Oh, hello, Mr. Lincoln.
Uh, sit down, won't you.
Thank you.
I'm sorry I couldn't get here sooner.
Our flight from Washington was delayed.
You flew in from Washington?
Uh-huh.
Oh, you really needn't have bothered, Mr. Lincoln.
I was only making a routine inquiry about one of our employees.
Well, it may have started out as a routine matter, doctor, but at this point, it's on the top priority list of half a dozen government agencies.
I don't understand.
First of all, there's no record of a Miss Jeannie Jeannie having been born in Chicago.
I knew it.
Or anywhere else in the United States.
You mean, she's an alien?
Well, if she is, she's here illegally.
The Immigration Department has no record of her ever having entered the country.
The Department of Health, Education and Welfare has no social security application from her.
And the Air Force has no security clearance on Miss Jeannie Jeannie.
The FBI is investigating it for a possible sabotage angle.
You beginning to get the picture?
That's incredible.
Doctor, I've been with the bureau for over 15 years, and this is the first time we haven't been able to turn up one single statistic on a person.
For all we've been able to find out, she might've sprung up out of thin air.
She came from somewhere.
That's right.
Don't worry.
Before we're through, we'll be able to tell you everything there is to know about that girl.
I've gotta talk to you.
Here, look at this.
General Gillian and his wife are sponsoring a ball for the orphans Saturday night.
Boy, some of those generals' wives.
Whew.
Roger.
We're in trouble.
We're in trouble?
I mean, I'm in trouble.
Oh, you are.
The CIA is here.
Shh.
The CIA is here?
That's right.
Not only that, every department and agency in the United States government is after Jeannie.
Oh.
Well, what happened to your plan?
Did it work?
No.
It backfired.
If they get ahold of her, they're gonna have her whole life story in two minutes, and mine.
Your only chance is to get her out of here, then.
Don't you think I've tried that?
She won't go.
She's She's staying here because she thinks she's doing me some kind of a favor.
I've got it.
Hm?
I've got it.
The last time you got it, you really had it.
I'm gonna need your help.
Now, I want you to listen carefully.
What?
You know those pictures?
Yeah.
The ones you have in your drawer of the girlfriends.
Drawer pictures.
Yeah.
Jeannie.
H-hello, master.
Hello.
You are not angry with me?
Angry with you?
No.
As a matter of fact, I'm grateful to you.
You are?
Well.
What have I done?
Oh, it's not what you've done.
It's what you're gonna do.
General Anthony Nelson.
I thought you did not want to be a general?
No, Jeannie, I must've been out of my mind.
Do you realize what this means to me?
This means that I'm gonna be the youngest general in the United States Air Force.
Yes.
Mm.
It's gonna be a pay hike, uh, uh, power, uh, more prestige, privilege Oh, I knew you would change your mind.
How soon can you arrange it?
Oh, right away.
Uh This afternoon?
Good, good, good.
That's wonderful.
And now, uh Now, wait a minute.
You better give me a couple of days.
Uh, I still have a few things to clear up first.
What?
Well, I just, uh I have a few things to clear up first.
Everything's all set.
Oh, good.
I thought you'd never get here.
I thought you could take Eloise out to breakfast.
Uh-huh.
And you could take Edna out to lunch.
Yeah.
And you could just pick one of these beauties here for dinner, huh.
Any one of those.
Ah, yeah.
Juanita.
I'll take her out to dinner, and we'll see which one of these will do.
Ooh, wh-wh-which one of these will do what?
Who?
Who are they?
Oh, one of these girls is gonna be my wife.
Your wife?
Isn't that great?
Tony told me you arranged to have him made general, and, of course, everybody knows a general has to be married.
So I brought over a few pictures here to view the eligible girls in town.
Generals have to be married?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Uh, that's one of the rules.
Now What have I done?
Master?
About Juanita, I think You mean, in order to be a general, you must have a wife?
Oh, yeah.
That's right.
Oh!
You cannot marry any of these girls.
Why not?
They're really all quite nice.
Yes, you don't have to worry.
I'm gonna pick out a good one.
Well, I think I have made a mistake.
Huh?
Uh, uh, y-y-you are much too young to be a general.
I am?
Would you be terribly upset if you were not a general?
Well, I don't know.
I kinda had my heart set on it, Jeannie.
But if If you don't think it's a good idea, then Oh, it is a terrible idea, master.
Yeah.
All right, then I won't.
Oh, thank you.
Ha-ha!
You go home and fix some dinner, and I'll be there later.
Oh, no.
Please let me stay with you.
No, really.
I'd rather you go home now.
But I want to play secretary.
Now, really.
Now.
Very well.
I did it.
I did it.
You did it?
I did it.
I was helping.
I was the one who brought the pictures.
Oh, you were great.
Ha-ha-ha!
I told you, when she saw those pictures, she'd flip.
One picture is worth a thousand words.
Oh, you sure fooled her, boy.
Well, you're still the old master.
Yeah.
Oh, God, I hated to do it We're looking for Miss Jeannie.
Have you seen her?
Uh, Jean Miss Jeannie.
Oh, no, you mean the girl that was just here?
No, she's gone.
When will she be back?
I don't think she's coming back.
Uh, that's right.
Well, we'll find her.
You're wearing sergeant stripes, major.
Yeah, what are you doing in these sergeant stripes?
Would you mind explaining that, Major Nelson?
Yes Yeah.
Whose side are you on?
Uh, uh, uh, uh, sir, it It actually Well, I have this girlfriend, a-and she sometimes just doesn't
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
- Good morning, master.
- Good morning, Jeannie.
Oh, master, you shouldn't have.
I know.
I didn't.
You mean that present is not for me?
- No.
- It is for another girl.
No, it's not for another girl.
- Oh, well, I'm glad.
For her sake.
- What does that mean?
It means that when she opened it, she would have found frogs inside.
Come on.
You wouldn't do that.
Jeannie, would you mind?
Thank you.
Master, why are you giving a present to a man?
This man happens to be getting married.
It's his wedding present.
I love weddings.
- Yes, I know.
- Who is getting married?
Billy Nopar.
He's one of our astronauts.
He is very wise.
I believe that all astronauts should be married.
Do you not?
No, I do not.
See you this evening.
Are you going to the wedding, master?
It's this afternoon.
I'm the best man.
Well, I know that.
Please be sure to tell me what the bride wore.
- Sure, sure.
- I imagine that she will wear something like this.
Do you like it, master?
Oh, boy, that is beautiful.
Just lovely.
It's- It's a pity to waste it, though.
I mean, Billy Nopar has already picked out his wife.
- I was not thinking about Billy Nopar.
- No?
You know what they say about weddings?
No.
What do they say about weddings?
They always come in twos.
- Hello, Major Healey.
- Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
I want to get married.
You want to get marr-?
You want to get married?
Realize the problems that'd involve?
I'm an astronaut, you're a genie.
I worked hard to get where I am.
Boy, do you realize all the sacrifices I'd have to be making if I married you?
We can marry Sunday.
We'll go up to Las Vegas, have a little time there.
Then to Switzerland.
Our own chalet.
Take our time.
Major Healey, I cannot marry you.
You can.
Listen, I can get a ring.
I'm in love with Major Nelson.
Well, it's too bad.
We'd have made a handsome looking couple.
I cannot understand why Major Nelson does not want to marry me.
I would be a wonderful wife for him.
Well, maybe he's just not ready to get married yet.
Well, what is it that makes a man want to get married?
Well, a lot of guys look for the three C's in a marriage.
- The three C's?
- Cooking, cleaning and cuddling.
Cooking, cleaning and cuddling.
I can do that.
Jeannie, you're too eager.
I mean, you gotta to play hard to get.
Hard to get.
That's right.
Thank you, Major Healey.
I hope you can come to the wedding.
Whose side am I on anyway?
- Good evening, master.
- What's going on here?
I've prepared all of your favourite dishes.
Well, it just smells wonderful, Jeannie.
- Shouldn't have gone to that trouble.
- It was no trouble.
I'm not terribly hungry.
You should've seen what they had at the wedding.
- You know these little- - Have you seen the paper?
Yeah, yeah, I did.
About the wedding.
I remember what she wore.
A diamond- - You read about the floods in Europe?
- Yes, I did.
- Most terrible.
- Billy Nopar and I talked about it.
You know, when he put the ring on, he did one of th- Dinner is served.
- Did you really bake that yourself?
- Oh, yes, master.
With your own hands?
- Yes.
- Well, it's sensational.
- Billy Nopar's wife came for- - Coffee?
No, no.
I have some, thanks.
Jeannie, why don't you want to talk about the wedding?
The wedding?
I am not interested.
This morning you weren't interested in anything else.
I must have changed my mind.
I am very hard to get.
What?
Well, I mean I'm not interested in getting married.
- Well, that's wonderful.
- It is?
- Yeah, you know why?
- No.
Why?
Because neither am I. I will have some more of that pie.
Oh, darling, should we be doing this?
We've got to grab our happiness while we can.
Who knows, tomorrow I may be in orbit.
Lost somewhere among the shining stars.
Roger, I worry about you so.
Sue, you've got to be brave.
Oh, Roger.
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?
What are you doing here so late?
We have a breakfast appointment, I thought we could look fresh.
And I want to look nice and fresh too for you.
We can have a nice time together.
Oh, I know.
You're very sweet too.
What are you doing here?
Roger.
Tomorrow morning.
The bay's breakfast.
Jeannie, you've got to learn to knock.
It did not do any good.
No, it did not do any good.
Not for me anyway.
I mean the advice you gave me.
Major Nelson does not want to get married.
Well, did you use reverse psychology?
Yes.
Nothing will make him change his mind.
Well, then, why don't you forget about Tony and marry sweet, lovable me?
Because I am going to marry sweet, lovable Major Nelson.
Jeannie, I told you.
Tony is never going to change his mind.
There is one thing that will change his mind.
What's that?
Of course, it is forbidden.
Hold it, young lady.
Wait a minute.
What's forbidden?
- And also it could be very dangerous.
- What could be very dangerous?
But I am afraid there is no other way.
If you're doing something dangerous you better tell me first.
Goodbye, Major Healey.
Do not worry.
Everything will be just fine.
I think.
Jeannie?
Well, she'll never get Tony to marry her.
I wonder what he would like for a wedding present.
"The spell of Lahalabah is the most powerful of all the spells.
In all our history, it has never been known to fail.
" Goody.
"The genie must first obtain three things from the person put under the spell.
A lock of hair, a piece of fingernail and a small circle of cloth from his clothing.
" That should not be too difficult.
And then Mrs Anthony Nelson.
Darling, I would like you to meet Mrs Nelson.
This is Mrs Anthony Nelson.
This is Tony's wife.
I will make him so happy.
Jeannie!
- Good evening, master.
- Good evening, Jeannie.
I brought some papers home, and I can't for the life of me figure out what I did with them.
I left them upstairs, I left them downstairs.
Jeannie, it was a little envelope about this big with a red stripe.
Said " Confidential.
" - No.
- No.
Isn't that funny?
I wonder what- - Master?
- Yeah?
Sit down, master.
You need a haircut.
Jeannie, I haven't got time for a haircut.
Oh, your hair is much too long.
- Don't put those things on my head.
- Oh, neatness counts.
Je- I haven't- I really haven't got time.
I've got to get to the base.
I came back to- To get a clean shirt and pick up some papers.
I'm going night flying tonight.
Night flying?
For night flying you need a haircut and a manicure.
Thank you, Jeannie, but for night flying I have my own barber.
I'll look downstairs.
Just a tiny haircut.
Yeah- Jeannie, you put those things away before you hurt yourself.
A trim?
All right, I'll change my shirt first.
Will you be out late, master?
Yes.
You might say that.
May I have those, please?
Yes, I'm going to the Aleutians.
Oh, that is near the South Pole.
No.
The North Pole.
Well, one Pole is like another.
I miss you so when you're away.
Nothing to worry about.
I'm a qualified pilot.
And I'll see you when I see you.
Will you kiss me goodbye?
Sure.
- What was that?
- What was what?
I heard something.
What was it?
Jeannie, there's something going on in that sweet little head of yours.
I'd love to find out what it is, but I just don't have the time.
- What was that?
- Oh, it was nothing.
What was that?
You'd better hurry, or you are going to be late for your flight.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
I'll go down and I'll change and get a fresh tie.
You better put some mothballs in my closet.
Goodbye.
I don't know what you're up to, but you're not gonna get away with it.
Goodbye, master.
" Do you have the objects from your beloved"?
Yes.
"Good.
Place them in a goatskin bag.
" Goatskin bag.
Goatskin bag.
Tie, hair, fingernail.
Goatskin bag.
"Are they in the bag"?
Yes.
"Then recite the incantation to Lahalabah.
O, great place where spirits dwell Hear thee now my magic spell Hair and nails and cloth of loom Mak e Fill in first and last name of subject of spell.
Give middle initial, if any.
Hair and nails and cloth of loom Mak e Major Anthony Nelson-" No middle initial.
"Be my groom Ere another change of tide Mak e Fill in first and last name of person casting spell.
Give middle initial, if any.
Ere another change of tide Mak e Jeannie-" Sorry.
That is my whole name.
"Be my master's bride" It is done.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Hi.
I had to come back.
Master, what are you doing here?
I had to come back.
You get that wedding outfit.
When I come back from the Aleutians tomorrow, we're getting married.
- Did you hear something?
- No.
It is truly lovely.
Haji.
What are you doing here?
I've come to find out what you're doing.
I?
Oh, well, I am doing nothing.
You have used the love incantation over your master.
Oh, just a little.
Decree 720, paragraph six, subhead three.
" It is forbidden for any genie to cast a love spell over her master.
" Really?
Well, next time I will know better.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
There shall be no next time.
You will cancel the spell.
Oh, I do not wish to do that.
You refuse?
But I love him so very much, and he loves me.
But- But I did not even need the silly old spell.
I'm sure he would have married me anyway.
I tell you for the second time.
But I cannot cancel it.
But all the arrangements have been made for the wedding.
I tell you for the third time.
Well, just one tiny little spell will not do any harm.
Why do we not just forget it this time and I- You have been warned.
Haji?
Haji?
Haji?
I have been warned?
Roger, how long is it gonna take you to pack?
Pack what?
Where am I going?
Las Vegas.
You're gonna be my best man.
- Your best- You're getting married?
- Yeah.
You're getting married.
Well, congratulations, you sly dog.
You've kept her under wraps.
Who's the lucky girl?
- Jeannie.
- Jeannie who?
Jeannie?
Our Jeannie?
- No.
My Jeannie.
- Well, you can't marry her.
- Why not?
- Why not?
Well, she's- Roger, she's beautiful and- And warm-hearted and kind.
Oh, that girl's perfect.
I've heard of mixed marriages, but a genie and an astronaut?
Roger, we're getting married.
Are you coming with us or not?
Look, if you get married, everyone is going to want to meet your wife, right?
- Yeah.
- Well, I can hear it now.
" Does your wife smoke?
Yes.
What brand?
No brand.
She just smokes.
Excuse me, folks, while I get my wife out of the bottle.
" Dr Bellows will love that.
That's great.
You're gonna be washed up.
Roger, don't worry.
Jeannie's not going to let anything happen.
You're going through with this?
Of course I am.
Well, I can't explain it, Roge but I've never wanted anything more in my whole life.
- Are you coming with us?
- To Las Vegas?
Well, if you're gonna get married, that's the place to gamble.
Oh, yes, I have your reservation, Mr Nelson.
- Good.
- I am Mrs Anthony Nelson.
We're not actually married yet.
- You're not?
- But we will be as soon as the minister gets here.
He's on his way.
He's going to be here any minute.
- Here's your key, miss.
- Thanks.
And yours, Mr Nelson.
The bellboy will show you to your rooms.
Dr Dawson, I have a message for you for room 527.
Thank you.
Roge, the minister is going to be here any minute.
Wait a minute.
This is my last dollar.
I've been here for five minutes - and I'm wiped out already.
- You know you can't- - I hit the jackpot!
- Oh, Roger.
- I hit the jackpot.
- Roger.
It's all right, officer.
We'll meet you up in the room.
- Four-twelve.
- Four-twelve.
I'll pick up the money.
Four-twelve.
Oh, boy.
Master, are you all right?
I think it's my ankle.
Would you mind lifting up a minute?
- Roger, look, I - Move aside, please.
- Let him through.
- Let us through.
- Let me through.
- Dr Dawson, our doctor.
Let me through here.
He does not need a doctor.
He needs a hospital.
This man has a broken ankle.
He's not going to the hospital.
Well- And why not?
Because he does not have a broken ankle.
You may get up and walk now.
- Thank you, Jeannie.
- Don't wish to be late for our wedding.
Madam, he cannot walk on that foot.
Believe me, if Jeannie says I can walk on it, I can walk on it.
- Right.
- Watch.
What happened?
Well, I'll tell you what happened.
He just broke his wrist.
Oh, that's impossible.
Can't you help him?
No.
The Haji's warning.
I must have lost my power.
You- You must have lost your what?
- Easy.
Easy, I'll take care of you.
- Help me, doctor.
- Hello, master.
- Hello.
Boy, what a unlucky jackpot that turned out to be.
Jeannie, can't you blink me out of here?
I have tried, it does not work.
What do you mean it does not work?
You're a genie, aren't you?
Yes and no.
What do you mean y-?
What hurts, your arm or your leg?
- It's my stomach.
Get the doctor.
- Doctor, I'll get the doctor.
Doctor!
Nurse!
Doctor!
You have to leave.
My dear, you have to leave.
I'll treat you later.
Yeah, yes.
Doctor, help me, will you?
Yeah, that's it.
That's exactly- - Do not worry.
He will be fine.
- Yeah, fine.
Oh, doctor.
Doctor, what's happening?
Acute appendicitis.
We're going to have to operate.
- Oh, no.
- You know something?
This is not his day.
I- I can't understand it.
I can.
I put Major Nelson under a spell so that he would want to marry me.
You put- A spell?
Well, get him out of it.
Then he would not want to marry me.
And he needs me to take care of him.
He's in there with a broken arm and appendicitis.
How could you do this?
I've lost my power.
Haji warned me not to put him under a spell.
Well, what if you broke the spell?
Could you get your powers back?
Yes.
Then I would not be Mrs Anthony Nelson.
Well, I think it's a question of what Tony needs more, a wife or a genie.
A wife.
All right, men.
Right down this way, men.
- What's happening?
- Taking Major Nelson to emergency surgery.
This is Dr Benson the state inspector of hospitals.
Well, I- I cannot let them operate on him.
Well, a wife can't cure appendicitis.
But a genie can.
Oh, well, I did not want to be married anyway.
Hurry up or there's not going to be enough of him left for either of you.
Lahalabah, listen well While I break this magic spell Let the spell I cast be gone I must have said the wrong words.
Thank you.
Get a syringe, Eddie.
- Automobile accident?
- No.
Just clumsy.
He's got a broken wrist, a broken ankle and acute appendicitis.
Doctor, where's Jeannie?
If you'll just get a hold of Jeannie you'll see that none of this is necessary.
Young man, be quiet.
You are sicker than you think.
- Jeannie?
- Easy, very easy.
Easy, easy.
- We're back where we started from.
- I think I know what I did wrong.
Lahalabah hear my shame Return the spell from whence it came From whence it came?
Listen now, and listen well Tak e away my master's spell Hold it.
Now, just be quiet.
You're gonna be just fine.
I'm feeling pretty good already.
You said he had a broken wrist.
- Miracle of modern medicine, sir.
- You said he had a broken ankle.
- I don't understand.
- I'm going to recommend you - highly to all my friends.
- What about your appendicitis?
Yeah, what about it?
Oh, master, you are all well.
- Yeah, I feel great.
- Good.
Look who is here.
" Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here - Take this woman in holy mat-" - Excuse me, sir.
- Jeannie, I can't marry you.
- It will only take a minute.
A minute?
What time is it?
- It's 5 after 5.
- Five after f-?
I've gotta be in General Drew's office at 5:00.
Hey, you're gonna be late.
It is a short ceremony.
It will take no time at all.
Please continue.
- No, I can't.
Jeannie.
- "When in the bloom of youth, two-" Please.
I'm sorry, they're gonna be discussing the Apollo Project.
- Well, you'll never make it now.
- Jeannie, get this cast off me.
- But I do not wish- - Now, come on, both of them.
Off.
" Dearly beloved, we are gathered together here-" No, no really, I can't.
I just- I just can't.
I'm sorry.
- Get me to that meeting.
- But- Now, come on, I mean it.

I know how it must inconvenience you- I- I- I'm terribly sorry

He saved France and started to bring democracy to all of Europe.
And then what happened?
Well, he was He was badly advised.

If If you try to conquer Europe, you're going to fail.
What else do you know about my plans?

Are you mad?
Now, you mustn't go through with it, sir.
If you attack Russia, you're gonna suffer one of the worst defeats in history.
Napoleon, defeated?
Yes.
I'm coming to that.
You're coming to what?
Oh, uh Uh, Waterloo.
Don't fight Wellington there.
If you do, you'll You'll end up being sent to Elba.
Never mind Elba.
So you think it will be a mistake for me to turn Europe into an empire?
A disaster.
I must think about this.
Well, you'll never regret talking to me, sir.
We will talk again later.
Join the others.
There's plenty of food and drink.
Yes, yes.
Oh, I've, uh, been meaning to ask you about, uh These wool uniforms.
Tell General Pichegru I want him immediately.
Attack Russia.
It would be an insanity.
The man is mad.
Mad or a spy.
But who would've sent him?
Russia, of course.
I've been thinking of Russia.
The hungry iceberg waiting to destroy an unwary army.
And suddenly this clumsy spy comes to me and tells me not to attack it.
Oh, why would Russia send him here to tell you that?
For only one reason, my dear Pichegru.
It could be that the iceberg is not as terrifying as it seems.
Russia must have something to fear.
And it could only have something to fear if it's vulnerable.
We will attack!
And it shall be my greatest victory.
As you wish, sire.
And what shall we do with this spy?
It certainly is a pleasure meeting you, madam.
Of course.
I've read a great deal about you, but I must say, you're much more beautiful than your paintings.
Am I?
Yes.
Master?
May I speak with you a moment, please?
"Master"?
Yes.
Yeah, it's a pet name.
Ah.
Would you excuse me, please?
Pardon me.
Jeannie, um I'm busy.
Mm.
So I see.
Ye What do you want?
Master, you wish to change the course of history.
Yes.
Then I think you have done it.
What do you mean?
You have just talked Napoleon into attacking Russia.
He thinks you're a spy, and he's going to kill you.
No, no, no.
I'm sure you misunderstood him.
Yes, he is.
I had a long talk with him.
He was very amenable to everythi We Now, fellas.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Napoleon.
You are new?
Oh, no, no, no.
I am old.
I mean, you are new at my court?
Oh, yes, sir.
But, of course, it is a very old court.
Ha.
You are very beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
What is your name, my child?
Oh Uh, Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Uh-huh.
Well, Jeannie.
I would like to see and talk to you, and get to know you better.
And perhaps, we could meet later tonight?
Oh.
I am afraid not.
Uh A friend of mine is in terrible trouble.
I could get your friend out of trouble.
Oh.
No, thank you.
But you are going to be much too busy worrying about Russia.
Hey, I'm a major.
You guys can't go around hitting an officer.
What's the matter Go in the cell.
Get in there.
What time is this, uh  Dawn.
Sorry, madam.
No visitors.
Oh.
Wha?
I'm sorry I am late, master, but your friend Napoleon Bonaparte wanted to talk with me.
Yes?
He asked me to return later.
Well, are you ready to go home now?
Yeah, we can't go now.
Oh, of course we can, master.
No, no.
I mean we can't go and leave Napoleon in the lurch like this.
Oh, but he thinks you're a spy.
He will not listen to you.
Yeah.
That's right.
Jeannie.
Hm?
You can make him listen.
I?
Yes, yes.
Didn't you say he wanted you to return?
Yes.
Did he seem interested in you?
Well yes.
But you are the only man that I I want you to go to his palace.
Oh, but why?
Because you've got to convince him that if he starts a war, it's gonna lead to a catastrophe.
Now, you think you can do that?
Oh.
But I do not know anything about war, master.
But you know something about men.
I do.
I want you to flatter him.
He has a tremendous ego.
Uh, you've got to make him think that all of this is his idea.
Jeannie this is a tremendously important mission.
Oh, master.
Are you choosing me for this mission because I am the only one in the world who can do it?
I'm choosing you for this mission because there's nobody else here.
Now, pop over to the palace and go to work on him.
Go to work on him.
Yes, master.
And do not worry.
I will handle it brilliantly.
And remember, be subtle.
He's got to think it's his idea.
Oh, I am probably the most subtle genie in the whole world.
Oh.
That's my girl.
Oh.
What does "subtle" mean?
Go!
Our troops will march in through here, toward the soft underbelly of Europe, and into the Caucasus.
No, Pichegru.
I have changed my mind.
But why?
Russia sits on Europe like a sleepy bear, ready to devour anything that comes near it.
Only a fool would attack.
Then what do we do about this, uh, Major Nelson, the spy?
We have no proof that he was sent by Russia.
I am back.
Oh, what a pleasant surprise.
Ha-ha.
You have met General Pichegru?
This is Mademoiselle Jeannie.
Oh.
You are the one who is going to try to kill Napoleon, and he is going to have you strangled.
But she's outrageous, sire.
But so beautiful.
Oh.
Pichegru, would you excuse us?
You, uh You would not, uh, change your mind?
No, call all the plans off.
As you command, sire.
I thought you were not coming.
You said you had to help a friend.
Oh, but I am helping him.
That is why I am here.
But I don't understand.
Oh, Major Nelson sent me here to work on you.
To work on me?
Yes.
But he said that I must be subtle.
What does "subtle" mean?
It means honest.
It means that you must tell me everything Major Nelson said.
Oh.
Well, he said that it was very important that I try to talk you out of attacking Russia, but that you must think that it is your own idea, because you have a tremendous ego.
Is that subtle enough?
Indeed it is.
Oh, I knew I could do it.
So he's trying to trick Napoleon into not declaring war.
Any fool can see that the bear is sleeping.
Oh.
Waiting to fall into the hands of an invading army.
Nothing shall stop me.
Thank you, my dear.
Oh, you are welcome.
What did I do?
You have reminded me of France's glorious destiny.
Nothing shall stop France from ruling the world.
Oh.
Arrest this woman.
Oh, am I going to the Bastille?
I'm afraid so.
Oh, thank you.
Mwah.
Come along.
Ah, thank you.
Thank heavens you're back, Jeannie.
I knew you could do it.
I said to myself What went wrong?
Nothing, master.
I was very subtle.
I told him everything.
You You told him everything?
It is all fixed.
It's all fixed.
Napoleon has decided not to attack Russia.
Ha.
Good girl.
He is going to attack a big bear instead.
Oh.
Oh.
You're kidding.
May we go home now, master?
No.
What am I gonna do?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I got one last chance.
I've got to get to Josephine.
Oh, believe me, master, she's much too old for you.
She's the only one Napoleon will listen to.
Now, if I can just talk to her, yeah, I'm sure she'll help.
Oh, master, would it not be much simpler if we just went home?
No, we can't leave him like this.
Can you get Josephine here?
Well, if that is what you wish.
That is what I wish.
Thank you.
Uh, now Oh.
You have five minutes.
I received a message that you wish to see me about my husband.
The messenger said it was life and death.
Yes.
He's absolutely right.
Uh Your husband is about to make a terrible mistake.
Now, you've got to stop him from attacking Russia.
Oh, I do not mix in His Majesty's military affairs.
Well, if you don't use your influence, he's gonna wind up on Elba.
Elba?
That's the island where they're gonna exile him.
You are joking.
Of course, you won't be there.
He'll be married to Louise, but still I Louise?
He's going to escape from Elba, raise an army, and fight Wellington at Waterloo.
And believe me, he's going to lose.
Who is this "Louise"?
Well, that's not important.
The important thing is you've got to convince Napoleon not to go into battle.
How long has he known her?
Who?
Louise!
Gosh, I don't know.
Will you talk to Napoleon?
No.
N No?
But you're the only chance I have Don't you love him?
I love him more than life itself.
But how do I know that anything you're saying is true.
Can you prove that they are going to exile him to Elba?
Well, no, I can't prove it.
I Uh, perhaps if you can tell me who this Louise is, I could find out whether you are lying, or whether you really know what's going to happen.
You You mean, if I could show her to you, you'd believe me?
Perhaps.
Her name is Marie Louise, and she's the daughter of the empress of Austria.
He has never mentioned her to me.
Do you think you can find her?
Don't worry.
I'll find her.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
Uh You don't have a moment to lose.
Have you finished, Your Majesty?
Yes.
For now.
Master.
Oh.
How did it go?
Oh, just fine.
I think I finally found a way to persuade Josephine that I'm telling the truth.
We can help Napoleon now.
Do you know what I think, master?
What?
That I should have let you go to your lecture this morning.
Yeah.
Ah.
Did you find her?
Oh, mais oui, monsieur.
But first, I want to be very sure of what you have told me.
This Marie Louise of Austria and my husband are in love, and are going to be married?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
They're madly in love.
Bring her in.
Ah.
Ah- ha-ha-ha-ha.
Hi there, huh?
Who Who's this?
She This is the princess Marie Louise of Austria.
Take her away.
Happy guillotine, monsieur.
Hey.
Wait.
Uh, wait a minute Uh I-I-I made a mistake.
I-I got the dates mixed up.
If you just wait 18 years, I assure you, they're gonna be married.
Happily.
Ah!
Master.
When I was at the palace, I saw the most beautiful dresses.
Oh, I would love to have a new dress.
Is that all you think of, is dresses?
You never take me to Paris, master.
And while we are here, let me get one new dress.
Yeah, would you forget the dresses I will be back in a few minutes.
Yeah, but Jeannie, you can't leave me now.
They're gonna come for me any minute.
I'm not kidding.
They're gonna cut my head off.
Now, come on back.
"Major Anthony Nelson, "by the order of the Emperor of France You're bringing a pardon.
Right.
I knew it.
But Yes, yes?
First you are being guillotined!
Now, let's go!
I just want you to know about killing majors.
I happen to be an American.
Wait a minute!
Wait!
Move!
Move!
Hey, just a minute.
Listen, I want to see a lawyer.
Come on, monsieur.
Up, up, up.
Where do you think you are?
Believe me, monsieur.
It will be over in less than a minute.
I'm not interested in your timetable.
I demand to see Napoleon Bonaparte.
You are really not in a position to demand anything, are you?
Take him, executioner.
Oh!
Come on!
We would like to see you die.
Hey.
Hey, you.
Come here.
Listen, you're making a mistake, fella.
I'm on detached duty to NASA.
Go on!
Down!
Monsieur.
Do you have any last words?
Just one.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Yeah  Jeannie!
Get me out of here.
Jeannie, where are you?
Here it is, master.
Is it not beautiful?
Oh, yes, it's just gorgeous.
Now, would you mind taking this thing off of me.
Huh?
Hm?
Oh.
Yes.

Thank you very much.
Uh Oh, would you mind?
Here.
The ropes too, huh?
Hm?
Oh.
Oh.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
J-Jeannie, can't you do anything right?
Oh, I am sorry, master, but after all, I am only human.
What are you writing, master?
Oh, just a minute.
There.
Read it.
"Able was I ere I saw Elba".
Mm-hm.
Huh.
Well, what does it mean?
Oh.
Well, when you spell it backwards, it comes out exactly the same.
"Able was I, E, R" Eh Oh, "I saw"  Oh.
It does.
Yes.
Oh, you're a genius, master.
Oh, no.
You know, I'm glad we took that trip before I gave that lecture on Napoleon.
Are you.
Why?
Well I was wrong about one thing.
You remember I said that Napoleon was a great general, but he had bad advice?
Yes, master.
Well, I was wrong there.
He had He had great advice.
He just wouldn't listen.
W-w-what is wrong, master?
Hm?
Oh, it's these darn wool uniforms.
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Right Right below the shoulder blade, huh.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Whoa.
Wha?
Would you like some hot chocolate, master?
Well, thank you, Jeannie.
You shouldn't have bothered.
Oh, it was no bother.
Is there anything else you would like?
Uh, no, no.
You've You've done enough.
Oh, I wanna thank you for that wonderful dinner I had.
Oh, it was my pleasure.

Oh, that is what I am here for.
To please you.
Oh, you please me, very much.
Oh, I am glad.
On Haji's birthday, you wished to get rid of me.
I, uh Well, I know that.
I'm sorry, but, well, when you cause one of your disasters, it makes me a little nervous, that's all.
I really couldn't get along without you.
Oh, you will never have to get along without me, master.
Good, good.
I I like things just the way they are now.
Quiet and peaceful, you know.
Do you, master?
'Course I do.
Don't you?
Oh, yes, yes.
If you do.
Where'd I get this?
Yeah.
Well, if you do not need me any longer, master, I will go to bed.
Oh.
Good night, master.
Good night.
Before you- The Care and Feeding of Genies.
Oh, this must be the book Roger sent me for Christmas.
Let's see, "Blessed is he who has a genie "to do his bidding, but woe to him who lets his genie get the better of him".
That was written by an expert.
"And it is written that only the spell of Haji "can take away the power of a genie.
"If, however, a genie marries a mortal, its power vanishes forever".
Yeah, I remember old Haji.
Um "A genie is full of tricks and wiles.
"If its master  "It is written that only the spell of Haji "can take away the power of a genie.
"If, however, a genie marries a mortal, its power vanishes forever".
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Oh.
Jeannie, I gotta talk to you.
I gotta talk to you Is anything wrong, master?
Yeah, did you know that if you married a mortal, you wouldn't be a genie anymore?
Oh, yes, any genie knows that.
But is it true, really true?
Well, of course.
Why?
Well, don't make any plans for tomorrow.
You and I are getting married.
Married!
Tomorrow night?
No, no, no, I'm busy.
Roge.
Busy, yes.
Uh, how 'bout next week, okay?
Yes, you know I love you.
Goodbye, mother.
Well, what's up?
How would you like to fly to Maryland with me?
To Maryland?
Do we have a mission?
I do, I'm getting married.
You're kidding.
Yeah.
I'm marrying Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Yeah.
Our Jeannie?
Yeah, that's right.
Now, listen to me.
Now, listen to me very closely.
Jeannie's done something to you to make you think you're going to marry her.
But you're not, because I'm going to save you.
Yeah, Roger, I want to marry her.
Come on, you gotta snap out of it!
You're under a spell, can you hear me?
Roger, Roger!
I can hear you, there's no spell.
The whole thing was my idea.
Your idea?
Are you kidding?
You know you can't marry Jeannie.
She's a genie.
Well, she's not gonna be a genie anymore.
I just found out.
If she marries a mortal, she stops being a genie.
Yeah, who told you that?
I read it in a book.
Yeah, well, I bet she She wrote the book.
Oh, brother.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, well, let's not rush into these things.
Why don't you think about it for a couple of years, then you can marry her Roger, I'm marrying Jeannie.
Now, are you gonna be my best man or not?
Well, if I can't stop you, I might as well join you.
Thanks, Roge.
Got yourself a best man.
Well, thanks.
I'll, uh, also keep myself available for your court-martial.
Oh, there's nothing to worry about.
Once Jeannie and I are married, she'll be an average, everyday housewife.
Uh, what time are we leaving?
Look at this.
Huh?
What time are we leaving?
Four o'clock plane.
Ah, that gives me six hours.
Yeah, to do what?
Uh, well, I've got a few calls to make.
See you later.
Look at this.
It's my office.
See ya.
Jeannie, I've gotta talk to ya.
Did Major Nelson tell you that we are getting married tonight?
He did mention it.
Oh, isn't that exciting?
You don't know how exciting.
A former astronaut married to a genie.
Yes, is it not wonderful?
A form A former astronaut?
They won't keep him in the program when they find out about you.
But why not?
I will no longer be a genie.
Oh, great.
That's just great.
Oh, great, a former genie married to an astronaut.
I mean, how could you do this to him?
But I love him.
And he loves me.
He asked me to marry him.
Jeannie, the only reason he's marrying you is because he has some crazy idea that when you marry, you won't be a genie anymore.
But it is true.
How do you know?
It is in our legend.
Do you mean, you're gonna jeopardize Tony's whole career on a legend you're not even sure of?
I know how I can find out.
Haji.
Who's Haji?
He is the master of all the genies.
He is most powerful.
Yeah, well, why don't you talk to him, and I can leave and then maybe I comfort you Oh, thank you, Haji, for coming here.
I hope it's something important.
This is my busy time of the month.
Who's this?
Oh, I'm, uh, Major Roger Healey, sir.
I'm on detached duty to NASA.
Yes.
Why did you call me?
I need your help.
I am thinking about getting married.
Ah, excellent.
Ha-ha, it's about time.
I knew you would soon tire of your dog of a master.
You are going to marry Ali, the tent-maker?
Uh, no.
Omar, the oasis keeper?
No.
Sharif, the camel king?
Mm, no.
No?
Then who?
Tony, the dog of a master.
What?
You are going to marry your master?
Oh, yes.
Is it not true that if I marry my master, I will lose all my powers as a genie?
Yes, it is so written.
Ha.
You see?
Well, I don't care if it's written or not.
I think the marriage is gonna be a disaster.
And I say, I would make Major Nelson very happy.
Well, it's my opinion against your opinion.
And that's a draw.
Let's forget about the whole thing.
Yes.
Uh, one moment.
Is it possible for you to show him what it would be like?
Ha.
Haji could do anything.
Hey.
Look at that, very Quiet!
Shh.
Watch.
Look into the crystal ball.
Oh, that duck.
I can't tell you, it was absolutely heavenly.
Why don't you ask Mrs. Nelson for the recipe?
The orange sauce, oh And I'd like the recipe for the creamed caramel.
You couldn't beat it.
Shall we take our coffee into the living room?
Yes.
Excuse us.
Oh, that was wonderful.
Amanda, you don't remember  Excuse me.
Remember the sauce Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah.
Oh, that was wonderful.
I I'll help you clear the table.
Oh, it would only take me a second.
Oh, I keep forgetting.
And believe me, I like it better this way.
Oh.
No, no.
Sit here, darling.
You'll be more comfortable.
Oh, thanks.
Oh, Alfred, darling.
Look at that beautiful rug.
Beautiful.
Jeannie made it in her weaving class.
Made it?
Oh.
Allow me, dear.
You're certainly a lucky man, Colonel Nelson.
I think so, sir.
Last night we had meatloaf.
Alfred makes marvelous meatloaf.
Jeannie, that's a beautiful dress.
Where did you get it?
Oh, thank you.
I made it.
Oh, she makes all her own clothes.
Ma?
Oh, for heaven's sake.
She wanted to make all of his uniforms, but he wouldn't let her.
We had to draw the line somewhere.
You know she's gonna add an extra room to the house?
What?
She's wonderful with her hands.
And to think I was against this marriage.
Why were you against the marriage, Colonel Healey?
Well, I, uh He probably wanted to keep her for himself.
Yeah, well, I didn't think it was fair for one man to have her.
It's hard to keep a girl like that bottled up.
I hate to break up such a beautiful evening, but I think we should be running along.
Okay?
I think that we should go too.
Yeah.
Yes, I haven't done this morning's dishes yet.
Funny, funny, dear.
Oh, you don't really have to go now, do you?
There's no question about it, Colonel Nelson.
This marriage is the greatest thing that ever happened to you.
I agree, sir.
The perfect marriage.
The perfect marriage.
The perfect marriage.
The perfect marriage.
The perfect marriage.
Boy, was I ever wrong?
I told you, Major Healey.
Are you sure that's the way it's going to be?
You have seen it with your own eyes.
Can I ask you something?
Yes.
Uh, do you know that girl that was my date?
Mm.
Well, I've never met her before.
Uh, you wouldn't happen to have her telephone number, would you?
It's okay.
You're sure you want to marry one of these?
Oh, yes.
You won't miss having the powers of a genie?
No.
I will have something greater.
You know what this will do to your parents?
Yes.
I will not tell them that you married a mortal.
I will tell them that you were killed in a chariot accident.
Oh, thank you, Haji.
There's nothing more to say.
This is the last time I will see you, Jeannie.
Farewell.
Farewell, Haji.
And thank you.
About that telephone number, I thought maybe we Oh.
Oh, boy, was I ever wrong.
Whoa, was I ever wrong.
Then you are no longer against the marriage?
Why should I be against the perfect marriage?
It's the greatest thing to ever happen to Tony.
Oh, thank you.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, we better get ready.
We've got a wedding to go to.
Mm-hm.
Boy, my old buddy getting married.
Gee, it's hard to believe.
We sure had some great times together.
Yeah.
I have a feeling you'll be getting married pretty soon.
Ah, so do I. I think I've found the girl, but I I can't get her telephone number.
Uh, who's number?
I don't know, I haven't met her yet.
Listen, did you talk to Dr. Bellows about getting married yet?
No.
No, I thought I'd wait until after the honeymoon.
I didn't know how he was gonna take it.
I wouldn't worry about him.
He said it'll be a perfect marriage.
Hm.
Yeah.
You're getting married?
Tonight?
Yes, sir.
Uh, I have some leave accrued, and I thought we'd fly up to Maryland tonight.
Yeah, I'm gonna be the best man.
Well, I haven't met the young lady yet, but if she's the right kind of wife for you, it could be exactly what you've needed.
Uh, believe me, sir, she's a most unusual girl.
Unusual?
She puts on his slippers, and she's building on an extra room in the house.
I'm very anxious to meet her.
Oh, you will.
She's going to make you the most marvelous duck dinner.
We're gonna have to have that dinner right after your honeymoon.
I've got to get that girl's telephone number.
Are you planning on a large family?
Oh, yes, sir.
We both love children.
Well, congratulations.
Thank you very much, sir.
Children?
Why did you summon me again?
Oh, I am sorry to trouble you, Haji, but we are a little worried.
A little worried?
We were panicking.
So if Jeannie marries a mortal, are their children mortals or genies?
Mortals.
Ah.
Ah.
Ah, but sometimes, they may be genies.
There's no way of knowing.
But we've got to know.
Can we look in the future again?
I am late for an appointment in Samara.
Oh, please, please.
Please.
Please.
Uh, very well.
Yeah.
Uh "Insert flap A into flap B, after sealing C into position F. And ".
Yeah, now, we've already done that, right?
Uh, let's see now, "Do not fasten the widgets together until a square has been" Jeannie.
Would you?
Oh, yes, dear.
Darling, Daddy's trying to concentrate.
That's right.
Can you fix it, Daddy?
Oh, sure, honey.
There's nothing to it.
It says, uh, right here It says, "Any child over the age of 7 can assemble this house in 10 minutes".
Oh, I am sure it's going to be a beautiful dollhouse.
Come, Anthony.
Help Mommy.
Now, let's see.
"Do not fasten the widgets together until a square has been formed by folding Z ".
Uh, "Z over Y." That shouldn't be hard, huh?
Um Now, we dealt with Z. They never tell you which It's in the diagram, I know.
I tell you what.
Why don't you study this for a little while?
Your daddy's got some phone calls to make, huh?
Did Daddy help you again?
Yes.
Why don't you go ahead, do it.
All right.
Boy, what a great house.
Oh!
I told you never to do that, darling.
But I wanted my dollhouse.
Oh, please, darling.
If your father knew about this, it would make him terribly, terribly nervous.
Please, promise me, never, never, ever to do it again.
And, Anthony  Yoo-hoo.
Yoo-hoo!
Oh.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Hello.
Well Forgive us for dropping in like this, Mrs. Nelson, but we were just passing by.
We were nowhere near the place, we just wanted to see the children.
Hello.
Ah.
Amanda, look how they've grown.
And this is for you, young man.
Come over here next to your Uncle Alfred.
Now, look, let's lean down here and see.
I bet you can't guess what it is.
How lovely.
Well, come on.
An airplane?
Ah, now, what makes you think it's an airplane?
Look, a fire engine.
I wanted an airplane.
He He's just crazy about fire engines.
Darling, this is for you.
Thank you, Mrs. Bellows.
You're welcome.
He's hungry.
Yeah, you give him a cracker.
Ah, look, Amanda.
She's trying to feed him.
Isn't that sweet?
Won't you come in the house and have a cup of coffee?
Tony is inside.
Well, thank you, but we just had some coffee, but anyway.
Please, come in.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Oh.
How are you doing, Dr. Bellows?
Forgive us for intruding, colonel, but we've just had to see the children.
They brought them the most wonderful toys.
Oh, now, you shouldn't have done that.
Every time you come here, you spoil them rotten.
Oh, don't be silly.
We enjoy it.
They're wonderful children.
Oh, yes.
They take after their father.
They take after their mother.
Let's watch them play.
Uh, well, how 'bout some coffee?
We just had some coffee.
Have some coffee, sir.
You haven't had Jeannie's.
She makes extra-special coffee.
Have some coffee, please.
No, I I swore I just saw Oh, no, no, no, it couldn't be, No, no.
Well, didn't I bring your son a fire engine?
Yes, why don't we have?
Well, I  Oh!
Jeannie, if you knew about this, why didn't you tell me?
I did not wish to worry you.
Huh?
Worry me?
Major Nel Uh Well, look.
Your son.
He's flying through the air, and it's not even an airplane.
Why, it's a fire engine.
Make him come down.
Yes.
Now, Anthony Jeannie, do something.
Anthony!
Anthony!
Anthony!
Come down this minute.
Oh!
Stop it!
It's starting again.
First him, and now it's his children.
Listen to your mother.
Come on, Anthony, I'm not kidding.
It's one of those things that just happened.
Now, Anthony, you come down right this minute!
Oh.
Oh, no.
You're not going to get out of it this time, colonel!
Get him down!
I'll get him over here.
Anthony, you come down right this minute.

You're going to hurt yourself.
Jeannie, would you do something?
I told you he was hungry.
Anthony, you come down here!
Anthony, you come down right this minute.
Jeannie, would you do something?
They're going to court-martial him.
They're going to court-martial him!
You've seen he's had no luck with his son, but his daughter will be a genie.
Now, you must tell him that before you marry him.
It is so written.
Oh, yes, yes, I will tell him.
Good.
I must go now, and I'll warn you.
I warn you, do not disturb me again.
You've got to get hold of Tony.
What for?
What for?
To tell him the marriage is off.
Oh, why would the marriage be off?
Why would the?
You saw what happened.
Well, yes, but I will not let it happen.
I love him too much.
Well, if you're not going to tell him, I am.
Ow!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Forgive me, Major Healey.
Oh, forgive Are you kidding?
Get me down from here right now!
As soon as the wedding is over.
Oh, Jeannie, you've got to get me out of this place.
Oh, I You will be all right there until we return.
All right?
I am truly sorry you cannot be our best man.
Goodbye.
Goodb Oh, Jeannie, don't go!
Not now!
Aagh!
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
I am ready, master.
Oh.
Oh, good, good.
Well, I'll, uh I'll pack a suitcase, and we'll be on our way, huh?
Oh.
We are all packed, master.
Yes, I can see that.
Well, thank you very much.
Oh, has Roger called?
Oh, no.
No.
But he ran out of Dr. Bellow" office this morning, and I haven't seen him since.
I I wonder where he could be.
Perhaps he is tied up.
Hm?
Yeah, yeah.
Well, he probably found that girl's phone number, huh?
We'll just have to get along without him.
Well, that is what I told him.
Huh?
Oh, nothing.
Okay.
The Man from U.N.C.L.E. always gets out of these things.
Okay, Jeannie, I'm ready.
Shall I blink us to Maryland?
No.
No.
We're gonna fly to Maryland.
From now on, I don't want you to use anymore tricks.
Oh, but it is so simple, master.
No.
In a few hours, you're not gonna be a genie anymore.
And you may as well start getting used to it.
Yes, master.
Okay.
Oh, I have waited so long for this.
Mrs. Anthony Nelson.
We should've done this a long time ago.
Oh, I want to make you a good wife.
I have a feeling we're not gonna have a worry in the world.
Let me call Roger one more time.
I also have a feeling that something really important hung him up.
Oh, Jeannie, wait till I get my hands on you.
Oh, what am I calling her for?
Jeannie, Jeannie, she's not gonna help me.
Haji.
Haji!
Haji!
Ah, you can't hear me, can you?
You want to know why?
Because you're deaf!
You're a deaf, dirty old man!
And your father's a dirty old man!
And you're a coward, you hear?
A coward!
Boy, do you know what's gonna happen when I get my hands on you?
Now we shall see who is the coward.
I'll tell you who's the coward.
I am, but at least, I'm not like a genie, I keep my word.
Are you saying that a genie does not keep his word?
You told Jeannie she couldn't marry Tony, unless she told him one of his children was going to be a genie.
That is so written.
Yeah, but she erased it.
She's getting married, and she didn't tell him.
Oh.
Haji.
You're not through cooking yet.
He He doesn't answer.
I did not think he would.
Let us go, master.
This is not like Roger.
We must not miss the plane.
You're right.
You're always right.
H-Haji.
Uh, we were just leaving.
Where are you going?
To Maryland.
Um, to get married.
Has she told you about your children?
My children?
It is nothing.
Tell him.
I was going to.
Well, what about my children?
Tell him.
Well, some of our children may be genies.
"Some of our children may be genies"?
Some of our children Are you sure?
Yes, master.
Oh, that's great.
We're right back where we started.
Can you imagine what chaos life is gonna be with a bunch of little genies around?
You are my favorite genie and an adorable child, but do not bother me again.
Jeannie.
Are you all right?
Are you all right?
I will go unpack, master.
Oh, Jeannie, I'm sorry, but Well, you should've told me.
Yes, master.
You understand, don't you?
Yes, master.
Where's Roger?
Roger.
Yeah.
I forgot Major Healey!
Major Healey?
Major Healey?
Jeannie, what is this place?
Oh, this is where I left him.
Oh!
Oh.
Major Healey!
Roger?
Oh, is that you, Tony?
Hey, that Haji isn't such a bad guy after all.
I asked him for Sally's phone number, and look what he gave me.
Mm.
Oh.
Mm.
Mm.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Would you like a marshmallow?
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
The results of the medical tests on the new astronauts should be completed by next week.
I think you're gonna be very pleased, general.
Yes, sir.
I'll get them to you as soon as I have them.
Right.
Goodbye, sir.
What are you doing?
Snooping, darling.
Amanda, heh, that's privileged information you're looking at.
I know.
That's what makes it so interesting.
Oh, look.
Here's Major Nelson's chart.
Would you please put that down.
Darling, look.
Why, he's gained three pounds in one month.
So?
Well, does he eat out very much?
No.
He, uh, usually cooks at home.
Don't be silly, darling.
No bachelor's going to gain weight on his own cooking.
And he always looks so mysteriously satisfied.
Something very strange is going on with your Major Nelson.
What do you think I've been trying to tell you all this time?
Well, I think I know a way to find out what it is.
Hmm.
Okay.
Thanks.
How was your flight, Major Nelson?
Fine, sir.
We'll make some more tests next week.
Oh, I'm ready any time you are.
Are you free for dinner tonight?

It's a trap.
He's not hungry.
He's looking for Jeannie.
Wait a minute.
You know and you're not gonna stop him?
Oh, don't worry.
I'm giving a dinner party tonight.
And Dr. Bellows and his wife are coming, and I want you to come and bring a girl.
Okay, but who?
Who are you gonna bring?

Oh, master, you are sure you would not mind if I went alone?
No.
Your master insists upon it.
My master is such a sweet, darling liar!
Now, Jeannie, take it easy.
Don't get excited.
Why does Major Nelson want to get rid of me tonight?
Well, he doesn't wanna get rid of you.
It's just, he wants you to see The Arabian Nights.
It's It's about your own hometown.
He is trying to trick me, but you will tell me the truth.
Me?
Me?
Well, I am telling you the truth.
I would never Jeannie, what are you doing?
I am waiting for you to tell me why Major Nelson does not want me around tonight.
I did tell you.
You know that I would never lie Jeannie, you've gotta stop being so suspicious.
I mean, that's not like you to Jeannie, what are you doing to me?
Now, wait a minute.
You know I'm telling you the truth.
I would never lie to you.
I never lied to you in my Oh!

Ooh!
Thank you, Major Healey.
My pants.
My pants.

I said I was gonna be busy tonight, and I am.
Having a dinner party.
Who told you?
Ha-ha, it is true.
Oh.
No, no, it It's not a dinner party.

Please let me stay.
I will hide.
Hide?
Well, I can't let you stay, Jeannie.
You see, Mrs. Bellows is very a suspicious woman, and she's coming here looking for trouble.
If you're gonna be here, she's gonna find it.
Oh, but who will cook your dinner?
I've hired a sweet, little old lady to come in and fix it.
Oh, well, no one can cook a meal like I can, master.
You want Yeah, honestly, don't Don't Don't worry about it.
It's okay.
I will just peak in and check and see how she is doing.
Oh, no, no, no, really.
That's sweet of you, Jeannie, but, y-you know if you don't hurry, you're gonna be late for that play.
Very well, master.
Hee-hee!
Good.
Thanks Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Hello, Kathryn.
Did anyone come in here?
No, darling.
Were you expecting someone?
No, no, no.
You'll never know how pleased I was to see you after all these months.
Oh?
Why?
Why?
Oh, I got hungry.
Did you?
Yeah.
You're one of the best cooks I've ever known.
You know, I'm good at anything I'm interested in.
Oh!
Well, I I don't wanna keep you from your work.
Uh, I want this dinner to be particularly smashing tonight.
It's going to be.

Very nice to meet you Ooh, hors d'oeuvres.
Hey, she's all right, huh?
Yeah.
She's a skydiver.
I'm sorry about what happened with Jeannie this afternoon.
I would have held out longer, but I started to catch cold.
That's all right.
Everything worked out.
You mean you got her to go to the theatre even after she knew?
That's right.
Oh, boy.
You should write an encyclopedia on women.
That's probably Dr. Bellows.
Hang on.
Dr. Bellows.
Good evening, Major Nelson.
Hello, major.
Oh, you're a darling to have us over on such short notice.
Is this where I put my wrap?
Amanda, you don't have a wrap.
Oh, I'm cursed.
How perfectly ridiculous of me.
I left my wrap in the car, didn't I, dear?
Uh, Amanda, shall we join the others?
Oh, yes, yes.
Uh Uh, Miss Abernathy, uh, this is Mrs. Bellows and Dr. Bellows.
How do you do?
Hello.
Oh, you must think we're terribly rude inviting ourselves over for dinner like this.
But I simply had to see how a bachelor was going to handle a dinner party on such short notice.
Oh, I have a friend that drops in from time to time to cook for me.
I'd like to meet your friend.
Oh, would you, sir?
Uh, Kathryn?
Yes?
I'd like you to meet the Bellows.
Hi, Kathryn.
Uh, this is Kathryn Golato, Mrs. Bellows.
How do you do?
Ah, Dr. Bellows.
How do you do?
Ah, how do you do?
So you're the girl who's putting weight on our major?
Putting weight?
Yeah, well, yes.
She's one of the best cooks in Cocoa Beach.
Yeah.
Wait'll you taste her cooking.
What are we having?
Uh, what Kathryn usually prepares for me.
A real French dinner.
Italian dinner.
Uh, an Italian dinner, French style.
I better start getting things ready.
Yes.
Thank you.
So that's the answer.
Uh, the answer?
Hmm.
Does she cook for you often, major?
Oh, yes.
All the time.
All the time.
Tony, how do you turn on the oven?
Yes.
Excuse me for just a moment, please?
Ah, she always has a hard time r-remembering how to turn it on.
You know, darling, my woman's intuition tells me we're going to be, uh, awfully glad we came.
Heh.
Mmm.
Terrific tomato juice.
Well, uh, whatever she's cooking out there, it sure smells good.
Ha-ha-ha!
Wait'll you taste it.
Mmm.
I've always loved Italian-French cooking.
Mmm.
Here you are.
Oh, you all go ahead.
Don't wait for me.
Ah!
It simply looks marvelous.
Well, you certainly gain a lot of weight on On food like this.
So much for a woman's intuition.
Hmm.
Mmm, good, good.
Good, real good.
Thank you.
It is good, isn't it?
I don't know that I've tasted anything like it.
I don't know either.
I'm sure of one thing.
What's that, my dear?
It'll teach you to pay more attention to my intuition.
I'll get the dessert.
Oh, could we have some water too, please?
Oh, yes.
I'd like some more water myself.
Oh, well, yeah, wait Wait'll you, uh, see the soufflÃ©.

It's hot.
Okay.
I'll get the forks.
All right.
Yes, sir.
Light as a feather.
Ah.
Excuse me.
Jeannie, I know you're in here.
Come on out.
Do you know what you've done to me?
You've ruined me, that's what you've done to me.
You did this deliberately, didn't you?
Huh?
You can't have just everything go right, can you?
You You know what your problem is?
You're You're jealous.
And you're interfering, and Would you like a cup of coffee, sir?
Your stove is jealous and interfering?
My stove?
No.
It's just an ordinary, everyday How 'bout some mock turtle soup?
Hm.
In this house, anything could be anything.
One thing I'm sure of, you're not gaining any weight on this food.
There's more here than meets the eye, and I'm going to find out what it is.
Oh, it's nothing, really, sir.
Then how do you explain the fact that you live here all alone and you're gaining weight?
Well, it's, uh It's the desserts I eat.
I'm very big on desserts.
Now shall we, uh, serve the other people?
Beautiful, isn't it?
Thank you.
Mmm.
This is the most delicious cake I've ever tasted in my whole life.
It's fantastic.
Mm, delicious.
Well, I-I must warn you, it's very fattening.
Who cares?
Major, I owe you an apology.
If I ate desserts like this, I think I'd gain weight too.
There's no reason to apologize, doctor.
Everybody makes mistakes.
I must have this recipe.
I'd like it myself.
What do you mean?
You didn't bake it?
No.
Didn't come from any bakery.
Who baked it?
Oh, I baked it.
I baked it.
Oh, major, how marvelous.
But, you know, there's a flavor in there I can't quite identify.
What is it?
Oh, I'm I'm sorry.
Uh, this recipe has been passed down from generation to generation in my family.
If I, uh If I disclosed it, I would be breaking an oath.
I understand.
Can I take a piece home with me?
Oh, of course.
For my mommy.
For your mommy?
Oh, of course.
Yes, um After dinner, would anyone like to play bridge or, uh, poker?
Let's play jacks.
Jacks?
I wanna play jacks.
You wanna play Jacks?
Huh!
I don't wanna play jacks.
I wanna play tag.
I wanna play Pin the Tail on the Donkey.
Well, let's play Post Office.
I want more cake.
More cake.
More cake.
Wait a minute.
You're it, right?
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, you're Roger, see that the girls get home all right, huh?
Okay.
I loved your party, Tony.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Come on, Kathy.
Ooh!
Thank you very much for inviting me to your party.
I had a real good time.
I'm glad you could come.
I am too.
It was keen.
You'll You'll be able to make it home all right, won't you?
Oh, sure, we just live down the block.
We'll We'll run all the way.
Heh!
I'll race you home.
Last one home's a dirty bird.
I don't wanna race.
I'm tired.
No wonder you're tired.
I saw you playing Spin the Bottle with that rotten Katy Golato.
Yeah?
And I saw you playing hopscotch with Roger Healey.
I did not.
You did too.
I did not.
You did too.
I did not!
You did too!
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
Send him in.
Dr. Bellows?
Oh.
Yes?
I'm Charles Fakeling with the National Bureau of Pure Food and Drugs.
Hmm.
Yes, Mr. Fakeling.
Um, what can I do for you?
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You do have a top security clearance, don't you, doctor?
Of course.
Doctor, does your wife cook?
Uh we eat out most of the time.
Do you like to cook?
Well, I I barbecue occasionally, but Well, I don't see any need Do you like to bake?
Bake?
Cakes?
I never baked a cake in all my life.
Will you tell me what this is about?
A few days ago, your wife brought a piece of cake into a laboratory in Cocoa Beach to have analyzed.
I know.
But I don't see what that's gotta do with you.
She simply wanted to know the ingredients, so she could That's what brought me here, doctor.
One of the ingredients.
I don't understand.
We don't either.
We can't identify it.
Heh-heh.
Surely our laboratory here will help you out.
We tried them.
We also tried the lab at the CIA and the FBI.
There's something very unusual about this ingredient.
It doesn't respond to any of our known tests.
That's incredible.
I'll tell you something even more incredible: A professor of Medicine at Harvard thinks that this unknown ingredient is similar in molecular structure to mepatharin.
Mepatharin?
I'm not familiar with it.
You know that project they're working on to arrest old age?
Oh, of course.
And that isn't all.
They think this substance will do even more than that.
They think it will restore youth.
They think there's some kind of property in it that arrests deterioration.
Doctor, this could be one of the major breakthroughs of our generation.
I want to know where that substance came from.
So do I. Now, hm-hm, come along.
I'm going to take you to the one man who can tell us.
Come.
What's going on around?
Jeannie, what are you doing now?
Oh, I am cleaning the closet, master.
Yeah, well, I can see that.
You do not need any of these old things.
Yeah.
What are you?
Look, there's my best squash racket.
Oh, master, when was this taken?
Uh, oh, my graduation in high school.
Oh, you were so handsome.
Uh, yeah.
Do you know what you did to?
Do you have any pictures of yourself when you were younger?
No, Jeannie.
They're not My mother has 'em.
I am sure that you were adorable.
Yes, I'm sure I can just see you now.
Dressed in a cute, little outfit with a A collar and a hat.
Oh!
Jeannie.
Aw, what?
Thanks, Jeannie.
Yes?
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Well Dr. Bellows, just sit down here, and we'll discuss this rationally.
Thank you.
Uh, believe me, sir, if I knew how to stop old age, I'd tell you.
I'd tell you.
Major Nelson, look at yourself.
You look 20 years younger.
Eh, 20 years younger than what?
Why are you dressed that way?
Yes Yeah, uh If you'll give us this formula, you'll be handsomely rewarded.
I'm prepared to offer you $100,000, plus an equitable royalty arrangement.
Yeah, well, sir, I'm not interested in the money.
Oh.
I'm not interested in the money, sir.
I would give it to you free, if I If I could.
I I just can't.
Of course.
Shall we say $200,000, plus a royalty arrangement?
Dr. Bellows, would you explain to him.
Major Nelson, the ingredient was in your cake.
Would you like to explain that?
I certainly would.
But I can't.
But my theory is, sir, that, uh, when Mrs. Bellows took that piece of cake to have it analyzed at the laboratory, one of the technicians accidentally, uh, poured the ingredients that you're looking for into the cake, and, uh Major, heh-heh, you can do better than that.
We're wasting our time.
If you change your mind, get in touch with me.
You could do your country a great service.
Ah, major, you You could do yourself a big service too.
I want to see you in my office tomorrow morning.
Yes, sir.
Jeannie!
Yes, master.
Oh.
Jeannie, I want you to bake me a cake.
A cake?
Yeah.
You have had enough sweets for one day.
What you need is a nice, hot bowl of chicken soup.
I don't want any chicken soup.
Yes, chicken soup.
Jeannie!
I want you to Remember that cake you baked for me?
Yes?
I want you to bake me another one exactly like it.
There's an ingredient in it that I need.
Oh, which one?
Well, I I don't know which one.
It was your cake.
Oh, but you see, master, I never follow a recipe.
I believe the best cooks have an instinct.
If you follow a recipe It's very important that you remember every ingredient that went into it.
It's very important.
It is?
You see, without knowing it, you've discovered the Fountain of Youth.
Uh, there was something in that cake that made people young again.
Well, uh, let's see.
Uh, was it the flour?
I don't know.
E-eggs?
No, no, no.
Wait a minute.
I think I have it.
Okay.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Does that look like it, master?
Yeah, oh, yes, it certainly does.
Hey, that is beautiful.
I-I-I'm gonna cut it now.
Jeannie, you're the best genie a master ever had.
Oh.
Do you know what this means?
Nobody's ever gonna get old again.
Mm-hm.
How does it taste, master?
Oh, no.
No.
Jeannie!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
Do something.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
Good morning.
Good morning, sir.
He is here.
What do you think you're doing?
Master.
Major Healey is calling you.
It is urgent.
Hello.
Hello?
!
Hi, Tony.
Hey, do you have your radio on?
No, no, you have yours on.
What's the matter?
Jeannie said it was urgent.
Ah, are you kidding?
Urgent's not the word for it.
Now, listen, don't make any plans for tonight.
The greatest party-thrower in Cocoa Beach is throwing a wild mod party.
Yeah.
Wh-who is that?
Me.
Huh?
Well, what do you know about giving a mod party?
What is there to know?
A bunch of friends of mine came down to Florida to see me.
They're bringing some girls over to my place.
I thought, you know, might make it a real party.
Oh, great.
No brass, no psychiatric observers and definitely no uniforms.
Strictly mod all the way.
Carniby Street, right?
Yeah, well, it sounds great.
Uh, bring Jeannie and some ice.
Oh, thank you, Major Healey.
Oh, this is a pleasure, Jeannie.
Okay, Tony?
Yeah, uh Yeah, okay.
All right, I'll see you.
Oh, master.
A party.
A party!
This thing's not attached to anything.
Is it not wonderful?
There's no cord.
Oh, I'm so excited.
I love parties.
Oh!
All right, we have to get down to business.
And I will make my hair brunette Yeah, I-I'd rather you didn't blink up anything, Jeannie.
Here, I want you to take one of these credit cards and go down to Cocoa Oh, they are so beautiful.
I think I like the red one the best.
Well, believe me, it's not the color that counts.
Now, you take that down shopping in Cocoa Beach, and get yourself something mod to wear tonight.
But why, master?
All I have to do is Yes, yes, I-I know that, but I'd rather you wouldn't.
Now, you see, the important thing at Roger's party tonight is the clothes that people will be wearing.
It has to be just right.
You'll do that for me, won't you?
If you say so, master.
Okay.
Shopping for mod will be such fun.
Yeah.
What is "mod"?
Well, I really don't have time to go into it.
The salesgirl will help you.
Oh, just think.
I will be the only genie at the party dressed in mod.
Yeah.
Just received these mental stress analysis reports.
I want you to run them through the computer.
Thanks.
Hey, Roge.
Oh, yeah.
Something wrong with your ankle?
No, but there's something wrong with my neck.
I'm getting ready for the frug dance tonight.
A little practice Oh, am I excited.
All those great girls tonight, huh.
I'm kind of excited too.
This will be the first mod party I've ever been to.
It will be an experience.
Oh, listen, that's putting it mildly.
Hey, you're gonna love the guys.
They're a great bunch, really.
Are they college buddies?
No, no.
Uh, from high school?
No, no, grammar school.
Of course, they're a little older now.
Yeah, well, I hope so.
Yeah, listen, this party is kind of a class reunion.
Boy, it's going to be great, seeing old Porky Hansen again.
He used to be the classroom cutup.
Ah, I'll never forget the time he poured a bucket of tadpoles over our biology teacher's head.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Wh-what's he doing now?
Well, he's the head of his own model agency.
Yeah.
They're gonna paint my office.
Help me move the furniture around.
Yeah.
Good old Porky.
Even in grammar school, he got all the beautiful girls.
Two girls fought a duel over him with mud pies.
Give me a hand with this, will you?
The principal's daughter wanted to elope with him when they were 7 years old.
But now, to think he has his own model agency.
All those beautiful girls.
Boy, I can't wait to see what my date is gonna look like.
Come in.
Tony.
Hey, Roger, how are you?
Carter, how are you?
Good to see you.
What brings you to town?
Uh, let's see, the last time I saw you was last year at the meeting of the inter-branch relations Well, that's it.
It's that time of year again.
We're having our annual little get-together tonight.
Well, we can't make it.
Not tonight, no.
Didn't you get the notice?
Did we get the notice he sent out?
Last month, I got the notice.
I put it in my drawer and never looked at it again.
It's in here someplace.
Can't you make it another night?
Tomorrow night maybe.
We can't make it.
This is Dr. Bellows' baby.
If you can't make it, check with him.
You know how he looks forward to it.
I know.
I know how he is.
Give you a little advice.
If you're not there tonight, you'd better have an excuse.
A good excuse.
Yeah, we will.
I mean, we'll work out something.
See you later.
The nerve of Dr. Bellows having his meeting on the night of my mod party!
Roger, he's had this meeting set up for the last year.
That's what I mean.
He had a whole year to pick another date.
What are we gonna do?
We're going to the meeting.
Oh, no, we're not.
Not me, I'm not gonna let my buddies down.
No, sirree.
You remember last year's meeting?
Mrs. Bellows and her soggy, soggy hors d'oeuvres?
Boy, what are we gonna do?
The one I feel sorry for is Jeannie.
She really had her heart set on going to this party tonight.
How are we gonna get out of this thing?
How?
Well, you know Dr. Bellows.
Even if the meeting is unimportant, all the brass will be there.
If we don't show up, we'll never hear the end of it.
Mrs. Bellows will see to it.
We could call in sick.
Yeah, we'd have to show up on crutches.
That's the only way he'd ever believe us.
I know the nurse at the infirmary.
She could lend us a couple Hey, wait a minute.
Remember Dr. Bellows said the last time we had our physical, that we needed some outdoor activities?
Yeah.
Well, we'll just tell him that We're going hunting, sir.
Hunting?
You know, camping out, the great outdoors.
Surrounded by fresh air, just as you prescribed.
Hm, I see.
Uh, how long have you been planning this trip?
Four weeks.
Four months.
Four weeks.
Four months.
I-I really can't understand how we forgot about your little get-together tonight, sir.
Well, I understand it.
You do?
Of course.
It was because of your unconscious need to break out into the open.
It drove tonight's gathering completely from your mind.
Oh, yeah, completely.
Yeah.
It sounds so simple when you explain it, sir.
Well, after all, it is my profession.
The dynamics of human relations.
Well, you're the doctor.
Well, all right, gentlemen, I, um I'll make your excuses at the meeting tonight.
Oh, Mrs. Bellows is gonna be terribly disappointed, but, uh, your mental and physical well-being is far more important than attending our little gathering.
Well, I knew you would understand, sir.
Thanks, sir.
Tell Mrs. Bellows, we're going to miss her hors d'oeuvres.
You were brilliant.
I mean brilliant.
Oh, I feel a heel, lying to Dr. Bellows.
Are you kidding?
With one stoke, you got us out of a dull evening, into Into the mod party of the year.
Anyway, we weren't lying.
We are going hunting.
What if Dr. Bellows finds out about the party?
Will you stop worrying?
There's not a chance in the world.
I don't think they're quite the right shape, but thank you.
I'll look around a bit.
Good morning.
May I help you, madam?
Yes, please.
I would like to buy a mod outfit like the mannequin is wearing.
Certainly, madam.
Here we are.
Oh, well, I'm terribly sorry to bother you, but may I have the dress without the patches?
The dress doesn't come without the patches.
Oh, I think it does now.
Madam, I dressed that mannequin my Well, I don't understand.
It's a Phyllis DeBeck and she always puts patches on her designs.
I'm sorry, I'm positive I haven't another one like it.
Oh, look.
I think I found it.
You can pay the cashier.
Thank you.
Oh, can you tell me, please.
Where can I buy a mod jacket for my master?
Uh, for a man.
In the men's section, over there.
Thank you.
Nope.
It's not far-out enough for Herman.
Sorry.
It's the furthest-out tie we carry.
Sir Wow, that's kicky!
You're guy must be a real ding-dong.
"Ding-dong"?
A bell-ringer.
You know, with it, going!
Oh, "going".
Oh, yes.
Major Nelson and I are going to Major Healey's house tonight for a party.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, are you ready?
Almost, master.
We don't want to be late.
There.
Here I am.
Hey, hey, that's Do you like it?
Oh, it's adorable.
Thank you.
Oh, master.
What?
You cannot go in this.
Oh, well, Jeannie.
It's a tuxedo, I-I think I can get away with it.
I have a surprise for you.
Yeah, well, this is all I have, see.
Oh.
How 'bout that?
I can't wear that.
I-I don't have anything to go with it.
Oh, yes, master.
Oh.
Jeannie, I can't wear this.
Oh, yes, master.
You look adorable in it.
Look at that.
It fits you beautifully.
Well, it's not It's not really bad, is it?
I like the color too.
Yes, how 'bout the bell-bottoms?
Beautiful, beautiful.
Oops.
Oops.
Shall we go?
Okay.
You know, you haven't changed a bit, old buddy.
Well, you haven't changed either, Porky.
Your hair is a little thinner.
Well, you're a little heavy around here.
Still keeping the same company.
Oh, hey, this way.
Oh, he used to be a killer in grammar school.
Hi, Mary.
Hey, Harry.
Oh, look at this.
business.
Wha?
Business?
Oh, I would like to be a partner in your business.
Come on over here.
Do you still play the bass?
Oh, I've fooled around a little bit.
Hey, cut the music!
Oh, come on.
No, come on, now.
I want you to hear my main man here.
Oh, no.
Go get him, Roge!
Come on.
All right.
All right.
Paul, let's show 'em, shall we?
Okay, ready, Paul?
Sure.
Are you sure you're ready?
Well, I'm not ready, Paul.
Paul's ready.
It's all good so far.
Aw, yeah, do it.
This is so exciting.
It is the best mod party I have ever been to.
Well, you haven't been there yet.
Hey, Tony.
Hiya, Jeannie.
Oh, you look great.
Oh, you look just great.
Meet Paul, my old friend Porky, and this is Maureen, and this is Susie.
Oh, you look great.
Why is he not dancing with a girl?
Funny chick.
Where did you find her?
Well, actually in a bottle on the beach.
In a bot Ha-ha-ha.
She's a little She's She's nuts.
Hey, this a lot better than Dr. Bellows' dull old party, isn't it?
How long are you gonna be able to keep that up?
Oh, it's hard to stop, once you get the music in your soul.
You just gotta keep going.
Roge, you're not playing anymore.
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not playing.
Oh, did you bring the ice, Jeannie?
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot all about it.
Yes.
No, I Not here.
Hey, kids, dig the crazy new dance.
Yeah!
Yeah.
Yeah, dig it.
Hey, we're out of ice.
Why don't you look in the refrigerator.
Right you are.
Who turned on this refrigerator?
I'm doing this under protest, Amanda.
You're asking me to distrust one of the men in my command.
Two of the men in your command.
Oh, this is a waste of time.
At this very moment  Major Nelson and Major Healey are hunting.
Hunting what?
They wouldn't dare.
Open that door.
Alfred, we have work to do.
Well, where are they?
Oh, this reminds me of a party Nero gave once.
Except that everyone wore togas.
I certainly hope so for their sake.
Oh, wait a minute, Judy, Judy, Judy, Judy.
I'm going to drink a toast.
Uh.
A toast to Dr. Bellows.
A toast to Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows is here.
He's here.
Dr. Bellows can't be here.
I didn't invite him.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, we should've gotten the crutches.
Jeannie, do something.
Go on, do something!
I will blink him to the top of a pyramid.
No, no, no.
Uh, uh, dress us in a hunting outfit.
Oh, yeah, hunting, hunting.
We can go hunting.
Yes, master.
Thanks, Jeannie.
Hey, these clothes really are mod.
Nice, Jeannie.
Jeannie, would you mind?
Something more modern than this.
I like 'em.
Quickly.
Yes, master.
Wait a minute Hey, these are kind of cute.
Jeannie, this is not what I had in mind.
Couldn't you get us a?
Show me that dance again.
Oh.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, Porky.
What happened to Porky?
Jeannie, get him back.
Get him back.
It was an accident.
Oh, there he is.
Wow, what a groovy dance.
Come on, baby.
Hey, Porky.
Wait a minute.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows.
I'm so glad you could You could drop by.
We just didn't happen to drop by, major.
This is an official call.
Oh.
Amanda, if you don't mind.
All right, darling.
Tell them why we're here.
Major Nelson, you missed the meeting at my house tonight, because you said that you and Major Healey were going hunting.
Yes, well, we were just leaving, sir.
What about your party, major?
What about our party, major?
Huh?
Party?
Oh, this is not, uh, Roger's party.
He had some friends drop in from out of town and since we were going hunting, he very generously turned his apartment over to them for their party.
Very generously.
Then why are you here?
Uh, why are we here now?
Our car broke down.
Both of our cars.
You mean to tell me that you're actually going hunting dressed like that?
Carrying bows and arrows?
Uh, yes, it's the, uh The Ancient Hunter's Bow and Arrow Club.
The Ancient Hunter's Bow and Arrow Club?
Yes, it is an ancient club.
We can only hunt with bows and arrows.
I told you there'd be a logical explanation for this.
I haven't heard it yet.
Tell me, where did you plan to go hunting?
Uh, well, just a A swamp.
A swamp.
Twenty miles from here.
Twenty miles.
Too bad about our cars breaking down.
We can't go now.
Oh, yes, you can.
I'm gonna drive you there.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, you come right with me.
No, no, no, no.
Well, here we are.
Yeah, here we are.
Yeah, here we are.
Mm.
You really shouldn't have gone to all that trouble, sir.
It's no trouble.
After all, I'm the one who prescribed this.
Yeah, well, we'll never forget that, doc.
Well, I'd better get back.
I don't like to leave Amanda alone at the party.
By the time I return, she'll have everyone psychoanalyzed.
Well, good hunting, gentlemen.
It's raining.
Very good observation, Roger.
You know what you're problem is?
You're basically insecure.
I mean, I can tell by the funny hairdo and the strange clothes you have on.
Oh, I bet you had a very unhappy childhood.
You know, you really should have a talk with my husband.
You mean the shrink in the uniform?
The what in the what?
I mean, the head-scrambler, the wig-picker.
Are you talking about my husband?
You know your problem, lady?
What?
You ain't loose.
Oh.
Gotta relax.
Oh, is that it?
Yeah.
Oh.
Roger!
Roger!
In here.
Get out of there and give me a hand here.
Are you kidding?
It's the only dry place in here.
Help me set it up, will you?
Pull it around.
Use this rope.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Throw it over there.
Throw it on top of that limb.
You catch it.
I'll tie the top of this to it.
And you can pull it up.
I'll go to catch it.
Okay!
Throw it over here.
Come on.
I'm ready.
Throw it.
Okay!
Okay, I got it.
I got it.
Okay?
Okay, Roge, let it go.
Okay.
Wait, wait.
Can you hear me?
I'm pulling, I'm pulling.
I got it.
What?
What are you?
What are you doing?
Roger!
I'm trying to fix the tent, and you're fooling around.
Hold it, Roge!
Oh, oh, young lady.
I-I don't Well, I used to do the Twist.
Oh, I Oh, oh, oh!
Well, I  When I think of all those beautiful women back in my apartment, then I think of Dr. Bellows, I could kill No, I think I'll just cry instead.
They must be having a ball back there.
Why don't we go home.
Why don't we go home!
What are you?
Do you know what you're doing, anyway?
Don't you remember our survival course?
Yeah, what are you doing?
Pre-Columbian Indians used to start fires like this.
Take a bite.
Take a bite?
Are you kidding?
Oh, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Come on.
Let me see, you were saying Darling, come on, dance.
Oh, you don't know what you're missing.
It's such fun.
Amanda, I'm in the middle of a very interesting psychoanalysis.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
Have fun.
Now, dear, tell me, how long have you had this compulsion to be a football player?
Hi, everybody.
We're back!
We're ba!
Oh, hi, Dr. Bellows.
What are you doing here?
I had a feeling you might return.
I told you they weren't interested in hunting.
Oh, we were.
We were.
Well, then, why did you come back?
Well, we got our quota.
It was nice of you to drive us out there.
Really, nice of you, in the rain with all that, but There we are.
See, doc?
Look what we brought back.
