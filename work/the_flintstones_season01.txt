{START OF EPISODE 01}
Do I see a split?
Just keep your eye on the ball, Barney-boy.
Oh boy, good old Sunday.
Nothing to do but lazy around and read the Sunday paper.
- Honey?
- Yes, Fred?
- Did you see the Sunday paper?
- No, Fred, it hasn't come yet.
Mr. Flintstone, here's your paper.
Catch!
Did you get your paper, dear?
Yeah, and I'm lucky it only comes once a week.
Now let's see what the rock market is doing.
I see the Dodgers lost again.
Fore!
- Barney!
- Hiya, Fred, neighbor-pal.
What are you supposed to be doing besides annoying me on my day off?
Practicing golf.
Watch this.
Fore!
One more "fore" out of you and I'll give you what for.
Twenty-five hundred people in Bedrock and I have to pick this pebble-brain for a neighbor.
Hey, how about this!
"Fred Flintstone to captain bowling finals".
Fore!
Hold it, Fred.
I gotta play them where they lie.
Pooch your mouth up a little.
Why, you I'll pooch your pointed head up if I catch you.
You know what's wrong with you, friend Freddie?
You're a nervous wreck.
- And you need a hobby, like mine.
- I got a hobby.
It's peace and quiet on Sunday.
And if I don't get it, I'm gonna break you in little pieces.
I said, "Barney".
What are you doing now?
It's my hobby I tried to tell you about.
I build things, and it keeps my nimble little fingers busy.
- What do you think of it?
- Before I think of it, what is it?
That little invention will make me the first man to take off into the blue.
Well, I got a little invention of my own which is called "a rap on the noggin," if you don't cut out the noise.
Into the blue?
That thing?
- Will it work?
- It'll work, Freddie-friend on account of the stickle bolts connected to the toggle switch the toggle switch connected to the ratchet the ratchet rod connected to the tension trod which in turn is connected to the flywheel.
Then, zoom!
Before you know it, you're airborne.
Now what do you think of my invention, Fred?
You still insist you're gonna fly in that crazy contraption?
- Just like the birds.
- Listen, neighbor.
I'm gonna save you a lot of work and inventing.
I'm gonna fix it so you won't need that thing to fly in.
It works like this.
My fist bone connected with your jawbone, and zoom!
Before you know it, you are airborne.
Now let me get some rest, you poor excuse for a neighbor.
Poor Fred.
He's a bundle of nerves.
The tension trod connected to the flywheel.
Fly just like the birds.
Looked like a dinosaur-eggbeater to me.
Nice flying weather, neighbor.
Look, Freddie, the hard way.
No hands.
And no brains, either.
It works!
He's really flying.
Hey, Barney!
Barney, buddy-pal!
What do you say now, Freddie-boy?
What do I say?
We did it!
We're a success!
- We?
- Right, Barney-boy.
With my brains and your nimble fingers, we'll make a fortune.
Think of it.
No more traffic problems.
Fly right out the window each morning.
There'll be two in every cave, a "his" and a "hers".
- We'll form a corporation.
- Yeah, but l I will be the president and I'll make you vice-president in charge of production.
Vice-president?
I even got a name for it.
Listen to this, Barney-boy: The Flintstone Flyer.
I was gonna call it the Barney-copter.
Not a bad suggestion, but it ain't got the hard sell.
We'll stick to the Flintstone Flyer.
Speaking of flying how about the prexy taking this jalopy for a trial spin?
- But do you think you're ready for a solo?
- Out of my way.
- Anything you can do, I can do better.
- Look, it ain't easy Explain it to me once.
I will show you I'm ready to solo.
What's to explain?
Just start pumping, and when you're up to speed you take off.
That's all there is to it?
There's one other thing.
Details.
Don't bother me with details.
See me when I get back.
I just wanted to tell him how to land.
If he takes off, that is.
Hey, you're too fat, Fred!
Details, see me when I get back.
Back to the drawing board.
Hiya, Fred.
How's the grounded eagle today?
Why didn't you tell me you didn't get all the bugs out of that thing before you let me take it up?
There's no bugs in it.
You're just too fat.
Yeah, well, I'm no fathead.
I resign.
Get yourself another boy for president.
Have it your way, Freddie.
From now on, the new president's gonna be me.
Yours truly, "Buzz" Barney.
Roger, wilco and O-U-T, out.
By the way, the boys are gonna miss you tonight.
What do you mean miss me tonight?
How are you gonna bowl in that crash condition?
Are you kidding?
I'll bowl tonight even if I have to push the ball down the alley with my nose.
Put it there, Fred.
Spoken like the true captain of the Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Team.
Fred, I'm home.
- Hi, Wilma.
- How are you feeling?
Great.
I never felt better in my life.
I'm so glad.
I thought sure you wouldn't be able to make it tonight.
You think a little scratch would keep me from going?
And to think I almost returned the tickets.
- Tickets?
What do I need tickets for?
- Don't be silly.
How do you expect to go to the opera without tickets?
Opera?
Did you say "opera"?
Of course.
You knew we were going with the Rubbles tonight.
Tonight?
When else?
We've had the tickets for a month.
Does Barney know about this?
Naturally.
He bought the tickets.
Now what did I do?
Nothing.
I just wanted to tell you I'm not going bowling tonight.
- Wow, can I be captain of the team?
- You're not going either.
We're not going bowling because you had to buy tickets for the opera, for tonight.
I forgot.
Yeah, you forgot.
And we can forget about the bowling championship thanks to you, opera-lover.
We'll be drummed out of the Rockhead and Quarry bowling team for this.
I'd be better off if I broke my leg.
Then at least I'd have had an excuse.
Hey, maybe you got a fractured skull and don't know it?
I don't have one, but you will when the boys hear about this.
Wait a minute.
Maybe I do have something wrong with my noggin.
You do?
And maybe it'll show up tonight just when we're leaving.
I don't get it.
You'll get it if you don't pay attention.
We're going bowling yet.
Now listen.
A- bowling we will go A- bowling we will go Heigh ho Answer the door, dear.
It must be the Rubbles.
Okay, honey.
- Hi, neighbors.
- Hi, Fred.
La donna e mobile Faniculi, fanicula Faniculi, fanicula - Love that opera.
- I can hardly wait for the first cadenza.
Aren't you boys overdoing it a little?
Let's hurry or we'll be late.
Have you got the tickets, Fred?
- Got the tickets.
- Yes, indeed.
Fanicula, faniculi, faniculi - Love your dress.
- Thanks.
Fred, what's wrong?
Fred, speak to me.
He can't talk, Wilma.
He's in a state of shock.
- From the crash?
- What else?
With thick skulls, it sets in a lot later.
Quick, let's get him to bed.
Are you kidding?
Miss the opera on account of my little dizzy spell?
No, you three run along.
I'll be fine.
What?
And leave you alone?
Are you kidding?
Me leave without my buddy?
Look, you two go ahead.
You're all dressed up for it, anyway.
I'll baby-sit Fred's shook-up head.
Sure, that's a good idea, pal.
Why waste the tickets?
Now go ahead.
That's an order.
- You're sure you'll be all right?
- What can happen with Barney here?
Yeah, they don't call me "Band-Aid" Barney for nothing.
What do you think, Betty?
Well, it's only for a few hours, and Barney will sit with him.
I feel terrible doing this.
- Hey, Fred, it worked.
- My idea, wasn't it?
With head bloodied but unbowed, you bowl tonight my captain, my captain.
Hurry up and get your bowling ball.
I feel hot tonight.
What?
How are we gonna get into town?
The girls got the car.
Hey, how about hitchhiking?
Sure, and maybe the wives will give us a lift back home.
Don't you get it?
We gotta go to town, bowl, and beat them back here.
I got it.
Simple.
We go the over-land route.
Not your crazy eggbeater again?
Sure.
I fixed it.
I added king-sized flippers so it could carry a heavy load even a fat one.
If this gadget doesn't work I'm gonna unload a heavy load of five fat knuckles on your nose.
Mr. Copilot, ready for the takeoff?
Better start praying if it don't.
- We're off!
- Not from where I sit.
Maybe we ought to drop the bowling balls.
- Yeah, on your head.
- Flap your arms up and down.
You mean like this?
Yes, it's working, Fred.
That's all we needed, a little extra power.
How about that, Fred?
- The Barney-copter does it again.
- I got news for you, Veep.
I just re-elected myself president of the Flintstone Flyer Corporation.
You know, I feel like a heel.
Fred in bed, and me off enjoying myself.
And Barney offering to stay with him right after he said how much he wanted to go to the opera.
I'd feel better if I knew Fred was all right.
Me, too.
Let's call home at intermission.
Step aside, Pagliacci, whilst the captain warms up.
Do I see a split?
Just keep your eye on the ball, Barney-boy.
You're the greatest, Fred!
The old master strikes again.
Hey, old master, how about something to cool you off?
The way I'm going, nothing can cool me off tonight.
Okay, let me have one with a couple of straws.
One frosty one coming up.
With two straws, please.
- Thanks.
- That's all right.
Ball on target.
Bombs away.
- Did I do good, Fred?
- Great, just great.
Now would you like to try bowling like the rest of us?
Oh, boy.
Big strike coming up.
So is a big wind.
Close your mouth.
- Bravo!
- Encore!
Isn't it beautiful, Wilma?
All I can think of is poor Fred home suffering.
If it'll make you feel any better, let's go out and call them right now.
You know, I would feel better.
Maybe there's a phone in that bowling alley across the street.
Oh, dear.
I hope Fred's all right.
Would you stop worrying?
He is all right.
Poor Fred.
I hope he's not running a fever.
Am I hot tonight!
It's so noisy, I can't hear a thing.
There's no answer.
I'm worried.
Keep your eye on the king of the tenpins.
Just hold on to the ball this time, or I'll crown you king pinhead.
Oh, no!
Why, you crazy Fred, look.
Over there, in the phone booth.
The wives.
The wives?
- We better go home.
Something's wrong.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.
We'll just Wilma, look.
Isn't that Fred and Barney?
If they see us, we're dead.
If they catch us, we'll wish we were.
They're heading this way.
Think of something, quick.
You're the captain.
- Hey, we can use that broom.
- Broom?
What a time to get neat!
So, he had to baby-sit a sick friend?
It's gonna be two sick friends.
Surprise, husbands!
Now it's my turn.
- Good heavens!
- It's not them.
Have we met?
- They don't allow pick-ups in here.
- Ja, this is a respectable place.
- We thought you were our husbands.
- Yeah, both of them.
Is that the way you always greet your husbands?
Ja.
"Hello, darling," pow?
The average husband can stand just so many pows.
Ja, then he takes a powder.
Get it?
- That was very funny, no?
- No.
- Sorry.
Excuse us.
- You looked like our husbands.
If you're looking for your husbands why don't you try looking at home, where you belong?
Ja.
And I bet one of them is baby-sitting a sick friend.
Don't you know when to quit?
Let's go home.
That's for sure.
Something real phony is going on.
- That was a close one.
- Yeah.
Well, back to bowling.
Are you out of your mind?
Grab the bowling balls.
We gotta beat them home.
I was never so embarrassed in my life.
How could two sets of characters look so much alike?
All I can say is one set of characters better be home when we get there.
Step on it.
- This thing is the greatest.
- My invention, isn't it?
You know something, Rubble?
There'll be a Flintstone Flyer in every cave.
I'll be rich.
How about me?
Keep pumping.
We'll beat them home by an hour.
Faniculi, faniculi, fanicula - Hey, Fred, look.
- Look where?
- Double trouble at 6 o'clock.
- What do you know!
The wives.
Hey, they must be doing over 80.
They're gonna beat us home.
No, they're not.
Now hear this.
Pilot to co-pilot.
I read you, loud and clear.
Retract landing gear.
Introvert your decibels.
Increase speed to 4,500 rpms.
- Over and out.
- What's all that mean, Fred?
It means step on it, you imbecile, that's what.
Let's go.
Faniculi, fanicula.
What will we say when they ask why we're home so early?
- Just say we missed them.
- Why not tell them the truth?
And say we don't trust them around the corner?
- Suppose they're not here?
- They'll be back.
- What'll we do in the meantime?
- In the meantime, we get meaner.
Quiet.
Maybe Fred's asleep.
Read me another bedtime story, Barney-pal.
Sure.
Which one: Uncle Wigley or I was a Teenage Brontosaurus?
So help me, I'll never mistrust Fred again.
You're right, Wilma.
They're two of the good ones.
Let's face it.
We're a couple of shrews.
Ja, that's for sure.
Let that be a lesson.
Never doubt your husbands or they may take a powder.
Get it?
It was them.
You dope!
- State of shock?
- Wilma, no, not in the head!
- Try that on your fortissimo.
- Stand still, you insect.
Betty, not with the bowling ball.
- Head for the whirligig!
- Start flapping for a quick takeoff.
- Come back, you coward!
- Wilma, they're getting away.
Don't worry.
Whatever goes up sooner or later comes down.
Especially the fat ones.
- Your play.
- Gin.
How long would you say they've been up there?
About six hours, give or take a few.
But, Fred, my legs are getting tired.
Are your legs tired, or are you tired of living?
Keep pumping.
I'm too pooped to pump.
It won't be long now.
- Barney's running out of gas.
- I know.
It'll be nice to have them back.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
When the saints come marchin'in Oh, when the saints come marchin'in Yeah, I want to be in that number When the saints come marchin'in Gentlemen, I now declare this meeting of the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs adjourned.
Motion seconded.
- All in favor, say "aye".
- Aye!
- Good meeting tonight, Barney?
- Yeah, Fred.
We're all set for our annual benefit show next week.
Yeah.
There's one thing that bothers me, Barney.
- What's that, Fred?
- We're all supposed to do a solo act, right?
- Right.
- And every year I get up and sing, right?
If you wanna call it that.
This year I'd like to do something different.
Your singing is different, Fred.
Funny.
Very funny.
And what are you gonna do, funnyman?
- Crack jokes?
- No, but I'll think of something.
I don't get it.
A no-talent guy like you isn't worried, and I am.
I got something up my sleeve.
The only thing you got up your sleeve is your arm.
You're sore because I have an idea and you haven't.
Oh, yeah?
I'll figure out an act that's better than yours.
Could be, Fred, could be.
Good night.
"Could be, Fred, could be".
I don't know why I stay friends with that guy.
Come on, Fred.
You've been brooding about that show for two days now.
Why don't you just sing a song and let it go at that?
Yeah, maybe you're right.
Fellas will probably be disappointed if I don't.
After all, Wilma, you know I used to sing with a band - before I married you.
- Before I married you.
Yes, I know, Fred.
You've told me a thousand times that you sang with the Rockville Center high school band 20 years ago.
I can still hit the old high notes.
Listen.
Do-re- mi-fa-so-la-ti-do Fred, stop it!
Take that sea-lion voice of yours out of the house.
Out!
Women.
No musical appreciation at all.
- Hi, Fred.
What's new?
- Nothing new.
Same old trouble.
Wilma won't let me sing in the house.
You got a pretty loud voice, Fred.
Can't say I blame her.
Barney, what are you doing?
I'm practicing my trampoline act for the show.
How do you like it, Fred?
Say, that's all right.
- How about letting me try it?
- Hold it, Fred.
Don't jump off the fence.
No, no, wait!
Fred, you okay?
I'm getting back on that thing and master it.
Attaboy, Fred.
Now you got the hang of it.
These trampolines are all right.
Do me a favor, Barney.
- Let me borrow it for a while.
- Borrow it?
What for?
I'm supposed to meet Wilma at her dressmaker's shop.
It's up on the second floor, and just for a laugh I'd like to bounce in on her.
I'll bring it right back.
Okay, Fred.
But bring it right back.
Oh, boy.
Won't Wilma be surprised when she sees me in the window.
This is my latest creation, Wilma.
How do you like it?
- It's just gorgeous.
- It is genuine spotted leopard.
- Shall I have Zsa-Zsa model it for you?
- Yes.
Do you mind, Zsa-Zsa?
Not at all, madam.
It will only take me a minute to change and I will be right out.
There's a man at the window.
Call the police!
A man?
Lmpossible.
- But we are on the second floor.
- Just a minute.
I'll take a look.
Boy, how embarrassing.
I can't stop bouncing.
Just as I thought.
There's no man at the window.
It's just your imagination.
Hiya, Wilma.
Of all the dumb tricks you've ever pulled that trampoline business takes the cake.
I've never been so humiliated.
And when I had to explain that you were just trying to be funny I could have frozen to death from the cold stares I got.
Fred, are you listening to me?
Oh, that man.
Fred Flintstone, I'm talking to you.
What in the world are you doing?
And where did you get all that junk?
Junk?
"Junk," she says.
This junk, as you call it happens to belong to the world's greatest magician: Rockstone the Great.
- Does that ring a bell?
- No.
But if you don't get that junk out of the house, I'll wring your neck.
For your information, Mr. Rockstone loaned me this equipment and I am going to do a magic act for the annual show.
But you don't know anything about magic.
Oh, no?
Watch.
- You see this egg, Wilma?
- Of course I see it.
Okay, now you see it.
And now you don't.
Where is it, Wilma?
Right here, Fred.
Very droll.
Watch this, Wilma, the hand is quicker than the eye.
Fred, don't you dare pull that tablecloth.
That does it.
The hand is quicker than the eye?
- Now get that junk out of here.
- Okay, Wilma.
Come in.
- Hello, Fred.
Anything wrong?
- We heard a crash.
- What happened, Wilma?
- Nothing serious, Betty.
Come on in.
- What's Fred doing with the funny hat?
- Trying to be funny.
What's this thing, Fred?
That, Barney, is part of my magic act which, by special request I am not going to do.
- What's it supposed to be?
- That is a disappearing cabinet.
Anyone goes in there, I make them disappear.
- Like your disappearing egg?
- Okay, laugh.
I'll show you it'll work.
Get in the cabinet, Barney.
Who me?
I'm afraid of the dark.
- Show me, Fred.
I'll get in the cabinet.
- Me, too, just for laughs.
Okay, girls.
I'm gonna shut the door now.
You all set?
Go ahead, Fred.
We're ready.
Now, let's see.
What were those magic words again?
Look, Wilma.
There's another door in the back of the cabinet.
Let's go along with the gag, Betty.
We'll sneak out and hide in the bedroom.
And Fred will think he made us disappear.
Quiet.
I got it, Barney.
Alakazam!
Alakazoo!
You won't come back until I tell you to.
Now, we open the door.
Barney, look.
- They're gone.
- It worked.
- They disappeared.
- Gee, Fred, that's amazing.
- Now bring them back.
- Bring them back?
- Now, Barney, let's not be too hasty.
- What do you mean, Fred?
- They disappeared, right?
- Right.
They can't come out till I say the magic word, right?
Right.
That could give us an evening out, and they'd never know about it.
Right?
What will we do, Fred?
Go bowling, see a movie, the fights?
No, none of those things, Barney-boy.
I got a great idea.
Something different.
Yeah?
I'm listening.
We're gonna go to the Rockland Dance Hall.
The Rockland Dance Hall?
That is different.
Stand aside, Betty.
I'll rock him good.
No, Wilma.
Let them go.
I got a better idea.
There ought to be one of these little boxes in every home.
It could replace the dog as man's best friend.
Yeah, you said it, Fred.
Let's go, Barney-boy.
They're gone.
And what's a better idea than hospitalizing them?
We'll go down to the Rockland Dance Hall and catch them red-handed.
Okay, then we'll hospitalize them.
Look, we'll dress up in the costumes we made for the annual lodge ball so they won't recognize us.
- Say, this is gonna be fun.
- Right.
Meet you in 10 minutes.
I don't know why I'm going to the dance hall, Fred.
I can't dance.
Who said anything about dancing, Barney?
I wanna hear the band.
Hot Lips Hannigan is playing there.
Hot Lips Hannigan!
Oh, boy, I like him.
The sweetest music this side of Birdland.
You know something?
I used to sing with the old H.L. When he had the high school band.
- No kidding?
What happened?
- Wilma happened.
She objected to me being out all night.
Yeah, I guess some wives are like that.
- How do I look as a blonde, Wilma?
- Real beat, man.
- Like far-out.
- Let's get started.
- They must be almost there.
- Lead me to the scene, chick.
Listen to the joint jump, Fred.
Boy, old Hot Lips is sure in the groove tonight.
Attaboy, Hot Lips.
Encore!
Thanks, cats.
There'll be more, like, later.
Hot Lips, remember me?
Did some disciple, like address the leader?
Over here, H.L. It's me, Fred Flintstone.
Freddie, for goodness' sake!
How are you, boy?
Long time, no see.
Put on a little weight since you got out of high school, I see.
Yeah.
This is my friend, Barney Rubble.
He's one of us.
I hardly knew you in that get-up, H.L. You look so weird.
Isn't it awful what you have to do to stay in the band business today?
Everything's a gimmick.
But I can't quit.
Two kids in college, a new split-level house and these modern songs.
They don't make sense.
The old songs had heart.
They meant something.
- Yeah.
- Like, Three ltty-bitties Want Some Seafood, Mama, and Bie Mir Bis Du Schoen - with bubbles all over the place.
- Yeah.
And Red Hot Mamma, You Gotta Turn Your Damper Down Annie Doesn't Live Here Any More - Mamma Loves Papa - No, stop it, Freddie-boy.
- You're steaming up my glasses.
- Like you said, H. L they don't write songs like that anymore.
For old times' sake will you sing one of the old songs?
Shucks, H.L. - These kids wouldn't like that old stuff.
- Sing it for me, Fred.
A sort of musical sentimental journey for an old pal.
How about Number 42 from the old book?
That gets me right here, Fred.
Can Barney sit in, too?
He's pretty good on the drums.
Sure.
Shelly, let this cat use your skins for a number.
Right, man.
Hi, all you cats.
I've got a square from way back there who's gonna belt one out for us.
Freddie Flintstone the Golden Smog and on the skins, Barney Rubble to give us trouble.
Oh, boy.
Somebody must've left the gate open at the old folks' home.
Yeah, strictly from prehistoric.
Now the Golden Smog asks the musical question When the saints come marchin'in Oh, when the saints come marchin'in Yeah, I want to be in that number When the saints come marchin'in When the sun refuses to shine Oh, when the sun refuses to shine I want to be in that number When the sun refuses to shine That voice!
Sounds familiar, doesn't it, Betty?
Sounds more like a hog-calling contest.
Let's go inside.
I thought I recognized that frog voice, Betty.
That's Fred up there, groaning.
And look on the drums, it's Barney!
Yeah, man!
When the saints come marchin'in Oh, when the saints come marchin'in I want to be in that number When the saints come marchin'in When the saints come marchin'in When those saints come marchin'in - Those cats are pretty cool.
- Yeah, I dig it, man.
That voice!
And those saints go marchin'in When those saints go marchin'in I want to be in that number When those saints go marchin'in That drummer man!
Wilma, what's going on?
I don't know, Betty.
But the Golden Smog seems to be a hit with these kids.
When the saints come marchin'in Marchin'!
How about that, cats?
Come on, Betty.
We'd better latch on to our husbands, or we'll never get them back.
- Hurry, before those kids tear us apart.
- You're not kidding.
Let's get out of here.
Golden Smog, come in here, quick.
We'll save you.
Thanks, lady.
- You saved our lives.
- Think nothing of it, Big Daddy.
You're my type.
You're the most.
I dig that Golden Smog.
Man, like, can you beat those skins.
Skins?
Yeah.
We'll make, like, real music together, cat.
I don't know about that.
I'll have to ask Betty.
Betty, she's out of the scene.
She don't make it, like.
I mean, like, way-out.
But, madam, I Come on, Big Daddy.
Spread some of that Golden Smog on my ears.
Wait a minute, lady.
I got a wife.
I bet she doesn't understand you.
She understands me, but she wouldn't understand you!
Let's scram out of here.
Hot Lips!
You gotta help us.
There were two girls after us.
They won't leave us alone.
Okay, Fred, you beat it.
I'll sidetrack them.
It's crazy, but I'm an idol around here.
When Hot Lips talks to them, they forget everybody else.
- Wait for us, Big Daddy.
- Here they come.
Contact.
There's some contact for you, you old goat-face.
Every once in a while, a moment of truth.
Faster, Fred.
Faster!
That'll teach them a lesson.
Now, let's get back to the house before they get there.
- Boy, that was close.
- And how.
If Wilma and Betty ever found out about this, they'd have our scalps.
Barney-boy, stop your worrying.
I made them disappear, remember?
But after I bring them back, I'm returning all that magic stuff.
Good.
It's dangerous, real dangerous.
Now, let me see.
How does it work?
- Gosh, Fred, don't tell me you forgot?
- I got it.
Whether you're near or whether you're far come out, come out wherever you are.
Big Daddy-o, you forgot to take us with you.
Did you bring your skins, drummer boy?
Run, Barney, run!
They're in the closet.
Now, let's get out of these costumes, quick.
- Hear anything, Fred?
- Not a sound.
Take a peek.
See if they're gone.
The coast is clear, Barney.
We can come out now.
Wow, they must've got discouraged and gone home.
Wow, if our wives ever caught us with those What's the matter with you?
Lxnay, ixnay!
Caught you with who, Fred?
Come on, Fred, speak to me.
Who am I?
- You're Benny?
- No.
Billy?
It's you, Barney.
Wilma, Fred's coming out of it.
- Did Wilma and Betty see those two girls?
- No, they don't know a thing.
He'll be all right, Wilma.
Just let him rest for a while.
I will, Barney, and thanks.
- Good night, Wilma.
- Good night, Betty.
Wilma, I'm hungry.
How about fixing me up a little snack?
Fred, what are you doing up out of bed?
There's nothing wrong with me.
By the way, how did you like that disappearing trick, Wilma?
Pretty good?
The most, man.
Like way-out.
I mean I think I'll lie down again, Wilma and just skip the little snack.
I don't feel so good.
Not good at all.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Come on, Fred, make a wish then blow out the candles.
Yeah.
Quiet out there.
I gotta get some sleep.
Barney to the rescue.
Fred, you're home early.
Yep, I wanted to catch you before you started cooking.
Wait till you see what I brought home for dinner.
Fred, if you think I'm gonna stuff pheasant at this hour - It's not pheasant and I'll do the cooking.
- What did you buy?
A couple of dinosaur steaks, New York cut, two inches thick.
- They look a little stringy to me.
- Don't be a wise guy.
They're gone.
You must've left them at the butchers.
I tell you I had them when I came right home.
So how could I've - What's that?
- Barney, barbecuing next door.
How could those steaks disappear?
I swear I didn't stop anywhere.
What's he barbecuing?
- Smells like steak.
- Yeah.
And I didn't let this bag out of my sight for a sec Steak?
Did you say steak?
What a sneak!
I just put that bag down for a second.
Hi, neighbor.
How do you like these?
Couple of dinosaur steaks, two inches thick.
- Makes your mouth water, doesn't it?
- It does, does it?
Is he gonna get a fist full of fingers in that mouth.
- Okay, wise guy.
Hand them over.
- Hand what over?
- Hey, let go of those steaks.
- Okay, neighbor, you asked for it.
I found your steaks right here on the wall.
You owe Barney an apology.
Yeah, say you're sorry and let me have them.
I'm sorry and I'm gonna let you have both of them.
What's that for?
That's for the next thing you do wrong.
It's ridiculous, that's what it is.
Two grown men acting like a couple of kids.
They haven't spoken to each other for five days.
I'm sick and tired of it.
I told Barney to go right over and make up with Fred.
- What did he say?
- He absolutely refused.
So I said, "I'm going to invite my mother for a few weeks if you don't.
" Really?
What'd he say then?
Hi, Wilma.
I'll call you back, Barney is here now.
- Hello, Barney.
- I was just wondering if - How's everything, Wilma?
- Fine, Barney.
I'll go call him.
Fred, a friend of yours is here.
If his name's Barney, he's no friend of mine.
It's all right, Wilma.
But as long as I'm here I'd like the return of some property of mine which certain people borrowed but obviously don't intend to ever return.
- I'm referring to my ladder, if I may.
- Of course, Barney, help yourself.
If he's no friend of mine, I'm no friend of his.
You did that on purpose!
- So long, neighbor.
- Come back, you coward.
Betty, open the front door for a coward!
I'll head him off at the pass.
Help!
Fred, are you all right?
I will be as soon as I get out of this stupid hole and lay my hands on you.
That's not a stupid hole.
That's gonna be my swimming pool.
I don't care what it's gonna be.
I'm gonna sue you for - Swimming pool?
- That's right.
Oh, boy!
Swim parties, barbecues, water polo.
You know, the works.
Too bad we're not friends anymore, neighbor.
Maybe you're not my friend, neighbor, but I'm still yours.
- What do you mean?
- Just this.
I'm gonna show you how you can get your pool for nothing.
- I don't get it.
- Well, it's simple.
If you build half a pool and somebody gives you the other half free Yeah.
you're getting your half for nothing, right?
But who's giving me the other half free?
Who is your bosom buddy, close pal, and lifelong friend?
- How many guesses do I get?
- Barney, you're looking right at him.
See you around, bosom buddy, close pal, and lifelong friend.
Come back here.
- What's that supposed to be?
- A diagram of the finished pool.
This is how it works.
Here's your half, and here's my half that you get free with a diving board at either end.
You keep saying I get your half free, but it's in your yard.
Well, without my half you only got half a pool, right?
- Yeah, but - All right.
Now look at the advantages of owning a pool with somebody else.
You get all the expenses, the chlorine, the filters, the pool toys the cranophrane, the phonostein.
- The what?
- Cranophrane and the phonostein.
You gotta put it in every week, you know?
- Sure.
- And it all costs money.
We own the pool together, we share the cost.
- We do?
- And besides all that I'm throwing in this little surprise free.
- For me?
- For you, buddy.
You're one of the good ones, Fred.
I'm ashamed of myself.
Some friendships are written in blood, Barney-boy but this one is written in water.
- Water?
- Pool water, that is.
That's funny.
Start digging.
- I'm digging, Fred.
Look, I'm digging.
- All right.
You have to admit one thing they've been getting along real great since they started this pool deal.
Why not?
Barney is doing all the work.
Four thousand more buckets and the last one in is a hot potato.
Keep up the good work, Barney-boy.
You're almost there.
My half isn't even filled yet.
It's a big job, neighbor.
Okay, at this rate it's gonna take all day.
No, it's not.
Relax, Barney.
Because I'm gonna help you.
You are?
Yes.
I'm gonna get you a bigger bucket.
- How do I look?
- Tres chic, sir.
You might say around the world in 80 inches.
Yeah, it is tres chic, all right, even if I say so myself.
You think it's a little tight around the middle?
No.
Snug, perhaps, but tight, never.
You have a handsome physique, sir.
Yeah, I know.
Barney should have it filled by now.
Oh, boy, swim parties, barbecues - All through, Barney?
- Last bucket, Fred.
Last one in is a hot potato.
Wait for me!
Out goes the bad air In goes the good - We should have left them in for good.
- Don't give me any ideas.
Out goes the bad air Wilma, when are we going shopping?
As soon as I serve His Majesty's lunch.
He's dining at the pool today.
- Where's Barney?
- He's trying on his gear.
Gear?
He's gonna practice spearfishing in the pool.
Spearfishing?
I'll be right back.
I gotta go feed the fish.
- Where do you want it, Fred?
- Set it down where I can reach it.
And remember if you sink don't let my best dishes go down with the ship.
- Take me to your leader.
- Barney, it's you.
Did my spearfishing outfit scare you?
Out of my wits.
And don't scare Fred, or he'll lose his lunch and my dishes.
Hi, Fred.
- And what are you made up for?
- I'm gonna practice spearfishing.
You can't lose.
You'll spear them or they'll die laughing.
How does it work?
And don't point that thing at me.
- I'm sorry.
- It's loaded.
You're making it awful tough to be good neighbors.
No use wasting the lunch.
Hey, Charlie, how soon till quitting time?
Any minute now, Fred.
I can't wait to hit that pool.
And thar she blows.
Last one in is a Now what?
Hi, Fred.
Grab a shoehorn, and squeeze in.
"Squeeze in" where?
Neighbor, you and me have to have a little talk.
And who ordered this pool full of people?
They are not people.
It's the YCMA.
- I'm letting them use it.
- You mean the YMCA.
No,  Young Cavemen's Association.
Hey, buster, you're getting a little heavy.
Last week it was the Boy Scouts.
Monday, your relatives.
Tuesday, it was your club.
And last night, the bowling team.
"Last night, the bowling team".
When do I get to use my half of the pool?
You are forgetting, neighbor, that your half is my free half and I'm letting you use it.
You are an ungrateful ingrate.
And there is only one way to handle an ungrateful ingrate.
Is this any way to treat your bosom buddy close pal, and lifelong friend?
Barney, you're right.
This is no way to treat a bosom buddy, a close pal, a lifelong friend.
This is!
Now what?
We're only gone a couple of hours we come back and you got a spike fence up.
It's simpler this way.
When he wants to use his half he does.
And when I wanna use my half, I do.
And right now I intend to use my half with a fancy one-and-a-half.
- Hi, neighbor.
- Barney, what happened?
I took out my half of the water.
Why should I fill the pool for that hippopotamus next door?
Because the wife of that hippopotamus next door happens to be my best friend.
That's why.
The fence comes down because the wife of that little sawed-off runt happens to be my best friend.
And another thing.
This constant quibbling between the two of you has got to come to an end.
Not a bad idea.
- Where's Fred?
- He's inside taking a nap.
I haven't seen him since D-day.
You mean "D" for "Down-With-The-Fence"-day?
You know Fred, he's decided: "That pool isn't big enough for the two of us".
Barney and his buddies are sure using it.
You know big, kind-hearted Barney: "Sure, come over, use the pool".
"Big, kind-hearted Barney".
Don't forget.
Barney is having the bunch over tonight.
- I know.
- Does Fred know?
No.
But if he asks, I'll tell him Barney's having a pool-warming party.
"Pool-warming party"?
Sounds like the call of the male gripe-o-saurus.
- You bellowed?
- I did.
I understand "big, kind-hearted Barney" is having a pool-warming which includes using my half of the pool without my permission.
You get the message and I've got one for you.
I don't want any trouble.
You think I'd make trouble for my bosom buddy close friend, and lifelong pal?
- Is that what you're intimating?
- No, that's not what I'm intimating.
- That's what I'm saying.
- Wilma, I'm surprised at you.
Why would I make trouble for Barney just because he's been a little unneighborly?
Just because he's a little ungrateful?
Just because he's the biggest rat I ever met?
Don't be silly.
Hello.
Who?
- It's for you, Charlie.
- Tell them to hold it a minute, Mac.
Eight rock in the corner pocket.
He'll be right with you.
Ten rock the hard way.
Yeah?
Hello, Fred.
Do you a favor?
Yeah, listen.
I'm playing a gag on a neighbor.
Remember the outfit you wore at the Halloween party?
You mean the policeman's suit?
Yeah.
Bust in and give them the disturbing-the-peace routine?
Yeah, no more parties, or I'll throw the book at them.
No, they won't know you.
You put on that phony mustache and the big nose.
We'll have a load of laughs.
- What are you up to, Fred?
- Me?
What makes you say that?
I know you, Fred Flintstone.
Don't try anything funny.
I promise you, Wilma, if I try anything, it won't be funny.
Don't you realize Barney is really the best friend you've got?
And with him for a friend, I don't need any enemies.
See who's at the door.
I don't get it.
Why do you always have to stick up for that knee-high Gila monster?
For he's a jolly good neighbor Remember, this was Barney's idea.
For he's jolly good bosom buddy, lifelong friend, and pal Happy birthday, Freddie-boy!
My buddy!
Come on, Fred.
Make a wish, then blow out the candles.
Okay.
Let's see, I wish Quiet out there!
I gotta get some sleep.
Ever since that pool went in, nobody sleeps.
Okay, this is all-out war.
Yes, madam, we'll take care of it.
Yes, I know, sir.
We'll quiet it down.
I know you're a taxpayer.
I know.
Calling car 809.
Yes, Sarge?
Investigate riot at Fifth and Stone Canyon.
Right, Sarge.
Over and out.
Let's go, Pete.
Barney to the rescue!
Barney is having a ball.
Looks like this pool-warming party is coming to a boil.
All right, everybody, the party's over.
Let's quiet it down, folks or I'll have to book you on a 407, a 609 and a 33-and-a-third.
We got a dozen complaints.
Swell job, Charlie.
Let's ham it up a little.
So, the party's over, big mouth?
Big mouth?
How would you like to take a running 407-and-a-half into the pool?
All right, wise guy, I'm gonna run you in.
You mean I'm gonna run you in.
Into the pool, that is.
- Fred, have you flipped?
- Relax, Wilma.
That's no policeman, that's my friend Charlie.
- Fred.
- Yeah, Charlie?
- I couldn't get the policeman's suit.
- That's okay, Charlie.
Who's that in the pool?
It ain't Brigitte Bardot.
"Disturbing the peace, resisting arrest.
"Dunking an officer".
Et cetera, et cetera.
I didn't even have a piece of me own birthday cake.
How do I get into these messes?
Barney-boy, am I glad to see a human face.
How are you, Fred, old pal?
- I'm okay, I guess.
- Relax, Fred.
We'll have you out as soon as the judge sets bail.
- Thanks, old pal.
- And in the meantime: Happy birthday, bosom buddy, close friend and lifelong pal You're one of the good ones.
- Thanks for bailing me out, Barney.
- What are neighbors for?
Is Wilma still mad?
She'll get over it.
She gave me the bail money, didn't she?
Like you said, Fred, "This friendship is written in water.
- "Pool water, that is".
- Speaking of pool water You mean, "Last one in"?
Fred, I forgot to tell you.
I had to clean the pool, so I drained it.
Wilma!
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Oh, no.
And I made it double or nothing.
Oh, no.
Flintstone's a good winner but he's certainly a poor looser.
Here comes Fred home from work, Dino.
Come on, boy.
Come on, greet your daddy.
He's home.
No, Dino!
Hold it, boy!
Not now.
Stop it, Dino.
Stop it!
You hear that, Dino, stop it.
Hi, Fred.
Dino sure gave you the big welcome tonight.
What do you mean, "tonight"?
Dino gives me a big welcome every night.
Don't you, boy?
- Dinner ready, sweetheart?
- In a minute, Fred.
Go sit down.
You know, Wilma, I've been feeling wonderful this past week.
Must be because I haven't seen that ungrateful neighbor of ours, Barney Rubble.
- Ungrateful?
How come?
- I'll tell you how come.
I figured that Barney wasn't getting paid enough.
So last week I went to see his boss.
I told him I was Barney's agent.
And, boy, did I lay it on the line.
Laid what on the line, Fred?
I told him I was collective bargaining for Barney.
And unless Barney collected a lot of retroactive pay, the bargain was over.
Then I told Barney to put his broom down and go see his boss.
- And then what?
- I haven't seen that ingrate Barney since.
He's probably living it up on that big fat raise I got him.
Who cares?
To stop seeing him around is worth it.
It's water over the bridge.
Nothing could get me mad.
Not the way I feel.
Nothing.
What's the idea?
One smelt for dinner?
I thought nothing could get you mad, Fred.
One measly smelt is nothing.
And I'm mad.
I need nourishment.
I'm a growing man.
You're growing, all right.
You're growing impossible.
Oh, yeah?
What happened to the dinosaur steak I brought home last night?
If you must know, I gave it to Betty and Barney.
- Betty and Barney?
- That's right.
So it isn't enough I get the guy more dough.
He's got to sponge off my wife when my back is turned.
I'm gonna go see that sponge and squeeze his ungrateful head.
Fred, just a minute.
Get away from that door, Wilma.
My chivalry is getting thin.
And that's the only thing about you that is getting thin.
Now you listen to me, blabbermouth.
The reason I gave him the steak is because they haven't had a decent meal all week.
They're too proud to ask for help.
But the truth is they're flat broke.
Broke?
What's Barney doing with all that money I got him?
Are you kidding?
All you got him was a place in the unemployment line.
After you got through shooting off your big mouth to Barney's boss, he fired Barney.
I was only trying to help.
You better think of something that will help Barney or you'll be eating smelt all month.
Okay, Wilma, I'll think of something.
Me and my big mouth.
Who is it?
It's me, Barney.
Fred.
Come on in, Fred.
The door is open.
How about that guy?
He ain't even sore at me.
Hello, Fred.
How've you been?
You're looking well, Fred.
Hiya, Barney.
Betty.
- Long time no see.
- Yeah.
Why don't you boys go in the den?
I'll fix some snacks.
If I can find any.
Think nothing of it, Fred.
I know you meant well and besides, it wasn't much of a job anyway.
Thanks, Barney.
You're a swell guy.
But I lost you a job and I'm gonna get you another.
- Yeah?
How, Fred?
- I've got an influential friend - that could get you a job in a minute.
- No kidding?
It happens I'm playing golf with him tomorrow, and you're coming along.
But I don't play golf, Fred.
You don't have to.
We'll make it a threesome.
You can caddy, and that way he'll get to know you.
And I'll needle him into giving you a job.
That sounds good.
You think it'll work?
Barney, my boy, did I ever give you a bum steer?
- Well - Don't answer that, Barney.
Just meet me at the Gravel Beach Golf Course in the morning.
- This sure is a nice place, Fred.
- Oh, it'll do.
Now listen, Barney.
This guy, Mr. Boulder, whose bag you're gonna carry is my private golf pigeon.
In the business world, very big.
On the golf course, nothing.
We play every week.
$1 a hole and side bets.
- Can you afford it?
- Of course I can't.
But I never lose.
Now, be nice to him.
You suggest what clubs to use and stuff like that.
But, Fred, I don't know one club from another.
So much the better.
For me.
Mother, get the peanuts out, here comes my pigeon.
Hiya, Mr. Boulder.
Good morning, Flintstone.
Nice day for golf.
Mr. Boulder, I want you to meet a friend of mine.
This is Barney Rubble.
Good morning, Rubble.
And what's your handicap?
Offhand, I'd say my biggest handicap is living next door to Fred.
I like a man with a sense of humor.
Don't you, Flintstone?
Yeah.
Rubble.
Haven't we met before?
Southampton, Newport, Palm Beach?
Maybe the steam room at the Y?
The Gaiety Bowling Alley?
I'd better explain, Mr. Boulder.
Barney is going to caddy for you.
He needs the money.
Needs money?
I've heard of people like that, but I never thought I'd meet one.
There're a lot of us like that, Mr. Boulder.
I lead such a rich, sheltered life.
- Fore!
- What does "fore" mean, Fred?
Don't ever do that!
- Sore head.
- Quiet!
You got a good curve on it, Fred.
Wow, what a shot, Fred.
Right back on the tee where you started.
Here you are, Mr. Boulder.
This looks like a pretty good one.
A putter?
To drive with?
Okay, you're the caddy.
You know this game better than I do.
Driving with a putter, yet.
Boy, this is gonna be good.
A hole in one!
- Is that good, Fred?
- You're a whiz, Rubble.
That's the first hole in one I ever shot.
And I did it with a putter, thanks to you.
It looks like I'm winning a friend, Fred.
You could still end up even.
You're losing me.
Did you keep your eye on the ball, Fred?
Does that answer your stupid question?
Rubble, what'll I do now?
My ball's down here in this sand trap.
Down in a sand trap.
Let's see.
Try this, Mr. Boulder.
A driver?
A driver in a sand trap.
You wanna make it double or nothing, Mr. Boulder?
Okay, it's a bet.
Oh, no.
And I made it double or nothing.
Oh, no.
Flintstone's a good winner, but he's certainly a poor loser.
Like you always say, Flintstone: "It's not winning the game that counts, it's collecting the dough".
- Fred, the job.
- Yeah, the job.
Mr. Boulder, could you somehow get Barney a job?
Anything at all.
He's not too You know.
For Barney, anything.
Tell you what, Barney.
You go see this friend of mine, Rocky Stone.
Now, here's my card.
The address is on the back.
And tell him I sent you.
- Gee, thanks, Mr. Boulder.
- Edgar, to you, Barney.
So long, loser.
I'll see you next week.
Yeah.
So long, Mr. Boulder.
Ta-ta, Edgar.
A hole in one.
Double or nothing.
Boy, I was really in the groove today.
He deserves to win at least once.
Only it sure puts me in a mess of sour pickles.
What do you mean, Fred?
The dough I lost was supposed to make the delinquent payment on the TV set.
I don't dare tell Wilma.
Fred, I'm gonna go see about that job right away.
- And thanks a lot for helping me.
- Yeah.
Good luck, Barney.
"Rocky Stone Inc." Yep.
This is the place.
Come in.
- Mr. Stone?
- Yes.
What's your complaint, buster?
No complaint, sir.
Mr. Boulder sent me down for a job.
Mr. Boulder.
Come right in.
So you're a friend of Mr. Boulder?
He's a great man.
Very big in the business world.
But I hear he's not so hot with the golf club.
Yes, sir.
He said that you would give me a job.
And he is right, sir.
You've got a job.
I have?
Gee, thanks, Mr. Stone.
What'll I do?
Now, first let me explain something.
A lot of people think our business is cruel.
But they're wrong.
You see that picture hanging on the wall?
Throwing people to the hungry lions.
Now, that's cruel, sir.
You keep that picture in mind while you're doing your job.
- What is my job?
- Look at the picture.
I am.
You're going to repossess furniture.
- Repossess furniture?
- Someone's got to do it.
Think of all the cheats who won't pay what they owe.
Think of how they laughed when we trusted them.
- How we took their word in good faith.
- Yeah.
- They can't get away with it.
- Right!
And here's your first assignment.
A real tough one.
Refuses to pay up on his TV set.
- Why, the welsher.
- You're right.
- Get the money or bring back the set.
- Right.
Now, raise your right hand and read the oath.
"Neither rain nor snow, nor threats of tears "shall deter this collector "from the completion of his contemptible duty".
It kind of gets you right here, doesn't it?
- Kind of gets me right here.
- Okay, now TV or not TV.
That's a gag we have in the trade.
I'll start small.
A TV set first.
And I'll work my way up to pianos, bedroom sets, houses.
Who knows?
Now, let's see where that deadbeat lives who won't pay up on his TV set.
Fred?
Oh, no.
And he helped me get this job.
What will I do?
I just can't go in and take my best friend's TV.
And yet, I need this job.
Besides, I took the oath.
I pledged allegiance to the hungry lions.
I just can't fail on my first assignment.
Maybe Fred can pay.
He always has some dough stashed away for sweepstake tickets or something.
They went thataway.
- Which-a-way?
- Thataway.
Hi, Fred.
Hello, Barney.
Come on in.
Pull up a chair.
Want to try some of this Sabertooth Tiger milk?
No, thanks, Fred.
Guy on TV recommends it for fallen arches.
I'm not sure if you're supposed to drink it or soak your feet in it.
You sure like your TV set, don't you, Fred?
You bet.
I'd rather lose my right arm than miss my TV programs.
I was afraid of that.
Look, here comes the fellow with the stiff leg that helps the sheriff out.
Speaking of sheriffs, did you make that delinquent payment on the TV set yet?
Are you kidding?
I lost that money to Mr. Boulder, trying to help you get a job.
Yeah, I know, Fred, and I appreciate it.
But you must have a few bucks stashed away in your bowling ball bag?
Quiet, you fathead.
Want Wilma to hear you?
Knock it off about my financial rating.
Don't you have any money, Fred?
What is this?
Am I on the witness stand?
Who do you think you are?
Perry Gunite or something?
I'm broke.
B-R-O-K, broke.
Now shut up about me.
Let's talk about you.
Did you get the job Mr. Boulder sent you to see about?
Yeah, I got it.
You don't seem too happy about it.
I'm not.
I'm quitting.
Quitting?
No, you're not.
You want me to get in bad with Mr. Boulder?
What's the matter with the job?
I don't know.
It goes against my grain.
Look who's got a grain.
You see this?
How would you like those knuckles to rub up against the grain of your wooden head?
- Fred.
- Fred, nothing.
What could be wrong with a job you had for an hour?
I would have to do something ruthless.
So what?
In business you've got to be ruthless.
You've got to use every trick in the book.
When fighting fair don't work, fight dirty.
But how about friendship, Fred?
Friendship?
Your only friend is a buck.
And the more bucks you got, the more friends you got.
You are a soldier in the business army now.
Your boss is your commander.
When he says "charge," you charge!
Trample the enemy or be trampled!
You do whatever your job calls for.
- That's your duty.
- Yes, sir.
And thanks for the advice, Fred.
For a guy that digs ditches, you sure know the business world.
Just a minute, Barney.
Let me open the door for you.
Thanks, Fred.
Thanks for everything.
That Barney is like putty in my hands.
Now, let's see.
There's a fight on Channel 15.
Barney!
Barney, are you nuts?
Where are you going with my TV set?
I'm repossessing it, Fred.
That's my new job.
Your job?
Taking my TV set?
Yeah, Fred.
You told me to be ruthless, remember?
Ruthless?
You bring this set back or you'll be toothless.
Fred, what are you and Barney doing with our TV set?
Nothing, Wilma.
We're airing out the aerial, like.
Put it back.
I want no fooling around with that set now that it's paid for.
Paid for.
Okay, Wilma.
We got it back.
And as for you, out of my house, you Benedict Whosis.
But, Fred, I'm in the business army now.
Okay, soldier, retreat!
Or they'll be blowing taps for you.
Business army?
Since an army travels on its stomach, a nice sandwich would be in order.
And I'll try some more of that Sabertooth Tiger milk, too.
Here's my chance.
Here comes Fred.
I'd better hide or he'll skin me alive.
How did that get here?
I could've sworn I put it on the stand.
Nope, I didn't.
Barney's got me so upset, I can't remember what I'm doing.
Nothing wrong with my muscles, though.
This set feels light as a feather.
Now it's back where it should be.
I hope it's working after all that hassling around.
Do you have trouble sleeping at night?
It may be because you're a deadbeat.
Pay up those annoying TV bills with one big payment and get a good night's sleep.
All right, wise guy, get out of my set!
I've got to take it back, Fred.
Okay, Barney.
I'll get you out the hard way even if I have to wreck this set.
It's my duty, Fred.
So long.
Come back here, Barney!
Kid, did you see a TV set run past here?
- A TV set running?
- Never mind, kid.
I see it.
The more I see of grown-ups, the more I want to stay being a little kid.
Come back here, you double-crosser.
Give me back my set!
Come on, Barney.
Where are you hiding?
- Any particular model you're looking for?
- Yeah, one with human legs.
What a business.
I try to keep a big stock.
The customers always want something else.
There you are!
Wait till I get my hands on you.
What do you know?
I had one.
I've got a bigger stock than I thought.
Listen to reason, Fred.
Got you!
Now get out of that set!
I've got a good mind to smack you on the schnozzola.
Fred!
What are you doing downtown with our TV set?
That is, you see Shucks.
Tell her the whole story, Barney.
- You mean the truth?
- Yeah, I give up.
Go ahead, Barney.
I'm listening.
- And that's the whole story, Wilma.
- Aren't you ashamed, Fred?
Taking it out on Barney when it's all your fault.
Take the set back, Barney.
It's your job.
- And no hard feelings.
- Thanks, Wilma.
- No hard feelings, Fred?
- Yeah.
And as for you, playboy golfer you are coming with me so I can keep an eye on you.
I still say that Barney is a false friend.
It's like that old proverb: "He who steals my TV, steals all".
Wilma.
My TV.
It's back.
It came home.
It's home.
- Here's a note for you, Fred.
- What's it say?
"Dear Fred, I got an advance on my first week's salary "and paid your TV bill.
"Don't worry about returning the money.
"I just don't want to lose your friendship".
Signed, Barney.
And that's your false friend, Fred.
That crazy guy.
- Hiya, Fred.
- Barney.
Hiya, pal.
- No hard feelings, Fred?
- Of course not, Barney.
Come on in.
I'll fix you some Sabertooth Tiger milk.
Yeah, come on in, pal.
Fred, you understand I was just doing my job?
I know, Barney, sure.
And I apologize.
I'm sure glad you feel that way, Fred.
Because when I went back to the office, they gave me another memo on you.
Something about an overdue payment on your golf clubs.
It sure is nice to see the boys making up.
Out!
And don't ever come back!
Be reasonable, Fred.
I've got to take them back.
Touch one golf club in my bag and I'll mash your head in with a mashie.
Come on, Fred.
It's my job.
You told me to be ruthless.
They were friends for about five minutes.
And that's about par for the course.
Wilma!
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Some poor mastodon is caught in the tar pit.
They ought to put a fence around the tar pit.
That's not a mastodon.
It's Fred singing.
They ought to put a fence around him.
Let's see now, the tralafast is connected to the doohickey the doohickey is connected to the franaspan the franaspan's connected to the thingamajig.
The thingamajig's connected to the whozit, and the whozit That's it.
The whozit isn't connected.
Betty!
Come to the window a minute.
- What is it, Barney?
- I'm going over to see if Fred's home.
- I got to borrow a whozit wrench.
- Okay, Barney.
Say hello to Wilma for me.
I don't know what we housewives would do without a good waste disposal.
- Anybody home?
- Just a minute, Barney.
I'll be right there.
Hiya, Wilma.
Betty says to say hello.
So I'm saying hello.
You say hello to her for me.
- Is Fred home yet?
- Not yet, Barney.
He must be caught in a traffic jam.
What do you want him for?
I wanted to borrow a whozit wrench from him.
But it can wait, Wilma.
A tall, frosty Cactus Coola.
I'll come back later.
Okay, Barney.
I'll tell him to call you when he gets home.
Right.
And by the way, thanks for the hospitality, Wilma.
You're welcome, Barney.
That Barney is so polite.
Such good manners.
I wish Fred would learn to be more like him.
Fred's a diamond in the rough but even diamonds can stand polishing.
I'd love it if he'd come through that door every night calm, urbane, with a smile on his lips.
Hello, Fred.
I see you finally got home.
- Did you have a tough day, dear?
- Yeah.
And it was so hot.
I bet it was terrible on the job.
And the traffic must've been awful.
A diamond in the rough, and they don't come any rougher.
What a day.
But in all that heavy traffic coming home one thing kept me going.
As the car reached the lawn, I could see it.
There it was, right in front of me, big as life.
What was it, Fred?
That frosty, cold bottle of Cactus Coola I put in the icebox last night.
Fred, you're so overheated, you shouldn't drink anything cold.
Suck a lemon.
That'll quench your thirst.
Suck a lemon?
Are you out of your mind?
All the way home I kept thinking of that tall cold, frosty cactus juice trickling down my hot throat.
Suck a lemon.
I got to hand it to you, Wilma.
You got a great sense of humor.
I'm sorry I came home so grouchy.
But it won't happen again.
I am turning over a new leaf.
No more yelling.
No more acting mean.
Wilma!
Where is it?
Where is what, Fred?
My last bottle of cold Cactus Coola.
- Did you drink it, Wilma?
Did you?
- No, Fred, I didn't.
Barney took it.
Barney took it?
- Yes.
He's your friend, isn't he?
- Friend?
No friend would take a man's last cold bottle on a hot day.
That does it.
This is it!
It's been coming on a long time, but this did it!
I am through with that Barney Rubble.
I disown him as a neighbor.
- Aw, Fred.
- Don't "Aw, Fred" me.
I'm never gonna speak to that guy again.
And I'm going over to his house right now and tell him.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.
Not too big a piece, Fred.
You haven't any to spare.
Haven't any to spare.
How droll.
How very droll.
The doohickey's connected to the franaspan.
Hello, Fred.
What happened?
Did you get caught in traffic?
- What's the matter, Fred?
- Barney, you and I are through.
Don't ever speak to me again.
We are finished.
I'm returning your lawnmower, your rake, your hedge shears, and your hose!
- My power tools, too?
- Yes, your power tools, too.
Gee, this is serious.
You never returned my power tools before.
There it is.
My Cactus Coola.
You didn't get to it yet?
And you won't either, 'cause I'm gonna drink it myself.
No, Fred.
No, wait, Fred.
There, icebox raider.
It's empty.
How do you like that?
Fred, may I ask one question?
Okay, but you better make it a good one 'cause it's the last time I'm talking to you.
Go ahead, ask.
Okay, Fred.
Why did you drink my car polish?
Car polish?
Car polish!
I'm poisoned.
- Do something, Barney!
- I'll get a chamois.
- Don't just stand there, do something!
- Like what, Fred?
Like get a pump.
Call a doctor.
Get a mechanic.
How should I know?
But do something.
Fred, you all right?
Betty.
Come out here, quick.
- I can't, I'm in the shower.
- Turn it off.
It's an emergency.
All right.
Hold it, Trixie.
It never fails.
Soon as I get in the shower that man wants something.
What happened to Fred?
I know it sounds stupid but Fred hit himself on the head with a bottle.
He knocked himself cold.
Oh, dear.
I'd hate to tell that story to Wilma.
What do you mean, Betty?
I mean, think how embarrassed Fred would feel if Wilma found out.
Maybe we can sneak him into his house and put him on his sofa - and she'll think he's asleep.
- Sneak him into the house?
Well, that's like sneaking an elephant into a telephone booth.
Anyway, let's give it a try.
Easy, Barney, easy.
Let's stop a minute while I catch my breath.
- Let's lean him up against the door.
- Okay.
Oh, boy!
He's a load to lug around.
Hiya, Wilma.
So, what else is new?
We brought Fred home.
- What happened?
- It could happen to anyone.
Yeah, Fred hit himself on the head with a bottle.
Hit himself on the head with a bottle?
Get him into bed, Barney.
I'll call a doctor.
Gee, Fred's been out a long time.
I wish the doctor would get here.
When I called, he said he'd be right over.
That's him now.
Come in, Doctor.
Have no fear, medical science is here.
I'm just in time.
My, you don't look good at all, not at all.
See, now what did I tell you?
Loosen your shirt, we may have to tap.
- Is it serious, Doc?
- Don't worry about it, son.
I never lost a patient yet.
Some don't get better, but I always know where they are.
That's a joke we use down at the clinic.
- Doctor.
- Yes?
That's not the patient.
Oh, my.
That's too bad.
You could use some help.
But let's get on with it.
All right, madam - stick out your tongue.
- Are you kidding?
I'm not sick.
We doctors are so busy.
Seems everybody is sick.
There you are, my dear.
- Where does it hurt?
- I'm not sick either.
I must insist upon quiet.
- This man is trying to get some rest.
- That's the patient!
That's the I'm not a mind reader, you know.
I can't diagnose when you don't tell the doctor everything.
He got hit on the head with a bottle.
A bottle?
You shouldn't hit him with a bottle.
A rolling pin, yes, maybe, but not a bottle.
- Can you hear me, Doctor?
- Yes, very clearly.
- Yes, indeed.
- Okay Now hear this.
Get lost!
I always wanted to have a human patient just once.
But that's it.
So it's back to my horses for me.
- Back to the pasture.
- Why, he's a veterinarian.
I must've gotten the wrong list of doctors.
I don't know.
Fred eats like a horse.
He's coming out of it.
Fred, wake up.
You feeling better?
Speak to me.
- Still out.
- I think I can snap him out of it.
- How, Wilma?
- Watch.
Fred, you want a hamburger?
- That did it.
- Boy, did you see that?
It's a good thing you didn't say pizza pie.
He would've gone through the ceiling.
Are you feeling okay, Freddie-boy?
Certainly, Bernard, my esteemed neighbor.
Bernard?
Are you all right, Freddie?
Bernard, please, not Freddie.
It's undignified.
My name is Frederick.
I'm sure you won't mind addressing me properly.
- What's wrong with him, Wilma?
- I don't know.
But he'll snap out of it in a minute.
There's my sweet, adorable wife Iooking charming as usual.
- How are you, my dear?
- See?
He's all right.
He knows me.
Are you kidding?
And there's Elizabeth, Bernard's wife a vision of loveliness a delight to the eye.
Yeah, he's all right.
He knows me, too.
If you ask me, Fred's flipped his lid.
Let's go home, Betty.
A good night's sleep will straighten him out.
Okay.
Good night, Wilma.
Toodle-oo, Frederick, you old dear.
I'm telling you, that sock on the noggin knocked a screw loose in Fred's head.
Why, Barney?
Because he called me a vision of loveliness?
What's your opinion, Barney?
That's sissy talk.
Regular guys don't talk like that.
Never mind regular guys, what's your opinion?
Tell me what you think of me, Barney.
- Betty, please.
- Say it, Barney.
All right.
You are a vision of loveliness.
Allow me, Wilma.
You're going to spoil me.
You've been so attentive the last few weeks.
Nothing will ever spoil my little turtledove.
You just rest, my dear.
Why don't you make a list of things to augment your scanty wardrobe whilst I finish doing the dishes?
Thanks, Frederick.
You're a dear.
I could use some new dresses and a fur coat.
Good evening, friends.
This is your Mystery Hour brought to you by Barney!
What's the matter with you?
Is this any way to leave the towel?
You just wet your hands and wiped the dirt off on it.
Why can't you be neat and clean like Frederick and hang up your things?
All I do is pick up after you.
Why, I even found one of your ties with soup spots on it stuffed in the flower vase.
Frederick wouldn't do a thing like that.
Why can't you be more like him?
Frederick, I hate Frederick!
Now, don't say so unless you mean it.
Do you really like it, Frederick?
I think it's superb, my dear.
Very chic.
But, Frederick, it's so expensive.
We'll be paying on it for years.
Details, my dear, mere details.
I shall walk to work, skip lunches make my old clothes do for another five years and before you know it, it shall be yours.
I wonder Is it possible for a man to be too nice?
Fellows, it's early.
Aren't you gonna shoot another game?
Gosh, Barney, I can't.
I got to go home and straighten up my closet.
Yeah, and this is my night to polish the silverware.
But, fellows, we always play on Tuesday nights.
What's the idea?
It's our wives' idea.
There's some joker around the neighborhood making it tough for us.
Some guy named Frederick.
That reminds me.
This is the night I vacuum the house.
And what would your pleasure be tonight, my dear?
Getting dressed up, going out to dance and hoop it up a bit with other people, and come home on the milk truck.
You're joking, my dear.
- That wouldn't be elevating.
- No?
Lt'd give me a lift, buster.
I know you can't be serious.
How about a spelling bee?
How about soaking your head?
Then how about reading Shelley's sonnets to you again?
I've heard Ode to a Lark so many times I could build a nest and lay eggs.
Then we'll have a little opera music.
Oh, no.
Wait till you hear this one, my dear.
It's different.
- And what's different about it?
- This one has just the music which allows me to sing the aria.
How about that?
Oh, no, I hate this one.
The pizzicatos are too andante.
True.
But the tonal counterpoint is so pianissimo.
Oh, brother.
I hate opera.
The orchestra is definitely out of tune.
Shall we try it again?
Once more and I'll blow my top.
Some poor mastodon is caught in the tar pit.
Yeah, they get caught in the tar, and they gradually sink.
They ought to put a fence around the tar pit.
That's not a mastodon.
It's Fred singing.
They ought to put a fence around him.
Poor Wilma.
Looks like we're in for a siege of opera this week.
I bet she'd settle for the spelling bees.
At least they don't hurt your ears.
Opera or spelling bees, either way, we get stung.
I say, you are in a pensive mood tonight, my dear.
What are you doing?
Just looking at some old photos of you, Frederick.
How quaint.
That's the old, crude me.
Yes, it is.
That's you at the Rubbles' New Year's party.
You put on Mrs. Stonehead's hat.
You were a riot.
Remember?
I'd rather forget.
And here's you when you won that pie eating contest.
Disgusting.
That was my uncouth period.
How did you ever stand me, Wilma?
It wasn't too hard.
It was kind of fun.
You can't go bowling and not ask Fred.
I mean Frederick.
I can give it a good, hard try.
All right, you've tried.
Now go over and ask him.
Okay.
Bowling?
I say, that sounds simply monotonous.
I just thought I'd ask.
After all, you are the team captain.
Yes.
Well, a captain should never let his followers down.
Lead on, old boy.
I shall respond to your plea.
Big deal.
Fellows, look who's here.
It's good old Fred.
Where you been, pal?
- Hiya, Fred.
- Yeah, long time no see.
Come on, Captain, it's your turn to bowl.
Please, you are wrinkling my fur.
Guys.
Did you get that?
"You are wrinkling my fur".
Good old Fred.
There's no one like him.
- They can say that again.
- Gentlemen, please.
I only came because I'm the captain.
And I want it strictly understood that I shall stand for no insubordination.
No insubordination.
What a guy!
Okay, Captain.
Get up there and make a strike.
This is a real pro in action.
It went into the gutter.
What happened, Fred?
Never mind that Fred stuff.
My name is Frederick.
They've been looking for Frederick.
I'd better get him out of here.
But I'm their captain!
This is mutiny.
And if they catch us, it'll be worse than that.
Come on, maybe we can beat them home.
Now stay there and don't move till I tell you to come out.
Barney, what's going on?
Why have you got Frederick under the bed?
Because I'm saving his life, that's why.
Now remember, don't come out from under there.
I'm telling you, Wilma, every guy in town is out to get him.
They even formed a Get-rid-of-Frederick-or-else club.
- Poor Fred.
We got to do something.
- But what?
Maybe we can sell the house and move out of town.
A rap on the head changed him maybe another crack on the noggin will change him back.
At this point, I'll try anything.
- Go ahead, Barney, conk him.
- Who me?
No, not me.
- I couldn't hit him.
- You hit him, Betty.
I can't even spank our dog.
I can't do it either.
- What'll we do?
- Say, I got an idea.
We can arrange it so he conks himself.
- How, Barney?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Now, you see that rock up there?
Yes, but why is it on top of the door?
Watch.
Get it?
When Fred opens the door The rock lands right on his noggin.
I suppose it has to be done but is it necessary to use such a hard rock?
Frederick has a hard head, you know.
Okay, go ahead.
But I can't watch.
- Frederick.
- Yes, Bernard?
Will you come out here and play some opera records for us?
Play some opera records?
Why, certainly, Bernard.
I'm glad your plebeian tastes are getting elevated.
I think I shall start with a sextet from Lucia.
Okay, okay!
Who's the wise guy?
I thought I told you we were through, Rubble.
And what's this stuff, Wilma?
Back, send it back!
You think I'm made of money?
Barney, aren't we supposed to go bowling tonight?
What are we waiting for?
The fellows need me.
I'm the captain of the team, you know.
Right, Fred.
Let's go.
There he goes with all his faults.
- He's still my Fred.
- And that's my Barney.
And we're stuck with both of them.
But we like it.
We like it.
Wilma!
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Wilma, it's me, Fred.
Wake up, Wilma.
There's nothing to be scared about.
Excuse me, Wilma, I didn't know you had company.
I'll be back later.
Get your hands off her, you monster!
Get out!
Wilma, help!
Hold it, Betty.
That's Fred's voice.
It is Fred.
It's a great script, Mr. Sandstone.
We're ready to shoot our new low-budget, one-day quickie horror movie.
Yes.
And what a title: And what a plot: The monster comes from the tar pits and falls in love with a beautiful girl.
In a month, everybody will steal it.
Good.
Who's in it?
Gary Granite, Rock Pile, and a new girl.
- What's her name?
- Wednesday Tuesday.
Or is it Tuesday Wednesday?
I can't remember.
Okay, get it rolling.
If it's not better than your last picture, turn in your sports car.
- One thing, Mr. Sandstone.
- Yes, what is it?
- May I call you Sandy?
- No.
Very well, Mr. Sandstone.
One more little thing.
- We'll have to build a town set.
- Build a town set?
- Why, our budget won't stand for that.
- What'll we do?
We need a town.
Use a real town.
That way, we get the buildings for free and we can use the townspeople as extras.
You know, they eat that stuff up, anyway.
Say, that is great.
That is large thinking, sir.
- Very, very large.
- Thank you.
It's nothing, nothing at all.
- But what town, sir?
- What town?
Why, that's easy.
Now, there's the whole flat world as we know it.
We'll pick out a town.
Let's see.
We'll take this one.
Which one is it?
It says "Bedrock".
That's a town?
It sounds so basic, solid, down-to-earth.
All right, now get going, my boy.
And bring me back a picture.
Yes, sir.
One quickie, low-budget picture made in Bedrock coming up.
Wash day.
If there's anything I hate more than anything else in the whole world it's doing the laundry.
She hates doing the laundry?
She.
We interrupt this program to bring you a flash from Hollyrock.
Miracle Pictures is going to use our town of Bedrock for the locale of their next picture.
And get this.
: Auditions are going to be held and some of our very own citizens may be used in the picture which will star Gary Granite!
Appearing with him will be Rock Pile and that new, exciting starlet Wednesday Tuesday.
Or is it Tuesday Wednesday?
Oh, my, oh, me.
Betty, quick!
I heard it, Wilma.
Imagine, Gary Granite, right here in Bedrock.
And Rock Pile, too.
And what's her name, Thursday Friday.
- You mean Wednesday Tuesday.
- Yeah.
She's so cute.
And they're going to use the people of Bedrock as extras.
Why don't we go down and audition, just for fun?
We'll call ourselves the no-talent sisters.
At least you can do swell bird calls.
And you can wow them with that soft-shoe bit you do every New Year's Eve.
- Is it a deal?
- Okay.
- I'll ask Barney when he comes home.
- And I'll ask Fred.
I know what he's going to say: "No"!
But I don't care.
Can you imagine?
- Here we are, Fred.
- Thanks, Barney-boy.
I'll see you after dinner.
After a tough day like today, I am ready for my nourishment.
Me, too.
I hope Betty has dinner ready.
I'm coming up the walk, Wilma.
Start putting the food on the plate.
I'm coming through the door.
And I'm one of the hungry ones tonight.
Wilma, where's my dinner?
Hey, Wilma.
It's me, Fred.
- Hello, Fred.
- Boy, did you have me worried.
I thought for a minute I'd have to fix my own dinner.
How can you even think of food at a time like this when they're going to make a picture right here in town.
- Make a picture?
- Yes.
And get this: With Gary Granite!
Gary Granite.
Who's he?
He is a big movie star.
And if you didn't happen to spend all your spare time in a bowling alley you'd know who he is.
Oh, yeah?
Well, I happen to know who you are.
You are my wife and you are supposed to have dinner ready for me when I get home Gary Granite or no Gary Granite.
What has Gary Granite got that I haven't got?
I can tell you what.
His dinner, that's what.
Droll, very droll.
I'm surprised at you, Wilma, falling for all that mushy stuff.
The trouble with you, Fred, is that you have no romance in your soul.
You're wrong there, Wilma, wrong again.
I'll tell you my trouble.
I've got no food in my stomach.
And I'm going out to get some while you look through your movie magazines.
If I run into Gary Cobblestone, or whatever his name is I'll give him your regards.
Oh, that Fred.
He didn't even give me a chance to ask him about the audition.
You mean they're gonna make a movie here in Bedrock?
That's right.
Isn't that thrilling?
And they're gonna use the people here for extras?
Wilma and I thought we'd go down to the audition.
If it's okay with you and Fred, that is.
It's okay with me, Betty.
Thanks, Barney.
You're the sweetest.
Keep saying it.
I like it.
I'll call Wilma and tell her I can make it.
- Hey, Barney.
- Hello, Fred.
- Did you hear the big news?
- Yeah, I heard it.
I'm on my way down to Rocky's Cafe to get a bite to eat.
- Do you want to join me?
- Sure.
Betty was so excited, she forgot to make dinner.
And then Fred stomped out of the house before I even had a chance to ask him.
Gee, that's a shame.
Barney said it was okay for me to try.
I didn't get a chance to ask Fred, so he didn't get a chance to say no so I'll take a chance and go with you tomorrow.
Delicious.
Give me brontosaurus ribs every time, Barney I could eat a carload of them.
Me, I'll take a pterodactyl drumstick every time, Fred.
Love these drumsticks.
How about shooting a game of billiards before we go home, Barney-boy?
Lead on, Freddie-boy, lead on.
I'm with you.
You know something, Barney?
I just can't understand some people.
Just because some movie company is arriving tomorrow they get all excited.
Movie being made here.
Big deal.
Ridiculous, isn't it, the way people act?
I don't know, Fred.
A lot of people will get a bang out of it.
A lot of people, maybe, but not the sophisticated types like us.
The plane with the movie crowd arrives at 6:00 tomorrow morning.
- You say 6:00?
- I'll bet the place will be mobbed with Sure, with a lot of numbskulls.
6:00, huh?
Boy, not even the birds are up yet.
Fred, I just remembered something.
I'm kind of tired.
I ought to get to bed early.
- Do you mind if we go home now?
- Not at all, Barney.
Kind of feel like hitting the sack myself.
I'm kind of beat.
Attention.
Special movie flight now arriving at Gate Stanley, what gate did you say?
Gate Four.
Arriving at Gate Four.
No autographs, please.
Here they come!
Here comes Wednesday Tuesday.
Tuesday Wednesday, what're you doing Saturday?
- Fred, what're you doing down here?
- Oh, boy.
I just came to see how many numbskulls would show up.
It looks like one more numbskull showed up than I expected.
There's Betty and Wilma.
That Rock, he is a doll.
- Let's beat it before they see us.
- Yeah, we're supposed to be working.
- Wasn't that exciting, Betty?
- I'll say.
- You know what I did?
- What?
I touched Rock Pile when he went by.
You did?
I'm not going to wash this hand for a week.
That'll be something to tell your grandchildren.
Let's go down and audition before all the jobs are gone.
All they can do is throw us out.
There they go.
Come on, Barney, I'll drive you to work.
- Fred, I've got an idea.
- Like what?
Let's take the day off and go down and watch the auditions.
You're the last guy I ever thought would go for that celebrity stuff.
I've got to face it, Fred.
I get a kick out of it.
Don't you get it, Barney?
It's just a publicity gag and people fall for it.
Look at all the people lined up at the casting door.
See what I mean.
Numbskulls.
Makes me want to turn in my running pants and get out of the human race.
Come on in, Fred.
We can watch the human race make numbskulls out of themselves.
Nothing doing.
I'm going to work, and I'm late now.
All right.
First harmonica picture we make, we'll send for you.
- I play the kazoo, too.
- That's fine.
First kazoo picture we make, you're in.
You don't expect to find any talent in this crowd, do you?
It creates goodwill, Gary.
And who knows?
No one ever heard of you till you won that cotton-picking chicken-plucking contest upstate.
All right.
Next.
Too bad, but hula hoops have had it.
Okay, that's it.
The first hoop picture we make, we'll call you.
You're next, Betty.
Good luck.
I don't need luck.
I need talent.
It's Betty.
That's the blue-bellied kingfisher's mating call.
I suppose if I was a blue-bellied kingfisher I'd appreciate it more.
And now, the yellow-throated oriole.
Hold it.
I got the idea.
The very next bird picture is yours.
Hi, Betty.
Your bird bit was great.
Thanks, Barney but you know it laid a big, fat, speckled egg.
- What're you doing down here?
- Just nosey, I guess.
Me, too.
Look, Barney, Wilma's on.
Okay.
Stop the music.
That's all.
Thank you, Miss.
- The first - Musical you make, you'll call me.
You were only great, Wilma.
The only thing great was that he called me Miss.
I'd better get home and start dinner.
I feel guilty.
We're all having the fun and Fred is working.
He's too sophisticated for this stuff, anyhoo.
But Gary, where is your pride?
You know the budget won't stand for a double.
I've got a new thing going, you see.
I'm taking pride in staying healthy.
But, Gary, where can I get a double for you?
That's your business.
Mine is staying alive.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Sorry, no more auditions.
Now, Gary, like, listen to reason.
I knew all that ring-a-ding you were giving these people around here was a lot of hooey.
Only a numbskull without an ounce of brains would fall for that guff.
Did you ever think of being an actor?
- Who, me?
- Sure.
You'd be perfect.
- Who, me?
- Right.
You're big, you're strong I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll divide the lead between you and Gary Granite.
The lead?
I'm worried about Granite.
He's been up a long time.
He's slipping.
- But am I good enough?
- Good enough?
- You know what I'm going to let you do?
- No, what?
All the hard stuff.
Let him do all the easy stuff.
You, my new star, will steal the picture.
Wait till Wilma hears about this.
- I'll do it.
- Good.
It's the title role.
Here's your costume.
It's just like Gary's.
- The title role?
- Yes.
The Monster from the Tar Pits.
You are the monster.
- I am?
- Sure.
You're breaking in at the top.
You don't have to worry about lines.
Just practice growling and roaring.
Like this?
Good.
Go home.
Come back tomorrow afternoon.
Keep practicing.
That's your double, Gary.
No wonder they call you the genius of the quickies.
Maybe when I get back, he'll let me call him Sandy.
Maybe Fred's right.
You can be silly about this celebrity stuff.
I should be more mature about it, like Fred is.
That must be Betty.
She said she'd be over.
Come in, Betty.
The door's open.
Wilma.
It's me, Fred.
Wake up, Wilma.
There's nothing to be scared about.
Excuse me, Wilma.
I didn't know you had company.
I'll be back later.
Get your hands off her, you monster!
Get out!
Wilma, help!
Hold it, Betty.
That's Fred's voice.
It is Fred.
What's the idea of pulling a stunt like that?
And what're you doing in that messy old suit?
This messy old suit, as you call it means that Gary Granite is on the way out and I am on the way up.
I'm doing all the hard stuff your hero, Gary Granite, can't do.
You mean you're doubling for Gary Granite?
Oh, boy, there's a woman for you, gets it all backward.
"You mean you're doubling for Gary Granite"?
Not, "Fred, you're gonna be a movie star".
Oh, no.
Barney's home.
He's coming over.
Don't let him in yet.
I'll put on my monster head and scare him.
- Anybody home?
- Okay, Wilma, let him in.
Come in, Barney.
- Hiya, Betty.
Hi, Wilma.
- Hello, Barney.
Hiya, Fred.
You going trick-or-treating tonight?
No, I am not going trick-or-treating tonight.
And if you will excuse me, I must practice my lines.
I must be ready when Granite cracks.
What's the matter, he sick or something?
What's this all about?
Fred's doing all the hard stuff in the picture that Gary Granite can't do.
You mean he's doubling for him?
Did it occur to any of you that doubling might also be interpreted as replacing Gary Granite?
- Fred.
- What is it?
Don't sit down on anything in that sticky suit.
That's right, Betty.
He just left, costume and all.
Let's face it, he's the only one who got a part.
Are you going down to watch?
No.
He said, "No visitors allowed on the set".
Oh, boy!
I've got to stop eating in those cheap restaurants.
Quiet, everybody!
We're ready to roll.
In this scene, you are climbing the cliff and at the top is Rock Pile with the girl you love.
But you are having a little trouble because Rock Pile is dropping boulders on your head.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm not.
- Prop man.
- Yeah?
- Did you get the fake boulders?
- Are you kidding?
- Do you know what they cost?
- Never mind.
We'll use real ones.
Mr. Flintstone.
Yes, Mr. Director?
- I think Granite has had it.
- Good.
- Are you ready to move in?
- Just give me the chance, that's all.
Give me the chance.
Good.
Roll 'em.
Action!
Okay, Gary.
Cut.
Okay, Flintstone.
Chicken.
Roll 'em.
Action!
Cut!
Wonderful.
Now, this is how the scene works: You, the monster, are trying to carry off the girl.
But you are having a little trouble because Rock Pile keeps hitting you on the head with his club.
- Club?
- Did anyone get a padded club?
Are you kidding?
Do you know what padded clubs cost?
Okay, we'll use a real one.
Quiet!
Roll 'em!
Action!
Cut!
Print it!
Wonderful.
You are only great.
And now, here's the ending of the picture which is also only great.
By the way, did the writer write an ending?
You're joking.
Do you know what a writer costs?
Never mind.
We'll ad-lib an ending.
Now, get this.
You're sick and tired of chasing the girl.
You know now you're never going to get her.
I don't know why.
I've been getting everything else.
So we see you walking towards the tar pits.
Back to the tar pits from whence you originated.
- By the way, have you any insurance?
- A little.
Roll 'em!
Put on the monster head.
Good.
Now start walking.
Walking into the sunset.
Back to your home, the tar pit.
You are sad.
Oh, boy!
You look back, dejected.
You wave goodbye.
Good.
Now you keep walking and you keep waving.
Walking, waving.
A little more feeling.
Great.
Cut.
Wrap it up!
You were wonderful, Gary.
Wonderful.
I know.
They'll love me in this.
Let's go, everybody.
Everything into the trucks.
We got the preview tomorrow.
I hope Sandy, I mean, Mr. Sandstone, likes it.
Did I do good?
Did I?
Barney!
What're you doing here?
You didn't show up for dinner, and Wilma got worried.
Where is everybody?
Everybody and everything left for Hollyrock half an hour ago.
You mean I've been holding my breath for over half an hour?
Yeah, and just don't hold your breath till you replace Gary Granite, either.
Yeah, I know.
I know something else, too.
I've been a chump.
A great big, fat, C-H-U-M-P dope.
So forget it.
You had a lot of fun and you found out that being in pictures is a lot of hard work and not all glitter and glamour.
Yeah.
I was never right for the part, anyway.
I'm not the monster type.
I wouldn't say that.
- What did you do with the monster suit?
- I threw it in the trash.
You had tar on every chair in the house.
Good evening.
We bring you another flash from Hollyrock.
The picture filmed in Bedrock yesterday was premiered this afternoon and was a smash hit.
Miracle Pictures plans to return tomorrow to shoot the sequel.
: The Son of the Monster from the Tar Pits a heartwarming story of a monster and his dog.
Well, how about that?
They're coming back.
This time we all won't go running down, that's for sure Wilma, where'd you throw that monster suit?
I've got to find it.
I should be a shoo-in for the part.
Oh, no.
Here it is.
Never mind dinner, Wilma.
I'm gonna be busy practicing my lines.
Let's face it.
There's a little ham in every husband.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
There's got to be some reason you're so nice to me.
Fred, I didn't buy a thing.
Now sit down and eat your dinner while I give the baby his bottle.
Okay, but I don't understand it.
Baby?
What baby?
We don't have a baby.
Isn't he cute, Fred?
Wilma, how close-mouthed can you be?
Why didn't you tell me this morning?
I would've stayed home from work.
I didn't know this morning.
He's only been here 10 minutes.
Ten minutes?
I hope you don't mind baby-sitting with him while I play bridge tonight.
Tonight?
You think you ought to?
So soon?
Come on, Fred, step on it.
I don't want to be late for work again.
Keep your fur shirt on, Barney.
I can't go any faster.
Not with all these signals.
No, not another one.
I'll get fired for sure.
Don't worry, pal.
I'll take the freeway and duck all the lights.
But, Fred, there's too much traffic on a freeway.
Not now, Barney.
The peak hour is past.
Hold on, pal, here we go.
Now, Fred.
No, hold it.
Not yet.
Now.
No, wait.
- Now.
No, hold it.
- Quiet!
I'm doing the driving, and here's our chance.
Made it.
Now watch us make time.
Where are you, Barney?
Right here.
Where else, the way you drive?
"We'll take the freeway and duck all the lights".
You and your brilliant ideas.
Hey, Fred here comes one of those little foreign jobs with the engine in the back.
How do you like that?
We sit here while he goes through.
Come on, you guys, keep moving.
It's a living.
Here we are, Barney.
Pick you up tonight.
Right, Fred.
So long.
Good morning, Mr. Rubble.
Kind of late, aren't you?
And how.
Take me up fast, will you, Lester?
Sure.
Hey, Bill, take us up to the fifth floor.
Right, Les.
Giddap, Matilda.
Good morning, Miss Pebble.
Good morning, Barney.
Mr. Granite wants to see you.
Mr. Granite?
Yeah, he's been shouting for you all morning.
Oh, boy, this is it.
I've been late every day this week.
- You wish to see me, sir?
- You bet I do.
Come in here and close that door, Rubble.
Rubble?
Last week it was Barney.
Too late for the coffee break again this morning, Rubble?
I can explain, sir.
I've been looking for you all morning.
Sit down.
Not on the floor, dumbbell.
In the chair.
Yes, sir.
Rubble, do you know what these are?
Sure, Mr. Granite.
Two tickets for tonight's fight.
Gosh, they're impossible to get.
How did you do it, Mr. Granite?
I'll tell you, Rubble.
I got them because I'm a big man in this town.
I fought, and I clawed my way up through the business jungle until today I'm on top of the heap.
King of the Jungle!
And to you, Rubble, my loyal subject I give these fight tickets I fought so hard for.
- You're giving me the tickets?
- That's right.
Gee, thanks, Mr. King of the Jungle, sir.
But how come you're not going?
My wife won't let me.
Oh, boy, here comes Fred.
Watch his eyes bug out when he sees these tickets.
Hiya, Barney.
Hop in, pal.
- What's new, Barney?
- I've been waiting for you to ask me that.
This is new.
Two tickets to tonight's fights.
Where did you get them, Barney?
The King of the Jungle gave them to me.
- Your boss?
- Yup, the queen wouldn't let him go.
His wife?
That's a riot.
His wife wouldn't let him go.
That's rich, isn't it?
Wilma, are you sure Fred won't mind baby-sitting tonight?
Of course not, Edna.
When I tell him it's the last night of the bridge tournament and how badly we need you on the team, he'll be glad to sit with little Egbert.
Sure.
And my Barney will come over and keep Fred company.
That's right, Betty.
Tonight's their night to watch the fights on TV, anyway.
Wonderful!
I'll put Egbert in your bedroom and see you in a couple of hours.
We'll pick you up, Edna.
I have the car tonight.
- Thanks a lot, girls.
So long.
- See you later.
- Are you sure Fred won't blow his top?
- No.
But just the same, I'll fix a big dinner and get him in a good mood.
That's a good idea.
I'll do the same for Barney.
With full stomachs, those two are as calm as beached whales.
- See you after dinner, Barney-boy.
- Right, Fred.
We'll get an early start.
Wilma, I'm home.
Let's eat.
Frederick, darling!
I'm so glad you're home, dearest.
Dinner is all ready.
My great big working man must be starved.
I'll set the table while you clean up.
And don't be long, honey, I've got your favorite dish tonight: Brontosaurus cutlets.
I'm in the right house, all right.
Hurry, dear.
Dinner is served.
Hold it.
All right.
Let me see it.
And how much was it?
- See what, Fred?
- The new fur dress you bought today.
- I didn't buy a new fur dress, Fred.
- All right, the new hat, then.
I didn't buy a hat, either.
There's got to be some reason you're so nice to me.
Fred, I didn't buy a thing.
Now sit down and eat your dinner while I give the baby his bottle.
Okay, but I don't understand it.
Baby?
What baby?
We don't have a baby.
Isn't he cute, Fred?
Wilma, how close-mouthed can you be?
Why didn't you tell me this morning?
I would've stayed home from work.
I didn't know this morning.
He's only been here 10 minutes.
Ten minutes?
I hope you don't mind baby-sitting with him while I play bridge tonight.
Tonight?
You think you ought to?
So soon?
We're having the playoff at the bridge club and Edna Boulder's regular baby-sitter couldn't make it.
So I told Edna you wouldn't mind sitting with her little Egbert.
Fred, you're turning red as a lobster.
Now don't blow your top.
It's my top and I'll blow it if I want to.
Do you feel better now, Fred?
Listen, Wilma, I got a big fat scoop for you.
Barney and I are going to the fights tonight.
We are not sitting for any little egghead.
- Egbert, dear.
- Okay, Egbert.
We are going to the fights.
F-l-T-E-S, fights.
And that's final.
Now you listen to me, Fred.
You and Barney are normally the most considerate men I know.
But you knew Betty and I were going to play bridge tonight.
And you said Barney and you were going to watch the fights on TV.
So I thought surely you would be kind and thoughtful enough to help us out when our bridge team is in a jam.
But you just forget it.
Don't worry about us, dear.
We girls will stay home and lose the tournament.
Okay, Wilma.
I'll stay home.
Thanks, Fred.
I don't know how I'll explain it to Barney, though.
He'll think I lost my mind.
Come in.
Hello, Fred.
Turn on the TV.
We don't want to miss the fights.
- You, too, Barney?
- Me, too, Fred.
- What happened?
- The whole bit.
You know, the big hello, the big dinner then the big news about baby-sitting.
I blew my top we yakked it up, I felt like a heel.
- And here I am.
- Women.
- You can't beat them.
- And you can't join them.
We're leaving now, boys.
Are you comfortable?
Have you got enough sandwiches?
- So long, Fred.
- So long, Barney.
And don't forget to look in on the baby.
You know, this ain't so bad, Fred.
We're comfortable, no crowds, no parking problems.
- This ain't bad at all.
- Yeah.
I guess you're right, Barney.
Hey, turn on the TV.
It's time for the big fight.
There we are, pal.
Hello there, sports fans.
Tonight's the big fight night, right?
As you know, this bout is blacked out for a radius of 25 miles in this area.
Sorry.
However, we will keep you informed with round-by-round reports.
Meanwhile, for your entertainment we have Alice Blue Jean and her magic banjo.
Miss Blue Jean.
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Fred, wait.
You'll wake the baby.
That's for Alice Blue Jean and her magic banjo!
- I'll stop that.
- Easy, Fred.
He's only a baby.
Quiet!
Gee, Fred, you sure can handle kids.
Nothing to it if you know child psychology.
Hey, the fight.
- What about it, Fred?
- We got tickets.
We could go see it.
What about Egbert?
We can't leave him alone.
We'll take him with us.
With a name like that, he's gonna have to learn how to fight.
That's funny, Fred.
- Except for one thing.
- What's that, pal?
- I tore up the tickets.
- You tore up the tickets?
That's right, Fred.
And I threw the pieces away.
He tore up the tickets.
Of all the dumb things to do.
The tickets are gone.
He tore them up.
Barney, how could you?
I hate to see a grown man cry.
Quiet!
Barney, I just thought of something.
Joe Rockhead lives outside the blacked-out area.
We'll watch the fight on his TV.
That's a great idea, Fred.
- But aren't you forgetting Egbert?
- We'll take the kid with us.
What's the difference if we baby-sit here or at Joe Rockhead's house?
- What's wrong with little Egbert?
- Search me.
- Why don't you try singing to him?
- Singing?
Okay.
Rock-a-bye baby In the treetop When the wind blows The cradle will rock When the bough breaks Quiet!
That's better.
Come on, Joe, open up.
It's Fred and Barney.
Guess he ain't home, Fred.
Hey, it's Joe's pooch.
Relax, boy, we're just gonna watch TV.
Well, there's only one thing to do.
- You gonna break the door down?
- Right.
Come on in, Barney.
Let's watch the fight.
I got to put egghead, Egbert, to bed first.
Boy, I hope the fight's not over yet.
Ladies and gentlemen!
How about that?
It's just starting.
Introducing, in this corner at 235 pounds the challenger, Rocky Gibraltar!
Attaboy, Rock.
And in this corner, wearing spotted trunks the champion, at 242 pounds Blarney Stone.
It's gonna be a good one.
Hurry up, Barney.
Coming, Fred.
Now you stay here while Uncle Barney watches the fights.
Rocky jabs with a left, the champ dances away.
And there is the bell.
What a fight.
- Barney, how's the baby?
- Sleeping like a baby.
What else?
- Sleeping like a baby?
- That's right.
What do you think just went by, a street car?
Can't you do anything right?
Put the baby to bed quick.
The next round's coming up.
Right, Fred.
Here, Egbert!
Company, halt.
About face.
Forward march.
How about that, Fred?
I guess Uncle Barney knows how to handle kids, too.
Hut, two, three, four.
On the double.
Hut, two, three four.
Company, halt.
Now, this time stay in bed like a good little egghead, okay?
That's a good little pooch.
Keep an eye on Eggy.
Rocky jabs with a left, the champ dances away.
And there's the bell.
What a fight.
Barney, come on.
You're missing all the action.
I'll be right there, Fred.
Go to sleep now, Egbert.
Uncle Barney will be in the next room.
I got the baby in bed.
- What round is it?
- Third round coming up, hurry.
Rocky comes out fast and jabs lightly.
The champ dances away.
Both boys are looking for an opening.
And now Rocky comes back strong.
And they're slugging it out, toe to toe.
- Come on, champ!
Use the right!
- Let him have it, Rocky.
They're coming out for the ninth round now.
So far the fight seems to be pretty even.
Egbert, what are you doing out of bed?
Hey, the baby jumped out of the window.
After him, Fred.
He's going around the front.
I'll head him off.
The champ is down.
He's down.
And the crowd is going wild.
- Come on, Fred.
- I'm coming, Barney.
Here's the count.
One two three four five six seven Boy!
What an office party!
I sure told the boss what I thought of him.
And that homely-looking secretary.
She kept getting prettier and prettier.
"I like you, Joe Rockhead," she says to me.
"You remind me of my mother.
Father".
My front door is busted down.
It must be burglars.
I'll catch them red-handed.
Okay, you guys, I got you surrounded.
There you are.
Stop squirming, or I'll You're a baby.
I've heard of juvenile delinquency but this is ridiculous.
Come back here, egghead.
His name is Egbert.
Whatever it is, he's the fastest kid in town.
There he goes, Barney.
He's under that rock.
- Go get him.
He likes you.
- Okay, Fred.
Egbert, it's me, Uncle Barney.
Come on out, Eggy.
Come to your Uncle Barney.
That's it, Egbert.
Hold my hand.
What's the matter with you, Barney?
Come on.
Get that kid.
He bit my finger.
So how hard can a kid bite?
Get out of my way.
I'll get him myself.
All right, egghead.
Come on out.
I got you, you little rascal.
Now, let's get this straight.
Your name is Rockhead.
You got home from an office party, your door was busted in and you captured this baby bandit in the house.
That's right, Sergeant.
They're starting pretty young these days.
Of course.
Infant delinquents.
Lock him up!
I'll figure a charge when I find out who this baby belongs to.
If there's one thing I dread, it's the office party season.
I'm getting pooped.
Look, Fred.
He climbed up the tree like it was nothing.
It must be at least 100 feet high.
Good.
We got him trapped.
A little higher, Fred.
I can't reach that first branch.
- Upsy-daisy.
- Daisy?
It's a pretty fat daisy, isn't it?
Got it, Fred.
Now hold on, Egbert.
I'll be right up.
Attaboy, Barney.
We're doing fine.
We're getting closer.
We're almost to the top.
Now grab him.
We got him!
Now what?
We had him in our hands.
He bit our finger again.
I've been watching you two.
Now what do you think you're doing?
Nothing, Officer.
Nothing at all.
Except our baby is stuck up in that tree.
Maybe you better come downtown with me.
I A baby in a tree?
I better call the fire department.
- I got him, Chief.
- Good.
Bring him down.
Boy, this kid's got sharp teeth.
Who does this baby belong to?
Me, sir.
It's little Egbert.
Here, Poppa.
I'm so grateful to Fred and Barney for baby-sitting with my little Egbert.
Think nothing of it, Edna.
They were only too happy to do it.
Girls, here's another news flash about that baby up in a tree.
Friends, that baby in a tree item reported earlier proved to be a hoax.
The baby turned out to be a little brontosaurus dressed up as a child.
A practical joke.
Some joke.
They ought to arrest whoever thought that one up.
And here's a picture of the practical jokers as they were being booked by the police.
Barney and Fred?
If they're in jail, where's my baby?
Talking about babies, we have one that is lost.
If you know this little fellow please contact the police at once.
It's my Egbert.
Okay, lady, take your baby home.
But keep an eye on him.
We're not too sure he didn't try to rob a house.
Sergeant, could we see those two terrible men who put the brontosaurus in the tree?
I don't know why, but go ahead.
Thank you, Sergeant.
Hiya, Betty.
All right, let's hear it.
It better be good, Barney.
It all started when the TV was blacked out And I tore up the tickets and the baby jumped out of the window and Skip it.
We'll see you in 30 days.
It'll take longer than that to explain the whole story.
What are you guys doing in jail?
- Hey, that's Joe Rockhead.
- Hiya, Joe.
Wait till you guys hear what happened to me.
I came home from a party, see, and guess what?
Your door was broken down.
Yeah, but you'll never guess what I found inside.
- A baby.
- Right.
But how did you guys know?
It's going on all the time, Joe.
It's going on all the time.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
It's Granite Boy still in the lead then Fossil second by two lengths, Volcano third.
But wait a minute.
Sabertooth is starting to move up on the outside.
- He said "Sabertooth," Barney.
- I know.
Come on, Sabertooth!
Heading for the far turn, it's Granite Boy in front Fossil is second, Sabertooth is third, Slagheap fourth Volcano, Earthquake, and Gravelpit.
Coming into the stretch, Sabertooth takes the lead with Fossil second, then Granite Boy, Slagheap Volcano, Earthquake, and Gravelpit.
Watch this, Barney-boy.
Seven ball, the easy way.
- Sorry, Barney.
- Great shot, Fred.
Nothing, Barney.
Watch this one.
Looks like you're in trouble with the eight ball.
Are you kidding?
All you need is the right tool for any job.
Here's the one I was looking for.
Eight ball, the impossible way.
Watch this, Barney.
The trick shot to end all trick shots.
Fred, we are going to enter you in the Olympics.
And why not?
Hey, Dan, how about some cue chalk?
Coming.
Here you are.
Use it in good health.
I won't be bringing it to you much longer.
- Why not, Dan?
- I'm selling the place.
You're kidding.
No kidding.
I'm retiring to that little chicken ranch.
Get it?
I'm only asking $2,000 for it, lock, stock, and barrel.
Funny thing you should mention this, right, Barney?
Mention what, Fred?
My friend and I have been looking for a deal just like this haven't we, Barney?
- Who?
- Us, that's who.
One thing though, fellas.
The deal has got to be strictly cash.
Cash?
Excuse me, fellas.
Got to get the phone.
What's the idea of kicking me, Fred?
Don't you get it?
This place is a gold mine.
If we could buy it, we could get rich and be our own bosses.
Yeah, and another thing, we could play every day for nothing.
Well, you can forget it.
We could never raise that kind of money.
$2,000.
You know, I had $2,000 in my hand this afternoon.
- $2,000?
- Yup.
I was making a bet for the boss with a guy named Herman.
Your tightwad boss betting on races?
Yup.
Sabertooth in the fifth, at 40-to-1.
40-to-1?
He must think it's a sure thing.
Look, if old tightwad bets on it, it is.
Did I tell you he locks the paper clips in the safe every night?
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.
Barney, we own a business.
Like how?
We go to the track tomorrow, bet $50 at 40-to-1 and what do we get?
- We get to play pool for nothing.
- Oh, boy.
- One little thing, Fred.
- Yeah?
- Have you got the $50?
- No, have you?
We were sure living there for a couple of minutes.
Wish I had the nerve to use my pay.
Why not?
Because Wilma would kill me, that's why not.
- Well, tell her you lost it.
- I tried that once.
Oh, no.
Wilma's too smart.
- Look, suppose somebody held you up?
- Suppose they did.
Wilma couldn't blame me for that.
What an idea!
How do I think of them?
You're a genius, Fred, that's how.
A sheer genius.
- What's wrong?
- Wilma will still kill me if she finds out.
So you'll die rich.
After all, it's for Wilma's sake.
That's right, I'm doing it for her.
I'll be able to give the little woman all the things she deserves.
All right, Barney.
Now get this straight.
You're going in first, and you break the news to Wilma.
Yeah.
I'll lay it on good and thick.
And then when you get her wailing and crying, I'll stagger in.
She'll be so glad to see me, she won't even think about the money.
Okay, pal.
But just give me enough time.
- I almost forgot.
- Forgot what, Fred?
Here, you better hold my pay envelope.
- But what for?
- Lf Wilma finds it on me our holdup story's in the ash can, that's what for.
Get going.
Fred's not home, Barney.
Wilma, I only hope he makes it home.
What are you talking about?
I don't know how to break this to you, Wilma but a terrible thing happened.
Fred was on his way home, and two guys jump him in the alley.
They gave him a terrible beating.
He tried to defend himself but they overpowered him, and took his whole week's pay.
Now, Wilma, take it easy.
Don't get hysterical.
- I don't believe one word of it.
- But, Wilma - Not one word.
- But, Wilma, wait till you see him.
A little dirt on the face.
Rip the fur a little.
That ought to do it.
I tell you, I don't believe it.
Easy, pal.
Try to hold on, Fred.
You know we all love you.
I know.
Especially Wilma.
Take it easy, honey.
I'm going to be all right.
Don't be hysterical.
Stop crying.
Just be glad I'm alive.
What did you do with the money?
The money?
What kind of a wife are you?
- Three tough guys jumped me and - Barney said there were two.
Two?
Well, one of them was a midget.
Barney couldn't see him.
It's the phone.
You two midget brains better think of something better before I get back.
I'm coming.
How about a woman like that?
She's tough to convince, that's all I can say.
I'd have to be half-dead before she'd even half-believe me.
We gotta do something, Fred.
And fast.
I hate to do this, Fred.
One, two, three, four.
Testing.
He's out like a light.
- Now what?
- Fred just keeled over.
- From what?
Overacting?
- No, from this bump.
Oh, my poor husband.
He's coming to.
Fred, will you ever forgive me for doubting you?
Watch him, Barney, while I get some cold water and a towel.
Say something, Fred.
You knucklehead.
Are you trying to kill me?
I had to think of something quick.
What else could I do?
I'm thinking of something quick now.
Can you guess what I'm gonna do?
Now, Fred, I just called the doctor and you're not to stir till he gets here.
I'd like to stir Barney.
With a bat, that is.
Hey, Doc, what's all that Search me.
I saw a doctor do it on a TV show once.
Quiet, please, while I test the reflexes.
Just what I thought.
Concussion of the concuss mit complications.
- Complications?
- Ja.
Bumpus of the nogginus.
"Bumpus of the nogginus"?
What's that?
- Search me.
L - I know, you saw it on a TV show.
Now, one week in bed feed him liquids, soft foods, rest and quiet, and all that jazz.
I'll take good care of him, Doctor.
Good.
Then I got to hurry now.
What is it, Doctor?
An emergency?
What emergency?
I got to go home and watch TV.
- Fred, how's it going?
- Terrible.
She won't let me out of here.
She watches me like a hawk.
Tell her you got to go to work.
I did, so she called the boss.
She told him I'd be out for a week.
The last bus leaves for the track in an hour.
- I'll go down and bet the money.
- You?
What do you know about betting at the track?
- "I saw it on a TV show once".
- Now, cut that out.
If anybody goes, we go together.
Oh, no, you don't.
You're not going anyplace.
I'm going to the market to get some brontosaurus soup bones and don't you dare move while I'm gone.
I guess it's goodbye to Boulder Dan's place.
- Yeah, we're dead.
- Gee, I sure hate to give up.
- It's a cinch.
- What's a cinch?
You know the fellow you bet the boss's $2,000 with?
- What's his name?
- You mean Herman.
That's it, Fred.
Where's the phone?
Hello, Herman?
$50 on Sabertooth in the fifth.
Right on the nose.
Yeah, right on the nose.
You got it, Herman?
Herman, you got it?
I regret that due to circumstances beyond my control I cannot conduct business any further at this time.
But, Herman, listen.
Herman, you gotta But Well?
Herman's out of business.
So we're out of business.
No, we're not.
We just got time to catch the last bus for the track.
Come on.
- What will you tell Wilma?
- I'll think of something later.
Hold that bus!
Hold it!
Just made it.
Oh, boy, if we missed it, we'd have had to walk.
Entries for the fifth race now entering the paddock.
Here they come.
Sabertooth is number five.
There's nothing more beautiful than a thoroughbred dinosaur.
If you ask me, they're breeding them a little too fine.
There he is.
Number five.
It's Sabertooth.
Smart-looking jockey, too.
What's the matter with him?
Don't worry, that's the way I like to see a dinosaur I'm betting on.
He's saving his strength.
Come on, let's go.
We got to bet.
That's right, $50 on Sabertooth to win.
Let me see the ticket, Fred.
That ain't just a ticket, friend.
That's our declaration of independence.
Right.
I can see it up there in lights: "Fred and Barney, Money Unlimited".
It's not the money, Barney.
It's what I'm going tell old Gravelpuss that I'm looking forward to.
- Yeah, your boss.
- You mean he's going be my ex-boss.
- I'm gonna walk into his office.
- Yeah, Fred.
I'm gonna take one of his cigars and light it.
Yeah, Fred.
I'm gonna grab hold of his nose and say Boss.
Flintstone, I thought you were sick.
I am, I got bumpus of the nogginus.
Look.
What are you doing here at the track?
Ask him, he's the one that's carrying.
Well, make it a good story.
We came down here to put $50 on Sabertooth's nose so we could make enough to buy Boulder Dan's billiard parlor and retire Bigmouth.
Retire?
Don't pay any attention to him, boss.
He's out of his mind.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
What am I saying?
I'm going into business for myself.
Put me down, Barney.
Flintstone, I ought to fire you.
Look, I'm scared.
Next year I might buy your cheap establishment and fire you.
Then I won't have to listen to your barking and whining anymore.
Now that you're out of a job, I'm worried about one thing.
Suppose Sabertooth doesn't win.
Listen, if we're gonna be partners you got to start thinking positive, right now.
Like, Sabertooth will win.
Excuse me, sir.
Coming through, sir.
$1,000 on number seven.
That's Gravelpit, son.
Yes, sir, Colonel.
Here you are, Colonel.
- Did you hear that?
- I sure did.
He bet $1,000 on Gravelpit.
That's right, son.
$1,000 on Gravelpit.
I can't lose.
- Say, want a real tip, son?
- Yeah, sure.
Don't bet on the races!
That's a joke, son.
- Say, who was that?
- Him?
He owns Sabertooth.
- But he just bet on Gravelpit.
- So who's betting on Sabertooth?
- We are, and we want to change our bet.
- Too late, fellows.
They're off and running.
Fossil goes to the front.
Granite Boy second, Slagheap a close third.
Volcano and Earthquake head and head fourth.
Gravelpit is fifth and Sabertooth.
Into the clubhouse turn.
Fossil still in front by a length.
Granite Boy second Volcano moving up to third.
Slagheap a close fourth.
Then comes Earthquake, Gravelpit, and Sabertooth.
Oh, boy.
Going into the backstretch.
Granite Boy challenges Fossil and takes the lead.
Come on, Gravelpit!
Come on, Sabertooth.
Did you say "Sabertooth," son?
I told you all: Don't bet on the races.
Come on, Gravelpit.
It's Granite Boy still in the lead then Fossil, second by two lengths, Volcano third.
But wait a minute.
Sabertooth is starting to move up on the outside.
- He said "Sabertooth," Barney.
- I know.
Come on, Sabertooth!
Heading for the far turn, it's Granite Boy in front Fossil is second, Sabertooth is third, Slagheap fourth Volcano, Earthquake, and Gravelpit.
Coming into the stretch, Sabertooth takes the lead with Fossil second, then Granite Boy, Slagheap Volcano, Earthquake, and Gravelpit.
At the eighth pole.
It's Sabertooth by a leg.
Fossil is second, then Granite Boy third Slagheap, Volcano, Earthquake, and Gravelpit.
They're coming to the finish line with Sabertooth still in front.
Here they come.
Watch it closely.
And the winner is Gravelpit!
Did he say "Gravelpit"?
That's what he said, son.
Gravelpit.
Gee, if there's one thing I can't stand it's to see a grown man cry.
Attention, please.
It's a photo finish.
The official result in just a moment.
- Cross your fingers, Barney.
- I am.
- And your toes, too.
- I am.
I'm crossing them.
And here comes the photo.
The photo is in the judge's hands.
The judge is studying the photo.
And we'll have the official decision in just a moment.
Just a moment now.
And here it is, folks.
: The winner is Sabertooth!
Like you said, sir: "Don't bet on the races".
We're a couple of jolly good fellows A couple of jolly good fellows Yeah, what, Barney?
Have you decided what you're gonna tell Wilma?
I'm gonna tell her the truth that her husband is gonna be a big business tycoon.
You better let me hold the money.
- What for?
- Just in case she don't like the idea.
You got something there.
You know how wives are.
If she heard about this money, she'd make me do something dumb with it.
Yeah, like put it in the bank.
But I'm not trusting you with all this dough.
We're gonna stash it someplace safe.
How about stashing it under that rock over there?
- This is heavy.
- All the better to keep the money under.
- Look and see if anyone's around.
- Okay, Fred.
Nobody in sight.
Let's go.
Get this rock off my hand so I can tear you apart.
How did you get it caught?
I didn't get it caught.
I put it under here to keep it warm.
- Get it off, you imbecile!
- I'm getting it off.
As I thought, the holdup story was a fake.
Now, what did you do with the money?
- You want to know?
- Yes, I want to know.
We went out to the track, and we bet the whole thing on a long shot.
You what?
You mean to tell me that you took the money for our food and rent that you We won.
- You won?
- Yup.
$2,000, right on the nose.
Darling, we're rich!
Now wait a minute, we got plans for it.
- Plans?
- We are investing in a business.
- What business?
- Boulder Dan's place.
Fred, that's wonderful!
That place is a gold mine.
I met Dan's wife today.
She has a new fur coat.
He's retiring and they're moving South.
And where's the money?
Now relax, honey.
I'll have the money in your hands in a couple of shakes.
- Well, Wilma's got to admit it.
- What's that, Fred?
She's married to a pretty sharp businessman with lots of brains, know-how, and savvy.
Betty feels the same way about me.
And throw in "good-looking".
Okay, good-looking.
Grab a hold of the rock.
And this time, be careful.
- All right, now.
Heave.
- I'm heaving, Fred.
Easy, that's it.
Steady, Barney.
There it is.
I got it, Barney.
You mean you had it, buster.
- What is this?
- It's a stickup, hey, that's what it is.
Hand it over, hey.
- Over my dead body.
- That's okay with me.
Hold him, Fred.
We got him surrounded.
Once again will do it.
Barney, where is Fred?
I don't know how to break this to you.
A terrible thing just happened.
When we went to get the money, a guy jumped on us.
A big guy.
Fred fought like a tiger, but the guy was too tough.
And he took the money.
Now don't get hysterical, Wilma.
He'll be all right.
Let me help you, pal.
Take it easy, Wilma.
I'm gonna be all right.
Don't get hysterical.
Stop crying.
Just be glad I'm alive.
- I don't believe a word of it.
- But, Wilma Not one single, solitary word.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
There's the bell.
That's the old footwork, Barney.
Barney hasn't hit him yet.
Barney couldn't hit the floor with his hat.
- How am I doing, pal?
- Great, pal.
Just great.
- Fred?
Oh, Fred?
- Yeah, Wilma.
Have you seen the newspaper?
I'm reading it.
- Can I have a piece of it, please?
- Okay.
Just a minute.
Here.
Now don't get it all mixed up.
I haven't read that section yet.
- Thanks, Fred.
- You're welcome.
- Hey, Fred.
- Barney.
Come on in, pal.
No.
You come out, Fred.
I want you to do me a favor.
All right.
I'll be right out.
Favors.
That's all that Barney wants.
What a neighbor.
Before you even ask, I'm telling you I'm broke.
That I know, Fred.
But can you keep a secret?
Secret?
What secret?
You know how Betty keeps harping about how I never bought her an engagement ring before we was married?
Yeah, I should know.
Wilma gives me the same routine.
I've got a surprise for Betty.
Get a load of this.
Wow!
What a sparkler!
How did you get it, Barney?
A down payment at the Buddy Buddy Credit Jewelers.
How else?
Four hundred and twenty easy payments and it's mine.
That's great.
Just great.
When are you gonna spring the big surprise on Betty?
I don't want to give it to her till Saturday.
So do me a favor, will you, pal?
You keep it in your house till then and that way Betty won't accidentally find it - and spoil my surprise.
- Okay, Barney-boy.
- What a shiny rock!
- But be careful with it, Fred.
Don't worry, Barney.
It'll be safe with old Fred.
Thanks a lot, pal.
That Fred.
He's one of the good ones.
Now let's see.
Where will I hide the ring so Wilma won't find it and blab to Betty?
Wait a minute.
That's it.
I'll hide it in the flour.
With all these new frozen pies, Wilma never does any baking anymore.
That'll do it.
Fred.
Hiya, Wilma.
What in the world are you doing up on that chair?
What do you think I'd be doing up on a chair?
- I saw a mouse.
That's what.
- Okay.
You're in one of your mysterious moods today.
Have fun.
That's the old fast thinking.
Freddie-boy, the quick ad-lib artist.
Yes, sir.
What's that sound?
I haven't heard that for years.
Oh, yeah, the egg beater.
Wilma must be making a cake.
A cake!
The ring!
Hold it!
What do you think you're doing?
I think I'm making a cake for my loudmouth husband who is acting like he flipped his lid today.
I don't want a cake, Wilma.
It's too Go ahead, Fred.
Say it.
I dare you.
Okay.
It's too fattening.
I've got to watch my weight, don't I?
That ought to be easy.
There's so much to watch.
Droll.
Very droll.
You made a real funny.
Now what's he up to?
Fred, why did you take the flour into the bedroom?
- Fred, come out of there.
- You called, Wilma?
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your mind?
Go take a shower and let the cold water run on your head.
The ring wasn't in the flour canister, so it's got to be in the batter.
Fred!
What are you peeking around corners for?
I didn't want to startle you.
I was going to run over and borrow an egg from Betty but I don't know if I should leave you alone.
What do you mean?
I'm all right.
Go ahead.
Okay.
But I'll be right back.
She's gone.
Now's my chance to get that ring.
Fred, when are you going to grow up?
Get your hand out of that batter and help me with this dodo egg.
Imagine.
Eating cake batter.
Why, you can't even wait until I bake the cake you don't want.
There.
Finally in the oven.
Now, Fred, you stay away from this oven.
- Lf you open it, the cake will fall.
- All right.
Fred's in an odd mood today.
I'd better leave him alone for a while.
I'd better not.
I'll get the ring out of the cake after it's baked.
I'll go ahead and read a book, get it off my mind.
"And the big bad saber-toothed tiger asked Little Red Riding Hood "what she had in the basket.
"She opened the basket and said, 'I'm going to give Grandma this nice cake".
Cake?
That did it.
Now it's on my mind again.
I bet I could get that ring out without Wilma knowing it.
I did it.
Fred, I asked you not to open that oven door.
I said, "Fred, don't open that oven door".
But, no.
Nosey has to open the oven door and see what's inside.
So that will be the last cake I ever baked for you.
You want me to take the garbage can out?
No.
I'll do it myself.
- I'll get the ring out of the can later.
- That was lucky.
- The garbage truck was just passing by.
- The garbage truck!
Oh, no!
This is a stickup.
Raise your hands and don't turn around.
Okay, I've got what I want.
Put your hands down and just keep moving.
I just don't get it.
What kind of a screwball would hijack a garbage truck?
It wasn't easy but I got it.
Now to make sure that won't happen again.
Let's see.
I'll try the closet this time.
That's it.
The bowling ball.
I'll hide the ring in the finger hole.
She'll never find it in this old bowling ball.
Now I'll tell Barney it's hidden in a safe place.
Barney!
Why is it men refuse to close doors?
Even the closet door is open.
There.
That old bowling ball.
I'll put that in a safe place.
I'll bury it in the yard.
No!
It's a diamond ring.
No wonder Fred was acting so mysterious today.
Bless his little fat heart.
I don't want to spoil Fred's surprise.
But I've just got to show this to Betty before I put it back.
Wilma, it's simply gorgeous.
I wish I could get Barney to get me one.
But he's so - Conservative?
- No.
- Frugal?
- No.
Cautious?
No, but when you get to "stingy" slow down, you'll be getting warm.
I bet if you hinted to Barney, he'd get you one.
That's how I got this.
I hinted for 10 years.
But it paid off.
Well, maybe if I hint twice as hard, it'll only take me five years.
I know this sounds nutty but I've got to get back and put my ring back in the bowling ball.
Bye, Wilma.
You lucky girl.
That's right, Barney.
When I make a promise, I keep it.
I've got that ring hidden where no one can find it.
You're a real pal, Freddie-boy.
- And real lucky too.
- Lucky nothing.
That's the way I played it.
I have to get home now, Barney.
Wilma was pretty sore when I left.
- I'll see you later, pal.
- So long, Fred.
Wilma, honey.
May I come in?
Darling, you're home at last.
You lie down and rest while I fix you a few dinosaur steak sandwiches.
My mother was wrong, Fred.
You are a swell guy.
I'll be right back with the food, Jack.
She's flipped.
I've gone too far.
Fred, look.
Strike.
Get it?
It's all my fault.
I've been a bad husband.
Strike?
Yeah, I get it.
- Don't tell me you found the ring.
- Yes, Fred.
And it's the sweetest thing you ever did.
- But, Wilma, you don't understand.
- Yes, I do, Fred.
- No.
- I know how you must have scrimped and saved for 10 years to get me this ring.
And to think you love me that much just chokes me up.
When Barney finds out, I'm the one that's gonna get all choked up.
- Look, Fred.
Isn't it lovely?
- Yeah.
Wear it in good health.
Hey, Barney!
- Is that you, Fred?
- Yeah.
Come on up here, I've got something to tell you.
Be right with you, good old frugal Fred.
What's on your mind, pal?
Barney, would you do me a favor?
You just name it, pal.
Just name it.
Will you forget about the ring for Betty?
I just gave it to Wilma.
You're a card, Fred.
"Forget about the ring, I just gave it to Wilma".
Hilarious.
I'm not kidding.
I mean it.
Before you lose your temper, let me explain.
And that's the whole story, Barney.
- I don't know what to do.
- Cheer up, Fred.
The solution is very simple.
We'll go to the Buddy Buddy Jewelers and buy another ring for Betty, which you will pay for.
Right, pal.
And I'm only too glad to help you out.
I'll be right with you gentlemen as soon as I finish with that customer over there.
Sure, take your time.
598, 599, 600.
Congratulations.
With the 600th monthly payment the pop-up toaster is yours.
Thanks.
- May I have my collateral back now?
- Certainly.
Bring Mr. Slate's collateral.
He just made his final payment.
- There you are, Mr. Slate.
- Hi, children.
- Who's that man, sis?
- Why, I think it's Daddy.
Let's go home, children.
Mama will make some nice pop-up toast for you.
Now, what can I do for you gentlemen?
We are interested in a diamond ring.
- Who isn't?
- A diamond engagement ring.
- For your girl?
- No, for my wife.
An engagement ring for your wife?
At least it's a step in the right direction.
Next thing you know, you'll want a wedding ring.
Now you cut that out.
Fred and Wilma have been married for years.
And you keep out of this, shorty.
You've got enough to worry about with your big fat payment book.
Were you going to pay cash or credit?
- Credit.
- Okay.
I'll have to check your credit rating.
What's your name?
Fred F. Flintstone.
I have a Fred Flintstone, got anything on him?
No kidding.
He tried what?
No.
Blackball?
Nothing over the price of a postage stamp?
Got you.
Thanks.
Out!
And don't come back unless you've got cash.
- What'll we do, Fred?
- I don't know, Barney.
But it all boils down to its simplest form.
Yeah.
Somehow we've got to get some cash.
Barney, look at that sign.
- So what, Fred?
- Don't you get it?
It's our big chance to make $500.
No matter how much we need the money, I refuse to let you fight the Champ.
Not me.
You.
Okay, I refuse to let me fight the Champ.
You don't have to fight him, it says stay with him.
Speed will do it.
And you're fast on your feet.
Come on, Barney, say you'll fight him.
I promise you he won't lay a glove on you.
Okay.
Pick out a good ring, wise guy, we'll be back with the cash after Barney fights the Champ tonight.
If I was as fast with my head as I am with my feet I could think my way out of this.
- Hello, girls.
- Hello, Edna.
- How's the baby?
- He's fine, Betty.
By the way, aren't you the lucky one?
What do you mean?
I mean the diamond ring Barney bought you.
You must be mistaken, Edna.
Fred bought a ring for Wilma.
My dear, I'm not mistaken.
I was in the store when Barney bought you a ring.
You mean Fred bought me a ring.
No.
You girls seem to be a little confused.
I suggest you check with the Buddy Buddy Credit Jewelers.
Here's the place, Betty.
We'll get to the bottom of this.
All I know is these two gentlemen came in to buy a ring.
They needed cash, so the little fellow is going to fight the Champ tonight to pay for the ring.
Did you ever hear of anything so dumb?
I think it's the nicest, sweetest thing I've ever heard.
Me, too.
You mean man, you.
Wilma, the Champ will kill my Barney.
Maybe if I paid him not to hurt Barney.
I have some money saved up.
I have some, too, and you're welcome to it.
I read somewhere that the Champ is all heart.
I'm sure he'll understand.
Now let me see if I've got this straight.
You dames want to give me $500 to let this Barney guy stay three minutes with the Champ.
Right?
That's right.
Den I mean then you pay Barney the $500.
And you won't be out a cent, because it's our money you'll be giving him.
This may sound crass, girls, but what's in it for me and the Champ?
You'll be doing a good deed.
- And you'll feel better for it.
- Okay, so I feel better.
But what are you dames doing it for?
We dames are doing it for love.
Why didn't you say so?
Give me the money.
I'll do anything for love.
Love of money, that is.
Thank you very much, sir.
You're a dear.
Farewell, girls.
Vivian Lamore.
That's French.
- Hey, Champ.
- Yeah, boss.
This Barney guy, tonight.
The first punch.
Get it?
Got you, boss.
It's almost time for them to be leaving.
Remember now, play it straight.
What excuse do you think they'll use to get out?
Fred always uses the sick-friend-in-the-hospital routine.
Wilma, I'll bet you a nickel they use Barney's story about the brakes giving out on the car.
- You set, pal?
- Yeah.
I guess we'd better get started.
Boy, were you lucky, Barney.
You could've got killed.
You said it, Fred, I've just got to get those brakes fixed.
- Will you come with me, Fred?
- Why, sure.
And on the way back, we can stop off at the hospital and see how poor old Bill is coming along.
Say, girls.
Go ahead, Barney, get those brakes fixed.
And say hello to poor old Bill, Fred.
It's a shame to fool the girls with that old line.
It beats me how they always fall for it, though.
How about that.
They used both stories.
- They wanted to make sure they'd get out.
- And we'd better get started too.
I want to see Barney win the $500.
Come on, Barney.
Be a good guy.
- No.
- You said you'd do it.
- But - What's the matter?
You turning chicken?
You're not kidding.
And now, ladies and gents the special attraction of the evening introducing at 265 pounds and wearing leopard trunks, the Champ.
And in this corner Hey, where's the challenger?
Here he is.
We're ready.
Doesn't Barney look terrific, Wilma?
He looks sort of green to me, Betty.
- It must be the spotlights.
- I guess so, only they're white.
- How are you feeling, Barney?
- I'm kind of worried.
There's nothing to worry about, I'm right behind you.
That's my biggest worry.
I'd dread this if I didn't know the fight was fixed so Barney'd win.
There's the bell.
That's the old footwork, Barney.
- Barney hasn't hit him yet.
- Barney couldn't hit the floor with his hat.
- How am I doing, pal?
- Great, pal.
Just great.
I'll give him the good old double-knuckle punch.
We've been double-crossed.
Snap out of it, Barney.
Come on, say something to me, pal.
It's all right.
It's all right.
Just a minute, you big bully.
You and your manager stole our money.
It's the churchy lafem.
I'll teach you to pick on defenseless women.
What a wallop.
Just a minute, buster.
There's a little matter of my $500.
Betty, look.
I just won $500 for knocking out the Champ.
And I've got my $500 from his manager.
Gosh, Betty, we can't let the boys know about this.
Oh, no.
That would spoil everything.
I have an idea.
If the manager will help us out.
Sure, lady.
Anything you say.
Anything.
I'm sorry, Fred.
I guess I let you down.
No, you didn't, Barney.
I'm proud of you.
You did all right.
I've been looking for you guys.
You won the $500.
- We won?
- Yeah.
When we checked the time, we found out you stayed the full three minutes so the money is yours.
Barney-boy, did you hear that?
We won.
Buddy Buddy Credit Jewelers, here we come.
Here they are.
Remember, act surprised.
We better put our overshoes on.
We're in for a big snow job.
Girls.
Hail the conquering hero.
- Conquering hero?
- What happened?
Your husband just stayed three minutes with the Champ and won $500.
I was just lucky.
My footwork must have dazzled him.
Lucky for Betty, you mean.
Because Barney has just bought you a present.
A present?
For little old me?
- Show her, sport.
- Sweetie, this is for you.
- A diamond engagement ring.
- Just like mine.
Barney, what a wonderful surprise.
Fred, you guys are pretty swell.
You girls deserve it.
You know the old saying, Wilma.
"A husband is a girl's best friend".
Come on, Wilma, open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Looks like everybody in Hollyrock has come to see the telecast.
Lucky for us we're friends of the stars.
Look, Betty.
There's Fred and the producer.
You can run along now, J.B. I'll take over from here.
After all, I'm the star.
Be sure and have that spotlight on me all the time.
Here's some music I wrote last night.
Use it to bridge into the second act.
If you forget a line don't worry, I will cover for you.
I gotta stop him.
If the show goes over I'll be saddled with him for the whole season.
And I can't take that.
Come to the window, Wilma.
Hi, Betty.
What's up?
They're going to announce the winners on that slogan contest we entered.
- Hurry over.
- Warm up the set, I'll be right there.
Gee, Wilma.
- Do you think we stand a chance?
- I don't know why not.
We figured out some pretty good slogans together.
I think the first one "Mother McGuire's meatballs don't bounce" is a natural.
And I like the other one, too.
"If you eat a Mother McGuire meatball, you'll never eat another".
If either one of them win, we split the prize between us, right?
Right.
Keep your fingers crossed, Wilma.
And turn the set on.
Here's hoping, partner.
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.
Mother McGuire's meatballs are on the air.
We are the meatballs from Mother McGuire Of our flavor you'll never tire When you buy us you show good sense We're made of the finest ingredients - Love those animated commercials.
- They're so cute.
And now, friends, the announcement you've all been waiting for.
The winner of the Mother McGuire meatball slogan contest is Mrs. Betty Rubble and Mrs. Fred Flintstone of Bedrock.
We won!
Congratulations, girls, for the winning slogan.
: "Mother McGuire's meatballs don't bounce.
" And, ladies and gentlemen they don't.
For submitting the winning slogan Mrs. Rubble and Mrs. Flintstone win a trip for two to that glamorous city of movie and TVstars.
: Hollyrock.
Wilma, can you imagine?
Hollyrock.
- We'll need new clothes.
- And sunglasses.
- We'll see all the movie stars.
- We'll really live it up.
- We'll have the grandest time.
- And how.
- What's the matter, Wilma?
- Our husbands.
- What about them?
- They'd never let us go without them.
That's right.
What's the matter with us?
We're living in a dream world.
Betty, there's only one thing to do.
We'll toss a coin and either you and Barney go, or Fred and I go.
That sounds fair.
- It would have been fun together, Wilma.
- It sure would have, Betty.
I'm sure glad I'm only a bird.
Just getting a cracker is a big deal for me.
- See you in the morning, Barney-boy.
- Right, Fred.
It's your turn to drive tomorrow.
So long.
Wilma, Poopy's home.
Let's eat.
Let's feed the face.
Fred, wait till I tell you what happened today.
Later, Wilma.
Start the nourishment coming.
I am starved.
Fred, do you remember that slogan contest I entered last month?
Yeah.
Yeah, I remember telling you not to waste your time.
You were wrong.
I won a trip for two to Hollyrock.
- Hollyrock?
- That's right.
Boy, am I lucky.
We'll hobnob with the stars.
We'll eat at the Brown Pandora.
We'll stroll along Hollyrock Boulevard.
Come on, Wilma.
Let's get packed.
I'll eat at the airport.
Fred.
Just a minute.
- Leave a note for the milkman, Wilma.
- Fred, listen to me.
Come on, Wilma, stop yakking and start packing.
Fred, will you listen?
It's not all set.
It depends.
Depends?
Depends on what?
Who?
Where?
- It depends on Betty and Barney.
- Betty and Barney?
They're not coming with us.
That's out.
Fred, sit down a minute and let me explain.
It started like this And that's what happened.
So Betty and I decided the only fair thing to do was toss for it.
So Wilma and I decided the only fair thing to do is toss for it.
We'll have to watch Fred.
- He used to have a two-headed coin.
- Barney, I'm ashamed of you.
- Fred wouldn't cheat his best friends.
- Yeah, all right.
I'm sorry, Betty.
That wasn't very nice of me, was it?
Well, here goes.
One toss to see who goes to Hollyrock.
- Ready?
- Ready.
I'll take heads.
You can't have heads.
I always take heads.
Well, you're tossing, so I get to call it.
Okay, wise guy.
You toss and I will call heads.
Fred, let me see that coin.
Oh, Wilma.
Let me see it, Fred.
Just as I thought.
You're using that two-headed coin.
- What are you trying to do, Fred, cheat?
- Who me?
Of course not.
It was just a gag.
Just for a gag we'll let Barney toss with a regular coin.
Okay, here goes.
You call it, Fred.
Heads.
It's tails.
We win, Betty.
Hooray.
We go to Hollyrock.
How about that?
Ain't that something, Fred?
Yeah, Barney.
That's swell.
Congratulations, Betty.
You and Barney will have a wonderful time.
Yeah.
I guess so.
- Barney?
- Hey, Fred.
How about making it two out of three?
Barney, you're a pal.
Okay.
I'll take heads again.
Heads it is.
Now we're even.
- Toss again, Barney.
- Okay.
Here goes.
Heads again.
I win.
You hear that, Wilma.
I won.
Hollyrock, here we come.
Get the bags, start packing.
Look.
- Good night, Wilma.
Have a nice trip.
- Good night, Fred.
Wait a minute, you guys.
How about making it three out of four, Barney?
It's tails, I think.
Keep tossing, Barney.
We'll make it best 75 out of 100.
Come on, you two.
We're not getting anywhere tossing that coin.
Yeah, you're right, Wilma.
And I got a solution.
- Yes, Fred?
- Go on, what is it?
- Barney and I will go.
- No, you won't.
We wouldn't trust you out there for one minute.
Yeah.
Surrounded by all those starlets.
Can you imagine that, Barney?
They wouldn't trust us surrounded by all those starlets.
Neither would I. If anybody goes it should be Betty and me.
After all, we won the contest.
You're right, Wilma.
You two girls go to Hollyrock.
- Do you mean it?
- Sure I mean it.
It's okay with you, isn't it, Barney?
Yeah, I guess so.
- Gee, thanks, Barney.
- Don't mention it.
- We'll get packed right away.
- Bring all your summer clothes.
Our cameras, don't forget our cameras.
And we'll have to get an autograph book.
Do you get it?
They'll be gone a whole week.
We can stay out as late as we want.
Bowl every night.
Why, it's a chance of a lifetime.
- How about that, Barney-boy?
- Hooray.
Well, they're on the plane, Barney.
Boy, what a speedy looking job.
Speedy is right.
That's one of those Boeing jet jobs.
Ready for take off.
- Roger, fire engine one.
- Fire one.
They're ready to take off.
- Goodbye, Wilma.
- Goodbye, Betty.
- Goodbye, Fred.
- Goodbye, Barney.
Don't forget to feed the cat.
Here she comes, Barney.
Look at them go, Barney.
- Do you think they're safe, Fred?
- Of course.
These modern planes fly with only two birds if necessary.
That's sure nice to know.
Barney, we're as free as a bird.
I feel like a bird in a guilty cage.
Come on.
We'll bowl a game or two.
It'll cheer you up.
Strike!
How's about that, Barney?
How about you guys calling it quits?
It's after 1:00.
I'd like to close the place.
I suppose you're one of those poor guys that's gotta get home at a certain time?
That sounds good to me, Fred.
Why, the night is young, Barney.
What are we gonna do now?
How about going home, Fred?
Home?
We can go home anytime.
We are night people now.
We don't go home until it starts getting light.
Barney, I just remembered I know a place where there's all-night roller skating.
- Come on, Barney, let's go.
- What?
This is what I call living.
Barney, where are you going?
Wait for me.
Barney, come back.
Barney, are you all right?
Speak to me.
Say something.
That looks pretty good, Barney.
Move over.
- Hey, Barney!
- What is it, Fred?
What do you say we shoot some pool and take in an all-night movie?
You go, Fred.
I got something to do.
I'll come over and help you, and then we will go.
Honest, Fred, I can't go.
I'm writing a letter to Betty.
Gee, I sure miss her.
- Do you miss Wilma?
- Miss her?
Are you kidding?
She's only been gone two days.
Miss her?
Of course I miss her.
Fred, do you mind turning around?
This part is personal.
Sure, Barney.
Okay, Fred.
Thanks.
- Barney?
- Yeah?
I got an idea.
- Count me out, Fred.
- No, wait.
Supposing, now, just supposing we took a week of our vacations now and flew out to Hollyrock.
We could meet the girls and all come back together.
Right.
- Fred, I want to apologize.
- What for, Barney?
For what I've been thinking of you the last few days.
Third class, unscheduled, steerage flight now boarding at gate 13 for Hollyrock.
All aboard, you cheapskates.
That's us, Barney.
Let's go.
Hollyrock, here we come.
Gee, Betty.
This is where they make all those big television shows.
I know.
And aren't we lucky our prize included a trip through the studio?
And how.
Let's go in.
Problems.
Why do I always have these problems?
Why can't I get the right girl for the wife's part?
All I get is method actresses' mumbo jumbo starlets, simpering all over the place.
This part calls for a real woman.
A real wife.
One who's been through the wringer with a loud-mouthed, overbearing husband.
- Yes, sir.
- I can see her in my mind, you see.
She cries herself to sleep at night but she laughs and plays the game during the day, she Let's go to the commissary, Betty, and have a cool drink.
That's her.
She's perfect.
That's the answer.
Get that woman.
With her as the star, I can get The Frogmouth our big spectacular, into immediate production.
Here we are, sir.
There she is.
Hold it, don't move.
I was right.
That's her.
Yes, I believe you.
- I didn't say anything yet.
- I like that.
A sense of humor, too.
And that's what you need as the wife of the Frogmouth.
Frogmouth?
Watch it, bub.
Fred may be a little loud, but he's no frogmouth.
That's the spirit.
Defends her man in spite of everything.
What blind devotion to a no-good.
He beats you, he gambles the milk money.
You can't talk that way about Fred, you brute.
Use all that the fire, the intensity, she's perfect.
Only his name isn't Fred, you know, it's Bill.
Just my Bill kind of thing.
No matter what he does No matter where he goes It never rains on pretty flowers No, that's Jim, isn't it?
But if Fred articulates better, we'll change the name to Fred, you see.
Anything to get you to play the part.
What's he talking about, Wilma?
The part?
What part?
The wife part in our big TV spectacular, The Frogmouth.
Where did she go?
Come on, Wilma, wake up.
Somebody get a glass of water.
I can't believe it, Betty.
I'm in a television play.
Yeah, and a star part, too.
- Isn't it thrilling?
- It's like a dream.
Wait till Fred hears about this.
Gee, Wilma, we're having all the fun while our poor husbands are back home slaving away.
Yeah.
I wonder what Fred and Barney are doing now.
There she is, Barney.
Hollyrock.
Spread out at our feet.
Shouldn't we keep looking for Betty and Wilma, Fred?
Since they could be any place, they could be up here.
- But they're not up here, Fred.
- Okay.
We'll go back to Hollyrock Boulevard and keep looking for them.
Gee, Fred, we looked everywhere, but no Wilma and no Betty.
What'll we do now?
I don't know, Barney, but I gotta sit down somewhere.
My feet are killing me.
How about that place, Fred?
We can sit in there.
Get that title: The Frogmouth.
Must be about one of those loud-mouthed guys.
- You know the type, Barney.
- Intimately, Fred.
Anyway, we can watch them rehearse and rest at the same time.
- Feels good to sit down, Barney?
- Yeah.
I think I'll take a nap until the show starts.
That's a good idea.
A little snooze would do me a lot of good, too.
I know you've been rehearsing at home, and you know your part but project, you know, really give out.
You're the Frogmouth.
You're loud, you're noisy, you're obnoxious - Iots of decibels, you got it?
- I think so.
No, nobody would do this to me.
It's a gag, that's it.
It relieves the tension.
I was all tight.
Now I'm all loosened up.
Okay, Wilma, honey.
Throw the Frogmouth his first cue.
This is a rehearsal, everybody.
Quiet on the stage.
Go ahead, Wilma.
Bill, the baby's college fund money is missing.
Did you take it, Bill?
Yes, I did.
So what?
You wanna make something out of it?
No!
Louder, you're the Frogmouth.
Be positive.
Yes, I did.
So what?
You wanna make something out of it?
Why me?
I'm a good guy.
It's too late to audition people.
I could've gone to college, I could've learned a trade but, no, I had to be a television producer and I wind up with a polliwog for a frogmouth.
I'm ruined.
Hey, you guys, wake up.
Up.
This is a theater, not a flophouse.
Fred, look up on the stage.
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing up there?
I've been looking all over Hollyrock for you and what happens?
I find you up on a dark stage instead of outside, soaking up the sunshine.
That voice.
He's the perfect Frogmouth.
Get that frog, I mean that man.
Get him up here right away.
So, you're Wilma's husband.
I knew it.
One look at her, and I knew it.
Tell me, Fred, did you ever do any acting?
One year, I was in the spring play at Public School 158.
And you were a Hamlet, Romeo, King Arthur?
No, none of those things.
Some of the kids were trees some were flowers, some were butterflies.
- And what were you?
- I was a slug.
It figures.
And, now, Fred, you're going to have a chance to tromp the boards again, as the Frogmouth.
Fred and Wilma look good up there, don't they, Barney?
Here's the tryout.
Bill, the baby's college fund money is missing.
Did you take it?
Yes, I did.
So what?
If he wants to go to college he can wait on tables.
Stupendous!
Simply colossal.
Let me offer my congratulations.
You see, I love an actor who ad-libs lines to the script makes the show run long, you see.
We have to cut the ending, but I don't mind.
We never know how to end them anyway, you see.
You're in, Fred.
You'll be a smash.
Fred, how wonderful.
Congratulations.
I must live right no matter what my psychiatrist says.
I'm telling you, Barney, there's nothing to this acting racket.
It comes natural to me.
Of course, this Frogmouth bit is all right for a starter but it's not the real me.
I'm gonna move into big stuff, like Dr. Jekyll Hides.
The Halfback of Notre Dame.
Around the World in a Daze.
There's a lot of good things a man of my talents can tackle.
Mr. Flintstone, can I have your autograph please?
Certainly, son.
- Here you are, boy.
- Thanks, Fred.
You just signed the check for dinner.
Very funny.
The theater is packed.
Looks like everybody in Hollyrock has come to see the telecast.
Lucky for us we're friends of the stars.
We can watch it from backstage.
Look, Betty.
There's Fred and the producer.
He must be giving Fred some last-minute instructions.
You can run along now, J.B. I'll take over from here.
After all, I'm the star.
Hey, you up there!
Be sure and have that spotlight on me all the time.
And, Professor here's some music I wrote last night.
Use it to bridge into the second act.
Now, listen all you supporting players.
If you forget a line don't worry, I will cover for you.
I gotta stop him.
If the show goes over I'll be saddled with him for the whole season.
And I can't take that.
Not for 26 weeks.
I gotta stop him.
I gotta sabotage this thing.
But how?
Okay.
Places everybody.
Two minutes to go.
Turn the houselights down.
I got it.
It just might work.
How do you feel, Fred?
Are you nervous?
- Kind of sick to your stomach?
- Nervous?
Are you kidding?
You are talking to Mr. Showbiz, buster.
That's fine.
Because everybody will be watching every move you make.
Every line you speak, every lift of your eyebrow, they'll be rooting for you.
All 60 million of them.
60 million?
Okay, Wilma.
We're on the air.
Action!
Bill, the baby's college fund money is missing.
Did you take it?
Cut to camera three and bring Charlie in.
Okay, Charlie, you got an hour to fill in.
Keep those balls bouncing.
Remember, the show must go on.
Oh, boy.
My big chance.
Fred, what happened?
Say something.
Why, he's lost his voice.
- Hello, Wilma.
How's Fred feeling?
- Has he said anything yet?
No.
And we've been home for a week now.
I'm going to try that idea we thought up, Betty.
It's kind of drastic, but it might work.
How do you like my new fur coat?
It's genuine Siberian mastodon and only cost $5,000.
I knew you wouldn't mind, so I charged it.
Wilma!
Are you out of your mind?
You think I'm made of money or something?
Send it back before I sue the store for selling it to you.
Let's go home now, Barney.
Fred's got his voice back again.
And how.
The big frogmouth bellows again.
What a guy.
Yeah.
By the way, Barney when Wilma bought that fur coat the salesgirl showed me a darling little saber-toothed tiger stole.
I just couldn't resist it, Barney.
Betty Rubble!
Are you out of your mind?
Do you think I'm made of money or something?
Send it back before I sue the store for selling it to you.
What a loudmouth that guy is.
Oh, boy.
Come on, Wilma.
Open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- I'll murderlize you.
- It's my bucket.
Stop running, you insect.
Hiya, Fred.
Meet my new watchdog, Buzzsaw.
Your new watchdog?
Yeah, he's wonderful.
He instinctively knows when somebody don't like me.
Then he chases them.
Good dog.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Who was it?
- Barney.
- What does he want?
- He says you borrowed his watchdog.
He wants it back.
And here they come, ladies and gentlemen approaching the 18th tee.
The finalists.
: Ben Bowlder and Fred Flintstone.
It's been a nip and tuck battle all the way.
Fred Flintstone is still leading by two strokes.
The winner will get the trophy and be the champion of the annual tournament given by the Loyal Order of Dinosaurs.
All right.
It's Ben's honor, and he's ready to tee off.
A beautiful shot!
Right down the middle of the fairway.
Now here is a diagram of this 460-yard par- 4 hole and here is the distance traveled by Ben Bowlder's great tee shot putting him in perfect position for his second shot.
- Wilma.
- Hi, Betty.
- Are you listening to the tournament?
- I wouldn't dare not listen.
- Isn't it exciting?
- I hope Fred wins.
But I can take it or leave it.
If Fred wins I'll never hear the end of it.
Yeah.
And if Fred loses you'll never hear the end of it.
And here's Fred Flintstone.
Very cool.
He's got a tough shot to beat.
He hit that one real fat.
Here's Fred Flintstone set to tee off again.
And Fred's a little nervous.
Just a little.
He knows he has his work cut out for him.
Flintstone's hit a screaming line drive.
It looks like Flintstone's in trouble.
Back to the diagram for a look at the path of this ridiculous Impossible shot.
This is a big decision for Fred Flintstone.
The question is.
: Should he take a penalty stroke, or should he How about that?
Flintstone is going to play it where it lies.
We have just seen the greatest shot ever made.
The ball's heading straight for the green and passed right over it.
Too bad.
More hard luck for Fred Flintstone.
A lot depends on Ben Bowlder's next shot.
And it's a beauty.
Fred Flintstone needs a miracle to pull this game out of the fire.
And he's going to give it that old college try.
One thing about Flintstone, he's a fighter who doesn't know the meaning of the word "quit".
This is a tense moment, folks.
Fore!
It's in.
- He won!
- Hurray for Fred!
Ladies and gentlemen.
Listen.
Nothing like this has ever happened before.
A sensational finish.
Fred Flintstone, the new champion, is walking towards the chairman of the tournament committee to receive the cup.
They've never had a more deserving champion.
Wait a minute.
Something's up.
Barney Rubble, President of the lodge apparently wants to take the cup away from Fred Flintstone.
- Don't tell me they're at it again?
- They've never quit.
This is unbelievable.
They're struggling over the cup.
Let's ask one of the other members what this is about.
You, sir.
- Who me?
- Could you tell us what this is all about?
It all goes back to a meeting, a month ago when the lodge was holding its annual election of officers.
We will now proceed with the election of a president.
You will all vote for either Fred Flintstone or Barney Rubble.
- Mr. Chairman.
- What is it, Brother Flintstone?
As you know I've been lodge president three times, and although I'm greatly honored I would like to withdraw and move that Barney Rubble be elected unanimously.
Me?
Second the motion.
Speech!
Come on, pal, speak.
Gee, this is the greatest day of my life.
What an honor.
And the man I have to thank for it is Fred Flintstone my bosom buddy, close friend, and lifelong pal.
Oh, Barney.
Cut it out.
I promise to be a good president and put the lodge back on its feet financially.
There's only one way to do it.
By collecting back dues.
And believe me, that's what I'm going to do.
That's the way to do it, Prez.
Three cheers for Barney Rubble!
That's what led up to the fuss taking place between Fred and Barney now.
You mean it has something to do with back dues?
You get the picture.
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.
What's the big idea trying to take my cup?
- I won the tournament.
- And that makes no difference.
It says in the bylaw, section 42: "No member shall be entitled to receive a trophy "unless his dues are paid up to date".
I'm only a month overdue.
That makes no difference.
A month is a month.
And a thankless friend is a thankless friend.
Any lodge you're a member of I don't want any part of.
And that goes for the cup, too.
Rules are rules.
No dues, no trophy.
My pointy head.
What about Fred?
Is he still on the rampage?
Worse then ever.
Barney's name can't be mentioned in our house.
- Not only that - Wilma.
I would like to speak to you.
I see what you mean.
But it can't last forever.
- Now listen, Fred.
- You listen to me.
Barney Rubble is my enemy.
Betty is married to him.
- That makes her my enemy.
And - Oh, Fred.
I don't want you talking to the enemy.
Hi, Wilma.
What's new on the Western Front?
The General has had a setback.
He wants to move, but he can't find a house he can afford.
Barney's starting to get a little steamed up, too.
He might just as well blow a gasket.
I have to deliver an ultimatum.
Ultimatum who?
Fred wants everything back that, quote "That no-good scrounger has borrowed over the years," unquote.
- Come on in and help yourself.
- Do I need a flag of truce?
- That you, Wilma?
- Yes, Fred.
- Where's all the stuff?
- Here's all the stuff.
You mean that can opener - is all the stuff he borrowed?
- Yes.
- Did you look in the attic?
- Yes.
- In the garage?
- Yes.
- In the cellar?
- Yes.
The sneak.
He must have buried everything else.
That's the answer.
I like the food over at the Rubbles' better.
- Fred.
- Yeah?
Barney wants all his stuff back.
He does, does he?
You can tell him from me Any sign yet?
Is Fred bringing back my stuff?
I don't see anything.
Not a creature is stirring.
Not even a fat mouse like Fred Flintstone?
Hold it, here comes a message.
- What does it say?
- Don't rush me.
It says: "Dear Betty, Fred says "that if Barney sets foot on Fred's property "he'll cool him".
It doesn't make sense.
No, wait a minute.
Not he'll cool him.
"He'll kill him".
Sure.
That makes sense.
- He's not scaring me.
- Now, Barney.
What's mine is mine, and I intend to get it.
Will you relax, Betty?
He won't lay a hand on me.
I'm too fast, and he's too fat.
Barney, be careful.
Don't worry, but check and see if I paid my last insurance premium.
Just in case, you know.
There's my bucket.
And just where are you going with my property?
Your property?
This is my bucket.
You're overlooking one little detail.
The water in that bucket happens to belong to me.
I'm sorry, Fred.
Here you are.
- I'll murderlize you.
- It's my bucket.
Stop running, you insect.
Hiya, Fred.
Meet my new watchdog, Buzzsaw.
Your new watchdog?
Yeah, he's wonderful.
He instinctively knows when somebody don't like me.
Then he chases them.
Good dog.
Good dog.
Let's see.
"V-E-T".
- "Veterinarian".
- Will you hurry up, Wilma?
Here it is.
Hello?
Yes.
Okay, I'll tell him.
- Who was it?
- Barney.
- What does he want?
- He says you borrowed his watchdog.
He wants it back.
- Fred?
- Yeah?
Why don't you pay your back dues?
Then you could get your cup, we could sign a peace treaty with the Rubbles and live more neighborly ever after.
Peace treaty?
Just when I'm planning a counterattack?
Okay, it was just an idea.
I see some more of my property.
Let's see.
Maybe I can turn the hose on him tonight while he's sleeping.
So sorry, my ball.
Deuced nuisance, but my club, you know.
Tee, too.
I'll beat a tee, too, on your head, if I ever get you.
Good dog.
Will you try being friendly just for me?
Go over and give Fred the cup.
Then ask him in a nice way to give you the dues he owes.
I'll try it, but you know Fred, it won't work.
I just know it'll work.
Fred's really sentimental.
When he sees the cup, he'll soften up.
And when Barney goes into that "Close friend, bosom buddy, lifelong pal" Fred will break down and cry.
In fact, Barney will break down and cry, too, if I know him.
They're a couple of sentimental guys.
They really love each other.
That you, Barney?
I told you it wouldn't work.
The nerve of that little molecule.
Knocks on my door and says: "Give me the dues, you cheapskate, or you don't get the cup".
He got the cup all right.
Yeah?
- What do you want?
- My hammock.
What else?
That's as far as you go, buster.
I am going to tell you once and only once.
- Let go of that hammock.
- Okay.
Fred!
What are you doing in the refrigerator?
Never mind.
Pass me the salt.
Hi, Betty.
No, no break in the cold war yet.
In fact, it's getting a little chillier.
I don't believe it.
He called the Missing Link Fence Company and ordered a solid fence 40 feet long and 80 feet high?
What did they say?
They told him what it would cost, and he said, "Forget it".
Then he went out to get an estimate on a moat.
Here he comes.
Bye.
- You home, Wilma?
- Right here, Fred.
- What's all that stuff?
- I'm throwing a little party.
I'm glad to hear we're having some fun around here for a change.
Who's coming?
- Just a few of the boys.
- Boys?
Like who?
Like Joe Rockhead.
Joe Rockhead!
That loudmouth?
You hate him.
I know, but he's just right for the party.
- Who else?
- Malcolm Quartz.
That big showoff?
The last time he was here, he broke a lamp.
He's just right for the party.
- And who else?
- Eddie, Sam, Pete.
And you know the one who likes to dance with you all the time?
I know him well.
Left-foot Charlie.
What's the matter?
Did they close the pool hall?
Droll, very droll.
But I'll ignore it.
For your information this party's going to be like Mardi Gras and New Year's Eve.
- I don't get it.
- Simple.
You know how Rubble loves parties.
When he hears the racket and smells that steak barbecuing he'll go out of his mind.
- That'll make two of us.
- He'll be sorry he ever started up with me.
Come on, let's get the party on the road.
Start making sandwiches.
All right, fellows, all together.
What the matter with Flintstone?
He's all right A little louder.
I want Rubble to hear it.
Hey, Fred.
You sure know how to throw a party.
Thanks, Charlie.
Having a good time, Wilma?
Yippee.
I'll change the record for you.
Come on, let's keep this party going.
Attaboy, Fred.
Hold it, Mac.
Thanks.
Don't mention it.
How's that, Charlie?
Great, Fred.
I love waltzes.
Yeah.
So does Wilma.
Yuck.
What do you say, Eddie, is that charcoal ready?
Red-hot and ready, Freddie.
Okay, you guys, drop that dinosaur steak on the grill.
One top sirloin for ten, coming up.
Boy, wait till Barney gets a whiff of that beauty barbecuing.
Blow some smoke over in Barney's direction.
Right, Fred.
It's costing me plenty to make that little shrimp's mouth water.
But it's worth it.
Come on, let's change the music and start things up.
Look at that Charlie.
What a dancer.
Charlie can dance to anything.
But don't forget, it takes two to tango and Wilma's the greatest.
- Excuse me.
- Sure.
Hello?
You'll have to talk a little louder.
Oh, hello.
Sure.
I'll take care of it.
Bye.
- Who was it, Wilma?
- It was Betty.
Oh, yeah?
I suppose Barney's begging to come to the party.
He can beg all he wants to.
He can beg on his hands and knees.
I'm not inviting him.
Betty just wanted me to leave a note for the milkman - not to bring anything till Monday.
- He can beg standing on his head Monday?
What do you mean Monday?
The Rubbles are away for the weekend.
- You mean that sneak's not home?
- Nope.
- He's not smelling that steak?
- Nope.
- He's not hearing this party?
- Nope.
What's the matter with Flintstone?
He's all right Hold it.
Hold it, please, will you, fellows?
Thank you.
I interrupt this party for a special announcement.
Good old Fred.
What a host.
- What's the announcement, Fred?
- Get out!
Out, you freeloaders.
Out!
All of you.
O-W-T, out!
I think it's a great idea.
The only thing that worries me is if they find out that we did it.
I can't take another week of this.
I'll try anything.
Okay, let's put Operation Buddy-Buddy into work.
It better work or we're dead.
Betty.
- I'm in here, Barney.
- Fred finally gave up.
What do you mean?
He paid up his back dues, and he's a member of good standing again.
Well, isn't that nice?
But you know something, Barney?
When you see Fred, I wouldn't mention anything about it.
Sure, I get it.
You know me.
- Tactful, diplomatic.
- And president of the lodge.
Yeah.
- Wilma.
- Yes, Fred?
Ta-da!
Fred!
You got the cup.
How did it happen?
They just handed me the cup and didn't say a word about the dues.
- But I know it's Barney's doing.
- Barney?
Sure, the poor little guy.
He knows he can't get along without me.
President of the lodge, without me to advise him.
He had to get me back.
I'll bet he talked them into giving me an honorary membership.
Don't mention anything about it when you see him.
You know what I mean?
Sure, I know what you mean.
You know me.
- Tactful, diplomatic.
- And you got the cup.
Yeah.
Ain't it a beauty?
You know, I think I'll show Barney how a big man behaves.
- I'll go over and see him.
- I'll go with you.
- But remember - Don't worry.
Not a word.
Brother Barney, how are things at the lodge?
Could be better, Brother Fred.
Yes, I know, but I'll give you a hand.
Say, I'm glad to see the cup on your mantel where it belongs.
Right, with the champ.
Where else, Brother Rubble?
Naturally, if I had played, I'd have beat your brains out, Brother Flintstone.
- You?
Beat me at golf?
- With one hand tied behind my back.
You put your golf clubs where your mouth is.
Anytime.
And after I beat you at golf, I'll give you a bowling lesson.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
And then I'll beat you at pool.
- Is that so?
- Yeah, that's so.
Listen to them fighting.
Yeah.
Thank goodness they're friends again.
Wilma!
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Here's the ticket, safe and sound.
I don't blame Fred for getting nervous after what happened.
Barney!
What in the world are you doing up on that stool?
Stool?
Yeah.
I saw a mouse.
- Hiya, Joe.
- Hiya, Barney.
- Hello, Mrs. Roxy, how's Junior?
- Just fine, Mr. Rubble.
Cute little pup you got there.
"My mother told me to take this one" Looks like a winner, Flintstone.
- Fred, what are you doing?
- Hiya, Barney.
- You're just in time.
- In time for what, Fred?
In time to buy a sweepstake ticket from Charlie.
You're lucky.
I only got one left.
I'll take it.
Will you lend me the price of a ticket?
I'm kind of short this week.
Me, too.
I only had enough for my own ticket.
Charlie, could you wait till next week for the money?
Sorry, men.
No money, no ticket.
I can't sell on credit.
Tough luck, Barney.
You might have won a fortune.
Yeah.
You know, I'm pretty lucky that way.
Remember when I won that set of dishes at the club raffle?
Yeah.
I remember you dropped them all as soon as you left the club.
Wasn't that lucky?
I could have dropped them after I got home.
Very funny.
Anyway, I hope you win, Fred.
You deserve it.
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
I always said, "Fred is the salt of the earth.
"Generous, kind, unselfish "ready to give you the shirt off his back".
Yep.
It couldn't happen to a nicer unselfish friend.
Can you beat that?
What a sweet little guy.
That Barney is a real pal.
You bet your life he's a real pal.
You know what you are?
You're a schnook.
- A schnook?
- Yes, a schnook.
All right.
So you didn't have the money but you could have offered to split your ticket with him.
Yeah, that's what I'll do, I'll split it with him.
What's the matter?
You nuts?
You wanna give away half your winnings?
Don't be a sucker.
Winnings.
What are winnings without friends?
Money can't buy happiness.
A rich man is a sad man.
Take my wealth.
Just let me share a crust of bread with a true friend and that's all I ask.
How sickening can you get?
Yeah, I'll show Barney that I can be a sweet guy, too.
- Barney.
- Hello, Fred.
You gonna let me buy half the ticket?
You gonna let me?
How about it?
Now, how did you know that?
I figured you would, you know, being such a swell guy.
- Let me see our ticket, Fred.
- Okay.
You're in for half, Barney.
- This ticket's got my lucky number.
- Yeah, what is it?
"2, 7, 3, 4, 9, 0, 8, 1, 1, 7 "5, 3, 3, 2, 9, 0, 9 "8, 1, 0, 0.
Series H." - That is your lucky number?
- Yeah.
Ain't it a coincidence?
Mercy me, I can't see how we could lose.
Lucky number.
Let me have that ticket.
No, Fred, I better hold it.
It's my lucky number.
You might jinx it.
I'll jinx you good if you don't let me have that ticket.
- Now give me it.
- But, Fred, Wilma will find it.
You know what happened last year.
Yeah, she started charging things all over town.
Right, and you were six months trying to pay it off, remember?
Besides, I have the perfect hiding place for it.
Yeah, where?
I can't tell you, Fred.
You talk in your sleep and Wilma would find out and she'd tell Betty and they'd both run down to the store yelling, "Charge it".
Okay, Barney, maybe you're right.
- You hide it.
- Right, Fred.
See you later, and good luck, partner.
You know, sometimes I wish I wasn't such a sweet guy.
What the heck, the pay is good.
Hiya, Wilma, I'm home.
What are you up to, Fred?
You're keeping something from me.
I know you, Fred Flintstone, you've got something secret going on.
Now what is it?
I walked to the corner, turned, and walked back.
What's so cloak-and-dagger about that?
What kind of secret could I get from here to Schultz's delicatessen?
I don't know, Fred, but something's going on.
Guilt is written all over your face.
Boy.
How do they do it?
They must have x-ray eyes.
Read a guy's mind right through his skull.
"Guilt is written all over your face".
What an imagination.
I don't believe it.
I'll hide the ticket in the lining of this old suit.
Betty will never find it.
Haven't worn it for years.
Hello, Betty.
What's going on, Barney, what are you up to?
- Up to?
- You're acting funny.
I was straightening up my closet, what's funny about that?
Straightening up your closet?
That's the funniest thing I've heard today.
You haven't straightened up that goat's nest since we moved here.
Look at it: Old golf clubs, water skis, cracked bowling ball broken fishing pole, paint pails, and all those old clothes.
I've a good mind to throw it all out before the Board of Health quarantines us.
Now, wait a minute.
That's my closet.
That stuff might come in handy someday.
It sure will, when we open a junkyard.
I don't get it.
I go to this closet thousands of times, no Betty.
I hide something in it once And, whammo, there she is.
When a guy puts a wedding ring on his wife's finger it turns on a radar that reads a guy's mind.
No wonder they never take their wedding rings off.
- Betty, are you home?
- Hi, Wilma.
I'm in the kitchen.
Where's Barney?
I think he went over to your house to see Fred.
- Did you get the ticket?
- Yep, here it is.
And believe me, we were lucky.
This is the last sweepstake ticket in town.
Let me have it, Wilma.
I'll hide it before Barney and Fred get their little hot hands on it.
- How about hiding it under the sofa?
- No.
Sometimes Barney takes a nap under there.
I've got a better place.
I'll put it in this old coffee pot.
He doesn't even know there's a shelf here, much less a coffee pot.
Now remember, Wilma, not a word about this to the boys.
Don't worry.
I know those two.
If they knew we had a sweepstake ticket first thing they'd do is rush out to the store and buy everything in sight.
Silly things.
Like new bowling balls, sport cars, or something ridiculous.
Right, nothing sensible like a new wardrobe for us.
Say, speaking about wardrobes all the stores are having a summer sale today on their new fall clothes.
And our ticket might win.
- I was thinking the same thing.
- What are we waiting for?
Charge it!
You expecting company, Betty?
I'll go see who it is.
- Yes, what is it?
- Pardon me, my little lady.
My hobby is collecting handouts: Old clothes, bottles money, small change.
Anything you may wish to dispose of.
Wait a minute, I'll see.
- Who is it, Betty?
- Some poor old fellow down on his luck.
I'll see what Barney's got in that closet of his.
This ought to do.
Barney hasn't worn this thing for years.
He'll never miss it.
Thank you, lady.
Your generosity is appreciated.
Okay, Betty, you did your good deed for the day.
Now let's do something nice for ourselves.
I'm with you.
Charge it!
Boy, when our ticket wins we'll do big things, Barney.
And how.
We'll treat the bowling team to a free game.
Yeah, we'll have a pizza-pie spread for the whole gang.
Look, Fred, there's Wilma and Betty.
I wonder where they're going.
Charge it!
Does that answer your question?
Betty must have found our sweepstake ticket.
Impossible, Fred.
That ticket is hidden where nobody can find it.
Absolutely nobody.
What's the matter, Barney, you sick or something?
You look green.
Excuse me, Fred, I'll be right back.
I got to check up on something.
No.
After him, Fred.
That old guy that just passed by.
He has our sweepstake ticket in the pocket.
- You!
Stop, come back here!
- That's my jacket.
You knucklehead.
The ticket's hidden where no one will find it?
Hold it, mister!
Okay, pop, off with the coat.
Stand back or I'll clobber you with this cane.
- Where did you get that coat?
- Make one false move and I'll beat a tattoo on your noggin.
Okay, you can keep the coat, pop.
All we want is the ticket.
Here's a one-way ticket to Lumpsville.
Take that.
And that.
Help, police!
Hold him, Fred, while I take the coat off.
Two against one.
I have seen enough, let's go.
It's only fair to warn you I've studied judo.
- Relax, pop, all we want is the ticket.
- Yeah, you can have the coat.
Put that old man down.
- He hit us first.
- It's not like it looks, Officer.
It never is.
Hello.
It's you, Fred.
I've been looking all over for you.
Where are you?
The police station?
Yeah, and Barney's with me.
Now listen, get ahold of Betty and come right down here.
She can clear up the whole thing.
Search me, Betty.
All I know is they're in on an 803 and that you can clear it up.
- What's an 803?
- Attacking an old man with his own cane.
Even Perry Masonary couldn't clear that up.
And that's the way it happened, sir.
Barney didn't know I'd given his coat to that nice old man.
Okay, lady, I'll let him go.
But let this be a lesson to you.
A man's closet should be sacred.
What looks like junk to a wife may have great sentimental value to a husband.
Last year, my wife threw out a pair of sneakers I had for 16 years.
But for the children's sake we're back together again.
Al, release the prisoners.
Men, they sure stick together.
Barney, I didn't get a chance to ask you on the way home did you get the ticket out of the coat - before the cops took us in?
- I sure did, partner.
Good, bring it over to my house, I'll take care of it from now on.
That ain't necessary, Fred.
I've got it hidden where no one will find it.
Yeah?
That's what you said before, only Betty almost gave it away.
Don't worry, partner, she won't find it this time.
Trust me.
Betty would never think of looking in that old cookie jar.
It's too obvious.
But I better check it to make sure.
Here's the ticket, safe and sound.
I don't blame Fred for getting nervous after what happened.
Barney!
What in the world are you doing up on that stool?
Stool?
Yeah.
I saw a mouse.
Get down from there and stop your nonsense.
Dinner's ready.
Okay, dear.
I wonder.
It's here all right.
For a minute I thought he found our ticket.
Flintstone, wake up.
- Hello, sucker.
- Sucker?
You buy a sweepstake ticket and you haven't seen hide nor hair of it since.
In my book that makes you a sucker.
Hasn't it dawned on you that your partner, Barney might have some gimmick going where he'll cop all the dough?
Don't listen to him, Frederick.
You know Barney is honest and trustworthy.
- You must have dignity.
- Dignity, shmignity!
That's out where money is concerned.
And as far as you're concerned you're out, too.
Now listen before that goody-goody guy comes back.
You want to hold that ticket for a while, don't you, to protect your interest?
You bet.
Betty and Barney are asleep.
So sneak over there and get it.
Sneak over and get it.
But suppose they see me?
How could I explain that?
Easy.
Just make believe you're walking in your sleep.
Capisce?
Yeah, I capisce.
And I should be the one to hold it anyway.
Now you're talking.
I hope she don't wake up.
Fred?
- Quick, stupid, into your sleepwalking act.
- Yeah.
No.
Not that sleepwalking act again.
Every time he goes on a diet he uses that routine to sneak a snack.
Why fight it?
- Good night, Fred.
- Good night, Wilma.
It worked.
Now hurry up, get the ladder out of the garage and get going.
Now what's the matter?
I feel like a big fat crook, that's what.
So you're fat.
Does that mean you're dishonest?
After all, you're stealing what was yours in the first place.
- Yeah, you're right.
- So get going already.
I hate to do this, but it's for his own good.
Can't you do anything wrong right?
What happened?
- Somebody pushed the ladder.
- Yeah, and I know who.
Wait here.
Oh, me.
Oh, my.
Scram!
Okay, the coast is clear.
No, Frederick, don't do it.
If you set one foot in that house you'll be sorry.
Don't listen to him.
You know good guys never win.
And if you know what's good for you, you'll blow.
Yeah, like he says: Blow.
Attaboy, let your conscience be your guide.
- Your bad conscience.
Get it?
- Yeah.
Good.
They're still asleep.
Now, where would a guy like Barney keep a sweepstakes ticket?
Let's see.
I'll look under his pillow first.
Go to sleep Go to sleep Close your big, bloodshot eyes Go to sleep Good night, Mommy.
Mommy?
Ain't that a kick in the head?
Good night, son, but first tell Mommy where you hid the sweepstakes ticket.
It's in the kitchen, up on the shelf, above the stove.
Now kiss little Barney good night, Mommy.
Okay, son, here's a kiss for you.
He must have meant that old coffee pot.
I'll take a look in there first.
Hot dog, I found it.
You'll be safe with me, baby.
Barney will thank me for it when we win.
Wilma.
Hi, Betty, what's up?
They're going to announce the sweepstakes winner on the radio.
- Come on over.
- I'll be right there, Betty.
Boy, we cannot lose All I got to say is you're the lucky number You're the lucky number We cannot lose, you're the lucky number et cetera, et cetera, number What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
But whatever it is I don't like it.
Let's just get our ticket, and I'll feel better.
- It's gone!
Our ticket is gone!
- Gone?
- Do you think it was Barney?
- I don't have to think.
I'm sure of it.
Look, Betty, isn't that a sweepstake ticket?
Barney Rubble, where did you get that ticket?
What difference does it make?
If we win we'll split.
- You'll get your share.
- We'll get our share?
What nerve.
Hold it, girls, here comes the announcement.
And here's the winning number on the sweepstakes, folks.
It's number: 2, 7, 3, 4, 9 0, 8, 1, 1, 7, 5 3, 3, 2 9, 0, 9, 8, 1, 0, 0.
Series X. Series X?
We didn't win.
Barney!
We hit it, we won!
We got the winning ticket, you were right.
It was your lucky number!
Congratulate us, girls Barney and I just won the sweepstakes!
But, Fred, where did you get the ticket?
Where did I get it?
Just where you hid it, Barney-boy right under the coffee pot on the shelf over the stove.
Coffee pot.
Why, that's our ticket!
There were two tickets.
No offense, Barney, but I just wanted to make sure it was safe.
Which reminds me, Wilma my pal Barney and I are going to run the finances around here and we don't want to see you girls run off on any big spending spree.
Right, partner?
And here's the big news about the sweepstake winner, folks.
Two local people, living right here in Bedrock - share the winning ticket.
- That's us, Barney-pal.
Congratulations to Mrs. Fred Flintstone and Mrs. Barney Rubble.
Mrs. What's he talking about?
There must be some mistake.
Yeah, Fred, and you made it.
You took the wrong ticket.
Thanks for minding our ticket.
- We'll see you later, boys.
- Yeah, much later.
Charge it!
- Fred?
- Yeah, Barney.
Whatever made you do such a thing, Fred?
Some guy gave me a bum steer but I'll never listen to him again.
Never.
- Hi, pal.
- You again?
Yeah, listen, why don't you go downtown and get a new bowling ball before Wilma spends all that dough?
Barney, how about getting a new fishing pole before Betty runs out of loot?
- Fred, I just thought of a good idea.
- Say no more, Barney.
I just got the same idea.
Let's go.
Charge it!
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, Fred, I'm getting the hang of this.
Watch.
That's pretty good flipping, pal.
Keep up the good work.
Hey, now watch this.
A double somersault flip-over.
I'm sorry, Fred.
Watch it, fathead.
Okay, where is it, Wilma?
- Where is what, Fred?
- My dinner.
When I sit down, I want it and me to hit the wire in a photo finish.
I'll photo-finish you, Fred if you don't wash those hands before you sit down at the table.
And while you're at it, wash your face, too.
All right, you just get my dinner ready.
This isn't home anymore.
It's a waterhole where the animals come to devour their kill.
"Wash your hands.
"Wash your face.
Wash behind your ears.
Put it back".
Now that you've eaten, Fred, and you're in a good mood what's troubling you?
It's my job.
I'm sick and tired of it.
Who isn't tired of their job?
Do you think I like my setup?
Cooking, cleaning, washing all day.
Never get to go anywhere.
Why, the last time we went out together was when the drapes caught on fire.
Oh, honey.
I'm sorry, Wilma.
I know you work hard.
I admit you deserve better.
And someday, I'm going to see to it that you get what you deserve.
Really, Fred, I'm not complaining.
I married you for better or for worse and some day that better will come along.
Now, why don't you forget it and go visit Barney.
Okay, dear, I will.
- Hi, Fred, come in.
- Hi, Betty.
Is Barney home?
I'm in the den, Fred, reading the papers.
Checking on the rock market, Barney?
I was just glancing through the want-ad section.
Are you looking for a job?
I am getting tired of the rut I'm in.
No kidding?
You, too?
- What do you mean, Fred?
- I'll tell you something, Barney.
As long as we work for someone else, we'll stay in a rut.
The only way to make it is to have our own business.
Sure, but what do we know about running businesses?
Are you kidding?
We've got the most important asset right now.
Brains.
We got it up here.
Granted.
But what business can we get into?
Not what business, but which business are we best suited for?
Offhand, Barney what would you say I do best?
That's easy, Fred.
You can stow away more food than anybody I know.
That's it.
You hit the nail on the head.
- What did I say, Fred?
- Enough to give me a brilliant idea.
Barney, you and me are going into the restaurant business.
The restaurant What's the matter with you?
You don't want the girls to know about it yet.
- Where are we going, Fred?
- To get a restaurant, that's where.
But we don't know nothing about restaurants.
You said yourself, I know food.
Sure.
And I can tell time, but I can't make a watch.
But suppose we fail, Fred?
Fail?
That is negative thinking again, Barney.
You've got to think positively.
You get it?
Positively.
Right, Fred.
We will positively fail.
What a partner.
So you want to go in business for yourself?
Yes, sir.
Sure you won't settle for a paper route?
- We had a restaurant in mind.
- Yeah, have you got one for sale?
Yeah, but you'd be surprised how many places insist on some cash changing hands.
Complicates it when you two are broke.
Say, wait a minute.
This might be it.
A drive-in restaurant.
No cash, no down payment, just notes to sign.
We'll take it.
Where do we sign?
No, just a minute, Fred.
Let's not be hasty.
Tell us a little about it.
I'll be perfectly honest.
The place failed once.
But only because the owner lacked personality.
Now, you two are different.
The minute you walked in, I said to myself: "Those boys are full of personality".
Could we see it first?
Say, that little partner of yours is no fool.
He's all business.
What a perfect combination.
One, all personality.
And the other, all business.
Tell you what, we'll go see it right now.
You guys wait outside for a minute while I make an urgent business call.
- Hello, Al?
- Yes?
I got a couple of live ones for your drive-in.
Yeah, put some of your used cars around it.
We're coming out right away.
There she is, boys.
Notice the cars?
And that's with the place closed.
Imagine what will happen when you open up.
- Boy!
- Oh, boy!
- Partner, we got the business.
- Yeah, I'm sure we did.
We got lots to do, Barney-boy.
Buy food, hire waitresses, get ready for the grand opening.
But we'd better not tell Wilma and Betty about this for a while, Fred.
You're right, Barney.
Some wives don't understand a guy quitting his job.
- Right, that's the kind I got.
- Me, too.
We'll keep our mouths shut.
Guess what, Gwendolyn?
The Drive Inn is opening up again.
Oh, goody.
Maybe we can get our old jobs back again.
My boyfriend, Eddie, gave me the new owner's telephone number.
A guy named Fred.
Let's call him up right away and let him know the world's best car hops are available.
Hello?
Who?
Yes, there's a Fred living here, but he isn't home right now.
We heard he's going to need a couple of girls.
Who, Fred?
I want to tell him my friend and I are a couple of live wires.
I'm sure you are.
Thanks, honey.
We'll call him back later.
Live wires.
When I get through with Fred, there'll be no place for a live wire to hook on to.
Hi, Wilma, baby.
Lover-boy is home.
I've got something to discuss with you.
Not now, honey.
I've got a couple of important things on my mind.
That's exactly what I want to discuss.
Okay, but I deny all charges till I know what they are.
It's your dime.
Start talking.
This is Fred.
A couple of live what?
A couple of live wires.
Me and Gwendolyn are the best drive-in waitresses in town.
Oh, boy.
- He said, "Oh, boy".
- Good.
Keep talking.
Look, Charlie, I don't want any raffle tickets.
Besides, what would I do with a big dinosaur if I won?
I don't understand him.
You talk to him, Gwendolyn.
Who's this now?
Irving.
No, Irv, I just explained it all to Charlie.
Goodbye.
- He hung up.
- It must've been a bad connection.
Let's go see him, personal-like.
Who was that, Fred?
- You mean on the phone?
- Yes, I mean on the phone.
That was Charlie and Irving.
Was it two girls that called?
- Girls?
- Yes, girls.
They wear dresses, long hair, perfume.
You must've noticed them.
- There are lots of them around.
- Now, look here, Wilma I don't know what girls you're talking about, and that's the truth.
By the way, Barney I had a couple of strange phone calls today.
First there was a butcher.
He wanted to know if you were interested in two tons of dinosaur burgers.
And then some man named Eddie called.
He said two girls are interested in seeing you.
What girls, Barney?
That's crazy.
What girls would be interested in me?
I'm interested in you.
What does that make me, chopped liver?
Honest, Betty.
I don't know what it's all about.
It sounds mighty suspicious to me.
Come on, Fred, stop sulking.
I'm sorry I mistook Charlie and Irving for girls.
It's the principle of the thing.
If we don't trust each other, we got nothing.
I do trust you, Fred.
And I won't mention it again.
That must be Barney.
Maybe he can get you out of this mood.
Hello, honey.
Is Fred in?
We're the girls who called earlier, remember?
- Who is it, Wilma?
- It's Charlie and Irving.
And they've got their raffle tickets with them.
Come in, fellas.
Here we come on the run With a burger on a bun And a dab of coleslaw on the side Oh, your taste we will tickle With a cold dill pickle And all of our potatoes are French-fried, fried, fried Our burgers can't be beat 'Cause we grind our own meat Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind When you drive away A tip upon our tray We hope to find, find, find, find, find We hope to find, find, find, find, find Yeah, I know.
You never saw them before in your life.
Here we come on the run With a burger on a bun They're at Barney's.
Come on, Fred.
We are going to get to the bottom of this.
And all of our potatoes are French-fried, fried, fried Our burgers can't be beat 'Cause we grind our own meat Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind When you drive away A tip upon our tray We hope to find, find, find, find, find We hope to find, find, find, find, find Barney-boy, you are a genius.
You sure got us out of a jam last night.
Convincing our wives we were auditioning waitresses for our annual club dinner will go down in history with the invention of the bow and arrow.
It was really nothing.
I just happened to think of it.
With brains like that, Barney-boy, our business can't miss.
I feel so ashamed about last night, Betty.
Jumping to conclusions about those girls was unfair.
Yeah, Fred and Barney are real good guys.
Never miss a day's work, bring home their paychecks regularly.
You're right.
I think I'll call Fred and apologize again.
- Why don't you?
He'd like that.
- I will.
Hello, may I speak to Fred Flintstone, please?
He what?
When?
I see.
Well, thank you.
What did the old darling do, Wilma?
The old darling, steady Freddie, has quit his job.
What?
I'll call Barney.
He'll know what happened.
Hello, may I speak to Barney Rubble, please?
Are you sure?
Thank you.
Barney has quit his job, too.
Are you kidding?
Two pounds of dinosaur meat for burgers?
- The minimum order is two tons.
- Two tons?
Of course.
You're in the restaurant business now.
And to get it for a price, you got to take three tons of parsley.
- Three tons of parsley?
- What do we do with it?
What every restaurant does: You put some parsley on each order so the customers can throw it away.
What's the matter with you guys?
It's been going on for years.
Okay, we'll take two tons of dinosaur meat.
Yeah, and three tons of parsley to throw away.
Here we come on the run With a burger on a bun And a dab of coleslaw on the side Oh, your taste we will tickle With a cold dill pickle And all of our potatoes are French-fried, fried, fried Our burgers can't be beat 'Cause we grind our own meat Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind Oh, no!
- They're not in the pool hall, Betty.
- Let's try the bowling alley.
I'm telling you, when I find that Barney he's sure going to have a lot of explaining to do.
Hey, Fred, I'm getting the hang of this.
Watch.
That's pretty good flipping, pal.
Keep up the good work.
Hey, now watch this.
A double somersault flip-over.
I'm sorry, Fred.
Watch it, fathead.
- They're not in here.
- Let's try the ball park next.
One order of barbecued ribs, Fred.
- Right.
One order of ribs, Barney.
- Right.
Boy, here come the ribs.
Don't they look delicious?
Barbecued ribs coming up.
- Will there be anything else, sir?
- Yeah, two cups of coffee.
Two cups of coffee, Fred.
And, miss, bring the ketchup, too.
One fried-egg sand.
- Barney, where is the hotcakes?
- They keep disappearing.
Give me that thing.
Hotcakes just don't disappear.
- See what I mean?
- Quiet, you bonehead.
There's a bird up there knocking off our hotcakes.
- What are you going to do?
- Use this rock.
It's his puny bird brain against mine.
Watch this, Barn.
They'll call that bird "Rock Bottom" from now on.
I give up, Betty.
We've looked everywhere.
- Do you suppose they left town?
- It's possible.
Fred is so sensitive.
And I made all those false accusations.
You're right.
And Barney must've gone with him.
Poor Fred.
He's so used to home-cooking, too.
Which reminds me, we haven't had a thing to eat all day.
- How about grabbing a sandwich?
- Okay.
There's a drive-in on the next corner.
Get that, will you, Gwen?
My feet are killing me.
Sure, Daisy.
What will it be, ladies?
- Just a coconut shake for me.
- And I'll have some pterodactyl tea.
A shake and tea.
Betty, look at our waitress.
It's Charlie.
And there's Irving.
Wilma, under the chef's hat.
Anyone you know?
Fred!
And look who's making the shake.
One coconut shake coming up.
It's Barney.
Here's your order, girls.
Who had the coconut shake?
Charlie, I mean, miss, do you remember us?
Yeah, sure.
You're the wives of the new owners.
That's right.
And I wonder if you'd do us a favor.
Sure.
We'd like to borrow your uniforms to play a joke on our husbands.
Certainly.
In fact, you can have them.
Daisy and I want to get into something else like the guided missiles and stuff.
We hear they're going places.
One hamburger, and hold the onions, lover-boy.
Hold the onions?
I'd rather hold a tomato.
Do you get it?
Tomato?
- Draw one black, sweetie.
- One black, coming up.
Say, did you hear about the monkey that played piano at parties?
No, I didn't.
This will kill you.
His tail fell in this lady's coffee and she says, "Do you know your tail is in my coffee"?
And the monkey says, "No, but if you whistle it, I'll try to play it".
You get it?
Oh, boy, nothing.
You gals, no sense of humor.
I get the same reaction at home from my wife.
I got a million of them, a million of them.
What's the matter, Barney?
Cat got your tongue?
No, it's still there.
What do you suppose he's trying to say, Wilma?
You think the boys will get their jobs back, Wilma?
We'll know in a little while.
Fred said he'd call as soon as he found out.
That's Fred.
Keep your fingers crossed, Betty.
Hello?
Yes, Fred, it's me.
You did?
And what about Barney?
He did?
That's wonderful.
- They got their jobs back, Betty.
- That's a relief.
Fred, let's celebrate tonight and all go out to dinner.
I'll make the reservations.
Hurry home, dear.
I gotta admit it, you girls are real good sports not being sore about that you-know-what.
We all make mistakes, Fred.
You got your job back, that's the important thing.
And after all, you managed to get rid of the you-know-what with only a 50% loss.
Will you excuse us, Fred?
Betty and I are going to nose our powder.
Sure, honey.
Take your time.
Yeah, and when you get back, we'll have a little dance.
Barney-boy, there go two of the good ones.
You said it, Fred.
Some wives would keep hammering and yammering at you just because you made a little mistake.
Yeah, try to make you feel small.
Right.
But not Wilma and Betty.
They haven't even mentioned the subject.
They've dismissed it from their minds.
Ladies and gentlemen the Rockadero Club brings you a special attraction tonight.
A little number dedicated to the gentlemen at table six: Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.
Here we come on the run With a burger on a bun And a dab of coleslaw on the side Oh, your taste we will tickle With a cold dill pickle And all of our potatoes are French-fried, fried, fried Our burgers can't be beat 'Cause we grind our own meat Grind, grind, grind, grind, grind Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble Are to blame for all our trouble And if they think that we'll forget They're out of their mind, mind, mind, mind, mind Thank you, girls, thank you.
That was Mrs. Flintstone and Mrs. Rubble, folks.
They call themselves "Charlie and Irving".
Well, like you said, Barney some wives would try to make a guy feel small.
Yeah, ain't it the truth.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Wilma, where are you?
I'm here, Fred, under the bed.
- Under the bed?
- That's what I said.
Did the big bad prowler scare you?
I forgot my loot.
The prowler!
Fred, you'd better hurry, or you'll be late for work.
I'm hurrying.
I'll be with you as soon as I shave.
Fred, it would be nice if you were ready just once - when Barney comes to pick you up.
- I'm ready.
- Where's breakfast?
- It's ready.
Three-and-a-half hours soft-boiled dodo egg coming up.
And don't leave half of it as usual.
Just get me my toast and maybe I can leave.
- What was that?
- Search me?
Sounds like it came from Barney's house.
Anything could come from Barney's house.
Step on it, Fred, we're going to be late.
Hold it, Barney.
What's going on at your house?
Like, meaning what?
Like, meaning that, that's what.
- Oh, that.
That's Betty.
- That's Betty?
Sure, she's taking judo lessons.
Judo lessons?
What for?
What's with you, Fred, don't you read the papers?
"Citizens warned to be on lookout for phantom burglar".
- So, why the judo?
- A woman's gotta protect herself.
What about you?
She'll protect me, too.
Oh, boy.
It's getting late, fellas.
Yeah, let's get going.
Wait till the fellas down at work get a load of this.
Barney's wife taking judo lessons to protect him.
Wilma, better hurry up.
They're waiting for you.
Okay.
They're waiting for what?
And who's they?
They is Betty and Professor Rockimoto and they are waiting for me.
Hold it.
You are not taking judo lessons.
That is final, clear, and once and for all, no.
What's wrong with trying to protect myself?
- What about me?
- I'll protect you, too.
Yeah, Fred, wait till the guys at work hear about your wife taking judo lessons to protect you.
Out!
Is Wilma there?
Hi, Betty, I thought it would be you.
Listen, the judo lessons are out.
- No.
- It's no judo lesson.
You know it's not the lessons, it's the money.
That's for sure.
Wait till he finds out I already paid for the first lesson.
You might as well take it.
The Professor's still here.
And I don't think he's the refund type.
That for sure.
Maybe one lesson is all you need.
No, I guess you'll need more.
- So very sorry.
- So is she.
Save me a seat, I'll be back in a minute.
So, now you are ready for lesson number one.
Ready but not willing.
Here we go.
One thing about judo, you take a polite beating.
- Does it hurt?
- Only when I'm sitting.
What hurts more is that I paid for 10 lessons.
That for sure.
That for very dang sure.
- Hiya, Fred.
- Hop in, Barney.
- Sounds like you need new brakes.
- You can say that again.
Look at the paper.
How about that.
How about what?
"Prowler strikes again.
"Burglar proves too elusive for police".
You don't have to worry.
Your wife is gonna protect you with judo.
Yeah, she's doing real good, too.
She's taking her fifth lesson today.
Fifth lesson?
You mean you're still letting her take lessons?
- And what's wrong with that?
- What's wrong with it?
It's going to cost me money, that's what's wrong with it.
- Cost you money?
- Indubitably.
I might go so far as to say in-double-dubitably.
If you let Betty have judo lessons, next she'll be taking up jai alai then free-for-all wrestling, next the bongo drums.
How many times can I say no?
- I'm asking you.
- So it's all my fault?
Certainly, it's your fault.
You start learning to say no, and we'll all be ahead.
You heard me tell Wilma no judo lessons, that's final, clear and once and for all, no judo lessons.
Greetings.
Greetings, neighbor.
Ready for honorable lesson number five?
Ready, honorable neighbor.
There's nothing to it.
I get a stranglehold on your sleeve and I toss you onto that pile of pillows over there.
You mean that itty-bitty pile of pillows way over there?
Fred isn't going to like this.
Relax, he won't care.
I'm giving you my lessons free.
- I don't think I'm going to like it either.
- Here goes.
You missed.
I missed?
Who threw who?
It doesn't make any difference.
Prowlers aren't supposed to land on pillows.
- Now she tells me.
- Okay, now it's your turn.
You mean I throw you?
- I'm going to like that.
- Now, I'm a prowler.
I pick the lock on this door.
You hear it.
Your heart's pounding with excitement.
You see the prowler's hand reaching inside.
Reaching, reaching.
- What do you do?
- I scream for Fred.
That won't do you any good.
Fred's under the bed.
- What else do you do?
- I faint.
That's what else.
- No.
- What else is there?
You grab his arm and you give him what I just gave you.
Free judo lesson number five.
What a time to start teaching anybody.
Okay, I'll pretend I'm the prowler.
I'll go outside.
When I open the door, you grab my arm and you flip me across the room.
Now remember your lesson.
Okay, I grab his arm I apply free lesson number five.
- Let me know when you're ready.
- Just a minute, I'm thinking.
- Hiya, Betty.
- Hello, Fred.
Made good time tonight.
Traffic was light.
- By the way, Barney's starving.
- He is?
I better head home and get his dinner.
Wilma.
Fred, no!
You're home early, Fred.
You've been taking judo lessons.
What did you say?
I didn't say anything.
I'm thinking.
It's either the lawn mower, or I can hear you thinking.
And I know what you're thinking.
And I still think it's okay for a woman to take judo lessons.
I don't.
It's a waste of money, and it's a waste of time talking to you.
At least I don't have to hide under the bed if the prowler shows up!
- Who said I did?
- Wilma told Betty.
She heard a noise and tried to get under the bed.
And she couldn't.
You were there first.
All right, smart guy, let's see who gets under the bed tonight.
I'll prove to you you're wasting your money.
Like how?
After you've gone to bed, I'll sneak in, dressed like a burglar.
Then what do you think your wife will do?
She'll say, "Hello, Fred, why steal it?
"Just borrow it as usual".
All right, funny man if she doesn't scream for help and jump under the bed I'll pay for the judo lessons.
Okay?
Is that a bet?
It's a bet.
I'd be less than a husband if I didn't stand behind my wife.
With her judo lessons, it's the safest place to be.
Good night, Fred.
Where's my ear plugs?
A real sneaky exit, if I say so myself.
The masked prowler strikes again.
Now we'll see who screams and jumps under the bed.
What is this?
Two of us working the same neighborhood?
I'd better practice some prowler routines before I go in.
Let's see.
All right, you guys, I've got you covered.
Don't move a muscle or I'll blast you, see.
I don't believe it.
I must be having hallucinations.
What is this, anyway, amateur night?
A couple of screwy faces ought to send her under the bed in a hurry.
Like I'm going to report that guy to the prowlers union.
Next thing you know he'll try something unethical like going in the front door.
And he is!
Barney said he'd leave the door open.
How about that.
It's locked.
I'll have to try the window.
I've got to admit, he's got style.
I'd better hit that house over there before he gets to it.
Barney.
Give me a hand through the window.
I don't think we ought to go through with it, Fred.
No, you don't, I'm going to prove this judo is a waste of time and money once and for all.
Now come on, give me a hand.
Okay, Fred, you're asking for it.
All right, now heave.
How do you like that.
I never get that kind of cooperation when I rob a house.
Boy, you're a big one.
Shut up and heave.
Okay!
Heave!
Help!
Barney, get me out of here!
Just a minute, Fred, I'll have you out in a jiffy.
Hurry up, I can't breathe.
I think the number five mallet will do the trick.
Steady, Fred.
I bat a sticky wicket.
Fore!
What a shot.
A hole in one.
All right, come on, open the door.
I can't, Fred.
It locked when I came out.
Oh, boy.
Okay, now, give me boost in the window.
Gee, I don't know, Fred, you're pretty fat.
Never mind that, wise guy, make with the hands.
I'm telling you you're too heavy.
Easy now.
One, two, alley Can't you do anything right?
Why don't we do it the easy way, Fred?
I'll get the ladder.
The ladder?
Yeah.
I was just about to suggest that.
Now hold it till I get in.
Hold it steady.
- I'm doing my best, Fred.
- That ain't enough, you've got to - She didn't wake up.
- I know.
She sleeps like a rock.
Maybe you ought to come back tomorrow.
You're out of your mind.
- Now, go on over there and wake her up.
- She's not going to like it.
And she wakes up awfully mean and cranky.
Stop yakking, a bet's a bet.
You asked for it.
Betty.
Let me sleep five more minutes, Barney.
There's a prowler here to see you.
Tell him we don't want any.
Prowler!
Help, Barney!
See, what did I tell you, Barney?
Help, Barney!
Head for the hills!
I told him she wakes up awful mean and cranky.
That judo's dangerous.
I hope Wilma didn't wake up.
Talk about nerve.
Burgle two houses in one night?
Ain't you being a little greedy, buster?
- But it's mine.
- And who saw it first?
Out!
It's the prowler.
I got to help Wilma.
I said beat it!
I'd better call the police.
I'll use Barney's phone.
Barney, he's back.
Help!
Help, Barney!
Call the police.
She needs the police?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
You mean that was Fred and it wasn't the prowler at all?
Not at all, just old Fred.
I'm going to tell Wilma about her big fat practical joker before he scares her to death.
Hello?
Is Wilma there?
Yeah, she's here.
It's for you.
Thanks.
Hello?
Gee, dames.
That's Wilma.
I'm coming, honey.
Wilma, what's wrong?
The prowler, he's here.
No, it's not.
It's Fred.
- Fred?
- Fred?
He's not in bed.
Lessons two and three?
Serves him right.
I'll give him lessons four and five if he tries it on me again.
If he's laid a finger on her I'll tear him apart.
Are you okay?
It is the prowler.
Luckily, I have had judo lessons which my chintzy husband didn't want to pay for.
Buster, haven't we met before?
Believe it or not, he tried it again.
You gave him lesson number three?
Oh, boy.
Poor Fred.
I wish he'd come back here again.
I like the practice.
So it's you.
You don't seem to get the message.
Jump me when I'm not looking, huh?
For the last time, out.
And stay out.
I better stay here and think things over.
Maybe Fred will change his mind now.
You mean, to let you take judo lessons?
I doubt it.
One thing for sure he won't be trying that burglar bit again in a hurry.
He's had it.
Believe it or not, he just won't quit playing cops and robbers.
He's at it again.
- What are you going to do?
- Judo lesson five.
Give him lesson number five?
He asked for it.
I'd better see if the coast is clear.
If Fred still wants to play prowler, I'll go along with the gag.
I might well play it to the hilt.
The prowler!
If it is, I'd better notify his next of kin.
We better get over there and save Fred.
No, let him have fun scaring Wilma.
Buster, just call the cops.
Now ain't that a kick in the head.
Had enough, Freddie?
Lady, you've been taking judo lessons.
That's for sure.
Fred!
It's the prowler!
It's all yours, bub.
I'm cutting out of here.
- Hey, Fred.
- Fred, what happened?
Where's Wilma?
In the house.
She took one look at the prowler, screamed, and ducked inside.
- The prowler?
- Yeah, the real thing.
- Come on, we'd better find her.
- She must be scared.
Wilma, where are you?
I'm here, Fred, under the bed.
- Under the bed?
- That's what I said.
You hear that, Barney?
What did I tell you?
See the prowler, big scream, zip and under the bed.
What happened, Wilma?
Did the big bad prowler scare you?
Excuse me, folks.
I forgot my loot.
The prowler!
Boy, this is a for real nuthouse, that's for sure.
You're really going through with it?
I have to.
A guy's gotta learn to protect himself.
Yeah, from his wife.
Don't forget, fellows, we're six lessons ahead of you.
Yes, is very good for families to taking judo lessons.
Yes, it make for togetherness.
Fred?
Sukiyaki.
First, I are recommending ten easy bronze medal family plan.
Very cheap.
That's for sure.
Next, move into additional 20 silver medal lessons.
Special discount prices, big bargain.
Then, for a few more measly dollars you are eligible for gold medal diamond medal, etcetera, etcetera.
What does "etcetera, etcetera" mean in Japanese?
Sucker?
That's for sure.
Excuse please, sounds like a new customer.
Yes, please, what can I do for you?
I want to sign up for some private judo lessons.
A prowler's got to learn to protect himself if he's going to stay in business these days, right?
That for sure.
By the way, how's business with you?
Pretty good?
You're not just whistling Dixie.
Wilma!
Wilma, open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
How's the air up there, girls?
It's getting thin, Fred, just like my patience.
The girls are sure having a ball, aren't they, Barney?
Yeah, they're having a great time.
What happened?
Wilma, I'm home!
Fred.
My goodness, he's a minute early.
He must have gone through a red light.
I'm coming through the door, Wilma.
- I'm sitting down, Wilma.
- Oh, dear!
Hello, Fred.
How did it go at the job today?
Late with my dinner again, Wilma?
That's the second time this month.
You know I like my plate to be on the table when I sit down.
I'm sorry, Fred.
I work hard all day, and when I get home what do I get?
You work hard all day?
You, you, that's all I hear.
I work hard all day, too, and what do I get?
A lot of yak from you.
You at least get out every day, see things, talk to people.
I never get out of this cave.
If you'd only take me out once in a while Hold it.
Hold it right there!
I got you now.
Never take you out?
How short a memory can you have?
Let's see.
I give up.
Where did you ever take me?
Okay, I'll tick them off for you.
There was the time I took you to a No, that was Barney.
Wait a minute, I'm still ticking them.
And there was a Let me see now.
I don't hear any more ticking, Fred.
Maybe your clock stopped.
"Maybe your clock stopped".
Droll, very droll.
I know I took you someplace.
- I got it.
Boulder Beach.
- Boulder Beach?
Come now, Fred.
How could you avoid taking your wife on your honeymoon?
But if there was a way, I know you would have thought of it.
I'm surprised you didn't take your pal Barney instead of me.
We spent most of our honeymoon at the Boulder Beach bowling alley.
Okay, now you've done it.
Done what, Fred?
You got me all upset.
I can't eat my dinner.
- Okay, I'll throw it out.
- Hey, come back with that.
I'll eat it out on the front stoop.
Boulder Beach.
They had a great set of bowling alleys there.
I hate to have words with Fred.
Neither of us mean what we say when we're mad.
I have a bad day on the job, and I take it out on poor Wilma.
- Hiya, Fred.
- Barney!
It's lonesome over on my stoop.
Do you mind?
Be my guest, Barney-boy.
My stoop is your stoop.
We wouldn't be out here, unless we were both stupes.
What was it this time, Fred?
You know, the you-never-take-me-anyplace routine.
- What did you and Betty ding-a-ling about?
- Same thing.
- I think they got a point.
- Yeah, I guess so.
Say, Fred - I've got an idea.
- Not the Foreign Legion again.
- No.
- Good.
They turned me down last year.
Flatfeet.
Fred, let's take the girls out tonight.
That's not a bad idea.
We take them out, and we don't have to eat out here on the stoops so often.
- Someplace real nice.
- Right, so they'll remember it.
Yeah, but where?
If they only played pool, it would be no problem.
- I got it, Fred.
- Yeah, what?
How about taking the girls to the ball game?
The ball game?
I'm surprised at you, Barney.
- Well, it was just a suggestion.
- And it's a dumb suggestion because the ball team is playing out of town all this week.
Oh, yeah.
Well, let's brainstorm this, Fred.
We'll come up with something.
- Barney!
- What is it, Fred?
This is so big, it scares me.
It's not a brainstorm, it's a regular typhoon.
- What is it, Fred?
I'm all ears.
- Wait, don't rush me.
I will let you in on the thought process.
I figure we want the girls to have a good time, right?
- Right.
- And a good time means lots of fun, right?
- Right.
- Then I thought: "Where can we have fun"?
And all of a sudden the answer comes to me.
- And that is?
- The funhouse.
The funhouse!
What a mind!
Yeah, the funhouse, down at the amusement park.
What do you think, Barney?
That's great, Fred!
It's a wonderful idea.
Get Betty to come over right away.
We'll spring it on them together.
Boy, won't they be surprised?
The funhouse at the amusement park?
Are you two out of your mind?
What do you think we are, a couple of kids?
Wilma, just a minute.
I don't know about you - but I'll settle for the amusement park.
- But, Betty, the funhouse?
I know, but I never get any further than the supermarket.
Maybe there are people out there, homes, streets.
- I'll never find out unless we go.
- Well, do we go?
- All right, I guess so.
- Swell.
And, Wilma, start packing plenty of sandwiches.
What?
Fred, once, just once will you try to forget that stomach of yours?
That's asking him to forget an awful lot, Wilma.
It's cracks like that that gets a guy a fat lip, Barney.
How's the air up there, girls?
It's getting thin, Fred, just like my patience.
The girls are sure having a ball, aren't they, Barney?
Yeah, they're having a great time.
Remember, Betty, you agreed to let the boys take us here.
I'm sorry, Wilma.
I guess I should've known better.
What happened?
- Are you sure this is safe, Barney?
- Sure, you'll love it.
Here we go again.
Hang on!
Come on, girls.
They got four seats left on the rocket-to-the-moon ride.
You and Barney go, Fred.
Betty and I will rest here for a few minutes.
- Okay, but you're going to miss all the fun.
- I know.
I haven't had such fun since I had a tooth pulled.
We better stop before we laugh our way into a hospital.
Fred, look, there's one of those photo machines.
I think I'll have a picture taken for Wilma.
She's still carrying the one I took for my high school graduation.
Put a coin in the slot, Barney.
I'm ready.
All right, keep your eye on the birdie, Fred.
It's finished.
How about that, Barney?
Isn't science wonderful?
Hey, Fred, look over there.
That gives me an idea, Barney.
We can make a record for the girls, a sort of souvenir of their night out.
Hey, that's a great idea, Fred.
And every time they say we don't take them out, we'll play it back to them.
- Okay, Barney, put the coin in.
- Put the coin in?
Why is it I'm always the one that puts the coin in things, Fred?
- You bashful or something?
- Of course not, Barney.
It's just that I haven't got any small change.
Yeah, this is the sixth time today you didn't have any small change.
How about that?
The bird's got a long-play beak.
Why don't you go first, Barney?
I don't know what to say.
Gee, Fred, I don't know what to say either.
Oh, brother, every customer, the same thing.
They want to make a record, but they don't know what to say.
How about Mary Had a Little Lamb, Hickory Dickory Dock the alphabet, your name?
Come on, fellows.
I was taking a bath when you came in.
- Hey, Barney, I got a good idea.
- Yeah, what?
- I'll sing.
- Oh, no!
The girls will love it.
Oh, boy, I'll need more than a bath after this.
- Start the record, Barney.
- Right.
Who's that swinging down the street?
Who's the birdie with the two-four beat?
The two-beat wails come soft but sweet Listen to the doody bird sing Listen to the rocking bird Listen to the rocking bird The rocking bird is swinging all day long Listen to the rocking Beats me where they could have gone.
Funny we can't find them.
We've been looking for an hour.
I've got a good mind to go home without them.
That's not bad, Barney.
- Play it back once more.
- Right, Fred.
Who's that swinging down the street?
Who's the birdie with the two-four beat?
- What's that horrible noise, Wilma?
- I don't know.
- Maybe some animal is caught in a trap.
- Oh, the poor thing.
Betty, look.
- Hiya, Wilma.
- Hi, Betty.
- We've had it, Fred.
We're going home.
- But we made a record for you.
I'll say you did, the most miserable time on record.
We get one night out, and so these sports take us to an amusement park.
Then they got the colossal nerve to leave us sitting on a bench.
- While they're having a good time.
- Big deal.
- Dream stuff, look what I found.
- What is it, boy next door?
Some cornball cut a side and forgot it.
Just for laughs, let's get the gang together and give it a spin.
Cool, sound the alarm, and we'll meet at my place.
Listen to the rocking bird, way out Listen to the crazy bird, he flips The rocking bird is wailing his last song Hand me my shooting iron - So what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.
It's the most!
- Man, what a beat!
- That cat understands us teenagers.
And so few do.
Okay, worshippers of good music, repeat after me: We, the teenagers of Bedrock have a new singing idol who understands our problems and we will be loyal to him forever.
I thought we were going to be loyal forever to Hot Lips Hannigan.
That was last week.
Hot Lips is out.
Colonel, I'm glad you're here.
You can put Keen-Teen Record Company on top of the heap.
- And how's that, sir?
- Forget Hot Lips Hannigan.
Forget everybody.
Find this new guy and find him fast.
I dubbed some music behind his voice and this guy is Find him.
We'll put him on personal appearances, TV shows, the works.
- We got to cash in fast.
- Don't you fret, sir.
I'll get him.
Don't forget, I made a big star out of that boy from Georgia.
- What's his name again?
- Never mind.
Go, Colonel.
They're fickle record buyers, these teenagers.
Oh, boy, how they pick them.
What a business.
Say, Fred, isn't that the record you made at the amusement park?
- Yeah, how did you get it?
- I didn't.
They're playing it on the radio.
That's nice.
On the radio?
And that's the latest smash hit by that great unknown troubadour.
If anyone knows who this singer is please contact the Keen-Teen Record Company immediately.
- I don't get it.
- Hello, Keen-Teen Record Company?
I have that singer you're looking for.
They hung up.
There he is, Colonel.
What do you think?
Can we do something with him?
I don't know.
It won't be easy as with that Georgia boy.
Maybe we can call him "the world's oldest teenager".
Not bad.
Come on, sir.
Into the next room, and we'll get you all fixed up.
What are they doing in there all this time?
The Colonel is the best promotion man in the business, ma'am.
- He's thinking up some kind of gimmick.
- Gimmick?
Yeah, something that will catch on with the teenagers.
Okay, boy, come on out.
- Hi, Wilma.
- Meet Hi-Fye 'cause that's his new name.
This boy will sell like crazy.
Why, the clothes will get the kids, the glasses will pull in the eggheads and the gimmick is sensational.
Show him your gimmick.
Listen to him rock, listen to him roll Listen to the ricky-ticky rocking bird Do you hear him?
Well, grab him, nab him Listen to the rocking bird Listen to the rocking bird The rocking bird is swinging all day long Listen to the rocking bird He's a crook Listen to the nutty, nutty bird The rocking bird It's wonderful of Fred to make Barney his business manager.
Yeah, it gives us all a chance to go on the personal appearance tour.
We're sure getting out of the house in a big way, Wilma.
Just think, we'll see all the sights, visit the big cities, stop at the best places.
And we'll be traveling first class all the way.
- This is terrible, Betty.
- First class?
It's terrible.
Now I know what a milkshake feels like.
Colonel, do we have to travel like this?
Ma'am, it's the only way to make the one-night stands we're booked for.
But just keep in mind, ma'am there's no business like show business.
You are so right.
And here he is, you cats your singing idol: Hi-Fye.
Listen to him rock, listen to him roll Listen to the ricky-ticky rocking bird Go, man!
Do you hear him?
Well, grab him, nab him Go, go!
Listen to the rocking bird They must have polished that act with sandpaper.
It's kind of scary, isn't it, Wilma?
Yeah, what do those kids see in him?
Those kids are okay, ma'am.
They're the ones that buy the records and they have the right to get what they pay their money for.
- They know what they want, too.
- What's that?
Something different all the time.
And, boy, is this different!
I wonder whatever happened to that Georgia boy.
Maybe his legs gave out.
- You're our idol, Hi-Fye!
- Yeah, you're the greatest.
Sign my autograph book next, will you, Hi?
Look at those kids.
You know, all this hero-worship could get Fred conceited.
No, not good old Fred.
I don't know.
Good old Fred is only good old human.
- He's got a good head on his shoulders.
- Did you see that, Wilma?
Those are smart kids.
They know real talent when they see it.
- "Real talent," Fred?
- Maybe I am the greatest, who knows?
What's my opinion against millions of music lovers?
But I don't want to talk about myself.
Why don't you girls talk about me for a while?
That good head on his shoulders is getting bigger all the time.
Hello, is that you, Colonel?
How's the tour going?
Great.
Hi-Fye is still hot?
Keep it jumping.
We got to get it while the getting's good.
Tony, press another half million records.
And get them out fast.
Hi-Fye is still going strong.
Well, Betty, we've been on the road for two weeks.
How do you like the sights?
The only sight I've seen on the whole trip is the one I see in my mirror.
You're not just kidding.
Go, go, go Listen to him rock, listen to him roll Listen to the ricky-ticky rocking bird Do you hear him?
- This is awful, Wilma.
- I want to go home.
Let's talk to the Colonel again.
Now, don't worry, ladies.
It'll call itself off any time now.
These kids are tough on singing idols.
One day an idol's on top the next day the FBI couldn't find him.
You just be patient, ladies.
It's got to happen.
I hope so, Colonel.
Colonel, you said a week ago that we'd be going home - and here we are still on the road.
- I don't understand it, either, ladies.
By rights, Hi-Fye should've burned out a long time ago but he's hotter than ever.
Only happened once before.
Was a good-looking Georgia boy.
Can't think of his name right now.
Had long sideburns.
I'm sorry, ladies.
This Hi-Fye thing could go on for a long time, yet.
- You have my sympathies.
- Thanks loads, Colonel.
Go, go, go Listen to him rock, listen to him roll Listen to the ricky-ticky rocking bird Do you hear him?
Wilma, I've had it.
Another week of this will drive me out of my mind.
I've been thinking, Betty, and I've got an idea.
What is it?
We'll start an ugly rumor about Hi-Fye and the kids will drop him like a hot potato.
What rumor could be that ugly?
There's one thing that's unforgivable to teenagers.
You think it'll work?
I'm sure it will.
Come on, we'll give it a try.
- Yes, Wilma.
- Did you hear the lowdown on Hi-Fye?
No, Wilma, what is it?
I got it from a reliable source.
- Hi-Fye is really a square.
- No!
You mean like four corners?
That's exactly what I mean.
Did you hear about Hi-Fye?
You mean No!
The word is getting around fast.
It's the worst word in the teenage language.
I hope it works.
Listen to him rock, Listen to him rock Thank you, all you cats!
Thank you, everybody!
Hey, where did everybody go?
Endsville, boss, that's what I said.
Endsville, just like that.
Right, Colonel.
Stop the machines, Tony.
Hi-Fye's had it.
It means the end of the line, Hi-Fye.
It's where the track comes together up on the pole.
But what happened?
Who knows?
These kids don't fool around.
You're in or you're out.
Besides, you're lucky.
You can go home now.
I got to start a tour with the kid that plays the bongos with his feet while he sings who's from Georgia, I hear.
It feels kind of good to be back home again, Barney.
Yeah, and we're lucky to get our old jobs back.
Anyway, the girls won't be giving us any more of that l-never-get-out-of-the-house routine.
No, sir, not after that trip we took across the country.
Wilma, I'm home.
Boy, that dinner looks good.
Brontosaurus stew, my favorite dish.
What?
Tonight?
Are you out of your mind?
We are definitely not going out tonight, and that's final!
Tonight!
Nothing doing, Betty!
And that's final!
- Betty was ironing all day.
- Say no more, Barney.
So was Wilma.
You know, Barney, there's something about ironing all day that brings out the worst in women.
Yeah, but even the worst is pretty good, Fred.
Yeah, bless their you-never- take-me-out-anyplace little hearts.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Mr. Flintstone, your teacher will be Miss Gravel.
How do you do, Mr. Flintstone?
Likewise, I'm sure.
And Mr. Rubble this is Miss Pitchblend, your partner.
Welcome to our studio.
Barney.
Say something!
Hiya, partner.
Good morning.
You're early today.
Since we got these new mail carts, I get around faster.
Sure beats lugging this bundle around on my back all day.
- Is there any mail for us?
- Let us see.
Yep, a letter for you, Mrs. Flintstone.
Thanks.
Probably another bill.
That's all we seem to get these days.
Bills, magazines, advertisements, that's all I deliver.
Doesn't anybody write just plain old letters anymore?
Well, for goodness sake.
Wait till Betty hears this.
All right, Wilma, I'm sitting down, and I've got a good grip on myself.
Now, what's the big news?
Well, you read about the big charity dance they're holding at the Rockadero Tilton, haven't you?
Who hasn't.
It's the swankiest affair of the year.
Right.
And the tickets cost $100 a piece.
I know, and that's 200 reasons why Barney and I can't go.
But you are going.
You and Barney are going with Fred and me for free.
Hello.
Betty, did you hear me?
But will you say that last part again, slowly?
It's true.
You've heard of Mrs. Beardsley Gotrocks III?
Sure.
She's married to one of the richest men in Bedrock.
Well, before she was married Mrs. Beardsley Gotrocks III was my school chum Gussie Gravelpit.
Gussie Gravelpit?
She and her husband were going to the dance but he came down with the measles or something, so she sent me her tickets.
There are four of them.
Good old Gussie.
Wait till the boys hear the news.
What's the matter, Betty?
Suppose the boys won't take us.
How can they refuse?
We've overcome their only objection.
It's free.
You're right, Wilma.
But just to play it safe I'll fix an extra special dinner for Barney before I spring the news on him.
That's a good idea, Betty.
I'll do the same for my dancing partner.
Wake up, Barney-boy, we'll be home in a couple of minutes.
I wasn't sleeping, Fred.
I always keep my eyes shut when you're driving.
That's funny, so does Wilma.
I guess it's kind of relaxing to know I'm at the wheel.
Relaxing nothing.
It's terrifying.
Barney, so help me.
One more crack like that and I'll pull the plug on this car pool.
Relax, Fred.
I'm only joking.
It's a good thing you're not a comedian.
With a sense of humor like that, you'd starve to death.
Come on, Dino, your daddy's home.
Dino sure loves Fred.
No, Dino, wait.
Dino, stop it.
Down, boy.
Heel!
Wilma, do something.
Come on, you two, in the house.
Why can't he just greet me like other pets?
All right, Dino, put daddy down.
Oh, boy.
Every night the same thing.
- That was a swell dinner, Wilma.
- Thanks, Fred.
And now for a nice surprise.
We're going to the big charity dance at the Rockadero Tilton.
Are you out of your mind?
It costs too much.
Free tickets.
- You'll want a new gown.
- I'll wear my old one.
- Well, there's the corsage.
- I'll wear some daisies from our garden.
- After the dance you'll want to eat.
- I'll bring sandwiches.
- Give up, Fred?
- We're not going to the dance.
Come on, Fred.
What reason could you possibly have for not going?
- I got my reasons.
- Fred.
Your idea of a good time is watching a ball game on TV while I feed you sandwiches.
I've gone along with it for a long time because I know it's expensive to go out but when we can go to the swankiest dance of the year for free and you still won't take me Fred, you're becoming antisocial.
I've still got my reasons.
Sometimes that Fred!
Hi, Fred.
Barney, why aren't you home watching the ball game on TV?
I had a little tiff with Betty.
A little difference of opinion about going to the charity dance.
You, too?
Why won't you go, Barney?
Will you promise me you won't laugh, Fred?
Believe me, I'm in no laughing mood.
I can't dance.
You meet people there and you're supposed to dance.
It's too embarrassing.
- But why aren't you going, Fred?
- Word for word the same reason.
- Two left feet.
- It's sure not fair to the girls.
I know, and I feel awful about it.
There ought to be something we could do.
We could learn to dance.
- That's it, Barney.
- It is?
But how do we learn, Fred?
How does anyone learn anything?
From a book, of course.
Now look, you run down to the library and get a book on dancing.
I'll back the car out of the garage.
We can start practicing right away.
Then we can take the girls to the dance without being embarrassed.
- Right?
- Right.
Get going, pal.
Fred, I'm back.
Not so loud, we don't want the girls to know about this.
- Did you get the book?
- Yep, here it is.
That's swell, Barney.
We'll start off with an easy one.
- Like the tango.
- Yeah, tango.
Here it is, Fred.
The tango with diagrams.
There's nothing to it.
Look, we just follow the footprints.
All right now, here we go.
You sure you got the steps memorized?
Oh, yeah, it's a cinch.
Lead on, Fred.
Okay, the tango.
Here goes.
- Say, you follow pretty good, Barney.
- Thanks, Fred.
- Barney.
- Yeah, Fred.
Get off my feet.
- But it's easier to follow you this way.
- Well, it ain't the right way.
Now get off.
And remember the tango is graceful sinuous, smooth.
- Let's do it right.
- Yeah, okay, Fred.
Now we got it.
Graceful, sinuous, smooth.
So much for the basic steps, Barney-boy.
Now let's try some fancy stuff.
- Ready?
- Yep.
Hold it, Fred.
Hold it.
Wait a minute.
Fred, let go.
Now what kind of a step is that?
It's not a step, it's my sacroiliac.
- Don't worry, Barney.
I'll adjust it for you.
- No, Fred.
Don't touch me, don't.
Come on, Barney.
Don't be a sissy.
I know how to fix it.
Now stop it, will you?
Stop squirming, Barney.
Hold still.
- Fred.
- Barney.
What are you two doing?
We were just practicing some wrestling holds.
- Wrestling holds?
- Sure.
Weren't we, Barney?
Yeah, like this one.
It's called the body slam.
I guess men are just boys that never grow up.
And if they keep this up, they won't grow any older either.
- Hey, Fred.
- Yeah, Barney.
You know, I've been thinking.
It's a cinch we're not going to figure out how to dance from that book.
You know, I've been thinking the same thing.
Look, maybe we ought to go to one of those dancing schools?
Now you're talking.
We'll drop in at the Arthur Quarry Dance School right after work, and we'll sign up.
Yeah, okay, Fred.
We'll stop by on the way home.
Here we are, Barney.
Let's go in.
Gee, Fred, I'm kind of scared.
Do you think we're doing the right thing?
Do you want to take the girls to the dance?
- But of course.
- Then we're doing the right thing.
- There's no one here, Fred.
Let's go home.
- Wait a minute.
- Who's in charge?
- Good evening, gentlemen.
Welcome to the Arthur Quarry Dance School.
- Can I help you, gentlemen?
- Yes, ma'am, we want to learn to dance.
Well, you came to the right place.
We have a one year, all-inclusive course that will teach One year?
We haven't got that much time.
There's our six month course but that doesn't include the Hopi Indian rain dance.
- The Hopi - And if you ever met a Hopi Indian you'd just be out of luck.
- We'll have to take that chance.
- But, Fred - We only got a week.
- A week.
Then you'll need our crash course.
Four lessons a night, every night, and we might make it.
Good, we'll take it.
- But, Fred - Stop interrupting, Barney.
- When do we start, lady?
- Tonight, promptly at 8:30.
Barney-boy, we're all signed up.
We'll be a sensation on the dance floor by next week.
- But, Fred - What is with this "But, Fred" stuff?
What's on your mind?
I was just wondering how we're going to get out of the house every night this week.
Barney, how come you wait till now to tell me?
You should've mentioned it before we signed up and paid out all that dough.
Well, I tried to tell you, Fred, but you wouldn't let me.
- I got another idea, Fred.
- No, not again.
Why don't we join Joe Rockhead's Volunteer Fire Department?
Okay, I know I'm a fool to ask but what has Joe Rockhead's Volunteer Fire Department got to do with our dancing lessons?
Well, if we were volunteer firemen we'd have to leave the house every time the fire bell rings.
And Rocky rings the bell every night at 7:30.
And how, if I might ask, does Rocky know there's going to be a fire every night at 7:30?
There's no fire, Fred.
There's nothing to burn in Bedrock.
Everything is made of stone.
But it gives the volunteer firemen a chance to get out every night and go bowling or play cards.
You know, Fred, man stuff.
But with you and me, why, we could go to the dancing school every night.
- How long has this been going on, Barney?
- A couple of months or so.
What do you think of the idea, Fred?
- I think it's the most despicable - I knew you'd say that.
the most insidious - I knew you'd say that.
the most ingenious idea I ever heard.
- Let's join.
- I knew you'd say that too.
Yeah, it's working out real swell, fellows.
To keep the department efficient we have a mock alert every night at 7:30.
Get it?
When the bell rings, all the firemen report to the firehouse immediately.
Get it?
If there's no fire, and there never is we disband and go back home or wherever.
Most of the fellows go the "wherever" route.
- Are the rules clear?
- Yeah, we got it.
Good.
Now raise your right hand and take the oath.
Do you solemnly swear you will answer the fire bell whenever it rings and never snitch on our brother firefighters?
- We do.
- Congratulations, men.
I'll see you at 7:30.
Dinner is ready, I wonder where Fred is.
Hey, Wilma!
Get a load of this.
Pretty nifty?
What is it, Fred?
It's my new fireman's outfit.
I am now a volunteer fireman.
Volunteer fireman!
But why, Fred?
Because I feel it is my civic duty to protect the citizens of Bedrock.
Barney joined, too.
But, Fred, I don't ever remember seeing any fires in Bedrock.
Yes, but we in the department know that there's going to be a lot of them.
- Every night this week.
- How do you know that, Fred?
I can't tell you that, Wilma.
It's a top secret.
They're up to something.
But what?
Fred, do you have to eat with that hat on?
I got to be ready to scramble, as we say down at the firehouse.
Fred, will you stop looking at the clock?
You'd think you were going somewhere.
Five, four, three, two There it is!
There's a fire somewhere!
Duty calls.
Neither sleet nor slush nor Well, I'll see you later, Wilma.
How civic-minded can one get?
Come on, Barney, let's go.
Coming, Fred.
Wait for me.
We'll run down to the firehouse, Barney, it'll be quicker.
Betty, did you see that?
See it.
I got trampled in the rush.
I never saw firemen so happy about a fire before.
I guess they just love their work.
Nice work, fellows, you're really on the ball.
But it's a false alarm and you can all go home.
Right, Chief.
Good night, Chief.
You know, I bet something like this could catch on all over the country.
It worked like a charm, Barney, didn't it?
Yeah, that Joe Rockhead's a smart one.
And it's only a short walk to the dance school.
Right.
We just do this for a week, and we're all set.
A week.
Are you kidding?
I don't ever intend to let my membership lapse in this fine civic-minded organization.
Now, if you gentlemen will leave your coats here we'll step into the classroom and I'll introduce you to your dancing teachers.
Two charming young ladies.
Gee, Fred.
Lady teachers.
I don't think Betty would like that.
It's only a lesson, Barney, an education.
Well, I never met a girl yet that wasn't an education.
Mr. Flintstone your teacher will be Miss Gravel.
How do you do, Mr. Flintstone?
Likewise, I'm sure.
And, Mr. Rubble this is Miss Pitchblend, who will be your partner.
Good evening, Mr. Rubble.
Welcome to our studio.
Barney.
Say something!
Hiya, partner.
Now, Mr. Flintstone, notice the diagram on the floor.
- The diagram.
- That is the basic step.
Once we learn that, we're on our way.
Aren't we?
Are we?
Now, will you please try it as I count off each step?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ready?
A one.
A two.
A three.
A four.
But, Mr. Rubble, it's all right.
You have to hold hands to dance.
Now, your other hand goes around my waist.
No, that I won't do.
Oh, boy.
Why did I ever quit secretarial school?
But, Betty, this is the fifth night in a row the boys have been out.
I never heard of so many fires.
I know, and always at 7:30.
I stopped by the firehouse this afternoon but that Chief, Joe Rockhead, won't tell me a thing.
He said it was restricted information.
Since when is a fire a secret?
There's something fishy about this, Betty.
- Fred is not that civic-minded.
- Neither is Barney.
Look, come on over, Wilma.
I have an idea how to get our firemen home.
Now, this is your last night, Mr. Flintstone and so far you've practically mastered the basic step.
Oh, it's nothing.
Some guys just have it naturally.
Yes.
Well, tonight we'll try to apply the basic step to various dances.
First the waltz.
Waltzes.
Phooey.
I'm a progressive jazz cat myself.
Now, Mr. Rubble, since this is your last night we'll review the dances you've learned, I mean tried.
- Let's start off with the fox trot.
- Okay, fox trot.
- Mr. Rubble.
- Yeah?
The idea is to wait until the music starts.
Well, what's your idea, Betty?
I'm desperate enough to try anything.
It's simple.
We'll turn in an alarm and watch our heroes in action right here.
That's a good idea.
Of course, it'll be a false alarm but there's something false about those firemen, too.
- Go ahead and call, Betty.
- Okay.
Operator, get me the Volunteer Fire Department, please.
Back of Joe Rockhead's garage.
Rockhead's Volunteer Fire Department.
Chief Rockhead speaking.
A fire.
Are you sure?
Where?
Yes, ma'am.
We'll be right over.
Oh, my goodness, a real fire.
We never had one before.
What'll I do?
I know, I'll get the firemen.
Yeah, that's it, the firemen.
- All right, lady, where's the fire?
- There is no fire.
Thank goodness.
We forgot to bring the hose.
- You also forgot to bring our husbands.
- Your husbands?
Those eager beavers Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble.
Where are they?
I guess they didn't hear the bell, lady.
You'll hear bells if you don't tell us where they are.
Yeah, telephone bells.
When we call up your wives and tell them what a bunch of phony fire-eaters you are.
No, lady, not that.
Please, lady, we got a good thing going.
Besides, we swore not to snitch.
Well, you snitch, or we snitch to your wives.
You brainwashed it out of me, lady.
They're at Arthur Quarry's Dance School.
Arthur Quarry's Dance School!
- How are you doing, Barney-boy?
- Great, Fred.
Nothing to it.
- I like it.
- Me, too.
Boy, won't Wilma and Betty be surprised.
- Hello, Fred.
- Hello, Barney.
- Wilma!
- Betty!
All right, firefighter don't just stand there with your mouth flapping.
Let's hear your story.
Yes, shorty, what do you got to say for yourself?
- We did it for you girls, Betty.
- That's right, we did it all for you girls.
You mean you joined the Volunteer Fire Department So you could go dancing for us?
Yeah, that's right.
It was the only way we could sneak out every night.
Barney, will you shut up?
The truth doesn't even sound right to me.
Honest, Wilma, this is what happened.
Barney and I thought that if we could take dancing lessons we could take you and Betty I sure felt silly when the boys explained what they were doing.
I did, too.
Imagine those two sweet guys planning to surprise us all the time.
We're just lucky with those two.
And here they come now.
Back to the ladies and some more dancing, Barney-boy?
Right, twinkle toes.
Which style of dancing do you like best, Barney?
I don't know.
They're all the same to me.
They're all the same to Fred, too.
Exactly the same.
But who cares, they're in there pitching.
Come on, Wilma, open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Wilma, we've been in 10 dives already, but this is the worst-looking.
- I'm afraid to go in there.
- So am I, Betty.
But for the sake of the boys, we got to go through with it.
- Do you remember your lines?
- Let's go.
- Hey, bartender.
- Yeah, what will you girls have?
- We will have a couple of lemonades.
- Yeah, and put it on the cuff.
Nothing doing.
What do you think I am, a Good Samaritan?
Ain't it a shame, Shirl?
We got a fortune in stolen swag stashed away - and it's too hot to spend.
- It's murder, Myrt.
Looks like we lost the police, Benny.
You can take off your mask now.
Gee, Fingers, can't I keep it on?
It makes me feel like a for-real bank robber.
You are a for-real bank robber.
Where do you think we heisted this bag of dough from, a bakery?
Oh, yeah.
Ever since that last job when the safe door fell on my head I can't seem to remember nothing.
Well, try to remember to keep on the right side of the road.
It's the law!
Step on it, Benny!
I'm all out of breath, Sarge.
You be the siren for a while, while I drive.
There they are up ahead.
Keep that siren going.
What's the matter, Barney?
Nothing, Fred.
You told me to wake you up when it's 3:00.
Oh, yeah.
I left my watch inside.
What time is it now?
- It's 1:00.
- Well, then you have two hours yet.
- Go back to sleep, Fred.
- "Go back to sleep".
Barney, remind me never to use your hammock again.
What do you mean, Fred?
What did I do?
You woke me up right in the middle of a beautiful dream, that's what.
I'm sorry, Fred.
What was the dream about?
Money?
Naturally, I'm a married man.
- Yeah, it figures.
- Boy, was I rich.
I dreamed that me and Wilma had servants waiting on us hand and foot.
- Was me and Betty in the dream, Fred?
- Who do you think the servants were?
You mean Betty and me was working for you?
Yeah, but I was paying you a terrific salary: $1,000 a week.
That was swell of you, Fred.
You're a real pal.
You know me, Barney.
Easy come, easy go.
The cops are gaining on us.
If they catch us with the loot, we'll be sent up for life.
- Yeah, and maybe longer.
What'll we do?
- There's only one thing we can do.
Turn the next corner, Benny, and I'll dump the loot overboard.
$86,000 down the drain.
And after we got back from the world cruise we built the biggest swimming pool you ever saw and filled it with champagne.
No kidding.
Oh, boy, what a dream.
You never saw so many guests going down for the third time with smiles on their faces.
Don't you wish all that money was for real instead of being just a dream?
Yeah, I wish this one was.
- What happened, Fred?
- Get a doctor.
I can't see.
Get two doctors.
Help, I've been killed!
Call Wilma, quick!
Fred, look at this.
It's a sack of money.
Will you stop yelling and get help?
Don't just stand What did you say?
I said you got hit in the head with a sack of money.
It happened.
It's a miracle.
I make a wish and it happens.
Yeah, we're rich!
- Where do you get that "we" stuff?
- Well, after all, the money fell in my yard.
A mere technicality.
Aren't you forgetting it was my wish?
And I gave you the idea to wish for the dough, remember?
For that you expect to be cut in?
You are out of your lead-picking mind.
But, Fred, I deserve something.
We've been friends for years.
Stranger, you do your own wishing.
- Wilma, are you busy?
- Come in, Betty.
I'm catching up on some of my sewing.
You know how it piles up.
I wish Fred would get me a modern sewing machine like yours.
You can use mine anytime you want to, Wilma.
Thanks, but you know how Fred is.
He wouldn't like it.
It would be okay with me.
I'll be finished in a minute, Betty and we'll have some cold swamp root tea over rocks.
Swell.
- Not only that, but I'll sue you.
- Sue me?
For what?
How do I know?
I ain't no lawyer.
Looks like Fred and Barney are at it again.
I wonder what they're arguing about this time.
Something silly as usual.
Let's go see.
Let go, Barney.
It's mine, all mine.
- No, it ain't.
It fell in my yard.
- So what?
I was dreaming about it first.
That don't make no difference.
I'm entitled to half.
Fred, what in the world are you two doing?
Wilma, I want you to settle an argument.
And that's just how it happened.
So it's my money, right?
But it was my idea and my yard.
So I'm entitled to something, right?
No, Barney, you're not entitled to a cent.
You see?
What did I tell you?
Your own wife admits it.
It's mine!
$86,000!
Now, what's the first thing I'll do with all this dough?
Return it.
I'll get me one of those snazzy sports cars, maybe two.
One to go to work in and one to come home in, and then I'll Wilma, it sounded like you said "return it".
That's right, Fred.
Return it.
You've been twisting your hair curlers too tight, Wilma.
- This dough belongs to me.
- Fred Flintstone, you don't really believe that money dropped on you because you wished for it?
- How could you?
- It's easy.
I force myself.
Besides how do I find out who it really belongs to?
Hey, Fred, how about putting an ad in the lost-and-found column?
You know, something like: "Found, $86,000.
"Loser may claim same by identifying the money".
Are you nuts?
Anybody can claim the money that way.
Money is money.
It's easy to describe.
Then take it to the police.
They'll find the owner.
But, Wilma Go on, Fred.
You know it's the right thing to do.
Cheer up, Fred.
Remember the old saying, "Honesty is the best policy".
- With my income, I can't afford the best.
- Come on, pal, forget it.
I'll play some music.
Maybe that'll make you feel better.
And here's a special news bulletin.
Just one hour ago a bag containing a sum of $86,000 was stolen from the Rockville National Bank by two masked bandits who are still at large.
$86,000?
Barney, we got the stolen money in this car.
And now we know who it belongs to.
Although the police expect to apprehend the criminals shortly the bank has offered a reward for the return of the money.
Did you hear that, Fred?
A reward!
I wonder how much we'll get.
$10,000?
$20,000?
We?
My, aren't we plural lately.
I'm helping you return it to the bank, ain't I?
Putting a bag of money in the trunk of my car makes you a partner?
I'm out of gas.
We'll have to stop at the next station.
We interrupt this program to bring you the latest news about the big bank robbery.
Police have thrown a dragnet around the entire city and expect to apprehend the two robbers by nightfall.
Fill her up, bud.
Make it snappy.
We're in a hurry.
Yes, sir.
And for the last time, Barney, I will not split any of the money.
Besides, how much could it be?
There was only $86,000 in that bag.
Well, $86,000 ain't nothing to sneeze at, you know.
You call that a big bank robbery?
It's peanuts compared to some of the others.
Oh, my gosh, it's the bank robbers.
- How much, bud?
- Nothing, sir.
It's on the house.
- A sort of a get-acquainted offer.
- Thanks, I'm pleased to meet you.
Operator, get me the police.
Quick.
Turn the radio on.
Let's see if the cops have any leads on the bank robbery.
Okay, Fred.
And here's the newsflash.
The two bank robbers were seen leaving a gas station a short while ago.
Hey, they spotted those crooks already.
One of the men is described as being a heavyset, vicious thug with dark hair and the other is short, shifty-eyed, and has light hair.
These men are described as being extremely dangerous and police have orders to shoot first and ask questions later.
Boy, I'd hate to meet those two characters in a dark alley.
They're believed heading in the general direction of Rockpeak's Park.
That's where we're going.
Maybe we'll run into them.
I hope not.
And the license number of their car is XYZ 643.
- What's the matter, Fred?
- That's my car.
Two guys leaving the gas station, dark hair, short, shifty-eyed - Barney, they think we're the crooks.
- My, ain't we getting plural all of a sudden.
- It's the cops.
- So what, Fred?
We're not the crooks.
Yeah, I know, but they don't.
We got the stolen money in my car.
They're going to shoot first and ask questions later, remember?
We'll just tell them what happened.
Oh, sure.
Who's going to believe I wished for the money - and it just dropped on my head?
- You believed it, Fred.
Well, the cops won't.
They'll lock me up for a nut.
The way I see it, Fred, you're in plenty of trouble.
I'm in plenty of trouble?
You're in it, too.
And you got to help me out of it.
I'll give you half the reward which should be about About 10 years.
No, thanks, Fred.
Step on it, Fred.
They're gaining on us.
Slow down, Fred.
We're gaining on them.
- Head for the river, Fred.
- The river?
What for?
- They can't follow our tracks in the water.
- That's a good idea.
It's the cops.
I thought you said they couldn't follow our tracks.
- Watch it, the light's going to change.
- I think I can make it.
- Did we lose them?
- Yeah, they didn't make the light.
Step on it!
And now for the 12.
:00 news roundup.
The men who robbed the Rockville Bank this morning have been positively identified.
Here is a police artist's sketch of the desperados from a description by a gas station attendant who saw them less than an hour ago.
Don't they look just like Fred and Barney?
Which reminds me, where are Fred and Barney?
Wilma, quick, pull the shades down, lock the back door.
- What for?
- What are you doing under the table?
Hiding.
The police think we pulled the robbery.
Then that picture on TV, it was Fred and Barney.
TV?
That does it.
Everybody will be looking for us now.
What do we do, Fred?
We've got to get out of here.
This is the first place they'll look for us.
Wilma, when the cops come, you know nothing, you hear?
Nothing.
You're not kidding, Fred.
I don't know why you're running away.
I got no time to explain now.
Come on, Barney, let's go.
Wait, how will we know where to find you?
Look in the classified phone book under "hideouts".
And, Wilma, if I never come back, remember one thing.
What's that, Fred?
Turn the lights off when you go to bed.
Those bills are murder!
- Good grief, Wilma!
What do we do?
- I don't know, Betty but it sure looks like the boys left us holding the bag.
This looks like a good place to hide, Barney.
You go climb to the top of that cliff and see if any cops are following us.
- I'll start collecting some branches.
- Branches?
What for?
I'm going to build a log cabin so I can be president some day.
- I didn't know you wanted to be president.
- Stop clowning around, Barney.
I'm going to cover the car with branches so nobody can spot it from the road.
Now go on, climb that hill.
Fred as president.
For a minute, I thought I'd have to cash in my government bonds.
Boy, I'm no mountain climber, that's for sure.
Help!
Baby pterodactyls.
I'm a mother.
It's the real mama.
I'm in trouble.
Take him, Mama, he's older than me.
Wait a minute.
We're not supposed to fly till we're three weeks old.
Well, two out of three ain't bad.
For crying out loud, Barney, what are you trying to do, kill me?
What happened?
Skip it, Fred.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
Do you think the cops will be able to spot our car where you hid it?
Not the way I camouflaged it.
My Army experience sure came in handy.
- But, Fred, you wasn't in the Army.
- But I picked up a lot of handy hints from the war pictures on the Late, Late Show.
How long do you think we'll have to sit here?
I'm getting dizzy.
Till I figure a way to get out of this mess you got us into.
Me?
I got us into this mess?
Of course, wasn't it you who insisted I try out your new hammock?
I asked you to come over and look at it.
Right.
If I hadn't been in your hammock I wouldn't have got conked by that dough, and we wouldn't be in this fix.
I didn't think of it that way.
I'm sorry, Fred.
I accept your apology.
Now keep quiet while I think of a way to beat this rap.
We've got to think of something, Betty.
We can't let Fred and Barney be wanted men for the rest of their lives.
If only we could find the real crooks.
- Of course, it's our only chance.
- What are you talking about, Wilma?
About what you just said.
We'll have to find the real crooks.
- But how?
- By letting them find us, that's how.
Wilma, we've been in 10 dives already, but this is the worst-looking.
- I'm afraid to go in there.
- So am I, Betty.
But for the sake of the boys, we got to go through with it.
- Do you remember your lines?
- Let's go.
- Hey, bartender.
- Yeah, what will you girls have?
- We will have a couple of lemonades.
- Yeah, and put it on the cuff.
Nothing doing.
What do you think I am, a Good Samaritan?
Ain't it a shame, Shirl?
We got a fortune in stolen swag stashed away - and it's too hot to spend.
- It's murder, Myrt.
Our husbands swiped $86,000 from the Rockville National Bank this morning and we can't even buy a lemonade.
$86,000?
Fingers, that dough belongs to us.
We swiped it.
Yeah, it's the missing loot.
Listen.
Like you said, Shirl, it's murder.
Staying home while our husbands are on the lam.
If we could use that loot, we could buy a real snazzy pad.
Yeah, instead of that broken-down joint we're hiding out in.
Come on, Shirl, let's go home and count it again.
Back to 345 Stone Cave Road.
- Did you hear that?
- Certainly.
- What will we do, Fingers?
- Well, that's easy.
We pays a visit to 345 Stone Cave Road and collect the stolen money from them crooks.
Holy macaroli, the dough!
- What about it, Fred?
- You left it at my house.
So what?
We can't spend it out here in the woods.
Don't you get it?
If the police search the house - they'll find it.
- So what?
They can't spend it either, Fred.
But they can lock up Wilma and Betty as accomplices.
Oh, boy, have you got a knack for getting me in trouble.
Come on, back to the house before the cops get there.
- Do you think your plan worked, Wilma?
- I'm not sure, Betty.
But every shady character in town knows we have the stolen money.
I'm hoping the real crooks will come here to get it.
There's a car with its lights out coming up the street.
Maybe it's them.
Call the police, quick.
Operator, send the police to 345 Stone Cave Road.
So far so good.
No cop's spotted us.
Now you go inside and get the dough, I'll stay out here and watch for the police.
Got you, Fred.
- Here he comes, Betty.
- Hi, Betty.
Wilma, that's no crook, it's Barney.
It is Barney.
Help me get him to the couch, Betty.
Come on, Barney, snap out of it.
Wake up.
Speak to me, honey.
Say something.
Eight ball in the corner pocket, Fred.
Betty, Wilma, what happened?
Never mind, Barney.
What are you doing back here?
I've come for the money.
Fred said we've got to hide it in a safe place.
I'll get it, Barney, but we're turning it over to the police.
They're on their way here now and you and Fred are going to tell them the whole story.
Here's the money, Barney.
I'll be glad to get rid of it.
That's good, lady.
And we'll be glad to take it.
- It's the crooks.
- Some nerve.
Their husbands take the credit for a job we knock off, and they call us crooks.
I knew they was robbers, but I didn't think they was dishonest.
Okay, lady, hand over the dough.
Boy, that Barney.
What's he doing in there so long, counting the money?
The police.
We're sunk.
I got them all tied up like you said, Fingers.
What should I do now?
Just leave them there and let's scram.
- Thank you kindly for minding our loot.
- Don't mention it.
Hey, Barney, come on.
The police are coming.
Don't you think we should count the dough, Fingers?
Later, Benny.
So long, suckers!
Barney, shake a leg!
We're surrounded by cops!
What's the matter with you guys?
This ain't no time to be playing cowboys and Indians.
- Where's the dough?
- Right behind you, Fred.
And that's how it happened, fellows.
When I saw my dear wife and my best friends in mortal danger I sort of went berserk.
Without regard to my personal safety I rushed in, and with just one hand - I knocked out both crooks.
- That took a lot of courage, Mr. Flintstone.
Don't be so formal, sonny.
Call me what my friends call me: "hero".
- Oh, brother.
- I can't take any more of this.
You called, my dear?
- May we see you for a moment?
- Certainly, my love.
Will you gentlemen of the press excuse me?
But don't leave yet.
I got a lot more to tell you.
All right, what's on your mind?
Those reporters are clamoring for me to come back.
Thanks for sparing a few seconds of your time, O hero of heroes.
Boy, what a story, Fred.
It's a good thing I was there.
I'd never recognize it.
Okay, so I colored it a bit.
It makes for better reading in the newspapers.
What about the reward, Fred?
I already told you.
I intend to be fair about it.
Good.
There are a few things I want to buy.
- Me, too.
- And so do I. Hello, Rockville Department Store?
This is Wilma Flintstone.
Send up all those dresses I looked at last week.
And some hats, Wilma.
Don't skip the hats.
And I need a new fishing pole.
Have some poles sent over, too.
Hold it!
What do you think you're doing?
There won't be any reward money left for me.
We'll be fair about it, Fred.
Oh, yeah?
You're not going to get away with this.
Either we get away with this or you don't get away with that story you're telling, Mr. Hero.
You mean you'd tell?
My wife?
My two best friends?
You couldn't.
I'd be the laughingstock of the neighborhood.
Now, as I was saying, besides the clothes, send up a new sewing machine.
- Yeah, and a new bowling ball.
- And some travel folders.
No, take it easy.
What do I get out of all this?
And give the bill to Mr. Flintstone.
Wilma, have a heart, will you?
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
- The tracks end at this tree.
- Which means what, Fred?
Search me.
We know snorks can't fly.
We can't climb trees very well, either.
Or is it either.
It's neither.
I was just passing by and thought I'd drop in.
It's the poachers.
Glad to see you.
He's not only smart, Fred, he's also heavy!
Rockhead and Quarry Cave Construction Company.
Who?
Just a minute.
Hey, Fred!
Telephone!
- Okay, Ed.
Be right there.
- It's a lady, Fred.
Thanks, Ed.
Hello.
Flintstone speaking.
Hi, Wilma.
Fred, could you pick up a few little things on the way home?
Half a dozen dodo eggs, instant pterodactyl soup 30 pounds of ribs.
Yeah, I know.
So long.
Thanks, Ed.
What does my wife do with her spare time?
Why ask me?
I got one of my own to worry about.
Give them clothes washers, dishwashers, disposals and you still have to "pick up a few things on the way home".
A good, good afternoon to you, Mrs. Stonehead.
How are you?
Just fine, thank you, Mr. Flintstone.
Junior, come on now, it's getting late.
Can I have just one more ride, mommy?
Can I?
Let me see now, a half dozen dodo eggs, instant pterodactyl soup - 30 pounds of - Hi, Fred good neighbor, esteemed friend and bosom buddy.
And don't forget, captain of the bowling team.
No, don't forget that.
- What'll it be, Mr. Rubble?
- 30 pounds of ribs.
- Why not?
- Make that two orders.
One for me.
Also, why not?
Hear you're going on your vacation, Barney.
Yep, first thing in the morning.
We're heading for the mountains.
We're leaving, too.
But you know where we're going.
- The beach?
- Yeah.
Same thing every year.
- You know Wilma and her suntan.
- Yeah.
Here you are, Mr. Rubble, 30 pounds of ribs.
Right on the nose.
- That'll be $3.55.
- $3.55?
Shall I wrap them?
At those prices, you should wrap them in gold leaf!
- Last week 30 pounds was $3.20.
- You remember?
You bet I do.
Cancel my order!
And his, too.
But, Fred Somebody's got to put his foot down sometime.
If you don't remember, this pirate will keep raising the prices every week.
It so happens I've got the memory of an elephant.
Would you like to try for a case of amnesia, Jumbo?
You wouldn't dare.
Did you get the number of that truck, Barney?
And get the names of some witnesses, too.
Boy, I'll sue him.
Betty ain't gonna like this.
She wanted ribs.
Mr. Flintstone!
Good gracious, what happened to him?
- He got run over by 30 pounds of ribs.
- Run over by ribs?
Junior, will you get off that thing?
Can I have one more ride, mommy?
Can I?
It makes sense, I tell you.
Instead of us going to the beach and you going to the mountains we'll combine and make it a business and pleasure trip.
That's what we'll do, a business and pleasure trip.
- You mean we get the business.
- And you get the pleasure.
Droll, very droll.
What's wrong with cooking outdoors over an open fire?
If you've got about two hours, I'll tell you.
You are funny tonight.
- Maybe we won't like hunting, Fred.
- What is the matter with you people?
What did our ancestors have that we haven't got?
Money.
You just said the magic word.
Because that clinches my case.
While we're having a vacation, we are also putting food on the table we're eliminating the middleman, namely, that wise guy butcher and we bring back our own ribs.
And speaking of money, just think of what we can do with the money we save.
- Maybe I can get that minkasaurus.
- We could use a new car.
And what's wrong with a new bowling ball for me?
I've been wanting a new rake for a long time.
What's the matter with me, am I out of my mind?
Yeah, golf clubs.
That's better!
It might serve them right if we did go.
It might cure the economy pinch I've been getting.
Okay, Fred, you talked me into it.
You'll eat it up.
The great outdoors, back to nature coming back to camp where the girls are cooking over an open fire.
Cooking over an open fire!
Okay, everybody hit the sack.
We want an early start.
- Like, how early?
- Like at 4:00 a.m. That's how early.
We hit the deck, and rise and shine, and all that stuff.
But why 4:00 a.m. Because you always get up early to go hunting.
- Why?
- How should I know why?
That's the rules.
- Boy, we asked for it.
- I know.
Let's see now, did I think of everything?
Barney, did you lock the back door?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Did you leave a note for the milkman?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Did you cancel the newspaper?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Barney?
- Yes, ma'am?
- Don't forget the turkey.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Bring her over to Mrs. Stonehead.
She's going to take care of her while we're gone.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll go see if Wilma and Fred are ready.
- Hi, Betty.
- Fred up yet?
Of course, you know Fred.
4:00 a.m. Hit the deck rise and shine, and all that stuff.
You can't blame Fred.
He was up half the night loading the trailer.
- But why 4:00 a.m. - You know what's wrong with you girls?
- You've lost that pioneer spirit.
- And with any luck, it'll stay lost.
Yeah, who needs it?
Hey, Fred.
Come on, ready for the take off!
Wake up.
- He's still asleep.
- Who's asleep?
I was just resting my eyes.
Let her go, Barney.
Start the countdown.
Five, four, three two, one.
Blast off!
- Here we go!
- Maybe we're overloaded.
Stop talking and give her the gun.
- Step on it, Barney.
- I am!
- Pour it on, Barney.
- I think she's starting to roll.
- We're off.
- Yippee!
A hunting we will go, Fred.
Right, Barney.
And we're leaving all our troubles behind us.
Don't look now, fellas, but you're being followed by a garage.
It's always nice to take a little bit of home with you wherever you go.
Don't you love these early starts when we go on a hunting trip?
Yeah.
Up and at 'em.
Rise and shine!
Hit the deck!
What's earlier than high noon the next day?
All right, wise guys.
I had to put the garage back, didn't I?
Anyway, once we hit that superhighway, we'll make up for lost time.
- Don't drive fast.
- Who drives fast?
There's the turnoff for the superhighway, Fred.
After we get on that, Barney next stop, the tall timber country.
- This is the way to travel, Barney.
- Right, Fred.
Straight through, no red lights, no stops just zoom along.
How about that?
Just as we're making time, we get behind one of those Sunday drivers.
- Yep.
Happens every time, Fred.
- Come on, let's move it!
Give it a honk, Fred.
Oh, boy!
- What's up, Fred?
Why are we stopping?
- Some smart aleck blocking the road.
Come on, let's go!
Okay, road hog, let's roll it.
All right, what's the problem?
This road hog up ahead won't move, Officer.
That's right.
As soon as we started blowing the horn - he deliberately stopped, just to be mean.
- Yes, ma'am.
There ought to be a law against these kind of people.
Blocking the road, causing accidents!
Yes, ma'am.
I'll take care of it, ma'am.
While you're at it, why don't you give him a ticket?
That'll teach him a lesson.
- Hey, Fred.
- Yeah, Barney?
- You know that trailer up ahead?
- Yeah.
- Who belongs to that trailer?
- Search me, Officer.
- We got one of our own to worry about.
- Hey, Fred.
- Barney, I'm talking to the officer.
- But, Fred.
- Where's your manners?
- But, Fred.
Our trailer's back there, Officer.
It's gone.
That trailer up in front looks like That's our trailer, Barney.
That's what I've been trying to tell you, Fred.
Faulty trailer hitch, obstructing traffic - creating a hazard.
What's your name?
- Flintstone.
How do you spell it?
F-a-t-h-e-a-d!
Come on, Fred, cheer up.
Yeah, Fred, we all get tickets.
Come on, Fred.
Don't let it spoil your vacation.
- I guess you're right.
- Look, Fred, up ahead tall timber country!
You're right, Barney.
Full speed ahead!
All right, everybody, now hear this.
While Barney's chopping wood, you girls set up camp.
- Meanwhile, I'll scout around for tracks.
- Sure.
Wanna bet he makes tracks for the nearest shady tree?
Timber!
Speaking of a shady tree, here comes one now.
- Yeah, and it's a big one.
- Barney, the trailer!
Fred, I just felled my first tree.
As soon as I get out from under here, I'm gonna fell my first neighbor.
Now, try to do something right for a change, will you?
Just give me a chance, Fred.
That's all I ask.
Okay.
While I start the fire, you go catch some fish for dinner.
Will do, chief.
Wait till you girls get a taste of fresh trout, cooked over an open fire.
- I hate cleaning fish.
- I hate fish.
Period.
- I don't think there's any fish in this lake.
- Any luck, Barney?
- Not yet, Fred.
- How's the fire coming?
Any minute, Barney.
Any minute.
It's no use, Fred.
They're just not biting.
Fire's ready, Barney.
Where's the fish?
How do you want it, Fred, broiled or fried?
- Turn over, Fred.
You're snoring.
- Okay, Wilma.
Hey, Fred!
- What's up, Barney?
- How can I get any sleep with you snoring?
Are you kidding?
I haven't slept a wink all night.
If we're going hunting, we might as well get an early start.
- Hey, Fred.
- Yeah, Barney?
- What are we after?
- We are after one of the big ones.
- A snorkasaurus, that's what we're after.
- Snorka-snooker?
What's that?
It is morning.
With the morning, the hunters.
And with the hunters, the chase.
What sport.
- Hey, Fred.
- Yeah, Barney?
What do we do if we come face to face with one of the big ones?
- What do we do?
- I asked you first.
Hand me that number five club.
Here you are, Fred.
The first thing I do is clobber him with the number five.
Like this.
No, not that way, you fool!
You've got to keep your head down.
Then follow through, like so.
Then if he gives you any trouble, you give him a knock with your number seven.
- Hand me the number seven club, Barn.
- Number seven, coming up.
Like so!
He's slicing to the left.
Or am I wrong, is it the right?
Then for the coup de grÃÂ¢ce, you tap him with this little club and there you have it, your snork is in the bag.
Then you might be left holding it, chum.
- Just one little question, Fred, if I may?
- Speak up, Barney-boy.
What's a snorkasaurus look like?
I wouldn't know one if I saw it.
Look, my friend, I will draw you a picture.
The head's kind of fat-like.
- Look who's talking about a fathead.
- And it's got a long, skinny neck.
A very bad likeness.
- Bad.
- Now, it's got a big round How are you?
Glad to see you.
Please go right ahead.
Don't mind little old me.
We're drawing a snorkasaurus, aren't we?
Of course we are.
Love it.
But we are making mistakes, aren't we?
Allow me, sir.
Thank you.
As I remember, a snorkasaurus is a large, handsome animal.
A regal head, more shape to the neck, well-proportioned body.
And, yes, the feet.
Large, but neat.
There we are, the snorkasaurus!
I am such a forgetful dunce.
One more thing, a snork makes a melodious sound, like so Snork.
You've been grand.
No, don't get up.
I'll find my way out.
Have fun.
- Who the heck was that?
- Never mind him, we're after a - Follow that snorkasaurus!
- Right, Fred.
Do you think the mighty hunters will bring anything back?
They'll be lucky to get back in time for lunch.
I knew it.
The camper's best friend, the mosquito.
- I can't stand them.
- That's why I like the beach.
- Your play.
- Gin!
Here he comes.
Yeah, I know.
Holy mackerella!
I hope they get back soon.
Everything's getting cold.
How cold can cold cuts get?
- Now what?
- Ants, what else?
The minute you set out any food, they zero in on you.
My game.
- Lf there's one thing I can't stand, it's ants.
- Same here.
At least they left an olive.
- There he goes, Barney!
- We got him surrounded, Fred.
- Are you following me?
- Yeah, but Who do you think you are?
- The king of the forest, or something?
- No, but Where's your hunting license?
Where?
That's what I thought.
A couple of poachers and lawbreakers, even.
I am taking you both in.
You, too, shorty.
About face.
To the game warden.
March!
Hup, two, three, four.
Hold it!
- What?
- After him, that's what!
A hideout for a creature in distress.
Help!
No, no, no!
Let me guess.
You're opera singers passing through.
What voices, what tone, what pizzicato!
- No, we're not opera singers.
- And you better keep passing through.
Or would you rather have a hit in the head with a frying pan, you beast!
No.
Beauties and the Beast.
What a title for a picture.
- It's been done.
- I have it!
But it can't be.
The Miss Universe contest.
Right here in these woods.
How original.
But where are the other lovelies?
But, of course, gone home defeated.
It had to be a tie.
Imagine two Miss Universes!
Thank you, ladies, for brightening my last hour.
- Lf I must go, at least I've seen everything.
- Go?
- Last hour?
- Yes, didn't you know?
There's a couple of sturdy hunters after me and when they catch me, it's the old one-two with the clubs!
- Here's his tracks.
- They're heading for the camp.
- Maybe he's got the girls cornered.
- It would serve him right, the poor sap.
Here they come.
I must leave thee, fair ladies.
I bruise easily.
- There he goes, Fred.
- We got him cornered.
It's Fred and Barney chasing that poor animal.
We've got to help him.
- The tracks end at this tree.
- Which means what, Fred?
Search me.
We know snorks can't fly.
We can't climb trees very well, either.
Or is it either?
It's neither!
I was just passing by and thought I'd drop in.
It's the poachers.
Glad to see you.
He's not only smart, Fred, he's also heavy!
Fred, don't you dare harm this charming, intelligent creature.
- And that goes double, Barney.
- How are you, ladies?
Glad to see you.
"Don't you dare harm this charming, intelligent creature," she says.
Yeah.
"And that goes double".
So the great hunters had to let him go.
Next thing you know she'll be wanting to take this charming, intelligent creature home as a pet!
My ears are burning.
Is someone talking about me?
Wilma, what's the big idea?
Fred, you said I could have a pet anytime I wanted one.
- This monster, a pet?
- No, sir.
I'm different.
I can cook, sew, iron, carry your bowling ball.
Just try me please, sir.
Just give me a chance.
Please, pretty please?
The Flintstones residence.
Mrs. Flintstone?
One moment, please.
It's for you, madame.
Thank you, Dino.
Hello?
Hi, Betty, how are you?
How's it going?
Yeah, I was just wondering how Fred and Dino were getting along.
You know Fred.
Now he's complaining about the high cost of pet food.
But take it from me, Betty it's great to have a snorkasaurus around the house.
You can say that again!
Come on, Wilma, open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
There she is, a genuine Stoneway.
Boy, that's just what I wanted.
I'll take it.
Can you deliver it tonight?
You're joshing me, bud.
I'm not.
It's got to be there when she wakes up in the morning.
Sorry, bud.
I can't move a piano by myself.
How's about your muscular little friend there giving you a hand.
Come here, my muscular little friend.
It's no use, Fred.
The piano is too fat for the door.
What do you mean, "too fat"?
Stand back while I throw a little weight on it.
But, Fred, you're a lot of weight.
- Fred.
- Yes, honey.
I must be dreaming.
A piano just went by.
Happy anniversary Happy anniversary Nothing here.
Wilma!
- Yes, Fred.
- Breakfast ready?
Almost.
I'll call you.
Happy anniversary Nothing here.
And nothing here, either.
I'll have to jiggle this boy's memory.
After all, your tenth anniversary comes only once in ten years and I don't intend to let it go by without a struggle.
- Your juice is ready, Fred.
- Be right with you, honey.
- Fred?
- Yeah.
I'll bet you don't know what day tomorrow is.
Sure I do.
Tomorrow is Thursday, followed by Friday as usual.
And to elaborate further on the subject today is Wednesday, preceded by Tuesday as usual.
And where is my breakfast as usual?
Here comes the toast Here comes the toast What do you know, heart-shaped toast.
Now, does that remind you of anything?
You mean tomorrow is St. Valentine's Day?
You're not even warm.
Does this thing on my head mean anything to you?
Don't tell me.
You either got a headache, or it's your dusting day.
I tried.
So long, honey, I'm late for work.
And take care of your headache.
I've been taking care of him for years.
Wilma!
I remember!
How could I forget such an important day?
- You remember?
- Sure.
Tomorrow is the day they collect the trash.
- Hello.
- Hi, Wilma.
- Hi, Betty.
- Did you win?
No, I'm glad I didn't bet on it.
I hit him with everything but rice and old shoes and he still didn't remember tomorrow is our anniversary.
Try the bridal veil routine.
That never misses.
- Wanna bet?
- It did?
- What now?
- Now what am I gonna do?
Simple.
Since I'm dressed for it, I might as well do some dusting.
Bye.
- Barney-boy, I was superb.
- I got to hand it to you, Fred.
Wilma hit me with everything except rice and old shoes trying to make me remember our anniversary.
- But I acted dumb.
- How could she tell the difference?
How would you like to be called Fat-lipped Barney?
Just kidding, Freddie.
What I want to know is how come you remembered your anniversary this year?
Easy, I never forget trash day and this year our wedding anniversary falls on trash day.
You always were lucky.
So, what are you going to get her?
- You know how it goes every year.
- Yeah, Wilma gets you a tie.
- Right.
And I always forget.
Right?
- Right.
- Then I run out and buy some flowers.
- Right.
And Wilma doesn't speak to me for two weeks.
Right.
Happens every year.
This year, I'm getting her something she's wanted for 10 years.
Yup, I am going all out.
- What is it, Fred?
I'm agoggles.
- Keep your shirt on, Barney-boy.
Here we are.
- What are you getting her in here, Fred?
- What do you think?
- Go ahead, take a little guess.
- I don't have to guess.
You're getting her this new album: - No.
Guess again.
- Don't tell me, Fred.
A xylophone?
I can't stand amateurs.
How thoughtful of you, Fred.
- No, Barney, not a xylophone.
- What's left, Fred?
Remember that $50 in prize money I got for winning the lodge bowling tournament?
- Yeah.
- I'm blowing the whole roll.
No, Fred.
Yeah, when Wilma opens her eyes tomorrow morning - the first thing she is going to see is this.
- A piano?
Fingers.
Now, let's not wrinkle the piano.
If it isn't Mr. Flintstone, the anniversary boy.
Don't forget now, tomorrow is trash day.
Never mind that.
I've decided to buy a piano.
Good.
Shall I wrap it up, or will you play it here?
Not so fast.
How do I know this piano is any good?
- Would you like to try an arpeggio?
- No, I have my heart set on a piano.
That sounds like a good one to me.
Yeah, 1 out of 88.
What does that prove?
Stop picking on the little fellow.
- Go ahead and play, Shorty.
- Thanks.
I'm a little rusty, though.
- Barney, if you're gonna play, play.
- He has to limber up, doesn't he?
Now let's see, how does that tune go?
Good, I know that one.
- Thank you.
- Not at all, carry on.
- Do you mind if I cut in?
- Be my guest.
Oh, boy.
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.
- All right, I'm convinced.
- Be quiet, we're coming to the finale.
Say, did you study with Professor Pesecare?
Five years.
I knew it.
I recognized your pianissimo.
Thank you.
Clever.
All right, knock it off!
- What are you, a music hater?
- No, I'm a piano purchaser.
I remember you, the anniversary boy.
Do you see anything you like?
- Yeah, the one you've been playing on.
- You have good taste.
- It's a genuine Stoneway.
- When can you deliver?
- It's your piano, when do you want it?
- Tonight, after my wife is asleep.
Aren't we sneaky!
- And when do we expect to pay for it?
- Right now.
Good, that'll be $1,500.
- $1,500?
- He's only got $50.
We have a nice piano stool in that price range.
Yeah, that's a good start, Fred.
Then you could buy the piano next year.
Are you kidding?
The anniversary is tomorrow.
Now, what will I do?
Why don't you forget it, like you do every year?
Cheer up, Fred.
You can buy a lot of flowers with that $50.
How about one of them big flower horseshoes - with "good luck" written on it?
- No.
I wanted something special.
Hey, bud.
- Did you call me?
- Yeah, come here a minute.
- You want to talk to me about something?
- Yeah.
You look like a pretty hot piano player to me.
- I play a little Chopsticks.
- That's what I thought.
How would you like to pick up a pretty hot piano?
- Sure, where's your store?
- I don't have no store.
- Where's the piano?
- Around the corner, in a truck.
I don't need a store.
No big overhead - no smart-aleck salesman.
- Yeah.
I even park the truck in the low-rent district and pass the savings on to you.
- That makes sense, Fred.
- Yeah, let's see the piano.
Sure.
Follow me, bud.
There she is, a genuine Stoneway.
Boy, that's just what I wanted.
How much?
How much were you thinking of spending, bud?
I don't think I can afford it.
All I got is $50.
By a strange coincidence that's exactly what I'm asking for this box.
You mean I can have it for $50?
Did you hear that, Barn?
Hold it.
Do you get a guarantee with it?
Certainly.
I guarantee it's a piano and when 88 Fingers Louie makes that guarantee he stands by it.
That's good enough for me.
I'll take it.
Can you deliver it tonight?
You're joshing me, bud.
I'm not.
It's got to be there when she wakes up in the morning.
Sorry, no dice, bud.
With me, it's strictly cash-and-carry.
Give me the cash, and you carry.
I can't move a piano by myself.
How's about your muscular little friend there - giving you a hand?
- Yeah.
- How about it, Barney?
- No, not me, Fred.
I'm not a piano mover.
Besides, I am too little and puny.
- Barney!
- And besides Come here, my muscular little friend.
Besides, I've been sick, Fred.
Honest.
What kind of a friend are you that won't help a neighbor with his wife's anniversary present?
Gee, I'm sorry, Fred, I'm ashamed of myself.
You should be.
Now hold steady while I back the car in under it.
Attaboy.
Easy now, let it down slow.
- Good.
Hang on, Barney.
- Right, Fred.
Just remember, watch those bumps.
I'll watch the bumps, you watch the piano.
Why don't you just come out and ask him?
What did you get me for our anniversary?
- You know we can't do that.
- Why not?
Because we're women, that's why.
Besides, you know the code: Make them think it's their own idea.
Yeah, and then if they forget we make them feel miserable for the rest of the year.
He might still remember, and that will surprise you.
And, listen, call me if he comes home with anything.
I won't be able to.
I'll be in a state of shock.
There goes Betty, heading back towards my house.
Good, now come on, don't let her see you.
Okay.
Now, let's take it from the top.
First, we hide the piano back at the garage, so Wilma can't see it.
- Right.
- Second I go into the house and play dumb.
And no cracks.
- Right.
- Third, after she's asleep you sneak the piano into the house.
- Right?
- Wrong.
You got me doing a solo, and I see it as more of a duet.
All right, I'll help you carry it in.
Now, remember, we meet here at midnight.
- "Aren't we sneaky"!
- Oh, boy.
- Wilma, I'm home.
- Fred.
What's that for?
Nothing.
I just wanted to see if you brought anything home with you.
- I did, honey.
- You did?
What?
An appetite like an elephant.
Too bad you don't have a memory like one.
It's after midnight and no Fred.
He must have overslept.
Fred.
I'll flip a pebble in there.
He'll thank me for waking him up.
Boy, what a sound sleeper.
I'll try something bigger.
I'm sorry about that rock, Fred.
Stop talking and start pushing.
I'm pushing, Fred.
I'm sorry again, Fred.
So help me, if you bust that piano It's okay, Fred, listen.
You pinhead.
Thanks, Fred.
That was a close one.
I promise, Fred, I'll be careful - and I won't make a sound.
- Good.
And I promise I'll never make the mistake of asking you for help again.
- But it's heavy, Fred.
- Whoever heard of a light piano.
Just don't drop it.
What happened?
Oh, no.
Don't worry, Fred, I know what to do.
Let's get on with it, Fred.
I gotta stop eating in those cheap restaurants.
- She all set, Barney?
- She's all set, Fred.
- Now keep it quiet.
- Right, Fred.
Heave.
Quiet!
Fred, is that you?
- What was that crash?
- It's nothing, honey.
You were just having a loud nightmare.
- Good night.
- Good night, darling.
- Barney.
- Yeah, Fred?
Quit your stalling.
We're taking it in through the front door.
Right.
I didn't mean to lie down on the job, Fred.
It's no use, Fred.
The piano is too fat for the door.
- What do you mean, "too fat"?
- It won't go through.
It's stuck.
Stuck?
Stand back while I throw a little weight on it.
But, Fred, you're a lot of weight.
- Fred.
- Yes, honey.
- I must be dreaming.
A piano just went by.
- A piano?
Why, it's merely a manifestation of your subconscious clashing with your conscious.
Which in turn is a logical outcrop for the possible childhood musical frustration coupled with the cucumbers you had for dinner.
Yeah.
- Good night, Fred.
- Good night, darling.
- What happened to you?
- I just got run over by a piano.
- Which way did it go?
- It went thataway.
Oh, no!
Hold it!
How do you stop this thing?
All right, pull over.
This time you slipped, 88 Fingers Louie.
- But I'm not 88 - Quiet, don't interrupt.
Sooner or later, a criminal always makes a mistake.
Imagine, driving a hot piano through a red light.
- But I wasn't driving a hot - With no tail lights, no head lights and no license.
You will get at least 20 years for this.
Have you got any last words?
All I wanted to do was surprise my wife on our wedding anniversary.
A likely story.
Wedding anniversary?
Jumping dinosaurs!
Today is my own wedding anniversary.
- Officer.
- Yes, sir.
Show 88 Fingers that the department has a heart.
- But I'm not 88 - Quiet!
Give this criminal a hand with his anniversary gift while I run out and get one for my own little bride.
How could I forget it, especially when it comes on trash day?
Fred, where have you been?
Where's the piano?
Hold it down.
- Is Wilma still sleeping?
- As far as I know.
Okay, boys, the coast is clear.
- And keep it quiet, will you, fellows?
- Yeah, right, keep it quiet Happy anniversary Happy anniversary Pour a cheerful toast and fill it Happy anniversary But be careful you don't spill it Happy Anniversary Happy Anniversary Happy Anniversary Fred, you remembered.
How could I ever forget the happiest day of my life?
Happy Anniversary Happy Anniversary Thanks, fellows, it sure was.
And happy he They're both as happy as can be Celebrating merrily their happy anniversary And I didn't forget you, darling.
- Happy anniversary.
- A tie.
With spots on it already.
Just what I always needed.
Oh, Fred.
Happy anniversary Happy anniversary All right, fellows.
I appreciate it, thanks.
Happy anniversary Happy anniversary We now state emphatically It's happy anniversary Not another day could be A happy anniversary Happy anniversary Happy anniversary Happy Anniversary!
All right, knock it off!
This is the most wonderful anniversary I ever had.
You mean up to now.
- Congratulations, ma'am.
- Thank you.
- Let's go, Louis.
- Louis?
That's not his name.
Yeah, we know.
They call him 88 Fingers, too.
But I tell you, I am not 88 Fingers.
What's all this 88 Fingers?
That's my husband.
- 88 Thumbs, maybe.
- Yeah.
- But 88 Fingers, never.
- Yeah.
Tell it to the sergeant.
Okay, boys, take the piano out.
- We'll need it as evidence.
- My piano.
Fred, why are they taking my anniversary present?
It's a long story, Wilma.
Barney will explain the whole thing to you.
- Right, pal?
- Right, pal.
- So long, Barney.
- So long, 88 Fingers Louis Fred.
I tell you, you're making a mistake, Officer.
The guy you're looking for is fat, dumpy, and kind of stupid looking.
And he's shorter.
He is shorter than I am.
Come on, 88, when are you going to learn crime don't pay?
Calling the wagon.
Come in, Car 11.
- Car 11, over.
- Arrest bulletin.
88 Fingers Louie has just been apprehended.
See, I told you.
88 has admitted the theft of a hot piano.
See, I told you.
Says he sold it to a fat, dumpy, stupid-looking guy.
Yeah, that's me!
- You see, I'm innocent, just like I told you.
- Okay, I guess you're clean.
Just remember, if you play with a hot piano - you'll get your fingers burned.
- Yeah.
All 88 of them.
- That's a joke, get it?
- Yeah.
- Fred.
- Hello, Barney.
- I explained everything to Wilma.
- You did?
What did she say, Barney?
- What did she say?
- Yeah, what did she say?
Nothing.
Boy, she stopped talking to me already.
- What are you going to do now?
- The same thing I do every year.
After it's too late, I run out and buy some flowers.
But next year, you know what I'm gonna do?
- What, Fred?
- The same thing.
Officer, wait!
Yeah, what's up?
- Do me a favor, will you?
- Like what, Mac?
Drop me off at the flower shop.
Wilma.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Keep your eye on this twirling object, Wilma.
You are getting sleepy.
You are asleep.
How about that, Betty?
She's sound asleep.
I did it!
That's wonderful, Fred!
You are a big dog, Wilma.
Now, bark.
No, a big one.
A big dog.
Wilma, I can't stand it.
Here comes the pitch.
And it's a high fly toward center field.
Rocky O'Toole is waiting for it.
Come on, Rocky, grab that ball!
It's coming down.
Rocky is under it, and he's - What happened?
- I don't know, Fred.
Starts acting up like that every once in a while.
- Did you check the tubes?
- Yup, they're okay.
- How's your antenna?
- Fine, Fred.
How's yours?
Very funny.
That's a real double-dandy yack-yack.
Now cut the clowning and let's check it, before we miss the whole game.
Sorry, Fred.
There's your trouble, Barney.
That nervy bird built a nest on your aerial.
Go on.
Go on home.
No, that ain't gonna do any good, Barney.
Here, I'll show you how to get rid of her.
Now watch this old bean ball.
Hey, Fred, you busted the aerial.
Anyway, I got rid of the bird.
Yeah, but how are we gonna watch the game?
Answer me that one, kid?
Very simple, wise guy.
We go over to my house.
And now, ladies and gentlemen it's a great pleasure to bring you Mesmo the world's greatest hypnotist.
It's a line drive to left field, and O'Toole is rounding first.
He's starting for second.
Come on, O'Toole, slide!
- Fred?
- Yeah, Wilma?
Will you kindly get off my lap?
Wilma, what are you doing here?
For your information, I was watching my favorite program The Great Mesmo.
Don't you think you're a little old to be sitting on Mommy's lap, Barney?
I'm sorry, Wilma.
I guess I didn't see you.
Well, you see me now.
And I'll thank you to put my program back on.
But, Wilma, Barney and I are watching the ball game.
We always watch the game on Saturday.
You know that.
Right, you watch the ball game at our house and we watch The Great Mesmo here.
That's the deal we made, isn't it?
Yeah, but If you like sports so much, Fred why don't you be one and stick to our deal?
But, me and Barney Come on, Barney.
Women always win when they appeal to a man's chivalry.
What gripes me is, I bet in the future people will think we cave men had it all our own way with women.
Turn it back to our channel, Wilma.
I don't want to miss any of the program.
- How about a sardine sandwich, Barney?
- Swell, Fred.
By the way, who's this Mesmo?
I never heard of him.
He's just some guy that's got a hypnotist act.
That sounds interesting.
So what's interesting?
Anyone can do it.
- Can you hypnotize anyone, Fred?
- Sure I could, Barney.
I never have because I'm reluctant to turn the full power of my brain on anybody.
Of course, my knowledge of science helps, too.
I didn't know you dabbled in science, Fred.
Dabble?
I wallow in it.
I don't show off like a lot of these college physicists but I got it up here.
After we finish this sardine, we'll watch this guy and I'll explain it to you, okay?
I'm with you, Fred.
I have on-stage another volunteer from the studio audience.
And I will now demonstrate how I put the subject to sleep.
You are getting sleepy.
Sleepy.
You cannot stay awake.
You're sleepy.
Sleepy.
Isn't that wonderful?
- How does he do it?
- I'll explain it.
His metaphysical dominates the subject, and Quiet, Fred, Mesmo is talking.
And now I will make the subject think he's a bird.
Hey, how about that, Fred?
He did it.
Look at that guy flap his wings.
That's nothing.
Just stuff you do at parties.
Fred, please be quiet.
You don't know anything about hypnotism.
I don't Really?
You never told Wilma about your power, Fred?
No, Wilma isn't of a scientifical turn of mind.
Yeah, I bet she'd be surprised if she knew, pal.
Barney, will you please be quiet?
Fred is just explaining how it's done, Betty.
Fred couldn't explain a can opener.
Now be considerate, and wait outside until our program is over.
You see, Barney?
Women close their eyes to the scientifical.
- Explain it to me, Fred.
- Sure.
It's this way, Barney.
Inside everyone's head there's a brain.
Like the saying goes, "He has a mind of his own".
I mean about the can opener, Fred.
And until next week I leave you with this metaphysical thought.
: Keep those box tops coming in.
Good afternoon, folks.
- Isn't he wonderful?
- I love that program.
And so, when an immovable force meets a removable object it's curtains, and like that.
How lucky can I get?
I got a friend that's a brain and shoots a good game of pool, too.
Okay, you scientists, you can watch your ball game.
Looks like Einstein got to the set first.
There we are, Barney.
Back to the old ball game.
And so concludes the most exciting ball game this season.
It was a dilly, and I know you sport fans enjoyed it.
Wilma, you made us miss the whole ball game on account of that amateur Mesmo.
What do you mean "amateur"?
He's a professional hypnotist.
Anybody can do what he did.
That's high school stuff.
Really?
You went to high school and you couldn't hypnotize a fly.
Yeah?
That's what you think.
I can so.
Okay, laugh.
But I could hypnotize you, Wilma if you're game to try it.
Okay, Svengali, I'll prove how wrong you are.
Wilma, go along with it.
We'll have some laughs.
Okay, but keep a straight face.
Come on, stop mumbling.
Are you game?
Yeah, Fred, I'm game.
Try and hypnotize me.
All right.
Now, let's see, how did he do it?
Keep your eye on this twirling object, Wilma.
You are getting sleepy.
Sleepy.
You are getting sleepy.
You can hardly stay awake.
You want to go to sleep.
You're drifting off, off into slumberland.
You can't stay awake any longer.
You are asleep.
How about that, Betty?
She's sound asleep.
I did it!
That's wonderful, Fred!
And now, I'm gonna make her bark like a dog.
A big dog.
You are a big dog, Wilma.
Now, bark.
No, a big one.
A big dog.
Wilma, I can't stand it.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry, Fred.
I hope I didn't hurt your feelings.
But let that be a lesson to you.
Don't fool around with hypnotism.
In the hands of an amateur, it could be dangerous, you know.
A big dog, yeah.
Very funny.
"In the hands of an amateur, it could be dangerous, you know".
What's the matter with you, Barney?
Come on, wake up.
That's a good gag, Barn.
Come on.
You had me fooled for a minute.
Come on, Barn, open your eyes.
That's better.
Now speak to me.
Quiet, Barney, the girls might hear you.
Fred, did you say something?
No, Wilma, whatever gave you that idea?
I thought I heard a dog bark.
Don't rub it in, Wilma.
Betty and I are going to the market, Fred.
We'll be back in an hour or so.
- Fine, good.
Take your time.
- All right, bye.
Oh, boy, they're gone.
Barney, pal, you gotta cut it out.
Come on, snap out of it.
Now he's playing dead dog.
Oh, boy, I must have hypnotized Barney instead of Wilma.
Look, don't worry, pal.
I'll get you out of it somehow.
Now let's try again before the girls get back.
Wake up, Barney.
Eureka.
Oh, no!
That was kind of a mean trick we played on Fred.
Yeah, but I hope it'll teach him a lesson.
Anyway, I'll fix a nice dinner and make it up to him.
3, 30 15 No, 14 22, 15, 11.
- That's 97.
- 97 cents, Mrs. Flintstone.
97 cents?
You buy a few extra steaks besides your week's groceries - and $1 is short.
- Isn't it the truth?
Come on, Barney, please snap out of it.
Boy, I can't do a thing with him.
He thinks he's a dog, and that's that.
I got it.
I'll take him to a doctor before the girls get back.
A doctor?
No, he needs a vet.
Come on, Barney-boy, we're going for a ride.
Down, boy.
Take it easy, now.
Down!
Coast is clear.
Okay, let's go, Barney.
Hold it, Barney.
Come on, Barn, you're going the wrong way!
All right, if you wanna play dog, go ahead.
But hurry it up, will you?
Good afternoon, Mr. Flintstone.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon, Mr. Rubble.
No, Barney, it's the mailman!
Stop it, Barney.
Sorry, Mr. Mailman.
It won't happen again.
I better stop eating in those cheap restaurants.
Stay put, Barney.
Stop jumping around from one side of the seat to the other.
Come on, Barney, it's for your own good.
I won't let him hurt you, honest.
I don't get it.
He's only been a dog for 20 minutes and he hates vets already.
- Mr. Flintstone?
- Yeah?
The doctor will see your pet now.
Mr. Flintstone says it's an emergency, Doctor.
Yes, indeed.
Let's not keep him waiting.
Now, yes, we'll take He looks healthy enough.
His nose is cold.
Nice color to his tongue.
That'll be $5, please.
$5?
You didn't do anything yet.
You're right, I didn't.
I remember.
You're the emergency.
Is that right?
Well, then, tell me all about it.
And don't keep anything back.
After all, I am your doctor, you know.
This is my best friend.
Say, that's well put.
A saying like that could catch on.
Best friend, man, dog.
Yes, I've got it.
A dog is a man's best friend.
That could really become big.
Real large.
But he's not a dog.
He's a human!
He's a Now, think of that.
With all the new breeds of dogs, it's getting harder to tell all the time.
Look, Doc, he has been hypnotized to think he's a dog.
Is that Are you sure?
It could be a new breed, you know.
I'm sure, Doc.
I hypnotized him.
Yeah, I see.
Why don't you leave him as he is?
There's nothing wrong with a nice dog.
Come on, Doc!
Are you gonna do something or not?
Yes, I'll be glad to.
This scientific dog-testing machine will test the degree of his canine instincts.
There, you see?
You can't fool science.
He's all dog.
- Where are you?
- Hey, Barney, wait.
Here, Barney.
Come back, boy.
Here, boy.
"A dog is a man's best friend".
Say, that is good.
I wish I had said that.
It'll probably catch on.
Here, Barney.
Here, boy.
Where are you, Barney?
Come on, boy.
Here, Barney.
Fetch the stick, boy.
That's a good boy.
Now bring it here.
That's a good fellow.
Now sit.
Got you.
Come on, Barney.
We'll find that guy Mesmo.
Maybe he can snap you out of it.
Heel, boy.
Crazy college kids.
We'll try the TV studio.
Maybe Mesmo is still there.
He's gone.
Hey, Barney, where are you?
Holy mackerel, they're taking him to the dog pound!
Mr. Dog Catcher, I want my friend back.
The dog catcher wagon just brought him in.
Has it got a license?
No, he hasn't got a license.
Well, that's why he was picked up.
Okay, buster, follow me.
I'll show you what the dragnet brought in.
They're all down there.
Can you see him?
Let's see, no There he is!
Oh, him.
Why, he jumped into a car and started a fight with another dog.
- You wanna take him with you now?
- No, he's safe here.
You keep him here until I get back.
I gotta see a man about a dog first.
Usher, please could you tell me where I can find Mesmo?
I gotta see him right away.
It's an emergency.
Mesmo's still here, Mac.
You'll find him in Studio C. Boy, what luck.
Thanks.
Here it is.
"The Great Mesmo".
We'll soon find out how great he is.
- Pardon me, Mr. Mesmo.
- Yes?
I wonder if you can help me out.
I'm in lots of trouble.
You'll have to wait your turn, sir.
Okay, lady.
Okay, lady, you are not a bird.
Return to normal.
- Where am I?
- You're at the studio, madam.
Now please go home.
Sir, now pay attention.
You are not a jumping bean.
Return to normal.
Hey, what happened?
My feet are tired.
You're okay, sir.
Go on home.
Now, then, what do you think you are?
- A bird, a cat, a frog?
- No, it's not me.
- It's my friend.
He thinks he's a dog.
- Where is he?
- At the dog pound.
- That figures.
What a day it's been.
The studio audience was extra-sensitive and half of them got hypnotized.
I've been two hours de-hypnotizing people.
And do you think my sponsors thank me?
They do not.
They talk about canceling my program.
If anyone at home was affected, imagine.
Barney was affected at my home, Mesmo.
Not so loud.
Sponsors have big ears, you know.
Take me to him, and we'll keep this to ourselves.
Just our little secret.
Okay, Mezz.
In a way, you're responsible.
Let's go.
Sure, I've seen your program, Mr. Mesmo.
But let me get this straight.
You wanna change a dog into a human, right?
To speed things up, yes, that's right.
Okay, try it.
- But I got $10 that says you can't do it.
- It's a bet.
Now which one is it, Mr. Flintstone?
There he is, the cute one.
The one sitting up in the corner.
Attention!
He's looking right at you, Mezz.
When I clap my hands, you are no longer a dog.
You are a human.
Hey, Fred, what happened?
What am I doing down here with all these mutts?
You did it, Mezz!
Barney ain't a dog no more.
Yeah, well, just keep it quiet.
Well, there they go.
That Mesmo is good, or it's a racket.
Either way, I'm out $10.
Hey, you with the funny hat.
Look down here.
We demand our release, Warden.
Yeah, I wanna see the public defender.
- I know my rights.
I wanna use the phone.
- Let us out, or I'll sue the city.
Oh, no, the dogs think they're human now.
What's he talking about?
There's no dogs around here.
It just isn't my day.
What happened, Fred?
What was I doing at the dog pound?
I'll explain later, Barney.
We gotta get home before the girls do.
Look who's coming, Betty.
It's Einstein and company.
Hello, Barney.
Where have you been?
- What have you scientists been up to?
- Up to?
Who, us?
What do you mean?
When it starts like that it's days before I find out the truth.
All right, Fred, let's go home.
Yeah, sure, Wilma.
Let me carry your packages.
Here, Barney.
You can carry this.
- So long, Wilma.
I'll call you after dinner.
- Okay, Betty.
Barney, just what did happen today?
I won't know until I check with Fred.
And, boy, have I got a lot of questions for that guy!
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
What'll it be, Mac?
- I'm looking for a private eye.
- Yeah?
Maybe you know him?
Perry Gunite?
Sure.
The daddy of them all.
There he is now.
Yes, sir, Mr. Gunite.
What'll it be?
Rocks over rocks.
Yoo-hoo.
Wilma, are you home?
Hi, Betty.
Just a minute.
I'll open the door.
Ta-da!
What's going on?
The Roller Derby?
Come on in.
I'm gonna try some figure eights.
I know, the hard way.
Two fours.
Look out, Wilma!
That's doing it the hard way all right.
What's this all about?
I was cleaning out the storage closet, and I found this box full of souvenirs.
Some of them go way back to Boulder High.
I was wearing these skates the first time I went out with Fred.
- We went roller skating.
- What's that picture?
It's Fred in uniform.
First-string catcher on the ball team.
That's me.
The one with the knobby knees.
I didn't think you were a fatso on the half-shell.
What's this, a poem?
"I love thee, Wilma With hair like silk "Lips like cherries Skin like milk "Your shell-like ears Your dainty hands "And eyes so black Like frying pans" Frying pans?
Oh, brother.
Fred wrote that when we were in high school.
At 16, that was beautiful.
I must show it to Fred.
He'll get a big kick out of it.
My goodness, it's 3:00.
I've got to run downtown to the jeweler's.
- The jeweler's?
- Fred's birthday is next week.
I'm buying him a watch.
And it's a big secret.
So whatever you do, don't tell Barney or he'll blab to Fred.
So long.
Frying pan eyes.
- What's up?
- You forgot the skates.
For goodness' sake.
And what do you want me to do with "Sonnet to Frying Pan Eyes"?
Let me have it.
I'll put it in the drawer till I get back.
Remember, not a word to Barney about Fred's present.
You know me.
Hear nothing, see nothing.
You forgot something.
Yeah.
This is the hard one for me.
Say nothing.
How's about a game of badminton later on, Fred?
Not tonight, Barney-boy.
I am gonna relax and watch TV.
Thanks for the lift, Barney.
See you in the morning.
Where do you think you're going?
You know I always take a shortcut through your kitchen.
Tonight you're making a detour.
You're detouring around the icebox.
But, Fred, I always have a little snack before dinner.
All right, if you want a snack in the snoot open that icebox, that's all.
Not even a little antipasto?
No antipasto!
That'll teach you a lesson, Fred.
You ought to put your toys away.
What birdbrain left this skate here?
Maybe one of the neighbors' kids?
Yeah.
They're always in here asking Wilma for handouts.
You know, I haven't been on skates since I was a kid.
And you'd better stop thinking like a kid and stay off them.
Are you kidding?
You think I can't skate?
I wouldn't say that, Fred, but Do you belong to some good hospital plan or something?
No, but keep that up, smart guy, and you'll need one.
- That's pretty good, Fred.
- I told you there was nothing to it.
- Let's face it.
You're a natural-born athlete.
- Yeah, I know.
- You're class, Fred.
- How about this one, Barney?
Champ, how's about letting me try them for a while?
Forget it.
I'm just starting to warm up.
Very fancy, Fred.
- Fred.
- Relax, Barney, I'm okay.
Didn't hurt a bit.
- I know.
Can I try the skates now?
- No, you can't "try the skates now".
- What's this?
- What's what, Fred?
Wait a minute, will you?
It's terrible.
Terrible.
Here.
Read this.
Let's see.
"I love thee, Wilma With hair like silk "Lips like cherries Skin like milk" "And eyes so black Like frying pans" You're right.
It is terrible.
Eyes like frying pans?
Couldn't you think of a better rhyme than that?
- Don't you understand?
I didn't write that.
- You didn't?
Do I look like the kind of a guy who'd write that kind of goop?
Not unless you're lovesick and you couldn't be as sick as this and live.
Then if you didn't write this That's it, Barney.
There's somebody else.
My Wilma.
I can't believe it.
- There now, take it easy.
- Why?
Where have I failed her?
- What did I do wrong?
- I don't know.
Maybe you was too ambitious to get ahead in the world.
- Maybe you ignored her.
- Yeah.
Leaving her alone every night while you travel around the world on your big business deals.
Yeah.
I didn't mean to ignore her.
What big business deals?
I guess I've been watching too many TV shows.
Funny.
I'm losing my wife and my best friend makes jokes.
That's why she's not home.
She's with him.
The goop writer.
If I ever lay my hands on him I'll choke him!
I'll bend his head!
It's me!
Barney!
Cut it out!
I'm sorry, Barney.
I didn't know what I was doing.
Maybe whoever it is worships Wilma from afar.
After all, Wilma's a very attractive woman.
Oh, yeah?
How do you know that?
I'm just married, not dead.
Could be some young squirt.
Like the delivery boy.
That's it.
An impressionable kid rejected by his mother.
Yeah.
How do you know he's been rejected by his mother?
I've seen the kid, he's gotta be.
Nice try, pal.
- Did you read the next stanza?
- Nope, but I'll take a look.
I see what you mean, Fred.
"And when you in my arms are in "My love how can you doubt?
"I quiver just like gelatin "And sometimes even break out" That don't sound like worship from afar.
That sounds like worship from very near to me.
Yeah.
- You know something else I found out?
- No, what?
- Once you learn it, you never forget it.
- What's that, Barney?
- Roller-skating.
- Yeah, I know.
What are you talking about?
Take those skates off, and get out of here!
Look, I'm leaving.
Good evening.
Fred!
Why are you sitting in the dark?
Some people spend all their married life in the dark.
You're mad because I'm late for dinner.
I'm waiting, wife mine.
Dinner will be ready in a minute.
Do you mind warmed-over cactus stew?
Never mind that.
Where were you?
Well - Well - You said that.
I ran into Betty downtown.
- Yeah?
- And we dropped into a movie.
Maybe you'd rather have some cold cuts for dinner instead?
- What movie did you see?
- What movie?
Yeah, the name of the picture.
All pictures have names.
Makes it easier when they hand out Academy Awards.
That's very funny, Fred.
You kill me.
First things first.
The name?
I don't know.
We came in the middle.
Oh, my, I forgot poor Dino's dinner.
Here, Dino.
Here, boy.
Here's a nice bone.
Okay, Dino's got his dinner.
So how come you're so late from seeing half a picture?
They had a double feature, and I didn't see the name of that one, either.
How can you come in the middle of both pictures?
- It ain't easy.
- Okay.
All right, forget it.
- I'm gonna talk to Barney.
- Good.
You run along.
I'll have dinner all fixed when you get back.
Oh, boy.
Hello, Fred.
I'm fixing Barney a TV snack.
Come on in.
- Betty, I wanna talk to you.
- Sure, Fred, what is it?
Get the phone, will you, Fred?
My hands are full.
Yeah.
Okay.
Hello, Betty?
Wilma.
Now look, don't talk, just listen.
You've got to back me up.
It's important.
I told Fred I was with you all afternoon at the movies.
So if he asks, be a doll, and follow through for me.
- Okay, Betty?
- Okay, Wilma.
- You got a cold?
- Yes, a cold.
Fred, can you get the phone for me?
I guess he's not back yet.
All right, I'm coming.
Hello.
Who?
This is Mr. Slagheap, the jeweler.
I'm calling about your husband's wristwatch.
The jeweler?
You shouldn't have called.
Suppose my husband answered the phone?
I'm terribly sorry, Mrs. Flintstone.
I'm just checking the inscription.
Now, that was: That's right, "darling".
Not "The only man I ever loved" "The only man I ever will love".
My own wife.
Don't worry, my dear.
I'll rush it so that you can have it tomorrow.
Thank you.
I know you have so many others waiting.
It's so kind of you to squeeze me in.
Oh, no.
My wife falling for a playboy.
It can't be true, Fred.
Wilma involved with a playboy?
Wilma's different.
She's different.
That's a wonderful quality about you, Barney.
Loyalty.
Pure blind loyalty.
Yeah, I know.
Maybe I should have married somebody like you.
It's too late, Fred.
I'm already married.
I didn't mean it that way, waterhead.
And another thing, stop defending Wilma.
I'm the innocent party, get on my side.
I am.
And on Wilma's side, too.
She ain't what it looks.
I feel it right here.
I heard it here.
And I know it here.
And when I find that playboy, he's gonna get it here.
Fred, watch it!
What's the matter with you, Fred?
We almost had a 7-car accident.
Who cares?
I do.
Watch it, will you?
- What're you gonna do here, Fred?
- I ain't gonna brush up on my cha-cha.
Okay, Barney, take over.
I'll see you later.
- But, Fred - Will you stop yakking and get going?
Okay, Fred, if you wanna be mysterious.
What'll it be, Mac?
- I'm looking for a private eye.
- Yeah?
Maybe you know him?
Perry Gunite?
Sure, the daddy of them all.
There he is now.
Yes, sir, Mr. Gunite.
What'll it be?
Rocks over rocks.
Yes, sir, coming right up.
- They don't come any tougher.
- Yeah.
- Bartender.
- Yes, sir?
Put that in a dirty glass.
Yes, sir.
You see what I mean?
Yeah.
How tough can you get?
Mr. Gunite, can I talk to you?
Business or pleasure?
What's your problem?
- I'm a married man, and I'm miserable.
- Figures.
Some goof's been writing sickening poetry to my wife.
Figures.
I gotta find out who it is.
You gotta take my case.
We can't talk here.
Come over to my office.
Yes, sir.
We're waiting for you.
I don't know what them private eyes got but if they ever put it up in bottles, they'll make a fortune.
There isn't much money in this private eye racket - it's the fringe benefits.
- Yeah.
Morning, Brigette.
Bonjour, Monsieur Boss.
- My secretary.
- It figures.
Great secretary.
When she first came to work for me, she was all thumbs.
She ain't all thumbs now.
- Now, you think there's another man?
- I don't think, I know.
He's been sending her icky stuff.
Like this.
- It's a shame.
A dirty shame.
- You bet.
- A shame I never learned to read.
- Yeah.
I'm not hiring a scholar.
I want you to find this guy.
All right, I'll take the case.
And you're gonna take it on the chin, buster.
Well, it's Knuckles Stickazora.
Listen, Knuckles, this town's not big enough for both of us.
I'm giving you 24 hours to get out of town.
Okay, boys, take care of him.
Remember, 24 hours.
I just can't believe that about Wilma.
No, sir, she's just not the type.
I know what I'll do.
I'll go back and talk Wilma out of it.
That's what I'll do.
Fred's gonna love this watch.
Especially the inscription.
That couldn't be Fred.
I better hide this, just in case.
Wilma, you home?
I think so.
- Wilma, I gotta talk to you right away.
- Sure, Barney, come on in.
Thanks, Wilma.
- What're you looking for?
- I'm looking for him.
Him?
What him?
There's no him around here.
Fred's out of his mind.
You've gotta leave him.
Fred?
But he's my husband.
- Exactly.
And he loves you.
- Sure.
And I love him.
- Then how could you?
- How could I what?
Wilma, Fred knows, and I know.
Tell me.
I'd like to join the club.
Wilma, please be serious.
My wife and my best friend.
As my Chinese compatriot says, "That's the way the egg rolls".
What'll I do?
There's only one way to handle a delicate situation like this.
- I'll tear him limb from limb.
- That's the way.
Where to?
To put a little snake in the grass into orbit.
- That's where to.
- Okay.
- How could you do such a thing to Fred?
- Do what to Fred?
Don't pretend.
I know how women are.
They all crave excitement, romance.
But not you, Wilma.
Call him, Wilma.
Tell him it was just one of those things.
Tell him that it's all over now.
Do it for Fred.
Wait a minute.
Who am I calling?
You know who.
The goop writer.
The skunk that wrote: "Shell-like ears Dainty hands "Eyes so black Like frying pans" That skunk was Fred.
- Fred?
- Yes, Fred.
He wrote it to me when we were in high school.
It was so long ago he must have forgotten he did it.
Wait till Fred finds out that the other man is himself.
I'm sticking around till he gets home.
We should have a load of laughs.
First thing I'm gonna do is punch him right in the nose.
Talking to me, sir?
- No, me.
Just step on it.
- Right, sir.
"To my darling, the only man I ever will love.
"From his Wilma".
I guess I'm just as cornball as Fred when it comes to writing poetry.
I think it's beautiful.
It'll get Fred right here.
- The watch.
It fell under the couch.
- I hope it didn't break.
Don't worry.
I see it, way in the back.
Wait a minute.
Why should I act primitive?
Barney's a sweet little guy even though I can't trust him.
After all, we're adults, civilized.
I'll wish them the best, and if the best man has won c'est la guerre.
I'll be cool, calm.
I'll even laugh.
Fred, I didn't expect you so early.
Good evening, my dear little wife.
Get out from under that couch, you homewrecker!
- It's no use hiding, you little lizard!
- Are you off your rocker?
Fred, I wanna talk to you.
Why talk?
Maybe you'd rather hear some poetry.
"Eyes so black Like frying pans" - You've got nothing to worry about.
- I know.
Not a thing, pal.
Silly old me.
I've been worrying my fool head off over this.
When was that taken?
This afternoon when you were supposed to be working.
Yes, and instead he was over here trying to get me to give up the author of that corny poetry who happens to be you.
- Me?
- Yes, you.
I've got a box full of that stuff.
Yeah.
You wrote it when you was in high school.
- I wrote it?
- You did.
You also wrote: "You're a perfect peach, my love "Together we're a pair" "You're sweet, you're nice "You're paradise "And all kind of stuff like that there" Yeah, I remember.
And even though you don't deserve it, here's your birthday present.
"To my darling "the only man I ever will love.
"From his Wilma".
Wilma, honey, I'm sorry.
I've been a jealous fool, a skunk, a nut.
Who's arguing with you, you big dope?
So long, you lovebirds.
- Will you ever forgive me?
- I don't know why I should.
Please, one more chance.
Before I do, if I do I wanna know one thing, Fred Flintstone.
What?
Anything.
Ask me.
Go ahead.
Ask me.
What?
Do I still have eyes as black as frying pans?
You sure do, honey.
You sure do.
Wilma.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
You'd better tell Wilma to hurry up, or we'll miss that plane.
She just got a long-distance call.
That's wonderful, Mother.
I'm so glad you're feeling better.
You'll come here and rest instead of me going there?
Fine, I'll see you next week.
- Bye, Mom.
- She's feeling better, Wilma?
Yes, isn't that wonderful?
I won't have to make the trip after all.
I'll call Fred right away and tell him the good news.
The poor dear.
He looked so sad this morning.
You think he'll cheer up when he finds out his mother-in-law is coming here instead?
Quiet, Barney.
That's not funny.
Mr. Boulder?
This is Wilma Flintstone.
Will you tell Fred I won't be going to visit my mother?
Why not?
He's away on a leave of absence.
No, ma'am, he wouldn't tell me.
All he said was that he'd be away from home for a few days.
Yeah, okay.
Bye.
That Fred!
This is Bedrock, county seat of Cobble Stone County 200 feet below sea level.
Population, 2,500.
It's an average town with average people.
We have our butcher, our baker our pizza-pie maker.
We have our bank.
And while some of us stay late to catch up on our work the lucky ones who get home early catch up on their chores like watering the lawn and trimming the hedge.
For most of us, the usual activities except for Fred Flintstone who has had a most unusual day with the worst yet to come.
Wilma, you're home!
How come, sweetheart?
You mean "battle-ax," don't you?
Battle-ax?
What are you talking about?
- Hello, Fred.
- Barney, my pal.
Pal!
What's the matter with you, Barn?
Of course you're my pal.
- Put it there, chum.
- Sure, Fred.
I've been waiting all day for that, pal.
- Where did you get that money?
- How could you treat Wilma like that?
- Why did you body-slam me on the street?
- I'm going home to Mother.
- You should be ashamed.
- Stand up and I'll let you have it again!
Say something.
Don't just lay there.
Poor Fred.
It all started this morning when Fred was about to leave for work, and Wilma was going to visit her mother.
It all seemed like an ordinary beginning to an ordinary day.
I've got to shove off for work, Wilma.
Have a good trip, and say hello to your mother for me.
I'm going to miss you.
I'll miss you, too, Fred.
But it'll only be for a couple of days.
Mother's had these spells before.
I still think I ought to drive you to the airport.
But, honey, you know how your boss grumbles if you're late for work.
And the plane doesn't leave for a couple of hours yet.
Besides, it's already settled.
Barney has the day off, and he and Betty will drive me down in plenty of time.
- Now go to work, Fred.
- Okay.
Goodbye, dear.
- Come home as soon as you can.
- I will, Fred.
Goodbye.
Good morning, Betty.
Are you awake yet?
Yes, Wilma.
We're just finishing breakfast.
Is it still okay to drive me to the airport?
I could take a taxi if it's gonna be a problem.
No problem, Wilma.
Barney and I would love to see you off.
Did Fred leave for work yet?
The old darling.
He hates the idea of my going.
I bet he does.
We'll leave in about an hour, okay?
Swell, and thanks, Betty.
So Fred went to his job at the gravel pits playing to standing room only, as usual the audience watching and appreciating each skillful move.
Okay, Fred, take her away!
It is said that everyone in the world has a double, a look-alike and Fred Flintstone is no exception because nearby, in the J.L. Gotrocks building is Fred Flintstone's double none other than J.L. Gotrocks himself: - Big business tycoon - Hello?
and head of the Gotrocks industrial empire.
How's the rock market today?
Up two points?
Good.
When I make a million, sell.
I'm not money-mad.
Hello?
Yes.
Build another factory.
Hello?
Okay, buy the steamship line.
Hello?
We'll need 200 more trucks.
Hello?
Merge with them and we'll get control.
Hold on, I've got another call.
Yes, I've got it.
No, I don't have to write it down.
I can remember.
You want me to bring home a pound of liver, a loaf of bread, and a dozen hair curlers.
Of course I won't forget.
I've got nothing else on my mind.
Battle-ax!
Hello?
Yes, sell.
Hello?
No, buy!
Hello?
Decisions!
That's all I do, make decisions.
Every day, the same thing.
I'm insulated from the world.
I know nothing of the humanities.
I don't know what's going on out there.
I've got to get away.
That's the answer.
I've got to mingle with the real people doing things I've heard about, but never seen.
Pinball machines, jukeboxes pastrami on rye bread.
I want to have some of the good things in life.
They'll never find me.
They'll search the Riviera, they'll scour the country clubs but they'll never think of looking for me out there.
It'll work.
But before I disappear, I'll leave them a message.
This is J.L. Speaking.
As of today, I am resigning.
Do not bother to look for me and tell my wife to buy her own liver and hair curlers.
Goodbye.
Now out the back way, and freedom!
I'm telling you, G.W. He's not here.
And I know he didn't come out.
- Maybe he left by the back door, F.M. - J.L. Would never do that.
Let's check the pterodactyl-phone.
Maybe he left a message.
That's an idea.
Here's a cracker.
Are there any messages?
"This is J.L. Speaking.
"As of today, I am resigning.
"Do not bother to look for me "and tell my wife to buy her own liver and hair curlers.
"Bye".
- J.L. Has flown the coop, G.W. - Oh, no, F.M. Without J.L. At the big meeting today, the whole Gotrocks empire could crash.
Even if word of this got out, it would be disaster.
Big deal!
Where can I get a cinchy job like this, at my age?
- What do we do, F.M. - Find him, that's what.
He's out there somewhere.
We'll check the Riviera, search the country clubs.
We'll call the yacht club.
We'll What is it, F.M. Come here a minute, G.W. Take a look at that.
- You'll never believe it.
- What is it, F.M.
That man in the gravel pit.
That's J.L. Gotrocks.
You're right!
What do you suppose he's doing in a gravel pit?
With his luck, he probably struck gold.
Come on, let's go down there and find out.
Hey, Mr. Gotrocks!
It's time for the big meeting.
You guys talking to me?
You've got a good sense of humor, boss.
You had us worried, until we spotted you on that overgrown rocking horse.
Yeah, boss, what are you doing?
Going in for dino polo?
Let's go back to the office now.
We all had a big laugh, Mr. Gotrocks.
You guys got rocks in your head.
I don't know nothing about a big meeting, and I'm not your boss.
My name is Fred Flintstone, and I work here at the gravel pit.
- Fred Flintstone?
- You mean you're not J.L. Gotrocks?
J.L. Gotrocks?
Are you kidding?
But you look just like him.
If I had J.L. Gotrocks' dough I wouldn't be scratching around in a gravel pit for a living.
That makes sense.
Amazing resemblance.
He could pass for Gotrocks anytime.
Yeah, that's right.
He could, couldn't he?
- Say, Flintstone.
- Yeah?
How would you like to make some extra dough?
Doing what?
We're in a jam.
J.L. Gotrocks has disappeared, vanished.
And there's this big meeting today, see?
If J.L. Doesn't show up, the company will go bankrupt.
Hundreds of people will be out of work.
Widows and babies will lose their life's savings.
- The whole country could go broke.
- And, besides, we'd lose our cinchy jobs.
If that's the case, there's only one thing to do.
- Yes?
- You guys better find that guy Gotrocks.
No, we want you to take Gotrocks' place till we find him.
Who, me?
Go on.
I couldn't do that.
But you've got to.
- Think of those people out of work.
- Think of those widows and babies.
Think of our cinchy jobs.
You'll be doing a great thing for humanity and our country.
Okay, if it's a national emergency.
But I can only do it for a couple of days while my wife is out of town.
That's perfect.
You may not get home for a couple of nights.
You check out with your boss, then come up to the office.
All right, I'll ask him.
I'd like to have a couple of days leave of absence, boss.
You know we don't like to have the dinosaur idle.
- Is it important?
- Yeah, it is.
I can't tell you the reason.
It's sort of hush-hush.
I'll even be away from home for a few days.
If it's some kind of emergency, go ahead, Flintstone.
Thank you, boss.
That Mr. Boulder.
What a real swell guy.
You'd better tell Wilma to hurry up, or we'll miss that plane.
She just got a long-distance call.
That's wonderful, Mother.
I'm so glad you're feeling better.
You'll come here and rest instead of me going there?
Fine, I'll see you next week.
- Bye, Mom.
- She's feeling better, Wilma?
Yes, isn't that wonderful?
I won't have to make the trip after all.
I'll call Fred right away and tell him the good news.
The poor dear.
He looked so sad this morning.
You think he'll cheer up when he finds out his mother-in-law is coming here instead?
Quiet, Barney.
That's not funny.
Mr. Boulder?
This is Wilma Flintstone.
Will you tell Fred I won't be going to visit my mother?
Why not?
He's away on a leave of absence.
No, ma'am, he wouldn't tell me.
All he said was that he'd be away from home for a few days.
Yeah, okay.
Bye.
That Fred!
What's the matter, Wilma?
The minute my back is turned, he's got something cooking doing who knows what.
Wilma, Fred isn't the type of guy who'd do who knows what.
No?
Fred just took a leave of absence from his job.
He wouldn't tell his boss anything about it except that he won't be living at home for a few days.
Men!
So I'm a man.
What can I do about it, resign?
I'm going to search this town and find that Fred, and when I do I'm going to teach him he can't get away with it.
I'll go with you, Wilma.
I'd better go, too, and find out what this is all about.
Oh, boy.
Fred Flintstone, the big business tycoon.
If Wilma could only see me now.
I still can't believe anybody would take me for the great J.L. Gotrocks.
- Good morning, Mr. Gotrocks.
- Good morning.
He did it!
The great Mr. Gotrocks said good morning to me.
I knew it would happen one day!
I've got to call Mabel and tell her!
Here's the big test.
If the people in the office think I'm Gotrocks, I'm in.
Good morning, Mr. Gotrocks.
What do you know?
They all think I'm J.L. Gotrocks.
Of course, you look just like him.
Now let's get on with the big meeting.
Wait a minute.
I don't know anything about conducting a business meeting.
You don't have to know anything.
All you've got to say is: "Whose baby is that?
What's your angle"?
And "I'll buy that".
Whose baby is that?
What's your angle?
I'll buy that.
That's it, great.
Old J.L. Couldn't do better himself.
Let's go.
Gentlemen, the meeting will now come to order.
Let's hear from Mr. Stonehead first.
I'd like to open the discussion on the subject of the railway bonds in question.
- Whose baby is that?
- Mine, sir.
What's your angle?
I've completed some research and found the debentures are nil and the percentage yield is adequate.
I would advise pro rata distribution.
- I'll buy that.
- Thank you, sir.
What an executive Gotrocks is.
Knows what it's all about.
No one like him.
You're doing great, Flintstone.
Keep it up.
Whose baby is that?
What's your angle?
I'll buy that.
Oh, boy.
This is living.
Nobody knows where I am.
No decisions to make.
Rat, this machine!
Come on, get in there.
Hey, Flintstone, you know better than to tilt the machine.
- How much does the machine cost?
- $200.
Here, $200.
I'm used to having my own way.
$200.
From Fred Flintstone?
And my name's not Fred Flintstone.
Anyway, a couple of people have seen Fred around.
Yes, but they said he passed right by without saying hello.
That doesn't sound like Fred.
He would never pass anyone without saying hello.
How do you like that?
He tried to bluff his way right past us.
Yeah, as if he didn't see us.
Hey, Fred, wait a minute.
It's me, Barney.
Hold it, Fred.
He disappeared.
There's only one thing to do.
Since we know he's around here someplace, let's separate and look for him.
Good idea, Wilma, and whoever finds him will call the others.
If I find him, you can call an ambulance.
Let's go.
Yeah, Mrs. Flintstone, Fred was in here earlier.
He bowled a few games and flashed a roll of big bills and wanted to tip everybody in the place.
I tried to get him to go home, but he said he'd never go home to that Begging your pardon, ma'am, "Battle-ax" is what he said.
Battle-ax?
Wait till I get my hands on him.
One more thing.
He also mentioned liver and hair curlers.
I have a few things to mention to him, too.
Mister, can I speak to you a minute, please?
Make it snappy, lady.
I'm in the middle of a run.
Have you seen Fred Flintstone around here?
Flintstone?
You betcha, lady.
Old Fred gave me a good payday today.
He usually shoots a sharp game of pool.
But today, nothing.
He'll never miss it, though.
He had a roll of bills that would choke a dinosaur.
"A roll of bills that would choke a dinosaur"?
Now, where would Fred get that kind of money?
Any luck, Betty?
No, I haven't seen him, but he's been around.
He's been flashing a big roll of bills and acting like a bigshot.
I get the same story.
But I can't figure out where he got the money.
He couldn't have saved that much out of his lunch allowance.
There's something fishy going on.
Let's find Barney.
Maybe he's seen Fred someplace.
I've looked in all the usual places Fred hangs out, but no luck.
Now I'll start looking in the unusual places.
Boy, do I dig this way-out music.
Let's see, I'll try Number 14 this time.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
- Who, me?
- Yeah, you.
Worrying your poor wife like that.
Shame on you.
That battle-ax wouldn't worry about anything.
Battle-ax?
Yes, and for the first time in my life, I'm enjoying myself.
No nagging, no phone calls, no decisions to make.
I am never going back.
- But how about Wilma?
- Who's Wilma?
- And, for that matter, who are you?
- Who am I?
- I'm your best friend, Barney Rubble.
- Never heard of you.
- You're kidding, Fred.
- The name's not Fred.
Now why don't you just run along like a good guy?
Nothing doing, Fred.
You're coming home with me.
Hey, let go of my arm.
Don't fight it, Fred.
It'll be tough on your arm.
This is an old commando hold.
Hey, Wilma, look who I found!
- He's got Fred with him.
- "Old battle-ax"?
I'll show him.
Fred Flintstone, what have you been up to?
The minute you think I'm out of sight, you start playing around.
I'm not going to make a scene here on the street but wait till I get you home.
You'll explain everything including all that money you've been flashing around.
Now march!
Madam, you are completely off your rocker and I am getting out of here.
Of all the nerve!
After him, Barney.
Don't let him get away.
Hold it, Fred.
Now let's talk this over a minute.
Come on, be sensible.
- Let's shake hands and stop this nonsense.
- Okay.
"Just an old commando hold, Fred".
We saw that, Barney.
- Are you all right, honey?
- Of course.
How could getting slammed on the ground hurt anyone?
That's about as mean a trick as anyone can play.
What's got into Fred?
Whose baby is that?
What's your angle?
I'll buy that.
Flintstone is doing a great job, G.W. Lucky we found him, or we'd be ruined.
Hey, I can't take much more of this.
Did you find Gotrocks yet?
- Not yet, but we'll have him back soon.
- Keep going, Flintstone.
Okay, but you'd better find him soon.
What's your buy?
Whose angle is that?
I'll buy that, baby.
Who's your baby?
I mean I'll angle that buy.
Buy No I've had it!
I'm through!
I'm going back to the peace and quiet of the gravel pits.
No, Flintstone, you can't let us down.
Look, I went to that meeting to save widows and orphans but I'm not making a career of this.
I'm through, I tell you!
- Oh, my gosh!
There goes my cinchy job.
- What do we do, F.M.
We gotta keep him here, that's what.
Just a minute, Flintstone!
You can't do this to us.
- Who says?
- I do.
- Grab him, G.W. - I'm resigning, and that's final.
- Don't let him get away!
- After him!
Good day, Mr. Gotrocks.
All these bigshots are the same.
They never take time to stop and chat with the help.
Everything is rush, rush, rush.
Wait a minute, Fred.
You can't run away like this.
Wilma wants to know about that big roll of bills.
Why did I ever leave the office?
I thought it would be different on the outside.
Maybe I can shake him by hiding under this bridge.
Give up, Flintstone!
You're coming back to the office, even if we have to drag you back!
Oh, boy.
I should never have left the gravel pit.
No sign of him.
Looks like I lost him, all right.
He ducked under the bridge.
Get him!
Looks like he got away again.
Hold it, Flintstone!
You can't get away with it!
You're only making it tough on yourself.
- Now who are those two?
- I don't know but it could be Fred's been giving bodyslams to a lot of people today.
- I have had it.
- Me, too.
He'll have to come home some time.
I'll wait for him at the house.
I'll wait with you, Wilma.
I wanna shake hands with my pal again.
Boy, I'm getting pooped.
I gotta hide somewhere.
The ash can, that's it.
Get away from here.
Go find your own ash can.
- I think he went around this corner.
- Pardon me.
You idiot!
Got you, Flintstone!
Come on G.W. Give me a hand with this can.
Let me out of here.
Let me out, I demand it!
Sure, Flintstone.
As soon as we get you back to the office.
And now back to work eh, Flintstone?
It's J.L. He's trying to say something.
What are you trying to say to us your loyal employees, Mr. Gotrocks?
You're fired!
F-R-l-D, fired!
Out!
I finally got rid of those two guys.
I'll go home and call Wilma at her mother's.
Boy, what a story I've got to tell her.
Wilma, you're home!
How come, sweetheart?
You mean "battle-ax," don't you?
Battle-ax?
What are you talking about?
- Hello, Fred.
- Barney, my pal.
Pal!
What's the matter with you, Barn?
Of course you're my pal.
- Put it there, chum.
- Sure, Fred.
I've been waiting all day for that, pal.
- Where did you get that money?
- How could you treat Wilma like that?
Why did you body-slam me in the street?
- Why did you want a few days off?
- Poor Wilma's all broken up.
Why did you buy a pinball machine?
- I'm going home to Mother.
- Get yourself another bowling partner.
And so ends a typical mixed-up day in the mixed-up life of poor, mixed-up, Fred Flintstone.
Come on, Wilma, open this door!
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Pretty swell of the sergeant to tip us off about the secret mission.
We've got to remember not to talk to anyone about it.
It's a top secret.
That should be easy.
We don't know anything about it.
And now, gentlemen, we shall conduct a series of experiments to test your reactions under certain peculiar conditions.
In this first experiment, we will test your reaction to gravity.
How are we doing?
I will tell you in just a moment.
Reaction to gravity: Normal.
And here is the insurance policy you and your husband ordered, Mrs. Flintstone.
It goes into effect as soon as Mr. Flintstone takes his physical examination.
I see.
Where does he take the examination?
At the medical building.
57 Main Street.
Fine.
I'll see that he gets down there right away.
Thank you for dropping it off, Mr. Mortar.
You're welcome, Mrs. Flintstone.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mrs. Rubble.
- Goodbye, Mr. Mortar.
What's all that fine chipping on the bottom?
That's on all insurance policies.
Like, it pays double if a frozen pizza pie falls on your head and like that.
How did you ever talk Fred into taking out insurance?
I didn't call it insurance, that would suggest Fred wasn't immortal.
I told him the company was searching for a perfect physical specimen and all the contestants had to take out a policy to enter the contest.
That's pretty good.
I wonder if it would work with Barney?
You know what he said the last time we talked about insurance?
- No, what?
- He said he wasn't setting it up for some second husband of mine to paint the town.
Especially after he bought the paint.
Men.
I guess no woman really understands them.
No, but it's fun trying.
Okay, Fred, let her go!
Right, Charlie.
Sorry, Charlie.
It's okay, Fred.
No harm done.
Lucky you had your safety helmet on.
Rockhead & Quarry Cave Construction Company.
Who?
Fred Flintstone?
Yeah, hold the line.
Fred, it's for you!
- Your wife!
- Be right there.
Going up.
Thanks.
Flintstone speaking.
What's up, Wilma?
The guy was there about the contest, the insurance company?
The physical?
Why bother?
They can see I'm in perfect health.
One of the rules, huh?
All right, where do I go?
Betty, where did Mr. Mortar say Fred was to go for his physical?
Some place on Main Street.
I think he said the number was 75.
75 Main Street, Fred.
Why don't you drop by there on the way home?
Now, don't get panicky, Fred.
Stop worrying.
I tell you, there's nothing to worry about.
Yes, I will.
Okay.
Cross my heart, I promise I'll keep your dinner hot for you.
I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
From the way he carried on I thought I'd have to bring it to the gravel pit.
Barney is driving today, so you'd better keep his dinner warm, too.
Say, Wilma, I'm not sure of that number on Main Street.
75 Main Street sounds right.
Besides, he knows enough to check the phone book if we gave him the wrong address.
Sure is nice of you to drive me down to Main Street, Barney.
Think nothing of it.
My pleasure.
How come you're getting a physical, Fred?
It's one of the rules in the contest I'm in.
I'd suggest you get in the contest, too, but you wouldn't have a chance.
You're over the hill athletically.
Your reflexes don't flex anymore.
What are you talking about?
I'm as flexy as I ever was.
It's nothing to be ashamed of, Barney-boy.
Some guys retain youthful muscle tone, like me and others get all spongy, like you.
I'm going to enter that contest, and I bet I'll beat you.
That's okay with me, Barney-boy.
Just don't whimper when you lose.
This is Main Street.
What number were you looking for?
75.
There it is.
Down the street.
- Look at all the guys!
- That's to be expected, it's a big contest.
But those guys don't stand a chance.
Is this the line for the physicals?
- Yeah, this is it.
- We're all set, Barney.
All right, you men, step inside.
Sure, mister, we'll be happy to give you a physical.
That's why we're here.
My friend would like to get in this thing, too.
Fine.
The more the merrier.
Just sign on the dotted line, and you're both in.
I'll sign first.
- There you are, bud.
- Good.
Now your friend.
Here's the pen, Barn.
- Anything else?
- Only the physical.
Doc, I've got a couple of greenhorns for you.
Okay, I'll take the big flabby one first.
The big flabby one!
That's you, Fred.
Then I'll take the little spongy one.
That's you, Barney.
- How am I doing, Doc?
- So far, so good.
We'll try your reflexes next.
Look, it's moving.
Reflexes: Normal.
Okay, next.
- Like this, Doc?
- Yeah, that's fine.
There's always one in every crowd.
How long does this keep up?
We've got to get home.
Yeah, I'm getting hungry.
A couple of more recruits?
Step right up, fellows.
We'll GI you right now.
One for you and one for you.
Welcome to the Army!
The Army?
What's he talking about?
I don't know, but I'm not sticking around to find out.
Let's get out of here.
Watch it, that thing is sharp.
Congratulations, men.
You've just broken the record for going over the hill.
Three minutes and 23 seconds after joining the Army.
You don't understand.
This whole thing is a big mistake.
It looks like we made the mistake in thinking we can make soldiers out of you in three short years.
Three years!
Are you kidding?
My wife wouldn't stand for it.
- I demand to go home right now.
- Certainly.
Sergeant, show these men to their new home.
Yes, sir.
Come on, you guys.
Hello, Wilma?
Fred.
- Guess where I am?
- I know where you're not and that's home, where you should be.
I got some news for you, honey.
Listen.
Barney and I just joined the Army.
It sounded like you said Barney and you joined the Army.
Now, let's have it again, Fred.
Barney and I just joined the Army for three years.
You and Barney joined the Army for three years?
Don't expect me to keep your dinner hot that long.
But it's not like I won't be home again.
Barney and I got a three-hour pass for tonight.
Three whole hours?
I'll explain it to you when I see you, Wilma.
Goodbye.
You couldn't explain it to me in three years, and I'm in it.
This is all Wilma's fault.
She told me to go to 75 Main Street for a physical checkup.
Guess they're not home.
You'd think they'd be here.
We've only got a little time.
We thought you'd appreciate a military homecoming.
Very funny.
Only we wouldn't be in the Army if it wasn't for you two.
What?
Do you mean to tell me I told you to join the Army?
You told me to go to 75 Main Street and take a physical.
75 Main Street is the Army recruiting office and they give physicals there.
Didn't you tell me 75?
Maybe it was 57.
All I know is it's Fred's fault.
What do you mean, my fault?
It's Wilma's fault.
- It's Betty's fault.
- It's your fault.
Wait a minute, let's do that over again.
And I'll start it this time.
Why bother?
What's done is done.
It's no use crying over spilt milk.
Cry over spilt milk?
There's spilt milk.
I laugh at spilt milk.
But this army thing I can't laugh off.
Fred, we've got to get going.
It's a long way back to the camp.
I don't want you to go, Barney.
Don't feel bad, honey, it's not like it's forever.
I'll be home in three years.
Yeah, the three years will go pretty fast.
They will not.
I'll miss you.
I'll get it.
Fred Flintstone speaking.
That's it, Fred.
We've got to go.
They sure keep track of a guy in this man's army.
- Goodbye, Wilma.
- Bye, Betty.
- We'll write to you every day.
- Me, too, Betty.
How do they always manage to bollix things up, Betty?
I don't know, Wilma.
Practice, I guess.
Company, attention!
Forward march!
Hup, two, three, four.
Hey, fatso, stick that chest out!
Swing those arms.
To the rear, march!
We've been marching for two weeks now, but we don't get no place.
Yeah, all I get is beat feet.
On the double!
March!
My feet are killing me.
Feet?
Mine are so numb I forgot I had them.
Company, halt!
Okay, men, take a ten-second break.
- I can't take it, Fred.
- Me neither.
Look at my foot.
Blisters on top of the blisters.
Barney, let's play this thing smart and ditch all this marching stuff.
How?
I heard they're reactivating a cavalry company and they're looking for guys who can ride.
- But I don't know how to ride, Fred.
- I don't either.
But we've got three years to learn.
And in his letter Fred said he and Barney were promoted to the cavalry.
Barney wrote to me about it, too.
I can just see them now they and their mounts galloping along as one.
Like poetry in motion.
Barney, how do you stop this thing?
Just yell "whoa"!
That does it!
- Are you all right, Fred?
- Yeah.
But we're transferring out of this cavalry right now.
Let's talk to that new sergeant.
He's a pretty nice guy.
The professor's project, Man Into Space, is at a standstill because you, Sergeant, have not come up with two volunteers yet.
Yeah, already the spaceship is getting kaput.
But General, sir, I asked the fellows casually, you know without revealing the secret and to a man, there's a singular lack of enthusiasm for being shot into outer space, sir.
We have to face up to it, sir.
The spirit of adventure is dead.
It ended with you, sir.
An officer not afraid to lead.
An officer and a gentleman who would never allow a man to do anything he wouldn't do first.
With the look of eagles in your eyes, sir the first one-star general ever to go into orbit.
Just think of it, sir.
Gosh.
Into orbit?
Are you out of your cotton-picking mind?
I'm in charge of this space megillah, and those in charge never go.
I've noticed that, sir, so I'll ask the men again.
"Ask the men".
This new army bugs me.
We used to tell the men, and that's what I'm doing.
You get two volunteers today, or you're going to volunteer if I have to strap you in the capsule myself.
And don't give me any bushwah about regulations.
There are a lot of ex-Gls who'd erect a statue to anyone who put a top sergeant into orbit.
Now, where could I get two guys naive enough to volunteer?
Mr. Sergeant, could we see you a minute?
Yeah, we want to transfer out of the cavalry.
Transfer out of the cavalry?
Come on in, fellows.
This is your lucky day.
I've got just the thing for you.
It's a secret mission.
Never know who's listening.
It's so secret I can't even tell you about it.
All I can tell you is that compared to the cavalry this assignment is out of this world.
That's good enough for us.
We volunteer.
Good.
Report to Professor Van Pebbleschmidt and tell him you're the pigeons Volunteers he asked for.
The general will be so proud of me.
Maybe I'll get a cluster on my good conduct medal.
Pretty swell of the sergeant to tip us off about the secret mission.
We've got to remember not to talk to anyone about it.
It's a top secret.
That should be easy.
We don't know anything about it.
Here come the two volunteers they're going to shoot into space.
I wonder how they found two brave guys like that?
Simple.
They didn't tell them what they're volunteering for.
- Hiya, fellas.
- Hiya, soldiers!
- When do they blast off?
- I don't know.
I'll check with the waitress at the diner.
She gets all the scuttlebutt.
And now, gentlemen, we shall conduct a series of experiments to test your reactions under certain peculiar conditions.
- Please to follow me.
- Lead the way.
In this first experiment, we will test your reaction to gravity.
How are we doing?
I will tell you in just a moment.
Reaction to gravity: Normal.
Whatever goes up high, comes down hard.
And now, gentlemen, we'll proceed with the centrovical The spinning experiment.
We will see how many rpm you could take.
Okay, boys, fire one.
Sergeant, make them stop.
I'm getting dizzy.
Okay, men.
Halt!
At ease.
Reaction: Normal.
They flopped right on their faces.
And now for the rapid acceleration tests.
When I cut this rope what velocity!
Watch it, Barney, that hollow log up ahead!
Boy, that was good driving, Barney-boy.
Nothing to it, Fred.
Look, no hands.
Congratulations, men, you've passed all the tests.
And now, the time has come to say farewell.
You mean we'll be out of the Army?
You'll not only be out of the Army, you'll be out of everything.
You name it, you're out of it.
How about that, Barney?
We're getting out.
Gee, what a nice general.
And as a tribute to your courage, the boys are giving you a musical sendoff.
All right, maestro, start playing.
Wonderful, General.
Attention, men.
And a-one, and a-two, and play!
- Gosh, Fred, isn't that nice?
- Yeah, and look at the soldiers.
They're all lined up in our honor.
Thanks, fellows.
Come on down to the canteen tonight.
The milkshakes are on me.
I'm all choked up.
I've never seen such an exhibition of raw courage.
There should be something we could do for them.
- We could blast them off now, sir.
- That's it.
Blast them off.
I can't stand watching this.
- What kind of contraption is this, Fred?
- Search me, Barney.
Sarge, are we going someplace?
Oh, boy.
Yes, isn't it exciting?
Don't forget to drop us a card when you get to the moon.
The moon?
Did you hear that, Barney?
Yeah.
What a sense of humor.
It's a fine machine, Professor.
Just one thing how are the men going to get fresh air?
Fresh air?
For goodness sake, I knew I forgot something.
Somebody knock a couple of holes in that thing.
Sheriff, come quick!
Sundown Cobblestone is in town.
Sundown Cobblestone?
When did he get out of the calaboose?
We interrupt this program for a special announcement.
Scientists at Camp Millstone are about to send two men into space.
The brave volunteer astronauts are Pvt.
Fred Flintstone and Pvt.
Barney Rubble.
Keep tuned to this station for further developments.
My gosh, we'd better get down there fast and stop them.
- Hold it!
- Wait for us!
We're all ready, General.
Start the countdown, and keep crossed fingers.
Right.
Commencing countdown.
Six, five, four three, two, one.
Fire!
What do you know?
It worked.
Hey, you, we want to speak to our husbands.
Barney Rubble and Fred Flintstone.
- Professor, have we got another rocket?
- No, I only built one.
I'm sorry, Madam, but that will be impossible.
Pvt.
Rubble and Pvt.
Flintstone are somewhere out there.
Let me out of here.
Somebody call the police.
Barney, look.
All I can see is clouds.
- We must be a million miles up.
- We're on our way to the moon, Fred.
Yeah, the sergeant wasn't kidding.
It's starting to land.
Duck!
Barney-boy, this is it.
I want you to know I'm sorry for all the mean things I've done to you.
Likewise, Fred, but we had a lot of laughs together.
- So long, pal.
- So long, Barney.
You're the best little friend I ever had.
- Barney?
- Yeah, Fred?
- You're okay?
- I think so.
Boy, that was a rough landing.
Look at all the craters.
It's just like the pictures of the moon I've seen.
Gives you a funny feeling, being the first man on the moon.
You know what this means, Barney?
We're famous.
We'll be on the front page of every newspaper.
Every school kid will read about us in their history books.
- What do you think of that, Barney?
- I think it's great, Fred.
- Only there's one thing that bothers me.
- What's that?
How are we going to get back to read about it?
There they are, ladies.
They're not even dented.
Yoo-hoo, Fred.
Are you all right?
What are they doing up here on the moon?
Fred Flintstone, you come out of that thing this instant!
You too, Barney Rubble!
Whatever made you think you could fly a thing like that?
It was Fred's idea.
He got tired of walking, so we volunteered.
And I'm unvolunteering right now.
Congratulations, men.
You're the first guys we ever got off the ground.
I'll get a medal for this and you two heroes can have anything you want.
Just name it.
- These two heroes want out of the Army.
- And that's final.
Okay, if that's what you want, you're both out.
- That's what we want, sir.
- Right, sir.
We both want O-U-T- Out!
Do you mind if we take over from here, General?
They're all yours, ladies.
All right, you guys.
Attention!
Mark time, march!
Forward march!
Hup, two, three, four.
How do you like that, Barney?
- Out of one man's army - Right into one woman's army.
But I like it.
You're not kidding, Barney.
Let's head for home and some home cooking.
On the double.
March!
Hup, two, three, four.
Come on, Wilma, open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
We're pretty far out, Fred, I hope we don't run into a sea serpent.
Sea serpent.
Don't tell me you believe there are sea serpents.
Why, that's just a silly old myth.
Well, it could be, Fred, but I heard stories.
- Fred, I got a bite.
- Pull it in.
Oh, boy, this is a whopper.
- What did you catch, Barney?
- I think I caught a silly old myth.
What will I do, Fred?
What will you do?
Throw him back, that's what.
No, Dino, you can't go out till your daddy gets here.
- Hi, Wilma.
- Hi, Betty.
Come on in.
I can't, thanks.
Barney is due home any second.
I just wanted to check with you.
Are we going shopping tomorrow?
Sure thing.
Let's get an early start.
- What's with Dino?
- Every night, the same thing.
Dino knows Fred gets home exactly at 5:00 and I let him out to greet Fred.
5:00 and here comes Fred.
Okay, Dino, he's home.
Go say hello.
No, Dino, hold it, boy.
Now stop it, Dino.
You hear that, Dino, stop it.
This is embarrassing.
All the neighbors are looking.
Now be a good boy, Dino, put him down easy in the easy chair.
Every day he misses that chair.
I think he does it on purpose.
Dino wouldn't do that.
Would you, Dino?
- Hi, Fred.
- Hi, Betty.
That Dino sure loves you.
When Dino loves you, you better belong to some good hospital plan.
Anytime you want to give him away, we'll take him.
Not a chance.
- Goodnight, Wilma.
- Goodnight, Betty.
- Any mail today, honey?
- The usual, Fred.
More bills and more ads.
Bills and ads, that's all we ever get.
I never get a letter from anyone.
A shipwrecked sailor on an island in the middle of the ocean gets more notes in bottles than I get.
You don't get letters unless you write.
When was the last time you wrote a letter, Fred?
I wrote a letter to my mother from Boy Scout camp.
That wasn't last summer, believe me.
I still can't figure it out.
All the guys I used to know.
Close buddies Out every night together.
And I told them: "Fellows, my getting married won't change a thing.
"We'll still chum around together.
We'll play cards at my house "my wife will make sandwiches for us.
She's a good old Joe.
"She'll be like one of the gang".
What happened?
I never hear a word from any of them.
You'd think one of them, just one of them, would write.
From what I saw of that old gang of yours, half of them never learned to write and the other half can't read, except the big sign over the pool hall.
Oh, yeah?
They all could read.
How else could they figure out their racing forms?
Hey, Wilma, this ad is from Gus Gravel.
Who is Gus Gravel?
He's one of the old gang I was just telling you about.
- He wants to make a touch?
- No, he doesn't.
He's sent a nice friendly form announcing that he's running a hotel at the seashore.
Seashore?
Well, since you never take me anyplace there's no chance of running into him, which is good.
Oh, yeah?
Hey, wait a minute, Wilma.
Tomorrow starts a three-day weekend.
We could get down to Gus's hotel.
He might give us a rate for old time's sake.
I've got no old times with Gus-what's-his-name.
I don't even know him.
And if he's one of the old gang - I'd just as soon keep it that way.
- There you go again judging people you don't even know.
That's your big trouble, Wilma.
No, it isn't.
My big trouble is you and the way you wolf food down.
It's getting bigger all the time.
"The way I wolf food down"!
When I come home after a hard day's work I need some nourishment.
She did it again.
What happened to what we were talking about?
Every time a guy calmly discusses something with his wife somehow he ends up defending himself from something else.
They throw you a long slow curve and then the fast break.
What were we talking about?
Yeah, Gus Gravel and his hotel.
After I wolf down my dinner, I'll give him a ring.
That's the way it is, Mr. Gravel, I speak for the entire staff.
Now either you pay us or we all quit.
Be reasonable, Harvey.
I'm holding your money for you until the end of the season so you won't fritter it away.
Fritter, shmitter, we're walking out right now.
Go find yourself some other pigeons.
Oh, boy.
If only I hadn't bet the payroll on that fifth race.
Without them I won't be able to handle the convention crowd that's coming this weekend.
There's always a way out.
I'll think positively.
That's it, positive thinking.
That did it, I'm positively ruined.
Gravel Hotel, where the surf meets the rocks.
- Gus Gravel speaking.
- Hiya, Smoothy!
- We used to call Gus "Smoothy," Wilma.
- It figures.
- This is your old pal Fred.
- Fred?
Fred who?
Flintstone.
Hiya, Lard.
- They used to call me "Lard".
- Why not?
How's the old married man?
Great, just great.
Smoo, I was thinking of running down to your place for the big weekend.
Do you think you could give the wife and I a special rate?
Here's the end of a beautiful friendship.
You can!
Gee, that's swell.
You're a real friend.
By the way my next-door neighbor and his wife ain't got no plans if I bring them along, can they get a rate, too?
Tell you what, Fred.
You bring them along and it won't cost a cent.
You'll all be my guests.
Gosh, we couldn't do that.
We'd want to pay for something.
For our soap and towels, at least.
Okay, Smoothy, the soap and towels are free, too.
Goodbye, Fred.
See you all this weekend.
Boy, what a break.
Yeah, I always could talk old fatso Freddie into being my pigeon.
If his friends are as gullible as he is, I'll con them into working for me.
And I'll be able to handle the convention after all.
Old Smoothy.
I'd forgotten that name, but it fits.
I'm still the old Smoothy.
I don't get it, Fred.
Why would he give Betty and me a free vacation?
I told you, because he's a sweet, generous, lovable guy.
There are a few of us left, you know.
It doesn't sound right to me, but count me in.
I'd love to go.
Sure, I'd love to go.
But Barney and I'd rather pay our own way.
This Gus person won't accept any money.
He insists it's all on the house for old time's sake.
There's something screwy about a hotel owner who won't take money but I guess we have nothing to lose.
Nothing, except three days away from housework.
No ironing, no cooking, no dishes, no cleaning.
- Say no more, let's start packing.
- Right.
- Come on, Fred, let's get going.
- We've got to check our list first.
Go ahead, Barney.
- Dino?
- At the vet's.
- Fishing gear?
- Check.
- Bowling balls?
- Check.
- Ping-pong set?
- Check-a-roony.
- Swimsuits?
- Check-a-doodle.
- Catcher's mitt?
- Check.
- Skin-diving gear?
- Check-a-red-check.
We're only going for three days.
We're not going to compete in the Olympics.
And I don't want to spend the three days sitting here listening to an inventory.
Okay, we had to do this so we wouldn't forget anything.
Now we're all set.
See?
- What's the matter, Fred?
- I forgot the car keys.
Women have no sense of humor.
Fred Flintstone!
Gus Gravel!
Boy, am I glad to see you.
How are you, fatso?
You haven't changed a bit.
How do you do it, Fred?
How do you stay so young?
Why, I exercise a lot, Gus.
I lift weights.
Oh, brother, the only exercise he gets is lifting food to his mouth.
Who are those two gorgeous dolls?
Where?
That's my wife, Wilma.
Hello, Mr. Gravel.
And Mr. And Mrs. Barney Rubble, our neighbors.
- How do you do?
- Hiya, Gus.
How do you two guys rate such beautiful girls?
No wonder I never found the right girl to marry.
All the best ones are gone.
Now, I'll take your stuff up to your rooms.
You change into something more comfortable and run down to the beach while I order up a little lunch for you.
How about that guy Gus?
What a sweet guy.
It's working out great.
Smoothy strikes again.
- This is the life, Betty.
- It sure is.
Nothing to do but lie on the beach for three days.
I wonder what the poor people are doing.
Hey, you guys, last one in is a rotten dodo egg.
- Fred, you'll hurt yourself.
- Careful, Fred.
That's okay, he belongs to a hospital plan.
I knew it.
Hold on, Fred, I'm coming.
- Is he all right, Barney?
- Yeah, he's coming out of it now.
What are you all standing around for?
Let's have some fun!
Fred, can't you stay put for five minutes?
Five minutes!
What for?
We're only going to be here for three days.
- Barney, how about going fishing?
- Okay, good idea, Fred maybe we'll catch a mermaid.
Come on, skipper, let's get going.
Boy, this outboard motor is heavy.
We're pretty far out, Fred, I hope we don't run into a sea serpent.
Sea serpent.
Don't tell me you believe there are sea serpents.
Why, that's just a silly old myth.
Well, it could be, Fred, but I heard stories.
- Fred, I got a bite.
- Pull it in.
- Oh, boy, this is a whopper.
- What did you catch, Barney?
I think I caught a silly old myth.
What will I do, Fred?
What will you do?
Throw him back, that's what.
- Look out, Fred, you're rocking the boat.
- It's you, you knucklehead.
Help!
- Look, Betty, isn't that Fred and Barney?
- How could it be, they're fishing.
Front desk.
Would you repeat that, madam?
No, not that part.
You say there's two men in your room in a rowboat?
Very well, we'll send the house detective up to take care of the two men.
You'll have to take care of the rowboat yourself.
Really.
I was never so humiliated in my life.
You're just lucky we were able to calm that woman down.
Now, either you stay out of trouble, or you sit quietly on the beach.
Wilma is right, Fred, let's just relax for a while.
Relax!
Are you kidding?
We're on a vacation.
You and I are going skin diving, Barney.
These vacation athletes get me down.
Where are they now?
Here comes Fred, but where's Barney?
There's Barney.
They're just like a couple of kids, always playing games.
That's the last time I go skin diving with this guy.
Here comes Fred and his gang.
Time for me to go into my act.
Yeah, we're all tired, but a nice dinner will snap us out of it.
I'll see what old Smoothy has on the menu.
Hi, Smoo, how about a little lunch?
Hey, pal, you all right?
Hello, Fred.
What happened?
You look terrible.
Fred, I don't know how to tell you.
I feel like a heel.
Tell me what, pal?
I invite you people here for a good time and what happens?
My whole staff walks out on me.
- That's too bad, Smoothy.
- Thanks, Fred, thanks but it's my trouble, not yours.
I couldn't possibly ask you to help out.
- Help out?
- Yeah.
Remember how the old gang used to help each other out in the old days?
Yeah.
None of us have the old help-out spirit anymore, have we, Fred?
I got the old help-out spirit, Smoothy and your troubles are my troubles.
- Gee, Fred, do you mean it?
- You bet I do.
And here's the old gang's friendship handshake to prove it.
Old Smoothy has had a tough break.
His whole staff walked out on him.
- That does it.
- Yeah, let's get packed and leave.
Leave?
Do you mean to tell me you would leave this sweet, generous guy in his hour of need?
How selfish can you get?
He invited us here for a free vacation, he rolled out the welcome mat and then the minute he's in trouble, you want to desert him.
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
- I feel like a heel.
- Me, too.
Yeah, ditto.
Me, too.
You're right, Fred.
We should help him.
- Yeah, Fred.
What can we do?
- We can offer to help, that's what.
Of course, Smoo won't accept, being the kind of guy he is but my conscience won't bother me while we're packing.
- Okay, talk to him.
Then we'll leave.
- That's the spirit.
Smoothy, we've been talking it over and if there's anything we can do to help out you just name it.
Gee, Fred, that's great.
You be the chef Barney can be the bellboy and Wilma and Betty can be the maids.
Bless your little hearts.
You're true blue, through and through.
Now, if you'll excuse me I know you all have a lot of work to do.
So, Smoothy won't accept our help?
I guess he doesn't want to hurt our feelings by refusing.
Some vacation.
This is what I wanted to get away from: Housework.
At least we don't have to do the cooking, Fred's got that department.
Speaking of Fred.
I've got an idea that Smoothy character planned this whole thing.
Fred is so gullible.
We said we'd help.
Now we're stuck for three days.
Thank goodness there are only four of us.
- What is it, Wilma?
A riot?
- No, worse.
A convention.
There must be 200 people pouring into the hotel.
Go get Barney, I'll get Fred, we're getting out of here.
Roger.
- What a mob.
- Barney!
- Betty, what's the idea?
- The idea is we're getting out of here.
Now let's see, the cookbook says to fold in one dodo egg.
Okay, here it goes.
And I say it can't be done.
Fred, get that goop off your face, we're leaving.
What do you mean, leaving?
We can't let old Smoo down.
Well, old Smoo let us down.
He booked in a convention and the hotel is full of Loyal Water Buffaloes.
Smoothy wouldn't do a thing like that.
I've got to have proof.
Hey, Fred, make 350 dino burgers, 200 with onions 150 dodo-egg sandwiches, 26 cheese omelets 78 fried chicken livers, 82 tunas on rye and hurry it up.
That's proof enough.
I quit.
But, Fred, how can you do this to me after all I have done for you?
Hey, Smoothy.
- Hello, Your lmperial Grand Pooh-bah.
- What's the delay, pal?
We've got a lot of hungry Water Buffaloes waiting for grub.
There's going to be a long wait, the cook just quit.
- And so did the maids.
- And the bellboy.
What will we do, Grand Pooh-bah?
- The convention will be ruined.
- Ruined nothing.
We've got our wives the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes Women's Auxiliary.
I'll just declare an emergency and make them do all the work.
- You're kidding.
- Look, boy, back home I'm nothing but at the convention, I'm the Grand Exalted lmperial Pooh-Bah.
What I say goes.
Boy, what power for one man to have.
Yeah, stick around, friend, I might let you join the club.
Gee, thanks.
This meeting will now come to order.
His lmperial Exalted Grand Pooh-Bah ruler of the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes will now speak.
Speak, Exalted Grand Pooh-Bah.
It's amazing, Barney.
It must be that kooky hat he's wearing.
Members of the Women's Auxiliary we are faced with an emergency.
The hotel staff has quit, and I hereby order the Women's Auxiliary to save the convention by pitching in and helping out.
Group A will do the cooking.
Group B will do the washing and ironing.
Group C will do the cleaning and dusting.
I have spoken.
Has anyone anything to say?
You're out of your cotton-picking mind.
What do they think we are, slaves?
We came here for a vacation.
Caucus, smarcus.
Who do you think you are?
- Look, they're breaking up the chairs.
- Gee, I never saw women get so mad.
Make way!
Here, friend, consider yourself the new Exalted Ruler.
- After him, girls, he's out in the lobby.
- Let's lynch him.
Good idea.
Come on, Barney, let's get out of here.
If they see you with that hat on, you're dead.
Boy, what a close call.
We were lucky to get out of there alive.
What do we do now, Fred?
Go home?
What else?
Now hear this, you two Water Buffaloes.
Her Highness, your great leader, is going to speak.
You two sports are going to take us to a nice hotel where we can enjoy ourselves.
Yeah.
And we don't want to cook, wash, or do any dishes.
Capice?
We hear you, Great Exalted Grand Pooh-bah.
And we obey, Your Highness.
Yeah, if we know what's good for us.
Come on, Wilma, open the door!
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Watch it, will you, Barney?
Remember you're supposed to be Mrs. Betty Rubble.
Okay, Fred, I'll remember.
But I still don't think we'll get away with impersonating our wives.
Stop worrying, Barney.
We fooled the sponsor, didn't we?
Now go thin your eyebrows out.
They look like a couple of birds' nests.
And before Mrs. Flintstone wins $10,000, she'd better shave.
Watch it, you've got cold hands.
Oh, dear, it's Barney picking Fred up for work.
He'll be right out.
- Fred!
- Yeah, Wilma?
- You better hurry.
Barney's here already.
- I'll be right there.
What's the matter with him?
Didn't he sleep last night?
You'd better put a little something extra in my lunch box, Wilma.
- I'm gonna have to skip breakfast.
- I already did.
- Shall we take it from the top?
- Okay, shoot.
Okay.
One peanut butter and stegosaurus sandwich.
Peanut butter and stegosaurus.
Check.
- One hard-boiled dodo egg.
- Check the dodo egg.
One pterodactyl chopped liver sandwich and two frozen dino pizzas.
Check.
What's to drink?
- A tomato malt.
- Check.
- One quart of brontosaurus gumbo.
- Check the gumbo.
- There's celery, olives.
- Check.
- Four apples.
- Checkeroni.
- A peach, two pears - Check.
three bananas, five plums, a pineapple, and that wraps it up.
Hold it, hold it.
- Hold what?
- You forgot to put something in.
Like what?
The living room sofa?
No, my dessert, that's like what.
Oh, I forgot.
I already cut a piece of this marble cake I baked this morning.
You got a piece for the other cavity?
That's enough for you.
The rest is for Mrs. Pebble.
Her little boy Alonzo is sick.
That Alonzo.
Probably an upset stomach from all the junk he eats.
Boy, look who's talking.
Come on, Fred, let's go.
Okay, Barney, I am coming.
Keep your shirt on.
- All set, Wilma?
- All set.
Five, four, three, two, close it!
Fred, what's the matter?
My fingers were still in that box.
Impossible.
You couldn't get anything else in there.
You're a droll one.
Very droll.
- Morning, Wilma.
- Hi, Betty.
Come in.
Better hurry, Fred.
Barney's tooting his brains out.
What brains?
Anyway, Wilma had to fix me a little snack for lunch.
That's a little snack?
It so happens I have a physical type job which calls for a man-sized lunch.
And you've got lots of room to pack it away in.
That happens to be solid muscle.
Go ahead, punch, as hard as you can.
- Fred, please.
- Go on, Betty.
- No, Fred.
- Go on, let it fly with all you got.
Okay with you, Wilma?
- He asked for it.
- Come on, Betty, all you got!
Hurry up, will you, Fred?
You want me to be late for work again?
This'll be twice this week.
Boy, the same thing every day.
You never say good morning.
You just sit.
Some morning I'd like to hear you say something, anything.
I don't know how you do it, Wilma.
Your cake is delicious.
I'm not taking all the credit.
It's your recipe.
Maybe so, but mine never comes out as tasty as yours.
You know how I bake.
By feel.
A pinch here, a dash there.
You should pinch and dash yourself into the Tasty Pastry Contest.
Tasty Pastry Contest?
You know, the one on TV.
You mean the one with the $10,000 prize for the best recipe?
The same.
You can't loose.
You mean we can't loose.
You and I are gonna enter this thing together.
- Really?
- Really.
It's your recipe.
And your pinch here and dash there.
It's a cinch.
We'll call it the Upside-down Flint-Rubble bubble cake.
- Partner.
- Partner.
It's almost noon.
Stay for lunch and we'll write out the recipe.
Anything for another piece of that cake.
The heck with it.
- Hiya, Charlie.
- Hiya, Fred.
Boy, it don't take long for you to hit the lunch box.
Speaking of lunch boxes, stand back while I open mine.
Boy, just enough to hold me till dinner.
You're kidding.
What do I see?
A hunk of my favorite cake.
Yeah, and I'm saving it for last, and none for you so stop begging.
Thanks, Fred.
Delicious.
What a job.
Do you realize we spent the whole afternoon just chipping out that recipe?
I know, but it'll be worth it if we win.
I can't wait to tell Barney.
I can wait to tell Fred.
I can just hear him when I tell him it's called the Upside-down Flint-Rubble bubble cake.
Yeah, I know.
"Upside-down Flint-Rubble bubble cake?
"Oh, boy"!
Here come the boys now.
Good, maybe I can get Fred to mail the recipe for us before dinner.
- Hi, Fred.
Hi, Barney.
- Hi, Wilma.
Hello, Wilma.
Hello, Betty.
- Can you do us a favor?
- Sure, Wilma, what is it?
Will you take Dino for a walk and drop this in the mailbox?
- It's important.
- Well, sure, Wilma.
Here, Dino, here, boy.
Come on now.
Down, boy, down.
That Dino, he sure loves Fred.
Down, Dino, down.
What is this anyway, Wilma?
Betty and I are entering the Tasty Pastry Contest.
Tasty Pastry Contest?
It's Betty's recipe for that marble cake.
And Wilma's pinch-of-this-and-dash-of-that system.
We wrote it all down and called it the Upside-down Flint-Rubble bubble cake.
Upside-down Flint-Rubble bubble cake?
Oh, boy!
How silly can you get?
You know these contests are all fixed.
The sponsor's sister-in-law always wins.
Give me one good reason why we should waste a stamp on this contest.
The first prize is $10,000.
That's one good reason.
Come on, Dino.
I'll go with you, Fred.
Flint-Rubble bubble cake.
Oh, boy.
Fred, do you think the girls stand a chance in the Tasty Pastry Contest?
Are you kidding?
Dino has a better chance of winning than they have.
Whoa, boy, hold it.
That's the boy.
I know it's a waste of time sending this, but here goes.
Air mail!
Okay!
Do you have to yell?
I'm so nervous.
What time does this Tasty Pastry Contest go on?
In just a few minutes.
Relax.
I can't relax when I think of all that prize money.
Remember, Betty, money isn't everything.
Yeah, it can't buy friends.
No, but it can get you some high-class enemies.
Did you know the food expert Gravel Gourmet is gonna be the judge?
Really?
His tongue was written up in Good Cavekeeping.
I know.
I read his book: Put Your Stomach in My Hands.
- Quiet, everybody.
- Here's the show.
Good evening.
Tonight's story of a husband who runs away after his twelfth child is born is called, "Have Enough, Will Travel".
It is brought to you by the Tasty Pastry Company makers of Gookie Cookies.
Gookie Cookies are the very lightest cookies you can buy.
Gookie Cookies are so light and crunchy because they are made with Tasty Pastry flour.
- Skip it and get to the winner.
- We can't stand the suspense.
Impatient, aren't we?
Now, here's a cookie made with this junk.
Watch.
Now, a cookie from Brand "B".
Get the message?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, as you know tonight we announce the winner of our $10,000 cake recipe contest.
- Hey, this is it, Fred!
- Get ready with the mop for the tears.
As you know, most programs wait till the end of the program to announce the winner just to keep you in suspense.
He ain't kidding.
So tonight, we are going to be just as sneaky.
And the winning recipe will be announced after the next commercial.
Oh, no.
I can't stand any more of this brainwashing.
And now, a message from our sponsor.
Good evening.
I have a little something to say.
This program is costing me a fortune, so give me a break.
Buy my product.
I've got a son going to college.
I'm taking a beating in the rock market.
So have a heart.
Buy!
And now for the winning recipe.
We'd like to congratulate Mrs. Wilma Flintstone and Mrs. Betty Rubble.
We won!
We also congratulate Mrs. Rocky Graniteziano Mrs. Coral Reef, Mrs. Sandstone, and the other lucky winners.
What's with all those winners?
Search me.
I thought only one recipe gets a prize.
All the ladies whose recipes have qualified them for the big bake-off will be flown to this city next week given luxurious accommodations at one of our finest hotels and two hours before we go on the air they will be led into individual kitchens being constructed backstage at this studio, to bake their cakes.
I get it.
And the best cake gets the $10,000.
We still can win.
That's right, honey.
You can do it, can't you?
I mean, pinch and dash a cake even in a strange kitchen.
Betty and I will sure give it a try.
Attagirl.
We can't loose.
Well, partner, how about a little party to celebrate in advance?
Right, partner.
I'll get the ice cream and the Gookie Cookies.
And I'll get the ketchup.
Ice cream and ketchup?
I hope the girls are all packed and ready when we get home.
Their plane leaves in less than an hour.
With $10,000 going for us they'll be ready.
By the way, Barney, when I give you half the prize money what's the first thing you're gonna do with it?
Count it.
What're you gonna do with your half, Fred?
Something I always wanted to do.
- Travel.
- Yeah?
Where to?
The bowling alley, every day.
Wilma, let's go, honey.
The plane leaves in an hour.
That's funny, it's locked.
Maybe they're over at my house.
- We're in here, Fred.
- Both of us.
It sounds like they're crying.
What's wrong, Wilma?
Open up.
We can't.
We've got the measles.
All right, stop playing games.
Your plane leaves in an hour and The measles?
It can't be.
You were both all right this morning.
It broke out after you left to pick up the plane tickets.
First Wilma, then me.
We caught it from little Alonzo next door.
Alonzo?
I'll sue him!
This could cost us $10,000!
That's right.
You can't bake with measles.
The cake may break out.
And another thing, Fred.
You'll have to stay with Barney at his house for a few days - till we get over this.
- Measles are very contagious.
This is awful!
Don't worry, Fred.
Measles don't hurt.
They sure do, the worst kind of pain.
In the pocketbook.
You might as well return the plane tickets, Fred.
Betty and I will never make that contest in time.
Come on, Fred, cheer up.
Look at the bright side.
We'll be batching it for a few days.
We can go bowling every night stay up and see all the late shows on TV.
We'll have a ball waiting for the girls to get over the measles.
- Barney.
- Yeah, Fred?
We ain't blowing the dough for a measly measle.
What do you mean, Fred?
You know the girls can't leave the house.
No, but we can.
- So?
- So, you and I are going to that bake-off contest.
Fred, you sick or something?
That contest is for ladies.
How dare you, sir?
Are you insinuating I ain't a lady?
No, Fred, but - Now, wait a minute, pal.
- You get it, Barn.
With a couple of wigs and some of Betty's clothes we'll take our wives' place at the bake-off.
Fred, not me, no, not me.
And why not?
It's for a good cause.
Namely $10,000.
- Where's your get up and go?
- It just got up and went.
Besides, what would we tell the girls?
We don't tell them nothing till we bring home the prize money.
They have to stay in the house for a week so they'll never even know we're gone.
It'll never work, Fred.
Count me out.
I can't.
Wish I could, but I can't.
It's got to be two of us.
And you're going, Mrs. Rubble!
And as the sponsor of the Tasty Pastry program I officially welcome you to the contest Mrs. Flintstone and Mrs. Rubble.
Thank you so much.
I hope you ladies find this room satisfactory.
Yes, it's charming.
Don't you think so, Betty?
Ain't it just ducky, Betty?
Ouch!
I mean, ouch!
My recipe partner's voice is a bit hoarse from the plane ride.
She does sound a bit peculiar, doesn't she?
Perhaps you ladies should freshen up a bit before we go to the TV studio.
That's a good idea, sir.
We are a bit of a mess after the plane ride.
Boy, you can say that again.
I mean, yes.
I will see you later.
- Ta-ta.
- Bye-bye.
Oh, boy!
That was close.
Watch it, will you, Barney.
Remember you're supposed to be Mrs. Betty Rubble.
Okay, Fred, I'll remember.
But I still don't think we'll get away with impersonating our wives.
Stop worrying, Barney.
We fooled the sponsor, didn't we?
But we ain't gonna fool anybody when we try to bake an Upside-down Flint-Rubble double bubble cake.
That's the easy part, Barney.
All we do is follow the recipe we sent in.
Now go thin your eyebrows out.
They look like a couple of birds' nests.
And before Mrs. Flintstone wins $10,000, she'd better shave.
How're you doing, Barney?
Brother!
I don't know if this torture is worth it.
Keep your mind on the $10,000.
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's me, Mrs. Flintstone.
May I come in?
Just a minute, please.
- Quick, Barney, the wigs.
- The wigs, where are they?
- Where'd you put them?
- How do I know?
- Over here.
Yeah, the chair.
- Over here?
Hurry!
You can come in now.
Thank you.
Oh, my gosh!
What happened?
Fred, the lather is still on your face.
You mean this.
It's a new kind of beauty cream.
We use it all the time.
Makes the skin as smooth as a peach.
See.
You must be using too much, dear.
You're starting to develop a fuzz.
Say, I could have sworn you were a blond, Mrs. Flintstone and Mrs. Rubble was a brunette.
We are I mean, were.
It's that bleach Wilma and me use.
Cheap stuff.
Keeps changing the color of our hair.
It's called Instant Anything.
Instant Anything?
And would you believe it?
Yesterday I was a plaid.
At this point, I'll believe anything.
Let's get down to the TV station, Mrs. Plaid.
I mean, Mrs. Peaches Mrs. Flintstone.
Oh, boy!
The people you meet in a baking contest.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
The Tasty Pastry bake-off contest is now under way.
The contestants are backstage in separate kitchens preparing their cakes.
And in a few moments the judges will announce the winner of the grand prize.
I wonder if Fred and Barney are watching the program at my house.
With us not in it, they have no interest.
My guess is that they're down at the bowling alley.
See how easy it is, Barney.
All we do is follow the instructions on Wilma's recipe.
I got to hand it to you, Fred.
The plan might work after all.
Let me see now.
Add flour while gently stirring.
Pass the flour, Barney.
Flour?
- We're all out of flour.
- Don't just stand there.
There are three boxes on that table over there.
Grab one.
Okay, Fred.
One box of flour coming up.
They've been baking for hours now.
Isn't this exciting?
Too bad our Upside-down Flint-Rubble double-bubble cake isn't entered.
We didn't stand a chance anyway.
Here comes the announcer.
Maybe they've got a winner.
And now the moment we've all been waiting for.
The judges have unanimously decided on the winning recipe.
And the grand prize of $10,000 goes to the team of Mrs. Wilma Flintstone and Mrs. Betty Rubble for their Upside-down Flint-Rubble double-bubble cake.
- That's us!
- We won!
What's the matter?
How come we won?
We didn't bake any cake.
And here they are, ladies and gentlemen.
The winners of the grand prize Mrs. Fred Flintstone and Mrs. Barney Rubble!
- Fred?
- Barney?
And now, ladies would you tell 6 million people who are watching this program what brand of flour you used to bake this award-wining cake?
Sure.
That's easy.
Show them, Mrs. Rubble.
Okay, Mrs. Flintstone.
It's right here.
This is the brand.
It's brand Ladies and gentlemen the judges have made a slight mistake.
The winner is a lady who always uses Tasty Pastry flour: Mrs. Rocky Graniteziano!
Try to understand, ladies.
We can't have rival flour be responsible for winning on the Tasty Pastry Show.
Think of my reputation.
Well, you won't get away with this.
We won fair and square.
We'll sue!
We'll take this to the highest court!
- Fred.
- It's a fraud, that's what it is.
- Lxnay, Fred.
- We know our rights!
- Fred.
- What do you want, Barney?
You just flipped your wig, Fred!
Did you say "fraud," gentlemen?
Now, wait, wait a minute!
Let go!
Hold it!
This is no way to treat a lady.
Are you all right, Barney?
I think so, Fred.
What'll we do now?
Let's go home.
We better hurry, Wilma.
I hate to come in in the middle of a movie.
We're leaving now, boys.
When you get through there are more dishes to wash in Betty's house.
Come on, Wilma, have a heart.
We've been washing dishes every night for a week now.
Give us a break.
You wanted to be us, and now you're getting your chance.
Would you rather we told your bowling pals about your little trip to the big city Mrs. Flintstone and Mrs. Rubble?
All right, you win.
The boys would never stop ribbing us.
That's right.
So goodbye now.
Wilma and I will have breakfast in bed again in the morning.
Bye, Barney dear.
Goodbye, boy Girls.
Goodbye.
How about letting me wash for a while and you wipe, Wilma?
Okay.
Will you stop that Wilma stuff?
You make me sick!
Hey, that's it!
If I was sick, I wouldn't have to do this stuff.
Fred, where are you going?
Over to Alonzo's house.
Maybe it ain't too late to catch the measles.
Wait for me, partner.
Measles, here we come!
Wilma!
Come on, Wilma, open the door!
