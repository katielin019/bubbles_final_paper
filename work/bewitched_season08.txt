{START OF EPISODE 01}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Come on, Sam, we'll be late.
Sweetheart, the Tower of London has been standing there since the year 1000.
I promise you it won't go away.
If that's Larry, tell him I was lost at sea.
You think it could be him?
He knows we're on vacation.
He knows, but he doesn't care.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mother.
I'll get on the extension.
Are the children behaving themselves?
Oh, they're perfect little darlings.
As a matter of fact, they're right here, and they want to say hello.
Say, "Hello, Mommy".
Come on.
Hello, Mommy.
Yes.
Say, "Hello, Daddy".
Hello, Dad.
Hello, Adam.
Hi, sweetheart, how are you?
Are you having a good time with Grandmama?
Oh, yeah.
This morning we all went swimming in the pool.
Pool?
What pool?
We don't have a pool.
Grandmama zapped it up.
What?
Put Grandmama back on the phone.
What is it, Durwood?
Endora, didn't you promise, on what you laughingly call your honor, not to pull any of that hocus-pocus in front of the kids?
Oh, don't get your giblets in an uproar.
I removed the pool when the children were through swimming.
Darrin, it is not necessary to thrash this out on a long-distance phone call.
Oh, don't worry, this call isn't costing you anything.
Why not?
Because I'm using Tabitha's phone.
Now, don't you realize what a poor example you're setting for the children?
Now, why couldn't you use the regular phone?
Because there's one thing it can't do.
What is that?
This.
Endora!
Did he get the idea, Samantha?
Yes, Mother.
He got it.
And now I think I'm gonna get it.
Bye.
Don't they look great in their uniforms?
Uh-huh.
And they make a marvelous gin too.
Now, centuries ago, people had the misleading impression that the Tower was erected by Julius Caesar, right after he conquered Gaul.
Now, this happened not to be the truth.
Caesar did not build the Tower of London, although he certainly had the gall to do it.
A bit of humor never hurts, I always say.
But now onto more serious matters.
Now, this here room is hung with portraits of previous royal subjects.
The true facts are, the Tower was begun by William the Conqueror in the year 1066, and has been added to by succeeding occupants of the British throne.
Pst, pst.
Pst.
Shh.
TOUR  so, in case of an attack, only the defenders could use their right hand.
If you follow me, we'll visit the crypt of St. John's Chapel, which was also used as a prison when the dungeons down below had standing room only.
Pst, pst.
Pst, pst.
You hissed?
You could have gotten me into a lot of trouble.
Oh, forgive me, madam, but I'd almost given up hope.
Would you believe you're the first witch in over 400 years to take this tour?
Well, if you're my prize, I'm not interested.
Let me explain.
A hateful witch placed me under a curse and doomed me to remain here for 1000 years.
A thou A thousand years?
That's a long time, even in the life of a warlock.
Now, come on, everybody, stick together and follow me right through here.
I don't want none of you getting lost as we go through these halls here.
Right behind me, that's the way.
Move along.
You must have committed a terrible crime to earn this kind of punishment.
On the contrary.
All I did was fall in love with a witch in the court of King Henry VIII and ask her to marry me.
Well, why would the hateful witch object to that?
Because I was already married to the hateful witch.
Oh.
No wonder she was so hateful.
I don't know if your powers are strong enough to release me, but I beg of you, please try.
Well, I don't believe in philandering, but it seems to me you've served your sentence.
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!
Now, what could I do to repay you?
Well, you can start by letting go of my hand, or I'll miss the rest of the tour.
Sam, what And where did he come from?
Out Out of that painting.
I'll explain later.
Sam, you've just defaced a national treasure.
Don't worry, I'll un-deface it in a minute.
Who is this varlet?
He's no varlet, he's my husband.
TOUR  We will ascend to the second floor to visit the royal apartments.
Uh-oh.
I'll try and head them off.
Do something with him.
My dear lady, I am forever in your gratitude.
I'm your slave.
Well, sorry, but we're fully staffed.
I see you're still at it, you wretched rogue!
You knave!
Malvina, oh, please.
I've suffered long enough.
I'll be the judge of that.
And as for you, you miserable little witch, who gave you the right to reverse my curse?
Nobody.
And I apologize.
Apology not accepted.
Now put him back where he belongs.
Okay, okay.
I don't know how this pebble got in my shoe.
I'll just be a second.
Very well, sir.
But it'd help a lot all around if you wouldn't go traipsing off by yourself.
Just be a banana and stick with the bunch.
I'll show you what we do with meddlers.
Oh, Malvina This trip through time will teach you a lesson in others' affairs, not to mess in.
Back to Henry VIII go you.
The moment you meet him is the moment you'll rue.
Could you tell me what place this is?
What place?
Marry, 'tis a place where the King changes wives as often as a woman changes her mind.
What's that?
The King's fifth wife just lost her head.
You mean they shoot off the cannon every time she gets angry?
Uh..
No, child, it's You mean: It seems to be less troublesome than divorce.
Bless you, my child.
Yes, I'll accept the call.
Hello, Durwood.
What do you mean Samantha's gone?
How can you lose a grown woman?
I didn't lose her.
She ran off with a nobleman?
Oh, how wonderful.
Didn't run off with a nobleman.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, in a painting?
A curse?
I see!
This could be serious, Durwood.
If it wasn't, would I be calling you?
I think I better get Esmeralda to mind the children.
I'll meet you in front of the painting right away.
Right away?
Yes.
If I get there first, I'll start without you.
The hunt is on The hunt is on And it is Well nigh day And Harry our King Is hunting To bring his gear to make The hunt is on The hunt is on And it is Well nigh day And Harry our King Greetings to you all.
My lord.
My lord.
Good morrow, my Lord Chamberlain.
You've come in good time.
The King sorely needs your cheer.
Aye, we heard the cannon proclaim the sad news.
Chop and change, chop and change.
Now we'll have none of that, if you please.
Come, masters, I'll show you to your quarters.
Come along.
Excuse me.
What manner of costume is that?
Is there anything wrong with it?
It is, to say the least, minimal covering.
When you appear before His Majesty, you'd better maxify it.
But Go along now.
This way.
This way.
Make yourselves ready, masters.
The King is even now in the dining hall.
Burying his sorrow in the roast beef?
Enough, or you will be made to leave.
As long as I do not leave here headfirst like the Queen.
Cease these jackanapes.
I will send word when you must appear.
And find this one some clothing more suitable to the occasion.
Well, now, mistress, can you do something to entertain?
I I don't know.
Then, why are you here?
Isn't it obvious?
She is a very special friend of the Chamberlain's.
Apparently I seem to have no trouble entertaining all of you.
TouchÃ©.
Just a little jest.
No offense.
A foolish jest at my expense!
A rhyme!
Art thou then a poet?
Be still.
Can you sing or dance a jig or play an instrument?
I seem to remember playing something like this when I was a child.
I-I-It's called a lute.
Then you shall sing and play for His Majesty, and I will teach you some of his favorites.
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.
Just follow me.
Up here, Durwood.
What are you doing there?
Horsing around.
Will you cut that out?
I'm just getting some information.
I don't know if they still imprison people here, and I'd rather not find out.
Now, will you get out of there?
I was getting the necessary information from Herbie.
Samantha has been zapped back to the court of Henry VIII in the year 1542.
Henry VIII, the eighth?
How terribly clever of you to figure that out.
Ahh.
Poor Catherine.
She had a lovely neck.
What a pity, huh?
A pity indeed, sire.
At least she got rid of those chronic headaches of hers.
They say that a man cannot live with a wife nor without one.
But after five failures, I'm determined never again to so much as look at another.
Early one morning Just as the sun was rising I heard a maiden singing In the vale below Look at another what, sire?
Sh, sh.
Oh, never leave me How could you use A poor maiden so?
Remember the vows That you made to your Mary Remember the bower Where you vowed to be true Oh, don't deceive me Oh, never leave me How could you use A poor maiden so?
Oh, gay is the garland And fresh are the roses I've culled a garden To bind on my brow Oh, don't deceive me Oh, never leave me How could you use A poor maiden so?
Rise and be seated.
What is your name, dear child?
I know not.
I know not?
What a strange name.
You must be Irish.
But, uh, you have a lovely voice.
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.
My late wife, Catherine, used to sing to me.
But now  Would you like to stay in the palace and take Catherine's place?
As a singer, I mean.
Well, if it please, Your Majesty.
I can only hope, that like your late wife, I do not lose my voice.
Because of Malvina's curse, Samantha has no powers and can't return to the present unless someone in this century woos and wins her with a kiss.
Guess who's elected?
You You're joking.
There's more.
Not only does Samantha not have her witchcraft, but she doesn't even know who she is, nor who you are.
Beautiful.
Now I'm supposed to kiss a perfect stranger.
What's to stop her from slapping me in the face?
Fortunately, nothing.
One thing about your mean streak, Endora, it's consistent.
Now, let's get going.
But first First you need an appropriate costume.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
Thanks a lot!
Why couldn't I have the nobleman's clothes?
Because you'll be a lot more believable as a peasant.
But I Quiet!
But what about the painting Quiet!
Backward, turn backward.
Oh, time, in thy flight, take this peasant away from my sight, back to the time of Henry VIII, who was long on wives but short on faith.
No!
Excuse me, could you tell me how far it is to the court of King Henry VIII?
Oh, you have a long, long way to go.
Are you sure?
Oh, positive.
You see, this is the court of Henry I. Terrific.
That was beautiful, Endora.
You only missed the target by 500 years.
But I guess at your age, your powers are bound to slip a little.
Would you care to repeat that?
No.
But I knew it would get to you.
You sent me back to the time of Henry I. Well, so what?
I was only seven Henrys off.
Seven Henrys and 500 years.
A mere tick of the universal tock.
Okay, let's try again.
First, I think we'd better take a little precaution.
In case you get into trouble again, which you undoubtedly will.
Place this talisman around your neck.
When you need me, put it between your teeth, and flap your arms like this.
And do this.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
Quack, quack.
You're kidding.
Well, if you'd rather go it alone No, no, I'll keep it.
Are you ready?
Just watch your aim.
Silence!
Backward, turn backward.
Oh, time, in thy flight, back to the past with the speed of light.
To Henry's time, let's check the date, and do not pass Henry number eight.
What did the King say?
Did our poor efforts please him?
He was very complimentary.
You were a smash.
What does that mean?
I, uh I-I think it means you were superb.
As were you.
We would be most honored if you would wish to join our company.
Are you mad?
Do you imagine for a moment that the Lion of England would let this cub go?
Nay, she is for his den.
Mind him not.
He has a bell clapper for a tongue.
His Majesty, the King.
Arise, rise, rise.
We could not let you depart without paying our respects to each of you.
You are truly masters of your profession.
Thank you, my gracious liege.
You are very much to be congratulated.
You, sir, you, sir, you, sir you, sir, and you, sir.
Out!
Come, come.
I'm sure you must all be anxious to be on your way.
No, no, no, wait!
I'm going with you.
But we desire you to stay.
Is that a command?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
We would not dream of forcing you to stay against your will.
You may do as you wish.
We only suggest that you will find the palace more comfortable than the dungeon.
Good luck and goodbye.
Are you afraid of us?
No, Your Majesty.
Good.
Will you stop retreating?
I will, if you stop advancing.
Very well.
No use to struggle, my dear.
We are the champion wrestler of the British Isles.
Then shouldn't we pick on someone our own size?
Do you realize how many women would be delighted to change places with you?
Good.
Why don't we call one of them?
Delightful sense of humor!
Perhaps Perhaps we should make you our wife.
What do you say to that?
Well, Your Majesty, I may not know much, but I do know that you are a no-no.
Are you saying that you would not care to be the wife of Henry VIII?
With all due respect, Your Majesty, no.
Why not?
Well, frankly, your wife expectancy isn't too great.
I know.
We'll make you a lady-in-waiting.
And just between you and me you won't have to do much waiting.
Ugh!
How does a nice little witch like Samantha get out of the clutches of a big, bad wolf like Henry VIII?
Next week on Bewitched.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
How did a nice little witch like Samantha get mixed up with a big bad wolf like Henry VIII?
It all started in the Tower of London when Samantha got carried away by the plight of a warlock named Herbie.
I don't know if your powers are strong enough to To release me but I beg of you, please try.
Well, it seems to me you've served your sentence.
And that is where Samantha made her big mistake.
Sam, what?
Where did he come from?
Darrin blew his top.
But that wasn't the topper.
This was the topper.
Who gave you the right to reverse my curse?
Nobody.
And I apologize.
Apology not accepted.
Now put him back where he belongs.
Okay, okay.
Now, I'll show you what we do with meddlers.
Oh, Malvina This trip through time Will teach you a lesson.
In others' affairs Not to mess in.
Back to Henry VIII go you.
The moment you meet him Is the moment you'll rue   And that's how Samantha got carried away to the court of Henry VIII.
Early one morning Just as the sun was rising I heard a maiden Singing in the field below Oh, don't deceive me Oh, never leave me How could you use A poor maiden so?
Ahhh.
Endora explained that in order to get Samantha back from the 16th century, Darrin would have to go back to that time, find Samantha and win her with a kiss.
Place this talisman around your neck.
When you need me, put it between your teeth and flap your arms like this: And do this:  You're kidding.
No!
As Darrin started in pursuit of Samantha, His Majesty, Henry VIII was engaged in exactly the same activity.
We are the champion wrestler of the British Isles.
Well, this-then shouldn't we pick on someone our own size?
We shall make you a lady-in-waiting.
And just between you and me, you won't have to do much waiting.
Of all the birds That ever I see The owl is the fairest In her degree For all the day long She sits in a tree And when the night comes Away flies she Te-whit, te-whoo To whom drinks thou Sir, knave, to you?
This song is well-sung I make you a vow And he's a knave That drinketh now Nose, nose Jolly red nose And who gave thee That jolly red nose?
Cinnamon, ginger Nutmeg and cloves And that gave me My jolly red nose That was lovely.
Thank you, sire.
Come and sit here beside us, my sweet.
Do you like us?
Yes, Your Majesty.
Well, then why don't you show us some affection?
Well, uh, how can I?
Neither of you ever stops eating.
You there!
Take these mounts.
You give them a good cooling.
We've ridden posthaste from the Tower.
Excuse me.
Uh, who is that singing?
She sits in a tree That is the king's new favorite.
Already?
You may well say that.
If I do not mistake the signs, she is fated to take the place of poor Catherine.
Eh, Catherine?
What happened to her?
Are you deaf, man?
Did you not hear the cannons proclaim the sad news early this morning?
Sad news?
When the queen lost her head.
Cinnamon, ginger Y-you mean: Precisely.
H-how can you be so sure that the king is serious about this lady?
These are the late queen's jewels.
We were sent to the Tower to fetch them so His Majesty could present them to his lady love.
What do you think, boy?
Is that serious?
Oh, boy, is that serious.
Nose, nose Jolly red nose And who gave thee That jolly red nose?
Cinnamon, ginger Nutmeg and cloves That gave me My jolly red nose  Yes?
We've come with the jewels, sire.
Enter, enter!
Stop.
What do you want?
You're needed right away downstairs.
The jewels are all here and accounted for?
With the exception of a pearl necklace that That needs restringing.
Uh, open this, my sweet.
Yes?
The pastry tray, Your Majesty.
Enter, enter!
Your Majesty.
That will be yours, my lovely.
Oh.
But I've done nothing to deserve this.
You will.
May we speak with Your Majesty privately a moment?
It concerns the reaction of the crowd at this morning's event.
Pastry, eh, milady?
No, thank you.
You really don't recognize me, do you?
Should I?
I-I know you don't remember anything, but W-well, look into my eyes.
Look deep.
Don't you see anything?
Yes.
Why are your eyes so bloodshot?
Probably because I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Just give me a little kiss, and it'll all come back to you.
What?
Shh.
Think, think.
I'm Darrin, your husband.
You're Samantha.
I'm a mortal.
You're a witch.
Now, please, try to remember.
Why?
Sounds like a good thing to forget.
You've gotta get out of here while they're talking.
Unhand me, you peasant.
Unhand me.
Zounds!
What knavery is this?
Eh, pastry, me Majesty?
For this you shall die!
Your Majesty, I beg of you, restrain yourself.
Another killing now will only inflame the people further.
Yes, let's not inflame the people.
Sam, please, one little kiss a-and all this will make sense to you.
Take him away.
Your Majesty, spare him.
Why?
Why not?
What?
Well, it's obvious the poor man has lost his senses.
Oh, well.
Summon the guards and have him thrown into the dungeon.
Take him from my sight.
Wait a minute.
You can't do this to me.
I'm not even a British citizen.
Why did he call me Sam?
We don't know.
But for that alone, we shall have him beheaded.
Hey, what are you doing there?
Hey, there.
You, there.
Hey, what are you doing?
Hey, there, what are you doing?
What is it?
I-I was just wondering, uh, what you were doing.
It don't take much brains to figure out this ain't for butchering chickens, do it?
No, it don't.
Don't.
Lucky for you, His Majesty is busy having a masked ball.
Because I haven't got the orders yet.
Endora, I never dreamed I'd welcome your interference, but here goes.
In trouble again?
Again?
I've never been out of it.
We've got to get to Samantha right away.
The King executed his fifth wife this morning, and he's planning to make Sam number six in the big parade.
That is grim.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Open the door.
And how would you suggest I do that?
Give it a zap.
For your information, Darwin, since this is the 16th century, I do not have my powers.
W-why not?
Because it's the 16th century, and I wasn't even born yet.
Could have fooled me.
Look here, Durweed, I only have the power to get here and to leave here.
Okay, okay.
I'm only staying because Samantha needs her mama.
But if you don't have your powers, how are you gonna get me out of here?
Well, I'll just have to use my native ingenuity.
I'm dead.
You, there!
Come here at once.
What are you doing here?
There are no visitors allowed.
For your information, my good man, I am not a visitor.
I am here by the order of His Majesty Henry VIII, King of England, France and King of Ireland.
You are?
He has asked me to check on the conditions of the prisoners.
I am appalled.
You are?
This prisoner has a gold coin in his possession.
Give me the coin.
There.
You see?
You know that prisoners are not to have gold.
Your eyes are getting very heavy.
Gold is the root of all evil.
You are getting so tired.
And this chain is definitely a dangerous weapon.
You want to sleep.
Sleep.
Sleep.
He's out.
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
Oh, Durwood.
Durwood, wake up!
Wake up!
Oh, Endora, am I glad to see you.
I was having this ridiculous nightmare that I was back in the 16th It's a real nightmare.
Here, take the coins.
Now, tell me this, did you try?
Did you try to approach Samantha?
Oh, yes.
And she wouldn't have a thing to do with me.
Oh, if that had only happened when you first met.
Now, come on.
Let's find Samantha.
No, wait.
What?
What about him?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
I'll give him a post-hypnotic suggestion.
When you wake, you'll feel rotten.
Come on.
Where is she?
There.
Do I look okay?
Splendid.
The court tailor was a very easy subject, wasn't he?
That was lovely, my dear.
We are very pleased.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
Endora, quick.
And before the music starts again, you've got to get to Samantha.
Getting to Samantha is no problem.
But trying to convince her that you'd make a better husband than Henry VIII doesn't make too much sense.
Hope I can do it without choking on the words.
Just convince her, and you can choke afterwards.
Your Majesty.
Milady, I'm very happy for you.
I know you don't remember me, but your mother and I were very close.
You knew my mother?
Oh, yes.
Then you know who I am?
Definitely.
Who am I?
You really want to know?
Oh, yes, yes, desperately.
You see that young man over there?
Give him a kiss, just one little kiss, and it will all come back to you.
Who are you?
A very close friend of your mother's, who, incidentally, was a very lovely woman.
I don't think she would approve of your involvement with the king.
No?
Why not?
Well, for one thing, he's too fat.
He's not fat.
He's just a little short for his weight.
You mean he'd be thin if he were 10 or 11 feet tall?
Shh.
Do you want to be accused of treason?
Be smart.
Give him a little kiss, just one little kiss.
You!
Please don't yell.
I told you not to show your face.
Now, look, my dear.
Is he not more of a match for you?
He's young  And handsome  And charming.
What's the matter?
It's difficult to talk when one is choking.
Endora, will you knock it off?
Sam, please, for the sake of the children.
Children?
Well, they're not born yet.
But they will be if you'll just cooperate a little.
Oh!
I beg your pardon.
Oh, Sam  Your Majesty.
One little kiss.
Sam, just one little kiss.
Guards!
Seize this wretch!
How did he escape from the dungeon?
I know not, sire, unless it be by the use of magic.
You must be out of your senses to show your face here.
I didn't mean to show my face.
My mask slipped.
We were undecided about your fate, but now, by heaven, you shall be beheaded.
Away!
Wait!
I-if it please Your Majesty, this lady was very close to my mother.
Oh.
Now what is it?
Why not have some fun with him first?
Hm.
What did you have in mind?
Well, your prowess in wrestling is known throughout the kingdom, Your Majesty.
How about a match with this, eh, poltroon?
Oh-ho-ho, madam.
Between this spindly figure of a man and ourselves there can be no match.
We would crush him like a dried leaf.
Well, so what?
He's going to be executed, anyway.
Thanks, Endora.
I hope your broom goes bald.
I just think he wants to be coaxed.
Oh, please.
Please, Your Majesty.
It would be so much fun.
Well, if the sight of blood and the sound of bones snapping will not offend the ladies, very well.
Release him!
Endora, are you crazy?
It's the only way to reach Samantha, to strike a responsive chord in her.
What's going to be struck is my head against this marble floor.
Would you rather have it fall into a basket?
You have to trust me.
Trust you?
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.
At least I'll die laughing.
Stand back, stand back.
Not you.
Ready?
Why, he's nothing but a coward.
Zounds, man!
This is a wrestling match, not a footrace.
You pick your sport, I'll pick mine.
The king is cracking him like a walnut.
What fun.
Fun?
I think it's cruel.
What did you say?
Uncle.
I wouldn't want his death on my conscience.
You've killed him.
Well, wasn't that the idea?
You simply have no feelings, you big klutz.
Klutz?
What is "klutz"?
Ungh!
Thank heaven he's alive.
But he may not be for long.
Just one kiss before I go.
Darrin.
Sam.
Zounds!
Come on.
Come on.
Get up, get up.
Hang on, kids.
Here we go.
Where?
Where did they go?
Where did who go, sire?
Oh, my lady and that poor foolish knave and And that woman.
I think, Your Majesty, I'm not sure, but I think we are having a royal dream.
Oh.
Well, in that case, shouldn't we be asleep?
Sire, your wisdom knows no bounds.
Sleep.
Ah!
There.
The way they have distorted a famous portrait, it's downright desecration, is what it is.
And as you well know, when Scotland Yard takes up a case, they always gets their man.
You'll have to excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.
This has been a most unusual day for me.
Most unusual day.
Sweetheart, are you all right?
Well, considering I just lost a wrestling match to Henry VIII, no.
Psst.
Psst.
Ahem.
My dear lady, I would like a word with you.
Oh.
Now, look, I've gotten into enough trouble because of you.
I was not addressing you.
I was addressing that lovely and gracious lady at your side.
Who?
Me.
You know, I think he's kind of cute.
My gracious lady.
Mother, why did you do that?
I'm taking him with me.
What?
Babysitters are allowed to have friends in, aren't they?
Pay no attention to them, Herbie.
Sam, you shouldn't have let her do that.
Now, look at it this way.
Maybe she was tired of just watching television in the evening.
I was talking about the painting.
It's supposed to be a portrait of Sir Herbert Wellingford.
Oh.
Well, I can fix that.
"The Missing Horseman"?
Sam, that's ridiculous.
Well?
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Esmeralda, postcards from Mommy.
Dear Tabitha and Adam, this is a view of Loch Ness.
It's a large lake, fed by the river Ness.
"Loch" is the Scottish word for lake.
I knew that.
You did not.
This is the home of the famous.
Loch Ness monster, but more about him later.
The lake is near a town called Inverness, which is in Scotland.
We're here visiting a cousin of your daddy's.
His name is Robbie and he owns a small hotel.
That's where we're staying.
Oh, oh.
That's all for now.
Love from us both.
Ah.
Some have meat That cannot eat.
And some would eat That want it.
But we have meat And we can eat.
And say "The Lord be thankit".
Time to feed the inner man, eh?
The inner woman is starving too.
You've got a bonnie wee witch there, Cousin Darrin, have you not?
Close enough, Cousin Robbie.
The salmon looks delicious.
Very expensive too, I might add.
If I was charging you for that, you'd be paying a pretty penny for it, you can be sure.
Business has been very, very bad.
Why is that?
Well, you've no doubt heard of the Loch Ness monster.
He's the only tourist attraction we have around here and he's been a wee bit shy these past few years.
With no monster, Loch Ness is just another loch.
Robbie, has it ever occurred to you that the reason he's been shy is that there is no Loch Ness monster?
Nay monster?
It's that kind of propaganda that keeps the tourists away, laddie.
Fact is I've seen the beastie with my very own eyes and fearfully too.
Robbie.
Robbie.
Darrin, get Get some water.
Darrin?
Oh, my stars.
Bruce.
Get back in the water.
You're making a spectacle of yourself.
I don't know where Serena is.
Now, get lost.
Darrin.
Darrin.
Robbie?
Robbie.
What?
Happened?
You both fainted.
Are you sure of that, now?
Sometimes I doze off very, very quickly and it looks like I fainted.
No.
You saw Okay.
I saw the monster and I fainted.
Did you see him?
Did you see him?
Yes.
Cute, isn't he?
I gotta spread the news.
The monster's back!
The monster's back!
I don't know which was more shocking: Seeing that monster yesterday, or having Robbie treat us to a champagne dinner last night.
Which, if you'd have had to pay,  Would have cost you a pretty penny.
What do you suppose that is?
Looks like a mini-submarine.
A mini-sub with a maxi-captain.
Why don't we go down to breakfast and find out what it's all about?
It's a braw, bricht day.
Good morning to you both.
Morning, Robbie.
Morning, Robbie.
Baron, Mr. and Mrs. Stephens.
The Baron von Fuchs.
He's here with his submarine to take underwater photographs of the monster.
The innkeeper tells me you were this close to the monster.
That's right.
In that case, I will join you.
I would like to interrogate Uh.
Ask you some questions.
What does the monster look like?
Height, weight, color of eyes, complexion?
Any distinguishing characteristics?
How is he armed?
I thought you were here to take photographs of the monster.
That is only my cover.
Actually, Boyd's of London Insurance Company has a $3 million reward for his capture.
And it would give me great pleasure to take money from the English.
Well, good luck.
But luck has nothing to do with this.
What has to do with this is strategy, a trained regiment A crew and our secret weapon.
You mean the submarine?
This is only part of the equipment.
We do it with laser beams.
We divert the monster from the front outflank him from the side and with our electronical laser beam we give him a good shot in the rear.
He will be stunned into submission.
Excuse me.
Uh, is there any danger?
To the crew, no.
To the monster, maybe.
You mean, there's a chance he might be stunned into extinction.
What has the monster got to worry?
He can only lose his life.
I could lose $3 million.
I've just lost my appetite.
Excuse me.
Okay, Sam, what's wrong?
I just found the baron very questionable.
Oh, come on, Sam.
He's a joke.
He's a monster-killer, that's what he is.
Uh, sweetheart, I have a little headache and I think I'd like to lie down.
Why don't you go for a hike in the heather?
I'm not in a heather-hiking mood.
The truth is gonna come as a shock to you.
Try me.
The monster is not a monster.
You're right.
It comes as a shock to me.
His name is Bruce.
He's a warlock friend of Serena's from way back.
He adored her.
He was a sick warlock.
Well, she tried to maintain a She tried to maintain a brother-sister relationship with him, but he turned into one of those pests.
He kept hounding her, day and night.
And?
Well, as she put it, if he was going to behave like a monster he might as well look like one.
So she turned him into a monster.
She turned him into a monster.
Serena's the only one who can change him back.
Got to try and reach her.
I wish I'd taken that hike.
North, south, West and east.
SOS For the Loch Ness beast.
This, Serena Is a subpoena.
Well, you certainly picked a rotten time.
Hi there, tall, dark and nothing.
I was in the middle of an archeological expedition with the maharajah of Indipoor.
We were digging for diamonds in his vault.
Ha-ha-ha.
I'll send you back as soon as you take care of Bruce.
Bruce who?
Serena, you're in the town of Inverness on Loch Ness.
Bruce.
The ding-a-ling.
How is the little monster?
Well, he's in danger of being captured.
Who'd want him?
Or being killed.
That I can understand.
He was never that much of a pest.
Change him back.
Oh, very well.
I'll go down and take a walk on the lake.
I'll go with you, just to make sure you do it.
Whoa, nobody is going lake-walking while I'm around.
We'll take a boat.
Poop.
Far enough, gondolier.
Okay, get going, Serena, and don't waste any time down there.
Are you kidding?
I want to get back to my diamond-digging as quickly as possible.
Bruce.
Bruce.
Bruce.
Heigh-ho, Brucey.
You really should see a skin doctor.
Oh.
Groovy little undersea pad you have here.
Excuse me while I dry off.
There, that's better.
No, thank you.
Really, Brucey.
I just have to do what I came to do and then buzz off.
Well, the scuttlebutt is you're in danger of being captured.
Sammy thinks you should split this neighborhood.
The decision's up to you.
Yes or no?
Then here goes.
Oh, it's so corny, I could die.
Monster, monster of the deep Look into my eyes  And sleep.
When you awake At the count of three.
The warlock, Bruce Again you'll be.
One, two, three.
Oh.
Oh.
Hands.
Shoes.
Oh-h-h.
Oh.
You botched it.
I wasn't always this short.
Well, you haven't changed.
You're still a whiner.
Eh.
How do you like it?
How'd you get all this stuff down here?
I have a little witch in the neighborhood who happens to care a great deal about me.
Oh.
How is your mother?
I love when you insult me.
It's like old times again.
Can I offer you a little drink?
No.
Just say, "Thank you, Serena," and I will be on my way.
I'm not gonna say thank you until you have one drink with me.
Uh, aren't you gonna ask how I've been doing down here?
How have you been doing down here, Bruce?
Beautiful.
I was taking a medical course and in a year from now, I would have become a sturgeon.
I was just taking the course for the halibut.
One more joke like that and I'll see that you finish the course.
So be it.
A toast.
I've been rehearsing this for years.
Witch Serena Fair and sweet.
Oh, ha-ha, true.
I knew that once again We'd meet.
And I'd no longer Weep and wail.
Because my darling Has a tail  You double-crosser.
Ta-ta.
I'm off to find a A short girl at the Warlock Club party for singles over 2100.
Oh, oh.
Fink!
What's keeping her, Sam?
Maybe I ought to go below and investigate.
Absolutely not.
She's probably down there comparing notes with a man-eating shark.
Ship, ahoy!
There she is.
I got to admit, she swims like a fish.
Come on, Darrin, pull.
Pull.
I can't.
Kick your feet.
Don't touch me.
Ow.
What's the matter, haven't you ever seen a mermaid before?
Yes, but only on a can of tuna.
Talk about holding a grudge.
Oh, never mind, Serena, relax.
We'll think of something.
You already thought of something.
Look at me.
Oh, I was doing so well with my tap-dancing lessons.
Now what?
Get me back to the inn and into a warm tub.
To the inn?
We can't take you back there in your condition.
Well, what else can we do?
Throw her back in the lake?
Well You wait till I get my powers back, buster.
I was just trying to be helpful.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
No one will see us go back to the inn.
I'll just zap us to our room.
Don't touch.
Serena, will you please cover up?
What's to cover up anymore?
If you don't mind.
Serena, try to remember Bruce's spell.
Maybe I can reverse it.
Well, it went something like: Witch Serena Sweet and frail.
I'd like to grab you By the Oh, no.
That's not it.
It's no use.
Why don't we have her filleted and fried and put out of her misery?
That's two funnies I owe you.
Sweetheart, why don't you go down to the bar and relax?
We'll work this out.
That's the best suggestion I've heard so far.
Okay, time's a-wasting.
We've got to get Bruce back.
He's the only one who can help you.
And he's the only one who won't.
Well, we have to try.
Where did he say he was?
He said he'd be at the Warlock Club, a party for singles over 2100.
Let's see.
That's 36.6 degrees north by northwest on the cosmic continuum.
Warlock Bruce Of Loch Ness fame Sammy.
If I hear another incantation, I'm going to be sick.
Just turn on the power and get him here.
You're right.
You realize that you zapped me out of the semifinals of the tango contest?
I could have won.
I have a lovely dip.
Don't mention dip to me.
You poor dear.
Oh, you should be back in the lake.
Your scales are shedding.
And as for you, Samantha, I'm gonna report you to the Witches Council for the illegal use of teleportation spells.
Oh?
Well, how about your good deed for the day?
That's perfectly legal under the Laws of Revenge, article 33 B. Well, how about the Law of Mercy?
You said the magic word.
"Mercy".
I mean, why not?
We're grown-up, decent witches and warlocks.
Mercy it is.
Let's see, I was a monster for 40 years.
Forty years from now, I'll be merciful, but until then, happy swimming, little mermaid.
I told you he was a first-class stinker.
Mother always said forgive and forget.
Never liked Mother.
Sam, Robbie's on his way Serena, will you cover up your tail?
Uh, Darrin, this is Bruce.
Bruce, this is my husband, Darrin.
Bruce the monster?
Eh, the former monster.
Want my autograph?
I'd love it, but later.
Sam, we've gotta clear the area.
Robbie's on his way up and he He's here now, Darrin.
Hi, Samantha.
Are you feeling any better, lassie?
Miracles.
Europa Travel just called and booked the inn for a whole year.
Solid and glory be.
A television network is sending a special crew to televise the monster in action via Telstar.
Telstar?
Huh.
Imagine that.
Hurry.
Hurry now.
Hurry.
Oh, well.
I'll be getting back to my dance.
Poor Robbie.
He's in for an awful letdown.
Not necessarily.
Samantha, I'm I'm waiting.
I suppose the public would be satisfied with a mermaid.
There's no substitute for the Loch Ness monster.
Let's get at it, Samantha.
Back to my dance.
Introducing, for the first time in any loch, Serena, the mermaid.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, good thinking, Sammy.
Hold it.
What do you mean, "Serena the mermaid"?
Are you suggesting that a A mermaid can replace me?
I'll work up an act.
I can swim.
I can sit on the rocks and sing the song of Lorelei.
Ooh-ooh-ooh And for an encore, I can mess around with the fishermen.
Top that, you silly little beast.
Hey, Serena, I didn't realize you could do all that.
I may even take over your little underwater pad.
My place, huh?
Jacques Cousteau could drop in anytime.
Hold it a minute.
The truth is I've always been a bust as a warlock.
You're right, Serena, I'm too short.
I've got a rotten personality.
I'm a pest.
But in that lake, I'm a star.
He has a point.
The little twerp.
That's me, a little twerp.
I'd rather be a big monster.
But what about the baron?
Oh, I can take care of him.
Send me back, Serena, please.
How can I, in my condition?
Oh.
Sorry.
And now:  Your turn.
My pleasure.
And I hope the German gets you.
Well, sweetheart, you gonna miss all this?
Like I'm gonna miss earthquakes and tidal waves.
At ease.
Oh, well, thank you.
Uh, where have you been, baron?
In great danger at the bottom of the lake.
That's where I've been.
Look what that crazy monster did to me.
How did that happen?
I was in my little submarine minding my own business, on a search-and-destroy mission, when he attacked me from the rear.
Two bites and no more submarine.
He ate it like it was a piece of mackerel, but how I escaped, Himmler only knows.
I'm getting out of here.
Boyd's of London, you can take the $3 million in $1 bills and:  Wow.
Well, at least we know Bruce can take care of himself.
Yeah, we'd better get back to the inn and pack.
Oh, hi, Brucey.
Really?
Oh, well, I'm sorry to hear that.
Why, yeah, sure, right away.
You're welcome.
Well, what does he want?
Well, it-it seems the submarine didn't agree with him.
He wants me to get him a case of bicarbonate.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Ah.
The Leaning Tower of Pisa.
The greatest architectural goof of all time.
If you do this, everything else looks like it's leaning.
Oh, that's probably Larry.
He's supposed to be coming over with a client.
Hello.
Hello?
Okay, what's ringing?
Oh, look, this.
Hello.
Hello, Samantha.
How are you?
Fine.
How are you?
Miserable.
What's the matter?
I can't talk about it in front of him.
Darrin, would you mind?
Couldn't she use the phone?
I am using the phone.
Oh, brother.
All right, now what is it?
Hi, Mommy.
Aunt Hagatha's here.
She is?
What for?
That's why I called you.
I just can't baby-sit for you anymore so I've gotten Hagatha to take my place.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Well  Oh, hel Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Oh Oh, dear.
I must have broken the connection.
Hello?
I don't suppose it would occur to you to use the phone?
Telephone Upon the table.
Just as soon As you are able.
Send my voice to Sam in Pisa.
In the land Once ruled by Caesar.
Aunt Hagatha, Esmeralda pulled another goof.
They're ringing.
Hello, Samantha.
Hello, Esmeralda.
Now, look, I really don't want you to leave.
Sam.
Well, I don't.
Sam.
Oh.
Oh, my stars.
Esmeralda, you shouldn't have come here.
What makes you think I wanted to?
I just meant to send my voice, not all of me.
Esmeralda, will you tell us what's wrong?
I don't wanna talk about it, but as far as the vase is concerned, I want you to know I intend to replace it.
What vase?
The one your mother gave you for your anniversary.
What?
Oh, dear.
Esmeralda.
Now Now, stop that.
The truth is Darrin never really did like that vase.
He didn't?
Eh, no.
I hated it.
I'm glad.
How did it get broken?
There was water from the flowers in it and I used it to put out the living room curtain and it just slipped out of my hand.
Put out the curtain?
It was on fire?
No.
It was just smoking a little bit from where the dinosaur had scorched it.
Dinosaur?
Esmeralda, how did a dinosaur get into our living room?
And I know I'm going to be sorry I asked.
Well, you know Tabitha's little friend, Diana, from down the street?
Mm-hm.
Tabitha was teasing her, and I told her she was making Diana sore, and that's how it happened.
Diana sore.
Oh.
Di-na-saur.
Ah, ah.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
I'm sorry I barged in on you this way.
Believe me, this is the last place in the world I'd pick to come back to.
You've been here before?
When?
I'd rather not talk about it.
What happened here?
Well Have you noticed how that tower leans a little?
Yes, I-I noticed it in passing.
Why?
Who do you think did it?
You?
Y-You're responsible for the?
For the Leaning Tower?
Are you sure?
Oh, Samantha, when you pull a goof like that, you don't forget it.
Of course, I was just a girl at the time.
I couldn't have been more than 100.
Bonano had a fit.
Who?
Bonano Pisano, the man who built the Tower.
We were engaged.
Until I made the Tower lean.
After that, he wouldn't even talk to me.
Aw.
Oh, what a temper.
Sam?
Hm?
They're going to be here any minute.
Now, unless Esmeralda has some ideas on how to promote Count Bracini's olive oil in the United States, I'd appreciate your getting rid of her.
Oh, Darrin, I can't send her back to baby-sit.
She's too depressed.
Depressed?
She's downright dangerous.
Please, let her stay.
Just until I can restore her confidence.
If you can do it before Larry gets here with the count, okay.
I don't know whether I told you, Darrin brought his wife along.
She's a charming girl.
Esmeralda, what are you doing here?
Good grief.
Hi, Larry.
Look who dropped in.
I'm looking.
I'm looking.
Count Bracini, may I present Mrs. Stephens?
You know Darrin, of course.
And this is a friend of the family, Esmeralda.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid my Italian's a little rusty.
I haven't used it in over 800  Esmeralda.
Uh, the count would like you to go with us to see the sights.
Me?
Really?
Si, si.
But I insist.
Oh.
Eh.
Uh-uh.
Uh, Esmeralda, you're not gonna do anything foolish.
I can't help it.
Come with me for a moment, count.
Larry.
What?
Over here.
I thought she was home with the kids.
Well, she She was.
She was.
But she needed a vacation, so she flew over.
Just make sure she doesn't show up on your expense account.
I-I wanted to tell you how terrific.
I-I think your olive oil is.
I just use it on everything.
Is it a secret?
No.
No.
A-And it certainly won't be when-when Darrin gets his new campaign started.
We'd better get back to the count.
And I'm looking forward to Did you see that?
See-See what?
What happened to her?
Oh, Did-did she look for a minute like she wasn't here?
Yes.
Oh.
Well, that's Esmeralda for you.
The dear girl's so shy and retiring.
That is indeed very shy.
Young lady, to be shy in this day and age is a thing to be cherished.
Never lose it.
Shall we all go?
All?
But of course.
At the last measurement the Tower was but why the Tower leans we don't really know.
They say that Bonano Pisano, the first builder, did it purposely to gain attention to his work.
Ha.
You are familiar with the history of the Leaning Tower?
Am I familiar with it?
Well, let me put it this way.
No.
Oh, Esmeralda has such a sly sense of humor.
Oh, a joke.
I see.
What was the joke?
Now, who are the brave ones who are going to climb the Tower?
Oh, well, I think we're all up to that.
Not me.
Once is enough.
You've been to the Tower before?
When was that?
Back in the beginning Of last year.
I think the signorina and I have a better chance to get acquainted.
Shall we go to the cafÃ© for a little tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte?
TÃªte-Ã -tÃªte.
I'd love some.
It's my favorite Italian dish.
Ha-ha-ha.
Esmeralda, you're a riot.
I see.
A joke.
What was the joke?
You will do me the honor of having dinner with me.
Now?
Before lunch?
Che buffa, she never stops, does she?
No.
With her it's buffa, buffa, buffa all day long.
Speaking of lunch, after you climb the Tower, you will join us in the cafÃ©?
Well, actually, I've been to the top of the Tower, so I I think I'll go with you.
Me too.
So long, Larry.
Well, wait a minute.
All this talk of climbing has given me a terrific appetite.
Count.
If you'll excuse us, we'll go out on the patio.
Okay.
I don't understand these Europeans.
Before talking business he insists he takes us sightseeing.
We didn't even get a chance to talk to him at lunch.
Well, the Italians don't like to rush things.
No wonder Rome wasn't built in a day.
Well, Esmeralda, you certainly hit the jackpot.
Two dates on your first day here.
I know.
Isn't it awful?
I think it's terrific.
You're getting your confidence back.
After all, the count promised us a half an hour when he comes to pick Esmeralda up for dinner.
Big deal.
What are we gonna do in the meantime?
Let's turn on TV and see what the Italians are doing in the way of TV commercials.
Never mind the commercials.
See if you can find a Sophia Loren movie.
I feel I feel as though I could do anything.
And you know what I'd like to start with?
That goof.
My first and my worst.
Well, Esmeralda, I think it's a little late for that.
Sam?
I'll be right back.
It's never too late.
Larry has a good idea.
He wants Esmeralda to be late getting ready for her date.
My heart is light My spirit sore.
Maybe we can stretch our half-hour business discussion into an hour.
Tower that leans.
Lean no more.
Uh, I'll talk to her.
Esmeralda, what are you doing?
You know you're not I did it.
I did it.
I'm cured.
Shh!
Yeah.
You're cured.
And I'm sick.
Do you think Mr. Stephens will be mad about what I did?
Only if he finds out about it.
Oh.
Esmeralda, you put that tower back the way it was before the whole town wigs out.
Which I'm sure it already has.
Well, wouldn't they rather have a tower that stands straight?
Esmeralda.
Thousands and thousands of people come here to see the Tower lean.
If it were straight.
Pisa would be just another place with a nice church.
What is that all about?
I don't know.
Something about the Leaning Tower.
Some kind of emergency.
You know, in Italian, everything sounds like an emergency.
Even when I finally do something right, it turns out wrong.
Now, look, just sit down and concentrate.
Now.
How did you make that tower lean in the first place?
I Well, I used to bring Bonano his lunch every day and it seems to me that I Oh, dear, I just don't remember.
Try.
Do you think it's easy to remember something you've been trying to forget for hundreds of years?
Well, let's see.
It has something to do with bringing Bonano his lunch.
I know.
I know.
I'll send you back to that time.
Sort of a re-enactment of the crime.
Oh.
I-I mean incident.
Well, I couldn't possibly go alone.
What if I got stuck back in time?
Although, it couldn't be worse than the present.
Okay, I'll go with you.
Sam?
Did you see what happened to the Tower?
Probably due to a tremor.
You know something?
We're never going to be able to talk business with the count while this is going on.
Larry, don't you feel like a drink?
I certainly do.
Sam?
Mm-hm?
Am I correct in assuming what I'm assuming?
Well, I'm afraid so, but I think I have the solution.
What's that?
Esmeralda and I are going for a little walk.
Where?
Down memory lane.
Now, you go and have a drink with Larry.
But We'll be back in a minute.
Now, we have no time to lose.
Oh.
Come on.
You ready?
No, but let's go anyway.
Well, first, we'll need some traveling clothes.
Sam, it's just beautiful.
There's nothing like old-fashioned clothes.
And, oh, you look lovely.
Yeah, well, thank you.
Now, that's enough.
That's enough.
Time and tide Wind and sea.
Back to Bonano's age go we.
Master builder Cursed by fate.
Esmeralda's ancient date  There he is.
Hello, Bonano.
I'm busy.
Just leave my lunch on the scaffold.
Aren't you even going to say hello?
Hello.
He's not much of a talker, is he?
Ah, well, well, well.
I didn't know that you brought company.
Just like old times.
I am Bonano Pisano.
Master builder.
I am famous throughout Italy.
I am a genius.
My work is half my life.
Well, if this is the other half, forget it.
How about joining me for lunch?
What did you bring?
Well, I didn't have a chance to get it.
What would you like?
Mm.
A couple of those Tower specials of yours.
Roast beef, Swiss cheese and turkey.
You will love it.
Be sure and make the roast beef lean.
Right.
One Tower and make it lean.
I'm ruined.
What will I tell everybody?
Maybe they won't notice.
Come on, we gotta fly.
Believe me, trying to talk to Count Bracini now is like trying to do business during an earthquake.
The man simply isn't in the mood to   Oh, Count Bracini, we were just talking about you.
I'm afraid I have but a moment.
I come to explain to the signorina why I cannot have dinner with her and to say goodbye.
You're leaving?
Yes.
I am flying to Rome.
I've a meeting with the Minister of the Interior concerning the Tower.
Now, gentlemen, I know I have neglected our business together and for this, I apologize.
Oh, that's perfectly all right.
And where is Esmeralda?
Here she is.
Signorina, I am obliged to go to Rome.
I wish to say goodbye and to express my  It's leaning!
Well, how about that?
How can that be?
Whatever straightened it, obviously made it lean again.
Well, that's my guess too.
So now that everything is straightened out or rather now that it's back to not being straight, can we sit down and talk about your account?
Impossible.
Why?
Who knows how the Tower has suffered from the result of these changes?
It doesn't look like it's suffering to me.
Not half as much as I am.
I must go to the mayor's office immediately and discuss with the city engineers.
Excuse me.
You know something?
I'm beginning to wish I'd never heard of the Leaning Tower.
I've been wishing that for 800 years.
What?
Uh, what she means is that Is that when you're depressed life just seems that long.
Oh.
Now, what have you got to say?
Uh, h-how about, um: Hello, Esmeralda.
Arrivederci, Pisa.
Esmeralda, you have simply got to stop blaming yourself.
There are some things that are beyond our control.
Everything's beyond my control.
I'd be better off just giving up and turning myself into something harmless.
Maybe a bird.
Or a zebra.
I've always looked good in stripes.
With your luck, you'd probably wind up a zebra with feathers.
Then you agree?
No.
No, I didn't mean that.
I just Sam, the count's back.
He just drove up.
The news is terrifico.
The Tower's okay?
Yes.
The engineers have checked, and the Tower is as strong as ever.
Oh, did you hear that, Sam?
Did you hear that, Esmeralda?
But what is really stupendous is the reaction around the world.
The interest, the concern, headlines in all the newspapers, and they predict that our tourism will double in the coming year.
Well.
So, actually, it was all a blessing, wasn't it?
Exactly.
Oh, that's terrifico.
See?
Your Italian's coming back.
Si.
Now can we sit down and talk business?
Business?
At a time like this?
Of course not.
We are going to celebrate.
There is a party at my house.
Come, cara mia.
Oh.
Well, we might as well join them.
Yeah, but what are we celebrating?
Oh, did you see the look in Esmeralda's eyes?
I'm so happy for her.
Do you see the look in my eyes?
Oh, yes.
The left one does look a wee bit angry so I think I'll just ignore that one for the time being.
Buffa, buffa?
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
And here, ladies and gentlemen, is the famous Galafedgio Venus.
Also known as Aphrodite.
Also known as big, big troublemaker.
Ah, Venus, the goddess of love.
The high priestess of hanky-panky.
And now, a special treat for the ladies.
Come this way.
Galafedgio Adonis.
Mythology's strongest man and greatest lover.
He had to be.
He was the boyfriend of Venus.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, follow me upstairs, and we will visit with the great works of the Renaissance.
This is where we came in.
Let's split.
Oh.
Aren't they adorable?
I like your kind of doll better.
I think she's cute too.
Tell me I didn't hear anything.
Mother.
Where?
Where?
Now, that's what I call bad casting.
Your mother as a doll.
Mother, what are you doing in Rome?
What are you doing in Rome?
I thought you were staying in Pisa.
Well, we We are.
We have a lovely villa.
But Darrin had a business appointment this afternoon so we thought we'd do a little sightseeing.
Oh.
And what's more important, who's home minding the children?
Esmeralda is covering for me.
And Tabitha wanted spaghetti for lunch.
Why didn't you go to the market like anybody else?
I'm not like anybody else.
Nor are my grandchildren.
When they want Italian spaghetti, they get Italian spaghetti.
But, Mother, you promised.
Speaking of promises, I almost forgot.
I-I made a promise to the children that I would kiss their mama and their papa for them.
Er Well, half a promise is better than none.
I appreciate that, Endora.
I have a business luncheon, and I don't want to lose my appetite.
I better get going.
See you back at the villa, honey.
Ciao.
And it's always a pleasure to say goodbye to you, Endora.
Oh, my.
What big eyes he has.
Mother, what's the real reason you're in Rome?
That's the reason.
A mortal creature like Durwood, transplanted from his quarter acre of suburban crabgrass to this romantic Roman carnival, can go bananas.
And I don't want my little girl to get hurt.
Ahh, well, I appreciate the concern, mamma mia.
It's been nice chatting with you.
But we're having guests for the weekend, so I have to do the marketing.
Arrivederci.
Arrivederci?
Oh, you poor, trusting child.
When will you ever learn that Mother knows best?
And what Mother knows best is how to prove she's right.
Marble Venus though you be.
I'll take thy marble heart From thee.
And turn it into Flame and fire.
To light a mortal man's Desire  Oh.
That feels so good.
You'll feel even better when you're properly dressed.
What is this I'm wearing?
A woman's greatest weapon: A clinging dress.
You look stunning in it.
Oh, I know, I know.
But how did you do it and why?
Well, "how," it's just a little parlor trick.
"Why," I'll tell you as soon as we get out of here.
Oh.
Half a moment, dear.
Now you won't be missed for hours.
Come along, dear.
Oh, mi scusi, I did not know this table was occupied.
I'm sorry.
No, don't go.
I'd be honored if you'd join me.
Grazie.
Ahhh.
How charming you are.
Ah, thank you.
I feel charming.
I don't mean I feel charming, I mean, I'm charmed by your Your eyes.
You have the most remarkable eyes.
Green, aren't they?
That is your favorite color?
Yeah.
Then they are green.
Ahem.
So this is Rome.
Non Ã¨ vero.
This is tourist Rome.
May I show you the real Rome?
W-would you?
That would be very nice.
But impossible.
I have this business meeting with my boss and a client.
It's very important.
It is so important?
But not that important.
Let's go.
And it's not as though Larry can't talk to the client by himself.
Well, if he is the boss, he certainly should be able to, no?
Oui.
Si.
Good morning.
Mmmm.
Molto fantastico.
Ah, grazie, grazie.
MR.
I'm Mr. Tate.
Hi, Sam.
How's Darrin?
Will he live?
Uh  Grazie, signora, grazie.
What are you talking about?
He didn't show up for the meeting with Baldoni.
So I can only conclude he was in some terrible accident.
And if he wasn't, he's gonna wish he were.
Hello.
I'm home.
Hi, Larry.
Sweetheart.
Sam, the most amazing thing happened to me.
Let me guess.
You were kidnapped, and you escaped.
Anything less, I won't accept.
Uh, no.
What happened was, er, I bumped into this Italian.
But, Darrin, you had a business appointment with Larry and Mr. Baldoni.
Oh, don't worry, Larry.
Baldoni and his wife are driving up for dinner and to spend the weekend.
We'll make it up to them then.
That's your whole explanation?
Well, uh a-after I bumped into this Italian we sort of took a walk.
Oh.
Well, is there anything wrong with an American tourist trying to make a good impression on his European cousin?
We, uh, e-exchanged ideas.
You know, it's really quite sad.
Do you realize how hard it is for a European to get a working visa in the United States if you don't have a job waiting for you?
This Italian cousin of yours, what sort of work does she do?
Did I say it was a she?
You didn't say it was a he, so I figured it had to be a she.
Oh.
A lady cousin.
Uh, yeah.
Heh.
Uh, anyway, um, I thought you could use some help with the dinner party tonight.
The villa comes with four in-help.
Oh, I figured that's what you'd say.
But actually it's not so much for tonight, I was thinking of taking her home with us.
Home?
Where we live?
Well, sure.
You could use some help around the house.
Just temporarily, of course, till she got settled.
Anyway, uh, she, uh She's waiting outside.
Oh.
Oh, well, uh, show her in.
I guess that's the, uh, courteous thing to do, huh?
Heh-heh!
Excuse me.
Vanessa, come in, please.
Uh, Vanessa, this is my, uh Uh Wife.
Wife.
And I'm, uh Uh Larry Tate.
Buongiorno.
Buongiorno.
Oh, I'm so delighted to meet you all.
And I accept the position.
You've had experience as a housekeeper?
No.
Well, that's perfect, Sam.
That means she hasn't developed any bad habits.
Heh!
We can break her in just the way we want her.
Darrin, could I speak to you privately?
Sorry.
Mine won't take long.
Excuse me.
Heh.
Come on.
Uh, y-you'll be serving tonight.
So why don't you go into the kitchen, and one of the girls can find you an apron.
I have to go upstairs and take care of something.
Si, signora.
Mother, you show up here pronto.
I don't know what you're up to or who that girl is, but you're not proving anything.
A monk wouldn't be safe with her.
"Monk or monkey, what's the difference"?
Oh.
Sam, I've been talking to Larry and he's concerned.
And what he's concerned about is that you're concerned.
But it's really nothing to be concerned about.
I'm not concerned.
Now, look, I realize Vanessa is not your average maid.
You can bet my sweet mother she isn't.
What's that supposed to mean?
I-I'm not sure what it is, but there's something very strange about her.
And it's quite possible that Mother's weird sense of humor is hard at work.
Yes?
It is me, signora.
I want you to see how I look in the apron.
Oh, uh, come in, Vanessa.
Do I look all right?
Uh, well, uh, Vanessa, when I said an apron.
I-I didn't mean just an apron.
Now, why don't you be a good girl and go out.
Backwards.
And we'll make sure you get a uniform to go with that apron.
Si, signora.
Doesn't that tell you anything?
It just means she's inexperienced.
She may be many things, Darrin, but inexperienced is not one of them.
Signor Baldoni, a thousand apologies for missing this afternoon's appointment.
Grazie.
Uh, but you see, uh, I was waylaid At the Vatican, waiting to see the Pope.
Oh.
In that case, you will forgive him, Ernesto, huh?
If your advertising is as imaginative as your excuses, then the House of Baldoni will do very well in America.
Uh, well, please, come on in.
Thank you.
Mr. and Mrs. Baldoni, this is my wife, Samantha.
How do you do?
It is a pleasure.
Hi, Sam.
And our maid, Vanessa.
Hello, Vanessa.
Nice to see you again.
Nice to see you.
May I fix our guest a cocktail?
Martini for me.
I will have a glass of water.
I'll have a martini with a twist of legs.
Lemon.
I've never seen such beautiful hazel eyes.
They're brown.
They're green.
They are hazel.
Come on, I'll prove it to you.
Excuse me, Mrs. Stephens, but does your maid come with the villa?
Uh, not really.
She's a friend of the family.
I would rather have Lucrezia Borgia as a friend.
They're definitely hazel.
Brown.
They're green and stop crowding her.
Uh, call me if If one of them suggests playing spin the bottle.
Spin the bottle?
Just an American joke.
I think.
Hello?
Si.
Si.
Signor Baldoni, it's for you.
Oh.
Scusi.
Sweetheart.
Grazie.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Guido.
What?
H-how?
Why was I not informed sooner?
I appreciate it, Guido.
This is fantastic.
What has happened, Ernesto?
That was Guido Compapasso.
See, he is the Director of the National Museum, and I am on the board of trustees.
He has just informed me that the statue of Venus, the Galafedgio Venus, has been stolen in broad daylight.
MR.
It is the crime of the century.
Uh, w-w-would you all excuse me, please?
Crimes of the century give me a headache.
Mother.
Mother.
I know who Vanessa is, and you know who Vanessa is, and I want Vanessa like Vanessa was, and I want it now.
"Patience is its own reward.
Remember, Mother knows best".
What Mother knows best is how to cause a lot of trouble.
Sam, what's wrong with you?
We have guests.
I know.
And we also have a maid who happens to be the crime of the century.
Hm?
Venus.
The goddess of love.
The one we saw at the museum this afternoon.
Mother zapped her into human form.
Are you sure?
It's a wise daughter who knows her own mother.
If she has that effect on me, what about Larry and?
And Mr. Baldoni?
Oh  MRS.
Ernesto, what do you think you are doing?
I am only reading her palm.
In a minute you'll be reading the back of my hand.
Why is she fooling around with him, if I'm supposed to be her pigeon?
Fooling around is her business.
Is there any way you can put her out of business?
Maybe.
A quick trip to Rome.
Sweetheart, you go down there and try to keep everything under control.
Uh, including yourself.
Ciao.
Though of marble you be carved For a woman you are starved.
So back you go To flesh and sinew.
The fairest of them all Will win you  Oh.
Ha-ha!
Forget it, Adonis.
I am not the fairest of them all.
Well, you will do until something better comes along.
Something better is waiting for you at my villa.
Well, I guess I'll have to get you into some decent clothes.
Who are you?
A matchmaker.
And have I got a match for you.
Of course, as the House of Baldoni's goodwill ambassador, you will have an unlimited expense account in the finest hotels in Europe.
And, uh, every once in a while, I might join you in Zurich or Paris.
Yes, of course.
After you have come out of the hospital.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baldoni, but I have Vanessa under exclusive contract as a maid.
Besides, Vanessa, you wouldn't want to break up a happy marriage.
Oh.
However, my marriage could stand a little breaking.
How would you like to be my private secretary?
Larry, does she look like a private secretary to you?
Well, she looks more like a private secretary than she does a maid.
Well, I don't care what she looks like, I saw her first.
Hi.
Oh, Adonis.
Venus.
What did they call each other?
Venus and Adonis.
Pet names.
This is Alberto, Mr. and Mrs. Baldoni, my husband Darrin and his business associate Larry Tate.
Mr. and Mrs. Baldoni, I'd like you to meet Alber to.
Alberto.
Alberto.
What a beautiful young man you are.
I have never seen such eyes.
What color are they?
What is your favorite color, signora?
Black.
And they are black.
Like the velvet night.
Isabella, you are making a fool of yourself.
Me?
And what about you, you old goat?
Who are you calling an old goat?
Me.
She was looking at me when she said that.
You're right, signora.
The pretty faces turn my head.
I should be ashamed of myself.
Sam, why don't you take the lovebirds out in the garden so they can have a little more privacy?
Right.
Uh, come on, you crazy kids.
Mother.
Mother.
It's now or never.
Please.
Pretty please?
I'm so sorry for the delay, darling.
Shh.
But I was waiting for Esmeralda to return.
Mother, never mind.
We have to get those statues back where they belong.
Oh?
They seem to be very happy where they are.
Mother, that's Adonis.
I got him to run a little pass interference for Darrin.
Copycats.
Okay, okay.
Okay, fun and games are over.
Break it up, you two, we have to send you back.
All right, Mother, together now.
One, two and three.
Mother.
Oh, Mother, we can't send them back like that.
Why not?
I think it's sweet.
What are people gonna say when they see those two statues holding hands?
Nothing.
What's one more miracle in the enchanted city of Rome?
Ciao.
Where are Venus and what's-his-name?
Adonis and what's-her-name are back in the museum.
You gotta admit, that goddess was some goddess.
And you are to be congratulated for putting up what little struggle you put up to resist her.
Well, it wasn't easy.
For a while there, it was, uh, touch-and-go.
Touch what and go where?
Sam.
Well?
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
The Arc de Triomphe.
You know, we ought to send the kids some picture postcards of the sights.
Good idea.
"Dear Tabitha and Adam" Sam, what are you doing?
Just what you suggested, sending some postcards.
I'd prefer you use the regular mail.
When you're a witch, that is the regular mail.
Yes, yes.
It's a big doggy, isn't it?
It's a big doggy and house.
That's right.
Oh!
Oh, how nice!
Postcards from your mama.
Come on.
Dear Tabitha and Adam, we are now passing the Arc de Triomphe, which is at the other end of the Champs ElysÃ©es.
You children have a very thoughtful mama.
And here we are at Cleopatra's Needle.
That's a big needle.
What does it sew?
This is the famous Louvre museum.
It was originally built almost 900 years ago.
Imagine that.
I don't have to imagine it.
I was there when they laid the cornerstone.
In front of the Louvre are the beautiful Luxembourg Gardens.
That sounds like a visit from your grandpapa.
You children stay here and enjoy Mama's postcards.
Now, stay there.
How do you like it?
Love it.
Love Paris.
Love you.
Oh, well, stay a while.
I can't.
I've got to run down to the printer's and pick up some artwork.
I'm meeting with the Europa Tour people this afternoon.
I promised Larry I'd make a stab at getting the account.
Bye.
Darrin?
Hm?
Uh, I was thinking again about, uh visiting Daddy.
Shouldn't we stop off and see him in London?
Sure.
When we go back to London, we'll stop off to see him.
Well, it's only 45 minutes by plane.
Now, honey, you know I've got business here in Paris.
Your father will just have to wait till we get around to him.
Bye.
Or until he gets around to you.
Mother, what are you doing here?
Don't worry.
Esmeralda is with the children.
This is a red alert.
Your father popped in back home to see you.
Uh-oh.
He knows we're in Europe.
How did he take it?
Oh, he was very calm.
The way Vesuvius was calm just before it erupted and buried Pompeii.
Oh.
Well, this is part work and part vacation for Darrin.
Now, Daddy will just have to be understanding and reasonable.
I've heard your father called many things, but "understanding" and "reasonable" were not among them.
Here he comes.
And he looks mad.
Well, Daddy always was one for dramatic entrances.
Endora.
Pretty fast for a witch of your vintage.
I caught a tailwind.
Well, I'd appreciate it if you caught a tailwind out of here.
No, a mother's place is by her child.
How are you, Daddy?
In excellent health, thank you.
Of course.
He wouldn't have it any other way.
Certainly not.
Let's not pretend you don't know why I'm here.
Uh, look, Daddy.
I want you to know that Darrin and I had every intention of  Silence.
I'm not blaming you.
On the way over, I had time to think.
You are innocent.
It's that mortal you're married to who is guilty.
He is the worm in the apple of my eye.
That worm That man happens to be my husband.
And he's kind, and he's sweet, and he's gentle.
Ha!
Gentle.
The gentle mind by gentle deeds is known.
For a man by nothing is so well betrayed as by his manners.
Who'd you crib that one from?
Silence!
I am rolling.
Hath not a father eyes?
Hath not a father hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?
If you prick us, do we not bleed?
If you tickle us, do we not laugh?
If you poison us, do we not die?
And if you wrong us, shall we not revenge?
Don't worry.
It's a dummy Darwin.
Not too different from the real thing.
Farewell!
Bravo, Maurice!
Thank you.
Maurice, is that you?
Maurice, you look marvelous.
Naturally.
Have you any final words to say before I zap you into outer Darrin, Daddy is very angry with you.
And he has every right to be.
We should have at least called him in London, but, well, that would have given away our little surprise.
And we wouldn't want to do that, would we, sweetheart?
Uh, no, no, we wouldn't want to do that.
Actually, we should've called you while in London.
To pay our heartfelt respects.
But, now, we weren't about to come empty-handed.
And to buy a gift for someone with your exquisite sense of beauty takes time.
And Pablo doesn't work fast.
Pablo?
Pablo.
Picasso?
Oh, what a remarkable likeness.
Yes, Daddy.
Mr. Picasso really caught the strength of character in your face.
Do you really think so?
Yes, I suppose he has.
And the look of forgiveness in the eyes.
In those eyes perhaps, not in these.
Maurice, why can't you be gracious and just say thank you for the gift?
It's very hard to be gracious when you've worked yourself into a rage.
Frankly, I would rather face your anger than receive a compliment from the Queen herself, because an angry word from you is a far greater compliment than Go on.
Go on.
I can't.
I might sound insincere.
Nonsense.
The truth never sounds insincere.
I think it would look fantastic over the mantelpiece.
I ordered a halo, but Pablo must have forgotten.
Let's not overdo.
The painting is flattering enough.
Yes, a little too flattering for my taste.
Eh, Dustin, go into the other room.
I want to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
I am honored, sir.
Daddy, what are you going to do?
Do you know?
He's changed.
For the better, I hope.
In some ways, yes.
For instance, he has a keener appreciation of me.
Yet, somehow I feel I've broken the poor chap's spirit.
Oh, well, don't worry about that.
He's very pliable.
Almost too pliable.
He needs straightening out.
How long are you going to keep this up, Mother?
For as long as Maurice remains in residence.
Pull up a chair, lad.
Oh, yes, sir.
It's all very well to appreciate your betters, but you mustn't tear yourself down in the process.
You have some redeeming features, no matter how miniscule.
I take that as a tremendous compliment, sir.
It is not a tremendous compliment.
As a matter of fact, it's very close to being an insult.
Oh.
Forgive me if I insulted you, sir.
You did not insult me.
I insulted you.
Oh.
Thank you.
You're overdoing it.
Well, I'll try and turn the robot down a bit.
Endora?
What is she doing here?
Mother just had to stop off at her dressmaker's, but don't worry about the children.
Esmeralda's filling in.
Why is she keeping her eyes closed?
Why not?
I've seen Paris.
Why don't you fix yourself a drink?
Is that gonna help?
Let me put it this way.
It'll help you not care.
Experience tells me it's time for a drink.
One of them has got to go.
Get rid of yours.
Yours is easier.
All right.
What are you two whispering about?
Sweetheart, please, I I need your help.
For what?
You've got to help me get rid of you.
What?
In spite of the fact that you have  Now the boy needs burping.
I'll get a glass of water.
Now, sweetheart, just trust me.
When you see Daddy, don't act surprised.
Just be nice and go along with everything he says.
Dustin?
Ah, there you are, my boy.
Yes.
Uh, here I am.
I see you needed something stronger than water.
Uh, yeah, I usually do in these kind of situations.
He has a headache.
Headaches give him a terrible thirst.
Oh, yeah.
Er, terrible thirst.
Feeling a bit better?
Mm-hm.
Uh, how about you?
I beg your pardon?
Well, I mean, uh, you look as though you're in good shape.
I am in no better or worse shape than I was when I first arrived.
Strange that you should comment on that again.
Oh, Maurice, leave him alone.
He forgot.
So Uh, been in Paris for long?
Methinks something is rotten in the state of Paris.
This is no time for  This is no time for double-talk.
Now, then, let's sort some things out.
When did you get here, Maurice?
When did I get here?
Have I heard correctly?
No.
No, what he actually meant Silence.
When did you get here?
Two minutes ago, from a business meeting with the president of Europa Tours.
He was going to drop by here in a little while.
Two minutes ago?
Endora, can you explain?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it may incriminate me.
It was just an innocent, little practical joke, Daddy.
I'll do the jokes around here, young lady.
Look, I don't know what's going on, and, frankly, I don't care.
I am here on business, and in-between, Sam and I are trying to see the sights of Paris.
Alone.
Oh.
So you want to see the sights of Paris?
Alone.
Well, so be it.
No!
Oh!
Oh, Daddy!
What did you do with him?
He's seeing the sights of Paris.
Huh?
Would you like to see him seeing Paris?
Oh, my stars!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Daddy!
Endora, I'm really disappointed in you.
If you wanted to counterfeit the chap, I should've expected a little more subtlety.
It was subtle enough to fool you.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I saw through him at once.
I was merely toying with him.
Why don't you go away and toy with someone your own size?
No.
No, I'm going to stay right here until they get back.
I want to have one final word with Dobbin.
Easy, sweetheart.
Well.
Daddy, I thought you would have been gone by now.
Of course.
I only stayed to give Dobbin the opportunity to apologize.
Wha?
You expect me to apologize to you?
For what?
What's the difference?
Apologize.
No, I am sick and tired of being the source of your father's warped sense of humor.
Darrin!
Maurice, you have turned me into a monkey, a donkey, a raven and a pair of old galoshes.
And why?
Because, in some ways, I don't measure up to your idea of a son-in-law.
Well, let me tell you something, Maurice.
You leave a lot to be desired as a father-in-law.
I'm glad you said that, Dustin.
Darrin.
I stand corrected.
Sorry.
Dustin, what you have just said so eloquently convinces me that you're not entirely lacking in character.
I like that in a chap.
Maurice, watch your temper.
It also shows spunk.
I like that too.
Another necessary quality, however, is discretion.
The ability to restrain oneself from committing insult totally and beyond recall.
Although I appreciate a mortal who speaks his own mind, it is the height of insolence to speak it to me.
Daddy, we'll be thrown out of the hotel.
When I have finished, there may not be a hotel.
Very good, Endora.
What have you done with him?
None of your business.
Endora!
Perhaps you frighten Samantha, but you certainly don't frighten me.
I'll find him.
Mon gÃ©nÃ©ral.
Ohhh!
You sneak.
You really did it this time.
Daddy, how could you?
Well, it does seem rather a shame.
He was beginning to shape up.
You put him back the way you found him, or I'll never speak to you again.
Temper, temper.
She inherits that from you, poor child.
Oh, perhaps I was a little harsh.
Arise, thou miserable mortal!
Never mind the editorial comments.
Arise!
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
You can do it.
Woe is me.
I gave him a powerful blast.
I don't think I'm strong enough at the moment to bring him back.
You bring him back now!
You're a hard girl, Samantha.
Stand back.
'Tis is a far, far better thing I do than I have ever done before.
Oh, stop hamming it up and get to it.
Oh, very well.
The spell of spells.
The incantation of incantations.
Gaze upon this creature frightening.
Rise, thou mortal who doth quiver!
That's an order.
Now, deliver!
I tried.
I tried.
Devil knows I tried.
Well, at least, I've got this thought to comfort me: 'Tis better to have tried and lost than never to have tried at all.
That doesn't comfort me one bit.
He's done his best.
I don't believe it.
I don't think he really  Samantha, you show a shocking lack of faith in your progenitor's word.
He's done his best.
Now, you've just been running around too much, and your powers have waned.
You see, dear, Mummy understands.
So, as a wife, my duty is to move back in with you and nurse you back to full health.
Move back in with me?
Oh, no, no.
No, no.
No, I couldn't let you make that kind of sacrifice.
I shall try to summon the last bit of strength that I have.
Pull yourself together, man.
Oh, sweetheart, are you all right?
Of course.
I always get blown up this time of day.
Darrin.
Mmm.
Daddy didn't want to leave before he apologized to you.
Go ahead, Maurice.
Oh, very well.
Dustin, I apologize that your abominable behavior has so exhausted my patience that I was goaded into a slight transgression.
That's an apology?
For Daddy, it is.
Now, isn't this nice?
We're one big happy family.
Ha!
Omit the "happy," and you're near the mark.
I remember saying to Oscar Wilde once, and he quoted me well, that children begin by loving their parents.
After a time, they judge them.
Rarely ever do they forgive them.
I forgive you, Daddy.
Good.
I feel my appetite returning.
How about dinner over at Maxim's?
Lovely.
Terrific!
Who is it?
MAN Monsieur Sagan.
Oh, it's Sagan of Europa Tours.
I forgot all about him.
I wonder why.
Monsieur Sagan, what a pleasant surprise.
I'd like you to meet my wife, Samantha.
Bonsoir, monsieur.
And my parents.
Are they going to discuss business before dinner?
Barbaric, but it's the mortal way.
Monsieur Stephens, how could you do it?
What did I do?
Oh, brother.
How can I entrust Europa Tours to a company whose executive would do a thing like this?
The top of the Eiffel Tower.
Why?
That's a very good question.
Uh-huh, and unless you can give a very good answer, our relationship is at an end.
Let me look at that.
Perhaps I can be of some help.
Eh, that's not necessary, Daddy.
Yes, it is.
I'm starved.
Bully for you, boy.
It's a splendid notion.
It is?
Oh, now, don't be modest.
Wasn't exactly my idea.
Always give credit where credit is due.
I like that in you, boy.
Actually, we collaborated on it.
But examine this carefully, Monsieur Sagan.
A tourist clinging to the top of the Eiffel Tower and underneath, the slogan, "Europa Tours: Towers above them all".
I like it.
It shows great imagination.
Well, that's what McMahon and Tate is noted for.
Imagination.
And no fear of height.
And now, Monsieur Sagan, if you'll excuse us, we must get ready for dinner.
Yes, yes, of course.
You will drop by the office tomorrow to sign the contracts.
Fantastic slogan.
Pardon.
Au rev  I don't believe it.
What's not to believe?
We always dress for dinner.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Boy, will I be glad to get home.
The next time Larry offers you a vacation with a little business on the side, we'll know what he really means is a "little" vacation.
But I do feel a little guilty about dumping that Regal Silverware account in Larry's lap.
If it's in Larry's lap, what's it doing in your mind?
And  And that's probably Larry.
Oh, he doesn't have the nerve.
Or does he?
He does.
Look what just flew in.
Oh!
Surprise!
Fellow travelers, have I got terrific news for you.
We're all going to spend the weekend with nobility as guests of the Duke of Whitset at his castle.
Uh, Larry, you must be joking.
Yesterday, we agreed that Sam and I would fly home this afternoon and you would stay over to handle the Regal Silverware account.
Well, that was yesterday.
We can't keep living in the past.
Besides, Louise just arrived.
Oh, but Larry, if their plans are all set Louise, just stay out of this.
You don't get an invitation to a castle every day in the week, you know.
But we're all packed and ready to go.
Just hear me out, then you can tell me what you think.
We'll spend a nice, quiet, restful weekend with the Duke, then on Monday, you and I can meet with Regal Silverware.
But we won't be here Monday.
Of course you will, if you spend a weekend at the castle.
Do you get the logic?
No, but I get the idea.
Apparently, we're going to spend the weekend at the castle.
We conclude our tour of Whitset Castle with a look at some of our ancestral portraits.
Not too well lit down here, you'll notice.
And that's no accident.
Like any other family, we have our black sheep.
This is Harry, the Eighth Duke of Whitset.
Quite a ladies' man, Harry.
He was killed in mortal combat by a jealous husband.
Aha.
Heh.
The lady in question was the Duchess of Windermere, whose portrait you saw in the library.
Oh, the pretty one.
It's my theory that Harry's our ghost.
There's a ghost here?
One of the most active in the land.
Excuse me, Your Grace.
But Cook would like to speak to you, if she may.
I'll be there directly.
Can't keep Cook waiting, you know.
She's the real lord of the manor.
Excuse me.
Certainly.
Do you really think there's a ghost here?
Well, uh, l-let me put it this way.
I h I have a feeling there is.
What's that?
The ghost, probably.
Don't be ridiculous.
Larry.
Larry.
Do you think that's gonna go on all night?
I certainly hope not.
Well, I'm not very sleepy.
I think I'll go to the library and try and find something to read.
Okay.
Excuse me?
Boo!
Aah!
Uh, would you mind holding it down a bit?
You're disturbing everybody's sleep.
That's what I'm supposed to do, and you are supposed to be frightened.
I usually terrify the average mortal.
Well, I'm not your average mortal.
I'm a witch.
A witch?
Ha-ha.
You've got to be joking.
Uh, a lot of people think there's no such thing as a ghost.
Yes, but they're quite wrong.
So are you.
Turn around.
Now watch this.
You frightened me half to death.
How could I when you're already?
Yes, you're quite right.
So you are a witch.
And a very cute little witch, I might add.
Oh, ha-ha.
Thank you.
Maybe you and I could have a little fun?
Forget it.
Oh.
I've been haunting for such a long time, ducky.
It's awfully lonely always to be heard and never seen, always to see and never to touch.
Sorry.
Your trouble is that you're just a little transparent.
So are your motives.
Well, now, ducky.
We ghosts have our ways, you know.
I'm sure you do.
So why don't you go out and drum up a nice lady ghost, and let everybody get some sleep?
I've got a much better idea than that, ducky.
How about a little good night kiss?
Ugh!
Blah!
Is that any way to treat a dear, beloved husband?
Yes, especially when you're not my dear, beloved husband.
Now, what is that supposed to mean?
It means you're wasting your time.
I can still see through you.
Couldn't fool you, could I, ducky?
I will give you to the count of three to get out of my husband's body.
Or what?
Or I'll zap you out of existence.
Oh, now remember this, ducky.
As long as I'm in your husband's body, whatever you do to me, you do to him.
And now pucker up and give us another little kiss, ducky.
No!
You stay away from me or I'll scream.
Oh?
Uh, like this?
Well, that's certainly a ghost with a lot of spirit.
Louise, you're not at your best when you try humor.
It's no use, ducky.
No matter what you do, you can't get away from me.
That's what you think.
Ducky?
Ducky?
Ducky?
Ducky, now where did you go?
Ducky?
Ducky?
What's going on?
Uh, I'm looking for my wife.
Is something wrong?
Oh, there you are.
Samantha, is everything all right?
Oh, sure.
Darrin and I just had a little misunderstanding, but it's all right now.
I knew you couldn't stay mad at me.
Uh, sorry if we disturbed you.
Uh, good night.
Will you do me a favor and get lost?
Never.
Don't you get the picture?
Or does a castle have to fall on you?
Because I can arrange that, you know.
Go ahead.
You can't do me any harm.
I'm already a ghost.
What does he mean he's already a ghost?
Well, I guess he means if Samantha doesn't love him, he might as well be a ghost.
I wish I knew what the problem was.
The problem is they're married.
Oh.
What's the use?
Let me in.
Not until you decide to behave like a human being if you know what I mean.
It's none of our business.
Oh!
Go away.
Samantha, it's me.
Can I help?
No, everything's fine.
See?
Let's go back to bed.
Are you sure?
Can't you see?
Everything is fine.
Do you mind?
Samantha, there are times when it's foolish to try to keep up appearances, especially with old friends.
You're going to spend the night with me.
Yes, but what about And you can spend the night with this This heel.
I'm not a heel.
I'm a Thank you, Louise.
And when you decide to be yourself, just let me know.
What'd you do to get her so upset?
I just asked her for a little kiss.
Look, Darrin, if you don't wanna talk about it, just say so.
You know, that stupid ghost sounds like it's right here in this room.
That ghost is not stupid.
Okay, if you say so.
Sounds like that ghost is never going to give up.
Please, don't say that.
Well, I didn't sleep too badly after the ghost settled down, but you kept tossing.
I was worried about where the ghost had settled.
What?
Maybe I better go check on Darrin.
Samantha, that is exactly the wrong thing to do.
Make him come to you.
Here they come now.
Remember, play it cool.
And you make him apologize, you hear?
Morning.
Louise.
Morning.
Morning, Larry.
Morning, Sam.
Good morning Darrin.
Good morning ducky.
I'm not speaking to you.
Now, wait a minute, Samantha.
Darrin's very upset about what happened last night.
He wants to kiss and make up.
Don't you?
I sure do.
Well, I don't.
Samantha, Darrin is apologizing.
Darrin is not apologizing.
The acoustics in here are very peculiar.
I could have sworn I heard him apologize.
There's only one way he can make up with me.
And he knows what it is.
I'm sorry, but I'm not ready to give up the ghost.
What are you two talking about?
Oh, Larry, stop prying.
I'm sorry.
I forgot.
You're in charge of that.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, Duke.
We should be serving the hunt breakfast at 11:00 promptly.
Well, I trust that you heard the ghost last night?
We certainly did.
I'm delighted the ghost was in such good form.
Terribly temperamental, you know.
Ha-ha.
Sometimes, we don't hear from the old boy for days.
Did it ever occur to you that the old boy might be tired?
Tired?
Tired?
A ghost?
Oh, that's very good.
I don't think a ghost ever gets tired, my dear fellow.
Now how would you know?
Well, I suppose you're entitled to your own opinion.
Excuse me, Your Grace, but Cook isn't at all happy with the marketing you did.
Holy terror, that woman, you know.
Excuse me.
What's the matter with you?
Why'd you get so uptight about such a dumb thing as a ghost?
Because that's the way I felt.
And for your information, a ghost is not a dumb thing.
Why do you sound funny?
Funny?
Yeah, where'd you pick up that fake English accent?
This is not a fake accent.
Darrin, calm down.
And I'm tired of you telling me what to do.
Uh, maybe I better go after him.
Sit still, Samantha.
The worst thing you could do is chase after him.
Now, you let me talk to him.
Now wait a minute, Louise.
I don't think No, Samantha, let her handle it.
Well, he's in a very ugly mood.
Well, when it comes to handling ugly moods, Louise is a specialist.
She's been handling mine for years.
Darrin, may I talk to you?
Why not?
Sit down, ducky.
You not only don't act like yourself, you don't sound like yourself.
Sorry about that.
I got carried away with the atmosphere.
What on Earth has gotten into you?
Nothing.
On Earth, that is.
Well, I feel awful.
Samantha's not only my best friend, but, well, she's one of the sweetest women I've ever known.
You're pretty sweet yourself.
Oh.
Darrin, I'm serious.
What makes you think I'm not?
I just hope he doesn't say anything to offend her.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Louise has a pretty tough hide.
Uh-huh.
Well?
Samantha, you're right.
He's not himself.
Why?
What did he do?
Well, I was having a talk with him, trying to make him realize how unfair he was being to you.
And then, all of a sudden Yeah?
I can't even talk about it.
Louise, you'd better tell us, because if you don't, we'll start imagining something ridiculous, like he was making a pass at you.
And why is that so ridiculous?
Well, because you're old enough to be Darrin's Don't say it.
Why not?
Sister.
Well, uh, Louise, I'm sure you misunderstood, but, uh, I think maybe I better go and talk to him anyway.
What did he actually say?
Well He asked me to go to the gardener's cottage with him.
What for?
What do you think?
Oh.
It's obvious he's having a nervous breakdown.
You can joke about it, but I've never been so insulted in my life.
Now, what do you intend to do about it?
Well, what do you expect me to do?
Punch him in the nose?
Yes.
Come on.
You might as well get out of Darrin's body right now.
You're going to have to do it when we leave tomorrow anyway.
I may, and I may not.
I see.
Well, there's just one way to get you off my back.
What's that?
What you need is a real, live lady ghost, if you'll excuse the expression.
You don't really deserve this, but, uh Lady Windermere, right?
Right.
Who are you?
And you?
It's me.
Harry, you old devil.
Thank you for the promotion.
What a pleasure it is to see you, ducky.
But darling, why are you wearing all those silly chains?
Oh, well, they have to do with my haunting.
Well, you won't be needing them anymore.
Right, ducky.
What's going on?
Were you aware that the Duchess and I are old friends?
Uh I knew it was her husband who made a ghost out of you.
Sam, who are these people, and how come I can see through them?
What a pleasure it's going to be to have some company, especially on those cold winter nights.
Come, ducky.
Sam, what is it?
W-What's this all about?
It's a long story.
And, uh, we haven't time for long stories.
Well?
Go on.
Darrin, this isn't something I want to do, but, uh, I'm afraid I can't avoid it.
Uh, what?
In order to keep peace in the family, I'm going to have to rap you in the mouth.
The hunt breakfast is now being served.
But, uh, it can wait until after we eat.
Shall we go in?
You're a very graceful Duchess.
DUCHESS : Oh, Harry!
Oh.
By Jove!
I think we've got two ghosts now.
Well, I'm starving.
How about you?
Shall we go in to breakfast?
Louise?
Darrin, you really are a heel.
What?
Larry, are you just gonna stand there?
No.
Darrin, we might as well have this out right here and now.
What did I do?
Oh, dear.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, do you mind?
We'll be in in a minute.
Well, what happened was, when I came into this library last night, I met that ghost and he was such a pest.
Well, now, just go along with anything I say because I have a plan.
We have to make Louise happy because she thinks that you tried to make a pass at her in the garden, and you know how  Come along, everybody.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, Your Grace.
I'm afraid the soufflÃ©'s fallen.
Fallen?
Dear, dear.
You see, the kitchen is in another building, and I'm afraid that the soufflÃ© took a chill as it was being carried across the drawbridge.
I'll see if Cook has prepared a substitute one.
In the meantime, please carry on with the kidney pie.
Thank you.
Come along.
Well, what was all that about?
The soufflÃ© fell, and you're next.
When we get home, I'm gonna dig up a good psychiatrist for you.
Well, it looks as if Larry got the message.
What message?
Uh, these past few weeks were supposed to be a vacation with a little work on the side.
Well, you turned it into a little vacation with a lot of work on the side.
And poor Darrin, he's been under a terrible strain.
You may not believe this, but he's near the breaking point.
Oh, I believe it.
I believe it.
After his behavior, so do I. Oh, no.
Uh, you don't understand.
Uh, Darrin just wanted to show Larry what would happen if he didn't take some of the pressure off.
Well, it worked.
I told you he was cracking up, didn't I?
Do you understand, Louise?
Oh, perfectly.
What you're all saying is that unless somebody's out of his mind he couldn't possibly be interested in me.
Oh, no.
No, you don't understand.
You see, Darrin thought that if he paid attention to you Larry would realize that a nervous breakdown would be the only thing that would cause him to jeopardize our friendship, let alone their business relationship, because that's how we all got together in the first place, which should prove to you that Darrin would never dream of saying anything to offend you, right, sweetheart?
Right.
What did you say?
It doesn't matter what she said.
It was a compliment.
It was?
Eat your kidneys.
I'll explain it to you later.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Wow-wee, kids, wasn't that a funny cartoon?
I bet you never thought it was going to end, did you?
Neither did I. Okay, time for lunch.
Now, you have a choice.
What will it be?
Peanut butter and jelly or egg salad sandwiches?
Shh, Mommy, we're watching Steamboat Bill.
Well, I'm sure that Steamboat Bill approves of lunch.
Now, what'll it be?
Mommy, please, you said we could watch Daddy's new show.
Well, sweetheart, it isn't really Daddy's show.
He just does the advertising.
Okay, kids, it's time for our daily boxing lesson.
You guessed it, Punch and Judy.
Sock it to her, Punch.
Hi, everybody.
My name is Mr. Punch, and this is the Punch and Judy Show.
First, I'll start things out by calling up my wife, Judy.
Hey, Judy, come on up.
JUDY : I can't.
Why not?
Because I'm busy, busy, busy.
You better come up or you're gonna be sorry, sorry, sorry.
Well, what do you want?
I want a kiss.
No.
All right, then try one of mine.
Ow.
Did you like it?
No.
Try another.
You'll acquire a taste for them.
Mommy, how come Punch always hits Judy?
Because she isn't a member of women's lib.
What, Mommy?
Never mind, sweetheart.
Punch is just very aggressive, which doesn't seem to bother your brother one bit.
Now, what'll you have for lunch?
How about a TV lunch?
Okay, two TV peanut-butter- and-jelly specials coming up.
No.
Boy, you're persistent, aren't you?
You're also a glutton for punishment.
Take another and another and another.
Now Larry.
How's our latest contribution to the humor and culture of our youth?
Not only have I not laughed, chuckled or smiled, but I'm actually in pain.
Let me remind you, you're not a 5-year-old.
But you are the account executive, so keep watching.
The sponsor might ask questions.
I'm gonna have a sore head tomorrow, I can tell that.
Ow!
That's awful, the way he keeps hitting her.
You better look out.
Oh, yeah?
Well, take another and another and another.
You're learning real bad things from this show.
Okay, someone has to put a stop to all this hitting, and it might as well be me.
Judy, go get my supper.
No.
And another.
Hi.
My mommy says you're very aggressive and because of you, my brother keeps on hitting me.
Tabitha.
That girl.
Where did that kid come from?
I don't know.
I never saw her before.
Wha?
Ow, ow, ow!
Stop that hitting.
Yeah, where did the kid come from?
How do I know?
Maybe they added something without telling us.
Or maybe the director's back on the funny water.
All you know how to do, Punch, is hit.
There's Wait till I tell my analyst about this.
Oh, come on, little girl.
Don't be a spoiled sport.
I ain't hitting her hard.
Besides, Judy likes it.
Sam!
I sure do.
Ow, ow, ow!
Adam, Judy only said that because she's scared of Punch.
But, Judy, you don't have to be scared of Punch anymore.
What?
Where's my slapper?
Judy, have you seen my slapper?
No, but I'll go get another one.
My goodness.
Thank you very much.
There.
Now, doesn't that feel better?
No.
Hello?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Sam, may I ask what you're doing?
Of course you may.
May I ask why you ask?
Because your daughter is on television.
What?
She just popped into the Steamboat Bill Show.
You're kidding.
Sam, there are certain things I don't kid about.
Do something.
All right, all right.
Oh, Tabitha.
Nah-nah, you missed me.
Didn't that time.
Punch, you're setting a bad example for all the little boys watching.
My little brother hit me because of you.
Tabitha.
Oh, hi, Mommy.
I'm on TV.
No, you're not.
You're canceled.
Now, you come home right this minute.
I'm sorry, but my mother wants me.
Punch, don't you forget what I said.
You all saw that, didn't you?
I mean, it's not just me.
Tabitha, you were very naughty, and I am very angry.
But, Mommy, I didn't hurt anybody.
Well, I'm not too sure.
You might have hurt Daddy.
But, Mommy, how come you do stuff sometimes?
Only in emergencies.
To correct something that Esmeralda or Uncle Arthur might have done.
Some small catastrophe.
What's a catastrophe?
Something we live with in this house every day.
Oh, uh, hi, Larry.
Don't you "Hi, Larry" me, you sly devil.
Yeah, well, look, it's really very easy, very simple to explain.
Silverton loved it.
Who?
Silverton, the sponsor.
Remember him?
He loved it.
Oh.
He just called to say he thought it was a marvelous touch having the girl talk to the puppets as if they were real people.
And I agree with him Even though I didn't see it.
Now, as your commander in chief, I demand to know why you didn't let me in on it.
Well, because it was, uh, only just an experiment.
Experiment, my eye.
Silverton wants to use her every day.
The calls to the station have been fantastic.
That little kid really got to the audience.
Well, that's wonderful, Larry.
The only trouble is, uh, we're not gonna be able to get to that little kid.
What do you mean?
Well, you see, I just had an usher, uh Uh, pick her out of the audience.
I haven't the slightest idea who she is.
And after the show she just popped out like she popped in.
Popped out, popped in?
Uh, well, that's just a figure of speech.
We'll just have to find another kid.
Oh, yeah.
And we will, we will.
That's a great idea, Larry.
No wonder you're my commander in chief.
Sam, how could you?
How could you let Tabitha do a thing like that?
Sweetheart, you're not listening.
I didn't let her.
She just popped in by herself.
I can't watch her every second.
Sam, this is serious.
Tabitha can't keep on abusing her powers of witchcraft like this.
I I know, sweetheart.
I had a serious witch-to-witch talk with her.
And she realizes the full impact of what she did and promises never to go TV-popping again.
But if she's this undisciplined as a child, imagine what she'll be like when she grows up.
Darrin.
I don't think your right hand knows what your left hand is doing.
Either one of those drinks is mine, or you're going to be the fastest drunk in the West.
Sorry, Sam.
I'll get it.
Hello, Darrin.
Larry, what a surprise.
Uh, come on in.
You remember Lester Silverton, president of the Silverton Toy Company?
Of course.
How are you, Mr. Silverton?
The string, Darrin.
Pull the string.
Oh, of course.
Forgive me, I forgot.
Hello, Mr. Stephens, nice to see you again.
Likewise.
Well what can I do for you?
You can mix us two Scotch and sodas in the living room.
Oh, yes.
Darrin, you're going to flip when you hear the great idea Mr. Silverton's come up with.
Well, hi, everybody.
Hi, Samantha.
Mr. Silverton, this is Samantha, Darrin's charming and lovely wife.
Oh, Larry.
It's a pleasure.
Pull the string, Sam.
Of course.
I like you.
I'd like to be your friend.
How cute.
Well, two Scotches coming right up.
Uh, sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Mr. Silverton.
Well, what's the great idea, Mr. Silverton?
Well, it's an ingenious way to find our little mystery girl.
Mystery girl?
Our TV mystery girl, who else?
I thought we were going to get a replacement.
I've set up interviews for tomorrow for a new girl.
Don't be ridiculous.
That kid charmed this town.
She's a fantastic find and we're going to find her.
I hope so.
Now, what we do is run a campaign.
Who is this mystery girl who has captured the hearts of people in television land?
Is she the little girl next door?
Is she your little girl?
The publicity would be tremendous.
Of course, the person identifying the mystery girl would receive a substantial cash prize.
How much?
Sam.
Well.
Mommy, Daddy.
I want to say good night.
No.
That's okay, sweetheart, you said good night to us last night.
Hold it.
Hold it.
That's her.
That's who?
The mystery girl on the show.
Tabitha?
Impossible.
Uh, but, Larry, if, uh If Mr. Silverton thinks that Tabitha looks like the mystery girl, at least you have a clue to go on.
She not only looks like the kid, she is the kid.
Oh, I'm afraid, Mr. Silverton, that, uh, you're mistaken.
Stephens, not only do I never make mistakes, but when I do, nobody points them out to me.
I hope I make myself clear.
Perfectly.
Right, Darrin?
Well, I guess that's the shortest contest in history.
Go to bed, Tabitha.
I'll come up and tuck you  Now, just a minute.
I'd like to ask the little girl a question.
How would you like to be the star of my TV show?
I'd love it.
Can I, Mommy?
Can I, Daddy?
Can I be a star?
We'll talk about that later.
Now you go on up to bed.
Night, Tabitha.
Stephens, how come the big secret?
Yes, we'd like an explanation, and it better be a good one.
Hopefully, a great one.
Well, uh, will you buy the fact that, uh, I got the idea to use a little girl on the show at the last minute, so it was too late to hire an actress s So I used Tabitha?
Well, that certainly sounds reasonable.
Just one thing, Tate.
You know I'm against hiring relatives.
Well, I'm dead set against nepotism, myself.
Why, even my own daughter who happens to be a very fine little actress never has worked on my TV show.
I guess that settles it.
Right.
Darrin, I'll join you tomorrow at the interviews for Tabitha's replacement.
I don't think that'll be necessary, Tate.
You don't?
No, Tabitha stays on the show.
B But what about your attitude toward nepotism?
Stephens, I think you'll find my attitude toward nepotism is not as strong as my attitude toward profit.
The audience reaction to your daughter spells profit.
Replacing her might spell loss.
Right.
Darrin, I want Tabitha on that set first thing tomorrow morning.
Do I make myself understood?
Perfectly.
Ha-ha!
Well, I guess there's no business like show business, is there?
Cheers.
You haven't touched your eggs.
My stomach can't get used to the idea that Larry talked us into letting Tabitha appear on that TV show.
Well, don't you worry, sweetheart.
I guarantee you that Tabitha's star will be eclipsed the day she starts, which is today.
Um, question: How?
Well, uh, witchcraft got you into this mess so witchcraft can get you out of it.
Uh, question.
How?
Answer.
I'm waiting, Sam.
Darrin, why don't you go to the office, and I'll phone the answer in?
Question.
When?
Just as soon as I think of it.
Witchcraft's done the dirty deed.
Reverse it now with all due speed.
Gossamer wings The words pell-mell.
Whisk me to where The Silvertons dwell  Time for another cup of coffee, dear?
Sorry, dear, but I've got to get to the studio early.
The Stephens girl is starting today.
I want to see that everything goes smoothly.
Is she any good?
Good?
Helen, she was great.
She was so natural and innocent with those puppets, she gave you the feeling that she was actually talking to real people.
But Robin has a natural and innocent quality too, Lester.
I think you ought to reconsider and Not a chance, Helen.
Robin's a fine little actress, but you know how I feel about hiring relatives.
It looks bad.
Well, I gotta get a move on.
Have a good time at the museum.
So long.
Goodbye, Lest.
Have a good time today, honey.
Bye.
Bye-bye, Daddy.
Mommy, after the museum, can we go to the movies?
Of course, dear.
We'll do anything you want to.
We'll go to the museum, to the movies, to the zoo.
But if we're gonna do everything, we're gonna have to get started.
I don't like to be late getting to the I don't like to be late getting to the studio.
The studio?
We're not going to the studio, we're going to the museum.
No, dear, we're going to the studio.
Why?
Why?
Oh, Robin, don't ask such silly questions.
Why?
I I don't know why.
But we're going.
All right, troops.
All right, hold it.
Run through in 30 seconds.
Watch that.
Lights, lights, lights.
Attaboy.
Good.
Let's get this puppet show on the road.
Where's Bill?
Steamboat Bill, where?
Here I am.
Always when I don't need you.
I wanna go through the opening.
I want you high, baby, high.
Not down.
Watch it.
Now, when Punch hits Judy for the third time, you say, "Punch" Why do I have to wait for the third time?
He could have hurt her by then.
Don't worry, puppets are built to take a lot of punishment.
Now, pay attention.
You say All right, you got it?
I got it.
I've been doing this for 10 years.
Too long.
Okay, everybody, get with it.
Places, please.
Oh, where's my star?
Where's my little star?
Right here.
Here I am.
Now, during this picnic scene, Punch hits Judy.
Then I want you to say, "Punch, I think deep down, you don't like little girls".
Now, have you got that?
Look, no combing, no time.
Right over here.
Up on Camera 2.
And action.
He took my chicken leg.
He took my chicken leg.
Punch, deep down, I think you don't like girls.
Oh, I do, I do.
But I like chicken legs more.
Ow!
You're getting into very bad habits.
When you're older, you'll realize that girls have feelings too.
Can't he realize that now?
How many more years of abuse must I take?
Pick a number from one to 10.
Ow!
That settles it.
Judy, I'm gonna find you another boyfriend.
You are?
Would you, Tabitha?
Would you?
One that doesn't hit quite so hard?
You know, Judy, not all boys hit girls.
They don't?
They don't?
Ha!
They don't know all the fun they missed.
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
Okay, okay.
Cut.
That was very good.
Let's take a break.
Tabitha, dear, I'll be right out.
All right, Tabitha, let's try on this other dress.
Mommy, when do I get time to play a little bit?
Not for a while, sweetheart.
Being a star requires a lot of work.
But the director said I could take a break.
Well, taking a break doesn't mean you can play.
It just means getting ready for the next scene.
Okay, Tabitha, I have some line changes for you.
Here on page 24.
Now, this is where we do the history lesson.
Let me touch up her makeup.
Let me smooth out her hair.
Look, would you leave my little star alone?
If I don't fit this dress, it won't be ready for airtime.
Don't smudge her makeup.
Watch her hair.
Would you all be quiet while I go through these lines?
Now, Tabitha, pay attention, darling.
What we're going to do is tell the What are you?
Tell the story of G George Washington.
George Washington was a great American statesman, and he stood on the banks of the Potomac River Okay, Tabitha, darling.
That should do it.
Okay, crew.
On stage in 10 seconds.
Oh, go see if Punch and Judy need anything.
Mommy, I don't think I like being a star.
Well, you'll get used to it.
You mean I'm going to have to do this forever?
No.
Not if you don't want to.
Would you rather go to the zoo this afternoon?
I sure would.
Well, you're in luck.
I have an idea.
Now, listen, Tabitha, all you have to do is forget the name of the president that threw whatever it was over All right, now, Tabitha, we're going to do the scene where you give Punch and Judy a history lesson.
Hi.
Let's try it, huh?
Tabitha, start with George Washington and the silver dollar, right?
Up on Camera 2.
Attaboy.
Action.
The story goes that George Washington threw a Uh, threw a I just told you, Tabitha, a silver dollar.
Oh, yeah.
I forgot.
Sorry, Punch.
Sorry, Judy.
The story goes that George Washington threw a silver dollar across the river.
Now, look, that's the Potomac River.
Now, what is the matter with you, Tabitha?
I'm sorry, Mr. Director, but I can't remember my lines.
Don't worry.
Just keep going.
You'll remember.
But I'm tired.
Tabitha, my dear, you are a star, and the show must go on.
Now, let's take it from the top.
I'm tired.
I wanna go home.
Me too.
But she can't go home.
Right.
She has a job to do.
Yes.
What kind of a pro is she?
Well, she's not a pro.
She's a little girl.
If you wanted a pro, you should hire an actress.
I have an idea.
What about Robin?
Well, Robin is my daughter and you know how I feel about hiring relatives.
Mr. Silverton, may I remind you that Tabitha is my daughter And when I need to be reminded of something, I'll ask you.
Anyway, Robin isn't here.
All right, troops, take a five while we straighten this out.
Get your cameras.
Robin.
Helen.
What are you doing here?
Well, I I really don't know.
Well, Robin, as long as you're here, I'd like to ask you a question.
Yes, Daddy.
How would you like to be on Daddy's show?
But you said I could never be on any of your shows.
I just asked you a question.
Yes or no?
I'd love it, Dad.
All right, sweetheart.
Let's go onstage and we'll get you ready.
Maybe someday you'd like to explain this to me.
Uh, Larry, uh, you'd never believe it.
Try me.
Well, first let's tell the director he's got a new little star.
Mrs. Silverton.
Mrs. Silverton.
Hi.
I'm Samantha Stephens.
How do you do?
I'm Helen Silverton.
Yes, it's nice to meet you.
I'm so glad Robin got the job.
I'm sure she'll be just great.
Oh, aren't you going to stay and watch the show?
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm gonna spend the rest of the day with Tabitha.
I think I'll take her to the zoo.
And then maybe we'll go to the museum.
And after the museum, maybe we'll go to the movies.
Sam?
Hm?
Do you know what makes being married to a witch so wonderful?
What?
Well, for example, take a day like this.
It's like getting hit over the head with a hammer.
If feels so good when it stops.
I am going to pretend you meant that as a compliment.
Mommy, Daddy, is it all right if I say good night tonight?
Of course, sweetheart.
Good night and sweet dreams.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, dear.
Daddy, was Robin good on the show today?
She was pretty good.
She got Punch to stop hitting Judy so much.
I bet you if I were on the show, I could get Punch never to hit Judy again.
There's too much hitting on TV.
Sweetheart, you're just going to have to let Robin handle the campaign on nonviolence.
But there's a little hitting that you can take care of yourself.
What's that, Mommy?
I want you to hit the sack.
Immediately.
Speaking of nonviolence, where were we?
Oh, yes.
Just about here.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Flowers, rise.
I said, "Flowers, rise".
Flowers, won't you please rise?
Is this some sort of a charade?
Oh, Mother, am I glad to see you.
No, it isn't a charade and you are looking at one sick witch.
What's happened?
I've lost my powers.
Great Halley's comet!
I'll call Dr. Bombay right away.
Oh, don't bother.
He's been here and gone.
Well, how could you get in touch with him without your witchcraft?
Well, Esmeralda was babysitting for me and she contacted him.
What did Bombay say was wrong?
Nothing.
Samantha.
Well.
Mother, it's very difficult to talk about.
Uh, Dr. Bombay gave me a complete checkup with his computerized hexometer and couldn't find a single, solitary thing wrong with me.
Then how does he explain the loss of your powers?
Well, Dr. Bombay seems to think that He seems to think that it's a manifestation of molecular mortal linkage caused by a formation of polymers and certain hydrogen elements in a biological unity of two or more dominant species.
Would you like me to repeat that?
No, I got it.
Mother, promise you'll try to control yourself.
Yes.
Yes, I will.
It's the result of your mortal marriage.
You got it, all right.
Mother.
Mother, you promised to control yourself.
I did.
If I didn't, this house would be in El Paso.
Have you told Durwood?
He merely pointed out that millions of-of people get along very well without witchcraft.
And, well, maybe he's right.
Maybe I can adjust.
Maybe you could.
And I might even learn to live with the disgrace.
But your father is another story.
When he finds out, I wouldn't give two kopeks for Durwood's continued existence.
Oh.
And he's bound to find out sooner or later.
Correction.
He's going to find out sooner.
Mother.
Yes?
Wouldn't we stand a better chance of avoiding an explosion if Daddy didn't find out I'd lost my powers?
What are you suggesting?
Well, there's nothing wrong with your powers.
Oh, I see what you mean.
Mm-hm.
Maurice, what are you doing in that absurd costume?
I'll give you a hint.
O that this too too solid flesh would melt.
Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew.
Going on a diet?
No, he's a Danish prince.
Or a Danish ham.
Endora, you have all the charm of a tsetse fly.
All right, Yorick, that will be all for now.
You may go.
Alas, poor Yorick.
He isn't well.
Samantha, my dearest.
Mm.
Endora, for you.
I know how you love to make cutting remarks.
Oh, you're so sharp.
Well, Daddy, I suppose with your crowded schedule you're on your way somewhere.
No, on the contrary.
I've decided to drop out of the witches' race for a while and spend a few days with you and the children.
Oh, how nice.
By the by, how is Adam progressing with his witchcraft?
Fine.
And Tabitha?
She's doing fine too.
Has she flown yet?
Not yet.
Huh.
It's obvious her powers of witchcraft are frustrated with this mortal atmosphere.
As I recall, you were barely Oh, well.
Which reminds me, do you remember that charming little trick you used to do when you were a child?
Turning yourself into a polka-dotted unicorn?
Remember, Endora?
Who can forget?
She used to butt me with her horn.
I'd dearly love to see you do that again, Samantha.
Well, I, uh  Okay.
Hm, doesn't look quite the same.
What's the difference?
A unicorn is a unicorn.
What is going on?
Darby.
Are you still living here?
If you call this living.
What is this, who did it, and how about getting rid of it?
Don't be a dolt, this is Samantha.
It's a little trick she used to do when she was a child.
You mean, she got her witchcraft back?
Back?
Blabbermouth.
What is this all about?
Durwood, like the rest of you, your timing is atrocious.
Samantha, is this true, that you've lost your powers?
W Well, yes, it is.
Sort of, in a way.
But not actually.
Samantha, why are you hedging?
Did I sound like I was hedging?
No, it's no use, Samantha.
You might as well tell him.
Yes, uh.
Darrin, why don't you go and wash up before dinner?
I'm not hungry.
Something has taken the edge off my appetite.
The lack of admiration is mutual.
Daddy, how about a martini?
Let's not avoid the issue, Samantha.
Samantha, I've learned from experience that circumventing the truth is not the way around your father.
Okay.
But, Daddy, you have to promise me that you'll think before you react.
Promise?
Oh Well, it's because of my marriage.
Ooh.
Ah.
When I met you, my first instinct was to turn you into a leaping lizard.
I'm sorry I didn't obey that instinct.
Daddy, you promised that you'd think before you reacted.
I have thought, and now I'm reacting.
Young man, you are a leaping lizard.
Oh.
Good heavens.
That's funny.
I don't feel like a lizard, leaping or otherwise.
Oh, Dr. Bombay.
Did you find something that could help me?
No, but I've isolated the bug you've got.
Bug?
The computer couldn't find anything wrong with me.
I'm afraid that computer has a few bugs of its own.
What you have is a rare disease called perimeridictamitis.
I'm working on the cure right now.
In the meantime, you must all avoid direct contact with her and above all, no one must kiss her.
This might cause a complete loss of his or her powers.
Make that "his".
Oh, Daddy, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry, my dear.
How long will it take you to find a cure for this perimeri?
P?
P?
Perimeridictamitis.
No way of telling.
Few hours, few weeks, couple of months, few years.
Lucky for you, I have a new assistant who's on a fellowship from Witches U. Lucky for me, she's not a fellow.
Well, well, well.
If I didn't have scruples, wouldn't I be in a lovely position to pay you back for all the nasty things you've done to me?
Fortunately, I don't have any scruples.
Darrin, be careful.
Young man, take my advice and take her advice.
When the mighty fall, the jackals come to call.
As poor old King Lear said in similar circumstances: Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks.
Rage.
Blow.
You cataracts and hurricanoes.
Oak-cleaving thunderbolts I think now would be a good time for me to go to wash up.
Come back.
I'm not through yet.
As far as I'm concerned, you are.
Darrin, watch it.
Before you find yourself in orbit around the planet of your choice.
Or you may turn into a leaping lizard after all.
Daddy, what were you saying?
I was saying: Oak-cleaving thunderbolts, singe my white head.
And thou all-shaking thunder.
Crack nature's moulds, that make ingrateful man.
Oh, Daddy, that is absolutely Rumble thy bellyful.
Sorry.
Spit, fire.
Spout, rain.
I said I was sorry.
Good morning, Mother.
Did you sleep well?
Sleep?
I was up all night.
Samantha, I'm worried sick about your father.
We must be very kind and considerate of him.
And above all, let's not let him know how concerned we are.
Right.
Sam, I'll have two three-minute eggs and Oh, good morning, Endora.
Make that one one-minute egg.
That way, I can leave the house sooner.
Durwood, I'm not in the mood to bandy words with you.
Where is poor Maurice?
He's coming down.
I had to show him how to use my razor.
Oh.
The thought of Daddy having to use a razor.
Oh, it's ill-making.
It's just ill-making.
That fine proud figure of a warlock, reduced to this.
Good morning, all.
Good morning.
I've had the most marvelous experience.
I shaved with a razor.
You know, it's remarkably efficient.
And it gives one's skin a bit of a tingle.
Mm.
Is that smoked pheasant I smell?
No.
It's just ham and eggs.
Ham and eggs?
That sounds a very intriguing combination.
Oh, Maurice, you don't have to pretend with us.
We're your family.
Why don't you let me zap up some pheasant for you?
Here, let me help you to the table.
Endora, have you gone completely batty?
Oh, I can't bear to watch this.
I just I just can't bear to watch this.
What ails the old girl?
She's a little overwrought about your losing your powers.
Ridiculous.
What your mother doesn't What your mother doesn't understand is that this temporary loss of powers presents a unique opportunity to me.
Opportunity?
Of course.
To find out how the other half lives.
Well, that's a very sensible attitude.
I'm glad you feel that way, because do you know what I've decided to do today?
Come with you to your office to take a look around.
Why?
I'm interested in knowing what you do for a living.
Well, I'd like to oblige, but I'm afraid I can't.
I beg your pardon.
No, I have to prepare for an important meeting.
You don't seem to understand, young man.
I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
You're the one who doesn't seem to understand.
Without your powers, you have no way of forcing me to agree.
Excuse me.
Uh-oh.
I'm sorry, but I just had to assert myself.
I know.
But asserting yourself in front of Daddy is not conducive to continued good health.
What can he do to me now?
Oh, my stars.
You were saying?
H How about coming down to the office with me, Maurice, and having a look around?
Oh, Betty, there you are.
I'd like you to meet my father-in-law, Mr Just Maurice.
How do you do?
Charmed, my dear.
What a lucky devil you are to have such an attractive amanuensis.
Oh, no, I'm just a secretary.
Yes, that's what I meant to say.
Hi, Darrin.
Oh, hi, Larry.
Uh, you know my father-in-law.
Oh, of course, of course.
How are you?
Going to a wedding?
No.
Oh.
M-Maurice just thought he'd come down to the office with me today and sort of, uh, look around.
Yes, and so far, what I've looked at is most pleasing.
Uh, Benson's due any minute and we still haven't gone over these layouts.
Think this color match is close enough?
Mm-hm.
"Benson's Chili Con Carne".
That's chili with meat.
Thanks for the translation.
Can I be of any other assistance?
Well, if you really wanna help, um, why don't you sit right here at my desk?
Uh, Betty will give you a pad and a pencil, and if you come up with any ideas for a slogan or a campaign for this chili, just, uh, write them down.
But I've never tasted it.
Well, you don't have to taste a product to sell it.
You don't?
That doesn't seem logical.
Logic has nothing to do with advertising.
Suppose we step into my office?
Right.
Uh, just ask Betty, and she'll get you coffee or anything.
Would you like some coffee?
No, thanks.
But, uh, what comes under the heading of "anything"?
When do you suppose that fool doctor is going to come up with a cure?
Soon, I hope.
Although Daddy's attitude is remarkably good.
Mm.
For him.
Dr. Bombay.
About time.
DR.
Hello?
Hello?
Ah.
There you are.
Do you have the cure?
Yes, I've found the antitoxin to perimeridictamitis and here is the prescription.
The apothecary will fill it for you.
I'll take care of it.
No, no.
You'll have to zap Samantha there.
The apothecary insists upon examining the patient before filling the prescription.
Why is that necessary?
Well, he claims that lately, a lot of witches have been given the wrong drugs through sloppy diagnosis.
You're the only one who treats witches.
Do you have to be so blunt about it?
Well, Bombay's done it again.
You mean, his diagnosis was wrong?
No, he's right, and it's the second time this year.
Well, that's a relief.
Now, how soon can I have the antitoxin?
Oh, that's tough to say.
I'm a slow worker.
Except with a groovy chick like you.
How's about a little kiss, cutie?
Oh, come on.
Now, stop fooling around.
Who's fooling around?
I'm serious.
It gets kind of lonely here, you know?
You know something?
Girls move a lot quicker than they used to.
All right, you like to make a little game of it, do you?
Okay.
Now Now Now, look, um Why don't you tend to business?
This is my business.
The shop is just a hobby.
Um.
You better give me that prescription before you have an attack.
Help me to that chair.
Oh, before I catch you, I've gotta catch my breath.
I've got you.
No.
Where are your ethics?
Oh, let's see, now.
I used to keep them up there on that shelf.
Now, look, once and for all, will you give me that antitoxin?
Only in exchange for a kiss.
Would you settle for a lukewarm handshake?
I want a kiss, a whole kiss, and nothing but a kiss.
Don't worry, honey, I'll get your prescription now.
I just wanted to refresh my memory.
Well, I think this one really stirs the appetite.
Uh, a cowboy cooking over an open flame in the fresh crisp air, and the copy, "Out of the saddle and into the chili".
Very effective, don't you think?
You really wanna know what I think?
I think I know what you think.
Ah.
There you are.
Oh.
We'll be through in a minute, Maurice.
Why don't you wait in the waiting room?
But what about my suggestions for the chili?
Hah.
Not now.
W-w-wait.
I'd like to hear those suggestions.
I'm getting desperate.
I take it you're Mr. Benson?
Yeah.
Sir, you are to be complimented.
Your chili is delicious.
Thank you.
That's already better than what I've heard.
The mistake you made, Durwood, was not tasting the chili.
He didn't even taste it?
Heh.
The poor guy doesn't even know his son-in-law's name, so I wouldn't  Excuse me.
Now what?
Sam's in the outer office.
You'd better get her in here.
She's the only one who can handle him.
Tell her to come right in.
Sam, come in, come in.
Hi, Larry.
Darrin.
Hi, Sam.
Hello, Daddy.
This is Mr. Benson, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, how do you do?
Delighted, I'm sure.
My daughter.
Oh.
How nice.
Well, it appears that this business meeting is turning into a family reunion.
Well, we are going to change it back into a business meeting.
Come along Daddy, I have your medicine.
Good, but first I want to give Mr. Benson my ideas on advertising his chili.
Well, why don't you take your medicine first?
I did, and I feel wonderful.
No, thank you, dear.
I think I'll go it on my own.
Mr. Benson, to be honest, I'd never tasted chili before.
I'd understood that chili con carne was a very ordinary food.
I found it to be a rare treat, a veritable gourmet dish.
Poor guy's lost his marbles.
He's got something you haven't got.
What's that?
Class.
If, indeed, it is thought of as ordinary, all the more reason for giving it aristocratic appeal.
Oh, that a man's reach should exceed his grasp.
Or what's a heaven for?
Robert Browning, right?
Precisely as I dictated it to him.
Now, here's the sort of thing I had in mind.
Picture a very distinguished man.
About your height?
More or less.
An attractive man of obvious breeding seated at a table set with fine china, linen, and candlelight.
A butler offers him a dish.
He holds up his hand and says, "Take away the caviar and bring me Benson's Chili Con Carne".
Oh, my, isn't that an interesting approach?
Naturally, she'd like it.
I like it too.
That makes three of us.
Four with Darrin, right?
Right.
Never underestimate the power of my father-in-law.
I think he's hit on a theme that just might catch on.
Might?
My dear sir, I know nothing about advertising, but I am an authority on human foibles.
One of the most sensitive of these is ego.
Strike a man there and you touch home, believe me.
I believe you, I believe you.
You're one of the most convincing people I've met.
Of course, you realize I did it with no spell whatsoever.
No what?
What does he mean, "no spell"?
Well, he's just pointing out that he He didn't have to use any tricks.
Right.
Well, Sam, I'm sorry you have to rush off.
Come along, Daddy.
Well, goodbye, all.
It's been charming.
And, Mrs. Stephens, you should be very proud of your father.
I think he's dynamite.
Oh, I do too.
And I never know when he might explode.
Daddy, you sure you won't stay for dinner?
No, thank you.
My dear, I want you to continue practicing your witchcraft in spite of what this buffoon tells you.
Now, just Stop, Darrin.
Don't say anything you might not live to regret.
Daddy, I appreciate the advice, but it's rather hard to ignore your husband's wishes.
It's not so hard, believe me.
Endora, I know that beneath that cold exterior there beats a heart of ice.
All this family warmth is underwhelming.
Darby, I'm warning you Uh, Darrin, I need some help in the kitchen.
Please.
Endora, I take my leave.
How about a real kiss for your old flame?
Well, if he shows up, I'll be glad to kiss him.
Come on, Endora, come on.
Stop pretending.
Well Sure, I'm grateful to your father.
I just wish he'd stop using me like a doormat.
Well, as long as he doesn't change you into one what difference does it make?
That man.
That man.
Do you know what he just did?
What?
He kissed me.
Oh, how sweet.
Sweet?
The wretch.
He hasn't taken the antidote, and now I have the bug.
Isn't that a shame?
Oh Darrin, this is no joking matter.
Yes, it is.
I saved half of this for you, my dear.
After you sip, how about a little sup?
I beg your pardon.
I was thinking of that little place we used to go to, on the Milky Way.
Daddy, what has gotten into you?
Oh, just some fond memories.
Um Ciao.
Oh, isn't that charming?
Just like anybody else's mommy and daddy.
You're kidding.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
"Deep in the forest, the woodcutter built a fire.
"'You stay here and rest, ' "the stepmother said to the children, "'and when we're ready, we'll come and fetch you.
' "So Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire and when lunchtime came, they had nothing to eat".
A Do you know what was going through.
Hansel and Gretel's mind?
Do you?
No.
Well, they were thinking, "Boy, some kids sure are lucky.
"Some kids have stew with potatoes "and milk and chocolate cake for dinner and leave half of it on their plates".
Now, where were we?
Let's see.
Oh, here we are.
"'What was that growling?
' asked Gretel, clutching Hansel in fright".
Honey, the Tates should be here any minute.
And I think your cheese puffs are burning.
Uh-oh.
Continued same time tomorrow.
What was that growling noise, Mommy?
Sweetheart, you're old enough to finish reading the story to Adam.
Come on, Adam.
"'What was that growling noise" asked Gretel".
A bear?
Lion?
Hansel's tummy.
It was growling from hunger.
See?
Aren't they sad?
I bet I could cheer them up.
Hi.
Don't be scared, it's only me.
Who are you?
Tabitha.
And this is my brother Adam.
We wanna cheer you up.
I'm Hansel and this is my sister Gretel.
Are you really hungry?
We haven't had anything to eat since last night's supper.
That's terrible.
I'm going to get you something to eat.
How did you do that?
Like this.
It only works for witches.
Witches are only in stories.
I'm a witch.
You couldn't be.
Witches are mean, ugly, old hags.
I'm a good witch.
And I'll prove it to you by getting you something to eat.
I made another batch of cheese puffs.
Mm, they smell good enough to eat.
I thought you might like some before Larry and Louise get here.
I'll be right with you.
I just wanna fix these flowers.
Hey, something smells good.
My mommy's cheese puffs.
Do you suppose we could have some?
That's what I promised.
Besides, Mommy always makes extras.
At the risk of hurting your feelings, I thought you were on a diet.
I am.
Why?
Do I look, uh?
I said have some, not the whole platter.
I had one cheese puff.
Darrin, either they disappeared into thin air or into your stomach.
Don't put any money on my stomach.
Put it on one of your whacked-out relatives.
Serena.
That's it.
She always did like my cheese puffs.
Serena.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Oh, Serena, stop horsing round.
Hm.
Well, maybe it was Mother.
Anyway, I'll fix some more.
I'm going to get the ice for the drink I'm going to need.
I guess you really are a witch.
These are the best cheese puffs we've ever tasted.
These are the only cheese puffs we've ever tasted.
Are you still hungry?
Yeah.
Do you like leg of lamb?
I don't know, but we'll take a chance.
Good, we're having leg of lamb for dinner.
I'll get you some.
Wouldn't your parents be mad?
No, they always taught Adam and me to share.
Would you like to stay over and have breakfast too?
Papa wouldn't let us.
I'll ask him.
But you don't know Papa.
He doesn't know me.
That's some trick.
It's easy when you know how.
Now, how do I find your father?
Just wander around.
If you don't find him, he'll find you.
Sweetheart, I wish you'd try to relax.
The leg of lamb is on its way.
So just take it Sam.
I'll be right back.
I'll follow the floating leg of lamb and find the culprit.
What are you two doing here?
We're about to have our breakfast, lunch and dinner.
I'm Hansel, she's Gretel.
And this is leg of lamb.
Who are you?
I happen to be the mother of a very naughty witch.
Incidentally, where is she?
She went into the book to ask Papa if we could sleep over.
Oh, my stars.
Sam, did you find out what happened to the?
I knew I was gonna need this.
Sam, what's going on?
Who are these kids?
And where is Tabitha?
Well  Uh, this is Hansel and-and this is Gretel.
And Tabitha went into the storybook to ask their papa if they could spend the night.
Which means I have to go into the book to find her.
This isn't the kind of story you should fool around in.
There's a mean witch in it.
Which really isn't as awful as it sounds.
It's all part of growing up.
Nothing to worry about, really.
This is Hansel and this is Gretel.
That's a book and Tabitha went into that book.
And you're telling me this is part of growing up and nothing to worry about?
Right.
Well, except the witch.
Oh, yeah, that witch is really mean.
She's always turning children into pies and eating them for dessert.
Bye.
I'll be right back.
Don't let Hansel and Gretel out of your sight.
Okay.
Tabitha.
Tabitha?
They'll never believe this down at the psychiatrist's.
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Nibble, nibble, like a mouse, who is nibbling at my house?
What you want, mister?
You better do something about those glasses.
I better do something about these glasses.
Look, whatever you are makes no never mind to me.
Nibbling on private property is against the law.
Ate away half my roof, you glutton.
Well, I'm sorry, but I was nervous.
Uh, I'm looking for my daughter.
Eh?
Daughter.
Won't find no water around here.
My well's gone dry.
I'm looking for a little girl called Tabitha.
What are you yelling about?
I don't know no Tabitha.
I know a Gretel and that's all I know.
Look, whoever you are, I'm a very wicked, old witch, and I'm getting sick and tired of you snooping around.
You don't belong here.
This is a restricted story.
Not that I'm prejudiced or anything but I have a fond respect for the classics, and you don't belong in this classic.
Now scat.
Scat.
Okay, you old bat.
I heard that.
Sorry.
Tabitha.
Tabitha.
Well, now, how do you expect to grow up to be a nice, plump Tabitha pie if you don't eat?
I don't wanna be a fat pie.
I wanna be a nice, skinny witch, like my mommy.
Well, you're a selfish little girl.
I was expecting Hansel and Gretel, but being as you've intruded, you'll do.
Heh-heh-heh.
If you don't let me out, I'll do some magic to you.
Try it.
All storybook witches are stronger than real little-girl witches.
I want my mommy.
Don't worry about your mommy, she won't be lonely.
She has a Hansel and a Gretel, instead of a stupid little Tabitha.
Adam, I wish your mommy would hurry back.
It isn't that I don't like children.
This just isn't my idea of a fun evening.
Uh-oh.
That must be Larry and Louise.
Now, you stay right here.
Oh.
Well, hi.
Hi, there.
Hope we're not early.
No, just fine.
Good.
Darrin, why are you carrying that leg of lamb?
Well, in the condition it's in, it couldn't very well walk by itself.
Where's Samantha?
She's upstairs doing, uh, something for Tabitha.
I've been covering for her in the kitchen.
Make yourselves comfortable, while I exchange this leg of lamb for some cheese puffs.
Mm.
Thank you.
Hello.
Hello.
Well, well, what have we here?
I'm Hansel and this is Gretel.
Hansel and Gretel, huh?
That's right.
How do you do?
Gretel?
We live in the forest with our father the woodcarver.
And we have nothing to eat and we're hungry.
Oh, you sound like you're right out of a fairy tale.
We are.
Tabitha got us out.
Actually, uh, Tabitha got them in.
Uh, these are friends of Tabitha's from down the street.
They're in a, uh A play that Sam is putting on for charity.
Oh, well, isn't that nice?
I'm surprised Samantha didn't mention it.
Well, it just came up.
Oh, well, they're certainly cute costumes.
Yes, yes.
Heh, heh.
Well, come on, kids, time to go home.
They're neighborhood kids, live right down the block.
Can't we have something to eat first?
There's nothing to eat at our house.
They're Method actors.
They're really into their parts.
Darrin, have you been drinking?
No.
Neither have we.
Oh, well, here.
What'll you have?
Uh, do you have any bouillon?
I'd love a bullshot.
I think I'll stick with Scotch and water.
Uh, Louise, wouldn't you rather have a Scotch and water?
It's closer.
Excuse me while I get the bouillon.
We'll go out and find something to eat.
It's nice meeting you.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Aren't they cute?
Where are the kids?
Oh, they went home.
What?
Well, why'd you let them?
Well, you just got through telling them to go home.
As a matter of fact, you were a little psyched-out on the subject.
But they Uh.
The costumes.
They took the costumes with them.
Well, I'm sure they'll bring them back.
How can they bring them back, if they get lost?
How can they get lost, when you told us they live just down the block?
But, it's a long block.
It could be pitch black by the time they get home.
Uh, I'll be right back.
Darrin.
Hm?
Oh, forgive me, Louise.
Uh, Larry, I'm sorry to impose but would you mind making the drinks?
Believe me, it's no imposition.
Hansel?
Gretel?
Hansel?
Gretel?
Uh, pardon me, sir.
Have you seen two little children about so high who answer to the name of Hansel and Gretel?
No, but Rumpelstiltskin was by a few minutes ago with a spinning wheel on his back.
That's funny.
Hansel?
Gretel?
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Pardon me, are you Hansel and Gretel's stepmother?
It depends.
Who are you?
Well, I'm here to To collect for the poor?
Oh, have you come to the wrong house.
We are the poor.
Is this the home of the woodcutter?
You call this a home?
Oh, the promises he made to me to talk me into this story.
"Brunhilda," he said, "I will become a famous woodcutter".
He became famous all right.
Famous for his poverty.
Believe me, madam, your life will have a happy ending.
How do you know?
Are you a fortune teller?
No, not really.
I'm a witch, and I'm looking for Wait a minute.
Where did you come from?
From there.
Oh, that miserable Wolfgang.
"Don't go into the forest, Brunhilda, "it's dangerous.
"There's a mean, old, ugly, wicked witch that lives there".
No.
No, you don't understand.
Oh, I understand, all right, why he keeps going into the forest every day to, quote, "look for some wood to cut," unquote.
What he's really looking for is, quote, "a little hanky-panky with the beautiful witch," unquote.
Will you please listen?
My name is Samantha.
I am a witch, but not in this story.
If you're talking to me, you're in this story.
No, no, you see, I I am looking for my daughter, Tabitha.
She's about this high and she has blonde I haven't seen her.
Maybe she got lost in the forest and the witch got her.
If there is a witch.
There is.
I was there.
She said she hadn't seen her either.
And you believed her?
Sure, I believed her.
Why did I believe her?
You're not supposed to believe fairy-tale witches.
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Do you really think you need another drink?
Louise, I've got to have some kind of nourishment.
Have a cheese puff.
I said, nourishment.
Are the kids back?
No.
How about Sam?
Well, she hasn't come down yet.
Do you think something's wrong?
Wrong?
What could be wrong?
I'll check.
Uh, have another drink.
Well, I think there's something radically wrong here.
Only if they run out of Scotch.
Nibble, nibble like a mouse, who is nibbling at my house?
Just knock it off and come out here.
Yes?
It's me again.
Go away.
I'm about to bake my supper.
And who would that be?
I don't give out recipes.
Now take off, before I do something  nasty.
You mean, like this?
Give me back my cane.
Oh, gladly.
This isn't a cane, it's a wand.
Of course.
And I am going to turn you into a fairy godmother.
For your information, you're not messing around with any storybook witch.
I happen to be the real thing.
I can't be a fairy godmother.
A fairy godmother is good and sweet.
Yuck.
And kind.
It'll ruin the story.
Yes, I know.
Oh, please, please.
You can't do this to millions of little children.
Okay.
Where's Tabitha?
What did you say your daughter's name was?
Tabitha.
Tabitha Stephens.
Oh, that Tabitha.
Oh, she's a lovely child.
I tell you what.
You turn me back and I'll take you right to her.
Thank you, thank you.
Come, come.
Mommy.
Hi, sweetheart.
I can't say I'm not glad to see you.
But when I get over my relief, I am going to be very angry.
How can you be angry at this poor, little darling?
Poor dear was wandering around in the woods lost, and Grandma put her in the guest room.
Well, we'll have her out in a minute, as soon as I find the key.
Let's go.
Good riddance.
All right, young lady, now you stay right here.
You have been a very naughty girl, and believe me, there's going to be some serious discussion later.
Okay, Mommy.
Thank you very much, officers, for bringing the kids home.
But we don't live here.
Well, where do you live?
We live in the forest.
These are real wiseacre kids.
You can never get a straight answer from them.
What's the trouble, officers?
Oh, don't worry, Larry, I'll handle it.
Why don't you fix another drink?
I just fixed myself another drink.
Well, then, fix me one.
All right.
Now, what's the problem, officer?
I'll tell you what's the problem.
What's the problem, officer?
I'll tell you what's the problem.
It's about time.
I'll explain.
What's the problem, officer?
I'll tell you If you'll let me finish the sentence, I'll tell you what's the problem.
The problem is these two kids were caught stealing ice cream from a street vendor.
Now, two popsicles we can overlook, but two gallons?
We were very hungry.
And we can't get their names out of them.
We told you.
I'm Hansel and she's Gretel.
And I told you, I'm Humpty and he's Dumpty.
And you know what they said when we asked their last names?
OFFICER 1: Said they didn't have one.
They were too poor to have one.
Look, officer, how much was the ice cream?
We'll make it good.
Oh, no, no, no, ma'am.
That won't teach them a lesson.
After all, we have to maintain law and order in the streets.
First it's ice cream, next it's banks.
Well, you say they're not your kids.
Now, where do they live?
We told you, in the forest.
Uh, they are very imaginative children.
Uh, actually, they live at 1432 Forest Lane Drive.
Fine.
We have to make a report on it.
We'll notify their parents.
Come on, kids.
It's okay, kids.
Uh, you'll be going home in just a second.
Tell Tabitha, thank you very much for the cheese puffs.
You're welcome.
All right, hurry up, we're wasting time here.
Charley?
Yeah?
Did you see what I saw?
What did you see?
Well, I'd rather not say.
If you'd rather not say, why should I pry?
Where'd they go?
They're upstairs.
I'll go up and see to it they get back in the book.
You cover with Larry and Louise.
Why don't you two have a little drink before?
I don't think Larry needs another drink.
Louise, I'm sorry.
Larry?
This is the first time in my life I've had a hangover before dinner.
Well, I'm very sorry, Larry, but, uh, I was having a little trouble with Tabitha.
Yes.
It's this play that Sam is directing for charity.
Tabitha was very jealous, because she wanted to play the part of Gretel instead of the part of the wicked, old witch and  Yes.
You know how it is with these temperamental actresses.
Well, those kids you got to play Hansel and Gretel are certainly convincing.
Yes.
Yes, they were, weren't they?
When's the play going to be, Samantha?
When?
Oh, I don't know.
Uh, sometime next month.
Oh, that's a shame.
They seem ready right now.
Oh, yes, they're ready, but we're not scheduled until later.
Oh, where is it going to be?
Where?
At the community center, but it isn't available until next month.
Say, I have an idea.
I belong to the Women's League, you know, and we have an auditorium that seats 300 people and it's available any time.
A-any time, huh?
Well, I don't know if I can get the sets and everything ready.
Oh, don't worry, I'll pitch in and help.
You just worry about the creative work.
You're very good at that, Sam.
How did you, uh, get started on this play?
It was Darrin's idea.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Just toast, honey.
Things are really piling up at the office.
We have a chance of closing on the Monticello Carpet account.
Why, Durwood, I didn't know you cared.
Mother.
Endora, would you kindly give us some warning when you're coming by?
Sending something ahead of you that's not so frightening.
Like a dragon.
Darrin.
I'll send a fire-breathing one, and we'll find out how inflammable you are.
Mother.
Endora, I am officially informing you that you are trespassing here.
Darrin!
I think I'm in a rut.
Have you told him?
Of course not.
Because I'm not going.
Uh, not going where?
My cousin Panda's getting married.
It would be a disgrace if Samantha missed the wedding.
They were very close as children.
Well, maybe we could make it.
When is it?
Next weekend.
In Hong Kong.
It's out of the question.
Endora.
Mother, that's not funny.
He treats you like a prisoner, you might as well look like one.
I am not a prisoner in this house.
Except when you show up.
The point is, Endora, I would want Sam to go to the wedding, but we just got back from Europe and work is piling up at the office, and I just cannot get away at this time.
I will send my apologies to Panda.
I'm sure she'll understand.
You actually mean you're going to let Durwood's silly job keep you from You bet your sweet broomstick.
Oh, how quaint.
Mother, would you mind springing me?
Of course not, dear.
Thanks a lot.
I'll see you at the wedding, my darling.
What did she mean by that?
I, uh I think I'd rather not think about it.
Powers of day, powers of flight.
Bring Alonzo here, into my sight!
Endora, baby, this is a pleasant surprise.
Alonzo, you look perfectly disreputable.
Well, thank you.
I'm just doing my thing.
Beautiful trip, but what am I doing here?
Have I ever told you about Samantha's mortal marriage?
Not more than a thousand times.
The fact is, Durwood's job is preventing Samantha from attending Panda's wedding.
Panda's getting married?
Who's the unlucky dude?
Never mind the critique.
Your job will be to un-job Durwood, so to speak.
It's people like you who give witches a bad rep.
Thank you.
I dig cutting up as much as the next cat, but I think I dig Samantha more, so find yourself another boy.
Perhaps Perhaps I could persuade you?
Never.
I happen to be heavy in integrity.
But I happen to know people in high places.
And one word from me and you could find yourself roasting like a marshmallow in an active volcano.
So much for my integrity.
All right, where do I find this Durwood?
If Cushman buys these concepts for his carpets, we have a good chance of landing all the other Monticello products.
The fabrics, the plastics, the wall paneling, everything.
Larry, do you know when you talk about money, your eyes light up?
Of course.
I'm a greedy person.
Mr. Tate Yes, Betty?
Excuse me for interrupting, but there's a man out in reception room, and I can't seem to get rid of him.
He's pretty weird.
Oh?
Well, relax, Betty.
Well?
Very well, and you?
What is the idea of bringing this bike into the office?
The idea is, I looked around out front.
I'm not sure this is a safe neighborhood.
Well, this office is not a garage, so will you Which one of you is McMann?
Neither.
I'm Mr. Tate.
What is it you want?
I wanna see Mr. McMann.
His name comes first.
He's gotta be the honcho here.
I happen to be the brightest copywriter to ever set foot on Madison Avenue.
Well, Mr. McMann is chairman of the board.
Mr. Tate is the president.
And as president, I'd advise you to hop back on your cycle and buzz off.
Tail of newt and eye of bat.
This is where the spell is at.
Even though it's what he'd hate.
Now all I say appeals to Tate.
Well, I'm gonna buzz off now, but I thought a man in your position was interested in ideas.
We're perfectly capable of coming up with our own ideas.
I was talking to Mr. Tate.
And I liked what you were saying.
You know, if you have some ideas, of course I want to hear them.
But how did you happen to pick McMann & Tate?
Because I've seen your ads, Daddy.
You need me.
That is pretty insulting.
Darrin.
Let's not be rude to our guest.
Why don't we step into our office, Mr My name's Alonzo.
Alonzo.
Now, don't you let anybody steal my chopper.
Right on!
Come in, sit down.
Put it right there.
Alonzo, I would like to point out to you that McMann & Tate is a very successful advertising agency.
And we don't need people wandering in off the street passing out advice.
Who is he?
He's one of our top account executives, Darrin Stephens.
Oh, man, what a bad scene.
What this agency needs is to radically modify its advertising concepts.
What you need is words with inner meaning, words that sing and are in tune with universal vibrations.
Universal vibrations?
Words that sing.
Now, that grabs me.
Mr. Tate, I'm a philosopher and a poet.
Words are my bag.
I can tune your advertising copy to the rhythm that beats through everybody like a cosmic drum.
Can you dig it?
I can, I can.
Well, I can't.
I mean this in the nicest way possible, but my approach is only for people with special sensitivities.
You know what I mean?
One of your shortcomings, Darrin.
Oh, fine.
You two can enjoy your sensitivity class.
I've got better things to do.
Alonzo, are you familiar with Monticello Carpets?
Now, wait a minute, Larry.
We're all set with our ideas for Monticello.
It can't hurt to hear what this young man has to offer.
As you pointed out, Darrin, he just came in off the street and that's exactly who we're trying to reach.
The man in the street.
Mr. Tate, I think you dig my philosophy.
I do, I do.
Well, let's see what I can come up with for Monticello.
Uh, Larry, don't tell me you're going to fall for this rubbish.
Darrin, it's not my fault if you don't dig the universal vibrations.
ALONZO : Om.
Beautiful.
Om.
He's got it.
I hope it's not contagious.
What are you doing?
"Om" is the sound of the vibrations and motions of the energy of nature and the universe.
It helps me meditate.
On Monticello Carpets?
Om.
I've got it!
He's got it!
Well, let's see it, Alonzo, let's see it.
Now, I don't guarantee you're gonna like it, but all I can say is this is in tune with the human pulsations of all mankind and you're gonna feel it throughout your whole being.
FLURPITY FLURP!
Flurpity Flurp?
I didn't say Flurpity Flurp.
I said FLURPITY FLURP!
Okay, Larry, now what do you think of your?
Bravo, bravo!
Well, I don't get it.
Why not?
It's obvious.
I'm afraid the simplicity of it's too much for him, but that's all right, I'll explain.
Flurpity Flurp is the sound of bare feet on a Monticello carpet.
Of course, of course.
It makes you think of the silky softness of a priceless Comanche prayer rug.
It's like a poem.
Don't stop now, Alonzo.
See what else you can come up with.
Right on.
Excuse me, I'm gonna plug in to the universal energy.
Larry Shh!
Om.
Om.
Larry, just because a guy has a lot of hair doesn't mean he's a genius.
And because he stands on his head and says "Om" doesn't mean he's a philosopher.
Believe me, there are deeper thoughts in fortune cookies.
Darrin, I know you mean well, and I realize that you feel your position at McMann & Tate is being threatened by a talented newcomer.
But there is no I'm beginning to think there is more to this newcomer than meets the eye.
Excuse me, I've gotta make a call.
Hello?
Sam, your mother, the Wicked Witch of the West, has struck again.
What happened?
She sent some freak named Alonzo in here with a lot of weird ideas, and apparently put a spell on Larry to love them all.
One thing you can say about my mother: She's a mother-in-law.
The one thing I can say about your mother is censorable.
I'll get in touch with her right away.
In the meantime, I'll try and fight off this weirdo.
O-o-okay.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye.
Hummingbird and dragonfly wings.
Palm and Borrego Springs.
Timbuktu and Irish stew.
Wherever you are, let's hear from you.
Mother!
Mom.
Om.
Mr. Tate, I've got it.
The absolute, ultimate, the jewel in the bud of the lotus.
Words that sing?
Not this time.
Now, you're gonna get it right away, Mr. Tate, but Mr. Stephens may need a few words of preparation.
That's for sure.
Now, white is the symbol of purity, of flawlessness, of transcendental beauty, and I've tried to tie this all in with Monticello Carpets.
A blank page?
That's where I start my ideas.
And then clutter them up?
What do you think, Mr. Tate?
Far out.
And how is anybody going to identify this with the product?
Well, the card isn't really blank.
"Monticello Carpets".
Alonzo, we're going to present these ideas at the meeting this afternoon.
I'd better be there with our backup ideas, just in case Mr. Cushman has an attack of his usual good judgment.
He's very down, Mr. Tate.
Alonzo's right.
Maybe we'd better handle this ourselves.
Darrin, have the Art Department put a mat around this.
Uh, Larry, I am not the office boy.
Not yet.
Larry, the ideas that this weirdo is coming up with are nothing.
A typical reactionary comment.
If you know so much, maybe you should find yourself a nice little empty office and start your own agency.
I don't want to stand in your way.
Larry, there's something I wish I could tell you, 'cause I know it would change your view, but I can't.
What is it?
I just told you.
Told me what?
That I can't tell you.
Darrin, why don't you leave us alone?
Alonzo and I have work to do.
Right.
I think I'll go and have a drink of lunch.
Hi.
Sam.
Larry told me I'd find you here.
What's more important is, did you find your mother?
Well, she's sort of got her phone off the hook.
Naturally, you didn't get anyplace with Larry.
Nowhere.
And I have a good mind to quit.
Uh-uh, Darrin, don't do that.
I have a feeling that's exactly what mother is up to.
What do you mean?
Well, if you're out of a job, she figures that we can go to Panda's wedding next weekend.
You're kidding.
If I know my mother Sam, what amazes me is that a wonderful person like you could have such a monster for a mother.
I'll, uh, pretend that was a compliment.
Exactly how did you leave things with Larry?
He practically dared me to open my own agency.
Why don't you?
No, that wouldn't be fair.
I mean, after all, he is under a spell.
He's under a spell to like Alonzo's ideas, not to invite you to quit.
Yeah.
And one low blow deserves another.
What's more, there is a vacant office right across the hall from McMann & Tate.
Terrific.
Could you, uh, use a little witchly help?
You know, Sam, I think maybe this is an occasion where we could bend the rules a bit.
Now, uh, for your sign.
Something distinguished, but not too small.
Mm.
Uh mm.
Incidentally, that's 24-karat gold.
But if you prefer platinum, I think Ah-ah-ah.
Don't tamper with perfection.
Hi, Larry.
Oh, hello, Sam.
Darrin.
What are you doing here?
I'm helping Darrin decorate.
What's that?
That's a sign, Larry.
I know it's a sign.
But what's it doing there?
Well, Larry you're the one who suggested I open my own office.
I didn't say for you to open it right across the hall.
I thought I might get some of your, uh, overflow.
Well, that's very unethical.
How did you get it done so fast?
Darrin's a fast worker.
I ought to know.
I don't think you'll be able to transact much business in an empty office.
Impossible.
How long have you been planning this?
Well, we've only been working on it 20 minutes.
Nice, isn't it?
Mr. Cushman.
Heh.
Oh, hello, Mr. Cushman.
Hello, Stephens.
Uh, Mr. Cushman, I May I present my wife, Samantha?
How do you do, Mr. Cushman?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Uh, Mr. Cushman I've always admired your husband's taste in advertising, and now I see he shows the same good taste in choosing a wife.
Well, that's very flattering.
But don't give him too much credit.
I picked him.
Well, shall we Just a minute.
Is that something new?
Oh, yes.
In fact, I have some ideas you might be interested in after your meeting.
Shall we go in?
Fine.
Hope to see you again, Mrs. Stevens.
Just flow over any time.
I guess I'd better see if I can cancel out.
Alonzo's powers of persuasion.
Sam?
Right here, sweetheart.
See you later.
Mr. Cushman, I want you to meet Alonzo, a far-out young genius who just joined the company.
Peace, baby.
I'm gonna lay it on you.
By applying the philosophical concepts of modern Zen to advertising, those who see the ads will feel a real compulsion to buy the product.
In this case, Monticello Carpets.
An enormously exciting approach.
Zen in advertising?
Well, this business is cracky.
Who knows?
Ah, you start him off, Alonzo.
Let him have it.
Mr. Cushman, baby, here are some words that sing.
Flurpity Flurp?
Those aren't even words.
As for singing, they only hiccup a little.
It's the seductive sound of bare feet on a carpet.
Groove on.
Pretty soon, you're gonna feel the universal vibrations  And they gonna touch you.
Ow, that's hot.
Wait a minute.
There's a witch in here.
A witch?
What's this guy on?
I can sense it, I can feel it.
Oh, what a bummer.
Tail of newt and eye of bat.
Take the spell off this here cat I'm gonna split.
This room has bad vibes.
Who dragged him in here?
Darrin.
It was Darrin who warned me about him, but I didn't listen.
Speaking of Darrin, I think I'll just flow across the hall and meet with him.
Uh, no, no, no, I would hardly recommend Darrin.
I mean, I would heartily recommend Darrin.
That's very generous of you.
Mr. Cushman, why go across the hall and talk to Darrin, when it's been me who's been training him all these years?
I mean, draining him.
I mean, most of his ideas are mine anyway.
I mean, I make them mine.
Ah, the most humane thing I can do for you now is to leave.
Flurpity Flurp!
How could I?
"Wall to wall love.
Monticello Carpets".
It's simple, has a certain elegance, and tells a story.
What do you think, Mrs. Stephens?
Well, I'm prejudiced, but I love it.
I think I do, too.
Stevens, you've got a deal.
Hey, great, Mr. Cushman.
Darrin.
About the new agency and the, uh, Monticello Carpet account.
Don't you think?
Yeah.
But I'll let Larry stew a while before I give in.
Hi, Sam.
Larry.
I was just on my way home and I thought I'd drop in.
This isn't on your way home.
Darrin, Larry's trying to make a gesture.
Well, I'm making one too.
Goodbye.
Come on in, Larry.
Here.
Oh, were you expecting me?
Well, we always keep an extra for the drop-in trade.
Heh.
I just wanted to say that in spite of everything, we can still be friends.
Oh, well, let's drink to that.
Of course, the office won't seem the same without you.
We've had some great times, Darrin.
We're both going to miss them.
Larry, are you asking Darrin to come back?
No.
I just wanted him to know that I still have the highest regard for him.
How'd you do with Cushman?
Locked it up.
You sold him the ideas we had?
He loved them.
You ingrate.
Ingrate?
Right.
You took advantage of one little mistake.
A tiny error in judgment on my part.
What do you mean?
Well, it's obvious.
Since I'm never wrong, you very shrewdly waited for the one inevitable moment when I would make that little slip that proves that nobody's perfect.
Then you cunningly took advantage of it, making it look like I fired you.
Would you like to repeat that, Larry?
Not necessarily.
What hurts me is that I recommended you to Cushman.
Heartily.
Well, I I think in that case, Darrin, you should, uh, forgive and forget.
But first, let's have an understanding.
I want to do something special for you.
Oh, that's not necessary.
I insist.
Name it.
Uh, no.
I'll let you name it.
How does this sound?
McMann, Tate & Stephens.
It sounds great.
Well, one of these days, if you keep out of any future trouble, that's the way it's going to read.
Ciao.
I thought you put a spell on him.
I did.
Well, what happened to McMann, Tate & Stephens?
I tried.
It just proves that where Larry is concerned even witchcraft has its limits.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Okay, who's the wise witch?
Sam, did you call me?
No.
What are these doing here?
I thought I left them in my briefcase.
What would you like for breakfast?
In fact, I'm sure I left them in my briefcase.
Sam, did you?
No, I didn't.
But I did.
Sam, since when did your mother get the idea that our marriage license was her deed to my briefcase?
Is it wrong for a mother to try to protect her little girl?
Mother, that's what I love about your little visits.
You always bring a ray of sunshine into an otherwise drab existence.
You're half right.
It certainly is a drab existence.
Sam, I think I'll skip breakfast.
Endora.
Mm.
It's always a pleasure to say goodbye to you.
Mother Now that you have invaded our privacy, would you like to babysit tonight?
Oh.
Darrin and I are celebrating the anniversary of our first date.
Must you rub it in?
Don't you care if Durwood's briefcase contains a gaggle of centerfolds?
Oh, Mother.
In advertising, beautiful girls are merely tools of the trade.
How can a witch of mine be so naive?
Mother.
What?
Models like that are just routine.
Have you ever heard of a syndrome peculiar to mortal men?
The seven-year itch?
Seven years marriage, and it's off with the old and on with the new.
In case you hadn't noticed, Darrin and I have been married for eight years.
You see?
Durwood can't do anything right.
He can do everything right.
I ought to know.
Lady, thou doth protest too much, methinks.
Mother, thou doth butt in too much, methinks.
Mother?
What?
Are you going to babysit with the kids tonight or not?
Of course, darling.
I'll be back in plenty of time.
Queevy, quavy, English navy Stiglum, staglum, cat.
C-A-T spells "cat".
Ophelia, my sweet.
Come, catch a rat Ophelia.
As a familiar, you shouldn't have too much trouble getting familiar with a mortal dud named Durwood.
No.
No.
No.
I'm sorry, gentlemen, but she is just not here.
Mr. Burkeholder, we have to have a cat lady on that tractor before the regional convention in Albany, which, I hasten to remind you, is tonight.
I must admit, we have seen a lot of gorgeous creatures, but I have not seen that certain quality we had in last year's cat girl.
Yes?
BETTY : Mr. Stephens, there's a young lady here to see you.
Not now, Betty.
It's another model.
I think you ought to see this one.
Okay, send her in.
Good afternoon.
My name is Ophelia.
A friend suggested I might be perfect as your cat girl.
What's the trouble?
Cat got your tongue?
I don't know about you fellas, but I I think we've found our girl.
She's perfect.
Well, I'll admit, she looks good, but shouldn't we check out?
Darrin, we don't have much time.
And Mr. Burkeholder likes what he sees.
So take Ophelia down to the still lab and get started on the photos.
But Larry, how can we be convinced that she's?
Just look.
Not at her, at him.
Now, that's pretty convincing.
Okay, Ophelia, first we've gotta fit you in a costume.
While we're shooting the stills, I'll brief you on tonight's activities in Albany.
In Albany?
Mm-hm.
We're having the annual sales convention up there.
I'll explain it to you as we go.
Why don't you try leaning back against this?
Oh.
There.
Legs out?
Yeah, fine.
Okay.
That looks pretty good.
Okay, Chet, she's all yours.
Okay.
Now, watch the birdie.
Birdie?
Where?
Where?
Oh, right here.
Ooh.
Wow, that's it.
Okay, that's it.
Well, Darrin, you picked the perfect model.
Thank you.
Well, actually, she picked us.
Yes, thanks to Darrin.
Let's take a break.
Would you like some cream in your coffee?
No, just cream.
I'm on a diet.
Ophelia.
Chet.
Well, how's the crash program coming?
Just great.
She's terrific, Mr. Tate.
Yes, Mr. Stephens gives me a great deal of confidence.
Well, uh, did Mr. Stephens get the opportunity to brief you on the convention tonight?
Oh, yes.
I don't think there'll be any trouble whatsoever.
Mr. Stephens puts me so at ease, that his very presence is all I need to overcome any stage fright I might have.
Never mind, Ophelia.
You'll be just fine on your own.
On my own?
You mean you won't be there?
Well, no.
You'll be in the very capable hands of Mr. Tate and Mr. Burkeholder.
Oh.
I think I'm having an attack of panic.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Tate, but without Mr. Stephens, I'm afraid I'd make a mess of it.
I'd be as nervous as a cat.
Don't you worry your head about it, Ophelia.
Darrin will be there.
Right, Svengali?
Wrong.
Stephens, what gave you the idea that you didn't have to go to Albany tonight?
Yeah, where'd you get that idea?
Yesterday, when you told me it wouldn't be necessary for me to go.
Why would I tell you that when it's been planned all along?
All along?
Oh, I I don't want to impose on Mr. Stephens.
He's been so kind.
I don't want to inconvenience him in any way.
Believe me, Ophelia, it's no inconvenience.
I'll try not to trouble you in any way whatsoever.
What really bugs me is why I keep giving in to Larry's ultimatums.
Larry's ultimatums are merely a cry for help.
You know that, and that's why you're going to Albany.
So don't worry about it.
We can celebrate tomorrow night.
No.
I've got a better idea.
This stays here.
I'll fly back right after the banquet.
I can be home easily by midnight.
We'll go out and have a romantic, candlelit supper.
That sounds great.
We'll need a sitter.
You haven't let your mother off the hook, have you?
Oh, no.
No, I'm sure she's still around.
Good.
Tell her not to go away.
See you later.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Oh, good heavens.
Well, did you get all that, or would you like an instant replay?
First he's hiding pictures.
Then he breaks a dinner date to be with another woman, in another city.
He will be back by midnight, so you'll have to babysit after all.
Oh, guess what.
What?
Brace yourself for a famous first from Darrin to you: Don't go away.
Ah.
You couldn't have made a more wonderful choice.
I declare, I don't know who deserves the more credit, you or Stephens.
Or me.
Oh.
Mr. Stephens deserves all the credit.
Yeah, well, remember, Ophelia.
I'm right next door.
And I'm just down the hall, in case you need anything.
And I'm on my way to the airport.
I've gotta catch the 11:00 plane.
Bon voyage.
Congratulations, Ophelia.
You were just great.
See you tomorrow, Larry.
Mr. Burkeholder.
Good night.
Good night.
Good night.
Ophelia, I know a nice little restaurant just outside town where we could go for a nightcap.
Well, Mr. Burkeholder, I'm a little tired.
All I want to do is go and curl up and sleep so that I can be bright-eyed and bushy-tailed in the morning.
But you're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed right now.
In the morning.
In the morning.
In the morning, what?
Good night.
Mr. Stephens' room, please.
Hello?
Hello, Mr. Stephens.
This is Reservations at Mohawk Airlines.
Your 11:00 flight for New York has been canceled.
Canceled?
Why?
We're completely socked in.
Socked in?
It's clear as a bell here.
Soup there, hm.
And we don't expect it to lift until morning.
Yeah.
Well, if it does lift, will you call me right away?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Meow.
Hi, sweetheart.
How'd it go?
Everything went great but the weather.
The airport fogged in, and, well, I guess I'm stuck here for the night.
Oh, well, sweetheart, you can't do anything about the weather.
Maybe I could get a car and drive down.
Sweetheart, that's ridiculous.
It's a three-hour drive.
I'll see you in the morning.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Well, mwah, love you.
Mwah, mwah.
Love you too.
Bye-bye.
Let me guess: Another excuse, another delay.
Darrin can't come home tonight because the airport's fogged in.
Mother, you haven't, by any chance, been horsing around with the weather, have you?
If anybody's been horsing around, it's probably Durwood.
You didn't answer my question.
I did not horse around with the weather.
Witch's honor.
But I'll give Durwood credit for one thing.
He has no imagination.
What's that supposed to mean?
The weather is so easily checked.
Mother, you're beginning to bug me.
When are you ever going to start showing some good sense?
Mother, would you like to look at someone showing good sense?
Yes.
Okay.
Then take a look at me not paying any attention to you.
I have an errand to run.
Ta-ta.
Yes?
You called for room service, sir?
Well, no, I didn't Oh, hello, Mr. Stephens.
I thought you were going back to New York.
Well, so did I, but my flight was canceled.
Oh, isn't that a shame?
Were you ordering a nightcap?
No.
I'm sorry, you must have the wrong room.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Stephens, I can't tell you how relieved I am.
About what?
Well, I am sorry that your flight was canceled, but it certainly is comforting that you'll be here for tomorrow's TV interviews.
I'm afraid I won't be here.
I'll be flying back first thing in the morning.
Oh, um, well, then maybe we can discuss the questions tonight.
There are a few places I'd like to scratch.
I mean, cut.
Sure.
Come on in.
Maybe we should have a nightcap.
Okay, I'll call room service.
No, no, no.
I'll go get mine.
I have some.
Would you ring Mr. Larry Tate, please?
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
I know I was leaving, but the airport got socked in, and I'm stuck here for the night.
Uh, look, would you come over?
Why?
Well, Ophelia wants to go over the material for her television interviews, and, well, the fact is, I I would rather not be alone with her.
I think we've got a bad connection.
I thought I heard you say come over because you didn't wanna be alone with her.
That's exactly what I said.
Darrin, you're not well.
I'll be right over.
Hello.
Oh, hi.
Thanks, Ophelia, for bringing this.
Hi, Lar Uh, Larry.
Hi.
Ophelia, uh, you remember Larry Tate.
Oh, yes.
How nice to see you, Mr. Tate.
Hi.
Ophelia wanted to go over some of the questions she'll be asked at the television interviews.
If they need a little, uh Larry?
Of course, if they need a little, uh A little what?
Fixing.
If they need a little fixing, who am I to argue?
To your very good health, Ophelia.
I have a weather report from Albany.
Fair and warmer and clear.
Mother, I'm sure if that's true, Darrin has a logical answer.
Sure.
And I'm Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Mother, I am going to get Aunt Hagatha to babysit while we go to Albany.
We?
Why we?
Well, no matter what the weather is there, Darrin is lost in a fog, and I wanna find out whose.
Present company included.
Well, if these changes will make you happy, we'll be glad to make them.
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
Shall I make another drink?
Thank you.
I thought you'd never ask.
On second thought, Larry, I can handle the rest of the evening by myself.
Why don't you run back to your room.
Why?
I thought we were about I'll be glad to go to my room.
After all, two's company, three's a crowd.
Larry, where are you going?
To my room.
What for?
I don't know.
But I don't think it was my idea.
As a matter of fact, I think I'll have that second drink.
But not before I take a nap.
All right.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
I should've known: Ophelia, doing what comes naturally.
Samantha, how nice to see you.
You could've knocked.
Never mind about her.
What about him?
Caught in the act.
In what act?
If you don't know, it's too late to teach you.
Ophelia, would you care to tell me who sicced you on my husband?
Your husband?
Oh, come off it, Ophelia.
I wanna know what this is all about.
Samantha, you know that, as a familiar, I only follow orders.
Ah-ha.
Mother?
Are you the one who let the cat out of the bag?
Well Endora, I'm not taking the rap on my own.
If there's anything I can't abide, it's a stool pigeon.
I'm leaving.
Mother, you'll get yours.
Ophelia, are you going to tell me what's going on, or would you rather I zapped up a hungry bulldog?
All right.
Endora, with your best interests at heart, merely wanted to test your mate's mettle.
Darrin can handle himself, as long as you don't pull any hocus-pocus.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, knock it off, Ophelia.
I know Darrin.
You're not his type.
You wanna make a friendly wager on that?
No, but I'll make an unfriendly one, just as long as you let Darrin act of his own free will.
All spells off, and do your worst, Ophelia.
Darrin, may I call you Darrin?
Well, certainly.
I have a confession to make.
What's that?
I know it sounds silly, but the truth is, I've never met a man who made me feel so secure.
I mean, so perfectly content.
Well, uh, thank you very much.
Heh.
I I mean, uh, well, that's very flattering, but Don't you find me attractive?
Oh, uh, of course.
Of course.
Uh, that's the problem.
That, and the fact that I'm married.
I love married men.
I adore married men.
They're so So Uh, married is what they are.
Oh, well, look at Larry.
I wonder what's wrong with him.
Oh.
That was a very refreshing nap.
I think I'll I'll have another one.
Ophelia, there's something strange going on around here.
And no offense, but I'm not waiting around to find out what it is.
Uh, Larry?
Larry?
Larry, I'm going to the airport to wait for the fog to lift.
If you wanna sleep, why don't you do it in your own room?
Hm.
I feel great, so you just run along, and I'll take care of whatever problems Ophelia has.
Okay, Larry.
See you tomorrow.
So long, Ophelia.
Good luck tomorrow.
Well, I guess I'll have that little drink.
Can I fix you something?
Yes, please.
Now what?
Ophelia, I know this is none of my business, but Louise Tate happens to be a good friend.
On second thought, I'd better be getting back to my room.
Of course, if you can't stay, I'll understand.
You will?
Mm.
I wish you'd explain it to me.
Ophelia, my sweet, what makes you second best is you try too hard.
Ta-ta.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Thought you were gonna be stuck in Albany.
Well, so did I. The darnedest thing happened.
I decided to go to the airport to wait for the fog to lift and when I got there, there wasn't any fog.
I was gonna call you, but I barely made my plane.
Oh, well, that happens sometimes.
The fog lifts.
That's not what happened.
There never was any fog, which means somebody has been horsing around with our evening.
I I know.
I know, sweetheart.
And she promised she'd never do it again.
Promised whom?
You.
And the world.
Come on out back.
She said she'd have something for you when you got home.
Sam, you mean everybody can see that?
Anyone who's looking.
I'm certainly glad your mother can't remember my name.
Yes.
There are times when it's a blessing, aren't there?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Sweetheart?
Mm?
What time's your lunch meeting?
At 1:00.
Hey, I better get going.
Hello?
Oh, hi.
Oh, really?
Well, that's wonderful.
I'll certainly tell him.
Bye-bye.
Tell who about what?
You.
About something I don't think you're gonna be too happy about.
You remember the tip on those two horses in the daily double that Abner Kravitz gave you yesterday?
Don't tell me they won?
Okay, I won't tell you.
Uh-oh.
What did the double pay?
A bundle.
And he bought Mrs. Kravitz a diamond ring with his winnings.
Naturally, she couldn't wait to tell me about it.
It's too bad that Durwood is afraid to take a chance.
Then maybe he'd win a bundle and get you a diamond ring.
Endora, must you always invade our house without warning?
Of course not.
Watch out!
Good morning, children.
Good morning, Mother.
Goodbye, Endora.
Mother.
Hm.
In answer to your question, I already have a diamond ring.
Oh, really?
Then why don't you wear it?
I am wearing it.
Oh, there's the little fella.
Mother, you are not at your best when you try humor.
Oh, Samantha, I was just trying to make a point.
Durwood is entirely too cautious.
It's no wonder he stays on his dreary little treadmill.
He'll never get anywhere unless he's willing to take a chance.
Mother, I am not going to argue with you.
For two reasons.
First of all, it's useless.
Second of all, I have a lot to do.
And the children are upstairs if you want to say hello.
Mwah.
Oh      By this spell That's oh-so-droll.
You'll receive a gambler's soul.
Double, double Toil and trouble.
To Tabitha's room For the daily double Tabitha, would you like to play a little game with Daddy?
Sure.
Okay, now, you see this list of names?
You close your eyes and put your finger on the one you think is the luckiest.
Then you do the same thing with this next list.
Tomorrow we'll look and see if you picked the right ones.
Okay?
No.
Tell me again.
Forget it.
I think I'll go play with Adam.
He's easier to understand.
MAN'S  Hey, buddy, come here.
Who's that?
Me, the hobbyhorse.
I'm a present from your mother-in-law.
That loveliest of persons.
My mother-in-law, lovely?
Look, Mac, it's her spell.
You want today's daily double?
Get on my back.
What?
Why?
You got me.
It's not my spell.
Okay, rock.
Rock?
Sure.
Why do you think they call me a rocking horse?
Oh, that's nice.
Now, in the first race, Baleful Bob is the winner.
And the second race?
Put your money on Don's Pawn.
Don's Pawn.
Ride a cock horse To Banbury Cross.
See Darrin Stephens Upon a white horse.
I I, uh Well, it looked a little unsteady.
I, uh, wanted to make sure it was safe for the kids.
I thought you'd left for the office.
How could I leave when I'm still here?
Are you all right?
You look a little flushed.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Uh, but I better get going.
I don't wanna be late for my hunch.
I mean, uh, lunch.
Tabitha.
Tabitha?
Yes, Mommy.
Uh, sweetheart, did Grandmama come up to visit you in your room this morning?
Yes.
Did anything, uh, funny happen?
Well, when she made my rocking horse talk it was pretty funny.
Terrific.
Is anything wrong?
Nothing that Grandmama can't straighten out.
Mo  Tabitha, sometimes when I call Grandmama, she doesn't want to appear.
Why don't you call her?
Okay.
Grandmama, please come.
"Never send a girl to do a woman's work.
Your loving mother".
Ah!
I'm glad you suggested this place, Mr. Spengler.
The food is excellent.
Yes and quite reasonable.
You know, I'd really forgotten how much fun a cafeteria can be.
Oh, incidentally, my offer to flip you for lunch is still good.
No, no, it's my treat.
I don't like to feel obligated.
Something else I don't like and that's irresponsibility.
Where is this genius of yours?
Well, it's not like Stephens to be late.
I'm sure he'll have a reasonable explanation.
He'd better.
Thank you.
Hi, Larry.
Mr. Spengler.
I'm sorry to be late, but I got this terrific tip on the daily double.
So I stopped at one of the off-track betting places to make a bet.
You're joking, of course.
He's joking.
No, I'm not.
Will you take that thing out of your ear?
Not now, Larry.
My first horse already won and the results of the second race are due.
Darrin, this is supposed to be a business meeting.
I'll tell you what.
I've got $20 bet.
I'll give you each $5 of my action.
Thank you, but I'm not a betting man.
Shh, I'm getting the results.
Well, this is ridiculous.
Well, you know these creative geniuses.
They all have a screw loose somewhere.
I hit it.
I won the daily double.
Paid $89.
That's 89 times 10.
I won $890.
Now aren't you sorry you didn't accept my offer?
In about a minute, I'm going to make you an offer.
To accept your resignation.
I don't know what you're sore about.
I offered you each $5 of my bet.
It's not my fault that you lost, uh $222.50 each.
We're going to lose a lot more than that if we don't get down to business.
Stephens, where'd you get that tip on the daily double?
Yeah, where did you get that tip?
Well, I have an absolutely unbeatable source.
I'm not a betting man, but this is very impressive.
Yes, very impressive.
But, uh, let's get back to our business discussion, shall we?
I've got a better idea.
Let's get back to my house.
What for?
That's where my source is.
I think it would be better if we went directly to the nearest psychiatrist.
I wouldn't mind placing a small bet.
Neither would I. As I say, I'm not a betting man, but this is one time business can wait.
Now you're talking, sport.
Oh!
Oh, uh, sorry.
Mother.
I know you've been horsing around with a spell on Darrin.
Or should I say "hobbyhorsing around"?
For the last time, will you please show up?
Where have you been?
Hovering.
I was waiting to give you the price on the daily double.
For your information, Durwood won $890.
You tell me the last time that dimwit made that kind of money.
Mother, you know perfectly well that fixing races is strictly I did not do any fixing, Samantha.
I did a little predicting.
Okay.
You know perfectly well that predicting anything is strictly against witch ethics.
And you know perfectly well that with mortals, anything goes.
It's also against mortal ethics.
Which is further proof of Durwood's lack of character.
Anyway, Darrin isn't entitled to that money.
He won it through witchcraft.
Oh, well, if that's your attitude That's my attitude, all right.
And I would very much appreciate it if you would pop upstairs and take the spell off that hobbyhorse.
And when Darrin comes home  There are nine horses in the seventh race.
Oh, great, that's 9-to-1 odds.
Is that the way they figure?
Oh, I don't know.
What's he doing home so early?
If I know these greedy mortals, you're about to see three men on a horse.
Mother, do something about that hobbyhorse, please.
Ooh, very well.
Come on in, make yourselves comfortable.
I'll get in touch with my source.
Oh, hi, Sam.
Hi, Samantha.
Hi, Larry.
Mr. Spengler, meet my wife, Samantha.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mr. Spengler?
Sam, I won the daily double.
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.
Well, we're in kind of a rush.
I have to talk to you.
Do you mind if we do it on the way upstairs?
Excuse us.
Certainly.
Mother?
I wonder where she went.
Darrin, I don't think that's gonna do you any good.
Mother promised she'd take the spell off that horse.
Don't say that, Sam, even in jest.
Okay, I want the winner of the seventh race.
In the seventh race, put your money on Count of Valor.
Well, so much for Mother's promises.
Darrin, try to control yourself.
Use your willpower.
It won't do any good.
It might.
What odds will you give?
I've got to find my mother, the fink.
Um, okay, what about the eighth race?
In the seventh race, put your money on Count of Valor.
What's the matter with you?
This is a recording.
I'll have to be satisfied with one sure winner.
Win a few, lose a few, eh, Irving?
With what I won in the daily double, and counting my original bet, I've got over $900 in my account.
I'm gonna put half of this on Count of Valor.
How much do you fellas want?
Well, I don't know.
How come you only got one race?
I told you, that's all my source gave me.
Don't know how much time I have.
Put you down for something.
Darrin, wait.
I can't now.
But But, uh, Darrin Darrin, listen.
Darrin, please.
Darrin, I uh.
I wish you'd think this over.
Every one of these handicappers picks Count of Valor on top but only if you turn the paper upside down.
Sam, the rocking horse knows.
A rocking horse doesn't read the paper.
Look at what this fellow says about Count of Valor: "Couldn't beat a fat man up a hill".
Now, doesn't that make you wonder about your source?
It's the same source that gave me the winners of the daily double.
But a source can dry up or even get mad.
Hello, I'd like to place a bet.
My account number is A231.
My code name is Dog.
And so's your horse.
Yeah, I'd like to place a bet in the seventh race at Aqueduct.
Got to find that woman I used to call Mother.
I hope he doesn't make too large a bet for us.
Okay.
We're all set.
I put you down for 2 apiece.
Two, that's all?
We came all this way and you only put $2 down for us?
No.
Two hundred.
Two hundred?
Darrin, isn't that an awful lot of money for such a long shot?
Well, I'm down for 400.
If you don't wanna bet 200 each, I'll take your action.
But don't forget what happened at lunch today.
I'll take the 200.
Me too.
I think they broadcast the feature race on TV on Saturdays.
Maybe we can watch it.
Yeah, there it is.
Let's drive down to the off-track betting station and watch the race.
That way we'll be closer to our money.
Oh, that's a good idea.
Oh, great.
Let's hurry.
Sam, we're going back downtown to watch the race.
You wanna come with us?
No, thank you.
I'm still looking for you-know-who.
Well, see you later.
Mm.
Bye, Sam.
Goodbye.
Good luck.
Mother?
Mother, I may be sticking my neck out, but if you don't show up this minute, your grandchildren are gonna be off-limits to you.
There's no need for you to stick your neck out.
Where have you been?
Oh around.
I thought you said you were gonna do something about that rocking horse.
I did.
That's what I was afraid of.
Did you feed Darrin a loser?
That's what you wanted, isn't it?
You said he didn't deserve the money.
I agree.
He doesn't.
So I arranged for him to lose it.
That's logical, isn't it?
Logical and mean.
Yes.
Isn't it?
Mother, you're right about Darrin.
He's only losing the money he won earlier.
But what about Larry and the client?
They don't deserve to lose $200 apiece.
And they'll just blame Darrin.
Oh, what a shame.
But you know very well we can't tamper with the future.
Hm.
I know.
Maybe I could give that horse some encouragement.
Uh, Mother, would you mind staying with the children?
Where are you going?
I think I'll pop down to the track and find that horse.
And try and talk a little people sense into him.
Shh.
Sorry, fella.
Now, you just calm down.
Just calm down.
Now, listen, I'd like to have a little talk with you and, uh, maybe I should fix it so that, uh, you can have a little talk with me too.
Oh.
Now we can communicate.
Say, how did you do that?
I'm a witch.
Oh, sure, and I'm Pegasus.
Well, if you were, you might move a little faster.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.
You haven't won a race in over a year.
Well, who needs you to remind me?
Why haven't you been winning?
I'm not as dumb as I look.
You see, if I keep losing races, how long do you think it'll be before they put me out to pasture?
Huh?
If I'm lucky, this will be my last race.
But what about your pride?
Do you know what those handicappers have been saying about you?
Why Oops.
Looks like we've got company.
Hi, there.
Who were you talking to?
This horse.
Oh.
You usually talk to horses?
Well, yes.
When I bet on them.
You put money on this nag?
Shh.
Don't say things like that in front of him.
You'll hurt his feelings.
Ma'am, if this bangtail had any feelings, he would run away.
If he knew how to run.
See?
He resents that.
That's more action than he shows on the track.
If Count of Valor doesn't win any races, are you gonna retire him to pasture?
More than likely retire him to the glue factory.
Well, I have a feeling the Count is gonna make an all-out effort this afternoon.
Aren't you?
I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up in the winner's circle.
I think he does understand you.
Of course he does.
You want me to walk you to the paddock?
Hey, Mac.
Yeah.
You want a tip on a sure thing in the seventh?
Count of Valor.
ANNOUNCER : The horses are at the gate.
Now, that's a good-looking horse.
This is not a beauty contest, Darrin.
Hi.
Hi, Sam.
What are you doing here?
Don't get up.
So you changed your mind, huh?
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd drop by.
It is now post time.
Sam, what do you think?
The odds on Count of Valor have dropped from 30-to-1 to 5-to-1.
Really?
That groom must be a real blabbermouth.
Who?
The flag is up.
There they go.
Count of Valor, dwelt at the start.
It's Sirocco going to the front, Mail Bag is What's "dwelt" polite for?
Left at the gate.
Well, at least he's going in the right direction.
Count of Valor is trailing.
It's Sirocco Stephens, are you sure you got the right horse?
He'll catch up.
Only if they race to Albany.
Where is our horse?
I don't see him.
For $200, you'd think you'd get a look at him.
And Count of Valor still trails.
There he is.
Isn't he cute?
I think we've been had.
Exactly what I've been thinking.
Give him time.
He doesn't have any time left.
Sweetheart, if that's the way they feel, why don't you let them off the hook?
Okay, you're off the hook.
Well, I don't want you to feel No need to apologize.
See you back at the office, Darrin.
Aren't you gonna stay and see the end of the race?
And Count of Valor is far back.
It would be kinder not to stand around and watch Darrin lose his money.
Goodbye, Sam.
Indian Red is fourth and Count of Valor Don Pedro moving up on the inside.
Now Count of Valor is beginning to move forward There he goes!
I knew it!
Count of Valor is moving forward.
It's Mail Bag in front.
Blue Coat is second.
Indian Red and Don Pedro.
And here comes Count of Valor on the outside.
Here's Mail Bag, Indian Red, and in the middle of the racetrack is Count of Valor.
Indian Red, Mail Bag, Count of Valor on the outside.
Count of Valor gets up to win it by a head.
Indian Red is second.
Mail Bag is third.
Sam, do you realize I just won $4000 and Larry and Mr. Spengler just blew $1000 each?
Oh, well, if you're lucky they won't find out about it.
Did you see that horse run?
Yeah.
Did you see him come out of nowhere?
He ran like Well, he ran like, um Like he was running for his life?
Yeah.
Sweetheart, I don't blame you for being angry at Mother.
But she did take the spell off and you did win a lot of money.
That's not the point.
Okay, then why don't you give the money to a worthy charity?
That way, Mother will have done her good deed for the week.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Mm-mm.
But Mother will.
You've convinced me.
Oh, hi, Larry.
Hi, Sam.
I was just driving by and Hi, Darrin.
Hi, Larry.
How are you?
Fine.
Uh, how's Mr. Spengler?
Not so fine.
He found out that our horse won.
He did?
How?
They must have leaked it to the newspapers.
You know how he is about money.
And, uh, well, he feels you tricked him.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Of course it is.
You both said you wanted out.
I know.
But with a client you can't always be rational.
Actually, the way Mr. Spengler put it is that he doesn't understand racetrack jargon.
So when Darrin said he'd let him off the hook, it didn't mean a thing to him.
Larry, what are you trying to say?
That in the best interests of preserving the Spengler account, it would be propitious of Darrin to restore Spengler's bet.
That's what I thought you were trying to say.
So when do we get our money?
Did he say "our money"?
That's what I thought I heard.
Well, you're certainly going to give an old friend more consideration than a mere passing client.
You must be kidding.
Sweetheart, you are in an area where Larry does not kid.
But I So in the best interests of preserving a beautiful friendship, and your job, I think you should agree.
Sam, it's people like you that make me proud to be an American.
Gee, thanks.
You're welcome.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
How do you like your French toast, Daddy?
Before you answer, guess who made it.
Tabitha made it.
Who asked you to tell?
It's very good.
I didn't even know you could speak French.
What time is your golf date?
Oh, no special time.
Larry's in Chicago, so our regular foursome isn't playing today.
I have an idea.
Why don't you stay home and spend the day with this foursome?
I might just do that.
More milk, Mommy.
Oh, how about that?
He wants to drink to your staying home.
Mmm.
Tabitha, it's delicious.
Thank you, Daddy.
Emergency.
I'll get that.
You get the milk.
Hmm, got to put peanut butter on the shopping list.
Yes, Mother?
What is Durwood doing here?
If you're referring to Darrin, he lives here.
Ah, ah, ah.
Don't be impertinent.
It was you who suggested that the testing committee come on a Saturday because that's when It plays golf.
Well, this is the wrong Saturday.
He isn't playing today.
Samantha, as chairman of the committee, I can't keep stalling the other members.
Mother, don't put your foot on that tomato.
You'll give it a soft spot, and they're sky high these days.
Oh, now you're trying to stall me.
The witches' council has already asked me why you're so reluctant to have Adam's power shown.
Well Well, if you put it off another time, you might as well come right out and admit that so far he hasn't shown the least talent for witchcraft.
But he's just a baby.
Oh, Samantha, why pretend with me?
At his age, Tabitha was doing all manner of witchcraft.
Now, you get rid of Durwood.
I'm not sure I can.
You'd better try.
You're aware that your father is going to be here for the test?
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
I think I'll try and get Dur Uh, Darrin, out of the house.
Here, Mother, have an apple.
It'll keep the witch doctor away.
Who was at the door?
Oh, one of those survey people.
Sort of a testing poll.
I got rid of her.
Well, Tabitha, if you are through, why don't you take Adam upstairs and get him dressed?
And then you two can run out on the patio and play.
Okay, Mommy.
Come on, Adam.
Your room is messy, Tabitha.
Uh Sweetheart, I've been thinking.
Maybe you ought to play golf today.
But you just talked me into spending the day at home.
Well Uh, now I-I'd like to talk you into playing golf.
Why?
Because you enjoy it, because the exercise is good for you, because I want you to be happy.
This dialogue is utterly depressing.
Endora, would you mind knocking before you pop in?
I thought you were on your way to play a set of golf.
It's a round of golf.
A set of tennis.
Oh, what a stimulating revelation.
Sam, what's going on?
Darrin, trust me.
Go and play golf.
You know you like to play golf.
I like to play golf when I like to play golf, and I want to know what's going on.
Well, if I tell you, you'd just get angry.
I can't get angry, I already am.
Darrin, if you love me, you'll go play golf.
If he loved you, he'd never come back.
Endora, why don't you go play with your snakes?
What on Earth is that?
It's nothing on Earth.
It's your father announcing his arrival.
I'm gonna go play golf.
Thanks.
Girls!
"She walks in beauty, like the night of cloudless climes and starry skies.
And all that's best of dark and bright.
Meet in her aspect and her eyes".
Oh, thank you, Daddy.
You and Byron say the cutest things.
Maurice, this exhibition is absurd, childishly flamboyant, and pathetically egomaniacal.
Thank you, Endora.
Your charm is ageless.
So sad about the rest of you.
Tinkerbell, park the litter.
When is the rest of the committee arriving?
Well, uh, D-Daddy, I'm not sure, and I know how you hate to wait around, so it's all right if you want to leave.
What?
And miss my grandson's coming of age?
Not on your life.
Of course, he's going to pass with flying colors, isn't he?
Well, it all depends on what they ask him to do.
Where is the lad?
Well, he's upstairs getting dressed, Daddy, but I haven't had a chance to A little advance testing wouldn't hurt, would it?
Uh, but But, Daddy  Oh, dear.
Hello, Grandpapa.
Tabitha!
How is my little princess?
Fine.
I can always tell your voice, Grandpapa.
Yes, people say it has a unique quality.
And it's so loud too.
That reminds me, someday we must fly north to see the seals.
Now then, I've got something for you to hear.
Listen.
Listen very carefully.
What do your hear, Adam?
Is it the roar of the sea?
Do you hear the roar of the sea?
Yes.
All right.
Now, I've got another little game for you.
Look, you see this little fella?
See him?
Now, I want you to go over there.
That's it.
Now, I want you to make him come to you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, Adam.
That's the lazy way.
I want you to do it like this.
Now, you can do that, can't you?
No, Grandpa.
Good grief.
Don't tell me my grandson's powers have been temporarily frustrated by his unfortunate lineage.
However, nothing so serious that Grandpapa cannot fix.
Oh, spirits on high, I bid ye now, this child of woe you must endow with powers befitting my descendant and I will act as superintendent.
Now, Adam, shall we go for a short flight?
Ohh!
Bravo!
Bravo!
Rasputin.
Thank you, Rasputin.
You may leave now.
Hello, darling.
Good to see you.
Hello, my dear.
Nice to see you.
Enchanted, Samantha.
Now, where is the little warlock?
Right here, ladies.
Oh!
Oh!
How enchanting.
How adorable.
How sweet.
Grimalda, you look ravishing.
Enchantra, how do you keep your girlish figure?
Well, Maurice, you're certainly a hit with the ladies of the geriatric set.
What a comfort to know you still care.
Now, stop it, you two.
I'm nervous enough.
Let's prepare the room.
Please take your places.
Come, Adam.
Come on.
Daddy!
Rest easy, my dear.
Adam was a little sluggish at first, but I gave him a few pointers.
Pointers?
What do you mean?
It's going to work out all right.
We shall begin with simple levitation.
Enchantra.
See the ball.
The ball is red.
Make the red ball fly to you.
Go ahead, dear.
Try.
No coaching, please.
Go ahead, dear.
Try.
I can't.
He can't!
Oh, dear!
I thought you said everything was going to work out.
It will.
The problem is you're testing him on too elementary a level.
Remember, he's my grandson.
And mine.
Well, he can't help that.
Ask the lad to fly, for example.
Fly?
He can't.
He's too young.
It's unheard of.
For ordinary warlocks, yes, but not for my grandson.
I wish I knew what you were up to.
"Oh, ye of little faith".
Proceed.
As you wish.
Do you want to try to fly?
Okay.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Mommy.
I I can't believe it.
Neither can I. Well, now that that's settled, I suppose we can adjourn.
I second the motion.
Ladies, I'd love to stay, but I have to referee a flying-fish race on the road to Mandalay.
So as Caesar said to Antony, "Fare thee well.
"The elements be kind to thee "and make thy spirits all of comfort".
Mommy, where is Daddy?
He's playing golf.
I wish Daddy was here.
Where did he go?
Where did who go?
Oh, my stars!
Sam, I demand to know what's going on here.
Uh, sweetheart  It's Adam.
Well, he had a sudden attack of wish-craft.
He wished you were here, and here you are.
Since when did he start doing any kind of craft, wish or otherwise?
And who are those old  Watch it!
It's something I thought you'd be happier not knowing.
But, if you insist, I'll fill you in.
I want to apologize for all this.
It's just disgraceful.
Oh, yes, it is.
Absolutely.
I've never been treated like this before in my entire life.
You've got to be kidding.
Sweetheart, you don't know how lucky we are.
When I come home and find the house full of witches I don't consider it lucky.
When you are married to a witch, that's always a possibility, isn't it?
I mean, it sort of goes with the territory.
Yes, but the territory has boundaries, and as far as I'm concerned, what's going on out there is off-limits.
I want those old biddies out of this house.
Here.
Well, oh!
Mama.
Want to see me fly, Daddy?
See him fl Adam, I want you to go upstairs to your room and play.
Adam!
Sweetheart, I think Daddy would like it if you used the stairs.
Okay.
Come on.
Zip on up there, and I'll be up in a while.
Go on.
There you go.
Something's going on here, anyway.
We have to wait and wait  Ladies.
We simply can't.
It's ridiculous.
I know you have other places to go.
Let me get your brooms.
Don't worry, Durwood.
We're leaving as soon as we announce our decision.
What decision?
Since it's quite obvious that Adam is a warlock of incredible genius, it is our opinion that he requires special handling.
Therefore, we have decided to remove him from this dubious environment.
Oh, brother!
That's ridiculous.
There is no need to get hysterical, Durwood.
We're not talking about removing Adam permanently.
No, only for 20 or 30 years.
Sam, you better do something, or I'll do something I'll live to regret.
If I live.
I protest.
On what grounds?
You tested Adam to make sure that a mixed marriage would not affect his powers.
Well, the results should satisfy everyone.
Yes, but that was before we discovered what a prodigy he is.
Adam leaves this house over my dead body.
The notion is tempting but hardly necessary.
This is Adam's home, and this is where he stays.
Young man, will you kindly stop barking at us?
I will not stop.
I am Adam's father, and he's going to be educated as  Oh, dear.
Well, they did warn you.
It is time for us to take our leave now.
Kindly get the boy.
May I be permitted to say something?
No.
Not now.
Just two words?
Very well.
Daddy, help!
What's the trouble, my dear?
Daddy, they want to take Adam.
Take him?
Take him where?
As you know, the child's a prodigy, and the committee has decided that he needs special care.
Special training.
Ridiculous.
Who asked for your opinion?
Maurice, you saw the child fly.
You must admit, flying at Adam's age is incredible.
Ladies, what you don't understand is that Adam was only able to accomplish that miracle because of my presence.
The truth is, he has no power of witchcraft whatsoever.
None whatsoever?
Then how do you explain I gave him a little help.
If the child is completely mortal, that leaves us with no alternative.
None whatsoever.
The marriage must be dissolved.
See?
Every cloud has a silver lining.
Enchantra If Darrin promises to restrain himself, will you please restore his voice?
As you wish.
Sam, tell me this is all a nightmare.
Daddy, don't let them.
I don't want my marriage dissolved.
Just calm down, my dear.
Ladies, as I once said to Will Shakespeare, and later gave him permission to quote me, "The quality of mercy is not strained Hold it.
What has that to do with what we're discussing?
Nothing, but now I have your attention.
Let me tell you what I think the problem is.
This child is being brought up in an atmosphere that has inhibited the growth of his witchcraft.
You see, Samantha's husband, that mortal lamebrain, absolutely forbids the use of witchcraft in this house.
No!
Yes.
No!
Yes.
No!
Why do you keep saying no when I tell you yes?
Now, Samantha, my dear, you are the child's mother.
It is up to you to provide a fertile ground for his natural growth.
Try that, and Adam may surprise you.
I hope so.
Now, Sam, just a minute.
I have something to say Silence!
Adam!
Come over here, Adam.
That's right.
Give me the shell.
Shell into bell, Bell into shell, At knell of bell, Be gone, oh spell.
Now, the little rascal's on his own.
Sweetheart, maybe if I explain something to you in mortal terms, then you might understand.
Now, if Adam had an innate talent for, uh, music, say, and we forbade him to use it, well, that would not only be unfair, but it could be harmful.
Witchcraft is a talent too.
Well, now, isn't that logical?
If you're married to a witch, I guess it's logical.
Adam, watch the shell.
Turn around.
Now, watch this.
Here it comes.
Look at that.
Oh, now, I'm gonna send it back, okay?
Now, you watch.
Back onto the table.
There.
Oh, boy.
One more time, watch!
Here it comes.
Oh, wow.
Now you try it.
It's okay.
There it goes.
It goes, oh, it's Oh!
He did it.
He did it.
That's wonderful.
Just wonderful.
Mine you are, grandson!
Bravo, Adam.
Bravo!
Isn't that terrific?
Yeah.
But the way you're all carrying on, you'd think he'd just taken his first step.
But, sweetheart, that's exactly what he did.
Bye, Samantha.
Goodbye, Maurice.
Au revoir, au revoir.
Bye-bye.
Au revoir.
Very well, Rasputin.
Home!
Well, thank goodness that's over.
Two down and two to go.
I'm thirsty.
Bravo.
Very good, Adam.
Sam Uh, well, I I'll have a talk with him later.
Sweetheart, now, why don't you take your milk out to the kitchen, please?
Okay?
With both hands, now.
There you go.
Well, I must be off.
I'm due at the ballet at Petrograd.
They're doing Penguin Lake.
Don't you mean Swan Lake?
No, it's an ice ballet.
They couldn't get the skates on the swans.
Endora, shall I drop you somewhere?
Over the Matterhorn, perhaps?
I get the point.
Thanks for your help, Daddy.
If it hadn't been for you, I would've had a disaster on my hands.
You still have a disaster on your hands.
Young man, take good care of my little girl or I'll take good care of you.
I've managed pretty well up to now.
I'll be the judge of that.
Farewell!
Farewell!
A long farewell.
If it's going to be that long, I'm not waiting.
Scene stealer.
What a character!
He is rather unique, isn't he?
Yeah, but his daughter is even more unique.
And prettier.
Oh!
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Uh, I guess I'll have to have that little talk with him right now.
Adam, did you pop Mommy into the kitchen?
Yes.
Afterwards, you and I can continue our little talk.
Good idea.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Do these look all right, sweetheart?
Fine, fine.
How about these?
Great, great.
How about this?
Perfect, perfect.
You sure it's not too dressy?
Sam, will you stop kidding around?
We don't want to be late.
We have plenty of time.
Oh, wait a minute.
Let me help you with those.
These business dinners are a pain anyway.
Why do you do it?
It's all part of Larry's selling concept.
Wine, dine, and sign.
Yoo-hoo, Esmeralda.
Oh, Mr. Stephens, you don't have any pants on.
In the privacy of my bedroom, I don't see anything wrong with that.
If I had any privacy.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll just pop down to the kitchen and fix myself some scrambled legs.
Eggs.
Ohh Sam, what is she doing here?
She told you.
Her flaps were flipping when they should've been flapping.
I don't mean in the bedroom.
I mean here.
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help me!
Help me!
Oh, my goodness, how'd I get in here?
Help!
Help!
Sam, don't tell me that Well, it isn't Santa Claus.
Be careful.
Watch your hat now.
Now, you're all upset over nothing.
Just relax and I'll, uh, I'll clean you up.
Sweetheart, would you turn the other way?
With pleasure.
There you are.
Thank you, Samantha.
You're so talented.
Oh, I see you're dressed up to go out.
I guess it's lucky I dropped by.
It is?
I mean, it'll solve your sitter problem.
Well, that's very sweet of you, Esmeralda, but Aunt Hagatha's baby-sitting for us.
Aw Well, I mean, naturally, we thought of you right away, but Samantha, I know that you're just saying that to make me feel better.
Oh, no!
But the truth is, I know you don't trust me, but I don't blame you, I don't blame you.
So if you don't mind, I'll just say my final goodbyes.
What do you mean goodbye?
Where are you going?
No place.
I'm going to change myself into something useful.
Change yourself?
Into what?
A punching bag.
Hitting a punching bag helps people get rid of their frustrations and it's also good exercise.
So at last I'd be doing something worthwhile.
Esmeralda, you're not making any sense.
I thought she made sense.
Esmeralda, you're overreacting.
You're our favorite baby-sitter.
I am?
Well, of course.
You're always our first choice.
You're wonderful with the children.
Oh, if I thought that was true It's true, it's true.
I'll get it.
Larry, I thought we were to meet you and the Nortons at the restaurant.
So did I, up until 15 minutes ago.
Hi, Sam, Esmeralda.
What happened?
Their regular sitter conked out.
Well, if it's just a matter of a baby-sitter, why don't the Nortons call the agency?
Are you kidding?
A regular, run-of-the-mill baby-sitter for the Nortons?
Oh.
Mr. Norton said to go on to dinner anyway as his guests.
Well, somehow it doesn't seem right to go without the Nortons.
Doesn't seem right to me either.
You know, I was all set to maneuver Norton into signing on the dotted line.
Well, I-if your business dinner is so important I happen to know someone who's very good with children.
Oh?
At least, certain persons think so.
Well, who'd you have in mind?
Shall I tell him, or will you?
Well, I guess I'll tell you.
Me.
You?
Well, I thought you were sitting for Sam and Darrin, aren't you?
Uh-uh.
They had to settle for Samantha's Aunt Hagatha instead.
Well, then, if you're available, we're in.
No, we're not.
I mean, Esmeralda isn't up to Weren't you just telling us how not up to things you felt?
Well, just to know that I'm needed, all of a sudden, I feel much better.
Oh, it's like a miracle.
Then it's all settled.
I'll call the Nortons and tell them we've found the perfect baby-sitter.
And we can keep our dinner date.
Uh, Larry, no.
Uh, er Believe me, it won't work out.
Well, why not?
Esmeralda sits for your kids, doesn't she?
Yes, she's perfect for us, but But what?
But, well But what?
Your kids aren't any different from any other kids.
You wanna bet?
Of course, I won't go into details about the campaign I worked up, but when Darrin lays it out for you Are you positive she's qualified?
Mrs. Norton, your fears are needless.
Sam tell her what a marvelous baby-sitter your aunt is.
Oh, yes, well Aunt Esmeralda is out of this world.
Way, way out.
Martha, I really wish you'd stop worrying about this.
I think the reason Ralph is so sensitive is that you fuss over him too much.
Mrs. Norton, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Matter of fact, your Aunt Esmeralda probably has more to worry about than Ralph.
"And from that time on, "the little prince was never lonely again "because all he had to do was sit down on his wonderful traveling cloak"  Ralph, that arrow came very close.
"on his wonderful traveling cloak "and go sailing off into the sky, soaring over the mountains, and rivers, and villages".
There.
How did you like the story of The Little Lame Prince?
No one can fly with a cloak.
With this one you could.
How come?
Was it jet-propelled?
Better than that.
It was a magic cloak.
What?
What happened?
Just a little magic.
There's no such thing as magic.
If I wanted to, I could show you some magic.
Go ahead.
Well Well, all right.
But you've got to promise not to tell anyone.
Now, then, let me see Oh.
Keep your eye on that lion cub and watch his tail wag.
Thirteen uncles, Eighteen nieces, Wag, oh, wag your tail To pieces.
He didn't wag his tail.
Well, I'll just try something else.
Let me see.
Now, what was that one?
Oh, yes.
Flapjacks and noodles, Hamburgers rare, I want two poodles, And make it a pair.
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness.
I said "pair," not "bear".
Who cares?
Can I keep him?
Oh, no, Ralph.
Your parents wouldn't like it.
Eat a peach, peel a pear, O'Leery and O'Brien, Bear fade and change to air, To prove that I'm not lying.
I did it!
I did it!
Now, Ralphie, it's time for you to go to sleep.
Elliott.
I'm worried about Ralphie.
Oh, Martha, please, don't start that again.
Mrs. Norton, why don't you call home?
I'm sure everything's all right.
Okay, okay, if that'll make you feel better.
Waiter!
Bring us a phone, will you, please?
How do you do all those tricks?
Are you a magician?
No.
I'm a witch.
You are?
Boy, I wish you could sit with me all the time.
That would be nice.
Well, good night, Ralphie.
Night.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Norton.
Yes.
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
Ralphie's just going to sleep now.
Oh, yes, you all have a good time.
Everything's fine.
So I'll see you later.
Bye-bye.
Come in.
Good evening.
Good evening.
How's our little Ralphie?
Oh, I just checked on him.
He's sound asleep with such a peaceful smile on his face.
I can't understand it.
Getting him to sleep has been such a hassle.
How did you manage?
Just a knack.
Excuse me while I get my coat.
A knack!
She has a rare talent.
Darrin, your ideas are very good.
Now, we're meeting tomorrow afternoon  Thank you.
I'll be looking forward to it.
Uh, we'll be saying our good-nights, then.
I'm rather anxious to check on our baby-sitter.
Good night, Mr. Norton, Mrs. Norton.
MRS.
Good night.
Thanks again.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Sam, what are you doing?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Where did he come from?
Yes, Esmeralda, where did he come from?
Oh, mercy.
Well, never mind.
Just tell me what he was, and I'll change him back.
He was a stuffed toy.
I thought you couldn't change Well, I can't change the spell, but I can change that lion cub into a toy lion cub.
Put this over here, where Ralphie will find it in the morning.
Every other baby-sitter just sits.
But not Esmeralda.
Oh, no.
She has to amuse her clients with sloppy, second-rate spells that invariably Everything turned out just fine, Darrin.
So I don't care to discuss it.
Mr. Stephens is absolutely right.
I am just a sloppy, second-rate witch.
Esmeralda, will you forget about that?
And I'd probably turn out to be a sloppy, second-rate punching bag too.
Stop punishing yourself.
The incident is forgotten.
Well, I better put the roast in the oven.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Norton.
What a pleasant surprise.
This is not a social visit.
Oh.
Well, come in, let me fix you a cup of coffee or tea.
Uh-oh.
There.
See what you've done?
What I've done?
It's just a black eye, Mom.
Just a black eye?
Oh, my poor, brave darling.
Mrs. Norton.
I'm very sorry about Ralph's shiner, but how Well, I-I mean, what does that have to do with me?
You recommended your Aunt Esmeralda, didn't you?
Well, yes, I did, but MRS.
And it was your Aunt Esmeralda who filled Ralphie's head with all of those lies about witches and spells.
But she's a good witch.
Shut up, Ralphie!
Mrs. Norton, I don't know what Ralph told you, but Ralphie didn't tell us anything.
He told his classmates all those lies about animals appearing and disappearing.
And having a witch for a baby-sitter.
His classmates made fun of him.
One thing led to another and they started to fight.
Those monsters might have killed my little Ralphie.
Mrs. Norton, I can't tell you how sorry I am.
MRS.
Sorry is not enough.
I came here to tell you that your Aunt Esmeralda is a menace.
My little Ralphie never lied before.
Mrs. Norton, I'm sure I can explain, if you'd just give me chance And don't think that I haven't told Mr. Norton about this outrage.
Oh, I wouldn't think that for a second.
Well I suppose you heard.
Every word.
Of course, you're not gonna let a little thing like that bother you.
Are you letting it bother you?
Yes.
Hello.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Sam, do you know what's happened?
Sweetheart, you're shouting.
I know I'm shouting, but not as loud as Larry was shouting.
Norton called a few minutes ago and canceled our meeting this afternoon.
Yes, I know.
Mrs. Norton was just here.
He told Larry about Esmeralda and her hocus-pocus and he pulled the account.
Sweetheart, Esmeralda didn't mean I know she didn't mean to, but the point is, why can't she keep her magic to herself?
It isn't the magic, it's  Uh, sweetheart, I think you've just said the magic word.
What's that?
Magic.
Hm?
Uh, trust me.
I have some preparing to do, and I better hurry.
Hi.
Hi.
Been shopping?
After you called, I went out and got these simple magic tricks.
VoilÃ .
I'm planning a party for tomorrow.
Why not?
We have a lot to celebrate.
It's for Tabitha and Adam.
And Ralphie.
And Mr. and Mrs. Norton.
And Larry Tate.
Why?
We're having ice cream and cake, and martinis.
And a magic show with Esmeralda as the magician.
It doesn't matter how simple the tricks are.
Esmeralda will goof them up.
Exactly.
And when Esmeralda puts her special brand of magic on top of these very simple magic tricks, it will simply prove to the Nortons that what Ralphie saw was some very convincing magic.
I suppose there's some logic buried in there someplace.
But how do you expect to get the Nortons here?
Well, I'm capable of a little magic myself.
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
Good.
Yes?
Mrs. Stephens?
Oh, well, put her on.
Oh, hi, Sam.
I'm right in the middle of a big conference, so if you could make it brief.
A party for Tabitha?
Well, that's a hard one to turn down.
Mr. Norton will be there.
So tell Tabitha to expect her Uncle Larry.
Bye.
Hello.
What?
Are you ready for this?
It's Mrs. Stephens calling to invite Ralphie to a party.
Good, let me tell her off.
Oh, no, you don't.
This is my pleasure.
Mrs. Stephens.
I'm going to tell you exactly what you can do with your party.
Of course, we'll be there.
Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
Take Ralphie to party at Stephens' this afternoon.
But you just said that you I know what I just said, but we're going.
You too.
What makes you say that?
I don't know what makes me say that.
But you're going.
Oh, hi, Mr. and Mrs. Norton.
Come right in and make yourselves comfortable.
Show's about to start.
There'll be ice cream, and cookies, and favors later.
Goody!
Hi, Ralphie.
Ralphie.
Mrs. Norton, Mr. Norton.
Stop it.
Robert.
It's not nice to punch Tabitha in the stomach.
Where should I punch her?
Tabitha, you trade places with Terry.
All right, here we go.
You all set?
All set.
And remember, I'm on my own.
Oh, yeah, we're counting on that.
For my first mysterious illusion, I will take this ordinary metal triangle and Oh!
Metal hoop!
And, uh, presto!
Oh, rats.
Oh, wait a minute, that's not the trick.
Let's just move on.
Oh, yes.
And now a trick that has baffled and entertained the crowned heads of Europe.
You can see that this is perfectly empty.
And this, there's nothing concealed in this, you see?
All right.
Presto!
Oh!
I'm such a silly goose!
More, more!
More!
That's amazing.
How did she do that?
How do I know?
I don't even know why I'm here.
Why are they applauding?
I goofed.
More!
Now you stop that.
I'll tell you when to applaud.
Get rid of that.
Eat a pickled kumquat, Farewell from a dummy, Enjoyed your stay, But, now, good day, Oh, spell, Be on the money.
Oh I said "money", not "monkey".
She puts on a pretty good show, eh, Martha?
Esmeralda, do something.
Bats in the belfry, Pigs in a poke, Lose that monkey Before I choke.
What happened?
She You were changed to a monkey.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Well, that concludes our show.
Okay, kids, there's ice cream and cake in the dining room.
Okay, now, you follow Tabitha.
Run along.
You too, Adam.
Attaboy.
Esmeralda, you certainly put on a convincing magic act.
How did you do that last illusion?
Believe me, I wish I knew.
What she means is no magician ever reveals the secrets of the trade.
Of course.
Oh, I can't get over it.
I actually saw a monkey.
So did I. And so did all the kids.
But we all know that's impossible, don't we, Mrs. Norton?
You know, I almost felt like a monkey.
Would you believe that?
Well, you should've believed Ralphie.
Can you ever forgive me for all those things I said about your Aunt Esmeralda?
Now that I can see the kind of tricks she can do, I don't blame Ralphie for believing in witchcraft.
Well Aunt Esmeralda is no ordinary person.
Believe me.
Oh, my.
That was the nicest farewell party I ever had.
But, now, it's time to go.
Well, we're gonna miss you.
Yes, things certainly won't be the same with you gone.
Well, thank you, Mr. Stephens.
After my big success as a magician, oh, I'm so sure of myself.
I mean, I know where I'm going.
Wonderful.
Have a nice trip.
Thank you.
And come back soon.
How about that?
A new Esmeralda.
Secure, serene, knows exactly where she's going.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
I guess I took a wrong turn.
I'm sorry.
Esmeralda, you have nothing to be sorry about.
And now you can settle something I've always wondered about.
Does the light really go out when the door closes?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Good morning.
Morning, sweetheart.
Where are the kids?
Uh, Esmeralda took them to the park for the day.
Hm.
Sam, you have finally achieved the ultimate in housewifery.
I've fixed scrambled eggs before.
No, no, no.
I mean volunteering for.
Mrs. Prescott's charity bazaar and fashion show.
Oh, that.
Getting next to the client's wife is very important in the business world.
I know, I just hope I have enough energy to make it.
I have an acute case of the blahs.
You're not trying to back out, are you?
Well.
The power of positive thinking.
I feel wonderful.
In fact, I have never felt better.
Oh, dear.
Slow and steady wins the race.
Sam, if you're not kidding, say so.
So.
Well, what's wrong?
I don't know.
I felt it coming on last night.
It's as if I can't move my legs or my arms.
And it's getting worse.
Oh, dear.
See what I mean?
Well, maybe you better lie down in the living room for a while.
Oh.
Good idea.
Oh!
Uh H?
How?
How about if you brought?
Brought the couch in here?
Uh, well, here, I'll carry you in.
Oh, now, sweetheart, be careful.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.
Sam.
What happened?
You feel like you weigh a ton.
I don't know.
But I think I'd better call Dr. Bombay for some help.
The trouble is every time Dr. Bombay helps us, we end up needing more help.
Help!
Dr. Bombay, help!
Dr. Bombay.
Calling Dr. Bombay.
Emergency.
Come right away.
I hope you realize you interrupted me just as I was about to deliver quintuplets.
You dress like that for a maternity case?
What maternity case?
I was delivering them to my apartment for a little nightcap.
What seems to be the matter?
Try and lift me.
Those naughty quintuplets have sapped my strength.
Now give me a hand.
There's a good fellow.
Are you getting the message?
Not yet.
Now I get it.
They don't build houses the way they used to.
Oh, well.
Your floor needs a bit of strengthening.
Weebus warbus, tootle flick.
Shore this floor and do it quick.
There, now you have a proper floor.
Up she goes.
It doesn't work.
Of course not.
It needs a penny.
This is ridiculous.
Well, somebody has to pay for our pension plan.
Sam, you weigh over 500 pounds.
But, sweetheart, that's with all my clothes on.
Yeah, but 500 pounds?
I suggest she cut out starches.
I suggest you cut out the corny jokes.
What's wrong with her?
Actually, it has nothing to do with weight.
It has to do with the gravitational pull, and it fluctuates with the tide.
It's a condition peculiar to witches and warlocks known as gravititis inflamitis.
As you know Samantha, a witch's normal response to the force of gravity is simply to thumb her nose at it.
That's why witches are able to fly.
But, Samantha, living in this, uh, stultified mortal atmosphere has sublimated her natural instincts.
Would you care to repeat that?
Not particularly.
Dr. Bombay, are you sure that's what this is?
Are you disputing the word of an expert?
Uh, no, but if-if you wouldn't mind we would like another opinion.
Oh, very well, Samantha, since it's you.
Meet Dr. Calm Pewter.
A little medical joke.
Very little.
Now, sit the patient down, Durbin.
Come on, Sam.
One in each hand.
I'm feeding it the information it needs to know.
That should do it.
What is it, what does it say?
Not a good day for romance.
Someone near you needs a haircut.
Lucky number: Seven.
Hm.
I'm merely trying to lighten the atmosphere.
Actually, it confirms my original diagnosis, gravititis inflamitis.
Well, what can you do about it?
Fortunately, everything.
There we are.
Martini mix, lime juice, instant Manhattan.
Ah, here we are.
Little antidote, little incantation, and you'll be as good as new.
You will drink while I incant.
Get ready, on your mark.
Go.
Ear of corn, tooth of comb.
Drive your healing powers home.
And with heart of artichoke, make all this a passing joke.
It's done.
Feeling any better, my dear?
Uh I think so.
I think I am.
I think I am.
I really think I am.
Forgive me for doubting you, Dr. Bombay.
You are indeed an expert.
Yes, well, all these exertions have made me a little thirsty, so I I-I-I-I-I You quack.
You certainly know how to hurt an expert.
Well, what do we do now?
I have a previous engagement but I might suggest you take her out to the park and fly her like a kite.
Dr. Bombay, I am not amused.
Dr. Bombay, do something.
I have already done something.
I've cured you.
Not wisely, but too well.
Isn't there an antidote for the antidote?
I'll have the apothecary whip something up but first I must call on my houseguests.
Uh, the quintuplets can wait.
But I can't.
Dr. Bombay, before you leave, uh, won't you fix the floor?
I might have trouble with the carpenters' union.
We won't fink.
Well, in that case.
Thank you.
My pleasure.
By your leave.
Sam, what are we gonna do?
No, Sam.
Well, the, uh, first thing we should do is call Mrs. Prescott and tell her that I've come down Or up w-with something.
Yoo-Hoo.
Yoo-Hoo.
Hello.
Ah, Mrs. Prescott.
Where are the curtains?
Cleaner's.
Great.
Let's go.
Can't just stand here grinning at her.
Get me over to the door.
Hang on.
Hello.
Hi, Mrs. Prescott.
Well, what brings you here?
Oh, well, I've come to pick up Mrs. Stephens.
Aren't you a little early, Mrs. Prescott?
Oh, I know my business, Mrs. Stephens.
Volunteers have a habit of going AWOL at the last minute.
That's why I never rely on chance and I pick them up personally.
Now, on the double.
The other ladies are waiting in the station wagon.
Coming, ladies.
We'll be right there.
Ah.
Well, the fact is, Mrs. Prescott, I'm afraid my wife can't make it just yet.
Oh.
Sweetheart?
Mm?
Why?
Why don't you come with me?
Right.
Where she goes, I go.
He just loves bazaars.
And we just love being together.
But I thought you were playing golf with Mr. Prescott.
Well, I changed my mind.
Four hours on a golf course away from Sam is more than I can stand.
Oh How long have you two been married?
Not long enough.
Oh, you're a rare man, Mr. Stephens.
Well, I have a rare wife.
Makes me want to cry.
Shall we go?
Oh, I'm glad you got here on time, Roberta.
Are you sure you'll be comfortable here with all these women, Mr. Stephens?
Hello, dear.
Oh, What women, Mrs. Prescott?
When I'm with my wife, there are no other women.
MRS.
Oh, that's sheer poetry.
Now, here you are, Mrs. Stephens.
Now, my dear, all the prices are clearly marked and they've been discounted up to 70 percent so there'll be no bargaining.
Mr. Stephens, really.
I can't help it.
I really dig this chick.
Well, I'll be about my business.
The fashion show will begin in about half an hour.
Oh.
Darrin, are you taking something for that cold?
At a time like this the common cold is hardly anything to worry about.
Only when you sneeze.
Uh, hand me that bolt of material.
Well, that ought to keep me anchored.
Now, you grab a cab and go home.
See if Dr. Bombay's come up with that antidote.
Okay.
And do something about that cold.
Oh, that looks lovely.
Oh, thank you.
I, uh, picked it up at a little boutique.
I mean the material you're holding in your lap.
Oh, that.
It's just an ugly old print.
Uh, may I see it?
Uh, may I look at it more closely?
What for?
You're not gonna buy it, it's a second.
It looks all right to me.
I'll take it.
One yard?
The whole bolt.
What are you gonna do with a whole bolt of this threadbare junk?
How much is it?
Well, uh.
It's It's marked $50.
But to tell you the truth, I'm so crazy about it I'm gonna buy it for 75.
I don't understand.
Madam, this is a charity affair, and if I Mrs. Prescott, is this or is this not a legitimate sale?
Oh, of course it is, Mrs. Brock.
Then why are you resorting to shills as though this were a Turkish bazaar?
I beg your pardon?
That bolt of material is clearly marked $50 and she's offering 75.
Now, is this a charity bazaar, or is this an auction?
I It's a charity bazaar auction.
I bid 75, do I hear 80?
Mrs. Stephens, please.
Okay.
Sold to the lady for $50.
Thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me.
My dear, you must excuse her, she's new.
Uh, can I carry it to your car, Mrs. Brock?
That won't be necessary, I can manage.
Where did she go?
Oh, Mrs. Prescott, have you seen Samantha?
No one has.
She's disappeared into thin air.
These novice volunteers are always a problem.
Ah, would you excuse me please?
I must find someone to replace her at this booth.
Uh, uh  Sam.
Sam?
Psst.
Where?
Up here.
W?
How did you?
How did you get up there?
You are kidding.
Sorry.
Is Dr. Bombay back?
No.
I'll climb up and help you down.
Helen, I do appreciate this.
I'm sure Mrs. Stephens will turn up Hello, there.
Turn up eventually, but I  Excuse me.
What are you two doing up in that tree?
We're bird watching.
There's some very rare birds up here.
I can see that.
Mrs. Stephens, will you please come down from there?
The fashion show starts in five minutes.
We can watch it from up here.
You are in it, Mrs. Stephens.
Can't you get somebody else?
Not for her costume.
Oh, you can both climb trees after the fashion show.
Stephens?
What the devil are you doing up there?
Well, Mr. Prescott, fancy seeing you here.
Fancy seeing you there.
I was expecting you to pick me up for our golf game.
An hour ago.
Oh, I'm sorry about that, uh, something came up and, uh, well, I forgot all about it.
How'd you like to forget about my account?
Ah, I wouldn't want to do that.
By the way, this is my wife.
Samantha, Mr. Prescott, the Shoe King.
How do you do?
Uh, we may be handling his advertising.
Oh.
If you're a typical.
McMann-Tate account executive, I doubt it very much.
There goes $200,000 in billings.
Not necessarily.
Help me down.
Sam, you can't be serious.
You're not thinking of trying to model?
Yes, and saving the account at the same time.
You're not only light on your feet, you're light in the head.
I know what I'm doing.
Now help me down and over to that dressing room and I'll explain.
Okay, Sam, come on down.
Oh.
That's a pretty squirrelly couple.
It's called love, Wilbur.
Why is he holding her like that?
That is also called love, Wilbur.
He's gonna help her dress?
Love, Wilbur.
Sick, Selma.
What's going on in there?
I'd rather not know.
And now from Madame Pergine.
"This smart Chinese red chiffon "with accordion pleated sleeves and skirt, "flattering wide belt, and the new mini length.
"An afternoon dress that can go on into evening "by removing the scarf and adding jewels and accessories".
You prefer this nonsense to a game of golf?
You're in for a big surprise, Mr. Prescott.
Actually, this is a dress rehearsal of an advertising concept for Prescott Shoes.
Oh?
Sam's helping.
If it worked, I was gonna spring it on you Monday.
But seeing that you're here.
Thanks to you.
Thank you, Mrs. Langley.
And now for the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance of the afternoon Um, Mrs. Prescott, is Samantha up next?
Y Yes.
Well, then, do you mind if I take over the description?
Mr. Stephens, you are hardly qualified.
Oh, no, Sam filled me in.
And it's a surprise for Mr. Prescott.
Very well.
Ah, ladies and gentlemen the highlight of the afternoon is dedicated to the Prescott Shoe Company, without whose generous support this bazaar would not have come to being.
"From the House of Lautrec, we present Pharaoh Land "inspired by the slave girls of ancient Egypt.
"And notice how the slave girl walks, "her feet hardly touching the ground.
"How does she carry that heavy brass urn "from the well to her master's bath with such ease?
"Uh, the secret?
Prescott Shoes.
"The message: "No woman need be a slave to household drudgery because with Prescott Shoes, you don't walk, you float".
You don't walk, you float.
You don't walk, you float.
Are you all right?
Oh, fine.
Stephens, how'd you do it?
Invisible wires.
I didn't see any invisible wires.
If you saw them, they wouldn't be invisible.
You hang on to me.
This isn't gonna be easy, but let's give it a try.
Ouch.
Uh, Sam, do you mind?
Oh, of course not, sweetheart.
Oh.
Where is that quack Bombay?
One more libelous statement like that and he won't be here.
What took you so long?
I never kiss and tell.
Dr. Bombay, do you have the antidote for the antidote?
Come and get it.
MR.
Hello, there.
Bombay, do something.
I'll take care of it.
Answer the door.
Did I see what I thought I saw?
She was floating four feet off the floor.
No, she was standing on a ladder four feet off the floor.
Unhooking the invisible wires.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
That's all right, darling.
Oh, uh, Mr. Prescott, this is our family doctor, Dr. Bombay.
Doctor, is that natural?
They've been at it all day.
Under the circumstances, absolutely essential.
Dr. Bombay, all this activity is giving me a headache.
Is there something you could recommend?
I have just the thing for your condition.
Thank you.
Uh, Stephens, I'm sorry about barging in like this but I can't get that slogan out of my mind.
You know, "With Prescott Shoes, you don't walk, you float".
Is it going away?
Will you listen to me, Stephens?
I, uh I think you can let go of me now, sweetheart.
Let her go and listen to me.
Sam, that's just great.
Can I fix you a drink, Mr. Prescott?
Yes, thank you.
And then let's talk shoes.
I want to see that floating bit again.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, but I took the invisible wires off.
And put them on Dr. Bombay.
Oh, those naughty little quintuplets have taken more out of me than I thought.
Here goes.
Hah-hah.
We just wanted to test the invisible wires to see if the campaign for the men's shoes would work as well.
Incredible.
At least.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
Yeah.
Yeah, he's ready.
You want to talk to him?
You're kidding.
Yeah, sure, I'll tell him.
Bye-bye.
That was Larry.
He and Mr. Woolcott will be over to pick you up in a few minutes and guess what?
What?
In Mr. Woolcott's helicopter.
You're kidding.
That's what I said.
Well, I guess if you're stuck being one of the 10 richest men in the world, you might as well live like it.
Where are you going?
He wants to show us the site of the newest in the chain of Woolcott Towers.
There's a chance we may be handling the advertising for all his hotels.
Wow.
Well, he said they'd be right over, but this is ridiculous.
Serena.
Hi, coz.
Serena, since when do you use a doorbell?
Or for that matter, a door?
Since when is it good manners not to say hello?
Since Hello, Serena.
And what are you doing here?
When you're exiled, you have to go someplace.
What do you mean "exiled"?
Oh, I forgot.
I told the cab driver you'd pay the fare, Sammy.
Cab driver?
That's right.
Sweetheart, why don't you pay the cab driver and I'll find out what's going on.
Come on, Serena.
What do you mean "exiled"?
Contessa Pirhana blew her cool.
Uh-oh.
Yeah.
How was I supposed to know that Otto was her fiancÃ©?
What did Pirhana do?
The old bat took me by surprise and zapped away all my powers.
How'd you get here?
She zapped me onto the freeway.
It was humiliating and suffocating.
How can you stand all that smog?
Serena, why don't you settle in Switzerland?
They don't have a smog problem.
Darrin, this is serious.
Serena's lost her powers.
You bet it's serious.
She can't stay here.
Sweetheart, where is your compassion?
We can't throw her out.
I mean, if she's without her powers, she's going to need some mortal basic training.
Then let's ship her off to Fort Bragg.
Sam, powers or no powers, if she stays here, we're living in a potential disaster area.
Oh, that must be Larry and Mr. Woolcott.
Sam, anyplace but here.
Wow.
Who's that cat?
Not bad-looking.
Must be rich, huh?
Forget it, Serena.
Oh, but, cousin.
If my witchcraft is temporarily zonked, what better substitute than rich-craft?
I mean, there's not much difference between witchcraft and rich-craft.
Except maybe you fly a little slower.
But Sammy, it would just be a little harmless research on mortal men.
Serena, you picked the wrong guinea pig.
Mr. Woolcott is strictly business.
But, coz, if Durwood is going to temporarily support me, the least I can do is take an interest in his business.
Serena, you may stay with us as long as you promise to stay out of Darrin's way.
That will be my pleasure.
Mommy, Adam's eating my crayons.
Little darling.
How did a nice little witch like me get into a mess like this?
"Woolcott Towers, above the rest".
"Woolcott Towers, above the rest".
Sounds good, Darrin.
Yeah, come on in.
Harrison, would you like a drink before we start?
Yeah, good idea.
Hi, beautiful people.
You too, dumbo.
Dumbo?
It's a nickname.
A term of endearment.
If you say so.
Hi, cotton-top.
Hi, Serena.
And who be you?
Serena, may I present Harrison Woolcott?
Harrison, Serena is Sam's Younger cousin.
Serena.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Serena, why don't you go upstairs?
Say!
I'll bet you're Harrison Woolcott of the Woolcott Towers, right, Mr. Woolcott?
May I call you Harrison?
Whatever you call me, I'll be sure to answer.
Terrific.
Now, you just put your little self right down there.
You know, the Woolcott Towers have always been my home away from home.
Oh, groovy.
Oh, yeah.
New York, Tokyo, Istanbul.
But my favorite is in San Francisco.
San Francisco?
Uh-huh.
Well, I'm afraid you're a little young for that hotel.
I'm not too young for any hotel.
Yes, but you see, that burned down 50 years ago.
Huh?
She means her mommy used to stay there.
Uh, Harrison, I'd like you to meet my wife, Samantha.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Let's go.
Well, you see, they were Well, I guess you'd like to go over the ad concepts now.
You guess wrong.
You always travel with your husband?
Never with my husband.
She means she's never been married.
Yes.
She never settles down long enough to meet anyone.
It's go, go, go.
Speaking of go, I better get Serena to the airport before she misses her plane for Switzerland.
She's not gonna miss anything.
Darrin, don't let her go to Switzerland.
I can't talk her out of it.
Can anyone try?
Try, dumbo.
Uh, Sam, I think we need some ice for the drinks.
Excuse us.
Excuse us.
Sam, do you realize what's going on in there?
Yes.
She's flirting like any normal girl.
A, she is not a normal girl, B, what she's flirting with is my future.
If she gets involved with Woolcott, it's bound to end up a catastrophe.
Now, I am not running a home for delinquent witches.
I want Serena out of this house.
I'm glad you feel that way, dumbo, because Harrison has asked me to go boating with him this afternoon.
I think I can discourage him.
I doubt it.
Oh, oh, Sammy.
Oh, he is charming.
Spelled R-I-C-H.
Don't hassle me, Sammy.
Now, this is the main salon.
Or saloon, as you prefer.
I think "saloon" is less pretentious and more fun, don't you?
Oh, what lovely paintings.
Thank you.
Picasso, Matisse  Cute.
"Cute".
That's an odd thing to say about van Gogh.
Maybe Irving Van Gogh, not Vincent.
Are you saying this is a copy?
Isn't it?
I asked you first.
Of course it's a copy.
And so are these.
Didn't you know?
Yes, I know.
Oh, how clever of you to hang copies.
The salt air would have ruined the original canvasses, which I hope you have.
Yes, I have.
You know what's extraordinary, is nobody else ever suspected.
How did you know?
Well, take the van Gogh, for instance.
Mm-hm.
Look at those brushstrokes.
Vincent never caressed a canvas.
He attacked it.
Oh, he was an angry young man, I can tell you.
Sounds like you speak from personal experience.
Oh, you can't get more personal.
What?
I I I mean I did my thesis on van Gogh.
I really immersed myself in his life.
Here, let me.
Oh, thank you.
I'm not very bright about some things.
Only about the things that matter, eh?
Mm.
Yummy.
Mm.
ChÃ¢teau Margaux 1957.
I don't think so.
My guess would be ChÃ¢teau Lafite Rothschild '45.
Well, what's the difference so long as it's fermented?
Now, this Margaux Yes, it is Lafite '45.
That's amazing because the captain said he was gonna serve Margaux.
Just for that I'll have to bust him to corporal.
Oh!
Yes?
The cook would like to see you in the galley, sir.
It must be about lunch.
Don't go away.
Not I. "Close cover before striking".
What are you doing?
Well, I I was trying to light a match.
Now, either I'm not striking them hard enough, or the matches are faulty.
You are one of the most delightfully helpless creatures I've ever met in my life.
About some things, Harry.
Only about some things.
Now, let's talk about you.
Is it true that you are one of the 10 richest men in the world?
Well, that was a matter of timing.
What do you mean?
Well, at the time I was born my father happened to be one of the 10 richest men in the world.
Oh!
Where did you get your education?
At Witches U. Witches U?
Oh.
That's my nickname for Vassar.
We had a witch for a dean.
Serena, you're a remarkable girl.
You know, I feel that the chemistry between us is very good.
And the biology isn't bad, either.
I am going to kill her, Sam.
I'm going to kill her and no jury on Earth will convict me.
They were only gone three days.
And I'm thinking.
And I'm thinking.
She's up there right now, getting dressed to meet him for lunch.
That'll probably be another three days.
And what I'm thinking is when Harrison meets Serena for lunch, it won't be Serena he meets.
Who will it be?
Me.
I'm gonna to take advantage of Serena's delicate condition and put her in the deep freeze until after lunch.
Whatever Serena turned on, I am gonna turn off.
Don't tell me another thing.
I love it, and I've got to get to the office.
Mm, thank you.
Hi, I ordered you a martini.
Oh, thank you.
Well.
You look more beautiful than the last time I saw you.
You just saw me two hours ago.
Well, it seems more like two weeks.
Harrison Mm.
There's something I have to say to you.
Well, before you do, are you interested in buried treasure?
Wh?
What?
Look under your napkin.
Go on.
Open it.
You have got to be kidding.
Well, Tiffany's was pretty serious about it.
They closed up for the rest of the week.
Uh, look, buster, we had a nice little cruise together, but don't hang anything permanent on me.
I've heard of schizophrenia, but this is ridiculous.
What happened to you?
Well, I was under a spell on the yacht.
The full moon reflecting on the water.
The balmy breezes blowing.
The stars in the sky.
There was no moon.
It was foggy.
And as for the balmy breezes, we were in a squall most of the time.
Well, you've guessed my problem.
I have these hallucinations.
I don't believe this.
Well, you better believe it.
And I have another problem.
A psychotic fear of money.
When I handle it, I break out in hives.
Well, you don't have to handle it.
We'll let the help do that.
Harrison, to put this as nicely as I know how, you and I, we're two ships that passed in the night.
We tooted our whistles at each other.
Now we must sail on.
Uh, waiter?
Yes, sir.
I'd like another drink, a double, please, and one for the young lady.
What lady?
How about a cup of black coffee instead?
Yes, it's a very good idea.
She is the most remarkable bundle of delightful contradictions that I have ever known.
This is a girl who can't unscrew the top on a bottle of olives yet can read the stars like Galileo.
She can't dial a telephone but she can tell you what went on in the bedroom of Alexander Graham Bell in 1902.
Now, that's heavy.
Well, doesn't that prove she's kind of strange?
Sure, it's strange, but it's like an exciting strange.
Oh, exciting.
Definitely exciting.
You know another thing that fascinates me?
She doesn't care about my loot.
They don't make girls like that anymore.
On the other hand, just to turn you down because you're wealthy is a kind of reverse prejudice.
And you wouldn't want to have anything to do with a bigot.
Stephens, I don't want to hear about your hang-ups with your wife's cousin.
I don't want to hear that.
That's between you and your psychiatrist.
I want to hear you say, "Harrison, let's go back to my house and see if we can talk some sense into Serena".
That's what I want to hear you say.
Say it, Darrin.
Say it.
All right, I'll say it.
Harrison, why don't we all go back to Darrin's house and see if we can talk some sense into Serena?
That's the way to say it.
Come on.
Compass point east And west and north.
I beg the Contessa Pirhana Come forth.
You begged.
Sit down, Contessa.
No, thank you.
Aunt Hepzibah taught me that sitting was a sign of weakness.
Contessa, it is unbecoming to hold a grudge.
Yes, but so satisfying.
How many fiancÃ©s do you have?
The usual, of course.
One.
Two.
Three.
Including Otto?
Yes, I gave him another chance.
Okay.
Then why not give her another chance too?
Is she sufficiently remorseful?
Oh, she's a real pussycat.
Aren't you, Serena?
Yes.
And one of these days you are going to be my mouse.
As for you  Oh, Harrison.
Hi, Darrin, Larry.
Sam.
Come in, there's somebody I'd like you to meet.
Darrin, Mr. Tate, Mr. Woolcott, this is the Contessa Pirhana.
How do, Contessa?
I'm happy to know you.
Did I say happy?
I meant enchanted.
Okay, okay, you've met her.
Now, buzz off, Pirhana.
I don't need you anymore.
I have found my true love.
Excuse me, I have to ask the Contessa something.
Would it be presumptuous of me to ask what you're doing in the immediate future?
Like tonight?
Now Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
There's something freaky going on here.
I'm having dinner with you.
Followed by an evening of dancing, merry-making, et cetera.
Et cetera!
Et cetera?
When do you pick me up?
I just did.
Oh Why don't we start the evening this afternoon?
Oh, now, wait a minute, Harrison.
Mr. Woolcott, please.
Serena, the Contessa and I have to have a talk.
Alone.
Come along.
But But You too.
Okay.
Which wise witch pulled this stunt?
Well, don't look at me.
I gave up love spells in high school.
I'm taking the fifth.
He's attractive, isn't he?
You had your revenge, Pirhana.
So before you embark on your night of dancing, merry-making, et cetera, undo your thing.
Party pooper.
All right.
Repeat after me.
I am sorry, Contessa.
I'm sorry, Contessa.
Smile witch, laugh witch Take your powers back, witch.
There.
It's been really fun.
Harrison, that's a brilliant idea.
Harrison, we have so much to look forward to.
Let's not waste one moment.
I'm hip.
Let's go.
But we've got business to discuss.
Harrison, we would like a This is business too, you know.
Would you drop me at my place?
I'll get you a cab.
Sam.
Now we're right back in the same mess.
Well, it was the only way I could get Pirhana to take the spell off Serena.
Yeah.
I guess anything's worth getting rid of her.
Ha, ha.
Thanks a lot, superfink.
Sam.
Well    Well, Mr. Woolcott.
Hi.
Come in.
Thank you.
How are you?
I'm all right.
I'm a little weary.
Yes, I can see that.
Hi, Harrison.
Hi, Darrin, how are you?
I went over your layouts and they're super.
Oh, thank you.
We got a deal.
We'll work out the details when I get back, okay?
Get back?
Yeah, I'm gonna put out on the boat for a couple of months.
Rest up.
By the way, if you should see Pirhana again, will you tell her I'm sorry that I freaked out?
Freaked out?
Yeah, well, the other night when I took her out we made the rounds, you know, all the clubs.
And I guess maybe I had a little too much to drink.
Let's face it, I was stoned out of my gourd.
What happened?
Well, we were dancing cheek-to-cheek.
It was nice, romantic, music was playing softly and I was singing in her ear.
Fly me to the moon The next thing I knew, I was on my way.
Where?
To the moon.
Well, that must have been some nightmare.
It was some kind of heavy trip, whatever it was.
Well, I'd better split.
Shh.
Just shh.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Needs more salt.
That's enough.
Does it need pepper too?
Mother, you may be the salt of the earth, but I wish you wouldn't do that.
I can season my stew without your help.
Well, I was just trying to make things easier.
No point in working yourself into a stew.
Stew.
Oh, Samantha, you've lost your sense of humor.
Hi, honey, I'm home.
And I'm not surprised, living with that drudge.
Sam, what a wonderful surprise.
Your mother's here.
And I might have a surprise for you.
How would you like to be a carrot growing in a field of rabbits?
Mother.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.
Oh, hi, Grandmama.
Guess what.
We give up.
I'm invited to a party.
Terrific.
Whose?
Janice London's.
She lives down the street.
Her birthday is a week from Saturday and I'm invited to go ice skating with a bunch of other girls.
Now just calm down, Tabitha.
There's one thing you've forgotten.
What's that?
You don't know how to ice skate.
Tabitha can't ice skate?
Uh Honey, why don't you get cleaned up for dinner and Daddy and I will talk about it, okay?
Okay.
Samantha, it's disgraceful that Tabitha can't ice skate.
Well I remember when you took your first lesson.
You were 3 years old.
It was a morning lesson.
And that same afternoon you qualified for the cosmic Ice Capades.
Blabbermouth.
And she learned by witchcraft.
How terribly clever of you to figure that out.
Well, Tabitha is going to learn to skate the mortal way.
I haven't skated since then, so I'm probably a little rusty, but if you would like me to, I will personally teach Tabitha.
I wouldn't like you to.
If anyone is gonna teach my child how to ice skate it'll be a mortal instructor on a mortal skating rink, the mortal way.
You're in a mortal rut.
Samantha.
The prospect of my granddaughter floundering on the ice with them has given me a splitting migraine.
And now that you've made a perfectly marvelous person sick, she's leaving.
Sam, when you take Tabitha for her lesson, I want a promise.
During the lesson, neither student will use witchcraft.
Well, of course not.
We want Tabitha to What do you mean, "neither student"?
Can you learn to skate normally?
From scratch, without witchcraft?
Why would I wanna do that?
Could you or couldn't you?
Darrin, why is it you think that witches need witchcraft for everything?
Not everything, just everything difficult.
Well!
Can you learn to skate the mortal way?
Are you challenging me?
Yes.
I accept.
And if I can't, I will be more careful in the future about accepting challenges.
Hold on, Mrs. Stephens.
Now, don't be afraid to hold on.
I'm not, I'm not.
By the way, is there a Mr. Stephens?
Yeah.
Then I guess it would be foolish to ask for a date.
I guess so.
Hold your ankles straight.
I'm trying.
Mommy, I'm getting tired.
Yes, sweetheart, I know.
This is tough on both of us, but Come on over here.
Sit over there and rest.
Good idea.
Me too.
Whoa!
Ah!
Help!
Put me down.
Hello, precious.
Hello, Grandmama.
Oh, what a dismal place.
The least your mother could do is take you to the Swiss Alps.
How is it going, sweetheart?
Terrible.
I'll be the worst skater at Janice's party.
Oh, will that upset you?
Yes, all the other kids will laugh at me.
Oh, indeed they will not.
Your grandmama on your good side will not permit it.
Will you put me down?
If you don't mind my saying so, you're some looker.
Most housewives who come down here look like they should be on brooms instead of skates.
Well, that's cute.
Yeah, they're regular witches.
You know what I mean?
Right on, granny.
Your mama's a showoff.
Well, here I go again.
Well, careful now.
Be careful.
No flesh of my flesh Shall be flawed.
To the skating world.
A star is born Tabitha.
Tabitha.
It's a It's a miracle.
You're right.
But whose?
Lady, you've been putting me on, right?
Trying to make me think she's a beginner?
No, not at all.
She's just, uh, a very fast learner.
That child is a virtuoso on ice.
She just picked it up as if by magic.
Now that she knows how to skate, I think I'll take her home.
Let's see that again.
Tabitha, stop that.
Tabitha.
In spite of your grandmama, your mother orders you to stop.
Holy Hans Brinker.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Hi, honey.
Hi, Daddy.
Tabitha.
Adam give you any trouble?
Not a bit.
He's upstairs playing in the nursery.
How'd the ice skating go?
Fine.
Lots of fun.
We both kept our promises.
Good.
I'm proud of you.
Who did better?
You or Tabitha?
Well, um, we started out equally.
Equally bad, that is.
But at the end, Tabitha was terrific.
I think I'll go upstairs and play with Adam.
Sam, this was a big day.
We hoped Tabitha would learn an important lesson and she did.
In here.
Mm.
Ow!
What's the matter?
I learned my important lesson someplace else.
News bulletin.
Two children fast asleep.
Darrin?
Uh, honey, I'm trying to read.
Is the book very interesting?
Very.
Oh.
Well, would you mind putting it down, anyway?
I'd like to talk to you.
What's up?
Two consciences, Tabitha's and mine.
We talked it over and we agreed that honesty is the best policy, right?
Right.
Well, here goes.
Uh, today at the skating rink  Saved by the bell.
Mr. and Mrs. Stephens?
Yes?
I'm Billy Blades Bookoltzer.
Who?
Don't you recognize my name?
No, I'm afraid we don't.
Billy Blades Bookoltzer.
The dean of American figure skating.
Winner of 11 national and international championships, five Olympic medals, two introductions from the studio audience by Ed Sullivan.
May I come in?
What for?
Madam, with my credentials, I should think you at least owe me the chance to be heard.
About what?
Please, be seated.
Thank you.
A few hours ago, I received a phone call from the young man who gave your daughter her first skating lesson.
To tell you she's a prospect for the Olympics?
Correct.
It is?
I hoped I was kidding.
I get these tips from all over the country.
Usually from crackpots.
But since I happen to live nearby, I decided to check this one out.
Well, Mr. Bookoltzer, you have just heard from another crackpot.
Tabitha's only skated one day in her life.
I was informed that your daughter may be the greatest figure skater since me.
Gee, I wonder how she got that good that fast.
Uh, Mr. Bookoltzer, Tabitha is just a beginner.
Mrs. Stephens, the judgment of how good she is must be made by an expert.
I am that expert.
You bring your daughter to the same rink tomorrow morning at 10:00 before it opens to the public, and I shall grant a private audition.
If my information is right, we have an Olympic Games prospect.
But But But Mr. Bookoltzer, we're not interested in our daughter skating in the Olympics.
If I see that she's championship material, I shall become her personal coach.
We can settle my fee later.
Your fee will be nothing.
Yes, you see, this year we're a little strapped, so I'm Payment may be deferred.
Blades Bookoltzer doesn't care about money.
He cares about the art of figure skating.
He cares about winning the Olympics.
He cares about honor and glory, not for himself nor any individual.
For the United States of America.
Uh, well, Mr. Bookoltzer, thanks anyway, but we pass.
Pass?
Pass, pass, you can't pass.
You can't shut the door on patriotism.
If your child possesses this natural talent, to suppress it would be treason.
Uh, Mr. Bookoltzer, Tabitha's natural talent is not ice skating.
I shall determine that tomorrow.
You have her there tomorrow at 10:00 sharp or I shall never let up on you.
If she's not there, I will haunt this very threshold.
I will follow you wherever you may go, track you down no matter what the cost may be.
I shall never surrender.
Okay, Sam, what happened?
You want the truth?
Yes, the whole truth.
You make a guess, I'll bet you get it.
Your mother.
You got it.
Oh, hi, Mommy.
Are we the first ones up?
No, no, that honor went to your brother at 6:00.
But I got him back to sleep at 7:30.
Why are we eating in the dining room?
Well, I, um I thought we'd make a big deal out of breakfast.
Why?
For diplomatic reasons.
And to put your father in a good mood.
Is he mad at us?
No, sweetheart, he isn't mad at you.
He's a tiny bit mad at me.
And a large bit mad at Grandmama.
And when he sees this fancy breakfast, he'll be all smiles.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Good morning, Daddy.
Good morning.
Well, for Sunday breakfast, you have your choice of First, I want to check the sports section.
Pancakes, waffles Maybe Tabitha's in it.
French toast, Spanish omelet Ah.
Here it is.
"Seven-year-old beginner is poetry on ice".
or eggs Benedict.
Oh, come on.
How could that get in the paper?
Did it?
Not yet.
Sam, the table is beautiful, and I know you went to a lot of trouble.
Oh, it was nothing.
And it's not going to do any good.
Daddy, can I still go to Janice London's party?
No.
Uh, yes.
I don't know.
Tabitha, why don't you get your daddy's orange juice?
Okay.
Sweetheart, you can't punish her for something that was beyond her control.
I agree with you, but who knows what else is beyond her control.
Mother's had her kicks.
The spell is off.
And I think we should keep our appointment with Blades.
Why?
Because he won't give up until we convince him that Tabitha is not a candidate for the Olympics.
And that it's his patriotic duty to forget the whole thing.
Maybe he forgot it already.
Maybe last night we discouraged him.
Hello?
Hello.
Billy Blades Bookoltzer here.
Oh, hello, Blades.
I'm calling to remind you of your daughter's audition.
He didn't forget.
What shall I tell him?
Tell him that That Tell him we'll be there.
Blades, we'll see you at the rink.
I'll be there.
Tabitha's star is about to be eclipsed.
These are rented skates, and she doesn't have her own costume, but I think Blades will take that into account.
Okay.
Warm up a little, princess.
What happened?
Oh, well, you remember yesterday.
She's a slow warmer-upper.
I see my spell needs a booster shot.
Now that's more like it.
I'll go get Blades.
Your mother, the Wicked Witch of the West, strikes again.
Mother, where are you?
Mother!
You come over here.
Samantha?
You called?
Endora, knock off that spell or I'll I haven't put a spell on Tabitha.
Not completely.
No, just on her feet.
Endora, if you don't Darrin, this is an occasion that calls for unique handling.
Mother.
What, dear?
We beg you, out of love, please, take that spell off Tabitha.
Mother.
What?
Tabitha's life is about to be taken over by the dean of American figure skating.
He's talking about the Olympic Games.
If she wins the Olympics  And with all that activity, she'll have very little time for her family.
Especially her dear grandmama.
Oh, well.
Oh.
Tabitha To spare you From that mortal fate.
By the blue cosmos That is above you.
You'll find you don't know How to skate.
It's done.
Because I love you.
Well, that's more like it.
Right, sweetheart?
Right.
Blades is here.
The audition may commence.
Um, Billy Blades Bookoltzer, uh, this is my daughter, Tabitha, and this is my Please, no talking.
I wish to observe the child in silence.
Uh, Tabitha, go on and skate for Mr. Bookoltzer.
Is this some kind of joke?
It looks like she can't stand up under pressure.
It looks like she can't stand up on skates.
Two minutes ago she was brilliant.
Uh, maybe she's tired.
How can she be tired when all she's doing is sitting down?
Madam, your child is a klutz.
What does he mean, "klutz"?
Now that's someone who's hopelessly clumsy.
Oh!
Blades, I tell you, that kid can really skate.
You've always been neurotic and it finally happened.
You've wigged out.
Oh, Mother, that's mean.
Thank you, Mother.
Yes, Endora.
Thank you and goodbye.
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but you asked for it.
Whoa!
Klutz.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
In gay Paris, it's s'il vous plait, in Germany, it's bitte.
Please, Serena, come this way.
I need a baby-sitter.
Ha!
Do I look like Mary Poppins to you?
Well, I'll admit, it's casting against type.
But Esmeralda's not available, and I have a charity luncheon to go to.
And you'd be doing me a big favor.
Charity luncheon?
Do you realize that the French fleet at Saint-Tropez was about to crown me Miss Naval.
Well, I'm sorry, Serena, but your trophy room is overflowing as it is.
And I'm late.
Please be good.
I haven't much choice.
I have to go.
I'll be back in a couple of hours.
Right on.
Blah.
Hi.
Oh, well.
Hi there, snow-white and handsome.
Hi, Serena.
Anything I can do for you?
Uh, no, no, no.
I just came by to, uh, return Darrin's body.
I mean, his putter.
Heh, heh.
Well, I'll just leave it here and be on my way.
Do you know that your far-out, baby-blue eyes kind of turn me on?
Serena, you certainly know how to flatter the senior citizens.
Oh, daddy bear.
Did I ever tell you that I am simply wild about gray hair?
No, as a matter of fact You are?
Well, I've earned every one of them.
Oh, and I love your sense of humor.
So why don't you stick around and we'll break out a bottle of the bubbly and drink and dance and putter around.
Watch it, Serena.
You're gonna turn the old gray fox into the red devil of yesteryear.
And I could do it too.
I'd believe it.
No.
I mean really.
Here.
This will put the color back in your hair and the bloom of youth back in your cheek.
What is it?
Vitamin V. "V"?
For va-va-voom.
Vitamin, huh?
Vitamin plus.
Well, I suppose there's no harm.
Show me a man who has never taken a chance and I'll show you a man who has never lived.
I didn't know I was taking a chance.
Okay, forget it.
Just kidding, just kidding.
Yummy, huh?
What's in it?
Extract of ambrosia.
Delicious.
Well, I'd better be on my way.
Oh, stick around.
That pill's a fast worker.
Really?
Mm.
And so am I. Serena, you're unique, to say the least.
You have no idea.
Yes.
Well, uh Well, thanks for the pill.
I'll be seeing you.
Party poop.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh, Larry!
"Oh, Larry" what?
Well, I think it looks great, but you should have warned me.
About what?
Oh, come on, Larry.
Now, don't be coy.
Do me a favor, Louise.
Call Berlitz and get me a translator because I have no idea what Louise, you won't believe this.
What do you mean, I won't believe it?
I mean, I can see it, can't I?
You still won't believe it.
Serena.
Oh!
Well, Serena, how did everything go?
Oh, everything went just fine.
Tabitha and Adam wanted milk with lunch, so I zapped up a guernsey and milked them a couple of glasses.
Terrific.
Anything else?
Let's see.
Oh, yes.
Weirdo's boss dropped by to return a stick he called a putter.
And I guess that's it.
End of news report.
Serena signing off, and taking off.
Ta.
Well.
Only one harmless cow.
If that's all she did, I guess we can count our blessings.
Well.
How about that.
Amazing, isn't it?
Oh, hi, Sam.
Well, what do you think?
Well, it's a little redder than it used to be.
And I owe it all to Serena and her little magic pill.
Bless her heart.
Where is she?
Uh.
She had to leave.
Well, we've gotta get in touch with her.
I don't think she knows what she's got.
Oh, I think she knows what she's got.
Uh, what do you mean you owe it all to Serena?
Serena's Vitamin V pills.
Va-va-va-voom!
They're sensational.
Don't tell me you didn't know about them?
Oh, yes, I I knew about them.
Have you ever thought of putting them out commercially?
No.
Well, I have.
Why?
Why?
Serena's little pill is worth millions.
Billions.
Forget it, Larry.
It was just for the immediate family and Serena was very naughty to have told you about it.
I see.
I've got a couple of tough negotiators here.
Okay.
I'll tell you what.
I'll be responsible for the marketing, and I'll give you a 20 percent finder's fee.
Look, Larry, I don't blame you for being excited about this  Hold it.
Hold it, Darrin.
Are you sore because I want a part of the action?
There's not gonna be any action.
Very well.
Forget it.
Oh, forgive me for being pushy.
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'll take 20 percent, I'll give you 80 Boy, that red hair sure has made a change in you.
It's more than a new color.
It's a new me.
Now, think it over, and I'll meet you at the office first thing tomorrow morning.
Then we'll go over the small print.
Sam, I'm really worried.
There's something strange happening to him.
It's not just his hair.
He looks younger.
Oh, it's probably your imagination.
No, no.
No, I don't think so.
What do you think?
Uh.
Well, I I think that Larry's going to be just fine.
Hm.
Unless Unless what?
Unless Serena slipped him a sort of a youth pill.
What's a "sort of a youth pill"?
It's a pill.
And it makes him sort of get younger.
And younger.
And younger?
I knew that freaked-out, ding-a-ling cousin of yours wouldn't stop at a cow.
I heard that.
Buster.
Serena, you're all wet.
So is he.
Serena?
Stop.
Eighty-six the downpour.
Darrin, when will you learn that Serena is a highly sensitive creature?
Sure.
Like Attila the Hun.
I figured all you'd want this morning was a cup of coffee.
Wrong.
All I want this morning is Serena and that antidote for Larry.
Sweetheart, I have tried all morning to reach her.
Darrin, my guess is that if you just announce to the atmospheric continuum that you're sorry, Serena will get the message.
No sooner said than done.
Serena, I'm sorry.
I'm just a pushover for a sweet-talking man.
Even if he is a weirdo.
What's everybody so uptight about?
Serena, did you or did you not give Larry a youth pill?
Just a little one.
Enough to make him back up, oh, eight, 10 years, or Or what?
Or more.
How could you do such a terrible thing?
Well, the children were upstairs playing at the time and there wasn't anything else to do.
Don't you realize that Never mind.
That pill has never been given to a mortal.
So there's no telling what will happen.
Now, why don't you be a good cousin and find Dr. Bombay, and get an antidote.
Okay.
But believe me, this is the last time I do a favor for any creepy mortal.
Bye, ding-dong.
Darrin.
I love you.
What does that have to do with anything?
Nothing.
I just like to remind you at times like this.
Now, honey, I realize it's not your fault.
Entirely.
What do you mean "entirely"?
Well, Serena is your cousin.
I, uh, guess I better stick with "I love you".
Funny.
Oh, Samantha, I'm so sorry to barge in on you like this, but I just had to talk to somebody.
Uh, let me guess, it's about Larry?
Oh, yes.
I I'm really worried about him.
He's acting strangely.
Oh.
Well, they all do sometimes.
Come in and sit down.
What do you mean exactly by, uh, "strangely"?
Well, take last night, for instance.
He had a caterer bring in a complete candlelit dinner for two.
With champagne.
And then, after we'd finished dinner, he found some old Glenn Miller records and we danced till 2 in the morning.
Well, that sounds like fun.
Until he suggested we go for a ride.
And do you know where we went?
Where?
We went to Lovers' Lane.
Well, I think that's romantic.
Oh, we've been married for over 20 years.
When we finally did get home, I collapsed in a heap then he called me a party poop.
I'm sure it's just a passing thing.
I guess his hair's gone to his head.
Um what I meant  I know what you meant.
But the thing that really worried me is when he put on that television set and started looking for the Jack Paar Show.
Oh, Samantha, I think he's having a nervous breakdown.
Darrin, don't you think you should be getting to the office?
All right.
Come in.
Stephens.
Come in, come in.
Ha, ha, ha.
Sit down.
Uh "Stephens"?
Yes, we're an informal outfit here.
You can call me Tate.
Uh, look, Larry Tate.
About that pill  So you met McMann, huh?
Well, he is a bit of a pill but once you get to know him, he's not so hard to swallow.
Heh.
Well, it's nice to have you aboard.
I beg your pardon?
Nautical term.
I was Navy.
It means, "Welcome to the outfit".
Stephens, I've been studying your dossier, and unless all this is lies, you've got the stuff to go far in this business.
And business is going to be booming, son.
The '60s are gonna be a decade of growth.
And we're going to share it.
The '60s?
Oh, I know a lot of people have their doubts, but the more optimistic of us even hope that the New York Mets might win the World Series before the '60s are over.
Yeah, that could happen.
Maybe even by 1967?
You married?
Yes, sir.
I am too.
We should get together sometime.
Maybe catch a ball game.
Sure, and sort of, uh, root those Mets into a pennant?
Ha, ha, ha.
I like that optimism.
We're gonna get along just fine, Stephens.
Keep that nose to the grindstone.
You know, we here at McMann & Tate believe in advancement.
And as an incentive, if you're still with the outfit two years from now, you'll become a first vice president.
Oh, thank you very much.
I'd W W What did you say, Tate?
I said, that if you're still with Now I remember what you said.
Would you mind putting that in writing?
Ah-ha.
I like that, Stephens.
Get it down in writing.
October the 15th, 1961.
If, at the end of two years, Darrin Stephens is still with the firm, he shall become a first vice president.
Signed, Larry Tate.
There you are.
Black on white.
Well, thank you very much, Tate.
Okay, Stephens.
Battle stations.
What?
Battle stations.
Oh, yeah.
Aye, aye, sir.
Hello.
Sam, it's me.
Have you heard from Serena yet?
Not yet.
Sometimes Dr. Bombay can be very hard to track down.
Well, things here are worse, and that's an understatement.
You better get over here right away.
Well, Louise is resting in the den.
I'll make my excuses and be right there.
Ah!
Sam, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Sorry, sweetheart.
I'll be more careful in the future.
If there is a future.
Honey, you've got to help me get Larry out of his office before he gets any younger.
How young is he?
Let me put it this way.
I'm gonna have to introduce you to him.
That's young enough.
Is this your office, sir?
Oh, boy.
Are you lost too, sir?
No.
Oh, no, we're not lost.
Not yet.
Well, I am.
Lost and very, very confused.
I'd surely appreciate you telling me what I'm doing here.
You, uh, don't know what you're doing here?
Do you know who you are?
Sure, I'm Lawrence Tate.
Oh, I'm Darrin Stephens, and this is my wife, Samantha.
Pleased to meet you.
How do you do?
What happened to me?
Well, what happened was What's the last thing you remember?
Last thing I I was playing ice hockey for my school team.
I was coming down the ice, right toward the goalie You were hit in the head by a puck and you lost your memory.
Oh?
That's it.
Now, let's get you home.
I'd like to get home.
I don't want to be late for Amos 'n Andy.
Hey.
Hey, this isn't my house.
You're gonna make me miss Amos 'n Andy.
And after that's The Lone Ranger.
Heh.
Sort of cute, isn't he?
Sam.
My name isn't Sam.
It's Larry.
And what happened to my clothes?
And who are you?
Well, we're, uh, friends o-of your parents.
What happened?
It's all right, Larry.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Let's go inside, Larry.
This isn't my house.
Why am I going in here?
Because you're lost.
I'm not lost.
I know where I live.
I live at 1432 Elm Drive.
If you live at 1432 Elm Drive what are you doing here at our house?
I don't know.
Doesn't that prove you're lost?
Come on, let's go in and see if we can find you.
Oh.
Uh.
The children are out back playing.
You're not my mom.
Who's he, Sam?
Oh, he's just one of the neighborhood children.
I have to get him home soon.
Let's go upstairs.
What's that?
It's a television set.
What's a television set?
It's radio with pictures.
Sammy?
I'm upstairs with the goodies.
Oh, it's cousin Serena, making a delivery.
You're gonna love my cousin.
Come on upstairs.
There's something strange about that child.
Oh?
I hadn't noticed.
Ma'am, are you gonna take me home?
I certainly hope so.
Hi, coz.
I've got the antidote.
You can go home right after you take your medicine.
What about me?
You're excused.
And use the door.
Not even a thank you?
Later, Serena.
Ta-ta.
Oh.
Hi there, tall, dark and dull.
Why should I take medicine?
I'm not sick.
This isn't sick medicine.
It's growing-up medicine.
But I'm tall for my age.
Take it and you'll grow up to be a cowboy, like Tom Mix.
I don't wanna grow up to be a cowboy like Tom Mix.
I wanna grow up to be a lover like John Barrymore.
Here.
Drink it.
It's yummy.
Now can I go home?
After you take a little nap.
Now, lie down over here.
Sam.
Well, he'll grow into them.
And get rid of Serena.
Oh.
Your cousin has just been telling me about your family doctor.
Do you think I could consult him about Larry?
Um, stick to your own doctor.
Uh, Serena, thank you so much for the, uh, plant grower.
How long does it take to work?
Like almost immediately, coz.
What am I doing here?
Why didn't you tell me Larry was here?
What's everybody doing here?
Oh, Larry!
You're back to your old, gray self again.
I am?
I am.
Well, Serena, worked for a while.
Maybe you got hold of a bad pill.
They're all bad pills, Serena.
Anything you say, coz.
Well, I guess I'll split.
Try using the front door.
Sorry.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Goodbye.
That pill, it did crazy things to me.
I mean, it made me look younger and feel younger, but suddenly I started having these hallucinations that I was getting younger and younger and younger.
It was like a bad dream.
You're awake now, so why don't you stay for dinner?
We'll spend a pleasant evening and try to forget what happened.
Sounds good to me.
Say, why don't we turn on the radio and listen to Fibber McGee and Molly?
There he goes again.
Uh.
Don't worry, Louise.
It'll wear off.
Well, it Sam, it's a good thing we didn't put that pill on the market.
You tried to warn me about possible side effects.
Larry, when you get those dollar signs in your eyes, no amount of warning will help.
Don't you worry, Larry.
I'm not gonna say "I told you so".
I appreciate that.
But it was weird.
I did a whole number about Well, like when I first met you, Darrin.
Oh, um, speaking of the first time we met.
I ran across a little item the other day while cleaning out my files that I think will interest you.
Oh.
Uh, if you'll remember, I mention from time to time that you offered to make me a first vice president.
I don't remember writing this.
Well, that's your signature.
Yes, my signature, all right, and the date 1961.
But I'm afraid you found this a little too late.
This paper's invalid.
The statute of limitations has run out.
What's for dinner, Sam?
Oh, Larry, you're your old self again.
And we wouldn't want him any other way.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Sam, the doorbell.
What do you suppose I do when you're not home to sound the alarm?
Mrs. Stephens?
Yes.
My name is Maude Hickman.
I'm with the Board of Education.
Oh.
Come in.
Thank you.
Oh, sw Sweetheart?
Uh, this is Mr. Stephens.
This is Mrs. Hickman.
She's with the Board of Education.
Oh.
It has come to our attention that you have a child of school age who is not enrolled in school.
It's true.
Tabitha isn't in school, but I've been tutoring her at home.
Oh, I see.
And what are your qualifications?
Do you have a teaching certificate?
No.
But I have a birth certificate.
Tabitha's.
It says that I'm her mother.
And I think those are pretty good qualifications.
But you have no formal training.
As a mother?
You can make jokes if you like, but this is a serious matter.
You're in violation of the law, you know.
It's just that our little girl is unique.
She's not your run-of-the-mill child.
She has special talents, and we I did not come here to debate with you, Mrs. Stephens.
Your child must be registered in school at once.
If she is not, a court order will be issued directing you to do so.
Is that clear?
Yes, ma'am.
Good day.
Mrs. Hickman?
Yes?
I'd like to ask you something.
Oh?
How did you find out Tabitha wasn't in school?
We have our ways.
Is one of them spying?
I would say that getting the child out of this house for most of the day is probably the best thing that could happen to her.
Sam, are you out of your tree?
Well, I'm sorry.
But she made me furious and I had to get it off my chest.
Terrific.
Now will you kindly get it off her Okay, okay.
And now that the high jinks are over, what are we gonna do about this?
I have a simple solution.
Oh?
What's that?
We don't have any other choice.
I will enroll Tabitha in school today.
Is Tabitha ready for school?
Of course she's ready for school.
The question is, is school ready for Tabitha?
Tabitha, do you remember the promise you made to Daddy and me?
How could I forget?
You made me say it a hundred times.
I know, and I'm sorry, sweetheart.
But it's for your sake just as much as it is ours.
Okay, Mommy.
I'm to pay attention to the teacher, and I'm not supposed to fly.
No witchcraft of any kind.
Okay, Mommy.
All right.
MRS.
Children, Mrs. Peabody's trying to concentrate.
Hold it down, please.
Excuse me.
Not now.
Back to your group.
Well, we don't have a group yet.
Please forgive me.
You're Mrs. Stephens, right?
And this is Tabitha.
I'm Mrs. Peabody.
I was a little surprised when the office called.
Class is nearly half over.
I know, but they told us to get started immediately.
I see.
Well, Tabitha, this is activities period.
So why don't you join the terrarium group?
What's a terrarium?
Terrarium is that tank right over there where we keep the turtles and the frogs and the lizards.
Oh.
Thank you for bringing her in.
Um.
Would it be all right if I stayed a while?
Stayed?
You mean in class?
Oh, no.
That's very poor, psychologically.
We don't wanna set up a dependency pattern.
Uh, we don't?
Well, you see, this is Tabitha's first school experience, and I just thought I can understand your apprehension, Mrs. Stephens, but it would be better if you didn't stay.
The trouble is, Tabitha's a very unusual child and it might take her a little while to get adjusted.
Mrs. Stephens, through the years, I have learned that no child is essentially different from any other child.
Uh.
Yeah, well, uh, Tabitha is unusual in a very unusual way.
Believe me, you haven't a thing to worry about.
What kind of a dumb name is Tabitha?
It's not a dumb name.
How come I've never heard it before?
Because you never met anyone named Tabitha.
Charlton Rollnick Jr., you stop that.
A real problem child.
Fortunately, my only one.
Ha, ha.
You're lucky you only have one.
I hope it stays that way.
Oh, um.
Will Tabitha take the bus, or will she walk home?
Well, we only live a few blocks away but maybe the first day, I should pick her up.
Fine, and don't you worry about a thing.
I'll try.
All right, everybody.
Activities period is over.
Back to your seats.
Back so soon?
I'm sorry.
I was, uh I was wondering.
Maybe it would be better to let Tabitha walk home.
We don't want to set up any dependency pattern.
That's up to you.
I'll just tell her.
I'll tell her.
Tabitha, come here.
Class, this is Tabitha Stephens.
Say hello to Tabitha.
Hello, Tabitha.
And this is Tabitha's mother, Mrs. Stephens.
Say goodbye to Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, that's all right.
I can take a hint.
A school doesn't have to fall on me.
Now, let's see.
Not much choice.
Tabitha, take that desk.
Yes, Mrs. Peabody.
Tomorrow morning, we're going to give you your books and your crayons.
Thank you.
MRS.
Now I'm going to continue reading to you from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.
Apparently, one of you has seen fit to adopt our bullfrog.
Will the adoptive parent please stand up?
Tabitha, did you take the bullfrog?
No, ma'am.
Tabitha, there are lots of rules in this school.
But first and foremost, we do not tell a lie.
I didn't lie.
Tabitha, put the frog back where it belongs.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, you remember, we left Alice just as she arrived at the mad tea party.
Ow!
Apparently, we have a budding opera star in our midst.
Who was responsible for that?
Tabitha, haven't you been taught not to interrupt someone when they're speaking?
She certainly has.
Has Tabitha been misbehaving?
I think it's just that she's not acquainted with our procedures yet.
You stop that, or I'll tell.
Just stop that whispering and settle down.
I, uh, suppose you're wondering why I came back.
Frankly, yes.
Well, I was thinking, maybe it would be better if Tabitha came home on the bus.
Whatever you say.
Ah!
Just what's going on back there?
Her hair.
When I pulled it, I got a shock.
MRS.
I don't know what you're babbling about.
But what business did you have pulling her hair?
Just because.
Just because of that, you'll stay after school tomorrow.
I'll send a note home to your parents.
MRS.
And speaking of parents, I thought you'd left.
Uh, I'm I'm sorry.
I won't be back.
Don't go to extremes.
We like to see you on Parents' Day.
And you're right.
It would be better if Tabitha walked home.
Bye-bye.
Class dismissed.
Just because of you, I have to stay after school.
You'd better let go of me.
What if I don't, huh?
What if I don't?
You'll see, you big bully.
Me?
Why, I wouldn't hurt a fly.
Maybe not, but you're going to love eating them, you You big bully frog.
And don't forget the Tabitha.
You're the first frog freak I've ever met.
So I'm not just sure how to deal with you.
But let's begin by putting the frog back in the terrarium.
But this frog isn't the frog you think it is.
Tabitha, the terrarium.
You heard me, Tabitha.
Put that frog back where it belongs.
But, honest, this frog isn't really a frog.
The frog isn't really a frog?
I mean, he's a frog, but he really isn't.
Oh, stop this nonsense and put that frog back.
Yes, ma'am.
Tabitha, I realize this hasn't been a very good first day for you.
But I'm perfectly aware that it isn't entirely your fault.
Tabitha, will you look at me when I'm speaking to you?
I'm sorry.
You're the product of an overprotective mother.
And I just wish Never mind.
My mommy's gonna wonder where I am.
I'd better run.
Goodbye.
Well, I must say I admire your cool.
It's only a five-minute walk from our house to school, which let out 15 minutes ago.
Darrin, you're being overly concerned.
As a matter of fact, here comes Tabitha now.
How do you know?
How does she know?
Oh, boy, I'm really wigging out.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, Daddy.
Oh, hi, honey.
How was school?
Oh, it's still there.
You see?
I told you there was nothing to be worried about.
Well, I'd better, uh, get back to work.
Mommy, can I go play outside?
Oh, sure.
You want a snack?
Some milk and cookies?
Yes, thank you.
In a minute.
Charlton, you're just being stubborn.
I'm trying to change you back.
Tabitha, where did you get that frog?
Mommy, you'll never guess what happened.
Is that frog who I think he is?
You're smart, Mommy.
You only needed one guess.
It's Charlton.
I thought you said you were gonna try and control yourself.
I tried and tried, honest.
But Charlton grabbed me after class and he kept twisting my arm and hurting me, so what could I do?
You could have punched him in the nose or kicked him in the shins.
Anything would have been more ladylike.
The trouble is, I can't change him back.
What are we going to do?
Well, the first thing we're going to do is not panic.
The second thing is call Charlton's mother.
She's probably worried sick.
Come on.
Yeah, hello?
Uh.
Hello?
Mrs. Rollnick?
Yeah.
Who's this?
This is Mrs. Stephens.
My little girl, Tabitha, is in the same class as your Charlton.
Okay.
Whatever he did to her, I'm sorry.
Uh, no.
No, no, that's not why I'm calling.
He and Tabitha were having such fun that Tabitha brought him here after school.
That darn kid.
He knows he's supposed to come straight home.
He's got a piano lesson at 3:30.
He'll do anything to get out of it.
Well, in that case, I'd be glad to drive him home.
No, no, I'll pick him up.
MRS.
What's your address there?
But really, I'd be happy to Forget it, forget it.
I'll pick him up in 10 minutes.
Goodbye.
Tabitha, we have to work fast.
Now, Charlton's mother is coming to pick him up in 10 minutes.
Now, I want you to tell me everything that happened, step by step, and don't leave out a thing.
Well, after I changed Charlton into a bullfrog, Mrs. Peabody made me put him in with the other frogs.
Then, later, when she wasn't looking That's it.
You picked up the wrong frog.
Oh, Mommy, you solved the whole problem.
Huh.
Certainly, I have.
When Charlton's mother comes, all I have to do is explain to her that her son, the frog, is safe in the terrarium at school.
Meanwhile, she can take this one home as a receipt.
That's silly, Mommy.
You're darn right, it's silly.
You look upset.
I couldn't possibly look as upset as I am.
But we haven't got time to discuss it now.
No wonder Tabitha couldn't tell you apart.
You're as alike as two frogs in a terrarium.
Well, I'm sorry, Charlton.
But you did ask for it.
What are you doing in here?
Exchanging frogs.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going with that frog?
That's school property.
Um.
No.
Not really.
You see, my little girl is in this class, and she left her pet frog.
And when I heard about it, instead of leaving the poor fellow here all night, I thought I'd just come and get him.
So you see, he really isn't school property.
You follow me?
No.
But that's not the only thing I don't understand.
How did you get in here?
Through the door.
But But the door was locked.
Let me ask you something.
When was the last time you had your glasses checked?
I don't wear glasses.
Well, you should.
Then maybe you'd stop seeing things.
Excuse me.
Where'd she?
No question.
I gotta get me some glasses.
And a good psychiatrist.
Hi, I'm Mrs. Rollnick.
Uh, who?
Oh, uh, you must be Charlton's mother.
Right.
Who's Charlton?
We weren't expecting you quite so soon.
Who's Charlton?
Well, when I take Charlton to his piano lesson, I always have to allow a little extra time for kicking and screaming.
Where is he?
Well, he's Who's Charlton?
Well, sweetheart, he's a little friend of Tabitha's, uh, that she brought home from school.
They're out back, playing.
I'll get him.
Sam.
What?
May I speak to you a moment?
When?
Now.
Oh.
Excuse me, Mrs. Rollnick.
Uh.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thank you.
Sam, Tabitha did not come home with a little boy.
Darrin, you picked a most inopportune moment to bring that up.
Sam, I did not see a little boy with Tabitha.
That's because she had him in her pocket.
I know this is gonna be a silly question, but wouldn't that be a tight squeeze?
Not if you've been turned into a frog.
I knew that was a silly question.
I think I'll go in the den and watch my ulcer grow.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rollnick.
I'll get Charlton now.
Oh, thanks.
He's no bargain, but he's the only one we've got.
He's probably hiding.
That's what he's doing.
He'll do anything to get out of his piano lesson.
I think I can find him.
Don't waste your time.
I know how to smoke him out.
Charlton Rollnick!
If you don't come out this very second you're not gonna watch any TV for three weeks, your allowance is gonna be cut in half, and you're gonna have to take two baths this week!
Uh.
Y-Y-You mind if I try?
Be my guest.
Charlton's mother sure is mean, isn't she?
I'm sure she has her problems.
All right, now, Tabitha, do your thing.
You know, if I were Charlton, I think I'd rather stay a frog.
Well, you're not, so the choice isn't yours.
Go ahead.
How do you feel, Charlton?
Oh, my stars.
Tabitha, you didn't put quite enough zip in that zap.
Oh.
You found him, huh?
How have you been, you little devil?
Don't you get fresh with your mother.
What are you trying to do, embarrass me in front of these nice people?
Did you ever hear such insolence?
Wait till your father hears about this.
Now let's go.
Oh.
I I'm sure he didn't mean to be insolent.
Barking at his mother like a frog?
What do you call that?
Well, he knows you're angry.
Maybe he was just trying to amuse you.
Charlton?
Huh?
What happened?
Where am I?
MRS.
Charlton, will you quit stalling and come on?
All right, Charlton, where were you?
I was a bullfrog.
I'm serious.
Where were you?
I was a bullfrog.
MRS.
All right, how did you become a bullfrog?
She made me one.
Charlton, you've always been a rotten kid, except for one thing.
You never lied.
Now, where were you?
I was a bullfrog.
Why does he keep saying that?
Well, uh, maybe it's a case of ego identification.
Yeah.
What's that?
Well, a bullfrog suggests bully, doesn't it?
Yes.
Do you follow me?
No.
Uh.
Children need love and understanding.
Without it, they sometimes become overly aggressive and turn into bullies.
Ah.
Charlton, did you really think you were a bullfrog?
I was a bullfrog.
Love and understanding, Mrs. Rollnick.
All right.
Charlton, dear, say goodbye and thank you to these nice people for having you over and then I've got a nice surprise for you.
Thank you for inviting me over.
What's the surprise?
Well, first, you can forget about your piano lesson.
Really?
And second, we're gonna stop at the ice cream parlor and get you a great big hot-fudge sundae with almonds on top.
And flies?
Flies?
Oh, ha, ha.
That's very funny, Charlton.
He has a delightful sense of humor.
He does?
Oh, yeah, he does, doesn't he?
Okay.
Well, goodbye.
It was a pleasure meeting you all.
Bye.
Say goodbye.
Well, we squeaked by that one.
What about the flies?
Oh, I'm sure that'll wear off by tomorrow.
In the meantime, Mrs. Rollnick can keep enjoying.
Charlton's delightful sense of humor.
Yeah.
Young lady, you have nothing to laugh about.
You started this whole mess.
Now, how are we gonna deal with you?
I have an idea.
What's that?
How about a little love and understanding?
Why is it that I feel like the fox that's been cornered by the chicken?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
They're beautiful, Mommy.
Yes, they are, aren't they, sweetheart?
Look at this.
Now, this is a button from George Washington's coat, just like that one.
Why did it fall off?
I don't know.
Maybe Mrs. Washington didn't sew too well.
Now, look at this.
This is a buckle from his shoe.
See?
Which would be better to take to school?
The buckle from George Washington's shoe, or the button from his coat?
I think you better leave them both here.
They're much too valuable.
But next Monday's Washington's birthday, and today we're having show-and-tell.
Well, you could show the book, and tell the class that your Daddy collects Washington relics.
I guess so.
You finish getting ready for school.
I'll get Daddy's breakfast.
Okay, Mommy.
School days, school days Oh, those golden Fool days It's "rule days," Esmeralda.
Not me, honey.
I was a fool in school.
Oh, George Washington.
I sure wish I could take the real buckle and button to school for show-and-tell instead of this picture.
Everybody else will probably bring pictures.
And we don't wanna be like everybody else, do we?
I'll tell you what.
If you promise to return them right after school I'll get you the buckle and the button.
But Mommy said I couldn't take Daddy's collection.
Oh, we won't touch your daddy's collection.
I'll zap them out of the book.
Then this afternoon after school I'll zap them right back again.
Oh, would you?
Well, I may not be much of a witch, but I can positively do that.
I think.
Now Now, give me a little room.
Find the rhyme that goes with buckle.
Tuckle, wuckle, duckle, chuckle.
Come on, George, and look alive.
I begin to weary of this jive.
Anything happening?
A whole lot.
Oh Am I mad?
Oh, well, you have every right to be, Mr. President.
I I just wanted your buckle and button.
Buckle and button.
But this is even better.
This is delayed battle fatigue from Valley Forge.
If I'm having hallucinations, I I think I should have them sitting down.
Oh, yes.
Here.
Oh, dear.
Was Tabitha very upset about not being able to take my collection to school?
Oh, no, sweetheart, she understood.
That's the bus.
Tabitha.
I heard it, Mommy.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Bye, Mommy.
Bye, Daddy.
Bye, honey.
Have a good day.
These are the times that try men's souls.
Who was that?
I hate to guess.
Uh, sweetheart, why don't you go to the office and I'll find out what's up?
Oh, I've got to reverse the spell.
I Find the rhyme that goes with buckle.
And then we'll have a little chuckle.
Or is it "knuckle"?
Oh, dear, that doesn't even make sense.
Oh, Samantha.
I'm afraid we have a visitor.
Can't be.
Well, maybe it can't be But it is.
George Washington.
At your service, mistress.
I just wanted his buckle and button.
Now I understand.
Martha, awaken me.
Oh, uh, Mr. President, you are not having a dream.
You're right, Martha, it's a nightmare.
Mr. President, why don't you lie down and take a nap?
Perhaps you'll awake refreshed.
For a character in a nightmare, you're very kind.
Oh.
Ah, you, get hopping on popping him back.
I guess you're wondering who's upstairs.
A little bit, yes.
You sure you wanna know?
I'm sure I don't wanna know.
But eventually I'm gonna find out.
It might as well be now.
Well, it, uh It was an innocent little mistake.
Esmeralda was trying to zap George Washington's button and buckle out of the collector's book for Tabitha to take to school.
And instead she got George Washington.
George Washington.
Sam, go up and help her get rid of him.
Well, I can't do that.
A watched witch never remembers.
Oh.
There you are.
Perhaps you could tell me just where I am in this dream.
I tried to keep him upstairs, but I couldn't.
Oh, boy, am I some rotten witch.
I feel you have the advantage of me.
You seem to recognize me, yet I have no idea who you are, where I am, or for that matter, how I came to be here.
Well, sir, I'm Samantha Stephens, and this is my husband Darrin.
Mr. President.
Pleasure.
Oh, well, I've never dreamed a home like this before.
What century is this?
The 20th century, Mr. President.
Impossible.
It's against the laws of nature.
Would I lie to George Washington?
Ah, yet I must admit the surroundings are Are very strange.
Ah.
Well, there are devices in this room that I've never seen before.
Oh, no, no, no, this must be a dream.
I think I'll take a walk and clear my head.
No, no, no, Mr. President, you-you can't go out.
Sir, this is my dream, and if I wish to go walking, I shall.
Mr. President, I think maybe you should know the truth.
Won't you sit down?
Yes, let's just After you, madam.
Uh, Esmeralda, why don't you go into the kitchen and work on the you-know-what?
I'm going, I'm going.
The truth is, Mr. President, that I am a witch.
So is Esmeralda, and she got you here by mistake.
A witch?
Well, maybe her, but certainly not you.
Yes, Mr. President, me.
That's impossible.
There are no such things as witches.
Well, I'm sorry, Mr. President, but how else are you gonna explain what's happened?
So this is the 20th century.
How fare the 13 states?
We're 50 now.
Fifty?
Imagine that.
What's happened to Betsy Ross's lovely flag?
No, that's in a museum.
So they haven't forgotten us.
Oh, no.
No, as a matter of fact, you're known as the father of our country.
Your picture's on the one dollar bill.
Mm-hm.
Here, let me show you.
There.
See?
What's this?
Oh.
I must say, that is rather flattering.
I don't think they did you justice, sir.
Oh Ah, what's this?
Uh, that's a five dollar bill.
And who is this bearded fellow?
That's Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President.
Oh, well, he must have been a very fine President to have his name honored on a five dollar bill.
He was an excellent president, sir.
Better than me?
Oh, I I wouldn't say that.
Then why is President Lincoln's name on a five dollar bill, while the father of his country is only on a one dollar bill?
Uh, w Well, um, you see, more people can afford one dollar bills than five dollar bills, which means more people see your picture than Abraham Lincoln's.
Uh, Mr. President.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Larry.
No, of course I haven't left yet.
If I'd left yet, would I be talking to you?
I'll tell you why I haven't left yet.
It's because next Monday the 21st, is George Washington's birthday.
And that's why.
And I'm paying homage to his memory.
And as soon as I'm through paying homage, I'll be there.
The green animal is talking.
It's called a telephone.
What is it?
Uh, mostly it's a nuisance.
I'm leaving right away, Larry.
Goodbye.
Sir, you may be a very enlightened gentleman of the 20th century, but you're mistaken about my birthday.
It's not the 21st, it's the 22nd.
Yes, Mr. President, that's another story.
Excuse me.
Sweetheart, you have just got to get to the office.
Yeah.
Are you sure you're gonna be all right?
I promise.
Don't let him out of your sight.
Now, don't worry, I won't.
It's been a pleasure, Mr. President.
My pleasure, sir.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
What manner of beast is that?
It's called an automobile.
Incredible.
The county's changed a lot since you were here.
C Come on, I'll show you.
Come on, this way.
Now, these are the 50 United States.
And here is Washington D.C., the capital of the United States.
They saw fit to change the date of my birthday.
At least it's comforting to know they didn't change the name of the capital.
Things are looking better.
And this is the State of Washington.
A whole state named in my honor.
Imagine that.
Ah, my head is swimming from all this.
I I think I'd best sit down.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to lie down in the guest room?
Oh, no, no, no, I'm too exhilarated.
But I could do with a brisk cup of tea.
Right away, Mr. President.
Esmeralda, this is getting serious.
You have got to remember that incantation.
I'm trying, I'm trying.
Oh, it's just no use, Samantha.
I can't remember.
Well, all right, all right.
Uh, keep trying.
In the meantime, I better not keep the president waiting for his tea.
Mr. President?
General Washington.
Oh, no.
George?
George?
George?
Oh, George.
George.
George.
Has he disappeared?
Yes.
Oh, I knew I could do it.
He disappeared through the door.
Well, as long as he disappeared.
Esmeralda, hold down the fort.
Pardon me, sir.
Have you seen a man walking down the street dressed, uh, rather strangely?
I don't think he was dressed strangely, considering he was George Washington.
Oh, then you did see him.
Did he say where he was going?
Well, he was just wandering around surveying the neighborhood, as he put it.
I suggested he take a walk in the park.
My uncle hangs around there.
He thinks he's Thomas Jefferson.
I mean, maybe they got a lot in common.
You have no idea.
Father and I Went down to town Along with Captain Goodwin And there we see The men and boys As thick As hasty pudding Yankee doodle keep it up Yankee doodle dandy Mind the music And the steps And with the girls Be handy Man, that cat's far out.
Earlier, I stood here and listened to some of you explain what is going on in this country.
Things like assassinations, pollution, wars to end wars that don't end wars.
This does not please me.
You tell them, George.
Where is the voice of the people?
Remember what my friend Tom Jefferson said: "What country can preserve its liberties "unless its rulers are warned from time to time that the people preserve the spirit of resistance".
Okay, break it up, George.
George?
You will refer to me as Mr. President or General Washington.
Sorry, general, but, uh, you have to break it up.
And just what is it that you want me to break up?
This rally.
Unless, of course, you have a park permit to speak.
The only permit I need is the Constitution of the United States.
Hear, hear.
Hear, hear, hear.
Excuse me.
Have you seen a man in a costume come by here lately?
I sure did.
He was singing "Yankee Doodle Dandy".
Terrific.
I thought so.
Oh, he went that way.
Why don't you be a good fella and tell me where you escaped from?
I have escaped from the past into the present and I must say that what I've seen so far does not please me.
But you're gonna break it up or you're under arrest.
Under the abstract theory of our government a person is entitled to resist illegal arrest.
We are allowed the right of free assembly under our Constitution.
Yeah, that's right.
Right on.
Uh, Mr. President.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, mistress.
I left your home without so much as by your leave.
But please stand aside, I am about to run this tyrant through.
Okay, pop, now, I've dealt with all kinds of hippies.
Now put that sword away.
I think I'm being insulted.
What is a hippie?
Lady, are you responsible for this dodo?
What did the dodo do?
Uh What did he do?
Well, he's inciting a riot, and threatening me with a dangerous weapon.
Well, officer, he belongs to me, and I think I can explain.
En garde, defend yourself.
He don't belong to you anymore, lady.
Now he belongs to me.
Come on, George.
Come on.
The charge is creating a disturbance, holding a meeting without a permit, assaulting an officer.
Bail is $2000.
How soon would the hearing be?
The hearing will be in four weeks.
I protest.
The Constitution guarantees to every citizen the right of a speedy trial.
Sergeant, in view of the advanced age of the defendant, uh, couldn't we have the trial sooner?
How old are you?
Well, he's Two hundred and forty.
Four weeks.
Post your bail with the clerk.
I'm afraid you can take the man out of the 18th century, but you can't take the 18th century out of the man.
Well, Mr. President, it wasn't your fault.
How could you have known?
What has happened to this country that was founded on freedom?
Does the Constitution still exist?
The Bill of Rights?
Yes, of course, Mr. President.
Then why do the people not exercise their rights?
Sometimes it's easier to be led than to lead.
And a great many of our citizens prefer to stand on the sidelines and ignore their rights, instead of defend them.
They're called the silent majority.
Experience has shown that mankind is more disposed to suffer evils while those evils are sufferable than to right themselves and abolish those abuses.
Master Stephens, I'm looking forward to my day in court.
And you'll have it, Mr. President.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
I thought the hearing was to be in four weeks.
Well, I, uh, pulled a few strings and got them to move it up to tomorrow.
Oh.
Well, I hate to impose my problems on you, mistress, but would it be at all possible for you to bring John Adams out of the past and represent me in court?
He's a very fine orator and I would feel I Um, I'm afraid I can't do that.
And besides, Mr. President, uh, you won't need a lawyer in court.
I pulled a few more strings, and you'll have a hearing in the judge's chamber.
You seem to be very expert at pulling strings.
Sure you didn't resort to bribery?
Oh, no, of course not, Mr. President.
It's just that the charges are so absurd, we don't wanna take up the jury's time.
This does not please me.
The American people should know of this outrage.
Well, it's an outrage, all right, but, uh, they might get to know a little more than is good for them.
The truth, madam, never hurt anyone.
Look at it this way, Mr. President.
Uh, I am a witch, and there aren't very many of us around.
We'd really prefer to remain the silent minority.
Oh, yes, I understand.
Even in the 20th century, people are not prepared to accept you?
Well, I've heard your views, and I will take them into account.
May I use your study for tea and contemplation?
Certainly, Mr. President.
By your leave.
Backwards.
Say, maybe that's the answer.
I think I've got it.
Jive this of weary to begin.
I alive look George on come.
What is that supposed to be?
That is supposed to be an incantation read backwards.
Hm.
Well, how's that gonna help?
How's it gonna hurt?
The President will have his tea in the den.
Good luck.
How come you witches can do anything but you can't come up with a witch psychiatrist for her?
I'll bring that up at the next coven.
Eureka!
I did it.
I did it.
I'm almost proud of myself.
Esmeralda, even I'm proud of you.
He likes me?
We all do.
I don't know what we'd do without you.
Don't answer that, Darrin.
Oh   Oh, dear, dear.
A president without his shoes is like a lady without her powder puff.
Oh, now let's see.
Size 11, shoes of leather.
George needs you For the winter weather.
Well, he's gone.
And so is $2000 bail.
Like I said: "Cheap at twice the price".
But I must admit one thing, though.
This has been an experience I'm happy to put behind me, but it's been one that I'll always cherish.
That's sweet.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I didn't mean to do it.
I mean, I was only trying to help.
Well, a person could catch his death of cold without his shoes.
Esmeralda, what did you do?
I was afraid you'd ask that.
When I zapped the president back, everything went except this shoes.
So I did another incantation to get his shoes to go back to him.
What happened?
Well, I couldn't zap his shoes back.
Well, that's no tragedy.
I'm sure he has another pair of shoes.
He won't need them.
He came back to collect the ones he left behind.
He's back?
But now he's got company.
What are you talking about?
Well, I think I rhymed "life" with "wife".
Esmeralda.
Martha, may I present our hosts, Master and Mistress Stephens.
George, forgive me for not believing your fanciful tale.
I should have known you could never tell a lie.
Don't miss the further adventures of George Washington next week on Bewitched.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Which would be better to take to school?
The buckle from George Washington's shoe or the button from his coat?
I think you better leave them both here.
They're much too valuable.
A simple request, a simple refusal.
That should have been the end of it.
But Esmeralda was babysitting, the sometime maid and the all-time goof-up.
If Tabitha couldn't have the real buckle and button, Esmeralda would zap them out of the book.
Instead, she got the whole picture.
Get the picture?
Samantha and Darrin were kept busy entertaining their distinguished visitor, but the father of his country was getting restless.
So when Samantha's back was turned, he decided to inspect the state of the neighborhood and got himself involved in listening and making political speeches.
By the time Samantha had caught up with him, the father of our country was being arrested for disturbing the peace.
Bail was posted and George was returned to Darrin's custody to await a court hearing.
And Esmeralda finally remembered the incantation to send George Washington back where he came from.
Did she succeed?
You bet your boots she did.
Or rather, shoes.
Washington's shoes, which got left behind.
What's a general without his shoes, right?
So Esmeralda tried to return them to the general.
She goofed, and guess what returned instead.
Right, the general.
Who is the lady?
That's no lady, that's his wife.
Martha, may I present our hosts: Master and Mistress Stephens.
George, forgive me for not believing your fanciful tale.
I should have known you could never tell a lie.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Who is the magician responsible for all this?
Me.
But I'm no magician.
I'm just a rotten witch.
Oh, Esmeralda, y-you had an unfortunate accident.
I'd call it more of a crack-up.
Darrin.
Ah, Mr. President, I assure you.
Esmeralda will find a way to send you back.
We're in no hurry.
I've told Martha so much about the wonders of the 20th century.
Perhaps Mistress Stephens will be good enough to show you about.
I would like to have a few private words with Master Stephens.
E-Esmeralda, while I'm showing Mrs. Washington around, you better put on your thinking cap and try to remember that spell.
Why?
The president just said he's in no hurry.
Esmeralda.
Oh, dear.
Don't yell at her like that or she'll She did.
Did you see that?
That's nothing.
Wait till you see the miracles in the kitchen.
Oh, now you've done it.
She's gone.
She's our only link with the past.
Without her, you can't get back.
That is precisely what I wish to discuss with your husband.
I'd love to see your kitchen.
Oh.
This way.
Master Stephens.
Heh-heh.
I can't tell you how happy I am to be among you.
Please don't misunderstand, Mr. President.
It's not that we don't enjoy your company, but I realize I am somewhat of an embarrassment to you, but I would be considerably more of an embarrassment to everyone if I failed to come to that hearing.
Oh, forget about the hearing, Mr. President.
I'll forfeit the bail.
I can afford it.
But my reputation cannot.
I did not force the evacuation of the British from Boston by running from battle.
But this is not 1776.
A coward is a coward in any age.
No, Master Stephens.
If I have violated some rule concerning free speech or assembly, I will defend myself.
However, I will rely upon your advice as to my deportment in court.
What is this?
Oh, well, uh, that's a dishwasher.
You see, you, uh, put the dirty dishes in here and then you turn it on.
And then later it stops by itself and you, uh, take out the clean dishes.
Oh.
Heh.
Oh, you have two dishwashers?
No, no, that's a washer-dryer.
It does the same thing with clothes, as the dishwasher does with dishes.
A great step forward for mankind, I suppose.
Well, for womankind, really.
You don't approve, do you?
Oh, I don't know.
I remember, as a young wife my great pride in the snowy whiteness of my linens.
Oh, nowadays, snowy white comes in a box.
Hm.
And the sweet smell of sun-dried sheets?
Eventually, somebody will figure out a way to package that too.
Oh, I hope not.
Well, have you been properly amazed, Martha?
Mr. President, I have been amazed.
Mrs. Washington has convinced me that we haven't learned much in 200 years.
Oh, now, now, Mrs. Stephens, George will think I've been rude.
I would never think that, my dear.
Well, shall we retire?
This time change has made me weary.
Are we staying?
Till after the hearing tomorrow.
What hearing?
I'll tell you in bed.
At least the bed has not gone out of fashion.
Oh, no.
It's more popular than ever.
The guest room is at the top of the stairs.
We'll find our way.
Thank you.
Good night.
You know something, Sam?
That's a great man.
And the privilege of knowing him makes me glad Esmeralda goofed.
Oh, well, it's sweet of you to look at it that way.
Now, get that goof-up back, because right after the hearing I want those two gently zapped out of here.
Oh, Sam, George and Martha are already down for breakfast.
I know.
I know.
Any luck getting Esmeralda?
I've been trying.
Oh, well, all right, I'll try some more.
Aries, Gemini and Taurus Blend your voices into chorus.
Sing out the name of Esmeralda.
Libra, Scorpio and Pisces.
These are the times That are known as crises.
Okay, okay.
But if you holler at me, I'll just pop out again.
No, he's not going to holler at you.
Where have you been?
He's hollering.
No, he isn't hollering.
He's just been worried about you.
Yeah?
Well, I've been on Pluto, brooding.
Oh, well, if you'd brooded here, we wouldn't have been so worried about you.
I can't be trusted near decent people.
Yeah, well, just forget that and try and remember the spell.
I have remembered it.
So shall I send them back?
No.
Do you mean to tell me I've done that brooding for nothing?
Uh, no.
No, we want you to send them back, but not until after the hearing.
Oh, well, then, why don't you get out of my kitchen?
Breakfast will be ready in a few minutes.
Thank you.
Mr. President, Mrs. Washington.
How did you folks sleep last night?
Not too well.
Martha was kept awake by the big birds.
Uh, the big what?
Birds.
The make the most monstrous roar as they fly by.
It's frightening.
We're sorry if you were disturbed.
The neighborhood's on their flight pattern.
What species are they?
They're called turbo jetus.
They're very common and completely harmless.
I'll get it.
Good morning.
Mr. President.
Good morning.
Why, thank you.
Good morning, Sam.
Larry, what are you doing here?
Why, I came to drive Darrin to work.
He knows how to drive.
Larry, is there some special reason why you wanted me to drive with you?
Yes, my seat belt's broken and I want you to hold me in the car.
Plus, we have an meeting with the Whirlaway people, and I thought we could go over some ideas en route.
Well, w-why don't you go ahead?
H-he'll be there in a bit.
We were just having breakfast.
Thanks, Sam.
I could use a cup of coffee.
But Uh, L-Larry I'd like you to meet some relatives of mine from out of town.
This is Martha and George.
This is Larry Tate, a business associate of Darrin's.
Heh-heh.
How do you do?
What sort of work do you gentlemen do?
We're in advertising.
Oh, what is advertising?
They're really out of this world.
Indeed, we are.
Uh, Larry, um, we have that 10:30 meeting with the Whirlaway people.
Oh, sure, sure.
Heh.
Uh, nice meeting you folks.
Never mind the coffee, Sam.
Bye.
I-I suppose you're wondering how I'm going to explain that.
Frankly, yes.
So am I. I mean Well, you see, the old guy is a retired history professor.
His specialty was George Washington.
I'm afraid he finally, uh, slipped a cog.
No kidding.
Yeah.
He insists on using the name George Washington.
Wears all those old clothes.
And the wife?
Well, she does it to humor him.
It's complicated.
I'll fill you in at the office.
We don't wanna be late.
Heh.
I can't help but admire the old boy.
I say, if you have to go out of your mind, go out in a big way.
Wait a minute.
I have a sensational idea.
Well, tell me on the way to the office.
It's so obvious I'm surprised you didn't see it.
In there is the answer.
It's brilliant.
How about Washington Whirlaway washing machines?
A machine that bears the name of the father of our country.
A name that stands for honesty and truth.
We peg the concept on that.
No, no, no.
Mr. Washington wouldn't hear of it.
Just let me ask him.
No.
No  Now, Mr. President, we would like to ask your permission to use your name for an advertising concept for Whirlaway washing machines.
We have an idea to change the name to Washington Whirlaway washing machines.
I don't understand.
You wish to use my name for a commercial venture?
Terrific.
Just the right quality.
Honesty, integrity.
Don't listen to him, sir.
This machine would bear my name?
In letters that big.
Oh, isn't that nice, George?
Larry, it lacks dignity.
What could be more dignified than a guy playing the father of our country?
You can't get more dignified than that.
Listen to me, general.
You play along with us and there's a nice royalty in it for you.
"Royalty"?
After the revolution they wanted to crown me king of America.
I refused.
I do not believe in royalty.
Heh.
Well, then, we'll discuss other financial arrangements.
Does, um, this Abraham Lincoln have a washing machine named after him?
Not that I know of.
Oh, that's too bad.
Just what is expected of me?
To stay home and rest for the hearing this afternoon.
This isn't going to take a lot out of him, Sam.
We'll just prepare a little TV copy for him to read to the Whirlaway people, then we'll send him on home.
Larry, I won't let him do it.
Mr. Stephens, you may be my host, but if Mr. Tate wishes to honor me by naming a washing machine after me, I should return the compliment with a visit.
Shall we go?
After you, Mr. President.
Well, don't just stand there.
Go after them.
And don't let the father of our country out of your sight.
Right.
Mr. Jamieson, good to see you.
Tate.
You know Darrin Stephens?
Mr. Jamieson.
Stephens.
And this is the man who's going to present our idea.
George Washington, president of the United States.
I'd like you to meet Hector Jamieson, president of Whirlaway Products.
Jamieson.
Jamieson.
There was a Corporal Jamieson who was in my regiment at the Battle of Long Island.
He was my grandfather's grandfather.
He was also a coward.
He was court-martialed and drummed out of service.
How dare you.
He was only joking, Mr. Jamieson.
It was no joking matter.
He was standing guard duty.
Let's drop the matter for now, huh, Mr. President?
Mr. Jamieson, please play along.
He's a bit eccentric.
A bit eccentric?
What difference does it make?
Just look at him.
He could be the reincarnation of Washington.
Now, please, just sit down and let us show you what we have.
Shoot.
Shoot?
If we are to duel, I would prefer swords.
He means read it.
"Ladies, this is Honest George "asking you to let a Washington Whirlaway washing machine "whirl away the dirt while you wile away the time "and your clothes will be cleaner than clean and whiter than white".
How could anything be cleaner than clean or whiter than white?
Oh, it's just a way of saying it, Mr. President.
It doesn't make sense.
So few things do.
Heh.
It's a sign of the times.
"Then use the Whirlaway washer, America's finest".
Is it really?
Would I lie to you, Mr. President?
I don't know you well enough to make that judgment.
Mr. Jamieson, why is this America's finest washing machine?
Is this some kind of a put-on?
Heh-heh.
Mr. President, please, just read what is written.
Not another word until you answer my question.
After all, if my name is to be used, I will not have it tarnished by falsehood.
Look, it's a darn good washer.
Now, read it.
Please.
"Superior washing machine".
"Ultra washing machine".
"Standard washing machine".
"Whirlaway washing machine".
Each one looks very much like the others.
Each one is very much like the others.
Then why do you give them different names?
It's called merchandising, Mr. President.
You see, Whirlaway builds them, and then stores put their own labels on them.
Whirlaway washing machine is no better or worse than the others.
Correct.
In good conscience, I cannot say that Whirlaway washing machine is better than the others.
I've had just about enough of this.
And so have I, sir.
Yesterday I was arrested for defending the constitution of the United States.
Today, I am asked in the name of honesty to utter falsehoods.
I will not lend my name to this deception.
Get this nut out of here.
Yeah, get this nut out of here.
With pleasure, gentlemen.
Mr. President.
Here.
This might not make you feel better, but at least you'll enjoy feeling rotten.
So we lost the account, but somehow that doesn't seem to bother me.
Seeing George Washington blast Mr. Jamieson was worth it.
I'm glad he did it, and I'm glad we lost the account.
George, you promised to rest.
No, no, Martha.
I cannot rest until I apologize to my host for my outburst.
No apologies necessary, Mr. President.
This afternoon when I go to court, I promise to cause as little trouble as possible.
Heh-heh.
I'm sure you will, sir.
Well, we better get going.
Oh, I'm eager to do battle.
I was trying to be reasonable with him, Your Honor, when he pulled a sword on me.
Uh, Your Honor, may I question the witness?
If you're going to act as this gentleman's attorney, you may.
Officer Crandal, did you examine the sword?
I don't have to examine a sword to know it's a deadly weapon.
Your Honor, I give you the People's Exhibit A. Now, examine the edge.
That's not a fighting sword.
That's a ceremonial sword.
It couldn't cut butter.
Your Honor, can I see that?
Now, if he had hit me on the head with this, the ceremony could have been my funeral.
Your Honor, all I can say is, I was protecting myself from unlawful arrest.
The citizens of this country are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights.
Among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
And the right of free speech.
There he goes again with all that radical talk.
Your Honor, I was only doing my duty.
And he was conducting a rally without a permit.
Um, what, Officer Crandal, in your mind, constitutes a rally?
Addressing people constitutes a rally.
How many?
One?
Two?
A hundred?
There couldn't have been more than a dozen people standing around, chatting.
Well, he was doing all the chatting.
They were just listening.
Well, maybe if you hadn't come by and broken it up, they might have chatted back.
As a matter of fact, it was their chatting that started him chatting.
Mister Uh, what shall I call you?
You may call me President Washington, sir.
And, um, where do you come from, president?
Virginia, sir.
Oh, yes, yes, where the father of our country was born.
I am the father of your country, sir.
And how did you get into this century, president?
Providence brought me here, Your Honor.
There, I think I answered that question without lying.
And how do you plead?
Uh, may I answer that, Your Honor?
Certainly.
Not guilty.
Now, Mrs. Stephens, we can't have our citizens going around attacking officers of the law with swords.
Ceremonial.
Ceremonial.
Especially while masquerading as George Washington, which I find offensive in itself.
I am not an impostor, sir.
Um Your Honor, I-I don't think it makes any difference whether he's George Washington or not.
What's important is that this gentleman has served to remind us of the things that George Washington stands for.
Oh, I'll be the first to admit that his behavior, to some, might seem a bit eccentric.
But what a noble eccentricity, sir.
I mean, would you rather have eccentrics who think they are Benedict Arnold or John Wilkes Booth?
Your point is well taken, Mrs. Stephens.
The president was merely defending the Constitution of the United States, which is something he holds very dear.
And he was acting under his rights of peaceful assembly and free speech.
I rest my case.
Mrs. Stephens, it's lamentable but true that there are times when in the interests of maintaining law and order, we We tend to overlook those rights given to our citizens by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
You have quite effectively reminded me that this is one of those times.
Case dismissed.
Thank you, Your Honor.
Now, may I have my sword back?
Certainly, if you'll sign this receipt.
May I ask you a question, sir?
You may, sir.
Will you continue to be George Washington?
No man should live beyond his time.
Therefore, although I shall continue to be George Washington, for I can be no other, I will not be that untimely gentleman in your gracious presence.
Well, what did he say?
He's leaving town.
Uh, Mrs. Stephens.
If he isn't George Washington, he ought to be.
Right on.
We want you to know that although we enjoyed our visit, we do feel that we've rather overstayed our welcome.
Not at all, sir.
It was a pleasure having you.
Oh, that's very kind of you, but George and I must be getting back now.
Esmeralda.
Now?
Now.
Okay.
Jive this of weary to begin.
I alive look George on come.
What is she doing?
Tsk.
She's reversing time by reversing the spell.
Can't she say it to herself?
It sounds ridiculous.
Yeah.
Uh, E-Esmeralda, say it to yourself.
K-keep going, Esmeralda.
Have a nice trip.
It worked, Esmeralda.
It worked.
They're gone.
Gone?
Without even a "fare thee well"?
They waved.
Oh, in that case:   I-I'll get it.
Judge Armstrong.
I must see him at once.
Mr. President.
Oh.
He's He's not here.
We don't have a forwarding address.
I'll put a tracer on him.
What's wrong?
Look, look, look.
Look at this.
It's a copy of a letter from Washington to James Madison.
The signatures are identical.
Well, the court clerk is a collector of Washington memorabilia.
He claims that this signature is authentic.
That's impossible.
Well, that's what I thought.
So we took the signature to Judge Cramer, who's also a collector.
He offered me $500 for the autograph.
He insists it's authentic.
You don't say.
Well, it can't be.
Can it?
Well, uh, like you said, if he isn't George Washington, he oughta be.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Hi, sweetheart, I'm taking orders for breakfast.
Waffles, pancakes, eggs?
Oh, just coffee for me.
I've got that breakfast meeting with Larry.
Well, I've got to get going myself.
I'm taking Tabitha to school half an hour early today.
Oh, yeah.
Today is the big day.
Is Tabitha nervous?
Darrin, this isn't a test to see if she can get into Harvard.
It's just a test to see if she can skip to the second grade.
Buon giorno.
It's not so buon anymore.
It could get worse.
How could it get worse?
You're already here.
Uh, is this going to take long?
No.
All I want to know is, what is this I hear about school?
Mother, it's not polite to eavesdrop.
I was not eavesdropping.
You mean the house is bugged.
Samantha.
Tell Durweed he's living dangerously when he uses the word "bug".
It's giving me ideas.
Mother says you're I heard.
I heard.
Now, what's this about school?
Simple.
Tabitha's started school.
Where?
Towner's Elementary.
A mortal school?
What's wrong with a mortal school?
I went to one.
You've just answered your own question.
Samantha, I'm violently opposed to it.
As a grandmother, you are certainly entitled to your opinion.
And as a mother, I am entitled to ignore it.
How can you deprive Tabitha of the superior training that only a proper witches' finishing school can give her?
Mother, knock it off.
Very well.
I know when I'm not wanted.
Since when?
Hi, Grandmamma.
"Hi, Grandmamma".
Is that the best you can do after I've come halfway around the world for one of your smiles?
Not that kind of smile.
It's the best I can do, Grandmamma.
What's wrong, my precious?
School.
I have to take a test.
They want to see if I'm smart enough to go into the second grade.
Of course you're smart enough.
Do you doubt it?
I don't know.
I never took a test before.
Listen to your grandmamma.
You are going to pass magna cum laude.
Give her knowledge Oh ye muses.
All the knowledge That she chooses.
Aristotle, Shakespeare, Plato All the languages in NATO.
Science back to Galileo.
Medicine From the brothers Mayo.
You'll know it all From A to Z. Awake now My little chickadee.
It's time for school, sweetheart.
Coming, Mother.
You coming, Grandmamma?
No, I think I'd better be going.
Now, Tabitha, this is a very important examination.
So you don't want to rush it.
There are 30 questions.
Answer them the best you can.
Yes, ma'am.
All right.
Begin.
Mrs. Stephens.
The examination should take about 20 minutes to complete.
We have our coffee set up here.
I hate to leave her alone.
It's her first test.
Sorry.
It must be taken in private.
Would you care for cream and sugar?
No.
No coffee, thank you.
I'm nervous enough.
Mrs. Stephens, there's no reason to be nervous.
I'm sure Tabitha will do very well.
I'm finished.
Oh, that's fine, Tabitha.
Now go on to the second one.
I've finished it all, Mrs. Peabody.
See, I filled in all the spaces.
Sweetheart, the idea of the test isn't just to fill in the blanks willy-nilly.
First you must study the problem, then answer.
But I did.
You did?
She did.
Why, this is impossible.
She's answered every question correctly.
Does that mean I can skip to the second grade?
Every one right in less than 30 seconds.
This must be some kind of a world record.
Mrs. Stephens, Tabitha is a gifted child.
Oh, please don't say that, Mrs. Peabody.
She's a perfectly normal child.
I suspect she's had some tutoring from her grandmamma.
No, there is no way to prepare for this kind of an examination.
She seems to be particularly adept in mathematics.
It's a snap.
Can you do long division?
I can try.
Incredible.
And she did it all in her head.
Mrs. Stephens, do you have any mathematical prodigies in your family?
Well, her grandmother's pretty good at it.
Maybe she passed it on to Tabitha.
Why didn't you tell us when you registered her that she had this special talent?
Well, we didn't want her to get any special attention.
Does that mean she's going to be able to move up to the second grade?
Second grade?
Mrs. Stephens, Tabitha is a genius.
I want her to meet our principal, Mr. Roland.
This is my pupil, Tabitha, and her mother, Mrs. Stephens.
How do you do?
How do you do?
This child has just completed this test in 30 seconds with a score of 100 percent.
I don't believe it.
Who cribbed her?
Her grandmother.
Can we go now?
Oh, no, Mr. Roland.
My tests are all top-secret.
There's no way anyone can prepare for them.
Now, watch this.
Tabitha, I want you to add up 49, A thousand thirteen.
One thousand thirteen.
What is this?
Some kind of a trick?
That's right.
It's a trick.
It has nothing to do with her intelligence.
Now, if you'll excuse us, she has an appointment with her grandmother.
I did not give you permission to leave the room.
So you're some kind of little Albert Einstein, are you?
Believe me, she is no Einstein.
Oh, you're right, Mrs. Stephens.
Einstein's genius didn't appear until he was much older.
But you do know who Albert Einstein was, don't you?
Oh, yes.
The theory of relativity.
Tabitha, it's impolite to show off.
What do you know about the theory of relativity?
Nothing.
Everything.
It discards the concept of time and space as absolute entities and views them as relative to moving frames of reference.
That's incredible.
Incredible, Mr. Roland, but true.
Oh, what a pretty picture.
MRS.
That's Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa.
It's Salaino's Mona Lisa, painted in the 16th century.
No, Tabitha, Leonardo da Mrs. Peabody, Salaino.
This is scary.
Even the head of my art department didn't know that.
Well, uh, we take her to art galleries a lot.
As a matter of fact, we're late for a gallery right now.
You know something?
That child frightens me.
True nobility is exempt from fear.
That's Shakespeare.
Do you know Shakespeare?
Of course she doesn't read Shakespeare.
No, I don't read Shakespeare.
Then how did you know that quotation?
I don't know, but I know it.
I know everything.
Except how to be modest.
Tabitha, will you wait out in the outer office for a moment?
I want to talk to your mother privately.
Yes, Mr. Roland.
Well, Mrs. Stephens, I don't have to tell you, your child's an intellectual prodigy.
Well, I know what you're thinking, Mr. Roland, and I wish you'd forget it.
Tabitha is going into the second grade, and that's as far as she is going.
But she's a mental giant.
Well, maybe she'll grow out of it.
I repeat.
The second grade.
Now, do I have your promise?
As you wish, Mrs. Stephens.
If you'll excuse me, I think I'll take Tabitha home.
This excitement's been a little bit too much for me.
Uh, her.
Uh, us.
Eye of eagle Spleen of lizard You don't need a spell to get me here, darling.
A mother's heart knows when her child needs her.
Mother, to say that you are impossible, willful and exasperating does not begin to express how mad I am.
Thank you.
Did Tabitha make the second grade?
She's more apt to make the cover of Time if you don't take that spell off.
You want me to turn her into a dumb-dumb?
Tabitha is not a dumb-dumb.
She's a normal Who was worried about getting into the second grade.
Oh, the thought of it sickens me.
Mother, I know that deep down, beneath all that mischief, you mean well.
But the mortal world just isn't ready for our kind, and until it is, we want Tabitha to lead a normal life.
So, please, take that spell off.
Very well.
Tabitha, forgive her.
She knows not what she makes me do.
Everything you know From A to Z. I hereby take Away from thee.
You'll know the things A child should know.
But to your grandmamma It's quite a blow.
Well, I'll be going.
Good.
Mrs. Peabody.
Oh, I'm so glad to find you home, Mrs. Stephens.
I want to talk to you about your daughter.
I'm sorry, I'm a little busy, so I'm busy too, Mrs. Stephens.
Busy writing an article about your daughter.
Article?
For the Scholastic Monthly.
One day, Mrs. Stephens, this could be a shrine.
Interesting.
Mrs. Peabody, when you barge in here uninvited, you do a thing more courageous than you think.
Forgive me, Mrs. Stephens.
This is a once-in-a-lifetime thing.
I certainly hope so.
Where is the little genius?
She's out on the patio playing with her little brother, and that is where she is going to stay.
Mrs. Peabody, I thought I made it perfectly clear that I did not want any publicity on Tabitha's so-called talent.
The Scholastic Monthly is hardly LIFE magazine, Mrs. Stephens.
The answer is still no, Mrs. Peabody.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I happen to be busy.
Well, I guess I'll just have to wait until class tomorrow.
Tabitha is under strict orders to answer no questions except those out of the second grade reader.
Good day.
Good day.
Okay, Adam, now catch the ball.
Now throw it to me.
I don't want to play anymore.
Come on, Adam, throw it to me.
No.
Tabitha, help me finish my castle.
That's a dumb-looking castle.
Now that's a castle.
That's impossible.
Hello, Tabitha, is this your little brother?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Peabody.
Yes, this is Adam.
How do you do, Adam?
What a beautiful castle.
Where did it come from?
Oh, it's just something I made up.
How did you make it up?
Please don't ask me, Mrs. Peabody.
I'm not allowed to tell.
Tell what?
That she's a witch.
There's no such thing as witches.
Okay.
Mrs. Peabody.
Tabitha, why don't you take Adam upstairs and play?
Yes, Mommy.
Come on, Adam.
Mrs. Peabody, as a teacher, you should certainly know the meaning of the word "trespassing".
It's a little late for formalities, Mrs. Stephens.
Can you explain where that castle came from?
Yes, I suppose I could if I wanted to, but I don't.
Who are you people?
What are you people?
I don't know what you're talking about.
We're just law-abiding citizens, which, at the moment, is more than I can say for you.
From what planet?
I beg your pardon?
Mrs. Stephens, I've seen your children at play.
Balls floating in the air, blocks turning into castles.
I've stumbled onto something much bigger than a child's IQ.
I'm going straight to the authorities.
If you people are visitors from outer space, I think perhaps the FBI should know about it.
Very well, Mrs. Peabody.
You force me to tell you the truth.
Because if you are going to blab to the authorities, you might as well have your facts straight.
We are not from outer space.
I am a witch.
That's what the little boy said, but you don't expect me to believe that, do you?
Well, it might be a whole lot easier on you if you did.
But I don't.
I know you're from outer space.
Let me put it another way.
You are barking up the wrong tree.
As I said, I am a witch.
You are a witch.
And I am not going to repeat myself, so please take notes.
Oh, yes.
Do you happen to have a pencil?
One pencil, coming up.
How did you do that?
We're not allowed to tell.
I'm not sure I want to know.
You're looking a little pale, Mrs. Peabody.
Would you like some water?
Desperately.
Oh!
I think I've had just about all I can digest for one day.
Mrs. Peabody, I only told you these things because you came snooping around.
And I think it's only fair to warn you that if you tell anyone, well, they'll just think you're You underestimate me, Mrs. Stephens.
I have a reputation for being not only a fine teacher, but a person with sound emotional balance.
Good day.
Good luck.
Well, what do you think?
I'll tell you what I think, Mrs. Peabody.
I think you're ready for a year's sabbatical, maybe a permanent one.
Everything that I've told you is the truth.
She wiggled her nose and put you up in a tree, hm?
Like this: Charming.
You know, you're wasting your talents as a teacher, Mrs. Peabody.
With your imagination, you should be a writer.
You don't believe me, do you?
Mrs. Peabody, may I suggest you take your year's sabbatical at your friendly neighborhood sanitarium?
Mr. Roland, you've always been a fair man.
Do you have the courage to come with me to the Stephens home so that I can prove to you that everything I've told you is fact?
Have you got the number or shall I look it up in the yellow pages under "witches"?
In this situation, a phone call is unwise.
A surprise attack is in order.
Hm.
Sam, I'm home.
Hi.
How'd it go today?
Tabitha make it into the second grade?
Easy.
That's good.
Uh, no, that's bad.
What do you mean?
How would you like a drink?
Eh, Sam.
Just give me the news without the anesthetic.
Well, the good news is that she made it into the second grade.
You told me that.
What about the bad news?
She did especially well in math.
What's so bad about that?
The reason she did well in math is, uh, Mother put a spell on her.
I'll take that drink now.
The spell also included algebra, advanced trigonometry, physics, the complete works of Shakespeare Oh, boy.
I'll I'll get it.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Peabody, Mr. Roland.
How do you do?
I certainly didn't expect to see you two.
Good evening.
As long as you're here, please come in.
Thank you.
Sweetheart, this is Mr. Roland, the principal of the school, and this is Mrs. Peabody, Tabitha's teacher.
I hope one day to be known as Tabitha's biographer.
Uh, how do you do?
Uh, please, sit down.
Thank you.
And, uh, how is Tabitha?
Oh, the little witch is just fine.
Uh, Sam, may I speak to you privately?
Of course.
Would you like a drink?
No, thank you.
No, thank you.
Excuse us.
Sam, have you lost your mind?
Shh.
I have an idea.
Just go along with it.
What's that?
That's our bag of tricks.
Mr. Roland, Mrs. Peabody, excuse us, but I just had to explain to Darrin that I told Mrs. Peabody the truth about us this afternoon.
Would you like a drink, sweetheart?
Uh, yes, thank you.
Coming right up.
See what I mean?
That little number comes in handy if you happen to be passing through a dry state.
May I see that glass, please?
Oh, it's just an ordinary glass.
Well, that one's a little rusty.
She didn't do with rubber bands earlier.
Well, that's correct, Mrs. Peabody.
This afternoon I did it with magic.
Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
Well, I've already told Mrs. Peabody.
I'm a witch, and this is my mortal husband.
Oh, come on, Mrs. Stephens.
All right, I'll prove it to you.
Excuse me.
I have to get something out of this trunk.
Mrs. Peabody, would you come here a moment?
MRS.
I don't believe it.
What sort of a game are you playing?
Well, it's no game.
We need the practice in case vaudeville ever comes back.
Well, why the elaborate hoax on this poor, unfortunate woman?
Just teaching the teacher a lesson.
Mrs. Peabody invaded our privacy.
She just got what people get when they snoop.
Would you like her apology in writing?
Maybe 500 times would be in order.
No, a simple "I'm sorry" will do.
Say you're sorry, Mrs. Peabody.
First, there's something that happened this afternoon that I just don't understand.
One minute we were standing out there talking, and the next minute I was sitting up in that tree.
Well, that seems a little incredible.
Yeah, say you're sorry, Mrs. Peabody.
Sam, how many times have I warned you about doing that tree bit?
Oh, I I know.
I just blew my cool.
Say you're sorry, Mrs. Peabody.
How on earth do you ever do that trick?
If you think that's something, I once saw a magician saw a woman in half.
Now, say you're sorry, Mrs. Peabody.
And how do you explain Tabitha's genius?
Well, explain Einstein's or Beethoven's or Thomas Edison's.
Say you're sorry, Mrs. Peabody.
I'm sorry.
But she's still a witch.
Have a good day, Mr. and Mrs. Stephens.
Come along, Mrs. Peabody.
Good night.
You really are a witch, you know.
You gonna spread the word?
What?
And wind up in a padded cell?
Well, if it's a padded cell for two, who cares?
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Everything go all right at school today?
Oh, just fine.
Except Mrs. Peabody is taking a little vacation.
Uh-oh.
Well, she was due a sabbatical.
They just advanced the date a little.
I could use a little sabbatical myself from your mother and her constant interference.
Sweetheart, I have a terrific surprise for you.
I had a long talk with Mother, and she agreed she shouldn't have interfered.
You mean, Hard-hearted Hannah actually admitted she was wrong?
I told her you wouldn't believe it.
So she agreed to write it 500 times.
You're kidding.
How about that?
Incredible.
Are you sure that's 500 times?
Terrific.
Well, the first 250 promises are always the toughest.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
It's close, but it just misses.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
What time did you get up?
Early.
It seemed like 10 minutes after I went to sleep.
So I decided to take another run on the campaign for the Benson Mattress account.
Honey, you look exhausted.
Is working this hard worth it?
Larry's promised me a healthy bonus if I land this account, and we're gonna spend a carefree week in Bermuda.
Well, that's terrific.
If I land this account.
Something I haven't done much of lately.
Well, you'll think of something.
I know you will.
Let's see what you got.
"You'll stop counting sheep on a Benson Sleep-Ezy Mattress".
"You'll sleep like a king on a Benson Sleep-Ezy Mattress".
"You'll sleep tight as a drum on a Benson's" Well, what's wrong with these ideas?
They're ordinary.
They need some kind of jazzing up.
They need I don't know what they need.
Well, let's see.
What if you had one sheep instead of five?
Then, let's see.
"One sheep is all "you'll have time to count on a Benson Sleep-Ezy mattress".
Not bad, not bad at all.
And in this one you could have a younger version of the man that's asleep bounding out of bed, with a prince's crown, and it could read "You'll sleep like a king and awake like a prince".
Yeah.
Now, this one, here's the drum, let's see.
Over here you could put a fiddle with the notes coming out.
"You'll sleep tight as a drum and awake fit as a fiddle".
Sam, that's great.
I knew I was close, but you zeroed right in on it.
Hold it.
Sam, you didn't Didn't what?
Well, it's very sweet and generous of you, but I don't want that kind of help.
Darrin, there was no witchcraft involved in my ideas.
Then what do you call it?
I call it using my brain.
I do have one, you know.
I understand.
It's only normal for you.
You want me to succeed and Darrin, if you keep this up we're only going to succeed in having a fight.
Well, I don't want to have a fight.
So I better be getting to the office.
Besides, I have to get these roughs to the art department if I want to make that 1:00 meeting with Larry and Benson.
Dumbo's ego's a bit bruised, eh?
Mother, this is one time I can do without your eavesdropping.
Ooh!
I thought you'd left.
I can't bear to stand by and watch that mortal boob cast a shroud over my daughter who should be wearing mantles of moonbeams.
Mother, that's pretty corny.
But true.
Well, I don't blame him for being mad.
He thinks I used witchcraft.
Didn't you?
No!
Well, he should have used your ideas anyway, especially since he's never had one of his own.
He'll land that account on his own, with the bonus that goes with it for our trip to Bermuda.
If you leave him on his own, the closest you'll get to Bermuda will be an onion.
Ha.
It's Benson.
Oh.
Come in, come in, Mr. Benson.
You know Stephens.
Yes.
Yes, Mr. Benson, how are you?
Stephens.
Fine, thank you.
Benson, I promised you the best ideas the business could deliver, and you're about to hear them.
Go ahead, Darrin.
Well, Mr. Stephens, it's obvious you don't sleep on a Benson mattress.
If you did, you wouldn't be yawning.
That's not a yawn, Mr. Benson, he was just popping his ears.
We are on the 32nd floor, you know.
I'm sorry, Larry, but Mr. Benson was right.
No man can be creative unless he has what nature intended.
Eight hours of shuteye on a Benson mattress.
Well, I'll try, anyway.
Heh-heh!
Uh, Mr. Benson?
Here you are, have a seat.
We have, uh, three concepts.
The first one is designed for billboards.
ClichÃ©.
Go ahead, Darrin, show him the next one.
The, uh, next one is designed for magazines.
This will be a full-color double truck.
Too on the nose.
The next one, Darrin.
Quickly.
Uh We plan to use this one for full-page newspaper ads.
It's too direct, too, uh Too simple.
They need a A gimmick.
Interesting.
I was making a similar comment earlier.
Well, if that's all you have to offer, I think I'd better be moving along.
Just a minute, Mr. Benson.
Uh, I I do have some variations on these ideas.
Well?
Well?
I'm waiting.
But they're not fully developed, so I'm not gonna tell you about them.
Darrin, I'm sure Mr. Benson would love to hear the other ideas, and I'd hate to disappoint him.
I'm sorry, Larry, but I just can't.
Stephens, apparently my account is keeping you up.
So, uh, I think I'll be going.
Ah, feel free to nod off at any time.
Right, Mr. Benson.
Uh, Mr. Benson, I'll I'll call you later.
Bye.
Hi, honey.
I'm home.
I'm in here, making us a drink.
Is it a wake or a celebration?
Oh.
If that smile is any indication, you must have had a great day.
"Great" isn't the word, but it worked out fine.
Do you want to tell me now, or do you want to take a nap first?
Well, first of all, I didn't use any of your ideas.
Oh.
The way you left the house this morning, I didn't think you would.
No, sir, not one.
Congratulations, sweetheart, you got the account on your own.
Wrong.
I presented my own ideas and they bombed out.
Darrin, I told you, there was no witchcraft involved in my ideas.
Just because blondes have more fun doesn't make them brainless, you know.
No, I know, sweetheart, but, uh, when you're married to a witch, there's always that possible possibility, and that's enough.
Darrin, you are living proof that a good deed never goes unpunished.
Who said that?
Socrates?
I'm sure you knew him well.
There you go again.
Insinuating about my age.
Just how friendly were you with Socrates?
Not half as friendly as I was with Plato.
Now, there was a brain.
Darrin, I'd like to make a statement.
Yeah.
Are you ready to admit the truth?
Yes.
I'm listening.
Well, the truth is, with you, I'm darned if I do and I'm darned if I don't.
And I'm darned if I don't find your entire attitude revolting.
Okay, forget it.
Good.
Except for one thing.
I'm willing to forgive you.
That's very generous of you, but I don't want to be forgiven for something I didn't do.
However, if I'm going to be stuck with the name, I might as well enjoy the game.
Now, Samantha, cut that out.
I am willing to discuss this whole thing in the flesh.
Excuse me.
I want to change these flowers.
It's not polite to disappear when someone's talking to you.
When someone stops making false accusations and decides to be a responsible person, someone else will stop disappearing.
No.
Sweetheart, I think you're blowing this up way out of proportion.
I mean, it's bad enough having dinner with the Invisible Lady, but this is getting ridiculous.
Don't touch me.
All right, I'll make a deal with you.
Just confess that you used witchcraft, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Really?
Well, I'll make a deal with you.
What's that?
This.
Sorehead!
Thanks for nothing!
Thank you, Mommy.
You're welcome, sweetheart.
Daddy, how come Mommy's invisible?
Because  She doesn't want to face the truth.
Tabitha, tell your father the truth he is referring to is not the whole truth.
It's not even a half-truth.
In fact, it's a lie.
Daddy, Mommy said Tell your mother that if she wants to discuss this face-to-face, I would like to see her face.
Mommy, Daddy said  Tell Daddy when he's ready to apologize, my face will be available.
Daddy, Mommy said  Ask your mother if I could have a cup of coffee.
Tell him to get it himself.
Tell her Never mind, I'll have it at the office.
Goodbye, Tabitha.
Do you want me to kiss Mommy for you, Daddy?
I don't think so, honey.
Something as valuable as kisses shouldn't be wasted on thin air.
Hi, Mommy.
Hi, sweetheart.
You and Daddy had a fight, huh?
I'm afraid we did.
Who won?
Well, it isn't over yet.
But we're both losing.
Everything will be all right, I hope.
Cheers.
Cheers.
Mother, please, if you don't mind, I'd like my dirty dishes back.
I'm just trying to help, my darling.
Trouble still brewing in paradise?
Oh, Mother, Darrin's right, I shouldn't butt in.
And I don't want to discuss it.
I've made arrangements for space on Cloud 9, family plan.
Why don't you pack everybody up and come with me, hm?
Mother, I am not going anywhere.
I am going to stay right here, and when Darrin comes home, I'm gonna tell him that he was right and I was wrong, and from now on, I'm gonna mind my own business.
To err is human, to forgive, divine.
Exactly.
Well, when you're up to here in err and you've turned into one huge lump of divine, don't say Mama didn't warn you.
But if you change your mind, the ambrosia hour on Cloud 9 is from 4 to 8.
Forget it, Mother!
Oh, you'll drive me crazy.
Larry, what are you doing?
You look half dead.
What's wrong?
I didn't get much sleep last night.
I'm too tall for the couch.
You'll get used to it.
I've reached the point where I sleep better on the couch.
And as for what I'm doing, I'm going through your alternate concepts.
They're great.
I know.
"You'll sleep like a king and awake like a prince on a Benson".
"You'll sleep tight as drum and awake fit as a fiddle".
Darrin, these are sensational.
Of course they are.
Now, if I wanted to use those ideas, I could lock up the account like that.
If you wanted to?
Don't you want the sun to rise in the morning?
Don't you want to live to a ripe old age?
Don't you want me to live till tomorrow?
Forget it, Larry, we've already lost Benson.
It's too late.
No, we didn't.
I very wisely arranged to have cocktails with him last night and convinced him to give us another shot.
I knew you'd come through, you son of a gun.
I'm sorry, Larry, but I'm not gonna show Benson these layouts.
Why not?
Well, it wouldn't be fair.
Darrin, have you been drinking?
Not even coffee.
Which is another story.
Look, I don't know what your problem is, but Benson's going to be here any minute, and I'm going to show him these layouts.
Oh, no, you're not, it would be unfair to Benson.
He'd love these ideas.
He'd be powerless not to.
Why, are they laced with black magic?
You guessed it.
Yes?
Mr. Benson is here?
Al?
Already?
Heh!
Well, send him in.
Larry, I am not gonna present these ideas.
You're not, but I am.
Everything in this office is the property of McMann & Tate.
Heh.
Oh, hi, Mr. Benson.
Uh, we were just mulling over a few ideas for you.
It looks more like you were mauling them.
You're not yawning, Mr. Stephens.
I presume you had a good night's sleep.
Excellent.
I was talking to Stephens.
Well, that's all right.
He can speak for me.
I'm his property.
Have a seat, Mr. Benson.
You think I'm gonna be here that long?
Mr. Benson, I've got a feeling that you're going to be very pleasantly surprised.
There you go.
These are just what you're after, Mr. Benson.
Darrin and I pitched in and came up with some real gems.
"One sheep is all you'll have time to count.
Awake like a prince.
Fit as a fiddle".
Well, they, uh, do have something but then they haven't got anything else.
I don't like 'em.
Did you say, "I don't like them"?
Too gimmicky.
Gimmicky?
Yes.
You mean, you have no compulsion to like them?
Are you sure?
Sure I'm sure.
You mean, deep down, you're not fighting the desire to say, "I love them"?
I could learn to hate them if it would make you any happier.
Oh, Mr. Benson, I couldn't be any happier.
Darrin, have you become completely unglued?
No, Larry, you don't understand.
Mr. Benson, I'm eternally in your debt.
Where are you going?
Well, um, I'm taking the rest of the day off.
There's something I've got to do, and I gotta do it now before it's too late.
Mr. Benson, I can't tell you how happy you've made me.
What a day.
Cloud 9 has never been more glorious.
Well, I'm happy to hear that, Mother.
Samantha, while you're waiting for Durwood to come home, why don't you give yourself a treat?
Come on and spend the rest of the day with me on Cloud 9.
The change will do you good.
And who knows, you might get to like it there.
Oh, I don't know, Mother, I'm worried about Darrin.
Oh, you're too protective.
You're his wife, not his nanny, although I suspect a nanny is what he really needs.
Samantha, he's acting churlishly, and you know it.
I guess so.
Where are the children?
Well, Tabitha's in school.
Adam's in the park with Esmeralda.
Perfect, then there's nothing to keep you here.
All right, Mother.
Good.
Maybe the change of atmosphere would help.
Like it?
Mmm.
It's heavenly.
You know, I'd almost forgotten what smog-free air was like.
Sam?
Sam, I'm home!
Are you here, Sam?
I'll even settle for invisible.
Sam, I don't know where you are or if you can hear me, but, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
Sam, I was wrong not to believe you.
I know that you didn't use witchcraft.
All I proved was that I have pride and integrity, and that I'm stupid.
Well, he has something there.
Ta-ta, Mama.
I miss you, and I wish you'd come home.
Please, honey, forgive me, wherever you are.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
Am I glad to see you.
Where have you been?
Not far.
Sam, I'm sorry.
I I should've known you wouldn't lie to me.
That's right, you should've.
I promise I'll never doubt you again.
What made you change your mind?
Well, Larry got ahold of my roughs with your changes on them and pitched them to Benson and, uh And?
Well, Benson didn't like them.
Heh.
Which proves to you that I didn't use witchcraft and which proves to me that you thought I was guilty until I was proven innocent.
Isn't that supposed to work the other way around?
I know I was wrong, but the only important thing is that I love you.
I love you.
Thanks a lot.
I'm sorry, honey.
All marriages have their problems, but for us to be losing sleep over some dumb mattress account is ridiculous.
What did you say?
I said all marriages have problems.
No, no, the The last part.
Uh, um, it's ridiculous for us to be losing sleep over some dumb account.
Yeah, why didn't I think of that before?
What are you talking about?
Are you sure you don't know?
Don't know what?
Never mind.
I've got it.
I've got the answer, and it's perfect.
What's even more, it's inspired.
More than that, you inspired it.
I did?
Yes, you did.
Where are you going?
To see Benson.
But I'll be back before you know it.
I love you, honey.
Don't disappear.
Well, Samantha, you've done it again.
You are wrong, Mother.
I merely inspired the idea.
Darrin found it, which is the way it should be.
I suppose what Durwood doesn't know will never hurt him.
Mother, what difference does it make?
What's a wife for if she can't inspire her husband with occasional witchly wife-craft?
He loved it.
Benson absolutely loved it.
I knew he would the minute I heard you say it.
And Sam, I owe it all to you.
Thank you.
Well, at least three-quarters of it.
I'll take half.
You've got it.
Oops.
Did Larry like it?
He hated it.
Right up until the time that Benson loved it.
Uh, Sam did you really know Plato and Socrates?
Of course not.
I wasn't even born yet.
I always had doubts.
Let's not start that again.
I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I'm getting punchy.
No sleep and all this excitement is getting to me.
I understand.
We'll go to sleep early.
Good.
Oh.
Oh.
Uh, I'll get a towel.
Okay.
I said early, not immediately.
Oh, dear.
Well, a toast to Benson Sleep-Ezy mattresses.
When you're exhausted, a bed of nails is just as good.
Mmm.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
I think I'm going to have the beef soo chow.
Mm, I hear that's marvelous.
Oh, Mr. Fong.
I am honored to have you in my humble place, Mr. Stephens.
And, uh?
My wife, Samantha.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Please sit down.
Thank you.
I'm certainly looking forward to the prospect of handling your advertising.
Yes, let's hope we can bring that about.
Mr. and Mrs. Tate should be here any minute.
Good.
In the meantime, I have a surprise.
This is my masterpiece, and I would like you both to try it, with my compliment.
Well, now we're honored.
Please.
Thank you.
Mm.
That's marvelous.
What in the world is in it?
Sorry, the ingredients are secret.
All but one.
The Himalayan cinnamon stick is very rare.
From a remote area high in the mountains.
I have named my drink after the stick.
The Heavenly Himalayan.
Night after night, I stayed here after closing, trying this formula and that, like a witch over her caldron.
Well, you certainly came up with a bewitching drink.
Thank you.
Thank you.
It's, uh, heavenly, all right.
And heady too, you might say.
Ooh.
Sam, are you all right?
I, uh I I feel a little strange.
The truth is, I feel a lot strange.
Strange?
Dizzy.
Perhaps madam would like to lie down in the office?
Uh, no.
No, I think we'd better leave.
Oh Uh, I am definitely not well.
The Himalayan cocktail is really very mild.
It's never affected any of my customer like that before.
Well, Sam's not like any of your other customers, Mr. Fong.
Caldron, caldron, tell me true.
How you stirred up Such a witches' brew.
We do have to go home.
Yes.
Yes, and the better the sooner.
Would you make our excuses to Mr. and Mrs. Tate?
Yes.
Oh, Mr. Stephens, what's wrong?
Oh, I I wish I knew.
Where am I?
You're home.
Samantha, what's wrong?
Who's she?
It's your Aunt Hagatha.
Oh, so it is.
What's she doing here?
She's sitting for us.
No, she's not.
She's standing for us.
Toot-toot.
Oh, Mr. Stephens, she's sick.
Oh, I don't understand it.
She just had a couple of sips of a drink and got looped.
That's impossible.
Witches aren't subject to such mortal frailties.
Something is radically wrong.
Samantha, should I get in touch with Dr. Bombay?
That quack?
Absolutely not.
Samantha, is he always this difficult?
Relax, sweetheart.
We may not need Dr. Bombay after all.
I'm beginning to feel better.
At least I'm not dizzy anymore.
Do you mind if I try out my witchcraft?
Whether he minds or not doesn't matter.
The only thing I mind is her.
Well, let's see.
Lamp, lamp on yonder table Fly to me if you are able.
Well, now shall I call Dr. Bombay, or are you still in your mortal snit?
Sam!
Great Hector's ghost!
Now what?
Look.
Don't just stand there, get Dr. Bombay.
Oh And I bet you thought you'd grown accustomed to my face.
Darrin, before Aunt Hagatha puts in a call to Dr. Bombay, wouldn't you like to go into the den and work?
Or take a nap?
Or something?
No, thanks.
Well, I know Dr. Bombay isn't one of your favorites.
Among your friends and relatives, I have no favorites.
I guess everything your mother says about him is true.
Shh.
Aunt Hagatha, please.
The spell?
Oh, yes, dear.
Yes, yes.
From Tripoli to Timbuktu.
I beg, I plead I beseech of you.
A moment longer, don't delay.
Dr. Bombay, streak this way.
Hi, there, you called?
Uh, we called, we didn't whistle.
Where's Dr. Bombay?
Bomb's away.
"Bomb's away"?
That's what I call him.
"Bomb" for short.
What, and I'll be sorry I asked, does he call you?
Often.
He calls me Often.
Figures.
Now, look, Miss Often, when will the doctor be back?
Any minute now.
I left him a message.
Now I have to get back.
I'm his receptionist.
I'm very receptive.
Bye, now.
Where is the doctor, I wonder?
Probably out in the cosmos chasing ambulances.
He may be chasing, but not ambulances.
Sorry I was detained, I've been over at the gym wrestling with a problem.
How to come to grips with my new nurse.
That's a problem?
Not really.
I'll pin her down yet.
Dr. Bombay, we do not find your personal peccadilloes the least bit amusing.
You peeked.
Oh, for Pete's sake, will somebody talk some sense into this clown?
I will.
My witchcraft has gone to pot and in case you haven't noticed, my face is covered with red stripes.
Hm.
Interesting.
Very interesting.
Well, doctor, what do you think the matter is?
Obviously, her witchcraft has gone to pot and she's developed red stripes.
I'd hoped you could tell me what disease I have.
Judging by the symptoms, I'd say you had Bright Red Stripes disease.
Is that serious?
Not at all.
Just inconvenient.
It lasts one full year.
Dr. Bombay, you have to do something.
I can't walk around with these stripes for a year.
The disease lasts one full year, unless it's cured within eight hours.
Perhaps I could find an antidote if I knew how you got it.
You haven't been mixing eye of newt with oysters, have you?
No.
Ah, then there's only one other way you could have got it.
Have you been recently on the western slopes of the Himalayas?
Lately, I haven't been any further than a PTA meeting.
The drink.
She had a drink with a Himalayan cinnamon stick.
Ah-ha.
Then that's it.
Eons ago, the Tibetan monks cross-pollinated a rare herb with Himalayan cinnamon and used it to drive the witches out of the Himalayas.
I didn't know there were any witches in the Himalayas.
There aren't.
It worked.
Now, doctor, about the eight-hour deadline?
Never fear, Bombay is here.
I shall feed this information into my ultra-vascular self-denominating powered trichroscope, with, of course, the super-duper diagnostic predictor attachment.
Ah-ha!
There is an antidote.
A simple potion.
You can pick it up from your apothecary.
We start with, uh, eye of condor, powdered snakeskin, fig newts.
Fig newts?
That's the way the cookie crumbles.
One pint of unicorn milk, non-fat.
And a toasted cheese sandwich on rye.
Toasted cheese?
That's for me.
I'm starved.
Hagatha, have the apothecary fill out this prescription, give it to Samantha, and she'll be as right as rain.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I want to try out my new wrestling mat on my nurse.
It's the only one in the universe with "Welcome" on it.
Well, what are you waiting for?
Oh, I refuse to go near that dirty old druggist.
But Samantha, I'd be glad to zap you there.
Thanks a bunch.
Well, maybe my red stripes will turn him off.
Zap away.
Oh, hi, cutie.
Say, them stripes, mm, they really turn me on.
Well, I certainly called that one.
Uh, look, Mr. Druggist, I have a pres Please, don't call me that.
I'm apothecary to the entire cosmos.
Excuse me.
Look, Mr. Apothecary, I have a prescription Yeah, I started out to be a friendly neighborhood druggist, but I couldn't find a friendly neighborhood.
I couldn't find a friendly neighborhood, you get it?
Oh, yes, I get it.
And it's a howler.
But what I really came to get was this prescription filled.
Well, I got this one here ahead of you.
But this is an emergency.
Oh, well, maybe I can hurry things up, if you're willing to consider this a friendly neighborhood.
Uh, not that friendly.
What are you brewing?
It's a love potion, cutie.
Care to share a jigger or two with me?
Oh, uh, no, thanks.
Now, you can have it straight or with a chaser.
What's the chaser?
You're looking at him, cutie.
I need a little potion of my own, on the rocks.
I wish you'd watch where you're going.
I wish you'd watch where you're popping.
No need to get huffy.
I came back because my trusty computer overlooked one ingredient.
But Sam's already gone to the apothecary.
No matter.
The apothecary does not carry the necessary ingredient.
Why?
What is it?
The tail feather of a dodo bird.
A dodo bird?
Why, they're extinct.
Not only that, there haven't been any around for millions of years.
Well, then, how do you expect us to get a dodo bird's tail feather?
How should I know?
I'm a doctor, not a birdwatcher.
Though I will say, a bird in the hand is worth two in the Australian bush.
Take five.
You're too old for all this exercise.
I know, but even at my age I got you!
Ah!
Even at my age, you You fill my veins with the hot blood of youth.
You fill my heart with desire, you fill my brain with passion.
While you're filling up, how about filling this prescription?
Oh, all right.
But first, how's about a little kiss?
How about a nice, friendly handshake?
What's come over this younger generation?
When I was a boy sorcerer, all the witch chicks flocked around me.
Yeah, that was a long time ago.
I'll fill your prescription.
Yeah, when I was a kid "Toasted cheese on rye"?
Now, what's that supposed to cure?
Dr. Bombay.
He's hungry.
Oh, I'm hungry too, but not for any toasted cheese.
You know what I mean?
Yes, I I get your message, but what I would really like is that prescription.
All right.
I got a special on the giant economy size in case you ever get the same disease.
Bite your tongue.
Hm.
Ugh.
How do I look?
Like a dream walking.
Are my stripes gone?
No.
Maybe you'd better pop me home.
I have a pooped popper.
One kiss, honeybun, and then I will.
Well, if that's the going price.
One smackeroo, that's the going price.
Okay.
Going, going Mwah.
Gone.
They just can't keep their lips off of me.
Did you get the potion?
Yes, and it didn't work.
That's because Bombay left out one ingredient.
Oh, terrific.
I know I'll be sorry I asked, but which one?
The tail feather of a dodo bird.
I'm sorry I asked.
Sam!
Now what?
Oh, my stars.
Where's Aunt Hagatha?
Upstairs, checking on Adam.
Sam, where are we gonna find the tail feather of a dodo bird?
Well, I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Aunt Hagatha, I wish you'd talk to the Witches' Council about replacing that quack.
I'll make a note.
Tail feather of a dodo bird.
This is ridiculous.
Wait a minute.
Maybe not.
Aunt Hagatha, for Tabitha's last birthday, Mother gave her a cosmos coloring book.
Now, I think there's a picture of a dodo bird in it.
Why don't you pop upstairs and take a look?
And if there is, zap the bird out of the book.
Of course, Samantha.
What a shame.
What do you mean, "what a shame"?
Well, your Aunt Hagatha's gonna zap a dodo bird out of Tabitha's cosmos coloring book so we can get a tail feather o get rid of your horizontal and vertical red stripes.
Why did you say, "what a shame"?
Well, that's a pretty wild trip.
It's kind of sad I'll never be able to tell anybody about it.
Oh!
Oh, oh!
Get away from me, you dirty old bird!
Mr. Stephens, I suggest you get the tail feather yourself.
I'm not going near that dirty bird.
How am I supposed to get a tail feather out of that thing?
Well, I suppose a rear attack is in order.
That's the part you're after.
Good luck.
Oh Ooh, Sam!
Sam, you'd better get out of sight.
If anyone comes along, I might be able to explain the bird but how would I explain you?
Here, birdie.
Here, birdie, birdie, birdie.
Will you come on down here, you rotten bird?
What's the matter?
What do you make of it?
I don't know.
Is it a bird?
Well, if it's a bird, it's the biggest bird I've ever seen.
Should we get out and investigate?
You get out and investigate, I'm not going anywhere near it.
Maybe we'd better call in.
Good suggestion.
This is Car 953.
Car 953.
Do you read me?
Come in, Car 953.
We're in front of a house on Morning Glory Circle and we want to report a, um  uh Bad suggestion.
You describe it.
MAN : You want to report a what?
Uh, nothing.
It's just something we thought we saw that we realized we didn't see.
What?
Over and out.
Let's go have a beer.
Good suggestion.
Now, listen, you dumb dodo, either you're coming down here or I'm coming up to get you.
Okay, if that's the way you want to play.
I got it.
I got it.
Sweetheart, are you all right?
Oh, yeah.
In fact, if I hadn't have grabbed that bird by the tail, I would have fallen off that roof headfirst.
That dumb bird saved my life.
I knew there was something I didn't like about that bird.
Oh, Hagatha, will you just zap him back into the book?
Thank you for your feather Dodo, dear.
Now, back to the book Get out of here.
Here's looking at you.
Dr. Bombay You're 0 for 2.
Appear at once Or you are through I hope this is important.
I was engaged in a very crucial chess match.
That's what you wear to play chess?
It is when I'm tackling my nurse.
Samantha, you naughty little witch, you haven't taken your potion.
Yes, I have.
And I'm running out of patience.
You and me both.
Doctor, you're a disgrace to your profession.
What profession?
Well, if you're going to harass me, I'll leave.
Oh, now, now, wait a minute.
Lay off him, he's the only one we've got.
Thank you, Samantha.
I don't understand what could have gone wrong.
You followed my directions precisely?
Yes.
That's probably what went wrong.
You've got the tail feather of a dodo bird?
Oh, yes.
And I've got the scars to prove it.
And you followed my directions?
You got the potion, you put in the tail feather, you mixed slowly so as not to bruise the Himalayan cinnamon stick?
You didn't mention the Himalayan cinnamon stick.
Of course I did, it's the most important ingredient.
It's not only essential to the potion, it provides the necessary antitoxin.
You did not say anything about the Himalayan cinnamon stick!
I must have.
You didn't.
Do you have witnesses?
Yes.
In that case, it's obvious I didn't mention it.
And having done so, I shall leave.
There goes one of the great quackpots of all time.
Speaking of time, how much time do we have left?
Well, he said we had eight hours, so that leaves us about an hour.
And Ah Fong's is closed.
I can't get ahold of Mr. Fong.
Sam, I may get arrested for what I'm about to do, but I'm about to do it.
But what about bail?
Bail is set at $150.
Pay the clerk.
It's cheap at twice the price.
I got it.
I got it.
How did you manage?
How?
Oh, it was easy.
I got arrested and posted $150 bail.
What?
But it doesn't matter.
Let's see if it works this time.
Oh, well, okay.
Okay.
Ew.
Excuse us, folks.
We would like to ask you some questions.
Uh, yes, officers?
What's wrong with your face, lady?
My husband wanted to see what I look like in stripes.
What can we do for you?
Well, we saw something on your roof earlier and we'd like to ask you about it.
Oh?
Yes, it was, uh Um Well, it was a pretty big, uh Tell them, Charlie.
Well, it was sort of a Uh Uh There hasn't been anyone on our roof since the TV repairman.
Oh.
Does he have feathers?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him in some time.
Well, what we thought we saw was a pretty strange Um, y Uh Well, Fred here thought it was a bird.
What's so strange about seeing a bird on a roof?
Well, this was no ordinary bird.
No?
No.
No, no, no.
It was more like a Uh Uh Tell them, Fred.
Well, it was a It was a great, big bird.
How big?
Well, you may not believe this, but it was almost as big as a As a As what?
Tell them, Charlie.
Where'd your stripes go?
What stripes?
Now, you were saying, uh, the bird was as big as what?
Oh, nothing, nothing.
No, uh Sorry to bother you.
We didn't see anything.
Right, Fred?
Right, right.
We're sorry for the intrusion.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Hi, this is Elizabeth Montgomery, inviting you to stay tuned for Bewitched.
Sam?
Out here.
What are you doing?
Uh, potting.
I, uh I thought you were gonna sleep late this morning.
Yeah, but I find it hard to sleep in a half-empty bed.
Oh, heh.
Well, I had these pots on my mind Oh, I must look a mess.
Yeah, but what a beautiful mess.
Let's see, now.
There's a nice clean spot.
Let me wash up.
I'll fix you some breakfast.
I haven't got time for breakfast.
I have an 11:00 appointment.
Then I have to stop off and pick up a special surprise I found for you.
What's the occasion?
It's an everyday occasion.
I love you.
Stop.
I'm getting nauseous.
Up here, my darlings.
Endora, must you show up without any warning?
Like the flu?
Durwood, you are very ignorable.
Let's keep it that way.
Mo Oh.
Sweetheart, don't forget that Larry and the Franklins are coming over for dinner tonight.
No, no.
I'll be home early.
I still say you're a beautiful mess.
The bologna in this place could supply a delicatessen for a year.
Mother, if you don't like it, why don't you go someplace where the eavesdropping is better?
The way you lap up that syrup, my darling, it's pathetic.
Why shouldn't I?
Because he's a mortal.
And because when your average mortal starts bringing home presents to his wife, and there's no occasion, believe me, there's been an occasion.
You have a very suspicious mind.
Oh-ho-ho!
Your naivetÃ© is sick-making.
Or are you living on fabrications just as they do?
No, I'm not.
Darrin is not your average mortal.
He doesn't tell lies.
Nonsense, they're all the same.
Every one of them, including your precious Durwood.
Why, I wager Yes?
I just remembered something urgent I have to do.
I won't be long.
Well, take your time.
Oh.
Love is blind.
Oh, well.
Good morning, Betty.
Good morning, Mr. Stephens.
Oh, Betty, I wanna show you a little gift I bought for Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, what's the occasion?
Oh, no occasion.
Just like that?
Aren't you sweet.
She happens to be crazy about unicorns.
Unicorns?
Right.
It's her favorite animal.
Unicorns?
Um, a mythical favorite.
Anyway, I found this in an antique store, and I can't wait to give it to her.
Upon that unicorn I put my spell.
Approach it And the truth you'll tell.
Step back And once again you'll speak.
Those lies so dear To mortals weak I wish my boyfriend were like you.
Especially I wish he were married like you, to me.
Do you know how long we've been engaged?
Eight years.
It's a disgrace.
Oh, it's lovely.
Hm.
Eight years, huh?
Has your boyfriend ever seen you in that dress?
I beg your pardon.
Yes, sir.
That's some tight dress, is what it is.
Uh I-I'm sorry if I'm wearing something that's inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
No, no, uh, not at all.
It's a charming dress, Betty, and I have no right to be so personal.
I don't mind your being personal, Mr. Stephens.
To tell the truth, I wore this dress especially for you.
I hoped it'd get to you.
It's two sizes too small, and I thought it would be nice if you noticed I was a woman, just once.
Mr. Stephens, I I was only kidding, really.
I don't know what made me say that.
Yeah, well, that makes us even.
Mr. Stephens' office.
Yes, sir, I'll I'll ask him.
It's Mr. Tate.
He wants to know if you've come up with anything on the Cora May Sportswear account.
Yes, I've come up with a beautiful case of indigestion.
Uh, hi, Larry.
The answer is no, I haven't come up with a thing.
No, no, no, no, no.
Hear me out.
In view of the fact that you gave everybody else in the office a chance at losing that account before you gave it to me, and considering the fact that I've been on the account for exactly 24 hours, I think you've got a lot of nerve expecting me to perform miracles.
Yes?
Oh, good.
I can tell you this to your face.
You spent a year running the Cora May account into the ground, and And And, uh, uh, no one in my time or memory has ever put up a more valiant struggle to save a sinking ship.
Is this some kind of a joke?
Oh, I knew I could rely on your sense of humor, Larry.
It's a pretty dumb joke, if you ask me.
Yeah, I guess it was.
What's bugging you this morning?
I gave you the sportswear account because I thought it would be a challenge.
And I wanted no part of it.
She's a miserable lady.
I hate doing business with women, anyway.
It's a marginal product, and I have no intention of knocking myself out.
Besides, I'm king of the hill in this agency.
That's the way things are.
Right, Larry.
Sure.
I hope you'll be in a better mood tonight.
Oh, don't worry, I'll be a good boy.
Good.
I didn't really mean all that stuff about the king of the hill.
It's just that, if anyone can land that account, you can.
See you tonight.
I'll, uh, be looking forward to it.
Big shot.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
How do you do, madam?
Do you believe in magic?
Probably not.
But I'm sure you'll agree that anything that makes housecleaning a pleasure has to be magic.
Well, I'm terribly sorry, but Think of what you can do with the time you save.
I tell you, the Mindmaster Vacuum Cleaner is sweeping the country.
"Sweeping the country," get it?
I get it.
Just a minute, buddy.
I was here first.
It's my husband.
Oh, how do you do, sir?
I was just telling the little lady what a great little  What a dog this vacuum cleaner is.
I mean, that's what I should have been telling her.
I take it you're not interested.
Sorry.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
With this dud, I can't seem to win any of them.
What got into him?
Can't imagine.
Well, I suppose there comes a time when a man just can't hack it anymore.
What kind of a kiss do you call that?
A cautious kiss.
I didn't feel like getting a roller in my eye.
Oh, sweetheart, I I'm sorry.
I just finished putting up my hair, when that pest arrived.
Do you mind?
Of course I do.
All men do.
If women just realized how ridiculous and unfeminine they looked with all that hardware in their hair You want me to look pretty, don't you?
Well, look at it this way.
How would you feel if I came tripping down the stairs, with shaving cream all over my face, and offered you my forehead to kiss?
Darrin.
Well, I wouldn't be at my most attractive, would I?
Well, no, you're not right now.
I think his honesty is very refreshing.
Thank you.
If the sight of me is so distressing, I'll just go back upstairs.
Sam.
Endora, there are lots of things I don't need right now, and you're on the top of the list.
Mother, dear?
Hm?
You still find his honesty refreshing?
Mm-hm.
Oh, sweetheart, here's that surprise I told you about this morning.
Oh.
Oh, Darrin, it's beautiful.
Mother, look.
Oh, isn't it lovely?
Who picked it out for you, Durwood?
Oh, oh.
Let's see, it isn't your birthday, it isn't your anniversary.
So there's only one explanation.
Durwood has a guilty conscience.
Oh, Mother.
Stop being yourself.
That's like asking Niagara to fall up.
All right, all right.
Mother, bye-bye.
Earlier, I couldn't help but overhear that you were having a little, uh, dinner party?
So why don't you two run up and get dressed?
I hope you have a lovely evening.
Thank you, Mother.
Don't worry about your mother.
I'll find something to eat, someplace.
Okay, fine.
Darrin, don't make Mother angry.
She's very difficult when she gets angry.
Since when does she have to be angry to be difficult?
You're right, Durweed.
I don't have to be angry to be difficult.
But it helps.
Oh, Darrin, when are you going to learn that Mother knows best?
Hm?
And what Mother knows best is how to be difficult.
Well, so far so good.
It's possible that your mother has come to understand that you cannot mix in-laws with business dinners.
Mm-hm.
It's possible.
It's also possible that it don't rain in Indianapolis in the summertime.
Sam.
Well You talk about women's lib.
Why, to me, it's laughable.
Any woman worth her salt can make it if she has the will and the talent.
Why, I started my own company at the age of 25.
Is that right?
My, that's really impressive.
Ha, ha.
You must be very proud of you wife, Mr. Franklin.
Hm?
Oh, yes, indeed.
She's quite, eh, remarkable.
Thank you, dear.
You're slouching.
Oh, speaking of business, I think you should know that we at McMann & Tate consider Stephens to be our number-one creative talent.
Tate, don't you think you're being a little outrÃ©?
I am?
Where?
I mean, if we're going to discuss business, wouldn't it be more civilized to wait till we've had a drink?
Well, here are the drinks.
Good, ha, ha, ha.
Now we can discuss business.
Here you are, Larry.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, Darrin, do you know what Cora May was telling me?
What?
She started her own company when she was only 25.
Really?
Well, that makes it a very young company.
Oh, ho, ho!
I see your plan, you old fox.
You've assigned the charmer on your staff to my account, haven't you?
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
Don't you try to con me with flattery, because you'll be wasting your time.
I am interested in one thing and one thing only, and that is results.
Right, Walter?
Right, made 25 years of age.
Isn't that remarkable?
You haven't even been listening.
Yes, I have, dear.
What did you say?
I s Here we are.
She comes in beauty Like the night.
Bearing tidbits From Olympian heights  My goodness.
You better save your poetry until you've tasted those.
Speaking of poetry, I had a great idea today for a slogan for my dress line.
I'll give it to you gentlemen, for nothing.
Great, Cora May.
Let's hear it.
Ready?
Heh-heh!
Walter.
Whatever you say, dear.
Well, I haven't said anything yet.
Oh, what's the slogan, Mrs. Franklin?
Well, it goes like this.
Confucius say, "Don't be messy-messy, buy a Cora May dressy-wessy".
Oh, that's cute.
Yeah.
That's great, Cora May.
We'd never have thought of it.
Darrin, make a note of that.
We'd better discuss it at the meeting tomorrow.
Oh, I don't have to make a note of that, because I couldn't possibly forget it.
But, in truth, I must admit, it's very forgettable.
What was that you said?
Well, I mean, "messy-messy," "dressy-wessy".
Heh, heh.
You were kidding, weren't you?
Darrin, you must admit, it's pretty catchy.
Oh, re Relax, Larry.
I know the Cora May account is a pet of yours.
That's the reason you should be truthful.
That's right, Darrin.
Cora May's account is very important to me.
Let's not forget it.
Let's also not forget if anybody laughs at my pet accounts, it's going to be me.
"Dressy-wessy".
Oh, boy.
Larry.
Darrin.
Hey, now, come on, stop clowning around.
Mrs. Franklin's apt to take you seriously.
Stop teasing Mrs. Franklin.
They always do this with a new account.
It's sort of a little game they play.
They must lose quite a few accounts that way.
Uh.
Rarely, rarely.
They're very careful to do it only with a client they know has a terrific sense of humor.
Oh.
Well, that's one thing you can say about me with With no fear of contradiction.
Right, Walter?
You're absolutely right, dear.
A sense of humor has Has always been an important ingredient in my success.
Why, I-I could always laugh at misfortune in those Those grim days when I was pulling myself up the ladder, rung by rung.
I worked my way up in the dress business, until  Why don't you knock it off, Cora May?
What did you say, dear?
You didn't work your way into the dress business.
You were kicked into it, by your father who gave you $25,000 to leave home.
Walter, how can you talk like that?
Easy, dear, because it's the truth.
But But But I have had it up to here, Cora May, with that Horatio Alger bit of yours.
Walter!
Uh, Mrs. Franklin, suppose we get back to business?
A B Yes, I I think business is the only safe subject we can discuss.
Right.
Wrong.
For years I have been clamming up while she sounded off about being the great career woman, playing "I Love Me" on her big fat trombone.
And, Cora May, don't you ever jab me in the ribs again.
Do you have anything else to say, dear?
Yes, something I've been wanting to say for a long time.
When you put "career" in front of "woman," a large part of the woman disappears.
There's more, but that'll do for starters.
Well.
Uh.
I think I'll, uh, check my roast while, uh, Darrin changes the subject.
H Hasn't it been warm?
Lately.
Mother.
I know you're behind this.
I also know what you're trying to prove.
And if it'll make you feel any better, you have proven your point.
You're creating a disaster out there.
"You were right.
Mother knows best.
Message enclosed".
Oh!
"You ain't seen nothing yet".
Mrs. Franklin, I have a great deal of respect for your judgment regarding your advertising, and I'm certainly willing to exchange campaign ideas.
Except when you start throwing around nonsense like "dressy-wessy".
Oh, no.
Darrin, have you gone bananas?
Not at all.
I think a little frankness is a healthy thing.
It's also stupid.
Oh, dear.
I don't think so.
It's time somebody leveled with Cora May.
Oh, boy.
And, Cora May, it's time you listened for a change.
Oh, surely, you don't mean what you're saying, Mr. Franklin.
You never talked to me like that in your whole life.
Well, you never shut up long enough for me to.
You know, they say this kind of a constructive argument is very healthy for a marriage.
Mrs. Franklin, it might be a good idea if you listen to your husband and then to your advertising representatives.
Keep going, my boy, you're making lots of sense.
Never says a word.
All of a sudden, can't shut him up.
Walter, I have waited for years for you to stop being the suffering, silent martyr.
I must say, you picked a beautiful time to turn yourself on.
Well, I am liberated, Cora May.
Mrs. Franklin, I'm not through Darrin, couldn't we discuss this at dinner?
Is dinner ready?
No.
But I thought the dining room might be safer.
I think Samantha's absolutely right.
We should postpone this discussion until  Until right now.
Darrin, there are many ways of handling clients.
And this isn't any of them.
Cora May, we don't tell you how to make your dresses.
And we don't want you telling us how to handle your advertising.
Well, why aren't you laughing, Cora May?
What happened to that sense of humor of yours that got you through those dark days when you were climbing the ladder?
Mrs. Franklin, if you would just leave the creative side of advertising in our capable hands Darrin, why don't you let Larry tell Mrs. Franklin where to get off?
He's the boss.
Sweetheart, would you mind butting out?
Well!
Darrin, you stop picking on your wife.
She's a nice, lovely, charming lady.
Right.
For heaven's sakes, Walter, turn it off.
Where are your manners?
You're a guest in this house.
Oh, Mrs. Franklin, don't worry about that.
I mean I'm not finished yet.
Neither am I. I have a lot to say.
Cora May, why don't you just keep quiet for a change?
Just who do you think you're talking to?
Me.
He was talking to me.
No, I was talking to my wife, and I am not finished yet.
I believe I was doing the talking.
You were, you were.
Please, couldn't I interest anyone in some rare roast pork?
I am going to finished what I have to say Cora May   Darrin?
Oh, excuse me.
What would you like for breakfast?
Dinner.
Well, it's all still in there, and it's not rare anymore.
Forget it.
I wish I could forget the whole evening.
Did you get in touch with your mother?
Mm-hm.
Finally.
And got a confession.
Here's the culprit.
Mother put a truth spell on it.
She wanted to prove that mortals can't stand to tell the truth to one another.
Well, this mortal can stand telling the truth.
Your mother pulled a low, sneaky, mean, underhanded trick.
How's that for the truth?
I'll get it.
Oh, Larry.
Good morning, Samantha.
Lovely dinner.
Well, it's all still out there, if you want some.
Hi, Darrin.
Hi.
I just dropped by to let you know I was practically up all night trying to calm down Cora May and her husband.
With a lot of smooth talk, and a little infighting, I managed to salvage the account.
But I do think you owe her an apology.
Well, Larry, I Darrin.
There's no need for him to apologize.
You'll just have to get along without one.
Maybe I can get along without him at the office too.
Well, Larry, if that's the way you feel, go ahead and try it.
You've got a deal.
That's the worst deal I ever made in my life.
I need you at the office, Darrin, you know that.
I can't get along without you.
Oh, isn't it nice to hear the truth?
What about Mr. and Mrs. Franklin?
Actually, I wasn't up with them last night.
Cora May called me this morning.
It seems that they continued that donnybrook they were having and cleared up a lot of old misunderstandings.
They're happy as larks.
Actually, Larry, everything turned out beautifully.
I guess so.
Heh, heh.
I can't wait to tell Mother.
Mother?
Yeah, she just loves happy endings.
Oh.
Well, I'll see you later at the office, Darrin.
This little fellow really works, doesn't he?
Let me give it a test.
Honey, you're beautiful, sweet, clever, adorable, and I love you madly.
It works.
Well, it doesn't work on me, but I love you.
And that is the truth, the whole truth and et cetera.
