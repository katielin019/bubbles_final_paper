orders.\\nBodecker: The envelope wasn\\'t sealed.\\nWell, my orders were that the envelope wasn\\'t to be sealed.\\n- Can I see your orders?\\n- That\\'s impossible.\\n- Why?\\n- Because my orders are sealed.\\nThis is an odd assignment.\\nWe\\'re to break into this mansion and take a picture of a portrait hanging in the library.\\nOf course.\\nWhere else would they hide a painting except behind a wall safe?\\n- Let\\'s open it.\\n- No.\\nThere\\'s not enough light.\\nI\\'d better use Super-Satchel.\\nThat\\'s terrific!\\nWhat did you call that?\\n- Super-Satchel.\\n- I\\'ll have to order one from CONTROL.\\nNo, don\\'t get it from CONTROL.\\n- They\\'ll rob you blind.\\n- What do I do then?\\nYou\\'d better get it from a discount scientist.\\nNo!\\nDon\\'t do that!\\nYou need gloves.\\nI have gloves.\\nNo, not those kind of gloves.\\nFingerprint gloves.\\nThese are the fingerprints of Kessinger, a KAOS agent.\\nAnything we do, he\\'ll be blamed for.\\nI can\\'t hear the tumblers clicking.\\nI\\'ll try.\\nNo!\\nDon\\'t do that.\\nYou\\'ll leave an ear print.\\nHere, hold this.\\nKessinger\\'s ear.\\nBodecker: She\\'s beautiful.\\nWho is she?\\nMax: Amanda Krispen.\\nOh, yeah.\\nHis estranged wife.\\nShe left him because she was unhappy and went to Pittsburgh.\\nShe couldn\\'t have been that unhappy.\\nThen she took off for parts unknown.\\n- Someone\\'s coming.\\n- I got to take a picture.\\nYou boost me up, then I\\'ll pull you over.\\nGood idea.\\n- I\\'d better get a stronger grip.\\n- Good idea.\\nMy grip is slipping.\\nI\\'d better spit on my hands.\\nGo right ahead.\\nI\\'ll boost you up, then you pull me over.\\nGood idea.\\nYou okay?\\nPerfect, except for one thing.\\n- What?\\n- Next time, that way.\\nBodecker: Hurry!\\nMax: Okay.\\nUpsy-daisy.\\n- Only one of us can make it.\\n- You go.\\n- You go.\\n- You go.\\n- No.\\n- Okay.\\nI\\'ll go, you stay.\\n- And I salute you.\\n- No, there\\'s no time.\\n-  - Hurry!\\nSomeone\\'s coming!\\n-  - Max: Oof!\\nThanks.\\nBodecker, I salute you.\\nWe have got to find those Krispen papers.\\nThey contain the name of every enemy agent of this country-- every politician, every high-ranking army officer, every dentist who owes allegiance to KAOS.\\nYes, well, how do we find them, Chief?\\nKrispen would do anything to get his wife back.\\nWe\\'re going to make a trade-- his wife for the papers.\\nBut we don\\'t have his wife.\\nWe just have that photograph.\\nOh, I think we have more than that, 99.\\nMax, this is why I wanted you to take that picture last night-- to compare with this one.\\nBut, Chief, if you already had a photograph of Amanda Krispen, why did you need another?\\nThose two pictures are not of the same girl.\\nYou\\'re kidding.\\nThat is Amanda Krispen-- that is Mimsi Sage.\\nBut the resemblance is fantastic!\\nMax: Except for the glasses.\\nIt\\'s our plan to have Miss Sage impersonate Amanda Krispen.\\nOf course, she\\'ll have to be trained.\\nShe\\'s not an agent.\\n- What does she do?\\n- We don\\'t have much on her.\\nWe know that she writes children\\'s books.\\nShe wrote \"The Tiger That Couldn\\'t,\" \"The Elephant That Wouldn\\'t\" and \"The Pussy That Would Like To\".\\nWell, do you think we can get her to cooperate with us, Chief?\\nI don\\'t know.\\nI think she\\'ll have to be talked into being a spy.\\nYes, well, I\\'m willing to take a fling at it, Chief.\\n- You start tomorrow.\\n- Couldn\\'t I start this afternoon?\\nNo, Max.\\nI want you to read all of her books, get to know everything you can about her.\\nOh, incidentally, we have information that Gruvnik of KAOS knows about Miss Sage.\\n- He may be after her too.\\n- Gruvnik the Spoiler?\\nBut I thought Gruvnik was with THRUSH.\\nYes, well, he was traded just before the deadline for a rookie killer and two minor-league muggers.\\n- Would you let me go with you, Max?\\n- Uh, no no no no.\\nI\\'ll be perfectly all right, 99.\\nI won\\'t.\\n- Watch your head on that thing, 99.\\nRight.\\n- Hello.\\n- Hello.\\nUh, I\\'m Maxwell Smart.\\nI\\'m a great admirer of your books.\\nOh, that\\'s nice.\\nI\\'ve read everything that you\\'ve written, from \"The Clock That Lost lts Tock\" to \"Happy Hippo Takes A Trip\".\\nYou read \"The Clock That Lost lts Tock\"?\\nHardly anybody read that.\\nOh, I read it.\\nI remember it well.\\n\"Tick and tock lived in a clock, and all day long, the clock would go, \\'tick-tock, tick-tock.\\n\\' then one day, tick and tock had a fight, and tick wouldn\\'t talk to tock, and tock wouldn\\'t talk to tick.\\nSo tick ran away, and then all the clock could do was go, \\'tock, tock, tock\".\\n\\' - You did read it.\\n- Yes.\\nI couldn\\'t put it down.\\n- I was up all night with it.\\n- Well, it\\'s only 12 pages.\\nUh, 12 pages.\\nYes, well There\\'s some very small print there.\\nI reread it many times.\\nWell, would you like for me to autograph a book for you, Mr.-- Mr. Smart?\\nHow about the guest book in my apartment?\\nWhat are you doing for dinner tonight?\\nUm, eating.\\nEating.\\nYes.\\nWell, couldn\\'t we eat together?\\nOh, I\\'m sorry, I can\\'t.\\nI have to watch a mouse tonight.\\n- A mouse?\\n- Yes.\\nYou see, I do my own illustrating, and I have to study the mouse so I can draw it for my new book, \"Seymour, the Psychedelic Mouse\".\\n\"Seymour, the Psychedelic Mouse\".\\nYes.\\nOh.\\nWell, couldn\\'t you do that tomorrow night?\\nOh, no, I rented the mouse for tonight.\\nMiss Sage, I\\'m with the government.\\nWe need your help.\\nThe government?\\nWell, I certainly want to help the government.\\nThat\\'s our government, isn\\'t it?\\nUh, yes.\\nYes, that\\'s our government.\\nI\\'m with the CONTROL agency.\\nYou\\'re a spy!\\nYou\\'re a spy!\\nYou\\'re a spy and you want me to help you!\\n- A spy!\\n- You don\\'t understand.\\nYou see, you\\'re putting me out of business.\\nIf everybody knows that I\\'m a spy, then I\\'m no longer a spy.\\nOh, I\\'m sorry.\\nWhat do you want from me?\\nInformation?\\nWe need your help.\\nIt\\'s vital.\\n- You want me to be a spy?\\n!\\n- Shh!\\nShh!\\nNo, I can\\'t, uh-- I can\\'t be a spy.\\nI-- spies, uh they slink when they walk, and I can\\'t slink.\\nWell, spies don\\'t slink anymore.\\nThat\\'s out.\\nBesides, that\\'s a pretty good \"slunk\".\\nThat\\'s one of the best \"slunks\" I ever saw.\\nOh, I\\'m not cut out for spying.\\nYes, you are.\\nBesides, this assignment may have an effect on the whole security of our nation.\\n- You\\'ve got to help us.\\n- But why me?\\nBecause your country needs you.\\nOh, well, I don\\'t like to get involved with violence.\\nI deplore it.\\nWell, look at children\\'s books.\\nThey\\'re filled with violence.\\nBut that\\'s another kind.\\nThat\\'s friendly violence.\\nThe people who kill each other like each other.\\nOh.\\nYes.\\nWell, look.\\nWhat if I promise to keep you away from anything that\\'s brutal?\\nChief\\'s voice: Gruvnik of KAOS knows about Miss Sage.\\nHe may be after her too.\\nUh, Mimsi, autograph a book for me, and use my full name-- Maxwell.\\nAnd one for my nephew, Montgomery.\\nWell, if you really can, I mean, assure me that there\\'ll be nothing unpleasant or physical-- - I promise you there\\'ll be no violence.\\n- That was \"Montgomery,\" wasn\\'t it?\\nAnd make one out for my Aunt George a-and my uncle, uh-- my Uncle Robert and to anybody else-- This is so different.\\nI never thought I\\'d ever be a-- a you-know-what.\\nI mean, I never, uh-- I never even wanted to be one.\\nEver.\\nMr. Smart, I hate to keep harping on this, but my only concern is that there be no viol-- - What happened?\\n- Oh, nothing.\\nI just picked up a copy of \"War and Peace\" and got involved.\\nUnbeknownst to you, Agent 86, and to your Chief, I have had every phase of the transformation of Miss Sage into Amanda Krispen photographed by secret camera.\\nAre you telling me that you took pictures of us without our knowing it?\\nBut that\\'s dishonest!\\nWhy, that\\'s spying, Chief.\\nThe film has just come over from the lab.\\nI haven\\'t had a chance to see it yet.\\nTherefore, I think that Mr. Smart would be much the better narrator.\\nShall we begin?\\nDoes this movie have a happy ending, Max?\\nDon\\'t worry, Chief.\\nI did everything you\\'d expect me to do.\\nI\\'m sorry to hear that.\\n-  - Run the film, please.\\nMax: That\\'s Mimsi-- uh, Miss Sage.\\nOur first problem was glasses.\\nMimsi wears them, Amanda doesn\\'t.\\nContact lenses were a possibility, but there was always the danger Krispen would detect them.\\nWe decided to see if Mimsi, without glasses, could navigate across the room.\\nWe put some obstacles in her path.\\nShe passes the lamp.\\nShe sees the ashtray on the stand.\\nShe sees the chair.\\nGood.\\nNearly perfect.\\nWe\\'re using contact lenses.\\nMax: As far as Amanda was concerned, doors were an accessory.\\nShe preferred to leap into a car.\\n- After we got out of the hospital-- - Wheelwright: Stop the film!\\nI think it is hopeless to have anyone try to become her.\\nSenator, I think you\\'re making a big mistake.\\nI don\\'t think you should judge by a training film.\\nI think you should judge by results.\\nGentlemen, may I present Miss Amanda Krispen.\\nHow do you do, Senator?\\n- So good to see you again.\\n- Wheelwright: Amazing!\\nIt\\'s a remarkable piece of work, Max.\\nShe certainly is.\\nNow we can go ahead and contact Krispen, exchange your student for the Krispen papers.\\nChief, Krispen\\'s bound to learn that Mimsi isn\\'t Amanda, isn\\'t he?\\n- I imagine so, Max.\\n- Well, what\\'ll happen to her?\\nHe\\'ll kill her, Max.\\nSo you are the Maxwell Smart.\\nYes.\\nI am the Maxwell Smart.\\nSit down, please.\\n- Thank you.\\n-  You\\'re a surprise to me, Mr. Smart.\\nFor a man to have earned your reputation, I would have thought you older.\\nI wasn\\'t prepared for you to be as distinguished as you are, as handsome.\\nBut perhaps I\\'m embarrassing you.\\nOh, no.\\nNo no no no.\\nNo, not at all.\\nWe\\'re trained to deal with the truth.\\nWell, very good.\\nMay I offer you something?\\nA cigarette?\\nOh, thank you.\\nA light, Mr. Smart?\\n- Thank you.\\n- And now perhaps we should get down to the purpose of your visit.\\nYes, I think that would be advisable.\\nAs you know, Mr. Krispen, I came here to talk about Amanda.\\nDo you have Amanda?\\nYes.\\nBut how do I know that after I turn Amanda over to you, you won\\'t kill me?\\nYou don\\'t.\\nBut how do I know that after I give you the Krispen papers, you won\\'t kill me?\\nYou don\\'t.\\nOur safety, it seems, Mr. Smart, is in those \"don\\'ts\".\\nYes.\\nWell, Amanda is in the garden.\\nI\\'ll go and get her.\\nThis way is shorter.\\n- Yes, I know.\\n- You know?\\nUh, yes, well, what I mean is that, uh, you can see the garden through the glass in the window.\\nUh, that is, when the moonlight comes streaming through the curtains, you can see the-- uh, you could see the-- I\\'ll go get her.\\nWell, Mimsi, this is it.\\nBig moment.\\nOh, Max, I\\'m so nervous.\\nMy stomach feels all funny inside.\\nTh-they say in the theater it\\'s good to be nervous before you go on.\\nIs that all right in the spy business?\\nMax, I\\'m going to miss you.\\nI mean, now that the training is over, I\\'m going to miss you-- I\\'m going to miss working with you.\\nOh, listen to me.\\nI sound like I\\'ve had a drink.\\nWhenever I have even a little sip, I just say whatever I\\'m thinking, whatever\\'s on my mind.\\nOh, Max, I\\'m so nervous!\\nNow, just take it easy, Mimsi.\\nEverything is gonna be fine.\\n- I know you\\'re gonna be great.\\n- Honest?\\nHonest.\\nI sound like a character in one of my books.\\n- Shall we go?\\n- I won\\'t let you down.\\nMax\\'s voice: What happens when he finds out Mimsi isn\\'t Amanda?\\nChief\\'s voice: He\\'ll kill her, Max.\\nMax: Well, Krispen, here\\'s your wife.\\n- Hello, Kinsey.\\n- Amanda, darling.\\nAnd now, Krispen, if you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll take your papers.\\nIn a moment.\\nCertainly an occasion such as this deserves-- no, demands-- commemoration.\\nYour favorite, my dear.\\nHold it!\\nNo drinking!\\nUh, what I mean is that, uh, I\\'m not allowed to drink-- you see, I\\'m on duty.\\nGood.\\nThere\\'ll be that much more left for us, right, Amanda?\\n- No-- yes.\\n- The only woman I\\'ve ever known who can consume champagne as though it were bottled water.\\nTo us.\\nI don\\'t need it, Kinsey.\\nI\\'m drunk with the pleasure of seeing you.\\nAh, that\\'s not a bit like you, Amanda.\\nYou\\'re not one to pass up Dom Perignon \\'59.\\nTo the summers of our life.\\nMimsi\\'s voice: Just one little sip, and I can\\'t stop drinking.\\nKrispen, the papers.\\nAh, yes.\\nThe papers.\\nMax: Very ingenious.\\nMimsi, are you all right?\\nYou\\'re cute, you know that?\\nYou\\'re very cute.\\n- Stop that, Mimsi!\\n- It\\'s your eyes.\\nThey\\'re very sexy when you can find them.\\nMimsi, will you cut that out?\\nIt\\'s ironic, my dear, that these very papers you covet will be the instrument with which I shall once again have-- Krispen, I\\'m running out of time and patience.\\nMimsi, will you stop it?\\nLeave me alone!\\nNow, just let\\'s sit down.\\nIt may be hard for you to believe, Mr. Smart, that the delicate creature before you is actually a woman obsessed with a desire for power.\\nShe wanted these papers so that she could control KAOS.\\nWell, here\\'s the key.\\nAh, the key.\\nWhat key?\\n- The key to the statue Zeus.\\n- Oh, that key.\\nYes, that\\'s where I keep the papers.\\nIsn\\'t it appropriate that Zeus should deliver you your precious papers?\\n- I\\'ll have those papers, Kinsey.\\n- Mimsi!\\nDon\\'t move, Smart.\\n- Mimsi!\\n- No, Mr. Smart, not Mimsi.\\nNot now or ever Mimsi.\\n- \"Mimsi\"?\\n- Yes, Mimsi.\\nStay where you are or I\\'ll kill you.\\nYou see, you were the only way I could get those papers from my husband.\\nIt would have been so much simpler if you\\'d just given them to me in the first place.\\nVery well thought out, Amanda, but one slight miscalculation, as there always is.\\nBehind you is my man, Gelson.\\nI see no purpose in keeping you alive any longer, Mr. Smart.\\nJust a moment.\\nYou\\'ve made one slight miscalculation yourself.\\nIf you\\'ll glance over my shoulder, you\\'ll see a statue of Aphrodite, which is not really a statue of Aphrodite but our own CONTROL Agent 99.\\nWell, very good, but Pluto behind your Aphrodite is my man, Bagel.\\nSo you see, Mr. Smart, you are in the hands of our guards.\\nBut only temporarily.\\nBecause behind your Pluto are Karvelas and Szathmary, two of our best CONTROL agents.\\nI\\'ve run out of statues.\\nYes, well, I haven\\'t, and I still have Bacchus, who happens to be the Chief of CONTROL.\\nKarvelas, Szathmary, take them downtown.\\nAnd turn in those costumes before midnight, or we\\'ll be charged double.\\nAll right, Max, now, can we get inside?\\nI\\'m cold!\\nSay, you know, you\\'ve got nice legs, Chief.\\n- Max!\\n- Especially the right one.\\n'"

doing.\\nSee, I think she stumbled onto something.\\n- Sounds like something big.\\n- I'll go see what it is.\\nCongratulations, Ophelia.\\nWhat happened?\\nI discovered that if I mixed the blue stuff with the green stuff Well, science is definitely out.\\nBut don't worry, we'll think of something.\\nThere's no hope for me.\\n'Tis the last rose of summer That is blooming all alone That is exquisite, unbelievable.\\nIt's this room.\\nThis room of art and beauty.\\nOphelia, we've found your career.\\nYou could be an opera singer.\\nMe, an opera singer?\\n- Well, you'll have to put on a little weight.\\n- Oh, I will, I will.\\nYes, your voice will need a little polishing and I know just the right little polish.\\n- Cousin Itt.\\n- Exactly, I'll go find him.\\nOh, Cousin Itt.\\n- Morticia, I have wonderful news.\\n- What is it, dear?\\nOphelia is on a threshold of a new career.\\nI know, she told me all about it.\\nIsn't it exciting?\\nCertainly is.\\nCousin Itt!\\nItt, now you come down here this minute.\\nPlayful and sneaky, too.\\nMy dear, would you mind giving it a try?\\nCousin Itt, it's an emergency.\\nNo, Cousin Itt, the house isn't on fire.\\nBut we do have another emergency.\\nOphelia wants to learn how to sing.\\nWait.\\nWe need you.\\nGomez, darling, are you sure Cousin Itt is our man?\\nHe spent 15 years at the West African Institute for Music.\\n- Teaching?\\n- Supplying hair for violin bows.\\nOh, well, in that case, Cousin Itt, what do you think sister Ophelia's chances are?\\nCertainly, you have an opinion?\\nWith lots of hard work.\\nAnd serious intense study.\\nThat's your considered opinion?\\nWell, at least there's hope.\\nAnd a true artist lives on hope, as long as he has a strong constitution.\\nWe'll start immediately.\\nI'll have Lurch accompany Ophelia.\\nOh, dear, this one's out of order.\\nNo problem.\\nYou rang?\\nLurch, how would you like to be Ophelia's accompanist?\\nDear Lurch, he's such an enthusiast.\\nCousin Itt, take over.\\nDarling, I think we should leave the music lovers alone.\\nLurch will get Ophelia.\\nLet's go to the playroom and read.\\nI've got a better idea.\\nLet's go to the playroom and play.\\n- Hang onto these.\\n- Thank you, darling.\\nNow, it's really quite simple.\\nWhen Fester blows the whistle, play starts.\\nThe first player to get the puck to the opposite wall scores.\\nOh, but darling, isn't this supposed to be played on the ice?\\n- That's too slippery.\\n- Very sensible.\\n- All right, you two.\\nAre you ready?\\n- Ready.\\nGomez, darling, I do believe he's trying to tell us something.\\nCome now, Fester, speak up.\\nOh, now, Fester, you can speak more clearly than that.\\nOh, my, Ophelia upstairs studying opera, and now this.\\nWe're getting to be quite a musical family.\\nEither that or he swallowed his whistle.\\nUncle Fester, I've warned you about those between-meal snacks.\\nQuerida, how many calories in a whistle?\\nWell, are you ready?\\nNow, back to the game.\\nGomez, darling, don't you think we should check on Ophelia?\\nCousin Itt must have her singing like a bird now.\\n- A canary?\\n- A vulture.\\nDreamer!\\nWe couldn't stand the suspense any longer.\\nHow goes it with our little songbird?\\nDear Cousin Itt, he's taught me everything he knows.\\nEven more?\\nGenerous to a fault.\\nWell, fire away.\\nBy george, he has taught her everything he knows.\\nDown to the last But, Cousin Itt, in opera, don't they sing in Italian?\\nThat was Italian?\\nReally temperamental, those long hairs.\\nOh, dear, just as my career was blossoming, it's nipped in the bud.\\nNot yet, Ophelia dear, we'll get you another teacher.\\nI know just the man, Ophelia.\\nSignor Bellini.\\nDarling, are you sure he's available for house calls?\\nQuerida, Signor Bellini is an artist.\\nAnd artists are always ready to sacrifice for art, if the price is right.\\nLet's see how much money we have on hand.\\nYou rang?\\nNow that's what I call functional art.\\nWe're out of petty cash, Lurch.\\nIn the barrel, please.\\nThank you, Lurch.\\nMore in ice-box.\\nGood thinking.\\nThere's nothing like cold cash.\\nStop.\\nStop, stop!\\nIs something wrong, Signor Bellini?\\nNo, except that in my 20 years of coaching the greats, near greats and even ingrates, I have never heard such squawking, squeaking and screeching from a human throat.\\nI have a feeling Signor Bellini isn't too impressed.\\nNonsense.\\nThese maestros only abuse the students they love.\\nShall we try it again, maestro?\\nWho cares?\\nI've already got ulcers.\\nIs that better, signor?\\nWould you like me to show you just how much better?\\nYes, Signor Bellini, yes.\\nTemper.\\nYou're right.\\nI could have broken a perfectly good cane.\\nHe's really a taskmaster.\\nHe's trying to bring Ophelia out.\\nIf he ever hits her, they'll have to carry her out.\\nSignorina Frump, I can't take anymore today.\\nTomorrow I come back for another fee Lesson.\\n- Just practice.\\n- Which part shall I practice?\\nSing them all.\\nAll at once, for all I care.\\nOh, you mean like this?\\nCould you do that again?\\nOr didn't I hear what I heard?\\nOh, joy to the world, I have charmed my maestro with my simple triple-stop, double-vibrato vocal harmonium.\\nA musical miracle.\\nIt's amazing.\\nBeneath all that mediocrity she has hidden talent.\\nPerhaps we can bring it out.\\nIf she is willing to work, and you're willing to pay.\\nWe'll pay anything.\\nWhat does she have to do?\\nFirst, she must empty her mind of everything.\\nThat should be no problem.\\n- She must sing day and night.\\n- Day and night?\\n- Night and day.\\n- Oh, that one she knows.\\nStarting with scales, she must work five hours a day.\\nIf she cuts out meals and sleep, she can work 25 hours a day.\\nGomez, darling, aren't there only 24 hours in a day?\\nBy george, you're right.\\nShe'll just have to sing faster.\\nIn three months I'll have her ready to audition.\\nBetter make it six.\\nMorticia, that's French.\\n- Gomez, darling, we have a guest.\\n- Oh, pardon me.\\nYou rang?\\nLurch, would you please show Mr. Bellini the door.\\nBut I'm not ready to go.\\nAll right, I'm ready.\\nI want you also to work on her tremolo.\\nOh, we will, we will.\\nI'll put her on a strict diet.\\nDarling, what an exciting six months it's been.\\nAnd in a few moments, our Ophelia will be auditioning for the great impresario Rudolpho himself.\\nThat reminds me, Uncle Fester, how's Ophelia's throat spray coming?\\nI think it needs a little splash of ammonia.\\nThe color is getting good.\\nIt is sort of a bilious fuchsia.\\n- There, I think it's done.\\n- Well, we'll know in a moment.\\n- It's perfect.\\n- Well, got to get it while it's hot.\\nThere you are.\\nSinger's Squirt No.\\n5.\\nThank you, Uncle Fester.\\nWhen we spray Ophelia's throat with this, she'll sing like she never sang before.\\nThat must be Signor Bellini and the great Rudolpho.\\nQuick, Uncle Fester, go upstairs and spray Ophelia.\\nSignor Bellini and impresario Rudolpho.\\nOh, charming, we've heard so much about you.\\nYes, I've heard quite a bit about you, too.\\nAnd until today I didn't believe it.\\nLet's get on with the audition.\\nWhat a voice you're going to hear.\\nJust one moment, Bellini.\\nImpresario, Gomez Addams here.\\nNow before we bring on the little lady, there are few details of contract to be settled.\\nFirst, she's to have star billing.\\nStar billing?\\nBut I haven't even heard her yet.\\nExactly, we can't take any chances.\\n- We want to see Ophelia's name in lights.\\n- In lights?\\nUncle Fester will supply the electricity.\\nHe can make it flicker.\\nNow, as to money, salary, we're prepared to start modestly.\\n$10,000 a week plus 90% of the gross.\\nAnd, of course, free tickets for every member of the family at all performances.\\nGet the girl and let her sing.\\nIn due time, Bellini.\\nJust one more detail to settle.\\nImpresario, we don't want Ophelia doing any of those tired, old operas by Wagner, Puccini, Verdi.\\nYou see, we feel that a new singer should have a new opera.\\nExactly, and with this in mind, my dear Morticia has composed one.\\nIt's a frothy little item entitled Afternoon In A Swamp.\\nBellini, if ever I get out of here alive, you won't be.\\nThing, may I please have the contracts?\\nThank you.\\nNow, if you'll just sign the contract.\\nSignor Gomez, I will not sign anything.\\nVery well, a handshake is good enough.\\nPlease, humor him.\\nShake hands.\\nHere comes my dear sister, Ophelia.\\nGentlemen, please be seated.\\nPlay, Signor Lurch.\\nThis is unbelievable.\\nWhat have you done to her?\\nIsn't he the modest one?\\nIt's all Signor Bellini's doing.\\nAll we did was spray her throat with Uncle Fester's special atomizer.\\nYou fools!\\nYou have melted the nodes on her vocal chord.\\nBellini, you are barred from my opera house.\\nEven with a ticket.\\nImpresario Rudolpho, you haven't heard my wife's opera.\\nFor that I am grateful.\\nThe prejudice against new music.\\nAt least you could hear the finale.\\nIt's truly inspiring.\\nAs the dancers glide through the quicksand, the chorus swells triumphantly.\\nAnd the prima donna sings that lovely aria, Afternoon In A Swamp.\\nLeft him speechless.\\nI knew it would get him.\\nHello.\\nOphelia Frump?\\nJust a minute, I'll see if she That's me.\\nThrockmorton, lover, angel, where are you?\\nIn hiding.\\nYes, of course.\\nBye, bye lover.\\nI'm sorry.\\nI cannot join the opera.\\nYou can't?\\nOh, my dear young lady, this has been a red-letter day for music.\\nAnd as for An Afternoon In A Swamp, this has certainly been one.\\nI'm sorry, Signor Bellini, but a woman must place love before her career.\\nForget it.\\nI'm just going to take a long walk, against the traffic lights.\\nWhat's all this about love and career?\\nThrockmorton wants me back.\\nHe says he's sure now that we can be completely compatible.\\nOh, what happened?\\n- He took up judo.\\n- Judo?\\nThis.\\n- How're we doing?\\n- Perfect score, dear.\\nYou've missed 100 out of 100.\\nThe mail's in.\\nThank you, Thing.\\nGomez, darling, it's from the Canary Islands.\\nStrange, we don't know any canaries.\\n- Oh, it's from my sister Ophelia.\\n- I wonder what she says.\\nOh, she says it was all off between her and Throckmorton - from the very first moment they met.\\n- From the very first moment they met?\\nHe dislocated his shoulder.\\nBut she says she's happy.\\nShe's regained her two-part voice and it's lovelier than ever.\\n- She even sent us a record.\\n- Well, let's give it a listen.\\nOh, I'm falling in love By george, she's done it again.\\nI must write to her immediately.\\nI have a lovely idea for her next record.\\nWhat, cara mia?\\nThe Sextet from Lucia.\\n\""
