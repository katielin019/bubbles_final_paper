{START OF EPISODE 01}
Mother, I'd rather do it myself.
Stop talking like a dreary housewife and give your mama a kiss.
My.
Aren't we in a mellow mood this afternoon.
- How's Darrin?
- Who?
Your husband.
Remember him?
That's the first time you've gotten his name right.
Well, I've been thinking.
If I have to be saddled with a mortal for a son-in-law I suppose he's as good as any.
Now, this is for you, darling.
I brought it from Paris, fighting headwinds all the way.
- It's a wedding present.
- Whose?
Yours, of course, darling.
Belated, but sincere.
Let's see how it looks on.
- It's cute.
- Wait until you see the rest of them.
- I brought a dozen.
- Mother!
Honey, I'm home!
Back in the box.
Oh, my stars!
See what happens when you get out of training?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Endora, when did you swoop in?
Sweetheart, I have good news.
- Mother just stopped by to - What's that?
It's a present from Mother.
- What for?
- It's a wedding gift.
We were married five years ago.
Well, I wasn't sure it would take.
I mean, why waste a perfectly good spell on a bad marriage?
That's just what I mean.
We agreed not to have any witchcraft around here.
We don't want anything that you conjured up out of Out of eels' eyes and bats' wings.
- Bats' wings?
- Eels' eyes?
One more remark like that and you'll get down on your four knees and apologise.
Sweetheart, I really think Mother deserves - His four knees?
- He will be a billy goat.
Oh, well, now, now, wait a minute.
Let's not get carried away.
Try to understand, sweetheart.
Mother brought a gift.
Now, people give gifts the way they know how and in Mother's - Oh, stop it, Samantha!
I don't need anyone to plead my case.
Now, are you satisfied?
Please try and understand why I feel this way.
Oh, I understand perfectly.
Yes, you're a small, small man and I think it's just about time you realized it.
Just once, I wish she'd leave a room in the normal way.
I've never seen Mother quite so upset.
She'll get over it.
I wouldn't make any bets on that.
What can she do to me?
The possibilities are endless.
- Endless?
- Well, let me put it this way: Mother's bite is a lot worse than her bark.
Sam, there's nothing to apologise for.
I know we don't agree on this, but you'll just have to go along with me.
Darrin, are you sure you're feeling all right?
Honey, will you please stop worrying.
Endora's probably forgotten the whole thing by now.
Oh, I don't know.
One thing about Mother, she never forgets a grudge.
I half expected to wake up this morning and find myself married to a billy goat.
Nope.
I think Endora understands my position and Hey!
What did the laundry do to my shirt?
What's the matter with it?
The collar's too big.
They stretched it.
That doesn't sound like our laundry.
Their specialties are over-starching and shrinking.
Well, I haven't got time to change it now.
Goodbye.
Take good care of yourself, huh?
Look, as soon as I start to sprout horns and a goatee l'll give you a I know you're up to something.
- Hi, Darrin.
- Hi, Larry.
- How's the layout coming?
- Should be ready by tomorrow.
This should give you a rough idea.
Oh, looks pretty good to me.
Perhaps, we should - What's the matter?
- It's nothing.
I thought I'd set up a meeting with the client, show them these sketches Larry, why are you staring at me like that?
- Darrin, how tall are you?
- Six feet, one inch.
Why?
Well, that's strange.
I'm 6'1 ".
- Small world.
Now, if the client - We're the same height.
- So?
- So, why does your head only come up to my eyes?
You must be taller than you think.
Darrin, you look beat.
Why don't you knock off for the day?
Thanks, Lar.
I am kind of bushed.
I'll get a good night's sleep tonight and then - Laundry.
- What?
The laundry made a mistake with my shirts.
- I see.
- Losing weight?
- What?
I think you're right, Darrin.
You do need a good night's rest.
Maybe you should even Darrin, were you feeling okay when you got dressed this morning?
What?
Why don't you take a couple of days off?
You've been working hard.
I can fill in for you.
It'll be no problem at all.
There you go.
Darrin, either you have a lousy tailor or you're shrinking.
I gotta get home.
Mr. Stephens, would you sign these letters before you I haven't got time.
I've gotta drive home while my feet can still reach the pedals.
That's peculiar.
- Abner!
- What is it now?
Mr. Stephens is only four feet tall.
Samantha!
Oh, Mother shouldn't have done that.
Don't just stand there!
Do something!
- What?
- Make me grow!
Sweetheart, I can't.
What do you mean?
You're a witch, aren't you?
Darling, you know I can't undo Mother's spell.
Oh, sorry.
How stupid of me to forget.
Now, now, sweetheart, just try and stay calm.
Calm?
I shrunk six inches in a crowded elevator.
How am I gonna get back to normal?
Well, you'll just have to apologise to Mother.
For what?
For daring to stand up to her?
For having a difference of opinion?
Darrin, you're really in no position to debate the issue.
She had no right to do this to me.
What difference does it make who's right and who's wrong?
You're only four feet tall.
Where I come from, a man is measured by his principles, not by his height.
- Darrin.
- No!
You listen to me.
If I give up on this l'll be giving up the right to express my opinion in my own house.
No!
I will not be bullied, not by Endora or anyone else.
I will not compromise my principles.
I hate to say this but your speech would be a lot more effective if you were just a teeny bit taller.
I am only four feet tall, but at least I'm my own man and I'll win out over Endora because she doesn't frighten me a bit.
I can take anything she can hand out.
I hope so.
Ready for your coffee, sweetheart?
No cream, I'm on a diet.
You're being ridiculous, Gladys.
Nobody shrinks two feet in one day.
I saw it with my own two eyes.
You will too.
What are you gonna do?
Knock at the door and ask to see the house midget?
Of course not.
I lay awake all night thinking of a plan to get in there.
I tried to reach Mother.
She's being stubborn.
And I called Larry, told him you wouldn't be in today.
I just said you weren't yourself.
Boy, that's the biggest understatement of the year.
Darrin, are you sure you're warm enough in that handkerchief?
Well, it is a bit drafty.
That's something I can fix.
Thanks, honey.
I thought the vertical stripes would give you more height.
Sam, I appreciate you standing behind me like this.
Well, it's all part of the bargain.
- Bargain?
- You know.
"For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer for taller, for shorter".
Sorry.
I'll get that.
Don't go away.
- Where do you think I'm going?
- Oh, you little dickens.
- Hi, there.
- Hi, there.
Our dog got into your backyard by mistake so we came to get him.
Oh?
Well, I didn't even know you had a dog.
Oh, we just got him.
He was taking us for a walk and he got off the leash.
We noticed Mr. Stephens didn't go to work this morning.
Nothing wrong, I hope.
Oh, no.
No, he just didn't feel up to it.
Thanks for asking though.
Funny he should get sick.
I mean, he looked so healthy.
- And tall.
- Gladys.
I'd like to ask you to stay for coffee but I really can't.
I'm awfully busy.
As a matter of fact I was just on my way out to pick something up for Mr. Stephens.
Sure.
We understand.
Darrin?
Darrin, where are you?
- He's not here.
- Who isn't here?
Your dog, of course.
Abner!
- What is it, Gladys?
- Your dog's gone.
I said he was in the backyard, Mrs. Stephens.
He's probably gone on a scavenger hunt.
No matter what we feed him, he always wants more.
This dog will eat anything that's not nailed down.
Sam!
Sam!
Samantha, help!
This is the last load this morning, Sam.
We'll take this stuff to the dump, then knock off for lunch.
All right, you take the crate.
I'll take this stuff over here.
- Sam!
- Yeah, what do you want?
I didn't say nothing, Sam.
No?
Mother?
Mother, I'll give you just three seconds to appear before me.
One, two, three.
You have done some terrible things in your time but, this time, you have gone too far.
I thought he needed cutting down to size.
Mother, you make the Wicked Witch of the West look like Shirley Temple.
Oh, well, all right.
Perhaps I did get carried away but he had no right to behave so childishly.
Where is he?
I'll change him back.
You see, that's just the trouble.
I don't know where he is!
It's even possible that a dog ate him.
Oh!
How positively amusing.
- Mother!
- Oh, all right.
I know how upsetting it is to misplace a husband.
Try not to panic.
Suppose he's had some terrible accident?
Did you look in the garbage disposal?
- Mother, please!
- Well, it's just a thought.
Oh, Durwood!
Durwood!
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
- I can explain all this.
- A leprechaun.
I found a leprechaun in a bottle.
- Don't get upset.
- Who's upset?
It's a nice change from them darn snakes.
Will you help me out of here?
Not until you give me my three wishes.
But I can't do that.
Look, Mr. Leprechaun, I'm a fair man.
Now, you give me my three wishes, and we're even-steven.
I give you my word as a gentleman.
Oh, I believe you, but it's not as easy as that.
On the other hand if I don't get my just rewards, I'll squash you with my boot.
All right!
All right!
Take me to 1164 Morning Glory Circle and then we'll see what we can do.
Fair enough.
Come on, little fella.
Come on.
Hello, are you Mrs. Leprechaun?
- I beg your pardon?
- I've got your husband in my pocket.
You have?
Not so fast.
We've some business to discuss first.
A matter of three wishes.
Is he hurt?
Oh, please, let me see him.
Well, all right.
You can look, but don't touch.
- Cut little fella, isn't he?
- Darrin, are you all right?
Just give him his three wishes, Sam.
You promise you'll let me have my husband back?
Frank O'Hara never welshed on a deal in his life.
All right, Mr. O'Hara.
What do you want?
For my first wish, I'd like a new pair of specs.
Horned rims with gold screws.
One pair of spectacles coming up.
That's wonderful.
Say, you're pretty.
Good-looking wife you got there, little fella.
Get on with it, will you?
It's hot in here.
Spunky little fella, isn't he?
For my second wish l'd like a new set of duds with a purple waistcoat.
Got you, Mr. O'Hara.
- How do you do that?
- What?
Wiggle your nose like that.
Real cute.
It's a trade secret.
You have one wish left.
I'd like a Shetland pony.
A Shetland pony?
Aren't you a little old for that?
Sam, don't try to psychoanalyze him.
Just give him his pony.
Ever since I was a little kid I wanted a Shetland pony, more than anything else in the world.
And when I didn't get it, I felt shunned by my fellow man.
I became a pitiful outcast.
Just because I didn't get my pony, I was a mess.
Sam, give him his pony!
I certainly like the way you do that.
If you look in the driveway you'll find your third wish.
If someone would have done that for me when I was a little boy it would've saved a wasted life.
Wait until I tell the boys down at the mission house.
Well, you gave me my three wishes.
Here's your husband.
Just like that?
Don't you wanna know where all the things came from?
Why should I?
I look upon these things as gifts.
Now, you don't ask where a gift comes from now, do you, little fella?
L I suppose not.
Well, bye-bye, Mrs. Leprechaun.
Goodbye, Mr. O'Hara, and good luck.
Before I go, I'd like to say one thing.
What's that?
You two make a very cute couple.
- There, that's better.
- Know something, Sam?
For the first time, I feel very small.
It takes a big man to admit his mistakes, sweetheart.
That drunk was right.
The truth is if anyone else gave you a wedding present I wouldn't ask how they got it or if it was hot or Sam, I'd like to say I'm sorry to Endora.
- Can you call her?
- As a matter of fact, she's here.
She's been helping me search the house for you.
Mother!
Mother?
- Figures.
- Mother!
Mother!
You didn't have to shout, Samantha.
- I'm not deaf.
- Where were you?
If you hadn't shouted, I would've come right away.
Mother, Darrin has something to say to you.
Oh, my, my!
I did quite a job on him, didn't I?
May I say something?
Of course, this wouldn't have happened if he wasn't so bigoted and unreasonable.
- Look, if you don't listen to me, I'll - Yes, what will you do?
Punch me in the knee?
Endora, sometimes you're impossible.
I just wanted to say, "I'm sorry.
I was wrong".
Why on earth didn't you say that before?
Thank you, Mother.
Nice to have you back with the grownups, sweetheart.
Nice to be back.
Mother, now that Darrin has apologized I think that you owe him an apology.
Oh, very well.
I regret my slight transgression of the other day but only because my daughter insists.
- That's an apology?
- For Mother it is.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to India to meditate with a guru.
"I regret my slight transgression of the other day" Darrin.
Darrin, please.
Don't worry about her.
Just remember, in the words of Frank O'Hara we make a very cute couple.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Anybody home?
"Darling, Tabitha and I have gone to the" Cousin Samantha and Tabitha have gone to the store.
Let me out.
Let me out.
Quiet, you wretch.
Sam?
Yes, sweetheart.
Would you fix me an omelette?
I'm hungry.
I' II be right down.
Oh, this is going to be a riot.
Honey?
Boy, am I starved.
What was that for?
You said you were starved.
Serena, what a lovely surprise!
Is that Serena?
How would you like to come to a neck-wringing party?
I forgot my grocery list.
Now I'm glad I did.
Drat and double drat.
Darrin.
Aren't you gonna be late for your golf game?
With her here, I think I'd better stay close to the house.
- Well, why don't we all go in the - Let me out!
Let me out!
What in the world was that?
Let me out!
Let me out!
Cool it, Malcolm.
Malcolm?
Darrin, go play golf.
Serena, so help me All right now, Serena.
Now that Darrin's gone, I want the facts.
- Who is that bird?
- He is not a bird.
He's Super Fink.
- Aren't you, Malcolm?
- Let me out!
You know, you' re getting to be a bore.
Malcolm.
Isn't that the warlock you've been going with?
"Been" is the correct tense.
- What did he do?
- I' II tell you what he didn't do.
He didn't tell me he was married.
And if I know you.
You didn't bother to ask.
Serena, I will thank you not to use our home as a hideout.
So take your bird and get out of here.
What's that?
It's Brunhilde.
Oh, she's tracked us down.
Thought you'd get away from me, eh?
You little fool.
Now, Brunhilde Where is he?
- I'm afraid you've made a little mistake.
- No.
Correction!
You have made a mistake and it's not a little one.
- Now, if you'd just quiet down - No!
You quiet down.
In the old days, they'd have put you away for husband-stealing.
The olden days.
I think that's exactly where I' II send you you wolfette.
Blow the winds And thunder crack Roll the years a century back Vixen, begone and mak e the switch Begone with the wind, you little witch I hope Darrin's going to be broad-minded about this.
Malcolm.
I know you' re here.
You show yourself or I' II whip up a tornado and blow you out!
Sorry.
I knew it.
Brunhilde, my dearest.
You have saved me from a terrible fate.
This little witch apparently developed an incurable yen for me and when I refused to yield to her advances she cast a spell over me.
- Feel my hand.
It's still quivering.
- Oh, my poor dear.
And all this time, I thought you were philandering.
My dear, how could you think such a thing?
Well, come along.
We' re going home.
I bet when the mice see her, they jump on chairs.
Look what they've done to you, you poor child.
Carpetbaggers!
You need any help, honey?
L - Where am I?
- Oh, you do need help.
- This is New Orleans, child.
- New Orleans?
What am I doing here?
Well, I'd say not too good, if I'm any judge.
- Where you from?
- Well, I'm from I can't remember.
- Well, what's your name?
- My name is Now, look, child.
A pretty thing can't wander around the city not knowing her whereabouts or "whoseabouts".
You better come home with me.
I' II get you clean clothes some food for you to fat up on.
Now you just come along with me, honey and I'm gonna take you home.
Aunt Jenny.
Contrary to gossip, I am not running a home for wayward girls.
But the poor thing is so frail and lost and all.
Can't she stay until her remembrance come back, Mr. Rance?
The answer is no.
She's been fed, now send her on her way.
She won't be no trouble.
I' II see to that.
And what are the neighbours going to say?
An attractive bachelor like myself harbouring a young girl under my roof.
They gonna say, you are the most generous the most kindest gentleman there is.
My neighbours?
Well, who cares what them no-accounts say.
Now she's outside waiting to thank you for the vittles.
- Can't you at least say hello?
- No.
But I'm sure I shall have no peace until I do.
- Bring her in.
- Thank you, Mr. Rance.
That silly woman.
It's ridiculous.
Every stray cat that comes wandering by, she just This is the young lady, Mr. Rance.
And this is Mr. Rance Butler.
My dear.
My house is your house for as long as you like.
Perhaps even longer.
This is a nightmare.
A nightmare!
Oh, Sam!
Will you stop whining and let me concentrate?
Now I have to remember that incantation word for word.
Blow, ye winds And thunder crack How could this happen?
Vixen, begone and mak e the switch I go out to play golf.
When I come back, my wife's in the twilight zone.
Links to jinx!
Begone with the wind You little witch That's it!
- Which?
- Oh, well.
It's close enough.
You see, it's your average Beauty And The Beast curse.
If she gives a willing kiss to a mortal, she'll return to the present.
Now listen, Serena.
Sam's not kissing any mortal unless it's me.
Exactly, darling.
You mean, I gotta go back?
- Exactly, darling.
- Yeah, exactly, darling.
Oh, now, it's really very simple.
By using the same incantation I can send you to the same time and place.
Serena, this better work.
but I wouldn't want to live there.
I find her, she kisses me and that's it?
- Right.
- I'm ready.
There's just one little thing I ought to mention.
- Samantha won't know you, of course.
- Of course.
What?
How could she?
You haven't been born yet.
I' II be a perfect stranger to my own wife?
Stranger, yes.
But hardly perfect.
Serena, if they ever put a price on your head, I' II gladly pay it.
Oh, you make such a big deal out of nothing.
Here goes.
And hang on to that picture.
You' II need it.
Blow, ye winds and thunder crack Roll the years a century back - Why, Rance!
- How beautiful.
You sitting there magnolias waving in the breeze those happy voices singing.
Happy?
- They love me, you know.
- Really?
Then why do they keep singing "Massa's in de Cold, Cold Ground"?
What are you doing home from work?
You left an hour ago.
Well, a man is entitled to some leisure moments.
Besides I couldn't bear being separated from you any longer.
Oh, why, Rance, what a thing to say!
We've known each other for such a short time.
Long enough for me to know I've fallen quite in love, I'm afraid.
Oh, why, Rance, you can't be serious.
You don't even know my name.
So what?
Neither do you.
My dearest say you' II marry me.
If only I knew who I was or where I came from.
Oh, my Darling, what does it matter?
Let's simply say that you've been reborn that you come to me with no ties, no past.
Only a future.
Rance.
Rance, let me go.
Please!
Is it too soon?
No, but your stickpin's killing me.
Curses.
I'm sorry, my dear.
Oh, my poor child.
I've overexcited you.
I know the very thing.
I' II have Aunt Jenny bring you some sassafras tea.
Please don't.
But it' II calm your nerves.
Have you ever tried it?
Yes.
And I'd rather be nervous.
Strange girl.
- Hello.
Is this the Butler plantation?
- Yes, it is.
- Are you Aunt Jenny?
- Depends.
- Is you a bill collector?
- No.
- I'm Aunt Jenny.
- I was told you found a young lady wandering and you brought her here.
- A blonde, pretty?
- That's right.
I'd like to see her, please.
Won't do you no good.
She's taken.
- Taken?
- I happen to know from over-listening that Mr. Rance is going to marry her.
What?
And if he do, guess who's going to get a raise for bringing that lovely child home?
He can't marry her.
She's already married to me!
Guess who's going to be looking for a job.
Excuse me.
Aunt Jenny!
What's all this ruckus?
Mr. Rance, you about to commit bigotry.
Mr. Butler, my name is Darrin Stephens and I'm looking for - Sam!
- Sam?
Sam?
- Who are you?
- Sir!
What is the meaning of this?
She doesn't remember me, because of what's happened, but I'm her husband.
But as soon as she kisses me, it' II all come back.
Pucker up, Sam.
Don't you dare touch me!
See?
Doesn't that prove we' re married?
Sir, take your hands off that lady.
Why, this is preposterous!
If you can prove your claim, then do so.
If not, then get out!
All right.
Take a look at that.
Now where would I get that, if I weren't her husband?
Why, you could have secured this in any number of ways.
Boy, are you a tough customer.
I didn't want to do this, but you' re forcing me to.
Sam, take off your dress.
I beg your pardon!
Dear sir, what is the meaning of this?
Put me down and I' II tell you.
She has a mole in the middle of her back.
I' II be the judge of that, sir.
Take it off.
You are certainly no gentleman, sir.
I'm not trying to prove I'm a gentleman just that I'm your husband.
- Sir, I don't know who you are or why you insist upon making this claim but I cannot stand by and watch her humiliated any further.
- Out you go, sir.
- No, wait!
Wait!
Aunt Jenny, get your sassafras tea.
If I see your foolish face around here again l' II have you horsewhipped.
You Yankee.
Whatever happened to Southern hospitality?
My apologies for my violent outburst but obviously the man is a fraud.
He called me Sam.
Which proves my point.
What sort of a name is Sam for a beautiful young lady?
Sam?
What a strange name.
Darrin.
That's even stranger.
He's right.
They love him to death.
Please, Sam, don't scream.
I promise I' II explain everything to you.
Will you promise not to scream?
All right.
You promised and a lady never breaks her promise, right?
Sam, what l I didn't break my promise.
You' re the one who screamed.
You' re darn right You' re darn right I did.
That hurt.
Look, we' II never get out of here unless What?
You again?
Somebody's going to get horsewhipped.
Unhand her, you.
Are you all right, my beloved?
What is the meaning of this, sir?
- You want me to go fetch the sheriff?
- That won't be necessary, Jenny.
Oh, That's right.
We' re all civilized human beings, and - Don't stand there.
Get the sheriff!
- Here.
What is this for?
I never attack an unarmed man, sir.
- Who's armed?
- Why, you polecat!
You pick that up and defend yourself or I' II run you through.
Okay, but you' re contradicting yourself.
En garde.
Rance, no!
Let him go.
Why are you wasting your pity on this cur?
Now wait a minute.
I think if we just sit down and discuss this like civilized human beings - You, Yankee!
Polecat!
Oh, Rance.
Look what you've done!
Oh, you poor thing.
Are you hurt?
- Just a flesh wound.
- This man needs a doctor.
He doesn't need a doctor.
He needs a tailor.
On your feet, sir.
- Don't you touch him.
- Why are you protecting that polecat?
I don't know.
He's seems so So helpless.
So innocent.
So So what?
Where'd they go?
Where did who go?
The young lady and that Yankee.
I didn't see no young lady and no Yankee.
- You didn't?
- No.
Come to think of it, neither did I. Serena, cut that out.
Hi, coz.
How's the big hero this morning?
Fortunately for you, he doesn't remember a thing.
I put a spell on him so he' II think it was a dream.
Very clever.
Boy, did I have a terrible night.
And it doesn't look like much of a morning either.
Good morning to you too.
Did I have a nightmare!
I dreamt some old witch put a curse on you and put you back 100 years.
I had to go back and rescue you.
- Is that weird?
- It certainly is.
And you were in it too, somewhere.
You changed this guy into a bird, and his wife She was the one who put the curse on you.
I had to climb up a wall to get to you.
The trellis broke.
I fell right on my That's funny.
Sweetheart, why don't you sit down.
Have your cereal.
Wait a minute.
How come I got a bruise right where I fell in the dream?
Or would you prefer pancakes and sausages?
And what's Sunday's paper doing here when it's only Saturday?
It is Sunday, isn't it?
And it wasn't a dream!
Darrin, it's all over now.
I wouldn't say that.
I could have been killed.
Not to mention the sabre duel.
I've got a good mind never to speak to you again after what you Sabre duel?
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
You' re home early.
I planned it that way.
No nibbling.
You' II spoil your dinner.
We' II compromise.
I' II nibble you.
Delicious.
Oh, sweetheart, that tickles.
What's that?
Tabitha, fooling around with the stereo.
I told her not to do that.
- Tabitha, what are you doing?
- Playing the piano.
To be exact, she's playing Bach.
- And beautifully.
- And by witchcraft!
Oh, how utterly clever of you to figure that out.
Sweetie, why don't you run upstairs to your room?
Mommy and Daddy would like to have a nice little chat with Grandmama.
- Okay, Mommy.
- Right.
That's a good girl.
Sweetheart.
- When did you swoop in?
- Two minutes ago.
To give my dear grandchild a little present.
Isn't it cute?
Why couldn't you give Tabitha a piano without turning her into a Van Cliburn?
Sweetheart, Mother didn't exactly cast a spell on Tabitha.
- Not completely.
- Just on her fingers.
She merely brought out the hidden talent that lies within all of us.
Mortals excluded.
- Endora!
- Yes, Durweed, what is it?
What it is is that I'm sick and tired of you corrupting my daughter.
Corrupting?
How dare you!
Mother, Darrin doesn't exactly mean corrupting.
- Oh, yes, he does.
- Darrin.
I mean, she's worse than the Wicked Witch of the West!
Samantha, I refuse to stay here another minute and be compared to an amateur.
Three-to-one she takes back the piano.
That's fine.
When Tabitha's old enough to play the piano l' II buy her one.
- Provided- - Provided what?
That she learn to play it normally.
- Or is that impossible?
- Of course not.
Anyone can learn to play the piano.
That's exactly what I mean.
Could you learn to play the piano?
Starting from scratch, without any witchcraft?
Well?
Why would I want to do a thing like that?
Because it would set your daughter an excellent example.
Darrin, are you challenging me?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I am.
All right.
I accept your challenge.
You rent the piano, and I' II learn to play it normally.
And if I can't- Yes?
If I can't, I' II be more careful about accepting your challenges.
That was good.
It wasn't great, but it was good.
- Thank you.
- One may be born a witch, Samantha but it takes practice to become a virtuoso.
- Where's little Tabitha?
- Napping.
She' II be up in a minute.
I take it Durwood is at work doing whatever it is he does.
Yes.
And Darrin went with him.
Samantha, if you wanted to whip up a piano why didn't you whip up a new one?
I didn't whip this one up.
We rented it.
- And I'm about to take my first lesson.
- Lesson?
- Mm-hmm.
- From whom?
I am going to study and learn the mortal way.
It's a challenge I accepted of my own free will.
Plus a little pressure from Darrin.
That must be my teacher.
Mother, when Tabitha wakes up, would you keep her busy in her room?
Gladly.
I'd hate her to see you set such a poor example.
Thanks.
Samantha Stephens?
Johann Sebastian Monroe?
Yes.
I am to be addressed either as Mr. Monroe or sir.
Yes, sir.
Won't you come in?
You' re beginning rather late in life, aren't you?
Well, better late than never.
That remains to be seen.
Let me evaluate your fingers.
- How are they?
- Adequate.
No more, no less.
- Where is the instrument?
- In the living room.
For what we are about to do to you I apologize.
They said it was in perfect tune.
- Is it?
- Approximately.
At this stage of the game it doesn't make much difference.
Please be seated.
- I demand attention and obedience.
- Yes, sir.
Now, then, these are the black keys and these are the white keys.
- I know.
- Silence.
- I'm sorry.
- Mrs. Stephens silence means no talking.
Is that clear?
We shall start with the white keys and we shall play all the notes of the scale, otherwise known as- Do, re, mi, fa, so, la, ti, do Did you observe my fingers?
Can you imitate them?
Very well.
Try.
Just a second.
This is no insult to your ability but in my profession, eardrums have a tendency to become brittle and my doctor advises me to protect them.
Now inspire me.
Mrs. Stephens you are playing a piano.
You are not plucking a chicken.
Again.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, Mother.
- What is new?
- About what?
About that absurd idea of yours to learn to play the piano their way.
What is new is that my normal piano lessons are coming along normally.
And I'm having another one this afternoon.
- Oh?
- Mm-hmm.
- That's your granddaughter.
- Well, it sounds dreadful.
I know.
She's trying to copy her mother.
Watch her for me, will you, while I go out back and cut some flowers?
Hello, my little precious.
I was playing a big piano.
So I heard.
Why don't you play some music?
Mommy and Daddy don't want me to.
Come on now, Tabitha.
Please, please, play some pretty music for Grandmama.
Please?
That's my good girl.
Do you remember how we did it?
Put your little hands on the piano, yes.
Now we will begin.
Good afternoon.
I'm Mrs. Stephens's piano teacher.
Good afternoon.
I'm Mrs. Stephens's mother.
Won't you come in?
- Can that be your daughter?
- That's my granddaughter.
Your granddaughter?
How old is she?
- Four.
- Four.
Four!
Up to your old tricks, eh, Mother?
Good grief, Mother.
I wish you- - Bravo.
- Incredible.
Hi, there, Mr. Monroe- Sir.
Mother, would you please keep Tabitha busy in her room while I take my lesson?
- Just a second.
- Yes, sir?
Mrs. Stephens, this child is a musical genius.
- She is?
- She just picked it up, as if by magic.
I can't believe it.
Four years old, no lessons and she plays like a virtuoso.
Mr. Monroe, it's very kind of you to say that, but- Why am I wasting time on you when I should be working with her?
Well?
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Be careful!
Don't crush her fingers!
- Who are you?
- Johann Sebastian Monroe.
My fingers you can crush for I am a humble piano teacher whose distinguished career is spent in the search for one magnificent pupil.
But now destiny has rewarded me for my years of suffering.
Really?
With my wife?
No.
With your daughter.
- You' re kidding.
- Mr, Stephens I have just heard your daughter play the piano.
I consider her the greatest child prodigy of this century.
Sam, you didn't let Tabitha play by: Hello, Durwood.
Endora, for two cents, I'd- Madam, will you please occupy the child so the parents and I may plan her future?
Certainly.
And, by the way she gets her talent from her mother's side.
Come on, darling.
Come with Grandmama.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens, do you realize what you have on your hands?
Yes, sir.
I think we do.
It is the beginning of a golden era in musical history.
The era of Tabitha Stephens.
Mr. Monroe, if you don't mind, I've had a rough day at the office.
The road ahead will be a difficult one for all of us.
At least.
I dream of your daughter as a concert pianist adored by music lovers everywhere.
I suggest we arrange a recording session for Friday afternoon, yes?
- No.
- Why not?
- Why not?
- That's when she takes her nap.
- Nap.
- Naps are out.
From now on, it's work, work, work.
At $10 a lesson, lesson, lesson, we could end up in the poorhouse.
I shall accept no fee while I prepare her for the concert tour.
Who said she was taking a tour?
Her first recital will be at Carnegie Hall.
Then 40 major cities in 40 weeks.
I shall take good care of her.
And I promise to bring her home for Christmas.
That's very thoughtful of you.
Mr. Monroe, we do not want Tabitha away from us for 40 weeks.
How about 30?
Mr. Monroe, my wife and I are sorry to disappoint you but the answer is no.
We do not want our daughter to be a concert pianist.
I am speechless.
Good.
Then we can end our discussion.
I beg you to reconsider.
And remember that time is of the essence.
Because the talent of a child prodigy must be gently nurtured like a delicate flower so that the world will benefit from its unfolding.
- Good day, Mr. Monroe.
- Don't make a snap decision.
Sleep on it.
Oh, darn.
Now what's wrong?
He left without giving me my lesson.
Just a little tension breaker.
I just gave the child prodigy her bath.
Swell.
Now I think I' II practice my piano.
I think you better practice your speech.
What speech?
The one that gets rid of Johann Sebastian Monroe.
- You want me to quit?
- No, just change your piano teacher.
Into what?
Sam, this is serious.
He thinks that destiny has rewarded him with a child prodigy.
He' II never stop bugging us.
I guess you' re right.
- Unless- - Unless what?
Unless I can find him another child prodigy.
How about your mother?
She can turn herself into a four-year-old.
She can go on the concert tour.
She wouldn't even have to come home for Christmas.
If I could find him a really talented pupil it would take his mind off Tabitha, wouldn't it?
- Sure, but- - I' II bet there are lots of talented kids who'd love to be concert pianists.
True.
But how do we find one?
- Well.
- By supernatural hocus-pocus!
Darrin, do you want to get Mr. Monroe off our back or not?
- I guess so.
- Thank you.
Now stand back and give me room to operate.
Piano child prodigy, if I am near you send vibrations so I can hear you.
I hear music.
You do?
It's Franz Liszt's "Liebesträume".
Good-bye, sweetheart.
I' II be back soon.
Youthful genius, keep on playing.
I'm flying now and later paying.
Sorry.
Please, go on.
May I help you?
I hope I'm not intruding.
I was out taking a stroll, and I heard the music.
It sounded so lovely, I wanted to find out who was playing.
Please continue.
- He plays beautifully.
- Thank you.
He's my son.
- You must be very proud of him.
- Thank you.
I am.
- I'm Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
- Robert Williams, the school custodian.
- And this is Mathew.
- Hi.
Hi.
You' re a very talented young man.
Where did you learn to play like that?
I learned music from a correspondence course.
But I just like to play a lot.
We have no piano at home, so I bend the rules a little and let him come to work with me and practice here.
My ambition is to be a concert pianist.
Mathew, somehow I have the feeling you' re gonna make it.
But, first, you have to continue practicing.
- I'm sorry I interrupted you.
- That's okay.
It was a pleasure meeting both of your, Mr. Williams.
- Good night, Mathew.
- Good night.
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
Thank you for the encouragement.
- Bye-bye.
- Good night.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Did you find a prodigy?
- Mm-hmm.
I certainly did.
Where'd you get the coat?
I wonder who that could be.
Maybe it's your travel agent.
Good evening.
Mr. Monroe!
You said you'd let us sleep on it.
I was too excited.
I had to return.
With me I brought the internationally celebrated symphonic conductor Maestro Alfredo Ferranini.
Really?
Well, Maestro, this is an honour.
We have several of your records.
Naturally.
Who doesn't?
The maestro has agreed to listen to your daughter play the piano.
Since you will not accept my judgment, perhaps you will accept his.
Maestro, this is my husband, Darrin.
Darrin, this is Maestro Ferranini.
He has agreed to listen to Tabitha play the piano.
He has?
Who asked him?
I did.
I'm president of his fan club.
Maestro, with all due respect, my wife and I refuse to- Johann, these people bore me.
Fetch the pianist.
- Yes, Maestro.
- Wait, wait.
- I' II fetch her myself.
- Samantha- Darrin, if the maestro insists, the maestro insists.
Please, wait in the living room.
Fair.
Johann this better be good.
Yes, Maestro.
Trust me.
Not so close.
Maestro, this is Miss Tabitha Stephens.
No formalities.
Just command her to play.
All right.
Okay, sweetheart.
Come on.
All right.
Now, play.
Halt!
Halt!
Maestro, she was brilliant this afternoon.
I don't understand it.
That's enough piano, sweetheart.
You run off to bed.
Daddy and Mommy will kiss you good night in a minute.
What was that, a joke?
Please, gentlemen, if I can have your attention.
We have found you a real child prodigy.
His name is Mathew Williams.
I am not interested in any more child prodigies!
Johann, so it finally happened.
You were neurotic to begin with, and now you've cracked up!
Please.
Please, Maestro, don't- Maestro- Maestro, I give you my word of honour.
Johann, you' re a sick man.
Your word of honour doesn't mean beans.
Until you get medical attention you' re suspended from my fan club.
I don't understand it.
What happened?
We tried to tell you we didn't want Tabitha to be a concert pianist, but you wouldn't listen.
No, you just forced us to discourage you.
- You succeeded.
- Please- Tabitha said when she grows up she wants to be a normal housewife.
Just like her mother.
But don't let it discourage you, Mr. Monroe.
As I said before, we have found you a real prodigy.
Would you like to sit down and hear about him?
His name is Mathew Williams.
Actually, I found him by coincidence.
Mathew, that's the best news I've heard in weeks.
You' re entirely welcome.
Give my regards to your father.
Bye-bye.
- Guess what?
- What?
Mr. Monroe had Mathew play for Maestro Ferranini who was favourably impressed.
- So, Johann is back in the fan club?
- Mm-hmm.
And destiny has finally rewarded Mr. Monroe.
Swell.
Now, from the sublime to the ridiculous.
Honey, you' re playing a song.
Mr. Monroe said I was ready for it.
You did it.
You said you could learn to play without witchcraft, and you did it.
- Am I proud of you.
- Thank you.
Mother, once and for all, cut that out.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Here.
Look, sweetheart, dishpan hands.
That's terrible.
No, it isn't.
It's wonderful.
I've always wanted dishpan hands.
Makes a witch feel like she belongs.
Well, on you they look good.
Happy, sweetheart?
Let's see, I've got a beautiful wife, a lovely daughter a comfortable home, a good job.
I guess I'm reasonably happy.
Why only reasonably?
I would be ecstatically happy if you were an orphan.
Another remark like that, and I' II be a widow.
Honey, I was only joking.
It's jokes like that that can get you turned into an artichoke.
Besides, I thought you and Mother were getting along well lately.
You' re almost on speaking terms.
Let's hope it stays almost.
How about a little after-dinner drink?
All right.
Let's have something different and marvellous and exotic.
Scotch and soda?
Delicious.
Darrin, why don't you try a new approach to Mother?
Well, she's not all bad, you know?
She does have a good side.
All you have to do is find it and get on it.
I'll admit that's not easy, but I think it's worth a try.
Don't you, sweetheart?
Don't you?
Darrin, just because I said Mother has a good side doesn't mean you have to stop talking to me.
Darrin?
Darrin?
Darrin?
Darrin.
Darrin?
Mother.
Mother?
I demand that you appear before me immediately and no stalling.
I hope you have good news.
You just plucked me off a coral reef.
Don't be cute.
I'm not being cute.
I was skin diving in the Bahamas with Jacques-Yves Cousteau.
Now, if you' II just excuse me.
Mother, Darrin is gone, and you know it.
Oh, you do have good news.
Now tell me.
You tell me.
Where is he?
Very well.
I' II tell you, straight out.
I haven't the foggiest.
Now, Mother, I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this but repeat after me: Spiders that crawl, bats that fly, silence my tongue if I'm telling a lie.
Samantha, get hold of yourself.
I'd like to take credit for Durwood's disappearance but I give you my word, I had nothing to do with it.
- You didn't?
- No.
Then where is he?
Well, I don't know.
Now, Mother, let's be calm about this.
I am calm.
I'm positively serene.
It's you who are all stoked up.
Mother, Darrin's gone, and somebody's got him.
Who'd want him?
Now, who would Uncle Arthur.
That's it.
Uncle Arthur is using Darrin for one of his practical jokes.
Well, why would he do a thing like that?
Durwood is already a practical joke.
Mother.
But why would Uncle Arthur is cooking up one of his mad, wild That wasn't Uncle Arthur.
No, it certainly was not.
- Well, who was it?
- I haven't the slightest idea.
I hope.
Carlotta.
Endora, darling.
How nice to see you again after all these years.
You' re a sight for sore eyes.
Oh, thank you, my dear Carlotta and you' re a sight too.
Mother Mother I hate to barge into this reunion, but You' re Samantha.
Right.
Who are you?
What a beautiful creature you are.
You don't look at all like your mother.
Mother, please, pull in your claws.
Carlotta, you must be here for some reason.
Does it involve Darrin?
Aren't you going to offer me something to drink?
We' re fresh out of hemlock.
Oh, now stop it, you two.
My husband's gone, and you two are playing cat and cat.
She's right.
Enough of this merriment.
- Endora.
- What?
Haven't you told Samantha about our little deal?
It must have slipped my mind.
Very well.
I' II tell you about it myself.
It seems that at the turn of the century Vanity prevents my naming which.
- Your mother promised the hand of her firstborn daughter to my firstborn son.
Oh, I vaguely remember something like that.
When the planet Icarus passes between Pluto and Jupiter, I collect.
Oh, you' re both mad.
But not half as mad as I'm getting.
Oh, it was eons ago, darling.
Eons ago at a party.
Carlotta, get this straight I am already married.
Marriages to mortals don't count.
- You bring him back here this instant.
- But of course, my dear.
Now, where shall we put him?
The telly might be fun.
Help!
Oh, now, Darrin, don't you worry.
I' II get you out of there.
Relax.
Those aren't animals chasing him.
They are only animal sounds.
And if you refuse to marry my son, Juke your precious Darrin will be running from those sounds forever.
Carlotta, it's witches like you that give us all a bad name.
Thank you.
Mother, how could you make such a primitive marital arrangement?
They did that sort of thing in the Middle Ages.
I think it was in the Middle Ages.
Are you ready to go and meet Juke?
Carlotta, why don't the two of us sit down and discuss this thing like intelligent Help!
Help!
I'm ready.
Don't worry, Samantha.
I' II think of something.
I hope so.
And I' II take good care of Tabitha for you.
Just don't marry her off while I'm gone.
And this is Juke's room.
He's so proud of all his pinups.
Why, all these pictures are of me.
But of course.
Juke has been in love with you ever since he was a baby.
But he's never even met me.
Just a formality.
Mother?
Mother, I'm home.
We' re up here, darling.
I'm sorry I am late, but I ran into some old school friends Oh, that's all right, darling.
Juke, dear, we have a guest.
It's Samantha.
Hello, Juke.
Hi.
Shake her hand, dear.
That's enough.
Now then, Juke dear who always keeps her word?
You do, Mother.
And who promised that someday you would have Samantha as your wife?
You did, Mother.
And what a handsome couple you will make.
Glorious.
Remember, Samantha.
What's that?
Just your mother's depraved sense of humour.
I didn't put up any of those pictures of you, Samantha.
My mother did.
Here's another one with dear cousin Serena.
Hey, how about her?
No, Mother made up her mind.
It's got to be you.
Don't you ever talk back to your mother?
Of course I do.
Lots of times.
- Then all we have to do - I talk back when she's asleep or in the shower.
You should've heard me tell her off.
- I was magnificent.
- Groovy.
It's amazing with a mother like that how I turned out so well-adjusted.
Juke, there's one thing we can do.
- What's that?
- You' II have to stand up to her.
- No, think of another thing to do.
- Oh, come on, Juke.
You can do it.
Just try.
You' re wrong.
I can't change the pattern of a lifetime just like that.
After all, the roots of my cowardice run deep.
But you' re a warlock.
No, warlock schmorlock.
Juke, look maybe if you'd act like a warlock, you'd begin to feel like one.
Well, l - I guess I can try.
- What did you say?
I said I' II try, Samantha.
That's better.
Now, let's practice.
Just pretend that I'm your mother.
Yes, ma'am.
Juke, I thought you said you'd try.
Oh, I will.
I will.
Let's do it again.
Yeah, well, okay, sit down.
Now, here goes.
Now, you make believe I'm your mother.
- Good morning, Juke.
- What's good about it?
Juke, just because you' re a warlock doesn't mean you have to be nasty.
Just stand up for your rights.
- Stand up.
- Your rights.
Rights.
I got you.
I got you.
- Good morning, Juke darling.
- Good morning, Mother.
It is such a beautiful day.
Why don't you and I take a fly in the sky?
I'd rather not, Mother.
Juke, Mother wants you to go flying with her.
I've made other plans.
I'm flying with some of the guys to the Riviera.
That's it, Juke.
Keep up the good work.
Mother does not like you to fly so far from home.
Tough!
I positively forbid it.
Tough and double-tough.
I'm a warlock, and what I say goes.
Bravo, Juke.
How do you feel?
Strong, like the warlock I am.
Take me to the enemy.
Mother, let's get one thing straight.
Juke, dear, you' re blocking my sun.
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Mother, I will not fly with you today, so don't even bother to ask me.
- And furthermore - Juke, dear be a good boy and bring Mother a cup of iced nectar.
Not only am I an adult, I'm a warlock, which is the strongest thing around.
Juke, Mother is thirsty.
And what I say goes because every witch knows my word is Would you like cream or lemon in your nectar?
Lemon.
Oh, Samantha, you' re back.
The wedding's off, right?
Wrong.
It's still on.
And the irony of it is that Juke doesn't even want to marry me.
Well, then there's no problem.
You don't know Juke.
Carlotta has him very well trained.
On command, he sits and heels.
He even fetches.
Oh, Samantha, what a shame.
A shame is getting a run in your stocking.
This is a catastrophe.
Oh, I'm afraid, my darling, that you' II have to go through with it.
Carlotta's a very powerful witch.
As strong as she is she must have a weakness, an Achilles' heel.
As a matter of fact, she has Achilles' heel.
It's bronzed and mounted on her mantelpiece.
Yet there's something about her, something vulnerable.
I warn you, Samantha.
Zap for zap, she's unbeatable.
Mother, I'm not going to fight her with witchcraft.
I've just thought of a much more powerful weapon.
That's Carlotta's calling card.
She always was one for a big entrance.
I think I' II make a little exit.
How dare you desert my son.
Perhaps you have forgotten: Help!
Help!
The next time, I put animals behind those sounds.
You dare to yawn in the jaws of my power?
Carlotta, your threats are beginning to bore me.
Very well, Samantha, you asked for it.
Lions and tigers, after your prey Darrin Stephens is your feast today.
Mother, please wait.
Samantha, she means it.
She's serious.
She' II really do it.
Let her.
- Let her?
- Let me?
Yes.
Do you know what your problem is, Carlotta?
Oversell.
You don't have enough faith in your own son.
Well, that's true, Mother.
You' II have to admit that.
Juke is warm and sensitive.
You think so?
Of course.
And how could I resist that personality that charm, that wit.
Well, after all, he is his mother's son.
And his looks.
He's also his father's son.
Gee, Samantha.
I should have tried to played down my attractiveness.
I'm sorry it got out of hand.
I owe you a great debt, Juke.
Being married to a mortal was a strain.
You've set me free.
I think this calls for a little celebration.
Champagne.
For our new, happy little family.
To our new family.
What's the matter?
You' re not drinking.
Don't you like the toast?
Of course he does.
It's just that he doesn't drink.
It gives him flushes.
It does not.
Mother says it does.
Nonsense.
One little drink can't hurt him.
I am his mother.
And if I say no, it's no.
I am his wife-to-be, and I say yes.
Well, I guess he could have one little drink.
Good.
To our new life together.
Gee, oh, I like this stuff.
Samantha, you' re gonna make a great wife.
- Oh, it's only the beginning, Juke.
- Beginning?
What beginning?
Of the new Juke.
For instance, look at the way he's dressed.
Where'd you get that suit, Juke?
Mother zapped it for me.
Well, it' II have to go.
I'm beautiful.
- Groovy.
- Ghastly.
A wife has something to say about the way her husband dresses and I say: I am his mother, and I say: Hold it!
I'm the wearer, and I say it stays.
Well, all of this will straighten out when you are married and come home to live.
Oh, surely you don't think we' re gonna live with you?
Atta-witch, Samantha.
But don't worry, Carlotta.
You' II have visitation rights.
You will allow me to visit my own son?
Oh, well, of course.
I'm not heartless.
You can visit him every other Sunday.
And you can always phone me.
Juke.
You may look, but don't touch.
This marriage is off!
Oh, no, this marriage is not off.
What?
Mother, I've been thinking lately.
You shouldn't think too much.
It makes you bald.
I've been thinking.
A deal is a deal.
- I'm going to marry Samantha.
- Juke Just come home with me and I won't ever tell you what to do again.
She won't even suggest.
Well, let's see.
First of all, I dig these clothes.
What you dig is all I desire.
And another thing, I'm gonna live on my own cloud.
No.
That's where I draw the line.
Juke, at least get a cloud on the same block as your mother.
Well Well, okay.
Now, pop off, Mother.
I' II be right there.
Now, wait a minute.
What about Darrin?
I will send Darrin to you as soon as you send Juke to me.
- I hate to rush you, Juke - Oh, I'm leaving.
I'm leaving.
I did want to thank you for showing me how to handle my mother.
- Anytime.
- And, Samantha if you ever get tired of being married to a mortal l' II be around.
I think I' II make mine a double.
I think I' II have a double too.
A double?
Well, it's been quite an evening.
I' II drink to that.
There is nothing like a nice, quiet evening at home just the two of us.
You' re right.
There's nothing quite like it.
Just in time for my second cup of café au lait.
Sorry, Mother dear, but I'm down to my last drop.
Oh, well, no matter.
I prefer instant coffee anyway.
What are you doing up so early?
Or haven't you been to sleep yet?
I bring news, Samantha.
A letter from Juke.
Well, it's been months since his emancipation.
I was wondering how he was getting along.
Well, he says that - Mother, you didn't.
- Of course not.
How could you think that I'd What did the dear boy say?
"Dear Samantha just a note to let you know that I found the right girl for me and we' re getting married".
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Go on.
"And just as soon as my wife decides when we' re going on our honeymoon and when we' re coming back and where we' re going to live l' II let you know, and you can visit us.
- That is if my wife will allow it.
- That is if my wife will allow it.
- Love, Juke".
- Love, Juke".
Oh, Mother.
- You' re such a naughty witch.
- I know.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Mother.
Good morning, darling.
I bring you greetings from the Witches' Council where you're needed immediately.
I'm fixing Darrin's breakfast.
Oh, now there's an earthshaking mission.
What a day wasn't it?
- Mother was just leaving.
I'll go get the paper.
Excuse me.
Of course, Durweed.
- All right, Mother.
What's the problem?
- The problem is that since you married that mortal, you've only made two appearances before the Witches' Council.
To say they're getting restless puts it mildly.
You may tell them that I do not choose to oblige.
I've too much to do around here today.
I know you've forgotten most of what you learned at my knee but you remember what the Council does to those who stand in their way.
Let them do their worst.
- What's that?
- I hope it's their worst.
Mother.
Mother!
He never looked better.
- Mother, do something.
- It's a Council move, Samantha.
There's nothing I can do.
But there's something you can do.
All right.
But first I'll have to ask Darrin if he minds.
- Ask?
- Mother, that's what a wife does.
Tell him the truth.
I'm sure he'd rather do without you for a few hours than wind up a bird perch.
Mother, pop out.
Darrin, are you in there?
Witches' Council, noble eight, clearly hear me as I state: In haste I'll fly to do my task but release the spell so I may ask.
Good news.
Mother just left.
You all right?
No.
You know I don't like your mother popping in first thing in the morning.
A man's entitled to some privacy.
- What do you mean, am I all right?
- Nothing.
What did old "double, double, toil and trouble" want?
Really, Darrin.
You have such a suspicious mind.
- What was that?
- Just a little bird.
Cute, huh?
Come on inside.
I'll make breakfast.
Come on.
- Like it?
- Are you gonna tell me or not?
- You think I have something to say?
- A little bird told me.
I have to appear at the Witches' Council.
I'd only be gone a few hours.
Samantha, let's get something straight.
First you're my wife.
Then you're a witch.
And a wife's place is with her husband.
Oh, good.
I guess that means you want me to play golf with you this afternoon.
You know what I mean.
I've not only lost a daughter, I've gained a bullhorn.
Don't apologize if you have to leave before I finish dressing.
- Well?
- I can't go.
You can't not go.
That's it.
Serena can appear before the Council and pretend she's me.
Samantha, you can fool all of the people some of the time and some people all of the time but don't try to put anything over on a witch.
- However - However?
Serena certainly could fool Durwood.
Well, I'd hate to deceive him.
Well, that's because you haven't had enough practice.
Once you get the technique smoothed out, it's a groove.
- A groove?
- I keep up.
Well, I guess I don't have any other choice.
I am here.
The heart has answers the eyes cannot see.
It is truly said, the wise man is he who hears the unlistened- for v oice.
What's that supposed to mean?
The guru is a groove.
She keeps up too.
Serena, put the flowers down.
We need you.
A favour is the reach a soul can make.
- What's up?
- You are.
And if you really want to be helpful, you'll get down here.
Serena, all you have to do is stay here for one afternoon pretend to be me, so Darrin won't know I've gone to a Council meeting.
What do I do?
Just be a housewife for a few hours.
Serena, you owe me a lot of favours.
Here's a chance to clean the slate.
Okay.
Quit staring at me.
You know I'm right.
No husband would put up with his wife flying all over who-knows-where.
It's not like you're a stewardess.
If that crack about joining my foursome was supposed to make me feel guilty about playing golf today it didn't even make a dent.
You haven't much time, Samantha.
Now, remember, Serena, no witchcraft.
Witch's honour.
I'll be just like you: The perfect little wife.
- Don't overdo it.
- Don't worry.
Well, I'm on my way.
Behave yourself.
What do I do first, dust something?
Look, I picked flowers.
Hi, Auntie Serena.
Where's Mommy?
Tabitha, how would you like to go to the zoo?
That would be fun.
Honestly.
The usual, Ernie.
Oh, and make it a double for old Arnie Palmer here.
- Knock it off.
- Are you Arnold Palmer?
Say, how about taking a look at my grip?
- I'm not Arnold Palmer.
- He is not Arnold Palmer.
- Are you?
- No.
Then that must be me.
Boy, I sure have slipped.
You're upset.
- Anything you wanna talk about?
- No.
- Sam, huh?
- And I don't wanna talk about it.
Well, whatever it is, I've been there.
I've seen it all.
Twenty years in the loser's circle.
I was a heel this morning, a loudmouth, self-righteous dum-da-dum.
- That's "dum-dum".
Thanks.
Well, we're all heels once in a while.
They force you into it.
It's not the same.
Sam is different.
Listen, Louise isn't Chicken Delight.
Take it from Uncle Larry.
Marriage is like the main event.
You gotta roll with the punches.
That old Wedded Bliss Special is off the track, so what do you do?
You gotta get it back on the tracks.
What's?
Tate's famous tête-à-tête, the honeymoon special guaranteed to solder a doddering marriage.
That's ridiculous.
A second honeymoon?
Moonlight and laughter, just the two of you some romantic spot you used to go to.
Fill her with memories and champagne.
Forget the kid and the mortgage and - And the office?
- You don't have to overdo it.
Larry, are you offering me a vacation?
Darrin, anything that can't be done over a weekend isn't worth doing.
Thanks, Larry.
I'm going home right now and start putting my marriage back on the right track.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
- It is?
- Not because I approve but because I've been a stubborn, willful, unreasonable boor.
Till I've made it up to you you can do all the witchcraft you want.
What are you doing home?
I felt so badly about the way I acted this morning - You did?
I didn't even finish my golf game.
- You didn't?
- And I wanna make up.
You do?
How?
- I'll tell you in the car.
- What car?
- Where are we going?
- I thought we might take a little drive.
No.
No, no, no, I couldn't possibly.
I have to finish the housework.
Go ahead.
Just give a little zap while I go upstairs and change.
It's a good thing your mother took Tabitha after all.
We're free as the birds.
And the bees.
Darling, marriage is an institution, not a vacation resort.
- He's back from his golf game.
- Oh, no.
It's worse.
He wants to take me for a ride.
What does that mean?
- He wants to make up.
- Oh, I know what that means.
- What am I going to do?
- Ready, honey.
You'd better do what Samantha would do.
- What's that?
- Anything he says.
Well, we've certainly had our little drive and I feel better.
But it's getting late, so let's go home.
We have no home.
We're gypsies, free and unfettered.
Darrin, I really think we should head home.
Relax, honey.
Forget about the house and the baby.
There's just you and me and Mother Nature.
Boy, that's some threesome.
Isn't there anything else on the radio?
That's the perfect music.
Perfect?
For what?
You'll see.
Where are we?
Sam, you can't make me believe you've forgotten where we spent our honeymoon?
Honeymoon?
"Moonthatch Inn"?
Oh, hello, hello, hello, my little lovebirds, hello.
So, you have flown back to the nest.
It's good to see you, Madame Wageir.
Sam?
Ye lt was nice seeing you again, Madame Wageir.
Goodbye.
Of course.
"Goodbye".
I understand.
Do not worry.
I disappear.
No one know how to disappear like Madame Wageir.
I do.
But I won't.
Serena, I'm home.
I got back early.
Serena?
Serena, you're off the hook.
So, it is perfect.
At Moonthatch Inn, love begin.
The key to happiness.
And now: I disappear.
Well here we are.
I noticed.
Now let's go home.
We can come back tomorrow.
We're not going anywhere until we've had a heart-to-heart talk.
One, I apologize for this morning.
I was selfish, and I'm sorry.
Two, I know you'll forgive me.
Three, we're going to have a beautiful weekend here together.
Weekend?
We can't.
- The baby.
- We'll call Endora and receive her undying gratitude for getting to baby-sit all weekend.
- Don't.
L I mean, they're probably not back from the zoo yet.
You're right.
Anyway, we shouldn't interrupt this moment even with a phone call, sweetheart.
Look!
- Lunch.
I'm starved.
- Well, that's good.
We'll need our strength for those long walks out on the dunes.
Remember?
The crashing of the surf There's an idea.
Let's go take a long walk on the dunes.
Well, I'm tired from the drive.
What about getting into something comfortable?
How about the car?
That's comfortable.
Sam, I don't mean to sound melodramatic but there's something precious at stake.
You don't know the half of it.
Sam, please.
I'll go down to the car.
I packed a bag for us.
Now there's nothing more to be said.
We're going to spend the weekend here together.
- And that's it?
- And that's it.
Well, if that's it You try to relax.
- Okay, Sam, I get the picture.
- No, you don't, really.
Don't make it worse.
Let's not lie to each other.
It isn't what you think.
I mean l'm just not myself today.
Hey you're not feeling shy about all this, are you?
That's it.
I'm shy.
So let's go home.
Honey, it's me, the fella you said "I do" to.
I know I did, but I don't now.
So let's go home?
- You're still mad.
- No, I'm not, really.
And I'll prove it to you.
Not now.
Later.
Mother, I knew I shouldn't have gone.
- Well, you did what you had to.
- But it's after 6.
Where are they?
Surely you're not worried about what's-his-name being with Serena?
No.
Course not.
There they are.
I think you better pop out until you can effect a transfer with Serena.
Yeah.
Right.
Tabitha is waiting up to say night-night.
Oh, you You go ahead, sweetheart.
I'll be up in a minute.
Isn't she back yet?
- Hi.
- Boy, am I glad to see you.
Serena, what happened?
Some other time.
I just want to go off somewhere and meditate.
Serena, hold it.
Wh What happened?
Where were you?
Moonthatch Inn.
Moonthatch Inn?
Where we spent our honeymoon?
Moonthatch Inn, where perfection reigns and luckily, the sun never sets.
What's that supposed to mean?
It means, the next time you need a stand-in around here do me a favour and call a theatrical agent.
- Did you have a good time at the zoo?
- Yes.
What did Auntie Serena bring me?
Auntie Serena's not here, dear.
She was here this morning with Grandmama.
Are you sure?
I asked her where Mommy was and that's when Grandmama took me to the zoo.
Should I tell you about the animals?
You already have, sweetheart.
You You've been awfully quiet all evening.
Just thinking.
About today Well, I hope you understand, I wasn't quite Well, if If I was a little funny, I'm sorry.
- Funny?
- You know withdrawn, coolish.
You call that withdrawn?
I wasn't withdrawn?
You want me to tell you that you were mysterious and exciting that I never found you more adorable and desirable.
Well, I won't, because, frankly l'm just too tired.
So good night, you wench, you.
Good night, Darrin.
How'd things go at the Council meeting?
Oh, everything went fine.
L - You knew all the time!
- Now, hold it!
Sam - Darrin, that was so mean!
- I give up.
I give up.
I give up.
- I give up.
- Well, okay.
- So do I. I shouldn't have sneaked out.
- I shouldn't have said no.
No.
No, you were right.
I said I'd only attend meetings here.
I should've stuck to it.
And I should have taken you back to Moonthatch Inn a long time ago.
How about next weekend?
What do you say?
"There is no time or place where love transcends".
That's guru talk.
Serena taught me.
Yeah, what does it mean?
It means Moonthatch Inn begins at home.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
And how long have you been standing there, honey?
I came in around the crow's feet.
Did I miss anything?
Just checking to see how the old boy's holding up under the years.
And how is the old boy holding up?
Great, except for a receding hairline, a double chin and a trace of a pot.
Oh, sweetheart.
On you, it looks good.
Sam, the key today is youth.
Eighty percent of the accounts that McMann & Tate handle are designed to appeal to people under 30.
Well, you appeal to people under 30.
Tabitha adores you.
Honey, I'm not kidding.
I've got to get with it.
If you're over 30, the youth of today doesn't trust you.
But, Darrin, in advertising it's talent that counts, and that's you at any age.
Honey, you just don't understand.
Your problem is that you love me.
That's not my problem, that's my pleasure.
Well.
Isn't that sweet.
- Making up after a fight?
- Endora, don't you ever knock?
We're not home.
Fortunately for you, I don't offend easily.
Let me try a little harder.
I'd appreciate it if when I got home tonight, you're not here!
Sweetheart, now, you're going to be late for work.
Now, remember, you're just as young as you feel.
Right.
Oh, I see Durwood is his usual charming self.
It's nothing.
Just a little concerned about creeping middle age.
Perfectly natural.
Perfectly vain is what it is.
Vain?
Darrin hasn't a vain bone in his body.
Well, I admit he has nothing to be vain about, but that doesn't stop him.
Mortals are the vainest creatures in the world.
- Darrin is the exception.
- Mommy.
- And furthermore - Mommy!
Coming, Tabitha.
"Furthermore" will have to wait.
Tabitha and I are going to the park.
Oh, Samantha, you're so blind when it comes to that mortal nothing.
Not a vain bone in his body, eh?
We'll see about that.
Not a vain bone in your body, eh?
Vanish all self-control And now we will see Just how vain you mortals can be Let's go, gorgeous!
Shut up!
What are you waiting for, a fire?
That's 93 years of our history.
I believe you missed a page.
Yes.
- Oh, did I?
- Here we are.
Page 11.
Oh, yes.
The Pharmaceutical Gold Seal Award, 1944.
Very impressive.
Hascomb Drug Company won that for its licorice-flavoured liver pills.
Sounds delicious.
You know, Tate, this tanning lotion product of ours is a new departure.
Until now, we've made nothing but pills.
Frankly, I'm a little worried about branching out.
Oh, relax, Mr. Hascomb.
Our specialty is launching new products.
I hope so.
But still, if it were a pill I'd feel a lot more comfortable.
- Here, have one.
- What for?
Whatever ails you.
You name it, Hascomb's got the pill for it.
Now, the red ones are for tension, the whites for indigestion and the pinks for neuritis and neuralgia.
They're so tempting, it's a shame I'm feeling so well.
Tate, Sunspot Tanning Lotion was not my idea.
I was against it right from the beginning.
It was my wife who kept insisting we try something new.
Impossible woman, constantly interfering.
Let me put you at ease.
We at McMann & Tate plan to handle Sunspot Tanning Lotion with the same dignity that your pills have enjoyed all these years.
Good, good.
No flashy campaign for me.
I'm a conservative man.
I run a conservative business, in spite of my wife and that's the way it's going to stay.
Mr. Hascomb, put your faith in Darrin Stephens.
If there's one man who respects the old the established, the tried and true, it's Darrin.
I'm sorry I'm late but I passed this haberdasher's and I just couldn't resist it.
Darrin, this is Mr. Hascomb of Hascomb Drug Company.
You know, I just thought of something.
Already?
Oh, this man's got a mind like a steel trap.
- Let's hear it, Darrin.
- There's no mirror in this room.
The conservative 93-year-old company, with a nice, solid, conservative image.
Young man, what are you wearing?
Love beads.
They go all the way back to ancient Egypt.
The high priests used to wear them.
High priests?
You can't get more conservative than that.
Cigarette, anyone?
Stephens, I hope you understand we want a mature, conservative campaign for our suntan lotion.
But the mature, conservative consumer doesn't hang around beaches.
Young people do.
Mr. Hascomb, which one of those pills was for tension?
The red ones.
Let's see that.
My, what an interesting box.
Darrin.
Getting back to Sunspot Tanning Lotion.
Frankly, I don't think Mr. Stephens is the man for us.
Mr. Hascomb, as one conservative to another let's reserve judgment, huh?
At least until this afternoon.
- How about cocktails?
- I don't know.
I just don't know.
I'm thirsty already.
- Shall we say 5:00, Seafarer's Lounge?
- Well Well Well, it'll give us time for a little cautious thinking.
All right.
Until 5:00, then.
Goodbye, Tate.
See you at 5:00.
Darrin, what the devil are you doing?
This wood is marvelous.
I can see myself perfectly in it.
What kind of polish do you use?
I must get some.
Hascomb drops a $500,000 account right in our laps.
No sweat, simple campaign.
You almost blow it, and all you can do is stand there and smile.
I'll have you know, these beads are very much in fashion.
- Those beads are for the birds.
- Exactly.
The birds have the right idea.
Take the peacock, for example.
The males have all the brightly colored feathers while the females are: Now, you listen to me, Cock Robin.
When you show up for that meeting, you'd better be plucked.
You hear me?
Plucked.
Honey.
Honey, open up!
Well, hi, sweetheart.
What are you doing home so early?
Did Larry give you the afternoon off?
No, I have a cocktail date at 5:00 with a very important client.
I came home to change.
Wait till you see the clothes I bought.
I look magnificent in them.
Shouldn't I be the one to tell you that?
You will, darling.
You will.
What do you think?
I think if your client is a rock 'n' roll singer you've got it made.
As a matter of fact, he's an old conservative who never got beyond the minuet.
Then why are you dressed like that?
You'll lose the account.
Sam, man cannot live by accounts alone.
I've got to be me.
Young, dashing, with it.
This isn't you.
This is Mother!
Of course.
I don't know what you' re talking about.
All I know is I'm late.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin, please.
Just wait a minute.
I'm trying to tell you something.
Mother must have zapped a vanity spell on you.
- That's why you're behaving this way.
- What way?
Vain, Darrin.
An excessive or undue pride in one's appearance.
Vain.
Just because I appreciate beauty?
Darrin, believe me, you are a victim of mother's witchcraft.
Nonsense.
Now, will you please step aside?
- You're blocking my view.
- No, I won't step aside.
Not until you change your clothes for that meeting.
Then you leave me no choice.
Good.
I'll use the mirror in the car.
Mother.
Of all the mean, low-down, spiteful Mother, I demand that you pop in here this instant and zap that spell off Darrin.
Tate, my wife, the nag, calls me a 19th century man and you know what I tell her?
- No, but I'd love to.
I tell her, "What's so hot about the 20th century"?
That's very clever.
And if my wife can't change me, what makes Stephens think he can?
He doesn't want to change you.
Believe me, he won't even try.
He'll adjust to your image.
If there's one thing about Darrin, he's adjustable.
If there's another thing about him, he's late.
- May I have one of those?
- What color?
A nice assortment would be fine.
Mother!
Well, all right.
If you won't unzap that spell, the least I can do is try to save that meeting.
Roses and posies, And daisies and weeds Come flower power, Rip off his beads Now, needle and thread, And wool and all those Weave Darrin into His regular clothes Ah, there he is, and looking just fine.
Mr. Hascomb, you're about to meet the real Darrin Stephens.
Sam did this.
She stole the clothes right off my back.
Well, never mind.
You're beautiful anyway.
Sam!
Sam!
Sam, what have you got all over you?
What have you got all over you?
Never mind my clothes.
Sam, you're a mess.
I was mixing some cake batter when I was startled by the roar of a bull moose.
- What's your excuse?
- I'm sorry I startled you.
Why don't you just zap it away, like you did with my clothes at the restaurant?
Thank you, I will.
- Now.
- Oh, no, you don't.
Not again.
Darrin, I did it for your own good.
I couldn't let you meet a conservative client dressed like a Go ahead, say it.
Like an attractive, desirable youth.
That's hardly what I was going to say.
We've got to rush.
We're expected at Larry's in an hour.
Hey, hold it.
What's this about Larry's in an hour?
We postponed the meeting with Hascomb until tonight.
He and his wife are going to be there.
If anything goes wrong this time, we'll really lose the account.
I can't wait to see myself in my new evening jacket.
I can.
- Darrin, the door's locked.
- I know, I locked it.
- Well, unlock it.
- Not yet.
I'll call you when I'm ready.
Sweetheart, I have to get dressed for dinner too.
So either open up, or slip my clothes under the door.
Here I come, ready or not.
- I'm not ready.
- Smashing, isn't it?
Blinding is the word.
It's the latest thing from Rome.
Fourteen-karat gold lamé.
Fourteen karat?
Well, it must have cost a fortune.
It did, but I'm worth it.
Well, if you're worth it, I'm worth it too.
Why should you be the only one who glitters?
How dare you use witchcraft to dress.
If you can dare gold lamé, I can dare anything.
I tell you, Sam, that dress will have to go.
It's just too much.
Too much dress?
Oh, well, I can fix that.
- More witchcraft?
- Yes, but less dress.
Sam, get rid of that dress.
I'll change if you change.
But if you're gonna shimmer in gold, I'm gonna shimmer in silver.
- This is blackmail.
- It sure is.
All right, Sam, you win this time, but I won't forget this.
Well, that's all right, sweetheart.
I'll take my chances.
Guess I'll just have to wear my old tuxedo, with the same old Sam, wait!
Don't move.
Look at that!
When you stand in a certain light, I can see myself all over your dress.
It's like a hall of mirrors.
I've never known such happiness.
Oh, Mrs. Tate, you should have seen Stephens fall into that pool.
It was like a silent-picture routine.
You should have liked that, dear.
After all, silent pictures are old-fashioned.
Just your speed.
Another hors d'oeuvre, Mrs. Hascomb?
Oh, why not.
- Emily, that's your sixth.
- Who's counting?
I am.
Tate, Stephens is late, as usual.
I wonder what he fell into this time.
Oh, I'm sure he's on his way.
I hope he gets here before my wife eats herself into a stupor.
That must be them.
It's not them.
Of course it's us.
It's tomorrow night.
The dinner's tomorrow night.
Go away.
Well, I'm sure that was Darrin's voice.
Is that you, Darrin?
Samantha?
- Oh, hi, Louise.
- Louise.
It is you, isn't it?
What magnificent creatures.
Mr. And Mrs. Hascomb, this is Darrin and Samantha Stephens.
Of course, Mr. Hascomb knows Darrin already.
Tate, I was under the impression this was to be a business dinner, not a love-in.
- Emily, get your things.
- Oh, relax, Whitney.
I can see this is gonna be a fun party.
And I think it could use some champagne.
Excuse me.
Where did you get that dress?
- It's a heavenly creation.
- How did you know?
Hascomb, do you happen to have any of those little red pills on you?
- Emily, get your things.
- Hascomb, let's not act in haste Tate, if you think I'm going to put the solid, conservative public image of Hascomb Drugs into the hands of this middle-aged hippie, you're crazy.
Oh, Mr. Hascomb, I'm very sorry to hear you say that.
Well, yes.
I have such respect for all of your products but they don't seem to get to the right people.
A pill.
My kingdom for a little red pill.
I've always told Whitney he should try to reach the younger set.
Particularly with suntan lotion.
After all, the younger the customer, the smaller the bathing suit.
And the smaller the bathing suit, the more skin that needs suntan lotion.
They're right, you know, Whitney.
Oh, you're definitely not with it.
I've pointed that out a number of times.
Emily, shut up and eat.
Mr. Hascomb, you really should listen to Darrin.
He has his finger on the pulse of today.
And his foot on the unemployment line of tomorrow.
Emily, for the last time, get your things.
Not yet, darling.
Not until you hand over the entire Hascomb Drug account to this darling young man.
I think I'm witnessing a miracle.
You're out of your mind.
Possibly.
But I'm also the major stockholder in the Hascomb Drug Company.
You gave me that gift yourself, you know, darling.
That wasn't a gift, that was a tax dodge.
Well, no matter.
Fifty-one percent is 51 percent.
And I say we take the Hascomb image out of mothballs.
And into today's scene.
Emily, I warn you.
And I also say we take you out of mothballs.
Mr. Stephens, may I borrow your beads?
Well I don't know.
I don't like to break up my ensemble.
Oh, thank you.
There, Whitney.
You already look 10 years younger.
Now, about your hair.
I could teach him to tease it.
It does wonders.
Honestly, Larry, this is what Darrin had in mind all the time.
You mean, you dressed this way to convince Hascomb to go after the young market?
Absolutely.
Darrin knew he had to do something dramatic.
Well, I've certainly got to hand it to him.
All this time, I though I thought it was just vanity.
Darrin, vain?
Why, he hasn't a vain bone in his body.
Come on, everyone, how about a toast?
Thank you.
To youth.
To the new look in Hascomb products.
To the good old days.
To the better new days.
To me.
All right, Samantha, I will take the oath.
As long as the stars remain in the sky as long as the water remains in the well I promise I will never again zap on Durwood another spell.
Now, I should like a cup of café au lait.
Oh, no.
Not so fast.
First, I want the witch's honor sign.
Oh, really, Samantha.
Don't you think you're carrying this thing a bit too far?
After all, I am your mother.
Why do you only remember that when it's convenient to you?
The witch's honor sign, please.
Oh, all right.
Witch's honor.
That's better.
Sweetheart, you're not gonna believe this but Larry just called, and he What are you doing in those clothes?
Never mind that.
What is she doing in my house?
I swear, Samantha, it was not I who did it this time.
As I was about to tell you Larry just called to say that we've got a whole slew of new clients because of the way we handled Hascomb and he insists that I dress the part.
I feel ridiculous.
Oh, well, now, never mind, sweetheart.
You look divine.
No, I don't.
I look like a jackass.
- That can be arranged.
- Mother!
Well, it's the thought that counts.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Hey, very elegant.
Thank you.
All this trouble just for Larry and Louise?
Old Chinese proverb say, "It never hurt to impress boss".
Who said that?
Confucius?
No, Charlie Chan.
Now, while you fix me a drink, I will take my cake out of the oven.
One angel food cake coming up.
I think your angel food cake went to the devil.
Arthur, what are you doing in there?
I popped in to say hi and found your cake flatter than a pancake.
Thanks to you.
You stepped on it.
I did not.
My feet weren't even in there.
Shall I tell a few jokes?
- What for?
- To get a rise out of it.
Sorry.
When you cast your spell, you probably faced west when you should have faced "yeast".
Get it?
"Faced yeast".
I really break you up, don't I?
Arthur, it isn't that I'm not glad to see you.
It's just that, well, we're having company.
So why don't you pop in tomorrow after Darrin's gone, and we can have a chat?
Not before I whip you up a new dessert.
Never mind the dessert.
You've said hi, now bye.
Oh, no, not an angel food cake.
That's so cafeteria.
Let's see.
How's the cake?
Didn't pan out.
It fell a little.
French pastry.
Perfect.
Something special.
I'll make a delicious napoleon.
A scrumptious napoleon Now gets a chance Hi, there.
Where am I?
I demand to know, where am I?
Why I am here?
Uncle Arthur, I'm a little surprised to see that you're still here.
If you want a real surprise, turn around.
Uncle Arthur, what have you done?
Well, I thought I'd whip up a little napoleon, and I got a big one.
I'm too much.
Yes, I am.
Mr. Napoleon l'm afraid there's been a slight mistake.
Can I help you?
No, sweetheart, go away.
Go away.
There's been a slight mistake.
It's partially my fault.
Arthur, it's peachy to see you, but Samantha and I are expecting guests.
So if you don't mind Who is he?
Guess.
He looks like Napoleon.
I am Napoleon.
Can't fool you, can we?
- Is this one of your practical jokes?
- Lf it were a joke, I'd be laughing.
- May I say something?
- You keep out of this.
Samantha, you're not going to tell me that this man is actually Napoleon Bonaparte.
- Okay, I won't tell you.
- But he is.
Well, make up your mind, do you wanna know or not?
I demand to be heard.
Quiet.
I can't believe it.
Yeah, it is kind of hard, isn't it?
What is he doing here?
He's our dessert?
Sam.
Well.
Shall we call you Monsieur Bonaparte or just plain old Napoleon?
Call me Emperor.
Not too friendly, are we?
I don't believe it.
In our living room, in person, sits Napoleon Bonaparte.
Yeah.
You're the only living human being who can say he's had Napoleon Bonaparte as a guest in his house.
- It's ironic.
- Ironic?
Yes.
Who can you say it to?
I thought a little humour might humour you.
Sam, how did it happen?
Well, it's sort of technical.
Well, when a witch or a warlock casts a spell involving an object in this case a French pastry the name of which may also be used to identify a human being the kinetic vibrations run the risk of zonking across the atmospheric continuum.
And the ectoplasmic manifestations which might not ordinarily occur Sam.
Sam?
- Yes, dear?
- I'm sorry I asked.
Just go inside and get rid of him.
Yes, dear.
I'll try.
You stay here.
I'll go with you.
As your biggest fan, I wanna watch.
- But if - Go.
- Mr. Bonaparte - He wants to be called Emperor.
Fine.
Emperor l'm afraid we're going to have to send you away.
I refuse to be sent anywhere unless I know where am I. I brought you here.
I'm a warlock, and my niece is a witch.
Now, Uncle Arthur, please, no need to give away the family secrets.
Will you please hurry up and send him back where he came from?
I can't reverse Uncle Arthur's spell.
- He has to do it himself.
- Don't you know anything?
Yes.
I know that my wife and I are expecting company.
And if you and your sidekick aren't out of here, I'll break your neck!
Just try it, buster, and I'll turn you into a tiny Eiffel Tower.
That I'd like to see.
Uncle Arthur, will you please reverse your spell?
Only for you.
Not for him.
Okay, Emperor, on your feet.
Stand up.
All the way.
Oh, sorry.
You're taking French leave From where you're at That's funny.
He should be gone.
Maybe you're using the wrong arm gestures.
You're a lousy warlock.
How would you know?
I'll take one more zap at Nap.
- That's Larry and Louise.
- Uncle Arthur, please hurry.
Don't rush me, Sammy.
I can't function under pressure.
Maybe you can function under a punch in the mouth.
One more word and I'm leaving.
- Sorry.
- That's the word.
Emperor, would you consider hiding in a closet?
Absolutely not.
Well, then would you meet us halfway?
Will you not say how you got here or who you are?
As your guest, I will oblige.
Because as a Frenchman, I find you so attractive.
- Get on with it.
- Yes.
Remarkable.
And very nice material.
Now, your name is Henri Richard.
You're my cousin from Paris, and we have invited you to stay for dinner.
- I don't believe this.
- You don't believe this?
More coffee, Henri?
Larry?
Larry?
- More coffee?
- Excuse me.
Yes, please.
Henri, something's been puzzling me all evening.
Is it possible that you and I have met?
I don't know.
How old are you?
- Forty-seven.
- Then it is not possible.
Somehow I find your face very familiar.
Would anybody care for brandy?
Napoleon brandy?
I'm not sure.
I'll check.
That's it.
He looks like Napoleon.
Napoleon who?
Napoleon Bonaparte.
Henri's a dead ringer for him.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Never.
Although, it flatters me to be compared to the greatest man of all time.
I hate to quarrel with my host, but he looks like Napoleon.
And that gives me a great idea.
Darrin, you know our Zoom Detergent account?
What about it?
I've just had a brainstorm for their new TV commercial.
We dress Henri like the Emperor Napoleon, and he says: "Put Zoom Detergent in your dishwater and you'll never meet your Waterloo".
- No, it won't work.
- Why not?
Well, first of all, Henri's not an actor.
Big deal.
Lots of commercials are done by nonprofessionals.
In the second place, he has to leave as soon as he can.
We'll shoot the commercial tomorrow.
And with all those residuals, you'll make a bundle of money.
And you'll be famous throughout the world.
- I will?
In Europe too?
- Wherever there's television.
But I don't understand.
What is it, television?
So the answer's no.
But my answer is yes.
I accept your proposal.
Great.
It's turned out to be a great night for all of us.
- Terrific.
- Come on, Louise.
- We're going home.
- What for?
So I can get the ball rolling for Napoleon's commercial.
- I'll let you know the time and studio.
- Larry, wait.
Good night, Sam.
Thanks for a deliciously productive dinner.
We'll see ourselves out.
Come on, Louise.
Oh, I'm sorry, Samantha, but business is business.
Henri, see you tomorrow.
Henri: Emperor, shame on you.
No pointing.
I do not permit pointing.
You knew we didn't want you to accept Larry's offer but you ignored our wishes.
- Yes, that's quite true.
And I know why.
He's got a yen for Louise.
Yeah, well, I'm sure after two centuries, you must be starved for affection.
Madame, I assure you, my motive was not to conquer a woman.
Then what was your motive?
To conquer England.
If once again I can become famous in Europe then once again can I rebuild my forces.
Sam, do something.
- Well, I - No.
No one must do nothing.
I now proclaim: If any of you tries to interfere with my arrangement with Monsieur Tate I shall tell him my Cousin Samantha is a witch.
Oh, is that ruthless.
How do you think I got to be emperor?
Well, go ahead.
Tell Monsieur Tate.
Who'd believe a man who thinks he's Napoleon?
I am Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.
England, I beat you yet.
- Sam.
- Coming.
- Hi, sweetheart.
How do you feel?
- I don't know yet.
Have you heard from your Uncle Arthur?
- No.
I guess he's still mad.
- I feel terrible.
Well, you'll feel better after breakfast.
We're having crêpe suzette.
- Crêpe suzette?
- Yeah, it was Napoleon's idea.
Why didn't you tell him he can eat what we eat, or he can go without?
Well, I didn't wanna argue with him.
You know how huffy he gets.
- Maybe that's Uncle Arthur.
- Ringing the doorbell?
Good morning.
I'm here to escort Henri to the studio.
He's due onstage in an hour.
- What's the matter, don't you trust us?
- I trust you.
But I sense in my associate a certain reluctance for this entire enterprise.
Now you mention it, after sleeping, I sincerely Hold it, Darrin.
As senior vice president, I sincerely disagree with you.
If you sincerely disagree with me, you can sincerely quit your job.
- Any questions?
- Yes.
- Shoot.
- Would you like some crêpe suzette?
I predict total disaster.
Oh, now, sweetheart, be optimistic.
- Sam, you know what I wish?
- What's that?
I wish just once these things would happen to someone else.
Not always to me.
- Great set, huh, kids?
- Yeah.
It's a room in Napoleon's palace.
Larry, are we supposed to believe that he used Zoom Detergent?
No.
But we're supposed to believe if he had his palace would have been cleaner.
Where's Cousin Henri?
- He's in his dressing room.
- Good.
Mr. Tate, Mr. Bradley's here.
- Member of the board.
- And a tough man to please.
Come on, Darrin.
Let's soften him up a bit.
Good luck.
Uncle Arthur, what are you doing in there?
You've heard of the man behind the camera.
I'm the man inside the camera.
You get out of there immediately.
And subtly.
I gotta stop hitting that brandy after dinner.
And besides, I have important news about how to reverse my spell.
You do?
What's that?
I can't reverse it.
Terrific.
That was really worth coming to tell me.
But don't worry.
I'm working on those arm gestures and I'm still in there pitching.
And striking out.
And no more bloody marys at breakfast either.
Will you please get out of here?
All right, Sammy, but in times of stress we shouldn't lose our sense of humour.
Yeah, swell.
That's it.
I'm getting back on my liver pills.
- Sam?
- Oh, yes?
Did I see you talking to a baseball player?
Who, me?
What would a baseball player be doing in Napoleon's palace?
- I guess I'm keyed up.
- Yeah.
Mr. Bradley, this is my wife, Samantha.
Oh, well, it's a pleasure, Mr. Bradley.
And may I say, I use Zoom Detergent constantly.
Well, I should hope so.
All right, Tate, let's get this show on the road.
All right, Mr. Bradley, I'm handling it personally.
All right.
Come on.
Let's get this show on the road.
Napoleon, onstage.
This is my new spokesman?
Yes, sir.
Anything wrong?
Okay, okay, it isn't exactly as I envisioned it but let's see if he can sell detergent.
All right, boys, rehearsal.
All right, just sit right over here, Napoleon.
That's it.
And read what it says on those cards.
Action.
"If you want your home to be your palace, use Zoom Detergent.
Zoom is the economy cleanser my empress, Josephine would never be without".
Wait a minute.
This guy stinks.
Am I right, or am I wrong?
- Well - I'm right.
He's an insult to a great American product.
You with the cards, out.
Tate.
- Yes, sir?
- He stinks.
- So does the commercial.
- Wait.
- The whole thing is off.
- Wait.
Is this better?
If you want your home to be your palace, use Zoom.
Henri, forget it.
- But why?
- The commercial's off.
I protest.
On what grounds has this been done to me?
On the grounds, to put it kindly, that you're wrong for the part.
I am wrong for the part of Napoleon?
Henri, take it easy.
Stop calling me that.
I am not your cousin.
I am Napoleon Bonaparte, Emperor of France.
- Putting us on, or has he flipped?
- He's putting us on.
No more lies.
Now is time for truth.
I am Napoleon.
I think he means it.
Sam, your cousin is sick.
Now, Henri, don't be a sore loser.
My name is not Henri.
My name is Napoleon.
This nut needs a psychiatrist, and so do you.
If you don't come up with a better commercial l'm taking my account to a different agency.
Darrin, I'm holding you personally responsible.
- What did I do?
- You married Samantha.
And this nut is her cousin.
Mr. Bradley, wait.
Well, what do we do now?
I don't know.
How about leaving the country?
I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to send a messenger to Larry Tate and tell him you are a witch.
You have no messenger.
Did I hear someone call for a messenger?
That's a very nice horse, Uncle Arthur, but will you get him off my carpet?
I have it.
Hooray.
It's a little late, but hooray.
I'll believe it when I see it.
You are a cynic.
And I refuse to "cynic" to your level.
Emperor, are you ready to embark?
The sooner the better.
Monsieur Stephens, I'm glad to have met you.
Likewise.
Cousine Samantha, it's been a great plaisir.
Is this gonna take long?
Well, thank you, Emperor.
And bon voyage.
Sammy, I've figured it out.
To reverse the spell, all I gotta do is pitch it with a little reverse English.
It had nothing to do with those rotten arm gestures.
Would you please get on with it?
Oh, sorry, shorty.
Would you care to step over to the fireplace, please?
Watch this, Sammy.
In reverse.
Don't you know anything?
Bat wings and lizard tails.
- I was just gonna say that.
- You Listen, fella.
In the future, when these minor incidents occur don't make such a fuss.
Please.
Now all I have to do is think of a new commercial for Zoom Detergent.
- You will, sweetheart.
You will.
- How do you know?
Because you're very talented.
Thank you.
Same to you.
Do you know what I'm happy about?
- No.
What?
- England is safe.
- There's a lovely roast in the oven.
- Roast beef.
Honey?
This isn't a roast beef.
It's a roast chicken.
I'm something else.
Sam, get rid of that delinquent warlock.
Testy, isn't he?
Uncle Arthur, out.
Good.
Aren't you gonna invite me to dinner?
I'm sorry, Uncle Arthur, but under the circumstances, I don't think so.
That roast is big enough for eight people.
- And it's going to be eaten by two.
- Selfish.
- Good riddance.
- Yeah, I wonder.
- Oh, for - Uncle Arthur?
You come back here with our dinner.
I thought you'd reconsider.
- Lf only I could bust you - Relax, Darrin.
Loosen up.
After all, a roast for eight shouldn't be "eighten" by two.
I kill me.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Hello?
Good morning, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, no, no.
I'm not busy.
Just relaxing.
Well, couldn't you come over a little later?
You see, I have to go out, and You're in the neighborhood?
At the corner drugstore?
Oh, no.
No, you know you're always welcome.
Yes.
Bye-bye.
No.
No, I'll do it myself.
There.
That's better.
Better than what?
Good morning, sweetheart.
I'll be the judge of that.
What does that mean?
It means if anything goes around here why don't you redecorate the room as an encore?
Sweetheart, that was me running around putting everything away, and Boy, am I pooped.
You should be.
It was like watching a silent movie.
It was just a little speed-up spell.
I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't been pushed to the wall.
- Who pushed you to the wall?
- Your mother.
What has my mother got to do with your ring-a-ding-ding?
Well, sweetheart, I had the living room all torn up.
I was cleaning.
She called and said she was coming.
- So?
- Well, I didn't want her to see the house looking a mess.
You know, with your mother, it's not a visit, it's an inspection.
That's not true.
If you want, I can put the mess back.
No, no.
L I guess you had good intentions.
It's just that witchcraft doesn't set too well on an empty stomach.
How about some waffles and strawberries?
- Great.
- Good.
I'll fix one for your mother too.
Shouldn't you wait until she gets here?
She'll be here any minute.
She was calling from the corner drugstore.
Holy cow.
I didn't know it was this late.
I gotta run.
I'll grab a cup of coffee and a doughnut at the office.
Darrin, don't you wanna say hello to your mother?
Not when I need a shine on my shoes and it's been two weeks since I've had a haircut.
- Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
- Samantha.
It's so nice to see you.
Thank you, dear.
And here's a little doll for that little doll.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure she'll love it.
Tabitha's out back playing.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Well, I've only got a minute, but I might have a cup of tea.
We've certainly been having a lot of dust lately, haven't we?
It must be all those soft landings on the moon.
My, Samantha, this kitchen is immaculate.
Looks like you've really been busy with your broom.
You might say that.
Would you like a cookie or something?
No.
No, thank you, dear.
Actually, I'm on my way to a bon voyage luncheon for Miriam Rogers.
She's leaving for Paris.
- How exciting.
- I should say.
- She won the trip in a contest.
- Really?
If Miriam Rogers can think of a slogan, you certainly can.
Mrs. Stephens, are you trying to tell me something?
Why, Samantha, all I'm trying to tell you is that you and Darrin should get out of the house.
- You never go anywhere.
- We don't want to go anywhere.
How about a two-week all-expense-paid trip to Tahiti?
- Tahiti?
- Here's an entry blank.
All you have to do is come up with a slogan for Tinker Bell Disposable Diapers.
Mrs. Stephens, l I'm not very much on slogans.
Give it a try.
Think, dear.
Well, okay.
What do you say about diapers, except that you keep changing them?
Well, how does this sound?
Switch to Tinker Bell Diapers.
It's time for a change.
"Switch to Tinker Bell Diapers.
It's time for a change".
Oh, Samantha, that's absolutely divine.
You'll adore Tahiti.
Start packing.
Do you really think they'll Be sure and take suntan lotion for Darrin.
Like all geniuses, he has tender skin.
Poor baby.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, my goodness.
Sam, do you remember where I put that portfolio with the layouts for Barton Industries?
Yes, I think they're down here in the hall closet.
- Thanks, honey.
- Darrin Darrin, you wanna hear something exciting?
Sure, honey.
Well, you know, about a month ago your mother mentioned a slogan contest.
It's not here.
Well, anyway, I just kind of I kind of just wrote this slogan, you know, as kind of a laugh.
Where could it be?
As I was saying Honey, I told you, never straighten my desk.
At least when it's messy, I know where everything is.
Honey, your mother sent in my slogan and you'll never believe what happened.
L I won us a trip to Tahiti.
- Great!
- Really?
I didn't think you'd This will give us another crack at the Barton account.
- Did you hear what I just said?
- Sure.
Swell.
I'll see you later.
I gotta go, honey.
Pack your own suntan lotion.
Hi, Larry.
I found the layout I drew up for Barton Industries.
- It's better than I thought it was.
- Really?
Of all the products I think the most inventive ad campaign that I have is for Tinker Bell Disposable Diapers.
Very clever, Darrin.
Thanks, Larry.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised if we got all of Barton's accounts just on the basis of this.
That may be a little difficult.
They ran a contest and came up with a rather catchy slogan.
Well, I hardly think that an amateur can compete with this material.
Well, Barton seems to like it.
Some little housewife sent it in.
- That's crazy.
- Yes.
And what's even crazier is her name: Samantha Stephens.
- Sound familiar?
- It must be a coincidence.
There's an even bigger coincidence.
We checked, and she lives at your address.
I can't believe that.
Sam wouldn't enter a contest.
She wouldn't, but she did.
The prize is two round-trip tickets to Tahiti.
And if I were you, Darrin, I would cash in the return half and invest in beachfront property.
Hi, sweetheart.
What are you doing home so early?
Larry thought I could use some time off.
Well, that's a coincidence, because I have some news Not just today.
It's kind of permanent.
- You mean you're fired?
- Right.
But why?
We seem to be having a little problem with the Barton Industries account.
- That's no reason.
- It is when my wife writes the winning slogan for one of their products.
What do Tinker Bell Diapers have to do with Barton Industries?
- Plenty.
- Well, how was I supposed to know that a company that makes computers and rockets and supersonic jets would make diapers?
Haven't you ever heard of diversification?
Yeah, but that's dumb.
Sam, if you wanted a trip to Tahiti, why didn't you say so?
If we wanna go to Tahiti, we can pay our own way.
Who wants to go to Tahiti anyhow.
That's exactly what I told your mother.
What's my mother got to do with this?
She's the one that told me about the contest and insisted that I enter.
And you twitched your nose and came up with a slogan?
- No.
- No?
No!
And out of the thousands of entries you just happened to come up with the winning slogan.
If that isn't witchcraft, what do you call it?
I'd call it imagination.
I do have some, you know.
You really expect me to believe that, don't you?
- Are you calling me a liar?
- Lf the shoe fits.
Samantha, I demand that you open this door.
Big deal.
- Hello, Darrin.
- Come to give me my severance pay?
No.
I came to apologize.
May I come in?
Why, sure, Larry.
Now, look, Darrin, you should know by now that I say a lot of things I don't mean.
- Really, Larry?
- Of course.
Everybody knows that I'm a volatile excitable, impetuous, rash, impulsive Blowhard?
That wasn't exactly the word I was looking for.
How about hysterical nut?
I'll stick with blowhard.
- You said you wanted to apologize.
- Yes.
I'm sorry for the way I behaved, and your job is waiting for you.
Larry, why the sudden switch?
What do you mean, "Why the sudden switch"?
It takes a big man to know when he's wrong and it just so happens I'm a big man.
- Well - Darrin, please don't make me beg.
It's taken a lot out of me just to apologize.
All right, Larry.
I accept your apology.
- Glad to have you back.
- Thanks, Larry.
Where's Sam?
Oh, Sam.
She's upstairs.
Why?
I just heard through my underground that Barton Industries is coming out with a new paint product.
Don't you see?
They'll need a slogan and we'll be in on the ground floor.
We can deliver the winner of the Tinker Bell Diaper contest.
Larry, I ought to bust you in your bazoo.
Now, Darrin.
- Hi, Larry.
- Oh, hi, Sam.
I just dropped by to welcome Darrin back into the firm and offer you a job.
- Me?
- Right.
To head up our slogan department.
Well, I'm flattered that you have so much confidence in me, Larry.
What's good enough for Tinker Bell Disposable Diapers is good enough for me.
It's a very flattering offer, but I'm not interested.
Don't worry about me.
You can whip up all the slogans you want.
I am no longer with the organization.
- You're not?
- That's right, Larry.
One Stephens is enough for any company.
You can consider this my resignation.
- Well, Darrin?
- Well, what?
If you're no longer with the company, would you mind leaving?
This is a closed meeting.
That tears it.
Sweetheart, Larry was just kidding.
No, no.
I wouldn't want to be in the way when you two are talking business.
Darrin Don't give it a thought, Sam.
He'll cool off.
Well, he seems pretty upset.
Larry, if this is your idea of some kind of joke I think it's very unkind.
Unkind?
How can you say I'm unkind?
I not only came to tell Darrin I was taking him back I even offered his wife a job.
Oh, good grief.
You don't come in here very often, do you?
Only when I've had a fight with my wife.
It's the same with me and I haven't missed a night in 11 years.
And that goes for birthdays, anniversaries, Christmas New Year, Armistice Day Labour Day and Groundhog Day.
Groundhog Day?
I said, " If he sees his shadow, it'll be a late spring".
And she says, " If he sees his shadow, it'll be an early spring".
Do I have to tell you?
Charlie, another double here.
When you're married to a witch, life is a little more complicated.
If you think you're married to a witch, you should see my wife.
She's got a mother that's a witch too.
When my mother-in-law comes I put a pumpkin in the window.
Hello, Darrin?
Hi, Larry.
No.
No, he's not home yet, and I'm beginning to worry.
Larry, I don't think that sitting around thinking up slogans is going to take my mind off my troubles.
Well, I just don't know.
The last time we had an argument, he went to this little bar, and l Wait Wait a minute.
That's it.
I'll talk to you later, Larry.
Bye-bye.
Hi, Clarissa.
You be a good girl and sit with Tabitha.
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Gonna offer me a drink, Darrin?
A zombie for the lady, please.
- Don't tell me that's your wife?
- That's her, all right.
Well, she doesn't look like a witch.
She is, all right.
Darrin, now you know I wouldn't have accepted that job from Larry.
Why not?
That's the way for him to get the Barton account.
The best way to get the Barton account is to show him your layouts.
They're not interested in my layouts.
They're waiting for another one of your brilliant slogans.
Darrin, why don't we go home and talk this over?
Oh, no.
I'm staying here with my friend.
Really?
That's how you solve all your problems, by witchcraft.
- I didn't even pay the cheque.
- You can do that later.
Now you can listen.
If you didn't want your zombie, you should have said so.
I wanted it.
Okay.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Thank you.
That's just what I needed to see things in their true perspective.
There you go, sweetheart.
There.
You have a good night's sleep and tomorrow you'll feel much better.
I hope.
Hello?
Oh, Larry.
Did you have to ring the phone so loud?
Did what?
I am?
I did?
It was?
But, Larry That's good news, Larry.
I'll see you later.
That was Larry.
He said Barton found my layouts on his desk this morning.
Now, Darrin You put them there, right?
Yes.
Did he like them?
What do you mean, "Did he like them"?
Didn't you rig the computer analyzer?
What analyzer?
- Then you didn't know.
- Know what?
About the consumer analyzer.
They tested your slogan on it, and it was a complete washout.
Why did they run it through an electronic machine?
Didn't they have any faith in their own judgment?
Who cares?
The point is, your slogan was rejected.
It was lousy, which proves it was your imagination.
Well, I don't think that's very nice.
Honey, you know what I mean.
Yes, I know, and I don't care.
I'm sorry, honey.
I should have known you'd never lie to me.
It's time you learned about witches.
If I didn't have to go to work, I'd love to stay home and take a couple of lessons.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Larry.
What?
Well, that's great.
Thanks, Larry.
Yeah, okay.
Bye.
How do you like that?
- Larry gave me the day off.
- Well.
I wonder what came over him.
- Yeah, so do I. - Sam.
Well, I had one free twitch coming.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
All right.
Come on.
Sweetheart, you run off and have a good time, okay?
- Okay.
- Honey, remember.
No funny business.
- Okay, Mommy.
- Promise?
- Yes.
All right.
Go on.
Morning, Mrs. Gurney.
Ladies.
- Beautiful day, isn't it?
- Lovely.
I was just telling the girls I can't believe what's happening to the price of bacon.
And red onions, don't forget the red onions.
I just don't even buy them anymore.
So my salads don't look so pretty.
- I bet you can't.
- I can too.
- You can't.
- I can.
- I dare you.
- I won't.
- I double dare you.
- No.
That proves you can't do it.
Tabitha, you promised.
No fooling around.
He dared me.
I don't care if you get a zillion dares.
You slide down a slide.
You don't slide up a slide.
- But he dared me.
- No buts.
- Now, promise.
No more.
- I promise.
All right.
Come on.
That's better.
Okay, Charlie, let's start behind the fountain.
Okay, girls.
I guess you're gonna have to clear out of here for a while.
Why?
What's going on?
Little bit to the left, Charlie.
Would Would you mind telling us what's happening?
As of tomorrow this park is officially closed.
- Closed?
- Okay, raise it a little.
- But why?
- Lady, I don't know why.
Maybe so your kids won't get in the way of the bulldozers when they start levelling off this place for the shopping centre.
What shopping centre?
But this is a public park.
It says so right on that plaque.
"Dedicated to the city by Colonel Nathan R. Mossler".
All I know is what I read in the papers.
Seems like they had a little dipsy down at city hall.
This ground was leased to the city for $1 a year and the city goofed.
They forgot to send in the dollar.
- That's terrible.
- That's life.
Young Mossler decided to take back his grandfather's park and turn it into a shopping centre.
But Charlie, let's move to the second position.
Well, the park gone, just like that.
- It's outrageous.
- They call it progress.
Well, it's wrong.
The kids need this park.
It's the only one in the neighbourhood.
There's no use getting excited.
Like they say, you can't fight city hall.
Well, I don't care what they say.
I'm going to fight, just as soon as I find out one thing.
- What's that?
- How do you fight city hall?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
Can I fix you a drink?
No, no, I can fix it myself.
No, sweetheart, I'll do it.
I'll do it.
I want you in a nice, relaxed mood when Oh-oh, what?
Oh-oh, the last time you wanted me relaxed was just before you told me that your mother had brought Tabitha a unicorn.
- Darrin, I resent that.
- So did I. Sweetheart, what I'm trying to tell you about is very, very mortal.
It's so mortal, in fact, that I don't understand it.
Okay, what is it?
Well, Tabitha and I went to the park today and I found out that starting tomorrow the park is going to be replaced with a shopping centre.
Well, that's progress, I guess.
That's what Mrs. Bentley said.
I think it's disgraceful, and I'm gonna do something.
- Honey, relax.
- Yeah, okay.
Now, listen to this.
The city leased that property for $1 a year and forgot to send the dollar.
Now doesn't that sound peculiar to you?
Not really.
Civic affairs are sometimes made up of very mysterious arrangements.
Well, they are not going to make this arrangement.
Don't you want Tabitha and the other children to have that park?
Yes.
Then you admit it's wrong to close the park.
- Well, yeah.
- Then you'll help?
- I didn't say that.
- But you will?
- Okay.
Okay.
- Good.
Now, what's the first step?
The first step?
Well, I guess the first step would be to make an appointment with your councilman.
- That's what Mrs. Gurney said.
- And?
- We have an appointment.
- Good.
On Tuesday, April 15, 1997.
- What?
- At 2:30.
Come on, Sam.
Well, honey, it might as well be.
His calendar's booked up to six weeks in advance.
So how about step two?
Well, if you can't see your councilman I guess the next step is to take your case to the people.
- The people?
- You know, organize.
You You mean organize a protest march or something?
You have to be careful how you go about - With picket signs and all that stuff?
- Just a minute.
You're right.
I'm going to do it.
Why, there must be a hundred mothers who feel just as angry as I do about losing that park.
They just need a leader.
Someone who'll fight to the last blade of grass to the last grain of sand in the sandbox.
It's just Willow Street Park, not Dunkirk.
I know.
I know, but that's just the way I feel.
It's a matter of principle, a question of integrity.
You know, I'm very proud of you.
Most people accept things just the way they are.
They hope somebody else does something about it.
You know something?
You're a witch in a million.
Well, thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm sorry, but we are not moving, not one inch, are we, ladies?
We want our park, so you get out of here now.
Ladies, please, for the last time, okay?
Please move out of the way.
You're trespassing on private property.
All right, ladies, close ranks.
Mrs. Stephens, look this way.
That's it.
Look mad.
Good.
Ladies, please.
What do you want me to do, lose my job?
You want me to lose my job.
Okay.
You've had it.
You've had it.
That's it.
That's it.
We're through.
Ready or not, I'm going through.
That's it.
You wouldn't dare.
Oh, yeah?
Just watch my dust, all right?
Okay, Jeff, follow me, nice and slow.
What the?
Looks like somebody somewhere is on our side.
You want me to call the cops?
No, you better call the boss.
Let him sweat it out.
I've had it.
I've made enough enemies down here let alone up there.
Here comes Mossler.
This will be good.
Well, well, what's going on here?
Got a little problem, have we?
Yes, I'll say we have.
- Those mothers won't budge.
- Say we have no right to close the park.
Oh, well, they just don't know all the facts.
Who's the leader?
The blond one in the middle.
- Let me show you how to handle this.
- Good.
Hi, there.
My name's Harlan Mossler.
I'm the owner of this property.
There seems to be a little misunderstanding.
It could get bigger.
Now wait a minute.
I'm a family man myself.
I love kids.
Well, then, kindly ask these gentlemen to vacate the premises and we'll all be happy.
- Yeah.
- Give it to him, Samantha.
- Hit him where it hurts.
Okay, boys.
Let's call it a day.
You're giving up?
You're gonna let us have the park?
No, no, on the contrary.
I need time to get a court injunction which means if you persist in obstructing these men l'm gonna have each of you thrown in jail.
Now, if you'll pardon me, I must be rushing on.
Nice chatting with you.
What are we gonna do now?
We're gonna keep right on picketing.
Didn't you hear?
He said he's gonna have us thrown in jail.
Yes, I know.
I know, but don't worry.
- There's always step three.
- What's that?
I don't know.
But I'll think of something.
Darrin, you old son of gun, we've done it again.
This Easy Way Rent-A-Car presentation is a masterpiece.
Just don't hog all the credit this time, huh, Lar?
- Let's make it 50-50 right down the line.
- Done.
I'll even go you one better, Darrin.
If H.B. Doesn't like it, it's all yours.
I wonder where he is?
It isn't like him to be late.
Must be him now.
Yes?
Good.
Send him on in.
Now remember, all smiles.
That's how happy we are about our presentation.
- Thank you.
- Come in.
Come in, H.B. - You know Darrin Stephens.
- Yes, Stephens.
I'm sorry to be late.
I had some business to attend to.
Everything all right I hope?
Yes.
I saw to that.
Can you imagine?
Women were picketing the site of my new shopping centre.
We never should have given them the vote.
Troublemakers, that's what they are.
Like I always say, give the housewives all those modern appliances and they have more time on their hands than they know what to do with.
Right, Darrin?
Yes.
Yes, indeedy.
Sam.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
How goes the battle?
You're not gonna believe what happened today.
I think I will.
It's not all good.
I'll believe that too.
Well, what happened was we won today's battle but tomorrow the war may get a little sticky.
The owner of the property said he's gonna get an injunction.
And if we show up tomorrow, he's gonna have us all thrown in jail.
- Can he do that?
- I was afraid that might happen.
There's only one thing to do.
- Stay in there and fight, right?
- Wrong.
I suggest an immediate and strategic retreat.
I refuse to be intimidated.
I'm gonna keep right on going.
You're gonna keep right on going, all right, to jail.
I don't care.
And now that I have whipped up my courage I think I'll finish whipping up dinner.
I know, honey.
It's an admirable cause, admirable.
But the fact remains the city goofed and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
You women are trespassing on private property.
Darrin, I told you.
I am perfectly willing to go to jail, if that's what it takes.
Sweetheart, you've got to look at the whole picture.
Step back and look at the big canvas.
A lot of people stand to benefit from a shopping centre.
And let's not forget, the city has a budget problem.
It needs all the property taxes it can collect.
Darrin, what's gotten into you?
You're the one that told me I should stand up for my principles no matter what.
- Yes, of course, and it still goes.
Except that every once in a while a bigger principle comes along that's even more important.
Like what?
Like the principle of providing food and shelter for one's loved ones.
Darrin, how about telling me what you're not telling me?
Sam, do you happen to know who Harlan Mossler is?
Yes.
He's a very selfish man.
If he is, it's his hobby.
He makes his living as the owner of Easy Way Rent-A-Car one of McMann & Tate's biggest clients.
What does that got to do with it?
He's also the owner of the SavMost Market chain.
Good.
- I'm glad you told me.
- I thought you would be.
Now I can tell my fellow protesters not to shop there.
- And then there's - I thought we dropped it.
- Listen to me.
- It's no use.
My mind is made up.
I forbid you to go down to that park tomorrow!
- Hypocrite.
- Sorehead.
Sam?
Sam, are you in the kitchen?
Look, Sam.
Enough "Breakfast on table.
Aunt Hagatha babysitting in nursery.
I'm at the park sitting in front of a bulldozer.
Over.
Down with hypocrites".
Good morning, Darrin.
And don't give me that " Larry, what are you doing here"?
routine.
Larry, what are you doing here?
Then you haven't seen the morning paper?
No, why?
Look for yourself.
I underlined the part that says: "The leader and organizer is Mrs. Darrin Stephens".
Well?
Well, I must say Sam takes an excellent picture.
Is that all you can say?
Your wife is biting the hand that feeds us and all you can say is that?
Come on, Larry.
So Sam's all fired-up about something that's important to any mother.
- It'll blow over.
- Sure, it will.
What's Sam trying to do, put us out of business?
Larry, take it easy.
Even if Mossler sees the paper, he's not gonna read the fine print.
Maybe that's Sam now.
- Hello?
- Stephens.
This is Harlan Mossler.
I've just been looking at the morning paper.
Hi, there, Mr. Mossler.
- Yes, I know all - Let me talk to him.
Hi, H.B. Larry Tate here.
I was just dropping by to pick Darrin up.
What seems to be the problem?
What's that?
No, I had no idea.
Samantha Stephens?
Furthermore, she's right back at it this morning.
Now, Tate, all I've got to say is there had better be an explanation.
Don't worry about a thing, H.B. Stephens is on his way out the door right now.
Says who?
Now, now, Darrin, no offence.
Look, I'm married to a real nut myself.
- Larry, let's not get personal - Now, now, you know what I mean.
Sam's so upset about losing a little park that she doesn't realize she's standing in the way of progress.
She should step back, take a look at the overall picture.
After all, a lot of people stand to benefit from a shopping centre.
That's just what I told Sam.
There, you see?
Then we agree.
- No, no, we don't.
- But you just said that When I said that to Sam, I didn't like the sound of it.
And when I hear it from you, I like it even less.
If knocking down a park for a shopping centre is progress l'm a monkey's uncle!
- Watch it, Darrin.
With those long arms, you're leaving yourself wide open.
I don't care.
I'm going down there.
Attaboy.
Now, you're talking.
I'll say I am.
I'm gonna give Sam all the moral support I can, late as it is.
First, I'll get dressed.
Mrs. Stephens?
Your husband will be here in a few moments.
And if he's not man enough to handle his wife's behaviour then he's not man enough to handle my advertising account.
- That's blackmail.
- No, that's sound business.
Hi, honey.
Mr. Mossler.
Ladies.
If you two would like to chat I'll give you exactly one minute.
- He can do it in 30 seconds.
- It won't take that long.
You don't have to say a word.
I've decided to back down.
No, you're not.
You're gonna stay right here and fight.
Stephens, is this some kind of monstrous joke?
What are you doing?
Like the sign says, happy children mean a happy tomorrow.
- Stephens, that does it.
- Yes, Stephens.
As of this moment, you are no longer with McMann & Tate.
Fine.
That's just fine with me.
I'm sorry.
Nothing personal, but business is business.
Right, H.B.?
Right is right and wrong is wrong and never the Tate, will you stop babbling?
Right.
I'm with you, H.B. We've said enough already.
Mr. Mossler, before you do anything drastic l'd like to ask you one question.
What's that?
Your grandfather there, the one who said happy children mean a happy tomorrow what do you think he'd say if he knew you were closing this park for your own selfish gain?
- Forget it, honey.
You can't reach him.
- Now, wait a minute.
I want to hear what Mr. Mossler has to say.
Really, Mrs. Stephens, whatever my grandfather may say is irrelevant.
I'm not surprised at you, Harlan.
I guess it's my fault, because I gave you too much.
Sam, what's the matter with him?
I guess he's thinking it over.
- Did you see that?
- See what?
What?
- What's the matter, H.B.?
- Nothing.
The sun must be hotter than I think.
You were a spoiled brat as a child and now you're a greedy, spoiled brat as a man.
- Don't you hear anything?
- No.
Hey, stand up straight when I'm talking to you.
- Are you all right, H.B.?
- Yes.
I've been thinking about these fine ladies and their fine children and the need for this park that my grandfather so graciously donated.
- I was thinking about that too.
- Mrs. Stephens, ladies I have reconsidered this matter.
And in the tradition of the late Colonel Nathan "Ramrod" Mossler although it costs me great personal loss I hereby rededicate this park to the children of this community.
Beautiful.
Think of the mileage we can get out of the publicity.
Oh, Tate, will you shut up?
Mr. Mossler, somehow I always knew that deep down you were a Mossler through and through.
And, Stephens, I hereby award you all the advertising accounts of Mossler Enterprises.
Thank you, sir.
If you'll excuse me, ladies.
I have to run now.
Let's go!
We won.
You did it.
Well, welcome back to McMann & Tate.
I don't know, Larry.
With the entire Mossler account, I could start my own agency.
I only said that you were no longer with us in the hope that Mossler would realize what a selfish stand he was taking.
- Larry, would you like to explain that?
- No.
Okay, Larry, everything's back to normal.
Thanks to you, you son of a gun.
You know, I wonder what came over him to make him change his mind?
- I wonder.
- Me too.
Honey?
Sam, what's the matter?
Nothing.
It was just the sun.
Must be hotter than I think.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
All right, Tabitha.
Now, listen to this.
She's a very special doll.
- My name is Baby Whisper.
- Cute, huh?
Did you make her talk, Mommy?
No, sweetheart, mortals did.
They're catching up with us, Tabitha.
Let me make her talk, Mommy.
Okay.
Pull the string.
- I'm very, very hungry.
- Let's feed her.
Yeah, well, we would, but we're fresh out of doll food.
I'm very sleepy too.
She's right.
It's time for her nap and yours.
I'm not sleepy, she is.
Well, let's put her to bed and while we're up there, you lie down next to her.
I'm a big girl now.
I can put myself to bed.
Well, all right.
Come on.
But one peep out of either one of you, and I'm coming right up, okay?
Okay, Mommy.
I lik e you.
Uncle Arthur, what are you doing in there?
You turn me on.
You better come out, or I'll turn you off.
How about a kiss, baby?
Do you really want a kiss, or are you just stringing me along?
Very good, Sammy.
You're learning from your Uncle Arthur.
And now let me get a good look at you.
My, you're putting on a little weight.
Not very nice, Sammy.
I laughed at your joke, bad as it was.
Anyway, I'm really here to see Tabitha.
I brought the little princess a birthday present.
- But it's not her birthday.
- I know.
It's his.
Uncle Arthur.
- He's adorable.
Where'd you get him?
- In a thunderstorm.
It was raining cats and dogs.
And you stepped in a poodle.
Not bad, Sammy.
It'd have been funnier if I'd said it.
- I hope he's trained.
- Only to kill.
Oh, hi, Louise.
What a pleasant surprise.
Pleasant?
My whole world is crumbling.
I'm crushed, destroyed.
I guess "pleasant" wasn't exactly the right word.
May I come in for a while?
I wanna talk to you.
- Of course.
- Thank you, Samantha.
You're my only friend.
You may not believe this, Samantha.
It's gonna come as quite a shock to you, but Oh, I didn't know you had company.
- Louise, you know my Uncle Arthur.
- Of course.
How are you?
Hi.
Excuse me for not getting up, but my feet are killing me.
How nice.
There's still some humour left in this world.
Even if it's bad.
Fortunately, I didn't hear that.
Where's my fella?
Now, Louise, you just come right in here.
Sit down, take off your shoes, relax and tell me all about it.
Oh, it's nothing really.
It's just that my marriage to Larry has come to an end.
I mean it, Samantha.
I never wanna see Larry again as long as I live.
Well, I've heard all about that, Louise.
What you haven't told me is what started all this.
A volleyball game.
A volleyball game?
Yesterday, we went to the beach to visit some friends and we decided to play volleyball.
Well, Larry was a captain, and he picked his side.
- So?
- Don't you understand, Samantha?
My own husband didn't pick me!
Louise, volleyball is not grounds for divorce in this state.
Larry, it's your fault.
Why didn't you pick her for your team in the first place?
- Because I wanted to win.
- That's no reason.
Oh, no?
Have you ever seen Louise play volleyball?
- Her best shot is ducking.
- Larry, you don't understand.
To a wife, it's not how she plays the game, it's who picks her.
Sure.
Sure.
Now you've got all the answers.
But where were you when we chose up sides?
Oh, Samantha, do you mind if I go upstairs and lie down?
That's a good idea, Louise.
You rest a while, and we'll talk later.
You stay right there, fella.
Sammy, I've got to go.
I don't wanna be late for the ostrich derby.
I'm riding the favourite.
Now, make up your mind.
Are you gonna keep the puppy I brought for Tabitha or not?
That's not an easy question, Uncle Arthur.
A dog is a big responsibility, for the whole family.
Personally, I'd love to keep him, but I can't speak for Darrin.
- Of course you can.
- No.
You see, you don't understand.
That's the way it is with Darrin and me.
We respect each other's wishes.
Darrin can't speak for me and I can't speak for Darrin.
Go on, Sammy.
Tell me again you can't speak for Darrin.
Uncle Arthur, it's not funny!
Well, it's just a little practical joke.
What's happened to your sense of humour?
It's gone, with my voice!
Now, put it back!
Oh, all right, all right, Sammy.
Don't get all steamed up.
Your voice is back.
Go ahead.
Speak, killjoy.
Uncle Arthur, your i Idea of joy is my idea of a double-cross.
Honest, Sammy, I meant to put your voice back, and I will if I can find it.
Another double.
Come on, Larry.
Another double isn't going to help anybody.
Except the bartender.
Look at the tab I've run up.
You should be out right now looking for Louise.
What the devil happened to your voice?
I think I have a frog in my throat.
- Yeah.
A girl frog.
- I'll see you later, Larry.
Uncle Arthur, you've done some pretty dumb things in your time but this takes the cake.
I'm sorry, Sammy.
If you want me to concentrate, don't talk.
You break me up.
I'm sorry, Samantha.
Honest.
I'm trying.
I just can't figure out where your voice went.
- Sam?
Sam?
- There it is.
You!
That explains everything.
Look what he's done to me.
Samantha, say something.
Yes.
Yes, Sammy.
Say something.
Come on, Sam!
Let's not make a big thing out of this, Darrin.
But it figures.
If you've got Sammy's voice, she'd naturally have yours.
- You've got mine?
- I'm afraid so, sweetheart.
- You're not an uncle.
You're an ogre.
- What are you so excited about?
This speaks well of your marriage.
What's yours is hers, and what's hers is yours.
Look, I may have Sam's voice, but I still have my own fist.
You wave that fist at me once more, and I'll bronze it right on your wrist.
Darrin, sweetheart.
Uncle Arthur, it was a very funny joke, and we all enjoyed it.
Didn't we, sweetheart?
Yeah.
All right.
Let's break the spell.
Screech, hoot owls Toot, ferry boats Hold it.
Is it "ferry boats" or "nanny goats"?
I can't remember.
- Just ignore it.
- Now, where was I?
You were deciding between "ferry boats" and "nanny goats".
Samantha, wasn't that the doorbell?
No, Louise.
I don't think so.
Oh, Darrin, I didn't know you were home.
Louise?
What's she doing here?
If you brought that beast of the volleyball court with you you just tell him from me, I'm not here.
- Get on with it.
- Let's not get huffy.
Sweetheart.
Please, Uncle Arthur?
That's better.
Screech, hoot owls Toot, ferry boats Darrin.
If you won't answer the door, at least answer the window.
Oh, I'm sorry to intrude, but I've got to talk to you, man-to-man.
Come on in.
Join the party.
Can't talk?
Laryngitis?
Samantha, was that Larry's voice I heard?
Darrin, you've got Louise in there.
Traitor!
That is Larry!
You did bring him home!
Well, you can just tell him from me, I'm not here!
Louise, Larry knew you were here.
He just Can't talk, eh?
What are you trying to do, make a monkey out of me?
- That's a fun thought.
- Uncle Arthur, don't you dare!
Darrin, if Louise wants to stay here you can have her, but you're no friend of mine.
You're not even my employee, you Benedict Arnold!
You old meanie!
Fired.
I've lost my job, I've lost my voice and now I think I'm losing my mind.
Sweetheart, just hold on a little bit longer.
It'll all work out.
Uncle Arthur: Screech, hoot owls And toot, ferry boats?
Now, just a second.
You both are forgetting one important thing.
There's a little puppy outside, all alone waiting for a little girl like Tabitha to love him.
Listen to him ranting about puppies at a time like this!
- Puppies count too.
- And I am going to count to three.
Screech, hoot owls And toot, ferry boats Voices, hightail it To each other's throats This better be it.
It is it!
I'm me again!
You did it, Uncle Arthur.
Sammy, you've got my voice, and I've got yours!
Well, as long as it's in the family.
What's so funny?
Everybody having a party?
Not everybody, just Uncle Arthur.
Well, Larry's gone.
At least that's one thing to celebrate.
Samantha, I just have to talk to you, woman-to-woman.
Oh, Louise.
Sam can't talk woman-to-woman right now.
Since when do you speak for Samantha?
Since about 10 minutes ago.
What'd you say, Samantha?
Talk to me, Louise.
I can be very understanding when I try.
- And I'm really going to try.
- Well, I don't wanna talk to you.
In fact, I don't wanna talk to any of you.
You're all against me.
Uncle Arthur, if you don't straighten us out I am going to scream so loud and so long you're gonna be hoarse for a month.
All right, all right.
We'll try something different.
I know a million of them.
Cauldrons bubble And slow gin fizz Restore to each The v oice that's his And hers There.
If this is another one of your tricks Worrywart.
Go ahead, Sammy.
Testing.
One, two.
I liked it better before.
The fun's gone out of this party.
- Why don't you follow it?
- Sammy, before I leave, ask him.
Sweetheart, Uncle Arthur came to give Tabitha something.
What, a hotfoot?
My good man, you underestimate me.
I stopped giving hotfoots Congratulations and goodbye.
Well, the least you can do is shake hands.
Okay.
Sam, he's your uncle.
Do something with him, something terrible!
That's gratitude for you.
My puppy and I are leaving.
There's my little killer.
I knew that incantation would work.
I just hope it sticks.
- What'd he mean by that?
- Nothing I hope.
I'll send for my things.
Louise, where are you going?
- I know when I'm not wanted.
- Louise.
I think it's time for our little woman - to-woman talk.
That's Darrin's voice, and it's coming out of your mouth.
Louise, don't believe everything you hear.
That's Samantha's voice coming out of your mouth!
Louise, believe me, there's a logical explanation for all this.
Yes, there is.
I'm going out of my mind, and I'm getting out of this house.
Oh, Larry, am I glad to see you.
No, no.
I'm the one who's glad to see you.
And I apologize.
I've thought it over, and I really am an insensitive boob.
Well, maybe you are, but you're my insensitive boob, and I need you.
- Let's go get your things.
- I'm not going back in that house.
There's something weird going on in there.
Darrin's voice is coming out of Samantha and Samantha's is coming out of Darrin.
You poor kid.
You really did miss me, didn't you?
- They're coming in.
- Duck!
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
Nothing can happen.
Daddy Bear is here.
- Well, I'm glad somebody's happy.
- Uncle Arthur isn't.
- I don't know what to do.
- Why don't you try apologizing?
What are you doing in that picture?
I've been framed.
- You get down here this instant.
- Yeah.
Hanging's too good for you.
Sammy, I feel another pout coming on.
Uncle Arthur, Darrin Uncle Arthur, Darrin didn't mean it, really.
You did a beautiful job of getting our voices back.
Now Now if you could just get them to stick.
Stick!
That's it!
I just forgot the stickum.
Sammy, Darrin, join hands.
- Hurry up.
- Just leave the goals to me.
Voices be nimble Voices be quick Voices return, and this time Stick, stick, stick - And don't come back.
- I heard that.
We're stuck!
Watch your step, pussycat.
- We don't want you hurting yourself.
- Yes.
Goodbye, Samantha.
Goodbye, Darrin.
And thank you.
- Thanks for nothing.
- Lar.
Lar!
Larry, can I talk to you for a minute?
So the cat gave you back your tongue?
- Oh, Larry, darling, be kind.
- Oh, all right.
But I'm only doing it for you, my flower blossom.
- What is it?
- Over here, Larry, please.
Larry, this whole thing can be explained.
I'm listening.
What Darrin means is that he's glad that our plan worked, for your sake.
- What plan?
- Tell him, Sam.
You know, the plan to make Louise feel rejected so that she'd wanna go back to Larry.
Right.
That plan.
- Don't give me that.
- Louise, didn't you feel rejected?
- I certainly did.
- See?
It worked.
You mean you?
You really did that for us?
For you and Louise.
And for your marriage.
That's what really counts.
Gee, Darrin, l I don't know what to say.
You son of a gun.
Put her there.
- It's the old football-huddle shake.
- Yeah.
Hurry, love.
Time's flying.
You son of a gun.
- You know what caused this?
- What?
Three dumb little words from you to Uncle Arthur: "Don't come back".
Oh, I guess I shouldn't have said that.
Yeah.
Well, there's one consolation: If I have to be stuck with someone, I'm glad it's you.
You son of a gun.
The water's boiling so when I lift up the lid, you put in the spaghetti, okay?
No, it isn't okay!
How can anything be okay when we're stuck together like this?
Sweetheart, look at the bright side.
We do believe in togetherness, don't we?
Yeah, but this is ridiculous.
Don't worry.
Uncle Arthur will show up and unstick us.
- Sure.
- Let's not forget he wouldn't have stuck us together if you hadn't insulted him.
- He's rather thin-skinned.
- And thick-skulled.
There you go again.
Now, you're just gonna have to learn to understand Uncle Arthur.
He's really very sweet.
I can remember, when I was a little girl he taught me how to make my first pony.
Now, anybody who did that can't be all bad.
Hold it.
I'm not boiling yet.
He's in there!
Quick, turn the heat up!
Darrin.
If there's one place you'll never find me it's in hot water.
Over here.
Isn't that sweet?
Married five years, and still holding hands.
Yeah.
All right.
Uncle Arthur, you've made your point.
Please?
Oh, all right.
Hands be nimble Hands be quick Prepare yourselves And now unstick - Thank you, Uncle Arthur.
- You don't have to thank me, Sammy but he does.
Unless you wanna be married to a 170-pound artichoke.
Thank you.
And I mean it.
Strange as it may seem, you're the best friend I have in Sam's family.
Even with your practical jokes I know you really love us and mean well Let's not get sticky.
But you know, Sammy even though he is a party pooper, I like him.
Too bad he doesn't have a little more sense of humour.
Here's $50 worth.
Don't you get it, dum-dum?
"Cents" of humour.
If you think that's funny, you're gonna love this.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
There you are, Tabitha.
You look very pretty.
Now, sweetheart, do you remember what I told you?
To thank Grandma Stephens for my birthday surprise.
- That's right.
- But it isn't really my birthday.
It's Grandma Stephens' early birthday surprise.
Now, what else did I tell you?
Be real polite and don't fly.
- Yes.
Now, what else?
- I forget.
We mustn't do any witchcraft.
That's very important.
No witchcraft is very important.
Do you know why these things are important?
Well, you see, Grandma Stephens does not use witchcraft and she does not fly.
- Oh, she's sick?
- Tabitha flying doesn't come naturally to most Well, you see, the difference between us and No.
No, she's not sick.
Is Grandpa Stephens coming to dinner too?
No.
He had to fly to Cleveland on business.
I'm glad Grandpa Stephens could fly.
I mean, he took an airplane.
Oh, is he sick too?
Tabitha, I realise these things are hard for you to understand but Grandma Stephens is downstairs right now so if you're real good, you can have two pieces of cake.
- Okay?
- Okay, Mommy.
The dinner was delightful, Samantha, and so is the cake.
- Thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
- I'm being good.
- Yes, you are, dear.
- I'm not flying or anything.
Of course you're not flying, Tabitha.
Anyway, I want to give Tabitha her birthday present a little in advance.
- I get two pieces of cake.
- Just a minute, dear.
Because the semester begins tomorrow.
- Semester?
What semester?
- The nursery school semester.
Surprise.
Grandma's paid Tabitha's tuition at nursery school.
Cake, please.
What a nice surprise.
But Samantha and I were just discussing nursery school, and And we We decided to wait until next year for kindergarten.
- We just don't think that she's ready.
- Cake, please.
Isn't ready?
With her imagination and hidden talents waiting to bloom?
- Please, cake.
- Just a moment, dear.
I know all the arguments, Darrin, but they point to overprotectiveness.
Our Tabitha is unique.
She is an exceptional child.
All these traits run in the Stephens' family.
But let's not deny her the companionship of other children.
No, never.
We mustn't do that.
I'm glad you agree.
She is a gifted child but we must never let her think she's different.
And now, dear, let Grandma Here's your second piece of cake.
How did that cake get over here?
Mrs. Stephens, a gifted child like Tabitha just calls upon her hidden talents.
It's good.
Yes, and nursery school is good too, dear.
You'll love it.
They play games, finger paint, model with clay sing songs Sam, how about measles?
Thanks, sweetheart, but not this morning.
I mean as an excuse for my mother.
Tabitha couldn't go to nursery school if she had the measles.
Your mother's already on her way over.
And I told you, I had a little talk with Tabitha.
She knows how to behave.
- I hate to admit it, but I don't trust her.
- Darrin.
Nobody could trust me at that age, and I wasn't a witch.
Will you relax?
Your mother wants to do some shopping, but somehow l'll get out of it so I can stay with Tabitha.
Great.
But what about tomorrow?
Do me a favour.
One day at a time, please.
- Will you try and calm down?
- Sam, you're not talking to a man you're talking to a nerve ending, and nerve endings can't calm down.
Have a little faith in me.
I'm a witch too.
I know.
I know.
And Tabitha Stephens will simply love Delightful Day Nursery School.
- Won't you, Tabitha?
- Yes, Mrs. Burch.
Tabitha, you're just a peach.
She's just a peach.
Oh, they're playing choo-choo before morning juice.
That's a no-no at Delightful Day.
- Hi, I'm Amy.
- I'm Tabitha.
- Gee, you're little.
- I'm not little.
You're big.
Hello.
I'm Ruth Taylor.
Does your little girl have any diseases?
- Why, no.
- Good.
My Amy is very susceptible to everything.
Hello, Mrs. Taylor.
Good morning, Amy.
- Hi.
- All right, children.
Let's say goodbye to our mothers and go on into the playroom.
Come along.
That's it, Tabitha.
Dear me.
Mrs. Burch, where should I stay?
- Stay?
- Stay?
We're going shopping, Samantha.
I decided I'd just sort of stay here at school, if you don't mind.
- Oh, I'd love to have you, dear.
- Thank you.
But unfortunately it's against the rules.
I understand.
It's difficult to see the little one fly from the nest.
I'm not supposed to fly.
Her vivid imagination comes from my side of the family.
- Shall we go, Samantha?
- Oh, I can't possibly leave her now.
- Why not?
- I haven't said goodbye yet.
Now, Tabitha, I'm afraid that Mommy's gonna have to leave for a while.
- Okay.
What some mothers don't realise is that I'm an expert in my field.
I have found, after 27 years, that no child is essentially different from any other child.
If you want a toy you ask Mrs. Burch and then pick it up.
- No zapping, okay?
- Okay, Mommy.
Yeah.
And another thing All right, dear.
There are so many ways you can say goodbye but the best one is, "Goodbye, Tabitha.
Goodbye, Mrs. Burch".
Now come along, Samantha.
A little shopping will calm your nerves.
Your mommy has made us all late for game time.
Come along, Tabitha.
All right, children, what do we do next?
Tabitha?
- Play games.
- And why do we play games?
Amy.
- Because.
- No.
We play games to win.
- My cat eats flowers.
- Okay.
Amy, Tabitha, Mrs. Burch is talking.
Did you hear what Mrs. Burch said?
"Uh-huh" will never do here.
It's "Yes" or "No, Mrs. Burch".
Yes or no, Mrs. Burch.
We mind our tongues at Delightful Day Nursery School.
But I warn you, Tabitha, I've moulded all kinds.
All right, class, get your chairs, bring them in a circle and we'll play musical chairs.
- She talks mean.
Yeah.
And the blue here is a genuine copy of a Paris original.
- Oh, really?
- Why don't you try it on, Samantha?
We're dealing with a nervous mother.
Her little girl started nursery school today.
Oh, I understand, Mrs. Stephens.
But there's no better tonic for nursery school jitters than a new dress.
- I'm not nervous.
Oh, go ahead, Samantha, try it on.
That is a good idea.
I'll try it on.
And this one, and this one, and this one, and this one.
Shopping may be just what I needed after all.
All right, Steven, sit down.
Now, class, you have before you the two best Musical Chairs players.
Soon, we will have just one best Musical Chairs player.
Remember, it is not bad to lose, but it's grand to win.
And the winner will receive this lollipop.
Which one of you is going to win?
- Me.
- Me!
All right, let's see.
Come on.
Hop up.
That's it.
All right, students.
Compete.
- Oh, hi.
- Why, Mrs. Stephens.
All this time, I thought you were out shopping.
Oh, I am.
I mean, I was.
L I mean, I'm going.
I'm going right now.
- Bye.
- Goodbye.
Samantha, how do they look?
Did you find anything you like?
Samantha?
- Well, that's strange.
- What's the matter?
Nothing.
Not a thing.
- I didn't care for any of them.
- You didn't?
No.
They're just not me.
- Could I try five more, please?
- Five more?
Better yet, make it 10.
All right, Mother Nature wants her little forest to form.
Sycamores, mushrooms.
Oh, very good, sycamores and mushrooms.
Tabitha, you be the bunny.
Robert, you're the butterfly.
- Amy, the toad.
- I wanna be the butterfly.
We don't argue with Mother Nature, Amy Catherine Taylor.
- You are the toad.
- But I wanna be the butterfly.
Anyone who spills her juice at snack time cannot be the butterfly.
If the forest will please excuse me, Mother Nature is wanted on the phone.
Mrs. Burch speaking.
- Don't cry, Amy.
- But I wanna be the butterfly.
- But toads are nice.
- I wanna be the butterfly.
Okay.
Now you won't cry anymore, Amy.
All right, forest.
Let's take our places.
Amy?
Where's our little toad?
Get out of here.
Amy?
Amy.
I know you're a good little hider, but come out.
- What is it, Tabitha?
- Excuse me, Mrs. Burch only there she goes.
I see the butterfly, Tabitha, but I'm looking for a child.
Amy.
Amy Catherine Taylor.
Amy, you come out from where you're hiding this instant.
Because you can't be a butterfly is no reason to hide.
You gonna try all these on?
I'm a very thorough shopper.
Thank you.
Her daughter started nursery school today.
Yeah, you told me.
Amy, you are not, I repeat you are not allowed to vanish into thin air at Delightful Day Nursery School.
Amy, you're a good hider, but olly, olly, oxen free!
- Tabitha.
- All right, now l've just had enough of this.
Amy, where are you?
Tabitha, did something happen to Amy?
- She was crying.
- Why?
Mrs. Burch wouldn't let her be a butterfly.
- And?
- I let her be a butterfly.
Tabitha, you didn't!
- You did.
- I hate people to cry, Mommy.
I know you thought you were doing a good thing but people don't understand our kind of help.
- Where's Amy now?
- She's up in that tree.
- You sure?
- That's where I saw her flew.
- Fly.
- No, she flew.
Okay.
Okay, flew.
But she's too far away for you to change her back.
I'll go get her.
Okay, Mommy.
Is this one of those things that's called a problem?
Not exactly, sweetheart.
This is one of those things that's called a catastrophe.
Amy.
Amy.
I'm Tabitha's mommy.
You remember me?
You saw me in the office earlier.
Amy, be a good girl and come to Samantha.
Excuse me, lady.
I'm not gonna ask you how you got up there.
I'm gonna ask you why you're up there.
Oh, I'm trying to catch my butterfly.
That's a straightforward answer.
Now I'm gonna ask you how you got up there.
I used to live in the woods.
I just love to climb trees.
And I suppose you hung around with Smokey the Bear too.
Really, it's very important that I catch my butterfly.
And the butterfly's name is Amy?
Yes, Amy.
Amy the butterfly.
Cute.
Now, would you do me a favour, lady?
- Will you get out of my tree?
- Really, mister Amy's a very rare butterfly.
There might even be a reward for her capture.
A reward?
For the butterfly?
Amy the butterfly, come on down.
Come on.
Daddy loves you.
Come on.
- Come out of the tree.
Yes.
- There she goes.
You keep an eye on her.
I'll get my binoculars.
If she's on this planet, my binocu Something weird about that dame.
All right, Amy.
You come out, and you come out right this instant.
I've had enough of this wilful disobedience.
We run a tight ship here, and this is insubordination.
- And you'll be severely punished.
- Mrs. Burch?
- What is it, Tabitha?
- Amy's up in the tree with my mommy.
Thank you, Tabitha.
I needed that bit of information.
Amy Catherine Taylor.
Oh, why, Mrs. Taylor.
School won't be out for 20 minutes.
I came early, and it appears it's a good thing I did.
Well, we were playing forest, and Amy resented being a toad.
Mrs. Burch?
You're not telling me that Amy's up in the tree with your mother again?
- No, ma'am.
She flew away.
- Thank you, Tabitha.
Mrs. Taylor, come out into the office and I'll explain everything.
Oh, that's kind of weird, Harve.
A butterfly way up here?
They got wings, don't they?
You got anything to trade for a liverwurst on wheat?
Get your hands out of there, you no-good Watch your language, Benny.
There's a lady present.
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.
Don't let me interrupt your lunch, gentlemen.
All right, Amy, you stay right there.
I think you've caused enough commotion for one day.
You be a good little butterfly.
There.
Aren't we having lovely weather?
You still haven't answered my question.
You got anything to trade for liverwurst?
Sure, sure.
I understand about playing forest.
I understand why you wanted to make my Amy a toad instead of a butterfly.
But the fact is that my child is still missing.
But I've never lost a child in all my years as a teacher.
- And you start by losing mine.
- Look, somehow I'll make it up to you.
I'm calling the police.
Tabitha.
Come here.
Hi, Mommy.
Is that Amy?
Yes.
Now, we haven't got much time.
Where's Mrs. Burch?
She's in the other room getting yelled at by Amy's mom.
All right, sweetheart.
Now, come on, Amy.
You change her back to regular, okay?
Okay, Mommy.
Hey, that was neat.
Amy, your mom's probably worried about you.
It can't be kidnapping, officer.
The lady is still here.
I'm telling you that my Amy!
Mama, I was a butterfly.
I flew out the window and got into a tree and flew onto a tall building.
Then Tabitha's mommy caught me in a net.
Well, at least you haven't subverted her creativity.
Come along, Amy.
Samantha, I knew you'd be here.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Burch.
I'm afraid Mrs. Burch has had a rather trying day.
- Shall we leave?
- I will say I'm a little confused myself.
- Here.
You left your coat in the shop.
- Yes, thank you.
I was in such a hurry.
Samantha, something's been bothering me.
- Really?
- Yes.
How did you get out of that dress shop without my seeing you?
Well, a determined, anxious mother can always find a way.
Come on.
Goodbye, Mrs. Burch.
Samantha.
Honey?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
- Sit down.
I'll fix you a drink.
- You mean I'll need one?
No.
Well, how did it go today?
Fine.
How did everything go with you?
Come on, Sam.
Tell me about Tabitha's nursery school.
Oh, well, it's a small building, and it I don't care about the building.
What happened?
Nothing.
Here's your drink.
- Nothing happened?
- Well, next to nothing.
Sam, may we delve a little more deeply into what "next to nothing" means?
Well, let me put it simply, sweetheart.
You don't have to worry about Tabitha in nursery school anymore.
- Why not?
- The school's closing.
- Did I put enough ice in that?
- Why is the school closing?
Mrs. Burch, Tabitha's teacher, she's taking a vacation.
After one day?
She wants to avoid a nervous breakdown.
I have the growing suspicion you should make this into a double.
Sure, sweetheart.
Exactly what would make a teacher so nervous?
Well, one of the children flew out the window.
You know how that can be.
No, I don't know how that can be, Sam.
Tell me how that can be.
Well she was accidentally turned into a butterfly.
Make it a triple.
But after she was turned into a butterfly it was simply a matter of getting Tabitha to change her back.
After I got her off the skyscraper.
Make it a quadruple, Sam.
And finish the story after I pass out.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
There you are, sweetheart.
Your favourite: Scrambled eggs and chicken livers.
That's what I like, wild shouts of approval.
For Preparing HAND-LETTERED Advertising DISPLAY HEADINGS - Tasty?
- Great, honey.
Best you ever made.
Don't mind me, sweetheart.
Just keep on reading.
I'd forgotten what you looked like.
I'm sorry, honey.
But I have a very important meeting on this Stewart presentation at noon today, so would you mind changing it back?
Come in, Mrs. Kravitz.
I have here a little petition signed by a few neighbours.
- Petition?
- Mrs. Stephens knew we filed it with the commissioner a week ago.
Talk about the population explosion.
"To the Commissioner of Public Streets and Highways.
We, the undersigned, do hereby petition for the immediate removal of the willow tree that stands on the property of Darrin and Samantha Stephens said tree being a menace to the community".
No one is going to cut down my tree.
It was my very own Mother's Day present from Darrin the day Tabitha was born.
Honey, I know how you feel.
I tell you what.
I'll chop it down and make it into a bookcase so we'll have it forever.
Just a little joke to break the tension.
The only reason I came over was to suggest that well, relationship-wise, with the neighbourhood it might be better if you did it voluntarily.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
They are not going to cut down my tree.
It can be saved.
Mr. Stephens?
Hi.
I'm your new neighbour.
I'm Elaine Hanson.
How do you do?
I'm Darrin Stephens.
Abner?
Darrin Stephens is talking to a strange woman.
So, what?
I'm listening to one.
Would you drive me into the city?
My car is being worked on, and I can pick it up this morning.
Certainly.
Hop right in.
From Tripoli to Timbuktu I beg, I plead, I beseech of you A moment longer do not stay Come to me, come to me Dr. Bombay All right, child.
Open your eyes, stick out your tongue.
No, don't.
It's rude.
Oh, thank heaven you're here, Dr. Bombay.
Heaven had nothing to do with it, you naughty witch.
Do you realise you've zapped me out of an ostrich race in Australia just as I was crossing the finishing line?
- I apologise.
- Doesn't really matter.
I was coming in last.
Now what's the emergency?
That is.
My mother did not send her boy to medical school to play wet nurse to a willow.
Well, at least it won't talk back to you.
Please, Dr. Bombay.
I tried a tree surgeon and he couldn't do anything and I even tried some of my own, you know and that didn't do any good.
Then I thought of the most brilliant scientific mind of the age.
- Thank you.
- But he died a year ago so I decided to call you.
That's hardly a diplomatic remark.
It was meant to be a challenge.
Then I accept it.
Abner?
Now Mrs. Stephens is talking to a strange man.
Why can't you get your nose out of that dumb book?
I want to see how it ends.
It's about the Civil War.
The North won.
Thank you, Gladys.
If I were a woodpecker, I'd picket your house.
Well, I suggest the merciful thing to do is to burn the tree in the nearest fireplace.
No.
I want it saved.
It was my very own Mother's Day present.
I can argue with anything but the illogical sentiment of women.
Let's have a go at it.
I've got to find out what's going on over there.
I know!
I'll take Mrs. Stephens some of my brownies.
Why?
What did she ever do to you?
Weeping willow, black with blight I command with all my might Let your sap run free and right And with every wayward breeze Which within your branches leap You will weep and weep and weep Water the patient daily keep the neighbourhood pets away from it and pray.
You know, I think it's looking better already.
Oh, Dr. Bombay.
I don't know how to thank you.
It really is looking better.
Or is it?
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I must be over wrought?
"And with every wayward breeze that within your branches leap you will weep and weep and weep".
Oh, good grief!
I must have gotten caught in the fallout.
Dr. Bombay, I think you've made a terrible mistake.
I brought you some brownies.
I know when I get upset, they act like tranquilizers.
Well, thank you very much, Mrs. Kravitz but I'm not upset.
Don't be brave.
A sick tree can take a lot out of a person.
By the way, who was that gentleman I saw you talking to outside?
That was no gentleman.
That was my tree doctor.
He's gonna save my willow.
I wish I had known.
My petunia plant is developing a fungus.
What a shame!
Look, Mrs. Stephens, I'm not the smartest person on the block but I can see you're very upset about something.
Well, actually I am upset about my tree.
Look, Mrs. Stephens, I wasn't born yesterday.
That's not tree crying.
That kind of crying only comes from a broken heart.
Is there something wrong between you and Mr. Stephens?
Of course not, Mrs. Kravitz.
Why, Darrin and I are a divinely happy couple.
Sure you are.
Well, I'll be running along now.
Bye!
Thanks for the brownies.
"And with every wayward breeze, you will weep and weep and weep".
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
You're a sweetheart.
Ciao.
"Fair and sunny all day with gusty winds up to 25 miles an hour".
You sure know how to hurt a witch.
From Tripoli to Timbuktu I beg, I plead, I beseech of you A moment longer do not stay Come to me, come to me Dr. Bombay It's terrific, Darrin.
Stewart will be wild about this stuff.
Thanks, Larry.
- Yes?
- Mr. Stephens?
A Mrs. Kravitz is calling.
Mrs. Kravitz?
Put her on.
Yes, Mrs. Kravitz?
I got only one word to say to you, you beast.
Don't do it.
Mrs. Kravitz, what are you talking about?
I am talking about a certain beautiful young brunette that you've been carrying on with.
Mrs. Kravitz, I can't talk to you now but everything at our house is beautiful.
That's why Mrs. Stephens is crying her poor eyes out, huh?
Mrs. Kravitz, I'm sure you're exaggerating.
If I'm exaggerating, may l Mrs. Kravitz, I can't talk to you now.
I've got to get back to work.
Good-bye.
Trouble at home?
Seems that Sam's all upset over that tree business I told you about.
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.
How is everything?
Oh, nothing.
Except maybe I'm getting a little cold.
See?
Sweetheart, are you crying?
No!
No, of course not.
Why would you say that?
You're all upset over your willow tree, aren't you?
- Yes, that's it.
- It's all right.
I'll get you another tree.
How about a beautiful magnolia?
Sam, I'm coming right home.
Sweetheart, don't do that.
Are you sure you'll be all right?
Yes.
Yes, I'm feeling much better.
Yes.
Well, then, okay but I'll see you soon, honey.
Bye.
You did something naughty, Darrin.
Larry, knock it off.
She's upset about our willow tree.
Sure.
Who is she?
Who is who?
Who is that cute little chick you drove up to the office with, that who.
That was our neighbour.
I just dropped her off.
You son of a gun.
The quiet ones are always the worst.
Who is she?
Larry, there are some things that are personal between a husband and wife.
Now let's just drop it.
Okay, it's dropped.
- It's serious, isn't it?
- Larry.
- You know how I know it's serious?
- How?
- You don't want to talk about it.
- Larry.
Darrin, have I ever poked my nose into your personal business?
- Yes.
- Right.
What's a best friend for?
A best friend is a guy who, when his best friend says, "butt out" he butts out.
Okay, until you come to your senses I resign as your best friend.
- Anything else?
- No.
Then I'll see you later, when Stewart gets here.
No, you won't.
Something came up, so I can't be with you on the Stewart presentation.
You'll have to handle it yourself.
From Pakistan to Waterloo I beg, I plead I beseech of you A moment longer do not stay Come to me, come to me Dr. Bombay From Pasadena, U.S.A. To old Red China across the bay A moment longer do not stay Come to me, come to me Dr. Bombay - From Little Rock to Liverpool - Nag, nag, nag.
Where have you been, Dr. Bombay?
- Didn't you hear me?
- Of course I heard you.
I was surfing in the finals at Makaha.
Came in second.
Would have won if I'd used a surfboard.
Well, what's the emergency this time?
Your crabgrass developing a case of the croup?
I'm the emergency.
Oh, dear.
You must have got caught in the fallout.
- That's what I thought.
- That's where I heard it.
Well, I never claimed to be a tree doctor.
Never mind the apologies.
Do something!
Why didn't I listen to father and become a psychiatrist?
Believe me, you meet a saner group of people.
Oh, Dr. Bombay?
Don't you think something a little tiny bit more appropriate?
That strange man is back, talking to Mrs. Stephens.
I wonder what it would cost to build an isolation booth in here?
Hark, ye wretched breezes blowing Cease Samantha's tears From flowing Dry her eyes, awak e or sleeping And let laughter Replace her weeping - Has rather a nice lilt, don't you think?
- It's swell.
Wait a minute.
There's someone coming to see me that shouldn't see you.
Will you go away?
But come back.
He disappeared.
Right before my eyes.
I'd give a fortune to find out how he did it.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
What brings you to the neighbourhood?
Curiosity.
Concern.
About what?
Now Mrs. Stephens is talking to Mr. Stephens's boss.
Now Mrs. Stephens is laughing.
Wanna get it off your chest, Sam?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Sam, I wasn't born yesterday.
I wasn't even born the day before yesterday.
When it comes to marital problems, I'm an old hand.
You know, Darrin was very upset after he talked to you on the phone.
Yeah, well, he was worried because I was upset about our willow tree.
Yes, that's what he told me, but I didn't believe him, and now that I hear you laughing a little too loud, I believe him even less.
Oh, you poor kid.
Stop trying to cover up.
I can tell your heart's broken.
Now come inside and let's see if we can patch it up.
Now they're going into the house together, and she's still laughing.
Don't you think it's peculiar?
First she's crying, then she's laughing and now she's going into the house with her husband's boss.
Don't interrupt him, Gladys.
His queen is in danger.
The marriage is in danger, Abner.
- Yes?
- It's Mrs. Kravitz again.
Get me an aspirin and put her on.
Yes, Mrs. Kravitz?
One word.
If you want to save your marriage, get home on the double.
- Yes?
- Mr. Stewart is here for your meeting.
Thank you.
Mr. Stewart.
Here's the presentation, Mr. Stewart.
I hope you like it.
Mr. Stephens.
Larry, I'm going to tell you once more.
I am laughing because I am relieved that my tree is better.
That tree looks pretty bad to me.
It looked worse yesterday.
Sam, Louise and I love you two.
Now, if there's anything we can Is it another woman?
Another man?
Sam, stop it.
Sam, you're breaking my heart.
Oh, hi, Darrin.
What's so funny?
What's so funny?
There's nothing funny.
There's nothing funny.
Her laugh's contagious.
I think she's flipped her lid.
What are you doing here?
Trying to patch things up, you rat.
Get down on your knees and beg her forgiveness.
Take care, Sam.
Abner, Mr. Stephens's boss is gone.
I saved a marriage.
Sam, you should have known better than to send for that quack.
I wouldn't let that witch doctor mow our lawn.
Well?
From Maine to California Dr. Bombay, I warn you I tried to find a little peace on the ocean floor and between your cackling and a glutinous shark You did it to her with one of your quacky spells.
Why?
Dear, boy, I cannot possibly give you a medical education in five minutes.
In layman's terms, I made a boo-boo.
How am I going to explain it to Larry?
Never mind about that.
Make her stop.
It does get on one's nerves.
Spirit wind, blow and billow Cure that sickly little willow Then remove the laugh from Sam And kindly tak e it on the lam And speaking of taking it on the lam Wait a minute.
I'm all right, but what about my tree?
In a matter of moments you will hardly recognise it.
This is the baby right here.
Forget the saw.
The axe will do it.
Don't you lay an axe on that tree.
Oh.
Sorry, lady, but that's a court order.
This is only from a municipal court.
We'll take it to the Supreme Court.
Lady, the tree is dead.
Not legally.
Not as long as there's an ounce of sap flowing through its trunk.
Lady, if there's an ounce of sap flowing through its trunk, I'll drink it.
Now stand back, please.
Lady.
Look!
Would you like your sap on the rocks, or with soda?
Charlie, did you see that?
No, I didn't see anything.
Let's get out of here.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Honey, I'd like some more coffee.
Sam?
Cute, huh?
Just Mother's weird sense of humour.
Good morning, slave.
Endora, you' re a one-woman invasion of privacy.
My daughter works like a slave.
I thought she might at least dress the part.
Mother, you've had your little joke, bad as it was so do you mind?
- Thank you.
- She never even knocks.
All of a sudden, she's here like the flu.
Watch it, dumbo.
Mother, dear I know it seems perfectly natural for you to arrive like this but I think, in the future, we deserve a little warning.
Like a hurricane or any other natural disaster.
Show us a little courtesy and consideration.
Courtesy?
Durwood, you could make a fortune giving rudeness lessons.
Mother.
I try to be polite, but it isn't easy with you around here.
But fortunately, I'm late for work.
Excuse me.
Mother, you bring out a side of Darrin that no one ever sees.
He's really very courteous and considerate even chivalrous and gallant.
Honey, I'm leaving.
Excuse me.
Courteous, chivalrous, gallant, is he?
Well, if he isn't now, he soon will be.
With a root of hemlock And a sting of bee I shall give him Instant courtesy Hi, Darrin.
Leaf of laurel, Pinch of salt Be considerate To a fault Root of hemlock, Stinger of bee Give him Super courtesy Politeness, manners, Gallantry Good morning, Frank.
How are you feeling this morning?
- Good morning, Darrin.
I'm fine.
- That's great.
You look fine.
- Let me help you, Betty.
- Oh, it's all right.
- Really.
- Right here.
No, no, I' II do that too.
There you go.
Oh, you wanted the Adrienne Sebastian file this morning.
Oh, that's too heavy for you, Betty.
Let me take it.
While I'm at it, let me get your typewriter out for you.
Thanks.
Let me compliment you on the way you' re doing your hair.
Why, thank you.
And that dress, just perfect on you.
Mr. Stephens, I think there's something you should know.
I'm engaged.
To be married.
Wonderful.
Who's the lucky fella?
Hope I'm not interrupting anything important.
Not at all, Larry.
Excuse us, Betty.
Please?
- After you.
- No, no, no.
Go ahead.
Please.
You' re very gallant.
Well Have you and Miss Wilson been lunching?
No.
I mean, before she got engaged.
Of course not.
It's those cool cats who fool you.
We have Adrienne Sebastian and her advertising manager in at 11:00.
And they don't go visiting unless it means business.
Big business.
I have two ways of approaching the account.
Well, let's make a good first impression.
Look for yourself.
Here's the poetry.
First I tried a rock-them-sock-them hard sell.
It didn't seem to work.
- They' II love it.
- Then I tried something more subtle No, no, no, no, stay with a hard sell.
It's their bag.
Well, then there it is.
Larry.
Have a chair.
You might wanna make some notes.
Comfortable?
What is going on around here?
I don't understand why you' re so suspicious.
What's bugging you?
What's bugging me is what's bugging you.
There's nothing bugging me.
You' re even laughing off-key.
Darrin, I've got radar.
I get a ping when something's wrong.
You may need a new tube in your pinger.
This is a good pitch.
I think I' II go to the privacy of my office and study it.
Nothing you wanna tell me?
No.
You don't want to talk about it.
Well, in case you do, I'm always here.
Yes?
Mrs. Sebastian and Mr. Traynor are here.
Oh, well, send them right in, and, Miss Springer, tell Mr. Stephens.
Oh, Mrs. Sebastian, this is a great honour.
- How do you do, Mr. Tate?
- Mr. Traynor, pleasure to see you.
- How are you?
- Been looking forward to this meeting.
You know, after all, Adrienne Sebastian is practically a household word.
It's one of the truly great cosmetic firms.
- May I join the festivities?
- Oh, come in, come in, Darrin.
Mrs. Sebastian, Mr. Traynor, may I present my associate Darrin Stephens.
Mrs. Sebastian, your own beauty is the best advertisement for your product.
You' re hired.
And, Mr. Traynor, great pleasure meeting you, sir.
All right, let's move this along, shall we?
Well, fine.
Darrin?
Let me seat Mrs. Sebastian first.
- Thank you.
- I think you' II find that comfortable.
The light won't be in your eyes.
You' re very thoughtful, Mr. Stephens.
- Cigar?
- Pitch the idea.
We' re pressed for time.
Rush, rush, rush.
That's why we have an ulcer-ridden society.
Darrin, you' re about to give me one.
I think Mr. Stephens has a very refreshing point of view.
Oh, so do I. I just don't want to inconvenience you with a delay.
Darrin?
We have two presentations.
One, the old hard sell.
The other emphasizes the grace the charm, the feminine mystique that I always associate with the name Adrienne Sebastian.
You' re selling a very intangible thing.
Beauty.
And our research tells us that people of today are really turned on by beautiful things.
So, what's beauty?
A flower, a Renoir painting a Chopin nocturne a sunrise with the surf coming up.
A sales chart with the line going up.
For heaven's sakes, Darrin, this is a business conference not a philosophy seminar.
- I rather like it.
- So do I. I want a campaign that says you've got two choices: Use Adrienne Sebastian products, or be ugly.
Oh, Charlie, that is pretty crass.
Yes.
Perhaps that is, shall we say, blunt?
It sells.
And I make the decisions.
- Right, Adrienne?
- Oh, yes.
When I think of it, perhaps sometimes the hard sell does hit the target.
So far we've had nothing but interruptions and detours.
You' re trying to cover up a lousy campaign.
Not at all.
Here, look at these.
I think you'd better call the office and tell them we' re going to be a little late.
I' II dial it while you look at the presentation.
- I'd rather do it myself.
- It'd be my pleasure.
Darrin, put down that phone.
Sorry.
My apologies, Mr. Traynor.
Could I speak to you for a moment while they go over the ideas?
Certainly, Larry.
Oh, excuse us.
Of course.
- After you.
- Go ahead.
No, please.
- Just what are you trying to do?
- Is something wrong?
Oh, you' re perspiring.
Stop that.
If you' re not blowing your mind, you' re sure blowing this meeting.
Larry, they' re our guests.
I'm just trying to be considerate.
You' re overdoing it.
Will you just pitch that presentation?
I think she digs the soft sell.
- But he makes the decisions.
- But it's her company.
I' II get the other presentation.
Oh, darn.
Here, I' II do that for you, Miss Springer.
I can do it, it's just that it's so I know, it's a messy man's job.
I'm not knocked out by this, but it is hard sell, and that's what we want.
I'm not sure, Charlie.
I think we should look at Mr. Stephens' second concept.
Well, maybe he can come up with a tough hard sell with warmth.
He has 10 seconds.
It bothers me seeing a pretty girl like you getting her fingers dirty.
Very sweet of you.
There's still a lot of chivalry left in the world today.
- Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
- I've got it right here, Larry.
Tate, I've got a gut feeling that you and Sir Walter Raleigh here haven't anything to interest us.
Charlie, Mr. Stephens was only showing common courtesy.
Courtesy is a refuge of scoundrels and yes men.
I've got a feeling he's both.
Adrienne, we' re running late.
I think you' re making a mistake, but it was a pleasure meeting you.
Both.
Now, that's a darn shame.
Losing several million in billing?
Yeah.
I guess you could call it that.
"A darn shame".
Unless you wanna call it a catastrophe.
Larry, you' re perspiring again.
Here, let me Will you knock off this do-gooder routine?
Flitting around the office like the good fairy.
Did it ever occur to you that people want to dial their own phones?
Even if it's just to give their fingers a little exercise.
I was merely treating our guests as courteously and as politely as I know how.
And I've had all I can take of this courtesy bunk!
- Darrin, you've been working too hard.
- You too, Larry.
I want you to take a vacation, get a little rest.
That's very considerate, but I don't No, no, no, no, no, I insist.
Go away somewhere.
See the Caribbean.
See the islands.
- See a doctor.
- A doctor?
To help straighten out your thinking, unkink you.
- Wait - It happens in the advertising business.
And, believe me, I understand.
I know the pressures, the tensions, the frustrations and then: So take a year, two years, three, if you need it.
That's the most generous thing I've ever heard.
Darrin, I didn't mean a vacation with pay.
When your batteries are recharged, and you' re back in your old form come and see me, and we' II talk things over.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, darling.
What are you doing home so early?
I'm trying to figure that out myself.
Oh, hey.
Those are too heavy for you.
Let me do that.
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
- How'd the meeting go?
- Right out the window.
I never realised all the work you do here while I'm at the office.
Wait, wait a minute.
What do you mean, "right out the window"?
Honey, I wouldn't worry you for the world, but Would you sit down for a second?
Would you like something?
A cup of coffee.
A cold drink.
Yes, I'd like something.
To know what's going on.
I know it's not polite to be this blunt, but You think I'm having a nervous breakdown?
Exactly what went wrong today?
Precisely.
Frankly, Larry was acting a little odd today.
He seemed to have this phobia about simple, ordinary, everyday courtesy.
Now, what's wrong with the world today?
Nobody seems to appreciate the niceties, the gallantry.
Courtesies.
Don't you worry, I'm sure Larry's over it by now.
You know how he is.
Now, you just relax.
I have some things to do in the kitchen.
May I help you?
No, please don't, as a favour to me.
Well, since you put it that way.
Thank you.
Mother.
Mother, you come here this minute.
"Tell your chivalrous husband that his courteous mother-in-law is regrettably unavailable".
Oh, Mother, you are exasperating.
"Guess who made me that way".
Larry, I think you' re acting like a fool.
Darrin is your friend.
Not anymore.
I fired him.
Oh, you are really beautiful.
Louise, he was acting very strangely.
By your standards, anyone who offers you a light or insists that you go out the door first is having a nervous breakdown.
Right.
Mrs. Sebastian.
How nice to see you again.
Thank you.
May I come in?
Please do.
This is a very pleasant surprise.
I can only stay a moment, but I did want to talk to you even though I shouldn't go over Mr. Traynor's head.
You see, I was very impressed with you, Mr. Stephens.
Our advertising needs a fresh, new look.
We also need a new advertising agency.
How does this sound?
The Darrin Stephens Agency.
You can start with my account, and if I do say so that's a very good start.
- Well, you' re very flattering.
- It's just good business for me.
I don't want to press you for a decision.
I have a package to pick up, and I can stop by on my way home.
Maybe we' II have something to celebrate.
May I walk you to your car?
Well, here goes.
The good witch against the bad witch.
Larry Tate, play it wise Admit you're wrong, apologise I merely got rid of a disloyal employee.
And one of the most creative men I know, who is also a trusted friend.
Why did I say that?
- I' II phone him.
- Not by phone, Larry Tate Come yourself, don't hesitate I think I'd better go right over and see him.
Mother, where have you been?
Samantha, surely you haven't forgotten that it does take a few minutes to get here from Bangkok especially during the monsoon season.
You put a courtesy spell on Darrin, didn't you?
- Who?
- Darrin, my husband?
Oh, yes, him.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling, but he's one of the most forgettable people I know.
Well, never mind that.
Just take it off him.
All right, all right.
The whole thing is getting boring anyway.
Disappear, courtesy That's a counter-spell?
Well, what do you expect on such short notice?
Poetry?
Ta, ta, dear.
Oh, Mother, you' re a naughty witch.
Hello, Samantha.
Darrin.
- Surprised to see me?
- Not really.
Come in.
Well, I've been doing a lot of soul-searching and I realise how wrong I was.
That's very considerate.
- Isn't it, sweetheart?
- For Larry, yes.
Darrin, I said a lot of things I shouldn't have.
I was upset.
You were a little weird.
In any case, Darrin, old friend, forgive me.
I apologise.
In case you weren't listening, Larry just apologised.
- I heard him.
- Darrin.
I'm just wondering how sincere the apology is.
Darrin, I'm surprised at you.
He found out that Adrienne Sebastian offered me the account personally.
- How can you think such a thing?
- I learned from the maestro.
Wait a minute.
You mean she offered you the account?
Hey, what an opportunity for both of us.
Marvellous.
Congratulations, Darrin.
- You didn't know anything about this?
- Of course not.
My word of honour.
My real word of honour.
Well, Larry, forgive me.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
We have more arrivals and departures than Kennedy International.
Oh, Mrs. Sebastian.
I'm Samantha Stephens.
Won't you come in?
Thank you, l Why, Mr. Tate, I didn't expect to see you here.
I realised I'd fired the most talented man on my staff and I came over to beg his forgiveness.
Rubbish.
You men are all alike.
I don't believe you really fired him.
I think it was just a clever gimmick to get my account.
Mrs. Sebastian, that doesn't make any sense.
I don't have to make sense.
Maybe I'm just a silly female, but I trust my intuition and something is wrong here.
I'm cancelling my offer.
Well, that's your prerogative.
However, here's the alternate concept.
It's yours, no strings.
What Darrin has in mind is that Never mind.
Thank you, no.
I am not interested.
I think l I think I'd be foolish to refuse.
Why did I say that?
Well, it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind.
- Stephens and Tate ride again.
- Yeah, Tate and Stephens ride again.
- Let's open up a bottle of bubbly.
- I' II drink to that.
It's funny the way things have of working themselves out.
Funny?
Yeah, it's hilarious.
Oh, boy.
Well, that's the end of the bottle, Darrin.
But there' II never be an end to our friendship.
Never.
Accounts may come and accounts may go but true friendship goes on forever.
I think I have the cello part for this somewhere.
Hello.
Oh, Mrs. Sebastian.
Well, thank you very much.
We would be delighted.
Thank you.
How about that?
She loved the second concept.
She thought the ideas were inventive, fresh, and we've got the account.
I knew she'd like it.
- Larry, you never even saw it.
- Don't quibble about the details.
I'm going home and celebrate all over again with Louise.
Louise.
Be in my office at 9:00.
And fill me in on what that's all about.
Night, Samuel.
Well, what do you know?
- And we owe it all to Mother.
- And we owe it all to Oh, what?
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
- You see, sweetheart, she said - I don't wanna hear about it.
- Well, Darrin, she just thought that if - Sam, don't tell me.
You won't mind if I tell her?
What do you mean?
When she hears that she actually helped you she won't sleep for a week.
I' II build it up a little.
She won't sleep for a month.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Are you gonna tell me what you' re doing, or do I have to guess?
I'm making a paper airplane for Tabitha.
- Haven't you ever seen one before?
- No.
Will it fly?
Of course.
Come on.
I' II show you.
Tabitha?
I once won a paper airplane contest.
Oh, isn't that nice.
Watch this, Tabitha.
Hey, that's cute.
I want to try it, Daddy.
You just throw it the way Daddy did.
No, no.
Like this, sweetheart.
- Hello?
- Hi, Samantha.
It's Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Stephens.
How are you?
Oh, fine, dear.
It's such a lovely day I thought I'd invite myself over for a visit.
Oh, gee, Mrs. Stephens.
I'm sorry to disappoint you but Darrin's going to play golf, and I'm Oh, that's perfect.
It' II give us girls a chance for a little talk-talk.
A little talk-talk?
Oh, I'd just love that.
Oh, good, dear.
I' II be over right after lunch.
Bye.
- Who was that?
- Your mother.
It's such a lovely day, she's coming over to nose around.
I'm sure she won't stay long.
Last Sunday, she came for lunch and left after dinner.
Oh.
Well, maybe I should give up my golf game.
Oh, no, sweetheart.
You don't have to do that.
I don't mind.
After all, she's my mother.
- Well, it would be nice.
- You bet.
And next Sunday, if she comes over, I won't play golf.
Terrific.
Hey, that's very good.
- It's fun flying Daddy's plane, isn't it?
- I'm gonna fly it all day.
Can I try?
Obviously, this just isn't my day.
Good afternoon, darling.
Hi.
Now that isn't what I'd call an enthusiastic greeting.
Well, it's just that you startled me.
- Where have you been?
- Persia, darling.
The Shah of Xanadu was becoming drearily insistent so I decided to teach him a lesson and disappear.
But I'm really hooked on his hookah.
He's probably tearing the palace inside out looking for it.
Mother, would you mind changing?
Why, darling?
Well, I'm expecting Darrin's mother any minute.
And hide your hookah.
Oh, you poor thing.
Darling, why don't you come to the palace with me.
The shah isn't that dreary.
Mother, please?
- Thank you.
Yes.
- All right?
I'm sorry to be late, Samantha.
Is my adorable granddaughter up from her nap yet?
No, not for a while.
You remember my mother.
Oh, yes.
How terribly nice to see you.
Do you live here now?
Live here?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Well, it's just that every time I visit, she's here.
Oh, it's just a coincidence.
A happy coincidence.
Samantha darling, I'm sure you and Mrs Stephens have so many things to talk about.
I think I' II be going.
Oh, what a shame.
Here, let me take your coat.
Where Where did she go?
Well, when my mother says she's going she goes.
But But just Why are we standing here?
Let's go in and sit down.
Come on.
Actually, I'm glad we have this chance to talk because I've been thinking.
And what I've been thinking is that you need a maid.
- A maid?
What for?
- Well, it' II give you time to socialize with the people who can boost Darrin up the ladder of success.
What people are those?
Well, for instance, there's Mrs. Endicott Otis.
Her husband practically runs the community and I would never have met her if I didn't sacrifice those two days a week at the League of Women Volunteers.
Well, I feel that I make my fair contribution to charity and still have time to take care of our home.
That must explain why you look so tired and drawn.
Tired and drawn?
Samantha, I'm going to arrange for you to meet Mrs. Otis.
Now, it wouldn't do for her to think Darrin couldn't afford a maid, would it?
Mrs. Stephens, I don't know why I've been fighting you.
We definitely need a maid.
Definitely.
I' II start to work on it next week.
Now that your decision's made, why wait?
After we talked this morning, I phoned the employment agency and asked them to send over a few prospects this afternoon.
- You' re kidding.
- I knew you'd be pleased.
Oh, that must be the first applicant.
Now the most important thing about hiring anybody is to establish immediately who is working for whom.
And make it clear that the job is no snap.
She will cook, clean, do the laundry and the ironing and help take care of Tabitha.
She' II have Thursdays off and every other Sunday afternoon.
I' II be in the kitchen.
I don't want to interfere.
Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- I'm from the employment agency.
- Are you Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes.
First First, I want to make it clear that this job is no snap.
You' II have to do the cooking and the cleaning and Well, now, there are a few more things we ought to discuss.
That's right.
I have to have every weekend and Wednesday afternoon off.
I can't possibly get breakfast ready before 9:00 and I' II serve dinner no later than 7:00.
Of course you have an automatic dishwasher, garbage disposal washing machine.
- Oh, yes.
- All right.
I' II take the job.
- Thank you.
By the way, what is your name?
- Mrs. Harper.
- What shall I call you?
Mrs. Harper.
I' II take a look upstairs to see what I've gotten into.
I wish you wouldn't go upstairs.
The baby's still - A baby!
- Well, she isn't very big.
She's only Mrs. Stephens, you have flunked this interview.
Good.
I think.
How did you do?
I bombed out.
- Oh, here we go again.
- I' II stay this time.
Maybe I can help.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes.
- I'm Amelia.
The agency sent me.
They said you were looking for a full-time, live-in maid.
I just love being a full-time, live-in maid.
I find it very rewarding.
Well, you may be just the one we' re looking for.
- Come in.
- Thank you.
My, what a lovely home you have.
Well, we like it.
This is Amelia.
Amelia, this is my mother-in-law, Mrs. Stephens.
- Hello, Amelia.
- How do you do?
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.
My, this is a comfortable chair.
Amelia, I'm going to be honest with you.
There are a few disadvantages to this job.
Mrs. Stephens, my philosophy has always been that nothing is ideal, nobody is perfect there are flies in the best of ointments.
Those are the little crosses that one learns to bear.
That's a perfectly marvellous philosophy, Amelia.
Don't you agree, Samantha?
Well, yes, of course.
But to get back to the disadvantages.
There's a four-year-old child.
She's very lively.
You no sooner straighten up after her, then she's in to something else again.
That's children for you, bless them.
Mrs. Stephens, would you mind getting us some more cookies?
Of course.
What happened to the cookies that were Good cookies go fast.
Oh, yes.
Well, I'm delighted to help in any way a mother-in-law can.
Another problem we have is the irregularity of our meals.
You see, my husband is in advertising.
We entertain a lot and keep peculiar hours.
Often you'd be asked to fix dinner for 12, in less than an hour's notice.
Mrs. Stephens, you need say no more.
Oh, well, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
Oh, but it will work out beautifully.
Your household is the kind of challenge I find very rewarding.
- It is?
- My things are out in the car.
I can start taking care of you and your little family right away.
You and I are going to have lots of rewarding times together.
Do you want to see my airplane fly?
Oh, yes, indeed I do.
Good gracious.
That's incredible.
I've never seen anything like that in all my days.
My husband made it.
He won a paper airplane contest when he was a little boy.
He was 23.
And that plane couldn't fly anything like this one.
Gracious.
I'd better get dinner started.
I' II show Amelia around the kitchen while you' re dressing Tabitha.
It's so rewarding to have such a helpful mother-in-law.
You have no idea.
I know it's been a lot of work, Amelia but it's my son's favourite meal.
Did you know that, Samantha?
Yes, Mrs. Stephens.
I believe you've mentioned it once or twice.
- Where's Tabitha?
- She's playing out back.
I' II set the table.
Have you mastered hollandaise sauce yet, Samantha?
I'm afraid not.
That recipe you gave me always seems to curdle.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
Darrin.
I had no idea it was so late.
I must be off, dear.
I wouldn't want to horn in on Sam's little surprise.
- What surprise?
- Oh, you' II see.
Bye, dear.
Goodbye, dear.
I' II let myself out.
What surprise?
Well, it's really your mother's surprise.
And it's not little.
It weighs about 140 pounds.
- What does?
- Our new maid.
New maid How come we have a maid?
Because your mother can be very persuasive.
- But, honey, you know - Come on.
You know we can't have a maid with all the hocus-pocus that goes on.
I know.
I' II tell her first thing in the morning that things didn't work out.
How about telling her tonight?
Well, all right.
We' II tell her first thing after dinner.
We' II make up some excuse to let her go give her a good recommendation, two weeks' salary and a fond farewell.
How about one week's salary and two fond farewells?
This baked Alaska is delicious.
How about that asparagus with hollandaise?
And how about that shepherd's pie?
And I was gonna give you plain old hamburger.
Well.
Well, what?
You better go in and fire Amelia.
Me?
You fire her.
That's your job.
Darrin, your mother got us into it.
It's up to you to get us out of it.
I wish I could find an argument for that.
Be gentle.
Amelia, may I have a word with you?
Of course, Mr. Stephens.
We haven't had much of a chance for a chat.
You' re a very lucky man, Mr. Stephens.
Tabitha is the most adorable child I've ever seen.
Pretty and unspoiled.
And if you don't mind my saying so she looks quite a bit like her father.
- Thank you.
And your wife, she's just as sweet as she can be.
- Thank you.
- And I can't thank you enough for making it possible for me to be part of this happy home.
- Thank you.
- Oh, but I'm keeping you from whatever it was you wanted to speak to me about.
- It's just that - Yes, sir?
The dinner was delicious, Amelia.
Well?
I can't do it.
She loves it here.
I' II see what I can do.
Be gentle.
Be it ever so humble There's no place lik e home Well?
Now she's singing "Home, Sweet Home".
Sam, there's only one thing to do.
First thing tomorrow morning, we' II fire her.
After I leave for the office.
Now.
Now then, what problem has that brute saddled you with?
Through no fault of Darrin's, we have a maid.
Whatever for?
Oh, to do the housework, and cook the meals, and things like that.
Samantha, you mean to say that you' re paying someone to do what you could do with a snap of your fingers?
Oh, how utterly, utterly, mortal.
It was Mrs. Stephens's idea.
Oh, so Durwood's mommy wanted you to have a maid.
Oh, how sweet.
Mother, you' re not helping.
What I have to do is find a way to get rid of her.
Oh, Samantha, you've been living this humdrum life too long.
Simply turn the creature into a toad, and put her out back.
Mother, I would like a constructive suggestion.
How about a destructive one?
What did you have in mind?
This: One look at this shambles and that will be the end of your maid.
Mother, you' re a genius.
A bit overdone, perhaps, but a genius.
Well, if you think that shows talent wait till you see the kitchen.
Oh, I' II take your word for it.
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.
I don't want to be around when Amelia gets home.
Good gracious!
Oh, Leslie, I just know you' re going to adore Samantha.
- We' II see.
- Charming little cottage, isn't it?
Charming.
Good gracious.
I've certainly got my day's work cut out for me.
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Stephens.
Good morning, Amelia.
Is - What happened?
- I don't know, ma'am.
I'm sure there's a good explanation.
I'm sure.
Amelia, I'm terribly sorry about the mess.
Mother and Tabitha were playing.
They play rough.
They fooled around a little in the kitchen too.
I noticed.
I think I'd better get started in there.
But don't you worry about a thing, Mrs. Stephens.
I believe in children having free expression.
Well, Mrs. Stephens.
Samantha, this is Leslie Otis.
How do you do?
You' II have to excuse the house.
Must have been quite a party.
Oh, well, we don't do that kind of thing very often.
It's just that our maid gets nervous if there's not a lot to do.
You mean you have a maid who doesn't complain about things like this?
Oh, no, not at all.
She just loves rewarding challenges.
Well, if you have a maid who feels that this is a rewarding challenge she's worth a king's ransom.
Of course, it wouldn't do to tell her that.
I don't suppose she has a twin.
No.
No, no, Amelia is one of a kind.
She' II have this place cleaned up in no time.
So I insist that the two of you stay for lunch.
She's an excellent cook, along with all of her other talents.
Oh, I don't think we ought to trouble you at this time It's no trouble at all.
Now, come on.
You just make yourselves at home in the den and I' II talk to Amelia about lunch.
If I believe what's happening, I must be getting senile.
Perhaps, on the other hand, I'm getting younger and a little more lively.
Amelia l'd like to speak to you about lunch for three.
- Are you all right, Amelia?
- No.
Yes.
I always say, when things are going well, don't ask questions.
I always say that too.
Now about lunch Excuse me.
Before we get into that, may I say something?
Of course, Amelia.
You just speak up and tell me whatever's on your mind.
Mrs. Stephens, I've never been as happy in my entire career as a maid and I'm looking forward to a long perhaps even permanent, relationship with you and your little family.
Oh, my.
That is splendid news.
Amelia, that was a perfectly delicious luncheon.
Thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
I just can't believe what you were able to accomplish in less than half an hour.
Well, I just simply can't believe it.
There's something very inspiring about working here.
Well, thank you, Amelia.
We' II have our coffee in the living room.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Shall we?
Pardon me.
Is that the way I go to powder my nose?
Yes.
Into the den and to your left.
- Oh, if you' II excuse me.
- Certainly.
Mrs. Otis.
Amelia, I'm not one for beating about the bush.
How would you like to come to work for Mrs. Endicott Otis?
Leslie likes you, Samantha.
I'm perceptive about those things.
Oh, that's nice.
Oh, I forgot to speak to Amelia about the roast for dinner.
I' II be right back.
Whatever Mrs. Stephens is paying you, I' II pay you half again as much.
Thank you, Mrs. Otis, but I find working at the Stephens's very rewarding.
What about the prestige of working for us?
- You'd be queen of the supermarket.
- You' re very kind, Mrs. Otis but I wouldn't find prestige as rewarding as my life here.
Well, certainly you could use the extra money.
Yes, I am sending my nephew through college.
Would you find double your present salary more rewarding?
Oh, Mrs. Otis, I don't see how I can.
How I can possibly turn down such a generous offer.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
- Serena!
- I might've known.
Who were you expecting, Steve McQueen?
What is the big idea?
I just came by to ask you to take a ride on my new bike.
Isn't it the end?
No, but you are.
Do you realize it's 3:00 in the morning?
Sure, that's the ideal time to go out on the road and open her up.
It's also the ideal time to sleep.
Well, if you're going to get huffy about it Nice seeing you, Serena.
Sorry you have to rush off.
- Who said I was leaving?
- Who said you were staying?
Cousin, you're not being very gracious.
Compared to the way I feel, she is!
Just for that, I'm going to stay for breakfast, lunch and dinner dull as that will be.
- Oh, no, you won't!
Sweetheart, why don't you go back to bed and let me?
No, let me.
It just so happens we're having a dinner party tonight for a very important client, and our plans don't include you.
You'd be bored to tears.
I can always provide my own entertainment, you know.
I know.
That's why you're not invited.
- Not that you're not welcome.
- Good night, Serena.
- See you around.
- Yeah!
Around dinnertime, that is.
Wait a minute!
Well, guess who's coming to dinner.
- Meet with your approval?
- Very nice, Sam.
No sign of Serena yet.
Let's keep our fingers crossed.
Maybe she'll forget about it.
Yeah, and maybe Macy's will tell Gimbel's.
- That the good china?
- It's the only china.
Oh, yes, of course.
The flowers look nice, Sam.
They're daisies.
Didn't they have roses?
Darrin, you're acting as if the queen of England is coming for dinner.
Believe me, the queen of England is a lot more democratic than Clio Vanita, and not as rich.
You've heard of the Seven Hills of Rome?
She owns three of them.
Well, I guess it pays to be a little old winemaker.
"Vino Vanita, the true gold of Rome".
Hey, that's a good slogan.
Is it yours?
Yeah, and I hope Clio agrees with you.
She's tough to please.
They're here!
Did you fill the ice bucket?
What about the canapés?
- Darrin, will you please relax?
- Come on, come on.
Oh, my.
Smile.
- Hi, kids.
I hope we're not late.
- Hi, Samantha, Darrin.
- Samantha, may I present Clio Vanita.
- Darling.
Naughty boy.
Did you not promise to take me to lunch, eh?
- And yet you never called.
- Well, l And this is the dear little wife of whom you've spoken.
Charming.
Charming.
May I take your coat?
My, what beautiful chinchilla.
Yes, but it is becoming so popular, I think I must give it away.
It's a shame you can't give it back to the chinchillas.
What a dear little house.
You must show it to me, caro mio.
- Well, she certainly has style.
- Oh, is that what you call it?
That's what I call it in mixed company.
I love what you have done to your house.
It is so intima, cosy, so incantev ole, enchanting.
Well, we find it comoda, comfortable.
Hey!
What does a guy have to do to get a drink around here?
Sorry.
What'll you have?
The usual?
That's right.
Vino Vanita, my favourite.
How about you, Louise?
- Oh, I'll have a - She'll have the same, won't you, dear?
- Clio?
- For me, a martini, very dry.
And when you stir it, don't use a spoon.
The metal spoils the taste.
Just use your so-charming little finger.
Say, isn't that interesting?
On second thought, I think I'll try a martini without a spoon.
- Me too.
- Excuse me.
- I'll be right back.
- I'll help you, sweetheart.
Won't you sit down?
Wow, she's gotta be kidding.
Now, honey, just keep remembering, we need her goodwill.
What a snob.
"When you stir my martini, use only your so-charming little finger".
Personally, I think she should see a plastic surgeon.
What for?
To have her nose lowered.
I don't know whether I've told you this, but I get more personal satisfaction out of working on the Vino Vanita account than any of the others.
I mentioned it to my wife just the other day.
- Isn't that right, dear?
- Oh, yes, we serve it all the time.
Speaking of that, you old, grey fox what have you been doing to earn all the money I pay you?
Clio, I don't know where to begin.
You did receive the copy on the 12 ads we're running in Connoisseur magazine?
Last month.
And what about that slogan you promised me, eh?
The one you said that would capture the imagination and sweep the country.
We've got a little surprise for you.
We've come up with a beaut.
Really?
What is it?
I'd rather let Darrin spring it Tell you about it.
At least we have one thing to be thankful for.
Serena hasn't shown up.
I don't know why you're so worried about her.
Compared to that Italian vulture, Serena's Chicken Delight.
Sweetheart, you take the drinks out.
I wanna check the squab.
- But don't you?
- No, no.
Now, hurry, hurry.
- Our guests must be dying of thirst.
- All right, all right.
Well, I'm glad to know I'm not late for dinner.
Serena, you know how fond I am of you But?
Well, it's just that it's a very complicated evening.
You're perfectly welcome to stay, as long as you keep out of sight.
Gee, I didn't know you were that fond of me.
Go ahead, tell her the slogan we came up with.
Now?
Wouldn't it be more appropriate after a drink or two?
Why mix drinking and pleasure?
I mean Don't be so modest, carissimo.
I insist on hearing it.
Okay.
Picture a scene, something like this one: Men and women, well-groomed, beautiful.
They lift their glasses in a toast and they say, "Vino Vanita the true gold of Rome".
Well, so much for our number two choice.
Now give her number one.
That one's not quite ready yet, Larry.
But he'll come up with it, and it'll be a lulu.
You don't have to sell me on this charming man.
He's an absolute genius, I know.
And someday I'm going to steal him from your organization.
If you don't watch out, cousin she's going to steal him from your organization.
That's ridiculous.
I think.
Rio de Janeiro was meraviglioso, marvellous.
Molto divertente, diverting, especially the Brazilian men.
Oh, I'm surprised to hear you say that.
Everyone says the Italian men are so attractive.
- To this I say ridicolo, ridiculous.
- Me too.
To me, the most charming, the most handsome are your American men.
Well, that may be, but Just remember, they're our American men.
Just a little joke.
An American joke.
It loses something in the translation.
Yes.
Would anyone care for some more dessert?
Signorina, you haven't even touched yours.
I do not dare.
Always I must watch my weight.
Is that right?
You know, personally, I think you have a terrific figure.
For a woman your age.
Naturally, what I meant was no one would ever dream that you had a problem with weight.
Terrible.
You do not know how lucky you are.
You do not have to fight the calories.
Oh, I pretty much eat what I want.
That is right.
When you are married, you can let yourself go to pieces, no?
I say, let's adjourn to the living room.
I am dying to see that funny little house you have in the garden.
- Will you show it to me?
- The gazebo?
Well, sure.
You don't mind if I borrow your husband for a while?
Of course not.
As long as you remember where you got the loan.
Your wife has quite a sense of humour, hasn't she?
Oh, yes.
That's what keeps me going.
We'll be laughing all the way to the bankruptcy.
- May I help you, Samantha?
- No, no, Louise.
You go keep Larry company.
I'll be in in a minute.
All right.
Serena, one of these days, you're gonna go too far and I hope you stay there.
Well, someone had to uphold the family honour.
And if I were you, I'd pop out to the patio and keep an eye on Madame Flutterby.
Serena, can't you understand?
She's no threat to me, but you're another matter.
It reminds me so much of my own garden on my estate just outside of Napoli.
- That's nice.
You know, it is surrounded by a gigantic forest.
They say it is populated by fate what you call elves.
Now, don't tell me a sophisticated woman like you believes in elves.
Well, fate is so similar to our word for fate.
Surely you believe in that, huh?
Fate?
Oh, yes.
That's what I'm worried about right now, my fate.
Clio, please.
Somebody might come out here like my wife.
Your wife.
I admire so much the loyalty in the male.
Clio, cut it out.
You Americani are so provinciale, provincial.
Or is it that you do not find me attractive?
Oh, no.
I find you very "attractivo"Attractive.
Well, then Please.
I'm beginning to think you do not want my account any longer.
Maybe I should look for another agenzia, eh?
Clio, don't be silly.
We love your account.
How much do you love it?
Then show it.
- How?
- Come to Rome with me.
What for?
Don't answer that.
Well, you know, we could visit the Vanita vineyards and it would inspire you to write the correct slogan, no?
Now, wait a minute, Clio.
Be sensible.
I don't have to go to Rome to think up a good slogan.
Apparently you do.
Okay, so you didn't care for what I came up with.
I can come up with another.
Then you'd better come up with it by domani, tomorrow because I have just decided, after the meeting, I am leaving.
If you think you can find a suitable slogan, bene, okay.
If not, you can say arrivederci to my account.
- What?
- Or you can come back to Rome with me.
Now, what do you say?
Clio, I have something to tell you.
I am very much in love with my wife, and my wife is in love with me.
- How nice.
Kiss me.
- I'll be right back.
I think I need another glass of Vanita wine.
I'll come with you, caro.
Oh, no, you don't.
No one is going to make a monkey out of my cousin.
In fact, I think my cousin's cousin is going to make a monkey out of you.
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.
- I want off the Vanita account.
- Why?
That woman is something else.
She wants me to go to Rome with her.
- No!
- Yes!
You lucky dog.
She says if I come up with a slogan she likes before she leaves, okay.
If not, either I go with her, or we lose the account.
Did you ever hear of such high-handed tactics?
Never.
Is your passport in good order?
- Larry, I'm not going to Rome!
- Let me put it this way: If we get knocked out of the ball game, you're benched, permanently.
Larry, that's pretty narrow-minded.
If you Oh, hi, Sam.
Louise is checking with the babysitter to see if she can stay later.
- Good.
- Fine.
- Anything wrong?
- Oh, no, no, no.
Larry and I were just discussing baseball.
I was just observing how short-lived a player's life can be.
- Where's Miss Vanita?
- Oh, I left her on the patio.
Alone?
Darrin, where are your manners?
Excuse me.
Serena, what are you doing out here?
Good deeds for you, coz.
Look, Larry, maybe I can come up with a slogan that'll make her happy by the time we meet tomorrow.
You'd better, or it's arrivederci, America, hello, Roma.
- Where's Miss Vanita?
- Right up there.
What?
Serena, you didn't!
You did!
Serena, you change her back right now.
Before you flip your gourd, coz, let me tell you what she did.
Are you out of your mind?
I don't care what she did.
You change her back.
You mean, you don't care if she takes Darrin to Rome?
Serena, I am going to count to three, and then l Rome?
Sam?
Honey?
Serena.
Sam, Larry and Louise wanna Hey.
Where did this come from?
Must've climbed over the wall, I guess.
Probably belongs to a neighbour.
Hey.
It sure is an affectionate little thing, isn't he?
She.
Darrin, there's something I have to tell you.
Can it wait?
Larry and Louise have to go.
Well, yeah.
What I wanna tell you is We're ready to go.
Have you seen Clio?
Well, she had a terrible headache, and so I told her to lie down in the den.
- Darrin'll drive her home.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- Where did you get the monkey?
- She must've come over the fence.
I'll take her.
Kind of vicious, isn't it?
- Good boy.
- What are you talking about?
That headache routine.
Very clever.
When you take her home, you can mend your bridges, right?
- Larry - I knew you wouldn't let me down.
- Well, good night, Samantha.
- Good night, Louise.
And tell Clio we're sorry about her headache.
- We'll see ourselves out.
- Night, Larry.
Night.
When did Clio go into the den?
I didn't see her.
Well, to tell you the truth, Darrin she kind of left.
I'm not surprised.
She was a little upset.
I guess I said something to offend her.
It sounds like he's trying to tell us something.
She.
Sweetheart, I think you ought to tie her up on the patio until morning.
Okay.
Come on there, you cute little thing.
We'll make you comfortable outside.
First thing tomorrow, we'll find out who you belong to.
Come on.
- Is that cute?
- I'd put it another way.
Okay, out!
Sam, you'll hurt her feelings.
If she doesn't get out of there right now l'll hurt more than her feelings.
I'm surprised at you.
Now, come on.
Come on.
Upsy-daisy.
There.
You see?
You just have to know how to talk to her.
Maybe we ought to let her stay right here.
Nothing doing.
I mean, she'll just keep chattering all night.
Eventually she'll settle down and go to sleep.
No, she won't.
- It'll calm her down.
- It'll keep me awake.
Don't be silly.
As a matter of fact, I can make a nice little bed for her right here in one of these drawers.
Don't you dare.
I don't want her in this room.
I don't even want her in this house.
- So, please, get her out of here.
- What is the matter with you?
I've never heard you carry on like this.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Where did that monkey come from?
- You invited her.
- What?
Darrin.
- That's not a monkey.
- It's not?
No.
That lovable little creature is Miss Vanita.
- You're joking.
- No.
You took a live client and turned her into a monkey?
- No.
- You are joking?
- No.
You're trying to drive me out of my mind?
I mean that that is Miss Vanita, but I didn't do it.
Serena did it.
You see, she thought Clio was in her own words, making a monkey out of me.
So she decided to make a monkey out of her.
You must admit, it does show imagination.
Sam!
That little minx.
When I get my hands on her, I'll You'll what?
Change her back, and then get out of my life forever!
- Darrin.
- Did you hear me?
I heard the last part and I'll be happy to cooperate.
See you around, coz.
Darrin, forgive me, but that was a dumb thing to say.
What did I say?
Serena, come back.
It's no use.
You insulted her.
You told her to stay out of your life.
But I was only joking, in a way.
The way you were joking, I'm afraid she took you seriously.
And she's the only one who can change Miss Vanita back.
Serena, after all these years this is no time to start taking me seriously!
I've sent emergency calls out everywhere.
No response.
Serena's just being stubborn.
Sam, what are we going to do?
That monkey has to be at a meeting at 11:00 tomorrow.
Well, I know what I'm going to do.
I'm going to bed.
And if you were smart, you'd do the same thing.
Go to bed?
And sleep?
How?
How do I do that with this monkey on my mind?
Better than having a monkey on your back.
We'll just have to wait until Serena cools off if she ever does.
Let's just hope she comes back someday.
Someday?
If I don't bring her a suitable slogan by 11:00 tomorrow we're going to get fired off this account.
Darrin, that's silly.
How can a monkey fire you?
It's all right.
I'm just going out of my mind.
You'll feel better after you've had some sleep.
I seriously doubt it, but I might as well try.
- What are you doing?
- Getting undressed.
Not in front of her, you're not.
I am going to take Miss Vanita downstairs and tie her up on the patio.
That's better.
Don't miss part two of "Cousin Serena Strik es Again" next week.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Serena.
I might have known.
Who were you expecting?
Steve McQueen?
Samantha, may I present Clio Vanita?
- Darling.
- How do you Naughty boy.
Did you not promise to take me to lunch?
And yet you never called.
Come to Rome with me.
What for?
Don't answer that.
No one is going to make a monkey out of my cousin.
- Where's Miss Vanita?
- Right up there.
You took a live client and turned her into a monkey?
Serena did it.
I've sent emergency calls out everywhere.
No response.
Serena's just being stubborn.
Sam, what are we going to do?
That monkey has to be at a meeting at 11:00 tomorrow.
Hey.
Sweetheart, what's the matter?
Oh, boy.
What a horrible nightmare.
I dreamt that one of our clients was over for dinner.
Clio Vanita of the Vanita wine account.
Sweetheart, she was here for dinner last night.
That was last night?
And it wasn't a dream.
What?
Samantha, isn't there anything you can do to get Serena to come here?
A spell you can cast?
A hex?
Something?
I've alerted every member of the family to be on the lookout for Serena.
They know how important it is.
All we can do is wait.
Sam, I've got an 11:00 meeting at the office with Larry and that monkey to sign a new contract.
What am I to do?
Get a monkey-print for a signature?
I' II tell you one thing: We mortals may not be perfect but if we could change a person into a monkey our scientists would certainly find a way to change him back.
What am I saying?
I must be having a nervous breakdown.
- Spaghetti?
- It's the only thing she'd eat.
- Will she remember any of this?
- No.
Shut up, you rotten little monkey!
- It's Serena, she's come back.
- Darrin.
Since when does Serena ring the doorbell?
I lost my head.
- Gosh, it's Larry.
Keep her out of sight.
- Why?
I told Larry I drove Clio home last night.
If he sees her You' re right.
I'd better get ahold of myself.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Darrin.
I thought you and I could drive into work and you can fill me in on things.
- What are you talking about?
- What do you think?
Cute, the way you manoeuvred it last night so you could drive Clio home.
So don't keep me in suspense.
Did you patch it up?
Hey.
Cut it out.
- Did you find out who it belongs to?
- Not yet.
Will you stop that?
Sorry, sweetheart.
She got away from me.
- Morning, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
Looks like you've got a rival.
Well, let's face it, this boy's got a fatal attraction for blonds.
- I noticed that last night.
- I was just kidding.
I wasn't.
If you' re talking about Clio Vanita, let me assure you that Darrin Larry, I'm not ready to leave, and I don't want to make you late so Oh, yeah.
Well, I'd better be going.
- Honey.
- I' II take her.
And please keep trying to reach that party.
I will.
Come on.
Look at the cute little way she swings her hips.
Larry!
I was talking about the monkey.
Well, I' II see you later, then, huh?
What'd I forget?
Oh, yeah.
The reason I stopped by.
- What about Clio?
- What about her?
Well, what happened when you drove her home last night?
Why Yes, Sam?
- What is it?
- I thought you called me.
Didn't you call me?
Well, either way, I' II be with you in a minute.
Larry was just leaving.
I' II tell you all about it later, Larry.
- But l - So long, so long.
- What was all that about?
- I had to get rid of him.
Where's Clio?
I tied her up out on the patio.
Sam, I don't know how much longer I can keep this up.
If we don't Yoo-hoo, Samantha, I'm back.
What are you doing in that outfit?
What else do you wear to go boating on the Nile?
I never thought I'd say it, but am I glad to see you.
I wish I could say the same.
Serena, Darrin's just trying to be nice.
It's a hopeless task.
And, now, are you two going to stop bugging me?
Of course, as soon as you change that monkey back into my client.
Please, Serena?
Well, we' re all sugar and spice today, aren't we?
Yesterday, it was straight arsenic and old lace.
That's because Darrin isn't a spiteful person, Serena.
He He realizes that he was a little unfair to you, and he's sorry.
- Aren't you, dear?
- I've never been sorrier.
Serena, please.
Time is of the essence.
Don't know how I'm going to explain to Clio where she was but I' II figure that out when Sam, where's the monkey?
I tied her right Oh, dear.
She must have slipped the noose.
No use wasting a good noose.
I' II just hang myself.
Oh, now, Darrin, stop that.
She must be somewhere in the neighbourhood.
Well, as long as you don't need me, I' II be getting back.
But we do need you.
Someone has to stay with Tabitha.
And as soon as we find the monkey, you have to change her back.
And for Pete's sake, will you put some clothes on?
Clio.
Clio.
Clio, where are you?
Oh, Clio.
Come here, Clio.
Clio.
Clio.
I got a nice banana for you.
Oh, Clio.
Yoo-hoo, Clio.
Everybody's a critic.
Clio.
You did see a monkey?
Where?
Where?
Darrin, come quick.
Where'd you see it?
A friend found one this morning.
He took it home.
A friend of his found the monkey and took it home.
- A blond monkey?
- Yeah.
Excuse us.
The meeting's in 45 minutes.
I' II go and stall Larry while you get the monkey and You know what.
- Will you get going so I can go?
Okay.
Bye.
- Where's this friend of yours?
- He didn't know who it belonged to.
It didn't have a licence or anything.
That's the reason he took it home.
We don't want to cause your friend trouble, we just want the monkey.
- 134 Elm.
- 134 Elm.
Thanks.
And, boy, will his mother be glad to see you.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Do you know what that monkey did to my place?
- Believe me, I' II pay for any damage.
- Believe me, I know you will.
It tore my curtains, broke a lamp Oh, and not just any lamp.
It has to be the lamp my mother-in-law gave us, and she knows I hate it.
What am I gonna tell her?
Broke three dishes from my best china - Sorry if you've been inconvenienced - Inconvenienced?
My house is a wreck.
Would $20 make you happy?
That's all?
How much happiness do you want?
How about 30?
How about 25?
I' II take it.
Now may I have the monkey?
Are you kidding?
You don't think I'd keep that little monster here.
- What did you do with her?
- My kid took her down to the pet shop.
Goddard's on Main Street.
And, personally, I think he was taken advantage of.
He only got $10.
What are you doing?
Taking a little happiness for myself.
You sold the monkey already?
Lady, it was one of the fastest turnovers I ever had.
- Who bought her?
- A fellow named Joe Scibetta.
He took one look at that monkey and fell in love.
"Scibetta".
Wonder if he knew Clio's Italian.
- What?
- Never mind.
May I use your phone?
Sure.
Help yourself.
Say, I hope that monkey wasn't stolen.
- No, she just ran away.
- Because I'm a reputable dealer, and Mr. Stephens, please.
Mrs. Stephens.
Could you tell me where Joe Scibetta lives?
I can't tell you his exact address, but I can tell you where you can find him.
Oh, hi, Darrin.
Yes, I know it's 11:30.
No, she wasn't there.
You don't have to remind me that Clio's account is worth half a million dollars.
I thought you said Clio was the monkey's name.
It is.
I'm just as anxious as you are to get her back there, but I may be delayed.
Look, why don't you make it a luncheon meeting?
You and Larry and Clio can have a couple of drinks, eat in the boardroom.
Oh, my, oh, my, I knew I sold that monkey too cheap.
No!
I'm no sell this monkey for all the money in the world.
But you have to sell her to me.
She Well, I know this monkey very well and she just won't be happy doing this kind of work.
What are you talking about?
She's the best monkey I've ever had.
Look at this monkey.
Look how happy, huh?
Blonds have more fun.
No.
No, I no sell her for nothing.
Suppose I get you another monkey?
No.
With this monkey, I'm gonna make my dream come true.
Dream?
Ever since I come to this country, I have one dream in my heart.
- What's that?
- To go back to old country.
Mr. Scibetta how would you like a free trip back to Italy?
You make joke with me, huh?
No, no.
What I have in mind is Hey, Scibetta.
What did we tell you about operating without a permit?
- Oh, you tell me get one.
- Well?
- I get one.
- You' re a wise guy, huh?
Officer, if that's all, we' re in a bit of a hurry.
So come along, Mr. - Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Is that a new monkey?
Oh, yeah, sure, sure.
She's a beaut, huh?
Oh, yes, very cute.
Where is the monkey's licence?
Oh, well, I just buy her.
I no have chance to get a licence.
An animal has to be processed to make sure he's not a menace to health.
There I think I can help you.
I happen to know that this monkey is in perfect health.
If anything, she's too healthy.
That may be as it is, lady, but I am still taking that animal into custody.
- No, you can't do that.
- Well, I think otherwise.
It It bit me!
Come here.
Come back to your papa!
Clio!
Come back!
Come back!
Where are you going?
Where you How did she do that?
Oh, there's something weird about that dame, and I'm gonna find out what it is.
Halt!
Lady, I'm warning you.
I'm gonna count three, and then I'm coming in.
One two Do you hear me?
- Where's the monkey?
- What monkey?
Mrs. Stephens All right, if that's the way it's gotta be.
And just what did you have in mind?
Thank you, Serena.
I think you better get back to Tabitha.
Cousin, how much longer do I have to babysit?
Oh, just a little while longer.
And I promise I' II do the same for you someday.
I sincerely hope not.
I just remembered something.
This isn't my beat.
Where am I?
Why, we' re on our way to your meeting with Darrin and Larry Tate.
Darrin suggested that I pick you up, because you weren't feeling too well when he drove you back to your hotel last night.
I know how you feel but don't worry, you look marvellous.
I guess you must be a little confused, huh?
I'm a whole lots confused.
Where's my little monkey?
Well, it's rather difficult to explain, but it really doesn't matter.
Now, here's what I'd like you to do.
- No question about it, she's sore at us.
- Why do you keep saying that?
Because she was due at 11, and it's now 1:30.
- Three minutes to 1:30.
- What's the difference?
If she wasn't sore, wouldn't she have called?
Not necessarily.
She might not be in a position to call.
- What do you mean?
- She could have been in an accident.
Oh, well, that would certainly make me feel better.
- Larry, I don't mean she was in a - Darrin.
What went on last night after we left?
You know, something happened with Clio.
I know it.
Now, why don't you level with me?
Larry, there's nothing to tell.
The last I saw of Clio, she was in fine spirits, not a care in the world.
Chattering away, hopping up and down.
Hopping up and down?
Well Yes?
Mrs. Stephens is here with Miss Vanita.
Thank you.
Send them in.
How about that?
Excuse me, I'm so sorry, but I guess I overslept.
Oh, sit down.
Clio, you naughty girl, you really tied one on last night.
Yes, well, Darrin makes a pretty powerful drink.
Lots of times I find that I can't remember what went on at his house.
The reason we' re late is it took me a little time to find the right kind of models that you asked for.
- Oh, yes, the models.
- Models?
To go with the new slogan that Darrin came up with.
Darrin, why didn't you tell me about it?
Well, I didn't want you to share the blame in case it didn't go over.
But what is it?
I tried it out on Sam to get the feminine point of view and she seemed to like it.
So, Sam, why don't you try it out on Clio?
Better yet, why don't we show them?
You' re gonna love it.
I certainly hope so.
Sweetheart, is this what you had in mind?
Oh, I think so.
- Would you mind letting us in on it?
- In on what?
I'm beginning to think I wasn't the only one who had a lot to drink last night.
The slogan, Darrin, the slogan.
Are you ready?
I'm past ready and on my way to angry.
Go ahead, Sam, tell them.
Well, sweetheart, it's your idea.
You tell them.
Sam.
Yeah, well, okay.
You see, Darrin wanted to use the organ grinder and his monkey to illustrate his slogan, which is: "Don't monkey around with anything but the best.
Drink Vino Vanita".
No wonder you wanted Samantha to say it.
- I think it is sensational.
- I love it.
Didn't I tell you he was a genius?
The organ grinder reminds us of Italy, no?
And the little monkey, charming.
How does it go?
Don't fool around with anything but the best.
I love it.
- Actually, it's "Don't monkey around" - Forget it, Darrin.
We made the sale.
We also have a commercial jingle for Vino Vanita that ties in with these same models.
- We do?
That we could discuss sometime late tomorrow.
"Don't monkey around with anything but the best".
"Monkey around".
It does have a ring to it, no?
Yes, it does, doesn't it?
Higgledy-piggledy, my red hen She lays eggs for gentlemen.
Read me another one, Auntie Serena.
Okay, sweets.
Jack be nimble Jack be quick Jack jump over the candlestick.
More.
Here comes your father, the spoilsport.
- What's the meaning of this?
- Beats me.
I don't groove on these nursery rhymes at all but they sure flip the kid.
Samantha, why don't you take Tabitha into the kitchen for some cookies and milk?
I want to stay and hear you scream, Daddy.
Sam.
Darrin, Serena was just entertaining Tabitha the only way she knows how.
So don't be And I'm going to be as gracious as I know how.
I hope so.
Come on, sweetheart.
Serena, if you' II be good enough to get rid of that l'd like to have a little chat with you.
Well, if we must, we must.
Thank you.
Serena, there's no sense in trying to be gracious with you so I' II make my point.
The next time you visit here I'd like to make one simple request.
- What's that?
- Don't.
Cousin-in-law, if that's as gracious as you can be I am going to show you how entertaining I can be.
Oh, Serena, you're a riot.
Sam!
Darrin, you promised me you were gonna be - and you weren't.
Samantha, do something.
Serena, please?
Not until he apologises.
Darrin, apologise.
- What for?
- What for?
He insulted me.
I did not insult her.
- You didn't?
- No!
In order for someone to be insulted they have to have feelings.
That did it.
And he can stay that way till doomsday.
- Sam, don't let her go.
Get her back.
- It's no use, sweetheart.
You' II just have to wait until Serena cools off.
And what do I do in the meantime?
Well, don't worry.
With your luck, doomsday may be just around the corner.
Sam.
Well?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
This dress is gonna be very pretty on you, Tabitha.
- It doesn't look like a dress.
- That's because it isn't finished yet.
Will it be a dress before Daddy comes home?
No.
You see, first you have to cut it out and then you pin it and put it on to see if it fits.
- Then is it a dress?
- Well, almost.
It takes a long time, and it's hard work.
- I know how to do it quick.
- No.
Now, Tabitha, you know Daddy doesn't want us to use witchcraft.
- Silly Mommy.
- Good grief.
- You sound just like Mother.
- Honey, I'm home.
Daddy, guess what Mommy's doing.
She's making a dress all by herself.
- She isn't even going to the store.
- I know, I know.
And it's coming along just fine.
My wife, the dressmaker.
- Sam, I'm proud of you.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
Tabitha, run along upstairs and start getting ready for bed, okay?
Okay, Mommy.
- Thought I forgot, didn't you?
- Forgot what?
Happy sixth anniversary of our first date.
I knew you'd remember.
Darrin, it's lovely.
"Come Back to Sorrento".
Oh, sweetheart, it's beautiful.
And we' re going to celebrate at Sorrento's tonight.
I called Marcello, and he's holding a table for us.
What a surprise.
And just in case you surprised me I asked Mother to sit with Tabitha.
On second thought, I' II send out for pizzas.
- Sweetheart, don't press your luck.
- I' II start getting ready.
- Something new from the big spender?
- Oh, Mother, must you eavesdrop?
Well, someone has to look after my daughter's interests.
Look at you, making Tabitha's clothes.
Samantha, you've been reduced to a slave in Durwood's sweatshop.
- Mother, please.
- Well, all right.
Obviously, you' re just too starry-eyed to realize what's happening to you.
I have everything I want.
When I think of the luxuries you've given up - Mother.
- What?
You give up.
I'm going upstairs and get ready.
- Miss Miss Wilson?
- Yes?
I would like to see Mr. Darrin Stephens, please.
- You have an appointment?
- No, no.
People don't make appointments with crackpots.
- You' re a crackpot?
- No, no, but people usually think I am.
What'd you want to see Mr. Stephens about?
Isn't he cute?
I would like to talk to Mr. Stephens about helping market the little fellow.
It's amazing.
He kind of gives you a feeling of well-being.
Well, you've heard of the Hula-Hoop, Silly Putty, the drinking bird, Frisbee and now the Fuzz.
I've got a hunch this little fella could catch on.
Oh, believe me, he will.
- Excuse me, Mr - Professor.
- Professor Mac Allister.
- Excuse me, professor.
I' II see if Mr. Stephens can squeeze in a few moments for you.
Yes?
Are you terribly busy, Mr. Stephens?
Yes, but what is it, Miss Wilson?
I know it's my job to brush off all the oddballs but there's a gentleman here I think you ought to see.
You recommend this oddball?
Mr. Stephens, do I bother you very often?
Okay, send him in.
Mr. Stephens, this is Professor Mac Allister.
- How do you do?
- Good of you to see me, Mr. Stephens.
I have created a little doll.
- May I show it to you?
- Of course.
- Isn't it just darling?
- I call it the Fuzz.
And it Well, I don't know.
It kind of makes you feel good.
Yeah, it does.
I modestly think there's something about this that will make everybody want one.
I agree, professor.
What can I do to help?
If you' II supply the creative merchandising necessary to sell them l' II supply the dolls, and we' II split 50-50.
But why me?
Now, Mr. Stephens, it's no secret along Madison Avenue that you are a very successful advertising man.
You have connections.
Possibly you could place the doll in a local department store just to see if it catches on.
How much do these dolls cost to make?
Practically nothing.
That is, if it's sold for a dollar we'd each make a quarter and the store would make a quarter.
If it catches on, that could add up.
Darrin, Henderson is in my office, and Professor Mac Allister, this is Mr. Tate.
How do you do?
- What's that?
- Oh, that, Mr. Tate is a little doll I've created that'll sweep the country.
I agree the country needs sweeping, but a doll isn't going to do it.
It kind of makes you feel good.
Yeah, it does.
He's a cute little character.
Well, Lar how do you feel about McMann and Tate launching the Fuzz?
The professor has offered a 50-50 deal.
Darrin, I'm too old to play with dolls.
And I have a $2 million account waiting that makes me feel a lot better than the Fuzz.
Now let's start moving the wagons.
I've got a hunch about this little fellow.
We handle the advertising for Hanley's Department Store.
Call Jim Hanley and ask him to set up a display of the Fuzz at their entrance tomorrow.
Give him the details.
Yes, Mr. Stephens.
Could you deliver Oh, I think I'd better deliver 500, just in case.
That's what I like, an optimistic partner.
- It's been a pleasure knowing you.
- Thank you.
If you leave your telephone number with Miss Wilson we' II let you know how we do.
Hi, darling.
Hi there, sweetheart.
- Tabitha.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.
- Oh, what's that?
Sam, believe it or not, I am dabbling in the doll business.
It's cute.
There's something about it The funny nose, the long hair.
- That makes people feel good.
Here, now, hold it and see.
Well, I like it, but You don't get any message, huh?
That's funny.
- Everybody at the office wanted one.
- No telling what people might like.
- Here, sweetheart.
This is for you.
- Thank you.
That's nice, Daddy.
It's one of those things that people just can't put down.
No man's a prophet in his own home.
- Yes?
- Pardon, Mr. Tate but it's important that I speak to Mr. Stephens.
It's about the doll.
Would you people mind doing your moonlighting after office hours?
- That's why they call it moonlighting.
- Sorry, Larry.
- What about the dolls, Miss Wilson?
- I'm so excited I could scream.
- So could I. - Mr. Hanley called a few minutes ago and said they're already out of the dolls.
They sold all 500 by 11:00.
Hey, they really like that little character.
Big deal.
So you peddled 500 dolls.
The professor's rushing another 2000 over there right now.
- Wow, how about that?
- Yeah, how about that?
And listen to this, Mr. Stephens.
Mr. Hanley wants 200, 000 for their stores all over the country.
How long will it take the professor He said in a couple of days he'll have the dolls.
Sooner, if we want them.
Right.
Well, carry on, Miss Wilson and try not to let Mr. Tate catch you using the company phone.
Two hundred thousand dolls Will you quit fooling around with those nickels and dimes?
That's $5000.
Five thousand dollars?
You must've made a mistake.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You've got the decimal point in the wrong place.
That's fifty thousand dollars.
Yes, you' re right!
It's an oil well, a gold mine.
Fifty thousand dollars.
And you say you gave Miss Wilson 10 percent?
- That's $5000.
- Yeah.
And nothing for me.
Larry, if you remember, I offered to split this deal with you.
Let's not cloud the issue with facts.
Let's get busy on this.
This is an advertising office, not a doll factory.
You wouldn't mind if I went home a little early today, would you?
I'd like to do a little shopping for Sam and Tabitha.
Tell them the good news.
Darrin, I find that remark to be in very bad taste.
Sorry.
Turn around this way.
Turn around.
I don't think I've got that quite right.
Hi, Sam, Tabitha.
Well, hi, sweetheart.
You' re home early.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, darling.
Larry gave me the afternoon off.
For reasons that will become apparent, he can't look at me without breaking into tears.
Now close your eyes and pucker up.
Hey, this is fun.
Solid gold.
Real jewels on both sides.
Well, that's certainly something I wouldn't buy for myself.
Honey, don't you get it?
If you want something, just whistle.
- Sometimes you baffle me.
- Try it.
Yes, right this way.
A few little presents.
Right this way.
An original Lili Arlege dress from Paris, designed especially for little girls who have rich daddies.
- I like this dress better.
Well, I'm glad someone feels that way.
Sam, the dress you' re making is great but you don't have to do that anymore.
Darrin, I love doing that kind of thing.
What's happened?
Sam, those little dolls are a smash.
People are fighting to buy them.
There's something awfully strange about all this if you know what I mean.
An ermine coat, for strolling in the park.
That's what it is, all right an ermine coat, for strolling in the park.
Didn't you get her a mink playsuit to go with it?
Sam, you know there's no such thing as a mink playsuit.
So I got her one in chinchilla.
Mother, I insist that you appear before me immediately.
Yes, my precious.
You called?
- Mother, what've you been up to?
- Isn't it obvious?
I've been spearfishing with Prince Cellini in the Arctic Sea.
What a soggy bore, but he does have a fascinating igloo.
You know what I'm talking about.
Did you put a spell on a dumb little doll?
Oh, my dear child, are you all right?
Don't evade the issue.
Mother, Darrin's involved with some little doll Oh, my poor darling.
What's her name?
Oh, never mind her name.
Get Tabitha, and let's leave.
Don't bother to pack.
Mother, really.
It's a toy doll that everyone wants to buy.
Darrin's making a fortune and it's my guess that it's your spell.
It's probably one of those affairs that keep happening to mortals.
Mother.
Are you sure you didn't put some kind of spell?
- Witch's honour.
- You' re absolutely sure?
Samantha, have I ever lied to you?
Well?
Fine.
Thank you very much.
The professor delivered 5,000 dolls to the Detroit store.
Good, good.
Would you get that, honey?
What the Fuzz factory needs is a full-time doorman.
Good idea.
Make a note of that, Miss Wilson.
The professor says the additional 200,000 dolls will be on their way tomorrow.
We have to answer the call from Yakamoto Department Store regarding the Tokyo franchise.
One sunken Roman bathtub, lady.
Where do you want it?
I'd hate to tell you.
This is too much.
Darrin, that thing won't fit in our bathroom.
Lady, let's not have a domestic squabble.
- This thing weighs a ton.
- Darrin.
Oh, the birdbath.
It goes in the backyard.
Watch out for the furniture.
Darrin would you take your Fuzz business to the office?
I promised Larry I wouldn't work on this there.
I covered the whole house.
Nine rooms, nine colour TV sets.
Just what we need the Roller Derby in every room.
Oh, Mr. Stephens?
I wanna check tomorrow's appointments with you.
One thirty, Mr. Merrick, about backing a Broadway musical.
Two o'clock, Mr. Craft, about the yacht.
And 2:30, Mr. Palmer, measure you for golf clubs.
And you mustn't forget to call Truman Capote for his guest list.
I've already done that.
It's on the way.
I'm sorry to barge in, but I wasn't able to get you on the phone.
Sorry.
I wanted to finish the Fuzz business before I came into the office.
I know it upsets you.
Don't forget the professor came to McMann and Tate not Darrin Stephens, Incorporated.
- Well, I appreciate that, Lar.
- It's Norman Gimbel.
You' II have to tell him the New York franchise is gone.
Well, I guess I'm just an easygoing, good-hearted guy so here's what I'm going to do.
This is an agreement giving you 10 percent of your accounts, in exchange for half your interest in the Fuzz which, by rights, should be mine anyway.
That sounds like a fair deal.
Well, congratulations, both of you.
Larry, welcome to the doll business and thank you for this percentage.
I loved doing it.
- I was gonna give it to you anyway.
- You were?
See you at the office, you son of a gun.
- Okay.
- So long, Sam.
Stephens, how do you like the styling?
Oh, that is perfect, Cosmo.
Same time tomorrow.
- Miss Wilson?
- That's probably Miss Dobrin.
Sam, prepare yourself for a real surprise.
After all that's happened today nothing could surprise me.
It's the new house!
- New house?
- Not just a house the Bedlington estate.
Here it is, Mr. Stephens.
It sits majestically in the centre of 80 rolling acres.
Swimming pool, tennis courts, polo fields.
It's just got everything.
Not quite everything.
Where are the his and hers heliports?
Good suggestion, Sam.
We' II tear out the formal gardens and put them there.
Darrin, I don't want to move.
You know how I love this house.
Sweetheart, this was a great little place in its day, but we gotta think big.
Don't worry about selling this place, Mrs. Stephens.
There's a great demand for these lower-priced homes.
However it's a shame there isn't something more distinctive about this house.
A sunken living room, for example.
If you' II stand right over here, I' II see what I can do.
I think I've seen enough, Mr. Stephens.
We' II have a sign up in the morning.
Miss Wilson, would you excuse us for a minute, please?
Oh, certainly.
I' II get myself a cup of coffee.
Darrin, I must talk to you.
Right now.
- Now - Okay, honey.
What's the problem?
Well, problem number one is I think there's something funny about that little doll of yours and problem number two is you.
In what way am I a problem?
Sweetheart, it's not like you to go off the deep end.
Well, honey, it's just that I've I've always wanted the very best for you and Tabitha.
When we were married, you made a big sacrifice for me.
No, you did.
You gave up you-know-what.
I realize I'm probably overdoing it, but this money is my chance to give you all the things you could've had.
Darrin, all the money in the world couldn't buy what we already have.
I know that, Sam.
Just let me have the joy of overdoing it for a little while.
That may be the nicest thing you've ever said to me, maybe.
And it's only the beginning.
A castle in Spain.
A château in France The Onassis island.
I wonder if that's for sale.
Miss Wilson.
Miss Wilson, we have work to do.
Oh, my stars.
Mother, I insist that you appear before me this minute or this house will be off-limits to you forever.
Really, Samantha.
I try to be attentive but you certainly can't blame me for wanting to finish my slalom.
Mother, you' re not telling me the truth.
Honestly, my darling, I was skiing.
You know what I mean.
It's about Darrin.
Well, I gave you my witch's honour.
I love Darrin, and I can tell when he's under a spell.
Now, the truth.
Is there a spell on those dolls and on Darrin?
I wish you'd phrase that question a little differently.
I knew it.
I knew it!
Someone else did your dirty work, right?
Oh, the burdens of a mother with an ungrateful child.
- Yeah, yeah, Mother.
Get on with it.
- I' II take care of it right away.
Oh, dear.
Honey, I can say one thing for Mother.
She meant well.
I guess I should've realized.
I feel ridiculous, the way I've been acting.
Well, you acted normally, under the circumstances.
- Sam, I'm a pauper.
- Well, I wouldn't go quite that far.
But you will be a little busy the next few days returning gifts.
- Sam, what can I say?
- You don't have to say anything.
- There is a bright side to all this.
- What's that?
I can hardly wait to see Larry's face when he finally finds out how fast the Fuzz fad flops.
Darrin, where have you been?
It's 2:00.
I had a few diamond bracelets and things to return.
- You knew it.
- Knew what?
The calls started coming around noon.
Nobody wants the Fuzz anymore.
The stores are returning them.
They don't even make you feel good anymore.
- You' re right.
- The fad's faded.
The bubble's burst.
It's as if someone turned them all off at the same time.
You win some, you lose some.
And you were returning the diamonds because you knew it was going to happen.
You took advantage of my greed.
- Sam just didn't want the bracelets.
- A likely story.
- Darrin, this is despicable.
- Larry, you haven't lost anything.
I lost the millions I was going to make and 10 percent of all the accounts you handle.
You said you were going to give that to me anyway.
I just said that to make you miserable.
- Hi, honey.
I'm home.
- Hi there, sweetheart.
How about Sorrento's for dinner tonight?
Who's going to sit with Tabitha?
We are.
Now you wait right here and don't peek.
You promise?
Okay.
All right, sweetheart.
You can come in now.
Buono appetito, Daddy.
Sam, this is just great.
And you were never better, Marcello.
And that is the prettiest dress I've ever seen.
I wonder where Mommy learned to sew.
- From her mommy.
- I doubt that.
Unless her mommy took sewing lessons from Betsy Ross.
Darrin.
How did you know?
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Sweetheart, do you know where my slippers are?
Right there, my sweet, by your feet.
That's cute.
"Right there, my sweet, by your feet".
That's what I said.
Just popped into my head.
Hey, you did it again.
Well, skiddy-skat, imagine that.
You're very poetic this morning.
Darrin.
I hate to burst your bubble, but I think I'm in trouble.
You're in trouble?
Whenever I speak, every time, my words come out in rhyme.
Sweetheart, are you sick?
No.
I feel okay, but my speech is astray.
Well, are you telling me you're talking in rhyme because you can't help it?
That's right.
You're bright.
Has this ever happened to you before?
Never in my life.
On my word of honour as your wife.
Can't you say anything that doesn't rhyme?
I can try, you handsome guy.
I'll bet Uncle Arthur put a spell on you.
It's typical of his warped sense of humour.
No.
No, he's not the one.
He'd pop in to watch the fun.
What about your mother?
Darrin, blood is thicker than water.
She wouldn't do this to her daughter.
Well, don't worry, sweetheart.
We'll find out what caused it.
In the meantime, just stay calm.
There must be a logical answer or my name is not "Samanswer".
Tabitha, eat your eggs.
They're good for your legs.
Tabitha.
Are you still talking in rhyme?
You bet I am.
Would you like some jam?
Oh, no, thanks.
I'll just have some coffee.
I'll pour it myself.
Frankly, sweetheart all of this is beginning to get a little bit on my nerves.
It's also getting on mine.
But I'm sure that soon I'll be fine.
Have you been able to get ahold of Dr. Bombay?
Whenever you're in poor condition, you can never reach your family physician.
Why don't you give him another try?
Calling Dr. Bombay.
Calling Dr. Bombay.
Emergency.
Come right away.
Daddy, is Mommy sick?
Oh, no, dear.
Mommy's fine.
She's just talking funny, that's all.
Maybe Endora knows where he is.
Or maybe she knows what's wrong.
Mother, dear, please heed my call.
Your daughter's back is to the wall.
Sam, that's terrible.
Fiddle-de-dee, it's no fun for me.
Good morning, Samantha.
Dear little Tabitha.
What do you mean your back is to the wall?
I'm having trouble with my words, and it's strictly for the birds.
She got up this morning talking in rhyme, and she can't stop it.
She can't?
How peculiar.
I summoned Dr. Bombay.
He didn't obey.
Dr. Bombay is on vacation.
Oh, fiddle-de-dee, no doctor for me.
He's mountain climbing in Switzerland.
He's on an alp when I need "halp".
Oh, Samantha.
Rhymes, yes.
But puns?
No.
I'll find Dr. Bombay and I'll have him give me a potion for you.
Oh, Mother, your consideration will be my salvation.
Oh, great galaxies.
But goodbye, darling.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
See you later, mater.
Well, I guess I'd better get to the office.
I suggest that you stay home.
Don't answer the doorbell or the telephone unless the phone rings once, stops, then rings again.
As a code to let me know how you're doing.
Okay?
One ring, that's all.
Then I answer your call.
So long, little sweetheart.
So long, big sweetheart.
Keep cool.
It's hard to keep cool when you talk like a fool.
Frankly, Larry.
I find your making social engagements for Samantha and myself without consulting me in bad character.
That's not bad character.
It's my character.
Darrin, this dinner is not social.
It's a sugarcoated business appointment.
A little food, a little booze and a lot of business.
But why Samantha?
Mr. Durfee carefully pointed out that Mrs. Durfee wants to meet the wife of the man who's personally handling the account.
I don't like the idea of Samantha being auditioned.
Why not?
Sam makes a great impression.
I prefer doing business in a business environment.
And I prefer doing business the way the client prefers it.
Darrin, call Sam and tell her to line up a baby sitter.
Hi there, sweetheart.
I'm feeling fine.
I was cutting some roses from the vine.
Sweetheart, we're very close to landing the Durfee Dog Food account.
In fact, Mr. And Mrs. Durfee have invited us and Larry out to dinner tomorrow night.
Look, the door's open.
Gladys, that's snooping.
It is not.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
I think I "oughter" put the flowers in some water.
Mrs. Stephens, come back.
There.
You satisfied?
She's calling the police to report you for illegal entry.
Our only choice is to apologise.
Mrs. Stephens, I know you're angry but please give me a chance to tell you how sorry I am for my wife's stupidity.
Mrs. Kravitz is a frustrated international spy.
An open door to her is like a bag of peanuts to an elephant.
I understand the psychology, and I accept your apology.
Thank you.
We came to ask you to sign this petition.
It's to instal a traffic light on our mutual corner.
A traffic light is right, I'm sure.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
You're talking in rhyme.
What is it, some new kind of a parlour game?
Yes.
It's a parlour game, and it's the most.
It's all the rage from coast to coast.
I never heard of it.
Neither did I, but I'll give it a try.
Oh, that rhymes.
I did it.
For a beginner, you're a winner.
Come on, Gladys, play the game.
Or else Or else Or else of you I'll be ashamed.
Oh, Abner, stop it.
Mrs. Stephens, may I have my petition?
Mrs. Kravitz, I sincerely hope I didn't offend you and for your good citizenship I commend you.
Abner, come.
She wouldn't try it even once because when it comes to thinking fast on her feet she is a dunce.
- Oh, stop it.
Don't shove, my love.
Hi.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Tabitha.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.
I had a close call with Mrs. Kravitz.
She came uninvited, one of her favourite habits.
Samantha, I'm sorry it took so long, but Dr. Bombay wasn't in Switzerland.
He was mountain climbing in Tibet.
I told him you have a Venetian verbal virus and he said this would knock it right out.
Hello?
Yes, Larry.
Change of plan.
The Durfees are leaving town tomorrow so our dinner party's for tonight.
Tonight?
I can make it, but I'm not sure Sam can.
She has a little virus.
I know I didn't mention it to you at the office, but Darrin, don't make waves.
I don't need to remind you that Durfee's Dog Food is a $2 million account.
Give Sam a couple of aspirin.
I'll pick you up at 7:30.
Change of plans.
Our dinner with the client is tonight.
Samantha can't go out tonight.
She's ill.
I'm hoping Boy, am I hoping she'll have a speedy recovery.
Dr. Bombay assured me that this potion works instantly.
Over the lips and past the gums.
Look out tummy, here it comes.
Did it do the trick, or am I still sick?
Oh, no.
Sam, what are we gonna do?
Oh, I know what I'll do.
I'll return to Dr. Bombay and accuse him of malpractice.
She went back to call him a quack.
Before dinner, if you don't get rid of this thing everyone'll think you're a ding-a-ling.
Fiddle-de-dee, you sound like me.
Mommy, Daddy, is something wrong?
Yes, dear.
Something is wrong.
Would you tell me what it is?
You tell her, as one W-l-T-C-H to another.
There once was a mommy named Sam whose speech got her into a jam.
Though she tried not to show it, she talked like a poet.
If you think I'm unhappy, I am.
That's funny, Mommy.
Sweetheart, I hope you're not getting all dressed up for nothing.
In case I'm cured by a last-minute miracle I have to be ready, don't I, "dearacle"?
It's getting worse.
When Larry shows up l'll tell him you're in bed with a raging fever.
Honey, don't overdo.
Just tell him I've come down with a flu.
Sam, it's 7:25.
He's picking us up at 7:30.
Well, where's the patient?
I want to get back to Mount Everest before sunrise.
Samantha!
Dr. Bombay is here!
Good old Mother.
She's like no other.
Let's go below and start the show.
You know, Endora, there are very few witches I would do this for.
Yes.
I know, Dr. Bombay, and we're deeply grateful.
Dr. Bombay.
Oh, good evening, doc.
What a pleasant shock.
Good evening, Samantha.
Evening, Darby.
Durwood.
- Just get on with it.
- Yes.
Well, when Endora told me my potion had failed to work I graciously volunteered to come and examine you.
Well, can you do it in a hurry?
In five minutes we have to scurry.
Is that your only symptom, talking in rhyme?
Yes.
Plus emotional distress.
Let me Let me examine your elbow.
Her elbow?
Because it's centrally located.
Yes.
You see, the elbow's connected to the arm bone.
And the arm bone's connected to the shoulder bone.
- The shoulder bone's connected to - Forget it.
Highly irregular.
She does not have Venetian verbal virus.
She doesn't have verbal virus at all.
That's what happens when a layman makes a diagnosis.
- Well, what does she have?
- I'll tell you after I take a look at her with my amber corpuscular evaluator.
Which no home should be without.
Look.
Spots.
Just as I suspected.
Secondary vocabularyitis.
What causes it?
Oh, we don't know, but there's a lot of it going about.
Same family as verbal virus, but the cure is completely different.
I'm going to give you a sound-wave injection.
Sorry.
Thanks.
Now say something, Samantha.
Speak.
Well, what should I say?
Will my next sentence rhyme?
It didn't!
It worked!
Darrin, I'm cured.
- So I hear.
- Dr. Bombay, how can I thank you?
Simply stay healthy until I finish my vacation.
And now I bid you all good night.
There goes a great doctor and a great warlock.
And I always say, "Show me an executive with an intelligent wife and I'll show you an executive you can trust".
I agree 200 percent.
And your wife is not only intelligent, she's also charming and attractive.
That's very gracious of you, Mr. Durfee.
Now that we're through with the compliments what do we want to eat?
How about five orders of Durfee Dog Food?
Mrs. Stephens, you said that in a spirit of humour.
But there's more fact to it than fiction.
Durfee's Dog Food uses only the finest ingredients.
Lean, red hunks of pure beef fortified and enriched with That reminds me.
When do you boys plan to tell me about the new advertising campaign?
Oscar, please, don't talk shop.
This is a party.
She doesn't want to mix business with pleasure.
Mr. Durfee, your wife's a treasure.
Oh, that's cute.
I might as well warn you.
I'm going to be hard to convince that there's something more effective than: "Serve Durfee's Dog Food to Rex and Rover and their eating troubles will be over".
Please, let's change the subject.
Where did you get that dress?
It was designed by François Vale.
I bought it on sale.
Sam, what's with the rhyming?
Who, me?
Boop-doop-de-dee.
"Boop-doop-de-dee"?
Say, who beside me is hungry?
- I am.
- Me too, fiddle-de-doo.
Sam, will you stop that.
Me no can do.
Wowdy-woo.
Let's order.
Sam, I know you're trying to charm them but don't press.
Mrs. Stephens, you've hardly spoken during six courses.
And when she did, it was always in rhyme.
Cute, huh?
A little game we play all the time.
But enough is enough.
Okay, Sam?
I said, "Okay, Sam"?
Dear, don't you feel well?
I feel groovy.
Anyone seen a good movie?
There she goes again.
Mrs. Stephens, will you please do me a favour and stop this?
Yes, Mr. Durfee, purfee-wurfee.
Sweetheart, isn't this a good time to check the baby sitter?
I'll be back in a jiffy.
Dinner was spiffy.
I'm revising my opinion.
About what?
I'd rather not say.
Mother, the rhymes are flowing like a fountain.
Tell me the name of Bombay's mountain.
Mount Everest.
He's probably at the top by now.
The top of Mount Everest.
It's now or "neverest".
Samantha, you just made a mockery of my entire accomplishment.
You're a naughty witch.
Well, I'm sorry, Dr. Bombay, but I don't feel so hot.
- I think I need a booster shot.
- You do?
I hate to be terse, but it's getting worse.
Oh, yes.
Definitely a relapse.
I must have miscalculated.
It's not secondary vocabularyitis.
It's primary vocabularyitis.
I'll increase the dosage.
Oh, sorry.
Now, say something.
How now, brown horse?
Oh, Dr. Bombay, it worked!
Forgive me for bothering you.
I'm back.
And I won't rhyme that with anything.
That's good, honey.
Never push a good thing too far.
- Hope I didn't miss anything.
- Not a thing.
We've been talking about Durfee's Dog Food.
I meant we just started.
I was just saying, a slogan that's been with the company for three generations isn't easily discarded.
Mr. Durfee, don't you really think that jingles are outmoded?
Maybe yes.
Maybe no.
I agree with you.
That's a very perceptive answer.
I think jingles have become outmoded.
I just proved it to you by talking in rhyme until you all got irritated.
Larry, weren't you irritated?
No, not exactly.
- I was.
- So was I. Well, come to think of it, you know, I was kind of irritated too.
It was awful, and I said it to demonstrate that how after a while jingles can get on people's nerves.
Mr. Durfee, if you'll listen to my new campaign with an open mind, I'm sure - I'll listen.
I may lose an old friend, but I'll listen.
Tate, let's drop off the ladies and go down to your office.
I assume you have some artwork to show me.
Yes, sir, we do.
Oh, please, allow me.
- Oh, no, no.
You're my guests.
- No, no, no.
I insist.
Very well, Tate.
If you insist.
Thank you.
Just Larry's luck.
With the cheque he got stuck.
Sam.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'm just kidding.
- There you go.
- Good morning, beautiful girls.
- Good morning, Daddy.
- How'd you sleep?
Magnificently, as befits a man whose advertising campaign was approved by the client.
I can hardly wait to see it on television.
Hello, Tabitha.
- Hello, Grandmama.
- Hello, Samantha.
Hello, Darius.
The pleasure of seeing you is rather vicarious.
Sam, she rhymed.
Mother, say something else.
Why, that's absurd.
I'll not rhyme a single word.
She has it.
Yeah, she does.
My beloved mother-in-law has secondary vocabularyitis.
Primary.
This is absolutely outrageous.
You must have been contagious.
You probably caught it last night.
I'll check with an amber corpuscular evaluator.
Do I have spots like polka dots?
Yes.
Yes, I'm afraid you do.
Look, Mother.
You sit down and have some coffee.
And I'll get Dr. Bombay as soon as breakfast is finished.
While he's here, I'll have him vaccinate Tabitha just in case.
How about Daddy?
Oh, well, daddy's safe.
Mortals don't get primary vocabularyitis.
Let's hear it for mortals!
Darrin.
Durwood, I do not like the way you gloat so I'm turning you into a billy goat.
Mother!
How could you?
Like this, my darling miss.
You just turn him back.
I will.
I will.
But when I'm cured, and not until.
Oh, now, sweetheart.
Don't you worry.
Just as soon as I can, I'll get Dr. Bombay and everything will be back to normal.
I want to ride the billy goat.
Tabitha, this is your father.
Funny Daddy.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Hi, honey.
- Hi!
How's everything?
Everything is hungry.
What's for dinner?
Your favourite.
Irish stew.
Great.
Where's Tabitha?
Your mother brought her some modeling clay this afternoon.
She's upstairs testing her creativity.
I'll go take a look.
Hi, little octo-fish.
Your name is going to be Cynthia.
Hi, Tabitha.
Hi, Daddy.
I'm playing with my clay.
I think that's wonderful.
Where did that come from?
Cynthia came from my clay.
How did Cynthia come from your clay?
I looked at the toys on my shelf and I took clay and I went like this.
Hi, Country Cousin.
Say hello to Cynthia Octo-fish.
Samantha!
You're a good yeller, Daddy.
Samantha!
Samantha.
Sam?
Sam.
Tabitha is upstairs Don't tell me.
Let me guess.
- Tabitha is doing what comes naturally.
- Let me put it this way.
If Ed Sullivan ever caught our daughter's act, he'd book her forever.
Well, sweetheart, you can't really blame her.
I mean, after all, she is a I'm well aware of what she is.
But the fact remains, she's got to be taught to do things in the mortal way.
You're right, sweetheart.
If she knew how to use her hands she wouldn't be tempted to use witchcraft.
I agree, sweetheart.
That's how I feel about it, and I want something to be done.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll learn how to sculpt and then I can teach Tabitha the mortal way.
That's a good idea, Sam.
Darrin, what are you doing?
Eating a daisy.
Shall I mention that that's just a teeny bit ridiculous?
I admit it's ridiculous, but I can't help myself.
I think I'd better follow the bouncing ball.
"I've heard enough about the clay and Durwood pushing the mortal way.
I'll be watching as he grows wide with flowers piling up inside.
Love, Mother".
Now, that's what I call a meddling mother-in-law.
Mother, you come here right away and de-spell Darrin.
Your joke is in very poor taste.
No pun intended.
Mother!
You come here this instant!
Well, well, well.
It looks like Durwood is rehearsing to be a snail.
Well, well, well.
It's the queen of the sick jokes.
Darrin.
Mother, I know how you feel.
But don't you think you've gone a little bit too far?
Not at all.
I could have given him an appetite for rubber ducks.
She does have a point, Darrin.
I'd give you an argument if I weren't dying for a bouquet of zinnias.
What's-his-name is forcing my granddaughter to use her hands when she has the world at her nose.
I won't abide that, Samantha.
De-spell him, Mother.
Very well.
Samantha, your sense of values is becoming extremely polluted.
- And don't come back!
- Careful, sweetheart.
How about some Irish stew?
No, thanks, honey.
Your mother, the wicked witch, has spoiled my appetite.
- Yes?
- Mr. Waldon R. Campbell is here, sir.
Oh, send him in.
Send him in.
- Mr. Campbell, good to see you.
- Oh, yes.
Stephens.
Stephens.
Tate, nice-looking receptionist you got out there.
I like the way her chips are stacked.
If you fellas are anything like me, you'll wanna get down to business.
- Right?
- Fine.
We thought we'd start with these layouts.
Medicine.
Keeps the blood thin and running nicely through the veins.
Like my old Uncle Clyde used to say, never discuss business before lunch.
Well, we do have a standing 12:30 reservation at the Golden Spoon.
Well, meantime, no sense letting the old blood thicken up on us, huh?
Thank you.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Needs a little something.
Oh, yes!
"Don't be timid.
Push it.
Work with it.
Get to know your clay".
Hi, clay.
I'm supposed to get to know you.
Samantha!
What are you doing?
I'm sculpting, mortal-style.
Oh, how repulsive.
That's like Picasso painting with his feet.
It's going to be a bust of Darrin.
A bust of Durwood?
He's already a bust.
Mother, you're a laugh riot.
All right, gentlemen, let's get down to business, huh?
Now, Campbell Sporting Goods is very much in need of an image change and I think that McMann & Tate is just the firm that can do it.
Now, let's hear it.
How do you think you can help my company's public image?
Mr. Campaign, our campbell.
Don't we think somebody ought to order lunch?
Good idea.
Let's run it up the flagpole and see if anybody salutes.
You guys have already had 10 or 12 olives.
That's enough lunch for anybody.
Let's get down to business, huh?
I want to hear the entire campaign concept.
- Now, how does it go?
- I'm not sure.
Larry, sing a few bars.
Boy, 10 or 12 martinis and you guys are wiped out.
What has happened to the men of America?
I think we're going downhill.
I think it's too late for lunch.
We'd better get back to the office.
Right.
Right.
Good thinking.
Okay, okay.
Go ahead.
Now, look, it's 4:00.
I'll meet you back here at 6:00 for cocktails.
I'll be right here.
Cocktails?
Why don't we make it dinner?
At Darrin's place.
- At my place?
- That's very gracious of you, Darrin.
Sam?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi!
Did I call you about dinner tonight?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
Well, I should have, because Larry and a very important client are coming to dinner tonight.
I couldn't get out of it.
Your eyes are pink.
Make that red.
Honey, I had a very liquid afternoon with Mr. W.R. Campbell.
He's the first 90-proof client we've ever had.
Honey, do you mind pulling together dinner for two more?
I have an hour or so, so I can manage.
As long as you're slightly anesthetized this may be a good time to show you my artwork.
Boy, I really need a nap.
Yes.
Well, come on.
There.
Nice.
It's got a lot of texture!
Know who it is?
It's It's you.
That's me?
Well, it's sort of an impressionistic work.
Sort of.
- You hate it.
- Well Don't let it bother you, Samantha.
He would know a Rodin from a hot rock.
Speaking of rocks, how's chances of you climbing back under yours?
How would you like to be a carrot growing in a field of rabbits?
Darrin, now, please.
Stop it, both of you.
What can you expect from a crotchety old bat who learned to read from the Dead Sea Scrolls?
Talk about my age, will he?
One of these days, Samantha you're going to find yourself married to a 170-pound warthog.
Now, Mother, he didn't really mean it.
He's just tired.
He's tired, all right.
You'll excuse me.
I have to get started on dinner.
Be good.
Sam!
- Sam!
- I'm coming, sweetheart.
What is it, Darrin?
Oh, my stars!
No!
Oh, your mother!
It seems there's been a sudden improvement here.
Well, you know what a perfectionist Mother is.
That's not the word I have for her.
- I'm getting rid of this.
- Out!
You clown!
That's all we need around here tonight.
A talking statue.
I hate to tell you this, but your mother is not only a witch she's warped!
How utterly, utterly charming of you.
Endora, may I make a respectful request?
Butt out.
Darrin.
Mother, this happens to be a very important evening for Darrin, you see, and I couldn't care less about the importance.
Samantha, dear, is that coq au vin I smell?
Yes, as a matter of fact, it is.
How thoughtful of you to prepare my favourite dish.
When do we dine?
We eat at 7:30!
You take your broom to a drive-in or something.
You're not invited.
That's all right, Samantha.
If this is the way Durwood thinks a mother-in-law should be treated he's in for a very interesting evening.
That must be Larry.
Let's not torture ourselves with a lot of good-byes, shall we, Endora?
Very well.
Boy, am I asking for it.
I think this is just the beginning of a very long evening.
Stay with me.
Come on.
Oh, boy, what a headache!
It's good Louise wasn't home to see me pass out under the coffee table.
Darrin made it all the way upstairs.
Oh.
Oh, hi, Endora!
Larry Tate.
- It's always nice to see you, Endora.
- Thank you.
I didn't know your mother-in-law was going to join us.
Neither did I. Mother just pops in from time to time.
Yes, I'm supposed to be in Paris in 20 minutes.
But it's going to be a little difficult fighting those headwinds.
Now, there's a sense of humour.
Darrin, that's a fantastic likeness of you.
Oh, it isn't that good.
You mean, you did this, Sam?
Samantha just started sculpting this morning.
You mean you finished this in one day?
If she wanted to, she could whip one up just like that.
- How about a drink?
- Fine.
Sam, when you get a moment, do you think you could do one of me?
- Oh, I don't - Of course she will.
As a matter of fact, she might have a little surprise around here for you.
I can't get over this.
Where'd your mother go?
Well I guess she went to Paris.
I'll get that.
I'll get you a drink, sweetheart.
Sam, I had no idea you had so much talent.
- I'm glad you made it, Mr. Campbell.
- Yeah, thanks, thanks.
Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Campbell, this is my wife, Samantha.
How do you do?
I'm sorry I'm a little late.
I had to attend a ribbon-cutting ceremony.
- Friend of mine opened a bar.
- Well, then I don't suppose you'd care for a drink, Mr. Campbell.
Oh, that's right, Mrs. Stephens.
Three or four, yes.
One?
Never.
- I'll get it.
- Them.
You can put them all in one glass, all four.
Right.
Well!
Why don't we all go and sit down to dinner?
Oh, before we do, I want Mr. Campbell to see this.
Samantha did this bust of Darrin in one day.
Now, that's a chrome-plated gas.
Where's the boy with the sauce?
Pardon me.
I hope everybody's hungry.
Dinner's ready.
No hassle.
We'll just take the spirits to the table.
It'll help break up all that chewing.
Let's just see if we can't add a dash more interest to Durwood's evening.
- We'll have brandy in the den, all right?
- Long as it's brandy we'll have it anyplace you choose.
- Darrin.
Look!
This is the surprise Endora was talking about.
Sam!
I never realized I had such a beautifully shaped head.
Thanks, Sam.
You little dickens!
Oh, it was sort of a party favour.
Mother helped.
Again.
Oh, yes.
It's amazing how much help we get around here from Sam's mother.
I would have done one of Mr. Campbell, but I didn't know what he looked like.
Sweetheart, can I see you in the kitchen for a minute?
- I'll watch that for you.
- Oh.
Thank you.
Honey.
You know something, Campbell?
This thing looks like it could talk.
How do you do?
How about a shot of that brandy?
Right.
Right.
Mother?
Mother?
Darrin's willing to apologise.
Mother?
Maybe I'd better go see what's happening in the other room.
You keep trying.
I think I'll put me where the light's better.
Easy does it, fella.
Darrin, got this statue wired for sound, huh?
Why?
Did you hear something?
Yeah, why?
Did you hear something?
Can't you guys take a joke?
Why don't we have our brandy in the den?
Yeah.
Why don't we have our brandy in the den.
I think it's very impolite of them to leave you out of that meeting, gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Sam made a set of those for each room.
Larry, why don't you put that right there?
Sit down, Mr. Campbell.
Larry.
Can I freshen your Lar?
Oh, well.
Now, I think we can bring W.R. Campbell Sporting Goods into every home in America.
Here's the number one layout we had in mind.
Mr. Campbell?
Yeah.
Good!
Good!
Thank you.
Now, here we see the impact of sports on the youth.
Campbell Sports, of course.
You ought to see an allergist.
Lifelike, aren't they?
Larry, would you like a little spot of No!
No, thank you.
Now, here's the layout we'd use for use in trade magazines to open up new avenues in the direction of sales to colleges pro football teams, et cetera, et cetera.
- Mr. Campbell?
- Fine!
Mother, Darrin's suffered enough!
Mother.
One of these days.
Pow!
Here we see every item in W.R. Campbell's line.
Which will wear out at the drop of a hat.
You couldn't have said what I thought you said.
No, no.
He couldn't have said that.
It's all a mirage brought on by the booze.
Mr. Campbell, you don't hear a mirage.
You see a mirage.
I am seeing and hearing, both.
Those two lumps of rock are talking.
Do you know what he's talking about?
Nope.
They're not talking, huh?
Okay.
- Darrin.
- Mr. Campbell let's try to stay with the business at hand, shall we?
Now, If you'll just let me show you this next layout we can convince you that McMann & Tate are the logical choice to bring your company exactly what you need.
Speaking of that, why don't you bring me a salami sandwich?
Me too.
Heavy on the mayo.
That does it!
No more business talk.
- I'm getting out of here.
- What about the account?
You got it.
Give me something to sign.
I've got a contract here.
- Now, let's have a drink to this.
- Oh, never again!
Boy, when you go from pink elephants to talking rocks it's time to quit.
How do you spell "Campbell"?
Sam!
Sam, Mr. Campbell's leaving.
And we made our deal.
Good night, Mr. Campbell.
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
This has been the weirdest evening I've ever had.
Come on, Tate.
- Would you mind pouring me home?
- Glad to.
Good night, Sam, Darrin.
Good night, Larry.
We'll be talking to you in the morning, Mr. Campbell.
- Afternoon.
- Fine.
Oh, congratulations.
Was someone looking for me?
Now she shows up!
Mother, I know you think you made a shambles of this evening but it turned out just fine.
Mr. Campbell signed the contract, and Darrin has the account.
As a matter of fact, if it hadn't been for you we may not have gotten the account at all.
Worth a couple of million in billings.
You certainly know how to disgust a person.
Well, well, just another run-of-the-mill day in the life of the Stephenses.
Hey!
How about that salami sandwich?
Heavy on the mayo!
Mother!
Mother dear!
I think you forgot something.
Mother, come back here!
Oh, good grief.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
I'm coming.
- You the lady of the house?
- Yes.
Well, if you don't mind, you're some looker.
I mean, most housewives that open the door look like they ought to be riding brooms instead of sweeping with them.
Careful.
Some of my best friends are witches.
If you've come about magazines we already take more than we have time for.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
You see, it's about my trip to Europe.
You see, I just have to win And the way to win more points is to sell subscriptions, right?
Well, if you wanna put it that way.
You said it wasn't about magazines.
It's not.
It's about subscriptions.
That's probably someone offering me an absolutely free dance course which I can have for only 24 easy payments.
Hello?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
I miss you too.
You in Boston already?
It seems we just put you on the plane.
Everything all right?
You left what where?
A manila envelope on the front seat of the car, marked "Strothers account".
Yeah, I'll get them to you in no time.
Of course, in a plane, sweetheart.
Yes.
I promise.
Bye-bye.
Hey.
Since your hubby's out of town what do you say me and you go out on it tonight?
I'd love to.
What time do you wanna pick me up, honey?
Victoria, I want you to come down here this instant.
Do be a good girl and come along.
- Hello, Miss Parsons.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Stephens.
Are you having trouble with Victoria again?
It's just she's so dreadfully good about getting up trees and so dreadfully bad about getting down.
Victoria.
Clever girl.
You learned to do it.
Yes.
Hi, there.
Gracious.
Where did you come from?
The stork brought me?
Serena.
Miss Parsons, this is my cousin, Serena.
- Where did she come from?
- The cabbage patch.
Now don't you pay any attention to her.
She's a real kook.
But she wasn't there, and then suddenly she was.
Now, you know that's impossible, Miss Parsons.
Your eyes must have played a trick on you.
Wanna see me do it again?
- Here I am.
- Oh, dear.
- Serena.
- Well, what do you expect of a kook?
It must be because I haven't been taking my nerve medicine regularly.
Yeah, that must be it.
Miss Parsons, why don't you run home and fix yourself a nice pot of hot tea?
Yeah.
Yes, I guess I'll do that.
Goodbye, Mrs. Stephens.
Good grief, Serena.
What a priceless antique.
Where did you get her?
Don't you make fun of her.
She's one of our nicest neighbours.
You've got to be kidding.
No, I am not kidding.
I admire Miss Parsons.
- For what?
- For her good, kind heart.
She can't even turn away a stray cat.
How devastatingly dull.
Which reminds me, how long will Darrin be gone?
How did you know he was away?
I heard it on the wind.
Good news travels fast.
You're not the only one around here who can turn people into artichokes.
Before we can have our visit, I have to get this to Darrin.
Well, give it to me.
I'll zap it right into his hand.
No zapping.
I promised.
How much longer do you want the princess to sleep?
- About an hour.
- So be it.
By that hourglass.
Swell.
I don't suppose you could have just turned it over?
Manual labour with a talent like mine?
Never.
Serena, please promise me.
While I'm gone, no more horsing around.
I'll promise something better.
I'll tidy up the place for you while you're gone.
Just read a good book.
I love it, Samantha.
And don't let anybody tell you that colour isn't becoming.
Did you do the dye job all by yourself?
This happens to be my natural colour.
Darrin never told me you were a bleached blonde.
Perhaps he didn't think it was any of your business, whoever you may be.
Samantha, what's gotten into you?
I'm not Samantha.
I'm her cousin, Serena.
How do you do.
I'm Samantha's mother-in-law.
I've come to keep her company.
Well, she's out on an errand.
A long errand.
I'll tell her you dropped by.
Why don't I just come in and wait?
I don't expect her back for hours.
Good.
That'll give us time for a nice long chat.
We see so little of Samantha's relatives.
Tell me, are you a cousin on her mother's side or her father's?
- Her father's.
- That's interesting.
We've never even met him.
I mean, we don't even know what he does.
Does?
Nothing.
He basks.
Well, how nice for him.
How did he make his money?
In the basement.
How amusing.
I'm beginning to find you pretty amusing too, sweetie.
- Can I take your things?
- Thank you.
- Where's little Tabitha?
- Upstairs.
I think I'll go up and say hello.
Not now, if you don't mind.
She still has some time to go on her nap.
I was just noticing that's - That's a rather unusual hourglass.
- It is?
Yes.
I don't think I've ever seen one quite like it before.
Well, Samantha's always had unusual taste.
In people too.
Darrin, for instance, is extremely unusual.
Why, thank you, Serena.
And speaking of unusual people, we have met Samantha's mother.
She's a very sweet person.
I wouldn't say that to her face.
Speaking of her face, and just between us don't you think her makeup is a tiny bit overdone for a woman her age?
I mean, she must be at least She admits to a thousand.
I deserved that.
What's so different is that the sand goes up.
It's supposed to go down.
- Really?
- The law of gravity.
Does it make you nervous, Mrs. Stephens?
Well, if you want the truth, very.
Would you like me to stop it?
If you would.
Better?
No, I think it's worse.
How about some nice, reassuring sherry?
That would be nice.
Right behind you.
Help yourself.
I imagine Samantha keeps a little sherry on hand for her Uncle Arthur.
Why would you think that?
Don't misunderstand, Serena.
I think Samantha's Uncle Arthur has a marvellous sense of humour.
It's just that his His practical jokes are sometimes so unexpected.
Don't you think perhaps he nips it up a bit?
- Occasionally.
- Only when he needs reassuring.
That's what I meant.
Perhaps if you covered it.
It's not dead, Mrs. Stephens.
Besides, I'm timing Tabitha's nap.
- I worry about that child.
- Tabitha?
I can be honest with you, can't I?
Please do.
Well, Samantha wants to keep this baby all to herself.
Of course, I wouldn't dream of saying it to Samantha but she's being very selfish.
And perhaps someone other than her mother-in-law should advise her.
- For her own good?
- Of course.
And for Tabitha's.
Why, it would break my heart to see that darling child follow her mother's example and grow up to be selfish.
That rips it.
Meow, meow yourself.
Samantha would never forgive me if I left Tabitha alone.
Maybe some nice dog will find her.
Stop that.
Stop that, you bad dog.
Leave that kitty alone.
Leave her alone, now.
I'm coming, dear.
Go on.
Go on!
Go.
You poor, sweet little kitty.
That's a good girl.
Well, You do talk, don't you?
Well, maybe a nice saucer of warm milk will help calm you.
Come on.
Serena.
Serena, what are you trying to do?
Deafen the entire neighbourhood?
I haven't heard any complaints.
Well, who can hear anything over that?
- How's Tabitha?
- Fine.
She's upstairs.
So let's have some coffee.
And I will fill you in on what's been going on in our world.
Endora is playing duets on the sitar with Ravi and she's practically taken over the guru.
He refuses to meditate with anyone else.
- Someone was here.
- Really?
Who was it?
Serena, stop stalling.
Who was it?
Oh, yes, your mother-in-law.
How could I possibly forget her?
- She left without her purse?
- Apparently.
Well, I'll call her at home and tell her it's here, so she won't worry.
- She's not home.
- Where is she?
Now, that is a good question.
But I have a better one.
Why not ask what is she?
Because I'm terrified to.
You're going to be thrilled.
I turned her into a cat.
- You what?
- A common alley cat.
Serena, how could you?
Because she had her catty claws into all of us, including dear Uncle Arthur whom she practically accused of being a tosspot.
No, no, don't thank me.
It was a pleasure.
Thanking you isn't exactly what I have in mind.
You should have heard what she had to say about you.
I don't care what she What did she say?
I thought you didn't care.
I don't.
Where is she?
- Who cares?
- I do.
- You're joshing.
- And she has a husband at home.
Not often, I'm sure.
Serena, for the last time, where is she?
I don't know where she is.
The last I saw, she ran out into the patio and behind the fence.
- I'm going to look for her.
- What a pity.
We won't be able to have our little visit.
That's right.
You're gonna stay right here and wait.
I'm gonna find Mrs. Stephens, you're gonna turn her back.
And then, you are going to blow out of here.
Oh, Sammy.
You used to be such fun before you caught mortalitis.
Mrs. Stephens?
Mrs. Stephens?
Oh, Mrs. Stephens.
Here's the combination for you.
A year of Liberty and two of Collier's.
And all for only ten dollars.
Mrs. Stephens.
Mrs. Stephens.
Mrs. Stephens?
Mrs. Stephens?
Samantha.
Are you looking for someone?
Well, you might say so.
May I come in?
Is your cousin with you?
- No.
- Oh, then, of course.
- What came over him?
- Well, I haven't the faintest idea.
I was helping him win points by subscribing to Liberty and Collier's.
I wouldn't feel sorry for him.
Those magazines haven't been published for years.
Oh, my goodness.
Miss Parsons, we have recently acquired a pet cat.
- Oh, lovely.
- Yes.
Well, it isn't too lovely at the moment.
You see, she ran away.
Maybe she'd turned up here.
Well, as a matter of fact, a stray did turn up here a while back.
- Oh, good.
- Yes.
Which one is she?
Well, I can't really tell.
They look so much alike.
She meowed a lot when she first arrived.
That would be the one.
I'm surprised you don't know your own pet.
Yes.
Well, as I said I haven't had her very long, and she's sort of a gadabout so I haven't seen much of her.
- Maybe she'd come if I called.
- Yes.
Mrs. Stephens.
- Mrs. Stephens?
- That's an odd name for a cat.
Tabitha named her.
After her grandmother.
Mrs. Stephens?
Mrs. Stephens, where are you?
- Hi.
- I don't know what to mention first.
Your new hair, or the remote control on the door.
I approve of both.
You're not so bad yourself.
Well, thank you.
I came here to pick up Phyllis.
- Phyllis?
- Yes.
My wife.
Your mother-in-law.
- You're her husband.
- She asked me to pick her up at 5.
Tell me, would you miss her if she sort of got lost?
- Samantha, what are you talking about?
- I'm Serena, Samantha's cousin.
And I'm afraid that I like to horse around sometimes.
Like now.
She's obviously not gonna cooperate.
Well, cats can be difficult at times.
Cats and cousins.
Excuse me.
That's the back door.
Yes.
Certainly.
Mrs. Stephens stays a cat The rest of you are pups, lik e that Dear, this has been a day.
This morning, I was seeing things.
Now I'm hearing things.
I wonder when the dizzy spells start.
What barks be gone And don't come back Instead of cats we'll have no lack I could have sworn I heard barking.
- It must have been outside.
- It sounded so close.
Oh, I see you found Mrs. Stephens.
- Yes.
Thank you for taking her in.
- My pleasure.
- She can keep her little bell.
- Thank you again.
It's to warn the birds.
Miss Parsons, you seem rather nervous.
Are you all right?
Yes, dear.
I think so.
But I don't ever remember having a more bewildering day.
Oh, well, they happen to all of us.
Try not to think about it.
Mr. Stephens, I didn't expect What a pleasant surprise.
I came by to pick up Phyllis.
Well, she stopped to admire the garden next door.
Nothing personal, but I'm allergic to you.
Then you will get rid of her, won't you, Serena?
Reluctantly, coz, reluctantly.
I do hate to undo such a good deed.
My, that sherry was strong.
Oh, is it 5:00 already?
It's about half past.
My, this afternoon has gone by quickly.
Oh, dear, I'd forgotten about that.
Frank, will you come and look at this?
Did you ever see such an unusual hourglass?
No, I never have.
It's enormous.
Is anybody else warm?
Phyllis, what is that around your neck?
It's my bell, to warn the birds.
- Your bell to warn the birds?
- Did I say that?
It looks just like the one the cat had on.
- What cat?
- The one who was here when you stopped to admire the garden next door.
Garden next door?
Would you like some of Uncle Arthur's sherry?
Yes, I think I would.
- I'll pour it for you.
- Thank you.
My, it's nice to know there's a tosspot on Darrin's side of the family.
Evens things out so nicely.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Put your trust In Aunt Sue's cak e mix You will find it's not a fak e mix It will mak e a better batter And it weighs lighter than fatter It will make your batter better and it weighs lighter than a "fedder".
Oh, that's terrible.
Okay, who's the wise witch?
Hi, little cousin.
You made it sound so yummy.
Serena, how long have you been here?
And put that piece of cake back.
I just arrived.
You can have your silly old cake back.
Calories will kill my figure.
Hey, coz, where's gorgeous?
Darrin's away on a business trip.
I meant Tabitha.
Napping.
What have you been up to?
Well, I've been in Kenya on safari.
Tell me, how do you love it?
And tomorrow I'm off to Balmoral with Elizabeth and Philip.
And on the weekend, I'm expected in Athens for a yacht christening.
- Sounds like fun.
- I'm bored with fun.
It's the kind of life that makes you happy.
There must be something more to life than happiness.
Well, there's heartache.
Oh, I'd just love to have an aching heart for a change.
Like you.
Who's aching?
Well, the role of the grubby little housewife can't be all fun.
Like now.
Superboob is out of town.
That makes you unhappy.
Admit it.
I guess so.
Cousin do you know what I'm going to do?
- No.
I'm going to find myself a mortal and marry it.
- You know what I think?
- What?
I think you've cracked your cauldron.
Well, works for you.
Why do you think you're the only witch who can dig the mortal scene?
Darrin and I are special.
I'm pretty special myself, coz.
Serena, if you're really serious about getting married you have to find yourself a single man.
Okay, spoilsport.
Where?
Serena, you know what's available among the warlocks.
Warlock?
What kind of a challenge is a warlock?
I want a regular, dreary-type human being.
You couldn't get along with a human being.
- You get along with Darrin.
- But it takes work.
He's that difficult to live with, huh?
That's not what I meant.
Where do I look?
Oh, I don't know.
A church picnic, the beach, country club.
The Human Equation.
What was that last thing you said?
Human Equation.
It's a matchmaking service, sort of a cupid computer.
I saw it advertised on television.
How does it work?
Well, you see, they have this machine and you tell it what kind of man you want and And a man pops out of the machine?
No.
A card pops out that matches your card.
And our cards live happily ever after.
Sounds sexy.
For the cards.
- Forget it.
- No.
I dig that science-fiction jazz.
- Let's split.
- I'd rather not get involved, Serena.
Okay.
Okay.
But if you don't come with me l'm going to tell dumbo all about you and Sir Walter Raleigh.
I never even met Sir Walter Raleigh.
I know it, and you know it.
But will he believe it?
That's liar's blackmail.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Man, it really works.
It's the only way to travel.
Altar-wise, that is.
Well, I have a happy surprise for you.
Because there are two, you qualify for the group rate.
Marvy-poo.
We're cousins, and I'm married.
Well, now let's see what we can do for you happiness-wise.
Groovy-wise.
If you'll just fill out this questionnaire, dear.
Neatness and truth count.
Sit here, please.
I'll leave you alone a minute.
"Name".
Well, I don't need any help with that.
"Age".
If I told them the truth, the computer would have a nervous breakdown.
- You look 26.
- I look 22.
- Well, actually - Twenty-six.
"Who is your favourite political figure"?
Oh, that's easy.
Julius Caesar.
They mean today.
I still think Julie is cuter than Dickie.
This is always an exciting moment for me.
Now, your card will be injected into this slot.
These cards represent our male clientele.
When I turn on the computer those male cards that are compatible with your female card will drop into your little slot.
How romantic.
Shall we give it a whirl?
- Nothing's dropping into my slot.
- Now, give it time, my dear.
- What's the matter with those cards?
- Patience, my dear.
Patience.
- I made it!
- Amazing.
Why, you must be an extraordinary girl to attract only one card.
You can believe that.
You lucky, lucky, lucky girl.
This match was surely made in heaven.
- Who is he?
- That's top-secret for now.
Please wait in the outer office while I try to arrange for a meeting.
You have a luncheon date tomorrow at 1 with your intended at the Rotisserie.
- Congratulations.
- Wait Wait a minute.
Who is he?
His name is Franklyn Blodgett.
That's all you need to know.
What does he look like?
Where does he come from?
- What does he do for a living?
- Dear child, if I tell you every goody what will you two lovebirds have to talk about?
We'll think of something.
Oh, yeah.
Monsieur Blodgett.
The wine you ordered, Monsieur Blodgett.
I've known you for ages in here.
The wine you ordered, sir.
The wine that you would drink.
What is your favourite wine?
Lafite Rothschild, 1923.
Château Lafite Rothschild, 1923.
Wow, that's some computer.
Franklyn, would you excuse me for just a moment?
I'd like to freshen up a little.
Yes, of course.
- But hurry back.
- Oh, yes.
- Hello.
- Sammy, I'm in love.
You just met him, and you're in love?
Oh, it wasn't a meeting.
It was two stars exploding in the galaxy.
You're in love.
What does he look like?
Where does he come from?
What does he do for a living?
Oh, I can't be bothered with technicalities.
He knows my favourite wine.
Oh, well, now, that's what I call a basis for a good, solid My lucky day.
Serena, please listen to me.
You don't get married for kicks.
Sammy, I could have eaten lunch right through dinner.
He is beautiful.
So's a cobra.
Is he intelligent?
Intelligent?
He's read books that haven't even been written yet.
My, what a stimulating companion.
He'll read while you rot.
I'm not going to tell you any more about him.
- Good.
- I've invited him for dinner so why don't you go to a movie or something?
No, I think I'd better stay around here and help.
I don't need any help.
That's what you think.
Let's see.
First, I think I'll start off with some pâté.
Then salad: Hearts of palm, vinaigrette.
And for the main course: Chateaubriand.
Lovely.
What's the matter?
Chateaubriand too well-done?
Everything's too well-done.
Come with me.
Here are the recipes.
There is the food.
Here's the heat.
Now start cooking.
Me?
I don't even know how to boil water.
You're not serving boiled water for dinner.
Oh, come on, cousin.
Let me whip up a little gourmet meal.
If you're gonna marry a mortal, you'll have to learn to live like one.
Who made up that rule?
Believe me, I'm an authority on the subject.
Mortals are uncomfortable with perfection.
They just love helpless women.
So a little imperfection in your dinner and you can only endear you to him.
Oh, cousin, that doesn't even make sense.
Well, maybe not, but that's the way it is.
Okay.
Okay.
How do I look, Pop?
Smashing.
You don't make it sound like a compliment.
It is for our kind, but you're dealing with a mortal.
A frailty here and there might help your cause.
But I don't have any frailties, Pop.
Pretend.
Roughen up those smooth edges.
Mortal women find clumsiness quite endearing.
Clumsiness.
So long, Pop.
The Warlock Club, Macduff.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What are you hiding?
Just a little bunch of violets.
- How quaint.
I'm afraid they're a little wilted.
Like me.
Oh, I like the way you look, Serena.
You're so human.
That's the nicest thing anyone ever said to me.
Come in.
- It's so clumsy of me.
- Yes.
Tough, huh?
No.
No, not all.
It's so delicious I wanna relish its flavour as long as I can.
Oh, you're just being kind.
Oh, yes, yes.
- Would you care for more gravy?
- Yes.
I'm terribly sorry.
It was so clumsy of me.
Don't apologise.
It's only human.
Let me help.
- Oh, I did the same thing.
- That could happen to anyone.
It's been a perfect evening, Serena.
I'm sorry about your thumb.
Well, I'll know better next time.
"Close cover before striking match".
Anyway, thanks for the first aid.
And may I see you again tomorrow night?
Golly whiz.
Two nights in a row?
Please, Serena.
There's something I wanna talk to you about.
Talk.
I will sleep on it and save it for tomorrow.
Please?
Shall we say 8:00?
Good night.
Good night.
Samantha!
Samantha!
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Isn't he the living, clumsy, beautiful, mortal end?
Especially the clumsy part.
I peeked through the staircase.
Oh, I've never known anything like him.
It's so refreshing.
I think he's going to propose.
Congratulations.
Now comes the hard part.
- What?
- When you tell him you're a witch.
I'll tell him.
I'll tell him.
My boy, if she really loves you, it won't matter.
I can't just come right out and tell her I'm a warlock.
You'll find a way of breaking it to her gently.
Lovely.
Well, here's to What shall we drink to?
How about truth?
You took the word right out of my mouth.
Truth.
And speaking of truth, how do you feel about it?
I think it's a virtue.
Sometimes.
Exactly.
Take me, for example.
Now, there are times when I can be an awful little witch.
Well, all women can.
But the important thing is that people like each other in spite of their shortcomings.
Exactly.
Yes.
May I tell you something about my?
- Sorry.
You first.
- Sorry.
You first.
Could we go inside?
It's rather chilly out here.
Well, yes, of course.
Thank you.
This is such a warm, human kind of room.
Why do you use the word "human" so much?
It's as if you were hung up on the human race.
I mean, there are other things besides humans.
There are birds and vegetables bees.
There are lots of other things.
Yes, you're quite right.
Franklyn, look at me.
Don't take your eyes off me.
I wouldn't if I could.
Want to bet?
- I'm here.
- Whe?
Get it?
- Now do you get it?
- Get it?
I've had it.
Oh, Franklyn, please, no.
No, no.
Please don't go.
I mean, I'm not really a witch.
I mean, I'm not a witch all the time.
Most of the time, I'm just a simple, sweet Yes.
Explanations aren't necessary.
- Then you do understand.
- Understand?
Now do you understand?
Oh, no.
- Oh, isn't it ironic?
- Yeah.
You were looking for the same thing that I was looking for.
- Yes.
- Yes.
But on the other hand is my being a, you know, awfully important?
It really doesn't matter.
You and I have so much in common.
Oh, so true.
And when you come right down to it, maybe it's better this way.
I mean, we won't have the usual adjustment problems that most people have.
- Well, some adjustments.
- Like what, for instance?
Well, if you'll take it in the manner in which it's offered I'm all ears.
I mean, It could have been simply due to nervousness.
Would you get to the point?
Well, it's this business: In the social circle in which I travel that would be considered rather gauche.
I beg your pardon?
Well, now you're angry, and I was only trying to be helpful.
Go on.
Observe.
You see?
Style, subtlety.
None of this waving of one's arms about like a demented windmill.
Now, look here, buster, you take that back.
If you can't take constructive criticism "Demented windmill"?
You call that constructive criticism?
Well, let me tell you, you road-company Cary Grant.
I can out-subtle you from now until doomsday.
- Really?
- Really.
- Thank you for the champagne.
- Oh, you're welcome.
I do hope you didn't find it too gauche.
Not at all.
Would you care for some?
Delighted.
Chicken!
Serena.
Chicken.
Serena, why not leave bad enough alone?
Because Grandma taught us, "If at first you don't succeed, give up".
Never liked Grandma.
You're going to be very pleased, my dear.
Hear what the man said?
That's also what Mr. Beams of The Human Equation said.
I have here the card of a gentleman.
And his name is Franklyn Blodgett.
No, his name is Ted Perkins.
Now, if you ladies will wait in the outer office l'll try to arrange the meeting.
Mr. Perkins?
Mr. Lovelace here.
Oh, indeed I have, Mr. Perkins, and she's lovely.
Mr. Perkins, no criticism intended but would you please try to repress that irrepressible sense of humour of yours?
Mr. Perkins, please.
Please.
Thank you, Mr. Perkins.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Okay, Tabitha.
It's almost time for your lunch.
Let's go.
Okay, but just 10 more swings?
No, sweetheart.
I have so many things to do.
Daddy's coming home from Canada this afternoon.
- Ten is too many.
- Nine more?
Tabitha, life is not one big swing.
- But, Mommy - No buts.
Five.
That's my final offer.
One.
You stay right here, Bonzo.
I'm gonna give it a running start.
Hurry up, Tabitha.
Mommy, I only have little legs.
For me, this is hurrying.
That's right, sweetheart.
Well - Mommy, is that cake for me?
- No.
We're gonna have a welcome-home party for Daddy.
With cake and candles?
Sure!
Two.
One for each day he's been gone.
Daddy, Daddy.
No, no, sweetheart.
That's not Daddy.
He's not coming home till late this afternoon.
Hi, there.
Where did you come from?
Monkey, monkey.
I wanna play with the monkey.
Come here, you silly little thing.
He's probably lost.
Maybe he's trying to tell us where he lives.
Yeah, well, sorry, old man, but I can't quite understand you.
I wanna play with the monkey.
You finish your lunch, young lady, and after your nap, we'll take him home.
Wherever that is.
No doubt about it.
You are a monkey with a problem.
Okay, fella.
Come on down from there, and let's see.
Oh, well, I guess you're not getting my message.
I'm certainly not getting yours.
So let's just make this easy on both of us.
A monk ey you are A monk ey you'll be In human form When I count to three One, two, three Oh, there.
That's better.
Sure is, lady.
A lot better.
You'll never know how much.
Well, I don't know.
I thought you were a cute little monkey.
I'm not a monkey.
I'm a chimpanzee.
Well, I'm sorry, but they are the same family.
People do get them confused.
Well, I don't know why they should.
Do they confuse a shark with a goldfish or a lion with a pussycat?
Yes, well If you just tell me where you live and who you belong to, I'll take you home.
No, you won't.
I'm not going back to that little boy.
Poor fella's probably crying his eyes out for you right now.
The kid's a brat!
He cares more about his kite than he does about me.
When I take you home, I'll talk to him about that.
- No, you won't.
- Why not?
I've waited a long time for my chance to be a man.
The point is, you are not a man.
And you can't remain a man, not even for one day.
Think of it this way.
I'm almost a man already.
I just missed it on the evolutionary ladder by one rung.
Now how would you feel?
That's life.
Think of the poor fella who invented 6-Up.
Oh, boy.
I had to pick a funny witch.
You have one human quality already.
You're a wise guy.
I'm wise all right.
Wiser than most people.
How many people in that park today knew you were a witch?
Oh, my stars.
Don't be stubborn about this.
Okay.
Okay.
You have a choice.
Back home or to the zoo.
How you like them bananas?
- Yes?
- Mr. Tate?
Miss Tuck er and Mr. Flynn are here to see you.
All right, show them in.
- Mr. Tate.
- Miss Tucker, good to see you again.
Mr. Flynn.
I thought that Well, wasn't your appointment for tomorrow?
Well, Bobby, here, came up with an idea that couldn't wait until tomorrow.
Darrin Stephens is your account executive and I'd prefer he be here for - We don't need your Mr. Stephens.
- Go ahead, Bobby.
- Right.
First, the models.
Models?
Now just picture this.
A TV commercial and these magnificent specimens walk on the screen.
Now, the pitch is to the ladies.
To bring out the best in your beast, give him Brawn Cologne!
That's really But, of course, once you get the music, it'll Mr. Stephens and I will give this some thought.
Remarkable the way they get those things to pop.
Those things are called pectorals.
It's remarkable anyway.
Miss Tucker, will you step over here, please?
Miss Tucker, you owe it to yourself to listen to Stephens's ideas.
We don't want to rush into anything.
You've been talking about Darrin Stephens for days.
I'm beginning to think he's a figment of your imagination.
Darrin has been in Canada on business.
He'll be back this afternoon.
And we'll see him first thing in the morning.
We'll see him today or not at all.
Good idea.
We'll go over to Darrin's house right now and catch him the minute he gets in.
Oh, come on.
Be a good sport.
Tell me where you live.
Let me put it this way.
Either you tell me your address, or I'll change you back, anyhow.
Then you'll never find out, will you?
Okay.
Game time is over.
A chimp you once were A Mother!
Aren't you going to introduce me to your gentleman-friend?
He is no friend, and he is no gentleman.
He's rather cute for a mortal.
Mother, he's an ape.
Most men are.
I'm a chimp.
If you're a chimp, I'm a monkey's uncle.
Two funny witches.
Fun and games are over.
A chimp you once were A chimp you will be Little and hairy when I count to Mommy, Mommy, I woke up.
- Saved by the baby.
- Not for long.
I'll deal with you later.
You're a regular little swinger, aren't you?
- Oh, Endora.
- Mr. Tate.
Oh, Miss Tucker, Mr. Flynn this is Darrin Stephens' mother-in-law, Mrs Endora.
- Do come in, please.
- Thank you.
- Is Darrin home yet?
- No, no, he isn't.
And the house is so empty without the dear boy.
- Where's Sam?
- She's upstairs with Tabitha.
Miss Tucker's the creator of Brawn Cologne for men.
And Darrin's the account executive.
Mr. Tate seems to think that Mr. Stephens is going to pull the perfect advertising campaign right out of his attaché case.
I'm very curious, Miss Tucker.
Why does a woman run a company that makes a man's cologne?
For money.
And there'll be plenty of that to go around once we get rolling.
Not if we don't find the perfect image for our product, there won't.
And the way things are going, I'm beginning to think - Who is that?
- His name?
It's Harry.
Harry Simian.
- Divine, isn't he?
- Oh, he certainly is.
You know what I'm thinking?
I'm thinking we've found our man.
Oh, he'd love to hear you say that.
Harry?
you go.
Turn around.
Oh, my.
You look very pretty for Daddy's homecoming party.
Now, you stay up here and colour and I'll get Grandmama to come up and see how pretty you look.
Okay, Mommy.
Oh, yes.
Yes, I feel that he's the perfect model for Brawn Cologne.
I'll set up the gallery in the morning for some pictures.
And if it works out how about a long-term contract?
The longer the better.
Hi, Larry.
What a surprise.
Oh, hi, Sam.
This is Evelyn Tucker and Mr. Flynn.
Samantha Stephens, Darrin's wife.
- How do you do?
- Hello.
Sorry to barge in on you like this, but Miss Tucker was very anxious to meet with Darrin on the account.
- He'll be home any minute.
- We don't need him anymore.
We just found the answer to our campaign.
Miss Tucker thinks that Darwin's cousin, Harry is the perfect image for her Brawn Cologne.
Well.
Harry is expected at home.
I mean, he has a little boy waiting for him at home.
Don't you, Harry?
- He'll keep.
- That's fine.
We'll see you at the office at nine.
Now, wait a minute, Larry.
Don't you think we ought to wait for Darrin to get home Well, I mean I mean, after all, Brawn Cologne is Darrin's account.
I am Brawn Cologne, and I'm satisfied.
We won't take up any more of your time, Sam.
Ask Darrin to call me when he comes in.
Goodbye, everybody.
Oh, good bye, Harry.
See you tomorrow.
I'll be there.
No, you won't.
Sam, we're talking about an $800000 account.
Now, if Harry isn't downtown bright and early tomorrow morning tell Darrin not to come in either.
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Right, Harry.
Bye, Endora; Sam.
Not a bad start for my first day as a man.
Yes, as I was saying.
A chimp you once were A chimp you will be Little and hairy When I count to three One, two, three Okay, come on.
You go out there and play.
While I think of something to tell Darrin.
Tell him the truth.
He's getting an $800000 account.
- He should be thrilled.
- He'll be furious.
He's never what he should be.
Hello?
Hi, sweetheart.
What a shame.
How much longer do you think you'll be stuck there?
Two days?
Oh, that's marvellous.
No, I mean, it's marvellous that you're doing so well there.
No.
No, no, don't call Larry.
I'll call him for you.
Everything's just fine here.
Sweetheart, you have fun and don't worry.
Good bye.
I'll do the worrying for both of us.
Here's Grandmama to baby-sit while you take your chimp off to work.
A monkey, posing for a man's cologne.
Where did I go wrong?
Look on the positive side, my darling.
Brawn has its image Harry has a crack at being human, and Durwood is a hero.
Now look on the negative side.
Harry is a chimp.
There's no telling what he can do.
He could ruin everything, and Larry will find some way to blame Darrin.
All right.
Wake up.
A monk ey you are A monk ey you'll be But in human form When I count to three One, two three Okay.
You're a man for a day.
That means nine to five.
What's the hurry?
They're gonna take pictures of you in an hour.
I'm not good for anything till I've had my morning coconut.
A star is born.
All right, hold it just like that, Harry.
That's it.
That's it.
Okay.
Bring that light in there.
All right, now pick the drink up, Harry.
That's it, that's it.
All right, now.
Now look sexy, Harry.
That's it.
Boy, that's good.
- Good, good.
- Is that all?
Oh, baby, we've just begun.
All right, now hit him with that spot.
Yeah, that's good.
Good.
Okay, Harry.
Now let's have some good action shots.
All right, you ready, Harry?
Okay, swing.
Hey, get down from there.
It's the tennis racket you're supposed to swing, dumb-dumb.
Who does he think he is, calling me a dumb-dumb?
Harry, you just relax.
You're doing fine.
I'll find out how much longer it'll be.
Just a few more shots.
This is the worst apple I've ever tasted.
- It's wax.
- Wax?
You humans have strange appetites.
All right, everybody.
Break's over.
Back to work.
Come on, my boy.
Let's get out there and pose.
Time is money.
Why so glum?
You did beautifully today.
It was harder than I thought.
Just the same, I must admit you made it as a man.
- Well, I don't want to be a man.
- Oh, boy.
I thought humans were complicated.
I didn't like it today.
I didn't like it at all.
All those humans cared about was work.
Nobody wanted to play.
You're not giving it a fair chance.
You asked for one full day.
- It's only half over.
- I've seen enough.
As a chimp, nobody pushed me around.
People didn't yell at me or call me dumb-dumb.
They patted me and fed me.
Well now that your pictures for Brawn are finished it's no problem changing you back.
Great!
Well, good bye, Samantha.
You're a queen among witches.
And you're a prince among chimps.
Oh, wait a minute.
I gotta give you the address of the kid who owns me.
Sweet little fella.
Probably crying his eyes out over me.
Hello?
- Oh, Hi, Larry.
- Sam, we rushed the pictures through and Harry is sensational.
Well, all's well that ends well.
Ends my foot!
This is only the beginning.
Evelyn and I have mapped out the whole campaign.
TV spots, personal appearances around the country; the works.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to get someone else, because Nonsense.
Harry's it.
He may be a little inexperienced, but he's got the mystique for the product.
Well, his mystique is a mistake.
You see, he doesn't want to Sam, will you let me worry about what he wants?
Just see to it he's down here at five 'o clock for the press conference.
And, Sam, lest we forget this is an $800000 account.
Well, that's unforgettable, all right.
Yeah, I got you, Larry.
Oh, Darrin, he'll be very pleased.
Bye.
Okay, you can change me back.
Harry, I'm afraid there's been a slight delay.
I don't want a slight delay.
I wanna be a chimp.
I know.
Yeah, I know.
But try to be patient.
Now No, you can't quit But you could be fired.
Fired?
How?
I'm too good.
Just act like the real you, that should do it.
- The real me?
- That's right.
Okay, Harry, baby.
Now let's have that look of distinction.
That's it.
Hold it.
Makeup, let's get that shine off of his nose.
He bit me, he bit me.
He actually bit me.
That's the animal in him.
Oh, perfect.
Miss Bond; Charlie.
Oh, I want you to meet some friends from the press.
Miss Bond editor of "Fashion Wear" magazine, and Charles Gilbert of "Sportswear Daily".
This is Brawn Cologne's man, Harry Simian.
I'm not Brawn's man.
You mean you don't like being Brawn's man?
He means that he's his own man.
That's not what I mean.
Guess again.
- Sam, what's he doing?
- Telling the truth.
- You wouldn't want him to lie.
- Of course I would.
Brawn's man, my foot.
You're Brawn's beast.
He didn't mean that.
Tell her you didn't mean that!
- I didn't mean that.
- I know.
What I really meant was this.
He's so playful.
I have never been so humiliated in my whole life.
- I know, I know.
Fire that man.
Get rid of him!
You're fired, right now!
Out!
Fine, fine!
Bravo, bravo!
What is so "bravo" about what that gorilla is doing?
Why don't you tell her, Larry?
Why don't you tell her, Sam?
Oh, well, yes, of course.
This whole thing was carefully staged to help kick off Darrin's new slogan.
"When your man uses Brawn Cologne there's no telling how wild he might get".
Did you know about this?
It all depends.
Well, I think it's sensational.
I knew about it.
Tate, I question your methods, but I approve the slogan.
Yes, we thought you'd like it.
And I also approve of the campaign, on one condition.
- What's that?
- That I never have to lay eyes on that ape again as long as I live.
Well, I think that can be arranged.
Look, Mommy, monkey.
That's not a monkey.
It's a chimp.
There's a big difference.
At least the chimps think so.
- Are they as smart as people?
- Some of them are smarter.
- What's his name?
- Bonzo.
Hello, Bonzo.
He was lost for a few days, but he's back now.
I'm sure if you love him and take very good care of him he'll never run away again.
- Say good bye, Tabitha.
- Good bye, Bonzo.
So long, Harry.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Samantha, the luncheon was delicious.
Thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
The omelette is your recipe.
Oh, that's why it's so good.
Mother.
Wh Where did she come from?
Oh, Mother just loves to pop in unexpectedly.
Yes.
I just flew in from Monaco.
But But she wasn't here a minute ago and And suddenly she was.
Now, now, now, Mrs. Stephens, you know that's impossible.
Perhaps your eyes are playing tricks on you.
Samantha, my dear, I was playing chemin de fer with the prince.
- How did you do?
- Not badly.
I won the palace.
Of course, I won't hold the prince to it.
Now, you two just go on talking about whatever it is you talk about.
I really came to see Tabitha.
I thought I'd take the little princess to the zoo.
- To the zoo?
- Oh, yes.
Tabitha and I spent a perfectly lovely day there last week.
Oh, you did.
How nice.
They They They They were there for half an hour, and I was with them.
Tabitha just loved the unicorn and the dodo bird.
There are no such things as unicorns and dodo birds.
We saw the usual things: Elephants and tigers and monkeys.
And a unicorn and a dodo bird.
Samantha, when can I have Tabitha for the day?
I think I'd like to take her to the museum.
Oh, I think she's a little too young for the museum.
But not for the zoo?
Right you are.
I knew you'd understand.
Oh, that's probably Frank, come to pick me up.
I have such a thoughtful husband.
Always so prompt.
And such a good honker.
Sorry you have to leave, Mrs. Stephens.
- She is tedious.
- Mother.
You know, the next time I go to Monaco I think I'll take her with me.
Maybe I can lose her.
Well, I finally got Tabitha down for her nap.
- Mother.
- Five minutes to place your wager.
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?
I'm sitting on a horse.
- I can see that.
But why?
- To give you a little preview.
I've decided to be the first woman jockey to ride at Aintree.
- Oh, splendid.
- These are the queen's silks.
Well, no disrespect to the queen but would you mind getting her silks and horse off my rug?
Oh, Samantha.
You're definitely no fun at all anymore.
I know.
Regular old stick-in-the-mud.
I'll count to three.
Don't bother.
Cream or lemon?
Cream, please.
Oh, you'll loosen up once we get to swinging London.
- London?
- Yes, the three of us.
With Durwood away for the weekend, it's an opportunity for Tabitha to visit all the fascinating relatives on our side of the family.
Well, Mother, I'm afraid that - Excuse me.
- You and Tabitha can visit your father in London, while I have cocktails with the queen mother.
Then I thought we'd catch up with Uncle Arthur in Marrakech and then on to Skorpios where I understand Serena is stirring up a bit of trouble.
- Mr. Stephens.
- Hi, Samantha.
Is Mrs. Stephens with you?
No, she thinks I'm out shopping.
- Come in.
- Oh, thank you.
Well what a pleasant surprise.
Phyllis didn't mention that you were here.
She probably likes to keep good news to herself.
Besides, she seemed a little unstrung when she left.
Yeah, well, she had a sick headache on the way home.
- That's what I want to talk about.
- Would you care for some tea?
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, allow me.
- Sit down.
- Samantha Phyllis has the idea that you're waging some sort of a campaign to keep her away from Tabitha.
Now, why would I do a thing like that?
Well, she feels it's because you think that she is senile and incompetent.
That's ridiculous.
Then why are you trying to keep them apart?
- I'm not.
- Well, I believe it but in order to convince Phyllis I'm going to ask you to do me a favour.
- Cream or lemon?
- Cream, thank you.
- You were going to ask me a favour?
- Yes.
But now, I think it's best if she thinks it's your idea.
What is the favour?
Well, now, in the first place, I realize that Tabitha is too young for museums.
- Good for you.
- So I'm going to suggest a compromise.
- Compromise?
- Yes.
How about letting Tabitha spend the weekend with us?
Well, I think one of these weekends it could be arranged.
- I had this weekend in mind.
- That sounds like a marvellous idea.
Gives mother and daughter a chance to be together.
Last month in Barcelona I met a matador you just wouldn't believe.
Then perhaps you would.
I just don't think that Tabitha is ready to spend a weekend away from home.
Nonsense, Samantha.
When you were 4, you were out watching fireworks in Tivoli Gardens.
Remember?
With your champagne and caviar snack?
- Mother.
- Oh, the modern generation just doesn't swing.
The point is, I'm afraid Tabitha's still at the "spilly" stage and you have so many beautiful things.
Oh, they're only things.
It isn't the spilling so much.
It's the sticky fingers.
Love sticky fingers.
So, is it okay?
Or are you gonna watch me float away on a sea of Phyllis' crocodile tears?
You're very persuasive.
- Then it's settled.
- Well, l Of course, Sam, I don't want you to feel you had no choice in the matter so what time would you like Tabitha picked up tomorrow?
How about after lunch?
Let's say, 5:30?
Let's say 1:00.
And now, remember, this whole thing is your idea.
Oh, well, I hate to hog all the credit, but if you insist.
Oh, well, I do insist.
So nice seeing you again.
Don't bother to see me out, dear.
Goodbye.
Boy, are you a big help.
Now all I have to do is figure a way out.
Why?
Most grandparents get to spend weekends with their grandchildren.
Most grandparents don't have grandchildren who can turn them into toads.
Say, that might be an improvement.
When can you be ready to leave for Barcelona?
- I can be ready at 1:00.
- Marvellous.
To go with Tabitha on her weekend with her mortal grandparents.
Oh, Samantha, you're an absolute drear.
I know.
I know.
- It's a fatal case.
- In which case, darling Tallyho!
All right now, Tabitha, when we get to your grandmother's house Will she make unicorns and dodo birds?
No, sweetheart.
Your other grandmother makes things like that.
This grandmother makes raisin cookies.
- I like raisin cookies.
- Good.
- Not as much as unicorns and dodos.
- As unicorns and dodos.
Tabitha, in this world, there are two different kinds of people.
- I know.
- You do?
There are big people and little people.
Yes, sweetheart, that's right.
- Oh, Mrs. Stephens.
- Am I early?
- Oh, just a bit.
- Oh, I must be fast.
Well, I see my little lamb is all ready.
So am I. - Oh, are you coming too?
- Lf you don't mind.
Oh, no.
No, no, of course not.
Mrs. Stephens, I don't mean to impose, it's just that Impose?
Lmpo Did I say impose?
- No.
- Come along.
I'll take my granddaughter.
You bring the bags.
Here we go.
"Here we go".
Samantha, what a pleasant surprise.
- I didn't know you were coming.
- Neither did I. - Hi, Grandpa.
- Hi, Tabitha.
- How's my big girl?
- Fine.
I didn't think it was fair to leave her with you for the entire weekend.
She's such a lively child.
So was Darrin, but I wasn't too incompetent to handle him.
Oh, well, that was years ago.
You might try being on my side once in a while.
Come along, darling.
- Here we go.
- Oh, Mrs. Stephens?
It's time for her nap.
Milk and cookies first.
Her nap later.
Why not visit with Frank, Samantha?
He'll tell you all about his latest invention.
I am going to make a fortune with this one.
Sam, sit down.
I'll tell you all about it.
Oh, we're going to have a wonderful weekend, Tabitha.
While you're visiting here you can do anything you want.
You mean things I'm not allowed to do at home I can do here?
- Of course.
It's a vending machine for the home.
Now, you press a button and, zingo out comes a martini.
You press another button, and, pow, an old-fashioned.
You press another button, and, pingo, a Tom Collins.
Wow, well, that's progress, all right.
No home should be without one.
Guess what Grandma has for you on the patio.
A surprise.
I'm Black Bart.
I'm Black Bart.
A bird that can talk.
Hello there, baby.
Did you make him so he can talk?
Everything that bird knows, he learned from me.
Frank, I have a sick headache.
Frank, I have a sick headache.
I'll get you some more cookies.
Hello there, baby.
- I'm Tabitha.
- I'm Black Bart.
- I know.
Is it fun being a bird?
- Frank, I have a sick headache.
- Is that all you can say?
- I'm Black Bart.
I wish you could talk better.
- Hello, Tabitha.
- Hi, Black Bart.
That's a dumb name.
Call me Mr. Marvellous.
Mr. Marvellous, is it fun being a bird?
- I can take it or leave it.
- Would you like to be an eagle?
In this stupid cage?
- Well - Frank!
Frank.
Oh, Frank.
Something is terribly wrong.
That bird is having a conversation with Tabitha.
Excuse me.
Well, of course they're having a conversation.
Isn't that why you taught the bird to talk?
Tabitha, did you do a no-no to this bird?
- Yes.
- Tabitha.
Grandma said I can do anything I want.
No one can give you permission to use witchcraft, except me.
- But you won't.
- That's right.
Now, you un-witch that bird, young lady.
Okay.
Be the way you were before.
I'm Black Bart.
Hello there, baby.
Frank, I have a sick headache.
Now, Frank, just Just listen to this.
Is it Is it fun being a bird, Mr. Marvellous?
I'm Black Bart.
Hello there, baby.
Well, that doesn't sound much like a conversation to me.
Frank, I swear to you If you'll excuse us, it's time for Tabitha's nap.
- Where shall I put her?
- Upstairs, the first door to the right.
Thank you.
And why don't you stretch out on the couch for a while?
I'm afraid you've been overdoing things lately.
Nonsense.
I never felt better.
Frank would you mind getting a tiny bit of sherry?
- Mr. Marvellous?
- I'm Black Bart.
I'm Black Bart.
I'm Black Bart.
I'm Black Bart.
Up from our nap so soon?
I would have gotten her.
You were so busy.
I didn't want to disturb you.
Can I have some more cookies?
- No, sweetheart.
No - Of course you can, darling.
One of these days, I do believe you're going to turn into a raisin cookie.
That would be fun, Mommy.
Hello, everybody.
I'm not going to ask where you came from.
I'll just assume that you came to take Samantha home.
No.
No, Mother just popped in to say hello.
Hello.
- Hello.
- How nice.
Here you are, darling.
Can Grandmama have a cookie too?
They're not by chance from an Alice B. Toklas recipe?
- They're my recipe.
- Then I think I'll pass.
Well, well, well.
- Where did you come from?
- Frank.
As long as you've asked, I just popped in from Liverpool where I was exercising my horse for the upcoming Grand National steeplechase at Aintree.
Oh, what a kidder.
- Yeah.
- Mother's just a laugh a minute.
- Now that we're all here, I have an idea.
- Oh, beginner's luck.
Samantha, your mother's a card.
Mrs. Stephens, maybe it would be better if Mother and I went home.
- Well, whatever for?
- Frank, never mind.
And took Tabitha with us.
- Whatever for?
- Well, l I just remembered that Tabitha prefers to sleep in her own little bed.
How do you know?
Has she ever spent a night away from home?
A night I know nothing about?
Oh, Phyllis, I think what Samantha is trying to say I know what Samantha's trying to say.
She wants to take Tabitha home because she thinks I'm senile.
Mrs. Stephens, I didn't say you were senile.
That's what you meant when you said she prefers sleeping in her own bed.
- I did?
- Of course you did.
Phyllis, Samantha didn't say it, you did.
- I'll bring Tabitha over some other time.
- When she's older.
Frank, I'm getting a sick headache.
Frank, I'm getting a sick headache.
Well, I am!
You do understand, don't you, Mr Stephens?
- Well, not exactly.
- He's trying.
Well, come along, Tabitha.
Tabitha?
Well, that's funny.
She was here just a minute ago.
Oh, she must be playing hide-and-seek.
It's her favourite game.
- Would you mind looking on the patio?
- No, not at all.
- Well, I'll look out front.
- Good, good.
We don't really think she's playing hide-and-seek, now do we?
No.
We really think that Grandmama is up to one of her tricks.
Not guilty, Samantha.
- Witch's honour?
- Witch's honour.
Tabitha, wherever you are I want you to come out this instant.
Samantha.
- Samantha, look for something small.
- I beg your pardon?
When a mortal child feels responsible for a grown-up argument that child gets upset and runs away, right?
Well, yes, but But a little witch wouldn't have to run away.
She could change herself into something else.
That way she can hang around and watch the grown-ups making idiots of themselves.
- Oh, of course.
I remember the time you and Daddy were having that silly argument Never mind that time.
Remember the time your father and Uncle Arthur were quarrelling about who would take you to be introduced at court?
Just barely.
You changed yourself into a postage stamp.
That must be how I ended up in Istanbul.
Exactly.
Well, it wasn't much fun.
Those Turks are kind of rough.
You know that little beauty mark that's on your shoulder?
That's where they cancelled you.
Well, all we have to do is look for something small that Tabitha changed herself into.
Yes.
Tabitha, if you're in there, I want you to come out at once.
- Did you hear me?
- Flower bowl.
Flower bowl.
Are you Grandmama's pretty little Tabitha?
Tabitha Oh, hi.
Tabitha's such a good little hider you just have to look everywhere for her.
Yes.
Yes, we looked outside all around the house and she was nowhere to be seen.
I don't want to be nosy but were you just talking to this flower bowl?
Flower bowl?
I?
My dear, why should I do an eccentric thing like that?
There's nothing for us to do but call the police.
First I think I'll have a cookie.
Would you like a cookie, Mother?
Oh, the poor things.
They're cracking up.
You're always feeling sorry for everyone else but me.
- I'll get your sherry.
- I'll get a tall glass.
Now.
Tabitha.
You will turn back into yourself by the time I count to three.
- One, two - Three.
Tabitha.
She wasn't here a moment ago.
I know it.
- Where did she come from?
- Well, now, let's see.
She came from Well, she came I just came back from being a raisin cookie.
Frank, remember your marriage vows: In sickness and in health.
Now Now, Mrs. Stephens, sometimes little girls have little secrets that grown-ups shouldn't try to understand.
Thank you dear, I'll I'll hold that thought.
And I vote we continue this weekend after Frank and I come back from our cruise.
What cruise?
The Mediterranean one I just decided we'll take.
Excuse me.
- Did I do something bad?
- Yes.
- It really wasn't your fault.
- Will I be punished anyway?
Of course not, my little angel.
Not until later.
Want a cookie?
I hope putting her to bed without dessert wasn't too severe a punishment.
I don't think it's going to warp her personality if that's worrying you.
Oh, but chocolate pudding, Samantha.
Her favourite dessert.
Honestly, Mother.
Mommy did a no-no.
There are times when mommies are allowed to do no-nos.
Now, you go to sleep, young lady.
Right now.
What happened to you?
I ran a collision course with your chocolate pudding.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Mother, you sent that chocolate pudding to Tabitha.
- Now, tell the truth.
- I always tell the truth as I see it.
Mother, you are an incorrigible witch.
And you are an insensitive, selfish, mortal-marrying child.
Well, you don't have to get that huffy about it.
I guess she does have to get that huffy about it.
Oh, well.
Mom?
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Mother.
It becomes you, dear.
After all, if you' re gonna work like a slave you might as well look it.
I am not a slave.
I enjoy cooking dinner for my husband and our guests.
Coquilles St. Jacques.
Prepared by a witch in the mortal way.
Not bad.
Of course, it's not ambrosia but it's quite good enough for Durwood.
What's the occasion?
We are entertaining Mr. And Mrs. J. Earle Rockeford.
They are very rich and very social.
He's a client of McMann and Tate.
Why don't they have them for dinner?
Because Louise Tate is out of town.
That's why we invited them here.
He's a very important man.
There are no important mortals, my darling.
You' re wasting your time.
This one's important.
His ancestors came over on the Mayflower.
Rockeford?
Rockeford I don't recall seeing any Rockefords on the Mayflower.
Probably in steerage.
Mr. Rockeford has a very big account.
And Darrin might get it.
He loves Darrin's ideas.
I was right.
He did come over in steerage.
Honey, I'm home.
Where are you?
- In the kitchen.
- Where else?
Be right there.
Now, you've had your little joke.
So, Mother, before you leave, would you mind?
Anything for you, darling.
Came home early to see if I could help.
- Oh, what?
- Oh, censored.
What can I do to help?
You could have done something five years ago by not proposing to her.
Mother, it's getting close to sock-it-to-you time.
Why resist temptation?
Let me do it.
Perhaps a muzzle would quiet his mortal bark.
- Now, Mother, Mother.
Darrin.
- You Now, now, please.
I'm sorry I dropped in.
That makes it unanimous.
Darrin, I don't think you should have said that.
Why not?
She's gone, isn't she?
Oh, Darrin.
Won't you ever learn?
Well, that was a splendid dinner, Mrs. Stephens.
- First-rate, I'd call it.
- Thank you.
- And to think you did it all by yourself.
- That's right.
You poor dear.
How long have you been without help?
Oh, quite some time now.
Well.
Well, now that the amenities are over I suppose we may as well just get right down to cases.
Exactly how I feel.
As you probably know I am the president and chairman of the board of the Burning Oak Country Club.
No, I wasn't aware of that.
Well, now you know.
And as you also probably know we don't just take anybody into the club.
No.
What's the point of having a club if you' re not going to be exclusive?
Yes.
There's so little breeding in the world today.
Stephens, I have a feeling that you' re the kind of man that would fit in at Burning Oak.
That's very flattering.
Meant to be.
Of course, the board will have to pass you but I don't see any trouble there.
- No.
That's because Earle is the board.
Darrin, you' re a lucky young man.
- Sam, you should be proud of him.
- I always have been.
There are only two things you have to do, young man.
Take a deep breath and say yes.
As I said before, it's a great honour.
- I agree.
- But I'd like to think about it.
What's that you say?
I have the feeling that Samantha and I aren't quite up to rubbing elbows with the Burning Oak set.
Are you trying to say that you' re too good for Burning Oak?
No.
No, he wasn't saying that at all.
Let him do the saying.
I didn't mean that.
What I am saying is that I'm not sure we' re ready.
Darrin's been working very hard, Mr. Rockeford.
- He's tired.
- So am I. - Well, time to go.
It's late.
- It's only 9:30.
- Hortense, I said it was late.
- Yes, dear.
And I thank you for a lovely dinner, my dear.
You' re very welcome.
Too bad about Burning Oak, Stephens.
You would have made a fine caddy.
Mr. Rockeford, about that little business matter.
Now You will hear from us, Tate, in the not-too-distant future.
But, Mr. Rockeford, I' II call you tomorrow.
Larry, Larry, think before you speak.
I have been thinking.
Of all the stupid, childish, idiotic things to do!
We were just about to wrap up the account.
Why?
Larry, all I asked was a little time to think about it.
In our business we don't have time to think.
If I thought my turning down Burning Oak would blow the deal Well, It has.
And speaking of blowing, it's time to go.
- It's late.
- Nine-thirty, Late?
It's later than you think, Darrin.
Thanks for the dinner, Sam.
You' re welcome.
I think.
I've been thinking, honey.
Maybe I was too rough tonight.
Well, the Rockefords did come on pretty strong.
I can't help feeling that in his own snobbish way, Mr. Rockeford was trying to help me.
So, tomorrow I' II apologize both to Larry and Mr. Rockeford.
Well, maybe that is the best way.
Can't do any harm to give Burning Oak a chance.
It may turn out that we like the people very much.
I' II handle the situation first thing in the morning.
Good night, honey.
Hi, Larry.
Good morning, Stephens.
- Stephens?
That's me.
- I. I. Larry, I've been doing some thinking lately.
So have I. And I've come to a decision.
I want to apologize to Mr. Rockeford.
You already have.
- I have?
- I knew you would, so I did it for you.
Just a minute, Larry.
If anyone apologizes for me, it's me.
- I. - Yeah, I. I can do my own apologizing.
You' re about to get that golden opportunity.
Rockeford was so taken by your apology that he invited us to play golf with him at Burning Oak Country Club this afternoon.
Larry, I have a full calendar.
I thought you'd learned that no one says no to J. Earle Rockeford.
Besides, there's a little matter of a discussion about the account.
Larry, I prefer talking business in a business atmosphere.
And Rockeford prefers talking business in the atmosphere of his club.
And that's the atmosphere we' re going to talk in.
Oh, hi, what are you doing home?
I'm playing golf at Burning Oak with Mr. Rockeford and Larry.
- Good.
Then everything went fine.
- I have my reservations.
- Excuse me while I change.
- Certainly.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mrs. Rockeford.
Yes, we enjoyed it too.
Lunch, today?
At the club?
They do?
Oh, why, yes, I'd love to.
One 'o clock.
I' II be there.
Bye.
Sweetheart?
You' re not the only one going to Burning Oak.
Mrs. Rockeford has invited me to lunch.
She wants me to meet some of her friends.
Great.
How about a sitter for Tabitha?
I' II get Aunt Hagatha.
She said that these friends of hers were were ladies on the screening committee.
Well, that's just routine.
To become a member, you have to be screened.
Sounds like something they do to keep the flies out.
Who are they trying to keep out?
Honey, you' re just being oversensitive.
Well, if they don't like flies, they certainly won't like witches.
They' II love you.
A priceless performance by featherhead up there.
- Meaning what?
- Meaning that he's reduced you to hobnobbing with the snobs at Burning Oak Country Club.
Mother, Darrin doesn't like the idea any more than I do.
It's just good business tactics.
Besides, he feels badly about being rude to Mr. Rockeford last night.
Rubbish.
He's thrilled to death.
And in no time, he' II be out-snobbing the snobs.
You' re wrong, Mother.
Darrin cannot be intimidated.
He's his own man.
He couldn't have made a worse choice.
Mother, I' II give you just three seconds.
One will do.
Good.
Within the moment we shall see what a snob this clod can be.
Stephens, you' re Burning Oak material.
Yeah, you know, I can't tell you how much better I feel about your change of attitude.
- I just needed time to think it over.
- How do you like the course so far?
- We love it.
- Quite adequate, in my opinion.
What's wrong with it?
It has potential.
In time, with the right thinking, it could be the finest club in the country.
In my opinion, it already is the finest club in the country.
My opinion exactly.
Sorry, Larry.
You have no frame of reference.
Too many years under public links.
This young man may have something.
After all, he has got a head on his shoulders, eh?
- This is delicious.
- Well, it's our pleasure, dear.
- We just wanted to get to know you.
- Oh, we did, indeed.
I'm only sorry that we didn't seem to find any friends in common.
Please, don't be sorry.
We've been hoping, just a wee bit of hoping that you might know the Vandergrifts.
No, Darrin and I don't know the Vandergrifts.
Darrin, this is your husband?
Yes.
He works for an advertising company.
- Works?
- Sure.
That's how we eat.
But it's just that at Burning Oak, our husbands are the company.
I guess that's what makes Burning Oak so exclusive.
- And empty.
- Yes.
Yes, we like it that way.
You see, we try not to let any undesirables slip in.
- Do you know Dr. Hafner?
- Who?
Dr. Hafner, the plastic surgeon.
He does wonderful nose work.
No, I don't know him.
Let's have coffee in the card room.
I'm sorry, Hortense.
I have my bridge game.
And I must get back to my housework.
You poor dear.
You've lost your help.
Well, yes, in a way.
My help is lost until I get back home.
Hortense, darling, I can't thank you enough for the lunch and meeting the charming Mrs - Stephens.
It was wonderful to meet you.
I wish I could spend more time with you but I'm late already for my couturier.
- By all means, don't let me keep you.
- Good bye, all.
- Good bye.
I've been meaning to tell you, Mrs. Stephens.
That's a very amusing little frock you' re wearing.
Did you make it yourself?
No, I had my couturier run it up.
It's lovely.
And who is your man?
Oh, it isn't one man.
It's two.
They call themselves Sears and Roebuck.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
How'd you do with the ladies?
Sorry I didn't meet them.
Sorry I did.
That Jessica Morton, carrying on about her couturier asking me if I made my own dress.
I could have turned her into a worm.
And it wouldn't take much turning.
Sweetheart, no witchcraft, not at Burning Oak.
Which reminds me, we should be thinking about moving.
- What's wrong with our house?
- It's not the house.
It's the neighbourhood.
If we moved closer to Burning Oak then you could be close to your friends and get to know them.
Darrin, you' re tired.
Why don't you lie down and take a nap?
I'm sure you' II feel better by dinnertime.
I'm fixing your favourite.
Corned beef and cabbage.
My taste buds just don't relate to that sort of thing.
Just what do they relate to?
I was thinking in terms of chateaubriand.
Or perhaps lobster Newburg, with caviar as an appetizer.
We' re fresh out of that stuff.
Well, I don't mean here.
I was talking about dinner at the club.
You mean we' re having dinner at Burning Oak?
Rockeford invited us.
Well, I' II have to get Aunt Hagatha back to baby-sit.
- Fine.
It' II be black tie, of course.
- Of course.
I do hope you have something appropriate to wear.
I' II run up something.
While we' re on that subject, Mrs. Morton has a point.
You ought to see a good couturier.
Oh, no.
And when you do, take Tabitha.
Mother.
Oh, Mother, you' re a stubborn witch.
Now, I know you've put a spell on Darrin so you get here and undo it, pronto.
Aunt Hagatha, what are you doing here?
You called for me to come and sit with Tabitha.
Have you forgotten?
Sorry.
Do you know where Mother is?
- Oh, I've no idea.
- Terrific.
- Is something wrong?
- Everything's wrong.
You name it, and it's wrong.
Maybe I can help.
After all, if a witch can't help who can?
- Mother put a spell on Darrin.
She turned him into a snob.
Now he's out-snobbing the super-snobs of all time.
Of all time.
Aunt Hagatha, maybe there is a way you can help.
- Is it evil?
- Yeah.
Now first, find out if Aunt Bertha can baby-sit.
I'm gonna give you a list of names and I want you to check the backgrounds of each one carefully.
Go back three No, four generations.
Now, I' II be at the Burning Oak Country Club, so as soon as you get About membership.
Earle, how far back do you go?
In the screening, I mean.
We look a man up, and then we check on his family and immediate background.
Yes, we don't want any undesirables slipping through.
So I hear.
But do you think that's enough?
I mean, wouldn't it be better to go back maybe three or four generations?
- Do tell.
- Good thinking, Sam.
You never know what you' II find in a person's background.
Stephens is quite right.
We must protect the club for the true-blue, purebred American.
Exactly.
Here's my thought.
From my brief observation you've let too many, you know not our kind of people into the club.
My goodness.
The membership needs a thorough shakedown.
From then on, there' II be a lot more elbow room, for let's say Mother, where have you been?
I'm sorry, darling, but I was picketing this new movie about witches.
It makes us appear quite evil, you know?
If the shoe fits Why, Samantha, I'm surprised.
Don't you have any social conscience about our people?
I have plenty of social conscience about these people.
Relax, darling.
I've had my fun.
Now, Mama will take care of everything.
I stopped by just after you left, and Hagatha told me what you wanted.
I think this will take care of your snobs.
See?
Marvellous.
Yes, indeed, it will.
Now, Mother, you take the spell off Darrin.
Please?
While you' re at it, turn the time back a bit.
- I'd like to get a running start.
- Very well, Samantha.
For you, not him.
Here.
Just a minute.
Now.
Begone the hex from dreary Dum-Dum.
Enough is enough, it's getting humdrum.
Stephens is quite right.
We must protect the club for the true-blue, purebred Americans.
Exactly.
Here's my thought.
From my brief observation, you've let too many you know, not our kind of people into the club.
My goodness.
The membership needs a thorough shakedown.
After that, there' II be a lot more elbow room for the common people.
- What did he say?
- Is this your idea of a gag?
- Well - Yes, Mr. Rockeford, it is.
Darrin was just putting you on a bit.
He wanted to find out exactly what your membership requirements really are.
That's it.
I think.
You gave us quite a start there.
The truth is screens work both ways.
They keep things in and out.
And Darrin and I have decided to stay out of Burning Oak.
Young lady, I don't know what you' re up to but I must say, I do not find it amusing.
I do.
Mr. Rockeford, it's true.
Your heritage does go back to the Mayflower.
An Irishman named Toodles Rockne was a stowaway on the Mayflower.
Illegally in this country.
Well, you see, as Toodles How did you know that?
Because I belong to the greatest minority there is.
I'm a witch.
I think this is in extremely bad taste.
Mr. Morton, your grandfather came here from Poland and spent a good deal of his time in jail.
He couldn't even make it as a horse thief.
Don't move too far, Cynthia.
Does the name Moishnev ring a bell with you?
Oy vey.
Whatever that means.
I think we all know that there's no such thing as a purebred American.
Unless it's the Indian.
And an American Indian could never get in here.
Is there anything you'd like to add, Darrin?
Yes.
It's late.
You' re right.
It's 9:30.
I heard from Larry.
We've got the Rockeford account, and the screens are off at Burning Oak.
I didn't think those kind would ever change.
Well, they did, and so did Mother.
She's about to make a formal apology for what she did to you.
The reason that I'm not furious at your mother is that I wouldn't have missed the fire you lit under Burning Oak for anything.
They' re probably calling it Smouldering Stump by now.
You were wonderful.
If you weren't my wife, I'd ask you to marry me.
Samantha, I'm ready.
Here comes your apology.
Come on.
Look.
She's gonna write it 100 times.
Good.
- Oh, brother.
- Oh, Mother.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Samantha has one more chance.
Let her heed the warning of this Witches Council or suffer the consequences.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Mother, will you please stop bouncing around like Tinker Bell and tell me what all this is about?
Samantha, I'm sorry to wake you, my love but this is an emergency.
It better be.
to be playing follow the bouncing ball.
The Witches Council has finally had it with your mortal marriage.
Oh, Mother!
They've always had it, right from the very first.
I could hardly hear the wedding bells, the thunder was so loud.
Samantha!
The Witches Council means business.
And I have a message for our mighty Council.
No matter what they do, I will not disavow my marriage.
Try moving the lamp, Samantha.
Go on, give it a twitch.
I'd say they got your message.
Well?
Flowers you are, flowers you'll be.
On the count of three, you'll move for me.
One, two, three.
That's right, Samantha.
You're suffering from a power failure.
You're short-circuited, wiped out, stripped.
Mother, I made my decision, and I'm satisfied with it.
- You mean stuck with it.
- I know what I mean.
Samantha, you've not only lost your powers you've lost your heritage, your birthright, your everything.
I still have Darrin.
You just mentioned the one thing you should have lost.
Mother, guess who's not staying for dinner.
Tallyho.
Hi, Sammy.
Hi there, Uncle Arthur, you little dickens!
What a pleasant surprise.
Just thought I'd pop up and see you sometime.
Now, how do we get you to pop out?
Oh, no.
It's the Wicked Witch of the West.
I always break you up, don't I?
Oh, you!
Now, stop it, you two.
Don't you worry, Uncle Arthur.
I'll always be your number one fan.
Sammy, I'd appreciate it if you kept the toaster on light from now on.
Boy, that smarts.
Next time try the waffle iron.
It leaves a more interesting pattern.
Very good, Sammy.
Wish I'd said that.
You will, Uncle Arthur.
You will.
Hi, coz!
I just won my platinum belt.
Well, do you have to practice on my furniture?
Oh, sorry about that.
I'll fix it.
I can't hang around too long.
I have to split to India for the World Rope Climbing Championships.
They've got a new motto this year: The sky's the limit.
All right.
All right.
Will the shepherdess take the black sheep and go rope climbing?
Samantha and I are having a serious discussion.
Don't mind us.
I'm too tired to leave right away.
As a matter of fact, all I want to do is rest my weary bones.
In fact, I think I will.
Uncle Arthur, pull yourself together.
Is it true that The foot bone's connected To the leg bone The leg bone's connected To the knee bone The knee bone's connected To the thigh bone Now hear the word of the Lord The thigh bone's connected To the backbone The backbone's connected To the neck bone The neck bone's connected To the head bone - Now hear the word of the Lord.
- Right you are, bonehead.
Lucky for you, I didn't hear that.
Arthur, will you please take your sick humour elsewhere?
As I said, Samantha and l We know all about that, Endora.
That's why we're here.
And, little cousin, unkie-poo If not more.
And don't let those old crones at the Council split you and Darrin.
- No!
You're a set.
Sort of unmatched, but a set.
You belong together, like Antony and Cleopatra.
Arthur, button your lip.
Romeo and Juliet.
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.
If you won't button your lip, I'll do it for you.
Really, Endora!
Get with it.
Buttons are out.
Zippers are in.
All right.
Have it your way.
Mother, you unbutton and unzip them this instant.
Very well.
A mother's work is never done.
Endora, when I think of you as a blood relative I long for a transfusion.
As we were saying, little cousin, you just hang in there.
- You can count on us.
- No matter what, we're at your side.
I think they heard you loud and clear.
Go ahead, Arthur.
Try your tablecloth trick.
Serena, try your karate.
Why, those spiteful old hags.
What have they done to us?
Serena, let me help you out of that ridiculous outfit.
Thanks for the groovy threads, Endora.
What kills me is I voted for them in the last election.
Just goes to prove you can't trust anyone over 3000 years old.
- Now listen to me.
- Make that 4000.
All right.
I've done everything I can.
You've seen the last of me.
Watch.
She's going to get sticky about this.
I'm leaving, never to return.
- Real sticky.
- I haven't gone yet.
Well, hurry up.
We want to be alone.
Don't worry, Sammy.
Everything's going to be fine.
We'll get jobs and function just like mortals.
Yes, you'll see.
We'll adjust.
If you can do it for us, living the mortal life will be as easy as falling off a log.
And into the river and over the falls.
Sammy, the ship may be sinking but we'll stick by you.
Even if we all go down together.
"No matter what, we're at your side".
"Come on, Serena, let's pledge our loyalty".
Yuck.
"Get a job"!
You and your big mouth.
You could have objected, you know.
Your mouth wasn't zipped at the time.
Here's a strange one: Boxer wanted to work in supermarket.
Probably they want someone to beat up the shoplifters.
Probably.
Here's something: Ice cream plant.
Unskilled labour.
No experience necessary.
Well, we certainly qualify for that one.
Tricky little devil.
I know it's a match.
After all, it's on a short stick, and it has a little red top.
But how do you get it to light without witchcraft?
Arturo, will you knock it off?
I'm trying to find us a job, and all you can think about is playing with fire.
Darrin's going to expect me to give him a hot foot when he gets home and I don't want to disappoint him.
There must be instructions on the matchbook.
There are, "Learn electronics in your spare time".
Well, why don't you enroll?
And then maybe during your smoking break your instructor can teach you how to light a match.
Wait a second.
Here it is.
"Close cover before striking".
So simple.
Here it goes.
Light!
It must be faulty.
How's it going?
Find anything?
Only something that says: Unskilled labour.
No experience necessary.
Sounds made to order.
Let's go.
Well, this is it.
Looks like a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to work there.
Uncle Arthur, really.
Oh, all right, all right.
We're going.
- We're going.
- That's better.
I'll do some shopping with Tabitha and come back and pick you up later.
Good luck!
What's luck, Mommy?
It's something you need when you can't twitch.
Well, we're ready.
Hey, that's a perfect fit.
Course, anything would look good on you, baby.
I think it would look even better without your hands on it.
You know, this is the first time I ever hired anybody without a reference.
- I don't even know why I'm doing it.
- I do.
The jacket's a perfect fit.
We're wasting time.
All this talk is costing the boss a buck an hour.
I thought you were the boss.
Well, l I admit, I look like a boss but I just manage this place.
You can call me Buck.
Come on.
Let's get with it.
Follow me.
Okeydoke, Buck.
We've got a special going this week.
We're pushing the frozen chocolate-covered bananas.
- How revolting.
- You don't eat 'em.
You just make 'em.
Here's how it works.
You take the banana like this.
You dip it in the chocolate.
That should be easy.
I'm a dipper from way back.
- Excellent.
- Yeah.
She used to be known as the big dipper.
All right.
Let's not have any levity on this job no matter how weak.
- Oh, I got a critic.
As I was saying, you take the banana like this.
Dip it in the chocolate like this.
You hand it to wise guy.
He rolls it in the nuts and sticks it in the tray.
- You got that?
- Of course we've got it.
How unskilled do you think we are?
Let's try it just once more from the top.
Over here, gorgeous.
Now, we take the banana like this.
Dip it in the chocolate.
Hand it to wise guy.
Who rolls it in the nuts.
And puts it in the tray.
How'd you like that?
I liked it better when I did it alone.
All right.
Have it your own way.
Now, when you get 12 in the tray, you take the tray and put it in the freezer here.
You got that?
Of course I got it.
You're not explaining the theory of relativity, you know.
All right, Einstein, let's see how it works then.
I'm gonna start the belt, so you two stay awake.
Shoot when you're ready.
I take a banana, I dip it in the chocolate.
- Here we go.
- Here we go.
Drawing a crowd out there.
- Is my lipstick on straight?
- I'll bet.
- I could never get 'em down.
- No, neither could I. - Hope they didn't see that.
- Clumsy.
All right, all right.
Now, you're not being paid to wave.
Just dip the bananas.
My good fellow, we find that we can both dip and wave.
If he's that good, let him work alone while you and I take a play break.
- You're not exactly my idea of a playmate.
Let's move it.
There's a job to be done.
Oh, by the way, anything you ruin comes out of your salary.
By the way, what do I do when my nose itches?
Scratch it on your coffee break.
You're rotten.
Rotten.
Nine, 10, 11.
Need one more.
Thank you.
There's another dozen.
Oh, you are clever.
I wish he'd stay out of the way.
He makes me nervous.
Oh, they're speeding up.
They're speeding up!
Unk!
Unk!
They're speeding up!
I'm so far behind, you hide some of them.
- I can't - I'm doing the work of two people.
It's like the Indianapolis Speedways.
- I'll just put these in here.
- Yes.
We mustn't let them melt.
There's no time for the trays.
They're melting.
- Just throw 'em to me here, honey.
- But your nuts!
Oh, nut 'em, nut 'em!
- That's it.
- Oh, they're going on the floor!
- Just throw 'em in here.
Hurry, honey.
- Wait a minute.
You're acting just like a mortal, Serena.
Use your imagination.
That's not very nice!
Well, that was a good day's work.
- What'll I do with these?
- I don't know.
Eat 'em.
Well, how's everybody Well, gorgeous still don't wanna take that little play break?
That's cute.
That's funny.
Thank you.
You're gonna pay for that.
You know you're gonna pay for that, don't you?
Chocolate-covered manager.
Unkie-poo!
Where'd everybody go?
Is that you, Unkie-poo?
Let's face it.
We're drags.
We should really cut out of your life completely.
Oh, don't be silly.
It's because of me you were cut in.
If I ever get my powers back, the first thing I'm going to do is change that manager into a 150 pound banana.
And I'll dip him in chocolate and freeze him.
Oh, for the good old days.
- What a mess.
- You whistled?
Samantha, it should be clear to you by now that you have no choice.
Give up.
Come with me to the Witches Council and ask their forgiveness.
All right, I'll come with you, but I won't ask their forgiveness.
I want to plead my case before the Witches Council.
Those old crones haven't reversed a decision in 3000 years.
Samantha, why don't you reverse your decision?
No chance of that.
No chance at all.
Then, Samantha, the decision of our Witches Council stands.
You, Arthur, Serena and Tabitha are forever stripped of your powers.
You call this a court of justice?
I call it a hall of vengeance.
Careful, Samantha.
You'll just make them angrier.
- Try the soft sell.
- No.
I'm not going to appeal to your mercy, just your memory.
Samantha, if their memory is anything, it's convenient.
Remember the witch burnings of Salem?
Remember the innocent who were condemned simply for being different?
Remember your rage at that injustice?
Well, aren't you guilty of the same injustice?
Aren't you condemning me simply because I choose to be different?
Samantha, my darling, remember, you're risking your birthright.
Oh, I'm not risking anything.
You can take away my powers, but I'll always be a witch.
It's you, the highest of all courts, who are taking the risk your integrity, your right to sit in judgment.
- Have you finished?
- I have.
Don't call us.
We'll call you.
Talking to the Witches Council was like howling in the wind.
The clouds were so thick, I couldn't even see them.
- Maybe they weren't there.
- Oh, you're some help.
May I have the ketchup, please?
How can you people eat at a time like this?
You're right, Sammy.
We're all insensitive boors.
Pass the cauliflower, honey.
May I have the ketchup, please?
Samantha, your pacing that way isn't going to make them decide any faster.
If only there were some hint, some sign.
Sammy, I've got just the thing to take your mind off your problem.
My old tablecloth trick.
- Oh, good grief.
- I want to see it!
- That's a sweetheart.
- Uncle Arthur!
Now, please, these are our best dishes.
You've broken all the others.
It's been in Darrin's family for generations.
- It was his mother, his grandmother - Who needs hand-me-downs?
He did it with no powers.
That clown did it.
Not bad, eh?
Great!
I think.
Uncle Arthur, lend me that tablecloth.
Oh, my!
It's good to be back to normal again!
I can't stand all this gaiety!
Well, now that the big, bad witch is gone, let's dig in.
I could hardly eat while she was here.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Oh, Mother, really.
How many times have I told you I'd rather do it myself?
Samantha, it depresses me no end to see you engaged in such disgustingly mortal activities.
Well, you' re wasting your depression, Mother dear.
I enjoy painting.
Besides, this is my project while Darrin's gone.
He's gone?
Oh, what delightful news.
Permanently, I hope?
- He's in Chicago on business.
- Drat!
And if I'm lucky, he' II be home day after tomorrow.
And if I'm lucky, he' II fall into Lake Michigan.
Here paint yourself into a corner.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Stephens.
Mrs. Wehmeyer, how nice to see you.
Come in.
Oh, forgive me for barging in this way but I was in the neighbourhood, and I just thought What's that?
Pardon?
I really must have these checked.
Won't you sit down?
Well, I haven't seen you since you led the fight to save the park.
Oh, my dear, I have never forgotten that.
And, Mrs. Stephens, frankly, we need your help again.
The park's being threatened again?
Oh, no.
I'm talking about our drive to raise money for the United Nations Children's Fund.
You know how important that is.
I'd be happy to make a contribution to UNICEF.
Good.
Our committee is meeting this afternoon at the downtown community centre.
- Committee?
Well, now wait - My dear, I knew I could count on you.
- But, Mrs. Wehmeyer - The others will be thrilled to know that you' re going to join us.
But, Mrs. Wehmeyer, I don't really think I have the time Why, dear, you' re just what we need.
Someone to lead us.
Someone to inspire us to an all-out effort.
- Me?
- One o'clock, then?
One o'clock.
Ta-ta.
Ta-ta.
Samantha, I have a perfectly splendid idea.
Why don't we hop on a cloud and fly off somewhere?
I mean, as long as Darwin's away.
I'm sorry, Mother, but I can't.
I have just volunteered to be drafted.
Where are you going?
What about the meeting?
Well, it's over, my dear.
Didn't you say 1:00?
Did I?
Well, it doesn't matter now.
I'm afraid we've suffered a severe setback.
- Well, what happened?
- I don't even want to talk about it.
We had a pledge for $10,000 from E.J. Haskell, the builder and now he's reneged on it.
Oh, what a shame.
What made him change his mind?
- Who knows.
- You won't believe this but we can't even get ahold of him to find out.
Well, there must be something we can do.
- Well, what can we do?
- I don't know.
Can't he be sued for breach of pledge?
Samantha, we've tried everything.
We've written to him.
We've sent him wires.
- We haven't been able to get near him.
- But that's not fair.
- I mean, after all, he promised.
- Mrs. Stephens?
We did have one thought.
What's that?
To select one member to concentrate on Mr. Haskell for 48 hours.
Oh, well, that is a good idea.
Then you agree?
- Oh, of course.
- I knew you would.
Here.
This piece of paper has Mr. Haskell's home address and his business address.
- What?
- And good luck.
They say there's a sucker born every minute but you' re trying to raise the average.
- Mother, who's sitting with Tabitha?
- Hagatha.
And I'm afraid she's a little put out.
I just zapped her out of an eight-legged race.
What's that?
Oh, my darling, it's all the rage.
You saddle an octopus, and you try to break it.
Come on.
I' II show you how it's done.
Mother, Mother, I can't.
I'm going to be busy trying to break a two-legged maverick.
- Murdock?
- Yes, Mr. Haskell?
Where's that decorator?
Wasn't he supposed to be here at 2:00?
It's a she.
They' re sending a young lady.
Well, she's two minutes late.
I' II get it.
You bring the car around.
- I' II be ready in a few minutes.
- Yes, sir.
You' re two minutes late.
I am?
Well, don't stand there.
Come in.
All right.
Come along.
Right in here.
Here we are.
Well, what do you think?
L Pardon?
Well, I'm not asking for any specific ideas.
I just want your immediate general reaction.
Oh, well, that's good.
Because it's easier to be general than specific.
That is, usually but not always although sometimes it's harder to be general.
The important thing is to know what you' re talking about, right?
- Right.
- What are we talking about?
About redecorating this room.
What else?
Well, it certainly could use it.
Exactly.
Incidentally, I thought you did a great job at the Wilsons'.
They' re very high on you, you know?
That's very sweet of them.
They' re a lovely couple.
Fred Wilson and his mother?
Fred does have a problem, doesn't he?
Well, I'm not needed here.
Now you look around, get some ideas.
I've gotta run.
Mr. Haskell, I already have some ideas.
- You have?
- Yes.
Mr. Haskell, you' re a builder.
You know the importance of a good foundation, right?
Right.
Don't you think the children all over the world deserve a good foundation?
Sure.
But what's all that got to do with redecorating?
Well, actually, I'm not your average decorator.
In fact, I'm not a decorator at all.
Who are you?
Why did you go back on your pledge to UNICEF?
So that's who you are.
Yes, I'm one of the housewives for UNICEF.
I'm very busy, miss.
Mr. Haskell, I'm not leaving until I get a direct answer to a direct question.
Are you gonna make good on that pledge?
No.
You don't have to be that direct.
Can't we sit down and talk this over?
In a minute, you' re going to make me forget my manners.
I didn't ask you to come barging in here.
Oh, yes, you did.
As a matter of fact, you ordered me in.
Well, now I'm ordering you to get out.
What manners were you talking about?
Goodbye.
And if you' re smart, you won't show your face around here again.
For two cents, I'd huff and I'd puff, and I'd blow your house down.
That's what happens when you get involved with mortals and their petty problems.
Thanks for the advice, Mother but a world full of children who need help is hardly a petty problem.
Furthermore, no one is going to slam a door in my face and get away with it.
Never show my face around here again, huh?
I' II make him sorry he ever saw it.
Bye-bye, Mother.
I have to get to work.
What's holding us up?
There's a truck blocking the street, sir.
Well, how did you Where's my Look, young lady, you get out of this car before l I beg your pardon, sir?
- Good afternoon, Miss Blake.
- Here are your calls, Mr. Haskell.
Oh, yes.
Thank you.
Oh, Mr. Haskell?
Don't you want your mail?
No.
No.
Yes, Mr. Hask ell?
Come in here right away.
I'm going to ask you a simple question.
Look up there and tell me if you see See what, sir?
Nothing.
What was the name of that psychiatrist I went to last year?
Now, I want you to describe to me exactly, to the smallest detail this person you keep seeing.
Well, she's young, blonde, kind of pretty.
In fact, very pretty.
Does that mean something?
Does it mean something?
I' II say it means something.
- What?
- I don't know.
But everything means something.
The important thing is what does it mean to you?
Look, Doctor, I'm paying for answers, not questions.
But, my dear fellow, without questions there would be no answers.
Understand?
No.
Now what?
Your refusal to understand is symptomatic of the anxiety state and clearly indicates that your sensor refuses to permit the id to supersede.
Well, could you explain that in simpler language?
Of course not.
I'm a psychiatrist, not a nursery school teacher.
- Look, I'm a busy man.
I haven't - Wait, wait.
Yeah, I think I know how to get to the bottom of your problem.
Well, it's about time.
I will give you some word images and you will say the first thing that comes into your head.
We will begin.
And no profanity, please.
- Ready?
- Yeah.
- Black.
- Blue.
- Red.
- White.
Blonde.
Pretty.
- Young.
- Old.
What is it?
What is it?
There's that pencil.
Thought I lost it.
I don't think we' re getting anywhere.
Which is why you' re a patient, and I'm the psychiatrist.
The reason for your hallucination is obvious.
Well, what is it?
Oh, boy, have you got a mental block.
Don't you see?
This hallucination represents your doubts and anxieties about your marriage.
But I don't have any doubts or anxieties.
You' re getting married, and you have no doubts or anxieties?
No.
My dear chap, you really are sick.
What I am saying is that I keep seeing this blonde I have to get a cigarette.
I thought you didn't smoke.
I don't, but my nurse does.
Ask me, he ought to see a psychiatrist.
What was that, my dear chap?
Now, I am going to ask you one more question.
Have you got, maybe, something on your conscience?
Have you, maybe, made a promise and then gone back on it and the young lady keeps reminding you?
Is that possible?
Doctor, Doctor!
I'm seeing her now!
Exactly where are you seeing this hallucination?
Right there.
In that chair.
You must be joking.
There is nobody in this chair but me.
Now, let's get back to your conscience.
You're wasting your time, my darling.
Mother, if you want an appointment, just ask the nurse.
Nurse.
Nurse!
You can't appeal to his conscience.
He doesn't have any.
Samantha how would you like an intelligent suggestion?
From whom?
I' II ignore that.
Why don't you find this little vixen he's going to marry and see what makes her tick.
Mother, you' re absolutely right.
I have to cherchez la femme.
But, Doctor, I tell you!
She is sitting right here in your They' re gone.
There was more than one?
Her mother was with her.
Or was it your mother?
My dear fellow why don't you lie down, and let's have a little talk about your mother.
I thought that if anyone would appreciate how badly that money is needed, it would be you.
After all, you lived in India.
Well, actually, I only lived there for about a year.
Two months for the marriage and 10 months for the divorce.
But you had a chance to see how terrible the poverty is and how badly they need help.
No.
But I heard about it, of course.
Then you' II ask Mr. Haskell about his donation?
Look, I'd like to help you but I make it a rule never to ask for anything before the wedding.
But you wouldn't be asking for anything.
Just the same, he's old enough to decide a thing like that for himself.
Boy, is he old enough.
Of course.
But couldn't you just You asked me a question, and I gave you my answer.
That's right.
You did.
I'm sorry I took your time.
Okay.
I thought she'd never leave.
I thought you'd never come out.
- Well?
- Mother, looks like we were right.
She's not the kind of girl one takes home to Mother, is she?
Only if Mother's not home.
Oh, it's beautiful, poopsie.
Oh, it's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
- But you shouldn't have.
- Why not?
After all, you talked me out of making that donation and you saved me $10,000.
- And this is my commission?
- Exactly.
Oh, poopsie, you' re such a doll.
I love you so.
Not at all, my dear.
Can you believe that?
No.
But apparently poopsie does.
I think what's indicated here is a little dose of truth salts.
- Do you have some?
- Oh, darling I never go anywhere without the tools of my trade.
- Waiter.
- Yes, miss?
What is the correct time?
It's about 7:30.
- Thank you.
- You' re welcome.
Oh, poopsie, I' II never forget this night.
- Would you care for the wine list?
- Not right now, waiter.
Thank you.
When we' re married, we' re going to eat at home.
- Wait till you taste my cooking.
- Good.
I hate restaurants.
Once you taste my cooking, you' II be glad to go to a restaurant.
- Who said that?
- You said that.
I know, but I don't know why.
Actually, I'm very good in the kitchen.
It's just that I don't know a thing about cooking.
What is this, some kind of game?
No.
Really.
Believe me.
Why would I do that?
You know how I feel about you.
How much I adore your money.
I don't like this game.
Oh, poopsie, where's your sense of humour?
I never thought bad taste was funny.
I'm sorry.
Really I am.
All right.
Let's just forget it.
Would you like to go somewhere when you' re finished?
Oh, that would be great.
Except I have a date with my boyfriend.
I think I'd better take you home.
No.
Wait.
I didn't mean that.
Let me explain.
All right.
Explain.
In fact, I've got a better idea.
Here.
Here's some cab fare.
Sorry about that.
Oh, no.
No.
You' re all I need right now.
- May I sit down?
- How could I stop you?
Look, I know you've had a shock, but Wait a minute.
It's just beginning to dawn on me who you are.
You' re my conscience, aren't you?
- Well, you could say that.
- Of course.
And I'm not going to get rid of you until I make good on that pledge to UNICEF, right?
That's the idea.
In that case, I' II do it.
Marvellous.
Now, I brought a pen and a blank check, just in case you didn't have one.
Are you kidding?
I can't give you a check for $10,000.
- Why not?
- You don't even exist.
You' re my conscience.
Waiter.
But, Mr. Haskell Oh, wait till I tell my doctor about you.
He thought you represented my doubts and anxieties but you' re far too attractive for that.
Are you going to be at this all night?
When I recover from dealing with my conscience l' II be glad to talk to you about my doubts and anxieties.
Till then, bye-bye.
I don't know why but I have the distinct feeling that I've been insulted.
- Martini?
- Make it a double.
At it again, eh?
Yes.
And I'm almost finished.
Oh, I thought you were at the underwater rodeo.
Oh, I was eliminated.
I was thrown by a bucking sea horse.
Oh, what a shame.
Would you like some breakfast?
Oh, that's a lovely idea.
Then we can take off, just the two of us, and have some fun.
- Forget it.
- Don't be snippy.
Darrin came home last night, and he's still asleep.
Guess who just lost her appetite?
Paint the clouds with sunshine.
- Good morning, my dear.
- Hello, Mrs. Wehmeyer.
I've got the most delicious news.
Guess what?
Mr. Haskell came through with his $10,000 donation.
You' II never guess.
We got that $10,000 donation from How did you know?
You must be psychic.
Well, anyway, dear, I rushed right over to tell you so you wouldn't waste time trying to see him.
That is good news.
He said his conscience had bothered him all day yesterday.
And then he said the strangest thing.
What was that?
He asked me if I'd ever seen a blonde conscience.
- Oh, that is weird.
- Yeah.
Oh, well, I must run to the bank.
Oh, thanks anyway, dear, for volunteering.
Ta-ta.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Oh, honey.
Oh, gosh.
That's just great.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Now, open the champagne.
I have one more surprise.
I don't know if I can stand any more surprises.
This is a special surprise.
Something for both of us.
Sounds intriguing.
Give me a hint.
That's a hint?
What'd you give me, the Eiffel Tower?
Daddy!
- I should've known.
- Sweetheart, I had no idea.
What a wonderful surprise.
To her, he's a wonderful surprise.
To me, he's a demolition ball.
Samantha, my child, let me look at you.
Magnificent as always.
And why not?
After all, I'm your daughter.
Precisely.
Excuse me, but I believe your car is parked on my rug.
Does that distress you?
No trouble.
Macbeth, later.
As I recall, we were discussing something rather fascinating.
- What was it?
- You.
Yes, of course.
It seems there's a hole in my wall.
Does that distress you too?
Not aesthetically, but I'm freezing.
Of course, how thoughtless of me.
Close, Sesame!
If I seem to be more affable than usual, Dolphin - Darrin.
- It's only because you happen to be standing in the fallout of my love for my daughter.
Of course.
How are you, sir?
Blooming, blooming, in magnificent health.
- He wouldn't have it any other way.
- Certainly not.
- Happy birthday, my boy.
- "My boy"?
Well, isn't that the proper way to address one's son-in-law?
Well, it is sort of a shock.
I admit that I merely tolerated this marriage right from the start.
But when I see the glow in my daughter's eyes the warmth of her smile, the aura of beauty that surrounds her well, you put it there.
How, I'll never know.
- But there it is to see.
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah, thanks.
- Let's drink to that.
I'd like a very dry martini.
Spanish gin, Italian vermouth and a Greek olive.
I don't know if we have those ingredients.
Don't bother.
I'll fix it myself.
In appreciation for your having made my daughter so happy, Dolphin Darrin.
I'd like you to accept a small token of my half-hearted esteem.
A little birthday present, if you will.
Well, thank you, sir.
Let's not be so formal.
Call me Maurice.
- I'll try.
- It's a lighter and a perpetual calendar.
Well, how about that?
Yes, I've invested that lighter with a small portion of my own powers so that it may serve your every command.
You mean if I use this, I can zap this and pow that and ring-a-ding up anything I want?
Crudely but accurately expressed.
Maurice, I appreciate your gesture.
I'm sorry I can't accept it.
You have the effrontery to refuse my gift?
- How dare you!
- Let's not get all steamed up, Maurice.
- "Sir" to you, Dustbin.
- Darrin!
Daddy, I think Darrin's just trying to remind you how he feels about taking advantage of you know what.
Samantha, you've picked a lemon in the garden of love.
You're married to an obstinate fool, a stubborn jackass.
I am not!
Darrin is a wonderful human being.
Not necessarily.
Samantha, I think there's a jackass on your rug.
Good grief!
And that, my dear, is final.
But why?
Just an honest difference of opinion.
You say he isn't a jackass.
I say he is.
Daddy!
Daddy, how could you do such a thing to Darrin?
You've taken away the one thing that's made me so happy.
Samantha, I have not taken away the cause of your happiness.
I've simply changed his form, and not much at that.
I happen to prefer the original.
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of there.
Won't we, dad Daddy?
Daddy?
Daddy, this is no time to play hide-and-seek.
You come back here right now!
It's way past our bedtime!
Oh, father, if malice could be mined like gold you'd be worth a fortune.
Darrin.
Sweetheart, I love you.
Now, look.
I don't blame you for being a little bit upset.
But Well, look.
I promise you.
You don't have to be a mule any - any longer than absolutely necessary.
Now, sweetheart, when daddy gets back Well, I must admit he deserves it but I wouldn't press your luck.
In the meantime, we'll just have to adjust.
Sweetheart, wouldn't you be a little more comfortable if you slept outside?
It's a lovely, warm night.
Come look.
And you forgot to mow the lawn out back so it's nice and thick.
See?
Lt'll be nice under the stars.
I could get a sleeping bag and join you.
Abner, there's a jackass in the Stephens' living room!
Is that a nice way to talk about your neighbours?
I mean, a real jackass.
What's an eight-letter word for murder?
Abner, why don't you ever listen to me?
I listen to you all the time, except when you talk.
There, I draw the line.
If you' re worried about Tabitha having a trauma over this, don't.
She took the news like a good little sport.
As a matter of fact she wanted to know when you'd take her for a ride.
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but you can hardly blame her.
I'm fixing your favourite breakfast.
Eggs Benedict.
Good morning, Mrs. Kravitz.
What's that in your kitchen?
- What's what in my kitchen?
- The mule.
It's a mule.
That's what I thought it was.
I stayed up all night trying to convince Abner there was a mule in your house.
That's my daddy.
Your what?
She named him Daddy.
Well, that's what he is.
My grandpa made a no-no.
I'll say that's a no-no.
You're not allowed to keep mules as pets.
He's not a pet.
He's my daddy.
Tabitha, it isn't nice to argue with grown-ups.
Run outside and play.
Even if you were allowed to keep a mule in the house who would want to?
I mean, it's not sanitary.
I assure you he is bathed regularly and is quite housebroken.
Here you are, Daddy.
You're feeding eggs Benedict to a mule?
A happy pet is a healthy pet.
Eat up.
Not so fast, Daddy.
Abner will never believe it!
I don't believe it.
I tell you, it is a jackass and she is feeding him eggs Benedict for breakfast.
Lucky jackass.
All I ever get is lumpy oatmeal.
Laugh, laugh.
I have a good mind to call the animal shelter.
Mother?
Mother, I know you can hear me so put that champagne down right this minute and get over here tout de suite.
I'm sorry.
Champagne should never be gulped.
Now, what is your problem?
Well I see you have a new pet.
Oh, how nice.
It's not nice at all.
It's Darrin.
Oh, of course.
I'd know him anywhere.
- Mother!
- Very well.
You and Darwood had a quarrel.
No.
Daddy and Darw Darrin had a quarrel.
Spare me the gory details.
- What am I gonna do?
- Nothing.
Nothing, of course.
I've always said, "Father knows best".
You've never said that!
I'm saying it now.
Oh, mother, stop kidding around.
You have to help me find him.
Well, let me see.
If I know your father, and I think I do he'll be flitting about the south of France this time of year.
Why don't you pop over and track him down?
It's your problem, Samantha.
You argue with him.
But who'd baby-sit with Tabitha?
Darwood, of course!
In case of an emergency, he can always bray for help.
Oh, such wit.
We'll only be gone a few minutes.
Well Now, sweetheart, we'll be back just as soon as we can find daddy.
- I hate long farewells.
- Don't worry about a thing.
Just take good care of Tabitha And the countess was never quite the same.
Hi.
I'd ask you to join us, but the table is so small.
Yvette, this is my daughter, and my her mother.
Daddy, I must talk to you about Darrin.
Dr. Bombay forbids me to discuss family problems at the aperitif hour.
It gives me heartburn.
Daddy, you have to help Darrin.
Well, if he needs help, I suggest you call in a qualified veterinarian.
You know exactly the kind of help I'm talking about.
He cannot go to the office in that asinine condition.
Then I suggest he try a different line of work.
Say drawing a milk wagon, huh?
That's very good, Maurice.
Now help your child so I can get on with my shopping.
Yes, but not right away.
I'm taking my final exams this afternoon.
In what, may I ask?
Karate.
Yvette is my karate instructor.
Maurice.
- I'm sorry to be late.
- That's quite all right, my dear.
Samantha, Endora, this is Angelique an associate of Yvette's in the karate business.
Imagine that.
At your age to take them on two at a time.
It's an advanced course, and quite handy in the event one is attacked both from the front and the rear.
That event may be coming up right now.
Samantha, you're turning into a nudge.
Ladies, enjoy your drinks and go on over to the studio.
I'll join you later.
If I'm delayed, you can start without me.
Darrin, Tabitha, we're home and grandpapa is with us.
- Mommy!
Mommy!
- What is it?
It's daddy.
They took him away just now.
They Who took him away?
Two men in white coats, no doubt.
Green coats.
Mrs. Kravitz came in with them.
They put him in a truck and said daddy couldn't live here anymore.
What man?
What truck?
I don't know.
He gave me this.
"The animal shelter"?
Good grief!
Let's look on the brighter side of things.
Among all those dumb animals, Dolphin should be quite at home.
Darrin?
Darrin?
Sweetheart?
Oh, sweetheart, I just found out.
Well, it must've been terrible for you.
It's din-din time, kids.
Come and get it!
Come on, sweetheart.
We're going home.
Did you see that?
See what?
Nothing.
All right.
Who's the wise guy who's hiding the mule?
Sure, you play chess while I'm feeling so guilty at what I did to that poor, dumb animal, I could cut my throat!
I think I put a new blade in the razor this morning.
It's your move.
Mrs. Stephens'll probably never speak to me again.
I'll send her a letter of congratulations in the morning.
Abner, the jackass is back!
Mule, sweet mule parting is such sweet sorrow.
But Dolphin must be back at work tomorrow.
That's terrible!
- I thought I read it rather well.
- I mean, he's not changing.
Yes.
Well, you win some, you lose some.
Well, I must get cracking, or I shall be late for my karate finals.
No, you don't!
You're not leaving until you give him back to me exactly the way you found him.
The sacrifices a father makes for his child.
I'll try the laying on of hands.
Lowly beast of the field be welcomed unto the fold.
Believe, and the gates of your heart shall open wide and you will walk through.
Hallelujah.
Nothing's happening.
What do you mean?
Plenty is happening.
I'm getting an abominable headache.
Wait half a mo.
That's the fly in the witch's ointment.
The jackass and I are both trying too hard.
Oh, daddy, for heaven's sakes.
This is no time for chess.
It is precisely the time for chess.
Mutual concentration on a common problem will make us as one.
Beauty and the beast.
Come along, Dolphin.
You' re white.
Your move.
All right, sweetheart.
Just point it out.
Gently, sweetheart.
You have very clumsy lips, sweetheart.
I'll move this for you.
The Ruy Lopez opening.
A crafty little beast, aren't you?
Are you sure, Darrin?
I will not tolerate coaching from the sidelines.
Let the jackass play his own game.
I knocked, but no one heard me.
Let's get on with the game.
It's your move.
He's playing chess?
Amazing.
What's so amazing?
I usually beat him two out of three.
I can't wait to tell Abner about this!
You're getting into trouble there, Dolphin.
Move bishop out of the way, and you can castle.
Castle?
King Arthur!
By George, I've got it!
I once had a run-in with a cowardly knight and turned him into Well, that doesn't matter.
Last night when I wrought that remarkable change for the better in your husband's appearance, I was standing here, Dolphin was there.
Samantha, you were here, and let me see.
Endora, you were nowhere.
Scat!
Now we must get rid of this.
Now we shall recreate the entire event.
You have the effrontery to refuse my gift?
How dare you!
Now, let's not get all steamed up, Maurice.
- "Sir" to you, Dustbin.
- Darrin.
Daddy, I think Darrin's just trying to remind you how he feels about taking advantage of you know what.
Samantha, you've pick ed a lemon in the garden of love.
You're married to an obstinate fool, a stubborn jackass.
I am not!
Darrin is a wonderful human being.
Not necessarily.
Samantha, I think there's a jackass on your rug.
Hold it!
Reverse!
Thank you from the bottom of my withers!
Not at all, my boy.
As Bill Shakespeare once said to me, "The quality of mercy is not strained.
It droppeth as a gentle rain from heaven upon the place beneath.
It is twice blessed.
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes".
Daddy, let's not get carried away.
Terribly sorry.
Endora, Endora.
- It's hard to be a parent.
- Yes, darling.
Darrin was tired, so he went to bed.
Daddy, I'm worried.
He was thirsty, and That's something to worry about?
He wants his water in a bucket.
That is something to worry about.
Forget it, child.
It's merely the residual of his recent hee-haw.
It'll pass in time.
Mrs. Stephens?
Oh, hi.
Mrs. Stephens, I need the name of a good sanatorium.
Is something wrong with you, Mr. Kravitz?
Not me, Gladys.
The poor kid.
You know what she said?
She said you have a jackass that plays chess and that could probably beat me.
Can I live with a sickie like that?
Well, as a matter of fact, our jackass did play chess.
You'll have to show me.
Well, he's gone.
Please, Mrs. Stephens, don't try to protect Gladys.
What my daughter meant was that the jackass has just gone into the kitchen for some milk and cookies.
I'll fetch him.
Is he kidding?
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
Daddy?
I never could resist a ripping game of chess.
You're white, Mr. Kravitz.
It's your move.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Tabitha, you promised Daddy you'd eat all your breakfast.
- I will.
- He meant today.
- Good morning, ladies.
- Oh, Daddy.
Hi, Grandpapa.
Well, look at my lovely little Tabitha.
She's outgrown the toddler stage and blossomed into early witchhood.
Where's Dennis?
Dennis who?
Your husband.
The M-O-R-T-A-L.
D-A-R-R-l-N is at work.
- Devastated to have missed him.
- Oh, well, he' II be devastated too.
Now, sweetheart, you finish your breakfast.
Grandpapa and I will be in the living room.
- Samantha, you look absolutely radiant.
- I do?
Yes, there's a special aura about you.
So special that its vibrations have zonked across the atmospheric continuum and led me to you.
- Well!
- What's happened?
Nothing, except I'm happy to see you.
You ought to zonk across the atmospheric continuum more often.
I will, now that I've increased my efficiency.
Increased it?
Daddy, when it comes to efficiency you are one of the all-time greats.
That's very kind of you, dear, but the truth of the matter is I'm getting a little older and a bit forgetful.
So, I've engaged an assistant.
An assistant warlock?
Kind of a private secretary.
- Would you like to meet her?
- Oh, I'd love to.
Miss Beecham, on duty, please.
- Hi, there.
- My daughter Samantha.
Miss Abigail Beecham.
What's your first impression?
Well my first impression is that she looks - Yes?
- She looks very efficient.
- Miss Beecham, tell me - Yes, my dear?
Have you had much experience?
As a secretary, I mean?
Of course she's had experience.
Why else would I hire her?
Oh, I don't know.
There might be another reason.
- Mommy, I ate all my breakfast.
- Oh, that's a good girl.
Miss Beecham, this is my daughter, Tabitha.
- Hello, ducky.
- Hello.
You' re beautiful.
Isn't she, Grandpapa?
Yes, now that you mention it.
Yes, she is.
Sweetheart, why don't you run outside and play?
I want Grandpapa to make me a toy.
- Tabitha, really.
- I'd be delighted, my darling.
Now, how about a nice little swing set?
Okay.
That's some little swing set.
Tabitha, haven't you forgotten something?
- Thank you, Grandpapa.
- You' re welcome, my dear.
That's better.
And you remember, the swing set is only temporary.
When Grandpapa goes, it goes.
Okay.
Scoot.
A strict mother, aren't you, lovey?
Well, not exactly.
It's just that I feel Speaking of formidable females, how's Endora?
Oh, she's fine.
When was the last time you saw her?
Two or three months ago, maybe 18.
My wife and I have what might be described as an informal marriage.
That's the best kind.
I'd like to meet her someday.
That can be arranged.
Mother?
- Oh, Samantha, no need to bother.
- Oh, Daddy, don't be silly.
Miss Beecham said she'd like to meet Mother and I'm sure that Mother would like to meet Miss Beecham.
Mother!
Darling, did you call?
- Endora, ravishing as usual.
- Maurice, how scintillating to see you.
It's Noel Coward time.
- Who is that?
- Noel Coward time is over.
- Mother, that is Miss Abigail Beecham.
- This is Endora.
Nice to meet you.
She's a private secretary.
- To whom?
- To me.
He hired her to increase his efficiency.
- His efficiency?
In what?
- My efficiency in general.
Abigail, to demonstrate your efficiency, take a little dictation, will you?
Hamlet, act two, scene two.
"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I"!
He can say that again.
"O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous that this player here But in a fiction, in a dream of passion Could force his soul so to his own conceit" and so on and so forth.
That's it.
Perfect.
Not bad.
Her typewriter needs a new ribbon, but Oh, Samantha, there's no skill to that.
Any witch can type a Shakespearean soliloquy.
But there's something about her physical dexterity.
Oh, you admit it!
It isn't her skill.
It's her outward appearance.
Endora, you know me better than that.
I judge witches by their character.
Good.
In that case, you won't mind this.
- Mother, that is skill.
- Thank you.
Don't worry, Maurice.
She still has the same character.
Maybe, but I will not have you tamper with her out of spite.
- Where was I?
- At the un-beauty parlour.
Endora, that reminds me of the time when you got mad when a young witch flirted with me, and you had her drafted into the army.
Oh, yes.
- What was her name again?
- Attila the Hun.
Abigail, why don't you and I have a cup of coffee and let the two lovebirds reminisce?
- All right.
But you pull any more tricks on me, and I' ll Abigail, don't live dangerously.
My mother has the most powerful one-two punch in the cosmos.
Come, come.
Endora, have you noticed that Samantha is remarkably vibrant?
No!
And please don't change the subject.
What is the subject?
The subject is you and Abigail Beechnut.
- How long have you been married?
- Five years.
- And your husband is a mortal?
- Yep.
Well, that's one for the record.
You have a lot of courage.
I'd never do it.
I wouldn't even get married to a handsome, young warlock.
How about a handsome, older warlock?
No, I'm not the marrying type.
I like to keep moving from one romance to another.
I see.
I guess wherever you go you leave behind you a trail of broken hearts.
Yes, I do.
But it takes them a couple of weeks to wipe the smiles off their faces.
Endora, have you quite finished nagging at me?
I have not.
Then will you allow me a brief moment to make an observation?
You have 10 seconds.
- I hate to say this, Endora, but - But what?
I've come to the conclusion that you' re jealous.
I?
I?
You!
You!
Oh, that's absurd.
I haven't a jealous bone in my body.
Well, how's everything going?
You leave my husband alone or I' II disintegrate you.
What did I do?
Nothing.
She's jealous of you.
Oh, well, that's understandable.
Mother, have you and Daddy been quarrelling?
- No.
- Yes.
I merely pointed out that your father is making a fool of himself.
Did you point it out in a nice way?
Samantha, I will repeat for your benefit what I told Endora.
My relationship with Abigail is professional.
Purely.
That's right.
And thanks for defending my reputation.
There!
There, you see?
- They' re carrying on in public.
- Now, Mother, he's only If you have no consideration for me, at least think of your daughter.
- Oh, really.
- Oh, darling.
Try not to let this scar you permanently.
Yes, Mother, I' II try.
Daddy, at least tell Mother you' re sorry.
- Sorry for what?
- I don't know.
Think of something.
Endora, if by any remote chance I've done something to offend you - Don't touch me.
- But I'm your husband.
- Not for long.
- What does that mean?
I am going straight to the Witches' Council and I'm going to file for an ectoplasmic interlocutory.
- You' re kidding.
- On what grounds?
On the grounds of conduct unbecoming to a warlock.
She doesn't mean it.
I'm sure she doesn't mean it.
Do you think she means it?
I don't know.
We' II have to wait and see.
- In the meantime - Yes?
What's for lunch?
Samantha, I have to admit that, despite my misgivings so far, your marriage seems to have agreed with you.
Well, thank you, Daddy.
Wish I could say the same for yours.
My marriage agrees with me.
It's your mother who doesn't.
I don't think I've ever seen her so angry at you.
Oh, I have.
We've been through these little misunderstandings for centuries.
But has she ever threatened you with an ectoplasmic interlocutory?
No.
But I suppose there's a first time for everything.
You don't seem too worried.
Yes, it' II be a difficult adjustment for me, but I' II struggle to make it.
And you' II have Abigail to help you.
Speaking of help, can you carry these two plates in for me?
Didn't I just give you two plates?
They' re on the dining room table together with those - Thanks.
- Come along, my dear.
- What's for lunch, ducks?
I'm starved.
- Ham and cheese sandwiches.
- Oh, what else?
- Potato salad.
And if you want dessert, there's ice cream.
- I want dessert.
- Yes, I know you do, sweetheart.
Sandwiches, potato salad and ice cream?
What kind of lunch is that?
It's a gourmet lunch, mortal-style.
I just thought I'd show you how the other half lives.
I'm not interested.
I want my regular lunch.
- Then make it yourself.
- Okay, I will.
That's your regular lunch?
What do you have for dinner?
Oh, dinner's my big meal.
I'm almost ready for that ice cream.
Abigail, you' re a jolly good eater.
Now, you have a nice nap, Tabitha.
And when you wake up Grandpapa is going to recite Macbeth for you, from beginning to end.
You lucky girl.
Mother?
Mo We' II talk in your bedroom.
- I don't want Maurice to know I'm here.
- Okay.
What took you so long?
I travelled the hard way.
Well, did you go to the Witches' Council?
No.
I realized that an ectoplasmic interlocutory might be just what your father wants.
- So?
- So, I won't give it to him.
- Mother, that's just an alibi.
- For what?
You yourself don't want an ectoplasmic interlocutory.
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.
What difference does it make what I want, when your father wants Miss Abigail Beechwood?
By the way, am I on Durwood's side of the bed or yours?
- Mine.
- Good.
Mother, Daddy doesn't want Abigail.
Deep down, he knows that you are the only one for him.
Then what can I do about it?
How about the old jealousy approach?
It's corny, but effective.
Whom could we get?
Dr. Bombay's nephew.
The one that looks like Steve McQueen?
He is Steve McQueen.
Besides, he's too young for you.
Well, isn't Abigail too young for your father?
Well, yes, of course.
But, you see, we'd be much cleverer if we - Are you ready for this?
- No.
But tell me anyhow.
John Van Millwood.
Maurice will have an absolute fit!
Let's do it.
Maurice, let's go.
I'm bored.
We are waiting for me to recite to my granddaughter.
Tabitha will be up from her nap in a few minutes.
What am I supposed to do whilst you' re reciting?
You can listen to me, enthralled.
Or you could whip up 30 pounds of hamburger and fix yourself a snack.
I don't want to spoil my dinner.
I dropped by to Oh, I didn't know you two were still here.
Goodness gracious, if it isn't John Van Millwood!
- Oh, so you remember me, eh?
- Remember?
How could I ever forget?
Brisbane, Australia, the annual Warlocks' Coven.
You played Brutus to my Antony an interpretation calculated to cause the stones of Rome to rise in mutiny.
Come off it, mate.
The audience couldn't understand a word you said.
Balderdash.
Hi.
I'm Abigail Beecham.
Hi.
John, you remember Samantha, don't you?
I said, John you remember Samantha, don't you?
- Yes.
Yes, of course.
- What a pleasant surprise.
Endora, did you enjoy yourself at the Witches' Council?
Oh, I never got there.
I flew into John, and we had an intimate lunch together.
Broiled kangaroo, no doubt.
Broiled kangaroo is a taste sensation.
Or could it be that you object to us having lunch together?
Oh, don't be silly.
Daddy doesn't mind Mother being friendly with other warlocks do you Daddy?
- Depends on who they are.
Miss Beecham, are you a thespian?
I beg your pardon?
An actress, dear.
Oh, I'm a private secretary.
She keeps my husband busy, so I can be busy elsewhere.
They do make a cute couple, don't they?
Like fire and water.
Miss Beecham, you have the bearings of a great actress.
How would you know?
- That does not become you, Morris.
- Maurice.
Maurice.
However, I shall disregard it on the basis that Will Shakespeare always said that my interpretation of Romeo was by far the best of the warlocks.
"But, soft!
What light through yonder window breaks?
It is the east, and Juliet is the sun".
Great heavens!
Those vowels.
I suppose you delude yourself to believe you could do it better.
Infinitely.
"It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon Who is already sick and pale with grief That thou her maid art far more fair than she".
That was very good too, Daddy.
What do you mean, "too"?
His performance was enough to make Shakespeare turn over in his grave.
Endora, I am shocked that you would associate with an untalented, fraudulent colonial.
I' II associate with whomever I please, just as you do.
- That is no comparison.
- Why not?
Miss Beecham is young enough to be my daughter and he is old enough to be your husband.
Then doesn't that make their association more logical?
Certainly not.
If he were youthful and handsome I could understand his attraction for an older female.
But if you find this ancient relic attractive I' II have you know, I was Mr. Torso of Tasmania.
This ham from Down Under afflicted with an appalling speech impediment then, Endora, as your husband I am insulted to the very marrow of my bones.
I'm tired of all this arguing.
I think I'm going to find myself another job.
Come to think of it, I could use a travelling companion.
Would you be interested?
I might.
Well, I'm convinced you really are star material.
- Really?
- Yes.
Suppose we go someplace and discuss it, eh?
Farewell, Endora; Samantha.
"Good night, sweet prince And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest"!
No, no, no.
The tip of the tongue, the teeth, the lips "Flights of angels sing thee to thy rest"!
Talking of rest Oh, Maurice, there's no one who can hold a candle to you.
Thank you, my dear.
- Samantha?
- Yes, Mother.
There is something different about you.
Some kind of an inner glow.
I've been telling her that all day.
The last time I saw her look this way was a little Samantha how old is Tabitha?
That's it.
That's it.
Samantha, you' re going to have another baby.
I am?
Answer the question: Are you going to have another baby?
True or false?
- Those my only two choices?
- Yes.
Okay, then it's true.
I am.
- Oh, my darling.
- Another little nipper.
How delightful.
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going, Samantha?
I'm going to call Darrin.
I had this foolish idea that after the doctor and me he'd be the first to know.
- Grandma.
- Grandpapa.
Yes, Darrin.
I will.
I will.
I won't.
I will.
I will.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
I'm thrilled you' re thrilled.
- Bye.
- How very exciting.
Soon there' II be a handsome little warlock the spitting image of his grandfather.
Well, it could be a mortal boy, the spitting image of his father.
Samantha, bite your tongue.
Oh, here's my precious.
Come along.
Macbeth, act one, scene one.
We open on three nice witches, stirring a great big pot.
Daddy, could you hold the curtain?
I'd like to tell Tabitha too.
Please.
Come along, sweetheart.
Tabitha.
Have you ever wished for a little brother or a little sister?
Sometimes, but not very often.
Well, I'd like you to start wishing it more often.
- When will it come?
- In about six months.
Where is it now?
Daddy and I will explain that later tonight.
Instead of television?
Yes.
Sorry about that.
Now, won't that be fun, having a real live baby to play with?
I'd rather have a pony.
Well, you' re gonna get a little baby.
Will it be a witch or a warlock?
There's always a chance that it' II be a mortal boy or girl.
- I say a witch.
- I say a warlock.
Boy or girl?
Witch or warlock?
Which?
Oh, good grief.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
All right, sweetheart, here, here, here.
You take those upstairs, and then we'll leave, okay?
- Okay, Mommy.
- Careful.
Heavy, aren't I?
Uncle Arthur, you get out of there.
Hi, Sammy.
I just flipped my lid.
Cousin Henry.
You're not being very original stealing Uncle Arthur's jokes.
I'll have you know I taught him everything he knows.
Where is Uncle Arthur?
He's at the Cannes Film Festival picketing Rosemary's Baby.
Why don't you pop out of that box and say hello?
Hello, Sammy.
You look great.
- Thank you.
- And there's the little dream boat.
- Hi.
- Hi, Cousin Henry.
- What did you bring me?
- Oh, Tabitha, really.
What did I bring you?
Go and look behind the couch.
I already have a jack-in-the-box.
Not like this one.
Open it.
Hi, Tabitha.
Hi, Jack.
When Cousin Henry brings something, he brings the real thing.
Well, the real thing will have to go.
But I want to play with Jack.
We'll discuss that later.
Send him home.
Boy, is she a noodge.
Henry!
All right, all right.
Goodbye, Jack.
I wish you'd let me know you were coming, Cousin Henry.
I didn't have time.
It was a sudden case of heartburn.
My heart had a burning desire to pay a family visit.
It's in me, the heart.
I'm afraid we haven't much time.
Tabitha and I are going shopping.
- Where?
- Hinkley's Department Store.
- Well, I'll go with you.
- What for?
Why, I have nothing to do, so I might as well do nothing.
You'd be bored silly.
Don't worry about me.
I'll find something to do.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Tabitha, would you like me to go shopping with you and Mommy?
Whatever Mommy says.
There, you see?
Your own daughter insists.
- Good morning, Samantha.
- Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, little Tabitha.
Good morning, Grandmama.
Well, well, well, the Clown Prince of the Cosmos.
Where's King Arthur?
Endora, when I think of you as a blood relative I long for a transfusion.
All right, you two.
Do you mind if Tabitha and I go shopping while you quibble?
- Shopping?
Whatever for?
- Tabitha needs some new dresses.
- But you don't have to shop for them.
- I like to shop for them.
- Come on, Sammy, let's go.
- Why are you going?
- Sammy wants my opinion.
- When did I say that?
If you want his opinion, then you certainly want mine.
Mother, to tell you the truth, I don't exactly want Then it's settled.
We'll all go shopping together.
I give up.
Let's go.
This has gotta be kicks.
Yeah, I'll bet.
I've seen better interior decorating in a butcher shop.
- I think it's very nice.
- Not by my standards.
My idea of a nice store is Mars Fifth Avenue.
Or Spell Casters.
Or Cosmos Costumes.
Or Or how about getting on with our shopping?
This isn't too dreadful.
It's only $14.95.
Put it back.
At the rate Tabitha's growing, it's too expensive.
Hello there, folks.
My name is Joseph Hinkley Jr. - Are you the owner?
- Not yet.
I'm the owner's son.
- Do you work here?
- Well, yes, ma'am.
As a matter of fact, today's my first day on the job.
I just got out of college where I'm majoring in business administration to prepare me to carry on my family's tradition to the utmost of whatever potential ability I possess.
All she asked was do you work here?
Yes, ma'am, I do.
May I help you?
Yes, yes.
We were looking for some dresses for my daughter.
Oh, and a beautiful little girl she is too.
- Did you see anything that you like?
- Yes.
Yes, I like this one.
That's 14.95.
Exactly.
How'd you like to reduce it to 3.50?
- Oh, gee, I'd really like to, but - How about 4.99, including tax?
No, no, I'm afraid our prices are very firm.
That's one of the numerous things my father's very strict about.
Oh, this is sweet.
Do you like this, darling?
Yes, Mommy, it's nice.
I believe that's a genuine domestic cotton.
And only five dollars.
We'll take it.
May I show you something else?
How about this?
White polka dots on a sea of midnight blue.
Midnight blue.
Yes, that's lovely.
Do you like that too, sweetheart?
All right, we'll take both.
Boy, my initial sale, and it's a doubleheader too.
Let's call the photographers.
- Will this be charge or cash, ma'am?
- Charge, please.
Clerk, clerk?
Clerk?
Would you Would you see Mrs. Stephens over to the charge counter please and have those wrapped?
- Of course.
Right this way.
- Thank you.
- Behave yourself.
You too.
- Sure.
Sure.
How about you, sir?
We have some exceptional values in our men's department.
- He doesn't need anything.
He does too.
- Sensational.
I'll escort you personally.
- What do you need?
- I need to have some fun.
- At whose expense?
Guess.
This is the biggest bargain in our store.
It's reduced from $85 to 47.50.
What do you call it?
I call it a sports jacket.
- I mean, what do you call the material?
- Oh, it's a worsted.
I don't want your worsted, I want your "bested".
That's funny, sir.
Will this be cash or charge?
Oh, not so fast.
This fabric is atrocious.
It looks like it could come apart in your hands.
That's unbelievable.
I guess that's why Dad's willing to let it go for 47.50.
I don't give up easily.
I'll show you something else.
Was that a good one, or was that a good one?
That was a good one.
Kindly restore the jacket.
This is our double-breasted blazer with the deep side vents.
See?
It's in a sparkling burgundy red.
- I'm not interested.
- Well, just try it on.
I said I'm not interested.
Sir, with all due respect, it's not fair to a garment to just dismiss it without even trying it on.
- Mr. Hinkley.
- Yes, ma'am?
My nephew has a quick temper.
Don't push.
For your own good, don't push.
Yes.
Here, Tabitha.
You sit down here.
You wait and be a good girl.
We'll be going home in a minute.
All right?
Look, I'm gonna level with you.
See, my father doesn't have much faith in me.
And I thought if I could show him that I made two sales in two different Henry, what are you up to?
Nothing.
He's up to something.
He's trying to ram this sale down my throat.
And I don't like anything rammed down my throat.
Unless, of course, it's a ram doing the ramming.
Oh, my stars!
Boy, Gabe, you really uncorked one this time.
I meant a four-legged ram, not an L.A. Ram.
Which one are you?
I'm I'm Jack Snow.
Any relation to Jack Frost?
Where?
Where am I?
You're in Hinkley's Department Store.
Patterson, New York.
New York?
We were playing the Dallas Cowboys in Dallas, Texas.
I was running a down and out pattern.
I've heard of the long bomb, but, boy, this is ridiculous.
Send him back, Henry.
- Get my jacket, please.
- Oh, no, no, no.
Because after you see this one, you're gonna fall in love with it.
- L - Just try it on.
Mother, what's going on here?
I don't know, but it's beginning to get interesting.
Is there something you're not telling me?
Okay, gang, come on, let's go.
At last, while the going's good.
Mr. Hinkley Good grief!
Henry, this is really a good one.
Coming from you, that means a great deal.
Help!
Help!
- Who's there?
- Albee.
Albee who?
I'll be seeing you Really, now be quiet.
You too, Mr. Hinkley.
Now don't panic.
We'll get you out of there.
Release him, Henry.
No, I refuse.
- Why?
- Because he started it.
Henry, I demand that you reverse that spell.
So do I. - So do I. - You stay out of this.
Henry, my patience is wearing thin.
Now, either you release him, or I'll Threats?
Am I getting threats from my own cousin?
- You're insufferable.
- Threats and insults.
Well, that does it.
I can take a hint when I'm not appreciated.
Wait!
Henry, come back!
Call a doctor!
Mr. Hinkley, this is not a medical problem.
Mother, can you release him?
No.
Neither can I. I'll go ask Henry to come back.
He'll undoubtedly giggle at me, but I'll ask him.
Mother, wait a minute.
Now, why don't you take Tabitha home first?
Tabitha, sweetheart.
This is the kind of thing that she should not be in on.
See if you can get Aunt Hagatha to babysit, then go find Henry.
And I'll cover here.
Now, Tabitha.
Grandmama is going to take you home the fast way.
I know I don't usually approve of that kind of thing, but this is an emergency.
- Aunt Hagatha is going to babysit - Is this going to take long, Samantha?
Well, I'll explain later.
All right?
Here, bye-bye.
- Weren't there three of you?
- Were there?
Well, may I help you with anything else?
No.
No, thank you.
I was just browsing.
Get me out of here!
Who said that?
Who said what?
- Have you seen my son?
- No, Mr. Hinkley, I haven't.
How do you like that?
His first day on the job and already he's goofing off.
Well, if you see him, tell him to report to me.
I keep telling his mother that kid is a dummy.
Dad, I'm in here!
I told you no talking.
You're Pardon me, madam.
Were you just talking to this mannequin?
Yes.
Hinkley's mannequins are so realistic I thought he was a real person.
Mr. Hinkley, I know that you'd like to be out of there so if you'll just bear with me for a minute I think I can remedy the situation.
I'm rehearsing a speech?
I'll be back in a minute.
- You wait right here, okay?
- What choice do I have?
- Mother.
Mother!
- What?
Did you get Aunt Hagatha to babysit, and did you find Cousin Henry?
Yes and no.
Yes, you got Aunt Hagatha and no, you didn't find Cousin Henry.
Very good.
He must be hiding.
We got an order to pick up all your dummies.
There's gonna be a new display set up.
- Well, go right ahead.
- Right.
Get those two.
Stop!
Hold it!
- What's your trouble?
- Nothing.
Why did you say, "Stop!
Hold it"!
?
I didn't.
I thought you said it.
Sure, Harry.
Put me on.
Only I know why you're doing it.
I didn't do anything.
You're jealous because I made the employees' bowling team and you didn't.
Cousin Henry, come back here.
- Shall I keep looking?
- Please.
Maybe he went to Switzerland for the annual cheese-tasting festival.
I thought I heard females.
Madam, are you aware that this is a men's fitting room?
It is?
Well, I must have gotten lost.
I was looking for an exit.
- Where's your friend?
- What friend?
The exit has a sign over it reading "Exit".
Thank you.
Mr. Hinkley.
Mr. Hinkley?
Mr Oh, pardon me, sir.
Could you tell me what happened to the dummy that was standing right here?
What dummy?
The mannequin that was That was I couldn't resist that little bit of humour.
- They took it away.
- Where?
Well, I don't know.
Probably to the basement.
Why do you ask?
Because I admired the suit it was wearing.
Perhaps I can find it for you on the rack.
Never mind.
I didn't admire it that much.
What are you doing on the moon, Henry?
I'm moonlighting.
You get it?
Moon, light, moonlighting.
I get it.
I get it.
Samantha wants you back on the Earth.
Well, I'm not going.
- Oh, Henry, please.
- I refuse.
I'm sulking.
And now I think I'll do it in a sulky.
Giddap!
Okay, first we undress them, then we take off their heads.
- No, don't do it!
- What do you mean, don't do it?
- I didn't say a word.
- Well, who did?
I don't know.
Beats me.
Maybe one of the dummies.
It's possible.
You might be a ventriloquist.
If I was a ventriloquist, I wouldn't be working here.
I'd be in show business.
Unless you became a professional bowler.
It's all coming out, isn't it, Harry?
All the hatred you've been holding in that subconscious brain of yours.
Look, is it my fault if I'm a good bowler and you're a lousy one?
I am not lousy.
I'm mediocre.
Look, Harry.
A sport like bowling it's only a game.
Don't let it ruin our friendship.
Don't touch me!
- Why would I touch you?
- I didn't say that.
You did.
You're trying to shake me up on purpose because you're afraid.
Of what?
That my bowling will improve.
Excuse me.
Lady, this room is for employees only.
Thank goodness I found him.
- Him.
Who him?
- This mannequin.
I saw him upstairs in the men's department and I was wondering if he was for sale.
No.
Hey, lady, out of curiosity, what do you want him for?
Well, I make all of my husband's suits.
And he's just the right size, so I thought I could use him as a model.
No kidding.
You make all of your husband's suits?
My wife won't even knit me a sweater.
Sorry, lady.
We'd like to help, but it's against the rules.
- Oh, well, thanks anyway.
- Yeah.
Hey, Fred.
You really think that's why she wanted the mannequin?
To make her husband's suits?
Takes all kinds, Harry.
- Hey, you know, it's time for lunch.
- Right.
I'll get some cold drinks out of the machine.
No question about it.
Gotta get that checkup.
Thank you.
Okay, Harry, where'd you put the mannequin?
- The one the lady wanted.
- It's right there, Fred.
You never know when to quit, do you, Harry?
Okay, Fred, where'd you hide the mannequin?
I didn't hide the mannequin.
You hid the mannequin.
I didn't hide the mannequin, Fred.
Okay, Harry, I've had it.
Put them up!
Mother.
Mother?
- I found Cousin Henry.
- Wonderful.
- Then I lost him.
- Terrible.
If only one of us had seen the kind of spell he used.
I saw.
You did?
Why didn't you tell us?
You didn't ask me.
Tabitha, now think carefully.
What did Cousin Henry do?
I think he went like this.
The transcendental triple.
Do you wanna take a crack at it or shall I?
Oh, no, go ahead, be my guest.
My anti-transcendental triple is a little rusty.
- Where am I?
- You're with friends.
And as a friend, I hate to do this so soon.
Why did you do that?
So I can take him back where he belongs without his knowing about it.
- Will you stay with Tabitha?
- Certainly.
Of course.
You won't remember anything bad And you'll follow my lead when I talk to your dad Your incantations are getting a little rusty too.
Mother, at a time like this, you can't have Shakespeare.
- Grandmama?
- What, darling?
When will we have our lunch?
As soon as we finish recuperating from our morning.
Oh, there you are.
Your father's been looking for you.
You're darn right I have.
Where have you been?
- Well, l - He's been helping me.
- Where?
- Oh, all over the store.
After my mother took my daughter home your son and I went on a shopping spree.
You mean my son sold you all that?
Yes, sir.
Then why didn't I see you do it?
Because Why didn't he?
Because we moved so fast, he couldn't keep up with us.
Right.
Mr. Hinkley, your son is a very dynamic salesman.
He is?
And he's such a pleasure to do business with that I have decided from now on to make Hinkley's the family store for my entire family.
- That's our slogan.
- I know.
I invented it.
Mr. Hinkley, in this day of the generation gap you are very lucky to have a son so dedicated to carrying on your tradition.
And it's only my first day on the job.
Son, I am proud of you.
And your mother will be proud too.
As soon as she gets over the shock.
Well, I'd better be going.
Thank you very, very much.
It's been my pleasure.
- Joey.
- Yes, Dad.
Take the customers' packages out to her car.
Well, nobody's perfect.
Thank you.
Here, Mr. Hinkley, let me help.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
You naughty little eavesdropping witch.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to find out if we' re going to Mexico City.
This mortal life has addled your brain, Samantha.
Darrin's advertising campaign may introduce a new soft drink, Bueno, to the American public.
It's a multimillion-dollar project.
I think it's a multimillion-dollar bore.
You would.
There's a chance you' II be able to baby-sit Tabitha for a couple of days.
A chance?
If Señor Aragon likes Darrin's presentation we are going to Mexico City.
That's not a chance.
That's practically a guarantee that you won't be going to Mexico City.
Mother, just be available.
Just whistle.
Good.
Your husband has some excellent ideas that Señor Garcia will be very pleased with.
Yes, it's great stuff, Darrin.
This is a marvellous job.
I' II be very proud to present this to Señor Garcia tomorrow.
You?
I thought I was going to make the presentation.
You' II undoubtedly be going down there later, anyhow but I feel this should be a summit meeting.
Presidente to presidente.
We'd better be running along.
We've got to catch a 5:00 plane.
Excuse me.
Send us an enchilada or something.
- Señora Stephens, Señor Stephens.
- Senor.
Thank you for your very gracious hospitality.
- You' re welcome.
- Well, so long.
Well, there goes our trip to Mexico City.
Honey, those things happen in business.
Why should I feel bad?
Who cares if I did all the work, and Larry wants to be a glory grabber?
Who cares about Mexico City anyway?
- We do.
That's who.
- Right!
Hi, sweetheart.
How was your golf game?
Miserable.
I won all the money, and I hated every minute of it.
Poor darling.
You teed off at 10:00, and you' re still teed off.
Sorry.
Let's go out on the patio.
You can have a sandwich and some cold beer.
If this were Bueno, I'd choke.
Yes, I know.
Sam, do you realize that Larry Tate, the ugly American is in Mexico City for three glorious days that belong to us?
In fact, right this moment he's having lunch with Raul Garcia and Carlos Aragon.
And he's pitching my presentation.
Sweetheart, I have a few things to do so you read the funnies and do the crossword puzzle.
Enjoy yourself.
I like it.
- It is the work of a talented man.
- Thank you.
Carlos tells me that you have another man who is very imaginative.
- Señor Stephens.
- Yes.
Bright boy.
I've brought him along carefully.
And under my guidance in a couple of years, he may develop some of my judgment and creativeness and insincerity.
I meant sincerity, of course.
Of course.
In any case, I' II handle the Bueno account personally.
Even though I don't like the stuff.
- Who said that?
- You said it.
And why don't you like it?
I do.
I do like it.
I drink it all the time.
I don't know how I happened to say that.
Just a slip of the tongue.
A very long slip.
No, really, I love it.
And I love Mexico.
It has so much to offer us for a backward country.
What am I saying?
I assure you, Mr. Tate that at least we are not backward in the social graces.
I know.
I know.
Let me apologize.
Believe me, I admire the Mexican people.
So strong, so artistic, so sleepy.
I didn't mean it.
I don't know why I'm saying these things.
Perhaps you are tired.
Yes, very tired.
I am impressed by your presentation, but I have made up my mind that That I haven't made up my mind yet.
I will look this over again.
I don't understand why I am reconsidering it but we shall meet again for lunch tomorrow.
- Now, if you will excuse me.
- Yes, of course.
I honestly don't know what happened to me.
As you Americanos might say l'm afraid that you have walked the bases full.
And it is time to bring in a relief pitcher.
Perhaps someone more simpático, as we say.
Perhaps Señor Stephens.
Yes.
Yes.
I' II get him here immediately.
- And does he speak Spanish?
- Fluently.
It would help if he could say a few words in Spanish to Señor Garcia's directors and associates.
He' II do it gladly.
He's quite a linguist.
How's the Spanish coming?
This is called So You Want to Speak Spanish Fluently in Five Minutes.
My fluency is hours overdue.
Well, maybe it' II come on strong in the stretch.
And where's your mother?
She's late.
Anything to make it inconvenient for me.
She' II be My mother, the beach bunny.
Look what I won in the surfing competition.
I'm a champion hotdogger.
That's fine, Mother, but They'd never seen anybody hang 21 before.
Ten toes, ten fingers, and my nose right over the front of the board.
Hello, my little darling.
Hello, Grandmamma.
Enough of the pleasantries.
Let's just say goodbye to the old lady of the sea.
What did she say?
She said she hopes we have a good time.
Oh, with her babysitting, and my having to give a speech in Spanish l'm beginning to doubt it.
Having trouble with Spanish?
I' II give you a little zap.
No zapping.
I' II learn it my own way.
- Oh, I doubt that.
- Mother.
- What?
- Well, goodbye again, sweetheart.
Now, listen.
You take good care of Grandmamma, okay?
There.
And now, I have something for Durwood.
Higgledy-piggledy Chestnut tree No one now will ever see How embarrassed you will be When you speak The fluent Spanish All your fears Will merely vanish Okay, now let's try this greeting.
Close your eyes and repeat after me.
Oh, well, that was ex Darrin.
Darrin, don't look now.
But, if you do look, you won't be able to see yourself.
Where'd I go?
What happened?
I'm back again.
Ruthie, is there a man in C-8 talking to a cute blonde?
Yes.
Your Spanish was perfect, but when you spoke it, you disappeared.
This is one of your mother's delightful pranks.
Why?
I think I've picked up a virus or something.
Say something else in Spanish.
Maybe I accidentally switched contact lenses with my roommate.
I disappeared again.
Mother's up to something.
When is your mother going to butt out of our lives?
- Well?
- Never mind.
I know.
Never.
Now, dear, don't worry.
I' II go back and find out what's going on.
Hello, darling.
If you' re popping in because you' re so concerned about Tabitha, just relax.
She's having a nap.
I am not concerned about Tabitha.
I am concerned about Darrin.
Mother, what have you done to him?
I didn't do anything to him.
Nature did it.
Every time he speaks a word of Spanish, he disappears.
Oh, how amusing.
Mother, it isn't funny.
What have you done?
The old lady of the sea just tried to help the poor, frightened soul.
I merely cast a spell to remove his fear when he spoke Spanish.
Since it removed him, the poor boy must be all fear.
Oh, it's priceless.
Mother, you take off that spell.
You tell Durwood the old lady of the sea will take off the spell after he's learned his lesson.
And in the meantime?
In the meantime l'd advise him not to speak any Spanish.
Mother you make a mockery of the word "mother".
- It was Mother, all right.
- It figures.
Ruthie, is that cute blonde still in her seat?
Yes, she's there.
Now, don't be upset, sweetheart.
You don't have to speak Spanish.
Least, not for a while.
I thought so.
There's one very important word I've got to say.
It's the name of the product.
Bueno.
Jadies and Lentleman, we are now approaching Cexico Mity.
Go ahead, Darrin.
Dazzle him with a little español.
Why do you think I brought you down here?
Probably because you blew the first meeting with him.
We' II have lunch at a charming outdoor restaurant that overlooks the lake at Chapultepec Park.
It's one of my favourite places.
I'm sure you' II like it too.
Maybe we should stop at our hotel first.
Check in, and so forth.
I will see that your baggage gets to the hotel while you' re at lunch.
My car is this way.
I think, properly handled we could find a large market for your product in the States.
There is one thing that puzzles me, Mr. Stephens.
You always call my wonderful drink "the product," "the drink," et cetera.
You never say Bueno.
Say it for me.
Well For heaven's sakes, Darrin.
Maybe I shouldn't tell you this but he's superstitious about saying the name of a product before he has the account.
Now, that is silly.
Bueno simply means good.
Say it for me, please.
Well, you see, I've been thinking.
That word doesn't mean anything to most Americans.
I think it should be renamed for the American market.
What?
This altitude gets to you.
Remember how it was with me?
What name did you have in mind?
Something with sparkle, lightness, gaiety.
That has zap.
That's exactly what I had in mind.
A zap.
Lively, bubbly.
You could say, "Get some Zap in your life".
What do you think about that?
Well, I think I think I ought to think it over.
And, now, let me show you one of the most beautiful cities in the world.
Well, that's very kind of you, but No, no, Señor Garcia.
We'd be imposing.
Besides, you' II need a little time by yourself to think about Zap.
You' re right.
I even have to think over why I said I'd think it over.
While you' re doing that, I' II escort Sam and Darrin to their hotel.
When you refused to speak Spanish, you made me look like a fool.
What's new about that?
I told you I only had a little Spanish!
- Don't cloud the issue with facts.
- Come on, fellas.
Yes, and where did this idea for Zap come from?
Well, Larry, I hate to tell you this It was like a sneeze.
She couldn't hold it back.
Well, okay.
But you'd better be good tonight.
Samantha, I'm getting desperate.
You relax, sweetheart.
I' II pop home and see what I can do.
Pierre, I think we' II start with pâté de foie gras and truffles à la Monique.
- Mother!
- Yes.
What's going on here?
Nothing.
We' re just having a little dinner.
A little dinner?
With this diet, Tabitha will have the gout by the time she's five.
Hi, sweetheart.
Samantha, this child is just skin and bones.
She is not.
You get rid of all this stuff.
Very well.
Thank you.
And take the spell off Darrin right now.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
I forgot all about Durwood.
I' II go to work and reverse the spell.
- Thank you.
- You' re very welcome.
Daddy and I will be back on Tuesday.
I'm sure there' II be no reason for me to pop back before that.
No reason at all.
Now, all right, Tabitha.
Tabitha, come on and eat your dinner, dull as it is.
Sam, Larry and Garcia will be here in a moment, and the spell is still on!
Mother promised she would get rid of it by using a reverse-the-spell spell.
Reverse-the-spell spell?
This is ridiculous.
Well, try it again.
Say something in Spanish.
Hallelujah.
I'm saved!
She reversed the spell, all right.
Well, now, sweetheart, try and look at the bright side.
I mean, you have to make your speech in Spanish anyway so just don't speak any English and stick to Spanish.
I'm sure Mother meant well.
Well, I'm sure that this time, it was just an honest mistake.
Sweetheart, I' II pop back home and see what Oh, boy.
Excuse me.
I have to change.
Good evening, Sam.
Darrin.
Oh, fine, Mr. Stephens.
You were quite right about changing the name to Zap.
It was a brilliant and logical solution.
How long would it take to work out a presentation on Zap?
A week, more or less.
Isn't this a bit silly?
My speaking English to you, and you speaking Spanish to me?
You' re embarrassing your host.
Oh, no, he just wants to be totally immersed in Spanish.
Of course.
But some friends of mine from the States who are interested in securing the North American franchises will be at the banquet.
Although they understand Spanish, still try to put in enough English so they won't feel left out.
All right?
Won't that make it a little difficult for the Mexican group?
Oh, not at all.
My associates are quite comfortable with your language.
Well, let us be on our way.
- Oh, boy.
- Darrin.
Darrin, now, you have nothing to worry about.
Just give all your speech in Spanish and do exactly what I tell you, huh?
Now, start the speech by addressing the Mexican group.
Then, when you turn to talk to the American group l' II toss in a little translation spell.
They' II hear you in English.
When you turn back to the Mexican group I' II zap them, and they' II hear you in Spanish.
It' II never work.
Just keep turning back and forth like a lighthouse.
Like everyone else, he' II hear part in English and part in Spanish.
Considering the way he's acted, he' II hear the whole thing in Spanish.
Serve him right.
What's going on?
Do you know you' re driving me right out of my skull?
And now, my friends my Norte American friends and my fellow Mexican countrymen Mr. Darrin Stephens will now say a few brief words to us in Spanish and in English.
I'm happy to be here with you, but please forgive I know you all have great respect for the name To give it an enviable place in the hearts and the stomachs of his countrymen.
Please, excuse Stephens.
He's blown his mind.
I think the way he switches back and forth from English to Spanish is wonderful.
To the American market with an American name.
To assure you a great success.
Wonderful.
Remarkable.
I didn't hear any English at all.
That's because you did not pay attention.
You must be very tired again.
I must be.
My friends, I think we can safely entrust our future in the hands of Mr. Stephens of McMann and Tate.
Do you agree?
Say something in English.
No, no, no.
I have a hunch.
Say, "I apologize".
I apologize.
- Why didn't I think of that before?
- What?
Well, that's all Mother wanted, was an apology.
Why didn't she say so?
Well, you know Mother.
Yeah, I know your mother.
She's every inch of a mother-in-law.
Darrin, you had me worried there for a while.
I guess I couldn't understand what was going on.
But they seemed to like it.
