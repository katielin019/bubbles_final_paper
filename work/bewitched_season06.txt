{START OF EPISODE 01}
James or Susan?
James or Susan?
Darrin!
We have to settle on a name.
Sam, how many times have I told you, never talk in the middle of somebody's backswing?
Sorry.
Okay, okay.
Now, what was it you asked me?
- I said we have to settle on a name.
- We did last night.
James if it's a boy and Susan if it's a girl.
Yeah, I know, but I thought it over, and I've changed my mind.
I don't want to settle on just any old name.
It should be something romantic.
How about Romeo if it's a boy and Juliet if it's a girl?
Darrin, either help me find a name or go play golf.
Okay, okay.
How about Scott or Timothy?
You'll be disappointed if it isn't a boy, won't you?
- Don't be silly.
- Yes, you will.
All men want a little boy so they can see themselves walking around.
Okay, let's concentrate on boys' names.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- I decided I don't want a brother.
- Well, maybe it'll be a little sister.
- But you said it would be a baby brother.
No, I didn't, sweetheart, not really.
That's something we won't know till after it's born.
Don't you like little girls any more?
Oh, sweetheart, of course we do.
We love little girls.
We were just trying to think up a boy's name in case it's a boy.
I understand.
Some people like boys better than girls.
- What do you think?
- Dr Spock we're not.
Hey, what did you do that for?
I'm Tabitha, and I want to talk to somebody.
Hey!
You shouldn't have done that.
- What's your name?
- Can't you even read?
I'm Jack, and that's a beanstalk, and I gotta climb it.
- Why?
- Because that's the story.
Girls sure are dumb.
I guess that's why my mommy and daddy want a boy, 'cause they're smarter.
We're not so smart.
You should've seen the dopey thing I did yesterday.
My mom gave me the old cow to sell 'cause we're poor.
I sold it to the butcher for a bag of magic beans.
Did I ever get it?
Wow!
- Do you have a daddy?
- Nope, never had one.
Well, I better get back on that stupid beanstalk.
I got an awful long way to climb and I'm just pooped.
- Would you like a daddy?
- Sure, what kid wouldn't?
Then you can have mine.
You'd like my daddy.
He plays golf and everything.
- Golf?
What's that?
- I don't know, but my daddy will teach you.
- But suppose your folks don't like me.
- I told you.
They like boys better than girls.
And I never climbed a beanstalk before.
Bye.
Hey, where'd you go?
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
- Here I am!
- Come on off of there!
- I want to see what's on the top.
- But there's a giant on the top.
Goody!
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Tabitha's just like any other kid.
Almost.
I mean, well, she'll brood for a while and then accept it.
I hope.
That's what I like, a man of strong convictions.
- Oh, hi, Mother.
- Hello, darling.
Endora, have you ever thought of knocking?
- Would that make you feel better?
- Yes.
Very well.
That's disgusting.
Now, Durwood, why don't you take your ball and bat and go do whatever it is you do with them?
It's not a bat.
It's a club.
And if I did with it what I wanted to do with it Darrin.
- Sounds like my mother.
- Sounds like a dreary Sunday.
I just remembered I have a pressing engagement that I have to iron out.
Oh, I'm such a wit!
Well, at least we know now how to get rid of her.
Sweetheart, why don't you let your mother in?
I want to check on Tabitha.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hello, Darrin.
Glad you dropped in.
What'd you drop in about?
Does a mother need a reason to visit her son?
Tabitha?
Hi.
- Who are you?
- Jack.
- Jack who?
- Just Jack.
I don't think I have a last name.
- Where's Tabitha?
- Climbing that dumb beanstalk.
Jack!
Jack and the Beanstalk!
Good grief, she zapped you out of a fairy tale!
She did something.
Anyhow, here I am.
How do you like me?
I beg your pardon?
Tabitha said you like boys better than girls, and I'm a boy.
- That's not true.
- I am so a boy!
No.
No, I mean, it's not true that we don't like her.
We love her.
- Does that mean you don't want me?
- Yes.
I mean, no.
I mean Oh, my stars!
Sam.
Sam, Mother would like to see Who is that?
Jack.
I'm pleased to meet you, sir.
How do you do?
Where's Tabitha?
- Tabitha is - Out.
Sam, what's going on?
Tabitha.
Tabitha, come give Grandma a great, big Where's Tabitha?
- Tabitha is - Out.
Out where?
- Climbing a - Fence at a neighbour's house.
- Who is this?
- Jack.
- A friend.
- What odd clothes.
Yes.
Yes, they're junior mod.
It's all the rage.
What's golf?
- Tabitha said you'd teach me.
- Teach you?
Sure, sure.
Mother, why don't you go downstairs and make yourself a cup of tea?
Oh, thank you.
Would you like some milk and cookies, young man?
- He's not hungry.
- Yes, I would, ma'am.
Come along then.
Darrin, you get down there this minute and don't take your eyes off him.
No, wait a minute.
Better yet, why don't you go out and play golf?
Mother and I'll handle this.
Sam, where is Tabitha, and who is that dopey-looking kid?
- Tabitha's playing, and he's Jack.
- I know he's Jack.
Where is Tabitha?
Well She ran away from home, sort of.
Now, how do you "sort of" run away from home?
Instead of walking out a door, you just climb up a beanstalk.
A what?
- A - No.
No.
Don't repeat it.
A beanstalk.
Jack and the Beanstalk.
Why?
Because she thinks we like boys better than girls.
Because Well, I'm not sure why.
Sweetheart, you trust me.
I'll get her back.
Now, why don't you go downstairs and keep an eye on Jack?
- Sam?
- Yoo-hoo, sweetheart.
Here I am.
- Sam, come back.
- I'll be right back.
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
"Giant's Castle, trespassers welcome".
They sure are, especially at lunchtime.
- You startled me.
- You put a fright in me, too.
You don't belong in this story.
Who are you?
No, don't tell me.
You're one of them witches.
Something like that, but I'll only stay a minute.
Stay as long as you like.
It's a change to have someone new to talk to now and then.
Well, I haven't got much time for talk.
I'm looking for a little girl, blonde, about so high.
Never saw her.
The only kid I know is Jack.
- You must be the giant's wife.
- Of course I'm the giant's wife.
But don't envy me married to that big goof.
If he's not counting his treasure, he's eating himself into a stupor.
- Ma'am - And the things he puts into his stomach, - it's a wonder he don't have indigestion.
- Ma'am, I Do you know what my grocery bill was for this week alone?
- Ma'am, if you'll just tell me - I am telling you, 1,000 gold crowns.
If a couple of trespassers didn't wander into the castle now and then, - it would be twice that much.
- Ma'am, I really have to find my daughter.
If I'm not shopping for food, I'm bent over a hot stove cooking food, while he's fee-fi-fo-fumming all over the place.
Excuse me.
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Okay, okay.
If you want to be his midmorning snack, just keep heading for the castle.
Tabitha?
Pardon me.
May I see the giant, please?
No.
He don't see nobody unless his name is Jack.
Pardon me.
Are you a giant?
I am not a giant.
I am the giant!
And who in tarnation are you?
My name is Tabitha.
There's no Tabitha in this story.
- There is now.
Do you know why?
- Yes, because you're a witch.
No, 'cause I ran away from home on account of my mommy and daddy are having a baby brother.
- That's why.
- Oh, it's a very charming tale of woe.
There's absolutely nothing I can do about it.
I don't adopt children, I only eat them!
I know.
Are they delicious?
They can be quite tasty at times.
- Are you going to eat me?
- What are you, some kind of nut?
You don't like me either.
I'm a mean, evil giant, for pity's sake.
I don't like anybody.
My mommy says I'm delicious, all sugar and spice and everything nice.
You're making my mouth water.
No, thank you.
I couldn't swallow another bite.
Besides, I'm only allowed to eat storybook children.
Now, please go!
What's that?
That's my magic harp and my hen who lays the golden eggs.
- Can I play with them?
- No, you can't!
I'm a very busy giant, little girl.
So vamoose!
Fee, fi, fo, fum.
I smell the blood of an Englishman!
I know a poem, too.
"Mary had a little lamb" Will you be quiet and let me get on with the story?
- That rascal Jack will be here any minute.
- No, he won't.
He's living in my house.
Nonsense.
He comes into the castle on the next page.
- He won't.
- Will.
- Won't.
- Will!
Listen, kid, I've been living this story for 100 years.
Jack always comes by at this time to try to rob me of my treasure.
Can't I rob you instead?
No, you can't!
It would change the whole story!
Now get lost!
- I am lost.
- Oh, boy.
Now, listen, little girl, I am about to lose my temper!
If you lose your temper, I'll make a no-no at you.
- Here we are.
- Thank you, ma'am.
Where's Samantha?
She went out front for a while to pick some flowers, so to speak.
You poor, starved darling.
You look as though you hadn't eaten in a week.
I haven't, not since I sold the cow.
You had a cow in this neighbourhood?
So you want to learn how to play golf, huh, Jack?
She went dry on us.
And yes, I do, sir.
Swell, swell.
Here, put that right down there.
You see, the secret to the game is in the overlapping grip.
Please, Darrin, I'm trying to understand the child.
- So you sold a cow - To the butcher for a mess of magic beans.
- Magic beans?
- Which grew into a tall beanstalk.
And the second secret is to keep your mouth shut when addressing the ball.
It seems to me I've heard that story before.
Speaking of heard, I think I heard Samantha upstairs.
So I climbed up the beanstalk - I'm getting a sick headache.
- I'll get you something.
And at the top of the beanstalk, there's a giant.
Make it the extra-strength tablets.
Sam?
Sam, come home.
Come home!
Relax, Darwin.
Relax.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for your mother and that grubby little boy to leave.
Do you have any idea what's going on down there?
Certainly, I peeked.
It's a rerun of Jack and the Beanstalk in living colour.
That kid is going to drive my mother crazy.
Yes?
Endora, couldn't you just once do something constructive?
- Like what?
- Like finding Sam and Tabitha.
- Aren't you concerned about them?
- Oh, certainly not.
As a child I used to zap myself into literature at the drop of a hat.
Of course, I was more precocious.
I know I had this mad thing for Hamlet.
And one day, I changed places with Ophelia.
I had a delightful time confusing my nurse.
Oh, no.
That was the time I played Juliet.
Oh, never mind.
I'll read about it in your memoirs.
Right now zap yourself onto that beanstalk and bring them back.
Climb a beanstalk in my Lili Arlege original?
Are you mad?
- Endora, their lives may be in danger.
- Oh, fiddle-de-dah.
Any child that can zap herself into a fairy tale can zap herself right out of it.
- Who be you?
- I be I mean, I'm looking for a little girl about so high.
I'm her mother.
- Named Tabitha?
- Yes, yes.
- You will pay for her no-nos.
- What did she do?
You should be ashamed to raise such a wicked little girl.
Go!
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
All right, Tabitha, playtime is over.
I do not intend to spend an entire Sunday in a dungeon.
Ma'am, I'm taking my life in my hands coming here, but I've seen enough trouble for one day.
Take my advice, run, do not walk, to the nearest exit.
I don't intend to leave without my daughter.
If I find her, I'll put her on the beanstalk personally and send her home, the rotten kid.
- What has she done?
- What has she done?
Lay.
The hen that laid the golden egg, right?
She wanted an omelette for breakfast.
Wait.
My husband, the giant's magic harp.
Play.
Stop!
The only thing that will soothe his savage breast is Chopin, and she gives him the Rolling Stones.
Fee, fi, fo, fum.
And if you think that's bad, wait'll you see what she did to him.
I smell the blood of an Englishman!
That's a giant?
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh.
They're all laughing at me, the townsfolk, my manservants, my guards, even my wife.
- I only snickered once.
- I'm sure she didn't mean to do it.
Nice children have respect for their elders.
Nice elders don't threaten to eat little children.
I've been frightening kids for 100 years.
And look at me now, cut down in me prime.
In my eyes, you'll always be a giant.
Oh, shut up!
Shut up?
Shut up?
Listen, small fry, say "shut up" to me again, and I'll squash you under my heel like an ant!
Even she doesn't respect me any more!
- Mommy, Mommy.
- Tabitha.
- You put her in chains?
- She insisted.
They're fun, Mommy.
There is nothing fun or funny about running away, young lady.
- I'm sorry, Mommy.
- "Sorry," she said, after what she did to an innocent giant.
Please, sir, we'll stretch you back to size.
Go on, Tabitha.
But, Mommy, he's easier to play with this way.
- I don't want to play with you.
- You do as I say, young lady.
No!
Spunky little kid, ain't she?
Tabitha, you're a little witch, but I'm a bigger witch, so if you don't I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
I'm a giant again!
A giant!
Fee, fi, fo, fum!
Now the hen and the harp.
Now, if you'll excuse us You'll squash who under whose heel?
So I hid in the castle until the giant fell fast asleep.
And I snuck up behind him, and I grabbed the hen and ran as fast as my little feet could carry me.
This poor child is having a nervous breakdown.
He is?
He is, he is.
That's it.
It's from malnutrition.
He needs help.
- Where'd he go?
- Maybe he went to get some help.
And I think I heard Samantha upstairs.
And I think I'm getting another sick headache.
- I'll get you another pill.
- And the address of a qualified psychiatrist.
Now, sweetheart, I know it's hard for you to understand, but Daddy and I have enough love in us for both you and the new baby.
But you haven't seen the baby yet.
Maybe it will look funny and you won't like it.
If it looks funny, we'll love it all the more.
Then I hope it looks pretty, because I want you to love me all the more.
Okay.
It's a deal.
Now go to sleep.
How'd your woman-to-woman talk go?
- Just fine.
She's okay now.
- Good.
How's your mother?
Well, she's a little shook-up, but she'll be all right.
Darrin?
- There's one thing that really puzzles me.
- What's that?
That you're not sorry you married me.
Between this big witch and the little witch upstairs and that witch of a mother of mine, you're really up to your neck in witches.
That's a fair statement, and I'd be lying if I didn't say there are times when I wonder if it's all worth it.
Of course, there are other times when I realise I couldn't live without you.
I'll admit that's almost all the time.
I love you and that little witch upstairs.
And Mother?
Well, two out of three.
That's not bad.
Darrin.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Four creamed corn, two pickled onions, two stewed tomatoes, four diced pomegranates What's all this?
I ordered everything early hoping I'd get it out of the way.
If you sit down, I'll fix breakfast.
What would you like?
Where would you suggest I sit?
Sorry.
Here, I'll get it.
Okay.
Who did that?
It wasn't Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.
Endora, would you mind giving us a little warning when you're gonna drop in?
All right.
I'm dropping in.
Fine.
Now would you mind dropping out?
- Not at all.
- Darrin.
Mother, dear, would you please come back?
I do wish you'd make up your minds.
Samantha, I no longer can permit you to go on doing these menial chores just because El Cheapo refuses to hire a maid.
Tell me, Endora, what was it like at the Tower of Babel?
One more word out of you, and I'll turn you into a mushroom.
Poisonous, of course.
As a matter of fact, Samantha, I have found a maid for you.
A perfect gem named Esmeralda, and she's not an outsider.
Oh, no.
One thing we desperately don't need around here is another witch.
If you'll stop braying for a minute and listen, I'll tell you why I think you'll find Esmeralda acceptable.
She's never been terribly secure, and lately she's lost her confidence along with most of her powers.
What she wants now is a safe, snug little harbour.
Then let her turn herself into a boat.
Darrin, maybe Mother's come up with the answer this time.
I mean, with the new baby coming, we do need some extra help, and Esmeralda not being much of a witch isn't like having another witch in the house at all.
Sort of.
- Forget it.
- Too late.
That's Esmeralda.
Well, now Now, wait a minute.
There's nobody here.
- Hello, Endora.
- Hello, Esmeralda.
- I hope I'm not too early.
- Oh, no.
Your timing is perfect.
Come in.
Come on in.
This is my daughter Samantha.
And this is him, the mortal I told you about.
How do you do?
Now, there's nothing to be nervous about.
- Maybe not for her.
- You know, when she gets tense, she fades.
- Of course.
- Esmeralda, it's nice to meet you.
See?
He's not going to bite you.
Now, why don't you just relax, Esmeralda?
Come on into the living room, Esmeralda.
Samantha, your mother's got to be kidding.
Now, sweetheart, just try to be a little more understanding.
She's thinking of my welfare, like any other mother.
Yeah?
Show me another mother who hires an invisible maid.
Well, she's only trying to be helpful.
Okay.
How about this?
Show me another mother who sharpens her teeth in the morning.
Well!
Believe me, Esmeralda, you'll love working here.
Mother was right.
We do need some help.
What do we have to lose?
For one thing, our minds.
Esmeralda.
Now, admit it.
That could be very difficult to explain in mixed company.
Once she relaxes, it won't happen.
Besides, who's gonna take care of you and Tabitha while I'm in the hospital?
Oh, it's all right.
We don't even know if she's had any experience.
Well, let's find out.
Esmeralda, we'd like to ask you a few questions.
Have you had any experience?
Well, as a matter of fact, no.
I've never even been married.
She means experience keeping house.
Esmeralda, what we're trying to find out is have you had any experience helping out in a family?
Well, I should say I have.
Really?
Where?
At Tudor Castle in England.
Yes.
I was a lady-in-waiting.
You know, just for a lark.
But believe me, it was no lark.
The master had terrible eating habits.
Ate with his hands and threw his food all over the place.
And every couple of months there'd be a new mistress, sometimes a new wife.
Is she Are you talking about Henry Vlll?
Well, I don't remember his number, but I certainly remember him.
Sam.
We'll be right back.
Pay no attention to him, Esmeralda.
He's a low-grade mortal.
Hello, Grandmamma.
Hello, Tabitha.
Oh, my precious little lady.
Say hello to Esmeralda.
- Hello, Esmeralda.
- What a little jewel she is.
- She looks just like her mother.
- Yes.
- And her father.
- Bite your tongue.
Esmeralda?
- We've come to a decision.
- You have?
Esmeralda!
Come back here.
Come back here, right away.
Esmeralda, we want you to stay, and we hope you'll be happy.
Oh, thank you.
I'm sure I will be.
Well, now that that's settled, you'd better run along, Durwood.
We don't want you to be late for doing whatever it is you do.
You seem awfully anxious to get rid of me.
Why should today be different than any other day?
Endora, when it comes to being a pain in the As a matter of fact, I have the layouts for Hampton Motors here and I can work on those.
I'll call Larry and tell him I'm gonna work at home.
Anything you say, sweetheart.
Cuckoo.
Samantha, hadn't you better take Esmeralda upstairs and just show her around?
Of course.
Come along, Tabitha.
Go with Esmeralda.
Hi, Larry.
I think I can work better at home today.
It's quiet here and I won't be bothered by phone interruptions and things like that.
So if you don't mind, Larry, I think I'll just stay here and work on those layouts for Hampton Motors.
Okay, that'll be fine.
- What time will you be in?
- About noon, okay?
Noon?
What do you think we're running here, a rest-and-recreation centre?
Larry, what's the difference whether I work here or at the office?
What's the difference?
I'll tell you what the difference is.
Never mind what the difference is.
But, Larry Here we are in the middle of a crisis, and you want to stay home and loaf.
Crisis?
What crisis?
You just get yourself down here, buddy boy, and you'll find out.
Sam, I've gotta run.
I thought you were gonna work at home.
Well, I thought it over, and I decided it'd be better to go to the office.
Bye, Endora.
If you're not here when I get back, I certainly hope so.
That's funny.
I didn't think so.
No, I mean, why he changed his mind about working at home.
It's just as well.
I'd rather he wasn't around in case Esmeralda's witchcraft acts up.
You said she'd lost most of her powers.
She has, she has, but she's still subject to what you might call involuntary witchcraft.
It happens mainly when she sneezes.
What happens?
Get the picture?
Nothing happened upstairs.
Did anything happen down here?
Oh, dear.
Now what do we do?
Lower the furniture or raise the floor?
Don't worry.
The spell won't last.
Nothing ever does with me.
The worst part is I never know what I'm going to get.
Oh, I wish I could get rid of this I haven't had a tree in a long time.
Well, it's been a long time since we've had a tree, too, especially in the living room.
Esmeralda, why don't you go back upstairs and relax?
You're much too tense.
- I'll try.
- Wait a minute.
What about the tree?
Oh, don't worry.
It'll go away eventually.
Well, I hope it goes away before autumn.
Otherwise we'll have to pay the gardener extra to rake up the living room.
- Mother, this isn't going to work out.
- Of course it is.
Give her time.
I can only give her until the time Darrin comes home.
Darrin, I was afraid you'd left already.
He's here, Mr Hampton.
Come on in.
- Well, hello there, Stephens.
How are you?
- Fine, thanks, but I didn't think you were coming in till next week, Mr Hampton.
I'm just in for the day to attend a wedding.
Thought I'd stop by and see how you were doing.
How's it coming?
Fine.
Fine.
Mr Hampton was wondering if he could get a peek at the layouts.
I haven't got them here.
They're home.
What a shame.
- I can bring them in tomorrow.
- No, I have to get back to Detroit tonight.
No problem.
We can just drive out to Stephens's place.
- Well, that'll be great.
- Let's go.
- Well, Larry, wait.
I can't go.
- Why not?
Because, well, we've got this new maid, and Sam asked me to stay out of the way until this evening.
She's a real ding-a-ling.
- Sam?
- The maid.
We're just going to get those layouts and go.
As a matter of fact, the layouts aren't ready.
Mr Hampton knows that.
He just wants to see the work in progress.
I especially want to see what you've got on the new economy car.
- Let's go.
We can talk on the way.
- Larry With all due respect, I don't think it's fair to ask me to show unfinished work.
Is that a perfectionist for you?
I tell you, this boy has principles.
Pride of accomplishment.
Qualities we at McMann & Tate encourage and admire.
Darrin, Mr Hampton, our client wants to see what you have, finished or not.
So let's go.
Mr Hampton.
Thank you.
Hurry up.
Hurry up, make a move.
Don't take all day.
- How you doing?
- Checkmate.
Mother, pull yourself together.
Feeling better after your nap?
Oh, yes.
What a luxury.
- Where's Esmeralda?
- She's out on the patio playing with Tabitha.
Mother?
Has she Has anything happened?
I haven't heard a sneeze out of her since you went upstairs.
"And then the prince bent over and kissed the princess, "and she opened her eyes and she smiled".
- Did a prince ever kiss you?
- No.
I was almost kissed by a king, but I sneezed right in the middle of it.
It took them two days to find him.
And then And then Oh, my goodness.
Puff, the Magic Pony.
- Oh, Mrs Stephens?
- Yes, Esmeralda.
Do you like animals?
Look, Mommy, a funny pony.
There's nothing funny about it.
Oh, it's divine.
And it's not a pony.
It's a unicorn, and they don't exist any more.
Why not?
Well, you remember I told you about Noah's Ark?
The unicorns missed the boat.
I've been meaning to ask you, Stephens.
You still negative about the name for the new economy car?
No, I think Cheetah has impact.
- It certainly says speed and grace.
- It sure does.
The only thing is there's an image confusion relating to cheating.
That doesn't mean that he doesn't love it.
I had my boys in research check it out, and they agree with you.
It doesn't test well.
Something about the name Cheetah always bothered me.
We'd better give some thought to another name.
Well, here's one I was toying with, Coyote.
- Fast, light, sure.
- Good, good.
- Bad image.
- Bad, bad.
Oh, swell.
- And he's brought company.
- Sam?
Mother, are you just gonna stand there and do nothing?
Oh, no.
As a matter of fact, I think the whole affair has become a crashing bore.
- So, if you'll excuse me.
- Wait a What a talent your mother has.
You stay right here, all three of you.
Sam?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
- Everything okay?
- Super.
Good.
Good.
Mr Hampton, may I introduce my wife, Samantha.
- How do you do, Mr Hampton?
- How do you do?
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
Excuse us for barging in.
I hope we're not interrupting anything.
Larry, you know you're always a welcome interruption.
I'll go in the den and get those layouts.
I'll just be a minute.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Darrin, can I help?
- It's not necessary.
- Yes, it is.
Fix yourself a drink, Larry.
- Don't mind if I do.
Have a seat.
- Oh, thank you.
- You're bourbon and soda, right?
- Right.
I'm no good at names, but I never forget a drink.
The important thing is to get them out of here as soon as possible.
- We can argue about how it happened later.
- I'd just like to know who to be sore at.
You know, if we could only latch on to another name for that car.
We'll come up with something.
We always do.
- Tate?
- Yeah?
I I'm up in the air.
Well, that's understandable.
But I guarantee you, we'll have everything locked up in time for the campaign.
Tate?
What is it?
You look a little shook-up.
You better come out on the patio, get some fresh air.
Larry?
What are you going out there for?
To get some fresh air.
Mr Hampton was feeling a little shaky.
What a shame.
Why don't you take him in the den so he can lie down?
Good idea.
The air is better in there.
What have you got in there, an oxygen tent?
No, no, I'm all right now.
What about those layouts?
The layouts?
Oh, yes, the layouts.
Well, why don't we look at them in the den, too?
The light's better in there, too.
Darrin, first chance we get, let's sit down and talk about a little vacation for you.
Daddy, don't you want to see my funny pony?
Look.
What's that?
Wait a minute.
It didn't help.
It looks like a unicorn.
Well, if it doesn't, we've certainly wasted a lot of time.
- Right, Sam?
- Right.
Right.
A lot of time.
Well, we're sorry to spring it on you like this, Mr Hampton, but we wanted you to get the full impact.
Right?
Right.
And I think we got an even bigger impact than we expected.
Gentlemen, I present the name and symbol for Hampton's new economy car, The Unicorn.
The Unicorn?
For a car?
"The legendary car from Hampton".
Legendary car.
"Hampton Motors brings a myth to life".
Don't forget my favourite, "The car with the unique horn".
"Unique horn"?
Uni-corn.
- Well, what do you think?
- Sensational.
What a name for a car.
But how did you Well, I mean - Where did this come from?
- Well Well, it really wasn't that much of a trick.
You find yourself a white pony, and a lot of glitter, and some papier-mâché, and presto.
That's it.
Presto.
Well, I certainly have to admire your enterprise, Stephens.
Well, I'm gonna take the next plane back to Detroit and feed this to the research boys.
Good.
Come on, Darrin.
We ought to drive Mr Hampton to the airport.
Certainly been a pleasure meeting you, Mrs Stephens.
When I get back, I hope to find a few things missing around here.
Oh, dear.
- One down, one to go.
- Darrin.
Don't you pay any attention to him.
Sam?
- Sam?
- Yes, sweetheart.
Hi.
- They're lovely.
- They're from Hampton.
I met the delivery boy outside.
He says, "Dear Mrs Stephens, "thank you for your help in the campaign and sorry for the intrusion".
How nice.
Sam, about the Before you say anything, I want you to know the unicorn is gone.
That's good news.
Where is Esmeralda?
- She's gone, too.
- That's even better news.
I made an arrangement with her.
She's agreed to be sort of a "yoo-hoo" maid.
- A what?
- Oh, you know.
Instead of being here all the time, whenever we want her, we just yell.
Watch.
Esmeralda?
Yoo-hoo!
Yes, ma'am?
There you are.
Would you please put these in some water?
What lovely - Bless you.
- Bless us.
- What are you looking for?
- Nothing.
Esmeralda, it looks as if you may be cured.
- Wouldn't that be a blessing?
- Cured?
- Mommy!
- Yes, Tabitha, what is it?
- What do you feed an elephant?
- Why do you ask, dear?
Because there's one in my room.
Oh, dear.
Do you want to explain about the elephant?
No.
Good.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
- Mommy, I'm full.
- All right, sweetheart.
Just finish your milk.
Then can I have a piece of candy?
Tabitha, you know the rule.
If you have room for candy, you can finish your lunch.
But I only have a little room.
It's just big enough for candy.
Please, Mommy, just for a special treat.
Sorry, young lady.
But we're both gonna have a special treat.
Daddy's coming home for lunch.
Oh, goody!
Daddy will give me some candy.
- Oh, dear.
- It was a accident, Mommy.
Yes, of course.
Your father's gonna be home any second, and I don't have lunch anywhere near ready.
- Can I help, Mommy?
- No, sweetheart.
But I know who can.
Esmeralda.
Yoo-hoo, Esmeralda.
Yes, Mrs Stephens?
- Hi, Esmeralda.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Esmeralda, you don't have anything to be nervous about.
- Is Mr Stephens home?
- No.
- Good.
- But he'll be here any minute.
Goodbye.
Esmeralda, you're being very foolish.
Mr Stephens likes you.
A lot.
It's just that Well, he gets a little upset when you fade out.
And I really do need your help right now.
All right.
What do you want me to do?
Well, will you take Tabitha upstairs and change her?
Why, sure.
Who do you want me to change her into?
I mean change her dress.
I know what.
Do you know how to make a caesar salad?
I certainly do.
Good.
Well, you do that.
I'll take care of Tabitha.
Now, the lettuce is all washed, and everything you need's right on the sink.
Come on, sweetheart.
What a mess.
Why don't we change that upstairs?
Caesar salad.
It should be easy.
Ibbity, bibbity, salad greens, oil, vinegar, ceci beans, I call on Caesar's eternal soul, here and now to fill this bowl.
Don't tell me.
You're Caesar, right?
What manner of place is this?
How came I here?
I don't know how came you here.
The important thing is how do I get rid of you?
Sam?
I'm home.
Oh, dear.
I, Caesar, command you to reappear!
Your Excellency.
- How do you do that?
- I don't do it.
It just happens when things go wrong.
Does it happen very often?
A lot.
Can you tell your emperor what he's doing here?
No, I can't, but as long as you're here, could I interest you in making a caesar salad?
A what?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Hungry?
- Starved.
Good.
How come Larry let you off in the middle of the day?
What do you mean?
I can come and go as I please.
I don't need his permission for everything I do.
- Okay, okay.
- Besides, he's in Chicago.
- My, you're in a good mood today.
- Why not?
I've got a lovely wife, a beautiful daughter, a new baby on the way And a maid that walks around the house without any body.
Esmeralda, I told you there was nothing to be nervous about.
That's what you think.
Sam, would you mind warning me when she's in the house?
Mrs Stephens, could you come into the kitchen for a minute?
You get that.
I'll get the catastrophe.
Esmeralda, come back here!
All right.
Hello.
Larry!
Where are you?
Never mind where I am.
What are you doing home in the middle of the day?
Esmeralda, I'm sure it's not as awful as you think.
- Who's that?
- Caesar.
I got him instead of the salad.
That's awful!
See?
I told you.
Darrin, I'll be at your house in 15 minutes.
We've got work to do.
But, Larry Sam, I don't want to rush you, but Larry will be What What's this?
It's not a "what".
It's a "who".
I'm afraid it's all my fault.
This is Mr Stephens.
- Hi.
- Hail.
Darrin, that is Julius Caesar.
Why not?
I mean, sure.
I mean, if you have a maid that fades out, why not Julius Caesar in your kitchen?
Darrin, Esmeralda's gonna send him back as soon as she can remember how she got him here.
In the meantime, it's a marvellous opportunity to meet one of the great men of history and learn about his life and times.
Sam, in the first place, I read the play.
And in the second place, Larry will be here any minute.
- Now, look, Esmeralda, you've got - Enough of this babbling.
I demand to know where I am and how I came here.
Well, how you came here is a little difficult to explain.
Do you know what a witch is?
Someone with unusual powers?
Oh, yes.
A soothsayer.
Yes.
Well, Esmeralda is what you would call a soothsayer.
Let's face it.
I'm a lousy soothsayer.
I wouldn't say that.
- Why not?
- Well?
That's Larry.
Sam, do something.
I'll sneak him upstairs and put him in one of your suits for the time being.
Why go to all that trouble?
Roses are red, violets are blue, let his suit appear on you.
Boy, have I got a story to tell you.
And I'm sure you've got something to tell me.
Oh, you mean this.
This Well, everybody's wearing them.
It's a new kind of lounging outfit.
It's kind of Far-out, isn't it?
Not for somebody who wears gold leaves in their hair.
Oh, yeah.
Well, it goes with the outfit.
It's matched.
Would you excuse me, Larry, while I get into something less comfortable?
All right.
Who's the wise guy?
Oh, dear.
I might have known I couldn't do something right.
Will someone please remove these absurd clothes?
They are binding.
Sam, Larry thinks I've gone bananas.
Esmeralda, before you fade out, you have to fix this.
I'll try.
Reverse the curse.
It worked.
I'll try to get Larry into the den, and you keep him out of sight.
I've had nightmares that made more sense.
I find this all difficult to believe.
How do I know you're not in league with my enemies?
I have many enemies, you know.
Yes, I know.
Some of your best friends were enemies.
So when I found out that Evelyn Charday was going to be at this cocktail party at the hotel, I did everything I could to get invited.
- Oh, how did you get invited?
- I crashed.
Anyway, I met her.
And when she told me she was flying to New York today to line up a new agency, I dropped everything and hopped on the plane with her.
Why is she shopping for another agency?
Charday's come up with a new men's cologne called Top Tiger, which so far is a fabulous failure.
Anyway, we're having dinner with her at my house tonight.
Which gives you about six hours to map out a campaign so dazzling she'll fall into our arms.
Six hours?
Larry, I can't come up with anything decent in that time.
I don't even know the product.
Here's a bottle of Top Tiger.
Use it in good health.
Tonight.
And just for the record, in case it comes up, your wife is crazy about Charday Lizard Oil.
Come on.
I'll help you get started.
Maybe if you see it in black and white, you'll believe me.
There you are, under "Memorable Dates".
"Julius Caesar.
"Formed first triumvirate with Pompey and Crassus, 60 B.C. "Defeated Helvetii, 58 B.C. "Sent message to Roman Senate, 'Veni, vidi, vici.
' "I came, I saw, I conquered.
"Lived with Cleopatra in" Is nothing sacred?
"Was dictator of Rome" Dictator?
They dare to describe me thus?
I, Caesar, who refused the crown thrice?
This must be eradicated from the pages of history.
Where do I go to get this injustice rectified?
It's no use, Caesar.
You can't fight city hall.
I can.
I must.
I shall!
- Yeah, well - Sam?
Excuse me.
Listen, you better forget about me for lunch and dinner.
Have you gotten rid of Caesar?
No.
But you know something?
- It's really thrilling to listen to him.
- Sure.
"Caesar assassinated in Roman Senate by Brutus and Cassius".
Et tu, Cassius.
- Can you summon me a chariot?
- Are you joking?
I can't even make a caesar salad.
I must go to city hall and lodge a complaint.
Well, you could take a taxi.
- What, pray, is a taxi?
- It's a sort of horseless chariot.
All you have to do is go right through this door.
I thank you, Esmeralda.
Oh, no, no, Your Excellency.
I should be thanking you.
Mr and Mrs Stephens are going to be so happy when I tell them you've gone.
- Farewell.
- Bye, now.
And by the way, if anybody asks you, you're crazy about Charday's Lizard Oil.
It's supposed to keep you young.
Ever try it?
Me?
What for?
Sorry.
Lost my head.
- I wonder how Esmeralda's doing.
- Let's take a look.
- Where is he?
- He's gone.
- That's marvellous!
- And about time.
How did you manage to do it?
Simple.
I just opened the back door and out he walked.
- What?
- He said he had to go to city hall.
- Well, why did you let him go?
- You mean I shouldn't have?
Oh, now, Esmeralda, don't fade out.
You're the only one who can help us.
You look out front.
I'll check the back.
Darrin, here's a thought.
Wait a second, Sam.
If we invite Evelyn Charday here for dinner instead of my house, why, you could save the driving time and keep working on the campaign.
But, Larry, it's only five minutes to your house.
Yes, but with a thing like this, every minute counts.
- What sense does that make?
- A lot.
Louise didn't expect me back today.
She's having dinner with her mother.
- Fine.
Excuse me.
- I'll be right back.
- Any sign of him?
- No.
Sam, this could be disastrous.
Somebody's bound to find out who he is, - and how he got here, and - Sweetheart, just calm down.
You go back in the house and start working.
I'll get in the car and look for him.
At least I know where he's headed.
All right.
Here you are, Mac, city hall.
That's $2.40.
Hey, hey!
Wait!
Wait a minute.
- What kind of money is this?
- Those are Roman sesterces.
Yeah?
Well, if you ever get to Rome, they'll come in handy, but they're no good to me.
Hey, Officer!
- You mean gold is of no value here?
- Gold?
Gold?
All right, what's the trouble?
- What's the trouble?
- Trouble?
No trouble.
No trouble at all.
- Take care of my friend here, will you?
- Yeah.
You here for the demonstration?
Dig this far-out, beautiful person.
- Howdy, brother.
- Hail!
This is a nonviolent demonstration, pally.
We don't need no extremists here, you dig?
Now, why don't you just take one of these signs and join the march?
I did not come to march.
I came to protest.
And what do you think we're doing here?
Playing ring-around the rosie?
I wish to speak to the chief of the city.
You mean the Mayor.
Well, you can forget it, 'cause he already refused to see us.
He will not refuse me.
He said he's going to see the Mayor.
Now, that sounds official.
Let's follow him.
- And where do you think you're going?
- Inside.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- I order you to step aside.
Is that a fact?
Why don't you be a good buddy and get down off the steps?
You dare to touch the person of the imperator!
I just touched your toga.
Touching my toga is tantamount to touching my person.
Don't let him hassle you, brother.
All right, you asked for it.
I'm gonna take you in.
I'll have you fed to the lions.
- Oh, boy.
- Officer.
Please.
Let me explain.
I know this man, and he's sort of a stranger here.
- Well, he's certainly dressed for the part.
- You don't understand.
Well, why don't you try and explain it to me?
Will you please tell the officer who you are?
You mean he doesn't know?
I am Julius Caesar, Emperor of Rome.
Why don't you tell your friend that being a wise guy isn't going to help?
No, no, Officer, you don't get the point.
Not too many people go around dressed like that and call themselves Julius Caesar.
There is only one Caesar, and I am he.
- You mean - Exactly.
- How did he get loose?
- We weren't watching.
All right.
You can take him home.
Next time, try not to be so careless.
Thank you.
Come along, Julius.
You dare to touch - the person of the imperator?
- Yes, sorry.
Sorry.
All right, the rest of you, let's get off the steps.
Come on, move it off.
I will not put on that absurd costume.
But we've got company coming.
If they see you wandering around dressed like that, they're bound to ask questions.
Good.
I welcome an opportunity to explain how I have been maligned in your history books.
Boy, have you got a one-track mind.
Sam?
He won't put on the suit.
He won't even go upstairs.
Oh, well, that's all right.
We're working on another angle.
Esmeralda knows a spell to go back in time.
Now, Caesar was born in 102 B.C., so all she has to do is cast a spell to go back to 103 B.C. Oh, terrific.
But can you speed it up a little?
Our guests are due any minute.
Oh, dear.
Let me see if I can remember it.
Oh, yes.
One, two, buckle my shoe.
Three, four, close the door.
- Esmeralda?
- Five, six Yes?
That's a spell?
Well, it is if you hold an ostrich feather in one hand and the gizzard of a lizard in the other.
- Sorry I asked.
- Well, we'll just have to improvise.
Now, there's a bottle of lizard oil on Darrin's desk.
If we're lucky, it'll work.
They're here.
Now remember, whatever happens, he's not to come out.
- Sam, Darrin.
- Hi, Larry.
I'd like you to meet a lady who is a legend in her own time.
- Miss Evelyn Charday.
- Oh, really, Larry.
You're too much.
- Isn't he too much?
- Much too much.
Welcome to the club, Miss Charday.
We're all fans of Larry's.
- Come on in.
Have a drink.
- Oh, why, thank you.
Oh, my.
What a lovely home.
Caesar, return to days of yore.
Caesar, return to days of yore.
Listen, you're supposed to go back.
- Not until I can remove the blot on my name.
- Oh, dear.
What do you think?
Should we pitch our ideas for the campaign now or wait till after dinner?
- Well, that depends.
Do you have any ideas?
- Of course not.
I was counting on you.
Well, then let's wait till after dinner, maybe I'll think of something by then.
What?
- Well, here we are.
- How nice.
Thank you.
- Excuse me.
- Yes, of course.
- Larry?
- Oh, thank you, Darrin.
We have a problem, all right.
As long as he refuses to go back, the spell won't work.
You mean we're stuck with him forever?
We have to make him want to go back.
- Tempt him.
- Good idea.
- How?
- There's only one way I can think of.
- What's going on out there?
- Where?
In there?
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing at all.
And I think I'll take a look.
Caesar, for the last time, will you go back to the pages of history?
I refuse.
Very well.
I guess I'll just have to show you what you'll be missing if you don't go back.
- Cleopatra, my love.
- Julius, my conqueror.
Sam, my - What is the big idea?
- Well, I had to tempt him to go back.
Larry, when am I going to hear all those brilliant ideas for my new cologne?
Why - Wouldn't you rather wait until after dinner?
- No.
Let's go see what's going on in there.
I don't think you'll have any trouble with the spell now.
- 101, 102 - Listen, what's going on - Oh, Larry, you spoiled the whole thing.
- Oh, yes.
You spoiled it.
What'd he spoil?
The thing.
Oh, yes, the whole thing.
Darrin wasn't quite ready.
Were you, Darrin?
Oh, no.
Nowhere near ready.
Larry, you sly, grey fox, you led me right into this, didn't you?
Well, I We We wanted to spring it on you.
- Well, Darrin, spring it.
- Oh, yes.
Well Well, it's It's the first How can I put it?
It's the first in a series of full-page ads of great romances featuring Top Tiger cologne.
Personally, I love this idea.
Evelyn, now you've seen the picture, now for the caption.
"Top Tiger cologne, "the reason why Cleopatra let Julius seize her".
Oh, brother.
"Let Julius seize her".
Darrin, you have laboured and brought forth a mouse.
- That's absolutely marvellous!
- And what a mouse.
Darrin, you've done it again.
I have an idea for a caption.
"Put a tiger in your toga".
- How about serving dinner?
- Sure.
- Shall we?
- Larry, I must say you people have style.
- I think we're in business.
- Thank you.
Esmeralda, it's all yours.
So long, Caesar.
Hail and farewell!
And thanks.
- Sam?
- Yes, sweetheart?
Look at this.
"Cab driver receives fortune in old Roman coins from unidentified hippie".
That must be the cab driver who took Caesar downtown.
I don't know why he couldn't have dropped some of those old coins around here.
For Tabitha.
Considering he helped you get the Charday account, I think he did very well by you.
- How'd the meeting go?
- Like silk.
She flipped over the whole idea of a sales campaign based on great romances of history.
Speaking of great romances Incidentally, you asked me to warn you, so I am.
Esmeralda's still here.
She's recovering, sort of.
I hope you didn't give her anything too complicated to do.
Oh, no, sweetheart.
She's making a simple hearts of palm salad.
- All she has to do is open a can.
- Good.
Well, I guess I'll go upstairs and Sam!
Well, I guess I'll just have to face it.
With Esmeralda, nothing's simple.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
- Okay, I've got it all worked out.
- What's that?
The alternate plan in case I'm not here when it's time to go to the hospital.
What's wrong with calling a cab?
It's too unreliable.
They might not have one available, or the driver might have a hard time finding the address, or who knows what?
Now, the first one you call is Mr Lutkins next door, cause he's almost always home now that his wife is visiting her mother.
If by some chance he's not there, you're to call Mrs Grand down the block, but you let the phone ring for a while, because she spends a lot of time out in the rose garden.
Now if she's out, you try the Henrys, then the Goodalls, the Harpers and the Cushmans.
By the time I make all those calls, it may be too late to get to the hospital.
Never mind.
Just keep this list handy.
Any more of that chocolate cake left?
Sorry, sweetheart.
We finished the last of it at dinner.
I could eat another piece myself.
Honey, when you go to the doctor tomorrow for your checkup I thought you said there was no more chocolate cake.
- There wasn't.
- Well, what's that?
Chopped liver?
Darrin, I don't know where it came from.
You don't?
How about Absolutely not.
- Lf I had, I would've zapped it à la mode.
- Then where did it come from?
I don't know.
Maybe Mother sent it to me as a gift.
- You want half?
- I wouldn't dream of it.
After all, you're eating for two.
I'll just take a third.
Well, that's good.
You put on a little more weight.
I'll be losing some in a little while.
About seven or eight pounds, wouldn't you say?
Incidentally, I'm out of my pills.
It's a little late to start worrying about that, isn't it?
- Iron pills.
- Sorry.
I'll give you another prescription.
Darrin made arrangements with the neighbours to drive me to the hospital in case he wasn't home.
He'll be home.
None of my babies is ever born until after I've gone to bed, usually around 3:00 a.m. - By the way, what are you hoping for?
- A honeydew melon.
Odd.
Most people want a boy or a girl.
I'm sorry.
I just can't seem to keep my mind off food.
I get these terrible cravings.
Well, it is a little unusual this late, but it's probably psychological, because you didn't gain as much weight as we expected.
I guess so.
Well, it's nothing to worry about.
I had one patient who was on her way to the hospital, and she stopped off to buy a bag of apples.
I've been thinking about apples, too.
But candied ones.
Had it in my purse.
- Care for a bite?
- No, thank you.
With my wife it was chop suey.
She couldn't get enough of it.
Chop suey.
Say, that sounds good.
Let me have that prescription back, will you, Samantha?
I'd like to increase the dosage.
- Prescription?
- Yeah.
What have you got in that purse?
Just a little snack for emergencies.
Well, if your druggist can't read it, he can always eat it.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
- How'd it go at the doctor's?
- Fine.
Just fine.
He said it could be any day now.
I have another neighbour to add to that list.
I'll just write it down.
You have enough names on that list now to fill Madison Square Garden.
I'm just being cautious.
- What's in here?
- Just a little leftover chop suey.
Don't they put it in cartons any more?
Darrin, I might as well tell you.
Ever since yesterday, when I get a craving for food, - I get it.
- So what?
This is certainly the time when you should indulge yourself.
No.
No, no, sweetheart.
You don't understand.
I mean, when I get a craving, I don't go to it, it comes to me.
Well, Sam, this is terrible.
We've got to do something.
That's the first sensible thing you've ever said.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
- When did these cravings start, Samantha?
- Yesterday.
- Sam, what are you gonna do?
- Well, let's look at the bright side.
If I suddenly get a craving for something in the middle of the night, you don't have to go out and get it for me.
- This is nothing to kid about.
- What we have to do is get Dr Bombay.
Well, hurry, please, because Larry's coming over.
We're gonna work on the Paxton account.
While you're waiting for Bombay, maybe it might be a good idea if you went upstairs and took a nap or something.
- I'm not sleepy.
- Now, Sam, what are we gonna say if Larry's here and you suddenly get a yen for, I don't know, shish kebab?
I haven't had shish kebab in ages.
Sam!
There's only one thing to do.
- Call the fire department?
- Will you cut it out?
How do you know this isn't something serious?
That's Larry.
Get rid of that.
- How can I get rid of it?
- Try eating it.
- Hello, Larry.
- Hi, Darrin.
- Samantha.
Endora.
- Larry.
- Mr Tate.
- How nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Sam, you look positively radiant.
Thank you, Larry.
And that shish kebab doesn't look bad either.
Well, I suddenly got this craving for shish kebab, and Darrin was sweet enough to get it for me.
With Louise it was pizza.
With me it was hummingbird wings.
- I think I'll go upstairs and take a nap.
- Good idea!
You want to be looking your best for this afternoon.
Larry, about that cocktail party, I don't know whether we can make it.
What are you talking about?
You know the only reason I'm having the cocktail party is so we can pitch our ideas at Paxton.
- You remember him, don't you, Sam?
- How could I forget him?
We have enough of his detergent in our kitchen to start our own business.
Well, you made a big hit with him.
Larry, I know how badly you want his account, and I'll be there, but I'm not sure whether Sam can make it.
Darrin, I don't want to hurt your feelings, but if only one of you can make it, I'd rather have Sam.
I always said you were a man of taste and judgement.
Thank you.
Well, we'd better get cracking on that presentation.
Yes.
I've got the stuff in the den.
Will you get a hold of that quack Bombay?
I'll have you know, he's our most prominent witch doctor.
- Do you have to call him that?
- Yes.
Darrin.
So where is he?
Well, Mother's been trying to get in touch with him all day.
She says he's climbing the Matterhorn.
We should've left for Larry's 10 minutes ago.
Maybe we should just call Larry and tell him you're not feeling up to it.
Honey, why don't we take our chances?
I'll try not to think about food.
Well, what are we gonna say if food starts popping in from nowhere?
- I mean, how can we explain it?
- Chicken Delight?
You know, that Dr Bombay has no sense of responsibility.
I mean, if he's going away, why doesn't he leave another doctor on call?
Because, you silly boy, I happen to be irreplaceable.
Well, it's about time.
Hope you realise the sacrifice I made by coming here.
I was about to plunge my pennant in the peak.
Well, what's the trouble?
Dr Bombay, you see, I get these cravings for food and - What could be more normal?
Look at you.
- Would you let her finish?
When she has these cravings, the food comes to her.
Well, what's the problem?
Sounds rather convenient to me.
Well, it can be rather awkward, Dr Bombay.
I mean, if it happens in front of mortals, what will they say?
Nothing, if you turn them into monkeys.
Well, can you do anything about it or not?
I'll have to examine her first.
Sit down, my dear.
There we are.
Let's see.
Pardon me.
- What are you going to do?
- Check her blood pressure, of course.
Yeah.
Yes.
That's normal.
Just take your pulse.
Right shoe off.
Yes.
Well, perfectly obvious to me.
- What is it?
- You're pregnant.
Pregnant?
The gardener could've told us that.
You didn't tell me you had another man on the case.
Dr Bombay, please be serious.
We're late for a very important cocktail party.
- Is there a cure?
- Of course.
- What's that for?
- Nothing, but I love the sound.
- Sam, this is ridiculous.
- Also extremely painful.
Dr Bombay, please?
Very well.
But I should think, considering how far I've come, you wouldn't begrudge me a little levity.
Give her the cure and then you can laugh yourself sick.
Look close.
That's all?
Well, I could've worn a black hood and used a steaming cauldron, but you said you were in a hurry.
Don't you think we should test it?
I mean, to make sure it works?
Bombay never bombs out.
Just the same.
Sweetheart, what do you feel like eating right now?
Well, I could go for a corned beef sandwich.
Thank you, Dr Bombay.
I'm sorry if I was a little huffy.
Come on, sweetheart.
Get your mother to babysit, and then we can go.
Just one moment.
What about my fee?
- Well, what do you want?
- I want your soul.
What?
He's rather a square, isn't he?
Well, ta-ta.
Sam, when Dr Anton takes your blood pressure, - how does he do it?
- The normal way.
- Then why doesn't Bombay do it that way?
- Sweetheart, he just likes to be showy.
I'll admit he's a little bit difficult, but he's the only witch doctor we have.
I'm kind of sorry he cured me, though.
I really could go for a corned beef sandwich.
Sam?
Sam!
Corned beef sandwich, please.
Make it lean with lots of mustard.
Just put it on our account.
Hello.
Sam?
Where are you?
You're not going to believe this.
- Are you all right?
- Yes.
What's that Bombay done to you?
Wait.
Now if you just give me a chance, I'll explain.
Yeah, it Thank you.
Apparently he did reverse the spell, but instead of the food coming to me, I go to the food.
- Where are you?
- In a delicatessen.
Terrific.
Now will you please get right back here?
Yes, sweetheart.
As soon as I finish my sandwich.
Bye.
May I have a pickle, please?
- Hello, sweetheart.
Are you all right?
- Just fine.
Fine.
I called Larry and told him we wouldn't be there.
- How'd he take it?
- With his usual good grace.
He said if you couldn't come to the cocktail party, you'd better be having the baby.
Well, I hope you told him that Well, that's not exactly what he said, but to calm him down, I sort of Well, I implied that maybe we were going to the hospital.
Darrin Stephens, you're worse than Larry.
Samantha, you've finally seen the light.
- Will you bring Bombay back?
- I heard.
I heard.
That silly old goose reversed the spell.
Darrin.
- Maybe you weren't lying.
- About what?
- About going to the hospital.
- Samantha.
You mean, this is really This is the time?
I'll get your bag!
- Mother, will you call Dr Anton?
- Yes.
His number's on that book on the television set.
- Yes.
- And get in touch with Dr Bombay.
- Yes.
- Don't you worry, sweetheart.
I'll get you to the hospital.
You just relax.
I forgot the keys to the car.
Darrin!
- What?
- You forgot me.
Right.
Right!
- Darrin, you don't have to go so fast.
- Lf you don't mind, I'm not a cabdriver, and I'm not very good at delivering babies, so hold tight.
- I told you, you shouldn't go so fast.
- I know.
Don't worry.
Every cop understands about pregnant women.
I'm getting hungry again.
Well, get your mind off of it.
Think about something else.
Think about baseball.
Right.
Baseball.
Baseball.
Pitchers, catchers, scorecards.
Can you help me?
I need an escort.
Scorecards, home runs, hot dogs - Can I see your licence, please?
- Certainly.
I know I was exceeding the speed limit, but, you see, my wife is going to have a baby.
- That so?
- Yes, and I've got to get her to the hospital.
Well, where is she, in the glove compartment?
Oh, no.
Sam?
- Sam?
- Your wife's name is Sam.
- Yes.
- And Sam's having a baby.
- That's right.
- Okay, Lucille.
This is really gonna cost you.
Admitting, please.
No relish this time, just lots of mustard.
Hello.
Is there a Mr Darrin Stephens there?
May I speak with him, please?
Thank you.
Hello?
Sam, where are you?
I'm at Shea Stadium.
- What?
- I'm at Shea Stadium.
The Dodgers are playing the Mets.
Sweetheart, you never should've started me thinking about baseball.
Sam, what's going on?
Well, the bases are loaded, there are two outs, and Willie Davis is up.
Sam, I mean, are you okay?
- I'm fine, just fine.
- Good.
Now will you get over here as fast as you can?
I don't care what the score is.
Will you hurry?
As soon as I finish my hot dog.
Hold on!
Sam?
Sam.
Hello?
Hello.
Sam?
Darrin, you know why it's so quiet here?
No.
Why?
Willie Davis just hit a grand-slam home run.
Oh, boy.
Sam, will you please hurry?
Okay.
Bye-bye.
- Hello, Doctor.
- Hello, Darrin.
- Where's Samantha?
- She'll be here any second.
- You mean, she didn't come with you?
- Well, yes, she did.
But, you see, she stopped off to get a hot dog.
Here she is.
I don't believe it.
I've never known an expectant mother who was so preoccupied with food.
Nurse, would you arrange to have Mrs Stephens taken up to her room?
And I'll see you up there in a few minutes, Samantha.
And, please, no more food.
Samantha, I don't know if I'm going to survive this.
Well, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
But as soon as Dr Bombay gets here, it'll all be solved.
Very good.
Yes?
I'm sorry, Darrin.
You'll have to wait outside.
I just wanted to tell Samantha that the person that we were expecting to arrive hasn't.
Well, don't you worry, sweetheart.
He'll be here.
Just be patient.
You know, this is getting to be quite a bore.
Do you know what you put us through by reversing that spell?
Well, you can't win them all, dear boy.
However, I think I can straighten her out.
- This her room?
- No, you can't go in there looking like that.
You've got to look more professional.
For your information, clothes do not make the doctor.
However, if it will make you happy - Interesting.
- What is it?
Well, it's nothing to be alarmed at, but it's just that - Yes?
- Hello, Samantha.
How are you?
Bombay's the name.
Medicine's my game.
Dr Bombay is a friend of the family.
I don't understand.
Nothing to concern yourself about, my dear chap.
My practise doesn't compete with yours.
I'm here as a consultant.
- So if you'll kindly step aside.
- I beg your pardon.
Dr Bombay, I think perhaps you ought to wait outside.
- Lf you don't mind.
- Very well, if you're going to get huffy.
These mortal doctors certainly are thin-skinned.
Wouldn't let me anywhere near her.
Oh, well, I'll go back when he leaves.
That might be too late.
I don't want my baby born in a hot-dog stand.
I don't see how that would hurt.
At least you'd know your child would be able to cut the mustard.
There you go.
I'll just have to get him out of there.
Please, don't be upset.
Dr Bombay just misunderstood.
I only wanted him to visit socially.
Well, I understand.
Anyway, as I was saying, it's nothing to be alarmed about.
It's just that Well, I've got some rather interesting news about your baby.
What baby?
This time, in addition to the medication, I think I will add a little whammy.
Onus maximus rebus quills, cure this patient of her ills.
Food won't come and food won't go.
She'll be fine Dr Anton, you're looking a little pale.
Are you all right?
No.
I'm getting a checkup first thing tomorrow.
What are you doing here?
I'm sorry.
We just had to see her once more before she had the baby.
Well, there's plenty of time for that.
Well, according to my examination, Samantha isn't due for a while.
- For a while?
- How long a while?
Well, it's nothing unusual.
It's just a little false alarm.
Well.
I'll just wait at the desk until Sam comes down.
I'm sorry we put you to all this trouble, Doctor.
Don't apologise.
It happens.
And forgive me if I offended you, Doctor.
I didn't realise you were a friend of the family.
Actually, I'm only a friend of half the family.
I see.
Well, goodbye.
Goodbye, Dr Bombay.
Don't think I don't appreciate what you did.
Because I don't.
Someday you're going to make a beautiful artichoke.
Darrin!
Have I got great news for you.
When I told Paxton the baby was being born today, do you know what he did?
- No.
What?
- He told me that in honour of the baby being born on the day we were honouring him, - he was awarding us his account!
- But, Larry, you see You didn't even tell me whether it was a boy or a girl.
Not that it matters to Paxton.
Sam, they're not letting you go home already.
- Didn't Darrin tell you?
- It's not that I haven't tried.
- Tell me what?
- It was a false alarm.
You look more disappointed than I feel.
Paxton was gonna give us his account in honour of the new baby.
Well, what makes you think he won't feel the same way when it is born?
He'll be sober by then.
Unless Sam, how would you feel about spending the night here?
And tomorrow morning, I'll bring Paxton around to see you and the new baby.
What new baby?
Well, you mean to tell me in a place like this we can't borrow a Listen, that's a $2 million account!
Larry, I hope you're kidding.
Of course I'm kidding.
Come on, sweetheart.
Maybe we could borrow a camera and take a picture of a baby in a nursery, and then Larry, you son of a gun.
Thank you.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
We're all set.
The car's in the driveway with the motor open and the door running.
That's good.
- How do you feel?
- I feel fine.
Yeah?
The important thing is not to panic.
You're not the first woman to have a baby, and you won't be the last.
Yes, sweetheart, and it's not even my first baby.
Dr Anton.
We forgot to call Dr Anton.
No, no, no.
I called him before I woke you up.
- He's meeting us at the hospital.
- Good.
Tabitha.
Who's gonna stay with Tabitha?
Esmeralda.
I yoo-hooed for her.
She's up in the guest room, prepared for duty.
Well, in that case, we took care of everything.
Yes, we did.
- Darrin.
- Sweetheart, will you get in the car?
- We're wasting time.
- Just one quick question.
- What?
- Shouldn't I drive?
- In your condition?
- I was thinking about your condition.
Don't be silly, I'll drive.
- Maternity?
- How did you guess?
We're Mr and Mrs Darrin Stephens.
My wife is a patient of Dr Anton.
Yes, Mr Stephens, Doctor called us.
If you'll just fill out this admissions form for us, I'll set the red tape in motion.
- Samantha, my dearest.
- Daddy.
Well, the hallowed moment has arrived.
I thought we agreed not to let anyone know until after the baby was born.
I would have you know, you earthbound clod, that I am not just anyone.
I was attending an interplanetary banquet in my honour, when across the cosmos I felt the vibrations of incipient maternity.
Swell.
They're coming down for you now, Mrs Stephens.
- Thank you.
- Nurse.
I am Mrs Stephens' father, here to share her magnificent experience.
Fine, you can sit in the waiting room with Mr Stephens.
Couldn't he wait down here?
Why?
He's her husband.
I know, but I hate crowds.
Mrs Stephens.
Madam, your chariot awaits.
I'll see you later, sweetheart.
Now, try not to think of this as a problem.
Think of it as a chance for you and Daddy to get better acquainted.
I don't wanna think of that either.
Maurice, is there any chance I could persuade you to go back to your banquet, and let my wife and I have this magnificent experience to ourselves?
Forget it.
- This is painfully monotonous.
- Then why don't you leave?
Mr Stephens?
Yes.
Dr Anton wanted me to give you a happy message.
- Is it a witch or a warlock?
- I beg your pardon?
- A boy or a girl?
- A boy.
A handsome, healthy, seven-pound boy.
- We'll show him to you soon.
- How's my wife?
She's just fine.
You can see her soon, too.
A boy.
It's a boy.
Congratulations.
Congratulations.
Any news about my wife, Mrs Ralph Davis?
Not yet, but soon.
You know, that's not fair.
I was here first.
My dear sir, this is a hospital, not a delicatessen.
Cigars for everyone.
How did he do that?
Well, he's a professional magician.
The hand is quicker than the eye.
You know?
Mrs Horgan!
When a father gives you a cigar, you're supposed to save it for your husband.
Rock-a-bye, baby On the treetop Mr Stephens.
Why don't we leave the cigars and you behind?
- Where did it go?
- You swallowed it.
He's terrific.
A son.
I have a son.
What's more important, I have a grandson.
Are they all so small?
Would you like yours to be elongated?
Maurice, you've seen the baby, why don't you just run along?
- I wish to see his mother.
- Sorry, the father only.
The recovery room is down the hall to the right.
Okay.
See you later, pal.
You can see him in a few minutes through the glass in the nursery.
Thanks.
- Yes, sir?
- Why did you put him in the second row?
Because the first row is taken.
Then do some rearranging.
That child is my grandson.
I want him front and centre.
I'm sorry, we place all our children first come, first serve.
But they all get equal attention.
I want the Stephens child to have special attention.
- Why?
- Because he's a very special baby.
Isn't that apparent?
Grandpa, all babies are special.
Excuse me.
"Grandpa, all babies are special".
Well, Grandpa will change that.
Precious package full of grace, incandescent and so new, whatever mortal sees your face will fall straightway in love with you.
- Greetings.
- Greetings.
- Have you seen the Stephens boy?
- Well, I'm not sure.
- Now, which one is he?
- Need you ask?
Front and centre.
Why, that's the most beautiful baby I've ever seen in my life.
You're merely being tactful.
No, no, I mean it.
Helen, have you seen the Stephens boy?
Sure, I helped deliver him.
But I didn't notice how gorgeous he was.
Well, ladies, don't you have enough work?
Mrs Horgan, just look at the Stephens boy.
That's funny, I just That's the most magnificent baby I've seen in 20 years of nursing.
That's better.
A task well done.
Mrs Horgan?
I just saw a man disappear into thin air.
So what?
Look at the Stephens boy.
He's gorgeous.
Come in.
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, Dad.
How are you feeling?
Lighter.
Yeah, you look wonderful.
So do you.
Do you remember seeing me last night?
Vaguely.
Did I say anything you could use against me?
Yeah.
You said, "Darrin, I love you".
Just think, a boy.
Yeah, a boy.
Did you see him this morning?
- I saw him last night.
- Did you call your folks?
Yeah, Mother said she'd be by this evening.
How about your mother?
She'll be by this afternoon.
I was hoping you could delay telling her for a while.
Say for about four years.
Sweetheart, Daddy knew, so I had to tell her.
Speaking of Daddy, did the two of you have a nice time last night?
Sure.
He's a million laughs.
Come in.
Mrs Stephens, I'm Mrs Goodall, day supervisor, and I just want to tell you I think your son is fantastic.
You do?
Thank you.
- I'm mad about him.
- So are we.
By the way, a Mr Tate is here to see you.
Thank you.
See?
We have a very special baby.
That's because he has a very special father.
And a very, very special mother.
Well, I'll go show Larry the future President.
Son of a gun.
- Which one is he?
- Front row, centre.
Excuse me, fellows, I'd like to see the Stephens baby.
So would we, wait your turn.
- Who are they?
- I don't know.
Look at the shape of his head.
Perfect.
Which one is yours?
Over there, Paikowski girl.
Which one is yours?
Second row, Johnson boy.
These are other fathers, and they're raving about your baby.
Yeah.
And I know why.
That's the most magnificent baby I've ever seen.
- Well, he is kind of cute.
- Kind of cute?
He's superb.
He's so superb I'd like to adopt him.
Larry, don't be ridiculous.
Darrin, that baby of yours does something to me.
I've got to have him.
But you already have a son.
I'll trade you.
Larry, are you all right?
Well, I guess I always was a sucker for a baby.
Take me to Samantha.
I wanna pay tribute to her.
Samantha.
Sam, there are times when the mere word "congratulations" is totally inadequate.
- They're lovely.
- Not half so lovely as you.
- Well, thank you.
- And not one-tenth so lovely as your son.
- You like him?
- He loves him.
And so does everyone who sees him.
So let's get down to business.
Does Sam know we need a campaign for Berkley?
- No, she doesn't.
- Why not?
Because I haven't told her.
Sam, we represent Berkley Baby Foods.
The product needs an image, and you just gave birth to him.
We're gonna put your son's picture on every label.
On newspaper and magazine ads, on national billboards, and on primetime network television.
Well, I'm very flattered, Larry, but Larry, let's get something straight.
Our baby is not doing any commercials.
Darrin, I have an instinct.
Your son is going to be the most famous child since Shirley Temple.
Larry, I'm very flattered, but - And the wealthiest.
- I'll try again.
Larry, I'm very flattered, but - But what?
- I agree with Darrin.
I don't want our son to do commercials.
Kids, don't make a snap decision.
Talk it over while I round up a movie crew to make a test commercial.
Bye-bye.
Sam, don't you think Larry is kind of overreacting?
I think the whole hospital is overreacting.
The head obstetrician was in here just a few minutes ago.
He wanted to know if we would permit the hospital to commission a mural of our son for the lobby.
- What?
- As an inspiration to others.
Sam, has your mother done something sneaky?
No.
Mother promised she'd hang up her sneakers until we got the baby home from the hospital.
Then it's got to be your father.
Good day, children.
What, as they say, is new?
You tell us.
Maurice, everyone in this hospital is flipping over our baby.
Well, what's wrong with that?
They want to paint a mural of him in the lobby.
- Smashing notion.
- I think it's a terrible notion.
Why?
Aren't you proud of your own child?
Daddy, for heaven's sakes, of course we are.
I mean, it's natural that we would think he's the greatest thing that ever happened, but it isn't natural for strangers to think so.
It is now.
Then you admit it.
You tossed around some of your voodoo.
Let us say I gave the natural an assist from the supernatural.
You cast a spell to make whoever sees our baby fall in love with him.
Indeed, I did.
Well, we demand that you uncast it immediately.
Samantha, one more word out of him and I'm leaving.
Darrin, this is no time to upset Daddy.
Say you're sorry.
- Sorry.
- That's the word.
Daddy.
Oh, Daddy, come back here.
Darrin, you shouldn't have upset him.
- Sure.
- Daddy.
Daddy, I want you to come back right this minute.
You dialled the wrong number.
My dear Samantha, congratulations.
You too, Durwood.
Darling, how do you feel?
Physically fine.
Emotionally upset.
- Daddy was here, and he - Maurice?
You invited Maurice before you invited me?
Well, we didn't exactly invite him.
He just kind of barged in for fun and games.
And do you know what he did?
He cast a spell so that every mortal who looks at our baby will fall madly in love with him.
That explains what I've just witnessed.
- You saw the fan club?
- I thought for a moment mortal taste was improving.
Mother, could you find Daddy and bring him back?
Now you need Mother, do you?
After you've had my grandson behind my back.
Could we discuss this after you find Daddy?
Very well.
I'll try.
Okay, fellas, right this way.
Just a second, who authorised this?
Why, nobody.
It's a screen test starring the Stephens baby.
The Stephens baby.
In that case, regulations suspended.
Thank you.
Come on, fellas.
Samantha, your father is a very stubborn man.
He refuses to undo his deed.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to take another peek at my grandson.
Well, we'll go with you.
I want to see what's going on out there.
Honey, are you allowed to get up?
Dr Anton said if I felt like it, I can, and I feel like it.
Excuse me, fellas.
I'm trying to line up a shot.
Bob, why haven't you come to see me?
I've been looking at the baby.
Then I forgive you.
He's really great.
What do you mean he?
Our baby's a girl.
How dare you look at someone else's baby?
Honey, just look at him.
I see what you mean.
Darrin, this is terrible.
- I know.
- I think it's delightful.
All right, fellas, here's your mark.
Sam, Darrin, nice to see you, Endora.
- What's he doing?
- He's shooting a commercial.
Of my grandchild?
Samantha, are you going to permit your son to be exploited by mortals?
- Well, I don't want to, Mother, but - Okay, fellas, roll it.
You know, there's a point.
Daddy is making our son famous.
- Do you know what's going to happen?
- What?
Come here.
Well, when the Witches' Council finds out, the Witches' Council who wants my marriage to get as little publicity as possible, they are going to be so angry at Daddy that they are going to call the Warlock Shakespearean Society and have him expelled.
Samantha, this is blackmail.
Yes, I know.
You gonna pay it?
"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
"It cannot be, But I am pigeon-livered and lack gall "To make oppression bitter".
Very well put.
Are you gonna pay the blackmail?
Yes.
The magic from my spell be flown, from this moment, to each his own.
Yeah, that's a pretty good-looking kid.
But look at our little angel.
She's really beautiful.
Cut.
Cut.
Darrin, why did you bring a movie crew to the hospital?
- Mr Berkley.
- Daddy!
How's my daughter and my granddaughter?
- We're both fine.
- Mr Berkley, I guess you're wondering why we have all this movie equipment at the hospital.
No, I wasn't wondering, but I guess you wanna tell me something.
Well, it's just that Stephens had this idea.
- And, well, I doubt that - Mr Berkley.
I'm Mrs Stephens.
Darrin and I just had a baby, too.
- Well, congratulations.
- Thank you.
Sweetheart, why don't you tell him your idea?
Well, I Mr Berkley, when Darrin saw your granddaughter, he got the idea that she would be the perfect image for Berkley Baby Food.
- Really?
- That's right.
And I approved the idea.
And with no thought to the expense, we hired a movie crew to test her.
Tate, Stephens, you're on the ball.
Especially Tate.
I'll take a look at the test and give you my objective opinion of how beautiful she is.
Fine, Mr Berkley.
All right, fellas, over here.
We'll take another close-up of Mr Berkley's granddaughter.
Maurice, do you remember the night Samantha was born?
Shall I ever forget?
It was a traumatic experience for me.
For you?
I like that.
It was the eve of the Metaphysical Meditatum and Barbecue.
No, it was not, Maurice.
It was the eve of the Galactic Rejuvenation and Dinner Dance.
I flew to your bedside from Jupiter.
No, you flew to my bedside from Venus.
- Jupiter.
- Venus.
Look at them.
Mr and Mrs Average Grandparent.
Mommy!
Hi, sweetheart.
- Mommy, I missed you.
- I missed you, too.
Sweetheart, here's your new baby brother.
- How do you like him?
- He's very nice.
How long is he going to stay here?
Forever.
We discussed that, remember?
Even if he doesn't become a warlock?
Even if he doesn't become a warlock.
- But I bet he will.
- I bet he won't.
Very funny, Endora.
I didn't do it.
Samantha?
No, neither did I. Mother, can a warlock start that young?
Well, I've never heard of it.
But of course, his heredity is exceptional.
On your side, of course.
I did it.
It's my being-born present.
Isn't that sweet?
Yes.
And no.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Sam, what are you doing?
My folks specifically asked you didn't go to any trouble.
After all, you've only been home from the hospital a week.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm feeling fine, and I'm just making a few little appetizers.
- I have to serve them something.
- Well, you know how they are.
They don't want to feel like they're imposing.
Unlike some members of your family, who shall go nameless.
Samantha, my darling.
How are you?
Just fine, Mother.
It's a pleasure to see you, Endora.
And it's a shame you can't stay.
And how is my adorable new grandson?
Thriving.
And Darrin is talking to you.
Who?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't see you, Durwood.
- Thanks.
And the name is Darrin.
- That's your problem.
Now, stop it!
Both of you.
It's all right, my dear.
I only came to see my grandson and warn you about something.
But if that's his attitude Warn us about what?
Your father.
He's coming to see his new grandson.
- When?
- Today.
What?
And now that I've delivered my message, I think I'll toddle along.
I don't want to be around when Maurice finds out.
- Finds out what?
- That you didn't name the baby after him.
But we did.
Frank Maurice Stephens.
Oh, Samantha, you have a delicious sense of humour.
Do you think for one second your father will take second billing to anyone?
Mother.
Dear.
You're the only one who can handle Daddy.
- Won't you please stay?
- Are you kidding?
My folks are gonna be here in less than an hour.
- They are?
- Sam.
Oh, sweetheart.
Now don't worry.
Once Daddy arrives, no one will dare pay attention to anything else.
- You sure know how to relax a guy.
- Well There's my little beauty.
Samantha, he looks exactly like you.
But he has Darrin's eyes.
Ah, yes, but that'll change, if we're lucky.
That's my folks.
Endora, wouldn't you just love to go upstairs and watch Tabitha while she's napping?
No.
I wouldn't miss seeing your mother for the world.
That's what I was afraid of.
- Hi, Mom.
Dad.
- Hello, darling.
- How are you?
Good to see you.
- How are you, dear?
Samantha, how are you, dear?
- Sam, you look fabulous.
- Why, thank you.
Oh, yes.
You'd never think to look at you that You remember my mother?
- Of course.
How are you?
- How nice to see you again.
Oh, it's a pleasure to see you, too.
Samantha, do you think it's wise to have so many visitors when you've just come home from the hospital?
Well, actually, Samantha's mother just dropped in unexpectedly.
- Here, for the baby.
- Oh, thank you.
Come on.
Come on in.
Oh, you brought the baby down here!
- You're the cutest-looking thing I ever saw.
- Oh, hello, precious.
What a darling.
You know he's the exact replica of you, Darrin?
He sure is.
This is adorable.
Thank you.
Just a little token.
Actually, I'm putting a nice block of stock in little Frank's name.
Who?
Oh, Frank, the baby.
Well, that's very generous of you, but you really shouldn't.
Why not?
After all, nothing is too good for my namesake.
Would you think it too inquisitive of me if I asked what you brought for the baby?
Yes.
But I'll show it to you anyway.
A flower?
Isn't that sweet.
Did you grow it yourself, or did you just throw caution to the winds and buy it?
For your information, this is no ordinary flower.
Naturally.
The gift of beauty I give to thee.
Sweet as this flower shall you be.
Beauty is yours in mind and sight from baby's breath to the end of night.
Mother, that was lovely.
Thank you.
I don't understand.
Well, it's an old custom in our family.
Sort of symbolic.
My mother's gift is the hope that the baby will grow up to love beautiful things.
Well, isn't that curious?
- Sounds like a storm is coming up.
- You can say that again.
Mom, Dad, come out on the patio.
Have I got something to show you!
What is it?
This.
I planted this the day the baby was born.
Well, it's very nice, but Why all the urgency?
Samantha, my darling, how are you?
Daddy.
Daddy!
I just want to warn you, Darrin's parents are here.
Well, why are you warning me?
You should be warning them.
Oh, you, too, Endora.
My cup runneth over.
Excuse me.
Darrin!
Hey, guess who's here?
You've met my father.
You remember Mr and Mrs Stephens.
- How do you do?
- Well, hello.
Hello.
- How nice to see you again.
- How are you?
And you.
Samantha, you look just as radiant As radiant as a daughter of mine should look.
Congratulations to you, and Dustbin.
You mean Darrin.
If you insist.
There he is.
Look at that tiny, flickering smile.
Oh, Daddy.
Babies don't smile when they're less than two weeks old.
They do if he says so.
Aren't you going to ask me what I brought as a gift?
No.
I mean, it isn't polite to ask.
Oh, do tell us what it is.
Here we are.
Hear these words, O newborn child, on whom the universe has smiled.
With this flower, I do shed the gift of laughter on thy head.
Thank you, Daddy.
If it doesn't fit, you can exchange it.
Well, that was very nice, however, it seems that you and Endora are hoping that little Frank grows up to be a florist.
The acoustics must be faulty in here.
For a moment, I thought I heard you call the baby "Frank".
The baby's name is Frank, after my father.
But his middle name is Maurice.
His middle name, eh?
That is very flattering.
In fact, I'm positively thrilled.
Daddy, please.
We can't afford any more of your enthusiasm.
Excuse us.
What was that all about?
About $150, the way I figure it.
Oh, actually, it was just some kind of an earth tremor.
Daddy, it's nothing personal.
It's just a mortal custom.
The first boy is usually named after the husband or the husband's father.
Foolish custom, my dear.
It's like a bad egg.
It's better to break it than keep it.
Oh, that's very good, Daddy.
I think this calls for an open discussion, without the presence of your in-laws.
But they just got here.
As far as I'm concerned, they've overstayed their welcome already.
Oh, Daddy, please.
Be reasonable.
This is their first visit since we brought the baby home, and, really, how can I get them to leave?
I'm glad you asked that.
Frank.
Frank, I think it's time for us to go.
- Are you getting one of your headaches?
- I'm getting something.
Darrin, tell Samantha we're leaving.
Oh, there you are.
We have to go, Samantha.
We have to.
- Oh, what a shame.
- Well, it's been very nice seeing all of you.
- And I hope sometime we can - Please, Frank, let's not dawdle.
We'll see you to the car.
Endora, I don't think you'll find this very entertaining, so if you'd care to leave Why, Maurice, are you telling me to get out?
Certainly not, my dear.
I was merely suggesting if you have something better to do, perhaps you'd better.
And if I choose not to?
Endora, how would you like a little trip to Mars?
Oh, it's so dead up there this time of year.
- Yes, but you'll liven it up.
- Well, if you put it that way, I'm off.
Where's Mother?
She's just remembered something she'd rather not do.
Well, now we've got rid of everybody, we can discuss this calmly, rationally.
Just a minute.
I'm beginning to get the picture.
Did you do something to my mother to make her act that way?
Why your mother acts the way she does is strictly between her and her Maker.
You know what I mean.
You put a spell on her to get her to leave.
- I did?
- Didn't you?
I did.
I don't get it.
We waited all week to see the baby, and we weren't there 15 minutes and you wanted to leave.
What got into you?
Frank, just be quiet and keep driving.
- There's nothing more to be said.
- Oh, yeah, well, I'll Apparently, that isn't going to stop you from saying it.
Daddy.
Darrin is absolutely right.
It wasn't fair for you to do that to his mother.
Oh, stop this eternal bickering.
Where are we going?
Where do you think?
Home.
But this is ridiculous.
I waited all week to see the baby and all we did was say hello.
Frank, what's gotten into you?
To tell you the truth, I had almost hoped for twins, so I wouldn't have to face this problem.
Twins, eh?
Well, that could be arranged.
No, thanks.
Now look, it's as simple as this.
A baby can't have two first names, so we had to make a choice.
My dear chap, you're not labouring under the misapprehension that I want the baby named after me?
- You don't?
- Nothing could be further from my mind.
- I don't get it.
- You will.
It's just that Frank is a dubious name at best, and quite unsuitable for a warlock.
Well, maybe we'll be lucky this time, and the baby will turn out to be 100% mortal.
For the sake of my daughter's happiness, I'll pretend I didn't hear that.
If you will excuse me, I think I will take the baby out of the line of fire.
See you later, Maurice.
- There, doesn't that sound better?
- The baby's name is Frank.
Darrin, will you please calm down?
- Samantha, stay out of this.
- Sweetheart, you're being very foolish.
I don't care what he does to me.
It's my son, and I'll decide what his name is going to be.
And furthermore, not meaning any disrespect, Maurice, but it's none of your business!
Daddy, will you please control yourself?
You know why you and Darrin clash, don't you?
Because you're both so much alike.
You're both men who refuse to compromise.
How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child.
You dare to compare your father with this papier-mâché mortal?
This This reflection of a man?
I'll put him where he belongs.
You What did you do with him?
Sam?
Get me out of here!
Oh, my stars!
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
I'll have you out of there in five seconds.
Daddy, I am going to count to three, and by that time, I want Darrin out of there.
One, two, three.
Four?
Be patient, Darrin.
- Now I know where I get my stubborn streak.
- I am not stubborn.
- How about obstinate?
- Well, that's better.
Thank you.
Oh, Daddy, it just isn't fair.
Now I want you to get him out of there immediately.
Only if he agrees to change the baby's name.
I refuse!
Suit yourself.
Boy, are you a bum sport.
Sam, it's freezing in here.
- Why is it cold?
- Just luck.
I'll get rid of whoever it is.
Don't move, sweetheart.
Hello, Samantha.
We're back.
Phyllis wants to apologise for leaving so abruptly.
Please, Frank.
I can do my own apologising.
Well, aren't you going to let us in?
Of course.
I didn't realise that that was why you Is your wife gone?
Gone, but the memory lingers on.
Where's Darrin?
Well, something came up unexpectedly, and he had to leave.
- What's that?
- Do you like it?
Yeah, well, Darrin had it done just recently.
It's something new.
Yes.
It projects your image into a mirror.
Why, that's sensational.
I never saw anything so lifelike.
You know, it's the strangest thing.
The eyes seem to be following you.
Yeah, well, that's part of the effect.
One of my father's inventions.
Why, that's terrific.
I didn't know you were interested in photography.
I'm a jack of all trades.
- Frank.
- Yes?
I just saw him move.
Oh, Phyllis, take a pill.
I think you and I should have a little talk.
Do you know I had just the same idea?
I'm always on the lookout for a good investment.
Let me ask you some questions.
Now, when did you take out the patent for this process?
Oh, many, many years ago.
I tell you, this is just what I've been looking for.
Tell me something, Frank By the way, is that short for Franklin?
No, no.
Just plain Frank.
Yeah.
An appellation you have to share with the lowly hot dog.
Still, it's a good, simple, unadorned name.
Yeah, well, it suits me.
Down to the ground.
Of course, there is one drawback about having a namesake.
What is that?
Well, in order to distinguish between the two, people inevitably refer to one as "big" and the other as "little".
You know, that's true.
I was named after my grandfather, and I've been "Little Frank" to my family ever since.
And you don't find that amusing?
It's a pain in the neck, if you want to know the truth.
You don't say?
What does your father do for a living?
Well, he's sort of retired, like Mr Stephens.
I hope he enjoys it more.
Look at that.
What?
Darrin's picture.
What about it?
Frank?
- Yes?
- I want to go home.
Excuse me.
- What is it now?
- I finally got that headache I was expecting.
Daddy, I want you to get Darrin out of there this minute, or I'll I I don't know what.
All you have to do is to ask.
- See?
- Thanks, for nothing.
You're welcome, for nothing.
Daddy, wait a minute.
What suddenly made you decide to give in?
I had a nice little talk with your father-in-law, and he volunteered he'd rather not have the baby named after him.
Sure.
You had a nice little talk and put him under a nice little spell.
On my word of honour, I swear I did nothing of the sort.
- Your word of what?
- Darrin.
Why doesn't he want the baby named after him?
Because he doesn't want the baby called "Little Frank" all his life.
Yeah, that always did bug Dad.
Well, it seems we're a united family once more, so to speak.
Well, before I take off, I'll just go up and kiss little Maurice goodbye.
Daddy, wait a minute.
I hope you won't take offence, but Do you really think "Maurice" is such a hot name?
"Hot"?
Perhaps not.
But resounding, yes.
Maurice!
- How does "Maury" strike you?
- Maury?
Yes.
That's what all the kids will be calling him.
Before you know it, we'll all be calling him Maury.
Nobody ever dared call me Maury.
Actually, as long as we don't have to name the baby Frank, there is a name I'm very fond of Adam.
That was my great-grandfather's name.
Adam was your great-grandfather?
Not that Adam.
Adam, huh?
Adam.
Adam Stephens.
No.
No, I don't like it.
- Why not?
- I don't know.
I just don't like it.
Fine.
You've expressed your opinion and now you can keep out of it, or I'll put you back in that mirror, permanently.
Well, I guess I'm outvoted.
First sensible thing you've said today, Dolphin.
Now, I'll just pop up and say good night to little Adam.
That was very clever of you, sweetheart.
I knew if I said I liked the name, he'd hate it, just to be disagreeable.
You see, you worry too much.
Everything turned out just fine, didn't it?
Oh, sure.
My mother's home with a nervous breakdown, I almost freeze to death in a mirror, and my father thinks he's going to make a million dollars with a non-existent invention.
But for your family everything turned out fine.
Sweetheart, the important thing is everything turned out all right for our family.
Well, when you put it that way, who can argue?
- Here you go.
- Thanks.
What a day.
I tell you, I'm exhausted.
Yes, I know.
Daddy can be pretty tiring.
Cheers.
I suppose it could have been worse.
I don't know how.
Mommy, the baby's up.
Oh, maybe I better change him.
Don't change him.
I like him the way he is.
- You don't think that's funny?
- Hilarious.
Why don't we send it in to the "Adorable Sayings of Children" in the Witch's Digest?
- Oh, hi, Sam.
Hi, Darrin.
- Hi, Dad.
How's Mom?
Oh, she's fine.
I gave her an ice bag for her head, and she's happy.
Well, if it isn't my big little girl.
Hello, sweetie!
- How do you like your new baby brother?
- Fine.
We're not gonna change him.
She means we're going to keep him.
Isn't that cute?
Hilarious.
Tabitha, why don't you run upstairs and keep the baby company?
- I'll be up in a minute.
- Yes.
Good idea.
See you later.
I just talked to this fella that I know.
He is the head of the number one photo outfit of the country.
And I was telling him about this new process that Sam's father has invented.
- Yeah, well, I - You know, he wouldn't believe me.
So I want to borrow the picture and bring it over to - What happened to it?
- Well, that's what I was trying to tell you.
Tell him, Sam.
Well, actually, that's one of the problems with my father's invention.
- It fades.
- Yeah, fades.
He never mentioned that to me.
Oh, he's very sensitive about that.
Yeah, sensitive.
Well, this is very embarrassing.
What am I going to say to this fella?
He's the head of the number one photo outfit of the country.
Well, why don't you just tell him you decided to deal with number two because they try harder.
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
No.
I'll think of something.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Mommy, it's beautiful.
I'll be the most beautiful princess on the whole block.
Well, I certainly hope so.
Every other child on the block's a boy.
Am I going to have a crown?
Yes, as soon as Daddy's shirts come back from the laundry.
Daddy's shirts?
Yes.
I need the cardboard out of them to make your crown.
Then I'm gonna get some sparkle paint, and I'll put lots of jewels and things on it.
- Oh, my goodness!
- Did I scare you?
Yeah.
A witch that looked like that would scare anybody.
Would I get more treats if I go trick-or-treating as an ugly old witch?
Probably.
But you and I know that witches don't look like that.
They're just the same as everybody else.
Almost.
I don't know why we just don't tell everyone we're witches.
Then they'll find out what wonderful, nice people we are.
Well, I'm afraid that's out of the question.
People don't really think there are such things as witches.
So we'll just have to keep our little secret, okay?
Okay.
Mommy, can I wear this crown instead of the cardboard one?
Mother.
What makes you think I did that?
It could've been something she ate.
Just send it back where it came from.
I don't see why a granddaughter of mine should have to wear a crown made of shirt cardboard and sparkle paint.
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
You're gonna have a beautiful crown.
Samantha?
Samantha, what's the meaning of all this?
Mother, you know perfectly well that those are Halloween costumes.
Perfectly harmless and unrealistic.
And discriminatory against a minority group.
You of all people.
Tabitha, why don't you run upstairs and play?
I think maybe Grandmamma would like to have a little talk.
Samantha, will you please explain the meaning of these dunce caps?
And these hideous masks?
Well, Mother, it's all for a good cause.
I'm helping out on the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF Committee, and I was just making some of the costumes for the neighbourhood kids.
That's a tawdry excuse.
I know very well who's behind this.
It's Durwood.
He's brainwashed you.
- Easy, Mother.
Darrin will hear you.
- I heard her.
I heard her.
There's more, there's more.
I absolutely refuse to let my daughter participate in this barbaric mortal holiday that has maligned our image for centuries.
Mother, may I remind you that I am perfectly free to do whatever I wish.
Just as long as whatever you wish is whatever he wishes you to do.
- That is not true.
- Mother, it's really very simple.
I agreed to live in this mortal world.
And as long as Halloween is part of that world I know, I know, I know.
You took your vows for better and for worse.
- And you certainly are getting the worst.
- Now, just a minute, Endora.
Darrin, you must realise that Mother tends to get a little upset - this time of the year.
- Upset?
Upset?
I'm not upset, I'm incensed.
To think that you, Samantha, would participate in depicting your own kind as toothless old hags with scraggly eyebrows and stringy hair and an evil cackle.
Now, don't forget the wart on the end of a long, crooked nose that she keeps sticking into everybody else's business.
Samantha, I will not stand here and be insulted by something that's 90% water.
- Oh, now - Oh, yeah?
Well, how about something that's 100% hot air?
Will you please tell what's-his-name he's finally pushed me too far?
- She says you finally pushed - Samantha, will you please tell Madame Defarge that you happen to be my wife, and that Tabitha happens to be my daughter, and if we choose to celebrate Halloween tomorrow night and every other night of the week, it's our business and she has nothing to say about it.
You noticed she had nothing to say.
Toothless old hags, are we?
With warts and scraggly eyebrows and stringy hair.
- Good morning, Darrin.
- Good morning.
Bartenbach's on his way up.
So let's give him the glad hand and the big smile.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
Nothing.
Darrin, there's no reason for you to be glum.
I've gone over this presentation from cover to cover, and I want to tell you it's beautiful.
Thank you very much, Larry.
Glad you liked it.
I'm sure Bartenbach likes it as much as I do.
Good, good.
- Darrin, are you all right?
- No.
Trouble at home?
No, no.
It's just I have this toothache.
- Yes?
- Mr Bartenbach is here.
Send him in, send him in.
I'm sorry about the tooth, but you know how important this account is, so it's mind over matter.
Okay, old boy?
Now, let's give him a big smile.
Mr Bartenbach, come in, come in.
- Morning, Tate.
Stephens.
- Good morning, good morning.
Good to see you again, Mr Bartenbach.
I don't know what you two have to smile about.
It can't have anything to do with this presentation.
It's a bummer.
That's exactly the word that I was passing along to Stephens here when you came in, Mr Bartenbach.
- A bummer.
- But, Larry, you said Don't argue, Stephens, Mr Bartenbach knows what he wants.
- I certainly do.
- Suppose you tell us what that is?
Well, I don't pay McMann & Tate to pick my brain.
Of course not.
I just thought we might expedite.
Okay, Stephens, let's give Mr Bartenbach the alternate presentation.
Right.
I'll go home and start work on those right now.
Just tell Mr Bartenbach what you have.
Well, somebody around here better start working on them, or I'm taking my business elsewhere.
I'm sure that won't be necessary, Mr Bartenbach.
McMann & Tate will come through for you.
You just leave it to us.
Betty, I'm going to work at home the rest of the day.
Yes, sir.
I think I need a coffee break.
You didn't think I'd forget the wart and the long crooked nose she sticks in everybody's business?
Hello, Officer, I guess this isn't my lucky day.
I don't suppose you get lucky very often.
I think I know what you're going to ask.
I'm not going to ask you for a chorus of Tiptoe Through the Tulips.
- Cute.
- Now, I got nothing against you guys wearing your hair long, but you could at least comb your eyebrows.
I don't blame you for what you're probably thinking, but I don't think anything any more, buddy.
I just stand around here and hand these out.
Anyway, you guys got something going for you.
You don't have to dress up for Halloween.
Sign here.
Whatever turns you on, fella.
Well, Samantha.
I see you're still determined to perform this treacherous folly.
Mother, don't overdramatise.
Durwood has to learn a lesson, and he's fortunate to have me to teach it to him.
What have you done?
Your mother always does unto others what they do unto her.
Why don't you get back to your little Halloween celebration, and I'll get back to mine.
Mother.
Don't you go too far.
Sam!
Boy, did you go too far.
Your mother has gone too far.
Funny, I was just saying that.
Where is she?
I'd like to speak to her.
Why, Durwood, I didn't know you cared.
Endora, I want you to know that this time I am fully aware I am responsible for your irascible behaviour.
And, Endora, I do owe you an apology.
For years, mortals have projected witches in this image.
I should have known better.
Well, I I must say I don't know what to say.
You don't have to say anything.
Just do it.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
On the other hand, it was wholly within my province to remind you that you have no business sticking your nose into the affairs of my family.
It's a matter of integrity.
He had a point to make.
Well, he didn't have to make it with my nose.
Mother, no.
I fully expected that.
Now, if you'll both excuse me, I have some important work to do.
Samantha, you're married to the most stubborn, the most obstinate Mother, now, please be reasonable.
After all, Darrin did apologise.
That's an apology?
Well, all right.
If you get Darrin back to normal, I will not go trick-or-treating with Tabitha.
- Is that a promise?
- Promise.
And you won't give in to any undue influence that Durwood might exert upon you?
Mother, Darrin isn't the one that exerts undue influence around here.
Very well, Samantha.
I want you to know you've made your mother very happy.
Well, now you make me very happy.
You just get Darrin back to normal.
My dear, for Durwood that is normal.
Mother, get with it.
Well, I like you much better with a haircut.
Where's Endora?
I think the least I can do is congratulate her for admitting when she's wrong.
Well, she left.
You know Mother.
She couldn't stand your getting sentimental over her.
- Hey, look.
Cute, huh?
- Heaven.
Sorry.
- Good morning, Mr Stephens.
- Good morning, Betty.
- Mr Tate in yet?
- He certainly is.
He's in your office.
Good morning, Larry.
I suppose you're anxious about the Bartenbach presentations.
- Right.
- Well, all our worries are over.
I worked the rest of yesterday afternoon and most of last night on a new campaign.
- Marvellous.
- Bartenbach is going to love it.
I doubt it.
For your information, Bartenbach's wife is the local chairwoman of the Trick-or-Treat for UNICEF Committee.
She is?
Well, that's great.
Samantha happens to be doing a lot of work for that committee.
Sam was doing a great deal of work for that committee.
She just quit.
Bartenbach called me to tell me about it.
- And he didn't sound pleased.
- Well, now, wait a minute, Larry.
I have to admit, Darrin, I'm surprised.
To think that Sam would turn her back on a great cause like this.
All those hungry little kids.
Well, I'm sure Samantha had a good reason.
And I think I know what it is.
Never mind a reason, what about our client?
We stand to lose one of the biggest accounts we've ever had.
Now, just a minute, Larry.
All right.
I'm sure Sam has a good reason for what she did.
I would suggest you find out what it is and do something about it.
How was I supposed to know that Mr Bartenbach's wife was the head of the committee?
Sam, you know it doesn't matter to me about Bartenbach.
I'm not worried about losing a client.
I'm only concerned that you understand you cannot fight my battles for me.
- But - Especially my battles with your mother.
- It doesn't matter what Endora does to me.
- It does to me.
And I think, in the case of Halloween, Mother's point of view should be respected.
You, Tabitha and I are going trick-or-treating.
Millions of hungry children are more important than one stubborn witch.
Oh, boy.
- Now, Mother - Never mind, Samantha.
Dobbin is absolutely right.
Millions of hungry children are more important.
And I am a stubborn witch.
All right, Samantha, I'm ready to go trick-or-treating.
Come on.
Here we go.
That's it.
Hi, Tabitha, I bet you don't know who I am.
Yes, I do, Tommy, you're Batman.
Tabitha.
Tabitha, did I scare you?
Don't be silly, Bobby.
I know you're not really a ghost.
Come on, Mommy, let's try the next house.
No, sweetheart, I think we ought to wait till your father catches up.
- Tabitha, did you see what I saw?
- What?
What?
There's a real witch down the street.
Now I know what's keeping your father so long.
Trick or treat.
Hello.
Here's something for you and something for you.
One for you, and there's one for you.
And one for you, and who's your big friend?
Better watch out.
He's a real witch.
- Happy Halloween.
- Yes.
Now wait a minute, and I'll get the money for UNICEF, okay?
Now let's fill all the boxes up with the money, huh?
- There's one for you and one for you.
- Give me one.
And one for the big bad witch.
The big bad witch thanks you.
- Come on, kids.
- Bye-bye.
Have fun.
Golly.
I wish we had a real witch to go trick-or-treating with us every Halloween.
That's no witch.
That's my daddy.
Did you make that costume, too, Mrs Stephens?
No.
No, Tabitha's grandmother made this one.
- How are you holding up, sweetheart?
- I've never had it so bad.
But UNICEF has never had it so good.
Well, Mr and Mrs Stephens, your group has collected more than any individual group from this neighbourhood in the history of UNICEF.
Good.
Well, thank you, Mrs Townsend.
It must be the authentic costume.
That did it.
That did it.
Tabitha, come on, let's get some cookies.
Excuse me, Michael.
Here we go.
Mr Stephens, you're the talk of the neighbourhood.
I can't get over how real your costume is.
I mean, it looks like if I pulled your hair, it would really hurt.
- It would, it would.
- Mother stuck it on with glue.
And that outfit's giving me an idea.
Imagine a picture of an ugly old crone of a witch and underneath it the caption, "Don't look like a witch.
Use Bartenbach dental cream, "hair tonic, skin lotion, wart remover".
Harold, I love it.
Well, Stephens, tell me how you love it.
Mr Bartenbach, I'm not sure that you'd want I'm sure, Stephens, and we'll get things under way first thing in the morning at your office.
Well, I don't think I'll be coming in to the office tomorrow.
I've had a rather strenuous evening.
Right.
I'll pick up Tate, and we'll meet at your home.
You do look tired.
Poopsie, I've come up with another great idea.
And we owe it all to Mother.
"Mr Darrin Stephens, trick-or-treating in an authentic witch costume, "proclaimed neighbourhood Father of the Month "as his group collects record amount for UNICEF".
I just wish I could take off my authentic costume between Halloweens.
- Have you been trying to get your mother?
- All morning.
Mother, you have to do something about Darrin.
"I could change him into a pumpkin.
Love, Mummy".
Halloween is over, Mummy.
Can't you forget it?
No.
Mother, you don't realise what you're doing.
I know very well what I'm doing, and I intend to go right on doing it.
Do you realise that you have given the witch's image that we hate more publicity than it's had since the Salem trials?
Samantha, if you think you're going to make me back down that easily - That's probably Larry.
- Darrin, wait a minute.
Haven't you always said that you like to base your campaigns on positive rather than negative concepts?
- Yes.
- Well, then.
How about Glinda, the Good Witch of the North?
Who?
Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.
Of course.
You're the best witch a man ever had.
- Mother?
- Samantha, you win.
- I'm bored with all this trivia.
- Good.
- Hi, Larry, Mr Bartenbach.
- Stephens.
Darrin?
Didn't I just see Robin Hood?
Well, if you did, you haven't been taking your liver pills.
Well, come on in, gentlemen.
I've been thinking about Mr Bartenbach's campaign, and I decided we should get away from the stereotyped witch.
I mean, well, who's to say that witches really look like I did last night?
Who's to say they don't?
Everyone knows witches have hooked noses, warts and blacked out teeth.
Frankly, Mr Bartenbach, you don't know what you're talking about.
- Look, fella, I don't like being insulted.
- Neither do witches.
Well, I mean They've got feelings, too.
This witch thing's got him freaked out.
- You're afraid of offending a witch?
- Now hear me out.
The old-fashioned witch image is okay for kids, but kids don't do the buying.
We should use as an image a beautiful witch like Well, like Glinda.
- Who?
- Who?
Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.
- Good Witch of the North.
- And he doesn't want to offend her.
Gentlemen, may I present the alternate concept, Glinda, the Good Witch of the North.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
- Mr Bartenbach.
- Hi, Mrs Stephens.
Sam kindly offered to demonstrate.
Darrin, who made you an authority on witches?
It's instinct.
Mr Bartenbach, wouldn't you prefer your product to be associated with this image?
Mr Bartenbach's already made up his mind, Darrin.
The caption reads, "To look like Glinda, the Good Witch of the North, "use Bartenbach products".
- Darrin, you've got to be crazy.
- I like it.
Crazy to come up with such a fantastically good idea.
I don't know where you get your instincts, but I hope you never lose them.
Me too.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
You'd think they'd invent a device for doing this.
They have.
It's called a "daddy".
You're sure that none of your relatives are liable to pop in?
Darrin, I told you, they're invited to a masked ball in Tasmania.
It's the event of the year.
They're all going.
You know, you're turning purple.
And it's not your best colour.
- Hiya, Sammy.
- Hi there, Uncle Arthur.
- Hey, weren't you invited to the ball?
- No, the Count's still sore at me, 'cause the last time I was there I nailed one of his shoes to the floor as a joke.
- That's funny?
- It was when I gave him a hot foot.
In fact, it was a scream.
Sure.
Anyway, I'd much rather come to Tabitha's birthday party.
I love parties.
I'm just a kid at heart, you know.
Yes.
You've made that abundantly clear through the years.
Don't start with me, fella, 'cause in a battle of wits, you're unarmed.
Here's one for you, Sammy.
A famous character in history.
Give up?
Napoleon Balloon-apart.
Sam, it took me over an hour to blow up those balloons.
What a waste of hot air.
Uncle Arthur, Tabitha is on the patio.
She's setting up the pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey game.
- Would you like to help her?
- Love to.
- No hard feelings?
- Of course not.
- For a mortal, you have very few faults.
- Well, thanks.
But you certainly make the most of the ones you do have.
Boy, what a couple of stiffs.
Oh, well.
Tabitha?
Your favourite uncle's here.
- Hey, you're doing very well.
- Gee, thanks.
I'm crazy about cutting out paper tails.
He already messed up two of them.
Squealer.
Just for that, I have a good mind not to give you your present.
Please, Uncle Arthur, please.
Where is it?
Right here.
Happy birthday, princess.
- It's empty.
- Of course.
It's a wish box.
Whatever you wish for, you'll find inside.
Uncle Arthur, I remember.
You gave me one of those for my sixth birthday.
Yeah.
You were the only kid on the block with a pin-striped unicorn.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Hi, Larry.
Hi, Darrin.
I'm in a bit of a jam.
A.J. Sylvester just called and he's coming up to look at your layouts for the new campaign.
Larry, I told you a long time ago about Tabitha's birthday party.
Can't you stall him until tomorrow?
I could do some magic.
I could show them some tricks they'd never forget.
That's what I'm afraid of.
All right.
I could do those dumb tricks magicians do, like pulling a rabbit out of a hat.
That's what I'm gonna wish for, a bunny.
A little cottontail bunny.
I wish for a little cottontail bunny.
Well, where'd that come from?
Uncle Arthur gave it to me for my birthday.
Oh, yeah?
Sweetheart, guess what?
Uncle Arthur's gonna put on a show for the kids.
A magic show.
You mean a witchcraft show, don't you?
Who's gonna know the difference?
Me.
So forget it.
If misery were snow, fella, you'd be a blizzard.
Here.
Now look over here.
Everybody turn around.
Okay.
There.
Good.
There we go.
Okay, we're gonna start the magic show now.
Now everybody on this side of the room, - go sit over here.
- Here.
Sit over here.
- Here, let me move this.
- You two get up there.
Okay?
- You want to hold your rabbit?
Come on.
- All right.
Come on, rabbit.
Now, just let it sit.
There.
Now Robert, it isn't polite to punch Annabelle in the stomach.
Where should I punch her?
These kids could scare a tribe of head-hunters.
- Can you get that, sweetheart?
- Sure.
I'll take it in the den.
Good luck.
- Hello.
- Darrin, it's me.
Larry?
Can you speak up?
No, I can't.
I just stepped out of the office to call you.
Sylvester's in there and, buddy, it's murder.
- He's in a terrible frame of mind.
- What's the matter?
Well, apparently, his girlfriend dumped him, and he's miserable.
Then why don't you take him out and buy him a drink?
Well, you're pretty casual about the whole thing, I must say.
Well, what do you want me to do, cut my throat?
Hello?
I'm thinking it over.
Look, Larry, I've got to go.
Goodbye.
Remind me to put Stephens on the "B" list for Christmas.
I will now do my famous ring trick.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
That's not it.
Before your very eyes, I shall join these three rings.
Voilà!
There's nothing tougher than a matinee audience.
What'd I do?
This is ridiculous.
I know, sweetheart, but the kids love him.
All right now, kiddies.
Are you ready for the big one?
- Larry.
Mr Sylvester.
- Darrin.
I've convinced Mr Sylvester that only you can do justice to these layouts.
Could we have a little quiet, please?
Samantha's uncle is entertaining the kids.
Come on in.
All right now, kiddies.
Are you ready for the big one?
Is your uncle a professional?
Well, you might call him a professional amateur.
Now would you believe that behind this cloth is a little cotton-tailed bunny?
- No.
- No.
Yes.
Keep it up, kid.
You'll make a terrific toadstool.
All right now.
If you're ready Close your fingers and cross your eyes.
Get ready for a big surprise.
The rain is dry.
The night is sunny.
Hold and below, a cottontail bunny!
I asked for a cottontail bunny, not a cocktail bunny.
Pretty.
I say, it's a pretty good trick, isn't it?
One of the cutest tricks I ever saw.
Yeah.
Well, if you think that's something, wait till you see him make her disappear.
- Right, Uncle Arthur?
- Right.
Right.
Okay, kids.
Get ready for the big disappearing act.
Close your fingers and cross your eyes.
Get ready for a new surprise.
Bats in the belfry, pigs in a poke, lose this bunny before I choke!
Uncle Arthur, this is no time to kid around.
Who's kidding?
Okay, kids.
The show's over.
Now, everybody into the dining room for ice cream and cake.
Come on.
All right.
Be careful now.
Okay.
Everybody have what they want?
That's good.
Now just enjoy your ice cream and cake.
Yes.
Don't just stand there.
Send her back to the nearest Playboy Club.
What's the matter with you, Sammy?
She's not a Playboy bunny.
It's Tabitha's rabbit.
I don't care what it is.
Just change it back into what it was.
Don't get shook, Sammy, but there's something wrong with my powers.
Terrific.
I'd like to go over these layouts with you.
- Well, sure, but what's wrong with later?
- Yeah, later, Darrin.
I want to talk to that fellow about that girl.
I mean, about that trick.
- But, Mr Sylvester - Later, Darrin.
Cool it.
- I sure would like to know how you did that.
- So would I. Uncle Arthur means that if he told you, then you'd know his secret.
I hope you're not gonna make this pretty young lady disappear.
Well, this is Bunny.
Bunny, Uncle Arthur's assistant.
Mr Tate.
- Hi.
- And Mr Sylvester.
Hi.
My, this certainly is a fun party.
Mr Sylvester, I'd really like to go over these layouts with you because I think in the long run you're May I ask, how long will you be staying?
I don't know.
Sam, don't you think you should take Bunny somewhere so she could change?
Oh.
Yes.
But I have to serve some more ice cream.
- Okay, then why don't I take Bunny - On second thought, Uncle Arthur can serve the ice cream.
Okay, kiddies.
Here comes Uncle Arthur.
Stuff yourselves.
- Well, why does she have to change?
- Yeah, why?
I liked the other outfit better.
Yes, but I think this one is safer.
Besides, as soon as they've left, we're gonna put you back in your own little fur coat.
I don't care.
I'm going to have some fun while it lasts.
Okay.
Just stop doing what comes naturally.
Well, that didn't take long.
Bunny's a quick-change artist, you know.
I'm quick at everything.
May I say what a sensational dress that is.
Do you really like it?
I'm afraid it's a little tight.
Nonsense.
It looks like it was made for you.
It was.
All right.
Who's the wise guy who dropped the ice cream on my shoe?
Sounds like he needs help.
Excuse me.
How come you have such funny little ears?
All right, Uncle Arthur.
I'll take over here.
Where are you going?
I thought I'd talk to Sylvester about the layouts.
- I mean, isn't that why he came over?
- Will you stop with the layouts?
Why don't you go out and see if you can get Bunny to leave?
Why?
Got you.
Sammy, I don't know how you do it.
This party's taken more out of me than a hard game of elephant polo.
All right.
Who's the wise guy who dropped the ice cream on my shoe?
Why are you so uptight?
At least it's taken his mind off his problems with his girlfriend.
- They're gone.
- What?
Excuse me, Larry.
Hi, sweetheart.
- Now don't get excited.
- I'm already excited.
What's wrong?
The lovebirds have flown the coop.
They've gone?
They can't go.
He hasn't approved the layouts yet.
What am I saying?
He's out with a rabbit.
So long, Charlie.
Another double, Charlie.
Looks like we got lucky.
You know, I always have trouble with spells for locating people.
How'd you do that?
Well, I went up to Larry, and I put my right hand on his right shoulder and I said the magic words.
Yeah?
What were they?
I said, "Larry, do you have any idea what Sylvester's favourite hangout is"?
Is that any way to talk to your uncle?
Thanks, Charlie.
Another one of the same, Charlie.
It's hard to believe they only met an hour ago.
You know how fast bunnies work.
Alvin!
Hi, Anita.
Alvin, I haven't seen you around here since Since That's right.
Too many memories.
That must be the girl he's carrying the torch for.
This could be the solution to everything.
You haven't called me lately.
Well, you didn't come to the phone, so what was the point?
Well, anyway, I can see why you haven't.
This is Bunny.
Bunny, Anita.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Well, I've got to go.
But if you do decide to call again, I promise to answer.
So much for that solution.
Why don't we forget this whole mess and crash the party in Tasmania?
Uncle Arthur, you have no sense of moral responsibility.
One more word and I'm gonna split.
- But - That's the word.
Uncle Arthur, you come back here and pull yourself together.
See you, Charlie.
Call me a cab, Charlie.
Well, hello there.
Mrs Stephens.
I'm sorry we left without saying goodbye, but That's perfectly all right.
I understand.
But I'm awfully glad I ran into you, because I want you to come for dinner tonight.
Dinner?
Tonight?
- That's very sweet of you, but, actually - You have to come.
I'm serving a vegetarian dinner in Bunny's honour.
In my honour?
We're going to have carrot ring, and hearts of lettuce salad.
That sounds marvy.
Doesn't it?
And spinach soufflé.
So that's a vegetarian dinner?
- Yes.
How'd you like it?
- Delicious.
This little lady seems to be enjoying it.
Your eyesight must be perfect.
I've never seen anybody so wild about carrots.
Well, they're very good for you, you know.
I've promised Bunny I'll plant a carrot patch in the garden.
- And lettuce, too.
- Garden?
At my place in the Berkshires.
I'm taking Bunny up there with me tomorrow.
Oh, really?
I might as well tell them.
We're engaged.
Engaged?
- Well, when did this happen?
- On the way over here.
Well, isn't that That's very Isn't it?
Congratulations.
I only wish Arthur were present to hear the good news.
He'll hear about it, all right.
Bunny, why don't you help me clear?
You're gonna have to get used to it, you know.
You're so right.
Oh, you old son of a gun.
Mr Sylvester, I've got to say something to you.
And, please understand, I only have your best interests at heart.
You can't marry her.
- Why?
- Well, she's She's not what she seems to be.
Darrin, for Pete's sake.
Now just what are you implying?
What I'm implying is that she's a - She's a - She's a what?
She's a not-right-for-you.
- I think that's for me to decide.
- Right.
Darrin, I don't want to say that you're out of line, but, boy, are you out of line.
What I mean to say is You're right.
I am out of line.
Now, dear, if it's all right with you, I'd like to leave.
- It's definitely all right with me.
- Oh, please.
Now I want to wish both of you all the happiness in the world.
And I hope you like large families.
Sure, but not right away.
- Oh, yes.
Right away.
Right away.
- What?
I'm sure that Bunny would like to have lots of children.
Yes.
Lots and lots.
Lots.
- How many?
- Hundreds.
Mr Sylvester, how about a little brandy?
Yes.
Anything.
Did you Double.
Yes.
Coming right up.
Usual, Larry?
Please.
Let me give you a hand.
So, you're going to take Bunny to your hunting lodge, huh?
Oh, yeah.
You didn't tell me it was a hunting lodge.
Didn't I?
I wouldn't be interested in hunting, you know.
No?
Well, you don't have to.
What kind of animals do you hunt up there?
Just small game, you know.
Fox, beaver, rabbit.
Rabbit?
You shoot rabbits?
Well, we're doing the farmers a favour.
You know, rabbits are pests.
Well, I never Why did you do that?
Because rabbits aren't pests.
They're very nice.
Nicer than people.
Bunny, perhaps you'd like to go upstairs and freshen up.
I certainly would.
What a temper.
I've never seen anybody so angry.
Yeah.
You might even say she was hopping mad.
I completely forgot about dessert.
Anyone for carrot pie?
String bean sundae?
Sam?
- Hi there, sweetheart.
- Hi.
Hey, Kerb service, huh?
I guess that means that Arthur hasn't come back?
Well, I'm expecting him any minute.
- How'd your meeting with Sylvester go?
- Like silk.
- He bought every one of my ideas.
- Well, that's marvellous.
You're lucky he changed his mind about going out of town.
He didn't change it.
His old girlfriend did.
They're back together again, I'm glad to say.
Well, just you remember that if it hadn't been for Bunny and Uncle Arthur, that never could have happened.
I'll be happy to thank him if he ever shows up.
You want some more ice in that, too?
"Ice" to see you again.
Oh, brother.
Uncle Arthur, you better get out of there before you kick the bucket.
Not bad, Sammy.
It'd have been funnier if I'd said it.
You will, Uncle Arthur.
You will.
I think I resent that.
Anyway, I've got good news for you kiddies.
Knew there was something wrong with my powers, so I went to Dr Bombay, and he gave me a recharge right in my Will you spare us the details and just get rid of that rabbit?
Where is our little fuzzy friend?
She's out on the patio.
I can't keep her away from the grass.
Isn't that cute?
On your feet, honey bunny.
I got a little trick I wanna show you.
- I just love tricks.
- Good.
Spirits high, spirits low, spirit away this child of woe.
I ask you now to reverse this hex that's on this girl of such opposite sex.
I said "sex," not "six".
Arthur, the next time you pass by here, why don't you?
Sweetheart, it really isn't his fault.
I mean, you know how fast rabbits multiply.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Oh, Samantha, I'm so glad I found you in.
Good morning, Mother.
How many guesses do I get?
It's for a masquerade party that the duchess is throwing.
Sam, I haven't got much time for breakfast, so skip the eggs and And skip the breakfast, too.
Good morning, Endora.
You simply must come with me.
It'll be your first vacation since the baby arrived.
- Mother, Darrin said good morning.
- Who?
Oh, him.
Hurry, darling, or we'll be late.
I'll forgive your rudeness, Endora.
I know you're just being yourself.
There is an annoying vibration somewhere in this house, and I wish it would go away.
Now, we are all supposed to dress as nursery rhymes.
I'm going as the Knave of Hearts, but I must find a mask.
- What's wrong with the one you're wearing?
- Lf you don't zip your lip - May I remind you that I will.
Mother, you unzip him immediately.
Certainly.
As soon as we decide what costume you are going to wear to the ball.
I refuse even to discuss it until you remove that.
Oh, drat!
And that's final, you old - Darrin!
- What was that?
I am sick and tired of your mother's barging in here unannounced.
Now, the Constitution guarantees each man the right to protect his home against invaders.
So hear this and hear it good.
Your mother is no longer welcome in this house!
Darrin, you can't do that to Mother.
- I can and I will.
- But And that's final!
Mother Now, Mother, you're not gonna lose your temper, are you?
You are going to lose your temper.
Mother, you have to remember that Darrin is a man, a mortal man with a mortal man's pride.
And you've wounded him once too often.
You say he's a man?
- I say he's a mouse.
- That's not true.
We'll see.
What do you mean by that?
I'll give him until midnight to withdraw his ultimatum.
If he does, he's a man.
If he doesn't, he's a mouse.
You You wouldn't dare!
- Permanently.
- You would.
Excuse me.
Hi, cutie.
Didn't hear you come in.
Hello.
Esmeralda sent me.
What can I do for you?
Got some good specials today.
Eye of newt, half price.
Bats' toenails, 20 off.
Well, thanks, but What I'm looking for is an anti-spell, one that will prevent my husband from being changed into a mouse.
Might have just the thing.
Yeah.
It's right over here.
I picked this up from a witch doctor in Tanganyika.
Will it ward off a bad spell?
Come to think of it, didn't do too much for the witch doctor.
I got this from his estate.
We'd better take a look in the big book.
It's right over here.
There.
Now let's see.
Oh, yeah.
Here it is.
"Spell to prevent subject from being turned into mouse".
You're kidding.
Well, they don't put out a book this size for nothing.
Now, I remember now.
It's a three-parter.
"To void the spell, the subject tries to touch a buffalo between the eyes.
"Next, while underwater he must drink a potion given thee".
- While underwater?
- While underwater.
"To the last of the three, listen and hark.
"He must fly over water by day in the - "In the dark"?
- In the dark.
Well, I might be able to swing the buffalo, but how do you get someone to drink a potion underwater, or fly by day in the dark?
I don't know.
But every time you do it right, you'll hear a bell.
- It's impossible.
- Well, it ain't easy.
Especially since it's got to be done without the subject's knowledge.
Out of the question.
You're not allowed to use witchcraft neither.
- Might as well forget it.
- Yeah, well, might be best.
Ain't the worst thing being married to a mouse.
Okay, wrap it up.
Only one word for these layouts of yours, sensational.
You really like them?
No, I'm just saying that to get on your good side.
Thanks, Larry.
Darrin, I'm going to institute absolute security on this material.
Frazer and Kolten are not only going to give us stiff competition for the Illinois Meatpackers account, but I happen to know that they'll do anything to get a look at our campaign proposals.
- Do you really think they'd try to steal them?
- I'm not taking any chances.
Well, Larry, before you close that could I get a look at the ideas the other guys came up with?
I hope you won't misunderstand, but when I say security, I mean complete security.
That's why I divided the assignment between the three of you.
Isn't that a little silly?
I mean, I have a key to that cabinet, too.
I know.
Let me have it.
I'm surprised you didn't hire a security guard.
He'll be here this afternoon.
Yes?
I'll tell him.
Sam's here with Tabitha.
Shall I have them come in?
What?
You'd let two security risks like that come within striking distance of the master plan?
Okay, okay.
I guess I did go a little overboard.
Keep your key.
No, Larry, I want you to have it.
- I don't want it.
- Larry, here.
Keep it.
And that's an order.
"To void the spell, the subject tries to touch a buffalo between the eyes".
I have a buffalo in my animal book.
Yes, I know you do, sweetheart.
And if we can get Daddy to take us to the zoo, you're gonna meet one in person.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, there.
- Can you, Daddy?
- Can I what?
Well, we were gonna have lunch at the zoo, and we were hoping you could join us.
No chance.
I got work to catch up on.
- Well, you have to eat anyway.
- I'm having a sandwich sent in.
I have an idea.
Why not eat the sandwich on the way, and it'll save time?
Samantha, you're not making much sense.
Well, it's just that Tabitha's looking forward to it.
Aren't you, sweetheart?
- Well, you can go without me, can't you?
- No.
It wouldn't be the same.
Darrin, can I borrow your key to the washroom?
Betty isn't at her desk.
I'm sorry.
That's okay.
Ralph, this is my wife, Samantha, and my daughter, Tabitha.
- Ralph Jackman.
- How do you do?
Say, am I glad to meet you finally.
I've been trying to get Darrin here to let me propose him for membership in our lodge.
Yes, I think I remember him mentioning that.
We're a service organisation, and we do some very charitable work.
And we're pretty choosy about who we let in to the Loyal and Exalted Order of Buffalos.
Well, it certainly sounds like a worthwhile organisation.
Yes, Ralph.
I promise you I'll think about it very, very seriously.
I don't want to leave you with the wrong impression.
We really have a ball.
Bowling, picnics, parties - Yeah, that sounds like a lot of fun.
- It is.
Excuse me, but you seem to have a little smudge right there.
No, no.
You didn't quite.
May I?
Do you have some water?
That's all right.
I'm on my way to the washroom anyway.
Now, just get that little spot right there.
- Mommy, the doorbell rang.
- Doorbell?
Well, you never know.
Maybe Larry installed it as a security alarm.
Could be.
Nice meeting you.
I'll drop these off on the way back.
- You think about the Buffalos.
- I will, Ralph.
Sam, I've gotta get back to work.
You have a good time at the zoo.
The zoo?
Well, I think we'll wait till you can go.
Darrin, you know, you don't look too well.
I feel fine.
Well, there is something going around, and you seem awfully pale.
There's nothing wrong with me.
That's what Ed Bigelow told his wife, and he ended up in the hospital.
- Sam, he broke his leg.
- Exactly.
And I think you ought to come home, just to be on the safe side.
Darrin I didn't know you were still here, Sam.
Hi, Tabitha.
Hi, Uncle Larry.
Did the boy genius tell you about his latest triumph?
Larry, I'm glad you're here.
I think he's coming down with something.
- Sam - He does look kind of flushed.
She said I looked pale.
Pale one minute, flushed the next.
That's not good.
Darrin, we've gotta have you in good shape for our pitch in Chicago.
- You'd better take the rest of the day off.
- I tell you, I feel okay.
I just don't understand why men think it's a sign of weakness to be sick.
- I'm not sick!
- Goodbye, Darrin, and that's an order.
- What about the McKinley layouts?
- Take them to bed with you.
- Keep me posted, Sam.
- Sure, Larry.
Come on, Tabitha.
We're gonna take Daddy home.
"Next, while underwater he must drink the potion given thee".
Now I have to get him into the bathtub.
Now, let's see.
Brother.
Just stick this in here.
All I have to do is put the potion in there and get him to stick his head under the water.
This is ridiculous.
It has to be done.
- How do you feel?
- Like a kidnap victim.
Sweetheart, about Mother not coming to the house.
I'm not going to try and change your mind, but have you changed your mind?
I have not.
- Then you better take a bath.
- What?
A nice, hot bath is just the thing for what you've got.
Sam, I haven't got anything.
And if I did, why risk making it worse by taking a bath?
And what have you got behind your back?
Medicine.
But I suppose you're going to argue about taking that, too.
Now, if it'll make you happy, I'll be glad to take it.
- You will?
- Yes.
- But you won't take a bath?
- No.
All right, sweetheart.
Have it your way.
Okay.
Open up.
- What's that for?
- What do you think?
It's a chaser.
- There it is again.
- What's that?
That bell.
The one we heard in the office.
Oh, sweetheart, your fever must be up again.
You're hearing things.
I asked for a plainclothes guard because some of my employees have been needling me about my security measures.
I understand.
The papers we're trying to protect are in this cabinet.
They may not look like much to you, but they represent a potential fortune to us.
Now, there are only two keys to this cabinet.
Mine and Mr Stephens', who went home sick a few hours ago and They're gone.
Who did you say had the other key?
"To the last of the three, listen and hark.
"He must fly over water by day in the dark".
If I get through this one, it'll really be a miracle.
Oh, Darrin.
- What happened to your hand?
- Just a little burn.
Nothing serious.
But now I do have a problem.
I can't drive, and I have to pick Serena up at the airport.
You're putting me on.
Since when do your relatives use planes?
Serena's on a new kick.
Doing things the mortal way.
Do you mind driving me?
Sam, I'm working.
Can't she take a cab?
Well, you know she doesn't know anything about cabs.
She knows about planes but not about cabs?
Darrin, you're trying to be logical, and where Serena is concerned, that doesn't make sense.
What?
Are you going to drive me or not?
I have to be there in 20 minutes.
It's an hour's drive to the airport.
- I know how I can get there in time.
- You're not using witchcraft to fly there.
No, of course not.
But isn't there a helicopter service from this town to the airport?
- Yes, but - Darrin, that's a marvellous idea.
Now, you get out the car.
I'll tell Esmeralda we're leaving.
Sam, is there something you're not telling me?
Whatever gave you that idea?
I'm telling you.
It's not possible that Stephens could be responsible.
I've known him for years.
We've been friends, the best of friends.
Besides, he stands to receive a substantial bonus if we grab this account.
Well, maybe they offered him a bigger one.
I wish you hadn't said that.
Mr Stephens isn't home, but I spoke to someone, the maid I think, and she said he's on his way to the airport.
The airport?
- Samantha, may I ask you something?
- Sure.
How come you can't drive with that hand, but you can knit with it?
Darrin, you're nitpicking.
- What are you knitting anyway?
- A ski hat.
That looks like one I've got.
Well, I know it looks like it, but it's a different shape.
- What?
- Here, let me try it on for size.
- Sam, what are you doing?
- Just sit still.
- But I can't see a thing.
- I know.
Let's just hope it works.
I heard that bell again, and music.
- Music?
- Yes, where'd it come from?
- I have an idea.
- What?
How about a sweater to go with your hat?
I checked with the passenger agent.
She wasn't on that plane.
Well, I guess it's just another one of Serena's practical jokes.
Oh, yeah?
Well, she owes us for two round-trip helicopter fares.
Darrin, don't be petty.
Let's go home.
- Oh, look.
There's your friend, the Buffalo.
- Who?
Ralph.
Darrin.
Mrs Stephens.
I'm taking a quick trip to visit my sister in Chicago.
Say, next week, why don't you come to a meeting of the Buffalos?
Well, we Did I mention that we have a ladies auxiliary?
That sounds fascinating.
Well, when I get back, we'll sit down, and I'll give you all the details.
- Jet passenger service to Chicago - That's me.
now boarding at gate - Got to rush.
Bye, now.
- Have a good trip.
- Thank you.
Funny, he didn't mention anything this morning about going to Chicago.
Well, let's go.
- Larry!
- Sam.
- What are you doing here?
- Darrin, I have some bad news.
All of our proposals for the Illinois Meatpackers account have been stolen.
- I don't believe it.
- That's terrible.
So naturally, we're going through the formalities of By the way, this gentleman is a security guard.
Unfortunately, I hired him after the barn was stolen.
The horse, rather.
Locked.
Larry, are you implying that Darrin had anything to do with it?
Who?
Darrin?
No.
No.
It's just as I say, a formality.
And the fact that Darrin had the only other key to the cabinet is certainly no reason to Do you mind?
Excuse me.
Is that a formality, too?
Of course, Sam.
We both know that Darrin would never You're under arrest.
- Larry, I swear.
I - How did those get in your case?
Well, I don't know.
I Wait a minute.
That's not even my case.
- It isn't, huh?
- That's Ralph Jackman's case.
- We just ran into him.
- He said he was on his way to Chicago.
No wonder he didn't mention it at the office.
Come to think of it, he borrowed my keys this morning.
My advice is to say nothing more till you see a lawyer.
Ralph Jackman.
Is that the name you mentioned?
- Yes.
- His name's all over this stuff.
- Beautiful.
- Larry, does that mean that Darrin is paroled in my custody?
And next time before you put an innocent man under arrest, I'd think twice about it.
- Put it there.
- Gee, thanks.
And I'm adding an extra 10% to your bonus if we land the Illinois Meatpackers account.
That's wonderful, sweetheart.
And I hope you get the account.
And I hope the Meatpackers win every game they play this season.
Sweetheart, it's almost midnight.
Yes, the witching hour.
- Okay, where do you want me?
- In the kitchen.
I'll get rid of her as soon as I can.
You know, I still can't believe it.
I know your mother doesn't care about me, but how about you and the kids?
She was just upset and angry.
And I don't want her to get angrier.
So we'll just let her think she's turned you into a mouse.
You're sure that antidote of yours will work?
Positive.
Well, if it doesn't, remember to get rid of the mousetraps.
Darrin!
I came right here from the airport.
Come in, Ralph.
Did you I suppose you know we switched cases?
- Yes, I do.
- And I suppose - I mean, you opened mine?
- I'm afraid so.
Well, no one can say you're not prompt.
I have no time for small talk, Samantha.
I have to get back to the party before the unmasking.
Where's Dum-Dum?
He's in the kitchen.
But I got him to agree that you can come and visit whenever he's not home.
How magnanimous of the dear boy.
You don't think so?
You don't.
At this hour the day doth die, spirits howl and spirits cry.
There is a mortal within this house.
When I wave my hand, make him a mouse.
- Where are you going?
- I just want to make sure it worked.
Well, you've never failed before, so I don't see why you should A nice little white mouse.
What?
Oh, my stars!
Mother, you are not leaving this house until you turn him back.
Samantha, don't make a scene.
I'll change him back when he's learnt his lesson in a week or two.
Whenever the party's over.
I must fly.
Mother Sweetheart.
Now, don't worry.
Two weeks will pass quickly.
And fortunately, you're fond of cheese.
I also like nuts.
- Mice eat nuts?
- How do I know?
You rat!
But who Ralph Jackman.
He came by to try to square things.
He certainly does have rotten timing.
That sure is a funny-looking Buffalo.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Darrin, what kind of eggs would you like?
- How about chicken eggs?
- Fried or scrambled?
- Surprise me.
Love you.
What's the matter, love?
Missed your mommy, huh?
"I am a prisoner in an egg foo yung factory".
Okay.
Who's the smart aleck witch?
You owe me one egg.
I hardly think that's a proper way to address your father.
Daddy, I'm sorry.
I thought maybe it was Mother or Serena.
I hardly expected you to make such a quiet entrance.
I didn't want to disturb How is the little prince?
Just fine.
Looking more like you every day.
Just for that, my darling daughter, I'm going to bestow on you the highest honour at my disposal.
Thank you, Daddy.
Hello there, little Adam.
My, he is just thriving, isn't he?
Incidentally, before I left London, I entered him for membership in the Warlock Club.
- At the age of ten weeks?
- Well, it's never too early.
Before you know it, he'll be a man.
And a man never knows when he's going to want to spend the night in town.
If he isn't a member of the club, he'll have to stay in a hotel.
We can't have that, can we?
No, I guess not.
And how is little Tabitha?
- As radiant as her mother, I hope.
- She's taking a walk with Esmeralda.
Why don't you stay for breakfast?
You can see her later.
Love to.
I'll have champagne and caviar.
Beluga caviar of course, caught off the north shore of the Caspian in the month of May.
- And the champagne - I'm sorry.
But we're fresh out of champagne and caviar from anywhere.
Nonsense.
You can't be fresh out of anything as long as you have your powers.
Daddy, stop it.
You know that witchcraft is off limits around here, except in extreme emergencies.
But this is an emergency.
I'm dying for some caviar and champagne.
Well, you haven't lived until you've tasted a handmade breakfast.
You know, the trouble around here is ego, plain, unvarnished mortal ego.
Your husband doesn't want you to use your natural powers because it makes him feel inferior.
But I tell you, unequivocally, that if he had those same powers, his objections would vanish in a flash.
I don't agree.
What a pleasant surprise, company for breakfast.
Yes, Daddy's always a wonderful surprise.
Well, well, well, how good to see you, Dustbin.
Darrin.
It's been far too long since our last meeting.
- I wouldn't say that.
- Darrin, - Daddy's going to join us for breakfast.
- Terrific.
Samantha's looking absolutely fabulous, my boy.
No doubt due to your tender loving care.
You know, your mother's quite wrong about him.
- Sit down.
Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.
- Why so formal?
Call me Maurice.
- Okay.
Maurice.
- Or Dad.
- Okay, Dad.
You were right.
Sir is best.
What's for breakfast?
I think we're having fatted calf.
- I have a little surprise for you, Darryl.
- Darrin.
In honour of the arrival of my first grandson.
- That really wasn't necessary, Maurice.
- Sir.
Sir.
That watch is waterproof, anti-magnetic and has built-in aircraft radar.
Well, it's really very handsome.
- It's shock-proof, too.
- I don't know what to say.
But, best of all, you can perform witchcraft with it.
Now I know what to say.
No, thank you.
- Now look, Darwood.
- Darrin.
What's wrong with using the watch just to tell the time?
You didn't mention it could do that.
- Now, Dustin, my boy - It's Darrin, my boy.
Thank you.
Daddy, if he doesn't want it, why force him?
Why does he have to be such a dog in the manger?
He's no such thing.
He's a man of principle.
You mean he was a man of principle.
Daddy!
That is unfair, unreasonable and downright despicable.
- Yes, isn't it?
- I order you to change You what?
I mean, I beg you to change him back.
Look.
Isn't that sweet?
The doggie's begging, too.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
You looked so cute I got carried away.
Before Samantha comes back down, just between us fellows, why don't you save yourself a lot of trouble and take the watch?
Stubborn.
His highness is tucked in and all is well with the world, except right here.
Daddy, how could you do such a thing to Darrin?
One minute you tell me how well I look thanks to his tender loving care, and then you do something like this.
I know, sweetheart.
I admit I lost my temper a bit, but I was entirely justified.
Of course you were, Daddy, but remember, "The quality of mercy is not strained".
"It is twice bless'd, it blesseth him that gives and him that takes".
"'Tis mightiest in the might" And you are mighty enough to show some of that mercy to Darrin.
Samantha, you should have been a lawyer.
Everything's fine now, sweetheart.
Sure.
Thank you, from the bottom of my jowls.
Now, now, sweetheart, let's be reasonable.
Let's keep an open mind.
It's open.
It's also made up.
Look, young man, my daughter's been decent enough to live your mortal life for five long years.
- Has she not?
- Well, yes.
Well, the least you can do is to experience the other side of the coin for a few short days.
Now, that sounds like a fair compromise.
- A few short days?
- One short day if you like.
- It's a deal, sir.
- Call me Maurice.
Now that he's gone, there are a couple of other things I'd like to call him.
I wouldn't if I were you.
Daddy may be out of sight, but he's seldom out of earshot.
Hello?
Hi, Larry.
I was held up by some unexpected visitors.
Yeah, I'm just leaving.
Right.
Goodbye.
- I've gotta run, honey.
- Well, you haven't had your breakfast.
Yes, you have.
I've got an important meeting this morning and I don't want to be late.
And you know how bad the traffic is at this hour.
What is all this traffic nonsense?
All you have to do is to command the watch and you're at the office.
Actually, Maurice, I love the drive.
Gives me time to relax, listen to the traffic bulletins.
You're trying my patience.
- Darrin, you know Daddy's temper.
- You're doggone right.
Now, just a few simple instructions.
You hold the watch.
You concentrate on where you want to be and you say, Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum.
"Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum"?
That was a dirty trick!
Bye, sweetheart.
See you at dinner.
Well, I'll say this for Darrin.
He disappeared like he's been doing it all his life.
Except for that pained look on his face.
And these.
But he'll improve with practise.
Okay.
Darrin needs a new pair of shoes.
Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum.
Not bad.
The toes are a little pointy, but what does a watch know about shoes?
Darrin, what are you doing here?
- Looking at my shoes.
- Well, they must have wings on them.
I just talked to you at home a minute ago.
Oh, that.
I thought I'd just play a little joke on you.
- Joke?
- Well, actually it's a gadget.
I read about it in Science Over Logic, the new magazine.
You see, I put it on my Dictaphone which is connected to your telephone through the master conduit of the switch box which is connected to the apparatus cabinet of the main wiring terminal.
It bends the voice impulse, you know, it makes it sound like you're there when you're really here.
- No kidding?
- Works great, huh?
And I fooled you, didn't I?
I don't know what you're talking about.
But I would think you would have more important things to do with your time.
For instance, working on the Bliss Pharmaceutical presentation.
- We're due there in an hour.
- It's right here.
Well, let's go into my office and check them out.
By the way, where did those shoes come from?
Rome?
Possibly.
Why, do you like them?
Yeah, they're all right, if you like pointy toes.
He's a fine young lad.
Have you any indication yet of what his powers might be?
- He's only ten weeks old.
- What of it?
At his age, I flew.
How can you remember a thing like that?
When you get caught in a flock of swallows returning to Capistrano, you don't forget.
Yes, he's going to be a fine young warlock.
It is possible that he could be entirely mortal and every inch a Stephens.
Bite your tongue.
I do the feeding, you do the burping.
Now I think I'll just pop in and see how Dustbin is doing.
Oh, my goodness.
Daddy, you're setting the father-in-law business back a hundred years.
Ain't he silly?
He isn't, really.
He's very nice when you get to know him.
Yes, he is.
Yes, he is.
And then when the new Bliss Cough Syrup bottle is on the shelves, we coordinate an advertising campaign on radio and television pegged on the slogan, "Ask any doctor about a bad cough, and he'll tell you silence is bliss".
Clever.
I think.
Clever?
Lt'll knock the competition on its ear.
You're right.
I guess.
Sure, I'm right.
And that new bottle design is a beauty.
- Yes, it's very handsome, very.
- But?
- No buts.
No buts at all.
- Good, then it's settled.
Of course the square bottle with the little gold cap, which was my father's idea, has been our trademark since 1918.
- Really?
- Not to mention that my father has always prided himself on making Bliss Cough Syrup a household name strictly by word of mouth.
Well, Mr Bliss, word of mouth is a good way to spread a cough, not a cough syrup.
That's a good one.
You are joking, aren't you?
- Of course he's joking.
- Well, not really.
The fact is your total sales are down 23% in the past five years.
I know.
Awful, isn't it?
And unnecessary.
You've got to change with the times.
Darrin means that McMann & Tate is prepared to preserve the old while adopting the new.
That sounds like a good idea.
How do you do that?
Yes, Larry, how do you do that?
Let's talk about it over lunch.
I couldn't possibly make lunch.
I'm expected at a board meeting this afternoon.
In fact, I'm late already.
I'm sure the board will be delighted with our unique approach.
Maybe.
But, as you know, we've also been talking to Gilbey Associates about handling our account.
No.
I didn't know.
Of course, what Darrin was just saying about new packaging and using television, that was strictly a personal opinion.
He doesn't have the last word.
- That's up to me.
- Larry.
Well, we'll definitely be deciding on the approach we want at the board meeting today, maybe.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Darrin, I'm sorry.
But I had to do something to show that we were strong yet flexible.
Like a tower of Jell-O.
I'm a man who operates on the theory that you find out what the client wants and that's what you give him.
There's only one fly in that Jell-O.
We're not going to be at that board meeting.
Well, Dolphin, doesn't that suggest something to you?
Maurice, if you don't mind, I'm not the slightest bit interested in attending that meeting, - power or no power.
- You see?
It's obviously important to you or you wouldn't be so overwrought.
Why don't we talk about it over lunch?
I know a charming little Chinese restaurant, very relaxed, only a few seconds from here.
- Well, since I have to eat somewhere.
- Splendid.
Come along.
You can tell the food is excellent.
All the Hong Kong rickshaw drivers eat here.
Never mind that.
You shanghaied me to Hong Kong.
"Shanghaied you to Hong Kong".
That pun is worthy of Uncle Arthur.
Maurice, I demand you get me out of here this instant.
Stop worrying.
You won't miss the board meeting.
I certainly will miss it.
I have no intention of going.
- Why not?
- Because it's dishonest.
You'll be invisible.
Who's going to know?
Me, I'm going to know.
Very well.
You can leave Hong Kong whenever you like on your own power.
I'd swim back before I'd agree to use that watch.
Dolphin, look into my eyes and listen to me very carefully.
You are quicksilver, a fleeting shadow, a distant sound, your life has no boundary beyond which you cannot pass.
You live in music, in a flash of colour.
You live on the wind and in the sparkle of a star.
Go to that board meeting, listen, learn.
And once you've tasted the forbidden fruit, you'll love it.
- You know, sir - Call me Maurice.
You have marvellous powers of persuasion, Maurice.
Yes.
Yes, I know.
- Well, I'd better be getting back.
- Yes, of course.
- Prancee, Zolden - Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum.
- Don't re-write me.
- Zolda, Prancan, Kolum, Pek.
- Kopek, Lum.
- Lum not here today.
- Kopek, Lum.
- Kopek, Lum.
Sometimes I wonder why I even try.
Now then, Father, turning to the Gilbey Associates approach, they have a completely opposite viewpoint from that of McMann & Tate.
Well, go on.
Go on.
Gilbey recommends that we keep the traditional Bliss Cough Syrup bottle.
- With the little gold cap on top?
- With the little gold cap on top.
Good, good.
I like the little gold cap.
Doesn't everybody?
- Yes.
- Yes.
Sorry, I'm late.
I had to pay the cheque and they couldn't change a million yen bill.
What's the matter?
You got a headache?
They'll hear us.
No, they won't.
We're both invisible and inaudible.
Now, at McMann & Tate, Father, they're recommending radio, television, and all that sort of thing.
And what about the Gilbey people?
What's their scheme?
The old mail order approach.
Well, what do you say, son?
Well, sir, I say I'd love to hear what you have to say first.
Smart boy, respects his father.
He'll go far, right?
- Right.
- Right.
Smart old man.
Notice how he controls his child?
- I wonder how he does it.
- Please.
- I told you, they can't hear us.
- No, no, them.
I can't hear them.
I say we've been in business 50 years.
Right?
- Right.
- Right.
If it's good enough for 50 years, it's good enough for 51.
Right?
- Right.
- Right.
- I say we go with Gilbey.
- With Gilbey, sir, all the way.
- Zolda, Prancan - Just think it, lad.
He did that beautifully.
Well, I know when I'm not needed.
Darrin, for Pete's sake, what are you doing in my office?
I didn't even hear you come in.
Well, it's these shoes.
They're not only pointy, they're squeak-proof.
Bliss hasn't called me yet.
What do you think it means?
I think it means we lost the account to Gilbey.
- Who asked you?
- But I know how we can get it back.
Get it back?
We haven't lost it yet.
I just told you Bliss hasn't called.
- Larry, I have inside information.
- You have?
The only way we can get that account is to give old man Bliss what he wants.
What's that?
His little gold cap and a 1930 sales approach.
- Darrin, are you sure?
- I'll stake my job on it.
You have, you have.
Get busy on the new roughs.
I'll call Bliss and try to talk him into another meeting.
Darrin, if you don't mind, this is my office.
Well, I talked to Bliss Jr and hinted that we had scrapped our whiz-bang approach for a more traditional concept, and he went for it.
Larry, you're going to have to get used to something.
I'm never wrong.
I can get used to you never being wrong, but I don't know if I can get used to hearing you say it.
Yeah.
Well, I'd better get these over to the art department.
Darrin, how did you get that inside info?
Larry, if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Son of a gun.
Today Bliss Pharmaceutical, tomorrow the world.
You should have seen him, Samantha, zapping and popping like an old pro.
Remember, he promised only to use the power for one day, after that I'm sure he'll revert to his amateur standing.
I don't think so, Samantha.
He has opened the forbidden can of peas.
He has taken the proverbial inch.
He has tasted power.
It's like pâté de foie gras.
Once you start, you can't stop.
You don't know Darrin.
I know mortals.
They have as much backbone as an earthworm.
Darrin is an exceptional human being.
Your loyalty is commendable, my dear, but your perspective, a little distorted.
That's not true.
He's sensitive, principled and a very good judge of character.
- What is it?
- Here comes the judge.
Goodbye, my dear.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, sweetheart.
Guess what happened today?
Can it wait?
I've got some really good news.
- Mine's pretty good, too.
- Sam, I've got to get this off my chest.
I've come to the conclusion that your father is right.
No, listen.
I married you for what you are.
If I love you enough, I have to accept that.
And I have no right to deny you the things of your natural heritage.
- Well, that's all over now.
- Over?
Yes, your father is right.
You deserve all the things I haven't been able to give you.
- Darrin, I have everything I want.
- Not enough.
Why, by the time I can afford to buy you a mink coat, minks might be extinct.
All I'm suggesting is that we speed things up a little.
Now tell me, what's your good news?
Oh, well, it's about the baby.
He rolled over today.
- Rolled over what?
- You know, turned over by himself.
Hey, that's great.
Let's celebrate.
How about dinner at Maxim's in Paris?
Darrin, would you mind if we spent a quiet evening at home?
Your good news has taken a lot out of me.
I knew you'd be thrilled.
So we'll have a quiet dinner at home.
I'll go get cleaned up.
He has opened the forbidden can of peas.
He has taken the proverbial inch.
He has tasted power.
It's like pâté de foie gras.
Once you start, you can't stop.
Not Darrin.
No.
It's been a big day for him.
A good night's rest and he'll come to his senses.
I hope.
Don't miss part two, "Darrin the Warlock," next week on Bewitched.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I think you're going to find this next activity very amusing, young man.
It's called making Daddy's breakfast.
Now We are going to make French toast.
French toast is Well, it isn't French, and it isn't toast.
And that gives you an idea of what you're gonna be up against in this world.
What's the big idea?
- Daddy.
- Yes.
Daddy.
- Thanks for the mess.
- Anytime.
May I have my egg back?
Thanks.
I pop in to see how your father's enjoying his gift of infinite power, and what do I find?
Daddy, Darrin agreed to accept your gift for only one day.
I'm sure by now he's back to normal.
But you forget how easy it was to persuade him to use my magic gift.
Let me refresh your memory.
Shall we tune in the refrigerator?
Now, just a few simple instructions.
You hold the watch, you concentrate on where you want to be, and you say, Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum.
Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum?
That was a dirty trick!
He was beautiful, Samantha.
You should have seen him, zapping and popping like an old pro, especially when he popped into the client's office to get some inside information.
- That wasn't cricket.
- No, it was eavesdropping.
I don't believe you.
Darrin, how did you get that inside info?
Larry, if I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
You son of a gun.
Today Bliss Pharmaceutical, tomorrow the world.
Now tell me that isn't the look of a man who sees the open door to fame and fortune.
No.
No, that is the look of a man who is trying to satisfy the wishes of his father-in-law for one day.
- I'm sure by now he's back to normal.
- I don't think so, Samantha.
It's like pâté de foie gras.
Once you've tasted it, you can't stop.
As the boys say on Carnaby Street, "He's hooked".
- We'll see.
Darrin's different.
- So you keep saying.
- Good morning, Adam.
Hello, Maurice.
- Good morning, my boy.
- Sweetheart, what's for breakfast?
- French toast.
What do you mean, "Oh"?
I had my taste buds set for something a little more exotic like - Eggs Florentine perhaps?
- Yeah, that might be good.
- And truffles and café au lait?
- Now, that's what I call a proper breakfast.
Sorry, Darrin, but this kitchen is fresh out of truffles.
Now, I know one that's not.
- The Cafe Chez Henri in Paris.
- I don't think I have the time.
I have an appointment at the office.
Darrin, why don't you let me whip you up some French toast, mortal style?
I've got it.
If he won't go to Henri's, he merely uses his powers to bring Henri's to him.
Say the magic words.
Concentrate on Chez Henri.
Of course.
Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum.
Dolphin, you feed your face while I feast my eyes.
You must admit, your father has a gourmet's taste in food.
And a playboy's taste in service.
A kindly word from my devoted daughter.
Come on, let's all have breakfast.
What have we here?
- Samantha?
- No, thanks.
What about these tasty morsels?
I'd put sweaters on them if I were you.
They look a little chilly.
Now then, let's see.
- Maurice, that was a breakfast fit for a king.
- I particularly enjoyed the service.
Thank you, Marie, Yvonne, Gigi.
My compliments to the chef.
That'll be all.
Well, Maurice, I'd better be getting to the office.
If you'll excuse me.
Work, work, work.
The all-consuming possessor of mortals.
Sam, I'm leaving.
- Are the bunnies gone?
- Yes, dear.
Well, have a nice day, and drive carefully.
Remember how bad the traffic is this time of day.
Who worries about traffic?
Zolda, Prancan, Kopek, Lum.
See you at dinner.
You know, I'm beginning to feel a certain affection for Darrin.
Darrin?
That's the first time you've remembered his name.
Well, I feel closer to him now.
I felt safer when you were more distant.
Don't you realise he's just indulging your whim?
Did you hear me suggest that he shouldn't drive to work?
No.
I mean Book, come.
Book, return.
Darrin Don't tell me.
Let me tell you.
You think you saw a book going by.
Yeah, I did think that.
I was just experimenting with my latest diversion.
Mind over matter.
You see, by deep concentration, I channel my thoughts to your cerebellum where I create the illusion of a book moving through space.
Darrin, will you please knock it off with all this hocus-pocus and channel your brain waves to the Bliss Pharmaceutical presentation?
It's almost finished.
Well, here's a little incentive to help you finish it.
$5,000?
Why are you so surprised?
I told you that would be your bonus if we landed the Bliss account.
Well, frankly, Larry, I didn't think you'd really come through with it.
Hey, this check is dated a year from today.
Just a formality.
We don't have the account yet.
Mr Bliss for Mr Tate.
- Junior or Senior?
- Senior.
Put him on.
Hello, Mr Bliss?
Yes.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll pick you up personally at 7:00.
Yes, Stephens will have the material prepared.
I'm delighted, too, Mr Bliss.
See you later.
Your info was right.
Bliss wants to stay with the old-fashioned approach.
And that's what we'll give him when we have dinner with him at your house at 7:30 tonight.
Why my house?
Because that whole new approach was your idea, wasn't it?
Now we've gotta scrap it, and look at all the effort I've wasted.
So the least you can do to make up for it is have the dinner at your house.
Larry, that's not a very good reason.
How about it's gonna be there because I said so?
That's a good reason.
Hey.
I'm gonna have this check redrawn and dated for tomorrow.
You son of a gun.
Take me to Samantha.
Good grief.
Darrin, what are you trying to do, give me whiplash?
Come on, Sam.
That's old stuff for you.
Remember me?
I'm a convert.
Yeah, well, what happened to that wonderful, sweet mortal I said love, honour and no witchcraft to?
He's come to his senses.
All that sacrificing, all that doing without is over.
Where's Maurice?
I'd like to tell him the good news.
He has a skiing date in Zermatt with Jean-Claude Killy, but he'll be back before dinner.
I almost forgot.
Mr Bliss, Sr and Jr are coming here for dinner tonight.
That's the new account we're about to land.
And Larry has given me a $5,000 bonus.
Larry Why would he do that?
I had a little inside info that tied the ribbon on that account.
Inside info?
How did you get that inside info?
I attended a private board meeting compliments of Daddy.
Sam, from now on, you're gonna have everything you deserve and more.
Now listen to me, Darrin.
You may have given up, but I haven't.
I enjoy taking care of my husband and my children in the everyday, mortal way.
I like things the way they are.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
Now, you married me for what I am, and I married you for what you are.
Sam, I've made you live like a mortal for so long you're beginning to act like one.
Okay, Darrin, what would you like me to zap up for dinner?
Anything you want, sweetheart.
Only make it fancy.
Don't you worry, I'll give you the witch's special.
Okay.
Well, I've gotta be getting to the office.
Sam, no more of that, huh?
Hi, Larry.
- Darrin, where have you been?
- No place.
A minute ago I left the office, came right back in, and you were gone.
Now you're back again.
Mind over matter.
I made you think I wasn't here.
Darrin, will you cut it out with this mind over matter bunk?
You're giving me the creeps.
Larry, how do you think I got that inside information on the Bliss account?
You mean by using that mind over matter bunk, stuff, you can tell what our clients are thinking?
Certainly.
You want me to prove it?
Yeah.
Okay.
You go out and ask Betty what she had for breakfast.
Now, she doesn't even have to tell you.
Just ask her to write it down on a piece of paper.
And then what?
Then come back in here, and I'll tell you what she had for breakfast.
Boy, this is crazy.
But if it works, I love it.
- Betty, what'd you have for breakfast?
- Well, I Don't tell me.
Just write it down on that piece of paper.
Mr Tate, are you all right?
Betty, just write down what you had for breakfast.
But why do you care what I had for breakfast?
I don't care what you had for breakfast.
I just want you to write it down on a piece of paper.
Mr Tate, I don't mean to be arbitrary, but isn't this a little peculiar?
Betty, will you stop making a federal case out of this?
I just want you to write down what you had for breakfast.
It's not important at all, and nobody cares one way or another.
So do as I tell you, or you're fired.
Yes, sir.
Orange juice, bacon, eggs straight up, sweet roll and coffee.
Darrin, ours is a great partnership, a wonderful wedding.
With my greed and your talent, nothing can stop us.
- Larry, would you say that again?
- Gladly.
With my greed and your talent, nothing can stop us.
No, before that.
Ours is a great partnership, a wonderful wedding.
Wedding.
Like in marriage.
Yeah.
Darrin, we've got to keep this Darrin, what happened to the sweet, wonderful mortal that I said love, honour and no witchcraft to?
I happen to enjoy taking care of my husband and children in the everyday, mortal way.
I like things the way they are.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
suspicion.
Don't you agree?
- With what?
- Haven't you been listening?
Sure.
But not to you.
- What?
- Nothing.
I tell you, Darrin.
We'll have more wealth and power than even I ever imagined.
We can juggle the stock market, seize control of the national economy.
- Today the nation, tomorrow - Don't say it, Larry.
But you don't realise, Darrin, if we play our cards right, in time, we can rule the world.
Larry, I don't want to rule the world.
Okay, so you don't wanna rule the world.
I do.
I've wanted to rule the world ever since I was a little kid.
And I'm making that check out for $10,000.
See you tonight, partner.
- Hi, Daddy.
- My darling daughter.
Samantha, tell your father what's wrong.
Daddy, I'm worried.
If you're right about Darrin, that means he's changed.
He hasn't changed.
He's matured.
Sam.
- How did you get home?
- I took a cab, thank you.
And I enjoyed every bumper-to-bumper minute of it.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- You're behaving very strangely, Darrin.
- You think so?
Could we have a little private talk?
Just as soon as I have a private talk with him.
But don't go away.
I don't want that much privacy.
Maurice I have a feeling it's going to be "sir" from here on in.
- Could be.
- Well, then, I'll have a martini.
Spanish gin, Italian vermouth and a Greek olive.
You'll have a martini the way I make one for you.
And forget the witch's special for dinner.
Take six chicken pies out of the freezer.
- Is something disturbing you, Dustbin?
- Yes, this.
Take back your hocus-pocus.
Your vocabulary could use a little polishing, but I think I get the idea.
Now, Darrin, don't be ungracious.
Remember, it does tell time, too.
- Forget it.
- As a warlock named Will once said, "Lord, what fools these mortals be"!
Come to think of it, he also wrote, "All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players.
"They have their exits and their entrances, And one man in his time plays many parts".
Daddy, don't you think you're getting a little carried away?
So sorry about that.
I'm leaving the watch here.
Do with it what you will.
As for me, I have a previous engagement for dinner which I propose to make as soon as I leave.
But I'll be back for the fun.
"Good night, good night!
Parting is such sweet sorrow - "That I shall say good night till it" - Say good night, Daddy.
Good night, Daddy.
Oh, what a rogue and peasant knave is he.
Oh, Darrin, I'm so proud of you.
You stood up to Daddy like you had nothing to lose.
As long as I have you, I have nothing to lose.
Marvellous, just marvellous, Mrs Stephens.
The chicken pie and lemon sherbet really hit the spot.
Well, I'm sorry it wasn't a bit more elegant, but I really didn't have the time Nonsense, girl.
I admire your lack of pretension.
- It's an excellent quality.
- Thank you.
- Daddy, I'm so glad you popped in.
- Yes.
- This is my father.
Mr Bliss Sr Mr Bliss Jr. - Bliss.
- And you remember Larry Tate.
- Maurice.
Please, don't let me interrupt.
Please, go on.
Well, Stephens, let's get down to business.
What have you got on your mind?
- There he goes.
- I'll give you odds.
Before we get to the business at hand, why don't we make ourselves comfortable?
That's dirty pool.
Gentlemen, we call this meeting to present an entirely new concept before you decide where to place your account.
Very well.
I assumed that.
And, frankly, we're delighted, in view of McMann & Tate's superior reputation in the business.
Aren't we, Dad?
Go ahead, Darrin.
Mr Bliss, I firmly believe that we should present our original campaign, which we think is more modern and up-to-date.
Right.
Wrong!
What are you talking about?
When I went along with your conservative approach, it was based on my knowledge of what you wanted.
How did you know what I wanted?
- Call it instinct.
- Instinct?
After careful consideration, I'm sorry to say that I find your advertising ideas unimaginative and pedestrian.
- Darrin, what kind of a joke is this?
- Now, now, Tate, let the boy talk.
At least he has the courage of his convictions.
You gotta give him that.
That and two weeks' notice.
- You were saying, Stephens?
- Well, Mr Bliss, getting your account is not our main purpose.
Our objective is to provide you with a campaign that, in our opinion, will increase your sales, which, believe me, your present campaign will not do.
Darrin, about that two weeks' notice, make it 24 hours, starting yesterday.
I don't know why, Tate.
He makes perfect sense to me.
That's why I'm backing him 100%.
I admire Stephens' integrity.
Integrity is our hallmark.
Too bad I can't agree with his advertising concepts.
Darrin, if I've told you once, I've told you 1,000 times, integrity doesn't feed the bulldog.
Well, we've taken up enough of your time.
- Silas, come along.
- Wait a minute, Mr Bliss.
Stephens doesn't have the last word at McMann & Tate, I do.
He isn't even with the company any more.
Mr Bliss, please listen.
Okay, Maurice, your magic watch threw the Bliss account right in my lap.
Okay, I've just thrown it out.
My boy, you've completely shattered my lack of faith in mortal behaviour.
You're supposed to be motivated almost entirely by greed.
Don't you know that?
Daddy, why don't you admit that Darrin's something special?
Some divine power prevents me.
What divine power?
Me.
Modesty is not one of his faults.
I may be ill.
You see, Maurice, a man who has everything doesn't need witchcraft.
You have a lot to learn about human beings.
I beg your pardon.
Daddy, I hope you're gonna take this little setback graciously.
Don't I always?
Now, Daddy - Daddy, are you through?
- I don't think so.
I won't say another word.
Say something.
It would be a lot cheaper.
- That's what he calls gracious?
- For Daddy, that's gracious.
Now I'll take my leave of this mundane establishment and be off to Mount Olympus where the gods and I will laugh to scorn your mortal folly.
Daddy always was one for big exits.
Good morning, Sam.
- Where's Darrin?
- Upstairs, dressing.
Will you tell him I'm here?
- Darrin?
- Yes?
An ex-friend of yours is here.
- Who?
- Larry.
- Tell him I've gone fishing.
- He's gone fishing.
- I just dropped by to congratulate him.
- For what, being fired?
No, for landing the Bliss account.
Larry, it's a little early in the morning.
What are you talking about?
I got a telephone call from Bliss Jr first thing this morning, and he told me that his father had second thoughts.
He said any man who could jeopardise an account as big as Bliss Pharmaceutical, and at the same time lose his job, has to have the best interests of the client at heart.
Well, sweetheart, isn't that wonderful?
Now, wait a minute.
Larry, are you putting me on?
No.
I've got the signed contract right here.
- There's just one thing.
- What's that?
Well, Bliss thought, as a formality, he'd like your signature on the contract.
- Well, how about that?
- Yeah, how about that?
Even though I assured him that you would be assigned to the account.
- Me?
You fired me.
- That's right.
You fired him.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't be ridiculous.
I knew what you were up to.
That's why I threw in the clincher and pretended to fire you.
I think that was the touch that swung the deal.
Larry, you expect me to believe that?
No.
Just sign the contract.
Darrin, you and I are an unbeatable team.
Thank you.
And I'm a big enough man to admit that it was your genius that made this deal.
That son of a gun.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
I've got a feeling in my bones this is the day I'm gonna lower my handicap.
I hope you do, sweetheart.
Gee, Sam.
I know you were up during the night with the baby.
I I feel like a heel running off and leaving you.
Don't be silly.
Saturday is your day.
Live it up.
Just say the word, and I'll stay and give you a hand.
I wouldn't dream of it.
I really wouldn't mind.
Darrin, will you go out there and lower your handicap while the lowering is good?
Talked me into it.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
I hope you get a caddy that snickers.
Mommy, will you read Mother Goose to me?
I can't, sweetheart.
I'm ironing Daddy's shirts.
Please.
I love Mother Goose.
Then why don't you read the pictures?
Okay, Mommy, if you'll read the words.
Please?
Well, all right, sweetheart.
But just for a little while.
Well, all right, sweetheart.
Let's see what we can find here.
Hey, this looks like a good one.
"Hey diddle diddle, the cat and the fiddle, the cow jumped over the moon.
"The little dog laughed to see such sport, and the dish ran away with the spoon".
Mommy, why did the dish run away with the spoon?
Well, I guess it was Or maybe Well, let's see.
The dish ran away with the spoon because.
- Because why?
- Because.
Oh, dear.
Your little brother's awake, and hungry.
He's not hungry, Mommy.
He's just crying for fun.
Want to hear me cry louder than Adam?
No, thank you, sweetheart.
I can.
Yes, I know.
And if you're not careful, you may get a chance to prove it.
I was just kidding, Mommy.
I know what, Tabitha.
While I check on Adam, how would you like Esmeralda to come and read to you?
- I'd like that.
- I thought so.
Yoo-hoo!
Esmeralda?
Yes, Samantha?
- Hi, Esmeralda.
- Hi, Tabitha, sweetheart.
Well, I'm glad you brought your reading glasses.
Now could you just bring the rest of you?
First, tell me who else is at home.
Darrin is playing golf.
Then I guess it's safe.
Esmeralda, do you like Mother Goose?
Does she like me?
I'm sure she would if she met you.
If you'll read to Tabitha, I'll tend to Adam's appetite.
I'd love to, Samantha.
All right.
It's a good book for reading.
- It has lots of pictures.
- Yes, I see.
Hello?
Hi, Mrs Stephens.
How are you?
You are?
You do?
Right away?
Well, as a matter of fact, I am rather busy.
Well, if it's an emergency, perhaps you better come over and tell me about it.
Say, in a couple of hours?
You're at the corner drugstore?
Well, all right, Mrs Stephens.
I'll expect you.
Bye-bye.
Oh, good grief.
Esmeralda, who's Mother Goose?
Mother Goose?
Well, now, let me see.
Mother Goose was Mother Goose was Oh, dear me.
I've done it again.
I've just got to knock off that sneezing.
- Mother Goose!
- Oh, yes.
I'm Mother Goose.
But who are you, child?
You can't be Miss Muffet.
You have no tuffet.
- I'm Tabitha.
- How did I get here?
Well, you see, I'm a witch, but my powers have sort of gone flooey.
So sometimes when I sneeze or hiccup, the involuntary act generates abnormal powers which materialise the thought nearest my cerebellum.
I knew there would be a simple explanation.
Mommy!
Mommy!
What is it, sweetheart?
Look who's here!
Oh, my goose!
It's Mother Stars.
I mean How nice to see you, Mistress Mary.
Are you quite contrary?
I'll say I'm quite contrary.
- You're mad.
- No, I'm just Mad.
I don't blame you.
I'm so embarrassed.
Esmeralda, please don't go.
I'll be right down.
Esmeralda, come back.
She forgot her glasses.
I say, that is a good trick.
- How does she do it?
- Well, she doesn't exactly do it.
It's just something that happens when she gets upset.
- She gets upset a lot.
- Oh, yes.
Well, would you mind telling me where I am?
It's on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't think of it.
You are in the 20th century.
Oh, child, you jest.
No.
No, no, no.
Esmeralda sneezed, and you're here because of witchcraft.
- Well, I - And in a moment, Esmeralda will sneeze you back into your book, I hope.
- Yoo-hoo.
Esmeralda?
- Excuse me, but what book?
Why, your book of nursery rhymes.
- These are my rhymes!
- As you can see.
Oh, how delightful!
And they said Hey Diddle Diddle wouldn't last.
Well, what do they know?
Yoo-hoo!
Esmeralda?
That's probably Mother Hubbard.
I want you to stay out here with Tabitha.
Please?
Well, certainly.
Will you recite me Hey Diddle Diddle?
- Hi, Mrs Stephens.
- Hello, Samantha.
My, don't you look nice.
Oh, thank you, Samantha.
I'm so glad you like my outfit.
I bought it this morning.
Well, good for you.
Well, what's the big emergency?
It's all over, Samantha.
- What is?
- My marriage, dear.
- I have left Frank forever.
- Again?
- What happened?
- What happened?
He's impossible.
That's what happened.
Well, he must have been impossible about something.
If he wants to live in the past, that's his business.
I am a woman of tomorrow, and I intend to dress like one, Samantha.
Oh, I see.
I take it he doesn't like your new outfit.
Well, as a matter of fact, he doesn't.
That can be very irritating.
Luckily I have you and Darrin to stay with.
- Stay with?
- Well, I wouldn't dream of imposing if you didn't have that fabulous Esmeralda.
Oh, yes.
Esmeralda.
She is a treasure, isn't she?
Fabulous.
A treasure, did someone say?
Oh, there you are.
Have you been here long?
Oh, yes.
Yes, right along.
Imagine not seeing a person when that person has been right next to you all along.
Imagine.
Would you excuse us for just a minute?
Of course, dear.
I'll just sit and rest, and try not to think about anything.
I do like your mother-in-law.
Yes, but a mother-in-law and a Mother Goose in the house at the same time are definitely too much mother.
Well, just be patient.
Mother Goose will fade.
My spells always do, you know, sooner or later.
Yes, yes, I know, but it's the "later" that worries me, when Darrin gets home.
Should I make up the guest room?
- What for?
- Your mother-in-law.
One thing we know for sure, she's not going to fade.
That's comforting.
Yes.
I guess you better make up the guest room.
This is especially good sherry.
- Have some more.
- Lf you insist.
You know, Samantha, Esmeralda is really remarkable.
I could've sworn there was no one there, and then, all of a sudden, there she was, out of the blue.
Esmeralda prides herself on being unobtrusive.
I was just wondering Oh, I didn't know you had a guest.
Mrs Stephens, this is my aunt.
Your aunt?
Nonsense, child.
I'm Mother Goose.
And I'm Little Bo-Peep.
But I thought you might be Mother Hubbard.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
This is Mrs Stephens-in-law.
I mean, my mother-in-law.
I was wondering if you might have some curds and whey for Little Miss Muffet and me.
If you'll go out to the kitchen, you'll find some.
- Lovely.
- In the refrigerator.
Icebox.
Marked "cottage cheese".
Cottage cheese.
How odd.
Mother Goose.
How odd.
Mrs Stephens, you'll have to excuse my aunt.
She really does think she's Mother Goose.
Tell me something, Samantha.
Is your whole family wacky?
As wacky as witches, Mrs Stephens.
- Oh, hi, Sam.
- Hi.
Forgive me for barging in like this, but I know Phyllis is here.
What makes you think she's here?
She left this forwarding address for the mailman in a place where I'd be sure to see it.
- Where'd she leave it?
- In my money clip.
That's so you'd remember to drop it off when you went to the post office.
Goodbye.
Phyllis, I don't know why you're so upset.
I honestly don't.
That just shows you how insensitive men are.
- All I said about your new outfit - Frank, I know what you said.
- You said, "Now, that's an outfit".
- Well, it is an outfit.
That is not what you meant when you said, "Now, that's an outfit".
I meant that's not an outfit?
Frank, you know very well what you meant and it wasn't at all nice.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going upstairs and have one of my sick headaches.
Women.
I think they were invented to confuse men.
And who might this gentleman be?
The Farmer in the Dell?
Oh, no.
No, this is my father-in-law.
This is my aunt, but her friends call her Mother Goose.
- I'm glad to meet you, Mother Goose.
- And I to meet you, kind sir.
Well.
You know, there's a great deal to be said for the old-fashioned lady.
What a pretty compliment.
Would you like to come out into the garden with me while I feed Miss Muffet her curds and whey?
I wouldn't miss it.
- Sam, I'm home.
- Just what I needed.
Little Boy Blue to come blow his cool.
Well, that was a quick 18 holes.
Larry forgot to reserve our starting time.
- We didn't even tee off.
- Then you didn't lower your handicap.
No.
I just raised my blood pressure.
Well, you didn't have to leave home to do that.
Sam, what's wrong?
We have a small disaster here, too.
To begin with, your mother's here.
Well, I'd hardly call that a disaster.
I said to begin with.
Your father's here, too.
He's out on the patio.
And what's so terrible about that?
With Mother Goose.
What?
Well, it's nothing to be concerned about.
Tabitha's chaperoning.
I know I'll hate myself for asking, but what's Mother Goose doing here?
Well, I was reading to Tabitha when Adam started to cry, so I yoo-hooed for Esmeralda to come over and read to Tabitha.
Then your mother called and said she was coming over.
And Esmeralda sneezed, and all of a sudden, there was Mother Goose and your mother.
Then your father arrived.
If Mother Goose doesn't fade out right away, she can keep Tabitha entertained.
I bet you've never heard "Jack Sprat could eat no fat" as told by the author.
And how long are you gonna let me talk before you kill me?
Really, sweetheart, you're going to enjoy meeting Mother Goose.
And what does one say when one meets Mother Goose?
Try, "Once upon a time".
She'll love that.
I sometimes wonder what we'd do for kicks if it weren't for the trouble your family gets us into.
My family?
Now, just a minute.
The reason we have a problem is that your mother had a fight with your father and took refuge in our house.
Okay, Samantha.
Okay.
It's my family's fault, and I'll handle it.
- Good.
- With the direct mortal approach.
I'm going out to the patio and tell my father to go upstairs and take my mother home.
Gee, I wish I had thought of that.
Read me another one, please.
Oh, well.
Oh, here's one.
"Jack, be nimble.
Jack, be quick.
Jack, jump over the candlestick".
Hello, everybody.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
- Hi.
- Now, don't tell me.
Let me guess.
Georgie Porgie.
That's who you are.
Georgie Porgie.
He's not Georgie Porgie.
He's my daddy.
And he's interrupting a delightful performance.
- Dad, I have to talk to you.
- It can wait.
How's Mrs Stephens?
She's all settled in nice and cosy, and I think I'm going to fade.
There's no need for you to fade, at least not until you've gotten rid of Mother Goose.
You sure know how to hurt a witch.
Just don't fade.
If it was your fault that your father-in-law was flirting with Mother Goose, and your mother-in-law was practically passed out in the guest room, what would you do?
Well, when you put it that way Well, so much for the direct mortal approach.
My father is so fascinated with Mother Goose, he wouldn't even listen to me.
That may be an idea.
Esmeralda, will you go get Tabitha and take her up to her room?
This may be just the thing to bring your mother to her senses.
Could you think that through a little slower, please?
Well, when she sees your father with Mother Goose, she'll be the same as any other wife, jealous.
My mother jealous of Mother Goose?
Darrin, believe me.
You don't have to be a witch to be wise in the ways of wives.
Or something.
Come on.
Mother, may we come in?
Oh, Darrin, I'm so glad you're home.
A son can be such a comfort to a poor, wretched mother.
- How's your head?
- Don't ask, dear.
Why should I bore you with the details of my throbbing pain?
I think what you need is a little fresh air.
"Uh-oh" what?
Do you think you could choke down a little milk toast?
Samantha, I want to know what you're uh-ohing about.
Oh, nothing.
People do not "uh-oh" about nothing.
Well, it's nothing that would interest you.
Is that funny aunt of yours still here?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, she's out on the patio.
With your estranged husband.
Cute couple, aren't they?
You know, I think I will try just a bit of fresh air after all for my headache.
But all in all, I've written well over 500 rhymes for children.
I'm proud to say that they're still popular.
Oh, yes, yes.
You know, one of my favourites was How does it go now?
"Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub" One thing you can say about Frank, he's polite chatting with that old lady about Rub-a-dub-dub.
Actually, one of the very first I wrote was about Jack Sprat and his wife.
Would you like me to tell you how that came to be?
Well, yes, I would.
But first, let's talk about us.
Now, why did I say that?
You were gonna tell me about Jack Sprat.
Well, you remember how the line went, "His wife could eat no lean"?
Long-winded, isn't she?
Mother Goose, this is fascinating.
And perhaps you'll tell me more when we take a spin in my new carriage.
That would be delightful.
A spin in my new carriage?
I don't have a new carriage.
Your old one will do.
I don't even have an old one.
Why go anyplace?
I enjoy your company right here.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, not at all.
- You know, I've been thinking - I'll bet you have, about the new life waiting for you.
- New life?
- Oh, yes.
- After the divorce, you'll get an exciting job.
- Job?
Probably in electronics.
I don't know anything about electronics.
I'll bet you can hardly wait.
I could wait a little while.
Why wait?
You certainly don't have to worry about how Dad's gonna take it.
He's gonna be very happy with Mother Goose.
What I saw could not possibly have happened.
What did you see?
Mother Goose just changed into a goose.
It must be the sherry.
That's Italian sherry, very strong.
Oh, no.
No, Samantha, let's face facts.
I'm starting to see things.
Mother Goose?
Mother Goose, where have you gone?
Oh, dear.
I wonder if I sneezed another no-no.
Another no-no.
Mother Goose.
Mother Goose.
It's all right.
We only think we're seeing a pair of glasses hanging in midair.
We only thought we saw a pair of glasses hanging in midair.
I only thought I was talking to a goose.
Frank!
Frank.
Daddy Bear is here, sweetheart.
Frank, I want to apologise.
I don't want to be the woman of tomorrow.
I just want to enjoy today.
Phyllis, I'm glad to hear you say that.
It may be later than we think.
Frank, did you see a goose on the patio?
I thought I did.
Then there's only one thing to be said, dear.
If we're going over the hill, it's nice to be going together.
They're only going over the hill.
I'm going off my rocker.
Yoo-hoo.
Esmeralda?
Samantha, what are you doing?
Well, I'm just trying to get Esmeralda back so you can thank her.
- For what?
- Darrin, when your mother arrived this afternoon, she was a tragic figure, her marriage beyond repair.
And now, thanks to Esmeralda, two happy people just walked arm in arm out of our front door onto the Not one more word.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Sam!
Darrin.
Look what you made me do.
You wouldn't have done what you did if you hadn't done what you did.
Well, I just got tired running up and down that ladder, and I lost my head.
Sam, when are you going Sweetheart, why don't you just go out and come back and we'll forget this ever happened?
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Morning, sweetheart.
- I'll bet you don't know what today is.
- Let's see.
It's too late for Groundhog Day and too early for National Frankfurter Week.
What day is it?
It's exactly three days, eight hours and 45 minutes since your mother last inflicted herself on us.
Now, Darrin, I know Mother can be a bit difficult, but All right, all right.
She can be a lot difficult but she is my mother and she's not without a certain charm.
I had hoped that you might come to like her a little.
I like her a little.
- Very little.
- Very little.
I guess what bugs me the most is the way she barges in without any advance notice.
Well "Advance notice.
I am barging.
Endora".
Darrin, for once try to be agreeable.
No matter what she says, just agree.
Please.
Okay.
But believe me, it won't help.
Samantha, my love.
How are you?
Oh, I'm sorry if I disturbed your stupor.
Good morning, Endora.
How nice you dropped in.
You're a sight for sore eyes that brightens an otherwise bleak morning.
Keep that up and you'll be a monkey's uncle.
Darrin, you'll be late for work.
Yes, but it's worth it to make your mother feel welcome.
Endora, won't you sit down and rest your weary bones?
That does it.
Now he's saying I'm too decrepit to stand.
Sweetheart, you can't win.
Why don't you go to work?
Okay.
Bye, sweetheart.
Bye, Endora.
You lay a lip on me and I'll put you in orbit for the rest of your life.
I was just reaching for my paper.
What in the name of all that's witchly has gotten into him?
Nothing.
Darrin happens to be an extremely agreeable person.
Everyone thinks so.
His business associates, his friends.
Everyone but you.
- Now, don't you think you might be wrong?
- Why?
Columbus was the only one that thought the world was round and he was right.
It's no use.
- Excuse me, Mother.
- Yes.
So agreeable, is he?
Well, if he really were, he'd take a nice, long, one-way trip.
Or maybe Yes!
I'll zap him into such an agreeable state, he'll be utterly sickening.
That was Mrs Kravitz.
She had this crazy civic improvement petition.
I told her I wouldn't sign it without consulting you.
I'd better duck out the back way.
And I'm gonna give Adam his bottle.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Just going out the back way.
Saying goodbye to you once is bad enough, but twice is revolting.
Endora, I'd love to stay and bicker, but Bee's knees and bell's knell, hearken to my tricky spell.
To prove your brain's the size of a pea, with all you hear, you will agree.
- Excuse me.
Gotta run.
- Wait!
See how cloudy it is?
It might rain.
Yeah, it might.
I'd better get an umbrella.
Whatever for?
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
You're absolutely right.
Bye-bye, Endora.
Goodbye, Durwood.
Good luck.
Oh!
Mr Stephens!
Mr Stephens!
Your wife said you already left, but here you are.
That's right.
What can I do for you, Mrs Kravitz?
I wanted to ask you to sign this petition.
We're trying to get the city to do something about the bus stops.
Now I don't know how often you've had to wait for a bus, but those benches are terribly uncomfortable and we of the Civic lmprovement Committee feel that they should be upholstered.
- Upholstered bus benches?
- Yes.
Wouldn't that be nice?
Oh, I agree.
Where do I sign?
Would you be interested in circulating one of these petitions?
Of course.
Now if you'll excuse me, Mrs Kravitz, I've got to get to work.
Oh, sure.
I'm sorry I held you up.
But these things are terribly important.
Oh, I know.
I couldn't agree more.
- Yes?
- Mrs Stephens is on the phone.
Thank you.
Hi, hon.
What's up?
Well, frankly, I'm a little puzzled.
Gladys Kravitz came back and left a petition.
She said you agreed to get signatures.
That's right, I did.
You're gonna ask people you know to sign a petition for upholstered bus benches?
Don't you think that's a little ridiculous?
It's a lot ridiculous.
Then why did you agree to take the petition?
I don't know.
Just to be agreeable, I guess.
Well, that's fine, sweetheart, but I think you went a little overboard.
She's also put you on the Save the Starlings committee.
The Starlings?
What street do they live on?
They are birds.
They fly into glass buildings and get hurt.
She wants the city to condemn buildings made of glass.
- That's very interesting.
- It's absurd.
That's what I mean.
It's absurdly interesting.
Just a minute.
Yes?
Mr Tate would like to see you in the office right away.
Okay.
I've gotta run, Sam.
Talk to you later.
Bye.
Hi, Larry.
Oh.
New clubs?
Yes.
You know me.
I'm always trying to improve my game.
You ought to try cheating.
It's cheaper.
You know, I thought we might go over a few things before Shotwell arrives.
Good idea.
I'm anxious to turn this account over to you, but it's got to be handled delicately.
Darrin, you've got to be diplomatic.
Without compromising your principles, of course.
- Larry, I agree with you 100%.
- You do?
That's great.
You know how much I respect your integrity.
But let's face it, sometimes you go overboard.
You're right, Larry.
I do.
Well, I'm glad to hear you admit that, for once.
- Yes?
- Mr Shotwell is here.
Ask him to come right in.
Oh, just one last thing.
He claims he doesn't like yes men.
But the truth is, he hates people who disagree with him even more.
So I want you to be Mr Shotwell!
Good to see you.
This is Darrin Stephens.
Heard a lot of good things about you, young fellow.
- Well, thanks.
- Any of it true?
- Have a seat, Mr Shotwell.
- I certainly hope so.
And Larry has filled me in on what a dynamic and inspiring person you are.
- That's a lot of baloney.
- It certainly is.
I forgot to tell you about Stephens' sense of humour.
It's a little peculiar.
But you know these geniuses.
- Frankly, I find geniuses a pain in the neck.
- So do I. They're also the only ones who come up with original ideas.
Exactly.
The world needs geniuses.
Apparently there's one thing they didn't tell you about me, Stephens.
I don't like yes men.
I'm well aware of that, sir, and I happen to share that feeling.
Let's get down to business, shall we?
You know my feeling that the advertising campaigns of Shotwell Pharmaceuticals can use some new blood.
That's why I brought Stephens into the picture.
He's roughed out some ideas with a younger, fresher approach and I'll turn the floor over to him.
You think our approach has been too conservative, do you?
- Yes.
I completely agree with Mr Tate.
- Well, I don't.
- You're absolutely right.
- What?
Listen, why get bogged down in semantics, huh?
Explain your approach to Mr Shotwell and show him some of your layouts.
Certainly.
First of all, let's take a look at your slogan.
"Oldest pharmaceutical establishment in America".
Now, that's a dignified, impressive concept.
But in today's jargon, the word "establishment" has negative connotations, particularly to the young people.
Three-quarters of our customers are over 40.
Yes, and that's why I say never change your slogan.
Well, I have just one thing to say.
If you're that anxious to get off my account, I'll make it easy for you.
You'll have a letter of cancellation in the morning.
Now wait a minute, Mr Shotwell.
Never mind Stephens.
I'll stay on the account myself and I promise you I'll do everything to Congratulations.
In three minutes, you managed to destroy a 21-year relationship.
Why?
Why did you have to be so darned agreeable?
I certainly did agree a lot, didn't I?
I don't know whether to strangle you or fire you.
Either one's okay with me, Larry.
That's the first thing you've agreed to that makes sense.
But I can't fire an old friend, so why don't you take a little vacation till I cool off?
Okay.
How long?
A year or two should do it.
Then he suggested I take a little vacation till he cooled off.
- How long a vacation?
- A year or two.
Darrin, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you've been fired.
Yeah.
I know.
What happened exactly?
Well, Larry pleaded with me to be diplomatic.
He said Shotwell hated people who disagreed with him and, well, I guess I went a little overboard.
Actually, then Larry's just as much to blame as you are, isn't he?
You're right.
- Maybe it's time you made a change.
- I agree.
What kind of a change?
- Well, a change in jobs.
What else?
- You're absolutely right.
As a matter of fact, I know where there's an opening.
Stone, Fraser, Moreheim, Cooper, Cooper and Washburn.
They don't sound like they have room for anyone else.
- One of the top outfits in the country.
- I see.
I've got to check around to see if anyone can drop my name with Washburn.
He's the one that counts.
Sweetheart, as long as you're home, do you mind if I go out for a little while?
I have a few errands to run.
- No, go ahead.
- Okay.
See you later.
Bye, sweetheart!
- Oh, Mr Washburn.
- Yes?
The mayor's on the phone.
Tell him I've left for lunch.
I'll call him back later.
- Where will you be lunching?
- The usual place.
Well, I'll see you later.
And enjoy your Darrin Stephens.
- What?
- I said, enjoy your lunch.
How long has it been since Wiley's had a vacation?
She just came back from one.
Must have had a wild time.
- Let me see that list of candidates.
- Yes.
Parker, party of two.
Darrin, party of Stephens.
- Table for one?
- No, thank you.
I'm waiting for someone.
- Ready to order?
- Yeah.
I'll have another drink.
- Make it a double.
- You think that's a good idea?
A little Darrin or two makes a better Stephens, I always say.
Maybe you're right.
Forget the drink.
I'll have the swordfish.
Yes, sir.
Would you like that à la carte or on the Darrin?
- What?
- À la carte or on the dinner?
- Fine.
Either way.
- And for you, sir?
I'll have the steak sandwich and more coffee.
Thank you.
Enjoy your Darrin Stephens now.
What's your feeling?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I think that far and away, the best man for us is Darrin Stephens.
- Who?
- Darrin Stephens.
He's not even on the list.
Well, why isn't he?
He's far and away the best man for us.
Sam?
Hi, sweetheart.
You want to hear a fantastic coincidence?
Washburn just called me.
The agency I told you about?
I start tomorrow!
- He hired you over the phone?
- Yes.
He seemed very insistent about it.
Well, that's marvellous.
I certainly hope that Hi, Mrs Stephens.
I just came by to tell Mr Stephens the good news.
Oh?
What's that?
I've just been made chairman of the Save the Starlings committee.
Well, this is really your lucky day.
See you at the meeting.
Bye.
Darrin, why did you agree to be chairman of that ridiculous committee?
Well, because she asked me to.
- Suppose she asked you to jump in a lake.
- There's no lake near here.
You know something?
Either you're having a nervous breakdown or my mother has struck again.
Tell me, did you and Mr Washburn agree on a salary?
Yes.
And it's only a few thousand less than I'm making now.
That does it.
Mother!
I thought I'd be hearing from you.
- Take it off.
- In mixed company?
Now, Mother, you know very well what I am talking about.
You put a spell on Darrin to make him agree with anything or anyone.
And you object?
Mother, the depth of your lack of feeling is not to be believed.
Do you realise that your feeble little joke has cost Darrin his job?
Oh, Samantha, stop making so much ado about nothing.
Sam What kind of an incantation is that?
Samantha, I refuse to stay here and bicker.
Are you all right?
- It's none of your business!
- What?
- Don't stand there gaping.
Get me a drink.
- Oh, no!
Mother.
Mother, what have you done to him?
Oh, good grief.
It's "reverse the spell" backwards.
What the devil are you mumbling about?
Would you get that, Sam?
I'm busy.
Hi, Sam.
Is Darrin Oh, there you are!
I was just driving by on my way home and I thought I'd drop in.
This isn't on your way home.
Darrin, I think Larry's trying to make a gesture.
Yes?
Well, I'm making one, too.
Goodbye.
Well, of all the ungracious, disagreeable This morning you fired me for being too agreeable.
Who said I fired you?
What do you call a two-year vacation without pay?
So I lost my temper.
Now I'm apologising.
Not interested in your apology.
Sam, for the sake of your family, you ought to have a talk with him.
Jobs like his don't grow on trees.
Larry, I wish you'd gotten here a few minutes earlier.
- Well, Shotwell didn't call me till - Shotwell called you?
- Yes.
- He liked the layouts, right?
Well, to be perfectly frank, yes.
Well, well, well.
Now, why don't you stop this, both of you, and admit that, basically, you have a great affection and admiration for each other?
Darrin, I'm sorry.
I'll see you first thing in the morning, right?
Wrong.
He's starting in again!
All right, Mother, you've had your kicks.
Now you better come and clean up this mess, or you're gonna hear a lot of yelling.
Mother!
Samantha, you're such a killjoy.
Really.
- Mother!
- I'm doing it.
I'm doing it, I'm doing it.
Bee's knees and bell's knell, I order you to remove the spell.
Return this mortal to his normal state.
If this doesn't work, I simply can't wait.
What was I saying?
How good it is to have Darrin back.
- Yeah.
Good to have you back, old friend.
- Good to be back, Larry.
- You can't bust up a team like ours.
- No way.
Come on.
I'll make you a drink.
We have our differences, sure.
And a lot of relationships might not survive them.
But with us it only serves to sharpen our appreciation of each other.
Because we know that deep in our hearts, we have that kind of common bond that's rare in this world.
And why?
The answer's as simple as it is beautiful.
Because we have respect for each other's ideas and opinions.
- But most of all - You get out.
we're sensitive to each other's feelings.
And all this adds up to one thing, Darrin, the team.
Yeah.
The team.
You and me.
And my mother.
Sweetheart, I don't blame you for being upset.
There are times when Mother just goes too far.
You're implying there are times when she doesn't?
You think she dislikes you, but you're wrong.
She likes me?
Well, I didn't say that.
She just doesn't care for mortals, and you happen to be one.
Well, I'm going to be one as long as I live.
You know, I know there's no hope of her learning to like me, but do you think in time she'd learn to ignore me?
Sweetheart, Esmeralda is babysitting and we're all set for a lovely evening out.
So let's just put Mother out of our minds.
There's only one way to do that.
We've got to put Mother out of our minds more often.
- Mrs Kravitz.
- Where are you going?
- Out to dinner.
- You can't!
You promised to address the Save the Starling committee.
- When did I do that?
- This afternoon.
Mrs Kravitz, when I agreed, I really didn't know what I What Darrin is trying to say, Mrs Kravitz, is that when he said he'd do it, he was really under Under Yes?
Sweetheart, why don't you go over there and say a few words to the committee?
You'll come?
Oh, good!
I'll just run over and tell them you're on your way.
Sam, I don't know anything about starlings.
Then you're even.
They don't know anything about you either.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
It's gonna be such fun.
I want you to look over there and see the pretty tree.
See the pretty tree with all the lights and everything?
There are some presents down there, too.
That's gonna be fun.
Oh, my goodness me.
Catch you under the mistletoe.
Yes.
Oh, my goodness, aren't they pretty?
Red and yellow and green and blue and all sorts of colours.
Well, come on and tell me about it.
Yeah.
All the pretty Christmas lights.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
Oh, my.
Babies are such a nice way to start people.
Mommy!
Mommy!
But they do grow up, don't they?
I'm never going to play with Sidney again.
He's mean and terrible.
Oh, my.
Now, what has Sidney done that is so terrible?
He said there was no Santa Claus.
Even after I told him we know Santa and you've been to his house at the North Pole, he still didn't believe me.
Tabitha, now, don't you remember what I've told you about our little secrets?
If you tell them to someone else, they won't be secrets any more.
I'm sorry, Mommy.
But that terrible old Sidney just made me mad.
Sweetheart, everyone is entitled to believe in what they want.
Now, if they don't want to believe, that's all right, too.
Now, when it comes to Santa Claus, most mortals don't believe he exists just like they don't believe in witches.
Now do you understand?
Which reminds me.
I am gonna get Esmeralda to come and help out for a few days.
- Goody!
- Yoo-hoo!
Esmeralda?
- Hello, Samantha.
Is - No.
No, he's not home from work yet.
Oh, good.
Esmeralda, I'm a little behind in my shopping.
- Would you mind staying a couple of days?
- Always a pleasure.
- Hello, my little princess.
- Hello, Esmeralda.
- And how is my handsome little warlock?
- Just about to have his lunch.
And, incidentally, there's a 50-50 chance he might be mortal, you know.
Oh, there is?
Poor thing.
It would be such a Such a - Esmeralda, don't!
- Such a What did you get this time?
Do you think the baby would like a bottle of goat's milk?
Terrific.
When Darrin gets home, try and stay out of drafts.
Oh, you didn't tell me he was coming home.
Well, that's what he usually does when he gets through work.
Oh, my.
Esmeralda, why don't you take Tabitha upstairs and get started with her bath?
All right.
Come along, dearie.
See?
That is a goat.
See?
That was a goat.
Well, Esmeralda's witchcraft may not be very good but it doesn't last.
How about that?
How about that?
Do you think that was funny?
Did you think that was funny?
I thought that was funny.
Larry's giving you a mink stole for Christmas?
Oh, Louise, that's wonderful.
He's such a dear.
He's not a dear?
Why is he furious?
Well, maybe you should have consulted him before you bought it.
- Sam!
- Oh, dear.
I gotta go.
Yes, Louise.
I'll tell Darrin to talk to Larry.
Maybe he can convince him that a mink coat and a mink stole are two different things.
Bye, Louise.
Esmeralda, haven't you learned yet that Mr Stephens really likes you?
Well, he doesn't show it.
Well, how can he show it when you pop out every time you hear his voice?
That's better.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- How about a nice double martini?
- What's wrong?
Sam, I thought you were gonna warn me when Esmeralda was here.
I thought offering you a double martini would be enough of a warning.
I wonder what she's sneezed up this time.
I'm afraid to think.
Oh, now, sweetheart, try and control your temper.
Remember, "peace on earth, good will toward men" includes witches.
Isn't that cute?
Christmas seals.
Can I keep them, Daddy?
Well, they won't last, sweetheart.
None of her spells ever do.
Mostly.
See?
There was nothing for you to get uptight about.
Sam, I'll take that martini now and you can leave out the vermouth.
I'm glad you're staying, 'cause I want you to be here when Santa Claus comes tomorrow night.
Oh, yes.
I haven't seen Santa Claus in a good number of years.
As a matter of fact, I can't remember when I Is there anything else I can do for you, sweetheart?
Yeah.
Start making another one.
Better make a whole pitcherful.
Sweetheart, why don't you finish your drink, and I'll go and check in the kitchen.
I'd rather see this when I'm sober.
Samantha, is that the real Samantha, my dear girl, how are you?
That's who it is all right.
Oh, just fine, Santa.
- How's Mrs Claus?
- Fine.
She's gonna be a little surprised when she wakes up from her nap.
I don't usually go on trips during my busy season.
Well, my dear girl, I'm afraid I shall have to be getting back.
Do you want to tell him, or should I?
Actually, I think you're going to find this very amusing.
You see, when Esmeralda materialises someone, it's usually by accident.
Frequently.
But then in a little while they just fade away and go back where they came from.
Well, that is amusing.
In a little while, eh?
The longest it's ever taken is a couple of days.
What?
Do you tell me I could be stuck here all that time?
- Impossible!
- What happened to "ho, ho, ho"?
Oh, my dear girl, you're a witch.
Do something.
Well, you see, this was Esmeralda's doing and no one else has any power over it.
Now, if you sit down and relax, the spell will have a better chance of wearing off.
We should leave them alone.
Come on, sweetheart.
You mean a watched pot never boils?
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
Sweetheart, why don't you go upstairs and get ready for dinner, and Tabitha and I will give the baby his bath.
I'll get it.
Hi, Mrs Kravitz.
We're a little busy right now, so I just wanted to remind you about the contest.
Contest?
For the best decorated house in the neighbourhood.
Don't you remember I talked to you about it a couple of weeks ago?
Oh, yes.
I'll talk to Mr Stephens about it.
Oh, there he is now.
What's he doing?
Trying on his costume?
- Nothing's happened so far, Samantha - May I compliment you?
Anyone who's gone to that much trouble just to please his children is certainly to be complimented.
Mrs Kravitz, we were just about to sit down to dinner, so I'm going.
You know, that's the most convincing Santa suit I've ever seen.
- Real ermine?
What's that?
Foam rubber?
- I beg your pardon!
Mrs Kravitz, you'll have to excuse us.
Wonderful.
It's just wonderful.
But how does he do that with his voice?
He runs around in the snow and catches cold.
Good night, Mrs Kravitz.
Oh, good grief.
Do you realise that I still have thousands of toys to make before tomorrow night?
My helpers at the Pole won't know how to proceed without me.
I assure you, Santa.
The spell can't last much longer.
That's what you said a couple of hours ago.
Well, maybe instead of toys, you could leave each child a gift certificate.
Excuse me.
- It's Larry.
- It's Larry.
I forgot.
We're supposed to convince him to keep the mink Louise bought as a surprise.
- Larry wants a mink?
- No, Louise does.
Just tell him we're about to sit down to dinner.
Hi, Darrin.
I was just on my way home, and Oh, Larry, we're just about to sit down to dinner.
No, no, no.
I couldn't eat a thing, but I'll take a drink.
I just had to get away from the mass hysteria that seizes the entire population during this so-called season of mirth.
I tell you, I'm sick of it.
Sick of the crass commercialism that's invaded the Christmas holiday.
Does this have anything to do with Louise's mink?
So you're one of the thousands of select people that Louise has complained to.
- What are you drinking?
- Anything.
Triple.
Oh, Samantha, what am I going to do?
There are thousands and thousands of children depending on me.
Oh, if only I had my workers here and some tools.
- Would that help?
- Well, of course.
I might be able to manage that.
Really?
Oh, that would be splendid!
There's something I have to take care of first.
- Aren't you and Louise on speaking terms?
- She is.
I'm on listening terms.
Larry, don't you think that Louise is gonna be worried about where you are?
All Louise cares about is what she can get out of me.
- I happen to know she also cares about you.
- Yeah.
She likes me for what I am, rich.
But you're right.
I ought to go home so she'll have someone to interrupt.
I'll walk you to your car.
Okay, let's give it a whirl.
Stars, sun, wind and tide in the heavens where you abide.
Before your powers we do bow.
Bring Santa's helpers here and now.
That was beautiful.
- Where have you been?
- We've been looking all over for you!
Oh, Darrin, there's something I have to Sweetheart, I had to do it because Santa would have lost a lot of valuable time and thousands of children would have been disappointed.
Now, the only reason I didn't discuss it with you first was I knew you'd forbid me to do it and I'd have to disobey you, and you know I'd never do that.
Now how about some dinner?
Samantha, for your sake, for Santa's sake and for the sake of my sanity, I'm going to bed.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
That's all right.
I was having a terrible nightmare anyway.
I wonder how Santa and his elves are doing.
Now that you mention it, that nightmare wasn't so terrible.
I'll go and check.
I'm kind of curious anyway.
I don't see how they can turn out that many toys in so short a time.
Abner!
Abner, wake up!
They've got elves!
Elves in the living room making toys!
And elves!
And Santa Claus!
And they're all running around like jumping jacks!
Gladys, you'd better loosen your rollers.
Your hair is too tight.
The coast is clear.
I got Darrin to go to the store for me.
Now what?
Well, I have been giving this a lot of thought.
Now, Esmeralda's mistakes usually fade long before this so we'll just have to face the possibility that you're not going to.
Are you telling me the whole night's work has been for naught?
Oh, no.
I have an alternate plan.
If I can materialise your sleigh and reindeer, you'll have your own wheels, so to speak.
That's all I need.
I think it's a disgrace the way they just refuse to make an effort to beautify the neighbourhood for Christmas.
If you cared about beautifying the neighbourhood, you'd move.
Abner, that's not a very funny joke.
So what?
You didn't pay anything to hear it.
I'm going to get the paper.
Come, Dasher!
Come, Dancer!
Come, Prancer and Vixen!
Come, Comet!
Come, Cupid!
Come, Donner and Blitzen!
To the lawn of the house where Santa is stuck.
Be sure if you fly, the antennas you duck.
What are you complaining about?
I think the Stephenses did a terrific job with their Christmas decorations.
What?
- But why on the lawn?
- Because there wasn't room out back.
And when Mrs Kravitz sees it, we're gonna win first prize for the best decorated house in the neighbourhood.
But it wasn't there a minute ago.
Gladys, let's play house.
You be the door and I'll shut you.
Can they at least hold the loading until it gets completely dark?
Lmpossible.
I have to make a stop at the North Pole and encircle the globe between now and morning.
There's nobody out there now.
You ready?
One, two, three, go!
- Abner!
Where are you?
- In the cellar.
What do you want?
Come here!
You won't believe this!
If I won't believe it, do you mind if I save myself a climb?
Goodbye, Santa.
And I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience.
Oh, that's all right, my dear.
It'll make an interesting chapter when I write my memoirs.
Although, quite frankly, I don't think anyone would believe it.
All right!
Hold tight!
- A merry Christmas to all!
- Cool it, Santa.
You've got to be kidding!
We're having a contest in the neighbourhood.
Well, you're sure out to win it, aren't you?
I've seen people go hog-wild with Christmas decorations, but this is ridiculous.
Darrin, why don't you take Larry in and give him a brandy eggnog?
No, thanks.
I've already had a couple.
Louise had me up all night yapping about that mink stole.
- I'll make one for you without the eggnog.
- Now you're talking.
Santa, if we didn't have you, we'd have to make you up.
Goodbye, Santa!
- That was a good eggnog.
- Have another.
- Mommy!
Daddy!
- Yes, sweetheart?
Santa's leaving.
Don't you want to say goodbye?
What's that?
Oh, you mean that thing in the sky.
We've been seeing a lot of that lately.
They say it's a new rocket the Air Force is testing.
Or maybe Maybe it's Santa and his reindeer.
Yeah.
Our new secret weapon.
Santa and his Hey, your Christmas display.
It's gone.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you see, they get time-and-a-half for night work, so I let them go.
Well, that thing that was flying through the sky sure looked like - Like - Yes, Larry?
Couldn't be.
But for a minute, you really thought it was Santa Claus, didn't you?
Well, for a minute, maybe, but I think I'd better run along.
I've still got to pick up Louise's present.
Just what are you getting her?
- Oh, it's a little sort of a - Yes?
Well, you know, it kind of goes around her shoulders and Well, I've forgotten what they call it.
- But it's made of fur?
- And it's very expensive?
Yeah.
I I told you it wasn't the money.
I just wanted it to be a surprise.
- Sure.
- Merry Christmas, Larry.
Well, a merry Christmas to all and to all a good night.
Gee, that does sound better than "humbug".
Oh, my.
Well, Christmas comes but once a year.
Sweetheart, do you realise that you are the only mortal who can say he has actually met Santa Claus?
Yeah.
That's true.
Who can I say it to?
- No, it isn't.
It's Clementine.
- We're gonna call her Cindy.
Oh, well, okay.
Sweetheart, you know, you've had a big day and I think it's time you went up and got ready for bed.
- Can I play a few more minutes?
- Oh, well, all right, a few more minutes.
- Do you want to hear something wild?
- What is it?
Listen, "Thousands report celestial phenomenon.
"Police and army switchboards were jammed yesterday "by callers reporting an unusual sight in the heavens.
"Most callers identified the object as a UFO "but some insisted that they had actually seen Santa Claus and his reindeer "riding across the sky".
How do you like that?
Well, as I have always said, mortals are the funniest people and the nicest.
Thank you for making this such a lovely Christmas.
Oh, I forgot to ask you.
Can Sidney come over and play tomorrow?
You're friends again?
He finally admitted there's a Santa Claus.
How come?
Well, he kept saying, "There's no Santa!
There's no Santa!
There's no Santa"!
So I turned him into a mushroom and he finally admitted he was wrong.
- Tabitha, how many times have you - Now, Darrin, it's Christmas.
Okay.
But tomorrow, young lady, you and I are going to have a serious witch-to-witch talk.
From all of us to all of you, a very merry Christmas.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
I don't know how you can sit there so calmly.
This will be our first real vacation in five years.
Do you realise where we'll be tomorrow night at this time?
Sitting under a Caribbean moon with no thoughts of diapers, dinners or demand feedings.
Yeah, we'll be guzzling exotic rum drinks a thousand miles away from layouts, business lunches and Larry.
Do you realise that he is the reason we haven't had a vacation in five years?
Somehow he always manages to work it out so that we can't go.
Well, not this time.
We're leaving tomorrow morning.
I just have a feeling the phone's going to ring any minute.
- There.
You see?
- That's the doorbell.
Forget it.
We're going on our vacation, and nothing you can do is going to stop us.
Bravo!
Have you two gone bananas?
Is this the way you treat someone who's come all this way to wish you bon voyage?
I'm sorry, Larry.
I guess we both lost our heads.
Yes.
We're both a little lightheaded.
Don't blame you.
You're gonna have a terrific time.
I know.
I can't think of two people who deserve it more.
That's darn nice of you.
- Louise sends her best.
- Well, thank her.
How is she?
- Fair.
- Fair?
She got a little upper respiratory something.
Well, that's a shame.
Yeah, kind of hate to leave her, but first thing tomorrow morning, off I go to Chicago.
- Can't you take her with you?
- She's not well enough to travel.
Why don't you put off the trip to Chicago?
Well, don't you remember?
The only reason I'm going is because you couldn't.
Yeah.
But, listen, I didn't come here to burden you.
Just brought a little going-away present.
It's a portable bar.
To make those carefree, happy moments even happier, and carefree-er.
- How about that?
- Wow!
Larry, that's very sweet.
It's on the company.
Well, gotta go.
I have to stop by the pharmacy and pick up a prescription.
Sam, I'd appreciate it if you'd look in on Louise while I'm What's the matter with me?
You won't even be here.
Maybe I'll call my mother and ask her to No, she'd only make Louise feel worse.
Well, Louise is used to being alone, as long as the phone is working and she can reach the doctor in an emergency.
- That's all that - Larry?
Yes?
You want me to go to Chicago for you, don't you?
- Where'd you ever get an idea like that?
- He just made a wild stab.
Believe me, the thought never entered my mind.
Unless Wait a minute.
You mean you would make a stop in Chicago on your way to the Caribbean?
Chicago is on the way to the Caribbean only if you're going around the world first.
Sure.
I was just dreaming.
Well, have a ball.
Think of me on the icy streets of Chicago.
I won't be leaving till 10:00 in the morning, just for your information, in case you need anything.
Good night, you two beautiful people.
- Do you believe it?
- Only because I heard it.
And I think, before we leave, we're gonna hear it again.
Well, as far as I'm concerned, he's just shouting down a rain barrel.
Well, at least we got a portable bar out of it.
Just the same, it's going to be interesting to see who's on that plane to Chicago tomorrow morning.
I guarantee you it won't be me, unless there's a way I can be in two places at the same time.
- Darrin.
- Who's going to hear me?
The walls have ears and so has my mother.
Remember what happened the last time you said you couldn't be in two places at once?
Remember?
Lt'd be easier to forget my name.
Well, it did have its funny side, too.
You were so anxious for me to get to that hospital on time to have that baby that you didn't even want to go to work.
There I was bragging to Mother about what a devoted husband you are, when you barged in and announced Sam, I don't know how to tell you this, but Well, I have to fly to Japan this afternoon.
- Japan?
- Well, it's only for a few days.
And only this morning he didn't want to leave you to go to the office.
What a difference a day makes.
I tried everything I could to get out of it.
I reasoned, I argued, I You did everything but refuse.
I couldn't refuse, Sam.
Mr Tanaka, president of Tanaka Enterprises, is going back to Japan today, and if I make the trip with him, we'll be able to go over my layouts on the plane and it might just clinch the deal.
Sweetheart, you have no choice.
Go.
Yes.
Go.
Samantha will be in the best possible hands.
I won't leave her side for a minute.
That settles it.
I'm staying.
Now, Darrin, I feel marvellous, just perfect.
You go to Japan, land the account and don't worry about a thing.
Sam, I'm not going.
What kind of a man does Larry think I am?
Only an insensitive oaf would go to Japan at a time like this.
In that case, bon voyage!
And give my regards to the Ginza.
Mother.
Tabitha, are you playing with the hose?
Yes, Mommy.
I'm watering my sand.
We'll discuss this in a minute, over lunch.
I think I'll make lunch.
Sam looks tired.
That money-mad boss of yours won't exactly love it if you don't show up on that plane.
Well, let him fire me.
Sam is more important to me than any job.
Too bad you can't be in two places at once.
Well, we can't have everything.
That's one thing we mortals learned to accept long ago.
Atoms split, and so can man.
Be in both places, here and Japan.
One for the money, two for the show, doting husband stay, businessman go.
Who says we can't have everything?
There's more sand in my shoes than in the box.
Maybe you should play in your shoes.
Here you go.
Come on.
- Sam, I've gotta run or I'll miss my plane.
- What plane?
- I'm flying to Tokyo.
- You decided to go?
I'll miss you, honey, but business is business.
- What made you change your mind?
- I don't know exactly.
Well, it's just too big an account to lose.
I've gotta run.
I'll call you from Japan.
Excuse me.
And good riddance.
Sam, I made our lunch.
Do you want it on the patio?
What are you doing here?
- I thought you were going to Tokyo.
- You did?
What gave you that idea?
I guess I got the idea when you said, "I'm going to Tokyo".
Well, I told you I wasn't going.
Say, haven't we been through all this?
Yes, we certainly have.
Then why are we going through it again?
- I don't know yet.
- I'll get the lunch.
Tabitha, why don't you run out to the kitchen and help Daddy?
Okay, Mommy.
- Mother, I would like a word with you.
- Of course, darling.
Admit it, Mother, you divided Darrin.
I don't see why you're so upset.
But he'll be furious!
I'll admit that made it irresistible.
All right, Mother, you've had your fun.
Now put him back together.
Samantha, what harm can it do?
Half of him wanted to stay home, and half of him wanted to make a business deal in Tokyo.
You should thank me.
Tabitha, will you open the door?
Darrin.
- Do you feel any different?
- Different than what?
Never mind.
The business Darwin is on his way to Tokyo.
The doting Darwin is here at home.
What could be more logical?
- That's pretty weird logic.
- That's because it's so sensible.
Well?
Samantha, he works so hard.
He deserves his bonus.
Come and get it!
- Anything for you, sir?
- No, thanks.
Now, our sales approach should stress the quality factor of Tanaka Electronics.
If we could stress the high degree of quality control that exists on the assembly line of each and every Tanaka product, then I think we'll be in business.
- Now, this graph shows your - Not now.
No.
Well, how about this graph?
It indicates your sales posture for the last year.
Mr Stephens, please.
At the moment it's not sales posture I'm interested in.
It's delicious, sweetheart.
- There wasn't too much salt in the omelette?
- No, no.
It's just fine.
- The coffee, it isn't too strong?
- I love strong coffee.
As a matter of fact, it's so good I think I'll save it for lunch.
Okay, now you go into the living room, and sit down and make yourself comfortable while I do the dishes.
Sweetheart, it's enough that you cooked breakfast.
I will not have you washing the dishes.
And I will not have you walking around any more than you have to.
Just sit you right down here, and get the weight off those feet.
It's a little chilly in here.
I'll get you a blanket.
Don't bother, sweetheart.
I'm fine.
No, no, no, no.
I'll make a fire.
That'll make it all nice and warm and cosy.
Darrin.
I'm already nice and warm and cosy.
As a matter of fact, I'm getting a little hot.
You're hot?
I'll open the patio door.
Why don't you build a fire and open the patio door at the same time?
- That way you'll have everything.
- Mother.
Good morning, Endora.
It's always nice to see you.
What did I do to deserve that?
As if you didn't know.
Sweetheart, I have an idea.
- Why don't you - Anything.
Anything.
I was just going to suggest that you go out and play golf.
Oh, no.
I couldn't play golf.
I'd be worried sick about you.
But, sweetheart, I feel fine.
And the only thing that would make me feel great would be if you went out and played golf.
Now, I would really enjoy sitting here, thinking about that.
Well, all right, but I'm only playing golf for you.
I'll get my clubs.
You sure I can't get you something, Sam?
A little coffee, a little warm milk?
A little peace.
Nothing, sweetheart.
- Mother, put him back together.
- Why?
Because I only want one Darrin.
I know what you mean, dear.
It's humiliating to look as if you've made the same mistake twice.
Put him back!
Very well.
Where do you want him?
In Japan, of course, so he can finish his business deal.
Samantha, I'll have to zonk him across the international dateline.
That isn't going to be easy.
- See you later, honey.
- Wait a minute.
What?
What?
Before you go, would you mind fixing me some tea?
Certainly.
Hot tea or ice tea?
They're both good.
I'll make both.
- How about you, Endora?
- I'll pass.
Hot tea and ice tea.
Ice tea and hot tea - Quick!
Quick, Mother, with the spell!
- Don't rush me.
Don't rush me.
I might get spellbound.
It's so clever.
Spellbound?
Okay.
I have a campaign in mind to show the consumer the growing importance of electronics in his daily life.
Now, to the average person, electronics is something they feel is just beyond their intelligence.
What I plan to accomplish is to Well, to humanize, so to speak Mr Stephens, would you mind taking your plate from my wife?
As you can see, she's quite pregnant, and at this time, it's difficult for her to bend and place it before you.
Of course.
I understand.
My wife is pregnant, too.
Good.
I'm glad to see you're not all work.
That's cute.
Now, on page seven - Hurry up, Mother.
- Believe me, Samantha.
It would be much easier to zap the working Durwood back from Japan.
- That's merely a reverse-the-spell spell.
- Hold it.
Here you are, sweetheart.
I didn't know what you wanted, so I brought sugar and cream and lemon.
There.
Here, let me get those pillows.
I'll put them behind your back, then you'll be all nice and comfy.
Darrin?
Would you mind toasting me a couple of crumpets, well-done?
Coming up.
Thank you, Mrs Tanaka for a very delicious dinner.
- Now, let's get back to business.
- Here, dear.
Let me help you with that.
If you'll excuse me, Mr Stephens, I will assist my wife with the dishes.
You see how much I've learned from your Western culture?
But I haven't even told you our ideas for radio and television advertising yet.
You're all business, aren't you, Mr Stephens?
You really should learn how to play a little.
Sirloins and sapphires and all things rare, take the Durwood from here and send him back there.
Your crumpets are on, honey.
I'll put the clubs away.
I've decided I don't want to play golf.
Anyway I'm sorry it took me so long, but But I'm glad to see you had time to change into something more comfortable.
Mr Stephens, may I ask where you got those golf clubs and how you changed so quickly?
Clubs Well, let's see now.
I got the golf clubs at a little pro shop where I play golf.
Change, I And change.
I Well, I liked I've always liked to change.
- Well, after all, the world is changing.
- Yes.
Nice place you have.
Very Oriental.
- Sweetheart, calm down.
- Calm down.
Calm down?
When Madame Lafarge of the broomstick set zaps me back from Tokyo when I'm right in the middle of a big business deal Well, let's not upset Madame Mother, when we want her to Upset her?
Upset her?
What about the shock Tanaka's gonna get when - Mother!
- What?
- Is he gonna remember any of this?
- Not a thing.
And not to mention the shock that Larry's gonna get Quiet!
All right, Mother.
It's zap-it-to-him time.
Mr Stephens?
You seem rather upset to me.
I have a feeling you're very concerned about your wife.
I am, very.
I'm very concerned about what I'm doing here.
Well, I don't blame you.
Larry Tate should never have insisted on you coming to Japan, not with your wife about to have a baby.
Frankly, had I known, I would have suggested we conclude our business at a later date.
Now, would you like me to drive you to the airport?
I certainly would.
I'm sure my wife needs me desperately.
I'll get the keys.
Enough of two dum-dums, put them as before.
Let us have one Durwood, the big, crashing bore.
I asked for an incantation, not a review.
There you are, two for the price of one.
All right, Mr Stephens.
We're ready to He's gone.
As I said, he was acting strangely.
Perhaps he took a cab.
Sam?
What happened?
Why am I dressed like this?
What's going on?
Well, sweetheart, it's rather hard to explain.
I have the feeling this is the work of your mother, the wicked witch.
There.
There, you see, Mother?
He's back to normal.
That, my dear, is a matter of opinion.
Never mind her.
Okay, Sam.
Out with it.
Well, yesterday, when you couldn't decide whether to Wait a minute.
On second thought, I think I'll make a drink.
That's a good idea.
There isn't any ice.
I don't think I'll need any ice.
Well, yesterday when you couldn't make up your mind whether to go to Japan or Wait a minute.
What yesterday?
What happened to today?
Well, today is really tomorrow.
I don't know if I can explain this.
Try.
Well, you see, today is really today, but somewhere along the line, you lost a day.
Where did I lose it?
Well, it isn't exactly lost.
It's just that you don't remember.
I think I'll make it a double.
You see, you couldn't decide whether to quit your job or go to Tokyo, and the business side of you was having a struggle with the dear, devoted, considerate Samantha, get on with it.
Mother divided you and sent the business side to Tokyo.
I think I'll make it a triple.
The domestic Darrin went to Tokyo, and the business Darrin came here.
They sort of switched.
You mean I was popped back and forth from Tokyo to Oh, boy.
I think I'll make it a quadruple.
Okay.
I'll tell you the rest after you pass out.
Good idea.
All I know is I haven't enjoyed a dish of sukiyaki since then.
Darrin, you may not believe this, but Mother actually thought she was doing you a favour by splitting you in half.
Sure.
If your mother was really interested in my welfare, she'd migrate to another planet.
I have a feeling I shouldn't have raked over the coals.
They're obviously still burning.
- Are you all packed?
- Why?
Think we ought to go upstairs and unpack?
What are you talking about?
You don't seriously think that Larry is still gonna try to con me into going to Chicago.
You don't seriously think that he's gonna give up after one little try.
Larry is made of much sterner stuff.
Sam, I promise you here and now, no matter what trick Larry pulls, no matter how much he pleads or threatens, I am not going to postpone our vacation.
Want odds on who that is?
I'll get rid of him so fast it'll make his head spin.
My back.
My back.
Can't straighten up.
It's an old football injury.
Just on the way to the hospital.
Darrin, I hate to do this to you Larry, I've just got one thing to say to you Of course he'll go to Chicago for you.
- What?
- It's the least he can do for an old friend.
And, Larry, dear, don't you give a thought to our foolish little vacation.
You have to think about yourself.
Sam, you're a gem.
- Real gem.
- I don't believe my ears.
Darrin, look.
Here it comes again!
A bat!
A vampire bat!
Cover your head!
Okay.
It's gone.
You can uncover now, Larry, and stoop over again.
Just be sure you take good care of that portable bar I lent you.
Last one to finish packing is a rotten egg.
Darrin!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
All right.
Oh, Tabitha, come on.
Adam ate almost all of his lunch.
Now, you finish yours so we can go shopping for some shoes.
- Yoo-hoo!
Esmeralda?
- Hello, Samantha.
Is - Yes, but he'll be leaving in a minute.
- Oh, good.
- Hello, Tabitha.
- Hello, Esmeralda.
Esmeralda, would you mind babysitting while I take Tabitha to get some shoes?
And while Darrin goes to the driving range to hit some golf balls, or at least to swing at them.
Hello, Esmeralda.
How nice to see you for a change.
Darrin.
What I meant was it's always nice to see you.
Thank you, Mr Stephens.
- Samantha, have you seen my golf glove?
- Isn't it with your clubs?
- No, and it's not upstairs.
- Then it must be downstairs.
I'll help you look for it.
- Tabitha, please.
Finish your lunch.
- I'm not hungry.
Sweetheart, you've been saying that an awful lot lately.
I think it's psychological.
I think it's related to her feelings toward the new B-A-B-Y.
- That spells "baby".
- Smart, isn't she?
- Tabitha, will you please eat your lunch?
- No.
I don't want to.
Young lady, you'll finish everything on your plate or you'll go straight to your room.
Well, you gave her a choice.
Let's go look for your golf glove.
She's expressing her emotions of rivalry by refusing to eat.
I wish I could help her.
But I can.
I'll break through her appetite barrier by casting a spell on her milk.
As a trumpet sounds with a shimmering beat, she who drinks this will crave to eat.
Sweetheart?
Where is that book you were studying called How to Line up Your Fourth Putt?
That was called How to Improve Your Swing.
Sounds like the same thing to me.
- On the TV set.
Why?
- Just playing a hunch.
It looks like a rose you were saving from your first dance.
Thanks.
- See you later.
- Have fun.
- Esmeralda, where are you headed?
- Oh, I'm taking Tabitha her milk.
- Never mind.
- But her little stomach's empty.
And her little stubborn streak cannot go unpunished, so she will stay in her room.
For at least a good 10 minutes.
I'll put her milk in the refrigerator so it doesn't go to waste.
Oh, it won't go to waste.
Samantha, you drank Tabitha's milk.
- So?
It wasn't wasted.
- It wasn't intended for you.
Oh, that's all right.
It's all in the family.
Well, no sense in wasting a perfectly good lunch.
The spell that hit you by mistake, be now removed for both our sake.
Samantha?
Since you and Tabitha aren't ready to leave yet, could I run a fast errand?
Sure.
This is delicious.
Well As long as Adam didn't finish his strained carrots Mr Druggist, may I please have something that might Oh, not Mr Druggist.
Mr Apothecary, purveyor of prescriptions to some of the biggest names in the cosmos.
Oh, excuse me.
Mr Apothecary, I need something Say, how about some premium-grade nightingales' tongues?
They're going for a song.
That's an oldie but a goody.
- Will they cure a hunger spell?
- No, but they're great for warlock's foot.
I appreciate your peachy sense of humour, but I need something to cure a hunger spell, which I cast and now I can't remove.
Don't know as much as you think you know, huh?
That's the trouble with you teenagers.
Oh, I'm not a teenager.
I'm a young unmarried.
I was hoping maybe you could give me a potion.
No maybes about it.
I'll give you a potion so potent you'll pop your pink pyjamas.
Now you cut that out.
You got a date for the Metaphysical Meditatum and Barbecue?
No.
I've had dozens of offers.
- How soon can I get the potion?
- Well, just as soon as I've finished this.
It's a special formula of horn of unicorn, gizzard of lizard, tail of snail, caboose of moose and chicken fat.
- What does it cure?
- Don't cure nothing.
It's my lunch.
- Mrs Stephens, are you busy?
- Not at all, Mr Kravitz.
I was just getting ready to make myself a sandwich.
- You already have one.
- I know.
But somehow I think I'm gonna want another.
Come in.
- Boy, are you a fast eater.
- That was peanut butter and jelly.
- Would you like me to make one for you?
- No, thanks.
Mrs Stephens, my wife generously offered to circulate a petition, then went to visit her mother, so - Excuse me.
- It's a petition to Mrs Stephens, are you listening?
Oh, yes.
You're circulating a petition.
Right.
A petition relating to trash collection.
As a housewife, you're naturally aware that our local collection of trash takes place on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Go ahead.
I'm listening.
But this petition proposes that the days be changed to Mondays and Fridays.
- Please continue, Mr Kravitz.
- I lost my train of thought.
Do you mind if I come back sometime when you're less hungry?
You do mind?
You don't mind?
Oh, thank you.
Bon appetite.
- Anybody home?
- I'm in the kitchen!
Samantha, no joking about it.
You're a witch with an eating problem.
- Back from the shoe store?
- We didn't go.
No?
- Tabitha still pouting?
- Oh, no.
She's fine.
She's playing outside.
Then why didn't you take her shopping?
Because the shoe store doesn't sell hamburgers.
I guess I should ask what that means.
Sweetheart, I don't wanna alarm you, but there's something wrong with me.
I have a virus that creates an uncontrollable craving for food.
I never heard of a virus that makes people wanna eat.
I only heard of viruses that make people not wanna eat.
Well, you're talking about mortal people.
Darrin, I think I have voracious ravenousitis.
It's more common among warlocks, but witches get it, too.
- I got it.
- What can you do about it?
Well, I've tried to call Dr Bombay five times, but he didn't answer.
I forgot.
Saturday's his afternoon for his buffalo polo game.
- How could you forget that?
- It wasn't easy.
In the meantime, I just ate tonight's dinner.
So I'd better go to the market.
I'll take you.
If you're sick, you shouldn't drive.
- Who's gonna stay with the kids?
- Isn't Esmeralda here?
No.
No, she went on an errand.
But I'll get her.
- How soon will it be ready?
- That's tough to say.
I'm a slow worker.
Except with a groovy chick like you.
Yoo-hoo!
Esmeralda?
Whoever paged you pooped my potion.
Now I gotta start all over again.
Please hurry.
I need it as soon as possible.
- You called?
- Oh, yes.
Esmeralda, can you stay with the kids while Mr Stephens and I go to the market?
Yes.
- How do you feel?
- Hungry.
I should've told her and I will.
I definitely will.
I'll tell her.
Right after I cure her.
- Sam, control yourself.
- Yes, sweetheart.
I'll try.
Young woman, that's my apple.
Sorry.
I no longer desire it.
- Samantha, will you stop that?
- How?
- Hey, what's she doing?
- She's eating your lettuce.
Hey, man, what a far-out thing to be hooked on.
But, baby, if your bag is shoplifting, don't steal from me.
Steal from the store.
Madam, may I inquire what you're up to?
I'm eating cherry tomatoes.
Will you please repeat that?
- I'm eating cherry tomatoes.
- I see.
- My next question is, why?
- Because I'm hungry.
Madam, at the risk of branding myself a tool of capitalism, our purpose here is for you to buy merchandise and take it home.
If you eat it here, you consume our profits.
You're right.
I apologise.
Madam, may I inquire why you put this in my cart?
Darrin, don't get cute.
You know this is our cart.
This is my husband.
Where could I find a small rump roast suitable for a bachelor?
- In the meat department.
- Thank you.
Darrin!
You wanna put the groceries in the kitchen?
Oh, wait.
- Esmeralda, how is everything?
- Oh, fine.
Tabitha's up in her room, and Adam's taking a nap.
- Do you need me any more?
- Oh, no.
No, I'm gonna take Tabitha to get her shoes on Monday, and Oh, well, it's Saturday night.
I guess she had a date.
Why don't you try Dr Bombay again?
He should have his buffalo back in the stable by now.
Calling Dr Bombay!
Calling Dr Bombay!
Emergency!
Come right away!
Dr Bombay is unavailable.
His buffalo polo match went into triple overtime.
- How thrilling.
- May I help you?
- Who are you?
- I'm his new trained nurse.
Well, I'm Samantha Stephens, and I think I'm suffering from voracious ravenousitis.
- Do you know how to cure that?
- I've never even heard of it.
You have never heard of voracious ravenousitis?
I thought you were a trained nurse.
I am, but that's not what I'm trained in.
I'll give the doctor your message.
Should I take a wild guess at what she is trained in?
No.
Say, I just thought of something.
- What?
- Let's eat dinner.
I'm starved.
I thought you were in the baby's room, but you weren't.
No.
I'm here.
I'm just fixing myself a little sandwich.
- You call that little?
- Oh, be gentle with me, Darrin.
I've become a foodaholic.
Oh, come on, baby.
- How's about a little kiss?
- No.
Come on now.
It's Saturday night and we're young.
Oh, dear.
I'm in a hurry.
I want you to finish my potion.
Well, I'm waiting for an ingredient I had to order from Neptune.
Lately, deliveries from Neptune have been running late.
So just to keep us occupied let's fool around.
- You know what I mean?
- I don't want to.
Oh, don't fight it, baby.
You dig me and you know it.
Take five.
Sweetheart, would you make me a cup of coffee?
With saccharine.
Gotta watch those calories.
- Yes, Samantha.
What is it?
- Oh, Dr Bombay, I'm so glad you're here.
- Who won the polo match?
- Sam, who cares?
I do, and so does my buffalo.
Well, well, what's the problem?
I have to get back to an important conference.
I know.
We saw her.
Dr Bombay, I think I have voracious ravenousitis.
Really?
I haven't seen a good case of voracious ravenousitis in centuries.
Never mind seeing it.
Just cure it.
My good man, I have to see it before I can cure it.
Left elbow, please.
By your disease, you won't be bested.
Your symptoms are forthwith arrested.
- That's all?
- I don't believe in a lot of mumbo jumbo.
- How do you feel?
- Stuffed.
- Darrin, I'm cured.
- Doctor, you're okay.
If I ever become a warlock, I'll use you.
If you ever become a warlock, I'll become a mortal.
Well, sweetheart, let's go back to bed.
I have had a very full day.
Eat your breakfast, Tabitha.
- Do I have to?
- Yes.
Good morning, Darrin, Tabitha.
I'm sorry I Sam?
Sam?
- Good morning, Darrin, Tabitha.
I'm sorry I - You already said that.
I did?
What happened?
- You fell asleep.
- That's impossible.
She did it again.
- Are you all right?
- Sure.
I feel great.
Bright-eyed and Darrin, I think there may be something wrong with me.
- You know what I think I have?
- Voracious sleepitis?
No.
No.
I think I have a side effect from Dr Bombay's cure.
- You take Tabitha upstairs and I'll call him.
- All right.
Come on, honey.
Dr Bombay!
Paging Dr Bombay!
Emergency!
Come - Mrs Stephens?
- Oh, hi, Mr Kravitz.
Excuse me for bothering you, but when I circulate a petition, I wear my victims down until they sign it.
To refresh your memory from yesterday, this concerns trash collection.
- Oh, yes, Mr Kravitz?
- You fell asleep.
Oh, well, I'm terribly sorry, but things have been a little hectic around here.
Apology accepted.
It requests the city council to change the days of collection Mrs Stephens, I know all I'm talking about is garbage, but still and all, it's our community, and as citizens Boy, she must've had some night.
I never even knew she drank.
- Is it ready?
Is it ready?
- Oh, I've been working on it all night.
It's ready, willing and able, and so am I. - At last.
Let me have it.
- Only in exchange for a kiss.
Would you settle for a nice, warm handshake?
A kiss, a whole kiss and nothing but a kiss.
They just can't keep their lips off of me.
- Eureka!
- Where am I?
- Samantha, I have the answer.
- What was the question?
Yesterday, I put a spell on Tabitha's milk but you drank it.
I deserve your hatred.
I'm no good.
I'm a blundering fool who loves not wisely but too well.
Esmeralda, stop hamming it up.
You mean she didn't have voracious ravenousitis?
No, but this will cure her.
Well, thanks anyway, Esmeralda, but I'm afraid you're too late.
I don't get it.
Esmeralda, since Mrs Stephens is temporarily indisposed, would you be good enough to call for Dr Bombay?
Dr Bombay!
Paging Dr Bombay!
Emergency!
Come right away!
This better be pretty important to take me away from my tennis game.
- That's what you wear for tennis?
- It is when I'm tackling my new nurse.
Dr Bombay, what my wife thought was voracious ravenousitis wasn't.
Well, this is terrible.
The treatment I prescribed could produce side effects.
Yes, it did.
She keeps falling asleep.
Well, naturally, because my incantation called for all her symptoms to be arrested.
So near and yet so far.
Oh, Dr Bombay, now listen quick before I fall asleep.
Esmeralda has a potion that will remove her spell.
Now, if you can remove your cure, her cure can cure me.
- Is she right?
- I don't know, but it can't hurt to try.
- Left elbow?
- Right ankle.
Ignorant, isn't he?
The result of my treatment will all fade away.
Zip-a-dee-doo-dah, zip-a-dee-ay.
"My, oh, my, what a wonderful day".
Bit of a square, aren't you?
- Wow, am I hungry.
- Samantha, drink this in good health.
- Did it work?
- I think so.
Yes.
Good.
In that case, I can get back to my tennis match with my new nurse.
- What's the score?
- I don't know but my nurse does.
There.
You see?
Everyone got all excited over nothing.
Sam?
Sam!
Just a little joke, sweetheart.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Okay, now, we're gonna try another one, all right?
You're getting very smart.
Now, you have five apples, right?
You get one, two, three more apples.
- How many apples do you have?
- Eight apples.
That's very good.
Now think carefully.
You have eight apples.
Now take away two apples.
How many apples are left?
Take away two apples?
That's easy, Mommy.
That leaves six!
- You saw that?
- I saw that.
Well, how you like them apples?
- Sam, what's going on?
- New math?
- All right, Tabitha.
Bring back the apples.
- Yes, sweetheart, - those Winesaps cost 35 cents a pound.
- Okay.
Thanks, Tabitha.
Well, lesson's over, sweetheart.
Darrin, I really do think she's ready for kindergarten.
I think she's ready for The Ed Sullivan Show.
Good morning, dear child.
My precious Tabitha.
Hello, Grandmamma.
- Good morning, Durwood.
- It was, wasn't it?
Mother, Darrin and I are having an important discussion, - so if you don't mind - Of course I don't mind.
What is more important than Tabitha's education?
Fortunately, I have solved your problem.
May I present Professor Poindexter Phipps?
Forget it, Endora.
Tabitha is not having a warlock for a teacher.
Why not?
She has a witch for a mother.
Professor, this is my daughter, Samantha.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- And you must be Durwood.
- Try Darrin.
Apple for the teacher.
Good form for a mortal.
- Sam, I want to talk to you.
- When?
- Now.
- Excuse us.
- Yes, sweetheart?
- I just heard it.
Sweetheart, Mother was just trying to be helpful.
And you will admit it's time Tabitha was getting a formal education, won't you?
- Now, Sam - Who could be more qualified to teach a young witch thirsting for knowledge than a warlock?
Well, I guess it can't hurt to try.
But only if you promise the professor will teach Tabitha in a perfectly normal, perfectly mortal way.
I promise.
Witch's honour.
I mean, right.
I should have warned you, Professor Phipps, Durwood is a little eccentric.
It's no matter.
I'll be happy to comply.
Mr Stephens, let me put it this way.
It's true I am a warlock, but first, I am an educator.
I do not teach witchcraft.
I teach the arts.
Music, literature, et cetera.
- In the mortal way.
- As you wish.
- Tabitha?
- Goodbye, dear.
Is this a sample of your work?
Yes, it's a campaign I dreamed up.
Your daughter's acquiring a tutor none too soon.
It isn't meant to be literature, Professor.
It's one of Darrin's advertising campaigns.
And, I might add, a highly successful advertising campaign.
You see, normal people like to identify with a familiar phrase, like "don't cry over spilt milk".
Why don't you call those phrases what they really are, clichés?
Mortal, verbal mediocrity.
If you'll excuse me, I'll get on with Tabitha's lessons.
Come, my dear.
Mother, the art of using familiar phrases to catch the public eye is a very important part of the advertising business.
Forget it, Sam.
I'm late for the office.
Endora, I'm sorry I can't stay and chat, but if you're able to drop in tomorrow morning I certainly hope not.
Samantha, is it really true that if Durwood could think up more of those so-called phrases, he would be more successful doing whatever it is he does?
Of course.
Advertising men get paid a lot of money - to come up with clever slogans.
- Really?
Now, Mother - Excuse me, Herb.
- Have a nice day, Mr Stephens.
Spirits north and spirits south, let my spell control your mouth.
Let Durwood find, to his dismay, that all his words are now cliché.
Thanks, Ted.
But nothing comes easy.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating.
The trick is to walk softly and carry a big stick.
- Yeah, that's what they say.
- They sure do say that, don't they?
"There in the back streets of London, "Oliver met the Artful Dodger, "the young ringleader of a gang of boy thieves".
What did Artful look like?
Well, he was about this tall and skinny, with a smudge on his nose, and he wore a tall silk hat.
- Was he handsome?
- I've got it.
Why don't I show you?
Tabitha, I would like you to meet the Artful Dodger.
Charmed, my dear.
Come on.
You can smile a little bit.
- He looks just like Darrin, doesn't he?
- Nonsense.
Babies always have that bewildered expression.
Mother!
I'm gonna go down and sneak a peek at Tabitha's lesson.
- You want to come?
- In a moment, love.
I want to stay and play with my grandson.
Come on, now.
Come on.
Look at Grandmamma.
Come on.
That's a boy.
That's a little fellow.
Professor, who in the world is this?
The Artful Dodger.
At your service, fair lady.
- My ring, please.
- Ring?
What ring?
The one you just removed from my finger.
So I did.
It must be this hangnail.
Catches everything.
Isn't he wonderful, Samantha?
A page out of Dickens come to life.
Professor, you promised us there wouldn't be any witchcraft.
I promised I wouldn't teach witchcraft, and I haven't.
Well, I don't think that Darrin would see it that way, so why don't we just return him to the pages of literature?
I will return my teaching aid from whence he came when I decide the lesson is over.
Is that clear?
- Now just a moment, Professor - Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Darrin, these sales figures for Kitty Kakes are fantastic, thanks to your slogan.
Yeah, the public bought it hook, line and sinker.
I'll say, you son of a gun, and Multiple Industries couldn't be happier.
Tickled pink, huh?
The colour's more like green, Mr Phrasemaker.
And some of that green will be a bonus for you.
A bonus?
That would be a sight for sore eyes.
Right.
Anyway, H.B. Summers, Multiple's head of marketing, wants you to create a new slogan for their farm machinery division.
- How do you like that?
- I don't.
You know, the acoustics are lousy in this room.
I could have sworn I already have a campaign worked out for the farm machinery division.
What's good for the goose doesn't necessarily mean it's good for the gander.
Darrin, this gander wants slogans, and if we don't come up with some, our goose is cooked.
We should put this in the think tank for a while.
Darrin, what's the matter with you?
You sound like an encyclopaedia of clichés.
- Well, you can't judge a book by its cover.
- There you go again.
You're right.
Clichés are like popcorn.
Once you get started, you can't stop.
Pull yourself together, Darrin.
Multiple Industries makes everything from safety pins to bulldozers, and all we need is a few good slogans, and we're in.
Now here's a list of all their products.
Can you come up with something by noon?
Well, Larry, I don't like to blow my own horn - That's perfect.
- For what?
Their musical instruments division.
- Where are you going?
- Home sweet home.
You know, when the cat's away, the mice will play.
What I meant was, I left something at home.
- I'd forget my head if it wasn't fastened on.
- All right, but be quick about it.
We have a lunch date with Summers at the Blue Boar at 1:00.
Larry, I'll be there to grab the bull by its horns before any more water passes under the bridge.
Sam.
- Hi, sweetheart.
What's the matter?
- What's the matter?
I'll try to keep a civil tongue in my head, and at the same time, talk turkey.
- I smell a rat.
- Darrin, why are you talking so funny?
Because someone put a spell on me, and I'll bet dollars to doughnuts I know who did it.
- Mother!
- Yes, my love?
- Did you put a spell on Darrin?
- I cannot tell a lie.
I did place a friendly little spell on Durwood.
That's the last straw.
Would you tell her to button her lip?
Mother, you've had your little joke, so if you would Would it be presumptuous of me to request a little silence during school hours?
Well, I'm terribly sorry, Professor.
We'll try to keep it quieter.
Mother, if you don't remove that spell, I I say, a handsome gentleman.
- Me hand, sir.
- Sam, who is this?
One thing at a time, sweetheart.
The spell, remember?
- Come along.
Mother.
- Very well.
I'll take the spell off.
You try to do a good turn for someone - Sweetheart, say something.
- I'll say something.
Who was that English kid in there, and And where's my watch?
I think your second question answered your first question.
That's the Artful Dodger from Oliver Twist.
That settles it.
I said no witchcraft, and he used witchcraft.
- Sam, the professor goes.
- Just a minute, Durwood.
Endora, you've been a busy little bee.
Now buzz off.
Really.
Well, I certainly hope Mother's going to be a good sport about this.
Here's your watch, sweetheart.
The Dodger has this problem with a hangnail.
I'll bet.
Now, Sam, I've got to leave now or I'll be late for my lunch meeting.
But I want it clearly understood that when I return, the professor and that kleptomaniac will be out of here.
It's as good as done, sweetheart.
There goes my little pigeon.
The spell I renew, you boorish lout.
Your clichés will be few, but you'll act them out.
- Goodbye.
Thank you.
- Yes.
Goodbye.
Has Mr Tate arrived yet?
Yes.
He and another gentlemen have been here for a few minutes.
- I'll take you to their table.
- It's 1:15 already.
Time sure flies.
- How did you do that?
- Sorry.
Family secret.
Would you tell Mr Tate that Mr Stephens called - and said he couldn't make it?
- Darrin!
Come on, Summers is anxious to meet you.
H.B. Summers, meet Darrin Stephens, better known as the slogan king.
My pleasure, Stephens.
I'm a great admirer of yours.
- Thanks, Mr Summers.
- H.B. To my friends.
Stephens, you're my kind of ad man.
Your campaigns are clever.
- They hit that nail right on the head.
- Right, H.B. Darrin has the genius to get through to the common man.
Tate was telling me about your latest slogan.
"Blow your own horn".
I like that, Stephens.
It's knockout.
Thanks, H.B. I wish I could see eye to eye with you.
- Darrin, you all right?
- Sure, sure.
I was just attempting to point out that slogans can be overdone.
Now, I have a campaign worked out for your farm machinery division Forget it.
I got a little idea myself for the bulldozer division.
Now what do you think of this?
"Make molehills out of mountains".
You get it?
There's a twist there.
Of course we get it, H.B., and it's knockout.
- Right, Darrin?
- Truthfully, no.
It just doesn't ring the bell.
What was that?
Two bells and all's well.
It's an old custom here.
- That reminds me, I've got to call home.
- You have to do it now?
Yes.
Larry, just order me a club sandwich.
I'll be back quicker than you can say Jack Robinson.
- Jack Robinson.
- Jack Robinson.
That's very good.
- Why did we say that?
- I don't know.
Maybe it's catching.
Well, I warned you.
Mother's very sensitive about being told to buzz off.
There aren't as many clichés now, but when I do say one, it comes true.
Well, just calm down, sweetheart.
I'll find Mother.
You're right, Sam.
I've got to get a grip on myself.
Darrin?
Darrin?
- Hello.
- What happened?
I'll tell you later.
Just track down your mother, fast.
Goodbye, Sam.
Darrin, you can't insult a man's brainchild and then just walk away.
- What's bothering you?
- I couldn't begin to tell you.
- Well, get a grip on yourself.
- I already tried that.
Sorry for the interruption.
Now, back to the problem of slogans.
I devote a lot of my time keeping in touch with the public.
You might say keeping my ear to the ground.
Another one of those clever demonstrations, H.B. Would you like to get up now, Darrin?
Gentlemen, I really don't feel very well.
I think I'd better go home.
- Was it something I said, Stephens?
- Not at all, H.B.
But I'd better shake a leg.
So, if you'll excuse me, I'll just bow out.
How come all the creative ones have a screw loose upstairs?
H.B., as of this moment, Stephens is off your account.
Why?
He may be a ding-a-ling, but he's got a magic touch.
Exactly, and he'll be with you as long as you want him.
- Sam.
Sam.
Where are you?
- I'm in the nursery.
I'll be right down.
Have you reached your mother yet?
I don't know whether I'm coming or going.
- Darrin?
I thought I heard you come in.
- You did, but your mother's spell is at work.
- It's Larry.
- We're not home.
You want the slogan king, you'll get the slogan king.
If I have to bring him in in a net.
Darrin?
Darrin?
Darrin!
- Tate, what are you doing?
- Darrin and I have an understanding.
If he doesn't answer the doorbell, I'm supposed to crawl in the window.
There you are, Darrin!
Come on in, H.B. Hi, Larry.
I was just going to open the door.
Yeah, quicker than I can say Jack Robinson, huh?
- Sam, Mr Summers.
- How do you do?
Thank goodness you're here.
Maybe you can talk some sense into your husband.
I'm sorry, Larry, but I won't have anything to do with a campaign based on slogans.
Come on, Stephens.
We're grown men.
Why can't we reach a compromise?
All right, H.B. If you'll play ball with me, I'll play ball with you.
Mother!
Mother, you come here this instant!
Mother, you materialise and fast!
That isn't a very affectionate way to summon one's mother.
After what you have done to Darrin, what do you expect, the witch's love call?
Well, to coin a mortal phrase, it looks like they bored each other stiff.
Very amusing.
Now, undo your thing.
If you insist.
Now I'm off to Oxford.
I've entered a new class that should help me to understand Durwood a little better.
Marvellous, Mother.
It's a course in anthropoid behaviour.
Ta-ta.
Really.
- Sam, what happened?
- Never mind what happened.
Let's just worry about what's going to happen.
Yeah.
How am I gonna explain those baseball uniforms?
You won't have to.
You just take their coats off while I make a couple of drinks.
- Sam, would you mind telling me what - We have a lot to do.
I'll tell you as we go along.
- You're sure he won't break?
- Of course not.
We'll just get them comfortable on the sofa.
Then I'll bring them to, and we'll be chatting as if everything were normal.
What are we chatting about?
About how nice it is that they dropped in, and And how pleased I am that H.B. Finally agreed to go for my campaign instead of the slogans.
Very good.
Honey, hand me a drink.
And you put one in his hand.
Goodness.
Me, too.
Okay.
You ready?
Mr Summers, you have such a delightful sense of humour.
So, you really feel, H.B., that my idea is knockout?
I don't understand this.
The last thing I remember, I was standing over there, wearing a baseball uniform.
Baseball uniform?
You are joking, Mr Summers.
Listen, didn't we crawl in through the window and Crawl in the window?
Come on, Larry, what are you trying to do, gaslight me?
Just another little joke.
But now back to our discussion about my idea for the farm machinery.
Personally, I love Darrin's idea.
Not that I count, of course.
It's the fact that you like it so much, Mr Summers, that matters.
How about you, Larry?
You're the only one we haven't heard from.
Well, if H.B. Likes it, I like it, too.
I mean, you do like it, don't you?
It's knockout.
Isn't it?
- Certainly.
- Certainly.
Well, I have a severe headache and I think I'd better run along - to the office and take a little nap.
- Dear.
What a shame.
Well, Larry, why don't you stay here, and we can go over the idea in detail so that we Never mind.
Just write it down on a piece of paper, put it on my desk, and we'll discuss it.
You didn't see any baseball uniforms, did you, Larry?
No, not me.
Just for the record, I didn't see any baseball uniforms either, in case it ever comes up.
Well, let's go, Tate.
Mrs Stephens, thank you for your hospitality.
Lessons are over.
We'll be leaving for the day.
Well, Larry, Mr Summers, this is Professor Phipps and Master Dodger, Tabitha's tutors.
Yes.
You see, we're the tutors, and she's the tutee.
- Cute little dickens, isn't he?
- Well, good day.
Professor, don't you want to leave by the front door?
Well, that's a quaint notion.
Let's try it, Dodger.
It's a pleasure meeting you fine gentlemen.
- Take care, now.
- Yeah.
- Bye, Sam.
- Bye, H.B. - Thank you.
- Mr Summers.
Sure.
Well I seem to have lost my cuff links.
- Call me if you find them.
- Sure, H.B. Well, Sam, it looks like H.B.'s cuff links have found a place in literature.
Well, that'll be a new twist.
Sorry, sweetheart.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Yoo-hoo!
Mother, I'm sorry I'm late, but the stores were jammed - Bonjour, Samantha.
- Mother!
I have had a tough day shopping.
Darrin is coming home early from work, and I'd like to get dinner started.
So, if you don't mind, I would like to have my old furniture back.
If you expect me to baby-sit, it's going to have to be in the grand style to which I am accustomed.
As far as Darrin and I are concerned, our old furniture is grand enough.
Oh, Samantha.
The Salvation Army wouldn't even send a truck out for it.
Where is your breeding, your culture, your upbringing, darling?
I still have those, Mother, only my furniture is gone, but not for long.
Oh, Samantha.
I don't understand you.
You could be living in the lap of luxury instead of on the bony knees of poverty.
I happen to like bony knees.
Oh, Samantha, I'm still a guest in your home, and happy surroundings make a happy guest.
Mother, your baby-sitting chores are over, and so is your horsing around with my living room.
Mrs Mother, you know Darrin's mother.
Mrs Stephens.
Mrs Stephens.
Mother, would you please get some water?
Why?
She looks so peaceful.
It's a pity to disturb her.
Mother.
She's not sleeping.
She fainted.
There's a big difference.
Here.
If you insist on bringing her around.
Oh, Samantha.
Here, have some water, Mrs Stephens.
My pills, my tranquiliser pills, they're in my purse.
Mother, would you please get Mrs Stephens' purse?
- Of course.
- I think the walk might do you good.
What a concerned daughter you are.
Always looking after my health.
The furniture, it's normal.
But it was all different.
And now it's back?
The furniture's back and all's right with the world.
Here, have a tranquiliser.
You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?
How could you?
I'm obviously losing my mind.
Oh, Mrs Stephens, that's crazy.
I mean, that's ridiculous.
You are one of the most solid, realistic, well-adjusted people I know.
Here, have a tranquiliser.
Samantha, I know you're trying to soothe me, but let's face it, there's nothing you can say, dear.
When the mind starts to go, what can anyone say?
What about bon voyage?
Mother!
Mrs Stephens, why don't you go upstairs and lie down?
- It might make you feel a little better.
- Oh, perhaps you're right.
I'd be less of a nuisance.
- Let me help you.
- No.
No, thank you, dear.
You've You've already done enough.
Yeah, more than enough.
Honey!
Honey.
- Have I got great news.
- Not so loud.
Samantha, I just landed an account I've been trying to get for six months.
Six months of badgering Larry to try a new angle, and you know how I did it?
- I just - Darrin, your mother's here.
- How wonderful.
I can tell you both.
- She's lying down.
You mean she's resting.
"Recuperating" might be a better word.
Recuperating from what?
Well, actually, it's not as bad as you might expect.
Let me be the judge of that.
- I think you'd better sit down.
- I think so, too.
Darrin, your mother is perfectly fine.
It's just that she thinks she's losing her mind.
Out with it, Sam.
What happened?
Well, when I came back from shopping, Mother had changed the furniture.
- You mean she moved it around.
- Not around, out, and exchanged it with Louis XIV furniture.
My mother came in and caught the Bobbsey twins at play.
- Now she thinks she's losing her mind.
- That's about it.
Terrific.
Darrin, to say I am sorry is a masterpiece of understatement.
Not only that, it doesn't solve anything.
Well, there's only one solution.
- What's that?
- We'll have to tell your mother the truth.
Samantha, my mother isn't losing her mind, you are.
- We have no other choice.
- Yes, we do.
But I don't know which one is better.
To let my mother go on thinking she's losing her mind or to tell her that her son is married to a witch.
Oh, well, she'll take it all right.
You told me yourself you had an aunt who thought she was a lighthouse.
- But, Sam, that isn't the same thing.
- Well, you bet it isn't.
When it's foggy, I don't stand up on the roof and do this to warn the ships at sea.
Yeah, she was kind of weird.
- Let's look at the bright side.
- You find it and I'll be glad to look at it.
Well, first, and most important, is the relief of not having to pretend any more.
After six years, the truth can be told.
Tell me more about the bright side.
Darrin, what else can we do?
As the wise man said, "Honesty is the best policy".
I'll bet that wise man didn't have to tell his mother his wife is a witch.
Frank!
Is that you?
- Oh, it's you, Darrin.
- Hi, Mom.
How do you feel?
I heard voices and I thought it was your father.
I guess I can't even recognise my own husband's voice any more.
I suppose Samantha told you what happened.
Yes, she told me, all right.
Well, don't worry about me, Son.
I'll disappear quietly into oblivion, and your father will be all right.
He's young.
He can remarry, even start a new family.
Wouldn't you like a baby brother?
Mom, you're talking nonsense.
Of course I'm talking nonsense.
My mind is gone.
Well, Mother, you're about to hear something that's going to relieve you - and shock you.
- Go ahead.
Shock treatment may be just what I need right now.
It's all yours, Sam.
Well, Mrs Stephens, the furniture that you saw changing back and forth, it actually did change.
Oh, Samantha, please, we've been all through that.
No, no.
No, we haven't been through what I'm going to tell you.
It's a secret we should have told you a long time ago.
- A secret?
- Yes.
It explains how you happened to see the furniture change.
Yes.
I am a witch.
You're a what?
I'm a witch.
So is my mother.
Oh, Samantha!
That's ridiculous.
I'm not so sure about your mother.
No, you see, I really am a witch.
A cauldron-stirring, card-carrying witch.
And I have magic powers, and I can make things move around.
Samantha, there's no such thing as witches.
Well, I guess I'll just have to prove it.
Darrin, would you like that ashtray?
Please.
It's magic.
It's all done with mirrors.
It must be.
Well, how about this, Mrs Stephens?
Oh, that's awful!
I gave you that for your last wedding anniversary.
Don't worry.
I'll put it back together.
Samantha, you're a witch.
Now you're talking.
And the furniture really did change, and you really did make that ashtray fly through the room?
She did that, too.
Oh, that must be Frank.
Now, Mom, it's not necessary to tell Dad about all this right now.
We'll find the right moment, and then we'll spring it on him.
In the meantime, it'll be our little secret, okay?
Okay.
Hi, Dad.
Darrin, I got the strangest call from your mother.
She seems to think she's - Frank!
- Phyllis.
- I'm so glad to see you.
- Are you all right?
Oh, it's true, Frank.
I thought I was losing my mind but I'm not.
- Oh, of course you're not.
- I realised I was perfectly sane once I found out Samantha is a witch.
- Samantha's a what?
- A witch.
She's a witch.
Now, look, Phyllis, you made me miss my pinochle game, and I got a ticket racing over here.
I'm in no mood for jokes.
Samantha, go ahead, prove you're a witch.
Phyllis, you're talking about our daughter-in-law.
Watch this.
Hey!
That's the present we got them for their last anniversary.
I know.
You'll see, Frank.
Having a witch in the family will be fun.
If I break a vase, I'll just call Samantha and she puts it back together again.
Go ahead, Sam.
One more time.
Phyllis, when you called me, you told me you were losing your mind.
- You were right.
- I'm telling you, Frank.
I saw the vase fall and break and And she put it back together again.
And she made an ashtray fly across the room.
Come along.
Let's go see Dr Rhinehouse.
My coat.
A witch.
- Sam, what happened?
- I don't know.
Somebody's pulled the plug on my powers.
How do you feel?
Well, I feel fine.
I just don't understand what happened.
I just heard, Samantha.
It was the Witches' Council that removed your powers.
- How dare they!
- How dare you!
Revealing yourself to mortals could be disastrous.
How soon you forget the beating we took at Salem.
But the Witches' Council doesn't have any right to take away my powers.
They have the right to prevent you from frivolously flaunting yourself as a witch.
- Now you still have your powers.
- Wait a minute.
But not in front of mortals.
Durwood doesn't count.
How am I gonna convince Mrs Stephens that she hasn't flipped?
Well, you can't show yourself as a witch, so you'll have to come up with another idea.
But there is no other way.
As usual, Durwood, you're a bottomless pit of ideas.
Now, tell me, Mrs Stephens, what seems to be the trouble?
Dr Rhinehouse, I'm losing my mind.
And what else is bothering you?
Doctor, I don't think you heard me.
I said I'm losing my mind.
My dear Mrs Stephens, we're all losing our mind, more or less.
The world is a very anxious, uptight place.
But, Doctor, I saw an ashtray fly across the room, a vase shatter and put itself back together again.
At least you haven't been bored.
Bored?
I'm mad!
Now, now let's not jump to conclusions.
An active imagination doesn't mean you're mad.
- Have you tried writing?
- Dr Rhinehouse, if you want to know the truth, I still think my daughter-in-law's a witch.
So, I think my son-in-law's a bum.
He hasn't worked in eight months.
But, Doctor, my daughter-in-law's a real witch.
I mean, she does all kinds of witch tricks.
You mean she flies on a broom?
I don't know.
- She might if she was in a hurry.
- Charming!
You don't believe me.
You think I'm making it up.
I tell you, I'm sick!
Please, I'm the doctor.
If you're sick, I tell you.
Sorry.
So, stay on your tranquilisers, and don't worry about a thing.
And take my advice, write.
It's a shame to waste an imagination like yours.
Then you think there's nothing seriously wrong with me, Doctor?
Of course not, you're fine.
Mr Stephens, may I see you for a moment, please, alone?
Mr Stephens, there's something seriously wrong with your wife.
But only a second ago you said she was fine.
Forget what I said a second ago.
Believe me, she's sick.
Well, what's wrong with her?
- You want the truth?
- Yes.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
At $35 an hour you don't know?
Let me put it another way, I'm not sure.
It could be physical or it could be mental.
Oh, well, I'm glad you narrowed it down to that.
I suggest a complete physical examination, and I will set up a series of psychological tests for her to take.
Well, isn't there something we can do in the meantime?
Yeah, love her, comfort her und never let her out of your sight.
Phyllis.
Phyllis!
"Dear Frank, I know Dr Rhinehouse wasn't telling me the truth.
"Please try to forget me.
Love, Phyllis".
I just don't understand it.
Your mother's been complaining of aches and pains for years, but she's never gone off the track before.
- I have a hunch where she might have gone.
- Where's that?
Well, the logical place for a person to go who thinks she's Well I think she'd go to a rest home.
That's a possibility.
There must be hundreds of rest homes in the city.
We'll call them all.
I'll bet she's in one of them right now, taking her pills.
Yeah, her pills.
Excuse me while I check my roast.
- I'll get the phone book, Dad.
- Good.
Here, try the Whippoorwill Rest Home.
That's her favourite bird.
Elixir of herbs and sloe gin fizz, whisk me to where Mrs Stephens is.
Oh, that's terrible.
I'm Mrs Quigley.
What's your name, sweetie?
Mrs Stephens.
What are you in for?
I'm having hallucinations.
I think my daughter-in-law's a witch.
My kids put me away.
Unappreciative, rotten little - Well, what are you in for?
- I told you.
I have delusions that my daughter-in-law's a witch.
- You play gin?
- No.
No, I never learned.
Well, you should have.
People ought to plan for their old age.
What are you in for?
- I've been trying to tell you.
My - I know!
- I'll bet you play canasta.
- No, I don't.
That's the trouble with you youngsters.
You're unaccomplished.
You never did tell me what - What's in that bottle?
- Those are my tranquilisers.
Oh, let me have one.
Mine aren't working at all.
- Oh, do you really think you should?
- Boy, you are a worrier.
I don't blame your kids for putting you away.
They didn't put me away.
I put myself away.
People and things be wild and free, but only for Mrs Quigley to see.
Look at that!
Look at what?
Those oranges, they all floated off the tree, and then bounced around on the ground, and then floated back onto the tree again.
It was wild.
Look at that!
Look at what?
Those pills.
What's in those pills?
I'm on a trip you wouldn't believe.
Doctor!
Doctor!
Doctor!
Oh, Mrs Stephens, thank goodness I found you!
Samantha, what are you doing here?
Looking for you.
Mr Stephens and Darrin are worried sick.
- Do you play canasta?
- I'm afraid not.
Oh, that's the trouble with teenagers.
You're worse than the youngsters.
What's the matter, Mrs Quigley?
Give me those pills, sweetie.
Take a look at these tranquilisers, Doctor.
These aren't tranquilisers.
They're hallucinogenics.
- They are?
- Yes.
You take one of these and you can imagine all sorts of wild things.
I'll take a gross.
Samantha, those are my pills.
There seems to be some sort of a mistake here.
The bottle is marked "tranquilisers," but these are hallucinogenic pills.
Well, that explains everything.
The druggist must have given you the wrong pills.
You've got a lawsuit here, Mrs Stephens.
Oh, Doctor, I'm too relieved for that.
I've been seeing crazy things all day and now I know why.
Oh, Samantha, dear, forgive me.
I don't know what to say.
Don't say anything, Mrs Stephens.
I understand.
Just thank Mrs Quigley.
If it hadn't been for her, we might never have found out.
- Mrs Quigley.
- Oh, you wanna hand wrestle.
Well, that's one thing I don't do, but I will take those pills, sweetie.
With your permission, ladies, I'll take those pills.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Mommy.
- How's your chin?
- It's better.
- That's good.
Maybe the next time I tell you you're too young to fly, you'll pay attention to me.
Mommy, can we go to the play park this afternoon?
Not today, sweetheart.
I have a lot to do.
But I want to go to the play park.
So do I, sweetheart.
But I told you, I have too much to do.
I have to finish feeding Adam, then I have to give him his bath, put him down for his nap, and then there are diapers to fold.
Why can't Esmeralda do all that?
Because Esmeralda isn't here, and because Mommy should do those things.
Sweetheart, I just finished the revisions on the Nickerson account, and I've got a meeting with them at 2:00, so I better run.
See you at dinner, big fella.
May I have a ice-cream cone?
Certainly, as soon as I'm through feeding Adam.
That does it, young lady.
You know you're not supposed to do things like that.
But you said I could have a ice-cream cone.
And mommy also said she'd get it for you right after Adam finished his lunch.
That's not fair.
Sweetheart, don't you understand, you have to share mommy now that you have a little brother?
May I go to my room now?
I thought you wanted an ice-cream cone.
I don't want it any more.
Then you can go to your room and stay there.
Women start to get difficult early in life, don't they?
Well, really?
She'll be all right.
I'll look in on her later.
I better run.
Say hello to Mr Nickerson for me and good luck.
Thanks, honey.
Oh, well.
Well, you want a bite, too?
You want a bite?
It's cold.
I wish, I wish, I wish I had my very own special mommy that I don't have to share with anyone.
Hi, Tabitha.
Are you my very own special mommy that I don't have to share with anyone?
I'm the mommy you wished for.
Come on, let's play a game or something.
Don't you have to take care of the baby?
What baby?
Oh, you are the most beautiful child.
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Here I come, ready or not.
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
You're such a good hider.
Where are you, my little blonde angel?
Such beauty and such brains Home free.
Home free.
You didn't catch me.
You didn't catch me.
You're so clever, precious.
Now it's my turn.
Cover your eyes.
Okay.
Only remember, if Mommy comes in I mean, my other Mommy, don't let her see you.
I won't.
Now close your eyes and count to 10.
Okay.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Here I come, ready or not.
You're not hiding.
Tabitha, what are you doing?
Just playing a game, Mommy.
Well, play a little bit more quietly, will you?
- I just put the baby down for his nap.
- Okay.
Now I have to finish the laundry.
See you later.
We have to be quiet.
The baby's taking a nap.
All right, precious.
Why don't we go to the play park?
Goody!
What a marvellous idea.
I have some tickets left over from last time.
You are clever.
All right.
Here we go to the play park.
Well, let's see.
What would taste good after two hot dogs, popcorn, candy apples, two boxes of peppermints and cotton candy?
I don't know whether I want a snow cone or a chocolate drumstick.
Well, that's easy.
Have one of each.
You're the best mommy anyone ever had.
I want two snow cones and two chocolate drumsticks, please.
Mrs Stephens!
Mrs Stephens!
Tabitha!
- Hi, Mrs Kravitz.
- Hi, Mrs Stephens.
Hi, Tabitha.
- You remember my nephew, Seymour?
- Hi.
Mommy's gonna take me for a ride on the train.
Come on, Mommy.
Mrs Stephens.
Do you realise you haven't even said hello to me?
Oh.
Hello.
Is something wrong?
- Where's the baby?
- What baby?
There's the train, Mommy.
Come on.
Mrs Stephens.
Do you realise that you didn't even say goodbye to me?
Goodbye.
Good job, Darrin.
Good job.
But you know, I wouldn't be surprised if we have Samantha to thank when we finally get Nickerson back on the old dotted line.
What's Sam got to do with it?
Well, last night's dinner was a culinary masterpiece.
And to quote Nickerson, Samantha was the most charming hostess he's ever met.
That's very nice.
I couldn't agree with him more.
I'll tell her just as soon Never mind.
I'll tell her myself when I see her tonight.
Tonight?
Yeah.
Nickerson and his wife want a return engagement.
Can you blame them?
Larry, I think my campaign ideas are enough reason to get Nickerson to renew.
I said you did a good job, Darrin, not a great job.
It's just one night.
They'll be going back to Chicago tomorrow.
And after another wonderful evening with Samantha, we'll have Nickerson eating out of our hands.
I don't mind him eating out of our hands.
I just don't want him eating off our plates.
Darrin, if you won't do it for Nickerson, do it for me, the one person at McMann & Tate who does the hiring and firing.
Okay, okay.
I'll check with Samantha, - and if she's not too tired - I knew I could count on you.
- Yes?
- There's a Mrs Kravitz calling for Mr Stephens.
- Who?
- A neighbour.
I'll take it in my office.
See you tonight.
Hello?
Hi, Darrin.
How's it going?
Nothing much.
Just a few chores around the house.
Tabitha?
She's still playing in her room.
I haven't Look, Sam, you may as well level with me.
Mrs Kravitz called me and told me she'd seen you and Tabitha at the park, and I think it's wrong for you to give in to her so soon.
Darrin, that's ridiculous.
Why would Mrs Kravitz call and tell you such a thing?
What do you mean, "What baby"?
Just a minute, Darrin.
Tabitha?
Tabitha?
Oh, good grief.
Darrin, Tabitha isn't in her room.
I just looked.
I think I better pop over to the park and see what's going on.
Never mind the popping.
Mrs Kravitz said she saw Tabitha at the park with you.
Not me.
Would you believe Serena?
Why don't you pop over to the park and see what's going on?
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll call you as soon as I find out what Serena's up to.
Bye-bye.
Esmeralda?
Esmeralda, I need you.
- Aunt Hagatha.
Where's Esmeralda?
- I'm covering for her.
She went south for the Galactic Rejuvenation and Dinner Dance.
Well, just keep an eye on Adam for me, will you?
I'll be back as quickly as I can.
What goes up must come down, right?
I think I want to go home now, Mommy.
Excuse me.
Well, that was fast.
Now if you don't mind, I want to get back to my metaphysical meditation.
Mrs Stephens, you're home.
I just thought I'd look in to make sure the baby was all right.
What baby?
Mrs Stephens, are you sure you're all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
Mommy and I are going up to my room and play.
Come on, Mommy.
Would you mind if I looked in on the baby to see if he was all right?
Do whatever you want.
Tabitha and I are going up to her room to play.
You don't understand.
I'm looking for my little girl.
You're right, lady.
I don't understand.
She was probably with someone who looks a great deal like me.
There was a slight resemblance.
Then you did see her.
Where did she go?
Back where she came from.
I don't think you're being very cooperative.
Lady, look.
If you'd like to get on the wheel and go up and look for her, I'll let you ride up for nothing.
But I'm not hanging around to see who comes back down.
Now wait a minute.
You mean my little girl rode up on the Ferris wheel but she didn't come back down?
You said it, lady.
I didn't.
Well, thank you.
Excuse me.
I'm in a terrible hurry.
But, Mr Stephens, I think you better get home as quickly as you can.
Yes, Tabitha's fine, and there's nothing wrong with the baby.
But Mrs Stephens is behaving very strangely.
She doesn't even know who I am.
Mrs Kravitz.
What are you doing here?
I think you better hurry before it's too late.
Too late?
Mrs Kravitz, is something wrong?
Where's Aunt Hagatha?
Mrs Stephens, calm yourself.
The baby's fine, and Tabitha's up in her room playing.
Remember?
Oh, yes.
Of course.
Well, Mrs Kravitz, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll go up and have a little talk with her.
If you don't mind my saying so, Mrs Stephens, I think you ought to go and lie down and have a nice long rest.
What for?
There's nothing wrong with me.
That's what they all say.
But I want to have real food for our tea party and real tea to drink.
All right, sweetheart.
I'll pop down to the kitchen and fix us lots of goodies, then we can have a real party.
Tabitha, where have you been?
Oh, hello, Mommy.
Don't "oh, hello, Mommy" me, young lady.
What have you been up to, and where's Auntie Serena?
Auntie Serena isn't here, Mommy.
She took you to the park, didn't she?
- Tabitha.
- She didn't, Mommy.
Honest.
Sam?
Hello.
Would you mind telling me what's going on around here?
Mrs Kravitz bugging me at the office is not something that I look forward to.
Nothing's going on around here, except Tabitha's waiting for her goodies.
And what was Tabitha doing at the park?
We had fun at the park.
But I thought you said she was with Serena.
Serena?
- Sam, are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Now I'm gonna give you a little time to think that over, and if you don't tell me the truth, I'm gonna put you across my knee.
And that goes for you too, Serena.
And don't think I can't do it.
I have to take these up to Tabitha.
She's waiting.
Mrs Kravitz.
I didn't know you were still here.
I thought I should stay, in case I could be of any help.
I really don't think it's I tried to get Mrs Stephens to lie down and rest, but she keeps insisting she's fine.
That's what they all say, you know.
Mrs Kravitz, I don't think you need to concern yourself any more.
Believe me, Mr Stephens, your wife has been behaving very strangely.
Darrin.
What brings you home so early?
I just told you in the kitchen that That must have been Serena you were talking to.
She's been keeping Tabitha entertained all day.
Mrs Kravitz, my cousin and I look very much alike, - and she has a very weird sense of humour.
- Oh?
We appreciate your concern, Mrs Kravitz, but as you can see, everything's fine, so you can run along home and Mind your Mind your way going across the street.
After all, you have gotten yourself a little overwrought.
You and your cousin certainly bear a remarkable resemblance.
I could still swear it was you all the time.
I know.
Serena even confuses me sometimes.
- You sure you're all right?
- Perfectly.
So, thank you very much, Mrs Kravitz.
Samantha, your freaked-out cousin has done some wild, wacky things, but this I don't understand.
Maybe she's upset because we punished Tabitha.
You know she's a real softy, down deep.
Inside.
Sure.
And it's none of her business - what we do with Tabitha.
- She may still be hanging around.
I'm sure she is, upside down from a rafter in the attic.
Darrin.
Will you relax before you make things worse?
- Speaking of worse, I've got to call Larry.
- Why do you have to call Larry?
To break a dinner date, I'm not surprised, I forgot to tell you about.
He took the liberty of asking the Nickersons over again tonight, and they were supposed to arrive early for cocktails.
Oh, honey.
Now there's no reason to cancel dinner.
I can whip up something.
Sure.
So can Serena.
Don't worry about her.
She's like a child.
Her attention span is highly limited.
She's had her fun for the day.
I don't think she'll be back.
And what about you?
This has been a hectic day.
Will you stop worrying?
I'm fine.
You don't let me get started with dinner, you will have something to worry about.
- Sam, you know something?
- What?
You're a witch in a million.
That's Daddy's big boy.
He's gonna grow up to be a linebacker, aren't you, fella?
Just our luck they're on time.
Well, we're ready.
I'll take Adam upstairs and check on Tabitha while you answer the door.
Isn't that right?
What was that?
Well, come on.
Let's go.
Okay.
Here we go.
Here we go.
- Oh, Darrin.
Here we are, right on the dot.
- Larry.
Mr and Mrs Nickerson.
Good evening.
Nice of you - to have us back so soon, Stephens.
- It's our pleasure.
I hope it isn't too much of an imposition on you and your wife, Mr Stephens.
It isn't an imposition at all.
It's our pleasure.
Well, Stephens, that's a very special little lady you have there.
- I know.
- And a very special little baby boy.
He's the cutest little baby I've ever seen.
- And he's an absolute angel.
- Why, sure.
Any toofens in there?
Show me.
- Let me see the little - About one and a half teeth, I think.
Well, as much as Adam is enjoying all this attention, I think it's time he went to bed.
Sweetheart, there's a tray of hors d'oeuvres in the refrigerator.
Night-night.
- Nighty-night.
- Good night, young fellow.
- Bye-bye, Adam.
- Goodnight, Adam.
Come on in.
Make yourself at home.
Come on.
Come on.
You have to dress just like Mommy.
Yes, Tate.
I'll be down to your office early in the morning to sign the papers.
I fully approve of Stephens' new concept.
Well, that's good news, Mr Nickerson.
I'm particularly pleased with the way Stephens worked up my ideas.
- Good evening, everyone.
- Well, that was fast.
Well, little Adam certainly doesn't give you any trouble when you put him down, does he?
- That little angel.
- I don't pay much attention to him.
I wanted Tabitha to come down and say hello to everyone.
- She's my little angel.
- Hi, Tabitha.
- You remember Mr and Mrs Nickerson?
- How do you do?
Good evening, little lady.
It's nice to see you again, Tabitha.
Tabitha is the most perfect child anyone could wish for.
- Thank you, Mommy.
- You're welcome, my little darling.
Okay, Tabitha.
You run up to bed now.
Oh, look, Tabitha.
More goodies for you.
Those goodies are for the adults.
I consider Tabitha an adult.
My, she is getting to be a big girl, isn't she?
She's big, she's smart, she's pretty, she's good as gold.
I am the luckiest mother in the world to have a little girl like Tabitha.
I should say you are.
A pretty big girl and a handsome little boy.
Little boy?
What little boy?
You're quite a kidder, Sam.
Take Tabitha upstairs, Sam.
This is not the children's hour.
I want to go up to my room now, Mommy.
My tummy feels like I've had enough.
Well, all right, my little precious.
Whatever you want.
Come along.
Goodnight, Tabitha.
Tabitha, sweetheart, are you sure you don't want to play another game of hide-and-seek?
I don't feel like playing any more.
All right, Serena.
Just what do you think you're up to?
Serena?
Serena, who?
I told you, Mommy.
It's not Serena.
It isn't?
It isn't.
It's my very own special mommy that I don't have to share with anyone.
I wished her.
- Why did you do that?
- Because you're so busy with the baby.
Oh, Tabitha.
I am busy with the baby because he's little, just like you used to be.
But that doesn't mean I don't love you as much as ever.
Mommy, my tummy hurts.
I think I ate too much today.
I'll get you something to make you feel better.
Now, you wish your very own special mommy, who spoils you rotten, to go away.
And remember, real mommies sometimes have to say no.
But it still means I love you, okay?
Okay, Mommy.
Oh, my Oh, my goodness.
- Sweetheart?
- Honey, your drink's on the table there.
Oh, thanks.
Tabitha helped me feed Adam, and helped me give him his bath, and she did very well, too.
So tomorrow I'm gonna take her to the play park, and then we're gonna go shopping for a new dress.
- Are you sure you're not overcompensating?
- Not at all.
I just want her to know that the women around here still have equal rights, no matter how handsome and attractive the men are.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Hello, Mrs Kravitz.
How is she, Mr Stephens?
Does she still seem all right?
She's fine, Mrs Kravitz.
Of course, that's what they all say.
I hope you're watching for any sign of a relapse.
And remember, Mr Stephens, if you need me anytime, I'm right here, just across the street.
Great news.
Hurricane Gladys is right off your starboard bow.
Thank you, Mrs Kravitz.
I'll keep that in mind.
Goodbye.
That Mrs Kravitz is something else.
But thankfully the whole nightmare is over.
You have a lot more than that to be thankful for.
- I know.
I know.
You, Tabitha, Adam.
- No.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
You can be thankful that it was not Serena who was entertaining Tabitha all day yesterday.
- Why?
- Darrin.
If she had overheard some of the things you said about her, wacky, freaked-out, hanging from her toes in the attic.
She's very sensitive, you know.
She might have turned you into a toad.
Sam, what would you do if one of your family turned me into a toad?
That's easy.
I'd just turn myself into a toad and hop right on your lily pad.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Hi.
Want some more coffee?
- Yeah.
I think it's awful Larry's making you work on Sunday.
He knows it's your regular golf day.
By tomorrow morning, I've got to come up with something ingenious for the Top Pop account or it's going out the window.
- Lf it does, I may be next.
- You mean Larry threatened you again.
Not in so many words.
He just said he'd hate to see a man with such a bright future get shot down.
- I see.
You just read between the lines, huh?
- Right.
Well, at least you could work out on the patio and get some sun.
- Sam, I'm fine.
- You could use it.
- Sam.
- I'm going.
Hiya, gorgeous!
- Sam!
- Got a riddle for you.
What's worse than finding a worm in an apple?
- Finding you in the mirror.
- No!
Finding half a worm.
See, half a worm is worse than a whole worm because - Oh, forget it.
- Yes, Darrin, what is it?
Oh, Uncle Arthur.
- Hiya, Sammy.
- You get out of there this minute.
Didn't have anything better to do, so I thought I'd drop in and see you and the old point-killer.
- I said, out.
- Okay, okay.
What happened?
For your information, this mirror happens to be a valuable antique.
- Somebody took you.
- Sam.
Don't get your giblets in an uproar.
I'll have it back together in a jiffy.
It may take another little jiffy.
Uncle Arthur, is there something the matter with you?
Of course not.
That mirror must have a hex on it.
You've got another mirror in the hall, haven't you?
Oh, now, wait a minute.
I don't think that's such a good idea.
Watch this, Sammy, then tell me I'm slipping.
- You're - Don't say it, Sammy.
- Another one of your antiques?
- It is now.
Uncle Arthur, maybe you're coming down with something, and it's affecting your powers.
Please let me call Dr Bombay.
I tell you, there's nothing wrong with me, and I'll prove it.
There's a mirror at the top of the stairs, right?
Sam, stop him!
I do wish he'd let me call the doctor.
Never mind the doctor, let's call our insurance man and see if we can get coverage for 21 years of bad luck.
- Twenty-one years?
- Three mirrors?
Seven years apiece?
There.
Now we only have 14 years' bad luck.
Darrin, I wish you'd try to be a little bit more understanding.
- Uncle Arthur's sick.
- You're telling me.
It's not a joking matter.
Could be an allergy or it could be something serious.
Oh, I do wish he'd let me call Dr Bombay.
I don't know how you expect me to work with that nut in the house.
Darrin, he is upstairs lying down and he isn't going to bother you, so why don't you go back to work?
- What happened?
- Sammy, call the doctor.
Now you're talking sense.
First, let me get you some towels.
Will you stop treating me like an invalid?
I'm just a little off my feed.
Let's go into the living room.
Why don't you take a walk around the block?
I know you're not too fond of Dr Bombay.
Oh, no.
Every man has the right to protect his home.
Calling Dr Bombay!
Calling Dr Bombay!
Emergency!
Come right away!
And I'm going to stay here and protect mine from that quack.
If you ever need brain surgery, don't hesitate to call.
It will only be a minor operation.
May I say, your timing is atrocious?
You got me right in the middle of the final match of the Witches International Chess Tournament, and I was playing under a terrible handicap.
- What was that?
- My king was drunk.
They play chess with live - Well, come along.
Who's the patient?
- Uncle Arthur.
I'll take your pulse first.
Sit down, leg up, left shoe off.
He's got the bedside manner of an orangutan.
Pulse is normal.
What seems to be the problem?
Right now, a sprained ankle, I think.
- Make that a broken ankle.
- We'll just check your blood pressure.
Ouch!
Are you sure your licence was reinstated?
Oh, my.
My, my.
- What is it?
Give it to me straight.
- You've got a shocking case of dandruff.
I know I have to put up with his malpractice, but about those jokes Dr Bombay, wouldn't it help if I told you what the symptoms are?
If you insist.
Well, his powers are a little erratic.
Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.
Either way, it's disaster.
- Hi, Darrin.
- Hi.
I was just passing by and I thought I'd stop in and, you know, give you an excuse for a break.
I didn't need any more excuses, but come on in the den.
- Who's that?
- Nobody you'd want to meet.
No doubt about it, this is a case of Bombay's Syndrome.
So called after its world-famous discoverer.
- What's Bombay's Syndrome?
- It means he's allergic to horse feathers.
- Horses don't have feathers.
- No?
What about winged horses?
He's right.
I rode in the Winged Horse Derby only last week.
- How'd you make out?
- Not too good.
I was riding a skittish filly, and she got her wings caught in the starting gate.
That's it.
Fortunately, I have the cure.
- You expect me to swallow a pill that size?
- I'll give you an assist.
Stand up, face me, mouth open, eyes closed.
There we are.
If he doesn't choke, he should be all right.
- It worked in three out of four cases.
- What happened to the fourth?
If science is to advance, some sacrifices must be made.
Why, you charlatan!
I'll teach you to experiment on me!
Uncle Arthur, please!
I can't stand these over-effusive thank-you's.
Cheerio!
- You got an angle on the slogan yet?
- Yes, but I'm not ready to discuss it.
Darrin, I have to be in Chicago at 10:00 in the morning to show it to the Top Pop people.
- Can't you give me a hint?
- Well - This is just a rough draft, you understand.
- I know, I know.
You're right.
You're not ready.
Uncle Arthur, before you have a fit, why don't you see if the pill worked?
But don't try it on any more mirrors.
Okay.
Have you ever seen me palm a half-dollar?
Watch closely.
Oh, Uncle Arthur, thank heavens you're back to normal.
How long do you think you'll be in Chicago?
- Quick, get rid of it.
- But I haven't done the trick yet.
If everything goes well, I should be back by Wednesday.
Very good.
Uncle Arthur, Larry and Darrin are Hi, Larry.
You remember my Uncle Arthur.
- Sure.
Nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you.
How's Louise?
- Who?
- Your wife.
Oh, she's fine.
Yeah, I saw her at the office last week, and she looked just fine.
- You look fine, Sam.
- I feel fine.
You're probably wondering what this is doing here.
No, but I'd say you've over-fertilised your carpet.
What is it doing here?
It's Uncle Arthur's new line.
- You're a tree salesman?
- No, I'm a fortuneteller.
I read palms.
Larry, you don't want to miss your plane.
Nice to see you and good luck.
Wait a minute.
I'm not leaving till tomorrow.
I know, I know.
I just wanted to give you an excuse to get out of there.
- Her uncle isn't entirely You know.
- I wondered about that.
Ready for this one, Sammy?
Name of a famous resort.
You'll never get it.
Palm Springs.
That tears it.
Either he goes or I do.
Oh, I don't want you to have any trouble on my account.
Can I help you pack?
I just bombed out with Larry and all because of him.
How do you expect me to concentrate?
Sweetheart, as a matter of fact, Uncle Arthur's feeling much better.
Well, better isn't good enough.
Is he well enough to travel?
I am happy to report, I feel as frisky as a colt.
- Good grief!
- Swell.
Oh, Uncle Arthur.
Uncle Arthur, come out of it.
Uncle Arthur.
Sammy, what happened?
Well, let's just say you were horsing around.
That pill has a terrible side effect.
I think we should get Dr Bombay back.
I don't think I can go through that again.
Maybe I'll take an hour off and go out to the driving range.
No, wait.
Don't leave on my account.
You know, you're making me feel about as welcome as an Indian at Custer's last stand.
- Oh, no!
- That's a terrible tic he's got.
Uncle Arthur!
Uncle Arthur!
Madam, my name Sitting Bull.
I don't think he's coming out of this one so easily.
I think I will go out to the driving range.
I've gotta hit something.
Yeah, why don't you do that?
There's nothing you can do here anyway.
I'll try and get all this straightened out before you get back.
I'd appreciate it.
But if you can't, I'll certainly understand.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
And you can reach me at the Regency Hotel.
Boy, has he got the blue meanies.
I wonder why Dr Bombay hasn't answered any of my calls.
- Want to know what I think?
- No!
Forgive me, Uncle Arthur.
It's just that every time you tell me what you think, you turn into something.
Now, Darrin's going to be home in an hour, and if this is still going on, he has every right to scream.
Uncle Arthur.
Uncle Arthur.
What happened?
I don't know.
I was just sitting here, feeling like the devil.
Oh, terrific.
Uncle Arthur, we have to get your mind off yourself.
It's obvious that Dr Bombay is not gonna show until after that chess match.
How about taking a little ride with me?
- You got a broomstick built for two?
- I mean in the car.
As a matter of fact, I'll even teach you how to drive.
Sammy, it so happens I know how to drive.
But why bother with a car when we can fly?
In your condition?
And it wouldn't do you any harm to brush up on your driving just in case.
Just in case what?
Well, suppose Dr Bombay can't restore your powers and you're grounded?
Gee, you're a regular Pollyanna, aren't you?
Sam, someone sold you a lemon.
There's no clutch in this car.
Uncle Arthur, what was the last car you drove?
- Well, as I recall, it was a Stutz Bearcat.
- Oh.
Well, cars have come a long way since then.
Everything's automatic now.
You don't say?
Well, that should make it even easier.
Okay, turn the key on.
Put your foot on the gas.
There you go.
Now, to go forward, move the gearshift to "D".
"D"?
Shouldn't it be "G" for "Go"?
I always thought it should be "F" for "Forward".
Here we go!
- Put on the brake!
- I don't see any "B"!
Stop, Uncle Arthur!
- Uncle Arthur, why didn't you stop?
- You told me it was all automatic.
You told me you knew how to drive.
- So I'm a little rusty.
- A little?
Oh, Sammy, it's no use.
I've just gotta fly.
It's in my blood.
When I'm up there in that big, blue yonder, I feel like Superman.
Oh, my stars!
Uncle Arthur, get out of that thing before somebody sees you.
Faster than a speeding bullet!
More powerful than a locomotive!
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound!
Uncle Arthur, let's go back in the house.
Look!
Up in the sky.
It's a bird.
It's a plane.
No!
It's Superman!
Up, up and away!
Uncle Arthur!
Come back!
The Federal Aviation people aren't gonna like this!
The Flying Nun's not gonna be too happy about it either!
- Hi, Spence.
- Oh, hello, Mr Tate.
- May I have a bucket of balls, please?
- Sure.
- Your friend Stephens is over there.
- Oh, really?
Okay, let's hear it.
Hi, Larry.
Hear what?
I assume you wouldn't be out here wasting precious time if you didn't have a winner for Top Pop, so let's hear it.
Well, I did have a glimmer of an idea, and I thought the fresh air would Darrin, I can't go to Chicago tomorrow with a glimmer in my pocket.
Okay, okay.
I'm going back to work as soon as I finish that bucket of balls.
I've got news for you.
You just finished it.
And to show you how dedicated I am, I'm going to escort you safely home.
Oh, Uncle Arthur, please!
- Will you please come down from there?
- No!
We've had quite a few calls about this.
What's going on here?
Well, actually, Officer, there's nothing wrong, nothing at all.
- There isn't?
- No.
You see, he's my uncle and How does he do that?
Well, my husband can tell you more about that than I can.
Tell them, Darrin.
Tell them about the wires.
The wires?
Oh, yes, the wires.
It's all done with wires.
Well, how come we don't see the wires?
The reason for that is because Darrin, don't say a word.
If you reveal that, anyone can copy it.
Oh, yeah, thanks for reminding me.
Almost blew it.
- What is this all about?
- Tell him, Sam.
- Oh, I bet you can guess.
- Yeah, yeah.
Take a guess.
- Is it for one of our accounts?
- You guessed it!
- Which one?
- Which one do you think?
Wait a minute!
I get it now!
You sly devil, this is for the Top Pop account, isn't it?
- Well, it - What a terrific idea.
Using an established character with a pre-sold audience.
You see, Darrin?
Larry likes it.
- Like it?
I love it!
- You do?
Yes!
Now tell me what it's all about.
Yes.
Well, now, let me see.
How does that go again?
"Try Top Pop.
It's groovy, man.
It's tasty, man.
It's super, man".
"It's super, man"?
- Hey, that's catchy.
- I think it's sensational.
Sensational.
I knew somebody would come up with the right word.
But, Darrin, you didn't have to go to all this trouble.
You could've just told me about it.
Well, somehow or other, Larry, when I have an idea on the drawing board, it's hard for you to see.
So I thought I'd put it up there where you couldn't miss it.
- I'm sorry you had to come out for nothing.
- Oh, forget it, lady.
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
So long.
Why, it's your Uncle Arthur.
How did you do that?
How do I do it?
How do you think?
I'm Superman.
Great sense of humour.
Darrin, you've done it again.
- Oh, thanks.
- Now, how did you do it?
Well, actually, Sam has a better grasp of this than I do.
Well, it's a new thing.
It's a one-man jetpack.
- Under the cape.
- No kidding?
- How come we didn't see any smoke?
- That's what's new about it.
- Let me see it.
- Please!
One does not touch the person of Superman.
Oh, he's a riot!
Well, speaking of riots, why don't we all go inside before we start one?
Sam, you've been waiting all afternoon.
What makes you think that idiot Bombay is gonna show up at all?
Because in hundreds of years of rendering service to my patients, I have never failed to respond sooner or later.
And it would have been sooner, except some wise guy passed a bottle of bourbon around to all my chess pieces.
Well, well, well, well.
What seems to be the problem?
I'll tell you what the problem is, you nincompoop.
I refuse to listen unless I'm addressed by my proper title.
Okay.
"Doctor".
Nincompoop.
Uncle Arthur, please.
That pill you gave him had a terrible side effect.
- Turned into all sorts of things, did he?
- Yes.
That's the big drawback with those pills.
This will cure the side effects.
- Just pop one of these into your mouth.
- Wait a minute!
- How do you feel?
- Well, I I feel like a newborn babe.
You're cured.
Yes.
What was in the pill?
I haven't the foggiest notion.
I buy them at the drugstore.
- Goodbye, all.
- I wish I'd voted for Medicare.
Well, I'm glad to see you're back to normal.
If you have to rush off, don't apologise.
You mean you want me to vacate the premises?
- That's the general idea.
- My pleasure.
I really crack you up, don't I?
Ciao, baby.
Sorry, sweetheart.
I guess we spoiled the whole day for you.
Not the whole day, just the part between sunrise and sunset.
Then I'd say we have a moral obligation to make the most of the evening.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, goodness.
Well!
While everyone's at the ball, Cinderella toils.
- Excuse me.
- Have you cleaned the chimney yet?
No.
That's on tomorrow's schedule.
Oh, Samantha, why don't you face the truth?
That husband of yours hasn't an ounce of ambition.
You've been married all these years, and you're still living in this hovel.
Mother, a hovel is in the eyes of the beholder.
And when it comes to ambition, Darrin has more drive and works harder than Sam, have I got Well, you're not dressed yet.
You'll be late for work.
I'm not going to work today.
I just called Larry and told him I'm taking the morning off.
I've decided to play a relaxed nine holes of golf instead.
Well, if it isn't Horatio Alger.
Sam, have I got any clean golf shirts?
Yes.
They're right over here.
I just finished them.
Good.
I'll go up and change.
I can hardly wait to try out those new irons I bought.
- He has his irons, and you have yours.
- Mother.
And you're certainly right about his drive, it's taking him right to the golf course.
Mother, a man like Darrin, who works with ideas, doesn't have to sit behind a desk.
An inspiration can strike him anywhere.
Really?
I wish I was an inspiration.
- I'd strike him right in the - Mother!
Knock it off.
Blind.
Blind as a woman in love.
Why, oh, why can't she see that Dum-Dum is going no place fast?
What he needs is a dose of ambition.
Yes.
A good strong dose of ambition.
It might not help, but it won't hurt.
Well, good afternoon.
- What are you doing in my office?
- I was about to have the furniture removed.
I thought you'd quit.
Larry, there's no reason to get snide.
I told you I was gonna play golf this morning.
I was half asleep when you called.
Feel that.
Feels like a tennis racket.
That's not just a tennis racket, it's a Braddock racket.
Braddock quality is unsurpassed.
The workmanship can't be duplicated at any price.
Handling this account has been one of the biggest pushovers I've ever had.
Don't you ever give up?
- What do you mean?
- I've already told you.
I can't take on the Braddock account.
I just don't have time.
Well, I wasn't trying to talk you into handling it.
No?
Good.
But I'd still like to hear one good reason why you can't.
Because there are only 24 hours in the day.
Darrin, will you stop kidding around and give me one good reason?
I just gave you plenty of good reasons.
Wait a minute.
I'm finally getting it.
You want a raise.
No, I don't want a raise.
- How much of a raise?
- Oh, come on, Larry.
Darrin, I'll be honest with you.
I haven't been doing too well with Braddock.
He's a little younger than I am.
The athletic type.
So I think you two would hit it off a lot better.
That's the only reason I wanted you to handle it.
So will you take a couple of hours and think about it?
A mogul, a magnate, a ruthless big deal.
Ambition and power is what you now feel.
Wait a minute, Larry.
I've just thought it over.
I'll take it.
You will?
How come you changed your mind?
Because you asked me to, because it's an important account, because you are my chief, and because of the raise.
- Raise?
What raise?
- Larry.
Oh, that raise.
We'll talk about it.
Talk is cheap.
My raise won't be.
We'll talk about it when we see how you hit it off with Braddock.
I have a lunch date with him today, and you're invited.
I'll be there with bells on.
Just come as you are.
Betty, bring in the file on the Braddock account.
And while you're at it, bring in the personal folder on Braddock himself.
It's too bad you didn't see that fight last night, Tate.
It was a beauty.
The champ just kept jabbing away and jabbing away, and then, bam, a left hook and it was all over.
How come you missed it?
I thought you told me you were a fight fan.
Oh, I am, I am.
But at the time I was attending a much more important fight, with my wife.
- Who won?
- It was a draw.
Oh, there he is.
Yes, sir.
Leave it to me.
Looks like a nice chap.
Clean-cut, fit.
Oh, they don't come any cleaner-cut or fitter.
I like that.
Braddock Sporting Goods likes to use men who look like they use their products.
Yes, sir, fitness counts.
Darrin Stephens, this is Bob Braddock.
- Mr Braddock.
- Hi.
- Good to meet you.
- Thank you.
- Sorry I'm late, but gym, you know.
- Jim who?
Larry, I told you I was gonna work out at the gym before lunch.
Oh, that gym.
Sure.
As I always say, mens sana in corpore sano.
That's funny.
- That's always been my motto.
- Is that right?
Terrific motto.
Mens sana in In corpore sano.
"A healthy mind in a healthy body".
Oh.
That is terrific.
How about a cocktail?
In the middle of the day?
You know me better than that, Larry.
Isn't that interesting?
You know, I'll bet you and me are the only two men I know who don't drink in the afternoon.
Make that three men.
You know, you look so familiar, Mr Braddock.
- Missouri, '53?
- Oh, no.
Wisconsin, '47.
Let me guess.
Basketball.
Track.
Ran the 100.
No kidding.
So did I. - What was your time?
- What was yours?
- 10.2.
- Mine was 10.3.
Beat you.
Excuse me, Mr Tate.
There's a telephone call for you.
Oh.
Be right back.
- Nice guy.
- Larry?
He's a prince.
The thing I like most about him is he's not a credit grabber.
If we score with a client, he doesn't hesitate to say that I was responsible.
- You know, Mr Braddock - Bob.
Bob.
In my opinion, Larry Tate's one of the best executives I've ever known.
Well, a good executive is one who surrounds himself with top talent.
Oh, thank you.
Larry's the main reason I stay at McMann & Tate.
There's no greater satisfaction in the world than being needed.
You know, you're quite a guy yourself, Stephens.
I'm surprised Tate doesn't make you a partner.
Well, I'm satisfied just to do the work and let Larry reap the benefit.
That's strange.
When I got to the phone, no one was on it.
Well, don't worry about that.
You left me in very good hands.
McMann & Tate has the best hands in the business.
You mean you hire the best hands in the business.
Sam?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
I have regards for you from Louise and Mrs McMann.
Oh, yeah, the lunch.
How did it go?
- Did they have anything to say about me?
- What makes you think we talked about you?
I just assumed you'd bring the subject up.
Making an impression on the bosses' wives doesn't hurt, you know?
Darrin, you're kidding.
Well, just half kidding.
How was the lunch?
Well, the food wasn't anything, - but we did raise quite a - Speaking of lunch, I took over the Braddock account today, and by the end of lunch, I had him in my back pocket.
Hey, that's great.
- Darrin, you know we raised over $3,000 - You know, I forgot to mention that Braddock told Larry he doesn't want anybody in the shop but me to handle the account.
Hey, that's terrific.
We haven't even counted the mail pledges yet, and I forgot the most important thing.
Larry is giving me a raise.
Sam, I tell you, there is no stopping me.
Apparently not.
But do you think you could stop long enough for dinner?
- We're having chicken.
- That reminds me.
That raise Larry gave me is just chicken feed.
Why should I have to sit around and wait for crumbs?
The chicken is breaded, if that'll help.
Do you know what we're gonna do?
We're gonna start inviting people over for dinner.
Important people, people who count, people who can do something for me.
Darrin, I think you had something besides lunch for lunch.
We should have Mr McMann over for dinner.
It certainly can't hurt to entertain the president and the chairman of the board of the company.
And Larry and Louise.
Sam, do you know I could control every account in that agency if I wanted to?
I could get Larry's job if I wanted it.
- Darrin - And I want it!
Sam, I'm going to invite the McManns over to dinner tomorrow night.
The Braddock account is just the beginning.
Next I'll take over the agency.
You see, this is the age of conglomerates.
You start with one little company and then merge with another little company, and then you're a big company.
Then you take your big company and you merge with another big company and Darrin, you're taking all the oxygen out of the room.
- Lf you'll excuse me, I'll start dinner.
- Sam?
You're gonna have everything your heart desires.
Everything except someone to have dinner with.
Mother, may I congratulate you?
This is one of the nastiest spells you have ever put on Darrin.
Now I'm trying to be nice about this, but if you prefer, I'll start yelling.
Mother!
I'm exhausted.
- I just flew back from Venus.
- I don't want to hear about it.
I planted a broom up there.
It's ours now.
And, meanwhile, down here, Darrin has become a power-driven monster.
- A little dose of ambition won't hurt him.
- A little dose?
Mother, believe me when I tell you, you have overdone it a lot.
Darrin is so power mad that he hasn't even got time to say hello to his children or have dinner with his wife.
Oh, Samantha, there'll be plenty of time for hellos and dinners when Durwood is a multimillionaire.
- Till then, ta-ta.
- Mother, wait.
I can't, darling.
I'm due in the decontamination chamber.
Mother!
Mother!
What about decontaminating this house?
Sam, the McManns'll be here any minute.
Are you about ready?
Yeah, I'll be ready in a second, sweetheart.
That must be them.
Sam, will you hurry up?
Opportunity is ringing our bell.
Darrin, before you go downstairs, I want to tell you something.
Well, your sudden desire for money and power, it's because of the spell Mother put on you.
Sam, this is one time when you're absolutely wrong.
- Your mother did not put a spell on me.
- Then how do you explain your behaviour?
I'm only behaving like any guy who wants better things for his family.
Darrin, I'm perfectly happy with everything I have, and you knew that until Mother stuck her two cents in.
What's two cents when I'm talking about millions?
Sam, will you hurry up?
I just have one more little thing to do - and then I'll be right down.
- Okay.
Then at lunch yesterday, he put on a performance you wouldn't believe.
He had Braddock in the palm of his hand.
Well, isn't that what he's supposed to do?
Sure, but when I came back to the table, he and Braddock seemed to be sharing some kind of a secret.
They looked at me and grinned.
Larry Tate, don't be late.
Call McMann.
He holds your fate.
You're so uptight, Larry.
Why don't we go to a movie and relax?
Good idea.
We haven't seen a good McMann in weeks.
A what?
The McManns.
I was just thinking.
Why don't we call them up and play a little bridge?
But we always fight when we play bridge.
We also fight when we're not playing bridge.
Call them.
- Gin and tonic for you, Mrs McMann.
- Yes, I agree with Thank you.
And Mr McMann, double Scotch and water, - right?
- Right.
And drink this one more slowly, Howard.
Larry tells me that you are handling the Braddock account, and doing a marvellous job.
Thank you, sir.
Of course, I'm not doing half the job Larry could have done, fifteen years ago, when he was a ball of fire.
Yes, Larry was tops in his time.
He's good now, too.
He has some marvellous ideas, and the fact that they're a little old-fashioned just adds to our image of stability.
Oh, our reputation is solid.
No doubt about that.
The only problem with the old-fashioned approach is that the market is narrowing down to the younger people, and that old-fashioned stuff just isn't where it's at.
It's not what they're into, as they say.
Yeah.
Yeah, you got a point there.
I'll get some more hors d'oeuvre.
But on the other hand, now Larry has surrounded himself with young, vital people.
- I mean, like yourself.
- Well, of course, he has.
Larry's done everything possible to keep up with the times, and he's done quite well, very well, most of the time.
I wonder if maybe Larry needs a rest.
Well, I'll tell you, Mr McMann Howard.
Larry has been at this game a long time.
A rest might do him good.
He's not looking too well.
He certainly deserves a vacation.
Maybe a good long one.
Let the young people take over.
Men like you, Darrin.
As a matter of fact, why not you yourself?
Why, Howard, I'm shocked.
Sam, did you hear that?
Yes, I did, and I'm just as shocked as you are.
- Care for a pig in a blanket?
- No, thanks.
- Mr McMann?
- Oh, no, thank you.
I'll get it.
Excuse me.
Samantha, you ought to be mighty proud of that man of yours.
There's no holding him down.
We could try tying him.
Larry, Louise.
Well, I wasn't expecting you.
I know.
We were just in the neighbourhood.
Thought we'd drop in for a drink.
Hi, Larry, Louise, come right on in.
- Thank you, Sam.
- Don't you look lovely.
Hey, Louise, look who's here.
The McManns.
- You look lovely, Margaret.
- Thank you.
- How are you?
- Howard, how nice to see you.
Well, Larry, what a coincidence.
You know, I was just about to suggest to Darrin that we get together and have a meeting tomorrow morning.
- Sure.
What about?
- How about a drink, Larry?
Don't mind if I do.
- What would you like, Louise?
- Scotch and soda would be nice.
Freshen mine up, too, Darrin.
Make it another double.
Not so much water.
As a matter of fact, forget the water.
- Wasn't that luncheon smashing today?
- Excuse me, honey.
- Yes.
- I had absolutely no What the devil are you up to, anyway?
Larry, I've made some decisions.
There's really no reason why we have to wait till tomorrow to discuss it.
There are gonna be some big changes at McMann & Tate.
First First I think I'll have that drink.
Howard.
That's pretty good, Stephensy.
Think I'll have another of the same.
This time forget the ice.
As I was saying, I've decided on some changes to be made at McTate & Mann.
And, I've decided that Darrin makes a mighty fine drink.
Now I'll get right to the point.
Mother!
You are destroying a friendship and a business association, and I don't think that's what you had in mind.
Mother!
Oh!
I was bronco-busting in Texas when you called.
But it's just as well.
- The only thing I was busting was my - Mother!
Please spare me the explanations, just lift the spell.
Oh, all right.
If you insist on being so completely provincial and narrow-minded, suit yourself.
Elephants trumpet, bees buzz, make Dum-Dum the little old drudge he was.
So long, y'all.
Mother!
Sam, what happened?
You were about to throw Larry to the wolves.
Yes.
I was, wasn't I?
You had almost convinced Mr McMann that Larry is a doddering old fool, and you are the perfect man to replace him.
I didn't say he was a doddering old fool.
Let's not nitpick.
The truth is, you were under a spell, and if you had listened to me earlier, you would have realised it.
Now what are we gonna do?
Well, you dug yourself into this trap, let's see how many strokes you need to get out.
You were saying?
Stephensy and I were talking about the fact that the biggest part of the market today, excuse me, honey, consists of young people.
Consequently, we need a young mind to lead the way.
And who would be more perfect in that than Than you, Larry.
If there's one thing I've always admired, it's the way you've kept in step with the times.
Me?
Well, I try.
Oh, Larry, you have a wonderfully youthful outlook.
Why, thank you.
I'm confused.
We were discussing the necessity of young people more active in the agency, and, of course, in line with that Right, Mr McMann.
The young people should have a greater voice.
And thank goodness for the guidance of Larry that, that greater voice doesn't go wild.
I seem to have missed something.
See, the basic principle of advertising never changes.
Get their attention and tell them why your product is better than the next guy's.
That's what Larry always says.
Right?
I do say that, always.
You seem to be contradicting yourself.
Well, of course, I'm contradicting myself.
It's part of my philosophy.
See, I think it's healthy to shake things up once in a while, get the cobwebs out, you know?
- This is amazing.
- Howard?
Now you see what I go through with this young genius.
Don't try to make any sense out of what he says, just look at the results.
Well, I guess that's what's it at.
Where it is.
Right.
Well, I don't know about that, but it's time to serve dinner.
Well, we'd better be going.
Now don't be silly.
You're staying to dinner.
No, no, no.
We're not going to barge in.
- You're not barging in.
- Yes, we are.
So you're barging, but if you can't barge in on an old friend, where can you?
Right, old friend?
Right.
You son of a gun.
Louise, why don't you sit there?
- And, sweetheart, would you get - Did I say "amazing"?
Yes, dear, you did.
Well, I meant revolting.
But if those two guys are that crazy about each other, who am I to stand in their way?
- Would you like another drink, Mr McMann?
- Oh, no, thanks.
- But I do think I'd better eat something.
- Right this way.
- Come on, honey.
- Yes.
So you've finally come to your senses.
You're leaving Durwood.
I always said that my little girl would come back to me.
- Mother, hold it.
- Yes?
- I am not leaving Darrin.
- You're not?
No.
I'm leaving with him, on a trip, courtesy of Larry Tate.
It's a bonus for his work on the Braddock account.
We're leaving as soon as Esmeralda gets here.
You ready yet?
The cloud in my silver lining.
- Has Sam told you about the trip?
- Yes, and I hope you do.
Mother, I forgot.
- Guess what Darrin bought me.
- A new mop?
A magnificent new yacht.
Really?
Well, that is a surprise.
You see?
My zinging him with a little ambition didn't hurt.
- When do I get to see it?
- Right now, if you like.
Now?
Where is it docked?
Right over here.
It's nothing but a toy.
It's unsinkable, un-sailable And unbelievable.
And the only kind of yacht I care to own.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Hi, little cousin!
Serena.
You made me lose my spoon.
I'll get it for you.
Thanks a lot.
What kind of potion are you brewing?
- Beef stew for tonight's dinner.
- How dreary.
Don't bother asking me to join you.
- Don't worry.
- Because I am dining in Paris at Maxim's.
I'm impressed.
Oh, Cousin, I have been travelling in high society.
As a matter of fact, I have just been elected entertainment chairman of the Cosmos Cotillion.
Really?
Who rigged the election?
I did.
Sam, I'm home.
Serena, if you're flying to Paris, hadn't you better fly?
I have plenty of time.
I'm not due for 20 minutes.
Besides, I'd like to stay and say hello to tall, dark and mortal.
I'd rather you wouldn't.
Thanks, I'd love to.
Hi there, Cuz-in-law.
Well, Serena, what an unexpected shock.
Well, look who you brought with you.
Little Peter Cottontop.
- Hi, Serena.
- Hi.
- Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
How are you?
I'm feeling great, and I owe it all to Darrin "He's-Done-lt-Again" Stephens.
What did he do this time?
I just closed a deal for Breeze Shampoo, to sponsor a television special starring Boyce and Hart.
Boyce and Hart!
Hey, that's great.
Who's Boyce and Hart?
They're a very hot, young singing team.
They're happening.
They're now.
They're expensive.
But they're worth it.
Sam, I don't often admit my mistakes, but in this case, I must say I was totally against the idea, and Darrin went right over my head and convinced Breeze Shampoo to go after the youth market.
And now, of course, I'm backing him to the hilt.
This is their latest album.
See what you think of it.
I'd be glad to.
I meant Samantha.
You know something, Larry?
Those baby blue eyes of yours kind of turn me on.
Larry, why don't we take our drinks into the den, and we can go over the details.
Larry?
Serena, will you knock it off?
A girl's gotta have some kicks.
Well, do your kicking elsewhere, but don't think it hasn't been nice seeing you.
Say, they're kind of cute.
If these cats are any good I may have an idea.
Cousin, we play our records on our record player.
You do your thing, I'll do mine.
Yes, I wonder What she's doing tonight Oh, I wonder what she's doing Hey!
They're not bad.
They're pretty good.
I've heard enough.
- I have an idea.
- Forget it.
I am going to ask them to appear at the Cosmos Cotillion.
They'll be a smash!
Oh, Serena, be logical.
Why would you want mortals to appear at the cotillion?
Why not?
You married one.
Why can't I hire a couple?
Because some way, somehow, you're going to make trouble for Darrin.
Not only will I hire them for the cotillion, I'll let them introduce a new song I wrote.
- Serena.
- Sammy, will you stop worrying?
Would I ever let you down?
I wish I knew where I could make a bet on it.
If I had told her that I loved her She would've stayed till who knows when Here they come!
But I guess she couldn't understand it When I said I wanna be your friend Because a friend would never doubt you Or ever put you uptight And now I wonder What she's doing tonight Oh, yes, I wonder What she's doing tonight Oh, I wonder what she's doing Tonight You know, Bob, it's unbelievable.
That's the seventeenth shirt I've lost this week.
That's nothing.
You know what happened to me this morning?
- No, what?
- Some fans broke into my Ferrari, and messed up my mink upholstery.
All right, don't complain.
It only proves one thing, the public loves you.
Now sit down.
I want to give you my idea for a national chain of Boyce and Hart shish kebab stands.
Step aside, ladies.
Step aside.
Excuse me.
Pardon me, people.
Excuse me.
Step aside, sweetie.
I want to see Boyce and Hart.
Sorry, ladies, no visitors unless your name is on the pass list.
Look for the name Serena.
I looked when I came on duty, and there's no Serena.
Look again.
I guess I need a new pair of orbs.
Hold it!
Each skewer of shish kebab costs us 32 cents.
But we sell it for $1.05, plus tax.
- Hi, Tommy.
Hi, Bobby.
- Who are you, and how did you get in?
I'm Serena, and I have influence.
Who are you?
I'm Chick Cash.
I'm the boys' personal manager and treasurer of their Swiss corporation.
- Would you like an autograph?
- No, thanks.
- How about a torn shirt?
- No, thanks.
- I would like you to perform at a dance.
- Where?
In a place so beautiful, it is out of this world.
- And I provide the transportation.
- How much does it pay?
Nothing.
In my circle, money isn't important.
In my circle, it is.
The understatement of the century.
Okay, Mr Treasurer.
You just name a price, and I'll print it.
I mean, I'll pay it.
- When is your dance being held?
- A week from Saturday night.
They can't make it.
My artists are booked every single Saturday night from now until 1976.
Then do some juggling.
- It's impossible.
- I'll pay them double their normal fee.
It's a deal.
- Sweetie, may I buy you a drink?
- I'll pay them triple.
As an added incentive, I'll let them sing a song I wrote.
It's better than what they've been doing.
- The title is - I should have known!
Another song plugger!
Serena, it's been nice meeting you, and goodbye.
Are you asking me to leave?
No, I'm not asking you to leave, I'm demanding.
I see.
I guess I'll just have to show you fellas who you're fooling around with.
- Great.
- Do you leave quietly, or do we have to throw you out?
I am never thrown out, and I never leave quietly.
I stalk out in a huff!
And then I get revenge!
I think I'll turn them into snakes.
No, on second thought, we had singing snakes at the cotillion last year.
This programme is interrupted to bring you a sigalert from Serena.
Hi, Sammy.
Hi, Dreary.
Traffic is heavy on the corner of Boyce and Hart due to an accident which is about to take place unless they straighten out.
Serena, would you mind getting out of our television set?
Unless Sammy's hubby comes to their aid.
Now that you're out of our television set, would you mind getting off our carpet?
Darrin, mind your manners.
Serena, what's this about Boyce and Hart?
I am here on a mission of mercy.
They were rude to me.
I'm gonna hate myself for asking, but when did you see Boyce and Hart?
Just now.
I asked them to entertain at the Cosmos Cotillion, and their manager kicked me out.
You asked them to entertain at the Cosmos Cotillion?
- Yes.
- What's a Cosmos Cotillion?
Well, it's sort of a dinner dance.
- Sam, would you sort of get her out of here?
- I'll try.
That's the thanks I get for being sweet.
Sure.
The original Miss Nice Guy.
Would you rather I handle this in my own way?
Or would you prefer to be the hero and tell them that you will not use them on your television show, unless they sing my song at my cotillion?
Sam, will you do something before I say something?
It's called I'll Blow You a Kiss in the Wind.
A little guitar, a little atmosphere, and it wails like this.
Wherever you are tonight A feeling tells me that you look out of sight So I'm gonna blow you a kiss In the wind And when it reaches your lips, my dear You're gonna smile and feel me oh, so near So I'm gonna blow you a kiss In the wind I've been laying here in my bed, yeah The images of pretty thoughts Running through my head About a guy in my mind I can feel I can almost touch Oh, my goodness, I miss you And I want you so much Wherever you are tonight I got a feeling that you look out of sight So I'm gonna blow you a kiss In the wind, yeah I'm gonna blow you a kiss in the wind - How do you love it?
- I'll give you an unbiased opinion.
It stinks.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Cousin, may I please speak to you in private?
Certainly.
Are you going to make what's-his-face disappear or shall I?
Neither.
We will disappear.
Back in a minute, sweetheart.
Care for a midnight snack?
No.
Want to hear more of my song, or do you think it stinks, too?
Serena, I think it's terrific.
I think it's so terrific, it's too good for mortals.
So why don't you sing it yourself at the cotillion?
Because the lyric cries for a male vocalist or a male group.
Do yourself a favour.
Try and find a couple of guys who aren't quite as popular as Boyce and Hart.
Say, there's an idea.
- Then I've been of some help, right?
- Right.
Which rhymes with "good night".
Wrong.
Which rhymes with "my song," which the group of my choice is going to sing at my cotillion.
I am going to make them so unpopular they'll be desperate to sing anywhere.
As the trumpets blare, let all ears smart, failures both be Boyce and Hart.
Hey, troops, what are we waiting for?
That's right.
Who wants to see a couple of bums like Boyce and Hart?
Yeah!
Oh, Serena, you little dickens!
You are definitely where it's at.
Good morning, Samantha.
Has Darrin left yet?
No, he's just finishing breakfast.
Well, if he can still eat, he hasn't seen weekly Variety.
What's the matter?
You look worried.
I'm not worried.
Let's say I'm petrified.
- Hi, Larry.
Something up?
- No, something's down.
Did you see today's edition of weekly Variety?
- No, not yet.
- Well then, read it and weep.
- "Boyce and Hart, here today, gone today".
- What does that mean?
Well, the general idea is, Boyce and Hart have taken a nosedive.
They haven't sold a record in three days.
And booking agents all over the country have cancelled their concerts.
And at a meeting of their national fan club, Boyce and Hart photographs were burnt in effigy.
But why?
It doesn't say, but I have a theory.
So have I. - Why didn't you listen to me?
- When?
When I expressed unswerving opposition to putting those hippies on television.
You didn't express unswerving opposition.
When I made the deal, you were thrilled.
That's right.
I heard you right here in this very room.
Well, I may have been thrilled in this very room, but in my heart I was unswervingly opposed.
Undoubtedly, when this reaches the executives of Breeze Shampoo, they'll cancel the special and the account.
The way things look now, a show with Boyce and Hart won't sell their product, it'll cause a boycott.
But the way things look now aren't the way things looked then.
And the way things look now may not be the way things will look soon.
Because sometimes things don't always look like what they look like.
Samantha, that was a brave attempt to get Darrin off the hook.
It has no logic, but it was a brave attempt.
Darrin, I sincerely hope you can get yourself out of the mess you got yourself into.
I'm afraid even my genius can't save your neck this time.
Sorry, Sam.
Speaking of necks, would you ask Serena if she's available to attend a lynching?
Hers.
You know very well that Serena is not going to show up if you're going to be nasty.
Me?
Nasty?
Sam, how could she do such a thing?
Well, she probably wanted revenge.
Against Boyce and Hart for rejecting her offer?
Yes.
And against you for telling her, her song stinks.
Serena!
Serena?
Serena.
Had any concert offers lately, Chick?
- Nightclubs?
- Weddings?
- Bar mitzvahs?
- Nothing.
If it gets any worse, I'll have to start pawning your gold records.
Hi, gang.
Well, well, well.
Look who's here.
Cutest little song-plugger east of Motown.
Mr Cashman, I came to see if by some wild chance you might have reconsidered my offer to let your clients sing at my dance.
I take it you don't read Variety.
- When is your dance?
- Tonight.
At the price we agreed?
Five times their normal fee?
We agreed on three times their normal fee.
Right.
I thought it was five, but I'll give you a break.
And they could use the exposure.
Well, what time do you want them and where do they go?
We will leave here at 8:00, alone.
And here is a copy of the song I would like them to sing.
- I'll Blow You a Kiss in the Wind.
- Words and music by Serena.
What are all those black marks?
Beats me.
They're notes.
Don't you two read music?
- I do, he doesn't.
- I do, he doesn't.
Oh, well.
I'll explain it to you tonight when we rehearse.
You're cute.
Cute!
Larry, would you mind screaming more quietly?
That's better.
Now did Breeze Shampoo just cancel the special or their account?
They cancelled both.
And I said I didn't blame them.
But they can't do that.
We have a verbal contract.
Darrin, a verbal contract isn't worth the paper it's written on.
News bulletin.
Your son and daughter are sound asleep.
That's nice.
Now would you see if your cousin is available to be strangled?
Right.
We just lost Breeze Shampoo.
In the wind Well, it's almost 8:00.
Shall we go over the song again?
I don't think so.
We've already done it twice.
- No use getting stale on it.
- Well, all right, fellas.
You ready?
- Lead the way.
- We'll follow you anywhere.
- Now I want you both to close your eyes.
- What for?
I'm going to take you on a long, long trip.
- A trip?
On what?
- On a magic carpet.
Well, I'm sorry about that.
Now, close your little eyes.
Go on.
Don't peek.
Open your eyes.
- Where are we?
- Never mind that.
How did we get here?
It's called the Cosmos Club.
Isn't it heavenly?
Darrin, I've been trying to reach her for three days, but you know how stubborn she can be.
Rotten's the word.
I wish you'd at least try to be nice.
That was the nicest word I could think of.
Well, anyway, I know where to reach her tonight.
At the Cosmos Cotillion.
Hey, maybe you'd like to come with me.
After all, it's Saturday night.
- We could get all dressed up - Sam.
- Well?
- Good luck, sweetheart.
Back in a minute.
Thank you, thank you, galaxy groovers.
As your entertainment chairman, it is my bag to present the most unique and unusual acts possible.
Tonight I am gonna lay on you two swinging mortal singers, performing for the very first time, my brand-new, all-time hit.
I give you Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.
Wherever you are tonight A feeling tells me that you look out Okay, Serena.
Fun and games are over.
Let's send those howling hippies back to Earth.
I will, just as soon as they finish my song.
And when it reaches your lips, my dear You're gonna smile and feel me oh, so near So I'm gonna blow you a kiss In the wind I've been laying here in my bed Pretty images and pretty thoughts Running through my head About a girl in my mind I can feel I can almost touch Oh my goodness, I miss you And I want you so much Wherever you are tonight I got a feeling that you look out of sight So I'm gonna blow you a kiss In the wind I'm gonna blow you a kiss In the wind Oh, they loved it!
Sing it again!
Sing it again!
Serena, remove your spell.
How about just one more chorus?
Then you holler, "Author, author"!
No!
You send them back to earth immediately and make them popular again.
And while you're at it, make them not remember where they were, before I begin to get mad.
Okay.
Back from the cosmos to your planet, your career as bright as since you began it.
Forget where you were and what you did to keep my cousin from flipping her lid.
Thank you, Cuz.
You're welcome, Cuz.
Cotillion pooper.
- Are you all right, man?
- I think so.
- Oh, great.
You didn't leave yet.
- That's what you think.
Now listen.
When Serena gets here, don't go with her.
- Why not?
- We don't need her.
On my way to dinner, I got five telephone offers for you in my car.
- So book us in your car.
- Don't be so smart.
I think I've pulled you out of your slump.
But don't bother to thank me.
That's what managers are for.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
How were all the guys and gals in the cosmos?
Fine.
Did they sing Serena's song?
And everyone loved it.
And since that's what she wanted in the first place, she was very cooperative about solving your problem in the second place.
- What'd she do?
- She removed her spell.
Before you know it, Boyce and Hart will be bigger than ever.
And so will you with Breeze Shampoo.
That sounds like a slogan.
It's an apology.
An apology for what?
The occasional trouble my family causes you.
Occasional?
Okay, frequent.
Frequent?
Okay, constant.
But it does make life interesting, doesn't it?
Okay, forget it.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Come on.
Let's see if we can find something else.
Come on.
Hey, Tabitha, you think Emily would like a pair of skates?
No, Mommy.
She has skates.
I'll have a salesman for you in a moment, ma'am.
Mr Bates?
Mr Bates!
He's never around when I need him.
Oh, well, don't worry about us.
We're just browsing.
- Bates!
What are you doing?
- Just taking a little break, Mr Waterman.
A break from what?
You never work.
I see you're playing with the games again, while I'm swamped with customers.
- Sorry.
- Now get out there and do your job, while you still have one.
Trust me, ma'am.
You're always safe with a doll.
And this happens to be our newest model, Sassy Suzy.
It comes with a comb and a brush.
And listen.
I don't want to comb my hair.
Don't bug me.
Suzy should come with two brushes, one for each end.
Do you have a doll that's not quite as sassy as Suzy?
Well, here's a doll that doesn't talk at all.
Well, that's a novelty.
We'll take her.
All righty.
- She's only $9.95.
Is that cash or charge?
- Charge.
All right.
The cashier is right over there.
Would you like it gift wrapped?
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.
Tabitha, I'm going to be right over here at the cashier's, okay?
- Right over there.
- Okay, Mommy.
My, you certainly are a lucky little girl, going to a birthday party.
I know.
Have fun while you're a kid, Tabitha.
Because when you get to be an old adult like me, you have all sorts of things like responsibilities, a job, a boss.
Kids have got it made in this uptight world.
Don't you like being grown up?
Oh, sure.
But, boy, if I could be a kid again - You'd like to be a little boy?
- I sure would.
I had more fun when I was nine years old than I've had in all the years since.
- Okay, then say it.
- Say what?
Say, "I wish I were nine years old again".
Oh, I get it.
Make-believe, huh?
All right.
I wish I were nine years old again.
That's what's so great about being a child.
You have time for make-believe.
Make-believe?
Bye.
- Thank you.
Okay.
- Hey, little girl!
Well, little boy, what are you doing behind the counter?
I'm not a little boy, Mr Waterman.
I'm your salesman, Irving Bates.
- Okay, sonny.
What's the joke?
- This is no joke!
I was just talking to that little girl over there Hey!
She's gone!
Excuse me.
Mr Waterman, please, believe me.
I'm Irving Bates.
Now go away, little boy.
Madam, may I help you?
Our salesman seems to be hiding somewhere.
- But I'm your salesman!
- All right, sonny.
Obviously, Bates is paying you to torture me.
- Now, where is he?
- I told you, I'm Okay.
I'll tell you.
He's over in sporting goods goofing off.
Excuse me.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Here it is.
"Stephens, 1164 Morning Glory Circle, Westport".
Darn it!
Well, hi there, young fellow.
This your daddy's car?
No, it's mine.
I think I flooded the motor.
Well, hey, don't do that.
Don't do that, kid.
Do you want to cause an accident?
It's all right, Officer.
Just disregard my appearance.
I happen to be a grown man.
And I happen to be Bonnie Prince Charlie.
- Well, just give me the keys, huh?
- Now, look, nothing bugs me more than a puffed-up, overbearing cop.
Will you cut that out, you little mini-monster?
I mean, now, son, don't you think that before you start trying to drive, your feet should reach the pedals, huh?
Cut that out!
I happen to be 32 years old and a taxpayer.
Oh, boy, what an imagination.
I'll bet you're just great at show-and-tell time, huh?
- Okay, sonny, upsy-daisy.
- Put me down!
Knock it off with the police brutality!
I'm gonna sue!
Just Just calm Just calm down.
We're We're We're gonna take you to your parents.
- Where are Mommy and Daddy?
- They live that way.
- Yeah, well, exactly where?
- In Toledo, Ohio.
Toledo?
Come on, gramps!
Move this thing.
All right.
All right.
Don't get pushy.
Where to?
Hurry.
Just get this jalopy moving.
You're really getting an early start on that ulcer, aren't you?
Coming!
All right.
Hello there.
My, aren't we all dressed up this morning.
That's right.
And your daughter's the one who dressed me.
Just what exactly do you mean by that, young man?
I mean, I'm having a wild nightmare, and you and your daughter are in it.
Are you new in the neighbourhood?
Not only am I new in the neighbourhood, I'm a whole new size, thanks to your daughter.
What did she do?
There.
Look familiar?
Irving Bates.
Oh, now I know.
The toy salesman at Hanley's Department Store.
- Your father?
- No.
But you're close.
It's me.
Oh, my stars!
You'd better come in.
Tabitha!
Anyway, this is better than the nightmares I usually have - where I end up getting married.
- Did you want me, Mommy?
Oh, hi, mister.
Do you like being a little boy again?
- Tabitha, what happened?
- I just realised something.
- I dream in full colour.
- Mr Bates.
Look, this seems like an informal dream.
Why don't you call me Irving?
Okay, Irving.
I would like to talk to Tabitha for a minute.
- So you just keep right on dreaming.
- All right.
And if I wake up before you get back, nice meeting you.
Come with me.
All right, young lady.
Now you know you're not supposed to do things like that.
You change him back immediately.
But Irving said it would be fun to be a little boy again.
That doesn't mean he expected it to happen.
- Now, go ahead.
- Okay.
Tabitha, you're not trying.
Yes, I am, Mommy.
You wait here.
Irving, little boys do not play with matches.
I'm not a little boy.
I'm just having a dream.
Irving, I don't know how to tell you this, except to come right out and tell you this.
- Tell me what?
- You're not dreaming.
Oh, come on.
What do you call it when a full-grown man suddenly finds himself turned into a nine-year-old boy?
Well, there is a name for it.
What are you talking about?
How does the word "witchcraft" hit you?
You're pulling my leg.
No, Irving, not really.
You see, I am a witch.
So is Tabitha.
Well, I won't hold that against you.
I'm a liberal.
What am I saying?
There's no such thing as witches.
Then how do you explain your second childhood?
Well, I can explain that.
- I'd better call the cops.
- Be my guest, Irving.
But do you really think they're gonna believe you?
Why, of course.
They can see for themselves.
You're right.
I don't believe me.
I'll think of something.
Just try to be patient.
Patient?
You forget!
I'm on the missing list.
My boss is looking for me and Check that.
I'm sure to be fired by now.
I was supposed to meet my girl for lunch two hours ago!
I'll bet she's furious.
You'd better talk to her.
Tell her you're a friend of the family.
Her name's Ruthie.
Hello.
- Is this Ruthie?
- Yes, it is.
Well, I'm calling for Irving, and he's sorry he couldn't make lunch today.
- Who is this?
- Oh, this is a friend of the family.
And Irving wanted you to know that he's a little under the weather.
And why didn't he call me himself?
Well, because at the moment he's not quite up to it.
And are you nursing him back to health?
Yes.
I mean, no!
We're just good friends.
Well, you can tell Mr Irving Bates that he's stood me up for the last time.
And you can also tell him that he's a pretty small person.
But, Ruthie!
But - What happened?
- She hung up.
Swell.
I've lost my girl and my job.
If this isn't a nightmare, I'd better stay a little boy.
Oh, now, don't you worry, Irving.
We'll get you out of this mess.
Irving, that's my husband.
Now you just pretend you're a friend of Tabitha's.
Isn't she a little young for me?
- Just do as I say.
- What if I don't want to?
Do you see that?
No wonder you witches had so much trouble in Salem.
Now, you just do as I say, and we'll tend to your problem later.
- Right, Tabitha?
- Yes, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetheart.
How was the game?
- Great.
Hi, Tabitha.
Daddy, this is my new friend, Mr Bates.
She means Irving.
They were playing grown-ups.
- Hi, Irving.
- Hello.
Hey, feel that muscle.
I bet you like football, don't you, fellow?
- Did you have to do that?
- Do what?
- This.
- Irving, please.
Darrin, Irving is a very unusual child.
Tabitha, why don't you and Irving go and play on the patio?
- Okay, Mommy.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you, Irving?
All right.
I'll play with the kid.
- What have I got to lose?
- What has he got to lose?
Well, he already lost his marbles.
He doesn't want to lose anything else.
- Will you push me?
- Sure.
- Sam, what's with that little kid?
- What little kid?
I mean, that little kid, whatever his name is.
Darrin, why don't you get ready for lunch?
I'll tell you later.
You mean, Irving is going to join us for lunch?
Yes.
Maybe even dinner, with the outside possibility of breakfast.
Don't tell me he's going to spend the night.
- Okay, I won't.
- What, he's gonna spend the night?
Darrin, make up your mind.
Do you want to know or not?
- Sam!
- Well?
- I think I'll get ready for lunch.
- Good idea.
Tabitha, would you like me to stay around and be your big brother?
We could have fun all the time.
Well, then, why don't you just forget about trying to change me back?
Okay.
It might be fun starting out all over again.
And things are gonna be a lot different this time.
There.
Everything okay?
I don't want any milk!
How about a beer?
How about a punch in the nose?
I'll drink the milk.
All right, Sam.
Now, then.
You were going to tell me something about this youngster?
The name's Irving, fellow.
Irving, in this house, little boys and girls speak to adults with respect.
- Now, how old is he?
- He's older than he looks.
- I'm 32.
- Look, Irving, I wasn't talking to you.
I was What did he say?
I think he said he was 32.
Sam, what's going on here?
I'm glad you asked that, sweetheart.
Please, Samantha.
It's my story.
Let me.
This is the story of Irving and Tabitha.
See Irving.
See Tabitha.
See Irving sell toys.
See Tabitha go See Irving go You see, sweetheart, it's kind of a short story.
You mean Tabitha changed a 32-year-old man into this little boy?
You go to the head of the class, buster.
Now, look, sonny.
I mean, fellow.
Hit me!
I took karate!
No one's gonna hit anybody, and get down off that chair.
Now, Tabitha, how could you do such a thing?
- Like this, Daddy.
- Oh, never mind.
Sam, why doesn't she change him back?
Well, she's working on it, but it isn't working.
What are we gonna do with him?
Well, now, sweetheart, don't worry.
She'll change him back, and, well, if she can't Let's look at the bright side.
How many people get a second chance in life?
Irving has a great opportunity.
He can grow up all over again.
But where?
Where would he grow up all over again?
Well, darling, we can't just throw him out in the street.
That's right, Dad.
Please don't call me that.
Just think of the plus side, Darrin.
You'll get another deduction.
Samantha, I would like to speak to you in the living room, privately.
- When?
- Now.
Sam, do something.
There is one possible solution.
- What's that?
- Dr Bombay.
Under these circumstances, I'd even accept help from that quack.
Oh, now, Darrin.
Don't antagonise him.
He's the best witch doctor we have.
I wish you wouldn't call him that.
Calling Dr Bombay!
Calling Dr Bombay!
Emergency!
Come right away!
How dare you interrupt my Antarctic rounds?
Don't look at me.
That'll be a pleasure.
Dr Bombay, I'm sorry to call you on such short notice, but you are the family physician.
Well, I was in the middle of a delicate operation, but the patient will just have to wait.
- Was it serious?
- Oh, quite.
I was doing a nose job on a penguin.
Well, what's the earth-shattering problem this time?
Irving, Tabitha, would you come here, please?
Dr Bombay, until this morning, this little boy was known as Mr Irving Bates, a 32-year-old man.
Tabitha sort of shrunk him.
Now she can't un-shrink him.
Frankly, I'd just as soon remain shrunk.
Who's the ding-a-ling in the parka?
Irving!
Just show the doctor your driver's licence.
Here.
See?
That's what he looked like this morning.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I can see why he wants to remain shrunk.
Yes, if I were you, I'd want to remain a child for as long as possible.
Very funny.
Doctor, just save your bedside manner for the penguin.
We need your help.
Very well.
To work.
To work.
To work.
Now, we have a depressing situation here.
So, I'll need this.
Get it?
Tongue depressor.
Depressing.
Nothing.
Well, I'll just try a little test.
Eye of squid, grinding stone, make this kid fully grown.
Nothing happened.
Well, when that incantation fails, it can only mean one thing.
Samantha, I'd like a private consultation with you.
Do you have any pickled herring about?
I think so.
Come on, Irving, Tabitha.
Why didn't it work?
Obviously, resistance from the two principals, Tabitha and the boy.
Well, first, there's Irving's desire to remain a child, and, no doubt, Tabitha enjoys having another playmate.
Subconsciously, she's holding back.
Then what I have to do is get Irving to lose interest in remaining a little boy.
Brilliant prognosis.
I almost feel like splitting my fee with you.
Thank you, Doctor.
I said, almost.
Here's the herring.
What do you want it for?
The penguin owes me 500 fish for her nose job, and I haven't a bit of small change.
Before you say anything, I think the problem of Irving Bates is solved.
- Oh?
- Yes.
Well, it's obvious that Irving is enjoying being nine years old again.
I can think of some ways to change his mind.
I know exactly how to change his mind.
Sure, I'd like to see Ruthie again, just for my memory book.
Where does she work?
Down on 58th Street at the Drucker Travel Bureau.
Why?
How'd we do that?
We zonked across the atmospheric continuum.
- Huh?
- Never mind.
- Is that Ruthie?
- Yeah.
Hey, Ruthie!
It's me!
Yes, sonny.
May I help you?
No.
I was just browsing.
Ruthie sure is pretty.
Yeah.
She sure does look nice.
- Miss Campbell.
- Yes?
Ruthie, what are you doing this evening?
Nothing, Mr Drucker.
Do you have any extra work you'd like me to do tonight?
No, I would like you to come out and have dinner with me.
That old fink.
There'll be soft lights and sweet music.
Oh, Ruthie, I'm crazy about you.
But, Mr Drucker - Herman.
- I never knew you felt this way.
Neither did I. It just hit me like a ton of bricks.
It must have been building up for years.
But you're married.
What about your wife?
Try to forget about her.
I already have.
Well, I'm already spoken for.
You mean that schnook Irving Bates?
Yes, I mean that I mean Irving Bates.
Well, I'll make you forget him.
All right, Casanova.
You asked for it.
Why, you little Ruthie, I I mean, Miss Campbell.
I don't know what happened.
I'm very sorry.
Must be that stuff I'm taking for iron-poor blood.
I need to go out and get something cold to drink.
Oh, thanks, little boy!
Oh, that was such an adorable thing you did!
You're welcome.
I mean it.
That was really brave.
Sweetie, I wish I had more time for some more hugging and kissing, but there's something very important I have to tend to.
My, how mature we are for such a little man.
Honey, you have no idea.
So I'd better go.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Oh, I'd better get back on my liver pills.
But Irving wanted to be a little boy.
Irving only thought he wanted to be a little boy.
You see, honey.
People sometimes wish for things they don't really want, simply because they know their wish can't possibly come true.
That's right, but your mommy made me realise that even though I thought there was a lot wrong with my world, there was a lot right about it, too, like Ruthie.
Don't you think it's time you changed him back?
Okay, Mommy.
Hey, I'm me again!
That's right.
You're good as new, fit as a fiddle, and ready for Ruthie.
Samantha, would you do me a favour?
If I can.
Yeah.
Oh, you can do this.
Would you zonk me to Ruthie on one of your nonscheduled flights?
Would you mind, sweetheart?
Mind?
If I could do it, I'd do it myself.
- Okay.
- Before I go, I want you all to know, it's been some kind of an experience knowing you.
I mean, I've met a real witch.
And if I tell anybody, they'll put me in a real straightjacket.
And, Tabitha, thanks.
Being a kid again has sure helped me to grow up.
Okay, I'm ready for my flight.
Fine.
This is your captain speaking.
You will be flying at an altitude of Sam.
Bye-bye, Mr Bates.
Oh, sweetheart.
Aren't you proud of our daughter?
If it hadn't been for her, Irving and Ruthie would never have had the chance to be as happy as we are.
This is happy?
What would you call it?
Happy!
Happy!
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
- Darrin?
- I'm on the phone.
Larry, I've gotta go.
And the next time you have such good news, can it wait till I get to the office?
Goodbye.
Haven't you got time for breakfast?
- No, I'm late already.
I'd better go.
- What'd Larry want?
Oh, some college kid who's thinking about a career in advertising is coming to the office to observe.
As if I don't have enough of a workload, guess who Larry's assigned the kid to.
Why did he have to call you at home to tell you that?
He figures if I'm gonna get mad, do it on my own time.
I think it's very decent of Larry to show an interest in a young college person.
Yeah.
Especially one whose father happens to be an important client.
I'd better get going.
Take good care of that college girl.
Did I say it was a girl?
No, but you didn't say it was a he, so I figured it must be a she.
Bye.
Samantha, blind faith is unbecoming to you.
Mother, eavesdropping is unbecoming to you.
Don't you care that Dum-Dum is the prey of some college cutie?
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye, sucker.
Now, Mother.
No mortal pulls the wool over a witch's eyes while I'm around.
Mother, I want you to promise to butt out.
Very well, very well.
I promise.
Witch's honour.
- Really, Samantha.
I hardly think - Mother!
Witch's honour.
Thank you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna give Adam his bath.
- Serena!
- Hi, Auntie!
What's going down?
Little cousin got a problem?
Not yet, but I'm working on it.
How are you at love spells?
To be perfectly frank, terrific!
In that case, Serena, how would you like to have some fun with Dum-Dum?
Endora, why me?
Because I promised not to butt in.
You know I hate to be pushy.
So you butt in.
- Endora, you're positively evil.
- I know.
Isn't it divine?
Mr Stephens, Miss Harrison is here.
Show her in.
Thank you.
How do you do?
I'm Dusty Harrison.
Well, I'm Darrin Stephens.
Nice to meet you.
- Please sit down.
- Thank you.
Yes, I certainly do appreciate you taking the time to orient me to the world of advertising.
It's my pleasure.
I don't know just how we're gonna proceed, but Well, I think the most practical method would be for you to do whatever it is you do and pay no attention to me.
Yes, well, I have a storyboard to check over.
You might like to look at that.
Yes, yes, I think I might.
I'm rather proud of this one.
It's for a TV commercial.
The product is Hilgreen coffee, and the hero is a cranky coffeepot.
But this morning, the lady of the house puts a new coffee in the pot.
Now he begins to smile, and now he's chuckling, and then we see it's Hilgreen coffee.
- Well, what do you think of it?
- Well And now, no sidestepping, now.
I want your honest opinion.
Okay, it's childish.
No, no, be honest.
What do you mean, childish?
It implies that you can get happiness in a can of coffee when it doesn't say anything about the quality of the coffee.
Have you ever tasted this coffee?
That is not our problem.
Well, maybe that's what's wrong with the world of advertising.
Miss Harrison, I hardly think that Go ahead.
Put the spell on her.
I still don't see why I have to do your dirty work.
Because when I make a promise not to interfere, I never interfere.
But that doesn't mean you can't interfere.
So start interfering.
Let this chick by love be dazed when on this mortal she doth gaze.
you're in a position to criticise.
And, furthermore What is it?
Is something wrong?
Oh, no.
Far from it.
What are you smiling about?
I don't know.
I guess your enthusiasm is contagious.
Anything wrong with being contagious?
Enthusiastic?
Of course not.
I think it's beautiful.
Isn't it funny?
When I first came in here I thought, "Wow, this is gonna be a drag".
You did?
- But you have such a wonderful manner.
- I do?
I know this is going to be a marvellous experience, Darrin.
Yes, it is, Dusty.
- Let's go.
- No!
I wanna stick around and see how it comes out.
If you don't know that, you're not much of a witch.
Well, I'd better get on with my work.
Is there anything I can do?
Not really.
Well, I'd love to help.
Well, as a matter of fact, those pencils need sharpening.
There's a sharpener on the drafting table.
Yes, sir, Darrin.
I've got another idea.
How would you like to go on an errand for me?
Oh, I'd love to.
Especially if you come with me.
I think you can handle this by yourself.
Nice.
Nice and sharp.
You were right.
This coffeepot is all wrong.
- It doesn't have any character.
- It doesn't?
I want you to go shopping and see if you can find a coffeepot that knows its own mind.
An aggressive, clear-thinking coffeepot.
Right.
I'll do it as fast as I can and be right back.
No, no, no.
Take your time.
Buy a half a dozen if you have to.
Comb the city, but take all the time you need.
I really appreciate your confidence.
And I won't fail you, Darrin.
- Sam?
- In here, sweetheart.
- Hi.
- Hi, honey.
- How was your day?
- Well, it wasn't a bad day.
It wasn't a good day.
As a matter of fact, it wasn't a bad day.
That bad, huh?
What happened?
The client's daughter happened.
What's she like?
She's just your average know-it-all college girl.
A little on the plain side.
Studious, dedicated, you know.
Yes.
I'll get it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
You must be Mrs Stephens.
I'm Dusty.
You don't look it.
Yes, I'm Mrs Stephens.
Come on in.
- I'll get Mr Stephens.
- Thank you.
It's your average know-it-all college kid.
A little on the plain side.
Dedicated, studious, wearing a miniskirt and a great big smile.
- Hi.
- Well, hi.
- You've changed.
- I usually do when I'm going out.
Your coffeepots.
I brought them by the office, but you had gone.
And you said it was crucial, so I thought you should have them as soon as possible.
Well, thanks.
You shouldn't have bothered.
I was glad to do it, Darrin.
Well, can I fix you something?
Coffee?
Ginger ale?
Root beer?
When you get to martini, stop.
A martini, huh?
Well, come on in.
- Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.
Sam, suppose you could fix some cheese and crackers or a snack or something like that?
How about giving me a quarter?
I'll go to the movies.
You must think it's terrible of me barging in this way.
But it's really been an inspiration working with Darrin.
You don't mind if I call him Darrin, do you?
Of course not.
He's been called worse than that.
That's great.
A wife with a sense of humour.
Yes, we laugh a lot around here.
- Here you are.
- Thanks.
You know what I think is amazing, Darrin?
That you've gotten as far as you have at your age.
Actually, I'm not that young.
Although I guess most men in my position are much older.
Nuts?
No, thanks.
I hope one of those coffeepots will do the trick.
I'm just dying to have you look at my coffeepots.
I'm sure he's dying to see them.
That's very sweet of you.
That must be my roast.
I'd better be going now.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Yes, until tomorrow.
- It's been wonderful meeting you.
- It's been nice meeting you, too.
I just hope I found a clear-thinking, aggressive coffeepot for you.
Sweetheart, don't you think it would have been nice if you'd asked Dusty to stay for dinner?
I'll admit, she looked hungry.
Come on, Sam.
She's just a very naive kid.
But she certainly does have enthusiasm.
And it's very well-distributed.
Darrin, how come you didn't mention the fact that she obviously has a violent crush on you?
- You really think so?
- Yes, I really think so.
Maybe I could talk Larry into assigning Dusty to someone else.
Don't be ridiculous.
You're right.
Do you think that silly little girl could make me forget you for one moment?
Well, for one moment, maybe.
- I'll talk to Larry in the morning.
- Good idea.
Actually, I felt this would be better coming from Mr Tate, but, well, he didn't agree.
- Miss Harrison - You promised to call me Dusty.
Okay, Dusty.
Well, here it is in a nutshell.
You're so decisive.
You come right to the point.
Yes?
Well, it's simply this.
I feel it would be better if you were assigned to one of the other men.
You mean you don't want me around?
No, no, it's not that.
It's just that I think it would be safer.
I mean, wiser.
Oh, please, no, don't do that.
Now, now, now, look.
This isn't very mature, you know.
Please try to understand, Dusty.
I'm only doing this for your own good.
After all, you came here to learn something, didn't you?
And then Dusty ran hysterically home and cried her heart out to her father, who obviously thinks I've led her on.
Now I'm public enemy number one with Larry and Harrison.
If I didn't know better, I'd say there was a spell on Dusty.
Gee, thanks a lot.
What do you mean, if you didn't know better?
Mother gave her witch's honour she wouldn't interfere.
Her witch's what?
Her witch's honour.
And she wouldn't dare break it.
Of course, there is the possibility she got someone else to cast that spell.
But who?
Who else?
My cousin, the love goddess.
Some love goddess.
You know what I'd better do?
Call Harrison and straighten things out with him.
I'll get his number from the office.
Serena.
Serena.
Serena, I wanna talk to you right this second.
Go pollinate something.
"Am on cloud nine.
Can't come right now.
Serena".
Serena, you're not gonna get away with it that easily.
- Darrin?
- Yeah?
Do you mind if I go out for a little while?
Esmeralda's upstairs with the kids.
I won't be long.
Okay.
You see what's happened to your cousin as a result of living in the mortal world?
She's getting to be almost as dumb as he is.
Now do your thing.
Very good, Samantha.
Thank you, Mums.
- Darrin?
- Yeah?
- I thought you left.
- I changed my mind.
You know, it just occurred to me.
Instead of talking to Harrison on the phone, why not invite him to drop over?
- You mean here?
- Well, sure.
That way he can see how much in love and how happily married we are.
Samantha, that's a terrific idea.
And the way he's building up a head of steam, the sooner the better.
I'll ask him to come over as soon as possible.
Mr Harrison, I really appreciate your coming over.
I know it's an imposition, but I have my reasons for wanting to talk to you here.
Let's get on with it.
Well, of course.
Please come in.
I want you to meet my wife.
This is my wife, Samantha.
Mr Harrison.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Please sit down.
- Okay.
You got something to say, let's hear it.
I've got quite a few things to say to you.
Okay.
Mr Harrison, look around here.
What do you see?
A very nice home and a very lovely wife.
Thank you.
Exactly.
Which should prove to you that I'm a happily married man and very much in love.
And I swear to you, I have not given your daughter one bit of encouragement.
I can't swallow that.
Dusty's always been a very level-headed girl.
And yet you expect me to believe that she could fall in love with a married man that she's known for little over a day without any encouragement.
I suppose that sounds fishy to you, but - It sounds a little fishy to me, too.
- What?
I mean, from Mr Harrison's point of view.
Samantha, would you just sit there and listen?
Certainly, sweetheart.
Now then Would this bother you, Mrs Stephens?
Not in the least.
Excuse me.
I'll get it.
May I?
I just love the smell of a good cigar.
Yes, it's a panatela.
Care for one?
Don't pretend he isn't here because I know he is.
Daddy, I couldn't believe it when your office told me where you'd gone.
Why are you trying to humiliate me?
Dusty, just take it easy and relax.
When are you going to stop treating me like a child?
When you start acting like an adult.
I'm trying to act like an adult, but you won't let me.
- I think I'd better take you home.
- No.
I wanna have this out.
- Stop it, Dusty.
- Yeah, will you stop it?
I don't care.
I love him.
He's already married, you silly little nincompoop.
That's right, I'm married, you nincompoop.
- You called me a nincompoop.
- Yeah, but so did your father.
Oh, Dusty.
You ought to let me take you home, honey.
If you don't stay out of this, I'm never going to speak to you again.
Please stop that, Dusty.
Will you cut that out?
I tell you, Mrs Stephens, I don't even know how to apologise.
- That's okay.
I'm used to it.
- You mean Why don't you walk me out on the patio and I'll fill you in?
But we won't be able to keep an eye on them.
And they won't be able to keep an eye on us.
Get it?
- Now just calm down, Dusty.
- Why are you so mean to me?
Dusty, you've got to get over me.
I am not available.
If your wife cares so much for you, then why is she out on the patio with my father?
Well, I don't know.
I still think we ought to go inside and see what's happening.
Forget about them.
Let's talk about us.
Well, I still think It figures.
Mother got you to do her dirty work.
Cool it, Cuz.
We only did it for you.
Mortal men being what they are, we thought a simple spell, a certain test of infidelity was in order.
I don't have to put Darrin through any test.
And if you don't remove that spell, Cousin, you are going to be an ex-cousin.
I guess you just don't know what it's like to be in love with somebody - who doesn't even care for you.
- That's not true!
- Darrin, are you hurt?
Are you all right?
- No, I'm fine.
Okay, okay, but you're making a national case out of nothing.
That's a federal case and hurry up.
I'm fine.
Now just calm down.
I'm fine.
Spoilsport.
ought to go in.
- You animal!
- What are you doing?
Take your hands off her, Stephens!
I have had enough of this whole silly farce!
And I've had enough of your pawing.
And I've heard enough of your explanations, you phoney.
- Well, just what are you gonna do about it?
- I ought to bust you right in the bazoo.
You and who else?
Well, had enough?
Try one here.
What'd you do to my father, you brute?
- Nothing.
I - I have a good mind to slap your face.
Well, if it'll make you feel any better, be my guest.
- Come along, Father.
- Gladly.
This place is crazy.
And don't forget, you owe me for five coffeepots.
Why did you let her hit me?
After all she'd been through, I felt it was the least I could do for her.
Well?
It still hurts.
Light to heavy snow covered most of the Eastern Seaboard today.
And storm warnings are up from Cape Hatteras to the Gulf Coast.
The low for the day was recorded at Rocky Point, Montana, with a temperature of 20 degrees below zero.
You didn't even touch your lamb chops.
It's a little hard to eat when the roof's about to fall in.
Maybe Harrison will change his mind about cancelling his account.
- Do you really believe that?
- No.
But I hate to see those chops go to waste.
I don't know what I'm going to tell Larry, if he's still speaking to me.
If he isn't, you don't have to tell him anything.
Sam, listen.
He is 52-year-old John J. Harrison, head of Harrison Industries, who was charged with embezzlement and three counts of fraud.
- Is that the same Harrison?
- Of course.
professors is meeting with presidential advisors to discuss matters relating to the academic I knew it all the time.
I knew he was in trouble.
I had a feeling in my bones.
That's why I drove him to the point where he pulled his account.
Boy, are we lucky we're not associated with him any more.
Darrin If I do say so myself, my timing was beautiful.
- Darrin, do you really believe any of that?
- No.
Then why are you saying it?
I'm just rehearsing what I'm going to tell Larry.
- How does it sound?
- Ridiculous.
Well, there's no other earthly explanation, is there?
No, you're right.
There is no other earthly explanation.
You sly dog.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
- Mommy.
- Yes, sweetheart?
Is this dollhouse for me?
Oh, honey, it isn't a dollhouse.
It's part of Daddy's work.
It looks like a dollhouse.
Well, when miniature houses are used in business, they're called models.
Daddy's doing the advertising for a new housing development.
I can make it bigger.
Never mind.
The builders will make it bigger.
I'll show you how it works.
Now, you see, if you want a larger living room and a smaller dining room, you take this wall and move it there.
Witches can do that.
Looks like the mortals are catching up with us, huh?
Now, upstairs, as the family grows, you take this wall and put it here and you have two bedrooms instead of one.
Are you sure Daddy won't give it to me?
I'm afraid not, sweetheart.
He needs it for his work.
- Then can I go upstairs and play?
- Sure.
Sam, will you help me get this out to the car?
Oh, certainly.
- It's stuck.
- Let me try it.
- The lock is jammed.
- Well, you can go out the side door.
Let's put this down over here.
- That's strange.
I wonder if somebody - lf somebody what?
Let's try the kitchen door.
- This door won't open either.
- I wonder if somebody what?
Sam, what's going on?
I don't know, but something.
Because three doors at the same time can't be a coincidence.
It's too coincidental.
Okay, who's the wise witch?
It could be any one of your practical-joking relatives.
And while you try and figure it out, I think I'll climb out the window.
This is great.
I'm due at a meeting to deliver my advertising campaign in exactly 45 minutes.
Inconvenient, huh?
So will you give me a hammer, and I'll break the window?
- I'll call Mother.
It's cheaper.
- My way is faster.
Sam, this is ridiculous.
Well, at least you proved there's nothing wrong with the hammer.
This is no time for levity.
I've got to get out of here.
Yes, sweetheart.
Well, why don't I just pop you outside?
- Sam, you know I don't tolerate witchcraft.
- Okay.
Start popping.
Wait a minute.
Let me try again.
- You've lost your powers?
- I'll check.
No.
Just my popper power.
But don't panic, not until I try an emergency incantation.
Wooden doors, don't get the best of me.
When I command you, open sestame.
That's an incantation?
You were in a hurry.
I don't have time for poetry.
Terrific.
We're trapped.
- Darrin.
- What?
Now you can panic.
Darrin, I have tried every exit in the house and they are all un-exitable.
Did you talk to Tabitha?
Oh, sweetheart, this is big witch stuff, not little witch stuff.
- How long till your meeting?
- Thirty-eight minutes.
Darrin.
Darrin, I love you very much.
What does that have to do with it?
Nothing.
I just like to say that in a crisis so you won't get mad at me.
Why would I get mad at you?
Well, I am a witch, and there's a chance that this is all related to witchcraft.
There's a chance?
There's a good chance.
- A good chance?
- Darrin, don't be sarcastic.
What would you like me to be?
Patient and understanding, while I consult an expert.
Mother?
Mother?
Good morning, Samantha.
- Durwood, why aren't you working?
- I'm lazy.
Mother, Darrin isn't working because he can't get out of the house and neither can I. None of our doors or windows will open.
Really?
- What an original spell.
- By whom?
By someone who disapproves of your marriage and wants to make trouble for it.
Exactly.
Now remove the spell, Mother.
My dear, I didn't cast the spell.
- Witch's honour?
- Witch's honour.
Well, then, who did?
Who likes to play stupid practical jokes?
- Uncle Arthur.
- Uncle Arthur.
Two great minds with but a single thought.
Mother, now, I can't pop out, so why don't you see if you can track down Uncle Arthur for us?
For us, no.
For you, yes.
Now, that's strange.
- Why don't you try an incantation?
- Perhaps that's what's needed.
To rescue my daughter who married a buffoon, up, up and away in my beautiful balloon.
How about that?
You have an unexpected houseguest.
Peachy.
Well, I guess I'll just have to get Uncle Arthur to come here to us.
- Uncle - What's the matter?
Well, if Uncle Arthur pops in here and it turns out not to be his spell, he won't be able to pop out.
You're right.
Don't risk it.
It's bad enough being stuck here with your mother.
Darwin, you apologise or I'll blast you into lunar orbit.
You can't.
We're all stuck here together.
- Well, I could fly him around the house a bit.
- Mother.
Or I could make him invisible.
That way I wouldn't have to look at him.
- Mother, stop kidding around.
- Who's kidding?
- Hello?
- Hello, Samantha.
This is Larry.
It's Larry.
Hi, Larry.
What's new?
What's new is where is Darrin?
He's due here for an important meeting.
Well, Larry, I was just about to call you.
Darrin's stuck.
What do you mean, he's stuck?
That's the wrong word.
He's stricken with illness.
Well, we don't know yet.
The doctor's examining him now.
I hope it's nothing serious.
But if it is, will you please call me back right away, Sam?
Then I'll try to postpone the meeting for an hour or so.
- Larry!
- Just joking.
- I'll call you later.
- All right, Larry.
Bye-bye.
- Well, was he furious?
- No.
No, of course not.
He places your health above everything, practically.
This will be very cosy.
A few short hours, days, weeks, months, years in the bosom of my family.
Mother, I wish we could share your enthusiasm In constant companionship with those I love, my daughter, my granddaughter, my grandson and Well, you can't have everything.
Mother, we have to come up with some other possibilities besides Uncle Arthur.
Be patient, Samantha.
The culprit will reveal himself when he's good and ready, and not before.
Durwood, sit down and relax.
The centuries will pass quickly.
Darrin, where are you?
- I'm in here.
- Where's "in here"?
I was trying to climb up the chimney.
Sweetheart, you know there's not enough room for you to climb up that chimney.
Of course I know that.
But I'm slowly losing my grip on my sanity.
May I have your handkerchief?
- Darrin, I love you very much.
- You already said that.
I'm repeating it for emphasis.
I love you too, honey, but there is a limit to my endurance.
Do you know what our marriage is like?
Old MacDonald's farm.
Here a spell, there a spell, everywhere a spell-spell.
What's your answer to that?
Ee-eye, ee-eye, oh?
I'll bet that's Larry again.
What shall I tell him?
Tell him I love him very much.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
Nice to hear from you.
- How's Darrin?
- His condition is unchanged.
But what did the doctor say?
The doctor said He said we should consult a specialist.
There he is now.
I'll call you when I know something definite.
Bye-bye.
My compliments to your soundman.
I was playing with my grandchildren, and in my objective opinion, they're both brilliant.
From their mother's side.
What's that?
It's a model of a unique house designed by one of Darrin's clients.
It has moveable walls.
Big deal.
I've been thinking.
You know whose spell this might be?
Esmeralda's.
When she baby-sat two nights ago, maybe she tried something or other and it backfired.
Shall I yoo-hoo for her?
I'm so anxious to get out of here, I'm even reconsidering your calling Uncle Arthur.
Besides, the more, the merrier.
Yoo-hoo, Esmeralda!
Yes, Samantha?
Mr Stephens!
I assumed you would be at your office.
So did I. Excuse me, Mother.
Esmeralda, we have a problem.
When you baby-sat two nights ago, did you cast any spells?
No, I didn't.
Mr Stephens, I must apologise for letting you see me this way, but I have a date tonight and I was just giving myself a beauty treatment.
Endora, guess who finally asked me out.
- Cary Grant.
- No.
Ulysses Grant?
No.
Ramon Verona.
Ramon Verona?
Have you ever been to the Interplanetary Playboy Club?
Frequently.
Is he a member?
He's the salad chef.
I've had my eye on him for 75 years, and this is the first time he ever gave me a tumble.
Esmeralda, why don't you sit down?
We have some news for you.
Good news or bad news?
Good and bad.
The bad news is that you won't be able to keep your date tonight because you're a prisoner.
Well, what's the good news?
The good news is I love you very much.
Endora, now what have you done?
Since Tabitha can't play outside, I've given her things to play with inside.
- We haven't got room, so get rid of them.
- Get rid of them?
Where?
- What's this for?
- For my granddaughter.
Mother, you have a lot to learn about being a houseguest.
That's Larry.
Make him go away, but don't offend him.
I won't.
I'll be nice and friendly and tell him the house is sealed off by witchcraft.
Okay, offend him.
- Who is it?
- Sam, it's me, Larry.
Oh, hi, Larry.
What can I do for you?
You can open the door and let me in.
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you'll have to stay outside.
Why?
The specialist said Darrin was contagious.
Contagious?
With what?
With a contagious disease.
Okay.
But would you mind getting me the model?
I need it for the meeting.
I couldn't do that, Larry.
- Why not?
- We're under quarantine.
Darrin's germs are all over that house.
Sam, will you please open the door so we don't have to shout at each other?
Shouting is good exercise!
- Sam, I smell something fishy.
- Oh, that must be our lunch.
We're having broiled salmon, have to turn it over!
Bye, Larry!
Love to Louise!
Sam!
Sam, come back!
- Tabitha, look at that.
- Oh, boy!
Will you push me on the swings, Grandmamma?
Certainly, darling.
Sit down.
Well, has anyone come up with an idea about how I can keep my date with Ramon Verona?
Esmeralda, Ramon Verona is the least of our worries.
Mr Stephens, you wouldn't say that if you were an unmarried witch - who seldom gets a shot at romance.
- Esmeralda.
I am surprised at your lack of sensitivity.
Esmeralda, would you take Tabitha upstairs while I try to consult Dr Bombay?
Come along, Tabitha.
Come along.
I may only be a maid, but I still have feelings.
Samantha, why consult Bombay?
Who's sick?
I am.
I have a contagious disease.
It's about to change me into a raving maniac.
The change will be imperceptible.
Mother, now, looking at it broadly, this house is sick.
So maybe a house call can cure it.
Logical?
No, but call him anyway.
Paging Dr Bombay.
Paging Dr Bombay.
Emergency.
Come right away.
I've been having a bull session with my nurse.
Where's your red cape?
I dropped it making a pass at her.
Dr Bombay, we have a peculiar problem.
I know, but he's easy to get rid of, isn't he?
Today, nothing is easy to get rid of.
Anyone or anything who's here stays here.
None of our doors or windows will open.
Diagnose that, bull artist.
The diagnosis, bigmouth, and others, is elementary.
It's a vapour lock.
I thought that only happened to automobiles.
Ignorant, isn't he?
I'll run a spot check with my atmospheric oscillator.
No home should be without one.
Just as I suspected, 80 over 60.
- Is that bad?
- It's terrible.
Normal is three over four-fifths.
Maybe you're holding it too close to Durwood.
Durwood is entirely irrelevant.
- I'll buy that.
- It's not for sale.
I'm in favour of relieving the suspense with a little humour.
So am I. Why don't you try some?
- Darrin, that's no way to speak to a doctor.
- Especially a witch doctor.
I wish you wouldn't call him that.
Please continue, Dr Bombay.
Just as you wish.
It's definitely a vapour lock.
Would you mind refreshing our memory on what that is?
I'll try.
Where most witches live, the art of witchcraft is practised continually.
But when you married a mortal, your use of witchcraft was sharply curtailed.
- Who said so?
- Darrin, don't interrupt.
This atrophy of action causes the undistributed metaphysical particles to clutter up the atmospheric continuum, thereby creating a bilateral transcendental trauma.
Or, in layman's terms, a vapour lock.
Why didn't I think of that?
Dr Bombay, now that you know the cause, do you have a cure?
I can answer your question in three parts.
A, I can cure it with a simple incantation.
B, I can't cure it because the incantation must be done from the outside and I can't get there because we are vapour-locked.
And C, because I'm anxious to get back to my nurse, I have an idea that will allow you to slide me under the door.
Aren't you a little bulky for that?
You merely transfer me to a flat surface such as a photograph and slide me under the door.
- And then I can redimensionalize you.
- Precisely.
Why didn't I think of that?
Go ahead, Samantha, photograph me.
Just a second.
This is my best side.
- Say cheese.
- Cheese.
- How'd it turn out?
- Horrible.
It looks just like him.
To make this house again conventional, let Dr Bombay be three-dimensional.
Heed my solution to air pollution, obey the doc, vanish vapour lock.
There went a great doctor.
Anything else?
Potions, magic amulets, flu shots?
Nothing, Doctor.
Just thank you very much.
Don't thank me, my dear.
Just thank modern medicine.
The field is clear for takeoff.
Which I hope you do just as soon as you turn this playground back into a living room.
- He's not much of a father, is he?
- Mother, wait a minute.
Darrin, I have an idea.
Instead of popping this out, why not shrink it to fit the model home?
- What for?
- Well, if they can make interior walls move, maybe they can make the roof move, too, and create an indoor-outdoor play yard.
I don't follow you.
Mother, would you shrink the equipment?
And put it where the backyard would be.
I'll demonstrate.
They could make a sliding roof.
When the weather's bad, children can play outside under the shelter.
Just like Tabitha couldn't go out to play today, other children can't get out when the weather's bad.
That's not a bad idea.
Not bad?
It's brilliant.
It might be, at that.
I could tell Larry the reason I was late is that I was stalling until the miniature playground equipment got here.
I'd better go.
- Endora?
- Yes?
I never thought I'd say this, but you've been a big help.
Samantha, what would your husband do without us?
I don't know, but let's not ever let him find out.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
How'd it go?
Well, I had a very shaky beginning.
Now, I told Larry your idea about the indoor-outdoor play yard and he hated it.
But he agreed to let me mention it to the client at the meeting and the client loved it.
- And now Larry loves it, too.
- Right.
Congratulations.
And I owe it all to you.
Even my idea about how to advertise it.
"For those days when you can't get out of the house".
- Samantha, will you help me?
- What's the matter?
I'm supposed to meet Ramon Verona for dining and dancing on Jupiter, but there's something wrong with my radar.
Esmeralda, a gentleman warlock is supposed to call for a witch in person.
Ramon is no gentleman.
That's why I'm so anxious to go out with him.
I've landed on Mars and Venus and Pluto, but I just can't seem to hit Jupiter.
- Jupiter's a toughie.
- Will you send me?
I'd be happy to.
Special delivery.
Happy landing.
Well, sweetheart, I not only helped Esmeralda, I helped us, too.
How?
I distributed metaphysical particles to avoid another vapour lock.
Sweetheart, maybe I should make a point of using my witchcraft once a day.
- Once a day?
- Once every two days?
Once a week?
Once in a while?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Okay, who's the wise witch?
Wiser than you are, cousin, drudging around the kitchen like a slave.
Serena, doing housework is one of the joys of living the mortal life.
It means you're doing something for someone you love.
Well, you didn't develop biceps doing it.
Instead, why don't you break out and join me and the Maharaja of Jodhpur?
He's throwing an elephant race.
Well, I appreciate the thought, but I have a day you wouldn't believe.
I have to take Adam to the paediatrician, get Tabitha some new shoes, pick up a dress to wear to a business dinner at the Tates' tonight And tote that barge and lift that bale.
That's on tomorrow's list.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Mrs Corby.
Mrs Stephens.
I'm surprised to find you at home.
You were supposed to be here Oh, but there must be some mistake.
I thought it was tomorrow at 11:00.
No.
I have you down here for today, and I'm counting on you.
Well, yes, Mrs Corby, but I can cover for you for a while.
How long will it take you to get here?
About 20 minutes.
I'm sorry, and I'll be there as soon as I can.
Serena, have I ever asked you to do me any favours?
Yes.
You've asked me to get lost often enough.
Oh, Serena, this is for such a good cause.
For sending underprivileged kids to summer camp.
Yes, but All you'd have to do is take my place in the lobby of the Huntington Hotel, selling chances to people passing by.
It's really very simple.
Even you could do it.
Somehow, I don't think I'm being flattered.
Oh, well, on second thought, forget it.
Darrin would have a fit!
I'll do it!
Just one more thing.
Would you make that skirt just a smidgen longer?
Killjoy!
That's better.
While I was waiting for you, Mrs Stephens, I sold another $14 worth of tickets.
Oh, well, I only hope I can do as well as you did.
Now you're using good common sense.
Listen, Larry, you know as well as I do, your company has done a great job over the years for Dinsdale Soups, but let's face it, we've got to close up that generation gap.
Now when am I going to meet this young, bright genius who's going to turn the trick?
Tonight at my house, along with some other members of my staff.
- Hi, there!
- Hi.
Would you be interested in sending a boy to camp and making a girl happy?
Yeah.
See you tonight.
- How about you, sir?
- Huh?
What?
How about me for what?
- Send a boy to camp?
- Oh, sorry.
All of my charitable contributions are made through the George Dinsdale Foundation.
Oh?
Who's George Dinsdale?
Silly girl.
Me.
But if you'd like to have a drink with me, I might consider some out-of-pocket charity.
What do you say?
Depends.
How much have you got in your pocket?
Well, let's see.
Two fives and three dimes and a cough drop.
I'll take the cough drop.
I just got a chill.
Oh, my hunch was right.
You are something else.
You have no idea.
- Do you know what I'm going to do for you?
- What?
I'm going to buy all of your tickets up.
Groovy.
There's something about a first meeting that has its own special excitement.
It's like the start of a big game hunt.
- Don't tell me you're a hunter, too?
- No, no, no.
I confine my safaris to the jungles of New York, Paris and London.
And may I say, you are the wildest game I have ever hunted.
Careful.
Maybe you're the chicken, and I'm the hawk.
Well, you do have beautiful hands.
Thank you.
And the longest lifeline I've ever seen.
It runs in the family.
I see something else.
I see lunch tomorrow at this table.
Look harder and you'll see dinner tonight at your place.
I have to go to a business dinner tonight, unfortunately.
Well, if you got to go, you got to go.
Would you consider coming with me?
If you think that's my kind of evening, I'm a little disappointed.
You're right.
Lost my head.
- Lunch tomorrow.
Where do I pick you up?
- Right here.
- Ciao.
- Ciao.
- I'm so glad you could come.
- Thank you.
There you go, George.
Very cold, very dry with a twist of lime instead of lemon.
- You know, I've got to try that sometime.
- Thanks, Larry.
- Where's this wonder boy of yours?
- Oh, he's got to be here any minute.
- Oh, hi, dear.
- Hello, Louise.
I'm sorry we're late.
- Let me take your coat.
- Look at that.
Groovy.
Listen, you'd better go right on in.
They're waiting for you.
Here he is, George.
The late Darrin Stephens.
Great pleasure, Mr Dinsdale.
- And the charming Mrs Stephens.
- How do you do?
Hello.
Two ice-cold martinis coming right up.
I'm looking forward to our meeting tomorrow, Mr Dinsdale.
I'm very enthusiastic about some of the ideas I've worked up for Dinsdale Soups.
- I think you're going to like what I have.
- Oh, I already do.
Pardon?
I mean, I appreciate your enthusiasm, Stephens.
Darrin, I'm sure you know your way back to the bar better than I do.
- I wonder - Oh, sure.
I like it stirred slowly, at least 50 turns in the pitcher.
I see we have the same taste in martinis.
Excuse me.
- As well as beautiful women.
- Well, thank you very much.
How come the 50 turns in the pitcher?
It gives us more time.
- For what?
- For what?
And you thought this was going to be a dull party.
- I did?
- So did I. How could I know about this?
- About what?
- Well, what else?
You and me.
I tell you.
Fate must be dealing those cards to us.
It's kismet.
The gods have ordained it.
- You know what I mean?
- Yes.
Yes, I know exactly what you mean, and I suggest you put it right out of your mind.
Oh, you mean until tomorrow?
Mr Dinsdale, you are labouring under a misapprehension.
Now if I may make a carefully considered suggestion.
Sure.
Knock it off!
I love it.
I love it!
When those sparks fly from your eyes.
You know, you're even more striking now than you were this afternoon.
I think we'd better go back and join the others before - This afternoon?
- Of course.
What are you worrying about?
Nobody can hear us.
At the Huntington Hotel?
A name that will be etched in my memory forever.
Oh, Mr Dinsdale, I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
- What for?
I loved it.
- No, you didn't.
I mean, no.
No, you didn't meet me.
Well, I mean, you met me, but it wasn't me you met.
Keep talking.
You're beautiful.
The way you look Will you listen?
Now, my cousin Serena took my place at the hotel this afternoon to sell those raffle tickets.
We look a great deal alike, and sometimes Oh, dear.
Well, it's much too complicated to explain right now.
It's all right.
I get it.
Oh, the games that people play.
Listen, Serena, when you arrive at the lunchroom tomorrow, just ask for 007.
- I'm telling you.
I'm not Serena!
- Oh, sure, I understand.
And I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention anything about this to Darrin.
Are you kidding?
He's the last one that's supposed to know.
Just be there at the luncheon date.
Your date is with Serena.
Serena, Samantha.
"A rose by any other name" Just tell your cousin to be there.
Oh, I definitely will.
Serena?
Serena!
Serena?
Boy, do you have rotten timing.
What can I do for you, Cuz?
- For one thing, you can stop being me.
- What are you talking about?
Don't play innocent with me.
Innocence is not my bag.
I am talking about a certain George Dinsdale.
Oh, him.
Yes, him.
He happens to be a client of McMann & Tate, and he tried to nuzzle my ear at dinner tonight!
Well, that is a bit of a sticky wicket.
Funny, huh?
Not to me.
I gather you're having lunch with him tomorrow, so I want you to straighten him out.
I don't know why you're so uptight.
It's perfectly innocent.
He's very good-looking, and I happen to turn him on.
Well, turn him off!
Okay!
Okay.
Don't bust your broom.
Hi, there.
Hi, there.
Forgive me.
I'm terrible with names.
The password is "Send a boy to camp".
Samantha!
That wig is terrific.
I didn't recognise you.
Sit down.
Sit down.
I was beginning to think you'd chickened out.
I took the liberty of ordering.
George, there's something I have to tell you.
- I can't get over that wig.
- That's what I have to tell you.
It isn't a wig.
Yesterday, that was a wig.
Well, who cares?
Let's not waste time on small talk.
Oh, Samantha, I want to know everything about you.
Well, the first thing you must know is that I am not Samantha.
I'm her cousin Serena.
Oh, sure, sure.
Very wise, too.
You're Samantha in suburbia and Serena when you're out on the town.
- You devil, you.
A bit overcautious, but - No, no.
No.
Samantha was in a spot yesterday, so I took her place to sell those raffle tickets.
I tell you I am Serena.
Okay, okay.
So you're Serena.
Just as long as I've made that perfectly clear.
Perfectly.
Now, there's something I've got to know before we go any further.
What?
- What about Darrin?
- What about him?
Well, you know.
How do you feel about him?
- Oh, well, he's all right.
- What does that mean?
Well, he's okay to visit, but I wouldn't want to live with him.
That's just what I figured.
Oh, believe me, I would love to stay and play, but I have to fly.
- So if you'll excuse me.
- Well, wait.
What about lunch?
Besides, we haven't begun to talk about me.
Sure we have.
In fact, we just finished.
Oh, Samantha, stay and at least have one more drink.
Oh, waiter?
Waiter?
Another round for me and the young lady.
- Young lady?
- Yes If I may suggest, sir, maybe you should have something to eat.
Oh, hi, Larry.
I'm glad you dropped in.
I wanted to show you this.
It's a new label I'm thinking of springing on Dinsdale.
- Forget it.
He just called.
- And?
- He doesn't want you on the account.
- What?
And from the way he talked, I'd say he was thinking of cancelling his account altogether.
But why?
That's the same question that's been going through my mind.
- What'd you say to him last night?
- Nothing.
I mean, I said I was looking forward to working with him, and I was confident he was going to like my ideas.
- What else?
- Oh, I don't know.
I made him a martini.
- Did you use gin?
- Of course.
- Did you chill the glass?
- Yes.
Did you put a twist of lime in it?
- No.
- Well, that's it.
He didn't like the martini.
- Larry, you're not making sense.
- I know, but I'm desperate.
- Oh, Mr Dinsdale.
- You're a naughty girl.
I am?
I didn't think you were the type that got cold feet.
Well, I don't, not even in the coldest weather.
- May I come in?
- Of course.
Serena did show up at the luncheon, didn't she?
Oh, of course.
And she did clear up the misunderstanding?
Oh, look, I'm tired of playing these kind of games.
Oh, well, so am I, especially without a referee.
Please!
Mr Dinsdale, what went on at that lunch?
Oh, Samantha, will you stop this charade?
Look, I know what's bugging you.
- You do?
- Of course I do.
And I Frankly, I agree.
The fact is, it's because your husband is still doing business with me, and I make it a rule never to do business with a man while I'm seeing his wife.
It puts me at a psychological disadvantage, if you know what I mean.
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.
Where were you when they were handing out character?
Oh, Samantha, let's be adult about this thing.
I have solved our problem.
I have fired Darrin off the account.
What?
And now that I've cleared the way for our happiness, how about showing a little gratitude?
Mr Dinsdale, in about two seconds, you are going to feel the full extent of my gratitude.
Now will you please let go and listen?
Oh, all right!
Okay.
Now, I'm going to try once more to clarify things.
I am Samantha.
You are Samantha.
I did not meet you at the hotel yesterday.
You did not meet me at the hotel yesterday.
- That was my cousin Serena.
- That was your cousin Serena.
Will you stop parroting me?
You're right.
Let's both stop talking.
Okay, you asked for it.
Hey, Sam?
Oh, hi, Larry, Darrin.
- Is Dinsdale here?
- What makes you think he's here?
He didn't show up for the meeting, and Betty told us he phoned for your address.
Where'd the parrot come from?
Oh, well, he belongs to a neighbour.
I was sort of parrot-sitting.
Hi, Darrin.
Isn't that cute?
I just taught him to say that.
Wow.
That usually takes months.
Well, he's a very apt pupil.
Maybe we ought to try Dinsdale's hotel again.
I'm Dinsdale.
I'm Dinsdale.
- You taught him that, too?
- Yes.
Well, I figured if Dinsdale ever dropped in I don't understand.
In case Dinsdale ever dropped in, you'd go and borrow the bird again?
You said it, I didn't.
Listen, if he can say Dinsdale's name, maybe we ought to buy the parrot, take him over to the hotel, go up to his room and spring it on him!
Well, I guess I'll go on home.
Let me know if you hear from Dinsdale.
I'm Dinsdale.
I'm Dinsdale.
Oh, shut up and eat your crackers.
See you, Sam.
Yeah.
Bye, Larry.
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
"Four score and seven years ago".
"Four score and seven years ago".
Fantastic!
I've never heard of a parrot that could learn that quickly.
Yes.
Well, there's a good explanation for that.
Oh?
Yes, it isn't a parrot.
You could've fooled me.
What is it?
It's a George Dinsdale.
You turned a client into a parrot?
I had to.
You see, he met Serena when she took my place at the hotel yesterday.
Then when he met me, he thought I was Serena.
You turned a client into a parrot?
Well, Darrin, he was all over me.
I had to do it.
Of course.
You had to do it.
- Poor guy.
- Well, what about poor me?
And what about poor you?
That bird had you fired!
That still doesn't justify doing a thing like this.
What if Larry had found out?
Well, he probably would have tried to get the parrot to sign on the dotted line.
Very funny.
Now, will you change him back?
Darrin, it's not going to do any good until we can convince him that there are two of us.
Now, you take him into the kitchen while I try and get hold of Serena.
Okay.
He doesn't seem to like me.
Well, it isn't a popularity contest.
Just get him out of the room.
Serena?
- Did you get in touch with Serena?
- Yes.
She's getting ready.
May I have a glass of water?
- Can't it wait till you change him back?
- It's not for me.
And Darrin, don't be surprised at anything I might say or do.
You're kidding.
Just have a few more sips and you'll feel better.
What happened?
Tell him what happened.
You felt a little faint and asked for some water.
Yeah, some water.
I must have had a lapse in memory.
I What am I doing in here?
Apparently, he doesn't remember about wanting the meeting changed.
No, no, he doesn't.
You wanted to meet here instead of at the office.
I did?
And I'm very glad we got that little matter straightened out about me and my cousin Serena.
Oh, now, that I remember.
As a matter of fact, she's here.
Come on.
Hi, Georgie Porgie!
I can't believe it!
There really are two of you.
I thought I'd never hear you say that.
I owe you a profound apology.
- It's perfectly all right.
- No, no, no.
It isn't, Mrs Stephens.
What can I do to make up for my grotesque behaviour?
Well, you could begin by apologising to Darrin.
Stephens, what can I say?
Well, what I'd like to hear you say is that you'll read the material I've prepared for you.
I don't have to.
Under the circumstances, I love it.
Love it!
And speaking of that, what are you doing in the immediate future?
I'm having dinner with you, followed, I imagine, by an evening of dancing, merrymaking and etcetera.
- What time shall I pick you up?
- Why wait?
What's wrong with starting the evening this afternoon?
Oh, lady, I like your style.
Again, forgive me.
Ta-ta, Cuz, Dumbo.
- Oh.
- Oh.
- May I come in?
- Yes, of course.
A little A little something to reinforce the apology.
Oh, well, thank you, but it really wasn't necessary.
- Well, good to see you, George.
- Oh, hi, Darrin.
I'd offer you a drink, but I have a hunch you wouldn't accept.
You'd make a great bookie.
I was wondering if you knew how to get in touch with Serena.
I owe her an apology.
Did something go wrong the other night?
Well, I must've had a bit too much to drink.
What happened?
Well, Serena and I were dancing, and the music was playing real soft.
Kind of prehistoric style, you know?
And I was singing in Serena's ear Fly me to the moon And then the next thing I knew, I was on my way!
Where?
- To the moon!
- Oh.
Oh, dear.
Well, that must've been quite a nightmare.
Oh, I tell you, I But I don't remember being asleep.
I must have passed out.
When I woke up, I was in my hotel room.
Imagine that.
Yeah, three days later.
I've just got to find her and apologise to her.
Well, it's a little hard to tell where Serena will be at any given moment.
She travels, you know.
But I'll give her your message.
And in the meantime, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.
- As a matter of fact, I'd be rather pleased.
- What do you mean?
Well, you made the trip a lot easier and a lot cheaper than the guys from NASA.
Well, that makes sense.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Barbour Peaches.
Barbour Peaches.
"Whole, sliced or halves, "everything's peachy when you buy Barbour Peaches".
No.
"If you're picky, pick your peaches out of a Barbour can".
Can you stop for a minute?
Yeah.
Believe me, I need a break.
What is it?
It's Tabitha in the new playhouse.
You have to see this.
Come on.
Here's your cup of sugar, Mrs Kravitz.
I'd ask you to come in, but I have company.
Bye, Mrs Kravitz.
- Isn't that cute?
- What does she mean, "company"?
Well, you know, imaginary playmates.
All children make up someone to play with.
Yeah, but - Hi, sweetheart.
Where are you going?
- To get some drinks for my company.
Mr Jones wants a martini, and Mrs Jones wants a ginger ale.
Mrs Jones is a teetotaler.
She is?
Then I'd better get her some tea.
Hurry up.
You don't seem to be amused.
Sam, what if there really is a tiny Mr and Mrs Jones in there?
Darrin, don't be silly.
She's just behaving like any normal six-year-old.
I just want to make sure she isn't behaving like any normal six-year-old witch.
Sorry.
Well, well, well.
Can I have a taste of that martini?
You want Mr Jones to drink out of the same glass as you?
Oops.
Lost my head.
I wish you and Daddy would find something to do while I'm entertaining.
Daddy does have something to do.
I promised Larry I'd have a slogan for Barbour's Peaches by early this afternoon.
- I'd better get back on it.
- And I'd better see if Adam's awake.
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed your lunch, Mr and Mrs Jones, and I'm sorry I burned the meat.
You'd like some more, Mr Jones?
There you are.
It's a pleasure to serve a man with a hearty appetite.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Not meaning to trouble you, lass, but I couldn't help overhearing, and I was wondering if you could spare a morsel for a poor, hungry creature?
We don't have any morsels, but we have some roast beef.
It's a little burned.
Burnt, is it?
Just the way me mother used to make it.
A pleasure it is to make your acquaintance.
- Tim O'Shanter's the name.
- How do you do?
This is Mr and Mrs Jones.
Well, how do you do, Mr Jones?
- No, that's Mrs Jones.
- So it is.
Excuse me.
- And what might your name be?
- Tabitha.
Would you be off to getting me a bit of food?
It's fairly starving, I am.
- Help yourself.
- There's nothing there.
- Yes, there is.
- No, there's not.
You eat what's in front of you, or else you don't eat at all.
You've got a delightful sense of humour, me darling.
And now that we've had our little laugh, would you be after getting me some real food, you little sweetheart?
I'll see what I can find.
A darling girl.
A darling girl.
Weird, but darling.
Will you stop stalling and start doing your thing?
- What do you think I brought you here for?
- That I will, O gracious queen.
I'm not your queen.
And get up off your knees.
You see, it's just that I'm in need of a bit of sustenance, and it's terrible hard to work on an empty stomach.
You'll find it even harder if I turn you into a toadstool.
Now get going!
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
How's Louise?
Fine.
She's spending the weekend on the phone.
How's everything here?
Great.
We're enjoying an unusual stretch of peace and quiet.
We got a playhouse for Tabitha, and we haven't heard a word out of her.
Really?
Maybe I ought to get one of those for Louise.
- What a surprise.
- Hi, Larry.
Thought I heard you.
- I'm not ready for you yet.
- I just dropped by for an interim check.
How's it going?
You want the truth, or you want me to make you feel good?
- You can't do both?
- Tabitha, where are you going with that?
- Out to the playhouse.
- But you had a big lunch just an hour ago.
It's not for me.
It's for the leprechaun.
Excuse me.
Don't let it throw you.
She's been entertaining imaginary friends all morning.
If you're smart, you'll get that leprechaun to help you with the slogan.
That's funny.
Well, I don't want to hold you up.
I think I'll go out and hit a bucket of balls.
I'll check back later.
But Tabitha, how do you know a leprechaun would like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
Because he told me.
Ask a foolish question.
Honey, that sandwich is really for you, isn't it?
No, Daddy, it's for the leprechaun.
Well, for make-believe people, pretend food is good enough.
Okay, Daddy, but the leprechaun won't be happy.
Well, when you entertained Mr and Mrs Jones, you served them imaginary roast beef.
Now why does the leprechaun need real food?
Because he's real and they weren't.
Now, that's ridiculous.
My stars!
Sam, what's going on?
You look like Pinocchio, Daddy.
Take my advice, Tabitha.
Cool it.
I fail to see anything funny about this.
You should look in the mirror.
Tabitha, that's enough.
Now you fix your father's nose immediately.
I can't.
I didn't do it.
- I suppose the leprechaun did it.
- Darrin, maybe she is telling the truth.
- Maybe there is a leprechaun out there.
- Now don't be ridiculous.
Sam, don't just stand there.
Find that leprechaun!
You come out of there!
Come out!
Come on!
Now stop!
Cease and desist!
What is all this hullabaloo?
I did you no harm.
You may not think so, but my husband feels quite differently.
Now you put his nose and ears back to normal!
Well, come on!
Okay, go ahead.
What nose?
What ears?
That nose and those ears.
Now you change them back at once, or you'll regret it.
I don't think you know who or what I am.
More to the point, I don't think you know who or what I am.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
They're gone, Daddy!
Tabitha, I don't know what to say.
And as soon as we get rid of this thing, I'll apologise properly.
I don't know who you are or why you're here, and I'd rather not know.
Now, Darrin, wait a minute.
I'd like some answers.
What are you doing here?
Oh, sure, and it's a long story, and a sad story, and a story that'll set your tears to flowing.
Somebody took me magic shillelagh, and I've got no power to travel home.
Unless I find a witch to restore me power, there's no way for me to get back to me home.
Oh, sure and give me power back!
Okay, it's restored.
Now you better start travelling.
Yours are darling people.
Darling people.
And I thank you for the kindness and hospitality of your home.
Well, that, I hope, is that.
Sam, you don't suppose that leprechaun could've helped me with a slogan for Yeah.
I'd better get back to work.
I think I'm cracking up.
It's just my luck to pick a goof-up leprechaun.
Well, what would you have me do?
Herself just threw me out of the house.
But the dear, sweet witch, she did restore me powers to travel.
Well, the big, bad witch has un-restored them, and they'll stay un-restored until you finish the job you've been assigned.
If you're such a big, bad witch, why don't you do the job yourself?
I never interfere in my daughter's marital life.
You're as full of shenanigans as I am.
Never mind the noise.
Go on with your job.
But the fair blonde one, she'll pulverise me.
Not Not if we're clever about it.
- Then I take it you have something in mind?
- Yes.
- Sam?
- In here, sweetheart.
Did you come up with a slogan for the peaches?
No, but look what I found outside the den door with this note.
"My host you were for a time today.
I leave these shoes my debt to pay".
- From the leprechaun.
- Yeah.
How about that?
Well, why would he leave you a gift when we practically threw him out of here?
Well, maybe it's his way of apologising for bugging us.
Look at these.
Custom-made, leather-lined.
Darrin, maybe you shouldn't keep them.
Why?
According to legend, it's bad luck not to accept a gift from a leprechaun.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Well, maybe.
But why take chances?
Fit like a glove.
You'd better get to work.
Larry will be back soon.
Who cares?
- But you said you hadn't finished.
- So what?
I slaved enough this weekend.
I'm pooped.
I think I'll take a nap.
It's those shoes!
That sneaky leprechaun put a hex on them.
Now, why blame the leprechaun, just 'cause I finally got some sense - and refuse to knock myself out?
- Darrin, I want you to take off those shoes!
That's Larry.
I'll get it.
Well, wait a minute.
Maybe it'd be better if I talked to him.
What for?
Well, because I don't think you're in the right frame of mind.
The only thing wrong with my frame of mind is that I didn't get it years ago.
Hi, Larry.
Good to see you.
Well, that hearty greeting can mean only one thing.
- You got the slogan, right?
- Wrong.
You're not finished?
No.
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm not going to finish tonight.
You mean you're going to get up early and work?
Larry, you're looking at a new man.
From now on, the only time I'm gonna be up early is if I don't go to bed.
Is he drunk?
No.
No, it's just fatigue.
You know we have to present that slogan at the meeting tomorrow morning.
Larry, maybe you should come back a little later.
- You know what your trouble is?
- Right now, it's you.
You're so busy driving, you can't see the road.
- Work is a sickness with you.
- Yes.
- But it's obviously not contagious.
- Larry, it's just the strain of overwork.
I'm sure he'll come up with something if he can just get a little rest.
Let's hope so because if he doesn't, he's gonna have a nice, long rest.
And the same to you, fellow.
Sam.
Sam, I think I'll take a little snooze.
Darrin!
Sam, I thought I told you I was going to take a nap.
And I'm telling you to take off those shoes!
You're right.
That would certainly be more comfortable.
- I can't get them off.
- I was afraid of that.
You little imp!
Madam!
Madam!
Madam, you're tempting fate.
Don't you know it is the worst of luck to harm a leprechaun?
That only applies to good leprechauns.
Where'd she go?
Where'd she go?
You got me.
But I certainly want to thank you for these shoes.
They're terrific.
Hey, you'll not get off that easy.
I've got eyes on the back of me head, I have!
You get those shoes off him, or I'll pulverise you!
Let me go.
Let me go, or those shoes will be on his feet for the rest of his days!
- Let me go!
- Okay.
- Now, why did you do that?
- You asked me to let you go.
Just what we need.
A funny witch.
Sam, it doesn't matter about the shoes.
They're as comfortable as they can be.
If I have to, I can sleep in them.
Well, thanks a lot, but I prefer you bare-feet.
Now, why did you come back, and what is it you're after?
What is it I'm after?
I'll tell you what I'm after.
I'm after wanting a drink to warm me bones.
- For Pete's sake.
- That's what I'm after.
Hey, he's pretty cute.
Just what we need.
A funny leprechaun.
Well, what'll you have?
Anything.
Anything at all, as long as it's fermented.
Whisky would be nice.
And if it's Irish, you'll get no complaint from me.
Well, Irish it is, and Irish it'll always be.
Come along, me boyo.
- Mommy!
- In here, sweetheart.
Here we are.
"A potion to gain control over leprechauns".
But, Mommy, I thought we had a rule, no witchcraft.
Yeah.
Well, that's right, sweetheart, and we only use witchcraft in extreme emergencies.
What's an emergency?
Well, that's when you have to do something right away to save someone from harm.
Now, wait a minute.
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.
"Potion to gain control over a leprechaun".
To one cup of wolfs bane, add two tablespoons of maiden fern, chopped finely, add the beaten yolks of two eggs of a red-eyed Kahlua bird.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Now, zap up one chicken with vegetables and boil in water until tender.
That's chicken soup.
"This is chicken soup, "a favourite of leprechauns.
Put potion in soup.
Serves four".
Excuse me, honey.
I have to start cooking on all burners.
Soup's on!
- Now, will you sit here?
- Bless you.
That's the best-smelling chicken soup I ever smelled.
Well, I hope you like it.
Whist, now!
Is that a baby's cry I hear?
- I don't hear anything.
- Neither do I. My imagination.
Sam, let's eat.
I'm starving.
Fine.
- Oh, dear.
- I'll get it.
It's amazing.
That wind came up from nowhere.
Well, let's get started, shall we?
I'm anxious to get your opinion.
- Okay, dinner's over.
- What?
You take those shoes off right now!
- Hold on, now!
- I am going to count to three.
- One!
Two!
- Okay, okay.
They're off.
Sam, I'm a little confused.
- What's going on?
- Hold it.
- Has Larry been here yet?
- Twice.
And you better get back to that drawing board - and get cracking before he shows up again.
- Not until I find out what's going on here.
Okay, out with it.
I want to know who sent you here.
I swear, I don't know the lady's name.
You are going to make a beautiful toad.
Is that all you and your mother ever think of, toads and toadstools?
Sam, that tears it.
It means your mother has run out of ideas to torment me, and now she's getting outside help.
All right, me bucko.
I think it's time you returned to the old sod.
Here's your hat.
What's your hurry?
All right, you useless little blabbermouth!
You're free to go now.
Thank you, gracious queen.
And now, if you'll just be good enough to return me magic shillelagh, I'll be off.
Gladly.
Good-bye and good riddance, you old hag!
Darrin.
I'm sorry.
I'll make it up to you.
- No, it's not your fault.
- Then Mother will make it up to you.
- It's not your mother's fault either.
- It isn't?
No.
It's all my fault.
It is?
It was something I said.
- What?
- "I do".
Darrin!
And I'd say it all over again, in spite of your mother and leprechauns and all the craziness.
You're the greatest witch a man ever had.
Now I'd better get back to work on that slogan.
Mother?
Mother?
You're a stubborn witch!
Mom?
Mother?
Mother, dear?
Mother, my love?
What is it now?
Nothing special.
Does there have to be a reason for a daughter to want to spend a few happy moments with her mother?
Samantha, you needn't be nasty about it.
Me, nasty?
I sent that leprechaun for your own good.
It was a test, and I'm happy to say, you passed with flying colours.
It was a test to see where the breaking point is in this mortal marriage.
- Really?
- It was sponsored by the Witches' Council.
And who suggested it to the Witches' Council?
I believe the suggestion came from the floor.
All right.
I suggested it.
Okay, Mother, I have a suggestion for you.
Darrin wasted the entire day with that dumb leprechaun instead of trying to come up with a slogan for the account, and that's Larry, so would you kindly zap a good slogan for Barbour Peaches into his head?
I thought Durwood had an ironclad rule against your helping him with witchcraft.
Well, I won't be doing it.
You will.
Very well.
Hey, Larry.
Come on in.
- Well, what are you drinking?
- Nothing.
Louise is holding dinner for me, so let's have it.
- You mean the slogan.
- What else?
You did come up with something, didn't you?
Well Of course I've got the slogan.
Tell me how you love this?
"Don't shave the fuzz off your peaches.
Let Barbour do it".
Is that the best you could do?
No, but I thought it was the best he could do.
Give me that again.
"Don't shave the fuzz off your peaches.
Let Barbour do it".
You better put a spell on Larry to love it.
I love it!
I don't know why I love it, but I love it.
I'll take that drink now, you son of a gun.
- And just one more thing.
- Now what?
Do you know a way to put a spell on the entire peach-buying public?
- Mom?
- What?
You're a peach.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Darrin.
Do you really remember our first date?
Are you kidding?
I'll tell you exactly what you wore.
It was a red silk dress with buttons up the front.
It was pink, it was wool, and it zipped up the side.
Pink, red, same difference.
We had dinner at The Lobster.
No, we wanted to have dinner at The Lobster, but you forgot to make the reservation, so we ate at the Automat.
What next?
Then we either went to a movie, a concert, or took a walk along Fifth Avenue.
Who cares?
Somewhere, sometime that night I kissed you for the first time.
Yeah.
You do remember.
I think I'm getting sick to my stomach.
- Mother.
- Samantha, my darling.
Darwin.
A celebration!
- It was, up until a second ago.
- Darwin Darrin!
We were just having the Tates over for dinner.
- Then why an anniversary cake?
- I got it for nothing from the baker.
Someone cancelled a party, so we had to come up with an anniversary to go with it, and we did.
Our first date.
Why not celebrate the sinking of the Titanic?
What I'd really like to celebrate is your departure.
- Sorry you can't stay for dinner.
- Thanks.
I'd love to stay.
Mother, you don't really want to stay for dinner.
No, but he just talked me into it.
A guest never comes empty-handed.
- This is for you, darling.
- Thank you, Mother.
What is it?
Well, it's a little something that's been cluttering up my closet for centuries.
I thought you might enjoy it.
Mother!
Mother, thank you.
- That looks almost like the Mona Lisa.
- And why not?
It was painted by the same artist, Leonardo da Vinci.
- It can't be!
- You want to bet?
Sam, I don't mean to pry, and it's probably none of my business, but, well, is this You mean, you think that's Silly boy.
That's my great-aunt Cornelia.
Isn't it, Mother?
Well, she wasn't a great aunt.
As a matter of fact, I thought she was rather ordinary, but she was very pretty, like Samantha.
Leo was mad about her.
Sweetheart, I know it takes getting used to, but the family was in Italy at the time, and he rather liked us.
He liked anything in skirts, or out of them.
He was a sweet, dirty old man.
If I hadn't chaperoned Cornelia while he was painting her, she would have ended up as a centrefold in the Galaxy Gazette.
There.
It adds a bit of class to this bourgeois establishment.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like our old painting back.
I want to keep this house bourgeois until this evening is over.
I'm not about to explain to our guests about Leonardo and Aunt Cornelia.
Sam, are you sure it's Aunt Cornelia?
Would I lie to you, Darrin?
There's the doorbell.
I didn't hear any doorbell.
Why wait till the last minute?
That's a good-looking suit.
- Why don't you wear it at the office?
- Endora.
- Larry!
- Don't you look lovely!
Well, if it isn't the glamorous, ever-popular Endora.
A simple curtsy will do.
- You're out of this world.
- You might say that.
Is that pot roast I smell?
Smell again.
Well, that's not pot roast.
What is it?
- Lobster thermidor.
- Mother, that wasn't necessary.
It is if I'm staying for dinner, darling.
- Well, what'll you have?
- The usual.
Coming right up.
Why, Samantha, how lovely.
- What's that doing up there?
- It's hanging on a nail, dear boy.
What a beautiful likeness, Samantha.
And such a clever idea!
It's reminiscent of the Mona Lisa.
- Who did it?
- Leonardo da Vinci did it.
- Mother, stop fooling around.
- I meant Leonardo da Vinci did it first.
And Darrin copied it.
Darrin!
Beautifully, too, I might add.
Actually, an old friend of Darrin's did it.
A friend of yours, huh?
Then how come you signed it?
I signed it?
You son of a gun, you're good.
- You signed it.
- Darrin, it's remarkable.
Well, I guess it is kind of remarkable, for an amateur.
Amateur?
Well, you're a master.
Behind every great man, there's a mother-in-law to spur him on.
Well, Mother, in the future, leave the spurring to me.
Dinner's ready.
Certainly, Mother.
- Thank you, Sam.
- Did you notice that no matter where we moved in the living room, the eyes seemed to follow us?
It's just like the real Mona Lisa.
How'd you do it?
Well, if he told you, everybody would know.
That's right.
How was your golf yesterday, Larry?
Not bad.
On the back nine I shot a - When did he paint it?
- Ages ago.
- You shot a what?
- A 45.
- You must be very proud of your son-in-law.
- Proud is hardly the word.
Forty-five isn't bad.
I wish Darrin would play more golf.
How can you say that?
Why, he should spend every free moment painting.
- You're a brilliant artist, Darrin.
- No, not brilliant.
I'm just very good.
- This lobster thermidor is brilliant.
- Thank you.
Well, now, you can't compare the two.
I mean, any good cook can make lobster thermidor.
Out of pot roast?
Mother was just making a little joke.
So, you shot a 45.
Can't we keep just one conversation going at a time?
Darrin, why don't you paint more often?
Well, there is no explanation except plain laziness.
- I'll buy that.
- Samantha, you should encourage him.
I do!
I've been after him for weeks to paint the kitchen.
Well, that is not exactly what I had in mind.
Do you know what a woman would give to have a portrait like that?
Darrin, I think that's a subtle hint setting you up for something.
- It is?
- Like your painting her picture.
- Would you, Darrin?
- He couldn't possibly.
That's right.
I have to paint the kitchen first.
Darrin, take it from a man who knows.
There are times when it's easier to say yes.
He'll do the picture, sweetheart.
Larry, you don't understand.
It's just not possible.
Look, Darrin.
If I had your talent and Sam asked me to do her picture, I'd do it.
And you're not even my boss.
Now just think about that.
Be sure you bring everything you need.
Now, we'll see you tomorrow, right after lunch.
- Night, Sam.
- Good night.
Mother!
You have done some pretty vile things to Darrin in the past, but what you did tonight was unforgivable.
- How could you be so cruel?
- Are you kidding, Sam?
She majored in cruelty with the Marquis de Sade.
Not at all.
He was just a classmate.
Endora, I've had it with you.
I mean, I've had it with you up to here.
If you are out to destroy Darrin's life, you have almost succeeded.
Almost doesn't count.
The Marquis de Sade was Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm compared to you.
I have been insulted here for the last time.
You shall never see me again.
Promises!
Promises!
Darrin, you have got to calm down.
Yeah, I've got to calm down.
If I calm down, I can think clearly, and if I think clearly, I'll come up with an answer.
- And I've come up with an answer.
- Good.
- I'll kill myself.
- Darrin.
All right, I won't kill myself.
I'll What I'll do is I'll tell Larry the truth.
That painting is by Leonardo da Vinci.
I am a fraud.
My wife is a witch, and my mother-in-law is a - You wouldn't dare!
- Wouldn't I?
No.
I wouldn't.
All right.
I'm fresh out of ideas.
Well, I'm not.
Anything Mother can do, I can do better.
- Are you suggesting - Just one teensy little spell.
Enough to get that picture painted.
Now, I'll go with you to the Tates, - and you can use my paints - No!
No!
From this moment on, all spells, hexes, incantations, etcetera and so forth are strictly forbidden.
Any mention andlor use of said devices by any member of this family - is punishable by - I'll get you a tranquiliser.
I don't want a tranquiliser.
I want an answer.
Now, how do I get out of this?
Well, you could break your right arm.
You can't paint with a broken arm.
- Yeah, where's the hammer?
- Darrin, I was just kidding.
All right, I won't break my arm.
I'll pretend I broke it.
I'll go to an orthopaedic man, and I'll rent a cast.
That's a great idea.
All you have to do is wear that cast until Louise forgets about the painting, which will be never.
Okay.
I've got one last suggestion, and this has got to work.
- What?
- You'll put a spell on me.
I wish I'd thought of that.
- Come in!
- Well, Louise!
- My goodness, that is really something.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- You should thank him.
The money that went for that dress was Darrin's Christmas bonus.
Larry, will you stop exaggerating?
It's really very reasonable, for what it is.
Sure!
If you're going to be crowned Queen of England, it's a steal.
I hope you don't mind my coming along.
Darrin likes to have me around when he starts a painting.
We can pass the time playing gin or something.
Gin it is.
Penny a point.
Maybe I can win back the price of that dress.
You're on.
Shall we set up?
- Where do I sit?
- Anyplace.
I don't care.
Where would you like your easel, sweetheart?
Wherever you think.
What kind of an attitude is that?
"Sit anywhere, put it wherever you think".
Look, Darrin, if you're going to slough it off He's not.
He's not.
I promise you.
It'll turn out at least as well as my painting.
Well, let's get the show on the road.
Samantha, would you get the paints - out of the box?
- Oh, sure.
And, let's see, I'll need a table here and my turpentine over there.
The brushes here.
I think the easel over there.
How do you set this fool thing up?
You picked up a seven of clubs, a five of diamonds and a king of hearts.
- You sure you know how to play this game?
- Throw a card.
- Sam, I'm ready to paint.
- Then paint.
- What are you bothering her for?
- Well, he can't Unless I kiss him first.
It's kind of a tradition, like launching a ship.
Well, just hold the kiss for a minute.
Now, this card has to be safe.
Gin.
You caught me with 70 points.
- Sam.
- Coming, sweetheart.
Louise, that really is lovely.
- Let's get the show on the road.
- Just relax, sweetheart.
- I don't feel anything.
- You will in a minute.
- You got me on a blitz.
- Well.
Pretty lucky for a beginner.
- He's painting like he's got a demon in him.
- Well, he does, sort of.
Now, concentrate on the game.
- Can I have one little peek?
- You can see it when it's finished.
Sam.
Oh, Sam!
Stop bothering her.
I'm being blitzed!
Gin.
I give up.
Between that dress and my gin losses this free painting's costing me a fortune.
- I'm telling you, it better be good.
- Where are you going?
I'm gonna take a look at it.
No, not now.
Not yet.
I want Sam to look at it first.
Let him see it, Darrin.
No, it's - May I take a look at it, too?
- Not yet, sweetheart.
You must be exhausted from sitting so long.
Why don't you go upstairs and lie down?
Well, I'm not tired.
And I want to see my painting.
Well, if you're not tired, why don't you get us some coffee?
- Is something wrong, Larry?
- I said get us some coffee.
I'm going.
I'm going!
Well, isn't that - interesting?
- The word is insulting.
- Larry, I told you I was out of practice.
- Are you kidding?
If this is supposed to be some kind of a practical joke, you missed the mark.
Now, wait.
Wait, Larry.
I mean, isn't it interesting how the eyes follow you wherever you go.
From my angle, the eyes are looking at each other.
Darrin, I'm surprised that you would indulge in such a tasteless prank.
- Well, Larry, I - Ex-friends call me Mr Tate.
I thank you to leave and take that atrocity with you.
Mother!
"Dropped by to say hello.
"Esmeralda told me you were at the Tates'.
Love, Mother.
"P.S.
This note will self-destruct before you can say" She can't even keep her word.
She said she was never coming back here again.
I guess she couldn't resist just one last funny.
I thought your mother couldn't change one of your spells.
Well, she didn't change it.
She just added to it.
- Louise, I'm trying to spare your feelings.
- It can't be as bad as you say.
But believe me, it is.
Now please, let's go home.
No!
I want to see my painting.
Louise, you've been the victim of a very bad joke.
And that's putting it very delicately.
I will be the judge of that.
- Now what'll we do?
- Let them in.
I think I can subtract Mother's little addition.
- Hi.
Did I forget something?
- Yes.
You forgot to show me my painting.
That was not very nice of you to rush off like that.
I'll never forgive you for this.
Samantha, is there any reason why I should not see my painting?
None that I can think of.
You're not only fired, but I'll make it my life's work to see to it that you're never hired anyplace, anytime, anywhere.
How can you call this a bad joke?
- Well, he repainted it.
- Don't be ridiculous.
He got here just two minutes before we did.
- What are you crying about?
- Because you called it an atrocity, and it looks exactly like me.
Louise.
Louise.
It's a compliment, Louise.
No.
You see, what he's saying is that nothing could come close to your real inner beauty.
After all, a canvas is one-dimensional, and you are a lovely, vibrant, exciting, three-dimensional woman.
Really, Larry?
- Would Sam lie to you?
- I can't take my eyes off me.
How did you change it?
Larry, I give you my solemn word, I did not change it.
- That is not the same face.
- Well, of course it is.
You know what I think it was?
You were upset because I blitzed you at gin, and in the stress and anger of the moment, well, you just weren't seeing things clearly.
It can happen.
Ask any psychiatrist.
- I'd like to believe that.
- Darrin?
I know it's asking too much, but, well, you're so talented, and you paint so quickly, - and Larry's birthday is coming up - Absolutely not.
Darrin, I like your spunk, but as your boss, don't forget, I hold your fortune in my hand.
Sweetheart, I guess we'll just have to tell them the truth.
Sam, are you crazy?
Now, I am not going to go through this again.
- Sam!
- The doctors made him give it up because of this rare allergy he has to paint.
- That truth.
- He looks okay to me.
Wait.
It hasn't gotten all the way into his bloodstream yet.
In just a moment he'll begin to sneeze.
And it gets worse.
He develops a nervous tic.
- It'll go away in a minute.
- That's terrible.
Sam, don't ex aggerate.
My psy chiatrist?
- Yeah.
He says that my My, my Forget it.
Forget it.
If I want a picture, I'll use my Brownie.
- Now, you just take it home and enjoy it.
- I will.
I will.
I'm so sorry about poor Darrin.
Yeah, well, don't worry about him.
A day in bed, and he'll be just fine.
- Take it easy, feller.
- I sure will.
- Wow.
So long, Sam.
- Yeah, Larry.
Bye-bye, Louise.
Bye.
Sam I'm sorry, sweetheart.
- Was all that absolutely necessary?
- Well, it worked, didn't it?
Sam, there's got to be a reason.
It just can't be plain meanness.
Why does your mother behave the way she does?
Well, I'm not sure, sweetheart.
Mother's like a kid.
She likes to play those silly pranks.
But she's not a kid.
A woman her age should settle down, take up basket weaving or croquet or something.
You forget, Mother is ageless.
Yeah.
Like mother, like daughter.
I'll I'll put that in the attic first thing in the morning.
Sam, is that really your great-aunt Cornelia or is it you?
I said it was my great-aunt Cornelia.
Well, if you say so.
But I was just thinking.
Even if it is your great-aunt Cornelia, you could have been painted by Toulouse-Lautrec or Renoir.
- Don't tell me you weren't around then.
- So?
So you look the same then as you do now.
Well, sweetheart, I can't help that.
It's my metabolism.
But I'm thinking ahead.
If you look the same then as you do now, thirty years from now, you'll still look the same.
And me, I'll look like I'm supposed to look.
Paunchy, wrinkled, maybe bald.
It'll be embarrassing when this old man takes this young chick for a walk.
- What'll people say?
- People will say, "I bet that old man has some pretty young ideas "to keep that chick interested".
Yeah.
Yeah!
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
- Here's some more coffee, sweetheart.
- Thanks.
Sam.
Will you give me your opinion of this Mother's Day card?
- The rose looks wilted.
- Now read the poem.
"In all the world, there is naught Dearer to us than the thought "That other loves may quickly perish But Mother's love, we always cherish" In my opinion, the poem goes great with the rose.
That's not the opinion of Augustus Sunshine.
Who's Augustus Sunshine?
Owner and head writer of the Happy Heart Greeting Card Company.
Their sales have been slipping, and Mr Sunshine can't understand why.
Why don't you show him in red and white?
Why don't I forget about business, and let's go to a movie?
Okay.
I'll get Esmeralda.
Yoo-hoo!
Esmeralda!
Yoo-hoo!
Good evening, Samantha.
Good evening, Mr Stephens.
Good evening, Esmeralda.
How are all the guys and gals in the cosmos?
I wouldn't know.
I only care about one guy, Ramon Verona.
Tonight I have a date with him.
Oh, dear.
We were hoping you could baby-sit.
Well, any other time, but I couldn't cancel him now.
- Not after all that pleading.
- He was pleading with you?
No.
I was pleading with him.
That's our little game.
Ramon plays hard to get, and I play a cinch.
Goodbye.
Have a good game.
Well, by process of elimination Mother!
Mother?
Greetings, all.
I just came from the international dune buggy races.
Just once, couldn't your mother come into a room in a normal way?
- How did you do?
- I won.
But I was disqualified because my wheels were off the ground.
Well, your wheels are on my rug, and I'll thank you to get them off.
He sounds huffy to me.
Does he sound huffy to you?
Mother, we were wondering if you'd mind baby-sitting while we go to a movie.
I would have loved to, except that Durwood's being huffy to me.
- I'm not being huffy.
- Yes, you are.
And one more word, and I'm leaving.
- Okay.
- That's the word.
Sam, don't you have anything to say?
"In all the world, there is naught Dearer to us than the thought "That other loves may quickly perish But Mother's love, we always cherish" I didn't wanna go to the movies anyway.
Sweetheart?
There is a way to make Mother more friendly.
Okay, let's hear it.
- Well, there's this magic amulet - Forget it.
I've got enough magic in my life.
Oh, really?
Present company excepted.
I didn't wanna go to the movies anyway.
Sweetheart!
It's 8:00.
Okay.
Okay.
Good morning, Durwood.
Samantha!
What's the matter?
What happened?
Your mother happened.
That's what happened.
- Well, I'll have a talk with her.
- Never mind the talking.
Just get the amulet.
- Daddy has it.
- Hurry back.
This is it.
Daddy used it throughout the centuries whenever Mother got out of line.
- I'm surprised it isn't worn out by now.
- But now, since they go their separate ways, I convinced him that, for the moment, you need it more than he does.
- Let's try it out.
- Now, wait a minute.
There are two rules.
One, keep it with you at all times.
And two, don't abuse it.
Because using witchcraft on a powerful witch, like Mother, is living dangerously.
Well, sweetheart, with your mother as my mother-in-law, - I live dangerously every day.
- Put it in your pocket, and I'll call her.
Mother!
Mother?
- Good morning, Samantha.
- Good morning, Mother.
Good morning, Darrin.
Good morning who?
Darrin, dear boy.
Would you accept my humble apologies for my slight transgressions of this morning and last night?
I behaved frightfully.
Your behaviour last night was frightful.
This morning, it was hideous.
- Darrin.
- The dear boy is quite right.
It's no way for a mother-in-law to treat her son-in-law.
Would you accept my apology?
- Well - Would you think about it?
- Yeah, I'll think about it.
- Thank you.
Excuse me, Mother, but Darrin's late for work.
I'll see you later, Endora.
And I'd appreciate it if you'd wear something less weird.
Anything you say, dear boy.
Oh, brother.
- It worked.
- Yes, I know.
It worked like a charm.
But let's not forget she's being nice to you against her will.
Who cares?
I'll take her being nice to me any way I can get it.
Let's not make her suspicious.
If she finds out that I've given you Daddy's amulet, we're both in for it.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Mother, you all right?
- No.
My disgustingly sweet behaviour toward Durwood indicates I'm quite ill.
Mother, you're just being kind and considerate.
There's no question about it.
I'm sick.
I'd better make an appointment with Dr Bombay for a thorough checkup.
There's no time to lose.
Mr Stephens, look who came to town to pay us a surprise visit.
- Mr Augustus Sunshine.
- Mr Sunshine, it's a pleasure to meet you.
"In the recipe of life, the ideal blendship To ward off strife is known as friendship" Happy Heart greeting card number 3417-Y.
Words to live by.
- Right, Mr Stephens?
- Right, Mr Tate.
- I wonder why that card hasn't been selling.
- I blame it on inflation and tight money.
Mr Stephens, be frank with me.
Do you think the poems on my greeting cards may be outdated?
Well, Mr Sunshine, now that you mention it Mr Stephens, you haven't forgotten that Mr Sunshine writes those poems?
Well, no, but I'm sure Mr Sunshine wants an honest appraisal.
Would you like an honest appraisal, Mr Sunshine?
- Certainly.
- Go ahead, Mr Stephens.
Well, your poems, Mr Sunshine, were very effective in their time, but in today's uptight world, people like to exchange cards that have more humour.
You're saying that my poems are outdated.
Well, perhaps they are outdated.
Then, on the other hand, perhaps the advertising concepts being used are outdated, and I need a new advertising agency.
Goodbye, Stephens.
Nice to have met you.
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, hi.
- How was your day?
- Fine.
- How was yours?
- Not so fine.
It looks like we've lost that greeting card account.
But who cares?
My life is a lot simpler since I've got my safety badge from evil.
Hey, why don't you call your mother?
I haven't seen her all day, and I miss her.
Darrin, this is not for fun and games.
It is to be used in self-defence and with great discretion.
Okay, okay.
Whatever you say.
I'll go look in on the kids.
- You want anything from the kitchen?
- No, thanks, sweetheart.
- You hungry?
- Yeah.
And now that I'm on such good terms with your mother, my appetite for life has increased.
Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow Samantha?
May I speak to you?
Come in, Mother.
Samantha, I just saw Dr Bombay, and he gave me a clean bill of health.
- That's wonderful.
- That's terrible.
If there's nothing physically wrong with me, why have I been so nice to Durwood?
Well, Mother, maybe, after all these years, his charm and natural sweetness has finally reached you.
You're not keeping any secrets from me, are you?
Who, me?
You would never be a party to casting a spell on me, would you?
- Who, me?
- Of course not.
If there's anyone I can trust, it's you.
Who, me?
Hi.
- Hi, Moms.
- I'm here to enjoy our newfound friendship.
Well, care to make me a sandwich?
Endora, I asked you to make me a sandwich.
Make it yourself, Durwood.
Durwood?
Make it yourself and then choke on it.
Endora, would you excuse me a second?
I have to Kiddo, you're not going anywhere.
Samantha!
Sounds like trouble.
That is trouble.
What happened to me shouldn't happen to a dog.
So, if you want your sandwich, beg for it.
Sit.
Beg.
Play dead.
I think I'll leave him that way.
Mother, what are you doing?
Feeding my pet.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Darrin, forgive me.
I forgot all about your sandwich.
Never mind, Endora.
I seem to have lost my appetite.
- And besides, he's dog tired.
- The poor dear.
- Don't call us.
We'll call you.
- Anything you say, Darrin.
If Mother ever finds out about that amulet, you are going to learn that - Which means?
- Hell hath no fury like a bugged witch.
Hello.
Darrin, I've invited Augustus Sunshine over to the club.
We're having lunch, and I've been trying to persuade him not to change agencies.
- How are you doing?
- Not so good.
We just finished a round of golf, and I even managed to lose to him, but I had to shoot a 97 to do it.
- Well, that's not so bad.
- For nine holes?
Anyway, it didn't work, so I thought that I'd bring him over to your place for dessert.
- Why?
- Why do you think?
So you can help me hang on to the account you managed to jeopardise.
We'll be there in an hour.
Tell Samantha not to go to any trouble, just serve something elegant.
- Who was that?
- Larry.
And in an hour, he's bringing Augustus Sunshine here, and we're supposed to serve him an elegant dessert.
What for?
He thinks we can hang on to the account with some socialising.
Well, I suppose that's the least we can do.
Elegant dessert, huh?
The Gourmet Pastry Shop, but you'll have to drive me.
It's always so crowded, - I can never find a parking space.
- Okay.
Esmeralda?
Yes, Samantha?
Do you think you could baby-sit for a while this afternoon?
The way things are going in my romance department, I'll be able to baby-sit for the rest of my life.
You ought to get yourself something like this.
- What is it?
- Darrin, put that away.
Yeah, sorry.
Just kidding.
- Kidding about what?
- Nothing.
Forget it.
Tabitha's playing on the patio, and Adam's having his nap.
We'll be back in half an hour.
Come on.
Could it be a love charm?
Obviously.
How else could a mortal like him make a witch like Samantha fall in love with him?
Tough luck, Ramon!
You're mine!
Hello.
Goodbye.
Hi, Mother.
You came at a bad time.
We're expecting Don't you "Hi, Mother" me!
You ungrateful child.
And as for you, beady eyes, you are beneath contempt.
What's wrong, Durwood?
Don't you have the magic amulet?
- She knows.
- You bet your sweet broomstick I know.
I began thinking about ancient history, and I remembered the amulet your father once had.
- What happened to it?
- Esmeralda.
That's why she was so anxious to get out of here.
So I went to Maurice, who could never lie to me, and I extracted a full confession.
Mother, I I Samantha, I'm hurt.
And I'm angry.
And I'm so furious, I'm going to punish the both of you.
"You set aside your true emotions Your loving, marital devotions "The air around you now grows thicker As under my spell you constantly bicker" What do you think she's gonna do?
How should I know, stupid?
Well, you should know, blondie.
You're a certified witch.
When I married you, I should have been certified insane.
- Me, too.
- Me, too.
My, aren't you a bottomless pit of originality!
I don't understand it.
Why am I so hostile?
- You got me.
- That's the reason!
Oh, no, it isn't.
It's all your mother's fault.
Let's not drag my mother through this.
I'd like to drag her through something.
Sam, get the door.
I'm busy.
- Busy doing what?
- Reading.
Really?
Didn't know you knew how.
- Hello, Larry.
- Samantha, this is Mr Augustus Sunshine.
Well, it's nice to meet you.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Follow me, gentlemen.
Knucklehead is in the living room.
- Knucklehead?
- I guess it's a term of endearment.
Well, Mr Sunshine, I look forward to chatting with you, providing my wife can keep her big mouth shut, - and we can get a word in edgewise.
- The less you say, buster, the better your chances of appearing intelligent.
- Hey, kids, what's going on here?
- Nothing.
Mr Sunshine, would you like a French pastry?
They look delicious.
Did you bake them yourself?
Are you kidding?
If she'd baked them, the cart would collapse.
- How'd you like a split lip?
- How'd you like a bust in the bazoo?
Sam, why do you let him talk to you like that?
Well, I figure he's my husband, he's got a perfect right.
He's got a pretty good left, too.
Darrin, to change the subject to greeting cards, as I told Mr Sunshine, I have every confidence if we put our shoulders to the wheel If you get the contract, dumbo, I'll show you where to mark your "X".
For two cents, I'd walk out that door and never come back.
Wait here.
I'll get my piggy bank.
Tate, I may be oversensitive, but I feel we walked in on a little domestic quarrel.
Well, Mr Sunshine, I suppose these things can happen, but not in front of a client.
We'd better go.
And as we do, I also leave this thought.
"A lovers' spat is all we had To mix the good with a touch of bad "Now let us once again draw near Whilst saying both, I love you, dear" Happy Heart greeting card number 1803-K.
How about this one?
"Married life is never humdrum When you're stuck with such a dum-dum" Samantha Stephens, number 86.
Good day.
Wait a minute, Mr Sunshine.
I'm sure this is just a momentary thing.
Having fun, kiddies?
Samantha, I thought this was a love charm, but it doesn't work.
- Ramon Verona was as cold as ever.
- Well, of course he was.
That amulet has power over only one person.
Esmeralda, you look lovely.
Ravishing might be the more accurate description.
- Thank you.
- Mother.
Remove the spell.
Anything you say.
"As a witch of great ability I remove this pair's hostility "Heed the message from above You're not sick, you're just in love" - Sweetheart, I'm sorry.
- Why should you be sorry?
Blame your meddling mother.
Ta-ta, Mama.
Ta, darling.
Oh, dear.
What am I gonna tell Larry and Mr Sunshine?
I don't know, but I'd better get them back here.
"Augustus Sunshine and Larry Tate This is Darrin Stephens' mate "To save us all a lot of trouble Come back, fellows, on the double" Tate, I feel a sudden compulsion to go back to the Stephens house.
That's funny.
So do I. In other words, the whole thing was a fake, staged for your benefit.
I don't understand.
Well, Darrin was trying to show you that in today's society people don't always communicate with Well, with sunshine.
Right.
Sometimes people like to bicker.
Good-naturedly, of course.
You call the way you two went at each other good-natured?
Absolutely.
Didn't you see the humour in it?
Yes.
I guess it was pretty funny.
- Wasn't it, Tate?
- Sure.
Stephens, were you trying to tell me that my greeting cards are too namby-pamby?
We just thought it was a unique way of suggesting that you branch out into funny insult cards.
You know, like, "Happy birthday, knucklehead".
Happy birthday, knucklehead?
Well, that's just an example.
I mean, I'm not a professional poet like you, Mr Sunshine.
Funny insult cards.
That's food for thought.
And speaking of food, may I have one of those pastries?
Have two.
Well, he did it again.
- Right, Larry?
- Yeah.
He did it again.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
Hey, I've got a present for you from Daddy.
- Well, that's very nice.
When was he here?
- Today.
Mother was so angry at him for giving us the amulet that she decided to move back in with him for a while just to get even.
Well, I hope you gave the amulet back to him.
I did and he replaced it with a necktie that doesn't do anything.
- I'll write him a thank-you note.
- Don't bother.
He has no address.
I have a present for you from Augustus Sunshine.
It's his first insult poem.
"Season's greetings to my bride Who fills my heart with wondrous pride "She has a figure and a face That best belong in outer space" - How do you like it?
- Well, I don't think it's bad for a first effort, but I wish people wouldn't knock outer space if they haven't been there.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
I think I'll wear the grey knit to Larry and Louise's tonight.
The grey knit?
Not the one with the plunging neckline.
- Well, you loved it the last time I wore it.
- So did a lot of other guys.
It's the only thing I have that Louise hasn't seen.
Sam, the client and his wife are from Boston.
They're against open-toed shoes.
Well, maybe I'll wear a sweatshirt under it.
- Lf we go at all.
- Lf?
Well, I've been trying to get Esmeralda since yesterday.
- I can't seem to reach her.
- Here I am, Samantha.
- Hello, Mr Stephens.
- Good morning, Esmeralda.
I couldn't possibly baby-sit tonight.
Well, why don't you materialise and tell me all about it?
All right.
- Where have you been?
- I have been devastated.
I don't feel up to baby-sitting.
What happened?
Well, you remember a few weeks ago I went out with Ramon Verona?
Oh, yes.
He's the salad chef at the Warlock Club.
Of course.
- Anyway, it was a shocking experience.
- Did he make a pass at you?
No.
And I've never been so insulted in all my life.
He's been dating that little witch in the hatcheck room.
- Oh!
- You know her type.
Dresses up to here and false eyelashes down to there.
And nothing in her head.
With those legs, who needs a head?
Esmeralda, would you mind going upstairs and looking in on Adam?
All right.
But I can only stay a short time.
Well, we have two alternatives.
- What's the second one?
- Don't you want to know the first?
The first is your mother.
What's the second one?
- I could call Dr Bombay.
- That quack?
I'd rather have your mother.
Oh, Darrin.
Esmeralda's in such terrible shape.
He might know a way to cure her depression.
Swell.
And after he does that, who's gonna cure my depression?
Oh, I'll think of something.
Anyway, we'll be helping Esmeralda and helping ourselves at the same time.
Okay.
Bombay it is.
Only, Sam, don't call until I'm out of firing range.
Dr Bombay!
Calling Dr Bombay!
- Dr Oh.
- Morning.
Good morning.
- Sit down.
I'll examine you.
- Dr Bombay, I'm perfectly all right.
That's for me to decide.
Sit down.
Left shoe off.
I'll take your pulse.
No.
Doctor, you don't understand.
It's Esmeralda who needs your help.
She's had a terrible experience with Ramon Verona.
Ate one of his salads, eh?
Dr Bombay, this is serious.
Now, she's been going with him for the past few months, and all of a sudden he just threw her over for that little witch in the checkroom.
Oh, she's terribly depressed.
I was hoping you could give her something to cheer her up.
My dear, you don't want Dr Bombay.
You want Dear Abby.
Goodbye.
Oh, no.
Wait, wait, wait.
Maybe Esmeralda?
- Look who's here.
- Oh, dear.
Esmeralda, Dr Bombay just wants to help you.
Nobody can help me.
I'm a natural-born loser.
That's not true.
No?
What do you call someone who's always pushing doors marked "pull"?
Why don't you go into the kitchen and fix yourself a cup of coffee?
All right.
It might cheer me up, but I doubt it.
There's a lot less to her than meets the eye.
You know what I think, Doctor?
The only way to bolster her ego is to get another man interested in her.
Jolly good idea.
- Why are you staring at me like that?
- You mean you're volunteering?
I just remembered a pressing engagement with my tailor.
Oh, wait.
Wait, if you won't do it, then you have to find another warlock who will.
You must know somebody.
As a matter of fact, someone does come to mind.
Chap named Norton.
I once cured him of the incurable square green spots disease.
What's he like?
Unfortunately, not the greatest personality in the world.
Bit of a loser, in fact.
Sort of short and funny-looking, drinks a bit, too.
Dr Bombay, nobody's perfect.
- I really ought to be going.
- Well, you can't leave, Esmeralda, until Dr Bombay gets back with your cure.
What is it?
A pill?
I hope not.
All right.
You stay here.
I'll flush her out.
Bombay, could you please lower your voice?
You're on the same wavelength as my hangover.
- Well, what's this chick's name?
- Esmeralda.
And you'll thank me.
- What does she look like?
- Oh, she's warm, sweet, intelligent.
- Goodbye.
- Norton.
Did I or did I not cure you from the incurable square green spots disease?
Yes, you did, and I'm very Then the least you can do is take a look at this witch and see what you think.
You have to keep your strength up or you'll fade away to nothing.
If I'm lucky.
Now go ahead.
Peek in, and if you don't like her, you can leave.
There you go.
I hope this cure Dr Bombay's bringing isn't going to hurt.
I think you're going to be pleasantly surprised.
- I am?
- I might as well tell you.
- He's bringing a friend for you.
- Oh, no.
Well?
- She really appeals to you?
- Oh, I'll say.
Well, you never can tell.
Esmeralda.
Yes.
You are going to have to promise me that when Dr Bombay shows up with his friend, you won't fade out.
All right.
But I really don't feel like meeting anybody.
There you are.
I want you to meet a friend of mine.
Esmeralda, this is Norton.
Norton, this is Esmeralda.
Well, I'm certainly glad to meet you.
You know, I almost didn't agree to come here.
I could almost laugh when I think of it.
This is Esmeralda.
No.
No, you're Esmeralda.
You see, when he told me to look in here, and I looked in here, and you were the one who was That's why you've got to be.
She's Esmeralda?
Oh, dear.
Dr Bombay, I don't think Esmeralda's going to be able to hang in there much longer.
How you doing?
My dear girl, you can't rush a thing like a love potion.
It calls for the utmost precision and care.
Hello.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
You'll make what up to me?
Well, Louise is having one of her migraine headaches, so guess who's going to have the pleasure of entertaining Larry and the Meiklejohns tonight.
Well, I hope it's Oscar of the Waldorf, but I know better.
I know it's late in the day to spring this on you, so if you have to, you know, take some shortcuts, I'll understand.
Well, fortunately that won't be necessary.
I have some steaks in the freezer.
You're beautiful.
I'll be home early to help.
Oh, and make some of that clam dip of yours, Larry loves it.
Okay.
But you tell Larry that if I have to make one more dinner for a client, I want to go on the payroll.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Dr Bombay I have a slight problem.
My husband is coming home early, and we're having company for dinner.
This won't take but another moment.
Or two.
Dr Bombay, how much longer is this going to take?
- I'll be done in a jiffy.
- That's what you said over an hour ago.
What does that do?
Nothing.
It's just for eating.
It's my clam dip.
You don't say.
Scotch and soda.
Does this potion work in the usual way?
Yes.
After imbibing this potion, the imbibee is smitten by the first person he sees, of the opposite sex, of course.
Is there a chance he'll refuse the drink?
If he does, he'll be breaking a lifetime habit.
Well, here goes nothing.
- Ready for a drink?
- You're a mind reader.
- How about a little toast?
- Here's mud in your eye.
Don't be a bore, Norton.
There's a lady present.
Sorry.
Here's mud in your eye.
Oh, dear.
Where'd she go?
Hi there.
I love you.
Oh, my stars!
Where are you going, my little love bug?
Come back here.
There's been a ghastly mistake.
Dr Bombay.
Dr Bombay, my husband's going to be home any minute.
Right.
Goodbye.
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a cowardly doctor.
There you are, you gorgeous little witch.
And his friends!
I've got you now, my little pigeon.
I wonder if that's what they mean by "life, liberty and the happiness of pursuit" Esmeralda!
Esmeralda, will you please tell him I'm married?
She's married, but I'm not.
Come here, you little pigeon.
- I'm not even engaged.
- Oh, good for you.
Oh!
Hi, sweetheart.
You're early.
Come back here, you beautiful creature.
I'm not that early.
- Sam.
- Oh, dear.
Okay.
You want to play games, huh?
All right.
But I'm warning you.
I'm a very sore loser.
Where are you, my little pigeon?
- Mrs Stephens come through here?
- She went thataway.
- No.
She went thisaway.
- Sam, who is that guy?
- Well, you see - What is all this mess?
Our guests will be here in less than an hour.
- Now, have you flipped?
- Oh, dear.
Yes.
Excuse us, Esmeralda.
Dear.
He's a warlock that Dr Bombay thought might be attracted to Esmeralda, but he wasn't.
So the doctor made a love potion to get him interested, and it did.
- In me.
- I knew there was a logical explanation.
Sam, will you get that character out of this house right now?
He is out.
But I don't know for how long.
Larry's picking up the Meiklejohns at the airport and taking them to their hotel.
I'd better call the hotel and see if I can head them off.
That can't be Larry.
With the luck I've been having all day, it's got to be him.
I better do something about the mess in the kitchen just in case.
- Oh.
Mr Meiklejohn.
Mrs Meiklejohn.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
- How nice to see you.
I know we're a little early, but we decided to come here straight from the airport.
- I told you we should have called.
- Yes.
Stand back, Esmeralda.
I'm gonna have to speed things up a bit.
Esmeralda, would you mind putting the dip in that silver bowl - with some crackers around it and - Sam, come on.
The Meiklejohns will think we went out the back door.
Which may not be a bad idea.
- Why did Larry bring them over so early?
- Well, they had an argument on the plane, and she refused to stay over, so they cancelled their hotel reservations.
Looks like a jolly evening.
Well, I have to change.
Will you please turn around?
Sam, this is no time to be bashful.
Just go ahead.
- How do I look?
- Like a vision of loveliness.
Look, whatever you're selling, we don't want any.
- Now will you please blow?
- Oh, sure.
You have hurricane insurance?
- He didn't mean to be rude.
- Yes, I did.
Get lost.
I'll give you your choice.
Would you rather be a frog or a zebra?
Don't you dare lay a spell on him.
You'd make a wonderful aardvark.
- Norton, if you really care for me - Oh, I do.
I do.
Then you behave yourself and stay here in the kitchen.
Your every wish is my command.
- Esmeralda, may I have the clam dip?
- Anything you say.
Would you like to make us - a couple of drinks, sweetheart?
- Yeah.
Oh, Mr Meiklejohn, Mrs Meiklejohn, how nice to see you.
- Excuse me.
Have some clam dip.
- Thank you.
My dear, I do want to apologise.
After all, it wasn't my idea to barge in this early.
Sure.
Blame me.
Even though it's you who refuses to stay over.
I don't care to discuss it.
Well, Boston must be very nice this time of year.
Sure.
Nice and humid.
- I tell you.
I did not know that stewardess.
- I hardly think this is the place to discuss it.
But I am curious to know how she knew your first name.
I must have taken the trip a hundred times, and it's only logical I don't care to discuss it.
- Oh, this must be awfully boring for you.
- Oh, not at all.
I mean, sweetheart, don't you think you should freshen up their drinks?
- Mrs Meiklejohn?
- No, thank you.
- Mr Meiklejohn.
- Just warm up the ice cubes.
- I've only had one.
- And two doubles on the plane.
Wouldn't anyone like some clam dip?
George, inasmuch as you're going back tonight, maybe we could take a few minutes after dinner to discuss the renewal terms.
- I don't think that'd be fair to our hosts.
- Sure, it would.
I mean, wouldn't it, Darrin?
Oh, sure.
Sure.
I don't usually mix business with pleasure, but under the Isn't anyone gonna try the clam dip?
It's really the end.
- Oh.
Yeah.
I will.
- It does look good.
What is it?
Hi there.
What's the matter with you?
You're beautiful.
Did I tell you what happened to our neighbour Mrs Kravitz?
No, Sam.
What happened to our neighbour Mrs Kravitz?
Well, Mr Kravitz took her to her very first baseball game, and What are you doing all the way over there?
Will you stop acting like a sex maniac?
You're a handsome devil.
You know that?
Well, that's very flattering, but - I think I'll freshen that dip.
- Let me help you.
If I were your wife, I'd never let you out alone.
Well, that's very flattering too, but listen, I don't want to crowd you.
Why not?
Quite a kidder, isn't she?
I have every reason to be angry.
Do you think it was cricket just to take off and leave your friend behind?
Why not?
He knows his way home.
At any rate, I haven't the foggiest notion how the potion got into your dip.
You know, Doctor, you'd make a perfect stranger.
Darrin, please.
What about the antidote?
Listen, you two.
What's the idea of leaving me alone with - Hi.
- Evidently.
You two sure have a lot of help tonight.
Hey, what did you put in Mrs Meiklejohn's drink anyway?
- I beg your pardon?
- Larry, don't you understand?
She's just trying to get even with her husband because of that stewardess.
Sure.
And it won't hurt to humour her.
You're forgetting something.
We're here to humour him.
- And if she keeps on - Larry, where are you?
Hey!
Come back, honeybunch!
I say.
They've all gone amok, haven't they?
How long will it take to make the antidote?
It might be faster if I put a reverse spell on the potion.
- Where's the clam dip?
- Over there.
I may join him.
I could do with a swim myself.
Nothing.
Darrin, why don't you go out there and help Larry?
Right.
- I'm gonna get you.
- Mrs Meiklejohn, please.
Mrs Meiklejohn, I don't think Mr Meiklejohn would approve.
Oh.
Here, Mr Meiklejohn.
Let me help you.
- Please.
Will you please stop that!
- Don't go so fast.
I suppose Larry has told you how anxious we are to continue handling your account.
For the last time He has a funny way of showing it.
Oh, yes, here.
Cheers.
Oh, boy!
Some more clam dip.
Is it as good as it looks?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Esmeralda and Norton tasted it, and they loved it.
- Oh, that's great.
- In fact, they just left.
That's even greater.
- Here, Mr Meiklejohn.
Have some.
- Ladies first.
Sam, sit over here.
Oh, no, no, no.
You're not gonna get away from me again.
Here, here.
I made a fresh batch.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Oh, my goodness.
What's going on here?
- I haven't the vaguest idea.
George.
George, where have you been all this time?
Right here, honeybunch.
- Are you trying to start another argument?
- Why should I argue with my lovely wife?
- Oh.
I think I'll have some of that.
- No, you don't.
Pardon?
I mean, I want you to save your appetite for dinner, which will be ready in a few minutes.
Come along, sweetheart.
Darrin?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- Hey.
What's the matter?
You look worried.
- I am.
Meiklejohn just renewed his contract with us for five years.
Well, that's wonderful.
What's the problem?
Well, since Mr and Mrs Meiklejohn decided to turn the trip into a second honeymoon, he's been acting like a teenager.
He calls his wife three or four times a day, sends her flowers, talks about her incessantly.
Well, I'm sure she doesn't mind.
Sam, you and I both know he's under the influence of witchcraft.
Darrin, I have a surprise for you.
That love potion only lasts 24 hours.
You mean he really - I guess all he needed was a little push.
- Well, what do you know?
Sam, that was not funny.
So sue me.
It was worth it.
Come here.
