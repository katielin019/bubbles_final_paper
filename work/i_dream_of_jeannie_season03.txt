{START OF EPISODE 01}
We really should wait for Tony, sir.
He should be here any minute.
Major Nelson has exactly three minutes.
If he isn't here, we'll start the procedures without him.
Yes, sir.
Couldn't we delay it a little while, doctor?
Two minutes, Major Healey.
But, doctor    Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Good morning, master.
Uh, Jeannie, you let me oversleep.
I-I told you we were gonna have a dry run of a spaceshot today.
Well, I woke on time, but I I dreamed that we were married, and I could not resist going back for the honeymoon.
Get me to the base, would you, please?
Now?
Yes, now.
Oh, very well.
It's not like Tony to be late, sir.
Major, we're gonna start.
Oh, uh, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, would you like some breakfast, sir?
Five, four, three, two You're home, Sam.
This is Cap-Com Control signing off.
Yeah.
Perfect.
Hi, Tony.
Hello, major.
Take him down.
Oh, hello, doctor.
How'd it go at your end?
An unqualified success, Major Nelson.
Your protÃ©gÃ© is green for go for the real thing tomorrow.
I'm certain Sam appreciates your contribution.
Well, I didn't join the, uh, astronaut program to become a radio announcer, sir.
I was hoping NASA would put me in the driver's seat.
Well, I'm with Tony.
We're the senior astronauts on this project.
And who gets to make the first shot?
Sam.
I mean, it isn't fair.
Now, don't be bitter, gentlemen.
If you really wanted first crack at this mission, why, you  You should have been more selective in choosing parents.
It's all a matter of heredity.
Well done, Sam.
All right, uh, Sam, press the green one.
Hey.
Good boy.
Good boy, Sam.
There's something wrong with this.
I'm gonna have to check it.
I'm gonna have to get a technician to take a look at this panel.
Hurry up, will ya, Tony?
Everybody else has gone for lunch.
Master!
Oh!
Jeannie!
Oh, thank heavens.
Oh, for a minute, I thought that What are you doing here?
I told you never come to NASA.
Never.
But it is important, master.
You said I could come if it was an emergency.
Well, what happened?
What's the matter?
I got lonely.
You got lonely?
!
You got lonely?
!
Why do we not go to a movie this afternoon?
Because Roger and I have a lot of work to do.
Now, get out, and I mean it.
Now.
Hey!
Look what Sam's doing.
Yeah?
Oh, uh, S-Sam.
Sam, please, now, don't touch any of the buttons until I give you the orders, huh?
Red for red, and green for green, okay?
Don't worry.
He'll be all right when the time comes.
Yeah, but what good is it?
He can't make any decisions.
We might as well have a robot up there.
I will buy lunch.
I know a wonderful little restaurant along the banks of the Nile.
Really?
Well, I'm starved.
I Roger, we've got work to do.
Lots of work to do.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, I was Doctor.
Uh Insha'Allah, effendi.
Um who was that?
The water boy.
Yes.
Come along, Sam.
We have a lot of work to do.
Whew.
Was that not brilliant, master?
He did not suspect a thing.
No.
He probably just thought you were one of the regular, run-of-the-mill NASA Arabs.
Goodbye, Jeannie.
No lunch?
No lunch.
Dr. Bellows is expecting too much out of this.
What do you mean?
Even if Sam does his job properly, we're gonna get limited information.
What Orbiter 5 needs up there is a man.
Well let's stop dreaming and get back to work.
We don't have a man, we've got a monkey.
Master.
Jeannie, please.
Where shall I go?
Where does any woman go?
Spend the day at the beauty parlor.
Very well, master.
Jeannie.
Mm.
Yes, master?
Please.
Goodbye, master.
You've done very well this morning, Sam.
Here's a reward for you.
Now, Sam the next test we're gonna Sam?
Sam?
!
Look, I-I That wiring's loose.
I think we'd better get an electrician in here.
Uh I don't think we ought to fool around with it.
Hold on.
I got an idea.
Give me Give me the screwdriver, will ya?
Mm-hm.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
That was fast.
Um, there's something wrong with the signal switch.
Would you look at it, please?
Sure.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
Here's a nice banana for you.
Now, you've got to be in this room somewhere.
Yeah, you're new around here, aren't you?
Mm.
Hm?
Where?
Where are you from?
The Cameroons.
Equatorial West Africa.
That's where I was born and raised as a kid.
No kidding.
Yeah.
And then my My whole family got captured.
Captured?
Wire ends.
Sam is irreplaceable.
You are not.
I want you to find that chimp.
Oh, I will, general.
I will.
And I think I know just where to look.
I said to myself, if I were a chimpanzee, where would I go?
And what did you decide?
I'd go to where Major Nelson is.
Major Nelson?
Yes, sir.
My theory is that Sam has gone in search of his mother substitute.
And Tony Nelson is Sam's mother substitute.
That's right, general.
After all, Major Nelson has worked very closely with Sam.
Sam's animal instincts told him that he was being placed in jeopardy.
And he felt an overwhelming need for the warmth and comfort of the maternal bosom.
How does that sound to you, sir?
It sounds to me as though you've been seeing too many jungle pictures.
Find Sam.
Um I-I-is that gonna take you long, uh Sam.
Sam.
You wouldn't like another electrician to help you, would you?
I'm no electrician.
I'm a scientist.
A scientist, huh?
Yeah.
It's a beautiful success story.
I'm the first scientist in our family.
One of my brothers made it big in show business.
Maybe you saw him on The Jerry Lewis Show.
Mm, no, I I don't think I caught it.
Uh Y-you're gonna You're gonna be able to, uh, put that back together, aren't you?
Uh, will you excuse me, please?
Hello, Major Nelson here.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Huh?
Just a minute.
Y-you, uh You say Sam's escaped?
You think he's on his way over here.
Well, w-why?
Huh A mother what?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, sir.
Of course we'll keep our eyes open for him.
Right, sir.
Yeah.
Hey, uh, Dr. Bellows is on his way over here.
He thinks Sam is coming.
Don't let him get me.
I wanna stay here with you.
Now, wait a minute here.
Eh, would you get off, huh?
I don't wanna go back in that cage.
You know, look Get off, will you?
Nobody's gonna put you back in a cage.
What's the matter with you, Sam?
Sam.
That's Sam.
I know it's Sam.
Sam?
It can't be Sam.
Yeah-heh.
Uh, yes, it can be.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Why would Jeannie do a thing like that?
Why does she do anything?
Jeannie!
Don't let 'em take me.
He treated me like a monkey.
Yeah, but, Sam, you are a monkey.
Hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
Who are you calling a monkey?
Uh, Sam, I'm sorry about this, but you're just gonna have to become a chimpanzee again.
You wanna be a chimpanzee?
Be a chimpanzee.
I'm staying a man.
Eh, Sam.
This whole thing is a mistake.
Uh, uh, uh, uh So you see, a friend of mine, I have this   Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Can I help you?
Oh, I hope so.
My master sent me.
Uh, well, what exactly can we do for you?
Well I-I-I am not sure.
I've never been to a beauty parlor before.
You've never Just one minute.
I'll get Mr. Sidney, okay?
Mm.
Uh, good afternoon.
Oh.
I understand you've never been in a beauty salon before.
That is right.
What would you like?
Well, what do you have?
I'm glad you asked.
Uh, get ready for one super deluxe.
Right this way, please.
Sam, now Now Try Sam Uh, what I've been trying to say is that, uh, according to Darwin, it's gonna be several thousand years before you reach our level of development.
Uh Oh Sam, you You'd be Be much happier as a chimp.
Oh, yeah?
Have you ever seen a chimp driving around in a convertible with a blond.
Heh-heh.
I've got a mate you wouldn't believe.
Big, hairy Rrr.
He's coming.
I smell it.
You smell who?
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Don't go up there.
Any sign of Sam?
Oh, y-yeah.
Uh, no.
Nothing to talk about.
Nothing to talk about, sir.
Well, I have a general alarm out, and I've had the base sealed off.
Oh, he won't get away.
After all, how far can a chimpanzee get before someone sees him.
Well, I I think I can, uh, guarantee he'll be up in that capsule tomorrow.
Yeah, he's gone!
Who's gone?
Well, Sam.
We know that, major.
That's why I put out a general alarm.
You'd better pull yourself together.
Yes.
Come on, let's go.
Wait, where?
Where?
Come on.
And you have a lovely complexion.
It's hard to believe you've never been in a beauty salon.
Well, I used to go to the Roman baths a lot.
The Roman baths?
Yes.
Nero's wife and I used to go every Saturday morning before the chariot races.
Oh.
Oh, I hope my master likes the way I look.
Oh-ho-ho.
I'm sure he will.
There we go.
What?
Madam.
Oh.
This isn't beauty parlor.
Sam.
Oh, Sam.
Sam.
Sam!
What are we gonna do, Tony?
I'm afraid he's gotten away.
Oh, how could he have gotten away?
There's There's nowhere to go.
There's guards all over the place.
Yeah.
I know.
We'll use psychology.
Think like a chimp.
No, I'm serious.
Now, if you were a chimpanzee, and And you wanted to hide, where would you go?
Well, I don't know.
The first place I'd go is up a tree.
Now, come on down, Sam.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I'm staying here till that missile goes up.
How would you like a banana?
Or some peanuts?
I'll get you a bag of peanuts.
What do ya say?
Major Nelson.
Yes?
Would you mind telling me what you're doing?
Uh Oh, I was speaking to the gardener, sir.
He's pruning the trees.
Well, I suggest that you get on with your search for Sam.
That's what I was doing, sir.
I thought perhaps the gardener had seen him.
Have you?
A simple yes or no would have been sufficient.
Help these days is impossible.
Now what?
I mean, even if we get him down, how are we gonna turn him back into a chimpanzee again?
Yeah.
Shh.
Be quiet.
Uh, Jeannie.
Jeannie what?
Jeannie'll change him back.
That's the answer Would you?
But Jeannie isn't here.
Well, she will be.
Whenever I'm in trouble, I just concentrate on her, and she comes to me.
Now, I gotta concentrate.
Ahem.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Would you like some coffee?
I cannot hear you.
Would you like some coffee?
Oh, yes, I would.
Jeannie.
Yeah, it's no use, Roge.
You mean your friend's not gonna change me back again.
Yeah, that's right.
Come on, let's go.
Wait a minute.
Hey!
Wait for me.
Do you hear something?
No.
I thought I heard someone calling my name.
May I use your phone?
Oh, yes.
There's one in the other room.
Oh.
I'll get it.
Please do not bother.
The first thing I'm gonna do is move in with you.
I'm a lot of laughs once you get to know me.
Boy, we'll really be swinging.
At the end of a noose.
What?
Nothing.
Sam, you wouldn't want to hold up the space program, would you?
What?
Who, me?
I'm all ready to go up.
All you have to do is call Dr. Bellows and tell him who I am.
He's got you there.
Hey.
What do you say we all go nightclubbing?
Someplace where they got a lot of swinging chicks.
Zowie.
That's probably Dr. Bellows.
Give him my love.
Hello.
Major Nelson here.
Hello, master.
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Hello, uh Hello, major.
Major?
This is Jeannie, master.
Yes, I know.
You know that package you exchanged for me?
Package?
Oh.
You must mean Sam.
I knew that would make you happy, master.
Heh-heh.
Well, happy's not really the word for it.
Yeah, I'd like you to take it back.
Oh, but I thought that Yeah, look Jeannie, I'd like you to take it back right now.
If that is what you wish.
That's what I wish.
Ohh!
Hello?
I don't think we'll ever get this place back together again.
What did you say?
Sam.
Hey, Tony, it's that Jeannie's turned him back again.
Oh, you're not gonna do any nightclubbing after all.
You're going up in space tomorrow.
Not if I can help it.
Say on him it looks good.
See you later.
Tony?
Is that you Tony?
Don't worry about a thing.
I'm gonna sneak you out of here.
Sam!
Where?
You found Sam.
Oh, this Found Sam.
Oh, that's, uh That's not Sam, sir.
Then who is it?
Who is that?
Oh, that's, uh That's Ernie.
It's his cousin.
Used to hang around at the zoo, and Now, don't be ridiculous, Major Healey.
There's only one chimpanzee around here.
Why Besides, I know Sam when I see him.
Here we are.
Come along, Sam.
Whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.
You can't take Sam with you, sir.
And why not?
Well, he's just a baby.
Oh, Major Healey.
Sam has been trained for this mission.
Where's Major Nelson?
I-I think he's at the end of his rope.
Send him to me as soon as you find him.
This mission is going up on schedule.
Sir?
Oh.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
There.
That looks truly elegant.
No.
Thank you very much but I think I like it better the other way.
There.
Do you not think this is bet?
Mr. Sidney.
Yes, General Wisten, that's right.
Sam is right here in my office.
And he's in fine shape for his little trip into space.
Oh.
Don't worry, sir.
Hm-hm.
I intend to keep Sam here right with me every second until blastoff.
Thank you, general.
That's very kind of you.
Well, it was just a question of understanding animal psychology.
Yes.
The animal mind is so different  Dr. Bellows.
Are you there?
General Wisten I've just discovered the missing link.
Oh, excuse me.
I'll see ya later, honey.
I gotta visit a sick friend.
Well How you doing, buddy boy?
I know just how you feel.
I'm up to here with them bananas myself.
Hey, you know this evolution you was telling me about.
I kind of like it.
Master.
Master, I'm home.
Jeannie!
Oh, Major Healey.
Oh.
Where's Major Nelson?
Where?
You're asking me where Major Nelson is?
He's a monkey, that's where he is.
I do not understand.
Yeah, well, you blinked cockeyed and turned him into a chimpanzee.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
Wait for me!
Wait.
Oh, wait.
Wait!
I'd help you out, buddy boy, but I have this date tonight with a brunette.
This is the life.
I'm taking her up to our place for a drink.
Good luck, Tony.
Oh.
Hi.
How's tricks?
I will show you.
Oh.
Oh.
Jeannie.
Oh, master.
You are not angry with me?
Uh Angry with you?
You're the most beautiful person I've ever seen.
You're the most beautiful person I've ever seen in my life.
Where have ya been?
I went to the beauty parlor, where you sent me.
Why did you not call me?
Why didn't I call you?
Mm.
Uh Uh Excuse me.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Uh, I'm afraid you're not gonna be able to keep that date tonight.
You're not really dressed for it, you know.
Sam.
You may not believe this but I envy you.
I really do.
You're gonna g Go up there and have a wonderful trip.
And we're gonna get you down safely.
Thattaboy.
Oh.
Oh.
Roger.
Roger.
He's gotta be going crazy.
Roger.
I gotta find Roger.
There you are, love bug.
Oh, yeah.
Good one.
This is the most miraculous thing I've ever seen.
Oh.
If this is a joke of some kind General.
I'm telling you, I saw him write that with my own eyes.
Well I'll go down in history.
Ask him to write something.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Sam.
Uh, uh This is General Wisten.
He would, uh, like to see you write something.
Now, it doesn't have to be anything fancy.
Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
You really believe this.
Oh, you'll see it for yourself, general.
Now here we are.
"The Gettysburg Address".
Written by a monkey.
You almost had it right, doctor.
It was dictated by a monkey.
Psychiatrists!
Where did I go wrong?
This is Control to Orbiter 5.
Control to Orbiter 5.
Can you hear me, Sam?
Good.
You're doing fine.
Just Just relax.
I want you to press the green button, Sam.
The green button on the panel board.
He did it.
I knew he could.
Heh.
All right, you're doing great.
Now, Sam, I want you to press the red button.
Yeah.
Excellent.
All right now, Sam, you You're just doing fine.
I want you to press the red and the green button at the same time.
Red and green, Sam.
Green and red, Sam.
Red and green?
Are you kidding?
I've only got two hands, you know.
It's do this, do that.
Do you know the trouble with you human beings?
You're never satisfied.
Why can't you make up your mind about?
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
I will.
Yes, you know I will.
All right, give my love to dad and sis.
Yes, okay, bye.
Was that your mother again, master?
Uh-huh.
The usual thing, you know.
Stay out of drafts, marry a nice girl.
I am a nice girl, master.
Yes, I know you are, Jeannie.
Somehow I I don't think you're exactly what my mother has in mind.
My family never calls me.
Do you know, master, I have not seen my sister Jeannie for over 200 years.
Jeannie?
Your sister's name is Jeannie?
Oh, yes, we are all Jeannies.
No kidding.
How do they tell you apart?
Oh, you would have no difficulty telling my sister Jeannie from me, master.
She's very different.
Well, if you miss her so much, why don't you call her?
Only, uh, reverse the charges, huh?
I'll be home early.
I want to get to bed early.
Don't plan anything fancy, huh?
Have a good day, master.
Okay.
"Reverse the charges".
Well, I will do better than that.
Oh.
Yes, Master Poopsie, what is it this time?
Jeannie.
Do you not recognize me?
It is your sister, Jeannie.
Well, careful, careful, darling, my hair.
Well, what am I doing here?
Well, my master was talking about his family so I began to think, we had not seen each other in such a very long time and so well here you are.
Well, frankly, darling, I'm grateful.
Your homey, little impulse may just have saved me from a long, dull summer.
I don't know what your master is like, but mine's a drag.
Oh, not my Major Nelson.
He is a wonderful man.
For starters, he's 80, and he's got 36 wives.
Well, my Major Nelson is not married.
But I am hopeful.
So, he keeps me in that stuffy, old bottle all day long until the ashtrays in one of his limousines gets filled up.
And then it's zap, out of the bottle.
Poof, a new limousine.
And squish, back in the old jug again.
I'm so bored I could scream.
Well, my master hardly let's me give him anything.
In fact, he gets angry if I try to give him a present.
Well, if he doesn't want anything, what do you do all day long?
Oh, we go places and do things together.
In fact, I am hardly ever in my bottle.
JEANNIE'S  Is this your Major Nelson, darling?
Is he not beautiful?
Mmmm.
Groovy.
But he sure could provide you with a better bottle.
This is pretty tiny.
Oh, no, it is quite comfortable.
Oh, don't kid me, sis.
You must be cramped in there.
Oh, no, truly, I will show you.
See?
It is most cozy.
Glad you like it, darling, because from now on it's home sweet home.
What are you doing?
You let me out of here.
And don't worry about your Major Nelson, darling.
I'm going to take good care of him.
Ugh.
Hello?
Anybody home?
Well.
Master, darling, Oh, hi, Jeannie you're home.
Well, that's what I call starting the day off right.
You're not I I always knew I had sneaky charm, it just takes a A year or two to sink in.
Help, Major Healey!
Let me out!
You are an imposter.
Let me out!
Don't look now but I think somebody's in your bottle.
Oh, it's just the cleaning lady, sweetheart.
Pay no attention.
It is me, Major Healey.
It is me, Jeannie.
Oh, let me out.
Let me out.
Wait a minute.
If you're Jeannie then who are you?
I'm glad you asked, darling.
Hey, wait a minute.
Whoa!
Boy, she sure has a spooky idea of a practical joke.
Oh!
Going south?
Hey, Jeannie, I'm home.
Yummy.
Master, I'm so happy to finally see you.
What's gotten into you anyway?
Oh, nothing.
Don't I always kiss you when you come home at night?
Yeah, well not that way.
What a waste.
Look.
Restrain yourself, please.
What's for dinner?
Well, that's up to you, baby.
Where's the best place in town for a nice, thick Chateaubriand with bÃ©arnaise sauce?
The kitchen.
Look, I'm bushed.
Anything in the refrigerator will be fine.
Master, darling, we're going out to eat.
Oh, no, we're not.
I want you to promise me never to do this sort of thing again.
Cherries jubilee, my utter favorite.
I thought you hated cherries.
Well, I mean, my new favorite.
Jeannie, I don't know what you're trying to prove but this new style of yours has got to quit.
Oh, but that's what you need, master, a new style.
And a brand-new Jeannie to go with it.
And there are going to be some changes made, darling.
You're really going to swing.
I'm going home.
And so are you.
Home?
Darling, the evening is young.
Pay the check.
Pay the check?
Where will we go dancing?
Jeannie, I don't know if you've forgotten, But I'm the guy that found you in that bottle on the beach.
I give the orders around here.
We are going home.
No, no, darling.
It's all in the hips.
Watch.
I'm watching, I'm watching.
You could get arrested for that.
For this?
Oh, darling, you should see me when I really move.
Can't we get outta here, please?
Oh, I dig.
Like you say, you're the master, darling.
Cha-cha-cha.
Huh?
Oh.
Jeannie, can't Can't we go home?
I'm I'm due at the base in two hours.
Oh, not yet, darling.
I want to see the sun rise above Sugarloaf.
Uh, well, all right, you You can stay here and do all the dancing you want to.
I'm going home.
Sugarloaf?
Where are we?
Brazil.
Huh?
All right, Major Nelson, I want your reactions to yesterday's simulator flight, exactly as you remember them.
Now, uh, Major Nelson?
Wake up, major.
Oh.
Dr. Bellows, what are you doing here, sir?
This happens to be my office.
Oh, of course it is.
I'm sorry, sir.
I I didn't get much sleep last night.
Should we get started with the de-briefing.
Uh, fine.
Now, according to Paragraph 20 Major Nelson.
Wake up!
Tony?
Tony?
Are you in there?
I've gotta talk to you.
Major Healey, help!
Let me out.
Jeannie, is that you?
Oh, it is terrible.
My own sister, she has locked me in my bottle.
Oh, where is she?
She is with my master.
Oh, please, help me!
Oh, don't worry, don't worry.
Old Roge will come to the rescue.
Please, hurry.
Okay, here I come.
Hi.
Bye.
Comfy, sister dear?
Okay, I wanna talk to you.
What have you done with my master?
Where is he?
Oh, cool it, sis.
We've got business to discuss.
Master?
Master?
Relax.
He's at his little dullsville job.
His job is not dullsville.
I could make him the swingingest master going.
You don't appreciate his potential.
I like him the way he is.
Mm-hmm.
Well, I see him in a white dinner jacket with a daiquiri in one hand and an expensive cigar in the other.
Uh, I'm fine now, sir.
Good.
Now, if we Major Nelson, what are you wearing?
Wearing, sir?
Well, my uniform.
You!
You want to change him.
Well, my master and I are perfectly happy and And I I think he looks handsome in his uniform.
That's a uniform?
Yes, sir.
Oh, I  I'm sorry, major.
Uh, for a moment, I could have sworn that you were wearing a dinner jacket and smoking a cigar.
I don't smoke, sir.
I didn't let you out of the bottle to argue with you.
I've got it all figured out.
You're going to take my place back in Baghdad, keeping old Ibn Grandpa supplied in limousines.
I will do no such thing.
While I stay here and teach that gorgeous hunk of a sow's ear what life is all about.
How dare you suggest such a thing.
I What makes you think I will allow you to steal my master?
Oh, let's face it, sis.
Your Major Nelson has jet-set potential, and you're a horse-and-buggy genie.
He ought to have a string of ponies.
May we get along with the debriefing, sir.
Uh?
!
Oh!
I'm s Major, put down that polo mallet.
What polo mallet, sir?
Don't make me get rough, sis.
You'll like the old coot.
He's, uh, just your style.
Well, I would not trade my master for 50 sheiks.
Oh, now, how do you know, you haven't even seen him yet.
He can be pretty, uh, regal in his burnoose and his flowing, white robes.
Do, uh, I look all right to you?
Oh, fine, fine, sir.
Well, a second ago, I I thought you were standing over me with a polo mallet.
Uh, look at my eyes, do they look clouded or anything?
No, sir, you look just the same.
Almost.
Well Well, okay, sis, if you feel that way about it.
After all, I only want you to be happy.
We are sisters, aren't we?
Ã bientÃ´t.

She's got me trapped in the bottle.
She's gonna take me back with her.

Master?
Better luck next time.
She tricked me with his voice.
Ooh!
Ha, ha!
You can forget about your Major Nelson, sweetheart.
You won't be seeing him again.
Well, uh, perhaps it was just a An hallucination, sir.
Psychiatrists don't have hallucinations.
You know as well as I do that I was sitting here in long, flowing robes and a burnoose.
Wasn't I?
Whatever you say, sir.
Well, that'll be all now, major.
We'll finish this tomorrow, and, uh, you won't, uh, mention this to anyone, will you?
Of course not, sir.
Thank you.
I won't forget this.
Neither will I.  Jeannie!
Oh, Jeannie.
Oh, thank heavens you're all right.
Your sister's more powerful than you are, huh?

Okay?
Okay, sugarplum.
Send me someplace warm, huh?
I catch cold easy.
Someplace with a beach.

You don't know a good thing when you see it, do you, darling?
All right, Jeannie, I hate to do this.

Oh.
Are you trying to get away from someone?
That's right, Jeannie.
Shh!
I will help you.
Who are you trying to get away from?
You!
You mean you do not want me to go with you?
Well, that's the general idea, Jeannie.
Look, I have a very important press conference, and well, I just don't want you to attract any attention.
Why don't you go to D-Diamond Head or something, huh?
Because I want to be with you.
I will not attract any attention, master.
Oh, come on.
Oh, I promise.

Major.
Uh, this is Miss Jeannie.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Why don't you tilt your hat back a little, major, and we'll get a few pictures.
Oh, I will stay in the corner like a small little mouse.
Oh.
Good girl.
Boy, that's an interesting pin.
It must be a copy of the King Tut scarab.
A copy?
Huh!
This is the original.
The original?
Why, that's worth a half million dollars.
Let's get this picture here.
A half a million dollars?
Is it true?
Can't believe it.
Yes.
"I will sit in the corner like a little mouse" I am sorry, master.
Jeannie, why did you have to wear that pin?
I wanted to look nice for you.
Oh.
I see.
Did that thing really cost a half a million dollars?
I do not know.
King Tut did not say.
Did King Tut really give you this?
Oh, yes.
Oh, he was quite fond of me.
He was a very nice man, you know.
Bit of an egomaniac.
I mean, most people are satisfied with a little tiny tombstone.
But King Tut had to have the biggest in whole land, the pyramid, a golden coffin I know.
I know, I know.
I am sorry if I upset you, master.
That's all right.
I guess I'm just being overcautious.
There's no harm done.
No, master.
Excuse me.
I want you back here in exactly 17 minutes.
Yes, Mr. Vanderhaven.
Don't keep me waiting.
No, Mr. Vanderhaven.

Would you care to have another one, sir?
No!
I don't want anything else.
All I want to do is get out of this freezing climate.
Freezing, sir?
But we're in Hawaii.

There's over a half a million dollars ready to be taken.
But we'll never get away with it.

Do what?
Steal it?

Yeah.
Who's talking about stealing?
She's going to give it to us.
Why would she do that?

Yachts.
Girls.
How much we got in the bank?
Twenty-five hundred dollars.
Get it out.
What for?
Bait.
We're going into town this afternoon for three things: A real-estate broker, a jeweler and a lumberyard.
Real-estate broker a jeweler and a lumberyard?
I'm sorry I was detained, but those overseas calls are a nuisance, aren't they?
Well, it's a pleasant place to get them.
And what would be more pleasant is for me to show you two around Oahu tomorrow.
Oh!
Oh, thank you, Mr. Vanderhaven, but I have quite a lot of work to do tomorrow.
Oh, that's a pity.
Uh, are you free?
Am I free?
Well, uh I am free.
Oh, good, good.
I'll, uh I'll pick you up in the morning, and I'll show you around the islands.
Oh, thank you.
Well, thank you.
Believe me, major this is going to be a rewarding experience.
Twenty-three, 24, 25.
The boys will never believe this, Mr. Hinkey.
Yeah?
May I ask what you want this land for?
Is this in confidence?
Of course.
It's for the president's anti-poverty program.
Oh.
Uh, good morning, miss.
Good morning.
Uh, where shall we go first, sir?
Oh, I am so excited.
I want to be taken everywhere.
Don't worry.

Yes, my dear, I have a fleet of them.
Heh.
Now make Jeannie comfortable, take her into the helicopter.
Mr. Vanderhaven.
Yeah, that is correct.

How much is a half-hour ride?
Fifty dollars.
Give me $11 worth.
Go ahead.
Oh, look down there!
That is Diamond Head!
Is it not lovely?
Oh!
There is the Punchbowl.

I wish Major Nelson were along.
Honolulu is so beautiful from the air.
Are the guards off duty, Edward?
Uh.
They They must be at lunch, sir.
All right.
Open the gate.
Open the gate.
Yes, sir.
And then I'll I'll help the lady down.
You help me down.
I'll help you down.
Step right this way, Jeannie.

That's fine.
Walk right in here.
This is my pride and joy, this piece of land.
Would you like to see it?
Oh, I would love to.
Well, fine.
Let's go.
Why do all the signs say "danger" and "keep off"?
Well I'm afraid I can't discuss it now.
Even with you.
Heh-heh.
Step right up.
Oh!
This is so wild and beautiful!
Yes.
It's very relaxing.
Heh-heh.
In fact, the real-estate broker that I bought it from told me that there's not another beach like this on the island.
Oh, it would be a beautiful place to build a home.
Oh, yes, indeed.
A great place for somebody who wanted to rest.
Who wanted to get away from all the The pressure of being in space all the time.
Like Major Nelson.
Yes.
Like Major Nelson.
Oh.
He would adore this.
I'm sorry, dear, it's not for sale.
Oh.
Look how white the sand is.
It is lovely.
Yeah, they They don't make sand like this anymore.
Isn't it beautiful?
Oh, yes.
All over.
Oh!
This looks like a diamond.
Shh!
Not so loud.
You mean it is a diamond?
You have stumbled on my secret.
This beach is full of diamonds.
I did not know they had diamonds in Hawaii.
Sh.
They do have diamonds in Hawaii.
Why you think they call this Diamond Head?
Oh.
Jeannie, look.
Look at that diamond.
Oh.
This is why you have the The guards and the gate and the signs Shh.
I was hoping it wouldn't leak out.
I Oh.
Look at that color.
Eddie, have them clean this beach.
Yes, Mr. Vanderhaven.
This beach hasn't been cleaned since yesterday.
The tide is so high, it keeps washing the diamonds ashore.
That is why you do not wish to sell this land.
Well, I Like to say that money isn't everything.
Jeannie, I I thought if it would make you and Major Nelson very happy, you could have the land, I'd give it to you.
You are going to let me have it?
I'm tempted.
Oh!
That would be won No good.
Why not?
Tsk.
He will never allow me to do anything for him.
Oh, my dear.
This wouldn't cost you anything.
It would not?
No.
I'd give it to you for free.
Sit right down.
Oh.
Thank you.
That's fine, Jeannie.
Get the motor running.
Yes, Mr. Vanderhaven.
Now I'll show you how the whole thing will work.
You pay for the land, and you'll get your money back on the diamonds.
That's how simple it is.
You are right.
That way it would not cost anyone anything.
How much money would you like for the land?
Ooh.
I never gave it a thought, because money doesn't mean anything That's a beautiful scarab you're wearing.
Oh.
Would you take the scarab for the land?
I guess so, if I was persuaded.
Oh, thank you!
Oh.
Be careful.
It's the The diamond.
There's another one there.
Oh.
No, no.
Keep it, keep it, dear.
There's more where that came from.
Oh, Jeannie, I can just picture Major Nelson relaxing in the lanai of his beautiful home that he'll build here.
Oh-ho-ho.
Major Nelson will be so thrilled.
Yeah.
We're all going to be very thrilled.
Heh.
Uh, here is the deed to the land.
Oh, thank you!
The, uh  Let's get the pin.

Let's Come on.
Charles!
Oh, there you are.
Where have you been?
Eh Sightseeing.

I can't stand these crummy cigars.
What?
And I'm not crazy about you either.
Yeah You gone out of your?
Have you lost your senses?
Is that any way to talk to a sick man?
You're not sick.
You're a hypochondriac.
I've had five years of cleaning up after you, being yelled at, watching you wheel and deal and cheat people.
Well, let me tell you something, Mr. Vanderhaven.
I've been doing a little wheeling and dealing myself, and I'm quitting!
You are not quitting, you're fired!
Fired?
I had you in my will for $10,000.
Peanuts, pal!
Peanuts.
I am raising it to $50,000!
Fifty thousand?
Then I'm cutting you out of my will!
All right!

I may be in the market.
Heh.
Keep warm, you old crook.
Master.
Oh.
Oh.
What is it?
Master, I have the most exciting surprise for you.
Now I thought you were out touring the island with Mr. Vanderhaven.
You now own the most beautiful beach in "Ohooha".
No, it's "Oahu".
And you are going to build a beautiful home there and sit under the palm trees, and eat the coconuts as they fall.
Mm, Jeannie, I told you, whenever I wanted land I'd buy it myself.
Oh, but you do not have to buy it, master.
This land did not cost anything.
How'd you get it?
Hm.
Oh, I was very clever.
How'd you get it?
I was much smarter than Mr. Vanderhaven.
And he is the richest man in the whole world.
How'd you get it?
Hm.
All I had to do was to give him my scarab, and he gave me that.
Two acres of sand for For a jewel worth a half a million dollars?
Oh, but it is not just sand, master.
It is covered with diamonds.
It's covered with diamonds?
Yes.
Your land is full of them.
Hundreds are washed ashore from the big volcano.
And that is why it is called Diamond Head.
Who told you that?
Mr. Vanderhaven.
Hm.
I have really done it this time, have I not, master?
You sure have.
You've been taken by the greatest con artist in the world.
Con artist?
Yeah, Jeannie, there aren't any diamonds in Hawaii.
Oh, but you are wrong, master.
Heh.
I picked these up off your beach myself.
Oh, Jeannie.
These are probably just industrial diamonds that he scattered on the bea You've been taken by the oldest trick in the book.
Oh, no.
Oh, yeah.
No!
Oh, my scarab.
Oh, King Tut will be furious with me.
Yeah.
Well, I will call the police and tell them exactly what happened.
Yeah, listen, Jeannie, uh, why don't you do that.
Uh, you call the police, and they'll wanna know who you are and where you're from.
And you'll say you're a genie.
Yes.
And you come out of a bottle.
That is right.
And they'll put us all away.
But what shall I do, master?
Nothing.
Oh, but I must do some No, absolutely noth Maybe this will be a lesson to you.
Tsk.
Yes, master.
Mm.
Well, you didn't come off too badly.
I mean, you got three diamonds out of it.
Yes.
At least I got the diamonds out of it.
Yeah.
Well.

I wanted to speak to you about our land.
Oh, no.
You'll have to talk to my lawyer.
Now, we We have an ironclad deal.
If you have any complaints I did not come here to complain.
I came here to thank you.

Yes!
I have just come from my beach.
You did not tell me how large the diamonds were.

T Trucks?
Truckloads of Of diamonds?
It was very generous of you.
Jeannie, you, uh You can't have that land.
Why not?
Because this There's a curse on it.
There's a curse of the ancient gods of the volcanoes.
The Maman Doodan Dun curse.
Well, I I do not believe in curses.
Aw, y-you're a brave girl, and I would never forgive myself if I let anything happen to you.
Oh, but really Now don't argue.
We can't take any chances.

Jeannie.
Hello, Charles.
Hello, miss.
Yes, uh, ahem, Charles is a terrible scoundrel, but he's an excellent worker.
You know, I'm so thankful that the Honolulu police turned him over to me.
Impersonating someone else is a prison offense, isn't it, Charles?
Yes, Mr. Vanderhaven.
But Charles likes living the life of luxury.
Uh, don't you, Charles?
Yes, sir.
When you've cleared away the dishes, you can clean up the galley.
Yes, sir.
And then press all of my clothes.
Yes, sir.
After that, you can, uh You were wrong, master.
Yeah?
About what?
You said he was the greatest con artist in the world.
Yeah?

And it looks as if it will land right on target.
Well, we can all breathe a sigh of relief now because everything seems to be A-okay here as astronauts Tony Nelson and Roger Healey chalk up another successful U.S. space mission.
This one went off without a hitch from start to finish.
Later we'll be seeing actual films of Major Nelson's walk in space.
MAN : There goes the capsule into the water now.
Less than two miles from the recovery ship's position.
Helicopters are on their way to pick them up.
And in just a few minutes, we will give you your first look at the returning astronauts.
Mmm!
I cannot wait!
Unfasten your seat belts, ladies and gentlemen.
We're home.
On our next flight, let's ask for a stewardess.
Welcome home, master.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
If you do not know, I must be doing it wrong.
You've gotta get outta here!
They're gonna open up the capsule.
Not for a minute.
Look.
Will you, Jeannie?
Cut it out, will you?
MAN : The helicopters are approaching the capsule.
And soon now the divers will be lowered into the water.
Hey, look at that.
That's us.
Oh, I missed you so much, master.
Well, I missed you too.
Let's talk about it some other time.
Will you go home now?
They're here.
Everything all right in there?
Oh, yes, everything is lovely!
Man, they've been up too long.
Master, what time are we supposed to be at the press banquet tonight?
Well, the dinner starts at 7, but Uh, we're not gonna be there, Jeannie.
You're not going.
No, uh-uh.
One blink from you and they'd put me back up in space permanently.
But, master Master, please.
What if I promise from this moment on not to use any of my power?
Ahem.
You'd forget.
Oh, no, I would not.
I put my, uh, briefcase around here someplace.
I Please, master, I would not forget.
You see.
Huh?
I forgot.
Oh, but I would not this evening.
I would be very careful No, I'm sorry, Jeannie.
It just wouldn't work out.
Honestly.
Uh, you and I will have dinner together tomorrow night.
Just the two of us, okay?
Very well, master.
I'll see you later.
Wait, master!
Jeannie, I'm late.
Master, I have a wonderful idea.
Yeah?
What if I transferred my power for 24 hours?
Then you would not have to worry about me tonight.
Transferred your power?
Uh, could you do that?
Oh, of course.
Yeah?
I will show you.
There.
It is done.
Are you sure?
Oh, yes, master.
I will prove it to you.
I will try to blink you to work.
Okay.
Well, I'm still here.
Okay, young lady.
You You got a deal.
You got a deal.
Oh, thank you, master!
I can't tell you how relieved I am not to have to worry about you tonight.
Aw.
See you then.
Wait until my master finds out who I have transferred my power to.
Mmm.
Having a little trouble, Pedro?
Heh.
No, SeÃ±or Nelson.
I'm having a lot of trouble.
This mower, she no good no more.
Yeah, well, keep trying.
It'll start.
You're right!
Yeah, well, from the sound of it, it's more powerful than my car.
Yeah.
Help!
Help!
Stop!
Stop!
Uh, well, hang on just a second.
Let me see.
It's, uh, Colonel Cochran.
He has a couple of aunts in from Denver, and they wanna meet some real live astronauts.
Wants to have lunch with us in the commissary.
No, thanks.
Um, I'm sorry, sir, uh, I don't think we can make it today.
Yeah Well, we're really up to our ears in paperwork.
Yeah.
What happened?
I don't know.
It's the craziest thing I've ever see No, oh, not Not you, colonel.

Uh, I'm sorry we can't come.
Roger and I send our apologies.

You noticed that too, sir.
Major, why are you up to your ears in papers?
Well, uh, do, uh?
We, uh  We're cleaning out the files, sir.
The window was open, and it blew all the papers all over.
Yeah, that's right.
We're 40 feet below ground level.
There are no windows here.
The air conditioner Uh, no, actually, what Uh, please.
What do you suppose really happened?
Jeannie, that's what happened.
Let's get outta here.
You told me that she gave up her power for 24 hours.
Yeah, but she lied.
And just for that, I'm not gonna take her tonight.
She's gonna be pretty upset.
She's gonna be upset?
Look at this mess.
Aw, don't worry, I'll help you with it.
Thanks, Roge, you're a brick.
Roger?
Roger, is this you?
Roge?
Speak to me, will ya?
Major Nelson.
Yes?
Who are you talking to?
Uh, oh, no No one, sir.
No one.
Nothing.
Um You were talking to this brick.
That'd be ridiculous, sir.
Oh, would it?
It's just a normal, everyday, run-of-the-mill brick.
It's What happened to Major Healey?
Major who?
Oh, Major Healey.
Oh, yeah, he was around here some I I'll see you both in my office in 10 minutes.
Dr. Bellows?
Uh, yes?
May I have my brick?
Oh, yes.
Here we are.
There's no need to get so excited.
After all, it's only a brick, major, you said so yourself.
Uh, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
But I need it as a paperweight for all the paper because of the wind and the window.
You know.
No, I don't know.
But I will, major.
I will.
All right, Jeannie, now that is enough.
I want Roger back in his original form.
You sure are cute, Roge.
Jeannie, I want him back the way he was a few minutes ago.
Oh, hi, Tony, what happened?
You were a baby.
I mean recently.
Well, Jeannie turned you into a brick.
A what?
Would you get down, please?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Yeah Turned me into a brick?
That's right.
And I've had it, man.
Look at this place.
Will you just look at it?
I've had it!
Right up to Well, we've done that.
Jeannie, I want this place cleaned up.
Well, one thing about Jeannie, she doesn't do things halfway, does she?
I don't know what's gotten into her.
Uh Jeannie, I want this equipment back right now.
Ow!
Boy, she is playful today, isn't she?
Jeannie, would you please go home and stop this?
You know, this is not like her, Roger.
She was really Had her heart set on On going to that dinner tonight.
Jeannie!
Or maybe you scared her into going home.
Huh?
Oh     Major Nelson's residence.
Uh, Jeannie?
Oh, master, I am so glad that you called.
I did not want to disturb you at work, and I You wouldn't wanna disturb me at work?
What have you been doing?
Well, I have been cooking.
And, you know, I have discovered that without my power I am a terrible cook.
Jeannie, look I have ruined three cakes.
Tsk.
I am sorry, master.
You made me a promise, Jeannie.
I know.
Wait until you see the dress I am going to wear tonight.
Hmm.
I am afraid I had to buy it at a department store.
Well, you can just take it back because you're not going tonight.
But you promised that you would take me with you tonight.
Yeah, on condition that you wouldn't use your magic, remember?
I remember, and I have not Place has been a disaster area all morning.
Now, no more tricks, you understand?
Master?
Master?
Master!
Ooh!
Disaster area?
Oh!
You were You were kinda rough on her, weren't you?
Sometimes you have to be, Roge.
That's the only way she'll understand.
Yeah.
Boy, imagine her turning me into a brick.
Whew.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, it's It's amazing, a girl have all that wonderful power and have absolutely no idea how to use it constructively.
Run out of gas, will ya!
?
It is out of gas!
Look out!
I could solve the problems of the whole world.
What?
Oh, I was just thinking out loud.
If I had Jeannie's power, I could solve the problems of the whole world.
There's probably nothing I couldn't do.
Yeah, a chateau with a swimming pool and a lot of beautiful girls in bikinis sitting around it.
That's not exactly what I had in mind.
You stick to your dreams, and I'll stick to mine.
It's gonna be a scorcher today, you know that?
I wish it would rain.
Ah, not a chance, the weatherman says it It's raining.
It couldn't be raining.
The sun's out.
It's probably one of those freak tropical storms, huh?
Yeah.
Major Nelson.
Oh, hi, doctor.
We were just on our way over to see you.
What?
It's raining on you.
Yes, sir.
Well, yes, it's raining on everybody.
Well, I Well, almost everybody.
This is extraordinary.
All right, gentlemen.
Now, I just want you to say anything that comes into your mind.
I'd like to get outta here.
I beg your pardon.
Well, you said, say the first thing that came to my mind.
No one's going anywhere until I get a satisfactory explanation.
Uh, well, there's really nothing to explain, sir.
We Uh, this morning, I found you literally up to your ears in paper.
Oh, yes, well, I, uh We explained that.
Roger said the wind, remember?
Major, there was no wind.
He's got you there.
Thanks, Roge.
A few minutes later, I walked into your office and you were holding a conversation with a brick.
Oh, I can explain that, sir.
That was me.
Roger.
That was I?
Lie down.
Uh, sir, I was just speaking out loud.
I was trying to work out one of my problems.
Oh, and now we're getting somewhere.
What, uh, is your problem, Major Nelson?
Ahem.
The inversion temperature at which silver iodide becomes effective, sir.
I beg your pardon.
Uh, we're trying to create artificial rain, and we seed the air with silver iodide.
Yeah, and it worked too, didn't it?
Yeah.
You mean you're able to make it rain only on you?
Well, I was starting small, but in time I was hoping that Oh, never mind, never mind.
That'll be all today, gentlemen.
Well, doc, thanks for the use of the couch.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Oh, and, Major Nelson.
Yes, sir?
I just want you to know that you're not deceiving me.
Oh, I don't wish to deceive you, sir.
You'd be surprised how much better you'd feel if you'd unburden yourself.
Well, believe me, doctor, I I wish I could unload my problem on you.
But I don't know what it is.
Uh, will that be all, sir?
That'll be all for now.
Thank you, sir.
Jeannie.
Oh, master, I tried to call you back What's the matter with you anyway?
Who?
What is the matter with me?
Yeah, you genies are all alike.
Promises, promises, promises.
When it comes to delivery, nothing, absolutely nothing.
What are you talking about?
Today, today.
All these tricks you've been You've been driving me crazy with these tricks Let's finish up the dictation over here, miss.
Hi, George.
But I have done nothing.
I I told you I transferred my power.
Oh, sure, you did.
Sure, you did.
You transferred your power.
To you.
To me.
To me?
!
You transferred your power to me?
Yes, master.
Y-you mean I did it?
You did what, master?
Everything.
Uh Tons of paper in the room and And changing Roger into a brick.
Now, uh, Jeannie, you should have told me.
I could have gotten somebody in terrible trouble.
But everything is all right now, master?
Yeah, everything's just great.
Help!
There are no limits to this power, are there?
Oh, no, master, but you must be very careful of what you say.
Yeah, now you tell me.
What are you going to do?
I don't really know.
I'm going to have to give it some thought, Jeannie.
I could, uh I could stop a war.
Flood the Sahara.
Wipe out the common cold.
I really don't know where to begin.
May I give you some advice, master?
Well, that's very kind of you but with a power like mine, I don't really need your advice, Jeannie.
I could put an Apollo capsule on the moon.
Master.
Hmm?
Please be careful.
It is not as easy as it seems.
It What do you mean?
Well, your world is very complicated.
If you stop one war, you're liable to start 10 others.
And if you flood the Sahara, you may empty an ocean.
Oh, believe me, master, it would be much better if you would start with something smaller.
I think you'd better run along, Jeannie.
Let me handle this.
After all, it's man's work.
When I was doing it, it was woman's work.
Yeah Ahem.
Just go on home, that's a good girl.
Mm-mm.
I I I do not want to leave you.
Well, let's put it this way: I'm not asking you to go home, I'm telling you, or better yet, I wish you to go home.
You're still here.
What?
What's wrong?
Yes.
I do not know, master.
But you gave me the power, didn't you?
Oh, yes, master.
You did not give it to someone else, did you?
Well, how could I have?
I didn't even know I had it.
I remember five minutes ago, I said to Dr. Bellows, I wish I could unload my problems on you.
Oh, master.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Has the painter arrived yet?
Oh, good.
How do you like the new color?
Oh, it looks wonderful.
I was absolutely right about the green.
The green?
I thought we agreed the house was going to be yellow?
No, dear, it's going to be green.
Amanda, we discussed this, and I told the painter we were going to use yellow.
I want the house painted yellow.
Now Now don't be unreasonable.
Darling, it has to be green.
It matches my new green outfit.
So no matter how I feel about it, the house is now being painted green.
Oh!
Darling, I didn't know you felt so strongly about this.
I'm sorry, dear, he's He's practically finished painting it green.
I mean, I don't see how we could possibly stop him.
Amanda, I don't care what it costs.
I will not live in a green house.
I want the house yellow.
Alfred, you're being childish.
Now, darling, remember, you're a psychiatrist.
I mean you're supposed to set an example for people.
Amanda, you're unleashing my hostilities.
All right, darling, let's say we compromise.
Very well.
Green and yellow.
What time will I see you tonight, dear?
All right, bye.
Bye.
Come in.
Dr. Bellows.
Yes?
Is everything all right, sir?
Well, of course everything is all right, why wouldn't it be all right?
Uh, nothing's happening, huh?
Happening?
N-nothing strange or anything like that?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well Good.
Good.
Then I These are all in order, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, uh, thank you, Major Healey.
Now if there's nothing else, gentlemen, I, uh I'd like to get on and finish my speech for the press conference tonight.
Oh, uh, I'm introducing you.
Oh, I really don't think you ought to go to that, sir.
Not go?
Well, anything could happen.
You know Don't be ridiculous, major.
Why, I I wouldn't miss this night for anything.
You're going to have to be very careful of what you say, sir.
Well, I know what I'm going to say, major.
"Ladies and gentlemen, "I make my small contribution to the space program "behind a desk.
"But like everyone else, in my heart I wish I could trade places with Major Anthony Nelson".
Hmm.
What?
What happened?
We changed places.
You were standing over here.
No, I just moved a little, sir.
Moved a little?
You were standing Why don't you run along?
Uh, doctor, I really don't think you ought to go, sir.
But I saw I'm going.
And I'm going to make my speech tonight.
Now let's just say that this is the table Well, it's the speakers' table where we'll be sitting tonight.
Ladies and gentlemen If you say so, sir.
If you say so?
Look at that.
Uh, he's trying to get us to imagine the surrounding, Roger.
Yeah, I can see it as plain as day.
Oh, uh, I'm not feeling very well.
Of course you're not, sir, you've been under a terrific strain.
Yes.
It is a banquet table, I I can feel it.
I can smell the food.
I've never had an experience like this.
Well, you're a psychiatrist, sir, you know how powerful the subconscious can be.
You could get rid of the table if you wanted to.
I could?
All you have to do is say I wish the table was gone.
I wish the table would go away.
And I wish my desk was back.
And I wish my desk was back.
It's back!
Excuse me.
Boy, have I got a powerful subconscious.
It was never gone, sir.
It was all in your mind.
All in my mind.
Yes, sir.
You wish I had your problem.
I wish you had my problem.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on!
?
Nothing's going on.
Everything's fine.
Yeah.
Dr. Bellows is the happiest man in the world.
You about ready, Jeannie?
Tsk.
Oh, I am sorry, master, but I am having a terrible time with my hair.
I simply do not how to use these silly things.
Well, don't worry about it, your hair will be beautiful.
Oh, you did that very well, master.
Thank you.
Now I only have one problem.
I I can't wait until tomorrow.
I can give you your power back to you.
Well, I told you it was not easy.
Yeah.
Well I won't have the problem of not letting any magic loose all over the place.
That is very simple.
Simply do not talk.
Well, it's not as simple as all that.
I mean, it's a press dinner, they're gonna be asking a lot of questions.
I wish I could get through the evening without uttering a single word.
I think you've solved your problem, master.
Well, blink.
Testing, one, two, three, four.
I just have to be careful.
Don't worry about a thing, I won't make any mistakes.
Yes, master.
Let's go.
Hey!
Hey, Pedro!
Stop, stop.
Say, you shouldn't work so late, you're gonna ruin your health.
Working?
It's the lawn mower.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that, that motor's gonna run for years.
Well, let's go to the banquet.
Yes, master.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Respiration, pulse rate, heartbeat all excellent.
Gentlemen you have just qualified to participate as guinea pigs in an experimental program.
Congratulations.
Guinea pig?
What kind of guinea pig, sir?
Oh, you'll see.
And now, if you'll excuse me, I, um I must inform Commander Kiski, the director of the new program, that you're ready to begin.
Now?
Now, major.
But a-all the guys just went to lunch, sir.
And until I return, I suggest that you both exercise vigorously.
Commander Kiski likes his guinea pigs to be warmed up.
Boy, for a few knee bends, we have to miss lunch.
I hope this Kiski isn't some kind of an exercise fanatic.
Well.
I wouldn't worry about it.
We're in pretty good shape.
Think we can breeze through anything this guy throws at us, unless he's Attila the Hun.
Huh?
Oh, what are you doing here, huh?
Oh, master, do you not remember?
You and Major Healey promised to take me out to dinner tonight.
Oh, no.
I forgot about that.
And dancing.
Ohh!
Do you like my dress?
Yeah, it's pretty, but But, but, but.
Yeah, yeah, it's great.
Jeannie, will you get out of here?
We gotta work out.
What is "work out"?
Well, it's a lot of running and jumping, bending and stretching.
But if you do all that, will you not be too tired to take me dancing tonight?
No, no.
Listen, we could chop rocks all day and still be in good shape to take you out.
Now go on.
Go on home, please.
You are sure you will not be too tired?
Absolutely.
Please, will you?
Very well then.
Until tonight.
Yeah, sure.
Tonight.
Okay.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Hello.
Uh, this is the director of your new physical-conditioning program.
Commander Frances N. Kiski.
Major Nelson, Major Healey.
How do you do, sir?
How are you, sir?
Attention!
Marshmallows.
It's Attila the Hun.
Major are you in good condition?
Yes, sir.
Wrong!
And you.
Wall-to-wall flab.
What do you say to Or are you afraid you might hurt yourself?
If you are just speak right up.
Oh-ho-ho Too easy, huh?
All right.
We'll try something else.
Now, watch.
Watch my hand.
Watch.
See what I mean?
See what I did?
Well you saw it.
You're dead.
I just killed you, and you didn't defend yourselves.
Well, we're at attention, sir.
"At attention, sir".
Oh, really?
Hm.
See what I mean, Dr. Bellows?
Proved my point.
These men are survival-soft.
Their animal instinct of kill or be killed has been ruined by their easy living.
Hm.
We've received the finest astronaut training, sir.
I think that, uh Kindergarten junk!
That's right.
I I am gonna teach you how to survive.
Punishment training.
Pain!
Pain!
Pain, going past suffering into the valley of agony.
That's right.
Now, what do you say to a quick And after that, you'll come back here, and we'll have three hours of special exercises.
A A 10-mile run and three hours, sir?
That's right, major.
That's right.
And tomorrow  We'll start the hard stuff.
Okay?
Right face!
Double-quick march!
Move it, move it, move it!
Move it, move it, move it, move it!
Move it, move it, move it!
He's trying to kill us.
Yeah.
Healey!
Yeah?
Oh, okay.
Time.
He's trying to kill us.
Kill us?
See it in his eyes.
He was testing us.
Trying to kill us.
But he couldn't break us down.
We won, don't you see?
Yeah.
Oh, that's good.
Ten minutes ago, I thought I died.
Let's get out of here.
Where are you going?
Who said school was out?
Oh, well, sir, you said You said we could leave after three hours of exercise.
I lied!
I tell that to all my boys to keep them on their tippy-tippy-toes.
You're not through yet.
Here.
Try these on.
I think there's a mistake.
Somebody, uh, put lead in the pockets.
It's a mistake.
There's lead in the pockets.
No, major.
It's not lead.
It's sand.
A hundred and fifty pounds of sand sewn into the lining of each jacket.
Oh, you look marvelous.
What do we do with these sand dunes now that we got 'em on?
What do you think you do with Run.
Uphill.
Now, move!
Move, move!
Move it, move it, move it!
Let's go!
Let's move it!
Oh, master.
And Major Healey.
I almost thought you had forgotten our date tonight.
You are very late.
You promised.
I know.
Jeannie, I'd love to take you for, uh, d-dancing, but Oh, thank you!
No.
What?
What happened?
You may not believe this, Roger, but I think we're going dancing.
Yes.
Come along.
Let's go.
Oh, wait.
Oh, oh-oh Come on.
Whoa, no.
Oh, this is such fun.
Are you enjoying yourself, Major Healey?
Major Healey?
Are you enjoying yourself?
Yes, I'm enjoying myself.
Oh.
Well, I-if you are too tired, we can go home.
No, I'm not too tired.
I-I w I don't want to go home.
Master?
Master, wake up.
Oh.
He's asleep.
Master, wake up.
Wake up.
Master.
Peekaboo.
Wake up.
Thank you, Armand.
I think you'll like this place, commander.
The, uh, music's a bit on the loud side, but the food is superb.
Hm.
Good.
After breaking down the men, I always have a good appetite.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Look who's here.
He's dancing.
That's incredible.
It's fabulous, doc.
You know, I've had to hold up my training program, because I couldn't get men strong enough to get the full treatment.
But with Nelson and Healey, starting tomorrow, I'll be able to give them the works.
The works?
Everything.
My secret plan.
Oh, master, you should have told me that Commander Kiski made you work out so hard.
Ahh!
Mm.
I would not have allowed you to go dancing.
The dancing was the easy part.
I slept through most of that.
Do you suppose it's possible to sprain skin?
Ohh!
Oh.
Well, let's hobble along with another day of fun and games with Killer Kiski.
Oh, but he will hurt you again.
Ah, no, no.
He won't be so rough on us today.
No, these physical fitness guys all work the same way.
They murder you the first day, then they ease off.
Yeah.
Ah, Jeannie.
Ah.
Ah.
Hello?
Major Nelson here.
Oh.
Yes, Commander Kiski.
Yes, sir.
Ye All right.
All right.
Well, what's wrong?
We're to report to Staging Area F, pick up our winter field uniforms.
Area F in our winter uniforms?
Are you kidding?
It's 100 degrees there.
Hundred and one.
Kiski checked.
Master, please let me help you.
No, I'll I'll take care of it.
It's my responsibility.
Tsk.
Yeah, It's not like in school, where your mother writes you an excuse.
Roge, giddyap.
An excuse from mother?
Mm.
I don't care what Nelson says.
He and Healey can't drink the water.
Now you tell those two softies to get over here on the double.
And make sure they zipper up their overcoats.
I'm through being a nice guy.
Hello.
What did?
How did you get in here?
Oh, I brought you a note from Major Nelson's mother.
A-and one from Major Healey's too.
You'll have to excuse them from any more, uh, exercises.
Notes from their mothers?
What are you, some sort of weird cocktail waitress?
Oh.
Please read the notes.
Oh.
I get it.
You're either a girlfriend of Nelson or Healey's, and you're trying to come over here and help them get out of some of those hard, nasty jobs.
Oh, believe me, I'm not doing that.
Mm, yeah.
I know.
It's women like you that love to smother guys.
Protect 'em, keep 'em soft.
Oh, I just want to see I've seen dames like you.
You ruin 'em with your cuddling.
I know.
My Aunt Effie tried to do it to me.
Hm.
Every day, I remember, "Eat your cottage cheese, Francis".
"Drink your milkie, Francis".
"Don't forget to wear your rubber hat, Francis".
Egh-yuck.
Your Aunt Effie sounds very sweet.
Sweet?
!
If I didn't get away from her, she would have made a sissy out of me.
But I'm not gonna let your pals get away.
Not till I make 'em as hard as steel.
I do not think your Aunt Effie would like the way you treat them.
Her?
She'd have them sitting under a tree eating blueberry pie.
Oh, that is nice.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you get!
Your Aunt Effie is a much nicer person.
Out of here, because I don't really care.
Major Healey and Major Nelson, sir.
Major Healey and Major Nelson?
I told you not to ask for water.
He'll kill us.
Attention!
Okay, you guys.
Now, I'm Oh, I'm I'm awfully sorry, boys.
Forgive me.
Oh, my goodness.
I'll have mercy on you.
You shouldn't be dressed in these hot outfits on a day like this.
It's ridiculous.
Take off those clothes.
Really, boys.
I don't want to see you suffer.
You should be able to relax and enjoy, and be nice and cool.
That's no way to dress in hot weather.
Here.
Have a drink of water there.
Don't drink it.
It's a trick.
Hey, listen, fellas.
I have an idea.
You ought to get into some shorts and sit under a nice cool tree.
I'll get you some pie.
Do you like blueberry pie?
It's delicious with cold milk.
You go ahead and rest here, and I'll go see about the pie, okay, fellas?
Ah.
Drink, enjoy.
You're marvelous.
Wonderful boys.
It's so drab in here.
You ought to have chintz to brighten it up a little bit.
Jeez, it would make it so beautiful.
Chintz?
In a tent?
Chintz?
It's a plot.
He's going to poison the pie.
It's a trick.
Why would he wanna poison the pie?
If it's not a trick, we're in the hands of a raving maniac.
Boys.
Boys?
Boys?
Boys.
Oh.
There you are.
There you are.
Hurry up, boys.
It's naughty to be a slowpoke.
What am I saying?
Don't go with him.
He's trying to get us lost.
Just like Hansel and Gretel.
I know he's acting kind of peculiar, but that pie was delicious.
Oh.
My, the air out here is wonderful.
Yeah.
Are you comfortable, master?
Yeah.
Uh, listen, uh, get out of here.
Kiski's gonna be back any minute.
Yeah, with more pie.
I couldn't eat another bite.
Oh, I'm glad you two are getting along so well with him.
Well, he's not such a bad guy once you know him.
Major!
Oh, come on, Jeannie.
Out, out.
Oh.
Yes, master.
Have a nice day.
Yeah Really, now Now Oh.
Come on.
Major!
Hey!
There you are.
Yeah.
Your easels are all set up.
Our easels?
Our easels?
Certainly.
On a glorious day like today, there's nothing like a good paint.
Good paint?
Well, you go right ahead.
We We'll be there.
Well, uh, ahem, you set up the easels.
Oh, easels.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I had a counselor like that when I was a kid in summer camp.
Eh What happened?
The camp nurse sent him home early.
Boys, painting time!
Easy.
Take it easy.
Where's Commander Kiski?
Uh, he's on a, uh nature hike, sir.
I'll call him for you.
Hello.
Kiski?
This is General Powlett.
Oh, hello, General Powlett.
How are you, sir?
Lovely day, isn't it?
Uh Excuse me a moment, general.
Uh, Tony Yeah?
Yours is very good but your bunny's all wrong.
Your bunny should have big, floppy ears and a tiny, fluffy tail.
It's an elm tree.
Oh, yeah.
Heh.
And a lovely tree it is.
Uh, Roger, yours is very good too.
I love yours.
I love your purple and yellow sky.
Very excellent.
Heh.
Are you out of your mind?
Floppy ears and fluffy tail?
What did you do to Kiski?
Well, all I did was take him notes from your mothers to excuse you from the exercises I I don't want to hear anymore.
Well, he did not even read the notes.
All he did was talk about his sweet, little old Aunt Effie who used to make him drink milk and And baked him blueberry pies.
And And you turned him into his Aunt Effie?
Well, I only wanted to Yeah Jeannie, you shouldn't have interfered.
You can't I will not let him work you so hard.
But you can't Right back to Hey, I didn't know that Kiski had an Aunt Effie.
I thought his only relative was the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
Oh, funny.
That's funny.
Well, how about the monster that stepped on Cincinnati?
Roger.
All right, men, we're nearing the drop zone.
This will be a survival exercise under conditions of maximum hazard.
Commander Kiski, would you like to brief your men?
Please be careful.
For this exercise, we have simulated a drop into enemy territory.
The enemy has already spotted this aircraft, and from the moment you land, they will be in pursuit.
Ohh!
That's exciting.
Under no circumstances will you permit yourselves to be captured.
Is that clear?
Yes, sir.
Good luck, gentlemen.
Ready, sir.
All right.
Stand up.
Hook up.
Ah.
Roger.
Button up your collar.
It's drafty outside.
Tony, are your chute straps tight?
And for goodness' sake, please, stand up straight.
Go!
Well, come on, Aunt Effie.
Here we go.
Jump.
Aunt Effie?
He called him Aunt Effie.
Oh.
Yes, sir.
It's a term we use when we jump out of a plane.
Uh, like "Geronimo".
Aunt Effie!
Aunt Effie?
Any sign of Kiski?
Yes.
He parachuted right in the middle of the enemy camp.
You're kidding.
Yeah.
And we're on the wrong side of the river.
You mean we're in enemy territory?
Yeah!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Hey.
Did someone call?
Oh.
Jeannie.
Here.
There's Jeannie, we are in enemy territory.
They've got Kiski.
Do you have any idea what they're gonna do to him at At headquarters if he arrives in his condition, huh?
Anyway, this whole area's surrounded by enemy patrols.
Get us out of here, quick.
Yeah.
Well, I thought you'd never ask.
They're gone.
Well, I had them spotted for a moment, sir, but they seem to have disappeared.
Well I don't know, sir.
They were there just a moment ago but, well, they're gone.
- Don't, sir.
- I  We're back on the plane.
Yes.
Now you can jump on the right side of the river.
No.
Jeannie, don't you understand?
We've got to rescue Kiski.
We've got to get to the other side of the Ahh!
Come on, Major Healey.
Hey, wait a minute.
You haven't got a parachute.
Yeah.
Yes.
Isn't that exciting?
Aunt Effie!
Aunt Effie.
You sure?
Okay.
All right.
Sentry's spotted two more parachutes on this side of the river.
Uh, I'll cover this sector.
You blindfold the prisoner.
Take him to headquarters.
Untie me.
I'll scratch your eyes out!
Move.
The prisoner got away, sir.
Hop in.
We'll catch him.
They've been reported where, general?
Right there.
But that's 30 miles from the drop area.
It isn't possible.
Don't ask me to explain it, doctor, but I know that they helped Kiski escape, and somehow commandeered an enemy vehicle.
Blue Squadron has got 'em trapped in Box Canyon.
General Powlett.
What?
Well, they've got to be there.
Are you sure?
They got out.
Now, how did Kiski do that?
But you said there was no way out, sir.
There was one way.
Straight up.
Thanks for the ride, Jeannie.
Oh, You are very welcome, master.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What are we gonna do with our fearless leader?
Untie me, you rotten boys.
Untie me.
Blink him back to normal.
Oh, but master, he is so mean.
Yeah.
Well, I know that, but I-it's his career, Jeannie.
Go on.
And you blink out of here too.
Oh, no, master.
Go on.
I'm not kidding.
You never let me have any fun.
Jeannie?
Ah!
Hold on.
You untie him.
Take off his blindfold, and I'll take this off.
Whoa, maybe we better just take off the blindfold.
Wait a minute.
You meatheaded, goldbricking, jet jockeys!
I'm gonna break you Gee, sir.
Uh, sir.
Can you walk?
Sure, I can walk!
What are you?
You got us through that survival mission without a scratch.
Help him, Roger.
He's weak.
Who's weak?
I'll The survival mission?
Yeah, you were an inspiration to both of us.
Don't you remember, sir?
Well, of course he doesn't remember.
He struck his head on that rock, trying to save your life.
I did?
On the survival course?
Steady.
Whoa.
Take it easy.
I'm perfectly all right.
I'm perfectly all right.
All right.
Just leave me alone.
Whoa.
Le Let me down.
You and Healey?
On the survival course?
I did?
We'll tell you all about it before General Powlett gets here.
Okay.
Okay.
But just Just help me.
I I don't feel too good.
I don't know how you did it.
Your act is gonna go down in history as one of the most heroic acts ever.
And so, gentlemen, because of your miraculous, and in my view, highly suspicious success, headquarters has decided to abandon Commander Kiski's program.
Abandon it, sir?
Well, if it were such a success, why Why do they want to abandon it?
Because we feel that you had already been superbly conditioned as astronauts.
Ah.
N-no more punishment.
Uh, from now on, it's, uh, easy living, huh?
However, headquarters feels that it's vital to maintain your fine conditioning.
And to that end, they have assigned a permanent physical instructor.
You soft-bellied lounge lizards.
This is where I remove the fat from your frame.
Right.
Put that down!
Now get moving.
What are you standing here for?
Hut two, hut two, hut two.
Marshmallows.
Ho-ho.
You guys, move it!
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Two packed meals, two horses and a guide.
Yeah.
Right.
And you got my check for 300 dollars?
Okay, I'll be there.
Right No, no.
No chance.
How does this look, master?
Thanks a lot.
I'll see you.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Well, the fish are gonna love you.
I can hardly wait to go.
I've never been on a fishing trip before.
Yeah Well, I've waited three years for this vacation.
I'm a little rusty with this thing.
Rusty?
Mmm.
And how would I look if I came home without a fish?
Oh, you do not have to worry about that, master.
Oh, yeah?
What?
Whoa!
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
That's a A fake fish.
Practice.
Alfred, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm, uh, packing these books.
Uh, I'm bringing them on our vacation.
Well, you might as well unpack them.
Unpack them?
We're not going.
Not going?
Who says we're not going?
The Rolling Waves.
Oh, Amanda, what are you talking about?
Darling, the Rolling Waves were all set to sing at my charity bazaar, and now they've canceled out.
Well, why would they do that?
Because they were mobbed in Indiana, and one of them is in the hospital.
Oh, I hope it's nothing serious.
Nothing serious?
Alfred, I have to find another group to replace them, darling.
And that's why we can't go on our vacation.
Amanda.
Do you mean to tell me, that I have to cancel my vacation, that I've waited for for five years because a Rolling Wave was mobbed in Indiana?
I'm sorry, dear.
Yes.
Well, you can't be serious.
Darling, now look.
I'm the chairman of the entertainment committee, correct?
Yes.
And I discovered the Rolling Waves.
Well then, darling, it's up to me to find another group to replace them.
How long will that take?
I don't know, dear.
I'm working on it now.
Amanda, the general knows I'm going on my vacation.
All the boys at the officers' club know I'm going on my vacation.
I'm sorry, dear.
Oh, well.
I'll try to find some excuse.
Oh, Amanda.
Don't let anyone know that I've cancelled my vacation because of the Rolling Waves.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
But after all, darling that's show business.
Major Nelson.
Oh.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing?
Sir, I'm I'm just practicing.
I'm I'm going on my vacation tomorrow.
Well, I wouldn't count on it if I were you.
Why not, sir?
Well, we're gonna postpone your vacation.
Postpone it?
But I've been waiting for three years for this vacation, sir.
I know some people who've waited five years for their vacation.
I'm sorry, major, but we're expediting your tests for the lunar project.
We're starting tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
Yes, I'm afraid so.
Well, how long are the tests gonna last, sir?
I have no idea.
Major, that's show business.
Major.
Sir.
If you don't Well, thank you.
Master, I'm home.
Well, I What?
Hello?
Look what I bought.
How do you like it?
Oh, brother.
What are you doing?
I'm trying to get a little use out of this equipment, before I have to send it back.
That's the guy who's probably coming to pick up his stuff.
Oh, I'll get it.
Ahh, Jeannie.
Uh, there's something wrong in the kitchen with the tap.
Would you check it please?
Oh, yes, master.
Oh, boy.
Yes?
Oh, hello, major.
Oh, pardon me for barging in like this.
Oh, isn't this cute.
You're camping out in your living room.
Well, that's adorable.
You know, I try to get Alfred to do things like this, but he's just too conservative.
Yeah.
I'm just, uh, trying out some equipment that I'm not gonna be able to use.
Oh You're going on a vacation, huh?
Well, it's been postponed.
Isn't that a coincidence.
You know, Alfred's vacation's been postponed too.
Oh, really?
You see, since I've lost the Rolling Waves, I can't go.
So, I mean, naturally if I can't go, Alfred can't go either.
Oh, naturally.
Obviously.
So that's why I'm here, major.
You see, since I've lost the Rolling Waves, I have to find another musical group to replace them.
And I thought  Maybe you could help me find a musical group.
I really don't know anything about singing.
I'll tell you what we need.
We need a group that's hip.
Hip?
Yes.
You listen to the radio, don't you?
Well, I Wasn't going to take this on vacation with me.
That.
That's what we need.
Why?
Well, major, because that is the kind of music that draws crowds.
Don't you understand?
See, I'm in charge of this whole thing.
It was all my idea.
I I've got to get another group to replace them.
I'm not gonna leave town until I get a group that is gonna kill them.
Oh, I see.
If I can help you find a group, then you and Dr. Bellows can go on your vacation.
Exactly, exactly.
That's it.
Yes, yes.
Oh, major.
Huh?
Oh, sorry.
Yes.
But you listen to me.
It is very important that Alfred not know that I asked you for any help.
Oh, don't worry about a thing.
I'd be the last one to tell him.
Thank you very much, major.
Now, listen, if you hear of anything at all.
You know, if you think of any, you will let me know.
Yes, I certainly will.
I mean, it'd be such a shame to waste all that marvelous equipment.
I know.
I-I Bye.
Master.
Oh, master, you will never guess what?
I've just figured it out.
Do you know why Dr. Bellows canceled your vacation?
Yeah.
So do you.
You've been listening in the kitchen.
Well, why are you unhappy?
Jeannie, do you have any idea?
How hard do you think it'd be to find a better group than this?
They remind me of a group that Caligula had beheaded.
Well, you could pick up better singers on any street corner.
You could?
Oh, well, then I think I can solve your problem, master.
Huh?
You mean you know a group?
Well, I I do not know a group but I I think I know where I can find one.
Yeah?
How long would it take you to get them?
Can you give me 10 minutes?
Sure.
That's my girl.
Ah, there we are.
Where are we?
I don't feel so good.
Oh, you will.
Oh, dear.
Someone is missing.
Ah.
Ha!
I'm here to pick up the camping equipment.
Oh, I know.
Now, we are ready.
Ready for what?
I can hardly wait to hear you sing.
I'm sorry lady, but I don't sing.
Neither do I. Oh.
Well, I thought everyone sang.
Jeannie, did the guy come to pick up Oh.
Hey, this is the group.

You are all going to sing at a charity bazaar.
I'm getting out of here.
But, sir, Tony's been looking forward to this vacation for a long time.
No, Major Healey.
I'm not going on my vacation, Major Nelson's not going on his vacation.
We're gonna do these tests and that's final.
Oh, morning, sir.
Good morning.
I'm ready to go to work.
Yes, I see you are.
It'll take us about six weeks to get through all this stuff.
Yes.
What are you so happy about, major?
Oh, uh, good music always does that to me, sir.
I just heard a new singing group.
They're fantastic.
This new singing group?
Yes, sir.
Uh, Tommy Boyce and Bobby Hart.
They're really great.
Well, shall we go to work on this?
You mean they're here?

The singing group?

I imagine so.
Uh, you see the PCH starts Major, will you stop changing the subject?
Well, I thought this was the subject, sir.
Where can I get hold of them?
I believe they're on their way over to your house.
Now, you don't think Dr. Bellows is going to let you go on vacation, do you?
Yeah, I know he is.
Well he's not, because I talked to him.
He's got experiments worked out so it's gonna take about the next 50 years.
No, I'm leaving in the morning.

You've been working terribly hard, but, uh That's what we're here for, sir.
I realize that it's been three years since you've had a vacation That's quite all right, sir.
I'm prepared to go ahead with the tests.
No, major.
I won't let you make that sacrifice.
It so happens, I'm taking a little vacation myself, starting tomorrow morning.

Why do you keep putting these things in my way?
You know, tomorrow afternoon I'm going to take them to see Phil Spector.
Good, good.
He handles the biggest musical acts in the country.
Uh, tomorrow afternoon we're not gonna be here.
We are not?

The Boyce & Hart Group.
Yeah.
You telling me that?
Oh, yes, master.
They need me.
Is it not strange they were not even interested in show business until the bazaar.
Jeannie, music is very well, in it's place it's great.
And when we come back from our vacation, you can listen to the Oh, no, master.
We must strike while the iron is hot.
Where'd you hear that?
Aristotle said it.
You know You know how you worry about me?
Yes, master.
Well, you have reason to.
Jeannie, I've been looking forward to this vacation for a long time.
Going to the great outdoors.
Under the stars, under the trees with maybe a fire in front of the tent.
And a tinkling little stream in the distance.
I need a rest.
A R-E-S-T.
Yes, master.
Yes.
Oh, good evening, Major Nelson, I hope we're not disturbing you.
It's my fault anyway, major.
I insisted that we come by and thank you personally.
Yes.
Come in.
Thank you.
You're camping in your living room.
Yeah, it's sort of a rehearsal, sir.
With trees?
And a babbling brook?
I wanted to get the feel of it.
I think it's marvelous.
Oh, Alfred, why don't we ever do something like this?
Amanda, I spend half my life curing people who do things like this.
I see you even have a fire going.
Yes, sir.
Got chilly in here.
I think we'll be running along.
Oh, yes.
But, major, listen, I want to thank you again.
You don't know what that group did for me.
I can't tell you what they did for me.
I wouldn't wait until tomorrow to go on your vacation if I were you.
I'd leave now.
Trees.
Tent, fire and babbling brook.
Hey, baby.
How you doing?
Yeah, look, I just played your new song.

Uh, look, I'll talk to you later.
How did you get in here?
Excuse me, are you Mr. Phil Spector?
Look, it's been a real bad day.
Would you come back in April?
Are you not looking for singers?
You'll have to make an appointment.
Uh, hello?
No.
No, you have to go to Nashville, and bring the group back yourself.
I'm telling you, it's the greatest group I ever heard in years.

I can't cancel.
It'd give her the upper hand for the rest of my life.
Yeah, well, what's she got now?
Besides, it's the principle of the thing.
I got 300 dollars tied up in that equipment.
Well, think of it this way.
It only cost you 200 dollars.
Master!
Hey, what do you mean?
There's Jeannie now.
Master!
I knew she'd come back.
I never doubted it for a minute.
Master!
Oh!
Oh.
I looked all over for you.
Oh, well, I was, uh, just leaving, Jeannie.
Oh, but I could not let you leave without me.
Couldn't you?
Oh, no, I would miss you so very much.
Well, let this be a lesson to you.
How long would it take you to pack?
Oh, not long.
Oh!
Well You sure you didn't forget anything?
I do not think so.
So long, Roge.
Yeah.
Well, have a good time, and, uh, write me something in Jeannie, huh?
We will.
Now, I have our route all marked out.
First, we stop in Chicago.
Um, Jeannie, we're going to Little Bear Lake.
Oh, did I not tell you?
We are going on tour.
After Chicago, we stop in Minneapolis, Detroit and Montreal.
Bom, bom bom bom bom Bom-bom, bom-bom Out and about Bom, bom bom bom bom Bom-bom, bom-bom Out and about Bah buh-dum-dum
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Two three.
Mm.
Would you like a ham on rye?
No.
I'm not programmed to eat for another 15 minutes in here yet.
Forgot the mustard again.
Mm!
Hey.
Look at this.
Pardon my glove.
Oh, thanks.
What are you doing, master?
What is it you think?
Oh.
This is a heat test chamber, Jeannie.
We're trying to find out how much heat a human body can stand.
Y You're not supposed to eat that.
Excuse me, Gary.
How long have they been in there?
Four hours and 30 minutes, Dr. Bellows.
Oh.
That's enough.
Yes, sir.
We're bringing you out, gentlemen.
I don't want them to bring me out.
This is the first good steam bath I've had in months.
If you enjoy this, master, you can do it in your very own living room.
Goodbye.
Oh.
Very well.
I will see you at dinner.
Mwah.
Ah.
How you feeling, Major Nelson?
Fine.
Good.
Fine.
And you, Major Healey?
The sandwich was a little dry.
Sandwich?
Oh, the tube sandwich, with the Oh, yes.
We're assigning you to a special mission, Major Nelson.
Oh, the Apollo project, sir?
I, uh, heh-heh No, uh, not quite.
NASA has approved of making the documentary film and, uh they're going to, uh, bring in a movie expert from Hollywood.
Oh?
Oh, really?
W-what does that have to do with me, sir?
Well, you're going to act in the film.
Oh, really?
Oh, ha-ha, here we are.
This is your director, Mr. Allen Kerr.
This is, uh, Major Healey and, uh, Major Nelson.
How do you do, sir?
A star is born.
But I-I think you have the wrong man.
Uh, I've never done any acting, Mr. Kerr.
Allen.
Allen.
Won't be necessary for you to do any acting, major.
I want the real you.
The whole idea is to photograph an average day in the life of an average astronaut.
Your Your home life, everything.
My My home life?
That's what I said.
I really don't think it would work.
Why not, major?
Well, I'm not an average astronaut.
I Actually, I don't have any family.
I Uh, Major Nelson, um, General Brindley has asked us for full cooperation.
Now, uh, since Mr. Kerr has been kind enough to come out here from Hollywood and lend his assistance, it's, uh, up to us to make everything as easy as possible for him.
There's nothing to worry about, major.
As long as you have me behind the camera.
I-I do think that perhaps we ought to give it just a little more thought.
Did you send for me, sir?
Oh, uh, yes, major.
I thought you'd be sending for me.
Well, here are the results of the heat-chamber tests.
Take them to the lab for me, will you?
Yes, sir.
Was there anything else, major?
Well, I heard you were filming a documentary, and I've had acting experience.
And I thought you might be needing me.
Oh, were you an actor, Major Healey?
Well, I played King Lear.
King Lear?
O-on Broadway?
Horace Mann High School.
"Horace Mann High School".
We're making a documentary, major.
Uh, we don't need actors.
Well, if Roger'd like to do this instead of me, uh, I have no objection.
Why don't you both do it?
You work as a team anyway.
And I could help Tony out.
Well, that's settled.
I'm not too familiar with, uh, movie techniques.
Uh, could you answer a question?
Shoot.
What's Ann-Margret really like?
I'd like to, uh, spend as much time as I can with you, major.
I really like to get to know my actors.
Oh.
Yes, I can understand that.
Splendid.
But how about dinner tonight at your house?
Uh-uh, dinner tonight?
Uh, you know, tonight really is not the best Why not?
We're having Turkish leftovers.
I've never had Turkish leftovers.
That sounds intriguing.
Oh.
Major, I think it'd be a very good idea for Mr. Kerr to see you in your home environment.
We're gonna shoot you there too.
I believe it.
What?
I We're redecorating.
The whole place is a mess.
You didn't decorate your house.
You kidding?
Perfect.
It'd make it seem more homey.
See you at 7.
Homey.
At 7.
Yes, uh, right.
Would you all excuse me?
I have a A A pressing engagement.
Yes, master.
Uh, hello, Jeannie?
Look, I want you to mess up the house.
Mess up the house?
I just finished vacuuming.
Look, this is important.
I have a very important guest coming.
And, uh Uh, well, the house has got to be messed up for him.
Uh I want you to make it look terrible.
Oh.
Well if that is what you wish.
Don't overdo it.
Make it look like I've been redecorating.
Yes, master.
And try to look inconspicuous.
"Inconspicuous"?
Yeah.
Do the best you can.
Uh, here we are.
Oh.
Wow.
You, uh Y-you live here?
Well, it's just an experiment, you see.
It Wow.
What happened to your place?
I like it.
You do?
It breathes.
Reminds me of a wild bird soaring into space.
I can't wait to photograph you in this room.
Good evening.
Oh, good evening.
I'm uh I'm Allen Kerr.
I am Jeannie.
I am Major Nelson's Decorator.
She's my interior decorator.
Oh, you've done a marvelous job, darling.
Oh, thank you.
Uh, Mr. Kerr is here to direct a documentary.
Oh, how exciting.
Oh, will you sit down, please?
Thank you.
Being a director must be very interesting.
It has its rewards.
There's nothing like the satisfaction of getting a good performance from a clod.
A "clod"?
Most actors are clods.
Well, how do you get a good performance out of them?
I whip them into it.
You whip them into it?
In the old days, when I made B pictures, I was known as "The Beast of the Bs".
I can't stand incompetence.
Well, I don't blame you.
When I have an actor in front of my camera, I expect him to know his job.
Heaven help him if he doesn't.
I'll have my camera crew here first thing in the morning.
I think we'll, um start in this corner.
He sounds pretty tough.
Don't worry, I'll pull you through.
It's gonna work.
Oh?
See you at the crack of dawn.
All right.
We're gonna pick up.
Major Healey coming in the door in a In a wide shot Yeah.
And then go to a tight two.
And then the next, uh W-where's my script girl?
What does he mean by a "tight two"?
Why are the little people always frustrating me?
May I help you?
Do you have a stopwatch?
A stopwatch?
Heh.
Yes.
Uh Uh, shall we, um?
Shall we go over the scene once more?
I don't think that'll be necessary.
I know my lines.
An old pro never forgets.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Let's do it anyway.
You've come over to have breakfast with Tony, and you're discussing the new project.
Now, have you got that?
Got it.
Now go out the door and get ready for your entrance.
Right.
Tony, there's the door.
I'm sorry.
Do not worry.
Go, go, go.
Tony, please!
Sorry, sorry.
Hi, Roge.
Good morning, Tony.
How you feeling this morning?
Oh, fine, fine.
It's a pretty exciting day.
I can't wait to test the new scale model of the lunar landscape.
Neither can I. Like some coffee before you go to work?
I'd love a cup of coffee before we go to work.
How do you take it?
Cream and sugar.
I wonder what it's gonna be like to be the first man to land on the moon.
I guess we won't know until we get there.
Very good.
Uh, you really like it?
Wait till I say "cut".
"Cut"?
What was the timing on that?
Oh.
The timing?
Uh Nine and three-quarter seconds.
What's that, a psychedelic egg timer?
Okay, let's shoot it.
Be calm.
All right, here we go.
Like in rehearsal.
Like in rehearsal.
Your entrance from the front door.
From the front door.
Hm.
Major?
Yes, yes, yes.
Whenever you're ready.
I'm ready.
Oh, one more.
Ready, ready.
All right, here we go.
And let's have it quiet.
I don't even want breathing.
Ready?
Roll 'em!
Action!
The bell.
The bell.
The Ring the doorbell, Major Healey.
Thank you.
Major Nelson.
Major Nelson.
That's you, Tony baby.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Oh, hi, Roge.
Morning, Tony.
How you feeling this morning?
Fine.
Pretty exciting day.
I can't wait to test the new scale model of the lunar landscape.
Neither can I. Uh, would you like a cup of coffee before we go to work?
I'd love a cup of coffee before we go to work.
How do you take it?
I guess we won't know until we get there.
I wonder what it's gonna be like to be the first man to land on the moon.
Cream and sugar.
What?
Uh Uh, what?
Cut!
Cut?
What are you doing?
What do you mean, what am I doing?
That "cream and sugar" stuff on the moon.
Ah.
I know what you mean.
You're too tense.
Relax.
It's too much.
Too much for him.
L-let's try it again.
It's a long scene.
W-what?
Just  Open the door.
Morning, Tony.
How you feeling this morning?
Cut!
What What What time is it?
Oh.
I-it is Lunch!
Lunch?
That was pretty good, Roge.
Come in.
Ah, Mr. Kerr.
Oh, uh, anything the matter?
Yes.
Roger Healey.
You know, King Lear.
Well, if you're having any trouble getting cooperation The problem is, I'm getting a little too much cooperation.
He's the lousiest actor I've ever seen.
Well, I'm sure that everything will turn out.
What about Major Nelson?
Dr. Bellows, can I level with you?
Well, of course.
I'd like to make Tony Nelson a star.
Take him to Hollywood.
I got a part in my next picture that he'd be perfect for.
Oh.
I'm sure Major Nelson would never be interested in going to Hollywood.
I was hoping he might have a vacation coming up.
I've worked with the biggest stars in this business, and he's a natural if I ever saw one.
He'll be the biggest star in Hollywood.
You really think so?
I know so.
He has a quality that nobody teaches you.
It's a gift.
Well, I always thought he was colorful, but Shines right out at you.
Blinds you.
Doctor, you put him on the screen, and he'll have every woman in the country swooning.
One picture and he'll be bigger than Rock Hudson.
Me bigger than Rock Hudson?
Oh, my Yes?
Yeah, Major Healey.
Right.
Oh, all right.
Thank you very much.
Uh, Roger reported to the main gate an hour ago, nobody's seen him since.
Shall I go look for Major Healey?
No.
I have a better idea.
We'll shoot this scene without him.
Oh, but I'm sure I can find him.
Let's not press our luck.
We'll make it now.
We'll pick it up right over here.
Hi, hi, hi, hi.
How's it going?
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
Uh, good morning, good morning.
Good morning.
Hi, Roge.
What's the outfit for?
Oh, this old thing?
Ha.
Well, I thought I'd give the scene a little color.
I came to Cape Kennedy to make a documentary in three days.
You're turning this into War and Peace.
Don't you think I've suffered too?
I know things have been going slowly, but old Roge will help.
I don't need any help!
Sorry, gang.
Let's do it!
Quiet, please.
Believe it or not, gang, I think we're finally ready.
Now, in this shot Major Healey will be out of frame, and reenter and rendezvous with Major Nelson.
One note: Please don't act, Major Healey.
Be honest.
Natural.
Honest.
Just be yourself.
Tony.
Do it just the way you've been doing it.
It's perfect.
Okay.
This will be picture.
Take him out.
Roll 'em.
Speed.
Action!
Over here, Roge.
Roge!
Rendezvous.
Roge.
R-rendezvous.
Cut!
Cut!
Cut!
Let him down.
Let him down.
Let him down.
Major Healey.
We're not doing Peter Pan.
Call Hollywood.
I'll get this shot if it kills me.
And you too.
Three thousand miles for this.
Uncle Sam, I've done more than my share.
Hey.
What's gotten into you, anyway?
What's gotten into me?
I'm gonna be a big star.
That's what's gotten into me.
Yeah?
Who says so?
Haven't you heard?
I'm going to be bigger than Rock.
Rock who?
Rock Hudson.
Well, who said that?
I heard our director telling Dr. Bellows.
And he should know.
Well, back to the old grind.
I think I'll get a little makeup on.
It's a little dark around here.
Roger's no actor.
You can say that again, baby.
I was talking about you.
You Me?
Poor Major Healey.
Look, I'm sorry if there's been some misunderstanding, but Major Healey is King Clod.
Well, I don't think we really have a problem.
He's a dedicated astronaut.
I I don't think he's interested in Hollywood.
Oh, that's a break.
For Hollywood, I mean.
Yes.
Major Healey reminds me of an actor I once knew who was in a play by Aristotle.
His name was Xerxes.
Homer Xerxes.
Yeah.
He rode a chariot up a hill, over three A A-a chariot?
Oh, she's an old theater buff.
Yeah.
Sweetheart, you and I are gonna have to have a little chat.
Oh, I would enjoy that.
Well, I'm gonna force myself to go over and look at the rushes.
Would you, uh, care to see 'em?
Uh, I'd like to, but I think I'd better straighten Roger out.
I'd rather watch the rushes.
Okay.
Okay.
Major Healey is going to be very unhappy.
Oh, don't be silly.
You don't really think he's interested in acting, do you?
Yes, master.
Oh, just place those on my desk, sergeant.
I will see you on the set.
Yeah, all right.
All right  Um Uh, Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
Uh Major Healey seems to think he's a cross between Tony Curtis and, uh, Alec Guinness.
The Oh, well, Roger is, uh Well, I know what he is, major.
I've had a talk with Mr. Kerr.
Now, are you gonna tell him he's the worst actor in the world or shall I?
I'll tell him.
I'll tell him, sir.
Well, you better hurry.
He's going all over the base inviting people to his premiere.
I'll get right on it, sir.
Mm.
I don't want any place too elaborate.
Uh, someplace in Beverly Hills or Bel-Air?
Yeah, with a lot of grounds.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Yeah, I'd like a swimming pool and a tennis court.
Mm-hm.
And, uh, don't worry about the price, huh?
You can take it out of my first week's salary.
And look, Harry you're invited to all my premieres, huh?
And get on it and get back to me, right?
Okay, Hare.
Right.
Hi, Roge.
That was my Hollywood real-estate broker.
You don't smoke, do you?
I know.
It's not lit.
Oh.
Your Your eyes all right?
What?
Oh, these.
Oh, well, I've gotta get used to 'em.
You know how your fans are when they recognize you.
They just mob you.
Roge, I think we ought to have a little talk.
Oh, I know what you're going to say.
I know, I know.
And I'm going to miss you too.
We've We've been through a lot together.
You're gonna be able to leave all this?
"Leave all this"?
I don't wanna leave it all, but, you know, when you're talented well, I can't be selfish.
I can't disappoint my fans.
Roge, you're an astronaut.
I know.
Astronaut, movie star.
I just happen to be gifted.
You know something?
When I build my pool, I think I'm gonna have it shaped in the form of a capsule.
Something small with about 75 girls, you know.
You're invited to all my premieres.
Roge  Hey Excuse me.
Yeah.
Yeah?
Wait a minute.
Wh What was it?
Nothing.
You I'll talk to you later.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Seventy-five rooms?
Harry, I don't need seven bedrooms.
All right Yeah.
Call you back.
Well, I see that Major Nelson talked to you.
Oh, yeah.
He's a great guy.
Great.
Hm.
Frankly, I thought you'd be a little more upset.
Me upset, sir?
Well, I suppose it is something to be the worst actor in the world.
"The w-worst actor in the world"?
I didn't wanna tell you this, major, but, uh Mr. Kerr said that he'd never seen anyone quite like you.
That you You reminded him of his old hog-calling days.
Oh.
Are you sure he meant me?
I'm sorry, major, but, uh, I'm afraid so.
W-what happened to the masculine quality and looking And looking like Rock Hudson?
Yes.
He was quite impressed with, uh, Major Nelson.
But, of course, Major Nelson wouldn't be interested.
Yeah.
Well, I mean I mean, who wants all that glamour?
Hollywood glamour.
I mean, you know, it's just, ha Yes.
Uh, why don't you get on with the report, major?
Oh, yeah.
And, uh, I am sorry.
Oh, it's all right.
Nothing at all.
I couldn't tell him.
I just couldn't tell him, Jeannie.
It would have broken his heart.
Well, what are you going to do?
Well, I don't know.
How do you tell a man he doesn't have any Have any talent?
It'd shatter him.
Just I know.
I will get Homer Xerxes to coach him.
Uh, yeah, that'll do it.
I'm sure that would cheer him up.
Yeah.
That's That's That's  Hi.
Hi.
We were just talking about you.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You know all this talk about me being a movie star.
Would you like to meet Homer Xerxes?

Uh Oh.
Oh, you didn't think I was serious, did you?
You mean, you weren't?
About being a movie star?
Yeah.
Oh, did I have you fooled.
Ha.
Oh, that is wonderful news.
I was just playing a game.
There's more important things in life than having girls chasing you around asking for your autograph.
Roger, I I can't tell you how relieved I am.
Well, we'll finish the picture Monday, and then we can get back to work again.
I wonder where I can get another job as a script supervisor.
I'll get that.

You could be the biggest thing in Hollywood.

Uh, he's dying to go back Wait, wait.
"Not interested"?
Me, the biggest thing in Hollywood?
I can get you a contract at Columbia Pictures.

Because of Major Healey.
Oh.

How are you?
This is Jeannie.
Hello.
She was going to be your leading lady.
My leading lady?
Well, I'll tell you what.
If we could back up the moon shot about seven years, maybe I could do the contract, and maybe we could work together.
And maybe we could make pictures together.
And then we could just roll over  Now, uh, R-Roge.
Now, wait a minute
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
And here, we have the Surveyor, which has already made a successful landing on the moon.
A very expensive model.
And the Lunar Orbiter spacecraft.
The Ranger A, which has made many pictures of the moon.
And here we have the Saturn V. You see, the actual flying of the capsule is a very small part of the flight.
Now, in addition to flying the spacecraft, the astronaut must observe and report on scientific data that is being collected inside and outside of the capsule.
Now, if you'll just step this way, please.
Uh, this is our new testing chamber.
Dr. Alfred Bellows will answer any questions you may have.
And I certainly hope you all have enjoy the tour.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, how many times have I told you not to come to NASA?
Anybody could walk in here.
Oh, master, I'm having a terrible time.
I cannot make up my mind.
I am redecorating the living room.
Now, which do you think will look best?
None of it.
This?
What is this?
This is not really the appropriate Or this one?
Jeannie, what are you doing?
Or this one?
N  Do you think that would look nice in the living room?
Wow!
Now, Jeannie, get rid of these things, will you?

Young lady.
Young lady.
Well, just don't sit there, call a doctor.
Dr. Bellows, you are a doctor.
Of course I am.
Well, she's breathing.
But she has no pulse.
Yes Oh, she's coming around.
How do you feel?
My professional advice would be not to answer any questions at all right now, my dear.
Are you her doctor?
No, sir.
I'm her lawyer.
How do you feel?
Oh, I am all right.
Don't say another word.
I want her examined by my personal physician.
If you don't mind, I'll examine her first.
No, nobody's gonna examine her.
What?
Well, I mean she She feels all right.
Whiplash can fool you.
Whiplash?
And concussion.
Concussion?
But really, I am just fine.
Yeah, see, she's fine, sir.
See?
Oh.
I want her taken to the hospital immediately.
Come on, Roger, can't you get anymore speed out of this thing?
We gotta get to the hospital before Dr. Bellows examines Jeannie.
I've got the accelerator on the floorboard now.
Will you relax?
So Dr. Bellows makes a few tests and takes a few x-rays.
I mean, what's the panic?
Have you got any idea what the inside of a 2000-year-old genie might look like?
Yeah, well, it probably looks like Well, you could see Let's hurry.
I'll hurry.
Excuse me.
I'm real sorry.
Roger.
Wait a minute.
Oh, go ahead, miss.
Okay.

Her name, please.
Jeannie.
Is that her first name or her last name?
Yes.
Yes, what?
Um, Dr. Bellows brought her in.
Oh, that young woman.
Yeah.
Poor thing.
What do you me?
What's the matter with her?
Her doctor will have to give you that information.
Well, give us a clue.
Is she all right or isn't she?
We're not allowed to say.
Could you give us her room number?
I'm sorry, she can't have any visitors.
Oh, I see.
Third floor.
You go that way.
Yeah.
Major Nelson.
Oh.
Yes, sir.
Oh, I was just about to call you to get over here.
We have reports to fill out.
How, when, where the accident happened.
Well, I was just on my way to see the young lady too.
Poor thing.
Poor thing?
Well, you just don't run across these things very often.
Unless, of course, she's faking.
Doctor, what's the matter with her?
I prefer not to say until I've seen the x-rays.
Oh, you've already taken the x-rays.
They'll be ready any minute.
I have the feeling that I've seen her somewhere before.
Uh, Major Healey.
What's her name?
Uh, her name?
Well, what's her name?
What's her name?
Oh, what's-her-name.
She was on the tour, wasn't she?
Her name would be on the tour list.
I didn't see it there.
She just didn't pop out of the clear blue sky, right?
Whatever you say.
I'm afraid that this Pool fellow is really trying to put one over on us.
Needless to say that Uh, yes.
Well, needless to say, the legal department of the Adjutant General's office isn't gonna look too kindly on the whole incident.
You don't have anything to worry about, sir.
I have a feeling that by this afternoon, she'll forget the whole thing.
I'm sure she will.
She's already forgotten everything else.
You mean, she's not talking.
It isn't a question of talking WOMAN : Dr. Bellows wanted in X-ray.
Oh, the x-ray's ready.
Shall we go, gentlemen?
Oh, of course, yes.
But that's impossible.
That's exactly what I said, sir, when I developed them.
But there they are.
Campbell, are you trying to tell me that the inside of that woman's head is a still photograph of your diploma?
Either that, sir, or she's hollow.
In the head, sir.
Oh, really, Campbell?
I expected a better excuse from you than that.
Well I think, perhaps There might be an explanation.
Maybe she saw the diploma, and maybe she has a photographic memory, and that's what you got the picture of.
We'll reschedule the x-rays.
All right, now, honey.
Once more.
What's your name?
I do not know.
That's great, you're doing beautifully.
But I really do not know.
That's right, play it for all it's worth.
And, honey, it's worth a small fortune.
What is?
I've had some good accident cases in my day, but this is the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.
One defenseless little girl against the entire space program.
Millions of dollars to go to the moon, but not a decent settlement for one lonely, injured little girl seeking her lost identity, here on Earth.
Honey, they'll be shoveling the money into us.
Oh, that'll probably be the press, I told them I'd make a statement.
Now, I'll see them out in the hall.
You're much too sick to have visitors.
Oh, but, uh, if you could manage a grunt or a groan that can be heard outside, it wont hurt us.
Know what I mean, honey?
Is America a democracy with a heart?
Or is it a cruel, uncaring dictatorship.
Gentlemen, inside this room lies a victim of the space age.
A beautiful, young blond.
Ruthlessly struck down by a piece of equipment destined to go to the moon.
Did I hear someone refer to this lovely child as a Moon Maid?
Let's get out of here.
No, no.
No.
No, no.
I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna I don't even have a union card.
Listen, we gotta get Jeannie out of there before Dr. Bellows takes more pictures of her head.
Yeah?
What are you gonna find?
It's transparent.
That's what I'm talking about.
What?
Why don't we just go through the door like everybody else?
Because Pool is in there, and you heard him talking to those reporters.
If he makes anymore speeches like he's been doing, he's not only gonna win a law case, he's gonna build a shrine to Jeannie.
And we're gonna be buried at the foot of it.
Now, come on.
Put this on.
The painters aren't gonna be back.
They'll be back in a few minutes.
Come on, that'll do it.
What do you need me for?
Because it takes two to get that thing up in the air.
You work the ropes from that end, and I'll handle this side.
Okay?
Go on.
When I say "now," ready?
Yeah.
Now.
Tony!
Roger, don't panic.
Roger.
Aah.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hold on!
Tony!
Roger.
Yeah, this is her room, let's go.
Wait a minute, w-what about my hair?
Well, frankly, I think it's a bit flashy, but then again, it's all a matter of taste.
Would you?
Ugh.
Sorry.
Shhh.
Shhh.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
It's all right, I'm here.
Shhh.
Jeannie, will you?
What's the matter with you?
It's me.
And me.
We've gotta get you out of here.
I'll say, and we haven't got a moment to lose.
If Dr. Bellows takes any more x-rays of you, we're in real trouble.
Where are your clothes?
Where are your clothes, huh?
I-I do not know.
Well, I'm sure you won't have any difficulty dreaming up something to wear.
D-dream up a little something to wear?
Yeah, hurry up.
We got a scaffold waiting.
A scaffold?
It's right outside the window.
Please, don't do that.
We What's gotten into you, Jeannie?
Y-you called me Jeannie?
Yeah, come on.
Let's get home, fast.
Home?
I live with you?
Well, of course you do.
Oh, I'm so happy!
Oh, I had no idea.
Well, I mean, I never thought that I would Oh, how long have we been married?
Married, who said anything about being married?
We're not married, and I live with you?
What's the matter with that?
What is the matter with that?
What kind of a girl do you think I am?
Come on, Jeannie, we know what kind of a girl you are.
Now, now, stop fooling around.
That is exactly what I intend to do.
Get out.
Jeannie, what's the matter?
Get out, or I will scream.
Can't help We're going, we're going.
Bye.
Yeah.
Oh, before you go, do you mind telling me who I am?
You don't know?
You don't know who you are?
No.
And who are you?
You know who I am.
I'm loveable Roge.
No, she doesn't know who you are, loveable Roge.
She's got amnesia.
Amnesia?
Look, Jeannie.
We're here to To help you.
I'm your friend.
So I gathered.
Huh?
Oh, no, no.
It's not what you're thinking.
Not at all.
You live with me, but you don't live with me.
Because you live in a bottle.
If you leave now, I promise not to tell them where to look for you.
No, you don't No, you don't understand.
You're a genie.
I know.
No, no.
I mean a genie, Jeannie.
And I live in a bottle.
Yeah.
And I'm your master.
Now it's clear, huh?
Very.
Give us a chance to prove it.
Yeah.
You've got very powerful powers.
Yeah.
What kind of power?
All you have to do is blink.
Yeah.
Try it.
Mm.
No, I do not think  Try it.
Very well.
If it will keep you calm.
There.
Now will you go?
No, no, no.
You don't understand.
When you blink, you have to think of something.
You have to concentrate.
I'm here to help you, Jeannie.
We're trying to rescue you.
Please try.
Rescue me.
That's right.
R-rescue me.
How did you do that?
Hast anyone here seen King Arthur?
I didn't do it, you did it.
I cannot believe my eyes.
Neither can I. Where did that knight in armor come from?
What knight in armor, sir?
Oh, that knight in armor.
Well, I just blinked, and it was there.
No, no.
We found out who she is.
You've heard of Houdini, the greatest male magician in the world?
Well, this is Jeannie, the greatest female magician.
She uses this gentleman on the horse in the act.
That's probably where you saw her, on television.
No, it isn't.
I remember where I saw her before.
Wasn't she the girl who was with you when No, no.
I don't think, she wasn't with me then, sir.
Why don't you do your big disappearing act?
Disappearing act?
You know.
On Dr. Bellows' house.
Oh, I do not think I could do Yeah, well, concentrate.
Dr. Bellows' house.
Oh, good, Jeannie.
Now he's back at his house, forgotten  Jeannie, I said house, not mouse.
Mouse?
Mouse!
I'll get him, I'll get him!
Which way did he go?
I don't know.
Somebody stop that mouse!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Dr. Bellows?
Dr. Bellows?
I beg your pardon.
Huh?
Oh, uh Have you seen a little white mouse?
A mouse?
Mm-hmm.
Don't worry, if I had, you would have hear me.
Clear to the other end of the base.
Have you seen Dr. Bellows yet?
No, no, she hasn't seen him.
Dr. Bellows?
I thought you said were looking for a mouse.
Yeah, well they kind of go together.
You see, Dr. Bellows goes with the mouse, and the mouse goes with Dr. Bellows.
Yeah.
Well, that's not exactly  Off we go Wild blue yonder  Roger, do you think?
I wouldn't dare.
Dr. Breckenridge, hi.
Major Nelson.
Major Say, these little mice wouldn't be the ones that?
Are going on that Mars probe at 1600 hours.
Yes, sir, we are going to Mars.
Aren't we, Dancer, Prancer, Dunder?
That's funny, there are five of them.
I thought we only scheduled four.
Oh, well.
Off we go Wild blue yonder Off we go Wait!
Well.
Look at you.
That's better, you look terrible.
I have found out who I am.
Shh!
Not so loud.
First we get a nice, fat settlement of, say, a million dollars, then you find out who you are.
But I have already found out who I am.
I am Jeannie the Great.
You mean like Catherine the Great?
I am a magician.
Now who told you that?
The two men who came in that window.
Two?
And then I blinked in a knight on a horse.
I'm not certain how I did that.
But it was a wonderful trick.
And then, I blinked them out again.
I'm gonna ask for $2 million.
It is wonderful.
All I do is think and blink.
Now, we'll get you the best psychiatric care in the world.
We'll send you to Vienna.
What is a Vienna?
Sure.
Now, look, you just stay calm.
I'll get Dr. Bellows.
Oh, I blinked him into a little white mouse.
Three million dollars.
Oh.
How is the patient?
Terrible, doc.
Don't let anything happen to her, she's my first legitimate case.
Oh, it is you again?
Don't Don't scream again.
Oh, I am not going to scream.
Jeannie, we need your help.
You've got to get Dr. Bellows back.
Do you realize in an hour and 14 seconds, Dr. Bellows is going to be on his way to Mars in a cage?
You gotta bring him back.
But I do not know how to bring him back.
Yeah, well, of course you do.
After all, you're a genie.
Genie in a bottle.
Yeah, that's right.
You don't believe me.
No.
Jeannie, look, I don't have time to argue.
Just trust me.
Please.
Very well.
What is it you wish me to do?
All you have to do is think "Bellows" and blink.
Think "Bellows," blink.
Yeah, that's all.
Just think "Bellows" and blink.
You got the wrong bellows.
Well, I am sorry.
I am rather tired.
Perhaps if we try it again tomorrow.
No, Jeannie, we don't have time for that.
Please.
Just try once more.
I'll concentrate with you, okay?
I'll form a picture in my mind, and you blink.
Roger!
Well, I tried to think of Dr. Bellows.
All right, let's try the word-association game.
Dr. Bellows is on his way to Mars, and you wanna play games.
Roger, this might trigger her into remembering who she is.
Oh, I get it.
We name some people and some places, and we get her memory going.
Yeah, right.
Yeah?
Well, where do we start?
She's been around a long time.
That is a terrible thing to say.
He didn't mean anything by it, Jeannie.
Now, I'm gonna mention some names and see if it helps you remember, okay?
Uh, Julius Caesar.
No.
Napoleon Bonaparte.
No.
Genghis Khan.
No.
Uh Millard Fillmore.
What?
Well, he was the 13th president of the United States.
What's wrong with Millard Fillmore?
Will you just drive?
Uh Uh, Mark Antony.
No.
Cleopatra.
No.
Turn on the radio, they're broadcasting the launch.
Why don't we think of some places?
MAN : Fifteen minutes to countdown.
All systems to go.
Places, places.
Uh, Paris.
No.
Berlin.
Mm-mmm.
Madrid.
No.
How about Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga?
Only five minutes more.
Ah, poor Dr. Bellows.
We should have sent him some cheese.
Stop.
Stop the car.
Stop the car.
What?
I am.
There's a telephone booth.
Pull over there, will you?
Wait a minute.
Hold on.
Right here, will you?
What are you doing?
I'm gonna call the launch pad and have them stop the launch.
Oh.
Roger, give me a dime, will you?
All right, all right.
What are you doing?
They're not gonna stop the launching.
Look, we don't have the time.
She is obviously not going to regain her memory.
Give me the dime.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I got it.
She lost her memory when she was hit on the head.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, why, all we have to do is take this and maybe Give me the dime.
All right, I'll give you the dime, it was just a suggestion.
Ooh!
Oh, God.
Jeannie, speak to me.
Are you all right, huh?
Wha?
What happened?
Well, you got hit Master.
Oh, where are we?
You're all right, you got your memory back.
I was showing you some statues, and then I got hit Roger.
Roger.
Oh, Major Healey!
Oh, Major Healey.
Roger.
Roger, are you all right?
Here, sit up.
Talk to me.
Say something.
Who are you?
Oh.
Get Dr. Bellows back.
Blink now.
Get him back.
Dr. Bellows?
What happened?
What hap?
You came to the testing chamber, and you were trying to show I can't go into it, Jeannie.
Just blink him back.
MAN : And there it goes.
It's a beautiful launch.
It's going way up.
And it's up in the blue, and it looks like a perfect shot.
MAN : And as the Mars probe launch was a success this afternoon, so was the strange sea rescue out in the Pacific today.
Although the explanation is still forthcoming, Dr. Alfred Bellows of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration was plucked safely from somewhere in the middle of the Pacific Ocean today.
How did he get there?
Nobody seems to know.
Not even Dr. Bellows, who is still in somewhat of a state of shock.
However, he is expected to recover quickly and perhaps the mystery will be cleared up then.
You're sure you're all right, Roge?
Oh, you mean the?
You mean the loss of memory?
Well, that was just a temporary thing.
Well, Dr. Bellows is all right, and you're all right, so Yeah, well, I'm a little tired.
Why don't you go on home?
Oh, okay, sure.
Well, goodbye, Major Healey.
I'm very sorry that I caused you so much trouble.
That's all right, Jeannie.
Thanks for everything.
Bye.
I'll see you, Roge.
Uh, you don't want us to order dinner?
No thanks.
Bye-bye.
Major Healey.
My name is Pool.
I'm sure you remember.
I've been going over your case.
And I see here an opportunity for us Uh, for me, for us, to make a great deal of money.
Could you hold that?
If you just give me your signature, then I will have you
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
More coffee, master?
Uh, no, thanks.
No.
How long have you been making coffee anyway?
Oh, about 2000 years.
Hm.
Nobody is perfect.
Oh, there's the mailman.
Yeah, I I will get it.
Uh Here is one marked, "Open carefully.
Personal.
Very private".
Oh, okay.
Yeah, I wonder who that could be from.
There's nothing in here.
It says, "Dear occupant, "here is your lucky do-or-die sweepstakes number.
You may already have won a trip to sunny Spain".
Oh, would you like to win, master?
No, I've already been to sunny Spain.
Oh.
It rained.
Oh, here's a letter from your mother.
No kidding, third one this week.
Poor thing, she worries about you.
Yeah, I know.
It's getting to be a hobby of hers.
"Dear Anthony, I just heard on the radio "they're having a cold spell in Florida.
I hope you don't have a drafty capsule".
Oh, that's sweet.
You must write her and tell her that you are well.
Yeah, listen to this.
"I-I hope you don't have a drafty cap "Why can't you be an astronaut up here in Bridgeport where you can eat lunch at home"?
Oh, she misses you, master.
Listen to this.
"Under separate cover"  Oh, um, "Under separate cover.
"I am sending vitamin pills, uh, gelatin pills, "and a few minerals I had lying around the house.
"Your loving mother.
P.S. Bridgeport is lovely this time of year".
Aw.
Would you mind, please?
Thanks.
Surprise!
Mom.
Well Well Well, what are you doing here?
Oh, I was just passing by.
I got lonely.
Oh, well.
Well You're just passing by.
Well, Bridgeport is a thousand miles from here, Mom.
Oh, do you think it's right for a mother to be separated from her son by a thousand miles?
Let me look at you.
You look terrible.
That service haircut, and you look so thin.
Well, I brought everything for you.
Yeah?
Uh, organically grown food.
Herbs I-I thought you said you were sending this under a separate cover.
Separate cover decided to deliver.
Oh, I worry about you, Anthony.
But no more.
If the mountain won't come to Mohammed, then Mohammed comes to the mountain.
That mountain's gonna get crowded, Ma.
And I'm here.
Good.
To stay.
Wonderful.
Permanently.
Permanently.
P-permanently?
You know, Mohammed is kidding.
Mother, I really would love to have you stay, but I'm kind of short of room.
Oh, whenever did a mother need room?
Oh, this place is a mess.
But as soon as I unpack, I'll clean it up.
Oh, it's a lovely house, Anthony.
But it certainly needs a woman's touch.
Hm.
Looks as if it hadn't been dusted for a year.
Yeah, well, Mother, there's no reason for you to bother with that.
Why don't you act like a guest?
Oh, whoever heard of a mother as a guest?
Yes, well Oh-ho.
Dust, dust, dust.
You are a typical bachelor, Anthony.
Sloppy.
I'll just unpack.
See the dust?
Well, you certainly have a cool ocean breeze.
I think it's the beginning of Hurricane Jeannie.
You could catch cold.
Look.
Huh?
Where?
Over there.
What is it?
Oh, that poor little plant, it's dying.
Dying just like a dog.
Well, it's lucky I got here on time.
Yeah.
And no more hurricanes, you understand?
Yes, master.
But there was no dust.
Shhh.
To a mother, there was dust.
Yes, master.
We have to make her as comfortable as possible while she's here.
Where do you keep the vacuum cleaner?
I vacuumed it myself this morning!
Shh!
Jeannie, please.
Uh, don't bother, Mother.
Look, all we have to do is convince her that I'm well cared for, and she'll go home.
Ha.
That is impossible.
Your house is too dirty, your hair is too short, you are too thin.
Yeah, look, she's my mother.
Let's just humor her while she's here, hm?
Okay?
Yes, master.
I can't I can't Oh, she would love that.
Would you please come get me out of this quickly?
Oh, but you look so much better.
Get me out of this Come on.
I mean it.
That's better.
That's much better.
Now, you.
Go, go on, get out.
Oh.
Please?
Anthony, I'm going to get us a little lunch.
Oh.
Ah.
How can anyone live just on ice cubes?
Just lucky, I guess.
It's amazing you haven't starved to death without me to look after you.
No bread.
No fruit.
Sorry, Mom.
No vegetables.
Mom, I I've already set the table.
We can have lunch.
Oh!
You had it set in.
Yes.
Well, it's cold.
A man should have a hot meal in the middle of the day.
Mustard?
Thank you.
Oh, that'll be fine.
Mother, I wish you'd let me take the couch and you take my bed.
I wouldn't dream of it.
But I want you to be comfortable.
A mother doesn't have to be comfortable.
Well, then be uncomfortable in my bed.
I'll be uncomfortable in the way I want to be uncomfortable.
Okay, but you call me if you change your mind, Mom.
Yes, dear.
Good night.
Good night.
Now you get to bed.
An astronaut needs his sleep.
Okay, Mom.
Oh, my.
I shall sleep tight tonight.
Anthony!
Anthony!
What is it?
What is it, Ma?
There is a door under my sheet.
A door?
Oh, you sweet boy.
You remembered about your mother's bad back.
So thoughtful of you.
You remembered that I always slept on a board.
How could I forget?
Oh, there aren't many sons who would think of a door for their mother's bed.
No, not many, Ma.
There.
Let me help you.
Now, I shall sleep tight tonight.
Nothing's going to wake me now.
Good.
Oh, here.
Ah.
Thank you, dear.
Good night.
Good night.
Ma?
Mom?
Ma?
Oh, Anthony?
What is it, dear?
Do you want something to eat?
No.
What was that racket?
I was dreaming.
What a dream I had.
We were in Bridgeport, right in the main street.
And they were giving you a parade.
Oh, it was beautiful.
Ticker tape, trumpets, drums, cymbals.
Boom!
I thought I heard a A cannon.
Imagine, a parade for my son.
Anthony the Astronaut.
Tony the Tired.
Oh, dear, why, of course you are after all that excitement.
Now, you go right back to sleep.
Okay.
Good night, Ma.
Sweet dreams.
Good night.
Sleep tight.
Yeah.
Why aren't you married?
What?
I-I brought some things, um, for you to see.
Do you remember Daphne?
Daphne?
Yes.
She was the athletic one.
Oh, you used to canter off into the woods together.
Do you remember?
Well, not at 3:00 in the morning I don't, Mom.
Or perhaps it's Eleanor you remember.
Eleanor.
With the adorable freckles.
Freckles.
Don't you remember her?
Yes, she always wanted to be a nurse.
Oh, what a beauty.
Mom, I really gotta get some sleep, come on.
I'll bet it's Eleanor you remember.
We'll talk about it in the morning.
Good night.
How many times have I told you not to come in here without knocking?
What is it?
Oh.
Uh, nothing.
Good night, darling.
W-what's the matter with you?
I have a mother-in-law problem.
You can't have a mother-in-law problem.
We're not married.
I gotta get some sleep.
How long is she going to stay?
I don't know.
I think she's moved in.
Well, I do not think there's room enough for all of us here.
Let me worry about this.
You got plenty of room in your bottle.
Just go pop in.
I gotta get some sleep.
I'm exhausted.
Very well.
What the?
Doctor, it's so nice of you to drop in to see me.
Not all, Mrs. Nelson, I've been looking forward to meeting Tony's mother.
Oh, thank you.
I've been so worried about Tony.
So have I. And frankly, I'm relieved that you're here.
Are you?
I've known your son for some time now and I feel that he could use a sort of sober helping hand.
You mean a mother's hand?
Yes.
And you're so beautifully normal.
Yes, I'm just as normal as Anthony is.
Oh, he's such a darling.
Do you know, last night he had me sleeping on a door?
He had you sleep on a door?
He is so thoughtful.
Oh, of course, he's just an average son.
I'm just an average mother.
I'd like to be an average grandmother.
Oh, I'm sure that will come in time.
He needs some nice girl who would look after him properly.
He can't go on living in this dust bowl.
I think it's getting a little misty in here.
Perhaps if I If I close the windows?
Oh, uh, they're closed.
Would you have an apricot cookie?
Oh, yes, thank you.
I, uh I can't see them.
I made them myself this morning.
Where are they?
You know, if it wasn't for me Anthony would never have a home-cooked meal.
The last time I was in a fog like this was at sea on the Atlantic.
Oh, really?
Did you have a nice crossing?
We were afraid of hitting an iceberg.
We never have fogs like this in Bridgeport.
I've never heard of a fog inside a house.
Neither have I. Isn't it splendid?
Splendid?
You don't mind it?
Oh, not at all.
Don't you know?
It's marvelous for the complexion.
Yes, well, I think I'll be running along.
So soon?
Well, yes, I'm afraid so.
Let me get you a hot cup of tea.
You know, I wanted to discuss Anthony with you.
Oh, what was that?
Sounded like a foghorn.
In the living room?
Oh, doctor.
You backed into the teapot.
Oh, excuse me, I, uh Perhaps you could, uh, steer me in the right direction.
Oh, certainly.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, here we are.
I do hope you'll come again on a clear day.
Yes, another time, yes, when I've consulted my barometer first.
Oh.
Oh.
Ooh!
Whoa!
Oh, I'm sorry you don't like fog.
Well Oh!
Well, I've never been crazy about it.
Oh, uh, excuse me, I had a hat, Mrs. Nelson.
I'll get it.
Yeah, right over there.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I don't understand.
It's sunny.
There's no fog out there.
Now, now, doctor.
It's best not to get emotional about the weather.
Yes.
Good day.
Good day.
Psychiatrists.
Always something a little peculiar.
Oh, hi, Ma.
Smells great.
I'm cooking all of your favorite dishes.
Just as I did when you were a little boy.
Oh, well, I don't want you to go to all this trouble.
I'll take you out for dinner.
Out?
Oh, you don't like my fried chicken.
And apple dumplings.
Oh, no With plenty of sugar and spice.
I love it, I do.
It's just that Oh!
You'd like to get out of the house?
Yeah, I sure would, yeah.
All right.
We'll take it with us.
Take it where?
To the beach.
We'll have a picnic.
Okay, sure, just the two of us, huh?
That's a wonderful idea.
I can't go out of the house with my hair like this.
Well, it looks fine.
It's a mess.
No.
Give me a mirror.
Well, Mom, I can't get you Oh, here.
Why, it looks as if I have sequins over my eyebrows.
Yes, well, that's the atmospheric conditions combined with the kreptactic light sequentials.
Kreptactic light sequentials.
Isn't science wonderful?
It's nice.
Yeah, it looks fine.
You know, Anthony?
There's something about the Cocoa Beach climate that is amazing.
Yeah, it's enough to curl your hair.
More chicken, Anthony?
Oh, Mom, I couldn't.
Oh, you've scarcely eaten anything.
Four pieces of chicken, a half pound of potato salad and three apple dumplings?
It's getting a little chilly.
Why don't you put on your jacket, dear?
No, I'm not cold, Ma.
Oh, you need some nice girl to look after you.
Some nice, old-fashioned girl.
Oh, I had the most marvelous dream last night.
I dreamt that you met the perfect girl.
She was blond and beautiful.
She could cook, she could sew and bright.
She wore thick glasses.
You could see that she was fond of children.
And what a sense of humor.
Well, Ma, you can't take dreams too seriously.
There she is.
That's the girl.
Isn't she lovely?
Yeah.
Cooks, sews and is intelligent.
I beg your pardon, miss.
But would you tell me where you are from?
Bridgeport.
Bridgeport.
Anthony, did you hear that?
May I see your left hand?
You aren't married.
Tell me you aren't married.
I can tell you, she's not married.
Oh, my.
Do I have an astronaut for you.
Are you sure you don't wanna stay for just a few more days, Ma?
Oh, now that you have met Jeannie, I feel that I can leave you alone.
She'll take very good care of you.
Oh, I will take very good care of him.
Well, I don't see why you have to just rush off, you know.
Oh, I was going to keep it for a secret.
But this morning, I received a special delivery letter from Bridgeport.
I won the do-or-die sweepstakes.
Oh.
A free trip to sunny Spain.
Yeah.
Isn't that exciting?
Yeah.
I've never been to Spain.
I just can't wait.
It's gonna be wonderful for you, Mother.
Major Nelson.
Ah-ah!
Not here.
Oh, well, I will go upstairs and see if you left anything there.
Yeah, I'll go with you.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Come in, doctor.
Ah.
Oh, well, hello, Mrs. Nelson.
Forgive me for barging in like this, but I, uh I heard you were leaving, and I just want another chance to exam I mean, to wish you bon voyage.
Oh, how kind of you, doctor.
Thank you.
Uh, doctor, I must tell you.
Anthony has found the most wonderful girl.
Nothing serious, I hope.
What do you mean?
Well, uh, forgive me, but in my opinion, your son is not ready for marriage.
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you some flowers for your trip, Mrs. Nelson.
Oh, how thoughtful.
I, uh How delightful.
I hope they match your dress.
I always How wonderful.
Onions.
Onions?
Scallions.
Oh, how thoughtful.
I saw them put carnations in the box.
I smelled the carnations.
Did you?
Yes.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
There's something about this house.
I must be going.
It's happening again.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I'll wait for you outside, okay?
Okay.
Good morning, Mrs. Bellows.
Oh!
Major Healey.
Oh!
Mrs. Bellows.
For once Alfred was right.
He told me you were here in the gymnasium.
Why don't we talk outside?
Women are not allowed in the gym.
Oh, don't be so stuffy, major.
My husband's a doctor.
Now, where's Major Nelson?
Well, you can't see him right now Of course, I can see him.
There he is.
Oh, Mrs. Bellows.
Mrs. Bellows?
Oh, Major Nelson.
Oh!
Hello, Mrs. Bellows.
Hello, I've been looking for you everywhere.
Now, boys, I must talk to both of you immediately.
I've got some marvelous news for you.
Oh, well, couldn't it wait?
I mean No, no, no, it can't wait.
Now listen, I'm going to be chairman for the benefit ball at the hospital Saturday, and the press is screaming for the guest list.
I'm gonna need both of you desperately.
Well, I'm afraid we're pretty busy.
Yeah, we're kind of I'm going to have dozens of beautiful unattached females there.
What time Saturday night?
Ooh, I knew I could count on both of you.
It's gonna be the swankiest event of the entire season.
And to top it off, I have arranged to have as our guest the most glamorous movie star in all of Hollywood.
A movie star?
Yes, Bootsie Nightingale!
Bootsie Nightingale.
Boys, I've so much to do.
I'll see you later.
Goodbye.
Bootsie Nightingale?
Here on the base?
I can't believe it.
What are you getting so excited about?
What am I getting excited?
Bootsie Nightingale?
Y-you mean you're not excited?
Roger, she's just a girl.
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.
Tony.
Yeah?
Bootsie Nightingale.
Boy, I've always been crazy about her.
Yeah.
Sounds like Mrs. Bellows cooked up a swinging affair for a change.
Yeah, you may have a problem.
What do you mean?
Well, Jeannie.
You and all those beautiful women?
She probably won't even let you go.
Oh.
Don't worry about Jeannie.
I'll take care of her.
How?
I'll lie.
I have to go, Jeannie.
It's It's business.
I really don't want to.
Well, if the benefit party is not any fun, master, why do they call it a ball?
It's just an expression.
People give these parties to raise money, and everybody goes and has a terrible time.
Well, I do not want you to have a terrible time.
Thanks.
So, I will go too.
Huh?
I'll take charge of the entertainment.
I'll have elephants, jugglers, clowns, lions and tigers And I'll have a full-fledged general court-martial.
No, thank you very much.
It's very kind of you, Jeannie, but I'll just have to suffer for one night.
Oh, master, you are so brave.
Yeah, well sometimes we all have to give a little extra.
Bootsie, baby, please.
It's a benefit for a hospital at the Space Center in Florida.
You're boring me, sweetie.
But every big shot in the space program will be there.
Don't you understand?
Think of your career.
I'm gonna have a career in space?
The newspapers, television, radio, there'll be reporters and photographers all over the place.
And there you'll be, sweetheart, looking beautiful and gorgeous telling them about your next picture, huh?
Now, you gotta do this.
Would I be the greatest manager in the business if I didn't know what I was talking about, now would I?
Kiss Herman.
Oh, I don't wanna kiss Herman.
Now, would you listen to me, Bootsie?
I got a great idea that's gonna get your picture on the front page of every newspaper in the country.
You will be America's sweetheart.
Kiss Herman.
Ain't you even gonna ask me what the great idea is?
Will you ask me already?
What's the great idea?
You know what you're gonna do at the benefit ball at the Space Center, huh?
You're gonna get yourself engaged to a handsome astronaut.
Huh?
Oh!
Oh, we love it!
Have a good day, master.
Oh, I'm gonna have a wonderful day, Jeannie.
Hi, Jeannie.
Hi.
Hello, Major Healey.
Oh, no fireworks, huh?
Fireworks?
Of course not.
Then it's all right about Saturday night?
Let's go, Roger.
Oh, you mean about the ball?
Of course.
I am going to stay home, and Major Nelson will go.
Yeah, well, you sure have the all-American know-how.
Yeah, let's go.
Bootsie Nightingale, here we come.
Yeah.
See you later.
What is a Bootsie Nightingale?
Oh, um, uh, tell her, Roge.
Oh, didn't you tell her about Bootsie Nightingale?
No.
Oh, Bootsie Nightingale is an award.
It's an Oscar.
The movies have their Oscars, and the, uh, TV have their Emmys.
And the hospital benefits have their Bootsie Nightingales.
Yeah, that That's right.
Wh-what do you think of that?
Not much.
All right, Bootsie is a Roge, um Bootsie Nightingale is a movie star.
And she's gonna be a guest at the benefit ball.
Now you're in trouble.
No, don't be silly.
Jeannie understands about these things, don't you, Jeannie?
Oh, yes.
That is why you are in trouble.
I will not let you go to a party with a movie star.
Oh, I'm not going with Bootsie Nightingale.
I may not even meet her.
There'll be a hundred people there.
A hundred and one.
No, you're not going.
Oh, but why?
Well, because I have a A lot of the guests to take care of.
Yeah, and there's going to be a lot of guests that need taking care of.
And you will not be with this Footsie Nightingale?
"Bootsie".
Bootsie Nightingale.
I'm afraid the old girl will just have to find herself another escort.
She's old?
Uh, she used to play opposite Rudolph Valentino.
Rudolph Valentino?
Aristophanes.
Oh.
She is old.
Well, I'll I'll see you later.
But I have never been to a benefit ball!
Master.
I just remembered, I have a perfect dress to wear.
It was designed by Cleopatra, and Mark Antony loved it.
Oh, well, let him give a party for you.
You're not coming to this one.
Now, where are you, Jeannie?
Is it because you would be ashamed of me?
Ah, you know that's not the reason.
You know that.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Well, you know how I feel about you.
I'd never be ashamed to take you any place.
I bet you'd look beautiful in Cleopatra's gown.
Maybe you can wear it some other time.
Maybe she'll give If you're busy with Cleopatra, I can come back.
No, sir.
I wasn't speaking I was just speaking out loud actually.
Oh, yes.
Do you talk to Cleopatra very often?
No.
No, I wasn't speaking to Cleopatra.
I was, let me explain You don't have to explain, major.
Psychologically, it's very healthy to act out your little fantasies.
Say hello for me, won't you?
I've always been the great admirer of hers.
Uh, what'd you say?
Nothing.
Thanks, thanks very much.
Oh, thanks.
Now, colonel, it's very important that we get the right guy to escort Bootsie.
Now, I need a fellow with a lot of zing.
You know what I mean, colonel?
I-I-I want a fun astronaut.
Fun astronaut.
With a lot of pizzazz.
A lot of pizzazz.
And good-looking and a little bit offbeat, you know what I mean, colonel?
A-a-a Colorful.
You got anybody here this-that's got a lot of color?
I have just the man you're looking for, Mr. Dawkin.
Oh, uh, sergeant.
Tell Major Nelson I want to see him.
Colonel, are you ready for this?
That's Bootsie.
You can certainly see she has talent.
Major Nelson, you're escorting Miss Nightingale to the benefit ball.
Oh, um well, I think you'd better get somebody else, sir.
Oh, he's really colorful.
What's the matter with you?
You've got something against beautiful women?
Oh, no.
It's just that I don't think I deserve what's gonna happen to me.
He's modest.
It's all settled, major.
Um, sir, I'd really appreciate it if you would reconsider.
No, Major Nelson.
Consider it an order.
Um, but this is a social affair.
Now, surely NASA can't order me This order did not come from NASA, Major Nelson.
It came from the top.
The president?
Higher than that.
My wife.
You look so handsome, master.
Well, thank you, Jeannie.
Do you know who you should take tonight?
No, no.
Who?
Bootsie Nightingale.
What, uh?
What made you say that?
I feel sorry for her.
An old woman all alone at a party with no one to talk to.
If you were her escort, think how exciting it would be.
Yeah, I've thought.
I've thought.
She would never get over it.
Yeah, a lot of us would have a hard time getting over it.
Why don't you stay at home now and forget about the party and have a wonderful time looking at television, huh?
Yes, master.
I'll get it.
It's probably Roger.
I'll fight you for her.
Huh?
I just heard you have a date with the girl I'm going to marry.
Keep your voice down.
You steal the most beautiful woman in the world away from me?
You want me to keep my voice down?
Easy.
Well, gee, I have a mind to tell her the whole truth, that would fix you.
That would fix everybody.
Good evening, Major Healey.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
You forgot this, master.
Oh, thank you, Jeannie.
I wish you were not going to have such a terrible time.
Terrible time?
Oh, with the party?
Yes.
Yeah, well, I wish I were going to the dentist.
Roger, let's go.
We'll see you later.
Bye.
Bye.
Boy, you really got her eating out of your hands.
Yeah, but I have to keep counting my fingers.
Come on.
Are you sure he's cute, Sam?
Bootsie, how many times do I have to tell you, honey?
He's adorable.
He's divine, and he's all man.
Ooh.
That's the way I like 'em.
You got me all excited, Sam.
I can hardly wait to meet him.
And he's on his way up.
Oh, he's here!
Hello, there.
I've been waiting for you.
I'm Major Anthony Nelson.
And you're Bootsie Nightingale?
Well.
I've certainly been looking forward to meeting you.
I must have caught a slight cold.
This is all man?
He didn't talk like that before.
Well, if you think I'm going out with him, you're out of your ever-loving mind.
But I assure you, this is just temporary.
I think I know someone who can cure this almost instantly.
I think, if you could just be patient.
He sounds like he escaped from a cartoon.
Get him out of here.
B-but listen I'm sorry, major.
Why don't you go home and come back when you're feeling better.
I can  Nothing personal.
But this is not m-my voice.
What is your next false move?
Wait.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, I know you're here.
You're around here someplace.
Dr. Bellows gave Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Tony, where you been?
I've been waiting in that car for hours.
Wh-where's Bootsie?
Oh, she's in there.
Listen, I came to pick her up, and listen what happened to my voice?
Very funny.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, where are you?
Better count your fingers.
Hello.
I'm Major Healey.
Oh, come in.
Come in.
Say something.
I love you.
He'll do.
Yeah, Major, how would you like to escort Miss Nightingale to the benefit ball tonight?
Jeannie, it was my fault.
I didn't tell you the whole Roger!
Roger.
Tell her that this voice condition is just temporary.
Go ahead, tell her.
Tell her.
Poor devil, that's what happens when you're up in space too long.
Wai Aah!
She's a sweet little old lady.
Jeannie, get rid of this voice.
Voice.
Now, do you know what you've done?
Yes, master.
If you will excuse me now, I must get dressed.
I am going to my first charity ball!
Oh, no, you're not.
Well.
Here we are.
Yes, we certainly are.
You know, I could spend the rest of my life looking at you.
Oh, I dig you too.
I mean it was like, wow, pow!
The first time I set eyes on you Robert.
It's R-Roger.
Yes.
And you can call me Bootsie, baby.

Excuse me, have you seen Major Nelson?
Who?
She means Mickey Mouse.
Mickey Mouse?
Pardon me, Alfred?
Oh, excuse me, Neil.
Darling, where is Major Nelson?
Oh, isn't he with Miss Nightingale?
No, Miss Nightingale is with Major Healey.
Well, I arranged for Major Nelson to be her escort.
Something must have gone wrong.
What do you mean?
Well, Miss Nightingale just called Major Nelson Mickey Mouse.
Mickey Mouse?
Why would she call him that?
I don't know.
But I smell a rat.
Oh!
Let's go look for him, darling.
Yes.
No, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Now, let's see I'm sorry.
That's okay.
There.
Good evening, master, darling.
Do you like my new dress?

What can't you get over, baby?
Me sitting here with you.
Holding my hand?
H-holding your h-hand.
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
I guess I'm a little nervous.
You nervous?
Why, I bet you just drive all the girls wild with your animal magnetism.
Well, I wouldn't say I drive them wild If there's anything I love, it's a modest hero.
I just get chills all over thinking about those planets you go to.
Mars and Juniper and J-J-Jupiter.
Yes, and Venus.
Venus, the planet of love.
After we're engaged, you'll have to stay on the ground.
Well, I can't stay on the ground.
You see, we're working on this Apollo mission and to the moon After we're engaged?
If that's what you want.
If that's what I want?
I want what you want.
Right now, I want you to get off my foot.
I'm sorry.

I ripped your dress.
I'll get the maid to sew it up.
Don't move.
Stay right there.

That's why.
What?
We're engaged.
I'm engaged to Bootsie Nightingale.
We're going to get married.
What are you talking about?
I can't understand it myself.
I swept her off her feet.
Hey, everything a-o?
What happened to you?
I'll tell you what happened to me.
That astronaut happened to me.
Ten-to-one, he'll knock down the moon.
Lower your voice.
You're talking about your fiancÃ©.
Are you kidding me?
I'll go back to television first.
Don't, uh Don't even say that in jest.
I've already hinted to the press that you'll marry the astronaut.
They don't grow on bushes, you know.
Oh, that's all I needed.
Now, here comes Mickey Mouse.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
I wanted to explain Your voice.

I go to sleep every night with your picture under my pillow.
I, uh I I'll bet you drive all the girls wild with your animal magnetism.
I-I beg your pardon?
If there's anything I love, it's a modest hero.
I get chills all over thinking of those planets you go to.
Mars and Juniper  Jupiter.
And Venus.
Venus, the planet of love.

He was under the impression He's a boy.
Yeah, well, he's old enough to I like men.

Have you heard from Major Healey this morning, master?

Major Healey falls in love very easily, does he not?
Yeah, that he does.
Hi, Roger Hi, Tony.
Hi, Jeannie.
We were just talking about you.
Good morning, Major Healey.

Me unhappy?
Oh, you don't think I took that seriously, do you?
Didn't you?
You've got to learn to know me better.
You don't think I was impressed with the Hollywood phony glamour.
She was just another blond.
Good, good.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
No, thank you.
I'm in kind of a hurry.
I have a fellow waiting outside.
Tony, can I borrow your car?
What's the matter with yours?

Thanks for the dinner.
Oh, it was nothing.
Have a good time.
Thank you.
I will.
Well, good night sis.
He's gone.
Oh, yes.
If only I could tell him why I must leave.
And have him beg you to stay?
Oh, believe me, darling, the best thing for you to do is to go on back home and don't say a word to him.
But he is already suspicious.
He's wondering why I'm introducing beautiful girls to him.
Yes.
I'd like to know too.
I am doing it because I cannot bear the thought of him being alone all those years.
I must get him married before I leave.
Get him?
Good thinking, good thinking.
My, when they passed out brains in our family, they really gave you an extra helping.
Thank you.
She's incredible.
Imagine, a genie believing in jinxes.
Well, time to go to work.
Thanks so much for bringing me home.
My pleasure.
Will I see you again?
Well, I, uh, certainly  Oh!
Oh!
Not if I can help it, darling.
Wait!
Oh!
Oh!
And you think I did it?
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.
A-are you sure you didn't get jealous Oh, of course not, master.
I wanted you to go out with her.
All I was doing is standing there saying good night, and the whole trellis fell down on top of me.

Yeah, I I guess they don't build trellises the way they used to, huh?
Do you like her, master?
Huh?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
She's a very nice girl.
Then you will see her again tomorrow night.

I forgot it's Helen's birthday, and, uh, she loves perfume.
Major, it's been opened.
Yes, I I know, but it's It's the sentiment that counts.
She's very sentimental.
Well, if you think she'd like an unwrapped, open bottle of someone else's perfume, go right ahead.
That's very kind of you.
Would you like the box?
Oh, major.
I don't know what's the matter with you tonight.
Now, look It's It's 9:00, sir.
So?
Well, I've been working for three and a half weeks on the Sagittarius project.

We'll do it again.
Good night.

Darling, do you really think you're helping the major?
Hmm.
Jeannie, I got her.
Jeannie!
Yes, master.
Oh.
I got her.
Oh, how wonderful.
Safely locked away.
When are we going to let her out?
We're not gonna let her out.
You're gonna put her someplace where we won't have to worry about her again.
Oh, but master Wait a minute.
I went through a lot of trouble to catch that young girl.
You get rid of her.
Put her someplace where we won't have to see her for 2000 years.
Oh, well, I cannot do that, master.
But I have a better idea.
What?
There, we will mail her back to her master in Baghdad.
Oh, you look beautiful, master.
Oh, thank you.
I suppose you will be going to the Surf for dinner.
Mm-hm.
And then perhaps dancing and a-a drive along the beach.
That's right.
It is a beautiful night for it.

Full moon.
Have a wonderful time.
I will.
A-and do not worry about getting home early.
I won't.
I will be fine.

Oh, what does the old computer know?
Who is it?
Me.
Master.
Well, aren't you dressed yet?
They're not gonna hold a table.
It's a very busy restaurant.
But I thought You know I hate to have a date keep me waiting.
Now will you hurry up?
Oh, master.
Oh, I am so happy.
Jeannie.
The next time you wanna know who's right for me don't ask a machine.
Ask me.
Who is it?
Me.
Oh, it's Roge.
Hi.
Hi, Roge.
Hi.
You sure have a sweet-smelling mailbox.
Look what just I found, a bottle of perfume.
No, don't open Whoa!
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
No, major.
For the 10th time, the answer is no.
I-I really don't think it's a terribly good idea, sir.
I honestly believe I could accomplish a lot more work at the office.
Oh, uh, nonsense.
Phone ringing constantly, people running in and out with questions.
This report is important, and I want you to have a place completely free of distractions.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
There's that report I was looking for.
Now, this should come in very handy.
Besides, General Burger wants the report by the end of the week.
And that means we're all under the gun.
Yes, sir.
Well, uh, I see.
If we could take three days, we might be able to finish.
Not might, major.
Must.
Now, uh Uh, just think of yourself as being chained to a worktable.
Sir?
Well, that always helped me.
Oh, all right.
Well, uh, good luck.
Thanks.
Oh, uh  Oh, uh And, uh, remember: No distractions.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Do not worry, master.
I heard Dr. Bellows.
But with my help, you will be finished with your report in five minutes.
Then we can go to the beach.
There's a lovely beach in Jamaica with a white sand, and blue water and little fishes.
Yeah.
No, no, no.
Jeannie, this kind of work is not in your line.
You do not want my help?
Mm.
No.
No.
And the sooner I get started, the sooner Here, would you hold that?
The sooner I'll finish.
Tsk.
Yes, master.
But at least I can help you get started.
Yeah.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, what are you?
There.
Oh.
There.
Now you are ready to work, master.
I will go make you some fresh Turkish coffee.
Oh.
Thank you.
Oh, I forgot, the report has to be, uh Well  You are plunging in, aren't you?
Yes, well, I didn't wanna waste any time, sir.
I Can I help you?
Major Nelson, when I said chained to your worktable, it was just a figure of speech.
Yeah.
Well.
I just got carried away, sir.
Well, it may not be a bad idea.
Huh?
Oh, uh, nothing.
Uh, what I came back to tell you was that Gen.
Burger wants the report in triplicate.
In triplicate?
Yes.
Yes.
Well, good luck.
Thank you.
Heh-heh.
Chain on your leg.
Here's your coffee, master.
Yeah.
Thank you Jeannie, would you just remove the chain, please?
Oh, but master, Dr. Bellows said Well, I just don't think it's fair for you to do everything for me.
Oh.
But that is a genie's job, to help her master.
Please take this off.
Please?
Oh, yes, master.
Now what else would you like me to do for you, master?
Oh.
I don't know.
Why don't you go take a walk?
Or, uh Here.
Read a book.
That's a pretty interesting technical book.
Uh, anything.
Just Just as long as you leave me alone.
I Why don't you go help somebody else, huh?
Someone else?
Who?
Yeah.
Well, I don't know.
I know.
Someone without a genie.
Yeah.
Oh, it would be great fun.
I will find a stranger and solve his problem.
All right.
Oh, thank you, master.
Yeah, good.
Good, good.
You go find a stranger and help him.
Find a stranger?
No, Jeannie, you wouldn't do that.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
!
No, no, baby.
You didn't do your part.
Mommy throws the stick and you bring it back.
Mommy threw it.
But you didn't bring it here.
I wish you could tell Mommy where the stick is.
In the bushes, stupid.
That's no way to talk to Mommy.
You talked to Mommy.
But you can't talk.
Can you?
No.
I know  You did it again.
You're a talking dog.
And you're a raving maniac.
I suppose you think that's funny.
Trying ventriloquism on a defenseless dog.
Oh, no, you are wrong.
Your dog did talk.
I ought to report you to the Humane Society.
Yeah.
Oh, well.
I will do better next time.
Oh.
I will get it.
No, no, Milton.
For that kind of a job, we need help.
Girard, all of our contacts are either occupied or they are up the river.
We cannot find help.
Someone is asking for help.
Oh, I would be most happy to help you.
Beat it, sister.
You do not want my help?
Now, why would you wanna help us?
Because all of your friends are up the river.
Let's get rid of her, Milton.
Just a moment, Girard.
Do you happen to own a car, angel pie?
N-no.
But I-I can get one.
Girard, our prayers have been answered.
If you can get that little car and meet us at the corner of 12th and Main say, about an hour, you will restore our faith in humankind.
Oh, thank you, sir.
And the cube root of 20,600 is Twenty-seven-point- forty-one.
Twenty-seven-point f Where have you been?
In the park.
Did you miss me, master?
Well, I was worried about you, if that's what you mean.
You must not worry about me, master.
You have work to do.
Yeah.
Yeah, hello.
I met two of the nicest men.
Uh, y-yes, Dr. Bellows.
Well, it's It's coming along fine.
Uh, I-it I've been at it since you've left.
They need a car.
Yeah.
Well, right now, sir, it's impossible to say.
Yeah, I've just made a dent in it.
I think maybe they want to take me for a ride.
May I borrow yours?
Huh?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Well, uh, I-I'm into the second section, sir.
Right.
Ha.
Well, there's not much I can do about it until I get the f Uh.
Uh, be careful.
No.
No.
Not Not you, sir.
No.
It's just a friend of mine borrowing my car.
Yeah.
Borrowing my car?
She can't even drive a magic carpet.
Wait a minute!
Hey!
Magic carpet?
But I do not understand.
If the money is yours, why do you not take it out of the bank?
My father, Mr. Walsingham, happens to be the president of that very bank where I want you to make the withdrawal.
Will he not give you the money?
No.
And you know why not?
Because I wanna donate it to the Transylvanian Orphans Society.
His father wouldn't give them orphans a dime.
Nah.
Oh, that is terrible.
I will be honored to help you.
I knew you would.
But how do I get the money?
Oh.
Just hand this note to the teller.
When he reads that, he'll give you everything he's got.
Oh, how lovely.
Ha.
I will be right back.
Milton?
Huh?
Drive me to the police station.
I wanna give myself up.
Oh, what are you talking about?
It's perfect.
Milton.
Any dame who's stupid enough to believe that story, has got to land us in the clink.
Come on, let's go.
Excuse me.
Uh, can you tell me where may I buy some money?
Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
May I help you?
Oh, yes, please.

Why, ma'am, what on earth for?
Because you tricked me.
Thank you.
Now, I'm going to take this money back to the bank.
To the bank?
Of course.
That's where it came from.
Oh, but ma'am, the bank is closed.
Oh, that does not matter.
I can get in.
You can?
And now, we are Uh, we are I am going to take you to the police.
Mm-hm.
No, Girard.
Are you ready?
The lady is right.
Holy smokes.
She's contagious.
We have committed a crime, Girard.
We must pay our debt to society.
Dear lady are you sure you can get inside that bank?
Well, of course.
Dear lady.
Dear sweet lady.
I have only one regret.
That I cannot put that money back into the bank with my own hands.
Then I wouldn't have this terrible burden of guilt.
Do you really mean that?
I swear it on my little wife's hand.
But you're not mar  All right.
We will We will go to the bank first, and then go to the police.
I will never forget this.
Neither will I. The car still outside, lady?
No, but I can get it.
Well, then, dear lady, you just get it, and meet us at the bank in half an hour.
Very well.
Oh.
My master is going to be so pleased.
Her master's gonna be so pleased?
You should've let me bop her.
Dumbbell.
The papers don't know anything about us.
They only know about that lady.
If we can get inside that bank, we can wipe it out.
Uhh.
That's mine!
No, sir.
No, sir.
You must have misunderstood me.
No.
I I didn't say magic carpet.
No, no.
I don't think s  Master, we are going to put the bank money back in the bank.
Yeah, uh Oh, boy, are you in trouble.
Uh No, uh I'm waiting for that material from the lab, sir.

Just a moment.
We are going to need your car again.
Would you just be quiet?
No, not you, sir.
No, I was just, uh Yeah.

That's the car.
Where is she?
I tell you, she's setting us up, Milton.
I don't like it.
It's a trap.
You may be right.
Let's decamp.
Yoo-hoo!
I am over here.
Shh!
Silence, my little pumpkin.
We don't wanna wake up the children.
They might be sleeping.
Oh.
Of course.
You brought the money.
I knew you would.
Well, we gave a solemn oath, lady.
Well, shall we go in?
But what about the alarm system?
Oh, do not worry about that.
I have taken care of everything.
Milton.
Let's offer her a partnership.
Inspector, that's ridiculous.
He swore that he wasn't involved.
His car is at the bank?
At 2 a.m.?
Well, he's undoubtedly just making a deposit.
A night deposit.
I'll be right down.
Oh.
I wish she wouldn't do these things.
Master?
What is it?
What are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
Oh, we are putting the money back in the vault.
We?
You mean you opened the vault for those guys?
Well, of course, master.
You told me, "Bank money to the bank".
I know what I told you.
Just don't do anything anymore, would you, please?
Yes, master.
Turn on the lights, will you?
But you told me not to do anything I know.
Just turn on the lights.
Yes, master.
Girard.
Somebody turned on the lights.
Huh?
Girard!
Huh?
Oh, good.
Now I can see.
Would you mind investigating it?
What?
Investigate.
Oh, sure.
Jeannie, these guys are dangerous.
If they are dangerous, you had better let me help you.
No.
I'm well-trained in unarmed combat.
Now, you go over there and sit down.
Oh, but master Go on, go on.
Very well, master.
Go on.
All right, you guys, come on out of there.
Uh, hi.
Uh  Now, uh, I think we can talk this over, fellas.
Girard.
A-all right, that's enough of that.
I'm not kidding you.
Master?
Yes?
What is it?
What is this?
What?
I'm not helping.
What is this?
What is it?
I   Now take it easy, will you?
Aah!
What is this?
What kind of help?
Oh, master, you're doing beautifully.
You are sure you would not like me to help you, master?
No, Jeannie.
I wanna do it myself.
Oh.
Oof!
Now wait a Wait a minute.
I'm gonna open you up like a can of sardines.
Oh, no.
No, wait Whoa!
What is?
Major Major Nelson.
What is this all about?
Well, I, uh  You'll find that Major Nelson has an explanation for almost everything.
Uh, you can explain it, can't you?
Well Uh.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to tell you the truth, sir.
I know what you're going to tell me.
When you learned that your car had been used for the bank robbery, you tracked down the bank robbers and captured them single-handedly.
Right, major?
I couldn't have explained it better myself, sir.
Get these people out of here.
Oh, yeah.
All right, major.
I really don't understand you, Major Nelson.
In fact, I never have.
We've been through some baffling experiences before, but this This is incredible.
Would you mind telling me what you're doing in armor?
Never mind.
All I can say is that I've never been so relieved in my life.
Thank you.
Congratula I  Oh.
He's done it to me again.

And I am the old genie that the new genie is going to spend the day with.
Well, what's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that?
What if she is younger and more beautiful than I am after I have spent the best years of my life with my master?
Younger and more beautiful?
What if she falls in love with me?
Oh, just think, my own personal young and beautiful genie.
Yeah What is that?
What is that, huh?
She is coming.
Beginners always try to make a grand entrance.
Oh?
Well, you tell her to go right back where she came from.
I'm not gonna have her in this house.
I cannot.
Oh, yes, you can.
They did not tell me it would be a man.

Yes, master.
Oh, I don't mean that.
I mean, make it disappear.
Oh, I cannot, master.
Why not?
Oh, Haji would not permit it.
I-I'm sure he would rather Harold do it himself.
Well, Haji's house is not on fire.
I am your master, and I'm ordering you to do it.
Would you do it, please?
He will be angry.
Well, let him.
I don't care.
Let him be angry.
Oh, I wish Dad would relax.
Can you get rid of him, huh?
I must apologize.

You will act properly surprised, won't you?
Oh, certainly, sir.
Uh, about what?
Well, I don't have to tell you that your orbital flight the other day was a spectacular success.
Oh, I'm very pleased it came off so well, sir.
Weren't you a little disappointed that the president didn't call?
Well, I guess these things are getting to be kind of routine now.
Well, you guessed wrong, major.
The president is going to do something that he's never done before.
He's going up into orbit?
He wants to congratulate you in person.
Oh, you mean I'll be going to Washington?
No, the president is coming down here.
Really?

George Washington.

I wonder if we could continue this some other time.
I have a touch of space fatigue.
Master.
Master.

Did they just call you master?
Yeah, it's a little nickname they have for me here at NASA.
Yes, I understand, major, but May I have one more take before you leave?

I I You do understand.
Could we do it another time?
All right, here we go.
Watch the birdie.

I'm sure they won't, sir.
I can't understand what happened.
The photographer Uh, sir, would you tell us more about the president coming?
Oh, uh, yes.

You know, something without a lot of ceremony.
So he's coming to your house for dinner.
The president's coming to my house for dinner?
A Mr. Pinter, from the White House, will go to your house with you and go over everything.
As a matter of fact, he's waiting for you right now at General Walton's office.
Uh, now?
Right now?
Yes, that's the big surprise.
The president is having dinner at your house tonight.
Tonight?
But he Tonight?
But he can't do that tonight.
Yes.
Well, I must say, I didn't expect you to be that nervous.
Well, I'm sorry.

The president will have to come tomorrow.
All there is to it.

No, I'll take care of it.
I think it'd be better No, no, no, I will take care of it!
I will take care of it!
Somebody take care of it.
There's a fine, little French restaurant down the street.
I'm sure the president would enjoy that, sir.
There's nothing to worry about.
We'll put security guards at both ends of the street.
Well, what's not really the problem, you see.
I wanna do it!
I wanna do it!
It's my job!
It's my job!
I want to do I!
We'd better let him have a go at it.
I want All right.
But now, concentrate, Harold.
That sounds like it's coming from the inside of your house, major.
Uh, what sounds like it's coming from the inside of my house?
That music.
Oh, yes.
Well, I often keep the radio on to frighten burglars away.
Uh, why don't you open the door, major?
I'm afraid Of burglars?
Yes.
Oh, yes.
Um, I Uh, sometimes I bring home classified material, and I Oh, nonsense, major.
Open the door.
Op I bring some papers home, you know Open the door, major.
Yes, sir.
Hey, what is that?
Uh, oh, you found it.
Well, that's Major.
Yes?
What are we waiting for?
A miracle.
Well, how would you like to see the grounds?
I've done quite a bit of gardening recently.
I've been experimenting with begonia.
Uh, the grafting of begonias I certainly hope the president likes a man with a sense of humor, right, Mr. Pinter?
Dr. Bellows.
Major.
Yes?
Oh.
Yes, of course.
Uh, I'll just, uh Concentrate, Harold.
Harold, try harder.
You can do it.
Come on.
Try.
What was that?
Uh, probably a rock 'n' roll station.
How would the president feel about a Mexican meal?
There's a wonderful little restaurant about And how would the major feel about going inside, if you don't mind?
Yes, sir.
Just the key.
I'll get that.
I'm terribly sorry.
All right.
I'll look over here.
Try again, Harold.
Yeah, Harold.
Okay.
Good.
Not bad, huh?
And now for the belly dancer.
Yeah, for the belly dancer.
Wait!
Whoa!
Not yet.
What am I saying?
Go ahead.
Okay.
Oh, good.
Good, good.
Now get rid of yourself.
I'm not leaving.
Oh, we will hide.
How would that be, Harold?
Yeah, yeah, hide.
Good idea.
In the closet.
I don't wanna hide.
I wanna see my master.
I mean you shouldn't, heh.
Jeannie, think of something.
I have, heh.
We will stay here, Harold, but we will disguise ourselves.
How would that be?
Oh, goody-goody.
Major, may we please go in?
Well, I'm looking for the key, sir.
I I You just had the door open.
Well, it was here somewhere.
I I know it's around here.
Oh, just a minute, sir.
Hello, Major Healey.
Oh, Mr. Pinter, this is, uh, Major Healey.
What's that noise?
Uh, oh, uh, uh, well, that's the cleaning crew, sir.
You know, the, uh, cleaning crew?
I hired a couple to clean the house.
Wasn't that a good idea, Tony?
Oh, yeah.
Well, everything looks fine.
Uh, everything looks like it's about done.
We haven't finished yet.
Yes, you have.
Daddy wouldn't like that.
His father says he should always finish anything he starts.
His father really doesn't have anything to do with it, does he?
I think he does.
Here, I'll clean that.
No, I'll clean it.
I'll clean it.
No, I'll do it.
Gentlemen, we haven't too much time.
May we proceed, please?
Of course, Mr. Pinter.
Now, as a general rule, the White House prefers to waive as much protocol as possible in affairs of this nature.
I would say a general feeling of informality should prevail.
Uh, what would the president prefer for dinner?
Rack of lamb.
President's gonna have dinner here?
That's right, Harold.
Goodbye.
Goodbye?
I'm gonna cook dinner for him.
My first day on the job.
Won't my father would be proud?
No I thought he was the cleaning man.
He's a jack-of-all-trades.
Hey!
Harold?
Oh, well, I never What?
Don't worry.
I'll fix it.
Please, don't worry.
I'm terribly sorry about this.
They're new on the job.
Well, I should think you might be.
Look at this!
I, uh There you are.
Good as new.
Harold, perhaps we should go clean the kitchen.
Yeah, right.
I apologize, Mr. Pinter.
Where did you find that cleaning man?
Where did you find that cleaning man?
Where?
Where?
Where?
Where'd we get the cleaning man?
Well, maybe you'd like to go back and change your clothes at your hotel.
I'd rather get this over with as soon as possible.
Now, the president will enter first.
He will be followed by General Walton.
There's a very nice rack-of-lamb house right on the edge of town.
President's probably tired of eating home-cooked The president was very specific.
He will dine here tonight.
Now, may I inspect the kitchen?
Tell me the truth.
Do you think I made a good impression?
Harold, why do you not try another line of work?
This was my dad's idea.
I wanted to be a chariot driver.
Harold, do not stir the salad.
Toss it.
Uh, sir, uh, there's no really Reason to go Roger, where did you get those people anyway, huh?
I don't understand why you should ever The president prefers Roquefort.
I'm terribly sorry about the  I Uh, sir, please, uh Can't I even mash the potatoes?
Now, remember our deal.
You will not do anything all evening, and I will have a chariot race with you tomorrow.
I can't wait.
The last race I had was with Ben-Hur.
Who won?
It's not who won.
It's how you play the game.
Hi, uh, h?
How's everything coming, huh?
Oh, wonderfully, master.
There, the potatoes are finished.
The dessert is made.
I will now just finish the garlic bread.
And I will put the lamb in just before the president arrives.
Zachary Taylor.
What about him?
Oh, you will not have to worry about Harold.
Oh, all right.
Now, I'm gonna go and take a shower and change clothes, huh?
I wish I could stay and watch.
Watch your tongue.
Yes, master.
It was just an expression.
Just think, the president here for dinner.
Even your father will be impressed by that.
Except I have nothing to do with it.
I mean, you're supposed to be training me.
I tell you what, you can get the lamb out of the freezer.
Big deal.
Where is it?
It is right here on top.
I will go set the table.
It's not here.
Jeannie!
It She must have left it at the market.
Jeannie!
What do I need her for?
Dad will be real proud of me.
Yeah, lamb.
Master!
Huh?
Harold, do something.
Oh, I did.
I'm afraid to do any more.
I'll get 'em out one by one.

The president of the United States is right outside my door.
You know that?
Master, does he like sheep?
Would you please get rid of these?
I cannot.
Harold did it.
Well, Harold, would you get rid of 'em?
If the president liked fish, this never would have happened.
Master, master, they are gone.
Huh?
Oh.

Frankly, I couldn't have been more surprised.
Well, I'm glad you had a good time, sir.
"Good" doesn't describe it.
Good night, major.
Oh, boy.
It was a lovely party, master.
You were here?
Oh, yes.
And I saw everything, and you were wonderful.
You should be the president.
I was great Har?

Sometimes they get up to a hundred miles an hour.
Cut right through you.
Hundred miles an hour?
Yeah, things get so cold, your ears drop off sometimes.
Brr.
Ears drop off?
Master would you mind very much if I did not go with you?
Oh, well, I I kind of looked forward to you coming along, Jeannie.
I I am very fond of my ears.

Let's go to work.
We don't have to report until tomorrow.

Is that something, huh?
Do you realize how high up we were?
Well, here's the beach.
There's the girls.
You look at that.
Do you see that?

Oh!

The palace is a monument to the era of Hawaiian monarchy".
How about that?
Roger, what are you doing?
Are you gonna eat that thing or are you gonna beat it to death?
I'm trying to get it open.
I wonder how many Hawaiians starved to death waiting for their breakfast.
Well, it says in this book that King Kamehameha could open a coconut with just two fingers.
Two fingers?
Oh, you can't believe everything you read.
He must have been a very powerful man.
Oh, yeah.
He was a great man.
"Kamehameha Nui was the most" I thought we were talking about King Kamehameha.
Oh, yeah.
Well, uh, Nui means "the great" in Hawaiian.
It says here, "Over 200 years ago, "he defended these islands against the invaders and drove them over the Pali".
I sure would have liked to have met him.
I did say I wish I could have met him, didn't I?
Yes, master.
You did say that.
Yeah.
Kamehameha.
Kamehameha Nui.
Ah.
Hello, sir.
Uh I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to meet you.
Yes, well.

Can you really break open a coconut?
Just put it away.
Can you imagine what a thrill this is gonna be for him?
But if he could break this open Just Just forget it, will you?
He has a chance to see what civilization has done for his country.
Oh!

This man steal royal whale teeth.
Pineapple no can eat.

Takes three to make rain dance.
Come!
Well, it takes two to tango.
Come!
What are we gonna do?
We're gonna do a little rain dance.
I've never done the rain dance before.
I've never done any kind of dance before.
Humor him.
Right when he's starting to dance.
Ah.
The gods approve.
It worked.
It worked.
Ah.
Oh, Major Healey Oh.
Major Nelson.
Us.
Oh.
Come here.
Yes, sir.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Oh.
Would you mind telling me what you were doing in that fountain?
Oh, just your average Hawaiian rain dance, sir.
Did you say you were doing a rain dance?
Uh, yes, sir.
One of our Hawaiian friends was teaching us some of the chants of the island.
Once it's raining, there's no sense hanging around.
Very good seeing you, sir.
Come on, Roge.
They made it rain?
I did it!
I did it!
I made it rain!
I made it rain?
I don't know.
He's not out in front.
He's not out back either.
Oh, I never thought I'd be playing nursemaid to a king.
Boy, think of all those beautiful girls on the beach.
Roger, will you forget about the beautiful girls.
We got important things to do Forget the beautiful girls on the beach?
Why did you have to send for him?
I didn't send for him.
Jeannie Now, don't start Why don't we call the police, and they'll send out an alarm When they find him, you can explain who he is.
You do it.
All right, okay.
I wish he didn't have such a terrible temper.
Roger, that's why we're trying to find him.
Really.
That's why we're trying Oh.
I've been looking everywhere for you.
It worked.
It worked.
What worked, sir?
Your rain dance.
Why, it's the most amazing thing that ever happened to me.

Why?
Where is he?
Where can we find him?
Whe-where's who, sir?
That native fellow you were dancing with.
The rainmaker.
Don't you realize if he went to Washington with us, have you any idea what it would mean?
It would certainly shake up the boys in meteorology.
Well, I think so.
Predicting the weather is one thing, but making the weather?
Why, we're just beginning to experiment.
Of course, you'd have to do it with a straight face.
A straight face?
Especially when they point out to you that here in the tropics, it can be sun shining one minute and pouring down rain the next.
Could it have been a coincidence?
It's a great practical joke, sir.
I can see the expression on the scientist's face, and the generals are standing around watching this guy  I didn't know the general had that sense of humor.
Ah.
He hasn't.
And this is gonna be a very expensive joke.
Flying this guy to Washington.
Oh.
Much too expensive.
I I don't know what I could have been thinking of.
I Oh, gentlemen, will you, uh, please do me a favor?
Uh, forget Forget I ever mentioned it.
Please.

No, but I've certainly heard a lot about it.
You just stick your finger right in like this.
Oh.
Mm!
How is it, Roge?
Mm-mm.
Oh, the entertainment's starting.
Did you arrange for this, doctor?
Uh, no, general.
Uh, did you, Major Nelson?
You may not believe it, but I think they're attacking.
Wait a minute.
There's Gail.
There's Carla.
Carla!
Oh, there is Tommy.
And Billy.
Come on.
The luau looks good.
Dave.
Oh.
Hi, Yvonne.
What are you boys doing with those spears?
It's kind of hard to explain.
Come, we have extra food at the luau.
Why don't you come and join us?
Gee, I don't know.
Come on.
Look.
That's what the other boys are doing.
Why not?
This is a marvelous idea, major.
It almost looked real.
Yes, didn't it?
Where did you get the hula girls?
What hula girls, sir?
Look.
I wish you wouldn't go back yet, sir.
I'd I'd like another chance to show you.
You should not have brought me here.
My people have forgotten me.
Forgotten you?
Oh, but that is not true.
Everything I have tried to do for them was written on the wind.
Oh, you are wrong.
I will show you.
Wait.
What are you gonna do?
Master, do you not know what day this is?
This is King Kamehameha Day.
I thought today was Monday.
Every year on June 11th, your people honor your memory.
I do not believe this.
Oh, I will show you.
Not here.
Well Wha?
Very good.
Wha?
Look, Your Majesty.
This?
To honor me?
Oh, yes, Your Majesty.
Ah.
I am not displeased.
My people have not forgotten me.
I not understand your way of life but my people seem happy.
Perhaps this progress is good for them.
Oh, I am sure it is, Your Majesty.
I am ready to return now.
Well, it's certainly been a pleasure meeting you, sir.
Well, uh, maybe next time you can show me that coconut trick.
You make sure your civilization take care of my people.
I know, I will.
Uh, you You can count on that, sir.
I am ready.
Oh, boy.
There goes one of the nicest kings I ever met.
I wonder what King Tut was like?
Would you like to meet him, general?
Well Just watch the parade, huh?
I'll go too.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Well, this time tomorrow, you and Major Healey will be strolling down the Via Veneto at Rome.
Hm, yes, sir.
I'm looking forward to it.
I want you and Major Healey to remember that this vacation is strictly for R and R. Rest and relaxation.
I, uh, don't want you to be lonely over there.
This is a letter of introduction.
Oh.
Thank you very much, sir.
It's to my aunt.
She's lived in Italy for 50 years.
Oh.
Uh, she's a lot of fun.
Oh.
Good, good, good.
Thanks very much.
I'll I'll see you in two weeks.
Fine.
Bon voyage.
I can't believe it.
Two whole weeks without Major Nelson.
Hm.
Ha-ha.
"Caution, do not close".
I see.
Master, darling.
Oh.
Hi, Jeannie.
Hm.
I am ready.
What are you doing?
I told you to stay home and wait for me.
Oh, I could not wait, master.
I am so excited.
Two whole weeks in Rome.
Ho-ho.
I can hardly wait to see Michelangelo again.
Yeah.
But if anybody discovers you're here, both you and I, we're gonna have to move in with Michelangelo.
Now, you go home and And start packing.
Oh.
We are all packed.
We For two weeks in Rome, you're packed in that?
Well, you said you wanted to travel light.
So I shrunk everything.
It's kind of cute.
Somebody's coming.
Someone's coming.
Go on, go on.
Get out.
Oh!
How is this?
Huh?
Where are you?
Down here in the big box.
Huh?
And here.
Take that.
No, I don't mean in there.
I mean, go home.
Ahh!
Oh, I'm sorry, Tony.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Hey, is this the baby they're sending up to the moon?
Yes.
Well, what are you doing?
What's up?
It's locked.
What do you mean it's locked?
It's locked!
What's wrong?
Jeannie's in there.
Jeannie's in there?
Well, why would they want to send Jeannie to the moon?
Jeannie's in there?
Master?
Master?
!
Please let me out of here.
I do not want to go to the moon.
Let me out of here!
Don't worry, Jeannie.
Tony went to get the combination.
We'll have you out of there in a minute.
Please!
I am not ready to go to the moon.
Dr. Bellows.
Oh, major.
I thought you'd be halfway to Rome by now.
I was just on my way, sir.
Oh, by the way, I was wondering if you could give me the combination to the moon safe.
Very funny.
I'll see you in two weeks.
Ah, but could you give me the combination, sir?
Major, I'm very busy at the moment.
Why do you want it?
Oh.
It's nothing to worry about.
It's just that I accidentally shut the door.
You what?
!
Yeah.
And it And it locked.
But it's nothing to worry about.
Can you give me the combination?
Nobody knows the combination!
Nobody knows the combination?
Get me General Sullivan.
Sir, what good is a safe if nobody knows the combination?
Uh, General Sullivan.
Uh Uh, Dr. Bellows here.
Well, I'm sorry, sir, but, um the, uh, safe-closing ceremony will have to be cancelled.
It was accidentally locked.
Well, I'm sorry, sir Yes, I know it's regrettable, but she'll have to go up there just as she is.
Well, she can't go up there, sir.
Not all alone.
Uh, yes, general.
I'll make the necessary calls.
Uh, d-doctor.
We've gotta open that safe, sir.
It's too late, major.
Too late?
Mm.
Open the blinds.
What?
The blinds.
Oh?
See that rocket?
Oh, yeah.
Project Cold Storage.
Tomorrow morning at sunrise that rocket is blasting off for the moon with the safe and other D-did you say with the safe, sir?
With the safe and other assorted instruments aboard.
Oh, uh, bu But, Dr. Bellows, I-is it really almost?
Hello.
Dr. Bellows here.
Oh, uh Will you put it on hold, please?
Dr. Bellows, it's very important.
The payload will be dumped to test the reaction to the lunar environment.
But, sir, I-it's very important The safe contains things that an astronaut will need to sustain life.
So if you want the combination to that safe, it's really very simple.
All you have to do is be the first man on the moon.
Hi.
Did you get the combination?
No, Dr. Bellows doesn't have it.
What do you mean he doesn't have it?
He just doesn't have it.
Uh Uh, Jeannie, you're gonna have to get out by yourself.
Oh.
It is no use, master.
If you cannot open this safe, it is impossible.
I I am trapped.
It is just like putting the cork in my bottle.
That's a combination lock.
This shouldn't be hard to open.
By the time we figure out the combination, this safe is gonna be on its way to the moon.
Uh, J-Jeannie.
I-I want you to turn yourself to smoke.
Try getting out that way.
Oh.
Very well.
But I do not think it will work.
Uh, Jeannie, are you all right?
Yes.
But I am still here.
I think we're in trouble.
There we are.
Yeah.
Give me the bag.
Yeah.
Sledgehammer.
Sledgehammer.
Oh Chisel.
Chisel, chisel.
Monkey wrench.
Monkey wrench.
And a crowbar.
That ought to do it.
I don't know, Tony, that thing looked strong.
If that doesn't work, we get a blowtorch.
If that doesn't work Yeah?
We're in trouble.
I bet Dr. Bellows would give us the combination if he knew how important this was.
Yeah, how do we tell him?
Well, we could walk up to him and tell him that we'd like to get inside the safe because there's a genie in there.
I I wonder w-where we can get a blowtorch this time of night.
Give me that.
Shh!
Jeannie, are you there?
Yes, master.
L-look, don't Don't worry about a thing.
In a few minutes, we're gonna be having dinner at the Cocoa Beach Yacht Club.
Hurry, master.
When you hear some hammering, don't be frightened.
It's just us trying to break in.
Oh, I will not be frightened.
I have faith in you.
Hey, wait a minute, Roger.
Maybe this pamphlet has some construction details that will tell us the easiest way to get in.
Here.
It says the, uh "The moon safe is completely resistant to extremes of temperature and pressure".
Yeah.
"A " "A unique" "A unique feature of the moon safe is the explosive device built into the walls".
You hear that?
Yeah.
"Should anyone dial incorrect numbers or attempt to break in, the explosive will be detonated, destroying the safe and the contents".
Here goes.
No!
Watch it.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
You would have blown up the safe with Jeannie in it.
What do you mean?
What is happening, master?
When are you going to start hammering?
Uh, we're not gonna be able to break in, Jeannie.
The The safe will explode.
What are you going to do?
Then how will you get me out of here?
That's a good question.
We're gonna have to get professional advice.
Yeah, professional advice.
Hey, why don't we get a locksmith?
We'll get a locksmith.
A locksmith.
No, no, a locksmith would ask too many questions.
Too many questions.
Uh A professional safecracker, that's what we need.
Yeah, a safecracker.
Yeah.
Where are we gonna get a safecracker?
Um I I read about the police raiding a bar and grill that a lot of mobsters hang out at.
Uh The Pink Horse?
The Pink Horse Bar and Grill.
Yeah.
That's where we're gonna get him.
Uh, Jeannie.
Jeannie, now Now, don't worry about a thing.
You just make yourself comfortable.
Uh, Roger and I are gonna go and get you a A professional safecracker.
Oh, be careful, master.
Safecrackers are dangerous criminals.
Hey, she's right.
The Pink Horse Bar and Grill.
That's where all the gangsters hang out.
Where do you expect to find a safecracker, the yellow pages?
Come on.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Give a hand.
Give a hand, Where's?
Shh!
Shh!
Well, here it is.
Is that you, master?
Did you say something, Joe?
Not me.
Come on.
Give me a hand with this.
You know, I could've sworn somebody said, "Is that you, master"?
Sure you did, Mike.
It's probably a little green moon man in the safe going home.
Okay.
It's good enough here.
All right.
Easy.
Easy.
There we are.
Oh.
Easy now.
Do you know what's kind of crazy?
Mm-hm.
We can't cure a common cold.
But tomorrow morning this thing's gonna be on its way to the moon.
What'll it be, gents?
Two beers heavy on the foam.
Right.
We want a little information.
Look.
Why don't you guys just go on to your costume party?
You could get hurt in here.
Listen.
Have you ever heard of the Atlantic City bank robbery?
I ain't even heard of Atlantic City.
I guess you didn't hear about the robbery then, huh?
Mm.
Good foam.
We're down from Chicago to do a job.
Do you have a can opener?
A can opener?
You know what we mean.
Yeah.
And we're willing to pay for it.
Oh.
Two bucks.
Hey.
Hey.
Hey!
What's your bag, man?
My bag?
Bag.
Oh.
Um Well, uh, we're looking for What are you?
Fuzz?
Fuzz?
Fuzz.

Get a club.
Look busy.

I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Listen I give you a hundred dollars if you help me.
Try to look busy, try to look busy.
Not bad for $2, huh?
What?
Give me that.
Try to look busy, will you?
Yeah, look busy.
Yeah.
Look busy.
Professor, I'd like for you to meet Please.
No names.
It's a pleasure to meet you, professor.
Please.
No handshakes.
Charley, get me a stick.
A what?
Charley!
Here, professor.
Gentlemen.
Keep playing, keep playing, keep playing.
What can I do for you?
Are you a safecracker?
Professor's the best in the business.
Charley here is one of my most ardent admirers.
You say it to anybody, don't you, Charley?
You'd even say it to the FBI.
Wouldn't you, Charley?
Professor, they ain't no FBI.
They ain't no FBI.
Don't you think I can see that?
Professor  We've got a job for you tonight.
Keep playing, keep playing.
What kind of a job?
It's It's a safe.
Obviously.
What's in the safe?
Well, it's a A jewel.
A rare jewel.
It's the only one of its kind in the world.
I'll say.
Where is this jewel?
NASA.
The space agency?
!
Shh!
The safe is guaranteed unopenable.
We have to do the job tonight because the safe is gonna be moved tomorrow morning.
P-p-professor, we can't pull a A job at NASA.
I mean, like Fort Knox, the place is guarded.
Charley, Charley, Charley.
Major Nelson and Major Healey both work for NASA.
I'm sure they'll arrange to find some way to get us in.
How did you know our names?
I'm also a pickpocket.
Well, I'll be It's my watch.
Somebody's moved it.
It was right here.
Somebody's moved it.
Hey, what are you guys trying to pull?
You don't think they loaded it already?
No, of course not.
Here, look in the back.
Take that.
Professor, I told you, we shouldn't get mixed up with amateurs.
Relax, Charley.
They have got more to lose than we have.
I know where it is.
It's at the final assembly room.
It's on the tarmac.
Roger.
Come on.
Let's hurry.
I dropped the flashlight.
I'll get the flashlight.
You take 'em to the final assembly room.
Get the flashlight.
Sh!
Where's that flashlight?
Dr. Bellows.
Did you lose this flashlight?
Oh.
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
I'm sure you have a reasonable explanation why you were crawling on the floor here instead of being in Rome on your vacation?
Where you belong.
Yes.
Yes, I do.
You don't have to tell me.
I don't?
No.
I'll tell you.
You will?
Mm.
You couldn't bear to go away and, um, not see the launching of the moonshot.
Yeah Well, the truth is, sir Uh, the truth is, I should have guessed it.
Uh, do you know your trouble, Major Nelson?
What's that, sir?
You're overconscientious.
Me?
But it's not going to go unrewarded.
Ahem.
Oh, well, that's very kind of you, sir.
You're gonna watch that launching from the control room.
I'm gonna watch it, sir?
Oh I insist.
I insist.
I I have a plane You're going to sit right next to me.
Yeah, but, sir Ah, yes.
No, no, no, no, no.
And after the launching, I'm gonna put you on the plane Sir, it's very important that I go Come along.
Wait, sir.
Master?
Where am I?
In the final assembly room, dum-dum.
Oh.
Thank you.
Joe.
I'm hearing it again.
Hearing what?
Voices.
Didn't you hear it?
You mean the one that just said, "Where am I"?
and then, "Thank you"?
Mm-mm.
I didn't hear a thing.
Right.
Neither did I. Oh.
What do you think it was?
Probably some new secret weapon.
Boy, are those Russians gonna be in for a surprise.
That's it.
Let's go.
Now, wait a second, wait a second.
You don't expect us to work on that thing out in the open, do you?
Oh, we have to.
In a few minutes that thing's gonna be shot to the moon.
Look, you stay here.
I'll go and see if the coast is clear.
Professor, I don't like it.
Look.
Even if we're able to get the jewel out of that safe I mean, if it is one of a kind we'll never be able to push it.
Very shrewd, Charley.
But you missed the crucial question.
Why would NASA want to shoot a rare precious stone to the moon?
Yeah, that's right.
It's a phony.
So what are we standing here for?
Why?
Because whatever is in that safe Major Nelson and Major Healey are desperate to get it out.
And people don't get desperate over something of no value.
Ah.
That's why.
Jeannie.
Can you hear me?
It's me, Roge.
Yes, Major Healey.
Two men moved me last night.
Where am I?
The final assembly room.
Ready to be loaded on the moon rocket.
Do not worry.
Well, uh Uh, where is Major Nelson?
I don't know.
Will he be on the rocket?
No, just you and a bunch of equipment.
Well, then, I-I would like to get out, please.
Don't worry, Jeannie.
We got some experts working on it now.
MAN : Three-forty mark.
Usually we don't use  Uh, status check?
That is, Major Healey and Major Nelson  What's the matter with this thing any?
What are they loading now?
Let's see.
Number 12 meteorological survey monitor.
Uh, what number is that moon safe?
Seventeen.
I just remembered.
I gotta see somebody.
If you'll excuse me.
Aren't you waiting?
Of course he is.
Oh.
Dr. Bellows, I Major Nelson put off his vacation to watch this launching.
Uh, that's the kind of loyalty we get from our astronauts, congressman.
Well, that's very commendable, major.
Very commendable.
Tell me, son, how will you feel when you see that rocket lifting off its launch pad?
I'd rather not try to describe my feelings, sir.
What are you doing, professor?
I'm getting ready to open your safe.
Don't touch  Don't touch it?
Oh.
If you dial the wrong combination, the whole safe will blow up.
Oh, let's hide.
Hide.
Oh.
What happened to the safe?
The safe?
What safe?
Y The safe, sir.
The safe?
Oh, the safe.
Oh, well, the safe was, uh It's over there.
It's way over there.
Oh.
Thank you, major.
Way over.
Way Well, it's not here.
What happened?
There it is.

This.
There's the safe.
Oh, that safe.
Yeah.
You wanted that safe, yeah.
Well, carry on, men.
Thank you, major.
Take care of that safe.
Bye.
Yeah.
Nice work.
All right, pull it up.
Get okay.
Do your best, Mike.
Charley.
I've got an idea.
You feeling all right, major?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
You know, I understand they keep you on a pretty short leash out here.
Make you watch your diets, regulate your sleep, cut down on your social life.
How do you feel about that?
Oh, it It's a wonderful program, sir.
They They keep us in tiptop shape.
You don't look too well.
Here.
Thank you.
Congressman, hm-hm if you look at the monitor there, you'll see them loading the moon safe.
You all right, major?
Yeah.
Tiptop shape.
There it is, congressman.
So that's the famous moon safe.
Well, there it goes.
They're loading it into the rocket.
Hm.
It'll be going off any minute now.
You know, it's remarkable how calm and collected you all stay.
I'm nervous as a cat.
Major Nelson!
Major Nelson.
I thought you kept these astronauts in top physical condition?
Oh, he's fine, congressman, I assure you.
Sit down, major.
Jeannie?
Jean?
I gotta get her out of there.
I gotta get her out of there!
Jeannie!
Major Nelson, where are you going?
Jeannie!
Major!
Come back here, major!
Stop them.
Gotta stop them.
Minus 10, nine, eight, seven, six  That's Nelson!
Five, four  Stop the launch!
Stop it!
Stop that launch!
Stop!
Goodbye, Jeannie.
Goodbye.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
MAN : Three, two, one, zero.
There's gotta be some way of stopping that thing.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Beautiful.
Just beautiful.
Oh.
Roger, Jeannie's locked in the moon safe.
She She's on her way to the moon.
Every time I see one of those things, I get a lump in my throat.
She was counting on us, Roger, and we let her down.
Look at that thing move.
Don't you understand?
!
Jeannie's gone.
Uh, no, she No, she isn't.
What a perfect blastoff.
We let her down, Roger.
She's gonna be up there all alone.
She's gonna be helpless.
She What'd you say?
You know the moon safe Jeannie was locked in?
Yeah?
Well, it wasn't loaded in the rocket.
What are you talking about?
I saw it on the tar They brought it out.
No, something else.
No, no.
Jeannie's right here in the safe, right here.
I made a switch.
You're kidding!
You did?
!
Really?
Where is she?
She's in the final assembly room.
What's gotten into you?
Come on!
Ah, what a beautiful, beautiful Come on!
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Roge Just relax.
I know exactly where it is.
Look, there's no prob Oh.
What are you doing over there?
Tony, relax.
I told you there's no problem.
I left it right over here and Oh.
Oh, wait a minute.
Oh, it was right here.
The Professor and Charley were trying to get it open.
The Professor and Charley?
You left Jeannie with them?
They're safecrackers.
They're professional criminals.
But they're working for us.
Why would they wanna steal it?
Those dirty crooks.
That's what crooks do.
They steal things.
Ah.
Wait till they open it up and find Jeannie inside.
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Whoo.
Not what I'm worried about.
What do you mean?
Well, if they try to force that safe open or even get the combination wrong, it'll explode.
What are we gonna do?
Come on.
What do you think, Professor?
I think I got it figured out.
What do you mean, you think?
Come on, try it.
You You heard what the major said.
We turn the numbers to the right combination, we get what's in the safe.
Right.
We turn the numbers to the wrong combination, and we get blown up.
I would give anything to know what's in there.
Some technical thing that ain't worth a nickel.
No, I have a feeling that whatever's in there is priceless.
But what good is it gonna do us if it's in the safe and we can't get it open?
What good is it going to do us if it blows us to pieces?
One wrong number and "pa-chow"!
You mean you believe that, uh "Pa-chow"!
I ain't been to college, Professor, but even I know a con job when I hear one.
Oh?
Come on, give me this thing.
Go ahead, you You try it.
I will.
Where you going?
I'll wait for you outside.
You wait right here.
Here.
Here goes.
One wrong number?
That's what the major said.
He was bluffing.
Pfft.
Here goes.
Did you try it yet?
What?
Did you try it yet?
No.
But I will, I will.
Hah Professor, Professor.
What's the matter?
Ticktock, ticktock.
What do you mean, ticktock?
Ticktock, ticktock.
Ticktock, ticktock?
There must be some way to find those crooks.
How about an ad in the San Quentin Journal?
Hey.
We go to the Pink Horse, that's where we met 'em.
How do we know they're there?
Because that's their hangout.
And besides, it's the only thing I could think of.
Uh, Major Nelson, Major Healey.
Yes, sir.
You both must be terribly excited about the success of the moon shot.
I haven't been able to think of anything else.
Tomorrow, we should have photos from the surface of the moon.
I can't wait to see them.
Neither can we.
If you'll excuse us, sir, we have someone to meet.
Yeah, we have this deal locked up, and it's  Uh Oh, uh, uh, Major Nelson, your phone.
Major?
Professor, we either open the safe or we don't, but this is crazy.
Please, Charley, use your imagination.
Something's valuable in that, right?
Right.
Well, the major will pay plenty for them, whether it's open or not.
Because one thing Shh.
Hello?
He's on, here.
Hello.
Hello.
Now, you listen to me.
Keep your mouth shut.
We have got your safe.
Safe?
What safe?
Who is this?
The moon safe, chum.
And if you ever expect to see it again, you'll follow instructions implicitly.
No, you listen.
This is a government installation.
Trying to start a joke around here can get you into trouble.
Look here.
This is no joke.
You do exactly what we say and follow instructions or we'll blow the safe up.
Fine, blow it up.
Excuse me I hate practical jokers.
He said, "Go ahead, blow it up".
I'm getting I don't know what this country's coming to.
I mean, the government's not willing to pay ransom for a valuable piece of property.
That's why taxes are so high.
We've got a white elephant on our hands.
We can't open the safe, and nobody else wants it.
Professor, let's get rid of it.
Guess we've got no other choice, huh?
I tell you, this is enough to make a guy turn honest, you know what I mean?
Oh.
Uh, could you help us, please?
Yes.
What'll it be, gents?
We're here on official Air Force business.
Uh, if you could give us some information.
We're looking for a couple of guys named the Professor and, uh, Charley.
Do you happen to know where they live?
Ah.
How should I know?
You don't have to register here to get a drink.
Don't I know you guys?
Withholding information from a federal agency is a crime, you know?
That's Section 102, Area Code 213 All right, Roge.
ZIP code I don't know where they live.
They just come in here every once in a while, that's all.
Shall we take him in or you think he's telling the truth?
I think he's telling the truth.
All right, we'll wait over here.
Come on, Roge.
You gonna wait till they come in?
That's right.
That's right.
Two black coffees.
They might not be in for days.
Well, make that four black coffees.
Yeah, but So?
Ten bucks.
Ten bucks?
For a valuable piece of property like this?
Wha?
Look how heavy it is.
Look.
Oh!
What am I gonna do with a safe that doesn't even open?

Yeah, paperweight.
Nothing but scrap.
Ten bucks.

"Property of NASA" stenciled on it.

About the same as the penalty for someone who is an accomplice to someone who steals government property.
Now, wait a minute.
We didn't ask you to steal it, we just asked you to open it.
Forget it, Roger.
I'll give you everything I got.

What belt?

It goes into the crusher.
The crusher?
The cru Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie?
Oh, that's a code name for the safe.
You gotta stop that belt.
Well, you can't from here.
The switch is on the crusher.
Oh, the crusher.
Jeannie!
Oh!
Oh.
Did you see it?
No, not yet.
It's gotta be here someplace.
Sorry, fellas, you're too late.
It's already gone through.
Gone through what?
Through the crusher.
Would have come out the other side.
You wanna take a look?
No.
It'll probably look, about, oh, like a sardine can.
I once put an automobile through there.
Come out, oh, Fine, sir.
Size of a cigar box.
Why, I've even seen 'em take a A What's the matter with him?
Mama!
She's gone.
I'll never see her again, Roge.
Do you remember how she used to knock on her bottle to get you to take the cork off?
And that pretty pink smoke would come out.
Yeah, and there she'd be, just smiling and happy.
Then she'd say, "How can I serve you, master"?
And you'd say, "By getting back in the bottle and staying there".
She was good, Roge.
Yeah.
I didn't deserve her.
Ah, no You were rotten.
You were rotten, all right.
You want another one?
Maybe I will have one more.
What do you know?
Hello, space agency?
No.
This is Harry's Scrap Yard.
Uh, listen, a couple of your officers were over here yesterday asking about a safe.
Just a moment please.
Dr. Bellows, it's someone about the safe again.
Will you take it, sir?
Your party's on the line, sir.
Good morning, Sue.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Thank you, I hope this coffee is good and black this morning.
I could really use it.
Good morning.
NASA.
I'm warning you, mister, if we get one more prank phone call about that safe I'll have our security police, the CIA and the FBI on your neck so fast, you won't know what hit you.
Now, you said you were gonna scrap it.
Well, scrap it!
Well, that's our government.
Yesterday, it was valuable.
Today, it's obsolete.
Come in.
Good morning, sir.
Here are the impact photos, sir.
Oh, good, let me see them.
Perfect landing.
There's only one peculiar thing.
Yeah?
What's that?
We can't find the moon safe.
What do you mean, you can't find it?
Probably buried in a dust drift.
No, sir.
It's not there.
Miss Temple, the man who called about that safe.
Did he say where he was?
Yes, sir.
Uh, Harry's Scrap Yard.
What did you say?
Harry's Scrap Yard.
Harry's Scrap Yard?
!
Shh.
Yes, sir.
This is most urgent, Miss Temple.
Find the number and call him back.
Tell him not to touch that safe until I get there.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Oh, uh, Stewart, don't let those photos out of your sight.
Yes, sir.
So, what about Harry's Scrap Yard?
I don't know, he wants me to call.
Who wants you to call them?
Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows?
Miss Temple, did you get him?
I'm looking it up.
Oh, Dr. Bellows, what about Harry's Scrap Yard?
You won't believe this, Major Healey.
You won't believe it.
But the moon safe, our moon safe, is in some place called Harry's Scrap Yard.
I gotta get there before they crush it.
Oh!
Oh, you have Oh.
Oh.
Oh Major Major Healey!
That safe is supposed to be on the moon.
I see no reason to celebrate.
Keep trying, Miss Temple.
Keep trying, Miss Temple.
Oh, wait for me, wait for me.
Colonel?
Dr. Bellows.
Help!
I can even hear her voice.
Help!
Jeannie?
Jeannie, is that you?
Master?
Well, where are you?
I am in the safe.
Huh?
In the safe?
Where?
You're in here.
I can't believe it.
You mean, you weren't crushed?
You?
You're not as big as a little cigar box?
Oh, master, please get me out of here.
Don't you worry.
Don't you worry, I will.
Make it soon, please.
Are you certain that safe is all right?
Yeah, sure.
Your girl called me just in time.
It's right over there.
Jeannie, I never knew how much you meant to me until this happened.
I'm never gonna let you out of my sight again.
Look, I I brought you some flowers.
As soon as I get you out of here, I'm gonna take you out to dinner.
I'm gonna buy you the best candlelight dinner A candlelight dinner?
Uh, well, I I can explain, sir.
It, uh  Explain?
Being in love with a safe?
They haven't even got a name for that one.
All right, major, are you sure you understand why I'm leaving this safe in your office?
Yes, sir, because I asked you to.
Mm.
And, um why did I agree?
Because you want me to realize that the safe is an inanimate object and it's silly for me to think I'm in love with it.
Excellent.
I think we're making progress.
Now, just keep repeating to yourself, "It's just a safe.
It's just a safe".
It's just a safe.
It's just a safe.
Master?
Shhh!
Ah, ah, ah.
Major, no backsliding.
It's just a safe.
Just Just a safe.
Jeannie, you've got to be more careful.
I am sorry, master, it's just that I hate it in here.
When are you going to get me out?
Any second now.
I just sent Roger to find a Mr. Charles Fries.
Who is Mr. Charles Fries?
Well, he's the guy who invented this thing.
He's gonna open it for us.
Oh, master, you are brilliant!
Thanks, Jeannie.
He's here, Tony.
Ah.
This is Mr. Charles Fries.
Oh, boy, am I glad to see you.
How do you do?
Yeah.
There it is, beautiful.
She's my masterpiece.
Could you open it?
We'd like to look inside.
What classic lines.
What artistry of design.
Yeah, well, if anybody can open this, you can, is that right?
That's right, major, and I can't.
What?
Gentlemen, when Charles Fries designs a safe to stay locked, it stays locked.
Well, somebody's gotta be able to open it.
Of course.
If you have the combination, you can open it.
Well, who has it?
The president The president?
Of the United States.
Of the United States?
Of the United States?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Jeannie?
Jeannie, darling, where are you?
Jeannie?
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
Aha.
Woo-hoo.
It's me, dear, your adorable sister, Jeannie.
Well Jeannie?
Jeannie Tsk.
Oh, wouldn't you know it?
She'd be the kind of ding-a-ling that's up and out at the crack of dawn.
Ahhh.
Well, well, well.
Alone and unprotected.
Tony, you ready?
Boy, what a day to oversleep.
Today's the day we get our assignment.
Tony?
Wake Oh.
Jeannie?
Jeannie's in our office.
Don't you remember?
What's she doing there?
We accidentally locked her in the safe, and she can't get out.
Now, come on.
Locked up in a safe?
Let her out.
We can't let her out because the president of the United States is the only one who has the combination.
Who?
The president of the United States.
The president of the United States?
Yeah.
Jeannie?
Are you in there?
Darling, it's me.
Sister?
Oh, Sister, you've come to let me out of here.
I'd be glad to, darling, if it weren't for a little matter of sibling rivalry.
Sibling rivalry, what is that?
Well, my square little sister, it means that you have got something I want.
And with you locked up in that cozy little safe, you won't be able to keep me from getting it.
Oh, well, you can have anything of mine you want.
Just name it.
What is it?
Well, it's about 6-foot-1.
It's got lovely brown hair, big blue eyes, and it's called My master?
Oh, no!
No, I would rather stay in here forever.
Well, your wish is my command.
Ciao.
Well, yes, Major Nelson.
You've drawn Area 25.
Oh, good.
Panama, Ecuador and the Guianas.
That's on the equator, sir.
I don't have to remind you, major, that keeping the world informed of our progress here at NASA is an important part of our job.
Where each man goes is, uh, just the luck of the draw.
Yes, sir.
Will that be all?
That'll be all, major.
Oh, uh, send in Major Healey, will you?
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
Yes, Major Healey, you're assigned to What is all that?
You know my motto, sir: "Always be prepared".
This is a speaking tour, major, not the Olympic games.
I know.
I didn't know where I was gonna be sent.
So I bought all this gear so I'd be ready to go anywhere.
Yes.
Well, this is your assignment.
Oh, don't tell me.
Don't tell me.
Oh, boy.
Paris?
Rome?
Switzerland?
"Cocoa Beach".
That's here, sir.
That's right, major.
We're, um We're having open house this week.
And you're in charge of showing the civic groups, the women's clubs and the schoolchildren through the base.
You don't know who might be going to Switzerland, do you, sir?
I think I could sell the That's your problem, major.
No problem.
Oh, uh, send in the next man, will you, please?
Yes, sir.
I, uh Heh.
Uh Oh, boy, Cocoa Beach.
How could Dr. Bellows do this to me?
That's the luck of the draw, Roge.
Yeah.
Hey, how'd you guys do?
Oh Don't ask.
That bad, huh?
Yeah.
I got lucky.
Middle East.
Shish kebab and belly dancers.
Yeah.
I drew the equator.
Mosquitoes and sunstroke.
Comin' through, comin' through.
While you two guys are fumbling around the world, graceful Roger has to stay here in Cocoa Beach.
Oh!
Watch your step, buddy!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Good luck, Tony.
Come on, graceful.
Sorry, miss.
Still in there, darling?
I just dropped by to say goodbye.
You are leaving?
Oh, yes.
I have just arranged for my master to leave for the Middle East, and, uh, I wouldn't dream of being parted from him.
Your master?
Hmm.
My new master, Major Nelson.
He is not your master.
He is my master.
Was, dear heart, was.
Heh, heh.
You can't do him much good locked up in there, now, can you?
Well, I I will get out of here.
I must.
Well, I don't see how, darling.
I'm certainly not going to help you.
And as for Major Nelson, once I get him on my home turf in Baghdad, he's going to have a rough time helping himself.
Ooh!
Well, I I I will tell him.
I will warn him.
Hmm.
You would too, wouldn't you?
Roge, it's not the end of the world, you know.
Uh, Jeannie, I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you.
Master!
Master!
Roge.
Roger!
I can't hear Jeannie.
Oh.
But I can arrange it so that he can hear me.
Take it easy.
Uh, Jeannie, I've gotta make a lecture tour in Latin America.
I'm gonna be gone for some time, but you don't have to worry.
Old Roger's gonna be here to take care of you.
Yeah, old Roge will be here to take care of her.
JEANNIE II : What a shame, master, that you were not sent to the Middle East to Baghdad.
Then you could look for Haji, the chief of the genies.
He could get me out of here.
Yeah, I know it's a shame, Jeannie, but my orders read Hey, look there.
Says, "Middle East".
How 'bout that?
It's your name on top.
Somebody must have goofed.
Wait, you must have switched papers with Arland.
No, it's impossible, Roger.
Wait a minute, don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Go.
What about Arland?
Think of what it'll do to him.
I'll get ahold of Haji as soon as I get there.
What is this?
Major Healey, if you don't mind.
Sorry.
You're still here, Major Nelson?
Yes, yes.
Oh, there it is, boys.
Now, be careful with that, will you, please?
What are you doing?
What?
Oh, I have good news for you.
We've scheduled another moonshot, and this time, it's going up.
But you can't do that, sir.
Now, I know how attached to it you are, major.
Dr. Bellows?
Yes?
Could you give me five minutes alone with it?
Pull yourself together, major.
What are you gonna do?
Only one thing to do.
What's that?
I've gotta go to Baghdad and find Haji.
Silks, effendi.
Fine silk.
Hey, hey, maybe you're the one who could help me.
Come here.
Do you know a guy named Haji?
Ah, Allah has guided your footsteps, effendi.
I am Haji.
I I mean, Haji, the chief of the genies.
Ha, ha!
The effendi wishes a genie.
Come closer, O blessed of the prophet.
I can help you.
This lamp, effendi, Effendi which you can purchase for a miserable 50 dinar, once belonged to the fabled Aladdin.
You have only to rub it and a genie will appear.
No, no, effendi.
He will try to cheat you, effendi!
With these magic scarves, heh, you may assume anything you wish.
Blind dog!
They are but cheap rags.
But with this lamp, effendi This lamp once belonged to Aladdin himself.
A miserable piece of tin, effendi.
This belonged to Aladdin.
You are selfish.
No, you don't understand.
I'm not really looking for that kind of thing.
What is it?
Oh, sorry, ma'am.
Whatever it is you're selling, I don't need anything.
You wish to find Haji, chief of the genies.
Haji Do you know where he is?
He is not far from here.
Follow me.
You bet.
Effendi, listen to me.
Would you?
This lamp, effendi, is capable of Give me my hat.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
You are a dog!
Hey, slow down, will you?
How much further?
Oh.
I'm sorry, ladies.
Oof!
Oh, get him!
Oh, wow.
No, it's all right.
I'll be all right.
Just Just let me sit down.
Aah!
Well, you don't really have to be that demonstrative.
No.
No, please  I'll have that.
Ladies, ladies, please.
Where am I, anyway?
In my master's harem.
Do you like it?
Yeah, well, it has a lot to recommend itself.
Isn't there some kind of a rule against this, huh?
Oh, don't lose your cool, major, baby.
I'll protect you.
Jeannie?
Your Jea You're Jeannie's sister!
Mm-hm.
You recognize me.
Well Oh, listen, I need your help.
Jeannie's locked up in a safe at NASA.
And they're gonna send her to the moon.
And you've gotta help me get her out.
Well, of course, darling.
In 20 or 30 years after I've gotten tired of you.
Mm?
Oh, yeah Oh, now, wait a minute.
Don't pull that over  Ha, ha.
What do you think, girls?
Isn't he a gas?
Wha?
Uh, girls?
Ladies?
Hi, would you come over here, please?
Hi, hi, how are you?
I don't know if you know it or not, but kidnapping is a very serious offense.
And you could get in a lot of trouble, you know.
Why don't you let me out of here, and then I'll just forget about the whole thing, huh?
Ahem.
You know, miss, uh, somebody's forgotten to feed me today, yeah.
I'm hungry.
You You know, hungry.
No, no, no.
Hungry, hungry.
Num-a-num-num.
The universal language, uh Miss, miss, come here.

Say, uh Say, you're beautiful, you know.
You're really gorgeous, yeah.
Yeah, that's right.
That's That's what you are.
I can go for you in a big way, but I'm in here and you're out there.
See, me in here, you out there?
All All you have to do is just open the door.
Open this cage door.
Wasn't I just in that?
Well, hi.
Oh, that's very nice.
Thank you, thank you.
I know.
Ha, ha, ha.
No, really, really, I can't.
I've got duty to do.
I've got a thing Don't!
Ladies, I'd I'd love to.
I really would.
But I have my own little genie in a bottle at  You wouldn't begin to understand.
Could you just show me the way out of here, huh?
But of course, darling.
Hi.
Right through that cage.
That cage?
Now, look here, young lady, I don't think you realize that I'm here on official business.
When NASA hears that I'm missing, they're gonna send someone to look for me.
Oh, I'm sure they will.
But frankly, darling, I don't think they'll be looking in a Baghdad harem in a birdcage.
Ah.
Nighty-night.
Tut, tut, tut.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, Major Healey.
I can't stop now, sir.
Why not?
Top priority.
The Ladies Civic Betterment League are waiting.
Major, they can wait.
Would you mind telling me what Major Nelson is doing in Baghdad?
Baghdad?
Oh, well, that was his assignment, wasn't it, sir?
No, it wasn't, major.
Arland was assigned to the Middle East.
Why don't you ask Major Arland, sir?
I can't.
He's in Latin America.
Well, that's all very interesting, sir, but the tea's getting cold, and I Major Nelson has disappeared.
The authorities in Baghdad have been searching for him for 24 hours.
I've just alerted our consulate.
Tony disappeared?
Oh, that's terrible.
Do you know any reason why he'd wanna go to Baghdad?
No, sir, but I'll find out.
Just hold it, sir.
Uh, Major Healey, come back here.
Third door to the right.
Cream and sugar's on the table.
ROGER : Jeannie?
Oh, Jeannie, I got great news.
Tony's in Baghdad, and he's been missing for 24 hours.
I think he found Haji.
Oh, no, Major Healey.
That is terrible news.
It means that my sister must have captured him.
Your sister?
What's your sister got to do with it?
She was here.
She tricked my master into going to Baghdad.
But, Jeannie, you suggested that.
Mm-mm.
No, it was my sister.
Oh, major, you must help him.
Okay.
I'm ready.
Major Healey?
Aren't you gonna blink me?
I cannot.
You mean, I have to fly there myself?
But I will tell you where to look for my master.
Go to the big bazaar.
Take the street on the right.
Go seven quintals, no more, no less.
Seven quintals.
Turn left.
You will see a big palace, and that is where my sister's master lives.
Yeah, now, let me get this right.
We go to the big bazaar, and we take the first street to the right.
Then we turn seven quintals Whom, may I ask, are you talking to?
Well, I was, uh, talking to Oh, I was just going over my strategy for when I go to Baghdad.
And who said you were going to Baghdad?
Well, you did, sir.
I'm going to get Tony, and I, uh Wish me luck, sir.
Uh, Major Healey, the tea.
Oh, no, thank you, sir.
I'm a coffee man, myself.
Thanks.
Now, you've got your 200 dinars for the magic silks.
And here's your 500 dinars for Aladdin's lamp.
Now.
Now can you tell me what a quintal is?
Yes, it is very easy, effendi.
You put one foot in front of the other foot, then you multiply by four.
No, no, no, you divide by three.
You son of a dog, you multiply by four.
By the son of Allah, you are a dog.
You multiply by four.
You are cursed dog.
Allah has put raisins into your eyes.
You are a dog!
Hi.
Heh.
You're here on business.
Here to find Tony.

MAN : Where are you?
Ah.
There you are.
Hello, girls.

I thought you would be in Switzerland, skiing at least another month.
With a genie like you, I cannot risk an extended vacation.
What mischief have you been up to?
Me?
None.
I was just feeding the birds.
Oh, yes, my pets.

Which of you wishes to die first, huh?
Oh, not me, I'm just a tourist.
Thanks, Roge.
Infidel dogs.
I will teach you to steal my genie.
No, no, you had it all wrong.
She stole me.
She's the one that kidnapped me.
Really, honestly.
Oh, what would she want with the likes of you, huh?
Well, I I I really don't know.
Wench.
With that one, it is possible.
Heh.
Do you wish me to fix them some shish kebab, master?
Do they speak the truth?
Well You lie, and I will seal you in amber forever.
Well, I only wanted them for pets.
Look Look what you've done to my coat.
My apologies, gentlemen.
Habib is in your debt.
She will grant you one wish.
And then I will kill her.
Well, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Done.
You have your wish.
Now we are even.
You get rid of them.
Ahhh.
We're back!
We're home!
Oh, we're back home.
Hey, you blew it.
What are you talking about?
We could have wished Jeannie out of the safe.
Oh, don't worry.
Jeannie's gonna be all right.
Huh?
Look.
Jean!
They're gonna send her to the moon!
We gotta get outta here.
Hey, Jeannie!
Roger, will you?
Wait a minute, I wanna watch this.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Jeannie?
Oh, master, is that you?
Oh, what day is it?
It's It's Tuesday.
Exactly four weeks to the day that you got locked in that safe.
Now, d-d-don't worry about a thing.
I'm working on a way to get you out.
It is too late, former master.
No, what are you talking about, it's too late?
Former master?
According to the laws of the Great Djinn, after a genie has been locked up for a full moon, she no longer belongs to her master.
Well, who does she belong to?
Anyone who lets her out.
Do you mean, anybody?
Just anybody that opens this safe?
Anybody.
D-don't panic.
I'll find a way to get you out of there.
This way, gentlemen.
Oh, Jeannie, don't you let anybody open that safe.
What are you doing here?
There it is, men.
Oh, I was just checking on the moon safe, sir.
W-what are they doing here?
Moving it out to a concrete-reinforced blockhouse.
Carefully, men.
Now, remember, that has an explosive device.
I-I thought it was to stay here until it went up.
A slight change in plans.
We're opening it up.
Open it?
Dr. Wedemeyer thinks the explosive mechanism may be activated.
Exp Dr. Wedemeyer?
A Dr. Friedrich Wedemeyer.
He's the Pentagon's top demolition expert.
He's arriving at 1:00 from Washington with the combination.
Sir, this is a NASA project.
I think the NASA personnel should follow through.
As a matter of fact, I'd like to volunteer to be the one That's out of the question.
It's far too dangerous.
That's why we're putting it in the blockhouse, and calling in Wedemeyer.
He's going to open the safe.
He's Yes.
This way, men.
I'm telling you, there isn't enough time.
Roger, there's gotta be.
Do you want Wedemeyer to be Jeannie's master?
If we stop Wedemeyer from opening the safe, Jeannie will never get out, either way we lose.
Roger, we're a team.
In a crisis, we've been trained to be ingenious, self-reliant and cool.
I think I may panic.
I'm planning this very carefully.
The way I see it, this mission is in two phases.
Yeah.
First, one of us delays Wedemeyer.
Second, one of us steals the safe.
Which one do you want?
I think I'll take number three.
No matter how you look at it, I mean, the whole mission's impossible.
Not if we use our heads.
Here's your operational plans.
You take phase one.
Every step is precisely outlined.
Memorize it.
Well, you really got this thing worked out Oh, wait, panel.
Oh, no, not me.
You realize what's gonna happen if we get caught doing that?
No, not me.
You got it memorized?
Yeah, I got it memorized but it'll never work.
Think positive.
Yeah, think positive.
We won't go through that.
I know what you're thinking.
All right, Roger.
What's the first thing you do?
The first thing Here's a copy.
Here's your original.
What personal escort?
I don't know what you're talking about.
You mean to tell me you're going to allow.
Dr. Friedrich Wedemeyer, one of the most eminent scientists of our time, to come to Cocoa Beach on his own?
Well, frankly, I didn't see the necessity, but now that you mention it Well, it's a great honor having him here, sir.
It's a great childhood hero of mine.
Oh, really?
Yes, it's too bad I'm busy.
It's just an hour here by, uh To Washington by jet.
Well, I'd better be going, sir.
Just a minute.
Yes, sir?
Maybe we should give him the VIP treatment.
Whatever you say, sir.
My plane is warming up.
Plane?
What plane?
I'm scheduled for two hours of flying time to stay qualified.
That's perfect.
What's perfect?
Major, you will fly to Washington and pick up Dr. Wedemeyer.
I'll phone to make the necessary arrangements.
Here's his number at the Pentagon.
But, sir There are no buts, major.
That's an order.
It worked.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, nothing.
Whatever you say, sir.
Yes, sir, gentlemen?
Two sticks, there you go, right here.
Change for a coin.
All right, one for you.
Yes, sir?
Oh, watermelon.
Very, very good, good.
Yes, sir, same thing?
Oh, very good, sir.
Right away.
There you go.
ICE CREAM  Hey, ice cream here!
Hey, ice cream!
Ice cream here!
Hey, hey, ice cream!
Hi, how's business, Joe?
Oh, couldn't be better, major.
I tell ya, the warmer it gets, the better it is for me.
What'll it be today, sir, the usual?
Joe, I wanna buy your whole stock.
Whole stock?
Major, you'll get sick.
Joe, I'm gonna need your help.
Can you take orders and not ask questions?
Gee, ask my wife.
Here's what I want you to do.
Yeah?
Oh, Dr. Wedemeyer, my name is Roger Healey  Shhh!
Please!
One drop too many of this, we could blow the whole building up in smoke.
Sorry, sir.
Two drops, and-d-d we could blow up Cleveland.
Oh, but three drops, wonderful for heartburn.
You would like to have some?
No, no, no, sir.
I'm Major Healey.
I'm, uh I'm your personal escort to NASA.
Oh, yeah, they told me that.
Look, I wanna warn you something.
I have a very weak stomach.
You know, with the flying, I don't do much of that.
Sir, y-you do have the combination to the safe?
Oh, yes, I got it personal from the president.
I-Is it in there, sir?
No, Mr. Personal Escort.
In here.
Right this way, sir.
I tell you what.
It will be a nice, easy flight.
You'll have no problems at all, sir.
Thank you very much.
It's okay, major, nobody saw me.
Now, what's my secret assignment?
Look busy.
Sell me something.
A malt-o-pop with a cherry in it?
I don't care.
Sun-on-a-stick?
I don't care.
How about a sandwich?
Will you?
Your first job is this.
Go to the movies.
Go to the movies?
Here's a ticket to the Bijou.
That's at 5:42, at which time you'll find your ice cream cart at the south gate.
Got it?
Got it.
Joe?
Yeah?
Enjoy the movies.
Major?
Yeah?
Enjoy the ice cream.
Jeannie.
Is that you, oh, beloved former master?
Don't worry about a thing.
If everything goes as planned, you'll be able to call me master again.
Promise me that you will not let anyone else open this safe.
I-I promise, Jeannie.
Roger's making sure Wedemeyer doesn't even get here.
Say, Cocoa Beach is south.
Why do you flying west?
Detour, sir, the bridge is out.
Heh?
Bad weather, sir.
What are you talking about?
Not a cloud in the sky here.
Downdraft, very dangerous.
Oh, that's Ohhh!
That was one of them, sir.
Don't talk, just fly, please.
What are you doing?
Jeannie, it's too complicated to explain right now.
From now on, I don't want you to say a word until I tell you it's safe.
Anything you say.
I say so.
Oh, uh, Joe, just a minute.
Hi, hi, colonel, uh, don't get too close.
I got a case of laryngitis.
Oh, I'm sorry, Joe.
Well, I'm a doctor, let me take a look.
No, no, it's all right.
I had my personal physician take a look.
He says it's gonna be okay.
I think I'll have, uh, a sundae today.
A sundae?
Well, I'm fresh, uh Fresh out of sundaes, colonel.
Okay, then, let's make it a malt-o-pop.
Malt-o-pop?
We had a big run on malt-o-pops, I'm out of them too.
Come on, you must have something in there for a regular customer.
I'll take a look.
No.
No, it's all Oh Uh, as a matter of fact, I do have something here.
Here, on the house, try that.
You're keeping one in your pocket?
I've got to take it home to the kids.
You know how they are.
See you.
Enjoy it, will you?
Thank you.
Out of gas, you dummkopf.
How could we be out of gas?
Well, we got caught in a downdrift.
W-we drifted a little off course, sir.
Lucky we found the open field though.
Yeah.
Where are we?
Well, we're about 100 miles west of the base, right?
That's right, a hundred miles.
Look, I want to tell you something, major.
It is urgent that I am in Cocoa Beach to open that safe by 1:00.
Oh, yes, sir, I know You understand?
I understand.
Why don't you sit down, and I'll call the base and have them send a helicopter?
Yes, helicopter.
Send something.
Phone's over here, right?
Yeah, back there.
Oh, Major Healey.
Major Healey.
Major Healey.
Oh, hi, Dr. Bellows.
The tower just called me and said you landed.
Uh, where's Dr. Wedemeyer?
Dr. Wedemeyer?
Oh, we had a little trouble, sir.
He got airsick, and I had to set him down.
You set him down?
Where?
Oh, about 100 miles west of here.
What a foolish It's all right, don't worry.
I'm picking him up in my car.
We should be a few hours late.
Late?
He can't be late.
He has to open that safe at 1:00, or it'll explode.
Well, I could have him here by Did you say explode?
That's right, major.
That explosive mechanism is on a timer.
In two hours, it switches over to self-destruct.
And then it arms itself and poof.
You mean, in two hours the safe is going to go poof?
That's right major.
Poof.
I tell you, that safe's not safe anymore.
That's a bomb.
It's 11:15.
We have exactly an hour and 45 minutes to disarm it.
I've got 11:10.
And we synchronize watches.
Roger, would you forget about that?
What did you do with Wedemeyer?
That's funny, I just had it cleaned.
I've never lost time before.
I can even hear it ticking.
That's not your watch.
That's the safe.
Oh, yeah.
Master, what is that noise?
I am frightened.
Jeannie, don't worry about a thing.
We'll get you out before it goes off.
Where's Wedemeyer?
About 100 miles west of here.
Get him, bring him here.
Yeah.
Uh, Jeannie, in case I don't get back in time Roger!
Master, but what if Major Healey does not get back in time?
He's got to.
Dr. Wedemeyer!
Oh, doctor Where is he, sir?
Who?
The man I left here, Dr. Wedemeyer.
Boy, he was sure mad.
You should've Where is he?
Oh, he left.
Phone company truck gave him a lift.
Believe me, doctor, I can't imagine why Major Healey would do such a thing.
He said that you were his childhood hero.
Well, that's a fine way to show it, what he'd done to me in the airplane.
Look at me, I'm shaking.
Believe me, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this, I promise you.
Now, you're gonna get to the bottom.
Where was you when he was doing with me the loop-the-loop?
Do you need any help, doctor?
No, no.
Nobody goes in there when I work on that safe.
Including me.
I-I mean, you.
Open the door, please.
Thank you.
Okay.
Ice cream sandwich.
They're all crazies around here.
Another crazy.
Don't say anything.
The slightest movement could set it off.
Could set what off?
An ice cream case?
The earthquake.
My name is Nelson.
I'm with the NASA seismological unit.
We've discovered a major fault running directly beneath this blockhouse.
We've been receiving temblors all morning.
Under here you say there are faults?
No.
Doctor, you know how sensitive these things are, as a scientist.
And naturally we've had to remove the safe.
Now, if you'd just walk towards me, please.
You mean, under here there are Doctor!
The floor could open up and swallow you up immediately.
Now, come this way, please.
I don't think so.
I think I better go this way, because that fellow, you know, the colonel Stop!
That's where the major stress is, by the door.
You're gonna have to come out the window, come on, please.
The window?
Yeah.
In my age, with climbing the windows?
Do you know you could give me the hardening of the arteries?
You can start on it right now, sir.
No, no, no, look.
P-please, major, I don't feel so good.
Better I sit down on We haven't got time to sit down.
In 15 minutes, this thing is gonna blow sky-high.
All right.
Where will I sit?
Major, you better evacuate the neighborhood.
Doctor, you give me the directions, I'll defuse the safe.
All right.
We'll try it.
We'll try it.
Then I take out everything, and I show you I say I show you.
You don't touch.
This is a schlager.
Yeah, I got that.
All right.
This you ought to know by yourself.
See, this is a transmitter.
Come, put yourself over here.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This I put on here.
Yeah.
You take this here.
Look what I'm looking, can you?
Yes, yes.
And you make it go on the surface of the safe.
Around the combination and keep it going there.
See, now, I watch on the scope.
And when you get to there, I say, "Halt, stop it".
That is where we are going to drill, all right?
Okay, okay.
Go, make that.
Stop.
Hold it right there.
Now, you see what you done?
You've got either, where the trembler device is.
And this is where we have to drill the hole, you see?
Where?
Wait, wait, I show you.
Go, again.
Now, you take this Make with a mark, there.
Yeah.
You see?
All right.
Now, that shows you that you go in a two-inches diameter around the trembler device.
Yeah.
And if you miss as much as a fraction of a millimeter Don't worry about it, sir.
Right here?
I hope so.
That's good, good.
Hold it, here.
There's the drill.
Give me, I take that from you.
There's the drill.
Now, please with a steady hand, huh?
There, that's got it.
All right, that's good, that's good.
Now, connect up the holes with this.
See the way it goes?
Yes.
All right, but hurry.
We got five minutes.
Never mind what time it is.
Saw the hole.
This thing's ticking faster.
That means we're getting close.
Saw faster.
Good, good, good.
Very good.
Now, you take this suction cup, and put carefully on here, and it removes the trembler device.
Then I cut the wires.
You see that?
All right.
It's 1:00.
Yeah, but that don't make no difference.
You go slowly now.
Good, good.
Move some.
Easy.
Good boy.
Cut it.
Cut it.
It's 1:00.
Cut it!
Oh.
Jeez, I need a drink.
All right, I'll go get you something.
Please.
Now, we've got to get you open.
Four, four, yeah.
Nine.
Don't open that safe!
Don't open it.
What are you talking about?
It's already defused.
What do I hear?
I hear some noise, something.
Major, there's something that's ticking in here.
There's another fuse.
There's another fuse.
Run.
I hear it, get out, get out, get out.
Run!
Jeannie.
You can come out now.
Come on out the hole.
Jeannie, come on, he's gone.
I got rid of him.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
All right now, let's be calm, I can open it myself.
I know the first two digits, he's already done them.
All I have to do is get the third one, right.
Now I don't know the third one.
I don't know the third digit.
I don't know the third digit.
What's the matter with me?
I Wait a minute.
He's already dialed the first two digits.
And be calm.
All I need is the third digit.
All I have to do is try them all.
On the third digit, I'll dial everything.
One.
Two.
Three.
Four.
Five.
Six.
Seven  I heard a click.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, I think that's it.
Jeannie, the number is four-nine-seven.
Four-nine-seven.
That's it.
Jeannie, the number was four-nine-seven.
Jeannie?
Oh.
Oh, master, I am free.
Oh, master!
Jeannie, come out.
Oh, I am out.
I am out, master.
Oh, my darling, adorable master.
I love you.
Jeannie, you're out.
Hi, Roger.
Oh, boy, is it good to have you back.
Oh, it's good to be out.
Oh!
Now, our problems are over.
I cannot believe it.
That's where he goes.
Hurry, doctor.
Jeannie, out.
This time, gentlemen, you're really in trouble.
What kind of trouble?
You stole that safe.
That safe?
Oh, no, sir.
You see, when we found out that a major fault was running beneath the blockhouse and There are no faults or earthquakes in Florida.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Surprise, master.
Surprise, Major Healey.
Hey.
I am preparing luncheon.
Is it not scrumptious?
Mmm.
I could eat a horse.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, if that is what you wish.
No, no, Jeannie.
No horses and no lunch.
Roger and I volunteered for a nutritional experiment at the base hospital.
Yeah, duty.
I'll get it.
Oh, but, master, you know how cranky you get when you do not eat.
Yeah, no, this is duty, Jeannie.
Really.
Yes, but this is red meat, whole protein.
Dr. Bellows!
It's Dr. Bellows, he's here.
Uh, would you pop out now, Jeannie?
Please?
Oh, master, the steaks will burn.
Dr. Bellows is gonna drive us to the base hospital, please.
Thank you.
Okay.
What are you doing up there?
Dr. Bellows!
Oh, it's him.
Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows.
Well, are you ready and eager to get underway, gentlemen?
Oh, yes, quite ready.
Right.
You seem rather tense.
Oh, me?
No, no, no, I'm moose as a loose Noose as a goose You know what I mean.
Of course, I understand.
At first, I couldn't imagine why you were eager to volunteer your services.
And then I remembered the new Swedish nurses at the hospital.
Naive of me, wasn't it?
Swedish nurses?
Well, how about that?
Did you know there were Swedish nurses over at the hospital?
You kidding?
You mean Sonia and Ingrid, the beautiful girls?
Let's go, sir.
Whatever Oh, yeah, well, I mean, you know, you just have to They're a little ugly there.
They've got big noses and hair like spaghetti.
Well, we'll just have to bear it, huh?
Ha-ha-ha!
Duty, duty.
Oh, thanks.
Thank you very much, thank you.
Oh, thanks for setting that up for us.
Thank you, bye.
Ho-ho-ho!
Goodbye, see you later.
Goodbye.
Well, my three looked great.
I can't believe that we're here.
Did you see those blonds Greta and Ingrid and Sonia?
Yeah, Greta's the one with the big Master!
Nose and skinny legs and knobbly knees.
Yeah.
Oh, hey, look who's here.
Now, I know what you're thinking and you're absolutely wrong.
We volunteered for this job, Jeannie.
Ooh!
Now, now, now Hey, wait.
Oh.
There you are.
What did you?
Get it off.
Come on, pull it down.
Here we are, commander.
Uh, Commander Porter intends to use you to prove that the astronaut nutrition program is inadequate.
That's right.
I'm really gonna put the pressure on you.
Brutal hard pressure.
And if you think your astronaut diet of rich food and ladyfingers is gonna keep you going, you're wrong.
Boys, in just 24 hours, I'm gonna reduce you to broken, sniveling wrecks.
For For the good of our country, of course.
And, uh what have you to, uh, say to that?
Sounds great.
Can't wait.
Good.
I like doomed men to show spirit.
Ha-ha-ha!
Okay, let's warm up with, uh, Uh, t-the water tower, sir?
That's on the roof, Dr. Bellows.
That's 12 floors.
You do mean for them to take the elevator, don't you?
Up the fire escape.
Go.
Faster.
Four hundred and ninety-nine.
Five hundred.
Fifty more.
Till you drop.
Commander Porter's vitamin pill.
I see those nurses have worn you out.
Jeannie, we're in the hands of a madman.
Ha!
No, honestly, the nurses didn't have anything to do with it.
I I Tell her, Roge.
Tell her, tell Jeannie.
Jeannie, he's trying to kill us.
No, not that.
Jeannie Oh!
Oh, Jeannie.
Oh, are we glad to see you.
Jeannie, look at me.
Look Look at me.
Look at my hollow eyes.
My sunken cheeks.
We've been starved, steamed and strained.
Why did you not tell me this Commander Porter was mistreating you?
Why didn't we tell her?
Because Oh, well, I guess it was just his foolish pride.
You are sure you have not been having fun with these nurses?
My word of honor.
And you are very hungry?
Yeah, hungry.
Starved.
Oh, so hungry.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Food!
Oh, remind me to have your bottle air-conditioned.
Yes, Roge.
Mmm.
Oooh.
Major Nelson.
Major Healey.
Your favorite nurse is here again.
You naughty boys.
Naughty boys?
Oh, no, no, it's not what you think.
Ohhh.
No, it really isn't.
Jeannie, now, now, don't Don't take your food.
Here, get Oh!
Ow!
Ow!
Jeannie, come back.
Time to take more blood, dear boys.
Ha-ha-ha!
Amazing.
You know something, Healey?
You and Nelson have lost enough fat to make a full-grown jockey.
I can't tell you how this pleases me.
How much longer is this gonna take, sir?
Oh, we're just getting started.
Yes, sir, we're just getting started.
I want Dr. Bellows to see you.
Oh, uh, come along, Miss, uh, Lugosi.
You can take more blood later.
That should put a smile on your face.
Oh, my poor master.
I saw everything and I am so ashamed.
I am not fit to be your genie.
I am a complete flip.
Flop.
Flop.
Jeannie, is that you?
Oh.
Poor sweet master.
You have grown so skinny, even your head feels thin.
Oh, but do not worry.
I shall arrange a feast of the ages.
Poached ears of the camel.
Pomegranates and honey.
Hummingbird's feet.
Ohhh.
Hold the bird feet, Jeannie, it's too late.
I think we've had it.
Oh, we're too bushed to move.
Well, then I will unbush you.
I'm up.
I'm moving.
I feel great.
I feel like a tiger.
Ha-ha-ha!
Now no one will be ashamed of you.
Jeannie, Jeannie, it's too fast.
Slow us down.
Oh.
Oh, take it easy, Jeannie.
We're going too fast.
Too fast.
Slow us down.
Wait a minute.
We're too fast.
Oh, dear.
I think my unbushing spell needs work.
What shape are they in, commander?
I'd say they we're shapeless.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
It's pitiful.
No stamina, colonel.
No stamina.
Well, look for yourself.
Incredible.
Sickening the way those chowhounds fell apart, isn't it?
Fell apart?
You better take another look, commander.
I don't know how they're doing it but they're hopping around like jumping beans on a skillet.
What?
Let me see.
I say this proves that your analysis of the astronaut's diet was incorrect.
No, I I was right.
Their diet was trash.
What's keeping those boys going is my special vitamin pills.
Your vitamin pills?
Secret formula.
I broke 'em down, but my pills built 'em right up again.
They can take it.
Now, I can hit 'em with the real test.
Five days and nights on Skull Island without supplies.
Living off the land like wild animals.
Wild animals?
Well, do you think they can take it, commander?
Look at 'em.
I'll give 'em the works.
The works.
Skull Island.
Well, gentlemen, do you think you're ready to withstand five days of animal survival here?
Does fainting answer your question?
Never mind, they're ready.
You have plenty of my special vitamins and these little beauties.
The Commander Porter Handbook for Survival.
Use these properly and you won't starve, understand?
And if we get hungry, we can eat the book.
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha!
That's the spirit.
Commander, starvation is not the real danger.
No?
The real danger is the mental disorientation that accompanies acute hunger.
It may impair their judgment and cause frightening hallucinations.
Don't worry, doc.
Nobody's gonna start seeing things.
My vitamins and my handbooks will pull us through.
All right, men.
Let's go to work.
Scrounge!
Scrounge.
Ohhh.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy.
Phew!
Oh, boy, I don't know about you, but I'm starved.
Oh, do not worry, Jeannie is here.
What are you?
What are you doing here?
Oh, thanks, Jeannie, but no thanks.
We can't.
You do not like turkey and cranberries and And sweet potatoes and white potatoes and pickles.
No, you see, Commander Porter is taking the same test with us.
He's eating everything we do.
It's him against us.
Right, we're gonna beat him at his own game.
Yeah.
I think you are both being very foolish.
If you do not eat, you are going to get sick.
Nelson, Healey, yo!
Get out, go on, out.
Take this with you, go on.
Well, well.
Hey, sir.
Came up empty-handed, didn't you, from the hunt?
Well, lucky for you, Commander Porter's a master at the art of food-finding.
Yeah.
Today, we feast.
Yes, sir.
Swamp roots, lily buds, nice juicy snails.
Here, boys, try one of the crickets.
They're delicious.
Hey, uh y-you guys smell roast turkey?
Yeah, we smell turkey No, we can't be smelling roast turkey.
If we were smelling roast turkey, we'd be having a hallucination.
And we can't be having a hallucination, not with The Commander Porter Handbook for Survival.
Ha-ha!
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, I-I didn't smell roast turkey.
Come on, Healey, chomp on a snail.
No, I I don't smell roast turkey or cranberry sauce and pumpkin pie.
Uh, check?
Check.
I don't even smell oyster dressing.
No.
Hey, this looks good.
Funny, uh Well, chow down.
"First man lures fish in close by making sounds in water's surface".
Okay, Nelson.
Huh?
Make sounds in water's surface.
"Second man readies spear and strikes when the fish approaches".
Ready, Healey?
Oh!
I think I see something, sir.
Here goes.
Get anything?
Yes, sir.
My foot.
You must let me help you, master.
You are getting weaker by the minute.
No, no, I'm gonna do it.
Ohhh, I will not allow my master to go hungry.
I know, I will fix you a A A Cornish hen.
No, a squab with No, that is not big enough for two hungry men.
I know.
A nice big chicken.
Oh, dear.
Oh!
No, no, no, no.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Eh, Commander Porter here.
Are you alone?
Yes, I am, commander.
What seems to be the difficulty?
A turkey dinner that wasn't there?
There's nothing wrong with you, commander.
Uh, don't ask me how I know, but believe me, you're as sane as I am.
Just take two aspirins and stay away from Major Nelson and Major Healey.
Thanks, doc.
I-I knew my Porter system wouldn't fail me.
I feel a lot better.
W-what?
Uh, sorry, I couldn't hear you on account of the giant chicken.
A giant chicken.
Giant chicken?
I don't see a giant chicken.
Jeannie, now you get rid of that thing.
You just get rid of it.
Yes, master.
All right.
All right.
All right, uh, please just don't try to help us anymore.
Roger, let's go and try to find some real food, huh?
Oh, please, master, let me get you some food.
No, Jeannie, we're not allowed to accept food unless it's from the natives, like it says in the handbook.
Yeah, come on.
Yeah.
"Food and shelter may sometimes be found at a friendly native village".
No Th-there was no chicken.
Dr. Bellows knows what he's talking about.
I didn't see nothing.
All right.
Friendly native village.
Looks like one But it isn't here.
M-m-m-my vitamins.
I'll take some more of my vitamins.
When I open my eyes, it'll It'll all be gone.
All gone.
You may accept this food, please.
We are friendly native village.
Just like in your book.
You aren't here.
It's like I could just reach out and touch you but But you're not here.
It's a What do you call it?
A A mirage.
That's what it is, a mirage.
And I'll I'll I'll prove it, it's a mirage.
Infidel dog.
You have desecrated the tents of the women.
For this, you must die.
D-die?
Wh-what am I worried about?
There's nobody here.
I'm all alone with a big hairy mirage.
You don't exist.
Seize him.
Th-this isn't happening.
Uh, put me down, fellows, will you?
Put me down.
Oh.
Master?
Master?
Put me down.
"Approach nest from north side of tree.
Carefully remove eggs".
Ungh!
Uh, steady, little to the right, okay?
Okay.
Look, pull.
Master!

Be careful will you.
Huh?
Master!
Oh, master!
What is it?
Danger What's that?
Huh?
Oh, sorry, Roge.
Oh, Major Healey.
Oh, master, please hurry, you must go.
What is it?
Oh, there's no time to explain.
You aren't here.
That big knife isn't gonna hurt anybody.
And that bevy of handclapping beauties ain't here, neither.
What a great mirage.
If this was real, I'd, uh, sure be worried.
What is it?
Oh, Cousin Hamid, no!
Do not kill him.
The infidel must die.
Who are they?
Oh, friends, this is Cousin Hamid.
This is my beloved master Major Nelson and Major Healey.
Welcome to my humble village.
My tent is your tent.
And now, if you will excuse me, I must cut your friend to ribbons.
Uh, wait.
Wait.
Hi, Nelson.
You in my mirage too?
Hi.
Can't you help?
Can't you help him?
That is Cousin Hamid.
Ha!
What's the matter, big stuff?
Can't you aim good?
Oh, now my mirage is mad.
Why don't you try it again?
Now you pay.
For a mirage, you have terrible breath.
No, no Did you do it?
Did you?
I cannot kill a man who shows no fear.
His courage has won him life and the right to wear the robes of Hadjibaba.
Oh.
But thank you, cousin, for a very entertaining diversion.
I will see you in 2000 years at the family picnic?
Dress will be casual.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Don't bother.
I know the way out.
Bye-bye.
Well  You see?
I knew it would work out all right.
Oh.
Let's get Porter off that stake.
Oh, master, the robes of Hadjibaba.
Yeah, never mind that, come on.
Whoa!
Oh.
Are you all right?
You all right?
Hi, Nelson.
Hi, Healey.
You're here too.
Gee, what a crowded mirage.
Where'd you get her?
Never mind.
I'll snap out of this and you'll all be gone.
Uh, sir, I think we'd better explain Step back.
I'd like to try out this big knife.
That guy in the mirage really tried to give it to me.
Hey, you know something?
This knife is real.
Whoa!
Are you all right, sir?
Are you all right, sir?
Commander Porter?
Are you all right, sir?
Major Healey, commander, can you hear me?
Oh, it must be Dr. Bellows.
Oh, it must be a search party.
How are we gonna?
How are we gonna explain Sheikh Ali Ben Porter?
Um, Jeannie?
Oh, well, you will think of something.
I wish I could.
Yeah Oh.
Oh, are you all right?
Sir?
Sir?
Jeannie, will you come back?
Jeannie.
Mirage.
It was real.
Nelson.
Yes, sir.
Healey, it was real!
Yes, yes.
The knife.
It It's gone, but it was here.
It was right here.
Sir, you're weak from lack of food.
Don't baby me.
There was a giant with a beard and And tents and a blond.
Sir, you're an inspiration to all your men, giving us your food like that.
A-and the giant chicken, I saw it too.
A-and this knife Where's the knife?
He tried to cut me to ribbons.
No, no, no.
I gave you my food?
Yes.
No, I had on this weird housecoat, a-and my shoes curled up at the toes.
Dr. Bellows is Is searching for us, sir.
Uh, uh, let me explain what happened.
After the landslide   And so, gentlemen, although the space agency was disappointed in the failure of Commander Porter's program, they were most impressed with your showing.
We only did our duty, sir.
We learned from Commander Porter's example.
Mmm, it was his principles of self-sacrifice.
I'm glad to hear you say that because the Department of Defense would like you to share the survival techniques.
Ah, come in, sir.
Hi, fella.
It's me.
Now, you're going to show me how you did it.
We're going back out to Skull Island and we're gonna stay there until I know everything you know.
So stop sitting there like lard-bellied yo-yos and move.
Move!
Roge.

Hello.
And, uh, uh, Major Healey.
How do you do?
Uh, I-I have some interesting news for you.
You see, we represented your late Great Uncle Andrew in England.
Oh, I did not know you had a late Great Uncle Andrew.
Oh, yeah, I met him when I was about 3 years old.
I don't even remember him.
Ah, well, he remembered you.
He left you his entire estate in England.
Oh, master!
Yeah.
Now, uh, this is the main house.
There are several other buildings on the estate.
Oh, I'd sure like to have the butler concession here.
Would you love to have this in Cocoa Beach?
No, no, that's That's fine.
Good evening, Mr. Ashley.
Ah, good evening, Smedley.
This is your new master, Major Nelson.

Allow me.
Oh, please don't bother.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The electricity's out, but not to worry.
This way, please.
Quite a place.
Must be the housekeeper's day off.
Nonsense.
This house has stood nearly 300 years.
And it should stand for 300 more.
Hey, that must be my Great Uncle Andrew over there, huh?
Well, it certainly has a lot of atmosphere.
Oh, when it is fixed up, it will be beautiful.
Just like a home in the movies.
Yeah.
Yeah, only Frankenstein used to live there.
Ah, the major suddenly has a marvelous sense of humor.
No, I'm serious, this place seems haunted.
Nonsense.
Surely you don't believe in ghosts.
Oh, I do.
No, no, of course not.
Yes, I do.
No, you don't.
Look at this stuff.
Isn't this beautiful?
All these antiques, they're all mine.
Look at this, Jeannie.
Isn't that sensational?
I'll bet you this thing's It's all mine.
Oh, I-I'm so sorry, major.
I-I shall have that reupholstered in the morning.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thanks a lot.
I-I'm I'm sure you'll spend a very happy life here, major.
Well, you You could use it as a summer place.
Yes, sure, and when we weren't here, I could rent it.
Ah, that's an excellent idea.
I think I know how Uncle Andrew got killed.
Just what do you mean by that?
Nothing, nothing.
Uh, H-how did Uncle Andrew die?
Oh, he died in his sleep.
In bed?
In bed?
In bed.
Your beds are ready.
Smedley has prepared the upstairs bedrooms.
I'm sure you all must be very exhausted.
Yes, yes, we are kind of tired.
Well, I'll be running along to London now.
If you want anything, just ring, and Smedley will be at your complete disposal.
I'll be back in the morning with the proper papers for you to sign.
And then the house will be officially yours.
I'm sure you'll sleep well.
There's nothing like the fresh country air for a good night's sleep.
Good night.
Good night.
Thanks, again.
Yes, bye, sir.
Happy dreams.
The beds are this way.
Ithink I will sleep in my bottle.
Yeah.

What's the matter?
Hey, look at the wonderful clothes I found here in the closet.
They're full of this old stuff.
Anything wrong?
Anything wrong?
Oh, no, nothing's wrong.
I just came in to see how you were.
Heh.
My candle went out.
How's your room?
Oh, it's a little windy.
Yeah, uh, close your window.
It is closed.
Well, you know how these old houses are.
Yeah, windy.
Yeah.
How about this bed?
I'll bet you it's 300 years old.
Yeah, George slept there.
George?
King George III.
Yeah.
Well, I guess I better be getting back to the old wind Wind tunnel.
Yeah.
Well, uh, have a nice sleep.

Good night.

Who's there?
Is that you, Tony?
I don't like practical jokes.
In the middle of the night.
In an old English house.
All right.
All right, who is it?
Tony?
Tony!
Ahh!
Tony, Tony, Tony!
Roger!
Ahh!
Roger.
Roger.
Where are you?
Ah!
Are you all right?
Heh?
Oh!
Oh-oh, boy.
Listen, I don't wanna knock your 300-year-old house, but I think this place is haunted.
Yeah, yeah.
And I know who's haunting it.
Your Great Uncle Andrew?
No.
Your Great Aunt Andrew.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Yeah.
The bed, the chair.
Door Sure, she's trying to scare us.
That's what it is.
She?
Yeah, of course she is.
Let's go down and tell her she's not succeeding.
Uh, Jeannie, would you come out?
I'd like to, uh, talk to you, please.
Jeannie?
Oh!
Coming, master.
Yes, master.
Jeannie, what do you think you're doing?
Is anything wrong?
Is anything wrong?
How do you expect us to sleep with you carrying on like that?
Carrying on like what?
Carrying on I almost killed myself falling out of bed.
And breaking that mirror, Jeannie.
That was probably an antique.
All the furniture in here is antiques.
It can't be replaced not even for just for a joke.
But what mirror, what bed?
Don't pretend you weren't upstairs a minute ago.
I have been asleep.
Oh!
I've never been haunted before.
I don't think I like it.
Ah, there must be some logical explanation for what happened.
What do you think, Jeannie?
I think I would like to go home.
Come on, you don't believe in ghosts.
Well, of course I believe in ghosts.
Do you not believe in genies?
See.
If ghosts are good enough for Jeannie, they're good enough for me.
Now let's go.
Roger, what kind of a coward are you?
I don't know, what kind of cowards are there?
I'll get that.
No, no, let Smedley get it.
That's his job.
Yeah.
Smedley.
Smedley.
Yes?
Hey, wait a minute, wait.
Great Scott.
What on earth is going on here?
I beg your pardon.
You should.
What have you done to this house?
What do you mean what have I done to the house?
The place is an absolute wreck.
It was in perfect condition last week.
Well, it couldn't have been.
Look at these cobwebs.
They must have been here for years.
Who are you?
Never mind, never mind.
I'm Major Anthony Nelson.
The owner of the house.
Now, who are you?
I am Sir Widgin Willingham.
I am the owner of this house.
Oh!
But you cannot both own the house, sir.
Well, of course we can't both own it.
I own it, it says so right here.
Oh, it does say so.
That is his name.
Hey, who'd you buy this house from?
Edward Ashley.
Oh, well, I-I think there must be some misunderstanding.
Yeah, that's right.
It's called grand larceny.
I don't know what you're trying to pull, but you have 24 hours to get out of this house.
Ah!
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If you're still here when I return tomorrow, I'll put you into the hands of the police.
Hey, look.
Look at this thing.
Absolutely fell apart.
I'm going upstairs and pack.
No, we're staying here.
Look, let him have the house.
It's haunted.
He is right, master.
I can be packed in a blink.
Don't you see what's happening?
No, but I felt it when I fell out of bed last night.
Roger, that was Edward Ashley.
Did I hear my name?
Oh, Mr. Ashley, yes, we were just speaking of you, sir.
And how is the squire today?
Squeamish.
A squeamish squire.
Very good, very good.
Good one.
Roger, Jeannie Few things you haven't told us about this house, sir.
Well, I don't know what you mean.
What he means, sir, this place is haunted.
Haunted?
Nonsense.
Who told you that?
Oh, no one had to tell us.
Look.
Ahhh.
Algernon.
Algernon?
Algernon.
Oh.
Surely you don't believe in ghosts.
I do.
Well, surely now you'll be wanting to go back to America.
But there's no worry.
I'm quite prepared to take over the sale of the house, and I have the papers right here.
Thank you very much.
I've decided to stay.
Stay?
You Y-you mean, you're You're going to stay here?
Oh, I hope that is not what he means.
That's exactly what I mean, Jeannie.
Must we?
Yes, we must.
Major, that's the bravest thing I've ever heard.
But I can't possibly let you make this sacrifice.
What happened last night was nothing.
When Algernon really gets angry blah!
Grrr!
Aah!
Yaah!
Ahhh-ah-ah!
Oh, I dread to even think about it.
Thank you very much, but I'm staying.
Of course you're staying!
Surely you must stay.
It's your house.
It's your ghost.
Enjoy it while you can.
Thanks.
Well, I'm driving to London.
Anyone need a lift?
I think I will go visit my mother.
There will not nobody be going nowhere.
The bridge is washed away.
You'll all have to stay the night.
All six of us.
Ah!
I don't like it.
Supposing they catch on?
Shh!
They're not going to catch on.
We almost had them last night.
The other two are ready to quit already.
Now, that Major Nelson's got a very stubborn look about him.
Shh!
I'll take care of him.
Tonight, we give him the full treatment.
Now, have we got everything?
Flashlight, chains, bed sheets All right, have we got everything?
Flashlights, chains, bed sheet, right?
Yeah, what good is it gonna do?
I mean, how are you gonna scare a ghost?
It's not a ghost, Roger.
They're trying to scare us outta the house.
I got news for you.
I think they already have.
Just follow instructions.
Relax.
Yeah.
Ah.
How do I look?
Huh?
Hey!
By gum, you look ghastly.
Yeah, marvelous.
Come on.
How do I look?
Terrible.
Good, gonna beat them at their own game.

Yeah, but wait a minute.
Roger, be quiet.
That room is good.
Shh!
Smedley?
He's gone.
Wait, he's not there.
C-come on.
We'll find him.
Oh.
Come on, come on.
What kind of a balloon did you give me anyway?
Don't kill me.
I'm an American tourist.
Stop that, it's me.
Me who?
Me Tony.
Who?
Tony.
Tony, Tony.
Oh!
Am I glad to see you.
What's the matter with you?
Look at you.
What's the matter with me?
I fell through a trap door and I got stuck on those walls.
See?
This has gotta be scaring Jeannie to death.
You go check on her.
No, I can't.
Can't I stay with you?
Roger.
Yeah, yeah.
Here, this way.
Wait.
Okay, if you say so.
That way.
Master?
Ah!
Ah!
Major Nelson.
Ashley.
Well Well Well, who is in that sheet?
Well, if you don't know, it must be an old friend of mine.
Oh, you've got some pretty funny friends.
I've got some pretty funny lawyers.
What do you mean by that?
I'll tell you what I mean by that.
I've got a couple lawyers in the States who could make mincemeat out of you.
Well, you There's this thing called fraud.
I don't know what lawyers you got in this country, but we got a couple of lawyers Are you still here?
Ashley!
What's going on here?
I've been doing a little ghost breaking.
Ghost breaking?
Oh, I see through your little scheme.
You're trying to get me to sell you my house, aren't you?
Well, let me tell you, young man, that nothing would induce me to part with this house.
Do I make myself clear?
Will you tell him or shall I?
Uh You see, sir, there seems to be a little bit of a misunderstanding.
A little misunderstanding?
He tried to sell you my house.
It's not your house, it's my house.
It certainly is my house!
The whole house is my hou  This house is haunted.
Send me back my down payment.
It's your house.
It's your house.
Willingham, wait for me.
Oh, master.
Oh, thank heaven, you're safe.
Jeannie, you were marvelous.
Did you see him run outta here?
You were sensational.
I was?
Yeah.
Yeah, it almost fooled me.
What almost fooled you?
That invisible ghost thing.
Look at that.
Okay, all right, you can stop it now.
Stop what?
The thing you're doing there.

Jeannie!
I'm ready for breakfast.
Ah.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, master.
Beautiful.
How was your dinner party at At the Bellow" last night?
Ho-ho.
Wonderful, wonderful.
I wish I could have taken you.
I tell you what a cook.
Thank you.
She must have learned to cook in Paris.
Ooh, is she a A better cook than I am?
Mm.
Well, it's not the same.
She cooks all her own meals.
So she didn't You just you know, blink.
I see.
Remarkable woman, Mrs. Bellows.
She cooks all his dinners cleans his clothes irons his shirts.
Yeah, yeah, he's a very lucky man.
Why, I'm sorry if you have been suffering.
How did we get into this?
You attacked me.
No, I didn't attack you.
All I was doing is praising Mrs. Bellows.
That is what I said.
You attacked me.
I am sure that even if I were not a genie, I could do all these things better than she can.
I'm sure you could, Jeannie.
I'm sure you could.
But we'll never know, will we?
Morning.
Good morning, Tony.
Hi, Roge.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, Major Healey.
Would you care for some breakfast?
No, thank you.
I'm still stuffed from last night.
That meal was something, wasn't it?
Fair.
Fair?
That was one of the greatest meals I ever had in my whole life.
What a housekeeper.
Mrs. Bellows We're a little late.
We better get to the office.
Wait, it's not that late.
Wait a minute, what do you mean it's late?
Very well then.
If that is what he wants, that is what he is going to get.
It is war.
No.
No, no.
And you have summoned Haji here for this?
Oh, yes, great Haji.
In all my years as master of the genies, I've never heard anything like it.
You wish me to take away your magic powers?
Oh, please.
It is the last request I will make of you.
If I take away your powers, it'll be the last request you'll be able to make.
You'll be like everyone else, a mere mortal.
Yes.
That is exactly what I wish to be.
Just like everyone else.
Oh, the kids today have no appreciation.
Oh, please.
This is very important to me.
I shall never understand this younger generation.
Well, as long as I am a genie, my My master has no respect for me.
He takes me for granted.
Then you must do more for him.
The more I do for him, the more he takes me for granted.
Oh?
But let another woman cook or clean or sew for him, and he never stops talking about it.
Heh.
You would think they were performing miracles.
And you believe that if you did these things without magic powers, for him, it will impress him.
Oh, I know it will.
I should never have taken on this job.
I think I'm getting an ulcer.
Thank you.
What is it?
Chicken soup.
Ah.
You remembered.
Delicious.
Delicious.
What you're asking is against the rules, you know.
But you will do it?
Mm.
Yes.
Oh, thank you, Haji.
For one week.
One week?
I will not tolerate my genies turning into a bunch of Into a bunch of hippies.
But you will do it?
One moment.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.
Now   Your powers are gone.
Good luck.
Oh, thank you, Haji.
Thank you.
Oh.
Oh!
My master is in for the most wonderful surprise.
Brilliant.
You're the only one on the base who could've done that.
I don't know what's gotten into Jeannie.
Every time I open my mouth, she starts an argument.
That's not like her.
She generally has a great disposition.
Yeah.
Unless she gets mad, then look out.
I know.
Oh, you must have said something to her.
All I did was tell her what a wonderful cook Amanda Bellows was.
Major Nelson, you're very sweet.
Mrs. Bellows.
Hello.
Please.
Sit down.
Oh, thank you.
But now, don't let me interrupt you gentlemen.
You were saying what a great cook I am?
Oh, Amanda.
Darling, don't be jealous.
I'm sure they say marvelous things behind your back too.
I'll say.
Major, who were you telling about my cooking?
Who?
Whom.
Yes, you said she got angry and started an argument.
Oh, my housekeeper, Jeannie.
Oh, I didn't know you had a housekeeper.
She's new.
Brand new.
And she can't cook?
Well Let's say she can't cook the way you do.
I would say that's a fair statement.
Well, perhaps you are asking too much from her.
After all, women like Amanda don't come along every day.
Oh, darling.
Women like his housekeeper don't come along every day either.
Well Come along, Amanda.
We'll just leave you to your work.
Oh, yes, I just wanted to say hello.
I wanted to thank you for a wonderful evening.
It's nothing at all.
Thank you for coming.
Okay, goodbye.
Oh, Dr. Bellows, I hope I didn't go too far with those party tricks at your house the other night.
Oh, no.
The other guests thought you were very entertaining.
Well, I always try to have fun.
You forgot your socks.
Oh.
Thank you, sir.
They're mine.
I was wondering what I did with these.
Jeannie.
Hello?
Hey!
Uh!
Oh!
Jeannie!
Hey Jeannie, what's going on here anyhow?
Mm.
Sorry, master.
I'm sorry.
I burned my finger.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
I'm sorry.
I burned my finger.
Oh, let me see.
Oh, that is all right.
It's fine.
Well, it's not the only thing you've burned.
Look at this.
Oh, that is terrible.
Just as I was getting the hang of it.
Well, you know I always send out my own shirts.
From now on, I am going to do them for you.
I don't think I can afford you.
Oh.
I will fix that.
What do I smell, besides this, that's burning?
Hm?
My dinner.
Dinner?
You're cooking dinner by hand?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!
Jeannie!
What is going on here?
Are you all right, master?
Look, Jeannie, I've had a very hard day.
A very hard day.
Now, I want all this stuff out of here.
The ironing board in the living room, and all of this, and Whatever that is.
I'm gonna count to three.
I want it gone, you understand?
One, two, three.
They're still here, you see.
All of this, it's still here.
All of this.
Master?
Yes?
I have the most wonderful news for you.
TONY : You gotta be kidding.
Oh, please, master.
I will learn how to do everything.
You will be surprised.
Well, you've lost your powers now.
I don't really have a choice, do I?
Oh, thank you, master.
I will be the best housewife in the whole world.
You will see.
Could I make a suggestion?
Certainly, master.
Don't starch the pajamas.
But they are bigger now.
Don't.
Oh.
Good night.
Good night, master.
Oh, hi, Tony.
I was just talking to Doc Have you outgrown all your uniforms?
It's a new style.
Uh, mini-sleeves.
Mini-sleeves.
They're very chic.
Jeannie's at it again, huh?
She washed it.
That's carrying things too far.
Yeah.
Oh, Major Nelson.
I, um just wanna go over the details of this Major, what are you wearing?
Well, I've got work to do, sir.
Excuse me.
Ahem.
It shrunk, sir.
My other uniforms are in the cleaners.
Well, it looks terrible.
Take that jacket off.
You look like Little Major Fauntleroy.
I-I'd rather not.
Well.
Don't stand on formality.
This is your office.
Take it off.
If you say so, sir.
Oh.
That is three.
Hm.
Hello?
Oh!
Oh, wow.
Is Major Nelson home?
Hello?
Hello?
Well, I've heard of shy, but this is ridiculous.
Oh, you must be Jeannie.
You have heard of me?
Oh, yes, of course.
Major Nelson told me all about you.
I'm Amanda Bellows.
Oh, I know.
My master has told me all about you.
Oh, I'm glad that he told Your master?
Well, that is what I call him.
Oh.
I baked this for him.
Oh.
He will be so pleased.
He does not think I am a very good cook.
He does not think I am a very good housewife either.
Housewife?
Oh.
You and Major Nel And I want to be the best housewife in the whole world.
And he never said a word.
He didn't bring you to dinner last night.
Oh, no.
My master never takes me out with him.
He said it would be too embarrassing if people knew about me.
He did, did he?
Mm-hm.
But now that he has told you about me, it is all right.
He will be pleased that we have met.
Uh.
Pleased isn't the word for it.
Now, let me get this straight.
Honey, didn't you have any idea what you were getting involved in?
Well Perhaps I was a little too hasty.
This morning, I wanted to go to the grocery store, and I didn't have anything to wear.
You didn't have anything to wear?
Do you mean to tell me that this is the only thing you have?
Doesn't he buy you any dresses?
Oh, no.
My master has never bought me any clothes.
I will make some coffee.
Won't you please sit down.
I Oh.
Oh, dear.
I've not made up my bed yet.
You sleep on the couch?
Well, yes, uh That does it.
Ha!
Boy, that does it.
Listen, I am going to get you out of this mess if it's the last thing I ever do.
Oh, thank you.
If I could just learn how to clean the house.
Honey, you don't need a clean house.
What you need is a divorce!
Major Nelson marry?
Oh, really, Amanda, I don't believe it.
You haven't heard anything.
Well, he certainly would have told me if he were married.
Darling, you don't know a thing about the real Major Nelson.
I know that man's psyche like the back of my own hand.
How would you describe him, psychiatric-wise?
Anthony Nelson is a very capable young man.
Sensitive, generous Ha!
Ha?
Major Nelson is a sadistic, penny-pinching miser.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about a man who treats his wife like a slave.
And dresses her the same way.
You keep talking about Major Nelson's wife.
Where is she?
Upstairs.
Under my protection.
Upstairs?
Under your protection?
Uh, wait, darling.
I am going to tell you about the real psyche behind the psyche of Major Nelson.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
I got a surprise Wonder what this place was like before she started cleaning it up.
I got a surprise for you, Jeannie.
Hey, where are you?
I got a "She's left you, you louse".
"You louse"?
She's left me?
Wait!
I've heard of separate bedrooms.
But separate couch?
Check.
Checkmate.
Alfred, it's unbelievable.
I helped her pack, darling.
And she She doesn't even own a pair of stockings.
And he keeps her running around the house in some flimsy Arabian Night thing.
You know, so she can't even go out.
She's practically a prisoner.
Do you know what this means?
What?
I'm gonna have to do a whole new profile chart on him.
Alfred, what about that poor girl upstairs?
Yes.
We must do something.
Keeping her in slavery   That's the classic Zimmerman pattern.
A frustrated, infantile, sadistic Alfred, this isn't a lecture.
This is real life.
I'm sorry, my dear.
Well, what are we gonna do?
I'm going to have a little talk with Major Nelson.
Cocoa Beach Hotel?
Yes.
Uh, I wonder if a young lady's checked in there in the last hour or so.
Jeannie.
Well, she could have used any last name.
She's a blond, and she was wearing kind of a pink harem costume.
Hello?
Hello?
Yes?
Oh!
Good evening, Dr. Bellows.
Is it?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
As a matter of fact, it's quite nice.
Uh, you seem, uh, agitated.
Is anything wrong?
Uh Oh, no.
No, no, nothing Well, my housekeeper is missing, as you can see.
I was just trying to locate her.
And that's what I came here to discuss.
What?
My housekeeper?
If that's what you wish to call her.
You see, major, I know all about her.
Y-you do?
I What I mean is, there's nothing to know.
She's just your ordinary everyday housekeeper.
In a pink harem costume?
Pink harem You've seen her.
Where is she, Dr. Bellows?
I mean, she shouldn't run around loose.
You have no idea what kind of trouble she can get in.
She's perfectly safe, major.
She's staying at my house until Mrs. Bellows can arrange for the divorce.
Divorce?
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
It's me.
Louse.
Come on, I've come to take you out of here.
You Would you?
Come on.
I wanna take you home.
Now, don't you pretend to be asleep, young lady.
Come on.
All right.
I'll get you out of here even if I have to carry you out.
Mm.
Shh!
Good evening, Dr. Bellows.
What are you doing?
I'm taking her home.
Good evening, Mrs. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows, if I could just talk to Jeannie just for a minute No, major.
You've done enough to that poor girl.
Uh, has she complained?
That poor innocent child doesn't even know how badly you've treated her.
That poor innocent child?
Do you happen to know how old she is?
No.
How old is she?
Well, her age has nothing to do with it.
You're not ready for marriage, Major Nelson.
I know I'm not.
I never said I was, sir.
Do you know what you are ready for, major?
No, sir.
In-depth analysis.
Starting tomorrow morning, Sir, I don't need in-depth analysis.
All I need is A whip and chain.
I'll handle this, Amanda.
You should be arrested.
Good night, major.
Good night, sir.
Mrs. Bellows.
It shatters the imagination to think what some women will put up with.
Yes.
What's gonna happen to him now, Alfred?
Well, first, I'm gonna straighten him out.
And then I'm gonna have him transferred out of NASA.
Oh, no.
Oh.
My poor master.
Oh, I cannot let them transfer him out of NASA.
Uh, because if they do he will kill me.
Haji.
Haji.
Oh.
Oh, this is terrible.
This time, I have truly done it.
Here we are.
Here we are.
Sit down, darling.
Uh, Jeannie, this is Mr. Murdock.
This is a sad day for all of us.
Oh, yes.
You have nothing to fear, my dear.
I want you to think of me as a father figure.
Someone to turn to in this time of great sorrow.
Is he an undertaker?
Oh.
Oh, no, dear.
No, no, no.
He's your divorce lawyer.
M-m My divorce lawyer?
I know it hurts now.
But believe me in a few weeks, you'll be laughing.
I have hundreds of satisfied clients.
They come to me in shackles.
They leave on soaring wings.
Mr. Murdock, I cannot divorce Major Nelson.
Why not?
Because we are not She's terrified of him.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, I am not terrified of him.
He is the most wonderful master in the whole world.
Master?
What did I tell you?
Oh, this is gonna be a beauty.
Please do not do anything that will harm Major Nelson.
Oh, relax, Jeannie, dear.
Well, It's true you won't have Major Nelson anymore.
But you'll have something much better.
Community property.
I do not want this community property.
He's brainwashed her.
Well the grounds for divorce surely won't be a problem.
Uh He, uh, kept you a slave.
He never took you out.
Gave you no allowance.
No clothes to speak of.
He forced you to sleep on the couch while he slept in a luxurious bedroom.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
It was not that way at all.
There's something that we don't know about?
Yes.
Well, tell us.
Well, I-if I tell you the whole truth will it help Major Nelson?
Well, let's put it this way, Jeannie.
It can't do him any more harm.
Then I will tell you.
The reason I slept on the couch was because I could not get into my bottle.
I missed something.
Oh.
You see, I am a genie.
Major Nelson picked me up on a desert island.
Well, he He found me in this bottle where a wicked djinn had put me.
Well, it is true he opened my bottle, but it is not fair to say that he mistreated me.
Major Nelson is the most wonderful master I have ever had.
Well, everything would have been fine if I had not called on Haji.
Haji?
The chief of all the genies.
That Haji.
He took away all my powers.
So that is why I could not get into my bottle to sleep.
And the reason there are no clothes in the house is because this is what all genies wear.
Did I forget something?
No.
But there is something she forgot to tell me.
You're a fruitcake.
I can't apologize enough, Major Nelson, for the terrible mistake we've made.
That's all right, sir.
It could happen to anyone.
What you must have had to put up with.
You'll never know.
It was a nightmare.
Oh, you poor thing.
Uh Where is she now?
She went to her mother's.
I suppose you'll be getting an annulment.
I suppose so.
Oh.
If there's anything I can do The wounds will heal.
Of course.
Uh  Major, come to dinner tomorrow night.
I'll cook my specialty, duck with orange sauce.
I'd love to.
Oh, good.
Good.
We'll see you tomorrow.
Yes.
Of course.
Good night, major.
Good night, sir.
Good night.
You are not going to eat that woman's terrible cooking again.
Oh, yes, I am.
It's great cooking.
Great.
And there's nothing you can do about it, because you lost your powers, remember?
My powers came back an hour ago.
Mm.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}

You're like some lovely, untouchable statue.
Oh, is that not beautiful?

I never knew what a beating heart was for.
Ooh, I cannot bear it.
Well, look, how about a little breakfast?
What do you say?
Jeannie, this is not exactly what I had in mind.
Read your paper, master.
What?
I've treasured every second we've been together.

These roses are for you, my darling.
One for every hour that I've spent with you.

They are from Ronald.
Georgia, you never looked more beautiful.

What am I doing?
I am givin' up women.
Well, I I thought you and Georgia had something Don't mention Georgia.
Well, weren't you sort of engaged?
She was sort of engaged.
Only I found out it was with another guy.
Oh.
I'm sorry to hear about that.
Yeah, well, it opened my eyes.
Boy, all women are unfaithful.
Ruth, Alice, Faye, all of them.
They're rotten to the core.
Past few bad experiences, that's You bet they're all bad, all of 'em.
No, not all of 'em.
All of them.
Well, what about Jeannie?
What about her?
Now, Jeannie'd never be interested in another man.
How about a bet on that?
What do you mean?
What do I mean?
I'm gonna open your eyes, that's what I'm gonna do.
I bet if the right guy comes along, Jeannie'll drop you so fast your head'll swim.
You don't even know what you're talking about.
Well, fifty dollars says I do.
I don't wanna take your money.
Fifty dollars.
Roge, I don't bet on a thing like that.
I'll bet you that all women are bad, including Jeannie.
All right.
All right.
I'm gonna take your bet.
Okay.
I'm gonna teach you something about women.
All right, it's a bet, huh?
A bet.
All right, who's the guy?

No, I'm betting that I can't take Jeannie away from myself.
Major Nelson's residence.
Hello, Jeannie?
Master, darling.
Is there anything I can do for you?
No, no, no.
I just wanted to ask you to come down and have lunch at the base with me today.
Oh!
You're inviting me to come to the base?
Yeah, that's right.
But you always tell me to stay away Well, I've changed my mind.
Why don't you put on your prettiest dress and meet me here at 1:00, okay?
Oh, yes, darling master, I will be there.
Good, good.
I'll see you then.
Goodbye.
Oh.
Oh, I am sorry.
I am looking for Major Nelson.
Yes.
As a matter of fact, so was I. Do come in.
Come, come, come.
Major Nelson was called away rather suddenly.
Won't you sit down, please?
Oh, yes.
Now, I'm afraid he won't be back for the rest of the afternoon.
Oh, dear, and we were to have had lunch.
Oh.
Forgive me, Geoffrey Tiff in-Smythe at your service, ma'am.
I am Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jolly nice name, that.
Are you a friend of Major Nelson's?
No, no, actually.
I've just flown in from London this morning.
Oh, you are English?
Yes, quite, quite.
Uh, I'm in the British Army Medical Corps.
Oh, how exciting.
No, not really.
Look here, since your Major Nelson stood you up, as you Americans say, perhaps you would have a spot of lunch with me.
That is unless you're one of those girls that doesn't make dates with strange men?
Oh, no, I I don't.
Oh, jolly good for you.
But in this case I would make an exception.
You would?
Splendid, splendid.
I will just leave a note for Major Nelson.
Yes, poor chap.
What?
Oh, good idea, good idea.
Perhaps he can join us later.
I doubt it.
No, no, no.
Dr. Bellows.
Yes.
I don't believe we've met.
I know you by your reputation, of course.
Do you?
What's your name?
Geoffrey Tiff in-Smythe.
I'm here on detached service from London.
You're a doctor?
Yes, yes, quite.
Of course, you're with the group of English psychiatrists who are visiting NASA.
Well, as a matter of fact I'm delighted to meet you.
I'd like to discuss that new breakthrough you chaps have been working on.
Eh, breakthrough?
The chemotherapy breakthrough in schizophrenia.
Oh, yes, that breakthrough.
How silly of me.
Of course.
Let's go to my office.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
I'm busy at the moment.
But we have so much to talk about.
Yes, yes, of course we do.
If you'll excuse me for one moment, I'll be right back.
Certainly.
Are we ready for lunch?
Oh, uh, Jeannie, I'm dreadfully sorry.
Something important has come up.
I'm afraid I won't be able to have lunch with you.
Oh, dear.
I did so want to get to know you better.
And I to know you.
Look here, perhaps we can have dinner together tonight?
Oh, I would love that.
You sure you're not busy or anything?
Nothing I cannot get out of.
Oh, wizard.
Uh, where shall we meet?
Why do you not pick me up at my house?
At your house?
Mm-hmm.
It is 811 Palm.
You live there alone?
No, I I live with an old uncle.
An old uncle?
Yes, he's a darling old thing.
Yes, how marvelous for you.
Dr. Tiff in-Smythe.
Yes, I'll be right there, sir.
I'll pick you up then at 7:30, huh?
Cheery-bye.
Cheery-bye.
Oh.
I can't tell you what a stroke of luck this is for me, doctor.
I found I have a rather full schedule for this afternoon.
I was You must cancel everything.
I don't intend to let you out of my sight.
Ha, ha, ha.
Good show.
Shall we go?
Yes, of course.
And I was the happiest man alive until Major Nelson came on this base.
You have no idea what he's done to my life, doctor.
Dr. Bellows, I really don't think that I'm the one I feel so much better finally being able to talk to someone about him.
Yes, of course you do.
However, may I say again that I don't think I'm the one?
I feel I can tell you everything because in a day or two, you'll be gone.
And I won't have to look you in the eye every morning.
But may I say again that?
He can see through walls.
It's most important for an astronaut to have good vision.
Thick walls.
"Thick walls".
Not so long ago, he was in Cocoa Beach and Paris.
Well, jet pilots do get around nowadays, you know.
Heh.
At the same time.
"At the same time".
You don't think I'm disturbed, do you, doctor?
Oh, no, no, of course not, Dr. Bellows.
Might I make just one, tiny suggestion, however?
Oh, please do.
Uh, Dr. Freud had a patient with a problem similar to the one you've described.
Dr. Freud?
He did?
Yes.
Yes, this patient thought Thought he saw an elephant in his living room.
So did Major Nelson.
As a matter of fact, I saw them too.
Did you?
So did Dr. Freud.
Really?
Yeah.
Well how did Dr. Freud handle it?
Well He, um He gave his patient free rein.
You see, the most important thing to do in a case like this is not to disturb the patient.
They are often creative, intelligent people, and they mustn't be inhibited.
Why, I never thought of it that way.
Think of it.
Think of it.
Hello, master.
Hello, how are you, Jeannie?
You are home early.
Oh, yes, yes.
I just came home to pick up the papers.
I'm gonna be working late at the base tonight.
Oh.
Heh.
Well, that is too bad.
Oh, I'm I'm sorry I stood you up for lunch.
Lunch?
Oh, oh, yes.
You, uh You weren't bored or anything, were you?
Oh, no, not at all.
I like the people at NASA.
Good, good.
Meet anybody special?
Special?
Mm.
No.
You didn't?
Should I have?
No.
What are you gonna be doing while I'm at work tonight?
Oh, well, I I have not been able to make up my mind.
I-I may just stay home and read.
Oh, look, a book, that's a good idea.
On the other hand, I may go out with an old uncle of mine who is in town.
An old uncle?
Mm-hmm.
Old Uncle Geoffrey.
Oh.
Good evening, Jeannie.
Geoffrey, how nice to see you again.
Please, do come in.
Thank you, thank you.
Uh Is your uncle at home?
No.
We are all alone.
Oh, ho, ho.
Splendid, splendid.
Do you like the house?
Oh, yes, yes, wizard, wizard.
Have you lived here long?
Oh, yes.
I was born here.
Were you?
Are you expecting someone?
Oh, no.
Oh, perhaps it is someone for my poor old uncle.
Heh.
Hi, Jeannie.
Oh, Major Healey.
Oh, I didn't know you redecorated.
Well Where's Tony?
Oh, uh, Major Nelson had to work late tonight.
Oh, I didn't know that.
I think it was unexpected.
Why are we whispering?
Oh, I didn't know you had company.
Uh, hello, I'm, uh, Major Healey.
Oh, hello.
Dr. Geoffrey Tiff in-Smythe.
Oh, you're a doctor.
He's a doctor.
You, uh?
You two known each other long?
Well Oh, well, not long, but we are getting to know each other much better.
You just made me a rich man.
I beg your pardon?
Oh, it's nothing.
Just a little bet with a friend of mine.
What kind of bet?
Well, I Good heavens, look at the time.
We're gonna miss our reservation.
Oh, reserv Are you two going out?
Oh, yes.
Well, not exactly.
I love dining out.
Oh, I love your loving dining out with him.
I will go get my bag.
Yes, do that.
Oh, wait till I tell my friend about them going out.
My foot.
Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry.
Oh, that's okay, doc.
While you're here, would you mind looking at this?
Hmm?
Oh, yes.
Stay off it for a week.
I sure it will be better.
Aah!
Make that two weeks.
Shall we?
I won the bet.
I lost my foot, but I won the bet.
Hi.
Good morning.
Oh, hi, Roge.
Well, would you like to pay me in cash or a check?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the bet you lost last night.
Are you serious?
I've never been more serious in my life.
Come on, pay up.
Roge, that was me.
What was you?
You're You're kidding.
You really don't know who Dr. Tiff in-Smythe is?
No, who is he?
He's me.
Who's you?
Who's what?
Who's you?
Roger, I'm me, and you're you.
That's what makes the world go around, isn't it, Dr. Bellows?
I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
He was just saying  Oh!
My broken foot.
Sorry, sorry.
Take a look at this when you get a chance, would you, major?
Of course, sir.
Of course.
There's, uh, no rush.
I want you to take your time.
Oh, thank you.
I I don't want you to feel under any pressure.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I want you to feel free, relaxed.
Uh, uninhibited.
I want you to have a A free rein.
Well, that's very kind of you, sir.
I think you're gonna find things a little different around here, Major Nelson.
I certainly hope so.
I mean, good, good.
Yes.
Well, uh, carry on, gentlemen.
Thank you, sir.
Well, if you'll just give me my $50, I'll be running along.
Roge, you You did not win that bet.
The man's always the last one to know, isn't he?
Well, I hate to be the one to break this to you, but, uh, Jeannie went dining last night with a famous British doctor.
Dr. Tiff in-Smythe.
You You mean, you know about it?
He's an old friend of the family.
Yeah, well, I had a fiancÃ©e who said that once, and she wound up marrying the guy.
Oh, don't worry about Jeannie.
She's not gonna marry anybody.
As a matter of fact, she has another date with that guy tonight, and, uh, I think she's gonna say goodbye to him.
Another $50 says she doesn't.
You're on.
Okay.
Hey, wait a minute.
How am I gonna know if I win or not?
Well, you can either take my word for it, or you can come to the house and see for yourself.
I'll take your word for it.
Good.
And come to your house and see for myself.
Oh, yes, a most amusing evening.
Well Well, here we are.
It has been a wonderful evening, Geoffrey.
Oh, you're most flattering.
I'm sure you go out quite often.
Oh, no, I very seldom go out to restaurants.
And not with anyone like you.
I'm afraid this is goodbye.
Goodbye?
Yes, I must return to London quite soon.
Oh.
Well I cannot let you go now.
Oh, but, uh Don't be absurd.
You must let me go.
I will go to England.
You'll come to England?
Well, I will go there if you're going to be there.
Oh, marvelous, marvelous.
That's That's wonderful.
Well, good night.
Good night.
Mm.
Mmm.
Well Yes?
Well, it's jolly nice, um, getting to know a person, isn't it?
I mean, really knowing the person.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
Yes.
Well, good night.

Adorable.
Oh, I wish you could have a master like him.
Oh, well, darling, I'm working on it.

All you have to do is sprinkle a few drops on your Major Nelson and he will love you madly forever.
Oh, that is wonderful.
I am going to do it right away.
Yes, I knew I could count on you.
What is that?
Oh, darling, if you love Major Nelson, you'll certainly want to hate his enemies, won't you?
I suppose so.
Well, you're a terrible hater, darling.
This will help you.
Heh.
All you have to do is sprinkle a few drops from the blue flask on his enemies, and you'll be a marvelous hater.
Uh, oh Oh, one word of warning, pet.

Huh?
Is something bothering you?
Uh, no.
No.
I'm fine.

It's just a little chilly in here.
Chilly?
This is July.

Perhaps you've got a fever.
No, I'm fine.
Fine, thank you.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.
Um, yes.
Now, um, uh, to continue, gentlemen.
We were Major Nelson, what happened to your uniform?
Uh Oh Oh, this.
Yes, well No, no, no.
No, never mind.
Don't tell me.
Now, as I was saying, in our preliminary exploratory expeditions, we managed to, uh, capture particles of so-called, uh, space dust in order to make Major Nelson?
Yeah?
I must really ask you to pay attention.
Oh, I I'm I'm paying attention, sir.
Could you turn up the heat, please?
Turn Turn up Yeah.
Turn up the heat.
Whoo!
It must be at least 90 in here.
Yeah.
Are you sure you're all right?
Your face looks awfully red.
I-I'm bursting with health.
Oh, Major Nelson?
Yeah?
I don't know how to tell you this, but, uh I'm afraid you're suffering from frostbite.
Frost?
Frostbite?
Yes.
Uh, no, no.

There.
That should do it.
Thank you, sir.
If that will be all, I'll be running along now.
Not until I get an explanation, major.
An explanation, sir?
Yes.
Frostbite in Cocoa Beach in July.
Doesn't that strike even you as a little peculiar?
It's a part of, uh, Operation Deep Freeze, sir.
Operation Deep Freeze?
Yes, sir, it's a secret project Roger and I are working on to prepare us for the cold nights on the dark side of the moon.
Well, why wasn't I told of this?
They shouldn't be doing medical experiments on you without my approval.
It came up rather suddenly, sir.
General Arland got the idea in the middle of the night and you weren't available.
But they still have no right to go on General Arland?
Yes.
Oh, I see.
If you'll excuse me, sir, I have to see Major Healey.
Yes.
Roge.
Shh!
One his and one hers.
Towels?
Yachts.
Ah, look at that.
A chateau in the Alps, diamond mine, three model agencies.
A chain of banks.
This afternoon I'm going to get down to my more important list.
That's not gonna make you happy, Roge.
I know money can't buy happiness.
But I'll just suffer with these things till the real thing comes along.
Um, could I ask you a favor?
All right, I'll tell you what I'll do.
I'll, uh, give you a yacht and one model agency.
I don't want those things.
How about a chateau and a diamond mine?
I'd like to talk to Jeannie.
Boy, you're really asking for it.
I'll tell you what.
I'll give you one hour.
Then maybe I can give you a I I just want to say goodbye to her, Roger.
I I don't want her to hate me.
All right.
I'll show you I'm as sentimental as the next man.
Oh, thanks, Roge.
Jeannie!
Oh, you called.
Oh, my beloved.
Uh, ahem, dear, uh, Tony Tony would like to talk to you.
Oh, please do not make me talk to him.
Oh, I know how awful it's been being his genie, but you You just give him a little short talk, okay?
I'll be back in a few minutes.
Make it short, huh?
Okay.
Uh, Jeannie Do not say my name or I will not be able to control myself.
All right.
Look, I can understand you wanting another master, uh, getting tired of me, and But I don't understand why you hate me.
You are not deceiving me.
You are an evil and cunning devil.
Evil and cunning?
Uh, but this morning I was adorable.
Uh, look, Jeannie, I don't want you to hate me.
Ooh!
Please.
Now, please.
Jeannie?
Now, I I  Thank you, sergeant.
Just put those papers on my desk.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, I, uh I wonder if you would?
You mind telling me what you're doing?
Ice?
Bless you, darling.
Huh?
What are you doing here?
Oh!
Well, I came to nurse you, darling, so that you can get better and I can teach you how to swing in 73 different languages.
Oh, you're going to be the best-known playboy in the whole world.
No, no.
I think we'll start in Rio.
We're not gonna start anyplace.
I I'm an astronaut.
I'm no playboy.
Oh, don't be a drag, darling.
You're going to have to give all that up.
I hope you can samba.
Oh, dear, we're going to have to stop that nonsense.
Look, if you'll just go away and leave me alone Oh, there.
That's better.
Kiss me, Tony, baby.
Uh, I'm sorry, lady.
I I've got work to do.
I can't wait to start training you.
Training me?
Yes, darling.
How you ever stood that square sister of mine, I'll never know.
She and Major Healey deserve one another.
Say, did you arrange for her to fall in love with Major Healey and start hating me?
Ah, don't bother to thank me, darling.
Perhaps we'll go to Marienbad.
It's very chic this time of year.
How'd you do it, hm?
Or Gstaad.
Do you like to ski, darling?
How did you get Jeannie to hate me?
Heh.
It was terribly simple.
All I did was switch lotions.
Isn't that marvelous?
Oh, you switched the lotions.
Uh-huh.
Marvelous.
She doesn't suspect a thing.
No, but she's not terribly bright, you know.
You're a lot smarter than she is.
Oh, I know, I know.
Isn't it heaven?
Yeah, I got to hand it to you, all right.
Oh, I'm the greatest.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I still don't understand how you were able to switch the flasks without Jeannie getting suspicious.
Oh, well, you see, darling, I simply told her that the white flask had the love lotion and the blue flask had the hate lotion.
And then I changed them.
Isn't that marvelous?
Marvelous.
I'm going to arrange for you to go without sleep.
I want you to spend figuring out ways to please me.
Well, I thought you were the genie and I was the master.
Oh, well, of course, darling.
But I run a tight ship.
You'll see.
You'll see.
But I hope you don't mind if I run out to the office and clean up a few things before I resign.
Oh, well, I don't know why you want to bother with all that drivel, but, uh, say, "Pretty please".
Pretty please.
Oh, this is going to be lovely!
Yes.
All right, run along, pet.
But be back here by 6:00.
And don't be late because if I lose my temper, you'll just hate yourself.
I'll be back.

I do not understand what happened.
This is what happened, Jeannie.
But that is my birthday present from my sister.
The white bottle is to make me love you better, and the blue bottle is to make me hate your enemies.

Your sister switched the flasks.

{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
"NASA announced that women applicants "will be interviewed today for the new space program "that will send an American man-and-woman team of astronauts as the first couple on the moon".
Why did you not tell me that you were going to the moon with a woman?
Slipped my mind.
Well, I hope you have a very enjoyable dinner with your lady astronaut.
Uh, do you really wanna know why I didn't tell you?
No.
No?
Mm-mm.
What is it?
Oh, well, I'm trying to get out of the project.
Are you really?
Yeah.
Why?
Well, who wants to go to the moon with a female Louis Pasteur?
Oh, I remember Professor Pasteur.
He had a darling beard.
Yeah.
Have you ever seen any of these lady scientists?
Forget it.
Would you like me to help you get out of the project, master?
No, no.
I'll handle it myself, thank you.
Thank you.
Have a good day.
Oh.
Oh, sister, you surprised me.
You surprise me even more, darling.
Falling for that line about a female Louis Pasteur.
What do you mean?
Sweetie pie, the day of the horn-rimmed glasses, long tweed skirt and flat shoes is over.
Nowadays, they wear minismocks.
Oh.
In a laboratory?
Well, that's why so many labs have blown up.
The men scientists keep dropping their test tubes.
You mean to say my master will be living on the moon with a beautiful girl?
Mm-hm.
Well, what will I do?
Leave everything to your big sister.
I'll make sure your master doesn't get off that launch pad with another woman.
Would you do that for me?
Darling, have I ever let you down?
No.
It occurs to me, gentlemen, that your anxieties over this mission are predicated on the fact that the applicants will turn out to be dull, drab, intellectual females.
Well, sir, based on my past experience Well, now, major, let me assure you that the woman-scientist image has changed.
The day of the horn-rimmed glasses, the long tweed skirt, and the flat shoes is over.
Uh, honestly, sir, based on my experience, I really can't agree with you there.
Oh, uh, send in the first applicant, will you, please?
Dr. Bellows, I think that this person ought to be trained.
You'll see.
In the same procedures we are.
Doctor Bellows?
Yes.
I'm Professor Henrietta Swanson.
Oh, how do you do, professor?
How do you do?
Uh, this is Major Nelson.
Major Nelson.
How do you do?
And Major Healey.
How do you do, Major Healey?
I see by your application that you're teaching, uh, nuclear physics at Carver College.
Yes, that's right.
Good, may I take your coat?
Hey, I'll take it.
I'll take it.
Oh.
Would you mind telling me the address of Carver College?
Well, you see, on my lunch hour, I moonlight as a cocktail waitress.
Why don't I take the professor to the lunar mock-up and show her the base operation.
Uh, let's not be premature, major.
Uh, I'm afraid I have to get back to the restaurant.
Well, I haven't eaten yet.
I'll drive you.
Major Healey, remember we have another applicant to screen.
Thank you very much, Professor Swanson.
Thank you.
We'll let you know.
Professor Swanson, is that?
We'll let you know.
Thank you.
We'll let you know.
Thank you very much.
Don't get cold.
Nuclear physicist, eh?
I don't think we need to look any further, sir.
I think that this woman probably needs Now, let me remind you that we need two women, major.
One for the backup team.
I wonder what yours is going to look like?
Excuse me.
I'm Dr. Rita Walters.
You must be Dr. Bellows.
Yes, how do you do, doctor?
Oh, excuse me, this is Major Nelson.
How do you do, Dr. Walters?
And, uh, Major Healey.
Hello.
Well, you certainly come well-qualified.
Uh, B.A., B.S., M.A., PhD.
And I see by records that you spent a great deal of time in the Middle East.
That's right, doctor.
I was very intrigued by your hobbies.
Oh, really?
What are they?
Oh carpet-making and flying.
Now, before we make the final pairings of teams in this project, we'll conduct a series of tests.
Since the man and woman who'll land on the moon will be totally isolated from the rest of the universe, it is extremely important that they be compatible.
I don't think there's any question about the professor and I being compatible, sir.
She moonlights as a cocktail waitress and, uh, I moonlight in cocktail lounges.
The computer will make the proper decision, Major Healey.
I'm counting on it.
We all are.
Now, then, these are very simple questions, and I'll ask that you make your response on the cards in front of you.
First question.
If, uh, you were furnishing a house, what style would you use?
Early American, contemporary, Danish modern or French provincial.
Major Healey.
Have you answered that question?
Good.
Second question.
Now, what is your favorite dog?
German shepherd, French poodle, English sheepdog or Mexican Chihuahua?
No humming.
Oh, ladies and gentlemen, the results are now coming through.
Oh, boy, are we going to have a lot of fun on the moon.
Uh, ask the machine what time we leave, huh?
Now, uh, as for the type of furnishing, Professor Swanson, you answered early American.
And Major Healey, you answered French provincial.
Wait a minute.
I didn't hum French provincial.
I love early American.
I am an early American.
Tell them, don't I have an old spinning wheel in the parlor?
From these cards, it would appear that.
Major Nelson and Professor Swanson are the more compatible team.
The final selection will be made after the physical fitness test.
A physical fitness test?
Woman applicant who demonstrates the best coordination and physical fitness will be on your number one team, Major Nelson.
And the other will be on the backup team with Major Healey.
Dr. Bellows, that's unfair.
Oh?
Well, you see, I was the national women's gymnastic champion in college.
And what about you, Dr. Walters?
Hm?
Oh, I was a 97-pound weakling, darling.
Now, then, ladies, our first test will be chin-ups.
Professor Swanson, you first, please.
Would you like to try now, Dr. Walters?
Very good.
And now we'll move over to the basketball court.
Yeah, we're going to be playing a lot of basketball on the moon.
A lot of basketball.
Yeah.
Well, we'll now test your coordination, ladies by each of you attempting to sink some baskets.
Professor Swanson, you first.
Very good.
Thank you.
Very good.
And now, Dr. Walters, if you please.
Well, I've never done this before, but it looks like it's a gas.
Excellent, Dr. Walters.
Excellent.
And now, uh, if we'll just go Oh.
Excuse me.
Well, congratulations, Dr. Walters, you've just been chosen to train with Major Nelson in our simulated lunar house.
Well That is if the Olympic team doesn't steal you away from us.
Oh, believe me, no one's going to steal me from Major Nelson.
I have some marvelous plans for us.
Say, how did you do that anyway?
I gave it a try myself Oh, excuse me, Major Nelson.
This is your new teammate.
Oh, welcome aboard, Dr. Walters.
Well, at least you get a nice consolation prize, professor.
Oh, what's that, major?
Me.
Well, gentlemen, we have some additional work in my office.
Ladies, we'll see you tomorrow at 8:00.
Yes, uh, tomorrow at 8:00, professor.
Sister?
Oh, well, look who's here.
You look worried, pet.
I am.
Did you not say you'd keep women off the launch pad with my master?
That's right.
They have just selected you to go on this project with him.
Oh, yes, but I'm not another woman.
I'm your sister.
But you will go to the moon with my master.
Oh, don't be such a square, darling.
The moon is a dull lump of clay.
Oh, you mean you will not go there?
I wouldn't be caught dead there.
The really swinging planet is Venus.
Yes?
Oh, hi, come on in.
Good evening, major.
Hi, Tony.
Good evening.
What can I do for you?
We're just on our way to dinner.
We wanted to ask you to join us.
Didn't we, major?
Oh, I Really, I couldn't.
Tell him you insist he join us for dinner.
She wants me to tell you I insist you join us for dinner.
That's the most gracious invitation I've ever had but really I'm sorry, I can't.
You can't?
Oh.
Oh, that's great.
It's part of the program.
We want to see if we're compatible for dinner.
Quick thinking.
I'll get it.
So you're going out?
Yeah?
Major Nelson.
Yes?
They told me at NASA I might find Professor Swanson here.
Professor Swan Oh, yes.
Professor?
Yes?
Sugar.
Turk.
What are you doing here?
I stopped by to see who you're going to the moon with.
Not me.
Him.
Oh, well, I'm just part of the runner-up team.
We'll probably never get off the ground.
Major Healey, Major Nelson, this is my fiancÃ©, Turk Parker.
Turk Parker.
The All-Pro linebacker?
That's right.
Well, how do you do?
Uh, Major Healey and I were just on our way to dinner.
Yeah, well, I have a good idea.
Why don't you join us?
I have a better idea.
Why don't you join us?
That's a better idea.
Uh, you know, you could tell Turk all about the project.
Well, look, it's a little late and I forgot I had another dinner engagement.
I think I'll just go home I have one question I would like to answer now.
Well, what's that?
What happens when you and my girl get to the moon?
Oh, we, uh, plan to read a lot.
I'm going to the library to pick up some books.
What about dinner, Roger?
Bye.
I'm sorry, he gets like this.
Good night, major.
It's been a pleasure meeting you, Turk.
Major Nelson?
Thanks.
It's been a pleasure.
Ooh.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Oh, master?
I've got something to tell you, young lady.
Dr. Walters is my sister.
Dr. Walters is your sister?
Yes.
Yeah.
Well, you knew about it?
You asked her to do this?
Oh, no, master.
Well, it won't work.
She can't go.
The whole point of this project is to put two people on the moon together.
See what'll happen.
And she's not a people, she's a genie.
No, master.
You start blinking.
You get her out of this right away.
No, master.
What do you mean, no?
Well, I cannot.
Why not?
Well, it does not work on genies.
Well, something better work or she's gonna be with me in that lunar house for three whole months.
Lunar house?
Yeah Well, it's a room where they lock us up.
And she cannot get out?
That's right.
Well, that is the answer.
What?
What's the answer?
Genies are afraid of being bottled up.
The moment she discovers that she cannot get out, she will be terrified.
She'll panic and they'll wash her out of the project.
I certainly hope so, master or I am afraid you are going to be swinging on Venus.
What?
This morning, we'll have you familiarize yourselves with the lunar house.
Zulu, Able, Foxtrot.
This is, uh, the lunar mock-up.
I'll be transmitting on 122.8 VHF.
In order to orient yourselves, I think it'd be a good idea to, uh, test out your equipment.
Major Nelson, see that the panel board and the electronic devices are all functioning properly.
Oh, any questions?
Uh, yes.
Dr. Bellows?
Uh, yes, major?
In case of panic, do you want me to abort the mission?
Well, you do have a panic button on the panel.
But I'm sure that it won't be necessary to use it.
Oh, of course not, sir.
I was just checking.
Oh, is there really a panic button?
Uh, don't worry, uh, we'll never have to use it.
Kind of snug in here, isn't it?
Yes, isn't it heaven?
Get off.
You know, a person could get claustrophobia in a place like this.
Just think, after three months, when the project is over, we'll spend three months here.
Three whole months.
Yes, it's truly heaven.
Fight it, fight it.
Oh, fight what, darling?
Well, the The panic The panic that you're feeling now from being all bottled up, I'm sure I'm not feeling panicky.
Oh, yes, you are.
I can see it in your eyes.
Oh, oh.
Major Baby.
Now, listen, just fight it, will you?
I I I know it's awfully hard but it's You're losing your cool, darling.
I'm losing my cool?
You're the one that's losing your cool.
Prof.
Swanson, I want you to notice calm is the most important ingredient.
Yes, I can see that, doctor.
Major Nelson, what's the matter with you?
I I Wait a minute.
Dr. Bellows?
Dr. Bellows, I've got a hysterical woman on my hands.
Isn't he darling?
Major, do you want me to scrub the operation for today?
No.
No, no, no.
Don't scrub the mission.
Everything's gonna be fine.
Carry on.
Lie down, darling, and relax.
You're losing your cool.
No, I'm not losing my cool.
You just close those baby blues and go to sleep.
Now, now, now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I I I think we ought to, uh We ought to take a look at some of our equipment.
Lullaby Dee-dee-dee Now, wait a minute.
You're sure you're not getting a closed-in feeling?
All I feel is togetherness.
Ah!
We're gonna test your breaking point, doctor.
Woo, groovy.
Yeah.
Okay.
Up you go.
Ah!
Ah!
Major Nelson, where are you?
He's up there.
Dr. Walters, what's he doing up there?
What are you doing up there, Major Baby?
Tell him I'm testing the weightlessness.
Oh, he's testing weightlessness.
It's too early for that.
Get him down immediately.
Dr. Walters, what in the world is happening?
I was just trying to get Major Oh.
Oh!
Go to the panel board and press the vacuum pressure button.
Aha.
Yea, daddy.
I don't think this is right.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
She didn't fall apart.
I fell apart.
I cannot understand it.
I was sure she would be terrified of being alone in a closed place.
No, she wasn't the least bit terrified.
Alone?
Mm.
Oh, she was never alone for a second.
I was her security blanket.
You gotta get her bottled up and out before she ruins the whole project.
But if she suddenly disappears.
How are you going to explain it to NASA?
Well, I won't have to explain it to NASA.
Because she is not suddenly gonna disappear.
Oh, listen You sent for me, major?
Oh, yes, Dr. Walters.
I, uh, thought since we're both in the project we might as well spend as much time as possible together.
Groovy.
Yes.
Um, physical fitness is a key factor.
We've got to keep our bodies in good shape.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Well, one of our bodies is in good shape already.
Yes.
Now, the first thing we ought to do is start practicing on the lunar landing chute.
What is the lunar landing chute?
Oh, well, it's this right here.
You see, when we land on the moon we'll have to get to the surface through a tube similar to this.
Well, well, what will they think of next?
Yeah.
Do you want to try it on for size?
Uh, no.
No, it's not my bag.
You're not afraid, are you?
No, no, no.
Well, go ahead, try it on.
I'll be right behind you.
Oh, you'll be in the tube with me.
Sure, sure.
Oh.
Well, that's a whole other scene.
Go ahead.
Oh, look.
Major Nelson.
Ah!
Hello, Dr. Bellows, how are you?
May I ask what you're doing with that trash can?
I'm throwing it out, sir.
Well, I know that, but why?
Well, it's classified trash, and it should be thrown out by a classified man who's classified to throw out the classified trash.
Do I make myself clear?
All of our janitors have security clearances.
They haven't come on duty yet, sir.
They don't come on until 6:00.
And I thought I'd just tidy up the gymnasium.
You show me a clean gymnasium, I'll show you a clean astronaut.
Well, Major Nelson, where's Dr. Walters?
Dr. Walters.
Oh, Dr. Walters?
Sorry I'm late to Ah!
Dr. Walters.
Here's Dr. Walters.
I want you both to report to the lunar house at 1600.
Yes.
Right, sir.
We'll be there at 1600.
Right.
Jeannie, hey, you made it just in time.
You Wh?
Now, you are Jeannie, aren't you?
I mean, I really can't tell Yes, you can.
Yeah, you're my Jeannie.
We'll have another go with lunar house familiarization.
And this time, Major Nelson, try to exercise a little more self-control.
I think everything will be just fine this time, sir.
Oh, you do not have to worry about him.
Listen, I want you to wait a few minutes and then really crack up.
Oh, must I, master?
Jeannie, it's the only way we're gonna get Dr. Walters out of the project.
But now that I am here I am thinking how wonderful it would be to be alone with you on the moon.
Jeannie, the whole idea of the project is to put a man and a woman on the moon together, now, you're not a woman.
That's beside the point.
What is going on, Major Nelson?
We keep losing our picture.
Please, master.
I will keep house for you on the moon just like we do on Earth.
We've just lost the audio too.
Would you go over there and sit down?
Now, Dr. Bellows, I think I've found the problem.
Oh, master.
Jeannie!
Oh, master, what are you doing?
Pull the switch!
What switch?
The red one.
Which?
Oh.
Yes, master.
Do not worry.
Do not worry.
Major Nelson, what's going on?
What's happening?
Jeannie!
Ah!
Thank you, Dr. Walters.
Uh, Dr. Bellows, I think we've remedied the situation.
Incredible.
It just shows you never know how things are gonna work out.
We're gonna have to find a replacement.
Gee, that's too bad.
I hope you weren't too disappointed, sir.
I am sure you will be able to find someone to replace me.
Replace you?
Oh, my dear Dr. Walters, you're going to the moon.
I'm replacing Major Nelson.
It's bad enough they washed me out of the moon project.
But they could have washed me out of the whole NASA program.
I told you I was sorry, master.
Yeah.
Tony.
Yeah?
Good news.
They're giving me a court-martial.
No, no, the whole operation.
First Couple to the Moon has been scrubbed.
No kidding?
No kidding.
Well, did they give an explanation for it?
No, Dr. Bellows says something about the American man and woman has deep-seated male-female hostilities.
They have overly complicated libido problems and they can't resolve the Oedipus complex.
And the linebacker punched Dr. Bellows in the nose.
You're kidding.
But I'll tell you what, listen, the captain barge is throwing a party tonight and he has his two twin sisters there?
Wants me to bring you.
You think?
I'll get my hat.
Yeah.
Tell you what, you think we should bring two cars?
You had better go without him, major.
He will be hanging around the house this evening.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Would you?
Jeannie, would you stop?
Would you?
Would you?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Mmm.
That's delicious.
Sensational, Jeannie.
Well, it was just a little thing I blinked up.
I'm gonna have "thirdsies" on this.
Mmm, mmm.
Oh, uh, Roge.
Aw, come on.
This is the time.
Not presents.
Come on, come on.
Aw, you're embarrassing me.
Every birthday you have to It's Oh Mmm.
Aw, a watch!
Aw, Tony, you shouldn't have.
Well, it's not Look at that.
Now you don't have any excuse for keeping your dates waiting.
It's a beautiful watch, really.
And here is a little gift from me.
Happy birthday!
Oh, Jeannie, you shouldn't have.
Let me try Oh-ho-ho!
Here.
Oh!
How There's nothing in it.
It's It's an empty box.
Oh, no, no.
Anything is inside.
I did not know what to get you so I wrapped up a wish for you.
You mean, I'm going to get my own honest-to-goodness wish?
Yes, all you have to do is ask and you shall receive.
Oh, and to think I thought it was just a plain, ordinary, empty box.
Well, Jeannie and I talked it over, and we thought she might give you a Kind of an Arabian Nights' gift certificate.
Well, I'm gonna hold on to it.
Aw.
Well, it gives me pleasure to give you pleasure.
Mmm.
Well, now, I must do the dishes.
Hm?
Aw Wait!
Whoa!
Now, hold it, hold it!
Tsk.
Well, at least you don't have to worry about leftovers.
Hey, this is one gift I'll never have to return.
I'll never wanna return it.
Oh, Roger, look, I've had a lot of experience with wishes, and you gotta be very careful with what you do with it.
Now, wait a minute.
Oh, that's easy for you to say.
Yeah.
I mean, you wished to fly Trailblazer 1 and you got it.
How 'bout me?
I'm the one who should be envious.
I mean, I'm just on the backup team.
Boy, I'd sure like to trade places with you.
Yeah.
Good night, Tony.
Good night, Roge.
Jeannie?
How 'bout a cup of coffee?
Yes, master, coming up.
Over here, Jeannie.
Oh.
I did not know you wished a cup too.
I'm the one who asked for the cup.
Oh, no, I distinctly heard my master.
Oh.
That is a very good trick, master.
What trick?
The way my master throws his voice, Major Healey.
Jeannie, what are you talking about?
Major Healey just left.
Oh  What's so funny?
Oh.
Oh  What's so funny?
Oh, that is funny.
Oh, come, master.
I will show you.
Wait a minute.
Jeannie, what's Roger's reflection doing in my mirror?
That is not his reflection any longer, master.
It is yours.
Mine?
I am very much afraid that Major Healey is now occupying your body.
And you  are occupying his.
Well, if that isn't the silliest thing I've ever heard in my whole life.
I mean, how could Roger be?
Wait a minute.
Don't tell me.
He wished that he could change places with me because of the Trailblazer 1 flight?
Is it not exciting?
Oh, I'm thrilled down to my Down to Roger's toes.
Now you just unthrill me and give me my body back.
It may not be I may not be an Adonis, but it's the only body I have and I'm used to it.
Oh, I cannot.
I gave it as a gift.
Well, if you can turn me into a Roger and Roger into me, well, just turn yourself into an exchange counter.
Department stores do it every day.
It should be a breeze for you.
Oh, but, master, genies can Once they grant a wish, they cannot take it back.
Oh, when I get my hands on that Roger, I'm going to What am I saying?
With him in my body, I might be killing an innocent man.
How do you get me into these things?
Jeannie, it's not funny.
Oh  Hello, Major Nelson.
Oh, Healey.
Pardon me.
Healey.
I'm Major Healey.
Oh, major, you and your sense of humor.
You're marvelous.
Heh.
You know that impersonation of Major Healey's voice you're doing is very good.
Impersonation?
Oh, I've got a great idea.
You must do this at the NASA Follies next month.
You'll be sensational.
Uh, Mrs. Bellows, uh, eh, you feeling all right?
Why, yes, Major Nelson, I feel perfectly fine.
Thank you.
Uh, Healey.
Major Nelson has s-small eyes and less hair.
Oh.
We don't look at all alike.
Of course not.
Heh.
How silly of me.
Major Nelson doesn't live here.
No.
I do.
I just come from Tony's place.
We had a party.
It's my birthday.
Oh, look at the wild present they ga May I see?
No, you wouldn't be interested.
Uh, may I see it, please?
Oh, well, no, it It's not I love to look at presents.
It's very nice.
Should look very well on you.
Wear it in good health.
Good night.
Poor woman.
To think her husband's a psychiatrist.
Jeannie, I've got to fly Trailblazer 1.
I've been trained for it.
I've been briefed for it.
Now you've got to straighten this thing out.
Besides, I'm not so crazy about wearing this face.
Well, I do not know what I can do about it, master.
It is out of my hands.
Only Major Healey can take back his wish.
You mean Roger has the power to call this thing off?
Mm-hm.
Well, uh Well, why didn't you say so?
I'm coming.
These aren't my keys.
I'm coming.
I These aren't my keys.
I must've left my keys at Tony's.
Oh  Ugh.
Maybe he's at the Officers' Club.
Let's go see if he's there, huh?
Yeah, yeah.
Hurry.
Hurry, Jeannie.
You say he insisted he was Major Healey?
He not only insisted upon it, dear, but he kept doing that imitation of Major Healey's voice.
Of course I went along with it, even though he wasn't half as good as I said he was.
You know, I was actually terrified.
Oh, it was probably some sort of a prank.
A joke.
Well, I don't think it's very funny.
Especially when he kept trying to keep me from looking into that empty box that he was carrying.
Empty box?
Yes, darling.
He said that it was a birthday present from Major Nelson, an empty box.
Really, dear, do you think it's safe to have men like that roaming about the skies all by themselves?
Mmm.
No answer at Major Healey's apartment.
I think perhaps I'd better drop in on Major Nelson and see what this is all about.
I have a feeling it's going to be one of those nights.
Uh, where are the keys to the car?
Oh, I left them in the ignition, dear.
Oh, good.
Well see you later, hon.
I, uh, won't be late.
Good night.
Good night, sir.
Joe, have you seen Major Healey?
You're Major Healey.
That's right.
Have you seen Major Nelson?
Oh, just one moment, sir, I'll check.
Are you sure he hasn't been around here this evening?
You Your voice, it sounds an awful lot like Major Nelson's.
Oh, well, I got a little laryngitis.
Ahem.
Uh good night, Joe.
Let's go, Jeannie.
Roger!
Where's Roger?
You could say hello, baby.
Hello, baby.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?
Oh, Jeannie, this is, uh Ugh!
The other night I was the only girl in the world for you.
And tonight I'm I'm "Uh"?
I'm "Uh," huh?
Happy splashdown, Astronaut Healey.
Roger certainly has some interesting girlfriends.
Let's go, Jeannie.
Tony!
Tony?
Oh, tsk.
Oh, good evening, major.
Oh, good evening, Dr. Bellows.
Just getting some fresh air?
Uh, I'm waiting for Major Nelson.
You're waiting for Major Nelson.
Yes, uh I He's not at home.
He He has an extra key to my apartment, and, uh, I was waiting for them For him to come back.
Oh, tell me, uh, when did you first notice that, uh, Major Nelson was gone?
When I got here.
When else?
Yes.
Uh, when else?
Uh, shall we go?
Go, Dr. Bellows?
Yes, I, uh I'd like you to return to the medical center with me, seeing that the, uh, Trailblazer 1 flight is set for tomorrow.
Um, I'd like to check out a few things with you.
Uh, shall we?
Bu But  But, master, there are many other places.
Major Healey may have gone to.
Mmm, with all of his women floating around and a glass of water from each of 'em, I might drown before the evening is over.
If there was just some other way we could find him.
If we just had some idea where he might be.
An excellent idea.
Oh Oh, master, I know just the thing!
What is that?
A bloodhound, master.
He is most efficient.
A bloodhound?
You got me a bloodhound?
If you think that I'm so desperate that I'm gonna use a bloodhound Come on.
Come on, boy.
Sic him.
Go get him!
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Go get Roger.
Go get him.
Sic him.
Sic him, boy!
Now, boy, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You don't understand.
Whoa, whoa.
You don't understand.
I'm I'm I'm Tony.
You see, I'm in Major Nelson's body.
You see, we We changed bodies.
We have the same faces, but it's a different mind.
What are you looking at?
Now, come on.
Let's go get him, okay?
Oh, yeah.
Look at the picture.
Recognize him?
Dark hair, okay?
That's it.
Get the picture?
All right, good.
Here, let's go.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
Get him, boy!
Get him!
Yeah.
It's him all right.
Aw, then you do admit that is Major Nelson you see, right, Major Nelson?
Major Healey.
