{START OF EPISODE 01}
Hymie, stand.
Y-11 calling KAOS, Y-11 calling KAOS from CONTROL headquarters.
Man: This is KAOS.
Go ahead.
Hymie the CONTROL robot has been programmed.
He's ready to begin.
When the job is completed, his memory bank will automatically erase itself.
He will be unable to recall what happened.
Excellent, proceed as planned.
Yes, sir.
Hymie, go.
To all departments, it has come to my attention that some members of the CONTROL organization have been abusing the privileges of the coffee break.
One, coffee breaks will be for 10 minutes duration.
Two, coffee cups will no longer be used for target practice.
Three-- Hymie, what's the meaning of this?
!
I am going to kill you.
-  - Hey!
I'm going to kill you.
-  - I'm going to kill you.
Hymie, I'm The Chief.
I'm your friend.
Chief!
Max, Max, quick!
Hymie's trying to kill The Chief.
- Hymie, stop it.
It's me, Max!
- What are you trying to do, Max?
I'm gonna have to short-circuit his wiring system.
- Hurry hurry.
- Hymie, are you AC or DC?
- I am going to kill you.
- Hurry, Max.
I think he's AC.
I'll plug him into DC and see what happens.
- Quick!
- Hold on, Chief, use those fantastic throat muscles.
I am going to kill you.
-  - 99: What happened, Chief?
He crashed through that door and said he was gonna kill me.
But this is impossible, Chief.
Hymie has been a loyal member of CONTROL ever since we stole him from KAOS.
Max, Hymie is a robot-- a machine.
And machines can be dangerous.
What are we going to do?
- We'll have to destroy him.
- Destroy him!
You can't destroy Hymie.
Hymie's my friend.
Max, this friend just broke through my office door, smashed my desk to pieces and almost strangled me with his bare hands!
How do you explain that?
I said he was my friend, not yours.
Kirsch, Phelps-- you men are in charge of security procedures.
- Have you any idea how this happened?
- No, sir.
- Is Hymie locked up?
- Yes, sir.
He's harmless until his main power unit is reactivated.
Keep him that way.
I don't want him breaking up - any more of our furniture.
- Yes, sir.
I just can't believe he did it.
- Why?
!
- Because he's programmed for neatness.
I don't care what he's programmed for, he's got to be disassembled, - and you're gonna do it.
- Me?
!
Why me?
Why not?
You brought him into the organization, didn't you?
I can't do that to Hymie, Chief.
Hymie is my friend.
Why, he saved my life once.
- He's like a brother to me.
- Max, Hymie is a cybernaut.
What's his religion got to do with it?
He's a robot-- a mechanical man-- and I want him disassembled.
- I won't do it.
- You won't?
No, I won't!
I'd rather you have me disassembled than Hymie.
- Hmm - I'll do it.
- Okay, Hymie, cough.
-  -  - Oh, boy.
My guess is that someone has really been tampering around with your insides.
Now think, Hymie.
Think hard.
Don't you remember anything that happened at all?
The last thing I remember, I was in the lab oiling my teeth.
- Oiling your teeth?
- I oil my teeth twice a day and see a mechanic every six months.
- Oh.
- I have a tendency to rust.
The next thing I knew was a few minutes ago when you reactivated my main power unit.
You don't remember attacking The Chief - and trying to choke him?
- No.
Hmm.
I'll tell you this much, unless we get some clues on how this happened, - I'm gonna have to-- - I know, Max.
You'll have to disassemble me.
- I can't do it, Hymie.
- You have to do it, Max.
- It's your duty.
- Don't tell me my duty.
- I know what it is.
- Don't worry about me, I understand.
The security of the nation is at stake.
- Oh, Hymie.
- I've had a good life.
Will you stop talking like that, Hymie?
Hymie, will you please be quiet?
I can't concentrate.
- Just shut your trap.
-  Hymie, do you have to take everything I say so literally?
I'm sorry, Max.
Okay, just get a grip on yourself.
Forget it, Hymie.
This is what I want you to do.
This is the key to my apartment-- take it, get over there and stay there.
But someone will see me when I leave here.
Not if you jump out the window.
It's only to point of impact.
Make as little noise as possible.
Try to jump on the grass, not the pavement.
- Right.
- Oh, Hymie, If anybody sees you going into my apartment, tell them you're my cousin.
- Right.
- Okay.
- Is anybody coming?
- No.
Okay.
Now remember, jump on the grass, not the sidewalk.
Okay-- jump!
Missed it by that much.
Oh, hello, uh I was looking for Max.
- Is he home?
- No.
I haven't seen you around here before.
Are you a friend of his?
I am Max's cousin.
May I help you?
Oh, yes, I wanted to borrow some sugar.
- Sugar.
- Just enough for a cup of coffee.
Or two.
I have to tell you, men, this has been a trying experience for Max.
- We understand, Chief.
-   I'm finished, Chief.
So long, Hymie.
Are you all right, Max?
Yes, Chief, but this has been kind of a sad day for me.
I'd like to go home.
Of course.
You can have the whole day off-- and take tomorrow off too.
Thank you, Chief.
With pay?
Okay.
How about overtime?
Overtime?
!
No, absolutely not!
Okay, okay, you don't have to shout.
I may be greedy, but I'm not deaf.
- Hello, Hymie.
- Have a nice day at the office?
Yes, thank you.
I think I'll just fix myself a cup of coffee and then we'll get down to work.
- Do you use sugar?
- No.
- Good.
- Why?
- There isn't any.
- There isn't any?
But that's ridiculous, I've just bought a 10-lb bag.
Listen, Hymie, I'm getting a little worried that someone has been tampering with your mechanism.
Many have looked at my works.
Did they touch any tubes or fiddle with your wires?
I don't think so.
Try and remember, Hymie, because if someone has been tampering with your circuits, it would have to be somebody from inside of CONTROL.
That means we've got a spy in our midst.
I have checked my memory tape.
- There's no record of tampering.
- Hmm Let's see.
I've got some books here on electronics.
Maybe if I look through them, I can find out some-- Now, let's see, if we take these two wires, and put them over here by the connecting rod, I think we got something, Hymie.
Hymie, where is my cigarette?
!
- I put it in my pocket.
- You put it in your pocket.
May I ask you why you put it in your pocket?
!
It was getting the ashtray dirty again.
Okay, Hymie.
A-ha, just as I thought-- - there is a spy.
- Really?
He must be very small.
No, Hymie, I didn't mean inside of you, I meant inside of CONTROL.
You tickle me.
Will you stop that?
!
That's just an expression, Hymie.
Now, it's obvious that you've been rewired.
That's why you attacked The Chief.
Think-- can you remember anybody else being inside of there besides me?
I have a vague memory of a pair of cold hands.
They probably erased your memory tape.
- What do we do now?
- Well, whoever the spy is who was fooling around inside here probably thinks that you're destroyed, and we've got to have him think that way so it'll give us time to find out who it is.
- Right.
- Now, we've got to take every precaution to see that nobody knows that you're here.
that means no standing by open windows, no loud talking and if someone should happen to knock at the front door, don't make a sound.
-  - Come in.
- Hello, Max.
- Phoebe?
!
I just wanna return the sugar I borrowed from your cousin.
Oh, thank you.
My cousin?
Oh, yes, of course, my cousin.
- You two have met?
- Well, not formally.
- My name is Hymie.
- How do you do?
My name is Phoebe.
Uh, Phoebe is The Chief's niece.
By the way, Phoebe, what are you doing here in Washington?
I just decided to come in for a few days.
My uncle suggested I take a room here and you could kind of look after me.
Or if you're busy, maybe Hymie could.
Uh, yes.
Well, Hymie, don't you have a very important engagement?
I'm sorry, but that's probably been erased from my memory tape.
Don't pay any attention to him, Phoebe.
He's an electronics genius.
Oh, are you in electronics?
No, electronics are in me.
Yes, well, Phoebe, it was certainly nice of you to drop by.
- Perhaps we can have dinner some night.
- I'd love to.
- Good, good.
Bye, Phoebe.
- Bye-bye.
"Electronics are in me"?
Hmph.
That's just beautiful.
Now all she's gotta do is tell The Chief you're here and we will both be disassembled.
Hymie, what are you doing?
Will you stop cleaning up, following me around and picking up?
You're beginning to get on my nerves!
I am programmed for neatness.
I'm programmed for sloppiness, and that's the way I like it.
What's the matter now?
Our first fight.
Look, Hymie, I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I know you've been under a big strain for the past two days.
A lot you care.
I do care.
Then why don't you ever tell me?
I care, I care!
That's not the way to say it.
What are you talking about?
- This is ridiculous!
-  Shh, get in the closet.
Oh, Kirsch, hello.
What can I do for you?
- I heard some noise.
Is anything wrong?
- Oh no, no, no.
Nothing at all.
I was just talking to myself.
- What are you doing here?
- Chief wants you back at headquarters.
- Oh.
Why didn't you phone?
- Top security.
Oh, okay, Kirsch, wait here.
I'll get my coat.
I'll be with you in a minute.
Yes, Chief, what is it?
Max, did you disassemble Hymie this morning?
Of course I disassembled Hymie.
I even brought you the bag of parts.
We had those parts reconstructed.
Let me show you what we got.
- Max?
!
- For heaven's sake.
Don't you worry, Hymie, I'll have you back looking like your old self in no time at all.
Max, Kirsch and Phelps charge you with allowing Hymie to escape.
We contend that you never disassembled Hymie.
Nor did you intend to.
Do you think that I would resort to deliberate lies, deceit and disobedience?
!
All: Yes!
- How about this?
- All right, men, - I'll take it from here.
- Right, Chief.
Well, Max, your little game is over.
I want to know what you've done with Hymie, and I want to know right now!
Max, if you're trying to put something over on me-- I'm not, Chief, I'm not!
I'm telling you, this is really Hymie.
They just put him together wrong.
You'd better be able to prove it!
Look, Chief, I've got an idea-- why don't I take the pieces home and try to put them together over the weekend?
No, Max, I want to see you reassemble him here and now!
Well, Chief, it's easy to take a guy apart, but it's pretty difficult to put him back together again.
Ask any doctor.
Here and now.
Yes, sir, I've just made the new adjustment.
- How will it work?
- Through his own ingenuity, the robot will get Maxwell Smart to take him to a public restaurant for dinner.
When he hears the phrase, "Waiter, the check," he will shoot the one who said it-- - Maxwell Smart.
- Very good.
Well, that's it, Chief.
That's about the best I can do.
You know, Max, if this thing isn't Hymie, then he has escaped and you're an accessory!
Did you ever think that this might be Hymie's way of proving his innocence?
By running away?
No, by coming back as a washing machine, Chief.
Think of the possibilities-- a washing machine could go anyplace.
-  - I don't think-- Hello?
Oh, yes, he is.
Just a moment.
It's for you.
It's your cousin.
Eh, hello?
Max, this is Hymie.
Yes, I know.
I'm in The Chief's office.
- What's the matter?
- I'm lonesome.
You're lone-- well, I'll be home in a little while.
I want to go out to dinner.
I don't think that would be wise.
I don't care.
I've been cooped up in the house all day-- sweeping, dusting, vacuuming.
I want to go out.
We'll talk about it when-- when I get home.
Good, I'll ask Phoebe to join us.
Bye.
Uh-- I tell you, we just can't take the chance.
It's not worth the risk to be seen in public, Hymie.
It's too much of a gamble, Hymie.
But we have to.
I promised her.
Her?
Who's her?
Hi, Max.
Hi, Hymie.
Hello there.
Here I am, all set for a big night out in the city.
- Her?
- Her.
Where are we going to dinner?
Yes, Max, where are we going to dinner?
I know a nice quiet little out-of-the-way place.
- Where?
- Nome, Alaska.
Max, we've got to do something about Phoebe.
Maybe we could get her some dancing lessons.
That's not what I mean, Max.
You know what would happen if The Chief found out that you let his niece go out with a robot, to say nothing of falling in love with one?
I don't know, 99.
Phoebe's parents would like to see her get married and settle down and have kids.
- I can see it now.
- What do you mean?
Hymie in the garage tuning up his body, and Phoebe in the nursery winding up her children.
You may have a point there.
Listen, 99, this is what I want you to do-- I want you to dance with Hymie, - and I'll stay here and talk to Phoebe.
- Right, Max.
- That looks like fun.
- It was.
- Thank you, Hymie.
- Very good, Hymie.
You guys can really dance.
- Hymie, may I have the next dance?
-  - Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.
Oh, isn't he wonderful, Max?
For the first time in my life - I know what it means to be in love.
- Look, Phoebe, you and your uncle have been friends of mine for a long, long time, and I'd like to kind of have you think of me as another uncle-- someone who has your best interest at heart, someone who wouldn't hurt you for anything - in the world.
- All right.
Phoebe, I want you to forget about Hymie.
But Uncle Max, I think I'm in love with him.
But you don't know anything about him.
You don't know anything about his background.
And believe me, it's a strange one.
I wouldn't care if he came from a junkyard.
Funny you should put it that way.
Besides, a man's background isn't what's important-- it's what's inside that counts.
Would you be surprised.
Uncle Max, I'm 19 years old.
I'm old enough to make up my own mind.
- How old is Hymie?
- He'll be a year old in December.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- I didn't think you'd understand.
Look, Phoebe, I didn't wanna tell you this, but it's for your own good.
- Hymie is a cybernaut.
- Uncle Max, I'm ashamed of you.
A person's religion doesn't make any difference.
Oh, Max, Hymie is a marvelous dancer.
And he's so intelligent-- cute too.
You too?
Hymie, see if you can grab a waiter.
Now, listen both of you-- this is very important.
We've got to get Hymie out of here as inconspicuously as possible.
I'll pay the check and bring the car around, then you two bring Hymie out.
And remember, don't attract any attention to him.
Right, Max.
Hymie, let him go.
You did tell him to grab the waiter.
Hymie, I just wanted you to attract his attention so I could pay the check.
- I will pay the check.
- No, Hymie, it's my treat.
- I will pay the check.
- Next time, Hymie.
- I will pay the check.
-   el cheque, por favor.
What does that mean, Hymie?
It means "I am very sorry, waiter.
The check, please".
Oh, come on, Hymie, the check can't be that much.
You're sure no one came to the door, Hymie?
I don't remember.
has been tampering with Hymie again.
But no one knows he's here except you, me and Phoebe.
Are you sure that no one's visited the apartment since Hymie came here?
No, nobody.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Kirsch.
Of course, Kirsch's been nearby every time Hymie has gone haywire.
Quite right, 86.
- You see what I mean?
- On your feet, please-- all of you.
You know, of course, that bullet at the restaurant - was meant for you, Mr. Smart.
- Sorry about that, Kirsch.
No matter.
They say everything works out for the best.
In a moment, Hymie will kill you both.
Wait a minute, Kirsch-- you're talking with a foreign accent.
I am not.
I am speaking perfectly.
As spy in CONTROL I had foreign accent.
You overlooked one thing, Kirsch.
- Hymie, get him.
-  You see, Mr. Smart, he's in my control now.
Max, get the gun!
Good work, Hymie.
I heard some-- oh!
- Oh, Hymie, are you all right?
- But, Max, I don't understand.
I thought Kirsch had complete control over Hymie.
He did, 99, but Hymie's programming for neatness was stronger than his programming for evil.
- Max!
- Chief!
What are you doing here?
I suspected Kirsch was up to something.
I followed him here.
Yes, Chief, it was Kirsch who rewired Hymie and programmed him to attack you.
That solves that problem.
What's going on there?
She loves him, Chief.
My niece in love with a robot?
Well, it's not so bad, Chief.
It could have been a washing machine.
You've done it again, Max, even though your methods were a little unorthodox.
Sorry I had to disobey your orders, Chief, but I knew Hymie was innocent.
I simply had to go out and prove it.
Now my problem is what am I gonna do about Phoebe?
Yes, well, I've had long talk with Phoebe, Chief, and I've explained everything to her - and I think she understands.
-  Chief: Phoebe!
Are you all right?
Yes, Max explained everything to me.
He was very kind and patient.
He made me understand something - that I hadn't realized before.
- What?
Well, I almost made a terrible mistake.
I met a man who was warm and considerate, and because I had a schoolgirl crush on someone else, I almost passed him by.
But now I know who I really love.
- You don't mean-- - Yes.
Max, can you ever forgive me?
Phoebe, I've known Max for a long while, and believe me, I'm very fond of him, but if it comes down to a choice between the two of them, please take Hymie.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Woman on  Attention please, flight number 305 for Chicago is now loading at Gate 3.
Excuse me, young man, aren't you holding that newspaper upside down?
Oh, yes, thank you very much.
Busybody.
Hello, 47?
This is 86.
Well, all we know so far is that the counterfeit money is being smuggled into the country, hidden somewhere, then picked up by KAOS agents who are using it to finance their operations and disrupt our economy.
You think you may have a clue?
Well, hold on a second until I find a pencil.
Okay, go ahead.
I've got one.
they're onto me.
Max: Never mind about that.
What's the clue?
-  - How do you spell that?
Max: What is the clue?
In a minute.
But do me a favor.
- Anything, 47.
Anything.
- This is important.
As you know, I'm head negotiator for the new labor contract between CONTROL agents and CONTROL.
You'll have to-- you'll have to take my place, 86.
Sure.
Sure thing.
Sure thing, 47.
But first give me the clue.
No.
First, you have to take the official oath.
I have to be standing up when I give you the oath.
Help me up.
Easy, easy there.
Now repeat after me-- I, 86, hereby promise to act in good faith-- "I, 86, hereby promise to act in good faith--" - You sure we have to be standing?
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.
- As head negotiator for CONTROL agents-- ooh, ah.
"As head negotiator for CONTROL agents-- ooh, ah".
In their battle for a more equitable contract with CONTROL.
"In their battle for a more equitable contract with CONTROL".
Now quick, 47, what's the clue?
We forgot the secret handshake.
I now pronounce you the new head negotiator for the Guild of Surviving CONTROL Agents.
Quick, before it's too late.
"The little red tractor that huffed and puffed".
"The little red tractor that huffed and puffed".
What does it mean, 47?
Operator: That'll be 10¢ for the next three minutes, please.
Just a minute, Operator.
Agent 47, I solemnly promise to take over as union negotiator, and as soon as I have time, to track down the vital clue you just gave me and I just forgot.
Operator: "The little red tractor that huffed and puffed".
Thank you, Operator.
All right, men.
As the new head negotiator for the Guild of Surviving CONTROL Agents, I hereby call this secret meeting to order.
First, before I begin, I'd like to compliment you men on the wonderful way that you sneaked in here and hid.
Looking around, I have no idea where any of you is hiding.
Now to get on with the business of the day, First of all, we'll have roll call.
Oh, sorry about that, 25.
- Okay, Agent 61.
- 61: Here.
- Agent 12.
-  Agent 82.
Still hiding out in the old organ, huh, 82?
Agent 74.
Agent 35?
Agent 35?
You're five minutes late, Agent 35.
All right, gentlemen.
Let's let the meeting proceed.
Sorry again, 25.
You all know what this secret meeting was called for.
Chief, what are you doing here?
This is an emergency, Max.
I had to find you.
How did you find me?
This is supposed to be a secret meeting.
I had Agent K-13 track you.
Fang, what are you, some kind of a furry strike-breaker?
Max, Fang is an agent first.
He knows his duty.
Well, I know my duty too, Chief.
How would you like it if I give you an ultimatum?
How would you like it if I give you a choice between Fang and me?
How would you like that?
Perhaps I phrased that badly.
Max, there's nobody here.
Who are you supposed to be talking to?
Every male CONTROL agent is here, Chief.
They're just so well hidden and disguised as pieces of furniture that you can't tell where they are.
Well, this meeting will have to wait.
It's imperative that we get to work on the KAOS counterfeit case before they flood the country with bogus bills.
I'm sorry, Chief, but this meeting can't wait.
Of course we'll call it off as soon as we take a vote and decide whether we're gonna go out on strike at midnight tonight.
Max, you men wouldn't go on strike.
Ho, ho, ho.
Yes, we would if certain demands are not met.
For example, let's take the question of a week off with pay for having to swallow secret government documents.
Max, be reasonable.
We're working on a limited budget.
Don't tell me, Chief.
Tell them.
Now listen, men.
Be reasonable.
You there.
You know perfectly well as your Chief of CONTROL-- - Chief.
- What?
That's just a lamp you're talking to.
Now, another thing, Chief, and I think this is very important-- the question of double overtime in case we're shot, wounded or poisoned - on Grellman's birthday.
- Grellman's birthday?
What in heaven's name is that?
That's code, Chief, for Washington's birthday.
This is ridiculous.
For example, you-- have you ever been shot, wounded or poisoned on Grellman's birthday?
Chief, it's only a sofa.
Here's a point that all the men are very, very interested in.
For example, if we're captured by enemy agents and taken to a foreign country, why can't we come back tourist class instead of having to stow away?
That's a good question.
You know perfectly well if I had the power to help you in any way-- - Chief.
- What?
!
It's only a chest of drawers.
This whole conversation is absolutely useless.
I expect you in my office within half an hour.
- Are you coming or are you staying?
-  Max: Good boy, Fang.
I knew you'd stick with us, Fang.
Just for being so reliable, I'm gonna take you with me on our next assignment.
Just think of it-- we'll be together again, facing danger, torture and death.
That dog is almost human.
"The little red tractor that huffed and puffed".
Max, is that the only clue that Agent 47 left?
Chief, as the new head negotiator for the Guild of Surviving CONTROL Agents, I must warn you that in exactly 10 hours and 43 seconds we are all going out on strike!
Max, please.
"The little red tractor that huffed and puffed".
Must be some kind of code, Chief.
- That's possible, 99.
- That's it, Chief.
- Chief: That's what?
- "Red" means Communist.
"Tractor" means farmer.
"Huffed and puffed" means tired.
What that's supposed to mean?
I don't know.
Find a tired Communist farmer and ask him.
Chief, I was just going over the things in Agent 47's pocket and I found this.
It's a bookmark from "Ye Olde Bookshop".
Could "The little red tractor that huffed and puffed" be the name of a book?
- I doubt that very much, 99.
- Get me the public library.
I consider myself an expert on books, and I don't think that has anything to do with it.
Hello, is this the public library?
Yes.
Does the phrase, "The little red tractor that huffed and puffed" mean anything to you?
It does?
The title of a new children's book.
Thank you very much.
Good thinking, 99.
Max, you go over to this "Ye Olde Bookshop" and see what you can find out.
But be careful, - it may be a KAOS front.
- Right, Chief.
Oh, Chief, before I go, I think I must warn you that you only have now nine hours and 54 minutes before every male CONTROL agent goes out on strike.
Max, I have made my final concessions on a new contract.
- Now, go over to that bookstore.
- Okay, Chief, I'm going, but I don't understand your attitude.
The least you could do is issue us new bulletproof shirts.
I'm ashamed to wear the one I've got.
Look at it-- it's full of holes.
If it wasn't for my bulletproof undershirt, I'd be in a lot of trouble.
Kaos Agent K-12 hasn't picked up "The Little Red Tractor that Huffed and Puffed" yet, Madame Verna.
- He was due yesterday.
-  - Good morning.
- Good morning.
May I help you?
Yes, I'm interested in a children's book.
Do you have any particular book in mind?
Yes, as a matter of fact I do.
"The Little Red Tractor that Huffed and Puffed".
Here you are, sir.
I'm sure your child will enjoy it, especially page 52.
Page 52, eh?
Thank you.
He just took the book and walked out?
Something must have made him suspicious, and he decided to play it safe.
Maybe he knew something about one of those old ladies.
Well, Max, the decoding department came out with a complete blank on this copy of page 52.
Did they try the "every third word" technique, Chief?
Yes, they did.
Listen-- "Good boy happy see why huff and little then why not".
It doesn't work.
And it makes it hard to follow the story too.
We've got to stop this insidious flow of counterfeit money.
Now take this book, go back to the store and see what else you can find out.
Right, Chief, but I have to hurry.
In seven hours every CONTROL agent lays down his gun and goes out on strike.
- I haven't forgotten, Max.
- Don't forget these, Max.
- Oh, thank you, 99.
- What are they?
They're the signs we'll be carrying when we go out on strike.
They don't make any sense, Max.
Of course not, 99.
They're in code.
What about those two little old ladies you followed?
They seemed harmless enough.
They went directly from here to the race track.
I'm sorry, but the child didn't enjoy this book at all, especially page 52.
- Oh, I understand, sir.
- You do?
And may I say it was extremely intelligent of your child to be so careful?
Here.
"The Little Old Lady Who Lived in a Spaceship".
And may I especially draw your attention to page 39.
Just page 39?
That's all?
Just page 39.
I wonder if you can give me another little hint.
What kind of hint?
Well, you know-- how the book turns out.
Ahem, ahem.
Okay.
He's leaving again.
Man: What was he doing here?
- Verna: Who?
- Maxwell Smart.
- Maxwell Smart!
- The CONTROL agent?
Intercept Maxwell Smart at his apartment and get that book back.
- And then-- - Then what?
Then eradicate Smart.
You sure have a way with words.
-  - Hello.
Max: Hello, is this the Chief of CONTROL?
Max, you know very well it is.
Well, Chief of CONTROL, as the new head negotiator for the Guild of Surviving CONTROL Agents, I feel it is my duty to remind you that we go on strike at exactly midnight tonight.
Unless, of course, certain demands are met-- especially in the areas of overtime, convalescence leaves, vacations with pay and a summer clothing allowance for black and white shoe phones.
I understand, Mr. Smart.
Thank you for calling.
Oh, Chief, one more thing-- I have some new very important developments on the KAOS counterfeiting case.
You have?
What, Max?
Well, I can't tell you now, Chief.
You'll have to call me back and ask for Agent 86.
Max, why can't you simply tell me now?
Because this is strictly a labor relations call.
Max.
- Hello, Agent 86 here.
- Yes, Max?
Oh hi, Chief.
Glad you called.
Now about that KAOS counterfeiting case, I went back to the bookstore and they gave me a new children's book-- "The Little Old Lady Who Lived in a Spaceship".
And this time they referred me to page 39.
Page 39, huh?
Have you been able to make any sense out of it yet?
Well, no, Chief, as a matter of fact I haven't.
Get your codebook out right away and try to decode page 39.
Right, Chief.
Oh, hi.
Your hands up, please, Mr. Smart.
How did you get in here?
The door was locked.
Well, very simple, Mr. Smart-- a sharp blow precisely 12 inches above the center of the lock and the door opens automatically.
Turn around!
Wait a minute.
Didn't I see you in the bookstore?
That's correct.
I'll take that book.
I don't understand-- on the inside cover it says that I'm allowed to keep it for three days.
Well, I'm very sorry, Mr. Smart.
I've been told to kill you, and as a good KAOS agent - I must obey.
- I see.
Uh, first of all, before you shoot, I'd like to ask you a very important question.
What's so great about page 39?
The contents of the page itself are meaningless, Mr. Smart.
Of course-- - the page number!
- Precisely.
Not that it will do you any good, but the three stands for the third row of books down from the top on the book shelves along the back wall of the bookshop.
And the nine means the ninth book from the right.
Have you any other last requests, Mr. Smart?
- I'd like to read something to you.
- What?
The complete works of William Shakespeare.
-  - Hold it!
I think one of us has been shot.
I think it's me.
Where did you shoot me?
- Left chest.
-  Good.
- Good?
- As a KAOS agent, I get double indemnity for getting shot above the waist.
Double indemnity for being shot only once?
Not only that, if I'm shot and I don't die instantly, my family gets an additional 25% for suffering.
Unbelievable.
And if I survive my wounds, I get a guaranteed six weeks convalescence leave with pay.
With pay?
You gotta be putting me on.
Not only that, we get to stay free at any resort on our KAOS credit card-- American plan.
Three superb meals a day, tennis, golf, bingo parties, dance lessons, and free funerals.
Lucky devil.
Bingo parties?
I didn't know KAOS was religious.
-  - It's right back there against the back wall.
Chief, did I say 93 or 39?
I think you said 39.
Hurry up, Max.
Don't rush me, Chief.
Now, let me see.
What was it?
It was the third shelf from the top and the ninth book over-- here it is, Chief.
Say, I haven't read this one yet-- "She Couldn't Say No".
- We didn't come for reading material.
- How do you like that?
Nothing, not even a secret compartment.
Wait a minute, Max.
There's something taped on here.
A-ha.
Hey, Chief, you know what that looks like?
It looks like one of those keys to a coin locker at a bus depot.
Well, at least now we know where those KAOS agents have been picking up their counterfeit money.
Let's go.
And as the old saying goes, gentlemen, "A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing".
How do you like that?
The old secret-panel- in-the-bookcase trick.
- How corny can you get?
- It fooled you, didn't it?
Just barely.
Don't let them get away, you fool!
Man: Turn on the lights.
Max: Hold it!
Stay right where you are.
One move and I shoot.
Sorry about that, Chief.
Max!
Max, that's good shooting.
I know, Chief.
I got him right on the fiction section.
- Hold it.
- Max: You hold it.
Okay, Chief, I'll take over.
I'll just take this guy downtown-- it's 12:00 midnight.
Max, you let him get his gun back.
Well, Chief, as a loyal member of the Guild for Surviving CONTROL Agents, I go out on strike at exactly 12:00 midnight.
I sympathize with you, Mr. Smart.
You're not gonna shoot us in cold blood.
As Chief of Agents, you will make an excellent hostage.
However, it will give KAOS a great pleasure to rid itself of the troublesome Maxwell Smart once and for all.
- Are you ready, Mr. Smart?
- Just a minute.
Chief, before I die, I'd like to make one last appeal and ask you to please sign this contract.
All right, Max, anything you say.
Is that a standard contract?
- What about free funerals?
- Free funerals?
I've never heard of such a thing.
Chief, how can you be so cheap?
That man is going to kill me.
All right, Max, free funerals.
And four free weeks with pay after jumping from a moving train?
Four weeks with pay, now that's out of line.
Okay, Chief, okay.
Goodbye.
All right, Max.
All right, I'll sign it.
Thank you, Chief.
And now if you don't mind, I'll just take that gun.
Thank goodness that gun misfired, Max.
Not misfired, Chief.
No bullets.
You knew that gun wouldn't fire?
Max, I consider that a very underhanded way to get me to sign a new contract.
Tell me, Mr. Smart, how did you know there was no bullet in that gun?
That was really quite simple, my friend.
You see, I happen to know that this is an XK-13074112802 Luger, and it only fires six shots.
Well, that's odd, Max.
I counted only five.
Don't be ridiculous, Chief.
There were definitively six shots squeezed off.
I happen to know my guns.
What I don't know is my arithmetic.
Well, Max, the KAOS agents involved are either dead or behind bars, and we've located the rest of the counterfeit money in those coin lockers at the bus depot.
- You forgot one thing, Chief.
- What's that?
You came to terms with the GSCA.
Yes, and don't think I'm not grateful.
Now we can forget about unions and concentrate on the real problems of CONTROL.
Not quite yet, Chief.
What do you mean, Max?
Well, Chief, as you know, female agents have problems too.
Some of them quite different from male agents.
What are you trying to say, 99?
Well, what she's trying to say, Chief, is that I have just been appointed head of the negotiating committee for all women CONTROL agents.
No, you haven't, Max.
No, no.
For example, Chief, take the little extra expenses that a girl has when she's trying to vamp an enemy agent.
Oh, new hairdos and facials and gold-plated revolvers - for evening wear-- - No.
Yes, Chief.
And how about the question of overtime for going around disguised as a man?
- What woman likes to dress as a man?
- No.
- With smelly cigars and-- - No.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
-  -  Max, it was very nice of you and 99 to take me out to celebrate my birthday.
Oh, it's nothing, Chief.
The CONTROL baker made you a very special birthday cake.
- We had it sent over.
- Oh, for goodness sakes.
- Isn't that nice?
- Pretty fancy, 99.
Now, let's see.
"Happy Birthday, Chief, from the gang at CONTROL".
I don't see anything.
It's written with invisible icing.
You see, Chief, we didn't want to reveal your identity.
After all, you are the head of a top secret organization.
Good thinking, Max.
-  - Oh, this must be the entertainment.
Look, Chief, this should be fun.
It's a magician.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
I am Siegfried the Great.
I am here tonight to prove that the hand is quicker - than the eye.
-  I will perform and you will enjoy.
I shall now perform one of my most brilliant tricks.
I need a volunteer from the audience.
How about you, sir?
You look like a man of imagination and daring.
I think he means me, Chief.
A man who is not afraid to face the terrors of the unknown.
I think he means you, Chief.
Have some fun.
It's your birthday.
No, 99.
I don't like to get up in public.
- Oh, come on.
- Go ahead, Chief.
- Yeah, all right.
- Just step up here, please.
Now, step inside this cabinet.
I shall now make this man disappear!
Audience: Oh!
Ooh!
Terrific, 99.
Really terrific!
Max, something's wrong!
- They're both gone, 99.
- Look, there's a note.
"KAOS has your Chief.
You'll hear from me.
- Siegfried the Great".
- We've got to get him back!
CONTROL will be paralyzed without him, Max.
I know, 99, but first we gotta find that magician.
That's just as important.
I wanna question him personally.
To find out what he knows about KAOS?
No, to find out how he did this trick.
Carlson: What's being done about The Chief now?
We have every available agent out looking for him, Professor Carlson.
Gee, 99, I'm really worried about The Chief.
- I hope nothing has happened to him.
- So do I, Max.
The Chief has never disappeared before.
Who's in charge of CONTROL now?
Don't worry, Standish.
It's all taken care of.
I've been prepared for a situation like this.
Just a moment, Smart.
You have no right to take over - The Chief's job.
- And why not?
I'm head of the agent section.
Well, I'm head of the lab section and Standish is head of the administration section.
And we have just as much right to be chief as you do.
- Especially me!
- Now, wait a minute!
Hold it, hold it, Standish.
We can't stand here and argue about it all day.
Let's stop this bickering!
There's a very simple and intelligent way to handle this thing.
After all, there are official procedures, you know?
- Good, Max.
- Now, this is the way we'll handle it-- I'll think of a number from one to 10.
Now, if either of you guess the number, you are chief.
If you don't, I'm chief.
Okay - Standish?
- Three.
Right.
Let's make it two out of three.
Smart, seems to me that only The Chief's superior can tell us who is in charge while The Chief is gone.
But we don't know who The Chief's superior is.
There's only one man who'd know The Chief's boss.
- 99, I've gotta go right to the top.
- Max, you can't call him.
I've got to.
Hello, this is Maxwell Smart of CONTROL.
I'd like to speak to-- oh no.
No, no, no, no.
Don't disturb him.
I'll call back later.
Thank you.
Can't bother him now, 99.
He's having an emergency meeting at his ranch.
- Top diplomatic conference, huh?
- No, it's roundup time.
Max, I know.
Let's check the secret compartment in The Chief's desk.
Maybe the name of his boss is in there.
Good idea, 99.
-  -   In case anything happens to me, contact my superior-- Zebra 6-4-2.
We're gonna have to look this up in The Chief's special codebooks, 99.
Zebra-- that's the blue book.
The blue book is the one with the green cover.
Since when does a blue book have a green cover?
Max worked it out with the coding section.
In case of a KAOS infiltrator, every book has a cover identity.
You simply have a cover for a cover.
It says, "See green book".
The green book is the one with the blue cover.
Max couldn't throw away a perfectly good book cover.
Ah, here it is.
It looks like it's in code.
It says, "Baker Able.
See telephone book".
Where's the telephone book?
The telephone book is right here by the telephone.
Able Baker, Able Baker, Able-- uh, here it is.
The name of The Chief's superior is - "Abel Baker".
- Call him, Max.
-  - Maybe he's calling us.
Uh, this is Maxwell Smart.
Smart?
Siegfried the Great.
I will return your Chief, but there's something I want in exchange.
I would like to meet with you.
I'm not meeting you with you, Siegfried, until I know The Chief is all right.
How do I know he's still alive?
I will let you talk to him.
- Hello, Max, this is The Chief.
- Are you all right, Chief?
- Yeah, I'm all right.
- Wait a minute, how do I know you're really The Chief?
You could be someone impersonating him.
- Max!
- It's The Chief all right.
Max, don't bargain with KAOS.
I'm expendable.
My life-- - Smart?
- What happened?
Your Chief was just silenced by a pistol butt!
That's a little drastic, isn't it, Siegfried?
Couldn't you have just shushed him?
We don't shush here!
I will finish your conversation for him when we meet.
One hour from now, at the southeast corner of Potomac Park-- just the two of us.
I'm going to meet Siegfried.
- You're not going to meet him alone.
- Yes, I am.
No, Max, he's a KAOS man, A thief, a kidnapper, maybe a killer.
just have to go on trust.
Maxwell Smart?
- Siegfried the Great?
-  - What was that?
- I think I just broke my shoe phone.
Shall we proceed with our little talk?
Just a moment, Siegfried.
- Are you armed?
- Of course not.
What's the matter, don't you trust me, Smart?
That's the way you come to a peaceful meeting.
You oughta be ashamed of yourself, Siegfried.
How could you be so sneaky-- And treacherous?
I suggest we check all weapons.
Good idea.
- My revolver.
- My revolver.
My machine pistol.
Come on, Siegfried.
My machine pistol.
My switchblade knife.
I don't have a switchblade knife.
- Here, I have an extra one.
- Thank you.
My brass knuckles.
My brass knuckles.
And my XKE500.
I have never seen a weapon like this before.
- May I?
- Be my guest.
It shoots dumdum bullets.
It can rip a hole on a man the size of an ashcan cover.
Nasty little weapon!
CONTROL issue?
Don't be silly, CONTROL would never issue a weapon as vicious as this.
I got it from a mail-order house in Chicago.
Well, that's it.
Careful, that's my exploding wallet.
Where's yours?
I must have left it in my other pants.
Here, I have my suicide pill.
It's raspberry this month.
- Wanna try it?
- No, thanks.
- Go ahead, it's not habit-forming.
- No!
Where's your suicide capsule?
This is my suicide ring.
I will have to keep it on.
A suicide wedding ring?
- How does that work?
- Through my wife.
She told me if I ever take it off, she will kill me.
All right, enough of this, Siegfried.
Let's get down to business.
- What's your proposition?
- If you wish to get your Chief back, You will deliver to me the X11.
The X-- the X11?
!
That's out of the question, Siegfried!
I can't give you the X11!
No, sir!
No X11!
By the way, Siegfried, what is the X11?
Your country's latest defense device!
Oh you know what I think, Siegfried?
I don't think you even know what the X11 is.
The X11 is an all new laser-powered missile detector.
It's 12"x14"x4".
It's completely portable, weighing only two lbs.
, eight and a half ounces.
And there are exactly three of them existence-- one being in the safe in your Chief's office!
If you're so smart, how come you lost two world wars?
You have my deal, Smart.
Deliver one X11 to me and I will deliver one live CONTROL Chief to you.
Agreed?
Agreed.
Where and when?
Right here, one hour from now.
Better make that two hours.
It will take us an hour to put all this junk away.
Think we'll get away with it, Max?
I certainly hope so, for The Chief's sake.
Smart!
-  -  Did it again.
- Did you bring The Chief?
- Ja!
Did you bring the X11?
Yes, I have it right here.
Throw it to me.
Now you throw me The Chief.
-  - You did it, Max.
Yes, I gave him a dummy X11, and he gave me a dummy Chief.
Yes, Siegfried, I understand perfectly.
What did he say, Max?
He says that unless I deliver the real X11 to him within two hours, he's going to kill The Chief.
What are you going to do, Max?
We can't exchange the X11 for The Chief.
No, but we can exchange the most important man in KAOS for him-- - Karl Danker.
- Their number one assassin.
- Yes.
- But how are we going to do that, Max?
We don't have Karl Danker.
We will, 99.
I'm going out and find him and bring him in.
Oh, Max, please be careful.
Karl Danker has killed and avoided capture every time.
He's tricky and shows no mercy, Max.
You'll be in extreme danger every minute.
And loving it.
Danker, freeze right where you are.
All right now, turn around slowly.
Well, Danker, I finally got you.
You've escaped capture by CONTROL 19 times.
They told me 19.
Smart's right behind me.
Catch him as he comes in.
-  - Sorry about that, fathead.
You better give up.
This building is surrounded by 40 CONTROL agents!
Would you believe 30?
- One angry boy scout?
-  - Girl scout?
-   Now you're gonna get it the hard way.
Have you ever used one of those things before, Danker?
- No.
- Well, why don't I come back a little later, after you've had a chance to practice?
There's not gonna be any later.
This is your last chance, Danker.
You wanna be friends?
Hold it!
Uh, listen, I-- I hope I wasn't out of line with that crack about fathead.
Well, fella, I guess it's just not your day.
Well, 99, I have Danker safely tucked away in security.
Good work, Max.
Siegfried hasn't called yet.
-  - That must be him.
- Hello, Smart here.
- This is Siegfried.
Are you going to give me the X11, or does your your Chief die?
Neither.
You give me back The Chief and I'll give you back Karl Danker, your number one killer.
I just captured him.
Well, this puts a crimp in my plans.
Now you have our top man and we have yours-- it's a stalemate.
I wouldn't count on that, Smart.
Hello, is this the answering service?
Do you have kidnapping messages for Maxwell Smart?
I already have that information.
Uh, what's your count?
Six of ours and three of theirs?
Oh, thank you.
Hello?
Oh, hi, 99.
No, we're doing pretty good.
I think we're ahead.
Yeah, we have 27 of theirs and they have 26 of ours.
Hello?
Okay, that's it, hold it right there.
Now, KAOS has 99, but I have you, Miss Dvorcheck.
And that puts us one up on KAOS.
Now, if Siegfried wants you back, he'll have to give us 99.
But I would rather stay here with you.
That's out of the question.
Well, of course these exchanges do take time.
Of course you know why I asked - for this meeting, Smart.
- Of course.
- We've both run out of agents.
- Exactly.
I have all the CONTROL personnel, and you have all the KAOS personnel.
Right, and it wouldn't do any good our kidnapping each other, because there'd be nobody left to do the negotiating.
Exactly.
Shall we start?
Okay, a straight trade-- our Chief for your assassin Danker.
Agreed.
Now, we give you back your lab man for our lab man.
Hold on, Siegfried, everybody in the espionage business knows that our lab man is the top man in his profession.
Then what do you want?
Our lab man for your lab man, and you give us $10,000 in cash.
This is ridiculous!
KAOS does not make cash deals.
Well, I have an alternate offer.
Let's see now we're a little weak in the administration department, so I'll tell you what we'll do-- we'll forget about the $10,000.
You give us your head bookkeeper and a minor accountant and options on two of your best garage mechanics.
This sounds fair.
We need some help in the coding section.
How about giving us Smithers in your deciphering department, and the first choice on the two best men graduating from your training school?
No deal!
We don't give away our trainees.
Forget it, Smart.
This could go on all day.
Let us wait.
Your Chief for Danker and we will get to the rest later.
Okay.
In one hour then, at our warehouse.
Hold it.
- Hello, Max.
Good to see you.
- Good to see you, Chief.
- Danker.
- Siegfried.
All right, Siegfried, how do we handle this?
- Release Danker.
- You release The Chief.
- I don't trust you.
- I don't trust you either.
- Are you armed?
- If you like, frisk me.
Now you.
Well, are you satisfied, Siegfried?
Very well, I will release The Chief.
And I will release Danker.
All right?
All right.
Okay, that's it.
And now just to show you there are no hard feelings, a little magic trick.
Hey look, Chief, it's a rabbit.
Observe this.
Hands up!
The old gun-in-the-rabbit trick, and I fell for it.
Up, up!
Well, Siegfried, magic is a two-way street.
Okay, Siegfried, it's my turn.
Big deal.
It's only a magic gun.
The old lighter-in-the-gun- in-the-rabbit trick.
You will now release the rest of my KAOS agents, and I will release the rest of your CONTROL agents.
- I don't trust you.
- I don't trust you either.
Okay, I've got a suggestion that will guarantee we both live up to the bargain.
- What?
!
- Hostages-- You leave Danker with me, and I'll leave The Chief with you.
Right, Chief?
- Wrong, Max.
- "Wrong, Max".
Okay, how about this?
I'll go with Danker and you go with Siegfried.
Do you wanna go with Danker?
I'll go with Siegfried.
Do you wanna go with Danker and Siegfried?
Well, how about me going with Danker and Siegfried?
Just you and I, huh, Chief?
The mass exchange seems to be going all right, Max.
Perfect, Chief.
Max: CONTROL Agent Harris for KAOS Agent Heinicke.
CONTROL Agent Blackhawk for KAOS Agent Bodie.
Mr. Standish, I would like to apologize for the blow to your ear when I kidnapped you.
I hope you didn't impair your hearing.
- What?
- Never mind.
Hi, 99.
Nice to have you back.
I'm sure it is, Max.
I just spoke to Miss Dvorcheck.
She's a liar, 99.
- Auf wiedersehen, Smart.
- So long, Siegfried.
And from now on, leave the spying to us.
Have we got all our agents, Max?
I think so, Chief, but I'll double-check just to make sure.
- Yes, they're all here.
- Then let's go.
- We can't.
- Why not?
Siegfried kidnapped our bus driver.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
- Christopher.
- Ah, Stromberg.
How was your flight?
Excellent.
Coffee to start with, sir?
Please.
Well, Christopher, is everything prepared for The Blaster's annual visit?
Yes, yes, of course.
What national building is The Blaster going to blow up this year?
The US Internal Revenue Building.
How magnificent!
It'll throw the American economy into complete confusion.
Another triumph for KAOS.
The Blaster will enter the country in the next 48 hours.
The building will be blown up exactly one week from tonight.
How is The Blaster getting into the country this time?
He's coming in with "The Lover".
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I got ashes in your coffee.
It's all right.
I'll get a fresh cup.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
There is a man standing behind you with a gun in your back.
I advise you to do exactly as he says.
So, our old friend Maxwell Smart.
Now, just a minute.
You guys are a little out of line.
I was just sitting here reading my newspaper and waiting for my lunch.
And listening in to a flower?
Isn't that a little bit unusual?
Not as unusual as what your friend's doing-- he's talking into one.
- Now, Mr. Smart - What?
I suggest you don't make a scene.
Just get up and walk to that green sedan parked at the curb.
But I haven't had my bacon and eggs yet.
How unfortunate.
But you don't understand.
If I don't have my lunch here, I can't get my parking ticket validated.
Start walking.
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.
- Woman: What happened to him?
- I think he's been shot.
- I didn't hear any shooting.
- Somebody call a cop.
- Get an ambulance!
- Somebody get an ambulance!
It's too late.
This man is dead.
Hey, Charlie, cancel the bacon and eggs!
Poor Max.
He was so young.
Yes, he was young.
And vital.
He was vital.
And intelligent.
Loyal?
Yes, he was loyal.
- Oh, poor Fang.
He's so upset.
-  Fang and Max were in the same graduating class at spy school.
Oh, Chief, please let me go after whoever did this.
I can't do that, 99.
I'm assigning you to a case that only you can handle.
What's that?
Antonio Carlos Carioca.
Oh, Chief, every time he comes in town all he does is stay up all night partying.
I know, 99, but he's a very influential person, and we can't afford to let anything happen to him while he's here.
Besides, he specifically requested that you be assigned to him again.
But Chief, I'm in mourning for Max!
I know, 99.
Maybe this assignment will be just what you need.
It'll help you take your mind off this terrible thing that happened.
I'm afraid I'm going to be a long time forgetting, Chief.
Max was someone special.
He had a way of-- of getting under your skin.
Yes, he certainly did.
Now, now, 99, I'll walk you to your car.
Come on, Fang.
I'll be all right, Chief.
wait in the car?
I'll be along in a minute.
- Right, Chief.
- Go with her, Fang.
Pardon me for intruding at a time like this, but were you very close to Max?
Are you kidding?
We were inseparable.
- Max!
- Shh!
Max, are you crazy?
You were told to stay in hiding until this was over.
Don't you realize by coming here you've jeopardized our whole plan for capturing The Blaster?
Some funeral.
Look at those crummy flowers.
They must have cost a dollar and a half.
What did you do, pick up an old corsage someplace?
- Max, it isn't important.
- It's important to me.
And another thing-- this cemetery lot.
Why isn't it up on a hill, Chief?
You know I like a view.
Listen, Max, for the past five years The Blaster has eluded us.
But this time we know exactly what he's going to do and when because you overheard their plans before they killed you.
You call that a headstone?
I've seen better headstones for parakeets.
Max, KAOS must remain convinced that you're dead or they'll change their plans.
Now, why did you take a chance and come here?
Because I wanted to pay my last respects to somebody that I used to be very fond of.
Judging from the turnout I'm the only one.
Where is everybody?
I don't know, Max.
I guess they just had something else to do.
Where's Parker?
Why isn't Parker here?
Parker had a previous engagement.
- Another funeral?
- No, tickets to a ball game.
Oh, well, that's a legitimate excuse.
- Carlson?
Why isn't Carlson here?
- Carlson has a bad cold.
I suppose he was afraid to come here and give it to me.
Very considerate of him.
Let's get you into hiding - before somebody sees you.
- Don't touch me.
I watched you during the services and you weren't even moved.
Max, you're not really dead!
But everybody thinks I am.
The least you could have done was sniffle.
Some funeral.
I was the only one who cried.
- Max!
- And another thing, Chief, about that casket-- what was that made out of, cardboard?
I'll make it up to you.
Your next funeral will be truly magnificent.
You say that, but you don't mean it.
And besides, I may not be around the next time to check.
Will you get to your hideout and stay there?
Chief, do you really think my coming here endangered our chances for capturing The Blaster?
It could've.
I don't think they recognized you.
I spotted two KAOS agents observing the services from their car, and they seemed convinced that you were really quite dead.
- Two KAOS agents?
- Yes, Stromberg and Christopher-- - the men who murdered you.
- They came to my funeral?
Who do you think sent the flowers?
That was very considerate, Chief.
It just goes to show you that you have to be murdered before you can find out who your friends really are.
I must remember to send them a thank-you note.
Max, please get going.
Chief if you don't mind, you go ahead.
I'd like to be alone for a few minutes.
I want to say goodbye to myself.
I admit these aren't very pleasant accommodations, Max, but we thought it would be safer for you to be hiding in a deserted building.
That's all right, Chief, I'm getting used to the shabby treatment.
It's only for a couple of days, Max.
Hmm, well, I didn't expect to go to heaven when I got killed, but I didn't expect this either.
Just have to get used to it.
Until we make our move, this will be your home.
Careful, Chief.
That's my favorite easy chair.
And watch your ashes.
The maid just finished vacuuming.
Max, cut it out.
The important thing is that you not leave this place for any reason whatsoever.
Just to make sure, I'm stationing Agent 13 outside.
It's vital that The Blaster be stopped.
We've stopped him so far, haven't we, Chief?
- No, we haven't.
- What do you mean?
Well, Max, this is classified information, but every year for the past five years, The Blaster has sneaked into Washington and blown up one of our national monuments.
A national monument?
You mean like the Washington Monument?
- Who told you?
- Who told me what?
There's nothing wrong with the Washington Monument.
I pass it every day.
That is a credit to the labor unions of our country-- carpenters, plumbers, electricians, stone masons, engineers-- everybody it takes to put up a building.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about a heroic workforce of 6000 men, all on emergency standby duty, waiting by their phones for a call from McClutzky.
- McClutzky?
- McClutzky, he's the foreman.
The Blaster always strikes at midnight, and within minutes the emergency call goes out to McClutzky, and he contacts his 6000 men.
Wow, he must have some phone bill.
on that bombed-out building, working without a break.
By daylight, the building was rebuilt without the public knowing - it was ever destroyed.
- That's amazing.
Haven't you ever wondered why the National Archives building - has been closed for almost a year?
- The Blaster?
Leveled it to the ground.
By the morning, they had the outside of it built up.
Do you know what's inside of that building?
- What?
- A vacant lot.
That's incredible.
And now he's after the Internal Revenue building.
He's gotta be stopped, Chief.
Yes.
If he succeeds, the records of every taxpayer in this country will be destroyed.
We won't know who's paid his taxes and who hasn't.
Well, that'll just mean that every taxpayer is on his honor.
This country could be in a lot of trouble, Chief.
At least we've got one thing to go on.
What's that?
You remember when I was listening to the two KAOS men?
One of them said The Blaster was coming into the country with "The Lover".
I've been working on that piece of information for two days now, and you know what?
- You've got the answer?
- No, I've wasted two days.
I've got to be going, Max.
Remember-- keep out of sight.
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Chief.
Oh, is there anything I can bring you?
Yes, a copy of "House Beautiful".
I'm thinking of redecorating.
Where do you think you're going, 86?
Oh, it's you, 13.
Listen, I just had to get out and stretch my legs.
You don't know what it's like being cooped up in a small room like that.
I'm sitting in a mailbox, and you're telling me I don't know what it's like to be cooped up in a small room?
I'd love to be cooped up in a small room.
I'd give anything to be cooped up in something as big as a small room.
Take it easy, 13.
Take it easy.
Every assignment I get I'm always locked in something small.
I'm always in a mailbox or a scale or a locker or a grandfather's clock or a tree-- do you know what happened when I was stationed in that tree - at that rubber plantation case?
- What?
I was tapped!
Try that sometime.
Try standing up all night with a spigot in your stomach!
Try to pull yourself together, 13.
I'll be all right, 86, just as long as that woman doesn't come back.
What woman?
The one who has the boy in the army.
Every day she sends him something.
What's so bad about that?
Today she sent him limburger cheese.
Phew!
You're ruining the neighborhood.
- Who is it?
- It's The Chief.
- How's it going, Max?
- Terrible.
I'm beginning to feel like the Prisoner of Zenda.
Tomorrow you'll be free because The Blaster is scheduled to blow up the Internal Revenue Building tonight at midnight.
Hmm.
Did you find out who The Lover is?
No, we're still trying.
Just in case, I've got McClutzky standing by.
How about 99?
How's she?
Under the circumstances, she's taking it admirably.
I'm not cold in my grave yet, and every night she's out on the town.
Max, you're not really dead, and 99 is on an assignment!
The least she could do is wear a black dress.
Tonight, Carioca comes to town-- Wait a minute, Chief.
Isn't it a little coincidental that when Antonio Carlos Carioca comes to town, it's always at approximately the same time that The Blaster makes his appearance?
Yes, we've thought about that, but it doesn't check out.
Because at the exact moment those buildings were being demolished, Carioca was having a farewell supper on board his yacht with 99.
And 99 is sure that he never slipped off the yacht for any long period of time?
She's positive.
How can you blow up a building when you're having supper on a yacht?
Maybe it is just a coincidence.
Don't worry about it, Max.
We'll get The Blaster.
Now, go ahead and eat.
I've got to leave.
What did you bring me today, Chief?
Corned beef from Irving's Delicatessen.
- Chief?
- Mmm?
I don't care what happens to me, but somehow, someplace, sometime, I'm going to put that man behind bars.
- The Blaster?
- No, Irving.
This corned beef is terrible!
Man on radio: On the lighter side of the news, millionaire playboy and dignitary Antonio Carlos Carioca bids our city farewell tonight and sails home aboard his new $2 million yacht.
Our news cameras filmed these exclusive shots of the custom-built ship anchored in the Potomac River.
The lavish new vessel is called the "El Amador," and boasts seven staterooms, three bars--  Did he say "El Amador"?
The "El Amador".
"El Amador" is Spanish for "The Lover".
CONTROL headquarters, Hobson speaking.
- Hello.
Let me speak to The Chief.
- He's not here.
Listen, Hobson, get this, and get it straight-- - it's top priority.
- Who is this?
Maxwell Smart, Agent 86.
Now listen, Hobson, I want you to tell The Chief that The Blaster is onboard Antonio Carlos Carioca's yacht.
Come on, quit stalling.
Who is this?
I'm telling you, Hobson, it's Maxwell Smart.
Tell The Chief the reason he hasn't been able to find The Lover is because "The Lover" in Spanish is "El Amador".
You see, Carioca named his yacht "The Lover".
But being Spanish, he painted the name of the yacht in Spanish-- the "El Amador".
In Spanish-- eh, wait a minute or is "El Amador" "The Lover" in English?
No, "English" is "Lover" in Spanish, Therefore the "El Amador" is Spanish for "English".
Ehh, or is "El Amador" English for "Spanish"?
Either way, call the Coast Guard and tell "The Lover" that The Chief and the "El Amador" are the same boat.
Well, it sounds like Maxwell Smart.
Hmm makes about as much sense as he did.
But you can't fool me.
Maxwell Smart couldn't be making this call because he's dead.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Here, you'd better let me take that.
- What are you doing in that mailbox?
- What mailbox?
Come on out of there.
You're under arrest.
I don't think you understand, Officer.
See, I just got in town and there wasn't a hotel-- If you don't come out I'm coming in!
Tell your story in night court to Judge Roberts.
Judge Roberts-- I think I got a letter for him.
Come on, out!
call headquarters and tell Hobson that-- He's been mailed!
Señorita, I do not understand.
Always you are so alive and gay.
This year you are so sad.
Everything I say makes you cry.
I'm sorry, Señor Carioca.
It's not your fault, though.
And stop calling me Señor Carioca.
Call me Antonio.
It is our last night.
What can I do to cheer you up?
Let me buy you something-- a dress, a diamond, a candy store.
It's just that I've lost someone very dear to me.
My-- my uncle.
I'll buy you a new one.
Come on, stop crying, please.
You are too young to cry, too lovely, too smart.
Smart!
What did I say now?
I'm sorry.
I'll be all right.
See?
That's better.
There is a saying-- "The majesty of a woman's eyes should never be diminished by the ignobleness of tears".
Oh, that's beautiful.
My father always said that.
He is 86 years old.
Why are you crying?
Papa is still alive!
He feels marvelous.
Here, I'll show you a picture.
Here he is on his favorite horse Maximillian.
My father calls him "Max".
Max!
What have I said now?
What are you crying for?
I loved him.
You loved my father's horse?
I do not understand what is going on.
Christopher: You can't go in there!
Max: Step aside, young man.
Oh, there you are, honey.
You forgot your key, so I brought it over.
I'm sorry, but she insisted on coming aboard and seeing her niece.
- I tried-- - It is all right, Christopher.
Inform Stromberg to start the engines.
- We sail in 15 minutes.
- Right.
Okay, Carioca, stay right where you are.
Or should I say, "The Blaster"?
Max!
Okay, drop it.
Sorry about that, 99.
Now whoever you are, remove your hat.
So you are still alive, Maxwell Smart.
How interesting-- and temporary.
You might as well hand over that gun, Blaster, because this yacht happens to be surrounded by the 7th Fleet.
I find that hard to believe.
Would you believe the 6th Fleet?
I don't think so.
How about a school of angry flounder?
So CONTROL thought if I believed you were dead I would proceed with my plan and they would capture me.
How naive you Americans are.
What do you mean?
I have already been inside the Internal Revenue building with the afternoon sightseeing tour.
I slipped away from the group, planted the bomb and rejoined them.
All that is left to do now is to set it off.
Oh, really?
Well, you're the one that's naive, Blaster, because that building happens to be completely surrounded, and you could never get near enough to set off the bomb.
But I don't have to go there to set off the explosion, Mr. Smart.
Back up.
Sit down.
You see, Mr. Smart, my bomb operates on the principle of high-frequency sound waves.
This lever controls the ship's whistle.
The first two blasts of the whistle are the same whistle sounds heard every day in the harbor.
but the third blast is on a wavelength that the human ear cannot detect-- a wavelength that will explode the bomb.
So that's how you blew up all those buildings without ever leaving the yacht.
Precisely.
And what more perfect alibi could I have than a beautiful CONTROL agent swearing she was having dinner with me at the time?
And you call yourself a gentleman.
Now, Mr. Smart, I shall pull this lever three times and your Internal Revenue Building will go up in smoke.
Christopher!
Smart!
-  - That's one!
-  - That's two!
You know, two against one is really rotten.
Don't move.
Don't move!
Missed me by that much.
Max, are you all right?
Yes, Chief, as long as I don't have to jump over that bar again.
- What happened to 99?
- She's all right.
She just fainted.
How did you know I was here?
Hobson contacted me.
After he hung up on you, he traced the phone call and found out it came from a shoe.
- Good work.
- How did you know The Blaster was here?
Simply by using my Spanish, Chief.
You see, "El Amador" in Spanish is "Lover".
And "Lover" in English is "El Amador".
So it figured that if The Blaster was on the "El Amador," that meant that Carioca was on The Lover, because "Lover" in Spanish is "El Amador".
And "El Amador" in English is "Spanish".
Oh, Max it really is you.
So you see, Chief, in that way he was able to set off the explosions without ever leaving the ship.
Absolutely brilliant.
We'll dismantle that bomb.
Then we can move all the tax records back into the building.
And to think that I sat here each time and actually watched him set off those blasts without even knowing.
It wasn't your fault, 99.
You thought he was blowing the ship's whistle.
Actually all he was doing was walking around the bar, looking at his watch, and then reaching up and pulling down the lever.
- Max!
- Max, don't touch that!
Relax, gang.
The first two only blow the ship's whistle.
It's the third one that sets off the bomb.
See?
Well, Chief, no use keeping McClutzky waiting.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
It's 11:00, 99.
- I better check in with CONTROL.
- Right.
Hello, this is 86 calling CONTROL.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
Come in, CONTROL.
Max, that's the cigarette lighter.
The radio's beside it.
Oh, thank you, 99.
The last time I tried to call CONTROL I burnt my tongue.
Hello, this is 86 calling CONTROL.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
Come in, CONTROL.
Yes, Max.
Oh, hi, Chief.
We've been watching Dobring's barbershop all morning.
Anything unusual?
Well, two congressmen, a supreme court justice and Senator Edwards went in.
Did you find out anything that we don't know?
Yes, Chief.
Senator Edwards wears a toupee.
Keep watching, Max.
We have reason to believe that that barbershop is a KAOS front.
Listen, Chief, I'm a little tired.
You know, I was up all night.
Max, this is important.
The man we suspect of being Mr. K, the top financial genius of KAOS, has been seen going into that barbershop.
Well, okay, Chief.
I'll stay on the job.
Listen, Max, if you're tired, why don't you take a nap?
I'll wake you if anything happens.
No thank you, 99.
I couldn't sleep.
When I sense danger, every fiber of my being is on full alert.
I understand, but let me know if you change your mind.
Chief, this is 99.
An armored car has just pulled up in front of the barbershop.
Yes, just a minute.
I'll let you speak to him.
Max, wake up.
Max.
Wake up?
I'm not asleep.
Where am I?
The Chief wants to talk to you.
Morning, Chief.
Max, what do you make of that truck in front of the barbershop?
Well, there doesn't seem to be anything unusual, Chief.
They're just making a routine delivery of a bunch of towels in an armored truck.
Doesn't it strike you as unusual that they deliver laundry in an armored truck?
Maybe they're expensive towels.
Max, it's obvious that they are picking up money, not laundry.
When the truck leaves, follow it.
Right, Chief.
I'll stay with them.
Max, have they noticed you watching them?
No, Chief, they're not at all suspicious.
Max!
Max, what happened?
Well, Chief, the truck got away.
But don't worry, I'm proceeding to the corner of 6th and Main.
Is that a CONTROL checkpoint?
No, it's a used-car lot.
We're going to have to send a man in to infiltrate that barbershop.
Now, if we can do it successfully, we'll be able to learn how KAOS finances their evil schemes.
Maybe they're playing the stock market, Chief.
No, Max, I don't think so.
It's much more likely that they get their money by robbery, extortion and blackmail.
You're probably right.
A lot of people don't trust the market these days.
I want you to both step up here.
I'm going to put a picture on and I want you to look at it very carefully.
Now, do either one of you know who that is?
- 99: No.
- Max: No, Chief.
Well, he's obviously a convict, but more important is his former occupation.
Hmm.
Well, judging from the little, beady, shifty eyes, I'd say politician.
No, Max.
Disc jockey?
No.
Jaywalker?
Safecracker.
Hey, that was fun, Chief.
Can we play another round?
Max, that is Jimmy Ballantine, the best safecracker the underworld has every produced.
He's so adept at opening locks that when he first went to prison they had to weld him into a cell.
- Go on, Chief.
- Thank you.
Now Ballantine is being released in a couple of days.
We know he's been contacted by KAOS, but we don't know what they want him for.
Considering his particular skill, it's safe to assume they want him to break into something.
How do we know this, Chief?
Ballantine told us.
He wants to go straight.
Then you want an agent to take Ballantine's place.
Exactly.
We planted a story to the effect that Ballantine was burned in a laundry accident in prison.
That will give us an excuse to disguise our man's face in bandages.
Chief, I'd like to volunteer.
It sounds like a suicide assignment, Chief.
I'd like to volunteer to find a volunteer.
Let's see Ballantine is 5'9".
Max is 5'9".
Ballantine weighs Max weighs 150 lbs.
Ballantine has a brilliant, agile, alert mind.
Oh.
Chief, I want this assignment.
I'll tell you right now, Max-- one slip and they'll kill you.
I laugh at danger.
They might torture you.
Well, that's the way it goes, Chief.
You laugh a little, you cry a little.
You are almost a perfect physical match for Ballantine.
Okay, Max, the job is yours.
But Max doesn't know anything about opening a safe, Chief.
Ballantine has agreed to give our man a crash course in safecracking.
He claims he can do it in a few hours.
Well, that's it, Chief.
I'm off.
All right, Max.
Oh, one more thing, Chief.
- What?
- Where am I off to?
Federal prison.
I'll meet you in the warden's office tomorrow.
Warden, do you mind if I lock the door?
This is top security.
Warden: Oh, I understand.
I must say I appreciate your cooperation in this matter.
Well, I'm glad to help out any way I can.
I am very impressed with what I've seen of the prison.
Thank you.
We try to keep the men here from being aware that they're confined, removed from the world in a prison.
How long have you been warden here?
Six years, three months, You must be doing an excellent job.
The men seem very well behaved.
Yes, we try to give them a little warmth and understanding along with the constant beatings.
-  - That must be Ballantine.
Just a moment, it's locked.
Ballantine, how many times do I have to tell you wait until I unlock the door?
Max, this is Jimmy Ballantine, the man you are going to impersonate.
Oh, glad to meet you, Ballantine, I'm Maxwell Smart.
Sorry, I don't shake hands.
In my line of work, I don't take any chances with my fingers.
- I understand.
- Why don't you two go in the other room?
There are several combination safes you can work on.
Come along, Ballantine.
Now, Max, you pay strict attention to what he says.
- Your life may depend on it.
- Right, Chief.
Yeah, use the bandages so you can get used to them.
Oh, I am used to them, Chief.
You haven't had much time to practice.
Don't worry, Chief, I feel like I've been wearing them for weeks.
Oof.
Sorry about that.
I hope it works out.
He's a very intelligent man.
Yes, 86 is one of our best agents.
I didn't mean him.
I meant Ballantine.
The secret to this whole business is in listening with your fingers.
- Listening with your fingers.
- That's right.
I'll explain the whole thing to you in a minute.
First, let's limber up our hands like so.
Now, this kind of work needs long, sensitive fingers.
They kind of run in my family.
I've got two brothers who are concert piano players.
That's interesting.
And you became a safecracker.
Yeah, somebody had to support them.
Okay, Smart, watch me work.
See what I mean, Smart?
I'm listening with my fingers.
That's fantastic.
This is like a piggy bank for me.
Mmm.
Listen, what are you going to do when you get out?
Going to be a TV repairman.
I thought you were going straight.
Okay, Smart.
You try it now.
Now, when your fingers hear the tumblers click, go in the other direction.
I think I better try my left hand.
My right hand is hard of hearing.
You ought to try some sandpaper.
Sandpaper?
Don't be ridiculous, Ballantine.
It would take years to open this safe with sandpaper.
On your fingertips-- makes you hear better.
Like so.
They feel sensitive now?
Well, three of them are sensitive, two of them are bleeding.
Warden, what time is Ballantine scheduled to be released?
- 2:00.
- It's almost that now.
- Better get Smart in here.
- How's it going, Ballantine?
To tell you the truth, not too good.
I was afraid of that.
If all safecrackers were like him, banks could keep their money in cardboard boxes.
Max: Ballantine Max, come in here, please.
I'm having a little trouble with this one, Ballantine.
Okay, I'll open it for you.
Max, it's almost time for you to be released.
They'll probably be waiting for you outside.
I'm ready, Chief.
You've been a lot of help, Ballantine.
Thanks a lot.
- You're welcome.
- After this case is over, I'll drop into your repair shop and bring my TV set.
If you live that long.
Let's go, Ballantine.
Now, Max, there isn't much time, so pay attention and listen carefully.
They'll probably take you right to the barbershop.
Ah, that's a bad break, Chief.
- Why?
- I just had a haircut.
Max, concentrate.
As soon as you find out what KAOS wants, call us on your shoe phone and we'll give you - the combination of the safe.
- Gotcha, Chief.
Now, 99 has gotten a job as a manicurist in the barbershop.
Oh, nobody told me 99 was leaving CONTROL.
The point is, she's been planted there to assist you.
Chief, could I ask a silly question?
Why bother giving us the combination?
Why not just catch us in the act?
Because we're letting them get away with the money.
Do I get to keep my share?
No, Max.
Now, as soon as they take that money, we'll follow them.
That should lead us to Mr. K, the head man of KAOS' financial section.
Now, Max, from the moment you leave this prison, you're Jimmy Ballantine, safecracker.
Your life depends on it.
- Good luck, Max.
- Sorry, Chief, I don't shake hands.
In my business, you don't take chances with your fingers.
Well, KAOS will never know that I'm not Jimmy Ballantine.
So don't worry about a thing, Chief.
Well, maybe you could worry that much.
Would you believe that much?
The B-89 can do at an altitude of 90,000 feet, but on the other hand, the ICBM-117 is 50% faster and 60% cheaper.
By the way, Dobring, what does "ICBM" stand for again?
"Intercontinental Ballistic Missile".
Of course.
I keep forgetting.
There you are, General.
You know what I like about you, Dobring?
You don't chatter away like most barbers.
You're a good listener.
Thank you, General.
See you next week.
-  -  Send this reel of tape to KAOS.
Ballantine.
Can I help you, sir?
Yes, I'd like a manicure.
Of course.
The name please?
Ballantine, Jimmy Ballantine.
Won't you have a seat, Mr. Ballantine?
Oh, Miss Evans?
Yes, Mr. Dobring.
Mr. Ballantine would like a manicure.
And be careful.
Before he left, your last customer needed a transfusion.
Sorry about that.
Miss Evans will take good care of you, sir.
I certainly hope so.
I have very sensitive fingers.
My, you haven't had a manicure for a long time.
I've been away for three to five years.
How's it going, 99?
Max, I think this barbershop is a KAOS clearing-house for everything-- money, information and agents.
- Ouch.
- I'm sorry, sir.
Is Agent 13 here?
Yes, he's in the back room, to the right of the water fountain.
- Ow!
- Ooh, I am sorry, sir.
I knew I'd be facing danger, but I didn't think it would be from you.
Everything all right, sir?
Yes, fine, thank you.
Oh, do you have a water fountain?
Yes, sir, right back there.
Would you excuse me for a moment, Miss Evans?
Certainly.
Where are you, 13?
Is that you, 86?
What have you learned?
I've learned to hate the spy business.
That's what I've learned.
All CONTROL does is lock me up in solitary.
I might as well be a KAOS man.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
I'm sorry, 86.
I didn't mean that.
It's just that when I signed up to be a secret agent, I thought I'd be shot or stabbed.
I never thought I'd be melted.
Easy, 13, just keep cool.
Well, that's easy for you to say.
Since I've been in here, I've lost 10 lbs and my ammunition is about to explode.
Listen, is there another entrance to this barbershop?
Could I trouble you for a glass of cold water?
Haven't you learned anything?
What have you been doing in there all day?
KAOS is planning a huge job.
That's what they need Ballantine for.
Oh, that's good.
After you've opened the safe, they're planning to kill you.
That's bad.
Well, good luck, 86.
Thanks, 13.
Keep your eyes open.
Yes, I try, 86, but I keep fainting.
Everything all right, sir?
Yes, I was just very thirsty, that's all.
Why don't you sit here, Mr. Ballantine?
Oh, Miss Evans, would you get me a bottle of hair tonic - from the back room, please?
- Yes, sir.
Here, Mr. Ballantine, let me make you more comfortable.
What happened to my customer?
He had to leave.
He just remembered a previous appointment.
How do we know you are the real Ballantine?
Well, who else would I be?
Who knows?
You could be a CONTROL agent.
-  - No, Rex.
I'll tell you when.
If you are the real Ballantine, perhaps you could answer a few simple questions.
Shoot.
That's only a figure of speech.
What was the date of the Brinks robbery?
January 17, 1950.
The take was $2,345,000.
Who was the last man elected to the underworld hall of fame?
Willie Sutton.
He was named on 91 % of the ballots.
What was the nickname of the man who drove the getaway car in the Van Allen heist?
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go ahead.
Is two out of three passing?
In this case, yes.
There was no Van Allen heist.
Welcome to KAOS, Ballantine.
Thank you.
What's the caper?
The vault in the Federal Reserve Bank-- $5,000,000 in cash.
Oh?
When?
lmmediately.
Can you handle it?
I think so.
For your sake, I hope so.
Popov will give you the details.
One more thing, Ballantine-- give me your shoes.
My shoes?
Why?
Don't you remember, Ballantine?
On your last job you slipped and fell against the burglar alarm.
Popov will provide a pair of tennis sneakers.
But these are my lucky moccasins.
Give me your shoes, Ballantine.
Now go get ready.
- Rex.
-  Don't forget-- after Ballantine opens the safe, shoot him.
I thought that would cheer you up.
Chief, I don't know what's happened to Max.
He was supposed to contact me on his shoe phone but I haven't heard from him.
Do you think something's gone wrong?
Knowing Max, I'm sure of it.
Were you able to find out anything at all?
Well, I had a few seconds to talk to Agent 13, and he said something about a bank job tonight.
If Max doesn't call, I can't give him the combination to the vault.
If he can't open it, they'll kill him.
What are we going to do, Chief?
We've got to gamble.
- Man: Yes, sir.
- Contact the Federal Reserve Board.
I want the vaults of every bank in the Washington area left open tonight.
Did you say "open"?
You heard me-- open.
The biggest bank robbery in history.
$5,000,000 for the KAOS treasury.
Are you sure you want to go through with this thing, Dobring?
What are you talking about?
Well, first of all, it's dishonest.
You have a sense of humor, Ballantine.
- Thank you.
- But I don't like it.
Open the safe.
Quickly, we don't have time to waste.
- Well, all I can do is try.
-  But if he bites me, I'll sue you.
Hurry, Ballantine.
Don't rush me.
I've got to warm up my fingers.
That's enough.
I'll say when it's enough.
-  - It's enough.
What are you doing?
Don't you know anything about safecracking?
I'm listening with my fingers.
Well, Ballantine?
Gentlemen, I've got a confession to make.
He opened it.
You're kidding!
You know, you probably have distemper.
Why don't you see a veterinarian?
I'll take care of the money, Popov.
You take care of Ballantine.
Wait a minute, what's going on here?
Turn around, Ballantine, with your hands up.
I sure hate a crook who can't be trusted.
- Rex.
-  Sic him!
What happened?
Bulletproof bandages.
Max, are you all right?
Yes, 99, I think so.
But I've got a headache you wouldn't believe.
- So you are not Ballantine.
- No, I'm not.
I'm Maxwell Smart-- Agent 86.
How do you like that?
He did a lousy job.
Who?
Whoever gave you your last haircut.
Come on, Dobring.
Let's go.
We picked up Dobring outside.
We didn't get their mysterious Mr. K, but we've broken up their bank-robbing unit thanks to you, Max.
You know something, Chief?
I still can't get over the fact that you were prepared to let them get away with $5,000,000.
Well, it wasn't much of a risk, Max.
Here, look at this.
This is one of the bills that they took from the vault.
A $1000 bill.
So what?
It's bogus money, Max.
- Are you sure, Chief?
- I'm positive.
That's funny.
Feels real.
Looks real.
It's even got a picture of President Goldwater on it.
Max Goldwater lost the election by 17,000,000 votes.
Oh, yes, I remember now.
Missed it by that much.
Well, it's been a good night's work, Max.
I think we've broken the back of KAOS's financing system.
They'll have to think of some other way to pay for their evil schemes.
Think of it-- if we could dry up their money source completely, they'd be out of business.
Wait a minute, Chief.
If KAOS goes out of business, what happens to us?
Well, I guess the CONTROL organization would be out of business too.
There wouldn't be any need for us.
Well, that's okay for you.
You're an old man.
You can retire on your pension.
But what about me?
I don't know anything but being a secret agent.
What are you trying to say, Max?
Well, maybe we can get together and give KAOS enough money to keep going for a few years.
Max, that's a ridiculous notion.
That would be like the police cooperating with organized crime.
How would you like that?
Well, it seems to work in the major cities.
Look, Max, help me take the rest of these bags into the vault and we can all go home.
I'm sorry, Chief.
I can't lift any of that heavy stuff.
I have to be very careful of my sensitive fingers.
There may be a whole career for me as a professional safecracker.
Tell him, 99.
Tell me what?
Max, you didn't open that vault.
What are you talking about, 99?
Of course I opened that vault.
What do you think, the bank left the door open?
Yes, Max.
That's exactly what happened.
Oh, really?
Well, I'll just show you that I can open any safe.
I have a hunch that's The Chief.
Max, you've got to get him out of there.
Don't worry, 99.
I'm used to dealing with big babies like this.
I'll have him out in two shakes of a lamb's tail.
Would you believe three shakes?
Max, we can't leave him in there overnight.
There's not enough air.
He'll suffocate.
Wait a minute, 99, he's using code.
At least we can communicate with him.
What did you say, Max?
I asked him how long he could hold his breath.
Chief, watch your language.
There's a lady outside!
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Woman on P.A.: Flight number 103 from Los Angeles arriving at gate 3.
- Doctor, don't move a muscle.
- Why not?
That's a fountain pen you're holding.
You security men don't miss a thing, do you?
All public buildings are supplied with ballpoint pens, not fountain pens.
It takes a trained eye like mine to detect a thing like this.
One tap with this point and you could have been blown to bits!
Now watch carefully while I remove the detonator.
Now, do you know what we're going to find in this rubber tube?
Ink?
Right.
We'd better get out of here fast because that ink might activate the paper.
Come on, Doctor, let's go.
Now in exactly three and a half minutes you'll be onboard that plane and my job will be finished.
In the meantime, just relax and I'll contact headquarters.
Hello.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
Come in, CONTROL.
Hello, Chief?
This is 86.
- What is it, Max?
- Mission XYX-03 - just about completed.
- What do you mean, "just about"?
Isn't Dr. Pliny on the plane?
No, Chief, but he will be in exactly one minute and 40 seconds.
Then call me back in exactly one minute and 41 seconds.
Come on, Chief, don't tell me that you're still worried about Dr. Pliny.
After all, he is in my protective custody, and I've got agents stashed all over the terminal.
I'll be with you in a minute, Doctor.
Max, I have a strange feeling that Dr. Pliny is in danger.
Don't be silly, Chief.
We're standing right near the boarding ramp and Dr. Pliny is right beside me on the floor.
Max, is Dr. Pliny in trouble?
That all depends, Chief.
Depends on what, Max?
On whether his flight insurance covers being strangled in the terminal.
Nothing.
I'm on my lunch break.
A man has been murdered.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?
Not from 12:00 to 1:00.
Listen, 13, if you don't straighten up and fly right, I'm gonna see that on your next assignment you're put inside of an incinerator.
- Are you threatening me?
- Yes.
You can't do anything to frighten me.
Last week I was in a stove, the week before that in a chimney, - the week before that-- - Never mind.
Forget it, 13.
Didn't you hear or see anything at all?
No, I'm sorry, 86.
I didn't-- Hey, I got an idea.
Why don't you ask Agent 36?
- He's stationed in locker 39.
- Right.
Thanks a lot, 86.
Sorry about that, 13.
Let's get back to the murder of Dr. Pliny.
Did you bring the murder weapon?
Yes, Chief, I have it right here.
Obviously the work of The Choker.
- You know, Max, he's strangled 375 -  of the free world's top scientists and we've never even gotten an eyewitness account - of what he looks like.
- Or her.
- What do you mean?
- After all, Chief, The Choker could be a woman.
Well, man or woman, The Choker must be stopped!
Right.
Listen, Chief, I have to go down to the lab and check on something.
- I'll see you in a few minutes.
- All right, Max.
We may have an eyewitness, Chief.
That's the break we've been waiting for.
Who is it?
A cab driver by the name of Andrew Bubinski.
Send him in.
- Andrew Bubinski?
- Yeah.
What are you guys, some kind of spies or something?
Mr. Bubinski, can you tell us exactly what you saw?
I seen this mugger choking this old guy.
He was pulling on his tie.
- You saw this happening?
- Sure.
Didn't you think it was strange?
Look, mister, I work the night shift.
I don't think nothing's strange.
- Did you get a look at the assailant?
- What do you think?
- I was standing right there waiting.
- Waiting?
I thought after they finished they might want a cab.
What I'm trying to get out of you is can you describe the man.
If you want to make a buck, you gotta hustle.
What did the killer look like?
Well he wasn't too tall.
He was kind of pale and weak-looking with this long nose and black beady eyes.
- That's him.
There, there!
- Where?
Where?
That's Maxwell Smart, one of our men.
He's the killer.
I saw him.
Of course you saw me.
I was guarding Dr. Pliny while he was being strangled.
He had the guy pinned.
I saw it with my own eyes.
All right.
Thank you, Mr. Bubinski.
- He's got killer's eyes.
- I have not!
That'll be all, Mr. Bubinski.
- Sure you don't want a cab?
- No.
How about you, killer?
- Get him out of here.
- Come on!
That's some swell witness you've got there.
It's too bad.
We were counting on that man for a description of The Choker.
Hello?
Oh yes, 77.
What?
Oh.
All right, thank you, 77.
They checked the airport thoroughly.
They didn't come up with anybody even remotely suspicious.
Stymied again.
Only one plane took off after Dr. Pliny was killed.
- The Choker must be on it.
- Where was that plane going, Chief?
- Casablanca.
- I'm ready, Chief.
No, Max, not you.
The Choker might recognize you.
Not necessarily, Chief.
He was inside the locker.
- He might recognize your voice.
- But I can change my voice, Chief.
I can play any part.
Get a load of this-- No, Max, forget it.
I'll have to take you off the case.
But I've spent a lot of time on this case, Chief.
I'll arrange for you to take a little time off.
You need a respite.
Is that anything like an aspirin?
No, Max, a rest, a vacation-- a respite.
If there's anything I don't need at this time, Chief, it's a respite.
I personally want to avenge the death of my very good and dear friend, Dr. What's-his-name.
Max, you're starting on a two-week vacation immediately.
- Do I have to, Chief?
- That's an order!
Okay, Chief, okay.
But just remember this: you'll be left all alone without my experience and know-how.
You'll be making hundreds of decisions without my advice.
And loving it.
No, Carlson, I'm afraid disguise HB-61 won't work.
- She just doesn't look like a boy!
- Thank you, Chief.
But, Chief, the Oriental houseboy is the best disguise we've ever had.
Agent 39 used it to crack the Hong Kong smuggling case.
Carlson, Agent 39 was an Oriental houseboy.
- He was?
-  Try costume LD-813.
Hello, this is the Chief.
Oh, hello, Max, what is it?
Listen, Chief, I've been thinking.
Good, Max.
The vacation's helping already.
No, Chief, I've been thinking that the reason you're sending me on vacation is because you're not happy with my work.
Oh, put it this way: you're work's as good as it's ever been.
Oh, good.
Then I can go back on the case.
- No, Max.
- Let me put it another way, Chief.
Are you angry because of what happened to Dr. Pliny?
Why should I be angry just because a man you were protecting was strangled while standing right beside you?
Oh, then I'm back on the case?
No, Max.
Absolutely, positively definitely no!
Listen, Chief, if you're undecided I can call you back.
-  - Chief?
- Oh yes, 99, that's much better!
- It's lovely, Chief.
- But what's my cover?
- A vocalist.
- You're kidding?
- I've heard you sing.
You're very good.
- But I'm an amateur!
- You just turned professional.
Congratulations.
We're booking you into the Bent Parrot cafe in Casablanca.
The Bent Parrot-- the watering hole of the world's most notorious double agents.
Yes, a melting pot of criminals of all races and creeds.
- And the headquarters of The Choker.
- Right!
They have a policy of hiring offbeat singers.
I'm not offbeat, Chief.
I'm off-key.
You better not be, 99.
Your life may depend on it.
- Right, Chief.
- Oh, 99?
- Yes?
- Don't say anything about this to Max.
Oh, Chief, I wouldn't!
He'd be absolutely crushed if he knew I was taking over this case.
He might try to follow you to Casablanca.
That's why I'm putting him on a plane to Canada today.
Listen, Chief, why don't you join Max?
You could use a vacation.
Just imagine it-- an isolated cabin on a snow-clad mountain, just you and Max I don't understand, Chief.
You didn't have to drive me to the airport.
I want to make sure you get on that plane.
Why are you trying to get rid of me?
You're supposed to be a father to me.
All right, Max, I'm your father.
Now make believe you're a good boy and I'm sending you to camp.
- Okay, but on one condition.
- What's that?
- If I get homesick can I come back?
- No, Max.
- Gee, Dad.
- Cut it out, Max!
All right, do me one favor, will you, Chief?
- What?
- While I'm gone, keep the case open.
You know I can't make a promise like that.
P.A.: Last call for flight number 14, leaving for Quebec.
- Now boarding at gate 6.
- Have a good vacation, Max.
Emcee: And now, ladies and gentlemen, direct from the Boy-Boy Club in New York, we present for your elegant dining pleasure a songstress who needs no introduction, an enchantress of 1,001 nights-- I can see you're impatient to meet her, so without any further delay, - here she is!
-    Pardon, monsieur, are you perhaps an American tourist?
Tremendous guess!
You are dressed a little strangely.
After all, the temperature here is 101°.
Oh really?
Well, I find it quite chilly.
I find that hard to believe, monsieur.
Would you believe comfortably cool?
I don't think so.
How do the words "heat prostration" grab you?
Hello, long distance?
I want to call Washington, D.C. Operator: You can now dial Washington direct.
The area code is 202.
Operator, the light is a little dim in here.
I wonder if you'd mind dialing it for me?
- Yes, sir.
- The number is 547-2791.
Thank you, sir.
That will be 75 dihars for the first three minutes, please.
Operator, I'm dialing from my shoe.
Is that a private shoe or a pay shoe?
- Private.
- Under what name is the shoe listed?
- Maxwell Smart.
- Thank you, sir.
I will connect you.
- Hello, Chief?
- Max!
Nice to hear from you.
How's the weather up there among the big pines?
Uh, a little warmer than we expected, Chief.
Don't give up, Max.
Maybe tonight you'll have a nice snowstorm.
Uh, I doubt that very much, Chief.
Oh, Chief, by the way, how is 99?
She's fine, Max.
Oh.
Uh Is she there?
I mean in Washington?
Sure, Max.
She's right in the next room working.
- You want to talk to her?
- No, that's all right, Chief.
- Just tell her I said hello.
- Okay, I'll do that.
Chief, you remember our conversation when we decided The Choker might be a woman?
Yes, Max, but forget The Choker.
Just enjoy your vacation and try not to get frostbite.
That I can promise you, Chief.
- Hello?
- Chief, 99.
Hello, 99.
Trouble?
Well, not exactly, Chief.
But there's a man here in Casablanca that looks exactly like Max.
It couldn't possibly be Max.
He's in Canada.
I put him on the plane myself.
You're absolutely certain that he's in Canada, Chief?
Absolutely certain, 99.
He called me from there not five minutes ago.
Hmmm.
Chief do you remember the cab driver?
Remember he said he saw Max kill Dr. Pliny?
Maybe this man who looks like Max is really The Choker.
I think you're right, 99.
- Shall I put Plan 7 into action?
- Right away, 99.
Oh, and one other thing, 99-- The man you're dealing with is a deadly assassin.
Don't let the fact that he looks like Max slow your reflexes.
If he makes one questionable move I'll know it's not Max.
Where have you been?
I've been waiting for you all night.
Are you talking to me?
- You sound strange.
You have a cold?
-   No, I'm all right.
What's up?
I want guns and ammunition.
I'll pay your price, no questions asked.
Well, not so fast, fat man.
First we'll have a few beers and we'll listen to the music, - then we'll talk business.
- I need the guns immediately - to overthrow the government.
- Which government?
What's the difference as long as we make a profit?
Yes, well, I gotta go along with you on that.
Contact me within 12 hours.
I shall be waiting for your call.
Did you get the information?
Look, buster, you know what's gonna happen if Sophia sees me talking to you?
He's gonna slap my teeth out and kick me in the stomach for mumbling.
Now get lost.
Ladies first.
- Ladies ask.
- Light me.
Look, why don't you let me order you a ham sandwich?
Are you fighting me?
All right, baby, I don't know what your game is, but whatever it is, let's get to the part where we put our cards on the table.
I've gotta talk to you.
Okay, you've got two minutes.
Start talking.
I can't talk to you here.
Come to my dressing room in about five minutes.
All right, what am I gonna get in your dressing room - That I can't get here?
- Me.
- Play it again, Sam.
- My name ain't Sam.
Don't confuse me.
I'm new in Casablanca.
Put your hands up very slowly.
Now maybe I can help you.
What are you looking for?
Well, I could say the Maltese Falcon, but you'd never believe me.
Back up.
Stand still.
Now are you or are you not Max?
Max who?
Maxwell Smart.
- I could ask you the same question.
- Ask it.
Are you or are you not Maxwell Smart?
If you are Maxwell Smart, you'd better speak up fast before it's too late.
I am no more Maxwell Smart than you are 99.
Max!
Max, I thought it was you, but you're supposed to be in Canada.
Well, I thought that you were in Washington.
Oh, Max, I feel so much better now that you're here.
Look, let me get out of this and we'll compare notes.
What have you found out so far?
Nothing much, Max.
I've been concentrating on you.
Frankly, I think this is a wild goose chase.
I think The Choker is 5000 miles from here.
I don't know.
I don't think so.
-  - He's probably closer than we think, possibly right under our noses.
Maybe after we get to know some of those characters in the bar Max?
No!
Max, you're all right!
Yes.
He fell for the old false-neck trick.
And this is what saved your life, eh, Max?
- Right, Chief.
- And you, 99, you did a particularly fine job.
Oh, thank you, Chief.
I enjoyed every minute of it.
And you know something?
I think blondes do have more fun.
This false neck is an ingenious device, Max.
Who made it for you?
The Ingenious Device Department, Chief.
- Oh, of course.
- You see, I first had the idea about three weeks ago when the laundry sent back my shirts with too much starch in the collar.
Tell me, Max, how did you know that the singer at the Bent Parrot was really 99?
Well, after all, Chief, I am a trained agent.
Nothing gets by me but the wind.
The first thing I noticed was her walk.
It's very hard to disguise a walk.
Then there are certain vocal characteristics.
Speech patterns, eh, Max?
Right, Chief.
You know what really gave her away?
- The way that she said two words.
- What were they?
She said, "I'm 99".
But what if I hadn't said anything, Max?
Well, there are other methods, 99.
For example, there's smell.
As I stand here right now, I'm taking notice of that cologne that you're wearing-- seductive, subtle, feminine, mysterious.
But, Max, I'm not wearing any cologne.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Sit down please, gentlemen.
I want to brief you on this situation as soon as possible.
- Where's Agent 86?
- He hasn't checked in yet.
We'll have to proceed without him.
We don't have much time, and I've already been fully briefed.
Can I check out some weapons?
Oh, of course.
Use the special weapons closet.
- Chief, who was that man?
- This mission is so important that even his number is top secret.
- Is he new in CONTROL?
- No, he's from our European section.
Now, gentlemen, please listen carefully.
KAOS has cracked our universal code.
All secret communications will have to stop until a new code can be delivered to our communications center in Greenland.
Agent X has been selected to deliver that code.
Why him?
Why not one of us?
Because KAOS probably knows all of you.
- We're counting on that to help us.
- How?
By seeing to it that they capture the wrong man.
Our real courier, Agent X-- a man whose face they're unfamiliar with-- will leave for Greenland with the new code tomorrow morning.
At the same time we'll be sending out another man as a decoy.
Exactly.
The decoy will be captured by KAOS and probably tortured, but that will give Agent X the time he needs to complete his mission.
I'm sorry I'm late, Chief, but I was stuck in the car - for almost 20 minutes.
- I know, 86, the traffic.
No, the seat belt.
I can never get that darn thing unbuckled.
Max, sit down.
I'll fill you in as we go along.
Right, Chief.
Gentlemen, we are now under special class-A top security.
We've got to do everything we can to protect Agent X. KAOS will do everything they can to eliminate him.
- Max, you know who that is?
- He's probably a KAOS assassin - out to get our Agent X. - Max, that's Agent X!
He must be from our European section.
I can't understand a word he's saying.
Sorry about that.
That's it, gentlemen.
If everything goes according to schedule, Agent X will reach Greenland with the new code at 5:00 PM tomorrow.
Good man Agent X. Sucker for a right cross to the stomach, but good man.
Please, Max.
You four men are the only available agents.
One of you will have to act as a decoy.
What if KAOS finds out it's a decoy?
What'll they do to him?
- They'll probably kill him.
- Huh talk about sore losers.
That's what makes this assignment so difficult for me.
I'm going to have to send one of you men on what may very well be a suicide mission.
- Agent 58, are you married?
- Yes, sir.
- Children?
- Four, sir.
- Agent 58?
- I have three children, sir.
- Agent 71?
- 17, sir.
- What?
- I'm Agent 17, sir.
Oh yes, of course.
I have two children.
I can't bring myself to pick a family man.
I'm asking for a volunteer, a man with no responsibilities, no wife, no children.
I hope there's someone standing behind me.
You know, Chief, you've got a lot to learn about asking for volunteers.
We did a study in depth on the subject of torture.
We found if you're familiarized with what you will have to undergo, - you'll be able to withstand it longer.
- That makes sense.
Say, what is this thing over here?
This is a rather primitive instrument, but it's very effective.
Put your wrist in here.
-  - Ooh, I see what you mean.
- That's very painful.
- That's not it, Smart.
Just watch this.
"Don't wear wristwatch".
Now do you see this chair?
After the first few hours of torture, they'll ask you to sit down and relax in it for a while.
- But that's only a trick, right?
- Exactly.
Watch this.
"Don't wear new suit".
- Now if you step this way-- - that'll be enough, Carlson.
I get the idea.
Are you sure that KAOS has all these devices?
Oh, yes, it's standard equipment for terrorist organizations.
Well, where did you get these?
From the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
Before we go into my office, I want you to know that it was bugged by KAOS a little while ago.
Right, Chief.
Bugged by KAOS?
Bugged by KAOS, but how could that happen, Chief?
We let it happen.
We want them to listen in.
That's the way we're gonna trick them into believing that you are the new courier who's gonna deliver the new code.
Oh, I get you.
I get you.
While they're listening in, I very cleverly identify myself as the courier with the new code.
Exactly.
Now remember, Max, try to make it sound conversational and natural.
Don't worry about me, Chief.
I happen to be a pretty fair actor.
Sit down, 86.
Thank you, Chief of CONTROL.
- This is a swell place you have here.
- Thank you.
What did you want to see me about?
The mission, Max.
Are you sure you have everything completely clear?
Yes, I have.
I will leave my house at 7:30 in the morning and proceed to the newsstand.
- Then I will-- - Do you have your airline ticket?
Yes, I have.
And the new code?
Yes, I will be having that in the secret pocket of my gray serge suit.
You'd better memorize it, Max.
We can't afford to let it get into the hands of those KAOS fiends.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, Chief.
Some of those KAOS fiends are probably nice, friendly, hardworking fellows like us.
Max, I will walk you to your car.
I mean, just because they're rivals is no need to call them fiends.
"Friendly, hardworking fellows like us"?
If it's all the same to you, Chief.
I'd rather they weren't angry while they were torturing me.
Is there anything at all I can do for you tonight, Max?
No, nothing at all, Chief.
Don't worry about me.
There's no torture invented that can make me crack.
- I'm impervious to pain.
- Good luck, Max.
- Aah!
- What's the matter?
Squeezed my pinkie.
"Cancel milk delivery, give Hugo the sweater, resign from Christmas club, make out last will and testament".
- Who is it?
- 99: It's me, Max.
Oh, come on in, 99.
- How have you been?
- Max, I just had to see you before  Come on now, 99.
Cut that out.
Now stop it.
I'm sorry, Max.
It's just that we've had so little time together.
It couldn't be helped, 99.
After all, there are no holidays in the fight against evil.
You're so brave, so dedicated, - so wonderful.
- I know.
- Max - Look, 99, it's getting kind of late and I have a busy day ahead of me tomorrow.
- I think you'd better run along now.
- All right.
do me a favor?
- Return these deposit bottles for me.
- Right.
Do you realize that we may never see each other again?
Well, that's okay, 99.
It's only 12¢.
You can keep it.
No, I'm home, stretched out on a nice soft bed like a normal person.
Of course I'm here!
Have you seen anybody around here that looks like a KAOS agent?
- No, I haven't.
- What are you so grouchy about today?
Because I didn't sleep a wink last night, that's why.
Every time I dozed off, somebody dropped garbage on me.
Will you please keep your voice down?
How'd you like to spend Listen, there are worse assignments than this.
I once knew an agent who was locked in a washing machine for three days.
- That was me, 86!
- Yes, I forgot.
I came out so wrinkled, I had to iron my skin.
Would you stop complaining?
I'm about to be captured by KAOS.
at the magazine counter.
Guy in the trench coat, dark glasses, reading the magazine.
Could be a KAOS agent.
Report my capture to CONTROL headquarters immediately.
Good luck, 8-- ow!
Sorry about that.
- Morning, Hugo.
- Little early, isn't it, Mr. Smart?
Yes, well, I'm out on some secret business.
I wouldn't want this to get around, but I may have a date in Greenland.
- Nosy character.
- Well, you get all kinds.
By the way, Hugo, here's a little something for you in appreciation for letting me read my horoscope every morning.
- A present.
- Yes.
I won't be using it much longer.
It's brand-new.
Hey, it's beautiful.
- Well, wear it in good health, Hugo.
- Gee, thanks, Mr. Smart.
Oh, by the way, in connection with that secret business I was telling you about, I may be gone for a few days, and I'd appreciate it if you'd pick up my mail.
The name is Smart, Maxwell Smart.
Capital "S," small "m," small "a," small "r," small "t".
Smart.
Like to look up your horoscope, Mr. Smart?
Oh, thank you, Hugo.
Now let's see.
"Scorpio".
Uh-huh.
"Good for business, meeting people and be prepared for surprises".
Hugo, what happened?
A little surprise from KAOS, Mr. Smart.
Of course.
The old gas-bomb-in-the-horoscope trick.
Come on.
Let's get going.
What makes you think I'm going with you?
The old gun-in-the-hand trick.
Good trick.
Come on.
Well, that's the last time I ever give you a sweater.
Come on.
Well?
You didn't find the code.
We searched him thoroughly.
Nothing.
You looked in the secret pocket of his gray serge suit?
Every inch of it.
Should I take Smart to the torture room now?
There will be no torture.
- What have you got against torture?
- In the first place, it makes too much noise.
We have more interesting methods.
- No torture?
- No.
Bring Smart in here.
No torture.
I don't know what happened.
This used to be a fun outfit.
If all else fails, we will use the new serum.
Yes, I am most anxious to try it.
I don't care what you say or do, - I'm not talking.
- We will see.
Sit down, Mr. Smart.
Well, you couldn't wait to get started, could you?
- What do you mean?
- You've already tortured my coat.
We have hours to go.
If Smart can only hold out till Agent X gets to Greenland.
Where's Agent X now?
Changing planes in Newfoundland, sir.
- You said that 10 minutes ago.
- The plane's been delayed.
- Delayed?
What now?
- Problems with the movie projector.
Good grief.
Any word about poor Max, Chief?
No, 99, not since Agent 13 reported his capture.
Oh, poor Max.
thing over and over again.
- Don't dwell on it.
- Liftoff from Newfoundland.
It's about time.
99, why don't you get a cup of coffee?
Right, Chief, but please let me know the minute you hear anything - about poor Max.
- I will, 99.
I wonder how he's doing.
- Who, sir?
- Poor Max.
The new code, Mr. Smart, what is it?
I'm not talking.
You can save us all a lot of trouble.
Trouble is my middle name.
- Let's torture.
- No, that is not necessary.
Mr. Smart is a reasonable man.
Are you not?
I are not.
Perhaps you would like a cigarette.
I don't smoke.
- A glass of water.
- I don't drink.
There must be something you would like.
Greta?
How about Greta?
Suit yourself, but I'm not talking.
We shall see.
Greta  - Well, Mr. Smart?
- I'm not talking.
I'm looking, but I'm not talking.
- Anything?
- Headwinds over the Atlantic.
What's the estimated time of arrival?
Still 5:00, sir.
- All right, 99, say it.
- I wonder how poor Max is, Chief.
What do you think, Carlson?
He's been under torture for three hours now.
He's probably close to the breaking point.
If KAOS finds out he's merely a decoy, they can still intercept Agent X. It's just a question of how much a man can take.
The code, Max.
Tell me the code.
- Please - No, absolutely not.
Please.
No, you can torture me all you like, but the answer is still no.
Oh, Max, please tell me.
I don't want them to hurt you.
Tell me the code.
No no no.
Enough!
Wait a minute.
I'll say when it's enough.
Quiet!
We will use the serum.
- Good good.
- This is the second time this month - you have failed.
- Wait a minute, Kimmel.
I think Greta did a swell job.
- Thank you, Max.
- You're welcome, Greta.
You were supposed to hug him and kiss him, not get friendly.
Out!
Untie him.
This is your last chance, Mr. Smart.
I'm not talking.
You may proceed, Seidlitz.
What's that?
An injection, Mr. Smart.
I hate needles.
You will talk?
No, I will faint.
What happens now?
This serum is a modification of thiopental sodium.
It will make you talk.
You cannot help yourself.
You'll recite whatever you've committed to memory.
Good good.
So you see, Luden, we must progress with the times.
-  - Wait wait.
- He's coming to.
- Get ready to copy down the code.
We will now hear what's in the subconscious mind of Maxwell Smart.
Two times one is two.
Two times two is four.
Two times three is six.
Two times four is eight.
Two times five is 10.
Strange, very strange.
What is this?
He's gone back too far.
He memorized that in his childhood.
But he will progress to the present very quickly.
Two times six is 12.
Two times seven is Two times seven is Two times seven is 14, stupid.
You and your serum.
Let's torture.
Right.
Notify security in Greenland.
I want an armored car waiting at the airport for Agent X. If Smart cracks, KAOS will be desperate to get that code.
- How long now?
- Two hours and 28 minutes, sir.
Two times seven is Two times seven is Kimmel, Kimmel, I've got it.
- What what what?
- This is no ordinary man.
This man is brilliant.
He's a genius.
- What are you saying?
- He has trained himself so thoroughly, that even his subconscious comes out in code.
Red Rover, Red Rover.
Red Rover, Red Rover "Red Rover, Red Rover".
let Barney Kaufman come over.
Let Barney Kaufman come over.
"Let Barney Kaufman come over"?
Yeah, now if we transpose the vowels in "Red Rover" and substitute them for the consonants in "Barney Kaufman"-- You and your serum.
Let's torture.
- What's happening?
- I'm having trouble with the reception.
KAOS may be jamming the frequency.
- I keep getting is Lawrence Welk music.
- KAOS has no mercy.
Wait a minute.
I've got Greenland now.
Control tower reports a perfect landing.
- Good, now if-- - Wait a minute.
There's more.
Agent X safely inside armored car.
- Mission accomplished.
- Oh, wow, what a relief.
Well, in a few moments CONTROL can resume normal communications - throughout the world.
- Now wait a minute, Chief.
What about Max?
- I'm sorry, 99.
- Don't you talk about Max that way.
- He's not dead.
- 99, it's impossible.
No man can survive what they put him through.
We don't know that for sure, Chief.
- I'm going to find out.
- You're wasting your time.
If you don't go with me, I'll go alone.
No no, wait a minute.
I'll go with you, but you've got to prepare yourself for the worst.
He may have cracked under that torture.
He may have the mind of a four-year-old.
He's still be the same Max to me.
A, B, C, D, E, F - G. - G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O P. This little piggy went to market equals x. Then this little piggy who stayed home equals y, and this little piggy who had roast beef must equal z. Stop!
Stop everything!
- I was just-- - Never mind what you was just.
Your brilliant genius is a fake, a decoy.
Word just came in.
CONTROL's new code has been delivered by the real messenger.
And you are responsible for our failure.
But I never knew a man who was so much in love with his childhood.
You know what you must do.
- I do.
- You will do the honorable thing.
- I will.
-  Luden, I am now in charge of KAOS.
- Luden: What about him?
- Finish him off.
- No torture?
- No.
Next time I say torture, maybe you'll listen.
Max-- oh, you're alive!
- I'm so happy!
- We didn't know what to expect, but 99 insisted we come for you.
That's all right, Chief.
You didn't have to do that.
I could have taken a cab back.
By the way, how did you know I was here?
We just took a wild guess.
Max, what you did today will go down in CONTROL history.
I still can't believe you're alive.
I'm about the only one who is, outside of Luden here.
We'll take him down to CONTROL headquarters for questioning.
No torture?
- All right, hold it.
Nobody move!
-  Why don't you watch where you're shooting?
- I got him, didn't I?
- Yes, right through my sweater.
Max, I just want you to know that what you did today was very brave.
No, not really, 99.
It's only what any well-trained heroic agent - would have done.
- Do you really think so?
I believe in, everything that I hold sacred is based upon my belief in the honesty and nobility of my fellow agents, and that belief is unshakable, unarguable and incontrovertible.
Of course, I could be wrong.
Still, Max, I don't think there are many men that would have faced what you faced today.
Well, 99, in our business, we have to be prepared to face capture and torture.
But how can you be prepared for that, Max?
Because, 99, pain is all in the mind.
It's all in the mind.
If you have control over your brain the way that I have control over my brain, then the body can feel no physical pain.
- I see.
- Mind if we don't talk about it?
- Why not?
- I'm getting a terrible headache.
Well, I'm off on vacation.
Oh, Max, two whole weeks.
I'm gonna miss you.
Well, two whole weeks isn't too long, 99.
Two whole weeks is only-- let's see-- there's seven days in a week.
Two times seven is, uh two times seven is, uh
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Am I going too fast for you, 99?
No, Max, I'm fine.
- Are we almost there?
- We must be.
It's gotta be around here someplace.
So this is the fabulous island of Tuwana, gateway to Hawaii.
What a spot for a vacation.
This is just our cover.
- We're here on a top secret mission.
- What is our assignment, Max?
I don't know.
Here.
Hold that.
I had sealed orders.
Max, you mean you haven't opened that yet?
But you know CONTROL procedure calls for the opening of sealed orders before arrival at destination.
Are you sure, 99?
I never got that in training school.
Of course you did, Max.
Don't you remember?
We were given a sealed envelope containing information about opening sealed orders.
- Didn't you get that?
- Yes, but I never opened the envelope.
Listen to this, 99-- we're to meet a Colonel Roger Forsythe, a retired officer of the British Black Watch.
He has some information for us about a KAOS plot.
- We'd better get on to the hotel.
- Right, Max.
- Here, let me take this, 99.
- Oh, thank you, Max.
-  - Careful, 99.
That's expensive luggage.
Hmm, this must be the place.
- Max: Oh, hi there.
- Oh, good morning.
Listen, if you're the hotel gardener, you're in a lot of trouble.
No, no, I'm Milton Conrad.
Welcome to the Tuwana Conrad.
- I'm the owner.
- Oh, that's very clever, Mr. Conrad.
You've named the hotel the Tuwana Conrad after yourself.
I'm sorry I can't see you to your rooms, but I have urgent business on the mainland.
- Are we on the hotel grounds?
- Oh, yes, this is the golf course.
The hotel is straight up the fairway.
Oh, you'll need this.
Thank you.
Sure is a sporty little course, isn't it?
Pardon me, I wonder if you could tell me where I could find Colonel Forsythe.
Right this way.
- Woman: Here, here!
- Come on, make a wish and don't tell anybody what it is.
-  -  I don't think he's going to get his wish.
Killed by an exploding birthday cake.
going on around here.
I've called the police as you directed, sir.
An inspector will be arriving from the mainland any minute.
Good.
Come on, 99.
We might as well check in.
Right, Max.
- Uh, do you have a room?
- Yes, someone just checked out.
You have a reservation for a Mr. and Mrs. Livingstone?
Ah, yes, Mr. Livingstone.
Your room is 104 and your wife is in 211.
May I ask a personal question?
Yes, but just one.
It might seem a bit presumptuous, but it's rather strange.
- What is?
- That you're in room 104 and your wife is in 211.
Perhaps you're right.
I'll tell you what, put me in 211 and put her in 104.
- What was that?
- One of the features of the island-- an active volcano.
Does that every hour.
- You can set your watch by it.
- That seemed rather severe.
- How close is the volcano?
- Oh, about 15 feet.
I'll see to your luggage now.
Max, this hotel gives me the creeps.
Exploding birthday cakes, volcanoes-- why would anyone want to come here?
For one thing, 99, you can't beat the rates.
I don't care what you say, Max, anyone would be a fool to come to the Tuwana Conrad.
Moment, please.
Do not deny implication, only resent it.
Unless I miss my guess, 99, that would be Harry Hoo, the famous Hawaiian detective.
This way, please.
Ah, Mr. Smart.
Miss 99.
Hi, Hoo.
How are ya?
- Not too happy, Mr. Smart.
- What's wrong?
To be too happy is to invite trouble from Hawaiian God Ki'nahora.
I see you've brought a change of clothes, Mr. Hoo.
Oh yes, found wonderful tailor in Hong Kong, Mr. Smart.
How come all your suits are exactly the same?
Oh, beg to differ.
All have different styles.
Oh, I guess all Chinese suits look alike to me.
Do you always wear white, Mr. Hoo?
Except in summer.
will you?
Go in and see that the guests don't leave the dining room till I've - had a chance to question them.
- Right, Max.
Ah, so, Mr. Smart, once again bird of death has brought us together.
Yes, and it's a little embarrassing for me, Mr. Hoo.
You see, I had an appointment with the murdered man.
Ah, tell me, Mr. Smart, - how was victim killed?
- By an exploding birthday cake.
Ah so.
That again.
- Again?
- Yes, becoming quite common.
In some countries it is considered crime to carry concealed birthday cake.
Tell me, what do you know about victim?
Well, his name was Colonel Forsythe.
He was a master spy who infiltrated the Japanese High Command just before the last war.
Ah, did Japanese ever suspect him?
No, no, he was too clever for that.
You see, he was able to divert suspicion from himself by personally ordering the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor.
- Amazing.
- The four suspects are waiting for you.
Correction, please.
There are not four suspects in this case, - there are seven.
- Seven?
But there are only four guests outside of Colonel Forsythe.
I am including you, Miss 99 and myself in this list.
You see, I have learned never to eliminate possible suspect.
In one case, I was suspect until very end.
- Did you do it?
- Of course not.
Murderer was oriental detective, all right, but was another oriental detective.
Well, that must have been a big relief to you.
- I'd better go check the grounds.
- Good idea, 99.
And while you're out there, why don't you have a look around?
I have gathered you all here to question you about the unfortunate passing of Colonel Forsythe.
Will you all please identify yourselves?
- Starting with you, sir.
- My name is Ben Gazzman.
I guess you'd call me an adventurer.
I go about the world drinking, loving and driving fast cars, trying to crowd as many experiences as I can into my life.
See, the doctor told me I only have two years to live.
When did he tell you that?
Do you have any questions, Mr. Smart?
Yes, Mr. Hoo, I'd like to know where you were when the murder was committed.
Not for me, for him!
No questions.
Amazing.
- And you, sir.
- I'm Arthur Von Werner.
I'm Swiss.
I'm a watchmaker.
And I suppose you were a neutral during the war?
I said I was Swiss.
I was never a neutral.
I was just taking the orders.
Sorry, but humble detective think you are lying.
- And I think you are a fool.
- Now wait a minute!
You can't talk that way to the world's greatest detective.
Control yourself, Mr. Smart.
As Confucius say, "Stick and stone may break my bone, but name will never hurt me".
- Confucius said that?
- As a child.
Now, Von Werner, what are your hobbies?
Watercolors, classical music und torture.
- I don't think he's a watchmaker.
- I have proof!
I designed already this very cuckoo clock.
Sieg heil!
Sieg heil!
- It's not 2:00.
- Don't argue with him!
If he says it's 2:00, you'd better believe him.
I still say he's lying.
Mr. Smart, let us not pursue it.
I still have relatives living in Switzerland.
Now it's 2:00!
Instead of prosecuting the Swiss, why don't you find out why an hour before he died he was drinking martinis with that woman.
That is a lie!
We were drinking Manhattans.
Ah so, that is most helpful, madam.
- You are?
- I am the Contessa Dorina Montenegro.
I met the colonel this morning and fell madly in love with him.
But it is always the same.
Uh, explain, please.
There is nothing to explain.
It is simply that every time I meet a handsome and dashing man, something terrible always happens to him.
Hmm, I'd better watch myself.
Amazing.
Now our final suspect of the evening.
I am Omar Shurok.
I'm Lebanese.
- I'm a spy.
- Ah so.
And on what country do you spy?
I spy on every country-- except Austria.
I promised my mother I would never spy on Austria.
Uh, why is that?
My mother is spying on Austria.
Mr. Shurok, does the name KAOS mean anything to you?
KAOS?
The international organization of evil?
Formed in 1904 in Bucharest, designed to foment unrest and revolution throughout the world?
- Yes.
- I never heard of it.
- I think he's lying.
- Max!
A storm's brewing, so the ferry can't reach us from the mainland.
- We're cut off!
- In that case, must insist that no one leave island.
some kind of a boat we can get to take us to the mainland.
No, Max, the employees took the boat with them.
They've all left.
And, Max, a strange thing-- - someone's cut the telephone wires.
-  Any further questions, Mr. Smart?
Yes, as a matter of fact, I do have some further questions, Mr. Hoo.
I'd like to ask each one of you one question.
Do you believe that Colonel Forsythe was what he said he was, or do you believe he was a spy?
Very well, let's begin the questioning with Mr. Gazzman.
I think he was a retired colonel.
Okay, one down and three to go.
Contessa?
Did the colonel perform a service?
I'm not sure, but I think he was self-employed.
Mr. Smart, I think this line of questioning will not be productive.
Suggest we all go to our rooms - and lock door.
Good night, Von Werner.
- Good night, Mr. Hoo.
- Good night, Mr. Gazzman.
- Good night, Von Werner.
Good night, Shurok.
Good night, Mr. Gazzman.
Good night, Contessa.
Good night, Mr. Shurok.
Good night, Mr. Smart.
Good night, Contessa.
Good night, Mr. Hoo.
Good night, Mr. Smart.
Good night, Von Werner.
Good night  - Let me try, Max.
- Don't be silly, 99.
If I can't do it, what makes you think you can do it?
You've got a lot to learn about male superiority.
Max, there's a storm brewing.
It's going to be very dangerous to try to row to the mainland.
I suppose so, but someone's got to get to the mainland and tell them that we're stranded out here with a crazy maniacal KAOS killer.
I guess you're right.
Goodbye, Max.
Goodbye, 99, and good luck.
For your information, Mr. Smart, I've arranged to meet Mr. Gazzman in the dining room.
- You mean to tell me-- - Yes, I believe we have our murderer.
Ah, Mr. Gazzman, the little game is ended.
You have been clever, but not too clever for Harry Hoo.
You have always been my prime suspect.
Until now.
- What is he saying?
- He says your knee is on his chest.
Sorry about that.
Is he still alive?
I don't know.
Better take pulse.
His pulse.
He's dead.
It is wisely written, Mr. Hoo, that dead men tell no tales.
I'll do the proverbs please.
Just search pockets for possible clues.
Okay, let's see KAOS identification card.
A white feather.
Black book with three names circled.
Ah, pattern is beginning to emerge.
A trained black widow spider.
- And a torn page-- - Wait a minute.
- What did you say?
- A torn page-- No, no, before that.
A trained black widow spi-- a trained black widow spider!
Exactly!
Familiar and diabolical method-- using trained spider to do killer's work.
Say, I've got a great idea, Mr. Hoo!
Why don't we get all the guests and form them in a circle and see who the spider crawls to?
Do you know what Mr. Gazzman's death means?
Yes, I do, Mr. Hoo.
It means that the exploding birthday cake can no longer be considered just an accident.
Amazing.
- Look at this, Mr. Hoo.
- What is that?
Just before Gazzman died, he scrawled the initials of his killer on this slip of paper.
Permit me-- "HH".
- That's of no importance.
- Wait a minute.
Herbert Hoover?
- Hubert Humphrey - Now, Mr. Smart-- - Hector Hernandez - Mr. Smart-- - Yes?
- I have decided upon method of trapping murderer.
Tonight at dinner you will make announcement that tomorrow morning you intend to expose killer.
Oh.
What good will that do?
Well, murderer fearing capture - will try to kill you.
- Oh, good!
Eh he will?
Well, that means that I could die trying to solve this case.
Mr. Smart, it is truly written you can't win them all.
Mr. Hoo, I did as you suggested.
I made the announcement at the dinner table tonight.
Now all we have to do is wait for murderer to strike.
- I'm certain he will appear - I hope you're right.
- and try to kill you.
- I hope you're wrong.
-  - Shh!
So it is you, Shurok.
You're the murderer.
- What are you talking about?
- First you killed Colonel Forsythe.
Then you killed Mr. Gazzman.
And tonight you tried to kill me - before I could learn your identity.
- I haven't killed anyone!
Oh no?
Then perhaps you can explain what you're doing here.
I was going to bed!
This is my room!
Mr. Hoo and I both agree that it is no longer safe for any of us to be left alone.
That way it would be too easy for the killer to pick us off one by one.
Yes, humbly fear that if we all stay together, killer will be unable to strike.
- Do you agree, Contessa?
- Yes, yes, of course.
- And you, Herr Von Verner?
- It's Von Werner!
Und I'm Swiss.
And you, Mr. Shurok, do you not feel that we will all be safer if we stay together?
Mr. Shurok has provided strong argument against my proposal.
Another murder.
How was it done this time, Mr. Hoo?
Perhaps poison needle, perhaps strangulation.
Providence has been kind.
Mr. Shurok was only napping.
Max: Yes, well, it is a little stuffy in here.
I suggest that we all go out on the patio and get a breath-- Moment, please.
- Is he sleeping too?
- Sleep that is endless.
Of course.
A pinch of casteroid potassium, a deadly poison.
I do not understand why Von Werner did not notice casteroid potassium in tea.
How could he?
It tastes like any one of a thousand other poisons.
Amazing.
Contessa, I'm going to keep my eye on you, and Harry Hoo is going to watch Mr. Shurok.
I feel so safe with you protecting me, Mr. Smart.
Well, I don't like to boast, but of all the hundreds of people I've guarded, I've only lost three.
Would you believe four?
Ah!
So, so sorry.
Another point for me, Mr. Shurok.
Oh, good shot.
Ah, ha, ha!
That's it, Mr. Shurok, game is over.
What happened?
He lost 21-17.
Another man murdered.
How horrible.
He wasn't playing well anyway.
Well, of course not!
He had an ax in his back.
Five people murdered one by one, and only you and I left alone on this island, Mr. Hoo.
Uh, let us not leap to conclusion, Mr. Smart.
Suggest we put gun on table and discuss case sensibly.
I am reminded of similar case in 1952.
one by one they died.
Did you find the killer?
Yes, it was typhoid epidemic.
Do you believe that there is a typhoid epidemic on this island, Mr. Hoo?
No such luck, Mr. Smart.
Find that all victims had one thing in common.
A bad travel agent?
No, they were all members of KAOS.
I found that they had one of these in each one of their suitcases.
A KAOS identification ring.
If all victims were KAOS agents, conclude that killer must be man with pathological hatred of KAOS.
You are such a man, Mr. Smart.
And since you are only man on island besides myself, - you must be murderer.
- Moment, please, Mr. Hoo.
You are forgetting one thing.
You are forgetting that when Gazzman died, he wrote the initials of his killer-- "HH".
And I've come to the conclusion that "HH" stands for Harry Hoo.
And since you and I are the only ones left on this island, then you must be the murderer.
So it did work-- down to the last man.
Not quite, Mr. Conrad.
Mr. Hoo, your hunch was right.
Conrad never did leave the island.
You see, he knew that all of his guests were KAOS defectors.
So he had to kill Colonel Forsythe before he could arrange for their passage back to the States.
Yes, Mr. Conrad was taken in by our little charade.
He counted on us killing one another.
He cleverly planted suspicion by leaving note marked "HH" by Mr. Gazzman's body.
Well, to tell you the truth, Mr. Hoo, I thought that "HH" stood for Harry Hoo.
Oh, please do not apologize, Mr. Smart.
You also suspected Herbert Hoover.
I don't understand!
I saw you shoot each other.
How is it you're not both dead?
Because we took the simple precaution of loading our guns with blanks.
Ooh.
In that case, gentlemen, put your hands up.
Amazing.
to see you.
Oh, Max, it's so lucky that I couldn't reach the mainland.
- I'll say it was.
- So Conrad killed Colonel Forsythe.
Yes, and a few other good people too.
It's a good thing you shot him.
- I guess I saved your life, Max.
- Not only that, 99, but now we can check out of the hotel without paying our bill.
Ah so, storm is over and another case is solved.
Do you see anything yet, Mr. Hoo?
-  - No, can see nothing.
with that luggage!
- I'm trying, Max!
- Why don't you help her, Mr. Smart?
Oh, good idea.
Here, let me take this bag, 99.
- Thanks, Max.
- You chop for a while.
Boy this vegetation really grows fast.
Any sign of boat yet, Mr. Smart?
No, but maybe we can see better when we get outside.
I think we're on the right path, Mr. Hoo.
Here's the front desk.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Quiet, 99.
One false move and we're dead agents.
We're a little behind schedule, Max.
The KAOS patrol is due in exactly one minute and 45 seconds.
Right.
You check the explosives.
I'll open the sealed orders.
Right.
break the seal.
Tear open the side of the envelope, Max.
There's no wax there.
Are you kidding?
You can't do that, 99.
That's why they put wax on the seal-- so that you'll break it open.
Max, hurry, we're running out of time.
You know something, 99?
If we ever get back from this mission alive, I'm going to put that in the CONTROL suggestion box.
- It's a great idea.
- What idea?
About putting wax all around the ends of the envelope.
That way you can tear it open anywhere and still break the seal.
- Give me your nail file, 99.
- Oh, right, Max.
Here.
I know it's in here somewhere.
Hurry, Max.
Only 40 seconds left.
the nail file.
Oh no.
- Ah, that did it.
- You got it open.
No, I broke my fingernail.
Now I'll have to find the nail file.
We can't, Max.
There's not time.
There's only 20 seconds left.
How many packets of explosives do we have?
- Uh, two.
- Good.
I'll use one of them to blow open the envelope.
What is it?
Sounds like a yellow-bellied sapsucker.
On the other hand it could be a giant toothless cockatoo.
Max!
All right, get up.
That will be all, Larrabee.
Max, this was only a training exercise.
Tomorrow you're supposed to go on the real mission.
- I'm ready, Chief.
- You're ready?
You just got killed!
I said I was ready.
I didn't say I was perfect.
Don't worry about opening those sealed orders, Max.
It was just a training session.
The mission will go ahead tonight as scheduled, sir.
Right.
Thank you for wishing us luck, sir.
We'll need it.
Max, never mind about the envelope.
I'll fill you in personally.
Tonight's mission depends on a split-second timetable.
It certainly is top secret, Chief.
We don't even know what the objective is.
We wanted to avoid security leaks.
A number of commercial cargo ships have been hijacked - over the past six months.
- KAOS?
Yes.
They've been committing piracy on the high seas using submarines.
We've discovered their base on an island not far from our coastline.
The key to the entire piracy operation is a master computer located here.
It evaluates shipping data, cargoes, tides, currents, and fixes the point of interception by the KAOS submarine.
- Then the computer is our objective.
- Correct.
Our submarine will take you to the island.
You'll have to slip past the KAOS guards, work your way through a network of land mines there, get to the computer and destroy it.
I like that plan, Chief.
It's inventive, imaginative and brilliantly thought out.
Max, it sounds like a suicide mission to me.
Well, of course it's a suicide mission, 99.
So what?
Our next mission will be easier.
After the mission you'll have to signal our sub where and when to pick you up.
There are powerful blinker lights built into those earrings.
Very clever, Professor Carlson.
Then if we get caught no one will suspect a thing.
Maybe I should wear the earrings, Max.
Oh?
Oh, right, 99.
They'll probably look better on you anyway.
Professor Carlson has another signaling device for you.
Now this looks like an ordinary fountain pen.
I see.
And you just press this lever to activate it.
- Max!
- What am I supposed to do, write the signal message on my shirt?
No, you press this button and the pen becomes a blinker light.
and draw the special equipment.
Max, you come with me for the rendezvous briefing.
Hello, gentlemen.
I'm sorry we're late.
This is Maxwell Smart, Agent 86.
Max, this is Admiral Nelson of the Submarine Command, Admiral Jones from Destroyer Command.
- Smart.
- Gentlemen.
- Shall we get right to the briefing?
- Right.
Smart, you'll be proceeding from the mainland at precisely 2100 hours.
The submarine will proceed southeast to this point-- You will rendezvous there with one of his destroyers.
Two destroyers.
Two?
I thought we agreed on one.
I felt two would be safer.
All right.
I'll just match that with another sub.
That calls for four more destroyers, John.
You're starting again, Horatio.
I'll just call those four destroyers and raise you four submarines.
You're bluffing.
Horatio, if you have any guts we'll make this a real rendezvous.
- No limit.
- You're on!
Well, Chief, this looks like it's gonna be a long session.
I think we'd better send out for some sandwiches and coffee and more ships.
- Welcome aboard, Agent Smart.
- Why thank you, Skipper.
We'll be shoving off in a few minutes.
Sorry, the men aren't accustomed to having a pretty face onboard.
If they like me, wait till they get a load of 99.
This way, Mr. Smart.
My apologies for your quarters, Smart, but we're short on space.
Agent 99 will be using my quarters.
I'll bunk with the executive officer.
Right, Skipper.
Want to check out the special equipment, Max?
No, I think I'll just rest for a while, 99.
You go ahead and do the briefing.
We have two Z-139 landmine detectors Two Z-139s.
And we have five packets of E-18 plastic explosives and fuses.
Five packets, gotcha.
And one TX-7 long-range explosive launcher.
Listen, 99, why don't you rest for a while and I'll do the briefing?
This is the spot, Mr. Smart.
We're ready to put you ashore now.
Max, this looks like a tough one.
Chances are we're not going to come back alive.
In case we don't, isn't there anything you'd like to say?
Yes, 99.
As long as I have to go on a suicide mission, I'm glad it's with you.
Right on the nose, 99.
Now we've got two minutes to get past the guards, four minutes to work our way through the land mines, find the KAOS computer and blow it up.
This may put us a little behind schedule.
We're sunk, Max.
We'll never complete the mission now.
Maybe not, 99.
I've got a plan.
Get ready to hit the dirt when I say now.
Oh, pardon me, but isn't your hand grenade loose?
No it isn't.
It's perfectly tight.
They must have heard the explosion, Max.
Yes.
In a few minutes there'll be KAOS agents swarming all over this place.
Come on, 99, let's get out of here.
Quick, Max, only three minutes to find the computer and blow it up!
Here, take this, 99.
I'll get the gun.
Hold it, 99!
We can't go through those bushes.
It's a minefield.
Why, any one of these berries could blow us to smithereens.
Even that log, Max?
Not the log, 99, but our fine feathered friend the bird bomb!
Can you deactivate it?
-  - Yes.
All I have to do is pluck it!
Quick, Max.
We're behind schedule.
We'll have to set up here and see if we can find the computer by map.
- Put her down there, 99.
- Right.
Now let's see - Why not, Max?
- This is a map of San Francisco.
Max, you can see the computer right through there.
Right, perfect.
It's about a 300-yard range.
- Load her up, 99.
- Right, Max!
Okay, Max, - fire!
-  Direct hit, Max, right on the computer building!
Quick, light the fuse.
Hurry, Max, hurry.
You got another match, 99?
- Why?
- I lit my shoelace.
Good.
Signal the sub.
There's a submarine surfacing, Max.
And there goes the computer.
Come on, 99, let's get out of here.
Everything went perfectly, from A to Z. Would you believe A to B?
Welcome aboard.
Weapons, please.
Hands up!
Siegfried!
we're on the wrong submarine.
We meet again, Maxwell Smart.
-  -  - There goes my shoe phone again.
- I counted on that.
Take her down to periscope depth.
- How did you pick us up?
- Simple.
I read your blinker signal.
Siegfried, don't you know it's not nice to read somebody else's blinker signal?
As you go through the world of espionage, Smart, you will find there are the good guys and the bad guys.
I happen to be one of the bad guys.
There's a U.S. destroyer out there that can blow this submarine right out of the water.
No, it will not, Miss 99.
We will pass through unharmed.
What makes you think so?
Because I have informed your Chief that you are in the hands of KAOS.
He would surely not give the order to sink this submarine or you would also be killed.
Mmm!
He is too loyal.
Don't be too sure about that, Siegfried.
Our Chief can be just as disloyal as anyone else.
I do not believe that-- und before we slip out of here I am going to take my revenge on CONTROL - for blowing up our computer.
- Max: How?
By torpedoing that unsuspecting destroyer up there.
It's a sitting duck.
- You couldn't do that!
- Oh, yes he could, 99.
As you go through the world of espionage you'll learn that some people are very likeable and easy to get along with.
And then there are other people who are-- - How does that go, Siegfried?
- I'm one of the bad guys!
He's one of the bad guys.
Up periscope!
Aha The destroyer's moving out of range but I can still get it.
Max, we've gotta do something.
Say, Siegfried, this sure is a nice little submarine you got here.
Prepare torpedo!
Would you mind if I took a little peek?
We don't peek here!
Come on, Siegfried, if this were my submarine and you were my prisoner I'd let you take a peek.
Yeah, and while you are peeking my valuable time is wasting.
and by the time you get finished peeking and by the time I get back to the periscope the destroyer is out of range.
That trick is stupid!
That trick is dumb!
That trick is childish!
Und the destroyer is out of range.
Time is growing short.
You have to make up your mind, Chief.
If we let that KAOS submarine get away, we may never get another crack at it.
If we sink it I lose two top agents and my two best friends.
It's a difficult decision.
What's it gonna be, Chief?
Gentlemen, I've made up my mind.
Both: Yes?
I've decided to leave the decision to you.
Very well, Chief.
- I say sink the sub.
- I say we don't.
That makes a tie.
You'll have to cast the deciding vote, Chief.
I cannot let friendship affect my judgment.
Sink the sub.
Up periscope!
Nothing nothing nothing nothing six destroyers nothing Six destroyers headed right for our position?
!
You'd better surrender, Siegfried.
- Never!
- You mind if we do?
Forget it, Smart.
We are going to hide on the bottom.
All engines ready!
Prepare to dive!
Down periscope!
Dive!
- Krueger.
- Ja?
What is our position?
We are on the bottom.
Terrific.
- Listen, Siegfried-- - Quiet!
I wish to see if they know our position.
- I want complete silence!
-  Shh!
You don't "shush" here!
I "shush" here!
Shush!
Those destroyers have absolutely no idea where we are.
Someone just took a great guess.
That was close.
We may have to make a run for it.
What's the matter, Siegfried, afraid to die?
Max!
We're gonna die too.
Oh.
Well, in that case I have a suggestion.
- Siegfried: What?
- Let's make a run for it.
No, I think not.
Look, Siegfried, your men look like they're about to panic.
Never!
My men are carefully trained.
They will not panic until I give the order to panic.
Prepare to panic!
Those depth charges are getting closer, Siegfried.
It's just a matter of minutes until they hit us.
My men have been under attack before.
We will remain in this area for another five minutes, Then I will execute a counter-maneuver.
Listen to me, men.
Siegfried doesn't care if you stay down here and drown like rats.
Your only chance is to follow me and mutiny.
Mutiny?
Don't be ridiculous.
They will not mutiny.
Cover them!
Men, think of your wives and children.
Dummkopfs.
None of you are married.
Listen, are you gonna gamble and take the one small chance you've got to get out of here alive, or are you going to surrender and be guaranteed life imprisonment?
Men, I hope you realize a mutiny might affect your pensions.
I'm prepared to offer you $5,000 each.
You fools!
We still have a chance to get out of this.
And in case you have forgotten, next week is the annual KAOS dance!
$10,000.
I'm sorry, Smart.
My men just happen to be crazy about dancing.
They're zeroing in on you, Siegfried.
Krueger!
What did he say, Max?
He said to release the oil.
It's an old trick, 99.
When the oil gets to the surface they think the sub has been hit.
But let me tell you this, Siegfried-- The trick is stupid!
The trick is dumb!
The trick is childish!
The trick is childish!
And the trick is working.
Quickly, take these two to the torpedo room.
You, Smart, over here.
Load yourself into the torpedo tube.
Just what have you got in mind, Siegfried?
I think my little plan will amuse you.
Well, I certainly hope so, because up until now you haven't exactly been a barrel of laughs.
Perhaps when you fully understand.
I am going to fire the both of you from the torpedo tubes.
When the destroyers move in to recover your bodies, I will fire the real torpedoes.
Get in!
Wait a minute, Siegfried.
May I have one last request?
Last request?
It's just that Maxwell Smart and I have been very dear friends for a long time and I'd like to shake his hand goodbye.
What kind of a last request is this?
What harm could it do?
Go ahead!
Max, the mini T.H.!
- Mini T.H.?
- Yes, the Miniature Torpedo Hammer.
There's a powerful explosive in the head of this hammer.
One tap on the nose of this torpedo and we'll all be blown to bits.
Your gun, Siegfried.
All right, now have your men drop their guns and bring the sub to the surface.
Do as he says.
I hope you've learned your lesson, Siegfried.
I sure have.
What did he say, Max?
From now on, no more last requests!
All right, Siegfried, move out.
Well, Siegfried, you're going away to prison for a long long time.
I have escaped from prisons before and I shall escape from prisons again.
And Max will capture you again.
- Really, Miss 99?
- Yes, Siegfried.
As you go through the world of espionage you'll find out that there are some bad guys and some good guys.
And Maxwell Smart happens to be one of the good guys.
As one bad guy to one good guy, I promise you we shall meet again, Smart!
All right, Siegfried, move out.
- Max, tell me something.
- Yes, what is it, 99?
If Siegfried hadn't surrendered, would you really have hit the torpedo with that hammer?
Yes, but it wouldn't have done any good.
You see, I happened to have noticed with my eagle eye that the firing pin on this hammer was defective.
- Really?
- Yeah, it's no good at all.
- 99, do me a favor!
?
- To do what, Max?
Remind me to have my eagle eye checked!
- Hello, Chief.
- 99, Max!
Am I glad to see you.
Welcome home.
Thought we were gone forever, huh, Chief?
Nonsense, Max.
I have all the confidence in the world in you.
Oh really?
Then perhaps you can explain why a stranger's car is in my parking place and someone else's gym shoes are in my locker.
It's only temporary, Max.
I knew you'd be gone for at least a week.
Are you sure, Chief?
- Of course, Max.
-  Yes?
Hobson: Agent 86 to see you, sir.
Uh, haven't you made some sort of mistake, Hobson?
No, sir, you reassigned that number last week.
- I'm sorry, Max.
- It's okay, Chief.
I'm expendable.
- I'll make it up to you, Max.
- A raise?
No, we're over budget.
A vacation?
I can't spare you right now.
How about another suicide mission?
Don't be a grouch!
I'm proud of the way you and 99 handled this assignment.
Thank you, Chief.
At least Siegfried is behind bars where he belongs.
I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you, Max.
- Siegfried has escaped.
- You're kidding.
No, as a matter of fact I just got this telegram for you.
"Will not rest until I have killed you in cold blood.
Sincerely, Siegfried".
Max, he really means that.
I knew he was vicious, cruel and rotten, but he's gone too far.
What do you mean?
This telegram was sent collect!
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Hold it, 99, I think this is the place.
Max, are you sure this is where Agent 51 said to meet him?
What's the matter with you, 99?
You're awfully jumpy.
- Don't you like the circus?
- Not at night, Max.
- Listen to those animals.
-   - Relax, 99.
- Relax?
Agent 51 said to be very careful, that we'd be in extreme danger every minute.
a way of life to me.
The whole secret to it is to remain calm and poised at all times.
- Max-- - Agh!
Don't do that, 99.
I'm sorry, Max, but I thought I heard footsteps.
I didn't hear anything, 99.
It must be your imagination.
I'm Agent 51.
Don't be afraid.
- 51, what's going on here?
- You scared me to death!
I'm sorry, but I didn't want any screams when you saw me.
I wouldn't have screamed.
I wasn't worried about you.
What's going on, 51?
What are you doing in that ridiculous gorilla costume?
It was the only job they had open.
Listen, I haven't got much time.
I'm due back for rehearsal.
But I think I've cracked the case.
Tell the Chief that-- uh!
They got me, 86, they got me.
Who got you, who?
Tell us quick.
- Give him a chance, 99.
Take it easy.
- Max, there's no time.
Will you let me handle this?
a glass of water?
No thanks, I-- How about a banana?
It's no use, Max.
He's dead.
Poor 51.
What a way to go-- with a knife in his back in a ridiculous gorilla suit.
Well, that's show business.
KAOS is using this circus for a smuggling operation.
Everywhere this circus has traveled in Europe and America, supplies of industrial diamonds have become depleted.
Now added to that is the fact that there have been four mysterious deaths in the circus in the past six months.
Agent 51 was the fifth.
Each of the others died a violent death during an actual performance.
Hmm.
No wonder they draw such big crowds.
Max, did you find anything on 51's body?
Well, just this ring, Chief.
Let me see.
It's a diamond ring.
You know what that could mean?
He was engaged?
No, he was getting closer to the truth.
That's why he was eliminated.
Max, you and 99 will return to the circus to get to the bottom of this.
I want you to get over to the lab and see Carlson for some special equipment.
I want you to pose as reporters for "Circus World" magazine.
Look, Chief, since this is a circus, why don't we go as tent salesmen?
What's the matter with being reporters?
Well, nothing, Chief, except that a tent's a better cover.
A little humor there, Chief.
Okay.
Now since your cover is to be reporters, we've developed this special equipment.
Inside this camera is a hidden tape recorder.
And this tape recorder actually conceals a hidden camera.
- May I ask a question, Prof.
Carlson?
- Certainly.
Uh, why hide a tape recorder in a camera and a camera in a tape recorder?
Why not just take pictures with the camera and record with the recorder?
Because my mind doesn't work that way, that's why.
Mr. Smart?
I'm Pepper Hanlon, press agent for the circus.
- Good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
Uh, "Circus World" magazine asked us to do a story on your circus, Mr. Hanlon, and we thought an interesting approach might be the bad luck that's been dogging you, like the five fatal accidents in the last six months.
Oh, yes, that's a terrible shame.
Of course the circus can be a dangerous business.
Is the circus insured?
An insurance man came around just last month.
- Oh, that's good.
- No, that's bad.
He had an accident.
- Was he insured?
- I don't think so.
Where would you like to begin your interviews?
We thought we might like to start with the main suspects-- uh, performers.
Um, how about Raymond the Magnificent, the knife thrower?
- Fine, his trailer is right over there.
- Oh, thank you.
You must be the reporters from the "Circus World" magazine.
And you must be Raymond the Magnificent.
You may tell your readers I am the greatest knife thrower in the world.
Have you always been a knife thrower, Raymond?
No.
I started in the circus, jumping 500' from a diving board into a barrel of flaming oil.
Wasn't that incredibly dangerous?
I took steps to minimize the risks.
- What did you do?
- I cut out matinees.
Well, I must say, Raymond, that you certainly keep your knives in magnificent condition.
The blade of this one sparkles like a diamond.
-  - Come in.
Who's that?
That's Rudolph, the circus mascot.
Now if you'll excuse me please, I must see to an urgent matter.
strange about that man.
Did you notice the reaction on his face when I said the word "diamond"?
- Mm-hmm.
- I think he knows something.
- Take a look and see where he went.
- Right, Max.
Max, he's gone into another trailer.
He's in there talking to someone.
Do you think we should consult the Chief about him?
Max, he's just a harmless little monkey.
I know that, 99, but he's still our Chief.
Max, that's the trailer over there that Raymond went into.
It belongs to Gertrude-Gerald, the half-man, half-woman.
Well, we'll just wait until Raymond leaves and then we'll ask Gertrude-Gerald a few questions.
Mr. Smart, Mr. Smart, down here.
I'm Tiny Allen.
Mr. Smart, I understand you're interested in the circus accidents.
And a little matter of smuggled diamonds.
Go on.
I don't want Raymond to see me talking to you.
Can you come to my trailer in about 20 minutes?
I'll have some information for you.
- I'll be there.
- It's number seven.
Well, 99 it's time to question our next suspect.
So my magazine just wants anything that would be of interest to our readers.
For example, does your condition present any personal problems?
Well, I have trouble checking into hotels.
Do you enjoy circus life?
- Hmm, I hate it.
- Oh, really?
Why?
You meet too many weirdoes.
Besides, people in show business are too self-centered.
I often work with people for months and then when I run into them years later they don't even say hello.
Well, perhaps they don't recognize you.
Tell me, Gertrude-Gerald-- Please, call me Gertie-Gerry.
All right, Gertie-Gerry, what did you do before you joined the circus?
I was a dance team.
Uh, Gertie-Gerry, my readers would like to know something about your personal tastes.
For example, how do you feel about diamonds?
Diamonds.
They don't mean a thing to me.
Are you absolutely certain that diamonds mean nothing to you?
Well, diamonds do have a certain appeal.
They glitter like a million starry nights.
You know, it's strange that you should ask about diamonds.
Why?
Well, Tiny Allen the midget was talking about diamonds just the other day.
In fact-- in fact he offered to give me one.
Did you accept?
Are you kidding?
With him around?
Tell me, what do you think of the several deaths that have occurred in the circus recently?
I ignore such things.
I mind my own business and devote myself to my two hobbies.
What are they?
Weightlifting and embroidery.
Max, I guess we'd better go see Tiny Allen.
I don't think Gertrude-Gerald knows too much.
Don't be too sure about that, 99.
Did you notice the expression on their faces - when I asked about the diamonds?
- Yes.
One of them is lying.
Well, how did it go with Gertrude and Gerald?
Oh, they were very nice.
I wonder if you could tell us where trailer number seven is.
- Tiny Allen, the midget?
- Yes.
It's that one, right over there.
Uh, thank you very much.
Come on, 99.
Tiny Allen?
- Tiny Allen.
-  For a little fellow he's got a real deep voice.
Max, that's it over there-- number seven.
Oh.
Can Hondo help you?
Uh, yes.
Well, you see, I had an appointment with Tiny Allen and the door is locked.
Me strongman.
Me fix.
Ah!
You know, I had a dentist in the army that used to work the same way.
That's strange, 99.
All the windows are locked from the inside too.
Max, look!
He's been shot through the back at close range.
Hmm, committed suicide.
That's impossible, Max.
You're right.
There's no gun.
Wait a minute.
If all the doors and windows are locked from the inside, how did the murderer get out?
Well, maybe he was murdered on the outside and then slipped in through this transom.
But then how did he lock the door?
Simply by turning the key, 99.
Have you ever heard of a case where a dead man locked a door?
No.
Not until now.
There must be some other explanation.
Maybe we should question that strongman.
You're right, 99.
He certainly was close by this trailer when we arrived.
- Come on.
- Right.
Pardon me, Hondo, could I ask you a few questions?
Me Hondo, circus strongman.
Uh, me Maxwell Smart, magazine reporter.
You certainly do look strong, Hondo.
Hondo can lift locomotive with one hand.
Really?
Um, do you happen to know anything about diamonds, Hondo?
Hondo can crush diamonds with teeth.
What kind of a trick is that?
Expensive.
What else does Hondo do?
Hondo's greatest trick is keeping twin-engine plane from taking off.
- How do you do that?
- I break pilot's legs.
That Hondo is a brute.
Yes, but fortunately we're trained to deal with guys like that.
- How, Max?
- By trying not to antagonize them.
Well, we're right back where we started.
Not quite, 99.
Let's take a look at what we've got: a dead midget, a chimpanzee, a strongman who crushes cameras with his hands, a half-man, half-woman who likes embroidery and weightlifting.
It's all beginning to form a pattern.
Max, you mean you know?
Max, that knife missed you by inches.
You think it's some kind of a warning?
Wait a minute, 99.
I've seen that knife somewhere before.
But where?
- Max, I know.
- Hold it, 99, I'm trying to place the knife.
- But, Max, that knife-- - 99, would you please be quiet?
You're interrupting my train of thought.
- It's Raymond's knife.
- There, now you've done it.
You've broken my train of thought when I almost had it.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Raymond's knives had the same kind of handles.
This must be Raymond's knife.
Good thinking, Max.
Now that we know who the knife belongs to, all we have to do is to figure out who threw it.
Max, it has to be Raymond's knife.
Well, if it is, he's in a lot of trouble.
- Why?
- He missed me twice.
He could lose his job.
It's no use, 99.
We've searched everywhere and still no diamonds.
- I'd better call in.
Keep a lookout.
- Right.
- What have you got, Max?
- Absolutely nothing, Chief.
We've drawn a complete blank.
Have you searched everywhere?
Those diamonds have got to be there.
Believe me, Chief, we have searched everywhere.
-  - Except in the lion's cage.
Why haven't you searched there, Max?
Are you kidding?
There are lions in there!
Max, when you joined CONTROL you knew it would involve certain risks.
- I know, Chief, but-- -  Well, you just can't go barging into a lion's cage.
They may resent strangers.
Max, I don't expect you to go into the cage alone.
- Oh.
- Take a whip and a chair.
A whip and a chair?
Well, to tell you the truth, Chief, those lions look pretty mean.
I don't think a whip and a chair will be enough.
What do you have in mind, Max?
Uh, well-- does the word "bazooka" mean anything to you?
Max, we have to have those diamonds to make an arrest.
It could mean the end of the KAOS smuggling operation once and for all.
Right, Chief.
Now you're just going to have to go in there and face those vicious, hungry, man-eating lions.
- But, Max - Yes, Chief?
Don't take any unnecessary risks.
What did he say, Max?
- I've gotta go into the lion's cage.
- Max, you can't do that.
I've got to, 99.
It's an order.
And an order is an order.
Nothing can stop me.
Hold it, Smart!
Boy, am I glad to see you.
It'll be a pleasure to get rid of two more CONTROL agents.
Wait a minute, Hanlon, how did you know I was a CONTROL agent?
Any man who will go into a lion's cage unarmed is either a CONTROL agent or a fool.
Are you sure those are my only choices?
- All right, drop that chair!
- 99, duck!
Oh!
All right, Hondo.
I'm used to dealing with big ugly apes like you.
Uh, listen, Hondo, I-- I hope I wasn't out of line with that crack about the ape.
So, Hanlon, you're the leader of this little conspiracy.
That's right, Mr. Smart.
Diamonds are so much more rewarding than press agentry.
Of course I knew from the first you weren't reporters.
Oh, what made you suspicious?
You asked too many questions.
Of course, I knew that would give us away.
And now you know too much to live.
How are you going to explain our disappearance?
Since accidental death is not uncommon in the circus, we'll arrange to have you both killed at tonight's performance.
The highlight of each performance is when a man is shot from a cannon.
Hondo, prepare Mr. Smart to be the human cannonball.
The human cannonball.
The human cannonball?
So that's how you plan to kill me.
No, that's how we dispose of the body.
Oh, that's different.
Listen, Hanlon, leave the girl alone.
She doesn't know a thing.
I'm afraid that's impossible, Smart.
We're depending on your lovely assistant - to be our new lion tamer.
-  She should survive no more than 10 seconds in there with those hungry cats.
Max, I'm scared.
Don't be scared, 99, we hold the aces in this game.
- What do you mean?
- Just this, Hanlon: In the morning the police will receive a letter exposing your entire operation, which I took the precaution of writing last night.
I told you he was dangerous.
When the police get this letter, you'll all go to prison for-- Listen, Hondo, you want to make yourself $10?
Mail this letter.
Hondo, destroy that letter!
Destroy it!
If it was phone book Take them away!
Take them!
This isn't fair, two against one.
Oh, Max, I'm afraid this is it.
Hanlon said those lions haven't been fed in three days.
Oh, I'm sure he's exaggerating, 99.
They must have sent out for something.
A sandwich, a doughnut, piece of strudel.
I hope you're right, Max.
Listen, 99-- in case I don't get out of this alive and you do-- Max, you will get out of this alive!
Well, just in case I don't, 99, I'd like you to do me a favor.
I don't want a big funeral.
I'd just like a few of my close friends to get together and try to bring me back to life.
If only we could get out of these ropes.
- 99, wait a minute.
- What?
- These glass buttons.
- Max, try it.
Hurry, Max, hurry.
through these ropes like butter.
Max, you don't think-- They're diamonds, 99, hidden right out here in plain view.
Max, quick, they're coming.
- Hurry!
- Now listen, just keep your hands behind your back and when we get outside - we'll make a break for it.
- Right, Max.
All right, Mr. Smart, you're about to make your debut and your farewell appearance all in one night.
Raymond, cut the ropes.
All right, get up!
- Max-- - Quiet, 99, the show must go on.
Let's go.
Now!
- Oh!
- I'll get him, you get her.
No, I'll get him.
You get her.
- Never mind, I'll get them both.
- Right.
Nice going, Max!
Oh!
Max, it's Hondo.
I know it's Hondo, 99.
Shoot!
Shoot!
No, I don't want to arouse the crowd inside unless I have to.
- Use your knives!
- 99: No!
Now look what you've done, Hondo.
You've ruined a perfectly good crowbar.
Grab him, Hondo!
Raymond, throw your knives.
Max!
Missed me by that much.
Twice.
Hondo know why.
-  - No, Hondo, no no no no!
Stop it, Hondo, stop!
No!
I'll have to finish you two off myself.
Take care of these two men.
And take care of this one too.
- 99, are you all right?
- Chief!
So this is what you do at night.
When I didn't hear from you for six hours, I was afraid they might try something at tonight's performance.
Are you all right, Max?
Yes, I'm fine, 99, except for my body.
We found the diamonds, Chief.
- They were part of Raymond's costume.
- Good work, 99.
Yes, Chief, those three were part of a KAOS gang that was responsible for the murder of those agents.
-  - What about him?
I mean, her?
- I don't know what I mean.
- That's Gertrude-Gerald-- one of the most insidious villains I've ever encountered, with all the cunning of a man and the strength of a woman.
I think it's the other way around, Max.
Huh?
Oh-- eh, yes, right, 99.
All right, Gertrude-Gerald, come along.
You played your last performance.
Wait a minute, Chief.
Aren't you gonna frisk her?
Uh, him-- uh, them?
Max, we'll take care of that down at headquarters.
Wait a minute, Chief.
Why take any chances?
Why don't we take care of it right here and now?
Max, it might be a little embarrassing.
Huh?
Oh.
Yes, I see what you mean, Chief.
Well, it's really quite simple, Chief.
Here's what we'll do-- I'll frisk Gertrude and you'll frisk Gerald.
No, Max.
I've got it, Chief.
I'll frisk 99 and you frisk Gertrude and Gerald.
You wanna frisk me and let Gertrude and Gerald frisk each other?
I've got an idea, Chief.
Why don't we take them down to headquarters and frisk them down there?
loose end to this case.
How did they murder Tiny Allen in a locked room?
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Chief.
Shh!
Here comes your answer now.
It's Rudolph the circus mascot.
We're gonna have to arrest him as an accessory in the murder of Tiny Allen.
You're in a lot of trouble, little fellow.
Max, what are you talking about?
That's what I'm trying to tell you, Chief.
Don't you see what happened?
Hanlon murdered the midget, then he sent this trained monkey through the transom, had him lock the door and leave the same way.
That's ingenious, but how did you know he'd come back?
Because the criminal always returns to the scene of his crime.
- Kind of a shame though, Chief.
- What do you mean?
Well, poor little devil is gonna have to spend the rest of his life behind bars.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
If we don't hear from Agent 27 today, we're going to have to send someone in to find him.
You're really worried about him, Chief.
since we've had a message from him.
Well, Chief, you know how Agent 27 hates to write letters.
Max, the assignment he was on is a vital one.
We've traced Hans Hunter halfway around the world.
This may be our last chance to capture him.
Hans Hunter.
Wasn't he a high-ranking Nazi?
He was at various times a Nazi, a communist, a member of the mafia, and is right now one of the top executives of KAOS.
If there's anything I hate, it's a joiner.
-  - Yes?
Oh, have him bring it right in.
It's something from 27.
You can just put it down right there.
Sign right there, please.
Hey, what kind of a signature is that?
It's "The Chief".
It's my official signature.
Sorry, mister, but I got to have a name on this.
This is a top-secret government organization.
My real name is classified information.
I'm sorry, but no name, no delivery.
That's company policy.
- This is ridiculous!
- That's tough beans, Charlie.
All right, all right.
- Oh, boy.
- What's the matter with you now?
I've delivered a lot of packages in my time, some here to CONTROL and some over to KAOS headquarters, and I'll tell you this-- crime may not pay, but it sure tips a lot better.
All right, let's get this crate open.
- Max, you have your screwdriver?
- Right here, Chief.
Chief, it's 27!
Chief, I think there's something definitely wrong with 27.
I'll say there is.
He's dead.
Well, at least he can't get any worse.
He looks so strange.
I don't know how to say this, 99, but Agent 27 has been stuffed.
Stuffed?
Oh, how horrible, Chief.
- The only thing left is to bury him.
- It seems a shame to bury him.
- What do you mean?
- Couldn't we donate him to a museum?
- What did you find out, Max?
- You were right, Chief.
The boys in the lab went over the body thoroughly, and they found out that he was shot with a poisoned dart, then stuffed like an animal.
Who do you think did it, Chief?
Hans Hunter?
Undoubtedly, 99.
It's typical of his and KAOS's fiendish sense of humor.
They must have killed him and then sent us the body as a warning.
Chief, you've got to let me go after Hunter.
I want to get that madman, no matter how dangerous it is.
I don't care if he is one of the world's greatest killers.
I don't care if he is a master of fiendish torture and death.
I want him, Chief.
You've got to let me have that assignment.
- You've got it, Max.
- If you'd rather send someone else - The job's yours, Max.
- I don't want to force you into it.
- You'll leave tonight, you and 99.
- Where do we go, Chief?
That's exactly what we have to find out.
We've got to figure out where 27's body was sent from.
Well, Chief, why don't we do a little basic detective work?
Now, for example, the wood in this crate is thin and unprocessed.
There's no evidence of any machine tools used on it, and the nails are of a peculiar shape not usually manufactured in this hemisphere.
Then there are some hairs caught in this slat here, as though the crate had been carried over a long distance by animal.
Those are excellent clues, Max, but what do they mean?
They mean this, Chief-- that this crate was put together and sent from the Caribbean island of Moriva.
Max, that's fantastic!
It certainly is.
How did you arrive at that conclusion?
From the return address.
Now, we'll get you to Moriva by submarine.
Since you're posing as sportsmen on a hunting and fishing expedition, I've asked Carlson to come up with some special equipment to fit with your gear.
- Carlson.
- This has been specifically designed for the agent on vacation.
It's called a V-11 Modified Vindicator, Resort Model.
Let me show you how it works.
Are you ready, gentlemen?
-  -  Oh, it's one of the deadliest guns I've ever invented.
It's a little unsportsmanlike for shooting fish, isn't it?
Max, it's an antipersonnel weapon.
Have you got anything else, Carlson?
Well, we have the A-14 Mark II Incinigrator.
That's fascinating, Professor.
What does it do?
Absolutely nothing.
But in the event you're captured by the enemy, they'll be so intrigued by the way it works, you'll have time to escape.
Carlson, do you have something compact and lethal that they can carry on their persons?
Well, yes.
We have the only new device right over here.
- Oh, cigarettes.
- Not just cigarettes, Chief.
- They're called Bazooka Butts.
- Plain or menthol?
Neither.
You see, you put one in your mouth, light it, take one puff, then throw it.
- And what happens?
- A super grenade, complete devastation.
Oh, but you don't have to worry about a thing.
You see, as long as they're not ignited, nothing will happen.
And don't forget that only half of them are Bazooka Butts.
The rest are real cigarettes camouflaging them.
You be sure and brief 99 on this.
You'd better come with me, Max.
Your submarine is waiting.
Uh, just one question, Professor.
What happens if you take more than one puff?
You'll blow a hole in the back of your head the size of a basketball.
Well, that's one way to quit smoking.
Where do we go now, Max?
Well, let's take a look at the map and see.
Okay.
Now here's our route.
We go straight along this path past Alligator Swamp, turn right at the rattlesnake pit, then crawl through the spider cave and go single file between the sulfur bog and Dead Man's Cliff.
Max, isn't there another way?
- Yes, 99, but they advise against it.
- Why?
It's too dangerous.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Max, I can't go any further.
We're really lost.
Don't be ridiculous, 99.
I know exactly where I'm going.
I have an infallible sense of direction.
But, Max, it just seems to me that we've been walking in circles for hours.
But that can't be possible.
Every time we've stopped on the trail, I've made a little mark.
That way we know where we've been.
- What kind of little mark, Max?
- A little "X".
- Like that?
- Exactly like that.
Oh, Max.
We're hopelessly lost.
Would you drop that please, Mr. Smart?
Take their weapons.
My name is Hans Hunter.
I'm sure you've heard of me.
Yes.
Murderer, thief and traitor.
Well, people will gossip.
I'm sure your lovely companion will learn to like me just a little bit.
- I doubt that very much.
-  Take them to the lodge.
Just a minute, Hunter.
You don't really think we'd be stupid enough to come in here alone, do you?
- What do you mean?
- Just this-- in a very short while General Crawford and a hundred of his crack paratroopers will come crashing into this landing.
Would you believe J Edgar Hoover and 10 of his G-men?
How about Tarzan and a couple of his apes?
Get moving.
Bomba the Jungle Boy?
Make yourselves comfortable.
Please sit down.
Ah, you're much smarter than your Agent 27.
If he had taken my advice and gotten some rest, he would have lasted a few minutes longer.
So you did murder Agent 27.
"Murder" is a very nasty word.
Let's just say that in the contest between myself and 27, I was the victor.
- Contest?
What contest?
- Yes.
Hunting is my hobby, Mr. Smart.
I've hunted all over the world-- India, Africa, the wilds of Tibet.
I have stalked and killed a huge rogue elephant, the ferocious Bengal tiger, and once, Mr. Smart-- once, Mr. Smart-- have you ever heard of the Great White Rhino?
That was done by the Great White Rhino?
No.
This was done by a small blue convertible.
The Great White Rhino was driving a small blue convertible?
Mr. Smart, I've heard of your exploits.
You too are a hunter-- a hunter of men, a man much worthy of my skill.
I knew when I killed Agent 27 you would come hunting me.
Yes, Hunter, I've accepted your challenge.
And here we are face to face.
Now what do you have in mind?
I could kill you, Mr. Smart.
I could kill you very easily.
But I will give you one chance to live-- a 50-50 chance.
We will play a little game called Russian Roulette.
It's very simple, really.
Six chambers, one cartridge.
-  - Would you like to begin?
- You wouldn't switch to checkers?
- No.
The game is over, Hunter.
Get over there.
All right, now everybody stay right where you are.
- 99, we're getting out of here.
- Igor, stop them.
Stay where you are, lgor.
I'm warning you.
One more step and I'll put a bullet right between those beady little eyes.
Uh, listen, lgor, I hope I wasn't out of line with that crack about the beady eyes.
Put him down, lgor.
Very well, Mr. Smart.
Most resourceful.
But surely you didn't think I would put a loaded weapon in your hands.
Max, he palmed the bullet.
And now I must say good night.
I have to get up early.
Igor and I are going hunting.
Oh?
And what poor animal are you gonna hunt this time?
As you can see, Mr. Smart, my trophy collection includes one of almost every kind of animal except one-- you, a Homo sapien.
Now just a minute, Hunter!
I'm as normal as you are!
What about me, Hunter?
I have other plans for you, my dear.
I hope that you will stay on here as my permanent guest.
I'd rather take my chances in the jungle with Max.
Very loyal, my dear, and very stupid.
We're CONTROL agents, Hunter.
We're trained to be very loyal and very stupid.
Igor will show you to your rooms.
Get a good rest.
We'll have an early start.
Max, what are we going to do?
He's going to set us loose in the jungle, hunt us down and kill us!
Don't be ridiculous, 99.
With my skill as a jungle fighter, he doesn't have a chance.
- You know it and I know it.
- Max, look!
Now if only he knew it.
I will give you one hour's head start, Mr. Smart.
If you can elude me until sundown, you will go free.
- You'll let us go free?
- You have my word.
Why should we take the word of a vicious, homicidal, psychopathic killer like you?
Because I am a gentleman.
Oh.
Well, that's different.
Okay.
Now how about weapons?
Yes.
I will limit myself to rifles, shotguns, pistols and knives.
Oh, that seems fair.
Now how about us?
You?
You will have your raw courage, your daring, your resourcefulness, your sharp wits.
Listen, Hunter, I'll make a deal with you.
I'll trade you two of my sharp wits for one of your rifles.
Good luck, Mr. Smart.
How about her raw courage for a pistol?
I suggest that you start.
My resourcefulness for a knife?
Very well.
That might make the hunt more interesting.
Oh, I suggest you start running.
Listen, lgor, how would you like to swap this nice new knife for that dirty old pistol?
- Ehh.
- Was that "yes" or "no"?
- No.
- I thought so.
Until sundown, Mr. Smart.
- Oh!
- Come on, we can't stop now.
We've got to keep going.
They're gonna catch up with us, Max.
What are we gonna do?
- We've got to even the odds.
- How?
- Here, take this and start digging.
- Why?
We're gonna build a pit.
Then I'm gonna sharpen some stakes and put them in the bottom of the pit, then we'll cover the pit over.
Nobody'll know it's there.
Then finally someone will jump into the pit and be impaled on the stakes.
I've heard of that, Max.
It's called a Malayan Mantrap.
- It is?
- Uh-huh.
Do you think it'll work?
- Well, that all depends, 99.
- On what?
- On whether Hunter's a Malayan man.
- Oh!
Keep digging, 99.
- Max, listen!
- What is it?
Do you know what that sound is?
I'm not sure, but it'll never make the top 10.
- That's the dogs.
They're almost here.
- What time is it?
It's only 3:00.
We won't be out of danger as long as that sun's shining.
The way I look at it, 99, there's only one thing that can save us.
- What is that?
- A total eclipse.
Max, here they come!
All right.
That's it.
From now on, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
I c-- I can't go any further, Max.
You've got to try, 99.
It's almost sundown.
- Max, a bridge.
- It looks like the only way across, 99.
Listen, if we can get across this bridge and then destroy it, Hans Hunter will have no way of following us.
- But, Max, it doesn't look very safe.
- Don't be ridiculous, 99.
Whoever built this bridge built it strong enough to support their weight.
- Who do you think did build it, Max?
- A very small pygmy.
How far do you think it is to the bottom of that gorge?
- About a half a mile.
- Listen, Max.
If you took a running start and you jumped as far as you could, how far do you think you could go?
-  - About a half a mile.
Listen, Max, they're coming.
We've got to do something.
I'm all for taking our chances on the bridge.
- What's the alternative?
- Certain death.
In that case, I'm all for taking our chances on the bridge.
Listen, Max, it's not gonna hold both of us, though.
- 99, I'll carry you across.
- That's not gonna work, Max.
- I still think we should go together.
- Why?
Well, that way, in case the bridge collapses, then at least we'll have someone to talk to on the way down.
- All right, but hurry!
- Okay, 99.
- Now follow close behind me, 99.
- Okay.
And be very careful.
The slightest little swing, - we could go plunging to our deaths.
- Right.
And whatever you do, 99, don't laugh.
Max, I can't hold on!
Just a little ways longer, 99.
Don't let go now.
Come on, 99.
Just a little ways more.
- We made it, Max!
- Listen, 99.
Max, it's lgor.
He's going to cross the bridge.
What are we going to do?
- I've got to stop him.
You stay here.
- Be careful, Max!
Good work, Max!
- Now let's take care of the bridge.
- Right.
All we have to do is let the bridge down, 99.
Once we destroy the bridge, Hunter can't follow us.
It's five minutes till sundown, 99.
We've made it!
Well, Mr. Smart, it's been fun while it lasted.
Come down, please.
You really didn't do as well as I thought you would, although you dispatched lgor quite nicely.
Huh-uh!
It's only 4:55, Mr. Smart.
I was sure you'd still be alive at least until 5:00.
I'm disappointed.
You're disappointed?
How do you think we feel?
Before I kill you, I will make a final offer.
I would still like to keep one of you with me.
It would be a terrible waste for someone so young and so beautiful to die.
I'm sorry, Hunter, but I'm not interested.
- I think he means me, Max.
- Huh?
Oh.
Yes, of course, 99.
Well, what do you say?
- You know what my answer is.
- Of course.
You see, Mr. Hunter, with a dedicated agent like 99, there can be only one answer to a suggestion like that, and I think we all know what that answer is.
- What is that answer, 99?
- No!
Of course.
The answer is no, Hunter.
Then prepare to die.
- Wait.
- You've changed your mind?
No, I'd just like one last request.
- What is it?
- Just a cigarette.
Go ahead.
It will be your last.
Max, may I have a cigarette, please?
smoking at a time like this?
Yes, I'd really like a cigarette, and I think you ought to have one too.
Forget it, 99.
You know I'm trying to quit smoking.
Max, I think you need a cigarette.
I don't need right now, it's a c-- of course.
That's exactly what I need.
You have 15 seconds, Mr. Smart.
- Do you have a light, Max?
- Right here.
- 10 seconds.
- Oh, it's got to work!
- It's got a money-back guarantee.
- Five seconds.
Are you quite finished, Mr. Smart?
We'll know in a minute.
Oh, Max, how terrible!
He deserved it, 99.
He was a KAOS killer.
Sometimes I wonder if we're any better, Max.
What are you talking about, 99?
We have to shoot and kill and destroy.
We represent everything that's wholesome and good in the world.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Oh, Max, I just love surprise parties.
Me too, 99.
Boy, time really does fly.
Do you realize, 99, that Agent 54 will be 36 today?
My gosh, it seems like only yesterday that 54 was 35.
- What time's he coming, Max?
- In about an hour.
I told him to be here for a surprise party promptly at 8:00.
Hey, want to see the present I got for him?
- Oh, I'd love to.
- It's a painting, 99.
Oh, Max, I didn't know you were painting.
Oh, yes, I do a lot of painting now.
The CONTROL psychiatrist said that it would be good therapy for me to counterbalance the violence and brutality in my work.
So I painted this picture of Agent 54 shooting and stabbing a KAOS man.
- What do you think?
- Um it's very interesting, Max.
It reminds me of Picasso.
Oh, that's too bad.
It's supposed to look like 54.
-  - Oh, that must be the Chief.
Oh, I'll check the birthday cake.
It's early.
I'm sorry, Max.
They threw me out of a speeding car.
Take it easy, take it easy.
We're gonna have a good time anyway.
I've spoiled the whole surprise party.
You look terrible, 54.
I'd better get you a glass of punch.
I asked them to circle the block a couple of times, but they were in a hurry to get rid of me.
I'm sorry, Max.
The birthday boy shouldn't be the first to arrive.
I'll wait in the hall.
You don't have to do that, 54.
Max!
Who is it?
- 54.
- What happened?
He came early.
He's dead, Max.
What a rotten way to celebrate his birthday.
Look at that-- paint.
- He's painted completely blue.
- I thought he looked different.
That's probably how he died, Max-- suffocation by paint.
Well, we'd better go fill the Chief in.
Right, but we'd better make sure that nobody touches the body.
Don't worry, 99.
I'm way ahead of you.
There.
That should do it.
Come on.
Now, think, Max-- did Agent 54 say anything before he died?
Yes, Chief.
He apologized for being early.
No, I don't mean that.
Did he say anything about a Rembrandt von Bronzefinger?
- No, he didn't, Chief.
- What case was Agent 54 working on?
- A KAOS art forgery ring.
- Art forgery?
Yes, we know that KAOS has been replacing famous works of art with clever but worthless copies and then selling the originals behind the Iron Curtain.
This is how they've been financing their operations lately.
Chief, would you mind moving your head to the left just a little bit?
Ah, that's much better.
Now could you tilt it up a little bit?
Good good.
Now just one more thing, Chief.
Could you take this off?
My thumb is stuck.
- Thank you, Chief.
- Chief, do we have anything to go on?
We have reason to believe that KAOS is operating right out of the museum.
Who is this Rembrandt von Bronzefinger?
He's the KAOS agent who copies the masterpieces, then substitutes the copies for the real ones.
He's so good that only an expert could tell his work from the original.
Now we've got to get an agent inside the museum, find out who Bronzefinger is, and stop him.
I don't know why I let you convince me to pose for you.
Well, after all, Chief, you promised me a crack at this assignment.
Max, I told you before, it's not up to me to give you this assignment.
It's up to Mr. Van Cleff.
He's the head of the museum.
He's gonna pick the CONTROL agent who is the best artist.
- For what, Chief?
- To go to work in the restoring room.
Bronzefinger could be one of the technicians working there.
Uh, Chief, I'm up to your mouth now.
You mind not moving your lips while you're talking?
The better artist the agent is, the less likely he'll be suspicious.
Hello?
Oh, good.
Thank you.
Mr. Van Cleff is arriving.
That's all right, Chief.
You don't have to talk like that anymore.
- I'm finished.
- Well, let's see it.
That's me?
It doesn't even look like me.
That's because you moved your mouth.
Let's get to it, gentlemen.
I haven't much time.
All right, Mr. Van Cleff.
Now this was painted by Agent 22.
- He calls it "Afternoon of a Giraffe".
- Very interesting.
Only I wouldn't call it "Afternoon of a Giraffe".
- What would you call it?
- Junk.
Uh, Mr. Van Cleff, how do you like this one over here?
Don't you think it's got a lot of power and magnetism and emotional depth?
Would you believe this painting has been compared to the works of Henri Matisse?
- No.
- Would you believe Michelangelo?
How about Charlton Heston?
You have to excuse Agent 86.
He was very fond of Agent 54, and he's anxious for this assignment.
- Chief, may I speak to you?
- Yes.
Excuse me.
I don't see what's wrong with it.
It's kind of pretty.
A lot of pretty colors-- red and black and green.
Uh, Mr. Van Cleff-- oh, sorry about that.
The paint's still wet.
Mr. Van Cleff, KAOS has just smuggled another masterpiece out of the museum.
There's no time to lose.
You've got to make your decision immediately!
- Is this a dangerous assignment?
- Oh, yes, indeed.
One false move and they'll eliminate our agent.
In that case I choose him.
Oh.
Very wise choice, Mr. Van Cleff.
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll catch the thief who stole those paintings or die in the attempt.
Can you do both?
I'm sorry to take you out of class, Max, but a week of art instruction is all we can spare.
That's all right.
I learned an awful lot in that week.
I learned that if you put blue with yellow you get green, and if you put red with blue you get purple.
- Very good, Max.
- I had four hours of actual painting.
Four hours?
How'd you spend the rest of the time?
Washing.
Max, Mr. Van Cleff has arranged for 99 to be planted in the museum as a guide, and Carlson has devised some very unique art weapons for this mission.
Now what do these look like to you?
They look like ordinary paintbrushes, Chief.
Two of them are, but watch this.
Hey, Chief, you painted a bull's-eye.
Now this may look like an ordinary art palette, but actually it's a bulletproof shield.
Go ahead, Max, try it.
Take a brush and shoot.
Are you kidding, Chief?
I might kill you.
Just make sure you hit the palette.
Well, okay, Chief.
Are you ready?
Ready.
Sorry about that, Chief.
Wrong brush.
Wrong brush.
Now, that's what I call the right brush.
Max, let's get back to the special equipment.
Now you see this tube of paint?
- Now you take it and squeeze it.
- Right, Chief.
Oh, on second thought, I'll do it.
This one is Carlson's favorite.
Hey, that's great, Chief.
I never knew Carlson was once a juvenile delinquent.
Max, remember, the man you have to find is Rembrandt von Bronzefinger.
Whoever he is, he's working somewhere in the museum.
Don't worry, I'll find him.
I've got a score to settle with Bronzefinger.
If you settled with him half as well as you settled with me, CONTROL will be well satisfied.
All right, Bronzefinger, drop the gun.
I'm a trained karate expert, and these hands are deadly weapons.
-  - Oh, excuse me.
Who is it?
It's me, Max.
- Give me the secret knock.
-  - Password?
- Bismarck.
- Countersign, Salt Lake City.
- Can I come in now?
Come on in, 99.
The door's open.
- Hello, Max.
- 99, what are you doing here?
It's after 10:00.
Oh, I was restless and I thought I'd take a walk.
You should be careful.
It's not safe for a girl to be out after dark.
Oh, Max, I'm a big girl.
Oh, I'm sorry, Max.
That's all right.
I probably weakened him while I was practicing.
Max, I'm really worried about you going to work at the museum.
Worried?
Why?
Oh, I would just hate to have you end up painted blue.
Oh, there there, 99.
If you really feel that way about it, why, I'll pick orange.
How's that?
It's just that sometimes I wish you were just an ordinary businessman.
Well, 99, we are what we are.
I'm a secret agent, trained to be cold, vicious and savage-- not enough to be a businessman.
Well, it's getting late.
I guess I'd better be going.
I guess you're worried about KAOS.
Forget about KAOS.
I have a very strict landlady.
And now if you'd like to follow me, I'm going to show you another masterpiece of the same period.
Actually, this painting is only on loan to the museum.
It's called "Young Girl at a Half-Open Door".
And here we have one of the museum's proudest possessions, "The Man in the Golden Helmet".
Now if you'd like to step to the south corridor, we can continue there.
Emile, I should like to introduce you to your new associate, Mr. Maxwell Smart.
Mr. Smart, this is Emile, our specialist in the Renaissance period.
And this is Wolfgang, our specialist in the Medieval period.
Hmph.
And here we have Victoria, our specialist in the lmpressionistic period.
And what is your period, Mr. Smart?
All periods.
I learned early in life not to play any favorites.
And, uh, here, Mr. Smart, is your work area.
You will restore this canvas.
As you can see, the paint is chipped in the corner.
Oh, it's a beautiful painting.
Who did it?
Brach, of course.
So there's a chip off the old Brach, eh?
Okay, let's get to it.
Good luck.
Uh, pardon me.
I wonder if you could tell me if there's a place to change.
Oh, certainly.
There's a utility closet right over there.
Thank you.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
Come in, CONTROL.
Hello, Chief?
This is Max.
I've made contact with the three suspects.
That's fine, Max.
Now listen, I just remembered something that Agent 54 told me.
The night he was killed, one of those three asked him to stay late.
It could happen again, so be careful.
Don't worry about me, Chief.
I'll be my usual alert, intelligent self.
That's what worries me.
Mr. Smart, I hate to mention it, but you forgot to glue the tear in the canvas before you repainted the spot.
How do you like that?
Now I'm gonna have to start all over again.
What a shame.
Why don't we stay late tonight?
We can finish it before Van Cleff has a chance to see it.
Mr. Smart, do let me borrow your red.
Huh?
Oh, yes, of course.
Here you are.
Thank you.
You know, I may have to stay a bit late this evening and finish things up.
You might stay with me, and perhaps we could have a spot of tea.
Ach!
This brush is like a club.
How do they expect me to stroke with it?
Don't tell me, let me guess.
You want me to stay late tonight so you can borrow one of my brushes.
Of course not.
Who needs you to stay late for that?
I borrow one of your brushes right now.
However I could use someone to help me refinish the frame.
If you could possibly stay a little later for that, I would be very grateful.
Have you found out anything, Max?
Yes, I've narrowed the three suspects down to three suspects.
Listen, Max, they're smuggling out another original tonight.
- Agent 13 found out about it.
- Where is Agent 13?
He's in the Dutch section.
I've got to go before they get suspicious.
- Hurry, Max-- the Dutch section.
- Right.
Psst!
I didn't recognize you with that fancy-looking helmet on.
- Do I look very funny?
- No, matter of fact it looks nice.
You don't think it's too much, huh?
Look, 13, I didn't come over here to talk to you about your helmet.
Now what have you found out?
Shh!
- Bronzefinger stole another original.
- When?
A few minutes ago.
I was looking at that cute little Dutch girl over there.
I bent down to fix my knickers and when I came up she was gone.
What do you mean, she was gone?
She's still there, 13.
That's not her.
That's a copy.
They can't fool me.
Where is that twinkle in her eye, that smile, and those cute little rosebud lips?
on the wall too long.
You can't stare at a girl for two weeks and not get involved.
Forget her, 13.
It wouldn't have worked out anyway.
Now look, we've got to crack this case.
Can you describe Bronzefinger?
No, I can't.
All I remember is the footsteps of the thief going toward the restoring room.
When I finished with my knickers, he was out of eyeshot.
What do you mean, out of eyeshot?
I can see up and down the entire corridor.
Uh-huh, but you're not in a frame.
All I can do is this.
I'm not allowed to do this.
I'm not a Pop-Art painting, you know?
-  - That's the museum's closing bell.
I've got to get out of here.
I've got an appointment in the restoring room.
You're not seeing my little Dutch girl, are you?
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course not.
My date is with Bronzefinger.
Emile.
So you're Bronzefinger.
Dead.
Well, that lets him out.
Now there's only Victoria and Wolfgang left.
Personally, it's my guess that it's Victoria.
Would you believe Wolfgang?
Painted to death.
No, Mr. Smart, it was none of them.
You see, I am - Bronzethumb!
- Bronzefinger.
A thumb is also a finger.
Okay, so you're Bronzefinger.
What about them?
They were KAOS agents too.
But they were going to sell out to you tonight.
However, all this information will do you no good.
You see, you'll never live to tell about it.
Wait a minute, Bronzefinger.
Where did you get that brush gun?
It's a standard KAOS weapon.
Oh, really?
Well, CONTROL happens to have a patent on the brush gun, and stealing a patent is a very serious offense in this country.
Sue me.
- Goodbye, Mr. Smart.
-  Too bad, Bronzefinger, your brush is empty.
The tube sword too.
Can't you guys ever invent anything on your own?
I'll tell you one thing-- KAOS is in for one big lawsuit.
We invented the tube sword first.
You stole it from us.
Swine!
Copycat!
- What does KAOS get for one of these?
- $50 apiece.
Is that wholesale or retail?
Bronzefinger is up to something.
I hope I'm not out of line, Bronzefinger, but just what do you think you're doing?
You're both about to be bronzed.
Okay.
Bronzed!
?
- All of us?
- All of you.
Oh.
I don't suppose you'd settle for just our baby shoes?
No, I wouldn't.
This is a timer, Mr. Smart.
It controls the position of the crucible.
Now after three minutes, the molten metal will turn you into an admirable pair of bookends.
Let the girl go, Bronzefinger.
She doesn't know anything.
- Max!
- I didn't mean it that way, 99.
- Goodbye, Mr. Smart.
-  I'll be back in three minutes, after it's all over.
You see, I cannot bear to hear a woman crying.
How do you feel about a man screaming?
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.
- Max, we've got to call CONTROL.
- Don't be silly, 99.
- He won't give us a phone.
- Your shoe phone, Max.
Oh, of course.
I forgot.
Here.
- Just kick it off with your foot.
- I've got it!
- Good good good.
- Here, I'll hold it and you dial.
It's the wrong shoe, 99.
- 99: Now we've got it.
- Pick it up with your leg.
Oh, I've got it!
Good girl, 99.
Don't drop it, now.
- There we go.
- Oh, good.
- Turn it around, let me dial.
- Okay.
- Hurry, Max, hurry!
- Believe me, 99, I'm not stalling.
Hello, this is 86 calling CONTROL.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
Hello, Chief, this is Max.
Get this and get this carefully: and we're about to be bronzed to death.
What?
Well, isn't this Oh, sorry.
Wrong number.
Now I know I dialed the right number.
That really burns me up.
-  - What are you doing?
- I'm dialing again, 99.
- Oh, Max, there's no time!
There's only one minute left!
Well, I guess this is it, 99.
Oh, no!
Max!
My razor ring!
I forgot it!
- We can't go home for it now.
- No, I forgot I had it.
Here, quick, pull that out with your fingernail.
Hurry!
- That's a stainless-steel blade.
- Oh, really?
How many ropes can you cut before changing blades?
I don't know.
I just got it.
Max!
Look at the time!
Hurry, 99.
It's almost through.
- Five seconds.
- No!
Max, it's spilling!
Max!
Oh, Max, how terrible.
Terrible for him, not for us.
I wonder what Bronzefinger would have done with us, Max.
Well, he probably would have sold us to some public park.
Just think of it, 99-- there we would have been, two bronze statues giving pleasure to thousands.
- Thousands of art lovers?
- No, thousands of pigeons.
You two have managed to deliver a real setback to KAOS.
I don't think I have to tell you how much this means to us.
- Tell us anyway, Chief.
- With Bronzefinger out of the way, KAOS will have to find a new method of getting money for their operations.
- Like what, Chief?
- I imagine they'll go back to bank robbery, extortion and kidnapping.
It'll be nice to have things back to normal again.
Oh, Chief, we found these paintings in Bronzefinger's office.
- Are they originals or copies?
- We don't know.
Put them in the wall safe.
We'll hold them for the museum authorities.
Right, Chief.
What's 13 doing in there?
The Chief said I'd been out on field trips too long, so he gave me this nice soft office job.
It's awfully small.
Tell me, 13, how did you get in there?
The Chief gave me the combination.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Shh.
He ducked down behind that packing case, 99.
- I wonder what made him suspicious.
- It's your squeaky shoes, Max.
- Maybe you should take them off.
- Good thinking, 99.
It's not my shoes.
I think it's my socks.
- Then take your socks off.
- I'd rather not, 99.
- Why?
- It might be my feet.
I'm bleeding!
It's only red wine, Max.
I'm bleeding red wine?
Max, he's getting away!
- I'm going after him, 99.
- You can't do that, Max.
Yes, I can.
He's out of ammunition.
A .
38 special only fires six shots.
What makes you think he's using a .
38 special?
Because, 99, I happen to be an expert on weapons.
I know the sound of a .
38 special and I counted six shots.
But, Max, you're making a terrible mistake.
-  -  You're the one with the .
38 special, Max.
I knew there was one around here someplace.
That must be the Chief.
Mmm, he'll have to make a break for it now, 99.
Max, Max!
Are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right, 99.
- Is he gone?
- I'm afraid so, Max.
- Max, look.
- Oh, he left the bird.
I wonder why he tried to kill him.
Because KAOS is vicious, rotten and cruel.
They'll stop at nothing to achieve their evil ends, even to shooting a harmless little bird.
KAOS forever.
KAOS forever.
Max!
He may be a harmless little bird, 99, but he's got a big mouth.
Here, Chief.
As you can see, the sailor in the alley is a man named Kosovich.
He's a well-known KAOS agent.
What I don't understand, Chief, is why KAOS would be smuggling information in on an old freighter.
What else is there?
We've jammed their shortwave radio, we've broken their telegraph code, and yesterday we took the last of their carrier pigeons into custody.
KAOS forever.
KAOS forever.
There's something very suspicious about that bird, Chief.
All he ever says is "KAOS forever, KAOS forever".
Exactly.
I think he knows more than he's telling.
There are ways to make a parrot talk, Chief.
Turn out the lights.
Max, isn't it a little ridiculous-- questioning a bird?
All right, you, talk!
Listen, are you gonna talk or am I gonna bring in the cat?
Now, Max, we don't want to use any third-degree tactics.
Oh.
Well, in that case, maybe I'd better use a different tack.
Turn on the lights, Chief.
All right now, you can talk to me.
I'm your friend.
go down to the supply room and get our little friend some crackers?
Right, Max.
- You see, Chief-- - Man: I must get in there.
Wait a minute.
I can't let you got in there.
All right, Harrison.
- Are you the Chief of CONTROL?
- I am.
- I am Creevley, A.S.P.C.B. - What?
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Birds.
- You're a lawyer, Mr. Creevley.
- That is correct.
And for your information, this bird is my client.
- What are the charges against him?
- Well, none.
Then I demand he be released at once.
Wait a minute.
How about consorting with known criminals?
That is guilt by association, which is clearly unconstitutional.
Look, Mr. Creevley, this bird may have important information.
You are detaining my client illegally.
Have you no respect for due process of law?
Now wait a minute, I brought this bird here myself.
Of his own free will?
I didn't exactly ask his permission.
By force.
I didn't twist his wing either.
Did you witness this?
Mr. Creevley, I can assure you that Max has treated this bird with the utmost courtesy.
It's not a question of courtesy.
This is a matter of civil rights.
Was this bird informed that anything he said - could be held against him?
- Well, no.
Was he advised that he could make one phone call?
We didn't even think about it.
Tell that to the Supreme Court.
We were merely about to question the bird.
You were?
Doesn't that seem cruel to you, grilling an innocent bird?
Oh, I expected to find heartlessness here, but not sheer idiocy.
Now just a moment, Creevley, there's no more idiocy here than there is in any other organization.
Please, Max, let me handle this.
Mr. Creevley, we are in business to fight KAOS.
That's why we want information from that parrot.
Then if you're the experts on KAOS, why don't you question each other instead of that bird?
Because he knows more than we do!
That doesn't surprise me.
KAOS forever.
KAOS forever.
You hear that?
This bird has seen and heard a lot.
Chief, just give me five minutes alone with him.
I'll file suit for a million dollars in damages if you touch one feather on that bird's body.
What exactly do you want, Mr. Creevley?
This is a writ of habeas corpus.
I suppose you know what that is.
Well, of course we know what that is.
Everybody knows what that is.
What is that, Chief?
It's a court order that compels us to hand over the parrot.
Do we have to, Chief?
I'm afraid so, Max.
It's a legal document.
Where are you taking him?
Anywhere he wants to go.
- Where is that?
- That is privileged information between my client and his lawyer.
KAOS forever.
KAOS forever.
Max, I want you to follow him and find out - where he takes that parrot.
- Right, Chief.
Oh, and be careful.
I don't want him to know you're following him.
Don't worry, Chief.
If there's one thing I know how to do, it's to put a tail on a bird.
Hey.
Hey, you.
You planning on buying that magazine?
This ain't a library, mister.
- Shh.
- That magazine costs 50¢!
Not so loud.
This ain't a library, mister.
Hey, there you go again.
I already paid for this magazine.
- I just put it back.
- Did you take it from there?
Yes, I did, but that doesn't mean I didn't-- It's used.
All right, I'll take a quarter.
- Chiseler.
- Deadbeat.
Hey, don't tie up the phone.
I'm expecting a call from my wife.
Hello, Chief?
This is 86.
-  - Hold on a second, Chief.
Hello.
Yes, could you hold on for a minute, please?
- Hey, is that for me?
- I'll be out in a few minutes.
That's a very important call.
Here.
- Hello, Chief.
- Hello, Gladys.
Listen, Chief, I followed Creevley until he passed the parrot on to a KAOS messenger.
He just went into a place called "Kilmen's Pet Shop".
I can't hear you, Gladys.
There's a guy talking into a shoe.
- He should be out in a few minutes.
- I don't know.
- It looks like a shoe phone.
- Not yet, Chief.
Gladys wants to know where you got the shoe.
CONTROL issue.
He says it's CONTROL issue.
- Not yet, Chief.
- What's CONTROL?
- Top secret.
- He says it's top secret.
Here he comes now, Chief.
Hey, she wants to know what your job is.
Hello, Gladys?
I'm a spy.
If I told you once, I told you 1,000 times-- ask a stupid question, get a stupid answer.
He hasn't got the parrot with him.
What do I want for dinner?
The parrot, Chief, the parrot.
How about parrot?
I mean-- pot roast.
How about pot roast?
Chief, the pot roast is still in there.
Look, I'll be over to CONTROL in a few minutes.
Look, I'll call you later.
Goodbye, Chief.
So long, Gladys.
Whew, why is it so hot in here, Carlson?
I'm sorry, Chief, our air conditioning broke down this morning.
Listen, Carlson, I'd like to use - the master identification file.
- What for?
I think I've got a lead and I'd like to check it out in the file.
Let him use the master file, Carlson.
But, Chief, that file is not a toy.
You know what happened to it last time he used it.
Do you really think you can find out anything important, Max?
Have I ever steered you wrong, Chief lately?
All right, Carlson, let Smart see what he can do.
Activate the master identification file.
Okay, Smart, it's all yours.
Now that's just a figure of speech.
Maybe you'd better tell me what you hope to find out, Max.
Well, Chief, that guy took the parrot to Kilmen's Pet Shop, and the name "Kilmen" rang a bell, so I'd like to run it through the machine and see what we get.
How long should this take, Carlson?
- 10 seconds if everything goes right.
-  Let's move over to the delivery slot and see what we get.
It's coming out, Max.
Don't pull it.
Let it come out by itself.
I know what I'm doing, Carlson.
I was right, Chief.
Take a look at that.
When the letters in the name "Kilmen" are rearranged, look what they spell.
- Melnik.
- Who's Melnik?
One of KAOS's top executives.
That's right.
He's known as "the smiling killer".
You gotta respect a man who enjoys his work, Chief.
Max, if Kilmen is Melnik, that means that the pet shop is a KAOS front.
Yes, and it means that Kosovich must be working out of it - and taking his orders from Melnik.
- That's right.
You and 99 get over there and see what you can find out.
Right, Chief.
Can we take Fang with us?
Good idea.
He'll be useful as a cover.
Oh, and incidentally, Max, you did a good job here.
Oh, thank you, Chief.
You see, Carlson?
- I told you I knew what I was doing.
- That's right, Carlson, - I think you owe 86 an apology.
- And he owes me about $80,000.
- What for?
- For repairs!
- Chief -  are you absolutely sure he's on our side?
Mr. Melnik, our messenger reports that he was followed here by a CONTROL agent.
Perfect, Kosovich, perfect.
It's as though we planned it this way.
- What do you mean by that?
- Well, now that CONTROL knows where the parrot is, they'll be sure to send an agent to investigate and KAOS will add another victim to its list.
Which agent do you think they'll send?
I don't know, Kosovich, I don't know, but we can always hope that it will be Maxwell Smart.
Maxwell Smart.
-  - Maxwell Smart, Maxwell Smart What are we gonna do, Max?
We haven't seen anyone go in or come out of there in over an hour.
We're just gonna have to take a chance and go in, 99.
If it is a KAOS front and if Melnik is operating it, we're bound to find incriminating evidence.
- How do you want to get in?
- Your skeleton keys.
- Let me have them.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Max, I left them in my other purse.
- I guess I'd better go weigh in.
- Right.
- Man: Put a penny in.
- What?
Put a penny in here.
What are you talking about, 13?
This is 86.
Open up.
Put a penny in the slot.
I don't have a penny.
I'll take a nickel.
a penny.
- What's the matter, Max?
- Oh, I don't know.
It's just that 13 is a pain sometimes.
Here.
Hi, 86.
Agent 13 here.
What have you got, 13?
Claustrophobia and flat feet.
I mean, what information do you have?
Oh, yeah.
Your weight's 150 and your fortune for today-- talking about?
How long have you been on duty in here?
Since about 2:00 this afternoon.
Have you seen anything weird or suspicious?
Not till you came along.
Where's your sense of humor, 86?
Listen, we think that Kilmen's Pet Shop is a KAOS front and that Melnik is operating it.
- "The smiling killer"?
- Yes.
have to go in there.
Let me borrow your skeleton keys.
Right.
Here, and that'll be a $20 deposit.
$20?
!
charges me.
let me have $20?
Oh, I'm sorry, Max, I left it in my other purse.
Well, here.
Take my watch as security.
Yeah, well, I don't know, 86.
It's a perfectly good watch.
Look at that.
One of Mickey Mouse's hands is broken.
- Let me have them.
-  Well, that's just what I needed-- a perfect end to a glorious day.
Come on, 99.
Max, don't you think we ought to check for alarms and booby traps before you use those keys?
Good idea, 99.
- Activate your Magneto Ring.
- Right, Max.
Here, can you attach it for me?
- Get anything?
- No, it's all right.
There's no electric eye, no alarm systems.
Good.
Now nothing can go wrong unless this lock is attached to some kind of a-- some kind of a-- - Some kind of a what, Max?
- Some kind of a-- Some kind of a trapdoor?
Exactly.
Good evening, Mr. Smart.
So good of you and your friends to To drop in, yes.
Get up.
There must be some fascinating explanation - for this unexpected visit.
- Okay, let's hear it.
Perhaps you wanted to make a purchase for your pet and you just couldn't wait for the store to open.
Say, that's not bad.
I'll buy that.
Come on, 99, let's get out of here.
Come on, 99.
We've decided to stay for a while.
What kind of a fool do you think I am?
Well, I don't know, just an ordinary everyday run-of-the-mill type fool, I guess.
Apparently you don't know who I am.
Yes, we do.
You're Melnik "The smiling killer".
At your service.
You know Kosovich, of course.
Hello again, Smart.
Yes, the last time I saw Kosovich he was showing his courage by trying to assassinate a parrot.
Yes, but you must understand these birds are vital to KAOS and we don't like the idea - of CONTROL getting ahold of them.
- Why not?
An excellent question, miss.
Thank you.
Now maybe you can give me an excellent answer.
Yes, of course.
Watch.
Man on tape: The formula for the new hydrogen rocket fuel is C2H2O7 subjected to antifiltration process and dual carbonic concentration.
- The formu-- - You see?
The recorder plays the information over and over.
The parrot memorizes it and then is dispatched to KAOS headquarters overseas.
Very clever, Melnik.
Too bad for you we found out.
Too bad for you, Mr. Smart, 'cause now we'll have to kill you.
I knew it was too bad for somebody.
- Take care of them, Kosovich.
- Right.
if you point that gun at us, Fang's gonna leap at your throat and tear you to pieces.
- Leap, Fang, leap!
- Leap, Fang!
Go ahead, Fang, leap.
Melnik: He doesn't respond too well.
Who taught him to leap?
- You did, Max.
- Oh.
Don't hurt the dog, Kosovich.
We'll send him to KAOS headquarters and retrain him.
Here, use this.
- What's that?
- A tranquilizer gun.
It slows up an animal's reactions so that he can be handled more easily.
-  - Somebody's at the front door.
I'll go up and see who it is.
You take care of them, Kosovich.
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.
Oh, by the way, I almost forgot -  -  Listen, Melnik, tell me one thing-- why do you always smile just before you kill someone?
I guess it's just because I like dealing with people.
All right, Smart, I'll make it easy on you.
- Where do you want it?
- Where?
I'll give it to you anywhere you want.
How about Philadelphia?
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.
Wait!
Before you shoot us, I'd like to ask for something.
- What is it?
- A goodbye kiss.
- Not him, Max, you.
- Oh.
Wait a minute, - that's not a bad idea.
- What?
An attractive man like Kosovich, a man of action, daring, strength-- I think I'd like to have him kiss me goodbye.
talk like that?
The man is a vicious rotten KAOS killer.
Everyone has their little faults, Max.
Is this some sort of a trick?
Would I trick you at a time like this?
I can't resist you.
It's those piercing black eyes, that cruel mouth.
Kiss me, Kosovich.
-  - Max, are you all right?
Yes, I'm all right, 99.
I've just been tranquilized.
All right, Kosovich, get up against that wall!
Hold it, 99.
Let me take care of this.
I've got a score to settle  with Kosovich.
Kosovich, that's the Chief of CONTROL up there at the door.
We gotta kill Smart and get out of here.
Kosovich!
Get out of the way!
- Chief, thank goodness.
- Larrabee, take him to headquarters.
- You got here just in time.
- It looks like that, 99.
But what's with Max?
What's going on here?
Oh, it's a little hard to explain, Chief.
You see, Max and Kosovich have been tranquilized.
- Tranquilized?
- Mm-hmm.
They've hit each other with tranquilizing pellets.
It should wear off in a couple of hours though.
He'll be all right, won't he?
Oh, sure, Chief.
He's just asleep.
Look how peaceful he looks, like a five-year-old child.
Yes, I know.
Sometimes it worries me.
Here, Max, put these tapes away.
We'll turn them over to the Defense Department tomorrow morning.
- Where do you want them?
- The wall safe behind the picture.
a report on tonight's activities.
- Right, Chief.
Usual procedure?
- Naturally.
- Three copies of the report.
- File the master copy - and burn the other two.
- Of course.
I've been meaning to ask you about that.
Why do we bother making extra copies - when all we do is destroy them?
- It's security procedure, 99.
Doesn't that strike you as being a little odd?
I used to think so too, but, well, it's all carefully explained in the CONTROL Standard Procedure Handbook.
May I have a look at that handbook sometime?
- I'm afraid not, 99.
- Why not?
We burned it.
Chief, I'm having a little trouble getting this picture up.
Max!
Uh, Chief, either this is the wrong picture or somebody stole your wall safe.
It's the wrong picture.
Have you got the new combination, Max?
New combination.
New combination?
!
Yes, according to standard security procedure we changed the combination yesterday.
Do you have it?
Well, I didn't memorize it, Chief, - but I had the usual three copies made.
- Where are they?
- We burned them.
- Oh, yes, of course.
Do you have the master copy?
No, I don't, Chief.
But I put it in a place where no one will get it.
Where, Max?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Well, Chief, Agent 59 reports everything's absolutely normal in South America.
- How normal?
- Two revolutions and one assassination.
- A quiet week.
- We've got everything under control.
I think we can lock up and go home for the weekend.
An excellent idea.
Oh, Chief, I forgot something.
I'd like to talk to you - about one more thing.
- What, Max?
I don't think we should talk right here in the open, Chief.
I think we should use the Cone of Silence.
Oh, Max, every time we use the Cone of Silence something terrible happens.
Can't you just write it to me on a piece of paper?
- People can read a piece of paper.
- I'll burn it afterwards.
- Ashes can be reassembled.
- I'll eat the note.
They could operate on you and get it back.
All right, Max-- the Cone of Silence.
Chief, could I work the controls this time?
All right, Max, but I'm warning you, this is your last chance.
Now what was--?
What was it you want to know, Max?
Chief, could you let me have $20 until payday?
You're gonna say you got me in this thing just to ask for money?
Are you out of your mind?
Are you serious?
Are you completely insane?
One question at a time, Chief.
Max, raise the Cone of Silence.
You're not angry, are you, Chief?
How would you feel if some simpleton used a Class-A security procedure merely in order to borrow $20?
!
I don't believe it!
Would you believe $30?
Max, raise the Cone of Silence!
I can't, Chief, the controls are outside.
Well, how are we gonna get out of here?
See if you can slip down under the Cone of Silence, Chief.
I can't, Max.
The arms of the chair touch the Cone of Silence.
Maybe I can slip out this side.
Okay, see if you can.
The emergency alert!
What happened?
Max, KAOS has sabotaged a nuclear reactor in the Midwest and it's running wild.
If it isn't stopped with 72 hours, there's gonna be a nuclear explosion.
My gosh, we could lose the whole Midwest.
We'd better get down to the lab and see Professor Carlson.
- Maybe he can give us some advice.
- Right, Max.
- Wait, 99.
I've forgotten something.
- What?
I can't remember.
It probably wasn't important.
- Come on.
- Let's go.
What do you mean you forgot?
With all the excitement about the nuclear reactor and everything, I-- Wait a minute, Chief.
You're not gonna let this affect my efficiency rating, are you?
I'm up for Agent of the Year, you know.
I should, but if you complete this mission successfully, - you still have a chance.
- Thank you, Chief.
I want that silver cup more than anything in the world.
How does the tooth cap feel?
Do you think it will stay in, Chief?
It will adhere to the tooth immediately.
It's made of a new tissue-thin plastic.
You won't even know it's in your mouth.
- Good, Chief.
- Now, Max, remember, If that nuclear reactor isn't fixed within 72 hours, it'll produce a devastating nuclear blast.
The plans to fix it are on microfilm in that cap.
It's a big responsibility, Chief.
It certainly is.
The future of the Midwest is in your mouth.
It couldn't be in a safer place.
Oh, come in, 99.
I was just briefing Max on the nuclear reactor mission.
Right, Chief.
I just picked up the train tickets for Chicago.
Train tickets?
I thought we were in a hurry.
We are, but the airport is fogged in, so you'll have to go by train.
I want you and 99 to pose a honeymoon couple.
Wait a minute, Chief.
Shouldn't we save the honeymoon cover until we have a mission at Niagara Falls?
No, Max.
Now KAOS will be right on your tail and they'll stop at nothing to get at that cap.
So be careful.
- Right, Chief.
- Oh, and one more thing-- this mission is so top-secret that for the next 72 hours you'll be entirely on your own.
You won't even be able to contact CONTROL.
You won't know me and I won't know you.
- Good luck, Max.
- I beg your pardon, I don't believe we've met.
- Max, where's the microfilm?
- In a cap in my tooth.
Oh, no.
I wish the Chief - hadn't done that again.
- Why not?
Don't you remember Agent 42 and Agent 18?
- They were both found dead.
- And toothless.
Max, don't look now.
I think those two men are KAOS agents.
There's one in a belted raincoat.
I think that's Ross Benito.
Don't be ridiculous, 99.
Not everybody in a belted raincoat is a secret agent.
I know that, Max, but I recognize them from the KAOS mugshots.
Well, there's only one way to find out.
- You stay here.
- Right.
- Well, Max?
- I think they're following me, 99, but I'm still not convinced they're from KAOS.
Now I'm convinced.
- You've gotta get rid of the tooth.
- You're right.
I can't take a chance on being caught.
- We'll have to split up.
Use Plan 4A.
- Right, Max.
- Hey, watch where you're going.
- Excuse me, - I'm sorry.
- What are you doing?
Psst.
- Are you all right, 99?
- I gave him the slip, Max.
What happened to the KAOS man that was following you?
- I eliminated him.
- What did you do with the body?
Cost me 20¢.
Remind me to put it on my expense account.
What did you do with the tooth?
I had to slip it in some guy's mouth.
Come on, let's go get it.
Right.
Man over P.A.: Your attention, please.
Train leaving for Columbus, Chicago and Joliet State Penitentiary - now boarding on track 4.
- All right, Franco, - Come on, let's go.
- All aboard.
to get that tooth back.
But, Max, how can you?
That man's in the penitentiary.
It's all very simple.
I've gotta get into the penitentiary, into his cell and into his mouth.
Max, why don't we just call the Chief?
I can't do that, 99.
You know I can't contact CONTROL.
This mission is too top-secret.
Besides, my reputation is at stake.
I'm up for Agent of the year.
But, Max, this is an emergency.
In 72 hours, that nuclear reactor will blow up.
The entire Midwest will go.
Well, 99, no one cares more about the Midwest than I do.
I'm sure that's true, Max.
- I'm not gonna let them down.
- I'm sure you won't.
After all, 99, some of my best friends are Midwesterners.
- Waiter!
- What are you gonna do, Max?
- I'm gonna have myself arrested.
- How?
By not paying the check.
I don't want you to be embarrassed, so you'd better get out of here.
Right, Max.
Good luck.
- Waiter?
- Yes, sir.
- Check, please.
- Hmm.
Thank you.
Now if you'll just call the manager But, sir, isn't the bill added correctly?
- Oh, it's added beautifully.
- Then what seems to be wrong?
Nothing, I'm just not paying.
Uh, I'm Mr. Schulman.
Is something wrong?
He-- he doesn't wanna pay the bill!
That's right-- I'm not paying the check.
So you might as well get it over with and have me arrested.
Well, sir, if you left your wallet at home I did not leave my wallet at home.
I deliberately came in here without any money!
Uh, well, perhaps you're a little short this week.
That's all right.
You can pay us next week.
We will trust you.
What are you talking about?
This is an open-and-shut case of premeditated fraud, and I demand justice!
Take it easy, sir.
Look, what's the trouble?
Did you lose your job?
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
It could happen to any of us.
I did not lose my job.
Now are you gonna have me arrested or am I gonna call the cops?
You don't want that kind of trouble.
Think of your wife.
Think of your kids.
Look, if you're having financial problems, why don't you let me help you out a little bit?
Me too, I'd hate to see a young man like you - turning into a no-good.
- How about it, folks?
- Let's help this young no-good out.
- Yeah, come on.
- Max!
- How do I look, 99?
- Oh, so handsome.
- I know that, 99.
- What I mean is, do I look dangerous?
- Oh, yes, Max, Very dangerous.
You've got to get arrested this time.
Don't worry.
It's as good as done this time.
Is that cop still around the corner?
- Yes, he is, Max.
-  - Max, someone else is coming.
- Good.
When I stick him up and yell-- and that cop is bound to hear him-- I'm as good as in jail.
Now you'd better get out of here, 99.
Right, Max.
All right, buddy, this is uh-- uh-- - a stickup?
- Right, a stickup.
Uh, go ahead, my boy.
Express your hostilities.
I am a psychiatrist, I understand these things.
- What are you talking about?
- What is it?
The same old story-- a broken home, feeling of rejection, a competitive mother?
Look, don't confuse me.
This is my first stickup.
Father fixation, sibling rivalry, inferiority complex?
Tell me, my boy.
Speak freely.
What is it you are trying to say?
I'm trying to say "hand over your money".
- You don't want my money.
- I don't?
No-oo, what you want is love, friendship, understanding, communication, a sense of belonging.
Police!
Yes, and you want the police too.
You are deliberately trying to get yourself arrested.
And do you know why?
You bet your sweet life I know why.
Police!
Guilt.
You are trying to punish yourself for crimes you are not even aware of-- your failure to your mother, your failure to yourself.
I don't believe this.
Are you gonna stick them up or aren't you?
My boy, there's no time to lose.
Mental health is passing you by.
In other words, you're not gonna stick 'em up.
Here is my card.
I'll see you at my office tomorrow morning at 9:00.
There you can talk openly and find out where you are really going!
If you had stuck them up in the first place, I'd be there already.
Hey, buddy, there's a law against littering.
I know it, Officer, and it's a darn good law.
What are you, some kind of a wise guy?
- What's your name?
- Maxwell Smart.
Listen, I can't hang around here.
I gotta go to work.
You'll stay right here while I finish writing out this ticket.
Look, copper, I don't have time for tickets.
Now beat it!
Listen, one more word out of you and I'll run you in.
- Oh, really?
- That's right.
Hold this.
Mr. Smart, I hope you realize that deliberately defying an officer is a serious offense.
Yeah yeah, I know, Your Honor.
I hope you throw the book at me.
Well, I don't think that's necessary.
Since this is your first offense, I'm letting you off - with a warning.
- A warning?
!
Now don't thank me.
Just see that it doesn't happen again.
- Case dismissed.
- Now wait a minute, Your Honor.
If you don't mind, I'd like to say a few words in my own defense.
All right, Mr. Smart.
Well now look, Your Honor, First of all, what I don't understand is how a nice white-haired, old fogy like you can let a litterbug like me loose in society.
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
Now, Mr. Smart, control yourself, or I'll cite you for contempt.
- You're a disgrace to the bench.
- That'll be 30 days.
- Suspended sentence.
- Suspended sentence?
!
This is an outrage.
What are you, on the take?
Listen, fellow, if you're looking for a bribe, forget it.
That'll be 90 days in the county jail.
Not enough.
How did you get your job?
Blackmail?
Let me tell you this much, buster-- I got a few friends in high places and I'm gonna see that you end up in night court in Staten Island.
That will be one year In the state penitentiary!
Thank you, Your Honor.
The defense rests.
All right, leave me alone.
I can walk.
Hello, sweetheart.
What do you know?
What do you say, kid?
Sit down, take a load off your feet.
Max, how are they treating you?
Like the common ordinary criminal I am.
I can't tell you what it does to me to see you in prison uniform.
Why?
What's the matter?
Doesn't it fit?
- Have you seen Franco?
- No, I can't get near him.
He's in with the murderers, and I'm in with the misdemeanors.
Oh, Max, you've absolutely got to get into his cell!
And when you do, you can use this.
- What is it, 99?
- It's a cake.
Oh, no, I'm on a diet.
Max, I baked dental instruments into the cake.
-  You did what?
!
- Shh, Max.
You baked dental instruments into the cake?
That's a fantastic idea, 99.
Where did you get it?
It's not so fantastic, Max.
It's an old trick, really.
People have been baking things into cakes for years.
You know, a horrible thought just struck me, 99.
- What?
- What if somebody thought of baking a file into a cake?
Why, it could disrupt our whole prison system.
- Come on, get down here.
- Don't push, don't push.
- Get over here.
- I'm warning you, you dirty copper, - Keep your filthy hands off me.
- Oh, come on over here.
Okay, that did it.
Hold this.
Listen, I hope I wasn't out of line with that crack about a filthy copper.
All right, Smart.
Come on, get in there!
Oh, hi.
I'm Maxwell Smart, your new cellmate.
Well, I'm Murray and he's Franco.
Hi, Murray.
Hello, Franco.
Gee, he's got a beautiful smile.
Are you kidding?
Franco-- he never smiles.
That's probably because he's got nothing to smile about.
Uh, Franco, listen to this one-- a funny thing happened on the way over to the prison.
- Knock it off.
- Knock it off?
He probably heard that one.
- How about-- - What's a young punk like you doing in my cell?
- I slugged a guard.
- You did?
For what?
Since when do you have to have a reason for slugging a guard?
Eh, that's the kind of talk I like to hear.
Why don't you grab that bunk?
It got a good mattress.
Wait a minute, Franco, you can't do that.
- That's my bunk.
- Shut up.
- Oh - Take my bunk, it's a nice mattress.
- Thank you very much.
- Knock it off, you two.
I'd like to have a little peace and quiet.
Franco is getting sleepy.
What are you doing?
Well, I was just-- I oughta beat your brains out.
Shh!
You'll wake Murray.
What's that thing on your head?
Well, it's just something I found in a chocolate cake.
What was you looking in my mouth for?
Well, you'll never believe this, Franco, but I'm a tooth collector.
You'll never believe this-- you know why I am in jail?
I murdered my dentist!
Chickie, the guard.
Franco, why did you murder your dentist?
If it wasn't for that fink, my uppers would be in my mouth instead of that glass over there.
Here's the cap with the microfilm.
Good, Max.
I'll get it to our Chicago contact immediately.
And you'll still have the chance to be Agent of the Year.
When is the Chief gonna get me out of here?
Oh, within 24 hours, I'm sure, Max.
There won't be any problem if you stay out of trouble.
Hmm, that's just perfect.
That will give me a chance to finish the license plate I'm working on in shop.
Over there.
- Hello, 99.
Chief.
- Chief: hello, Max.
- It was nice of you to come see me.
- Oh, you've done Such a wonderful job, Max.
We're so proud of you.
That's right, Max.
The whole country owes you its thanks.
The country is welcome, Chief.
And Max, it gives me great pleasure to bestow upon you the title - of Agent of the Year.
- Congratulations, Max.
Here's your silver cup, Max.
You've earned it.
Oh, gosh, Chief, That's awfully nice.
I don't know what to say.
What's this, Chief?
Oh, those are coffee grounds, Max.
We were one cup short in the office this morning.
Look, Chief, when am I gonna get out of here?
We're working on it, Max.
The wheels are in motion, but these things take time.
Time?
But I've been here for six weeks already!
I'll wait for you, Max.
Look, Chief, if the other guys in here find out who I really am, I could be in a lot of trouble.
Oh, no, that's all right, Max.
The Chief had a talk with the warden.
They figured out something to solve that problem.
- What?
- Solitary confinement.
Oh.
Well, that's swell, But look, Chief, I'd like to get back to CONTROL and go to work.
Max, I don't exactly know how to tell you this, but, - well, CONTROL does have certain rules.
- So?
One of them is against hiring ex-convicts.
Well, I've been prepared for something like this.
What do you mean, Max?
- I'm busting out of here tonight.
- how?
Well, I've learned a few things while I've been in here, and one of them is how to carve a piece of soap into a perfect imitation of a pistol.
It's a little small, isn't it, Max?
Well, I had to wash, didn't I?
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Insalata speciale alla Smart.
I prepared for you myself.
Oh, good.
I'm starving.
Get the girl.
Help!
Help!
I'm sorry, but this table is occupied.
Help me.
They are taking my mistress.
Well, that will teach you not to fool around.
The cops!
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you.
What a brave man you are, Mr. Smart.
Maxwell Smart.
Maxwell Smart.
It must have been fate that brought you here.
No, it was the salad.
I've got to go.
I must get out of here.
But the police are coming.
They'll want to know what happened.
Can't afford the scandal.
I'll find some way to repay you later.
But what about those men?
What were they trying to do?
Probably another kidnap attempt.
Another?
It happens all the time.
Fascinating.
Fascinating and beautiful.
And very low calorie.
I'm telling you, Chief, this was no ordinary kidnap attempt.
I happened to have recognized one of those hoods as a KAOS man.
- What's the man's name?
- I can't remember.
- What was the girl's name?
- I didn't get it.
What about the license number of the girl's car?
I didn't see it.
How about the license of the other car?
I didn't notice.
Max, what would you do if you were me and an agent gave you answers like "I can't remember," "I didn't notice," and "I didn't see it"?
I don't know.
What's the matter, Chief?
Another one of your headaches?
Listen, Chief, I'm sure that I can identify one of those attackers.
- How?
- Well, look, Chief the lab has perfected the new Idento-Man.
Oh.
How does it work?
Well, you see, Chief, the head is a huge electromagnet.
Now you take these various features and you put them on and you get - a three-dimensional figure.
- All right, let's get to it.
Now as soon as we can identify that man, we'll send out a tracer on him.
Then maybe we can find out who the girl is and what KAOS wants with her.
Right, Chief.
Okay, let's see now.
First of all, he had a very kind of determined chin.
And then a very cruel mouth and a mean moustache.
His nose was kind of crooked, Chief.
And then of course he had those bashed-in cauliflower ears.
The thing I saw most was those big beautiful baby-blue eyes.
What about the hair?
Oh, I didn't see his hair, chief, he was wearing a hat.
Well, try that one.
That's him, Chief.
That's the man I saw.
Now all we have to do is take his picture and run it through the automatic comparison file, and we've got our man.
Well, as soon as we can pin down the identification, I want you to look for the girl.
Because if he is a KAOS man-- Oh, he is a KAOS man, Chief.
I never forget a face.
And the face you've constructed looks like him?
I'm positive, Chief.
Then we'll put him on our 101 list-- "Shoot on sight".
Right, Chief.
Watch out, Chief!
There he is!
It's all right, Chief.
It's only the dummy.
Yes, I know.
- How am I doing, Little Joe?
- Wild, Tracy, wild.
Now you are doing the Tet.
Whoa whoa.
Hey, gang.
Got a new dance-- "the Leopard".
Excuse me, Miss Dunhill.
There are two gentlemen to see you.
I showed them into the library.
Slade, I told you never to set foot in this house.
And what is Caine doing here?
He's here because I asked him to be here.
He told me about the fake kidnapping attempt this morning, and I don't like it.
You didn't clear it with me.
I'm the head of KAOS in this district.
And I'm the head of the Daughters of KAOS.
A DOK takes command of any district she's in, and I am taking over the killing of Maxwell Smart personally.
Since when have you been interested in Smart?
Today is one year to the day since Maxwell Smart killed the founder of the United States branch of KAOS-- my father.
It seems only fitting that Smart should die on the anniversary of Daddy's death.
Why didn't you shoot him this morning when you had the opportunity?
I set up that fake kidnapping attempt to make contact with Smart.
Besides, shooting lacks imagination.
I want thrills, excitement, kicks.
Marvelous.
But when does he die?
Tonight.
And Smart's weakness is going to set him up for the kill.
We never found out Smart's weakness.
How could you know it?
He has the same weakness as every other man I've ever met-- me.
Hello there.
I've come to thank you, Maxwell Smart.
Won't you come in?
How did you find out where I lived?
I looked you up in the phone book.
Oh, you'd make a good detective, miss - Tracy Dunhill.
- Tracy Dunhill.
Yes, of course.
Aren't you the one they call "The Madcap Heiress," - "The Billion-Dollar Baby"?
- Just call me Tracy, Max.
"Tracy Max".
Well, couldn't we just make it "Tracy"?
See, my name is Max and it could get a little confusing that way.
You're right.
Do you always carry two fur coats?
Of course.
One is for wearing, the other's for dragging.
Miss Dunhill, I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but you're in terrible danger.
You see, I happened to recognize one of the men who tried to kidnap you this afternoon, and he's no run-of-the-mill ordinary kidnapper.
He happens to be a member of KAOS.
KAOS?
Yes, an international organization of evil.
Ooh, really?
How exciting.
Exciting?
Yes, I live for excitement.
And you, Mr. Smart, you look like the kind of man who lives for excitement too.
Well, yes, I guess you could say I'm a man of the world.
Do you like skin-diving Great sport.
gliding along the ocean floor Marvelous.
with only a spear gun in your hand Love it.
surrounded by man-eating sharks?
That I'm not too crazy about.
Oh, Max, I just know you're my kind of man and I know my friends are going to love you.
Why don't you come to my party tonight?
Oh, well, that's very nice of you.
I'd like to.
What time?
Any time.
It's been going on for two months.
Let's say about It will seem an eternity till then.
May I say, Mr. Smart, you have fantastic charm?
May I say, Miss Dunhill, that you have fantastic taste?
Good night.
Good night, Tracy.
Max, I can't leave.
Why not?
You're standing on my coat.
Smart will be here at 10:00.
How are you going to kill him?
Well, that's just what I'm going to work out.
Let's see I want something exotic.
No, something different.
That's it.
Lipstick.
Lipstick?
Yes.
This has the protective undercoating.
And this is the poison lipstick.
And when I kiss Smart-- get one of the boys in here.
Now.
Who can refuse a Daughter of KAOS?
Caine, Miss Dunhill wants to see you.
Yes, Miss Dunhill.
Caine, I never thanked you for this morning.
Thank you, Caine.
Quite dead.
Oh, yes.
Any doctor will think he died of a heart attack, but you and I will know that he was a victim of the Kiss of Death.
Get him out of here.
Max, I want you to be especially careful at Tracy Dunhill's party.
You've got to find out why KAOS wants her, and that means constant danger.
Oh, I don't know, Chief.
KAOS has its killers, kidnappers and blackmailers, but I don't think they'd crash a party where they weren't invited.
I think they might, Max.
How do you like that, 86?
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm not too thrilled about it.
Don't tell me you're not thrilled.
Last year, thanks to me, there were six CONTROL men on the list of I never heard of that list.
Of course you haven't.
It's a secret.
Everything I design is a secret.
That's why I am known as Tailor to the Spies.
Well, what about this?
Look at that.
It looks like it's been rewoven.
Don't touch that.
It's a bullet hole.
I spend weeks making these jackets and you agents go out and get yourself shot.
You have no regard for clothing.
The jacket is just fine.
Okay, the jacket's just fine.
Now where's the secret pocket for my gun?
Don't tell me.
I'll find it.
I can't find it.
There is no secret pocket.
You see?
He shouldn't get so emotional about his clothes.
Max, I had Agent 13 shipped into Tracy Dunhill's house.
Shipped?
We found out she'd ordered some new furniture.
Before it was delivered, I stationed Agent 13 inside a couch.
Oh, well that will be nice for 13.
Why?
Well, he's been working hard.
He could use the rest.
Will you stop it?
Oh, Max.
The lab man asked me to bring you this belt to wear to the party tonight.
Oh, thank you, 99.
It's the latest piece of special equipment.
The buckle contains a miniscule tape recorder.
What?
Miniscule-- diminutive, microcosmic.
Hmm.
You certainly have a way with words, 99.
Teensy-weensy.
Chief, I don't like this setup at all.
I think we ought to try to crash that party.
But if we attract attention, KAOS is sure to become suspicious.
Trust my feminine intuition, Chief.
Max is walking into a trap.
Now, 99, you don't think just because Miss Dunhill is terribly attractive and fabulously wealthy, that would affect Max's judgment, do you?
How long would it take you to change?
You're not as clever as you thought you were, my dear.
It's 10:00.
Smart isn't here yet.
Don't worry.
Smart will be here, and I will be ready for him.
First the protective undercoating.
Then the poison lipstick.
You're a very attractive woman, Tracy.
Oh, I just adore compliments.
I could kiss you for that.
Naughty.
Smart just came in.
You could take care of him right now.
A kiss hello, and it's goodbye, Smart.
I told you, Slade, I will take care of Smart in my own way at my own time.
Smart dies at exactly the moment that he killed my father-- Midnight.
Hello, Max.
I'm so glad you could come.
I want you to meet some of my guests.
Oh, thank you, Tracy, but I think I'll just look around for a little bit.
Don't forget, your life may still be in danger.
Oh, that's right.
Don't you disappear.
I've got a great surprise for you later.
Good.
I'm looking forward to it.
Good evening.
dressed like this.
My glasses are too dark and my cummerbund is too tight.
But, Chief, you'll fit right in with the crowd.
Who are all these strange-looking people?
A bunch of international parasitic sycophants.
Hey, Max was right.
You do have a way with words.
Hi there, 88-66.
It's just 86.
Well, I'm seeing double right now.
I'm surprised at you, 13.
You're supposed to be working on a case.
I'm on my second case.
I finished my first case an hour ago.
Well, at least you found a clever place to hide.
Yeah, no, not really.
Half a dozen people have seen me already.
Well, how do you explain yourself?
I don't have to.
With this jet-set crowd, a guy in the sofa is just normal.
I guess you're right.
Yeah, there's a Swedish actress sleeping in the wall safe.
Listen, 13, do you have anything important to report?
Oh, you bet I have, 86.
I discovered something that's so important, it's a matter of--  excuse me.
It's a matter of life and death.
Unfortunately, I don't remember what life or whose death, but Oh, hi there.
Ah, thank you.
Who was that?
Oh, that was Agent 93.
Since I had to keep surveillance at a party, the Chief was nice enough to let me take along a date.
Well, I'll see you around, 86.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, 13.
Try to remember what you've overheard.
But I-- I-- I know what-- Shh.
Someone's coming.
Hello, Max.
Having a good time?
Yes, but I'm waiting for that surprise you promised me.
You won't have long to wait.
Well, I hope it will be worth waiting for.
You will never forget it.
I don't like the looks of that, Chief.
I'm sorry, 99.
I'm new at this kind of dancing.
I'm doing the best that I can.
No, I mean Max and that woman.
Let's dance over that way.
Okay, but you lead.
Hold it down, everybody.
Quiet!
The party's getting dull.
We need something to celebrate.
And we are going to celebrate the New Year!
But the New Year is months away.
The man is right.
That's what we are going to celebrate-- the fact that the New Year is months away!
-  -  Oh, Max, you know what is so exciting about New Year's?
Everybody kisses at midnight.
Good.
Then I'll see you at midnight.
You know, 99, this is some party.
I hope Max is all right.
- Oh, I'm sure he is.
- I don't know, Chief.
I haven't been able to reach him for over an hour.
Every time I tried to, that man started talking to me.
Did you find out who that girl is?
No, but I'm certain she's a CONTROL agent.
You're playing a very dangerous game, Tracy.
In 30 seconds it will be midnight, and that's when Maxwell Smart gets his kiss.
Come on, 13, try and remember again.
I can't take this party much longer.
The noise is killing me.
- That's it!
- What's it?
That's the thing that I couldn't remember.
You're going to get killed tonight.
Tonight?
But it's almost midnight.
Midnight?
Well, look, if I don't see you again, happy New Year!
Tracy: Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!
Max, Max, over here!
Tracy, how about a kiss?
Happy New Year!
No!
Max happy New Year.
Happy New Year.
I did it.
I killed Maxwell Smart, and exactly at midnight, just as I said I would.
My apologies.
You are a true Daughter of KAOS.
And that's the end of Maxwell Smart.
No, that's the end of Tracy Dunhill.
I have your confession right here in my teensy-weensy tape recorder.
You're supposed to be dead.
Yes, I know, but when Agent 13 told me that I was gonna be killed tonight, and when I saw you kiss that man outside, I put two and two together.
But I was wearing poison lipstick when I kissed you.
What saved you?
Plastic lips.
Thanks to the boys in the lab, I can kiss and tell.
Good morning, Chief.
Morning, 99.
Chief: Good morning.
Well, Chief, I checked with the legal department.
And Tracy Dunhill is going to prison for a long long time.
- I should think so.
- Yes, they got her on two charges of manslaughter and one of kissing with a deadly weapon.
Congratulations, Max.
You did a fine job in gathering evidence against Tracy Dunhill.
And loving it.
Oh, come on now, 99.
You don't really believe I liked her and her phony friends.
Funny you should mention that.
What are you talking about?
I have your teensy-weensy tape recorder.
Max on tape: Hello there.
What's your name?
Woman on tape: My name is lvana, and I'm a ballerina.
Max on tape: And I'm Maxwell Smart, eccentric millionaire and patron of the arts.
It so happens she was 60 years old.
Would you believe Max on tape: But how could mam'selle get so pretty in just 19 years?
All right, Max.
You two settle your differences outside.
I've got work to do.
just let me explain.
Go ahead, Max, I'm listening.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hello, Chief, this is 86.
- What is it, Max?
- I found Walters.
He was in a rundown bar on Front Street.
- He just left.
- Is he all right?
Well, Chief, he looks in pretty bad shape.
I think he's at the end of his rope.
Stay with him, Max.
Walters is a fine man and a good agent, but in his present state he's a menace to the entire organization.
Right, Chief.
I'll stick with him.
- Off and on.
- Don't you mean "Over and out"?
No, when I sign off I put my shoe on.
Hello, Chief.
Max.
Walters is on the Interborough Bridge.
- What's he doing?
- Well, either he's contemplating suicide or he's a health nut.
Max, you've got to talk him out of it.
Now the first thing to remember is act nonchalant.
Right, Chief.
Say, pal, you got a match?
Oh, it's you, Walters.
Uh, taking a little breath of fresh air before turning in?
I told you to stay away from me, 86.
Come on, Walters.
Come on down from there.
We all miss you back at CONTROL.
It's no use.
I'm no good.
I've lied, cheated and stolen.
And I've betrayed my country.
Well, Walters, we all have our weak moments.
It's not that bad.
It was all for her.
What are you talking about, Walters?
You must believe me, 86.
I couldn't help myself.
From the moment I first saw her I couldn't resist her.
- Chief: Max.
- Yes, Chief.
Remind him of his duty.
Right, Chief.
Now look, Walters, as the number-two man in CONTROL, you're not acting very rational.
Who asked you to do what?
Octavia, you fool!
Octavia!
Now, look, Walters, why don't you come down from there and we'll talk about it?
Keep away!
There's nothing to talk about.
Chief, he's getting ready to jump.
What'll I do now?
Use reverse psychology.
Pretend to agree with him.
Get him angry.
Right, Chief.
- Now listen, Walters-- - I'm warning you, 86.
- It won't take much to make me jump.
- Good.
I absolutely agree with you.
As a matter of fact, if I were in your position that's what I would do.
- What?
- Well, you said so yourself.
You're no good to anybody anymore, not even yourself.
- The best thing to do is take a dive.
- Now wait just a minute.
Go ahead, you bum, jump!
I dare you!
Max: It worked, Chief!
You know, the thing that bothers me about all this is the pattern that's beginning to form.
What are you talking about, Chief?
Well, all of those men who got into trouble were the number-two men of CONTROL.
First Washburn, then Meadows, now Walters.
We were discussing the international code for hours.
And that very night he started drinking and disappeared.
- Chief?
- Yes, Max.
- Could it have been something you said?
- No, Max.
One person alone is responsible for the ruination of those three men-- Octavia.
Chief, I've never seen anyone like this before-- those evil penetrating eyes; cold, ruthless mouth; defiant chin; strong, unyielding body.
- Chief?
- What?
I think I'm in love.
Max, we've got to find a pattern in her method of operation.
What I don't understand, Chief, is why it's always the number-two man.
I would think that the CONTROL master code would have a great deal to do with it.
You see, our number-two man has complete say-so over when and how often it's to be changed.
Well, then that means that our new number-two man - will be her next victim.
- Exactly.
That's why we've got to find something in these files that will help us set a trap for this vicious woman.
- Did you want to see me, Chief?
- Yes, we can use your help, Hymie.
- Hello, Hymie.
- Oh, hello, Max.
- What's the matter with you, Hymie?
- I don't know.
I guess I'm just a little rundown.
When was the last time you charged your dry cells?
- Last week.
- Well, go charge your batteries.
Now Washington has decided that the next number-two man will come right from the ranks of CONTROL.
- Someone from this building, Chief?
- Exactly.
- No more political appointments.
-  They want to make sure the next man is well-trained for the job.
Here, Max, give these reports to Hymie and have him memorize them.
- I needed that.
- Good, Hymie.
Now come with me.
Sit down.
I want you to take these reports and start filing them in your memory bank.
Yes, Max.
Chief, when are they gonna let us know who the new man is?
-  - That must be it.
What in the world is that, Chief?
It's our horn phone.
Do you mean this is coming right from the White House?
That's right.
Hymie, would you knock that stuff off?
Hymie, the Chief didn't mean that.
He meant just to be quiet while he's on the horn phone to the White House.
- I'm sorry, Max.
- Shh!
Shh.
Yes, sir.
The new number-two man is who?
Are you sure?
Oh, sorry, sir.
Goodbye.
Who is it, Chief?
Hymie.
He had a perfect score on the achievement test.
Hymie?
Why, that's wonderful.
Wait a minute, Chief.
Hymie can't be the number-two man of CONTROL.
Why, if anybody ever found out he was a robot we'd be the laughingstock of the world of espionage.
Wait a minute, Chief.
On second thought, a robot might be an improvement.
You might be right, Max.
As a robot he would be completely immune to Octavia's evil charms.
We might be able to trap her at last.
Congratulations, Hymie.
Wait a minute.
What about the doctor?
Hymie has to have a physical examination before he can accept the office.
Well, Chief, I'm sure that the CONTROL doctor would be willing to go along with us on a thing like this.
No, Washington wanted an impartial doctor to make the examination, someone not connected with the government in any way.
Oh, I have his name here on a piece of paper.
Dr. Louis Pasteur.
That name sounds oddly familiar, Chief.
Come on, Hymie, let's go see that doctor.
And don't worry, Chief, I'll get Hymie through that physical.
- How, Max?
- It's really quite simple, Chief.
You see, I've got imagination, ingenuity and intelligence.
And a headache you wouldn't believe.
I am extremely tired, gentlemen.
I kept this office open three hours later than usual waiting for you.
I hope you appreciate that.
We certainly do, Doctor.
We certainly do.
Right.
Well, then let's get on with it, shall we?
- Where are my glasses?
- Glasses?
Oh, come on, Doctor, don't tell me you wear glasses.
Why, you shouldn't wear glasses.
You've got such beautiful eyes.
They're so big and blue too.
Now look here, Doctor.
How many fingers do I have up?
- Huh?
- Congratulations.
You passed.
Now could we get on with the examination?
Yes, all right.
Now, uh, what is your name?
- Hymie.
- Hymie what?
That's his code name, Doctor.
Oh.
Do you drink?
Only a little oil now and then.
"A little oil now and then".
"A little oil now and then".
That's very funny, Hymie, but this is no time for jokes.
The doctor is very tired and wants to go home and get a good night's sleep.
- I'm sorry, Max.
- Do you smoke?
Only when I drink cheap oil.
I'm sure we have all this information down at CONTROL headquarters.
Why don't we get on with the physical examination, huh?
An excellent idea.
Excellent.
Would you mind stepping on the scale?
Did I say 982 lbs?
No, you said - 182.
- Oh.
- What's next, Doctor?
- Next, uh, next.
Well, let's check his heart.
Jump up on the table, please.
Just send the bill to CONTROL.
We'll take care of it down there, Doctor.
Hymie, come over here.
The doctor wants to check your ears.
Pasteur: Let's take a look here.
I'm going to prescribe a couple of aspirins and a good night's rest.
Why?
Is there anything wrong him, Doctor?
Oh, no, there's nothing serious, just a lot of gears and levers in his head.
Well, doctor, if you'll just sign this release here, we'll be on our way.
All right.
By the way, doctor, here are your glasses.
Oh oh, thank you.
Thank you very much, doctor.
Come on, Hymie, let's get your clothes and get out of here.
Gears and levers in his head.
I've gotta cut down on those health foods.
If these designs meet with your approval, Octavia, we'll put the finishing touches on them and they'll be in your wardrobe within 24 hours.
The evening gown and the peignoir are fine.
Have that walking suit made out of herringbone tweed rather than check.
Certainly, Octavia.
-  - Yes?
- Man: Number One here.
- What is it?
Octavia, I do wish you would say "sir" when you speak to me.
It sets a bad example for the others.
I say "sir" to no man.
What do you want?
CONTROL has selected a new number-two man.
We don't want this one destroyed.
Bring him back here with you.
Is that clear?
Have you ever had to tell me more than once?
No, but-- - Man: Aircraft.
- Have my plane ready in 20 minutes.
Yes, Octavia.
Where will you be going?
To Washington.
Another CONTROL agent is about to meet his doom.
Hi, Chief.
Where's Hymie?
Oh, Hymie's in the lab being reprogrammed for an executive-type attitude and personality-- hard, cold, efficient.
Octavia won't have a chance.
Oh, hi, Hymie.
Gee, you look nice.
Somehow it's hard for me to picture you as an executive.
You just don't seem the type.
I believe I am adequately reprogrammed to cope with this assignment.
Oh, good.
You'll be operating out of your apartment, Max.
Right, Chief.
Come on, Hymie, let's go.
Don't touch my body.
- Familiarity breeds contempt.
- Don't touch your body?
But I've put my hand on your shoulder lots of times.
You never said anything about contempt.
If we are to continue working together, Maxwell, it must be strictly impersonal and businesslike.
But, Hymie, we've always been friends.
I wasn't an executive then.
Now things are going to be different.
- 86.
- Huh?
You haven't much stamina, do you, 86?
What are you talking about, Hymie?
I was just resting my eyes.
You were sleeping on the job.
I wish I were sleeping on my bed.
What are you doing?
Giving you a demerit.
- A demerit?
- 10 demerits and you're dishonorably discharged, page 127, paragraph four, "CONTROL Constitution and Bylaws".
Well, that breaks it.
I'm going to bed.
I believe as number-two man in CONTROL I am entitled to the choice sleeping accommodations.
Hymie, I'm going to bed in my own bed.
We'll see about that.
Hello, Chief.
Time to get up.
What time is it?
- 5:00.
- 5:00.
Now look, Hymie, I know you're trying to do a good job, but this is ridiculous!
We'll be to the office before the cleaning woman.
Why so early?
To study Octavia's pattern during the past few years to determine how and when she'll attack next.
Look, Hymie, I don't know about you, but I can't operate without sleep.
I'm not a machine, you know.
Sorry about that, Hymie.
Sticks and stones may break my bones Will you stop that?
I said I was sorry.
Hitting an executive-- Come on, Hymie, let's go.
Hymie, come over here.
You've got me down for nine demerits.
I don't suppose you'd consider starting from scratch?
- No.
- Okay for you.
Let's go.
That's it, Max, you're out.
Come on.
Oh, Hymie, snap off that light, will you?
-  - Come in.
May I straighten up your office now, Mr. Hymie?
Yes, please.
I'll try not to disturb you.
That's all right.
Hymie?
Oh, hello, Octavia.
I've been expecting you.
You have walked into our trap and reached the end of your evil road.
You are powerless against me.
I always knew that one day I'd be caught.
I'm glad you were the one, Hymie.
Flattery will get you nowhere.
Now that you've put an end to my evil life of crime, may I express my appreciation?
If you like.
Look, Chief.
Max, what's been going on in here?
These look like the clothes the cleaning woman was wearing.
Max, look at this.
So that's how Octavia did it.
Why, she's been right under our noses all the time, Chief, - disguised as a cleaning woman.
- This is terrible.
I know.
Good cleaning women are hard to get.
- What's this, Chief?
- Looks like a lady's compact.
Octavia must have left it behind.
I don't believe it.
I just don't believe it.
- What are you talking about?
- It's almost impossible.
Chief, if I'm right, Hymie could be in very grave danger.
Here.
We'd better take these.
Right.
Have it ready for take off in 30 minutes.
There will be two of us.
I'm signing off now.
- Hi.
- Hi.
May I try that?
I guess we're not wired the same.
Wouldn't it be boring if we were?
May I?
Now as soon as you put all those papers in your briefcase, Hymie, we can go.
I've never met anyone like you, Octavia.
I've never met anyone like you, Hymie.
- You're different somehow-- - Thank you.
--the cute little way you click your eyes, the way you make my gyros race whenever you kiss me, the way my oil boils when you're near.
Hymie, what are you doing with those papers?
Hello, Maxwell, I was just going to give them to Octavia.
Listen, Hymie, I'm your friend so I'm gonna give it to you straight.
Octavia doesn't care a thing about you.
She's just using you to get information from CONTROL.
She'll throw you on the scrap heap the first chance she gets.
Hymie doesn't believe that.
It's all over, Octavia.
You've victimized your last number-two man of CONTROL.
We're leaving.
Come, Hymie.
Hymie, stay right where you are!
Come here, Hymie.
Isn't she wonderful, Max?
So strong yet so feminine.
- Coming, dear.
- Over my dead body.
That can be arranged.
Quick, Chief, the force-field unit!
- Okay, Chief?
- Yes, I'm all right.
- Are you all right, Hymie?
- Yes, Maxwell.
What a magnificent piece of construction.
What a pity she doesn't work on the side of law and goodness.
Thank heaven you knew that compact was a miniature robot tool kit, Max.
Yes, well, you see, Chief, Hymie carries the same sort of tool kit in his wallet.
Be careful, Chief, don't step into that force field.
No, I won't, Max.
Much as I hate to do it, I'm afraid she's going to have to be disassembled.
Mmm, poor Hymie.
She would have made a good friend for him.
Stay here with me, Octavia.
- We can have you reprogrammed.
- I wish I could, Hymie.
You're the only one I've ever met that had anything inside.
Then stay.
There's too much against us.
For one thing, our grounds are different.
I'm plus and you're minus.
So what?
As long as we have each other.
Can't you see?
People would point at us and say, "Disgusting-- he's positive and she's negative".
They'd never leave us alone.
Then we'll move away, live by ourselves.
For how long?
Sooner or later, you'd need a new tube, I'd need a condenser.
Then we'll move again.
That would be all right for the next 200-300 years, Hymie, but I want something permanent.
See, it just won't work.
You can't return to KAOS.
I know.
It would be impossible after knowing you.
Then what are you going to do?
I have that all figured out.
I'm going to miss you, Octavia.
And I you, Hymie.
- Before you go may I--?
- Of course you may.
Goodbye, Hymie.
Here, Hymie, drink this.
- Thanks, Max, I needed that.
- Me too.
Grief, what was that?
Hymie's special blend-- kerosene and oil.
It's no use, Chief.
Hymie won't come out of the lab.
He's taken this Octavia affair pretty hard.
- How long has he been in there, Max?
- A week, ever since he resigned his position as second-in-command of CONTROL.
Well, you should be able to talk to him.
You're his best friend.
Well, I'll try, Chief.
- Are you all right, Hymie?
- We were worried about you.
- I'm all right.
- Well, you look awful.
And you're squeaking.
Have you been taking your oil lately?
I have failed.
I have tried and tried, but I have failed.
What are you talking about, Hymie?
How have you failed?
I was so lonely for Octavia, I thought I could find a substitute, but the best I could do was this.
Hymie, you mean to say you rebuilt her all by yourself?
Yes, sir.
I wonder if in your spare time you'd-- never mind.
Why, Hymie, she's just as beautiful as ever.
Why, she's perfect.
No, she's not.
Say hello to Max and the Chief.
Max's voice: Hello, Max.
Hello, Chief.
Hymie told me all about you.
So what's wrong with that?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Hey, buddy, got a cigarette?
Uh, yes, I do.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
Could I borrow one of your cigarettes?
Oh, certainly.
- Where are you hit?
- In the arm.
I'd better put a tourniquet on that.
Give me your arm.
Wait a minute.
Max: KAOS, eh?
Then that bullet was meant for me.
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about this KAOS emblem on your back.
Where did you get it?
- How did that get there?
- "How did that get there"?
Are you trying to tell me you don't know how that tattoo got there?
You can't expect a fella to remember everything.
All right, get on your feet.
I'm taking you downtown for questioning.
All right, Smart, but I've got news for you: You're not gonna live through the day.
You got a price on your head of a quarter of million dollars.
A quarter of a million dollars?
You're kidding.
No, I'm not kidding!
Is that American money or KAOS scrip?
American money!
With that kind of a price on your head every killer in the country is gonna be after you.
You don't stand a chance!
Oh, really?
Well, I've got news for you, fella: anybody who tries to collect that reward is gonna have to do it over my dead body.
Siegfried: You fools!
Incompetents!
Bunglers!
Dummkopfs!
Sissies!
You call yourselves killers?
You are not worthy of the name.
In the past three weeks Maxwell Smart has personally eliminated no less than 11--  Do you hear me, stupids?
Maxwell Smart has personally eliminated no less than 11 of our most vicious, brutal, cold-blooded agents!
Some of whom were my best, dearest, sweetest, kindest friends.
And all because of your bumbling stupidity!
But let me tell you this-- Who is responsible for putting this pitcher over here?
This is another example of your stupidity!
It belongs over here.
Now we did our best to try to disguise our better-known agents.
Maxwell Smart recognized them like this.
Now listen to this-- I am still offering $250,000 for Maxwell Smart, dead or alive.
If-- correction!
Dead or dead!
This reward may act as an incentive to other organizations of evil to try to make an honest buck.
Now get this through your thick nitwit skulls!
I warn you as of right now, if Maxwell Smart is not killed within 48 hours the Annual KAOS Bingo Party and Barbecue is canceled!
Max, I don't blame you for being nervous.
KAOS is very anxious to get rid of you.
A quarter of a million dollars, and tax-free.
That's an enormous reward, the biggest I can remember.
I know.
I'd make an attempt to collect it myself if I could figure out a way to live through it.
Max, the important thing is for you to be more careful than you've ever been in your life.
You're right, Chief.
This whole thing is beginning to get on my nerves.
The news is all over CONTROL.
Why, do you know that the boys in the lab have a pool to guess how long I'll be alive?
Wait a minute, Chief.
You don't suppose that anybody in CONTROL would make an attempt on my life, do you?
I think you ought to get of town for a while.
- Why?
- Max, you're very tense.
I think you can use the rest.
Look, Chief, I'm not gonna run away and hide.
Max, your nerves are shot.
You don't know who are your friends or who are your enemies.
Next thing you know, you'll be suspecting me.
That's not true, Chief.
If there's one thing in this world I'm sure of it's the fact that you and I are friends.
Well, I should certainly hope so.
-  - All right, now, just take it easy.
One false move and you're a dead man.
Pull your hand out of your pocket slowly.
Sorry, Chief.
Don't ever pull a handkerchief on a friend.
Max, I'm worried about you.
You really are jumpy.
Don't worry about me, 99.
I'll be all right.
Max!
It's just a car backfiring.
I know that, 99.
- I was just practicing.
- For what?
For the CONTROL Track Meet.
very strange about that car.
Max, they tried to kill us.
So, that's what it was.
- Did you get the license number?
- No, Max.
I wonder if it was a KAOS car or a CONTROL car.
What are you doing, Oh, Max, I'm hunting for my Electronic Finder.
Agent 13 is in the area and we're supposed to locate him and get his report.
Oh, okay.
-  - Listen, Max.
Max, I think he's in the vending machine.
I think you're right, 99.
You stay here and let me know if you see any suspicious cars coming.
Right, Max.
- Is that you, 13?
- No, it's the Abominable Snowman.
Of course it's me.
All right, what have you got, 13?
You name it-- pneumonia, bronchitis, frostbite, the flu.
Look, 13, I feel very sorry for you but I'm in a hurry.
I don't know, 86.
I've got to get out of the spy business.
I'm supposed to be a secret agent, not a penguin.
Look, 13, have you seen any KAOS agents loitering around here in the neighborhood?
Well, what's the matter now?
You could at least say gesundheit.
- All right, gesundheit.
- It's too late now.
The reason I ask about the KAOS-- I haven't had such a chill since I asked the Chief for a raise.
I'm asking you, -  - Gesundheit!
Yeah, now you're talking.
All right, what's your problem, 86?
KAOS has offered a quarter of million dollars for my death!
Wow, with that kind of money I could retire in Florida or Arizona.
The last gesundheit he gets out of me.
- 99, look at that.
- What, Max?
Well, don't you see anything unusual about the way that man is walking?
Not particularly.
He favors the ball of his right foot, like a man who's been raised in goat country and has had to walk sideways up hills a lot.
There's only one man in the world who has a distinctive walk like that.
- Who, Max?
- His name is Valdez and he's one of KAOS's top assassins.
I'd know that walk anywhere.
You'll see, 99.
He has an evil face, a big black mustache and a scar running across his right cheek.
- What are you gonna do, Max?
- I'm going after him, 99.
- You stay here.
- Max, be careful!
All right, Valdez, on your feet!
Would you get off of me, mister?
I think you've broken my arm.
Sorry about that.
You see, I thought you were an old friend.
Max, eat your soup.
It's human to make a mistake.
new around here?
I haven't seen him before.
Why?
I don't like his looks.
How is your soup, Fine.
Here, try mine.
- Fine.
- Oh, I thought it was poisoned.
All right, fella, now just what did you have in mind for this stiletto?
It's for that gentlemen's steak.
Oh.
Sorry about that.
There.
Let's skip lunch, Max.
Maybe you're right, 99.
Come on, let's go.
- Hold it, 99.
- What is it, Max?
That man over there.
That's a man?
Yes, it's a brilliant disguise, 99.
But that so-called woman is actually Melvin Forester, bagman for the KAOS syndicate.
Notice the twitching in the neck muscles.
That's the giveaway.
Max, don't you think you'd better have a look at Melvin's face - before you do anything?
- We don't have time, 99.
I've gotta get him before he sees us.
Max, you're already up on one count of assault and battery.
Shh!
would you believe two counts?
Max, you need a rest.
You can't go around jumping on innocent people.
Besides you're in greater danger all the time.
What do you mean?
Well, they raised the price on your head to $500,000.
$500,000?
That's a half a million dollars.
That's terrible, Chief.
I mean a quarter of a million dollars is reasonable price for killing a man, but a half a million dollars caters to greed.
KAOS must be getting frantic.
You're probably closer to breaking this case than you think.
I don't think so, Chief.
- Why do you think the price was raised?
- Inflation.
Max, I want you get out of town for a while.
Go to some nice resort somewhere and relax.
Swim, play some tennis, take a girl out dancing.
Chief, what are you talking about?
You can't ask me to give up my career, to give up a life of adventure and intrigue to go to some country club and become a has-been, lie around playing golf and tennis.
- And besides - What?
I've got nothing to wear.
Maybe now I can get some rest.
Who is it?
It's me, Max.
Who's me?
How do I know you're not someone pretending to be 99?
You don't.
Oh.
Well, what do we do now?
Why don't you look at me through the peephole?
Good idea.
Max.
- Are you alone?
- Yes.
Good.
- Come in, 99.
- Thank you, Max.
Okay, 99, what's up?
- I came to say goodbye.
- To whom?
To you.
The Chief said you were going away for a rest.
- I'll miss you, Max.
- Oh, thank you, 99.
You're welcome.
I guess I'd better be getting back to CONTROL.
- Uh, 99?
- Yes, Max.
I don't suppose you'd consider leaving by the window.
No, thank you.
Well, so long, 99.
All right, start talking!
Who are you?
Max, it's me, Joe Freebish, Agent 63!
Are you kidding?
I've known Joe Freebish for years.
Well, let me up and I'll explain.
All right, get on your feet.
Now get your hands up.
Get over there.
Who are you really?
I've been telling you-- I'm Joe Freebish, Agent 63.
Sounds like Joe's voice, Max.
Yes.
And it's Joe's build, but it's not Joe's face.
Well, didn't you hear about the train wreck I was in last week?
Oh, yes, you almost got killed.
I was very self-conscious about those scars.
Now look.
Now go ahead, 99.
You too.
- Now feel these cheeks.
- Well, I-- No, please, be my guest.
Huh, huh?
Now pull on my nose.
It's perfect, isn't it, huh?
- Very nice.
- Tell the truth, 86.
Is this a great face, or isn't it?
It's okay, but I'm still not convinced you're the real Joe Freebish.
I've been telling you I am Joe!
Maybe he is Joe, Max.
Well, there's only one sure way to find out.
What happened in Cairo on the night of April 3rd, 1963?
Only the real Joe Freebish would know the answer to that.
All right.
- So that's what happened?
- Uh-huh.
I still get letters from the tall one.
- And then this is all plastic surgery?
- Right.
I don't understand.
Plastic surgery takes weeks to heal.
Not when Dr. Noodleman does it.
Isn't he the one who does plastic surgery for CONTROL agents without charging anything?
That's the one.
He's a great humanitarian.
Tell me, Joe, where is this doctor located?
His office is in town in the Conway building.
Why?
I've gotta clear something up.
And maybe I can bring an end to this business of going around jumping on people.
Where are you going, Max?
To ask Dr. Noodleman a few questions.
It must be very gratifying, Dr. Noodleman, to give people new hope, new life.
He who is blessed with a gift and does not share it lives in darkness.
I must remember that.
I'm getting a little tired of "A coward dies a thousand deaths".
Say, that one is fantastic, Doctor.
What did he look like before the operation?
Noodleman: He had a little button nose.
But I hate little button noses.
Doctor, I came here to ask you for some information.
It's always a pleasure to serve CONTROL.
Doctor, I have a theory that while facial characteristics can be altered, flares and twitches are a different matter.
Is this true?
Very true, Mr. Smart.
You see, Doctor, I've arrested certain criminals lately, criminals that I thought I recognized.
Then later you discovered you were mistaken.
Yes, unless-- Unless, those certain criminals have had certain plastic surgery performed, hmm?
Exactly!
Now, Doctor, I understand that you can perform plastic surgery - that heals almost immediately.
- That is correct.
You see, Doctor, I have reason to believe that KAOS has somehow gotten ahold of this technique.
That's why I came to you.
I was hoping perhaps you could give me a list of crooked doctors.
Did you look in the Yellow Pages?
Uh, no, I thought perhaps you could narrow it down faster.
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Possibly nothing.
Would you mind stepping into my examining room for a moment?
Sit right down, Mr. Smart.
Well, what is it, Doctor?
Probably nothing.
But as long as you're here, we might as well take a look.
Make yourself comfortable.
I'll be right back.
Maxwell Smart is in my office.
Is there still a $500,000 reward for his death?
Good.
No no, don't send anybody.
I'll kill him myself.
Now, Mr. Smart let's have a look.
What is it, Doctor?
This little scar on your cheek, how long have you had that?
Since I cut myself shaving this morning.
Well, as long as we've got you here, may as well patch it up.
- How does it feel?
- It's a little tight, Doctor.
Good.
Uh, I know this is a silly question, Doctor, but why am I being strapped in?
Well, so you won't move.
We wouldn't want you to move and, uh risk spoiling your classic features now, would we?
Doctor, when I learned what you had done for Joe Freebish something in my brain snapped.
What was that, Mr. Smart?
Well, I realized that some other doctor was performing the same operation for the KAOS syndicate.
Impossible.
I'm the only one who knows the technique.
Doctor, I'm gonna ask you a question and I want you to tell me the truth.
Are you going to kill me?
Yes.
Wouldn't you like a little more time to think over your answer?
This will only put you to sleep, Mr. Smart.
You won't feel a thing.
And when I wake up I'll be dead.
Exactly.
Don't move, Noodleman, or you're a dead doctor.
My hand-- you ruined it!
I'll never operate again.
All right, Larrabee, get him out of here.
Freebish and 99 telephoned me after you left your apartment and told me where you were going.
So I decided to come over here just in case you got into any trouble.
Nothing I couldn't handle, Chief.
Good work, Max.
I'm glad this case is closed.
What do you mean this case is closed?
- This case isn't closed.
- Why not?
Because it's shocking, absolutely shocking that a quack like that could be a CONTROL doctor for 10 years!
I want a complete and thorough investigation of this entire matter.
Who's in charge of our Medical Security Division?
- Max, the case is closed!
- Who is it, Chief?
You!
That's what I said, Chief.
The case is closed.
are absolutely fantastic.
He must have changed the faces of over 100 KAOS agents, Max.
Yes, but at least we have pictures of what they look like now.
We should be able to round most of them up.
Good news, Max.
We've received additional information on the $500,000 reward offered for your death.
What about it, Chief?
It runs out at midnight tonight.
You mean in four hours I'll stop being a marked man?
Absolutely.
You won't have to worry any longer about who your friends are or who your enemies are.
Oh, come on now, Chief, I never really thought-- That's all right, Max.
I understand.
Believe me, in your place I would have felt exactly the same way.
I wouldn't have known who to trust.
In that case, I wonder if you and 99 would mind doing me a favor until the deadline runs out.
- Certainly, Max.
- What is it?
Stick 'em up!
I mean, there's no use taking any chances now, is there?
Hey, up, up!
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Perkins, I think it was a big mistake for Accounting to send you down here.
I'm only checking out our agents in accordance with CONTROL's new directive on economy.
Well, stay out of my way.
In just a few minutes Eric Kruger-- one of KAOS's top agents-- will be coming out of that theater door.
Why don't you go in after him?
I've seen the picture.
Good.
By waiting for him outside the theater you saved CONTROL $1.80.
Stand back.
Here he comes now.
All right, Kruger, hold it.
I'll have to report you, Smart.
Report me?
What are you talking about, Perkins?
- That's Kruger, isn't it?
- That may be Kruger, but you used three bullets when you could've used one.
Now, wait a minute, Perkins.
I know there's a cutback in appropriations, but this is ridiculous.
The directive states: "All agents will economize on bullets, exploding capsules and suicide pills".
Suicide pills?
Are you kidding?
I've saved CONTROL a fortune on suicide pills.
Why, in all the years I've been with them, I've only taken six or seven.
And that was only to please the Chief.
- Smart, that makes four.
- But, Perkins-- I don't know how we're going to explain four bullets in Kruger.
Maybe we could say that three of them were self-inflicted.
You've been hit.
I'd better get you an ambulance.
Oh no, I-- I'll take a crosstown bus.
A crosstown bus?
But you need a doctor.
Oh no.
CONTROL's budget could never stand it.
I'll just wash out the wound myself and put on a little iodine.
Well, I'd better call the Chief and tell him we've got our man.
- Operator: What number are you calling?
- 555-9417.
I'm sorry, that number has been disconnected.
- Disconnected?
- For failure to pay their bill.
Come on, we'd better get down to headquarters and find out about this.
My car is parked right outside in the street.
- Is that little red car yours?
- Yes, it is.
I'm from a finance company.
We're repossessing it.
- Repossessing it?
- CONTROL missed two payments.
Sorry, but I have to take it back.
That makes five.
- Who's that?
- Kruger.
Can I have the car keys, please?
Oh, one thing: be careful of the machine gun in the exhaust pipe.
It's been backfiring lately.
Machine gun in the exhaust pipe, right.
Oh, another thing: don't remove the radiator cap.
It sprays a poisonous gas.
Poisonous gas from radiator, right.
Oh, one last thing: don't use the cigarette lighter.
It's a hand grenade.
Lighter is a hand grenade.
Right.
You've got a dangerous car there.
I don't know why you say that.
It's got seat belts.
Well, Perkins, looks like we're gonna have to take the bus.
Say, have you got 25¢?
Forgot to tell him about the gas pedal.
We had to let the lab men go.
Chief, do you know they've disconnected my shoe phone?
Yes, I know, Max.
And I'm afraid I'll have to take your gun.
Holster?
Well, at least I still have my tear-gas pen.
Chief, I don't have anything.
Can't you at least give me a set of brass knuckles?
Brass is too expensive, Max.
I can let you have a new aluminum job.
Aluminum knuckles?
Not knuckles, Max, knuckle.
One will have to do.
Oh, and I'll take that suicide pill.
It's very expensive.
Well, Chief, what are they gonna use in place of the suicide pill?
If it's really necessary, I'd suggest a rope and a chair.
But that's ridiculous, Chief.
You know that KAOS always searches - its captives for rope and twine.
- Oh, that's right.
Of course if worse comes to worst, I can beat myself to death with a chair.
This cutback is ridiculous.
Max, we're due in 15 minutes to plead our case before a closed session of the Senate subcommittee.
Chief, you really think we can convince them to give CONTROL back its appropriation?
I hope so, Max.
But until then, we'll all have to tighten our belts.
Listen, Chief, this may be the wrong time, but I've been meaning to ask you - about that raise you promised me.
- Raise?
What raise?
This is no time to talk about a raise.
Max, be careful.
This fellow Dietrich-- the committee counsel-- he's a tough egg.
Don't worry, Chief.
I know what I'm doing.
Gentlemen, our first witness is an agent of CONTROL, Maxwell Smart.
Mr. Smart.
Come on, Max.
- Mr. Smart!
- What is it?
Will you please take your seat?
Just checking for hidden microphones.
I can assure you there are none.
Now if you'll just speak into that microphone-- Of course.
Gentlemen, I hope you'll forgive me if I seem a little overcautious, but I'm sure you'll understand.
You never know when a Senate investigating committee might be investigated by a Senate investigating committee.
Is this thing on?
But seriously, folks, I feel it only fair to say a word in the defense of CONTROL.
Gentlemen, CONTROL needs money to operate.
And let me tell you this, if we aren't operating, this country is in a lot of trouble.
Mr. Smart, if you're quite finished, would you mind taking your seat?
Certainly.
Gentlemen, I submit that CONTROL is a secret police force, answerable only to itself.
I submit that it is extravagant in its budget, ineffectual in its conduct, and worthless to the national interest.
- He's onto us, Chief.
- Dietrich: Mr. Smart, how many - arrests did CONTROL make last year?
- I don't know.
Who's the number-one man in your organization?
I don't know.
How many cases were assigned to CONTROL last year?
I don't know.
What would you do if you were fired, Mr. Smart?
They can't fire me.
And why not?
I know too much.
-  - This is Siegfried.
Get me a messenger.
I will have him take a message to Maxwell Smart at CONTROL's top-secret headquarters, And hurry.
They may not be in business too much longer.
Well, Chief, I'm afraid I didn't do too good at that hearing.
Don't blame yourself, Max.
That Dietrich is deadly.
Oh, here.
This letter is for you.
It looks important.
Chief, do you know who this letter is from?
- Who?
- It's from Siegfried, KAOS's top agent.
He wants me to meet him at Roger's Park to discuss possible employment.
They must know that CONTROL is in financial trouble and is laying off agents.
Don't worry, Chief.
I'd never join KAOS.
Wait a minute, Max.
If you could infiltrate KAOS and uncover the KAOS man who is high in our government, that will prove to the committee how valuable our work is.
Yes, I suppose it would.
Let me see that letter a minute.
Siegfried says he'll be disguised as an old woman.
I want you to meet him disguised as an old man.
Why, Chief?
To show KAOS that we're just as clever as they are.
Well, okay, if you say so, Chief.
It's just that I hate to have people think that I'm leaving CONTROL.
It looks like I'm deserting a sinking ship.
We're not sinking, Max.
CONTROL is still in business.
We're very much a going concern.
I'll call Senator Palmer and arrange another meeting.
Larrabee?
Yes, sir.
I want an appointment with Senator Palmer.
Call him.
On what?
They took my phone away too.
Don't just stand there.
Call him from the candy store on the corner.
Yes, sir.
Chief-- you got a dime on you?
Max.
Siegfried, is that Smart over there?
Ja, it must be.
I'll contact him.
You return to headquarters, Hans.
- Ja.
- Ja, what?
- Ja, sir.
- That's better.
Good luck with the defector.
I'll see you back at KAOS.
All right, Siegfried, what's the deal?
Smart, KAOS is a growing organization.
Und you'll be working with a great bunch of boys.
I don't know, Siegfried.
I've heard they're not all as rotten as they pretend to be.
Not as rotten?
Are you kidding?
They're all former quiz masters, disc jockeys, used car salesmen, TV repairmen und politicians.
Now look, Siegfried, all I want you to do is to give me one good reason why I should join KAOS.
Smart, in this world there are the poor good guys and the rich bad guys.
Which would you like to be?
Glad to have you aboard.
You begin training school tomorrow.
Training school?
I don't need any training school.
Ja, Smart, you must learn.
We do things differently at KAOS.
We have a unique clause: either you graduate or you are shot.
You must have some interesting graduations.
You don't know whether to come with a cap and gown or a blindfold.
Now that our business is settled, what do you say we have a schnapps together?
Are you kidding, Siegfried?
I'm not taking you into a public bar dressed like that.
What's the matter with the way I'm dressed?
This is one of my best disguises.
Well, if you must know, you look absolutely silly and ridiculous.
I could go home and change into a miniskirt.
Never mind, Siegfried, I'll take you for one drink.
One drink and that's all.
What do you mean by that?
One drink.
No dinner.
No dancing.
Siegfried, are you absolutely sure this blindfold is necessary?
I'm afraid so, Smart.
No one but me knows the location of KAOS headquarters.
- No one?
- No one.
Drive, Boris.
You will start your training program in this class, Smart.
-  - Excuse me.
Hello?
Ja, Smart is here now.
I believe him to be a legitimate defector.
Of course, sir.
If he proves to be a double agent--  Yes, sir.
I used to have one of those.
This is our class in advanced torture.
It is here we teach our men how to withstand pain.
We've done exhaustive research on the study of pain.
Do it again.
Quiet, stupid!
We're not here for laughs.
Lutz.
It also has practical advantages.
Hans is 6'4" tall.
When he first joined KAOS, he was only 5'9".
Hans I would like you to meet Maxwell Smart, formerly the top agent at CONTROL.
Americans make such inferior spies.
- No strength.
- Ah, you are unfair, Hans.
Smart was a giant in his former service.
Tell us, Smart, what does CONTROL teach you to do if a man comes at you with a knife and tries to stab you?
That depends on whether he's a friend or an enemy.
Let us show you the KAOS way.
That is how KAOS teaches its men to handle an attacker.
If you don't mind, Siegfried, I'd like to try that again.
One more time.
Okay, that's enough.
I think I've proved my point.
- What's that?
- That dummy fell for the same trick three times.
I fear that Hans is a little too much for you.
Why don't you try hitting him in the stomach?
Good idea.
Hans?
For you.
Jawohl.
What are you doing here?
- You should study for tomorrow's exam.
- Oh yes, of course.
Well, you see, Siegfried, I thought it would be a lot easier to study for tomorrow's exam if I had a copy of it tonight.
Excellent.
All the world loves a cheat.
Forget the exam.
You just passed it.
Oh, well, that's great.
It certainly calls for a drink.
- Do you have any beer?
- Do I?
!
Some fine lager from Bavaria.
You know, Siggie, you and I have had - some great times together.
- Ja.
Do you remember the time you tried to smuggle that Japanese scientist out of America?
- But we didn't let you.
- Oh, yes.
What ever happened to him?
I still have him.
I didn't have the heart to kill him.
Und besides, he does such a wonderful job on my garden.
You know, Smart, I have always liked you, even when I was trying to kill you.
Do you remember the time you swallowed the formula for the new missile-carrying submarine?
Oh yes, and you gave orders to that KAOS doctor - to cut my stomach out.
- Und you kept asking me if KAOS was covered by Blue Cross.
Yes, and the Chief rescued me just in time, just before that doctor made his incision.
The joke was on you, Smart.
That man wasn't a doctor.
Really?
But he held the knife right over my stomach.
He was guessing.
You know, Smart, as a KAOS super spy, I act very sure of myself, so tough, but deep down I am filled with doubts.
All the spying und killing in the war between us-- - mm-hmm.
- You wonder if it's all necessary?
No.
I wonder why we are not winning.
- Man: Siegfried?
- Ja.
Maxwell Smart is not a true defector.
You know what to do.
Liquidate him.
- I think for Mr. Smart the jig is up.
-  Oh, hello, Hans.
Would you like a little beer?
It's from Bavaria.
What were you doing on Herr Siegfried's phone?
Und what have you done to Herr Siegfried?
It was a wrong number and Mr. Siegfried is asleep.
- Too much party.
- I must awaken him.
Using this phone is forbidden.
This act must be reported.
Good thinking, Hans.
I'm not your usual KAOS killer, you know?
I think about things.
I'll bet you do.
Say, Hans I wonder if you'd mind if I tried punching you in the stomach again.
If you like.
But this time you won't catch me by surprise.
Okay.
Stomach ready?
All right.
Go ahead.
Gentlemen, you will be distressed to learn that the subcommittee will recommend that the appropriation for CONTROL be denied.
Your agency's had quite a run for its money, but now the jig is up.
What did you say, Dietrich?
I said the jig is up.
It's a figure of speech.
Indeed it is, Mr. Dietrich.
And that figure of speech was all I needed to expose you as a foreign spy in the employ of KAOS.
- Max, what are you saying?
- How about it, Dietrich?
Oh, it's ridiculous.
Smart is taking a last, desperate gamble to make the committee think that CONTROL serves a useful purpose.
Why, he wasn't even able to learn anything posing as a defector to KAOS.
Dietrich, how did you know that I was a defector to KAOS?
Only the Chief and I and KAOS knew that.
Anyone of you comes near me, the senator dies.
Max: It won't work, Dietrich.
Senator Harper is not up for reelection.
Cool it, Max.
We can't risk the senator's life.
You haven't got a chance, Dietrich.
- Oh no?
- You wouldn't dare.
It's 14 stories.
Not me.
All of you.
Oh, that's different.
In that case you've got a chance.
Except for one thing: one shot from that pistol and the cops will come rolling in here like oranges.
Your point, Smart.
But the game is mine.
- That door is locked, Dietrich.
- Wrong, Smart.
Ah-hhh.
Wasn't the elevator working?
Yes, but it was on the ground floor.
Gentlemen, it may interest you to know that Mr. Dietrich with one jump has just broken the indoor free-fall record.
Max, what was your first clue that Dietrich was a KAOS agent?
It was an expression he used, Chief.
- But why'd he pull a gun?
- Perhaps he knew the jig was up.
Exactly what I was thinking.
You see, Chief, when I got that phone-- I think I may have just made a terrible mistake.
Ah, Smart.
Nice to see you.
Siegfried, what in the world are you doing here?
- Have an ice cream?
- Oh, thank you.
So, Smart, this round goes to you.
I should've known you'd never defect to KAOS.
I certainly hope I didn't make you look too bad in the eyes of your superiors.
Well, it was a little embarrassing since I did recommend you and since you did expose our top man in government, but KAOS is made up of reasonable men.
They believe in forgive and forget.
Good.
Say, this certainly is a wonderful cover you've got here.
What cover?
This is how I make my living.
Raspberry ripple!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
This is the prince's suite, Max.
Boy, he must be driving the house detective crazy.
Max, they're his wives.
Sure, Chief.
Prince Abu Ben Bubi, this is Agent 86.
Be seated.
I'm assigning him to security duty here at the suite.
to protect the lives of the prince and his wives.
- 86!
- Huh?
Oh, yes, Chief, right.
Uh, tell me, Your Highness, how many wives do you have?
going on 34.
Just met a nice girl recently.
- We're going steady.
- How do you support them?
Max, Prince Bubi is a very wealthy man.
His country produces more oil than any nation in the world.
Well, it had better.
After all, he's got a 33-car family.
Max, there are certain factions in the prince's government that would like to break his oil contract with the United States and turn it over to iron curtain countries instead.
That will never happen.
Not while I'm alive!
Well, if you will excuse me, gentlemen, I must prepare for lunch.
Max, I hope you realize how important it is to keep the prince alive.
I certainly do, Chief, and the first thing we have to do - is to get him away from his wives.
- Why?
Well, with all that fanning he could catch pneumonia!
Max, there are only 18 hours left before the prince returns home.
I'm placing this suite on blue alert-- extreme emergency conditions!
I don't think you have to worry, Chief.
After all, there were two attempts on the prince's life and both of them failed.
Max, KAOS must succeed in killing the prince while he's visiting our country.
Then they'll be able to turn his people against us so they'll sanction the breaking of the oil contract.
Now if the United States ever loses that oil-- Don't worry, Chief.
If that happens, - we can always depend on Herbie.
- Who's Herbie?
Herbie is a friend of mine who owns a gas station.
He's got a lot of oil.
See if Agent 13 is at his post.
I'll call headquarters.
Right, Chief.
No, I'm out on my pony playing polo.
Of course I'm here.
Look, I know you've got a lonely job, 13, but there's no need to be so sarcastic about it.
Well, it does have its compensations-- the other side of this chimney opens at the Harem girls' suite.
Listen, 13, if you're feeling a little cooped up - and you would like to be released -  - Chief: Cover me, Max.
- Right, Chief.
I'll see you later.
It's all right, Max.
It's room service.
Just put it on the table over there, please.
That's the prince's lunch, Max.
I think you'd better taste it.
No, thanks, Chief.
I've already had lunch.
All food should be checked out before the prince eats them.
There's always a possibility of poisoning.
Now taste it.
Hmm, smells delicious.
What is it?
Camel's ears boiled in goat's milk.
- Now taste the coffee.
- Hmm?
-  - Taste the coffee.
No, thanks, Chief.
I don't drink coffee.
It keeps me awake.
Taste it, Max!
That's an order.
Wait a minute, Chief.
What if this coffee is poisoned?
Then it won't keep you awake.
- Well?
-  - What's the matter?
- Needs a little sugar.
Max, I have to go to my post.
Now remember, I'll be sitting in my car parked downstairs right outside that window.
- If anything happens, signal me.
- Right, Chief.
Here.
Your tip is on there.
Prince, your lunch is ready.
Right this way, Your Highness.
Well, you'll see what we have for you today.
-  - There you are, Bubi.
Ahhh what is it?
Ears of a camel boiled in goat's milk.
Terrific.
Certainly is a noisy candle.
Yes, sounds more like a fuse than-- - What is it?
- Dynamite.
Hold it.
Sorry about that, Chief.
Well, that's a good thing that you weren't in the car when the dynamite hit, Chief.
I would have been if I hadn't stopped on my way out to get a pack of cigarettes.
So cigarettes saved my life.
And they say smoking is bad for you.
Max, we've learned that one of the prince's wives - is a KAOS agent.
- Which one?
We don't know.
It could be the tall exotic one, it could be the short voluptuous one, it could be-- I'll check them all out immediately, Chief.
Max, he has 33 wives.
So it will take a little time.
-  - Yes?
- Man: She's here, Chief.
- Send her in.
That looks wonderful.
Turn around.
- Excellent.
What do you think, Max?
- Well, it's very nice, - but will your wife wear it?
- Oh, Max, it's not for his wife, it's for me.
ashamed of yourself walking around in public like that.
Max, it's a disguise.
That's 99's job.
I'm assigning her to pose as one of the Harem girls to find which one is a KAOS agent.
You can go, 99, but remember-- as soon as you're sure which one of the wives is a KAOS agent, do nothing but watch her closely.
She's probably only an inside contact.
Right, Chief.
Then when she contacts the assassin, we'll be ready for him - when he strikes.
- Exactly.
I better be going, Chief.
Anything else?
- No.
- Max: Yes!
One more thing, 99-- as soon as you get in that Harem Suite, I want you to take the blanket off the bed immediately!
- What do I do with it, Max?
- Hang it over the fireplace.
- Max!
Go on, 99, and good luck.
- Thanks, Chief.
Now, Max, the Pentagon has just informed us that we are to have international help on this case.
- Oh, really?
From what country?
- Israel.
Israel?
!
Israel is going to save the life of an Arab prince?
Israel has excellent relations with prince Abu Ben Bubi's nation.
It's vital to the Israeli government that no harm comes to the prince.
What kind of help are they gonna give us?
Well, they have an espionage unit comparable to our own CONTROL organization.
- It's one of the finest in the world.
- What's it called?
"Your Espionage Network and Training Academy".
It's referred to by its initials, Y-E-N-T-A.
- YENTA.
- YENTA?
They know everything that's going on everywhere.
They're a small organization, but they've assigned their top man to the case.
- Who is he?
- Hmm?
- The man from YENTA?
- Agent 498.
-  - That's the international hotline.
- That may be YENTA calling.
-  CONTROL speaking.
Yes, go ahead, YENTA.
Mm-hmm.
I was afraid of that.
Right, I'll have Agent 86 meet him at the airport.
That's quite all right.
I understand.
Goodbye.
What's the matter, Chief?
Bad news?
- Le Moco.
- Le Moco?
He's KAOS's top assassin.
He's been given the assignment of killing the prince.
I'll be ready for him, Chief.
Max, Le Moco is no ordinary assassin.
He's fiendishly unpredictable and a master of disguise and voice impersonation.
In 27 assignments he has never failed yet.
That's quite a record.
His parents must be very proud of him.
He doesn't have any parents, Max.
They were his first assignment.
Le Moco was seen at the airport in Algiers where he booked passage on a plane to Washington.
Was 498 on the same plane with him?
No, Le Moco would've recognized him.
from Tel Aviv.
He'll arrive in Washington You'll meet 498 at the airport and he'll point out Le Moco when his plane lands.
- You'll take Le Moco into custody.
- Right, Chief.
Now, you'll use the fountain pen signal to identify yourself.
Pretend your pen isn't working, and 498 will identify himself - by offering you his pen.
- Got you, Chief.
Uh, Chief, what time does 498's plane arrive?
In exactly 15 minutes.
Why did YENTA wait so long to call?
They work on a limited budget, Max.
They have to wait until after 6:00 for the long distance rates to change.
Lucky they didn't drop us a postcard.
Here, try mine.
That's a beautiful pen you have there.
- 498?
- No, $1.19.
I buy them by the gross and give them away for bar mitzvahs.
- Agent 498?
- Who else?
- Maxwell Smart?
- Yes.
- When is Le Moco due?
- Wait a minute, aren't you gonna ask, "How was your flight"?
All right.
How was your flight?
Don't ask.
Man over P.A.: Attention, please.
Algerian Airlines flight 5 from Algiers now arriving gate 1.
- That's Le Moco's flight.
- Wait a minute.
Here's what we do-- we go over to customs and check out every passenger that comes through.
You'll point out Le Moco.
I'll get him, you cover me.
What are you gonna do?
I'll use my "shh".
- What's a "shh"?
- It's what you call a silencer.
- Well, that's the last of them.
- It checks out-- there were 65 people aboard, he's the 65th one - through customs.
- Wonderful.
So where is Le Moco?
He must have slipped through without our noticing him.
Am I gonna get it for this!
Le Moco loose in the city-- the prince is a sitting duck!
Come on, my car is right outside.
We'd better get back to headquarters immediately.
I'll be right with you.
I have to call Tel Aviv.
- Tel Aviv?
Now?
- I promised my mother I'd call her the minute I arrived.
She worries.
This is Le Moco.
I have arrived undetected.
Max, you oughta be ashamed of yourself!
Why, 99?
I'm just doing my job.
You don't have to do it so well.
Can I help it if I love my work?
- Besides, it's part of my plan.
- What plan?
Well, I don't have it all worked out yet.
But I'm trying to find out which one of the wives is the KAOS agent.
How are you going to accomplish that by kissing them?
Well, that's the part I haven't worked out yet.
Listen, I already have an idea of which one is the KAOS agent.
I'm just waiting for her to make her move.
Well, you better get back inside and keep your eye on her.
As Your Highness wishes.
Would Your Highness like his water pipe filled?
Forget it, I've already smoked three gallons today.
Max, you've got to be careful.
Le Moco is going to be here any minute and he's going to mistake you - for the prince.
- That's exactly our plan, 99.
While Agent 498 is back at my apartment guarding Abu Ben Bubi, I'll be here waiting for Le Moco and catch him red-handed trying to assassinate the prince.
Max, you're so brave.
You're going to get a medal for this.
There's something more important than medals, 99.
- What?
- It's after 6:00.
I get overtime.
Say, 13, that's a great disguise.
What disguise?
I'm on fire.
Listen, 13, will you please stop with your petty complaints?
This is an important case!
- Now, have you got anything to report?
- Yeah, yeah.
Just when I pinpointed which Harem girl was the KAOS agent, she lit a fire in the fireplace, and 99 hung a blanket over it.
- What did she look like?
- Well, she was about the same height as 99, same hair, same figure as 99.
- There was one slight difference.
- What was that?
She had a match in her hand.
- Thanks a lot, 13.
-   - Who is it?
- Male voice: It's the maid.
Hello, operator?
This is Maxwell Smart, Secret Agent 86.
Get me CONTROL headquarters immediately.
- Chief: Hello?
- Hello, Chief?
This is Max.
- What is it, Max?
- Listen, Chief, I'm gonna need some help.
Three assassins just tried to kill me.
- What happened?
- I've got all three of them, Chief.
Oh, good.
If there's any more trouble, I've assigned agents 24, Good.
Where are they?
and 26 is disguised as a maid.
Do you think you know how to contact them?
Well, I'm not sure, Chief, but I think a medium might help.
Max, you didn't!
You couldn't, you wouldn't!
Don't get excited, Chief.
I think the maid has a 50-50 chance to pull through.
Hold it, Chief.
- Did you send anybody else?
- I hope not.
Boy, am I glad I wore this instead of my sweater.
worked perfectly!
Le Moco just left here thinking he killed the prince, but the prince is still safely stashed away in my apartment.
Has that girl made a move yet?
Good.
Now we've still got to capture Le Moco.
He should be contacting her any minute.
You better get back inside and keep an eye on her.
Psst, Max.
- What is it now, 99?
- What did she say?
- What did who say?
- The girl you were just talking to?
She didn't say anything.
I did all the talking.
Oh!
Oh, 99, don't tell me that wasn't you.
Me, Max?
I've been watching that girl.
Then I saw her come out and talk to you.
- What's wrong?
- What's wrong?
What's wrong?
!
Nothing is wrong, except that I told her the whole plan-- the whole plan to the wrong girl!
I thought it was you!
Oh, Max, what are we gonna do now?
She's probably contacting Le Moco right this minute.
That means that Le Moco will know that the prince is still alive and in my apartment.
I gotta get over there right away.
- You get back inside and hold her.
- Right, Max.
I actually don't think I could tell us apart myself.
Should Le Moco learn of our plan and come here, he'd never expect to find two princes.
I am most fortunate to have a man as capable as you to guard me.
Le Moco is a vicious killer!
He might try to shoot me, to stab me, to poison me.
But the important thing is you should live and be well.
-  - I'll see who it is.
- Who's there?
- It's me, Maxwell Smart.
- What are you doing here, Maxie?
- Le Moco is wise to us.
I'm to take the prince away from here immediately.
Let's go.
Prince?
But first we must call your CONTROL headquarters and let them know that you got here before Le Moco did.
Don't touch that phone.
So you are not Maxwell Smart.
Tsk, there's only one man who could master a voice so perfectly-- Le Moco.
At your service.
Well, Le Moco, the joke's on you.
You don't know which of us is the prince and which isn't.
That's true.
So I will have to kill you both.
Well, we never figured on that one, did we, Prince?
Adieu, gentlemen.
Prince!
Your Highness!
Hello, Bubi.
Wait a minute, there's something definitely wrong here.
One of those two men is Le Moco!
Quick, give me the gun!
Don't do it.
He's Le Moco.
- Who are you?
- I'm Prince Abu Ben Bubi.
How do I know you're not Le Moco?
You can believe him, Smart.
- And who are you?
- I'm Agent 498.
Oh, no, you're not.
I just left agent 498 a few hours ago and he hadn't even started to grow a beard.
Well, we know you're Maxwell Smart.
Don't confuse me.
How do you know that I'm not Maxwell Smart?
Hey, that's very good.
What other impressions do you do?
Hold it right there!
Get up.
Drop the gun.
Wait a minute, what is this?
Max, which one is you?
- Right here, Chief.
- Right here, Chief.
- Right here, Chief.
- No, he's Le Moco.
I'm Max.
Don't fall for that, Chief.
I'm Max.
- I'm the prince.
- I'm hungry.
Quiet, all of you.
One of you is Le Moco-- which one is it?
- Not me.
- Not me.
- Not me.
- Not me.
All right, which one is the prince?
- I am the prince.
- I am the prince.
- No, he's the prince.
- No, he's the prince.
Hold it!
Now, what was your question again?
Max, come here.
- Now, which one is the prince?
- Eh I'm not sure, Chief, but there's one way to find out.
- How?
- Number one, what's your name?
My name is Prince Abu Ben Bubi.
Max: Number two, what's your name?
My name is Prince Abu Ben Bubi.
- Number three-- - Hmm, hmm - How many wives do you have?
- Max, stop it!
There's only one way to find out who is really the prince.
Right, Chief.
Will the real Prince Abu Ben Bubi - step forward?
- No, Max, the real prince is the one with the real beard!
I'll start with number one.
Max!
Max, where are you?
Right here, Chief.
That's Le Moco on the ground.
Tear off his beard.
That's Le Moco, all right.
Good shooting, Max.
You got him.
- Get him a glass of water.
- He's dead, - it wouldn't help.
- It wouldn't hurt.
- Max, are you all right?
- That's not Max, 99.
- Oh!
Oh, Max.
-  - 99, that's not Max, either.
- Oh!
- Max!
-  - Oh, Max, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine, 99.
Max, you amaze me.
Le Moco's makeup and voice impersonations were perfect.
You had to get off that shot in a split second.
How did you know it was Le Moco and not really the prince?
Well, it was really quite simple, Chief.
You see, number one looked too much like the prince to really be the prince.
Number three didn't know how many wives he had.
So I picked number two.
Well, with all that rolling and scuffling around, How did you know that number two was number two?
- Huh?
- How did you know it was number two?
Oh, well, that was just a lucky guess.
Goodbye, 498.
I've enjoyed working with you.
Oh, likewise, I'm sure, 99.
And you, Smart-- I feel towards you like I feel towards my own brother-in-law.
- Brother.
- No, brother-in-law.
I don't talk to my brother.
- Goodbye, 498.
- Goodbye, Chief.
And if any of you ever get to my country, be sure and give me a call.
I'll be happy to show you around.
You can reach me at that number.
Oscar's Delicatessen.
Say, that's a great idea, using a delicatessen for a front.
What front?
That's the business we're in.
We only do spy work during our slack season.
Ooh, well, I'll miss my flight, gotta run.
Goodbye and good luck.
Well, that's one more case closed.
Sometimes I wonder what it's all for-- all the destruction, killing, murdering.
Well, as 498 would say, it's a living.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Camptown ladies sing this song.
- Doo-dah, doo-dah.
- Camptown race track five miles long.
- Oh-de-doo-dah-day.
- Is that you, 24?
- Yes, 86.
Are you sure you weren't followed?
Absolutely sure.
Are you ready for my report?
Go ahead.
All right, to begin with, after the most thorough investigation on my part, it is my considered belief that there is absolutely nothing suspicious about this museum.
What about the anonymous tip that the museum is somehow tied in with the mysterious disappearance of four CONTROL agents?
Negative.
- Are you sure, 86?
- I'm absolutely positive.
I'm willing to stake my reputation on that observation.
As a matter of fact, it's my considered opinion that this museum is one of the few safe places left in the world where CONTROL agents can meet.
Well, I guess that's it.
I'll see you back at headquarters, 24.
Oh, incidentally, that's a fantastic disguise.
But take my advice: do something about your voice.
It's a dead giveaway.
I don't understand it, Max.
If nothing suspicious is going on at that museum, why hasn't Agent 24 been heard from since your meeting two days ago?
I don't know, Chief.
Maybe he was picked up on the way back.
Picked up by whom?
Well, the way he was dressed, it could've been by a couple of sailors.
Max, what are you talking about?
Well, Chief, the last time that I saw Agent 24, he was wearing a dress, lipstick, high heels and a brunette wig.
Agent 24 wasn't working in disguise.
He wasn't?
Oh, well, in that case, when he gets back, he better have a long talk with the CONTROL psychiatrist.
Agent 24 is a good agent.
I don't know why you're knocking him.
Well, okay, Chief, if you feel that way about it, when he gets back, I'll take him dancing.
Here's something interesting.
It says here the mummy of the Egyptian King Tut IV is due to arrive in the United States today.
Oh, really?
When is his daddy due?
No, Max, his mummy.
King Tut IV is dead.
Oh, and you want me to find out who killed him.
Max, he died more than 3,000 years ago.
Oh, that's bad, Chief.
It's gonna be very difficult to round up witnesses.
Max, you're missing the point.
Now listen, it says here that King Tut's mummy is going to be placed on exhibit at the museum starting tomorrow.
Now, oddly enough, the mummy of another pharaoh arrived at the museum three days ago.
Was he dead too?
Of course!
They certainly do a lousy job of packing.
Max, that same day Agent 24 disappeared.
And the mummy of another pharaoh arrived at the museum And that was the day that Agent 47 disappeared.
Right.
Now do you see why I'm so suspicious?
No.
Max, I want you to go back to the museum and check everything out thoroughly.
And you'd better wear a disguise because they might recognize you from before.
Oh, and incidentally, Agent 13 is staked out there doing surveillance.
- If you need him, contact him.
- Right, Chief.
- Wait a minute, Chief, I just thought of something.
- What is it?
If there's another mummy arriving tomorrow, isn't there a good chance that I'll disappear too?
- I doubt it.
- Why?
Because I'm not that lucky, that's why.
What's the matter with you lately, Chief?
You go from a bad mood to a terrible mood just like that.
Get going, Max.
Right, Chief.
Camptown ladies sing this song, doo-dah, doo-dah Camptown racetrack five miles long  - Oh, it's you, 13.
- Of course it's me.
- Well, how are things going?
- Terrible!
What's the matter now?
How would you like somebody to water you six times a day?
Listen, 13, if you hate your job so much, why don't you get into some other line of business?
Because I'm a trained espionage agent.
And besides, it runs in the family.
Your father is a spy?
No, my mother.
- Really?
- Yeah.
She was very big in World War I. No kidding?
What's her name?
I don't know.
She won't tell us.
Listen, 13, have you seen 24 around?
No.
Well, have you noticed anything suspicious going on here?
Oh, yeah, keep your eye on Dr. Ramsey, the museum curator.
If ever I've seen a sinister character, it's him.
There's nothing I can put my finger on, it's-- oh, 86, will you do me a favor?
What?
You won't tell the Chief that my mother's a spy, will ya?
Well, okay, but why?
I don't think she's on our side.
Mr. Smart?
I beg your pardon?
Aren't you Maxwell Smart, the secret agent?
Why do you say that?
I mean what do you know about Maxwell Smart?
Well, I know that Maxwell Smart is handsome and fearless, and that he's a dedicated battler against evil and injustice.
And that he's the kind of man any girl would fall instantly in love with.
- Of course, if you're not him - Who says I'm not?
Oh, I'm so relieved that you're him, Mr. Smart.
Tell me this: Since my true identity is such a closely guarded secret, how were you able to recognize me?
I saw your picture in one of the secret agent fan magazines.
Oh, yes, of course.
That must have been the May issue of "Popular Espionage".
No, it was that picture of you in "True lmpossible Spy Stories Monthly".
They did a story on me?
Actually, it was an advertisement for a decoding device.
Oh, I forgot about that.
The little Handy-Dandy Pocket Decoder.
You looked wonderful in the ad.
I went right out and bought one.
My name is Lisa Smith.
I'm assistant curator here at the museum.
And-- I'm a little concerned about things that are going on here.
What sort of things?
That's just it.
So far, it's nothing I can put my finger on.
That's strange.
I just heard about another finger exactly like yours.
Tell me, Miss Smith, has the mummy of King Tut IV arrived yet?
No, but it's due any minute.
Well, I'll tell you what you do-- if you notice anything suspicious, here's my card.
Just call me.
I don't understand what these letters and numbers mean.
Oh, well, just use your Handy-Dandy Pocket Decoder.
Name, please.
KAOS Agent BR-29, Dr. Ramsey.
Correct.
Ticket, please.
Now when you're ready to return home, try to notify me at least especially during the holiday season.
All right, out you come.
KAOS International wants another CONTROL agent kidnapped and shipped out in my place immediately.
Mmm, I see.
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.
Now let me see, we want a CONTROL agent approximately 5'9" tall, who weighs in the neighborhood of 150 lbs.
Who is the next CONTROL agent to be a guest of KAOS European headquarters?
Which of our enemies will we have the pleasure of kidnapping and torturing for information?
Maxwell Smart.
So you made a contact at the museum for us.
That's very interesting.
Who is it, Max?
I can't give you that information right out here in the open, Chief!
It's highly confidential.
I demand the Cone of Silence.
Max, the Cone of Silence is not operating properly.
Can't you just whisper it to me?
Chief, five of our best agents have disappeared on this case already.
Then write it on a piece of paper and pass it to me.
Do you realize that an innocent girl's life may be in danger because of this information?
How about writing it in code in disappearing ink?
Absolutely not, Chief.
This information is too vital.
We'll have to use the coughing code.
Max, the coughing code has been dispensed with.
Too many agents were giving each other colds.
I don't care, Chief.
Either we use the coughing code, or we wait until the Cone of Silence is fixed.
All right, Max, the coughing code.
Let me have the information.
That's very interesting.
That's very strange.
Wait till you hear this, Chief.
Wow.
Just one question, Max.
-  - Aw, that's a tough one, Chief.
Would you mind rephrasing that cough?
Oh, well that I don't know.
But take my advice, Chief: see a doctor.
That's a nasty cough you've got there.
Max, do you swear that everything you've coughed is the absolute truth?
Absolutely, Chief.
Miss Lisa Smith is the assistant curator of the museum and she works for a Dr. Ramsey.
And she told me that she thought there were some strange things going on at that museum that she couldn't put her finger on, but the first time she saw anything suspicious, she would call me.
-  - What'd you say?
- God bless you.
-  Hello?
Oh, yes, just a moment please.
It's for you, Max.
Hello, Maxwell Smart here.
Mr. Smart, this is Lisa Smith at the museum.
Chief, it's her!
Yes, Miss Smith, what can I do for you?
You asked me to call if anything suspicious happened at the museum, Mr. Smart.
Well, something has, and I'm very worried.
Could we meet somewhere later today?
Well, yes, of course.
How about my apartment, about 6:00?
My address is on the card.
Thank you, Mr. Smart.
I'll be there.
What'd she say, Max?
She has some information for me, Chief.
Wants to meet me at my place tonight about 6:00.
I don't think I approve of that.
Don't worry, Chief.
I'll be a perfect gentleman.
Max, what do you know about this girl?
She might be leading you into some kind of trap.
Well, I suppose that's possible.
Here.
Before you discuss anything, slip one of these into her drink.
- What are they, Chief?
- Truth serum in pill form.
Once she's taken it, all you have to do is ask her if she's on the level.
She has to answer truthfully.
Well, all right, Chief.
If it'll make you feel any better, I'll put one of them in her drink.
But I'm telling you this, I know my women.
And this is one girl I'd trust with my very life.
Then after you distract Maxwell Smart, Miss Smith, slip this little knockout pill into his drink.
After he passes out, we'll do the rest.
What is the rest, Dr. Ramsey?
A little trip for Mr. Smart-- a trip that'll mean a victory for KAOS and death for Maxwell Smart.
-  -  - Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir, Monsieur Smart.
And a que será será to you.
Well I'm so glad you could make it, Miss Smith.
Won't you sit down?
Thank you.
I will.
Well, shall we have a little champagne before we talk?
- Please.
- I think you'll enjoy this.
Oh, I intend to enjoy it very much.
Would you like a little in your glass?
Yes, please.
This is a very special champagne.
- Notice the year.
- Oh, yes, Yes, it's an advance bottle.
I understand that that will be a very good year for wine.
- Cigarette?
- No, thank you.
Light?
You really have a charming apartment.
- Thank you.
-  Well Well Mr. Smart Miss Smith I was wondering if you would mind dimming the lights.
It's rather bright in here.
Good idea.
I was just going to suggest that myself.
Would you care for some music?
No, thank you.
I'd rather we just talk.
Ah, yes, the lost art of conversation.
Well, exactly what did you want to talk about, Miss Smith?
In a moment.
But first, to you.
Excellent champagne.
Are you kidding?
This is the cheapest champagne I could buy.
Now, Miss Smith, I want you to tell me the complete and absolute truth.
Miss Smith?
Sound asleep.
I wonder if it was something I said.
Hello?
Hello, Chief, this is Max.
- Well, you've done it again.
- I've done what again?
You and your truth pill.
The only thing it did was to put her to sleep.
Sleep, Max?
That's impossible.
Let's face it, Chief, the way you run CONTROL, nothing is impossible.
Max, you are talking to your superior!
Let's be honest, Chief, you may be my boss, but the only thing superior about you compared to me is your salary.
Max, what's come over you?
I don't know, Chief.
I apologize.
It's not your fault that you're not the smartest man in the world.
Max, could you have somehow taken that truth pill by mistake?
Could I have taken that truth pill by mistake?
You know something, Chief, I think you're right.
And it's giving me a terrible headache!
Max!
Max, are you there?
Max!
Weight: 149 lbs, height: 5' 91/2".
Strange, according our file, he should be exactly 5'9" tall.
You forgot the half inch for the bump on my head.
I'm sorry, Max.
If you weren't a CONTROL agent we could've had fun together.
What are you doing?
In case the box is opened by customs, Mr. Smart, we want them to find a mummy, not a captured CONTROL agent.
I hope you realize what this means, Doctor.
What's that?
You'll never get your license renewed in this state again.
He's wrapped for shipping, Doctor.
Good.
Put a "Handle with care" label on the mummy case, Miss Smith.
How about "Rhis end up"?
Oh, that's the shortwave, Miss Smith.
- Will you answer it?
- Of course, Doctor.
Now then, Mr. Smart, something no sophisticated traveler should be without.
What is it, a new way to serve martinis?
A relatively harmless serum which will render you completely rigid within the hour and keep you in that condition long enough for us to ship you to KAOS headquarters in Europe.
Ow!
Doctor, do you have a Band-Aid?
It's KAOS International calling.
Coming.
Max?
Max, where are you?
-  - Oh, excuse me.
- Max: Chief.
- Max?
Is that you?
Are you all right?
I'm lying here bandaged from head to foot and you ask me if I'm all right.
You'd make some lousy ambulance driver.
I'll unwrap you.
Hurry, Chief.
They gave me an injection, and I'm supposed to turn rigid any minute and stay that way an entire week.
Somebody's coming.
Dr. Ramsey, look.
Drop it.
Now the gun.
- Sorry about that, Max.
- Drop it!
It's all right, Max.
It's Agent 13.
We're safe.
Drop it!
Dr. Ramsey, I presume.
Correct.
And you must be the Chief of CONTROL.
- That's right.
- How unfortunate.
Now I'm afraid I shall have to kill you both.
You first, Mr. Smart.
You wouldn't hit a lady, would you?
Well, I-- no.
- Good.
-   Everybody stay right where you are.
Chief: All right, 13, get them out of here.
All right, you two, on your way.
Max, how do you feel?
Are you kidding, Chief?
I've got a terrible headache, every bone in my body is broken and I've got heartburn.
Max, I had no choice.
It's all right, Chief.
I understand.
There was nothing else I could do-- - It's all right, Chief.
Forget it.
- They had me covered - all the time, Max-- - Drop it, Chief!
I wish I hadn't said that.
Just stand him up over there.
That'll be $2.40.
$2.40?
The meter only read $1.90.
Yeah, well, we charge 50¢ extra for trunks and dummies.
Here, keep the change.
Well, Max, the case of the disappearing CONTROL agents is a closed book, thanks to you.
Thanks to us, Chief.
No, Max, thanks to you, remember?
I'm "not the smartest guy in the world" Oh, come on, now, Chief, you're still not annoyed over that crack I made while I was under the influence of the truth pill?
No, Max, of course not.
The question is what are we gonna do with you?
According to the CONTROL lab, there's no antidote.
So you'll be like that for the next week.
Well, why don't you put me on sick leave?
'Cause you're not sick, you're just stiff as a board.
Well, what do you suggest, Chief?
Max, why don't you take your vacation during the next week?
My vacation?
!
Are you kidding?
How much fun could I have in this kind of a condition?
Well, I'm sorry, Max.
Regulations are regulations.
Either you take your vacation next week, report here for work Monday morning, or you'll be docked a week's pay.
Now, wait a minute, Chief.
Let me get this straight-- if I don't leave this office, you have to pay me, right?
That's right.
Now shall I call you a cab and take you home?
Now just let's figure this out.
The cab takes me home now, that's $2.20, upstairs, then $2.20 to bring me back again here Monday.
If it's all the same with you, Chief, I think I'll just stay here.
I could act as night security guard.
Well, what are you gonna do if something happens?
You can't press the alarm button.
Well, I could fall down with a tremendous thud.
Well, I'll tell them to listen for you downstairs.
- Good night, Max.
- Wait a minute, Chief.
One more thing-- I hope I wasn't out of line with that crack about you not being the smartest guy in the world.
It's all right, Max.
Max: Of course, who am I to say?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Help me.
Help me.
I just never get tired of this business.
Ahh think I just hurt myself.
Wake up.
Wake up.
They're after me!
They tried to kidnap me!
Don't let them get me.
Please, you must help me.
There there, now.
You're perfectly safe here.
Now why don't you just sit back here and relax and tell me who you are?
I-- I'm Miss United States.
Miss United States?
That's an odd name for a girl.
Well, it's just my title.
My real name is Tisha.
I came in town for the beauty contest.
My daddy told me to come to you if I needed help.
Your daddy?
Who's that?
Herman Heinschmidt.
Of course, Herman Heinschmidt, the famous American scientist.
Well, that clears up a lot of questions.
Let's see, the Chief should still be in his office.
Look, you just sit back and take it easy.
I'm going to call the Chief.
Everything is going to be all right.
Hello, Chief, this is Max.
I've got a Code 16 on my hands.
Code 16?
Hang on Max, we'll get you out.
-  - All personnel, red alert.
Code 16.
Code 16.
Chief Williams, you take this.
Larrabee Johnson hang on, Max.
Chief, will you stop all that yelling so I can tell you about my Code 19?
you said 16.
the difference?
About $5,000.
All right, men.
-  - All personnel, all personnel.
Code 16 canceled.
All clear.
Repeat, all clear.
Max, I wish you'd study your manual.
Sorry about that, Chief, but I've never had a code 19 before.
As a matter of fact, I've never had a Code 16 before.
All right, Max, you've got a Code 19-- woman being pursued by an unknown assailant, right?
- Right.
- Who is she?
She's the daughter of Herman Heinschmidt, the famous American scientist.
Well, you better let her stay there tonight.
Right, Chief.
I'll call you in the morning.
Hold on a minute, Max.
You're spending the night at my apartment.
Well, Chief, is that advisable with a code 19?
That's an order, Max.
Herman Heinschmidt is a personal friend of mine.
I'm not going to let his daughter spend the night with an unmarried agent.
Chief, do you know how long it will take to get a married agent over here?
Max, I don't want any agent over there.
Give her a gun to protect herself and tell her not to open the door for anyone.
Right, Chief.
I'm going upstairs and change my clothes.
I'll be down in a few minutes.
If you need me, just call.
All right, Tisha, I have to go now, but here's what I want you to do-- I want you to take this gun, and if anybody comes to that door-- I don't care how innocent he looks-- I want you to shoot first and ask questions later.
- You understand?
- I understand.
- Mr. Smart - You can call me Max.
Max thank you.
You're welcome.
- One more thing-- -  Forget it.
Is that you, Mr. Smart?
Yes, it's me, Max.
Open up.
How did you find out about that?
- How did I find out about what?
- That secret panel.
That's my own personal and highly secretive invention.
How exciting.
Yes, I use it so I can get in when I forget my keys.
Tisha, what are you wearing?
Oh, I took the liberty of borrowing a pair of your pajamas.
- I hope you don't mind.
- No, that's all right.
- My, you are neat man, Mr. Smart.
- Uh, thank you, Tisha.
Shirts in one drawer and socks in another drawer, classified information in another drawer.
I couldn't get the top drawer open though.
I always keep that drawer locked.
Why?
What's in it?
Pajama bottoms.
Listen, Tisha.
You better get dressed.
We've got to go down to CONTROL headquarters and see the Chief.
He wants you to look at some pictures so maybe you can identify your would-be abductors.
Ooh.
I'll hurry.
Wait a minute, Tisha.
Did anybody try to get in here last night?
No, your landlord came to the door, but I wouldn't let him in.
Good girl.
What did he want?
He wanted to know if there was a girl in your apartment.
- I told him no.
- Good.
What did he say to that?
He said you better take something for your cold.
Yes, well, why don't you go get dressed, Tisha?
- I'll hurry.
- And don't put those pajama tops in with the classified information.
Mr. Smart, I'm in terrible danger, aren't I?
Yes, Tisha, but don't worry about it.
You're in good hands.
You'll be protected by a CONTROL agent who is highly intelligent, extremely perceptive and absolutely fearless.
- Oh.
- What's the matter?
Well, I was hoping it would be you.
Miss Heinschmidt, this is the Chief.
Chief, this is Miss Heinschmidt.
- Miss Heinschmidt.
- Hi.
Uh, Miss Heinschmidt, do you think you could identify the men who tried to kidnap you last night?
I'm afraid not.
It was dark.
I couldn't see.
Well, I can confirm that, Chief.
Last night was a very dark night.
Well, who'd want to kidnap little ol' me?
Your father is a very valuable scientist.
There are certain people who'd like to get hold of him.
Like who?
Tisha, there is an organization of shrewd, determined men who have been trying to get control of this country for a number of years.
Perhaps you have heard of them.
Oh, you mean the republicans.
No, we mean KAOS.
- KAOS?
- Max: Yes.
A monstrous organization of evil dedicated to the destruction of the free world and the systematic subjugation of every man, woman and child on this planet.
Oh, my daddy wouldn't work for them.
He hates to see children subjugated.
- Miss Heinschmidt-- - Would you call me "Miss USA"?
It sounds so much nicer than "Miss Heinschmidt".
Miss USA, it's obvious you are in great danger.
I must recommend that you withdraw from the contest.
Withdraw from the contest?
Well, I can't.
I simply can't.
But your life may be at stake.
It doesn't matter.
I love this contest and all that it stands for-- beauty, cooperation, friendliness, and $10,000 in prize money.
Chief, can I talk to you for a minute?
- Yes, Max.
- Excuse us.
Chief, she just gave me an idea.
Forget it, Max.
No, Chief, you don't understand.
It's obvious from what this girl tells us that KAOS has infiltrated this contest.
Now if we want to ferret them out we're going to need this girl's help.
It's dangerous, but she seems willing.
Yes, so what we have to do is assign a CONTROL agent to her, someone the girl can trust.
Max, I want you to stay by her side This is your case, Max.
All right, Chief, but there's one problem.
I'm going to be the only man there.
Those girls will all be trying to make a play for me.
Why, they'll be all over me like a swarm of locusts.
So what's the problem?
When am I going to find time to work on the case?
You know, Carlson, I always wanted to wear one of these opera hats.
It's neat the way they fold up.
- Smart!
- What is it, Carlson?
- That hat doesn't fold.
- Well, I can see that.
Oh, don't!
Say, Carlson, it's a good thing I got this umbrella.
Again.
Did you tell him about the camera?
I was just about to.
Give me the umbrella, Max.
Be careful, Chief.
It's not only an umbrella, - it's a rifle.
- I know, Max, and it also has a high-speed camera in the handle.
This is the lens and this is the shutter release.
Oh, I get it, Chief.
If a KAOS agent attacks me, I can take his picture.
Max, the purpose of this umbrella is to take pictures of the contestants.
Get the film back here.
We'll process them and put them through the computer.
Chief, do you think it's fair to judge the girls on looks alone?
Max, we are not judging the contest.
I have a suspicion that one of the entrants is a KAOS plant.
Now, the computer will make the identification.
You've got to take a picture of every girl in that contest.
- In bathing suits?
- Any way you want.
Okay, bathing suits.
Max, if my hunch proves correct, one of the photos will identify a beautiful KAOS agent.
Well, what will we do with the rest of the pictures, Chief?
What do you suggest?
Come, we go.
Did you ever see so many gorgeous females?
Tisha, to me this is just another job.
Let's go.
What happened?
You fell over the luggage.
Right.
Shh.
Don't make a sound.
We have to check out this entire suite and make sure it isn't bugged.
You take the bedroom.
I'll take the living room.
- Did you find anything?
- Nope, did you?
- No.
- Well, what do we do now?
Call the desk and have the maid make up the room.
Gosh, Mr. Smart, you're too nice to be a secret agent.
Well, there are good secret agents and there are bad secret agents.
There are?
Well, what's the difference?
Well, the good secret agents are on our side.
The bad secret agents are on their side.
Hello, this is room 613.
Would you send a maid up, please?
- Thank you.
- Golly, Mr. Smart you sure are taking good care of little ol' me.
I sure hope there won't be any trouble.
Well, I don't think there will be, Tisha.
Although there's something that's been bothering me.
Somehow I feel that I've seen that face somewhere before.
- What face?
- The face on that fat stupid chaperone.
- So I'm fat and stupid, eh?
- Quiet.
You could afford to lose a little weight, stupid.
You'll pay for this, Mr. Maxwell Smart.
Maxwell Smart?
- Yes.
- Are you certain?
Yes, I saw his picture in the post office at KAOS headquarters.
Oh, and I assume the presence of Mr. Maxwell Smart will change the nature of our mission.
Yes.
Before we get the girl, we must kill Smart.
But how?
We are under strict orders to do nothing that will attract attention to ourselves.
Yes.
Wait there is to be a cocktail party this afternoon in suite of Miss USA, no?
Yes.
What better way to commit a quiet murder than in a noisy party?
Pardon me, but could you tell me where the hors d'oeuvres are?
- I was looking for a piece of cheese.
- Cheese?
-  - Thank you.
Would you like some champagne?
No, I'm sorry, but I'm not drinking.
I notice you're not drinking either.
It's humble custom to drink only tea.
I took the privilege of ordering some.
Oh, here it is now.
Permit me, please.
Would you care to join me?
Good idea.
Do you like your tea strong?
Just a couple of more dunks, please.
Here, I'll take that.
- To your health.
- To yours.
I've heard of strong tea, but this is ridiculous.
Pardon me.
Are you enjoying yourself?
Oh, yes.
Thank you very much.
It's a delightful party.
Yes, it is.
American men.
Mmm.
So exciting, so suave, so-- so debonair.
Well, thank you for saying so.
You just put the lit end of the cigarette in your mouth.
Yes, well, that way I don't get too many ashes on the floor.
Oh, I feel terribly warm.
Would you be kind enough to open a window?
Certainly.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
I would like to propose a toast to the ladies of the contest-- the most beautiful girls in the world.
What happened?
Well, either KAOS just lost one of its agents or the people in this hotel just aren't tipping enough.
Here's your umbrella.
Have you taken enough pictures yet?
Are you kidding?
I'm on my third handle.
Listen, I've got to get the film from this back to the laboratory and have it run through the computer.
Then we'll know which one of the contestants is the rotten, vicious, evil KAOS killer.
Oh, I hope it's nobody nice.
Look, the party's beginning to break up.
Now I am going to leave.
I want you to stay here in this room.
Don't budge.
Have you still got the gun I gave you last night?
- I sure have.
- Where is it?
- On the table next to the bed.
- Good.
Back at your apartment.
Have you got a headache?
Carlson, this film was smuggled out of KAOS headquarters.
It contains pictures of their top staff, codebooks and maps of their global network.
We've got to be especially careful with it.
It cannot be duplicated.
I'll stand by while you develop it.
I understand, Chief.
I'll use extra fine developer.
- Would you close the door, please?
- Oh, yeah.
Careful now.
Max: Carlson?
Anybody here?
Carlson, are you in there?
Both: Don't open the door!
Whatcha got there, Chief?
Nothing, Max.
Absolutely nothing.
Well, I've got something here-- pictures of every girl at that hotel.
Process it, Carlson.
Carlson, have you noticed that the Chief is getting a little moody lately?
Max: Miss Transmania?
We've identified her as the KAOS agent.
Now look at this picture.
Who's this, Chief?
That's Dimitri Sokolov, a deadly KAOS agent.
Now look at this picture.
Why, that's Miss Transmania's chaperone.
Wrong, Max.
That's Sokolov.
That's Sokolov?
What's he been taking, hormones?
Max, Sokolov is not her chaperone.
He's her husband.
These KAOS agents are in the room next to Tisha's.
I've got to get back to the hotel.
She's in danger.
Max, whatever you do, remember rule five of code 19.
Uh, I've forgotten rule five, Chief.
But I know rule six.
- Rule six?
- Yes, Chief.
Rule six states that all CONTROL agents must memorize rule five before proceeding to rule six.
- Max.
- Yes, Chief?
Do the words "get out" mean anything to you?
Bye.
Well, she started it.
All right, inside.
Come on, move.
All right, get over there.
Okay, let the girl go.
Now back up against that wall.
Come on, move.
Now turn around and put your hands up.
Come in.
Miss Formosa, this is no time for tea.
Is always time for tea.
Tea refreshes.
Dimitri: Good work, comrade.
You will receive a hero's medal from our government.
You see, my country also wants daughter of famous American scientist.
But we're all working for the same cause.
Comrade, we're all members of KAOS.
That is true, but your brand of KAOS is weak and confused.
Only in our country is their pure KAOS.
And now Mr. Smart, you're about to become an ex-control agent.
Wait a minute.
Couldn't I just resign?
Golly gee, that wasn't very nice, was it?
No, it wasn't.
But I must say that you've handled yourself very well, Tisha, in the midst of all this violence and horror and deceit.
Well, after all, it is my third beauty contest.
Max, you did a fine job.
Well, thank you, Chief.
You know, there's one thing that puzzles me about all this though.
I don't understand how the computer failed to identify the KAOS agent who was posing as Miss Formosa.
I'm sure I sent in a picture of her.
Let me show you, Max.
Here are different girls from that same area of the world.
This one is the KAOS agent.
This one is a student.
This is the real contestant.
This one's a dental technician.
The computer's only human after all.
I see, Chief.
To the computer, they all looked alike.
Hello?
Oh, yes, Carlson.
Right away.
I have to go down to the lab to see Carlson.
- Wait here, Max.
I'll be right back.
- Right, Chief.
CONTROL headquarters.
Code 16?
Hang on, 27.
We'll get you out.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
All personnel stand by.
Code 16.
Code 16.
Red alert!
Red alert!
Here, Larrabee, take this.
Chief: Max, who sent in the Code 16?
Agent 27, Chief.
I've got to contact the White House.
Chief, what is a Code 16?
Invasion from outer space.
Put me through to the president.
Hello, 27, this is the Chief.
Who is it, the Martians?
Code 15?
!
Max, this is a Code 15, not 16!
Missed it by that much.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Max!
- 99.
Agent 77 is up on top posing as a building inspector.
- Good.
- I don't know, Max.
Frank Lloyd Joshua's up there with him.
And since he owns Jericho Construction Company, he may be familiar with all the building inspectors.
Hmmm.
In that case, he may be aware that Agent 77 is an imposter.
I'd better contact the Chief immediately.
Right, Max.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
This is 86 calling CONTROL.
Come in, CONTROL.
Hello?
This is CONTROL.
Go ahead, Max.
- Can you read me?
- I read you loud and clear.
Good.
Listen, Chief, I want you to congratulate Carlson on his ingenuity in putting a telephone in a magazine.
- I'll tell him, Max.
- Only the next time, tell him to use a later issue in order to avoid suspicion.
This one has a picture of Ronald Reagan on the cover.
Why would a picture of Ronald Reagan invite suspicion?
Because he's dancing with Betty Grable.
Max, are you at your post?
Yes, Chief.
I'm on the southwest corner of 41st Street, observing the construction of a 42-story building.
You're on the northeast corner, and it's 42nd Street.
And it's a 41-story building.
Max?
Max, why have you stopped talking?
Why should I talk?
You disagree with everything I say.
Max, three other buildings put up by the Jericho Company have mysteriously blown up after completion.
Now, those buildings house agencies working on our space program.
We've got to find out how KAOS is blowing up those buildings and stop them.
Has he discovered anything that could give us a clue?
I don't know, Chief.
I haven't heard from him yet.
He's up on top of the building now inspecting it.
That must be Agent 77.
He's reporting in now, Chief.
- Well, Carlos?
- You were right, Mr. Joshua.
There is no such man listed as building inspector.
A CONTROL agent, no doubt.
- Get rid of him.
- A pleasure.
Hey!
Catch!
Agent 77 has stopped sending.
- Why?
- Max, look!
Hold on, Chief, I think I see him coming now.
Max, why have you stopped talking?
Oh, Max, how terrible.
Yes, broke his glasses and everything.
Agent 77 must have discovered something really significant.
Yes, and he was probably trying to relay it to us just before he died.
Whatever it was, it was important enough to cost him his life.
Do you mean that Agent 77 didn't fall off that building accidentally as Frank Lloyd Joshua reported?
No, 99, he was probably pushed.
Pushed?
!
At that height?
What's the matter with those workmen?
Don't they know that someone could get hurt?
Max, somebody did get hurt.
A man was killed.
There, what did I tell you?
For some time now, we've suspected Joshua of being affiliated with KAOS.
I think what happened today leaves little doubt.
Chief, if the last three buildings that Joshua constructed were all mysteriously blown up, then why was he awarded another government contract?
- Yes, Chief, why?
- That's a good question, 99.
Joshua always underbids the other companies, yet he always uses the best building materials.
But Chief, if he uses superior building materials and underbids the other companies, then how can he stay in business?
- Yes, Chief, how?
- I'm glad you asked that, 99.
We suspect that KAOS secretly owns the Jericho Construction Company.
But Chief, isn't the Pentagon suspicious that all of Jericho's buildings blow up a year after they're finished?
- Yes, Chief, aren't they?
- That's a very good point, 99.
There never has been any clue as to how the buildings blew up.
The Pentagon is convinced it was outside sabotage.
- But how?
- That's what Max is going to find out.
Me?
Why me?
Why not her?
She's the one who asked the question.
Max, this job calls for an agent with high intelligence, sharp judgment and total fearlessness.
Well, okay, Chief, if you put it that way.
Unfortunately I can't spare 99 right now.
- Max, you're going to Las Vegas.
- Las Vegas?
Max, you're going to Las Vegas because Joshua will be there.
And he'll be staying at the same hotel with Baron Von Krupa.
You know who Baron Von Krupa is, don't you?
A German drummer?
You tell him, 99.
Max, the Baron owns the Von Krupa Explosives Company.
He backed Germany in the last two world wars.
- Two flops in a row, eh?
- Max, please.
There must be some connection between the Baron's explosives business and the blowing up of Joshua's building.
If they're both going to be in Las Vegas at the same hotel at the same time, there must be an important meeting going on.
Right, 99.
Now, when these two men meet, I want every word of their conversation recorded.
That's not going to be easy, Chief.
It will be with this.
A silver dollar?
It only looks like a silver dollar.
It's really a transistorized microphone capable of picking up a whisper from 20 or 30 feet and then transmitting it That's a great buy for a buck.
at headquarters to record the conversation.
Here are your tickets.
We made reservations for you at the Arabian Nights Hotel.
- Right, Chief.
I'm on my way.
- Good luck, Max.
Oh, and Max, remember-- both Joshua and the Baron are ruthless, cold-blooded killers.
From the minute you set foot in that hotel, you'll be facing constant, extreme danger.
And loving it.
Good evening, sir.
Would you care for a table?
No, thank you.
I'll sit at the bar.
- Ah, Monsieur Joshua, good evening.
- Hello, Martini.
- Has the Baron come in yet?
- Waiting for you at your table, sir.
- Baron, forgive me for being late.
- That's quite all right.
-  - An unexpected intrusion at the construction site this morning.
I was forced to take a later flight.
- It's coming in now, Chief.
- And clear as a bell.
The microphone in that coin is highly sensitized.
- Cigars, cigarettes?
-  - What's happening?
- I don't know.
I heard the cigarette girl's voice.
Now all I hear is a lot of change jingling.
Do you think Max bought a pack of cigarettes and paid for it with the silver-dollar microphone?
could possibly be that stupid.
I guess you're right.
And there's a very good chance that's exactly what he did.
- Thank you very much.
- Uh, pardon me, miss, but you have a silver dollar that belongs to me.
What makes you think it belongs to you?
I was tossing it up into the air and it accidentally fell into your tray as you went by.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Here you are.
- Oh, thank you.
- Cigars-- - Pardon me, miss.
This isn't it.
What do you think you're doing?
I'm looking for my silver dollar.
You gave me the wrong one.
What's the difference?
A dollar's a dollar.
Mine is a very special silver dollar.
- Oh, here it is.
- How can you be sure it's yours?
Eh yes.
- It has my name on it.
- Oh, is that so?
- Well, what's your name?
- Eh, E Pluribus Unum.
Wise guy.
- You shouldn't have done that.
- Why not?
Because heat is bad for transistors.
- Cigarettes?
- Can I have a pack of gum please?
- All I got's a 20.
- Oh, $20, well let's see, that's one that's five I should have another one here someplace.
Hold it!
Don't you know these machines are fixed?
The odds against you hitting them are 1000 to one.
Will you leave me alone?
I gave up smoking, isn't that enough?
- You hit the jackpot!
- Yeah.
Hey, you're lucky for me.
If you hadn't missed down here, I never would have hit the jackpot.
I'm indebted to you.
Here, let me help you.
Touch my money, I break your arms.
I was just trying to help.
I don't need no help, kid.
Here's a buck for your trouble.
Uh, do you mind if I take this one?
This isn't even any good.
This must have fallen from your pocket, monsieur.
Thank you.
So, Baron, you say that the nitroglycerin will arrive at the construction site tomorrow morning.
- Ja.
- Splendid.
We are just at that phase of the construction.
Each day closer to completion is a day closer to demolition.
- Goodbye, Baron.
- Auf wiedersehen.
Pardon me, but I wonder if you'd mind if I use your ashtray?
Please do.
Turn around and keep walking.
All right, hold it.
Get your hands up against that wall.
Are you sure you've got the right man, fella?
The Baron's got a photographic memory.
He never forgets a CONTROL agent.
Look, you're making a mistake.
I just came here to gamble.
You gambled and you lost.
It's you.
I don't think I understand.
my name is Charlie Watkins, CONTROL West.
Oh.
I'm Maxwell Smart, Agent 86 out of Washington.
- Get going.
I'll cover you.
- Right.
- Charlie Watkins?
- That's right.
I'm working in disguise.
Well, Charlie, I've seen a lot of disguises in my time, but Chief, this is the original tape of the conversation between Joshua and Baron Von Krupa.
Thank you, 99.
Did you rush a copy over to the Pentagon?
Yes, I did, Chief.
And this came by messenger.
Oh, what is it?
Photographs of Agent Watkins from CONTROL West.
Oh, that's the agent who saved Max's life in Las Vegas.
- Did he arrive yet?
- Yes, he's on his way up now.
Oh good!
I can't wait to see him.
He's only been gone one day and it seems so much longer.
- Wow, who's that?
- That's Agent Watkins.
Hi, Chief.
Hello, 99.
What's the matter with her, Chief?
She just saw a picture of Charlie Watkins.
Oh, Charlie Watkins.
He saved my life, Chief.
You know, if it wasn't for his quick thinking, I might not be here now.
Yes, I know.
I notified the Pentagon, and they're gonna award Charlie Watkins a medal.
Oh, really?
Hmmm.
I'd like to be the one to pin it on him.
Max, let's get back to the case.
Right, Chief.
Now, it is my theory that Joshua places the explosives in the building as it's being erected.
But I don't understand, Chief.
How can he do that?
I don't know, but once the building goes up it's too late to do anything about it.
Now, I've gotten you a job as a member of the construction crew.
You got me a job with the Jericho Construction Company?
That's right.
Carlson's waiting for you in the lab.
He's got some special equipment for this operation.
In that case, I won't keep him waiting, Chief.
Max, before you go-- the silver dollar, please.
The silver dollar?
Max, the microphone.
Don't tell me you lost it.
Don't be ridiculous, Chief.
I wouldn't lose anything as valuable as that.
- What a relief.
- I must have spent it.
Now, let's see.
Got off the plane, I went to the magazine stand, - I bought that magazine-- - Max, that microphone cost $700!
How could you have spent it?
Of all the stupid-- Take it easy, Chief, that's a $700 magazine.
Well, hello, Carlson.
How's everything going?
Fine, up till now.
Let's get started.
First we'll take this-- - Oh good, I'm starving.
- There's nothing edible in here, 86!
This contains camouflaged communication devices.
Now, this, on the surface, appears to be nothing more than an American cheese sandwich.
However Are you kidding?
A telephone.
Why, that's fantastic.
-  Thank you.
- Does it come in any other colors?
Just basic black.
But it does come in different sandwiches-- egg salad, peanut butter and an imported liverwurst.
Hmm.
Which do you recommend?
Better try the cheese.
I just made it.
Well, so much for your lunch.
Now let's look at your tools.
- Now this-- - A hammer.
Yes, it's a hammer when you hold it this way, but when you hold it this way, it's a .
45-caliber pistol.
That's fantastic.
The old pistol-in- the-hammer trick.
Uh, what's this?
That's a wrench.
Well, I know it's a wrench, Carlson, but what does it do?
Well, you use it for tightening bolts.
And?
What do you mean, "And"?
That's all it does.
Oh.
Well, you keep working on it, Carlson.
You'll come up with something.
That was a little high and outside.
Let's try another one.
That's more like it.
Let's try it again.
-  - Oooh!
- Sorry about that.
- Hey, fella?
Hello, Chief, this is Max.
They just brought up the nitroglycerin, and Joshua has another set of blueprints which he keeps under lock and key.
Those blueprints will tell us how they put the explosives into the building.
You've got to get a look at them, Max, but be careful.
Right, Chief.
- Carlos, that new riveter?
- Hmm?
I recall seeing him in Las Vegas, and he looked familiar.
- And now he shows up here.
- Hmmm.
- That's strange.
- And there's something even stranger.
I just saw him talking into his sandwich.
I have a photo file on all CONTROL agents downstairs in my car.
And if that man is who I think he is, you've got to get rid of him.
You know how I hate to fire anyone.
Couldn't I just kill him?
- Precisely.
- Thank you.
I'll be back shortly.
Stay close to him and don't let him out of your sight.
All right, everybody, break for lunch!
Ah, here you are.
I make it a point always to eat lunch with a man his first day on the job.
That's very sweet of you, Carlos, but I'm really not hungry now.
Go on, eat, I insist.
A man does not do good work on an empty stomach.
Yes, well, I agree with you, but I'm not hungry.
Eat it.
Eat it.
Hello?
It's for you.
Hello-- - Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Gimme a hand.
I said a hand, not a foot.
All right, Mr. Smart, it's all over for you.
Not for me, Joshua, but for you.
You see, I've discovered your hollowed bricks, and I know how you blow up your buildings.
Ingenious, is it not, Mr. Smart, placing nitroglycerin inside the bricks and cementing them into designated areas of the building?
Yes, it is ingenious.
A completed building, actually an explosive skyscraper, sitting right here in the heart of Washington waiting to be detonated.
And as soon as the space research laboratories in the building have made too much progress-- a bullet striking any one of the bricks containing the nitro sets off a chain reaction of total destruction.
Thanks for filling me in, Joshua.
No harm, as you are about to die.
Don't move, Joshua.
This hammer happens to be a .
45-caliber pistol.
So is this wrench.
Oh, really?
Carlson is going to feel terrible about this.
All right, Mr. Smart, make your choice-- the .
45-caliber bullet or a 41-story fall.
Don't suppose a simple apology would do?
- No.
-  Well, Mr. Joshua, it seems that your wrench is useless.
On the contrary.
- Max, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine, Chief.
- What happened?
Who is he?
- That is Frank Lloyd Joshua.
Tried to knock me off the building.
Luckily I fell onto that girder.
And when it was lifted up, I knocked him out.
Good work, Max.
Did you find out how they did it?
Yes, Chief, I did.
You see, they took the nitro and they put it inside the hollowed bricks, and then they cemented it into the building.
Very clever.
We'd better get rid of that nitro right away-- it's highly explosive.
Where is it?
Well, Chief, while Joshua and Carlos were talking, I took the nitro out of the container and hid it.
- That was wise.
Where'd you hide it?
- In the bags of cement.
Max, they're starting to pour the cement now.
- I noticed it on our way up.
- We really fooled KAOS this time.
They think the nitro is still in the bricks, and all the time it's in the cement.
Listen, Chief, I think we'd better contact all the space agencies who are going to occupy this building and tell them.
- Tell them what?
- Not to buy expensive furniture.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Now you men have been called to this meeting because you best represent those traditions and standards that KAOS holds dear: loyalty, bravery and murder.
What I'm about to tell you is one of the most sinister plots that KAOS has ever devised against America, so I must caution you against loose talk.
Word must never leave this room.
Man: All right, all right, Schnell, out with it.
What is the plot?
Schnell: Tomorrow afternoon at Jet Space Laboratories a group of America's top space scientists will be blown to smithereens.
Man: But, Schnell, Jet Space Labs-- it is one of the most tightly guarded installations.
How do we pass their security?
Now, Petroff, I show you.
We drive right through the front gate.
Americans and their stupid coffee break.
Tomorrow afternoon at 2:15 Willie's Snack Truck will be outside the propulsion lab at precisely the same moment the space scientists will be concluding their inspection tour.
When they step outside of the building-- kaboom!
So the old bomb-in-the-snack-truck trick.
Hello, Chief?
Yes, Max, what's up?
Listen, Chief, I've just uncovered a vicious plot to murder a group of our top space scientists.
Where, Max, where?
In the next room.
Right here at the Park Savoy Hotel.
Are the scientists staying at that hotel?
No, Chief, KAOS is at this hotel.
Schnell and Petroff are here.
Schnell and Petroff?
Max, they're number one and two on CONTROL's 10-Most-Wanted Spy list.
One and two?
I thought they were nine and 10.
They were, but when the last ratings came in, they jumped to one and two.
But I don't understand, Chief.
KAOS has better killers and murderers than Schnell and Petroff.
That's the way our business works, Max.
They don't go by how good you are, they go by the ratings.
There you have it, gentlemen.
That concludes our briefing.
Now remember, the key word is secrecy.
Schnell here.
Are you sure?
All right, I will take care of it.
That was KAOS communications.
Smart is in the next room.
- Smart?
- Shh!
He's listening.
You stay here, you come with me.
Have you got a pencil, Chief?
Okay, write this down.
At exactly 2:15-- -  - Hold on, Chief.
I think there's someone at the door.
Where am I?
You're in General Hospital, Mr. Smart.
You were in an automobile accident.
An automobile accident.
Yes, of course.
I've got to get out of here.
Mr. Smart, you have a head injury.
Now the doctor insists you be kept here for observation.
Yes, well, you tell the doctor that I've got to get out of here.
The security of the nation may be at stake.
Well, you'll have to think of a better one than that.
- Where are my clothes?
- Mr. Smart!
No one leaves this hospital without the doctor's permission.
I'll get him here right away.
Doctor, Dr. Mangle.
It's Mr. Smart in number 612.
Yes, Nurse, what about him?
Bad news, Doctor.
He's feeling better.
I was afraid of this.
Well, he wants to leave the hospital immediately.
Yes, he'll go directly to CONTROL and KAOS will punish us for destroying their most ingenious plan.
- We must silence Smart.
- But how, Doctor, how?
Hmm.
Prepare the hypodermic.
- The death syrup?
- Yes, and sterilize the needle.
Sterilize the needle?
But if we're gonna kill him-- Nurse!
I may be working for KAOS, but I am still a doctor.
Woman over P.A.: Dr. Mangle, telephone.
- Dr. Mangle, telephone.
- Dr. Mangle here.
Yes, Krauss, thank you.
What is it, Doctor?
Chief of CONTROL and 99, they're on their way up to see Smart.
Well, it's too late to give him the hypo now.
And once they've talked to him, we're lost.
These amnesia pills-- it's our only chance.
Amnesia pills, Doctor?
Yes, the newest discovery from the laboratories of KAOS.
One of these pills and the victim loses his memory for one hour.
That's a great step forward in medicine.
Yes, and you can get them without a prescription.
Now get going.
You stall off the visitors - while I administer to the patient.
- All right.
Mr. Smart.
Mr. Smart?
Yes, Doctor.
Mr. Smart, what are you doing in that suit?
Oh, well, I know it needs pressing, but after all, I was in a wreck.
Mr. Smart, you are recovering from a very serious accident.
Now I insist you get back into that bed and take one of these pills immediately.
I'm sorry, Doctor, I have no time for that.
My country is in danger.
Well, unless you take this pill, you'll die.
I may be patriotic, but I'm not a fanatic.
All right, Doctor, I'll take this pill, but then I'm leaving.
I must contact my Chief immediately.
Oh, Max!
Thank heaven you're all right.
Who are you people?
What do you want?
Doctor, what's wrong?
Well, he's had a slight concussion.
His memory has become affected.
Max, it's me, - the Chief.
- The Chief?
Well, you don't look like an Indian to me.
- Max!
- Please, madam, who are you?
I'm 99.
Well, you look pretty good for your age.
Max, don't you remember me?
Yes, you are the one with the cold hands.
Max, we both work for CONTROL.
You're an agent.
An agent?
That's funny.
I always wanted to be a radio announcer.
Chief: Max, this is important, try to remember.
We were talking on the phone last night.
You were telling me about a plot to kill our space scientists.
Did you call the police?
Doctor, we must have this information.
Isn't there something you can do?
I'm afraid not.
These things take time.
Chief, maybe when we get Max back to headquarters he'll start to remember.
- Remember what?
- It's our only hope.
Doctor, we've got to take him with us.
It's urgent.
All right, if it is absolutely necessary, but I insist that he take one of these pills every hour.
One pill every hour.
What are they, Doctor?
It's a new drug essential to his recovery.
Now, if he fails to take just one at the prescribed time his loss of memory could become permanent.
Oh, he'll remember.
Won't you, Max?
Of course I'll remember.
You're the Chief, you're 99 and you're the doctor.
No, Max, she's 99, he's the doctor and I'm the Chief.
Oh, well, I may not remember names, but I never forget a face.
Come on, Max.
Think, Max, think!
I am thinking.
I'm trying to think, I just can't seem to get my thoughts in focus.
Well, let's go over it all again.
Now the last thing you said to me on the phone was that KAOS was plotting to kill some of our nation's top space scientists.
- I said that?
- Yes.
Well, then it must be true.
I wouldn't lie about a thing like that.
Max, nobody is accusing you of lying.
We just want to know where and how it will happen.
Try to remember, Max, time is running out.
It's almost 12:30.
- 12:30?
- Yes.
Does that mean anything to you?
Of course.
It's lunchtime.
How about some Chinese food?
Maybe I'm pushing you too hard.
Maybe we should go out and get a snack.
Snack?
- Did you say snack?
- Yes.
Wait a minute.
Snack-- snack.
I seem to remember something about-- - something about a snack truck.
- What about a snack truck?
Well, KAOS said that they were gonna get this truck and-- - Time for your pill, Max.
- Hold it a second, 99.
Chief, you know what the doctor said.
If he doesn't take this pill on time his amnesia may become permanent.
All right, but make it fast.
He was just onto something.
All right, Max, now what about the snack truck?
What snack truck?
Who are you people?
What do you want?
What am I doing here?
It's hopeless, 99.
He can't remember anything.
Maybe if I take him back to the hotel room where he made the phone call maybe the familiar surroundings will strike a chord.
Wait a minute, I've got an idea.
Why don't I go back to the hotel room with this young lady and maybe the familiar surroundings will strike a chord?
He's beginning to sound like himself, 99.
We have a little surprise for you, Max.
- A surprise?
- Yes, Max.
Here.
The keys to your apartment?
You little tiger, you.
- Max, stop that!
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
Max, they're the keys to your new car.
- Oh, my new car?
- Yes, it's waiting for you downstairs.
Come on, I'll show it to you.
Now notice these switches, Max.
Now this one will send an oil slick out of the tailpipe.
That's very handy in case you're being pursued.
Now this knob will produce smoke billows from the front or the rear depending upon which way you turn it.
Now this switch controls the antenna.
Actually it's a radar device which projects an image here on this screen.
How do you like it?
Oh, that's great, Chief.
And I like the accessories.
They are better than the Edsel.
Max, this car has some fantastically clever devices.
For instance, under the hood.
- What's this, Chief?
-  It's the horn, Max.
Well, that's not so clever.
Max, will you push the switch on the extreme left, please?
It's a high-velocity .
50-caliber machine gun, Max.
- Now over here-- - What's this?
That's the trigger, Max.
Sorry about that, Chief.
Lower the machine gun, will you?
Now in case you should have a passenger and it turned out to be a KAOS agent, do this.
Say, that's great, Chief.
Why, they'll sell a million of these cars.
Every married man in the country will want one.
Within an hour it'll be too late to save those scientists.
Oh, here's 99 now.
You two get over to that hotel.
All right, Max, it's all yours.
Oh, well, that's very sweet of you.
I mean, to give an expensive present like this to me and you a perfect stranger.
I am not a perfect stranger!
Well, you could be if you wouldn't holler so much.
Why are we parking behind the hotel, Max?
Because if we park out front there's always a chance of being blocked by other cars, and we may have to leave in a hurry.
Good thinking, Max.
What do we do now, Max?
Eh, yes, well, I'll just back the car up a little and let you out and then I'll pull it in again.
But that's not gonna work, Max.
- You'll still be stuck.
- Good thinking.
It's more important for you to get into that hotel room than it is for me.
Come on, let's climb out over the top.
Hey, you'd better give me your hand.
- I won't fall, Max.
- No, but I might.
Oh, wait a minute, what about the luggage?
- What luggage?
- Well, don't you remember?
Every CONTROL agent has a set of various kinds of luggage in his trunk.
- What for?
- For emergencies such as this.
We can't go into a hotel lobby without any luggage.
It'll arouse suspicion.
Hmm, maybe you're right.
- Okay, let's go get a suitcase.
- Right.
Oh, no, not that one, Max.
That's full of samples.
That's for when you pose as a traveling salesman.
Well, why don't I just tell the desk clerk that I'm a traveling salesman?
How would you explain me?
I could say that you were the farmer's daughter.
Use the honeymoon kit, Max.
- The honeymoon kit?
- Sure.
We used it before and it worked just fine.
Oh, really, you and I?
Together we used it?
Oh, Max, don't tell me you don't remember that either.
No, I don't.
Remember, Max, when we get inside if they ask if we're married, I'm Mrs. Smart.
Right.
Who am I?
- Mr. Smart.
- Good.
It worked out perfectly.
Max, wait!
Cradlemeyer, the KAOS agent is out front.
We can't let him see us.
Wait a minute, 99.
That looks like a hall window.
Now if I could just get in that window But how can you, Max?
We don't have a ladder.
Hmm I've got it!
The ejector seat.
What are you gonna do, Max?
I'm gonna put myself into this ejector seat and then you're gonna push that button and shoot me up to that window.
Well, what about me?
Well, once I get up there I'll find a rope someplace, lower it down and pull you up.
Are you sure this is gonna work?
Don't worry.
Once I'm up there I'll grab that window ledge.
It can't miss.
Go ahead, press the button.
- Okay, let's go.
- Where to, Max?
The hospital.
I think I just broke every bone in my body.
Max, look, there's Cradlemeyer.
He's leaving.
Good.
Let's drive around and go in the front way.
Well, according to the register, this is the room you occupied, Max.
Does anything ring a bell?
- Yes, but I find that hard to believe.
- What, Max?
Well, that I would stay in such a cheap crummy room.
Why, there isn't even a television set here.
Max, you were here because you uncovered a KAOS plot to kill our top scientists.
Don't you remember anything?
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I used to have such a brilliant mind-- quick and incisive.
Now I can barely remember my own name.
- Think, Max, think.
- Max, that's it, that's my name.
Max, maybe if you could retrace all of the events leading up to the phone call, then maybe you could remember.
- You think so?
- Mm-hmm.
Well, it's worth a try.
Now let me see - I remember coming into the room.
- Good.
- I was with a bellboy.
- Right.
I remember because I asked him to open the windows, fluff up the pillows, get me some clean towels and a pitcher of ice water.
- Then I gave him a dime.
- What did he say?
You don't remember?
Well, yes, I remember, but I'm ashamed to repeat it.
Max, keep trying to remember the events leading up to the phone call.
Phone call?
Yes, what were you doing exactly before you made the call?
What was I doing?
Let me see now what was I doing?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, I remember.
I was listening against this wall.
Good, Max, keep going.
I had my electronic bug in my pocket, and I took it out, and I placed it against this wall, just about here.
- And what did you hear?
- The couple in the next room fighting.
No, Max, there was no couple in the next room.
- That was Schnell and Petroff.
- Schnell and-- Schnell and Petroff, of course.
And Cradlemeyer, now I remember.
They were hatching a plot, a plot to kill some of our top scientists.
What are they gonna do, Max?
The snack truck.
The snack truck.
They're gonna rig a bomb on a snack truck and blow it up!
Of course.
The old bomb- in-the-snack-truck trick.
That's it.
Where are they gonna do it, Max?
Uh, let's see, this afternoon.
- This afternoon at 2:15 at-- -  -  It's 1:30.
- No, 2:15.
No, Max, it's 1:30.
It's time for your pill.
- Oh.
- Here.
Thank you, I'm glad you remembered.
Okay, Max, now where?
Where is this going to happen?
Where is what going to happen?
The snack truck!
Oh, is the snack truck here?
Good.
I'm starving.
I'll have a ham and cheese sandwich.
How about you?
Oh, Max!
Our top scientists are gonna be blown up by a snack truck.
We have less than an hour left.
An hour?
My watch must have stopped.
No, Max, that's not your watch.
That's your wrist recorder.
Wait a minute.
Did you have this on last night?
Well, I must have.
I don't remember taking it off.
Oh, let's hope you had it turned on.
Schnell: What I'm about to tell you is one of the most sinister plots that KAOS has ever devised against America.
That's Schnell!
You were recording while you were listening.
A group of America's top space scientists will be blown to smithereens.
Petroff: But Schnell, Jet Space Labs-- Come on, Max, I'll call the Chief on the way.
What is it?
There's someone in the hall.
We may have been followed.
Is it KAOS?
It's worse.
It's the house detective.
Schnell: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thanks a lot, everybody.
Enjoy your snacks.
I'll see you tomorrow.
Keep those missiles flying.
Petroff.
Obviously, Smart's amnesia is working.
We couldn't have gone this far if CONTROL knew the plan.
You're right.
I think we can proceed with safety.
After the bomb explodes, in the excitement we will go out the front gate.
Cradlemeyer will be waiting for us in the car.
Schnell, look, the scientists.
- They're coming.
- Quick, Petroff, set the timer and get out of here.
- It's set to go off.
- All right, let's go.
Stand back!
Get away from that truck!
Take cover!
Protect yourselves!
Max, look, they're stealing a jeep.
Well, they won't get far.
This is Maxwell Smart.
This is Maxwell Smart.
Attention all gates!
This is a code 10!
Repeat, a code 10!
Quick, Petroff, we'll go the other way.
- Quick, open the gate!
- Do you have a pass?
Here, I'm with CONTROL.
Take a look at this.
Oh, I'll open it right away.
Max, there they are!
Head for the south end of the camp.
There's a wall.
We'll scale it and escape.
Schnell, they're gaining on us!
I will take care of them.
They're shooting, Max!
Not only that, but they are speeding!
I'll give them a blast with the machine gun.
No, Max, that's the radio.
Radio?
What's a radio doing in the radio?
It must be that button on the right.
Are you sure you're right?
Positive.
Push it!
That's the smoke screen!
Max, the smoke!
I can't see!
That's funny, I'm having the same trouble on my side.
Good work, Max.
You forced them to crash.
All right, Schnell, Petroff, get out of there, come on.
Max!
Well, Chief, you got here just in time.
Here they are, and we've got 'em all the way down the line.
You can throw the book at them-- murder, espionage and dispensing food without a license.
All right, Larrabee, you and 99 take 'em down to headquarters.
Right, Chief.
All right, let's go.
Move out.
We got Cradlemeyer outside of the gate.
Are you all right?
I got here as soon as I could.
Yes, I'm fine, Chief, but you look terrible.
Here, you'd better sit down and take a rest.
We went 90 miles an hour all the way.
Well, that's too fast for a man your age, Chief, especially without a hat.
You're right, I-- I guess I overdid it.
You just take it easy, Chief, and I'll drive you down to headquarters.
- Feel like a cigarette?
- That's very thoughtful of you, Max.
- Light?
- Yeah.
Oh boy, is he gonna tell me off  as soon as he comes to.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Woman over P.A.: Flight 93 from Boston now arriving, gate 7.
Flight 93 from Boston now arriving, gate 7.
Max, why does Professor Whitaker have to transmit his rocket-fuel formula to the American scientists verbally?
Because, 99, the formula is so vital that the British refuse to have it transmitted any other way.
There's absolutely nothing on paper.
It's all in Professor Whitaker's head.
I'll bet there are a lot of countries that'd like to get hold of the formula.
You bet your sweet life there are-- China, Russia, Uruguay Max, Uruguay doesn't have any rockets.
Of course they don't have any rockets, 99, but if they ever get some, they'll have the fuel for them.
The Chief says that British Intelligence has assigned an agent named Alex Chain to protect the professor, and that the mission is considered so vital that he's listed as expendable.
Woman over P.A.: Flight 704 from London now arriving That's their flight, Max.
Flight 704 from London now arriving They were supposed to meet us here, weren't they?
- Yes, they said they would be here.
- Yes, all right.
- Professor Whitaker?
- Yes?
- I'm Maxwell Smart.
- Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
This is Agent 99.
- Nice to meet you.
This is Mr. Chain.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
Now, Professor Whitaker, if you'll come with us.
- Yes, of course.
- P.A.: Professor Whitaker, phone call.
- Excuse me, please.
- Professor Whitaker, phone call.
Excuse me.
Max, look!
Good work, 13.
- Anytime, 86.
- It's a lucky thing you were in there.
I've been in here for 72 hours without a break.
You must be starved.
No, but I'm dying for a smoke.
Max, at this moment, America's greatest scientists are on their way here to meet with Professor Whitaker.
Will our top scientist, Professor Einstock, be here?
I had to pull a lot of strings, but I finally convinced his employer that it was essential for the security of our nation.
- Who does he work for, Chief?
- The Wattel Toy Company.
The meeting is going to be held here in this office tomorrow morning.
In the meantime, to ensure Professor Whitaker's safety, I want him to stay at your apartment tonight.
Oh, not my apartment again, Chief.
I'm getting complaints from the landlord about the gun battles in the hall and the bombs in the lobby and the knife fights in the elevator.
When you rent an apartment to a secret agent, you'd better expect those things.
But, Chief, he doesn't know I'm a secret agent.
Then how do you explain people attacking you and shooting at you?
Well, I told him I worked for the Bureau of Internal Revenue.
Max, a hotel is too vulnerable.
It has to be your apartment.
With all those secret security devices and protective weapons, it's the only place where the professor will be really safe.
Now, Max, I want you to use all anti-kidnapping measures.
Kidnapping?
But they tried to kill him at the airport.
No, Max, those were not conventional bullets they used.
They used tranquilizer pellets.
They intended to kidnap the professor.
Max, Whitaker and Chain are outside waiting for you.
I want you to take them to you apartment.
Now remember, KAOS is expert in the art of kidnapping.
I know, Chief.
Do you remember the time that KAOS kidnapped Agent 95?
They tortured him for 30 days.
By the time we rescued him, he was a total loss.
Why, he was ranting and raving.
You couldn't understand a word he said.
- Whatever happened to Agent 95?
- He went into politics.
Gentlemen, Professor Whitaker has arrived safely because of the blundering of Agent Sidney here.
Ah.
The rest of you have never seen pictures of Professor Whitaker.
I want you to examine these photographs and burn his face into your mind.
Now these are pictures of Alex Chain, the British Secret Service agent assigned to guard the professor.
Remember his face also.
Now before we continue with the business at hand, Agent Sidney here will give us the KAOS financial report.
For the fiscal year just ended, KAOS Incorporated showed a gross income of $980 million, which after taxes left us a net income of $980 million.
The figures speak for themselves.
We've had a lousy year.
Our stock is dropping rapidly.
It hasn't been this low since the day Hitler died.
Sidney: We must kidnap Professor Whitaker and make him divulge the secret rocket formula and sell it on the open market.
Otherwise there'll be no Christmas bonus come Mussolini's birthday.
Now if you happen to find yourself looking down the barrel of a KAOS revolver, you merely ask for a last drink.
Nobody could refuse a chap a request like that.
Now, when you release the handle on this soda siphon, it triggers that wall lamp over there.
Watch.
It never misses.
Yes yes yes.
Dastardly clever.
Brilliant.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Are you all right, Professor?
Yes yes yes yes.
But don't worry about me.
Go ahead and answer the phone.
But the phone isn't ringing.
It isn't?
Oh.
Well, perhaps they'll call back later.
Now, Professor, this is an extremely clever device in case you're taken by surprise.
- You reach over and press a button.
- What's it do?
Well, it releases a net from the ceiling that falls and traps your assailant.
How ingenious.
Is it this button here?
No, it is not that button there.
It's this button here.
Now I must warn you, Professor, never, never at any time sit in this chair.
- Why not?
- Because there is a revolver concealed in the arm of this chair, and when you sit on the cushions, it releases the trigger mechanism.
Anybody standing in front of this chair will be killed instantly.
Oh, dear.
Well, I'm glad you told me, Mr. Smart.
Is there anything else we should be acquainted with?
Yes, there's one more thing, Professor.
Come with me.
An invisible shield.
A ceiling-to-floor, wall-to-wall, plastic shield.
Bulletproof, airtight, and completely invisible.
Well, where is it?
How does it work?
It's really quite simple, Professor.
It works when I sit on the edge of the desk like this.
I have just lowered the invisible shield.
Now, nobody on that side of the room can reach us.
Bullets, poison gas, nothing that KAOS can dream up can reach us.
Why, you can't even see a reflection or a glare.
Yes, I know, Professor.
But believe me, the invisible shield - is right behind you.
-  Who moved the desk?
I must personally congratulate your CONTROL scientists for creating such brilliant methods of protection.
Thank you very much.
That's very kind of you.
It's quite a compliment.
Yes yes.
Well, with such devices and you and Mr. Chain to guard me, my life is 100% safe.
- You're very kind, sir.
-  Oh dear!
Well, would you believe Professor Whitaker is sound asleep.
Good.
Well, I hope this won't be too uncomfortable for you.
Oh, don't give it a thought.
What are you doing?
Standard procedures in cases of joint security.
One of us gets up, he'll wake the other one up.
But as I remember this, you're supposed to tie one end of this to the professor.
I know that, Chain, but I didn't have a piece of string long enough.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
The door.
There's somebody at the door.
Gentlemen, th-th there's somebody at the door!
Oh!
Get him!
Get him!
There's somebody at the window!
Then who's this?
It's the professor.
Sorry about that, Professor.
Well, I guess that takes care of our late visitor.
- Yes.
- Good shooting, Professor.
Oh, well, uh, thank you.
Uh, from hunting grouse, you know.
Well, now that they've tried and failed, I guess we can all go back to bed and get a good night's sleep, undisturbed.
You're underestimating the enemy, my friend.
KAOS never gives up.
I give up.
This just hasn't been your day, has it, Sidney?
So why do I allow you to remain with KAOS?
I give you opportunity after opportunity, and yet you keep failing!
So why do I keep giving you another chance?
Sidney, tell me why.
I don't know, Uncle Boris.
Sidney, pass me the boom-boom box.
Good, Sidney.
Very good.
You see, when you put your mind to it, you can do something.
Gentlemen, I have placed a bomb in the living room of the apartment that will kill Agents Smart and Chain.
But Professor Whitaker-- he'll be killed and we'll lose the formula.
The professor is asleep in the upstairs bedroom.
He'll be safe from the blast.
The bomb is remotely controlled from this box.
When I press that button, the bomb is activated to explode at exactly five minutes from now.
What's wrong now?
I have to put this alarm clock someplace.
The ticking is keeping me awake.
Smart, that clock isn't ticking.
It's an electric alarm clock.
Oh.
Then it's probably a bomb.
Both: A bomb?
!
Get ahold of everything that ticks and throw it out the window!
Ah, ship here.
This one.
What are you doing?
That was no clock!
That was a priceless vase!
- Oh, I'm sorry about that, old bean.
- I say, what's going on here?
It's nothing, Professor.
KAOS just planted a bomb in my apartment.
- Shh!
-  Our watches.
Quick, get rid of your wristwatches.
Yes, you've got it.
Here, here.
- Shh!
-  It's still here.
It's coming from the desk.
- It's coming from the desk.
- It's coming from the desk.
It's doming from the cesk.
It's "doming" from the "cesk"?
What are you talking about?
Shh!
The bomb must be planted somewhere in the desk.
Now let's see.
Wait a minute.
That pack of cigarettes I've never seen that before.
That's not even my brand.
- It's not my brand either.
- And I smoke a pipe.
Well, then, KAOS must have disguised the bomb as a pack of cigarettes.
Why, there's no telling how long it's been here.
It could go off any second!
I'd better get-- Don't touch it!
Don't you know that anything that portable could go off with the slightest movement?
I'll get a pail of water and we'll submerge it.
Good.
Now, Professor, look.
I want you to stand right over here.
Now I'm going to lower the invisible shield.
That way if the bomb goes off, you'll be safe.
- Yes yes.
-   Just don't sit there!
Come on!
Be careful!
Easy does it now.
In a moment, we should have ourselves an ineffective time bomb.
Or a pack of soggy cigarettes.
Oh, good show, Smart!
- Good show!
-  What kind of a crazy bomb is that?
It likes water!
Get it out!
It might explode any minute!
Have you ever dismantled one of these things?
No, but I once saw one of our agents do it.
He was awarded a medal by the queen.
Posthumously, of course.
Yes.
Well, I've got some tools here someplace.
We're gonna have to take a chance and dismantle this ourselves.
Now I want you to get a pencil and paper and write down everything I do.
In case anything goes wrong, the Chief will want a complete report.
- Right.
- Let's see here.
I'm ready to start.
"He's ready to start".
Uh-huh.
Look at this, Chain.
It has a hair-trigger release and a delayed-action circuit.
"Hair-trigger release, delayed-action circuit".
- Mind if I smoke?
- Are you kidding?
Do you know how dangerous that could be?
Oh, it's all right.
I don't inhale.
Chain, look.
There's the automatic timer.
It's set to go off at 12:00 midnight.
Well, it's almost that now.
We've only a few seconds left.
Wait a minute, now.
Easy does it.
I've got the detonator wire right here.
-  - In my hand.
The detonator wire must have pulled out when it fell on the floor.
Oh, Smart, that was a close one.
Hello.
Max, I was just about to leave the office.
How's everything going there?
Well, Chief, we just had a close one.
KAOS tried to get rid of Chain and me by planting a bomb.
- What?
- It's okay, Chief.
We dismantled it.
What about Professor Whitaker?
Is he all right?
He's perfectly okay, Chief.
- Do you want to talk to him?
- Yes.
Uh, Professor Whitaker, the Chief wants to talk to you.
-  -  Uh, Chief, I wonder if you could call back in a little while.
Professor Whitaker is sleeping.
We have failed again!
At this very moment, Professor Whitaker is at CONTROL headquarters transmitting the rocket-fuel formula to those US scientists.
It is now too late for kidnapping.
If we can't have the formula, nobody else will.
Professor Whitaker must be killed!
But we can't get into CONTROL headquarters to kill him.
Then we must find a way to draw him out of the building before he completes the transmission.
But how?
How?
Does anybody here have an answer?
What would make him walk out of a meeting of such importance?
Sidney Sidney, I asked for an answer, not a question.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Doesn't the professor have a niece attending a private school in New England?
Yes, he does.
Well, that, gentlemen, is our answer.
You've done a fine job, Max.
Another few hours and our scientists will have the last of the rocket-fuel formula.
Chief, have all of these men been checked out?
Max!
These are the most distinguished minds in our defense department.
They've devoted their lives to their country.
Each one has the Nobel Prize and the Distinguished Service Medal, and each is a Special Advisor to the President of the United States.
I know that, 99, but can they be trusted?
- Chief?
- What is it, Larrabee?
I'm sorry to disturb you, but I think this is important.
- What is it?
- It's a message for the professor.
Oh, thank you.
Excuse me, professor.
This wire just came in from your niece.
- Cynthia?
Is she all right?
- Oh, yes, she's fine, but there's an urgency involved.
I thought - you ought to see it right away.
- Oh, thank you.
- What is it, Chief?
- The professor's niece is leaving school and eloping to Mexico.
She's changing planes at the Washington airport and wants her uncle to meet her.
- She'll only have a few minutes.
- Just like her mother-- beautiful but headstrong.
Strange.
She never mentioned anyone in her letters.
Professor, under the circumstances, I'm afraid I can't let you go.
Oh, but I must.
The duty of a guardian sometimes exceeds the duty of a scientist.
- I could send Chain or Smart.
- No no no no no.
This is something a girl would only discuss with her family.
I am sorry, but I must go.
Excuse me, please.
No, Chain, you stay here.
Max, you and 99 go to the airport with the professor, and be careful.
Don't worry, Chief.
We'll be all right.
Chief, I still don't trust these men.
I'm gonna station a couple of extra guards outside the door.
I want to make sure that the secret formula doesn't leave this room.
All right, Max.
It's just not like Cynthia to do something like this.
You don't think it's some kind of KAOS plot, do you, Max?
No, I don't, 99, but just to make sure, I'd better contact Agent 13.
Right.
Oh, hi, 86.
What's up?
Professor Whitaker's niece will arrive any minute, so keep your eyes open.
- Right.
- Oh, by the way, as long as I'm here, let me have a pack of cigarettes.
- King-size or regular?
- Regular.
- Filter or non-filter?
- Filter.
- Mentholated or plain?
- Plain.
- Domestic or imported?
- Forget it, I broke the habit.
Woman over P.A.: Flight 93 from Boston, now arriving, gate 7.
- That's her flight.
- Yes.
- Is that her?
- Hmm?
I believe so.
- Uncle Harold.
- Oh, yes.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Cynthia, my dear!
But if I had only reached him in time!
- I see.
- It wasn't your fault, Max.
Thank you for calling me.
You can breathe easier.
He responded to the surgery.
He's going to live.
- Oh, that's wonderful news, Chief!
- But you don't understand.
He was my assignment, and I failed!
You didn't fail, Max.
Come with me.
Chain: And so you see, gentlemen, utilizing the general concept of the third dimension carried to the fourth power, we find that MX-squared minus G2 over the speed of light gives us the equivalent of the M5 quotient.
So, Whitaker taught Chain the formula just in case.
No, Max.
Whitaker never knew the formula.
But I don't understand, Chief.
He was a scientist.
No, 99.
Chain is a scientist.
Whitaker was the agent-- the expendable agent.
But, Chief, that's impossible.
Chain looks like an agent.
Whitaker looks like a scientist.
That's what gave British Intelligence the idea of switching their roles to make Whitaker the target.
And it worked.
So that's why Chain was such an unreliable agent, and why Whitaker was such a terrific shot.
Yes, I'm sorry we couldn't let you in on the plan, Max, but they felt the fewer who knew it, the better.
I don't know, Chief.
I don't understand how British Intelligence could take such a foolish chance.
- What foolish chance?
- Well, how could they believe that KAOS would be stupid enough to think that a bumbling idiot like Chain could be a secret agent?
Well, let's just say they've gotten used to the idea, Max.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
That anonymous telephone call was right!
It sure was, 99.
Say, listen.
You don't happen to have a crowbar on you, do you?
Oh, sure, Max.
Right here.
So this is the warehouse for KAOS's smuggling ring.
- I know what they've been smuggling.
- What, Max?
- Paper.
- That's impossible, Max.
No?
Well, then they sure know how to pack cookies.
Max, look!
- Do you know what that is?
- A cookie jar?
No, Max.
It's an Etruscan urn.
That must be worth a fortune.
I'll bet it was stolen from a museum.
Sure, and then KAOS smuggled it over here to sell to a private owner.
That must be one of the ways that they're financing their operations.
- This place must be full of treasures.
-  Shh!
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Is that you, 86?
This is 74.
- He sounds like 74, Max.
- Yes, but you can't be sure.
Advance and be recognized.
Let that be a lesson to you.
Never let your guard down for a minute.
It could be a fatal mistake.
Of course, everyone's entitled to one fatal mistake.
Why did you jump me, 86?
I told you I was 74.
Well, I thought it might be a trap.
- But you saw my face.
- Not until I hit you.
What are you doing here, 74?
The Chief sent me.
He figured you might need help.
- That's ridiculous.
- Get your hands up.
Well, just don't stand there.
If you came to help, help.
You call that helping?
Smart: Siegfried!
Good evening, Smart.
- It's Siegfried.
- Yes, my old friend and bitter enemy.
Tell me, Siegfried, why did you shoot your own man?
Nitwit.
To save your life.
But you and I are sworn to kill each other on sight.
Why would you want to save my life?
Because I'm leaving KAOS.
- Leaving KAOS?
Why?
- I'm fed up.
been with them-- stealing, robbing, lying, killing, murdering-- and what did I get out of it?
Nothing!
Just a lot of fun.
Smart, listen to me.
Go and tell your Chief I am ready to cooperate with CONTROL.
Also, I will sell them some of KAOS's top secrets.
All right, Siegfried, I'll tell him.
But I don't think the Chief will trust you.
Give me one good reason why he shouldn't trust me.
Because you're a rotten, vicious, cruel, cunning, maniacal murderer.
All right, that's one.
Now give me another.
I don't like it, Max.
I just don't like it.
But we have to face the facts, Chief.
Siegfried did save my life.
Why would he do that?
He's a vicious, cold-blooded KAOS executioner.
He says that he's leaving KAOS and he's willing to cooperate with CONTROL.
- What?
- That's right.
He's fed up with KAOS.
- Why?
- Well, last year was his biggest year.
He killed 37 people.
And they didn't even give him a Christmas bonus.
If Siegfried is on the level, Chief, think of all the valuable information we can get from him.
You may be right.
Max, where does he want to meet?
In the same warehouse.
Well, all right, but if it's a trap and we get killed, you're fired.
Max, you know, I'm frightened.
- Why, Chief?
- I'm beginning to sound like you.
Max, I don't care if Siegfried did save your life.
We shouldn't be buying information from him.
- He's a murderer and a traitor.
- Chief!
Siegfried, I'm sure the Chief didn't mean anything personal by that remark.
Now look, Chief, if Siegfried has something of importance to sell, I think it's imperative that CONTROL buy it.
How can you believe a man who'd sell out his own friends?
Dummkopft.
Who else can you sell out?
You can't double-cross enemies.
He's got a point there, Chief.
All right, Siegfried, what have you got?
It's all there.
Ow!
- What is this?
- A catalog.
You pick out what you want to buy.
- What is that, Smart?
- Just a little something that our financial department dreamed up.
It lists all the prices on information that's for sale.
It's called a Blue Book.
Anything interesting over there, Chief?
I have something that would be invaluable to you-- the head of the KAOS Ladies' Auxiliary.
You can have her for 1500.
It's listed here for 1250.
Yeah, this one is special.
- Why?
- She's my sister.
Und I will give you the location of 20 KAOS agents for 500 apiece.
- Make it 400 and it's a deal.
- Sold.
All right, Siegfried, but before we pay, - we'll check out your information.
- Chief, look out!
Well, Chief, what have you got to say now?
Siegfried just saved your life.
I know, Max, you're right.
I'm sorry for what I said earlier, Siegfried.
- That's quite all right.
- Well, Chief, I think we'd better get out of here and check this information.
Siegfried, we'll meet you back here in exactly two hours.
Under the circumstances, I don't think it's such a hot idea to meet back here again.
- He's right, Max.
- We should meet someplace where KAOS would not be able to find me.
My apartment.
We'll use my apartment.
Here are the keys.
We'll meet you there in two hours.
- Splendid, Smart.
- Let's go, Max.
Shtarker, get up!
- It worked, Siegfried.
- Ja.
Und we are one step closer to realizing our glorious plans und killing Maxwell Smart.
You should have seen the look on their faces when they thought that Siegfried saved the Chief's life.
And Smart went for it?
He swallowed it hook, line and sinker.
I happen to be a most convincing actor.
You should have seen me in the KAOS workshop when I starred in "Killing of the Shrew".
Uh, "The Taming of the Shrew".
Don't tell me how to kill!
Thank you, Lily.
Pucker up.
Shtarker, we don't pucker here.
Und Lily is my personal secretary.
This goes for you too, Lily.
We also don't  here.
Now go.
Practice your shorthand.
You never know.
Someday I may even want to dictate a letter.
Now once I gain CONTROL's confidence, I will be in a position to execute Operation Big-K.
Big-K?
The robbing of Fort Knox?
But, Siegfried, this is impossible.
Fort Knox is too heavily guarded.
Und the more heavily guarded it is, the better.
I do not understand.
I will explain when the time comes.
Oh, hello, Siegfried.
Been waiting long?
- No, just got here.
- Keys.
- What keys?
- The keys to my apartment.
Oh, yes!
All right, Siegfried, the information you gave us concerning the whereabouts of those Yes, and each and every one of them is in custody right now.
Und believe me, you got the cream of the crop.
What do we do now, Chief?
The decoding machine and Siegfried's sister.
Oh, yes, where is the decoding machine, Siegfried?
It's in the airport terminal disguised as an insurance machine.
That way our agents can decode their messages coming and going.
Say, that's a great idea, Chief.
They don't even have to come into town.
Saves a lot of time.
- Und cab fare.
- And cab-- Max, I'll go in my car and pick up the decoding machine.
You and 99 go in your car and pick up his sister.
- I suggest you all go in one car.
- Why?
My sister works in the decoding machine.
Siegfried, you wait here, Max, 99, let's go.
One question, please.
Are you going to take my sister dead or alive?
- Alive.
- Good.
Then give her my love.
All right, we're CONTROL agents and this is a raid.
You're under arrest.
Let's go, lady.
Who's there?
That's got to be Shtarker.
Get over here!
Now-- und remove your foot from that wastebasket.
- I can't.
- What do you mean you can't?
My foot's a size 11, and the wastebasket's a nine.
Foot up!
Ah, you found the hidden tape recorder.
Of course I found it.
Und you, you clumsy, you ruined a perfectly good take.
- Sorry.
I'll get it right next time.
- You'd better.
This will be conclusive evidence that I really intend to leave KAOS.
Now let's go over it once more.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Okay.
- Who's there?
-  Stop it!
Did you come here to laugh or to kill?
I was only trying to make it sound good.
We don't ad lib here, Shtarker.
We stick to the lines.
Now do it again!
And do it right!
- Who's there?
- It's me, Shtarker.
How did you find me, Shtarker?
You forget-- we have ways.
So, Siegfried, you have betrayed KAOS.
What are you going to do to me, Shtarker?
What are you going to do to me?
Stupid!
Before I answer that, I want to know one thing-- have you told CONTROL about Operation Big-K?
Oh, no!
I would never divulge KAOS's master plan of the century.
Then you pull the trigger, we rub some blood on my head, I lie down on the floor, and you leave, right?
- Right.
- Okay.
I'll turn on the recorder, and we'll do it.
- Tell me, Siegfried.
- What?
- How was I?
- Pathetic.
Well, Siegfried, your information checked out.
We picked up the decoding machine and your sister says she'll never speak to you again.
- Siegfried -  Max!
- Siegfried's dead!
- Who could have done it?
Anybody.
Wait a minute, Chief.
- We'll have an answer in a minute.
- How, Max?
My secret tape recorder.
Shtarker: So, Siegfried, you have betrayed KAOS.
Siegfried: What are you going to do to me?
Shtarker: Before I answer that, I want to know one thing-- have you told CONTROL about Operation Big-K?
Siegfried: Oh, no, of course not.
I would never divulge KAOS's master plan of the century.
Shtarker: That's all I wanted to know.
Goodbye, Siegfried.
Well, that's it, Chief.
They found out he was betraying them and they had him shot.
Operation Big-K-- if we could only find out what that meant before Siegfried was killed.
Chief, look, he's moving!
He's not dead!
You're right, 99.
He's still alive.
The bullet just grazed his forehead.
Where am I?
What happened?
Smart!
You're all right, Siegfried.
One of your men tried to murder you.
Ja, I remember now.
It was Shtarker.
He wanted to know if I told you about Operation Big-K.
Big-K?
That's the one we want to know about, Chief.
What is it?
Those dirty double-crossers!
Ja, I will tell you.
Money's not important.
This is for revenge.
- Good.
What is it?
- $10,000!
- 5,000.
- 9,000.
- Six.
- Eight.
- Seven.
- Seven!
I don't bargain.
- Go on.
- K stands for Knox-- Fort Knox.
KAOS plans to hit Fort Knox tomorrow.
A full-scale attack.
Plan 45-E.
By tomorrow night, the United States will be bankrupt!
This is the Chief.
Magenta alert.
I want every available agent to draw full weapons and leave for Fort Knox immediately to head off a KAOS attack planned for sometime tomorrow.
Right.
Now, Max, here's what I want you to do.
- Chief, 99 and I are ready.
- No, Max, I want you to stay with me to conduct the awards ceremony at the CONTROL Chiefs' Convention tomorrow.
to stay with you and guard CONTROL headquarters.
- You'll be our skeleton security unit.
- 99: Right, Chief.
Und now, gentlemen, we are ready for our final phase of Operation Big-K.
But, Siegfried, it is impossible to attack Fort Knox.
Who said anything about Fort Knox?
Big-K stands for Big Knockout.
- Big Knockout?
- While all the CONTROL agents are waiting for us at Fort Knox, I will drop a gas pellet at the CONTROL Chiefs' Awards Ceremony which will knock out-- get it?
Knock out?
-- all the Chiefs!
- Ah!
- Shtarker, we don't "ah" here!
Now while they are unconscious, you kill the skeleton security unit, und we will kidnap the CONTROL Chiefs from all over the world in one swoop!
Think of it, gentlemen-- und Lily-- a $10-million ransom!
Splendid!
Ooh ooh ooh, I'm sorry.
I forgot that we don't here.
Well, once in a while it doesn't hurt.
Well, Siegfried, the Chiefs of CONTROL are really gonna be surprised when we spring you on them.
Ja, they'll be knocked out.
Just a figure of speech.
You're sure to win the Chief of the Year award this time, Chief.
Oh, thanks, 99.
I guess this is my lucky year.
You look ravishing.
Well, thank you, Siegfried.
You look pretty nice yourself.
I meant Miss 99, Smart.
Thank you, Siegfried.
I didn't know that you were from royalty.
- I'm not.
- Then why are you wearing the sash?
Oh  I burned a hole in my shirt when I was ironing it.
Max, your flower looks marvelous.
There's nothing like the scent of a fresh flower.
Uh, yes.
Well, Chief, I think I'll go down to the lab and check my notes out.
- You've got your notes right there.
- Uh, yes, but they're in invisible ink.
Thank you, and good evening, Chiefs of CONTROL.
This is Max "CONTROL Award" Smart.
I wouldn't say there are a lot of Chiefs here tonight, but the only thing that's missing is a wigwam.
Okay.
Now I'd like you to meet Mr. Harper from the accounting firm of Price, Sloan & Stern who tabulated the votes.
Oh, pardon me.
Oop!
Oh!
Right this way, Mr. Harper.
Terribly sorry about the blindfold, but this is a secret organization, you know.
Just sit down anywhere.
I think you'll find a chair more comfortable.
Now for the awards.
The first award is for Top Achievement of a CONTROL Scientist.
Envelope, please.
And the winner is Dr. Hans Svenson, for 25 years of experimental research in the field of hormones.
Are you accepting the award for Hans Svenson?
I am Hans Svenson.
I don't know what he gets for a house call, but it's worth it.
Now for our next award.
The next award is for Excellence in Judo and Karate by a CONTROL Chief.
Envelope, please.
And the winner is from Tokyo, Chief Sususi Sakamoto.
There you are, Chief.
I understand that your hands are like lightning, that when you hit a man they move so fast they can hardly be followed with the human eye.
That is true.
Well, I find that a little hard to believe, Chief.
I wonder if you could give us a little demonstration of your speed.
If Mr. Smart would be kind enough to help me out -  - I'd be most happy to.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Would you care to see it again?
- No, thank you.
-  And now for the Defector of the Year award.
Outside this room is a KAOS traitor, one of their top agents, who is now cooperating completely with CONTROL.
Although he is not going to get a Golden Pistol, he has received honorable mention for the Benedict Arnold Medallion.
So let's bring him in with a nice round of applause.
Gentlemen, this is Siegfried, the man whose information can help us destroy KAOS all over the world.
I wouldn't say there are many Chiefs here, but the only thing missing is a wigwam.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, ladies, I have spent over half my life working for KAOS, starting out as an office boy und part-time killer, but tonight I have reached the pinnacle of my profession.
Tonight you are about to see the tops in dirty tricks.
It's almost time.
And now good night!
Gentlemen!
Our $10-million babies are ready.
Come in.
You can start collecting the bodies.
Sorry, but this isn't collection day.
I hope you realize, Smart, you just ruined a terrific plan.
How did you find out?
It was really quite simple, Siegfried.
I knew something was wrong the minute you smelled my flower.
Because, you see, it was a fake flower, so I knew that you were wearing a phony nose.
Like this.
The old gas-mask- in-the-false-nose trick.
So I merely went down to the lab and got myself a CONTROL nose.
My compliments, Smart.
Well, this looks like the end of the line for you, Siegfried.
You'll get the gas chamber for this.
Und all because of my mother.
- Your mother?
- All of this could have been avoided if not for my mother.
Because when I was a little kid, my mother wouldn't get me a sled!
Why wouldn't she get me a sled, Smart?
Why?
I don't know, Siegfried.
You think maybe it was because we lived in Florida?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
- Anything yet?
- No, sir.
- Hi, Chief.
- Hello, Max.
Well, we got here as fast as we could.
What's up?
Well, I'm sorry to disturb you in the middle of the night, but we're facing a terrible crisis-- the possible destruction of the entire world.
Well, couldn't it have waited until morning?
What happened, Chief?
- KAOS has a nuclear bomb.
- Doesn't everybody?
Max, KAOS is the only private organization to have the bomb.
Don't you know what that means?
Their stock will go way up.
It means that they can use the bomb without fear of retaliation.
They are not a country, and we don't know the location of their missile base.
Could KAOS be bluffing, Chief?
Well, they promised to prove it in exactly - if we don't give them what they want.
- How?
By blowing up one of America's largest cities.
Did they say what city?
All we know is that they threatened to wipe out the city containing our finest intellectual minds and greatest leaders.
Well, at least Washington is safe.
What does KAOS want, Chief?
KAOS wants the total disarmament of every nuclear nation in the world.
But Chief, if we give them that, they'll be the only ones with the bomb.
Why, they could rule the world.
And if we don't, they'll blow it up city by city.
What are we going to do, Chief?
-  - Wait a minute.
That must be Collins.
- Who's Collins?
- Collins is our agent in Algiers.
He's checking out a lead that the KAOS missile base may be somewhere in the Sahara Desert.
What's the matter, Larrabee?
I don't know.
He stopped sending.
That means KAOS must have caught up with him.
It's ironic.
Today marked his 10th year as a CONTROL agent.
- Send that, Larrabee.
- What's that?
"Happy anniversary".
This is it.
It's not much to go on.
But Forsythe, the British agent who was working with Collins, located the Arab informer.
And from what he was able to learn, we're quite sure that the missile base is located somewhere in that area.
Well, that's great, Chief.
Now all we have to do is to send in some low-level bombers-- No, that won't do it, Max.
The base is underground.
Now, we'll have to send in two agents to do the job, and we've got less than 72 hours left.
The Pentagon has ordered me to hand-pick two people-- two people who can work together as a team, who know how each other will think and react-- two people who will form a perfectly-balanced coordinating team.
- Chief, I know just the team.
- Who?
Huntley and Brinkley.
Max, I need two CONTROL agents.
We could swear them in.
Please, Max, I've made up my mind.
- You and 99 are going.
- Right, Chief.
Now I really hate to hand you this assignment, but I have no other choice.
You're the best working team I've got.
Well, we won't let you down, Chief.
Max, this will undoubtedly be the most dangerous mission you've ever gone on.
You probably won't get back alive.
If you're trying to scare me, Chief, you're wasting your time.
I don't know the meaning of the word fear.
You'll have to parachute from I think I just learned it.
Max, have you ever jumped from a plane?
- Yes, Chief-- once during the war.
- When?
Just before it took off for overseas.
Max, will you and 99 go down to the lab and check out your equipment?
Here's something you can eat in case of an emergency.
- Our uniforms?
- No, the buttons.
Mmm, salted.
Good.
In extreme heat, salt is essential to the diet.
But be sure you don't eat the top button of your uniform, 86.
- Why?
- It's a Geiger counter.
When you come close to where the missiles are buried, it will start beeping.
Oh, the old beeping-button trick.
Well, that's it.
You'd better get started.
Your plane takes off in where Forsythe is.
He was supposed to be here an hour ago.
Max, look.
Is that him?
I hope so.
Forsythe?
Maxwell Smart?
- Yes, and this is Agent 99.
- Hello.
Sorry we're late.
We had some difficulty slipping out of Casablanca last night.
I see.
Who's that?
Oh, this is Hassein.
He'll guide us to the missile base.
Oh, glad to have you along, Hassein.
- Doesn't he understand English?
- Perfectly, but KAOS had his tongue cut out because he was an informer.
I see.
What did he say?
He's telling us we'd better move on.
And I think he's right.
Come on, 99.
All right, all right.
We're coming, Hassein.
No need to holler.
Forsythe, I think we're being followed.
been hit.
Forsythe, where have you been hit?
He's trying to say something, Max.
- He's dead.
- What did he say?
He asked me to get my knee off his chest.
Do you think they're still following us, Max?
Probably, 99.
They're not going to give up until they get every last one of us.
If only they'd come out and show themselves, at least we'd have a chance to fight back.
That's their strategy, Max.
They undermine their enemy and make them more vulnerable.
What we've got to do is keep far enough ahead of them - so that we are out of range.
- Right, Max.
It isn't going to be easy, 99.
This heat is vicious.
We've got to keep going, Max.
- Wait a minute, 99.
- What is it?
- I've got an idea.
- What?
Why don't we sleep during the day and walk at night?
- Oh, Max, there's no time.
- Oh, okay.
How about sleeping during the day and running at night?
Max, there's no time to sleep at all.
- We've got to keep going.
- Right, 99.
- Max, where's your canteen?
Oh, it's in my pack with the rest of my gear.
Well, don't you think you ought to keep your water handy?
Not necessarily, 99.
You see, because of my rugged training I have tremendous endurance.
Why, I am practically impervious to sun, heat and thirst.
I can go miles and miles and miles without touching a drop of water.
- You can?
- I have to.
I forgot to fill my canteen before we left.
Here, use mine.
Oh, no no no, 99.
I wouldn't touch that.
It's a well-known fact that men can stand the heat a lot better than women.
Max, it's the other way around.
It is?
Be careful, Max.
Some of that is getting in your mouth.
Thank you, 99.
You're welcome, Max.
Max, what's happening?
Max, look-- Hassein is waving to us.
He's trying to tell us something.
Come on, 99.
It's getting worse, Max!
We'll never live through it.
99, my throat is scorched.
I can hardly swallow.
I know, Max.
Listen, 99, I know this is a long shot, but I've got to ask you anyway.
What is it, Max?
You don't happen to have a can of cold beer on you, do you?
Max!
Max, where are you?
Right here, 99.
Oh, Max.
You won't believe this, 99, but I'm standing on my toes.
Max.
Max, I don't see Hassein anywhere.
He must have gone off and left us.
Max, we're lost.
We don't know where we are.
I know, 99.
I'm going to take a look over that sand dune.
What is it, Max?
What is it, Max?
It's Hassein.
They buried him up to his neck and put a canteen of water just out of his reach.
Oh, those dirty, evil, rotten, barbaric-- Keep your voice down.
We don't want to get them any madder than they are now.
Max, have you lost your buttons?
I was hungry, 99.
But, Max, why did you eat them all?
Why didn't you save some for later?
Did you ever try to eat just one salted button?
Once you get started, you can't stop.
Max, you didn't eat the top button.
Oh, no, 99, I-- Oh, Max, you ate the Geiger counter!
I thought one tasted a little stale.
Now what are we going to do?
I don't know, 99, but I've got to have another salted button.
I've just got to have one more-- just one more salted button.
No, Max, don't.
to have that button.
Max, if you eat that button, my clothes will-- I don't care, 99.
I've got to have that button.
I'm warning you, Max, if you come one step closer-- that button.
Thank you, 99.
I needed that.
Now, can I please have that button?
Get hold of yourself!
We've got 24 hours to find that missile base and destroy it.
You're right, 99.
Come on.
Let's get moving.
Good thinking, Max.
Keep going, 99.
We've got to keep going.
Oh, go on without me, Max.
I can't go any further.
Of course you can, 99.
You said that an hour ago, and look how far we've come.
- How far have we come?
- About 30 yards.
We're using up all our energy getting up and falling down.
I think we'd do a lot better if we just stayed down here and crawled.
We're not going to make it, Max.
They're going to find us here dead.
Max, look!
Look!
We're saved!
- Where?
Where, 99?
- Out there, straight ahead.
I don't see anything.
Oh, Max, can't you see it?
As clear as day-- an orange juice stand!
- An orange juice stand?
- Yes, I can see it.
Right out there.
Where?
Where, 99?
I don't see anything.
Oh, Max, straight ahead.
No, it's a mirage, You're seeing things.
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive, 99.
One large orange, please.
Max, where are we?
Heaven?
I don't think so.
Then it must be an Arabian Playboy Club.
You are in the humble tent of Ahmad, a simple Bedouin trader.
I see.
How long have we been here?
A mere hour or so.
We found you lost and dying in the desert.
Well, we're certainly indebted to you for saving our lives.
Tell me how it came to be that the two of you were wandering alone in the desert.
Uh, yes, well, you see-- We're on our honeymoon.
In the middle of the Sahara?
Yes well, you see my wife happens to be crazy about the beach.
You are welcome in the camp of Ahmad for as long as you wish to stay.
We will do everything to make your stay enjoyable.
Well, thank you very much, Ahmad.
But I have some very important business to take care of, and I'm afraid it can't wait.
If you must move on, may I suggest you wait until dark and travel in the cool of the night?
Well, thank you very much, Ahmad, but we must be moving on.
- Time is of the essence.
- Ahmad.
If Mr. Smart's business is so urgent, then perhaps it would be rude of us to delay him.
Nonsense, Jamal.
Where is your hospitality?
Our guests will dine with us this evening, and I shall have my daughter Fatima dance for them.
Well, we certainly wouldn't want to offend your generosity.
We'd be most happy to dine with you and leave tonight.
Splendid.
I shall make the arrangements for your departure.
Would you like a camel?
No thanks.
I'm trying to cut down.
Ahmad, why are we being so nice to them?
They are CONTROL agents.
Why do we not cut their throats?
No.
If we kill them, other CONTROL agents will take their place.
But if we overextend ourselves with kindness and hospitality, they will leave here never suspecting that we are KAOS.
But is it not dangerous that they be here?
They are liable to find our missiles.
Hardly.
The missiles are well disguised.
And they could never find the underground entrance as no one is allowed to enter the tent of my daughter's.
Besides, they're not suspicious.
What if they get suspicious?
Then they will die.
Now put your dagger back in your scabbard.
Ahmad What is it?
I do not have a scabbard.
You do now.
We must see to it that Smart and that girl make their way back to civilization and report that there is no KAOS missile base here in the Sahara.
Then when they search the rest of the world, we will be free to unleash our missiles and destroy their cities one by one.
Yes.
First New York, then London, Paris, Rome - Tel Aviv.
- No, not Tel Aviv.
Why not Tel Aviv?
Really?
You don't look it.
What's the matter, my friend?
Not feeling well?
I'm afraid I've had a little too much wine, Ahmad.
I wonder if you would think it was terribly rude of me if I stepped outside for a bit of fresh air.
May Allah go with you.
Oh, thank you, but I'd rather go alone.
Hi.
Now look, fella, I don't want any trouble, but I'm going to search this tent.
Do the words "get out" mean anything to you?
Okay, there's a little saying you may have heard of.
It goes like this-- "The bigger they come, the harder they fall".
Haven't heard of that one, eh?
Okay, here's one you may like-- "The quality of mercy is not strained".
Good.
Move out with the caravan.
We'll join you in a few minutes.
The missile is set to go off in 30 minutes.
New York is the target.
Splendid.
Now the world will know that KAOS keeps their threats.
As for you and the young lady, Mr. Smart, I leave you to the mercy of the unmerciful desert sun.
You'll never get away with this, Ahmad.
Goodbye, Mr. Smart.
I guess this is it, Max.
It's no use, 99.
I can't get these ropes untied.
Max, look-- someone's coming.
Fatima, what are you doing here?
I sneaked away and came back to save you.
But why would you want to save us?
You're Ahmad's daughter.
He lied.
I am not his daughter.
I was his slave.
I have been waiting for the right opportunity to escape.
Then it was you who inscribed the message in the bottom of the goblet.
- Yes.
- Here, cut 99's ropes.
I'm going to the control panel.
Max!
Max!
Well that does it, 99.
That's marvelous, Max.
How did you do it so fast?
Well, I didn't have time to dismantle the missile, so I reset the directional control.
It's set to go off in a few minutes.
- For where?
- Straight up then straight down.
It will wipe out everything-- the control room and the missile.
And us!
Oh, Max, what do we do now?
Run, 99.
Run.
Well, there it goes, 99.
Oh, Max, what a terrible weapon of destruction.
Yes.
You know, China, Russia and France should outlaw all nuclear weapons.
We should insist upon it.
What if they won't, Max?
Then we may have to blast them.
It's the only way to keep peace in the world.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Mr. Smart?
How did you get in here?
I slipped your landlady a dollar and she let me in the back door.
Oh, you should have used the front door, it's only a quarter.
- Who are you?
- I'm a Pussycat.
A Pussycat?
Yes, at Frank Valentine's Pussycat club.
Oh, yes, of course-- the private key club where all the waitresses dress like pussycats.
Mr. Smart, I haven't much time, and what I have to tell you could be very important.
- I'll make a drink.
- I don't need a drink.
I do.
Please, Mr. Smart, I have to get back to the club.
I'm on a break and we're not allowed to leave the premises.
If they find out I've come to see you-- They'll fire you.
- They'll kill me.
- Oh.
That'll make it rather difficult to collect unemployment insurance.
Why don't you take it easy?
Relax, sit down and tell me what's on your mind.
Well, I read in this evening's paper that Dr. Herbert Von Solo the Austrian scientist disappeared.
That's right, Von Solo was here in Washington for some top-secret meetings.
He left his hotel early yesterday and hasn't been seen since.
Von Solo was in the Pussycat Club last night.
He was?
Yes, I waited on him myself.
I brought him a cocktail, and when I returned he was gone.
Hm, that's strange.
Von Solo was one of the world's most highly-respected scientists.
He's a winner of the Nobel Prize.
- It just doesn't make sense.
- What doesn't make sense?
That he would sneak out without paying his check.
Mr. Smart, he didn't sneak out.
- I'm convinced he was taken out.
- What makes you think that?
Because of certain things that have been going on in the club-- strange things.
What kind of strange things?
-  - Look, I've gotta get back to the club.
I'll talk to you later, all right?
Are you sure I can't fix you a drink?
Oh no, it's against the rules-- Pussycats aren't allowed to drink liquor.
Oh, how about a saucer of milk?
No, I must go.
Wait a minute, Pussycat.
Be very careful when you pass apartment 1C.
Why?
- They have a bulldog.
- Okay, I'll see you later.
Hello, Chief?
Max.
What's up, Max?
Chief, Dr. Herbert Von Solo did not disappear.
He was kidnapped.
Kidnapped?
How do you know that?
A pussycat told me.
Don't you by chance mean a little birdie?
No, I don't, Chief.
I mean a Pussycat.
Max, get some sleep.
Chief, a girl who works at the Pussycat club was just here in my apartment.
She claims that Von Solo was in there last night.
No, Chief, she didn't give me her name or address.
Max, if what you say is true, then this could be extremely important.
Can you at least describe her?
Let's see now, Chief.
She was a brunette, and uh, large brown eyes, small upturned nose, ripe sensuous lips, slender but voluptuous body and long shapely legs.
You've got to get hold of this girl right away!
You bet your sweet life I do.
- Max, get over to-- -  - Hold on, Chief.
-  Max, what happened?
Max?
!
Chief, I just stuck my head out the window and saw two men push that Pussycat into a car - and drive away.
- What was that crash I heard?
I forgot to open the window.
Find out anything, Chief?
Yes, her name is Pamela Courtney.
She's an actress.
She took the job at the Pussycat Club so she could meet people - who might further her career.
- Oh, that's too bad.
I thought that girl could go right to the top.
Why do you say that, Max?
notice that she had that certain indefinable something that makes a star.
You were only with her for five minutes.
When did you find that out?
When she took off her coat.
Max, we're indebted to that girl.
She opened up our eyes to something that we should've realized right along.
What's that, Chief?
There are Pussycat Clubs located in London, Paris and Washington.
In the past few months, four of the free world's top scientists have disappeared - from those very same cities.
- You're kidding!
I never kid.
I have the information right there-- one disappeared from London, one from Paris and two from right here in Washington.
Know what that means?
Of course-- Washington is in the lead.
Max, I wouldn't exactly be proud of that.
Well, it is my hometown, Chief.
Couldn't this be some kind of coincidence, Chief?
I don't think so.
Believe me, 99, this is definitely no coincidence.
- What makes you say that, Max?
- What makes me say that, Chief?
We've discovered that every one of those scientists visited the Pussycat Club on the night he disappeared.
That's what makes me say that.
Why would brilliant, intelligent men want to go to a place like that?
Well, there are several reasons, 99.
Men like that need a place to unwind-- a change of atmosphere, a change of scene.
But Max, there's nothing to do there except look at a lot of girls walking around half undressed.
Say, that's the best reason yet.
Chief, do you think that Frank Valentine-- the owner of the Pussycat Club-- is working for KAOS?
That's my hunch, 99, but I need proof.
We have to catch Valentine actually in the act - of kidnapping a scientist.
- Chief, I wanna get involved in this case!
- Sorry about that, Chief.
- Stop!
As I was saying, Chief, I wanna be involved in this case.
Max, I want you to pose as a scientist.
That involved I don't wanna be.
on this assignment.
You'll pose as a German husband-and-wife scientist team-- Drs.
Fritz and Greta Braun.
Is KAOS after them, Chief?
- They will be.
- What do you mean?
We have a top secret laboratory in Heidelberg engaged in germicidal warfare research.
KAOS has tried unsuccessfully to infiltrate it.
I'll let it slip out that the program is headed up by Drs.
Fritz and Greta Braun.
Oh, I get it, Chief.
Then they'll wanna kidnap us and torture us to find out everything we know.
Since we don't know anything, there's nothing we can tell them.
Right, so they'll be forced to kill us!
Uh, you got any other assignments, Chief?
- No.
- You mean to tell me, Chief, - that we're in this thing alone?
- No, Max, we've assigned Agent Charlie Watkins of CONTROL West on this case.
- Oh, good.
Watkins is a good man.
- Watkins?
Isn't he the disguise expert who makes himself up to look like a beautiful girl?
That's right, 99.
Here's his picture.
That's a fantastic disguise.
Uh, what's he posing as on this case, Chief?
We got him a job as a Pussycat in the Washington club.
- He'll be your contact.
- I can't wait to see her-- uh, him.
Here are your instructions-- you'll leave immediately onboard a special plane for Germany.
A car will pick you up at the airport, take you to a back road where you'll switch cars, drive back to the airport and take a jet immediately back to Washington.
- Have you got it?
- Not all of it, Chief.
What part didn't you get?
The part after we leave immediately.
I'll write it down.
- Good idea.
- Chief, what happens after we arrive back in Washington tomorrow?
We'll check you in to a suite at the Peer Gynt Hotel, then you'll wait for Frank Valentine to call - and invite you to the Pussycat Club.
- Right, Chief.
Now I want you to memorize these.
Your lives may depend upon it.
- What are they, Chief?
- They're your biographies.
They tell where you were born and went to school.
I know where I was born and where I went to school.
Not you, Max-- Fritz Braun.
do you speak German?
Oh, fluently, Chief.
Max, how's your German?
Max!
Where did you learn to speak German like that?
From watching old movies on television.
That was from "All Quiet on the Western Front," Chief.
- One of my favorites.
- I'll remember that.
- Lew Ayres was in it.
- You'd better be on your way.
And Louis Wolheim with a big helmet was-- Chief: Max!
Don't forget, this is a most hazardous assignment.
The second you set foot in Germany, you'll be living in constant extreme danger.
Und damit gefreut.
What's he saying now, 99?
And Ioving it.
Doctor, could we get a picture, please?
Yeah.
Could we get one of you seated on your suitcase - with your legs crossed?
- Yeah, I would be most happy.
I meant your wife.
Oh, of course.
Doctor, what, in your opinion, do you think is the answer to world peace?
- Cameras.
- Cameras?
Yeah, cameras.
People should shoot pictures, not guns.
"People should shoot pictures, not guns".
That's a very profound thought, Doctor.
Yeah.
This thought was given to me by an old friend in Heidelberg.
- Is he a colleague of yours?
- No, he owns a camera shop.
Doctor, what have you been working on in your laboratories in Germany?
Ah, that is a good question.
We have been working on two of the most important things for the preservation of human life-- - Food und water.
- "Food and water".
"Und.
Und," dummkopf.
"Und water".
Und how to contaminate them through germ warfare.
You will have to excuse us, but we have had a very tiring flight.
Und such a lousy movie.
I guess I know everything there is to know about Greta Braun.
- How are you doing, Max?
- Fine.
We've been married for 11 years and we don't have any children.
- Good.
- Why is that good, Max?
At least we don't have to hire a babysitter.
I wonder why we don't have any children, Max?
stop questioning the biography?
And stop calling me "Max"!
From here on in we have to look and act and think like Fritz and Greta Braun all the time.
Oh, ja, good good.
Meine Fritz, liebchen.
- What are you doing?
- My biography says that Greta absolutely adored her husband.
Yes?
Well, my biography says that Dr. Fritz Braun was a dedicated scientist.
He thought of nothing but his work No wonder we don't have any children.
Hello?
Oh, ja, this is Dr. Braun.
Who is this, please?
This is Hans Frome at the German Embassy, Doctor.
We wish to welcome you and Mrs. Braun to Washington.
Ah, that is very kind of you.
Look, uh, why don't I stop by the hotel, introduce myself and take you and Mrs. Braun to dinner?
Ah, yeah, that would be very nice.
- In an hour?
- Uh, yeah, we will be ready.
- Auf wiedersehen.
- Auf wiedersehen.
I'm to pick them up in an hour.
Excellent!
But before you bring them here, engage them in conversation-- question them discreetly.
Make sure they are who they say they are.
And if they are not?
!
Kill them instantly.
It's a pleasure to know you both.
Danke schoen.
Perhaps, you would like a little "schnips".
- Schnapps.
- A "schnip" of schnapps?
I'll wait till we get to the club.
- The club?
- Yes.
I thought on your first visit to Washington you would enjoy someplace unusual and attractive, so I took the liberty of making reservations at the Pussycat Club.
Oh, ja, well, uh shall we get started?
Ja, why don't we get started?
We don't want to keep the little Pussycats waiting, huh?
Come on.
Our reservations aren't for an hour yet.
Let us sit and talk.
There are so many things I want to ask you about home.
Yeah, home.
Home, "schweet" home.
And you are from Cologne?
Correct.
Did you attend the University of Cologne?
- Did you?
- No.
Then I did.
Meine husband is modest about his education.
He likes to make jokes.
But he was an exceptional student.
This is so.
I got all A's.
That's very unusual.
They don't give A's in Germany.
I know, I got the last ones.
Well, let's go see the Pussycats.
In a minute.
Tell me, Dr. Braun, did you perhaps know a Professor Heinstock in Cologne?
- Ah-ha-ha, Heinstock!
-  Of course.
Who didn't know - old Professor Heinstock-- - Fritz never met him.
- --besides me?
- I studied with Professor Heinstock at the University of Frankfurt.
He has never taught in Cologne.
Oh yes, of course.
How stupid of me.
I think perhaps we should be on our way.
Oh, thank you.
It is a lovely place, Mr. Frome.
I thought you'd enjoy it, Mrs. Braun.
If you'll excuse me, I'll see if I can find Mr. Valentine, the owner.
I know he'd be honored to meet you.
What do you think, Max?
For a guy from the German Embassy who was just trying to be nice to us, - he certainly is nosy.
- I thought so too.
contact the Chief - and check out this Frome.
- But how can we, Max?
If we make a telephone call, he's gonna get suspicious.
Hmm I've got it-- Watkins.
We'll get ahold of Watkins and let him do it.
Good thinking.
But, Max, all the Pussycats look alike in those outfits.
How are we gonna know which one is Charlie Watkins?
It's really quite simple, 99.
All we have to do is look over all the Pussycats and the one with the most voluptuous figure, he's our man.
- Well?
- They are here.
They checked out?
He's a bit eccentric, but she is convincing.
I believe they are our people.
Mmm good!
Prepare two special cocktails and put enough tranquilizer in them to make sure the Brauns are cooperative until they're safely aboard the freighter.
Frome: Miss Heilman, Dr. Von Solo and now the Brauns.
That makes four-- we have finally fulfilled our quota for shipment to Peking.
You, take these two cocktails over to table seven and be quick about it.
I'll radio the freighter and have them send a launch - to meet us at the dock.
- Good.
Is that for table seven, honey?
I'll take it.
It's almost time for your break.
Good evening, I'm your Pussycat.
What's new, Pussycat?
I make a little joke--   Hello, 86.
- Is that you, Watkins?
- Uh-huh.
This is Agent 99.
- 99, this is Charlie Watkins.
- Hello, Charlie.
Hi, there.
Better not use your own voice, Charlie.
Someone might hear you.
Right, 86.
Well good luck.
Yes, we're gonna need it.
Anything to report, Watkins?
I've turned this place inside out to find a secret passageway for them - to smuggle out their victims.
- Did you find it?
- Finally.
- Where is it?
There's a back door in the kitchen that leads to the alley.
The old back-door-to- the-alley trick.
What will they think of next?
We're up against a tough lot this time, Smart.
We'd better move fast.
Here's what I want you to do, Watkins.
Contact the Chief and have him run an immediate check on Hans Frome of the German Embassy here in Washington.
Right away.
You know something, 99?
With Pussycats like these, I don't know why anyone would wanna own a dog.
We'll be waiting for you at the dock.
Be there on time.
It's all arranged-- you get the Brauns, I'll have the car meet us in the alley.
Right.
The tranquilizer should have worked by now.
Valentine!
The Chief checked Frome out.
There was no such person connected with the German Embassy.
He-- Smart?
Oh, no.
Hurry, get the Brauns.
How much do you think she knows?
It doesn't matter, she won't live to talk.
Get in there.
If I get in there, I'll die!
You'll die faster if you don't get in.
Move!
Here they are, and most cooperative.
Excellent!
Now all we have to do is deliver them aboard the freighter Red Star where Heilman and Von Solo are waiting.
We could set sail for Peking immediately!
Escort them to the alley where the car is waiting.
Get in.
And now you, Doctor.
All right, don't anybody move!
Stay right where you are.
- So you didn't drink your cocktail.
- No, I did not.
Who are you?
Perhaps this will help.
I've never seen you before in my life.
You haven't?
How about you?
Well, I just happen to be Maxwell Smart.
Secret Agent 86?
So a CONTROL agent?
Yes, and this is the end of your little kidnapping operation, Mr. Valentine.
Smart!
Stop him, Frome!
Take your hands off the ignition, Smart.
- Max, are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine, Chief.
- Good shooting.
- How's 99?
Oh, she's fine, Chief.
They just drugged our drinks.
How come you're not drugged?
Well, I remember reading in the biography that Dr. Braun was a teetotaler, so I made sure not to touch that drink.
- That was very wise, Max.
- Thank you, Chief.
Incidentally, how did you know we were here?
Valentine locked Watkins in the freezer; Watkins found the hidden radio and contacted us on it.
Good old Charlie.
Uh, well, Chief, I guess I deserve a little congratulations for this.
Yes, Max, you did a fine job.
- Fine job?
- Yes.
You could be a little more enthusiastic than that, Chief.
After all, I'm a hero.
I deserve a medal for this.
A medal?
Yes, don't you realize what I've done?
I've made the world safe for German scientists.
- Are you all right, 99?
- Much better, Max, thanks.
Good.
How about you, Charlie?
How are you feeling?
- Still thawing out.
- Good boy.
Wonderful, Commander.
Thank you.
That was Commander Nye of the Coast Guard, Max.
He boarded the Red Star and rescued Professor Heilman and Dr. Von Solo.
Oh, that's great, Chief.
Did they ever get that Pussycat who was kidnapped from my apartment?
Yes, they got her too.
- Oh, good.
How is she?
- She's in fine shape, Max.
I know that, Chief.
But how is she?
- Fine, Max.
- Good.
Well, you've done a great job.
I'm gonna take you to dinner, and afterwards maybe we'll go dancing.
Knock it off, Smart.
I take enough ribbing.
I wasn't talking to you, Charlie.
I was talking to 99.
Of course, if you'd like to tag along, it's all right with me.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Put up your hands.
That's an interesting device you've got there-- first a ladder, then a rope.
- What else does it do?
- Oh, well, I'm glad you asked.
You see, it's a flashlight, a camera-- Hand it over.
-  - It's also a parachute.
- Chief: Yes, I will, sir.
-  We're all here, so we might as well get started.
What I'm about to tell you must not leave this room.
It's top security.
Top security?
That calls for the Cone of Silence, Chief.
Max, how do you expect to get five people into something that small?
Thinking like that would have put the Volkswagen people out of business a long time ago.
- Max!
- Sorry, Chief, but the manual calls for the Cone of Silence.
Anytime a situation like this arises, you must follow the manual.
All right, Max, lower it, lower it, lower it!
Take this chair away.
Okay, 99, you get around there with the Chief.
You get in here with me.
No, 99, get in front of the Chief a little bit.
That's it.
Okay, beautiful, beautiful.
Very good.
That's perfect.
See, Chief?
I told you it could be done.
Look at that.
There's room for one more man.
Come on.
- Okay, Chief, go ahead.
- Dr. Waldo Smith-- - What?
- Dr. Waldo Smith of our PLK Lab, the man who invented the stolen formula 6076767.
- What's the number?
- 6076-- never mind.
It's a false number used to protect the identity of the real number.
What's the purpose of this formula, Chief?
I'm sorry, 99, I can't hear you.
That's my bad ear.
Oh, do you mind?
I said, "What is the purpose of the formula, Chief"?
You don't have to yell now, 99.
That's my good ear.
- What?
- That's my good ear.
I'm sorry, Chief.
What is the purpose of the formula?
We don't know, but if it falls into the hands of KAOS, there is no hope for our country.
Chief, is there any evidence as to who might have stolen it?
- What?
- I asked is there any evidence-- Hold-- hold it a minute, fella.
Why don't you get around to the front of the cone?
Excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I asked, Do you have any leads?
- We have been approached.
- By whom?
What?
Would you mind stepping to the rear of the cone?
That's much better.
Now who approached you, Chief?
We don't know who it was.
It was a call from an informer.
He said he'd call back.
- When?
- What?
Not what.
When.
- When what?
- Listen, Chief, can we get out of this stupid cone?
We can't hear each other.
What, Max?
That's all for now.
Ashkenazi, Crilleader, return to your posts.
- Right, sir.
- Yes, sir.
- Who are they, Chief?
- Well-- forget it!
Well, Chief, I guess there's nothing left for us to do but to stay here and wait for that phone call.
Excuse me, 99.
Hello?
It's Dr. Smith.
Hold on, Dr. Smith, we'll put you on the screen.
Max: The professor sure took a beating when KAOS stole the formula.
Hello, Dr. Smith, how are you feeling?
Fine, except for this brain concussion.
Any news from our informer?
Not yet.
Dr. Smith, could you describe the capabilities of your formula?
Oh, yes, certainly.
It's a catalytic agent that turns water into vapor.
Uh, pardon me.
One drop of it is powerful enough to dry up a body of water the size of Lake Erie in less than an hour.
We have some photographic evidence here Yes, that might prove illuminating.
Finletter, my assistant, was on this boat.
He was attacked by KAOS agents, and in order to escape them he dove overboard, forgetting he had an ounce of the formula in his pocket.
This is the same body of water after he landed in it.
Poor Finletter.
He's the only man who ever drowned in dirt.
If KAOS does control this formula, in a matter of days every American will die of thirst and starvation.
Pardon me.
Is our connection getting fuzzy?
No.
Then I'm going to faint.
Dr. Smith!
Dr. Smith!
Chief, contact's been made on my phone.
The informant wants to make an arrangement.
- He's gonna call back in five minutes.
- Thank you, Crilleader.
- At last.
- Who's assigned to this case, Chief?
Let's see who's number's up.
- Is Agent 84 out there?
- Man: Not here.
Not here either.
Agent 86?
That's me, Chief.
Man: Melvin Spearman, paging Mr. Melvin Spearman.
Boy, I'm Mr. Spearman.
Phone for you, sir.
Right this way.
- Hello, Chief.
- How'd you know it was me, Max?
Well, you see, Chief, you're the only one that I gave the cover name Melvin Spearman to.
You're using more than one pseudonym on this case?
That's right, Chief.
You see, that way, if I get a call and I'm not able to answer it, at least I know who to call back.
Seems to make sense, and that worries me.
- Have you made contact yet, Max?
- No, I haven't, Chief.
Our man certainly picked an odd place to hold a meeting.
There's a big awards luncheon here and the place is full of celebrities.
Milton Steeple, paging Mr. Milton Steeple.
- Hold on a minute, Chief.
- Milton-- - I'll take that.
- But it's not for you, Mr. Spearman, - it's for Mr. Milton Steeple.
- I'm Milton Steeple.
- You're Mr. Steeple, Mr. Spearman?
- Yes.
Steeple is my maiden name.
Here's another half-dollar.
Hello, 99?
Hello, Max.
I'm at the CONTROL Savings & Loan Bank.
How much money do you need?
Well, I haven't made contact yet.
You can only withdraw $25,000, Max.
Only $25,000?
Why?
There's a new ceiling on bribes.
That's ridiculous!
Did you tell them it could mean the end of the United States?
How do you think I got them up to $25,000?
Hold on, 99.
Hello, Chief?
99 tells me that the top price they'll pay for information is $25,000.
That's right, Max.
We're trying to cooperate with the President, fight inflation.
But Chief, $25,000 is no kind of money to pay for information.
Maxwell Smart!
Paging Maxwell Smart!
- 86, aren't they paging Maxwell Smart?
- Yes, Chief.
- Aren't you going to answer it?
- No, sir.
Why not?
I'm not using the name Maxwell Smart on this case.
Max, that could be the contact.
- Paging Maxwell Smart!
- I'm Maxwell Smart.
You're Maxwell Smart too?
Well, you should have told me sooner.
We've got a special today-- three for $1.
That phone.
- Hello?
- Smart?
- Who is this?
- I've got the information you want.
I think it's time we met and talked.
Hold on.
- Chief?
- No, Max, this is 99.
- How much do you want?
- I don't know yet.
Hold on.
- Hello, Chief?
- No, Max, this is 99.
Hold on.
Hello, Chief, he wants to make a deal.
- Ask him how much.
- Right.
How much do you want?
Max, that's what I asked you.
Sorry, wrong number.
- How much do you want?
- What's your top?
$25,000.
- Honestly?
- Have I ever lied to you?
All right.
Meet me at precisely 4:00 in the revolving door of the hotel.
In the revolving door?
That way you're always in front of me.
Yes, hold on.
Hello, Chief, $25,000 is okay.
I'm to meet him in the revolving door at this hotel, 4:00.
will back you up.
Tell her to meet me under the lobby clock.
Right, Chief.
Hello?
You're to meet the Chief under the lobby clock.
What did you say?
Max: Sorry, sir, I'll connect you.
Hello, 99, meet the chief at the hotel under the clock.
Right, Max.
Hello, it's a deal.
- 4:00, in the revolving door.
- 4:00.
Everything's set.
Goodbye, Chief.
So long, 99.
Goodbye, whoever you are.
Siegelman!
Paging Miss Mildred Siegelman!
Mildred Siegelman?
I don't think so, but I'd better take it just in case.
Hello, this is Mildred.
Don't turn around, Mr. Smart.
Well, you certainly took your sweet time about getting here.
I had to be careful.
I thought I was being followed.
- You have the money?
- You have the information?
Not until I get the money.
First the information.
- The money!
- The information.
All right, we can keep going around in circles like this all night long.
Maybe you can, but I've got just about one more trip left in me before-- I think that was it.
All right, I'll trust you.
The formula was stolen by--  Right over there on the couch, Max.
I'm in pain.
Don't exert yourself.
- 99, get the house doctor, will you?
- Right away, Chief.
Max, do you have any idea who this is?
I've seen that face somewhere before, Chief.
I've got it!
That's Russell Bediyoskin, the famous movie actor.
He plays character parts.
- Are you sure?
- I'm in pain.
Are you Russell Bediyoskin?
Help, I'm-- you recognized me.
Are you kidding?
You're one of my favorite actors.
I'll never forget your great dying scene in "The Edge of Darkness".
I-- I'm very good at dying.
In my new picture I do a dying scene you won't believe.
Authentic.
I never knew how authentic.
You'll never top "Edge of Darkness".
Max, forget the movies.
Ask him.
- Ask him what?
- You know what.
Ask him.
Chief, I can't ask a man for his autograph at a time like this.
That's all right.
Have you got a pen?
Mr. Bediyoskin, we just want to know-- who was it that stole the formula?
- What?
-  - What'd he say?
- He wants to be turned around.
- This is his good side.
- Man: Chief, KAOS is on TV!
Man: And if we do not receive $1 billion-- I repeat, $1 billion-- within 48 hours, we will unleash the terrifying power of Formula 6076767.
Your country will be turned into a wasteland.
Remember, friends, now only KAOS has Formula 6076767, known to scientists around the world by the trade name "Dry Up".
D-R-Y-U-P!
A product now of KAOS, Incorporated.
That's not a bad little show.
Oughta be on earlier for the kiddies.
What do you make of this, Max?
Do you think they're bluffing?
Pardon me, sir.
Your vest button is flashing.
Get lost, fella.
I hate drunks.
What are you, some kind of a bigot?
- What's with your vest?
- It's my shoe phone, Chief.
I had a light installed instead of a ring.
It's less conspicuous.
It certainly is.
Yes, sir.
Yes, he is, sir.
Just a moment, sir.
- What'd you just do?
- I put the call on hold.
It's for you, Chief.
It's him.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir, we saw the telecast.
Yes, in color.
Yes, it was very pretty.
No, sir, we haven't been idle.
We have a witness.
Unfortunately, he's been shot and we have to rush him to a hospital.
Don't worry, sir, we'll get that formula back, even if it means our lives.
Yes, sir.
He's calling an emergency session of all our top security officials.
What did he say, Chief, when you told him we'd get the formula back even if it meant our lives?
He said we'd have to do better than that.
Here's the doctor now.
Doctor?
Yes, I'm the hotel doctor.
You sent for me?
- Yes, right this way, Doctor.
- All right.
- Is this the patient?
- Yes, he is.
Chief: He's been shot.
I'm the doctor, I'll make the diagnosis.
Please hurry up.
This is a government emergency.
How does Bediyoskin fit into all this?
Why does a man of his reputation need money so desperately?
Man: I can answer that.
And just who are you?
I am Otto Hurrah.
The same Otto Hurrah who made "Edge of Morning"?
The same, the only, the original.
I'm glad you liked the picture.
You did like the picture?
I liked it so much, I saw it once.
Mr. Hurrah, do you know Russell Bediyoskin?
- Do I know Russell Bediyoskin?
- Yes.
It's unfortunate.
He's my friend-- my friend who gambled away his home, his wife and now perhaps his life.
Please, I would like to help.
If he needs anything-- money, blood, publicity What kind of gambler is Bediyoskin?
A losing one.
It doesn't matter-- horses, dice, cards-- he loses.
He's always on the edge of ruin.
Edge of ruin Not a bad title.
I love it.
Chief, the hotel doctor is coming right down.
He's here already, 99.
That's not the hotel doctor.
- Are you sure?
- I'm absolutely positive.
The hotel doctor is a woman.
I just spoke to her.
A hypodermic needle?
Good work, Max.
Is he dead?
I think so, Chief.
Unless the stuff in that hypodermic needle is penicillin, and I don't think it is.
Whatever he was going to inject Bediyoskin with, it would have killed him instantly.
This is terrible!
One man killed and another man wounded.
Where are the police?
Well, we called them before, but the line was busy.
Well, if you have no further need for me, I will be on my way.
Otto Hurrah will say goodbye.
Goodbye.
Chief, we've got to get Bediyoskin out of here right away.
Right.
If we don't, KAOS will kill him before we can get him into protective custody at the hospital.
But we'd better use our own ambulance-- disguised, of course.
What's available to us, 99?
Well, we have one ambulance disguised as a flower truck, and another disguised as a bakery truck.
No good.
We can't have them speeding without attracting attention.
Max: Wait a minute, Chief.
Don't we have an ambulance disguised as a garbage truck?
How can you explain a garbage truck going 80 miles an hour in traffic?
Special delivery?
We have an ambulance disguised as an ambulance.
We'll use the bakery truck.
We'll have to get him out the back way.
I don't think we should lift him.
We'd better carry him out on the couch.
Men Larrabee, clear the lobby.
Careful.
Now we'll have to find somebody to substitute for Bediyoskin in the regular ambulance.
Yes, and we're gonna need another couch too, Chief.
Chief, whoever goes in that ambulance is on a suicide mission.
I know, 99, but we've got to have a decoy.
Who have you got in mind, Chief?
Both: You, Max.
Good luck, Max.
Chief, what's wrong?
Nothing, 99.
It's just not easy sending men out on missions knowing they may never come back.
Last week, two assignments, two agents killed-- Balzac and Nicholson.
I feel like a jinx.
Oh, Chief, you're just having bad luck.
He's having better luck than Balzac and Nicholson.
Chief: Over here, men.
Now be gentle with him.
He's got a bullet lodged in his ribcage.
- Move the coffee table.
-  Be careful.
Gentlemen.
What hospital are you taking him to?
Washington General.
So far so good.
Now we've got to take care of Bediyoskin.
Right, Chief.
Got your silencer on?
Okay, let him have it.
Hold it.
It's a cop.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Hold it, it's a cop.
Hello?
Hello?
- Hello, Chief.
- How are you feeling, Max?
Much better, thank you.
Anything new from Bediyoskin?
He's safe at the hospital but he's still unconscious.
- We got the men who tried to kill you.
- Oh, good.
Did they talk?
They didn't know anything.
They weren't regular KAOS personnel, they were hired from an agency-- "Part-Time Killers".
Hello?
Whew!
- Hello?
- What are you looking for, Chief?
Internal Security keeps meddling with the equipment.
Why do they have to change my phone into something different every day?
Well, you can't be too careful in times like these, Chief.
Look, why don't you just call down and ask the fellows in Internal Security where the phone is?
Call them on what, Max?
Right, Chief.
I've been over the whole room and I can't find it.
- Did you look in the clock?
- Don't be ridiculous, Max.
- It wouldn't be in the clock.
-  - So that's where it is.
- Where, Chief?
In the clock, Max.
Hello?
Speaking.
Oh.
Yes, Mr. President.
No, sir, not yet, but we're still trying.
Yes, sir, I know, but if I had a little bit more time, I-- Yes, sir.
Yes, I understand, sir.
Goodbye.
What did he say, Chief?
I'm being temporarily replaced as Chief.
- What?
!
- The president is afraid that people would panic.
He thinks it would be wise to appoint a man with more experience, more imagination, more daring, more wisdom.
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it!
After all your years of courageous and dedicated service, - this is an outrage!
- Well, thank you, Max.
- And one more thing, Chief.
- What?
Would you recommend me for the job?
He's recalling Admiral Hargrade to active duty.
Admiral Hargrade?
Who's he?
He was CONTROL's first Chief.
There's a card on him in the files.
"Admiral Harold Hargrade: in espionage business for over 65 years; started out with his own company, Harold Hargrade & Sons, Spies; entered government service 1909, became Chief of CONTROL and retired in 1946.
Hobbies: chess and burying old buddies.
Now 91 years of age".
and he's still active?
!
Yes, I understand he gets up every morning and takes a two-hour walk to his office.
Where's his office?
Right across the street from his house.
-  - That's the secret entrance.
- It must be the admiral.
- How do you know?
He's the only one that knows about it.
Glad to have you aboard, sir.
Oh, you'll have to speak up, Thaddeus.
My hearing's not what it used to be.
All my other senses are fine, though.
Oh, good afternoon, madam.
- I'll help you down, sir.
- Thank you.
Oops-a-daisy.
I'd like to have you meet Agent 86, - Maxwell Smart.
- How do you do, sir?
- Oh, I've heard about you.
- Thank you, sir.
No one else available, huh?
Well, I'm sorry about my taking over, Thaddeus.
Well, it's good to serve under you again, sir.
- Any new developments?
- Oh, yes.
We think that we've located the KAOS broadcasting station.
Do you have an Area-3 map?
- Yes, sir, we do.
- Oh, good.
- And a pointer?
- Oh, yes, sir.
- Here you are.
- Thank you.
Now, ahem, we think that-- Don't you have a longer pointer than this?
Yes, sir.
Here.
Oh, fine.
Thank you all the same.
Now, ahem, our tracking unit tells us the radio station is approximately in this area.
Uh-oh.
Lists a little to starboard, doesn't it?
Uh, Admiral, why don't you just come over here and sit down and take it easy in the Chief's chair?
Oh, thank you.
I'll do that.
Would somebody give me a little push?
Yes, sir.
- Thank you.
- Chief: Admiral, what was the president's decision on the ransom?
Oh, well, I talked to Herbert about that just a few minutes ago.
Herbert?
Sir, Herbert Hoover is no longer president.
Too bad, I thought he showed a lot of promise.
Anyway, whoever it was authorized me to pay KAOS $1 billion that they have demanded.
But, sir, KAOS will never turn over the formula to us.
They'll just take our money and then sell the formula to our enemies.
Hey, that's right.
Hey, you're a pretty good thinker, boy and a good catcher too.
- Thanks, boy.
- Chief: Admiral, I have to agree with Agent 86-- we cannot pay the money.
Well, exactly how dangerous is this formula?
Well, sir, within 24 hours it could dry up every lake, river and stream in the United States.
We'd be at the mercy of any country that had water.
Bootlegging would come back.
People would start making bathtub water.
Well, we'd better try to solve this case before the KAOS deadline.
Hmm I have a plan.
Thank you.
Sir, you were discussing some sort of plan.
Well, this actor fellow, Bediyoskin, is the key to the plan.
We've got to get him to talk somehow.
What is his condition at this moment?
I was about to call the hospital when you came in.
Well, then proceed.
Full steam ahead.
Ding-ding.
- Hello?
- Hello, Max.
- I think we're onto something.
- What did you find out, 99?
Well, I was going through Bediyoskin's clothes and I found something that puzzles me.
In the pocket of one of his jackets - I found six laundry tickets.
- So what?
Max, why wouldn't he use the hotel laundry?
This laundry is a good two miles from here.
Hmm, you're right, that is strange.
- And another thing, Max-- -  Oh, hold on a minute.
Chief, something happened.
It may be a matter of life and death.
Hurry, Max.
We'll go in my car.
By your leave, Admiral.
It's locked.
We're gonna have to break it down.
We can't do that, Chief.
We'll have everybody on the floor out here.
We don't want to attract attention.
Okay.
She's gone, Chief.
She must have discovered something that KAOS didn't want divulged.
Maybe she left a clue behind.
She's been working with me a long time.
She must have picked up something.
Chief!
Look at this.
I know that face.
Max, it's Bediyoskin.
I know that's Bediyoskin, Chief, but I mean I've seen that face somewhere else on somebody else.
But where?
-  - What?
!
The room is-- Chief, are you sure the room is bugged?
Yes, but I have a plan.
This is our chance to save 99.
- Gotcha, Chief.
Great plan.
- You haven't heard it yet.
I know, Chief, but I've got a lot of confidence in you.
KAOS knows that either one of us can lead them to Bediyoskin.
Now we go back in there and let them overhear that one of us is going to him.
KAOS captures the one who goes and the other follows.
- One of us goes, one of us follows.
- Right.
And one of us already knows who goes and who follows.
- You go.
- Now both of us know.
Pardon me, can you tell me how to get to 1235 Alcazar Street?
- I'm sorry, but I don't know.
- Then I'll show you.
Let's go, Mr. Smart.
We're going to switch cars in case we're being followed.
You're heavily guarded.
Don't try to escape or you'll be shot.
Get in.
Very clever.
You kept 99 right here at the hotel in the very next room to Bediyoskin's.
Let's go.
Hold it.
We'll take your gun.
Just act as if nothing happened.
Good work, Chief.
I knew they couldn't lose you no matter how many times they switched cars.
No, Max, you can't do that.
Whoever's in there might kill 99.
Oh, you're right, Chief.
Open up, it's me.
- It was a clever way of getting in.
- Yes.
You see, Chief, "me" is always someone everybody knows.
- Are you all right, 99?
-  Oh.
Quick, untie me, Max.
Uh, have you got a knife?
There's one in my pocketbook.
Uh, which one is the knife-- the comb, the compact or the mirror?
- The knife, Max.
- The knife?
!
That's clever.
There's nothing in his pockets but this laundry ticket.
- Is it Three Brothers Omniwash?
- Yes.
There were six of those in Bediyoskin's pockets.
- 99, you follow this up.
- Right, Chief.
Max, I've got to get back to CONTROL.
You bring him in.
Right, Chief.
Seven hours have gone by, America, and we have yet to hear from your government.
Therefore, we deem it necessary to start demonstrating the horrible power of formula 6076767.
First, we'll dry up small bodies of water to prove the power of the formula.
Then, unless our demands are met in the next 41 hours, we will proceed to dry up America's most essential bodies of water-- the Mississippi River, the Colorado River and all the Great Lakes.
This is Mark Danderfield speaking for KAOS, Incorporated, a Delaware corporation.
A Delaware corporation?
!
Tax purposes.
Max, we've got to move fast.
- What did you learn about our prisoner?
- Name's Henry Frack.
- Henry what?
-  Frack!
Has nothing to do with KAOS.
Chief, I checked out the laundry.
It seems legitimate enough, but I'm still keeping it - under close surveillance.
- Nothing but dead ends.
Well, 99, this is Admiral Hargrade who's now in charge.
- How do you do?
-  It's still the clock, Max.
Hello, Maxwell Smart here.
What?
!
You're kidding!
Hold on.
Chief, KAOS has just struck and struck hard.
They've dried up Florida's two largest bodies of water-- Lake Okeechobee and the swimming pool at the Fontainebleau Hotel.
Hello, anything else?
I see.
Thank you.
Admiral, the whole country is in a panic.
The network says the switchboard is swamped.
We've gotta do something and do it fast.
Well, our chances are slim-- hopeless.
We are facing imminent disaster.
I must go on the air - and speak to the public.
- What are you gonna tell them?
That everything is fine.
I'd better go on and call the president right away and ask him to go on the air with me and reassure the nation.
Would somebody give me a little push?
Thank you, my dear.
Chief: Thanks, Larrabee.
- What is it, 99?
- They're bulletins, Chief.
"People all over the country have started hoarding water".
"Water prices are skyrocketing.
The Governor of California just put a 10¢ tax on water".
"Mexico has offered us all the water we need".
Tell them, "Thanks anyway".
Our only hope seems to be Russell Bediyoskin, and yet if he regains consciousness, we have no assurance he'll talk.
How odd it is that the destiny of our country should be in the hands of an actor.
Who would ever have thought that could happen?
You know, I don't even know what this man looks like.
Is he a well-known actor?
Well, if you saw his face, you'd know him.
Uh, I have a picture of him, Admiral.
Oh, you must be quite a fan to carry around - a photograph this large.
- No, sir.
See, it's just-- wait a minute, this man looks like - Dr. Waldo Smith.
- I'm afraid you're mistaken.
Wait a minute, Chief.
Of course, that's it-- - the mustache.
- What mustache?
Bediyoskin doesn't have a mustache.
No, but Dr. Waldo Smith does.
Russell Bediyoskin is my brother.
Then your real name is Waldo Bediyoskin.
No, Russell's real name is Smith.
He changed it to Bediyoskin when he went into the movies.
You know how actors are.
Was your brother ever in this laboratory?
- Oh, yes.
- Then he had access to the formula.
Well, yes, but I can't believe he would steal it, - Not Russell.
- Chief, the admiral's on television.
He's going to introduce the president.
- Have you a set?
- Yes, right over here.
Pardon me.
Admiral: And so I repeat, fellow citizens, there is no cause for alarm.
Not over an hour ago we located and captured the television station from which KAOS was broadcasting.
It was located right here-- uh-oh--  in the middle of the Arizona desert.
Yes, that's the place.
And now I take great pleasure in bringing you the President of the United States.
But first a word about deodorants that really work.
Hello?
Yes, it's the Chief.
What?
We'll be right over.
- What is it, Chief?
- Bediyoskin just came to, but the doctor doesn't know how long he will remain conscious.
We'd better get over the hospital right away, Chief.
That's right, Chief.
If Bediyoskin has regained consciousness, we'll want him to talk to us, not KAOS.
That's right.
Let's go.
How is he?
He's regained consciousness but he's terribly weak.
Mr. Bediyoskin, I'm Maxwell Smart.
Remember me?
Who has the formula?
Please, you've got to tell us.
It's the only way to keep KAOS from killing you.
- Max, he won't talk.
- He can't talk.
He wants your pen.
He wants to write something.
I don't think he has the strength.
Just write the name of the man who has the formula.
No, it's too strenuous.
I can't let him exert himself any more.
- Please.
- He must rest.
- What has he written, Max?
- I can't make out his handwriting.
- Can you, Chief?
- No, I can't.
Well, it's a good thing we're in a hospital.
All we have to do is to get ahold of a pharmacist.
Anybody who can read a prescription can read anything.
Please, could you talk outside?
All right, Doctor.
But if he regains consciousness, please call us.
Looks like initials to me.
- Wait a minute, Chief, that's it.
-  He hasn't the strength to write the full name, so he-- Max, the man on the crutches!
He's a KAOS agent.
Stop!
The old gun-in-the-crutch trick.
I'll get him, Chief.
Max, the Chief's been hit!
- Chief, are you all right?
- Go after them, Max.
- No, Chief, I can't leave you.
- I'll be all right, Max.
No, Chief.
Nurse!
Nurse!
Nurse, this man has been hit.
We've gotta get him into a room-- surgery.
Have you got hospitalization?
Do you have your card with you?
No, you see, you don't understand.
He didn't know this was gonna happen.
He will have to go to the Admittance Office.
- You'll have to leave a deposit.
- But he's been wounded.
Well, I'm sorry, those are the rules.
Well, look, could I buy a dollar's worth of bandages?
Max, look out!
Chief, it's ticking.
It's a foot grenade.
- It will blow out the whole floor.
- Right, Chief.
It's gonna explode.
Get rid of it, Max!
- Right, Chief.
- You've got 10 seconds.
- What?
- You've got seven seconds!
Max, there's only four seconds left!
Max.
- That was a close one, Chief.
- I'm proud of you, Max.
- I'm sorry-- I-- - Don't try to talk, Chief.
Try to save your strength.
Oh, Max.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Max, the Chief's been hit!
I'm sorry-- Don't try to talk, Chief, try to save your strength.
Oh, Max, the Chief's got to be all right.
He's just got to be.
If anything happens to him-- - 99 - Please tell me he'll be all right.
- 99 - Tell me he'll be all right, Max.
Tell me, Max.
Tell me.
- He'll be all right.
- You're just saying that.
I feel about the Chief.
I know, Max.
He yells at you a lot, but he really likes you so much.
Yes.
You know, it's funny, 99, at a time like this you remember little things.
Do you know, when I first came to CONTROL, - the Chief had a full head of hair?
- Really?
When I came here he was bald.
That's right.
You joined two weeks after I did.
Oh, Max, I'm so afraid KAOS will-- I mean, if anything should happen to you, I'd-- Don't worry, 99.
Nothing's going to happen to me.
You know what I mean, Max.
Yes, I do, Ernestine.
That's the first time you've ever called me Ernestine.
- I know.
- I wish it were my name.
Admiral Hargrade?
Oh, there you are.
There certainly are a lot of sharp turns in this hall.
What are you doing here, Admiral?
What am I doing here?
My boy, when the President of the United States puts me in charge of a case, I take charge.
-  - Don't overtax yourself, sir.
Nonsense, my boy.
I may be 91 years old, but I have just as much vim and vigor as I had when I was 32.
Well, maybe 31.
a very bad year.
All right, 86, let me have your report.
Well, it's bad news, sir.
The Chief has been hurt.
Tell me the bad news first, then we'll discuss the Chief.
That's it, sir.
The Chief has been shot.
Well, what about our witness, Bediyoskin?
Did you talk to him while he was conscious?
Did he tell you who has the stolen formula?
Well, he wasn't able to talk, but he wrote something down on a piece of paper.
That's a piece of paper all right.
We'd better get this over to Bediyoskin's brother right away.
If anybody can read this, it's Dr. Smith.
This piece of paper will tell us who has the stolen formula.
I can't believe this!
The Chief is lying in there in critical condition, and all you're worried about is the formula.
Now see here, young lady, I am a soldier and so is the man in that room.
Our nation's security comes before any one man.
And if one of us falls by the wayside, we must still move forward.
-  - We have to not get him too excited.
No, it's all right, 99.
It's time for his nap anyway.
Let's get him over there and stand him against the wall.
All right.
Let's go look in on the Chief, Max.
Right, 99.
Have a good rest, old timer.
- Hi.
- Hello, Chief.
What's new?
The doctor says you're gonna be just fine.
Yes, Chief, but it's very important that you get a lot of peace and quiet.
And I'm personally gonna see to it that you get-- Sorry about that, Chief.
Now if there's anything I can do, anything at all, don't hesitate to let me know.
If you need blood, you can have mine.
Excuse me, I have to check his chart.
Well, we have to be going anyway, Chief.
I've got to get Bediyoskin's message over to Dr. Smith.
There's every chance in the world that he may be able to decipher his brother's handwriting.
Put your hands up.
Max!
The doctor expressly said that the Chief should have rest, peace and quiet.
She's a KAOS agent.
Max, look!
How did you know she wasn't a nurse?
A nurse doesn't wear high heels on duty, Max.
Hold it!
All right, get on your feet.
Max!
- Max, are you all right?
- Yes.
- Don't let her get away, 99.
- Right, Max.
Now you just relax, Chief, and get some sleep.
There she goes, Max.
The Chief's car.
Larrabee, quick, follow that car.
Right, 86!
- I'll go first.
- Right, Max.
Man on  If we do not receive $1 billion we will unleash the terrifying power of Formula 6076767.
Your country will be turned into a wasteland.
KAOS has moved ahead with its threat to destroy your country.
Less than 30 minutes ago we dried up another body of water-- Niagara Falls.
Isn't that terrible?
Now thousands of honeymooners will be stranded up there with nothing to do.
Dr. Smith, you must decipher your brother's handwriting.
If you fail, the entire country may be destroyed by the very formula you have created.
It's three initials-- T.B.O. Whose initials are T.B.O.?
T.B.O.?
Why does that sound so familiar?
-  - Would you get that?
- Where's the phone?
- It's the microscope.
No no no, Internal Security changed it this morning.
It's the Bunsen burner.
You listen to the metal part and talk into the flame.
A hotline, huh?
This is CONTROL Laboratory, Maxwell Smart speaking.
Uh, I blew the connection.
There's a big black T, a lot of little letters, a big B, and then-- Hello.
He's reporting in that he infiltrated the laundry.
The laundry.
That's it.
These are the laundry tickets that I found in your brother's clothes at the hotel room.
"Three Brothers Omniwash"-- T.B.O. Good girl, 99.
Now I want you and 86 to go to that laundry immediately.
This is a Code P alert.
That's "P" as in "Peter".
Hello, 13.
This is a Code "P" alert.
That's "P" as in "Peter".
Hello, 13.
I was saying it's a Code "P" alert-- eh how about "L" for "Lamont"?
No.
Well, I'll tell him when I get there.
- Come on, 99.
- Right, Max.
Hi, 99, where have you been keeping yourself?
Hello, 13.
How are you doing in there?
If you two are quite finished, do you mind if we get down to business?
Have you learned anything, 13?
Yeah, I-- oh, somebody's coming.
Listen, you'd better keep stuffing clothes in here so we don't look suspicious.
And if anybody comes by, close the door.
The laundry is a front for a horse room.
The machines represent different horses and races throughout the country.
The bets are in the laundry bags - and they're deposited in the machi-- - Shh, someone's coming.
--are deposited in the machines by runners posing as customers.
Of course.
That explains everything.
That's why you found the laundry tickets in Bediyoskin's room.
The laundry tickets are the bets for the races.
- The red tickets - Shh.
He's coming back.
are $500 bets, and the white ones are $1,000.
Bediyoskin had six $1,000 tickets.
Of course, of course.
He was betting on the races and losing and he had to pay off, so he stole the formula and sold it to KAOS.
Yeah.
86, do you think you'll be needing me anymore?
No, I don't think so, 13.
Well, I can't wait to get home and take a warm bath.
- That man who just came in.
-  - What about him?
- Don't you recognize him, Max?
That's the drunk who was in the hotel lobby when Bediyoskin was shot.
You're right, 99.
Why, he could have shot Bediyoskin.
- Do you think he saw us?
- No, I don't think so, but we'd better step back here just in case he comes out.
Strange, his showing up here.
Well, maybe he's a horseplayer.
Max, I have a hunch.
Call it woman's intuition, but his being here is not just a coincidence.
Now supposing he owns this place and supposing Bediyoskin had lost heavily at the races and supposing he's the bookmaker that Bediyoskin had to pay off.
Well, that's a lot of supposing, 99, but you just may be right.
And if you are then the pieces begin to fit together very nicely.
If we could just figure out what T.B.O. stands for.
T.B.O., T.B.O. Wait a minute, 99, I've got an idea.
T-B-- no, that's no good.
Max, look!
T.B.O. Yes, and a lot of little letters underneath it.
R-L-A-N-D-O.
Orlando, and a phone number.
Max, "2-1-3"-- that's the area code for Los Angeles.
Maybe someone called a T.B. Orlando in Los Angeles.
- Do you think Orlando is a name?
- Could be.
Well, there's only one way to find out, 99.
I'm going to call that number.
Hello, Operator?
This is Maxwell Smart.
I want to call long distance, Los Angeles, California.
The number is 462-7399.
I want to speak person-to-person to a Mr. Orlando.
- Panamint Studios.
- It's Panamint Studios.
Mr. Orlando?
Yes, we have a Mr. Orlando.
T.B. Orlando.
Shall I ring him?
No, never mind.
Well, that's it, 99.
We've found our T.B.O. Come on, we're going to Los Angeles.
- Max, why didn't you talk to him?
- Why warn him?
This way nobody knows we're coming.
Come on.
A man called Smart just phoned from Washington inquiring about Orlando.
Look, fella, you can't see Mr. Orlando without a pass.
Besides, I don't believe you're his brother.
Can you please stand back and let Mr. Hurrah's car through?
Mr. Hurrah?
Wait a minute, we know Mr. Hurrah.
If he says it's okay, can we get in?
He's the big one.
You get an okay from Mr. Hurrah and you're in.
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
Uh, Mr. Hurrah, I don't know if you remember me or not, but we met in Washington when your friend Bediyoskin was-- Of course, when Bediyoskin was-- was what?
- Uh, shot.
- Shot.
Yes, terrible sad.
Some actors should be shot, but not Bediyoskin.
What are you doing here?
My sister and I just came out here to see a friend in the studio, but they won't let us in.
You want to get in the studio-- you're in the studio.
This man is a very dear friend of mine.
You let him in.
- Yes, sir.
- Come, I'll give you a ride.
Get in.
Oh, well, we wouldn't want to put you out, Mr. Hurrah.
Nonsense, nonsense, my dear friend.
Get in, get in.
Bring your sister.
Get in.
Plenty of room.
Come right here.
That's it.
I'll make a little room.
Sit right here, my dear.
Take this.
That's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Okay.
Okay.
You all right?
Be careful, I'm on the edge of the car.
No, this is "The Edge of the Car," my new picture.
Are you sure we're not putting you to any trouble?
- No.
Where are you going, my friend?
- Stage 7.
Here we are.
I hope we didn't take you out of your way.
Not at all, my friend.
I'm so glad you could have the ride with me.
Fine, I'll just take that.
That's a girl.
Yes, there we are.
Who are you going to see on the lot?
- We're looking for a Mr. Orlando.
- Orlando?
Uh oh, there he is, over there with the green jacket.
- Well, goodbye, my friends.
- Thank you.
- Mr. Orlando, I have to talk to you.
- About what?
I'm Maxwell Smart, a government agent.
I don't know anything.
This concerns the whole world.
You've got to help us.
I have an appointment with Mr. Hurrah, and the big one doesn't like to be kept waiting.
Bediyoskin told us to contact you.
He even wrote your initials on a slip of paper-- T.B.O. T.B.O. can mean a lot of things.
Oh, really?
For instance, give me another T.B.O. - One T.B.O., 40¢ - T.B.O?
Tomato and bacon, on an onion roll.
You see?
Now go away.
Our nation's security is at stake.
You owe it to your country to tell us what you know.
Wait a minute.
Did you say Bediyoskin wrote the initials T.B.O. on a piece of paper?
- Yes.
- I must check something.
- What?
-  Not now.
Meet me on Stage 7.
Give me five minutes.
There must be a light switch in here somewhere, Max.
Forget it, 99.
It will make us perfect targets for Orlando.
Just stick close to me and hug the shadows.
Come on.
Take it easy, 99.
It's just a bunch of dummies.
They use them for fight scenes.
Max, look!
It's Orlando.
He's dead.
- Oh, Max, how terrible.
- I know.
That practically eliminates him as a suspect.
Come on, 99.
Let's get out of here.
Oh, Max, we're right back where we started.
We still don't know who the big one is.
- Yes, we'd better call the admiral.
- Right.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, 99.
- What?
It's been right here in front of our eyes all the time.
- What has?
- Of course.
Orlando said it, the guard said it, and now you just said it.
Said what, Max?
The big one-- T.B.O. T.B.O. stands for "The Big One".
Max, I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't you remember, 99?
Orlando said, "I've got an appointment with Otto Hurrah, and The Big One doesn't like to be kept waiting".
And then the guard said-- "If it's all right with The Big One, you're in".
T.B.O.-- The Big One is Otto Hurrah.
- Exactly.
- What are we going to do now, Max?
We'll just go over to Mr. Hurrah's office and have a little talk with him.
Why not have it here?
Run, 99, run.
- 99!
-  I'll get him, 99.
Thank you.
-  - Hi-ya!
-  - Ha!
Yah!
Missed.
Ha ha.
This is going to be a pleasure, Hurrah for you.
Tell me, Hurrah, what made you decide to join KAOS?
I'm a creative producer and director, bursting with new concepts.
I was wasted in the movie business.
KAOS had an opening for a mastermind, so I took it.
Besides, my agent recommended it.
But KAOS is vicious, evil and rotten.
So is my agent.
Your government made a big mistake not giving us the money, Mr. Smart.
Now everyone in America is doomed to die of thirst and starvation.
You're the one who's made the mistake, Hurrah.
Yes, I let others try to kill you.
I almost deprived myself of this measureless pleasure.
Any last words, Mr. Smart?
Yes.
You're under arrest.
Your last chance, Mr. Smart.
Make a phone call and guarantee the money, and I'll let you live.
You're bluffing, Hurrah.
You've used up most of the formula in demonstrations already.
Our chemists in Europe will duplicate the formula as soon as I deliver it there.
We have men in every airport, every seaport.
You'll never get the formula past them.
We shall see.
Correction-- I shall see.
You won't be alive.
Well, Hurrah, as they say in the movies, this is the end.
Don't worry, my friend.
I've never killed an unarmed man.
Sorry about that.
Well, sir, I'm very glad to tell you that the case is officially closed, and I will now turn over the wheel of the ship to you.
Well, Admiral, it was a-- a pleasure serving under you again, sir.
The pleasure was mine.
And now I've got to get to my doctor.
I'm overdue for my checkup.
When did you have your last one?
Yesterday.
I think we should all go home.
We could certainly use a nice, quiet weekend.
