{START OF EPISODE 01}
Good morning, everyone.
Ron Carlson here with the news brought to you every morning by Scrub.
- Hi, honey.
- I thought you'd left.
Oh, why?
It's early.
I have a feeling Mother's going to drop in.
It's late.
Just a minute.
She promised the next time she came she'd let me know in advance.
- And now a special announcement: Darrin Stephens of this city will receive a visit from his mother-in-law today.
That's what you call letting me know in advance?
- You didn't specify how far in advance.
This is for you, darling.
- Who's it from?
- Ticheba.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Tiche-who?
Ticheba.
She's - Oh, my goodness.
- What does she say?
She said - Oh, my goodness.
- Stop saying that and tell me.
She's coming for a visit.
Oh, my goodness.
Look, honey, if it's going to upset you, just tell this Ticheba not to come.
Not to come?
That's the funniest thing you've ever said.
- Nobody tells Ticheba anything.
- Why not?
Who is she?
Queen of the witches or something?
- That is right.
- That's right.
Ask a silly question Well, sweetheart, you'll like her.
Once you get used to her.
She likes things her own way and will brook no denial.
- I suppose that's natural for a queen.
- Exactly.
- What's your excuse?
- Darrin!
Samantha, I will not stand here and be insulted by something which is 94 percent water.
- Mother!
- Oh, yeah?
What about something which is 100 percent hot air?
Darrin, would you please try and control yourself?
You may rise.
Very nice.
- Very nice indeed.
- Oh, well - Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Where is the main house?
I'm afraid this is it.
Really?
If you don't mind, I think I'd prefer my own chair.
Of course not, Your Majesty.
Now, just a minute.
Yes?
I forgot the question.
- How long is she gonna be here?
- Well, I don't know, sweetheart.
Well, it doesn't matter.
As long as she's gone by the time I get home.
Well, I'm leaving.
Splendid!
Come here, my dear.
My dear, I have decided to abdicate.
And you have been chosen to serve in my place.
In your place?
Tomorrow night, a universal coven will witness your coronation.
- What?
- Oh, my dear!
- Mother!
- My little girl, Queen of the Witches.
- But I can't believe it.
- Oh, my baby!
One of the chosen few.
Well, I'm honoured, Your Majesty, more than words can express.
And I can't accept it.
I beg your pardon.
I know what's bothering her.
It's Dumbo.
Well, that's hardly a problem.
I'll turn him into something suitable, like a doormat.
No!
If you will show me my room, I'd like to rest.
Right this way, Your Majesty.
Now, please, let me try and explain, Your Majesty.
You see, when I married Darrin, I promised I wouldn't use witchcraft.
Now, he's been very understanding up until now but he'd never understand this.
Your Majesty, I can't be queen.
I'm married to a mortal and I have a child and a house to take care of.
One thing you must do is find quarters more suitable for a queen.
Perhaps you'd like some of your own furniture up here.
That might help.
There, now, that's better.
Your Majesty, do you understand?
It's a bit crowded, isn't it?
You're not listening to me, Your Majesty.
Of course I am.
I heard every word you said.
Your husband represents a problem, and I have told you I personally will take care of Dumbo.
His name is Darrin.
Either way, you have no problem.
- What's beyond that wall?
- The master bedroom.
Then if you don't mind Your Majesty, I refuse to be queen.
We do our best, but sometimes we fail.
Samantha, come with me.
Will you stop making a fool of yourself?
When you've been selected queen, our highest honour you do not have the privilege of turning it down.
You must accept.
- But that's not fair.
- Why?
Well, I mean, it's all right for other witches.
They don't have Darrin to contend with, but l Mother, Darrin's simply going to explode.
Good.
It'll save us the trouble of turning him into a doormat.
Oh, you can joke.
You can joke, but I've gotta tell him.
I can just hear the explosion.
Queen?
Of the Witches?
What does that make me, Prince Valiant?
- This is no joking matter.
- You're not kidding!
It's a great, great honour.
And it means a lot to me and even more to Mother.
I can't refuse.
And what I think doesn't count?
I'm just a doormat around here, I suppose.
- Not yet.
- What?
I promise, you won't be inconvenienced.
I won't.
Is this a sample of what I can expect?
Oh, no, no, sweetheart.
Ticheba insisted upon doing a little redecorating.
I'll change it as soon as she leaves.
She feels more at home this way.
Where does she live, the Taj Mahal?
Darrin, try to understand.
Being queen is something that every witch mother dreams of for her girl just as every American father dreams that someday his boy will be president.
If memory serves no president has ever been a wife and a mother, which you are.
How will you take care of your home and your family?
Well, I've got that all worked out.
Whatever business does come up, I'll just take care of it after midnight.
I just don't understand.
Why you?
Yeah.
Why me?
Well it's sort of hard to explain.
Try.
Well, certain witches are chosen at birth.
When you've been selected, you must serve.
You have no choice.
Then it really doesn't matter what I think.
Not really.
In that case, what can I say?
Oh, Darrin, I knew you'd understand.
All hail Ticheba, our queen.
You may rise.
This universal coven I do convene.
Its purpose, you know, to crown a queen to rule all witchdom from this point hence.
If all be present let the oath-taking commence.
Samantha, gentle Samantha, fair Before your peers Assembled here Are you ready now to tak e The oath of office of which I spak e?
I am.
Let the bearers of The Book of Rites draw near And as I read, let all give ear These words I read, say after me And weigh each one most carefully I, Samantha, do solemnly swear In accepting the crown To hold it dear I, Samantha, do solemnly swear In accepting the crown To hold it dear To be faithful and never to forsak e The holy office which I tak e To be faithful and never to forsak e The holy office which I tak e To preserve, protect And to defend The laws of witchdom to the end To preserve, protect And to defend The laws of witchdom to the end But only after midnight, please.
You see, I promised my husband And he'd flip his lid I'm trying to rhyme So please do as I bid Long live Queen Samantha.
Long live Queen Samantha.
Long live Queen Samantha.
Long live Queen Samantha.
Who's there?
Who's there?
I have an appointment with Her Majesty.
Downstairs.
Why are you disguised as a bird?
What disguise?
So I've been made a committee of one to petition Your Majesty for pardon for all of us.
- Are there many of you?
- I'd hate to tell you how many.
Ticheba had a pretty short fuse, you know.
One wrong word and bingo, we were transformed.
Well, l Darrin, don't tell me we woke you.
All right, I won't tell you.
I always get up at 3:00 in the morning.
Forgive me for not waiting in line, Your Majesty but could you spare a moment of your time?
Certainly.
You may withdraw.
Look, tomorrow morning I've got a meeting with a man who is the president of one of the largest steel companies in the country.
Now, his advertising account is worth over $8.5 million in billing.
If I can swing him over to our agency, they've got to give me a bonus.
- Or at least make me a partner.
- Well, that's wonderful, sweetheart.
It won't be if I fall asleep during that meeting.
Most of this activity is caused by the changeover in administration.
- It'll taper off, you'll see.
- It better taper and soon.
I'm gonna get myself a glass of milk.
You can tell your friends I'll pardon them all.
You will?
Oh, thank you, Your Majesty.
Thank you.
Tell them to assemble here tomorrow but remember, not before 12.
Thank you.
- Here you are, Mr. Rohrbach.
- Thank you.
- Sweetheart?
- Thank you, honey.
These crabmeat things are delicious.
Oh, well, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I just threw them together.
If you'll excuse me, I have another batch in the oven.
Well, I like what I see, Stephens.
The house, good taste without ostentation.
- Thank you, sir.
Your wife's gonna fit into the Rohrbach family real well.
I'm glad you feel that way, sir.
It'll take a week to sever relations with the company handling our account.
Heck, what's a week?
Maybe two weeks at the outside, but What was that?
Pardon?
Didn't you just see a bird fly through here?
What bird?
It was probably just a bird.
A shadow.
- You need some ice?
- No, no, thanks.
I need some ice.
Fresh out of ice.
But I told you, not until after 12 midnight.
Oh, 12 midnight.
Sam, get that bird out of here and fast.
There's been a terrible misunderstanding.
Wait'll you see the misunderstanding we'll have.
I'll find out what's taking so long.
Leave before you end up in a fricassee.
- Right.
- What's going on?
I told you to wait outside, didn't I?
Sam, do something.
You should've seen Rohrbach's face when that bird flew in.
And I'll bet when he saw the chair Saw the chair?
Holy mackerel!
How are you doing, sir?
A chair just came in that door and walked right through this hall.
Mr. Rohrbach, have you been: I only had one.
And I know what I saw.
Think what you're saying.
A chair came through that door and walked through this hall?
Well, a chair can't walk any more than a lamp can.
What kind of a place is this?
What are you referring to, sir?
I don't know what's going on, but I don't want any part of it.
And I don't want any part of anybody that's got any part of it.
Before you leave, sir, what about your account?
What account?
All right, everybody off the fat guy, and clear out till midnight.
Oh, Darrin, I'm sorry.
- Sam, I want you to abdicate.
- What?
I want you to quit!
But I can't.
I just took the oath of office.
Okay, you said you couldn't refuse the crown.
Okay!
So you accepted it.
You've been queen for a day.
That's enough!
- No, it isn't.
- I say it is.
I have to serve for at least a year.
You didn't tell me that.
I didn't?
Well, I Well, I guess you didn't ask.
Oh, now, Darrin, please be reasonable.
A year isn't very long.
You'll see how quickly it'll pass.
Then I'll quit.
In that case, call me in about a year.
- I'll be at Joe's.
- Joe's?
Joe's Bar and Grill.
I tell you, a man can take just so much.
- Then he has got to walk.
- You're so right.
"It's just for a year," she says.
"Okay," I say.
"Call me in about a year.
I'll be at Joe's Bar and Grill".
I know how you feel.
I got a problem with my wife too.
Her mother.
With all due respect, friend, your problem can't be as bad as mine.
- My wife is Queen of the Witches.
- She can't be.
My mother-in-law's got that job.
Samantha, it's almost midnight, and the transformees will be arriving.
You should be getting into your robes.
- I thought I heard a car.
- Lf he comes back, he comes back.
If he doesn't, we'll open a bottle of champagne.
Well, I thought that was rather a good idea.
Well, I'm just not going to stand for it in my house.
If I have to, I won't go home for a year.
It's just about a year since I've been home.
I mean it, I - It is?
- I never should've told my mother-in-law to get out of the house.
She owns it.
You haven't seen your family in all that time?
I went back once.
About six months ago.
My kid didn't recognize me.
And the dog bit me.
And he's my dog!
Comes in every night and cries like that.
You know, pal, this job gives me a chance to see some pretty good observations.
Now, he thinks his mother-in-law's a holy terror and you think your wife's Queen of the Witches.
But if the truth be it known they all got their good points.
Right, pal?
They sure do, pal.
They sure do.
Hi.
Say You missed all the excitement.
She was sensational.
The incantation was beautiful.
And, you know, she actually produced a little fire and brimstone.
Haven't seen that in ages.
And then she touched each one of us with her sceptre and presto we were all back to our original form.
Is that better?
You know, I'm gonna miss being a bird.
Samantha, bad news.
He's back.
Better hurry, Endora.
You'll be late for the monster rally.
Darrin.
Mother, don't you have someplace to fly?
Sweetheart now, don't you know that you're more important to me than any old crown?
Now, I don't know what's gonna happen if I resign.
No one's ever done it.
- But I'm going to.
- Honey l've been doing some thinking too.
And I don't wanna come home and find that my child doesn't know me and have the dog bite me.
What dog?
That's right, we don't have one.
Anyway, the thing I realized is that your being queen is part of what you are.
And if I love you enough, I have to accept that.
Just the way you accept certain things about my world.
So I'm at your disposal, Your Majesty.
Rise, silly goose.
Oh, Darrin!
Darrin, I'm terribly sorry.
Oh, it was a terrible mistake.
Darrin?
Come back here.
Darrin.
Darrin.
Oh, please.
Darrin.
Please, if you'd just stand still, then I could change you back.
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart.
Come on, come on.
Oh, please.
Darrin, please.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Yes.
Oh, that's a good girl.
Yes, she's Grandmama's good girl.
Well, how are we doing?
Did anyone ever tell you that this child is positively incredible?
You tell her something, and she never forgets it.
Now watch.
Tabatha, stay right there.
Now, watch Grandmama.
Who is the prettiest little lady in the whole wide world?
Grandmama.
I believe in telling a child the absolute truth.
Did anyone ever tell you that you are impossibly endearing?
Now, you run along and have a nice lunch with what's-his-name.
I'm not having lunch with what's-his-name.
- You're not?
- No.
I'm having lunch with Darrin.
Now, Mother, one last thing.
Please remember, no witchcraft in front of Tabatha.
You know how it upsets him.
Who?
What's-his-name.
Bye-bye, love.
Be a good girl and take care of Grandmama.
You hear what she said?
Now, shall we pick out a nice toy to play with?
- What about the soldier?
- No.
- Or the drummer?
- No.
What about the teddy bear?
Oh, Tabatha.
Tabatha, how marvellous.
Especially when you consider the discouraging atmosphere around here.
What a pretty little doll.
You're doing very well, Tabatha.
Well, about time.
Know how long I been tracking you down?
Do you have a message for me?
Appears there's a big to-do in your honour at the Taj Mahal.
Expecting a couple thousand guests, the way I heard.
Oh, fiddle-faddle.
I know all that.
It's next week.
No, it ain't.
It's been moved up to today, 11:00.
Oh, how dreadful.
All those people expecting me and here I am sitting with a baby.
Well, appears to me you've got plenty of babysitters.
Pick any one of them toys, put a spell on it, and you've got yourself a sitter.
Of course.
You're absolutely right.
Thank you for an excellent suggestion.
Don't thank me.
Just leave a forwarding address next time.
Well There.
I think this is a nice babysitter.
Now watch, Tabatha.
Watch Grandmama.
Say hello to your babysitter.
Hi.
Isn't that fun, Tabatha?
Would you care to take the busby off?
Or are you more comfortable with it on?
It's a shame we can't make you talk, but as long as you understand I suppose you'll do.
Now look, the juice is in the refrigerator.
She takes it at 11, and she naps at 1.
And if there's anything you need, just ring, and I'll pop right back.
All right?
Have fun, love bug.
Juice.
Drink.
Juice.
Drink.
I'll just walk you to the elevator, Bob, and then - Darrin.
How are you, boy?
- Hello, Bob.
- Samantha, what a pleasant surprise.
- Nice to see you, Bob.
Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
You two know each other?
- Why certainly.
We're old friends.
I'm just taking Samantha to lunch.
- What's the occasion?
- They don't need one.
They're not married that long.
Well, I guess I'll be running along.
See you tonight.
Right?
Right.
About 7:30.
- Larry.
- Bob.
- Well - Darrin, can you spare me a second before you go?
- Sure, Lar.
Be right back, honey.
I read your memo on the MacGregor account.
Got some good points.
You mentioned that this morning, Larry.
Oh, yes.
Yeah, that's right.
What are you seeing Chase about?
Nothing.
He's just coming to dinner.
So Chase is having dinner with you, huh?
Well, actually, I'm just returning an obligation.
- He had us to dinner a few weeks ago.
- Oh, really?
He had you to dinner?
It was really more of a buffet.
- I'm sorry, Larry.
- About what?
It's part of your job to entertain clients.
- I'm glad you feel that way.
- Glad you mention it, though because Louise and I were thinking of dropping in on you tonight.
I wish you would.
Please.
You know you're always welcome.
If we were welcome, you'd have invited us to dinner.
I am inviting you to dinner.
Will you please come to dinner?
- Darrin, I wouldn't dream of horning in.
- We'd love to have you horn in.
Come.
- Absolutely not.
- Please.
- Forget it.
- I insist.
- I refuse.
- Well, if you're sure.
- What time?
- Seven-thirty.
Thank you, Larry.
I'm glad I talked you into it.
Hello?
Hello?
Honey.
You wouldn't believe what went on in Larry's office.
I finally had to invite them to dinner tonight.
What's the matter?
Well, I just called the house and it sounded like someone picked up the phone but nobody said hello.
Nobody said hello?
Mother.
Mother?
Do you want to tell me again how responsible your mother is?
Well No.
I can't understand how this could happen.
But I'm sure it's nothing to be concerned about.
I'll just change everything back the way it was.
Are you sure you can?
- Oh, sure I'm sure.
- Okay.
Okay.
The only thing I'm not sure about is how.
Now pay attention, all of you.
Look me right in the eye.
That goes for you too, Farley.
Now concentrate.
Listen.
One re or re ick ery Ann Phillison folison, Nicholas John Queevy quavy, English Navy Stiglam, staglam, rack B-A-C-K spells "back" And back goes you Marvellous.
- No luck?
- Oh, honey, it's no use.
I've tried every spell I know.
I've even made up a few.
Mother's the only one who can change them back.
Now look, while I try and locate her, you better hide all of Tabatha's toys.
You mean, you think maybe Tabatha?
Could be.
You know something, Sam?
I'm a medical phenomenon.
- What do you mean by that?
- I don't have an ulcer.
Oh, Darrin, hurry up.
Oh, Mother.
Where could she be?
I'm sorry to have to do this to you, sweetheart but until you unlearn what your grandma taught you it's got to be done.
Sorry, honey.
- Well?
- No, I can't seem to locate her.
So we'll just have to wait till she gets back.
- Meanwhile, we'd better cancel dinner.
- I already have.
- Sort of.
- Sort of?
Well, I called Larry and left a message with Louise.
Luckily Larry wasn't there.
But the Chases are coming.
What do I tell them when they get here?
Welcome to Disneyland?
Don't worry, sweetheart.
We'll keep them locked in the guest room.
You don't understand.
Those things running around in there make me nervous.
Just because I don't have an ulcer now doesn't mean I can't get one.
Hi, hon.
Hi.
A little wine for our hosts.
They just called.
The dinner's off.
It's something about Tabatha.
- What's wrong?
- Well, Darrin wasn't too clear but he said it's nothing serious, one of those 24-hour things.
- That's a shame.
- I'm sure she'll be fine.
No, I mean about the dinner.
I was looking forward to spending the evening with Bob Chase.
Did you know he had Sam and Darrin to dinner a few weeks ago?
Well, what about it?
Well, I'm not saying that I suspect him of anything but he has been getting awfully chummy with one of our best clients.
And it wouldn't be the first time that somebody started his own agency with a stolen client.
You know something, Larry?
You're sick.
Really?
I'd rather be sick than sorry.
Hey, you know the Chases will be high and dry too.
Why don't I give them a call and invite them out to dinner.
Good suggestion.
Larry.
Just remember this: Chase's billings come to over 10 million.
Hello, this is Larry Tate.
May I speak to Bob Chase, please?
How about Mrs. Chase?
Well, do you know where I can reach them?
I see.
No, thanks.
I know the number.
Sick, huh?
I'm sure there must be some explanation.
You bet there is.
Darrin doesn't want me there with Chase.
Look, will you stop exaggerating.
I'll fix us a nice dinner, and we'll open the wine.
Okay?
That wine is too expensive for us to drink.
I bought it to impress Chase.
Anyway, I'm not hungry.
I'm restless.
I think I'll go out for a little ride.
Larry, just promise me you're not gonna do anything foolish.
- Like what?
- Like going by Darrin's to check.
You think I'm gonna barge in there and make a fool of myself?
- Well, I should hope not.
I'll just drive by and see what I can see from the street.
When your mother gets back she's gonna hear a few thousand well-chosen words from me.
Darrin, that's it.
Mother knows you're angry, so she's afraid to come back.
- That's not it.
- I don't think so.
I'm sure it was something terribly important that took her away.
I never thought I'd be mad about her being taken away.
The only good thing that's happened is that Larry wasn't home when I called.
Sometimes he's like a kid.
Oh, my goodness!
A costume party.
Just hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Hold it!
Everybody upstairs!
Everybody upstairs!
We'll get these upstairs, lock them in and then come back for the others.
Oh, my goodness.
Hello there.
Quite a party.
Say, did you happen to run into Bob Chase in there?
And she calls me sick.
Say, don't I know you?
Wait a minute.
You work for me, don't you?
I thought so.
You must be the new man in Accounting, right?
Now don't tell me the name.
I'll get it.
Max Hopkins, right?
I never forget an employee's name.
Never.
Confidentially, Max has Darrin asked you to join his new agency?
Well, that's it, except for the soldier.
I'll go get him.
You check Tabatha.
Let's you and I have a little discussion.
But not here.
Let's go someplace and have a drink.
Okay?
Okay, Max, watch your hat.
Off we go.
Oh, my stars.
Well, they're all locked up, and Tabatha's asleep.
Now, if your mother would only get back.
What about the soldier?
Did you find him?
- Sort of.
- What do you mean by that?
- He left.
- He left?
!
I tell you, Max.
You work and slave to build up an organization and then what happens?
One sour apple comes along and the barrel goes down the drain.
Know what I mean?
Gotta say one thing for you, Max.
You're a darn good listener.
Very good quality in a man.
- What's that?
- We get all kinds in here.
From the normal to the mentally insane.
Happy Times Bar.
Joe the mixologist speaking.
Is Larry Tate there with a fellow in costume?
Yeah, they're here.
Good.
Keep them there.
I'll do the best I can.
Bye.
- That's where they are.
- You were lucky.
You only had to call about 20 of Larry's favourite bars.
Yeah, but now that I've found him, what am I gonna tell him?
Drink up, Max.
You're gonna go far with McMann & Tate because one thing we value Well, well, well, if it isn't speak-of-the-devil.
Larry, I've got to talk to you.
There's nothing to talk about.
All been said and done.
Come on, Max.
This place is getting crowded.
You stay there, Max.
Now look, Larry.
Max?
No use pretending.
Max has already told me that you asked him to join your new agency.
How could he tell you?
What new agency?
Will you stop it?
The one you're raiding my staff and stealing my clients to open is the one.
- Check.
Check, please.
- But, Larry Here, this should cover it.
I suppose you think that's gonna make up for stabbing me in the back, you Brutus.
Larry, doesn't it seem odd to you that Max, as you call him hasn't said a word all evening?
Well, some people don't have small talk.
But he's a great listener.
You could take a lesson from him.
Larry, he's not human.
Now you're going overboard.
I'll admit he's kind of dull, but I'm trying to tell you something.
He's a doll.
Well, make up your mind.
Either you like him, or you don't.
Larry, please.
Sit down, please.
Please sit down.
Samantha's mother was babysitting for us today.
And, Larry, you're not going to believe this, but she Hi, Larry.
- Did you see that?
- I didn't see anything.
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing.
- I'll have a double this time.
- I'll have one too.
Excuse us, Larry.
- Where did she come from?
- Beats me.
The toys got away again.
But fortunately, Mother arrived and took care of them.
What's going on here?
Larry thinks we're having a costume party.
And he thinks that he's an employee and that I'm trying to steal him and Bob Chase to open my own agency.
- But that's crazy.
- I know.
But how do we convince Larry?
I know.
Mother gave me the spell, so I'll just change him back to toy size.
- Right here?
- Believe me.
It's the only way to straighten Larry out.
Now you go keep him busy for a minute.
I'll have another drink.
So Max told you everything, huh, Larry?
Yeah.
And for your information, he's going to stick with me.
Well, Larry, if you don't mind, I'd like to get that straight from Max.
All right.
Max, I want you to tell Benedict Arnold I want you to tell You mean l've spent the whole evening talking to a toy soldier?
I'm afraid so, Larry.
Cute little fellow, isn't he?
- Here's the drink you ordered.
- Are you kidding?
I'm off that stuff for good.
And I'm taking this to remind me.
Larry, perhaps we ought to drive you home.
Oh, don't I know it.
Time like this, you find out who your real friends are.
Right, Max?
Come on, Larry.
Come on.
I don't know why you're still angry.
Everything turned out all right.
Mother apologized all over the place.
First time she's ever done that.
The point is, Tabatha can still put a spell on her toys.
What are we going to do about that?
Well, we'll just have to teach her not to the way we teach her how not to do other bad things, like throwing things Turning toys into people is not like throwing things.
Sweetheart, I had a talk with her, and I'm sure she really understands.
I hope you're right.
Isn't she a little doll?
Angel.
This is Tabatha.
Isn't that cute?
Want to talk to Daddy?
How about that?
For me?
Telephone for you.
This is for my dad.
Thank you.
Hello.
This is Daddy speaking.
Who is this?
Pittsburgh?
Excuse the call.
Well, isn't that wonderful?
I mean, I couldn't do that until I was 5 years old.
Sam, our daughter just made a long-distance call on a toy telephone.
Doesn't that bother you?
Darrin, I love you.
Daddy mad.
Besides, if the phone company doesn't find out what difference does it make?
Not mad anymore.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
That should give you an idea how we handle the Chef Romani products in our European market.
Now we come to invade the American market.
This is one invasion we Americans will surrender to without a fight.
With the proper propaganda.
- We prefer to call it commercials.
- Of course.
Mr. Arcarius, I pride myself on being an average American and the average American eats Italian food once a week.
- I sometimes eat it twice.
- Good boy.
Now, I'm certain we here at McMann & Tate have the personnel the imagination I am aware of your reputation, Mr. Tate.
But there is something more important.
Mr. Romani's impression of you will be based not so much on campaigns as on personality.
Now, it might be a nice little touch of diplomacy if one of you had a smattering of Italian.
No problem.
Darrin is fluent in the tongue.
Well, I wouldn't exactly say fluent.
I have a smattering of fluency.
- He speaks French too.
- Oh, marvellous.
It's been a splendid meeting, gentlemen.
I am very encouraged and certain we will do business together.
- Good.
- I will keep in touch.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
He speaks German too.
Bye-bye.
How was that for fancy footwork, huh?
You put your fancy foot in my mouth.
I don't know a word of Italian.
So for $500,000 in billings, you'll learn.
I don't have a facility for languages.
In college I was a D student.
How hard can it be if every little kid in Italy can speak it?
Don't be funny.
Okay.
Let me put it this way.
You understand English?
Yes.
Then listen very carefully to Great White Father.
He speak softly but carry big stick.
Chef Romani, he big account.
So you learn to speak simple Italian or find other job.
So I accepted the challenge.
At first I was mad.
But then I asked myself, "Who am I mad at?
Larry"?
No.
I was mad at myself for being afraid to accept the challenge.
So I went over to the World Wide School of Languages and bought these albums.
- Sweetheart, I'm very proud of you.
Thank you.
It's just a matter of concentration, right?
Right.
But you didn't have to buy records.
I speak a little Italian.
- Perhaps l - Yeah.
I know, I know.
I'd rather do it by myself.
Now, if you'll go, I have to get to work.
- Go.
Go.
- Okay.
Hello.
My name Alfonso Martinelli.
I am your teacher.
- What is your name?
- Darrin Stephens.
Now say it in Italian.
Dino Stevanso?
In Italian you say: "Lo sono il signor blank, blank".
Io sono il signor blank, blank.
You see how easy?
Easy for you, difficult for me.
You meet beautiful girl in café and you wish to become acquainted.
Which means, "You have a body made for love".
Repeat after me.
Again.
Twice is enough.
If she does not respond, find another table.
What kind of a record is that?
"Simple phrases for the American bachelor in Italy".
Oh, for heaven's sake.
Darling, you and I can go to the opera at La Scala and weekends we can motor down to Venice.
Prince Pepe will put us up at the pink palazzo.
And afternoons, we can go to the American bar.
We can We can just stop dreaming.
What's-his-name will never learn the language.
And you'll be stuck here in this stultifying suburb for the rest of your unnatural life.
Mother, in the first place, I do not like the opera or Prince Pepe.
In the second place, what's-his-name's name is Darrin.
In the third place, I read "stultifying suburb" as home sweet home.
And in the fourth place l'll bet Darrin does learn Italian.
That would be nice.
That would be very nice.
That way, if you ever do make a trip to Europe dum-dum wouldn't be a source of embarrassment.
- Mother, dear?
- Yes?
Butt out.
Of course.
Good.
Now you will count, please.
Time.
If you counted to 10, you are a superior student.
To seven, you are average, and to five, stupido.
You really know how to hurt a guy.
Now I will test you on the months of the year which we had in the beginning of the record.
Begin, please.
January.
February.
Forget February.
March.
April I wish he might, I wish he may Speak lik e an Italian At the break of day Hey, how about that?
Now we'll review the conjugation of the verb "to see".
Darrin, did you say that?
You were expecting maybe Marcello Mastroianni?
- That's beautiful.
- Yeah, it was, wasn't it?
I guess sticking to it paid off.
- What time did you get to bed?
- Who got to bed?
I was up with those records all night.
Honey, it was exciting.
Suddenly, I felt like a sponge soaking it all in.
That Miss Petruccelli is quite a teacher.
- Hey, ask me the time.
- What time is it?
That's perfect.
They do smell nice, don't they?
Ask me something else.
Why don't you ask me how I feel.
- Darrin.
- Now, just a minuto, Samantha.
Now I gonna tell you the colours in a rainbow.
Why are you talking like that?
Why am I talking what way?
With an Italian accent.
Are you crazy?
Who's talking with an Italian accent?
I tell you what I gonna do.
Now I gonna speak to you the furniture.
How you like them apples?
I can't get over it.
I said, I couldn't get over it.
What do you mean you don't understand me?
Oh, I see.
You want some more practice, huh?
Well What do you mean, "what it says"?
Darrin wipe that glazed look off your eyes.
You're scaring me.
Darrin, quit fooling around.
You don't understand.
You really don't.
Mother did it.
Mother.
Mother!
Take it easy, sweetheart.
I'll fix everything.
Speak Italian but spoil the spell And speak your mother tongue As well Mother!
Endora!
Cat.
Cat.
Oh, Darrin.
I'm sorry, but it's the only way until I can find Mother.
The old-fashioned way, like in school.
I am happy to make your acquaintance.
I am happy to make your acquaintance.
I am.
I am.
- Happy.
- Happy.
- To make.
- To make.
- Your acquaintance.
- Your acquaintance.
Now say it.
Darrin.
Endora!
Larry Tate.
Hi, Sam, I thought I'd unclog the freeway and have Darrin drive with me.
Well, you certainly picked a fine morning to be thoughtful.
Well?
- Aren't you gonna ask me in?
- What for?
I mean, do come in, Larry, but Darrin's not here.
His car's out front.
I mean, he's upstairs.
- Well, that's here.
- Not really.
- He's in bed.
- Too much studying, huh?
Oh, you wouldn't believe it.
Well, as long as he can fake a few "Arrivederci Roma"s l'll be satisfied.
- Oh, he can fake that, all right.
- Well, I won't keep him long.
- Larry, I wish you wouldn't.
Son of a gun.
Marvellous.
You sounded just like a native.
He says, "Won't you have a seat"?
Boy, oh, boy.
You're great.
Just great.
I'm impressed.
I'm really impressed.
Now, come on.
Cut out the United Nations routine.
Darrin, Romani's coming to the office at 3 this afternoon.
Larry, I'm afraid you're wasting your breath.
Darrin can't understand a word you're saying.
- I beg your pardon?
- Well, it's quite normal.
Quite normal that he doesn't understand a word I'm saying?
Yes.
Isn't that marvellous?
Now I don't understand a word you're saying.
Well, let me see if I can explain it to you.
It's a technique.
It's called total immersion.
Darrin is drowning in the Italian language.
He is, huh?
Well, tell him to come up for air.
I'm afraid it's a little late, Larry.
He can't think or speak in anything but Italian.
You're not serious?
Boy, am I serious.
I know it's a put-on, but I'll go along with it.
Darrin, I want your recommendation on who to assign as copywriter and art director.
Bill Baxter e Sam Kaplan.
- He says Bill Baxter - Oh, I got the gist of it.
Thank you.
Happy to make your acquaintance.
All right, Darrin, you've had your little joke.
Now, come on.
Let's go to work.
Larry, I'm afraid that might be a little dangerous for him.
You see, he has to decompress from From the immersion.
- Yes.
- All right, Sam.
You make sure he's at the office at 3:00.
Three o'clock.
Three o'clock.
- Endora!
Endora!
- Mother!
Mother!
Oh, dear.
Sweetheart, you go on to the office.
I'll find Mother.
Welcome to the agency, Mr. Romani.
I hope the relationship will be long and fruitful.
Come in.
This is my associate Darrin Stephens.
Mr. Romani.
He wants to know what part of Italy he comes from.
He says he wasn't born in Italy.
He was born in the United States.
I know that.
He does not believe him.
No, no, signor Romani.
Now, enough's enough.
Now, stop showing off, Darrin.
Speak to him in English.
He says that to honour Mr. Romani, he wishes to speak Italian only.
Forget the italiano.
Speak to me in the English.
What do you mean you don't understand?
I heard you speak English yesterday.
I know you can hear me, Mother wherever you are, so you hear me good.
Now, I'm gonna count to three.
Not five, not four, but three.
And if you're not here on the count of three no matter where you are, what you're doing I am gonna forbid you to set foot in this house again.
One, two, three.
You said wherever I am.
Well, just don't stand there.
Here, do some work on your mama's back.
Mother, do you realize what you've done to Darrin?
Well, I've just given him a little private tutoring.
You have deprived Darrin of the use of the English language.
Oh, I have?
Well, so I've given him an overdose.
Your overdose can cost him his job!
Please don't shout, Samantha.
I will have to ask you to leave my bathroom.
And I will have to ask you to leave this house forever unless you un-spell Darrin.
Nag, nag, nag.
Cancel the spell.
That's an incantation?
What do you expect at this hour, darling?
Poetry?
Now, it isn't that I don't trust you, Mother, but you're coming with me.
Get dressed.
Mr. Romani, Stephens, like everyone else in McMann & Tate is dedicated to doing things to their fullest fruition.
No halfway measures at McMann & Tate.
Stephens is to be prided on his devotion to all Italian or no Italian.
Don't you agree?
You're going to speak to me in the English or I'm going to walk right out of here.
Okay, you want me to speak to you in English?
I'm gonna speak to you in English.
Darrin, are you out of your mind?
How dare you.
I'm doing the best I can.
Mother, do something.
I'm doing the best I can.
It has to take time, Samantha.
You are lying, Mr. Stephens.
No americano speaks italiano like that.
I swear to you, signor, I am 100 percent Yankee.
You're gonna be 100 percent unemployed Yankee if you don't apologize to Mr. Romani this minute.
I am very sorry if I've done anything to offend you, Mr. Romani.
But I'm sure I can explain.
You speak perfect English.
You was mocking me.
You were deliberately mocking him.
Deliberately!
And do you know why?
- Do you know why?
- No, but it better be good.
I'll tell you why.
Because Go on.
I was trying to impress on Mr. Romani the danger of the Romani image becoming provincial and laughable.
I hope there's more.
I despise those people who find dialect humour amusing.
My boss is a very sensitive man.
He didn't know what I was doing.
I'll take an oath on that.
Did you notice how incensed he was at my accent because he thought I was mocking you?
He was right!
I was mocking you deliberately.
- And do you know why?
- No, why?
If you multiply Mr. Tate by 100 million consumers I think you'll get what I'm driving at.
And I believe I can say without fear of contradiction that if you decide to give us the campaign our account will be The food may be Italian the accent American.
I understand what you say.
- What did he say?
- "What did he say"?
- "What did he say"?
- "What did he say"?
You got me cuckoo, but I don't care.
I like to do business with you.
You won't regret it, Mr. Romani.
Now, let me introduce you and Mr. Arcarius to the rest of the staff.
Happy to make your acquaintance.
Yes.
Likewise, I'm sure.
That's the greatest salesmanship I've ever seen.
You're a genius.
You're not going to understand this, Larry, but I have to be.
I don't expect any thanks, but at least a tiny pat on the head.
- How about a kick in the?
- Darrin!
She's my mother.
Oh, stop pouting, Dino.
All's well that ends well, as what's-his-name said.
I'm famished.
Why don't you take my daughter and me to a nice Italian dinner.
It's only 4:30 in the afternoon.
Oh, I'm still on European time.
Then why don't you go to dinner in Europe?
That's a splendid idea!
Let's go.
Sam!
- And on Mother's last trip to Italy - Quite recently.
Yes.
- She brought back two paintings, three evening dresses and 400 pounds of Romani products.
You know, I must congratulate you, Samantha.
You have a most brilliant husband.
His campaign makes Chef Romani as an American as apple pie.
Well, we like him.
But he is a naughty boy.
Come on, naughty boy.
Speak to me a few words in italiano.
I feel like getting homesick.
He speak so delicious.
Oblige him, Mr. Stephens.
Do it for me.
Signor Romani.
Listen how he speaks.
So beautiful.
So beautiful.
Why he denies he is italiano?
You tell me, Samantha, what province he comes from?
Would somebody tell me, please?
Somebody tell me.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
What are you doing?
I'm waiting to see the queen.
And who gave you permission to wait up here?
It's much too noisy down there.
I have to have it quiet when I'm practicing.
Want to hear the witch's anthem I've been working on?
- No.
- I'll be glad to.
What do you think of it so far?
That happens to be a direct steal from the Air Corps song.
Really?
And where do you think they got it?
Sam.
Something's up.
And I think it's Darrin.
What is that hippie doing upstairs?
For your information that is the proper dress of a 17th-century minstrel.
- Get rid of this mob.
- But we're not finished.
Are you planning to work on the church bazaar tomorrow?
- Of course.
- Then you're gonna need sleep.
Tell them to come back some other time.
You gonna tell them to clear out, or am I?
You better let me do it.
There's been grumbling about you interfering with the queen's business.
- It might turn into a roar.
- Yeah?
Well, vice versa.
I'm terribly sorry but I'm afraid I'm going to have to dissolve our session for this evening.
Why?
I will see you all at the earliest possible convenience.
At least your being queen has some benefit.
Honey.
Honey?
Who does he think he is?
I must say.
It isn't Samantha, it's Dumbo.
Her husband.
If we could only get rid of him.
Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I've just had a perfectly marvellous evil idea.
- And, and - Tell us.
Tell us.
- Come on.
Come on.
- What is it?
I've got something marvellous to tell you.
Honey.
You're not sore about last night, are you?
Well, I am the queen and I do have a responsibility to my subjects.
- Well, sure, but - And we did have an agreement.
I think agreements should be honoured.
You are sore.
- Will it help if I say I'm sorry?
- I am not sore, and yes, it'll help.
I'm sorry.
- Are you sure you have to go?
- Of course.
The bazaar opens tomorrow and there's loads of work to be done at the church.
I'm gonna be awful bored around here with nothing to do.
Fix the railing on the gazebo.
That'll keep you busy.
What, on my day off?
Serena?
Serena?
- Has dear cousin Samantha gone?
- She's just left.
- Now it's time to get to work.
- Oh, this is going to be a ball.
I'll bet it'll be more fun than the time I joined the Navy.
Serena, we are not here to have fun.
You're here to do a job.
Remember that.
Yes, but I always manage to combine business with pleasure.
Shall we go?
Just a few small details.
That's just perfect.
That's funny.
Mrs. Stephens drove away in her car and came back without it.
So what?
If you ask me, there's something mighty peculiar going on around here.
You're right, so why don't you stop going around?
Hi, honey.
What happened?
There were so many volunteers at the church we were getting in each other's way.
They asked me to come back tomorrow instead.
Sorry you weren't needed, but, boy, am I glad to have you back.
Come here and give us a kiss.
If you want a kiss, come and get it.
Okay.
Now, listen, S What's the big idea?
Have you flipped?
What's gotten into you?
Nothing.
I just didn't feel like being pawed.
Well, the next time you feel that way, a simple "leave me alone" will do.
You're still sore, aren't you?
Well, why shouldn't I be?
You humiliated me in front of my subjects.
I apologize.
Big deal.
I'll get it.
Sorry.
I wonder if I could borrow a cu Did you lose something?
Not yet, but I'm about to.
- Sugar?
- Yeah.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, I just wondered, what happened to your car?
Well, I have a question for you too.
What happened to your shoes?
One cup of sugar, coming up.
Did you see that?
See what?
- How am I doing?
- Oh, splendidly.
Just splendidly.
But don't go overboard.
Samantha's going to be away all day.
We have plenty of time, Serena.
Righto.
Well, I happened to be looking out my window when she drove away.
- And I happened to be looking out - Here you are, Mrs. Kravitz.
You're not going to leave without your shoes?
Oh, did you see the look on her face?
Was that a riot?
If you think that was a riot, listen to this.
Just a minute.
Sam, what is this?
What happened?
What about the basis for our marriage?
No witchcraft under any circumstances.
I never should've let you become queen.
But that's just the point.
I am the queen.
And it's made me realize how tired I am of this whole mortal charade.
Tired of toeing the line.
Your line.
Tired of jumping every time you bark.
I can't believe my ears.
That's because you hear only what you want to hear.
See only what you want to see, like all other human beings.
Now, if you had any vision you would realize that you've taken a wild, free spirit a spirit that was born to ride the wings of the wind and penned me up in this dreary, four-walled cage.
And furthermore, y Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What do you think you're doing?
- What's wrong?
- Didn't I tell you not to overdo it?
- Was I?
- Were you?
Serena, if we'd wanted Sarah Bernhardt, we'd have sent for her.
Now, you take it easy.
- Furthermore what?
- I refuse to discuss it any further until you have cooled off.
Until I cool off?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
This is fun, isn't it?
Somebody's idea of fun is not necessarily somebody else's idea of fun.
I beg your pardon?
It's a little late for that now.
Right in here, Larry.
Sit down, Larry.
What I wanna talk to you about is You've been married a lot longer than I have.
That is an unimpeachable fact, and I have the grey hairs to prove it.
Having a little problem with Samantha?
How did you know?
Intuition.
Something wrong?
Well, for one thing, she's not as affectionate as usual.
- How long have you been married?
- Almost four years.
Darrin let me explain something.
Women begin marriage in an atmosphere of compliance and willingness.
They cater to a man, make concessions to him, et cetera.
But slowly the bloom fades, and their patience begins to wear thin.
- So?
- So you've had four good years.
What more do you want?
- Is that all I get?
- Right.
Now you move into the stage where she thinks she's a queen.
Boy, have you hit the nail on the head.
But that's par for the course.
Darrin, you don't have any problem, believe me.
Larry will you do me a favour?
Will you talk to her?
See if you can find out what's bothering her.
All right.
But I really don't think you have a problem.
Thanks, Larry.
- Samantha!
- What is it?
Would you come here for a minute, honey?
Look who's here.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi.
You keep Larry company while I Yes.
You're looking lovely, as usual.
How?
How are you, Sam?
Fine.
Is everything going okay?
Everything's going perfectly.
Have I ever told you that I'm just wild about grey hair?
As a matter of fact I mean, you are?
I earned every one of them myself, you know.
I'm simply crazy about your sense of humour.
Well, it's Tell me, is everything okay between you and Darrin?
- Who?
Your husband.
Are your eyes hazel or grey, Harry?
It's Larry, and lay off him.
Why?
He's cute.
He's not your assignment, Serena.
Oh, Endora.
I never have any fun.
What were you saying?
My eyes.
They're baby blue.
- They certainly are.
- Yes.
And I think I'd better get going.
Nice to see you, Sam.
No, no, you just stay where you are, and l I know my way out.
Larry, did you talk to her?
Well, not much.
I mean, we talked a little.
- Did you get anything out of her?
- Yes.
But she didn't tell me anything.
Well, what did she say?
Darrin, I think you've got a little problem on your hands.
- Sam.
- Yes?
I'm nice and cool now.
Let's have that little talk.
About what?
This This thing that's come over you.
Could you be under a spell by any chance?
Maybe your mother, you know That's what you'd like to believe, isn't it?
Anything but face the truth.
Okay, Sam.
What is the truth?
That I'm tired of all your silly little mortal games.
That I am a witch and a queen.
And from now on, I'm gonna act like it.
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?
I'm convening the royal court.
Sam.
Sam, you can't do this in broad daylight.
We agreed.
Mortal agreements are not binding under witch's law.
These are my people, and I am their queen.
Well, this is my house, and I am the king.
Well, it's been nice knowing you too.
I hope he's gone for good.
Stop the music.
Stop the music.
Why are you celebrating?
He didn't take his clothes.
We still have work to do.
Endora, really.
And don't worry.
I'll replace the cup of sugar, even though you made me spill it.
- What?
- As a matter of fact it'll be waiting for you when you get home because I certainly don't want to be under any obligation to you.
Sam!
Come here.
- Oh, are you back?
- You bet I am.
Serena, it's getting late.
It's time to play our trump card.
All right.
Here I go.
And we're gonna sit right down and talk this What are you doing in that outfit?
- I'm going out to do some shopping.
- You are not.
Why not?
People will stare.
You'll attract attention.
So what?
Other men don't think I'm so bad to look at.
- But - You just better get used to it.
Because I am through with this dull life.
- Dull?
- Yes.
Dull, dull.
I'm sick of simmering like a watched pot.
I wanna get out and boil.
Sam, listen, you can't do this.
You're a wife and mother.
You want me to dress like a typical mortal housewife and mother?
Okay.
Now can I go shopping?
No, would you - I'll get it.
- Don't you dare.
You, get.
Go on.
Before somebody sees you looking like that.
Hi, Mr. Stephens.
Gladys called from the bazaar and asked me to bring this over.
- You didn't have to do that.
- That's what you think.
For some crazy reason, Gladys told Mrs. Stephens this would be waiting for her when she got home from the bazaar.
When Mrs. Stephens got home from the bazaar?
Look, take my advice, stay out of it.
Personally, I think the world of your wife.
Nice manners.
A fine lady.
And if you don't mind my saying so, one of the best-looking women I ever Hi.
Mrs. Stephens isn't feeling too well.
Neither am I. Excuse me.
He looked like he'd seen a ghost.
A ghost would look better than you do right now.
Excuse me, l I have to talk to Mr. Kravitz.
- When did you say your wife called?
- About five minutes ago.
And she said she wanted you to bring sugar over before my wife got home from the bazaar?
You see what I have to put up with?
Your wife isn't even at the bazaar.
I wouldn't be too quick to criticize Mrs. Kravitz.
It's finally beginning to sink in.
You see, she was telling the truth.
How could she be?
Your wife is right there in the house.
I just knew that couldn't be my wife.
- Are you feeling all right?
- I'm gonna feel fine as soon as I give a certain party a little of her own medicine.
Oh, yeah?
It wouldn't hurt to take some yourself.
I'll see you.
You were magnificent, Serena.
Oh, thank you.
I do think we've got him on the run.
Any minute we should hear him slamming out, suitcases in hand.
Serena.
Oh, are you gonna get it.
Samantha?
I hope we're not going to have another talk.
I think this is going to be a final Oh, no.
It's Samantha.
- Let's get out of here.
- No.
I planned for this contingency.
We'll simply say that we were testing Dumbo's love.
- That's good.
- Sam!
Sam?
- Sam, where are you?
- Right here.
Will you stop playing games?
Well, I'm glad to see you got yourself cleaned up.
Well, it was pretty dirty work.
You can say that again.
Come here.
Let's stop simmering and start boiling.
You all right?
What's the idea?
What's a friendly little pat between a husband and wife?
From now on, I'm locking the liquor cabinet.
- What's in the box?
- Your favourite pie.
I've a good mind not to give you any.
- Lemon meringue pie.
- Leave it alone, sweetheart.
This is like an answer to a prayer.
- It'll spoil your appetite.
- No, it won't, but it might spoil yours.
- What's that?
- Where?
There.
I hope that teaches you a lesson you never forget.
Darrin, I am going to give you three seconds to explain this lunacy and then I'm going to let you have it.
One, two, three.
- Well, how is it?
Good as usual?
- Delicious.
Now, let's play fair and let me have another one.
Gladly.
Oh, Darrin, please, don't.
Oh, please.
Darrin, I don't What is all this about?
As if you didn't know, you Wait a minute.
Does it have anything to do with Mother?
But it must have.
Why are you taking it out on me?
Mother!
Sorry, Endora.
I meant that for Serena.
Who, me?
You mean you're really?
And she?
Oh, Sam.
Sam, you probably thought I'd flipped.
Has she been here all day?
Pretending to be me?
Samantha, darling, it was all your mother's idea.
Sam, what can I say?
There's nothing to say.
Just get some spoons.
How do you like that, Serena?
Not bad.
She's right.
It is tasty.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
I'll get it.
I said I'd get it.
Will you open it?
Darrin, why don't you finish breakfast.
Open it.
All right.
Thank you.
Aren't you afraid your breakfast will get cold?
No, because I finished it.
What have you got there?
Sweetheart, now, I know how you've been saying we should try and hold down expenses right now, but this was an incredible bargain.
Honey, as long as it's something you need, it's perfectly okay.
- What is it?
- As a matter of fact it was a steal.
And if you don't like it, I can take it back.
Sam, why the big fuss?
Have I ever denied you anything?
I mean, anything within reason?
Now, you make it sound as if I were some sort of cheap - I'll take it back.
- Oh, no!
I was just a little surprised, because Is that the coat we saw in the store last week?
Yes.
Now, Darrin, I know you thought it was awfully expensive but it was marked way down.
To what?
Hundred and sixty dollars.
- I'll take it back.
- Oh, don't be silly.
I realize that with just a little you could zap up the most beautiful coat in the world.
The fact that you found this bargain is It's gratifying.
Then you don't think I should've bought it?
Well, I think you should've talked to me first.
- I'll take it back.
- Do what you want.
Either way, do you mind if I go to work so I can pay for the darn thing?
Darrin, you have to tell me whether I should take it back or not.
- I told you to keep it.
- I'll take it back.
Well, goodbye.
Mother, put that down.
Not until I put him down.
To think that you, my daughter whose cloak should be mantles of moonbeams reduced to haggling with a full-time cheapskate over a ratty little coat.
It just so happens that this trim is the finest tourmaline mink.
And Darrin is not a cheapskate.
He's just careful.
That's right.
He's a careful cheapskate.
Mother, it isn't that I don't adore hearing you rant and rave but would you mind doing it somewhere else?
Somewhere else Is where I'll do it And when I do it 'Tis you who'll rue it You'll see dumbo In his true light You won't believe He could be so tight Good morning, Darrin.
Boy, have I got a surprise for you.
We got the Bigelow Tire account, and guess who's going to handle it.
Me?
- What's wrong with it?
- Now, Darrin, is that fair?
Even though I'm the boss haven't I carried my share of problem accounts?
Sure you have, Lar.
Right up till the time they become problems.
Lucky for you I know you're kidding.
Right?
Right.
Mr. Bigelow's coming up later this morning.
- Yes?
- Mrs. Stephens on one.
Thanks, Betty.
I'm going.
I'll buzz you when he gets here.
Hi, Sam.
Sweetheart, about the coat, I just wanted you to know you had every right to be annoyed.
Wait a minute, honey.
I was not annoyed.
You could've fooled me.
Anyway, I'm gonna take it back.
No, Sam, I want you to keep it.
If I seemed the least bit negative, it was only because Well, I wanted this to be a surprise, but I might as well tell you.
Tell me what?
Darrin?
Monty, morey, newt and pok e On his head this spell inv ok e Up from the depths Where it lies sleeping The miser in him must now Come leaping That's a lot of money for something that's not necessary.
- What?
- And money doesn't grow on trees.
But just a moment ago you said I could keep it.
So what?
A moment ago, you said you were going to take it back.
Now, Sam, I've got a lot of work to do.
And time is money, you know.
Well, I won't take up any more of your money.
Goodbye.
A penny for your thoughts.
And I know you can use the cash.
All the world loves a funny witch.
What did what's-his-name have to say?
Darrin?
Well, he thought Yes?
- How'd you know it was him?
- Oh, just intuition.
- What was on his little mind?
- Nothing.
Same as usual, eh?
What?
What have you decided to do about this?
You know, Mother, you were right.
It is kind of ratty.
I think I'll take it back.
Betty, get this in the mail right away, please.
Yes, sir.
Betty.
What do you see on this envelope?
- Your name.
- And what else?
- Nothing.
- Exactly.
Then why did you discard it?
- Why - Betty the reason they put lines on these envelopes is so you can you use them over and over and over again.
Envelopes don't grow on trees, you know.
- I'm sorry, I didn't realize - While we're on the subject the next time you remove pages from my calendar don't throw them away.
- What should I do with them?
Use them.
See?
It's blank.
Makes perfectly good scratch paper.
- Multiply the calendar pads by 300 - Yes?
Ask Mr. Stephens to come in.
Mr. Bigelow's here.
Be right there, Larry.
Let's get on the ball, Betty, before it's too late.
Yes, sir.
No, I won't cry.
He'll say I'm wasting water.
Now, let me make something quite clear, Stephens.
I've got 10 million dollars in the bank.
And the way I got it there was by refusing to make any useless expenditures.
The minute you spend one unnecessary dollar, you're through.
And I'd deserve to be, Mr. Bigelow because there's no greater crime than spending money unnecessarily.
You know, I think we're gonna get along all right.
Stephens is right.
But on the other hand, you have to spend money to make money.
You're only saying that, Larry, because we're in advertising where we take 15 percent off the top.
Did I tell you, Mr. Bigelow?
This boy is the kind you can't buy.
Honest, open, fearless.
- Cigar bother you?
- No, no.
Here.
Care for one?
Oh, yes, thanks.
You know, you wouldn't believe it if I told you how little I pay for these cigars.
I get them directly from the maker.
I'll put this up against any Really?
I'd like to get some.
Well, I can give you his name.
Jose Ortega.
- 1555 Bleeker Street, apartment four.
- Thank you.
Here, have another for later.
- Thanks.
- Mr. Bigelow Stephens will get to work immediately on the new layouts.
Meanwhile, I've had the art department redo some of your previous ads to give you an idea of our approach.
- Wait a minute.
I didn't request it.
It's been done at our own expense.
Well, let's look at it, by all means.
It just occurs to me.
Tires are black-and-white.
There's no need to go to the added expense of a four-colour process.
Good thinking.
How do you like that for integrity?
Isn't he something?
All he cares about is cutting down the costs for the client no matter what it costs us.
Darrin, my boy, why don't we just step into your office and let Mr. Bigelow here examine this stuff at his own tempo.
- What are you trying to do, Darrin?
- What do you mean?
That cheap act you're putting on is great.
But what good is it if you blow the deal?
Larry, I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, come off it, Darrin.
You heard Bigelow was a tightwad and you're trying to humour him.
Which is a great approach, don't misunderstand me.
And when you actually took one of those horrible cigars I considered it an act of personal heroism.
I can still taste them.
You didn't even smoke one.
You don't have to smoke one of those cigars to taste them.
I better get back to Bigelow.
What are you writing in that book?
I'm simply recording the fact that you owe me 3 cents.
What?
A penny for the gum, Sam?
Sam?
- Hi, sweetheart.
- You left the outside light on.
Of course, so you could see your way in from the garage.
I always do.
Well, between the time you turned it on and I got home, you wasted an awful lot of electricity.
It might be worth installing a switch so the light can be turned on from the garage.
Well, why be so extravagant?
You drive your car into the garage and honk your horn say, three times.
I'll allow a few seconds for you to get out of the car.
And then I'll turn on the outside light.
You can joke if you want to.
But electricity doesn't grow on trees, you know.
That's right.
It grows on telephone poles.
It's awfully bright in here.
Darrin, I get the message, but why are you so concerned over a few cents' worth of electricity?
A few cents here, a few cents there.
It all mounts up.
And Sam, we've got to do something about saving money around here.
Well, I think I did my share today.
I took the coat back.
You did?
Oh, that's great.
Oh, yes, that should be quite a saving.
Well, if it makes you that happy I ought to buy more things and return them.
Sam, do we need a 100-watt bulb in there?
Forgive me for changing the subject, but how was your day?
I've been meaning to tell you.
I got a new account today.
Bigelow Tires.
The client and I just seemed to hit it off.
Like we had something in common.
Oh, well, sweetheart, l Well, I just can't tell you how thrilled I am.
Thank you.
You know, I was thinking of having Mr. Bigelow and his wife over to dinner.
Larry and Louise too, of course.
Why, yes, of course, sweetheart, any time, if you Where did you get that?
This cigar?
That's what it is?
Bigelow.
Would you believe they cost under a nickel apiece?
That much?
Only if you buy them from the maker.
Darrin, your Mr. Bigelow sounds like a terrible cheapskate.
Samantha, I don't appreciate you criticizing somebody that I happen to admire.
If you don't mind, I'll change the subject.
What's for dinner?
Steak and asparagus with hollandaise sauce.
- Oh, I better check the sauce.
- Wait a minute.
What happened to yesterday's spaghetti?
- I threw it out.
- You what?
Sam, that's an inexcusable waste.
But you hate leftovers.
There's nothing wrong with leftovers.
In fact, I prefer them.
Well, all right.
From now on, we'll have nothing but leftovers if I can just figure out what they'll be left over from.
You've just given me a great idea for a new product.
- What's that?
- Canned leftovers.
Lie down, sweetheart, you've been overworking.
I'll call you when dinner's ready.
Oh, boy.
Hey.
Sorry.
I didn't realize you were in here.
Where did you think I was cooking, in the garage?
It's curdled.
That makes two of us.
- I'll just have to throw it away.
- Are you kidding?
I love curdles.
Darrin, what's gotten into you?
You nev Mother.
Mother's been at it again.
At what again?
She's turned you into a terrible cheapskate.
I beg your pardon.
In what way have I been cheap?
Listen, do you think tomorrow night's too soon to ask Mr. Bigelow and his wife to dinner?
Oh, no, I don't think so.
From what you've told me, I'm sure he'd jump at the offer of a free meal.
You're right.
I know I would.
I'll call him from the office tomorrow.
What do you suggest I serve?
Veal birds?
What are veal birds?
Fake chicken legs on a stick made of ground-up veal.
Hey, that might be kind of novel.
And it's inexpensive?
- And cheap.
- Sounds perfect.
I was only kidding.
Although in your condition, I should know better than to risk it.
I certainly am glad you can come, Mr. Bigelow.
I hope you don't feel I was too presumptuous in asking you.
After all, we just met yesterday.
It was an important meeting for me.
It was like meeting a kindred spirit.
Oh, well, you don't have to do that.
But if you insist on bringing some wine, there'll be six of us.
Yes, a gallon should be plenty.
Everything okay?
They'll be here any minute.
- I'm practically set.
- How are the veal birds doing?
That's funny.
They look just like prime rib.
- It is a prime rib.
- Darrin, don't you understand?
- This is a business dinner.
Now, you - Of course.
Business dinner.
Split the cost of the prime rib with Larry.
- That's good thinking, Sam.
- Darrin, don't you dare ask Larry to!
I'll get it.
Mother?
Mother, I'm gonna make one last appeal to you before this evening turns into a disaster.
Now, you come back here immediately and take that spell off.
Well, there's nothing to do but try and remove it myself.
Which is half foolish and half useless.
But I'm desperate.
Come right in.
How are you, Mr. Bigelow?
And this must be Mrs. Bigelow.
How do you do?
Very nice to meet you.
- Let me take your things.
- Thank you.
- You know Mr. And Mrs. Tate.
- Oh, yes, we drove up together.
- It was perfect timing.
Where's Sam?
- Sam?
My, what a lovely home.
Thanks very much.
Won't you sit down?
Creepy cheapie Tak e a chance On a triple dose Of extravagance We should move to the country, dear.
The commuting gets expensive, doesn't it, Stephens?
Yes, it does.
I've been thinking of organizing a car pool.
Good idea.
Sam?
This is my wife.
Mr. And Mrs. Bigelow.
- How do you do?
- Mr. Bigelow, Mrs. Bigelow.
- How do you do?
- Samantha.
- Hi, Sam.
- Oh, hi, La Oh, I'm sorry.
Cigar bother you?
Oh, no.
No, I love the smell of a good cigar.
Well, I wish I had one.
This is awful.
That's what I've been trying to tell you for 20 years.
I love them.
I'm gonna order some.
If you do, you're crazy.
But But they're so cheap.
Look, you get what you pay for.
If you haven't learned that, you don't know a thing.
Darrin, how about some drinks before dinner?
Good idea.
You get the glasses, I'll pour the wine.
Mrs. Stephens, that roast was sheer delight.
I haven't had prime rib in years.
- Oh, doctor's orders?
- No, banker's.
We ought to have prime rib once in a while.
Well, yes, dear.
I'll start saving.
Have one of these coronas.
Why, thank you.
Aren't those awfully expensive?
Two dollars apiece.
Two dollars!
Well, if you want the best, you gotta pay for it.
Dear, are you sure you wouldn't like a bromide?
No, of course not.
Oh, incidentally what would you think of the Andy Douglas Show for Bigelow Tires?
I hear they're shopping for a sponsor.
Oh, Mr. Bigelow in the presentation I'm preparing, I recommend that you buy a show called Spot the Place.
It's a game show.
And it's a much better buy on a cost per thousand.
I'm not interested in a better buy.
I like the Andy Douglas Show.
- That'll cost you a fortune.
- Yes.
Besides, if you wanna make money, you've gotta spend money, right?
Tate, I wanna talk about my account and how it's going to be handled.
And who's going to handle it.
Excuse me.
There's something I have to remove.
From the stove?
Not exactly.
I don't know what's gotten into my husband but I hope it never wears off.
I thought you had to do something, Samantha.
I'll do it later if it isn't too late.
As far as I'm concerned Andy Douglas is a funny, funny man.
- One of the funniest.
- At those prices, he better be.
- But at the same time, he's warm.
- One of the warmest.
The emcee of this game show is warm and cheap.
I'll never forget the benefit Andy did for the League for Animal Assistance.
I'm chairman of their annual fund drive, you know.
Is that right?
You know, that's a great charity.
I've always admired the work they do.
You have?
How much can I put you down for?
Well, naturally, I have my own charities but I'd be glad to give a token contribution.
Well, every little bit helps, you know.
Put you down for 5?
Fine.
Stephens, how about you?
Perhaps you'd care to give something.
Mr. Bigelow, I hope you're not going to misunderstand this.
Charities are all well and good Well.
Well, what took you so long?
I guess things did get a little out of hand, didn't they?
A lit?
Mother, I'll never forgive you.
But I'll think it over if you take that spell off Darrin this instant.
All right.
Weebus, wallabus Teetle bell The time has come To alter the spell Rumbus, reebus Apple pan soak The spell I wove I now rev ok e I wish I had said that.
Mother, wait a minute.
Okay.
- And I think your charity is one of the best.
So you can put me down for the same amount as Larry.
Well, thank you, gentlemen.
That's very generous of you.
Tate, 5.
Stephens, 5.
You know, 1000 dollars goes a long way for a stray dog or cat.
It goes a long way for a human too.
I tell you, I've never seen a change come over a man like that.
Have you?
Once in a while.
Mrs. Bigelow certainly left here on a cloud, didn't she?
Yeah.
I'm not even going to say I'm mad at your mother because that would be the understatement of the year.
- Would you get the cups, please?
- Yeah.
If she ever tries anything like that again, I'll You'll what?
If you're trying to show me how small you feel because of what you did forget it.
You'll - Darrin.
Darrin, don't let her size fool you.
There's nothing small about her powers.
- What are you doing in there?
- Resting, darling.
Oddly enough, I'm glad you're here.
Putting that spell on me was bad enough but taking it off when you did was really rotten timing.
Oh, don't make such a fuss.
You know as well as I do that that 500 dollars is tax-deducible or whatever you people call it.
That's not the point.
Now I don't know if I can afford the gift I bought you.
You bought me something?
What is it?
Let me see.
Don't peek.
If he's giving something this I have to see.
Oh, Mother, stop it.
Oh, Darrin!
No wonder you acted so funny about the one I bought.
Well, naturally, I was a little disappointed.
- Well, why didn't you tell me?
- I was going to when something came over me.
- Mother?
- What?
You ready to say uncle?
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Rise and shine.
Oh, did I oversleep?
Six-thirty?
And all is well.
Voilà.
What's all this?
What are you doing up so early?
A toast.
To the new anti-smog device manufactured by Carter Brothers Industrial Products.
More specifically to the brilliant young fellow who designed their advertising campaign.
They bought it!
Yeah.
I couldn't wait to tell you.
Oh, sit down and tell me all the details.
Unless, of course, you're too modest.
You twisted my arm.
What did Mr. Carter say?
Well, among other things, I was called an advertising genius.
I'm so proud of you.
Honey, everyone was.
It's a deal that's good for everyone.
Everything went so smoothly, right from the start.
It was like magic.
Sam, you didn't by any chance?
No, Darrin, you did it all yourself.
You are a brilliant advertising man.
I have one fault.
Your modesty.
And I want you to go down today and purchase two tickets for that cruise to Bermuda.
- You mean it?
- Larry said a big bonus.
Oh, Darrin, it'll be like a second honeymoon.
- Nothing wrong with the first.
- True.
I'd better get to the office.
Larry's ready to burn incense at my feet.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Congratulations.
Thanks, hon.
Morning, Mommy.
Good morning, sweetheart.
- Daddy go?
- Yes, just left.
Daddy didn't go.
Darrin!
Darrin?
Darrin, you forgot your briefca Tabatha, no!
Oh, Tabatha.
Crick ery crock ery heed my wishes Reassemble into dishes Oh, my stars!
Bach or "Road to Mandalay" I command you, piano, to play "Melancholy Baby"?
Mother!
Mother!
Mom?
I command with all my might This wretched lighter now to light Oh, thank heavens you heard me.
- You called me?
- Mother, don't joke.
Well, I merely popped in to see my grandchild.
Well, your "child" child is glad you're here.
Mother, I've lost my powers.
Watch.
Dwindling kindling, earn my praise Fire burn with cheery blaze There, now do you believe me?
Oh, darling, forgive the cynicism.
- I'll call Dr. Bombay.
- Good.
Endora, I've asked you a thousand times to call me at the exchange.
I was at a concert.
- In that getup?
- Quite appropriate, I assure you.
Nero was fiddling, Rome was burning.
It was a smasheroo.
- A reenactment, of course.
- Of course.
And I'm very sorry.
But this is an emergency.
Samantha has lost her zap.
Good.
Wouldn't have lasted anyway.
These mixed marriages Not "sap," "zap".
Oh, sorry.
Stick your tongue out.
Gladly.
Say "ah".
Is it serious?
When did you fly last?
Well, I can't remember.
I've been very busy.
Let me see you try simple self-levitation.
The tongue depressor, levitate it.
Have you been practicing your normal day-to-day witchcraft?
Well Don't tell me because you're married to one you've been trying to live like one.
- Sad, but true.
- Mother.
My dear girl, you haven't lost your powers they're simply clogged up.
Such neglect of her metaphysics has rendered her earthbound.
- Earthbound?
- My dear, there's no need to panic.
But simple levitation is urgent in order to prevent the dam from bursting.
Mother!
And you stay there, young lady.
But I can't stay up here, I've got things to do.
Quiet.
If you need me, call.
Through the exchange.
Now you just rest.
We'll have you back on your feet in no time.
Rest?
Up here?
- Levitation is the only cure.
- How long?
Well, Samantha, Rome was neither built nor burned in a day.
Rome didn't have a child to take care of or a house to clean.
Grandmama will take care of little Tabatha.
As for the house you can take care of that yourself when you get better.
Larry, I don't wanna put my feet on your desk.
You don't like my desk?
I love your desk.
I'm crazy about your desk.
It's yours.
You're a genius.
"Inhale in Health".
Oh, are we gonna fill our lungs full of that fresh, clean money.
Darrin, you really earned your bonus this time.
After Nilesmunster signs the contract, I'll sign your bonus check.
- Nilesmunster?
- M.J. Nilesmunster.
The guy Carter sent to give the contract the final once-over.
- You know him?
- I went to school with a Nilesmunster.
Well, if this is a guy you went to school with This was a girl.
- Who was a girl?
- Mary Jane Nilesmunster.
What's the matter with you?
You know that feeling when you get up in the morning the sun is shining, and the birds are singing so nice and you fall down the whole flight of stairs splat on your face?
What are you talking about?
Mary Jane Nilesmunster swore she'd get me someday and knowing her, she might pick this day to do it.
Now, look, Darrin I know how important this deal is to you me too but let's not get paranoid.
M.J. Nilesmunster represents one of the top manufacturers of the country.
They're up on the big board.
M.J. Can't be Mary Jane.
You're right, Larry.
I'm being silly.
- Of course you are.
- I just want everything to work out.
You know me, I'm a walking ulcer.
Do I look worried?
- Any word from Nilesmunster yet?
- The plane arrived on schedule.
- The appointment was for 2:00?
- Yes, Mr. Tate.
Did you speak to Nilesmunster directly?
No, Mr. Stephens.
She was under the dryer.
Larry, please.
Tell her I'm sick.
Tell her I died.
She's waiting to pull the rug out from under me.
She particularly requested that you be there.
You know why?
She wants to see the look on my face when she says, "No deal".
Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.
So that's it.
Take it from an old hand, they forget.
You don't know Mary Jane.
So long, Larry.
You should see what she wrote in the yearbook.
"Roses are red, violets are blue.
It may take a while, but I'll get you".
Pinning a girl at prom doesn't mean you're gonna marry her.
I know that but her mother broadcast the engagement all over the state.
- On the radio?
- Her mother didn't need a radio.
I've been through it a hundred times.
By now, to her, you're just another face.
Not with her memory.
She could recite both senators from every state.
Don't make me say it, Darrin.
- Say what?
- You're just not that memorable.
You're a little guilty.
Tell Sam about it and get it off your chest.
- Good idea, I'll go call her.
- Not now.
It's open.
I'm on long distance.
Make yourselves at home.
That's her.
Mr. Tate, could you come in for a second?
Mr. Carter wants to speak to you.
- Right.
Mr. Stephens too?
- Just you.
What'd I tell you?
- Hello.
- Thank goodness I caught you.
I hope you haven't picked up those tickets to Bermuda.
Well, no, sweetheart.
As a matter of fact, I haven't.
- What's wrong?
- I'll explain later.
Something happened to shake up this deal.
Oh, darling, I am sorry.
- Where are you now?
- At the hotel.
Well, don't you worry, darling.
We can manage without Samantha, the less contact with humans, in your condition, the better!
Samantha can't talk to you anymore.
You!
Would you put Samantha back on the phone.
She's indisposed.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- She's flying.
- Flying?
- I didn't expect you to understand.
- Mother.
- Yes?
That was a terrible thing to do, even for you.
You calm yourself.
You're not at all well.
Flying?
Flying?
!
Sam.
Sam, is that you?
You didn't have to come all the way down here, honey.
A trip to Bermuda can't mean that much to you.
Sam.
Sam!
Sam, please.
Go home!
There'll be other deals, other trips to Bermuda, I promise.
Sam!
Sam?
Honey?
Besides, there's nothing you could do, even if I wanted you to.
Sam, please, go home!
Sam, please.
Please, Samantha.
Please?
Go home.
Mother, you work at trying not to understand.
I know how much this deal means to Darrin.
He needs help.
I've always said that.
Be serious.
Darrin is in some kind of trouble and he needs help.
He'd never ask.
If he was going to ask, he'd probably do it by not asking.
- Don't you see?
- Oh, yes.
It's marvellously clear.
This is a fine time for my powers to get clogged up.
Samantha, I learned something very important a long time ago.
When a man asks for help from a woman especially by not asking for help the best thing for her to do is to forget about the whole thing.
- You sure?
- Dead certain.
Where'd you learn that?
From the Wicked Witch of the West?
No, from a divorce lawyer in Southern California.
Oh, Samantha!
Really!
Sam, please, go home.
I don't want your help.
Whatever you do, I'll undo, so you just might as well go on home.
You're wasting your time.
Besides, I don't like the idea of your mother sitting with the ba by.
Ladybug, ladybug, fly away home.
- That's a fly.
- It is?
I'd better have the old optics checked.
Larry!
A life.
After all, a fly has as much right to live as a This is Darrin Stephens, Miss Nilesmunster.
- How do you?
- I just wanted to say that things in the past have no bearing on things going on right now.
How do you do, Mr. Stephens?
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
How do you do?
Well, Stephens, shall we get to the contract?
Miss Nilesmunster, before you sign, there's something you should know.
You're being dealt with unfairly.
You see, a long time ago, we knew each other, but you forgot.
But you didn't really forget.
That is The point is, you know me, but you don't know that you know me.
It's a spell!
Darrin, Miss Nilesmunster is a very busy woman and I don't think we should delay her any longer than we have to.
Thank you very much, gentlemen.
Thank you very much, Miss Nilesmunster.
What did I tell you?
Oh, Mother, there's Darrin now.
Please let me down.
If you want to get back in shape, you'll stay off your feet.
But he's never been this late.
Mother, I'm worried.
You know what may happen.
Just let me down!
Good evening, Samantha.
- Good evening, madam.
- Darrin.
Don't you recognize me either?
- What's wrong?
- He's soused to the gills, that's what.
Mother, please.
Nonsense, madam.
I'm quite sober.
I had only ti martoonis.
Then take the olives out of your mouth.
You're talking funny.
Funny is better than dreary.
Would you ask Little Miss Muffet to get her tuffet out of here?
All right.
But if you need me just light a match near his breath.
I'll see the flames.
Good old Smokey the Bore.
Darrin, what is it?
Did the deal fall through?
You know darn well the deal didn't fall through.
Well, now, how would I know a thing like that?
When you called this afternoon, I figured something was wrong.
And so you right away: - I what?
- You: I told you I didn't need your help.
But, no, you're the cavalry.
You're zaphappy, that's what you are.
All right, now, one step at a time.
The deal didn't fall through, and you're mad at me.
Listen, when you landed on my nose, I told you right then Wait, when I landed on your nose?
Sammy, you're not going to deny that you turned yourself into a fly and flew down to the hotel and zapped yourself into a two-week cruise to Bermuda?
You know something funny?
I don't understand one word you're saying.
I haven't left this house all day.
There is nothing worse than a flying lie!
A lying fly.
Your own mother said you were flying.
Right here!
And for therapy, if you wanna know.
I couldn't have changed myself into anything even if I wanted to.
- You couldn't?
- No.
And you know why?
Because I've lost my powers.
They're all dammed up.
And if I don't take care of myself, the dam will burst.
- I won't be able to control it - She didn't even recognize me.
Oh, sweetheart, you're not even listening.
Come back.
No power, huh?
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
When it comes back, it's out of control.
Wouldn't it be better if you admitted the truth?
The truth is that I haven't done anything.
I've been absolutely powerless all day.
I've been trying to get the piano to play, the fire to burn, the lighter to light Oh, Darrin, it isn't me.
Well, I mean, it is, but that's because the dam's burst.
Sam, turn that piano off.
This is a madhouse.
But I can't control it.
I'm warning you, Sam.
I'm gonna have to get out of here.
It's been a rough day.
All right, then.
Go back to your friendly bartender with your mouth full of olives!
Well, what'll it be old buddy?
On the rocks?
I always make them 5-to-1.
A man loses his integrity, he has nothing.
- I'll drink to that.
- Bartender.
- I'll drink to that.
- Keep the change.
I'll drink to that.
You're a married man, you don't have to put up with all the That I won't drink to.
Drink from, yes.
To, no.
My own wife, she had to interfere.
- They're all the same.
- No, they're not, yours is human.
I'd like to take a vote on that.
- Mine's a witch.
- They all are.
- She changed herself into a fly.
- They all change.
Starts out with, "Anything you say, dear," and then But she's not gonna get away with it.
If we go to Bermuda, it's gonna be on my credentials, not on her: Yes, sir.
I'm gonna put a whammy on her hocus-pocus right now.
- You better lay off.
- I'll drink to I recognized you this afternoon.
Oh, people change.
Now, on second look - What did you say?
- I said, I recognized you, Darrin.
When I heard the name, I wondered but the minute I laid eyes on you, I knew.
Then why?
Well, the last time I saw you, I was very upset.
I threatened childishly.
Let's just say, I prefer not to remember that hysterical, vengeful girl.
I guess you thought I was pretty dense.
I admit, it did cross my mind.
Will you please accept my apology?
It's a deal.
Our second today.
Well, I certainly am happy everything worked out.
I think we all are.
Well, you certainly have come a long way.
I mean, from drum majorette to I mean, you hold a very important position in the business world.
For a woman, you mean?
Oh, it's all right.
Ladies who work in what's considered a man's job get used to that.
I suppose.
What we don't get used to is keeping up in the business world and taking care of our children at the same time.
- You're married?
- Very.
- But "Nilesmunster"?
- That's the name on my law degree.
- Are you married?
- Yes, I'm married.
- Do you remember?
- Whatever happened?
- I'm sorry, go ahead.
- No, you.
I was wondering if you knew what happened to that Wilson brat that used to drive you cuckoo?
- Harvey Wilson?
- Harvey.
I never knew his first name.
We used to call him Stinky.
- That's who I'm married to.
- Wonderful guy.
Well, I'd better get going.
Come on, Sam.
It was stupid male pride.
That's the reason I acted the way I did.
You didn't believe me, that's what hurt.
I'm sorry.
Well, what is a marriage if it isn't based on trust?
You're right.
I'm not a liar.
Honey, I promise I'll never doubt you again.
Forgiven?
Just one more question.
A fly?
Now, don't you think I have more imagination than that?
Yes.
I told you it was just stupid male pride.
Okay.
You're forgiven.
One question.
Is this any way to run a marriage?
Well I mean, how long are you gonna have to stay like this?
Tonight should do it.
Well I guess we can make up tomorrow night.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Just a half a cup, honey.
I won't have time for a full cup.
Should be light in 15 minutes.
I'm gonna be out on the driving range.
Darrin, aren't you overdoing this a little?
I mean, what can you possibly expect to see by the dawn's early light outside of a flag?
Lt'll just be a couple of more days until Larry and I play with Joe Baxter.
I want to make a good impression.
After we play, then I'll relax.
Well, that'll Darrin?
Darrin?
Oh, Prince Charming.
He's a barrel of jollies, isn't he?
Mother, what are you doing here?
Darling, the Rajah of Ramapore is having those marvellous elephant races today and I asked the old dear if I could bring you.
- Mother, we are going nowhere.
- What a drudge.
Thank you.
What's with what's-his-name?
I know he was born tired, but why is he exhausted?
Well, he's after a very big account, a sporting-goods company.
And the president of the company is an excellent golfer.
And if Darrin makes a good showing on the golf course he gets the account.
Oh, you're joshing.
- It's not really as silly as it sounds.
- Oh, I do hope not.
Darrin was a very good golfer in his college days.
All he wants to do is get his old game back and he'll be happy.
You silly little witch.
Don't you know how it is with mortals and games?
They're never satisfied.
They get a little better, they want to get a lot better.
They get a lot better, they play all the time.
Soon he'll be living at the golf course.
Which, I guess, is a good deal better than living here.
Mother, the elephants are in the starting gate.
Hadn't you better get back to India?
Goodbye, Mother.
Darrin.
Eye of newt and scale of fish Give this mortal his stupid wish Let those clubs achieve his aim Give him back his college game Darrin?
Fore!
- Do you mind if I play through?
- Oh, no, go ahead.
No.
What?
I gotta go.
I can get in two buckets of balls and a fast nine holes before I go to the office.
You know, Sam, it really doesn't hurt getting up early.
- It doesn't?
- No, it makes you feel great.
Sharp, alert.
Goodbye, honey.
Darrin, you forgot something.
I'm sorry, honey, I didn't kiss you, did I?
Bye.
I know you feel sharp and alert, sweetheart but you still can't play golf without your clubs.
Yeah.
- Hello.
- Honey, I got it.
My game came back to me.
The rhythm, the swing, everything.
Well, congratulations.
I knew you could do it.
I told you.
Just a little time, patience.
You can relax a little now, huh?
Are you kidding?
Now I really gotta pour it on.
But, Darrin, you said all you wanted was Honey, I can't let up now.
A, I gotta get ready for Baxter and B, there's no reason why I can't be club champion.
And C, I'll send your pyjamas to the club so that you can sleep in the locker room.
Hey, honey, what do you take me for?
Some kind of a nut?
I'm sorry, sir.
I can neither confirm nor deny.
Well, honey, I'll talk to you later.
Darrin, you're late.
Now, where have you been?
Out swinging for the old company.
Oh, Larry, I've got it.
I shot a 38 on the first nine.
A 38, buddy boy.
I had one out of bounds and rimmed the cup on two greens.
Great.
Baxter's in my office.
We've been waiting for you.
I should have shot a 34.
You know that par 5 on the back nine?
Out there 260 yards.
I took out the 3-wood and crack.
On the green, putting for an eagle.
Yeah, that's fine, Darrin I played it with a break to the left broke straight in, so I tapped in for a birdie.
Next hole Darrin, I wanted you to sharpen up your game, but this is ridiculous.
You never were any good so you wouldn't understand.
That great feeling, that surge of power.
All right, Darrin.
Come along quietly.
Don't you wanna hear about the 15th hole?
It was great.
Joe, I'd like you to meet Joe?
Well, where'd he go?
Just loosening up a little.
Joe, I'd like you to meet my associate, Darrin Stephens.
Hey, quite a grip you got there, fella.
Not like our friend Flabby Larry here, huh?
I make a point of keeping myself in condition.
He's the brawn.
I'm the brains.
That doesn't necessarily follow.
It takes muscle to pump oxygen and vitamins to the brain cells to clean them up.
I think Joe's trying to tell you you've got a dirty mind.
Maybe not dirty, but certainly clogged up.
Right, Darrin?
Well, can we get down to business?
Now, Joe, about that account.
I'm very anxious to get started.
- All in good time.
I have read the brochures, seen the presentation.
Very creative.
But I don't feel that I know the real man until I've played golf with him.
I learn a lot about a man that way.
Especially when I beat him, which is usually.
I intend to give you a good run for your money, Joe.
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.
We're both planning to learn a lot from watching you play, Joe.
Why don't you bring your wives and join Mrs. Baxter and me for lunch at the club tomorrow before the game.
It'll be our pleasure.
My wife won't be able to make it.
She's visiting her mother.
Oh, your mother-in-law's sick?
You have no idea.
Well, see you at the club tomorrow at 12:30 for lunch.
Good.
It's a custom of mine.
Fattening up my victims before I lead them to slaughter.
- See you tomorrow, Joe.
- Right.
- Twelve-thirty, right?
- Right.
Bye-bye.
Darrin?
You're not going to do something stupid like try to beat Joe Baxter?
Larry, you're the one who's been bugging me to get my game up.
All right.
Just don't overdo it.
Well, there's time yet for two more plays.
We were two points behind.
Tough spot for a quarterback, which is me.
Now, this is the way we were lined up.
- Here I am.
- Substitution.
You should be the pepper, Mr. Baxter.
Well, I like that.
Thank you, Samantha.
Well, I called for a pass play, green, J5, out 6.
I got a bad pass from centre.
By the time I got control of the ball, my receivers were covered and they were coming in on me.
Gee, Joe, what happened?
Come on, what'd you do?
It was the last play the last game of my senior year at Poly Prep.
We were two points behind, but we won.
- How did I do it?
- I know.
I know.
Can I tell?
I got myself loose, I faded back - Are you ready for this?
- He drop-kicked it.
How about that?
Thanks, Margaret, for helping out.
I'd forgotten how the story ended.
Anyway, to me, a sport, any sport is what I call a dramatization of life.
That's a good thought, Joe.
A deep one.
Maybe we could use it in our advertising campaign.
Now, just a minute, amigo.
We don't have a deal yet.
- I think it's about time for us to tee off.
- Oh, we've got another minute.
Did I tell you what happened to me once with Sam Snead?
Joe, please.
Just go and play, will you?
All right, Margaret.
Well, enjoy yourselves, ladies.
We'll see you later.
- Good luck, sweetheart.
- Thanks.
Bye-bye.
Well, Samantha, what do you think of Joe's philosophy of sports?
- His enthusiasm is amazing.
- So is his vocabulary.
Men do tend to run with the conversational ball, don't they?
And I think it's a good idea every once in a while to throw them for a 10- or 15-yard loss.
You know the trouble with Joe?
He really is as good as he says he is.
If only he could be beaten by some Sunday golfer maybe we'd have a little more normalcy in our lives.
There'd be a scream of anguish heard round the world but it would do him and me a lot of good.
How about that, Joe.
I never thought I'd take a single hole from you yet here we are on the 11 th tee, and I'm only three down.
- Your honour, Stephens.
- Oh, yeah.
It was that 5-iron shot that did it.
I had to hit down on the ball, give it plenty of backspin so it would hold the green, yet I had to clear that tree.
We know.
We played the hole with you, remember?
I know, I know.
I just can't help bubbling over with Darrin.
Do you mind not bubbling over on us?
Sorry, Larry.
Next customer.
You're playing over your head.
Now, cut it out.
It's bugging Baxter.
Come on.
Baxter likes a good game.
He respects a fierce competitor.
Only if he wins.
See that he does.
I like that one.
Hi, fellas.
We're gonna be your gallery.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise, Samantha.
- What are you doing here, Margaret?
- I'm with her.
- How's it going?
- Your husband's doing very well.
He's only three down.
Honey, you should have seen me on that last hole.
I was sensational.
All that getting up early and practicing was really worth it.
- But he does talk a lot.
- He talks a lot.
Shall we play.
Make sure you miss this shot.
- What are you using, Stephens?
- My 7-iron.
You'll never reach there with a 7.
You better take a 6.
Just to show you what can be done if you put a little muscle into the shot l'll use my 8-iron.
- I'll get it for you.
- Thank you.
- It's your funeral.
What a beautiful funeral.
Knock it off, Margaret.
How about that shot, Joe?
I think I'll try an 8-iron, myself.
I thought I told you to miss this shot.
- I tried to, but I'm just too good.
- Well, stop chortling.
First person who says "tough luck" gets this club rammed right down their throat.
You're driving him wild.
You're about to blow a million-dollar account.
- But, but, but - Darrin, it's only money.
And what do we need with money?
Two poets like you and me?
You're only two up, right, champ?
I can count.
I'm afraid you're slicing right into trouble, right into the trees.
And out.
When you're sharp, everything goes your way.
Or do you suppose it's because you're shot in the pants with luck?
Stephens do you inhale or exhale on your backswing?
I don't know.
Joe, what kind of a dirty trick was that?
I'm terribly sorry, Darrin.
I didn't mean to throw you.
Margaret, don't say a word.
Try inhaling on your backswing.
It seems to work for me.
I'll exhale, if you don't mind.
I think you can blame that shot on Stephens.
Tate, I'll think of my own excuses.
- Joe, all I meant was - It's your turn.
Shoot.
Here's mine.
Do you realize I'm only one down?
Yeah.
And you're going to stay one down.
Darrin, are you sure you hit this far?
Look, Joe, it went right in the tin can.
Go ahead and play it.
Joe, would you call that a natural hazard?
- Oh, I would.
- So would I. - Larry, can I borrow your wedge?
- Just hit it.
I don't believe it.
I guess you'd call it lady luck.
I guess that makes us even, doesn't it?
Look, Joe, under these extraordinary circumstances I think the only fair thing to do is play the hole over.
Tate, the only thing I resent more than his luck is your patronizing attitude.
What I meant was What did you mean, Larry?
I'm terribly sorry, Darrin.
I couldn't stop it.
Where did your drive go?
Right down the fairway, over 300 yards.
I wish you'd cough when I drive.
I'll give that to you, Larry.
That makes a nine for me.
I've got a sure birdie here.
All you have to do is hole out from the sand trap and you've got a tie.
I knew it was too good to be true.
Well, don't choke up, Joe.
All you need is a little 10-inch putt for a tie.
Will you let me putt?
- Just straight in, Joe.
- Quiet!
Darrin, I am deeply shocked by your whole behaviour this afternoon.
Yes, that's right.
Your smart remarks, your frivolous attitude toward a man who is a fine sportsman.
Here's your putter, Joe.
- As Joe said, you can learn - Do you mind?
Not at all.
As Joe said, you can learn something when you play golf with a man.
And I've learned you're not the kind of man I want at McMann & Tate.
And I wouldn't hire a man who'd hire a man like Stephens.
What?
Actually McMann hired him.
Hold it, boys.
Joe, I have an interoffice memo for you.
You may be president of the firm but it's my daddy's money, and I own it.
But, Margaret.
Maggie.
Midge, honey.
The account is going to a new firm.
The Darrin Stephens Advertising Agency.
Well, thank you, Mrs. Baxter.
- And I assure you, that account - Wait a minute.
He can't do that.
He works for me.
- You just fired him.
- Yeah, you just fired me.
- It was just temporary.
- It was just temporary.
Well, Joe?
I always said you learn a lot about a man by the way he accepts defeat.
But I never thought I'd be learning a lot about myself.
There's one consolation.
The winner buys at the 19th hole.
- Stephens?
- My pleasure.
I don't suppose you'd be willing to teach me that tin can shot, would you?
Actually, in performing the tin can shot, it's necessary to face the club.
There's a wonderful picture at the Lyceum.
Let's go see it.
You know, Sam, those drives of mine today as good as any Jack Nicklaus ever hit.
And that 8-iron shot that I laid stiff to the pin Arnie Palmer would take that any day.
And that explosion shot out of the sand trap that broke Joe's heart Darrin, I was there, remember?
Wasn't it great?
Did you notice the backspin I put on that ball?
- When exploding from a sand trap - Darrin.
- Sam, I'm thinking of joining the tour.
- The what?
I'm turning pro.
There's a lot of money to be made.
We'd enjoy the travelling.
And if I'm as good as I think I am, we'd be set for life.
Darrin I win a few tournaments there'll be Darrin Stephens golf clubs Darrin Stephens shirts, slacks, shoes.
And a Darrin Stephens hat, size 10 and a half.
I hate to tell you this, sweetheart but you didn't make any of those great shots.
Oh, really?
You knew?
Sam, even in my best college days I couldn't sink a 30-yard approach shot out of a can of peanut brittle.
Then you're not mad?
Who could be mad?
It was a good thing you did letting the hot air out of Joe Baxter's stuffed shirt.
I'll get your coat.
We'll go to that picture.
No, no.
You just stay right where you are.
I'll get it.
Sam.
So sue me.
It was worth it.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
"Suddenly the steeple clock struck midnight.
As the children watched the bright bonfire three creatures seemed to jump out of the flickering flames.
The children shivered as if a cold wind had passed over them.
There was a gremlin, a goblin and a jack-o'-lantern".
See the jack-o'-lantern?
Jack-o'-lantern.
That's right.
And there's the goblin and the gremlin.
They cute?
Gremlin.
Now, you lie down, and I'll finish the story.
Now, you shut your eyes.
That's a good girl.
"'I knew we shouldn't have told all those Halloween stories,' Janie wailed.
'Now those creatures have come to haunt us.
' Suddenly, Billy, who was the bravest of all the children jumped up and threw sand on the fire and the creatures disappeared".
Sam.
"But later, when the children were safe in their cosy beds nobody was quite sure if he had seen the gremlin the goblin and the jack-o'-lantern or whether he had just imagined them".
Sound asleep.
All it took was a little bedtime story.
Do you think it's a good idea reading to her about goblins and creatures?
Oh, sweetheart, don't be silly.
She loved it.
Sam, maybe she loved it too much.
Now, darling, we agreed that Tabatha was gonna have a normal, mortal Halloween, just like any other child in the neighbourhood, didn't we?
- That's right.
Well, so I just read her an ordinary little mortal Halloween story.
There's no harm.
And tomorrow night, her ordinary daddy and her Ordinary mommy are gonna take her trick-or-treating.
- Cute, huh?
- Yeah.
- It'll be her first time.
- Mine too.
Oh, Mother would have a fit.
Speaking of your mother, where is she?
Oh, she flew to the south of France.
She's hiding out till Halloween blows over.
Well, that makes it official.
A normal, mortal Halloween.
Ring around the rosey Pock et full of posies Ashes All fall down Ring around the rosey Pock et full of posies Ashes All fall down I wonder what she's got in those sacks.
- Gladys, get away from the window.
- Why?
Because maybe somebody will throw a rock at you.
Who would want to throw a rock at me?
Me, if you don't get away from the window.
Your Uncle Abner thinks he's being funny.
Funny is better than crazy.
Wanna hold that?
Hold still, sweetness.
I'm not a sweetness, and I wanna go out and play.
- Abner, did you hear what I said?
- No.
You know, she shouldn't be allowed out today.
They say their powers increase on Halloween.
This is a stupid costume.
Oh, no, it isn't, sweetness.
It's adorable.
I wish I had the nerve to take you over to Mrs. Stephens and ask her if it looks real.
How would she know?
Is she a witch or something?
You see?
Tommy has my intuition.
- I hope not.
- Why?
Because one crazy person in the family is enough.
I don't wanna be a jack-o'-lantern.
I wanna be a monster.
For that, you don't need a costume.
I'm sorry about Larry spoiling our trick-or-treating.
I just couldn't help it.
Well, that's all right, dearest.
We all know business is business.
- Daddy coming?
- No.
Daddy has to stay home and wait for Aunt Louise and Uncle Larry.
Remember, just ordinary trick-or-treating.
No Darrin, I am shocked.
On Halloween?
This is amateur night.
Come on.
Have a good time.
Get lots of goodies.
Bye-bye.
Say bye-bye to Daddy.
- Bye, Daddy.
- Bye-bye.
My goodness!
- Well, who are you?
- My friends.
Well, your friends are pretty scary, sweetheart.
If I didn't know you were a goblin I would say you were little Billy Watkins.
No?
Well, whoever you are, would you like to go trick-or-treating with Tabatha?
Okay, let's go.
- I wanna go over there first.
- Oh, no, sweetness.
We're not going anywhere near them tonight.
I wanna go play with them.
Don't argue with Aunt Gladys, sweetness.
There.
One two, three and four.
- How's that?
- Oh, my, what do you say?
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome, I'm sure.
Come on, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come along, kids.
Thank you, Mrs. Robinson.
Good night.
And good hunting, children.
Tabatha, no!
No, you mustn't do that.
- They did it.
- Now, none of that, missy.
If you don't behave yourself, I'm gonna have to take you home.
Let's go, kids.
Here.
Now scat.
I thought I told you kids to beat it.
What the?
How did you do that?
Lady, that'll be just about enough.
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Here's your candy.
You can have the candy.
Just get them out of here.
Now, you children go on.
Tabatha has to go home.
She's not gonna trick-or-treat anymore tonight.
Go on.
Listen, young lady.
I've gotta get you home before you psych out the entire neighbourhood.
Tabatha, I am surprised at you.
After I warned you not to do any tricks.
Not me, Mommy.
My friends.
Well, that just makes it worse.
Blaming it on other people.
All right, young lady.
You're going straight to bed.
Tabatha who are those children?
My friends from the book.
Oh, my stars!
Goblins and gremlins When I look You'll be off the street And back in the book Tabatha, can you get them back?
Funny Mommy.
Funny Mommy, naughty Tabatha.
All right, I'll be back in just a minute with your friends.
Sam and Tabatha are out trick-or-treating.
They'll be back any minute.
Come on in, I'll fix you a drink.
Tommy.
Tommy, sweetness, wait for Aunt Gladys.
Hey, he looks just like me.
Don't give me away.
We'll play a trick on Aunt Gladys.
Oh, boy.
Will she be surprised!
You mustn't run away from Aunt Gladys like that.
We're trick-or-treating together.
Come on.
My heavens, more trick-or-treaters.
We've certainly been busy tonight.
Haven't you been here before?
Answer the lady, sweetness.
- Tommy's so shy.
- Well, come right on in, Tommy.
I've got a fresh chocolate cream pie that's just about ready.
Come on.
Don't give me away.
Okay.
Okay, spooks, come on.
Come on, the fun's over.
Come out of there.
Hurry up.
I'm not sure how to get you back where you belong yet but I can sure keep you out of the way until I figure it out.
I have never been so disgraced in all my life.
You are going straight home and you are going straight to bed.
I swear, I don't know what's happening with children today.
All right now, Tabatha.
You be a good little girl and put them back in the book.
If you put them back, I'll let you play with them tomorrow.
Play now.
Tabatha, you're just being stubborn and wilful.
- Is that you, honey?
- Daddy.
I'll be right down.
That's okay, sweetheart.
We'll come on up.
I want Larry and Louise to see how cute Tabatha looks in her costume.
All right, now, you spooks, you behave yourself.
- Oh, Tabatha - I'm no spook.
Where did you come from?
What I don't understand is how I got here.
If you're here, then the other one is - I wanna get out of here.
- That makes two of us.
I want my Aunt Gladys.
By the long arm of disaster you don't mean Aunt Gladys Kravitz that lives across the street?
I sure do.
Terrific.
- Hi, Samantha.
- Hi, Sam.
- Oh, happy Halloween.
- He'll celebrate anything.
Did you have fun, sweetheart?
Who do we have here?
Well, this is little Tommy from across the street and those two are from out of this neighbourhood.
- Aren't they cute.
- Adorable.
And Tabatha looks just like a tiger.
Sam made the costume herself.
And who made your costume?
- Aren't they cute?
- I wanna go home.
Well, yes, dear.
I'll call your Aunt Gladys in just a minute.
Now, sweetheart, say good night to Aunt Louise and Uncle Larry and kiss Daddy good night.
- Good night, Tabatha.
- Night, night.
And how much would you charge to haunt a house?
Sam.
Sam, what's going on?
What are those things?
Well, they're Sam!
It would take forever to explain.
But I'll straighten everything out.
You go and take care of Larry and Louise.
- Did Tabatha?
- Yes.
- Can't you?
- No.
No, it's wish craft.
She wished them into being, and she's the only one that can wish them back.
- Great.
- You scoot.
- Go on.
- Yes.
Oh, Tabatha.
How could a nice little witch like you get me into a great big mess like this?
All right, now, come on.
All of you.
Come on.
Hurry up, hurry up.
March.
Tommy, you take that mask off right now!
You just wait till I tell your mother about this.
You just wait.
Abner!
Abner!
Come quick!
Abner!
Abner!
Abner, something terrible's happened!
Tommy lost his head.
Why not, his Aunt Gladys has lost her mind.
How can you eat at a time like this?
I'm hungry.
Hello.
Mrs. Kravitz?
This is Mrs. Stephens.
I was wondering did you and Tommy get home all right from trick-or-treating?
What have you done to my Tommy?
I don't know what you mean, Mrs. Kravitz.
I certainly didn't have anything to do with it.
This time you've gone too far.
If my Tommy isn't back to normal immediately, I'll call the authorities.
Tommy Tommy!
Abner!
Abner, he's gone.
Tommy's gone.
She's got him!
Good.
I hope she keeps him.
I don't know whether you understand this or not but you take one step out of this kitchen, and you'll wish you hadn't.
Well, everything's under control.
Mrs. Kravitz is coming over to pick up Tommy and I guess I'll just have to get the other children home.
- Here you are, Larry.
- Thanks.
Dinner ought to be ready pretty soon.
I'm not a spook.
I'm just a little kid.
I wanna go home.
I'm just a little kid.
Where is he?
Where is he?
What have you done with him?
Calm down, Mrs. Kravitz.
Tommy!
Tommy!
Tommy, where are you?
It's all right.
It's your Auntie Gladys.
- Where have you put him?
- You know our neighbour, Mrs. Kravitz.
Sometimes on Halloween she gets fits.
I don't know if the rest of you are peculiar too.
But this woman has stolen my nephew.
And if I don't find him, she's gonna turn him into a frog or something.
"Fits" is putting it mildly.
Would you care for a drink?
No, thank you.
I just want Tommy.
Oh, now, Mrs. Kravitz, there's nothing to worry about.
Tommy's in the kitchen.
He was wearing the same costume as one of the other children.
He got mixed up and came here by mistake.
That's all there is to it.
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
In the kitchen.
Tommy!
Where are you?
Aunt Gladys, help.
Tommy!
Tommy, Tommy, darling.
What have they done to you?
They turned you into a goat.
That's my nephew.
- Marvellous.
- Get away from him.
Please, Mrs Larry.
Larry!
Come back here!
I tell you, she turned my nephew into a goat.
Right in the kitchen.
And he won't come out.
Oh, what'll I tell my sister?
You say there's a goat in there?
There.
That's a goat all right.
Tommy!
Tommy, come home.
I want Abner to see this.
He's a cute little kid.
Tell them.
Tell them.
This time, I have a witness.
Now Abner will believe me.
She's right.
There's a goat in the kitchen.
Don't worry, Tommy.
You won't remember a thing.
Come on.
Hi, Aunt Gladys.
Tabatha, now, please listen.
I know what a wonderful feeling it is to be part of the magical life.
But you have to understand that we're living in a world that isn't quite ready for us yet.
I'm afraid they may never be.
I'm going to have to be very firm with you and insist that you wish your friends back into this book.
It's very important to Daddy.
- Daddy?
- Yes.
Gremlin home.
Goblin home.
They're home.
- That's a good girl.
- Yes.
Tommy, sweetness.
Tell them you were a goat, with horns and whiskers.
- Tell them there was a goat.
- I didn't see any goat.
- But you said - I was just trying to be polite.
Well, I sent the other children home.
I guess I'd better get started with dinner.
I wanna go home.
Yes, Tommy.
Let's go home.
And I'll have some of my medicine.
Hey, there's that little jack-o'-lantern kid again.
And I think you've had enough of your medicine.
There's nothing like a nice, normal, quiet, mortal Halloween.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Well, at least Louise is happy.
Larry's on the wagon.
Look at this.
There's a grizzly bear loose in this house.
Wait a minute.
Not quite.
Oh, no.
No.
Let her keep it.
At least it's a step in the right direction.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
That was great.
Name one other man who has crêpe suzettes for lunch.
Oscar of the Waldorf?
And you didn't use any to make these, did you?
Certainly not.
I just used the regular ingredients.
Plus a little love.
Have I told you recently how happy I am you asked me to marry you?
No, but the next time I make these, I'll leave out the brandy.
No, no.
This is your day of rest.
I will not have you even step into the kitchen.
- Lf you insist.
- I do.
Sam.
Guess who's getting out of a cab?
- Who?
- My mother.
Oh, no.
I can't let her see the kitchen like this.
She'll fire me.
Darrin, this is for both of us.
You've done what?
You heard me.
I've had my last quarrel with your father.
I've left him.
But why?
What happened?
What happened?
I'll tell you what happened.
You won't believe what happened.
What?
If you don't mind, I'd rather not talk about it.
Hello, Samantha.
- Mrs. Stephens.
- But you'd think after 35 years a man would show more respect for a woman.
- What did he do?
- I'd rather not talk about it.
Mom, can't you give us some idea of what this is all about?
No.
I only know I cannot live in the same house with a man who says l'm imagining things in my old age.
- What kind of things?
- I don't want to talk about it.
My dear how lucky you are to be married to someone like my son.
You'll never have to worry about finding lipstick on his collar.
And if you do, he won't give you some idiotic story about a waiter dropping lingonberry pie on him.
Especially when lingonberries are out of season.
Mom, you don't seriously think that Dad Darrin, you don't seem to understand.
I do not wish to talk about it.
No, if you don't mind, I'd like to lie down.
- I'll show you to the guest room.
- No.
No, I don't want to be a burden.
I might as well get used to doing for myself.
And, Darrin, if your father calls, I do not wish to speak to him under any circumstances.
Is that clear?
Okay, Mom.
I'm sure she'll get over it in a day or two.
What do we do in the meantime?
Suppose one of your relatives drops in.
I'll have to tell them not to.
Good.
Get on the phone or whatever you use and send out the warning.
Well, I'll contact Mother first.
Then Aunt Hagatha and Aunt Enchantra.
And dear Uncle Arthur.
And most important of all Who?
Aunt Clara.
Did you call?
- Too late.
- Too late.
Clara.
What was that noise?
Mother, you know Samantha's Aunt Clara.
Oh, yes.
What happened to you?
Me?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
No, I just got caught in the downdraft as I was landing.
No damage done.
No damage done.
And the chimney needed sweeping anyway.
Oh, my, did that chimney need sweeping.
Grandma.
Look what Grandmother has for you, darling.
Oh, I love presents.
Aunt Clara, come here.
Come here.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Oh, what a lucky little girl you are.
When I was here before, I brought her one of my doorknobs.
Sam, can't you get rid of her?
Oh, honey, I can't do that.
You know how sensitive she is.
I'll talk to her.
I'll tell her to be extra specially careful.
That's like asking a waterfall not to spill.
Can't we do something to keep her quiet?
Let me help you, darling.
I've got it.
How about watching some movies of the baby?
Good.
That should keep her quiet for hours.
Oh, look at that.
Oh, isn't that wonderful.
Well, it really is - What is it?
- It's a toy nurse's kit.
Of course, yes.
A kit for toy nurses.
Aunt Clara, Darrin's tried something different this time.
He recorded the baby's voice at the same time he made the movies.
You mean, we can hear the baby's voice while watching the picture?
- Right, if I roll them both together.
- Oh, my.
Talking pictures.
Oh, that's an amazing idea.
Oh, dear.
You'll make a fortune here.
Then you put the other end against the patient's heart and then you listen.
And if you listen carefully you'll hear a broken heart.
It's all set, I hope.
Get the lights, honey.
- We sing a song?
- Yes.
What shall we sing?
"Old MacDonald"?
- Yes.
- Okay.
You have to sing too.
Okay.
Now, remember, Samantha, if that's Frank, I don't wanna talk to him.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Mr. Stephens.
Well, no, I don't think that's such a good idea at the moment.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Please don't tell me what he said because I am not interested.
- All right.
- What did he say?
He wanted to speak to you.
You heard what I said.
Yes.
But after 35 years, you'd think he'd insist on talking to me.
Okay, honey, here we go again.
Get the lights.
- Hi.
- Hi, can we sing a song?
- Yes.
- What shall we sing?
- "Old MacDonald"?
- Okay.
Oh, darn.
It was a good idea anyway, sweetheart.
I'll get it, honey.
I'll get it.
I think I'll go in the den and lie down until you get this thing working.
Okay, Mom.
I think, if you'll let me I know a little incantation that might make this work.
Juncture, puncture, fiddle-de-dee Camel, hamal, soup for three Habble, dabble, red and green Stop the v oice Until the picture's seen Well, go ahead and try.
What shall we sing?
"Old MacDonald"?
- Okay.
- You have to sing too.
Okay.
What?
How about that.
You can come in now, Mother.
It's working.
That's marvelous, Aunt Clara.
Not yet, Mother, not yet.
Holy mackerel!
Now you're out of sync.
I know.
I'm okay now.
Oh, thank heaven for that.
I was afraid it was something I did.
Well, whatever it is, it's gone.
We're ready now, Mother.
Have you got anything stronger than an aspirin?
Well, I'm sure I can find something - What What was that?
- What was what?
Her voice.
Her lips moved, and then I heard her voice.
Mother, how long has it been since you've had your eyes examined?
You mean l?
I just thought l?
This whole thing is having a terrible effect on me.
- Sam, what are we gonna do?
- First of all, let's not panic.
Easy to say, but how long do you think we can fool my mother?
Maybe you should get your The way this thing comes and goes is driving me cuckoo.
I'll try to get my mother out of the house.
A spell has been said To one who is wed A spell has been said I wish I was dead.
All I'm saying, Dad, is I'd appreciate it if you could get Mother to come home.
I realize that makes it tough.
I'll see if I can't get her to come to the phone.
You hold on.
Mother.
- Yes, dear.
- Phone for you.
Who is it?
Search me.
Hello?
Didn't I tell you I didn't want to talk to him if he called?
Yes, but I called him.
Darrin Stephens, you do that again, and I'll box your ears.
I used to do it so well back in the days that are gone.
Nothing went wrong, and I didn't need it.
Well, Aunt Clara, you've done all you can.
We have to get in touch with Dr. Bombay.
It is unnerving, isn't it?
Yes, I Well, I'll go and fetch him.
Aunt Clara, do you think that's such a good idea?
You mean you don't trust me?
Well Now, have I ever failed you in an emergency?
Well, that's very kind of you.
I'll go fetch him.
I didn't have any luck What's that?
Yes, I need these.
I just remembered that there's a cinder path in front of Dr. Bombay's house.
Dr. Bombay?
You're sending for that quack?
He is a qualified doctor.
Maybe to you, but to a qualified doctor is he a qualified doctor?
Darrin, he's our only choice.
Okay.
What do we do till the quack arrives?
Now, how about this.
Tell your mother I'm coming down with a cold and that I have to go to bed.
- Good idea.
- Well, I'll fake a few sneezes.
That will keep me out of her way until Dr. Bombay arrives.
I feel like I'm in an Italian movie.
Mommy sick?
No, I'm just resting.
Mommy talks funny.
Why can't I go up?
I might be able to do something for her.
- I have to listen.
- Not necessary.
The doctor should be here any minute.
She's my daughter-in-law, and I insist on going up.
Mother, what good can you do?
You seem to forget I've had a good deal of nursing experience.
Pushing a bookmobile at the hospital is not nursing experience.
For your information, I absorbed a great deal of medicine while delivering those books.
I'm going up there.
Mother, I think you ought to let her rest.
Mom.
Mother, I don't think you ought to go in there.
Mother, I've got an idea.
Why don't I take you to a nice afternoon movie?
How are you feeling, Samantha?
Better, thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
What's that for?
I didn't wanna contaminate anybody.
What's keeping that doctor?
He lives some distance away.
Say that again.
Mother, I really think we should leave her alone.
Darrin, will you stop nagging me?
You're as bad as your father.
Come on.
Up.
Come into the bathroom.
What you need is an aspirin and salt gargle.
- But - And you can leave.
I'll mix it for you.
Mommy sick?
No.
Daddy is.
All right, take it off.
You don't need the salt.
The aspirin does the trick.
Here, go ahead.
There.
There, I heard it.
That time I heard it.
She gargled first, and then I heard it.
How can that be?
Her voice is behind her.
It comes out later.
I never saw anything like that in all my life.
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking her pulse.
- That's not where you take a pulse.
- That's not where you take a pulse.
Dear, dear me.
She's burning up.
You've got a very sick witch here.
She's my mother, and she's not a witch.
Well, she's not too warm for a mortal.
Doctor, that isn't the patient.
I'm the one with the problem, Dr. Bombay.
Oh, yes.
Indeed you are.
Oh, I had the most incredible dream about Oh, there he is.
All right, all right, everybody out while I examine my patient.
Come along.
Out.
Out.
No exceptions.
Outside.
Everybody out.
Out, out, out!
Now, then.
What are you doing there?
In, in, in.
Sit down.
Leg up.
Watch out.
Take your slipper off.
Really, Clara, these spells of yours that misfire are getting quite tiresome.
Every time it happens, I have to drop what I'm doing and mix up another batch of Bombay's Super Cure-All.
Kindly pass me that wolfsbane bottle, please.
I've quite enough trouble keeping up with my own practice.
I'm sorry, doctor.
Truly sorry.
And if I could remember my own incantation I wouldn't have had to bother you.
- What incantation?
It's a remover of spells.
Bad spells.
Oh, I have it on the tip of my tongue.
I know the first two lines.
Clara.
A spell has been spok en And now must be brok en And What's the rest?
And There you are.
Cross your fingers.
- Will that help?
- Well, it won't hurt.
Bottoms up.
- Oh, it's delicious.
- That's the vanilla.
Vanilla.
What else?
Sam, you're back in sync!
Oh, thank you, Dr. Bombay.
Well, now that I'm back to normal, I think we ought to do something about getting your parents together.
- Right.
- I'll go downstairs and talk to her.
I call on the spirits With bated breath And order you to Remove it Oh, no.
Oh, no.
And this, darling, is the eraser.
Eraser!
Oh, of course.
I call on the spirits With bated breath And order you to erase it That's wrong.
But it's getting closer.
Samantha, dear, are you feeling better?
Much, much better.
Your face.
What's the matter with my face?
Oh, my stars!
I want to thank you for being so gracious, doctor.
It just proves how foolish it is to prejudge another person.
Well, from now on, in my book you are One of the worst quacks I have ever met.
Mrs. Stephens, wouldn't you like to lie down?
No, that's the trouble.
I've been lying down too much.
I think I'd better take a walk.
Oh, there's Frank.
Thank heaven he's come.
That's all we need.
My father.
Don't just stand there, do something, quick.
Don't get hysterical, my good man.
- Oh, Frank.
- Well, Phyllis.
You look as though you've seen a ghost.
Worse.
Samantha's face is covered with green stripes.
What?
These side effects will be gone before you can say "Charlie Fuqua".
There, you see, they've gone.
Oh, well, thank heavens.
Swell, now she's out of sync again.
Evidently.
Well, you have a choice.
Green stripes or out of sync.
- What do you want?
- What?
Oh, really.
My good man, make up your mind.
I've lots of other patients.
But But Erase.
Remove.
Rub out.
My dear boy, I must go.
I'll check with you later.
Eradicate.
Aunt Clara.
A spell has been spok en And must be brok en And I call on the spirit With breath bated And order him to eradicate it Well, I certainly hope that works because Oh, it does.
If you don't believe me, take a look at Samantha and What happened to your stripes?
Stripes?
What stripes, Mrs. Stephens?
No, there's no question about it.
You're going straight to the doctor.
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
She needs you.
Oh, Frank, you were right.
I have been imagining things.
Worse things than you can imagine.
Can I come home?
Well, if you don't, I'm prepared to carry you off forcibly.
Oh, my dear.
How much longer is Darrin gonna be on that phone?
Well, it's a business call.
He's been in there for over an hour.
Oh, I know, but some of these calls go on forever.
Perhaps you'd rather not wait.
- Oh, I want to say goodbye to him.
- Well, I'd like to say hello.
Darrin?
Could you stop for a minute, say goodbye to your mother and father?
Goodbye, Mother.
Goodbye, Dad.
Well.
Goodbye, dear.
And thanks for everything.
It really has been a wonderful day.
- Well - Goodbye, dear.
- Oh, yes, it was our pleasure.
- Do let me know how the baby is.
- I certainly will.
- Goodbye.
Sorry you have to rush off.
Well, they're gone.
Now, sweetheart, I know you're upset, and I don't blame you but please try and have a little understanding, won't you?
Darrin, you don't know how you've hurt Aunt Clara.
Well, she loves us, and she's crazy about Tabatha.
Darrin, I'm surprised at you.
It's not like you to hold a grudge.
So please please forgive her.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thanks, honey.
You know what I'm gonna do this weekend?
- What?
- Nothing.
Not a single, solitary blessed thing.
I'm not even gonna answer the phone.
If that doorbell rings, it can just ring.
Hello there.
What if somebody lands in our tree?
Oh, dear, I'm afraid I zigged, and I should've zagged.
Come here, Aunt Clara.
Let me help you.
- Oh, dear.
- My.
- Oh, thank you, dear.
Thank - I'll get it.
I thought you weren't gonna answer the door.
We answered the tree.
Why not the doorbell?
- Oh, I hope I'm not intruding.
- No.
Never.
We're always happy to see you, Aunt Clara.
Oh, bless you, dear.
Darrin, am I lucky I caught you at home.
Hi, Larry.
Come on in.
Honey, it's Larry.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
- You remember Aunt Clara.
- Of course.
How are you, Aunt Clara?
Hi.
Oh, have I got great news.
Great news, Darrin!
Sit down.
Sit down.
- You mind if I stand?
- No, why?
Because whenever you say "sit down" like that I always end up back on my feet, yelling.
Not this time you won't, you lucky son of a gun.
How would you and Sam like an all-expense-paid weekend in Chicago?
- Chicago?
- Chicago?
Oh, I think that sounds wonderfully exciting.
You know, the Springer Pet Food account is coming up for renewal.
What I had in mind is for you and Sam to soften him up a little.
Smooth the road for us when he comes to town next week.
So I arranged this little luncheon with Springer and his wife.
What do you say to that?
You mean you don't want to go?
Actually, Sam and I have plans for the weekend.
Oh, now, don't you worry about me.
You two go and have a good time and I'll stay here and take care of Tabatha.
- Thanks, Aunt Clara.
- Thanks, Aunt Clara.
Thanks, Aunt Clara.
Then it's all settled.
The plane reservations, hotel reservations.
Plane leaves at 4, lunch tomorrow at 1 at your hotel.
Well, I guess I have to be running along.
I was going to suggest that.
Oh, I almost forgot.
You know, if we land that renewal there's a big bonus in it for you.
You son of a gun.
Oh, isn't that a nice man?
- Aunt Clara, we're leaving.
- I'll be right there.
Tickets, money, car keys.
I'm all set except for one thing.
- What's that?
- My peace of mind.
Darrin, will you please stop carrying on?
Aunt Clara's perfectly capable of taking care of Tabatha.
But who's gonna take care of Aunt Clara?
Everything's under control.
Our little darling is fast asleep.
Good.
Now, you have that list I gave you?
Yes.
It's here, it's here.
Everything's on it.
Nothing to worry about.
Now, you run along and enjoy yourselves.
- Well, thank you, dear.
Goodbye.
- Bye-bye, darling.
You be sure to read her a story at bedtime, Aunt Clara.
- Goodbye.
- Lf she cries during the night - Goodbye, Aunt Clara.
- Goodbye.
To me, Stephens, the most important ingredient in any product is the pride of the man who makes it.
- And the man who sells it.
- Exactly.
Of all the pet foods we manufacture, my favourite is our birdseed.
Now, I believe in birdseed.
Mrs. Springer will tell you that.
Right, dear?
Oh, yes.
Tell them about the sales convention.
We had this one wise-guy salesman.
And He claimed he wasn't selling any birdseed because it wasn't fit for animals.
So Alvin stood up, and he ate a whole box of birdseed and made a fool of him.
- Tell them about it, dear.
- Well, that's it.
I ate the whole box.
How many other birdseed manufacturers would do that?
Not too many, I imagine.
- Maybe none.
- Pardon?
I mean, that's certainly a convincing demonstration of faith.
Well, thank you, young lady.
May I tell you both something?
Now, we've only just met but in my opinion, you two are real pet-food people.
- We are?
- Thank you.
Cute monkey.
Well, now, l Where did that come from?
Funny monkey.
There isn't a thing on that list about what to feed the monkey.
- Hello?
- Hi, Aunt Clara.
Just calling to see if everything's all right.
I'm glad you called.
I didn't know what to feed the monkey.
Feed the what?
I say, I don't know what to feed Tabatha's monkey.
You're not talking about her stuffed monkey, are you?
No, this isn't a stuffed monkey.
Oh, no.
If anything, I think he's hungry.
Don't do a thing, Aunt Clara, I'll be right there.
That was your mommy, and she's going to pop in.
Well, that's just as I thought.
Oh, Aunt Clara.
Tabatha turned her toy monkey into a real one.
Oh, that's what you meant.
Isn't she wonderful?
She's coming along, you know.
Tabatha, you turn him back immediately.
Oh, she really is talented.
She is rather amazing, isn't she?
But, Aunt Clara, that is something we do not want to encourage.
Well, why not, for heaven's sake?
- Aunt Clara, remember, I'm not here.
- You're not?
Of course.
Hello, Aunt Clara.
I'm Louise Tate, remember?
Yes.
Yes.
- Samantha isn't here.
- Oh, of course.
I know that.
She's in Chicago.
You mean, she didn't tell you where she went?
I know where she went, but I don't know where she's going.
- Pardon?
- Is there any message in case I see her?
- No.
I'll call her tomorrow night.
- I got rid of her.
- Well, you almost got rid of me.
Now, let's go over that list.
Number one What did you mean, if you see her?
How?
- Samantha?
- Hi, Louise.
I thought you were in Chicago.
Yes.
Well, I was going but at the last minute, we had to change our plans.
Our sitter got sick.
Well, I thought your aunt was sitting for you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You better take care of that.
Take care of what?
What a shame, Samantha.
I mean, Larry was counting on your being there.
In fact, he suggested that I stop by to make sure that everything was all right.
- Oh, how sweet of Larry.
Yes, he is thoughtful.
Well, I'm sorry you have to be rushing off, Louise.
I'd ask you to stay for a cup of coffee.
Well, thanks anyway.
Some other time.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Wait a second.
Who said I was in a rush?
- That's very good.
- Isn't it amusing?
- No.
Don't get up.
- We were getting worried about you.
- We certainly were.
- I'm sorry, but I had a little trouble getting through to our sitter.
- But you did.
Oh, yes, everything's fine.
- Good.
- For the most part.
Well, I'm delighted you found your little love nest in such good order.
Meanwhile, we have a little surprise of our own.
Haven't we, Stephens?
Yes, honey.
While you were on the phone Mr. Springer agreed to renew the account.
Oh, that is a happy surprise.
And I'm just about to put a call through to Larry Tate right now and give him the good news.
Excuse me.
Larry Tate?
Alvin just can't wait to tell him how fond we are of both of you.
Oh, that's nice.
- What's the matter, honey?
- Nothing.
Nothing at all, Darrin.
Hello?
Speaking.
It's Springer.
Darrin's really fouled things up this time.
Well, hello there, Mr. Springer.
Now, I know why you're calling.
I just found out myself that Stephens couldn't bring his wife along.
His wife couldn't make it, eh?
But I can assure you that she was brokenhearted.
You may as well know the worst, Tate.
Stephens had the colossal gall to bring along some blond he picked up.
- And he introduced her as his wife.
- What?
Mr. Springer, I can't believe that.
That's not the sort of man I want to represent Springer Pet Food to the public.
And it shouldn't be the kind of man you want to employ.
Right, Mr. Springer, on both counts.
But I hope it's not going to affect our relationship.
- Not at all.
- Oh, thank you.
Because as of this moment, our relationship has ended.
Mr. Springer.
Wait.
Just let Hello?
- Did you reach Mr. Tate?
- I did.
- I bet he flipped when you told him.
- Oh, he flipped all right.
Mrs. Stephens, you haven't told us anything about your home life.
I'm sure Mrs. Springer would be interested.
Well, what would you like to know?
We have one child, a girl.
A very nice house.
That keeps me busy most of the time.
Does it?
Young lady, you're one of the coolest numbers I've ever run into.
- I beg your pardon?
- It's a little late for that now.
My dear, at the risk of offending your delicate ears with the height of gross indecency this lady is not Mrs. Stephens.
What do you mean?
What's he talking about?
- Now, Darrin.
- And don't deny it.
Tate just told me.
The nerve.
Come along, my dear.
I'm sure you want to go home and lie down.
Oh, yes, dear.
I feel one of my migraines coming on.
Goodbye, Mr. Stephens.
Goodbye, Miss Whoever-You-Are.
What does he mean?
What's he talking about?
Well, sweetheart, I think I know.
Remember when it was your idea that I call the house?
Well, while I was checking, Louise dropped by.
Louise?
Dropped by?
- Out there in the phone booth?
- No.
In there.
In our front hall.
You mean you?
And Louise told Larry, and Larry told Springer - Sam, why didn't you use the phone?
- Well The phone.
The phone.
The phone.
Well, hello.
Well, aren't you home a little early?
We're home a lot early.
- There was a slight change in plans.
- So slight it's too horrible to mention.
Hello, sweetheart.
Aunt Clara, Darrin may lose his job.
Oh, I think that's splendid.
Then you'll be able to spend more time at home.
Oh, I'm happy for you.
And if I have helped in any way Aunt Clara, I think maybe you'd better take Tabatha upstairs.
Yes.
Come along, dear.
Oh, I just knew this was going to be a lucky weekend for both of you.
Sweetheart, she meant well.
Yeah.
You know, this may be the best thing that's ever happened to me.
It's time I made a change.
Darrin, when you talked to Larry on the phone he didn't come right out and fire you, did he?
No.
He's waiting till I call him back, then he's going to fire me.
Now, Darrin, I know Larry.
Now, I bet he's sitting at home right this minute just feeling terrible about the whole thing.
You really think so?
Of course, he does need me.
As a matter of fact, I'm indispensable.
In the advertising business, men of my calibre are very hard to find.
He can't afford to fire me.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
How are you?
What'd I tell you?
How's everything, Lar?
Fine, Darrin, just fine.
Now that I've got the Springer account back.
You got the account back.
That's terrific, Lar.
How'd you do it?
It was easy.
I just promised Springer you'd never set foot in our office again.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute, Larry.
So first thing tomorrow, come in and clear out your desk before Springer arrives from Chicago.
Now he wants me to come in and clear out my desk tomorrow.
- Oh, dear.
- And I'm glad.
- Glad?
- At least we don't have to come up with a logical explanation of what happened in Chicago.
That's true.
Sweetheart, could I go with you tomorrow?
What for?
Well, I have to take Tabatha shopping, and so Do you mind?
Okay.
Anyway, it's nice having your loved ones with you when you're walking the last mile.
- Martini?
- Two.
Yes, sir.
I'll tell him, Mr. Tate.
Mr. Springer, Mr. Tate says he'll be down momentarily.
About time.
Well, Mr. Stephens, how are you?
- How are you, Mrs. Stephens?
- Fine, Charlie.
And look who's here.
My, but you're getting to be a big girl.
You know, Mrs. Stephens the way she's growing up is enough to scare you.
And what a doll.
Yeah, she's the spitting image of you.
- Thank you, Charlie.
- Well, I gotta get back to work.
- Mr. Stephens, Mrs. Stephens.
- Goodbye.
Stephens, hold it a minute, will you?
- Mr. Springer.
- Then I did hear right.
- This is your wife.
- Believe it or not.
Well, I don't understand.
How dare you confront Mr. Springer.
I'm sorry, sir.
I told him It's all right.
I'm just trying to clear up a little confusion.
Oh, boy.
You mean it's all out in the open, huh?
I'm sorry, Sam.
I tried to keep it from you.
Keep what?
Tate, I think you're the one who's confused.
This is the Mrs. Stephens who was in Chicago.
The real Mrs. Stephens.
But Louise said I don't understand.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on here?
Mr. Springer, we enjoy socializing with my husband's clients not because we feel we're obligated to, but because we want to.
Now, my husband feels very strongly about that.
Don't you, dear?
Yes, of course.
So when we created that little misunderstanding about who he was with, he thought that your attitude was out of line and you didn't deserve an explanation.
Is that a fair statement, sweetheart?
Yes, I would say that was very fair.
I think.
We purposely made you think that Samantha wasn't my wife just to see how you'd react.
Right, Lar?
He's crazy.
They're both crazy.
My wife Shut up, Tate.
I'd like to hear more.
Oh, yes, so would I. Go on, Stephens.
By all means.
McMann & Tate is one of the busiest advertising firms in the country.
They're in demand.
And we just They just don't have time fooling around with people who are more interested in prying into their employees' lives than in the job they do for them.
Are you saying you don't want my account?
He didn't say that.
You didn't say that, did you, Darrin?
No, I'm saying we want your account, but we don't need it.
That represent your point of view too?
Oh, no, I should say not.
Too bad, because I think it's a kind of a unique attitude.
- Takes guts.
- That's it, guts.
Guts and imagination.
You might say that's the hallmark of our entire backbone.
So to speak.
All I'm really saying is if we deliver the goods and I believe we have, what else matters?
I like his style.
Put him back on the payroll.
Why, he was never really off.
I was just trying to throw a little scare into him.
Thanks, old buddy.
His kind doesn't scare easily.
And I wouldn't wanna have him on the opposing side.
Well, it's nice to have you two back in the Springer Pet Food family.
- And you too, sweetheart.
- Hi.
Well, I guess that cancels our luncheon appointment, Tate.
I've got to take Mrs. Springer shopping.
Now, why don't we all meet tonight at my hotel, and we'll finalize the deal.
- Great.
- Bye-bye.
- See you tonight, Mr. Springer.
- All right, Tate.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Darrin, forgive me.
I must be going out of my mind.
No, I take it back.
It's Louise who's going out of her mind.
Oh, now, Larry.
Don't you go blaming it on Louise.
Why not?
There's no question about it, she's crazy.
How could she be crazy?
She married you, didn't she?
That's true.
Well, we're going to take Tabatha shopping.
Wait a minute, Darrin.
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
I was testing you.
Morning, Aunt Clara.
Sleep well?
Not particularly.
I've been so worried about that poor Mrs. Tate.
Is she any better?
Well, I'm expecting her over any minute.
And I think I can straighten her out.
With a little help.
Excuse me.
I hate to impose, Serena, but you do owe me a favour or three.
Well, well.
What happened to all your mortal values?
I thought it wasn't nice to lie.
Well, this is just a white lie.
And for a good purpose.
Oh, I see.
In your mortal world, all you need is a good reason to lie.
Yes.
No, I mean.
There she is.
Now, Serena, please cooperate.
Oh, very well.
But this settles our account.
I have to make a few changes.
Aunt Clara, if that's Louise, I want to talk to her alone, okay?
- Hi, Louise, come on in.
- Can't stay long.
Have to be at the psychiatrist at 9.
Well, you have time for a cup of coffee.
Good morning, Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara, I think I heard the baby cry.
- You did?
I didn't hear the baby cry.
- Aunt Clara.
Oh, I think I hear the baby crying.
Louise, I thought if you dropped by here first you might not have to go to the psychiatrist.
Oh, I certainly do.
Larry insists.
And frankly, after what happened, I don't blame him.
Samantha, I just can't apologize enough for all the trouble I've caused you.
Louise, I'd like you to meet somebody.
Come on in.
- She - It's my cousin, Serena.
Do you mean when I dropped by here the other day that she?
That's right.
Well, why didn't you tell me who you were?
You didn't ask me.
Louise, I'm afraid Serena was playing games.
When we were children, we used to love to fool people.
Well, Serena would like to apologize.
Wouldn't you?
If you say so.
What a relief.
I'm going right home and tell Larry.
Well, I'm glad it's all cleared up.
I'll walk you to your car.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Good morning.
Who was that?
- Louise.
- Were you able to straighten her out?
Yes.
I think she'll be okay now.
- Where's my good-morning kiss?
- Right here.
- Hey!
- And don't ever try that again, Serena.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- Darrin, what are you doing?
- I'm reading some reports.
Then why do you keep going like this: Because I know upstairs my daughter is playing with your mother.
- So?
- So I'm nervous.
It's too quiet.
I think they're finger-painting.
With whose fingers?
What does that mean?
Picasso's?
Rembrandt's?
You don't think Endora would paint with her fingers.
She absolutely possibly might.
Maybe they're not there.
Maybe that's why they're so quiet.
Maybe they flew over to the Venice Film Festival.
- Aren't you late for your golf game?
- I don't have a golf game.
How about tennis?
Tabatha would like to show you her finger-painting.
There, you see?
- It's an original van Gogh.
- What did I tell you?
Get rid of it.
- You could sell it for lots of money.
- That's just the point.
Get rid of it.
Oh, Durwood, really.
You're such a Such a mortal.
- Mother.
- Oh, very well.
That's peculiar.
Samantha, you try.
Mother, are you all right?
- Can I answer that question?
- Darrin.
I feel perfectly fine.
I'm going to change.
I'm late for a cocktail party in Monaco.
Tabatha, bye-bye.
Grandmama will see you next week.
Fly carefully.
That is peculiar.
Oh, Samantha.
Samantha, I seem to be grounded.
You probably have a sticky valve.
That happens with older engines.
Darrin, this could be serious.
Perhaps it's the atmosphere.
Samantha, you try popping out.
No.
No, it's you.
Mother, you have a pooped popper.
I've completely lost me powers.
Oh, Mother!
Well, I can't believe it!
Neither can I. How do you feel?
How would you feel if you suddenly mysteriously lost your powers?
- Well - I'd feel wonderful.
You don't have any powers.
He means, he'd feel wonderful if I didn't either.
Correct.
Mother, don't you have any idea what could have caused this?
No.
You haven't been around any black Peruvian roses?
I haven't even been around a Peruvian.
You haven't been mixing eye of newt with oysters?
Did you fly backwards with one eye shut past a warlock with six warts on his nose?
Darrin, that's not funny.
- Mother.
- What?
It must be something serious.
- Please, let me call a doctor.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'd be too embarrassed.
Just let me lie here quietly.
I'll see how I am tomorrow.
Excuse me.
I want to talk to Darrin alone for a minute.
Darrin, would it be all right if Mother stays here overnight?
- No.
- Oh, please.
I'm worried about her.
Why can't she go home?
You can't get there from here.
I mean, without, you know Why can't she go to a hotel?
Oh, Darrin.
She's afraid to be alone.
Well, I can tell.
Please?
- Okay.
But one night only.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
Mother, Darrin insists that you spend the night.
I'll bet.
All right, you bet while I get you another cold towel.
Abner, come over and look at Mrs. Stephens' mother.
Abner!
Abner!
Abner!
Yes, my love?
Tabatha Stephens just made a newspaper fly through the air like it had wings.
Do you know what that proves?
News travels fast.
I hoped a good night's rest would cure you.
- So did I. - Now should we call the doctor?
I'll think about it.
Did she get her powers back?
- No, she did not.
- Oh, that's a darn shame.
- How's my little sweetheart?
- Fine.
Excuse me.
- What's that?
- Cereal.
- For breakfast?
- Don't you like it?
No.
I always have fried raven's eggs, over easy.
Then you go right ahead and whip them up.
Darrin, don't be cruel.
Samantha, won't you twitch up some raven's eggs for your mother?
Sorry, Sam knows the rules.
I forbid witchcraft in this house.
Tyrant.
- Mother.
- What?
While I butter the toast, why don't you pour the coffee.
Oh, certainly.
Shucks, I guess you'll just have to pour it by hand.
Oh, it's heavy.
Thanks for trying.
- Mother.
- Yes, darling.
I hate to be a nag, but you really should see a doctor.
Darrin, don't you think Mother should see a doctor?
- I've always thought that.
- Well, fine.
I wouldn't want to do this without your approval.
Samantha, you plucked me right off me dolphin.
And I was winning the race.
You tricked me.
I thought you meant a legitimate doctor.
I beg your pardon?
- Hello, Dr. Bombay.
- Hello, Endora.
I trust you have a superb reason for interrupting me.
Yes, Dr. Bombay.
Mother seems to have lost her powers.
- Endora?
- I'm afraid so.
Why, it seems to me only a few weeks ago that you were suffering a loss of your powers, Samantha.
This family is getting into a rut.
- When did it happen?
- Yesterday.
- And where does it hurt?
- No place.
Just in the pride.
I'd better give you a complete checkup.
My wife's family doctor.
He's just our general practitioner.
You should see our specialists.
- What's he doing?
- He's listening to her foot.
I'm sorry I asked.
The family may come in now.
I've examined the patient from head to foot and I've made my diagnosis.
- What is it?
Endora, you are suffering from an allergy.
- To what?
- To birds.
- Birds?
- To birds?
The medical facts are obvious.
She has lost her powers of witchcraft due to changes in her occult metabolism caused by contact with a particular kind of a bird.
What kind of bird?
That's the puzzling part.
Endora has been in contact with the rare Macedonian Dodo bird.
But a Macedonian Dodo bird has been extinct for millions of years.
That's not the point.
The point is you have run into a rare Macedonian Dodo bird and the encounter has rendered you powerless.
- Dr. Bombay?
- Yes.
If Mother had come in contact with the Macedonian Dodo wouldn't she have noticed it?
- Not necessarily.
It could have sneaked up on her from behind.
- Can you cure her?
- Instantly.
As soon as you produce the bird.
What for?
We must pluck a feather from the guilty bird's tail to use as an ingredient in the potion.
Dr. Bombay, how can we possibly find the feather when we don't even know where to find the bird?
Well, I can't answer that, can I?
I'm a doctor, not a miracle worker.
- Since when?
- Darrin, please.
- And what happens in the meantime?
- That's an interesting subject.
In many cases of allergy, the victim's powers go off into limbo and they float there.
Unless Unless what?
Unless by magnetic polarization those forces attach themselves to some other witch or warlock whose own powers are dwindling.
Dr. Bombay, do you mean to say that a perfect stranger could acquire my powers?
Not a stranger.
No, it would have to be a relative.
Well, I must be off.
Let me know if something comes up.
A relative whose powers are dwindling.
Well, the only one I can think of is Aunt Clara.
Hi there.
Oh, I just had to fly over to show you.
Show us what?
Oh, the many things I haven't been able to do in all these years.
Like this.
Duck's down and lettuce Present form, forget us Aunt Clara, change Mother back.
Oh, yes, of course, dear.
I was merely demonstrating my new power.
Roses are red Violets are blue I am me And you now are you Clara, you will live to regret this moment.
Careful, Mother, let's not make her angry.
No, watch it.
And watch this.
Weebus, warbus, tootles, flick Eat all this And you'll be sick Oh, excellent, Arturo, excellent.
Excellent, my foot.
Get that stuff out of here.
But we're having a celebration.
This is a party.
Let's start with the pâté de foie gras.
Durwood, help me.
What did you say?
I said, Durwood, help me.
You'd think if you wanted me to help you, you'd use my correct name.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What was it again?
Darrin.
Oh, yes.
Well l'll try.
Straighten my pillow.
Turn it around the other way.
That's right, there.
Yeah, that's better.
Dennis where's Tabatha?
- She's upstairs playing.
- Well, I want her to play here.
She's been playing in her room all morning.
I thought Samantha was going to make me some cocoa.
I'll see what's keeping her.
- Sam, your mother is driving me crazy.
- She is?
She acts as if she's totally helpless.
By her standards, she is.
Darling, do me a favour.
Take this out to her.
I have to make a call.
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara?
Oh, my.
- I just had lunch in Holland.
- So I see.
- I'm having dinner in Mexico.
- Yeah, well, so I see.
It's very attractive.
But, Aunt Clara, I want to talk to you about Mother.
Oh, well, just a minute.
I'm a quick-change artist.
Well, I'm glad to see you're enjoying yourself, Aunt Clara.
- But about Mother - Now, I'm sorry about Endora but I'm a swinger and I like to swing.
- Yes, I understand, but - I didn't steal her powers.
Until you told me, I had no idea where they came from.
Well, now, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.
- You sure?
- With her temper?
I wouldn't dare.
Okay, Aunt Clara.
You're clean.
- Oh, may I go now?
- Yes.
Oh, it's such a nice day.
I think I'll go sailing.
Abner!
Abner!
Wake up, wake up!
What do you want?
Our street has turned into a harbour!
Come, Abner!
That was a good one, Gladys.
And tell the psychiatrist about it when you see him.
- What psychiatrist?
- The one I'm going to send you to.
- There you go.
- Thanks, honey.
Oh, cute.
Is Tabatha still in her room?
What's the big attraction there?
Privacy.
You meant that as an insult, didn't you?
- No, Mother, he didn't mean - He hates me.
- He doesn't hate you.
Do you, Darrin?
- He does too.
I'll have to live out my life in a climate of hatred.
What do you mean, live out your life?
Have you forgotten?
I'm not leaving this house without my powers.
I never agreed to that.
I only agreed to last night.
Come sundown, I call you a cab.
Right?
- Right?
- Well - Well, what?
- Who'd take care of her?
We could put her in a home for senior citizens.
When you're as senior a citizen as she must be they'll give her the best room in the house.
Darrin, you can't do that.
- She's my mother.
- And I'm your husband.
She could divorce you.
She could turn you into a parakeet, and we could keep you in a cage!
Sweetheart, I thought you didn't want me to practice witchcraft.
I'll make an exception.
Because he hates me.
If she doesn't leave, I will.
For how long?
I'll let you know.
Would you like a handkerchief?
No, thank you.
- Just go upstairs and pack his bags.
- I'm not planning to divorce him.
Oh, very well.
It was just a passing thought.
The fault resides in man's inhumanity to man.
Take, for instance, the field of international water polo.
Hey, bartender what happened to the drunk?
Samantha, I demand a good explanation.
I think we've discovered a way of getting Mother's powers back so she can leave.
- That's good enough.
I needed you here so we could reenact the events of yesterday morning prior to Mother losing her powers.
Macedonian Dodos can't have anything to do with it.
Come on, let's all go to the nursery.
What's that?
That's a Macedonian Dodo.
Bobby, I told you to stay in my room.
Tabatha, who is Bobby?
He's Bobby the bird.
- Where did you get him?
- I made him up.
Out of one of your picture books?
Oh, if I weren't so relieved, I'd be furious.
- When did you do it?
- Yesterday.
That's why she's been spending so much time in her room.
That's where I came in contact with it.
She must have hidden it in the closet.
Did you?
Oh, Tabatha.
I guess we owe Dr. Bombay an apology.
Samantha, this time you plucked me off me porpoise.
Dr. Bombay, you were right.
A Macedonian Dodo bird.
Yes, a baby Macedonian Dodo bird.
- Baby?
- Yes, indeed.
One of the species directly related to the giant Auk.
Now the solution is simple.
Stirring gently, so as not to bruise.
Drink this.
I'm cured.
Splendid.
I'll pop back to me porpoise.
Help!
Aunt Clara?
- Where are you?
- I'm on the roof.
Excuse me.
Oh, I was flying back from the yacht races and my engine conked out.
Oh, Aunt Clara, I'm afraid your moment of infinite glory is over.
Gladys, you sure pick strange places to get romantic.
- You miss Bobby the bird?
- Yes.
Well, maybe if you're very, very good, I'll let him come to your birthday party.
You will not.
How come that bird had no effect on you?
I don't know.
I guess I'm just immune to Macedonian Dodos.
Darrin would you be happy if something were to happen and I lost my powers?
That's a very difficult question.
With a very simple answer.
I love you, and I don't want you to change one bit.
You just stay as wonderful as you are.
You looking forward to a quiet weekend?
I certainly am.
Hello, Samantha, darling.
Tweety-weety, Tabatha.
Hello, Endora.
How are you?
- I'm not speaking to you.
- That's a step in the right direction.
Your treatment of me in my recent period of indisposition is unforgivable.
And might I add typical.
Endora, please forgive my lack of understanding.
I'll do anything you ask to make up for my poor behaviour.
- Why are you so gracious?
- Oh, I don't know.
- I do.
- Why?
He saw what it was like to have you as a normal, mortal mother-in-law and he decided he'd rather have you as a witch.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Gorgeous.
Aunt Clara, why didn't you tell me you were coming?
Well, I didn't know.
Now, I was home in bed, asleep and unfortunately I talk in my sleep.
Well, Aunt Clara, I'll take care of that.
Oh, thank you, dear.
You're so talented.
Sweetheart, guess who just dropped in.
Do I have to?
Aunt Clara.
Just in time for Thanksgiving dinner.
Isn't that wonderful?
I don't think he hears you.
- Darrin, can you hear me?
- No.
I told you so.
Excuse me, Aunt Clara.
- Don't do that.
- Don't you be rude to Aunt Clara.
I was looking forward to a peaceful dinner with just the three of us.
It'll be a peaceful dinner with just the four of us.
Wanna bet?
No, but she's here now, and we'll just have to make the best of it.
Come on downstairs.
Oh, no, thank you, dear.
Tabatha, now Aunt Clara will tell you all about the first Thanksgiving.
It was a blast.
We ate for three days.
- You were there?
- Why, yes, of course.
Oh, what memories.
The Pilgrims.
Plymouth Rock.
Miles Standish Priscilla John Alden Boston Blackie.
No.
No, that's not quite right.
I think I'll go and check the turkey.
I think I'll make another drink.
Samantha.
Darrin.
Would you mind if I didn't stay to dinner?
Why, not at all.
I mean, we want you to do what you want to do.
Well, I'd love to stay but reminiscing about Plymouth has made me homesick for the girls I knew that settled there.
I'd like to visit them.
- We understand, Aunt Clara.
- I'll make a plane reservation for you.
No, no.
No, that won't be necessary.
I know what you're thinking.
But I'm perfectly capable of getting there on my own power.
Turk ey poult down Send me back to Plymouth town You sure you don't want to take the plane?
- No, thank you.
- You'd love it.
- How about a train?
- No, thank you.
Wings of falcon Turk ey poult down Tak e us back to Plymouth town - Sam, where are we?
- Plymouth, of course.
What are you doing here?
Aunt Clara, we got caught in your jet stream.
Hey, what is this?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
But don't you worry.
Now, I brought you here, and if you don't want to stay l'll zap you home.
- No, thanks.
You will not zap us home.
We will zoom home the old-fashioned way.
By jet airliner.
Sam, this is Plymouth.
- Seventeenth-century Plymouth.
- Yes.
Isn't it exciting?
Well We've gotta get out of here.
They burned witches in the 17th century.
The ones they thought were witches.
Not the real ones.
The big witch hysteria didn't start until much later.
Well, I don't like even a little witch hysteria.
Sam, can't you think of some way to zap us away from here?
Aunt Clara zapped us here, and she has to zap us back.
What about our clothes?
How will we ever explain our clothes?
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
That, I can handle.
Now, sweetheart, don't worry.
- Greetings to thee, stranger.
- Greetings to thee.
We have come from out of the wilderness.
We have marched nearly 20 mile this day.
I warrant thou shalt have reason for the giving of thanks.
Nay, we are poorly.
A crust of bread is all that standeth between us and starvation.
Take thee and thy family to the table of John Alden, 20 yards distance and join us with the Indians on this day of feasting.
Are thou?
I mean, art thou John Alden?
I am.
Imagine.
I didn't know you spoke Pilgrim.
We have been invited to dinner by John Alden.
- Good morrow.
- Greetings.
Hi there.
Everything okay?
'Tis a poor jest.
My husband meant thee no harm.
What's with him?
Well, "Hi there.
Everything okay"?
Is not exactly a popular 17th-century greeting.
Just follow my cue, and thou shalt be as one with the others.
Aye, so be it.
I'll feel a lot better when thine Aunt Clara getteth us the heck out of here.
Thou art groovy.
Greetings.
Why dost thou allow thy womenfolk to eat and idle?
There are few enough to tend to the cooking.
Get thee to thy pots.
Don't speak to my wife in that tone of voice.
I mean, speaketh not to my wife thusly.
We'll get something to eat with the womenfolk.
Come on.
- Be careful.
- You too.
I'm so worried about you in the 17th century, I couldn't eat a thing.
Thou art very sweet.
Maybe I could force myself.
All I had for breakfast was puffed rice.
Puffed rice?
'Tis a jest.
He hath a penchant for poor jests.
This very morn, well Thou never couldst carve a roast without adding a mite of thine own blood.
'Tis the fault of this poor jester and his strange womenfolk.
Aunt Clara, are you concentrating on getting us out of here?
Oh, yes.
Now, don't you worry.
- I'm getting closer.
- Oh, good.
Double, double, toil and trouble Aunt Clara, this is no time for Shakespeare.
You're supposed to zap us back home.
Well, "double, double, toil and trouble" seemed to fit the situation.
It fits.
It just doesn't work.
I don't like this dream.
It's too much work.
Maybe it isn't a dream.
But if it isn't a dream, what is it?
And then he sayeth to me, "That wast no lady, that wast my wife".
Captain Standish, I do believe I saw Phineas laugh.
The festivities doth raise my spirits, I'll not deny it.
Canst thou remember the last time thy mood was so festive?
Aye, it was across the sea at the burning of a witch.
- We hanged all our witches.
Oh, it were merrier to burn them.
You I mean, thou findest pleasure at the burning of a witch?
Indeed.
Wouldst thou not?
Well, certainly not.
Some of my I mean, some of my closest That is, I findeth other sports more to my "fanthy".
Fancy.
He speaks in a manner that rings strangely to the ear.
Aye, and his womenfolk are stranger.
The whole world seems strange to thee, Phineas.
Honey, we have to get out of here.
I don't like that anti-witch talk Phineas is spreading.
- It's dangerous for you.
- Now don't worry, sweetheart.
Aunt Clara is making some progress.
What do I do with this laundry bag?
It's not a laundry bag, it's a pudding bag.
We have to dip it in some boiling water.
Oh, we better get a fire started under that pot.
I'll do it, honey.
- Anything else you'd like me to do?
- Witch!
Witch!
There is a witch among us.
There is witchcraft here.
There is a witch among us.
- Who, her?
- No.
Him.
Sam, where's Tabatha?
Oh, she's playing with the other children.
- She thinks this is great fun.
- Oh, it is.
I wouldn't miss it for the world.
They can't really burn me as a witch, can they?
- Not while I'm around.
- You don't sound too convincing.
I don't?
Well, I'm certainly trying.
Ye are accused of being a witch.
'Tis a grave charge.
What say ye to it?
It's ridic 'Tis ridiculous.
I art not now, nor hath I ever been a witch.
Admit to witchcraft or it will go ill with you.
You'll be burned for refusing to confess.
And if I do confess?
Then you'll be burned for being a witch.
I don't supposeth thine has heard of thy Bill of Rights?
Can ye not speak more plainly?
What I meaneth to say "ith" I mean, is hath I no rights at all?
Indeed, in this village ye do.
Speak for yourself, John.
Let us hear evidence before lighting any fires.
Aye, John, that will be done.
Tell us, Phineas, why thou hast made so grave a charge?
I can explain I mean, I canst explaineth if thou wilt but remove me from these chains.
Do not free him.
It is a witch's trickery.
Were the accused truly a witch, could mere iron contain his trickery?
The good woman speaketh sensibly.
- I wouldst release him from his chains.
- Very well.
Oh, poor, dear Darrin.
Now, how can a young man like him get into such trouble as this?
Oh, I must help him.
Aunt Clara, just concentrate on trying to remember how to get us out of here.
Yes, yes, I understand.
I understand.
And I really will concentrate.
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's nothing at all.
Didst thou light the fire as Master Phineas hath saideth?
I hath lighted the fire, but not as he hath saideth.
Didst thou strike a spark to flint?
Or make heat by rubbing wood against wood?
Nay, I did none of these.
I used a match.
- A what?
- A match.
'Tis a sliver of wood with chemicals on it.
I have one here.
There is naught to fear.
See, 'tis out now.
This object that the accused hath called - Match.
a match may be a device of witchery.
To test it, we must find out if any one of us can light it.
- Then shall we - It wilt not work.
It has already been lighted.
It will not light again.
Silence!
I only wisheth to explaineth about matches.
Silence.
Continue.
He doth not like my idea which leadeth me to believe it may be sound.
Only a witch can make a fire from a plain stick of wood.
I wouldst defend the accused.
Sam, you can't defend me.
It's too dangerous.
They believe only a witch would defend someone accused of being a witch.
That makes me the logical choice, doesn't it?
You may defend the accused.
I thank thee.
First But after Phineas has presented all his evidence.
The first time the accused witched me, I almost dropped a turkey.
It didst not satisfy such as he.
When I carved the fowl, he wrought his witchery again causing me to cut my finger.
And if that is not sufficient for ye I wouldst report his conjuring this very morn.
How did ye greet me this morn?
"Good morrow"?
"Good day"?
"Greetings to thee"?
No.
No.
None of these.
This witch didst raise his hand thusly and spake the conjure words: "Hi there.
Everything okay"?
How dost thou know that this be witchery?
Aye, I find the same question at my lips.
If this be not witchery, what else couldst it be?
It were not a greeting known to mortal man.
Host thou not noticed a strangeness in his speech, captain?
Aye, that I have.
What be this strangeness of speech and manner?
Why doth he speak and act and look different than all of us if it weren't for the witchery within the man?
Woman, hast thou anything to say in his defence?
Aye.
First, I wouldst congratulate Master Phineas.
He hath shown us a way out of difficulties that all can follow.
Art thou clumsy?
'Tis not thine own fault.
Cry witch.
Art thou forgetful?
Blame not thyself.
Cry witch.
Whatever thy failings, take not the fault upon thyself.
'Tis more a comfort to place it on another.
And how do we decide who is the witch?
'Tis simple.
Again, Master Phineas hath shown us the way.
Doth someone speak differently from thee?
A sign of witchery.
Doth he show different mannerisms?
Witchery, of course.
And should we not find differences in speech and manner to support a charge of witchery, be of good cheer.
There are other differences.
What of he who looketh different?
What of she whose name hath a different sound?
If one examineth one's neighbours closely he will find differences enough so that no one is safe from the charge of witchery.
But is that what we seek in this New World?
Methinks not.
The hope of this world lieth in our acceptance of all differences and a recognition of our common humanity.
Hear, hear, hear.
But what of the witch's stick?
No fine words canst prove that he who maketh fire with a stick of wood be not the witch.
The honour of such a test doth go to the man who hath brought the charges to clearly prove that he himself is not a witch.
Are you afraid to strike the witch's stick?
Since Phineas hath made the witch's stick to light he must confess himself a witch else he must withdraw all the charges made against the accused.
Samantha.
Samantha.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
It just came back to me.
It came back to me in a flash.
It wasn't a flash, really.
It was a flame.
- Yes.
- The match reminded me of Master Phineas hath withdrawn his charge against the accused.
Wing of fire, eye of flame We hold the accused innocent and free him of his binds.
Tak e us back To whence we came Where's Tabatha?
Oh, hi, sweetie.
My goodness, you've had quite a day, haven't you?
Oh, I hope I didn't leave anything out of that incantation.
Like what?
Like Darrin.
Darrin?
Darrin?
Darrin!
Darrin!
- Darrin!
- Sam!
Abner.
Abner!
Wait till you see this.
Abner.
When you see this you'll know that all the other times you thought I was just dreaming you'll know I was just dreaming.
Oh, poor Mrs. Kravitz.
Darling, it's delicious.
Oh, you sure it isn't overcooked?
No, it's perfect.
The truth is, you usually undercook turkey.
This is just the way I like it.
You've hated all the other turkeys I've ever cooked for you?
No, they were all delicious.
This one, naturally, is super delicious.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
Well, it's better than those tough wild turkeys we had in Plymouth.
Aunt Clara, will you please pass the cranberry sauce and talk about something else?
- Here.
Well, yes, there is something I want to talk about.
Now, Christmas will be here soon.
Now, I have an idea where to spend it that would be very enjoyable and very educational for Tabatha too.
Now, look here.
Now, how many children have the opportunity to meet Santa Claus?
And after all, the North Pole isn't so very far away.
We could all go there the day before Christmas.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Mother, this is the worst thing you have ever done.
And considering the past, that's saying a lot.
I couldn't help it.
He came home and had the effrontery to tell me I didn't know how to look after Tabatha.
Turn him back.
I made a few rather witty remarks about his stupidity and then he accused me of riding him.
Turn him back.
So I showed him what it was like to be really ridden.
Him and his childish tantrums.
Now, sweetheart, come here.
Now, listen.
Don't do anything that'll make Mother mad.
She might do something even worse.
Now, sweetheart, the thing to remember is that I love you.
Oh, how revolting.
Oh, now, Darrin Darrin, don't say anything, please.
- I mean, just - I have no intention of speaking to your mother.
I have only one thing to say to you.
You can say anything you want to me.
Yell at me, scream at me Either your mother gets out of this house and stays out, or I do.
- Oh, now, Darrin - Until she goes, I don't come back.
Well, we're rid of him.
You heard what he said.
Out.
At the moment, I can think of a number of places I'd rather be.
Good.
But I have a sweet and forgiving nature.
I might even do something nice for Darwin, such as a peace offering.
Oh, that would be a very good idea.
Now, what should it be?
Something nice.
Something very, very nice.
If there's one thing I do pride myself on, it's my imagination.
And may I say that we will handle your account with all the thoroughness and attention that we have in the past.
With all the thoroughness and With all the thoroughness we have in the past.
It has been our exp - Mr. Stephens.
- Yes?
That perfume company in Paris, the one you did the ads for they sent you a sample of their new perfume, Hallucination.
Tell me what you think of lt.
I tried that new perfume.
What do you think?
I think Hallucination is a very good name for it.
Mr. Stephens, are you all right?
Oh, that perfume's got quite a kick.
Makes you feel like jumping up and down.
I think I'd better get it out of the building.
Mr. Gregson, I'd like you to met one of our bright young men Darrin Stephens.
I don't have to tell you who Mr. Gregson is.
- No, indeed.
How do you do?
- How do you do, young man?
What happened to your desk?
They're not making wood the way they used to.
Something must have gone against the grain.
Won't you sit down.
- Pull up a chair, Larry.
- Thank you.
I was discussing with Mr. Tate how we'd handle your account if you decide to come with us.
I've definitely severed relations with my present agency.
They don't understand my image.
If I may say so, Mr. Gregson, your image is the American home.
And if I may say so, Gregson Home Appliances should be synonymous with that perfect American home.
I never had one as a child.
I was an orphan.
So you see, the perfect home is sort of a dream of mine an ideal, a - Your wife?
- Oh, no.
- Mother?
- No.
My mother-in-law.
That's fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
In all my life, I don't believe I've ever seen a man with a picture of his mother-in-law on his desk.
Lately I've been taking it with me everyplace go.
She must be a treasure.
You must adore her.
Well, let's put it this way.
She's the sort of woman who's hard to resist.
I'd like to meet her.
My wife and I are having dinner with the Stephens tonight.
- You are?
- Perhaps you could join us.
Oh, no, no, no.
As much as I'd like to meet his mother-in-law I wouldn't think of intruding.
I'm running late.
It's been nice meeting you, Stephens.
- Mr. Gregson.
- I'll be talking to you later today.
- Give us a ring anytime.
- I'll do that.
- Bye, Mr. Gregson.
- Bye, Larry.
How could you look so dumb when I said we were coming to dinner?
- Well, I didn't know you were.
- We weren't.
But when Mr. $10-Million- Worth-of-Advertising says he'd like to meet your mother-in-law, we are.
When I talk to him later, I'm gonna tell him that Samantha absolutely insists on his coming and your mother-in-law is dying to meet him.
She isn't.
She may have other plans.
What's the matter, Larry?
Just thinking how bare this office would look without your desk.
How forlorn this hat rack would look without your hat.
Darrin, please reconsider.
Don't leave the company.
We need you.
We love you.
- At least while you're with us.
- Larry, I refuse to be intimidated.
By a simple little dinner party with your best friend and his wife and a business associate?
Well, as long as you're putting it that way We'd love to have you, Louise and Mr. Gregson for dinner but that won't guarantee that my mother-in-law will be there.
Darrin, I know you'll do the very best you can.
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
In spite of what you heard, you are not invited to dinner tonight.
Thank you.
I'd love to come.
- They should be here any minute.
- Sweetheart, stop worrying.
I am sure, under the circumstances, Mother will not show up.
- Mother.
- You called?
I thought I heard my name.
Thanks for popping in, Endora.
Now do me a favour, pop out.
But I thought I was doing you a favour by being here to meet Mr. Gregson.
Samantha, will you kindly ask your mother what makes her think our marriage certificate is her deed to my house?
Now, wait a minute, sweetheart.
Both of you.
Perhaps under the circumstances it might be a good idea if Mother stayed.
- Lf you promise to behave yourself.
- But of course.
And if you apologize to Darrin for what happened this morning.
I regret my slight transgression of this morning however deserved.
- That's an apology?
- For Mother, it is.
Okay, but no funny business.
Witch's honour.
There they are.
I'll get it.
Mother, try and keep the conversation on a domestic level.
- Louise.
- Hi, Darrin.
- Darrin.
- Hello, Sam.
- Endora, how nice to see you again.
- Mr. Tate.
Honey, this is Mr. Gregson.
Mr. Gregson, I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to meet you.
Up until now, all I've met is your name.
Oh, it's on our vacuum cleaner and our dishwasher almost everything we own.
That's very flattering.
I've been looking forward to meeting you and your mother.
Endora, I'd like you to meet Mr. Gregson.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Gregson?
And may I say you look even more lovely in person than in your photograph.
Oh, not only may you say so but you can repeat it as often as you wish.
- More coffee, Mr. Gregson?
- No, thank you, my dear.
I was just telling Darrin how much I admire his frank display of affection.
Your picture on his desk.
I would never have been so egotistical as to have given it to him.
He must have stolen it.
Do you have your mother-in-law's picture on your desk, Mr. Tate?
Oh, I can answer that.
No.
I happen to be the kind of man that likes a clean desk, perfectly clean.
Clear head, clean desk.
Darrin can be so gallant.
He was so complimentary to Mother tonight about her dinner dress.
Endora has exquisite taste.
I'm sure your husband is just as complimentary to your mother, Mrs. Tate.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, indeed.
Darrin and I are exactly alike in that.
I wouldn't be surprised if he picked it up from me.
He sees my mother-in-law at our house so often.
We're a very close family.
You can drop in at our house anytime, and there she is.
She practically lives with us.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
- And I wouldn't have it any other way because when it comes to mothers-in-law I can safely say that mine is really something else.
Oh, excuse me, dear.
I was just crossing my legs.
Excuse us.
The light's better in the living room.
I wanna make sure I haven't broken the skin.
It's a wonder you didn't break my leg.
Will you stop with those thinly veiled insults about my mother?
I've got a client in there, and you're carrying on about your mother.
I don't care.
I will not listen to you insult my mother, even subtly.
Louise!
No, I'm not leaving.
I wouldn't give you the satisfaction.
Excuse me.
Nothing to be alarmed about.
Just an attack of nerves.
Louise had a little tiff with her hairdresser this afternoon, and Tate, there's no point in beating around the bush.
I don't think you understand my image.
I certainly do, Mr. Gregson.
The perfect American home.
You can't have a perfect home without a harmonious family.
Perfection, Mr. Gregson, is something that grows, like a flower garden.
Yours seems to be full of weeds.
Not every son-in-law is as cuddly as Darr-Darr and I are.
Right, and that's what's given me an idea.
Darrin, suppose I were to set you up in an advertising agency of your own.
- What?
- Turn my account over to you.
I appreciate it, Mr. Gregson, but it's out of the question.
Larry here is the genius.
I couldn't handle it.
I'm just a routine workhorse.
Oh, I wouldn't say routine.
He's a fine workhorse.
On the other hand, Mr. Gregson my son-in-law does understand your image.
Right.
He not only understands my image, he lives it.
Darrin, think it over.
I already have thought it over.
Larry is the brains.
- He's the greatest advertising man - Right.
He is so modest.
Yes, and I admire that in a man too.
Darrin Oh, my.
- What's the matter, Mr. Gregson?
- Oh, migraine.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Well, unpleasant scenes like this always bring it on.
Trouble is, my medicine's at home.
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm afraid I'll have to leave.
- Good night, dear lady.
- Until we meet again.
Yes.
Yes.
Mr. Gregson.
- Mr. Gregson - Good night, gentlemen.
Well, my boy, congratulations.
- What are you talking about?
- Very clever.
In no time at all you took a $10 million account from McMann & Tate and opened your own agency.
Don't be silly.
He was the one who suggested it.
- You played up to his weakness.
- Larry, may I remind you that you're the one who insisted on bringing him here?
That's where you showed real cunning.
Without me even suspecting it you made me think the whole thing was my idea.
Everything's just fine now.
- It is?
- Yes.
Louise is feeling much better.
We're leaving.
Oh, and Louise in this house, walk with your back to the wall if you don't want a knife in it.
- Larry.
I'll explain what happened later.
Come on.
Come on.
What happened?
- Well - Oh, yes, one more thing.
Be sure and let us know where to forward your mail.
What's so funny?
That's what I love about mortals.
They can get themselves into such hilarious messes without my even lifting a finger to cast a spell.
- Endora.
- Just call me Mother.
- Sweetheart.
- Good morning, darling.
Good morning and good news.
Mother dropped in to say goodbye.
She's on her way to Paris.
She wanted to select some designs that her couturier hasn't thought of yet.
That's marvellous, sweetheart.
That - There she goes.
- And there goes a whole night's work.
I've been lining up a campaign for Mr. Gregson.
He'll love it.
It's in tune with everything he stands for: Lmage, image, image.
- What time is it, darling?
- Nearly 9.
I have to get to the office.
I wanna go over this with Larry.
Thank goodness.
I thought maybe you'd taken last night a little too seriously.
Of course not.
Larry was just mad, and I don't blame him.
Gregson did give him a bad time.
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- What?
I'm gonna give him credit for this campaign.
- He didn't have anything to do with it.
- That's how we are with one another.
The doorbell.
Probably Larry come to apologize.
Mr. Stephens, Mr. Tate said to deliver your office furniture here.
Put it in the garage.
So that's how it is.
While I'm slaving in there to save his account he's throwing my furniture out.
- But maybe if you talked to I have no intention of ever speaking to him again.
I'm gonna take those advertising ideas down to see Mr. Gregson.
I'm gonna open my own office.
Well, now, don't do anything you'll regret.
I've always been the brains of that outfit.
It's time I proved it.
Sweetheart, you Fiddle-de-dee And fiddle-de-dum Let witchcraft work And let it hum Give all the credit to Larry Tate As Darrin wanted before his hate Magnificent.
Unbelievable.
Absolutely brilliant.
You know, without a doubt this is the greatest advertising presentation I have ever seen.
I brought it to you, sir, because I knew you'd see its value.
It has It has my image.
Last night you said that Larry Tate was the brains of your company.
- Well - One is expected to say such things at a time like that.
I regard humility as a virtue.
Well, the man who can do work like this is the man for me.
And the man who did that is at your disposal.
Good.
Let's go see him.
I was prepared to set you up in business but you quite simply and honestly gave me evidence that I should stick with McMann & Tate.
- Me?
- You have the image, all right but Tate has the brains and the know-how.
And when you get right down to the nitty-gritty never mind the image, I'll take the brains every time.
Do you know any other person who could do work like that?
Excuse me, sir.
"Larry Tate".
"Larry Tate".
"Larry Tate".
No, I know of only one person who can do work like that.
Darrin could've taken advantage of me.
He could've let me believe that he was the brains of this company.
But no, he simply showed me the magnificent ideas you'd come up with.
Well, I have so many brilliant ideas that sometimes I forget some of them.
You have a fine young man following in your footsteps.
His noble footsteps.
Well, we can discuss these ideas later.
- Drop in my office this afternoon.
- I will.
- Mr. Gregson.
- Darrin.
- Goodbye, Larry.
- Bye-bye.
You put my name to your work after I fired you and then threw your furniture out?
Remember that the next time you wanna fire me.
There won't be a next time.
Darrin, I wanna do something wonderful for you.
You name it.
- It isn't necessary.
- No, no, no.
Name it.
I'll let you name it.
How does this sound: McMann, Tate and Stephens.
It sounds sensational.
Well, one of these days, a few years from now if you follow in my footsteps, that's the way it's going to read.
Couldn't happen to a better man.
That's what I admire about you, Larry.
That's why you're the brains of this outfit.
You dream big.
Oh, no.
Oh, Mother, you've done it again.
Come on, sweetheart.
Get off Daddy's back.
Darrin, darling.
Sweetheart did something happen while I was out?
Well, did you get into another argument?
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
- Sam.
- Yes?
Oh, Darrin.
- That pony is shedding.
- I thought it was you.
Yesterday it was.
Oh, and Tabatha loved it so much that you bought her one.
No, I didn't.
All right, Tabatha, where did it come from?
Excuse me.
Come on, Tabatha.
That's a girl.
- The pony is on me.
- That I'd like to see.
- Darrin.
- Honey we cannot accept a gift that is conjured up by witchcraft.
Oh, really, Derrick.
Why, sometimes, you know, you're positively quaint.
- Endora, I refuse to even discuss it.
- Oh, the ingratitude of mere mortals never ceases to amaze me.
- No witchcraft - I'm getting tired of all this - You're constantly coming in here and, boom, explosions, animals running around all the time.
Oh, please!
Please!
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I'm sorry I missed your call last night, Louise but Darrin took me to the antique show at the Barkley Hotel.
Who took who?
Oh, yes.
Oh, it was fascinating.
You know that bentwood rocker I've been looking for?
Well, I found a really beautiful one.
But just my luck, it was sold.
Darrin?
Oh, yeah, he enjoyed the show too.
Especially when he found out I couldn't buy the rocker.
- Yes.
- Good morning, Durwood.
Sam, she's doing it again.
Louise, Mother just popped in so I'm afraid I'll have to hang up.
Goodbye.
Mother, why are you always doing that to Darrin?
Oh, I don't know.
It's like eating peanuts.
You can't stop.
Endora, I don't know what I'd do without you, but I'd rather.
Darrin, please Oh, I don't mind.
He always has a chip on his shoulder.
It comes from his head.
Stop it.
Stop it, both of you.
Why can't you two try and get along?
Hello.
Yes, he is.
Just a minute.
- It's for you.
- Who is it?
It's a lady.
She didn't give her name.
Naturally.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Mr. Stephens this is Alice Swanton at the antique show.
You were interested in that bentwood rocker for your wife?
Oh, yes.
Let me jot that down.
- I'll take it in the den.
- Want a pencil?
Here's one.
No, I wanted a pen.
I mean, I have to refer to some papers.
There goes a guilty man if I ever saw one.
Okay, honey.
I got it.
Oh, don't hang up.
I wanna hear this.
Samantha.
Mother, marriage is a poor excuse for snooping.
Well, if you ask me, this is a poor excuse for a marriage.
You mean that rocker's available?
I thought it was sold.
It was, but the woman who bought it changed her mind.
What a break for me.
I'm so glad, because I know your wife fell in love with it.
It'll be a wonderful surprise.
You and your ridiculous mortal code.
Mother, you are not going to pick up that phone.
Very well, but you can't stop me from listening.
I hope it wasn't awkward, my calling you at home.
Not at all.
My wife's not the suspicious type.
Well, when can you come over?
- I'll drop by on my way to work.
- Will you have time?
For something lik e this, I'll mak e time.
Mother, that's enough.
I'd say that's more than enough.
Samantha, you're such a child in matters like this.
I suppose you won't believe it until he brings her home.
Don't be absurd.
Now, watch him come in here and lie.
Darrin has never lied to me.
He's never had any reason to lie, because Are my ears burning because I have a fever or because Guess Who's talking about me?
That's a splendid idea.
What?
What's the idea?
I'm going to test your confidence in this marvellous mortal of yours.
Lumpkin Pumpkin Spider's eye If this mortal he doth lie Whether told to friend or told to foe Each lie will cause his ears to grow - Mother.
- Well, what's the difference?
If he doesn't lie, nothing will happen.
You take that spell off him.
Oh, don't be such a spoilsport.
Are my ears burning because I have a fever or because Guess Who's been talking about me?
I was wondering who that was on the phone.
The phone?
Oh, as a matter of fact, it was a substitute secretary at the office telling me about an appointment that had been changed.
Well, I gotta get going.
See you all.
Substitute secretary.
Substitute for what?
Good morning, Mr. Stephens.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Isn't it a lovely day?
Yes, it is.
Mr. Stephens, did you just get a haircut?
No.
Why?
Because you You look so nice.
Thank you, Mrs. Kravitz.
So do you.
Mrs. Kravitz, I wonder if you would mind if I had something delivered to your house.
It's a surprise for my wife.
What is it, her birthday or an anniversary?
- Neither.
- Just like that?
Isn't that nice.
Believe me, a lot of men could take lessons from you particularly the one I'm married to.
Now, that's what I call a husband.
Thank you.
Not you.
Mr. Stephens.
They don't even have an occasion, and he's buying her a surprise for no reason at all.
Now, why don't you do something like that?
You see how you misjudge a person?
It so happens I just bought you a surprise.
You did?
Where is it?
Right there in the garage.
You wanna see it?
I'm so excited.
Oh, it's so big.
Oh, I just No, no.
What is it?
What is it?
- What is it?
- A table saw.
A table saw?
You know something?
You're crazy.
- Don't you want it?
- I should say not.
Okay, I'll use it myself.
- Are you sure you can deliver it today?
- Oh, certainly.
Now, our neighbours will most likely be home.
But in case they're not, you can leave it in their garage.
Here you are.
I wonder if there's any way of wrapping something that big?
What?
But Certainly.
Yes, I could have that delivered in a furniture carton.
Thank you.
Are you going uptown by any chance?
Yes, I am.
May I give you a lift?
Yes.
I have to get up to my shop for a while.
Okay.
Mr. Stephens, I've just got to ask you something.
What is it?
Did you ever do any prizefighting?
Hazel Carter.
How will I ever explain you to her?
I beg your pardon?
She has a very suspicious mind.
If I tell her about the rocker, there goes the surprise.
Well, can't you just ask her not to say anything?
Are you kidding?
Western Union takes from her.
Maybe we can slip out.
No, no.
Now, why take a chance?
I'll go make a phone call, and I'll meet you outside.
Okay?
Well, thanks.
Hazel, what are you doing here?
Oh, hello, Darrin.
Going to the antique show.
- Who was that?
- Who was who?
That very attractive young lady you Have you been stung by a bee?
- What?
- Oh, nothing.
Who did you say she was?
A client of McMann & Tate, the firm I work for.
- What's the matter?
- Your ears.
My ears?
My ears!
Oh, what's happened?
Excuse me.
I have to go.
Something's come up.
- It certainly has.
- I mean, it's an emergency.
Yeah, 10 minutes.
Bye-bye.
Excuse me.
Mr. Stephens had to leave.
An emergency came up.
He said to apologize.
So you're a client of McMann & Tate?
McMann and who?
That's what I thought.
Darrin, please.
Will you stop screaming?
I can't understand a word.
Sam, can't you understand English?
My ears.
My ears are growing.
I'm baking a cake.
Is there anything else?
Somebody put a spell on me.
Why are you always looking for someone to blame?
What?
- You don't think I'm responsible.
- Could be.
I've got a meeting with Larry and a client who's hanging by a thread.
I've been working on the presentation for weeks.
How can I go to the office like this?
Oh, you're not at the office?
No, I stopped somewhere on the way.
There's someone at the door.
I have to go.
Goodbye.
Sam?
Sam?
- Oh, hello, Hazel.
- Hi, Samantha.
The envelopes for the Community Chest drive.
- I thought you were gonna mail them.
- Well, I decided to drive by and save the postage.
- What?
How's Darrin?
Fine.
No, I mean his ears.
You saw them?
Him?
Well, I ran into him at the Barkley Hotel, and we started talking and, well, suddenly they started to sort of bloom.
What were you and he talking about?
Well, he was with this person and I asked him who this person was and he told me, and his ears blew up.
Was it a man or a woman?
- Who?
- This person.
Oh, well, I really didn't notice.
Oh, come on, Hazel.
Very well, Samantha.
But remember, I didn't volunteer the information.
Sam?
Sam, where are you?
Right here.
What is it?
What is it?
What do you think?
Look.
And I finally figured it out.
Your mother put a spell on me this morning.
Now, where is the old hag?
Darrin, that is no way to refer to my mother.
I know, but I'm trying to be polite.
I have no idea where she is.
You're being awfully cool about this whole thing.
- Don't you realize the spot I'm in?
- Oh, I realize it but I'm not sure you do.
- What?
- Darrin where did you go this morning?
- I went to I stopped in to see a client.
I can't believe my ears.
Yours?
What about mine?
Hello?
- Where the devil are you?
- I'm home.
I know that, idiot.
What about our appointment with Grayson?
He'll be here any minute.
Larry, I'm not in any condition to come to the office today.
I'm afraid you'll have to carry the ball yourself.
Are you crazy?
What do I know about the presentation?
- You've done all the work on it.
- I'm not well.
- Are you dying?
- No.
- Then get in here.
- Larry, I'm really sorry.
Sorry won't feed the bulldog or your wife and child.
Now, are you coming?
No.
Then I'll bring Grayson out there.
But, Larry, you can't do that.
Larry?
Larry, come back.
They're coming over here.
What am I gonna do?
What am I gonna say?
Are you just gonna sit there?
Aren't you gonna help me?
If I were a mortal woman, I wouldn't lift a finger.
But luckily for you, I'm above that sort of thing.
Or I'm supposed to be.
Let me think.
First, we'll need a beehive.
Yeah.
Right.
A beehive?
And I'm very happy to meet you, Mr. Grayson.
Darrin's on the patio.
Thanks, Sam.
This way, Mr. Grayson.
Just remember, I've got a plane to catch.
Hello?
What?
What's that getup for?
I'm just working with my bees.
It's a hobby of mine.
- Since when?
- I took it up very recently.
Nice to see you, Mr. Grayson.
Nice to see you, Stephens, so to speak.
Darrin, it's Mrs. Kravitz.
She insists upon speaking to you.
Well, honey, I can't talk to her now.
I'm busy.
Take a message.
No!
She might take offence.
Excuse me.
Darrin, Mr. Grayson has to catch a plane.
He hates to hurt anybody's feelings.
He doesn't seem to care about mine.
- Yes, Mrs. Kravitz?
- Oh, I just wanted to tell you they delivered your present.
It's in the garage.
My, what a big box.
It's a rocking chair.
Oh, isn't that nice, a rocking chair.
Yes.
Thanks very much, Mrs. Kravitz.
I'll be over and pick it up later.
And when I see your wife, I'll tell her what Abner gave me and then she'll know what a gem she's got.
Her husband doesn't buy her an idiotic present lik e a table saw.
Let's get out of that ridiculous outfit and let's get down to business.
Now, let's see Now, are you gonna take that off?
- Larry, I can't.
- Why not?
Because of his allergy.
He's allergic to bees.
Yes, and I can't take the chance in case In case one of his bees is loose.
- That's right.
- Lf you're that allergic why on earth did you pick this hobby?
Well, you really don't pick a hobby, it sort of picks you.
Know what I mean?
No.
For Pete's sake, let's get on with this.
- Right.
- I'll go make some coffee.
Now, here's a logo that we think should replace your present one.
It's very good for colour television.
Although, it reproduces very well in black and white.
If you'll just make those amendments we'll have a basis for further conversations.
Thank you, sir.
I'm sorry if I inconvenienced you.
What did you think of that idea of his?
The guy in the beekeeper's mask saying: "Don't set stung, buy Grayson's".
He was just joking.
- I liked it.
- It's a terrific idea.
A satisfactory explanation?
- You're kidding!
- It's not for me.
I trust you implicitly, in spite of my doubts.
But Mother will not take off that spell until you explain.
Suppose you explain to me what gives your mother the right to bug my telephone calls.
Darrin, how can I explain my mother?
That's true.
Besides, you did lie about everything.
Suppose I've got a logical explanation?
That's all Mother's asking for.
I'm sorry, but this is urgent.
Mr. Stephens That's marvellous.
That is marvellous.
Sweetheart, don't worry about her.
We have a bigger problem.
Now, about that explanation.
Okay, but you're gonna feel awfully foolish.
I hope so.
I wanted it to be a surprise, but You know that rocker you were so wild about?
I bought it for you.
Oh, Darrin, you didn't.
I left my name with the dealer and she called this morning to tell me it was available.
That was the woman that Hazel saw me with.
Oh, my goodness.
You were right, I do feel foolish.
I bought it to make you feel good.
Well, I feel good and foolish.
I can't wait to tell Mother.
Oh, marvellous.
Keep that up and you'll be able to go sailing in a canoe.
Wait until I tell you about the chair Darrin bought me.
I heard.
Do you believe all that rubbish?
- What rocker?
Where is it?
- For your information it's sitting right across the street in Mrs. Kravitz's garage.
A likely story.
Mother, if Darrin says that's where it is Sam, let's not argue with Miss Know-lt-All.
Follow me.
Come on.
Come on.
Gladys, you're hysterical again and there's no reason.
Tomorrow I'll call the store and tell them they took Mr. Stephens' carton by mistake.
And they'll bring it back and take the table saw.
There you are.
Wait a minute, hon.
You're still positive there's no rocker in there?
I say you're bluffing.
In that case, would you like to make a wager?
Darrin, don't you think getting your ears back to normal is enough?
Honey, please.
For the first time in years, I've got her over a barrel.
If I'm right, would you like to take a little trip, for about a year?
And if you're wrong you'll do the same?
- Absolutely.
- Darrin.
- Please, honey, don't worry.
Goodbye, Endora.
Bon voyage, Dumbo.
And while he's gone, you and I are going to live it up for a change.
Something's terribly wrong.
I've gotta get ahold of Mrs. Kravitz.
First, get ahold of yourself.
I thought I heard somebody out here.
- What are you wearing that for?
- I've gotta talk to your wife.
Well, you can't.
I just gave her a sedative, and she's out like a light.
Going to a costume party?
Yes.
No.
When will she wake up?
Not until tomorrow if I'm lucky.
Boy, was she hysterical.
I told her they'd bring your carton back tomorrow.
I've gotta talk to her right now.
"My carton"?
I guess I shouldn't have said anything.
Tell her what was in the carton.
Not me.
I don't wanna spoil the surprise.
It was a rocking chair, wasn't it?
You spoiled your own surprise.
That's okay, Mr. Kravitz.
We've already had a few surprises today.
Tell Mrs. Kravitz I hope she feels better.
Oh, she'll be all right.
It all happened when she came back from your house screaming about your Would you do me a favour, just for my own peace of mind?
Take that off.
Yes.
Well, that does it.
Back she goes to the psychiatrist.
I may not wait till she wakes up.
You're never wrong, huh?
Suddenly, I find this whole affair incredibly boring.
I'm leaving.
- For a year?
- Oh, don't be absurd.
Do you know what your mother is?
A welsher.
She's got the character of a worm, and furthermore And furthermore, why don't we go home and take advantage of her absence, even though it's only temporary?
I still say that that is the best idea I've heard today.
Tabatha's asleep.
Good.
And it only took two choruses of "Three Blind Mice".
Oh, Darrin.
Oh, this chair is a dream.
To me, it was a nightmare.
I'm sorry.
I can't get over your thinking I was fooling around with that antique dealer.
Well, she is a very attractive woman, don't you think?
Believe me, I never gave her a second thought.
Really?
You don't understand, Sam.
I don't look at other women, because you're the one woman in the world What's the matter?
All I can say is: Mother!
Mother!
- Why bother her?
- What?
Watch.
Darrin I don't think that's the least bit funny.
Well, I got a good laugh when I put them on at the joke shop.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Tabatha, that's a nice dinner for a nice little girl.
I eated that chicken.
Yes, I know.
Now, if you eat everything on your plate you'll see a picture of a pretty bunny.
That goes for the spinach too, young lady.
Sam, are you still feeding Tabatha?
You better get ready.
We'll be late for the Hunt Club Ball.
Sweetheart, I am ready.
Oh, yeah.
Well, then could you help me find my cuff links?
What you got in your hand?
My cuff links.
I'm sorry, honey.
I guess I'm a little nervous.
But the ball chairman is the head of Chappell Baby Foods.
He's a hot prospect.
Larry thinks we can clinch his account tonight.
- I just don't want to be late.
- Don't worry.
We're right on schedule.
Sure, and your mother's not here yet, that's right on schedule too.
Darrin, it just so happens I have a little surprise for you.
Mother wasn't available, so I made other arrangements.
Other arrangements?
What kind of other arrangements?
Well, we have a new babysitter.
You'll adore her.
Who?
Who am I going to adore?
Her name's Elspeth.
And?
And she's wonderful with children and very dependable and And?
And when I was a little girl she was my nanny.
And she's a witch.
Sam, there's not room for another witch in this house.
The broom closet is full.
Darrin, no one travels by broom anymore.
It's obsolete.
I don't care if she shows up riding on a vacuum cleaner.
You'll have to send her back.
Well, all right, sweetheart.
But we have to have a babysitter.
Let's see.
Oh, I could try and get Aunt Clara.
She does tend to goof up a bit, though, doesn't she?
I could try and contact Mother again.
You have a choice.
- That's some choice.
- There's one more.
We could stay home until Tabatha's 21.
Okay, Elspeth can sit for us, but just this once.
You'll like Elspeth.
She's really just plain folks.
She's here.
Elspeth's here.
Elspeth's here.
Hey.
Hello, folks.
Hello.
Hello, love.
Hello, Samantha.
Yep.
She's just plain folks all right.
Let me look at you, Samantha.
Samantha, you are the lady.
And a beauty into the bargain.
Can this be the same little girl who used to scrape up her knees learning to walk through walls?
Oh, wasn't I a mess?
I remember the first time you made yourself invisible.
You made everything vanish except your pigtails.
So this must be the mister.
How sweet and kind it looks.
Samantha, it needs a bit of fattening.
All skin and bones.
Not to worry.
Now I've come to stay.
Come to stay?
Elspeth, I think Tabatha.
I'd know that angel face anywhere.
Oh, hello.
Say hello to Nanny Elspeth.
Oh, we're going to be great friends.
Listen, Elspeth Spinach.
What child could abide the stuff?
- Samantha.
- Oh, Darrin, it isn't really ice cream.
It's Elspeth's special spinach sundae.
But, oh, how it fooled us little ones.
Just a taste, love.
That's a good girl.
Isn't she wonderful?
Let's just have a talk about that.
- When?
- Now.
Sam, she can't stay.
All right, sweetheart.
Anything you say.
I'll break it to her gently.
Tomorrow.
- Sam.
- How could you do it to me?
How could you?
- You ungrateful children.
- Butt out, Endora.
You're supposed to be unavailable, so unavail yourself out.
You keep quiet, you treacherous clod.
How could you bring a stranger into this house to look after my grandchild?
I can see the handwriting on the wall.
I shall become a stranger in my own daughter's house.
- Mother.
- What?
Look, Elspeth is just a nanny, but you're Tabatha's grandmother.
Nothing can change that.
You know darn well you're not being replaced.
Tabatha and I are getting on famously.
I've fed her Oh, Endora, how are you?
You see?
That creature is already worming herself into the child's affections.
All right, my dear.
If you want to play the martyred mother, it's fine with me.
So long, Granny.
Don't call us, we'll call you.
Perhaps a zipper will help to keep that mouth shut.
For shame, Endora.
The mister don't stand a chance against witchcraft.
It ain't sporting.
That baggage has got to go.
She stays till I say so.
All right, Dobbin.
Remember you said that.
Elspeth, welcome to our home.
Thanks, milord.
What are we standing around for?
Elspeth, put Tabatha to bed.
Yes, milord.
There.
Now, we'll just go to beddy-bye.
Now, this is what I call a perfect way to spend an evening.
Music in the air and you in my arms.
And no mother-in-law babysitting in my living room.
I feel like a 16-year-old.
For a 16-year-old, you're a very good kisser.
Darrin.
Will you cut that out?
What if somebody sees you?
Let them eat their hearts out.
The somebody I'm talking about, Darrin is Roy Chappell of Chappell Baby Foods.
I wanna steer him out here to meet you and we can sew up the account.
And I don't want him to catch you playing post office.
He won't catch us.
We'll neck in the bushes.
Do you mind?
Darrin, Roy Chappell is a rough, tough, self-made man.
He wants a hard-nosed idea man to give him a hard-hitting campaign.
That lipstick you're wearing doesn't make you look like the man for the job.
Now wipe it off.
Stick your chest out.
And think tough.
Sweetheart, maybe you should run home and change into a lumber jacket.
Don't let Larry frighten you, honey.
I can handle Roy Chappell.
Remember, tonight, I'm a tiger.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
I'm sorry to barge in like this.
But I just had to have you meet a friend of mine.
Darwin, may I present Lord Clive Montdrako of lpswich Elspeth's former employer.
Present employer.
You have stolen my servant, sir.
- You are no gentleman.
- Oh, good grief.
Clive knows all about gentlemen.
He's the only warlock in the House of Lords.
Stolen Elspeth?
Sam, what's he talking about?
Confound it, sir.
Stop trying to involve your wife in this matter.
Aren't you man enough to stand accountable for your actions?
Him?
He's not man enough to pull on stretch socks.
He is too.
Well, perhaps I can shame him into facing his obligations.
A tango.
Just the thing.
Oh, Darrin.
Well, at least this time, sir, you rose to the occasion.
You look like Carmen.
If you're going to make a comment, it could be a bit more amusing.
Well So where is this Stephens guy?
I'm anxious to meet the man who's gonna sell my baby food.
He's gotta be a real heavyweight.
Don't you worry about Darrin.
He's a man's man.
Hey, buddy boy.
Darrin.
This is a man's man?
He's got a rose in his teeth.
Well, sure, he Darrin, why do you have a rose in your teeth?
Everybody tango.
I can explain, Roy.
It's very simple.
I can explain.
I can.
I can?
And that darn rose was stuck in my teeth till we left the party.
Which was immediately.
I should have known something would happen to foul things up.
You'd better go back to Lord What's-His-Name.
Don't worry yourself about His Lordship, sir.
His bark's far worse than his bite.
Even if that's so, Elspeth you should have told me about Montdrako in the first place.
What?
That harmless old stick-in-the-mud?
Believe me, you won't see him again.
He wouldn't have come here in the first place if it hadn't been for Endora.
I bet she had to drag him by the ears.
Comfy, sir?
Well, yes, thanks.
But listen, Elspeth Elspeth, why didn't you tell me about Lord Montdrako?
Because he's got no claim on me, he hasn't.
I give him me notice, I did.
I got plain fed up waiting hand and foot on the old geezer.
Like a blooming baby, he was.
It's so much nicer staying here with a lovely child like Tabatha.
Elspeth, about staying here Such an intelligent child, sir.
Takes after you in that respect.
Martini, sir?
Yes, thanks.
She is pretty bright, isn't she?
Elspeth, what Mr. Stephens is trying to tell you is that your staying here is absolutely That's okay, honey.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Well, it's settled then.
I've got a new home.
There, that's better.
But I hate stuffed fish.
Darrin, Roy Chappell will be here in a few minutes.
And this time I want you to make the right impression.
Don't forget, he's an outdoor man.
A big-game hunter.
So try and look rugged.
Here, smoke one of these.
Listen, Lar Well, sir, are you now prepared to conduct yourself like a gentleman?
You're supposed to be back at your castle.
Oh, no.
You won't get rid of me until you've done the proper thing and restored my Elspeth.
Elspeth has a mind of her own.
She doesn't wanna work for you anymore.
She quit.
Only because you lured her here.
Oh, no.
You can't weasel out.
I shall hold you responsible.
Me?
Now, look, this is my place of business.
If you want to talk about nannies, talk to my wife.
Oh, dear, still trying to get your poor wife to stand up for you, aren't you?
Very well.
If you insist on acting like a spineless weakling, look the part.
This is your last chance to change your attitude.
When next we meet, either I shall get satisfaction or else you shall suffer the consequences.
Sam.
Sam.
Here we are, slugger.
I brought old Roy over to He traded in his rose for a lily.
Nice.
That's it.
That's the last straw.
You got it all wrong, Roy.
There's a great reason for It's a great reason, Roy.
Listen, let's have a little lunch and a few drinkie-poos.
Roy?
And I had to hide in the supply room until my clothes changed back from Little Lord Fauntleroy.
That's your harmless warlock for you.
But, sir, he wouldn't have done a thing if Endora hadn't pushed him to it.
I know what Mother did, Elspeth.
What I don't know is what the count may do.
Now, you'd better go back.
Samantha, ain't you being a bit hasty?
Hasty, "schmasty".
Let's put it this way.
You're fired.
Bravo.
There's an end to it.
Elspeth, get your things.
And you, sir, your honour has been acquitted, at least partially.
Well, Elspeth, don't lallygag there.
It'll soon be teatime.
Well, put your own kettle on and stick your head in it for all I care.
I'm not going.
Not going?
This is your doing, sir.
Oh, no.
No.
She's going.
Go ahead.
Fly away.
Walk through the wall.
Vanish.
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't want to cause hardship, but I have my feelings.
It seems Endora is right.
You, sir, have no control over your own household.
You're a mere reflection of a man.
A mere reflection.
You have Elspeth, and I shall have satisfaction.
The mister's gone.
It's all my fault.
Oh, please.
What did you do with Darrin?
Please.
Don't bother to plead with me.
I detest scenes.
Darrin?
Sweetheart?
I know you're here somewhere.
Sam.
Here, Sam.
Sam.
Coming, sweetheart.
Sam.
Here, Sam.
Now he is a reflection of a man, and only His Lordship can release him.
What can we do?
I don't know, Elspeth, but I'll think of something.
Sam, get me out of here.
It's cold.
Pull yourself together, Elspeth.
Crying won't help.
We must think.
Yes, think, love.
You know, I still can't imagine how Endora got His Lordship to leave the castle.
I can't think that one out.
Elspeth.
You said he was an old stick-in-the-mud.
Always sitting all alone.
Now, were you the only company he had in all the years you worked for him?
I should say so.
His Lordship was practically a hermit.
Well, no wonder he wants you back, Elspeth.
You're more of a nanny for him than you are for Tabatha.
You can say that.
Hold the fort, Elspeth.
I'm on my way to the castle.
- His Lordship's castle?
- Wish me luck.
All right, now.
You round up that bunch of tourists down the road and do your duty.
Very good, mum.
Wait till I get Stephens on the horn.
He'll explain everything.
You'll see.
Look, Tate, you're loyal to your employees.
That's okay.
That I can understand.
But this Stephens is way over the hill.
They're answering.
Hello?
Stephens' residence.
Hello, this is Larry Tate.
Put Mr. Stephens on the phone, please.
Tell him that Roy Chappell and I are very anxious to speak with him.
Mr. Stephens can't speak with no one.
He's gone through the looking glass.
Must be a bad connection.
I thought she said She couldn't have said that.
So now he's Alice in Wonderland.
Tate, take me to see Stephens.
To his house?
But, Roy Listen, I didn't climb to the top of the baby food pile by letting some practical-joking yo-yo like Stephens put me on for a few laughs.
I want to give him a hunk of my mind at close range.
Come on.
Roy, I'm sure Stephens wouldn't pull a joke like that on anyone.
Well, there now.
Wasn't that utterly fascinating?
One of the most valued gun collections in all of England.
Come, come.
Come, come.
Right this way, ladies and gentlemen.
No need to push, plenty of room for all to see.
Now we're in the great hall of the Castle Montdrako.
What's going on?
Who's here, I say?
Good afternoon, Your Lordship.
You're just in time to meet your first tour group.
My first what?
Now, see here, missy If you'll look upwards toward the ceiling, you will notice an ever so And what are you doing standing over there in that ridiculous outfit?
Listen.
Legend has it that when strangers enter this hall the ghost of lpswich Downs makes that very tapestry fly up and wave to you.
Oh, look how they run and scream and giggle.
There's nothing like a good scare.
By Jove, what fun.
Standing over there, by the door is the suit of armour worn by the first Earl of lpswich, who, in his time danced his way into the hearts of many a young lady.
Oh, he must be the owner of the castle.
Oh, a real lord.
Now, see here, ladies Your Lordship, you have such a lovely castle.
Oh, yes.
And that haunted tapestry.
How ever do you do it?
Madame, I assure you I'll bet you have lots of tricks up your sleeve.
Madame, I assure you.
It's a shame you won't be getting down to London.
We're at the Savoy, room 672.
I'm dreadfully sorry, ladies, but His Lordship is rather busy at the moment.
Would you care to rejoin the tour?
Yes, of course.
We'll be in town for two weeks, Your Lordship.
Don't forget to visit the tower.
The enchanted bells are in the tower.
All right, ladies and gentlemen.
Follow me.
We will go into the library where I shall show you the collection of armour.
I shall make the bells chime themselves.
Yes, that should tickle their little fancies.
Yes.
I shall make a small spell.
Well, Your Lordship, why not let Elspeth do it?
She's ready to come back and work for you.
Elspeth?
Why should I want that wench underfoot when I have things to do?
They did say the Savoy, didn't they?
Oh, Your Lordship.
Samantha, Samantha, you sly puss.
You've let the sunlight in for me.
How can I thank you?
Well, you were just trapped behind a wall of indifference.
That wasn't too difficult to tear down.
But you've got Darrin behind a wall of glass.
Say no more.
It is undone.
I'm Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Sweetheart.
Sweetheart, you're free.
- I'm I'm out of the mirror.
- Yes.
It was cold Cold in there.
I'm freezing.
- Oh, well, I think I can take care of that.
- Yeah.
Warmer?
A little.
I'm still cold.
These gentlemen have been waiting to see you, sir.
Well, let them wait.
I'm busy.
Sorry to interrupt, Darrin, but old Roy wanted to talk to you.
Now, look, old Roy.
If you're waiting for an explanation, you're wasting your time.
I'm a pretty good advertising man.
If you want to take advantage of that, it's okay with me.
But you'll have to take me just the way I am, period.
No explanations.
Stephens, I came over here to sock you in the bazoo for putting me on.
But now that I know what your game was, I'm with you.
Shake, pal.
We got a deal.
That's great.
You know what my game is?
Oh, good old Larry.
You knew all the time, didn't you, Larry?
But I let Elspeth set old Roy wise.
I should have let Mr. Stephens tell you about how everybody tried to act like the man Mr. Chappell wanted and nobody had the courage to act like himself.
Nobody except you.
No, sir.
I admire that, fella.
I admit you did some pretty wild things.
Come on, Roy, it takes a pretty sharp idea man to come up with a rose in the teeth, right?
Yes, sir.
Darrin, go on with your kissing.
You son of a gun.
- Good night.
- Good night, Sam.
Good night.
Elspeth, you told them I planned?
I mean, I'm glad Mr. Chappell signed.
You told them l?
Oh, sweetheart, a good nanny has many talents.
Elspeth, show Mr. Stephens how you can disappear.
Yeah.
Dis Why?
Why should she disappear?
I'm old enough to kiss my best beau without a chaperone.
Well, in that case, disappear.
Oh, isn't it loverly.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
I don't know.
I just don't know.
Sam, please, I have no more time to be a Christmas tree.
I've got a 9:30 meeting with a new client.
Now, sweetheart, it'll only take a second and it's easier than lugging the real tree around.
Come on, honey, let's just put it where it was last year.
Oh, I don't know.
Well, all right, all right, let's try it.
Well, spread your arms, sweetheart, so I can get an idea of the width.
How's this?
Darrin, trees don't stand that way.
Sag your branches a little.
- That's better.
- And that's it.
I'll see you tonight.
Don't forget to pick the tree up on the way home.
- No, honey, I won't.
- And last year's tree was a little skimpy on one side, so don't buy the first one you see.
Sam, believe me, no matter how spectacular the first tree I see is, I won't buy it.
But I still don't know where to put the No.
Perfect!
Merry Christmas.
Mr. Tate, I started out life as a poor boy.
Now I'm one of the richest men in America.
Do you know why?
- No, sir.
Why?
- Three things: Persistence, prudence and punctuality.
The three P's.
The three P's.
I must remember that.
Yes, sir, those three little P's have served me all my life.
I never violate them, and I won't stand for it when others do.
- Absolutely right.
Good, then you'll understand when I say your man is late and I'm leaving.
- Wait a minute, Mr. Mortimer l'm sure there's a very good reason for Darrin to be I'm sorry I'm late.
But you know what traffic is on the day before Christmas.
- I said there was a good reason.
- I know you did and I'm still waiting to hear it.
Oh, right.
Let's get to it, Darrin.
You know, tell Mr. Mortimer the lead concept you have for Mortimer Instant Soups.
Slow down, Larry.
This was a get-acquainted meeting.
We planned to present your campaign brochure after the Christmas holidays.
- Did we?
- Yes, Larry, we did.
Mr. Stephens, time is money, and I see no reason to waste it.
That's right.
Waste not, want not.
- Christmas is just another day to me.
- Me too.
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, it's hard to tell the difference.
Gentlemen, we're running late.
We'll have to discuss your campaign for Mortimer Soups tonight.
- Be sure you're prepared.
- But tonight is - Right, tonight it is.
- Good.
At my house.
- Dinner at 6, promptly.
- But Promptly it is.
Larry, what are you doing?
I can't make it tonight.
I promised Sam we'd decorate our Christmas tree.
Darrin, Mortimer Instant Soups is a $500,000 account.
That kind of decoration doesn't grow on Christmas trees.
I'm sorry, Larry, but a promise is a promise.
Then I'll make you a promise.
I promise the meeting will be short and sweet.
And I don't like the way Mortimer steps all over everybody.
For the money we're talking about, a couple of footprints won't kill you.
Besides, we'll be out of there by 8.
Just leave it to your old Uncle Larry.
Yes, gentlemen, when I think of Mortimer's Instant Soups I don't think of a powdered product that comes out of a cold, heartless box.
No, indeed.
I think of something that a mother would have made with her own loving hands.
- Hawkins, this coffee's cold.
- I'm sorry, sir, it's a fresh pot.
- But I'll make another one.
- Get some fresh cups, Hawkins.
- Yes, sir.
- No, thanks, mine's fine.
- Delicious, as a matter of fact.
- Mine's delicious too.
But cold.
- Time's passing, gentlemen.
- It certainly is getting late.
Exactly, so let's get back to business.
Mr. Mortimer, I'm sorry, but this is Christmas Eve and my wife is expecting me home early.
You know I don't believe in all this Christmas fuss.
It's crass commercial nonsense.
It's It's Try "humbug".
Darrin.
So if you gentlemen will excuse me - Where are you going, Stephens?
- Where are you going, Stephens?
Out to participate in a little Christmas nonsense.
It's late, and I still have a tree to buy.
I'm not paying your advertising agency $500,000 so you can run out and buy a tree on my time.
Mr. Mortimer, there's a time for soup, and there's a time for sugarplums.
And that time, for me, is now.
So good night, gentlemen.
- Stephens, this meeting isn't over.
- Yes, Stephens.
- Stephens, you come back here.
- Stephens, come back here.
Larry was really a little shook up but I know he'll handle Mortimer beautifully.
In a pinch, old Lar always comes through.
Let me help you with the tinsel, honey.
This one branch is a little bald.
I wonder what Mr. Mortimer has against Christmas.
Probably the fact that people don't give Mortimer Soup as gifts.
More tinsel, honey.
What are you doing?
I asked for more tinsel.
I gave it to you.
Honey, one piece of tinsel is not the same as more tinsel.
One piece at a time is the way to hang tinsel.
It gives the tree that delicate, lacy look.
Hon, it's a Christmas tree, not a doily.
Oh, I'll get it.
You keep working.
Here you go.
One at a time.
- Oh, hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
I'd like you to meet Mr. Mortimer.
Mrs. Stephens.
Merry Christmas, Mr. Mortimer.
I hope we're not interrupting anything.
Not at all.
Come on in.
Put your coats down.
Sweetheart, you'll never guess who's here.
Who?
- Surprise.
- I'll say.
Well, Mr. Mortimer and I had a very productive meeting after you left.
We came up with some great ideas.
Since I knew you'd be dying to hear them we didn't wanna keep you in suspense.
Stephens, we came here to talk business.
Mr. Mortimer, nobody works on Christmas Eve.
Except Santa Claus.
- How about a nice cup of eggnog?
- No, thank you, young lady.
Stephens, we're wasting time.
Either we talk business, or I'm leaving.
- Which is it to be?
- I'll walk you to the door.
Darrin.
Mr. Mortimer, Larry l'll be delighted to join you in a business discussion the day after tomorrow.
Stephens, I take your refusal as a personal rejection.
- I certainly didn't intend it that way.
- Nobody rejects Jesse Mortimer.
Tate, I want this man on my account or there won't be an account.
He has 10 seconds to change his mind.
Darrin, change your mind.
Sweetheart, I can finish trimming the tree myself.
Samantha, I am going to help you finish the tree then you're going to help me get the Santa Claus suit for Tabatha's surprise in the morning.
- Two seconds.
- I refuse to be intimidated.
- It's a matter of principle.
- Time's up.
Gentlemen, Mortimer Soups will take its business elsewhere.
No, wait, Mr. Mortimer.
Mr. Mortimer, wait.
I can explain everything.
Darrin was just Mr. Mortimer?
He's gone.
A $500,000 account.
Darrin, how could you do this to me?
Especially at Christmas.
What surprises me is Larry.
I know he's got chronic dollar signs in front of his eyes, but you'd think he'd give them a Christmas vacation.
Mr. Mortimer's the one with the problem.
Well, he really seems to hate Christmas.
You know, I bet he doesn't even believe in Santa Claus.
Can't blame him for that.
After all, he doesn't have your inside information.
What a pretty little girl you are, Tabatha.
And how you've grown since Santa saw you last year.
Boy, am I beat.
Imagine going through life with that kind of attitude toward Christmas.
Well, think of all the fun he's missing.
And all the fun he'd like the rest of us to miss with him.
It's a waste.
A real waste.
There must be some way of reaching that man.
Everybody's got a reaching point.
Darrin, I have an idea.
- Darrin.
- Sure, Sam, anything you say just don't get involved with any Humbug.
Hawkins!
Hawkins!
Hawkins!
You're gonna wake the entire neighbourhood.
Who the devil are you?
Why, you're You're Mrs. Stephens.
Who gave you permission to invade my house?
Don't think of me as Mrs. Stephens.
Think of me as the spirit of Christmas.
- Poppycock!
- I had a feeling you'd say that.
I'll give you just five seconds to get out of here.
Well, you leave me no choice.
I guess I'll just have to tell you the simple truth.
I'm a witch.
One second.
You You broke my clock.
I don't know what trick you used, but you broke my clock.
- You'll have to pay for it.
- Mr. Mortimer I didn't break your clock.
I simply stopped it.
- I told you, I'm a witch.
- Nonsense.
Stop wasting my time.
There is no such thing as a witch.
Just as there's no such thing as Santa Claus?
Oh, well, I can fix that.
What the devil's going on?
You get out of this room and back into my nightmare, where you belong.
Not yet.
Not until I've given you your Christmas present.
Mr. Mortimer, you are going to take a long, long trip.
Oh, you don't get airsick, do you?
Put me down.
Put me down!
You'll hear from my lawyer about this.
So sue me.
Look down, but don't get dizzy.
Look down there.
Oh, my, isn't that lovely?
Help!
Help!
- I'm cold.
- Oh, well, that's no problem.
I can whip you up a little fur coat in no time.
Get this thing off me.
You and your tricks.
I'd rather freeze.
Well, anything you say.
He should be here in a minute anyway.
- Who should be?
Where are we?
- The North Pole.
But that's terrible.
I'm wearing my magnetic watch.
It'll be ruined.
- Samantha!
- Hello, Santa.
What a wonderful surprise.
- Come in, my dear, come in.
- After you, Mr. Mortimer.
Santa, I'd like you to meet a friend of mine.
- Mr. Mortimer, Santa Claus.
- How do you do, Mr. Mortimer?
- It's a trick.
I know it's a trick.
- Oh, a nonbeliever.
A really sad case, Santa.
Well, I guess a little convincing trip is in order, eh, Samantha?
- Right.
- Right after I finish my last shipment.
- Oh, here, let me help you.
- Thank you, my dear.
We are a little short-handed.
You too, Mr. Mortimer, make yourself useful.
In the red bag, right there.
I'm sorry I'm not my usual ho-ho self this year but it's been a very hard winter.
One thing after another with the elves.
Oh, dear.
Well, you can rest next month.
Take a trip.
Maybe a couple of weeks in Florida.
Easy with that doll, Mr. Mortimer!
That's a Suzi Bruisy doll.
When you squeeze it, it turns black-and-blue.
It's the only one of its kind in the world.
Santa, I know a little girl who'd just love that.
Oh, really?
Should I guess, or do you wanna tell me?
This is ridiculous.
I'm Jesse Mortimer of Mortimer Soups and I demand to be taken home.
Jesse Mortimer?
I don't I don't remember ever having dropped down your chimney.
Well, of course not.
You don't exist.
Who are you under that beard anyway?
- Mr. Mortimer!
- Well, I'll be glad to take you home.
But we'll have to make a few stops along the way.
And I'm sure you'll find them very interesting.
You behave yourself.
Fasten your seat belt, Mr. Mortimer.
- Seat belt in a sleigh?
- Standard equipment this year.
Well, this is Santa's last stop before we take you home.
Should we go up on the roof and meet him?
- No, wait a minute.
Isn't that Hawkins?
There you go.
Up you go.
Hold on tight.
Yes, it is Hawkins.
I knew it.
What are they so happy about?
Don't they know they're poor?
Mr. Mortimer, you're rich.
Are you happy?
Don't be so grumpy, Mr. Mortimer.
It's Christmas.
I still say humbug!
Well, here we are, Mr. Mortimer.
Home, sweet home.
Good night, Mr. Mortimer.
Sleep tight.
Oh, boy.
Hi, hon, you getting up already?
I I didn't want Tabatha to beat us to the tree.
I'll get dressed and keep her busy while you put on the rest of your Santa Claus suit.
You know something?
Santa Claus should be here very, very soon.
Hurry up, Santa, wherever you are.
A merry Christmas!
A merry Christmas!
And since Tabatha's been such a good little girl all year Santa has a whole bagful of toys for her.
- Oh, my.
- Here's a paint set for you.
And let's see what else A bear.
And a surprise.
Oh, Tabatha, isn't that wonderful?
What do you say to Santa?
Daddy.
Oh, dear.
Well, sweetheart, you were so good, I never would've guessed.
Sure.
Santa will get it.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself, Larry.
- You recognized me, huh?
- Hi, Larry.
- Everybody recognizes me.
- Daddy.
Well, almost everybody.
Ho, ho, ho, Tabatha.
This is such a lovely surprise, isn't it, darling?
Lovely.
I tore myself away from Louise and little Jonathan to come over here and apologize.
In fact, Louise insisted on it.
But if that's how you feel about it Larry.
Darrin.
Well, who are you?
Oh, Tate, it's you.
You look ridiculous.
Hi, Mr. Mortimer.
Mr. Mortimer, this is a surprise.
I hope I'm not intruding.
Not at all.
Well, I mean, it It was sort of lonely at my house.
I thought you and Hawkins were gonna stay home and celebrate humbug.
Well, I sent Hawkins and his family to Lake Placid for the holidays.
As a Christmas present.
Come right in, Mr. Mortimer.
Yeah, sit down, Mr. Mortimer, you look tired.
Well, I am tired.
I didn't get much rest last night.
I was very busy in my dreams.
Aren't you tired, Mrs. Stephens?
Me?
Why should I be tired?
Oh, well, never mind.
Here, here, let me take your hat and coat.
Mr. Stephens, Mrs. Stephens, I owe you an apology.
What I mean is We understand exactly what you mean.
- Don't we, Darrin?
- Perfectly.
I don't understand anything.
Mr. Mortimer, will you spend Christmas with us?
- Thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
- Call me Samantha.
This is for you, Darrin, Samantha.
Oh, you don't have to open it now.
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a case of Mortimer Instant Soups.
Listen, everybody, how about some old-fashioned fruitcake?
- I made it myself.
- And I'll whip up some coffee.
Irish.
You son of a gun.
- There you are, sweetheart.
- Thanks.
- How do you like it, Mr. Mortimer?
- It's delicious.
Old family recipe.
Sorry I'm late, Samantha, but I ran into some strong headwinds.
I have Tabatha's present right here.
- Oh, Santa, you shouldn't have.
- You'll never guess what it is.
Suzi Bruisy.
Oh, thank you, Santa.
- Merry Christmas, Samantha.
- I have a little present for you too.
It's something you wouldn't have bought for yourself.
- A present for Santa.
- Well, it's about time.
- Suntan lotion?
- For your two weeks in Florida.
Thank you, Samantha.
Well, I gotta be getting on my way.
I'll give you a little boost.
Here you are, darling.
Your present from Santa Claus.
And, Tabatha, hey, this is our secret.
- Secret.
- That's right.
- What was that noise?
- What noise?
Why, I thought I heard Sam, what'd you put in this fruitcake?
Nothing.
Isn't it about time for eggnog?
- Oh, Mr. Mortimer.
- You're absolutely right, Mr. Mortimer.
- Right this way.
- Merry Christmas, Jesse.
Come on.
Need another, Darrin?
- Not any at all, Lar.
- Oh, my.
- Away we go, honey.
- I hope so.
Thanks, sweetheart.
Mr. Mortimer?
What's that you're holding, little girl?
- Baby doll.
- Oh, that's not just a baby doll.
That's a Suzi Bruisy baby doll.
The only one of its kind in the world.
Why do I know that?
- Not any at all, Lar.
- Oh, my.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Mortimer.
- Merry Christmas.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara?
- Aunt Hi.
- Oh, hello, Samantha.
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, my goodness.
Well, your landings are getting smoother all the time.
Yes, it was rather successful.
But your chef's hat could use a little fluffing up.
Chef's hat?
What chef's hat?
- Oh, my chef's hat.
- Yes.
That's why I'm here.
I've come from the Annual Witches Cookout.
How exciting.
I made my favourite recipe sautéed pussy willow amandine.
- I'm partial to nuts.
- That sounds divine.
Did you win?
No.
As a matter of fact, I was disqualified.
Taste this, dear.
Well, now, Aunt Clara, winning isn't everything.
Well, no wonder you were disqualified.
This is fudge.
Fudge?
Oh, I really must straighten out my recipe book.
Yes, you'd better do that.
Now, you just relax.
- We can chat while I paint the house.
- Yes.
- Paint the house?
- Oh, well, I'm just touching up the trim.
- By yourself?
- Why not?
Wouldn't it be simpler just to wave on a coat or two?
I'm enjoying myself.
The other way isn't nearly as much fun.
Samantha you know, I think you're almost as confused as I am.
- Excuse me, Aunt Clara.
I'll get it.
- Of course.
Oh, my.
She does need help.
Colours harsh and colours mellow Kumquat orange and lemon yellow Turpentine and a brush of sable Send to me a painter able That was faster than the yellow pages.
What is the meaning of this?
I was in the middle of painting a portrait.
Oh, Samantha.
Samantha.
The painter's here.
It was only a magazine salesman Aunt Clara.
I'm almost afraid to ask but who is this?
I am Leonardo da Vinci, naturally.
Naturally.
Aunt Clara, we have Leonardo da Vinci in our kitchen.
Now, you have to send him back before Darrin finds out.
Certainly, dear, as soon as he paints the house.
- Aunt Clara.
- Very well.
If you insist.
I do.
Colours harsh and colours mellow Rhubarb red, eggplant purple No.
No, that's not it.
Zucchini green?
Well, don't ask me, Aunt Clara.
It's not my spell.
Help.
Help.
Help.
Come on.
I'm being attacked.
Help.
Help.
Let go.
Let go.
Let go.
Leonardo, are you all right?
- This is a man-eating contraption.
- No.
This is probably the work of some jealous artist.
Aunt Clara, I think Leonardo's gonna be here for quite a while.
I ought to get him one of Darrin's suits so he doesn't look so conspicuous.
Yes, of course.
Oh, Samantha always does it the hard way.
Now, let me see.
Skin of a lizard Fur of varmint Put da Vinci in Darrin's garment Yes, Larry?
Darrin, Mr. Pritchfield and I will be right in to discuss the Mintbrite Toothpaste campaign.
- Oh, no, don't.
- What?
Well, I'm not ready yet, Larry.
Well, we'll tak e a look at what you've got.
No.
Larry?
Larry?
Larry?
- Right this way, J.P. - Thank you.
Thank you.
Well, let's see what our young genius has come up with.
- Yes.
- Darrin?
Darrin.
Darrin.
Well That certainly is a colourful outfit.
Headed for a love-in?
Actually, Larry, I'd like to explain what this is all about.
Oh, we'd like you to.
- What I had in mind - Now, wait.
Stop the music.
Hold it.
Before you tell me let me tell you.
Okay?
- Okay.
- Shall I tell him, Stephens?
- Sure, let's not make him guess.
Alrighty.
Now, then, the outfit.
Renaissance painter, right?
Right.
So far.
But who?
Leonardo da Vinci, right?
Right.
You have a remarkable depth of perception, Mr. Pritchfield.
Well, thank you.
- Tate, are you with it yet?
- No.
But you two are having such a good time, I'll just watch for a while.
- Oh, now, don't tell me.
- Don't worry.
Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa, right?
Right.
So we use Mona Lisa's smile with Mintbrite Toothpaste, right?
Wrong.
- Stephens, I like it.
- Stephens, he likes it.
But, Larry, I have some other ideas I'd like to mention.
Darrin, we don't wanna hear any other ideas, you son of a gun.
Well, J.P., now that you've got the message, how about a little huddle with the Art Department, huh?
- Well, great.
Great.
Good work, Darrin.
You're a million surprises.
At least.
Now that you made your point I suppose you'll want to change back into the old grey flannel.
Sure thing, Lar.
We'll meet you here after we've worked out an approach at the Art Department.
- Yes, yes.
- Mr. Stephens?
- Yes.
The doors don't seem to close.
Could you pull your cape in a little?
Sure.
Sam!
Samantha!
What are you doing home so early?
And why are you wearing that ridiculous?
Don't you know?
It's my hobby.
- Dressing like famous men.
- Oh, dear.
Well, I can fix that.
Do you want to tell me or do I guess?
Aunt Clara?
Endora?
Uncle Arthur?
Well, sweetheart, Aunt Clara did drop in.
She was only trying to help.
- It's kind of hard to explain.
- Try.
Well, she wanted to get someone to help me paint the house.
Well, she just made one teeny little mistake voilà, Leonardo da Vinci.
You're not gonna tell me that Leonardo da Vinci is here in our house?
- Okay, I won't.
- But he is.
- Well - Isn't he?
Tell me.
Now, Darrin, make up your mind.
Do you wanna know or don't you?
I can't believe it.
It is kind of hard, isn't it?
Where is he?
He's in the living room with Aunt Clara.
- But she's gonna send him right back.
- Good.
Soon as she remembers how.
Great.
That brings us to the P's.
With the P's, I invented the parachute the pump, the power saw and prefabricated houses.
Before you leave the P's, let's discuss painting the house.
Sam, if it was so easy to get me out of his clothes why can't you get him out of here?
Well, sweetheart, switching your clothes is one thing but to return Leonardo to another century well, that's a much bigger thing.
That's impossible.
And Aunt Clara did it, and she's the only one who can undo it.
Right.
Oh, you do understand, don't you, sweetheart?
Yes, I think I do understand.
That's what worries me.
Come on and meet Leonardo, sweetheart.
Wait till you hear all the things he's invented.
Aunt Clara.
- Aunt Clara.
- Yes.
Where's Leonardo?
- What?
- Leonardo.
Where's Leonardo?
Well Oh, it was Oh, my stars.
Sweetheart, you check out back.
- No luck?
- No luck?
Oh, honey.
Now, don't worry.
We'll find him.
Did he invent the straitjacket?
I think I'm gonna need one.
Oh, sweetheart.
But of course.
I'm beginning to forget my own inventions.
There's one thing we all have to agree on.
If the police pick him up, we never heard of him.
No matter what he says, we never heard of him.
They'll think he's crazy, lock him up.
That'll be the end of it.
Why, Darrin, we can't do that to Leonardo.
- Darrin?
- Yeah, I guess not.
- Sweetheart, I'm sure we can find him.
- Please hurry.
Larry expects me back for a meeting with Mr. Pritchfield.
Oh, no.
Aunt Clara, you check the park.
The park?
Oh, the park.
Of course, yes.
It's so lovely this time of year.
Sweetheart, I'll check all the museums.
Now, don't worry.
We'll find him.
- Okay.
You ready?
- Yeah.
Hang on.
Hang on.
And now, if you'll be so kind as to follow me we shall have a view of the finest of modern sculpture.
Now, here we have What do we have here?
Here we have the work of Jackson Pride.
One of the finest of our living sculptors.
It's called Man in Motion.
- It was commissioned last year.
- When does the work begin?
Begin?
It's finished.
My friend, this is nothing but a block of stone, like your head.
Sir, this is a finished work of art.
And it is priceless.
Now, would you follow me, please?
I will show these frauds what a man in motion really is.
Excuse me.
Do you have permission from the curator to work here?
He wouldn't.
Can't you see this is an errand of mercy?
I am breathing life into this stone.
I don't care if you're giving it mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
He did.
All right, I've dealt with you hippies before.
- Excuse me.
- Me, a hippie?
How dare you call me that.
Samantha, you have arrived just in time.
I have been insulted.
He called me a hippie.
What is a hippie?
Lady, are you responsible for this dodo?
What did the dodo do?
- I mean, what did he do?
- Do?
He ruined this statue.
Don't you think you ought to do something about this crowd?
Oh, yeah.
All right, everybody.
Let's move along.
All right.
Move along.
Leonardo.
Leonardo.
Hebus, herbus, lightning storm Restore this stone to original form All right, we're all going to the curator's office The statue.
I don't understand it.
Well, that's modern art for you.
Come on, Leonardo.
Darrin's gonna be wondering where we are.
So this is the way they travel in the 20th century.
It's delightful.
Of course, it makes my aeroplane obsolete but I should have thought of this sooner or later.
Good.
You found him.
Get rid of him.
Darrin.
This is Leonardo da Vinci.
Delighted to meet you.
It's a great honour to meet you, Mr. Da Vinci.
Thank you.
How's Michelangelo?
Michelangelo?
That charlatan?
He painted over the cracks on an old ceiling.
Big deal.
Fascinating, isn't he?
Honey, don't you think we ought to try and find Aunt Clara.
Oh, dear, she's still in the park.
- In the park?
- Yes.
You'd better find her, and fast.
Larry and Mr. Pritchfield are on their way here.
- I couldn't stop them.
- Well, all right, sweetheart.
I'll hurry.
It's them.
This looks interesting.
Sweetheart, I'll answer the door while you pull yourself together.
- Oh, hi, Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
- J.P. Pritchfield.
Samantha Stephens.
- Well, how do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.
- Where's the genius?
- Yeah.
- Genius?
- Here he is.
- Hello, Stephens.
- Mr. Pritchfield.
Darrin, wait till you see what we've done with your Mona Lisa.
- Darrin's Mona Lisa?
- J.P. Really deserves all the credit.
Well, sometimes you have a feel for these things.
Oh, Larry, can I fix you and Mr. Pritchfield a drink?
No, thanks, Sam.
We're anxious to show Darrin the artwork.
Oh, I'm sorry we don't have a drum roll but - There we go.
- Here it goes.
Well, what do you think of our little lady, Mrs. Stephens?
Why, it's terrible.
- Ly clever and inspired.
I mean what an idea.
And what do you think of my little improvement on the smile, Stephens?
Well I think maybe it's the teeth that bother me.
We are trying to sell toothpaste.
Yes, but you don't tamper with a great work of art.
It's in bad taste.
Now, people don't go around distorting great works of art.
Be the first, start a fashion.
Stephens, I like it.
Well, I don't.
- Using the Mona Lisa was my idea.
- Oh, that's good.
Yes, you bet it's good.
And I have every intention of going ahead with it as is.
With one little change.
- Yes, sir, what's that?
- Without McMann & Tate!
You've lost a million-dollar contract.
J.P.?
When one member of the team stumbles you don't fire the coach.
- In my league, we do.
Sam, what are you doing?
Just a little delaying tactic to try and figure out a way to keep your integrity and the Pritchfield account.
- I don't want the account.
Let them go.
- But, Darrin, that's not fair.
Witchcraft got you into this mess.
Now, maybe it can help get you out.
- Wait.
- Yes.
- A brilliant idea.
- Yes?
That's what we need, a brilliant idea.
I think I've got it.
In our den is one of the greatest minds the world has ever known.
Leonardo.
Leonardo.
What do you think of this?
My Mona Lisa.
What have these barbarians done to my Mona Lisa?
This could only be the work of Michelangelo.
Well, no.
Leonardo, actually it's rather a complicated story.
You see, Darrin's client, Mr. Pritchfield intends to use your painting to sell toothpaste.
And you approve of this?
Of course we don't.
In fact, we want to get you to help us stop him.
I am ready.
Leonardo, all you have to do is come up with a brilliant idea for selling toothpaste.
That will save my Mona Lisa?
Well, certainly.
Mr. Pritchfield would forget all about her.
Then Leonardo will come to the rescue.
Now, Samantha, just a few drams of butterscotch, and it is finished.
Oh, Leonardo, the children are just gonna love this.
- Making any progress?
- It's almost finished.
Oh, wait a minute.
Please.
Mr. Pritchfield.
Larry.
I think Darrin ought to have a chance to tell you his real idea.
Well, where is Stephens?
Oh, he'll be right back.
One more day with your outfit, Tate and I'll be ready for the laughing academy.
Now, sweetheart, don't be stubborn.
Darrin has an idea for a new toothpaste especially for children.
It's something that'll make it fun for children to brush their teeth.
Darrin, you've done enough.
- I don't think you - Quiet, Tate.
I'm always ready to look at a new idea.
Go ahead, dear, tell him.
To tell the truth, when you came into the office today I was about to announce a new product.
Tooth paint.
- Tooth paint?
- Yes.
A chemist friend helped to develop it.
It's for the kids.
All they do is paint the different colours on their teeth, then rinse.
The biggest problem is getting the little tykes to brush.
Now, each colour is a different flavour.
There's cherry and lime and lemon and blueberry and grape.
- And butterscotch.
- That's the plaid one.
I'm sorry, Sam, Darrin but J.P. Is pretty much sold on this Mona Lisa thing.
Will you be quiet, Tate?
I'd like to hear more.
Of course.
So would I. J.P., there comes a time in your business when you have to make a fresh start.
We've been selling Mintbrite Toothpaste for over three years and we've exhausted the originality.
But with this new product, we open up the kids market.
- It's a whole new breakthrough.
- I'm sold.
- And then the parents will follow.
- Okay, I'm sold.
- Larry?
- Of course.
If J.P.'s happy, I'm happy.
Well, good.
Then it's all settled.
You've got quite a husband here, Mrs. Stephens.
Well, I must agree with you, Mr. Pritchfield.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, I've gotta be getting on.
We'll meet on this tomorrow.
Stephens.
Mrs. Stephens.
Mr. Pritchfield.
Well, see you tomorrow, you son of a gun.
So long, Sam.
Bye, Larry.
Leonardo.
Leonardo, it worked.
Of course it worked.
Leonardo da Vinci is a genius.
I just talked to the contractor.
He'll be here a week from Tuesday to paint the house.
- I've got some good news for you too.
- I could use some of that.
Aunt Clara remembered the spell, and she's gonna send Leonardo back in a little while.
What do you mean, "in a little while"?
Come on, I'll show you.
Aunt Clara made a deal with Leonardo.
Because he didn't paint the house, he has to paint her.
You possess an enigmatic smile.
Oh, really?
Can't you hurry him up?
Sweetheart, you can't rush a masterpiece like the Mona Clara.
Sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Mother, I'd rather do it myself.
Stop talking like a detergent commercial and come and give your mama a kiss.
- What's that you're wearing?
- It's Joie d'Anime, darling.
And you're still wearing that essence of bacon.
Darrin's breakfast.
Now he'll be down any minute so why don't you evaporate until he goes off to work.
Why don't you ask me where I've been and what's in the box.
You've been to Paris, and there's a dress in the box.
Marvellous.
You've learned to read minds.
No, I've learned to read labels.
Good morning, good morning, good morning.
Goodbye.
Sweetheart Mother just popped in to show me the latest fashions from Paris.
Yes, and I brought you something.
Something for your nice little pointed head.
Oh, Mother.
- Endora, I'm glad you're here.
- Really?
Seeing you here has made me lose my appetite.
That means I'll be on time for a very important meeting.
Bye, sweetheart.
Stay a week.
I'm on a diet.
Even his voice is irritating.
- Well, you did start it.
- No, you did when you married him.
Which reminds me, whom do you think I ran into in Paris?
- Who?
- Your old beau, Rollo.
Oh, how is he?
Oh, as charming and attractive and debonair as ever.
Why you turned him down I'll never understand.
Simple.
I met Darrin, and it was love at first sight.
It must have been.
If you'd taken a second look, you'd have run like a frightened deer.
Mother, I have a million things to do starting with saying goodbye to you.
Of course.
Rollo.
Why didn't I think of that before?
Really, Endora.
Your timing is atrocious.
I'm sorry.
Were you lunching?
With an absolutely ravishing mademoiselle.
Now I'll never know whether she said yes or no.
Oh, come now, Rollo.
No woman would ever say no to you.
- That's true.
- Except Samantha.
Don't remind me.
The only blot on my record.
How would you like to remove that blot?
Mother, this is lovely.
I'm glad you talked me into having lunch.
Of course, darling.
Even a chicken gets out of its coop now and then.
Would you care to order now or wait till the other party arrives?
What other party?
- Samantha.
- Here's our other party now.
- Where did he come from?
- I don't know.
I was just You're looking positively radiant.
Mother, I know what you're cooking up.
No reflection on you, Rollo, but What happened to madame?
If you don't mind, I would like to tell Aunt Hagatha that her babysitting services are no longer required.
Samantha, I am shocked and disappointed in you.
You're shocked?
- Oh, of all the underhanded tricks.
- My, my, my.
I didn't know you were so attracted to him.
Attracted to him?
Mother, what are you talking about?
Well, if you're so upset over the mere idea of having lunch with an old friend what other explanation can there be?
I am not upset with Rollo.
Of course, if a married woman isn't sure enough of herself to spend a few hours in a crowded restaurant with an old beau - Well, I'll be off now, dear.
- Just a minute, Mother.
No, no, no.
I understand.
I feel very sorry for you.
Things must be much worse than I thought between Darwin and you.
It's Darrin.
And there's nothing wrong between us.
Of course not.
But I'm sure you'll work the problem out.
All right.
All right, Mother.
I'll have lunch with Rollo.
Wonderful.
Here you are, monsieur, one dry Thank you.
I hope it's nice and dry.
Where's the other gentleman?
Oh, he was just And then you two I don't know.
Excuse me.
I wonder what got into Rollo?
I said we'd be right back.
Pretty sure of yourself, weren't you, Mother?
- I'll get him.
- Forget it, Mother.
Let's just have lunch Oh, look, there's Darrin.
Let me finish this before I look.
Well, well, well.
This is a pleasant surprise.
I'd say it was more in the nature of a shock.
Sweetheart, would you join us?
We'd love to have you, wouldn't we, Mother?
Thanks, Sam, we have some business to discuss.
Oh, that can wait.
I'd rather have lunch with a couple of classy chicks than sit alone with you.
Bo, this chick I mean This lady is my wife.
And this is my mother-in-law.
No kidding?
Well, some guys have all the luck.
Callahan's my name.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.
- The pleasure is dubious.
- Well, aren't you sweet.
What are you standing there for?
Sit down, sit down.
Mr. Callahan is a new client of ours.
Oh, isn't that nice?
Hey, I bet you can't guess what I make.
Enemies?
Hey, you got a funny mother-in-law.
What do you make, Mr. Callahan?
Well, this will kill you.
Perfume.
Ain't that a gas?
Look, here's a sample.
For you, bright eyes.
We just came out with it.
"Autumn Flame".
Yeah, for the older babes, you know?
He means for the more mature woman.
Oh, have it your way.
You're the advertising man.
I figure, why should just the young chicks get all the attention?
I mean, an old babe like you has a right to smell nice too, huh?
Why don't we order or something.
You know, you're giving me a terrific brainstorm.
We want somebody to sell Autumn Flame, right?
You keep telling me we need a classy older chick to do the commercials.
- Well, there she is.
- I beg your pardon.
She'd be perfect.
Smart dresser, sophisticated, still pretty good-looking.
Well Mother, you ought to be flattered.
Well, what do you think?
Well, no, no, no, it's It's out of the question.
Suppose you let me handle my own affairs.
- It's out of the question.
- All right, you think about it and let me know tonight.
- Tonight?
- I want you all for dinner at my place.
- How about it?
- Why That's very sweet, Mr. Callahan but I'm afraid it would be impossible to get a babysitter on short notice.
No problem.
We'll have dinner at your place.
Just be sure Mom's there.
Oh, she can't.
Definitely not.
She has a previous engagement.
Will you stop answering for me?
I have a previous engagement but I'll be there.
Terrific.
Hey, be sure that art director is there.
- What's his name?
- Bill Walters.
Yeah.
I want to get his thinking on this.
Well, I was planning on having dinner with dear Rollo.
But I'll bring him to your place instead.
Mother.
- Who?
- Well, I guess I'll skip lunch.
There's so many things that I must do.
I'll see you tonight, bright eyes.
Ain't she a gas?
I'm sorry about the disappearing act, darling, but it was unavoidable.
Now, where were we?
You were just telling me about your collection of Endora?
Yes.
Endora, when are you gonna stop hounding me?
When you finish your assignment, you naughty, naughty boy.
It's no use.
I've never kissed a less-responsive hand than Samantha's.
But you barely had a chance to talk to her.
Tonight you'll have a better opportunity.
Samantha's having some people to dinner, and we're invited.
Endora, it'll never work.
Well, if your fatal charm doesn't work, you'll have to think of something else.
My love potion.
Are you suggesting I use that on your daughter?
I?
Certainly not.
I'm shocked at you even mentioning it.
All I want to do is free my little girl from a life of mortal drudgery.
How you do it is up to you.
Endora, doesn't your conscience ever pain you?
No.
But now that you mention it it does tickle a bit.
You know, we don't pay peanuts for these commercials.
No, there's a lot of A lot of money involved.
I know of babes that'd give their eyeteeth to do one.
You wanna keep tally or something?
Oh, thank you, old boy.
- So you're Rollo, huh?
- That's right.
And you're Samantha's husband, huh?
That's right.
- Well - Yeah.
- Can I get you something to drink?
- You just did.
Yes.
Excuse me.
- Here's your refill, Bill.
- Thank you.
Harriet, can I get you something to drink?
It looks as if Bill is going to drink for the family.
Will you get off my back?
Excuse me.
Just don't come to me tomorrow with your hangover.
- I wouldn't come to you - Hors d'oeuvre, anyone?
- Sam.
Iovely party, Sam.
- Thank you, Bill.
I'm glad you could make it on short notice.
- Oh, we were delighted.
- Haven't seen you guys in ages.
Here, you pass these.
I'll get some more.
- Can I help?
- Yes.
Stay right here.
I don't know why you're resisting, bright eyes.
Ask these people here.
Don't you think she'd make a great Miss Autumn Flame?
If you want my personal opinion I think Endora's too young for what you had in mind.
Well, how do you know what he had in mind?
You know, Endora, what Mr. Callahan is offering is really quite an honour.
Sure.
Stephens and I auditioned hundreds of women for the job but you stand out like a ripe pickle in a bunch of green cucumbers.
You certainly have a flair for language.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Rollo.
Will you stop gaping at me and go back in the living room?
I'm sorry, Sam, I can't.
Samantha, I've forgotten how lovely you are.
Terrific.
Let's keep it that way.
Do you know the more I see you, the more I want you?
Yes, but I can't sing it now.
Okay.
That's the way it's got to be.
Dinner will be ready in five minutes.
I hope everybody's appetite's okay.
Mine sure is.
Good.
I was afraid you might drown it.
You've been rushing around so much, you haven't had a drink, have you?
Thanks, Rollo.
That's very considerate of you.
Now, look, Dora, why don't you just give in, huh?
You're going to anyway, sooner or later.
Bo Callahan always gets his way.
Why don't we have some music.
You know what they say, Bo.
You can drive a horse to water, but you can't make him drink.
You simile is not only odious but inaccurate.
He is driving me to drink.
- Endora, I wouldn't do that.
- You would if you had to listen to him.
When do we start?
When do we start the commercials you big, beautiful, utterly irresistible man?
I must've missed something.
Oh, you're the sweetest little fella.
Rollo, that was my drink, and you put something in it.
Well, it wasn't my idea.
Oh, this time Mother has gone too far.
Maybe it won't hurt for her to get a taste of her own medicine.
Sam, what's going on?
I think I'd better check my chicken.
And I think I'd better check mine.
I need a drink.
- Hello there.
- What?
Where have you been all my life?
I told you not to drink so much.
Has anyone ever told you you have eyes like a stricken fawn?
- Love potion?
- That's right.
- Rollo intended it for me.
- Oh, really?
- Well, I've got something for him.
- Darrin.
- Samantha, please help me.
- What's the matter?
Why are you running from me, beautiful creature?
Will you leave me alone?
- Bill, what's gotten into you?
- I don't know, but it sure feels great.
I don't think it was nice of you to leave my mother and Mr. Callahan alone.
What are you talking about?
They've left.
Harriet, lover, come back!
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
Sweetheart, why don't you go help Bill.
You mean Harriet, don't you?
Rollo, why didn't you stop Mother?
Are you joking?
Do you think I want to spend the rest of my life as a frog?
How long does that potion last?
Exactly one hour.
The judge will be out in a minute.
Now, you folks just relax.
Getting married don't hurt none.
Boy, I thought I made quick decisions, but you got me beat all hollow.
My head's spinning.
I don't know how we got here.
- Witchcraft, darling.
When you're in love, the whole world's witchcraft.
You do want to marry me, don't you, sweetie?
Well, yeah, sure.
It's all some kind of crazy dream anyway.
Rollo, how can you stand there and eat?
- Mother may be in terrible trouble.
- Well, how will it help her if I starve?
Samantha, is it all right if Darrin drives me home?
- What about Bill?
- I wouldn't get into a car with him.
Harriet, my love, why are you running from your sugarplum?
Bill, hold it down.
You're obviously of age, so there's no problem about that.
- Where's your witness?
- Witness?
Do we need a witness?
Sure.
You need two of them.
Edna here can stand up for one of you, but we still need somebody else.
- But we don't have anyone.
- Well, leave everything to me, darling.
Excuse me.
Rollo?
I don't like to eat and run but I'd rather your mother didn't find me when she comes out of I have a hunch she found him.
Rollo?
Oh, there you are, Rollo.
Come on in.
- You're going to be a witness.
- A witness.
To what?
Mr. Callahan and I are going to be married.
Isn't that wonderful?
What's your first name, dear?
Bo.
Where'd he come from?
Rollo's always around when I need him.
So don't worry your head about it, you dear, sweet little man.
Oh, I'll I'll I'll I'll be right back.
Don't start without me.
Don't hide your heart, my little coquette.
I know you're in there, my little love bug.
Hey, do you want me to suffocate in here, sweetheart?
If necessary.
- Where's Bill?
- Let me out.
You can't run away from love.
Where'd you come from?
Oh, out there.
I've got to talk to you, urgent.
Poopsie.
You can't run away from love.
Where is she?
Where is that divine little she-devil?
He's loose.
He's loose.
Sam, your mother's gonna get married.
I'm supposed to be the witness.
Married?
Mother?
Oh, she can't.
So you think.
They're at some justice of the peace.
- She's gonna pop me back there.
- Well, I have to stop her.
How?
She's more powerful than both of us together.
- Well, I'll think of something.
Let's go.
- Where are you, lovebird?
- Will you try to control yourself?
- What about them?
Come on.
You can't hide forever, pussycat.
- I got you.
- No, let me go.
- Let me go.
- Bill.
Bill, how about a cup of black?
Sorry, sweetheart.
All right, Rollo.
Let's go.
Samantha, how marvellous.
You've come to your mama's wedding.
Mother, you can't get married.
Mother, don't you realize you're under a spell?
I know, dear, but when you're in love, the whole world's under a spell.
Yeah, but Rollo, what's happening?
- She doesn't remember Daddy.
- It's the love juice.
It blots out everyone but the love object.
- How much time have we got left?
- Four minutes.
All right, judge.
We're ready.
Now, if you'll just join hands.
Dearly beloved Funny, I could have sworn I had my glasses on.
Can't read without them.
They were there a second ago.
Have you forgotten the ceremony?
You must have performed this a hundred times.
I guess so.
Dearly beloved we We I can't remember what comes next.
Use this and read it.
I must say, you folks came prepared for everything.
Just one moment and we'll get this over with.
Samantha.
It saddens me, Samantha, that you can't behave yourself at your own mama's wedding.
You'll have to go home and stay home.
Oh, no, you don't, Mother.
You can't get rid of me that easily.
I guess she can.
Well, if I can't go to the wedding I do.
What happened?
Where is everybody?
Now, don't worry, Mr. Callahan.
If everything goes all right, you won't remember a thing tomorrow.
Not bad, Samantha, but you're out-witched.
Proceed.
Edna, do you know what's going on?
I think so.
He's having a dream, and we're all in it.
- Where was I?
- The last line.
"I now pronounce you," et cetera, et cetera.
By the authority vested in me, I now pronounce you Oh, thank heaven.
Samantha, will you explain yourself?
Who are all these people?
She's snapped out of it, all right.
I must be losing my grip.
- She can't remember?
- It's like a huge drunk.
When it wears off, you can remember very little.
Well, Mother, I'll explain later.
But first, I think we should let these good people go home.
- Rollo?
- With pleasure.
This isn't a dream.
It's a nightmare.
What's going on?
Where do you live, Mr. Callahan?
Well, the The Town House Hotel, but Good night, Mr. Callahan.
I think I'll go and take care of the others.
- Endora, let me try and explain.
- Yes, I think you should.
Will you stop pawing me in public?
Then let me out of this hammerlock.
What's been going on?
Lt It really doesn't matter now, sweetheart.
Everything's back to normal.
She always gets this way when she's had a few too many.
Endora, I realize you're Samantha's mother and for that reason, I don't want to be rude.
So let me put it this way.
The next time you fly by this house why don't you.
Darrin, I really think that Mother's suffered enough.
Oh, don't remind me.
I shudder every time I think how close I came to calamity.
Mother, I know this is foolishly wishful, but I hope you've learned your lesson.
There is absolutely no way you can drive your witchly wedge between Darrin and me.
We made up our minds a long time ago that we belong together.
And we're very stubborn.
So won't you please give up?
Before we give you up.
Are you threatening me?
No, no.
No, no, Mother, he isn't.
He's just saying that, as guests go, he wishes you would.
Well!
You really can't help admiring her style.
She's got something else I can't help admiring even more.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
That won't do any good.
I might have known.
Why did you do that?
I wanted to ask you a question.
Why, in the name of all that's witchly, are you massaging that rug?
I'm not.
I'm cleaning it.
Why go to all that trouble?
Why not just: Isn't that a simpler way to clean a rug?
Thanks a heap.
Hello.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Mother.
Spoilsport.
I'm sorry, sweetheart, I couldn't hear you.
There was a little disturbance here.
- Really?
How is the old war wagon?
- Fine.
That's too bad.
Larry buzzed me and told me to cease firing on the Webbley Food account.
It looks like I'll be home for dinner after all.
Oh, darling, that's wonderful.
Would you like anything special?
Yeah, see if you can get rid of your mother.
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.
He's coming home.
He's coming home for dinner for the first time this week and it never occurs to you to wonder what he's been doing those other nights.
He's been working late on the Webbley Food account.
They may lose it.
And you may be losing your mind if you believe that.
I think I'll make him a pork loin.
Wouldn't it be much more fun if you turned him into a whole pig?
No wonder there's no such thing as Mother-in-Law's Day.
Sorry to stop you in midstream, Darrin but let me give you my thinking.
With Webbley Foods, we've already heard the death rattle, right?
So why bust a gut to save it when we can replace it with newer and fresher blood?
- Namely?
- I just got an inside tip that the William J. Sommers account is up for grabs.
And let's face it, we've got the inside track there, Darrin boy.
Larry, just because I used to date Sheila Sommers is no Date her?
You were engaged.
Larry, you're not asking me to use that relationship for business purposes, are you?
I'm not?
I mean, Darrin, you've got me all wrong.
All I'm saying is if we get the account we know we can do a superior job on it, right?
- I think so.
- There isn't an agency in town that's better equipped.
- I'll go along with that.
- Or more experienced.
- Right.
- So all I'm saying is will it hurt to give Sheila a call?
Larry, I will not use an old romance for personal gain.
Darrin, I won't press you.
I'll just say this: Call her.
Larry, you don't know Sheila.
She'll take this as a sign that my marriage is buckling.
That's all she needs.
She can be awfully vindictive, you know.
So can I. - Well - Good boy.
Here, I'll dial it for you.
I won't know what to say to her.
Just get on the horn and tell her it's okay for tonight.
What's okay?
When I called Sheila, she happened to mention - You called her?
- How else was I gonna talk to her?
Anyway, she and her father are gonna be at the Hearthstone and we're going to run into them invite them to join us for a little drinky-poo.
Then we'll chin-chin and maybe have a little din-din.
I just told Samantha I'd be home for din-din.
- I mean, dinner.
- Well, call her up and tell her you'll be late.
- And make me the heavy.
- That won't be hard.
- Hello?
- Sam?
Why are you out of breath?
I was just coming in when I heard the phone ring.
Hold on a minute.
Hi.
I got the most beautiful pork loin.
- Sam, I've got a problem.
- What is it this time?
Well, Larry and I are trying to line up a new client and we're going to take him to the Hearthstone for a few drinks and I guess I'll be stuck for dinner too.
Well, all right, sweetheart.
Just don't work too late.
Bye-bye.
Did anyone ever tell you you have a suspicious mind?
No such thing.
I'm merely stating a fact.
Mother, the facts happen to be that Darrin and Larry are taking a prospective client to dinner.
What's her name?
Samantha, I think you're behaving like an ostrich.
And if you'll pull your head out of the sand, you'll see that I'm right.
Mother, you just don't understand the kind of relationship that Darrin and I have.
It's a love that is based on mutual trust.
And when you have that, you don't get upset because your husband's working late.
Really?
We'll see.
They're not showing.
Let's call it off.
- Be patient.
Finish your drink.
- I have.
Charlie, another for my friend.
Darrin.
Sheila.
Well, well.
It's marvy to see you.
Well, so am I. I mean, you know Larry Tate.
Oh, of course.
How are you, Larry?
Couldn't be better.
Well, this is a pleasant surprise.
Sheila, would you mind letting go?
Now, don't tell me I'm embarrassing you.
Oh, no, no, but your pin's open, and it's sticking me.
- Sorry, darling.
- Yeah.
Where?
- I mean, who are you with?
- Nobody.
I'm all yours.
Daddy was supposed to join me, but he got hung up.
Well, as a matter of fact, I'm hung up too.
That is, I will be if I don't get home.
- I mean, get going.
- Larry.
- Have fun, you two.
- Let me look at you.
- You know, you haven't changed a bit.
- Neither have you.
Does that mean there's still that same old feeling you used to have?
My stomach?
No, that's all cleared up now.
Oh, good, our table's ready.
Wasn't that darling of Larry to get lost?
Yes.
Yes, he's a regular sweetheart.
For the last time, no.
No, no.
I will not pop into that restaurant.
- Afraid of what you'll find?
- Absolutely not.
Then why won't you go?
Because it would be the act of a desperate woman which I do not happen to be, no matter what you say.
It would also be low, deceitful and unworthy.
Very well, if that's the way you feel.
- Definitely.
- In that case your low, deceitful and unworthy mother will have to do it for you.
- Mother, don't you interfere.
That's like telling an elephant not to forget.
Food should be here soon.
Sure is great, running into you this way.
Oh, come on.
Now, you know Larry cooked it up.
Sure is great, the way Larry cooked it up.
Don't worry about getting together with my father.
I'm having a dinner party tomorrow night.
- You can see him then, okay?
- Sure.
We'd love to come.
- You wanna bring your wife?
- Yes, unless Oh, no, no.
By all means, bring her.
What did you say her name was again?
Samovar?
- Samantha.
- I knew it was something odd.
But it seems to fit her.
She really is quaint.
I wonder where our dinner is.
Oh, I see.
It makes you feel uncomfortable to talk about your wife, doesn't it?
How long have you been married?
- Four years.
- Oh, you poor thing.
Let's talk about something more cheerful.
Oh, guess who finally got married.
Shorty Richards.
- No kidding?
- Is that wild?
Yeah.
Who's Shorty Richards?
Remember, he was always falling off his elevator shoes.
Oh, little Shorty Richards.
He had the beautiful cabin cruiser.
And remember when we borrowed it and went aground in Satucket for a weekend?
We were marooned for two days.
If the food doesn't get here pretty soon, I'm going to lose my appetite.
Here it comes.
Darrin, why don't we see each other more often?
Well, because Sheila, I'm married.
Well, what does that have to do with two good friends getting together once in a while?
What?
Watch what you!
Good morning, sweetheart.
This has to go to the cleaner's.
I had a lot to tell you last night, but you'd already gone to bed.
How is that sofa for sleeping?
Oh, breakfast is ready.
Looks delicious.
Any butter?
If not, don't bother.
You know, if I didn't know better, I'd think this was last night's But that's a great way to economize, Sam.
Sam, no matter what your mother told you, that was a business dinner and I didn't lie to you.
I just didn't want you to get all worked up over nothing, that's all.
Sam, you're getting all worked up over nothing.
It was all Larry's idea.
He's dying to get Sheila's father's account to replace Webbley's account.
We were supposed to have dinner with old man Sommers last night but Sheila showed up alone.
And then Larry Well, wise guy, he went off and left.
Well, I just called him, and I told him what I thought of him.
And I informed him that you and I were not going to show up at Sheila's dinner party tonight.
She invited us?
Yeah, so that Larry and I could meet with old man Sommers.
Well, Darrin, I don't blame you for being annoyed with Larry but do you think it's fair to run out on him?
In spades.
I don't like the whole thing.
I'd much rather pitch my new concept at Webbley Foods than subject you to any of Sheila's little games.
Yeah You see, Darrin, that's just the point.
If we don't show up, that's an admission that I'm afraid to face her.
And actually, I think she's rather interesting.
In a creepy sort of way.
You're wrong.
I don't hate her at all.
- Sam, you know that's a lie.
- It is not.
Well, but I'll admit it's not the whole truth either.
What kind of gravy is this so I can tell the cleaner?
Honey, you ready?
I was just trying to figure out what to wear.
I told you what to wear.
Sheila said it was casual.
Casual.
Why is it I keep remembering the last time Sheila said it was casual?
Boy, this is some fancy-looking place.
Are you sure I'm dressed all right?
Darling, of course you are.
Sheila said it was potluck.
Very relaxed, sitting-on-the-floor kind of stuff.
- Darrin, darling.
- Sheila.
- Is this your little bride?
- How do you do.
Oh, why, Darrin, she's sweet.
Maybe I should have dressed Oh, not at all, dear.
You look sweet.
- John, would you Mrs. Stephens'?
- Sweater.
I can tell you're the type who always dresses so sensibly.
You know, the capable type.
Darrin, I bet she's good at typing, cooking taking care of the household accounts and playing golf.
You know, all those things poor little me can't do at all.
Pity.
Won't you come in and meet my friends?
Oh, no you don't, Sheila, my dear.
Not this time.
I think this will be casual enough.
I still think you're wrong, honey.
Sheila definitely said casual dress.
Well, that's what she said the last time.
You remember what happened.
She's not going to embarrass me again.
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.
- May I take your coat?
- Thank you.
Thank you.
This way, please.
- Now, remember, no: - Witch's honour.
- Oh, that little double-crosser.
- She said casual.
She knew darn well I'd expect her to lie.
Darrin, darling.
- And you're looking lovely, Eila.
- It's Samantha.
Oh, but I'm sure I told you to dress casually.
- Yes, but - Well, we have to drop in at a dress-up affair later on this evening.
That's right.
We have to drop up at a dress-in later.
Well, come and meet everybody.
You all know Darrin Stephens.
- Hi, everybody.
- Darrin, my boy, it's been too long.
Good to see you, Mr. Sommers.
And this is Darrin's darling little wife, Samara.
Samantha.
Dick and Julia Thompson.
Ralph Martinson.
Vern and Alice Richter.
Dodie Brooks.
- Hello.
- Larry, where's Louise?
She had babysitting trouble.
But I thought your mother-in-law was visiting.
That's the babysitter she's having trouble with.
Larry.
- The barbecue is ready, miss.
- Oh, good.
Everyone out in the garden.
I'm putting you in my will.
Barbecue.
You don't have an extra one of those, do you?
I hope you don't mind roughing it like this.
Everything all right up there, Santana?
It's Samantha.
Just fine.
- Incidentally, I love your hair.
- Thank you.
It's a much more becoming shade than you had before.
Well, my hairdresser's a marvel.
Especially with problem hair.
Would you like his name?
Sheila, do you ever see Rod Lamport?
Oh, well, you have been out of circulation, poor boy.
Come here.
Well, anyone who knows Rod knew that marriage wouldn't work.
I mean, she was a nobody.
Nobody knew where she came from or who her family was.
And after all, she just naturally didn't fit into our group.
She wore all the wrong clothes, said all the wrong things.
Business-wise, she was an anchor around his neck.
You know, so many of our friends seem to be trapped by that sort of woman, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.
Oh, Sampan, would you like anything more?
No, thank you.
To tell you the truth, I've had just about enough.
Shall we take our after-dinner drinks over here?
- A delicious dinner, Mr. Sommers.
- Well, I'm delighted.
Thank you.
I warned you, honey, but you insisted on coming.
- Really outdid herself, didn't she?
- I'll get our coats.
What are you talking about?
You can't do that.
We haven't talked to Sommers yet.
If you wanna talk to Sommers, talk to him yourself.
You're the one with the inside track.
- Come on, hon.
- Darrin, I'm not going to run.
Darrin, if you and Larry want to talk to Daddy, now's the time.
I'll take care of Samsara.
- Samantha.
- Why not call me Sam.
It might be easier to remember.
Get a grip on yourself.
Will you let go of me?
Sorry.
Come on.
Gentlemen, sit down.
Cigarette?
- No, thank you, Mr. Sommers.
- No, thanks.
Now, for heaven's sake let's stop talking about people Stan doesn't know.
Poor dear.
I don't know if you're aware of it but Darrin here has had extensive experience with your type of product.
He did a topnotch job for us on Webbley Foods.
I understand they're leaving you.
Oh, no, quite the reverse.
Listen, gang I met the most divine white hunter from Rhodesia at Monte's party and he offered to take a group of us on safari this summer.
So if any of you wanna go, you let me know.
Perhaps you and Darrin might like to join us.
Well, I'm afraid we're pretty well occupied for the summer.
Tell us what you're going to do.
Something wildly exciting, I suppose.
Oh, very.
We're going to install new plumbing in the house.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
Congratulations, my dear.
You know, you have managed to turn our carefree, impulsive Darrin into a real homebody.
Incidentally, did you hear that the club is going to open up new memberships?
No.
They wouldn't dare.
Well, they have to raise the money somehow.
Before you know it, they'll be letting anyone into the club.
And if they do, I'm going to resign.
I mean, what is the point of a club if it isn't going be exclusive?
There's so little breeding in the world today.
Is that a fly or a bee?
I think it's a fly, miss.
- No, no, it's a bee.
- A bee?
Well, get it off of me.
- Just hold it, miss.
- Oh, Charles, what are you doing?
I think I got it.
Charles, you clumsy fool!
Leave me alone!
Not now, Gaylord.
Go away!
All right, now, Gaylord.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Shoo!
Daddy!
Daddy.
These petit fours are delicious.
I must ask Sheila where she got them.
Yes?
Send her in, please.
- Hi there.
- Hi, honey.
Get your errands done?
- I'll be with you in a minute, - Oh, good.
I'm starving.
Oh, sweetheart, I am sorry about last night.
Sheila deserved it.
Even if it did mean blowing the Sommers account.
I can't figure out what happened to that material for Webbley Foods.
Couldn't find it at home, I can't find it here.
Hi, Sam.
You sly little fox.
Pulled a fast one, didn't you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
He doesn't know what I'm talking about.
Isn't he something?
You know what you are?
You're irascible.
- I am?
What did I do?
- What did he do?
You old conniver.
You decided not to take any chances and you sent your ideas over to Webbley Foods anyway.
And are you ready?
They loved them.
We're renewed.
But I didn't Sam, what did you do this morning?
I told you.
I had some errands to run.
I cannot tell you how happy I am about Webbley Foods.
Do you know I had dinner alone three nights in a row because of them?
I'm happy that it wasn't for nothing.
Enjoy your lunch.
You son of a gun.
- You know what you are?
- What?
Irascible.
But lovable.
- What does "irascible" mean?
- I don't know.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Mother?
Mother, I know you're here somewhere.
What are you up to?
Good morning, dear.
Where is my darling little Tabatha?
You know, she simply adores her grandmama.
Well, I don't.
Mother, I am furious with you.
Oh, what on earth for?
Where is the little angel?
She is out playing in the yard.
Now, don't you be devious.
I know you put a spell on Darrin.
It was just a harmless little touch of revenge.
I would hardly call burying Darrin under a ton of shaving cream a harmless little touch of revenge.
He looked like a walking snowman.
Wasn't it amusing?
Darrin is not laughing.
Well, he deserved it.
He behaved very churlishly towards me last night just because I brought Tabatha a little gift.
A unicorn is not a little gift.
You know I meant well.
Besides, Tabatha would have been the only little girl on the block with a unicorn.
Mother, you have a depraved sense of humour.
- Thank you.
- Sam, I'm leaving.
Why don't you just take a few minutes and have some breakfast?
- I'm late already thanks to your mother's weird sense of humour.
Darrin, maybe you're wrong to blame Mother.
I mean, they could've all been just accidents.
The shaving cream could've been overheated and you just could've squeezed the toothpaste too hard.
And that chicken could've been waiting for a bus.
Do me a favour, will you?
Tell that old bat to get off my back.
Sam, I can't take any more.
She'd better quit or I'm going to do something desperate.
Mother?
Hey, Mom.
What is it, lambykins?
I heard the door slam.
Is Durwood having one of his temper tantrums again?
No, no.
It's more like a nervous breakdown.
He called me an old bat.
Now, that's not very nice.
Mother, he had every right.
You've been mean and spiteful.
Indeed.
And he's acting like a child.
As a matter of fact maybe he ought to look like one.
Sam?
Sam.
Oh, Mother, you put him back in his own car this minute.
Oh, all right.
You're just lucky I'm late.
Mother, I think you're being childish.
Now, these little tricks are unworthy of you.
Really?
Wait till you hear what's in his attaché case.
- What?
- A cobra.
- What?
- Defanged, of course.
Just for the shock value.
Mother, I want you to call off this vendetta right now.
Promise me.
I promise.
Witch's honour.
Witch's honour.
I promise not to bother dum-dum anymore.
Good.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some housework to do.
If you'll excuse me, I'd rather not watch.
Good.
Samantha?
Samantha!
What are you doing home so early?
It's only 10:30.
Why don't you ask your mother?
Mother?
What did she do?
I'll tell you what she did.
She lost us one of the biggest new accounts we've had in years.
Prune Valley Retirement Village.
Prune Valley?
Right.
I walked into the conference room.
I stood at the head of the table.
I greeted Mr. Leroy Wendell, the client, and his associates.
I opened my briefcase and nine people fainted, including me.
Oh, my goodness.
Well, what did Larry say?
Just two words, "You're fired".
Oh, Darrin, Mother promised she wouldn't.
Well, I've got news for you.
When it comes to your mother's promises, there's a big credibility gap!
Darrin, you're shouting at me.
Why shouldn't I be shouting at you?
Because you shouldn't take my mother's lack of credibility out on me.
Why not?
You two hang together, don't you?
"Hang together"?
Just what do you mean by that?
Well, you know what I mean.
When we get down to the nitty-gritty, we know where your sympathies lie.
- Broomsticks are thicker than water.
- Darrin!
It's been that way since we got married.
You and her against me, and I'm the one who suffers.
You know what I think you've got?
A persecution complex.
Well, who has a better right?
Maybe you'd be happier if you'd never met me.
- Is that what you're trying to say?
- You said it, I didn't.
What do you mean by that?
Make of it anything you want.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin?
Where are you?
What's happening?
Morning, darling.
What did you do with Darrin?
I was just being a good mother-in-law, I gave him what he wanted.
- What?
- He said he'd be happier if he'd never met you.
He didn't say it.
I said it.
Who cares who said it?
I arranged it.
- Where is he?
- Right where he would be if he'd never met you.
Mother, you bring him back right this instant.
Now, just wait a minute.
Let's not be hasty.
He may be a good deal happier where he is now.
- He loves me, Mother.
- Are you sure?
After all we've put him through these past few years.
Let me refresh your memory.
How many normal red-blooded American husbands have been changed into a monkey and a penguin and a wart hog.
Darrin was never a wart hog.
You're quite right.
It's just that I thought about it so much.
Mother, do you know what all this proves?
It proves that he loves me.
What man would go through all this if he didn't?
Now, you bring him back.
You want what's best for him, don't you?
I'm what's best for him.
Do you have the courage to find out if that's really so?
We can very easily, you know.
We can just go and take a little look.
All right.
Let's just do that.
But I know you're wrong.
Good.
Let's go.
Where are we going, Mother?
We're crossing time, Samantha.
To the now that might have been if you and Durwood had never met.
Here we are.
Don't be nervous, dear.
I'm not nervous.
Oh, really?
- Morning, Mr. Stephens.
- Morning, Joey, baby.
Bring her up around 3:00.
L I wanna take a run out to the boat.
Right.
There.
You see, Mother, how miserable he is?
Miserable?
He doesn't look miserable to me.
Well, it's obvious.
Those clothes, and that car.
And a boat.
Well, it's simply a cover-up for a very lonely man.
What about that big smile?
It was a lonely smile, Mother.
All right.
Let's go upstairs and take a look at him in the office, shall we?
Oh, my.
What's he done to his office?
Why?
I think it's very elegant.
Yes, but that's the point.
It's too elegant.
It's overdone.
Oh, really?
Well, I'll say one thing.
Not knowing you hasn't hurt his golf game any.
Look at all these beautiful cups he's won.
Oh, sure.
Wasting his time on a golf course.
Lonely man.
I don't know.
Have you seen these pictures?
Acapulco, San Juan, Buenos Aires.
Running away from life.
Yes, and he's still wearing that same lonely smile in all those pictures.
I wonder how he's doing in business.
With all his playing around and golf and everything he couldn't be doing too well.
Darrin?
Quiet.
Watch me sink this.
Good shot.
Listen, congratulations, you son of a gun.
We just signed up Jonathan Broadhurst.
You know, those layouts of yours flipped him.
Couldn't wait to put his name on the paper.
Of course, Lar.
It was in the bag.
You know, I was talking to McMann yesterday and it looks like we might have to change a few signs around here.
How does McMann, Tate and Stephens sound?
Well, not as good as Stephens, Tate and McMann, but I guess it's okay.
He's going to be a partner.
- Isn't that wonderful?
- No.
- Darrin?
- Hey, Sheila, come on in.
Mother, that's Sheila Sommers, Darrin's old girlfriend.
Hello, Larry.
She doesn't look so old to me.
Well, I'll see you kids later, huh?
I've got some things to do.
He's kissing her, that dirty cheat.
He's not a cheat, Samantha.
After all, he's not married to you.
Oh, that's right.
Oh, he's a regular little kissing bug, isn't he?
You know something, Darrin?
I don't think I can wait 10 more days until I'm Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
They're not married yet, Mother.
We could go to Vegas.
If we catch a plane now, we could be married today.
How romantic.
Elope?
Oh, now, Darrin, we couldn't do that to Daddy.
You know, he's already spent so much on the wedding.
And he's invited all his business associates and it's gonna be a big tax write-off.
Daddy's all heart, isn't he?
Oh, Darrin about the honeymoon after Lisbon, we ought to skip Majorca and go to the Canary Islands.
We could spend three or four weeks there.
He only took me to Atlantic City.
I hate to bring this up, but how much is this trip going to cost?
Now, Darrin, you promised you weren't going to talk about money.
Daddy's taking care of the whole thing.
It's his wedding present.
I know, but I just don't feel right.
He still doesn't know a good thing when he sees it.
Oh, darling, I've got to be going.
But don't you be late for that party tonight, huh?
Wonder how she'd look with that putter wrapped around her neck.
Samantha, we're here just as observers, you know.
You wear your white dinner jacket with your ruffled shirt.
You look beautiful in it.
Ruffles?
Darrin?
- Okay to come in?
- Oh, come on in.
- Sheila just left.
- You know, I envy you.
Marrying a gorgeous girl like Sheila whose daddy's the fourth richest man in the country.
You gotta be the luckiest guy alive.
I guess I am.
I guess I am the luckiest man alive.
Come on.
I'll buy you a drink on it.
Now, are you convinced that Durwood is happier without you?
You heard it from his own lips.
Darrin didn't say "happy," Mother.
He said "lucky".
There's a big difference.
Oh, come now, Samantha.
The best way is a clean break.
No.
No, I wanna be sure.
I'm gonna go to that party tonight.
Oh, you are a glutton for punishment.
Darrin, at this moment I feel very warm towards you, like a father.
- Oh, what did you have in mind?
- My money.
That's not true, Sheila.
That $28 and a half million your father has never entered my mind.
Entered my dreams a lot but never my mind.
I'll tell you one thing, Darrin is not marrying me for my money.
As a matter of fact, I had to propose.
Oh, Mother, she's dreadful.
How can Darrin stand her?
Oh, I think they make a lovely couple.
Friends.
Friends, could I say something?
Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to offer a toast to my daughter, Sheila and my future son-in-law, Darrin Stephens.
A long and happy marriage.
And it better be long and happy because this whole thing is costing me a fortune, huh?
What's so funny about that?
Now, in addition to picking up the tab for the honeymoon l'm also going to give the happy couple two oil wells in Texas a corner lot in the heart of downtown Phoenix plus a complete set of lightweight airplane luggage.
I wonder what the losers get.
Well, he's not the Darrin I know.
It looks like rain, Samantha.
We have a long ways to go.
Here he comes.
Oh, Mother, look at him.
I wonder what he's thinking.
What do you think he's thinking about?
Power, money, success, income tax.
Wonder where he's going.
Well, what's the difference?
We've seen enough.
No.
No, I'm going to follow him.
Samantha.
Why doesn't that girl ever listen to her mother?
- All right?
- It's all right.
Well, look who's here.
The bridegroom himself.
- Hi.
- Hi, Mr. Stephens.
- Hi, Dave.
- Darrin, what are you doing here?
I came in for a drink.
What else?
A last drink with your old buddies before you take the fatal step, huh?
You're right.
I'll have a bourbon on the rocks.
Make it a double.
Sure thing.
Dave, can I talk to you seriously for a minute?
Of course.
If you can't talk to your best friend, who can you talk to?
I'm happy for you, Darrin.
I'm very happy for you.
Oh, thanks, Al.
You know Sheila's a wonderful girl make a wonderful wife.
Two people.
Takes two people to make a marriage.
And love.
Love, that's the glue that binds.
She's got a lot to offer a guy.
Her father does too.
Twenty-eight and a half million dollars.
Give a little, take a little.
That's what makes a marriage.
Tell you the truth, I'm not sure I love her.
The main thing is mutual understanding and trust.
But how would I know what love is?
I mean, maybe I'm in love with her, and I just don't know it.
But why wouldn't I know it?
I'm very happy for you, Darrin.
Very happy.
You found the greatest treasure of them all.
Hey, I gotta go.
Al, on the tab, huh?
And, Darrin, if you wanna ever have another little serious talk you just call me, huh?
Thanks, Dave.
I don't know, Al.
Maybe I'm expecting too much.
Maybe I'm looking for magic.
Well, I'd better get going.
On the house.
A little wedding present.
Thanks, Al.
Thank you.
I am sorry.
That was clumsy of me.
Oh, not at all.
It was my fault.
- I wasn't looking where I was going.
- No, it was my fault.
Are you meeting someone?
Well, I'm not sure.
I may be too late.
May I buy you a drink while you wait?
All right.
Thank you.
What will you have?
Martini, please.
Al, a martini for the lady.
Well, I'm sorry I can't join you, but I have to get back to a party.
But it was nice bumping into you.
Well, so long.
Put that on my tab, will you, Al?
That was very rude of me and not to mention stupid.
This might be my last chance to buy a drink for a beautiful girl.
Yes, I'm getting married in a few days.
Really?
You must be thrilled.
Yeah, I should be, shouldn't I?
Aren't you?
Oh, you wouldn't be interested.
Yes, I would.
I really would.
You would?
Say, haven't I seen you somewhere before?
No, I don't think so.
It's funny.
You're sure we've never met?
I'm quite sure.
You mean you're not excited about getting married?
Oh, I didn't say that.
Sheila's a great girl.
I mean, we've been going together for a long time, and Yes?
Well, I'm just wondering if maybe there's a reason I've been holding off.
Maybe I've been looking for something else.
Do you know what I mean?
Yes, I know exactly what you mean.
So do I. For the very first time, so do I. This may sound kind of crazy but will you do me a favour?
- What?
Will you sit right here and wait for me?
I'm I have to go, but I'll be back.
I have something very important to do.
To undo.
- Well, I don't - Please.
Al, don't let her out of your sight.
Please.
Don't go away.
He isn't happier without me.
Mother.
- Mother?
- I heard the whole thing.
It was sickening.
Bring him back, Mother.
Oh, it kills me to think you're going back to this miserable bourgeoisie existence.
Bring him back.
All right, but I'm not going to stay around to see it.
I mean it, Sam.
There are times I wish I never met you.
Of course, there are other times I realize that I couldn't live without you, and I have to admit that's most of the time.
Oh, Darrin.
Even if I lose my job at McMann & Tate I still have you and Tabatha.
That's all that matters.
And there's that too.
Hey, listen to this, honey.
"Own your own business.
Sell our screen doors direct to the public".
How do you like that?
I can be a door-to-door door salesman.
Darrin, don't be ridiculous.
Larry's not gonna fire you just because of one little client.
It wasn't one little client.
It was one big client.
Larry wanted that account, and I blew it.
Oh, I'll get it.
- Oh, hi, Larry.
- Hello, Sam.
Is Darrin here?
I gotta talk to him.
Larry, I know why you're here, and I've only got one thing to say.
Do you own a screen door?
Boy, I've gotta hand it to you.
What perception.
What instinct.
Sam, this husband of yours is something.
His tactics are a little strange, but he's something.
You had Wendell figured all the way.
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, what do you mean?
Well, didn't you hear the news?
It was on the radio and TV.
Leroy Wendell was indicted in Minnesota on a phony real estate scheme.
Well, how do you like that?
Sure, but you sized him up right away, didn't you, you snake in the grass?
He really fouled up the meeting.
Sent Wendell screaming out of the office.
See, honey, I told you it would work.
One question, though.
Why didn't you let me in on it?
I knew you'd never go for it, Larry.
You know, you're right.
Sam, this husband of yours has the guts of a riverboat gambler.
Yes, I know.
Well, I've gotta run.
I'm late for dinner, but I just had to stop by and tell you in person, you son of a gun.
- Bye, Sam.
- Good night, Larry.
So long, Larry.
There.
You see how nicely everything turned out?
And we owe it all to Mother.
You had to say it, huh?
Well, it's true.
Well, let that be our secret.
I wanna tell you how sorry I am that I got sore this morning and said all those things to you.
I can't imagine what life would be like if I hadn't met you.
I think I'd be pretty darn miserable.
Well, that's something we'll never know, will we?
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Oh, my stars.
"The Purple Panthers, a motorcycle gang invaded a peaceful love-in last night at Union Park causing a riot.
- When the police arrived" - Coffee ready?
All poured.
- I'll get the toast.
- Just coffee this morning, honey.
I can't figure this one out.
- What, dear?
- It's supposed to be a picture of some trouble at a love-in.
Well, maybe it was out of sight.
May I have my paper, please?
Oh, never mind.
I'm late anyhow.
- Bye, hon.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Bye.
Was this trip necessary?
Yes.
And it's just a local stop on your way back to your freak-out in Soho.
Sam, why are you bugging me?
I was having a perfectly groovy time in jail.
I know.
I was leading my cellmates in a love chant.
Serena, I read all about your escapades in the paper.
And if it hadn't been for a little artful dodging, Darrin would have too.
- So?
- Well It's just that Darrin's a little old-fashioned about some things.
But, Sammy, I'm preaching one of the most old-fashioned things around.
Love, love, love.
Hi.
Hi, Auntie Serena.
Tabatha, sweetie.
Sammy, she misses me.
Auntie Serena play music?
Of course Auntie Serena will play for you.
Not now, Serena.
Why don't you come back a little later say, about 10 years later?
It's a good thing I know you're kidding.
Come on, Tabatha.
Auntie Serena will teach you a little "Rock-a-Bye Baby" to a rock-'n'-roll beat.
Louise?
How long is it since you've seen Samantha?
Oh, gosh, about a month.
In fact, I was thinking of calling to find out what she's been up to.
I think I can tell you.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
- I can't believe it.
- Well, neither can I. - That can't be Samantha.
- No?
Then who is it?
You will never convince me that one of my best friends if not my very best friend has suddenly become a hippie.
- Not so suddenly.
You said you hadn't seen her for a month.
A person can't change their entire character in a month.
Really?
You changed yours in a day.
- What?
- The day we got married.
Do you have any idea what this kind of publicity could cost McMann & Tate?
Larry, it's all right if you make a fool of yourself in front of me.
I married you, for better or for worse.
But promise me you won't say a word to Darrin.
Are you kidding?
Give me credit for a little sense.
- Good morning.
- Morning.
- How's Samantha?
- Fine.
Good.
It's been so long since Louise and I have seen you and Sam I wondered if you'd like to get together for a little bridge tonight.
At your place.
You're invited.
Fine.
Now, can we discuss the Giddings Tractor account?
- Tomorrow.
- But Giddings is coming in tomorrow.
I wanna know if I'm handling his account.
I said, tomorrow.
Now, let's not talk business during office hours.
Bye-bye.
See you tonight.
- Why did he have to pick tonight?
- I don't know.
He kind of invited himself.
I didn't know how to get out of it.
Well, sweetheart, I love having them.
It's just that Well, tonight's a little awkward.
Why?
Did you ask someone else?
Cute, huh?
Serena!
You called, O square one?
What are you doing here?
- She was singing Tabatha a lullaby.
- That's a lullaby?
!
Number one on the charts.
Where you been?
I'll tell you where.
I've been under the impression it was clear you're not welcome in this house.
- Watch it, sweetheart.
- No, I'll handle this.
As far as Tabatha's concerned, I forbid you to sing your so-called lullaby.
- Cousin-in-law when you use words like "forbid" to me, smile.
I was perfectly happy cooling it in the cooler till Sam zapped me out.
You were what?
It isn't important, sweetheart.
Don't put me down, coz.
It was important enough for my picture to be on the front page of the paper.
Now I get it.
"Riot at love-in".
You zapped her picture out of the paper this morning.
Well, I didn't want you to worry, sweetheart.
And that explains Larry.
He must've seen that picture too.
He thought it was you.
No wonder he kept asking, "How's Samantha"?
And that kook laughs.
- What did you call me?
- Kook!
Sammy, does Tabatha like artichokes?
- Now, Serena - Tell him he's going too far, Sammy.
Darrin, you're going too far.
I'll go even farther by suggesting that you go a little farther.
Like back where you flew from.
- Someday you'll say you're sorry.
- Oh, Serena, he didn't mean it.
Oh, Darrin, I wish you hadn't done that.
It worked, didn't it?
She's gone.
But not for long.
- Hi, Louise, Larry.
- Hi, Samantha.
Hi.
Well, come on in.
It's been too long.
Darrin's helping me fix some snacks.
We'll only be a moment.
- Let me have your coats.
- Thank you.
Fix yourselves a drink.
See how wrong you were, Larry?
- You were wrong.
Admit it.
- Okay, I was wrong.
But you'll have to admit, whoever it was sure looked like Samantha.
Where have we seen that before?
Like in this morning's paper?
Sweetheart, there are mornings when you don't get to read the paper.
This could've been one of those for Larry.
So why bring it up if it isn't necessary?
Why?
Well, what of it?
Lots of people have guitars.
Not many guitars have all that psychotic paint on them.
That's "psychedelic".
Put it down.
Sam, Darrin, I was just wondering Before we start, why not watch our Springer Pet Food commercial?
- It's on just after the news.
- Good idea.
Fine.
You don't have your drinks.
I'll get them.
How about the boys playing the girls tonight, huh?
And for our final human predicament we switch our scene to the county jail where the elite of hippie society is now in residence.
Hippies and the police have had an active relationship in the past but nothing quite as active as today when the high priestess of the movement did a vanishing act from the jail cell that would have baffled Hou The darndest thing.
Samantha's cousin Serena turned hippie.
Oh, her cousin, eh?
- We do look very much alike.
- Do you?
Deal.
Right.
Five-card stud.
Jacks or better to open.
- Darrin, we're playing bridge.
- Oh, right.
They just look alike.
They always have looked alike.
They always will.
It's one of Mother Nature's nasty tricks.
But Sam is Sam and Serena is Serena.
And Sam couldn't be Serena if she tried, and vice versa.
- I'd like to believe you, Darrin.
- Why would I lie to you?
If Louise turned hippie, I'd lie to you.
And I'd understand.
But in this case, it just doesn't happen to be true.
Scout's honour?
That's a load off my mind.
And to show you what kind of a sport I am for making a mistake I accept your apology if you'll accept mine.
Okay, joke's over.
Mr. Giddings will be here any minute.
Every man in the office wants this account.
But you're gonna get it.
You know why?
- Why?
- Because you speak his language.
Language?
I hope he isn't Italian.
I've been through that.
He's early American.
All the old-fashioned virtues.
Man of the soil, all that nonsense.
It's probably him.
Yes?
Mr. Giddings is waiting in your office, Mr. Tate.
Thank you.
I'll go get him, set him up then it's your bale of hay.
So start pitching.
Darrin, say howdy to Mr. Giddings.
Darrin Stephens.
- Howdy, sir.
- Howdy.
- Won't you sit down, sir?
- Thank you.
Tate here tells me that you were brought up on a farm.
- That's right, sir.
- Good.
- Family man, I suppose.
- Indeed he is.
Darrin's married to a fine, young early-American-type lady.
Bakes her own bread right in the old stone hearth.
Home-baked bread?
Well, Mr. Stephens, you're a very lucky man.
- Yes?
- Mr. Stephens your wife is here to join you for lunch.
My wife?
I didn't have a date with Samantha.
Just tell her to run along.
Since when does a wife have to make a date with her husband?
I'd be mighty pleased to have her go along.
Send her in.
Home-baked bread, huh?
Hi, sugar.
Pops.
This is a girl who bakes her own bread?
Oh, now, cut that out.
- Mr. Giddings, Larry, this is - Have you flipped?
Since when do you have to introduce me to snow-white and handsome?
Stop it, Sam.
This is Mr. Giddings of Giddings Tractor.
Giddings Tractor and his Psychedelic Six.
Man, I play your records all the time.
Tate, is she out of her mind?
Compliments will get you everywhere, you old charmer.
Please, Serena.
This is no place for games.
You're making a fool of yourself.
He's blown his cool.
Always does when he's hungry.
Hey, listen, I know a groovy little beanery called the Double Bubble.
Cut it out, Sam.
A joke's a joke.
She's not Sam.
She's Serena.
Mr. Giddings, what do you think of a man who denies knowing his own wife?
Well, under certain circumstances, young lady, I can understand it.
Why are you doing it, Sam?
Man, that straight life can be a drag.
A girl's got to have her kicks.
Oh, for heaven sakes.
Mr. Giddings, I'm sorry.
There's been some terrible misunderstanding.
Come on.
We'll go into my office - You - I told you, baby.
When you put the knock on love, you asked for a mess of trouble.
Well, you're Where is she?
Where is she?
- Sam, where are you?
- Sam?
Serena.
She's gone.
She left.
- I didn't see her go.
- She must've gone through the Why ask for answers at a time like this?
No, you're right.
Giddings is out there trembling with rage.
Now tell me, how are we gonna explain Sam to him?
How?
How?
- Larry, listen - I'm listening, I'm listening.
It's simple.
We tell him the truth.
That that was Serena, Sam's kooky cousin and she has a very weird sense of humour.
I didn't get to be head of an advertising agency without stretching the truth now and then.
I might honestly say that I'm one of the best truth-stretchers in the business.
But don't ask me to try to sell a cockamamie story like that.
Larry, that girl that was in here was Serena Remember, you're talking to your best friend.
Sam is in bad shape.
Louise's cousin is a psychoanalyst.
Now, just let me give him a call.
Guess there's no sense in trying to explain it to you, is there?
You just won't give up, will you?
- Larry, I'm sorry we lost the account - The account?
Who cares about the account?
It's you I care about.
You and that poor little girl who used to be Samantha.
- Larry - Darrin why didn't you confide in your old Uncle Lar?
Don't you know that Louise and I are behind you 100 percent?
- Swell.
Then come to dinner tonight.
- Dinner?
I'll have Samantha and Serena together Darrin, will you please stop this charade?
Humour me just one more time.
Please?
Please?
Of course.
You poor kid.
Serena.
Serena will you come here?
I know you can hear me.
- It's no use.
- Sam, what am I going to do?
I promised Larry Serena.
I warned you.
She can be a stubborn girl.
Honey, I had no choice.
Larry was driving me crazy.
- I have it.
- What?
If the real thing won't come along, I can always do this.
Serena.
Sam.
That's marvellous.
That is marvellous.
Except I can't be both of us at the same time.
Larry and Louise.
But, Sam, the table's set for five.
What happens when the four of us sit with the five of us?
I don't know.
I'm a witch, not a magician.
You go let them in.
- Yeah, I'll go let them in.
- Yes.
- Come on in, come on in.
- Hello, Darrin.
- Good evening.
- Hi, Louise, Larry.
- Let me take that, Louise.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
- Here you are.
- Larry.
All right.
Hi, beautiful people.
Hi.
You remember Louise Tate, don't you, Serena?
- Oh, yeah, sure.
Hi, Louise.
- Hi.
Congratulations, cotton-top.
You got a wild-looking chick there.
Serena, explain to Larry why you acted the way you did this afternoon.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you see, my headshrinker says that I have kind of a compulsion for practical joking.
I don't know when to stop.
But I'm working on it, baby.
And don't you worry about Mr. Biddings.
- Giddings.
- Sorry, bubee.
Why don't you invite him over and I'll explain the whole silly mess?
Your witness.
I'd like to put you across my knee and spank you.
But I'm so relieved that you're you and she's she, I could kiss you.
- Groovy.
- Where's Samantha?
She's upstairs, taking care of the little princess.
I'll go fetch her.
A remarkable resemblance.
Oh, I don't know.
I think Sam's eyes are set farther apart.
And I think her cheekbones are higher.
Hi, everybody.
- Much higher.
Hi, Samantha.
- Louise.
Where's your kooky cousin?
Oh, she's upstairs playing with Tabatha while I check my groovy.
Gravy.
I rest my case.
Well, I think I'll go upstairs and see Tabatha.
You can't.
She's sleeping.
No, she's not.
Samantha just said Serena's playing with her.
Oh, that's right, Serena's playing with her.
She's playing with her upstairs.
Oh, Larry, that Tabatha's getting prettier every day.
Thank you.
We're proud of her.
Thank you.
Well, I guess I ought to go in the kitchen and help Samantha.
Oh, wait a minute, Lulu.
Don't walk out on the entertainment.
Sit down, everybody.
Make yourselves comfortable.
Larry, Louise.
I know a little ditty recorded by the Belters on the flip side of America the Beautiful.
It's called "The lffin' Song".
Well, gang, I think I'll go put on a new face before dinner.
Pardon, cotton-top.
Be right back.
She's a real swinger, isn't she?
There's something very strange going on in this house.
Yes, isn't she?
"Lffin'".
She She.
Sam, where are you?
Okay, what now?
Well, now we'll just sit down and have dinner.
Have dinner with who?
There are five place settings.
Doesn't it seem odd Sam and Serena are never in the room at the same time?
- Larry, you don't think - The only question is how does she get in and out of her clothes so quickly?
Larry, your suspicions are becoming an obsession.
I don't know how she does it, but you watch: Either Sam or Serena's going to come down with a bad headache.
But only one of them will sit down to dinner.
You watch.
It's no use, honey.
We'll just have to tell them that That That what?
That Serena came down with a fearful headache.
That Serena came down with a fearful headache.
I hope they believe it.
Oh, Serena, am I ever sorry I started with you.
Come on.
Larry, Louise, it's time to sit down for dinner.
Larry here.
Louise here.
Where's Serena?
I'm glad you asked that.
You see, Serena Serena's headache is all gone.
I really feel simply marvellous.
Sugar, that's all I wanted to hear you say that you were sorry.
I am, I am.
And I'll never, ever, ever do it again.
What did you do?
Now, Larry, every family is entitled to its own little secrets.
Well, I'm so glad we could all get together.
Oh, there, you see?
Love power conquers all.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
"And then Prince Charming bent over Sleeping Beauty and kissed her.
Her eyes fluttered and opened.
There was joy and wonder in them as she beheld the prince.
'Oh, Prince Charming,' she sighed.
'I've waited so long for you.
' Soon after, their marriage was celebrated throughout the kingdom and they lived happily ever after".
And then what?
- That's all.
- No, read more.
Well, there's no more to read, sweetheart.
They got married, and that was the end.
The end of the story, I mean.
And you stop stalling, young lady.
Lie down.
Shut your eyes and go to sleep.
Shut.
Surprise.
Mother, I wish you wouldn't do that.
Not that I mind, but you know how Darrin objects.
I also know that he's gone out of town on business.
And I've come to help you celebrate.
I thought a nice weekend on the Riviera.
You, Tabatha and me.
We would also have to include Louise and Larry Tate and Darrin's cousin Helen and her boyfriend.
They're coming for dinner.
- Oh, how revolting.
- So it's been nice seeing you, Mother.
You're going to throw me out?
I'd be delighted if you'd stay.
But they'll be here any minute so would you mind changing?
- Of course not.
Oh, lovely.
- Thank you, darling.
- Oh, that is lovely.
Book.
And then what happened?
You won't mind bartending, will you, Larry?
In Darrin's absence, it's the least I can do.
Especially since you are responsible for his absence.
If I didn't know you better, Sam, I'd think you were kidding.
Larry says we've met Helen.
I don't recall her.
You met her.
She's the one that brought that baseball player to our Christmas party a few years ago.
The one with the great strikeout record.
I thought he was a catcher.
I'm talking about Helen.
Well, the truth is, she hasn't been very lucky with men, poor girl.
I think she's hoping to impress this latest candidate with the joys of married life.
Remember that.
Don't worry.
Fortunately, I've had quite a bit of acting experience.
- Samantha.
- Yes?
Endora.
How are you?
Could you excuse yourself a moment, Samantha?
Well, Helen and her friend will be here any second.
Just the same, I think you'd better tear yourself away.
Excuse me.
Her mother visits her a lot, doesn't she?
Yes, but at least she waits until her son-in-law's out of town.
- Hi, Helen.
- Hi.
- Remember me?
Larry Tate?
- Of course.
Samantha'll be down in a moment.
This is Ralph.
Nice to meet you, Ralph.
Come in.
And this is my wife, Louise.
- Hi.
Hello there.
Won't you sit down?
- Hi.
Oh, Mother, you have to do something.
I can't have him roaming around here with a house full of company.
There's nothing I can do, Samantha.
For some reason, Tabatha can't seem to work the spell in reverse.
Tabatha, how often have I warned you about this sort of thing?
Please, do not blame the dear child.
She was merely curious.
And she's so lovely, so like her mother in beauty and grace.
Personally, I think the child is remarkably advanced.
And I'm not saying that because I'm prejudiced.
You should be very proud of your niece.
Granddaughter.
No.
Impossible.
The story doesn't mention where you're from, Prince Charming.
But there must have been a lot of oil on the property.
For the time being, would you please step in here?
Of course, dear lady.
That is not going to help, Samantha.
Why?
That's why.
Samantha, he has no substance.
Have you forgotten?
He's a product of witchcraft.
- Oh, no.
Mother, what am I going to do?
- I hope you won't think me forward.
But it would give me great pleasure to join your company.
It's so dull being confined to the pages of a book.
Always the same old faces.
Yes.
Nothing against you, but Yes?
Couldn't I see the baby before she goes to sleep?
Just a moment.
I hope you don't mind.
Dear lady, to make you happy is the object of my existence.
Come in.
I hope you don't mind, but I haven't seen the baby since Mother, Mother, this is Darrin's cousin, Helen.
- Hi.
- Helen, this is my cousin, Charlie.
How do you do?
It's a great pleasure to meet you, dear lady.
Oh, my.
I just know I'm blushing.
Do you mind if I say that the bloom of your cheek rivals the rosy dawn?
Oh, no.
Go ahead and say it.
Helen, did you wanna say good night to Tabatha?
Who?
Oh, of course.
- Hi.
- My, how she's grown.
Helen, I really think we should go down and join the others.
I just love the English, especially English men.
Mother, haven't you any suggestions at all?
- Just one.
- What's that?
Set another place for dinner.
Guess who dropped by unexpectedly?
My cousin, Charlie.
This is Louise Tate.
Charmed.
Samantha, where have you been hiding him?
This is Larry Tate.
- A great honour, sir.
- Hi.
And you must be Ralph.
My mother.
- How do you do?
- And cousin Charlie.
- A great pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.
Well, dinner won't be too long.
Please sit down.
- Larry, would you freshen this drink?
- Yes.
Well Oh, dear ladies, as I cannot divide myself suppose I give you instead my undivided attention?
Oh, what a marvellous sense of humour.
You're very kind, but a sense of humour is useless until it falls on a receptive ear.
I can't get over the feeling that I've seen you before.
How happy that makes me.
For is not familiarity the doorstep to friendship?
- What'd he say?
- You got me.
I have to do something to divert Helen's attention from the prince.
Well, I'd suggest an earthquake, but I doubt if it would work.
- I think I'll try some nice loud music.
- Yes.
Oh, good.
I was just in the mood for dancing.
I thought Larry didn't like to dance.
He doesn't.
Oh, that one's perfect.
Oh, Charlie.
You're making a fool of yourself.
- Jealous?
- Of him?
You could learn a couple of things from him.
What?
How to smile and say nothing?
It would be an improvement.
Can I get you another drink?
Thanks.
Could you make that a double?
Can I ask you something?
Is that guy for real?
Oh, what a marvellous dancer you are.
And may I say that you, dear lady, dance as if the air were your home.
- What do you mean?
- He talks and he talks but he doesn't say anything.
Well, for your information, he won't be staying long.
That makes two of us.
You know, you're just too good to be true.
Oh, look, a full moon.
Let's dance out there.
She may have problems, but being shy isn't one of them.
If she isn't careful, she's gonna be shy one man.
Excuse me.
Where's Ralph?
I'd better find him and talk to him.
He might be a little upset.
Too late.
And he was.
- What do you mean?
- He just left.
Oh, no.
You're a regular David Niven.
- Helen.
- Yes?
I think you should know, Ralph just left.
Ralph who?
Well, it's wonderful to hear your voice, Darrin.
Oh, everything's just fine.
Cousin Helen?
Oh, she had a wonderful time last night.
You're coming home when?
Late tonight?
Well, if I sound funny, it's just because I miss you.
Me too.
Bye.
- Did you hear that?
- I did, and I thought it was revolting.
Mother, he is coming home tonight.
You've done nothing about getting the prince in the book.
Well, please don't get overwrought.
And above all, don't lose your sense of humour.
There's a funny side to everything.
Oh, really?
Can you see the look on Darrin's face if he comes home and the prince is still here?
See?
There is a funny side.
Hi, Sam.
Sorry to bust in on you so early, but Oh, good morning, Endora.
But I just had to speak to you before I went to the office.
- About what?
- Your cousin Charlie.
I tell you, I couldn't sleep a wink last night.
Oh, Larry.
Well, you don't think Louise was seriously interested in him?
No, but she was pretty darned intrigued, wouldn't you say?
Well, maybe.
But I don't think you have to worry about Louise.
Well, who's worried about her?
You're not?
Then what kept you up?
Well, that's what I wanna talk to you about.
Can we go into the den?
Excuse us.
- Helen.
- Hi.
I hope you don't mind my dropping in so early in the morning.
- But I think I left my gloves here.
- You weren't wearing gloves.
No wonder I didn't have them when I got home.
Well, as long as I'm here, do you mind if I stay to have a cup of Charlie?
I mean, coffee?
You don't understand these things.
Take it from me this cousin of yours is dynamite.
I won't deny he's got something.
But how can you and Darrin use it?
One of our big problem clients, and Darrin's the account executive is Abigail Adams Cosmetics.
Know how many guys they turned down to do their commercials?
You don't mean you're gonna recommend him to do their commercials.
No, I'm going to recommend him to work in the mailroom.
- That would be better, Larry.
- Sam, come on, get with it.
We've got hold of a guy who's dynamite with women.
Yes, it's certainly worth thinking about.
Why don't you wait and discuss it with Darrin when he gets back tomorrow?
Tomorrow?
Sam, I'm so sure of this, I've set up a camera audition for 11:00 this morning.
This morning?
Today, this morning?
The client will meet us at the studio.
With his wife, at my suggestion.
Tell Charlie to grab his coat and come on.
Now, wait a minute, Larry.
I mean, don't you think you ought to find out if Charlie's interested?
I thought you said he was between jobs.
- Well - You realize what kind of income these commercials bring?
Now, come on, let's stop wasting time.
- Would you like some coffee?
- Thanks, but no time for that now.
- Where's Charlie?
- Out on the patio with Helen.
Excuse me.
What's going on?
I just love a man who loves children.
I think it's such an important quality in a husband Father Man.
There you are.
Good morning.
Charlie, may I tell you what a lucky man you are?
They're going to put him in front of a camera?
Yes.
That should be delicious.
I'd love to be there when it happens or rather when it doesn't happen.
- What do you mean?
- But a prince can't appear on the telly.
He has no substance.
Oh, Mother, this is no time for character analysis.
Samantha, I've never known you to be so dense.
Haven't I already told you that the prince is only a projection that he is a creature of witchcraft?
You put him in front of a camera, and there won't be an image.
Well, then he won't get the job and You mean the screen will be blank?
Exactly.
Larry!
Isn't it exciting about Charlie?
Where is he?
Did he go upstairs?
Did Larry go with him?
He went with him, but they're not upstairs.
- Where are they?
- On the way to the TV studio.
- Oh, no.
Mother.
- What?
Mother, will you please watch Tabatha.
I have to go after them.
Could I possibly drive down with you?
I'm not driving.
I've got to fly.
Fly?
I don't very often go out on a limb, but I can practically guarantee this fella will put Abigail Adams Cosmetics in the number-one spot.
- Believe me, Mr. Blumberg.
- Well, I'm willing to be shown.
But I wish you'd brought your wife along.
She'd prove my point.
But I did bring her.
As far as I'm concerned, I think you'll be perfect for the job.
If I can merely approach your expectations it will be my special joy, dear lady.
In fact, I think you'll be more than perfect.
See what I mean?
Why don't you go get your wife and let's go into the booth?
I'd have waited for you if I'd known you wanted to come along.
Well, it isn't that I wanted to They haven't started yet, have they?
Just about to.
What is it, Sam?
You seem a little upset.
Who, me?
No, no.
I'm perfectly relaxed and calm.
Larry, you have to call off this audition.
Well, why?
Now, look, it's something about Charlie.
Don't ask me what it is.
But if you put him before a camera, you're gonna be very embarrassed.
And this is very confidential.
What is?
What I just told you.
What did you tell me?
- Okay, Al, put him in the chair.
- Right.
I want to wish you all the luck.
Since I've met you, fortune has already smiled.
If you ask me, he's some kind of nut.
You should be such a nut.
What's happening?
Why isn't he in the chair?
- He is.
- I mean the black leather one.
That's the one he's in.
- What do you think?
- Of what?
How does he look to you?
Frankly, I don't know what they see in him.
Me neither.
How you doing?
We're having strabismus trouble, Mr. Tate.
I'm afraid we'll have to postpone the audition.
Mother.
Oh, there you are.
- How did it go, darling?
- Fortunately, it didn't.
They thought their equipment was wrong.
What a shame.
It would have made a delightful conversation piece.
Yes, and when Darrin found out about it, he would've had a fit.
As I say, what a shame.
Have you made any progress with Tabatha?
Who had a chance?
Elena hasn't left me alone for a moment.
- It's Helen.
- Well, whatever her name is she certainly knows how to keep a conversation ho-humming.
Is she upstairs?
Well, I'll get rid of her.
We have to get the prince back before Darrin gets home.
Please, I beg of you, don't send me back.
Sorry, Charlie, I don't have any choice.
You'll be much happier there.
No, I won't.
I like it here.
Everyone's so kind.
Especially the ladies.
I don't want to go back.
Well, for your information, you don't have any choice either.
Samantha, I hate to say you're wrong, but you're wrong.
- Pardon?
- I realize what the problem's been all along.
It isn't that Tabatha's not performing the spell properly.
But it can't work if he doesn't want to go back.
Mother, I hope this isn't another one of your questionable jokes.
If I'm not telling the truth, may I never enjoy another glass of wolfbane on the rocks.
Well, what about Sleeping Beauty?
- Who?
- Now who's joking?
No.
No, I don't think he is.
I'll be back in a minute.
Gad, you're beautiful.
If only you were a little more inhuman.
I'll go right down.
Would you mind if I call my mother in Buffalo and reverse the charges?
I really ought to tell her about Charlie.
Helen, why don't you wait till later?
You mean when the rates change?
Well, when something changes.
Do you have any objections to a big wedding?
Mother, would you and Charlie come up here for a minute?
Very well.
Mind if I borrow him for just a little bit?
Oh, no.
- Will you see who that is, please?
- Oh, of course.
- How did you know I was here?
- They told me at the hotel.
I just wanted to Anyway, I'm sorry I left last night without saying anything.
- Well, that's okay.
- No, it's not.
I shouldn't have left without saying you're one of the rudest girls I ever met.
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
Well, that's the way I feel.
I'm just glad I found out in time.
Look, if the only reason What do you mean, "found out in time"?
You think I wanna marry somebody that runs after every pretty face she sees?
Marry?
Ralph, dear, don't stand out there.
You'll catch your death of cold.
It's who?
Sleeping Beauty, who else?
You see, Tabatha zapped him out of the middle of the book.
He didn't know about the end of the story.
See what you get if you go back?
Well, go ahead.
You still wanna stay here?
As you people say, "Are you kidding"?
In that case.
All right, sweetheart.
Very good.
And they lived happily ever after.
Right.
Now it's my turn.
Now, remember, Tabatha, under no circumstances whatsoever are you to do that again.
Do you understand?
- Do you understand?
- Yes, Mommy.
Well, it could've been worse.
Suppose you'd been reading her one of the Babar books?
Well, at least Helen wouldn't have flipped over an elephant.
Which reminds me.
How am I gonna tell her about Charlie?
My suggestion is straight shock treatment.
- Behave yourself.
- Yes, Mommy.
Helen.
- Helen?
- Yes.
Charlie is gone, Helen, and he's not coming back.
Charlie who?
I've got something to tell you too.
Guess who's getting married?
Us.
Would you say she's rather fickle?
Maybe so.
But I'm sure she'll never forget cousin what's-his-name.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- Hello.
- Hi, honey.
Bad news.
I have a lot of changes to make in the presentation so I have to work tonight.
Oh, sweetheart, that's a shame.
Shall I keep dinner warm?
No, thanks.
I'll probably work past midnight.
I sent out for a sandwich.
I'm sorry about dinner tonight.
Well, that's all right.
It'll be just that much more fun tomorrow night.
- It's a deal.
Anything new there?
- You'll be happy to know we got a postcard from your folks.
It says, " Having a très gay time.
Wish you were ici".
It's from Paris, and it's dated last week.
Oh, good.
Well, I'd better get back to work.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.
- All right, sweetheart.
Bye-bye.
Good evening, Samantha.
Aunt Clara.
What were you doing in the refrigerator?
I just came back from England.
I came back via the polar route.
- Polar route?
- I hope I haven't crushed your lettuce.
My goodness.
Be careful, dear.
Yes.
I'm still a bit chilled.
Yes.
Well, here, sit down.
Sit down.
Aunt Clara, dear, don't you think it would've been safer if you'd used the front door?
No, that would be like giving up the ghost.
Ghost?
Oh, my.
Ghost.
- What ghost?
- McTavish.
The one I wanted you to get rid of.
Aunt Clara, I'm afraid I'm not following this at all.
Why don't we have a cup of coffee and you can explain the whole thing from the beginning, all right?
- Ghost, huh?
- Yes.
And a very disagreeable one at that.
Now, wait, let me see if I've got this straight.
Your old boyfriend, Ockie, has just acquired a castle in England and now he calls himself Lord Ockham, Duke of Dunstable.
Doesn't that sound genteel?
Yes, very.
Anyway, he calls it Dunstable-on-Tyne.
And last night he opened it as a tourist hotel but that dreadful McTavish He's the castle ghost.
And the guests are frightened to death.
Oh, Samantha, it's just not funny.
Well, Aunt Clara, I don't see how I can help you.
Witches don't have any power over ghosts.
Yes, I know, but I thought if you talked to him you being queen and all, maybe the prestige of the crown You don't think so, huh?
You know I can't go hopping over to England.
Darrin doesn't approve of these things.
By the way, where is Darrin?
- He's working tonight.
- Oh, that's too bad, dear.
I'd keep you company if I didn't have to get back and give Ockie the bad news.
Aunt Clara, you're still here.
Well, I am the dumb witch.
Would you like me to help?
Oh, Samantha, if you would.
And it wouldn't take long.
Only a half an hour or so.
Aunt Clara, for a dumb witch you're pretty tricky.
No, I'm not pretty.
Okay, Aunt Clara, I'll try and help.
Under the circumstances, I don't think Darrin will mind.
Oh, that's marvellous.
And Ockie will be so pleased.
Okay.
I'd better get going.
Now, you'll have to stay with Tabatha till I get back.
Aunt Clara, wish me luck.
Good luck.
It seems so easy when she does it.
McTavish.
McTavish, old bean, I want a word with you.
- Lord Ockham, I presume.
- You needn't startle a chap like that.
Oh, Samantha, tallyho, old girl.
Delighted you could come.
Where's the ghost?
I expected to find the place in an uproar.
It has been off and on.
You see, the place is so big, they can't pin him down.
He appears in one place, scares one of the guests half to death then disappears before I can get there.
Why don't you just pop in when he does?
Tried it once.
Ended up in the moat.
There he is again.
McTavish!
Will you kindly materialize?
There's someone here wants to talk with you.
Say something, Samantha.
Mr. McTavish?
You'll never catch Mc Tavish, you cursed intruders!
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's a pushy ghost.
Samantha!
Samantha!
I told Larry the presentation would just have to wait.
Darrin, what are you doing here?
- Aunt Clara, what are you doing here?
- I asked you first.
Oh, well, I decided that Sam was such a good sport about my working late at the office that I Where?
Where is Samantha?
She didn't expect you until later, so she went.
Went?
Went where?
To England, of course.
- England?
- Yes, that's right.
How did you know?
What is she doing in England?
She's helping Ockie to get rid of McTavish.
- Who's McTavish?
- The ghost, of course.
Aunt Clara, I want you to listen carefully.
You're to find Sam and tell her to come home immediately.
Understand?
I don't think I can get there from here, without Samantha's help.
She's there, and I'm here, and, well I think we'll just have to wait until she gets back.
McTavish.
Well, you heard it yourself, Frank.
Something is laughing and clanking out here.
Oh, Phyllis, for heaven's sakes.
That stuff is all rigged for the tourists.
An English castle wouldn't be worth its salt without a ghost.
McTavish?
Frank.
Frank, come back here immediately.
Phyllis, is it asking too much for me to get some sleep?
Frank.
Frank, you're not going to believe this but I just saw Samantha right down there.
I know what I saw, Frank.
She was right there.
I ought to know my own daughter-in-law.
Phyllis, this is pretty close to being the silliest thing you have ever done.
Silly, is it?
I guess it isn't pretty silly that Lord Ockham told us the girl that I saw was the duchess of Stephens.
That's pretty logical.
Stephens is a fine old English name.
Yes, operator.
I'm waiting.
I don't think it's silly to want to know what she's doing in an English castle when she should be home taking care of my son.
Hello?
Hello, Darrin, it's Mother.
Hello, Mother.
Where are you calling from?
England?
Oh, that's marvellous.
I hope you're enjoying yourself.
Oh, we're fine, just fine.
Sam?
She's fine.
She's fine too.
Fine.
- Could I speak to her, dear?
- Well Give me that.
Hello, son.
Son, this is Dad.
Now, just forget that we called.
We're staying in this English castle that's supposed to be haunted and it's got your mother all upset.
She actually thought that she saw Samantha roaming around the halls.
- Isn't that ridiculous?
- Yes, that certainly is ridiculous.
Well, you tell Mom just to relax and have a good time.
You too, Dad.
Goodbye.
Aunt Clara, my folks are there.
You've got to get to Samantha.
I'm working on it.
I'm working on it.
He said that she is in bed asleep, and that's exactly where I'm going.
Now, if you want to stay up all night and worry, be my guest.
I could have sworn All right, Frank.
I'm coming.
Frank.
Frank, the suit of armour Frank!
Well, what do you know.
I made it.
Bingo.
Mr. McTavish.
Mr. McTavish?
Very impressive.
You're not terrified by my horrible visage?
I don't think it's so horrible.
Perhaps if I removed my head from my Gaelic shoulders.
You have very nice eyes.
You have no sense of the proper way to act around a ghost.
What manner of lassie are you?
My name is Samantha Stephens.
I'm a witch.
Oh, one of those.
Like that half-baked, puny excuse for an English laird, Lord Ockham.
If you don't like Ockie, why don't you leave?
Me leave?
Kevin McTavish, the fifth Earl of Angus that's lived in this castle for 500 years.
To please a weak-kneed warlock that sends a lassie to do his bidding?
Never.
Well, if you won't leave, will you at least stop scaring the guests?
That's what ghosts do, lassie, scare people.
What would you have me do at my age, learn a trade?
You do have a point there.
But I must say, if I were a ghost I'd find a much better place to haunt than this.
What's the matter with this place?
Well, for one thing, it's cold and drafty and damp.
You know, lassie, you may be a witch but you have an understanding heart.
Mr. McTavish, you seem like a sensible ghost.
Why let your pride stand in the way of finding a more comfortable place to haunt?
But where would I go?
You have the whole world to choose from.
Italy, France.
You could even come to America.
Find yourself a nice airy place with central heating and air-conditioning.
You have those things in America?
Sure, we do.
And America's a much younger country so we don't have as many ghosts.
Lassie, I've got to admit it.
You've made a deep impression on me.
Samantha?
Samantha, are you in there?
Did you hear that?
He's calling Samantha.
Well, there's more than one Samantha in the world, Phyllis.
We'll soon see.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for someone.
Wait, madam.
You can't go in there.
I'm sorry, Lord Ockham, but once she gets an idea in her head just relax, let her have her way.
- You think it over, because - Samantha.
Don't you ever knock before entering a room?
Your Majesty.
Hi.
I guess Aunt Clara explained what happened.
- Where is Aunt Clara?
- She's out looking for you.
Oh, dear.
She did explain that it was an emergency, didn't she?
Sure.
- Then you're not angry with me?
- Angry?
Of course, it's gonna be a little difficult explaining to my mother.
Now, sweetheart, she only saw me for a second.
And the room was very dark.
She couldn't possibly have been sure it was me.
And that makes everything all right.
- Then you aren't angry?
- How could I be angry?
I don't understand.
If I had any vision, I would realize that you can't take a proud bird born to ride the wings of the wind, to live in the sparkle of a star and pen it up in a domestic coop and expect it to walk around with a smile on its beak.
- Darrin, have you been drinking?
- Everything is very clear.
- Your mother's been right all along.
- You have been drinking.
Just enough to realize you can't snatch an eagle out of the sky and tie it to the ground - Darrin.
Darrin.
Darrin, I am sorry about what happened tonight.
I thought you'd be working late, and I planned to be home before you got home.
And anyway, I really thought you'd understand and I was gonna tell you about it anyway.
The fact remains that normal housewives do not go to England to get rid of ghosts just because their husbands have to work late.
Are those for me?
Yes.
Sweetheart, I said I'm sorry.
Now, what more do you want me to say?
Say, "I love you".
I love you.
McTavish, what are you doing here?
I decided to take you up on your offer.
I've had a look around and I think I shall be very happy here.
Well No buts.
He's gotta be out of here by the time I get home tonight.
All right, sweetheart.
But every time I try and talk to him he goes on about how much he appreciates my inviting him here and what a nice house this is to haunt.
You have till sundown.
I'm sure I can convince him it was all a mistake.
Mistake?
He's a catastrophe.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll work it out.
I hope.
- Yes?
- Mr. Stephens Mrs. Stephens is on the phone.
- Thank you.
Sam, is he gone?
Mother?
Mother, isn't it awfully expensive to keep calling from England?
We're not in England, dear.
We're at the airport.
- We took a direct flight.
- At the airport?
We'll explain everything when we see you.
We're taking a cab to your house.
I'm so anxious to see Samantha.
- No, Mother, don't do that.
- Why not, dear?
Isn't Samantha there?
Sure, of course, she's there.
We just want to see you all at home.
Bye.
He's protecting her.
Let's go.
- Hello?
- Sam, we have an emergency.
- My folks are on the way there.
- Your folks are in England.
Not anymore.
My mother won't be satisfied until she sees you at home.
Well, then what's the problem?
I'm here.
So is that ghost.
Now get rid of him!
Darrin, ghosts are very stubborn.
Couldn't you ward them off until?
Maybe that's him now.
See you later.
See you later.
Mr. McTavish?
Mr. McTavish, is that you?
Ockie, for heaven's sake.
This'll teach me to use Clara's directions.
- What are you doing here?
- We've had an emergency.
I've been completely wrong about McTavish.
The guests love him.
They expect an English castle to have a ghost.
He's turned out to be the main attraction.
I've gotta get him back.
Well, you can whistle for me, you puny lairdship.
I've got a new home now, right, lassie?
McTavish, please come back.
I apologize for all the things I said about you.
Not on your life, laddie.
I'm well rid of you.
Looks like a buyer's market, McTavish.
It wouldn't hurt to dicker a little.
Hey, you're a clever lass.
Why should I leave a cosy wee place like this that has central heating?
- I'll put in central heating.
- Aye, for the winters.
But what about the summer?
The humidity's terrible for my rheumatism.
I'll air-condition the place.
Hurry up, Frank, tell him to keep the change.
You'll have to get rid of the moat, breeds mosquitoes.
How can I get rid of the moat?
You're supposed to be a warlock, aren't you?
Use an incantation!
I'm afraid that's beyond me.
I'm semi-retired.
Then so am I. Right here.
Samantha, please, you've got to make him come back.
We need him.
Frank.
Frank, that's Lord Ockham's voice.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
All right, McTavish.
I'll get rid of the moat for you.
Agreed?
- Agreed.
- Now you'll both have to go.
Samantha?
Why, Mrs. Stephens, come in.
Mr. Stephens.
- Hello.
- What are you doing here?
Darrin said you phoned last night from England.
Who else is here?
I distinctly heard voices.
Voices?
It must have been the television set.
I was watching an old movie while I cleaned the house.
I tell you, Sam, we just gotta get him back.
He was the best sheriff this town ever had.
You know, for a second, Phyllis, you almost had me believing you.
Could I fix you some tea, Mrs. Stephens?
Thank you, Samantha.
I think I'm having another one of my sick headaches.
I tell you, son, your mother got so carried away with this ghost business.
You know, they get it all up for the tourists.
It gives them a good scare, and they love it.
But your mom got so confused she actually thought that she saw Samantha there.
Made me take the first flight home to prove it to me.
Isn't it amazing what a vivid imagination can do?
But I understand it.
There have been times when ghosts had me pretty scared too.
Well, I must admit I feel pretty foolish.
Don't worry about it, Mom.
We're glad to see you anyway.
Wonder who that can be.
Excuse me.
I took your advice, dear, and came in the conventional way.
Aunt Clara, what a surprise.
Come right in.
Look who's here, Darrin.
Aunt Clara, you remember Darrin's parents?
- Oh, of course, of course.
- Hello.
- Nice to see you again.
- Thank you.
Samantha, dear, I have a present for you from an old admirer.
And he says, "Thanks for getting rid of the moat".
What a strange reaction.
I think he's rather handsome.
Well
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Sweetheart, I'm starting the pancakes.
Be right there.
Tabatha, I hate to smother another creative urge, young lady but oatmeal is for eating not for finger painting.
Just a minute.
Could you wait a minute, please?
Someone's at the door.
We're going to Dr. McDonald's.
And he's gonna weigh you, so put some of that food inside.
Gas company.
I'm just gonna check the meter out here.
- Oh, fine.
- Always inform people of my presence.
- Don't wanna be taken for a prowler.
- That's a good idea.
If I'm gonna get shot, I want it to be for a good reason.
Yes.
Would you excuse me?
I have someone on the phone.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Can you hang on for just a moment, please?
Eat.
- Who was that on the phone?
- I don't know yet.
Would you like your lawn mowed?
Well Darrin, there's a boy here.
- Do you want the lawn mowed?
- I'm very cheap.
Tell him no thanks.
It has to be reseeded.
I can reseed it if you tell me how.
If I knew how, I'd do it myself.
Got something burning?
The pancakes!
Sam!
What was that with the pancakes?
Why Oh, Darrin, I simply have to answer that phone.
Hello.
I'm sorry to have kept you waiting.
Is this what?
The Institute for Domestic Harmony?
Boy, have you got a wrong number.
Sam, millions of wives all over the country manage to cope with pancakes in the normal way.
Why can't you?
I told you.
I didn't want them to burn.
I see.
You wanted me to burn instead.
All right.
All right.
Next time I won't answer the phone.
And anyone who comes to the door can go hang.
You've always got some excuse, haven't you?
I have to get Tabatha ready to go to the doctor.
Now, I said I'm sorry.
What more can I do?
You can live up to your promise.
- I try.
- Not hard enough.
Darrin, why don't you go to work?
I'll go when I'm good and ready.
Which, fortunately for both of us, is right now.
Okay.
Now, remember, when we get to Dr. McDonald's office it's one balloon and one lollipop, okay?
Two balloons and two lollipops.
How about no balloons and no lollipops?
One balloon and one lollipop.
Thought there was supposed to be somebody home.
- Search me.
- You sure this is the right place?
One-six-two.
One-six-two.
Well, let's get started.
They'll probably show up before we leave.
I told you to go at the doctor's.
I don't get it.
They were supposed to be here hours ago.
- I hope they got lost.
- Are you gonna start that again?
Sue me.
I like real grass.
I'm telling you this stuff looks real.
It even feels real.
You don't have to water it, weed it or mow it.
I happen to like the way grass smells when it's freshly mowed.
Well, you wouldn't if you had to mow it.
Hi, Mr. Stephens.
That's a groovy-looking lawn you got there.
Thanks.
It is?
Wait till Daddy hears what a good report we got from the doctor.
He's going to be very proud of his little girl.
Big girl.
Yeah, that's right.
You did grow three-eighths of an inch.
Now, here, take one sip for Mommy.
And one sip for Daddy.
Oh, Sam.
I know that tone.
Better make it two sips for Daddy.
You're home early, sweetheart.
Sam, if you're looking for an argument, I'm too tired.
- Pardon?
- I'll admit I went a little bit overboard about pancakes this morning.
But that's still no reason to rub my nose in it.
- In the pancakes?
- No, in your witchcraft.
I'm even willing to believe that you were trying to save me some money.
But I would like it clearly understood that either I can afford something or I can't.
If I can't, I can't.
Well, that certainly makes sense.
But nothing else you're saying does.
What on earth are you talking about?
That.
- Where did that come from?
- Sam, please.
Cut it out.
You mean you think I did this?
No, I think thousands of elves arrived each with a blade of grass, and planted it.
- Very funny.
- Well, this isn't.
Darrin, I had nothing to do with it.
Then who did?
This isn't even real grass.
That only proves that even a witch isn't perfect.
One of us has to be big about this.
I'll admit I was hard on you this morning if you'll admit you were trying to get back at me by zapping in that lawn.
Pass the lamb chops, please.
Afraid I'll get sore?
I promise I won't.
The lamb chops, please.
You're entitled to an emotional upset just like any other woman in the world.
Another act of defiance, huh?
Why couldn't you just ask me to pass it?
What's the difference?
I might as well be hung for a lamb chop as a lawn.
Sam, believe me, you'll sleep much better if you'll just admit it once and for all.
Darrin I would like to make a statement.
You mean you're ready to tell the truth?
- Yes.
- Well, I'm listening.
The truth is I am up to here with that stupid grass.
I would like desperately not to hear another word about it.
And I would like to go to sleep.
I see.
Okay, I won't say anything more.
- Thank you.
- Except for this.
Even if you won't admit it, I forgive you.
That's very generous.
If it's all the same to you, I do not want to be forgiven for something I didn't do.
And I am going to bed.
Will you take care of one thing first?
Get rid of it.
All right.
Thunder, dunder Seven-day wonder Look below and see this blunder Spirits all who roam the night Tak e this greenery from my sight See?
Don't you feel better now that you've admitted it?
Sorehead.
Thanks.
Hate to bother you so early, but what happened to it?
I What?
Our grass.
Grass?
Who - Who are you?
- Well that's who we are.
Artificial grass?
Like he never heard of it.
That turf we laid down yesterday is worth 2000 bucks.
- What'd you do with it?
- Well, let me Who told you to put it?
Why did you deliver it here?
Because you've got the wrong number on your house is why.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes, indeedy.
Well, naturally you're surprised.
Frankly, so am I. You see, I thought that my wife put that That is, when we realized it was a mistake my wife took it away.
Your wife?
Your wife picked up 1500 square feet of grass?
Well, not her personally.
Naturally, she had help.
You don't care about that.
You just want your grass back, right?
- That's right.
- I'll see that you get your grass back.
You know something, you're not making much sense.
Oh, he is to me.
He's got it stashed somewhere, and he's gonna sell it.
That's ridiculous.
You check with me later, and I'll give you further details.
Who was that at the door?
Wrong number.
- What?
- I mean, wrong address.
Sam, I've been thinking.
Last night I jumped to a conclusion.
I was wrong.
I'm sorry.
Who was at the door?
Just a couple of men looking for Sam, the truth is, that grass was put in by mistake.
It's worth $2000, and I'm responsible for it.
- I see.
- Sam, they're coming back.
They expect to find that grass.
You realize, of course, that I'll have to use witchcraft to get it back.
Of course.
And suddenly that doesn't bother you?
Sure it does, but what else can I do?
I don't know.
Why can't you cope with the situation like any other mortal husband?
Your average mortal husband doesn't have a wife who can remove the lawn.
And she doesn't have a husband who is inconsistent.
This is no time to start an argument.
I see.
When would be the best time?
Are you going to cooperate or not?
I haven't made up my mind.
The other alternative is to pay the $2000 and you cut down on your household expenses.
I just made up my mind.
Oh, Sam.
Oh, thank you.
And I'll make it up to you.
I promise.
I'll even be nice to your mother.
I may get ill, but I'll do it.
You can begin by not insulting her.
I didn't insult the old warhorse.
It's okay.
Go on, go on.
Hallow, fallow, rooster's cry As the sun climbs in the sky Spirit of light, bring back the lawn That these mortal fools did spawn What?
What's wrong?
I don't know.
Are you sure you've got the right spell?
Positive.
Someone must be counteracting it.
But who?
"Let the dumb cluck bail himself out".
Signed, The Old Warhorse.
Oh, Darrin.
Well, that's the last time I try to be nice to her.
The way I got rid of those guys was by telling them l'd check with my wife.
What do I tell them next?
My wife's checking with her mother?
Sweetheart, I'm sorry, but you shouldn't have offended her.
If she doesn't take off that counterspell, I can't do anything about the lawn.
You see who it is.
I'll keep trying to contact Mother.
My name's MacLane.
I live up the street.
- Oh, and my name's Darrin - I know, I know.
What'd you do with my grass?
- You're the one who - Yeah.
They told me they installed it here by mistake.
And why have you got my numbers on your house?
Oh, well, they're not the same.
It's loose.
See?
- Funny coincidence, isn't it?
- Not to me, it isn't.
Where'd it go?
The whole thing's a mystery to me, the whole thing.
But you're welcome to look around.
I'm sure I don't have it.
But the company told me they delivered it here.
Wait a minute.
Before you make allegations you better see a lawyer, and furthermore Hey, Mr. Stephens, what happened to that beautiful lawn you had yesterday?
Oh, you better tell me what happened to my lawn, buddy.
Now, wait.
Don't do anything that you'll regret later on.
These things are never solved by physical force.
I warn you, I fought as a middleweight in the Navy.
And I make it a rule never to fight out of my class.
Good grief.
You have to change your rule because I'm gonna bust you right in the bazoo.
Just you wait.
I'm not only gonna get you for theft l'm going to sue you for assault and battery.
Sweetheart, you all right?
Yes, and thanks, Sam.
You're a great referee.
Any luck with your mother?
Oh, she's just being obstinate.
What are we gonna do?
I was thinking about that between punches.
We've got to try something drastic.
Come on.
Darrin, I'm not sure this makes sense.
Why not?
Your mother's counterspell only applies to our lawn.
It won't stop you from putting that grass where it was supposed to go in the first place.
But how are you going to explain how it got there?
That's the best part.
I won't.
That big ox will.
Okay.
Let her rip.
Hallow, fallow, rooster's cry As the sun climbs in the sky And the spirits of the day are seen Change this lawn to verdant green You see?
It worked, it worked!
I'm off the hook.
- Pretty good job, huh?
- It's beautiful.
- This artificial grass is great.
- Maybe we should get some for our lawn.
- Sam.
Well, I meant the regular way.
You know, if I didn't know it was artificial I would be willing to bet Sam, it is real grass.
What?
Oh, my goodness.
Maybe you used the wrong spell.
Or maybe I can't produce artificial grass, only the real thing.
What kind of sense does that make?
Quick, before somebody Elvira, we've got our lawn.
Come here, quick.
Elvira, where are you?
I'm coming, I'm coming.
When did they put it in?
It must've been while we were arguing.
How about that.
Is that terrific?
I told you before, and I'll tell you again.
I like real grass.
Are you gonna tell me that doesn't look real?
Not to me, it doesn't.
It even feels real.
Is that clever?
They have crabgrass in it to make it look more realistic.
It even smells like real grass.
Here, look at it.
Feel it.
It's your grass.
You feel it.
Boy, are you stubborn.
While they're inside, make artificial grass.
- I'm not sure I can.
- Try.
- Well, all right.
Let me think a minute.
- We may not have a minute.
I think I've got it.
I hope.
Philisin, Follisin, spirits that fly Let me give it another try Replace this velvety carpet of green With artificial grass of waxen sheen Nothing happened.
Well, it's a little hard to tell.
For your information, this is genuine artificial grass.
Honey, that's great.
I knew you could do it.
- Now, let's get out of here before - Elvira.
Come out here and really look at it this time.
This is better than the samples they showed me.
Bend down and feel it.
- Well?
- This feels like real grass?
- You won't admit it, huh?
- I'll only admit one thing.
You've been drinking too much beer.
Stubborn, that's what you are.
Stubborn.
- I think we started a family feud.
- Sweetheart, I have news for you.
That feud started the day they got married.
Did I ever tell you you're not only talented, but lovable.
Darrin, please, there's a robin watching us.
So what?
Let him get his own girl.
- Darrin, this is silly.
- No, it isn't.
It's the least I can do to make up for yesterday.
Well, okay.
I think I'll pour the coffee while I'm waiting for the pancakes.
No, you don't.
Not in my restaurant.
I'll get it.
Darrin.
He's in a very generous mood this morning.
Sweetheart, guess who's back.
Oh, hi there.
I noticed your lawn didn't look any better than yesterday.
Don't you want me to reseed it?
Okay, pal.
You got a deal.
Gee, thanks a lot.
I'll do a real good job.
I got this book on how to do it.
See?
I see.
Well, I'll start right after school.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
- Cute.
- So are you.
That was very sweet.
Well, what's the sense of kidding?
I'm a sweetheart sweetheart.
Now, Darrin.
Darrin, you'd better stop.
You'll be late for - The pancakes!
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are they ruined?
- I'll take a look.
How do you feel about charcoal-broiled pancakes?
Sweetheart, why don't you sit down and let me make breakfast.
Okay, okay.
Thank you, Sam, for letting them burn.
Don't you worry, sweetheart.
I've learned my lesson.
I love you.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
- Sam?
- Yes, sweetheart.
Please hurry, will you, honey?
This client doesn't fool around.
- I wanna be on time.
- I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.
- You almost ready?
- Almost, sweetheart.
Are you kidding?
You're closer to going to sleep than you are to being ready.
Oh, Darrin, when a man lets his wife know at the last minute they're going to a party for a business associate that man has no right to be annoyed.
Let's not discuss the rights of man.
Let's just step on it.
On an hour's notice, I had to contact Mother to babysit.
She was late, I had to feed Tabatha, I had to press my dress and set my hair.
At least you didn't have to tote that barge and lift that bale.
So count your blessings.
I'm gonna pull the car out.
Don't strain yourself.
So much for the second floor.
Would you like a cosy attic or a sun deck?
A sun deck.
That's the way I would've designed it.
You have superb taste.
Now, come on.
May I talk to the architect for a moment?
How many times do I have to tell you no you-know-what in front of Tabatha?
If you're going to ask me to babysit at the last minute it's going to be on my terms.
Oh, no it won't.
You know perfectly well that you-know-what is forbidden around here, and as head of this household I absolutely will not tolerate it.
- Tyrant.
- Witch.
Oh, my brush.
Where did I put my brush?
Sam, please, we're late.
- How long have you been there?
- Long enough.
I don't know why I bothered pulling the car out.
Why don't we use your broom?
Darrin.
Everybody driving on this road tonight managed to get here without witchcraft.
I know that, Darrin.
Everybody at the dinner tonight managed to dress without witchcraft.
That's true.
And all we poor mortals manage to get through every day of our lives without witchcraft.
- I know.
I know, but - No buts.
When we got married, you promised to love, honour and no witchcraft.
Well, I knew you didn't wanna be late and so I just speeded things up a little.
- I was hurrying for you.
- For me?
Well, from now on, kindly remember I don't need you to use your witchcraft I don't want you to use witchcraft under any circumstances.
I don't want you Flat tire.
Must've picked up a nail.
Guess so.
Good thing I wasn't going fast.
Well, I'd better go out and fix it.
Fine.
Boy, it sure is raining out there.
Pouring.
I sure would love to know how I'm gonna change that tire in this rain.
Any suggestions?
Just like everybody else with a jack.
That's cute, honey.
You know this is what I would call a very unusual emergency.
And under the circumstances, I wouldn't object to you using a little No.
Oh, no.
No, no.
You were right.
Everybody manages to get through every day of his life without witchcraft.
- Well, that's true.
- And everybody on this road tonight got here without witchcraft.
- That's right.
- And everybody who gets a flat tire on this road tonight is going to change it without witchcraft.
So far be it from me under any circumstances Okay, okay.
Forget it.
I'll do it myself.
Thank you.
No, thanks.
I'm fine.
Tate, I'm leaving my old advertising agency for only one reason.
- You know what that is?
- No, but I'd love to.
Too much talk, not enough action.
Good reason.
I couldn't think of a better one.
I hear Stephens gives you as much action as you get in the business.
- Oh, he does.
He does.
Then, where is he?
He's a half-hour late and I'm starving.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
Hi, Larry, Louise, Mr. And Mrs. Sharpe.
Darrin, what are you doing in a wet tuxedo?
- Freezing.
- You see, we had this flat tire Well, that's the sort of thing that can't be helped.
Oh, it could've been helped, all right.
Dwight, Mr. Stephens can't just stand around like that.
No, he can't.
He's dripping all over our rug.
Come on, Stephens.
Let's see if we can't find you some clothes to change into.
And there I stood, looking like Smokey the Bear.
Oh, that's very amusing, Mr. Sharpe.
Then I remember Gwen and I went fishing on Lake Athabasca up in Canada.
Beautiful spot.
Very romantic.
Dwight, I was never on Lake Athabasca in my life.
What's keeping your husband?
I laid out a complete change for him.
Well, he's usually a very fast dresser.
- Perhaps I should go up and - Why go up?
Here I am.
I'm glad I'm not as tall as you.
I'd look ridiculous in my clothes.
Sam, maybe we'd better make it another night.
Nonsense.
If you go home now, you'll miss the rest of Dwight's story.
- What story?
- The one about the trip to Lake Athabasca that I didn't go on.
Darrin, I never noticed before, but you've got a great pair of legs there.
Stephens, where's your sense of humour?
I left it out in the rain.
A laughingstock.
An absolute laughingstock.
This evening was a fiasco.
Well, calling Mr. Sharpe "Shorty" didn't help.
He deserved it.
Well, of course he did.
If he'd had the good sense to be a few inches taller, none of this ever would've happened.
That's right, make jokes.
Well, you do look funny in that little suit.
A tall man in a small suit is classically funny.
It's been funny for centuries.
And you ought to know.
Are you making allusions to my age?
If the allusion fits, wear it.
You are one step away from making Custer's Last Stand look like a love-in.
It's your fault.
If you'd fixed that tire in the first place Let's not go into that again.
Why not go into it again?
It's the root of the whole problem.
To twitch or not to twitch: That is the question Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous - That's right borrow from Shakespeare.
You probably knew him personally.
There you go again.
Hinting about my age.
Well, it just so happens that Shakespeare was more of a gentleman than you've been tonight.
For that matter, so was Blue Beard.
And just how well did you know Blue Beard?
Not as well as I knew Henry Vlll.
Sam?
- Sam, where are you?
- I'm in the closet.
Listen to me.
Don't do anything you may regret later on.
Sam, where do you think you're going?
- Bowling.
- That's not funny and you're not leaving this house.
Tabatha and I are going home to Mother.
Just where does a witch go when she goes home to Mother?
That's for me to know and you to find out.
Sam.
Sam, you're my wife and I demand that you appear before me!
Oh, Sam.
Sam?
Good morning, Betty.
Good morning, Mr. Stephens.
- Have there been any calls for me?
- No, there haven't.
You sure there hasn't been a call from my wife?
I'm sorry, Mr. Stephens, but nobody called.
It's only 9:30.
Right.
Oh, Darrin l'd like to see you for a moment.
These go right out, Betty.
Darrin, your behaviour last night was inexcusable.
Please, Larry, let's not go over that again.
Again?
This is the first chance I've had to mention it.
Dwight Sharpe had it coming.
Just because a man has it coming doesn't mean you give it to him.
Especially when a man has a $500,000 account.
Exactly.
Let's talk about something else.
I've got more important things on my mind.
Like what, a $600,000 account?
- Please.
- Fortunately for you I smooth-talked Sharpe out of it.
Well, thanks.
Thanks a lot.
What's the matter with you, Darrin?
Oh, nothing.
I'm just fine.
- Sam okay?
- Well, she's fine.
Something wrong?
What could be wrong?
Why, when I left, she She was playing hide-and-seek with the baby.
And when Sam hides, she doesn't fool around.
Look how well she sleeps up here.
It's this lovely smog-free air.
I suppose so.
Maybe I should've fixed that flat tire after all.
I think what you need, my darling, is to meet someone new.
Take your mind off dumb-dumb.
Mother, I hope you're joking.
Mr. Sharpe is here.
Well, send him in.
Why would he wanna see you?
- Good to see you, Dwight.
- Tate.
Darrin and I were talking about last night and Darrin feels he owes you a tremendous apology.
- He doesn't know what got into him - Tate, shut up.
Stephens, if there are any apologies to be made, I should make them.
As my wife pointed out repeatedly last night, I behaved like a fool.
Well, I must admit, I was a little bit of a fool myself.
Nonsense.
I baited you.
And I could've easily sidestepped you.
- Stephens.
- Darrin if Dwight wants to be the fool, let him.
Okay, you're right.
- You were wrong.
- Good.
With that settled, I suggest we take another crack at dinner.
Marvellous.
I'd love to.
- How about my place again?
- Perfect.
- Let's say tonight.
- Let's.
- Let's not.
- What do you mean, "Let's not"?
- I thought you accepted my apology.
- I did.
Can't we just let it go at that?
No, I would like to apologize to Mrs. Stephens too.
I'll call her and give her your message.
I'd prefer to apologize in person.
I'm afraid it won't be possible tonight.
- Of course it's possible.
- Larry, it isn't.
I mean, my wife is at her mother's, and Darrin, only two minutes ago, you told me Sam was at home.
Did I say home?
A person's entitled to change his mind, isn't he?
What's going on?
Are you coming to my place tonight or not?
We'll be there, Dwight.
You can count on that.
- Let's say 8:00.
- Eight o'clock it is.
- Terrific.
See you then.
- See you tonight.
Why did you do that, Larry?
I told you I can't make it.
Oh, yes, you can.
There's a $500,000 account at stake so believe me, you'll make it.
Now, get in touch with Sam and we'll meet you at the Sharpes' at 8, sharp.
Eight o'clock sharp at the Sharpes'.
Sam.
Sam.
The phone, Darrin.
Try using the phone.
Samantha.
Oh, Darrin.
Samantha.
You know, Mother, that fight we had became ridiculous.
We got to the point where we said things we didn't even mean.
Sam, wherever you are, I didn't mean when I said the whole thing was your fault.
I didn't mean it when I said he wasn't a gentleman.
I didn't mean it when I said you knew Blue Beard.
It's all my fault for not fixing that silly tire.
Sam, it was all my fault for not accepting you as the sweet, beautiful witch you are.
I was being wilful and stubborn and definitely out of line.
I apologize.
I love you.
Would you please come home?
Darrin.
- Sweetheart, it was so - I don't know how I could - What?
- Not so loud.
You'll wake Tabatha.
I just put her to sleep.
- Okay, you first.
- Okay, you first.
- Okay, me first.
- Yeah.
This whole thing was my fault.
It was my fault.
And if you're willing let's forget the whole thing, pretend that it never happened.
It's forgotten.
And then we'll go to a nice, quiet little French restaurant sip some champagne and celebrate.
Oh, that sounds wonderful.
I'll get it, sweetheart.
Darrin, just dropped by to make sure that you - Oh, hi, Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
Be seeing you later, Sam.
I'll be up in a minute, sweetheart.
What are you doing here?
I wanted to make sure you won't blow that party at the Sharpes' tonight.
I have no intention of having dinner with Mr. Sharpe.
Sam and I have plans.
I know you do, with Louise and me for dinner at the Sharpes'.
I know Sam's home so you have no excuse.
Tonight is business, big business.
I tell you, Samantha's not in the mood for business.
- Well, get her in the mood.
- It's not that simple.
There's trouble in paradise.
Mother.
Oh, Samantha, when are you going to wake up?
You know what you are to Dobbin?
- Darrin.
- A convenience, a business asset.
Or, as the mortals say, a meal ticket.
Mother, you have Darrin all wrong.
In fact, we're going to a French restaurant tonight to celebrate my homecoming and you are babysitting.
If you are right, I'm babysitting but if you're wrong you, Tabatha and I are cloud-sitting.
- Deal?
- Deal.
Good.
Listen to this.
You're a bright boy, Darrin.
You'll think of a way.
See you and Samantha at the Sharpes' tonight.
- Larry - Darrin two last words, be there.
You see Mother is always right.
Don't be too sure.
I'll see you on cloud eight.
Honey, why aren't you getting ready?
Ready?
For what?
For dinner.
Have you forgotten?
Not entirely.
What was it again exactly?
Well, there was you, and me, and And?
A bottle of champagne in a cosy French restaurant.
- Just the two of us?
- Just the two of us.
Oh, Darrin.
Oh, I love you.
Oh, just the two of us?
Just the two of us.
That's right, the same group: Us, the Sharpes and the Stephens.
Oh, are we going to play Insult the Guests again?
Louise, never mind the sarcasm.
Just hurry up.
Sweetheart, I have something to tell you.
You see, I made this dumb bet with Mother.
Honey, I don't wanna talk about your mother.
Well Honey, what did Larry want?
He doesn't come over unless there's a good reason.
And what did he mean when he said, "Be seeing you later, Sam"?
Honey, I don't wanna talk about Larry either.
This is our evening.
Well, sweetheart, I wouldn't wanna stand in the way of important business.
There is nothing more important than you.
Now, fix me a drink.
Yeah.
Larry, hurry and get to the phone Or you'll end up At the Sharpes' alone Boy, if there's one thing I can do, it's make a dry I think I'll call Darrin.
Larry, come fix this clasp for me.
It's broken.
Oceans are churning Deserts are barren Larry, won't you please Call Darrin If you'll just hold your wrist still - I think I'll call Darrin.
- No, you don't.
Just stop nagging those two.
And don't worry they'll be there tonight.
I think I'll wear something else.
Maybe I'm being a little too poetic.
Larry, pick up that phone.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
What a pleasant surprise.
Well, sure we'll be there.
Be where?
Right.
Eight o'clock.
Sharp at the Sharpes'.
Oh, yes, Larry, that's very funny.
Yeah.
Bye.
Larry called you about tonight?
Went right by me, huh?
Well, now, sweetheart, I'm very glad he called.
It's a wonderful opportunity to straighten this out with the Sharpes.
Honey, it's not up to you to straighten it out.
It was all my fault.
- No, it wasn't.
- Lf I hadn't have been such a - lf I had fixed that tire - lf I hadn't have rushed you - Cheers.
- Cheers.
The evening's going to be a tremendous success.
I can just feel it.
It certainly is starting out right.
At least we're not going to be late.
And it's beautiful out.
There's even a moon.
And good tires.
I had them checked on the way home from work.
You think of everything, don't you?
Almost everything.
- We're out of gas.
- Oh, Darrin.
And the last gas station was at least five miles back.
Not necessarily.
Sweetheart, look.
That's funny.
I never noticed that before.
Neither did I. Isn't it amazing how quickly they build things nowadays?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Stand still so I can button your dress.
- I want to wear blue jeans.
- Tomorrow.
Today you are wearing a very nice dress because we are going to have very nice company.
Grandma Stephens.
Grandma Endora too?
No, sweetheart, just Grandma Stephens.
And Tabatha I want you to remember that Grandma Stephens and Grandma Endora are two entirely different grandmas.
- You understand?
- With Grandma Endora, I have fun.
Well, you have fun with Grandma Stephens too.
Only in a different way.
Because we can't let Grandma Stephens know that you're a That you and I are That you and I and Grandma Endora are And that Daddy isn't.
Do you know what I mean?
- No.
- I didn't think so.
So stay close to Mommy, and we'll hope for the best.
Tabatha, did you leave your shoes downstairs again?
Then be a good girl and get them.
Tabatha!
That is not how good little girls get their shoes.
Sometimes I have the feeling you don't get my message.
The sheep and the lambs are in the meadow.
The little colt stays near his mother.
Oh, look at his long legs.
Isn't he cute?
Here she is.
Be sure and give her a big kiss.
Oh, Mother Stephens.
I can't tell you how delighted I am to see you.
The same to you, my dear.
And how is my son, your husband?
Handsome as ever and hard at work to support his family.
Hello, Grandma Stephens.
Well, sweetheart.
My, what a nice welcome.
Did you coach her?
Oh, Mother Stephens, what a thing to say.
Tabatha, my sweet, I have a little present for you.
Thank you.
- Bunny hop?
- No.
No, sweetheart, the bunny doesn't hop.
The bunny is a toy bunny.
Can I make this bunny my baby brother?
Yes, sweetheart, so long as you only pretend.
Okay.
How else could she do it?
How else could she do what?
How else could she make a bunny her baby brother without pretending?
Well, she couldn't.
It's just that she has such a vivid imagination I have to keep reminding her.
I see.
May we sit down?
Oh, let's.
Samantha when Tabatha was born, I made it a strict rule that I would never interfere with how you and Darrin chose to raise her.
I know, and we appreciate it.
However, rules are made to be broken.
So I hope you won't be offended when I tell you I think you're making a big mistake.
What's my big mistake?
Samantha, you are an overprotective mother.
You don't expose your daughter to other kids.
She has no playmates.
That's why she wants to make a stuffed rabbit her baby brother.
The child is desperately in need of companionship.
Mother Stephens, I understand what you're trying to say, but Do you consider her too good for other children?
No.
We consider her We consider her Can I get you a cup of coffee?
Samantha, dear, you're stalling.
Now, why don't you just admit I'm right?
Okay.
You're right.
I'll make a mental note to expose Tabatha to other children.
Fine.
You can start with Michael Millhowser.
Who's Michael Millhowser?
He is the 5-year-old son of Stanley and Gretchen Millhowser.
Gretchen is the daughter of one of my dearest and oldest friends.
She and her family just moved here from Chicago and they don't know a soul.
Well, we must invite them over.
When?
Next week?
Oh, I'm sure they'd love it.
In the meantime Gretchen has invited you and Tabatha to their house.
- She has?
- In 15 minutes.
I took the liberty of accepting for you.
But Mother Stephens we were looking forward to spending the morning with you.
I'm going with you.
I haven't seen Michael since he was a baby.
- Mother Stephens?
- Yes, dear?
I'll go get Michael's playmate.
Hello, Gretchen, dear, how are you?
Aunt Phyllis, good to see you.
Gretchen Millhowser, this is my daughter-in-law, Samantha and my granddaughter, Tabatha.
- Pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?
Come in.
Just step over the toys.
I believe in a lived-in atmosphere for children.
It gives them a sense of belonging.
Tabatha, my son, Michael, is very anxious to meet you.
Michael, darling, come here.
I don't believe it.
Look how big he is!
Michael, I want you He's busy playing dive-bomber.
Well, I have an appointment at the beauty shop.
I'll leave you two younger generations alone so you can get acquainted.
I'll let myself out.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.
In due time, Michael will learn to put his things away himself.
But I don't wanna force him.
I want him to do it out of his own sense of pride.
Oh, yes.
Michael, don't you wanna come over and meet two beautiful ladies?
No.
He's a little shy about extra-familial contacts.
What about his contacts with the wall?
After we get settled, we're repainting.
Michael, would you like to take our company outside and show them your play yard?
No.
He's releasing the hostility caused by being uprooted to a new environment.
We'll go to the play yard without him.
And he'll follow us from a need for group identification.
Really?
How many children do you have?
Just one.
But an active one.
Well, I've never seen anything like it.
You have enough equipment to open a nursery school.
My husband and I believe in physical exercise as a means of sublimating anxiety.
Go ahead, Tabatha, play with anything you like.
Where do you and your husband entertain your friends?
You mean when we have barbecues, things like that?
- Yes.
- Oh, we have a little area outside the service porch.
All we have to do is move the garbage cans.
Get off.
Michael dearest, there are two other swings.
- I want this one.
- It's his favourite.
That's all right.
Come on, Tabatha.
Come on.
You can swing on this one.
There now, Michael.
Now you have your swing.
I don't want it.
Do you have other children?
No, not yet.
Do you feel an only child has greater difficulty in resolving the Oedipus conflict?
Well, I'm not sure.
I guess I haven't given it much thought.
But I feel an only child makes it easier on the grocery bill.
Look.
They're both in the same sandbox.
Is that good or bad?
It depends on how they orient their behaviour patterns.
Let's leave them on their own.
Mrs. Stephens, we really should leave them on their own.
Good.
How do you do that?
Your mother must be pleased to have you living near her.
I think so.
Of course, she's thrilled to be able to see more of Michael.
I can imagine.
Even though he's a bit of a challenge.
Yes, I sensed that.
Stop that.
Make me.
Help!
Mom!
That's Michael's frustration scream.
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!
Get me out of here.
Tabatha.
What happened?
She locked me in a cage and took away my wagon.
There's an example of the imagination of a child with a free spirit.
Fantastic.
Tabatha, give Michael back his wagon.
I'm terribly sorry.
Forget it.
Let's finish our coffee.
Tabatha hasn't learned to share, has she?
- I don't like you.
- I don't like you.
- I wish I was a doggy.
- Why?
So I could bite you to pieces.
I wish I was a doggy.
I wish so too.
What's that noise?
I guess they're playing with your dog.
We don't have a dog.
Tabatha.
Tabatha, where's Michael?
Tabatha, you didn't!
You couldn't.
You did?
Michael.
Where did that come from?
It's probably a stray.
And where's Michael?
Oh, he's probably hiding.
Michael.
Michael, where are you?
Michael.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
He went around in front.
I'm coming, dear.
I'm coming.
Tabatha, I'm ashamed of you.
Hi, Gretchen.
There was some mix-up in appointments.
They had me down for tomorrow so I thought I'd come back and see how things were going.
Where did that dog come from?
I have no idea, but I wish he'd go away.
Get away.
Get, get Did you see that?
He tried to bite me.
I've got a good mind to call the dog pound and have him taken away.
I wouldn't do that.
The dog is probably just suffering from a disorientation trauma compounded by a fear of rejection.
How do you know that?
Well, when you think of it, how much different is a dog from a child?
Tabatha, that was a very naughty thing to do.
Wishing Michael into a bulldog.
It was a "accent".
An accent?
You mean an accident.
How was it an accident?
He wished he was a doggy.
I wished so too.
Tabatha, when are you going to learn that just because you wish something were so, that you mustn't "wishcraft" it to happen.
Now, you see what I mean is, you must control Michael?
Michael Millhowser.
If you find him, you tell Gretchen immediately.
She's searching the house from top to bottom.
And that stupid bulldog is following her.
Tabatha.
Come on, get down.
Come on.
Now, listen.
We have to change Michael back.
I suppose I should say you have to change him because it's your spell.
Should I close my eyes and wish?
Yes.
And wish as hard as you can.
Are you wishing as hard as you can?
Yes.
Well, relax, sweetheart.
I guess you're too young to do it unless the victim's right here with you.
He just doesn't seem to be anywhere around.
But you mustn't do it in front of Mrs. Millhowser or Grandma Stephens.
- Any luck?
- No.
He's a good hider.
I wish he'd come back, but I'm gratified that when he does something, he does it well.
I'm sure he's around somewhere.
Look at that.
It's as if he's trying to tell you something.
I don't wanna listen to him.
I wanna listen to my baby.
Come and get me, I'm out front!
Come on.
Come on, Michael.
Come on.
Now, Tabatha what Mommy did was ventriloquism with a dash of witchcraft.
I want you to hurry up and wish Michael back into a Hold it, hold it.
Hold it?
Yes.
She was gonna play a game with the doggy.
But now that you're here, she'd much rather play with you.
That's sweet.
I wonder if he could've run away from home.
You're right.
I'll go see if he has an identification tag.
Samantha, come back.
I was talking about Michael.
Michael.
Michael, you come back here.
Michael.
Michael, come here.
Michael.
Michael, come on.
Be a good boy.
Dog.
Come on, Michael.
Enough is enough.
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, Tabatha.
Come on.
Now, you wish Michael back into a little boy.
And don't fool around.
Close your eyes.
We looked all over, and we ju - Michael.
- He was hiding out back.
My son, my darling, my sweetheart, my angel.
Michael, I know you didn't do it on purpose but you made Mommy very worried.
Where were you?
Please, I can handle this.
Michael, dear, where were you?
I was a doggy.
Michael, as you well know Daddy and I encourage childhood fantasies as beneficial to psychogenic development.
But this is going just a little bit too far.
As your mother, I ask you again, where were you?
I was a doggy.
He's a stubborn little boy, isn't he?
Samantha, what do you think?
About what?
About a child who compulsively insists on fibbing.
Oh, that.
Well, I think that in this case I'd make an allowance.
You see, that stray bulldog may have frightened Michael into a trauma.
Of what specific nature?
Well, that's hard to say.
A psychogenic trauma?
You may be right.
However, there's also a possibility that I may have committed a tactical error.
Of what specific nature?
Of being too permissive.
Of letting a 5-year-old boy run my life instead of my running his.
Well, there is a group that advocates the use of discipline.
And I belong to it.
Do you?
Oh, yes, I do.
I believe that children want a certain amount of discipline.
To have limits on what they can get away with.
Because having to be a free spirit can be pretty exhausting.
And pretty confusing.
- Amen.
- That just might have some validity.
You know what?
I'm going to take a whack at it.
Michael, go clear all your junk out of the living room.
Then I'll give you and Tabatha some milk and cookies.
I don't want any milk.
I don't want any cookies.
And I want her to go home.
I'll give you and Tabatha some milk and cookies and you will finish your milk to the last drop.
- Is that clear?
- Yes, ma'am.
All right, Michael, move out.
Yes, ma'am.
How did that sound?
Fine.
How did it feel?
It felt sensational.
I'll get the milk and cookies.
Samantha.
Yes, Mother Stephens?
What happened to the bulldog?
I think he finally heard his master's voice.
All right, sweetheart.
You and your new bunny have a nice nap, okay?
Bunny hop.
I'll bet after playing with Michael all day Tabatha will have a nice, long nap.
I bet she will too.
Aren't you glad I talked you into going?
Very.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
Oh, nothing.
And you and your daughter have each made a nice new friend.
Yes, we have.
So aren't you glad I talked you into going?
Very.
Well, goodbye, Mother Stephens.
We'll see you soon.
Goodbye, dear.
- Oh, Samantha?
- Yes.
Give my son my love.
I will.
I promise.
Tabatha, one of these days you are going to make your mother a nervous wreck.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Now, Tabatha, you mustn't be cranky.
I want you to lie down and go to sleep.
You had no nap this afternoon, and if Tabatha.
Oh, Tabatha!
Good evening, dear.
Oh, hi.
Oh, that's very cute.
Probably saw some mortal friend of yours do that at a cocktail party.
Samantha, you're bringing this child up in the wrong environment.
And speaking of wrong environment where's what's-his-name?
Darrin is in Chicago for the weekend on business.
Splendid.
While he's gone we can take Tabatha over to that witch's nursery school in Tibet where you learned to fly.
- Mother.
- What?
You are not helping me one bit by putting ideas in her head.
Now, there are only two things that I want: For Tabatha to go to sleep, and for you to blow.
Blow!
Oh, Mother.
Tabatha.
Dear.
Now, listen, young lady.
You just leave that right there.
Now, I mean it.
You be a good girl I said no!
Well, if you can't beat them, join them.
- Hello?
- Samantha, darling.
Oh, hello, Louise.
Larry and I were just talking about you.
We want you to come to dinner tonight.
Oh, well, that's very sweet of you, Louise.
And I'd love to come, but I can't.
I don't have a sitter.
We won't take no for an answer.
- You won't?
- We insist.
Surely you can find a babysitter in the neighbourhood.
Well, I daresay there are some sitters in the neighbourhood.
But at the risk of sounding like an over-indulgent mother l'm very choosy, and not just anyone can sit with Tabatha.
Then you leave everything to us.
Larry will be there in 20 minutes.
He'll bring our own babysitter, my Aunt Harriet.
Your Aunt Harriet?
- Is that a crack at my aunt?
- No, it's not a crack.
She can't stand any more.
She's already as cracked as they come.
Not another word, Samantha.
It's all taken care of.
Larry's on his way.
Bye.
No.
Hello?
Hello?
Mother?
Mother, you come back here this minute.
Mother!
Mother?
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Samantha.
I'd like you to meet Louise's Aunt Harriet.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Fine, I guess.
Been sitting for us ever since that handsome little replica of me was born.
Well, you've given me a few nights off for good behaviour.
Oh, where is it?
Where's what?
We left it in the back of the car.
I'll get it.
No, no.
I'll get it.
I don't want you to touch it.
It might pick up the wrong vibrations.
What is she talking about?
Her crystal ball.
Crystal ball?
She's always trying to contact the next world.
Next world?
Cute, isn't she?
Larry.
Larry, I really think that l Louise would never forgive me if you back out now.
If you don't come to dinner tonight, Darrin is fired.
- What?
- Well, maybe I am being a bit melodramatic, but it's a melodramatic situation.
We're in a tough spot.
There is an ulterior motive.
We invited a client and his wife to dinner.
A Mr. Baker.
We're trying to get him to modernize his packaging.
Larry, you know that there isn't anything I wouldn't do to help you.
Sam, you're not getting the message.
The plan is for you, Louise and Mrs. Baker to gang up on him tonight.
The women's point of view.
- Women buy his product, and - Here we are.
I just know I'm gonna have a wonderful time tonight.
I may even contact Mr. Henderson.
- Who?
- He's the man I was engaged to for 20 years.
I refused to marry him because he drank.
He's in the spirit world now.
Sounds more like he was in the spirit world before he left.
Well, come on, Sam.
We wanna be there when the Bakers arrive.
Wait a minute, Larry.
I really ought to be here just in case Darrin calls long distance.
Don't worry.
I'll tell him to call you at the Tates'.
Oh, where is your little Tabatha?
Larry and Louise say she's a darling.
Yes.
Well, she's in the nursery.
It's the door on the left at the top of the stairs.
She's asleep, I hope.
Okay.
Let's go.
You go ahead and have a good time.
I know how it is with young mothers.
Worry, worry.
Yes.
Silly, isn't it?
Mr. Baker, I've been buying your brand of food for years.
Naturally.
It's the best in the world.
- Samantha.
- Oh, thanks, Louise.
But, you know, sometimes I have difficulty finding it in the stores.
Oh, I have the same trouble.
Yes, thank you.
It's probably because the packaging isn't spectacular enough to attract the eye of the discerning housewife.
Edgar, haven't I always told you the package should have a modern look.
Something that would appeal to today's woman.
My Uncle Willie designed that package.
New packaging would make your product sell five times as fast.
Putting a new package on a great old product would be like putting a miniskirt on Whistler's Mother.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I think I ought to call home and make sure everything's all right.
Oh, relax, Samantha.
Everything's all right.
Mr. Henderson, I know that you're in there.
Mr. Henderson, I know that you're in there.
Horsy, go for a walk.
Mr. Henderson, come forth.
Mr. Henderson, I suddenly feel cold air.
Could that be you?
No, it can't be you.
I'm sure you're in a much warmer place.
I want my ball.
Is that you?
If you're really here, knock once.
Ball up.
I've done it.
I've done it.
I knew I could reach you.
I know you're here.
Where are you, Mr. Henderson?
Mr. Henderson, where are you?
Horsy, come home.
Mr. Henderson, what are you trying to tell me?
Reincarnation?
You've come back as a horse!
Baker, here you have the opinion of three women symbolic of the purchasing power of this nation, and I'll get it.
Excuse me.
Furthermore, Mr. Baker, consumers' research has proved beyond a doubt that women control the purse strings of the nation.
What?
Hello?
Hello?
We were cut off.
Louise's aunt is babysitting with Tabatha.
She probably woke up and started to cry.
I'm the only one that can quiet her, so I'd better go.
The phone doesn't ring.
Louise, I'm sure that everything is all right.
I just take Sam home and then we'll come right back.
I'll get my coat.
Excuse me.
She said something about conjuring up a real live ghost.
A ghost?
There's no such thing as ghosts.
I believe in ghosts.
What do you think, Louise?
Well, let's just say that I'm neutral on the subject.
But it's my Aunt Harriet, so perhaps I'd better go with Samantha.
Would you mind if I went too?
You know all my life I've wanted to see a real ghost.
Agnes, how many times have I told you?
There are no such things as ghosts.
Seeing is believing.
Agnes, you're being ridiculous.
Come on, Mr. Baker.
Let's humour the girls.
All right.
Where's everybody going?
To your house, to see the ghost.
I'll get my hat.
What ghost?
Probably the ghost of my advertising business.
That's how fast it's dying.
Come on in, everyone.
Aunt Harriet.
Don't disturb the vibrations.
Vibrations?
I'm trying to get him back.
- Get who?
- The ghost of Mr. Henderson.
He's here?
The last I saw him, he went upstairs with his horse.
His horse?
She's your aunt?
Only by marriage.
Only by marriage.
He must still be around.
Oh, isn't this exciting?
Agnes, come back here.
I was sitting right here on the couch and suddenly I felt cold air.
How weird.
We have the draftiest house in town.
I asked the crystal ball to contact Mr. Henderson and have him knock on the table, and he did.
Only by marriage.
I might want an affidavit on that.
Wait a minute.
I know what happened.
You fell asleep and dreamed all this.
Don't be ridiculous.
If anyone has insomnia, it's me.
I haven't slept a wink in years.
She's sound asleep.
She came here to catch up.
All this commotion over nothing.
It was only a dream.
Let's all have a drink.
I'm way ahead of you, Tate.
I'll catch up.
Milk.
Well, now we can get back to business, Mr. Baker.
He's in the kitchen.
- Who?
- The ghost.
Don't start that all over again.
The whole thing was a dream.
Aunt Harriet, wake up.
I tell you, the ghost is in the kitchen.
I just saw him pour himself a glass of milk.
Milk?
That certainly doesn't sound like Mr. Henderson.
Unless he's developed an ulcer.
You've conjured up a real ghost.
Let's have a séance, right now.
- Agnes.
- Louise.
Edgar, I've always told you Uncle Willie would've stayed up with the times.
Aunt Harriet, do you think you could conjure up my husband's Uncle Willie?
Why not?
I'm hot tonight!
If we could only get him to talk to us!
That's what this whole thing has been leading up to.
You can't change me, so you try to change Uncle Willie by rigging this whole phony routine.
But But Mr. Baker.
My apologies, Mrs. Stephens, Mrs. Tate.
Come on, Agnes, we're leaving.
And your advertising agency no longer handles my account.
You can't do this.
She's a genuine clairvoyant.
Besides, she Edgar, please let me stay with my ghost.
I think we should be going home, Aunt Harriet.
Never mind your crystal ball.
We'll pick it up later.
But I did see the rocking horse floating through the room and I know that I'm right.
I don't wanna leave my crystal ball.
Larry.
We'll get it later, dear.
Larry.
Please don't be too hard on Aunt Harriet.
Those things that she said she saw, well, they were just part of a dream.
Or maybe part of a vivid imagination.
I'm the one who has a vivid imagination.
I can see $500,000 flying out the window.
- Samantha.
- Yes?
Nothing.
Sam, if you love Darrin, get him out of the advertising business while there's still time.
And with that, I proceeded to break the bank at Monte Carlo.
You're not listening to me, Samantha.
I said, I broke the bank at Monte Carlo.
Oh, it's all right.
We don't have any money in that bank.
After last night, we may end up without any money in our own bank.
What is that silly thing?
- Crystal ball.
- Oh, you're kidding.
All right, it's a cuff link for the Jolly Green Giant.
Well, that makes more sense.
And it just might be the solution to my problem.
If I knew what Uncle Willie looked like I could become him and talk Mr. Baker into changing his plans.
Come right in here, Samantha.
My dear, I'm so thrilled that you're doing this for me especially after the way my husband behaved last night.
Oh, don't be silly.
I wanted to help you contact Uncle Willie.
Is the coast clear?
Oh, yes.
Mr. Baker's in his study.
Is that Uncle Willie?
Oh, no.
I don't know who he is.
He's someone my husband got at an auction.
Uncle Willie's over there.
And I just can't wait to get started.
Well First, you have to concentrate on Uncle Willie.
Then, most important, you have to believe.
That's why I brought Aunt Harriet's crystal ball.
You know it works.
Oh, yes.
I saw that ghost pour himself a glass of milk with my own eyes.
Do you think I can reach Uncle Willie?
Oh, I'm positive.
Now, all you have to do is put your hands like this gaze into the crystal ball, and concentrate on Uncle Willie.
Well, shouldn't I say something?
Well, yes.
Yes, it might help if you said something like: "Uncle Willie, come forth".
Uncle Willie, come forth.
Uncle Willie, come forth.
It kind of gives me goose pimples.
Maybe it would help you concentrate if I stepped out to the patio.
All right.
Uncle Willie, come forth.
- Who are you?
- I'm Uncle Willie.
Sorry.
You must forgive me for being startled but it isn't every day that I meet a ghost.
That makes us even.
It isn't every day I meet a witch.
How do you know I'm a witch?
In my circle, word gets around.
Did Mrs. Baker conjure you up?
Of course not.
I've been haunting this house for 45 years.
Shaking my chain.
Moaning myself hoarse.
But they can't hear me, because they don't really believe.
Uncle Willie, come forth.
Why have you been trying to haunt them?
Why?
Because that blockhead nephew of mine is ruining my business.
I gave my whole life to that business and I want it run the way it ought to be run.
And with a little assistance from your witchcraft, I can do it.
Now, first, turn yourself back into me.
All right.
I look a lot worse than I thought.
Anyway, let me tell you a couple of things that will convince my nephew.
Uncle Willie, please come forth.
Uncle Willie, please, I want you to come forth.
Uncle Willie Agnes!
Are you out of your mind?
You know I've forbidden this kind of hocus-pocus around here.
If I've told you once, I've told you a million times.
There are no such things as ghosts.
- Who are you?
- Who do I look like?
You're an actor.
That Larry Tate, he put you up to this, didn't he?
You're no ghost.
What?
What kind of trick was that?
How'd you do it?
Here I am, over here.
I don't believe it, but I sure would like to know how you do it.
Maybe you'll be convinced that I'm Uncle Willie when I remind you of the time you put a frog in your Aunt Millie's bed.
And I whaled the tar out of you.
Uncle Willie?
Only you and I would know about that.
And the time I caught you putting molasses in your sister's shoes.
You are Uncle Willie.
When you say Uncle Willie, get down on your knees.
Yes, sir.
What do you want, Uncle Willie?
Your very last words to me were, "Don't tamper with the business".
And I didn't.
Now, you listen to me, you blockhead.
When I told you not to tamper with the business how did I know what progress there'd be in 50 years?
Haven't you the gumption to keep up with your competition?
Now, get on that phone, call Larry Tate.
Tell him to throw out our old trademark for something new.
Now, hop to it.
No, I can't do that, Uncle Willie.
After what I said to him, it would offend my dignity.
Very well.
When Agnes comes out of her faint l'll mention a certain blond stenographer who Oh, no.
I'm dialling.
Uncle Willie, I'm dialling.
See?
Look, I'm dialling.
Hello, Tate?
This is Baker.
Yes, I'd like to talk to you in the morning about getting a new packaging concept for our product.
I don't care what Uncle Willie wanted.
I'm running this business my way, and I believe in progress.
Hop to it.
I wanna see some ideas first thing in the morning.
Right.
Young lady, I could kiss you.
Oh, Uncle Willie!
This pie is absolutely delicious, Samantha.
Oh, thanks, Louise.
I made an extra one for your Aunt Harriet.
- I thought you could take it to her.
- Oh, great idea.
Anything to keep her from talking to that crystal ball.
Larry.
Louise, would you like some more coffee?
- No, thank you.
I'm fine.
- Thanks, Sam.
I thought we agreed not to discuss that again.
We did not agree.
You simply told me what you'd do to me if I did.
But I don't intimidate that easily.
- As Mr. Baker well knows.
- Mr. Baker?
Yes, I finally straightened him out.
You got the account back?
Well, there are times when a man in my position has to use his power and authority.
Mere tact and diplomacy is not enough.
One must meet a situation head-on.
I really laid down the law to him.
For his own good.
Larry, that was very considerate of you.
I told him, "Forget Uncle Willie".
From now on, he's to listen to me.
I'm an authority.
From now on, I'm his Uncle Willie.
And it worked?
He was putty in my hands.
Larry, I'm proud of you.
I always thought if you got Mr. Baker to change his mind he was the kind of man that would make it seem like his idea.
You know, like: "Hello, Tate.
This is Baker.
I wanna discuss a new packaging concept for our product.
I don't care what Uncle Willie wants.
I'm running the business my way, and I believe in progress.
Hop to it, Tate.
I wanna see those ideas on my desk tomorrow morning.
That was wonderful, Samantha.
Wasn't she cute, Larry?
Larry?
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
- Enjoy your dinner?
- Marvellous.
- Car check, please, sir.
- Yeah.
Right here.
Here you go.
- What's the matter?
- I left my gloves on the table.
You're improving.
You usually remember them halfway home.
- I'll go get them.
- I can save you the trouble.
Like this?
- You want me to?
- No.
I definitely, emphatically and positively do not.
- What time is the floorshow?
- There isn't any.
- Isn't this the Club Bimbo?
- No, it's La Petite Maison.
- Who stole the Club Bimbo?
- I'm afraid I don't know.
I get it.
Beautiful but dumb.
In that case, let's go straight to my apartment.
No, thank you.
Look, lady.
Please.
In three days, I gotta be in Cleveland.
Sir, you leave me alone.
Or I promise you'll regret it.
My spirit cannot be dampened.
That's what you think.
What's going on here?
- Are you her husband?
- Yes, I am!
Who are you?
I'm a reformed drunk.
Sam, what happened?
He tried to pick me up, so I dampened his spirit.
With real water?
By witchcraft!
- Well - Well what?
He was in no condition to drive.
I say the use of witchcraft was completely uncalled-for!
And I say it was my duty to the motoring public.
That's just an excuse.
You took fiendish delight in putting that guy in his place, and you know it.
Darrin, I resent that.
I am not a fiend.
I didn't say that.
I said you took fiendish delight.
Well, you can't take fiendish delight unless you're a fiend.
- You can too.
- You cannot.
- Boy, are you unreasonable!
- No.
You are.
That's what you always say.
Only as a last alternative.
In our four years of marriage, I have been through 2856 last alternatives.
I never knew you kept score.
I don't.
I meant that as a wild exaggeration.
- Samantha.
- Yes, dear.
It's my considered opinion that you use witchcraft at the drop of a hat.
And furthermore, that you love it.
Darrin, that's not your considered opinion.
You're saying that because you're angry.
I'm not angry.
It's just that I'm tired of fighting a losing battle.
So I surrender.
Let's stop being hypocrites.
Let's tell the whole world your true identity.
Are you serious?
Why not?
Could my existence be more hectic?
- Yes.
- I doubt it very much.
Good night.
You're about to have a dream And, in the words of a great philosopher it's going to be a beaut.
We'll tell the whole world I'm a witch.
Let's start with Larry Tate.
Come in.
Larry, do you have a minute to talk to us?
To you, a minute, to Samantha, a lifetime.
What brings you to our happy little jungle?
- I do.
- It's all Darrin's idea.
- We have something to tell you.
- Let's see if I can guess.
My guess is he'll never guess.
I think we'd better sit down.
Sure.
It isn't your marriage, is it?
- Yes, it's our marriage.
- Well my advice is to just roll with the punches.
Larry, you don't understand.
Don't be greedy, Darrin.
You've had four good years, and now that they're over, cherish them.
That's a lovely thought, Larry.
May I write it down?
So when you yell and scream at each other, do it with kindness.
- Larry, that isn't our problem.
- Our problem is me.
Samantha is different.
- From whom?
- From you and me.
Well, naturally.
I'm a man, and you're a man and she's a woman.
- No, she isn't.
- She isn't a woman?
- No.
- I see.
Congratulations, sir.
That's an amazing disguise.
Darrin means that I am not a mortal woman.
I'm a witch.
Okay, kids.
You got your laugh.
Now run along and let me go back to work.
Larry, we're not kidding.
My wife is a witch.
Darrin, if you want a vacation, ask for it.
You don't have to go through this fruitcake routine.
Larry, I am a full-fledged card-carrying, cauldron-stirring witch.
All right, witch-wife.
Show me the old black magic.
Where'd she go?
Well, that That was done with mirrors.
How many mirrors?
Two?
You had them up your sleeves.
Well, how about two big mirrors?
The The little ones were expandable.
Are you all right, Larry?
- Samantha?
- Yes, Larry?
With my brains and your voodoo we can control the world.
Larry, let me explain how we made the adjustment in the past and how we hope to make the adjustment in the future.
Never mind the petty details.
Sam, with you on my team, at a generous salary I can juggle the stock market and seize control of the national economy.
That's true, Larry, but Today the nation, tomorrow the world!
Larry, take it easy.
I can't.
I'm mad with power.
Well, we're not.
We don't want to use my witchcraft to rule the world.
That's right.
And when you've had time to think it over, you'll decide I'll decide I wanna rule the world.
I've wanted to rule the world since I was a little kid.
We're sorry, Larry.
We really are.
Well, just because you two don't want anything for yourselves let's not forget old Lar.
- "Old Lar"?
I should be entitled to a modest amount of fallout, shall we say?
Just out of loyalty and friendship?
Larry, we refuse to use Samantha's power for material gains for ourselves or anyone else.
You sore because I want a piece of the action?
There isn't gonna be any of that kind of action.
All right, forget it.
Forgive me for being pushy.
I thank you for the information and now I find myself running late, so Sam.
Darrin.
Just one more thing.
- Yes, Larry?
- You're fired.
Larry wasn't a very good sport about that, was he?
Maybe it was just a fluke.
Let's see what happens when we tell the Kravitzes.
- Oh, please, come in.
- Go in, honey.
Is your wife home?
Abner?
Oh, hi there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
What an unexpected surprise.
We came to bring you a bit of neighbourhood gossip.
We did not.
We came to clear the air.
- About what?
- About who I am.
- Who are you?
- I am a witch.
I don't believe you.
Well, honestly.
I don't believe her.
It's true.
She's a witch.
I knew it!
I thought you didn't believe her.
I meant I didn't believe she'd ever admit it.
I believed she was a witch from the second I met her.
The problem is, you didn't believe me.
I still don't.
I don't believe all of you.
Where is it?
- Where's what?
- The candid camera.
I'm being embarrassed on coast-to-coast television.
Mr. Kravitz, there's no camera.
Unless you need one.
There.
Did you see that?
She conjured up a camera.
Look, now she changed the camera into a chicken.
Was that really necessary?
Well, you wanted me to convince him, didn't you?
Just let us live.
We're young and we wanna live.
If you must take one of us, take me.
But, Mr. Kravitz, I'm not a bad witch.
- I'm a good witch.
- Her mother's a bad witch.
Well, it's been nice chatting with you.
See you soon.
Well, sweetheart, how do you like it so far?
Keep dreaming, sweetheart.
It's a few weeks later.
We've told all our friends.
Somebody told the newspapers, and now you have your wish: The whole world knows our secret.
The whole world knows I'm a witch.
The whole world knows I'm a witch.
All right, folks, right this way.
Just one dollar for a comfortable seat across from where the witch lives.
Children, 50 cents.
The price of admission includes a thrilling lecture by Gladys Kravitz entitled, "The Samantha Stephens I Have Known and Feared".
- Way, you're in my way.
Peanuts, popcorn.
Peanuts, popcorn.
Peanuts, popcorn.
Right here.
Here comes a car.
- That's her husband.
- The witch's husband.
- Let's get his autograph.
- Yeah, let's go.
Mr. Samantha, may I have your autograph?
- Me too.
- Isn't he handsome?
May I have your tie for good luck?
I'm sorry, madam, but if you wanna fly to Florida for your vacation you're gonna have to do it by airplane.
My broom is booked for the season.
Hi there.
What's new?
Oh, not much.
- I got caught in a stampede - Excuse me.
Hello.
Speaking.
Mickey Mantle?
The Mickey Mantle?
Oh, Mr. Mantle, I'm surprised at you.
But that wouldn't be fair.
If I worked it out so that you could bat.
600 l'd have to let all the other players bat.
600.
And besides, I'm a Mets fan.
You're welcome anyhow.
Goodbye.
Oh, my.
This phone hasn't stopped ringing all day.
We'll have to change our number.
We've already changed it 10 times.
They keep tracking us down.
Well, how'd the job-hunting go today?
It went rotten.
Ever All my prospective employers either thought I was too controversial or they wanted to make a package deal.
You mean like Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax?
They'll only hire me if they can hire you so they can raise their profits by witchcraft.
Hi, sweetheart.
Daddy needs a kiss.
Tabatha?
Hon?
What's the matter with her?
She's depressed.
- By what?
- None of her friends will play with her.
- Because her mother's a witch?
- No.
Because her mother's a witch who won't give everyone a pony.
Poor kid.
Why should she be punished for my mistake?
You get it.
And if it's another moocher turn him into a chicken.
- Mrs. Darrin Stephens?
- Yes.
I'm Brigadier General Stanton.
This is Agent W of our top-secret organization, the HHH.
What does HHH stand for?
That's top-secret.
We'd like to confer with you and your husband.
Certainly.
Come in.
I'll get the door.
General Stanton, Agent W of the HHH my husband, Darrin Stephens.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- Who assaulted you?
- My fans.
General, next time they won't miss.
Stephens, I regret to inform you that you, your wife and your daughter are in grave personal danger.
We are?
Washington has been flooded with letters and telegrams demanding that you all be burned at the stake.
Well, that's ridiculous.
Witch-burning went out in the 17th century.
It's being revived.
- May we be seated?
- Please.
We have reason to believe that a blueprint for your destruction is nearing completion.
They're gathering firewood from Maine to California.
Oh, piffle.
Mrs. Stephens, to the security of the United States of America I assure you it is not piffle.
- Why not?
- Because we need you.
Thank you.
Not you.
Her.
You are an American witch, aren't you?
- Yes.
- And will you use your powers to defend your country?
- No.
- Yes, she will.
- Darrin.
You don't want me to use my witchcraft for anything.
That was my old policy.
My new policy is - Is what?
- Whatever best serves my country.
That's well-spoken, son.
We want to take the three of you into protective custody so we can interrogate your wife thoroughly and, at the same time, keep you and your child under armed guard.
In other words, you want us to become military prisoners.
- Guests.
- Where?
We haven't decided.
We thought your wife might help us.
Well, I'd be happy to.
What type of place did you have in mind?
Someplace isolated.
Say, for instance, an abandoned military installation somewhere in the middle of a desert, with maximum security.
A nice concentration-camp atmosphere.
Yes, that's it.
- When would you like us to leave?
- The sooner, the better.
Tabatha?
Would you come down here a minute?
By the way, she is a witch.
There are others.
My mother and Aunt Clara and my daddy and Uncle Arthur are warlocks.
And so is Aunt Enchantra, Aunt Hagatha, cousin Oh, here, sweetheart.
You come over here and stand still, all right?
Yes, Mommy.
Well, alrighty.
Darrin, are you ready?
Ready?
Excuse me.
- Ready for what?
- To do our patriotic duty.
There go three great Americans.
- Where are we?
- We're in protective custody.
That trailer is our new home, and this is our recreation area.
- How do you like it?
- I hate it!
Mrs. Stephens, Miss Stephens, interrogation time.
Yes, sir.
Come on, sweetheart.
Why are they taking Tabatha?
Because little American witches grow into big American witches.
Goodbye, Daddy, I love you.
- I love you.
- So do I. - Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
Let me out!
- Yes, sweetheart.
- Let me out!
Yes, I'll let you out right this minute.
Your magic dream is now all over Samantha, come back!
Come back from where?
You're here.
And I'm here.
- Where's Tabatha?
- Well, she's in her bedroom.
Why?
Well, because Because I was Oh, nothing.
I just Nothing.
Good Good night, Sam.
Good night, sweetheart.
Pleasant dreams.
- Good morning, ladies.
- Morning, sweetheart.
- Good morning, Daddy.
- Good morning.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a tot.
Darrin, I've been thinking about what you said last night.
What I said about what?
About telling the world our secret.
- Let's do it.
- Honey, wait a second No, I want to confess.
I want to breathe the air of truthfulness.
- But But But - Don't you?
No!
I mean, I like things the way they are.
We may have our ups and downs, but by and large, we're pretty happy.
So let's not rock the boat.
Okay?
Well, okay.
- If you insist.
- I insist.
What made you change your mind?
Oh, you might say I slept on it.
- Slept on it?
- Yes.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
- When is Daddy coming home?
- In about a week.
When is a week?
About seven tomorrows.
Be good and eat your dinner if you want Daddy to bring you a surprise.
What's that?
You finish your dinner, I'll see who it is.
One more time.
Aunt Clara.
Oh, my stars.
Oh, dear.
That could give you quite a headache.
Especially if you already have a headache.
- Yeah.
- What's the matter, Aunt Clara?
- It's Ocky.
- Your boyfriend?
- My ex-boyfriend, if you don't mind.
- Again?
This is the third time he's run away with some empty-headed witch.
And I told him that under no circumstances would I ever take him back.
Well, good for you.
The problem is now suppose he takes me seriously.
- Oh, hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
I was just driving by and I thought I'd drop in, see how you were doing.
Just fine.
How's everything with you?
Terrible.
Boy, I can't wait for Darrin to get back.
Come on in and tell me what's wrong.
Did Darrin ever talk to you about Mishimoto?
Not that I remember.
Well, Mishimoto is one of the biggest television manufacturers in Japan.
And we've been corresponding with him almost eight months about our handling his account.
And I just got word that he's flying in from Tokyo tomorrow to talk to us.
- Well, that's good, isn't it?
- It's terrible.
You know Louise is away.
How am I gonna entertain him?
- I can't take him to a restaurant.
- No, of course not.
Why not?
Because to an Oriental, being invited to dinner at someone's home has an important significance.
I wouldn't wanna get off on the wrong foot.
Especially since the account will probably be assigned to Darrin.
- Well, Larry, why not invite him here?
- Here?
Well, that never occurred to me.
Oh, Sam, I couldn't ask you to do that.
I'd be pleased to.
What do you serve a Japanese visitor?
Japanese food he may be sick and tired of or Western food he might not like.
Sam, I just happened to phone Mishimoto's secretary in Japan and found out that his favourite dish is Hung Ai Wan Goo Rash.
- Clever?
- Very.
- What is it?
- Who knows?
Do you want me to make Hung Ai Wan Goo Rash without a recipe?
Sam, you are not dealing with an amateur, you know.
Japanese recipes.
- All you have to do is look it up.
- I see.
Boy, am I glad I dropped in.
Well, you sure dropped in well-prepared.
This is going to be fun.
Aunt Clara can help me.
Good girl.
Sam, I'm putting you in my will for this.
- I'll call you tomorrow.
Bye.
- Bye-bye, Larry.
Here.
Taste this.
- What is it?
- It's the sauce that goes on the raw fish.
- Well, I'm just about set.
- Oh, want to check up on the table?
- Oh, sure.
Yeah, all right.
- Good.
Aunt Clara, I thought you set the table.
I did.
You're in the wrong room.
What?
Well, my dear a Japanese dinner doesn't taste Japanese unless you're sitting on the floor.
Well, you certainly get A for effort.
You know, I've been thinking.
Why not go the whole hog?
Pardon?
Aunt Clara - It's not becoming?
- Oh, yes, it's lovely, very.
But since I'm not wearing a kimono, you might stand out.
- Do you follow me?
- Yes, yeah.
Well There they are.
I hope you don't mind.
I don't mind at all.
- Well.
- Hello, Larry.
You didn't tell us this was going to be a costume party.
- It was a last-minute thought.
- That's what you get for thinking.
Mr. Mishimoto, may I present Mrs. Stephens.
- Mrs. Stephens, a great pleasure.
- Well, it's a pleasure to meet you.
May I take your hat?
I hope you don't mind my wearing Japanese clothes.
It's just that I find them so comfortable as well as so flattering, don't you agree?
Oh, yes.
I think it is charming of you.
And I thank you for the tribute.
I told you she was something special, didn't I, Mr. Mishimoto?
Oh, leave it to Samantha to come up with a charming idea like this.
- How do you do?
- Larry.
This is Aunt Clara.
It is?
Oh, of course.
I didn't recognize you with the Mr. Mishimoto, may I present my Aunt Clara.
How do you do?
Oh, forgive me for staring but you look remarkably like someone I once knew.
My wife.
And she was very beautiful.
Was she?
If this is a surprise, don't tell me, but what is this?
Well, since we were having Japanese food Aunt Clara and I thought we would serve Japanese-style.
Oh, good, good.
Say, I think this will amuse you.
On the way out here, Mr. Mishimoto told me that he has a French chef.
- Really?
- Really.
Well, then a Japanese dinner will be a nice change, won't it?
Definitely.
You see I have spent most of my life abroad.
First at Oxford and then representing my company in the capitals of the world.
And now that I am back in Tokyo I am afraid I find myself very much in the position of a Western visitor.
I think we could all use a little drink.
- Sake, anyone?
- No.
Whiskey and soda, no ice please.
And eventually, with Mrs. Mishimoto gone I tired of travelling and felt a great desire to return to my homeland.
Have you ever been to Japan?
Oh, yes.
I've spent a lot of time over Japan.
Over Japan?
Back in the days when I used to fly without any trouble.
You used to fly?
How very interesting.
Sam, you never told me she was a pilot.
I didn't.
I mean, I didn't?
Mr. Mishimoto, before Stephens left, he prepared a very interesting graph showing the average sales increase of our clients from the time we took over their accounts.
You'll find There will be plenty of time to discuss that later.
Madam, I find it fascinating that you used to fly.
Oh, well, I still manage once in a while.
Really?
I have my own plane.
Perhaps sometime you would fly with me?
Well, that's very sweet of you, but I wouldn't dare go up in a plane.
Oh, that's very funny, Aunt Clara.
She has the kind of sense of humour that sort of sneaks up on you.
Yeah.
Next time, give us a little warning.
I think we're all ready for dessert, so if you'd like to get up and circulate I don't, but I think my blood does.
- Please let me help you, madam.
- I will if you don't call me "madam".
The name is Clara.
Why don't you get Clara to help you clear the dishes?
- I can handle it.
- Yes, but I can't handle her.
Oh, relax, Larry.
It's better for the digestion.
Mr. Mishimoto don't you think that since you'll be returning home day after tomorrow we ought to use this evening?
- There will be time.
Clara may I ask quite frankly how you would feel about going out to dinner with me?
- Oh, no.
- I see.
I couldn't eat another thing tonight.
Your niece is quite correct.
Your humour does take one unaware.
Sam, will you come back in and help me break this up?
What for?
All the attention Aunt Clara's getting from Mr. Mishimoto is just the therapy she needs right now.
I know, but if I don't get a little attention from Mr. Mishimoto l'm the one who's going to need therapy.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
Darrin just called from San Francisco.
I told him about the wonderful time Clara is having with Mr. Mishimoto.
That's precisely what I called about.
How is the toast of New York?
Mr. Mishimoto took her to a fashion show.
Sam, with all due respect, can I point out Mishimoto didn't fly all the way from Tokyo just to entertain your aunt.
It seems to me that's his business.
No, it's my business, which is going down the drain.
He's been so busy escorting Clara all over he hasn't had time for me the entire week he's been here.
Apparently, you're not as captivating as my aunt.
All right.
But do you mind if I come over and stake out a claim to some of Mishimoto's time?
Call me and let me know when I can casually run into him.
All right.
I will.
Bye-bye.
Good evening, my dear.
Oh, I had a marvellous time.
Marvellous time.
And the clothes were beautiful.
And Kensu, he has exquisite taste.
- Exquisite taste.
- Kensu?
Yes.
Mr - Mr. Mishimomo.
- Yes.
- Do you like it?
- Oh, it's beautiful.
Well, Kensu was very anxious for me to take it.
Well Oh, dear, I must go and get ready.
Oh, my.
We're going dancing this evening.
- Aunt Clara?
- Yes.
Don't you think that maybe you're overdoing it?
You've spent every day and every evening with him.
Maybe you ought to let Mr. Mishimoto have a little time to himself.
I've suggested that.
He won't hear of it.
But tonight Tonight, I must see him tonight because he's going to ask me a very, very important question.
Oh, dear, I hope I know the answer.
It's the only way.
Handrum, jandrum Wishing weaver Find for me the old deceiver On wings of night And wires of steel Tak e my message to that heel Just a moment, please.
- Aunt Clara.
- Yes?
Telephone for you.
Oh, yes.
Oh, now that must be Kensu calling to see if I'm ready.
- No.
No, no.
It's not Kensu.
- No?
Then who?
Hello?
For heaven's sake.
It's Ocky.
What do you want, Ocky?
Oh, really?
And what about you and that little witch?
Oh, good.
Now you know what it feels like.
You will?
Well, where are you?
Yes.
Oh, yes, I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Goodbye my love.
He wants me again.
Oh, dear.
Listen, you don't think it's wrong of me to?
Oh, Aunt Clara.
You're doing what your heart tells you is right, and that's seldom wrong.
Well.
Well, it's flight time.
Oh, that's great.
Just great.
But how did you get her boyfriend to call?
Oh, I just used a little black magic.
Just a little Oh, Sam, you're the end.
But it's the first break I've had with Mishimoto and I want you to know I'm grateful.
- You are?
Then suppose you tell him Aunt Clara's gone.
What's the problem?
- Well, he may be very upset.
- Oh, nonsense.
He's a grown man.
He'll take it in stride.
Just be simple and direct.
Simple and direct.
Good evening, Mr. Mishimoto.
What a surprise.
Good evening.
Did Clara not tell you I was coming?
Oh, sure.
It's just You're a little early, aren't you?
I said 6:30.
It is now 6:29.
Oh, that's what I meant.
I didn't expect you for another minute.
You know Larry Tate.
Yes, of course you do.
Long time no see.
How about a drink?
Whiskey and soda, no ice?
Sam, isn't there something you wanted to tell Mr. Mishimoto?
Yes.
Mr. Mishimoto a close friend of Aunt Clara's, a dear friend needed her, and so she had to go to him.
It was in the nature of a reconciliation.
She wanted us to make her apologies and she hoped you'd understand.
You have both been very gracious and hospitable.
Should you ever come to Tokyo, I would be happy to reciprocate.
Mr. Mishimoto, you talk as if you were leaving.
I am.
There is a plane for Tokyo in one hour.
But But what about our business?
Your account?
Our representing you, I mean.
I am afraid that is no longer possible.
Goodbye.
Boy, I have heard of soreheads, but this guy Mr. Mishimoto, I don't think you're really being You're wasting your time.
I've never heard of such childishness.
Mr. Mishimoto may have English clothes and a French chef but basically he's still an Oriental.
He was embarrassed in front of you.
"Losing face" is what they call it.
And if you lose face with somebody, it can put you at a disadvantage.
Say, you really know your Orientals, don't you?
Very clever.
Wait a minute.
- I'm getting an idea.
- Yeah?
Suppose I go to the airport and head him off before he gets on the plane.
Yeah.
Then what?
I don't know.
I said I was getting an idea, I didn't say I had one.
So you will please have my bags packed and sent to me in Tokyo and likewise with the hotel bill.
Mrs. Stephens?
Oh, Mr. Mishimoto, am I glad I ran into you.
Are you going somewhere?
Well, it's a long story, and I don't want to bother you but tell me, could you use an English-speaking secretary in your business?
- You are going to Tokyo?
I might.
I just know I can't stay here any longer.
What happened?
Well, if you must know, Mr. Tate was very angry at me because his business deal with you fell through.
When my husband finds out about it, there will be no living with him.
Why should Mr. Tate be angry with you?
Well, as you know, Aunt Clara is my aunt.
- And, well, if it weren't for her - So he blames you?
That is foolish.
But you don't think it's wrong for you to blame him?
It is not the same thing.
You mean it's all right for you to lose face but not me?
I am afraid you are oversimplifying things.
Am I?
Mr. Mishimoto are you really so upset over the loss of Aunt Clara or is it just because you were embarrassed?
Well, what I mean to say is aren't you more concerned over what we think rather than the way you feel?
- Well, l Anything wrong?
I must have my eyes examined as soon as I return home.
Yamato Airways, flight number 32 to Tokyo is now boarding at gate 16.
- I must leave.
Goodbye.
Why, hello.
Do we know each other?
I don't know.
I just had an impulse to say hello to you.
Well, that was very friendly of you.
- Perhaps we met on the Tokyo flight?
- Oh, yes, that's probably it.
- You are returning?
- Yes.
Oh, what a shame.
I am just about to start a two-week vacation here.
- Oh, really?
- And I don't know a soul in New York.
- Well, too bad.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
- One moment.
- Yes?
Actually, I have left some unfinished business here.
And, yes, I see no reason why I cannot postpone my return.
Oh, that would be very nice.
You little dickens.
This is very good of you to invite me to lunch.
- I'm delighted to have you.
- Delighted.
Mr. Mishimoto, Stephens will be back tomorrow and I thought we might meet at, say, 2:00?
I have a prior engagement.
Kensu is taking me to a double-header tomorrow.
All right.
Suppose we get an early start day after tomorrow?
Say, at 9?
That day we are going to the flower market in the morning a polo match in the afternoon and the movie premiere in the evening.
Well, they say that New York City is a summer festival.
Yes, but it's only spring.
When are you free?
After I leave, you will have plenty of time.
Larry, you haven't even tasted your chocolate mousse.
Does your chef make a good mousse?
That sounds funny, doesn't it?
Naturally, I mean chocolate mousse.
That reminds me, there's something I've been meaning to ask you.
Your secretary gave Mr. Tate the name of your favourite dish but I haven't been able to find it in the Japanese cookbook.
It's called Hung Ai Wan Goo Rash.
Hung Ai Wan Goo Rash?
I have never heard of it.
Isn't that strange?
Hung Ai Oh, this is priceless.
You know, my secretary's English is a little weak.
Do you know what she was trying to say?
No, what?
Hungarian goulash.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Okay, flight crew, are we ready?
A-okay, Daddy.
Roger.
Geronimo.
Clear for launch.
- Countdown.
Three, two, one.
- Blast off.
- I hate - Blast off.
Yes.
I hate to break up this moon mission, gang but Colonel Stephens and I have an ordinary Earth rendezvous at the Blakes'.
Ready in a minute, honey.
I know it's painful for you to give up your command Colonel Stephens, but be brave.
- Okay.
Okay.
Aunt Clara, you got everything straight?
Yes.
Yes, of course.
I think so.
Now let me see.
The Blakes' telephone number is in the icebox and the glass of milk is pinned to the bulletin board.
Or is it?
I've got an idea.
Instead of letting your Aunt Clara baby-sit why don't we stay home until Tabatha's 21?
Good night, Aunt Clara.
We'll be home early.
Roger.
Well, have a good time.
And everything's "O-akay".
All right, Tabatha.
One more flight, and we're off to bed.
Countdown, one, two.
Excellent, Tabatha, excellent.
You're a better spaceman than Dr. Spock.
Well, never mind.
I'll get it, and then off to bed.
Here, saucer.
Here, saucer.
Why, you naughty little saucer, you come right back here.
Flying saucer in dark est night Hark ye, land within my sight It's big.
Full moon Tide rise Shrink this saucer back to size It's still big.
Tabatha, it's definitely past your bedtime.
Come, dear.
But I'll be back.
Oh, boy, Orvis, this is a fine mess you've got us into this time.
It's not my fault, Alpha.
The controls are frozen.
You're the navigator, aren't you, dummy?
One minute we're flying over Parenthia, and then: We're a million miles away in outer space.
This proves one thing, though.
There is life on other planets.
They speak Parenthian too.
The question is, are they dangerous?
Don't worry, Orvis.
We have our N-guns for protection.
Hi, Aunt Clara.
Everything go all right?
Oh, hello, children.
Oh, yes, yes.
Everything's all right.
- And Tabatha's asleep in bed.
- Good.
Well, it was a very uneventful evening.
Almost.
- What do you mean, "Almost"?
- What does she mean, "Almost"?
What do you mean, "Almost"?
Well, Darrin, you know that little toy saucer that you like so much?
Yes.
What about it?
- Well, you're going to love it now.
- I am?
Well, there's so much more of it to love.
All right, Aunt Clara.
Out with it.
Well Now, sweetheart.
Try and keep an open mind.
It's a wonder I can keep any mind at all.
- Well, what do you think?
- I think you've done it again.
Well, it's quite easy to explain.
You see, the saucer flew around and flew out the door.
And I couldn't find it.
So I wanted to zap it back, and, well l'm afraid I didn't realize my own strength.
I'm impressed.
Now, please shrink it.
Oh, but I tried to, and nothing happened.
The first one is back, and it's brought more of them.
Look at the ridiculous ears on the tall one.
Sam, you've got to cut this thing down to size, and quick.
Well, I wish I could, sweetheart, but, you see, it's Aunt Clara's - Aunt Clara's spell.
- Well, you're catching on.
But I'm sure that after a good night's sleep Aunt Clara will be able to reverse the spell.
Okay.
But if that thing doesn't fit into the toy box the first thing in the morning, I'll tak e a hacksaw and do it myself.
Did you hear that?
He's coming back in the morning to destroy us.
If he aims his hacksaw at us we'll blast him with the N-gun.
I knew it.
I was right.
There was a noise last night, and it was caused by that flying saucer.
Just wait till Mr. Abner "Know-it-All" Kravitz sees this.
Abner!
Abner, wake up!
Wake up!
Sophia, we'll motor down the Via Veneto together.
- Abner.
- Oh, it's you.
- What are you screeching about?
- An invasion.
- Right in our neighbourhood.
- Your mother's back?
In the Stephens' back yard.
I'd rather have her over there than here.
It's not my mother.
It's a flying saucer.
- You know what I think?
- What?
I think your curlers are wound too tight.
All right.
You don't have to believe me.
- I'm gonna call the Air Force.
- I gave up Sophia for this.
- Where's Aunt Clara?
- She's still asleep.
Asleep?
Sam, it's after 8:00.
We've gotta do something about that saucer before everyone sees it.
The doorbell.
What do we do now?
Relax, sweetheart.
We're not Bonnie and Clyde.
I'll get it.
I don't know why you just don't go around back and peek at the saucer.
Mrs. Kravitz, the Air Force doesn't peek.
It investigates.
- Yes?
Who is it?
- It's Mrs. Kravitz.
I've got to talk to you.
Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Kravitz, but I'm all out of sugar.
It's not about sugar, Mrs. Stephens.
It's about your flying saucer.
She knows.
What will we tell her?
Why not say it's for an ad campaign?
Wait a minute.
Why not say it's for an ad campaign?
- I just said that.
- That's where I heard it.
Hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
Why, Mrs. Kravitz, I didn't know you had sons in the service.
Very amusing, Mr. Stephens.
This just happens to be Colonel Burkett and Captain Tugwell of the Air Force.
Oh, is our TV antenna up a little too high?
Oh, no, Mrs. Stephens, but your neighbour claims she saw a flying saucer in your back yard.
A flying saucer?
You mean the thing in the back yard?
Well, I'm in the ad game, colonel, and I built that flying saucer to publicize a new space toy.
- Space toy?
- It's very authentic-looking.
You don't mind if we take a look, do you?
Of course not.
Right this way.
Gosh, it sure looks real to me.
Well, that's quite a compliment, captain coming from an expert like you.
What's it made of, Stephens?
Just odds and ends.
Colonel, the Air Force should know about this.
We are the Air Force.
- I'm sorry, Uncle Charlie.
- Tugwell, I got you in the Air Force.
If you don't stop with the "Uncle Charlie" I will get you in the infantry.
- Golly, Mom said Tugwell.
It doesn't look like a toy to me.
Say, did you bring a photographer?
- Would you like to take pictures?
- Yes.
This promotion can use all the publicity it can get.
- I'm sorry, Stephens.
This won't get any publicity from us.
As far as the Air Force is concerned, this investigation is closed.
Come along, Tugwell.
- Wait a minute.
Don't leave.
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Kravitz.
It looks to me like the ones in uniform are dangerous.
Maybe the other ones are friendly.
We might as well find out.
We can't stay in here forever.
Good idea.
You go.
I'll guard the ship.
Open the hatch, Orvis.
Boy, that was some pretty fancy footwork.
I'll go wake up Aunt Clara, and this toy will be back to normal in no time.
Samantha!
Oh, my stars.
How do you expect me to feel, with a real flying saucer with real spacemen sitting in my back yard?
You don't realize what's happened.
Your Aunt Clara topped herself.
She started an invasion from outer space.
Now, Darrin, it's not an invasion from outer space.
Aunt Clara's spell just went wrong.
See, she's working on the counter-spell.
Sure.
I think I'll go into the kitchen and get a cup of coffee.
Sam.
Honey, I think you're taking this too lightly.
This is a spaceship from an alien planet.
I know.
- Cute, isn't it?
- I'm reporting this to the Air Force.
What do we do now, Alpha?
He wants to turn us in.
She hasn't lost the argument yet.
We'll just wait.
- How long can we wait?
- Will you please stop arguing so I can hear them arguing?
Whatever is in there may be mad for being wrenched out of space into our back yard.
Who's mad?
I'm not mad.
- Are you mad, Alpha?
- Not me.
Darrin, I just know they're friendly.
There's only one way to prove it.
I'm going to coax them out here.
- Sam, I wouldn't think of permitting - Don't worry, sweetheart.
If they show any signs of meanness, I'll just pop back to you.
- But, Sam - Worrywart.
Sam?
Sam, where are you?
- That's right.
Where is she?
- Here I am.
How?
How did she do that?
If they're that far advanced, we don't stand a chance.
Well, I'm glad you speak our language.
At least we won't have any communication problem.
My name is Samantha.
We're from the planet Parenthia.
And don't you dare come any closer.
Before we put our N-guns away, I'd like to know where we are and how we got here.
- Well, you are on the planet Earth.
And the way you got here Well, you see, my aunt is a witch.
- A what?
- No, stupid, not a "what," a "which".
Are you sure you don't mean a "who"?
It is a little complicated.
But the important thing is you want to go home, right?
Good.
Now, put away your guns.
These are only N-guns.
That's right.
N stands for "niceness".
It wouldn't hurt you.
It'd just make you friendly.
But I'm already friendly.
That's right, stupid.
She's on our side.
It's the one with the funny ears who's mean.
He's really a very nice fellow.
Look, why don't you two come into the house and I'll fix you a nice hot breakfast and we can learn more about each other.
- Well - Cross my heart, fellas.
I will not take you to my leader.
Okay, open up in there!
Darrin, I'd like you to meet our guests from the planet Parenthia.
Show them how friendly the natives can be, sweetheart.
Welcome to our planet, gentlemen.
Well, he certainly has changed his tune.
I think the atmosphere is all right for us.
My nose is still cold.
How can you just sit there?
You were right, Mrs. Kravitz.
There is something funny going on around here.
Our radar tracking shows that something streaked to Earth in this area.
And if my hunch is right, I'll be wearing oak leaves.
That figures.
This place is getting squirrelier by the minute.
Floppy ears.
My, my.
I thought spacemen had pointed ears.
She means like my cousin Rondo.
You remember?
The one that had the ear job.
So you say you descended from apes, eh?
Well, that's believable.
Sam, I'm gonna call the Air Force.
Sweetheart, he's right, relatively speaking.
I know, but it's the way he said it.
Alpha, don't be a snob.
After all, our ancestors walked on all fours too.
Would you like to see a picture of my family?
Oh, I'd love to.
- Is that your wife?
- Yes.
And those are the twins, Yip and Yap.
This is the first time I've been away.
She's going to be howling mad.
But you know, I kind of miss her whining.
Sweetheart, I keep thinking how I'd feel if we were separated.
I guess you're right, honey.
It wouldn't be fair to keep them here.
But what about?
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
Aunt Clara, wasn't Tabatha with you when you cast the spell?
Well, yes.
That's it.
Well, of course.
Why do you ask?
She might remember some of the words.
Come on.
Let's go upstairs.
What is it?
They never covered anything like this in Officer's Candidate School.
Let me take a look.
Okay, but wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that your planet Earth is 250 trillion miles from Parenthia?
Boy, you're really out in the boondocks, aren't you?
So that's what they've been up to.
Isn't there some kind of law against harbouring space people?
Wait till Uncle Charlie sees this.
He'll never be able to call me a ding-a-ling again.
Come on.
I've gotta use your phone.
You go.
I'm not budging from this spot.
All right.
But keep out of sight.
This is so exciting.
You fellas better wait in the ship.
That way you'll be ready.
Orvis, you wouldn't want to forget the syrup.
Thank you.
Pancakes without syrup is ridiculous.
Halt!
- I'm making a citizen's arrest.
- Mrs. Kravitz.
I knew there was something weird about your family.
You're an advanced unit from another planet.
Now, Mrs. Kravitz, you're just excited.
You're not gonna get away with it.
Captain Tugwell has contacted Colonel Burkett and the Air Force is on their way here right now.
And you'll be captured and put where you belong.
Boy, this one is really begging for a shot of niceness.
Hello, Mr. Stephens.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your adorable companions?
Why, certainly, Mrs. Kravitz.
This is Alpha and Orvis, some actor friends of ours.
They're with the Parenthian Players.
Well, they're just the cutest, most adorable loveable little angels I've ever met.
Tell me about yourself, precious.
I liked her better the other way.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to pick some flowers for my husband.
He's been so understanding.
Okay, boys, into the ship.
The Air Force is on its way.
Where are the spacemen?
Spacemen?
There aren't any spacemen.
Care for a flower?
Sweetheart, Tabatha remembered part of it.
"Night" and "sight".
Don't worry, boys.
It should be any minute now.
- Let's hope so.
I hate long goodbyes.
- Come on, dummy.
I don't want to rush you, Aunt Clara but I think those sirens are for us.
Yes, light, fright.
- No, night and sight.
Night and sight.
- Night and sight.
This better not be another false alarm.
Wait'll you see them.
They've got floppy ears.
They're in back.
Come on.
Shane, stick with the car radio, just in case, huh?
Springer, you go around the other way.
I'll give it one more chance.
Flying saucer from out the night All right.
Nobody move.
You're all my prisoners.
Return ye now and leave my sight Okay, Tugwell, where are your space people with the long, floppy ears?
Okay, Stephens, where did you hide the spacemen?
- Spacemen?
- What spacemen?
You saw them, Mrs. Kravitz.
The little men with the floppy ears, remember?
Oh, you mean those actors.
It's not very nice of you to make fun of them.
None of us is perfect, captain.
Here, colonel, have a tulip.
Tugwell, you're gonna love it in the infantry.
But, Uncle Charlie, Mom said that you were gonna Oh, Aunt Clara.
Oh, you were wonderful.
Oh, dear.
Thank you, darling.
Wasn't she wonderful, Darrin?
I don't know what's so wonderful about giving my ulcer an ulcer.
I don't think that's very nice.
After all, Aunt Clara got rid of the saucer for us, didn't she?
That's true.
She got rid of it, all right but let's not lose sight of the fact that it was Aunt Clara in the first place who - You were wonderful, Aunt Clara.
- Oh, thank you, Darrin.
Thank you, Darrin.
Oh, darling.
You know, something good could have come from this experience.
- What's that?
- If we had asked I bet they would have left one of their niceness guns.
Who knows?
It might even work on your mother.
Darrin.
Well
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
No, everything's just fine.
I was just wondering if you'd heard anything yet.
Honey, I told you I'd call you as soon as I found out.
Larry's in with McMann right now.
I'll let you know the second I get the news.
All right, sweetheart.
Now, but remember, no matter what happens, I love you.
And I love you.
Who is this?
That's Larry.
Bye.
Tabatha, eat some of your spinach.
Otherwise, you won't grow up to be a full partner, like Daddy.
- Partner.
- That's right.
And this very minute, he's getting the news from Larry.
L I can't believe it.
Neither did Omega National Bank and Trust.
"Assets over $100".
I don't understand.
How could seven zeros disappear?
You tell me.
Wait a minute.
Are you suggesting I'm responsible for this goof?
It's your letter, your project.
You were following through.
Who am I supposed to blame, the janitor?
But, Larry, I did follow through.
I checked the copy and I double-checked it.
I proofed it with my secretary.
What more could I do?
This is just a typo.
If this is a typo, Mount Vesuvius is a cigarette lighter.
Darrin, you pulled the greatest boo-boo of all time.
Well, are you just gonna stand there?
Haven't you got anything to say?
Does?
Does this mean I'm not going to be a partner?
Sweetheart, I know you feel awful, but it's not the end of the world.
You still have your job.
You don't?
Larry suggested it would be best if I took sick leave for the time being.
I said I wasn't sick.
He said I might be.
What does that mean to you?
Now, honey, you know Larry.
He always gets over those things.
Sam, this wasn't one of those things.
It was a disastrous error.
And I still can't figure out how it happened.
There's no human way that goof could've slipped by me.
I checked, I double-checked.
Wait a minute.
Let me say that again.
There was no human way that Of course!
Your mother.
She couldn't bear the idea that I was gonna make it.
She's the one that blew those seven extra zeros.
Now, Darrin.
There's no other explanation.
Well, you're being ridiculous.
Why would she do a thing like that?
Mother isn't Sam I have an announcement to make.
I give up.
I am tired of bucking all this witchcraft.
No matter how I try, someone in your family fouls things up.
So from now on, anything goes.
You and yours can practice all the witchcraft you want to.
- Oh, now, Darrin, don't say that.
- Prohibition has been repealed.
Darrin, I am not going to allow you to blame a human error on witchcraft.
What's so terrible about making a mistake?
It can happen to anybody.
Even a bank.
I'm going up and get into bed.
Darrin, you haven't even had your supper.
And I made your favourite dish.
Beef stew.
Look.
Uncle Arthur, what are you doing in there?
What do you think?
I'm a stewaway.
Oh, brother, just what I need.
Uncle Arthur, will you please get out of there?
That stew could use a pinch of time.
No danger of it boiling now.
It's a watched pot.
Oh, I'm too much.
I ran into Madam Medusa, otherwise known as your mother and she told me the good news about Darrin.
Congratulations, my boy.
Good night.
Sweetheart, what are you doing in bed?
You'll be late.
- For what?
- For work.
I'm not going to work.
What?
Darrin, this is ridiculous.
You've got to get up and go to work.
Why?
What's the use of trying to fight a one-sided battle against witchcraft?
It's like trying to put out the Chicago Fire with a bottle of pop.
Well, I can't believe my ears.
Now, Darrin, you get dressed and come down to breakfast.
No.
I'll fix you some waffles.
Okay.
Where are you going?
The last time I saw my waffle iron, it was in the kitchen.
But didn't you hear me?
The ban is lifted.
Why waffle when you can twitch?
Darrin, you may have given up, but I haven't.
I think that cooking on a stove is more fun than using witchcraft.
And I also enjoy taking care of my husband and my child in the everyday mortal way.
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here.
Now, for the last time, will you please get up.
Okay.
When you are ready to eat your words, your breakfast will be ready to eat.
Uncle Arthur, what are you doing here?
And what's this?
- What's it look like?
- A cow.
Very good, Sammy.
Uncle Arthur.
I'm just complying with the child's request.
She wanted more milk.
What's wrong with getting it from the refrigerator?
I never milked a refrigerator.
Really, Uncle Arthur.
The little darling's getting a big kick out of the cow.
When was the last time she laughed at a bottle of milk?
Anyway, I only came back to find out how Darrin's doing.
Terrible.
He thinks witchcraft is at the bottom of all his troubles and he won't even get up.
I don't know what to do.
- How about a hotbed?
- Hotbed?
Same as a hotfoot, only we do it to the whole bed.
Uncle Arthur, this is serious.
He's never been like this before.
That bad, huh?
Why don't I go up and cheer him up.
Please, he feels bad enough.
I resent that.
I'll have you know that beneath this clown's mask lies another clown's mask.
Don't worry, Sammy.
I'll have a little man-to-man talk with him and see if I can't get his confidence back.
Well, okay.
But remember, no you-know-what.
I will rely on nothing but my intellectual powers, okay?
Fine, but try and use your head too.
You see?
A poor joke is better than none.
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?
- Chester.
- Chester who?
Chester gigolo Everywhere I go Just what I need.
My boy, you may not believe this but I am here to help you.
- Do you really wanna help me?
- I do.
Go away.
I'm not gonna exchange insults with you because I don't want you to lose your amateur standing.
You have been unmercifully persecuted by that Madame Lafarge of the broomstick set.
Otherwise know as your mother-in-law.
And you have every right to cry foul.
Well, I am glad to hear someone agrees with me.
I not only agree with you, I am going to do something about it.
Here.
Take this and keep it.
- What is it?
- A lucky charm.
As long as you have it, no harm can befall you and that includes any kind of witchcraft.
What does it do, explode?
Okay, I deserve that.
But tell the truth wouldn't a charm like this come in handy around here?
It sure would, if I can believe you.
I'll prove it to you.
Get up.
All right.
Hold this and stand there.
- What?
What's that for?
- You'll see.
I don't want to alarm anyone.
That's the oldest trick in the bag.
You've got blanks in that gun.
Oh, really?
Well?
- Look, I appreciate your interest - Need more convincing, huh?
Okay.
Climb up.
This is ridiculous.
Don't fight me, boy.
I'm trying to save you.
Now get up there.
- Now jump.
- What?
You can't get hurt as long as you have that charm.
Jump.
- It really works, doesn't it?
- Of course.
Do you know what this means?
For the first time since my marriage, I'm immune.
They can't touch me.
I can't be hexed, zapped or twitched.
From now on, I'm on an even footing with every other human being.
I'm going back to the office and If you wanna stay on that even footing you better hang on to this fella.
We don't have to mention this to Samantha, do we?
Of course not.
It'll be just our little secret.
- He's really getting dressed?
- He'll be coming down any second.
That's wonderful.
Sweetheart, isn't that marvellous?
Daddy's coming down to have breakfast with you.
- Syrup?
- Gobs of it.
Sam, I'm leaving.
Sweetheart, what about breakfast?
No time for that.
I wanna get down to the office as soon as possible.
I'm gonna sit Larry Tate down and convince him I can save the Omega account.
Well, I'm glad to see you're back to normal but how did Uncle Arthur do it?
Oh, he gave me a new point of view.
Thanks, unc.
How'd you do it?
You heard him.
I gave him a new point of view.
How?
Sam, certain people have unique powers of persuasion.
And other people cannot seem to tell the truth.
Did you use witchcraft on Darrin?
Quite the reverse.
I just used psychology.
Psychology?
I gave him a lucky charm that protects him from witchcraft and all other harm.
What are you talking about?
There's no such thing.
Sure, but he doesn't know it.
And it got him out of bed, didn't it?
Gave him a new point of view.
And when I tell him he's been carrying around the top of this lamp he'll realize he got through the day on his own.
- Psychology.
- That's awful.
Why?
Well, for one thing, it's deceitful.
And he could get into terrible trouble.
You see the problem, Uncle Arthur.
He might not get through the day alive.
That is a problem.
Black isn't one of your best colours.
Maybe I'd better tell him the truth about the charm.
- No.
- No?
No.
It would just prove his point that witchcraft is responsible for his troubles.
Then, what do you suggest?
First, I don't think you should be here when he gets home.
That's a good suggestion.
Second, I am not gonna let him out of my sight all day.
Now, you stay here and mind Tabatha till I get back.
Goodbye, Uncle Arthur.
Thanks for your help.
She really knows how to hurt an uncle.
I'll level with you, Darrin.
I didn't expect to see you today.
Or tomorrow, or the next day.
Come on, Larry.
You know you weren't serious about my taking sick leave.
I wasn't?
Larry l've got a brilliant idea for getting Omega National back into the fold.
I thought you looked a little feverish.
Joke all you want, but you're gonna hear me out if I have to tie you down.
Uncle Arthur, you're supposed to be watching Tabatha.
Don't worry, I got Hagatha to take over.
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's a regular fireball.
Naturally.
Because he thinks he can't lose which only proves that my idea was genuinely foolish.
Larry, what I wanna do is go down to Omega's home office and convince old man Markham that the mistake we made was a lucky fluke.
That would be the trick of the year.
How?
Larry, what is the biggest complaint people have against banks?
Too impersonal, no heart, right?
But here is a bank that makes an historic goof and is willing to laugh at it.
They weren't laughing when I talked to them.
They will when I tell them about the free publicity we'll get by spreading the story.
And I mean put it on the newswires do a feature story about it, get it into the columns.
Spread the word all over the country that Omega National Bank has a sense of humour.
Darrin, you may have come up with one of the greatest space-grabbers of all time.
Do you really think so, Lar?
No.
But what have we got to lose?
The account's gone anyway.
And as for you, we'll just extend your sick leave.
That's the kind of fella that throws a drowning man both ends of the rope.
It's just Larry's way.
The hardest thing for him to give is in.
Good luck, boy.
I'm sorry, but Mr. Markham doesn't see anybody without an appointment.
He'll see me.
Just tell him it's Darrin Stephens of McMann & Tate.
All right, but Mr. Markham, a Mr. Darrin Stephens of McMann & Tate to see you.
He says as far as he's concerned, none of you exist.
- What a sorehead.
Excuse me.
- Now, just a minute Mr. Markham, I don't blame you one bit for being resentful.
But if you don't see me, you'll pass up the chance to make Omega National a household word.
Isn't he magnificent?
Just brimming over with enthusiasm.
Well, let's hope the other fella doesn't pull the stopper.
Thank you very much, sir.
And thank you very much, miss.
No, it looks like he's gonna get in.
- Hadn't we better follow?
- What for?
He's perfectly safe in there.
While we're waiting, what do you say we go over to one of the tellers.
I've got a great routine where I deposit a paper bag with 5000 pennies in it.
I don't think that's funny.
Well, of course not.
Not till the bag breaks.
That's ridiculous.
No.
No, it's just using common cents.
And if you go along with my plan I guarantee Omega National will be on everyone's lips.
It'll be known as "the bank with a heart".
Well, what do you think?
Get out.
Maybe we ought to go in there.
He sounds like he could use some help.
Mr. Markham, I appeal to you.
Please don't let your anger stand in the way of a creative judgment.
Think about it.
No, we're not here to give him that kind of help.
Got papers here for Mr. Markham's signature.
Well, I'll take them.
I'm supposed to hand them to him personally.
Just a minute.
If I had any doubt about severing relations with your outfit you've convinced me.
And as for your idea - Yes?
- I have a bank messenger here with some official papers.
- All right, send him in.
As for your idea, the stupidity of it is exceeded only by your colossal gall.
What are you waiting for?
I'm not going to leave till I get a definite answer.
"Tell cashier to bring 10,000 in small bills or you're dead".
- Just what is the meaning of this?
- This is the meaning.
Do like it says or I'll blast you.
And don't touch that floor alarm.
If you're smart, you won't budge.
Call the cashier and remember, small bills.
Mr. Markham, don't.
Are you bucking to be a dead hero?
No, I'm just trying to make you realize that right now, you are on television.
- Right?
- Oh, right.
Do you think I'm a jerk?
I cased this place for months.
All the TV cameras are out there.
That's very clever of you.
- Make that call!
- No.
Boy, you're really asking for it.
Now I'm giving you fair warning, buster.
Stay where you are!
Well, he's still in there.
He must be making progress.
I tell you, thanks to me, that boy's hot as a pistol.
Now, why don't you give me that gun before it gets you into trouble?
You better not come any closer.
You'll never get away with it, you know.
If you don't stop, you won't live to find out.
They'll catch up with you sooner or later.
They always do.
Stephens, for heaven's sake, he'll kill you.
Don't worry.
He can't.
- You'll thank me for this someday.
- Thanks.
Stephens, I don't know what to say.
What a magnificent display of courage.
I'm deeply grateful.
Does that mean you'll reconsider the matter of the contract with McMann & Tate?
Well, l Yes, certainly.
I'll consider reconsidering it.
Well, thank you very much, sir.
What about my idea to exploit that mistake?
I don't think that's worth reconsidering.
"'One of the most remarkable displays of courage I have ever witnessed' said R.H. Markham, president of Omega National.
The would-be robber was taken to the county-prison hospital suffering from nervous prostration".
Sweetheart, I'm awfully proud of you.
But you took a terrible risk.
Well, actually, I don't deserve much credit.
What do you mean?
Well, Sam, you Well, that bank robber just didn't have much confidence.
By the way, the print shop finally admitted they were the ones who dropped all those zeros.
Larry was so tickled about getting the account back he decided not to fire them.
Well, lucky for the printer.
It's even luckier that the printer is married to Larry's sister.
What about the promotion?
Larry suggested we cool that for a time.
You know, until everyone forgets that mistake about Omega's assets.
That could be forever.
That's the period of time Larry suggested.
- Honey.
- Sweetheart.
- What?
- Yes?
Darrin there's something that Uncle Arthur told me Honey, I was just about to mention that.
He told you about this, didn't he?
Yes.
So I'm not really a hero because that bank robber couldn't have hurt me.
Is that what he told you?
Well, there's a little bit more to it than that.
Why didn't he tell me himself?
Well, you see, he thought it would be easier Better, if I did it.
What is it?
I don't get it.
Well, Uncle Arthur was just trying to build your confidence.
- That isn't a lucky charm?
- Hardly.
And that bank robber was holding a gun on me and I And I - Well, I called it, didn't I?
- You did.
I'll get the smelling salts.
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
Congratulations, sweetheart.
Sam, how did you know?
Louise called me.
Why didn't you?
Well, I wanted to tell you myself.
I should have known there was something big going on when you told me I could get mother to babysit.
- Is she here yet?
- No, but she will be.
In the meantime, let's celebrate.
Honey, hold it.
Hold it.
It's not that big a deal.
I am not the Advertising Man of the Year.
I am just one of a number of Advertising Men of the Year named by the Huckster's Club.
That is an honour.
Like being named the Most Valuable Player or being invited to one of Truman Capote's parties.
Well, not that much of an honour but it did get us invited to a cocktail party that's being thrown by McMann & Tate in my honour.
Well, how about that.
So don't be so modest.
Sammy, it's really not that big of a deal.
Here's to Darrin Stephens, who has just won the humility trophy.
I did have a little celebration of my own planned.
Like going out to dinner and dancing at the Starlight Club.
I made reservations for 8:00.
I'd better go up and change.
- I'm very proud of you.
- Thank you.
- He's disgusting.
- Mother.
What a fantastic ego.
I thought he was being rather modest.
Behind that façade is the president of the Darwood Stephens Fan Club.
Mother, you have always claimed that Darrin was a nobody.
Now that he's being honoured by his peers, you cannot stand it.
A few compliments, people accepting dumbo's ideas, agreeing with him then you'd think everything he said was pure gold.
That may be true of some mortals but what you don't understand is Darrin is special.
Now, I'm gonna go upstairs and lay out his dinner jacket and you make yourself at home.
On the morrow, praise will heap High upon that mortal creep Then, my daughter, you will see Just how humble he can be From this day on, you will find Mortals bending to your mind You will have a glow of charm Extending twice your outstretched arm Mortals who in this circle be No matter what you say, agree Now, my boy, we'll see.
We'll see.
Good morning, Miss Willis.
Did you get that report out last night?
Yes, but I'm still hung up on your "good morning".
- What?
- Everyone says hello when they come in, and it doesn't mean much.
But when you say "good morning," it Well, it just lights up the office.
Well, thank you very much, Miss Willis.
All I said was, "good morning".
- Darrin?
- Yeah, Lar.
O.J. Slocum's in my office being impossible.
Well, would you like me to see what I can do with him?
Look, if the old smoothie here can't handle him, what could you do?
No, I just came in to rest a little between rounds.
On the other hand, why don't you give him a try.
- Whatever you say.
- Well, you do have a kind of something about you.
An air of confidence.
You know, maybe it's that hokey award you won.
I don't know though.
You know, Slocum can be a real bear.
He just might tear you to shreds.
Larry if you enjoy suffering, don't let me interfere with your fun.
No, maybe you're right.
You've got a kind of glow of success about you today.
All right, Darrin, sic him, huh?
Yeah.
Air of confidence?
Glow of success?
- Hello, Mr. Slocum.
- Goodbye, Stephens.
Trying to double-team me with one of your junior partners?
- No, of course not, O.J. - I don't deal with junior partners.
But tell me what you have in mind, Stephens.
Thank you, sir.
I'm a reasonable man, and I feel a warmth from you.
The right chemistry.
Now, let me have your thoughts.
Well, Mr. Slocum, I think that our job is to take your thoughts give them sales appeal, in our own way and extend that through all the advertising media.
Exactly.
I think he has a positive way of putting things.
I like that.
Yes, of course.
But what in a positive way were you referring to that he was putting?
Join the party, Tate.
He said, take my thoughts, give them sales appeal and extend them through all the advertising media.
Oh, yes!
I'm hip.
How about a little brainstorming?
Well, Mr. Slocum, this is a little short notice.
Come on now.
What do you think of when I say soup?
Wait a minute.
I may have something.
I like it, but it might be too obvious.
No, I have a feeling I'll like it too.
Go ahead.
I'm thinking of showing the big family that makes your soup.
The bean dumpers, chili shovelers, the salters, the pepperers the stirrers, the strainers, the canners, the labelers.
A group picture, you follow?
Yes, yes, I do.
Underneath, the caption might read: "We're nuts about our soup".
We're nuts about our soup.
It tastes good to me.
Well, maybe I got lucky.
Stephens, I want you to know that I'm nuts about your suggestion.
Best idea that's come out of McMann & Tate in years.
Thank you, sir.
Now I know why you were voted whatever it was.
"We're nuts about our soup"?
You know, on second thought Yes, sir?
On second thought, I like it even better.
I want you to take personal charge of this campaign, Stephens.
All right, sir.
How about that?
I don't think that was such a great idea.
It's not that bad.
Wait a minute.
Say it again.
We're nuts about our soup.
It's got a ring to it.
- Yes?
- It's Mr. McMann calling.
My weekly get-on-the-ball call.
Will you excuse me?
I'd better take it alone.
Put him on.
He wants to speak to Mr. Stephens.
Yes, sir?
Of course.
Tomorrow morning?
My pleasure, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Well, back to the old drawing board.
- Darrin?
- Yeah, Larry.
What was that all about?
Mr. McMann wants to see me on his yacht tomorrow morning.
But he's my partner.
What does he want to see you for?
I guess he wants to congratulate me on being one of the Advertising Men of the Year.
Well, he can do that tomorrow night at the cocktail party.
I don't know of any other reason why.
I do.
He'll do anything to bug me.
You know, it's funny.
You make one little breakthrough and suddenly they all recognize you for what you really are.
What's that?
Well, you know what you were saying about me this morning.
They recognize you for a sweet and loving husband?
No.
You know how you always tell me l'm smart and talented and creative And modest.
Honey, I can't help it.
Did I tell you about O.J. Slocum?
Twice, but who's counting?
Larry thought I'd be eaten up alive, but no.
Right off the top of my head, I had it.
We're nuts about our soup.
- "We're nuts about our soup"?
- Slocum was stunned.
So am I. Well, honey, I don't say it's the greatest phrase in the world.
But it's got something.
It's got It's got Mediocrity?
Well, sweetheart, it really isn't that - Everybody loved it.
- Now, don't get grumpy.
What do I know about the advertising business.
Yeah.
Anyway in the afternoon, I practically sewed up a new candy account.
It was one of those great days when everybody was going along with me and I have a feeling it's going to keep on going that way.
Bravo.
Tomorrow I see Mr. McMann on his yacht and from then on, it's going to be up, up.
Good, good.
Who knows where it'll end.
Maybe someday I'll become president.
- Of McMann & Tate?
- No.
President.
Thank you.
Well, Stephens, glad to have you aboard.
Glad to be aboard, sir.
Would you like a cup of my special coffee?
Thank you, sir.
- Pour, Gregory.
- Yes, sir.
Let me congratulate you on being one of the Advertising Men of the Year.
And I might add that you reek of the magnetic personality that goes into the making of great men.
That's especially complimentary coming from you, Mr. McMann.
Did you know that I was the first Advertising Man of the Year 25 years ago?
- No, that's quite an honour, sir.
Not really.
I started the thing and elected myself.
That's very good.
What's in this?
How do you like it?
- It's delightful.
- Four parts rum and one part coffee.
Coffee does wonderful things to rum.
- Sit down.
- Thank you, sir.
It's a funny thing.
You know, I I asked you over here to give you an ordinary congratulations.
Meeting you again, I see that it's a great deal more than that.
You are the crown prince of McMann & Tate.
That's very flattering, Mr. McMann, but Now, now, none of that modesty.
It doesn't fit in at all with the high-voltage personality that's coming across to me.
I always wondered who was behind McMann & Tate.
- Now I know.
- Aren't you forgetting Larry Tate?
I've tried, but I've never been able to.
Larry's got a lot of good qualities.
He's hard working he's not impressed by facts, he's slippery he lies beautifully, and he's got a nice head of hair.
But he's had it.
Frankly, deep down, he's shallow.
With all due respect, sir, I disagree.
I know Larry pretty well and Now, I know that you're loyal, Darrin but it's time Larry turned over his surfboard to you and let a younger man ride the wave of the future.
Remember, Larry gets a cut on every account you bring in.
- That's true.
- Actually, you'll be doing him a favour.
It's a nice way of looking at it.
Well, there's always a nice way of looking at things.
Well, I'm going to start on Project Stephens.
And don't you worry about Larry.
He'll be in line for a big bonus.
I'm just happy to find a man that has what I like to call rememberability.
That's the human version of product identification.
Thank you very much, sir.
I do have a lot of ideas I'd like to carry out.
I wanna see McMann & Tate ready for the future.
That's the way I like to hear you talking.
I like the way you said that.
Well, I'll be seeing you at the party tonight for our Advertising Man of the Year.
Sir.
Well, there goes an impressive young man, Gregory.
- I thought so too, sir.
- Yeah.
But for the life of me, I don't know why I'm impressed.
I hope that's a good sign.
Hello?
Hi, sweetheart.
How did the meeting go with Mr. McMann?
I bowled him over.
I dazed him.
Sam, he said I'm going to be the crown prince of McMann & Tate.
Terrific.
That makes me a princess.
I'll wear a tiara tonight.
I'm not kidding, Sam.
I'm on my way to the top.
McMann realized I've got it.
And you thought I was overreacting, didn't you?
Well, I was beginning to suspect something.
What about Larry?
He's going to come off just fine.
Look, I'll be home early to change for the party.
Yes, Your Excellency.
Mother.
Mother!
Mother, I know you're up to something.
You're a wicked witch.
Yes, Mrs. Stephens, you're gonna be very proud of friend hubby.
Impact, that's what he's got.
Impact.
Is that what it is?
I thought it was sex appeal.
Well, that I'm not willing to judge.
You don't drink, Mr. McMann?
Well, only coffee.
Hello, McMann.
Mrs. Stephens, this is Charles Gilbert the head of the Hercules Tractor Company.
- How do you do.
- How do you do.
And Darrin Stephens, our young executive who's been voted one of this year's you-know-whats.
How do you do, sir.
Why, I'm happy to know you, Mr. Stephens.
I wish you'd sit in on our next conference.
Well, things are kind of piling up on me and He's just full of ideas.
I really don't have the time.
You see, Mr. Stephens, we sell our tractors to the man who has made America great.
The common man.
And right now, you're coming across to me as the man who could speak his language.
Hercules Tractor, huh?
Lmpact, that's what he's got.
I see a picture.
A picture of a tractor pulling a stump.
The caption reads It reads: "Let Herc give it a jerk".
- It's great.
- I love it.
"Let Herc give it a jerk"?
It's amazing.
Right off the top of his head.
It's a very fertile area.
They loved it.
Yes, but, sweetheart, it really isn't that good.
If McMann, Gilbert and I think it's good, it's good.
Right.
Darrin.
Samantha.
This is Mr. Angel, who makes that wonderful brew, Angel Coffee.
- Samantha and Darrin Stephens.
- How do you do.
How do you do, sir.
You're that fellow, aren't you?
Okay, Stephens, do it.
- Do what?
- Lf you're that good give me an idea for our new campaign.
More coffee, and don't put so much coffee in it this time.
Doesn't he get a chance to think about it a little first?
I'm thinking about it now.
How about, "The good, good morning flavour that makes getting out of bed worthwhile".
- Marvellous!
That's it.
- Oh, yeah!
Fantastic.
You have a higher duty than McMann & Tate.
Our government needs men like you.
Have you ever thought of running for congressman or senator?
No, but he's thought of running for president.
That's what I wanted to hear.
I'd like you to lead a middle-of-the-road party.
I'll back you.
Think about it, Mr. Stephens.
Think about it.
- Sam, did you hear that?
- With both ears.
Of course it's ridiculous.
I'm not ready for that yet.
What do you think?
I think we should go while we can still get your head through the door.
I should think that you would be happy that other people are beginning to appreciate my special talent.
But no!
Mother!
Why don't you sit down and plan who's going to be in your cabinet.
I have a few questions I wanna ask Mother.
Darling, I'm sorry, but I must leave immediately.
My club is having a costume party, and I'm going as Twiggy.
Not yet.
I figured it out.
You didn't put a spell on Darrin, you put one around him, didn't you?
A spell?
Does that mean I'm not really one of the Advertising Men of the Year?
No, no, of course not.
Mother cast a spell that affects all mortals around you.
They are overwhelmed by anything you say.
Then I don't have impact and rememberability and all that?
And you said it wouldn't go to his head.
Mother was right, wasn't she?
No.
Now, you remove that spell this instant.
- But dum-dum loves it.
- I do not!
Well Edgeful, eyeful, trifle, tree This removes the spell round thee Thank you.
I thought I had some good ideas tonight.
Sweetheart, how often have you had really good ideas right off the top of your head?
Not very often.
They were always the result of a lot of hard work.
- Nothing worthwhile comes that easily.
- Yeah.
Yeah, you're right.
It'll probably take all night, but why don't you go into the study and come up with some good ideas to sell those clients tomorrow.
Good night, Mr. President.
No.
No, I'm sorry, gentlemen.
There's something I like about: "That good, good morning flavour that makes getting out of bed worthwhile".
I don't know why I like it, but it impresses me.
Maybe I just impressed you.
No, I'm not particularly impressed by you.
I'm not either.
Excuse me, I'll be back in a moment.
Hello?
Hi, sweetheart.
How are the new ideas going?
They still like the bad ones.
I can't sell them the good stuff.
Honey, can?
Can you put that you-know-what back on you-know-who just temporarily?
Well Well, okay.
Is that it?
That's it.
Goodbye, honey.
Believe me, Mr. Angel, I can't explain why Darrin's gone sour on these ideas.
But, well, sometimes it happens to creative people.
Darrin, Mr. Angel and I agree that you've completely lost your judgment.
Mr. Angel l'm going to tell you this new idea just once more and I want you to listen as if you were hearing it for the first time.
Nothing can make me listen to that again.
Oh, no?
Except a man like you.
Go ahead.
I see a cloud.
On the cloud are a couple of angels drinking Angel Coffee.
- Yes, yes.
I like it.
- From their expressions you can see the coffee is sublime.
I like it very much.
Underneath it says, " By special permission, this heavenly brew is now available to deserving people on Earth".
The greatest.
I don't know why I didn't see that before.
Well, I've heard all I have to hear.
Carry on, gentlemen.
Well, goodbye, Mr. Angel.
We'll keep in touch.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, sir.
- That was great, Darrin.
- Thanks, Lar.
Send the next customer in.
We're rolling, Larry.
- Are you through with the spell now?
- Throw it away.
We talked six different clients out of bad ideas and into good ideas.
And I talked Mr. Ramser into finding another presidential candidate.
Good.
I only wanna be your first lady.
Even without a spell, I do have a little witchcraft of my own and a talent for persuading people.
After all, I persuaded you to marry me, didn't I?
That you did.
That alone is enough to make me Advertising Man of the Year.
I my opinion, you are Man of the Century.
But don't let it go to your head.
That went to my head.
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
Sam, I'm exhausted.
Turn out the lights and come to bed.
Right this minute, sweetheart.
As soon as I open the window for some fresh air.
Sweetheart, come here and look.
Come here and look at what?
Mrs. Kravitz is outside in her nightclothes trying to hitchhike.
Come to bed.
Doesn't that strike you as unusual?
Not for Mrs. Kravitz.
Besides, you shouldn't get involved.
Oh, sweetheart, please.
Look at her waiting out there.
She looks so forlorn.
Sweetheart, she's our neighbour.
The least we can do is find out what her problem is, isn't it?
- No.
- Why not?
I've learned from experience when you set out to do the least you can do, you wind up doing the most.
You wanna give me that once more?
And try it in English.
In two words: Butt out.
Sweetheart, you're a cruel heart.
Mrs. Kravitz?
Mrs. Kravitz I don't mean to be a busybody, but what are you doing?
I'm doing something I've always wanted to do.
I'm deserting my husband.
Just like that?
In the middle of the night?
Yep.
After 22 years of marriage, I've had it.
- Where are you going?
- Tonight, to a hotel.
Tomorrow, to Mexico for a quickie divorce.
I wanted to phone for a taxi, but Abner wouldn't let me.
Because he loves you and needs you.
Because it's a toll call.
Sam, come on inside.
You'll catch pneumonia.
Mrs. Kravitz, wouldn't it be simpler if you spent the night in our guest room?
Gee, I don't know.
Strange things seem to happen over there.
Well, you can always look at it as any port in a storm.
Yeah, that's true.
Okay.
Thanks.
Sweetheart, Mrs. Kravitz is going to spend the night with us.
Wonderful.
- More coffee, sweetheart?
- Thank you, honey.
Is Grandma Endora coming?
Not that I know of.
Our company is our neighbour, Mrs. Kravitz.
How long is she gonna be our company?
Until after breakfast.
Just until after breakfast.
Good morning.
Good morning, Mrs. Kravitz.
Hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
Good morning, sweetheart.
Mrs. Kravitz, did you lie awake all night tossing and turning?
I should say not.
I slept like a top.
Not listening to Abner snore was a refreshing change of pace.
- Orange juice?
- Yes, don't you like it?
Well, I generally start with a tall glass of wheat-germ oil.
Sorry, we don't carry it.
Proper nutrition is the key to vitality.
- Of course.
- The human body can take just so much abuse.
Each of us owes it to his system to nourish it as nature intended.
I've told that to Abner every morning of our married life.
I say, "Abner, you're not trying to maintain a garbage dump.
You are trying to maintain a human body".
I say, "One of these days, that body will strike back at you".
And do you know what he does?
- What does he do?
- He hides behind his newspaper as if I was a nag.
Time to go to work.
Bye, honey.
Goodbye, little honey.
Goodbye, Daddy.
Goodbye, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Have a nice flight.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
- Darrin, Darrin.
- Sam, I know I didn't finish my breakfast, but I just had to get out of there.
You could have thought of a better exit line than: - "Goodbye.
Have a nice flight".
- What's wrong with that?
- That's inviting her to leave.
- That's just what I had in mind.
Do you want her to leave her husband?
I want her to leave our house.
If she wants to leave her husband, that's her business.
But she doesn't want to leave her husband.
I'll bet that deep down, they're very much in love.
It's merely a matter of bringing them to their senses.
Fine, you do that.
All I ask is that you do it before I get home tonight.
Hello, Abner?
This is Gladys.
Gladys Kravitz soon to assume my maiden name of Gruber.
I'm across the street at Mr. And Mrs. Stephens'.
At 5:00 this afternoon.
I just called to tell you that I want the house the car and the bank account.
You can keep the mining stock.
Well, you never know when they might find something.
And if they find something, I want that too.
Yes, that's all I've got to say.
What have you got to say?
Well, as they say in Mexico, adiós.
Did he plead with you to come back?
No.
He said, "Happy landing".
Well, at least that's a start.
Hi, Mr. Kravitz.
- What's new?
- Not much, Mr. Stephens.
- What's new with you?
- I hate to think.
Sam?
Sam?
Hi there, sweetheart.
How are you?
Hungry.
What's for dinner?
Alfalfa soup organic vegetable loaf and kumquat pudding.
Does that menu mean what I think it means?
- What's that?
- That Mrs. Kravitz is still our houseguest.
That's what I thought you meant you thought it meant.
Oh, yes, yes, she's still here.
And to show her gratitude for our hospitality she surprised me by cooking dinner.
Well, I'll surprise her by taking my wife and daughter out for pizza.
- Get your coat.
- Oh, honey, you can't do that.
- It'll hurt her feelings.
- Better her feelings than my stomach.
Why didn't she go to Mexico?
I I talked her out of it.
Congratulations.
Well, honey, we were just giving Mr. Kravitz time to get lonesome.
I just saw Mr. Kravitz mowing his lawn.
He didn't look lonesome to me.
Well, just wait.
Just wait.
- He'll weaken tonight.
- And if he doesn't?
- We'll go over and weaken him?
- You'll go over and weaken him.
I'm staying neutral.
Well, how did you enjoy your dinner, Mr. Stephens?
Oh, it It was highly original.
Well, I tried to strike a perfect balance between proteins and minerals.
And you succeeded admirably.
I find that organic vegetable loaf and kumquat pudding are very compatible.
Samantha, aren't you supposed to visit one of our neighbours?
- What?
- One of our neighbours.
Oh, yes, of course.
I promised Mrs. Rich that I'd run over and look at her new dining room table.
I'll be back in a minute.
I regard the human body as a furnace.
And I regard food as what we stoke it with.
Okay, you've got the big action.
What are you holding?
I'm not holding anything.
I've got them.
Whoever heard of getting a straight like that?
- I never seen anything like it.
- Who could that be?
- Hi.
- Good evening, Mr. Kravitz.
I came to talk to you Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be alone and lonely.
May I present my poker-playing associates.
Charlie, Fred, Al and Dave.
- How do you do?
- I'm pleased to be enchanted.
Hello, blondie.
You're just what this party needs.
A little female pulchritude.
- How do you do?
- Yes.
Hey, Abner, you devil, you.
Hey, listen, she's a lot cuter than Gladys.
Yeah, you're cuter than Gladys.
I didn't come here to play poker.
I came to reunite you with the woman you love.
You're wasting your time.
Sophia Loren doesn't want him.
Gentlemen, in my opinion, the disintegration of a marriage is no laughing matter.
All right, men.
Hold the laughter.
Mr. Kravitz, do you honestly believe that after 22 years you can get along without your wife?
- I'm not sure but I plan to give it a tremendous effort.
You'll fail.
Look at this room.
In one day, look what a mess it is.
- I know.
Not a health food in sight.
- Well, that's true.
- Just cold cuts and beer.
- Oh, may I fix your loveliness a pastrami sandwich?
No, thank you.
Mr. Kravitz, I'm very disappointed in you.
Why?
I'm winning.
You're hopeless.
Good night.
- Good night.
- The beauty parade is over.
- All right, let's gear them up.
- What?
You call the game.
Well, did you weaken him?
Not exactly.
Well, you'd better do something fast because if your houseguest doesn't get out of here soon your husband will.
- Oh, I'm glad you're back.
I made us a special treat.
What are they?
Organic meatballs?
They're soybean brownies.
Oh, goody.
Daddy, is Mrs. Kravitz still our company?
Yes, dear.
Mrs. Kravitz is still our company.
Good morning.
I'm taking my Saturday morning facial.
Is that wheat-germ oil?
Yes.
- Eat your breakfast, Tabatha.
- I'm all finished.
Well, then, all right, sweetheart.
You run on out and play.
I'll drink this in two minutes, after my skin loosens.
When did you get the wheat-germ oil?
- Yesterday.
Do you want some?
- No, thanks.
How much did you buy, enough to last for six months?
Oh, now, sweetheart, don't be sarcastic.
I have decided that Mrs. Kravitz is going back to her husband today.
- You've decided?
- Yeah, because somehow I get the idea that she's beginning to bug you.
Somehow, I'm glad you noticed.
Of course, to solve the problem, I'll have to use a little Witchcraft?
It would be expedient.
Sam, why is it that all of your goofs have to be solved by witchcraft?
What's wrong with a little ingenuity, a little mortal logic?
I'd even settle for a little female sneakiness.
All those things take time.
I don't care.
The rule of this household is that voodoo is forbidden.
This is my mud pack.
It opens up my pores.
And she is the exception that makes that rule a rule.
You're saying that now it's all right for me to use voodoo?
- Sam, we're desperate.
- Okay.
- What are you gonna do?
- I thought I'd try the old jealousy approach.
To make her jealous of him, or him jealous of her?
Him of her, so that he'd come and beg her for another chance.
I see.
Have you selected your poor innocent victim yet?
Mr. Leon Hogersdorf.
Your friendly neighbourhood butcher.
Mrs. Kravitz once told me she thought he looked like Henry Fonda.
So I'll make him "fond-a" Mrs. Kravitz.
Do you have to go to the butcher shop?
No.
No, no, I can do it long-distance.
Leon Hogersdorf Forget your habits Find your dream girl In Gladys Kravitz Oh, Mr. Hogersdorf, add 2 pounds of hamburger.
That's six nice lamb chops and 2 pounds Harry, will you take Mrs. Kelly's order?
I have to leave.
Did it work?
I hope so.
- How fast will he get here?
- As fast as he can drive.
Well, here he is.
I thought you said he looked like Henry Fonda.
I said Mrs. Kravitz thought he looked like Henry Fonda.
Up until yesterday, she thought Abner looked like Cary Grant.
Say, I wonder who that could be.
Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, Mr. Hogersdorf.
What a pleasant surprise.
Is Mrs. Kravitz here?
As a matter of fact, she is.
For some strange reason, I just have to see her.
Mrs. Kravitz, look who's here.
Since when do you deliver?
I don't.
I mean, I don't deliver meat, but I do deliver flowers.
They're beautiful.
- What are they?
- I don't know.
The florist didn't tell me.
When did I go to the florist?
Mr. Hogersdorf, you remember my husband, don't you?
- Oh, sure.
Nice to see you.
- Likewise.
My butcher who looks like Henry Fonda brought me flowers.
I see.
- How come?
- Because I Because l That's a good question.
Because I heard you and your husband have separated and I hoped flowers might soothe the difficult period of transition.
Why am I talking so formal?
I don't know, but I like the way it sounds.
I also had the selfish motive of wanting to be first in line.
First in line for what?
For when you are ready to begin dating other men.
My butcher wants to date me.
I heard.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll put these in my boudoir.
- Is it hot in here?
- No, I don't think so.
Oh, I must be coming down with Asiatic flu.
Doing great, honey.
But how does this make Mr. Kravitz jealous if he isn't here?
- Oh, he'll be here.
- Mr. Hogersdorf, are you all right?
- I don't think so.
Excuse me.
May I please have a six-pack of cold beer?
I beg your pardon?
That's funny, I thought I was going to the liquor store.
Him too?
Well, as long as you're here, come on in.
- Hello, Gladys.
- You're too late.
Mr. Abner Kravitz, have you met Mr. Leon Hogersdorf?
Sure.
I've spent many happy hours haggling with him.
Kravitz, you might as well know now, I'm madly in love with your wife.
- Who said that?
- You did.
You must be kidding.
I've been in love with her since the first day she walked into my shop asking if my chickens were healthy.
- How come you never told me?
- I knew you were married.
- She still is.
Come on, Mr. Kravitz, stand up for your rights.
- Who, me?
- Say that Mrs. Kravitz belongs to you.
She always has and she always will.
Well, wait a minute.
Let's not be hasty.
Mr. Kravitz, aren't you jealous?
Yes.
But I'll get over it.
I bear no hard feelings for your total ingratitude.
My ingratitude?
For what?
For all that I've done for you, for the 22 years of sacrifice.
You talk about sacrifice?
You don't know what sacrifice is.
Why do you think I put up my hair in curlers and do beauty angles and take facials and do exercises?
Because you like to torment me.
Wrong.
To make myself attractive to you.
Oh, I admit I might be fighting a losing battle, but at least I try.
Just like I try to take care of you.
I regard the human body as a furnace, and I regard the food that you put in Mrs. Kravitz, aren't you digressing?
Isn't the point you're making that your motive is love?
Yes.
At least, it used to be.
Still is, isn't it?
Is it, Gladys?
Why?
What difference would it make?
I'll show you after you tell me.
Is your motive still love?
Yes.
It's combined with a little hatred but yes.
Okay, fella, get out of here before my wife and I decide to buy our chickens elsewhere.
I hope you get over me.
Shall we go home, my darling?
Anything you say, honeybunch.
I'll pick up my things later.
Bye-bye, Mrs. Kravitz, Mr. Kravitz.
- Bye.
- Bye.
Nice going.
For a while, I thought you struck out.
So did I. Because the only spell I put on Mr. Kravitz was to get him to come over here.
Then everything he and Mrs. Kravitz said was unassisted?
- Straight from their hearts.
- You know what that proves?
- What?
It proves that the only thing stronger than witchcraft is love.
- I know.
I know.
I'd stake my marriage on it.
