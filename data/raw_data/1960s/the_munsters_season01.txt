{START OF EPISODE 01}
Uh, Tom?
Before we say good night, wouldn't you like to come in for a minute?
Mm-hmm!
And meet my folks.
Oh, you always bring that up.
Why do I have to meet your folks?
Well, I've been out with you a lot, and my aunt and uncle would like to meet you.
And your family.
Mm.
They're sort of old-fashioned.
Well, I'll tell you what.
My parents are having that party that you're coming to next week, so why don't I get them to invite your, uh  Uh Aah!
Aah!
Oh!
It is your aunt and uncle, isn't it?
Yes.
Are you all right?
It is your aunt and uncle?
Yes, I've lived with them since I was a baby.
Oh.
Well, come here, baby.
Mm!
They're standing real close, Lily.
Uh, you know, this is the fourth date she's had with that young man.
Oh, yes.
It's amazing how some boys will overlook a girl's appearance.
Sh-sh-sh-sh!
Uh, have a good time, Marilyn?
Uh-huh.
And guess what?
Tom's parents are giving a party next week, and I think you're both going to be invited.
Well!
I think it's high time we met this young man's parents.
You can't be too careful these days.
There are a lot of strange people in this world.
Hmm.
A party.
Sounds wonderful.
You know, we don't get out at night as much as we used to.
Well, I'm going up to bed.
See you in the morning.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
By the way, Tom says it's going to be a masquerade party.
Well, I suppose we'll just have to go, for Marilyn's sake.
But I wish it weren't a masquerade.
I know what you mean.
If there's anything that disturbs me, Lily, it's the idea of grown people like us dressing up in costume and looking ridiculous.
Tom, dear, your father and I will be happy to invite your little girlfriend to the masquerade party, but really now now, now the whole family.
I mean, just who are the Munsters?
Mother, they are simply her aunt and uncle.
And if they're anything like Marilyn, I'm sure they're lovely, charming people.
All right, but I do so hope the society columns won't misspell the Munsters' name on the guest list.
I'd hate to have my friends read that we'd entertained a couple of Monsters.
Oh, Dad.
Thanks very much for putting in a word with Mom.
If we invite Marilyn's folks, well  It'll really help me out with her.
You know how it is.
Son, I haven't known how it is for years.
If the Dalys are anything like their handwriting, they must fall over backwards a lot.
This party'll give us a chance to look over the boy's parents.
We wouldn't want Marilyn marrying into the wrong sort of family.
I've never heard of these Dalys, and after all, we Munsters are a very old family.
You're right, dear.
It's not as if someone just dug us up yesterday.
Look!
They didn't invite me?
Why, I've never been so insulted since the day I died.
Hmm.
And besides, as Marilyn's grandfather, I should be there!
But, Grandpa, we don't even know Mr. And Mrs. Daly.
We can't just take you along.
If I don't get to go, I'll use my magic powers.
I'll turn myself into chopped liver and show up in the hors d'oeuvres.
Now, Grandpa, will you calm down?
I won't!
I won't!
I won't.
!
If I don't get to go, I'll sit here and hold my breath till the color comes back in my cheeks.
You're being a big, spoiled baby.
Well, I suppose I could ask the Dalys to invite him.
It's better than having him come as chopped liver.
Thank you.
Of course, Mrs. Munster.
Mr. Daly and I will be happy to have dear Grandpapa.
Not at all, Mrs. Munster.
You're quite welcome.
Albert, I'm afraid those Munsters are frightful pushers.
Mrs. Munster just wheedled an invitation for some old grandpapa they've got kicking around the house.
- You couldn't put her off?
- How could I?
She gave me this sob story.
Said when someone's been living with you for hundreds of years, he's just like one of the family.
Now what on earth could she have meant by that?
You must have misunderstood her, dear.
The way things are going, the only worse thing that could happen would be if it rained on the night of our party.
Boy, look at the neat lightning.
I sure hope it hits our house.
Eddie, how do you like me as Priscilla?
Corny.
Why don't you dress up as a lady gorilla or something pretty like that?
I don't think even that would help me.
If you're going to a masquerade party, who am I gonna have for a babysitter?
Mrs. Morton, the mother of one of my girlfriends.
She's a very nice lady who just loves little boys.
Yuck.
Hey, Dad!
Uncle Herman, you make a simply wonderful King Arthur.
Daddy?
Are you in there?
Hello, "dere".
What's Aunt Lily coming as?
Uh, she hasn't let me see her costume.
She's being coy.
Yoo-hoo.
- Lily?
- Guess who?
- Who?
- Little Bo Peep.
Lily!
Uh, uh, you scared me out of a century's growth.
- How do I look?
- Positively awful.
Thank you.
It's amazing what they can do with makeup.
Eddie, don't forget to give Spotty his supper, and then go on up to bed.
Oh, and don't forget to wash behind your points.
Okay, if I have to.
Good night, everybody.
Good night.
Good night, Eddie.
Good night, Eddie.
At the sound of the tone, the time is 8:09.
Nevermore.
Nevermore.
Why don't you pipe down?
Pipe down!
That must be Tom.
Hello, Priscilla.
Hi, John Alden.
Where's your raincoat?
Why, it's the most beautiful weather all over town.
It's only raining in this block.
Crazy!
Tom, I want you to come in and meet my aunt and uncle.
Tom, this is my Aunt Lily.
How do you do?
How do you do?
It's a It's a great pleasure.
This is, uh It's uh, uh, uh, quite a house you have here.
Why, there's a fine old relic.
-  - Tom, my uncle's in there!
Oh, the masquerade!
I'm I'm terribly sorry, sir.
L Gadzooks, that smarts.
Well, we'll see you all at the masquerade.
You're going to love my parents.
They're a They're a gas.
We're certainly looking forward to meeting your parents, Thomas.
Now, you children have fun.
Oh, don't worry about us.
I'm I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Oh, uh, quite all right.
Quite all right.
Nice to have bumped into you.
Grandpa?
Hurry it up!
I'll be there in a minute!
I'm still working on my costume!
Let me see.
Jack the Ripper, Fairy Godmother, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde Mr. Hyde!
Mr. Hyde!
Ooh, that's quick, sure-fire, and got Frederic March his first Academy Award.
?
?
?
?
Cheers.
Ahh!
Well, come on already.
You know, I don't have all day!
Nothin'!
It's still me.
Oh, boy!
Somebody up there's been cuttin' this stuff again.
Herman?
No matter what these Dalys are like tonight, I want you to remember to be gracious and polite.
Don't worry, dear.
In spite of this silly costume, I'll be my own charming, natural self.
I'm every inch a gentleman.
In fact, several gentlemen.
Ooh.
Ooh!
You feel so nice and cold.
Albert, the guests will be arriving soon.
Are you ready?
Just a second, dear.
And, Albert, for Tom's sake, no matter what you think of those Munster people, I don't want you doing or saying anything to offend them.
You know me better than that, dear.
Our little boy, Eddie, is playing in his room, Mrs. Morton.
I'm sure he won't give you any trouble.
Of course he won't.
I've been a babysitter for 20 years, and there's nothing in the world that can faze me.
Why, Grandpa.
You really look like Napoleon.
Oh, it was easy.
I just combined the bottles marked Charles Boyer, General de Gaulle, and Marlon Brando.
Come on, Lily.
We'd better get going.
Oh, Mrs. Morton.
This is my husband, Mr. Munster.
- Oh, how do you do?
- How do you do?
Oh, yes, and this is my father, the Count.
My pleasure!
Grandpa!
Grandpa?
L-I think it's stopped raining.
Well, let's try not to let it spoil our evening!
Well, good night, Mrs. Morton.
Make yourself at home.
Oh!
And if Eddie's pet, Spotty, comes scratching at the back door, don't let him in.
Last time he ate the sofa.
Sofa.
Now, Grandpa, I want you to behave yourself tonight.
Don't get silly after two drinks and start telling those shaggy wolf stories of yours.
We want to make a good impression, so let's keep the Munster dignity.
Oh, don't worry.
You can count on me to be in a very dignified vein.
Hello!
I'm Mrs. Daly.
Juliet for tonight.
Uh, how do you do?
We're the Munsters.
So nice of you to invite us.
And this must be Grandpapa!
Knock it off.
My!
Aren't you a sweet little kitty?
Hello?
This is Eddie, calling babysitter.
Can you read me?
Yes, Eddie.
What is it?
Request permission to skip bath tonight.
Over.
Skip your bath?
Well, why would you want to do that, Eddie?
We're all out of scalding water.
Oh.
Well, l-I guess so.
You better get ready for bed now.
I'll be up soon to say good night.
Roger Wilco.
Over and out.
?
?
?
?
-  -  Nevermore, you cat fink.
?
?
Herman.
Herman.
Please.
Allow me.
Oh.
Thank you.
Grandpa!
Would you do me a big favor?
Anything, my dear.
Please dance with Mrs. Daly.
Dance with her?
Over my dead body!
For me?
Ah, Mrs. Daly.
You make a lovely Juliet.
Oh!
You remind me of one of my wives.
Really?
I had 167 of them.
Oh!
But of course, they're all dead now.
Oh, you must miss them!
Oh, no!
I visit them very often!
You must excuse me.
Mother, what's the matter?
I don't know why I let you talk me into inviting those horrible people!
The Munsters are bad enough, but don't give that grandfather of theirs anything more to drink!
He's positively snockered!
Well, Little Bo Peep, I must say, you're light on your feet.
As if you were dancing on air.
Funny you should say that.
Uncle Herman?
Have you met Tom's father yet?
Uh, no.
It's his duty as a host to introduce himself to me.
Oh, don't stand on formality!
Go over and say hello.
Be friendly.
Well Come on.
All right.
Uh, excuse me.
Oh!
Oh, hello.
I don't believe we've met.
- I'm Albert Daly.
This is Miss Hansen.
- How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm Herman Munster.
Uh, I can't quite place you, Mr. Daly, but you remind me of someone I know.
Oh, really?
But it's a shame, Mr. Daly, you couldn't get a costume for your own masquerade party.
Wha'?
What is it?
What's the matter, dear?
Agnes, that big, stupid King Arthur, he just insulted me.
I don't care if Tom does have a crush on their niece.
Those Munsters are the rudest people I ever met.
Eddie?
Eddie?
It's only me, Mrs. Morton.
I always do that when the moon comes up.
Oh!
Here, Spot.
Here, Spot.
?
?
Hi!
Hungry?
Let's skip the buffet.
What do you say John Alden and Priscilla go out on the patio and look for some Indians or something?
Tom, I'm worried about my folks.
I don't think they're having a good time, and your parents have hardly spoken to them.
Well, I'll take care of that right now.
Here we are.
How do you do?
Happy, happy?
I'm sure you'll find something here that'll suit your taste.
Ah!
I certainly do.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Eddie?
Eddie, I have your milk.
Would you put it under the door?
Now, Eddie, I want you to get into bed right away.
Do you hear me?
That's just what I'm doing.
All right, then.
Good night.
Good night.
Up we go!
Quiet!
Quiet, everybody!
Please!
Quiet!
I have a little prize for the most original costume of the evening.
I vote for George Washington!
Thanks, boys.
I vote for Daniel Boone!
I vote for our hostess, Miss Juliet.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, please!
No, not at my own party.
I vote for King Arthur!
Come on, fella, take your helmet off!
- Yeah, take it off.
Take it off.
-   Hey!
He's wearing one mask under another mask!
Oh, uh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
I'd just like to say that I'm sure, in his illustrious career, even King Arthur never had a more memorable night.
?
?
Come on, Herman.
Grandpa.
We're leaving.
Leaving?
But, Lily, I was just having fun.
And I just won a prize.
Oh, sure, sure.
For "wearing one mask under another".
Lily?
Lily!
Don't you know when you've been insulted?
Those people just tried to make a fool out of you.
You know something, Lily?
This is my face.
I think they did insult me.
Oh, come on, Herman.
Tom Daly, your family did this whole thing just to embarrass my uncle.
Now you take me right home!
Marilyn, what's going on?
He wins first prize, and now you're all mad!
Oh!
You told me you had a fun family!
Thank you so much, Mrs. Morton.
Oh, your little Eddie was no trouble at all.
If he didn't have that peculiar habit of howling like a wolf, I wouldn't have known he was in the house!
Good night!
Good night.
What did she mean by "Eddie's peculiar habit"?
Don't all children howl when the moon comes up?
Uh, someone's on the front porch.
Oh, it's probably Tom Daly bringing Marilyn home.
I do hope she's not too serious about him.
I'd hate to have those awful parents of his in this family.
Well, all the lights are off.
I guess your folks must have stopped off on the way home.
You, uh, going to invite me in?
I don't think I should.
Now, look.
I don't know what happened at the party tonight, but great big old John Alden just can't let Priscilla go into that cold, dark house all by herself.
Thanks anyway, Tom.
The least I can do is to come in and hold your trembling little hand.
Tom!
What are you so nervous about?
Listen.
Why don't I go out in the kitchen and fix some coffee?
And, uh, you go on into the living room.
Turn on a light.
The switch is right beside the door.
Don't be too long.
Ooh, Tom.
Come right in.
Yes.
Uh, hello, Thomas.
We just got out of our masquerade costumes, and we're relaxing.
You mean, you He She Oh, no!
Uncle Herman, what happened?
Why is Tom running?
I don't know.
It-It was extremely rude of him not even to say good-bye.
I'm not surprised.
With a family like that, how could he have any manners?
Well, looks like I scared another one away.
But for once, I'm kind of glad.
I must say, there was something strange about that boy.
He had the weirdest hairdo I've ever seen.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Thanks, Jack.
I've had a wonderful evening.
This is where you live?
Yep, this is it.
Come on in and have a cup of coffee?
I want you to meet my aunt and uncle.
Well, I, uh I guess I could walk you to the front door.
Sure you won't change your mind and come in?
I don't think so.
It's pretty late.
What's the matter?
Lose your keys?
No.
I probably just left them in my other purse.
Oh.
Why are you whispering?
I don't want to wake your folks.
Oh, don't worry about them.
They're always up all night.
Someone's coming.
Hello, Marilyn.
Hi, Uncle Herman.
Uncle Herman, I'd like to have you meet my date.
This is  Oh, Uncle Herman.
What's the matter with me, anyway?
Well How's the game, Grandpa?
Oh, I've got him this time!
I've really got him!
At the sound of the tone, it'll be 8:09.
Nevermore.
Nevermore.
Your move.
Oh, you you You fell right into my trap.
?
?
Eddie!
What are you doing in that fireplace again?
- You know you're not supposed to sit in a draft.
- Oh, I'm having fun.
Eddie, don't talk fresh to your mother and come out of there.
Gee.
Now, you be a good boy.
See?
Mommy sewed the ear back on your Woof-Woof.
Gee, I don't want to go to bed yet.
It's still dark out.
Eddie, you will do as you're told.
Aw, you're always picking on me.
You never holler at Marilyn that way.
Just never you mind about Marilyn.
You must remember she's not as fortunate as the rest of us.
Now you get on up to bed.
And don't forget to close the lid.
Night, Eddie.
I just came down to say good night.
You got home early, dear.
Did you have a nice time?
Yes, I guess so.
Would you like a little something to eat?
I have some warm ladyfingers In the oven.
No, thank you, Aunt Lily.
Night, everybody.
Good night, Marilyn.
- Night, Grandpa.
- Good night, darling.
Marilyn I hope you're not going to start that again, Herman.
Well, she's your niece, you know.
She's your sister's kid.
Nobody on my side of the family ever looked like that.
It's just one of those unfortunate things that happen.
Poor dear.
I wish she'd get married.
We could use some fresh blood in this family.
We'd all like to see her get married.
But she just doesn't seem to be able to hold a man.
Well, if you don't do something about it soon, we'll have her on our hands forever.
I have to do something about it?
Why always me?
It's enough I have to go out and scare up the rent every day.
You think you're the only one who works hard?
How would you like to have to clean nine rooms and a dungeon every day?
Will you stop the arguing?
There's enough noise in here to wake the living.
Grandpa, we just don't want to see Marilyn end up an old maid.
All right.
All right.
I'll take care of it.
I'll get her a suitable beau.
You?
How are you gonna do it?
Well, don't you worry about it.
Why, in the Old Country, whenever we needed a man, didn't I always manage to dig somebody up?
Hmph!
L l-I thought he was gonna get a fan down there.
?
?
No, not now, Igor, please.
Go away.
Go away.
Not now.
Now, let's see what we have.
"Poison apples, poison bananas, poison fruit salad, poison enchiladas".
Hmm!
"Poison TV dinners".
Hmph.
"Poison".
Now, why are you showing me poisons, huh?
Can't you understand English?
"Potions," I said.
"Potions".
Love potion, please.
Thank you.
Aha!
There it is.
"To win the love of man or maid, "quaff this potion unafraid.
"To have the lover of thy choosing, shake the bottle well ere using".
Now, the first thing to do is Ah, yes.
Yes, yes.
Sift in a cup of powdered whale heart.
?
?
A teaspoon of nightingale tongues.
?
?
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
A pinch of hexachlorophene.
?
?
A touch of Frank Sinatra.
And now, for the secret ingredient a woman's tears.
Ooh, that's mighty powerful stuff!
?
?
Ah.
Now.
If I could just get Marilyn to drink this potion, why, every man who sees her will fall in love with her.
Oh, I tell you if this stuff turns out half as good as the batch I made for Elizabeth Taylor, why, then Marilyn will be irresistible!
Oh, it's you, Mr. Bloom!
Oh, yes.
It's me, all right.
I thought it might be them.
Since they moved in, one has to be prepared for anything.
Oh, you don't have to tell me, Mrs. Cribbins.
Smell this.
What is it?
Garlic.
Wards off evil.
Does it work?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, indeed.
Keeps their kind away.
Yes, well, I can understand why.
I mean, did you ever see the wife?
She's not exactly what I'd call a live one.
Mmm, you can say that again.
And the one they call Herman.
He has the kind of body you expect to see fall out of a closet.
And this was such a nice neighborhood until they moved in.
Well, I suppose there's no use putting it off any longer.
I've gotta deliver a package over there.
Oh, by the way, what are those workmen doing out in your backyard?
Installing an electric fence.
Those Munsters are not running me off my property.
But I don't want them wandering over here, if you know what I mean.
Keep them in their place.
That's the ticket, Mrs. Cribbins.
Good morning.
Morning.
What's that?
Oatmeal.
Oatmeal!
Blech!
Why can't we eat like we did in the old days?
Oh, uh, is this Marilyn's bowl?
Yes, of course.
She always sits there.
Might as well start without them.
You know, I, uh I don't feel so hungry right now.
I think I'll grab something later in the laboratory.
Grandpa!
You know you're not supposed to smoke before breakfast!
Morning, Aunt Lily.
Good morning, dear.
I'm late.
I gotta run.
I'll grab a cup of coffee at the school cafeteria.
Oh.
Very well, dear.
Uh, try not to get home before dark.
Bye.
Oh, dear.
Everything's ice cold.
Morning, Mom.
Morning, Eddie.
Morning, dear.
Good morning, dear.
Isn't Marilyn coming down to breakfast?
Oh, she's already left.
Oh.
Well, that's just as well.
I wanted to speak to you about her anyway.
Oh, you mean about her problem with boys?
Yes.
You know, Lily, I think it's partially our fault.
What do you mean?
Well, maybe we should try and be more friendly with people.
You must admit that ever since we moved into this house, we've hardly had anything to do with the neighbors.
They must think we're terrible snobs.
If we don't make an effort to be a little more friendly with the people in this community, we're never gonna attract any young men to this house.
Well, for Marilyn's sake, I'll try.
Good.
That's the spirit.
Mmm.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm!
Lily, it just came over me.
You've never looked more lovely.
Strange.
I was just thinking how particularly handsome you looked this morning.
Isn't anybody gonna say how lovely I look?
I think there's someone at the front door.
Well, whoever it is, try and be a little bit more friendly.
Of course.
Oh, if you're looking for me, I'll be out back watering the weeds.
- Yes?
- Um  Eh A A package.
Uh, s-sign here, please.
Thank you.
Well, hello there!
I'm Mr. Bloom, your postman.
Mind if I ask you a question?
Not at all.
Do you believe in love at first sight?
Is it gonna be much longer?
Uh, uh, may l May I be of some assistance?
Mr. Bloom!
Please!
Call me Warren.
Warren, please!
Call me Tiger.
Ooh!
I must look a fright.
Oh!
Not at all, Mrs. Cribbins.
Yolanda.
After all, we are neighbors.
All right.
Yolanda.
My friends call me Yo-Yo.
- Yo-Yo?
- What is it, darling?
Oh, my darling!
My darling!
I love you!
I love you!
-  -   I can't understand the way that mailman carried on.
Perhaps I used too much perfume.
And that Mrs. Cribbins, the way she went for me.
Maybe I just came on too strong.
A little bit of that old Munster charm goes a long way.
I can't imagine what he sees in me.
After all, I'm not exactly a schoolgirl anymore.
Are you kidding?
Hah!
Why, Lily, you're as lovely today as the day I married you.
Oh, and you're just as handsome.
You know, they just don't make men like you anymore.
Come in.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on around this madhouse?
What are you talking about?
Mmm!
What am I talking about?
Here.
I'll show you.
Come with me.
?
Can it be the trees?
?
That fill the breeze?
?
With rare and magic perfume?
It's Tiger!
?
Oh, no, it isn't the trees?
?
It's Warren Bloom?
Poor devil.
You'd better go down there and straighten him out.
I'll straighten him out.
No, no, Grandpa!
I'll go down and talk to him.
Oh, and Herman, you might as well go over and have a little talk with Mrs. Cribbins.
She's been calling every 10 minutes.
Oh, and whatever you do, let her down easy.
Be kind to her.
All right.
But don't expect too much.
Uh, the woman's mad about me.
?
?
?
That fill the breeze?
Well, hello there.
Mrs. Cribbins.
Hello there.
I was just on my way over to see you.
Oh, you naughty boy.
You promised to call me Yo-Yo.
Well, Yo-Yo Uh, Yo-Yo?
Hmm?
Feeling better, Mr. Bloom?
Oh, yes.
Dear me, yes.
Much better now that you're here.
Oh, wait, now, Mr. Bloom.
That's just the sort of thing I want to talk to you about.
Herman!
Wait for Yo-Yo!
You really must control yourself, Mr. Bloom.
Lily!
Lily!
Excuse me.
My husband needs me.
I need you more!
Don't leave me, my pet!
Herman, wait for Yo-Yo.
!
Darling.
!
My sweet.
!
I love you.
!
Don't you understand?
You will love me!
Boo!
No, my pigeon!
You bring out the beast in me!
Front door!
Ohh!
Will somebody please get that door?
Herman!
Lily!
Herman, wait for Yo-Yo!
No respect for old age.
Sorry, Grandpa.
I forgot my key.
Oh, I'm not surprised.
Nothing that happens around here surprises me.
Oh, uh, incidentally, how did your date go tonight?
I think this one really likes me.
He's asked to see me again.
Of course.
That stuff never fails.
What stuff?
Oh, just a little something I put in your oatmeal this morning.
Love potion.
Makes you irresistible!
But, Grandpa, I didn't have any oatmeal today.
Well, don't worry.
I'll mix up another batch for you tomorrow.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry, Grandpa.
Don't you see?
This means he likes me for myself.
Oh, well, but even so, a little magic now and then never hurts.
Grandpa, there's more than one kind of magic.
Hmm.
If Marilyn didn't get it, I wonder who did.
I love you!
Control yourself!
I think I'd better go to my room.
That stuff s gonna wear off, and it's gonna be any second now.
Darling, darling.
I love you, my darling.
I love you with every fiber of my being.
Eee!
?
?
Well, dear, think we let them down easy enough?
Grandpa?
Did you get rid of the rest of that love potion like I told you to?
Yes, I got rid of it.
I don't like the way you're laughing, Grandpa.
Just how did you get rid of it?
I, uh, threw it over the fence into Mrs. Cribbins's garden.
I think I got her right in the cabbages.
It was very nice of you to come over this evening, Mr. Bloom.
Frankly, since that terrible experience, I've been afraid to be alone.
Well, it was very nice of you to ask me, Mrs. Cribbins.
We bachelors don't get a home-cooked meal very often.
Well, I hope you enjoy what I've cooked, Mr. Bloom.
Oh, I'm sure I will, Mrs. Cribbins.
Would you like a sniff, Mr. Bloom?
Well, what is it, Mrs. Cribbins?
Corned beef and cabbage the cabbage right out of my own garden, Mr. Bloom.
Yo-Yo, call me Tiger!
Well, I guess it takes all kinds of people to make a world.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
-  - Oh, there you are, Herman.
- Why haven't you come to bed?
- I'm just going over these bills.
Oh, you've been reading in the dark again.
It'll ruin your eyes.
And then we'll have to get you another pair.
Lily, just look at this.
$103 for electricity!
Well, you know.
Grandpa needs a lot of electricity  To carry on his experiments in the dungeon.
Why can't he have his dungeon in the attic, where there's plenty of light?
And that's not all.
There's taxes, food, braces for Eddie's fangs I tell ya.
I just can't sleep!
You poor dear.
You do look dead on your feet.
Why don't you take a nice, long walk in the night air?
It may help to clear your mind.
Okay, Lily.
I'll give it a try.
I think I'll talk a walk over to Midcity Park.
It's quiet over there.
Chief Harris, we're still getting complaints about that mysterious purse-snatcher who's been seen around Midcity Park.
All right, Sergeant.
Have them put a couple more squad cars in the area.
Yes, sir.
And tell them to pick up anybody who even looks suspicious.
Okay, Chief.
Good evening.
Oh!
Police!
Police!
I want to report a monster!
Here's your breakfast, Eddie.
Thanks, Mom.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning, Marilyn.
Morning, Eddie!
Morning, Pop.
!
Good morning, everybody!
Good morning, Grandpa.
Good morning, Grandpa.
How do you want your eggs, Grandpa?
Gloomy-side up, please!
Well, I'm off.
Good-bye, everybody.
Bye!
Good-bye, dear.
Oh, the Angels won again!
There's a frightening headline.
"Creature Terrorizes Midcity Park".
"Last night, the police department received several reports "of what was described by eyewitnesses "as a fiendish monster roaming in Midcity Park at approximately 12:30 a.m." Isn't that ridiculous?
It just so happens that I was in the park last night, at that time!
And I didn't see any fiends or monsters.
Well, I'd just as soon you wouldn't go walking in the park at night for a while.
Ketchup, please.
Gee, Dad.
Can I go with you to see the fiendish monster next time?
Oh, for goodness' sakes, Eddie.
What's all this talk about fiends and monsters?
There's no such thing.
Sit down and eat your breakfast.
Just to be on the safe side, I think we all ought to stay close to the house for the time being.
Lily, none of this talk is gonna stop me from taking my nightly walk.
I slept like a baby last night.
Walking seems to be the only thing that cures my insomnia.
Don't make such a big deal out of it.
Lots of people have insomnia, and you don't find them losing any sleep over it.
What's troubling you, anyway?
Well, Grandpa, we've been having some financial worries lately.
Well it just so happens that right now I am working on a fabulous invention that will make this family some big money.
- What kind of invention?
- I'm not talking.
Why, that's the way Edison got the electric light away from me.
Quiet!
Now, everybody, calm down!
Just calm down.
- Now.
What did he look like?
- Well, he was about nine feet tall.
And he was all green!
I know that guy.
!
He's theJolly Green Giant.
!
It was only a matter of time till he ran amok.
And his hands were ice cold.
Yeah, I told ya.
It's that frozen food he handles.
He had no hair, and his eyes were bright red.
Oh, that's not true.
!
Only the white parts were red.
All right, now.
Everybody please calm down!
Calm down here!
Now, it'll all be taken care of.
I can assure you, the department will do all it can to apprehend this so-called "monster".
- I'll drink to that!
- The reporters would like to ask a few questions, Chief.
No.
I'm sorry.
Now now, gentlemen.
When we have a statement ready, we'll let you know.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
That'll be fine, folks.
Thank you all very much.
Why do things like this have to happen just when there's a shake-up in the department?
When the commissioner arrives, I'll be in my office.
Okay, Chief.
Chief Harris here.
Give me the radio room.
Mulligan?
Chief Harris.
I want an around-the-clock stakeout in Midcity Park.
Tell them to be on the lookout for a greenish man, about nine or 10 feet tall, with bright red eyes and cold hands.
Mulligan, it's remarks like that that have kept you from making sergeant!
What is it, Grandpa?
What's it supposed to do?
It's an enlarging machine.
It can make anything bigger.
Why, with this machine, I can make an ordinary banana big enough to feed a family of monkeys for a whole year!
Anything small, I can make big.
Ooh, why with this machine, I could make Rhode Island the size ofTexas!
We'll make millions!
Then I'll make them bigger.
I could even make the world's biggest Mickey Rooney.
!
Here.
Let me show you.
?
?
Herman, honey?
Lower.
?
?
What was that?
Oh, that's just Grandpa, working on his invention down in the lab.
Oh.
I don't understand it!
Hmm, why you Ooh, allow me.
I think I know what's wrong.
I'm not using enough electricity!
There we are, Edgar.
Got a nice, fresh box of goodies for you.
There you go.
Put him in the ca C-Ca Okay.
Wait.
So help me, Commissioner Ludlow, that's what he said: Nine feet tall and green!
Oh, ridiculous, Sergeant.
You must have misunderstood him.
Oh, hello there, Commissioner.
Just giving Edgar his din-din.
Harris Do you mind taking that bird off of your head long enough to tell me what all this talk is about monsters?
Herman?
Aren't you ever coming to bed?
What's the use?
I just don't seem to be able to get any sleep anymore.
Have you tried counting wolves?
I've tried everything!
The only thing that seems to help is taking a walk in the park.
Herman, I don't want you to go to the park.
Not with that fiend, or monster, running around loose.
Lily.
Honestly, you're worse than Eddie.
In this day and age, no enlightened person believes in fiends and monsters.
Nevertheless, I don't want you to go walking around in the park.
Not until they catch whatever it is.
Lily.
I'm a full-grown man.
I refuse to be caught up in this hysteria.
If a man can't feel safe in the streets of his own town, what's this country coming to?
What's that?
That's just Grandpa again, working on his invention.
That settles it.
I'll never get any sleep around here.
Lily, I'm going out.
Good night, dear.
Terrific, terrific, Eddie.
We'll make millions!
Now.
Now.
Just keep your eye on this pencil.
Watch this.
Grandpa, that's great!
You turned that into the biggest pencil I ever saw!
Can you make me bigger too?
I want to be as big as Daddy.
Of course!
Now, just stand right here.
Don't move!
Hold still!
Look what you did!
What happened?
L-I must have put it in reverse.
It's all right.
I'll fix it.
Hold still!
War surplus parts!
Here he comes!
Get him.
Now, where the heck is that fuse box?
Ah, here it is.
Oh.
Now!
Maybe I'm not using enough current!
Yeah!
There.
Herman!
What's the matter?
Don't be frightened.
I'll protect you.
What are you talking about?
Th-The thing.
The horrible thing.
You were right, Lily.
It grabbed me in the park.
It was awful.
It had two heads and four long blue arms.
I warned you not to go out there, Herman.
You won't have to warn me again.
Don't worry.
I'm not stepping foot out of this house until they catch that thing!
Oh, shush.
Hush, dear.
Hush, dear.
There's no sense alarming the rest of the family.
We just won't mention this to them.
Now, let's go on upstairs and try to get some sleep.
Sleep?
I'll never sleep again.
Oh, at least try.
Okay.
I'll try.
But Lily, is it all right if we leave the lights on?
I tell ya, Chief, like they said, nine feet tall and all green!
We're lucky to have escaped with our lives!
The taxpayers aren't paying you to escape.
You're supposed to capture him.
Like they do in the movies, you know?
Now, both of you, get back to your posts in that park.
But, Chief, it's still dark out!
You wouldn't want to walk us over there, would you?
Get outta here!
Just what in the name of Pat O'Brien do you think you're doin'?
I'm holding up the ceiling, Commissioner.
May I suggest that your time would be more profitably spent by trying to catch that monster who has been terrorizing our parks?
Now, this is the last time I intend to be awakened in the middle of the night by citizens' committees, demanding to know what's being done.
Yeah, but, Commissioner Unless you take immediate action to apprehend this fiend, you will be back pounding a beat in the most desolate, deserted, law-forsaken section of town that I can find!
You got that, Harris?
Yes, sir.
I'll get him tonight, Commissioner.
That's my promise, or you can have my badge, sir.
Oh, this is a great moment for me.
All right, all right.
It's a great moment for us.
All of a sudden, I've got a partner.
Now.
How did this happen?
More current!
More current!
Men, it must have occurred to you by now that we've had absolutely no success whatsoever in apprehending the monster that has been terrorizing Midcity Park.
It's obvious that, in this case, ingenuity, imagination, intelligence do not work.
Therefore, I have decided to handle this matter myself.
That's all, men.
Dismissed.
Is that the box, Sergeant?
Yes, sir.
That's it.
What's in it?
That box contains a secret formula that will manacle the midnight marauder of Midcity Park!
?
?
?
?
Lily, when is Grandpa gonna be finished working in his laboratory?
The sound of that machinery is making me nervous.
Now, you're just on edge because you haven't been getting much sleep lately.
He should be turning it off soon.
It's getting pretty late.
By the way, what time is it?
At the tone, it'll be later than you think.
Nevermore.
I had no idea it was that late.
Where's Marilyn?
I'm glad to be able to say she finally got a date tonight.
Oh!
Well, isn't that nice?
Where did she go?
Oh, they went to a movie, and then they're going for a walk in the park.
In the park?
In the park?
Eddie.
How could you let Marilyn go to the park with that monster running around?
But you said there was no such thing as monsters.
Oh, Herman.
What are we going to do?
Well, I guess someone will have to go to the park and protect her.
I'll get my coat!
No!
Lily, I'll go alone.
Oh, y-you can't go out there alone!
Why don't you take Spot with you?
- Ha!
Spot's afraid of his own shadow.
-  Come to think of it, I don't blame him.
Chief Harris will be right out, Commissioner.
Oh, what's takin' him so long in there?
He didn't confide in me, sir.
He said he was workin' on a secret weapon.
I guess he's ready.
You can go in now, sir.
Oh, hello, Commissioner.
Come in.
It's me.
Why couldn't I have been a fireman, like my mother wanted me to?
-  - That's Marilyn.
I'd know her voice anywhere.
I'll have some more of these pancakes.
You've had quite enough, Grandpa.
The rest are for Herman.
After what he went through last night, he deserves them.
Sure, sure.
Herman always gets everything.
Lucky stiff.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, Herman.
Morning, dear.
Oh!
Good morning!
Ahh.
Oh.
Thank you.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, dear.
Uncle Herman?
Yes, dear?
I want to apologize again for causing you all so much worry.
Oh!
That's all right, dear.
As I told you last night, I wasn't hurt at all.
Fact is, we came right home after the movie.
We never went near the park at all.
I'm glad you didn't.
It was terrible!
I've never had a more hair-raising experience.
And if you think my hair was raised, you should have seen the hair on the baldheaded lady.
Herman, I've told you a hundred million times, don't exaggerate.
!
I'm not exaggerating.
It really happened.
Ohh!
Maybe there's something about it in the paper.
You were right, Aunt Lily.
Here it is.
It says, "Last night, the police apprehended the so-called monster "that has been terrorizing Midcity Park.
"The monster was a known purse-snatcher who disguised his features by wearing a woman's stocking over his head".
See?
I told you there was no such thing as monsters.
"Credit for his capture goes to Police Chief Harris, "who used himself as bait by disguising himself as a woman.
Well, I guess that explains your baldheaded lady.
"He was heroically assisted by an unknown citizen who has modestly refused to come forward and reveal his identity".
Gee, Dad.
Weren't you scared?
Well, a little bit.
But remember this, Eddie.
It's the duty of every citizen to protect the police.
According to the newspaper, Chief Harris is getting a medal from the police commissioner at this very moment!
Harris, I must admit that in the past, I've been a little leery about your, uh well, to say the least, eccentric behavior.
But, I must say, you do seem to get things done.
Well, thank you, sir.
Tell me, Harris.
Do you have any idea who the citizen was who came to your assistance?
Well, I don't know his name, sir, but I think I could describe him.
Oh?
What'd he look like?
Well, he was about nine or 10 feet tall, with green skin, uh, red eyes and long arms.
Fine.
Right.
Very good.
I don't know.
L-I apologize.
I'm sorry.
I thought my machine would make a fortune for this family.
But somehow, I just can't seem to generate enough electricity.
That's all right, Grandpa.
Don't worry about it.
We all love you anyway, Grandpa.
Ah, but one good thing though.
It did help cure Herman of his insomnia.
How did you do it?
Ohh!
With one of these giant sleeping pills I made with my machine!
How could he swallow that?
Oh, he didn't swallow that.
I accidentally dropped it on his head.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Gentlemen, shall we begin the operation?
Scalpel.
Pulse rate, falling.
Forceps.
Breathing, labored.
Sutures.
This is a very dangerous operation.
Oh, I know.
Just let me concentrate.
You've got to save her, Dr. Basey.
Her father owns the hospital.
There goes that set again.
Right in the middle of my favorite comedy.
Try another channel, Grandpa.
Will you be quiet, Igor?
He hates television ever since Bat Masterson went off the air.
All right, Igor.
Good night.
Good night.
You shouldn't have repaired this thing with those war surplus radar parts.
Why are you so hotheaded, Herman?
I can't help it.
That's the way I'm made.
Maybe you'll get a new TV set for your birthday.
You and your radar parts.
It's tuning in on our own house again.
Hey, look.
There's Eddie trying to catch dinner for the cat.
- We'll get him this time.
-  -  Missed me!
-  Look, there's Marilyn and Lily in the kitchen.
I wonder if they're talking about us.
See if you can tune in the sound.
I love to eavesdrop.
It'll be wonderful for Eddie to have a little playmate, Aunt Lily.
But what about breaking the news to Uncle Herman?
Oh, that's not important.
Telling Herman is a little detail I can take care of anytime.
A new playmate for Eddie.
Did you hear that, Herman?
She's having a baby?
And telling me is just a detail?
Isn't that typical of women?
So often the husband is the last to know.
What do you think, Grandpa?
Will it be a boy or a girl?
Probably.
Aunt Lily, a minute ago while we were talking, did you have the feeling someone was watching us?
No.
But I'll check.
Eddie, are you hiding in there again?
Nope, not in there.
Maybe Grandpa's hanging in the cupboard.
Grandpa.
Nevermore.
I wish that stupid raven would stay in his clock.
I guess I was mistaken.
Oh, Marilyn.
It'll be such fun having another child around the house, even if it's only for a little while.
How long will the little fellow be with us?
Just a week or so.
He's Dr. Dudley's son.
I've been babysitting with them.
Oh, yes.
Our family doctor.
Herman went to him once, but the poor fellow fainted during the examination.
It upset Herman so much he never went back.
The doctor and his wife are going to a convention.
So I said we'd keep little Elmer until they come back.
Here's Dr. Dudley's card, so we can get in touch with him.
Hmm.
I think I'll break the news to your Uncle Herman gently.
His birthday's coming up this week and you know how he feels about strange people in the house.
Yes, you better tell him when he's in a good mood.
We wouldn't want him to go all to pieces.
Oh, I know.
It's such a nuisance putting him back together again.
Devil's food cake.
They all love it.
Oh, isn't it restful to sit out here after supper, Herman?
Yes.
We had weather just like this on our honeymoon.
Remember?
What a beautiful spot that was.
Devil's Island.
Too bad they closed it down.
Seems like all the really nice resorts are gone.
It's a shame we've never kept in touch with that charming Captain Dreyfuss.
Hmm.
You're not very talkative this evening, Lily.
Are you sure there isn't anything you want to tell me?
I mean, anything about a little, uh, bundle?
-  - Bundle?
Oh, I'm glad you reminded me, Herman.
I have a whole bundle oflaundry downstairs.
I must go out and hang it on the line, take advantage of this beautiful weather.
Lily, you just dropped a piece of pap Lily.
"Dr. Dudley, M.D."?
Well, here we are, Herman.
"4919 Woodbury Drive".
Dr. Dudley's house.
I hate to do this behind Lily's back, Grandpa.
Now, Herman.
You're her husband.
If she's going to be coy about it and not tell you what's going on, you've gotta find out everything for yourself.
Well, at least we won't be bothering them at this hour.
It's only 4:00 in the morning.
Of course.
I've seen those intern movies.
This is just about the time when most doctors are getting home from all those wild parties they have all the time.
Come on.
Edward, what are you doing?
What am I doing?
I'm dying of indigestion.
That's what I'm doing.
Shh, shh.
Couldn't you be a little more quiet about it?
Do you want to wake up little Elmer?
I lost my darn glasses, and you know I can't see a thing without them.
You and your oysters Rockefeller.
For the past two hours, I've been having the most horrible nightmares.
I'm going downstairs and drink some hot milk.
Oh, you look awful, dear.
Get back in bed.
You're sick.
That's you.
I'm over here.
I wondered what you were doing in my pajamas.
I'll get it, dear.
Now remember, Herman.
Don't beat around the bush.
Just ask him point-blank about Lily.
Okay, if you say so.
Yes, yes?
What is it at this hour?
Excuse me, Doctor, but could I ask you something?
Well, who are you?
You look like a patient of mine.
One that I lost recently.
I'm Herman Munster.
And you're our family doctor.
Oh, yes.
Didn't I examine you once?
Yes, but you fainted in the middle of the examination.
Did I?
I gotta watch that fainting.
It could be quite embarrassing if I fainted in the middle of an operation.
Doctor, could you answer a question?
How do you like that?
When I don't have my glasses on, I hear double.
No, this is Grandpa.
Oh.
Looks rather like a tall penguin, doesn't he?
What was the question?
Oh, well, it's about my wife and I. Uh, I wanted to know  Whether we're expecting.
Expecting?
Expecting what?
You know, a child at our house.
Oh, yes.
All the arrangements have been made.
Oh, thank you, Doctor.
Thank you.
Oh, say, now I remember you.
You had your doggie with you the last time too.
Friendly little fellow, isn't he?
Giving me his paw.
Well, good night.
You see, Herman?
I told you it was true.
The moment you found his card, I knew he wasn't treating Lily for no hangnail.
Well, did you get your hot milk, dear?
I couldn't find the kitchen.
Anyway, someone came to the door.
Who was it?
That Mr. Munster.
His niece is gonna take care of little Elmer for us.
I don't know what he was driving at.
Well, anyway, it's very nice of them to do it for us.
Marilyn is so sweet.
What is her uncle like?
I couldn't get him in focus too well without my specs.
All I'm sure of is he was nine feet tall and had a penguin with him that turned out to be his grandfather.
Oh, Edward.
You'd better get some sleep.
I didn't think worrying about Medicare was upsetting you this much.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
All I need is a good night's rest.
Okay.
Good night, honey.
Good night.
My, this mattress is lumpy.
I've got something important to ask you.
Uncle Herman's not around, is he?
No, he took Spotty down to the car wash for his weekly bath.
I just don't know what to get him for his birthday.
Do you think he'd like a new snakeskin tobacco pouch?
I don't think so, dear.
The old one is still wiggling.
What are you getting him?
Well, he's been talking about a second car for months now.
I have an appointment with a car dealer downtown.
A car would be a wonderful surprise for Uncle Herman.
I'm going to pick it out today and have it delivered on his birthday.
Well, maybe I'll just get him another season pass to Forest Memorial Park.
Hello there.
Are you Diamond Jim?
Yes, ma'am.
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Munster.
I called here about an hour ago.
Are you the one I talked to?
No, it must have been my brother, Diamond Irving.
You looking for a bargain in luxury transportation?
Yes.
I would like something nice for my husband's birthday.
Excuse me, lady.
But were you ever in the movies?
Oh, yes.
Just last Saturday night we saw a lovely picture, The Body Snatchers.
No, no.
I mean, I thought I might have seen you on the late, late show.
Me?
Oh, well.
Now, how about this little baby first?
Oh.
Hmm, how much is this one?
Isn't it a dream?
7,800.
Executive car, turned in yesterday by a California minister.
I'm afraid my husband wouldn't like leopard skin.
Do you have anything upholstered in wolf hide?
Wolf hide?
Wolf hide.
Let me see.
How about this one?
Isn't this a beauty?
This little hotrod is done in genuine Tijuana tuck 'n' roll.
My, this is rather dashing, isn't it?
Yep.
And we do have a growing boy in the family.
Good.
Oh, look at that.
There is a handsome car.
You mean you like that one, lady?
Oh, yes.
Oh, this is the sort of car our family could get a lot of use out of.
Grandpa's been just dying for something like this.
If he saw it, he would just flip his lid.
But lady, this is not a car.
It's a I'll take it.
You will?
And that darling little roadster too.
You mean you want both of them?
If you can make a few modifications for me.
Yeah.
Now I'll tell you what I want you to do.
What?
Take that car there and this one.
Mm-hmm.
Call the custom body shop Yeah.
And tell them it's a rush job, and then have them Oh, Herman.
You know, I just love digging in the garden.
It makes you feel so close to the soil.
I know, the garden's looking much better this year too.
Everything's dying out early.
Yeah.
Herman, by the way, has Lily mentioned you know what, the little stranger?
Not a word.
It's been four or five days now, and I've given her all sorts of hints.
Well, I guess there's no understanding women.
You know, I never knew when half of my wives were expecting.
You know, Grandpa, I feel like relaxing after all that work outside.
How about a game of chess?
Hey, I got a better idea.
Why don't the two of us go in the living room and have a three-handed game of solitaire?
You're on.
Thank you.
That's right, Diamond Jim.
My husband's birthday is on Wednesday, and I want to be sure you have the car ready by then.
I haven't told my husband a thing about it.
It'll be a complete surprise to him.
She must be talking to the doctor about the new baby.
It will make a nice birthday gift.
I think it shows a lot more thought than just getting him a necktie, don't you?
Oh, yes.
I understand all about the 30-day guarantee.
And if my husband doesn't like it, we can always trade it in.
Trade it in?
Are you sure that she's talking about a baby?
And one more thing.
Don't forget about the seat covers.
Believe me.
She's talking about a baby.
Morning, Lily.
Good morning, dear.
Well, good morning.
Now, Lily.
I want you to do absolutely nothing while I set the table and fix breakfast.
That's very sweet of you, Herman, but Lily.
I will not have you slaving over a hot cauldron at a time like this.
Don't be silly, dear.
No, Lily.
I want you to sit right down at that table.
Let Herman put you in the driver's seat.
Herman, you're so forceful.
Only four plates this morning, darling.
Marilyn left early.
Hello, Grandpa.
Hello, everybody.
Bottom of the morning to you.
Grandpa, please.
Allow me.
Sit right down.
This morning, I'm fixing breakfast.
Oh, yes, yes.
I understand.
That's very thoughtful of you, Herman.
Lovely weeds for a lovely lady.
Thank you, dear.
Good morning.
Good morning, Eddie.
Good morning.
Eddie, Eddie.
Allow me.
There you go, son.
?
?
Hey, Daddy's getting breakfast.
What's up, Grandpa?
Shh.
?
?
Was Daddy playing poker all night with those men from the office?
No, dear.
He must have done something pretty bad to be acting this mushy.
Not at all, Eddie.
Your father is just naturally a sweet and kind man.
Aren't you, pussycat?
I try to be.
Mother.
Sit right down, dear.
I just fixed you a little snack for lunch.
Oh, strawberries and pickles?
Well, that's very thoughtful of you, Herman.
Not at all, dear.
You just sit there and enjoy your food while I play a little something for you on the organ.
?
?
Brahms's "Lullaby".
You play so well, dear.
Herman, there's something I want to tell you, and I've been waiting for the right moment.
It's about time, Lily.
But you don't have to say another word.
I already know.
You do?
Yes.
And I think the idea of having a little playmate for Eddie is just wonderful.
How did you find out?
Herman, sometimes I think you're absolutely uncanny.
Well, I guess I sort of accidentally eavesdropped on you and Marilyn.
And then I sort of ran into Dr. Dudley.
Oh, you old busybody, you.
Never mind that.
What I'm dying to know is when when the child is due.
I mean, approximately.
Approximately?
I can tell you exactly.
It's a boy.
He'll arrive at 9:00 tomorrow morning.
And his name is Elmer.
And then if he's hungry, he can sit down and have breakfast with us.
Herman, what's the matter?
You have that funny look on your face.
Oh, nothing.
I was just thinking that science has made some awfully big strides since Eddie was born.
But I guess automation is everywhere.
Hello.
Here we are, Elmer.
Aunt Lily, I want you to meet little Elmer.
Mrs. Dudley just dropped him off.
Well, so this is the little boy who's come to stay with us for a while.
Oh, isn't that fine?
Eddie, Elmer's here.
Hi, Elmer.
Hi.
Boy, you've got neat ears.
Aw, they're not so great.
Eddie, why don't you take Elmer in the other room to play?
Okay.
Come on, Elmer.
Here are some toys he brought with him.
Oh, neato!
Come on.
Isn't he a sweet little boy?
Yes, but he certainly isn't as handsome as Eddie.
I mean, his ears aren't the least bit pointed.
And, oh, what a dreadful haircut.
I do wish Herman hadn't slept so late.
The car I ordered got here an hour ago.
I mean, really, on his own birthday.
The least he could do would be to Shh, here he comes.
Morning, Lily.
Morning, dear.
Good morning, Marilyn.
Oh, thank you.
I kept your breakfast cold for you.
Oh, no, Lily.
I couldn't eat any breakfast this morning.
I'm much too excited.
You know, thinking about the child.
Oh, him.
Well, he got here a few minutes ago, right on schedule.
He's in the living room.
Oh, Herman!
Never mind that.
Lily, he just arrived?
And you're working here in the kitchen?
Well, why not?
He's in the living room.
Now why don't you go in and introduce yourself?
Introduce myself?
Go on, dearie.
Go on.
And then I have a real surprise for you.
Okay, Lily.
But, Lily, I don't think I can take too many more surprises today.
Gee, Elmer.
You sure got a lot of neat stuff to play with.
How does this work?
By remote control.
I'll show you.
Put it down.
Son?
Elmer?
Son?
It's my boy!
It's my boy!
And he looks just like me!
Sonny!
Come to Daddy!
Herman!
Herman, what's all the excitement?
It's my son.
He's here.
And, Grandpa, look.
He's walking already.
Isn't he beautiful?
Isn't he beautiful?
Listen, Herman.
He's trying to say "Daddy".
Oopsy-daisy.
They had the same trouble with me when I was his age.
Eddie.
Eddie, come here.
Eddie, meet your new playmate.
Playmate?
This is just a toy.
Here's my new playmate.
Elmer.
I want you to meet my pop.
How do you do, Mr. Munster?
You mean You mean this is You mean he You mean With a face like that?
Oh, no.
What a catastrophe!
You mean You mean it's someone else's child?
And we're just keeping him for a while?
Of course, dear.
I don't know how you could've gotten the wrong idea.
Oh, thank goodness.
I'd die if we ever had a child that looked like that.
Come on, Uncle Herman.
Aunt Lily has a wonderful birthday present to show you.
Oh.
Oh, I'd almost forgotten about it being my birthday.
Come along, Herman.
It's right outside.
Oh.
Step, step.
Don't open them till I tell you.
No peeking, Uncle Herman.
Take it easy.
This will be a surprise.
Oh, this is going to be a big surprise.
All right.
Bring it out, Grandpa.
Open your eyes now, Herman.
Lily!
Happy birthday.
How do you like it, Herman?
I had it customized just for you.
Oh, it's just beautiful.
Getting a car like this and finding out that little Elmer is not our child makes this the happiest birthday I've ever had.
Come on, everybody.
Hop in!
I'll take us all for a ride through the cemetery.
Come on, Herman.
Hop in!
Get in the back, Herman.
You all in?
?
For he's a jolly good fellow?
?
For he's a jolly good fellow?
?
For he's a jolly good fellow?
?
You know, Eddie.
You got the neatest parents in the whole world.
I know, Elmer.
I know.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Uh, Igor?
Igor?
Igor, will you hold this a second?
Dropped it again.
Butterclaws.
Are you feeling any better, Herman?
Well, uh, uh, my headache's gone.
But my sinuses are killing me.
Oh, and, uh, Grandpa.
This draft down here isn't helping any either.
Don't be ridiculous!
How can there be a draft Mr. Pike, this is the property in question right here.
Belongs to a family named Munster.
They're some kind of holdout.
Well, we've only got 60 feet to go for the two pipelines to connect.
Juncture-wise, that is.
So, Harkness, get somebody over there to secure the right-of-way.
Well, we sentJohnson over, B.T., but, uh, he didn't come back.
Well, get him on the phone!
I tried to, B.T., but the doctor at the sanitarium said there are no phones in the padded rooms.
That's what you get for hiring a neurotic.
If I don't get this pipeline completed on schedule, the mayor and the city council are going to have my head on a platter.
I'll tell you what you do: Put the pipeline under the Munster's house.
We don't even need to tell 'em about it.
Go down about 25 feet.
That should do it.
I don't know, B.T.
We could be in trouble.
Borden T. Pike laughs at trouble.
I don't intend to be intimidated by the Munsters.
Besides, what kind of trouble would we run into 25 feet underground?
Uh, that stuff you gave me yesterday didn't work at all.
Uh, have you got any-anything else?
I'll be right  Back!
Stay right here.
Don't go 'way!
Now, now, now.
Where did I put that stuff?
No, no, no, no.
That's not what I'm looking for.
And besides, I thought I told you to wait in the washing machine!
Uh, this isn't gonna hurt, is it?
Don't be such a baby, Herman.
?
?
Ahh!
?
?
?
?
And you expect me to believe a ridiculous story like that?
Horrible creatures, bats flying around Scare tactics, pure and simple.
They tried tojack up the price by putting on those ridiculous disguises.
Well, I know it-it sounds ridiculous, but that's the way this fellow reported the story to me.
Nonsense.
He just doesn't want to assume the responsibility for having broken into that cellar.
But sir, we never expected anyone to have a cellar that deep.
No excuses.
Now, get out of here.
And don't come back until you get a haircut.
Yes, sir.
All right, Harkness.
I'll handle this myself.
Fanny, dear, I called to tell you that I won't be home for supper tonight.
I have a very important business engagement across town.
All right.
Who is she?
Fanny, I'm not seeing a woman.
Yes, I did have lunch with a woman.
It was my mother!
Fanny, stop being so jealous.
I can't help it if my mother was a woman.
It could happen to anybody!
All right.
I'll speak to her about it.
Yes, dear.
Yes, dear.
Yes, dear!
I'll show those Munsters that Borden T. Pike will not be intimidated.
Spotty.
Get away from the door!
Get away!
Eddie!
Come and get Spot and put him in the kitchen this instant!
I'm terribly sorry, but Spotty gets so excited when we have visitors.
Won't you come in?
I'll come in, but remember I'm not easily taken in.
May I have your hat, Mr., uh Pike.
Borden T. Pike.
City Gas.
Come right in, Mr. Pike.
I'm Herman Munster.
This is my father-in-law, the Count.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Uh, won't you have a seat?
Now, we realized you were inconvenienced.
We're prepared to compensate you for the damage Why, hello there.
For the damage done to your basement.
In addition to which, we will pay you, uh, fifteen  Uh, $1,500 for the continuance of the right-of-way through your property.
That is my final offer.
$1,500!
That would come in very handy for a sunny day.
Boy, how much is that in cheese?
Uh, Eddie.
You've been told before.
Don't play with that mousetrap.
The mice will never go near it now.
Uh, well, Mr. Pike.
It sounds like a good deal to me.
Oh, good.
I'm against it.
The idea of sneaking a gas main under our property.
Thank you.
I urge you to accept my offer.
It will be good for your neighbors and friends.
The entire community will benefit from the pipeline.
Well, l-I would say, if it's good for the community, we have to accept.
I think we should take Herman's advice.
After all, he's always been the levelheaded one of the family.
I want no part of it.
I don't like the idea of anybody digging on the premises.
There's no telling who they'll come up with.
I urge you to accept my offer.
And don't think you're gonna get me to raise it, because I don't scare easy.
Mr. Pike.
Wait.
This is my house, and it's gonna be my way.
Uh, l-I agree with Lily.
We accept.
Eddie.
My boy.
I want you to be a witness to my degradation.
Now someday, you'll have creatures of your own.
You'll know what to expect.
This is what you want?
This is what you'll get.
If you want me, I'll be in my room.
Good night!
Oh, Grandpa!
Uh, you'll have to excuse Grandpa, Mr. Pike.
You know how old people  Mr. Pike?
Mr. Pike?
Ow.
!
Ow!
Boy.
I told him to keep his big trap shut.
Eddie!
I don't care what Grandpa says.
I'm gonna go call Mr. Pike right now and tell him we accept.
After all, we can't always think of ourselves.
W-We have to think of our neighbors too.
Herman, you certainly have a good heart.
Best money can buy.
Eddie!
Hello.
Uh, Mr. Munster?
Yes, this is Mr. Pike.
Oh, oh, Mr. Pike.
You left in such a hurry.
We didn't finish the deal.
If you like, I can drop over right now, sign the papers, and pick up the check.
No, no, don't do that!
I'll-I'll have my secretary m-mail it to you tomorrow.
Borden, who's that on the telephone?
Another one of your girlfriends?
No, it's a business call!
On, uh, second thought, Mr. Munster, it might be a good idea for you to drop over this evening.
I'd like my wife to meet you.
Yes.
I know where.
Oh, just a headstone's throw from here.
Be right over.
Bye now.
Oh, come on.
Ow!
That hurts!
Stop it.
There.
That's a good boy.
Now, Herman, I don't want you going out.
You've already had a sinus attack today.
And you're not looking well.
Ooh, you've even got color in your cheeks.
Really?
Oh.
Well, um, maybe you're right.
L My sinuses have been acting up.
Well, they were probably worn out when you got them.
Grandpa!
Are you going to hang around here sulking all night?
Why don't you go to your room?
Hmm!
Why should I?
Anyplace I hang myself is home.
Hi, Grandpa.
Oh, Marilyn.
I'm so glad you're here.
Would you mind going on an errand for us, to Mr. Pike's?
- I'd be happy to.
- Oh, and be sure to introduce yourself to his wife.
Uh, Mr. Pike said he'd like us to meet her.
And be warm and friendly.
It always pays off.
The idea.
A man your age carrying on like that.
Anything you say, dear.
And don't "dear" me!
As soon as you do, I know you're up to something.
Really, Borden, after all these years of marriage, you'd think you know where your place is by this time.
And as far as I'm concerned  I'll get the door, dear.
Don't you bother.
Don't you bother.
I'll get the door.
Fanny, dear, I think you'd better let me get the door.
We'll just see about that!
I'm Marilyn Munster.
Well.
I just happen to be Mrs. Pike.
I'm here for the money.
Your husband knows what it's for.
You horrible creature!
Well, what did you think of that?
Well!
What did you think of that?
Now are you going to listen to me?
Oh, how I would like to boil that Mr. Pike in oil!
But no.
You had to give away my cookbook to the Goodwill.
Okay.
Okay.
Don't worry about it.
I'll handle this myself.
The nerve of those people.
It makes me furious!
Herman, don't lose your head.
I'm-I'm gonna go call that Mr. Pike right now!
That's right, dear.
Don't be afraid.
You just show him who you're made of!
Pike?
This is Herman Munster.
Never mind that.
You can't treat my niece that way!
Oh, yeah?
Usually, I'm not a violent man.
But I'm coming over there right now and punch you in the nose.
Fanny?
Fa Fanny!
Yes?
Who was that at the door a few minutes ago?
Huh!
As if you didn't know!
It's that snippy little blonde of yours, that Marilyn Munster, or whatever her name is.
Oh, that's what he meant!
Her uncle is on his way here now.
He's We-Well, he's indescribable!
You'll have to leave immediately.
I'll stay here and defend our home.
Oh!
I get the picture.
Really, Borden, you're not about to use child psychology on me again.
No!
You can't get rid of me that way.
Obviously that little blonde creature is on her way here right now.
No, it's her uncle.
!
Well, don't think I'm gonna make it easy for the two of you.
I'm not about to!
And if there's any home defending to do, you can be sure I'm gonna do it!
It's him!
It's her.
Now, you stop that laughing, Eddie.
I can't help it.
Daddy looks so funny with that thing on his nose!
Never mind that.
Now you just finish your breakfast, and you'd better start dawdling, or you're going to be on time for school!
As I was saying, before I was so rudely interrupted, when Mr. Pike Morning, folks!
Morning.
Good morning.
Morning.
- Oh, isn't this a beautiful day!
- Thank you!
Does anybody mind if I continue with my story?
Not while I'm eating.
All right.
I won't tell you what happened!
Please, Herman, dear.
Do tell us what happened.
All right.
When Mr. Pike came out and saw his wife lying on the floor, he thought I hit her!
- He punched me in the nose.
- Oh, you poor dear!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Well, oh, one thing though.
I think it cured my sinus.
I'll get it.
- Truce!
- Truce.
Oh, dear, it stopped raining.
I'm afraid the weather's turning bad.
Uh, I came to apologize.
You see, when your niece came to my house, my wife was expecting someone else who, uh, never showed up.
That's all right, Mr. Pike.
I can understand it.
It happens to me a lot too.
I'm-I'm sorry I hit you.
I'm not ordinarily a violent man, but when I saw my wife lying there, l-l-l Oh, uh, lost your head?
Y-Yes, that's right.
Right on the nose!
Oh!
Please don't!
Don't say, "on the nose".
Well, if you're still interested in the deal, I brought a check for the amount that we agreed upon.
$1,500 for the right-of-way, if you'll just sign the contract.
Huh, don't you sign that!
But the mayor's waiting in my office!
If I don't bring this contract back with your signature, he'll have my head!
Grandpa, we made a deal.
Majority rules.
Don't be a sore loser.
Mr. Pike, you won't get away with this!
I'm sorry, Grandpa, but we made a deal.
Heel, Grandpa.
Down, Grandpa.
Down.
!
Oh, missed again.
Oh, these darn contact lenses.
Uh, you'll have to forgive Grandpa, Mr. Pike.
He doesn't give up easily.
Oh, that-that's all right.
Here.
You can use my pen.
Oh.
Thank you.
I don't understand!
It's a brand new pen.
Well, I'm a man that always knows when he's beat.
Here.
Why not use mine?
Thank you, Grandpa.
You won't be sorry.
You can say that again!
Thank you.
Thank you!
Won't you come in, Mr. Pike?
I was just about to brew a fresh flagon of tea.
No.
No, thank you.
I want to thank you, Mr. Munster.
Ever since your visit to my house, my wife's been a changed woman.
She says, from now on, she'll believe anything I say.
Well, it's nice to know, as we go through life, we can bring a little happiness to others.
Well, you've made me a very happy man.
Ha!
Nice man.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Oh!
It's Mrs. Cribbins, from next door.
Oh?
Really?
I see.
Yes.
Yes, that's fine.
Thanks for calling, Mrs. Cribbins.
Herman?
What's the matter?
Wh-What's the matter, Herman?
Mrs. Cribbins, and everyone else on the block, got $3,500 from the gas company.
And we only got $1,500.
He took advantage of our good natures.
I was right!
I knew we couldn't trust that man!
Wait a minute!
Here's another check for $5,000.
"Dear Munsters, A little bonus for all your trouble and inconvenience.
Your friend, Borden".
Oh, how generous ofhim.
!
There's more.
"P.S. After 30 years, I am finally a happily married man.
Since my wife and I met you, we've never looked so good to each other".
How sweet!
-  Isn't it?
- We can't possibly keep the money.
I mean Well, we just can't take money for helping people.
I guess you're right as usual, Lily.
It's like taking blood money.
Don't try to cheer me up.
I feel bad enough.
- What do you mean?
- My pen was filled with disappearing ink.
I just can't seem to get the right wavelength.
Grandpa, that crystal ball doesn't work anymore.
All you ever get are the reruns of My Little Margie.
I got it!
I got it!
I got it!
Pike, you're a disgrace!
Men like you give gas a bad name!
But, Your Honor, I saw Mr. Munster sign that with my own eyes!
L-I don't understand Pike, I suggest you resign and give up drinking.
In that order!
Grandpa, how did you do that?
I guess it's just in his blood!
I'll drink to that!
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Ah!
Here we are!
Look at that bird.
Mother, you've outdone yourself this time.
Just put it down and let me get started on it.
May we be truly thankful for what we're about to receive.
What does everybody want?
That tall, dark, handsome-looking fellow you're looking at is me.
I guess you're wondering what's going on here.
Well, it all started about 10 days ago, when I was invited to a reunion of my old army outfit.
You can't do it.
No matter how hard you try, it just won't fit.
I don't understand it.
It must have shrunk since I got out of the army.
Were you a hero in the war, Dad?
Well, I don't like to brag, Eddie, but when I'd get up out of that foxhole, the enemy would take one look at me in this uniform and run.
Come to think of it, a lot of our guys used to look at me and run too.
You can forget about wearing it to the reunion.
It just doesn't fit.
Look.
This is the first time in 20 years the guys from my old outfit are getting together.
They're all gonna be wearing their uniforms at the banquet.
How will it look if I'm the only guy to show up in civvies?
They'll all stare at me.
Herman, I don't want you to go at all.
I know what goes on at those so-called reunions.
Besides, if there's one thing you don't need, it's a banquet.
Just look at you.
What's wrong with me?
What's wrong?
You're too fat.
That's what's wrong.
Fat?
Me, fat?
Yeah.
Marilyn, I ask you am I too fat?
- Well - Never mind!
What are you yelling at Marilyn for?
I mean, don't you know that fat men are supposed to be jolly?
That's not the issue.
Herman, if you go to that reunion, you'll be away overnight.
Lily Herman, we haven't been separated in over a hundred years.
But, Lily, it's just one night.
I know just the way Lily feels.
I felt the same way about Grandma.
Oh, she was quite a woman, your grandma.
Lily, I wanna go to the reunion.
I wanna, I wanna!
I wanna!
All right, Herman.
I'll tell you what.
The reunion is still If you can lose enough weight to get into your uniform by then, you can go.
You got yourself a deal.
I'll just stop eating.
Oh, no.
No, no.
You'll have to to go to a doctor and have a physical examination.
Get him to put you on a sensible diet.
I don't want a sick corpse on my hands.
Okay.
You've got yourself a deal.
What are my appointments today?
Well, you have a new patient a Mr. Munster.
He's here for a checkup.
Something about a diet.
Then you have a pretty full schedule till noontime.
A diet, huh?
Oh, all right.
Oh, would you take these glasses down to the optometrist down the hall?
The lens keeps popping out on me, and I'm so nearsighted, I can't see a thing without 'em.
I'll be right back, Doctor.
Yes.
Yes.
Excuse me.
There's no one outside, and I have an appointment.
- I'm Herman Munster.
- Oh, yes.
My nurse just stepped down the hall.
Uh, come in.
I'm Doctor Dudley.
How do you do?
Well, Mr. Munster, I see you brought your doggie.
I'm afraid he'll have to wait outside unless he's had his shots.
I'm afraid you don't understand.
I'm here for an examination.
I have some weight to lose in a hurry.
Oh, yes.
You're the gentleman.
Who wants the diet.
Well, my nurse just took my glasses to be repaired, and, uh I could come back later.
No need.
No need.
It's just a routine physical.
I could do it blindfolded.
Now, if you just sit down over here, I'll look you over.
Now, stick out your tongue.
Doc?
Oh, there you are.
You mustn't be afraid of me.
Now, have, uh, you ever had the measles?
Chicken pox?
Or the mumps?
Or severe dizziness or headaches?
No.
Just the Black Plague.
Black Plague?
Very funny.
Something wrong?
No, no.
That's what I get for buying this equipment from my brother-in-law.
Now, have, uh have you had your appendix or, uh, tonsils or gallbladder or spleen removed?
No, not since they were first put in.
Quite a comedian, aren't ya?
Sixty-two point eight?
Why, that's incredible!
Oh, not really.
I always run a little fever when I'm nervous.
Well, you mustn't be nervous.
And now I'll take your pulse.
Now, look, I told you once you got to get the dog out of here!
Scoot!
Scoot!
Doc, that's my hand.
Y-You mean you were born with this?
No, someone else was.
And I'll always be grateful.
Not everyone will give you a hand when you need one.
If you're gonna make me laugh, we'll be here all day.
Now, if you'll just step over here to the scale, Mr. Munster.
Doc, I hate to contradict you, but the scale is over here.
Oh, I'm sorry.
The woman that dusts for me keeps moving my things.
Now, if you'll just step up here.
Where's the nurse with those glasses?
Well, shall we check the old tick-tick-ticker?
Keep the best for the last.
Mr. Munster, now, if you'll just sit down here.
That That-a-boy.
Here we go.
You know, I just discovered something extraordinary.
I can't hear a thing without my glasses.
Doc How silly of me.
You ought to be a doctor.
There we are.
Comin' in good.
Doc, I think there's someone at the door.
You're right.
Excuse me.
Here are your glasses, Doctor.
Thank you, Nurse.
She's pretty but poky.
Well, shall we, uh, push on, Mr. Munster?
Is there a doctor in the house?
Lily?
Grandpa?
Lily?
Oh.
Listen to this.
It's from the doctor.
What were the results of your examination?
"Dear Mr. Munster, "I have studied the results of your examination "and have reached the following conclusions: "Your pulse is 15; your blood pressure is minus three; body temperature, 62.8; and heartbeat, none".
So far, so good.
"Furthermore, it is my duty as a physician to warn you that unless you go on the enclosed diet and lose 100 pounds immediately, you'll be dead in a week".
- But if I'm dead, I can't go to the reunion.
- Well, I don't know.
That never stopped me from going anywhere.
I'm gonna lose a hundred pounds and go to the reunion in uniform even if it kills me.
Herman, lunch.
I don't know how he's done it.
Six days on nothing but vitamins and water.
I didn't think he'd really be able to stick to it this long.
Herman.
Hurry up.
Your lunch is getting cold.
Mmm.
Looks delicious.
And what have we here?
Vitamins and water.
Oh, Lily.
Oh.
And a B-12 too.
Lily, you shouldn't have gone to so much trouble.
Delicious.
Would you pass    I never knew you could get indigestion from water.
Has anybody got a toothpick?
Enough is enough!
You win.
Go to the reunion.
Just don't wear your uniform.
But please, eat something.
No!
Now it's become a matter of principle.
And besides, I've just got four more days to go.
Four more days.
You'll never make it.
Never make it.
Aha!
Grandpa!
What are you doing hanging around down here?
What am I doing?
What are you doing?
- I thought I heard a burglar.
- Of course.
And you thought you'd find him in the refrigerator.
Herman, put yourself in my place and look at the diet from a sensible position.
No.
I've only got two more days to go, and I've got to get to that reunion.
For your own good, take my advice.
Listen to someone whose head is not always in the clouds.
Eat something already.
No.
Now it's become a matter of principle.
I'm gonna see it through!
You'll never make it.
You'll never make it!
Good night.
And please stop that noise.
I'm trying to get some sleep.
Oh, come on, Uncle Herman.
Eat something.
Please?
Look.
Today is my last day.
I'm gonna make it.
Tomorrow's the reunion.
You'll never last.
You'll eat before the day is up.
Oh, no, I won't.
Tonight at dinner, can I have his drumstick?
We'll see, dear.
- Drumstick?
- Yeah.
Today's Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving?
I told you he wouldn't make it.
You mean, Thanksgiving with turkey and cranberry sauce?
That kind ofThanksgiving?
Yeah, that's the kind with the dressing and the mashed potatoes and the gravy.
With the dressing and the mashed potatoes and the gravy And the pickled beets and the mushrooms and the candied yams.
With the pickled beets and the mushrooms, the candied yams And the olives and the celery stuffed with Roquefort cheese.
Olives, the celery stuffed with Roquefort cheese.
And the homemade biscuits oozing with melted butter.
Homemade biscuits oozing with melted butter And don't forget the pumpkin pie!
Pumpkin pie  Oh!
He fainted!
Oh!
Oh, Herman.
Herman.
Oh.
Oh, Herman.
I'll call the doctor.
Oh, are you all right, pussycat?
He's right in here, Doctor.
Thank you.
I didn't like the look of him when he was in my office last week.
Didn't like the looks of his doggie either.
A little on the mangy side.
Well, I don't know what you're talking about, Doctor, but I do think you ought to examine him.
All right.
We'll have a look here.
What are you doing, Doctor?
I hate to say this, but, uh, you called me a little too late.
There's nothing more I can do.
What do you mean?
This is just a fainting spell.
He's had these before.
Well, eight or nine times in the last 100 years!
I'm very sorry.
Now, if you'll just help me fill out this form for the authorities, I won't intrude on you any longer.
Now, was he a resident of the country over six months?
Well, yes, but Did he serve in the armed forces?
Of course, Doctor, but what How many years?
Three years, but Three years.
Four years.
Four years.
What was that?
I said it was four years.
Don't you remember, Lily?
The first year I was at Fort Benning.
Then I went overseas.
And then I was transferred to that outfit   That doctor is ill.
He shouldn't be allowed around sick people.
Lily, what happened?
The last thing I remember is something about pumpkin pie.
It's all right, Herman.
You just fainted.
That silly doctor thought you were dead.
What a ridiculous mistake.
I may be starving to death, but I'm the picture of health.
Just the same, this diet has gone far enough.
No reunion is worth it.
No.
I've only got Lily, only 24 hours.
And I'm gonna make it.
All I need is a little something to hold me through the day.
Herman, I think I have just the thing that will hold you.
That oughta hold you.
Thanks a lot.
I knew I could depend on you.
This reunion must be awfully important to you, Herman.
Are you sure this is the way you want it?
Lily, it's the only way.
Well, Herman, we have to go now.
We thought we'd eat our Thanksgiving dinner out.
That way, you won't be bothered by the smell of food.
- Can you see the TV set all right, Uncle Herman?
- Fine.
Fine.
- You sure you'll be all right?
- Oh, sure.
Just go out and enjoy yourselves.
Have a hearty meal.
Bon appétit.
Well, good-bye, Herman.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good-bye, Eddie.
Good night, dear.
Good night.
Good-bye, Uncle Herman.
Good night, Marilyn.
Don't worry about me.
I'll be just fine.
Hmph!
Big deal.
A turkey dinner.
Who needs it, anyway?
That was a program of dinner music coming to you from the Gourmet Room Iocated in the heart of Eaton, Pennsylvania.
And now, a word from our sponsor.
Are you in the market for a Thanksgiving dinner with all the trimmings?
The phone our send-home department, and within an hour, on your table, a hot turkey dinner the finest of succulent white meat, the tastiest drumsticks, the spiciest of stuffings, all smothered in a deep, rich brown gravy.
Then top off this delectable repast with a delicious slice of   In a sea of hot fudge sauce   Ah!
Here we are!
Look at that bird.
Mother, you've outdone yourself this time.
Just put it down and let me get started on it.
May we be truly thankful for what we're about to receive.
Now, let's see.
What does everybody want?
Oh, this cuts beautifully.
Turkey.
Mmm!
Mmm!
Mmm.
Delicious!
Mmm.
Boy.
Mashed potatoes.
Mashed potatoes.
Oh, will you pass the brussels sprouts, please?
Mmm.
That's good.
And this turkey is delicious.
!
Did you make the dressing yourself?
Delicious!
Oh, would you give my wife the recipe?
Where is the cranberry sauce?
Uh, would someone pass me the cranberry sauce?
What's a Thanksgiving without cranberry sauce?
Will you pass the cranberry sauce?
I want some cranberry sauce!
Where's Herman?
He's up in the attic trying on his uniform.
That's right.
Tonight's the reunion of his old army outfit.
Boy, the way he ate last night, he'll never get into that uniform!
It was very nice of Mrs. Farber not to send for the police after the way Herman acted.
Mrs. Farber was very understanding.
As a matter of fact, she said whenever her husband goes on a diet, he acts hardly human.
Becomes a regular fiend.
Not only did Herman eat their entire dinner but he even brought home the cranberry sauce in a doggie bag.
Gee, Dad, you look great!
Thank you, son.
There certainly is something about a soldier.
I never thought I'd be saying good-bye to you again in uniform.
Lily, it's just one night, you know.
I'm not going overseas.
What's this?
Just my ribs, that's all.
Let's see.
Uh It's a bulletproof vest.
"Bulletproof vest".
That's Grandma's old corset.
Well, I admit it's not strictly G.I., but that cranberry sauce sure puts weight on ya!
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Eddie's flunked science.
What?
I can't believe it.
Eddie's always had it up here.
Well, it's about time we gave it to him down here.
I was just in his room, and I found these letters from his school principal, Mr. Balding.
Three of them!
Obviously, he's been hiding them.
I can't understand it.
We've never given him any reason to be afraid of us.
That's true, Lily.
I tell ya.
I'm very concerned.
I haven't been so shocked since the last time I sat in Grandpa's chair.
What are we gonna do?
Well, I think we'll have to go right down to that school and find out what's going on.
There's nothing better at a time like this than meeting face-to-face.
Oh, Taggert, don't you think you're being a trifle too harsh on the boy?
In my professional opinion, Eddie Munster should be expelled.
I think you're going too far, Taggert.
After all, this is a grammar school.
You're not a prison guard anymore.
If you'd use a few more of my methods, you'd have less trouble with some of your inmates.
I mean, pupils.
Look, Taggert.
I don't care if your brother-in-law is a member of the Board of Education.
I am running this school, not you!
Now, there could be a perfectly good reason why the Munsters haven't answered my letters.
Hmph.
That's exactly what Dillinger's principal said.
All right.
What do you suggest we should do about it?
You leave it to me.
I'm going out to their house and throw a good scare into those Munsters.
Eddie, why didn't you show us these notes from your teacher?
I guess I didn't want you to know I was failing science, sir.
I can't understand it.
Don't you want to follow in your father's tracks?
Young man, I think we're just gonna have to suspend some of your privileges.
No more standing in the closet, no more sleeping in Spot's cage, and from now on every night, you're gonna have to go to bed while it's still dark.
Isn't that a little severe, Herman?
Why, you're-you're positively inhuman.
Grandpa, please.
Young man, I'm laying down the law.
You're supposed to have a project ready for the science fair.
Where is it?
Well, you see, it's No excuses!
I want you to start right away on that project, and I mean right now!
What's so funny?
It's-It's this joke book.
Listen to this one, Lily.
It'll kill ya.
Well, it's a little late for that but go ahead.
"I just invented something to keep the inside of my car quiet.
It fits right over her mouth".
And if you think that one's funny, listen to this.
"Two men are walking" Why do you like to read that silly joke book?
It's not silly.
Besides, it's very important nowadays to have a sense of humor.
Now, I even noticed it down at the parlor.
During lunch, the guys are always sitting around laughing and joking.
As soon as I walk over, they stop.
Speaking of work, you'd better get going.
You'll be late again.
I guess you're right.
They're starting to call me "the late Herman Munster".
Besides, I've gotta take two hours off today to go down and visit Eddie's principal.
Uh, by the way, where is Eddie anyway?
He's still down in the laboratory working on his science project.
Okay, Eddie, get the head, and we'll put it on.
?
?
You know, Eddie, this is turning out to be the finest robot we've ever made.
Boy, I sure hope it brings my marks up when I enter it in the science fair at school.
I'm certain it will.
You've worked hard enough on it.
Grandpa helped me.
No, no, I didn't.
I merely supervised.
You know, Marilyn, this boy has a naturally mechanical mind.
?
?
I've been trying to get away from the shop all morning.
But it looks as though I won't be able to make it.
We're just too busy.
People are dying to get in here.
I think it's because of our new layaway plan.
Do you want me to cancel the appointment, Uncle Herman?
No.
No, no, no, no.
The school would think we're not reliable.
- Ask your Aunt Lily to go.
- Aunt Lily's not here.
She's gone to the dentist to have her teeth filed.
How about Grandpa going instead?
Now, you know Grandpa never goes out in the daytime.
- How would it be if I went?
- Oh, would you, dear?
Oh, that would be very nice of you.
?
?
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
I have to go now.
They're-They're starting.
That's all right, Uncle Herman.
We all have to go sometime.
Bye.
Oh, you run along to class, Eddie.
I'm going in to talk to your principal.
Okay, but I don't think it'll do any good.
Well, it doesn't hurt to try.
Oh, see you later.
And don't be afraid.
He's kind of scary.
Come in, please.
Good afternoon.
Are you Eddie Munster's father?
No, I'm his grandfather.
At your service.
Well, I'm Taggert, juvenile investigator for the Board of Education.
Came here to check up on Eddie Munster  Environment-wise, that is.
Well, you see, Eddie's parents are not here, but I would be glad to show you around.
In all my life, I never saw a house in this condition.
Thank you.
Yes, it is hard to believe that my daughter does this all by herself.
Just follow me, Mr. Taggert.
This is the living room.
Cozy, isn't it?
- You call this cozy.
- Oh, yeah!
Chow time!
Excuse me.
I have to go and feed the clock.
?
?
More?
Nevermore.
Don't worry, cutie pie.
I haven't forgotten you.
Excuse me.
?
?
?
?
Come and get it!
He has an amazing appetite for a goldfish.
Eddie was just too ashamed to show us your letters.
I was beginning to think no one in your family cared.
Oh, no.
We were all especially disappointed to hear he was failing science.
"Especially"?
You see, my whole family is very interested in science.
My grandfather even has a laboratory in the basement.
Then I can't understand why his science work in school should be so poor.
Well, I guess Eddie was just spending too much time working on his project for the science fair.
It's a robot.
A robot?
Eh?
Well, what do you think?
This is my laboratory, where I, uh, work on some of my experiments.
What are these restraining straps for?
Well, some of my experiments don't like it.
Wait'll you see this!
?
?
- What is that?
- That's Eddie's robot.
- He made it all by himself.
- It's nothing but a pile of tin cans succotash, baked beans, Harvard beets.
It's amazing what you can do with leftovers.
You wanna see how it works?
Never mind!
L I don't care whether it works or not.
Any boy who comes from an environment like this has no place in our school system.
After meeting me and visiting Eddie's home, you're throwing him out of school?
That is my recommendation.
Sic 'im!
Oh, yeah?
Keep that thing away from me!
Help!
Help!
Good boy!
After talking with you, I feel Mr. Taggert may have been a little hasty.
My aunt and uncle will be so glad to hear you're giving Eddie a second chance.
Well, any boy interested enough in science to build a robot deserves a second chance.
Thanks again, Mr. Balding.
Oh, uh, the youngsters are bringing their projects to the science fair tonight.
Be sure Eddie has his robot there.
My family and I will see you then.
Good.
I'll be looking forward to seeing them face-to-face.
Good grief, Taggert!
Don't tell me you've become a beatnik at your age.
I have just come from the Munsters' house, and I was lucky to escape with my life.
Any boy who comes from that background has got to be a delinquent.
You should see the boy's grandfather.
He looks like a fatJack the Ripper!
Taggert, this is not a reform school.
We can't expel every student you don't like.
There wouldn't be anyone here but the janitor.
Eddie Munster is really different.
Oh, nonsense.
His cousin was right here in my office, and she's a charming, lovely person.
And she convinced me to give the boy a second chance.
Say, "Ah".
Come on!
Say, "Ah".
Ahhh.
Oh!
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
I didn't know you had company.
E-Excuse me.
That's not company.
That's Eddie's robot!
How do you do?
That's amazing.
If the top of his head was a little flatter, he'd look positively human.
I've seen that robot.
It's not only a piece of junk, it's a menace to society.
It's got a flat head.
Now, that is a sure sign of a criminal type.
I'll see it for myself tonight.
And, Taggert, if you're lying, it's your job.
You're forgetting my brother-in-law's a member of the Board of Education.
I don't care if your father's the governor.
The only job security I have left is to make sure that robot don't work.
Sometimes I wish I'd stayed a prison guard.
You meet a better class of people.
Oh, dear, they've already started.
I knew we'd be late.
Herman, if you hadn't spent so much time reading that joke book, we could've been here an hour ago.
Sorry, dear.
But you know how hard it is to put a book down in the middle of a joke.
Herman, we'll take the robot backstage.
You go and park the car.
Aha!
So we meet again!
Sic 'im!
Oh, no.
Wait a minute!
L-I want to apologize.
- I was a bit hasty today.
- That's different.
After seeing the robot, I realized that Eddie must come from a very unusual family.
Thank you.
Yes, this is, uh, certainly a very handsome, uh, piece of work.
Uh, Mr. Taggert, are you attending the science fair?
No, I want to go over Eddie's records.
I want to make sure he gets, uh, exactly what's coming to him.
Thank you.
Start her up, Eddie.
Let's give it a trial run.
What happened?
That's the first time I've ever seen a robot with indigestion.
?
?
That was little Andrea Sue Blum, Class Two, B-4, reading her composition, "What Einstein's Theory of Relativity Means to Me".
Something wrong?
It's the robot, Uncle Herman.
It's not working.
- Eddie, try it again.
-  I think it's the carburetor.
The only answer is an emergency carburetorectomy.
Help me get this into the dressing room.
Next is MasterJules Daly, Class Four, A-3, with his own invention, electric chopsticks.
?
?
Grandpa, you think you'll be finished on time?
They'll be calling for Eddie soon.
- Why don't you just take the robot - Herman, please.
I didn't interfere when you were being put together.
Ready?
Ready.
Ready.
Can opener.
Can opener.
Can opener.
Pliers.
Pliers.
Pliers.
What's the matter with him?
You know how squeamish Herman is.
He always faints at the sight of oil.
Rivet.
Rivet.
Rivet.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The last exhibit on our science fair tonight will be a robot built by young Eddie Munster.
!
Oh, Grandpa!
They're introducing the robot right now.
What'll we do?
Lily, please!
I mean, these things take time.
After all, I'm only flesh and blood.
Somebody will just have to go out there and stall them until we're ready, like they do in those old Don Ameche movies on TV.
But who?
Is it over yet?
L I have no idea what's holding things up, but I'm sure he'll be right out.
The robot, please!
Stall them?
Yes!
How?
Just talk to them.
Talk to them?
Oh, I couldn't.
I'd-I'd be scared to death.
I'd-I'd get stage fright.
What could I say?
Why don't you tell them some of those jokes you've been reading in that book?
- That ought to keep them amused.
- Now, Herman, this could be your big break.
Go out there and give them everything you've got!
Why, just think, Herman.
This could mean Hollywood The Palace!
- Come on, dear.
- All right.
I'll go out there.
But I'm not doing this for fame or fortune  Or to be the life of the party.
I'm doing this for Eddie.
And here it is now!
Uh.
I've been asked to come out here and, uh, entertain you.
Amazing!
It looks almost alive.
Alice, why can't our Sydney build something like that?
He's 16 years old, and he can barely wave bye-bye.
Oh, George!
Uh Uh, ladies and gentlemen.
Um, uh-uh, this is my first public appearance.
So, you'll have to bear with me if I don't function too well.
As a matter of fact, this situation reminds me of a story.
One time, Abraham Lincoln was asked if he found appearing at public ceremonies annoying.
He said, "Yes.
"In fact, I feel like the man who was ridden out of town on a rail who said, "If it wasn't for the honor of the thing, I'd rather walk".
'   I think I've found the trouble.
Someone has thrown a wrench in the works.
Who would do a thing like that?
Taggert!
And they even have an invention for keeping the inside of the car quiet.
It fits right over her mouth.
I'll be right back.
?
?
Whew!
"Did you take a bath?
'" And the kid said, "No.
'" Well, that's as much as I can do.
Now it's all up to that big mechanic in the sky.
Who wears the biggest hat in the world?
The man with the biggest head.
?
?
?
?
Ca-Can we bring it out now?
Of course!
All we have to do is get Herman off the stage.
Come on.
Careful, Grandpa.
Feet.
Careful.
?
?
More!
That was great work, Herman.
But you can stop now.
- The robot's fixed.
- Stop now?
Are you kidding?
You hear 'em out there?
I'm a smash.
I tell you.
They're my kind of people.
They love me out there.
I got 'em right in the palm of my hand.
Herman Munster.
!
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
Aren't you forgetting something?
This is supposed to be Eddie's night, not yours.
But, Lily, l  Lily, I guess you're right.
I'm just a big ham.
It was the lights and the applause.
L I just got carried away.
Eddie, do you hear that out there?
More.
!
More.
!
More.
!
That's for you.
Now, take your robot and go on out there and kill 'em!
- Herman!
- Lily, that's just a show business expression.
Okay, Eddie.
Start her up now.
I'm sorry, Eddie.
I've let you down.
It's all my fault.
What am I going to do?
There's nothing to do.
I'll just go out and explain.
No, Dad, that's my job.
No!
Eddie just informed me his robot exploded backstage.
However-However, I think I speak for everyone here when I say the special prize should still go to Eddie Munster.
Yeah!
Really?
Eddie tells me he doesn't deserve to win.
He was helped by his grandfather.
You know, I think such honesty should be rewarded.
Eddie, my young friend, you're the kind of a boy we're proud to have in our school.
I agree.
!
I think our Eddie has just become a man!
And the hard way, not like you, Herman.
That's our boy.
Where's Eddie?
And where's my joke book?
I haven't seen it.
And Eddie's down in the lab.
He and Grandpa are working on a new project.
Another invention?
It's got something to do with the robot.
Hmph.
It's remarkable how that boy's marks have improved.
He's liable to turn out just like me if he keeps his head to the grindstone.
I'm so glad to hear they sent that awful Mr. Taggert back to prison service.
It's men like him who give prisons a bad name.
"Why does a chicken cross the road"?
To get on the other side.
That was good, Eddie.
Good.
Try another one.
"Why do firemen wear red suspenders"?
To keep their pants up.
Eddie, we'll make a fortune.
They say vaudeville is dead, but you and I, we're gonna bring it back to life.
Yuk, yuk, yuk.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Now, Wilbur, I'll show you something special.
There you go, Wilbur.
Gee, thanks, Mr. Munster.
Well, Eddie, I, uh, can't sit around here tying knots all day.
The car has a flat, and I promised Grandpa I'd hold it up while he changes the tire.
Good-bye, Wilbur.
Good-bye, sir.
Boy, Eddie, you got the neatest father in the whole neighborhood.
Jerry, look.
If we can sign up this guy, Herman Munster, we'll have the greatest gimmick in wrestling since the Swedish Angel.
Yeah.
Why, he ties knots in steel bars.
A-A-And lifts automobiles off the ground.
Mm-hmm.
No, his kid goes to school with my Wilbur.
No, I haven't met him yet, but believe me, when he climbs into the ring, he'll have the people falling in the aisles.
Oh.
This Chinese tea always acts up when we put it in the Russian samovar.
That certainly was a very nice dinner you served tonight, Lily.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Oh, the soup was delicious.
But the croutons kept crawling out of the bowl.
Don't worry about that, Grandpa.
They always come back.
Lily, uh, uh, did you read this article?
It says here that 35% of the parents who want to send their children to college don't have the money when the time comes.
Oh, that shouldn't worry us now, Herman.
Eddie won't be ready for college for a long time yet.
No, but it says we should start planning now.
Set a little bit aside every year.
Back in the Old Country, we always buried a little something in the backyard for a rainy day.
You know, Eddie should go to college.
After all, his father was a college man.
How long were you at the Heidelburg University, dear?
How long?
I was in their medical school for six years in several different jars.
Yes, Lily, your husband was a man of parts.
You know, we've got to send Eddie to college, even if it means I have to borrow the money.
Telephone.
What?
The telephone in the hall?
It's about to ring.
Why wait till the last minute?
Oh.
Thank you, Grandpa.
Hello?
Mr. Ramsey?
Wilbur's father.
Mr. Munster, I have a proposition to make you.
Really?
A proposition?
I hope that's not another salesman on the phone, trying to sell cemetery plots.
We have enough trouble making the payments on this place without thinking of resort property.
Well, I could, uh, use the $200 or $300 extra a week, but wrestling?
My goodness.
What would my family and friends think?
If it's your friends and family you're worried about, nobody has to know.
We'll put a hood over your head and bill you as The Masked Marvel.
It'll be a great gimmick.
The Masked Marvel?
Uh, you mean, nobody could see my face?
Well, I sure could use the money.
Uh, I just might go for it.
Uh, listen, Mr. Ramsey.
Just give me a few days to get in shape, and I'll get in touch with you.
Mum's the word, now.
Bye.
He ties knots in steel bars and needs to get in shape?
Our problems are solved.
When you grow up, you're gonna go to college after all.
Oh, isn't that wonderful.
Now maybe you'll grow up to be half the man your father is.
Oh, boy!
You're gonna be your daddy's big, smart, successful son.
Gee, Dad, do it again.
Will ya?
Huh?
There goes Uncle Herman with that pounding again.
I wish he'd tell us what he's doing down there in the lab.
He's been spending most of his time down there now for three days.
He won't even let me in.
He says he's just in training for his new job.
I wonder what he meant when he said it's night work.
There's only one decent kind of night work I know of, and I haven't done any since I left the Old Country.
Ah, for the good old days on the graveyard shift.
There he goes again.
Hmph!
Igor, will you go away?
Can't you see I'm busy?
It's not Igor, Herman.
It's me.
I just had to fly down here to see what you're up to.
Grandpa, don't you know that curiosity killed the bat?
But satisfaction brought him back.
Oh, wrestling.
Now, this is the night work you've been coming down here training for.
Grandpa, I didn't want anyone to know.
Some promoter's offered me $300 a week if I'll appear as The Masked Marvel.
The Masked Marvel?
You, a wrestler?
You won't even draw flies.
Oh, on the contrary, I'm sure I will.
But why you?
Of all people, lowering the Munster dignity.
Because I want my son to go to college.
I misjudged you, Herman.
But don't worry.
I won't tell anyone your secret.
Shh.
Thank you, Grandpa.
Thank you.
Uh, but now I gotta be sure I'm in shape.
I'm due in the arena tonight.
I guess I'd better quit.
I don't wanna overtrain.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the featured match of the evening on our all-star wrestling card, presenting on my left, at 270 pounds, standing 6 foot 4, our local champion, Tarzan McGirk.
And as his opponent tonight, Tarzan takes on a newcomer, weighing 387 pounds, a mystery mangler The Masked Marvel!
Your referee for the main event this evening will be TigerJoe Marsh.
Uh, how do you do?
Pleased to meet you.
- Huh?
- Back to your corners.
All right, here we go.
Tarzan McGirk, The Masked Marvel.
Okay, wrestle!
Grandpa, do we have to watch wrestling?
Well, I just thought wrestling might be nice for a change.
Yeah, leave it on.
Wrestling's my favorite show.
They begin to circle one another as each looks for an opening.
Uh-oh, Tarzan McGirk clamps on his famous headlock.
Yes, there's action here tonight.
Hey, that Tarzan guy's neat.
He always plays the good guy.
But that other fellow with the mask, he's so much bigger.
Working hard at it.
Oh, oh!
The sleeping giant has come to life!
Look at that big bully.
Come on, Tarzan.
Don't let him do that.
The Masked Marvel is really mad.
He has completely dominated the match.
Here we go.
And just look at him go at Tarzan McGirk!
No!
No!
Come on!
No!
Boo!
Boo!
McGirk goes down again!
He's such a brute.
I can't watch.
What's he doing?
The back vault!
Wow!
Ladies and gentlemen, now The Masked Marvel is really mad.
Oh, oh.
Doesn't look as though he has a chance.
The Masked Marvel is really something.
This is the match of the century.
I'm certainly glad that Masked Marvel got the worst of it.
I am too.
They shouldn't let a big bully like that in the ring.
McGirk won.
I can't understand it.
I do, Grandpa.
I think the bad guy was supposed to win.
But that Masked Marvel's so dumb, he forgot he was the bad guy and let that good guy win.
Oh, well, I'm not feeling so well.
I think I'll take a ride in the car.
Yeah, and on the way home, I'll pick up Herman from work.
Grandpa, couldn't you just give us a little hint about what kind of work he's in?
L-I'm sorry, Lily.
I can't.
But I can tell you this though.
That boy is sure starting at the bottom.
I can't understand it, Herman.
I saw the match on television.
I haven't seen such a dive since I was forced down by a vulture over Transylvania.
Grandpa, I just couldn't help myself.
Every time I got Tarzan McGirk down on the mat, he talked to me.
Talked to you?
Yeah.
Well, I didn't have the heart to beat him.
Do you know that he's supporting four children?
And that his wife's sister is living with them?
And that he has to send his sick grandmother in Ireland money for medical expenses?
What kind of medical expenses?
Oh, it's pathetic.
She's too poor to afford a doctor, so every week she buys nine dollars worth of moldy bread and makes her own penicillin.
Oh, boy!
And for this you threw the fight!
I didn't throw the fight.
L-I just couldn't be mean to McGirk after he told me all his troubles.
He's really a very nice man.
His troubles?
What about your troubles?
Eddie's education is at stake.
You've gotta climb into that ring, son, not as Herman Munster but as every proud father fighting for his little boy.
This is not just a wrestling match.
This is a shining crusade.
A contest on the battlefield of life that will leave you a stronger and nobler person.
Really?
Of course.
The next bum comes along, get in there and kick him in the teeth!
Boy, you should have been here last night, Pop.
We watched wrestling on television.
Yes, Herman, they had some big awful bully called The Masked Marvel.
Yeah, he was clobbering some guy smaller than him, but then The Masked Marvel turned chicken and rolled over on his back.
I've never seen anything like it, Uncle Herman.
Yeah, Pop, you should have been here to see that big dope coward.
Yeah, yeah, I should have been here.
Well, how could he be here?
He was away working on his new job.
That's right.
I can't be in two places at once anymore.
Herman, I've been looking up colleges for Eddie, for when he grows up, and I wanna go over them with you.
Please, Lily.
Let's just see how the new job works out before we decide on a school.
Herman's right.
One thing at a time.
You know the old saying: No sense in putting the hearse before the horse.
I tell ya if I lose this match, my son has to drop out of med school.
Uh, good heavens, man!
Why didn't you tell me?
Break it up!
I said break it up!
But if they repossess my sister's banjo, she'll be kicked out of the Boston Symphony.
Really?
L-I had no idea.
But I've gotta get my kid brother the plane fare to Africa.
Albert Schweitzer needs him.
Hey, boss, when you gonna dump this Munster guy?
He's lost eight matches in a row.
Even the crowd's getting tired of booing him.
Look, Jerry, I've got one more gimmick that might appeal to the fans.
Beginning tonight, I'm offering $50 a minute to any cluck from the audience for as long as he can stay in the ring with The Masked Marvel.
Uh, what is it I'm supposed to do again, Mr. Hansen?
Strangler, you saw the sign outside.
Fifty bucks a minute for any amateur who stays in the ring with this guy.
Well, tonight, you walk up like any schnook from the audience and toss him around for about 25 minutes.
Yeah, but, uh, this guy's pretty big.
What if I can't handle him?
Well, how did you handle the other guys uh, Iron Man Mallory, Benny Sampson and Charlie the Choker?
You put sleeping pills in their drinking water.
Okay.
So tonight I do the same thing to The Masked Marvel.
I'm gonna dump this whole bottle in the water cooler in his dressing room.
He'll be so groggy, your biggest problem will be keeping him awake during the match.
You're sure a smart fella, Mr. Hansen.
But ain't this just a little bit dishonest?
Fifty dollars a minute.
We walk out with 1,250 bucks.
I withdraws the question.
Oh, Eddie, you're not going to turn on wrestling again tonight.
I don't think I can watch that Masked Marvel one more time.
He's nothing but a bully and a coward, and he loses all the time.
I know, but the paper says it's amateur night.
I just wanna watch this one match.
Who knows?
The big dope might win this time.
Ladies and gentlemen, a nonprofessional from the audience, Mr. John Smith versus The Masked Marvel for $50 a minute.
Boy, this is gonna be good tonight.
I hope Grandpa gets back in time to see it.
The Masked Marvel and the challenger from the audience.
Wait a minute, Eddie.
Isn't that Grandpa there?
Well, it is.
!
I didn't know Grandpa was this interested in wrestling.
It looks like the battle of titans here tonight, folks.
This is really a match, folks.
Wow!
He may be an amateur, but if he ever manages to sit on that Masked Marvel, the match will be over.
Wow, thatJohn Smith is murdering him.
Look at that big oaf.
He's not even fighting back.
Come on, Herman.
Don't let him do that.
Stay with it, Strangler.
Strangler?
Now, Herman, what kind of a sob story did this guy tell you?
You're letting him kill you.
Who's letting him?
I can hardly see him.
I'm so sleepy, I can barely stand up.
That That smarts!
Marilyn, doesn't that sound like Herman?
Yes, it does, Aunt Lily.
Hey, that is Daddy.
Heavens to betsy.
This This must be the night work he's been doing.
Come on, Pop.
Clobber 'im!
Come on, Uncle Herman.
Don't let him do that to you.
Come on.
Don't let him do that!
Hit him!
Come on!
Come on, Murphy!
Give it to him, Strangler.
The pills are working.
We got it made!
Murphy?
Strangler?
You mean that's Strangler Murphy, who was suspended in Chicago for bringing tire chains into the ring?
No.
It just spilled out.
That's John Smith, that's who it is.
So, you brought a ringer in, huh?
That's Strangler Murphy!
He's no amateur.
It's a frame-up!
Uh-oh, what's Grandpa gonna do?
I don't know, but he better do it quick.
You wanna play games?
I'll show you how to play games.
Abracadabra, acey-docey, alakazam and Bela Lugosi!
Boss, we gotta stop the fight.
Are you kidding?
No, no, no.
There's a fire broke out in the storage room out back.
Al and the boys are trying to put it out.
Look.
This is the best attraction we ever had.
Tell 'em to close the fire door.
That oughta hold it back till the fight's over.
But, Duke Go do it, will you?
Bombs away, Herman!
Hey, Munster!
We got a little fire out in back.
Really?
Yeah, yeah.
You gotta make an announcement to clear the arena.
I'll I'll try.
Good.
Ladies and gentlemen, you must leave.
Uh Uh, you see uh Was that quick enough for you, Mr. Ramsey?
Mr Mr. Ramsey?
Mr. Ramsey?
Mr. Ramsey?
"Last night at the Meadow Brook Stadium, "a newcomer to the wrestling game, Herman Munster, "persuaded a capacity crowd to clear the building in five seconds flat, "thus preventing a panic, when a small fire was discovered backstage.
"Fire Chief Davenport has awarded Mr. Munster the city's annual $1,000 Fire Safety Award for his heroic action".
Oh, that's wonderful, Uncle Herman!
You must have done some quick thinking, dear.
I don't really remember too much about it.
I was kind of groggy at the time.
I guess in the emergency, I just said the right thing.
And you really clobbered that other wrestler, Pop.
You're the bravest guy in the whole world.
Thank you, Eddie.
Uh, but, Eddie, I did it all for you.
And that thousand dollars is going in our vault as a beginning on your college fund.
Gee, thanks, Pop.
You're swell.
Toss me up in the air again, will ya?
All righty.
Up we go!
Oh, don't worry, Herman.
Have your hotcakes.
He'll be down before breakfast is over.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Morning, dear.
Well, finally.
His Majesty has condescended to grace us with his presence.
Be seated.
Please, Lily, spare me the jokes.
Today's starting out to be one of those days.
Good morning, Uncle Herman.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning!
Morning, Grandpa.
Mmm.
What smells so good?
I cut myself shaving.
Front door.
I'll get it.
No, dear.
Uh, not the way you're dressed.
I'll get it.
You can never tell when Mr. Right is gonna come along.
If you go to the door looking like that, you're liable to scare him off.
Front door.
Well, bless me.
If it isn't Herman.
Oh, no.
Charlie.
I knew it was gonna be one of those days.
Ah, Lily.
Herman's twin brother.
Charlie, it's good to see you.
Lily, you look just wonderful, my dear.
A lot of people would just die to have a complexion like that.
Don't tell me.
This is little Eddie.
The last time I saw you, my boy, you were this high.
Ah, Marilyn.
Don't you look pretty, uh, uh, pretty How do you do in school, dear?
Just fine, Uncle Charlie.
Good, good, good.
And now, Uncle Charlie has a little something for each of you.
Now, let me see.
What have I got here?
Eddie, this is for you.
Oh, boy, a bat in the box!
Thank you, Uncle Charlie.
And Lily, this is for you.
Oh, Charlie!
A new shroud!
Oh!
Ooh.
A girl can never have enough of these.
Marilyn, this here's for you.
Oh.
Greatest thing in the world for warts.
Don't worry, Grandpa.
Old Charlie hasn't forgotten you.
Good.
Oh.
Oh!
It's a box of cigars.
And the box, you see, is a great place to keep your ashes.
But, uh, tell me, where's Herman?
He can't still be nursing a grudge against his own twin brother.
Of course not, Charlie.
He loves you.
He'll be right down.
Oh, no, he won't.
What's in the other suitcase, Uncle Charlie?
That?
That, Marilyn, my dear, is a little invention that is going to make your Uncle Charlie a million dollars.
"A million dollars'"?
Oh, an invention.
By the way, I happen to be a bit of an inventor myself.
Do you mind if I take a look at it?
Delighted.
Oh.
What does it do, Uncle Charlie?
It extracts uranium from seawater.
"Extracts uranium from seawater"?
I don't believe it.
If you will allow me Marilyn, please.
I'll show you how it works.
See?
Good old everyday garden variety seawater.
It contains .
047 grains of uranium.
Now, let me see here.
I turn the machine on.
Now I add the water.
Oh!
Is that really uranium?
There's one sure way to find out.
I'll fly down to my laboratory and get my Geiger counter.
Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, Grandpa, don't do that.
It's not necessary.
I mean, I have my own.
I always carry a Geiger counter with me.
You'll make a fortune.
Why, do you realize that uranium is worth its weight in gold?
Well, what do you know?
Well It's getting late.
I'd better find me a hotel.
Say "how do you do" to Herman for me.
Funny.
I have a feeling that boy's been avoiding me.
- You're darn right I am.
- You're going to stay here with us.
After all, you're Herman's only living relative.
Oh, Lily, how sweet.
Well, if you insist.
Eddie, come along, my boy.
You and me are going to dig up a little snack first.
Huh.
It's easy to see who got all the personality in that family.
Guess what, Herman.
Charlie is staying with us.
He's doing no such thing.
I want him and his phony uranium machine out of this house this instant!
Herman Munster!
How can you talk like that about your own flesh and blood?
Because I've known him longer than you.
Charlie Munster is a scoundrel and a con artist from way back.
The doctor who put him together didn't have an honest bone in his whole laboratory.
Oh, Herman, you're just jealous.
Why, having Charlie here in the house is like a breath of fresh earth.
I agree with Uncle Herman.
There's something not just right about Charlie.
Marilyn's right.
Just why is he showing up now?
I'll tell you why.
Lily, he's heard about that $5,000 your grandmother left you the last time she died.
And he's here to cheat you out of it with that uranium machine.
Why, shame on you, Herman.
And just because of that, I'm gonna check this machine and prove how wrong you are about Charlie.
Meanwhile, I insist he stay here.
All right.
All right.
But you will regret it.
I keep telling you Charlie's always been the white sheep in this family.
- When are you gonna believe me?
When?
- Nevermore.
Just a minute.
He's right here.
Uncle Charlie, telephone.
The man says it's important.
Oh.
Well, I wonder who that can be.
I distinctly instructed my secretary not to tell anybody where I was.
- Munster here.
- This is Leo Kraus.
Oh.
Oh, uh, hi, Knuckles.
Where's that thousand bucks I put up for that phony machine of yours?
I gave you 24 hours to pay me back.
Well Well, now, a-as as a matter of fact, I'm in the process of taking care of that little matter right now.
You've got exactly 24 hours to hand over the dough; otherwise, you'll get your head broken.
It's my head broker.
L I mean, my head broker.
Well, thank you very much for the advice, Mr. Kraus.
I don't think it's gonna be too difficult to arrange.
You mean to tell me you actually found a sucker to buy that machine?
- There can't be anybody that stupid.
- Oh, but there is.
Which brings me to a very important point.
- I hope you don't mind me selling one of our machines for $5,000.
- $5,000?
I realize it's a ridiculously small amount, but you see, it's for a member of my own family my favorite sister-in-law.
But why not?
Charlie says his partner gave him special permission to sell it to us.
He says I couldn't make a safer investment.
He says the ocean is full of uranium.
The ocean is also full of suckers, and I'm gonna see to it that you're not one of them.
After all, Grandma did leave that money to me.
And Grandpa's testing the machine.
He saw it work.
No.
It's a silly idea.
If your grandmother were alive, she'd be turning over in her grave.
As long as Charlie stays in this house, I'm gonna see to it that that money stays in the wall safe.
Let me see.
What was that combination again?
Oh, yes.
Two turns to the left.
Right to 14.
Back to six.
Now all we do is add a little water from the ocean and wait for the results that will prove to Uncle Herman how wrong he was about Uncle Charlie.
?
?
Eddie, quick, quick, get my Geiger counter.
Okay, Grandpa.
?
?
Huh.
Maybe I used the wrong ocean.
- Grandpa, this is nothing but sand.
- Sand?
Plain sand?
To the scientific mind, this means just one thing.
- Yes, it means that Uncle Charlie - Broken.
I broke Uncle Charlie's machine.
Left three.
Right 16.
Two turns to the left.
Stop at 24.
Aw, it's only gold again.
Oh, I've gotta fix this machine before good old Charlie finds out.
To the right.
Seven left.
Sixteen right.
Two turns to the left.
And presto!
There.
I'd like to see Charlie get his hands on it now.
Oh, Charlie, I'm afraid the answer is still no.
You know how Herman is.
I talked to him until I was pink in the face.
That sort of puts me in a funny position, Lily.
After all, my associates were only doing it as a favor to me.
Well, in case anybody wants me, I'll be down in my laboratory.
I've got a little work to do down there.
I wish he wouldn't do that.
It gets ashes all over the floor.
Can I heat this up for you?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We're all out of sugar.
I'll run over to Mrs. Cartwright's and borrow some.
Mrs. Cartwright?
She's the woman next door.
She's very fond of Herman.
He helps her a lot around the house.
Ah.
She's a bit eccentric though.
Been that way ever since her husband died.
- A widow?
- Yes.
Poor dear.
But fortunately, her husband left her well provided for.
Well, that is fortunate.
Lily, I'll get the sugar.
Allow me.
Sit right down.
Oh.
Thank you.
I'll just pop right over.
And I may pick up enough sugar for both of us.
Come in.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Oh, it's it's you, Mr. Munster.
Oh, hello.
Uh Mrs. Cartwright?
Oh, of course.
Come in, Mr. Munster.
Oh, my, don't you look grand.
What have you done to yourself?
Oh, you mean the suit?
Like it?
Oh, it's very handsome, and I imagine very expensive.
Custom made.
You see, I made an investment recently on a little invention that turned out rather well.
Well, on to a good thing and you didn't even tell me about it.
That isn't very neighborly, Mr. Munster.
Call me Herman.
That's right, Knuckles.
I got the five grand.
You can call off your boys.
I unloaded that crazy machine.
Some old biddy named Cartwright.
I'm on my way now with the loot.
I gotta blow town quick before my brother finds out.
And, Charlie, don't do anything cute or your frame will float.
Charlie sold that machine to Mrs. Cartwright?
I was just talking to her through the barbed wire fence.
She's floating on air.
She'll make the fortune we missed.
Lily, that machine is just what I told you it was a phony.
- "A phony"?
- That's right.
I just sent Marilyn downtown to the National Chemical Institute, and they told her that while seawater is full of uranium, there's absolutely no way of extracting it.
Oh, Herman, you were right about Charlie.
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have to buy back that machine.
But that will take every last cent of Grandma's legacy.
The good name of Munster is more important than any amount of money.
Oh, serves me right for trusting Charlie.
If you don't learn to be more careful, the next time Grandma dies, she'll leave her money to someone else.
After I'm finished with this, I'm gonna kick Charlie out of here every lock, stock and monocle of him!
Two turns to the left.
Right 14.
Left Oh, the heck with it!
So you see, Mrs. Cartwright, the machine is actually worthless.
So I wouldn't want you to get stuck with it.
If it's worthless, why did you sell it to me?
That wasn't me.
That was my twin brother.
Your twin brother?
Oh!
Oh, no, no, Mr. Munster.
There couldn't possibly be two like you.
It's really true.
But that's not important now.
Mrs. Cartwright, I'll pay you back your whole $5,000.
I don't know.
I mean, if you'd go to all the trouble of changing your clothes and making up that story about a twin brother, you must want that machine pretty badly.
I'm just trying to do the right thing.
Well, in that case, you can have it Good.
For $5,500.
But, Mrs. Cartwright, you only paid 5,000.
I know.
I know.
But a poor, defenseless widow like me has got to make a teeny-weeny bit of profit.
That's the democratic way.
Charlie.
Charlie, you're not leaving without saying good-bye?
Charlie, I guess you're mad because they told you.
Told me what?
That I broke your machine.
But I didn't mean to.
I was just trying That's quite all right, Grandpa.
That's not my problem any longer.
You see, I sold that old machine to Lady Cartwright.
Ooh.
But she'll be glad to know that I fixed it.
It works just fine now.
But, you see, someone took it out of the lab, and I still have a few adjustments to make.
Forget the machine, Grandpa.
I'm leaving now.
Cheers.
"Fixed it"?
What do you mean, "fixed it"?
Well, look, just a few minutes ago, I made this with the machine.
Huh?
Look at this.
What do you think?
That's uranium?
It ain't bat feathers.
Ah, Mrs. Cartwright, I've decided not to sell you my uranium machine.
I have to have it back.
Yes, I know.
Oh, fine.
So, here's your money.
Let me have the machine.
Mr. Munster, you've already given me the money back and taken the machine.
When did I do that?
Just before you changed your clothes.
But I didn't change my clothes.
Wait a minute.
This fellow who gave you the money back, was he about this tall?
Yes.
Was he built like me?
Uh-huh.
Well, that explains it.
That was my twin brother.
Brother.
Now that we own this thing, what are we gonna do with it?
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do with it.
I'm gonna smash it into 5,500 pieces.
- Don't do that.
- Why not?
It's mine.
I paid for it.
And at least I'm gonna get the pleasure of smashing it.
Charlie Munster, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
How could you do this to us after the way we trusted you?
Charlie, you proved one thing.
Water is thicker than blood.
I suppose you're right.
I ought to be ashamed of myself.
Charlie, you're no good.
And I'll tell you another thing.
You What did you say?
I said, you're right.
I am no good.
For the first time in my life, I've been forced to look myself in the face, and it's a pretty frightening picture.
I get the feeling I've just been insulted.
Being here with all of you has, well, shown me the error of my ways.
If you'll just give me another chance, I'll do my best to make it up to you.
Well, if you ask me, it's a little late for that now.
- It's 2:00.
- Shut up!
Nevermore.
I realize I've done a lot of rotten things, but, you see, I've changed.
And to prove it, I'm gonna buy that worthless machine back from you.
Oh, yeah?
- W-When do I get paid?
- Nevermore.
- Oh, do shut up.
- He's wound up too tight.
I'll pay you this very moment.
Oh, well, l Here's the money.
Well, Charlie, l Well Charlie, I guess I misjudged you.
We all make mistakes.
We're only human.
Well, cheerio.
At least let me drive you to the station.
Oh, uh, not necessary, old boy.
I already phoned a cab.
Well, ta-ta, all.
Don't forget your old Uncle Charlie.
Eddie, here's a little something for your piggy bank.
Good-bye, Charlie.
You made the right decision.
After all, you can't always get by on your good looks.
I suppose you're right.
Good-bye.
Good Good-bye.
Good-bye, Charlie.
Charlie.
!
Good-bye, Charlie.
Charlie!
Was that Charlie?
He just left.
Oh, I wanted to talk to him.
You know, he's been acting kind of strange since I fixed his machine.
- "Fixed his machine"?
- Yeah.
I showed him this batch of uranium I made, and he hightailed it over to Mrs. Cartwright like a bat out of heaven.
He tricked me again with that sob story of his.
Darn it!
Look, Pop, the quarter's fake too.
He gypped us all.
That machine was a phony until you made it work.
I'm glad he took it with him.
I wouldn't want that machine around this house.
- Why not?
- Well, I'll tell you.
If he starts fooling with that machine, there's no telling what may happen.
- Driver, to the airport, and step on it.
- What's the hurry, Charlie?
Knuckles.
Where's the five "G"s?
I haven't got it.
But, Knuckles, I've got something much better.
Both you and I are going to be millionaires.
Just let me show you this machine.
You see, now it really works.
Okay.
But this time it better be good.
He's in the cab, Grandpa.
What was that about the machine?
Oh, nothing.
It's just that the machine  The machine's still got a few bugs in it.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Oh, what a beautiful day.
Herman, are you ready?
Herman!
I'm coming, dear.
I'm coming.
I couldn't get the lid closed.
Now, do you have the potato salad?
Yes, dear.
Do you have the pickles?
Yes, dear.
Are we going someplace?
Yes, Grandpa.
It's such a nice day.
Herman and I are going to the beach.
You're not taking me?
Grandpa, you know you never enjoy the beach.
All you ever do when you get there is bury yourself in the sand.
Coming, dear?
Bye, Grandpa.
All right.
All right.
I'll stay home and play checkers with Marilyn and Eddie.
Eddie!
Eddie?
I'm right here, Grandpa.
Eddie, how about you going to find Marilyn, and then the three of us will have a checker tournament?
Oh, Marilyn went out with her new boyfriend.
And I have to go play with one of the neighbor kids.
Which one?
I don't know.
I haven't caught him yet.
That's it.
Go ahead.
Go to the beach, go to your boyfriend's, go to your girlfriend's.
Leave the old man alone.
Who needs a lonely, sick old grandfather?
Hey!
Wait a minute!
Igor Igor, how about you and I having a game of checkers, huh?
Oh, you got a date too.
Oh, Igor, you got no heart.
You're nothing but a rat with wings.
Oh, boy.
When is anybody around here gonna pay any attention to a poor old man!
Nevermore, nevermore.
What's this?
"Are you lonely?
Do you seek affection, companionship and matrimony in the sunset years"?
Why, that's positively spooky.
"Let the Kindred Spirits Matrimonial Agency make your "September Song' a duet".
A wife.
Why not?
It sure beats burying yourself in the sand.
?
?
Good morning, Marilyn.
My, you're in a good humor this morning.
Eh, Marilyn, what would you say if I told you I was going to cast my line into the sea of matrimony and catch a new grandmother for you?
Grandpa, that's wonderful!
Aunt Lily!
Uncle Herman!
Guess what?
What?
Grandpa's got a girl!
Oh, Father!
Grandpa, you haven't been setting out those traps in the park again?
I told you before.
It's not neighborly.
No.
It's a girl, a fiancée.
How charming!
Who is she?
Ohh!
Now, don't rush me.
I only wrote to the matrimonial agency yesterday.
- Matrimonial agency?
- Now, what's wrong with that?
Well, I think it's disgraceful, beneath the family's dignity.
We're not the same as the average members of the community, you know.
Why, Herman, what a snobbish thing to say.
People look up to me, watch me on the street.
I have an important image to uphold.
Oh, Herman, don't be such a stuffed shirt.
Grandpa!
Matrimonial agency Grandmother would be turning over in her grave, if she had one.
She's not quite as pretty as Grandma.
Well what can you expect, huh?
A woman like your grandmother only comes along once in a lifetime, every 300 years.
Let me see the letter.
Her name's Lydia Gardner.
Oh.
She was quite impressed with my picture.
Hi, everybody.
Well, back from a hard day at the salt mines.
Well, did I get any mail?
Sorry, Uncle Herman.
Nothing.
Oh.
But guess what Grandpa got a reply from that matrimonial agency.
Well, I hope he isn't gonna answer it.
Ohhh!
I suppose she isn't good enough for you.
That's not it.
It has nothing to do with it.
It's the way you're going about it romance by mail.
You're too old to be playing post office.
Well, I have as much rights as anybody in this house, and I'm inviting Mrs. Gardner here to come and see us all.
You really think she'll fall for you?
Well, you can stand there and ask that?
You bring a sensitive, impressionable woman here and expose her to me, and you don't know what will happen?
Well, if you bring her here, do it while I'm at work.
I want no part of this.
Hmm.
Now, Herman, why are you so against this romance?
Sometimes I think you have no heart at all.
Don't be silly, dear.
That's what they put in first.
Oh, how do you do.
L-I'm Lydia Gardner.
The matrimonial agency sent me?
Oh, yes!
We've been expecting you.
Oh.
Won't you come in?
Oh, thank you.
We thought we'd have tea in the living room.
Grandpa's just dying to meet you.
Oh?
My dear, this is such a lovely old home.
It's so, uh, different.
Thank you.
It does attract attention.
We've had a lot of comment on it from the neighbors.
It's a gracious tribute to the age of this lovely old home that you've left it just as it was.
Oh, but we didn't leave it.
It took Aunt Lily and Uncle Herman years to get it this way.
Oh?
Of course, they could only work on it nights.
Ooh.
!
What's that?
Why, that's my Aunt Lily.
Striking, isn't she?
Oh, you must be Mrs. Gardner.
I'm Lily Munster.
Oh, my dear, you're exactly the way I pictured you.
Such poise, such ethereal beauty - You're like something out of this world.
- Oh.
Thank you.
Will you have cream or lemon?
Uh, cream, please.
That's just Dad.
He's such a show-off.
- "Dad"?
- Grandpa.
- Prepare to be impressed.
-  Voilá!
Lydia, my darling, at last.
Did I frighten you?
Oh, well, uh Eh, yes, you did.
Good!
I see you've been getting acquainted with the girls.
But that isn't who you came to meet, is it?
Well, what do you think?
Well, I think you're magnificent.
And-And I must tell you I never did believe in long engagements.
We were hoping you'd come and stay with us for a while, so that you and Grandfather could get acquainted.
Oh, that's a splendid idea.
But, of course, I'd have to get my things.
Of course, my darling.
But first, let me show you around the house.
Aunt Lily, I can't quite put my finger on it, but, somehow, that woman seems strange.
Doesn't everybody?
You'll learn to live with it, dear.
I have.
Kindred Spirits Matrimonial Agency.
Malcolm talking.
Oh, Mathers.
Steve, yes.
Hello.
Yes, we got your letter.
Matter of fact, I have it right here in my hand.
And your Dun & Bradstreet rating.
And we have found just the girl for you Mrs. Lydia Gardner, a dear person.
What?
Oh, I know how you feel, but it, uh it will be another week before she can come out to the coast.
She, uh, has to attend a funeral very close relative by marriage.
I tell you what, Steve.
There are a couple of things you can be doing.
You received our insurance forms and the last will and testament blank?
Good.
Well, I'll tell you what.
Steve.
Now, if you'll just sign them and have them notarized and What's that?
Oh, beneficiary.
Oh, it's printed right on the forms.
Fine, Mr. Mathers.
Thank you.
Good-bye.
- Hello, darling.
- Hello, baby.
Hello.
Well, did you meet your latest husband-to-be?
Mm-hmm.
Perfectly dreadful house, but he'll be a pushover.
Looks like he has one foot in the grave already.
Good.
This one will make five men married and "morgued" in the past three months.
Malcolm, I'm thinking of a way to save at least a day and a half on each operation.
Uh-huh.
Get them to combine the funeral with the reading of the will.
Lydia, that's brilliant.
How do you think of things like this?
Very simple.
All you need is an attorney who plays the organ.
Here's his picture back.
Better put it in the file with his letter.
Hmm.
You know, honey, this one keeps reminding me of Poochy Dowling.
Wouldn't you say this fellow looks a lot like Poochy, hmm?
You mean the way the way he looked when I pushed him  I mean, when he fell off his yacht on our honeymoon cruise?
Uh, no.
No, more the way he looked a week later, when they fished him out of the water.
?
?
Lily, stop fussing, will you?
What are you so grumpy about?
I just want the house to look nice.
Eh.
It's all this paperwork Lydia brought with her insurance, last will and testament.
I tell you getting married is not what it used to be.
I thought all you had to do was take a blood test, and I was kinda looking forward to that.
Well, that's that.
But Lydia's a darling.
She's worth all the red tape.
We'll be as sweet and cozy as two little bats in a cave.
I'm sure you will.
Hello, dear.
Grandpa.
Well, back from the salt mines again.
Mmm!
Fresh weeds, do we have company?
Hardly.
More like a close relative, uh, wouldn't you say, Lily?
Yes.
Grandpa's intended is in the kitchen.
I want you to meet her, Herman.
His mail-order bride is in this house?
- I'm disgusted.
- ?
?
And I want no part of it.
If I was ever to lower myself to meet that woman, - I could never face myself again.
- Herman, she's going to be How could you do this to me, Lily?
And how could you do this to the memory of Grandmother?
I am never gonna meet that woman, and I'm putting my foot down right now!
Oh!
Oh, darn!
Excuse me.
Lily, give Herman time.
Lydia'll be around with us for a while.
He's bound to run into her sooner or later.
Oh.
Oh, how nice!
Just wanted to be helpful.
Oh, eh, by the way, eh, uh, I signed all the papers you gave me.
Here.
Nothing like a little bite before dinner.
No, no, no, dear!
Uh, I made this just for Grandpa.
Thank you, dear.
Go away, kitty.
Shoo!
Shoo!
Shoo!
Don't mind Kitty.
She's just like one of the family.
Oh, I just can't get over how utterly charming this place is.
These antiques must be worth a fortune, if one should decide to sell them.
We do have a lot of valuable pieces, but everything here isn't an antique.
Um, oh, well, that chair for instance that's just something Grandpa picked up at a prison surplus store.
It isn't even plugged in.
How quaint.
Incidentally, Mrs. Munster, uh, where is your husband?
Oh, Herman was so sorry he couldn't be here to greet you, but he had one of his wretched headaches, and he had to retire early.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Uh, do any other members of your family live with you?
No, they're all dead.
I see.
Passed away?
No, they haven't gone anywhere.
They're just dead.
Well now, Lydia, darling.
Come with me, and I'll show you to your room.
Grandpa, let's put Lydia in the guest room.
Oh Oh, it's on the sunny side of the house.
I hope you won't mind too much.
Uh, no.
Oh, that will be fine.
Good.
Good.
Come right this way.
You know, you remind me of someone very dear, someone I lost.
Do you mind if I call you Poochy?
Aunt Lily, I still don't know about that woman.
There's something that just hits a false note.
Marilyn, you've got to stop being so critical of people.
Oh, Aunt Lily, you're so ingenuous.
Herman?
What?
Listen.
I don't hear anything.
That's it!
The shutters have stopped squeaking.
Lily, you're always not hearing things.
Go to sleep.
Malcolm, I made the old boy an avocado mickey, but he didn't take it.
So, I'm going to arrange the accident right away.
I told him I'm a very heavy sleeper, and I don't want to miss an important phone call from my dear sister in California.
So, Malcolm, you dial this number in just ten minutes.
He'll come hurrying downstairs to answer the phone.
It'll be slip, slide, crash, bang, and by this time tomorrow, the estate will be in probate.
Never could sleep on an empty stomach.
But I couldn't eat dinner with that woman.
And I hope Grandpa doesn't marry her.
Marilyn I keep telling her to put the phone back.
Teenagers.
Hmph!
Drafty old house.
Now, you stay out there and be a nice kitty.
And drink all your milk!
Herman, can't you be quiet?
You'll wake the dead!
You know, Lily, this house is very strange tonight.
It's also very noisy, thanks to you.
Well, if a man can't have a sandwich in his own house  If a man would eat his dinner when he was supposed to.
I don't like to eat with strangers.
Ohh.
One sweet, little stranger, who is about to become a member of the family whether you like it or not.
That's right.
Ignore my opinion.
Make me feel unwanted, like an intruder.
If you're an intruder, then you'd better find someplace else to sleep, because this room is reserved for my husband!
Well!
If that's the way you feel about it, I'll just go downstairs and sleep on the sofa.
Why should I have to spend the night on a short, lumpy sofa?
I'll use the guest room.
-  -    Herman, what have you done?
Not a thing!
Oh, I'll get it.
Lydia's gone!
What did you say to her?
I didn't say a word.
She just looked at me, screamed and ran out.
Let me go!
Oh, good evening, miss.
We wanted to let you know we got her, - and she confessed to everything.
- Got her?
- Mrs. Gardner!
- "Mrs. Gardner"?
Ha!
"Black Widow" Gardner.
Your Grandpa wasn't the first man she tried to marry just to get his dough.
We picked up her accomplice, and he said she was here.
Just as we drove up, she came busting out of the house.
- You mean she's some kind of a swindler?
- The queen of them all.
You know, your grandfather's the only one she hasn't managed to do away with.
I thought all that sweetness was too good to be true.
You know, I hate to tell you this, miss, but she thinks you've got a monster in that house.
A monster?
Oh, that's ridiculous.
- There's nobody in here but my family.
- That's what we figured.
She's just trying to build up an insanity plea to make it easy for herself.
Well, good night, miss.
Come on, Mrs. Gardner.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
I couldn't face him again.
Good night!
And thank you!
Did that policeman say that-that Lydia was trying to kill me?
I'm sorry, Grandpa, but she was the notorious "Black Widow".
See?
I told you.
You can't be too careful.
When you think of some of the people running around loose in the world today Ha it's frightening.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Herman, honey, did you enjoy the movie tonight?
Oh, it was fine, dear.
Just fine.
But you know, Lily, I don't think everybody at the drive-in cared for the picture.
When I got out of the car to get some refreshments, I noticed people leaving in droves.
I noticed that too.
Why, some of them even drove right out through the fence to get out.
And did you see those head-on collisions?
Well, that's showbiz.
Lily, I'm awfully tired tonight.
I think I'll go up to bed.
Oh.
So early, dear?
It's only 2:00 in the morning.
Well, I haven't been sleeping too well lately.
For the past few days, I've been tossing and turning all afternoon.
Herman!
Oh, I left my fur coat out in the backseat of the car.
Before you go to bed, would you be a dear and bring it in?
But, Lily, I'm Oh, come on, Herman.
I don't want to lose it.
It's my new wolf-dyed mink.
All right, dear.
But I'm I'm dead on my feet.
Hey, it sure got windy all of a sudden.
Yeah.
Freddie.
What?
I think we found one.
Hey, you're right, Al.
This is the perfect getaway car for that bank job tonight.
And the keys are in it.
Let's go.
Grandpa!
Grandpa, are you down there?
What is it, Lily?
I'm in the middle of a very big experiment.
Grandpa, listen.
Twenty minutes ago, Herman went to the car to get my coat.
I just looked out front and both he and the car are gone.
Don't worry, Lily.
Why, when I was younger in the Old Country, I was always disappearing in the middle of the night.
Of course, that was before I got rheumatism in my wings.
Grandpa, I hope Herman didn't get any ideas from the movie we saw tonight.
In the picture, David Niven leaves his wife to chase after Tuesday Weld.
Oh, Lily, it's nothing like that.
Why, Herman loves you from the bottom of his hearts.
Of course.
Of course, you're right.
You're right, Grandpa.
I know Herman loves me.
But where is he?
What could possibly make a man leave his happy home?
Tuesday Weld.
Tuesday Weld.
If there's anything I can't stand, it's a bigmouthed raven.
Hey, Al, where we gonna pick up Marty?
You know, the farmhouse.
Then we all take off together from there.
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Freddie, wake up, will ya?
I am awake.
So how come you just snored?
I didn't snore.
How do you know?
'Cause I'm awake.
I know I'm awake 'cause I can hear myself talking.
When I'm sleeping, I don't hear myself talk on account I never say nothing unless I'm awake.
So if I'm awake, how could I have snored?
Freddie, do me a favor, will ya?
Yeah?
Go back to sleep.
You mean he just disappeared, Aunt Lily?
Oh, yes, Marilyn.
And it's not like Herman.
He's such a homebody.
What's all the excitement?
Did Grandpa blow himself up again?
Of course not.
We can't have fun and games all the time.
Eddie, this doesn't concern you.
Marilyn, will you take him back upstairs and put him to bed?
Come on, Eddie.
But gee, I wanna hear what's going on.
Is it okay if I leave the lid open?
We'll see, Eddie.
Is it okay if I leave the top half of the lid open?
Lily, who are you phoning?
Well, I'm not gonna just sit by and and do nothing.
- I'm gonna call the police.
- The police?
But, Lily, this is not necessary.
Hello?
I'd like the Missing Persons Bureau, please.
Yes.
This is Mrs. Herman Munster.
I'd like to report a missing person.
Yes, it's my husband.
He disappeared this evening.
Yes, ma'am, Mrs. Munster.
Could I have his description, please?
Well, he's about seven feet tall and weighs 380 pounds.
Seven feet, three hundred and eight Well, you see, he's been on a diet lately.
- Age?
- Uh Oh, just one moment, please.
Grandpa, how old is Herman?
I keep forgetting.
Well, they started working on him right after the War of 1812.
They ran into a shortage of parts at the medical school.
I'd say they sewed up the job around 1850.
Just put down middle-aged.
Any distinguishing characteristics?
No, nothing unusual.
You'd never even notice him if you met him on the street.
- Eyes?
- Two.
There wasn't room for any more.
I mean, what color?
Oh, oh, well, one's brown and one's chartreuse.
They thought it would match his complexion.
- Visible scars?
- No.
He has a He has a lovely beauty mark on his forehead though.
It's about five inches long, and it's shaped like a bolt of lightning.
Lily, tell him our address.
Our address!
Oh, yes, yes.
We live at And-And please, please call me when you learn anything.
I'm awfully worried.
You see, he left the house in a in a sort of a daze.
Yes, ma'am.
We'll get right on it.
Benson?
Yes, Sergeant.
Get out a 106 on a Herman Munster.
The Mockingbird Heights vicinity.
What's up?
Well, his wife just called in.
But she was so hysterical, the description's kind of wild.
Just make it, uh Make it a tall, heavyset male with a sallow complexion.
May be suffering from amnesia.
Grandpa, they're going to send out a bulletin, but don't you think we ought to call the morgue?
No, Lily.
I think Herman was too sleepy to go and visit anybody.
Hey, Al, look.
The Big Dipper.
Where?
Oh, come on.
Let's get in there.
Hey, listen.
I hope we're not late.
Marty always works me over when we're late.
Wise up, will ya?
That means he likes ya.
Come on.
Hey, listen, Al.
Yeah?
Are you sure the car's gonna be all right out there?
Sure.
Nobody's gonna steal a car.
How many times do I have to tell you?
People are basically honest.
Hey, uh, we heisted a car.
Got here as soon as we could, Marty.
Yeah, Marty, yeah.
Now we're waiting for some big guy the boss is sending over.
His name is Big Louie.
He's gonna drive the car on the bank job and flatten anybody who gets in our way.
Hey, this is just like them George Raft pictures on television.
Ah, shut up, will ya?
So, why don't you deal, huh?
All right.
Hey, Marty, who's this Big Louie anyway?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.
But he's a great big goon.
Supposed to be a regular monster.
Oh, yeah, the boss says he's an ex-fighter.
He's punchy from 20 years in the ring.
Twenty years in the ring?
That's probably him now.
Uh, excuse me, but I seem to be lost.
You're not lost.
This is the place.
Get in here.
Uh, oh, no.
Maybe you don't understand.
You see my wife's coat Get in Uh, will you please get in here?
Well,  Uh, now that you put it that way.
You're late.
Late?
Yeah, come on, you.
Let's get going.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, but I couldn't go anywhere with you gentlemen.
Listen, you.
Nobody chickens out in this outfit, see?
Please, please, I'm very ticklish.
Will you stop the clownin' before I blow holes in you?
Now come on.
Gracious.
Hmm.
A lot of rude people in this world.
Let's go, Louie.
Step on it.
Boy, that Big Louie's the toughest-looking hatchet man I ever seen.
Yeah, boy, is he punchy.
How'd he get a face like that?
From only 20 years in the ring?
Come on, Louie.
There's work to be done.
Gracious.
I'd really rather not, gentlemen, but if you insist.
Hey, did anything escape from the zoo tonight?
No, but he kinda fits that 106 we got.
"Herman Munster tall, heavyset, male, sallow complexion".
Well, let's check him out.
Looking for something, mister?
Well, yeah.
I'm looking for an address.
What street do you want?
Well, uh, what street you got?
What do you think?
Fits the description.
Says "a possible amnesia victim".
Yeah, that's Herman Munster.
Looks like this amnesia victim forgot when to put the bottle down.
Why don't you get in with us, mister.
I think we know just the address you want.
Oh, don't mind if I do.
You know something?
I never got this kind of service in Kansas City.
Thank you.
Lily, we've been driving around for hours, and there's just no sign of Herman.
Maybe we should have waited at home for him.
Oh, no, no.
The police never called back.
We simply must keep on looking.
Poor Herman, he's so helpless.
There's a phone, Aunt Lily.
Maybe you could call the police and see if they've learned anything.
That's a good idea, Marilyn.
Gee, I wonder where Pop is.
Oh, Eddie, we should have left you home in bed.
What for?
You know I can't go to sleep till it's light out.
Really?
Oh, well well, thank you.
Th-Thank you.
Marilyn.
Grandpa.
Guess what.
The police picked up Herman a half hour ago.
The poor dear was walking the streets in a daze.
Where is he now?
Well, he was so groggy from lack of sleep that they took him to our house and put him to bed.
They thought he'd been drinking.
Can you imagine?
Why, that's ridiculous.
And that policeman made another odd remark.
He said something about our house looking spooky.
Hmm.
Well, there's just no accounting for taste.
As long as Herman is back in bed, why don't we head on home?
You know, Herman must have really been in a daze.
They said he kept insisting that his name was Louie.
Keep driving straight, then turn onto State Street.
Gentlemen, if-if you'll only allow me to phone my wife.
She must be very worried about me.
Louie, will you knock it off and do what you're told?
Yeah, knock it off.
Pull over there on the right.
Uh, but, Mr. Marty, that's a bank.
I don't believe it's open this early.
Very funny.
Pull over there, Louie.
-  - Let's scramble!
Come on, Louie.
Move it.
Move it fast!
Come on, stupid, move it!
Let's go!
What are you doing?
Step on it.
Uh, but, gentlemen, this is a 25-mile-an-hour zone.
Move it, stupid.
Y-Yes, sir.
Won't this car go any faster, Grandpa?
We've gotta get home and see how Herman is.
Faster?
We're doing 50 now.
Wait'll I get it out of low gear.
Grandpa, that looked like Herman in that car.
Nah, it couldn't be.
Herman is back home in bed.
It must be someone who looks just like him.
Yes, I guess there are lots of big, strong, handsome men in the world.
Marilyn, you get Eddie back into bed.
I'm going upstairs and see how Herman is.
Come on, Eddie.
Back in bed.
Oh, poor Herman, so tired.
There you are, pussycat.
Come on, pour it on.
We gotta lose those guys.
Yes, as soon as I make this boulevard stop.
Heavens to betsy!
I forgot to make a stop signal.
Get movin'!
Get movin'!
That way!
Come on!
Just our luck, it's starting to rain.
Quick, back it up in there.
We got it made.
They're gonna go right past us.
Hey, what are you doing?
We can't stay here.
It says "No Parking.
Unloading Only".
What's that crazy kook doing?
You see that, Grady.
That driver wrecked that car on purpose.
All right, you guys, up against the wall, all of you.
Get 'em up!
Nice and easy.
Check the driver of the car.
I think he hit his head.
You're gonna tear my coat.
Come on!
Hustle 'em out!
Get your hands up!
Wait.
Now, wait!
All right, already.
Hey, here's the loot from the bank job.
What's the matter?
It's horrible.
Don't look, Blake.
His face it's disfigured for life.
Oh!
Poor devil.
You ever see anything so bad?
Not since the explosion in the morgue.
All right, easy now.
Easy.
Nice and easy there.
Why don't you come over and lay down over here.
We'll, uh, we'll have an ambulance here for you in a minute.
Oh, uh, thank you, but I don't need an ambulance.
I just wanna go home.
I never heard of anyone so brave.
Brave?
Uh, uh, those three men made me drive the car while they pulled a bank job.
I figured the only way out was to wreck the car.
Fine.
You're a very public-spirited citizen, but please try not to talk now till we get you to a hospital.
But, uh, but I don't want to go to a hospital.
In your condition, that's the only place to go.
No, no, no, no, no!
L-I won't go to a hospital!
Uh, my name is Herman Munster, I live on Mockingbird Lane, and I wanna go home now!
An accident?
Well, it You must be mistaken, Officer Grady.
It can't possibly be my husband you're bringing home.
She said you can't be her husband.
Let-Let me talk to her.
Hello, Lily?
It's me.
Herman?
It just can't be you there when it's you here.
I mean, there must be some explanation.
Uh, Lily, I'll explain everything when I get home, dear.
Hmm.
Herman?
Who was that on the phone, Lily?
Well, he said it was Herman, and it sounded like Herman, but Herman's upstairs.
Grandpa!
You and I are going to take a look in the bedroom.
Herman?
Herman?
- Uh, what?
-  It isn't Herman!
I know I must have died, and they sent me to the bad place.
Grandpa, there's someone sleeping in my bed.
Who is it?
It ain't Goldilocks.
This must be Brimstone City, a-and you're the devil!
Hippity-bippity, rinkety-dink, make like a statue and freeze, you fink!
That'll hold him.
Come on, Grandpa.
I'm gonna get the police on the phone again.
Help.
!
Help.
!
Let me down.
!
Don't go away.
Help.
!
Let me down.
!
Oh, Grandpa, do you suppose Herman really was in an accident?
Now, Lily, don't get upset until you've seen him.
After all, you know that the police have been mistaken about Herman before.
I suppose you're right, Grandpa.
Last time Herman fell asleep in the park, we had to pick him up at the mortuary.
Oh, Herman, it's so wonderful to have you back.
Thank you, dear.
Oh, uh, Herman.
Um, I was so worried, I reported you to the Missing Persons Bureau.
They brought around some big lunk who calls himself Big Louie.
Grandpa has him frozen in the bedroom.
Big Louie?
Shh!
I told the police to wait, and I'd bring him right down.
Do you know something?
Those crooks tonight kept calling me Louie.
I'll bet that's the man they were waiting for when I showed up.
I'll go and get him.
Okay, Louie, unfreeze.
Come on, already.
Defrost.
!
What are those magic words?
Alakazam!
Abracadabra.
!
Oh, fiddlesticks!
Uh, what round is it?
Never mind that, Louie.
Just come with me.
You're a good boy.
We'll get you all nice and neat.
I like you.
We have a lot of people downstairs for you to meet.
I've never had such a drive in my life.
At one point, I was driving down the street Come right downstairs to the police.
We'll probably get a reward.
Let's go, Louie.
Come on.
Where's my manager?
I was fouled.
I wanna get outta here.
What a frightening person.
You're right.
Can you imagine anyone mistaking him for my big, sweet, handsome husband?
Oh, Lily.
Oh, Herman.
You're blushing.
Really?
Yes.
You're turning the most adorable shade of green.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Gr-Grandpa, I won't stand for it!
It's a terrible thing to do.
It's downright murder!
Herman, I know it could be a disaster, but I think we ought to let Grandpa go through with his experiment.
Herman, I just wanna fill your gas tank with water.
But it's crazy trying to turn water into gasoline with a pill.
Uh, uh You'll ruin my beautiful car.
Herman, why don't we humor him?
Last time we did, he invented athlete's foot.
Oh.
I forgot about that.
Uh, uh Go ahead, Grandpa.
And now for my "instant gasoline" pill.
- What's it doing?
- Never mind that, Herman.
Just get in and start 'er up.
Grandpa, it'll never work.
Oh, Herman, don't be such a doubting Thomas.
Grandpa, you're a genius.
Naturally.
-  -   Grandpa, I drove all the way around the block.
What kept you?
Grandpa?
You're not writing crank letters to "Dear Abby" again?
No, of course not.
I'm sending a sample of my "instant gasoline" pill to the Reliable Oil Company.
Ho ho!
Boy, when they buy my invention, we'll all be millionaires.
Well, we could certainly use some money.
I'd like to carpet the dungeon in wall-to-wall moss and get some new lightning rods for the house.
I think you're being very selfish.
You should stop thinking of yourself and share your invention with mankind.
I am gonna share it, 50-50.
They get the pill.
I get the money.
- Now, really.
-  Oh, Marilyn.
Oh, my.
Those circles under your eyes how lovely you look today.
Well, I wish I felt as well as I look.
I just haven't been able to sleep for the last two nights.
Have you tried hanging from the rafters with your head down like I do?
I'd like to, Grandpa, but I just don't seem to have the toes for it.
Well, I'll go down to the lab later, and I'll mix you up something.
Um, uh, all right, but be careful.
I don't trust those homemade remedies of yours.
The last time, you invented a medicine for which there was no disease.
I'm not kidding, Mr. Hadley.
According to the old gentleman's letter, he's found a way to turn water into gasoline.
I know you're not kidding, Dick, but that's one of the oldest wheezes in the oil business.
Sir, look.
I'll drop this pill into this pan of water.
Now, smell it.
Sure, it smells like gasoline.
A lot of them do.
But that's as far as it goes.
Now, don't waste your time with him.
He's just an old crackpot.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
W-W-Well, don't just stand there.
Like I said, go get that old genius signed up.
Let me see.
Two parts monassium contabinate.
Two parts?
Now, Herman, please.
I'm working on my "instant gasoline" formula.
Boy.
If Louis Pasteur had had you looking over his shoulder, I'm sure he never would have invented rabies.
Uh, uh You could use some advice from me.
I hung around labs long before I was born.
Hi, Grandpa.
You haven't come across a cure for insomnia, have you?
No.
I'm sorry.
I've been busy working on my gas pill.
Are you still having trouble getting to sleep, dear?
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I'll tell you what, Marilyn.
Now you just sit right down here, and I'll put you to sleep with my hypnotism.
I'm very good at that, you know.
Now you just concentrate on my watch, all right?
Now look at the watch and concentrate.
Abracadabra, hop toad pie, look your grandpa in the eye.
When your grandpa counts to three, fast asleep you're going to be.
One, two, three!
Oh, well.
There's a wise guy in every crowd.
Don't worry, Marilyn.
I'll mix you a sleeping potion.
Now, let me see.
Where are the recipes?
Grandpa, it's a telegram from the oil company.
They're sending a man tomorrow to discuss your invention with you.
Tomorrow.
That's fine.
I'll have a batch of my "instant gasoline" pills ready by then.
But what about my insomnia?
Don't worry, Marilyn.
I'll make you a sleeping potion at the same time.
Grandpa, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Now, Lily, please.
Don't tell a mad scientist how to run his business.
Herman?
Herman, you get up.
I wish you wouldn't take naps down here.
You know I like to keep a neat dungeon.
Uh, yes, dear.
Grandpa and his experiments!
Why couldn't I have had a normal father-in-law who goes to church at night and plays bingo?
Oh, calm down, Herman.
So he blows up the house once in a while.
He just wants to feel needed.
Besides, he has to get those gasoline pills made, and he has to find a sleeping potion for Marilyn.
Oh, Marilyn, dear.
Why are you up so late?
I just can't get to sleep.
I'm going to see if Grandpa's made me the sleeping potion yet.
I'm just dead on my feet.
Isn't everybody?
Ah!
This is the thing I've been looking for.
Grandpa.
Marilyn!
Don't ever do that.
You'll scare me right out of my skin, and you know how hard it is to get back into it.
I'm sorry, Grandpa, but I've got to have that sleeping potion.
Oh, don't worry.
I've got it all ready.
?
?
Let me see Aha!
Here it is.
No, no.
That's not it either.
No, no.
Ah!
Here it is.
I'll put a head on it for you.
?
?
Heh.
Bottoms up.
Courage.
Thank you, Grandpa, but I don't feel a thing.
I'm still as wide awake as ?
?
Nighty-night.
Good morning, Lily.
Good morning, dear.
Oh, my.
You look positively green around the gills.
Oh, thank you.
Good morning, Mom.
Good morning, Pop.
Good morning, Eddie.
Good morning, family.
Good morning.
Good morning, Grandpa.
Uh, say, has Marilyn come up yet?
No, no.
She's asleep in the lab still.
Eddie, you'd better go down and wake her up.
She'll be late for class.
Okay.
Oh, he's such a good boy.
Yes, but I wish he'd learn to be neater.
I keep telling him over and over again not to leave these empty pet food cans around after he's fed Spot.
He leaves them all over the place.
Grandpa, how's the gasoline pill going?
The man from the oil company's coming today.
I got a little sidetracked making a sleeping potion for Marilyn, but I'll have those pills ready in time.
You know, Grandpa, your invention may revolutionize motoring.
Instead of gasoline, we may all need credit cards to buy water.
Mom!
Dad!
Marilyn won't wake up.
What?
I shook her, but she just lies there.
Oh, dear!
Hurry.
Well, Grandpa, just don't stand there.
Do something.
That's it, all right.
What do you mean?
Well, I got a little confused.
I must have given her the Sleeping Beauty potion by mistake.
Oh!
That means she'll sleep forever.
No, no.
The spell can be broken.
To wake this sleeping beauty, you must remember this.
To break the spell of slumber, a prince her lips must kiss.
Oh, my.
That's the front door.
Grandpa, you'd better do something fast.
But, Grandpa, wh-wh-where are we ever gonna get a handsome prince to kiss Marilyn?
Oh, where are we gonna get a handsome prince, period?
Mrs. Munster?
Yes?
I'm, uh I'm the Reliable Oil Company.
L-I mean I'm from the Reliable Oil Company, and-and I have some business I'd like to discuss with your father.
Oh, I'm sorry, but he's terribly busy right now.
Could you come back later?
You see, it's a family problem, a domestic crisis.
Oh, couldn't I just speak to him for a minute?
I'm terribly sorry, but it's out of the question right now.
You come back later, all right?
I have to get back to the dungeon.
Yes, of course.
"The dungeon"?
If you'd just keep your files straight, Grandpa, this never would have happened.
You're right, Herman.
I've done a terrible thing to Marilyn.
You shouldn't have kept that stupid Sleeping Beauty formula around in the first place.
It's too dangerous.
I'll get rid of it right now.
Good.
Where is it?
Oh.
Ha ha.
There it is.
Oh.
I'll take care of this right now.
Good riddance.
Then what's this?
Oh, this?
Oh, no!
This is the Sleeping Beauty formula.
Then, uh, then what I burned the formula for instant gasoline.
Grandpa, you are the world's oldest goofball.
Domestic crisis?
Why, Dick, boy, they're just stalling.
What kind of domestic crisis?
I don't know exactly, sir.
It's kind of strange over there that-that house and everything.
Well, all these geniuses are a little odd.
Why would they want to stall me off?
They probably want to get some offers from some of the other oil companies.
And play one bid off against the other.
Exactly.
And that means we've got to act fast.
Dick, I want you to get back there, get that slippery old fox signed up.
I don't care what you go through.
Just sign him up.
Yes, sir.
Dick.
If you come back with that contract, it means a vice presidency.
A vice presidency?
Yes, sir.
And remember, Dick, the honor and integrity of the Reliable Oil Company is at stake.
So get that contract by hook or crook!
Yes, sir.
Nah!
Duds, every one of'em.
Not a prince in the whole bunch.
Hmm!
They just don't make frogs the way they used to in Transylvania.
Grandpa!
You and your old-world methods.
Hah!
Lily and I are going about it the modern, sensible way.
Oh.
And, uh, what is the "modern, sensible way" to find the prince?
Look in the Yellow Pages?
No.
We put an ad in the newspaper.
Oh.
Uh, listen to this.
"Wanted: Genuine prince.
"Must be young and handsome.
White steed optional.
"Temporary employment.
Fringe benefits".
Bah!
You won't even get frogs with that.
I'm afraid you're wrong, Grandpa.
Eddie says there are already two applicants upstairs who answered the ad.
I'm going to interview them.
Oh, and, Herman, when we're ready for the kissing, I'll call you to bring Marilyn up.
Hah!
What are they putting on here?
Uh, I don't know.
My agent sent me over.
Said they advertised for a prince.
Goodness, Newmar, these off-Broadway theaters get creepier and further out all the time.
- Gentlemen.
- Well, whatever they're doing, they're already in rehearsal.
It's so nice of you to come.
Uh, I understand you're lookin' for a prince.
Yes.
Uh, just exactly what is it we're to do?
Are you familiar with the story of Sleeping Beauty?
Sleeping Beau Oh, yes.
A delightful fable.
Oh, I was in the Beckett adaptation at Royal Beach.
It's nice to be versatile.
But the prince I'm looking for will have to give an authentic kiss.
Uh, what's the motivation?
What's the salary?
You gonna have tryouts?
Tryouts?
Yeah.
You know, test the both of us and decide which of us is best.
Oh, that's a splendid idea.
Herman?
We're ready.
Man, this is certainly a fascinating theater you got here.
This isn't a theater.
This is our home.
Your home?
Newmar.
Look!
They're the rudest pair I've ever seen.
Lily, I'll bet you forgot to warn them about Marilyn's looks.
Oh, I did forget.
Oh, dear.
I love her so much I keep forgetting about her handicap.
Poor dear.
Hmm.
Well, thank goodness she has us to stand between her and the world.
Back, Spot, back.
Bad boy.
Oh, it's you.
He must have thought you were the new milkman.
Doesn't he like milkmen?
Oh, he loved the last one.
He kept burying him in the backyard.
Very playful.
Oh, yes.
Mrs. Munster, I have some pressing business which I simply must discuss "father" with your "further".
I mean, further with your-your father.
Perhaps you remember me.
Yes, and I'm awfully sorry, but Father is still too busy to see you.
But, Mrs. Munster, l-I am with the Reliable Oil Company, and I can match or better any deal you may have been offered by the competition.
I am sure you're what you say, but I'm sorry.
He just hasn't got the time to see you.
Today is one of those days when just everything seems to go wrong.
If you'd only give me a chance.
I just keep telling you, young man Is this Is this S-S-Spot?
Good heavens, no.
Spot's an animal.
This is my husband.
Uh, how do you do?
Hello.
Herman, why did you invite him in?
I just explained to the young man that Father can't see him.
Now, Lily, of course he can see Mr. Prince.
Herman, l"Prince"?
Won't you come in?
Please.
Please, Mr. Prince.
That's right.
Mr. Richard A. Prince.
Oh, at last our prince has come.
Then you really have royal blood in your veins?
Oh, yes.
L Thank you.
I understand that's how we got the family name.
Of course, it was a long time ago.
Well, as they say, old blood is always the best.
Yes, uh Oh, thank you.
You know No.
No, thanks.
You're all being so nice to me, l-I can't help thinking there's a catch to it.
It's almost as though I were as though I were being fattened up for something.
Is-Isn't that silly?
Oh, what a sense of humor.
Well, Dick, my boy, I'm ready to do business with your company.
Uh, but, uh, Grandpa, didn't you b-u-r-n the you know what?
Herman, please.
Let me handle this.
I have the forms right here, sir.
Eh, not so fast.
There's just one little thing.
Oh, if it's a matter of money No, no, no, no.
It's not a matter of money.
You see, it's-it's a matter of tradition.
Now, you see, we're from the Old Country, and we have a family custom that, before we discuss a business deal, the party of the second part that's you  Must kiss the youngest member of the family.
Oh.
You mean I have to kiss him?
What we mean is the youngest female member of the family.
Oh.
She's down in the dungeon.
The dungeon.
Tell me, which, uh Which side of the family does she resemble?
No.
No, no, no.
Don't tell me.
Mr. Prince, I have to be frank with you.
Poor Marilyn is well, to put it bluntly less attractive than the rest of the family.
You might say she's the ugly duckling.
And-And you want me to kiss her?
Well, you can close your eyes.
Come on.
And then we talk business.
Then we talk business.
-  - Igor, now mind your manners.
I told you, no snacks between meals.
Uh, Mr. Prince, I'd like you to meet my niece.
This is the ugly duckling?
Wonderful.
!
Now we can go up and discuss the deal.
What What deal is that?
Uh Uh, Mr. -Mr. Prince?
Uh  Mr. Prince?
Uh, Mr. Prince.
Now, sir, about our deal.
Grandpa, tell him.
Well, uh  Dick, my boy, there's a little something that you ought to know.
The Reliable Oil Company is prepared to pay the sum of $50,000 to you to keep your product off the market.
You see, it's like this Did you say keep it off the market?
Yes, of course.
We certainly have no intention of giving up the gasoline business.
All you have to do is keep your formula off the market.
Oh, I think that can be arranged.
What was that last sum that you just mentioned?
$50,000.
Grandpa.
Yes?
What?
Uh, he'll sign the contracts, but we can't take the money.
Can't take the money?
No, of course not.
Not after what he's done for our poor unfortunate little girl.
Besides, the big dummy burnt the formula.
Allow me.
Bats!
Well, that's That's more than generous of you, sir.
L-I must say.
And now if the, uh, "poor unfortunate little girl" has no objections, I'd like to take her out to celebrate.
Well, I can't make the excuse of being too sleepy.
I'd love to.
Good night, Mrs. Munster, Mr. Munster.
Good night, sir.
Say, kids, uh, uh You can have the car, but, uh, remember.
Have it back before 12:00, or it'll turn into a pumpkin.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, Herman.
You're so sweet and thoughtful.
When they made you, they broke the mold.
That doctor always was a butterfingers.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Now, this is what we sent them: "Out of 800,000 subscribers to our magazine, our research computers have selected you as the average American family".
We've repeated that: "Average American family.
"You'll receive $5,000, and our magazine will do a full picture story on your family.
Details to follow".
Who'd the wire go to, Mr. Morgan?
We sent it to "Mr. And Mrs. Herman Munster, Isn't it wonderful, Herman?
They say we Munsters fit the average family statistics almost to a "T".
It's quite an honor for our family to be chosen, and that $5,000 prize will come in handy too.
And it's going to be a cover story.
Can't you just see it?
Our picture in homes all over the country.
Why, with your good looks and my handsome features, I'm sure we'll be a smash.
Well, now.
According to the second telegram, a photographer and a reporter will arrive tomorrow to spend the weekend.
Oh, good.
That'll give me time to hang my new drapes in the guest room.
We want to put on a good front for these people.
- I'm gonna get my best suit down and take it down to be pressed.
- Good idea.
- Oh, and while you're there, have your head blocked.
- Yes, dear.
Oh, and Marilyn, why don't you go down to the beauty parlor and get fixed up.
Ooh, you might get them to give you a vulture egg shampoo.
Yes, Aunt Lily, I will.
Good.
Dad?
Yes, Eddie?
I'll comb the snarls out of Spotty.
And, uh, Grandpa, what are you gonna do to get ready for this happy event?
What am I going to do?
I'm gonna get out of here.
That's what I'm going to do.
Grandpa!
Grandpa, don't you realize what an honor it is to be selected the "Average American Family"?
Think what it'll do for our standing in the community and how Eddie's playmates will all begin to notice him.
Honor?
Why, it's an insult to the family name to be called average.
I happen to be a genuine count, with the blood of princes and dukes flowing in my veins.
Grandpa, that was in the Old Country.
Here in America, no one cares about royal blood.
Spoilsports!
Well, when that reporter and photographer get here, I for one am making myself scarce, and I'm just the one who can do it.
This ruins everything.
We were chosen by statistics.
We have to show two children, a pet, an aged grandfather and a bird.
-  Who?
Me?
- Not you, stupid.
I mean Igor.
I feel just awful about Grandpa acting this way.
I could just lie down and die Ohh.
Again.
Grandpa, I wanna talk to you.
Herman, you can talk yourself green in the face.
I will have nothing to do with being part of an average American family.
It may be the way you're made, but it is not the way I'm made.
Grandpa, give me one good reason why you're against it.
Well, think what this kind of publicity would do to my life story.
Why, if everybody knows me as the typical old grandpa next door, who will believe the fantastic life that I've written about?
Grandpa, when those reporters show up, I insist you be here.
I won't!
I won't!
I won't!
If you make me, I'll turn into a bone and bury myself in the backyard.
Last time you did that, the neighbors' dog dug you up, and we had a terrible time getting you back.
I don't care.
I won't be here.
When those men show up, you are not leaving the house, you understand?
All right.
I promise I won't leave the house.
Good.
Don't worry, Herman.
I won't leave the house.
But as we used to say in Transylvania, there's more than one way to skin a bat.
All right.
All right.
Why is everybody around here so sensitive?
You're booked on the morning flight, and don't forget, fellas: We want real coverage and depth on this average family.
Togetherness and heart in words and pictures.
I think we oughta play it for laughs, satirize the whole thing.
You're all wrong, as usual, Chip.
This is right up my alley.
All heart, these people my kind of people.
I don't care how you handle it.
Just bring me back a story and pictures plenty of pictures.
And for once, see if you two can agree on something.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll get great pictures.
"Mr. Munster polishing his car.
This fascinating shot was taken at a great personal risk in a cockpit of a speeding power mower".
Look.
Stop playing the big-shot war correspondent, will ya?
The boss is right.
These are real people down-to-earth, heartland stuff.
- Why, I might even get a Pulitzer Prize out of this.
- Why don't you knock it off, Len?
You sound like Chester Morris on the late, late, late show.
Grandpa?
Uh, Grandpa?
Oh, Grandpa?
I can't imagine where he is.
He knows the reporters are coming this afternoon.
I guess he's gone somewhere, but the question is when'll he come back?
Nevermore.
Will you stay out of this?
Uncle Herman, I think he's trying to tell us something.
"Dear Mr. And Mrs. Average, Igor and I have flown the coop.
Sorry we can't be there for the picture-taking.
Grandpa.
'"  And he promised me he wouldn't leave the house.
Why, when those men show up and find that one of our statistics is missing, he's liable to call the whole deal off.
Now we'll lose the prize money.
Oh, and we were so looking forward to that vacation cruise on the Dead Sea.
Fiddlesticks!
Now, Herman!
Listen.
The people from the magazine won't be here for a while.
Maybe you can find Grandpa before they get here.
Yes.
And I know all his haunts.
Now, when those men come here, Marilyn, you show them to their room and make some excuse for us.
Don't worry about a thing.
You just go out and find Grandpa.
Right.
We'll check all the places where he hangs out.
Come Come, Lily.
Don't tell me this is it.
Well, the place where we rented the car said this was the street.
There's the number: 1313.
House Beautiful it ain't.
I've seen direct hits that looked better than this.
Let's go see if Ma and Pa Kettle are home.
Hey, Chip, let's call the home office.
Something's wrong here.
I don't see anything very average about this.
Neither do I. Miss Munster?
I'm Marilyn Munster.
You must be the men from Event Magazine.
Yes.
Right, right.
ChipJohnson.
Lennie Bates.
Words.
Pictures.
How you doin'?
Won't you come in, please?
Thank you.
Are you in a hurry to start taking pictures?
Oh, no.
No need to get down to business so soon.
Good.
Then I'll show you to your room.
I suppose you're wondering where the rest of the family is.
Frankly, it hadn't even entered my head.
Well, they'll be back soon.
"Be back soon".
What a doll!
Maybe Grandpa got hungry.
Sometimes he comes here to grab a bite.
You wait here.
I'll see if he's in there.
Was Grandpa in there?
No.
The place is empty.
They must serve terrible food.
Well, let's keep looking.
Grandpa goes down here once in a while to enjoy the damp earth.
I'll see if he's down there.
Grandpa?
Oh, Grandpa?
He ain't here.
Okay.
Okay.
S'all right?
S'all right.
Grandpa sometimes comes here to feed the wolves.
I tell you, Mr. Morgan.
This place is weird.
I think we oughta call it off.
Research must have goofed this one.
Nonsense.
Our computers are never wrong.
They're infallible.
Why, they picked my last three wives for me.
All right.
So So the place is a little run-down.
I mean, what do you what do you expect the average family to live in?
Huh?
The Taj Mahal?
Hey.
We met the niece.
She's a doll.
Now, the rest of the family's gotta be great.
Well, you don't get candy apples off a lemon tree.
Look, you boys come back here with a story, and check it all out.
Make sure that family satisfies our computer to a "T".
I want pets, kids and grandfather.
One thing wrong, and it's off.
And keep Lennie off the you-know-what.
Now, don't worry.
Lennie doesn't have a pint of the you-know-what on him.
- Everything is under control.
- Mr. Bates, your room is ready.
But really under control.
Well, we've checked all of Grandpa's hangouts.
Where could he be?
I think we should've looked for him out at Rose Lawn Memorial Park.
Lily, that's 10 miles as the hearse drives.
Well, he often goes out there to pick up a flower for his buttonhole.
All right.
We'll just have to start looking for him again early in the morning.
It'll mean good-bye to $5,000 if we can't produce him for those pictures.
How could a man who's 400 years old act so childish?
Now, where could he be?
Well, Igor, I promised I wouldn't leave the house, and I didn't.
We'll just hang around up here until those men from the magazine have gone.
Shh.
Will you be quiet, Igor?
They'll hear us.
Just play dead.
So, your folks collect antiques, huh?
Antiques fascinate me.
Tell me more.
Maybe you'd like to see some of them?
Yes.
Yes.
Especially if they're stuck away in some dark corner.
Well, on second thought, it's getting a little late.
I wonder what's keeping your partner.
Oh, he has to unpack all those cameras.
It certainly is a marvelous antique.
What's it called?
"Early San Quentin"?
Chip.
!
Oh, there's the reprieve from the governor.
Well, don't go away, doll.
I'll be right back.
Well, I think I'll say good night now, but I'll see you in the morning.
Okay.
Good night.
What do you want?
I was just beginning to soften her up.
Chip, there's something awfully wrong here.
A man got onto this thing and then turned into a suit of armor.
I suppose the next thing you're gonna tell me is you saw little men.
Well, I was afraid to mention it before, but when we first came in, I did see one run across the hall and then later, he ran up the stairs.
My boy, you need a good night's rest.
It's discouraging, Herman.
Grandpa is just nowhere around.
I know.
How many places are there in a town like this where a man can bury himself?
When I think of losing that $5,000, it makes me so mad I could blow my top!
Well, don't do that, dear.
It's always so messy.
What are you doin' with the binoculars?
No, thank you.
Now, put that away, will you?
No wonder you've been seeing little men.
Now, come on.
Let's go to bed.
We don't wanna look like a couple of weirdos when we meet the rest of the family, hmm?
Put it away.
Chip.
Chip.
Chip, wake up.
Huh?
Huh?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
There's a monster in the hall.
Lennie, ya big dope, will you stay out of the binoculars?
I saw it; I swear it!
He's about seven foot tall, and his head is bolted to his neck, and he's wearing a nightshirt.
I saw it.
Come on.
I swear.
I swear.
Come on.
All right!
All right!
Let go.
Isn't it awful?
It's frightening.
But it was there!
I'm gonna take you to a psychiatrist.
Chip, I swear it.
I saw it.
I swear I saw it.
If you weren't dreaming, what were you doing at the door in the first place?
I was going to get a glass of water.
Well, the big, bad bogeyman's gone.
Go get your water.
Eddie, are you in bed?
Yes, but I can't stay awake.
You'll be able to.
Just lie there with your eyes open, dear.
I'm getting out of here.
Now, look here.
What do you wanna do?
Get us both fired?
I'll tell ya what I'll do.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell you what I'll do.
We'll go through the whole house together.
No.
I'll prove to you that there's nothing here but a gorgeous creature named Marilyn and her harmless, average American family.
Okay?
I'll be with you every minute.
Okay.
Come on.
Gee, you certainly go through an awful lot, Lily, to make yourself beautiful just to go to bed.
Anything for you, pussycat.
Did you hear that?
Hmm?
It's downstairs.
Oh.
Good.
- It's burglars.
Herman, you go down and have a look.
- Do I have to?
Of course!
Go down and scare them off!
Me?
Scare them off?
How?
Herman.
All right.
Just a moment.
Oh, will you hurry?
All right.
Just let me see if it's loaded.
Come on!
I'm going.
I'm going.
It's a little far out, but you don't see any monsters, do you?
So far.
I'm sure I heard footsteps.
Let's look in there.
You see, there's nothing unusual in here, right?
Hey, look.
Aww.
Nice kitty.
Careful.
Looks like an electric chair.
Let's get out of here.
It might be plugged in.
Well, you gotta admit we didn't find anything, right?
Hmm.
I guess you're right.
What's that?
It's just our own footsteps, ya dope.
Our own footsteps, huh?
Then how come they're still walkin'?
We'll look back together.
Shh.
See, ya big dope?
You got me doin' it now.
It's just your imagination.
-  -  - Help!
Grandpa!
-  It's me, Chip.
-  - Herman!
- No!
Not Grandpa!
The burglars!
-   It's me!
Ohh.
Ohh.
Aunt Lily, Uncle Herman, what happened?
There were burglars in the house, dear.
We just chased them off.
Burglars?
Those were the two men from Event Magazine.
Oh, bats!
There goes our $5,000, Herman.
Well, I guess there's only one thing to do.
Oh, darn.
I forgot.
-  But, boss, they are monsters.
- Yeah, yeah.
I saw them.
It was horrible.
Look.
You boys have been at that binocular case too much.
Now, you get back there and get that picture, or you're both fired!
Well, you heard the man.
Back we go.
Four lenses cracked before I got it.
I finally used the strongest one we had, the one for elephant stampedes.
It's magnificent.
Hmm?
What?
Look, we have shown the average American family celebrating New Year's, Christmas, Mother's Day, the Fourth ofJuly and Susan B. Anthony's birthday, but this is the first time we have ever shown the average American family celebrating Halloween.
Boys, you are brilliant.
Send a check to the Munsters and pick up a $1,000 bonus from the cashier.
And congratulations.
Isn't it a beautiful picture, Herman?
Mm.
Yeah, but but look what it says here: "America's Average Family Celebrates Halloween".
Halloween?
What are they talking about?
This is the way we look every day of the year.
Yeah, on Halloween, we put on masks and try to frighten people.
Wait a minute.
It's a mistake.
They switched headlines.
Here's the Halloween picture: "The Pierpont van Schuylers in their latest family portrait".
Why, that's the weirdest bunch of trick-or-treaters I ever saw.
How could a magazine like that make such a mistake?
Say, Herman, you think maybe we could sue them?
Oh Oh, my goodness, no.
I think we should just be good sports and laugh it off.
- Laugh it off?
- Why, sure, Lily.
We're not just the plain old Munsters anymore, you know.
We're the average American family, and I think we owe it to our country to keep our sense of humor.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Good evening, Herman.
Hmm.
Uh, uh Uh, Grandpa.
Grandpa!
I'm-I'm trying to read.
With all that noise, I can't concentrate on the jokes.
Thank you, dear.
Don't I have any rights in this house?
Oh I just opened the window.
Well, sorry, Grandpa, but you let out all our musty air.
Fresh air affects my sinus.
-  - Well, I'm sorry if my creaking old bones are bothering you.
- Oh, stop exaggerating.
- That's right.
- Go ahead, yell at me.
- I'm not yelling.
Oh, yes, you are.
No, I'm not.
You are!
I am not!
Oh!
Stop it, you two!
You'll wake the dead again.
That's all right, Lily.
Go right ahead, take his side.
But I know what's going on.
You just can't wait to see me in my grave.
Oh, Grandpa, we've seen you there lots of times before.
You're acting very childish.
I'm ashamed of you.
Oh, so now you're ashamed of me.
Well, you won't have to be ashamed of this poor, broken-down old man anymore.
The next time you see me around this place, I won't be here.
Now, Grandpa I'm leaving this house for good.
Oh, Grandpa.
Tonight.
Now, why did he have to do that?
Herman?
Yes, dear?
I'm worried.
We wouldn't want Grandpa really to leave.
Now, Lily, believe me there's nothing to worry your pretty head about.
Oh, what with the mood he's in, there's no telling what he might do.
Last time we had a family spat, he turned himself into a frog and lived under the porch for weeks.
Yes, and I've never seen him happier.
He could croak every night.
Aren't you just a little bit worried?
Listen, dear.
Believe me, I know Grandpa.
I'm not gonna lose my head over this.
?
?
Hi, Grandpa.
Hello, Eddie.
You going someplace, Grandpa?
Yes, Eddie.
I'm going away far, far away.
But, gee, Grandpa, where?
Someplace where I'm wanted, where I can feel loved.
Gee, Grandpa, can I go to the cemetery with ya?
I always have so much fun when you take me there.
No, Eddie.
This is not fun and games.
This is facing life in its bitter reality.
You see, the time has come for me to depart.
You really don't wanna leave, do you, Grandpa?
Well, no, I don't, but I think it's best that I do.
Hmm.
You see, Eddie, in the great poker game oflife, it's time Grandpa cashed in his chips.
I bet if Mom and Dad knew you were leaving, they wouldn't want you to go.
Oh, they already do know it.
They do?
Yes, and you don't see them stopping me, do you?
You see, my boy, they don't really care whether I go away or not.
Sure, they care.
I'm going down and tell them you're packing, right now.
No, no, no, no.
I wouldn't want you to do a thing like that, my boy.
No.
Oh, and, uh, by the way, do be careful what you say.
You see, I wouldn't want them to worry too much about a poor, broken-down old man going out into the cold, cruel world.
What kind of a world?
"Cold, cruel world".
Good boy.
Good boy.
Bright boy.
?
?
Mom!
Dad!
Grandpa's leaving!
He's in his room packing his suitcase.
Packing?
Herman, you go right upstairs and stop him.
Now, Lily, Lily.
This is just part of a big bluff he's putting on.
He's acting very silly.
I think he's in his second childhood for the third time.
Sure, Mom.
You shouldn't worry too much about a poor, feeble, broken-down old man going out in the cold, cruel world and cashing in his chips.
Where did you hear that?
Grandpa.
Hmm!
Who else?
Hmm!
Hmm!
Good-bye.
I'm leaving.
I said I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Bye.
Uh, may I?
Can I help you?
No, no.
What are you looking for?
Sailing dates on ships going to, uh, Hong Kong.
Uh, may I?
See?
Right here.
It says there are plenty of good accommodations left in the hold of the ship.
Herman, how could you?
Don't worry, dear.
It's just part of his little game.
Hmm.
After he's through sulking, he'll be back.
- But when?
- Nevermore!
Aw, shut up!
"Don't worry, dear.
He'll be back.
It's all part of his little game".
Oh, Herman, I should have known better.
I still think he'll be back.
Tomorrow morning, we'll go up to his room, open his closet, and he'll be hanging there like always.
No, I don't think so.
A little voice inside me keeps telling me he's gone for good.
Oh, is that what it is?
I thought that we'd left the radio on.
Uh, uh Where's Marilyn?
She was so upset about Grandpa, she went straight to her room after school.
We've got to do something.
Herman, I think we should all go out and look for Grandpa.
Yeah, Dad!
No, no, no, no.
I'm the one who let him go.
I'll go get him.
And don't worry, dear.
I'll bring him back, dead or alive.
Oh, Herman, you're always so optimistic.
- Hi, fella.
-   Poor thing.
I must resemble the local dogcatcher.
Uh, uh Pardon me, sir.
Yeah, Mac, what is it?
Uh, did you happen to see an old man walk by here?
No, I didn't happen to see an old man  I guess it must be easier to work on from the inside.
Did you happen to look Lily, I looked everywhere.
I even looked in the all-night Laundromat.
The woman in there must have thought it was the public bath.
She jumped right in the washing machine.
Oh, dear.
Poor Grandpa.
He won't be with us for the holidays.
He-He'll be back.
I'm-I'm sure he will.
Grandpa.
Nevermore.
Oh!
Now, Lily.
Lily.
Lily, I'm home.
Did you hear anything from Grandpa?
Oh, not a word.
I spent most of the day in his room looking for some sort of clue as to where he might have gone, but no luck.
His room is as clean as a wolf s tooth.
Did you stop by the police station?
No, but I called them from work.
Are they looking for Grandpa?
They weren't, but after I gave them his description, they said they'd send out a dragnet or some sort of net.
Good.
Mom!
Dad!
I found Grandpa in this newspaper.
Oh, not in the obituaries again?
No.
His picture is in this ad.
He's doing his magic act.
"Domino Nightclub presents the "Count.
" Oh, dear.
I hope he doesn't try that-that oh, that fire-eating trick of his.
I certainly hope not.
Uh, uh The last time he tried it, he got the hiccups.
And before they could stop him, he burnt down the theater.
Hmm.
Oh, Lily, I fixed your vacuum cleaner.
Oh, good.
How does it work?
Fine.
See?
Shoots the dust out as well as ever.
Thank you, Herman.
You're very handy.
Uh, would you like to use it now?
No.
No, I just can't concentrate on my housework.
L l-I keep thinking about Grandpa.
I miss him so much.
I know, dear.
I can just see him in his room, sitting there, rocking by the hour.
I know.
I always felt bad we didn't get him a chair.
You know, Herman, I think I'd feel better if I could just talk to him, if I could hear his voice.
Well, listen, dear, I've got an idea.
Wh-Why don't you call him down at the nightclub?
I think I will.
Hello, Operator?
Could you get me the Domino Club, please, on West Elm.
Oh, hello?
Hello.
This is Mrs. Munster.
Could I speak to the Count please?
They're calling him to the phone.
Oh, good.
Hello?
Hello, Grandpa?
This is Lily.
Lily?
Lily who?
?
?
- Lily, your daughter.
- Oh.
Uh, uh Nice of you to call.
What's new?
Grandpa, we miss you so much.
Are you all right?
We're so worried about you.
Worried?
You don't have to worry about this broken-down old man.
I'm doing fine.
My magic act is going great.
I'm filling the club every night.
Oh, all right, Grandpa.
Yes, I see.
Well, if that's the way you want it.
Good-bye.
?
?
Hey, pops.
Just a little warning, pops.
You brush up that corny magic act of yours, or you'll be out in the street.
Yes, sir.
I know I'm a little rusty, but I'm sure I'll be much better in the next show.
Well, ya better be.
We don't want our customers to think we dug you up at the last minute.
Yes, sir.
You see, I'm adding a new trick to my act.
H-Here, let me show it to you.
Now, you see, I take this ordinary vase of flowers.
I make a few magic passes over it.
It bursts into flames, and rockets shoot out.
I'll show you.
Abakazoo!
Abakazam!
I know.
You're skeptical.
Abakazoo!
Abakazam!
But just one minute   Stupid late bloomers!
The guy already left.
Here we are, dear the Domino Club.
Oh, thank you.
It's not very fancy.
According to Grandpa, I thought it would be ultra swank.
Uh, uh "According to Grandpa"?
We should have known.
Uh, Lily, I feel terribly conspicuous dressed the way we are for such a shabby place.
Well, let's hope it'll be nicer inside and not one of those beatnik joints.
If there's anything I can't stand, it's weird people.
What a surprise this'll be for Grandpa.
?
?
This is certainly no place for Grandpa.
I've seen "liver" audiences in a graveyard.
?
?
Pardon me.
Could you give me a light?
Oh, gladly.
?
?
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Tonight, ladies and gentlemen, I shall perform for you one of the most amazing feats ever attempted in the annals of magic.
Here we have approaching an ordinary steamer trunk.
Now before your very eyes, I shall step into this trunk and allow these two gentlemen to lock,  Chain and nail shut the lid of this trunk.
And then at the count of 10, without the aid of any death-defying leap, I shall emerge from this trunk unassisted.
?
?
Remember, ladies and gentlemen, at the count of 10  Unassisted.
Impresario.
You are ready to commence the tabulation?
Ready.
Herman, I've never seen Grandpa do this trick before.
His magic's been getting so rusty.
I know.
The way he's been carrying on lately, he couldn't produce a rabbit on Easter Sunday.
One, two, three, four,  Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
- Ten!
Ten!
- Herman, I don't like this, not one bit.
Ten.
!
Now, now, Lily.
?
?
Now, ladies and gentlemen, we seem to have run into some difficulty.
- Bring on the dancing girls.
-  ?
?
Oh, Herman, this is terrible.
Poor Grandpa.
Excuse me, dearie.
I was just admiring your ring.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, it's simply gorgeous.
Rhinestone?
Uh, no, no.
Tombstone.
?
?
And now  Grandpa will suffocate if he doesn't get out of there.
And now One, Oh, Herman, do something.
I'm going to.
I'm going to, Lily.
Two, Even if he gets mad at me, three, four, I'm gonna get him outta there if it's the last thing I do.
Five Come on, Count!
Count!
Uh, uh Excuse me.
- Uh, may I?
- What the heck is that?
Must be part of the act.
Boy!
What a makeup job.
Oh, so that's the gimmick.
Go ahead.
That's quite an act.
Herman.
What are you doing here?
I'm rescuing you.
I don't need any rescuing.
But Lily and I saw you.
We thought you were suffocating.
Herman, do me a favor.
Get lost!
I'm tryin' to do magic.
All right.
If that's the way you feel about it.
Uh, he'd rather do it himself.
He's a phony.
Ladies and gentlemen, that was an amazing display of strength, but now let's check on the Count.
That Grandpa what a ham.
?
?
More.
!
More.
!
More.
!
More.
!
You were just great, Count.
I want to apologize for all those things I said.
Now, look, Count, I want to give you a contract, and you can write your own ticket.
I'll double your salary, book you all through the East.
I got friends back there who'll take care of you.
In the East!
Oh, I haven't flown there in years.
Come on, Lily.
Oh, Herman.
We've lost Grandpa for good.
Thank you, but I have another booking.
This one is with my family.
Oh!
Welcome back, Grandpa.
But, pops, show business needs performers like you.
I know that, but I found one thing out there tonight.
I need my family more than show business needs me.
Oh!
Boy, there's a real showbiz family for ya.
They even go home with their makeup on.
Grandpa, I hope I didn't ruin your act for you.
I was just trying to be helpful.
Oh, I was never in any trouble, but thanks anyway.
It shows that your heart is in the right place.
Oh, oh Oh, always has been.
Grandpa, are you sure you could have gotten out of that trunk all by yourself?
Of course, Lily.
I was only toying with the audience.
Of course he was.
Hmm.
Oh, it sure is wonderful to be back with my family, especially at this time of the year.
Oh!
My favorite holiday dish plum pudding soaked in brandy sauce.
Here.
Here, let me light it for you.
Come on!
Come on!
W-W-Wait a minute.
What's going on here anyway?
What do you think, I'm a helpless old man?
Grandpa!
Forevermore!
That's my dad.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
No more, Kitty.
You're getting the appetite of a lion.
Marilyn?
Marilyn?
Oh, it's terrible.
It's a disaster.
Well, what's wrong, Aunt Lily?
We'll be disgraced, ruined, wiped off the face of the earth.
Your Uncle Herman is overdrawn at the bank.
Uncle Herman?
I can't believe it.
Down through history this only happened once before in our family when Grandpa overdrew his account at the blood bank.
Did Uncle Herman say anything about this?
Oh, no.
He's too proud.
Why, if he found out that we knew he was broke, he'd never be able to look himself in the face again.
Well, maybe Grandpa could help us out.
He's very well off.
He was.
He was.
But you know the expression "You can't take it with you"?
Well, Grandpa did.
The only trouble was he forgot to bring it back.
Herman, say it isn't so.
Say I heard you wrong.
Grandpa, you heard me right.
Ah, I lent $5,000 to Lester.
You lent money to my son, Lester?
Herman.
Herman, please help me sit down.
You look terrible.
All the blood's drained out of your eyeballs.
Quick, Herman.
Mix me something.
There.
Put in that stuff in in the blue beaker first.
Yeah.
And then that little jar with the green stuff.
Yeah.
And And then that that yellow stuff in the beaker.
A-And top it off with that white stuff that white stuff in the jar.
Yeah.
Ooh.
Oh, there's nothing like a little celery tonic to make you just right.
Grandpa, do you think Lester would lose that money?
It was an investment.
H-He said it was a sure thing.
Herman, you'd better not let Lily hear about it.
She'll be furious.
That Lester is a born loser.
You remember that time he was gonna promote the Patriot of the Year Award for Benedict Arnold?
And that advertising slogan he was gonna make a million dollars with "Don't be half safe take the Titanic.
'" Grandpa, are you trying to tell me that your son Lester is somewhat lacking in business acumen?
No, no.
I'm just trying to tell you that he's a bum!
Aunt Lily, how noble of you to go out and get a job to help Uncle Herman when he's so broke.
Oh, Marilyn, the women of our family have always stood behind our men.
We've always been ready to put our head on the block and our shoulder to the tombstone.
Well, what kind of job are you gonna take, Aunt Lily?
Well, I found the address of this employment agency in the newspaper.
I thought I'd go down and see what they have to offer.
Oh, and, Marilyn, be sure not to say a word to your Uncle Herman.
I don't want the poor lamb ever to know.
Oh, I won't say a thing.
Well, we'll notify you if anything turns up.
Next.
Uh, won't you sit down, please?
Thank you.
Oh.
Sorry.
Name?
Mrs. Lily Munster.
Lily But, uh, if you don't mind, I'd rather use my maiden name.
Well, that's entirely up to you.
Uh, what is your maiden name?
Dracula.
Dracula?
That's a unusual name.
Not at all.
Back in the Old Country the woods are full of them.
I don't want my husband to know that I'm working.
Yes.
Of course.
- Age?
- 137.
No, no.
Not your weight.
Your age.
That is my age.
Uh, what, uh What kind of wor uh work have you done before?
Well, during the war, I did some volunteer work.
In a defense plant?
No, I was an airplane spotter.
Oh.
Yes, you stood on the roof, and you watched for planes with binoculars.
No, I sat in the dungeon and watched for planes with a crystal ball.
Oh, it was quite exciting to help out.
Grandpa used to fly test patterns for us.
H-He had his own plane?
Why would he need a plane just to fly?
Mr. Haggerty.
Mr. Haggerty, a new job just came in.
Uh, I'll take it myself.
Calm yourself, Mr. Haggerty.
You're quivering.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I'll I'll be all right, Fred.
Now, uh, what about this new job?
Well, a gypsy tearoom called.
They want somebody to read palms.
I told them naturally we couldn't fill a position like that You won't believe this, Fred, but I think we can handle it.
What?
Madam.
- Did you ever read palms?
- Read palms?
Why, of course.
Doesn't everybody?
You're leaving for the parlor early today, pussycat.
Uh, we're going to have a meeting.
We've gotta go out and drum up some new business.
Uh, no more of this waiting around for people to drop over.
Don't worry, dear.
Everything will turn out just fine.
Remember, every silver cloud has a dark lining.
Thank you, dear.
It's little inspirational thoughts like that that keep me going.
He's gone.
Now, if I'm not home in time, you put the cauldron on to boil.
Maybe I ought to quit school and get a job too, Aunt Lily.
Oh, no.
No, no.
You need an education.
You'd be surprised at the number of men who will marry a girl for her brains.
Well, is the work hard at your job?
Very easy.
Why, I could read palms with my eyes closed.
Ramon is very pleased with my work.
Ramon?
He's the owner of the tearoom.
Well, what is Ramon like?
Well, he looks a little bit like Cary Grant.
Poor man.
I better get going.
Now, I'll be home before your Uncle Herman.
Well, now, if Uncle Herman knew you were working for a man, don't you think he'd hit the ceiling?
No, no.
He doesn't do that anymore.
The last time he did, the rain came in, ruined the rug.
Hi.
Anybody home?
Oh.
What are you doing home?
I thought you just left for the parlor.
I did, but things are awfully quiet down there.
Uh, you can't tell the salesmen from the customers.
So I decided to take the day off.
Well, that's the way it goes in your business.
You know, you can't always operate in the black.
Uh, Lily She's not home.
Where is she?
Uh, Herman  I'd like to talk to you.
Sit down.
Go ahead.
Now, Herman, I wasn't going to tell you about this, but I think it's best for all concerned that it be brought out into the open.
Now, I've been watching Lily for the past few days.
She's been leaving the house just after you do and doesn't get back until just before you come in.
Uh Uh Uh, where does she go?
Well, that's just it.
She doesn't say.
Well, she's probably just going shopping or something.
Wearing her best clothes?
Her finest jewelry?
Her most exotic perfume Chanel Number 13?
Grandpa, I just couldn't believe that Lily would do anything wrong.
Oh, I don't either, but if you did suspect something was wrong, I have a little plan that would enable both of us Grandpa!
A-Are you suggesting that I would stoop so low as to check up on Lily?
That's just what I'm doing.
What's your plan?
Right.
Tomorrow morning you leave for work just as usual.
And then I will be able to go down outside Grandpa.
Uh, uh, uh, she just went by.
I know.
I saw her.
Good morning, Ramon.
Buenos días, señora.
Herman, your wife just went into that tearoom with a man.
I know.
Doesn't that strike you as strange?
Yes, it does.
She's never been a tea drinker.
Herman, let's you and I sit down here and have a little talk.
You know, Lily, I can't tell you how pleased my wife and I are at the way you've been reading palms.
Oh, thank you.
You've both been so kind to me.
Look at that manhole cover.
I never saw that happen before.
I hope there's nothing down in there getting ready to explode.
Lily, things are a little slow today.
I thought maybe if the passersby saw you sitting here in the window reading my husband's palm, we might stir up a little action.
I'd be glad to.
I'll get you some hot tea.
Well, 20 years in the tearoom business and I've never had my palm read.
Huh?
Oh.
Well, now.
Let me see.
Can you see her?
Yeah.
I can see her.
Can you see what they're doing?
Yes, I can see what they're doing.
- They're holding hands.
- Why would they be doing that?
Well, l I don't think they're exchanging fraternity grips.
I always like to check both hands.
Can you see what they're doing now?
He's holding both her hands.
Grandpa.
Uh Uh, you you know something?
- What?
- They don't even have any tea on the table.
I've seen enough.
Let's get out of here.
It's okay with me.
What was that?
Uh, perhaps something did explode.
What did you have to go and do that for?
Herman, this is no time to be writing a letter to Dear Abby.
That tearoom Casanova is moving in on your wife.
Uh Uh Grandpa, let's keep a cool head.
It's just that I want to give Lily a chance to come to me and explain the whole story.
Uncle Herman, you're here.
Yes, I'm here.
Why shouldn't I be?
Uh, this is still my house, isn't it?
Yes, but I'm surprised to see you.
Oh, by the way, Uncle Lester called, and he's very anxious to get in touch with you.
Oh?
Uh, it's probably about the, uh, m-o-n-e-y.
Uh, Marilyn, dear, we have a more important matter to discuss right now.
Uh, I'll talk to Cousin Lester later.
Oh.
Aunt Lily.
Hello, Marilyn.
Oh, I was so afraid I wouldn't get home before Herman that I practically ra Oh.
Well, hello, dear.
Can you spare it?
Uh, aren't you home rather early?
Uh, husbands are apt to do that occasionally.
Come home unexpectedly.
Can I make a cup of tea for anybody?
Uh, Grandpa, why don't you relax?
I'll go in right now and fix some supper.
Uh, Lily.
Yes, Herman?
Uh, Lily, I'm not one to pry, but I was just wondering where you've been today.
Who, me?
Oh, well, I just went downtown shopping.
Oh, shopping.
Uh, did you see anything you liked?
Oh, my, yes.
At this time of the year there are all kinds of goodies to catch a girl's eye.
Well, I was just, uh I was just wondering if you did anything unusual today.
No.
No, I didn't do anything today that I haven't done every day for the past two weeks.
Come on, Marilyn.
Well, that does it.
I'm going right down to that tearoom and have it out with that home-wrecker face-to-face.
Good boy.
Uh, but there's just one thing, Grandpa.
This may lead to bloodshed.
Ooh, Herman.
This is no time to be looking at the bright side.
Get down there.
Uh, just a moment.
Aunt Lily, Cousin Lester's on the phone.
I wonder what he wants.
I haven't heard from him since the last time he went bankrupt.
Hello.
Lily, this is your brother, Lester.
Is Herman there?
No.
He He just went out for a little walk.
Well, I guess it's all right to tell you now, Lily.
A while back Herman loaned me $5,000.
And now a big deal has come through for me, so I have the money to pay him back.
Herman loaned you $5,000?
That's right.
I'm coming right over there with the money now.
Uh So that's why our bank account is empty.
I'm gonna tell Grandpa.
Grandpa.
I'm busy down in the lab.
!
Well, drop whatever you're doing and come on up here.
And so, thinking that Herman was broke, I got this job reading palms in the tearoom.
So that accounts for that fellow we saw holding your hand.
Right.
And all the time I was just reading his palm.
Oh, the joke is on us.
Oh, no.
What's the matter, Grandpa?
Herman is on his way over to have it out with that fellow you worked for.
Oh, that's terrible.
I'd better phone Ramon and warn him.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Lily.
What?
Your husband's coming over to do what?
Now, Lily Now, now, now.
Lily, don't you worry.
No.
My wife's gone home, but, uh, I've handled jealous husbands before.
Mmm.
What sort of a looking fellow is he?
Tall, good-looking, average typical family man.
All right.
Fine, Lily.
Lily.
Lily, now don't you worry about a thing.
Good-bye.
Is everything okay, Lily?
Well, he said not to worry about a thing, but I think we ought to go over there just in case.
Aunt Lily, is something wrong?
We have to go out for a while, Marilyn.
Now, when Cousin Lester comes, you ask him to meet us at the Golden Earrings Tearoom.
Chihuahua.
Uh, uh, please, sir, I have to talk to you.
Uh, uh, please, sir.
I have an important matter to discuss with you.
Now look here.
I just want to  Oh, dear.
Oh, my goodness.
I must have spoken too harshly to him.
Mister.
Mister?
Uh, uh, say, mister.
Uh, look.
Uh, uh, uh, mister We're too late.
Herman clobbered him.
Mister, uh, I wouldn't have hurt you.
But, you see, I was a little upset.
And you'd be upset too if your wife, the loveliest person in the whole world, uh, uh, started falling out of love with you and started chasing after somebody else, you see?
We Mister?
Uh, mister.
You're You're not even listening.
Herman.
Herman, I'm listening.
And believe me, he doesn't mean anything to me.
I was just working for him reading palms.
Herman, Lily knows all about you lending money to Lester, but everything's okay now because he's on his way over to pay you back.
Well You mean you thought I was broke?
Th-That's why you came to work here?
That's right.
Lily.
Oh, Herman.
Baby doll.
Pussycat.
Sister, dear.
I'm here!
Oh, Lester!
Lily!
Oh, my baby brother.
Herman!
Lester, you're a sight for sore eyes.
My boy!
Daddy!
And according to this line, you will live a long and prosperous life with the woman you love.
Golly.
Oh, uh uh, don't quit now.
More fortune-telling?
No, more hand-holding.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Oh, Herman, it's you.
Yes, dear.
I, uh I forgot my key.
I didn't want to break the door down again.
It always makes such a mess.
How were things at the parlor, dear?
Business has been kind of dead all week.
That's nice.
Oh, Herman!
Eddie's been wanting to talk to you ever since he got home from school.
He's in the living room.
Hey, Pop!
Pop!
Hey, Pop, could we go on a camping trip?
Could we, huh?
A camping trip?
Yeah, on account of you never take me camping.
And today in school, some kids were braggin' about their parents takin' them hunting and fishing in the woods.
And all you ever do is take me on picnics in the cemetery.
Could we, Pop?
Please!
Huh?
Well, I, uh You know, Herman, as good parents, maybe we should take Eddie on a camping trip.
I guess we could put up with a few days of fresh air for Eddie's sake.
Oh, boy, could we, Pop?
Could we?
Please!
Well, uh, you know, Lily, I just might be able to swing it this weekend at that.
I mean, if any work piles up down at the shop, I'll just tell them to keep it on ice till Monday.
Gee, that's neat, Pop.
Wait'll I call the guys and tell 'em I'm going camping.
Now, Marilyn has to stay home and study for exams, but I'm sure Grandpa will want to go.
He just loves to get close to the soil.
You know, Lily, I think we're all gonna enjoy it.
I think it's a good idea once in a while for the Munsters to get out and meet nature face to face.
Hmm.
Uh, Lily, Grandpa and Eddie have the car all loaded up.
They're going to bring it around front.
Marilyn, are you sure you won't be frightened staying here alone?
Of course not, Aunt Lily.
How could I be frightened staying in a friendly old house like this?
Come on, everybody!
Shadow Pine Lake, here we come.
Come on in, Herman.
I'll drive for awhile; then you can take over.
Good-bye, Uncle Herman.
Good-bye, dear.
Good-bye, Aunt Lily.
Don't forget to feed Spot.
He's no trouble at all since he learned to open those pet food cans with his fangs.
Uh, but, dear, keep an eye on him.
The last time we left him alone, he ate the grandfather's clock, and he ticked for eight days.
- Okay.
I'll watch him.
-  So long, Raven.
Good-bye!
Thank you very much.
Enjoy your stay.
That guy looked kinda familiar.
Didn't he camp here a few weeks ago?
You got me.
So many people go through here, one face looks like another to me.
Thank you, my good man.
Did I say one face looks like another?
Fourteen years in this park, I've never seen anything like that.
Maybe I should report this to Superintendent Haskell.
He always wants to know about any suspicious-looking characters that show up.
Yeah.
Say, uh, you don't think that was a UCLA debating team on tour, do you?
I don't know, but I'm sure going to tell Mr. Haskell about them.
Herman.
Herman, please!
I asked you never to pound stakes when I'm around.
You know it gives me heartburn.
Oh, uh, sorry, Grandpa.
I forgot.
Pop, when are we gonna start fishin'?
Uh, in a minute, Eddie.
As soon as I'm finished pitching the tent.
Herman, dear, that tent's right out here in the open where it's bright and sunny.
You really should have pitched it in the shadow of those trees.
Then we could take advantage of the gloom.
You know, you're right, Lily.
I should have thought of it.
You should have mentioned it earlier, Lily.
It's gonna be quite a nuisance to move the tent now.
Grandpa, I'll take care of it.
- Where do you want it, dear?
- That will be just fine, sweetheart.
No.
No, I think a little bit to your left.
And now a little forward.
Uh, a little to the right, Herman.
There!
If there's anything I hate, it's a smart-aleck robin!
Before I go off duty, Mr. Haskell, I thought you should know about a party that came in the east gate this morning.
Suspicious-looking bunch?
Well, they sure looked weird.
Rough-looking man, woman with a cape, some old fella looked like a warmed-over zombie and a kid.
I'll have the boys keep an eye out for them.
We caught a wild-looking crowd like that last year trying to break into the inn.
What kind of a car did they have?
Fancy hot rod.
All hopped-up.
I'll put the word out.
Might be a new kind of middle-aged juvenile delinquents.
Eddie, if you two men are going to catch some fish for lunch, you better hurry.
Yeah, Pop.
Show me how to cast.
All right, son.
Come on.
Now, to really get distance, you lean back like this and really let her go!
Ah!
They should be ready in about a minute, Frank.
Let's go tell the girls.
Uh-Uh-Uh, that was just one of my short ones.
Boy, that was neat, Pop!
You can't even see where it went.
Reel it in, Pop.
See if you get anything.
All right, Eddie.
Keep pulling, Pop.
I do believe I have something.
Boy, that's the neatest-looking fish I ever saw.
Mm.
A-And it seems to be cooked.
I guess they have a lot of hot springs around here.
Cast the line again, Dad.
Over that way.
All right, Eddie.
All right, Lily.
We're ready to eat.
- Did you catch three more fish?
- No, we did better than that.
- Look!
- Oh!
Barbecued chicken.
Oh, how thoughtful!
It looks delicious.
I knew the game commission was stocking the lakes, but this is the best fishing spot I've ever seen.
- Where are you going?
- Well, we've got the chicken, now I'm going to try for some dumplings.
Good night, Mom.
If there's any thunder and lightning, be sure to wake me up.
I wouldn't want to miss it.
I will.
Now close up your sleeping bag.
Here you go, dear.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Herman, isn't it a lovely night?
Yes.
Uh, I hope the moon doesn't come out and spoil it all.
You know, Lily, Herman, getting out like this is great.
It reminds me of those wonderful nights in the Black Forest back in the old days.
That's the trouble with you, Grandpa.
You live too much in the past.
Well, I had a lot of good friends back in Transylvania.
Oh, that sounds like one of them now!
Oh, I wish how I was out with the boys.
Grandpa, you know that here in America, you just can't go running around at night with a pack of good-for-nothings.
Of course not.
Besides, you always come home with your paws all muddy.
Rules, rules.
We're supposed to be on a vacation, aren't we?
You'd think I'd be allowed at least one night out to howl.
You just stop that kind of talk.
The last time you felt like this, you ended up in Kansas City with that police dog.
I'm sorry, but I'm just so homesick for my four-footed friends, that's all.
Well, I, for one, am going to bed.
And then I'm getting up bright and early with my rod and reel and catch me an omelet or a pizza or something.
Come on, Lily.
Oh, Grandpa, you coming?
I'll be going to bed pretty soon.
I just want to sit here a few minutes longer and listen to the call of the wild.
Well, bonne nuit.
Bonne nuit.
Oh, you're so right.
That's what I always say.
Oh, if you had been with me in the Old Country I could tell you stories that would break your heart.
Herman.
Herman, wake up!
Hmm?
What?
Oh.
Oh!
Uh-Uh-Uh, good morning, Lily.
Herman, Grandpa's gone.
Gone?
What do you mean?
I went to wake him up this morning, and his sleeping bag was still rolled up.
He never went to bed last night.
?
?
Hey, I found a station on the radio.
I didn't think it would work out here in the woods.
Oh, never mind that, Eddie.
Your grandfather disappeared during the night.
Uh, where could he have gone?
When we went to bed, he was sitting right by the fire.
I don't know.
He kept talking about the call of the wild, and he had that funny look in his eye.
We interrupt this program for a local news bulletin.
Forest rangers in the Shadow Pines area report the capture of a full-grown wolf during the night.
While several wolves are known to inhabit this region, the one now held at the Shadow Pines Ranger Station is a rare species whose native habitat is the wilds of Transylvania.
Officials are baffled as to how this animal Oh!
There's no doubt about it, Herman.
They're talking about my father.
Mom, can I go to the ranger station and pat Grandpa?
Oh, Eddie!
Herman, this is terrible.
What are we going to do?
Lily, I don't know what you're going to do, but I'm going fishing.
He's a grown man, several hundred years old.
So why should I let him spoil my vacation?
L-I mean, if he can't control himself, he ought to sign up with Werewolves Anonymous.
Well, if you won't do anything, I will.
I'm going to that ranger station and claim him.
Lily Yes, Willard?
I just thought I'd tell you we patrolled the entire area and there's no sign of those suspicious-looking people we had the report on earlier.
So I've What in the world is that?
I think those jets are buzzing the park again.
The wildest-looking car I ever saw.
There's something getting out of it.
It's a woman.
Looks like she's still in her sleeping bag.
Yes, miss.
May we help you?
I understand from the radio you picked up a Transylvanian wolf last night.
That's right.
He's out back in one of our cages.
I'd like to claim him.
He's mine.
- He's your wolf?
- No, he's my father.
I don't quite understand, but perhaps we better go out and have a look at him.
Did you hear what she said?
She called it her father.
I've heard of people treating pets as one of the family, but this is a new one.
That's him.
Well, aren't you ashamed of yourself?
You've had us so worried.
Y-You know you're too old for this sort of thing.
Well, what have you got to say for yourself?
-  - Oh!
Excuses.
Always excuses.
You and your childish pranks.
If it isn't a wolf, it's a bat.
Now, you change yourself back into a person this instant and then you drive me back to camp.
- What?
-   What do you mean you forgot how?
Grandpa, you've been changing yourself into a wolf and back for 200 years.
L-I can't understand it.
It's like riding a bicycle once you learn, you never forget.
Well I guess I'll just have to take him home as is.
Would you happen to have a leash I could borrow?
I'm afraid, miss, this wolf is in the custody of the Park Department right now, and we couldn't possibly turn him over to you.
Not turn him over to his own daughter?
L-I can't believe that the Park Department would try to break up a happy family.
It's positively un-American.
I'm sorry, but the wolf is being shipped to the New York Zoo tomorrow morning  When the matter, thank heavens, will be out of my hands.
I've never heard anything like this in all my lives.
Believe me, you haven't heard the last of this.
I'm going right back to camp this instant and inform my husband.
- See ya later.
-  What do you think, Mr. Haskell?
Why couldn't the Park Department have assigned me to Squirrel Valley where all the nuts are up in the trees?
Li Lily.
You want me to go trespassing on government property and steal Grandpa?
Hmph!
What do I look like, some kind of thug?
Oh, Herman.
We've got to get him out of his cage tonight.
Tomorrow they're shipping him off to the New York Zoo.
Yeah, you gotta get Grandpa.
Some kids are always braggin' about their grandpas in heaven.
What are they gonna say when I tell 'em my Grandpa's in a zoo?
Herman, forget your scruples.
Think with your heart.
All right.
All right, Lily, I'll go.
And I'll get the big dummy.
I'll ruin my vacation, spoil Eddie's good time.
I'll go get him.
But I'll tell you one thing from now on, the most dangerous thing Grandpa's gonna turn into is a one-way street.
Sounds almost human at times, doesn't he?
He sure does.
That woman who was here before do you think she could have any connection with those suspicious-looking people the ranger at the gate reported?
Willard, I know she was dressed kind of weird, and she did talk to the wolf, but this is the tourist season.
Gotta get used to these oddballs.
Grandpa?
It's just one of those silly park bears looking for food.
Yeah, he's a big one.
They just look bigger in the dark.
Get a dishpan and something to pound on and get rid of him.
Yeah, right away.
They're all just big babies, huh?
Grandpa, will ya knock it off.
I've come to get you.
Good Grandpa.
Grandpa, this is no time to get sloppy.
What was that?
Scat!
Was it a bear?
Yeah.
He took the wolf in his arms and ran through that fence.
Willard, may I remind you that one of the prime rules of the forestry service is "no drinking on duty".
The rare species of wolf captured yesterday was released from its cage last night by what was first reported to be a large bear.
Well, that's silly.
There were no bears around there last night.
Just me.
Further investigation of the scene now leads park authorities to suspect a man wearing a mask or some sort of disguise.
Rangers at part exits are stopping all cars as the search Oh, this is terrible!
Grandpa, how do I know if the food's good in the New York Zoo?
Will you get in the car and lie down while I figure some way to get you out of this park!
Come on, Grandpa.
I got a biscuit for you.
Come here, Grandpa.
Come here, Grandpa.
Now let me see  Okay.
Nothin' here.
Thank you.
You can drive on.
Well, that's the 50th car we've checked today so far.
Still no sign of any wolf.
Uh-oh.
Here comes that crazy lookin' bunch that came in the other day.
Better really check this one.
Good morning.
Good to see you.
Uh, we've enjoyed your park immensely.
Fine.
Mind if we take a look inside?
Not at all.
Uh, be our guest.
Hi there.
Hi.
Is that a kid?
Well, it's not quite a wolf.
Okay.
You can go.
Oh, uh, thank you.
Good day.
Lily, i-i-it's all right.
W-We're safe now.
All right, Grandpa.
You can let go of your tail now.
Easy does it, Grandpa.
Grandpa!
Easy does it.
Easy-Easy does it.
That's right.
Grandpa, I am not going too fast.
And don't be a front seat driver.
And then your Uncle Herman got Grandpa out of his cage, but the rangers were looking for him, so we had to smuggle him out of the park.
Oh, that's a shame, Aunt Lily.
So many annoying little things can happen on a picnic.
Did you find anything, Herman?
Yes, I found Grandpa's de-wolfing potion.
This ought to do the trick.
Sure hope it turns him back again.
Certainly hope so.
I'd hate to have to take Grandpa out for a walk every night for the rest of my life.
What did he say?
He said, "I'll drink to that".
Well, go ahead, Grandpa.
Get with it.
-  -  What happened?
One minute I'm out in the woods, next thing I'm here chasing a cat.
Uh, well, you see, Grandpa Herman.
Don't tell him.
It's too awful.
Uh, all I can tell you is that if you ever pull a stunt like this again, your zip code address is gonna be the Central Park Zoo!
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Sounds like someone's at the door.
Oh, fiddlesticks!
Now look what you've done, Lily.
Oh, Herman.
And never mind that.
I was hoping you'd come home.
We have a much more serious problem.
Really?
Did Grandpa blow up the dungeon again?
No.
But Marilyn came home from school in tears.
She said she'd been asked not to return to college.
What happened?
I don't know.
She was too upset to talk.
Poor thing's up in her room now crying her eyes out.
Oh, my.
I did that once when I was younger and had a terrible time getting them back in.
Well, we'll just have to get her down here and find out what the trouble is.
Do you suppose it could be her marks?
Well, it could be.
Uh, after all, she's your sister's child, you know.
She doesn't have the Munster brains like I do.
Is that so?
And what line were you in when they passed out the brains?
You're forgetting, dear.
I didn't stand in line at all.
They brought everything to me.
I got curb service.
Oh, Herman.
Imagine, throwing you out of school.
I'll fix that college.
I'll turn myself into a California student and upset the whole campus.
Now take it easy, Grandpa.
Uh, there must be some explanation.
Here's the notice they gave me at school.
I just don't understand it.
"Tuition in arrears for the last quarter"?
The college told me I couldn't come back till it was paid.
Oh, I was just so ashamed.
But, Lily, you handle the checkbook.
Uh, didn't didn't you ever pay this?
I'm almost sure I did.
I'll look it up.
This is most embarrassing.
No one in our family has ever been thrown out of school since the time they caught Grandpa hanging from the rafters at Vassar.
I only flew in there to get out of the rain.
For two weeks?
See now.
I paid the gas bill, the telephone, our water-hardening service But can't you find a check stub for the tuition?
I'm sorry, Marilyn.
I was so sure that I paid it.
Well, maybe it's just one of those checks I forgot to enter.
Well, we can't let them treat our niece this way.
That's right.
I'll go down there and handle it.
- I'll throw a scare into them.
- Uh, no, no, Grandpa.
I'll take care of this.
I'll go down to that school tomorrow and straighten the whole thing out.
Oh, thank you, Uncle Herman.
But But will you be able to take time off from the parlor tomorrow?
I think I can duck out around 4:00 and the boss will never miss me.
Anyway, he's gonna be busy all afternoon interviewing new box boys.
What'd you say this kid's name was again, Coach?
Mallory.
Moose Mallory.
He's been playin' high school basketball somewhere in Kentucky for the past six years.
It took him six years to get through high school?
Jerry, our scouts' reports show that this guy's got everything footwork like a gazelle, hands like a gorilla, and he's tall as a giraffe.
Who's sponsoring him?
The S.P.C.A.
?
Okay, so he's a big dumb ape from the hills.
But Dean Haggerty doesn't know that yet.
We're gonna enroll the Moose on a scholarship, and by the time he flunks out, our team will get national recognition, and yours truly will have left Westbury for bigger and better things.
That Mallory was supposed to be here at 3:30.
Do you suppose the bus was late?
I don't know.
His first time in the city.
Maybe we should have met him.
That big goon could be wandering around like some kind of a zombie.
I guess you need a college education to figure out the signs.
Oh, uh Uh, uh, pardon me, sir.
Could you tell me how to get to Oh.
Uh, sorry.
L I thought you were alive.
Uh, you look just like my wife's brother standing there.
Coach, maybe we oughta call the bus station.
It's almost 4:30.
We'll give this Moose another   Oh, uh, uh, pardon me, gentlemen.
Uh, could you help me?
Do you suppose this is Has to be.
Couldn't be two like that.
Come on in.
This is the place you're looking for.
Oh.
Thank you.
I'm looking for the dean's office.
Uh, there's a matter of tuition I'd like to straighten out.
Don't worry.
You'll get to see the dean, and we'll straighten out that little matter of tuition.
Fine.
Uh, first I'd like to ask a few questions.
Have a chair.
Uh, all right.
Uh, could we get rid of this?
Now, how tall are you?
I'm, uh, 7 foot 3.
In your stocking feet?
No.
In my stocking feet I'm 7 foot 4.
I wear very thick socks.
Well, you're gonna take a pretty big sweat suit, but I think we've got one around you can squeeze into.
- Sweat suit?
- Yeah.
No use you seeing the dean till we run you through a little tryout.
- How are you at passing?
- Oh, pretty good.
I passed two trucks and a station wagon on the way over here.
Jerry, show him where the locker room is.
Right, Coach.
Come on, Moose.
Moose?
You college kids and your nicknames.
Bus from Nashville and points south now unloading.
Well, uh, what do you think, Pa?
Purty fancy bus depot, Moose.
Look, they sell them paperback novels right out in the open.
I don't see none of them hotshot college fellers here to meet ya.
Well, uh, the bus was two hours late on account of hittin' that mule.
Maybe them hotshot college fellers got tired of waitin' on us.
They musta.
Reckon we-uns will have to track down the college ourself.
Well, we best get walkin'.
Walkin'?
Look, just as soon as you start basketballing it for that Westbury College, you ain't gonna have to do no more walkin' have your own "cornvertible".
You done lost me, Pa.
How can a little old college basketball player afford a "cornvertible"?
Son, if you keep actin' as dumb as you look, us Mallorys are in real trouble.
You just play with that little old ball and leave the thinkin' to me.
Sorry, Pa.
Well, we best get walkin'.
Give me your hand.
I just don't understand, gentlemen, why I can't see the dean now.
Because one of the rules here says that before we see the dean, we have to play a little basketball.
Now, we don't mind doing that for Coachie, do we?
Well, I guess not.
But I'll just bet you they don't have rules like this at Princeton.
Come on, Moosie.
Let's see you sink a couple of baskets, huh?
- Uh, uh, that that basket down there?
- That's right.
Sure.
If If If it'll get me to see the dean.
But why don't you give yourself a break and go near the foul line Wow!
Sensational!
Yeah, that's great.
Let's see you do a few layups.
You're fantastic.
You really think so?
Just watch this.
He's great.
!
Look at that.
!
Holy mackerel.
!
Wow.
!
Now can I see the dean?
Son, after that demonstration, you don't need to see the dean.
Uh, but there's a matter of tuition.
My boy, you just sign this paper, and believe me, you'll never have to worry about tuition again.
Really?
Oh.
Well, thank you very much.
Uh, uh, can I go and change my clothes and leave now?
Sure, go ahead.
Yeah.
We'll be seeing you, Moose.
Oh.
Thank you.
Jerry, my boy, we're gonna have the greatest basketball season in the history of Westbury.
Yeah, Coach.
This Moose Mallory is just about the  Excuse us.
Do you reckon we're in the right place?
No, fellas.
The course in television acting is just down the hall.
We don't know nothin' about no playactin'.
This here's Moose Mallory, the basketball star, and I'm his pa.
He can't be Moose Mallory.
Moose Mallory was just in here, and the coach signed him up.
Sure.
We just Jerry.
Look.
"Herman Munster".
You mean that that wasn't Moose Mallory that we signed up before?
Must have been some other athlete that stumbled in here by mistake.
Well, then this guy must be the real Moose Mallory.
What are we gonna do?
Look, let's not argue with fate.
Whoever this Munster is that fell in our laps, he's gonna make any other basketball player look like a creep.
But how are you gonna get rid of these hillbillies?
They came here all the way from Kentucky.
Easy.
I'll just politely and graciously explain the matter to them in the fine sporting tradition of college athletics.
Moose.
Yes, sir?
The, uh, job is filled.
Huh?
Get lost, ya bum.
That's right, Marilyn.
Tomorrow morning, you can go to college without a worry in the world.
They assured me your tuition is all taken care of.
Oh, thank you, Uncle Herman.
Did you have any trouble down there, dear?
No.
Uh, not a bit.
They have a rather strange rule before they'll give you an interview, but after a brief workout in the gym, they were most cooperative.
A workout in the gym?
Yes.
Uh, you see, when I walked in, there were these two men  Hey, Pop.
!
Pop.
!
The evening paper just came, and it's got your name in it.
My name?
Yeah.
Right here on the sports page.
On the sports page?
"Coach Roger Denman this afternoon predicted a winning season on the courts with the enrollment of a local athlete, Herman Munster, at Westbury College".
Local athlete?
You, Herman?
You enrolled at college.
Boy, Pop!
Wait till I tell the guys!
Now why would he do a thing like that?
You went down there  Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
The The, uh There must be a mistake.
A-All I did was put on a sweat suit like they asked me and shot a few baskets.
They said that was one of the rules.
Then when I signed that paper, they said the tuition was all taken care of.
They meant your tuition, not Marilyn's.
Ooh, Herman, you signed a contract to play basketball on a scholarship.
Oh, boy!
Sometimes I think you just don't have enough sense to come in out of the rain.
Oh, yes, I do.
I've I've done it lots of times.
Herman, you're so gullible.
Why, this is even worse than the time you went to that television show and almost wound up as Queen for a Day.
Now they still won't let me back in school tomorrow.
Oh.
You've goofed it again, Herman.
Well, don't just sit there with that vacant look on your face.
Aren't you the least bit worried about the the mess you've gotten into?
You're You're darn right I'm worried.
I'm trying to figure out a way to get in shape before the basketball season starts.
"Herman Munster".
Moose, that must be the fella that rinky-dinked you out of your basketball scholarship.
Yeah.
As soon as we hit the bus depot I shoulda knowed this town is full of fancy dudes.
How come?
When I tried that 10-cent machine in the washroom, instead of giving me a pocket comb, it squirted "prefume" all over me.
I don't notice it none.
Well, maybe I didn't get enough on me to take.
Moose, is that Munster slicker's address in the paper?
Uh, "1313 Mockingbird Lane".
Come on.
Let's go.
Me and you are gonna find that Yankee, and we're gonna rearrange his bones Kentucky-style.
Hot dog!
His face'll look like Annie Lou Humphrey when she fell in the feedin' trough and them swill-happy hogs just about tromped her to death.
Now, Herman, I phoned the college, and they said the coach will be working in his office all evening.
Yes.
Grandpa and I want you to go down there right now and straighten this mess out so that Marilyn can go to school tomorrow.
But, Lily, I'll I'll be so embarrassed.
Those nice men might yell at me.
Oh, Herman.
What are you anyway?
A man or a mouse?
Now, Lily.
After all these years, you you can't tell the difference?
Now, Moose, I ask ya did you ever see a house like this in all your born days?
I sure didn't, Pa.
Ain't nobody back home could afford nothin' this fancy.
I don't care if the Munsters do live in a mansion.
It ain't gonna slow me down none.
Yes?
What do you think, Pa?
I think the hogs already tromped on this boy's face.
And then when this coach feller throwed us out and we read that you had latched on to Moose's scholarship, we just come over here to marinate your gizzard in sheep-dip.
Uh, uh, good heavens.
I'd hate to put you to all that trouble.
As a matter of fact, Herman signing up to play basketball was only the result of a mix-up.
Yeah, of course.
Why, when you knocked, he was on his way down to straighten it all out.
He was.
Weren't you, Herman?
Yes.
L l I was at that.
In the interest of fair play and, uh, my gizzard.
Well, now, that makes a mite difference, don't it, Moose?
It does iffen I get my athletic scholarship.
Uh, uh, uh, tell you what.
Why don't you nice gentlemen sit here while I go down and speak to that coach.
Oh, that's a fine idea, Herman.
And while you're gone, I'll try to make our friends feel at home.
See you later.
Gentlemen, make yourselves comfortable.
Well, thank you.
You'll have to pardon me, mister, for staring at your suit, but  If you was to come to our town duded up like that, folks would bury you before you could blink an eye.
Oh, thank you.
I'll consider that an invitation.
Oh, my, Grandpa.
That fire's gone out again.
Would you mind?
Oh, I'd be delighted.
And I'll go and fix some tea.
Hey, Pa.
What is it, Moose?
You're closer to my feet than I am.
Would you mind puttin' out the fire?
Okay, son, but don't expect me to do it every time.
Thank you, Pa.
What do you mean you won't play basketball for this noble institution of learning?
Are you out of your skull?
Oh.
Oh.
Uh, no, sir.
L I haven't been out of it in years.
But, you see, I just cannot accept this basketball scholarship.
Oh, you want more money?
No, sir.
You want a convertible?
No, sir.
A little something under the table, huh?
O-Of course not.
It's just that this basketball scholarship does not rightfully belong to me.
It belongs to another.
I believe you should withdraw my name from the team and award this honorarium to Mr. Mallory in the interests of justice and fair play.
He is out of his skull.
Come right this way, Mr. Mallory.
This here is our kitchen.
Oh, a separate room for eatin' vittles, and now look at all these "modren cornveniences".
Lookee here, Pa.
There's no pump.
The water just comes splattering right outta the pipe end.
Yeah, son.
That's, uh That's one of them new, uh, automatic dishwashers I've heared tell about.
- Oh.
- And this is our icebox.
Ooh, land of Goshen!
Look at all them eggs.
- And big uns too.
- Oh, yes.
And we keep our own vultures out in the back.
Ooh-ee.
L-I'd sure hate to reach under one of them critters when they was nestin'.
Wouldn't you, Pa?
I didn't know you had company, Aunt Lily.
Oh, Marilyn, this is Mr. Moose Mallory and his father.
How do you do?
I'm mighty glad to meet you, ma'am.
I declare, you're prettier than a bucket full of hog livers.
Oh, thank you very much.
Yeah, I guess, uh, you could say she is the pick of the litter.
Marilyn, uh, why don't you take the young man out back and show him our garden?
Oh, all right.
Ooh-ee.
Oh, uh, be careful.
D-Don't step on the poison ivy.
It's just beginning to bloom.
Oh, ma'am, I sure hope that your husband can work things out and get my son on that basketball team.
I just can't wait to move up here and live high on the hog like y'all do.
Munster, will you knock it off?
You signed this paper, and you're going to play.
- Yeah.
Where's your sportsmanship?
- I am not tearing up this contract and signing Mallory.
But I tell you I won't play!
I will not play!
I won't!
I won't!
I won't!
Now, uh, uh, uh, what are you gonna do about it?
Like I said, I'm going to, uh, tear up this contract and, uh, sign Mallory.
And now for the local sports scene.
Moose Mallory, the sensational high-scoring forward of Westbury College, led his team to its 15th straight victory.
The Moose scored 68 points and set an all-time conference record.
Coach Denman sees his team going to the national championships undefeated.
That's what I wanted to hear.
And now for the local weather It's nice to know the boy's doing so well in college.
And he has you to thank for it, dear.
Well, Lily, if we can't help a young man up the ladder of success, we're pretty sorry excuses for human beings.
Good night, everybody.
That's my date.
- I'm going out with Moose Mallory.
- Oh.
Good night.
That sweet boy must see something in Marilyn that we don't.
Well.
What are you gonna do, Grandpa?
I'm gonna do a little peeking at Moose and Marilyn.
That's what I'm gonna do.
Well, why didn't he say so?
Come on.
You know, Herman, it must be hard for a boy like Moose to struggle through college on a scholarship.
You're right, Lily.
I'll bet it calls for many sacrifices.
Mmm.
Wow!
Get a load of that car.
He He must have a job working nights at the school cafeteria.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Here's the okay from Washington on our latest ham operator application.
Call letters are W6XRL4.
These two-way radio rigs are getting to be quite a popular hobby.
Yeah.
I just hope this man realizes that being able to communicate with people all over the world carries a serious responsibility.
Mm.
What's the name on this one?
Uh, "Herman Munster.
Mockingbird Heights".
Oh, I'm sure he's a solid citizen with both feet on the ground.
?
One bright and shining light?
?
That taught me wrong from right?
?
I found in my mother's eyes?
?
That's funny.
The man in Australia cut me off in the middle of"My Mother's Eyes".
Oh, Herman.
Will you knock it off with that thing?
Look, if you wanna communicate with people around the world, here, use my crystal ball.
You put over $400 into that thing, and you can't even get the roller derby on it.
Yes, Herman, come on to bed.
You've talked to six countries, and nobody wants to hear "My Mother's Eyes".
I'll come to bed later.
Lily, I've always wanted a ham radio set.
And now that I've got one, I'm gonna listen in on distress signals and notify the authorities and prevent disasters and noble things like that.
Aw, Uncle Herman, you're all heart.
Oh, no, I'm not.
There's lots of other junk in here.
Come on, Marilyn.
Let's go upstairs.
Look, Herman, take my advice.
Don't try to be noble.
Just learn to mind your own business.
That's just what I've been doing ever since I told that Napoleon fellow to take that shortcut through Waterloo.
Calling W6XRL4.
Calling W6XRL4.
Grandpa.
That's me!
That's-That's me!
Hello, hello?
This is W6XRL4.
Come in, come in.
This is Milan, Italy.
Italy.
Are you the one who was singing "My Mother's Eyes"?
That was me.
That was me.
Hmm!
That is correct.
That is all.
Over and out.
Well, I don't call that very neighborly.
Calling CQ.
Calling CQ.
Uh, come in, please.
How do you like these new walkie-talkies that I got for my birthday?
Boy, they're great.
We can play some neat games with them.
Let me have one.
Okay.
Aw, they're no fun.
I'd rather go home and watch my Grandpa blow up things.
Aw, go on, Eddie.
I don't think you have half the fun at home you say you do.
Hey, Walt, you go over on the other side of the wall, and we can talk to each other.
We'll pretend we're spacemen.
Okay.
Can you read me?
Can you read me?
I read you loud and clear.
Over.
Hey, where you goin', Eddie?
Aw, I'm goin' home.
This is kid stuff.
See ya later, Roger.
Bye, Walt.
You know, sometimes I just don't dig that Eddie.
Me too.
I wouldn't mess around with him except for the neat way he opens up cans with his ears.
Hey, Walt.
I got an idea.
Why don't I be a spaceship, and you be a control tower on Mars?
Okay.
Get over there behind the wall.
This is spaceship X-14.
Now circling spaceport.
Come in, spaceport.
Ah.
This is Spaceport Mars calling X-14.
Tracking you on gamma beam.
Stand by at plutonium layer for landing instructions.
Mars.
This is spaceship X-14.
Vector reading: 9-0-3.
Now firing retro-rockets in sequence.
It is Mars.
It is Mars!
That's a spaceship!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
This is W6XRL4, planet Earth.
Hey, Walt.
What's this "planet Earth"junk?
What do you mean?
Listen.
This is W6X4L W6XRL4, planet Earth.
Calling Mars.
Calling Mars.
Some other kid must have one of these things, too, and he's trying to get in on the game.
Yeah, but it's getting late.
We gotta get home.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
Planet Earth, this is spaceship X-14.
Now in landing pattern for Spaceport 7, Mars.
Will have to break off.
Will have to break off.
But you can't break off.
L-I've gotta talk to you.
Please, fella, don't break off.
Sorry.
Will resume transmission same time tomorrow, That is all.
But I got Mars.
I got Mars.
I got Mars!
I got Mars!
And Lily and Grandpa said this was a kid's toy.
Hah!
Wait till I break this news to the world.
Your Majesty, ladies and gentlemen, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I modestly accept this Nobel Prize in Science.
Herman!
Will you please come to bed?
I'm dying to get some sleep.
Lily, I'm much too excited to go to go to sleep.
And besides, I just may be sitting on top of one of the biggest scientific breakthroughs in history.
Well, whatever it is you're sitting on, get up off it and come to bed.
Lily, I was speaking figuratively.
And that's no way to talk to a future Nobel Prize winner.
Oh, Herman.
!
Come to bed.
!
Yes, dear.
Herman.
Herman.
Herman!
Oh!
Oh, Grandpa.
You gave me such a fright.
I thought you were a man from Mars.
What are you talking about, Herman?
What's going on down here?
You've been sitting down here for hours.
Grandpa.
What would you say if I told you that in two minutes at the stroke of 4:00 I, Herman Munster, am gonna be in communication with the planet Mars?
I'd say that if you keep talking this way, they'll take you away to the funny farm.
There.
Now.
It's 4:00.
You'll see.
You'll see.
Boy, Roger, we'll have more fun playing spacemen than ever now that your father bought you this genuine synthetic plastic spaceship.
Boy, I hope we can get that kid who we talked to yesterday on the walkie-talkie.
We said we'd call him back at 4:00.
Calling W6XRL4.
Come in, Earth.
Come in, Earth.
This is Mars.
I've got them!
I've got them!
Are you trying to tell me that's Mars?
It's not the weather report.
Hello, Mars?
This is W6XRL4.
Where are you?
We have just penetrated through substratosphere and made our first landing on Earth.
Over.
They're here!
They're here!
They-They've landed on Earth!
All right.
All right, Herman.
Don't get so excited.
It's only people from Mars.
People from Mars?
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Will you wake up, you dummy!
We're making history.
Hello.
Hello.
Come in, Earth.
Come in, Earth.
I guess somethin' happened to our friend from Earth.
Maybe the kid's parents made him go take a bath or somethin'.
Aw, let's come back after supper.
Maybe we can get him then.
You really think it's a kid?
He must be.
He sounds so stupid.
Now, Grandpa, Grandpa.
You heard them.
They're men from Mars, and they've landed on Earth.
We have to go call the air force.
They have a department that checks on unidentified flying objects.
Not so fast, Herman.
We can't just go and call the air force.
You want 'em to think we're a couple of nuts?
Oh.
Heavens, no.
Before we call the air force, we have to have concrete evidence.
But where are we gonna get evidence?
All we have to go by is a voice on the radio.
Don't worry, Herman.
I'll find that spaceship with my direction finder.
Come on.
I've got it in here somewhere.
Let me see.
What do we have here?
Oh.
A rabbit's foot carried by General Custer.
Mother's Day card from Lizzie Borden.
Compass off the Titanic.
Ah!
Here it is!
Yeah!
My radio direction finder.
Direction finder?
Grandpa, that's just an old-fashioned divining rod.
True, true.
But I had it transistorized last month.
Grandpa.
Yeah?
If we find this spaceship, you and I will be famous all over the world.
Hey, Mom.
How come Grandpa and Dad aren't having dinner with us?
Well, Grandpa said they had to go out tonight on important business.
But Grandpa didn't even take his shovel.
Something's up, Aunt Lily.
They weren't their usual selves.
They looked very strange when they went out.
I don't know what's the matter, but Herman's been acting funny ever since he got that ham radio set.
Oh, but he does need a hobby.
He works hard all week.
That's true, Marilyn.
You know, Herman took up golf once, but he had so much trouble getting together a foursome.
Hey, Mom, maybe Dad's out playing poker with some men.
When he comes home, you'll have to yell at him and make him sleep on the sofa.
- Eddie.
Where do you get ideas like that?
- From television.
You see, Marilyn, it's just the way I told you.
Those shows on television about horrible families have a definite effect on children.
Grandpa, we've been following that divining rod for over an hour now, and we haven't seen a Martian yet.
Don't worry, Herman.
We'll find that spaceship before the night's over.
Well, I certainly hope so.
The only thing it's led us to so far is a shortwave diathermy machine.
That lady looked very upset when she saw us peering in her window.
Will you stop worrying, Herman?
She'll be down off the chandelier before morning.
Look, Herman!
It's found something.
You see?
I told you it'd work.
Grandpa, they're down there.
Right.
The Martians are hiding down there.
Hi, Martians.
Are you down there?
You big dummy!
Why didn't you tell me it was set for "Water"?
What are ya squawking about?
You could've got a face full of scrap iron.
Calling W6XRL4.
This is spaceship X-14.
Would somebody come in?
Would somebody please come in?
Please?
Gee, Rog, I wonder where that other kid is.
He hasn't been on the air since 4:00.
Maybe he's a little shrimp and can't stay out this late.
Let's keep on trying for a little while longer.
Hey, Herman.
We're getting something.
Look.
It's over here.
Oh, boy!
I hope it's not another false alarm.
Come on.
Look!
Herman, a spaceship.
Grandpa.
We're making history.
We're Galileo, Columbus and David Susskind all rolled into one.
Look, Herman.
There are two Martians by the ship, and look how little they are.
Just like in the comic strips.
Come on.
We'll welcome them to planet Earth.
Hello there!
Ahoy, Martians!
Go!
Go!
They ran away.
I guess they're just not used to Earth people, but can you imagine anyone being afraid of us?
Well, maybe their standards of beauty aren't as high as ours.
Grandpa.
What?
I'm getting scared.
Those Martians might come back with a ray gun and disintegrate us.
I'd feel like a perfect fool if they did.
Let's at least get some concrete evidence.
We'll take a picture of the ship we can show to the air force.
Good idea.
Say "cheese".
Will you knock it off and take the picture!
"Cheese".
Hmm.
And you say you and your son-in-law took this photo last night.
That's right, Captain.
You see, he's been in voice communication with Mars for the past few days.
You mean he's been talking to the little people up there.
Yes.
He has a ham radio.
A radio.
That must have made it a lot easier.
Oh, of course.
As soon as the Martians told us that they were going to land, I got out my divining rod to help track them down.
You have a divining rod.
Yes, and it's transistorized.
All I have to do is set it for "Martians," and it led us to their spaceship on a vacant lot.
There were two little men there, and, as soon as they saw us, they ran away.
I wonder why.
You see, I don't know either, but we felt it our patriotic duty to bring it to the attention of the government.
Well, I can't tell you how much we appreciate your coming in here and taking up our time like this.
What?
You mean that's it?
We discover a spaceship and Martians, and it's just "How do you do, hello and good-bye"?
Oh, no.
I can assure you that this photo will be processed through proper channels.
Uh, Captain, if you don't mind, this is very important to me.
- I'll wait outside.
- Excellent.
Sergeant, come in, please.
Aunt Lily, that was Uncle Herman's boss on the phone.
They're looking for him down at work.
He didn't even go to work today, Marilyn.
He's playing with that ham radio again.
They said they were taking inventory down at the parlor, and Uncle Herman's the only one who knows where things are.
Hello?
This is W6XRL4 calling spaceship X-14.
Come in, please.
Come in, please.
X-14, X-14.
Come in, come in, wherever you are.
We were standin' here playing Martian last night, Pop, and those two big guys came along.
They had on real scary masks and yelled at us, and one of them was carrying a big stick.
Why, they oughta be ashamed of themselves.
One thing I can't stand is a wise guy bully.
Listen, Roger, I want  Calling X-14.
Come in, please.
Come in, please.
That's the guy now, Pop.
Here, give me that thing.
Hello.
This is X-14.
Oh, I'm so very glad I got you.
It was very rude of you to run away last night.
- Look, who is this?
-  Why, I'm W6XRL4, one of the Earth people.
You sound very, uh, big.
Are you the head Martian?
Yeah, I'm the head Martian.
You know what I'm gonna do, buster?
If I ever run into you, I'm gonna break your arm off and shove it down your throat!
Hmm.
Well-Well, you just can't do that, Mr. Martian, because you don't know where I am.
So there.
Well, in that case, I guess I'll just have to blow up the planet Earth.
Oh, my goodness!
Lily!
Lily!
Lily!
The world's coming to an end.
And it's And it's all my fault.
There, there, dear.
Herman?
Lily?
Is anybody home?
Marilyn?
Herman, what are you doing?
Grandpa, the world's coming to an end, and we're hiding out till it's over.
Herman, will you let us out of here!
He keeps talking about men from Mars blowing up the world.
It's true, Grandpa.
While you were out, I talked to the head Martian, and he got mad at me and started calling me names and said he was gonna blow up the world.
Herman, will you pipe down a minute and listen?
That was no spaceship we found.
The air force identified it as a child's toy sold in every department store.
And those two Martians we saw?
It wasn't them.
It was two kids playing spacemen.
- You're kidding.
- Kidding?
Look.
"Made in Japan"?
There you are, Herman.
No Martians, no spaceship, no end of the world.
Now what do you have to say for yourself?
Well, that's the way the ball bounces.
What's this, a delegation?
We just came down here to get you away from that radio.
That's right, Herman.
It's caused us nothing but trouble.
Don't worry.
I'm just trying to get some music so I can relax.
Maybe Lawrence Welk or someone.
But, Uncle Herman  Come in, spaceport.
Come in, please.
This is spaceship Astro-70 calling Mars.
Calling Mars.
Hmm!
Will you listen to that?
Hello, spaceship Astro-70.
Spaceship Astro-70.
This is Earth.
Lay off it, you big dummy!
No one's gonna fool me the second time.
My, those Earth people are getting rude.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Herman, has Eddie come home from school yet?
Uh, I don't know, Lily.
I just got home myself.
I had to stay a little late at the parlor and lay out some things for the boss.
Well, I'm about to fix supper, and I want to ask him about dessert.
So, let me know when Eddie comes in.
- Hmm?
- I said, will you let me know when Eddie comes home?
Oh.
Yes, dear.
I'll never go again!
Never, never, never!
You can do anything you want to me!
I'll never go back!
Not in my whole life.
!
I don't care what you do to me.
I won't go back even if I die.
Never, never, never, never!
I'm through with school.
Never again!
I wouldn't go back if I died a hundred-million thousand times.
!
Lily.
Oh, Lily.
Yes, dear?
I think Eddie's home from school.
But, Herman, if Eddie said all those things about being through with school, there must be a reason.
Didn't you even ask him?
Well, maybe they just sent him home.
Kids are always playing pranks.
I remember when I went to school.
Some of the kids used to put the girls' pigtails in the inkwells.
Of course, I put the girls in the inkwells.
Grandpa, please.
Did you ask him why he was so definite about quitting school?
Well, no.
With Little Orphan Annie in such a mess, I guess I just didn't get around to it.
Well, it's hard to concentrate on two things at once, you know.
Oh, Herman, you make me so angry.
Now, I want you to go upstairs right now and have a father-and-son talk with Eddie.
All right, dear.
All right.
But wouldn't it be better if Eddie came down here, so I could sort of lean on the mantel while we talk man-to-man?
- Why in the world would you want to do that?
- Oh, I don't know.
I just always thought Robert Young had great success leaning on the mantel.
Oh.
Oh.
Herman, will you get upstairs!
Yes, dear.
Eddie.
Uh Hello in there.
Uh, it's me.
Um, your father.
Herman Munster.
Uh Uh, may I come in?
Sure, Pop.
Uh, Eddie, I came up here to have a little talk with you.
Uh, man-to-man.
Mom made ya, huh?
No, I wouldn't say your mother made me.
Uh, naturally, I'm curious to know why you said all those things about quitting school.
Well, then, how come you didn't say anything when I came home?
All you did was sit there and read your old newspaper.
Eddie, your father's a very busy man, and you must realize that when I come home, I have lots of business problems on my mind.
The solution to which often depends on a thorough and concentrated perusal of world events in the newspaper.
Boy, that Little Orphan Annie must be in a real jam.
Oh, she is.
But, you know, I think Daddy Warbucks is Eddie.
That is not the point.
The point is I came up here to find out why you've suddenly turned against school.
It's just that I can't go back there ever again on account of what happened today.
Eddie, whatever the problem is, you can tell old Dad.
Well, today at recess the kids made up a nickname for me.
- And they called me by it.
- They called you a nickname?
Hmm.
What in the world could anyone think of to call you?
Oh, it was awful, Dad.
Wherever I went, some kid popped up and called me Oh.
- Called you what?
- I can't say it.
It's too awful to repeat even to my own father.
Eddie, as your father, I demand to be told.
- What's the nickname?
- It's It's Shorty.
Shorty?
Yeah.
And they made it up for no good reason, except I'm the shortest boy in my class.
I see.
Eddie, do you know what a very wise man once said?
What?
He said, "Sticks and stones can break my bones, but names can never hurt me".
That's because nobody ever called him Shorty.
Why do I have to be short?
Why can't I be big and tall like my hero?
Eddie, I don't know who this hero is that you're talking about, but, uh, take it from me, he's probably not worth looking up to at all.
Lots of so-called heroes are just conceited, vain, good-for-nothings as a rule.
But, Dad, the hero I'm talking about is you.
Oh.
Well, Eddie, there are exceptions to every rule, aren't there?
Please, darling, eat.
I'm eating.
I'm eating.
- I'm talking to Eddie.
- Oh.
- Herman.
- Yes, dear?
I know you've had a talk with Eddie, but I don't think we should allow our child to be tormented in school any longer.
I feel that we should complain to the teacher, the principal and, if necessary, to the Board of Education.
Why go through all this red tape when I can solve this problem with a plain, old-fashioned spelling bee?
What's a "plain, old-fashioned" spelling bee?
Well, you see, I invite all the little boys and girls who call Eddie "Shorty" to a free party, and then, when they get here, I cast a spell over them and turn them into kangaroos.
Gee, that sounds great, Grandpa!
Will you do it?
No.
Grandpa will do no such thing.
That's right, Grandpa.
I'm sure if there's one thing Eddie doesn't need it's your broken-down magic.
Ha!
Gee, Dad, how am I gonna face the other kids in school tomorrow?
They're still gonna call me Shorty.
Eddie, I'm sure it's strictly a psychological problem.
And I'm sure that you can overcome it with the proper psychological attitude.
In other words, plant both feet firmly on the ground and keep your chin up.
I'll try, Pop.
It's okay to have your feet firmly planted on the ground, Eddie, but if you keep your chin up that high, you're a sucker for a left hook.
Oh, sorry, Grandpa.
Shh.
Not so loud.
I don't want your father to hear that I'm teaching you about boxing.
Ooh.
That man is so opposed to violence, if he found out, he'd kill me.
Okay.
How's this, Grandpa?
That's pretty good.
Now, keep your hands up high and your weight evenly balanced.
Now should I try to hit you?
Oh, not yet.
I have to work out a plan of strategy for you.
Now, we'll pretend that I'm one of your classmates and we're standing in a school yard waiting to fight because I called you Shorty.
And just as we're ready to go, you point behind me and say, "Hold it.
A teacher is coming".
See?
And then as I turn to look  Left and right in the stomach.
Got that?
Okay.
Now, let's get set.
Hold it.
A teacher's comin'.
Where?
Hey, that works great, Grandpa.
- You're telling me.
- But isn't that fighting dirty?
Only if you use it against girls.
Try it again, okay?
Now get set.
Hold it.
My father's comin'.
Not "my father".
"A teacher is coming".
Want to bet?
Oh.
Hiya, Herman.
What's new?
Grandpa, I want you and Eddie to take off those boxing gloves right now.
Oh.
Are these boxing gloves?
Yes, they are.
Eddie, you know we're wearing boxing gloves?
L I wonder where they came from.
Yeah.
Me too.
Grandpa, get 'em off.
I am really disappointed in you.
Imagine.
A grandfather training his own grandson in brutality.
But we didn't even get to brutality.
I was just starting Grandpa, I said no violence, and I mean no violence.
Hmm.
You know, Eddie, I love him, but there are times I'd like to bite him right in the throat.
Good night, Grandpa.
You're going to bed?
I have to get plenty of rest so I'll have enough energy to cry all day tomorrow when the kids call me Shorty.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Come back.
You won't have to cry all day tomorrow.
As a matter of fact, you'll never have to cry again because somebody calls you Shorty.
Why not?
Why not?
Because your adoring grandpa is gonna give you a magic potion that will make you grow six inches overnight.
Six inches?
Maybe seven.
Did you ever use it before?
Did I ever try it before?
I once gave it to a pirate friend of mine who was only five feet tall.
- Did it work?
- "Did it work"?
Didn't you ever hear of Long John Silver?
It's what is known in the trade as a magic milk shake.
Six inches?
Overnight?
Yeah.
Six inches.
And when you wake up tomorrow morning, you look in the mirror, you'll see the tallest boy in the class.
Bottoms up.
Good, good.
Now, nighty-night and sleep tight.
Lily, today is a school day.
The child belongs in school.
With a beard?
Oh, Uncle Herman, you can't expect Eddie to go to school when he looks so different from all the other kids.
Eddie Herman, Herman.
Speak gently.
He's in a state of shock.
Eddie, uh, come upstairs.
I'll give you a quick shave.
It won't help.
That's funny.
I thought I heard a noise.
It was me.
I said it won't help.
I heard it again.
I think it's coming from that chair.
Hmm.
I can't understand it.
Nobody's sitting here.
Oh, come on, Herman.
Knock it off.
Will you stop with the silent treatment?
Why won't a shave help?
Well, at the rate Eddie grows whiskers, he'll have five-o'clock shadow by 9:00 a.m. And whose fault is that?
He spoke to me!
He spoke to me!
He did!
My daughter's husband spoke to me.
See?
I want you two to stop fighting.
Now Now you make up and bury the shovel.
I said I was sorry, didn't I?
Oh, Grandpa, sometimes saying "I'm sorry" just isn't enough.
Amen.
Some magic milk shake.
Well, how was I to know I had inferior ingredients?
Now he's blaming it on the ingredients.
That's right.
It must have been the he-frog.
The what?
The he-frog, as distinguished from the she-frog.
You see, the recipe called for the powdered shinbone of a he-frog.
Only they just don't make 'em the way they used to.
I should have saved that one from the 15th century.
Boy, those he-frogs from the 15th century, they were terrific.
I remember once I said to Queen Isabella - Eddie, don't scratch it.
- But it itches.
I think there's a hunk of bacon in there from breakfast.
I don't care.
Don't scratch it.
Mommy will run the vacuum cleaner through it later.
Herman, Eddie should see a doctor immediately.
Uh, I agree.
Why don't you take him down to see our family doctor Dr. Dudley.
No.
No.
I think you should take him.
After all, you are the boy's father, and it's a very serious problem.
I still wish you'd take him.
Why?
Because if I walk down the street with a boy wearing a beard, everybody's gonna stare at me.
That's why.
Oh, nonsense.
The least you could do would be to phone the parlor, ask for the morning off to take your son to the doctor.
That's true, Herman.
And I have a clever idea how to disguise Eddie so you won't be embarrassed when you walk down the street.
Oh, Grandpa, don't try any more of your magic on him.
No, Grandpa.
Don't you try turning him into anything.
I have no intention of hopping across town with a bearded kangaroo.
Don't you worry, Herman.
Eddie, come with me.
Eddie, you know who you look like?
Who?
Mitch Miller.
I'm sorry, Eddie.
I'm sorry.
I was only kidding.
Come on.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
All right, Miss Fairchild, next patient.
Are you emotionally prepared?
E-Emotionally prepared for what?
Mr. Herman Munster.
Oh, no.
I'll never forget the last house call I made there.
I was writing out an order for an autopsy when Mr. Munster double-crossed me and sat up in bed.
Well, today we have Mr. Herman Munster and son.
And son?
Mr. Munster had the guts to become a father?
Apparently.
Do they, uh, look alike?
No.
The little boy is much shorter.
That's not what I meant.
Do they look alike in well, for lack of a better word, the face?
Why don't you peek in the waiting room and see for yourself?
All righty.
I will.
Oh, no.
Mr. Munster's face is bad enough.
Imagine what his son's must look like if he has to cover it with a paper bag.
Shall I show them in now?
Yes, but you better have Miss Hansen stand by with an anesthetic.
For the patient?
No.
For me.
Oh, uh Uh, good day, Dr. Dudley.
Good day, Mr. Munster.
And what, uh  I mean, uh, who have we here?
Uh, this is my son, Dr. Dudley.
And, uh, what's your name, little man?
Edward Wolfgang Munster.
Pardon me, I didn't quite get it.
Uh, Edward Wolfgang Munster.
Oh.
Uh, will you, uh, please both be seated?
Oh, thank you.
Okay, Eddie.
We're gonna let the doctor see your face.
How old is little Eddie Wolfgang again, Mr. Munster?
He's 10.
Ten.
Excuse me just a minute.
All righty.
Shall we have a go at it again?
Oh, my goodness.
Has he had it since birth?
Uh, the head?
Oh.
Oh, yes.
That's the original.
The beard.
Oh.
Uh, only since this morning.
His grandfather gave him a frog-leg cocktail yesterday to make him grow, but it just grew a beard.
Excuse me just a minute.
You want a snap diagnosis?
Will a snap cure go with it?
Yes.
- Shoot.
- Edward Wolfgang's beard is the result of a certain metabolic imbalance, induced by what appear to be metaphysical or esoteric stimuli unknown to present-day medicine.
I see.
And the cure?
Lay in a big supply of paper bags.
Eddie, don't get your beard in your soup.
- Uncle Herman.
- What?
- Didn't Dr. Dudley say anything constructive?
- No.
When I rejected the paper bag theory, he suggested that Eddie get used to a new nickname Fuzzy.
That's even worse than Shorty.
We all know who we have to thank for that.
For your information, Herman, I'm gonna make it up to him.
- How?
- I'm gonna make him my partner.
- A partner in what?
- Well, you remember that potion that Eddie drank?
How could we forget it?
I'm gonna mass-produce it and sell it at three dollars a bottle as a sure cure for baldness.
Eddie, Eddie, sit up straight.
I'll make a fortune, and I'll split with him 60-40.
What's the matter with 50-50?
You want me to split 50-50 with a 10-year-old kid?
- Grandpa, I don't want you to do anything.
Just - Eddie, be careful.
Look!
- What happened?
- Well, the soup's disintegrated Eddie's beard.
She's right.
Dunk it again.
No.
No.
Don't move.
Look.
!
The The beard's gone.
Thank goodness.
I wouldn't want to go through life with a son who looked like General Grant.
There goes my surefire cure for baldness.
- Is it really gone?
- Look in the mirror and see.
Yippee!
Well, I don't know how this reflects on my cooking, but my child comes first.
Uh Uh, Lily, Eddie.
Please, sit down.
- Eddie.
- Yes, sir.
Now that your problem is solved, have you learned a lesson?
- I think so.
- What?
I'll never tell Mom I don't like her homemade soup again.
- That's not what I had in mind.
- It isn't?
The lesson I want you to learn is it doesn't matter what you look like.
You can be tall or short or fat or thin or ugly or handsome, like your father, or you can be black or yellow or white it doesn't matter.
What does matter is the size of your heart and the strength of your character.
Eddie, do you understand what your father means?
- Mmm.
- Well, now, Eddie, now that you've solved one of the little problems of growing up, let's get on with our meal.
Herman, you know something?
What, Grandpa?
You're all right.
You aren't perfect, but you're all right.
Thank you.
Hello, Lily, dear.
Hello, Herman, dear.
Herman, you've gotta talk to Eddie.
Yes, he's up in his room crying.
What happened today?
Well, he was playing baseball with some other boys in the neighborhood, and he struck out with two out and the bases loaded.
Poor kid.
He must feel awful.
Um, I'll go upstairs and talk to him.
Herman, Lily, I've got an idea that can solve this whole problem.
What?
What?
If I could get ahold of a bat a baseball bat once used by Stan "The Man" Musial I could take it down into the lab, crush it into a fine powder, so he would be able to digest it.
I remember once saying to
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
But I tell you, Herman.
If it has to be a pet, our cat would be ideal.
Lily, you're just being stubborn.
If Eddie is going to enter anything at the school pet fair, Spot is just the animal.
He's a typical boy's pet.
Oh, Spot.
There's nothing clever about him.
Just tell me one thing he can do besides chase trains.
Well, let's put it up to Grandpa.
Grandpa, uh, which one of our pets do you think Eddie should take to the pet fair playground?
There's no question about it.
Our cat.
Or Spot?
Neither.
Igor.
Igor?
A bat?
Certainly.
Didn't Eddie say that one of the prizes was for intelligence?
Does that Spot have sense enough to hang from the rafters by his toes?
Can that cat fly down to the corner store for the evening newspaper?
Spot must be intelligent.
L-lf not, why isn't he extinct like the rest of his species?
But don't forget, Herman.
One of the things they judge the children's pets on is good grooming.
Spot can win that too.
I told Eddie to work on him and make him look his very best.
Hey, Dad.
I don't think Spot wants to be entered in the school fair.
He's hiding under the stairs and won't come out.
- Now, Eddie, please.
- Can't you do something, Uncle Herman?
- Marilyn - Will you forget about Spot?
He's nothing but a big, stupid baby.
- Just a minute, Grandpa.
- Yes.
Now, wait a minute, everybody.
You can handle this, Herman dear.
You coax him out.
You all seem to be forgetting.
I have a way with animals.
Hmm.
Come on, Spot.
Come on out, Spot.
Come on, Spot.
Be a good boy.
- This is your Uncle Hermie.
-  Now, Spot, come on out of there.
Come on out of there.
Spot, you're being a very bad boy.
You want to go to the school pet fair with Eddie, don't you?
Poopsy?
Well, I guess he seems to be a little bit reluctant.
But, gee, I gotta have a pet to take to school.
Eddie, if we leave Spot alone for a while, sooner or later he'll get hungry and come out looking for somebody.
Herman, I don't care what you do.
You'll never be able to get Spot to behave himself in school.
Eddie, I still think you should take our cat.
But, gee, he couldn't win anything.
He's just a plain, old everyday house cat.
-  - Well, I guess you're right.
In my opinion, Eddie, you ought to take Igor to the pet fair.
Oh, that bat is the most beautiful thing that flies.
Well, okay, now that I think of it, Igor would be good.
He'd be smaller.
How do we know he'll go for this?
You know what happened that time we took him duck hunting.
That was terrible.
He tried to fly south with that flock of mallards.
Six weeks later, he came walking home with his wings full of buckshot.
Good morning, Eddie, Grandpa.
Man, am I excited.
I bet I'll be the only kid with a real, live, honest-to-goodness Transylvanian bat.
Well, as long as we couldn't talk Spot into entering, I guess we'll have to settle for this silly fly-by-night.
You big dummy!
Igor, come back!
Goodness me.
What happened to him?
Wh-What happened to him?
You insulted him.
That's what happened to him.
Igor.
Mom!
Mom!
Mom.
!
Mom.
!
There he goes.
Oh, Eddie, what's the matter?
Pop said mean things about Igor, and he ran away.
I can't be the only kid in school without a pet for the fair.
Oh, don't blame your father too much.
Igor's always throwing tantrums.
Sometimes I think he's nothing but a spoiled bat.
I can't go to school today.
All the kids are gonna make fun of me.
Grandpa, I'm really ashamed of myself.
I shouldn't have opened my big mouth.
I let my boy down.
I'm a miserable excuse for a father.
You know, Herman, there's a lot of ham in you.
Don't blame me.
They had to use what was available.
Don't you worry, Herman.
Eddie will not be disappointed.
He's going to have a pet to take to that fair.
In that case I'd like to ask you one question.
- What?
- Not what.
Who.
Who?
Me.
That's who.
Grandpa, I have to admit it.
You're the greatest.
Father, I am deeply touched.
It's not every grandfather that would do what you did for Eddie.
Shh.
Here he comes now.
Oh.
Here you go, son.
Now, handle it very carefully.
Igor isn't as young as he used to be.
Good luck, Eddie.
And bring home a blue ribbon.
I bet I win first prize for the most intelligent pet.
Well, I wouldn't count on that too much.
Igor isn't as intelligent as he used to be either.
You better hurry now, dear.
Say, where's Grandpa?
He's, uh, uh, hung up in an experiment.
Uh, but he'll be with you in spirit all the time.
Now you be a good boy.
Okay.
Come on, Igor.
Good-bye, everybody.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Good luck.
Good luck, both of you.
You know, there's only one bad feature about this.
If Grandpa does win over that bunch of goldfish and hamsters, there'll be no living with him.
Children, you've all brought such interesting pets.
I'm sure your principal's going to have trouble in choosing a winner.
Aren't you, Mr. Hazlett?
Yes, indeed, Miss Guthrie.
Oh, what lovely doves.
Johnny, that's just lovely.
Look at that squirrel.
Isn't he a cute little fellow?
Well, and what is it we have here?
- It's me, Mr. Hazlett.
- No, Eddie.
I mean in the cage.
Oh.
It's my pet, Igor.
Oh.
Why, it's a bat.
Boy, what a neat pet.
Hey, Eddie, does it catch rats?
Only when it feels like dancing.
That's very nice, Eddie.
Uh, suppose you put the cover back on the cage now.
But, gee, Mrs. Guthrie, Igor hasn't done any of his tricks.
Well, what kind of tricks can he do?
My pet, Igor, will fly out of his cage, circle the room twice and return back to his cage on command.
Go, Igor.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, I bet Eddie is proud of his pet.
And I'm sure Grandpa is doing things that Igor wouldn't have the intelligence to think of.
I must say, I have to take my hat off to Grandpa for changing himself into a bat for Eddie's sake.
I know I wouldn't like to go out in public looking grotesque.
But we don't want Grandpa giving Eddie a false sense of values by catering to his every whim.
Well, Eddie doesn't know it's Grandpa.
He thinks it's Igor.
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Hello, Eddie.
Hi, son.
Well, how did you do at the pet fair?
How would you like to look at the prizewinner for the most intelligent pet at Mockingbird Heights School?
Look.
Father, what have you done now?
Where's Igor?
Igor?
Oh, I traded him off to Timmy Brubaker for the squirrel.
Isn't he neat?
Oh!
Oh!
Eddie, you naughty, naughty boy.
You traded your grandfather for a squirrel?
There, there, Aunt Lily.
Now don't you worry.
I'm real sorry, Mom, but I didn't know it was Grandpa.
Anyway, we only traded for the weekend.
I'm sure he'll be all right, Lily.
Sure.
He'll be home in no time.
Boy, you should have seen him flying after Miss Guthrie.
Vroom!
Or he'll just change himself back into his old self and walk home.
He can't change back to himself in that small cage.
There's no room.
Oh, Herman, what are we gonna do?
I didn't live all these years to to end up as the daughter of a squirrel.
I hope those Brubakers don't feed him peanuts and popcorn.
They always give Grandpa heartburn.
No cause for concern.
Eddie.
Yeah, Dad?
Why don't you go call your little friend, tell him the deal is off and that he can have his squirrel back for your bat.
Okay, Dad.
Herman, don't you think you better call the Brubakers?
No, dear.
It'll teach Eddie self-reliance and how to handle little problems like this when they come up later on in life with his own family.
Poor Grandpa.
He was only trying to do the right thing.
Come on.
Hello?
Mrs. Brubaker?
Is Timmy there?
Oh, well, this is Eddie Munster.
You probably don't remember me.
Oh, you do remember me.
Gosh.
I was only over at your house once.
Well, I'm calling about the bat I traded to Timmy today.
- You see, I have to get it back.
It's my grandfather.
- Eddie.
Don't tell them that.
They might jack up the price.
I mean, it's a a favorite of my grandmother's.
Oh, it's not there.
Golly.
They sold him.
- Sold him?
- Yeah.
Timmy sold him to his father for 65 cents.
And Mr. Brubaker took him down to where he works.
Where?
Where?
Ask her where he works.
Where does Mr. Brubaker work?
Oh, that's nice.
He likes laboratories.
Oh, where is this laboratory?
Thanks a lot, Mrs. Brubaker.
Don't worry.
There's nothing that can hurt Grandpa.
Mr. Brubaker's a rocket expert and works at a top secret space lab.
Oh.
Well, that's simple.
We'll just go down to the lab and pick him up.
Where is the lab, Eddie?
Washington, D.C.  Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Doctor.
Yes, Bruba Here's a new customer for our travel agency.
L Just in time too, Brubaker.
Yes.
I brought him in on the plane with me this morning.
And guess what.
What?
I bought him from my son for 65 cents.
Sixty  Let's put him over here, Brubaker.
Yes.
He certainly is a woolly one, isn't he?
Yes.
I've always wanted to send a bat into orbit.
Ah.
Listen to that.
It's almost as if he understood us.
He's so eager to go.
We've known for some time that bats, uh, possess some sort of radar.
Now we want to find out if their signals can be picked up by our own equipment.
Ah.
We're going to send this little fellow into orbit, and then we'll track him with our equipment.
Right.
You know what?
I think we'll send him up on that Thermal 2 that's, uh, scheduled to be blasted off tomorrow morning.
Oh, but, Dr. Grant, we haven't yet succeeded in recovering a Thermal 2.
Oh, I know.
But the, uh, success of the experiment doesn't depend on that particular bat.
We can always get another one, you know.
Poor bat.
This is peculiar, Doctor.
What's that?
Have you ever known a bat to faint?
ByJove, it is peculiar, isn't it?
Herman, don't press your nose against the glass.
You'll get your face all out of shape.
I'm sorry, Lily.
It's just that it's my first plane trip, and I'm so excited.
I'm worried about Grandpa.
Now, Lily, we'll be in Washington in less than an hour.
Just settle back and enjoy the trip the way I am.
Herman, what are you doing?
Lily, Marilyn, Eddie everybody out.
The propellers!
The propellers are gone!
Take it easy, Pop.
This is a jet plane.
Oh.
Of course.
You know, there is something strange, Lily.
Before we took off, this airplane was filled with people.
As soon as we came on and sat down, they all got up and left.
Well, l I guess maybe they just came to see somebody off.
I wonder where the stewardess is.
She hasn't come near us since we took off.
I think she's probably new on the job and a little nervous about flying.
Remember back at the airport those two men had to shove her on and slam the door behind her?
Hey, Pop.
Here comes the girl with the food.
She's gotten over her nervousness.
Miss, uh, uh, you're trembling.
Uh, if it's the fact that there are no propellers, uh, you needn't worry.
It's a jet.
Thank you.
Slow down, Eddie.
Don't bolt your food.
Okay.
Herman, she didn't bring us any salt.
Oh.
I'll call her.
Uh, miss?
Uh, stewardess, would you bring the salt, please?
Here you are, sir.
Hmm.
You know, Lily, I don't think that young lady has the stuff to make a good stewardess.
Has that bat come to yet?
Hmm?
Has that bat come to yet?
Oh.
No.
But I put something in the cage next to him that should bring him around a female bat.
Oh.
I thought they might as well get used to one another.
I mean, after all, tomorrow they blast off together.
Oh, that's such a good idea.
Let's leave them alone.
Okay.
Hey, buddy, you been here long?
Got here Tuesday.
You're new, aren't you?
Yeah, just pulled in today.
What goes on in there anyway?
From what I hear, you just wouldn't believe the weird things they build in there.
All kinds of kooky things they send into outer space.
What do they look like?
Look like?
You don't think they'd actually let us see 'em, do ya?
No, and I'm not sure I want to anyway.
Well, here we are.
It's a shame we had to spend all that money on a rented car.
It was impossible to get a taxi at the airport.
I think the taxis are on strike.
When I hailed them, some of the drivers abandoned their cabs right in the middle of the street.
Well, this is the space lab, Pop.
But that signs says keep out.
And look at those guards.
So fierce-looking.
My gosh!
So that's what they're building in there.
Yeah.
One of them must have got out.
They must have built it to send to outer space.
Send out?
It looks more like something they brought back.
Uh, pardon me.
You'd better get right back in there, mister.
Uh, m-master.
Uh, sir.
They'll be looking for you.
Inside?
In the laboratory?
Right this way, please.
We're We're your friends, you know.
Thank you.
Uh, you dogfaces are very polite.
See?
See?
I told you.
Your uncle can charm the vultures out of the trees when he wants to.
Are you sure we'll be able to accomplish the experiment tomorrow?
Yes.
Excuse me.
Yes, please.
Uh, gentlemen Oh, dear.
I do believe that you have a Uh, gentlemen?
Oh, my.
Oh!
No.
That's odd.
Well, genius.
Oh.
There you are, Grandpa.
Come along.
You've been very, very, very, very naughty.
Say, Brubaker.
Not a scratch.
That thing certainly gave me a fright walking in here like that.
Yes, but then I realize that must be what Dr. Schweinhart and his associates have been working on in such secrecy.
He always gets the most interesting projects.
Yes.
Oh, well.
We have our own work to do.
Right.
Back to our bats.
Yes.
I say, Brubaker, one of them's missing.
That thing of Schweinhart's must have taken it.
But why?
Because Schweinhart must have programmed him to do it.
That's his quaint idea of humor, you know.
Hmph.
Very unprofessional.
Yes.
However, I only need this one for the moment.
Mmm.
I want to test his reflexes.
I say, Brubaker, what's he doing?
I'm not sure.
But if he were a human being, I'd say that he was having a tantrum.
Uh-uh-uh.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Temper.
Temper.
Easy, boy.
Easy, easy, easy, easy.
That's it.
Yeah.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Easy.
I want to show you something, Brubaker.
This over here will do fine.
You know, I'm really going to miss him.
Oh.
I want you to watch how his radar works now.
I'm going to head him towards the wall.
He'll fly to within inches of it, then wheel off gracefully and avoid it.
Are you ready?
Of course.
Here we go.
Well, Brubaker, it looks like we got stuck with the stupid one.
Quick, Brubaker!
Grab him!
Say, are you lookin' for a bat?
Yes.
Uh Oh.
He went that way.
That way.
Modern science.
Uh, I say there, Corporal.
Yes, sir!
Uh, would you mind calling a cab for me for the airport?
I'm taking a plane home.
I'd fly there myself, but I've had a very trying day.
Yes, sir!
Who's the V.I.P.?
I don't know, but he wants a cab.
Get a load of the outfit on him.
Yeah, but you know how the air force is.
It must be their new dress uniform.
Will you come out of there, Grandpa, and change back into yourself?
He's probably sulking because the airline made him ride back in the baggage compartment.
Please, Grandpa, I'll never trade you for a rotten, old squirrel again.
Maybe we should give him a piece of cheese.
Maybe we oughta give her a piece of cheese.
It's not a her.
It's a him.
Will you keep out of it?
We know what we're doing.
Grandpa.
How can you be there when you're here?
Well, I just flew in from Washington.
Herman, you grabbed the wrong bat out of the laboratory.
That's Cleo, a female bat who they were gonna send up into orbit with me.
Gee, Grandpa.
It's nice to have you back.
Oh, Grandpa, we're glad you're home.
You're telling me.
You know, I'm as patriotic as the next fellow, but I'm not anxious to be the first bat on the moon.
Look!
Igor's back.
Well, look how that old rascal's going for Cleo.
Isn't it romantic?
I always thought that bat was part wolf.
Grandpa, what are they talking about?
Well  Excuse me, Eddie.
Herman, I think it's about time you had a little father-and-son talk with Eddie here.
You know, about the, uh, bats and the bees.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Lily, don't you think Marilyn should be up in bed?
I mean, she looks terrible with all that color in her cheeks and everything.
She was sent home from school about an hour ago.
Oh!
She has a fever 98.6.
But But isn't that normal, Aunt Lily?
Oh, heavens, no.
Uh, we Munsters average in the low 50s.
Hey, Dad.
Grandpa's down in the dungeon waiting to mix up a cure.
Here.
Grandpa, now hear this.
I read you, Herman.
High fever.
High fever.
And I feel so low.
Feels very low.
Feels very low.
Feels very low.
Feels very low.
There.
That oughta lift her spirits.
Oh.
Tell him to forget it.
Tell him to forget it.
Grandpa, forget it.
Oh.
Oh, I guess you're right about Grandpa's cures.
He should either give up medicine or take up practice in California.
Oh, you poor dear.
We'd better put her upstairs in bed before Grandpa has her floating all over the neighborhood.
Can I help you, Lily?
Oh, no, thank you, dear.
Oh, yes.
Uh Uh, maybe.
Uh, Marilyn was going to the bank for me.
Do you think I could trust you to make a withdrawal?
Trust me?
How could a levelheaded, conscientious fellow like me get in trouble at the bank?
Oh, Herman, here's the bankbook.
It's just a simple withdrawal.
Yes, dear.
Uh, but I think you'd better take Grandpa to the bank with you.
Hmm.
Well, I would prefer to make a withdrawal at the blood bank, but I guess you can't have everything.
Now, Herman, Yes, dear.
The withdrawal slip is all made out.
Mm-hmm.
We have a tax installment due Right.
So we need all the money from the tax account.
Right.
Uh, draw out all the money.
Yes.
Uh, my hat, please.
Thank you.
And, Herman Yes, dear?
Bring it straight back here.
Gotcha.
Grandpa.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Grover?
Yes, Williams.
I just had another report on those masked bandits who've been terrorizing this side of town.
They held up our main office this morning.
We may be next.
They the ones with the Halloween masks?
Yes, those hideous disguises are their trademark.
I'll warn all my tellers, sir.
Okay, but these men are always heavily armed, and I don't want anybody hurt.
You know my rule here.
If this bank is held up, you tell our people to turn over the money.
That's much better than having one of our personnel or our customers shot.
Okay, Mr. Grover.
I'll inform the tellers.
Excuse me, miss.
Yes, sir?
May I help  I'd like all the money.
Uh, miss, would you put it in a bag or something?
It It's hard to carry loose like that.
Oh, thank you, miss.
Uh, you give very quick service.
It's a pleasure doing business with you.
Bye.
You know, Herman, I didn't realize Lily had that much money in her tax account.
I know.
As the hipsters say, that's quite a bagful of bread.
Maybe you oughta count it while we're waiting for Lily.
Count it?
Good idea.
Good idea.
They might have robbed us.
$18,300.
Herman, I have some news for you.
Yes, dear?
We only had $680 in our tax account.
Really?
Really.
You know what this means, now, don't you?
Yes, I do, dear.
It means our bank gives a very generous rate of interest.
It means, Herman, that you have goofed it again.
But, Lily, "goofed it"?
What do you mean I goofed it?
What happened?
Oh!
Don't you "But, Lily" me.
All right.
I'll tell you exactly what happened.
This afternoon, a certain party went to the bank with a bankbook showing $680 in the account, hmm?
Mm-hmm.
And a withdrawal slip made out for $680.
Mm-hmm.
Mmm.
Now, what did this certain party do?
Did he come home with $680?
No, he did not.
This featherbrained klutz came home with $18,300 that didn't belong to him.
That's what he did.
Now, what would you have to say to that?
I would say that was a remarkable coincidence.
Because, you know, the same thing happened to me.
Herman.
Hmm?
You are the featherbrained klutz to whom I was referring.
Oh.
Oh, l l I was?
I mean, you were?
I mean Oh.
Well, golly, Lily.
You don't have to put all the blame on me.
L I mean, your own father was along with me, you know.
And he's not half as big a uh, what what you said as I am.
And anyway, when the lady at the bank gave us all that money, I couldn't just start counting it right there, 'cause she might have thought I didn't trust her.
Then she might have gotten angry at me, started yelling and everything.
Well l-I'm sorry, dear.
I guess it wasn't all your fault.
I don't know how it happened, but I do know one thing.
You've just got to take that money back to the bank tomorrow.
I mean, it's it's only the fair, adult thing to do.
Isn't it, sweetheart?
I guess so.
Then you're not mad at me anymore?
How could I stay mad at you, pussycat?
What are you doing?
Uh, uh, I've never seen this much money before.
Can't I just play with it till I have to give it back?
Oh, Herman!
$18,300.
Money, money.
Money, money.
Money.
My good man, I'll take that black limousine and two of those red convertibles, please.
Thank you.
Money.
Please, girls, stop kissing me.
Stop.
Just because I gave you a few diamond necklaces, doesn't mean you own me.
Zsa Zsa, no.
You'll have to stand in line like the rest.
I'm rolling in money.
I'm swimming in money.
I'm drowning in money.
Drowning.
Drowning.
Drowning.
All right, drown.
Help!
Help!
I'm drowning.
You can't let me drown.
I'm a rich man.
Help!
Are you quite through, Mr. Rockefeller?
Oh, it's you, Lily.
I was dreaming.
I thought I was a rich man.
Well, you're not.
So will you please send Zsa Zsa home and let's get some sleep.
Zsa Zsa?
Lily, I know I won't be able to sleep till that money's back in the bank.
Oh, of course you will.
And you'll take it back in the morning as soon as the bank is open.
Now good night.
I'm just dead.
I know I won't be able to sleep till that money's back in the bank.
To heck with waiting for it to open.
I'll take it back tonight.
Don't touch me.
I'm gonna short-circuit the burglar alarm system.
Grandpa, uh, uh, are you all right?
Well, just a little lightheaded.
Now, Herman, I just short-circuited the main fuse.
Give me this.
Now, go ahead, open the door.
After you, Grandpa.
If I remember correctly, the vault is someplace over there.
Herman?
Herman, where are you?
I'm over here.
What are you doing?
Uh, I just thought I'd fill my fountain pen.
Fill your fountain pen.
Herman, will you come on.
I found the vault.
Would you help?
Butterfingers.
Here.
Hold this.
Look.
It's set for Oh.
Maybe it works like an alarm clock.
What do you mean?
Well, they Uh, uh, maybe they set it from the back.
Uh, uh, what time shall I set it for?
Ooh.
Look, it it's almost 3:00.
Set it for 3:00.
All right.
and 3:00.
After you, Grandpa.
Uh, Grandpa, I'll feel around for the light switch.
Good idea.
Ah.
Ah.
It's rather pleasant in here.
Reminds me a little of the catacombs I used to crawl around in when I was very little.
Well, Herman, uh, we might as well say good-bye to our short-lived prosperity.
Uh, good-bye, short-lived prosperity.
Well, that was easy enough.
Now all we have to do is go home and   Grandpa, did you hear a door slam?
Yes, I did hear a door slam.
Was it a back door?
No, it wasn't a back door.
Was it a side door?
No, it wasn't a side door.
What kind of door was it?
It was the only door.
Herman!
Herman!
Herman, we're locked in!
We're trapped, Herman!
We're hermetically sealed in here, Herman!
These walls are made of solid steel.
Herman, we may never get out of here!
Herman, don't you understand?
We may never get out of here.
Well, it'll teach us a darn good lesson to be more careful next time.
Why?
Marilyn.
Marilyn.
Oh, yes, Aunt Lily?
Oh, I hate to disturb you, dear, but have you seen your Uncle Herman?
He's gone.
Oh, well, maybe he's in with Grandpa.
No, I've already checked Grandpa's room.
His slab hasn't even been slept on.
Do you suppose they might have gone on one of their strolls through the cemetery?
They just might have.
Herman was so worried about that money that he was having trouble getting to sleep.
I'm afraid I wasn't very sympathetic.
Oh, I'm sure that's where they are, Aunt Lily.
And you know if there's one thing those two really dig, it's graveyards.
Grandpa, we've just gotta find a way to get out of here.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Oh.
Grandpa, we've gotta find a way to get out of here.
You're right.
Now, we've just got to keep looking.
And that way we might just be able to Herman, look.
"For emergency use only.
'" Grandpa, look.
A telephone.
I'll just call the police department, tell them we're locked in, they'll come get us and we'll be out in no time.
Operator, get me the police department.
Which precinct, please?
Precinct?
Uh, Mockingbird Heights Precinct.
That's a local number.
You may dial it direct, sir.
Yes, but you see, I don't have the number.
Local numbers are listed in your directory.
But, miss, there is no directory here.
You see, I'm locked in a v I'll connect you with Information.
She's getting me Information.
Herman, Information?
Wha Information, could I have the number of the Mockingbird Heights Police Department, please?
That number is 177-9771.
Thank you, miss.
Right.
Write that down, Grandpa.
I will.
I don't seem to have anything to write it with.
Herman, give me your pen.
It's empty.
You wouldn't let me fill it.
Ooh!
Fill it We'll just have to remember it.
Here.
Right.
They'll want to know where we are.
What's the address of this bank?
I think it's 40691 st Street.
I'll just keep that in my head.
You got it?
I got it.
40691 st Street.
And the telephone number is 177-9771.
Right.
And, Herman, when you get the police, they'll be here in five or 10 minutes.
If they go like 60, we'll have seven or eight of them down here in 20 winks.
And it'll be one, two, button my shoe, three, four, and they'll open the door!
Oh!
Herman.
Herman, what are you waiting for?
Dial the number.
You made me forget it.
"Forget it".
Oh, this is ridiculous.
Herman, give me that thing.
"One, two, buckle my shoe".
Listen, lady, this is an emergency.
My friend and I are here, and we're locked in a bank vault together, and the walls are two feet thick, and we're we're running out of air.
If you don't get somebody down here immediately, we'll both be dead.
Listen, lady.
Please, do something.
I'd love to help you, sir, but this is a recording.
It's a recording.
Grandpa, what did you push?
The light went on.
"Push to summon police".
Maybe we'll be rescued after all.
Oh, Herman, before we know it, there'll be someone on the other side of the door trying to get in.
You know, Fingers, we're really throwing the cops off in hitting this place at night instead of in the daytime.
Sure, Scotty, and I always felt like a goon wearing that Halloween mask.
I thought it was really becoming to you.
There's the vault.
Come on.
Hey.
Hey.
What a What a break.
What a break.
Someone, uh, disconnecting the the burglar alarm.
And that front door's the easiest lock I ever picked.
Yeah.
This bank is sure askin' for it.
Listen, we gotta blow this vault, get the loot and scram out of here.
Oh, yeah.
Come on.
Come on.
Start your drill.
I'll hold the flashlight.
Come on.
Let's get goin'.
All right.
Let her rip.
Grandpa, listen.
Somebody's working on the door.
It sounds like a big drill.
We're being rescued.
A drill?
Who wants to be rescued by a dentist?
Okay, Scotty, there she is.
Are you sure this job's gonna be worth it?
Fingers, when we blow this door off, you just ain't gonna believe what's inside.
Light it.
Grandpa, it got quiet out there.
You don't suppose they've given up?
Don't be ridiculous, Herman.
They must have stopped to have a cigarette or something.
I'm sure we'll be hearing a noise any minute now.
Hi!
Herman, these are the ones who did it.
Oh, Grandpa, I feel so good, I'm gonna give 'em a big hug.
I think we better get out of here before somebody shows up.
They don't look like police to me.
Read some more about the bank robbers, Grandpa.
Well, "Scotty Malone and Fingers Dusick "upon being revived by police at the scene of the attempted robbery "blamed their capture on two unidentified citizens who appeared from nowhere and rendered them unconscious".
Oh, how brave of you, Herman.
"Now, these are thought to be the same persons who summoned the police on the bank's alarm system".
And it says a reward is waiting if the two men come forward.
Are you gonna claim it, Herman?
Oh, I don't really think so, Lily.
It would mean interviews and photographs, and you know how shy I am about having my picture taken.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thanks for the lift, Charlie.
Pick me up around 9:00 tomorrow morning.
Lily, pussycat is home.
Good evening, dear.
Good evening, dear.
I see the carpool dropped you off again.
Yes, and it was quite restful riding in the back.
Oh!
Mail, dear?
No, but it's something I'm very upset about.
I was putting up some new cobwebs in Marilyn's room, and I, um, accidentally found this hidden in her bureau drawer.
Oh, a love letter.
Let's read it.
Herman, it's not a love letter.
It's an announcement of a parents' night at Marilyn's school.
It's next Saturday night and she hasn't even asked us yet.
I have a feeling she doesn't want us to be seen at her school for some strange reason.
And I think we ought to get to the bottom of this at supper.
Well, it may not be that serious, Lily.
L-It may just have slipped her mind.
Things are always popping out of my head.
Yes, but with you, we can always put them back in.
Now remember, Herman, we have to find out why Marilyn hasn't mentioned parents' night at school.
But we have to be very subtle about it.
Be very subtle.
I see.
How do we do that?
Well, we lead up to it gradually.
First I'll bring up the subject of cars.
Cars.
That'll lead to driving.
Driving.
And then I'll bring up the subject of driving to school.
Driving to school.
Of course.
And that'll lead up to  Parents' night.
Gotcha.
Oh, my!
Everything looks so delicious, Lily.
Oh, thank you, Grandpa.
Uh, Marilyn, how do you feel about the new cars?
New cars?
Well, I think that And how come you didn't ask us to parents' night at school?
Parents'night?
Well, where did you hear about that?
Well Well, dear, I was dusting your room, and I just happened to come across the invitation.
It's, uh, next Saturday night, isn't it?
Yes, Marilyn.
Don't try to hide anything.
You know, in this family nothing ever stays buried.
The reason I didn't mention it was because Well, because of you, Uncle Herman.
Me?
Well, why wouldn't you want me, of all people, to go to parents' night?
Well, I just didn't think you'd care for it.
It's going to be sort of a dinner dance.
Oh.
Dancing.
Why didn't you say so?
Dancing has never been one of my strong points.
I guess you could say I have two left feet.
Well, that's what happens when they put someone together in the dark.
Herman, I think we should go.
I mean, at your age, it's high time you took up dancing.
Lily, you know I hate dancing.
I've always hated to dance.
I'm not going through with it.
I am not going down there at the risk of making a fool out of myself.
I am not going dancing!
And one, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One Herman.
Herman, relax.
You're so stiff.
Yeah, Herman, let everything go.
Well, I'll-I'll try, but the last time I let everything go, some of it didn't come back.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two One, two, three.
I think I'm getting the knack of it.
Timber!
Herman  You know something, Lily, I just got a new respect for Lawrence Welk.
Marilyn, Eddie!
What happened?
Come and help your Uncle Herman.
Careful.
Listen, Lily.
They're playing our song.
Ah!
If that Herman wants to dance, I'll mix him something that'll make him dance.
Ho, ho!
Now, let me see.
Ah, yes, now I know.
A little potassium.
?
?
A pinch of chlorophyll.
Two fingers of Geritol.
A dash of bitters.
And now for the secret ingredient!
A pair of Fred Astaire's dancing shoes.
Go, Fred, go.
Grandpa?
Grandpa, are you making lasagna again?
You're smelling up the whole house.
No, as a matter of fact, I'm whipping up a batch of my secret dancing potion.
This will make you a wonderful dancer.
No, sir.
I'm not drinking anything you mix up.
Okay.
Go to the parents' night dance.
Disgrace poor Marilyn.
Make a fool of yourself.
I'm not gonna disgrace anybody.
Listen to this.
I found an ad in the newspaper, and they're gonna make me an accomplished ballroom dancer in three easy lessons.
Listen: "Happyland Ballroom.
"Fox-trot, tango, samba, watusi.
All the latest steps.
"Gain poise, popularity.
Make friends.
Free trial lesson.
Private and group rates.
'" Herman, listen to me.
There are plenty of good dancing schools, but you gotta watch out for the shysters.
Shysters?
Uh, but look what it says "Let us bring out the inner you at our low monthly rates".
And it's signed, "Happy Havemeyer, Doctor ofTerpsichore".
Okay.
If that's what you want to do.
That's exactly what I want to do.
I'm going to go down there and sign up first thing in the morning.
Hm.
Hm!
All right, fine.
Yes, that'll be okay.
Bye-bye.
Miss Valentine, if you would.
Miss Valentine, since you're a new instructor here at Happyland, I'd like to acquaint you with our policy.
Most of our clients are older people, misfits, widowers, people searching for friendship.
Some are rather bewildered, and they come to us looking for guidance.
We have a definite approach to these folks.
- What's that, Doctor?
- We take 'em for all they've got.
Uncle Herman left early, didn't he?
Yes, the sweet thing went downtown to take dancing lessons.
He's so anxious to make a good impression at the parents' night dance.
I'm surprised that he never learned to dance when he was younger.
Well, when other young men were going to parties and dances, I'm afraid he was always tied up in the laboratory.
You know, they have women teachers down at those dancing schools.
I just hope one of them doesn't fall in love with your Uncle Herman's gentle charms.
Doctor Havemeyer.
!
Doctor Havemeyer.
!
Calm down, Miss Valentine.
What happened?
Well, l-I know you said there'd be a lot of weirdos and misfits around here, but you should've seen what just walked in and wanted to take dancing lessons.
You gotta see him!
Now, now.
There's no need for me to see him.
Didn't I tell you to expect all kinds?
Now, you get back in there, turn on the charm.
Flatter him.
Tell him how great a dancer he is.
And then when you got him hooked, get him to sign our 10-year contract.
Well, I'll try.
It's times like this I wish I'd stayed with the Roller Derby.
Oh, there you are, miss.
Was there some emergency?
You left here so fast, I thought the place was on fire.
No such luck.
Well, shall we start?
Alrighty.
?
?
Uh, excuse me.
Yeah, that's better.
Now, the first thing you have to do is put your arm around me.
Oh, uh I saw Robert Montgomery do that once.
Ready?
Ready.
And one And one and two and one and two.
And three and four.
Now one and two and three and four and one and two and three and four.
Tell me, Mr. Munster, have you ever danced professionally?
Professionally?
Heavens no!
I would have never known.
Really?
Yoo-hoo, Lily.
I'm home.
Oh, welcome home, dear.
Well, how did my sweetheart make out at dancing class?
How did I make out?
I made out just beautifully, Lily.
Miss Valentine said after just one lesson, I was a natural born dancer.
She's never seen such a talent.
Oh, that's wonderful!
I just know that when I dance with you at the ball, every eye in the room will be on us.
And, Lily, Miss Valentine said that Dr. Havemeyer might even make me a teacher after a few more lessons.
A teacher!
And, Lily, I was reading today in a fan magazine You know, that's the way Gene Kelly started out as a dancing teacher.
Then he starred in Pal Joey, then he was a big smash in For Me and My Gal, and then there was Gene's biggest hit, Singing in the Rain.
?
I'm singing in the rain just singing in the rain?
?
What a glorious feeling I'm happy again?
?
I'm laughing at clouds?
?
So dark up above?
?
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love?
?
Marilyn, Grandpa.
Come on.
Oh, boy.
He's got his head in the harp again.
What a crack-up.
!
Please, watch the face.
I'm gonna be a star.
?
?
?
?
Mr. Munster!
Mr. Munster!
What is it?
The music has stopped.
Don't bring me back now.
I'm too far out!
Oh, Mr. Mun Man, it's wig city!
Please, Mr. Munster.
Please.
Your lesson is over for this evening.
However, Dr. Havemeyer would like you to sign up for a special course.
It's inexpensive and the lessons extend over a 10-year period.
Really?
Am I that good?
Oh, yes.
You're marvelous!
Wheeee!
Sit down right here, and I'll get you the papers to sign.
Catch your breath.
They're, um They're all stapled together, so you don't have to bother to read the fine print.
Thank you.
That's very thoughtful of you.
Hey, Mom, can I take Spot to school with me today?
Not today, Eddie.
Spot's being punished.
He got out last night and ate all the neighbor's trash cans.
Morning, all.
Hi.
Morning, Lily.
Good morning, dear.
Morning, Herman.
Uh, how's Gene Kelly this morning?
Couldn't be better.
The dancing school is signing me up to a 10-year contract.
Marilyn, you're gonna be very proud of your Uncle Herman at the dance Saturday night.
Your lunch pail's all packed, dear.
And here's your breakfast.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, there's the carpool.
I'd better run.
Wrong?
It's this contract that Herman signed with the dancing school.
He signed a 10-year contract for 1,500 lessons at 750 a lesson!
Why, that's Thank you, Eddie.
And that's only the beginning.
There's more?
More?
A life insurance policy naming the school as benefiiciary.
In case of default, a garnishee on Herman's salary.
A lien on his home.
An attachment on his automobile.
And in case of any legal action, a waiver of all his rights as an American citizen.
What are we going to do, Grandpa?
Well, we just can't let him know he's been taken.
Poor dear is so sensitive, he's liable to go right into his shell.
His shell?
What did you marry, a man or a lobster?
Oh, Grandpa.
We'll just have to think of some other way.
Oh, Lily.
Forget it.
Lily, I got it.
I got it.
I'll take care of it.
Now, the first thing I'll do, I'll turn that whole school into a swamp.
Then I'll turn the owner into a frog.
Then I'll turn all the other teachers into lizards.
I'll turn myself Into an alligator.
A hungry alligator.
Then I'll start eatin' my way Oh, stop it, Father.
This is no time to be thinking of your pleasures.
Aw, gee, Mom.
You never let Grandpa have any fun anymore.
Never you mind, Eddie.
We Munsters are law-abiding citizens, and we're going to call the police right now.
Well, you better hurry.
Herman's got another lesson tonight.
Right.
I gotcha.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Miss Valentine, I just got an inside tip that the cops are going to run an investigation on us.
Look, what they usually do is they get an investigator to pose as a student.
Some clod who acts like he can't get out of his own way.
And when he gets the evidence on us Wham!
Out come the handcuffs.
Yoo-hoo.
!
Uh, Miss Valentine?
Twinkletoes is here!
I'll be right there.
!
If you think that the Look, Dr. Havemeyer.
Speaking of clods who can't get out of their own way, I think the police are onto us already.
- What do you mean?
- You know that student we signed up to the 10-year contract yesterday?
I didn't think he was for real from the beginning.
Yeah?
I'd better have a look at him.
?
?
Wow.
That's the weirdest disguise I've ever seen.
The cops are really reaching this time.
He looks like a cross between Little Abner and Ramses II.
What do we do now, Doctor?
We take desperate measures.
We turn honest.
We tell him after analyzing his dancing, we find out that he has absolutely no talent, and we're refunding his money.
But, Dr. Havemeyer, M-M-Miss Valentine, y-you must be kidding me.
I'm afraid not, Mr. Munster.
You mean I won't be a dancing teacher?
No.
Upon analysis, we find your dancing to be crude and awkward.
And your coordination is atrocious.
You have absolutely no sense of rhythm.
But I wanna be a teacher, and maybe get to Broadway, and then get to Hollywood, and become a big dancing star like Gene Kelly.
And get to meet people like Kirk Douglas and Nick Adams and all those big shots.
I'm sorry.
It is our decision to return your money, tear up your contract and discontinue your lessons.
But you can't do that.
I mean, I promised to go to parents' night with my niece and do the fox-trot and the bunny hop.
Well, now I'll just look silly and stupid.
I don't wanna look stupid and silly.
I don't want to.
I don't want to.
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
I don't want to!
I don't want to.
!
I don't want to.
!
What do you think, Doctor?
I think it's the greatest performance by a policeman since Pat O'Brien.
I told my date that we'd meet him at the dance.
Well, that's a good idea, Marilyn.
The last time a young man came to our house to pick you up, he had some sort of an attack right on our front porch.
Oh, I wonder if Uncle Herman has the car out yet.
Why, Herman, you're not even dressed yet.
Yes, Uncle Herman.
And we're due there now.
I'm sorry, girls.
I'm not going.
Not going?
But we've been looking forward to this all week, and you took all those dancing lessons.
And you brought that tuxedo home from the parlor and everything.
Well, Herman has something to tell you about the dancing school.
Well, the truth is that last night, they tore up my 10-year contract, gave me back the money and told me to get lost.
Oh, well, that was just a phony school.
W-Well, that doesn't matter.
W-What does matter is they showed me that I must face the truth about myself.
And I realize that when you add it up on the scoreboard of life, Herman Munster is just a big, awkward clod.
Oh, darling, you are not at all.
Well, uh, be that as it may, l-I want you to go to the dance, Lily, and you, Marilyn, and enjoy yourselves amidst the lights and the music and the gaiety.
But, pussycat No, no.
No, no.
Lily, I want you to go.
L-I insist.
And, uh, if, during the evening, some attractive gentlemen comes up to you and asks you to dance, I want you to feel free to accept.
And, uh, while you're dancing, and he's holding you tight, I don't want you to give one moment's thought to your faithful husband sitting here alone with his shriveled-up old father-in-law.
Herman, you're all heart.
Oh, but, Uncle Herman No, no.
Go out the door and don't look back.
Well, all right, Herman, if you insist.
Come on, Marilyn.
You know, shrivel l-I mean, Grandpa it gives me a good feeling inside knowing I did the right thing.
What a cornball.
!
Grandpa, Herman.
Aunt Lily fell on the front porch.
What happened?
Is she all right?
Well, I think she sprained her ankle.
Oooh.
!
Oooh.
Oooh.
Just help me to the sofa, Herman.
I don't know how it happened.
Grandpa, wasn't that noble of Aunt Lily?
You mean about her not making a fuss about her ankle?
Oh, no.
Because she pretended that she sprained her ankle so she could stay home with Uncle Herman.
Oh, boy!
This family's come a long way from Transylvania when we used to pound stakes into each other.
Now, Eddie, watch this.
Just watch this.
Herman, what are you and Eddie doing out here in all this bright sunlight?
Daddy's practicin' baseball.
That's right, Lily.
There's a father and son baseball game at Eddie's school, and I'm gonna be ready.
I'm not gonna make a fool of myself the way I did last week at Marilyn's dance.
Well, you be careful now, Herman.
Lily, please.
This is my game.
Just watch this.
Should I bring him in the house, Mom?
No, Eddie, just leave him there.
The carpool will be by in 10 minutes to pick him up.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Hi, Grandpa.
Where's Lily?
She's gone to bed.
You better go up and tell her where you've been.
You've been out three nights in a row.
What are you up to?
Grandpa, I don't want Lily to know, but I'm engaged in a project that is going to benefit mankind and keep the streets of our country safe for women and children everywhere.
No.
Yes.
I'm a detective.
What?
You, a detective?
Herman.
Herman, do me a favor.
Hmm?
When the boys from the happy hatch come to fit you with that canvas housecoat, please, don't tell 'em you're my son-in-law!
What time did Uncle Herman get home last night, Aunt Lily?
Not till 11:00.
He had some vague excuse about getting lost on the way home from work.
- Hey, maybe Pop is leadin' a double life.
- A double life?
Yeah.
He's really a criminal on parole, and he has to go out at night and pay blackmail to some crooks, so they won't tell everybody his mother runs a saloon in New Orleans.
Eddie Munster, wherever do you get such ideas?
It was on the second feature at the kiddies' matinee.
Oh, those horror shows!
Eddie, you should spend Saturday afternoons at home doing something more wholesome, like digging up bones in the backyard with Spot.
Where's Uncle Herman now, Aunt Lily?
He's down in that lab again with Grandpa.
I don't know what they're up to.
It's awfully quiet down there.
I'd feel a lot better if I could hear a few explosions.
"Follow that man.
"Learn to be a detective in your spare time.
"Earn up to $75 a week.
"Glamour, excitement Official badge with first lesson".
"United States National Federal Detective Academy.
Box 14, Tijuana, Mexico".
Oh, boy.
My son-in-law, the wetback detective.
Herman, this is a gyp outfit.
Oh, no, they're not.
That's where I have you, Grandpa.
They sent me this official detective kit.
See?
Here's my fingerprinting equipment.
-  -  And these are what is commonly known in the trade as restraining cuffs.
Well Oh, it doesn't matter anyway.
They didn't send me the key.
And, eh-eh, what is this, a Tijuana phone book?
No.
This is my 20 easy lessons.
See?
Here's a chapter on how to follow men.
Eh?
Here's a chapter on how to follow women.
Here's a chapter on how to follow men disguised as women.
You see, Grandpa?
I am too a detective.
Okay.
Okay.
Good.
Good.
You're a detective.
What do you do now?
What do I do now?
I give up my present low-salary job for the high-paying rewards of a career in law enforcement.
You mean quit your job down at the parlor?
Herman, you're a big man down there.
You, who started out I'm not quitting right now, Grandpa.
I need more experience.
That's why I've been out the last three nights practicing how to shadow people.
Grandpa?
Grandpa Oh!
Herman, hmm?
Not only will you get Lily mad, but if you keep shadowing people, you will wind up with what is known in the trade as a belt in the mouth!
Grandpa, you can laugh if you want to, but I'm on the verge of a career in law enforcement.
I've already sent in my application to the Kempner Detective Agency right here in this town.
They said they'd call me.
Are you sure about that?
That's just what they said: "Don't call us, we'll call you".
Herman?
And just where do you think you're going again tonight?
Uh Eh, just out, dear.
There's some secret work I have to do that will eventually be of great benefit to my family.
All right, go ahead.
I don't suppose it matters to you that you're completely ruining my plans for the evening.
Oh?
What plans are those, dear?
Oh, just that I'm supposed to go out tonight and collect for our favorite charity, Bundles for Transylvania.
I thought that my husband could at least be with me when I knock on strange doors.
But that's all right.
Go ahead, stay out all evening with your "secret" work.
- But, Lily!
- Oh, no.
Go on.
And while you're out, why don't you send a one-word telegram to our poor friends in the Old Country "Starve"!
But   Oh, it's only you.
Well, w-why don't you sit closer?
What for?
So I can give you a kiss.
Oh, l-I'd be embarrassed.
Well, then close your eyes.
Will you close yours?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
One, two, three.
Oh, um, me no Peeping Tom.
Me number-one detective.
Oh!
Well, he's not at the office.
Secret work, my foot.
I'll just bet he's seeing another woman.
Oh, Aunt Lily.
I'm going down first thing in the morning to the Kempner Detective Agency and have your Uncle Herman followed!
Well, what do you suppose he's been doing, Aunt Lily?
Well, I don't know.
But the next time he does it, there'll be a detective behind him taking notes!
Well, I'm sure we can handle this case, Mrs. Munster.
Would you give us a description of your husband?
Well, he's average height, about 7 foot 3.
Seven foot 3?
Did he ever play basketball?
No.
J- Just in the backyard with our son, Eddie.
But he had to give it up.
He kept catching his head in the hoop.
- How about his weight?
- Three spins.
Three spins?
Yes.
When he gets on the bathroom scale you know the little dial well, it spins around three times.
Put down "heavy".
How does he wear his hair?
Well, um, he wears it a little long on the sides and, uh, flat on top.
- Ears?
- Mm-hmm, two.
Oh, they're not a matched set, but only the family can tell.
Herman has a very distinguished lantern jaw and piercing eyes.
And, um, a classic nose.
Oh, and an overhanging forehead.
Overhanging forehead?
Yes.
It keeps the water out of his eyes when he's in the shower.
Any, uh, scars or birthmarks?
No.
Oh.
He does have a cute little dimple right here.
- Dimple?
- It's about five inches long, and this wide and all "jaggedy".
Do you suppose you could have him followed and find out what he's up to?
Well, uh, I tell you, Mrs. Munster, we're pretty busy right now.
We got a lot of husbands to follow.
It always happens when the warm weather sets in.
Uh, suppose I talk this over with my partner, and we'll get right back to you.
Well, l-I certainly hope you don't find out it's another woman.
I'd hate to lose Herman.
He's one in a million.
One in a million?
From the description, I'd say the odds are a lot higher than that.
Mike, I'd hate to put one of our men on this case.
The whole thing sounds so weird.
There's no telling what might happen.
Yeah, but  Kempner Detective Agency.
This is 702 speaking.
I mailed an application and called you several times last week.
It's that crank who calls himself 702 calling back.
You know, that boob who wants to be a detective?
Shall I tell him to get lost again?
Wait a minute.
We got nothing to lose.
Why don't we put him on this case, have him follow this Munster character?
If he gets his head bashed in, at least the union won't be on our necks.
Uh, look, uh, 702, we got a case for you.
Ajealous woman wants her husband followed.
We'll send you the details.
You take it from there.
Oh, golly.
Oh, gee.
But don't send it to my house.
Uh, send it to my place of business.
Oh, and use my code name.
I don't want anyone to know what I'm up to.
Good-bye.
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
I'm a detective!
I'm a detective!
Now, Grandpa, the agency sent me this description of the man I'm supposed to follow.
Evidently he goes out late at night without any explanation, and his wife is suspicious.
This man is a philanderer.
Herman, this man is a bum!
That's what he is!
Be that as it may.
According to lesson 12 of the correspondence course, the first thing to do is make a composite drawing of the suspect.
I suppose you could do that.
Fine.
Now, you read the description while I make the drawing, like the shrewd, well-trained detective I am.
Good.
What's the matter?
Somebody stole my crayon!
Will you calm down?
Here.
Here's a pencil.
Oh, thank you, Grandpa.
What's the matter now?
There's no point on it.
Give me that.
Thank you.
Now, you read the description of the man I'm supposed to follow while I make the sketch.
Good.
Now, "Height: 7 foot 3".
My, he's a big one.
"Weight: Heavyset.
"Hair: Long on the sides, very flat on top".
Long on sides, flat on top.
What are you looking at?
Nothing.
"Ears: Do not match".
"Ears do not match".
What are you looking at now?
Nothing.
"Lantern jaw".
"Lantern jaw".
"Piercing eyes".
"Piercing eyes".
"Classic nose".
"Classic nose".
Lantern jaw, piercing eyes, classic nose.
Ist das nicht ein classic nose?
Ja, das ist ein classic nose.
Flat on top, lantern jaw, long on sides, piercing eyes, classic nose.
Oh, du schöne, oh, du schöne, oh, du schöne classic nose.
Herman, will you knock it off?
I'm sorry, Grandpa.
I guess I just got carried away.
After all, I was made in Germany.
"Protruding brows".
"Protruding brows".
What are you looking at now?
Nothing.
"Jagged dimple on forehead".
"Jagged dimple on forehead".
Gotcha.
Well, Grandpa?
Here's what the poor boob looks like.
What's the matter?
Herman, I've got news for you.
This poor boob is you!
Me?
No.
No, i-i-it couldn't be me.
Grandpa, this man is a philanderer.
If I were chasing women, I'd be the first one to know it.
Wait a minute, Herman.
I've got the answer to the whole thing.
Look, it says here that the woman who wants this man followed is Mrs. Lily Munster.
But why would Lily want me followed?
Because you've been going out at night.
She hired the detective agency to find out what you've been up to.
Oh, I get it.
Then the man I'm supposed to follow is Herman Munster.
Right.
Herman, may I ask what you're doing?
Th-There must be a chapter on how to follow yourself.
Herman, look, you can't tell Lily you're a detective.
But I have a scheme.
Now, you go out tonight and stay out as late as usual.
Then, then as Agent 702, you file a very favorable report on Herman Munster.
The agency gives this report to Lily.
Lily is happy, you're happy, and the agency is happy!
Marilyn, I want you to sit over there on the sofa.
Grandpa, in your chair.
And Herman, I want you to sit right here so you'll be next to me.
Oh, why all the formality, Aunt Lily?
It almost seems like the reading of a will.
I'm afraid it's not that happy an occasion.
- Then, uh, what is it, Lily?
- I've brought you all together because a certain member of our family has indulged in many unexplained absences in the evenings.
Now, rather than accuse this person unjustly, I have had this woman chaser followed.
How do you like that, Grandpa?
My own wife, Lily, has had me followed.
I can't believe it.
Now, what kind of creatures are we turning into?
Anyway, I got this report from the detective agency this morning.
And I'm going to read it right now in front of all of you.
Go right ahead, Lily.
I'm ready for the worst.
"Report submitted by Agent 702 on Herman Munster.
"8:17, suspect left house.
"8:20, suspect patted stray dog on head.
"Proceeded to Maple Avenue.
Helped old lady across street.
"9:06, attended church.
"9:38, prevented man from beating horse.
Well, so far, it sounds like an evening with Pat Boone.
"10:03, followed suspect to Gaiety Burlesque Theater".
Oh, Uncle Herman!
"10:04, suspect crossed street to avoid Gaiety Burlesque Theater.
Rudy's Bar and Grill".
Aha!
"10:16, suspect showed picture "of wife and child to Rudy.
Refused free beer.
'" I always carry that picture.
"10:30, visited park.
Fed starving pigeons.
"Bought matches from little match girl.
"Attended church.
Came home.
"Found wife asleep.
"Kissed wife good night.
Went to bed.
'" Herman, I'm so sorry.
L-I never should have blamed you for doing anything wrong, pussycat.
L-I'll never mistrust you again in all my lives.
There, there, Lily.
Uh, I forgive you, dear.
Uh, but I always want you to remember this I want you to remember one thing.
In the great vegetable market of life, I have never been one to pinch the tomatoes.
- Herman!
-  You're not going out again tonight.
You want to get in trouble again?
No, Grandpa.
It's just that I did such a good job as Agent 702, the Kempner Agency called me up and gave me another case.
I'm gonna be a bodyguard.
There's some poor unfortunate woman whose husband has been threatening her.
And my orders are, if he comes around, not to get violent, just scare him away.
You?
How could you scare anybody?
It's nice of you to help me with my charity drive tonight, Marilyn.
With all these problems, I've been neglecting my house-to-house calls.
Well, Bundles for Transylvania is a worthy cause.
Why, back in the Old Country they should get down on all fours and thank you for what you've done.
Come on, dear.
Let's go.
I, um, l-I just wanted to thank you, Mr. Kempner, for sending over a bodyguard wearing such a frightening disguise.
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure he'll scare my husband away if he comes around.
Oh, and, um, I want to apologize for fainting when Agent 702 showed up.
Yes.
For a minute I thought he really looked like that.
Yes.
Well, thank you again, Mr. Kempner.
Good-bye.
You're sure I can't get you some coffee or something?
Oh, no, thank you.
I'm-I'm very comfy.
Don't worry.
I'll get it.
Good evening.
I'm collecting for Herman!
What are you doing here?
Oh, Lily.
W-Well, you see, l  If that's my husband, get rid ofhim.
Uncle Herman!
Eh Lily, you may not believe this, but I'm Secret Agent 702.
Herman, you may not believe this, but I'm Sonny Liston!
Come on, Marilyn.
And when the Kempner Detective Agency gave me the job of being bodyguard to Mrs. Andrews, I was on my way to fame and fortune as a detective.
Tsk.
But tonight when you knocked me out, they fired me.
There, there.
L-I'm sorry, dear.
I had no idea you were trying so hard to make good for Eddie and me.
Come on, Marilyn.
Let's go in the kitchen and fix sweetie a glass of warm milk.
Boy, Herman, you sure got yourself into a mess this time.
Don't worry, Grandpa.
I'll never try to be a detective again.
Good.
But you know something, Grandpa, I saw this ad in a magazine at Mrs. Andrews's house for something where I can't fail.
What ad?
See?
I'm gonna study hairdressing in my spare time and make a fortune with my own beauty parlor.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Ooh, my goodness!
There's your carpool.
You'd really better hurry.
Yes, dear.
Just like the Old Country.
Does my heart good to see a man wolf his food.
Well, good-bye, everybody.
Bye.
Good-bye, Lily.
Will you be home from the parlor early, dear?
Oh.
Well, today we're having our annual office party.
Oh.
Well, then be careful.
Uh, those office parties can get a little wild.
Oh, y-you don't have to worry about me, dear.
I'm no watercooler Casanova.
As a matter of fact, I'm so square, I understand some of the secretaries are starting to refer to me as ""Herman the Cube.
'' Well, come home as soon as you can.
Eh, I'll be home at least by 6:30.
Uh, good-bye, all.
Bye.
You think Munster's wife will let him stay for the office party tonight?
We told him it would be over by 6:30-- that way she'll let him go.
Yeah, but it won't really get going till 9:00.
Old Herman will be lucky if he gets home by midnight.
Shh.
Here he comes.
Hey, Mom, when's Dad coming home from work?
He wasn't here for supper or anything.
Well, you see, Eddie, there are times when the social requirements of his job, and the morale of his fellow employees, require your father's presence after closing time.
Hmm.
Another office party, huh?
Well, something like that.
Now, don't you think you'd better run along to bed?
Okay.
Have you done everything?
Have you put away your toys and brushed your fangs?
Mm-hmm.
All right.
That's fine, Eddie.
Good night.
Don't forget Woof-Woof.
Oh, of course.
Good night, Grandpa.
Hmm.
Good night, Eddie.
Good night, Woof-Woof.
Good night.
Hey, Mom, can Spot sleep in my room tonight?
All right, Eddie, but be careful.
He has a slight cold, and I don't want him to start sneezing and set fire to the drapes.
Good night.
Good night.
Come on, Spot!
You get to sleep with me tonight.
Good boy, Spot.
Ah, there's nothing more touching than a boy and his pet.
Correction.
The bum ain't home yet.
Smart aleck.
Oh, I had no idea it was so late.
Now I'm really angry with Herman.
I'm going to call him up again and tell him off.
?
Camptown ladies sing this song?
?
Doo-dah?
Hello?
This is Lily.
What do you mean, ""Lily who''?
This is your wife!
Oh, Lily!
I'm, uh, I'm glad you called, dear.
?
Oh, doo-dah day?
Do you know the lyrics to the second chorus of""Shortenin' Bread''?
?
Doo-dah, doo-dah ?
?
Doo-dah, doo-dah?
Herman Munster!
I have had enough of this!
You come right home this-- ?
Oh, doo-dah day?
Now what was that, Lily?
Come on back, Hermie baby.
!
Eh, coming, Miss Haversham.
- Oh, what was that, dear?
-  Lily?
?
?
Lily!
Guess we were cut off.
?
?
Say, do you fellas know ""Moonlight on the Ganges''?
Grandpa, I'm not gonna wait around here any longer.
If that cornball Caruso calls back, you tell him I've gone to bed!
Oh, I'm so mad I could chew nails!
Eh, Lily, be my guest.
Thank you.
?
Doo-dah, doo-dah?
?
Camptown races doo-dah-doo ?
?
Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dah, doo ?
?
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Grandpa!
Oh, Herman, it's you.
Hi, Grandpa.
I guess I must have dozed off while I was hanging around waiting for you.
Where's Lily?
Oh, she's upstairs waiting for you.
Oh, good.
I had such a good time at the party.
I'm gonna go upstairs and tell her all about it.
You know, let her in on the fun.
Whoopee!
Well, there he goes.
In the mood she's in, she's liable to tear him apart.
Well, lucky I'm good at jigsaw puzzles.
I'd better get upstairs and hit the slab before the trouble starts.
?
?
Hmm.
That's funny.
The door must be stuck.
Lily?
?
Herman's come back home to stay?
?
Doo-dah, doo-dah ?
Lily?
I guess she's not in there.
She's in there, all right.
Lily?
Baby.
I-It's Hermie.
Now-- O-O-Open the door like a good little wifey.
Lily.
No more teasing.
Pussycat wanna go sleepy-bye.
Well, pussycat can just go sleepy-bye on the living room couch!
E-Eh, Lily, stop it.
N-No matter what you do, I'm not coming upstairs.
Lily!
Lily!
Oh.
Cute kitty.
What's that?
It's that leaky faucet in the kitchen.
Hmm.
I'll just ignore it.
I'll shut it off.
What?
I'd better light a match.
John Wayne never has that trouble.
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Oh, good heavens!
Help!
Help!
Help.
!
Help.
!
Help.
!
Help.
!
Help.
!
Pop, what happened?
Help.
!
H-Herman, Herman, wh-what's the matter?
A mouse!
There was a big, mean-looking mouse, and he was after me.
Herman, will you come down from there?
Come down!
He made a face at me-- and he showed his teeth and everything.
Herman, look, he's all gone.
Will you please go to sleep and don't worry about anything?
Don't be scared, Pop.
Me and Grandpa will be right upstairs.
That's right, son.
Now-Now, get along.
Get along to bed.
Come on, Eddie.
Good night.
Oh, good night.
Oh, where is everybody?
Everybody's had breakfast and gone off to school.
Oh.
Grandpa, would you mind telling me why this person is sitting at my table?
I'm waiting for breakfast.
Would you tell this person that everybody who was going to get breakfast already had breakfast.
Lily, I'm hungry!
Eh, as husband, father and head of the household, I demand breakfast!
What's this?
Prune pits.
Three of them.
One for the father, one for the husband and one for the head of the house.
Eh-- Grandpa, what am I going to do?
I can't spend the rest of my married life sleeping on the couch and eating prune pits.
Herman, if you give in now, she'll have the upper hand forever.
But, if you hold out, she'll come around.
That's the way to handle women!
Mmm.
What are you doing?
Well,just in case she doesn't come around, I'm gonna get used to eating prune pits.
Grandpa, this is the fourth night in a row I've slept down here!
When is Lily gonna give in?
Herman, I hate to say it, but I think we're licked.
I'm afraid you just don't have the personality and warmth you used to have.
In other words, my boy, in that great furnace known as romance, your pilot light has gone out.
Grandpa, you certainly have a way with words.
Thank you.
But how am I gonna turn up the burner?
Wait.
I think I have the answer.
Here.
Read this.
""Is your marriage shaky?
""Headed for the rocks?
""See Dr. Harvey Baxter, M.C., Marriage Counselor.
Broken hearts made whole.
'' Ah, Grandpa.
Me go to a marriage counselor?
Marilyn, me go to a marriage counselor?
Yes.
Well, you and Uncle Herman are getting farther apart every day.
And neither of you are going to give in.
I think it's the only solution.
I wouldn't know who to go to.
Well, Aunt Lily, I read an ad in the paper this morning, and so I called and I made an appointment for you for tomorrow.
The man's name is Dr. Harvey Baxter.
All right, I'll try on one condition-- that your Uncle Herman never knows.
Now, as I was saying, my name is Mrs. Mu-- No names, please.
I find that people are less inhibited if they remain anonymous.
Now then, what is your problem?
Well, to begin with, Doctor, I'm married.
Don't be ashamed of it.
Virtually every person who's walked through that door has made the same mistake.
Now, tell me something about your background.
- For instance, where were you born?
- Transylvania.
My father is a count.
And your husband?
No count.
Uh, bitterness is not the answer.
I meant, where was he born?
Oh, my husband was made, Doctor, not born.
Oh, oh, yes, of course.
That's, that's fine.
Every woman should think her husband is a self-made man.
Oh, he had help.
Now, madam, tell me, is there another woman?
No, the doctor quit after Herman.
Well, e-exactly what is the cause of your domestic trouble?
Well, it all started down at his place of employment.
Ah, that is a familiar complaint.
The wife neglected for the job.
I suppose he just buries himself in his work.
Oh, no, no.
Not Herman.
Although there have been a few close calls.
You see, Doctor, the trouble started when they had this party down at the office.
He didn't get home until after 1 2:00.
Aha!
This is an old story to me.
Ah, the gay playboy husband.
But, fortunately, there is an easy solution.
You must go home and apologize immediately.
Me, apologize?
I'm not the one who came home in the middle of the night and sang ""doo-dah, doo-dah'' through the keyhole.
If you take the first step, it will put the burden squarely on his shoulders, and he will realize what a loving, forgiving wife you are.
Well, I'll try it.
But, remember, you must assume the role of peacemaker and be the first to forgive and forget.
Uh, Doctor, I think your secretary's taking a sunbath.
Uh, she jumped out the window and ran up the fire escape to the roof.
Good heavens, man, what happened to you?
Well, you see, my wife and I have had a fight.
You-- You should have defended yourself, man.
No one should stand still and take a beating like that.
Nobody hit me.
You mean there's been no physical violence?
No, Doctor.
My problems are purely emotional.
Yes.
Yes, that's obvious.
Sit down.
Oh, thank you.
Now, uh, let's begin at the beginning.
Well, my wife has locked me out of the bedroom and won't let me in.
Naturally.
But has she done anything unusual?
U-Uh, no, you don't understand, Doctor.
She's not only locked me out of the bedroom, she won't feed me.
Eh, she won't even speak to me.
What was the cause of the quarrel?
Oh.
Well, a few evenings ago I stayed out rather late for business reasons.
Uh, when I got home, my wife was disturbed.
She rejected me and made me sleep downstairs on the couch.
And, Doctor, for the last four days, the only thing I've had my arms around is a Woof-Woof.
My advice to you is this-- that you go home at once and apologize.
- Apologize?
- Exactly.
At any cost you must be the one to take the first step toward reconciliation.
Do not allow your wife to assume the role of peacemaker.
Lily, I want to talk to you.
And I want to talk to you too, darling.
There's something I want to tell you, dear.
Oh, I'll be glad to listen, but I want to tell you something first.
Uh, Lily, dear, if you don't mind, could I tell you what I want to tell you before you tell me what you want to tell me?
Eh-Eh, no, dear.
You let me go first, because what I have to say will save our marriage.
Uh, Lily, if anyone's gonna save our marriage, I'm gonna save our marriage.
Oh, no you're not.
Lily, all I'm trying to do is say I'm sorry and apologize.
You apologize?
B-But you can't apologize to me before I have a chance to apologize to you.
Lily, all I want to be is the peacemaker.
You the peacemaker?
Oh, you big dummy!
I'm going to be the peacemaker, so get that through your thick head!
Lily, will you pipe down while I'm trying to be sweet and apologize?
Ooh.
That does it!
I'm not gonna sit around here a-and be apologized to by a poor insensitive oaf!
.
Lily!
Lily!
Lily!
Lily!
I-I'm sleeping in our bed tonight.
I am!
I am!
I am!
I am!
I am!
I am!
Fiddlesticks!
Oh.
Thank you, son.
Oh, Grandpa, why do you keep fooling around with that when we have such a serious problem on our hands?
Because, my dear, this is going to solve the problem.
This is a formula for instant measles.
Wait a minute.
Who's gonna have the measles?
You are.
But they're synthetic.
No fever.
No scratching.
Just two happy parents reunited.
?
Dee-da, da-da, la-da ?
?
Okay, Eddie, there you go.
You mean I have to drink this stuff?
Drink it?
What do you mean, drink it?
?
?
- Do you think that'll work?
- Certainly.
When Herman and Lily think their little boy is sick, they'll be so worried it'll bring them back together.
Oh, Grandpa, you're a psychologist.
No, I'm not.
It's a trick I learned from watching old Shirley Temple movies.
Herman!
Herman, come quickly!
It's Eddie!
Coming, dear.
!
Coming.
!
Lily!
Lily!
Lily!
Lily, what is it!
?
Oh, I brought him in here, Herman.
Look!
Now, Lily, dear, don't panic.
Herman's here.
We'll think of something together.
Oh, but look at his face.
Ooh.
Oh, Herman.
Oh, you're so kind and sweet and precious and adorable.
And-And sometimes you're a goofball, but I love you.
Oh, Lily, say that again.
U-Uh, um, but this time, dear, leave out ""goofball.
'' It is wonderful-- one minute alone with Grandpa and his measles disappeared.
Not one single mark on that sweet little face.
Oh, it's miraculous.
No, Lily, I understand it perfectly.
Eddie's measles were psychosomatic-- the result of worrying about us quarreling.
Well, he'll never have to worry about that again, will he, pussycat?
Never!
No more office parties for me.
From now on, I'm having all my fun right here at home!
?
?
?
Camptown ladies sing this song ?
?
Doo-dah, doo-dah ?
?
Camptown racetrack five miles long ?

Oh, doo-dah day?
?
Gwine to run all night ?
?
Gwine to run all day?

Bet my money on a bobtail nag ?

Somebody bet on the bay?

{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
?
?
Marilyn, please.
Lily, dear, what are you doing?
I just want you to look your best at supper tonight, Herman.
- We're having company.
- Oh.
Company?
Good.
We haven't had people in for a long time.
We could use some new faces around here.
And, Grandpa, I want you to be on your best behavior at supper.
Now, if you want the ketchup, would you mind not saying, "Shoot me the plasma"?
Okay, okay, but who's the guest?
I promised Eddie he could invite one of his little friends from school to spend the weekend with us.
Oh.
Hi, everybody.
This is Googie Miller.
Googie, this is my mom.
Hi.
Hello, Googie.
And this is my Cousin Marilyn.
Like wow!
And this is my grandfather.
Hi.
Hi.
What are you staring at, my little man?
I never seen a penguin smokin' a cigar before.
And this is my father.
Put it there.
I gotcha that time.
Eddie?
Why don't you take your little friend upstairs until supper is ready.
Okay.
Come on, Googie.
So long, everyone.
Outgoing little fellow, isn't he?
I don't think he's the ideal playmate for our sweet little Eddie.
Well, Marilyn, it-it you know, it may be his parents' fault.
Perhaps that's the way he was brought up.
Brought up?
I've seen better things brought up out of a swamp.
Shh.
Nevertheless, we're gonna make it a nice weekend for Googie.
Not me, Charlie.
I'm cuttin' out of here.
Dinner's just about ready, Herman.
Would you please blow out the candles?
Yes, dear.
Grandpa, would you call the boys?
All right, Lily.
Hey, Googie!
Come on, Googie!
Nice boy.
Grandpa, what are you up to?
Well, Lily, he has a hand buzzer.
Can't I pull a harmless little prank on him?
Put that thing away!
Oh, I never get to have any fun at all.
Boys, supper!
Oh, my!
Doesn't that look yummy?
The boys will be down in a minute.
Now, I want everyone to make a special effort to be nice to Eddie's little friend.
But, Aunt Lily, he's so fresh.
Now, now, Marilyn.
Being kind to people is like investing money in the bank.
When we put kindness in, we get kindness back with interest.
Hi.
Sorry we're late, Mom.
Oh, no, no, you're just in time.
Now, Eddie, you sit over there, and, Googie, you sit right here.
Allow me, Mrs. Munster.
Oh.
Well.
May I?
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Sir?
Oh.
Thank you, son.
Mr. Banker, your investment just hit bottom.
Uncle Herman?
Yes, dear.
I really think you ought to take that little Googie back to his parents.
He's a very bad boy.
I agree with Marilyn.
But gee, Mom, he's the first kid I ever had stay over.
A boy like that will disturb our normal routine.
Oh, there's that Spot begging for food again.
I wish he'd stop that annoying scratching.
Last week, he ripped the back porch clean off.
Spot.
Spot!
Now, Spot, go away!
Spot, go away and stop stop scratching the door!
Go away!
Spot!
Where was I?
Oh, yes.
I think we ought to let Eddie's little friend stay.
It was very nice of his parents to send him over.
And I think it'll be most embarrassing if we take him back now.
Well, where's little Googie now?
He asked Grandpa to show him the lab.
They're down there.
Well, I think he ought to go home before he causes any more trouble.
Marilyn, please!
I'm the head of this household, and if I say he stays, he stays.
When I make a decision around here, it stands up!
Herman, Spot sounds awfully hungry.
Why don't you give him some of the scraps from the table?
Good idea, Lily.
Spot, here you go.
I love to see an animal eat.
It's very nice of you to show me around your wonderful laboratory, sir.
Oh, think nothing of it, son.
And over here here I have my instant disguises.
That's a very nice one you're wearing now, sir.
Yeah.
And over here I'm working on a new cough medicine.
Just one teaspoon of this stuff and you'll cough for three days.
Oh, isn't that exciting.
What's in that old chest there, sir?
Oh, that?
That's my old army footlocker.
What are those?
All us doughboys had our pinup pictures.
And over here, Googie, you see, these are the chemicals that I use in my experiments.
Oh, my.
I bet you can make instant coffee and everything with those.
Yeah.
What's in here?
Don't touch that!
That's nitroglycerine.
There's enough in there to blow up the whole neighborhood.
And right now, I'm working on an old formula.
You see, I'm trying to turn a frog into a prince.
Could you change me into something?
Could I change you into something?
I could change you into any kind of beast you could mention a horse, a crocodile, a unicorn, a rock-and-roll singer, a jackass I'll bet you couldn't even change me into a rabbit.
A rabbit?
That's my easiest trick.
Boy, you should catch me around Easter.
I turn out rabbits faster than rabbits turn out rabbits.
- I'll bet you can't.
- I'll bet I can.
- I'll bet you can't.
- Look, Googie, I'm too busy right now.
But right after lunch, I'll prove it to you.
I'll turn you into a rabbit, and then back into, uh, whatever you are.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
Is Googie down there?
Yes, Eddie, he's here.
Well, would you tell him to come up?
I wanna go out and play.
I'm coming, Eddie.
Thank you, sir, for an enlightening and informative tour of your lab.
Maybe he's not such a bad kid after all.
?
?
Hey, Eddie, after lunch your Grandpa claims he's gonna change me into a rabbit and back.
Grandpa does all kinds of neat tricks.
Well, I've got an idea how to play a neat trick on him.
Come on downtown with me.
I've gotta get something.
I don't wanna play any tricks on Grandpa.
What are you talking about?
He's an adult and we're kids.
It's our duty to do everything in our power to ruin 'em.
- But, Googie - I'll see you after lunch.
"Bubble, bubble, toil and trouble".
That Shakespeare.
What a cornball.
Eddie, have you seen Grandpa?
Here he comes now!
Grandpa!
- What happened to you?
- Never mind what happened to me.
Wait till you see what happens to Googie.
Would you like me to step behind the curtain, sir, for the alleged magic?
Right.
And when we open the curtain, you'll be a beautiful bunny rabbit.
This should be very interesting.
Thank you.
Grandpa, I don't think Lily's gonna like this.
Herman, please.
I just wanna teach this little fellow a lesson.
That when his elders say they can do something, they mean it.
Herman.
I'm ready, sir.
Very good, Googie.
Now just sit perfectly still.
Abadaba abadabit.
Googie is now a bunny rabbit.
Now we shall meet the new Googie.
That's not a rabbit.
A rabbit has longer ears.
Gee, Grandpa, that's the neatest-lookin' trick I ever saw.
- Now turn him back.
- Yeah, sure.
You know, Grandpa, you really outdid yourself.
It's a distinct improvement.
Hi, Googie.
Hi.
Eddie, why don't you go in the house?
I'm trying to concentrate.
Okay.
Good-bye, Googie.
Hey, Herman.
Uh, please.
Sit right there, Googie.
Don't move.
Herman, please!
Alacazamo alacazoy.
Turn back to a little boy.
Now, let's see.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
The brat won't un-monkey.
Grandpa, you gotta do something soon.
If Lily finds out, she'll be upset.
Quiet, Herman.
I'm getting ready.
He'll be right with you, fella.
Stand back.
Stand back.
I'm going to use number XL-438.
This is the one that took Abraham Lincoln out of that log cabin and put him in the White House.
Ibbety bibbety ibbety sassie.
Ex post facto  Raymond Massey.
I did it.
I did it.
Herman, help me up.
I know it worked.
It takes a lot out of me, but it always works.
Herman, I blew the bit.
Come on.
Come on.
There's only one thing to do, and you've gotta do it immediately.
What is it, Herman?
Go down to the market and lay in a big supply of bananas.
He thinks he changed me into a monkey.
This is great.
There you are, Googie.
It's all yours.
Eddie?
Would you please go and play somewhere?
Please?
But I wanna watch you change Googie back to Googie.
Eddie, your grandfather's busy.
Will you go upstairs and play?
Okay, but I never get to see any neat stuff.
How are you doing?
Well, according to my calculations here, if we wait 30,000 years, evolution just might help solve the problem.
Grandpa, Googie's gotta be back in school on Monday.
Why don't you turn him into a frog?
And then turn the frog into a prince?
And then turn the prince back into Googie?
No, I've been working on that frog-prince formula for five years.
And all I got to show for it is a velvet suit and 400 sick frogs.
Eddie, psst.
Hey, Eddie, come here.
Googie!
What are you doing here?
I just left you in the lab eating a banana.
That wasn't me.
That was Chimpo.
I borrowed him from the pet shop.
That's the big joke I wanted to play on your old grandpa.
Well, that's a dirty trick.
And I'm gonna go tell him what you did right now.
All right, Eddie.
You go in there and do that.
And do you know what I'm gonna do?
What?
I'm going in there and tell your parents this whole thing was your idea, and you made me get the chimp and everything.
- Would you really do that?
- Sure I would.
Now you and me are gonna hide out at the movies and really drive them out of their skulls.
Okay, I guess I gotta.
But you're the meanest kid I ever knew.
You're a rat and a rat fink and a miserable little brat.
Gee, thanks, Eddie.
My analyst said what I needed was recognition.
All right.
Yes, I'll tell my Aunt Lily right now.
Marilyn, who was that on the phone?
Googie's mother.
It seems they have some relatives coming tonight, and they'd like it if he could come home just as soon as possible.
Well, that's a lucky break.
Now we can get rid of the little darling.
I think Grandpa and Herman are amusing him in the lab.
Herman.
!
Yes Yes, dear?
Is Googie down there?
Oh, he's here, all right.
Well, Mrs. Miller phoned.
They're having company and they want us to bring him home as soon as we can.
- Bring him home, Lily?
- Yes, dear.
I want you to take him over.
Marilyn and I have to go to the market before it closes.
All right, dear.
Is everything all right down there?
Fine!
We're having more fun than a barrel of monkeys.
What did you have to go and say that for?
I don't know.
I just went "ape".
Herman, will you cut that out!
We're in big trouble here.
Wait a minute.
I have an idea.
Is Googie's suitcase still up in his room?
Sure, but Listen.
Here's what we do.
Grandpa, I have the car out front.
Hurry up!
Quiet, Herman!
Oh, I sure hope this works, Herman.
Come on, Googie.
Come on.
We're all going home now.
Oh, don't you look nice.
Oh, boy.
It's dark outside.
Chances are his parents won't notice the difference.
What a day!
I sure got up on the wrong side of the slab this morning.
Come on, Herman!
Let's get out of here!
Herman!
Grandpa!
We're home!
Uncle Herman?
Grandpa?
They're not here.
I guess they're delivering Eddie's little friend back to his parents.
Oh, thank goodness.
What an annoying weekend.
Well, when they drop little Googie off at the Millers, our troubles will be over.
Okay, Herman, this is the number.
Let's go.
All right, but let's not get into a big conversation with the Millers.
Big conversation?
All I'm gonna do is ring the bell, leave the kid and we'll fly.
You wait here.
Come on, Googie.
Oh, Googie.
Look what you did to your jacket.
Yes?
We brought your son home, Mr. Miller.
He's a great boy.
We loved having him.
Good night.
Thank you, but won't you come in?
No, thanks.
We have to run.
Yes, we have to run.
Good night.
Good night.
Googie, where are your manners?
You didn't even say good night.
Googie.
!
Come back here, you two!
What have you done to my boy?
Grandpa, I think he noticed the difference.
Come on, you big dummy.
Let's head for the car.
Stop!
Come back!
Help.
!
Yes, Mr. Miller, this is Mrs. Munster.
But I can't understand you, sir, unless you stop screaming.
Monkey?
I really don't understand.
All I know is that my husband left to take your little boy home Hi, Mom.
Hello, Mrs. Munster.
- We were at the movies.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Miller, but your son just walked in.
We'll bring him right Oh, you will?
All right, we'll have him ready.
Eddie, you should have told us if you were going to the movies.
And, Googie, your father is so upset he's incoherent.
Now your parents are expecting relatives, and your father is coming right over to get you.
So you run on upstairs and get ready.
Yes, ma'am.
Aunt Lily?
I thought Uncle Herman took Googie home.
I don't know how he's done it, but he's goofed it again.
Grandpa, I'm scared.
That strange car out front.
After what we did with Googie, do you suppose it's the police?
Well, it's either that or the S.P.C.A.
Come on.
We've gotta get to the dungeon.
Herman, we can lock ourselves in the dungeon for 20 or 30 years till this thing blows over.
Oh.
If we're gonna be there that long, I'll need a change of socks.
Herman, please!
Mrs. Munster, I can't tell you what a shock this whole thing has been to me.
Well, Mr. Miller, everything is all right now.
And you can take him back home to see his relatives.
Oh.
They just came back for his suitcase.
I guess when they got a good look at him, they liked him better as a monkey.
Hey!
Hey!
He's not a monkey anymore.
He's changed back to a kid.
Boy, that Abraham Lincoln bit must have had a delayed fuse on it.
Grandpa, we're in the clear.
Well, like I said, I've got company coming.
So I've got to get going.
That's right.
I understand.
Would you mind coming outside for a minute, please?
A monkey?
Yes, it's a little present for you.
Some wise guy in white tie and tails left it at my house.
White tie and tails?
I think I know who that is.
Well, good night, Mr. Miller.
Good night.
Good night.
Herman, Grandpa, kindly explain this.
He's changed back again.
Oh, no.
And I wanted to tell you that the monkey came from the pet store, but Googie wouldn't let me.
- He said it was a funny joke.
- Eddie, it's not a funny joke when it's at the expense of your poor, old, broken-down grandfather.
Thank you, Herman.
Eddie, you're getting off very easy.
Why, back in the Old Country, if I had done something like this, my father would have bit my head off.
Gee, I'm sorry.
If you go with bad companions, some of it is bound to rub off on you.
Exactly.
Which brings to mind a famous old quotation "He who lies down with dog, gets up with fleas".
- Who said that, Daddy?
- I'm not sure.
I think it was the man who trains Lassie.
Well, I agree.
Eddie should be punished.
Oh, but I hate to see that awful Googie get away with this.
Marilyn, he shan't.
Tomorrow morning, I'm going over to Mr. Miller's and tell him what his boy has done, and point out to him that he has neglected his duty as a father.
I'm also gonna give him the benefit of my vast experience as a parent and a human being.
Thank you.
Herman, why don't you just telephone him and tell him now?
No, Lily.
I wanna meet him face-to-face, so he can get the full impact.
Hmm.
That little fella is sure in a hurry to get back to the pet store.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
You know, Lily, it's very nice to relax after supper.
Did you have a hard day at the parlor, dear?
Did I?
People were in and out all day.
Eh, don't complain, Herman.
You should be grateful you've got a going business.
What is it you've got there, Herman?
Popcorn.
L-I thought I'd make some and sort of keep things jumping.
Now you stay there, Spot, and be a good boy.
Hey, Dad, I got a new record today.
Is it okay if I play it on the phonograph?
Why, of course, Eddie.
I think it's very nice for a young boy to be interested in music.
You know, Eddie, back in the Old Country, you couldn't keep me away from good music.
Hmm!
Why, I used to haunt the opera house night and day.
Turn the horn around, Eddie, so that we can all hear it.
Huh.
?
?
-    But, Pop, they're The Standells.
Every kid in school is crazy about 'em.
And they're coming to town for a concert.
Boy, I'd give anything to meet 'em face-to-face.
Whew, Eddie  We can all be thankful that that will never happen.
Okay, okay, Pops.
So we're picking up 8,000 for a one-night stand in this town.
We don't want to get stomped to death.
Yeah, that last hotel was too much with those 2,000 screaming kids in the lobby.
Look, why don't you rent us a mansion with a couple of swimming pools.
Like you did in Beverly Hills.
You guys wrecked the last two places like that cost us $15,000 damages.
Well, then get us a place on the outskirts, one we can't hurt.
Hey, that's a good idea.
Right on.
Yeah.
Well, all right.
All right.
I've got a real estate agent working on it, and he's spotted a place.
"1313 Mockingbird Lane".
It's owned by some people named, uh, "Munster".
I'm going out there now and try to make a deal.
Yeah, when those Munsters find out what we're willing to pay, they'll practically fall over dead.
It's nice you're interested in our house, Mr. Murdock, but it simply isn't for rent.
But it would be just right for these, uh, friends of mine.
And I'm prepared to make a very attractive offer.
Oh, but my aunt and uncle are out right now, and Grandfather's up in the attic.
Oh, uh, working?
Oh, no.
He just likes to hang around up there.
I only want to rent the place for my clients for the weekend.
And we're prepared to pay $500.
Well, I really don't believe they'd consider renting it.
Are you sure you heard me right, miss?
I said $1,500 for a weekend.
Oh, well, that's very generous, but they're very touchy about having strangers in the house.
In all the years that we've lived here, I can't recall more than eight or nine people ever getting past the front door.
Yes.
Well, uh, you folks think it over.
And have your aunt or uncle call me, huh?
Here's my card.
Oh, thank you.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
Even my boys couldn't hurt this dump.
This Mr. Murdock seemed very anxious to rent the place.
But $1,500, just for the weekend?
Must be some congressman here on government business.
Mm-hmm.
I don't think so.
He called back three times.
And he said he'd even put us all up at a hotel if we'd rent the place.
But we don't even know who the man represents.
L-I mean, what would the neighbors think if they saw a bunch of strange-looking people living in our home?
Grandpa, we could use the money.
We still owe that bill to the vet from the last time you went out prowling a-and caught distemper.
Grandpa, if you'd taken your shots when I told you to, you could have saved us $400.
Hey, Mom, if we do rent the place, could I use some of the money to buy Spot a new toy?
Oh, Eddie, we gave him a foreign sports car for Christmas.
He played with it a couple of times, and then he threw it over the back fence.
Uncle Herman, what should I tell the man if he calls back again?
Marilyn, dear, I've thought the thing over from all angles, and I have come to a conclusion.
We will accept the man's offer.
That is my decision as head of the house.
That's all right with you, isn't it, pussycat?
Oh, uh, Lily, I'm gonna leave the key under the mat, dear, for our temporary tenants.
We don't want any burglars getting in here.
Eh, Herman, how are our tenants going to know that the key is under the mat?
Please, Grandpa, I've taken care of everything.
I hope those tenants don't ruin our beautiful yard.
Oh, dear, yes.
It's taken us years to get it in this condition.
Lily, I've taken care of that too, dear.
Wait a minute!
I forgot to say good-bye to Spot.
Good-bye, Spot!
We're leaving now, Spot!
Now, you be a good boy while we're gone.
He's a good fellow, isn't he?
What is that?
You got me.
Since when has the morgue been giving curb service?
Grandpa, Lily, Marilyn, you go on in and register.
I'll park the car.
There's a sign underground garage.
Underground?
Herman, let me go with you.
I might run into a few old friends.
No, Grandpa.
You go on in with the girls and keep an eye on them.
There are lots of fresh traveling salesmen in hotel lobbies.
May I?
Yeah, here.
What do you got in here?
Just my father's extra pair of shoes.
Hey, guys, what do you think of this coop?
Reminds me of the converted car barn we played in San Francisco.
Hey - What was that?
- Well, it was no swallow from Capistrano.
Hey, look at this thing.
?
?
That's crazy, man.
You can see the notes while you play 'em.
Hey, dig this lopsided "geetar".
Wow.
Wow.
?
?
That's swing.
Hey, guys, you know what?
This calls for a party.
That's a good idea.
Let's get on the horn and call us up some playmates.
Now you're talking!
Eh, say, uh, what's this thing?
Uh, that's the air conditioner, sir.
Well, turn it on.
The air seems awfully fresh in here.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Mom, can I go out and walk around the ledge?
Oh, no.
No, Eddie.
You might fall off and hurt somebody.
Now you go right in, Eddie, and get ready for bed.
No dust!
And at these prices too!
Uh, uh, Grandpa, the bellboy is holding out his hand.
What for?
You're supposed to grease his palm.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Where were you, Herman?
Oh, Lily, I had a terrible time parking.
Yeah.
You know, I think this hotel is having labor trouble.
Just as I drove in their underground garage, the attendant quit.
What kind of a dump is this?
Mom, I don't think I can sleep in that creepy bed.
Could I sleep in the dresser drawer?
At least it has handles on it.
We'll see, Eddie.
Oh, Herman, I don't know about this place.
I wish we were back in our own cozy little house enjoying a nice, quiet evening.
The Smith Brothers have arrived!
Sorry to hear about that eye.
Hey, sweetheart  Hey, Tony, Nick, the P.T.A. Have arrived!
Come on in.
Oh, Herman, I thought we were going to spend an enjoyable weekend away from home, but nothing has worked out.
I agree, dear.
I think it's ridiculous to put up with all these hardships and inconveniences.
But how can we go home?
We signed that lease.
Oh, I don't care if we did.
We'll just ask them to leave.
I'm with you all the way, dear.
Eh, but will you do the talking?
All right.
Oh, Marilyn, will you get Grandpa so we can get going?
Come on, Grandpa.
I'll be right with you.
?
?
?
Everybody we know?
?
I'm gonna set you straight This dance is great?
Herman, look at all the cars.
What's going on here?
And look at the house.
It's all lit up.
Yes, it sure gives it an eerie effect.
Listen!
I hear music.
Those people who rented our house are throwing a party.
Lily, let's go back to the hotel.
Herman, Herman, no, no.
We'll do no such thing.
That is our house, and those people are throwing a wild party.
Now you, as head of the family, will go right in there and demand that they leave!
?
I'm gonna set you straight This dance is great?
?
Come on and Ringo?
Go ahead and knock.
All right.
Eh, look here, l Come on in.
Hey, Zeno, some cats from L.A. Just blew in.
Look, you don't understand.
We Go on in and mingle, doll!
Come on in.
We don't know anybody either.
?
Everybody Ringo?
?
I'm gonna set you straight This dance is great?
?
Come on and Ringo?
Did you dig that crazy getup?
Man, is that way out!
Did you see the hairdo on the tall one?
It's the greatest thing since Carl Sandburg.
?
Energy to do this dance for you?
?
We showed you how to Ringo?
?
Come on and let yourself go?
?

Herman, say something.
Pardon me, young man, but do you think I could Uh, just cool it, man.
You'll get your chance.
?
?
?
Oh, yeah, I'll tell you something?
?
I think you'll understand?
Hey, Dad, those neat guys are The Standells!
?
When I say that something?
?
I want to hold your hand?
You mean those are the people who rented our house?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
Oh, please, say to me?
?
You'll let me be your man?
?
And, please, say to me?
?
You'll let me hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
You know, Herman ?
And when I touch you?
They do have a certain style.
?
I feel happy?
Yes.
They are rather razzmatazz.
?
Inside?
?
It's such a feeling that my love?
You know, they're almost as good as Kate Smith.
?
I can't hide.
!
I can't hide?
?
I can't hide?
?
Yeah, you've got that something?
?
I think you'll understand?
?
When I say that something?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
Grandpa, doesn't that send you out of this world?
?
And when I touch you?
?
I feel happy inside?
So what?
I've been there before.
?
It's such a feeling that my love?
?
I can't hide.
!
I can't hide?
?
I can't hide?
?
Yeah, you've got that something?
Sweetheart, you're not a bit like the rest of your group.
Yes, I know.
I'm the plain one in the family.
?
When I say that something?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
I want to hold your hand?
?
Cool it!
Cool it, everybody!
Cool it!
Cool it!
The hermit's gonna groove us!
This reminds me of that wild party at Mayerling just before the grand duke went upstairs and blew his brains out.
?
?
In the vortex of the future of that cool tomorrow land, ?
?
We'll all wig there, play a gig there in that great nonunion band.
Scuba doo and scuba dabba.
Life's a gas, and life's a grabba.
Hip is hip, and groove is groovy.
Life's a wild Fellini movie.
When that hairy fist of silence slugs us, bugs us, puts us down Hmm.
We'll all wing it, we'll all sing it: "Guy Lombardo's back in town".
Oh, that guy sure cuts away the tinsel, don't he?
Oh, Grandpa, isn't this a fun party?
Yes, I haven't seen so many good-looking people in one place since we closed down the mausoleum back home.
Let's hear from theJolly Green Giant!
Yeah!
Come on, Herman!
O-Oh, oh, no.
Not me.
Oh, dear, I think he's going to recite.
Um ?
?
Ibbity bibbity sibbity sab.
L-Ibbity bibbity canal boat.
Dictionary down the ferry.
Mary, Mary, quite contrary.
?
?
Um, Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear.
Fuzzy Wuzzy lost his hair.
S-Scuba doo and scuba die.
That chicken's not too young to fry.
L-Life is real, life is earnest.
If you're cold, turn up the furnace.
Th l-I thank you.
Man, that cat is deep.
Yeah, what a message.
And now we have a rare treat in store for you.
A truly great talent, and a member of my own family.
I would like to present to you, group, that swinging chick from Transylvania, my wife.
!
Eh, let's all hear it for Lily!
Go ahead, Aunt Lily.
Don't be shy.
Cats, you ain't heard nothin' yet!
Get a load of this cat you'd think he owned the place.
Thank you, pussycat.
?
?
?
He's goin'?
?
He's goin' away?
?
For to stay?
?
A little while?
?
But he's comin' back?
?
If he goes?
?
10,000 miles?
?
Oh, who will tie?
?
My shoe?
?
And who will comb?
?
My hair?
?
And who will kiss?
?
My ruby lips?
?
When he is gone?
?
Look away?
?
Look away?
?
Over Yandro?
?
Oh, brother will tie?
?
My shoe?
?
And sister will comb?
?
My hair?
?
And you will kiss?
?
My ruby lips?
?
When you?
?
Come home?
?
Look away?
?
Look away?
?
Over Yandro?
?
Well, good night, fellas.
Oh, listen.
Good night.
If your act ever dies, give me a call at the parlor.
Ah.
So long.
We really dig you people!
And someday we'll return the favor.
Bye.
Bye.
So long.
Look, Pop, I got their autograph.
"To Eddie Munster, a real gone gasser.
Sincerely, The Standells".
Huh!
Well, isn't that nice, Eddie?
You know, Lily, I'm gonna sleep a lot better tonight, dear, knowing that the future of America is in the hands of boys like these.
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning, Grandpa.
Good morning.
Oh, what an evening.
You know, I fell asleep the moment my head hit the slab.
You're a little late this morning, Grandpa.
Let me heat up your coffee.
It's all right, Lily.
I'll take care of it.
Well, Uncle Herman, we certainly had a lot of fun last night, didn't we?
We certainly did, dear.
But you know something, Marilyn?
It's nice just to be the plain old Munsters again.
And go back to normal living.
Oh, you're so right, Herman.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Morning, Eddie.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Herman's home.
Lily, either hang those things so they don't fall down or have them tuned.
Lily?
Lily!
I have some wonderful news for you, and I can't keep it in any longer.
I'm busting at the seams.
Well, don't do it in here, dear.
I'm getting supper.
I have to tell you what happened today.
Mr. Gateman down at the parlor asked me into his private office, and he gave me a great compliment.
He said I'm one of the few people there who never lies down on the job.
Oh, Herman, you've really stuck to the job down there.
You've seen a lot of people come and go.
Well, don't keep us in midair.
What did your boss say?
He gave me a promotion.
He's making me manager of one of our branch offices.
Oh, manager!
Oh, wait till Grandpa's relatives in the Old Country hear about this!
They'll really sit up on their hind legs and take notice.
There's only one thing.
For me to take the job, we have to sell the house and move to Buffalo.
- Sell the house?
- Sell the house?
That's right.
And then all we Munsters will just shuffle off to Buffalo.
?
Oh, I'll go and get my shoesies and we'll pack up all our bluesies?
?
And away we'll go?
?
Ooh, ooh, ooh?
?
Off we're gonna shuffle shuffle off to Buffalo?
?
Uh, Spot?
Spot!
Go fetch!
Bring back Daddy.
And, uh, inasmuch as this new job touches all our futures, I thought it very important to convene the entire family.
Big deal.
We were all sitting here, anyway.
All you had to do was start talking.
By the way, where's Eddie?
He's spending the weekend with one of his little friends from school.
Oh, yes.
Well, uh, now, on the pro side of this thing, this promotion will mean a sizable increase in salary, plus a lot of other benefits, which will accrue.
But, on the other hand, it is also gonna mean that we Lily?
Grandpa?
Oh, where did everyone go?
Herman, we're all here.
Oh.
Oh, yes.
Uh, of course.
As I was saying, now Uh, but, on the other hand, it will also mean selling this beautiful home, with all its charm and graciousness and exquisite furniture.
And I thought that, in a matter so vital to all of us, we should put it to a family vote.
Uh, Lily?
Herman, a wife's place is with her husband.
Whither thou goest, I shall go.
Good.
Lily has decided to "whither" with me.
Marilyn?
Oh, I'd be happy to move to Buffalo.
Maybe I'll meet some boys who won't think I'm so plain.
Good.
Grandpa?
It's all right with me.
I'm as free as a bat.
I can pull up stakes anytime.
Fine.
Then it's all settled.
I'll call Mr. Gateman, tell him I'll take the new job, and we'll put an ad in the newspaper and sell this house.
There's one person we haven't consulted yet little Eddie.
Oh, well, I'm sure he'll go for it.
Children always adjust very easily to any new environment.
It was neat, Eddie, the way Coach made you catcher and picked you for the captain of the baseball team.
There's a lot of guys better than me.
What I think sold the coach was the way you snagged up those foul tips with your teeth.
You know, Eddie, now that you're on our team, we'll probably win the city championship.
I hope so.
I sure like going to this school and all the guys I met.
You know, I'd rather live here than any other place in the whole world.
Last year, our best shortstop's family moved him to another school district, and we lost the finals.
So all us guys took an oath never to speak to him again.
You don't have to worry about that.
Once, my mother told me we were gonna live where we are for the rest of our lives, and maybe even longer.
Oh, boy, somebody's stopping.
Naturally.
This is the kind of house that would stand out in any neighborhood.
This must be it, Mother.
"1313 Mockingbird Lane".
Oh, my!
That's the kind of a house in those Alfred Hitchcock pictures that always gets hit by lightning.
Oh, my goodness!
Don't sit there, Daddy.
Let's burn rubber!
Look at the way they took off.
Well, we wouldn't want to sell it to any hot-rodders, anyway.
My, what a setup, eh, Momma?
First, we run the séances.
Then we make with the phony ghosts.
Then we rake in the dough.
Yeah, Poppa.
Eh, it's a little clean, but it'll do.
Now listen, kids.
Don't steal nothing till we make the deal, eh?
Yes?
Poppa, what do you think?
I think the gypsies got here first and spook the place already.
Uh, excuse the intrude.
Uh, good luck, brother.
Grandpa, get inside, quick.
Herman, what's the matter?
You look as black as a sheet.
Those were gypsies.
They cast spells, practice sorcery and give people the evil eye.
Oh, I'm glad they didn't buy our house.
Me too.
I can't stand competition.
Oh, Herman, we've had open house all day.
And the few people who did show up didn't even come in.
I just can't understand it.
This house offers everything a family could want.
And we're close-in, and we have a beautiful yard with a kidney-shaped swamp.
Oh!
Susie, if this place is for sale, there must be some wonderful old relics inside.
Perhaps we can pick them up for a song.
Oh!
Oh.
D-Do you think we should knock?
I think we should go right in.
The sign says "open house".
Susan, what a quaint old house.
And just look at this antique hat rack.
Oh!
The wormholes are already in it.
Isn't that fine!
We won't have to drill our own.
Ooh!
And just look at that newel post.
I bet they don't realize its value.
We'll tell 'em it's a lot of junk and then practically steal it.
Uh, did you hear something, Lily?
Oh, that's just Spot, dear.
He's had indigestion all morning.
Oh.
I guess he got out again and got ahold of some bad telephone poles.
Grandpa, we want you to sit on the house for a while.
Marilyn and I have to go downtown shopping, and Herman has to go out too.
Yes.
If we're gonna move, we're gonna have to pack a lot of things.
I'm gonna stop by the parlor and pick up some empty boxes.
I'll have the house sold before you get back.
Don't worry about a thing, Lily.
I won't let anyone get away.
Oh, how could you, Grandpa?
What's the matter?
If someone goes for the chicken sandwich, we got a deal.
Grandpa?
We'll have none of that.
What we want is someone who loves the house for its charm alone.
Spoilsport.
Pops?
Pops?
Uh, please.
Come on.
Wake up!
Let me sleep another hundred years.
Pops.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, tell me something.
This your ad in the paper?
Yes.
This the price?
That's right.
I'll take it.
You'll take it?
But you haven't seen it yet.
Do you wanna argue or sell the house?
Yeah, but Here's a check for the down payment.
Just sign this contract for the temporary bill of sale.
Ooh!
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Yeah, thank you.
Forget it.
Oh, and, uh, Pops, if I were you, I'd get back in the house.
You look like you've been out in the sun too long.
Grandpa, that's wonderful.
You sold the house.
Well, it did take all my charm and powers of salesmanship, but I really put on the pressure and closed that deal.
Now we can move to Buffalo, and Uncle Herman can take his new job.
Oh, boy, old Hermie's got it made.
?
I'll go up and get my shoesies and we'll pack up all our bluesies?
?
And away we'll go?
?
Ooh, ooh, ooh?
?
Off we're gonna shuffle shuffle off to Buffalo?
?
Hey, what's all the excitement?
Did Grandpa win the Transylvanian sweepstakes?
No, Eddie, but we have some wonderful, wonderful news for you.
Yeah?
Well, I've got some good news too.
It's about the school baseball team.
Eddie, uh, just a minute.
Your father has a new job.
We just sold the house.
And we're all moving to Buffalo.
- Isn't that wonderful, Eddie?
- I won't go!
I won't!
I won't!
I won't!
You can't make me!
You can't!
You can't!
I'm not gonna leave my friends!
I'm not!
I'm not!
I'm not!
You can kill me a million, million times, and I still won't go.
!
You know, Lily, I don't think he exactly cares for the idea.
Grandpa, I wonder how Herman's making out with Eddie.
He's upstairs now, trying to calm him down.
I had no idea he'd be so upset about moving and leaving his friends.
I know how it is.
In the Old Country, I was always getting attached to my friends and neighbors, especially at night.
Well, one thing about Herman he has a way of getting to the heart of a matter.
And so the little rabbit said to the prairie dog, "Listen, prairie dog, why do you take your family and move out of a perfectly good burrow to someplace far away"?
What's a burrow?
Burrow?
Well, it's sort of like a home, sort of.
But what the little rabbit was trying to tell the prairie dog was that he shouldn't move just because he thought the food was better somewhere else.
I think it's dumb for a rabbit to tell a prairie dog what to do.
Exactly.
And you know what happened?
What?
The prairie dog did move with his whole family, and he found out the food was better and the new burrow was better, and he made lots of new friends and everything was neato!
And the stupid rabbit stayed where he was and ate the dumb food and stayed with his dumb friends.
Right.
And somebody probably caught the rabbit and painted him pink for Easter or something.
Exactly.
That's what the rabbit got for not grasping at an opportunity and moving to a new place.
So, you see what a good idea it would be for us all to move to Buffalo?
And the prairie dog probably got eaten by a kangaroo, 'cause he never saw kangaroos before, and because they didn't have kangaroos where he used to live.
Right.
Uh, uh, no.
No.
No, wrong.
Wrong, wrong.
Uh, Eddie, kangaroos don't eat prairie dogs.
Uh, they're allergic to them.
And the stupid rabbit stayed where he was and got fat and had pink kids!
Wait a minute.
The prairie dog is the hero of this story, not the rabbit.
And the rabbit sent letters to the prairie dog, but they came back unanswered.
So the rabbit knew it was smarter to stay in his own burrow than moving away and getting eaten up by a kangaroo.
Wait a minute Boy, Dad, thanks for telling me the neat story.
Now I can sleep tonight without worrying about moving to Buffalo.
Gee, Dad, I'm glad you came up here and explained it to me.
Yeah.
Sure, Eddie.
So am I. Bye, Mom.
Bye, Dad.
Bye, son.
Now I can go to school and tell all the guys that I don't have to move and that I can be the captain of the school baseball team.
Boy, this is the neatest thing that's happened since Grandpa dug up Spot for me.
Bye, Spot.
That happy little skip in that happy little boy is worth a fortune to his dear, old dad.
Herman, what happened?
Last night, you went up to explain to Eddie why we had to move to Buffalo.
Suddenly, this morning, it's all off.
Well, I tried to explain it to him, but it just didn't work out.
I guess I should've used the Three Little Pigs.
You know, I've always been rotten with prairie dogs.
Well, I'm glad it happened.
It just proves to all of us how much we love this place.
I agree, Marilyn.
Grandpa, you go call that gentleman and tell him we want out of the house deal.
I'm gonna go down to the parlor and tell Mr. Gateman that I just can't take the new job.
Herman, he'll be disappointed, so let him down gently.
Lily, have no fear.
In my business, we always let people down gently.
But, Mr. Dennison, we changed our minds.
What do you mean we can't?
A sales contract?
Bulldozers, wreckers on their way over now?
Uh, Mr. Dennison, just a minute.
You can't talk to me that way.
I guess he can.
- Can we get our house back, Grandpa?
- I guess not, Eddie.
They're on their way over now with bulldozers to tear it down.
Grandpa, what'll we do?
Herman's down at the parlor, and those men will be here any minute.
What'll we do?
We'll do what men have done for centuries.
We'll stand firm and defend our homes.
We'll man the battlements, flood the moat and pull in the drawbridge.
But, Grandpa, we don't have any battlements or any moat.
Marilyn, will you please Don't be so technical.
I haven't had so much fun since I started the French Revolution.
The chains, Eddie!
Right, Grandpa.
?
?
Here's Grandma's best silver.
Grandma's best silver.
Twenty pounds of bobby pins.
That oughta curl their hair.
Uh, here's one of Eddie's skates.
Oh, Eddie's skates.
?
?
Wait till they get a taste of this cast-iron fruit salad.
Here they come!
Oh, I won't fire unless I have to.
I sure hope I have to.
They think they can scare us off.
Listen, you people, I bought this house to wreck it, and I'm gonna wreck it.
Hold off, sir!
Our home is our castle, and we shall defend it, down to the last man, woman and child.
How do you like them apples, mister?
What is this?
We've run into trouble like this before.
When we built those freeways, the little old ladies tried to throw themselves down in front of the bulldozers.
How come those weird getups?
You know these radicals.
They'll do anything to get their picture in the paper.
All right, fellas.
Get movin'.
Okay, stand back, people.
We're comin' through.
Okay, they're asking for it.
C'est la vie.
That's the way I goofed at Waterloo.
All right, folks.
You had your little joke.
Come on now.
Break it up.
Yeah, Pops, knock it off.
What's going on here?
Are they kidding with him?
It's just another one of those Halloween makeups to try to get us off their backs.
Oh, Herman!
It's been a nightmare.
These men are gonna tear down our house, and Mr. Dennison won't listen to reason.
So we've been protecting ourselves.
Lily, please.
We'll have to think this thing over.
After all, we did sign that paper.
I knew it!
I knew it!
Little Goody Two-shoes had to show up.
Grandpa, right is right.
If they bought the house, they have a right to tear it down.
And you can't just go around aiming a cannon at everybody without having anarchy.
And anarchy is violence.
And violence is very naughty.
What are you going to do, Uncle Herman, just let them take the house from us?
Marilyn, we shouldn't have signed that piece of paper without reading it.
No, I'm going to ask them if they'll allow us a few weeks to find a place to live.
Aw, Pop, let's smash 'em now and talk later.
Eddie, please!
Uh, good afternoon, gentlemen.
Uh, I think there's something we should discuss.
Listen, jack.
I bought this house to tear it down and put in a parking lot.
So why don't you just get out.
But, sir, uh, uh Uh, we Uh Gentlemen, gentlemen, I think we should talk this thing over.
Uh, now, look.
You seem to be reasonable types.
Uh, if you look at the thing my Oh.
If you look at the thing my way, you'll just go back to your office and tear up that contract.
You see, Lily?
If you reason with people, they'll see the light.
They were in such a hurry to get back and tear up the contract, they left their machinery behind.
Herman, you saved our home.
Pop, you're a hero.
Oh, shucks, it it was nothing.
Herman.
Herman, we don't want the neighbors to think we keep an untidy place.
Go out and pick up the street.
Yes, dear.
"And the property, therefore, reverts to the original owner, Herman Munster".
That's wonderful!
That's great!
We have our house back.
Signed R. Dennison.
Hmm.
Poor man writes with a shaky hand.
What did they say down at the parlor, dear?
Oh, well, Mr. Gateman decided not to open the branch office in Buffalo.
He says he can't afford it.
Can't afford it?
No.
He just went over the books for the last two months and found out we've been going in the hole.
Oh, hi, Eddie.
Eddie, you home from school so soon?
Lily, you had them tuned!
Eddie, how was baseball practice today?
Eddie, uh, turn around, son.
Come here.
Come here.
Herman, there's no two ways about it.
We're simply going to have to buy Eddie a catcher's mitt.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Good morning.
Good morning, Eddie.
Eddie, I'm very upset with you this morning.
I told you to keep Spot's water dish filled out in the yard.
Last night he got thirsty, and he went down the street and drained Mr. And Mrs. Hazlett's pool.
- I'm sorry.
I forgot.
- Well, Mrs. Hazlett just phoned.
She was very embarrassed when her husband went out to take his morning dip and dove into an empty pool.
What kind of a neighborhood is this where people begrudge a poor, dumb animal a drink of water?
Good morning, everybody.
Good morning.
Morning, dear.
What are your plans for the weekend, dear?
I just thought I'd stick around the house.
As a matter of fact, I thought I might work on the car.
It needs a thorough checkup.
Herman, please, take it to the service station.
You're not very mechanical.
You're all thumbs.
No, I'm not.
Hmph.
What, do you think I was put together by some kind of nut?
Well, please be careful.
Every time you plan a weekend project, you get in trouble.
Lily, please.
Don't be silly, dear.
How could a clear-thinking, intelligent person such as I get in any kind of trouble?
Hmm?
If you'll get up out of the oatmeal, I'll tell you.
Alfred, that looks like the perfect spot to stage our next accident the intersection of Mockingbird Lane and Maple Drive.
Yeah, it's a nice, quiet residential neighborhood.
But where are we gonna get a victim, now that Double-jointed Benny's been picked up by the cops?
Alfred, I gotta admit that with that scarred face of his and his knack for being able to throw his bones out of joint, the insurance companies did pay off without a second look.
Now, don't worry.
We'll find somebody to take his place.
But where?
This is a big city, Alfred.
Somewhere there must be some big, stupid guy with a face that looks like it's been in an accident before it happens.
What's new in the paper, Grandpa?
Oh, nothing much.
The New York Museum is sending some archaeologist to Transylvania.
Hmm.
Well, I hope they don't dig up anyone we know.
Say, listen to this.
"Police Seek Accident Ring".
Oh, what's that about?
Well, they're after a bunch of crooks who stage phony accidents to gyp the insurance companies.
Phony accidents.
Yes.
Isn't that terrible?
Everything is so synthetic these days.
Well, I checked the oil and the transmission.
Now all I have to check is the differential.
Are you gonna jack up the rear end?
Exactly what I'm gonna do.
I'll go get the wrench, Pop.
The corner of Mockingbird Lane and Maple Drive oughta be around here somewhere.
But,J.R., what's the sense of sizing it up for an accident when we don't even have a victim?
First, we gotta get the lay of the land, then the victim.
Look,J.R. There's some character working under that wild-lookin' hot rod.
Maybe he could tell us where Maple Drive is.
Uh, say, buddy?
Uh, yes.
Can I help you?
Uh, excuse me.
Did you ever see such a face?
That's a face?
It must be.
He's talking out of it.
That's the first time I ever saw a ready-made victim.
Uh, tell me something, sir.
How would you like to get in on a great moneymaking career?
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen, but, you see, I've already taken a course in hotel management.
No, it's nothing like that.
I'm J.R. Finlater, and this is my associate, Alfred Swanson.
And have we got a deal for you.
Herman, you're going to be a what?
You heard me, Lily.
I'm gonna be an actor and a star in a million-dollar epic.
Herman, two men from Hollywood happened to come along and discover you while you were working on your differential?
Well, they said Lana Turner was discovered exactly the same way, only she was sitting on a stool in a drugstore.
One of them's a writer, and one of them's a producer.
That's just where I've been now.
They asked me to their office, and I signed a contract, and they start shooting me tomorrow.
- Shooting you?
- Lily, that's a show business expression, like "Roll 'em," "Lights, '" "Action, '" "Anchors away, '" that kind of stuff.
Well, darling, this is such a surprise.
I know you've got the looks and the personality, but you've never had any training.
Well, Lily, they explained that it's a documentary, like Naked City.
What they're after is stark realism.
And they said I was as stark as anything they've ever seen.
Herman, oh, this is this is wonderful.
You, a movie star!
Yes.
And, Lily, I'm doing it all for my family.
We're gonna move to Hollywood, to a nice, expensive house in Beverly Hills.
And you'll have diamonds, and Eddie will go to a private school where they'll spoil him rotten.
And, Grandpa, you can fly back and forth to the Old Country.
I do that all the time, anyway.
No, but I mean in an airplane, and first-class.
That might not be bad for a change, to see how the other half flies.
Oh, my son-in-law, the movie star.
Herman, where's that contract?
You better have me look it over.
They're keeping it for me down there on file.
And there's no need to worry.
I looked it over very quickly before I signed it.
And it's got everything in it, including double indemnity.
Double indemnity?
What's that doing in a contract?
Well, they explained that's the title of the picture.
It's a remake, and I'm doing the old Fred MacMurray part.
Oh, dear.
Herman, if you have to kiss your leading lady, I'll just die.
Oh, don't put yourself out, dear.
But if it bothers you, I'll have them use doubles for all that mushy stuff.
Uh, when does this great epic start, uh, shooting?
First thing tomorrow morning on the corner of Mockingbird Lane and Maple Drive.
Oh!
How thrilling.
We'll all be down to watch you.
Oh, no, you don't.
Uh, not tomorrow morning.
You see, they're shooting the big scene.
They're shooting the end of the picture.
They shoot the end of the picture first?
Oh, they always do.
And I know it's the end because as I was leaving the office, I heard the producer say to the writer, "Tomorrow will really be the finish for him".
Would you run through the scene just once more, Mr.J.R.?
Why, certainly.
Now, this is the climax of the picture.
Now, you, as the hero, are on your way to meet the girl, when, suddenly, you step off the curb and, whammo!
You are struck down by a speeding car.
Couldn't that be a little dangerous?
Yeah, well, it don't actually hit you.
It kind of swerves and misses you at the last minute.
Gotcha.
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Excuse me, but where's the camera?
Oh, uh, the camera.
Well, uh, I'll tell you, Munster.
For the sake of realism, we've got the camera hidden in that mail truck over there.
Very clever.
Get ready, Alfred!
Just one more question.
Why is your writer driving the car that's almost gonna hit me?
My writer?
Uh, well, because not only is Alfred another Tennessee Williams, but he also happens to be the greatest stunt driver in Hollywood.
Well, that's nice.
Okay, Alfred!
J.R.?
Yeah, what is it now?
Well, you forgot to yell, "Roll 'em," and all that kind of stuff.
We can't forget that, can we?
I forgot to say "Roll 'em".
Let's go again, Alfred!
Roll 'em!
You know something,J.R.?
What, Munster?
If he doesn't write any better than he drives, we're in big trouble.
May I have my tea now, Aunt Lily?
In a minute, Marilyn, as soon as the whistling teakettle boils.
There we are.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, by the way, Herman phoned.
He said they're gonna shoot the movie in a vacant alley this afternoon.
They ran into some kind of trouble on the street.
It'll be neat, having a father who's a real movie star.
It's a very colorful profession, Eddie.
When I was younger in the Old Country, I used to hang around the stage door and put the bite on all the actors.
You borrowed money from them?
No, I put the bite on 'em.
I bet Herman'll be tired and hungry when he gets home.
I think I'll put a little something out on the table for him to nibble on.
He just loves his little snacks.
Now, Herman, in this scene, you're leaning against the building right over here.
You're reading this newspaper, and you're waiting for your sweetheart.
I see.
Uh Oh.
Right on this chalk mark.
Right.
That's it.
Ah-ah, not quite so far.
A little bit to the left, Herman.
A little bit more.
That's the idea.
That's good.
That's fine, Hermie.
Just like that.
Perfect.
Yeah, that's great.
Oh.
Excuse me, Mr.J.R., but where's the camera this time?
Oh, uh, the camera?
Oh, uh, you see that ice cream truck over there?
Hmm?
Here.
Over here.
- Oh, yes.
- It's hidden inside.
Good thinking.
But,J.R., it occurred to me that the camera Look, Herman, why're you making a big thing out of it?
All you have to do is stand right here on the chalk mark and don't do nothin' till I yell, "Action"!
- Well, what about "Roll 'em"?
- "Action"!
I never realized how hard moving pictures were on producers and writers.
Hmm.
Herman, the first day of shooting, and they're shutting down the picture already?
I hope they haven't called it off.
You said you were gonna be a movie star, and I've been out all afternoon pricing mink shrouds.
Yeah, and I've been practicing to be a precocious little brat, so I'll be ready when I move to Hollywood.
Now, listen, everybody.
Just calm down.
They said it was just a temporary postponement till the producer gets out of the hospital.
He's got a concussion.
They said it was one of those temporary little delays that happen all the time in Hollywood.
Well, I'm glad everything's gonna be all right.
Oh, Herman, I just can't wait to see your face on a wide screen, The audiences' eyes will just pop out.
Oh, I think it's gonna be an excellent picture.
J.R. Told me they're working on a new ending for tomorrow that's gonna be a killer.
How does it look,J.R.?
Great, Alfred.
Now, all we have to do is to get Munster to go through that door, and then it's one, two, three, instant double indemnity.
I just hope he don't land on somebody and get us a counterclaim.
Stop worrying, will you?
We'll be at that claims office, collecting on a policy before he even hits the ground.
Uh Uh, close the door.
I can't stand heights.
I just told Spot about moving to Hollywood, and he's real excited.
Oh, good!
Hey, Spot, how would you like to meet Lassie?
How would you like to meet Ed, the talking horse?
Hey, uh, Spot, would you like to meet Carroll Baker?
Oh, Grandpa, stop that.
Spot was never that way till you let him eat that copy of The Carpetbaggers.
Good morning, all.
Ooh.
!
Herman, you're magnificent!
You look so glamorous.
Pop, you're a gas!
Please, fans, no autographs.
The Method Actor?
One must dig deep to come up with the right character.
You're telling me.
That's how I found my first 10 wives.
Well, I must be going.
Good-bye, dear.
We're shooting interiors today.
I'll try to give you a blast on the horn between takes.
This is the most exciting thing that ever happened you in pictures.
Lily, dear, tut, tut, tut, tut.
When one has talent, one must take these things in stride.
Bye, all.
Now, Munster, this is the most crucial scene of the whole picture, although it's a simple one.
Simple?
Right.
Now, when we open up, you're seated at the desk.
I'm seated.
Right.
When I give you the cue, you get up, run across the room, fling open that door marked "private" and step inside.
I think I get it.
I get up, go across the room, fling open that door and step inside.
Right.
Just a minute now, and I'll check the set.
All set.
All set?
Uh, no.
No?
No?
No.
What's the motivation?
Alfred, give him the motivation.
Uh, uh, me?
Uh, uh Oh.
Uh, well Well, you see, you're working here at the office, see, and it's, uh it's late at night.
And then suddenly from the other room you hear a scream.
It's your sweetheart.
You jump up, and you run to the door, and you say, "I'm coming, darling"!
And you dash inside.
All right.
Shall we Shall we make it?
Uh, no.
No?
No.
As they say in Hollywood, it just doesn't grab me.
It's right here, Lily another article about that accident ring.
Good heavens, Grandpa!
It says, "They pose as movie producers "to lure their victims into accidents.
Then they collect the insurance".
And that big dummy Herman signed a contract with double indemnity.
Now they're gonna wreck him and collect on the accident.
Oh, my poor Herman!
They'll hurt my sweet baby.
What'll we do?
I can't let anything happen to him.
Who's gonna support me in my old age?
Oh, this is terrible.
Don't panic, Spot.
Turn down your burner.
Give us a chance to think.
We've gotta keep cool.
The thing to do is call the police.
Oh, come on, Grandpa.
Let's.
Well, what's the matter?
I forgot where the phone is.
Oh, Grandpa!
Now, look, Munster.
I rewrote the whole scene for you.
Will you listen to it?
Shoot.
This is the office of the boss of the syndicate.
Right.
Now, it's late at night.
Yeah?
And you're going through the desk, looking for the papers that'll save the United States from being blown to bits.
Huh.
Now, suddenly, from the next room, you hear a scream.
Uh, but it's not my sweetheart again.
What sweetheart?
It's It's your mother.
Yeah.
Mother?
Yeah, your mother that you haven't seen in 26 years.
I think it might be a little too cliché.
Well, y-y-you didn't let me finish.
You see, because after the scream, you hear a bark.
Bark?
Yeah, a bark woof, woof!
Because tied up in there with your mother is the collie dog that pulled you out of the well when you was a little bitty boy in Scotland.
Now you're talking motivation.
All right now!
Then let's make a take.
What do you say?
Right.
Right.
There we go.
All right.
Sit down in the seat.
That's the idea.
Ready.
A Action!
Start going through the drawers.
Now you hear your mother scream.
And the dog bark!
Woof, woof!
- Now what's the matter?
- We left the camera in the ice cream truck.
No, no!
That's right, Officer.
And now they're gonna stage an accident and collect on his insurance.
Tell them to hurry, Grandpa.
They may be doing away with Herman at this very moment.
He says, unless someone stole our bicycle, he can't help us.
Oh!
He's giving me another department.
Now, look, Munster.
Everything is all set.
Now, pay attention.
Here.
The camera is behind this picture.
All right?
Your mother and the dog are in the other room.
Now, let's make a take, huh, for the final and last time?
You ready?
Uh Ready.
All right.
Action!
Now you hear your mother scream.
Aaah!
Woof, woof.
Coming, Mother!
Here!
Here!
Here.
!
You're in the closet!
Look, it's not this door.
It's this door!
A baby can do it, it's so simple!
All you do is you go to this door, open the door and step inside!
Say, uh, uh, there's no mother in there, or a dog or anything.
Uh, there's not even a room in there.
They must've moved it.
I think you fellows are trying to hurt me.
You know, if you keep this up, I might get very angry.
I might even report you to the Better Business Bureau.
Mm, so there.
So you see, Herman, they were trying to injure you to collect on the policy you signed.
You know, Lily, there oughta be a law against things like this.
Law?
Of course there's a law.
And as law-abiding citizens, we are gonna go to the police station and file a complaint against these crooks.
Herman, you had us so worried.
One of these days, you'll put us all in an early grave.
Isn't that just like Lily?
Always looking at the bright side of things.
And let's be thankful we've seen the last of these men.
Yeah,J.R., I think the big goon finally got wise to us.
Our next move is to get out of town.
Yeah?
But first we're gonna make a little call on our friend Herman Munster and put him on permanent suspension in that big movie studio in the sky.
Gee, what a creepy place.
Looks like rigor mortis set in.
Yeah, and it's about to set in on Mr. Herman Munster.
Open the door.
Why me?
Open the door!
He must be upstairs.
Call him.
We'll take care of him.
Mr. Munster.
Herman, baby.
Come on down.
We got something for ya.
Did you hear that?
I think something frightened Spot.
Boy, Spot must've been really shook up.
He burned all the paint off the door.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Oh, tidying up, Lily?
I'm trying to, Grandpa.
We must tell Eddie not to let Spot play with his ball in the house.
Where are Eddie and Herman?
Herman took Eddie over to the park to play a little baseball.
Oh, it's so nice to see a father and son so close.
Yes, Lily.
My father and I were very close.
And he used to give me such wonderful advice.
I remember one day, he said to me, "Son, as you go through life, always bury your mistakes".
Bury your mistakes?
Yes.
You see, my father never believed in divorce.
Now, Eddie, to throw a curve ball, you get two fingers around the top of the ball like this.
And then you squeeze down to get a nice firm grip.
Fiddlesticks!
Um, uh, uh, give me another ball, Eddie.
Okay, but just hit a few flies.
All right.
But I've shown you this before, Eddie.
Now watch closely.
Now, you get a nice open stance.
Feet planted firmly on the ground.
Nice firm grip on the bat.
Take it back nice and easy.
'Cause in baseball, there's a wrong way and a right way.
Uh, that's not the right way.
Now watch this.
Uh, throw me another one, Eddie.
But that was my last ball.
Huh?
Well, short baseball season, wasn't it?
Mr. Durocher, you really feel the Dodgers will win in the first division this year?
First division?
Look, Charlie, if we can come up with a power hitter I mean, a guy who can hit the long ball I think my old club is a cinch to win the pennant.
I've been beating the bushes looking for a guy Mr. Durocher!
Leo!
Are you all right?
Yeah, uh I'm all right, but how close is the nearest ballpark around here?
It's eight blocks away.
But your head.
Shall I call an ambulance?
Never mind the ambulance.
Where's the guy who hit this ball?
That's right, Walt.
This guy hit a ball at least seven blocks.
How do I know?
It conked me right on the head.
Sure, it hurt, but what's a fractured skull if it's good for baseball?
I was tipped off about this guy from some of the kids around the neighborhood.
His name is a Mr. Herman Munster and he lives on Mockingbird Lane.
Don't worry about it, Walt.
I'll have his name on the contract first thing in the morning.
Oh, is this Munster character gonna be swept right off his feet with the most sincere, lovable, charming personality What do you mean, "Who am I sending"?
I'm going myself!
Ah!
Oh, my!
Doesn't that look yummy.
How was your morning at the ballpark, Eddie?
It was real crowded when we got there.
By the time Pop got up to bat, it thinned out.
Say, Herman.
Your boss, Mr. Gateman, phoned and mentioned how busy you are.
Things really must be jumping down at the parlor.
Oh, no, they're not.
We keep a very tight lid on everything.
But we are busy.
As a matter of fact, I've brought home a lot of paperwork to do over the weekend.
- You really love your work, don't you, Uncle Herman?
- Yes, Marilyn.
Nothing could drag me away from my job down at the parlor.
That's right, Herman.
And in just 12 years, the company will give you a big banquet and a gold shovel.
Kind of grabs you, doesn't it?
Boy, I gotta love baseball to go through this.
Good evening, sir.
May I help you?
Yes.
Is this the Munster residence?
That's right.
I'm Leo Durocher, and I'd like to see a Herman Munster.
Oh, yes.
Won't you come in?
Yes.
I've never seen a place like this in my whole life.
Not even in Brooklyn.
Thank you.
My Uncle Herman has some work to do right now, but you can talk to my Aunt Lily if you like.
Fine.
Aunt Lily?
Aunt Lily, I'd like you to meet Mr. Leo Durocher.
He'd like to talk to Uncle Herman.
- Oh, how do you do, sir?
- How do you do?
I'd like to talk to your husband on business.
I'm sure he'd be glad to arrange everything in advance for you.
It's always nice to know where you're going before you go.
Well, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm in baseball.
Oh, I see.
Well, my husband's busy, but perhaps you could talk to my father first.
I'll call him.
Grandpa!
Grandpa!
Did you call, Lily?
Grandpa, this is Mr. Dur Mr. Durocher?
Mr. Durocher?
Oh.
Leo Durocher!
You could have knocked me over with a tombstone.
How do you do?
It's a pleasure.
You're one of the greatest sports figures in the last 100 years.
Thanks, but I'm not that old.
I guess it won't hurt to disturb Herman.
Marilyn, would you call him?
Oh, well, certainly, Aunt Lily.
Uncle Herman, there's someone up here to see you!
Ya big dummy!
Look what ya did.
That's Leo Durocher.
You scared him.
Me?
In that black suit, he must have thought you were an umpire.
Leo?
Leo?
Wake up.
Wake up!
I hope he's all right.
I don't like the way the color's coming back into his face.
He was safe by a mile!
Don't tell me!
- Oh.
- Take it easy, Mr. Durocher.
You're among friends.
You gotta be kiddin'.
No, no, Mr. Durocher.
This is my son-in-law, Herman Munster, the one you came to see.
Were you at the park this morning hitting some baseballs?
That's right.
I was knocking out a couple for my boy.
One of'em hit me on the head eight blocks away.
Oh, you poor man.
That explains why you acted so strangely when you came in.
Listen, Mr. Durocher, if you plan to sue, I can dig up 50 witnesses to prove we never left Transylvania.
No, no, no.
I have a business proposition for Mr. Munster.
And I wonder if I could talk to you alone.
Certainly.
Uh, would you excuse us?
Of course, dear.
In case you need me, Herman, just give me a howl.
I wonder what the business proposition is, Aunt Lily.
I don't know, but the last time a man talked to Herman alone, he wound up buying a secondhand Edsel.
Say, uh, Herman, have you ever played baseball before?
Uh, baseball?
Yeah.
Well, I've, uh I've fooled around a little with the game.
I, uh, played a little second base.
Well, I can see that's where you made your mistake.
Hmm?
Well, you know when that runner's on first coming down into second base to break up the double play?
You've gotta keep your face outta the way of those spikes.
Oh, right.
I'll try to remember that.
Uh-huh.
I'll say one thing, boy.
You're really built.
You're put together like a ballplayer.
Oh.
Well, thank you.
That wasn't the plan.
I just came out that way.
Herman?
Hmm?
Does Mr. Durocher really think you could be a big baseball player?
That's right, Lily.
I'm going down to the baseball park this morning and try out.
He says I've got it in the bag.
Oh, boy, my dad playing for the Dodgers.
Wait till I tell the other kids.
You know, that's great, Herman.
There's big money in baseball.
Oh, it's not just the money, Grandpa.
What I'm looking forward to is the fringe benefits.
I'll be able to endorse breakfast foods and shave on television.
And I'll be able to sit in the audience on the Ed Sullivan Show and have him mispronounce my name and everything.
But, Uncle Herman, what about your job at the parlor and your career?
Yes, Herman.
Mr. Gateman has great plans for you down there.
And he's so proud of you, and the way you carry your share of the load.
That's true, dear.
Uh, that's very true.
But right now, Herman Munster is at the crossroads.
Should I struggle along at an old job for the promise of security in the future?
Or should I grasp time by the forelock, and, on that great merry-go-round of life, try for the brass ring?
Translation the big ham thinks he can play baseball.
You can scoff if you wanna, Grandpa, but when I go down to that ballpark this morning, it's gonna be one, two, three strikes, you're out.
Hello?
Mr. Gateman?
This is Mrs. Herman Munster.
How are you?
Oh, good.
Oh, yes, I'm fine.
Thank you.
Enjoying perfect health.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to get your day off to a bad start.
I'm calling for my husband, Herman.
He won't be able to get into the parlor today for work.
No, no, he's not sick.
He has an appointment downtown with a Mr. Leo Durocher.
No, Mr. Durocher's not sick either.
But Herman will be glad to give him one of your cards.
Yes.
Yes, I hope I hope Herman will be able to come in tomorrow.
Good-bye.
Oh!
Please give Mrs. Gateman my regards.
The last time I saw her she looked so natural.
Hey, Leo.
Where's this great prospect you were telling me about?
He's in the clubhouse getting his uniform on.
He'll be right out.
Hey, what's he like?
Well, he's no matinee idol.
You know, it's the whole family, it's a weird setup.
They all look like a bunch of wetbacks from the Petrified Forest.
Boy, Pop, you sure look neat in that new outfit.
Oh, thank you, son.
Oh, boy.
Your old man's gonna be a big-league star.
Take it easy, Pop.
The other guys will think you're a crackup.
- Good morning, Mr. Durocher.
- Hiya, Herm.
Who is What is this?
Uh, this is my son.
Edward Wolfgang Munster.
Oh.
I can see the family resemblance.
How do you do?
It's very nice of you to give my father this wonderful opportunity.
Oh, that's nothing.
It's fine.
I want you to meet a friend of mine, Charlie Hodges, a reporter.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Mr. Munster?
Come on, Herman.
Hold it, Bill.
You've had enough for a while.
Let Herman here.
Herman, grab a bat there and let's see you hit a couple.
Well, I'll give it the old school try.
Good morning.
Hi.
Uh, oops-a-daisy.
Well, don't worry about that, Herman.
It happens to the best of them.
Here, try this one.
Thank you.
Uh, time!
What's the matter?
Where do you want it?
Where do I want it?
Why don't you try and hit it over the center field fence.
Got you.
That-a-boy, Pop!
I don't believe it!
Hit a grounder, Pop.
!
Bingo!
I never saw anything like it.
I don't know whether to sign him with the Dodgers or send him to Vietnam.
Grandpa, lunch.
What are we having?
Bird's nest soup.
It's my favorite.
Well, I can always scramble an egg.
Lily, I wanna show you this new baseball I invented in my lab.
Oh, Grandpa, I don't wanna hear anything about baseball.
But, Lily, you've gotta see this.
This automatically makes every pitch a curve.
Now, watch this here.
You ready?
Ooh!
Well, I ask you, is that a curve or is that a curve?
I think this whole thing is ridiculous.
Imagine Herman, a grown man of 150 years old playing baseball with young men of 55 and 60.
Hey, Herman.
Excuse me, Mr. Durocher.
I'm signing autographs for my fans.
Hey, Dad, this guy wants one for Don Drysdale.
There you go.
All right, Leo, I'll admit he's the greatest hitter I've ever seen, but what if he's all hit and no field?
Well, I've been thinking of that, and I'll check on it right now.
Let's break it up, fellas.
Come on.
Let's play ball.
Here you go.
Let me have that glove.
Herman, let's see how you play center field.
Huh?
How are you with flies?
Well, to tell you the truth, they bother me a little in the hot weather.
I mean catching flies!
Oh!
Oh.
Uh, don't you worry, Mr. Durocher.
I'll be right on the ball.
Oh, here.
Go ahead out there.
Go ahead.
Oh.
Hey, will you hit a few fly balls to Herman in center field?
He's gonna run into the fence!
I knew it was too good to last.
That-a-boy, Pop!
Did you see that?
Now they tell me you can play second base.
I saw you in center field.
All right, now there's a man on first base.
There's one out.
The batter's gonna hit the ball to you.
I want you to step on second base, then relay the ball to first base to complete the double play, okay?
Gotcha.
Yeah, but wait a minute.
That runner on first base is gonna try to knock you down or knock you over to take you out of the play.
So be alive.
Gotcha.
Oh Okay, gang, let's talk it up out here!
Let's get the old pepper goin'!
Take him out of there now, Jim.
Knock him down if you can.
- Uh, what do I do now?
- Throw it home!
No, no, no.
!
Hold it.
!
No, no, no.
I quit, Leo.
No.
!
I'm going back to the minors.
Uh, here you go.
No.
!
Darn, Mr. Durocher!
Nobody wants to play with me!
Darn, darn, darn, darn!
Oh, I knew it.
Lily!
Lily!
Marilyn!
Look, look!
Look, it's right here in the afternoon paper.
Look at this.
"Durocher keeps mystery prospect under wraps.
"Tryout reported held today with Herman Munster.
Said to be the greatest long-ball hitter in the history of the game"!
Oh, boy!
Herman's got it made!
We'll all be rich!
Oh!
Well, why are you so against it, Aunt Lily?
Well, for one thing, I wouldn't want my sweet pussycat to be a star and get a big head.
But, Lily, you can't hold him back.
He's no longer plain Herman Munster.
Your pussycat now belongs to the world.
Herman!
Herman, congratulations.
Where's the contract, huh?
When do you start?
How 'bout spring training?
Does it start early, huh?
I don't have a contract.
What?
I don't start anywhere.
What?
They don't want me.
We almost made it.
Pop was signing autographs for Don Drysdale and everything.
Then Mr. Durocher made a phone call and told us to go home.
Well, what happened, Uncle Herman?
Well, Mr. Durocher called Mr. O'Malley of the Dodgers and told him what I did, and then he hung up with a long look on his face.
Yeah, he said the way Pop batted the ball around and knocked over the scoreboard and everything, he'd ruin the field.
Mr. O'Malley said it would cost him $75,000 to put the Dodger Stadium back in shape every time I played.
Ooh, what a catastrophe!
And they said the insurance companies wouldn't allow the players on the same field with me.
Herman, I didn't want you to do it, but just the same, I know how badly you must feel.
You know, Lily, I'm all washed up in sports.
I'm a has-been.
Oh, don't worry, Pop.
You can always play baseball with me in the park.
- Thank you, Eddie.
- Yes, Uncle Herman.
And I need you around to help me do my homework.
- Thank you, Marilyn.
- And, Herman, don't feel badly on my account.
So I won't make a million dollars sponging off you.
I can learn to live with it.
Thank you, Grandpa.
That's very touching.
Herman, you must realize how much we all love you and need you, each in our own way.
And I, most of all.
Thank you, Lily.
Now look what you've gone and made me do.
I haven't cried like this since they canceled Kukla, Fran and Ollie.
Grandpa, are you down here?
I'm in here watching television.
!
Where's Herman and Eddie?
They went to the park.
Oh, not baseball again.
No, I think they took the football with them this time.
Herman's always been great at sports.
Remember back in Transylvania when he was a cross-country runner?
Oh, he had quite a following.
Crowds used to run after him yelling and screaming.
What are you watching?
It's a cooking show.
They're gonna give a recipe for an upside-down cake.
Uh, 6, 23, uh, uh, uh, 11, 12.
Hup!
Thanks very much for the lunch.
It was very enjoyable, Charlie.
Elroy, as general manager of the Rams, I suppose you look forward to a real top season.
Yes, I think we're strong in every department.
But I'm a little worried about our punting.
I got you.
Elroy, are you all right?
Yeah, I'm all right, but tell me, is there a football field around here?
No.
The closest one is eight blocks away.
Eight blocks?
I think I might have the answer to our kicking problem.
Mr. Hirsch.
!
Take my advice.
Forget it if you don't wanna wind up going out of your skull.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
And our fourth-prize winner here in our local contest is BessieJune Rassmussen of Apple Valley.
Hmph.
I knew it wouldn't be me.

The only thing I ever won were those free facials down at Antoine's.
Our third-prize winner is HarryJerome of 16 Maple Drive.
HarryJerome.
Why don't you tell everybody he's the sponsor's nephew!

And for our second prize, our second-prize winner is Wilma Winninger of 477 Hesby Avenue.
Hesby Avenue?
T-That's clear across town.
Politics!
Politics!

And our first-prize winner goes to a lucky person right here in Mockingbird Heights.
It's worth $5,000.
And the first-prize winner is Mr. Herman Go ahead and say it.
Mr. Herman Overholtzer.
Mr. Herman Flork.
- Mr. Herman Munster.
- Graft!
Graft!
Graft!
You hear me?
G Wait a minute.
It's me!
It's me!
It's me!
I'm Herman Munster!
I'm Hi!
I'm Herman Munster!
I won a prize worth $5,000!
Lily, Grandpa!
Everybody come in quick!
What's the matter?
What's up, Herman?
What is it?
The contest on TV!
I won!
I won!
I won!
I won!
I won!
I won!
I won!
I won!
Where are you going, Grandpa?
Where am I going?
Down in the dungeon.
I wanna find out what Herman's talking about.
He'll be there any minute.
Uncle Herman, you can't keep us in suspense any longer.
Come on, Pop.
Tell us about the neat prize you won.
All right.
All right.
All right.
The Munsters mind you, the entire family has won a membership to the Mockingbird Heights Country Club.
Whoopee!
Oh, that club is so exclusive.
Why, you know you have to wait for one of the members to pass away before you can even be considered for membership.
I know.
That's what's so wonderful.
Once we're in, we can stay forever.
As far as I can recall, no member of my family ever passed away for good.
You know something, I think I'm gonna take up golf.
Only I'm not sure about being out in the sun too much.
I'd hate to lose my parlor pallor.
You know, Lily, I'm going to love it.
It's gonna give me a chance to mingle with some real blue bloods.
Well, Grandpa, if you do, just don't put the bite on them right off the bat.
I have a letter here from the local television station.
They have a winner for that club membership we donated.
I was against that from the beginning.
This is an exclusive club and awarding a membership through a contest is very undignified.
I'm sorry, Petrie, but I'm inclined to agree with Reggie.
A thing like this can give us a more popular image with the community.
I'll go along with it because I seem to be outnumbered.
But who are these contest winners?
It's a Mr. And Mrs. Herman Munster and family of Mockingbird Lane.
Well, we have a luncheon and fashion show coming up this week.
We can invite Mrs. Munster to that and send Munster a guest card to play golf.
That way, we can get a close look at them see if they measure up to our standards.
You know, Grandpa?
I bet it would even shake up Arnold Palmer to see me on the putting green.
You're good all right, Herman.
You know the last time I saw a swing like that was when they hung my Uncle George.
Herman!
Grandpa!
Uh, Lily.
Lily, dear.
Please.
I'm shooting.
Herman, guess what the mailman just dropped and ran?
My new Bugs Bunny cartoon book?
It's a letter from the Mockingbird Heights Country Club.
They're inviting me to a luncheon, and they sent you a guest card to play golf.
Oh.
You know, Lily, that's a very good idea.
It'll give us a chance to look over the club and see if the people measure up to our standards.
We'll have to dress to the occasion.
Um, I think I'll wear my new Transylvanian original.
You know, the one with the-the lovely shroud.
Old Hermie, the pro.
Fore!
Grandpa, where did the ball go?
What do you know about that?
A hole in one.
From the turnout today, I think this is going to be our most successful luncheon.
Two of the Munsters have accepted our invitation, so this will give us a good chance to look them over.
I'm still not sold on this idea of awarding a membership through a contest.
It's the duty of this committee to see to it that only the right sort of people are admitted to the club.
Excuse me, where are they having the luncheon?
- It's in the main grill.
- Thank you.
And that's another area this committee should take up.
Every time Charley Hinshaw gets a snootful, he dresses up in those ridiculous outfits.
That was the wildest one yet.
Lily, the man said that the luncheon is in the grill room.
Grandpa, this place is depressingly cheerful.
But I suppose this modern decor is what they go in for.
My the people are friendly here.
She told a perfect stranger where she got her dress and how much it cost.
Yes, b-but I don't care for that style.
I wouldn't want you to be seen dead in a dress like that.
You're right, Grandpa.
I'll make a point not to.
Never mind, Lily.
Shall we, uh, have a libation?
Hi, folks.
A little early for a masquerade party, isn't it?
Sure is.
Oh, you club people are so jolly.
This is simple chiffon from the Paris Collection, 129.95.
Now that dress is more like it.
When I used to fly around in the Old Country, I always found a high neckline a challenge.
I think it's sweet the way the women around here confide in each other.
I think I'll float around a bit and get acquainted.
This is simple chiffon from the Paris Collection, 129.95.
This ensemble has a cape made of tufted coffin lining in a lovely shade of cemetery green.
This little number was very inexpensive.
The fabric is made of black widow's webs.
And the underslip, pure, unborn centipede.
Now, my friend, this is all very simple.
I'll show it to you again.
Now all you have to do is guess under which nut the spider is hiding.
Of course, if you don't guess the first time Grandpa, I showed the ladies my dress and Oh, good, you're showing the bartender the shell game.
Don't win too much, Grandpa.
Hey, that's not Charley Hinshaw.
Who are those people?
Those are the Munsters.
Good heavens!
He's gambling with the bartender.
She's gotten herself so stoned, she's joining the fashion show.
You still want those contest winners in our club?
Petrie, I'm afraid I'll have to agree with you.
But I'll tell you something, when that Mr. Munster shows up to play golf, if he doesn't turn out to be our idea of a human being, I'll throw them out personally.
Aunt Lily, do you mean the people were actually rude to you at the country club?
Yes.
When we first went in, everything was fine.
But, suddenly, I had a feeling we weren't wanted.
That's right, Marilyn.
There I was playing my shell game with the bartender, when all of a sudden, some guy in a dark suit came by, scooped up my shells and led me outside.
He said they-they didn't allow nuts in the club.
It must be some kind of a rule of the department of agriculture.
I was going around showing off my dress, when one woman came up to me and said, "Why don't you go home and sleep it off, dearie".
I tell you, Marilyn.
We might just as well face it.
Those people at the country club are just not our kind of people.
Oh, what a shame.
If Uncle Herman went down there and got insulted why, he's so sensitive, he'd go all to pieces inside.
Oh, that would never do.
The last time that happened, he rattled for a week.
I guess we'll just have to tell Herman that it won't work out.
That we don't want to join a club like that.
We're home from the golf store.
Yoo-hoo!
We're home.
Well, how do you like it?
The man at the store said this is what Ken Venturi wore when he won the National Open.
We're going to play tomorrow, and I'm going to caddy.
I bet everybody will follow us all over the course.
Oh boy, now I know how the Prince of Wales used to feel.
That's fine, Prince.
You better start feeling like a peasant again.
Hmm?
Grandpa.
What's he talking about?
Uh, well, Herman, um, what would you say if we, uh well, if we decided not to join the country club?
Not join?
What do you mean "not join"?
Lily, I won that membership fair and square, and if I didn't join the club, it would crush my spirit.
And I don't want my spirit crushed.
Oh.
But I was thinking that I'd probably scare the boys away just as much at the country club as I do here.
- So I don't care if we join or not.
- You don't?
- No.
- And I'd probably get to like the luncheons and the teas and the cocktail parties, and I'd start coming home late and serving you TV dinners and neglecting my family.
You know, all those little niceties that are part of country club living.
A-And Herman, I don't wanna join the club because there's no one there of my class.
After all, Herman, you know I'm a full-blooded count.
And the closest thing they have to royalty there is the bartender, "Duke" Fineberg.
You know, I've suddenly realized something.
You do?
Yes.
You know what you've made me realize?
What?
That you don't give a hoot what I want.
What does a man work for all his life?
A little feeling of respectability and-and success.
Well, that's what joining the club would give me.
And that's what I want and I'm gonna have it.
You hear me?
That's what I want and I'm gonna have it!
I'm gonna have it!
I'm gonna have it!
I'm gonna have it!
I'm gonna have it!
Excuse me, Lily, while I continue this conversation with Herman in the dungeon.
"Dear Lily, Eddie and I have gone to the country club.
Will play a round of golf before work.
Signed, Arnie Munster".
Look at the time.
It's 5:30 a.m. Half the day is gone.
That course will probably be jammed.
Oh, dear.
I just hate the thought of all those rude people staring at Uncle Herman when he tees off.
"Par five, 580 yards".
Hmm.
Short one.
Pop?
Hmm?
Do you wanna pick a club?
Oh.
Good idea, son.
Uh, eenie-meenie-minie-mo.
What am I doing?
Eight's my lucky number.
Eight iron, caddy.
There you are.
Thank you.
Oh.
Now isn't that nice of'em.
They left us two practice balls.
Now, the first thing you do, Eddie, is to address the ball.
Hello, ball.
That's a joke, Eddie.
Oh.
Sorry.
Now, Eddie, the hole's right down there.
Keep your eye on the ball like a good caddy.
Hmm.
You know, those practice balls are nice and big, but they're made very badly.
Give me one of our small ones.
Thank you, son.
Now.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Hey, Dad?
Hmm?
It's in the rough.
Darn!
On the third hole,  I think you overclubbed yourself.
I think you're right.
But, as they say in golf, Eddie, you gotta play 'em where you hit 'em.
Yeah.
Come on.
We'll ride down to the ball.
Okay.
Why do they call it the rough, Pop?
That's one of the reasons.
I think I made the trap.
Come on, Eddie.
Hit it, Pop.
!
Hit it.
!
Now, Eddie, this is a very important shot.
Getting out of the sand.
Now watch closely.
Watch the sand.
Watch the sand, Pop.
Eddie!
Eddie!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I'm out and I'm pin high.
Eddie?
Eddie.
Eddie, where are you, son?
Eddie?
Pop, you made the green!
How about that?
How about that?
You know, Eddie?
I never knew golf was such a fun game.
Come on, son.
Oh.
Oopsy-daisy.
Oopsy-daisy.
Well, that's what you get when you putt against the wind.
Just as I thought.
I've been putting against the grain.
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
I made it!
Come on, Pop.
Let's go to the next tee.
Be right with you, Eddie.
Come on, Pop.
I got your ball.
I'm coming, Eddie.
What a great game!
And to think, when I'm a member, I'll be doing this every day.
I just hope those rude people didn't embarrass Herman when he tried to play golf this morning.
Lily, there's no two ways about it.
That country club is just not for us.
When Herman gets home from work, I'm sure he'll tell us he's decided the same thing.
And we all thought it was so great when he won that contest.
Hi, everybody.
Hello, dear.
Sweetie, about the country club Lily, please don't mention that country club.
It's just too sad to think about.
You're right, Herman.
Grandpa!
Read the afternoon paper.
"Fiend desecrates golf course in early morning.
"Inhuman footprints were found this morning on putting greens at the Mockingbird Heights Country Club.
"Enormous gouges taken from turf and course flooded.
Greenskeeper is in a state of shock".
- Herman, what does this mean?
- What does it mean?
It means that we are not gonna join the country club.
I will not jeopardize the safety of my family at a country club where some madman is allowed to run loose.
That's right.
That club is just no good all-around.
My letter of disapproval is already in the mail.
I've turned down that membership I won.
It's a shame we have to forfeit a $5,000 prize.
Well, as far as the money's concerned, I told the club that they could use that money to repair the damage to the course caused by that madman.
It's just lucky you didn't run into that fiend this morning when you were playing there.
Lily, don't say such a thing, dear.
If I ever came face-to-face with a frightening, horrible creature like that, it'd scare me out of a hundred years' growth.
Now, Herman  Really, Herman.
After all the trouble we've had with that country club, haven't you had enough of golf?
Someday, I may find a golf club worth joining.
And it won't hurt if I keep up with my chip shots.
Grandpa?
Uh, did you see where-where the ball Oh, I'm Grandpa Herman, would you do me a favor?
Certainly, Grandpa.
Don't ever take up bowling!
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
Good day, madam.
Is your husband home?
Uh, I'm afraid he's not, sir.
Oh.
Good!
Oh!
Herman!
You're so cute.
You just give me vulture-bumps all over.
L I do have a certain built-in charm.
Lily, dear, was there any mail today?
No, but the express company delivered a box from the Old Country.
Oh.
I had them put it in here.
Oh, let's see who it's from.
Eh, it's Uncle Gilbert!
We'll-We'll have you out in a jiffy, Uncle Gilbert.
You're just in time for dinner.
No, no, Herman.
It's not Uncle Gilbert.
It's from Uncle Gilbert.
Oh, eh, sorry.
A natural mistake.
I don't know what's in it, but he sent a letter asking us to keep it for him until he gets here.
He's coming over on a visit in two or three days.
Oh!
Hey, Pop.
I've been waiting for you to get home.
You can open the crate with my genuine Transylvanian Boy Scout hatchet.
Thank you, son.
Ah!
Gold coins.
Hundreds of them!
Yippee.
!
But Uncle Gilbert isn't a rich man.
Where in the world would he get thousands of dollars out of the blue?
Well, Uncle Gilbert used to be a politician.
Maybe Transylvania was declared an unfriendly nation, and our government automatically sent them foreign aid.
And here's your receipt, Mrs. Munster.
When we learned you had such a big deposit, we were happy to send along our armored car.
I see it came to a hundred and eighty thousand dollars.
You know, those coins are pure gold and very rare.
They appear to be Spanish doubloons.
Well, you've been very helpful, Mr. Benson.
It would be a nuisance to have all that loose change kicking about the house.
Yeah.
Yes.
Everything taken care of, Aunt Lily?
Oh.
This very efficient young man has been very, very helpful.
Oh, I guess you two haven't met.
Mr. Benson, this is my niece, Marilyn.
Uh, well  I'm very glad to meet you, Miss Alan.
My first name is Benson, but you can call me Marilyn.
Oh, I'm sorry.
A hundred and eighty thousand pardons.
What I mean to say is, l I sure am delighted to meet ya.
Uh, well, bye.
Oh.
Good evening, Grandpa, Lily.
Uh, sorry I had to work late, dear, and eat downtown, but before I left the parlor, I had to lay out some work for tomorrow.
That's all right, Herman, but keep your voice down.
Hm?
Keep my voice down?
What are you doing sitting here in the kitchen?
Don't tell me Spot ate the living room furniture again!
No, don't, no.
We're sitting here because Marilyn is sitting in the living room with a young man.
That new assistant manager the bank sent over?
He fell for her like a ton of headstones.
Plain, old, drab Marilyn?
Yes, Herman.
It must be either love or astigmatism.
Lily and I are trying to make sure he doesn't get away.
Pretty soon, I'm going to sneak out and bolt the front door.
I'm going out now and see if they're sitting close together.
Lily.
Grandpa.
I do not believe we should try to push Marilyn's romance along.
We should let it take its own course.
But, Herman Uh, Grandpa.
If Marilyn's clock of romance has begun to tick, it does not behoove us to overwind her mainspring.
And the minute I saw you this morning, I wanted to know you better.
Did you want something, Aunt Lily?
I hate to disturb you two, but could I borrow that pillow?
This one, Mrs. Munster?
Yes.
I was making some chicken soup, and I ran out of feathers.
Hmm.
These'll do nicely.
Yeah.
Sure.
Oh, Mr. Benson, uh, why don't you sit over here on the sofa next to Marilyn?
It's much more comfy.
Yes.
Uh, thank you.
She makes chicken soup with feathers?
Doesn't everyone?
How's everything going?
I borrowed the pillow out of his chair, so he has to sit on the sofa next to Marilyn.
Good!
Listen, you two.
I am against promoting romance.
It will lead to no good.
We don't want it to lead to any good.
We want it to lead to marriage.
Grandpa.
What are you What are you doing?
I've got Eddie stashed away in the dungeon.
Ha-ha!
It's part of my master plan.
Come in, Eddie.
This is Grandpa.
Over.
Well, now, isn't this cozy?
You know, Marilyn, it's been a long time since I've met a girl like you, especially one whose home is so   Hey, hey.
!
Alan, what's the matter?
Oh, there's something coming up out of the floor, and it's got fangs!
Oh, that's just my little cousin, Eddie.
What is it, Eddie?
Sorry to bother you two, but one of the lightbulbs went out down in the dungeon.
Eh Thanks a lot.
Yes, Eddie?
Phase two completed.
Over and out.
Good boy.
Now they're sitting close together with the lights down low.
All we need is some soft music.
Leave it to me.
Shades ofTristan and Isolde, shoot me a love theme straight from the shoulder.
?
?
The organ, it's playing by itself!
Yes, isn't it romantic?
You hear that?
It worked.
Oh, Grandpa, you are a genius!
Oh, I must admit that you ?
?
What was that?
Something must have gone wrong.
What?
It's never done that before!
Aunt Lily!
Grandpa!
Help!
Grandpa.
!
Grandpa!
Herman!
Come on!
Not me.
You made your kettle of fish, now sleep in it.
So there!
Oh!
Down!
Down, boy!
Sit!
Stay!
Down, boy!
Hold it, hold it.
!
Down, down.
!
Stop.
!
- Alan!
Alan!
-  Whoa!
Herman, come quick!
We need your help!
Herman!
Well, don't just stand there!
Do something!
Allow me.
?
?
There.
I hope it doesn't wriggle till after sundown.
You want a little more coffee?
No, no.
That's okay.
I've stopped shaking now.
What happened?
You told me this girl was such a doll.
Oh, Marilyn is.
But that house and the aunt and the grandfather.
Boy, they're like something out of Edgar Allan Poe.
Well, I guess you'll be scratching her off your list, huh?
Gosh, no.
I can't afford to, not since I saw that solid gold deposit they made.
Ben, that girl has really got what it takes a hundred and eighty thousand dollars'worth.
I wouldn't mind saying "I do" to a balance like that, huh?
You know something, Alan?
You're really a rat.
Okay, okay.
But you'll talk nicer to me when I'm a rich rat.
Herman, frankfurters, please.
If you'll just wait, Grandpa, they'll be there in a minute.
Hey, how come Marilyn's not eating with us again tonight?
Because, Eddie, that nice young boy from the bank called her and asked her out on another date.
That's four dates this week, and he's always so anxious to be alone with her.
When she comes to the door, he won't even come into the house.
He just rushes her into the car and takes off!
What kept you?
You know, this is the first young man that's really seemed interested in Marilyn.
Wouldn't it be wonderful if he asked her to marry him?
I'm all for it, all for it.
I haven't been to a wedding since I married my 140th wife.
I hope Marilyn has as wonderful a wedding as we had, Herman.
It was so touching when that mad scientist gave you away and then presented me with a copy of your blueprints.
I know, dear.
I just hope wherever Marilyn is tonight, she's looking into a pair of eyes as romantic as mine.
There.
Does that change your mind any?
Gosh, Alan, I don't know.
An elopement sounds romantic and all that, but I hate to do things behind my family's back.
Now, wait a minute.
You say they love you and want you to be happy.
They'll get used to it.
But I think you better talk to my uncle about something as important as marriage.
He likes to do things the old-fashioned way.
It's just the way he's put together.
But that's just it.
What if he says no or tells us to wait?
We might even lose each other forever.
You wouldn't want that to happen, would you, doll?
Well, Alan, l Now, what were you saying?
Well, an elopement might not be such a bad idea after all.
Arrive New York Harbor, Friday.
Will see you on weekend.
Hope money is in safe place.
Love and kisses, Uncle Gilbert.
Thank you, Operator.
Ho-ho!
Oh, Grandpa, isn't that exciting?
Yes.
He'll be here for the weekend.
Oh-ho-ho!
Good old Gilly!
He always was a fun fellow.
Now he'll get to meet Marilyn's beau, and if there's a wedding in the family, he can stay over for it.
Yes, and if Marilyn gets to marry that Mr. Benson, I won't mind having a banker in the family.
After all, a fella who works in a vault can't be all bad.
Well, maybe we're getting our hopes too high.
After all, Marilyn is plain, and, well  I'll get it.
?
?
Yeah, hello.
It's the Munster residence.
The Count speaking.
You don't know me, sir, but I'm a friend of Alan Benson's.
I thought I should warn you about something that's going to happen tonight.
What?
Elopement?
Yes, sir, and I feel it's my duty to tell you.
He's marrying your niece for one reason that money you have in our bank.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello!
Grandpa!
What-What's this about an elopement?
That fella's marrying Marilyn for her money.
And they're gonna elope tonight!
Now let me get this straight.
This fellow, Benson, is eloping with our niece, Marilyn, tonight in order to get that hundred and eighty thousand dollars we put in the bank?
- Yes, Herman, and Grandpa and I have worked out a plan.
- I'm all ears.
Well, first of all, Marilyn is so infatuated with this boy, that if we told her the truth, she wouldn't believe it, right?
Right.
Now, the next step is to get Marilyn out of the way tonight, so she can't elope with him, right?
Right.
And then we can confront this boy with what we know.
You follow me?
Follow you?
If we were any closer, we'd be dancing.
But how do we get Marilyn out of the way?
Grandpa has a magic spell that'll transport her back to Transylvania for the night.
And then, right after we get rid of this Benson bum, I bring Marilyn back.
I got this spell right out of my magic book.
Herman, it's our only chance.
That mean Mr. Benson is going to be here at midnight to elope with Marilyn.
Come on.
Let's go upstairs and get this over with.
Sure are a lot of mean people in the world.
Why can't life be the way it is in Mary Poppins?
Aah!
Meanie!
Marilyn  Come with me and stay right over here.
Eddie, over there, Lily, right here and Herman, I'd like to have you over here.
Grandpa, what is this all about?
Marilyn, we'll explain later.
It's for your own good.
Eh, Marilyn dear, be a good girl, and humor your poor, old, decrepit grandfather.
Thank you.
Don't let time or space detain ya.
Here you go to Transylvania.
Grandpa!
L-It worked!
That was really neat!
Grandpa, you really Eh, Grandpa?
Grandpa!
Lily, where did Grandpa go?
Eh, Lily?
Lily?
Lily!
Eh, Eddie, where-where's Lily?
Eddie?
Eddie?
Where is everybody?
Hmm.
Well, wouldn't you know?
That old goofball "overspelled" himself!
They've all been transported!
Every time there's a crisis, some boob has to telephone.
Huh!
Hello?
Oh, hello, Grandpa.
Where are you?
Where am I?
I'm in the Happy Valley Motel in Kansas City.
Oh, really?
Say, how is the weather there?
Oh, it is clearing up a bit  Herman, the spell backfired.
We're all here.
I'll be darned.
When are you coming back?
Look, Herman, all I've got with me is the one-way spell.
You've gotta go down to the dungeon and get the return-trip spell out of my magic book and read it to me over the phone.
Gotcha.
Uh, be right back.
- Uh, Grandpa.
- Yes, Herman?
- Um, what was it I was supposed to get?
- The return-trip spell out of my magic book.
That's right.
Uh, don't go away.
- Eh, Grandpa, it's me.
- Herman, did you get the formula?
No.
It was dark down there, and the book snapped at me again.
Oh, brother!
Will someone please tell me what's going on here?
Yeah, Mom.
What's up?
Oh, Grandpa, give me that phone.
Take Marilyn in the other room and tell her what happened.
Some sorcerer's apprentice he is.
Well, come, my dear.
I'll break it to you gently.
Now, first of all, that fella you're in love with is a rat fink.
- Herman, are you there?
- Yes, Lily.
Now, listen, Herman.
It's almost midnight.
That Alan Benson is going to show up in 20 minutes to elope with Marilyn.
When he does, you're just going to have to be there waiting for him in her place.
Well, that's a good idea, dear, but don't you think he'll notice the difference?
Oh, Herman!
Herman, I don't want you to elope with him.
I just want you to tell him off.
I see, dear.
Tell him off.
Uh, right.
Be forceful.
Right.
Don't worry.
I'll give him a piece of my mind.
When I have to be, I can be a pretty terrifying individual.
Hmm.
He'll be here in ten minutes.
I guess I'll just turn out the light, so I don't have to look at this horrible furniture of Marilyn's.
Boy, when he comes through that window and finds me sitting here, he's really gonna think he tangled with a tiger.
Marilyn!
It's me, honey.
I've come to get ya!
How could she sleep at a time like this?
The least she could do is knock it off with the snoring.
Come on, sweetheart.
Wake up!
It's your Prince Charming who's come to take you away.
Sweetie, darling.
It's me, honey.
That's strange.
She must wear mittens to bed.
Darling, are you Ohh!
Ohh!
Uh, young man, wait!
Young man!
Young man?
Uh, young man!
Young man?
Young man.
!
Young man!
L Well, he certainly left in a hurry.
I didn't even have a chance to tell him off.
Well, I guess everyone looks kind of frightening when they first wake up.
Well, Herman, I must say, it's nice to be back home after a certain party forced us to take a plane all the way back from Kansas City.
I'm sorry, Lily.
But I at least saved you a full fare by flying back under my own power!
And I'm glad to be home too.
The truth about Alan was an awful shock, but I guess I'll get used to it.
I'm sure you will, dear.
And to think that the money that that young man was after isn't ours at all.
It belongs to Uncle Gilbert.
Hmm!
Hey, Uncle Gilbert oughta be here any minute.
Huh?
His plane got into the airport Oh!
Dear, I hope he doesn't have a hard time getting a taxi.
You know, sometimes  I'll bet that's Uncle Gilbert!
I'll get it!
That's who it is!
Herman!
Uncle Gilbert!
Come right in!
How are you?
Well, now, it certainly is good to drop in on my favorite relatives!
Oh, yes!
Hello, Uncle Gilbert!
Hi, Uncle Gilbert!
Come right in and sit down, Uncle Gilbert!
We haven't seen you in such a long time.
Come right in and sit down.
How are things going?
Swimmingly.
Oh, but say, let me get out of these dry things and into something wet.
Well, sit down, Uncle Gilbert!
Yes!
Well, Uncle Gilbert, before I forget it, all that money you sent us is safe in the bank.
Fine, fine.
But, Uncle Gilbert?
Uh, just one thing.
Uh, we were a little curious.
Where did you get all that gold?
Yeah, Uncle Gilbert.
Where'd you get all those neat Spanish doubloons and rare gold pieces?
Oh, those!
Oh, why, Eddie, my boy, that's loose change I picked up in ships and treasure chests lying around in my neighborhood.
- No foolin'!
- Sure!
That's one reason I wouldn't live anyplace else in the world.
Oh, there's a lot of advantages, my boy, to being the Creature from the Black Lagoon.
Yeah!
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
There you are, Herman!
Oh.
Who were you calling?
Oh, I was just trying to make an appointment at that new barbershop.
Well, what's wrong with your old barber?
Oh, Lily.
He-He always made me very nervous, dear, the way he'd always blindfold himself before he'd give me a shave.
Some of those temperamental hairdressers are such show-offs.
Oh, by the way, Marilyn has a project to do for her course in ancient history.
I'm going to drive her down to the county museum tonight.
Oh, uh Oh, no, you're not, dear.
I am the head of this house, and as such, I will take care of this matter.
All right.
But, uh, just drive her there and then pick her up later.
I don't want you getting in any trouble.
Lily, how could I get in any trouble at a museum?
Thatcher, this may turn out to be one of the greatest discoveries in Egyptology a perfectly preserved sarcophagus from the 18th Dynasty.
And you have reason to believe that it's never been opened?
No evidence of grave robbers, and the tomb it came from appeared to be completely undisturbed.
And you actually have hope that-that it may be occupied?
Well, we can't say one way or the other.
But if it is, this may be the most perfectly preserved mummy since King Tut.
When we open this lid at the press conference tomorrow morning, we may be face-to-face with one of the most incredible and startling sights ever seen by modern man.
Eddie, what happened to you?
Oh, I was taking Spot for a walk, and he chased a car again.
Oh, my.
Did he catch it?
No.
He just ate the rear bumper off.
Oh, dear.
He's so playful.
He'll be hiccuping all night.
Say, where's Dad?
He took Marilyn to the museum, and now he's down with Grandpa in the lab working on an experiment.
Is it anyone we know?
No, dear.
Grandpa's trying to invent some new kind of sleeping pill.
There you are, Herman.
If this pill doesn't put you to sleep, I don't know what will.
Uh But, Grandpa, I can't take a sleeping pill now.
I've got to go down and pick up Marilyn at the museum.
And you know I hate to drive when I'm asleep.
But, Herman, this is not an ordinary sleeping pill.
This is an alarm clock pill.
An alarm clock pill?
Yes.
I can set it to put you to sleep and wake you up at any time you want.
Now, uh, it'll only take you a few minutes to pick up Marilyn.
I'll set it to put you to sleep in an hour.
- There.
- Oh, fine!
I'm not working tomorrow, so I can sleep late.
Things are a little slack at the parlor.
For the past few days, everything's been going out with nothing coming in.
In that case,  You can sleep through the night.
I'll set it for 24 hours.
It'll wake you up at, uh, Oh, fine!
Uh, but, Grandpa.
Is it all right to take one of these on an empty stomach?
Sure!
Well, that really was empty.
Hello, Aunt Lily, Grandpa.
What happened to Uncle Herman?
What happened to him?
Well, he went down to the museum to pick you up.
Well, I waited for him, but I didn't see him anyplace, so I took a taxi home.
Oh!
That Herman!
I shouldn't ever let him go anywhere alone!
Sometimes he gets so flaky.
Marilyn?
Marilyn?
Marilyn?
Marilyn?
Marilyn?
Marilyn, Marilyn?
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn?
?
Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn, Marilyn Life is but a dream?
Oh, stop it, Herman.
You're not here to have fun.
Oh, I guess she's gone.
I must have missed her.
Mmm!
Hmm.
Locked.
Darn!
Well, I'll just have to rip it off its hinges.
No.
Better not.
It does not behoove a good citizen to desecrate cultural landmarks.
I'll just telephone the proper authorities and have them let me out.
Must be a telephone booth around here somewhere.
Oh!
Hi, there!
Uh, we have a little fella just like you at home.
Oh.
There are the phone booths.
Hmm.
Fancy ones.
Oh!
Uh, oh, excuse me, sir.
I didn't know this phone was taken.
Uh, I'll use the one over there.
Uh, sorry.
Huh.
Door seems to be stuck.
Hmm.
No one in here.
You'd think they could put a light in these things.
Just hope I can get this call through before Grandpa's pill hits me.
Uh, let's see.
Where's the phone?
Say, there.
Uh, say there.
Uh, listen.
Someone closed the door.
Uh, who closed the door?
Say, is there anyone out there?
Uh, say, listen.
Someone let me out.
!
Let me out.
!
Let me out.
!
In other words, Dr. Wilkerson, you expect to find a fully preserved mummy when you open this sarcophagus.
That is our hope, gentlemen and lady.
From the carvings and hieroglyphics on the case, we believe this to be from the tomb of Ahmenhotep IV.
We're quite disturbed by the fact that last night we left the sarcophagus upright, and this morning we found it here on its back.
Yes.
We're not saying that anyone tried to steal it, but we do know that a find such as this would be quite valuable to any rival museum.
Do you have any worries about a curse on this mummy case, like there was on, uh, King Tut's tomb?
No, we're men of science.
Whatever we find in here you can be quite sure will not frighten us.
Thatcher?
Doctor, it's amazing!
He almost looks as though he's sleeping!
It's the most skillful job of embalming I've ever seen.
It's a great tribute to their ancient art.
Observe only slight traces of deterioration around the edges.
I'm sorry.
We've got to close the lid of the sarcophagus immediately.
We have no idea what effect the air may have on this ancient mummy.
Careful, Thatcher.
We'll open it again after we've gathered together some of the top Egyptologists from all over the world.
Do you plan to ship this to one of the large museums in the East?
Not at all.
This is our discovery.
Matter of fact, I don't mind telling you that the contents of this sarcophagus will leave this room over my dead body.
It's no use.
I can't eat my supper.
I'm so worried about Herman!
Aunt Lily, wherever he is, when Uncle Herman wakes up, he'll come home.
'Course he will!
I'm sure he's still asleep, 'cause every time I try to tune him in on my crystal ball, all I get is a herringbone pattern.
He probably holed up someplace and fell asleep.
Are you sure that silly sleeping pill of yours will wake him up at 10:00 tonight?
Sure, I'm sure.
I'd bet one of my lives on it.
Mom!
Marilyn!
Grandpa!
I found Pop!
You found Herman?
Where is he?
Right in the front page of this evening's newspaper.
"Local museum makes astounding find.
"Ancient mummy discovered.
"An ancient sarcophagus was opened today by the curator of the county museum, Dr. Wilkerson".
L-Look here.
!
Under Herman's picture.
!
"May be Ahmenhotep IV who ruled in the 18th Dynasty"?
This is terrible!
Uncle Herman in a box in a museum!
Gee, Mom.
How do you suppose it happened?
I don't know, Eddie, but it looks as if your father has goofed it again!
What's all this about a woman waiting to see me?
Well, I thought you'd better see this one, Doctor.
There she is.
Who What is it?
I don't know, sir.
But I think we ought to be, uh, very nice to her.
It could be another one of those Hollywood actresses come to make a donation.
Yes, well, if they want to throw their money away on culture, who are we to turn 'em down?
Uh, miss, this is our curator, Dr. Wilkerson.
How do you do?
I was just admiring your museum.
You have such lovely dead things on exhibit.
Thank you.
Now, how can we help you, madam.
Well, I came about this article and picture in the newspaper.
You see, he's mine.
You mean, he's your mummy?
Oh, no.
No.
He's my husband.
Now, if you'll show me where he is, I would like to talk to him.
"Talk to him"?
I'm afraid that's not too practical, madam.
You see, this man is He is no such thing!
I happen to know that he's not a day over 150.
Do you think I'd marry an old man?
Now, will you please take me to my husband.
Uh, will you excuse us for a moment?
What What do you think we should do, Doctor?
Well, she seems quite disturbed, and we don't want her to make a scene.
Perhaps if we show her the mummy, she'll stop insisting it's her husband.
Oh, good idea.
No woman in the world would claim to be married to anything that looks like that.
Well, here we are.
Will you give me a hand here, Thatcher?
Oh, yeah.
Well, there you are.
- What do you have to say now?
- Yes, that's Herman, all right.
He looks just like a little boy when he's asleep.
Asleep?
Herman.
Herman, it's time to wake up.
Uh, pussycat, it's time to go bye-bye.
Madam, I really don't think he's going to wake up.
You see  You know, you're right.
I forgot.
He wasn't set to wake up till 10:00.
Oh, dear.
I really must do my shopping.
Would you do me a favor?
A f A favor?
Yes.
Here's two dollars.
Now, when he wakes up, would you put him in a cab and send him home?
- Put him in a cab?
- Yes.
He knows the address.
It's 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
Oh, and by the way, ask Herman to give the driver a fifty-cent tip.
Good-bye, now.
Oh, and you two have been just a couple of sweethearts.
What do you think, Thatcher?
Well, sir, when the when the visitors start looking weirder than the exhibits, I think it's time to get out of the museum business.
Nonsense.
I think she's some kind of a plant to size up our layout.
This morning, we found the sarcophagus on its side, and now she uses that ridiculous story to come in here and get a look at our mummy.
Then you really think someone is definitely trying to steal our mummy.
We can't afford to take any chances.
We'll post a 24-hour guard, and I want you to stay here all night and don't take your eyes off that sarcophagus.
Right, Dr. Wilkerson.
Come in!
Come in!
Hmm.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello.
Hello.
Hello?
Hello?
Is anyone out there?
Yes.
I'm out here.
- Where are you?
- I'm in here.
You can't be in here.
I'm in here.
Oh.
Hi.
I was dead to the world.
Some stupid idiot locked the door!
- Oh, that can be annoying.
-  Oh, now, wasn't that nice of him to open the door for me like that?
Here's your favorite soup, dear cream of vulture.
Oh!
Thank you, Lily.
Poor Uncle Herman.
You had such a terrible experience!
It's real neat having you back, Pop.
While you were gone, I had to mess up my homework by myself.
It proves one thing My sleeping pill works.
Yes, but, Grandpa, you don't know how it feels to wake up in a cold, clammy box.
What do you mean?
I do it every morning!
Pop, are you gonna sue the newspaper for calling you a dead mummy?
Oh, I think not, Eddie.
We shouldn't be too hasty to retaliate when someone treats us ill.
In other words, one who fights fire with fire only gets in trouble with Smokey the Bear.
Hot!
What do you mean, the mummy got out of his case and walked out of here?
But he did, Doctor!
He got out, and he spoke to me and everything!
If you don't believe me, ask the gorilla!
I'll tell you what happened.
You went to sleep in there, and someone broke in the door and stole our mummy.
No, Doctor.
No.
No.
They've probably been planning this ever since we put that story in the paper.
The type of gang who steals paintings and other objects of art.
But we do have one clue.
The woman who came in here with that ridiculous story gave us an address uh, 1313 Mockingbird Lane.
Well, what are you gonna do?
First, I'm demoting you to custodian of our seashell collection.
Then I'll pick up a search warrant and a couple of officers and go over there.
That mummy is my passport to fame in the museum world.
If they have it anywhere on the premises, I'll have it back in its rightful place by nightfall.
Grandpa, I do not want to take another one of your sleeping pills.
The last time I did, it got me in big trouble.
It's very embarrassing, you know, to be taken for a dumb old mummy.
Herman, I've got this pill set for half an hour.
I'll sit right here till you wake up.
Nothing can possibly happen.
I don't want to take another pill!
I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!
Herman, if you take this pill like a good little boy, I'll give you a piece of candy.
I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!
I don't wanna!
I d With a caramel center?
With a caramel center.
When I wake up, will you give me another one?
When you wake up, you can have a whole boxful.
Goody!
But my stomach's kind of empty again.
It won't hurt a thing.
Lily always said you had a cast-iron stomach.
She must be right.
Yeah.
Uh Grandpa, your pill's not having any effect.
It's not even I tell you.
We don't have any mummy here.
I explained to you before, that was my husband you had at your old museum.
And as I told you before, madam, we have a search warrant, and we intend to search this house.
Oh, Aunt Lily, what are we going to do?
We'll just have your Uncle Herman tell this man to his face that he is not Ahmenhotep IV.
I'm his wife.
I certainly should know whether he was dead or not.
Now, he's down here.
You can go down and talk to him yourself.
I have lunch to get.
Come on, Marilyn.
Boy, what a weird setup!
Listen, anybody who'd steal mummies has to be a little weird.
There's nobody down here.
Wait a minute.
There's something there on this table.
This is it.
This is what we're after.
Shall we, uh, arrest those people upstairs?
No, we'll uh We'll get it back to the museum first.
We'll prosecute later.
Yeah, well, let's get out of here.
This place gives me the creeps.
Boy.
I was on the drunk detail for four years.
I never saw anybody as stiff as this.
Lily!
Lily!
Lily!
What is it, Grandpa?
What is it?
What is it?
I looked out the upstairs window, and some man put Herman in a station wagon and took him away!
Took him away?
But why?
They just went down to the dungeon to talk to him.
They couldn't have talked to him.
I gave him another one of my sleeping pills, and he was sound asleep!
Oh, Grandpa!
Why can't you experiment on white mice like any other normal mad scientist?
Now I suppose Herman will take another 24-hour catnap in that sarcophagus.
No, Lily.
This sleeping pill was set for only a half an hour.
Oh!
What What do you think will happen now?
I don't know, Lily.
But when Herman wakes up in the back of that station wagon, those men better have a box of candy with them.
Boy, this is the wildest assignment I've ever been on.
But it was worth it to me.
The unearthing of Ahmenhotep IV will put me on every front page in the country.
Has this guy really been in the ground 3,000 years?
Yes.
Perhaps longer.
I'll tell you one thing.
He looks better than my mother-in-law does right now.
You know, there's only three of us here.
I could've sworn I heard four of us laughing.
Uh, you know, that's a good one.
Uh, listen.
Speaking of mother-in-law jokes, did you ever hear   - Oh!
- Clear out!
Clear out!
Uh, taxi?
Taxi?
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
Herman, would you like to go to a movie tonight?
Oh, thank you, dear, but I'm working on my hobby.
Uh, Herman?
Hmm?
You're supposed to build the ship inside the bottle.
How are you gonna get it in when it's finished?
No trouble at all, dear.
It's easy when you cheat.
Grandpa, how 'bout you?
Would you like to take me to the movies?
Movies?
What's playing?
To Kill a Werewolf and Vampires of Blood Alley.
Lily, I go to the movies for escapism.
I don't wanna see everyday people doing everyday things.
Besides, I have to help Eddie with his homework.
Oh.
Again?
How about Marilyn?
Maybe she'll go with me.
She went over to one of her girlfriend's home.
Well, that's it.
Hmph.
Herman has his hobbies, Grandpa and Eddie study together, Marilyn has her school friends, and what do I have?
Absolutely nothing.
Well, I'm not just gonna sit around here and deteriorate.
Why not?
I've been doing it for years.
Well, even if I'm not needed around here, I can still make a useful contribution to society.
I'm going to get a job!
- Ajob?
- AJob?
Ajob!
Oh, Marilyn, here's one: "Secretary wanted.
Must type 120 words a minute".
She can't even write a note to the milkman without a dictionary.
There's one, Aunt Lily.
"Comptometer operator wanted".
"Comptometer operator".
She'd probably get the thing out in traffic and hit somebody.
Well, Marilyn, I have six or seven ads circled here.
I want to get started early.
Would you come upstairs with me and help me choose something nice to wear to the interviews?
I want to look my very best.
Yes, Aunt Lily.
It's very important you make a good impression.
You know something, Grandpa?
I think she's very serious about getting a job, and I am totally against it!
What am I gonna do?
Herman, listen to me.
Lily is not going to get a job.
She has no experience.
Take my advice and just ignore the whole thing.
You don't think I should stand up to her?
Order her to give up this idea and put my foot down as lord and head of the household.
No, I don't.
Well, good, 'cause every time I do that, she laughs at me.
Well, Mr. Franklin?
L I'm sorry, Mrs. Munster, but I just remembered.
We filled this position this morning.
Ready now, Irving.
This is Colette.
That will do, Colette.
But he didn't say anything.
His eyes plainly said no.
Well!
Next, this is Millicent.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
I think not, Millicent.
I hope he gets a concussion.
Irving, my new line of clothes is not designed for the Northwest Mounted Police.
I need a model.
A model who is different.
Someone with a, a warm, exotic flamboyance.
Someone, in short, my dear Irving, who has great flair!
There's more waiting, Mr. Brastoff.
Would you come in, please?
This is Lily.
That's what I call flair!
Oh!
Thank you.
Irving, she's enchanting.
Tell those other girls they can go home now.
Yes, Mr. Brastoff.
Lily.
Lily, my dear, I don't know when I've seen a model who so perfectly reflects the exotic and mysterious appeal of my new line of dresses.
Oh!
Oh, thank you.
You see, what I am trying to do here is to recreate the kind of allure that was reflected by women like, oh, Theda Bara.
They called her "The Vamp".
That's short for "vampire".
But, of course, you wouldn't know anything about that.
Oh, yes, I would!
That's a very common nickname in my family.
Anyway, what I'm attempting here also in certain of my dresses is to bring back an era that is gone.
I'm trying to revive the dead, if you like.
If I like?
I've always thought that was a fun thing.
Lily, I can just picture my customers' faces at my next showing when you come out in a Lazlo Brastoff original creation and float around the room.
Oh!
Like this?
Lily, you're magnificent!
Oh!
I rush to embrace you!
Ah-ah-ah!
Tut-tut, Mr. Brastoff.
Lily, you're hired!
Grandpa, it's bad enough having my wife working, but I just cannot stand for Lily being a fashion model.
Now, Herman, let's not be too hasty.
It may not be all bad.
After all, modeling is a very respectable profession.
Well, maybe.
And she'll make good money, and the work is easy.
Why, all she has to do is just put on the latest creations and walk up and down in front of the customers.
Well, I guess you could be right.
- Now, when these men - Men?
Well, you know.
Most of the out-of-town buyers are men.
You know what they look like.
You've seen their pictures in the magazines.
Those handsome, well-dressed fellows with two or three chicks on each arm.
I'll bet those rascals have a ball every day just sitting there and watching those models come out in negligees and swimsuits  And take 'em out to dinner at night.
You ain't kiddin', Herman.
Boy, I tell you.
There must be a lot of hanky-panky goes on in that business.
I just remembered.
The hanky they'll be playing panky with is my wife.
You know, you're right.
It's not only your wife, it's my daughter.
Lily!
Lily!
You come right down here this minute!
I am not gonna let her take that job, and that's that!
Uncle Herman, you were calling Aunt Lily?
You're darn right I was.
I want you to get that man-chasing home-wrecker right down here, tout de suite.
!
You can't mean Aunt Lily.
I can and I do.
Now get her down here!
Well, I'm afraid I can't, Uncle Herman.
You see, she left about an hour ago for her modeling job.
But She left an hour ago for her modeling job.
Well, Herman, what do you think of that?
I'm so mad, I could go right through the ceiling!
Herman!
Herman, will you come down here and talk this thing over sensibly?
This is no time to be hiding in the attic!
Eddie, have you seen your father and Grandpa?
Oh, they're down in the dungeon working on something.
It must be real neat because when I knocked on the dungeon door, they told me to get lost.
You suppose they're figuring out some way to keep Mom from working?
Eddie, where did you hear about that?
Some people have awfully big ears.
Neat, isn't it?
Grandpa, what are you doing with all these little jars?
Well, Herman, if Lily's going to have a job as a model, we are gonna fight fire with fire.
You mean we're gonna burn down the place where she's working?
No, Herman.
If she is gonna make you jealous, you are gonna make her jealous by becoming a playboy.
Oh!
You know, I've always fancied myself as a playboy.
GeorgieJessel has always been my idol.
Yeah, well, my instant disguises are a little more up to date than that.
Mel Torme.
Dean Martin.
"Pat Boone"?
How did that get in here?
"Mr. Clean"?
Herman, don't laugh.
He's a real big swinger when he's not making commercials.
Don't let that earring fool ya.
Oh!
Here it is!
Frank Sinatra.
Oh, good, good, fine.
Give me one of those.
You know, I've always felt rather simpatico with Frankie.
Okay, Herman, down the hatch.
Ring-a-ding-ding.
What's the matter, Grandpa?
Don't I grab you?
No, Herman.
You're not as young as you used to be.
I don't think you're up to being Sinatra.
In fact, these days, I don't know if Sinatra is up to being Sinatra.
Let me see now.
"Mickey Rooney.
'" "Cesar Romero".
No, no.
Richard Burton.
Oh, good.
But I'm surprised they let these in the country.
Don't you see they're marked "for adults only"?
Ain't exactly taking kiddies' aspirin there.
There you go, Herman.
Cheerio.
To be or not to be.
That is the question.
No.
No, I don't think so, Grandpa.
I just want to make Lily jealous, not drive her out of her mind.
Listen, Herman, if you're going to be a playboy, I've got just the thing.
A Texas playboy!
Why are the Texas pills so big?
Well, only one-eighth is chemical.
The rest is baloney.
Go ahead.
Force it down.
Y'all come by and see us at the ranch anytime, hear?
Oh, Herman, you're irresistible!
Any woman who saw you now would just flip her lid.
Uncle Herman, will you be home for lunch?
Oh, Uncle Herman, you're the funniest thing I've ever seen in my whole life!
What are you trying to do, gonna play cowboys and Indians with Eddie?
No, I'm not.
And furthermore, I won't be home for lunch.
Oh, all right.
If I'm so irresistible, how come Marilyn laughed at me?
Herman, I think I better put a little insurance in this package.
Now, when you walk into that shop where Lily is modeling, you are going to have a beautiful girl on your arm.
But I don't want to go there with a strange girl.
Herman, please.
I'll mix one up for you.
And now, I'm gonna add a touch of 36-25-36.
I'll have a beautiful girl for you in ten seconds.
Grandpa, are you sure this will work?
Well, l Herman, of course it'll work!
It'll work 100 percent!
Well, what do you think, big boy?
I guess I'll have to settle for 80 percent.
Come on, Herman.
Let's get going.
Uh, you know something, Grandpa?
Every husband should have a father-in-law just like you.
Here we see Carlotta again, this time in a sparkling two-piece ensemble.
So correct and charming for both those special parties and delightful home entertaining.
And now for his most exclusive collection, Lazlo Brastoff presents a beautiful pure silk suit in tones ofblue.
Oh, beautiful.
!
Beautiful.
!
Well, thank you, Mr. Brastoff.
No, not you.
The suit!
Lily.
!
Mmm.
!
You are magnifiicent.
!
Oh, Lily, you are out of this world.
Oh, thank you, but I haven't been there for years.
Mr. Brastoff, I have such news for you that I think I shall just go to pieces.
Irving, you're stealing my thunder.
Girls, in the audience and I saw it with my own eyes there's a wealthy Texan with his girlfriend!
He would have his girlfriend.
That's exactly what I'm in the market for a wealthy Texan.
I guess you wouldn't be interested, though, would you, Lily?
Oh, my!
Certainly not.
I have the most wonderful.
Handsome, sweetest, kindest man waiting at home for me.
Oh, lucky you.
!
I could travel to the four corners of the earth, and I'd never find anybody like that.
Ah, true, true.
Mmm!
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Now another Brastoff triumph.
Sheer magic, as worn by one of our top models, Lily Munster.
Lily is featuring one of the true Lazlo Brastoff originals black velvet pants with a lovely leopard top.
The hat is Russian fox and is ostentatiously detailed by the specially designed lengthy fox stole.
Now isn't that exquisite?
It's working beautifully, Herman.
Did you see that look on her face when she spotted us?
Wasn't that something?
Just keep ignoring her.
Yeah.
Grandpa, you've had a lot of ideas in your time, but this is Grandpa.
Grandpa.
The cigar, the cigar.
Oh, yeah, I forgot myself.
Wha Here.
Wait'll Lily comes out again.
This time we'll really lay it on thick.
She'll quit her job right on the spot.
Here we see Carlotta again, this time in a sparkling two-piece ensemble.
So correct and charming for both those special parties and delightful home entertaining.
The top is pure silk with a tapered full-length sheet of ivory silk.
What a wolf!
Did you see that look that Texan gave me?
This is working out great.
Watch it.
Here she comes.
- Now this time, Lily truly sparkles.
- How am I doin', Herman?
Great.
I'll tell you one thing, Grandpa.
It's a whole lot better than when you turned yourself into a frog.
Diamond-studded shoes add an extra touch ofbrilliance to one of Lazlo Brastoff's most beautiful and eye-catching originals.
Lily, you're sure to be the belle of any ball.
Lovely.
Thank you.
What happened?
Grab the chair!
Oh, this is terrible!
Here, help me pull it off!
Somebody do something.
!
Oh, my, my!
Madam, I'm so terribly sorry!
Oh, this is terrible.
Watch it, buster!
Huh?
What's the matter?
Haven't you ever seen a girl before?
Say, listen, you.
Take your hands off my grandfather.
Grandfather?
Lazlo Brastoff, you have had it.
But, Lily, dear, you've got to believe me.
It was just a misunderstanding.
Huh!
The next thing you'll be telling me is that blonde on your arm was Grandpa.
But I tell you, it was Grandpa!
You got that job modeling, and I was just trying to make you jealous.
Oh, that is the most ridiculous story I have ever heard!
But, Lily, it's true!
Grandpa's downstairs now, getting the potion.
And when he comes walking through that door as a beautiful girl, you're gonna throw yourself in my arms and beg forgiveness just like Constance Bennett does on the late, late show.
There's Grandpa now.
Come in, dear.
But, Grandpa, you're not a girl at all!
What happened?
What happened?
It's empty.
Somebody drank the rest of the potion.
Oh, now I've heard everything!
But, Lily!
Lily, dear  Can I come in, Mom?
Yes, Eddie.
Eddie, what happened to you?
I don't know.
I drank something in Grandpa's lab I thought was a soft drink and now look what happened.
It's true!
Oh, Herman!
Oh, Herman, please forgive me for ever doubting you.
Thank you, Constance Bennett.
Grandpa, how long will I stay this way?
I don't know.
Two, maybe three hours.
Give you a chance to learn how the other half lives.
But I've gotta pitch on the school baseball team this afternoon.
What will I do?
Pray for rain or learn to pitch underhanded.
{END OF EPISODE 33}{START OF EPISODE 34}
Oh, my, that looks yummy, Lily.
I'll bet there's not a family on the block that's having a meal like this tonight.
Well, thank you, dear.
But before we start, Eddie has some news for us tonight about school, haven't you, Eddie?
That's right.
This Saturday night is talent night at school.
- Talent night?
- Yeah.
It's going to be held in the school gym.
And if any kid has someone in his family who has talent, he's supposed to volunteer them to perform.
And did you volunteer a member of your family to perform?
Oh, sure.
I volunteered the one who has the most talent off all.
Fine.
- What time do I have to be there?
- Oh, I didn't volunteer you, Grandpa.
I told 'em my Pop would perform on talent night.
- Herman?
- Me?
Uh, hmm, hmm.
Well, uh, well, now.
How about that?
?
?
?
?
Herman?
Herman?
Herman!
May I ask you something?
Why of course, Grandpa.
Just what do you think you're doing?
I'm trying to decide what to sing at Eddie's school on talent night.
You are going to sing?
That's right.
And why not?
After all, as they used to say "Herman Munster has the finest set of pipes in Transylvania".
Herman, they were talking about your circulatory system, not your singing.
Very funny.
You're just jealous because Eddie volunteered me instead of you.
And as that great philosopher, Steve Allen, has said on many occasions "Jealousy is the stinkweed in the garden of life".
?
Sweetest little fella?
?
Everybody knows?
?
Don't know what to call him?
?
But he's mighty like a rose?
?
Herman, wh-what happened?
Uh, what happened?
Bobby Darin here just brought down the house.
Grandpa.
Grandpa, there must be something Herman can do to entertain on talent night.
If he lets Eddie down, he'll be so disappointed.
I know, Lily.
And when it comes to Herman, I'm going to break a long-standing American tradition.
I'm gonna be nice to my son-in-law.
How kind and noble you've become since you've started reading Mary Worth.
What are you gonna do?
Come with me, Lily.
I'll show you.
- Ballet slippers?
- Magic ballet slippers.
When Herman puts these on, he'll get instant talent.
I got the recipe from Hans Christian Andersen.
I'll show you how they work.
"Ballet, Old Soft Shoe, Mexican Hat Dance, the Twist.
'" Now, I take this magic dancing powder, sprinkle it on the shoes, and they start to dance.
"Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake, Nutcracker Suite Swing it, shoesies, with a ballet beat".
?
?
Oh, Grandpa, how wonderful!
I know.
Okay, fellows, that's enough for now.
Take five.
Herman, I made these ballet slippers in your size 26E.
I'll just tie a little bow over the ankle.
Oh, they're so cute.
But gee, Lily, l Golly, I don't want to do the ballet at Eddie's school.
People might get the wrong impression.
You know, that I was a Communist or something.
You don't have to do the ballet.
Just pick any magic dancing powder you want for any kind of dance you want.
Be my guest.
Go ahead, Herman, for Eddie's sake?
All right.
Hmm.
Uh, let's try the Old Soft Shoe.
Good.
There always was a little Gene Kelly in me.
Where they got it from, I'll never know, but there was.
Put the other foot on, please.
Thank you.
A little Soft Shoe.
There you are.
Hurry, Grandpa, I'm so excited.
You know, I think I'll sprinkle a little Indian Rain Dance powder on.
We've had a dry spell lately.
Might as well kill two birds with one stone.
"Heel and toe it, make us know it.
Strut your stuff and really show it".
Whoosh!
Uh!
He's doing the ballet.
Holy mackerel!
That's not "Soft Shoe".
I used the wrong powder.
Oh, dear!
He can't stop!
Grandpa, do something.
Oh, this is terrible!
How long will he keep on dancing?
Oh, two, maybe three hours.
Well, there's one consolation.
At least he'll be home in time for lunch.
Oh, well, it's not a total loss.
It's started to rain.
Ooh.
Oh, that feels good.
Ahh.
Herman.
Herman, will you listen to me?
Look, all I have to do is take these shoes to the shoemaker, have them resoled and then the night of the talent show you'll be in business again.
Uh, no, no, Grandpa.
It's no use.
When it comes to talent, Herman Munster is a complete washout.
I'm just gonna have to tell my little boy that his daddy is a great big stupid lox.
No, dear.
You're a great big lovable lox.
Pop.
!
Pop.
!
Hey, Pop.
!
I just talked to my teacher again about talent night, Oh, uh and you won't have to sing or dance or juggle or any of that corny stuff.
Oh, good, because 'Cause I volunteered you for the best spot of all.
I said you were the world's greatest magician.
Oh, boy.
!
Well, Herman, the world's greatest magician.
Uh, what do you have to say to that?
Bibble ibble ibble ibble ibble ibble ibble ibble.
?
?
There.
I shall now make a few passes over the hat and I shall proceed to pull a live chicken from the hat.
- Oh, Herman, you're so clever.
- Please, dear.
Don't egg me on.
This is the loosest chicken I ever saw.
If you'll just allow me a few minutes for a little bit more practice?
Of course, Uncle Herman.
Now you just call us when you're ready.
Fine.
Fine.
I'll be ready.
Brawwk!
What's up, Doc?
Uh, I seem to have run out of eggs.
Uh, do you think you could oblige?
Don't look at me, buster.
My name's Charlie.
Brawwk!
At least he could have made an effort.
Please, Grandpa.
You've got to do the magic for Uncle Herman.
Oh, but you mustn't let him know.
It would just break his heart.
I'm sorry.
I helped him with the dancing shoes.
I'm not gonna try again.
Grandpa, how can you act like that after all Herman has done for you?
Why, if it wasn't for him, you'd still be back in the Old Country, hanging around in some damp old cave, scratching fleas out of your wings and wondering who your next square meal was coming from.
I guess you're right, Lily.
In the hustle-bustle of daily living, we're inclined to forget those golden moments of kindness.
I'll do it.
Where is the bum?
Now, here we are.
And now, without further ado  I shall proceed to pull a live chicken from the hat.
I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
I'm a magician!
Oh, boy!
Lily, this book how corny can you get?
It's got jokes with the tricks yet.
Never mind the jokes, Grandpa.
When Herman does those tricks tonight at school, are you sure they're gonna work?
Lily, with me in the wings, he'll look like the greatest magician since Merlin.
Why, there's not a trick in this book that I can't do with my eyes closed.
Oh, Marilyn, lunch is almost ready.
Have you seen Herman and Eddie?
Oh, yes.
They're down in the lab.
Uncle Herman wants to practice his magic act, so he'll be all ready for tonight.
He's so proud thinking he can do magic.
I hope nothing goes wrong.
How can anything go wrong?
If he sticks to the tricks in this book, there's not a chance of him making a boob of himself.
?
?
Well, Herman, you're on next.
This is your chance, Herman.
Grandpa, Grandpa, Grandpa.
Calm down, calm down.
Anyone would think you were performing.
Just stand in the wings and watch.
Yes.
Uh, thank you very much, Teddy Branston's father.
Now I'm sure you all recognized "Clair de Lune" too.
Now, uh, according to our program here, we're in for a real treat.
Uh, we have magic, uh, as performed by Munster the Magnificent!
?
?
Now where did that come from?
I get it.
It's a gag.
He's a clown magician.
Yeah.
What a getup.
Gee, look at the size of that guy.
Wow!
Looks like there could be two fathers inside that costume.
Yeah.
I'd like to introduce myself.
I'm Herman Munster, and my family's in the iron and steel business.
My mother irons and my father steals.
-  - Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, oh, please.
Oh, oh, you're too kind.
Thank you.
Tonight, I have some amazing magic in store for you, but first, I would like to introduce my assistant, Marilyn Munster.
?
?
Five, six, seven, eight  Now you know what's been holding up the act.
These aren't mine.
They belong to my brother-in-law.
But he doesn't need them.
His wife is the one who wears the pants in his family.
Grandpa!
Wasn't there a rabbit in that hat?
I got it out just in time.
The big goof!
And now, miss, if you would permit me to place this egg on your head.
And now, if you will watch my assistant closely.
I guess she must have had bats in her belfry.
The last time I saw a ham that big, it was in a butcher's window.
And now for the grand finale.
My wife is standing in the wings.
I'm going to ask my wife to come out here on stage, and I am then going to proceed to make my wife disappear.
A trick which any husband should appreciate.
Make me disappear?
What is this?
I don't know.
Th-That trick wasn't in the book.
Excuse me.
Come on, Lily, we're on.
But, Herman, you can't do that trick.
And just why can't I?
'Cause it's not in the book, and I don't know it.
Who cares whether you know it or not?
I'm doing the magic.
Come on.
No.
Herman, I have news for you.
Uh, well, Grandpa's been standing back here in the wings making all your tricks work for you.
That's right.
I've done every one of them.
Oh, I get it.
I've been out there doing magic and making a big hit  And you want to stand here in the wings and get all the credit.
Uh, be right with you, folks.
Hear that?
Hear that?
That proves I'm a better magician than you are.
Hear that applause?
Those are my people.
Come on, Lily.
But, Herman Lily, dear, come on.
They're calling for us.
The show must go on.
Ladies and gentlemen Mrs. Munster.
I want you to take a good look at her, because she's not gonna be here long.
I wish you now to observe this cabinet.
Solid on this side, solid in back, solid solid solid all the way around.
And now, Lily, dear, if you please.
?
?
Isn't that just like a woman?
She doesn't want to go anywhere where she can't spend money.
"Alakazee, kazi, kazeer.
Woman in the cabinet, disappear"!
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
?
?
And now, ladies and gentlemen, uh, for a more difficult trick and to me, a more painful trick.
I will now make my wife reappear.
"Alakazee, kazi, kazeer.
Woman in the cabinet, reappear"!
Thank you.
Not now.
Marilyn, not now during the bows, dear.
Not during the applause, dear.
Lily, where are you?
Lily?
Lily?
Uh, where are you, dear?
Lily.
!
Lily!
Lily!
Come back, Lily!
Lily!
Lily!
Uh-Uh-Uh, Grandpa, help me!
"Alakazee, kazi, kazeer"!
Lily!
Lily!
Uh, listen, Eddie, uh, about your mother Pop, we've looked for her a million times.
She isn't there.
She's disappeared.
Yes, well, I wanted to talk to you about this.
Uh, just come over here.
I want to, uh, tell you something.
What is it, Pop?
Eddie, I've just discovered something.
What?
I'm a widow and you're an orphan, and it's all my fault.
Hi, Herman.
Oh, Grandpa!
What's new?
Grandpa!
Grandpa, you've got to help me!
You've got to make Lily reappear!
Me?
You're the big magician.
All I do is stand in the wings and watch.
Oh, Grandpa, Grandpa.
I'm sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.
The trick backfired.
Well, how could that have happened?
Well, all I did was I'll show you.
I put Lily in the cabinet I pull the curtain, I said a few magic words, and I push the button and then I open the curtains and she was gone.
Grandpa, you've got to help me.
Lily!
Lily, you've you've come back!
Hi, Mom.
I'm glad you're back.
Pop was really crackin' up.
Oh, was he, Eddie?
Oh, thank you, Grandpa, thank you.
Lily, sweetheart, I will never do magic again.
I shall be humble and contrite and Oh, Lily, I don't know what I'd do without you.
Believe me, Lily, I don't.
Do you really mean that, pussycat?
Of course I do, sweetheart.
Besides, your-your name's on all the bath towels.
And if I ever got married again, I'd have to find someone named Lily.
{END OF EPISODE 34}{START OF EPISODE 35}
Lily, Grandpa, Marilyn?
Daddy's home.
Oh!
Hello, dear.
My, you look happy today.
I am happy, Lily, because, as we say down at the parlor, this has been a very monumental day.
Has something happened, Uncle Herman?
Yes, Marilyn.
I have some wonderful news!
Uh, where's Grandpa?
Here I am, Herman.
I was down in the dungeon helping Eddie fix his train set.
Oh.
Sounds as though you got it fixed.
Well, Herman, don't keep us hanging in midair.
What's your wonderful news?
Well, it's vacation time again, and I have purchased a beautiful hideaway where we can all relax and enjoy our leisure moments.
with a piece of junk.
No such thing.
I bought 10 acres in Happy Holiday Valley through an ad in a magazine.
You bought 10 acres by mail?
You see here?
With the purchase of any homesite, we get the use of their wonderful recreational facilities, excellent transportation, and it's smog-free.
That means you don't have to pay for it.
Uh, plenty of water.
Close to schools Oh, Herman, it sounds wonderful.
"For family fun and relaxation, come to Happy Holiday Valley".
Even I'll have to admit, that sounds like the kind of place I'd like to be found dead in.
Aunt Lily?
I'm ready to leave.
Is there anything I can help you with?
No.
I was just pulling down the blinds, so the house will look gloomy and lived in while we're gone.
Oh, we're all going to have such a wonderful vacation.
I'll say!
Bring on the girls!
Now, you get back in your clock!
When is that silly bird going to get girls off his mind?
Nevermore, nevermore.
Get!
Well, I guess everything's ready.
Good-bye, Spot!
Mom, wouldn't it be better if we left Spot in the garage?
Oh, no, Eddie.
No.
Last time we did, he drank all the gasoline out of the power mower.
And then he got the hiccups and melted all the wrought-iron furniture.
Are you ready to leave, Grandpa?
Just a minute.
All set?
All set.
Herman?
Herman, where are you?
I'll be right with you, Lily.
I'm, uh talking to the real estate office that handles our property, and I'm letting him know that we're coming up to Happy Valley.
That's right.
This is Herman Munster.
I bought 10 acres from your ad.
It-It was in that magazine, the Jujitsu Annual.
Ah, yes.
One of our many satisfied customers.
Who is it?
That Munster character the one that fell for our ad in that crummy magazine.
Uh, yes, Mr. Munster.
What can I do for you?
Well, Mr. Walters, I thought I'd take the family out for a spin today to see our property.
Uh, sir, do I understand you to say you are going up to Happy Holiday Valley?
That's right.
We plan to take advantage of your excellent recreational facilities, your wonderful transportation and your marvelous Uh, sir, uh, when are you planning to go?
- Today.
- Today?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello, hello?
Hmm.
Must have been cut off.
I hope he doesn't think I hung up on him.
He sounded like such a pleasant fellow.
Oh, well.
Well, it's on to Happy Holiday Valley.
Well, here we are Happy Holiday Valley.
You know, Herman, I had heard that these real estate brochures were inclined to exaggerate.
But this is more beautiful than they described it.
Oh, it's just it's just absolutely breathtaking.
Uh, just as advertised.
There are the superb transportation facilities.
Oh, and look!
Plenty of water!
Mmm.
Nice and soft.
Not like the hard water at home.
And look!
There's a playground for kids!
Ooh!
And here are the excellent entertainment and recreational facilities.
Well, I must say Hmph!
You know, this is a real swinging place.
!
It appears that it was fortunate running into you gentlemen.
Yes, it certainly was.
As I understand it, Mr. Curtis, you represent, uh, Cunningham Aeronautics.
We were happy to cancel our quick trip to Mexico to talk to you.
Good.
Now, then.
We have plans to use that area in and around your Happy Holiday Valley property as a missile site.
I'm here to make you a flat offer of $50,000 for the entire piece of land.
- It's a deal.
- Barney The man offered $50,000, partner.
I'm sure you will go along with me.
Yes, Barney.
Fine.
This is our initial proposal.
I'll be back first thing in the morning to finalize the deal.
Good.
We'll see you then.
Good day.
Good day.
Barney, we don't own all of Happy Holiday Valley.
We unloaded some of it to that Munster character.
Gil, baby, Munster's going up to look at the property today, right?
Right.
Okay.
So he takes one look at that hunk of junk he bought, we offer to refund his two grand, which he takes back like that, and we're in the clear for the Cunningham deal.
Yes, but, uh, do you think it'll work?
Look.
Anyone who falls for an ad like ours has got to be a sucker.
This Munster sounds like a real live one.
A real live one.
Golly.
I haven't had a bite since we've been here.
Patience, Eddie.
Patience.
But, gee, wouldn't it be better if we fished in a stream with water in it?
Eddie, anyone can fish in a stream with water in it.
This is a challenge the kind of challenge the youth of today is so badly in need of.
I got one.
I got one!
I got one!
Play him, Grandpa!
Play him!
-  Don't let him get away.
!
- Oh, boy.
This is a whopper!
Stay with him, Grandpa!
Here he comes.
Oh, oh!
Isn't he a lovely one!
Isn't that a beauty?
Well, I for one am not gonna be out-fished.
Well, the bait's still good.
Oh, dear me.
I'm afraid I've damaged the recreational facilities.
Uh, pardon us.
We're looking for a Mr. Munster.
Well, I'm his niece, Marilyn.
He's not here right now.
Uh, perhaps you'd like to talk with my Aunt Lily.
She's fixing supper.
Aunt Lily!
Uh, good day, Mrs. Munster.
I'm Mr. Walters, and this is my partner, Mr. Crane.
We, uh, sold you folks the property.
No!
You mean, you sold us this property?
Uh, yes.
But put that down.
Violence'll get you no place.
Oh!
I was just stirring up some oxtail soup.
Oh, I can't tell you how much we love this place.
- You love this place?
- Mmm.
It's beautiful.
Isn't it, Marilyn?
Oh, it's lovely.
Uh, look, madam, I think there's something you should know.
Uh, this is nothing but a ghost town.
A ghost town!
Isn't that wonderful, Marilyn?
Maybe we'll have company dropping in on us over the weekend.
Oh.
Excuse us a minute.
My oxtail soup is getting restless.
What do you think?
Maybe they heard about the Cunningham missile deal, and they're just trying to boost the price up.
That's right.
I'll offer them double their money back.
- Now, you were saying?
- I'll get right down to cases, Mrs. Munster.
We're ready to pay you double your money if you'll sell us the property back.
Oh, my, no.
We're all so crazy about it, and I'm sure my husband wouldn't sell it at any price.
Good day, gentlemen.
Come on, Gil.
I got another angle.
Uh, thank you for your time, madame.
And thank you for your flattering offer.
But you understand.
It's so hard to find a good vacation spot since they closed down Devil's Island.
Yes.
Well, uh, good-bye.
You said you had an angle, Barney.
What was it?
Get in.
Look.
We can't buy the place back, so we'll scare 'em off, see?
This is a ghost town, right?
Right.
So tomorrow night, we'll turn it into a real ghost town.
Now, these Munsters are going to be nervous anyway, spending their first night in this dump.
Wait till they hear strange voices and screams and the whole works.
They'll go out of their skulls, and tomorrow they'll be begging us to take the place back.
Barney, that's a $50,000 idea.
Here we are.
How does it look?
Oh, Grandpa!
That's lovely.
Just what the room needed.
Eddie, it's almost time for you to go to bed.
When are you and your father going to be through with the comics?
Just a second, Mom.
"And then the mechanical men disintegrated all the spider people, "and they disappeared in a ball of flame.
Ooh!
"Once again, good had triumphed over the forces of evil from outer space".
Oh, boy, Eddie.
Uh, that was a good one.
Uh, read me another one.
I can't now, Pop.
I have to go to bed.
Oh, darn, darn!
Lily?
- Just one more?
- No, Herman.
Eddie has to get to bed.
Could I have my cowboy outfit back now, Pop?
I'm not though playing with it yet, Eddie.
All right.
Good night, Pop.
Good night, son.
Bartender?
See what the boys in the back room will have.
Herman, will you stop playing cowboy and go outside and get some wood for the fire?
Right away, dear.
Reach for the ceiling!
JesseJames!
Hmm.
And it looks so easy on television.
Herman.
The firewood.
Yes, Lily.
Oh!
Some daughters marry doctors.
Some daughters marry dentists.
You had to marry Henny Youngman.
Never mind, Grandpa.
Oh, there's some!
I think Herman's found some wood.
Don't you just love to watch a fire?
Lily, I've seen Chicago, San Francisco and the burning of Rome.
You've seen one, you've seen 'em all!
Uh, here's the wood, Lily.
Ooh.
!
Where'd you get all the wood, Herman?
I had to break up a building, dear.
I do hope there was no one in it.
Oh, Lily, I've been thinking about those two men.
You said they were so anxious to buy this property back.
I wonder why.
Oh, it's very simple, dear.
They probably realized what a paradise it really is here.
Gil, we'll have these Munsters running in no time.
Yeah, we'll really scare 'em.
What's the matter?
That.
"Died June 6.
'" There's a story going around that Big Billy comes back every year and really spooks this place.
And today is June 6.
You big dummy.
That's just a story made up for the tourists to give the place some glamour.
I'm glad it's just a story, because the last guy I want to run into tonight is Big Billy.
Well, I think I'll toddle upstairs to bed.
Good night, pussycat.
Good night, dear.
I'll be right up.
What a great place for a vacation.
You know, this reminds me of the places I used to haunt in the Old Country.
We used to sit around the fireplace just like this and talk to our relatives, some of whom we hadn't seen in hundreds of years.
Oh, yes.
Hardly a night went by when someone didn't try to get in touch with us.
I remember  Wh What was that?
Grandpa, someone's trying to get in touch with us.
Yep.
It's my no-good Cousin Humphrey.
I'd recognize his knock anywhere.
- Grandpa, aren't you going to answer him?
- Not me.
We haven't spoken since he stole my aspirin during the Black Plague.
Hey, they're just ignoring us.
Yeah.
Here, this'll get 'em.
You got a dime?
?
?
Listen to that Cousin Humphrey.
He always was a rotten piano player.
Knock it off, Humphrey.
?
?
I said, knock it off.
?
?
Just our luck.
That no-good piano conks out on us now.
Well, I'm not gonna let Humphrey spoil my evening.
Why don't we all go to bed?
How do you like that?
They're going up to bed!
What are you doin'?
We'll let 'em get to sleep.
Then we'll give 'em the real scare treatment.
Barney, don't do that!
Oh, cut it out!
It's just us!
Here.
Get into this.
Herman?
Herman?
Yes, Captain Kangaroo, I will brush my teeth ev-every day.
Herman, wake up!
It's me!
Hmm?
What?
Hmm?
Huh?
What's the matter, dear?
I heard a noise downstairs!
Hmm?
There it is again.
Mm-hmm.
That was a noise, all right.
Herman!
Herman, there's someone downstairs!
Now, you go right down there and see who it is!
Oh, all right, dear, if I have to.
What are you doing with Eddie's hat and cap pistols?
Lily, you never know what you might run into.
I saw a Western on television once, and Nick Adams was prowling around.
Barney, somebody's comin'!
Good!
Wait till they get a load of us!
Hmm.
Must be some other guests.
Well, howdy, partners.
Well, I'll be hanged.
It's Big Billy!
Back from the dead!
Sir?
Sir?
Herman, what is it?
Hmm.
They were two guests, but I guess they decided not to stay.
Shame, too, 'cause they looked like a couple of fun fellas.
Hi, Mom.
Grandpa got the train working real neat now.
Hey, are we going to Happy Valley again for the next weekend?
I'm afraid not, Eddie.
Your father has just sold all the property up there.
But, gee, that was the only place we ever went to that seemed like home.
Now, now, Eddie.
You must not question your old dad's decision.
Uh, that's right, Eddie.
We sold that property to a very nice firm Cunningham Aeronautics.
These kind people are working on a missile which, in time of trouble, is gonna solve all our problems by blowing up the world.
Gee, Pop, if we can't go to Happy Valley, where will we spend our vacations?
Eddie, that's, uh that's a very good question.
Eddie, we can always enjoy the peace and solitude of our own little nest right here.
And as Frank Sinatra has said on so many occasions, be it ever so humble, there's no place like home.
Yes, Eddie.
Give me a house by the side of the road, and I'll be a friend to man.
I thought Edgar Allan Poe was a crackup.
Ooh!
{END OF EPISODE 35}{START OF EPISODE 36}
Vroom, vroom!
You're on the line.
You rev the mill, and you get the light from the timer.
You're off, burning rubber.
Vroom!
You watch the tach.
You shift the box.
Two.
Vroom.
Three.
Vroom.
Four.
Vroom.
You crack the eye, and you dump your chute, and it's a 177 with an 851 E.T.  Lily.
Oh, Lily.
Yes?
Lily, I wish you'd keep the front door closed.
Some strange boy just got in here and is speaking some foreign language.
Herman, th-that's our son, Eddie.
Yeah, Pop.
I'm just getting you into the mood for the drag strip this Saturday.
- "Drag strip"?
- Sure.
Sandy Baylor's father is a drag racer.
I told him my pop could beat his dad anytime, 'cause you're the best driver in the world.
Well, Eddie, it's wonderful that you're proud of your father and that you stick up for him.
But, Herman, a drag racer?
That's the funniest thing I ever heard in all of my lives.
- Eddie.
- Yeah, Pop?
Ignoring this hysterical person A drag racer!
And her unseemly guffaws may I ask you a question?
Sure.
What time on Saturday do I start burning rubber?
- You mean you'll do it, Pop?
- Eddie, I can answer that in two words.
Vroom!
Vroom!
Oh, dear!
What was that?
That is Herman out in the garage with Eddie, hopping up our car for the drag strip.
I don't know why Uncle Herman wants to become mixed up in racing.
You know Herman.
He always has to be a hero to his son.
I didn't know he knew anything about automobiles.
He's really full of surprises.
Full of surprises?
You should have seen his X-rays after his last physical.
There are some things in there that the doctors couldn't figure out at all.
Good morning, Grandpa.
Good morning.
Good morning.
Is it too late for a poor, broken-down old man to have some breakfast?
Not at all.
I kept yours hot for you.
Good.
?
?
There, now.
Is that warm enough for you?
It'll do.
Grandpa, aren't you going to help Uncle Herman and Eddie fix the car?
No, I'm not gonna help Uncle Herman and Eddie fix the car.
If anybody asks me why I'm not gonna help, I'll tell them why I'm not gonna help.
Why aren't you going to help?
I'm not going to help because nobody asked me to help.
Listen to that racket.
I hate to see Herman take a nice, normal family car and turn it into something weird and ridiculous.
Okay, Eddie, I think we're ready for another compression check.
Right, Pop.
You monitor the exhaust.
I'll activate the intake.
Ready?
Ready.
Fine.
It'll sound even better when we start the motor.
Now, for one last look at the steering linkage.
Okay, Pop.
A-okay.
I think we're ready for a test run.
Boy, we'll really wipe Sandy's father this Saturday.
Wipe him?
We'll clobber that Clyde.
I'm gonna practice my speed shifting.
First.
Second.
Third.
Fourth.
Now, isn't that annoying?
You know, Pop, I think when you shift, you ought to use the clutch.
Very well taken point.
Watch it, dearie.
That smarts.
Well, here I am.
I'm all ready for the drag strip.
I'm all stoked-up and ready to go.
Well, there he is my son-in-law, the 150-year-old teenage punk.
Herman.
Herman, l I wish you wouldn't do this.
Uh, I just can't, uh, fight it, chick.
I, uh, gotta get out there and drag it with the gassers.
Otherwise, doll, I might blow my cool.
Herman!
Herman, wh-what's come over you?
L-I just don't know you anymore.
What's happened to your Daddy Warbucks's image?
Uh, listen, doll, I haven't got the time right now.
Eddie's, uh, waitin' outside in the car.
We're gonna turn 137 and blast Sandy's old man right off the blacktop.
All right, Herman.
Go out there and beat him if you have to, but but don't go over the speed limit.
Well, aren't you gonna wish me luck, Grandpa?
Drop dead.
Well, that's better than nothing.
Uh, uh, good-bye, doll.
Hey, Dad, look what just came in.
Oh, boy, that's the oldest-looking teenager I ever saw.
That's Eddie and his dad.
Oh.
From the looks of his dad's face, he's been in some very bad smashups.
Let that be a lesson to you, son.
No one should ever go out on the strip without a roll bar.
Come on.
Hi, Eddie.
Oh, hi, Sandy.
Hey, Pop, I want you to meet Sandy Baylor and his father.
Oh.
Hi, Sandy.
And how do you do, Mr. Baylor?
Oh, sorry.
Uh, no charge for the grease job.
Yeah, sure.
Say, uh, mind if I ask you a question?
Certainly.
What is this?
Oh, this?
Oh, you, uh, noticed it.
This is just a little old everyday family car with a, uh, 425-cubic-inch engine, high-lift cam and 10 two-barrels.
You could've fooled me.
I thought they brought back the Edsel.
Um, well, I'm all set.
Where are your set of wheels?
Right over there.
Um, excuse me, sir, but what is that?
"What's that"?
That's a rail.
"A rail"?
Oh, yes!
One of my wife's relatives was once ridden out of town on one of those.
It wasn't quite that modern.
Boy, Eddie, is my pop gonna beat your pop.
He is not, 'cause my pop's the best driver in the whole world.
Oh, is that so?
Well, Munster, I was wondering if you'd like to match your kid's enthusiasm with a little side bet.
Bet?
Oh, well, uh, I think so.
I have four or five dollars on me.
Would you care to shoot the wad?
I'll tell you what just to make it an interesting bet, why don't we bet your car against mine?
Go ahead, Pop.
We'll wipe him.
You're the greatest.
Oh, well, you see, I don't think so.
See, this is our only car, and if I lost it, my wife would Gee, Pop, I think he's chicken.
All right, Baylor.
You got yourself a bet.
Good.
My car against yours.
What's the matter?
You're not afraid of losing your car, hotshot?
Me?
Of course not.
Did it again.
Hmm!
Listen to this.
It says, "In the next three-game series, the Yankees will be out for blood".
I tell you, that's a lot more fun than playing baseball.
Lily!
Lily, look here!
"Leadfoot Baylor Favored to Sweep Drags".
Why, Lily, that's Sandy Baylor's father.
The fellow Herman's gonna race today is a professional driver.
Oh!
Oh, dear.
When Herman finds that out, I hope he has the sense to call the whole thing off.
"Sense"?
Any grown man who still expects quarters from the tooth fairy ain't exactly an Einstein.
After all, if the man beats Uncle Herman, all he'll lose is his pride.
Now, give her the gun when you get the green flag.
Don't worry, Eddie.
I'll just keep my eye on the rearview mirror.
That's where he'll be all the time.
Good luck.
Wh-What did you say, Eddie?
I said, "Good luck".
Herman Munster, of all things!
You and Eddie having to come home on a bus.
Losing our car.
Uncle Herman, this is just terrible.
Didn't you know that that man was a professional race driver?
No, I didn't know that.
I thought he was just another goof like I was.
Herman, this is the worst thing you've done since you bought us that mausoleum at the cemetery, and we couldn't move in because there were no kitchen privileges.
How did I know it was a restrictive community, and they wouldn't take live people?
This is a nice mess you've got us into.
What are we gonna do without a car?
Well?
Do you know, Herman?
No, I'm afraid not, Lily.
Do you know, Marilyn?
No, I don't know.
Do you, Grandpa?
Ooh!
Ooh!
Well, Grandpa, why don't you give me the cold shoulder like the rest of my loyal family?
'Cause I happen to have the solution to this whole dilemma.
You aren't gonna try to talk me into shooting myself again, are you?
No.
I'm gonna build us a car that I'm gonna take to the drag races next Saturday and that I personally will win back our car from this Leadfoot Baylor by beating him at his own game.
Mm!
You're gonna build a car and race it at the drags?
Yeah.
That's the most ridiculous, preposterous idea I've heard in the last 150 years.
It's childish, idiotic and utterly fantastic.
When can you start on it?
First thing in the morning.
Good.
Oh, there's Uncle Herman and Grandpa again.
They've been pounding out in that garage every day for a week.
Don't you have any idea what they're up to?
No, I don't, and I really don't care.
I told Herman I wasn't speaking to him until he gets our family car back.
Well  But according to Eddie, they're building some kind of a car out there.
I don't know what they're up to.
They've asked Eddie for his bicycle.
They took the pipes out of the organ in the living room.
And Herman came back from the parlor with an empty box.
Now, you can't tell me that anyone can build an automobile out of junk like that.
Just a minute, now.
Okay, you can bring her out now, Grandpa.
Wow, what a rail.
!
I bet this Dragula can wipe anything on the strip.
I ask you is this an automobile, or is this an automobile?
I really got to hand it to you, Grandpa.
This is quite an attractive vehicle.
Detroit could take a lesson from this design.
And those organ pipes are a very nice exhaust.
"Nice"?
I'll have you know, Herman, that this is the only dragster in America that can play "Oh, Promise Me" in second gear.
Boy, I'm gonna go call Sandy's father and tell him we'll really beat him at the drags tomorrow.
Oh, goody, goody!
Uh, tell him we'll smear him.
D Wait a minute, Eddie.
Hold it, Herman.
Herman, come here.
Now.
One of the first rules in racing is never tip your hand.
What you do is, you show up the day of the races, get your rival to commit himself on the bet, then you unveil the winning car.
Is that good, clean sportsmanship?
Of course it is.
As Sonny Liston says, "It's not playing the game It's winning that counts".
"Born, 1367.
Died, question mark".
I must say, Grandpa, that's a very novel grill.
What do you mean, "novel grill"?
That's not a grill.
That's my license plate from the Old Country.
Isn't this a neat place, Mom?
Look at that guy go.
I must admit it's rather a fun place.
You know, Eddie, I used to be a great racing fan back in Transylvania.
Oh, I had such gay times going to the wolf track and betting on our relatives.
Grandpa, have you seen anything of our sporting rival, Mr. Baylor?
Hmm!
"Sporting rival".
Here comes that rat fink now.
Oh.
Well, Munster, back for another losing day at the drags?
Oh, no, sir.
Not today.
Uh, today, my decrepit, broken-down, old father-in-law is gonna blast your heap.
I got news for you, Munster.
I've been working on this tank of yours all week, and I got it up to where it will wipe out anything on wheels.
I see.
Uh, care to make a little wager on that?
What did you have in mind?
Same thing as last time.
Your car against ours.
Well, I don't know what you got under that canvas, but the bet's on.
Good.
Uh, allow me to introduce you to our new set of wheels.
Well, you still wanna tangle with us, buster?
Yeah, sure.
I mean, uh, I think so.
I never saw a rail like that before.
Just as I thought.
If you were any more chicken, Clyde, you'd be cackling.
That's enough, Herman.
Well?
All right.
You got yourself a bet.
I'll see you over at the start line.
Good.
Come on, Herman.
Hey, Leadfoot, they got a real bomb here.
What if old pop takes us?
Well, supposing he does?
It's gonna be real difficult for him to collect on his bet from the fracture ward, ain't it?
What do you mean by that?
Look.
This parachute is the only way they can stop this thing after the race is over.
If we kind of borrow it, wham, he hits the wall!
Get it out of here.
Oh, there's a seat, Aunt Lily.
Excuse me, sir.
Would you mind moving over one?
Oh!
Wasn't that nice of him to give up his seat for me?
Look, there's Grandpa at the starting line.
Oh!
Oh, my, he he's racing against our car.
I hope he wins and gets it back.
It's always been just like one of the family.
Hey, Leadfoot, the old boob hasn't even noticed his chute is missing.
Man, when he crosses the finish line, he won't stop till he hits Mississippi.
That's his tough luck.
Uh, just hold it a minute, Grandpa.
Herman, at a time like this you're taking pictures?
I just couldn't help it.
You look so natural sitting in that box.
Grandpa, you forgot your parachute.
Come on, Grandpa!
Oh!
Oh, I'm so nervous.
Eddie, stop biting your nails.
Oh, he won!
He won!
He won!
He won!
-  - Now, for the parachute.
Herman, son-in-law, baby, you saved my life.
Of course, Grandpa.
What else could I do?
I have to have this box back in the parlor first thing Monday morning.
It was very naughty of you, Herman, to lose our car at the drag races.
Thanks to Grandpa, we have it back now.
Lily, please, let's not bring up the past.
For once in this family, let's let the dead stay buried.
Good idea.
I just hope our car wasn't hurt in all those races.
Yes.
And it's a beautiful car.
Have you ever noticed the way everybody turns and stares at us when we drive by?
Lily, there's no harm done.
A little racing is good for a car.
It only serves to loosen up the engine.
Let's go, Pop.
We wanna get to the cemetery before all the good spots are taken.
Right, Eddie.
{END OF EPISODE 36}{START OF EPISODE 37}
Hey, Mom?
Where's Pop?
I wanna say good night to him.
He's not home yet, Eddie.
He's working late at the parlor.
Why can't he get home on time like other guys' fathers?
Now Eddie, you have to understand.
In his business, a lot of things won't keep till tomorrow.
Good night.
Good night.
It's a shame Uncle Herman has to work this hard.
They certainly take advantage of him down there.
Well, that's because he's so conscientious and faithful and loyal and What's that word?
- Stupid.
- He is not.
He sure is stupid.
He's a big lummox I don't see any reason why you should talk like that about Herman.
Grandpa, how can you say that about Uncle Herman?
- Hi.
-  Why don't you go on talking?
Why did you Why did you stop talking when I came in?
Never mind, Herman.
Well, when I come into a room, and everybody suddenly stops talking, it irks me.
It even makes me madder than when you start spelling out stuff.
We were just all upset about you working so hard.
Yes, dear, and for such a low salary.
Do you know what you're going to do first thing tomorrow morning?
Why, of course I do.
I'm gonna wake up.
You are going to wake up, and you're going to march straight into your boss, Mr. Gateman's office, and demand a raise in pay.
Lily's right, Herman.
Down at the parlor, why should you take things lying down?
Well, gee, I don't know.
I mean, I can't impose on Mr. Gateman.
He's been so kind to me.
He sent me that get-well card when I was hit by that diesel locomotive.
At Christmastime, he sent me that big basket of rotten fruit from California.
It was so thoughtful of him; I ate it all.
Now listen, Herman.
You're going to look Mr. Gateman straight in the eye.
You're going to pound on his desk, and you're going to ask for a raise in pay.
You're gonna be a regular tiger!
Well, all right, if you say so, dear.
I'll be a tiger.
Grandpa, don't scare a fella like that!
Never mind that.
What are you doing sneaking home in the middle of the day?
I was just hiding outside till Lily left the house.
What happened with Mr. Gateman?
I did just like Lily said.
I marched into his office.
I pounded on his desk, looked him straight in the eye, told him what a faithful employee I'd been and demanded a raise.
And, Grandpa, guess what?
He fired you.
How did you guess?
'Cause I know my son-in-law.
You're a hard-luck guy.
If you found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, there'd be a tax collector sitting on the lid.
What am I gonna tell Lily?
She's been counting on a raise, and if she finds out I've been fired, she might get mad at me and stamp on the floor and say mean things to me and shake her finger at me.
She might even break my Huckleberry Hound records.
Now listen, Herman, you're a grown man, and you're going to handle this in an adult manner.
You're gonna do what every red-blooded American husband does in a case like this.
Don't tell your wife a thing.
Well, Herman, all through dinner you haven't said a word about what happened at the parlor today.
Oh, uh, we were quite busy.
In fact, we had a quite a turnover.
I mean about your interview with Mr. Gateman.
Oh, that.
We're so anxious, Uncle Herman.
Did he talk to you?
Oh, yes, he, uh, talked to me.
Well, is he going to give you a raise or isn't he?
Well, you see, dear, Mr. Gateman is a rather busy man.
I think he wants to take the idea and sort of, uh, throw it down the well.
- Throw it down the well?
- You know, throw it down the well and see if anyone salutes it.
What kind of double-talk is that?
Well, you know, Lily, he wants to take the idea and run it up the flagpole and see if it makes a splash.
All businessmen have expressions like that to keep outsiders from finding out that they really don't know what they're talking about.
Well, I think Mr. Gateman is giving you the runaround.
He may want to think it over, but I want an answer by the end of the week.
Well, I think you'll have an answer by the end of the week if not sooner.
Marilyn, Eddie, come and help me take out the dishes.
Whew!
Boy, Herman, that was close.
But at least you've got till the end of the week.
I'll tell you what, Grandpa.
I figure I'll leave the house every day as if I was going to the parlor and not break the news to Lily until I get a new job.
Oh, I see.
You wanna keep the news from her as long as you can.
Right.
As we say in business, let's not start scratching till we know where the fleas are biting.
Well, here I go.
Off to bring home the bacon.
Of course, I've always been a hog for work.
Herman, it's been a week since you spoke to Mr. Gateman.
Do you think I'll have a little surprise tonight when I open your pay envelope?
Oh, yes, I think you'll have quite a surprise.
Oh, I just know it's going to be a real nice, big raise.
Well, Mr. Gateman should appreciate all the hard work you've done.
After all, anyone with his experience and all his years in the business should recognize a live one when he sees one.
Well, yes, dear.
Uh, good-bye.
I'll see you later tonight.
Well, Marilyn, we could certainly use a little extra money around here.
For one thing, Eddie needs a new cover for his bed.
The old one is getting so warped, he can hardly close it at bedtime.
Hey, Mom.
!
Mom.
!
Pop went off to work without his lunch box.
Oh, dear.
Well, thank you, Eddie.
Now go back to the kitchen and finish your breakfast.
Would you like me to drop it off on my way to class?
No, Marilyn.
I'll just call the parlor, leave a message for Herman with Mr. Gateman.
Oh, uh, Uncle Herman could eat in a restaurant today.
He says there's one around the corner that usually empties out whenever he gets there.
Hello.
Gateman, Goodbury and Graves?
This is Mrs. Herman Munster.
I'd like to leave a message for my husband.
You see, he He what?
When?
Are you sure?
Well I see.
Well, thank you very much.
Aunt Lily, what happened?
All the color's rushed into your face.
What happened?
Herman's going to work every morning this week has been a fraud.
The big goofball got fired last Monday.
What I want to know is what's Herman been doing this past week after he left the house every morning?
He's been out looking for work.
He's had five jobs in five days.
You can't ask for a better record than that.
He's a perfect failure.
I'm sure, Mr. Tom Fong, sir, if you'd consider hiring me, I'd live up to all your expectations.
I advertised "Boy Wanted".
You sure number one big boy all right.
Thank you.
Tell me, you ever work in laundry before?
No.
I, uh, I never have.
I thought maybe you got caught in mangle.
Hey, I betcha I know what happened, you rascal.
You have fight over girl, and boyfriend make you chop, chop, chop on the kisser.
I don't think so.
Uh, I mean, if anyone had gone chop-chop on my kisser, I think I'd be the first to know.
You know, I think you're gonna be all right.
You come over here.
I go show you something, learn you business upside down.
I go take you in the back room and show you modus operandi.
"Modus operandi"?
Yeah.
I "clue you in," Charlie.
Watch yourself.
Oh, boy.
Come here now.
Now you see I got here two machine.
That dryer, that one over there a washer.
You take the dirty clothes, you put in a washer.
When bell ring, you take wet clothes and you put in the dryer.
When this bell rings, you take out dryer, put in clean hamper, get more dirty clothes, put in washer.
You do same thing all the time, back and forth, back and forth, every time the bell ring.
You dig?
Uh, when bell ring on dryer, put dry clothes in hamper.
That good.
When bell ring on washer, put wet clothes in dryer.
Uh-huh.
Uh, then put more dirty clothes in washer.
Boy, you very good.
Now come here.
I show you more.
When you get all clothes, you bring over here and you iron.
Now, when you iron, no goof off.
You concentrate.
Don't worry, I'll use my head.
Oh, I don't know.
I think more better use iron.
More flatter.
You keep on do that till whole mess clean up.
You got it, Charlie?
Got it.
Now come here.
If you get in trouble any kind of trouble that emergency valve, you know?
And you turn emergency valve, that shut off everything.
You got it, Charlie?
Gotcha.
Good.
All right.
Oh, uh, excuse me, Mr. Tom Fong, sir.
But aren't you going to be here?
No, no.
I go lunch now.
I go down the street and get a enchilada.
Well, fine, but, uh, what should I do if a customer comes in?
Hide.
Grandpa?
Grandpa?
What is it, Lily?
Where are you going?
Out.
I'm just not gonna stand by and see my poor Herman buffeted and submerged by the cruel waves of misfortune.
"Waves"?
What happened?
Did the bum get a job as a lifeguard?
No.
He doesn't have any job.
And as his wife, I'm going to do something about it.
What can you do?
I can do what women have done for centuries.
"Women have done for centuries"?
I get it.
She's going to butt in and ruin his life.
?
This is the way we wash our clothes?
?
Wash our clothes Wash our clothes?
?
This is the way we wash our clothes so early in the morning?
?
-  - The bell.
Uh, when bell rings on dryer, put dry clothes in hamper.
-  - Bell.
But, l Oh.
Uh, when bell rings on washer, put wet clothes in dryer.
Now, put more dirty clothes in washer.
There.
That was easy.
Herman, you got it made.
-  - The bell?
Boy, that was quick.
-  -  -  -         Sprinkler system?
In other words, Mrs. Munster, you're asking me to reinstate your husband in our employ?
Oh, yes, Mr. Gateman.
Think of it.
He's been here for 17 years.
Why, your parlor has become his home away from home.
Really, uh, I'm afraid my mind is made up.
But you can't take all this away from him.
Herman's always been so happy among the flowers and the wreaths.
Surrounded by the restful strains of the organ music, doing the thing he loves best.
He was just saying to me the other night, "Lily," he said, "that place really grabs me".
Well, that's quite a compliment.
But he demanded an increase in salary.
I'm afraid down here we're not used to raising people.
?
This is the way we quit the job quit the job, quit the job?
?
This is the way we quit the job?
?
So early in the morning?
?
Oh, Mr. Gateman.
You must give Herman back his job.
He thinks of you not only as just an employer, but as a father.
I never told anyone this before, but, well, at home, he often refers to you as "Da-Da Gateman".
Really, Mrs. Munster?
Oh, I tell you I tell you, pussycat looks up to you the way Richard Chamberlain looks up to Raymond Massey.
Mrs. Munster, that's the nicest thing that anybody ever said to me.
I'll take him back and give him his raise.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Please, go now.
I mustn't cry anymore.
There's a big affair at the cemetery this afternoon I can't afford to show up dry.
Oh, thank you, you dear, sweet, kind man.
Um, we won't tell Herman that I talked to you, will we?
Oh, of course not, Mrs. Munster.
It's no use, Grandpa.
I've lost six jobs in the last five days.
I'm no good.
Even in the laundry business I'm all washed up.
That's right, Herman.
Your next step should be skid row.
But with PresidentJohnson wiping out poverty, a bum like you has got no place to go.
I shouldn't have been so cocky when I asked for that raise.
Fate has dealt me a deserving blow.
As has been said so many times, "He who blows his own horn only ends up with a fat lip".
After all, l  The bell!
The bell!
I gotta get the clothes out of the washer!
Will you take it easy?
It's only the telephone.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mr. Gateman.
Uh, sir, about the other day, I'm very sorry.
I had no intention of You want me to what?
Report for work in the morning?
You found you couldn't get along without me?
Well, I'll tell you, Gatey, old boy, I've had a few other offers, and I'd, uh, like time to consider what's best for me in this situation.
Oh, boy.
One minute he's Little Orphan Annie, the next minute he's Charles de Gaulle.
I can have my raise.
Oh.
Well, I guess under those circumstances, I would be willing to resume in your employ.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
You're very kind.
Oh, boy, Herman!
You got your job back and the raise.
What did you expect?
Oh, you're home, dear.
Herman, I found out all about your losing your job, and I want you to know that we're behind you a hundred percent.
Oh, yes, Uncle Herman.
We'll help you in any way we can.
Now, now, now.
That's not necessary.
It just so happens Mr. Gateman has just called and has begged me to come back.
Herman, you don't mean to tell me Of course, I insisted on the raise, but I knew sooner or later he'd come around.
Oh, Herman.
You're so forceful, and you're such a marvelous husband and father to your little brood.
You know, Herman, we look up to you to guide us and protect us against the trials and tribulations of life.
You have made right here at home our own ponderosa.
Aw, shucks, girl.
Uh, on top of that, I ain't never said a discouraging word.
{END OF EPISODE 37}{START OF EPISODE 38}
Oh, goody, hopscotch.
-  - Hello, mister.
Oh!
Hi there, young fella.
Is that some sort of game you're playing?
No, it's not a game.
I've got my head stuck in here.
Oh, my.
Well, uh, in that case, you should summon assistance.
- Huh?
- You know, call for help.
But I don't wanna do that, 'cause people would come and laugh at me.
And then my parents would find out and yell at me for being dumb.
Oh, yeah, I know.
That can be annoying.
Allow me.
There you go.
Golly!
That was real neat.
You must be the strongest guy in the whole world.
Well, with the possible exception of Li'I Abner.
- What's your name?
- Uh, my name's Mr. Munster.
But you can call me Uncle Herman.
My name is Galen Livingston Stewart, but you may call me Gale.
Oh, thank you.
Pleased to meet you, Gale.
It's been a pleasure saving your life.
Do you come by here every day?
Yes, I do.
- Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, that would be real boss.
Uh, that means "keen".
I just can't wait to tell my parents about you, Uncle Herman.
Good-bye.
Good-bye.
So, uh, Eddie, I said to Queen Isabella, "Why not give this Columbus cat the jewels?
"I mean, after all, they're not doing anyone any good lying around in the top drawer.
And besides, he might take a cruise and find something good".
And that, Eddie, is how Columbus discovered America.
Gee, Grandpa, you've had a lot of neat adventures.
Oh, yes, Eddie, over the centuries, you can say I got around.
A very interesting thing happened to me on the way home from work today.
Oh, that's fine.
Eddie, Eddie, don't just sit there.
Wolf down your food.
I was walking along the street today Grandpa, would you slice me another piece of meat?
Certainly.
Thank you.
It just so happens that today I saved a boy's life.
Mm, that's fine.
Oh, Grandpa, you're not eating.
Well, doesn't anyone want to hear about my heroic deed?
All right, Herman.
What did you do?
Yes, Herman, we're listening.
I just might not tell you now.
Good.
Pass the brussels sprouts, please.
Now wait a minute.
I'm gonna tell you what happened, and my whole family's gonna listen!
Including my rotten ol' father-in-law.
Okay, Pop, how did you save a boy's life?
Well, this boy had his head through an iron fence, and I unbent the bars and let him out.
Big deal.
Well, if I hadn't, his bones would have rotted right there on the sidewalk and hurt the neighborhood and brought down property values and everything.
So there!
Herman Munster, you are a plain, ordinary man in a plain, ordinaryjob.
Now why must you insist on these fantastic stories just to get attention?
But it's true, dear!
It-It's true.
I did save his life.
And his name is Galen Livingston Stewart, and he's my friend.
And I'm gonna meet him there tomorrow.
Herman, you and your stories.
Sometimes you act so childish, it's hard to believe you're 150 years old.
Galen Livingston Stewart, you and your stories.
Sometimes you act so childish, it's hard to believe you're nine years old.
But it did happen, Mom.
He did save my life, and he told me to call him Uncle Herman.
Just what did this Uncle Herman look like, son?
Well, he's about nine feet tall, and his head was flat.
He had these things sticking out of his neck.
His hands were sewed on to his wrists, and he's all green.
Galen Stewart, you get upstairs to bed this instant.
But it's true, Mom.
There is an Uncle Herman.
All right, upstairs, young man.
And I've warned you about telling these fantastic stories before.
Excuse me.
I ask you, John, where would Galen get these ideas about these weird-looking, frightening creatures?
I don't know, dear.
Maybe he spent too much time with your relatives.
There we are.
Hey, that looks pretty neat.
What is it?
What is it?
It's my old movie projector.
I got it out of the attic.
I'm gonna show some of my home movies.
I put a new motor in it.
That's great!
That's a 300-cubic-inch squirrel with overhead cam and hydraulic lifts.
How long have you been taking home movies, Grandpa?
All my life.
As a matter of fact, I was taking movies 300 years before the camera was invented.
- Gee, that must have been hard.
- Of course it was.
And I'll tell you something else.
There wasn't even a drugstore to develop the film.
Grandpa.
!
Eddie.
!
Is Herman down there with you?
No, Mom.
Grandpa and I are just goofin' off by ourselves.
Uncle Herman should be home by now.
I know.
But, you see, down at the parlor, they put him in charge of the complaint department.
He may be working late, straightening out a customer.
Boo!
Boy, Uncle Herman, I really scared you, didn't I?
Oh.
Oh, it's you, Gale.
I almost jumped out of my skin.
And in this cold weather, that can be very uncomfortable.
Say listen, Gale, I'm on my way home right now.
And I have a little boy at home just your age.
How would you like to come along and meet him?
That'd be great.
Oh, good.
Come on.
It's just a few blocks.
Oh, uh, just a minute.
Nothing, really.
Yoo-hoo, Herman's home!
Boy, this is the neatest house I've ever been in.
Oh, you're just saying that.
Come on.
Oh, there you are.
!
You have company.
Yes.
I would like you to meet Galen Livingston Stewart.
How do you Uncle Herman, is this your mommy?
Oh, heavens, no.
This is our poor, unfortunate niece, Marilyn.
The rest of the family's down in the dungeon.
Grandpa's going to show some home movies.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
Would you like to see them, Gale?
- I think that'd be a gas.
- Perceptive little fellow, isn't he?
After you, Marilyn.
Grandpa.
Grandpa.
Uncle Herman's here, and he's brought a friend.
Oh, dear.
I hope it's not another one of those stuffed shirts from the parlor.
Grandpa, Lily, Eddie, I would like you to meet the little boy whose life I saved and who will be eternally grateful  Galen Stewart.
Hi, Gale.
Hi.
Oh, hello.
Hello, little boy.
Hello.
Hiya, kid.
Now here, sit right down here, and don't make any noise during the movies.
Hmm?
Herman, please!
That's when I played the Loew's Palermo with my magic act.
I brought the house down every night.
Oh, I remember that.
That's the time with that backyard barbecue at Pompeii.
Things went a little out of hand.
Oh, look, Grandpa.
Those are the shots you took of King Arthur.
Yeah, he was mad at the Saxon gang for stealing the hubcaps off his chariot.
Boy, there was some rumble down at the old stone bridge.
A lot of water went under that bridge.
Yeah, and a lot ofknights too.
Oh, there are those two fun fellows, Burke and Hare.
I remember we were going out on a party, and they were trying to dig up a couple of friends.
There we are.
Typical Sunday traffic on the Appian Way.
L-I think the fellow on the left is looking for the off-ramp.
He never did find it.
Well, well, well, the old homestead.
Gale, that's where I spent most of my childhood, in three different jars.
Oh, dear, look.
!
There's my old music teacher before he went with Guy Lombardo.
Hejust disappeared.
No, I think he just took five.
And the house has trapdoors and secret panels.
And their little kid Eddie has fangs and pointed ears.
And his grandfather's about 400 years old and looks like Dracula.
I've never heard anything so ridiculous in my life!
And the mother has long black hair, and she's green like Uncle Herman.
And they've got a real, real neat pet, who lives under the stairs and breathes fire and smoke.
And they showed home movies of the burning of Rome and all that kind of stuff.
Out!
Huh?
I said out!
You get up to your room and don't you leave it until you're told.
But what if I get hungry?
Well, maybe your green Uncle Herman will come on over with a nice big, fat, juicy Dracula burger.
Charcoal-broiled by that pet that lives under the stairs.
Out!
Yes, sir.
John, what are we going to do about Galen?
His imagination is just fantastic, those ridiculous lies.
I don't know.
I think it's getting serious.
I think I'll have to take him to a good psychiatrist and see if he can't get to the bottom of these weird fantasies.
John.
Hmm.
Did you make up wild stories like that when you were his age?
Certainly not.
Well, I made up stories about Indians and people getting scalped and guys being eaten by cannibals, but I had a perfectly normal childhood.
?
?
What are you doing, Aunt Lily?
I'm filling the wastebaskets, Marilyn.
Oh, dear.
I hope I have enough trash to go around.
Well, the trashman will be here tomorrow.
I'm sure we can get by till then.
Hey, Mom, is Pop home from work yet?
Not yet, Eddie.
He'll be here soon.
Well, I want him to help me to find Spot.
He got out of his yard again.
Oh, dear.
The last time he got out, he went over to Grant Avenue and ate all the tops off the telephone poles.
Oh, Herman, there you are, dear.
Hey, Pop, have you seen Spot?
No.
And I didn't see Gale either.
I waited for him a half hour today, but he didn't show up.
I had to play two games of hopscotch by myself.
Well, may-maybe he had to stay after school or something.
No, dear, I'm afraid not.
I haven't seen him for three whole days.
I'm afraid he just doesn't want to see me anymore.
Oh, Herman.
You can't expect to be a big hero and save a boy's life every day.
Normal people like us just don't have exciting adventures all the time.
Well, my life is duller than most.
The most exciting thing that happened to me before this was 20 years ago, when a man stopped me on the street and asked me if I was voting for Alf Landon.
Well, d-don't worry about Galen, Herman.
You'll see him again.
He's probably at home now, playing with some friend who's more on his own age level.
Sure, Pop.
Come on and help me find Spot.
Well I think he'll come if you whistle for him.
All right.
Spot!
Here, Spot!
So, this, uh, playmate of yours, this Uncle Herman, is nine foot tall, he's all green in the face.
Und on top of his neck, his head is bolted on, ja?
Yes.
And he lives in a neat old haunted house with a dungeon.
And they have a real neat pet who lives under the stairs and breathes fire.
You see, Mr. And Mrs. Stewart, you have here a very intelligent boy.
He remembers all the details.
Now, young man, if you'll be so nice, you'll go upstairs to your room and wait.
Ja?
Good boy.
Stay away from the windows.
Uh, what do you think, Dr. Leinbach?
What do I think?
Well, I think Well, I think that the boy has obsessive juvenile fantasies, coupled with an overstimulated psyche.
In other words, he is creating a fantasy world of his own.
See, of course, in reality, we know that there is no nine-foot giant.
There is no haunted house.
There is no dungeon.
- You mean he makes it all up?
- Ja.
You see, the little Kind looks at nothing and sees something.
Looking at nothing and seeing something oh, oh, oh, that's bad.
Of course, looking at something and seeing nothing, that ain't so good either.
Well, what should we do, Dr. Leinbach?
Well, the first thing you've got to do is to get him to a doctor.
Well, that's why I called you.
Ja.
Now let me see if I can think of somebody.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?
I'm a doctor.
I'm a doctor.
I forget sometimes.
Uh, what do you suggest?
Ah, well, I think we have to rid the boy of these illusions by exposing them as false.
You see, now I, myself, will take little Galen personally by the hand to this fictitious house with these fictitious people, and then when he sees the reality that there is no such house and there is no such people, he's cured, ja?
Yeah.
Now, please, the boy from the room, call down.
Call Galen.
Galen, would you come down now?
Yeah, come on down, son.
You and me, we're going to take a little walk and meet your Uncle Herman face-to-face.
Ja?
Now none of that, Spot.
Sit!
Stay!
Now, Spot, cut that out.
That Spot.
Thanks for helping me find him, Dad.
Oh, that's quite all right, Eddie.
But you must remember to keep him chained in the backyard.
And we've got to break him of that habit of sneaking down to the wrecking yard and begging for leftovers.
Yeah.
Last week he got ahold of an old Edsel, and he was sick for three days.
Hey, Grandpa's taking his nap.
Would you come down in the dungeon and run some more of his home movies for me?
Sure.
Which ones would you like to see, Eddie?
Oh, how about the track meet in Transylvania you were in, when you were a young guy?
Oh, you mean that cross-country run?
Yeah.
You know, Eddie, I was so far ahead of the pack, the crowd had to run after me with torches to show me the finish line.
Come on.
See, Dr. Leinbach, there is too such a house.
Ja, ja, I see a house.
But I also know little boys.
You see an old, broken-down house, and you imagine that it's haunted with green men and dungeons and all sorts of crazy things.
But this is where Uncle Herman lives.
I want you to meet him.
Sure.
Sure.
Meet your Uncle Herman.
Go on.
We'll knock on the door.
Eh, nobody comes, see?
So I prove to you it's an empty house, and you forget all of this nonsense and we go home.
You forget all about it.
All right?
Come on.
Quiet.
Someone's coming.
Yes?
May I help you?
Excuse me, lady.
Uh, you live here?
Well, yes.
We've lived here for years.
Oh, why hello, Galen.
How are you?
Hi, Marilyn.
I brought a friend of mine over.
He wants to meet Aunt Lily, Grandpa, Uncle Herman and Eddie.
Oh, that's just fine.
They're all home.
Won't you come in?
If you'll wait just a minute, I'll tell Aunt Lily you're here.
Aunt Lily!
Aunt Lily?
You see, such a nice lady.
You wanna meet Spot?
Spot?
Spot?
What is a Spot, what?
Their pet who lives under the stairs.
I told you about him.
Oh, sure, sure.
Him I gotta meet.
Leinbach, you didn't see an animal.
In reality, you saw a gas pipe with a leak.
You understand?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Whoever saw a gas pipe with eyes and teeth?
Uh, may I help you?
Hi, Aunt Lily.
I brought a friend of mine over, Dr. Leinbach.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, excuse my appearance.
I was just getting some olives out of the jar.
If she was getting olives, I'd hate to see the martinis.
Uh, Marilyn said you wanted to meet the family.
Well, Grandpa's right in here taking his siesta.
Let me wake him up.
No, no, no, no, no!
Please, please, don't disturb him.
Oh, all right, but I'm sure he wouldn't mind.
He hangs around the house like this all the time.
Isn't this a neat place, Dr. Leinbach?
Where's Uncle Herman and Eddie?
Oh, well, they're both downstairs in the dungeon.
I'll get them.
Leinbach, get a grip on yourself!
You're seeing things the kid made up!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I know what it is.
I didn't wake up this morning.
I'm having one of them Freudian dreams.
Look at him.
Look at him.
Look at him hanging there like a bat.
He can't be real.
I'll pinch him.
No!
No!
No!
No!
No!
Oh, now here are my two boys now.
Hi, Gale.
Hi, Eddie.
Oh, hi, Gale.
How are you, son?
Oh, and who is this you brought with you?
Uh, Herman, this is Dr. Leinbach.
Oh, how do you do, Dr. Leinbach?
You are Uncle Herman?
- Oh, you're German?
- Ja.
Oh, by any chance, did you know my family doctor in Germany Dr. Frankenstein?
He made me what I am today.
Come on.
Come on, Leinbach.
Don't go to pieces.
Remember your training Now you know that what you are seeing over there doesn't really exist.
It's all in the mind.
It's nothing.
So, please, you're going to turn around and walk right through that Uncle Herman as if he was air.
That way you'll prove that he's nothing.
So come on, Siegfried, you can do it, huh?
Come on.
Oh, good heavens!
What happened?
That is the hardest hunk of nothing I ever saw.
Uncle Herman, I think I'd better take him home.
He looks like he might get carsick in the house.
- Oh, that's a shame.
- Stick with me, kid.
I'm a sick man.
Drop in anytime.
I don't know what kind of a doctor he is, but, you know, he oughta see a psychiatrist.
That's right, Mom and Dad.
We went over to that neat old haunted house.
Dr. Leinbach met Uncle Herman and the whole family.
Oh, now, Galen Now please, dear.
Please.
Galen, we believe you.
We believe that he met everybody and saw everybody.
He met and saw the pet that breathes fire, and the grandpa who sleeps upside down.
And the little boy with the pointed ears.
And especially green old Uncle Herman.
We believe you.
Now, you've had quite a day.
Why don't you go upstairs and take your nap.
Okay, Pop.
And thank you for believing about Uncle Herman.
That's all right.
John Stewart, what did you do that for?
What?
Now he'll go on believing in those stories he made up.
Oh, look, honey.
Today, a kid hasn't got very much he can believe in, in the way of fairy stories and giants and knights in armor.
Now if he's got a little Uncle Herman to believe in, let him hold on to it as long as he can.
Maybe you're right, dear.
Oh, by the way, Dr. Leinbach sent his nurse over today with his bill.
Well, he didn't waste any time, did he?
No.
But it's a funny thing.
A well-known doctor like that, writing his bills with a crayon?
