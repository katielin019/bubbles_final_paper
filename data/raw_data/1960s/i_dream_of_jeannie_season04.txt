{START OF EPISODE 01}
Ground Control, Jet Plate 1.
The aircraft's handling very well.
Circular thrust is okay, but it's not up to what I expected.
The engineers have to correct that.
All right, we're going to try the vertical descent now to check out the landing position.
Will confirm as soon as we're airborne again.
Jet Plate 1 over and out.
The interior cabin weight has increased by 109 pounds.
I won I wonder what that means.
Huh?
Let me check it out.
It means your scale is wrong, Major Healey.
I have never weighed more than 107 pounds in my entire life.
Jeannie, what are you doing here?
This is a top secret flight.
I know, master, and you must keep up your strength.
I brought your lunch.
Would you please, Jeannie.
Out.
It's peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
Yeah, I don't care what it is.
This is really important.
Now, you Wait Wait Wait a minute!
What flavor jelly?
Roger, stop that.
And you too, come on, get out.
Go on.
Yeah.
Boy.
Oh, boy, you were kind of tough on her.
She was only thinking of us.
Roger, when we get back to base I will personally buy you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
What flavor jelly?
Let's take her down, hm?
Hey, wait a minute.
This doesn't look like our touchdown point.
Huh?
You're right.
Jeannie's weight must have thrown us off course.
Let me check that.
All right, you take her down.
I'll handle this.
Aye, aye, sir.
Here we go.
All right.
Beautiful, Roge.
She handles like a dream.
Okay.
Go.
All right, you Martians, up with your hands.
Martians?
Well, that's ridiculous.
We're not Martians.
Eh!
Didn't expect you'd say you was, even if-in you are.
Paw, they're funnier looking than I thought they'd be.
Martians?
It's the flight suits, Roger.
Take off the flight suits.
Here, unzip I'm not taking my flight suit off in front of that girl.
Wait a minute.
Hey, lookit, Paw, they're shedding their skin.
Well, I'll be.
Sam hill.
Um Well, see?
Back, critters.
Unless you want more holes in you than a gopher field.
Oh, look, ma'am, I-I think you made a mistake.
Um, I'm Major Anthony Nelson and this is Major Roger Healey.
Eh, we're from Cocoa Beach.
Uh, uh, NASA.
Uh, we're astronauts.
What's an asternort, Paw?
I don't rightly know.
I reckon some special kind of Martian.
This one's kind of cute, Paw.
Can I keep him?
You get back here, girl.
You wanna get yourself corn-taminated?
You don't think they're gonna shoot us, do you?
No, of course not, Roger.
They're just simple country folk, Roger.
They're frightened.
I'll talk to 'em in their own language.
Yeah.
Good.
Uh, now looky here, folks.
There ain't nothing to rightly be feared How do you say "help" in hillbilly?
"Help".
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
What are you gonna do with them, Paw?
Well, I don't rightly know, Daisy Lou.
First thing we gonna do is move 'em over to the house.
Okay, Martians, get moving.
What?
What's the second thing you're gonna do?
Well, now, that's the part I ain't decided on yet.
I reckon we'll either shoot you or hang you.
Git!
Git!
Master.
Major Healey.
Hello.
Have you seen two astronauts?
Aw, yep, uh Paw's got 'em back to the house.
Oh, dear, I hope they aren't having lunch.
I don't reckon they are.
Hey, are you, uh?
Are you an asternort too?
Oh, no.
I am a genie.
Oh, I'm right pleased to meet you, Miss Jeannie.
My name's Clem.
How do you do, Mr. Clem?
You're purty.
Quick too.
I would like to see the two astronauts, please.
If'n I let you see 'em, then will you give me a kiss?
No, Mr. Clem, but I will give you a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Okay, okay, just put that thing down, will you?
Get in there.
I don't want any nonsense outta you two.
You made your mind up yet, Paw?
Yeah, are you gonna hang 'em or shoot 'em?
How many times do I tell you?
I'm not a Martian.
I-I was brought up in a farm.
I know all about barns, I Hang 'em!
Why are you doing that, Mr. Clem?
You were going to take me to see the two astronauts.
Oh, well, I aim to, uh, Miss Jeannie.
I aim to, you see.
But, um, us mountain folks has, uh, our own special way of doing things, and, uh, well, it wouldn't be fitting for me to take you over to see them fellas without I first showed you some old-fashioned mountain hospitality.
Is that what you were doing with them?
Oh, we sure are.
Heh, heh.
Well, all right.
I I do not wish to be impolite.
But But can you show me this hospitality quickly?
Miss Jeannie, I aim to be quicker than spit on the griddle.
Is this what you call hospitality?
Why, sure.
How about a little old-fashioned mountain-style bear hug?
Miss Jeannie!
Miss Jeannie!
Wait a minute.
Now, that's not what I meant.
I meant something entirely different.
There.
Reckon that ought to keep you Martians from trying any more funny stuff.
What can we do to convince you we're not Martians?
Could they be telling the truth, Paw?
Well, I reckon not, but there ain't no real way of telling.
Say, that gives me an idea.
Do Martians have blood?
Of course not, Maw.
Everybody knows Martians ain't got no blood.
And if'n they do, it's green.
Well, then, all we got to do is poke 'em a little with this, and if they bleed red, they ain't Martian.
I'm a Martian, I'm a Martian.
Martian.
Martian.
There, you see, Paw?
We got us a corn-fession.
Heh-heh.
Now, all you got to do is decide whether you wanna hang 'em, or Or shoot 'em.
Will you stop ogling him, Daisy Lou?
But he's cute, Maw.
I'm gonna give you cute right up alongside your head.
We ain't having no mixed marriages in our family.
I say we should shoot 'em and be done with it.
I reckon you're right, Maw.
Oh, Paw, don't shoot 'em.
Can't we keep 'em as pets?
I bet they'd pull a real good plow.
Daisy Lou, they is strangers.
And strangers mean trouble.
What if somebody was to find out about 'em?
They tell the government, the government tell the revenuers, the revenuers come poking around here and find our still.
Your Paw's right, Daisy Lou.
The only thing to do is shoot 'em.
Uh, ma'am, could I speak to you a moment, please?
Uh, I-I think I have a solution.
So have we.
Uh, but I think I can convince you that we're not Martians.
Oh, you can?
Uh-huh.
Now, if you'll just call Cocoa Beach.
You call NASA at Cocoa Beach.
They'll be able to explain who we are.
Can't do that, son.
And why not?
'Cause we ain't got a telephone.
Oh, yeah.
Ain't got a telephone.
Somebody must have a telephone around here.
Isn't there a town nearby?
We could go to Hankerville, Paw.
Yeah, reckon we could.
Say, um, uh, what's this fellow, "NASA"?
Oh, it's not a fella, sir.
It's the National Aeronautics and Space Agency.
The who?
Oh, um, the government.
Paw, you're right.
Revenuers!
Wait, put the down the gun.
Forget it, Roge.
Forget it?
They're gonna shoot us!
No, no, they just probably don't want the reward.
Maw.
Reward?
What reward?
Um, the United States government would be very grateful if you captured two Martians.
There would be a big reward.
Right?
Let's go to Hankerville.
We'll send Clem to Hankerville.
Remember: NASA.
Uh, Cocoa Beach.
Ask for Dr. Bellows!
Oh, don't ask for Dr. Bellows.
Forget Forget Dr. Bellows.
I sure don't know how you done this, Miss Jeannie, but I'd sure appreciate it if'n you'd let me down.
Well, I would be happy to, Mr. Clem.
But first you must promise not to chase me anymore.
Oh, I will.
I do.
I surely do.
And then you must promise to take me to see the two astronauts.
I will, I will.
Just as soon as you let me down from here.
Very well.
Mr. Clem, you promised.
I know I did, Miss Jeannie, but I'm a terrible liar.
Paw whups me for it all the time.
I just can't help it.
I just keep on lying.
Ah-haw!
What?
Clem, you get down from there.
Well, I don't rightly know how, Maw.
She done it to me.
I might have noticed.
Another Martian, but female.
I would like to see the two astronauts, please.
You watch out for her, Paw.
She's got powers.
Uh, well, why Why surely, ma'am.
Uh, you just follow me.
Oh.
Um Could you get him down from there?
'Cause he's gonna go to Hankerville.
Very well.
You tell him what to do, Maw.
Now, uh, ma'am, them other two Martians is out in the barn, so right this way.
Hey, that was a great idea about the reward.
I wonder how far it is from here to Hankerville?
I don't know, but here they come.
Oh, master, what have they done to you?
Would you please just blink us outta here.
Oh, yes, master.
At once.
Hey, that's real neat.
Sure saves us the trouble.
Heh.
Clem's on his way, Paw.
Say, you done her pretty good, Paw.
I've been thinkin'.
Them rewards you get for capturing people.
They say "dead or alive," don't they?
They sure do.
Uh-huh.
Yes.
Yes, well, thank you, colonel.
Nothing yet on Major Nelson and Major Healey, sir.
They were supposed to land and then confirm once they were airborne again.
It's, uh, been three hours.
Well, the radar lost them as soon as they started down.
They could be anywhere within a radius of 200 miles.
Well, according to  Oh, I'll get it.
Dr. Bellows speaking.
Uh, yes.
Just a moment.
For you, sir.
General Peterson.
Yes.
Henderson, I haven't got time to fool around any kind of nonsense like that.
I've an experimental ship with two astronauts down, and Yes.
Yes, I know.
All right.
I'll send somebody up there.
Major Nelson, Major Healey?
Martians.
I beg your pardon?
All those blasted UFO sightings.
Every time some darn fool sees a sunspot or a balloon, they think we're being invaded.
Perhaps Jet Plate 1.
It looks like a flying saucer.
That thought crossed my mind.
However, this time the report says the Martians have been captured.
Three of 'em.
One a female.
Well, that crosses out Major Nelson and Major Healey.
Nevertheless, space headquarters wants the invaders questioned and investigated.
Now, would you mind hopping up there, Dr. Bellows?
Yes, sir.
Jeannie, would you wake up?
Would you please wake up?
Oh!
Uh-oh.
You woke up the wrong girl.
Shoot.
Hi.
Hey, Martian.
How come you don't cotton to me?
I sure cotton to you.
You hear that?
She cottons to me.
What a time to be irresistible.
Roger, control yourself, will ya?
Just control yourself.
I know how unbearably beautiful you find her, but remember, you're a Martian.
She's She's an earthling.
It won't work.
What are you talking about?
I know, I know, I know.
The heartbreak, the pain.
The heartbreak and pain is hanging from this hook Roger!
You see, miss, us Martians, we don't show our feelings like most folks do.
But Roger here, well, he's just He's just plumb crazy about you.
Oh, he is?
Sure he is.
Ain't you, Roge?
Ain't you?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, me?
Boy.
Oh, I'm plumb crazy about you, ma'am.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
Here's what he'd really like to be doing with you now: Is holding you in his arms and crushing you and tell you how beautiful you are.
Yeah, I'd like to hold you and crush you and beautiful Yeah.
The thing is, you with that gun down there and us hanging up here, well, c'est la vie.
What's that mean?
In Martian that means he loves you.
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, c'est la vie.
C'est la vie.
C'est la doggone vie.
Oh, yeah.
Mmm.
Oh!
Wake up.
Wake up.
Would you just please wake up, Jeannie.
Jeannie, please wake up.
Please, come one.
Come on, baby.
Okay, put her down over here.
Over here.
Water.
I think she's coming to.
Water.
Jeannie, if you just wake up you could blink yourself Lake Michigan.
There's a bucket over here.
Oh!
It's got water in it.
Water.
There you go.
He said he was plumb crazy for me.
He even said he c'est la vied me.
He didn't.
Yes, and then he  Aw, hush up, Daisy Lou.
Hush up, will ya?
You reckon we gotta revenge her, Maw?
I reckon we do, Paw.
If'n we don't, we can't hold up our heads in polite society.
Well, uh, how about the reward?
Dead or alive, Paw.
Dead or alive.
Uh-huh.
Come on, gal.
Come on, Jeannie, we gotta get back to the jet plate.
More.
Come on, that's enough.
Ahem.
Ah, thank you, Master.
Wait a minute.
That's moonshine.
Great, just what we need: A stoned genie.
Jeannie.
Oh!
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Tag!
Agh!
You are it, master.
Catch me, catch me.
Oh, tag.
Yeah.
All right, Jeannie.
Oh, ooh, oh!
Come on.
Come on, Jeannie!
Will you stop that?
Do you happen to know what this stuff is?
Very good, master.
I am it.
I will catch you.
Good idea.
Roger!
Roger.
Come on.
Olly, olly oxen free-free-free.
Oh, that is not fair, master    Jeannie, just one blink to the jet plate.
Please, just one blink.
Oh, now we're really up a tree.
If that is your pleasure.
How's this?
Oh, great.
Where'd they go?
There they are.
Now we're really sitting ducks.
Certainly.
Roge, you've got feathers and wings.
So have you.
You wanna fly south for the winter?
Darndest thing I ever seen.
Ah, what'd you expect, Paw?
It's just your average, everyday Martian.
Jeannie, blink us to the jet plate right now.
The jet plate, the ship, the airplane, the round thing.
Well, certainly.
Why did you not say so before?
I did say so before.
Ah!
We're here.
We're safe.
Well, thank you, Jeannie, thank you.
Oh, I've never been so happy to be anyplace in my whole life.
All right.
Let's get outta this nightmare.
Come on.
Are we not gonna play tag anymore?
Oh, what have you done now?
!
Jeannie, are you all right?
Let me check that.
It's all right, Roger, it's just the capacitor.
It'll take a minute to fix.
For the last time, that is not a flying saucer.
It's a jet plate.
An experimental aircraft constructed by the United States Air Force.
Please, please, will you take me to the astronauts.
It's Dr. Bellows, all right.
Oh, Jeannie, come on.
We need you.
Wake up.
She must be out for the duration.
Dr. Bellows must be worried about us.
We'll go out and show him we're okay, and then try to keep those people from thinking we're Martians.
You are Martians.
Yes, master.
If they ain't Martians, do we still get a reward?
If'n they ain't Martians, Paw, can I marry the cute one?
You'll wait till you're 14 like your sister done.
Please, please, just take me to them.
Not till you give us the reward.
My dear sir, I appreciate you informing NASA of the whereabouts of the jet plate, but it seems to me that any public-spirited citizen should be only too willing  Great heavens.
Martians.
I've gotta get back to I've got to NASA Invaded.
Hey, wait.
Wait a minute.
Hey, mister.
Hey.
Hey, mister.
Wait a minute.
These here are not the same ones.
No, they's different.
Hey, wait a minute.
You can't shoot at Dr. Bellows.
He's a psychiatrist.
He's right.
We're Martians.
Here, here.
Get 'em, get 'em.
General, I don't understand.
This whole base should be on red alert.
The president should have been notified.
Look.
Look at this hat.
Now just calm down, colonel.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
But, sir, I know it sounds crazy, but it's true: I saw them.
Green Green men with, uh:  Antennae, colonel?
That's right, sir, antennae.
They must have taken over the jet plate.
Well, there's the jet plate right now, doctor.
The gall of them, to come right here to NASA.
Oh, no.
They might have vaporizers.
We'll chance it, doctor.
Go on!
You'll see.
You'll see.
Hello.
Hello in Hello in there.
Uh, we are earthlings.
We like you.
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
We like you too.
Well, doctor?
Well, I I tell you, sir, I saw Martians.
They were green with these long antennae.
I saw them.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Thank you.
All right, when I count three, you let it down Uh, take it out.
Yes, master.
One, two Three.
Oh.
I will get it.
No, no, no.
I'll get it, I'll get it.
Talk about air mail.
I think it's for you.
Oh!
It is from my mother.
I think I know what it is.
Uh, Jeannie.
Uh, Jeannie, do me a favor.
Would you ask your mother to go through the normal channels when she mails things?
I really don't think my neighbors could understand us getting parcels on On magic carpets.
Yes, master.
Ooh!
I was right.
Pipchicks.
Yeah?
Pipchicks.
My favorite candy.
And no one can make them like my mother does.
Mmm.
Try one, master.
No, thanks.
If your mother made them, I'd really rather not Oh, please, master.
Here, try one.
You'll adore them.
Mmph Well?
Well, good.
It's great.
What'd she put in 'em?
I do not know.
It is my mother's secret recipe.
She will not tell anyone.
You thank her the next time you see her.
They're really sensational.
I will, master.
I am delighted you like them.
Well, there we are.
Is that all you're having for lunch?
Yeah, I'm not terribly hungry.
Oh, what's the matter, aren't you feeling well?
Ha, I never felt better in my life.
I'm just making a note to send Jeannie's mother a little something.
I thought you two hated each other.
How could you hate anybody that makes these?
Look.
What are those?
Pipchicks.
Oh.
Uh, Roge, I'd rather you didn't eat any.
They have kind of a strange temporary side effect.
Then why are you eating it?
It's got a fantastic taste.
They're really sensational.
Hello, ah, Major Nelson, Major Healey.
Mind if I join you?
Of course not, sir.
You know, uh, about that inside report that we had the other day.
I think we'll have to do some more research.
You see, four pages would do it, if Mmmmm.
Delicious.
Simply delicious.
I've never tasted anything quite like it.
Did you eat one of those, sir?
Yes.
Well, where can you buy them?
Uh, well, you You can't, sir.
They're They're homemade.
Who made them?
Jeannie's mother.
Oh.
Sorry, Roge.
Um, I did, sir.
I just kind of whipped 'em up in the kitchen.
Remarkable.
Well, then, uh, you won't mind if I take this other piece.
That one's my last one, sir.
I Oh, come, come, come, major.
You can always whip up another batch.
Oh, uh, have some more coffee Extraordinary.
Absolutely extraordinary.
Extraordinary.
You know, this has got to weigh 300 pounds.
Oh.
I feel absolutely marvelous.
Major, I don't know what's in this, but whatever it is, I'm going to take it to the lab to have it analyzed.
They're not making cafeterias like they used to.
You're right, Roge.
There's nothing wrong with making candy.
I don't have anything to worry about.
Nothing Major Nelson, do you know what you've done?
If it's what you found in the pipchicks, sir, I can explain about it.
I don't The Dietician Section has finished the analysis of your candy.
Colonel Finch is on the way over now with the results.
Well, I'd better be running along.
I can explain that.
I know exactly Don't any of you come to attention when a superior officer enters the room?
I'm sorry, colonel.
I didn't, uh, see you.
And are you nearsighted too, Dr. Bellows?
I beg your pardon?
Dr. Bellows.
I believe I became a full colonel four days before you, so I outrank you.
Attention.
That's the trouble with you men.
You can't get used to women in positions of authority.
All right, at ease.
Nelson.
Ma'am.
Come here.
Pick me up.
I didn't catch that, ma'am.
I said, pick me up.
Pick you up?
Sorry, ma'am.
Mm.
When was the last time you had a piece of your candy?
This morning, colonel.
That explains it.
The initial effects wear off immediately.
It certainly does.
Ha-ha-ha!
Healey.
Yes, sir.
Come here.
Yes, sir.
Yes, colonel.
What?
What is here, Colonel?
Put your hands over your head.
Yes, sir.
Now watch this.
Whoa.
Extraordinary.
See, very simple.
There's nothing to it.
Well, I I better be getting back to my office.
Excuse me.
Absolutely extraordinary.
I took a bite of the candy just before I came in here.
Nelson, do you realize what you've done?
I've created a monster.
You have single-handedly solved the space capsule food problem.
You mean that Major Nelson's homemade candy could be used in space flights?
Oh, well, I don't think it'd work, sir.
What I mean is, it was an accident.
What is the recipe?
Oh, well, there's no recipe.
No, well, you know how us old-fashioned cooks work.
A pinch of this, a handful of that.
Do you mean it's not written down?
No, sir.
Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.
I I'd never be able to do it again.
That's where you're wrong, Nelson.
You're going to do it again, and you're going to write it down.
Do you read me?
Yes, ma'am.
Doctor, I want this man transferred to the Dietician Section immediately.
And he'll remain there until these These, um Eh, what do you call them, major?
Pipchicks.
Until these pipchicks have been duplicated exactly.
Well, ma'am, I can't do that.
I'm preparing for a mission.
Nelson.
This is much more important.
Why, this has worldwide implications.
You don't seem to realize what a breakthrough this is.
The Army may march on its stomach, major, but from now on, the Air Force will fly with pipchicks.
But, Mama, I must have the recipe.
It's for him, isn't it?
My poor baby.
My poor darling Jeannie, always in trouble.
Always in trouble.
That bum.
Spending his time up in space.
What kind of a living is that for a grown man?
Mama.
Aha-ha!
I knew it.
I knew it.
Oh, my poor darling.
If you could just give me the recipe?
Eh.
Who uses a recipe?
A pinch of this, a handful of that.
I All right.
All right.
It is for him, isn't it?
Yes, Mama, and he needs it desperately.
Hmmm.
And I'm going to give it to him.
That's the recipe?
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
I It's very complicated, sir.
And there's no guarantee that the pipchicks will come out the same way.
It doesn't matter, major.
NASA has given this project the highest priority.
The resources of the entire base are at your disposal.
"Three heskils of dates"?
So, what's a heskil, major?
Four truckloads.
Four truckloads?
Why, major, are you planning to make enough pipchicks to feed the entire population of India?
Oh, no, sir.
You see, this recipe only makes about two dozen.
Sir, I I'd appreciate it if you had a little talk to Colonel Finch about having me relieved from this assignment.
I'm sorry, major.
You know how important the space capsule food program is.
Yeah.
"Three hipsibahs of oranges"?
Half an acre.
Half an acre?
Why, that's impossible, major.
Well, I know that, sir.
That's why I'd like you to talk with Colonel Finch.
Well, I certainly will.
I never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life.
A half an acre.
I'll have you relieved immediately.
Were you looking for me, doctor?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I was, colonel.
Major Nelson was just showing me the recipe for the pipchicks.
A half an acre of oranges, and I And?
And he'll report to the kitchen immediately.
Good.
Thanks for getting me assigned as your assistant.
There's nothing I'd rather do more than pit dates.
Well, men?
Roger How are we doing?
Well, I've never had so many dates in my life.
Ha-ha-ha!
Well, ahem, that's the last one we needed.
What do we do with these now?
Throw 'em away.
We use the pits.
We can use the pits?
I can't keep this up much longer.
My back is breaking.
Oh, don't worry.
I'll relieve you in another five minutes.
Oh.
Good evening, master.
How is the?
The little old candy maker?
Oh, just great.
Your mother can certainly figure out some wild recipes.
I tell you Oh, boy, I W-what's the matter?
Oh, it's my back.
It's breaking.
Oh, let me help you, master.
Oh.
What is that?
I don't know, it's not in the recipe.
Thank you.
Jeannie, get out.
Oh, yes, master, I am going.
You forgot the burro.
Jeannie?
A burro.
What's that burro doing in here?
Well, sir, the recipe called for a burro to, uh, stir this mess, so naturally, I got a burro.
This laboratory is supposed to be completely sterile and antiseptic.
Now you get this beast outta here.
I can't get him outta here, sir.
What seems to be the problem, major?
Oh, a donkey.
Oh, I I-I'm sorry about this, colonel, but, um, uh, Major Nelson insists that the pipchick mixture be stirred by this burro.
I just insisted that they get rid of it.
Negative.
If Nelson says it's to be stirred by a burro, it's to be stirred by a burro.
Look, I, uh, oh, uh, eh, yes.
Uh Ooh.
I'd prefer we test it on something else.
May  Oh, excuse me.
Yes?
Oh, hello, Amanda.

Please, eh, sir, I'd rather we test it on a dog, or Well, I don't care what kind of detergent you're using.
No, no, no.
Cats don't shrink.
They only look shrunk when they're wet.

Major, will you stop this?
This is embarrassing and personal.

Now would you mind leaving, please?
Yes, of course.

Dominate me!
I've always wanted to be dominated!
Oh, what happened to her?
She What happened to her?
She ate one of pipchicks, that's what happened to her.
She had some kind of a wild reaction.
Now you hang onto her.
I'll get Dr. Bellows.
Excuse me, ma Dr. Bellows.
I gave Dr. Bellows a pipchick.
I gave Dr. Bellows a pipchick!
No!
Major.
Oh.
Major, I never realized what beautiful blue butterfly eyes you have.
Major.
Major.
Major.
Please.
We're both officers.
Oh.
Hi.
Way, hey Blow the man down Ahoy, there.
Come aboard, major.
Ha-ha-ha.
Come outta the water.
I beg your pardon?
The water.
Oh!
Did you eat the pipchicks, sir?
I certainly did.
Salt air gives you a marvelous appetite.
Ready to come about.
Come aboard.
Look out for the boom, major.
The what, sir?
The boom!
Oh.
Oh, right, right.
Ah, sir, I I really think you ought to come with me.
Come with you?
What for?
I'm finally doing something I've always wanted to do.
Sailing a whaler to Alaska.
Mmm.
Looks like a sou'easter's blowing up outta the nor'west.
Ah, you gotta watch out for them sou'easters.
Perhaps we ought to go below and put on our foul-weather gear, sir.
Too late for that.
Lower the lifeboat.
The what?
The lifeboats, the lifeboats.
Oh.
A-roving, a-roving Since roving's been My ruin I'll never go a-roving With you, fair maid A-roving, a-roving Since roving's been My ruin I'll never go a-roving With you, fair maid Welcome aboard, commodore.
Ahoy, there!
When I was  Listen, I found out what these pipchicks do to you.
They release your inhibitions.
They They turn you on to whatever you are really deep down inside.
Look at Look at Colonel Finch, she wants to be a butterfly.
That's what she is.
She's a butterfly.
A-and Dr. Bellows.
He wants to be a sailor hunting whales.
You understand?
You're sloppy, soldier.
The one thing I can't stand is a sloppy soldier.
You should read the Air Force manual more often.
Roger, did you eat one of those pipchicks?
Positive.
Proper diet is crucial to an officer's efficiency.
Regulation 94R21.
Are there any more of those things left?
You didn't eat all of them, did you?
You didn't eat all of these, did you?
Negative.
Sent to General Peterson's office for dispersal.
All superior officers should be informed on completions of new projects.
Regulation 94-21.
You sent 'em to General Peterson?
You sent 'em to General Peterson?
!
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
No, that's too slow.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Argh!
I am here, master.
Are your pipchicks finished?
Are they finished?
I'm finished.
Look.
No dancing.
The regulations book says no dancing.
Oh, dear.
Yeah.
What went wrong?
I'll tell you what went wrong.
Your mother, that's what She did this deliberately.
W-would you please blink them outta that?
Oh, of course, master.
Heh-heh.
Well, go ahead.
Salute.
Always salute when rowing.
Sir, you're out of uniform.
I said Oh, dear.
"Oh, dear"?
Listen.
You go back to your mother and you ask her what this is all about.
You find out what this is, and you get an antidote.
I've gotta go to General Peterson before this whole base goes berserk.
Yes, master.
Yeah.
And furthermore, you tell your mother Oh.
You mean, you ate one of those things and nothing happened?
Why, of course not, except I never felt better in my life.
Why, you've done a marvelous job, major.
Oh.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Uh, what'd you do with the rest of them?
I sent a dozen to Washington, the president, the vice president.
The joint chiefs of staff would be most interested.
How did you send them, sir?
By the regular NASA mailbox.
What's the matter with you?
You look as if you're about to collapse.
Sir, those pipchicks have a very strange side effect.
People's inner personality come to the surface.
Well, that ridiculous.
They haven't done anything to me.
I have Colonel Bellows, Colonel Finch and Roger Healey locked up in the laboratory right now.
If the inner personalities of the people in Washington come to the surface Good heavens.
Get to the NASA mailbox, major.
I'll try to stop it from here.
Right, sir.
I-I'm glad to see they didn't have any effect on you.
I'm all right.
Good, good.
Oh, hi.
Tony.
Charge!
Indians.
Indians all over the place.
We gotta protect the fort.
That way, paleface.
Oh.
Charge!
Get those Indians.
General, general.
Here, this way, sir.
Sitting Bull, I'm gonna get you for what you did to Custer.
A-roving, a-roving General, this way, sir.
Sitting Bull's right in there, sir.
Mailbox.
Mailbox.
Oh!
Hello, master.
What has happened?
Oh, nothing much, Jeannie.
Let's see: Uh, Colonel Finch is a butterfly, Colonel Bellows is out hunting Moby Dick, General Peterson is trying to revenge Custer, and our swinger friend Roger is Captain Bligh.
How's your mother?
Oh, she's just fine.
Thank you, master.
Heh, heh.
Right, yeah.
But I am afraid she gave you the wrong recipe.
No kidding, yeah.
Listen, there's a parcel of pipchicks on its way to the Pentagon.
Pick it out of there.
Oh, that is easy, master.
No, not here, not here.
Well.
Hi.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Look, there's no time to play games.
Where are you, anyhow?
I am here, master.
In the mailbox.
Look, find the package.
Get the package.
The parcel.
Yes, master.
Oh!
No, no.
Not Not letters.
Not letters.
The package.
The parcel.
Yes, master.
I am looking.
I am looking.
You will have to take some of these, master.
I cannot see what I am doing.
Oh.
Here it is, master.
Oh, it is all smashed.
Well, blink it out.
Oh, I could not do that, master.
After all, it is Mama's magic.
All right, well, then hand 'em up one at a time.
Oh, master.
I told Mama you were the most intelligent astronaut of the whole group.
She did not believe me, but I will convince her some day.
Jeannie, will you?
Oh, yes, master.
Right away, right away.
Look, uh, I haven't got all day.
Will you hurry it up, please?
Hi.
How are you?
No Yes, as a matter of fact.
You know, I've always admired you mailmen.
Through sleet and snow, hail and rain, the mail must meet its appointed rounds.
And there Excuse me, I'm a little late.
Relax, take it easy.
You're in the service, I'm in the service.
Maybe we chew the fat, learn how each other operates.
Major, you're interfering with U.S. mails.
Of course not.
I use the U.S. mails all the time, watch.
I'll show you how easy it is.
Master.
There someone in there?
No, of course not.
You can't go around mailing people.
Oh, sorry.
Jeannie, will you hurry it up?
Will?
Oh.
Major.
Are you all right, major?
Major?
I'm all right.
Thanks.
Thanks.
What's going on here?
Let us out.
Let us out.
Somebody unlock the door.
I still don't know what I'm doing in here.
I don't even know how we got here in the first place.
We We must have been attacked.
I can't think of any other reason I'd be out of uniform.
Last thing I remember, Major Nelson came into my office.
Of course.
Major Nelson.
He'd have an explanation, sir.
He always does.
Don't anybody panic.
Major Nelson.
Don't anybody panic.
Ladder Company Number 69 to the rescue.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Good morning, Major Healey.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Would you get the newspaper for me, please?
Oh, sure.
You're just in time to join us for breakfast.
Oh, it's not there.
Uh, I'm not hungry, Jeannie.
I'd just like a cup of coffee and some eggs Florentine.
No morning newspaper.
Oh, my master will be very annoyed.
Well, that should be easy for you: A newspaper.
Why don't you just give it the old blink?
Oh, of course.
Why did I not think of that?
Uh, what is today's date, Major Healey?
Uh, today is the 17th.
Mm, 17th.
Very good.
Nice.
Heh.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Roge.
How are you?
You're not dressed?
We're gonna be late for the you-know-what.
Excuse me.
Late for the what?
I'm going to Florence to get your eggs.
To Florence?
What do you have to go to Floren?
What are we supposed not to talk about?
You know, top secret.
Boom, pow.
Top secret.
B Oh, oh, oh, yeah.
Boom, pow.
You mean the capsule-seat ejector test.
Shhhhh!
The capsule-seat ejector test.
NASA let out the news to all the newspapers.
It's gonna be, um It's gonna be tomorrow, Roger.
The 17th.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
Tomorrow's the 17th?
That's right.
Oh, that's the last time I buy a calendar watch with Roman numerals.
Look, we got t We've got today off.
Sit down.
Have a little breakfast, huh?
Oh, with a day off, who wants to?
Listen, I got things to do.
You know, a little ahem.
Oh, yeah.
Okay.
Good hunting.
Oh, uh, can I borrow your sports section?
Sure.
Bye.
Where's Major Healey, master?
I have his eggs.
Oh, uh, well, he went hunting.
Well, let's see what the good news is.
Hey, what's this all about?
Hm?
What is that, master?
Take a look at the headline.
"Astronaut breaks leg in accident".
Yeah.
Well, who broke his leg?
NASA is withholding the name of the injured astronaut.
Why should they say such a thing?
They even goofed up on the date.
It's not the It's not the 17th.
Today's the 16th.
Are you all right?
Jeannie, what's the matter?
The 16th?
Oh, master, then it will happen.
Well, not to me, it's not gonna happen.
I don't intend to break my leg just to make some phony headline come true.
Oh, but, master, it is not phony.
It is real.
You are reading tomorrow's paper.
Oh, master, are you all right?
This is tomorrow's paper?
Eh, Jeannie, is this another one of your tricks?
Oh, no.
No, master, I promise.
I promise.
It was just that this morning there was no morning newspaper, and I asked Major Healey for the date, and And he looked at that cockeyed calendar watch of his, and told you it was the 17th.
Tomorrow.
Ah, ha, ha, no.
How about that?
Wait, wait, wait.
I know.
I will change tomorrow's newspaper back to today's.
Wai Jeannie, that's not gonna change the facts.
If it's gonna happen, it's gonna happen.
Ooh, well perhaps.
But I will not let it happen to you.
Oh  Hey, Jeannie, what are you doing?
I'm going to protect you.
Oh, I-I appreciate what you're doing very much, but you're forgetting one thing.
What?
Well, the newspaper didn't tell which astronaut was injured.
It might well be Roger Healey.
Oh, you are right, master.
Poor Major Healey.
You stop that.
He's your friend as much as mine.
We You gotta protect him, Jeannie.
Now let's go.
Don't you think it might be a little conspicuous if I try to find him in this, huh?
Perhaps you are right, master.
I will think of something else.
Okay.
Ooh!
Oh, no!
Are you all right?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Oh, dear me.
Look, uh, I gotta get dressed.
What?
To save time.
Oh, thanks.
Come on.
Do not run.
What?
Your leg.
Your leg.
Yeah, oh, uh, Roger will probably go to the base to pick up his mail.
We'll go there first.
I know.
Huh?
Nothing.
Oh.
Is he not beautiful?
No.
He will protect you.
Yeah oh.
Jeannie, what?
Well, he's much safer than a car.
I don't have a license to drive a camel.
Well, Dr. Bellows, these fitness reports on Majors Nelson and Healey are impressive.
Very impressive.
I think you'll find they're both in top physical condition.
Excellent.
Then I'll get over there now and, uh, help them check out that new cockpit harness equipment.
I'm afraid they're not here, commander.
I insisted that they stay away from the base today to, uh, relax.
Oh, of course.
That 24-hour period before flight time can Can be a bind.
Well, you should know, commander.
Heh.
You've been up there enough times yourself.
What the?
Doctor Bellows?
Are you all right?
Uh, yes, sir.
Except I just saw Major Nelson arriving in an armored truck.
Oh.
You what?
Incredible, isn't it?
Yes.
Yes.
Mm, it's very incredible.
Uh, Dr. Bellows, I think when I come back I would like to look at your fitness report.
The paper.
You wait here.
I'll run in and find Roger.
Oh, please do not run, master.
You may trip.
What if I do?
I hope I trip over Roger.
Don't run!
M-Major Nelson.
Ah.
Good morning, commander.
Ah, I'm in kind of a hurry.
I didn't see you.
You're in a hurry?
Yes.
Hope you'll excuse me.
It's kind of urgent.
Excuse me.
Yes, I'll, uh I'll I'll see you tomorrow at the test.
Come in.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Sir, uh, I'm looking for Healey.
It's an emergency.
Emergency?
Is Major Healey in some kind of trouble?
Well, not yet, but I, well I The accident could happen to him.
Of course, the accident could happen to me.
Accident?
What accident?
I don't know.
It hasn't happened yet.
It hasn't happened yet.
Yes.
Of course.
Well, I'd feel terrible if I didn't have a chance to warn him, sir.
Uh, so you'll excuse me.
I-I've gotta go look for him.
Just a minute, major.
Why don't you just lie down here on the couch?
Huh?
Hm?
Oh, I really would like to lie down, sir, but I just don't have time.
It'll only take a minute or two.
I'll just take your newspaper, huh?
Not my paper.
Calm down, major.
I was only trying to make you feel more comfortable.
Yes, of course, sir.
Believe me, I'd be much more uncomfortable without this.
Oh?
You feel a sense of security in holding onto a newspaper, do you?
No.
Well, uh, with this particular paper, yes.
How do you feel about magazines?
Oh, very good.
Very good.
Uh, doesn't grab you, huh?
Never mind.
Now, tell me, major um, you evidently feel that something's going to happen to you or Major Healey, and you feel you can predict it in advance.
Is that correct?
Psst, master, what is taking so long?
Shut up.
I beg your pardon?
Yes.
Yes, I think I can.
No one can predict the future, major.
Um, sir, could we discuss this at another time?
I really have to talk to Major Healey.
Uh, Roger's in kind of a Major Healey is perfectly all right.
It's you I'm worried about.
Now, you're just gonna stay on this couch until you learn there's no such thing as clairvoyance.
Premonitions are only for the ignorant and the superstitious.
Yes, sir.
Uh Uh, what would you say, sir, if I told you that I had a premonition that if you sat on that chair, it would collapse?
Heh.
It would only prove my point.
It's, uh It's brand new chair.
It's, uh, solid oak.
Incredible.
Yes.
I'm sorry about this, sir, I-I It was just a little Eh!
Perhaps if you would, uh, like to investigate it more, I could get involved with it.
And, uh, if I had more time, I could tell you more.
Excuse me.
But it was a brand new chair.
Hi, Marty.
Look out!
Major Nelson!
Major.
Hold on, hold on.
I'll, uh Get an ambulance!
Just move that jeep.
Major, go now!
Are you sure you're all right, major?
Yes, I'm fine, sir.
Look.
I guess I'll be able to take you for the rest of your tour around NASA headquarters.
Jeannie, what did you do to my leg?
Feels like iron.
Oh.
Not iron, master.
It is stainless steel.
My leg.
Oh, my poor leg.
Ow!
Ow.
Oh, oh.
Oh, that's enough, Sam.
Oh, the cramp's gone.
I'll get your shoulder here.
Oh.
Oh, yeah, that feels good, Sam.
Oh, yeah.
Major Healey.
Yeah.
I was wondering if you sometime play the horses.
Oh, I dabble a bit in it, but nothing serious.
Why?
There's a good hunch bet running today.
Yeah?
Flying Capsule.
Ah.
Uh, 20-1 and Ah!
Ooh!
Oh, that's good, Sam.
Oh, that's good.
All right, I'm gonna jump in the shower.
But look, I got the sports section in my locker.
I'll, uh, check it out.
Flying Capsule?
That's right.
Yeah, thanks, Sam.
Whoo!
Hot in there.
His housekeeper said they went to the health club.
Oh, that is good, master.
He should be safe in a health club.
Oh, yeah?
Did you ever try to pick up a bar of soap on a slippery shower-room floor?
What did he say, Flying Capsule, huh?
Flying Capsule, let me see.
Flying Capsule.
Eh, must be scratched.
Let me see Well, I'll be.
Flying Capsule pays 53.20.
Major, find out which race my hunch is in?
Yeah, I found out, all right.
Hah.
It's in the sixth race, only Only yesterday.
Yesterday?
Yeah.
Major, I don't know where you're getting your information.
That horse didn't run yesterday.
Are you kidding?
There are the results.
Right there.
Look, today's paper.
That says the 17th.
Today's the 16th.
Somebody's putting you on, major.
Gotta watch it.
Ha, ha.
Better watch it.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh, I gave Jeannie the wrong date.
Oh, is Tony gonna be mad at me.
Tomorrow's paper.
Tomorrow's paper!

I got tomorrow's paper.
Gotta get there before the first race.
Oh, am I gonna win.
I'm a winner!
Oh, am I.   Big trouble.
Roger's at the racetrack.
Why are we in trouble, master?
Is a racetrack dangerous?
It is for Roger.
He took the sports section with him.
Oh.
I do not understand.
Roger took the sports section from the newspaper this morning.
It carries the racetrack results.
He knows the All the winners in advance.
Oh, is that not nice.
He will be able to win much easier that way.
Yeah, but it's wrong.
It's, uh It's like stealing.
What did I do with that key!
?
Oh, here.
Oh, I can't let him do it.
Well, we must not forget about Major Healey breaking his leg, master.
If anybody finds out what he's doing, he'll break his neck.

I mean, I know now that I didn't, but I didn't know then that I Roger, you only saw part of tomorrow's newspaper.
Shh!
Take a look at this headline:  "Astronaut breaks leg in accident".
That's probably a misprint.
Probably a typographical error, right?
Wrong, Major Healey.
I'm afraid anything it says will happen.
Well, I don't believe it.
You won all your bets, didn't you?
I believe it.
Let's get outta here.
Wait a minute.
If I'm gonna break my leg I'm going to need extra dollars for crutches, nurses, and a And a specialist.
Roger, you aren't gonna go on with this, are you?
That's cheating.
Where's your sense of fair play?
Where was theirs the last time I was here?
Major Healey, I have always thought of you as an honest man.
Right.
Right.
Just one more bet.
Too late.
I've got it up here.

And you call yourself a newspaper woman.
Thanks a lot, pal.
Wait a minute, Jeannie, what about the other people who bet on three?

Yeah, why don't you let her help?
Get out of here.
Get out right now.
Oh, but Roger, even if she could help, it wouldn't be right.
What I mean is, if If there's a defect in the ejection seat, we've gotta find out what it is, right?
Oh.
A broken leg isn't too much to suffer for the project.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thanks.
Ah!
Hot, hot, hot.
Oh, ooh, ooh.
What in the world is going on here?
Uh, good luck, Roge.
Yeah, break a leg.
What'd you say?
Oh, "break a leg".
That's show biz talk for "good luck".
Ha, ha.
Ha.
Oh, It's funny that you should mention that.
As you know, Commander Ross was specifically selected to head this new project.
Yes, we look forward to working with him.
He slipped on the gantry ladder and, uh And broke his leg.
Yes.
It just How did you know?
Yeah, how did you know?
Well One of your premonitions?
Yes, that was it.
Remarkable.
Yeah.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, would you, uh, step over here for a minute, please?
You see, uh, Amanda just called me and told me that, uh, a friend of hers called her and said that there's a A horse running tomorrow at the racetrack.
At the racetrack?
Yes.
Uh, she didn't tell me what race.
Oh, yes, she did.
In the fifth race.
Boy, am I exhausted.
Poor, rich, poor.
Oh, I will fix you both a nice hot lunch, and that will revive you.
Oh, by the way, Jeannie, the paper come this morning?
Oh, it did not come again today, master.
Why don't you just blink one up?
Let me see, the day is the 19th.
Nineteenth.
Ooh, uh, wait a minute.
Hold it.
No, nice try, Roger.
Today is the 18th.
So I made a mistake.
Haven't you ever made a mistake?
Here you are.
The 18th.
Thank you.
Let me see that.
It's the 18th, all right.
But it's next year's paper.
Give me that.
Here, give it to me.
Just give let me have the stock market reports.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
You sure it's no trouble?
No, no.
She'll just blink up another place.
Jeannie?
That's funny.
She usually meets me right here.
Maybe she took the day off.
Heh-heh.
Never.
She's a non-union genie.
Jeannie, I'm home.
She's not in her bottle.
Hey, what's this?
I don't know.
It wasn't here this morning.
Looks like a laundry basket for swinging laundry.
Hey, this is interesting.
What's this?
Hey, what's all this?
Why don't you get Jeannie a washing machine?
She shouldn't have to do all your dishtowels by hand.
No, she never did any dishtowels by hand in her life.
She just blinks and "zap," it's done.
Since she isn't here, would you like to have dinner out tonight?
Uh, no, thanks.
I better stick around and wait for Jeannie.
I'll see you in the morning, okay?
Okay.
How 'bout that.
Oh, Tony, would you mind picking me up tomorrow morning?
Major Healey.
Shh.
Oh, Jeannie's in the study.
Huh?
She's in the study.
I wonder why she didn't answer earlier.
Um, Jeannie.
Roger's going to be home for "Quiet, nursery zone"?
Maybe she's growing trees in the study.
I don't think that's what Jeannie has in mind.
Jeannie!
Aaagh!
Aagh!
Master, you woke him.
You were right, Tony.
Different kind of nursery.
All right, Jeannie, where'd it come from?
Shh.
In the first place, it is not an "it," it is a "he," and his name is Abdullah.
Frankly, he looks like a Bruce to me.
Oh, is he not adorable, master?
Here, you hold him.
No, I don't know anything about It is very simple.
Just support his head.
That is correct.
Now walk with him.
Walk with him?
Yes.
Is he not cute?
He likes you.
Yeah, well, let's not get him too attached to me.
Here, you take him.
No, master, please.
You hold him until he goes to sleep.
He's not sleeping in my house until I find out where he comes from.
Well, that is also very simple, master.
Abdullah is my brother's son.
My brother and his wife are in the service of the sultan of Hyderabad.
And the sultan keeps my poor brother working so hard that he and his wife have never even had a chance for a honeymoon.
Little late for that now wouldn't you say?
So when the sultan decided to give my brother a week off, I agreed to take care of Abdullah.
You do not mind, do you?
No, of course not.
Why should I mind?
If anybody asks me where the baby comes from, I'll just say, "Well, on my latest mission, I flew into a stork".
Ha, ha.
Oh, master, that is brilliant.
No, it's not brilliant.
Now, you have to take him back.
Oh, master, please do not make me do that.
He is so cute, and it is only for a week.
Shh-shh.
Wait a minute, he's asleep.
I have to put him down.
Oh, Major Healey.
Is that not a beautiful scene?
It gives one goose bumps.
Frankly, it gives me heartburn.
How do you get out of this thing, anyway?
All right, Jeannie, you can have him.
You can have him, but just for a week, you understand.
Just a week.
Oh, heh.
Tony?
Oh, master.
If he lasts that long.
Master.
It's all right.
It's okay.
Jeannie, Abdullah's awake.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, it's the 2:00 feeding time.
Oh, yes.
Yes, master, right away.
Aw.
Does he not have a beautiful voice?
You can't be hungry again, kid.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Oh, I do not know what is wrong, master.
I have fed him, burped him, changed him, and it does not do any good.
Have you tried blinking him?
Master!
Sorry.
Here, you hold him.
It worked before.
Aw.
Walk with him, master.
When he closes his eyes we can put him into bed.
Shh.
Oh, you  He's asleep.
Tony, are you ready?
Roger.
Shh.
You'll wake the baby.
Now, master, the bottles are in the refrigerator, all ready for you.
The clean diapers are in the bassinet Bassinet.
Let me see, is there anything else?
Oh.
Oh, yes, oh, yes.
Please do not forget to powder his little bottom when you change him.
Change bottom.
You're not going away, are you?
Oh, just until tonight.
I promised my brother that I would take his place with the sultan of Hyderabad.
Goodbye, master.
Bye.
Tony.
Mm?
Tony.
What?
Jeannie's gone.
I'm a little gone myself.
Jeannie's gone?
What do you mean she's gone?
Jeannie!
Jeannie, come back.
What are you going to do?
We've gotta get to work.
Well, we'll get a babysitter for it, that's what we'll have to  Oh.
Shh.
Shh.
Why don't we get a rattle or a teething ring?
Huh?
Maybe there's one in the bottom of the crib.
She's got everything else here.
Roger, where did the rattle come from?
It was in my pocket with my teething ring.
I don't know, it was probably in the crib.
No, there wasn't anything in there.
I put the kid in there myself.
That's ridiculous.
How could a kid Roger, this is not just a little kid.
This is Jeannie's nephew.
A junior genie.
Roger, we can't get a babysitter for this kid.
No telling what he'll pop in.
Now, look, you, uh, tell Dr. Bellows I can't come to work because I have a cold, okay?
D-do you have a cold?
I have a cold.
I get it.
Yeah, I'll tell him.
I'll tell him, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Here, take it back.
What sort of a cold, major?
What sort, sir?
The kind that wouldn't let him come in today.
That would hardly qualify as a medical description.
What sort?
A head cold?
Well, you might say it's a pain in the neck.
Oh.
Neck pains, really?
What are his other symptoms?
Oh, uh, stuffy nose and puffy eyes, scratchy throat, unsteady on his feet.
Couldn't sleep last night.
That's just what I was afraid of.
Let's go, major.
Where are you going, sir?
To Major Nelson's house.
Sir, it's just a teeny-tiny cold.
Major Healey, what you have just described to me are the classic symptoms of the Patagonian flu.
The Patagonian flu?
Major.
What's the Patagonian flu, sir?
Tony, Dr. Bellows is here!
Major Healey, why are you shouting?
Oh, well, he also has stuffed-up ears.
Why don't you just sit down over here and just relax.
And I'll go and get Tony.
I thought you were sick.
Hi, sir.
How are you?
Major, I thought you had a stuffed-up nose.
Yes, well, it comes and goes.
Major Healey was right, you look terrible.
Terrible?
Oh, I feel fine, I don't have I'll be the judge of that.
Go into your bedroom and lie down.
I want to examine you.
Examine me?
Oh, uh, not too close, major.
If you've got what I think you have, you're highly contagious.
Well, I really don't Uh, uh Major, major, open this door.
Open the There's something wrong with this door.
Well, I Have you got a key in there?
I'm looking for it, sir.
Well, I'll just have to come through the Open this door.
Right, sir.
Oh, major, are you all right?
I'm awfully sorry.
Here.
Are you hurt?
Get up.
Now.
Here.
No, I don't know what it is, sir.
This thing seems to stick all the time.
Sit down over here.
Hm?
Sit down here.
I have to take your temperature.
Oh, my head, please.
Oh, please.
Please be quiet, baby.
Quiet, baby.
Coochy-coochy-coo.
Oh, my finger.
Let go.
Let go.
Look at funny Roger.
Funny Roger.
Little Red Riding Hood.
Remember that?
Didn't read that, huh?
Please quiet.
Oh, your rattle.
You like your rattle, right?
Well, you've only got one trick, but it works.
What's that noise?
The garbage disposal, sir.
Sounds like a baby crying.
The temperature's normal, isn't it?
Yes.
Yeah.
I told you there's nothing to worry about.
I just have a common cold, nothing I'm afraid not, major.
With the Patagonian flu, a normal temperature is quite common the first day.
All right, major.
Let's go.
Go where, sir?
To the base hospital.
I'm putting you in for observation.
I don't have to go to the hospital, sir.
There's no reason for that.
Come along, major.
But, sir Come along, major, no nonsense.
You're going to the hospital, and that's an order.
The hospital?
What about the you-know-what?
Did you get the garbage disposal fixed?
Hm?
Garbage disposal, major.
The thing that makes a noise like a baby crying.
Oh, that garbage disposal.
Well, it's quiet now.
On your way, major.
Yes, I think you better stick around in case it acts up again.
You want him to babysit with a garbage disposal?
Oh, it must be the flu.
I think I'm getting delirious.
Let's hurry, major.
Tony?
Tony.
What is it?
What is wrong with the garbage disposal?
Coochy-coochy-coo.
See the bunny?
Rattle.
Heh.
Hello, could I?
Could I have Major Nelson's room?
Oh, Tony.
Oh, Tony.
You've gotta help me.
I can't stop the baby from crying.
I don't know what to tell you, Roge.
I'm gonna get out of here as soon as I can.
Have you tried walking him?
I've been walking, running, cantering, and galloping ever since you left.
I don't know what to do.
There's a baby carriage upstairs in the den.
Take him outside.
Outside.
What'll people think?
They'll think you're walking a baby, Roger.
Uh, try using a broom handle.
On the baby?
Oh, that's inhuman.
Uh, who is that, major?
It's Roger, sir.
Oh.
Yeah, that's right.
Excuse me.
Major Healey,  Kindly do not disturb Major Nelson in the hospital just to find out how to fix a garbage disposal.
Use a broom handle.
But, Dr. Bellows, that's inhuman.
Where does he keep the broom handle?
Roger.
Roger.
Mm.
Darling.
It's been a long time.
Why haven't you called me?
It's been a long time.
I've been kind of busy.
I don't wanna hold you up.
You're not.
I have to wait for a bus right here.
Wait?
The bus just left.
I'll call you a cab.
It did?
Taxi.
Excuse me, is this your?
The bus doesn't stop here anymore.
This corner's been condemned.
Why don't you share a cab?
Roger, what are you doing?
Trying to get rid of me?
Oh, no, I've been dying to see you.
Good.
Then we can go to dinner Saturday night, okay?
Saturday night, 8:00.
Seven o'clock.
Listen, soldier boy Just around the corner, down the street.
What are you talking about?
You don't know what this lady wants.
I, uh No, I think I do.
Yeah.
Hey, what are you, some kind of monster?
Well, now just a moment, madam.
He may be a little kooky, but he certainly is no kind of monster.
Come on.
Actually, I can't go now.
I'm tied up.
I'll say he can't.
Madam, do you mind minding your own business and tend to your baby?
He is crying, you know.
My baby?
It's his baby and I think he's trying to abandon him.
His baby?
I wanna tell you about that Oh, Roger.
Oh, of all the nerve.
Why, you You Monster.
Exactly.
Come on, lady.
Let's go take that taxi.
Not my baby.
Girl's baby.
That's not my baby.
Someone Girl's baby by another Not mine, not mine.
Uh-uh, Major Nelson, you're supposed to stay in bed until Dr. Bellows gets the results of your tests from the lab.
Now, get in there.
Uh, nurse, I had one of these Now, don't talk while your temperature's being taken.
Hello, Nurses' Station Number 23?
Yeah.
Hello, nurse?
Dr. Bellows, here.
I just wanted you to know that I'm releasing Major Nelson.
Now, don't argue, nurse.
I'm at the laboratory now and the tests proved very successful.
Yes, I'm releasing him.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Highfalutin doctors.
Check 'em in, check 'em out.
No consideration.
Stella, 101 is ready.
Soon as I get the linens on you can bring in Airman Walters.
I tell you.
The way they run this hospital.
You'd think it was a pig sty.
Look at the mess.
No organization here at all.
Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
What are you doing out of your room?
I ordered complete rest.
It was a little close in there.
I decided to go to the solarium.
Out of the question.
If you've got Patagonian flu, you've got to stay in bed.
Oh, I'm sure I don't have the Patagonian flu.
I feel I could lick my weight in mountain lion W Orderly.
Well, as a matter of fact, you do look better, major.
All right, off to the solarium.
It's all right, I don't ne What's the matter?
Hot, chills.
Cold pains.
I knew it was a mistake for you to leave your room.
Try to relax.
I'll help you back to bed.
Excuse me, doctor.
If you wanna be a full-grown genie, you better shut up.
Nurse, what are you doing?
That's Major Nelson's room.
Beg your pardon.
You just told me you released him.
I released him?
Why, that's impossible.
Well, you called me a few minutes ago and said that he was in perfect health.
Does he look like he's in perfect health?
He's probably in terrible pain Major Nelson.
Oh, we've got to try and find him.
He's probably delirious.
Major Nelson!
Roger, what did you bring the kid here for?
You're leaning up against the door.
I've got to be in Dr. Bellows' office in an hour.
But I can't take care of him.
Not here in a hospital.
What better place?
If he gets sick, you'll have instant help.
Oh.
Let's go.
Watch the baby.
What would he be doing here, doctor?
I'm sorry, this is a maternity ward.
I'm sorry.
Shh, shh.
Roger?
Roger.
At least we're safe for a minute.
Well, five seconds is already up.
What do we do when a minute is up?
You take Abdullah, stay with him.
I'll go stall Dr. Bellows.
You go home and wait for Jeannie.
Dr. Bellows?
I'm supposed to be in his office in a half hour.
It's Frank.
Can I come in?
Just a minute, darling.
Get in the closet.
The closet.
Roger.
Roger.
Just a minute, Frank.
All right, darling.
Dolores, darling, how do you feel?
Dolores, where's your stomach?
You haven't already?
Huh?
What's that?
Oh, that's silly.
They would have told me.
Don't worry.
It'll be over soon, we'll have a spanking new baby.
No, no.
Dolores, what is it?
Is it?
Yes.
No.
Delores, this is it.
You're in labor.
Yes.
Doctor.
Doctor!
Tony, we gotta get out of here.
You know what this is?
A maternity ward.
Quick thinking, Roger.
Now, just calm down.
Everything's gonna be all right.
Help me with this.
We'll take your wife to the delivery room and the doctor will be waiting.
Ow!
Well, nurse, have you found him?
I'm sorry, doctor.
Major Nelson will have to wait.
This woman's in labor.
These flowers are most unsanitary.
Who put them here?
Well, I'm sorry, doctor.
Major Nelson.
Dolores.
I supposed you're wondering why I'm here, sir.
Well, I can explain.
Honestly, I can.
My wife, what did you do with my wife?
Congratulations, Mr. Carson.
Your wife just delivered a seven-pound baby boy.
I'm a father.
I'm a father.
I'm a father!
I'm a father!
Have a cigar.
Have a cigar.
I'm a father.
Doctor.
Don't try to talk.
Hurry.
Let's get him outside into to his room.
He must be delirious with fever.
Hurry, nurse.
Go to the left.
A lot's going around here that I'm going to find out, and I'm going to investigate.
My brother wishes me to thank you for taking such good care of little Abdullah even if it was not for the full week.
Well, I can't say I'm sorry to see him go, but how come you took him home so early?
Well, that is what I was going to tell you.
You see, poor little Abdullah  God bless you.
Oh, by the way, Jeannie, thanks for all the flowers, only it's not necessary.
I'll be getting out today.
Just as soon as Dr. Bellows sees the lab report.
Well, I do not think so, master.
You see, poor little Abdullah  Bless you.
Funny, I've never been allergic to flowers before.
Major Nelson.
Hi, Dr. Bellows.
Is that the lab report, sir?
I guess you found out I don't have the Patagonian flu.
That's right, major, you don't.
You have the Persian flu.
What?
Yes, you and Major Healey.
Oh, nurse, bring Major Healey in, will you, please?
It's very peculiar that you and Major Healey are the only known cases of Persian flu in two thousand years.
Poor master.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Oh, the battery's dead.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Say, Jea Oh, uh, hi.
Uh, would you blink into another outfit and give me a hand out here?
Oh, yes, master.
Right away.
Does that mean I am going with you?
No, for the last time, you can't go.
Now, hurry up.
I'm gonna be late.
How often does my very own master go on television?
Shh!
And with my hair like this, no one would know who I am.
No!
No, Jeannie.
That's my final word on the subject.
No.
Look, I'm I'm a little late.
If you could just help me, huh?
Would you, uh, turn on the ignition?
I can fix it.
No, no, no.
Uh, the last time you fixed it I found a camel under here.
Now, just turn on the ignition, huh?
Which is the ignition?
It's the one, uh, with the key.
Good.
Good.
Thanks, Jeannie.
Put your foot on the brake, will you?
Put your foot on the brake!
Put your Jeannie!
No!
No!
Not on the gas!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey, Harry.
How are you?
They do not make automobiles the way they used to.
Look at it!
Look at it!
I am sorry, master.
It was an accident.
I've got to get to the studio.
I gotta get to the studio!
Yes, master.
We can't hang around here.
Oh!
Where are we, anyway?
The TV studio.
Oh, thanks, Jeannie.
Well, now that we are here, shall we go in?
Oh, uh, Major Nelson.
Uh, Amanda.
Yes, darling.
You're my cousin from Kansas.
You're only gonna be in Cocoa Beach for a day.
And you'll never him again, got it?
Yes.
Howdy, now, Dr. Bellows.
Just in time for your rehearsal, major.
I'd like you to meet I am his cousin, Jeannie, from Kansas who will only be in Cocoa Beach for one day so you will never see me again.
Oh.
This is my cousin, Homer Banks.
He's from out of town too.
Put it there, captain.
Yeah.
Major.
Captain, major.
What difference does it make?
We're all on the same team, huh?
Miss, you are as pretty as a picture.
I'm in siding.
Aluminum siding.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
He's very successful.
As a matter of fact, he has everything except a wife.
And I'm working on that.
Major Nelson, you and your party come right on in.
Come along, major.
Uh, but sir Oh, no, no.
Your public's waiting.
Come along.
Ah, ah, ah.
We don't have to go in yet, Jeannie.
Why don't us, um, cousins stay out here for a little while and chew the fat, huh?
Thank you very much, Mr. Banks Oh, Homer, please.
Oh, Homer Please, I, uh, I would like to go in and see my master Um Um Um, my cousin rehearse.
Oh, but there's nothing to watch.
Besides, you'll see it all a little later.
Come on.
Let me buy you a cup of coffee.
Oh, well, but Mr. Banks, I Homer.
Oh, Mr. Homer, I do not want any coffee.
Why, sure, you do.
There's nothing like a hot cup of coffee to break the ice.
Cream and sugar.
Mr. Homer, please let go of my hand.
Jeannie, I'm a man of action.
When I find something I like I never let go, hm?
Hm!
Ooh!
Oh, my hand is stuck.
Jeannie, help me.
Oh, yes, Mr. Homer.
I will send out some paper towels so that you may clean up the mess.
I think she likes me.
Excuse me.
Where did you come from?
Oh, uh, Kansas.
I'm cousin Jeannie.
Well, howdy, howdy, cousin Jeannie.
I'm Carl Tucker.
Owner and general manager of Carl Tucker Cars, the largest transportation center in Cocoa Beach.
What can I do for you?
Oh, well, uh, how much will it cost to fix this car?
Oh, you really like this car, do you, little lady?
You've got a real eye.
She's one of a kind.
Now, actually, we don't own her.
But we might be able to persuade the owner to part with her.
Oh, but Mr. Tucker The, uh, damage isn't too bad.
Superficial, really.
Now, by the time our service department gets finished with it, you won't recognize it.
Now, I might be able to let you have it for, say, uh, But Mr Sixteen-hundred.
You do not understand.
I am the one who wrecked the car.
Oh.
Well, in that case, as I say, the damage may look superficial, but there are probably internal injuries.
Internal injuries?
Oh, yes.
The block looks like it's cracked.
The axle is shot.
Upholstery pretty well beat.
Yes.
And we got the bumpers bent up pretty good too.
New tires.
New tires?
Uh, windshield.
No windshield.
But how?
How much will it cost?
Ooh, could run as high as, say, uh, $500.
Five hundred dollars?
Oh, that is terrible.
You know, miss, I shouldn't be saying this, but I like you.
And I want to see you get a fair shake.
If I were you, I'd get rid of her.
It's a junk heap.
But who would want to buy a junk heap?
Four hundred dollars.
As she stands.
And I'll be losing money.
Uh, I do not understand.
You were going to sell the car to me for $1699.
Look, miss, I want you to understand something.
Carl Tucker may not be a rich man, he may not be a handsome man, but he's an honest man.
And when I say something about a car, you can believe it.
My word is my bond.
Now, I want you to promise me something.
If you ever catch me saying anything about any car on this lot that isn't true, you show me, and I'll be the first one in the world to admit it.
Promise?
Oh, I promise, Mr. Tucker.
Four hundred dollars.
Now, let me see.
You would give me $400.
And it would cost $500 to repair it.
That means my master would save $100.
Oh, I will take it.
Oh, you're a shrewd businesswoman.
Well, now, you'll be needing a new car, won't you?
Mm.
I'll tell you what.
Look around the lot.
Take as long as you want.
And when you see one you like, you call me.
And remember, if you find anything wrong with any car on this lot, you show me up for a faker.
Right?
Right.
Oh, what a nice man.
Ooh, with this $400, I will be able to buy my master a new car.
How would he ever get along without me?
And that's kind of a funny sighting we men really get a charge out of.
Yeah, but you know, I'm real disappointed, captain.
I was looking forward to seeing that cute little filly again.
That cute little filly trotted back to Kansas.
Well, I may just have to trot right back there after her.
She really took my fancy.
Ho-ho!
Shh!
Quiet, everyone.
It's starting.
And now, On the Spot, the program that covers the country bringing you interviews with the people you would most like to see on the spot.
On the Spot is brought to you by Carl Tucker Automobiles, the largest automotive center in Cocoa Beach.
Hi, folks.
Carl Tucker, here.
Owner and general manager of Carl Tucker Cars, the largest transportation center in Cocoa Beach.
Here we are in our used car division, one of three separate facilities offering you everything limos to fine transportation cars.
So So whether you've got $100 or $5000 to spend on a car, you'll find what you're looking for at Carl Tucker's.
Come on down and see us, you hear?
Come here.
Hold the cards a little closer.
I don't want to have to squint.
People think you're dishonest when you squint.
Say, Mr. Tucker, Yes.
Who's that chick over there?
She's been here all day long going through every car on the lot.
Now, you leave her alone.
That chick's my pigeon.
And let me know when it's time for the next commercial, huh?
Right.
This looks like my master's car.
Well, miss, I can see you've got good taste.
You sure picked a beauty.
Oh, but Mr. Tucker, is this not the car?
It's a shame to call this used.
Clean as the day she was produced.
Not a mark on her.
I am sure this is my master's car.
I happen to know this car was owned by a retired clergyman.
Yes, this is it!
Wha?
Wha?
Wha?
What happened?
Mr. Tucker, you asked me to tell you if you were wrong, and, well, this is the car that you bought from me this morning for $400.
Oh, jeez.
We made a deal this morning fair and square.
If you don't like it, take your business elsewhere?
Oh, but I Mr. Tucker, time for the next commercial.
What happened?
I don't know.
Mr. Tucker?
Mr. Tucker?
Oh.
I think he is trying to cheat me.
Now, here is a letter from Frances Gordon of Chicago to our astronaut, Major Nelson.
She wants to know how thick is the dust on the moon?
Uh, well, our surveyor program has shown us that it's from a few inches to a few feet.
However, in, uh, several areas it's strong enough to support a landing craft.
Thank you, major.
There will be more questions for On the Spot in a moment, after this brief pause for a word from Carl Tucker Automobiles.
Hm!
You come off real good, major.
You really do.
Hi, friends.
Carl Tucker again.
Owner and general manager of Carl Tucker Cars, the largest transportation facility in Cocoa Beach.

Mr. Tucker, you told me to tell you if what you said about a car was not true.
That looks like your cousin.
Um, no, it couldn't be.
She's back in Kansas.
What?
You see, folks?
People just can't wait to shop and then buy at Carl Tucker.
Beat it, lady We're We're on camera.
That is your cousin!
Oh, sorry Sorry.
Sorry.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I just had these pants pressed.
Um Um Uh, sir, may I change the channel on that?
I hope you don't mind Leave it alone, major.
Homer's right.
Why did you say she went home?
But you were trying to cheat all those people who are watching on television.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
Get out of here.
That is not right.
Well, because it It just looks like her, sir.
It's really not her.
You see, the reception on this thing is terrible.
Isn't it, Roge?
Huh?
That's a good picture.
What's wrong with you, major?
The reception's fine.
Oh, here's the problem, sir.
It's right here.
Major Nelson, why did you destroy my television set?
Oh, I'm I'm terribly sorry about that, sir.
I I insist we have it repaired immediately, right, Roge?
What have you done to Dr. Bellow's television?
I I know a place that stays open on Sundays, sir.
I'll go there right away.
You broke his set!
Oh, that's darling of them, isn't it, dear?
You know, they really are very conscientious.
Amanda, they didn't That's a shame.
I'm going down to the used car lot and find Jeannie.
They really are very sweet Amanda, they didn't take the set.
Do you know how much these commercials cost me a minute?
Well, I'll tell you.
No I won't.
Every second I yell at you, it costs me money.
Look, hold her.
Don't let her get away.
Come on.
Finish.
Awfully sorry about the interruption, folks, Before we return you to our program, let me show you a few of Carl Tucker's finest.
Now, the blue books says this car should sell for $2532.
Our price at Carl Tucker's Unfortunately, this car has already been sold.
Forget the license number.
But there are many more cars here, one that'll really suit you.
Anything you need, right here at Carl Tucker's.
Okay, take this late-model station wagon.
This car has powered doors.
A little joke, folks.
Always like to try and keep them laughing here at Carl Tucker's.
This isn't happening.
This can't be happening.
Now, this is Carl Tucker This is Carl Tucker, owner and general manager of Carl Tucker Cars, returning you to To What's the name of that stupid program?
On the Spot.
And it is not a stupid program.
My master is on it.
Lady, what do I have to do to get rid of you?
First, you must promise not to lie about your cars anymore.
I promise, I promise.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Good.
Now I will take my master's old car back.
Sixteen-hundred and ninety-nine dollars.
Mr. Tucker.
All right, all right, whatever you say.
Take it for nothing.
Just go.
Oh, no, that would not be fair.
You paid me $400 for it, and I will give you $400 back.
Oh, is that not wonderful?
I did it right.
This This isn't happening, so it really doesn't make any difference, but lady, you drive the car from the front seat.
Oh, I know.
But you see, I do not know how to drive.
Makes sense.
Makes perfect sense.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
It's me, Homer!
Turn around, turn around, turn around!
Turn around!
Jeannie!
Good afternoon, officer.
Was I speeding?
Lady, why are you persecuting me?
Oh, I I do not understand.
It's because I'm a cop, right?
And you just hate cops, huh?
I mean, everybody hates cops nowadays.
Oh, no, officer, I do not hate policemen.
Oh, I have great respect for them.
That is why I was not driving the car.
Well, I know it is illegal to drive without a license.
Oh, there's my master.
He will explain everything.
Good day, officer.
How are you?
I can explain everything.
I, uh This Uh, show him your ID, will you, Roge?
Okay.
ID.
Master!
Shh!
Did you notice your car?
It is all fixed.
Yeah, it's wonderful.
Wonderful.
And it did not cost anything.
That is the most wonderful thing.
Mr. Tucker said that I heard what Mr. Tucker said.
Uh, what I'm worried about is what the policeman's gonna say about a car driving itself.
Oh, master, you do not have to worry about him.
All I will do is simply go: N-no, no.
You can't go around blinking out policemen to Afghanistan.
It's not not legal.
Not even nice.
Just follow my lead and don't do anything.
Oh, master, I would follow you anywhere.
Here's a picture of my mother.
And, uh, here's a picture of my father, and here's a picture of my mother and my father.
I'm waiting, major.
You remember mom?
We're with R&D.
Research and development.
Top secret.
Q clearance.
Just testing a little project, here.
Uh-huh.
How to destroy the morale of the police department.
Yeah.
You see that car?
Looks like an ordinary automobile, doesn't it?
It's a highly sophisticated remote-control space device.
We're testing it out on land before we take it up there.
And I suppose the girl is a computer, huh?
Shh!
How'd you know?
I I watch television, same as the next guy.
Yeah, well, we were trying to get the bugs out of her when she ran into you earlier.
She's a very complicated piece of machinery.
Ain't that the truth.
You mean you believe him?
Of course I do.
I mean, uh, the way I see it, either I believe him or I'm some kind of a fruitcake.
I thought I'd never catch you.
Jeannie Oh, Jeannie, I've gotta talk to you.
Jeannie?
Who's Jeannie?
This young lady is Jeannie.
And she's the major's cousin from Kansas.
But officer, I've explained the situation to you I know, I know, I know.
You told me that the car was a remote-control space vehicle and that the girl was a computer.
Yes But the other fella told me that she was your cousin, Jeannie, from Kansas.
Now, I ask you, major, if you was me, which one would you believe?
It's all right, everybody.
I just called cousin Alfred.
He's on his way.
Oh, great.
Cousin Alfred?
What's he, another computer?
No, he's an Air Force psychiatrist.
Good, because one of us is gonna need him.
Now, Jeannie Jeannie, don't you worry.
After we're married we'll look back at this and we'll smile, hm?
Ow!
Ooh!
Oh!
Ooh!
I am sorry.
Won't you sit down?
Don't you see that knocked right off that desk?
It really hurt me.
It did Right here.
It smarts.
Officer, you forced me into a situation I was hoping to avoid.
Oh, what's that?
Roger.
Yes?
Jeannie's got to go.
Yes, sir.
Jeannie's got to go.
Stand back, please.
Yes, since you saw her, the security of the project was hopelessly compromised.
I had to press the destruct button.
Jeannie?
I didn't know genies had springs.
Look at me when I talk to you.
What's going on, here?
Officer, why have these people been arrested?
Everything's taken care of, sir.
Not quite.
Colonel, are you really a psychiatrist?
I am.
Good.
Could you spare me about an hour?
You see, I I think I need help.
Homer, did you find Jeannie?
I'd rather not talk about it.
Oh, master.
Oh, Jeannie, stop apologizing.
It's all right.
It's all over.
But master, I caused you so much trouble.
Forget it.
On second thought, remember it so you won't do it again.
Oh, yes.
No.
Yeah?
Oh!
Yes?
Major.
Uh, I'm Carl Tucker, owner and general manager of Carl Tucker Cars, the largest transportation center in Cocoa Beach.
Are we alone?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Good.
Uh, you see, through an oversight, we sold you your car for $400 yesterday afternoon.
Yeah, exactly what you paid for it.
But we put an awful lot of work on it.
Uh, my service manager tells me $500.
Five hundred dollars?
Yes.
Are you sure we're alone?
Yeah Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Replace front fender: $129.
Windshield: $92.
Motor mounts: $76   What was that?
Well, it sounds like an engine falling onto the ground.
My car.
Well, look, uh, about this $500, uh, I I'm not sure I can Forget the bill.
It's not happening.
It's not happening.
It didn't happen yesterday.
It's not happening now.
Forget the bill.
Good day, major.
Well, I I can mail you a check.
I don't even want cash.
It's not happening.
It's not happening
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Oh, thank you, major.
Hm.
This is very kind of you.
Oh, it's nothing at all.
Take anything you think the foundation can use.
Oh, that's very generous.
Why don't you just putter around in the garage and take anything you want?
I've gotta call Major Healey.
Oh, thank you.
I didn't know you had a dog, major.
I've never seen that one before.
Isn't he cute?
Oh.
Look at him.
Isn't he adorable?
Look at that face.
I wonder if he could be lost.
I know all the dogs on the block.
He's not from around here, that's for sure.
There's no identification on his collar.
Oh, puppy dog, you better go on home.
Your master's probably worried about you.
Well, it looks like you made yourself a friend.
Yeah.
All right, puppy, you can come with me while I look in the major's garage.
Come.
Good boy.
Good boy, puppy.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Hi, Roge.
It's Tony.
Yeah.
Mrs. Bellows drove me home, so I won't need a ride.
Yeah, well, thanks anyhow.
Roger?
Are you growling at me?
Huh?
Well, I don't know why you'd be growling, but something is.
It sounds like a dog.
Yeah, a dog.
Yeah, oh, never mind, the problem's solved.
When we arrived, there was a little dog at the door.
He must have gotten inside.
Yeah.
Well, I don't know what kind of dog.
Just a regular, ordinary, invisible dog, you know.
Invisible dog?
Yeah, it's an invisible dog.
That's exactly what it Roger, I'll call you back, huh?
Roge?
Roge?
Here, boy.
Here, boy.
Come on.
Nice puppy.
Come on, boy.
Come on.
There you are.
Come on.
Come here, fella.
Come here.
Come on, puppy.
Come on, puppy.
Come on, boy.
Give me that.
Give me that.
Give me that!
Hey, this is getting expensive.
Puppy?
Come on.
Stop playing games.
Come on, puppy.
Come on, puppy.
Here, puppy.
Here, puppy.
I see you.
I see you.
Come on, boy.
Here!
Ha!
Ha!
Major, I've found a number of things I can u Major, what are you doing on the floor?
Well, I just slipped.
Are you all right?
Oh, fine, fine.
A little attack of the clumsies.
The dog must have gone home.
I can't find him anywhere.
Oh!
There you are.
Oh.
How clever to find your way inside the house.
You know, major, this dog just adores me.
Yeah.
I'm going to take him home with me.
Honestly, Mrs. Bellows, I don't think that's a terribly good idea.
What I mean is, I don't think that Dr. Bellows will want to put up with the little dog.
Nonsense.
Alfred loves animals.
And besides, there's something special about this dog.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yes, I do.
I can just feel it.
Yeah, so can I. What?
What I mean is, perhaps he's lost.
What'll happen when the owner comes looking for him?
Well, naturally, major, I intend to take an ad in the paper.
Well, that's a good No, no.
Wait a minute.
I'm sure he's from around the neighborhood.
But you told me you knew all the dogs in the neighborhood.
Well, perhaps he's new.
I tell you what.
Why don't I put an ad in the paper, and if nobody comes to claim him within a week, say, he's yours.
You can have him.
Well, perhaps you're right.
All right, darling, but I'm gonna miss you.
But it's just gonna be for a couple of days.
Now, you take good care of the little darling.
Why don't you just put him on the chair.
Major, don't you like dogs?
Love 'em.
I love 'em.
It's just that little dogs shouldn't be handled, you know?
Oh.
All right, darling.
There you are.
And you be good, huh?
I'll see you in a few days.
Take good care of him for me.
I'll come back in a week.
I will.
Oh, incidentally, thank you very much for all the goodies.
Oh, my pleasure.
I'm gonna send a truck and pick them up.
Anytime, Mrs. Bellows.
All right.
You and I are gonna have a little talk.
You're just  Wait.
Wait.
Hey.
Ah!
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
Tony.
Roger.
Roger.
Ah!
I like that.
It's a combination of frug and swim.
What's the matter?
What do you mean?
He's here.
Who's here?
The dog.
What dog?
The invisible dog.
Oh, the invisible dog.
Oh, there's an invisible dog!
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Yes, master?
Master?
Master!
Well, that is strange.
I could have sworn I heard Arf.
Djinn Djinn.
Oh, Djinn Djinn, you darling little dog.
How did you find me, you clever puppy?
Oh, master.
Guess what.
Djinn Djinn has come home.
Get him out!
I-I want him out of my house.
Look at me.
Look.
Look what he's done.
No.
Oh, but master No, absolutely not.
Jeannie, if you want a pet, you get a pet that doesn't disappear.
And doesn't have any teeth.
Look, if you wanted a pet, I would have given you anything.
A dog, cat, a chicken.
It didn't matter.
Oh, but master, I had Djinn Djinn long before I had you.
He has followed me all the way from ancient Baghdad.
Do you realize how far that is?
Too far to throw him back.
Forget the fact that he keeps disappearing.
And forget the fact I promised him to Mrs. Bellows.
The fact is that that dog hates me.
Oh, no, master, you are wrong.
It is just that he does not know you yet.
Oh, once he has discovered how kind and noble and generous you are he will love you forever.
Once you have fed him, taken him for walks and played with him.
Oh, master, please, please give him a chance, please.
Roger, I'm weakening, what am I gonna do?
Don't ask me.
I've always been a sucker for dog movies.
Oh, master, you are wonderful.
Oh, Djinn Djinn will love you forever.
All right, Harry, I'll get the report in as soon as I can.
Yeah.
Okay, by tonight.
Right.
I'm sorry to disturb you, major, but Mrs. Bellows wants to know if anyone answered the ad about the dog?
The d?
Oh, the dog.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
As a matter of fact, I was just about to phone you.
The owner called and I'm afraid the little dog is gone.
Oh, she'll be disappointed.
Well, tell her for me that he's very happy.
He's in a fine home.
Very old family.
Amanda really fell in love with the little fellow.
Oh, well.
Thank you, Major Nelson.
What's that?
What?
It's my throat, sir.
I think I need some water.
There you are.
How about that, huh?
There you are, master.
Oh, thanks, Jeannie.
Say, this is sensational.
Just the way I like it.
Jeannie, this is not gonna work.
Oh, master, you must be more patient.
You must earn his trust.
Well, Djinn Djinn, we're making some progress.
At least you're beginning to learn who's master around here, huh?
Darling, isn't that Major Nelson?
Yes.
Major Nelson.
Come on, Djinn Djinn, let's get out of here.
What's that thing he's dragging?
Major Nelson.
Major.
Major, wait.
Major Nelson.
Yeah.
Major, what on earth are you doing?
Oh, you mean about this dog?
I can explain that.
What dog?
Well, this dog.
He's gone.
Well, he's gone.
I thought the owner answered your advertisement and picked the dog up.
Well, I did, but it turned out to be the wrong owner.
Well How marvelous, then.
I can have the dog after all.
Oh, no, you can't.
What?
Well, what I mean is, that, uh It slipped its collar.
It's run away.
It's probably miles away from here by now.
I'm sorry about that.
Here, boy.
Why, there you are, you little darling sweetheart.
Look, dear, didn't I tell you he was adorable?
Yes.
So, major, I hope you haven't forgotten that you and Major Healey are due at NASA in a half-hour for the weightlessness experiments.
No, sir.
No, sir, I haven't forgotten.
If you just let me take the dog home now Oh, there's no need for that, major.
No, I have a marvelous idea.
Why don't you go on to NASA.
I'll take the doggy home with me.
But I wouldn't dream of that.
Oh, it's no trouble at all, major.
No one has answered the ad, so he's practically mine.
But I can't wait to get acquainted with the new member of our family.
Come along.
Mrs. Bellows Amanda, I  I'm with you all the way, Tony.
Yeah.
As soon as we finish this experiment, we go over to Dr. Bellows' house, we make up some fantastic story, then we get the dog back.
Roger, we don't have time.
If that hound pulls its disappearing act in front of Mrs. Bellows, we're gonna be doing the rest of our experiments at Fort Leavenworth.
Leavenworth?
Yeah.
Then I'm with you part of the way.
What's your next move?
It's simple.
We ask Dr. Bellows to postpone the experiment then we dash over to his house and grab the dog.
Then we go to Leavenworth.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Now, If you'll put down your lead weights I'll start the anti-gravitation mechanism.
Sir, I was wondering if we could postpone the experiment.
Postpone?
We're already behind schedule.
I know that, sir, but I've got Now, major, get rid of those weights now.
And that's an order.
Sorry.
Thanks, Roge.
I'll get on the air jet, sir.
All set, gentlemen?
Dr. Bellows Good.
Just relax.
I'll be back in a couple of hours to see how you're doing.
Tony.
About your plan.
Yeah.
Can I ask you one thing?
What?
Would you scratch my back?
I can't reach it.
Master.
Ah!
Major Healey.
What are you doing up here?
We're just hanging around.
Jeannie.
Please, master, do not be angry with me.
I know I am not supposed to come to NASA but when you did not return home, I became worried about Djinn Djinn.
Where is he?
Djinn Djinn is with Mrs. Bellows.
You gave away my dog?
No, I didn't give him away.
She took him.
I want you to go to her house and get him back, right now.
Yes, master.
Right away.
You see, Roger?
All our problems are solved.
Not quite.
My back still itches.
It's out of the question, Amanda.
You may not leave that dog here.
This is a government installation, not a pet shop.
Alfred, don't be so stuffy.
What's the point of being a colonel if you can't break the rules once in a while?
I don't want to leave this little puppy dog alone the first day we have him with us.
Besides, I've got a million things to do.
Why don't you take him along with you?
Oh, darling, I can't.
I've gotta go to that charity luncheon, then I made an appointment to get my hair done.
I didn't ask you for your itinerary.
Then I have to go pick up my new outfit at the dressmaker's.
Oh, that reminds me, I need some money.
Amanda, you can't.
Darling, you want me to dress well, don't you?
I mean, what's the point of being a colonel's wife if I can't set an example for the little people.
Besides, I haven't bought a new outfit in weeks.
I couldn't care less about the dress.
Here, now Thank you, darling.
But you cannot leave that dog here.
Here, you be nice to your new daddy.
Now, dear, listen.
What you better do with him is take him for a little walk every couple of hours.
Goodbye, darling, thanks a million.
But, Amanda.
Master.
Ah!
I could not find him anywhere.
He is not there.
Not there?
He's gotta be there.
Maybe you couldn't see him.
Put a bell on him.
Oh, I looked everywhere.
What if he is lost and alone in a strange city?
Oh, poor Djinn Djinn.
I must find him.
All right.
Find Mrs. Bellows.
He's probably with her.
You can pretend you're the dog's owner.
I am the owner.
I do not have to pretend.
Jeannie, you don't have to mention that you and Djinn Djinn are genies.
Now, really, master, would I be silly enough to say a thing like that?
Well, I-I-I Well, it's been known to hap Jeannie?
Major Nelson, Major Healey.
What happened, sir?
Your uniform.
Oh, yes, major.
That dog.
What dog, sir?
You know very well what dog.
That ferocious brute you gave my wife.
Oh, you mean the dog's here, in NASA?
It's here?
No, he's at Windsor Castle.
Of course he's at NASA.
He just attacked me.
You shouldn't go around dressed like that.
This is a government installation.
Major Healey, have you ever argued with a woman who has just fallen in love with a dog?
No, but Tony has.
It was incredible.
I didn't even see him attack me.
All I could hear was growling.
He was all over me.
Biting here, tearing there, and I still couldn't see him.
That brute moves with the speed of lightning.
Oh, yes, sir.
He's very quick.
Where is he now?
In my office.
Your office?
Well, why don't you We go to your office, and, uh The three of us.
And then we can pick up the dog.
I promise you'll never see him again.
That's a good idea, Tony.
There's only one thing.
What's that, major?
How we get down to the floor?
Dr. Bellows.
Lieutenant Griswold.
I'm up here.
What is it?
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were taking part in the experiment.
General Peterson wants to see you.
He's waiting in your office.
Tell the general I'll be right there.
I have something to do.
He's waiting in your office.
I know that, major.
Oh, Lieutenant Griswold.
Get us down quick.
Quick.
But, sir, you No "sir," no "buts".
Push that button.
Yes, sir.
Whoa!
Look out!
I hope we're not  Too late.
Major, you open the door.
I can't.
In case you don't know, I've been through three wars.
I have the Bronze Star, the Silver Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for bravery in action.
General Martin Peterson has never been afraid of anything in his entire life.
But whatever it is in your office, Dr. Bellows, had me sniveling in terror.
I wanna know what kind of a secret weapon you've got in there, and I wanna know right now.
No, you don't.
What was that?
Nothing, sir.
All right, Dr. Bellows.
What was it?
A puppy dog, sir.
What did you say?
Dr. Bellows is right, sir.
It was a little puppy dog.
I don't know what you three are trying to pull!
The hound of the Baskervilles couldn't have done this to me!
Dr. Bellows, I want a straight answer.
I'm telling the truth, sir.
And I'm telling you there was no dog in that room.
It was a very small dog, sir.
And lightning fast, sir.
Major Nelson, I still have 20/20 vision, and I did not see a dog!
But you heard him growl, didn't you?
Growl?
It sounded like a small tank!
General, if you'd give me permission, I-I'll just take a moment and go to Dr. Bellows' office and bring the dog here for you.
If he's so vicious, why aren't you afraid?
I am, sir.
But, frankly, I'm more afraid of you.
He's just a little dog, now.
He's just a little puppy dog.
I won't be afraid of a little puppy dog.
Master.
Jeannie!
Oh, master, I have looked everywhere for Mrs. Bellows.
Hi, Harry.
I cannot find her.
I went to the supermarket, the beauty shop, the grocery Don't worry, the dog's in the office.
Oh, master, you found him.
Oh, you are wonderful.
Shh.
I said you don't have to worry.
I still have to worry.
That has dog attacked me, Roger, Colonel Bellows and General Peterson.
I cannot understand it, Djinn Djinn was always such a friendly little dog.
Yeah, well I've got four shredded uniforms that prove that he's vicious.
Uniforms?
Yes.
That is it.
What is it?
Oh, I will show you.
Ah!
Oh, Djinn Djinn, my poor baby.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
He's fine.
It's the Air Force I'm worried about.
Listen, General Peterson's waiting for me.
Jeannie.
If you know what makes this dog act this way would you please tell me, for heaven's sakes?
Here, you hold him.
No.
I don't want him.
I don't want the dog.
I Well, he seems to be all right now.
Uh-huh!
Now, watch.
You see, when Djinn Djinn was a puppy the guards at the nearest palace were cruel to him.
And they wore uniforms.
Oh, you mean he hates uniforms.
Mm-hm.
Terrific, terrific.
The ideal dog for an Air Force officer.
Who is it?
It's I, sir, Major Nelson.
Have you got the dog?
Yes, sir.
Take cover.
Take cover.
Come in now, major.
I, uh Oh, hi, Roge.
Uh, general?
Miss Peabody.
This is Ms. Peabody.
Major Healey.
You look just like Jeannie And, of course, Dr. Bellows, and General Peterson.
How do you do, honey?
Ms. Peabody is the owner of the dog.
You see, I-I put an ad in the newspaper, and, uh, she traced me here.
You mean that's what attacked me?
I don't believe it.
Its true, sir.
Ms. Peabody will be able to explain.
I'm awfully sorry little Djinn Djinn caused such a rumpus.
Naughty, naughty, Djinn Djinn.
But you see, it was daddy's chauffeur.
He wore a uniform, you know.
And every morning, he'd kick little Djinn Djinn in the head.
Hello, Mrs. Bellows.
Oh, Miss Crawford.
Do you know where my husband is?
Yes.
He's, uh, in General Peterson's office.
It's right around the corner.
Is that a new outfit, Mrs. Bellows?
Yes.
Yes, it is as a matter of fact.
It's darling.
Well, thank you.
It's called the military look.
Amanda, please!
This is a government installation.
Dr. Bellows, I wanna talk to you.
Ah.
You see, master, he adores you.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Oh, master, it was a wonderful film.
Oh, may we see it again, please?
Oh, Jeannie, we've seen it three times.
I didn't like it the first time.
But, master, I knew Ali Baba, and it is so much fun seeing my old friends.
Please?
Please?
Yes, just like home movies.
What do you want me to do with the popcorn?
Take it home and eat it.
Waste not, want not.
Where did you get that?
It is an old Ali Baba-ism.
Mmm.
I would dig to carry your books.
Oh, thank you very much, but I do not have any books.
I have a library at home.
Hey.
Take your hands off her.
A bus driver that talks?
Just let us go our way.
Oh!
Hey, come on now, take it easy, will ya?
Come on, Jeannie.
Hey, wait a minute, man.
Don't take her away.
She's pretty.
Master, shall I help you?
No, no.
I don't want you to help me.
Isn't that darling, man?
Mama's gonna help him.
Why don't you guys just leave us alone or I'll call a cop, huh?
Hm, what do you say?
Master!
Are you threatening me?
No, I'm not threatening you, I just said I'd call a cop.
Master!
Hey, fellas.
All right.
Hey, all right.
All right.
Knock it off.
I'm gonna pick up my hat, and I'm gonna walk out of here peacefully.
Oh, I'm sorry, fellas.
Did I do that with one punch?
Oh, yes, master.
You were wonderful.
How about that?
Yeah, well You didn't help me, did you?
Oh, no, master.
Not at all.
I did not do one little thing.
You're sure?
I promise.
One punch.
Two of 'em.
How 'bout that?
Oh!
Sorry, I'm sorry.
Major Nelson.
Yes?
That was one of the finest exhibitions of self-defense I've ever witnessed.
Oh, I'm sorry for the spectacle, sir, I wasn't responsible No need to be sorry, major.
They were clearly the aggressors.
You know, you may be just the man I'm looking for.
Report to my office tomorrow morning at 9:00 for a new assignment.
Uh, new assignment, sir?
Yes, I'm in charge of the armed forces boxing tournament.
You're gonna be the Air Force's new contender.
What?
Nine o'clock, major.
Oh, well, I    Uh, general, I We've gotta think of a name for you.
Nelson, sir.
Anthony Nelson.
A boxing name.
Something with a mean ring to it.
General, I really don't With you in there, we can't lose.
I can't wait to see Gutsy Gorman's face when you knock out his man.
Gutsy Gorman?
General Gorman, the Marine Corps commandant of this area.
Been riding me for years about how tough the Marine Corps is.
Well, he's gonna find out what tough really is.
Uh, general, there's something you ought to know.
What's that?
Well, uh, about me knocking those men out.
It was just an accident.
You're too modest, Nelson.
I saw it with my own eyes.
You clobbered them.
I like modesty.
Oh, I'm not modest.
I'm scared.
Scared?
Oh, you mean, you're afraid you'll hurt your opponent.
Well, don't you worry about it.
Killer Culligan can take it.
Killer Culligan?
The Marine Corps champion.
He's 230 pounds of solid muscle, so don't you worry about hurting him.
Uh, general, I've never fought professionally.
I mean, I just threw one punch.
That's it!
Your name, that's it.
One-Punch Nelson.
You can't let the guys down.
They're counting on you.
Roger, it's better than counting over me.
Got to have confidence.
Roger, I don't need confidence.
I need a-a left jab and a right cross and a And a rabbit.
You You broke the table with your fist.
I broke it with my fist.
Yeah.
Now he will have confidence.
No, it must have been broken before.
Oh, you've got your confidence back.
Wait till I tell the guys at the base about this.
Hey, now, wait a minute, Roger.
I'm gonna find some Marines and take some money away from them.
Wait a minute, Roger.
Look, I'd appreciate it if you just didn't say anything about this to anybo  Oh, I gotta show them this.
Take care of your hand.
That's good.
That's very good.
Roge.
Oh, boy.
I tell you.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, would you come out of there, please?
Come on, Jeannie, I should have known you were doing this.
Did you say something, master?
Jeannie?
She couldn't have done it.
Look out, Killer Culligan.
You're don't have to worry about a thing.
I'll pull my punches, you won't get hurt.
Are you kidding?
They used to call me Twinkletoes Healey.
You'll never lay a glove on me.
Uh, Roger, I appreciate your offer to train me, but this is won't be a scientific fight.
I'm just gonna get in there and lay him out with one punch.
That's what I like to see.
Confidence.
What if he hits you first?
Roger, you promised not to discuss that.
If you do, forget it.
All right.
Okay.
Hand.
Hit the hand.
Here we go.
Oh, that's it.
Come on.
Hit the glove.
Here we go.
Here we go.
Hard.
Come on, don't be afraid.
Oh!
Ooh.
That's it.
Come on, champ.
Hit the hand, champ.
Take it easy now, champ.
Well.
You look very professional.
Thank you, sir.
It's all the feetwork, really I was talking to Mrs. Bellows this morning, and she's very anxious to win her bet, major.
You can tell her she doesn't have to worry, sir.
I'm sure she doesn't.
Uh, she found someone to train you.
Yes.
Uh, Jerry?
Uh, this is Major Nelson and Major Healey.
Gentlemen, I would like you to meet Jerry Quarry.
Okay, One-Punch.
Let's go to work.
Yeah.
What do you want me to do?
Hit me in the breadbasket.
In where?
Right in the breadbasket.
Oh, sure.
Good punch.
Good punch.
Now let's try a   Did you hit him?
Okay.
Okay, I think I got it now.
Okay.
Ready.
Put your hands up.
Yeah.
Come on, work.
Move those feet.
Work.
Work.
Work.
Come on, boy.
Work.
Nothing to it, partner.
You try it.
Uh, Jerry, you better stand back a little bit.
This is where I shine.
You know, One-Punch Nelson.
I'll risk it, One Pug.
Let her go.
Roge, see if you can get another one of these.
There won't be a lot left when I'm through.
Good thinking.
All right, Killer Culligan.
Oh.
I think it's broken.
My wrist I got a bag.
What's the matter?
Take a look at it, will you?
Call off the fight, Roge.
Call off the fight.
No, you're all right.
You just hit it wrong.
At home I broke a table with one blow, right?
He put his fist through the door.
Think I'm losing my stuff?
Don't worry, slugger.
Come on.
Just keep your wrist straight and hit it with your shoulder.
Now try it again.
Yeah, more shoulder, champ.
I keep my wrist straight and hit it with my shoulder.
Okay.
That's it, champ.
Take it easy.
Easy does it.
Yeah.
Okay?
You can do it, champ.
You can do it.
How was that, huh?
That's it.
Say, that thing's alive.
You okay, champ?
It's alive.
If that can knock me down, think what Killer Culligan's gonna do.
Get me out of this fight.
Jerry, I can't handle it.
Cancel the fight.
Stop it.
Stop it.
Now, buck up, champ.
You just got to learn never to turn away.
Now, hit it again, and this time I'll hold it for you.
Just use the same amount of strength you used on the towel.
Huh?
Just hit it right here.
Right there?
My master needs more confidence.
Stand back, Roge.
Stand back.
You all right?
Jerry?
Fantastic.
You got him with the old one-punch.
I knocked out Jerry Quarry with this?
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna like it.
You're right.
Let's get him to the dressing room.
Oh.
Sorry.
Sorry, Jerry.
I didn't do that, Jerry.
I didn't know my own strength.
It's gonna be all right, Jerry.
Wake up, please.
What round is it?
What round is it?
Uh Gee, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to knock you out.
You knocked me out?
Mm.
You knocked me out.
Oh, I'll say.
I haven't been hit that hard since the Floyd Patterson fight.
You're great.
Well, I just got the one punch.
That's all you need, slugger.
If you ever wanna turn pro, just let me know.
You could make a fortune.
Oh Make Make a fortune?
I'll tell you what, I'll be your manager.
You'll be the greatest fighter since John L. Sullivan.
Since who?
Since, uh, John L. Quarry.
J-Jerry Quarry.
Say Hey, listen, the fight's not till 7:00.
Why don't you join Roger and I. We'll go over to the Club and have dinner.
You're gonna eat dinner before a fight?
Well, is that wrong?
Oh, you're unbelievable.
I'm always too nervous to eat before a bout.
Oh, well, there's nothing to be nervous about.
I mean, I got the one punch.
You sure have, slugger.
You go ahead.
I'll meet you back here at 6:30.
Okay, right.
But eat light just in case Culligan gets lucky and lands one in your breadbasket.
My breadba Oh, yeah, my breadbasket.
All right.
Yeah.
Breadbasket.
Oh, somebody please let me out.
Help!
They will kill him.
Ha, ha, ha.
I can't wait to see this fight, gentlemen.
Would you like to up the bet another hundred, Gutsy?
I'll cover anything you've got.
I'll take 50 of that, general.
You're on, doctor.
Oh, I hate to take your money, gentlemen.
Culligan hasn't lost in 240 fights.
There's not a man in the armed forces who can touch him.
Well, we've got one.
One-Punch Nelson.
Never heard of him.
You will.
In fact, here he is now.
Major Nelson.
Would you come over here, please?
Hello, major.
Sir.
General.
Major, I'd like you to meet General Gorman.
General Gorman.
Pleasure, sir.
How do you do?
Wanna make it another hundred?
Oh, are you betting $100 on me, sir?
Against you.
Heh.
Yes.
Yes, of course.
You're on, Gutsy.
You're on.
Tell me, uh, major, how do you plan to handle Culligan?
No.
Ha, ha, ha.
You don't have to worry about me hurting your boy, sir.
I plan on carrying him for the first few rounds, just to make it look good, and then finish him off around the fifth.
That's telling him, champ.
Careful, Roge.
That's the old breadbasket.
Roge, will you pull yourself together?
Sorry.
There.
I'm ticklish.
Sit down.
Yeah.
No, no, it's all right.
Come on, look a little professional, huh?
All right, now you gotta relax.
Where's Jeannie?
I don't know.
I called home and nobody answered.
Gee, you'd think she'd wanna be here to see me win.
Huh?
Well, she probably figured it wouldn't be much of a contest.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's probably it.
Someone please let me out.
Oh, my master will be murdered if I do not help him.
Where's Culligan?
He's making you wait.
It's an old trick to make you nervous.
Yeah, well, it's working.
On me.
Heh, relax, Roge.
Ten minutes, it'll all be over.
That's the old confidence, slugger.
You knocked me out with one punch.
If you can do that to me, you can do it to him.
I'll rip him apart.
Yeah, rip him apart.
That's Culligan?
Poor devil.
Poor devil?
He's built like a fort.
The bigger they are, the harder they fall, Roge.
If he falls on you, you'll go through the floor.
You can't fight that guy.
Heh.
Take it easy.
He's not gonna lay a finger on me.
Yeah, I'm not worried about his finger, I'm worried about his fists.
They're like hams.
If the going gets too rough, we throw in the towel.
Yeah, well, the going is rough.
Give me the towel.
Will you stop that?
Can I change your mind?
No.
Then I'm gonna change my bet.
Now, come on.
We can win this thing.
That's easy for you to say.
You're Jerry Quarry.
Will you guys take it easy?
I'll take care of him.
Yeah, you'll take care of him, all right.
And now the main event of the evening: The heavyweight championship of the armed forces.
In this corner, weighing 190 pounds, representing the Air Force, the challenger, One-Punch Nelson.
And in this corner, weighing 230 pounds, representing the Marine Corps, the champion of the armed forces, Killer Culligan.
You sure he can do it, Jer?
Sure I'm sure.
But keep the towel ready just in case.
You got the towel.
Oh, that's right.
That's right.
Keep the towel, Jerry.
Uh, last chance to up your bet.
Any amount you say, Gutsy.
You just name it.
Oh, it might be wiser to leave things as they are.
Hey, uh, hey, Jerry.
I did knock you out, didn't I?
Sure you did, slugger.
Okay.
I'll murder the bum.
Yeah.
Sink that left hand.
Jab, now.
Jab.
Okay.
Start counting.
What for?
Nobody's down yet.
That was his best punch and it didn't even faze him.
Sure it did.
He's just covering up.
That was my punch.
That was it.
Can we talk this over?
He's doing a good job of covering up.
You'd hardly know he was losing.
Come on.
Mix it up, now.
Come on.
No, wait a minute, wait a minute.

Can we talk about this?
Come on.

Come on.
Fight, will ya?
Come on.
Attaboy, get in there!

What a punch he hit him with.
What?
What's the matter?
Oh!
Oh, master.
But I saw you knock him out.
You couldn't have.
You weren't even there.
Oh, yes, you were there.
You were there.
Eh, how stupid could I be?
When I broke the table this mor And And I I put my fist through the door.
Oh, but that was to give you confidence.
And when I knocked out Culligan just now?
Oh, well, master, that was to save your life.
Oh.

I fell for it.
One-Punch Nelson.
What's going on?
What are you talking about?
Oh, Jerry, you wouldn't believe it if I told you.
Well, try me.

No, no, no.
I cannot do that.
Master Go ahead.
Punch him.
Punch him?

Oh!
I am sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Yes, sir.
Right, sir.
Well, I've got that taken care of, sir.
Yeah, well, uh, Major Healey ought to be here any minute.
He called before he left.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's the  Uh, that's the, uh, vacuum cleaner, sir.
Yes, uh, my housekeeper's just kind of straightening things up.
Housekeeper?
Uh, major, I thought you realized that for the duration of this test you and Major Healey are to have no outside help.
Well, the idea is to see whether you two are compatible as a team together in close quarters, completely on your own.
Amanda, please.
Yeah, well, she's leaving, sir, just as soon as she finishes.
Well, I've given her the week off.
All right, major.
Just remember: whether you and Healey ever get to the moon together depends in part on how you get along this week.
Uh, good luck.
Right, sir.
Don't worry about a thing.
Amanda, would you mind telling me why you find it necessary to clean over here when I'm in the middle of an important phone call?
Because, darling, we don't have a housekeeper.
Oh, but, master, you have never had a roommate before.
You are used to doing things your own way.
And so is Major Healey.
Yeah.
You will quarrel.
You will fight.
Now, don't be ridiculous.
A terrible fight.
If two grown men can't live in a house together alone for a we Look, I've got everything set up.
I've got a rollaway in the bedroom, I've emptied two drawers and half a closet and I've I've typed up a schedule of cooking assignments and household chores.
The whole thing is order and discipline, see?
It will never work without me.
It would be so much easier if you would let me do it.
Jeannie, there's nothing to be done.
Everything's fine.
Now you go visit your relatives, and have a good time.
I'll miss ya.
Yes, master, you will.
Hey, Roge.
Good morning, roommate.
Boy, is this going to be an easy assignment.
Yeah, piece of cake.
Let me get you moved in.
Yeah.
Okay, kids.
Bring it in.
Hi.
How do you like my moving ladies?
Roger, you're moving in for a week, not a year.
I know.
That's why I decided to travel light.
Oh!
Be careful of my jigsaw puzzle of the Battle of Gettysburg.
Ah!
Nice kids.
And a lot cheaper than a moving company.
Roger, look, what is all this stuff?
Uh, uh, uh, tennis racquets and ski poles, footballs, puzzles, all kinds of What did you bring all this junk for?
Well, I thought I might get bored.
Bored?
Look, we're not rooming together for a whole week to keep you entertained.
This is a test And a very important test, I might add.
To see if we can get along.
I know, Tony, ahem, and right now you're flunking it.
I'm flunking it?
And what about you?
Look at all this Yeah, Roge, you're right.
If people are gonna live together, they gotta compromise.
They gotta make allowances, right?
Why don't you, uh, well, move all this stuff into the other room, and we'll just forget about it, huh?
Hey, where's my Pickett's beard?
What?
Pickett's beard, it's part of my jigsaw puzzle.
It was shaped like a horseshoe.
It goes right here.
Oh!
Wait, wait.
What are you gonna do?
You can do the Battle of Gettysburg at another time.
Right now I'm gonna get organized.
I worked for two weeks on that, now hold it Stop!
Whoo!
Roger.
Is this yours?
You You broke my puzzle.
Monday night: Tony does dishes, Roger cooks.
Tuesday night: Tony cleans up.
Why do we have to have a schedule?
Why?
Why can't we just play it by ear?
Roger, I had a roommate in college, and we found out that everything worked out a lot better when we had a specific schedule of assignments.
Okay.
You're doing the cooking, I'll I'll do the dishes.
That's right.
And, uh, tomorrow, you do the cooking and I do the dishes, right?
Mm-hm.
I got it all down here on black and white, see?
So that way, there'll be no arguments.
What are you making, anyway?
Well, it's, uh, kind of a specialty of mine.
I hope you like it.
Oh, I'm not a fussy eater.
I mean, there's only one thing I can't stand.
And it's tuna casserole.
That's the one thing I  Mm-mm.
Say, Roge.
Yeah.
Why?
Why don't you go in the kitchen and do the dishes?
I'm sorry.
What did you say?
Why don't you go in the kitchen and do the dishes?
You see, it's, uh, your turn.
Fine.
You make a lousy casserole I can't even eat, and I gotta clean it up.
Well, a schedule's a schedule, you know.
All right, I'll go and clean up the kitchen, but you've gotta get lost later.
Get lost?
I've got a girl coming later and we'd like to be alone.
Well, Roger, I've got a lot of work Hey, it's my house.
And this is the porch light schedule right here.
Porch light schedule?
Mm-hm.
When the light is on, you stay away, and when the light is off, well, you can come in.
It's a little system that college roommate and I had worked out.
Mm-hm.
Monday night, Roger.
Tuesday night, Tony.
I don't have anybody coming in on Tuesday night.
Maybe you can work that out when you're out of the house.
Roger!
Ah!
A schedule's a schedule.
Set 'em up again, Joe.
I, uh, think you've had enough, Major Nelson.
Again, Joe, and make it a double.
You keep this up, uh, you're gonna have to go on a diet.
That's the least of my problems.
You?
You dial that number again?
Yeah, I did, and it's still busy.
Oh, yeah!
That's it.
Not only am I evicted from my own house, but my phone bills are being run into the millions.
I know how it is.
My dad's always griping at my mom for using the phone too much.
Roger you've had it.
Roger?
Sheesh!
The older generation's really fouled up.
Roger?
Roger.
I-I don't mean to disturb you, but I gotta get some sleep.
Roge?
Roge?
Oh!
Will you take it easy?
I got in here first.
Shh.
Where's Rosa?
Oh, she left hours ago.
We finished our rigging.
Huh?
We finished our rigging the boat.
Well, then why is the front porch light still on?
I always leave it on.
It keeps away burglars.
It keeps away burglars?
W-what about the signal?
Your schedule?
Oh, that.
Oh, is that why?
Is that why you didn't come in?
Yeah!
Oh, I'm sorry.
My fault.
Just Just a little mistake.
I'll take the boat.
Night-night.
I can't believe it.
He keeps me wandering around out there for five hours while he's got the porch light on.
And meanwhile, burglars   Not mad, are you?
I gotta hand it to you, Roger.
This meal has been fantastic.
Thank you.
I just wanted to make up for that little misunderstanding we had the other night.
Well Well, you sure did.
You put my tuna fish casserole to shame.
And just to let you know I stick to my bargain, the house is yours tonight.
Oh.
Well, I'm not gonna be doing anything.
I'm just gonna do the dishes and watch a little TV.
You don't have to go anyplace.
No, no, no.
A schedule's a schedule.
Anyway, I've got a date tonight.
Ah, okay.
Well, have fun.
Mine's broken.
Hi, Joe.
Is my usual ready?
Coming right up, Dr. Bellows.
Say, uh, you just missed Major Nelson.
Major Nelson, in here?
And boy, has he got problems.
Uh, with his roommate.
They, uh, don't get along.
Oh, I see.
Thanks for telling me, Joe.
Thanks very much.
Oh!
Why, this is terrible.
I knew my master could not do without me.
Ah.
There.
Well, now at least the house is clean.
I bet he's not been eating properly, either.
Yuck.
Well.
There.
Now at least they will be more comfortable in a clean house.
Oh, but what good is it?
They will just get it filthy again.
JEANNIE : My master should not have to think about silly little things like cleaning the house and fixing meals.
He will find it much easier to be compatible with Major Healey if I fix the house.
There.
Now the house is fully automatic.
Still asleep at 10:30?
Ten-thirty.
Ten-thirty?
Oh, yes.
My My alarm clock's broken.
May I come in, major?
There are a few things I'd like to discuss with you and Major Healey.
I-I don't think now is The place is a pigsty, sir.
I rather you What are you talking about?
This room is immaculate.
I could have sworn it was an absolute Oh, stop mumbling, major.
There's something important I'd like to talk to you about.
I hear that you and Major Healey are not getting along together.
Oh, s Really?
Where did you get that information, sir?
We're getting along fine.
Hm.
That's not what my informant tells me.
Hm.
And I have decided, from now on, to, uh, split you as a team.
Sir, you can't split us Unless I see by your behavior within the next 24 hours that you're completely compatible.
Oh, compatible?
We're always compatible Oh!
Good morning, Tony.
Boy, I wish I had a cup of coffee.
Oh, good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Ah, good morning, major.
Boy, well, that's service for you.
What's the matter with you, Major Nelson?
Well, he always gets clumsy before his morning coffee.
Where'd that coffee come from?
Yeah.
Where did that coffee cup come from?
Major Nelson, did you see that?
That coffee cup just appeared in Major Healey's hand.
Oh, no, no, no, sir.
He had it when he came in.
He drinks coffee in bed.
No, I don't.
I just said I wish I Ooh.
Uh, yes, uh This is last night's coffee, sir.
He's very neat.
He was taking it to the kitchen.
If it's last night's coffee, why is it steaming?
Steaming?
No, it's not steaming.
It's ice cold, sir.
See?
I Ice cold.
Major.
Give me that, hm?
Oh.
Augh!
Major.
Ah!
Oh!
I'm sorry.
It's ice cold.
See, I said it was ice cold.
Then why is he leaping around as if he's got a hotfoot?
Well, ice cold coffee, sir, first thing in the morning.
You'd leap around too.
Tony.
Hm?
Why did you do that?
Uh, it was an accident, Roge.
I'm terribly sorry.
No, it wasn't.
You deliberately spilled Well, I see it's unnecessary for me to stay with you as I had planned.
Obviously, you both cannot work together.
Roge, he's gonna split us up.
Yeah, he can't do that.
We're buddies, you know?
It doesn't look like that to him.
Hi.
As of tomorrow, you will both find a new partner.
Oh, Dr. Bellows, you're making a big mistake.
W-We're crazy about each other.
Oh?
Is that why Major Nelson stepped on your foot, spilled coffee all over you and elbowed you in the stomach?
Well, actually, we were just fooling around.
Ha, ha, ha.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Like a You know, just roughhousing like a couple of college kids.
Blowing off a little steam.
I give Roger a little poke in the stomach.
You know, just playing around.
Yeah, just Just playing, hit me right Said he's playing around and I just gave him a little kick in the shins.
Hey, that was pretty fast.
Ah, yeah.
Ha, ha.
Then I just took my fist and I just, I tear you  All right, gentlemen, all right.
I'll put off my decision for 24 hours.
But, uh, during that time I'll stay with you and observe every nuance of your relationship.
Oh.
Great, sir.
Great, sir.
Happy to have you aboard.
I'm happy if you're happy.
Ooh.
Well, is she here?
Shh.
Dr. Bellows is upstairs.
He might hear.
I looked all over the house.
I can't find her.
Then how did the kitchen get cleaned up?
How did the living room get cleaned up?
How did I get my cup of coffee?
If she isn't here, we must have elves.
No, I-I think I know what happened.
Before Jeannie left, she wanted to fix the house so that I-if we wanted anything, all we had to do was ask and it'd be done.
You mean the house is automatic?
I think so.
Well, why don't we give it a test?
All right.
Uh Um, I wish I had, um I wish I had an apple.
Hey, that's great.
Hey, wait a minute.
What kind of test is that?
Let me give it a test.
Uh, I'd like a beautiful redhead.
Oh, Roge.
Yeah.
Uh, ha, hello.
Hello.
Ha, ha.
Hello.
There There's been kind of a little misunderstanding here.
I I wish you'd Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Let's What's the rush, huh?
Roger.
I wish you'd disappear.
Roger?
What did I say?
I said Roger, I wish you'd disap What's the matter with me?
I like you better anyway.
Yeah?
Yeah, I Look, I-I think there's a little misunderstanding here.
Uh, there's been some kind of a mistake.
Um, I Roger?
I wish you'd come back.
Ah, just what I thought.
You wanted her for yourself, huh?
Roger, I wish you'd shut up.
Now, I'm sorry, miss.
There really has been a misunderstanding.
Here.
Have an apple.
Now disappear.
Oh.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
Heh, Roger, boy, are we in trouble.
We got 24 hours to convince Dr. Bellows that we're compatible, and we got a nutty house on our hands.
Well, don't just stand there.
Say something!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I wish you could speak.
Thank you.
Now Now, look, we're gonna have to function like a well-oiled machine.
And above all, we've got to avoid using terms like, um, "I wish" or "I want".
Well, I certainly wish that we could have someone Sh!
Now, what did I just tell you?
I was just going to wish us luck.
Breakfast is served, sir.
Amazing!
Absolutely amazing.
After you.
After you.
No, after you.
All right.
Major Nelson?
Major Healey?
I'm ready now.
Oh?
I thought you'd be staying the night with us, sir.
Well, there's no need now.
It's obvious that I misjudged you two completely.
You're as compatible and efficient a team as I've ever seen.
You mean the test is over, sir?
Well, as far as I'm concerned it is, and you've both passed with flying colors.
Well, uh, it's certainly been a pleasure having you.
That goes double for me, sir.
There's just one thing that still puzzles me: Why you were arguing this morning over a simple little thing like a cup of coffee.
I wish you'd tell me the truth about that.
I'll tell you the truth, sir.
Roger Healey is a slob.
He came here with enough stuff for a year and dumped it on my living-room floor and generally made this place look like a pigsty.
Major Nelson, what are you saying?
I don't know.
Yeah, well, I know.
I may be a slob, but that's better than being a nitpicking list-maker!
I mean, he has a schedule for everything.
A schedule for cooking, for washing the dishes.
He even has a schedule for when we schedule things.
Well, I stayed out there half the night waiting for you to turn the porch light on.
Gentlemen, please!
All he can make is a lousy casserole!
And when you cook, you make it look like it's been hit by Hurricane Zelda!
I You left it like it looks like Gentlemen.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, will you please stop arguing?
You almost had me convinced, didn't you?
Well, the truth will come out.
After tomorrow, you'll find out that there's no necessity of working together anymore.
Dr. Bellows.
I'm sorry, Roge.
You're sorry?
I'm sorry.
I don't know what happened.
It just came rushing out.
I feel terrible.
I wish the roof would fall in.
Who did that?
Not bad.
Master, Major Healey, I'm back.
Yes, I sense that, Jeannie.
Well, are you not happy to see me?
Did you not miss me?
We missed you, but you didn't miss us.
Well, I-I do not understand.
Well, uh, Jeannie, uh, uh Your automatic house caused Roger and I to have an argument and Dr. Bellows saw it, and he's splitting us up as a team.
Well, that is terrible.
Just because you had a little fight?
Well, that could happen to anyone.
Yeah, I know, but it Unfortunately, it happened to us.
And at a very inopportune time.
Say, it could happen to anyone, couldn't it?
I've got a little job for you.
Darling, what on Earth?
What's the matter?
You look terrible.
I have a very unpleasant chore to perform tomorrow.
I have to split up Major Nelson and Major Healey.
Split them up?
What?
What on Earth for?
Ahh.
They hate each other.
Oh, darling, I can't believe that.
I just saw them almost come to blows over a silly little thing like a cup of coffee.
No wonder you're so depressed.
Well, you just sit there.
I've got the martinis all ready for you.
Thank you, dear.
Here you are, sweetheart.
Thanks.
Mm-hm.
Mm.
Amanda, this martini is terrible.
That's the way I've always prepared it, dear.
Yes, and they've always been terrible.
I'm sorry, darling.
I I'll go fix you another one.
Mm.
No, I won't, either.
You don't like the martini?
You go fix it yourself.
When a man comes home from a hard day's work he deserves a decent martini!
Don't shout at me, Alfred!
I'll shout if I want to!
Yes?
What is it?
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows, uh, we just dropped by to see if we could persuade you to reconsider your decision.
Yes, sir.
Anybody could have a fight.
Yeah.
Oh, what's wrong with Mrs. Bellows?
Uh, Major Nelson, Major Healey, I, um I'm just in the middle of a I'm afraid you've come at the wrong time.
Go ahead and tell them!
We just had a A knock-down-drag-out fight.
Well, I-I sure hope you're not considering separating.
Well, of course not.
Whatever gave you that silly idea?
You may have a point, major.
Just because you have a little tiff, it doesn't mean the roof has to fall in.
No.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}

Um, uh, Dr. Bellows, whatever I did, I'm sure I have an explanation.

Certainly, master.
Thanks.

I think we should start over.
I'm Valerie Thomas.
Tony Nelson.
Hi.
I never can get these things buckled.
Heh.
Oh, let me help you.
Ooh.
I can't seem to get it loose.
I'm sorry, but you should have buzzed.
I couldn't reach the button.
I hope you'll be more comfortable.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Please don't say anything.
I'm embarrassed enough as it is.
Here, let me move your chair back for you.
You'll be more comfortable that way.
Coffee, tea or punch?
I'll have some fruit punch, please.
Oh, make that two, please.
Would you mind passing these over?
No.
Thank you.
Wait.
Hold it.
Stop right there.
I'll take it.
Stewardess, may I have a pillow?
Jeannie!
Oh!
I don't know who you are but you shouldn't be allowed out without your keeper!
What are you doing here?
I am celebrating our anniversary.
Oh, yeah.
Jeannie, I'm sorry.
I'm I'm kind of tied up now.
Would you?
Would you go home?
Yes, master.
Good.
Have a good time in Washington.
I'm not going to Washington to have a good time.
Oh?
Then why are you going?
This is the reason I'm going.
It's a can of film.
A movie.
Dr. Bellows ordered me to take it.
You mean you ruined our anniversary, made me the unhappiest genie in the universe, and just for a silly little old can of film?
It's not a silly little old can of You're right.
You're right.
It's just a silly little old can of film.
Well, not anymore it is not.
What have you done?
What did you do to this film?
Major Nelson.
Goodbye, master.
Shh.
Major Nelson.
Yes, sir.
What are you doing in here?
Where is she?
We're not supposed to know each other, remember?
But that stewardess you were here with?
There's no stewardess, sir.
Please, sir, you're violating security regulations.
I told you to get off this plane.
I was just giving this man some Get off this plane right now.
I don't have to tell you how we've been looking forward to this film, Dr. Bellows.
And if I may say so, what you're gonna see is really gonna be an eye opener.
Right, major.
I hope so, sir, yes.
Major.
Uh, general.
Oh, uh, general Uh, perhaps it'd be good idea if I ran the film alone first, sir.
Oh, nonsense, major.
We'll look at it together.
Shall we, gentlemen?
Oh, uh, major?
Yeah?
NARRATOR : The film you are about to see was made under the most carefully guarded conditions at NASA headquarters.
It contains some of the top-secret, up-to-date activities of the space agency.
What are we doing at NASA?
Let's take a look.
The past is forgotten.
The future will be bright and promising before us.
New men, new equipment, new horizons to conquer.
This experimental model of the TBF-60 is a far cry from man's first primitive attempt to imitate the birds.
Through dedication and daring of men like these we at NASA are looking not to the clouds but to the very stars.
Take a look at another top-secret, experimental prototype.
While still in a developmental stage, its future in the exploration of outer space is unlimited.
Because of this powerful new orbital device our astronaut training program has been completely revised.
Very few men can pass this rigid test.
Here you see a flight into the future.
The vehicle that one day will take us to Jupiter and Mars.
Other nations are working on a spaceship like this.
But we at NASA are several years ahead of them.
Note the radically new method of launching the vehicle into orbit.
Major Nelson, what's going on here?
I can't say, sir.
Is that the film I turned over to you?
It never left my wrist.
Before we can look forward to reaching outer planets, and finally the stars, we must first conquer the problem of soft landing on the moon.
Here, we see such a landing.
Note the easy, graceful initial stage.
The spacecraft takes advantage of artificially induced air currents to glide to a perfect three-point landing.
Here is a perfect example of a new breed of men.
The men who will one day make space travel as safe as walking to the corner store.
We've heard about enough of this!
Stop the film!
Colonel, I want to know the meaning of this.
So do I, general.
I flew in from Germany to see this film.
I don't know what the White House is gonna say.
I'll tell you what I say: I'm going to demand a congressional investigation and a formal court-martial, and you two are history.
I'm sorry.
Don't sit there, say something.
What do I say, sir?
Major.
Yes, sir.
Uh, I know what you're thinking, and you're wrong.
Uh, I mean it's It's not what you're thinking.
Actually, what I mean is, if I could get to a phone I could explain.
There's one in the corner.
I, uh, beg your pardon?
In the corner.
Yes.
Thank you very much.
Gentlemen, gentlemen, please be patient.
Uh, you'll be amused to hear how simple his explanation is.
It's too bad, uh, Tony isn't here on his anniversary to, uh, join in, in all the fun.
You would not leave me to celebrate our third anniversary with another woman.
Or our fourth.
Or our fourth.
Jeannie, if this is a proposal, I accept.
Why don't you whip up a nice chateau to get married in, and then maybe we can get about 12 beautiful bridesmaids  Hello?
Oh, hello.
Jeannie?
I am sorry, master, but I am busy planning my wedding.
Well, Major Nelson, what's holding you up?
Nothing, sir.
It was the wrong number.
I'll try again.
Look, I don't want anything too elaborate.
Maybe a Caribbean cruise on my new yacht.
I wish he would stop interrupting.
I will tell him.
Jeannie, don't hang up.
I need you.
I am sorry, master, but I am very busy planning my honeymoon.
If you need help, ask Marion to do it.
Marion?
Mm, eh What's Sergeant Marion got to do with it?
How do you know about him?
Him?
Jeannie, uh, what's the matter with you?
Oh.
Oh, I am sorry, master.
But I think I am on the wrong honeymoon.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
What about our wedding?
Always a bridesmaid.
Well, Major Nelson, do you have an explanation or don't you?
Well, sir, I'm afraid Master.
Jeannie?
Well?
Oh, master, how can you ever forgive me?
I thought you and Marion were Never mind that, Jeannie.
Can you put the film back?
And on our anniversary.
Oh, I will never forgive myself.
Well, we're waiting, Major Nelson.
Jeannie, can you fix the film?
Oh, yes, master, I can fix it.
I think you better explain all this, Major Nelson.
Yes, of course, sir.
Uh, gentlemen, please, may I have your attention?
Uh, I've just talked to Dr. Eugene Oglethorpe, the chief of this project, and he explained the whole thing to me.
Dr. Oglethorpe says that this room was wired in advance and all our reactions have been recorded to be studied later by NASA researchers.
Good.
Very good, major.
So if you would please take your seats we'll be able to show you the film you came to see.
I don't believe a word of that story, but I'll discuss it with you later.
Are you sure we're gonna see the proper film now?
Absolutely, sir.
Mmm.

Whoo-oo Jeannie?
Sister, darling.
Oh, that'd be almost too easy.
Gotcha.
Oh, Jeannie.
Really, darling.
After all the times you've been trapped in there I would've thought you'd have devised some sort of early-warning system.
Jeannie, you You let me out of here or I'll tell Mama!
My goodness, can't you take a joke?
What are you doing here in Cocoa Beach?
I missed you, sister dear.
Did you?
Terribly.
I also wanted to know what was going on with that gorgeous master of yours.
Are you married yet?
Not yet.
I do not know what the matter is.
I read all the magazines.
I do exactly what they say.
Hmm.
Magazines.
What do they know?
Darling, what you need is a good, strong love potion.
Oh, no.
I would not want my master to marry me unless it was of his own free will.
Sis, wake up.
No man gets married of his own free will.
They have to be led, persuaded, cajoled.
You have to dangle a carrot in front of their nose.
Oh, but my master does not like carrots.
Darling.
You can make a man eat shredded cardboard if you know the right tricks.
Do you know the right tricks?
Mm-hm.
Well, I should.
I've been married 47 times.
I'll tell you what.
Just to show you there are no hard feelings I'm going to give you a personalized course in how to marry a man.
I'm going to go after a man and let you watch and see how I hook him.
You are going to get married?
Sure.
Forty-seven, 48, what's the difference?
And you can take notes on what I do.
But whom will you marry?
Oh, I don't know.
I'll I'll find someone.
Tony?
Oh-oh?
Anybody home?
Oh, it is Major Healey.
Mmm.
He'll do.
I'll marry him.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Where's Tony?
I was supposed to pick him up.
He went to the base, Major Healey.
H-h-he said to tell you that he had to go in early.
Is, uh?
Is anything wrong?
Hmm?
Oh, no.
No.
Oh, well, I'll I'll catch him at the office.
Bye.
See you.
Here comes the bride Here comes the bride It is out of the question.
You cannot marry Major Healey.
Why sis, you know I've always been a fool about astronauts.
And besides, he is kind of cute.
But he is my master's best friend.
Look at it this way, sis: If I marry Major Healey, you won't have to worry about me stealing Major Nelson away from you.
Oh.
Hey, Roge, do you, uh, suppose you could arrange to use the phone in your office?
The switchboard operator's madly in love with me and I don't wanna make her jealous.
Four-five-four-oh-oh-five-two.
Five-eight-three Four-five-nine-three-six-five.
six-five-four-seven.
Hello, Joannie?
This is pussycat.
Major Nelson, what's going on in here?
I "Pussycat"?
Oh, major, I don't think pussycat is a good enough code word for our project.
Maybe another one.
Right.
A new code word, sir.
Working on a project.
Major Healey, have you been using this phone for the last half hour?
Yes, sir, on official business, sir.
I've got a lot of work to do.
Nose to wheel, shoulder to the grindstone.
Major, it's nose to the grindstone and shoulder to the wheel.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, Joannie?
Yes.
Is that a new one?
Oh, uh, that's his new girl Friday.
As opposed to his girl Thursday and girl Wednesday and girl Tues  Well I think it'd be a good idea if Major Healey got married and settled down.
He devotes so much energy to girl-hunting.
I don't think Roger will be getting married, sir.
It'd take a pretty sharp girl to nail him down.
Well, perhaps.
Oh, by the way, major, about that simulator report  I'm in the midst of it now.
I'm on the last equation.
If I can just get it down.
I have the I have the last Hello?
No, Joannie, this is not pussycat.
You can find him at extension six-seven-two Oh-oh-five-seven.
five-seven-four-three.
If not there, try extension two-oh-four Well, now, time to start you lessons.
Do you have a drachma, darling?
Yes.
Put it in.
Let's see what Major Healey is doing.
Agnes getting married.
Let me see Oh, hi, Jane.
Listen, I was wondering, are you doing anything Saturday ni?
Scratch Jane out.
Jane's out.
Let me see The switchboard operator.
What's that?
No, no.
She listens in on all my calls.
How about Ellie Mae?
I must be dreaming.
On the other hand, who cares?
Hello.
I'm, uh I'm Major Healey.
I'm an astronaut.
That's a very pretty dress you've got.
Uh, it's not Jeannie's sister.
If you're going to blink me to Siberia, give me a nice warm coat.
Last time you blinked me there, I I got frostbite and almost froze to death.
Darling, I'm not going to blink you anywhere.
I want you right here close to me.
I know what you want.
I know, you want Major Nelson.
And you want me to get him for you.
You're not gonna get him through me, because he's my best friend.
Darling, I don't want Major Nelson at all.
It's only you I'm interested in.
You I'm mad about.
Yeah, you're mad about me.
That's a joke.
Well, after all, what does Major Nelson have that you haven't?
Well, to begin with, he has a genie.
And if you don't get me down from this swing, I'm gonna tell Now, come on.
Will you cut that out?
Darling, what do I have to do to prove to you I adore you?
Well, to begin with, you can disappear.
Oh, your wish is my command, master.
She's gone.
Well, he's taken the bait.
But he does not want you.
He asked you to disappear.
Oh, yeah?
Watch and see what happens next.
Well, I guess I showed her.
Anyway, who wants a genie hanging around to do things for you, like Who wants a genie hanging around?
Come back here.
Come back!
I thought you'd never ask.
Do you, uh?
Do you really like me?
Oh, how can you doubt it, darling?
Well, what if I asked you to blink up a Rolls-Royce.
What would you say to that?
I would say nothing.
I would merely ask you to turn your head and look over there.
A Rolls-Royce car.
How about a matching yacht?
Hmm.
I think I'm falling in love.
I'd like to hang around here, but I have to go back to NASA.
Gotta get to work.
I've got a few things I'd like Maybe we could meet for lunch and I could make out a list.
Certainly, darling.
You did it, sister.
You did it!
Oh, I can hardly wait to try out all those things on my master.
Jeannie?
Jeannie, are you here?
Jeannie?
Hey, Jeannie, where have you taken me now?
Master.
Oh, dear.
I've done something wrong.
Lesson number two: How to do little things for your master.
Keep your eyes peeled, darling.
Yes, sister.
One golf bag.
One golf club.
The Miami Beach Golf Club.
And one ballpoint pen.
Hello, master, darling.
Are you ready to take me to lunch?
I thought we'd send out for something to Oh, dear, you popped your button off.
I have?
Oh, let me fix it for you.
You mean, you're gonna sew it on by hand?
Of course, darling.
I love to do little things for you.
I hope you don't mind, dear.
I decided to make supper for us, myself.
Again?
Yes.
If I blinked it up, it wouldn't have seemed as personal, somehow.
You mean, you wanted to make dinner for me with your own little hands?
Mmm.
That's the most beautiful thing I ever heard of in my whole life.
It's my specialty.
I hope you like it.
Do you like it?
It's the most delicious thing I've ever had my whole life.
What is it?
Shredded cardboard.
It's delicious.
More, more.
Oh!
Now, what's the surprise you got for me, Jeannie?
You will see, master.
I made it with my own hands.
Taste it.
You do not like it?
It tastes like shredded cardboard.
Oh, Tony.
Oh, Jeannie.
Hi, Roge.
Oh, have I got news for you.
What happened?
Just the greatest thing in my whole life.
Wow, I've never seen him so happy.
Roger, that's Jeannie's sister next to you.
Jeannie, that's your sister.
Will you do something?
Tony, will you relax?
I've been trying to tell you.
Jeannie's sister and I are getting married.
Wait a minute.
Would you relax?
Just relax, huh?
Have another cup of coffee.
Tony, I've gotta go.
Jeannie's waiting for me.
She gets lonely without me.
Well, she can talk to her sister.
She can tell her about the time she sent you to Saudi Arabia.
Well, she didn't know me then.
How about the time she blinked you to Africa and you were attacked by that tribe of Pygmies?
Oh, we were just acquaintances.
Well, how about that time she blinked you to Siberia without a coat?
And you got frostbite, and you almost froze to death?
Well, nobody likes a goody two-shoes.
Besides, how come you're the only one who can have a genie?
I'm basing this on many years with a genie.
You can't go through with this.
I can't, huh?
Well, I'll tell you what: You just watch me.
Are you sure this is the appropriate thing to get married in?
Maybe you're right, darling.
It is a bit too conservative.
Mmm.
Perhaps I'll add a few, uh, sequins.
Jeannie, this is a military wedding.
Oh, very well.
I'll throw in a couple of medals.
Jeannie, just a simple uniform would be fine.
Oh, whatever you wish, master.
In, uh, cashmere.
Well, that settles that.
What about the cake?
We gonna have a big one?
Oh, don't worry.
Everything's been ordered.
A people-shaped cake?
Oh, don't be silly, darling.
They're for the top.
Oh, the top Oh, we're gonna have a big cake.
I'm going to be maid of honor.
Do you like my outfit, master?
Jeannie, Roger cannot marry your sister.
It's impossible.
I am sorry you feel that way about astronauts marrying genies.
It has nothing to do with astronauts marrying genies.
It has to do with Roger marrying your sister.
Well, I mean, she's not your ordinary, everyday genie.
Major Healey is over 21.
And your sister?
She is over 2021.
How can you argue with that?
We must not interfere with their lives.
Ha!
But she tricked him somehow.
Oh, no, she did not, master.
She merely made him fall in love with her like any woman makes any man fall in love.
But when I tried it on you  it did not work.
Oh, now, come on.
Now Now, stop that.
Now, don't you start crying.
I really can't take that.
You I'd I'd like to explain.
Go away, master.
I do not wish to discuss this.
You see Roger, please, listen to me before it's too late.
There's nothing more to say.
Now, either you want to be my best man or you don't.
Well, of course I want to be your best man.
But I want you to be sure you're doing the right thing.
Will you stop worrying?
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
You talked to your mother?
Yeah.
Yeah, what'd you tell her?
When I told her Jeannie's family was the founders of the Baghdad Country Club, she was pleased as punch.
You said what?
Major Nelson, you were to be in my office at 2:00.
Right on my way.
Oh, by the way, major, I spoke to Mrs. Bellows and she's absolutely delighted with the idea.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
What was that you talked to Mrs. Bellows about?
What idea was that, Roger?
Major?
Major?
Uh, yes.
Oh, major, here's the report I talked to you about.
Uh, yeah, thank you, sir.
Uh, what was Mrs. Bellows so delighted about?
Major Healey's wedding.
We're having it in our garden.
I don't think that's a good idea.
And why not?
Well, she mustn't marry him, sir.
She doesn't love him.
She's just using Roger to get to me.
Major Healey's fiancÃ©e is in love with you?
Well, not exactly in love, sir.
She just wants to own me.
Own you.
Oh, well, I mean, uh, like a pet, you know?
A pet?
You mean like a puppy dog or a parakeet?
That's it exactly, sir.
She tried it before.
I didn't let her.
She's just using Roger.
You understand?
Oh, yes, major.
I understand perfectly.
The shock of thinking about your best friend getting married has caused certain delusions.
We'll go into those further after the wedding.
Oh, no, that's what Now, as for the wedding itself, I, uh I want you to behave as a best man and a best friend should.
Do you understand, major?
Do I underst?
You don't understand.
This girl lives in a She She comes from a totally alien environment.
She's a She's a Shall we begin, major?
You get the ring?
I got it.
Boy, am I nervous.
You're nervous.
I'm terrified.
I still haven't seen the bride yet.
Neither have I. But Major Healey says she's quite beautiful.
Major Nelson doesn't look very happy.
I know.
He feels he's losing his best friend.
That's ridiculous.
You men are so clannish.
Join hands, please.
"Dearly beloved "we are gathered here to consecrate "the holy bond of matrimony.
"Is there anyone in this assemblage "who knows of any reason why this marriage should not take place"?
Ahem.
No.
Do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife?
I do.
Amanda.
Look up there and tell me what you see.
I can't see anything.
My mascara's running.
There seems to be some mistake.
Get on with it.
He said I do.
I knew it.
I knew it.
She's trying to marry me.
Jeannie, would you?
You were right.
Alfred, for heaven's sake, why don't you wear your glasses?
But I could have sworn You know, I think I'm catching Major Nelson's delusions.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here Oh, no, you don't, darling.
I've gone through too much to get here.
You tricked me.
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here" Now, we can forget about it.
This is all over.
Ladies and gentlemen, there's been a terrible mista   All right, darling, marry us.
I suppose if I could see it, it would all make more sense.
Dearly beloved, is there anyone in this assemblage that knows any reason why this marriage should not take place?
I do.
And I'm going to make sure that it does not take place.
Fog in the middle of July?
This is peculiar.
Most peculiar.
Forget the weather.
Get on with the ceremony.
O-Oh, yes.
This is a ceremony.
May I have the ring, please?
Huh?
TONY : Oh, the ring?
I don't have any ring.
I'm not even married.
Jeannie!
Now, try to get married without a ring.
You're getting to be a real nuisance.
Let me out!
Help!
Are the bride and groom still here?
Master.
Master you are safe?
I have her trapped in here.
Why don't you get us out of these?
Oh, yes, master.
Right away.
Will you, Jeannie?
What about the guests?
How are we gonna explain this?
Oh, just blink away the fog.
I'll take care of it.
Okay.
Come on.
Wh?
Lucky you found out now, Roger.
Please take me home.
Yeah, sure.
Major, what happened?
Where's the bride?
Oh, she's gone.
Left me at the altar.
How will I ever face my friends?
Yeah, the girl, she lost her nerve and left, sir.
I'm just taking Roger home.
Major, what are you doing with that bottle of champagne?
Oh, I I I thought that Roger might need a little comfort.
I'm just, uh, taking it with him, okay?
Could you do me just one small favor?
Anything you want, Jeannie.
Well, stand about here.
Yeah?
Mm-hm.
And Major Healey?
Me?
Mm-hm.
Would you stand about here?
Please, let me see.
Yes, ah, that is perfect.
And I will stand here.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
What is it?
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Dr. Bellows say what he wanted to see me about?
No, just that it was important.
Dr. Bellows?
He isn't here.
Maybe he left a note.
Hey.
"A Clinical Report on Major Anthony Nelson".
Hey, Roger, it's about me.
Maybe that's what he wanted to see you about.
"A factual dossier on every unexplained incident "in which Major Nelson has been involved for the last three years".
This is dynamite.
Boy, if this thing is submitted, I'm finished.
We gotta get rid of it.
We'll burn it, we'll burn the office.
Jeannie!
You called, master?
Oh, yeah.
You see these papers?
Get rid of them, will ya?
Thanks, sergeant.
At once, master.
No, wait, wait, wait.
Uh, thank you, sergeant.
Oh, uh, Major Healey.
Where's Major Nelson?
Major Nelson.
Oh, he, uh He had to go to the phone.
I want to discuss this report with him.
Now, master?
No, not now.
You can't while Dr. Bellows is there.
Oh, you forget how clever I am.
Shh.
What's going on?
There is a bit of a breeze, I'll, uh I'll close the window.
Major, the window is closed.
Oh, well, then, uh, I'll open it.
What a shame, sir.
The, uh The reports have been blown all over the base.
Don't worry about it.
With Major Nelson involved, I thought something like this might happen, so I took the precaution of making up a few more copies.
Nice work, Jeannie.
Thank you, master.
I just dropped one off with General Peterson.
Carry on, major.
I take it you're aware of the contents of this report, Tony, now, what do you make of it?
I I don't think it's fair to condemn a man before a fair hearing.
No one is condemning anybody, Tony.
It's perfectly understandable, after all the pressure we've been under.
Sir, I respectfully submit that Dr. Bellows is not always I know.
I know how you must feel about him, after working with him all these years.
There's no doubt in my mind.
Bellows is cracked up.
Sir, I'm entitled to a formal hearing Dr. Bellows is cracked up?
Of course.
Whom did you think I meant?
Yeah, you You mean you don't believe this report, sir?
Tony, any man who writes a report like this has got to be a candidate for a padded cell.
Look right here where it says, "Animals, appearing and disappearing".
Bellows swears that on three separate occasions he saw an elephant, a giraffe and a grizzly bear in your living room.
Yeah.
Grizzly bear.
Well, we simply cannot afford to have our astronauts under the care of a man who sees grizzly bears.
No, no, sir.
As of now, Bellows is no longer your doctor.
Yeah.
What?
Oh, master, what happened?
Dr. Bellows is losing his job because of me.
Oh, well, can he not get another job?
The world is getting crazier every minute.
Psychiatrists are in demand.
Jeannie, I got an idea.
Why don't you blink Dr. Bellows up a beautiful office in Beverly Hills with a lot of rich patients.
I'll do it right away.
Yeah, you can throw in the Nobel Prize in medicine.
Nobel Prize in medicine.
Wait a minute, Jeannie.
Just let me handle this.
Hello.
I don't want you to blink anybody anywhere.
Hello?
Oh, uh, yes, Dr. Corbett.
Yes, sir, I'm on my way now.
Who is Dr. Corbett?
He's the new psychiatrist that's taking Dr. Bellows' job.
Dr. Corbett?
Dr. Corbett?
Uh, Dr. Corbett, I'm Major Nelson.
Shh, I haven't finished rewinding yet.
And there we are.
Ha, ha.
Whoo, the old mainspring is just going like new.
Okay, major.
Strip.
I beg your pardon?
I said strip.
Take off your clothes.
Going to give you a physical examination.
Going to give you a complete physical examination.
That'll be today.
Now, tomorrow, we're gonna start with your psychological inventory.
And by this time next week, there isn't one thing about you that I won't know.
Well, uh, you've already seen my medical report Aha.
Gonna resist me, are ya?
Well, no, it's not a question of resistance Well, it won't do you any good because I have my methods.
Come over here.
Over here, major.
You see that?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, hypnotherapy.
That's right.
And if that doesn't work, ahem, sodium pentothal.
Narco-therapy.
By the time I'm through with you, there is nothing that you won't tell me.
No.
Well, how about the old matchstick under the fingernail trick?
What did you say, major?
Ahem.
It's good.
It's good.
Master.
Hey, what happened?
Oh, you look terrible.
I am in perfect physical condition.
Hey, what's Corbett like, anyway?
Oh, he's a monster.
He put me through every physical test known to science.
Well, that doesn't make him a monster.
Yeah, he's gonna pump me full of truth serum and find out all about Jeannie.
He's a monster.
Yeah.
Smite him, Jeannie.
At once.
Now, wait, wait.
Don't Don't smite anybody.
Wait a minute.
At least, don't smite anybody unless we can do it scientifically.
Yeah, yeah, that's it, scientifically, by getting Dr. Bellows his job back.
It's too late, the ax falls in General Peterson's office tomorrow at noon.
All right, that's all we need to know.
Jeannie, Roger, from now on we're gonna be members of the underground.
Underground?
I do not understand, master.
Well, if Dr. Corbett's gonna play Helmut von Gestapo with a truth serum, we're gonna be members of the French Freedom Fighters.
Oh, master, that will be fun.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
Oh, now we will look the part.
Vive la France.
There we are, master.
Now the pipe will leak.
But I still do not understand what we are doing.
Oh, it's simple.
We're gonna prove that Dr. Bellows is perfectly sane.
Oh, by making a heating pipe leak.
How very clever, master.
How does that prove that Dr. Bellows is sane?
Well, in his report, he said that he saw it snow in Cocoa Beach in July.
Well, tomorrow, he's having a meeting in this very room with General Peterson, at noon.
You're gonna make it snow.
Oh.
And then General Peterson will think that he is crazy too.
No, no, not at all.
I'm gonna come up with a perfectly logical explanation.
The heating pipe leaks, causing warm air to escape which rises to the ceiling.
The air conditioner condenses it into snow.
Oh, master, you are brilliant.
No, just desperate.
Clean up this mess and we'll get out of here, all right?
Yes, master.
All right, Jeannie.
Remember, when Dr. Bellows goes in, wait one minute and then let her rip.
Yes, master.
One minute.
All right, let's go.
M-master, I do not have a watch.
I wonder if it matters if it is on Arabian time.
I'm not looking forward to this, Corbett.
Dr. Bellows has been with this program for years.
But it can't be helped.
The man is a dingbat.
Watch yourself, doctor, he's also my friend.
But you read the report, general.
He's a menace and the sooner you get him out of here, the better.
I suppose you're right.
Maybe we'll go to his office.
It'll make it seem less like he's being called on the carpet and fired.
No, general, it would be so much better psychologically if you were to order him to your office We'll go to his office.
General Peterson?
Major.
Sir.
General, uh, weren't you supposed to have your meeting in your office at noon?
We've decided to have it in Dr. Bellows' office instead.
Dr. Bellows?
He's probably waiting in your office, sir.
Oh.
It must have stopped.
It's snowing.
Major Nelson has done it again.
Jeannie.
We are right on schedule, master.
It is snowing inside.
Well, turn it off in there and turn it on in Dr. Bellows' office.
We made a mistake.
Oh, we did?
Yes.
Oh, yes, master.
Right away.
Major Nelson.
Major Nelson.
I know you're around here somewhere.
Dr. Bellows.
Oh, uh, General Peterson.
Quick, it's snowing in your office.
Snowing in my office.
You don't have to believe me.
Just look.
But it was snowing.
I swear it.
Major Nelson is behind this.
He did it once before.
It's in my report.
It's on page a hundred and There, there, doctor.
Now you just relax.
Everything is going to be all right.
General, I assure you, I was sitting in that chair All right, all right.
It suddenly snowed.
I assure you it was snowing.
I was sitting in your office.
Dr. Corbett, I saw it, I felt it Oh, Major Nelson.
Tell 'em, you made it snow.
Tell them.
Um, well, as a matter of fact, it could happen Shh, shh, don't upset him.
Where are you taking him, sir?
I'm going to take him and get him some nice warm snow boots.
Poor Dr. Bellows.
Poor me, I got Corbett to deal with.
Oh, do not worry, master.
I will help you.
Yeah, me too.
We've just got to stay calm.
Yeah, well, Roger, we can stay calm, but just realize that after Corbett's finished with me, he's gonna start on you.
Me?
Oh, me?
!
We got work to do.
Gotta make plans.
How can you be calm at a time like this?
Jeannie, blink him to Australia.
Shall I, master?
No.
I've got a plan, Roger.
I like mine better.
Australia, Jeannie.
Relax, Roger, relax.
You're gonna be his secretary.
Oh, no, master.
I could not work for a man who is your enemy.
You're not gonna work for him, you're gonna work against him.
Oh, well, I like that better.
Oh, I'm sure she'll be fine, major, fine, fine, fine.
As long as she can type and file, take shorthand.
Can you, sergeant?
Shorthand?
Oh, heh, oh, yes.
All right, then thank you for recommending her, major.
My pleasure, sir.
And don't forget we have an appointment at, uh, 4:00 with the, uh, hypno-disk.
Four o'clock, I wouldn't forget that, sir.
Uh, goodbye, sir.
All right, sergeant, take a letter.
I-I can't seem to find my glasses.
They're on your nose, doctor.
Oh, they're on my Oh, good, good.
Heh, heh.
Good luck, Dr. Corbett.
Have you got your steno pad?
Oh, no, but I will get it.
Uh, now then, this letter goes to the director of Medical Services.
Do you not wish to know how I got my notepad and pencil without getting up from my chair?
Sergeant, how you do your job is of no concern to me, only that you do it properly.
Now, this letter goes to the director of Medical Services.
Mmm.
Dear director of Medical Services  You mean, his glasses just popped in on his nose?
When she gets through with him, he'll wish he'd never set foot at NASA.
Ah, therefore in my case, I felt that the standard office furniture would not do.
Yours truly, Farley Corbett.
Uh, sergeant, do you have the time?
My watch seems to have stopped.
Oh, I am sorry, doctor, I do not have a watch.
Well, then, find a clock.
Never mind, there's a clock outside.
Yes?
Sergeant?
Yes, doctor.
Get me Sergeant Krober immediately.
Yes, doctor.
What am I doing here?
I sent for you.
All right, I want you to take this over to the base pharmacy, have it filled and take it over to the resident at the hospital.
Have him give it to Dr. Bellows as directed.
Well, sergeant, what are you waiting for?
I figured as long as I came in without coming through the door, I could leave the same way.
Out.
Uh, yes, general, I got the call.
Uh, yes, sir.
I'll have the report in by Monday morning.
Right.
Oh.
May I call you back, sir?
Thank you.
Yes, yes, few minutes.
Master, I have done everything you said and he has not paid the slightest bit of attention to me.
All right.
We'll have to move on to Phase 2.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
If Corbett is that far out of it, he may be easier to live with than Dr. Bellows, huh?
Roger, if Corbett hypnotizes me or pumps me full of truth serum, he'll find out all about Jeannie.
No, no, it's time to move up to heavy artillery.
Yes, master.
Well, that ought to fix him.
Jeannie, would you please get rid of this.
Oh, but, master, you said you wanted heavy artillery, this is the finest ever made.
No, no.
Now, I want a bear.
A bear?
Up in Dr. Corbett's office.
You mean, a bear, a grizzly bear with grizzly teeth and hair?
I hope you know what you're doing.
So do I. A bear?
A bear.
Well, major, are you ready for our session?
Are you ready to tell me your innermost secrets?
I thought I heard a noise in the closet.
Oh, did you?
I didn't hear anything.
I know your delaying tactics now, major.
No, no, no, it sounded like a bear.
A bear?
Yes.
You can tell me all about it under hypnosis.
Here we go now, major.
Watch the hypno-disk.
You're getting sleepy.
You're getting very sleepy.
Sleepy.
Your lids are very heavy.
Are you sleepy, major?
Sleepy, sleepy.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, yeah.
I'll tell you what, uh  Okay?
Can I get back to you later?
Something's come up.
Y-you probably don't recognize me, but I'm Roger Healey.
Dr. Corbett's next door.
It's a very easy mistake, it's just two doors away.
Ha, ha.
Uh Smoke?
Smoke, Mr. Bear?
Smokey the Bear.
Now you are in a deep, hypnotic trance.
You will answer with complete truthfulness any question that I put to you.
Question to me.
I hear a bear.
Oh, yes, that's the noise you heard before.
You think it's a bear?
Yes, a bear.
A big bear.
A big black bear.
Mm-hm.
Major, when you were a little boy, did you ever go hunting with your father?
Hunting.
Yes, with my dad.
Hunting.
Hunting bear.
Where are you now, major?
I'm in the big piny woods, with Dad.
That feels wonderful.
But I really must go.
Just make yourself at home.
Use the phone.
Make a long-distance call.
Show me the bear.
There's the bear.
Wait a minute, major.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
You're getting sleepy.
You don't see a Very sleepy.
Your eyelids are getting heavy.
Very heavy.
You are getting very sleepy.
Now, wait a minute, major, what's going on?
Just look over there.
Now when I say three, I want you to go to sleep.
Three.
Sleep.
Sleep.
Roger, the bear, the bear.
The bear's in my office.
In your?
How did he get in there?
How'd he get in there?
He just walked in there.
We gotta get him out of there before Peterson sees or we're dead.
You get him out of there.
Have you seen this bear?
This is not a small bear.
The other way.
Other way, this is the way.
Let's see now, where were we?
Oh, yeah, we're in the piny woods hunting a bear.
Very remarkable.
Your illusion is so strong, I almost think I hear him.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What?
What are you doing, major?
I, oh Put me down.
All right, act out your fantasy if you must, major.
Easy does it, now.
I thought you said he was in your office.
Don't you think I know a bear when I see one?
We gotta find him.
You gotta find him.
You find him.
Shh, be quiet.
Don't tell me to be quiet   you're hallucinating Oh!
Oh, dear.
Jeannie.
Oh, master, I'm sorry.
Don't worry about a thing.
I put Dr. Corbett to sleep with his own hypno-disk.
Watch out, watch out.
Yeah, I'm watching out.
Good heavens, a bear.
A bear?
!
Shall I do something?
No, Jeannie, stay away from him.
Sir, maybe you better stay Major, where did that bear come from and what's he doing with Dr. Corbett?
Oh, yeah, Dr. Corbett Yeah, the bear General Peterson, is that you?
Don't pay any attention to this, sir.
It's just Major Nelson acting out his childhood fantasies.
What did he say?
Dr. Corbett thinks the bear is me, sir.
That doesn't explain who the bear thinks he is.
Oh, major, you're heavy.
Um, sir, frankly, I think Dr. Corbett's a little strange.
A little strange?
That's putting it charitably to say the least.
Now, how are we gonna get him away from the bear?
How do we get him away from the bear?
Uh, oh.
This young lady is the bear's keeper.
All right, major, I'll leave it in your hands.
You're reassigned to Dr. Bellows.
And get that bear out of here.
Aah!
Right now.
You've done it again, master.
Yeah, I think I've pretty well done it again.
Good heavens, there's a bear?
Jeannie, will you get rid of it, please?
Oh.
Huh?
Dr. Corbett, what are you doing on the floor?
What's going on here?
The bear, it was sitting on me, and when he got up, I fell on the floor.
The bear.
Mm-hm.
Really?
Yes.
Oh, doctor, why don't you just sit down here on the couch for a moment.
Now, uh, as you were saying.
The bear.
The big black bear.
Mama bear or papa bear?
I don't know, it was a big hairy bear.

It's the house behind us.
Very noisy people.
I've been putting up with them for years.
The house behind you?
Yes.
Major, that horrible noise is coming from right in there.
An ice-cream truck playing rock at 3:00 in the morning?
I can't hear you, sir.
Of course you can't hear me with that infernal racket.

Oh, a chaperon, sir.
You will escort Suzanne to museums, concerts and other cultural events.
It will keep her out of trouble.
Um, sir, I'm kind of tied up in a project And you will see that this person never comes near her.
Who is it, sir?
It's a It calls itself Harold.
It's a dirty, filthy, disreputable hippie.
And if he ever comes near Suzie again, I'll kill him.
Do you get the message?
Yes, sir.
I get the message.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Love.
Isn't it gassy?
That's Harold's latest new poem.
Oh, it is beautiful.
But But do you not think we should get him something to eat?
He does not look well.

I was just a square until I met Harold.
He made me what I am today.
Love.
Jeannie!
Love Oh, here we are, master.
Hi, listen, I Maj, meet your new roommate.

We can double date.
You and Jeannie, and Harold and me.
Yeah.

Not Not Harold.
He's out.
If If your father even sees you with Harold, he's gonna skin you alive.
And me too, for allowing it.
No, I'll never give up Harold!
He's my guru.
You're gonna have to forget your guru Master?

I just came over to tell you that I am leaving town tomorrow for a couple of days.
And, uh, while I'm gone I'm holding you responsible for my daughter's welfare.
Yes, sir.
I understand, sir.
And remember what I said about Harold.
Oh, you don't have to worry about that, sir.
You can count on Aah.
Aah!
What was that?
Oh, I just skinned my knuckles.
Shut the door on my hand.
Silly of me.
Don't you worry about your daughter, sir.
Uh, you can depend on me.
I hope so, major.
I Uh Uh    Jeannie.
That was the most transcendental experience of my life.
Oh, jeez Jeannie did it.
She just blinked and you disappeared.
Nelson.
Oh, great guru, tell us of your wisdom.
Oh, how nice.
Uh, yes, that's it.
Uh, you see, Jeannie is a student of Eastern mysticism, and all she had to do was concentrate and just willed him into the closet.
Oh, master.
I will spend the rest of my life at your feet.
Not here you won't.
You're going out in the back door this time.
You're not throwing Harold out, maj.
Oh, yes, I am.
This is my house.
Remember that.
What would Daddy say if he knew your girlfriend was a guru?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Of course not, maj.
Not as long as you behave yourself.
All together now.
Love!
Love.
Love.
Love.
Master?
What?
How is this?
That's terrible.

What have you done to my car?
Oh, I think it is very artistic, master.
Look at this thing.

Okay, I guess Harold and I will just have to go call my father.
Get in.
Major Nelson.
Oh, my darling master.
Stop.
Eh, Dr. Bellows.
Huh?
Oh.
Major Nelson.

I'm sorry.
I I thought you were someone else.
Peace, baby.
Oh, well, excuse me, uh.
Yes, sir.
Oh, uh, um, Major Nelson, you didn't happen to be in the neighborhood of, uh, Palm and Main Street yesterday afternoon, did you?
Uh, Palm and Main?
Mm.
Um Well, I I saw this car with, uh, "make love, not war" painted on it, and I I could have sworn you were driving.
Palm and Main.
Is that right?
I know it sounds ridiculous, but, uh  Well  Tony!
Tony.
Hey, Tony.
The paint shop can't take your car until Monday.
Thanks, Roge.
What'd he say?
Huh?
Major Healey.
Major!
I have an explanation, sir.
I'm sure you have.
I'm sure it's a good one.
Now, Major Nelson, I've got to find out what this is all about.
Major Healey Get this off me!
"Make love, not war".
What's the meaning of this, major?
Oh, general.
Uh, the, uh, this Is this your idea of a joke, Healey?
Actually, sir, this isn't mine Are you some kind of an overaged hippie?
Sir, actually, I'm one of the youngest I see that I'm going to have to make some changes around here.
That's fine, sir.
I'll be running along.
No, you don't, major.
No, I don't, major.
I have a special little assignment for you.
Yes, sir.
MAN : Roger.
Oh.
Oh, William, you still awake?
I'm drifting off, Roge.
Tell me another joke.
Oh, yeah.
Another joke.
I'm running out of elephant jokes.
Let me see.
What do you get when you cross an elephant with a jar of peanut butter?
I don't know.
What do you get?
Uh, Roge.
Hey.
Heh.
I'm sorry about that thing with Schaeffer and the car.
Oh, that's all right.
Nothing I'd rather do than sit up all night telling Williams dumb elephant jokes.
What do you get when you cross an elephant with a jar of peanut butter?
I'd like to stick around and help you out, but Suzie ordered me back to the house in half an hour.
What do you mean, she ordered you?
She's got me over a barrel.
If I don't do everything she says, she's gonna tell her father about Jeannie.
It could be worse.
You could sit here all night telling dumb elephant jokes.
In fact, do you know any elephant jokes?
I really haven't got time for it.
I'll see you later.
You all right?
Huh?
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What?
Just tell me any joke.
Sorry, Suzie.
It's out of the question.
Oh, but, maj, Harold won't be any trouble.
He hardly eats anything and you've got plenty of room in your pad.
Absolutely not.
Well, it'll just be for a little while.
Until we get married.
Married?
You and Harold are gonna get married?
Have you mentioned this to your father?
Uh-uh.
That's what you're going to do.
Me?
I'm gonna My dear girl, wild horses couldn't get me to mention Harold to your father.
I think that I would rather I dream of Jeannie With the light blond hair  My daughter marry an unwashed hippie?
Are you out of your mind?
!
Yes, sir, I think I think I must be.
He's not such a bad guy, sir.
If you'd just meet him.
You know, just talk to him.
Get out of here before I lose my temper.
Yes, sir.
I wouldn't want you to lose your temper.
Wait.
I have something for you to do.
MAN : You're driving me up the wall.
What happens when you cross an elephant with a jar of peanut butter?
We're trying to remember We're trying to remember, Joe.
Would you tell him the joke?
We've only got another hour here.

I don't know the joke.
I don't even remember telling him any kind of a I'm so tired I can't remember any jokes.
Oh.
Huh?
My poor master.
Is there anything I can do to help?
Yes.
Would you, please?
Would you tell me what happens when you cross an elephant with a A jar of peanut butter.
Oh, that is easy.

That was it, Joe.
Nelson.

Nelson, open the door.
Nelson.
Uh, what?
Oof.
Major Nelson.
Major.

I've been knocking for five minutes.
Uh, heh, uh, well, I was, uh I was just trying to get to sleep, sir.
What are you doing?
I was just stretching, sir.
I was trying to wake up.
I've been asleep.
Would you like a cup of orange juice or a glass of coffee?

I want a full report on your assignment last night.
Oh, my assignment.
What was I doing last night?

No Aaah!
Harold?
How do you do, sir?
I'm very glad to make your acquaintance.
That's Harold?
That's Harold?
That's Harold.
That's Harold.
I do not understand it, master.
After all the trouble we went to to get General Schaeffer to accept Harold, Suzie suddenly decides that she does not like him any longer.
Well, I'll never understand women.
And that goes double for teenagers.
Oh, I feel sorry for Suzie, master.
Mm.
She liked Harold the way he was.
Yeah.
Perhaps I could blink and fix Harold's hair back No, no.
Look, I would need to don't do it.
Jeannie, really, don't do anything.
Uh, I-if you're gonna do anything at all I'd like y-you to fix it so that she forgets she saw you.
Hey, maj.
Open the door.
Huh?
Oh Now Now you You pop out.
Go on, get out.
Oh, master, I like Suzie I know it, but get out.

Uh, I'm sorry, Suzie.
I'm very busy.
Meet Herman, maj.
He's going to be staying with you for the next couple of weeks.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Major Nelson.
You're gonna be surprised by what I'm about to say, but I want you to understand that the need for secrecy is imperative.
Absolutely imperative.
There's a security leak at this base.
A security leak?
You mean, a spy?
Well Well, where?
How?
Have you caught him yet?
No, we have not caught him.
We don't even know who he is.
All we know is that they're after your new modification plan of the Apollo 12 capsule.
Apollo 12?
Mmm.
That's the most closely-guarded secret on this base.
There must be some kind of precautions we can take.
Exactly.
Therefore, General Peterson has decided to remove you from the base until you've finished your design.
An excellent idea, sir.
Where'll I be going?
Well, I don't know.
The location has to be selected by the Computer Section.
It'll even be kept a secret from you.
That's wise.
That's very wise.
And that way, I won't be able to give away the location, even by a slip of the tongue.
I'm glad you're in agreement, major, because you're to leave now.
Now?
That's right.
Oh, uh, come in, men.
Uh, I can go home and, uh, pick up a few things, sir, and throw 'em in a bag and be on my way You, uh, don't seem to understand, major.
Now means now.
Get in.
In there?
Uh, sir, there are arrangements I'd have to make That's all been taken care of.
Now, good luck, major.
But, sir, if If I could just make a phone call There we are.
Now Dr. Bellows, if I could make one phone call Take him away, men.
Easy.
Mm-hm.
You can come out now.
Major Nelson is gone.
Perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
All right, Pomfret, that was your first real peek at Major Nelson, other than films.
What'd you think?
An uncomplicated type.
You were wise in not telling him where he was going.
I doubt if he could keep a secret from anybody.
Oh, by the way, where is this secret destination?
I don't know, and, uh, there's no need for you to know either.
Uh, now then, Pomfret.
From the moment you leave this office, you are Major Anthony Nelson.
Don't worry, sir.
No one could possibly penetrate my cover.
Then stop talking like that.
You've had ample time to study the films of Major Nelson.
Oh, and there's, uh, one thing to remember: To avoid Major Healey as much as possible.
And I'd advise you to spend a lot of time at Major Nelson's house.
Since he lives there alone, there won't be any danger.
Understood.
Shall I assume my duties now?
Right.
Very observant.
Oh, by the way, Dr. Bellows, I wonder if I could use your phone, sir.
Now, Major Nelson, I've told you before about this pho See?
I even had you fooled for a second.
I've noticed that Major Nelson looks very worried around you.
Excuse me, sir.
Moving out the skeleton in somebody's closet?
Some room in there.
Ha, ha, ha.
"Skeleton in somebody's closet".
Hi, Roge.
Hi, Tony.
How are you?
Oh, listen.
Uh, about that top-secret.
Uh, there's been a little change.
Top-secret?
Yeah.
Here's, uh Here's tonight's menu.
I decided on truffled, uh, grouse instead of the tournedos Rossini.
Um, what's the menu for, Roge?
It's the menu for tonight's dinner.
Oh, tonight's dinner, yes.
Sure, at your place, eh?
At my place?
You know I couldn't cook a dinner like that.
I'll see you at 7, huh?
Right you are, Roge.
Seven.
Okay.
"Oysters Rockefeller, truffled grouse, "baked Alaska and Persian melon from Persia".
and baked Alaska.
But you didn't tell me Nelson was a gourmet cook.
Research must have slipped up on that.
Well, it can't be helped.
You'll have to prepare the dinner Major Healey expects.
Can you do it?
Positive.
I once impersonated a chef who was a secret agent for de Gaulle.
Is this really necessary?
Sorry, sir.
Orders.
Even the plane goes on automatic pilot when we reach our destination.
But nobody's gonna know where we are.
There's one thing I know.
We're going fast.
It's all that time in orbit.
Gives 'em an incredible sense of direction.
Yeah.
Stand up, please, major.
Huh?
We're gonna do something about that sense of direction.
Oh.
Baked Alaska  Oh!
My poor master.
Oh, your head.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Who are you?
Oh.
He does not even remember my name.
I am your Jeannie.
What?
!
Oh.
Oh, there, there, there.
My poor master.
Do not worry.
I will make you well again.
Uh, all right.
I'm all right.
I'm I'm fine, miss.
Jeannie.
Do you not even remember my name?
Oh, of course I do.
Yes, of course I do.
Huh.
I'll be fine, Jeannie.
You just, uh, go on and do, uh, what you usually do.
Oh, thank Allah.
Heh.
Well, you see, today is my usual day for housecleaning, but I did not expect you so early.
But I will be finished in a trice.
Oh, right.
Nelson's maid.
In that outfit?
Master?
What are you doing?
Oh, just truffling a grouse.
Uh, Rockefellering some oysters, you know.
I do?
You haven't been around long enough to see me in action.
Master, what is the matter?
Matter?
Ma?
Nothing.
Absolutely nothing's the matter.
Why don't you go finish your housework, hm?
I have finished.
Well, how could you finish?
You just started.
See for yourself.
No.
I I believe you.
I believe you.
Well, I'll see you next time.
Next time?
Yes.
Oh, I am sorry.
I forgot My hands are a little sticky.
I forgot to pay you.
Here, just Just take whatever I owe you, huh?
Pay me?
Oh!
Oh, master!
Now, what on earth is the matter with her?
I tell you, the servant problem these days is something else.
Oh!
Pay me?
Jeannie.
What a time for an earthquake.
Hey, listen, fellas, when you get back to the base, would you do me a favor?
Uh, if you call my house, please, and tell my maid that I won't be home for a while.
Sorry, major.
No communications from you are allowed.
Yeah, but this is important.
One step backward, please.
Oh, all right, but I  Sure is a beautiful place.
I'd love to take a vacation there.
You'll wanna take at least a week.
Tony, I'm here.
Boy, I'm so hungry I could eat a bear.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Oh, what's the?
What's the matter?
I I do not know what is the matter, Major Healey.
It is my master.
He is acting so strangely.
He He He offered to pay me for cleaning the house!
Oh, I don't blame you.
He's been getting free maid service for a long time.
Oh, now, take it easy.
Whoa, that's all right.
Take it easy.
Aw, aw, pumpkin.
Aw.
Aw.
Oh.
That's his girlfriend.
No wonder.
What am I gonna do about this meal?
Hi, Roge, old pal.
Well, you finally put Jeannie on the payroll.
Oh.
Jeannie, I'm sorry about, uh, this afternoon.
I was tired and hot.
I'd had a hard day at the office, you know.
Hey.
All fixed up.
I am sorry too, master.
It was a misunderstanding.
Now that we're all friends again, how 'bout making Tony's favorite drink?
A Baghdad Camel.
Yes, a Baghdad Camel would certainly hit the spot right about now.
Right away, master.
Uh, I'm sorry about dinner, but I'm afraid Here we are, master.
Fantastic.
Mmm.
To a pleasant evening.
You, uh, had 'em all ready, huh?
Boy.
Mmm.
Delicious.
As always.
Look, kids, about dinner.
I'm afraid the earthquake destroyed everything.
Do you mind going out for dinner tonight?
Well Well Well, what earthquake?
The earthquake that demolished the kitchen about two hours ago.
I didn't feel any earthquake.
Well, it demolished the kitchen and everything in it.
As a matter of fact Oh, master.
This room looks all right.
Ah Master, I am sorry.
Heh.
That was no earthquake.
That was me.
You?
Mm-hm.
Yes.
I was just a little bit angry with you, so   Yeah.
Do not worry, master.
I-I will fix everything.
No, you don't Don't go in there, it's   Hey, that looks great.
Let's eat.
Hey, how did you?
How did you do that?
They were all over the kitchen.
Something wrong, master?
No.
Good evening, Major Nelson.
Dr. Bellows.
I thought the television was for relaxation.
You're not there to relax, major.
We've arranged to cut in for communications with Cocoa Beach.
Twice a day at 12 noon and again at 12 midnight, your time.
Right, sir.
Two times a day.
Correct.
And remember, this project is important.
Uh, how's the work going?
Oh, just fine, sir.
Just fine.
Uh, but I do have a few questions.
I wanna show you a tape, major.
It was made several weeks ago.
I think it will explain everything.
I don't remember making any tape, sir.
Major Nelson, meet Major Nelson.
Hi, Tony.
I know we haven't met, but I feel I know you well enough to call you Tony.
It's Eh, that's me.
No, no, it couldn't be me.
Yes, it is me.
Relax, major.
That man is an intelligence agent with theatrical training.
He's a dead ringer for you, and no one will notice a discrepancy.
Not even if he's having dinner with Major Healey at your house.
That's That's really remarkable, sir.
It would fool prac It won't work.
It won't work, Dr. Bellows.
Well, of course it will.
It's working now.
Major Healey has already accepted him as you.
What's the matter, major?
Nothing, sir.
It's not Major Healey I'm worried about.
Well, Jeannie.
Where's old Roge?
Oh, he went home.
Home?
Mm-hm.
Healey!
Healey, you forgot Jeannie!
Roger?
He's gone.
And you're still here.
Of course I am still here.
Master, are you sure you feel all right?
I'm fine.
Fine, fine.
Uh, listen, Jeannie, ahem, it was great of good old Roge to allow you to help with my housecleaning.
But what does Major Healey But there's no reason for you to stay and do the, uh, dishes.
I can do them myself.
They are done.
Mm.
Yes.
That's fine.
Good Good little worker, aren't you?
Uh, he probably forgot.
Shall we go?
Go where, master?
Home?
Master?
We are home.
All right, she's not the maid, and she's not Healey's girlfriend.
Jeannie, uh Ahem.
I've been thinking, uh How long has it been since we first, uh, met?
Oh, well, it has been a long time, master.
I have been so happy that the time has just flown by.
Well, you know how your memory plays tricks on you.
I I can't for the life of me remember, uh, when we first got together.
Do you mean our anniversary?
Yes, our anniversary.
The anniversary of our marriage.
Marriage?
Oh, master.
Oh, master, that is why you have been acting so strangely.
After all these years, you are finally going to ask me to marry you.
Oh!
I am ready!
Oh!
You darling thing.
Everyone will be so happy.
No, no, no.
Wait till I tell my mother.
No, no.
You've got the wrong idea.
She won't believe it.
She will not believe it.
Oh, master, darling, goodbye.
I'm going to go tell everyone.
You've made me the happiest genie in the world.
That That's not the idea at all.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Nelson's gonna kill me.
Let's see.
I wonder if I can get Jeannie here.
At least I'll know what's going on.
What am I talking about?
I don't even know what hemisphere I'm in.
Fresh air.
Sure does give you an appetite.
Let's see what I have for lunch.
Veal cutlet.
My favorite.
Mm-mm.
Ridiculous.
I was simply intoxicated.
She won't even be here this morning.
Oh!
Oh, master.
It does not matter if you see the bride before the wedding.
I want you to meet the Right Reverend Ibn Bernouli.
Uh, do I have to?
He says that he is honored to meet you, master, and honored to perform the marriage ceremony according to the ancient rites.
How do you do?
He says that he is all choked up, master, because he performed this very same ceremony for my mama and papa over 5000 years ago.
Five thousand years ago.
As a matter of fact, I believe he was at their wedding anniversary just last year.
Well, when you marry people, they really stay married, don't they?
Master, wait!
Wait!
Oh  He has just gone to, uh Uh To get a marriage license.
That is it.
In America, one needs a license for everything.
America.
Come in.
Well, major.
Everything go all right?
Negative, Dr. Bellows.
I'm drunk.
Yes.
That's the only explanation, sir.
She fed me a Baghdad Camel last night, and it must have been pure alcohol, because from the first sip, I was smashed.
I began to see things.
I still think I'm smashed.
Don't be ridiculous, major.
Look at you.
You're neatly dressed.
Your eyes aren't bloodshot.
You didn't stagger, your speech isn't slurred.
Nevertheless, wait till I tell you what I saw.
Oh, I can hardly wait.
Major Healey, are you in the habit of barging into a superior officer's office?
I'm sorry, sir.
Looking for Major Nelson.
I gotta talk to you right away.
Later, Roge.
When I sober up.
When you sober up?
Ah, Major Nelson is intoxicated.
That's impose Impossible, sir.
He doesn't drink.
Oh, yeah?
Um What was in that Baghdad Camel last night?
Pablum?
I never saw anything like it, sir.
Uh, plates appearing and then disappearing, a-a turkey that carves itself, a-a baked Alaska just suddenly appearing out of nowhere.
He's drunk, that's right.
Stoned.
Very stoned.
Look at that.
Bloodshot eyes there, tie all crooked and wobbly.
Now, is that the Tony Nelson we know, sir?
All right.
I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Come along, major.
We're going to the lab and take a blood sample.
We'll soon find out what's wrong with you.
Major Healey.
TONY : Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows?
Dr. Bellows, I've gotta talk to you.
Tony?
Tony, what are you doing on television?
Roger, thank goodness it's you.
We're in terrible trouble.
I'll say we are.
What's the idea of telling Dr. Bellows about Jeannie?
What are you talking about?
Just now, when you walked out of the office.
How could you walk out of the office and be on TV?
It wasn't me, Roge.
It wasn't you.
Of course it wasn't you.
I mean, you wouldn't act like that.
It wasn't you?
Look, there's a phony Tony on the loose.
Now listen.
I don't know how much time we've got.
Yeah.
I think I better.
Bellows Tony?
Tony, come back.
Come back.
Ah.
He's somewhere in France.
A-as soon as the sands run out, you must go?
Oh, b-but what if my master does not return?
All right, Reverend.
As soon as the sands run out.
You see, major, not a trace of alcohol in your blood.
You're stone-cold sober.
Well, sir Sir, in that case, there's only one other explanation.
I'm really seeing those things.
Well, Major Nelson.
For the first time since I've known you, you admit it.
I admit nothing.
Oh.
I'm sorry, I almost forgot.
I thought for a moment you were the real Major Nelson.
Well, nevertheless, come on.
This time, I think we've got him.
We're going to the house and see what's really going on.
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
I'll I'll I'll I'll take him, sir.
A cold shower and hot coffee will fix him up Uh, no, there's no need, major.
Major Nelson and I are going to his house and see what's going on.
Major Healey, if you don't mind.
Oh.
Pomfret, I want you to know that I was against substituting you for Major Nelson from the start.
But if you really can show me any proof of any funny business going on at Proof positive, sir.
She wears a funny little outfit like she came out of an Arabian harem.
No.
Extraordinary.
Yes.
She blinks her eyes, and things pop in and out.
Vacuum cleaners, baked Alaskans, chickens.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Tony?
Tony?
Tony, I just met your identical twin.
He's not a twin, Roger.
He's an intelligence agent made up to look like me.
Well, he's sure doing a good job.
He's even got Dr. Bellows fooled.
Roger, Dr. Bellows is the one who assigned him.
They think there's a security leak at NASA and they wanted me to finish my work on the capsule modification in secure surroundings.
Well, why the double?
Why didn't they just send you away?
Because they don't know who the security leak is and they don't want whoever it is to know that I'm gone.
So for the past six weeks they've had this guy learning everything about me there is to know.
Whew.
Boy, that's a relief.
And I was worried they'd find out about Jeannie.
Roger, he doesn't know about Jeannie.
Yeah, well, he will in about five minutes.
He's on his way to your house, to Jeannie.
Well, what are you standing around for?
Stop him.
Good idea.
Tell me where you are.
Jeannie will rescue you.
Well, I don't know where I am.
Nobody knows where I am.
Yeah, yeah, right.
I'll go and ask Dr. Bellows.
Roger, I told you, nobody knows.
How can you ask when you're not supposed to know I'm gone?
Wait a minute.
Dr. Bellows know that I don't know?
Oh, if Dr. Bellows doesn't know that I don't know then it doesn't matter if I ask him.
While you're standing there, talking nonsense Dr. Bellows is on his way to my place, he's gonna find Jeannie.
Now, please stop him.
Yeah, stop him.
Right, right, yeah.
Oh, I forgot, congratulations.
Your double proposed to Jeannie.
You're getting married.
Pomford, I want you to know that I was against substituting you for Major Nelson from the start.
But if you really can show me any proof of any funny business going on at Nelson's Proof positive, sir.
She wears a funny little outfit like she came out of an Arabian harem.
An Arabian harem?
Yes.
She blinks her eyes and things pop in and out.
Vacuum cleaners, baked Alaskans, chickens.
I'll prove it to you, sir, or my name isn't Rodney Pomford.
Just a moment, sir.
I just had a thought.
If Nelson has been keeping this girl secret all this time perhaps she won't perform for you.
Very shrewd, major.
Very shrewd.
That's been my problem.
When I've tried to show General Peterson the strange things I've seen, nothing happens.
Mm.
You wait here.
I'll go inside and tell her that I've let you in on the secret and she can do her thing.
I can hardly wait, major.
I'm finally going to catch Major Nelson.
Right there, sir.
This shouldn't take too long.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Oh, I was over there, and I'm here  Right.
What's he saying?
He says you must kneel, master.
It is the custom.
Oh, well, I wonder if you would mind if we'd be alone Jeannie and I could be alone?
What's he saying?
He is marrying us, master.
Oh, I am so excited.
M-marrying us?
Well, he can't.
Oh.
Oh!
You did get the marriage license, did you not?
M-marriage license?
Well, yeah, that's right.
You can't You can't marry us, sir.
In this country it takes three days for a marriage license to come through and I just registered today.
So if you could arrange to come back next week.
What's happening?
What's he saying?
He is going, master.
Wait.
Wait.
I have somebody I want you to meet.
Ah, nuts!
Oh, it is all right, master.
I have waited all these years.
I can wait three more days.
Jeannie, in honor of our marriage, I've decided to tell Dr. Bellows everything.
Oh, master, that is wonderful.
Oh, now I know it is really going to happen.
Yeah.
You stay right here, and I'll bring him in to meet you and you can do all your tricks for him.
I would be most happy to, master.
Good.
I have always liked Dr. Bellows.
Yeah.
Good.
Oh, and you can put on your harem outfit.
You know, the one you usually wear.
Oh, instantly, master.
Oh.
Psst.
Psst.
Jeannie.
Oh, Major Healey, the most wonderful thing.
In three days, my master and I are getting married.
He has announced our engagement to Dr. Bellows, and I am so happy.
That's not Tony.
Oh, you are right, Major Healey.
He has certainly changed.
No.
I mean that's not Tony.
It's an imposter, a fake, a phony.
Oh, that is impossible, Major Healey.
He looks like himself.
No, no, that's just makeup.
It's a trick.
He's trying to expose you.
I do not believe you.
Jeannie?
Hm.
I shall soon find out if he is my master or not.
No, no, no, you can't do that.
He's with Dr. Bellows.
Major Healey, let me go.
No, you're gonna spoil the whole thing.
I can't let you go.
I guess I can.
Jeannie, I want you to meet Dr. Bellows.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Major Healey.
What are you doing here?
Uh, we're having lunch.
Tony and I always have lunch on Tuesdays.
Right?
Lunch on Tuesdays?
Oh yes, Roger, it just slipped my mind.
Uh, where's Jeannie?
That's what I was wondering.
Major Healey, what's the matter?
Oh, what's the matter?
Well, I keep my Wanna keep my coffee warm.
I will give you one chance to prove he is not my master.
I've told Dr. Bellows all about Jeannie.
Oh, well, that's That's nice.
That's very nice.
Nice girl.
Nice.
Very good find.
Uh, where did you find Jeannie?
You never told me.
Oh, I told you that story a hundred times, Roge.
No, you haven't, not once.
Yes, I have.
You haven't.
Yes, I have.
Well, I was walking in a park one day and I heard a noise, and I look over and there was Jeannie sitting on a bench.
Major Healey, what's the?
Why are you shaking?
Oh, it's hot.
Cold.
Hot.
Cold, warm, hot.
See, Jeannie, he's an imposter.
Ugh.
You are right.
He is not my master.
Oh, how shall I punish him?
Shall I give him the death of a thousand itches?
Scratches.
Itches are much worse.
Yeah.
Or shall I cause him to be hung by his toenails, and lowered inch by inch into a basket of cobras?
Oh!
You can't do any of those.
We've got to keep Dr. Bellows and what's-his-name from finding out about you until Tony's back.
Well, how can we get him back, if we do not know where he is?
Yeah, that's a problem.
Jeannie, come on out.
Dr. Bellows wants to meet you.
She doesn't like anyone in the kitchen, sir.
Out of my way, Major Healey.
I've waited a long time to meet this Jeannie.
Did you wipe your feet before you came in?
I don't want anybody tracking mud all over my clean floor.
That's Jeannie?
Jeannie, would you cut it out?
Dr. Bellows knows all about you.
Well, that don't mean he can come in here and barge in and put mud all over my clean carpets.
And that goes for you too.
Uh, Major Nelson, um, I'd like to have a few words with you.
Jeannie, who am I?
Are you kidding?
You're Major Anthony Nelson.
You pay me two lousy bucks an hour to cook and keep house for you, not to stand here and answer dumb questions.
I've seen enough.
Would you get a grip on yourself?
Ah.
An itch, an itch.
Scratch, scratch.
What are you trying to do, blow the whole thing?
Oh, I'm sorry, Major Healey.
I lost my temper.
What's made you itch?
I don't know.
I don't know.
Are you all right?
Yes, sir, I'm fine now.
I don't know how that happened.
You see?
You see?
You see?
She blinked, and it She gave me an itch.
Major, I think you'd better come along with me.
Oh, uh, Dr. Bellows, there's one thing I've been meaning to tell you.
Uh, Tony's been acting kind of strange lately.
It's probably the new project's strain on him.
I think we should have him go in the hospital for a couple days.
Major, perhaps you're right.
I think a few days of rest is indicated.
Uh, you're confined to this house until further notice.
Here?
Here in this house?
Oh, no, the hospital would be better.
That won't be necessary.
I think a few days of looking reality in the face is all the rest Major Nelson needs.
Bye.
Wait, Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows, you're making a big mistake, sir, I tell  You see, she did it again.
She tripped.
I-I-I She blinked, and I tripped.
That's what happened.
Will you come to your senses before Major Healey and that That housekeeper realize that you're not the real Major Nelson?
Goodbye.
Wait, wait, wait.
Major Healey, what are we going to do with this?
This stranger.
Could you put him out of action a couple of minutes, so we can talk?
Certainly.
It will be a pleasure.
Oh, that's good.
Good.
Now, Major Healey, what have you done with my master?
I'll tell you as soon as you finish your housework.
Will you get out of that outfit?
Oh, certainly.
If they have taken my master and you are keeping it from me I'm keeping it from you?
I don't even know where he is.
Dr. Bellows and Tony doesn't know where he is.
Boy, you've got to do something, or that phony's gonna convince Dr. Bellows that he's not seeing things.
MAN : Calling Agent X-12.
Calling Agent X-12.
Come in X-12.
X-12, do you read me?
Calling Agent X-12.
This is Agent X-12.
Agent X-12 reporting.
The situation at Nelson's house is confusing.
But I have not blown my cover.
Dr. Bellows has no idea that I'm a double agent.
I am still trying to find the whereabouts of Major Nelson.
I've got to be careful to stay out of her way.
Looking for something?
No.
No.
I I'm just taking a little exercises.
Getting the kinks out.
I'm kind of stiff from being in bed.
Yes, you look a little stiff.
I I can't move.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Poor Major Nelson.
All right, would you help me to the bedroom, please?
Oh, I am not paid to be a nurse, master.
Well, then in that case I'll have to call Dr. Bellows.
Oh, well, that's better.
Look, Jeannie, I've been thinking.
You haven't had a vacation in quite a long time.
Why don't you take all of next week off, huh?
With pay.
Oh, I could not do that, master.
You are not strong enough to do without me.
Oh, no.
No, I'm fine, thank you.
Besides a little weakness in the knees.
See what I mean?
Could you help me into the bedroom, please?
Oh, no, I'm going to stay right here.
No, you're not gonna go?
No.
No?
Well, in that case, I have to go to the bedroom myself.
No.
No.
Not in there.
I have not finished cleaning in there.
I gotta lie down.
You can lie down upstairs.
No, I don't wanna lie down I will make you comfortable.
Please, I don't Ah!
Whew.
Well now I can search for my master in peace.
Oh!
Huh?
Oh.
It's not happening.
It's not happening.
It's all a bad dream.
It's all a bad dream.
There you go, major, as good as new.
Sorry about this, but that place is still operational.
It's all right.
Orders are orders.
The important thing is I finished the project.
Don't forget to check in immediately with Dr. Bellows, sir.
Right.
Right.
Major Nelson?
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows, I was just on my way to see you.
Major, what are you doing here?
You're under orders to stay home.
Oh, I'm not that Major Nelson.
I know that.
No, I mean, I am Major Nelson.
Well, of course you are.
And I'm very happy to see that you're looking better.
Get back to Major Nelson's house immediately.
But sir, I finished the program, and I gotta get Are you trying to jeopardize this entire project?
No, sir.
Then go home.
That's an order.
Hi.
Nice talking to you.
Hey.
I'm sorry.
Must have slipped.
Well, I guess it's no use trying to get out.
Shh.
Good morning, NASA.
Let me speak to Dr. Bellows, please.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Well, enough is enough.
Jeannie?
Oh.
I wish my master would come back.
I do not think I can control myself much longer with this This imposter.
Oh.
Dr. Bellows, you've got to get me out of here.
I can't take it anymore.
What are you talking about?
You were here at NASA a half-hour ago and against my orders.
I haven't been outta here in a week.
You gotta get me outta here.
I think I'm going crackers.
Stay put.
I'll be right there.
Secret project all here.
It's all here.
That's it?
Jeannie, will you please open the door?
It's Nelson.
The idiot is back.
Come on, Jeannie, let me out, huh?
Ooh!
Jeannie!
Will you let me out?
Will you stop that yelling?
You are giving me a headache.
Jeannie, is that you?
Well, of course it is me.
Who do you think it is, Tiny Tim?
What's the matter with you?
This is Tony.
Would you please open the door?
I can't stand it when he says my master's name.
Jeannie.
What is it?
Don't you touch me.
I'm sorry.
Ah!
What is this all about?
I'm your master.
What's the matter with you?
I cannot stand it when you How dare you try to impersonate my beautiful, wonderful master?
I am your beautiful, wonderful master.
Bye-bye, loony bin.
Jeannie, please.
I got an order.
I got an order.
Stop this itching.
Only my master can give me orders.
I am your master, and I can prove it if you'd just stop the itching.
All right.
All right.
I will give you one chance.
Where did you find me?
I found you Where did I find you?
On a island.
On an island in the middle of the Pacific in a bottle, and I'm sorry I ever saw that island.
Oh, master, it is you.
It is you!
I'm so happy!
Will you stop hugging me and stop the itching?
Oh, yes, master.
Immediately.
Immediately.
Right now.
Now do it!
I cannot believe it is you.
Thank you.
Jeannie where's my double?
Well, I do not know.
I thought he was here.
Well, I gotta go and tell him the masquerade is over.
You will not like him.
Huh?
He's trying to steal the attachÃ© case.
What shall I do, master?
Shall I smite him?
You bet your life you're gonna smite him.
I just gotta figure out how.
Oh.
Well, major, I'd like to know what you were doing at NASA an hour ago when you had explicit orders to remain here.
Yeah, Tony.
Let me Let me hear you explain that.
Well, I just got back, sir.
I finished the project.
See?
You're the real Tony?
Yeah.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
Oh, boy.
You're the real Major Nelson?
Wait a minute, buddy.
Good afternoon, Dr. Bellows.
Roger.
I'm the real Major Nelson.
And that man is a spy.
A spy?
You know, Major Healey, I I can't tell which is which.
Oh, no doubt about it, sir.
We've been buddies a long time.
This is him.
It's him, all right.
Roger.
Are you certain?
Am I certain?
I knew this man was an imposter from the first time I saw him.
Right?
No.
All right, grab him.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
All right, get him up now.
Hey, Tony, I didn't know you had false teeth.
Oh, Roger, I don't wear false teeth.
I don't wear false teeth.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Let's see "One carton tohmemie".
"Two pounds kipbi".
Hmmm.
"One quart yachni".
Ooh.
Low-fat.
One Oh, hello, Major Healey.
Hi, Jeannie.
What are you doing here?
I am doing the grocery shopping.
Aren't you afraid somebody'll see you?
Oh, no.
I promised my master that no one would notice me.
I am being very careful.
See?
Why not give it the old one, two, three, and blink up a whole cupboard full of groceries?
I could not do that.
I would miss out on all the specials.
Low-fat yachni.
Mm-hm.
And it is only 79 cents.
That's a break.
Seventy-nine cents.
Oh.
Excuse me, you're blocking traffic.
Oh, I am terribly sorry.
This is a supermarket, not a dating bureau.
Nice talking to you.
I do not know why people have to be so unpleasant.
I guess not everybody has a genie to do their shopping.
Let's get outta here.
Follow me.
Shh, right here.
Nine hundred and ninety-eight.
Nine hundred thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine.
One million.
She's the one.
Congratulations, miss.
You are the one millionth person to shop in Food City.
And you won't believe what's gonna happen to you.
No.
Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the queen of the supermarket.
I do not understand.
Ah, well, she's a little flustered, and no wonder.
It's very simple, miss.
You are the one millionth person to shop in Food City.
And we're gonna honor you with some marvelous prizes.
Oh, well, thank you very much, but I do not think Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Don't be selfish.
Think about Tony.
Oh, I am thinking of him, and I do not think he Well, don't think of Tony.
Think of me.
What, eh?
What?
What kind of prizes?
Well, first of all, a month's free groceries.
A month's supply of free groceries.
Good, good, good.
What?
What else?
An entire wardrobe by Jeannette Dupree of Cocoa Beach.
Oh, Major Healey, I make all my own clothes.
You're being selfish again.
I'll take it.
Major Healey, you would look silly in a wardrobe by Jeannette Dupree.
Are you kidding?
It's free, I'll wear it.
She'll accept.
Fine, fine, fine, fine.
Now, Miss, eh What's your name?
Major Healey, I Major Healey.
J-Jeannie.
Jeannie's her name.
Major Jeannie.
Uh, n-no, just Jeannie.
I do not have a last name.
Ah, la La Her last name is Nelson.
Nelson.
uh, Cocoa Beach.
Miss or Mrs.?
Alas, I am not a Mrs. Good, because for single persons, we have a special bonus prize.
Really?
Don't tell me.
Uh, two weeks in Hawaii?
Oh, no, no.
A convertible?
Her own tropic island?
Major Healey, I cannot go any further with this until I have spoken to my master.
I shall return.
Nothing quite as elaborate as that, major.
It's What happened to the queen?
Uh, what queen?
The queen of the supermarket.
Oh, that queen.
Well, she's over near the yachni section.
Seventy-five cent sp-special.
I'll get her.
Major Nelson, I don't understand your reluctance.
The Cocoa Beach Rodeo is gonna be quite a gala affair.
Oh, sir, I I rode a lot when I was a kid, but I haven't been on a horse in five years.
Well, you won't be required to perform.
All you have to do as honorary grand marshal is to ride in, and then preside over the contests.
Dr. Bellows, I'm no good at publicity.
You know that.
All those personal appearances All right, major, all right.
All the other astronauts are gonna be occupied, so I suppose I'll have to do it myself.
There.
That's very colorful, sir.
Well, I used to do a bit of riding myself in my younger days.
Pecos Alfred, they called me.
You'll be wonderful.
Yeah.
I'm sorry you won't join us, Nelson.
I'll be seeing you, pardner.
Pardner.
Good morning, master.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
I've told you Dr. Bellows What if you had popped in then?
I'm sorry, master, but I had to talk to you.
I have been made queen of the supermarkets.
You've been made what?
!
Well, you see, I I was the millionth customer in Food City, a-and so they made me queen.
I did not wish to accept, and there are a lot of prizes, but Major Healey said that I would be very selfish Wait.
Was Roger there with you?
Never mind.
Don't go any further.
He heard "prizes" and he He went crazy, right?
That's right, master.
You can't do it.
That's impossible.
You know about you and publicity.
They'll ask questions, all that stuff.
You do not have to shout at me, master.
I did not want to accept.
Oh, well, all All right.
Is?
Is Roger still there?
Yes, master.
All right, now, y-you go home and don't show your face around that food market again, you understand?
Thank you.
Let's see how Roger's gonna get his prizes without a queen.
Ha, ha, ha.
Lunch is ready, master.
Guess what I've made.
Well, if it's sautÃ©ed khaldoons, I'm tired of them.
Oh, no, master.
It is paella.
Look.
Oh.
Hey, horses.
Oh!
Horses on our street?
Yeah, how about Oh, it must have something to do with the rodeo Dr. Bellows tried to rope me into.
You sure this is the house?
Yeah, it says 1020 Palm Drive.
Well, the little filly must be in there.
Whoo!
Come on.
You'd better get back to your bottle.
Yeah, go on.
Tsk.
Oh!
Howdy, pardner.
Hi, hi.
Ow.
Hi.
A-are you guys looking for me?
Well, not unless you changed a whole lot in the last hour.
Well, if it's about the rodeo, I've already told Dr. Bellows that I can't be the grand marshal.
Now, whoa there, sonny.
You're a mite confused.
We don't want you.
We're looking for a pretty little filly by the name of, uh, Jeannie.
That's right.
Jeannie?
Yeah, the one that was over at the Food City a couple hours ago.
Uh, she won the grand prize.
Which means she's gonna be queen of the Cocoa Beach Rodeo.
Quite a pair of lungs you got there, Tex.
Well, I'm afraid you made a mistake.
Oh, hold on, sonny, there's no mistake.
She gave her address as 1020 Palm Drive.
Well, there's nobody by that name living here.
I'll go get her.
Oh, hi, hi, guys.
Hi.
Great, isn't it?
Yeah, I wanna talk to you.
Not now.
I've gotta get the queen.
Yeah, right now.
Don't go away, guys.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I just had this thing pressed.
Have you gone stark staring berserk?
Ah, I know what you're upset about: It's the prizes, right?
I'll give you the food.
I'll take the convertible and trip to Hawaii No, no.
Jeannie's not queen of anything.
Too late.
She's already queen.
If that woman hadn't crowded  Hey, major.
Uh, wait a minute.
I had this pressed.
Wait a minute, will you?
I just had this suit pressed.
Don't you understand?
Officially, Jeannie doesn't exist.
No birth certificate, passport, driver's license.
A driver's license?
You don't need a driver's license to ride a horse.
Or a passport.
She's a genie!
You called, master?
No, no, I I did.
No, no.
Back to your bottle.
But I heard It was a mistake.
Back in your bottle.
On better thought, go to see your mother in Baghdad.
Major Healey.
Aha, there's our lucky little queen.
What happened to you in the market?
We looked everywhere.
Well, I-I thought I should She got very excited and just wanted to tell someone about it.
I can certainly understand that.
She's got a great experience ahead of her.
Now step outside.
There's some people who'd like to meet you.
Oh, thank you.
I do not think I should.
Yeah, she'd love to.
But I I didn't say any Now you have to go through with it.
He's already seen you.
Miss, I'd like you to meet Mr. Charles Akins, the owner of the Wild West Rodeo.
How do you do, sir?
Hey, what about me?
Ain't somebody gonna introduce me to the little filly?
Rein in, Billy boy, rein in.
Miss, this is Wild Bill Barrows, our best bronco buster.
BARROWS : Yes, ma'am.
And I'm the roughest, toughest, rootinest, tootinest, ring-tailed buckaroo that ever roped a calf.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
Don't worry none, major.
Billy Boy won' hurt her.
Besides, if he comes out top cowboy in this rodeo like he figures to, heh-heh, why, he'll even win a date with this pretty little filly as part of the prize.
Whoo-hoo!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, old pardner.
Take it easy there.
Heh-heh-heh!
Hey, fella, cool it.
Easy there, son.
Don't you know better than to go fussing around a man working with a loop?
You You hurt my master!
Billy boy, what in tarnation happened?
Here.
Dad-blamest thing I ever saw.
That little lady roped me in nothing flat.
You know, she's a natural-born cowgirl.
Oh, little lady, when I win this here contest, you and me are gonna go out and have ourselves a time!
Yee-haw!
Hey, watch it!
Watch it!
Believe me, I don't like the idea any more than you, but you've got to go through with it.
Why could I not just disappear until the rodeo is over?
Because I can go visit my mother.
No, no.
Everybody's seen you here.
They'd ask questions.
They know you live here.
So you are just going to abandon me?
Wh-what's so terrible about it?
All you have to do is be the queen of the rodeo, that's all.
Yeah, and go out with Genghis Khan.
Oh, come on, you're exaggerating.
Wild Bill Barrows is not Genghis Khan.
Oh, yes, he is too, master.
They are exactly alike.
You forget.
I knew Genghis Khan.
You don't even have an indication that he's gonna win.
He will win.
Genghis Khan always wins.
Oh I know.
I will fix it so that he cannot win.
I will make him fall No, no, no.
No tricks.
No.
Jeannie, Jeannie, no tricks.
That's exactly why I'm having you do this.
So nobody'll get suspicious.
Oh, but, master, have pity No, I'm sorry.
You're gonna have to do it my way.
That's an order.
Very well, master.
I will do it your way.
But you will not like it.
Now, wait a minute.
Don't Don't go No, no, no.
I don't want you to go J-Jeannie, come back here.
Jeannie!
Howdy, pardners.
Stop.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Oh, now I know why they call these "chaps".
Now remember what we're supposed to do.
What're we supposed to do?
We get next to Jeannie in the box, right?
Yeah.
If she looks like she's gonna zap Brewster, we stop her.
Dig?
Why don't we just sit next to her in our uniforms?
Because she would connect me with Dr. Bellows.
Yeah, of course.
The thing to do is just look like all the other cowboys around here.
You know, relax, take it easy, just easy.
Walk bowlegged, right?
Here we go.
Just a minute, gents.
Sign here.
Uh, what am I signing here?
It's nothing.
You gotta sign before you get in.
Oh, good.
Here, sign that.
I'm not signing.
Just sign it.
Yeah, I'm signing it.
Okay.

They haven't made up their mind yet.
Oh, they think we're entering.
We're not.
We'll get out of it.
It's just, uh, bulldogging, calf roping, that kind of stuff.
I was almost trampled by my rocking horse when I was 3.
I'm not signing anything.
I'll be with you in a minute, soon as I finish signing them up.
Okay, I'll see you later.
You sure get some strange ones.
Well, boys, what's it gonna be?
Huh?
Is it gonna be rearing a steer or rearing a horse?
Oh, now.
What about a wild chicken?
Oh, no, I didn't come to enter.
He's, uh My old buddy here is a clown.
A rodeo clown.

My master?
Where?
The Pinto Kid, the one that's about to be killed to keep you from going out with Wild Bill Barrows.
Oh, master.
Oh.
Oh, master.
Fantastic.
It's just incredible.
The Pinto Kid has stayed on that horse for five full minutes.
Oh, that should do it.
A minute would have done it.
I know, but I could not help teaching my master a lesson.
Boy, let me tell you.
Here, boy.
Congratulations.
That's the greatest performance I ever did see.
Major Nelson.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
And I thought you didn't know anything about horses.
I don't.
But I sure know a lot about women.
Over this way, boy.
This way, boy.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, darling master, where shall we go to dinner?
Dinner?
Oh, you look beautiful, master.
Oh, thank you.
I suppose you will be going to the Surf for dinner.
Mm-hm.
And then perhaps dancing and a-a drive along the beach?
That's right.
It is a beautiful night for it.
Yeah, yeah.
Full moon.
H-have a wonderful time.
I will.
And do not worry about getting home early.
I won't.
I will be fine.
Good.
Good night, Jeannie.
Good night.
Master.
Aren't you dressed yet?
They're not gonna hold a table.
It's very busy.
But I thought Je You know I hate to have a date keep me waiting.
Now, will you hurry up?
Oh, master.
Oh, I am so happy.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Ah!
Jeannie.
There, master.
Now the tree is all trimmed, and we can go to our island for the Sunday Jeannie, not here.
Don't blink in here.
The tree hasn't been trimmed, it's been blinked.
Now put that thing back.
Oh, but master, ever since I found that island where they sent you I've wanted to go there with you, and you promised me that this Sunday we could go.
Yeah, I know, but the island's gonna have to Hi, Miss Gordan.
The island's just gonna have to wait.
I've After I finish the tree, I gotta mow the lawn and paint the kitchen windows.
It's just gonna take all day, that's all.
Not if you let me help you.
No help, thanks.
No help.
No, put it back.
Oh, but master, last Sunday you weeded the entire back lawn, the Sunday before, you cleaned the garage Yes, I know.
And you would not let me help with any of it.
Jeannie, I like to putter around the house.
It relaxes me.
Now come on.
Put it back, will you?
Yes, master.
And all he does when he gets home from NASA is work around the house.
He has not had time for me in over a month.
Mmmm, mm.
What kind of sandwich is that?
Chopped yak ears.
It is my mother's favorite recipe.
What am I going to do, Major Healey?
Ahem.
Tell your mother to stick to tuna fish.
Oh, no.
I mean about my master.
Well, why don't you tell him to sell the house and move into an apartment.
He won't have to mow the lawns or wash the windows.
He'll have more time for everything.
Is, uh, this a pickle?
Mm-hm.
You mean if he did not have this house, he would have more time for me.
I thought you said this is a pickle.
It is.
It is a Persian pepper pickle.
Water.
Water, water.
Oh, Major Healey, that is not Don't tell me.
Don't tell me what that is.
Don't tell me what it is.
I'll get the water myself.
Don't tell me.
Hello, Major Nelson's residence.
Hello?
Ahem.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, Major Healey?
Yes, sir.
He's here.
Oh, uh, right away, doctor.
Yes, bye.
Master, I have the most wonderful idea.
Yeah, just a second.
Dr. Bellows wants to see us in his office right away.
His office?
Today's Sunday.
Yeah, but not for Mr. Winkler.
I'll change here, then we'll drop off at your place.
Wait a minute.
But we can't change Master?
Now you have to have time to listen to me.
Huh.
Huh?
You're not gonna believe this.
Master Look, don't gang up on me.
I have tasted things in my life.
All right.
Here.
I had the most wonderful idea.
What?
We will be so happy together.
Oh, master, I think we should sell the house.
Roger.
Roger.
Is that all right, master?
Anything you want.
Roger, what have you done to me?
Roger!
Very well.
I will sell it myself.
Welcome to NASA, Mr. Winkler.
Nice having you with us, sir.
Thank you, gentlemen.
Thank you.
Well, now that we're finished with the small talk, how long will it take you to give a rundown on your evaluation of life-support for Apollo 12?
Uh, Tony will Well, I, uh I  Uh, Mr. Winkler, in all fairness, you weren't expected until tomorrow.
Dr. Bellows, I've made $5 million by getting places quicker than the competition.
And that is exactly the philosophy I intend to use to put the United States first on the moon.
Gentlemen?
Well, I think we could brief you in about six hours, sir.
Think, major.
"About"?
Six hours, sir.
That's what I like to hear.
Let's go, gentlemen.
Wouldn't you rather get settled first?
Take a look around Cocoa Beach?
Find a house?
My wife is taking care of that.
The race is to the swift, Dr. Bellows.
Not to the gum-chewers.
Oh, our first buyer.
Oh, Mr. Merkle, I really think this is going to be too small.
We were looking for something a bit more, uh, elegant.
Well, you never can tell.
A lot of times, these little places will surprise you.
It's worth a quick look.
Well, good afternoon, little lady.
Charlie Merkle, of Merkle, Markle and Fitz.
How do you do, Mr. Merkle-Markle-and-Fitz?
Well, w-won't you come in, please?
Uh, before we bother looking inside, how many bedrooms do you have?
How many would you like?
Well, we'd need at least three.
One for the maid, you know.
Oh.
Well, I can arrange that.
Very quaint.
Very quaint.
It's too small.
Oh, but you have not seen it yet.
Oh, I'm sure it's very cozy and And, uh, charming, but you see, my husband's rather an important man and we need something a bit larger.
Oh, well, my master is an important man too.
Well, of course he is, my dear, but it really is too small.
We were looking for something in the 60,000 range.
All right.
"All right," what?
I will take 60,000.
I'm sure you would, but, uh, 60,000 for this cottage?
I'll bet it doesn't even have a formal dining room.
Come, Mr. Merkle.
My master would not be without a formal dining room.
This way, please.
You call this the formal dining room?
Oh.
No, no, no.
This is the, uh The breakfast nook.
This is the formal dining room.
See?
Who would have believed it?
This way to the chef's kitchen.
You must give rather large dinner parties, Mrs?
Jeannie Uppington-Smythe, with a hyphen and a Y. Why don't we look at the rest of it, Mrs. Uppington-Smythe?
Yes, may we?
Oh, of course.
Would you, um?
Would you care to step out on the veranda?
It's gorgeous.
Unfortunately, you cannot see the tennis courts from here.
They're over there behind the stables.
Ah the billiard room.
My master finds it so relaxing.
This is really the most puzzling house.
So cozy and intimate in here, and everywhere else is like a mansion.
Well, actually, this is my master's favorite part of the house.
It's a real bargain at 60,000.
It's a steal.
Um, it It's not really a bad house.
Not exactly what we wanted, but, uh, it might do.
Do you mind if I use your telephone to call my husband?
Oh, of course not.
Now, this is the area that was modified, sir.
We had a little trouble with the respirator unit last month.
I see.
Excuse me.
Yeah?
Oh, yes.
Just a moment.
It's for you, sir.
Thank you.
Not you.
Oh.
Here you go.
Thank you.
Hello?
Natalie, I told you not to bother me today.
Oh.
That good, huh?
Wait a minute.
Gentlemen, my wife found a house for us.
She wants me to take a look at it before somebody else grabs it.
Would you mind too much if we postponed the rest of this until tomorrow?
Well, we were planning on working, sir.
Oh.
If you feel that way Well, I will make the sacrifice, though.
Oh, Natalie?
What's the address?
Where is that?
That's near your house.
I'll give him directions.
Roger, that is my house.
Oh, that's right.
You better give him directions.
He's trying to buy my house.
Um, um, sir, you You can't leave right now.
Well Heh.
Well, it's only a day, major.
Well, no.
Seventeen hours, You wanna be first on the moon, don't you?
Certainly do.
Eh, look, Natalie, I'm not going to make it out to that house for five hours.
It'll take longer than that, sir.
You said the whole thing would only take six hours.
That's before he knew you were gonna buy his That's before we knew you weren't familiar with the basic specifications, sir.
It'll take at least till midnight.
That'll be too late to see the house.
Hmm.
Natalie, it looks as if I'm not gonna get out until the first thing tomorrow morning.
But dear, if it's such a steal, why don't you give Miss?
Mrs?
What's her name?
Yeah, Mrs. Jeannie Uppington-Smythe.
Give her a deposit.
Jeannie, uh, Uppington-Smythe?
Yeah.
That's the owner.
Come on, gentlemen.
Let's get to it.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Uh, Roger?
You take over, and, uh Me take over?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
I thought you were both going to brief me.
Yeah.
Duplication of effort, sir.
It's wasteful and inefficient, and we don't wanna be inefficient, do you?
We?
Uh, you take over, Roger.
And he's a very comp Comp Yes, sir.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
!
Do you like it, master?
Welcome to your new home, master.
The Capri Riviera Lanai Apartments.
Is it not cozy, master?
And just think, there are no lawns to mow, no hedges to clip.
There will be nothing but time for us together.
Mwah.
Heh, heh, heh.
We're not moving.
Now, let me see.
We're not moving.
I think the sofa will go right there.
Jeannie, this is ridiculous.
I You do not like it there?
Well, perhaps you are right.
It would look better there.
Hey.
No, no, Jeannie.
No.
Jeannie, no.
I'm telling you Oh, and a chair.
I'm tel Ah!
Jeannie, what are you doing?
I don't want Lovely, lovely.
Here.
I tell you, we're not moving.
Oh, but, master, we are already moved.
Yeah.
Where should I put my bottle?
Don't worry about your bottle  Because I'm getting outta here, wherever I am.
Hi.
Hi.
Uh, where's Shirley?
Uh, Shirley?
Mm-hm.
Doesn't she live here anymore?
No, she had to move suddenly.
Um, I'm Yes.
Oh.
That's too bad.
Are you moving in?
Yes, I'm the new tenant.
I'm sure you'll like it.
Well, I'll see you around.
By the pool?
By the pool.
She's, uh, obviously Shirley!
Oh.
Oh.
Pardon me, uh, where's Shirley?
Shirley had to move.
She, uh She moved suddenly.
Oh, I'm glad.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm glad.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
Yeah, yeah.
She's cute.
Yes, she is.
See you by the pool?
Bye!
Yes.
Well, how about that.
I do not like it here.
We will find a new apartment.
Yeah, well, they're all alike.
All of them?
All of 'em.
Well.
I have changed my mind, master.
We are not moving.
Have it your own way, Jeannie, but remember, Mr. Winkler's coming tomorrow to close the deal.
Oh, do not worry about Mr. Winkler, master.
I will give him his deposit back tomorrow, and that will be that.
Ah.
Okay.
Anything you want, Jeannie.
There.
Now Mr. Winkler will not see the house.
Wrong again.
Good morning, Major Nelson.
Oh, good morning, sir.
Oh, uh, Mr. Winkler will be a little late.
He called a few minutes ago and said that he was looking at a house in your neighborhood.
He says it has a tennis court and stables.
I didn't know there were any estates in your area.
Well, it sounds like real-estate agent talk, sir.
You know how they're prone to exaggerate.
Well, it's pretty hard to exaggerate a tennis court.
I mean, either you've got one, or you haven't.
Have you any idea where this house is?
Um Yes, sir, I think I know the house.
But I also think he's not gonna see anything in it.
Ah-ha.
Well, I guess Tony decided to move after all.
Felt like I ran into a door.
It is a door.
And a knob.
It's a doorknob.
Invisible house.
Ha, ha, ha.
Cute.
Very cute.
Oh!
I should have noticed the invisible wall.
Well, here we are, and, uh Anybody?
Ahem.
Any, uh?
Anybody home?
Hoo-hoo.
Don't come down unless you're dressed.
Don't come down unless you're dressed.
Ah.
Jeannie?
Major Healey.
Please, go away.
I don't know if you've noticed, but this house is Is invisible.
I know, I know.
It is according to my master's instructions.
Please go away, Major Healey.
You will spoil everything.
Tony's instructions?
Well, here we are, Mr. Winkler.
It doesn't look like much from the outside.
It sure doesn't.
But I'll tell you this, you're gonna be surprised when you Uh-oh.
It's Mr. Winkler.
That's funny.
I'm sure I came up the right street.
Major Healey?
Is that you?
Mr. Winkler.
Hello, Mr. Winkler.
Ha.
Major, would you mind stepping over here for a minute?
Over there?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir?
Major, would you mind telling me what you were doing over there?
What was I doing over there?
What was I doing?
What?
What?
Oh, I-I was, um I was picking wildflowers.
I'm a great wildflower buff.
Wildflowers.
Is that what you do mornings when you should be at NASA?
Well, now Oh, well, this is a very special day.
The blue lupine are in bloom.
The blue lupine.
Yellow-blue lupine, sir.
Bye, sir.
Not there?
What do you mean, it's not there?
I don't understand, darling.
How can a house I was in yesterday not be there today?
It wasn't there, Mrs. Winkler.
It wasn't there.
You probably wrote down the wrong address.
That's Major Nelson's house.
Then he lives on an empty lot.
I knew it.
Every time something strange happens, Major Nelson is involved.
Let's go, everyone.
We'll soon see exactly what's at 1020 Palm Drive.
Look out.
Look Open the door, will you?
I'm opening the door!
Jeannie, I wanna talk to you!
Look out, Tony, you're gonna hit the  Door.
I thought you said this The house was gone.
Yeah.
Not gone, invisible.
Terrific.
Yeah.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Master.
Are you not proud of me?
I did exactly as you said.
Put it back.
But, master, Mr. Winkler may come by, and then he will see it.
Yes, he's gonna come back and he's gotta see it.
Now, you put this house back just the way you found it.
Go And then get outta here.
Oh, but, master, I really do not think that you should You don't have to think.
All you have to do is follow orders, understand?
Huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes, master.
Well, the house is back.
Jeannie, what?
What are you trying to do to me?
Hey, uh, when did you put in a tennis court?
Huh?
Oh!
And you redecorated your kitchen.
Oh!
Oh, if Dr. Bellows ever sees this Jeannie!
But, Natalie, I'm telling you, an hour ago, this house was not here.
Oh, really.
You should get Dr. Bellows to give you an examination.
You've been having hallucinations.
Hallucinations, my dear, are when you see things that aren't there.
Well, there must be some name for not seeing things that are there.
Come on, darling.
I want you to see the swimming pool, and the stable, and the tennis court.
A swimming pool and tennis court at Major Nelson's house?
This I've gotta see.
Oh, remember, don't let him get past the living room.
Hello Hello, sir.
Uh, Dr. Bellows, I was just on my way to the base.
What are you doing here?
I-I was just on my way to the base.
Just a moment, major.
Mr. and Mrs. Winkler would like to see the house, and so, I might add, would I. I'd love to show you the house, but it's a mess.
Yeah, leaves all over the tennis court.
Where is Mrs. Uppington-Smythe?
Who?
Mrs. Uppington-Smythe.
The young lady who showed the house yesterday.
There's no Mrs. Uppington-Smythe here.
You must have the wrong house.
This is the house, major.
And I intend to show it to my husband.
Come, Erwin.
Well, Mr. Winkler I don't know what you're doing here in the first place.
Mr. Winkler Just a moment, major.
Tennis court and stables?
Not if I can help it.
Is this what you call a formal dining room?
No, no, this is the breakfast nook.
This is the formal dining room.
No, ha, ha.
Whoa!
Well, it's a pretty spacious dining room.
Erwin, I swear to you that yesterday there was a huge formal dining room there with a crystal chandelier.
She's right.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw a chandelier.
MRS.
Major Nelson.
I was in this house yesterday and a Mrs. Uppington-Smythe showed me a formal dining room, and a chef's kitchen, and a billiard room, and a swimming pool, and stable and tennis courts.
Where are they?
Now, now, now, now Don't Don't get upset.
You just made a mistake.
I am not upset.
I know what I saw.
Erwin, come with me.
I am going to show you the swimming pool.
There's really no need to do that, ma'am.
Major Nelson?
I don't know what to say, except that I'm glad it's them instead of me for a change.
MRS.
Don't tell me I'm crazy, Erwin.
I saw the swimming pool here yesterday.
And I saw the tennis courts   Well, I suppose you want an explanation, don't you.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Good morning, master.
Oh.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
Oh, I knew you would be surprised.
I have decided to give your office a good spring cleaning.
Well, that's very kind of you, but it's not spring.
Oh.
Look out.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
What are you doing here?
Nothing.
Oh.
I am out of season.
I can't make lunch, I have to go downtown and register.
Oh, that's okay.
I have to finish these reports, anyway.
Mm.
Register for what?
Oh, it's the state election.
We're electing a new governor.
Oh, what happened to the old one?
Well, I don't know how they did it in old Baghdad.
But here they elect a governor every four years.
Oh, what a lovely idea.
That way everyone gets a chance to be governor.
Who are you gonna vote for, Roge?
I don't know.
I'm not too choked up about either.
I don't trust Abercrombie and Zeigler has no experience.
Do you know who I would vote for?
Who?
Him.
Me?
Thank you very much, but I'm not running.
Oh, you'd make a marvelous governor.
I can see it all now.
Oh.
What have you done now?
Look at that honest face.
Everyone will vote for him.
Nobody's gonna vote for me because I'm not running.
You've got a weak chin.
Thanks, Roge.
And shifty eyes.
I've never noticed the shifty eyes before.
Don't you have to go and register?
All right.
Shifty.
All right.
Goodbye, Shifty Eyes.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Major, about the report.
I'd like you to Governor?
Would you mind explaining this, Major Nelson?
Explaining what, sir?
That campaign poster on the wall.
Oh, that?
Yes, it's just a joke.
Well, I'm not amused.
I don't blame you, sir.
He shouldn't be messing around in politics.
Roger.
For once you and I are in agreement, Major Healey.
Either you're an astronaut or a governor.
You can't be both.
I'm not planning on being both.
As I said, sir, it's just a prank.
Well, get it down.
If General Peterson ever saw it, you'd be in real trouble.
Yes, sir, of course.
There we are, sir.
I suggest you burn it.
Oh, now you've made me late.
I'm on my way to San Francisco in exact Major Nelson.
Oh.
Sorry, sir.
There must have been two of them.
Three of?
There may be one of you in there, sir.
Yes, uh, sorry.
All of them.
Well, you know Jeannie.
She gets overly enthusiastic about these things.
Jeannie, would you come out here a minute, please?
I have been waiting for you to come home, Governor Nelson.
Do you like this?
Oh, yes.
Hey, that's beautiful.
How about this?
Yeah, it's great.
What are you doing?
I'm withdrawing from the campaign.
You do not wish to be governor?
I think I'm finally getting through to you, Jeannie.
Would you please get rid of all these decorations and posters and things, please.
Oh, no, master.
I could never do that to your darling face.
Please, please, right now.
Just get rid of them.
Now.
Why?
You tell her, Roge.
Jeannie, you don't understand politics.
Tony couldn't be elected governor in a million years.
That's right.
I do not know about that, but I do know that he could be elected in three months.
You mean if he ran, he could be elected?
Of course, Major Healey.
I will show you.
Would you like to see your campaign, master?
No.
No thanks, Jeannie.
I-I would.
Show me how this thing works.
Hey, Tony.
Hey, come on and look at this.
No, thanks, Roge.
But, master.
Jeannie, I'm not interested.
Hey, look at the crowd.
Man, are they cheering you.
Cheering?
Do you know what you've got?
You've got charisma.
He has?
Charisma?
And so may I present the next governor of our state, Tony Nelson.
Thank you.
Thank Thank you very much.
Boy, has he got charisma.
Boy, have you got charisma.
Please come and look, master.
All right, Jeannie, but it's not gonna change my mind.
Look at this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
No, it's all right.
She's not too heavy.
Thank you, there you are.
Mwah.
You shouldn't have done that.
Oh?
She has the chicken pox.
Chicken pox?
I am sorry, master.
Hey, let me look.
Hey, whose campaign is this, anyway?
We've had a lot of empty promises.
Now, if I'm elected your governor, I will see to it that those promises are fulfilled.
Yeah?
Well, what about the freeway we're supposed to have?
Look at that old road.
What are you gonna do about that?
Well, I can't build a freeway overnight, but perhaps in five or six years.
Maybe even sooner.
Jeannie.
Do you like it?
Yes No.
But, I wish you would make up your mind.
You people will have your freeways.
The state belongs to the people.
Now, that's a lot of charisma.
Hey, they loved me.
Oh, I told you, master.
You could be the next governor.
Oh, Jeannie, I'm no politician.
He can't turn his whole life upside down just because hundreds of thousands of people adore him.
Yeah.
There we are.
Thank you, my dear.
This is a great day for the state, governor.
I never really thought you'd get this bill through.
I promised you I would, senator.
Remember my campaign slogan: "I have promises to keep".
Does that not grab you?
A billion-dollar highway development program.
Who's going to administer all this money?
My state treasurer will be in charge of all programs on the highway development.
Mr. Roger Healey.
Oh.
That's mine.
You mean, I'm going to administer all that money?
Let me see that again, please?
Oh, certainly, Major Healey.
Who's going to administer all this money?
My state treasurer will be in charge of all programs on the highway development.
Mr. Roger Healey.
You mean, all that money's going to pass through my hands?
Let's see it again.
Let's see the money part again.
Very well.
Oh Me with the handful.
Who's going to administer all this money?
My state treasurer will be in charge of all programs on the highway development.
Mr. Roger Healey.
Tony, I was just thinking.
Since I'm going to be state treasurer Wait a minute, what are you talking about?
I'm in charge of freeway constructions.
No, no, you're not gonna be state treasurer.
You certainly aren't gonna build any freeways.
No freeways.
Good thinking.
Tollways.
We charge $25 a car.
Huh?
Huh?
Ten dollars a car?
What are you talking?
We can get nine thousand million cars at 25 Twenty-five cents, the lowest I'll go for a car.
I have to call my stock broker.
Pull yourself together.
I've got to invest.
You don't have the job.
I don't have the j I don't have the job?
That's right.
You appointed somebody else.
Of course I didn't appoint anybody else.
Then, why would you take the job away from me?
Because there is no job.
I'm not the governor.
If I'm not governor, you can't be the state treasurer.
Of course you're the governor.
It says so in the machine.
But If I run, but I'm not running.
You're not running?
That's right.
You're not running.
Selfish.
You're selfish.
All you think about is you.
You said an astronaut shouldn't get mixed up in politics.
Yeah, well, that was before I became state treasurer.
Don't pursue this any further.
Hold it.
Governor's mansion.
Oh, stop it.
That's the doorbell.
Oh, yeah, that's the doorbell.
Yes?
Major Nelson?
Uh-huh.
I have some mail for you.
Oh, thanks.
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey!
Hey, w Look.
You must have the wrong address.
You must have the wrong Major Nelson.
No, this is the right address.
Governor.
You got my vote.
Oh!
Oh!
Would you stop?
I thought I told you to get rid of all those posters.
Look, you left me with one of these stickers.
Oh, hey.
Money.
Oh, do you know what this is?
What?
Contributions.
Money.
Money.
Contribution for what?
For your campaign.
We're rich, rich.
Rich?
We got to return this, Roge.
Your campaign.
We're gonna be rich.
Give me that thing.
Roger, we have to send it back.
Wait a minute.
I'm the state treasurer.
Yeah.
Take these behind the door.
Get behind the door.
I'm gonna tell this mailman to send this stuff back.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows, how are you?
I thought you were in San Francisco.
I postponed my trip.
I was worried about you.
Oh.
Oh, Major Healey.
Oh!
What is all this?
Are you all right, sir?
Okay?
Oh, these are letters from the family.
They love to write.
Yes, they love to write.
I was just leaving, sir.
We can go together.
What on Earth is that?
That's a machine I run technical films on, sir.
Well, I'd like to see it.
I really don't think you'd be interested.
Of course I would.
After all, I am part of the team.
Uh Major Nelson.
Well, I can explain that, sir.
There's a very good explanation.
Well, you'd better, major.
Shocking.
Absolutely shocking.
Shocking?
Yeah.
That's shocking, yes.
Good morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, master.
You, uh You are not angry with me?
Angry with you?
Why should I be angry with you?
Oh, of course not.
Would you like a cup of coffee?
Oh, thank you, master.
Well, I was afraid that perhaps you were angry because you did not wish to run for governor and I insisted Oh, that.
I've been thinking about it.
You are absolutely right.
I am?
I'd make a great governor.
You mean you're going to run?
It wouldn't be fair to the people if I didn't.
Oh, master!
Oh, I am so happy.
Okay, just sit down and have your coffee.
Now, I'm gonna need your help.
Oh, certainly master.
Anything.
What is it I can do for you?
Well, I want you to go out and get me some votes.
That is easy.
I will go downtown where there are large crowds and tell everyone how wonderful you are.
No, no, I can get all the votes I need here.
What I want you to do is to go to Baghdad and tell all the people about me there.
Baghdad?
Just till election day.
Well, I do not see what good I would do you in Baghdad.
They cannot vote for you.
Oh, no, you're wrong.
There are thousands of people from Florida who live in Baghdad and they can vote for me on their absentee ballot.
But they can't vote for me unless they know I'm running, can they?
I see.
Oh.
You are brilliant to think of that, master.
Yeah, I was kind of pleased with myself.
You better hit the old campaign trail.
Oh, yes, master.
And I will see that the thousands and thousands of people who are in Baghdad from Florida will vote for you.
No man could ask for more.
Uh, have a nice trip, and say hello to your mother for me, will you?
I had better not.
I think you're right.
She's not eligible to vote, anyway.
Goodbye, darling master.
Goodbye, darling Jeannie.
I will miss you.
And I'll miss you.
Goodbye, Jeannie I will see you On election day Jeannie.
Major Nelson.
Oh, Dr. Bellows, General Peterson.
Uh, major.
Major, will you stop that whirling?
Oh, I can't, sir.
It's on automatic timer.
I hate to do this, Tony, but I'm gonna have to ask you to resign from the service.
Resign from the service?
Well, sir, I'm scheduled to go up on the moon shot in three months.
You can't go to the moon and campaign for governor at the same time.
I'm not interested in being governor.
You're not?
No, sir.
I'm an astronaut.
How do you explain that brass band we just passed in the corridor?
You promised me you weren't going to do that anymore, major.
I didn't do it, sir.
Are you telling us all this has been done without your knowledge?
Absolutely, sir.
Absolutely.
You don't have to worry.
My campaign manager is out of town and won't be back.
All right, I'll give you one more chance.
But any more campaigning for governor and you're gonna get your wings clipped.
Do you read me?
Yes, don't worry.
I have everything under control.
It better be, major.
No, The Bowl is not big enough.
We want the largest stadium in Florida.
This is going be the biggest political rally ever.
Right.
Get back to me as soon as you can.
Oh, hi, Donald.
How's it doing?
Look, I want you to set a press conference for 3:00.
I want all the New York papers there.
And get me all the networks.
I want a lot of TV coverage.
And there's gonna be a big shindig at my house.
I want you there at 7:00, prompt.
Right?
Who's gonna be there?
Just the two of us.
Anyway, bye.
Bye-bye.
Governor Nelson's headquarters.
Who said Tony Nelson's not running?
Tony Nelson said he was not running.
Well, what does he know?
Oh, look, the governor just walked in.
I'll get back to you later.
You better call him back.
Why?
I'm giving you five minutes to get rid of everything.
Yeah, but governor, we've got all these posters, we got Look at these.
Put this stuff away, will you?
Wait a minute, what are you doing?
Look at this.
You know what?
Wait, you know what this is?
Contributions, right?
Contributions.
You gotta send this stuff back.
There is no campaign.
"Send it back.
No campaign".
Look at all this money.
Oh, boy.
Where's Jeannie?
She won't let you do this.
You can forget about Jeannie.
I got rid of her until election day.
Now, get rid of all this stuff.
Hi.
Hello, master.
I thought you were in Baghdad.
Oh, I was, I was, master.
I was in Baghdad.
And do you know what I found?
No, what?
The American ambassador, two senior citizens from California on a world cruise, and six oil men from Weatherford, Texas.
There was no one from Florida, master.
You probably didn't know where to look.
Why don't you try the, uh, marketplace?
People from Florida usually hang around the marketplace.
Master, my mother did not raise a stupid genie.
You tricked me!
Attagirl.
Will you keep out of this?
You gotta leave me alone, Jeannie, or they'll throw me out of the space agency.
And then you would be free to be governor?
Oh, Jeannie.
Oh.
But I don't want  Whoo!
Tony Nelson for governor!
What are you doing?
Sounds like a circus.
Uh, look, I'm the state treasurer.
I thought maybe we could get together tonight and discuss the affairs of the state?
Jeannie, would you please.
Jeannie.
They're gonna hear us!
Shh!
Oh, I have not even started yet, master.
Hey!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Ladies and gentlemen, Will you, please?
Will you be a little quiet, please?
Hey, hey, hey, folks, uh, the party's over.
The party's over.
Will you?
The party's over!
Please.
Shh!
The party's over.
Shh!
Shh!
Please.
Shh!
Will you be quiet, please?
Hey, hey, hey, folks, uh, the party's over.
The party's over.
Will you?
Careful.
The party's over.
Shh!
I don't believe it.
But I saw it with my own eyes, general.
There must be 200 people in that office.
It sounds like a circus.
Bands playing, banners waving.
Let's go.
Nice.
Would you like to see my new office?
Okay.
Jeannie, would you, uh, mind, uh: Oh, certainly, Major Healey.
Hey, how about that, huh?
Take a look.
You look right in there.
Right there.
And I'll turn it around.
Can you see all right?
Hey, Tony.
Congratulations.
You're getting married.
Huh?
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh, we are getting married, my darling master.
Let me see.
Oh, no, you don't wanna see that.
Of course I do.
No, no, it's a very dull wedding.
You won't like it.
Major Healey.
How could you do that to me?
Do what?
After I've given you the best years of my life.
The best years of your life were 2000 years ago.
I don't even know this girl.
Then why are you marrying her?
I'm not marrying I'm only going to marry her if I become governor.
Hey, she's kind of cute, isn't she?
I think we're gonna get along fine.
Wait till you see that mob, sir.
You won't believe it.
Shh.
Hey, maybe you could come and visit us, huh?
I'll bet she's a great cook too.
Ooh!
Oh, don't listen to him, Jeannie.
Don't you see?
He's trying to get you to stop the campaign.
Bluebeard!
You'll see, sir.
All right, everybody out He's done it again.
Oh, anything the matter, sir?
Where's the crowd and the band?
What crowd and band is that, sir?
He probably means the girl with the baton and the truck with the loudspeaker.
You told me there was a mob in here, and a band.
I saw them with my own eyes, sir.
You heard the noise.
The noise was probably coming from the machine, sir.
I know that machine.
It has a belly dancer in it.
What?
A belly dancer.
I don't believe it.
See for yourself.
As a matter of fact, I think it's broken, sir We'll see.
Just a moment, sir.
Excuse me, may I just take a look first?
There she is.
It's shocking.
Simply shocking.
You see what I mean?
She was wearing almost nothing.
I'm sorry to have bothered you, Tony.
Doctor, we're gonna find a couch for you and have a nice long talk.
But, the belly dancer.
How long have you been seeing naked women?
Thank you, Jeannie.
Thank you very much.
Well, now that that's over, let's get back to the campaign.
Oh, no, Major Healey.
I am not going to let Major Nelson become governor.
Can you forgive me?
I don't know, Jeannie.
I'd kind of had my heart set on becoming governor.
Oh, dear.
What can I do to make it up to you?
I'll think of something.
Well, you know what they say about politics.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Do you know what I am going to do today, master?
I am going to Paris, to the flea market to get you an antique chest for your bedroom.
And then I am going to Denmark, to get you a stool for the Master?
Master?
Huh?
Master, you fell asleep.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry, Jeannie.
Ahem.
You must stop watching The Late Late Show.
Late Late Show?
I fell asleep during the 6:00 news.
Perhaps you should go back to bed.
No, I can't.
Dr. Bellows is briefing us on the moon flight today.
Oh, you must be excited.
Yeah, can't wait.
Master?
Master?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I will go get you some hot black coffee.
Tony, what in the blazes are you doing in your pajamas?
Huh?
Oh, dear.
He must have gone to NASA in his pajama bottoms.
Oh.
Well, I was sleepy this morning and I guess I forgot to put on my pants.
I just forgot.
Oh.
What pajamas, sir?
Tony, what's going on?
Not 10 seconds ago, you wandered in here in your Wake up, Tony.
What's the matter with you?
Attention!
Uh, two eggs, over easy, with rye, please.
You say he came into your office in his pajamas?
You heard what I said.
Then he started to go to sleep as I was talking to him, and now he's Tony, come back!
Jeannie?
Don't go to the flea market.
Oh, now he's sleepwalking out into the corridor.
Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
I can't talk now.
Major Nelson is in some sort of What's the?
What's the problem, sir?
If you'll recall, sir, there have been times in the past when, uh, strange things have happened to Major Nelson.
And when I brought them to your I'm not talking about the past.
I'm talking about right now!
This man is scheduled for a moon flight.
I don't want him sleepwalking in space.
I feel very fit.
Very fit indeed, sir.
Uh, sir, with your permission, I'll check him over again, just to make sure.
Uh, come along, major.
Nelson!
Get your hat and briefcase.
Yes, of course.
I must have dropped them.
Oh, and, general, when you have time, perhaps you'd like to drop by my office.
There's nothing wrong with me!
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you.
Tony, what's going on?
We had our physical three days ago.
Something terrible has happened.
I don't know exactly what it is.
Hey, wait.
Whoa!
Wait.
Don't talk with your mouth full.
Something weird is going on, Roge.
Oh, I'll say.
You've got a temperature of 86.
Yeah?
Yeah.
That's 98.
Oh, good, you're better already.
Listen, I feel perfectly normal.
But I was in General Peterson's office, and he swears that I was fast asleep.
And I don't remember anything about it.
You don't remember.
No.
Boy, that's bad.
You could talk in your sleep.
You Tony?
Tony, you all right?
Tony, you all right?
Tony.
Tony, you okay?
Jeannie.
Don't say that.
Jeannie.
You've gotta snap out of it.
Boy, you really got it bad Thing is, he said I was talking in my sleep.
You were talking in your sleep, just now.
W-what do you mean, "just now"?
I mean, just now.
Don't you remember?
I went:  And then you And then you did that.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson.
It's just as I suspected.
The lab reports everything quite normal.
Jeannie.
Major Nelson?
Major Healey, what are you doing?
Oh, well, I was just, uh, taking his temperature, sir.
Major Oh!
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Where'd you come from?
Well, I just walked in and found you sound asleep.
Oh, I was just resting my eyes.
Major, you were dead to the world.
Uh, no, sir.
No, sir, I was practicing my conscious relaxation.
Simulated sleep.
Roger and I have developed a technique whereby we can maintain high levels of energy when we're in space flight.
Was that what you were doing in Peterson's office?
Yes, I suppose I was so successful that he really thought I was asleep.
Oh, well, I'll tell him that.
That's very interesting.
That'll be all, gentlemen, you're dismissed.
Oh, yes, sir.
Right, sir.
Uh, major.
Yes?
My "babometer".
I beg your pardon?
My babometer.
Uh, for pressure.
Pressure.
Oh, sorry.
Here.
Thank you.
Uh, major!
Now, would you kindly?
Yes, I would.
Thank you very much.
You should have told Dr. Bellows.
You can't go to the moon if you're gonna fall asleep every time somebody whistles.
I didn't tell Dr. Bellows because whatever I've got, Jeannie must be in back of.
Don't you understand?
Hey, hey, look at that.
Yeah, you're right.
Legs too skinny.
She wasn't that bad.
Huh?
You all right?
Come on, come on.
Master, I swear to you.
I had nothing to do with it.
You must have!
I've never heard of any disease where people fall asleep because somebody whistles.
Maybe it's a rare disease no one ever heard of.
Yeah, like the whistling sleepies.
Yeah, or the sleeping whistles.
Master, are you sure you have no other symptoms?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Oh!
What's the matter?
My knee.
Maybe you pulled a muscle.
What's the matter?
It's my left ear.
Maybe you pulled a muscle in your ear.
Oh, master.
Did you say your right knee and left ear?
Yeah.
Come on, take it eas Oh, dear.
What is it?
What is it?
What's the matter?
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.
What do you mean?
Excuse me, I think I will go visit my mama.
Now, wait a minute, this is no time to visit your mother.
Jeannie.
Oh, great.
You're coming down with the whistling sleepies and she goes home to mother.
Wait.
Oh, what Whoa.
Take it easy.
I didn't whistle, Tony.
Huh?
Didn't whistle.
Tony?
This is a job for old Doc Healey.
Ahem.
Oh.
Ah.
Tony, I'm not just whistling "Dixie," Tony.
He must be getting worse.
He doesn't respond to treatment.
Come on.
Ho-ho.
Whistle, whistle.
What's your favorite song?
Hello, mama, darling.
Oh!
Jeannie.
Oh, my own daughter.
Oh, and as busy as she is, she took time out to see her mama.
Come, come.
We have some coffee.
I had to see you, mama.
You see, my master is I hope you didn't put yourself to too much trouble.
You were here only five years ago.
Oh, it has not been five years, mama.
It has only been two months.
Hm.
Five years.
Two months.
To a mother it is all the same.
I know how difficult it is for you to get here.
You have to blink.
I wouldn't want you to be straining your eyelids.
Well, what brings you here?
Good news, or bad?
Mama, my master is very sick.
Good news.
I'll get the wine.
Mama, I do not want any wine.
I-I want you to help cure my master.
You see, he keeps falling asleep all the time.
And then he has this affliction of the right knee and the left ear.
And it sounds like Mm.
I know what it sounds like.
Too bad.
It looks like you will have to find a new master.
Now it just so happens that I know of this fabulously wealthy sultan.
Mama!
I do not want a sultan.
I want you to help me cure the master I have.
We'll talk about it.
Right now, you go into the kitchen and get something to eat.
And while you are eating, I will show you a picture of the sultan.
Oh, he is so handsome, you wouldn't believe.
Mama, there is no time.
He is getting worse.
She visits me once in five years and she has no time to talk.
Go.
Eat.
That is what they learn in America these days.
Rebellion.
Mm.
Sing.
Will you please say that again, doctor?
I wanna be sure I heard you right.
Conscious relaxation, sir.
He was just simulating sleep.
Yeah, that's what I heard.
Dr. Bellows, you're putting me in a ticklish position.
As commander of this base, I depend on you for medical and psychiatric advice.
What am I supposed to do if my chief psychiatric officer goes off his rocker?
General, I know Major Nelson uh, inside out, and I assure you, there's nothing wrong with him.
Well, in that case, there's only one other possibility.
There's something wrong with me.
Well, general, I, uh Now, that's out of the question!
I want you to put a constant surveillance on Tony for 24 hours.
If he can keep his eyes open for 16 of 'em, I'll turn myself in for a complete checkup.
Uh, yes, sir.
I'll have to go to his house.
What's he doing at his house?
Uh, well, general, I, um I sent him there for a nap.
Ah, if I whistle anymore, I'm gonna sprain my mouth.
Oh, come on, Tony.
Tony.
This ought to work.
Tony, Dr. Bellows is here, he's gonna see Jeannie!
Boy, even the shock treatment doesn't help.
I guess I'm really gonna have to call Dr. Bellows.
Come on.
Come on, little fella.
Up and at 'em.
Oh!
Heavy, heavy.
Up Up against the wall.
Up against the wall.
Not me up against the wall.
You up against the wall.
Up, up Take it easy.
Good, good.
That's a nice boy.
Little, quiet snores, I'm on the phone.
Oh!
Hold on.
Can you hold on?
Up this way.
Up this way.
Up this way.
There we go.
Here we go.
Ho!
Here we go.
Okay.
Hold on.
Hello.
This Dr. Bellows?
Roger.
Fres Fresno, California.
Fresno, California.
All right.
Wrong number.
My fault.
Wrong number.
Roger, correct the attitude.
We're drifting off course.
I'm correcting.
I'm correcting.
I'm calling Dr. Bellows.
Don't worry, old boy.
Everything's gonna be all right, I'm calling Dr. Bellows.
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Don't say "Jeannie".
Don't say Shh!
Don't say, "Jeannie".
Hello.
Oh, this is Dr. Bellows?
Oh, well, I was calling Fresno, California.
Jeannie!
What are you blabbing Jeannie's name for while I'm talking to Dr. Bellows?
Jeannie.
Let's sit down.
Let's go get a chair.
Go get a chair.
We'll sit down.
Let's find a chair.
Oh, no.
You sit in the chair.
Sing, Ahmed.
Another two minutes and Major Nelson won't wake up for five years.
Deedle-deedle Dum-dum Deedle-deedle Dum-dum Deedle-deedle Dum-dum Oh, Mama, you did it.
You are making my master sick.
Don't thank me.
I would do anything for my daughter.
Mama, I am a full-grown genie.
I have a right to choose any master I wish.
Now, you make my master well again or Or I will never come to see you.
Threats, I am getting?
From my own flesh and blood.
Ahmed, you stop singing, I command it.
Don't bother with Ahmed.
He only puts people to sleep.
Waking them up is a little more complicated.
Well, then tell me how.
Please, Mama.
I can't.
I have to do it.
In person.
Well Well, then come with me to our house.
Now.
Well.
What do you know?
After all these years, I am finally getting an invitation.
Mama.
Now.
Please.
I don't go to my daughter's house for the first time without looking ipsy-pipsy perfect.
La-lee, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la A nice hot cup of coffee.
No.
No coffee, huh.
Don't go away.
Sleepy, sleepy.
Coffee's out, huh?
Okay.
Oh, God.
Major Healey.
Uh, where's Major Nelson?
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Is that Major Nelson?
Oh, yes, sir.
Major Nelson said to say hello.
If you don't mind, I'd rather he said hello himself.
Well, sir, actually he has a very sore throat.
Major, would you stop that swiveling?
Oh, we're testing out a new chair for space.
Major.
Stop it.
And that's an order.
Yes, sir.
Uh, well, you see, sir, we're trying to simulate sleep.
Watch this: One.
Two.
Three.
Sleep!
Fantastic how wide awake he is, right?
Oh, major, this man is totally unconscious!
Done something wrong.
Open up your eyes.
Now, Mama, now.
The one in the chair.
Ah.
Children are always in a rush.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, Mama, not that one.
That one is Dr. Bellows.
All right, so I made a mistake.
What's the matter?
You never make a mistake?
Sheesh.
Mama.
You were to have made my master well.
Instead you have made Dr. Bellows sick.
That's the trouble with children nowadays.
Always critical.
Who's that?
Oh!
Oh, this is Major Healey.
My master's best friend.
Major Healey, this is my mama.
Hello.
Is she friendly?
I am not sure yet.
Hm.
Another bum.
Now I am sure.
Mama, I want you to treat Major Healey exactly as you would treat my master.
Oh, no, I'd rather she treat me exactly opposite the way she treated Tony.
Mama, please.
Wake up my master and Dr. Bellows.
No, I think you'd better wake up Tony first.
We don't want Dr. Bellows to see your mother.
So, what's the matter?
I'm not good enough to be seen by your friends?
It is not that, Mama.
It is just that he would not understand your being a genie.
Now, please, Mama.
For me.
Wake up my master first.
Ugly as ever.
And this one.
What is it?
Oh!
A prince.
An emir.
A pasha.
Oh!
A regular sultan!
What is she talking about?
I do not know.
Mama, this is Dr. Bellows, my master's superior officer.
Oh!
And a doctor too.
Oh, all these centuries I have waited for a man I could love.
Jeannie, what is she saying?
Mama, what are you saying?
You have just set eyes on him.
So what?
Our family has always fallen in love quickly.
Look how quickly you fell for that lump over there.
She's got a point there.
Mama.
Mama, this is impossible.
Now Now, please.
I brought you here to cure my master.
All right, all right.
If I promise to cure him, will you stop nudging me?
Anything.
Anything, Mama.
Just please cure him.
Hey, I'm late.
I've got to get to Dr. Bellows' office about that pref light schedule.
What am I doing here?
Huh?
Oh, what is?
What is she doing here?
That's gratitude for you.
Oh, master.
You were sick and mama cured you.
Oh, that's very kind of you.
Thank you, Mama.
Thank you very much for That's That's Dr. Bellows on the couch.
Oh, but that is all right, master.
He is unconscious.
Oh.
You see, mama made a mistake and gave him the same thing you had.
Oh.
That's not all she gave him.
What?
What's going on here, hm?
What's going on?
Well, you see, master, I think we have a little problem.
Mama has fallen in love with Dr. Bellows.
I don't understand it either.
No.
No, t-t-that I'm afraid that's impossible.
Dr. Bellows is a very happily married man.
Only up for 10 seconds and already he's giving orders.
Would you like to go back to sleep again, darling?
Say, for about 1000 years?
Oh, um Do something.
Do Would you do something?
A sleepy little sultan Aye, aye, aye Everybody knows Don't know what to call him But he's Master, I think it would be better if you and Major Healey left, and then I could reason with her.
Yeah.
Hey give the lump this.
In case the sleeping sickness comes back.
Oh, thank you, Mama.
Here, master.
Wear this around your neck.
Have a good day.
Yeah, okay.
Thanks, Mama.
Loved your song.
All right, well, uh Keep trying to reason with her, would ya?
Okay, bye.
Tony?
Oh, Tony.
Oh, get up for me.
You're asleep again.
Come one.
No, I'm just trying to think, Roger.
Don't scare me like that.
Oh, boy.
I knew it.
He's still asleep.
Now where's Dr. Bellows?
This man belongs in a hospital.
Oh.
Oh, no.
It's like we said, sir, uh, simulated sleep.
Yes, I'm just practicing my simulated sleep.
Dr. Bellows must be right.
I am cracking up.
No, sir.
No.
Whatever gave you that idea, sir?
When you came into my room this morning with all that sleepwalking and babbling, I could've sworn you were a sick man, but if you're all right, then I'm seeing things.
You're probably just tired, sir.
There's no use kidding myself.
I better go see Dr. Bellows and get that checkup.
No, um You won't believe where Dr. Bellows is.
Yeah!
Why don't I bring Dr. Bellows to you?
You just lie down on the couch, sir, and I'll I'll bring him over here.
Oh, thanks, Roger, Tony.
I appreciate that.
Well, night-night, sir.
You just rest there and be comfortable.
How are we gonna bring Dr. Bellows to the general when we can't get him out of the house?
One thing at a time, huh?
What thing?
Amanda.
Amanda.
Where are you?
Oh!
Look at that.
Look at that.
He even sleepwalks like a prince.
Shh-shh.
Jeannie, come here.
Any luck?
I am afraid not, master.
She refuses to give him up.
Oh, that's gonna be awfully tough to explain to Mrs. Bellows.
To say nothing of General Peterson.
I'm gonna try my luck.
Oh, master.
There, there, little pasha.
Rest.
Rest.
We are going on a long journey in the winking of an eye.
Uh, um, Mama Uh, Mrs. Jeannie.
What, you again?
I just wanted to offer you my congratulations.
Maybe he's got some class after all.
I just wasn't aware that Dr. Bellows had agreed to become your master.
What?
Oh!
Well, uh He did not exactly agree, master.
He hasn't?
Do you mean to tell me your mother picked a master against his will?
What, "against his will"?
I'm giving him such a shower of riches you wouldn't believe.
Well, frankly, I'm shocked.
Yeah, me too.
Shocked.
To think that your own mother would kidnap a master, really.
All right, all right.
So I'll ask him.
And I wouldn't tell him that your a genie.
Wouldn't be fair.
You want him to love you for your own self.
Don't worry!
Who needs magic to make chicken soup?
Yes.
Loved your dance.
Oh, um, Major Nelson, General Peterson asked me to Who are you?
I am the woman who is going to make happy your declining years.
I beg your pardon, madam?
I'm a happily married man.
You don't like me?
Well, how would I know if I liked you or not?
I've never seen you before.
What am I doing in these things?
Blink him back to NASA.
Yes, master.
Wait!
Wait!
Oh, you haven't tasted my chicken soup.
Oh, miss, uh Ahem, Mrs. Jeannie, uh, if you're looking for a master, maybe, uh Maybe we could work something out.
With you?
You're a lump like the other one.
Forget the whole thing.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Hey!
Yeah.
Yeah, well, I didn't like her singing or her dancing.
Oh, you were brilliant, master.
Yeah, I was, wasn't I?
Now all we have to do is get back to NASA and tell Dr. Bellows Dr. Bellows!
General Peterson!
Jeannie, when you blinked Dr. Bellows back to NASA, did you prop him back in his uniform?
Well, no, master.
You did not say  Blink us back to NASA right away.
Now?
Now!
Now, now, now.
Now!
Now!
Don't try to make me feel better, doctor.
I'm completely buggy.
Why, I believe that you're standing there, wearing Wearing a sultan's robes.
But you don't understand, sir.
I'm the one who's cracking up.
I am wearing sultan's robes, and I haven't the faintest idea where they came from.
It's no use, doctor.
Now I think your robes are gone.
They have gone.
What's happening to me?
Nothing is happening to you.
I'm the one that's going crazy.
With your permission, sir, I'm the one.
Don't you contradict me, I outrank you!
Find me a psychiatrist!
But I am a psychiatrist.
If you're a psychiatrist, I'm sunk.
Well, don't you understand that when I was in school, my professor once told me
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
You know, I really don't think that's what I'm looking for.
Well, what about this?
Okay.
Heh.
Thank you.
Yeah, I think this would be more in line with what What I had in mind.
You know, something kind of casual and subdued.
I'll take this.
Shall I charge it?
Please, yes.
Looks wonderful on you, master.
Oh, you like it?
It is just the thing for Hollywood.
You don't think it's tight at the shoulders?
Oh, no, master.
It is just perfect.
What are you doing in my reflection?
Please take me with you.
I've only been to Hollywood once.
Yeah, once is enough.
Listen, I'm going on Air Force business.
Besides, Dr. Bellows will be sharing a room with me.
I'll only be gone a week.
Oh, but it will seem like a century, master.
Oh, I will miss you so.
Get out.
Oh, no.
Major Nelson?
Major Nelson.
Yeah?
Isn't that carrying personal vanity a little too far?
Just straightening out my tie, sir.
Ah, yes.

But I do not wish to be a star, Major Healey.
I only wish to be with my master.
Well, there you are.
Tony's in Hollywood.
You could be with him.
But I already asked him to take me, and he said that That he would have no time for me.
Well, that's, uh, because he takes you for granted.
I mean, if you were a big star with Hollywood at your feet, he would sit up and take notice.
Do you really think so?
Absolutely.
Do you want to be a?
Do you want to be a big star and have Tony proud of you?
Well, I Or do you want Tony to be alone in Hollywood with beautiful starlets who are crazy about astronauts?
When do we leave?
Now.
I already made the deal with Laugh-In.
Yeah?
Major Anthony Nelson?
Yeah, that's right.
I'm Doug Reynolds, Hollywood Chronicle.
Oh, yeah.
Well, how'd you know I was here?
Oh, it was in the NASA press release.
See, I'm covering the arrival of Princess Armena.
While waiting for her, I thought I'd ask you a few questions about your speaking tour.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry, but, uh, all aspects of Major Nelson's visit were covered in the release.
No personal interviews.
Yeah, but I'm sorry, but those are our orders.
Major Nelson.
Yes.
Excuse me.
But just a few questions.
Sheesh.
Now, major, I've marked it all down in this little book.
The first place we're going to see is Hollywood and Vine, uh, Grauman's Chinese, then Disneyland.
Sir, you go without me.
I'm not much of a hand at sightseeing.
I have a report to do.
Major, major, that must be the princess that reporter talked about.
Oh?
Tell me, princess, how long you figure on staying in Hollywood?
I'll answer the questions.
That's Roger, R-O-G-E-R, Healey, Healey.
Excuse me.
Uh, no more, no more, gentlemen.
All right, one more picture.
One more picture.
Get the two of us together.
How's this?
You got that?
Get the picture?
All right, that's it.
We'll have a press conference in my office a little later.
We'll go up to the hotel room right here.
Perhaps I can take a picture.
Amanda will be thrilled.
Put that down.
I only want a picture.
I can't see her.
Sir, you gave orders not to be conspicuous.
That's strange.
That fellow there, he looks exactly like Shall we go sightseeing?
Well, I thought you weren't interested.
Tell me something, princess  And maybe Maybe to Grauman's Chinese.
What do you say?
Oh, sir.
Wait a minute!
Uh, Roger Healey, please.
Yes.
Hello, Roger?
Roger?
Roger, what are you and Jeannie doing in Hollywood?
Can't talk to you now, T.N., I'm in the middle of a press conference.
Uh, who's T.N.?
And what is the press conference all about?
T.N., big-time producer.
Look, I know how badly you want her, but I I couldn't let her go for less than a mil.
But I'll keep you in mind.
Okay.
Nice talking to you.
Roger?
Roger?
!
Smile, major.
Cheese.
Uh, no more calls, doll.
Didn't I tell you?
When the princess makes her American television debut, we'll have to beat 'em off with clubs.
Didn't I tell you guys?
Oh.
Heh.
Are you going over that speech of yours, major?
Yes, sir.
I'm just taking a look at the notes.
Oh, give my very best to Mrs. Bellows, would you, please?
Oh, thank you, major.
That's very thoughtful of you.
Good heavens, major, what are you doing?
!
I'm just checking the light, sir.
It, uh It's plugged in now.
Well Yeah, aren't you going in the wrong direction, major?
The Princess Armena's in there.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's 606.
I thought it was 604.
They look so much alike.
Yeah.
Who is it?
Uh, bellboy.
Telegram.
Thanks.
Huh?
Roger!
Roger.
Hi.
Yeah, no tip, huh, major?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Major Nelson.
What are you doing?
Major Nelson!
Hey.
Practicing space flight, major?
Master?
Master, I must talk with you.
Oh Master, it is I, Jeannie.
Major Healey told me not to talk to you, but I miss you so much.
I could not wait.
Amanda.
Amanda.
Oh, dear.
Amanda, your hand is as soft as lily of the valley.
Jeannie.
Go back to sleep, Albert.
Alfred.
Alfred.
Yes.
Huh?
Shh.
We should be quiet.
Just be calm.
Okay.
Master.
Master.
Jeannie.
Shh.
Oh, master, I have been so lonely without you.
You told me you would only be gone a week and you have been gone a long One day.
One day.
I don't know what you're doing here, but I want you back in Cocoa Beach.
Hold it!
What a story: "Astronaut and the Princess Armena in Midnight TÃªte-Ã -TÃªte".
This is not what you think, not at all.
Major Nelson.
Yes, sir?
What's going on here?
You told me he fell out of the window trying to fix the window shade, huh?
Yeah, he's been trying to get in her room all day.
Oh, thank you, folks.
This'll make a whale of a story, I promise you.
Major Nelson, come back to this room immediately.
Yes.
Master, what shall I do?
You stay in your room.
I'll see you in the morning.
Major Nelson.
But, mas  Major, I'm astounded, utterly astounded.
After I told you we had express orders to avoid undue publicity, you get involved with a Sleepwalking?
Major, this is absurd, absolutely absurd.
Are you trying to tell me that you were walking in your sleep when you just accidentally happened to bump into the Princess Armena?
Oh, major, wake up.
Wake up.
Oh, I don't believe this for an instant.
This is remarkable.
Sorry.
It's okay.
Excuse me.
Hey, you're Major Nelson.
Yeah.
You're Judy Carne.
Right.
From the Laugh-In.
Yeah.
How about that?
And you're the astronaut.
Well, how'd you know that?
Oh, you're putting me on.
I've seen the morning paper.
Oh, let me see.
It's really romantic.
Yeah.
Well, there was a little misunderstanding last night.
I-I was walking in my sleep, and this idiot photographer came out, had to snap Sure, major.
Sure.
You know, sock it to me.
Oh, boy.
Heh.
You know Major Healey?
You mean, Princess Armena's manager?
Oh, sure.
He's gonna let her appear on the Laugh-In.
The beds have already been made up.
I know who you are.
Do you know who I am, Roge?
Huh?
You know me?
You're Judy Carne.
Hi.
What's with him?
Space fatigue.
Hm.
Would you like to sit down?
Yeah.
Princess?
Oh, master.
Oh, master, I'm so glad you came.
I did not get a chance to tell you.
I am going to be a TV star.
You're gonna be en route to Cocoa Beach.
Oh, but wait.
Master, I am not a TV star yet.
Well, you know how these mad, passionate love affairs are.
No.
How are they?
Well, they can't be separated for a moment.
Hm.
Looks like they can't bear to be together for a moment.
Yeah, well, as I said before, space fatigue.
Sure.
I'm sorry, Jeannie, but your show business career is over as of now.
Are you there, major?
Yes, sir.
I'll get it.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Roger.
Well, where is she?
The princess has retired to her bottle.
Tony, you can't do this to me.
This is my one chance to be rich and famous.
Yeah, well, good luck.
Wait a minute.
You don't understand.
I signed a contract.
If she doesn't appear, they'll sue me.
This is my I'll be washed up in Hollywood.
If she does appear, I'll be washed up Who is it, major?
Maid service, sir.
They wanna know when to make up the room.
Hm.
This is very interesting.
What's in it?
Uh, after-shave lotion.
I picked it up at the drugstore downstairs.
Good.
Do you mind if I try?
I'm about to shower and shave.
Well, I'd kind of rather Rather you didn't.
Well, tell the maid to make up the room in 10 minutes.
Yes.
Uh, make up the room in 10 minutes.
Dr. Bellows, sir.
Doctor?
Doctor  Don't Don't use that after-shave lotion, sir.
Dr. Bellows?
Oh.
Dr. Bellows?
Dr. Bellows?
Sir?
Uh I'd rather that you Tony, Tony, I'm on my knees.
You've got to let Jeannie appear on that show.
I'll be washed up in show business.
This is my only chance to be Roger, Roger, Roger, shut up.
All right.
All right?
If you can get her out of the bathroom, she's yours.
She's mine?
Oh, I knew you wouldn't let me down.
You're a friend.
Stop it.
Who's that?
That's Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows is in the bathroom?
With Jeannie.
Dr. Bellows is in the bathroom with Jeannie?
He thinks she's a bottle of after-shave lotion.
Oh, I need a drink.
Oh, do I need a drink.
Oh, I'm sorr Roger.
Oh, master, let me out.
He's finished showering.
He's gonna shave.
Look, Tony, we've been together a long time, and I want to tell you one thing: That when he opens up that bottle I know.
You're gonna be standing right beside me.
Wrong.
I am going to be on a plane halfway to Cocoa Beach.
All right, if you're gonna go, go.
I got enough troubles without you hanging around and confusing the issue.
I don't know where they went.
I believe you.
I haven't seen anybody.
Hey, that's him.
That's her manager.
What's holding you up?
We're double-parked.
Art Arte Johnson.
You're Arte Johnson.
Yeah.
Arte Johnson.
Yes.
That's Arte Johnson.
That's Arte Johnson, yes.
Arte Johnson and Judy Carne.
Uh, yes.
Uh, major, this is Arte Johnson.
Major Nelson, you know Judy Carne, of course.
Hi.
Uh, major, we realize that you and the princess are a hot item, but we have no time.
We've gotta be there in half an hour.
You mean, the princess was over here?
In the major's room?
Very interesting.
Where is she?
Oh, she's in freshening up.
Something probably happened.
I'm almost finished, major.
I'll say something happened.
Well, there goes the electric razor.
Armena shaves?
Why not?
She has a face.
Uh, Dr. Bellows?
Why don't the three of you go over to the studio, I'll bring her along later?
And miss her entrance?
I wouldn't miss that for the world.
Major Nelson, what's the meaning of this?
!
Major Nelson, you call this after-shave lotion?
I don't know, sir.
What do you call it?
Oh, it smells like skunk.
Must be something wrong in the factory.
Air.
Air!
I must have a breath of air.
When I get you back to  Oh, oh.
Major, what on earth are you doing?
!
Huh?
Major, what happened?
You really socked it to him.
Yeah.
Major, who are these people?
Oh, I-I Are you registered in the hotel?
You're in the wrong room.
I'm Dr. Bellows.
Great heavens!
I'm not dressed.
I thought we did far-out things on Laugh-In, but this is too much.
Hey, where's the princess?
We're gonna be late for the show.
Well, I have it on very good authority that she's not gonna do the show.
Not gonna do the show?
She has to do the show.
Her agent signed a contract.
Yeah, I know.
But she told me that she's retiring from show business.
Well, she's making a comeback.
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
Roger!
Confusing.
But very interesting.
Roger!
Come back here, Roger!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Jeannie, where?
Where's my hat?
Hm?
Oh, it is in the dining room, master, with your briefcase.
Oh.
Whoops.
Hey, what are you reading?
Oh, it It is called The Genie Journal, master.
The Genie Journal?
It is a special magazine written just for genies.
It has recipes and new techniques, where to eat in Beirut, that sort of thing.
Well, I've never seen it around here before.
Oh, well, Mother sent this one.
You see, it has a large section on how to find a new master.
Yeah, she was always known for her subtlety.
Uh, look, I'll be home around 6:00 tonight, so you don't have to do any fancy cooking.
So I'll Oh, uh, no, I don't want a big breakfast.
I'll just settle on some fruit, Jeannie.
Oh Oh!
Uh, what's going on, here?
This fruit was fresh yesterday.
I just bought it.
Master, I am so sorry.
You see, there's a new recipe in The Genie Journal that tells how to turn organic material into porcelain.
And I was, uh I was trying it out.
Yeah, well, I've bitten into wax fruit before but this is ridiculous.
Oh, I'm sorry, master.
Here's a fresh apple.
Oh, thanks.
Do me a favor, will you?
Warn me before you try out any new recipes on me.
Oh, yes, master.
I'll see you tonight.
Have a nice day, master.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, hello, major.
Where's Major Nelson?
He'll be right along, sir.
About Saturday night.
Could you get somebody to replace me?
Oh, that's out of the question.
Roger.
Sir.
Oh, uh, good morning, major.
Have you got that report?
Oh, yes, sir.
Right here.
Something the matter, major?
Oh, no, no.
Fine, fine.
Tony, where?
Where?
Where did you buy your hat?
Major Nelson, this is pottery.
Yeah, porcelain, actually, sir.
A porcelain hat?
Oh, Tony, you should know better than that.
Regulations say a hat should be made of wool or twill.
That'll do, major.
Well, Major Nelson?
Well, sir?
Well?
Well?
Oh, yes.
Uh, well, uh, the explanation is very simple, sir.
Simple?
Yes, very simple.
How simple?
Hm?
Oh, well, I've taken up pottery, sir.
Very relaxing.
You really ought to try it.
All right.
I'll accept that.
It's no more ridiculous than some of your other explanations.
However, in the future I'd appreciate very much if you'd confine your potting to pots.
Of course, sir.
Now, if you'll give me your report, I'll leave you to clean up that mess.
Uh, well, there are a few things I'd like to add to it I'm sorry, major, but Washington expects that report immediately.
I understand, uh, it's in your briefcase.
Yes, that's correct, sir.
Well?
Would you mind, uh, stepping back, please?
Would you, Roger, step back?
Here's the report, sir.
Your report is in pottery.
Porcelain.
Uh, like the Babylonians, sir.
If you remember, some of their records lasted for thousands of years on porcelain, or crockery, or pottery, or Yes.
Thank you.
Boy, turning your briefcase into pottery?
Man, that's dumb.
That's dumb.
That's dumb.
What do you want me to turn it into?
It's not dumb.
Jeannie was just trying out a spell she read in a genie magazine.
Yeah, but porcelain?
How about gold?
Yeah, well, who would want a gold briefcase?
Yeah, who would want a gold briefcase?
Who?
A gold briefcase?
Yeah, you're right.
How about a gold suitcase?
Wait a minute, how about a gold steam iron?
How about a steam?
Come on.
Jeannie, I'm home.
Do not come in yet, master.
Yeah, she's probably fixing your frozen porcelain dinner.
Oh Frozen porcelain dinner.
You get it?
Just a little Jeannie?
Jeannie!
He's back.
What's back?
Djinn Djinn, the invisible dog.
It's the invisible dog.
He's back.
Ah!
My shoe!
Djinn Djinn!
Djinn Djinn!
Stop it immediately.
Get it away, get it away.
Stop it, Djinn Djinn!
Ooh Ah!
Master, you should get it.
You shouldn't have come in with your uniform on.
You know how uniforms upset him.
What am I supposed to do?
Do a striptease on the porch?
Well, of course not.
I was gonna blink you both out of uniform.
Oh, oh, puppy.
Poor baby.
Come on.
Come on.
Just stop him!
Wait a minute!
Would you two mind arguing about it after you blinked?
Oh, of course.
Yeah Jeannie, where's the dog?
Where's the dog?
Oh!
Oh, darling little Djinn Djinn.
Pet him so that he will know that you are happy to see him.
I don't want to pet him.
I'm not happy to see him.
Ah!
I'm delighted to see him.
Me too.
I'm happy Happy.
Oh, I'm happy.
How long is the little fella gonna be staying with us?
Oh, not very long, master.
But you must remember to stay out of uniform while he is here.
Yeah, we can both wear our summer porcelains.
Ha-ha-ha.
Coffee's almost ready, dear.
Thanks.
What in the world is that?
Well, oddly enough, it's one of Major Nelson's reports.
For some unknown reason, he did it on pottery.
Just like the Rosetta Stone.
Hm.
Here, let me see it.
Oh, Amanda, please.
I have to mail that to Washington.
Oh, that reminds me.
I must put that in a box marked "fragile".
Oh, this is very interesting.
But it's It's not really like pottery.
It's more like fine oriental porcelain.
Oh, Amanda, don't be ridiculous.
He says he just took it up as a new hobby.
Well, then, he's a genius.
Remember last year when I took that Art Appreciation course?
Well, Dr. Farber, he showed us some fine oriental porcelain.
And darling, this is exactly the same quality.
Oh, Amanda, what are you doing?
I'm calling Major Nelson.
Well, what for?
What for?
Because I want to see the rest of his work that's what for.
What?
Oh, fine, four, yes, five   Come on, Djinn Djinn.
Sic him!
Sic him, Djinn Djinn!
Get him, get him, get him!
Come on, Djinn Djinn.
Get him, Djinn Djinn.
Get him.
Come on, Djinn Djinn.
What's the idea of the invisible bit?
I didn't even have my uniform on.
Oh, well, master, sometimes he disappears when he gets excited.
Hello?
Yeah, he's right here.
It's kind of unnerving to Oh, hello Mrs. Bellows.
No, no, this is Major Healey.
How are you?
Oh, fine.
Fine, thanks.
Oh, no, just come over any time.
No problem at all.
Right.
Goodbye.
Uh, Roger, who is it?
Oh, that's the Bellows'.
Mrs. Bellows wants to come over and see the rest of your pots.
What do you mean she's coming here?
Well, you told Bellows you were taking up pottery as a hobby.
I couldn't very well tell him Jeannie made all that crockery.
That shouldn't be too hard.
Just show him Jeannie's crockery.
That's a good idea.
Jeannie, uh, get to the garage and turn it into a workshop.
Uh, put in a potter's wheel and spread some crockery around.
Instantly, master.
Wait a minute, I'm not finished.
Uh, don't make the crockery too good.
You know, make it kind of amateurish-looking, okay?
What are you waiting for?
Are you finished yet?
Yes, I am.
Oh.
Wait a min!
The dog!
The dog!
The dog!
Quick!
Djinn Djinn!
Djinn Djinn?
Djinn Djinn, Djinn Djinn,  Oh, there he is.
Oh, come on, Djinn Djinn.
Come on, baby.
Ooh, there we go.
Oh, look out.
Give him Give him his towel.
All right.
Take the towel.
Give him the towel.
Take the towel.
Yes, take all the towels.
Now?
Now.
Oh, boy.
Yeah.
Thank goodness your head isn't porcelain.
Oh, well.
There you are, Djinn Djinn.
Now, let us see.
There.
I am ashamed to do such shoddy work.
But that is what my master wants.
That is what he wants Oh!
Djinn Djinn, no, no, no, you naughty dog.
Now.
Now, go on.
Go on.
I am doing important work for my master.
Go on.
All right, now.
Let me see.
Ooh.
Ugly.
Hm.
Let me see, now.
Here.
Whoo!
Terrible.
Oh, dear.
I do not want Mrs. Bellows to think my master is a complete amateur.
I will do something just a little special.
Let's see if I can remember the recipe.
Right eye.
Left eye.
Both eyes twice.
Oh!
Oh, my goodness.
My poor little Djinn Djinn.
What did I do?
It did not work.
Do not worry.
Do not worry.
The Genie Journal.
There must be an antidote.
Okay, let me see.
Let us see.
What does it say?
Oh, dear.
Oh, here it is.
Yes.
Let's see.
Hm.
"Homemaking ideas, new spells for old porc" Oh, dear.
Well, there's no recipe for turning things back.
Do not worry, Djinn Djinn.
I will go home to To Baghdad and ask Mama.
Or Or Haji, or Someone.
Oh, thank you, major.
Uh, did you make these too?
Oh, no, no, no.
I only took up pottery because Dr. Bellows said that, uh, doing something with your hands would be relaxing.
Well, there's no need to go to extremes, major.
In the future, I'd like your reports to be on plain, Government Issue paper.
Oh, Alfred, don't be such a fuddy-duddy.
It It's perfectly obvious that Major Nelson is an artiste.
Oh, major, may I see the rest of your things?
I'm really very excited about all this.
I don't want you to be disappointed.
My stuff's pretty crude.
Oh, major, you're much too modest.
Uh, the crockery is ready.
Huh?
Oh, good.
Uh, right this way, please.
Amanda.
Thank you, dear.
I'm really very excited about this.
I know.
Now, if you If you see anything you like, just tell me and I'll make you a present of it.
Thank you very much, major.
Well, it's all very nice.
It's just, uh it's not quite what I'd expected.
Yeah, well, I tried to keep the crude approach, you know?
Like Like this one.
It's a kind of a simplistic form.
I think you've succeeded, major.
Uh, Amanda, have you seen enough?
Yes, I have, darling.
Thank you very much, major.
It's, uh, all been very interesting.
Oh, all right.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, I like this very much.
May I see it?
Yes, well, this is the crude form I've been What is that?
No, darling, come look at this beautiful little dog.
Huh?
Oh, yeah.
Well, that That's just a little dog I whipped up.
It's been a A pleasure having you here.
And I I'm sure Oh, this is exactly what I was looking for, major.
Darling, look at this.
Isn't that exquisite?
Where did that come from?
I don't know.
It was there when I got here.
What do you mean?
I told Jeannie to keep it crude.
Pull this thing off.
What are you doing with this on your hand?
Just pull it.
Look at the detail, Alfred.
The intricate craftsmanship.
It's so lifelike.
Major?
Yes?
Major, you know, you said if I If I really found something that I like that I could have it?
Yes.
Well, I like this.
Huh?
Uh, well Uh, now Dr. Bellows.
Wait a minute, wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
It fits your hand.
I'll take this, huh?
Roger Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Excuse me, Roger.
Jeannie, come on out.
Jeannie Jeannie?
Jeannie, come on out, please.
We gotta find that dog.
What are you worrying about?
Mrs. Bellows will probably put it on her knickknack shelf and that'll be that.
Yeah!
And in a matter of hours, I'll be the master potter of the space agency.
I'd sure like to have the concession on all this stuff.
I know what.
Uh, tomorrow we'll go to Mrs. Bellows' house and we'll smash it.
What?
Smash it!
Boy, you sure don't take pride in your work.
Oh, excuse me, doctor.
I think that's them.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Bellows.
Hello, Major Nelson.
Major Healey, won't you come in, please?
There's someone I want you to meet.
Right this way.
Please.
Major majors, rather, I would like you to meet, uh, Dr. Farber.
This is Major Nelson and Major Healey.
He is an authority on fine oriental porcelain.
How do you do, sir?
Is this the one?
He's the one.
I want to ask you about the porcelain dog.
Oh, that little dog, sir?
Oh, just something I whipped up.
Yeah, it's pretty.
Heavy too.
Pretty heavy.
Ooh!
Good heavens!
What are you doing?
Oh, just clumsy.
I'll hold it, sir.
Please be careful.
Yes.
You're holding one of the most valuable porcelains in the entire world.
What, this is valuable?
Mm.
Oh, now, I'm afraid not, sir.
Uh, I It's the first effort of a rank amateur.
All right, major.
You can drop it now.
Huh?
I said you can drop it.
Well, if that's what you want, Mrs. Bellows What is the matter with you two?
Well, she told him to drop it.
Not the dog.
The pretense.
Major, you did not make this dog.
I didn't?
Not unless you're Lum Chung Sing, the finest maker of porcelain in the 15th century.
And this is his masterpiece.
The Peking Dog.
The finest example of the potted art.
Uh, no, sir.
I I made that dog.
Not in a thousand years could this be duplicated.
I made the dog, didn't I, Roger?
Didn't you see me make it, huh?
What about that tablet with the report on it?
I suppose that was 15th century too.
Doctor, I must admit I am a bit confused.
I'm afraid I made the dog, sir.
Anybody can make a mistake.
Uh, that's not worth the time it takes to smash it.
Major!
Major, please!
It's worth more than a quarter of a million dollars.
A quarter of a million dollars?
This?
Oh, come on Oh!
No!
Oh, oh, oh!
Mrs. Bellows, please, let me have it.
It's for a museum.
No, no, no.
No museum.
No, he gave it to me.
Wait, wait Oh, please, don't break it.
No!
Oh!
That's it.
Yeah.
What's going on, here?
?
?
?
What's going on, here?
What's the matter with you?
I'll take care of this.
Do you mind?
I'm keeping the dog until this thing is straightened out and I'm putting it in a safe place.
In the NASA vault.
I never ask any favor before.
I'm asking.
Just let me be I've never been near a quarter of a million dollars before.
Oh, Roger, will you get off your knees?
You're embarrassing.
Somebody's gotta be here in case Jeannie comes back.
I left a note for her at home telling her to meet me here.
What am I supposed to tell her?
Tell her to smash that dog.
Oh, no, don't smash it.
I'm sorry, Roger.
It's the only way out, Roge.
Wait a minute.
What if she doesn't come back?
Then I'll smash it.
Oh, don't smash it.
This is my career.
I'm in the space program.
I'm an astronaut.
I can't.
With a quarter-million we can buy our own space program.
Boy, isn't anybody dishonest anymore?
You put a pottery dog in my vault?
Porcelain.
For safekeeping, sir.
You see, there's a pottery expert who insists that Major Nelson didn't make it.
But that it is, in fact, a rare oriental porcelain.
Oh, you're beginning not to make sense again, doctor.
Oh, it'll clear up, general, uh, just as soon as Dr. Farber arrives.
Uh, he's the expert.
He says that he's uh, bringing proof positive that the dog belongs in a museum.
What would Tony be doing with a museum piece?
I don't know, sir.
Uh, but there's one thing that supports Major Nelson.
Uh, the dog bears a striking resemblance to that nasty little brute who got loose in here several months ago.
Uh, Major Nelson says that he did the statue from memory.
You mean that hound that nearly destroyed the place?
And he's in my safe?
In pottery, sir.
You said porcelain.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
Oh, but he's perfectly harmless.
I hope so, doctor.
Oh, I hope so.
Yeah, a quarter of a million dollars.
That's a lot of money.
Oh, that's 500,000 That's a million quarters.
Twenty-five million dimes.
Boy, I wonder what that is in trading stamps.
Major Healey?
Have?
Have you seen Djinn Djinn?
Oh, he's in General Peterson's safe.
What is my dog doing in a safe?
You don't mean the dog.
You mean the statue of a dog.
Well, that is no statue, Major Healey.
That is Djinn Djinn.
You see, I made a mistake and turned him into porcelain and I have been in Baghdad getting the antidote.
Why did they think it was from the 15th century, then?
Oh, well, that is easy.
You see, when Djinn Djinn was a puppy, a Chinese artist named Lum Chung Sing did him in pottery, and I must say it turned out rather well.
Oh, you'd better go and tell Tony.
Oh No!
No.
No, I'll I'll tell Tony.
Oh, well.
Seven trillion trading stamps?
There it is, general.
The Peking Dog.
That picture was taken at the Imperial Museum in 1922.
What do you say to that, Tony?
Oh, well, that's impossible, sir.
Uh, that statue was modeled after that little dog I had a couple of months ago.
I suppose you remember.
I certainly do.
I still got the scars.
Yes, well, if you just open the safe, sir, you'll see a remarkable resemblance.
All right, Tony.
I hope the dog is all right.
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Amanda.
What could happen to the dog?
Tony, I gotta talk to you.
Huh?
No No, he's opening the safe now.
That's what I want to talk to you about.
Well, we'll soon see, won't we?
Now, let me see if I can remember.
Uh, two blinks, left eye.
One blink, right eye.
Twenty-seven Ah, sir, please!
Don't open Not now Not now Don't open it now.
What's the matter with you, Tony?
You wanted me to open it.
Not now.
Just not now.
Not the time.
Oh, he knows that I'm right.
No, no, he's not right All right, general, feast your eyes on that.
Ouch!
He bit me!
A pottery dog bit you?
He's not a pottery dog.
He's He's gone!
Ha!
Gone, that's what he is.
Gone.
Oh, God!
It's that brute!
Run for your lives!
He's a killer!
Oh, now he's got my sleeve.
Get off!
Roger, get him.
Get him?
Get him?
Get him?
He's got me.
General, what's happening to him?
Don't panic.
Don't panic.
Come on Ooh!
I don't understand!
I don't see anything!
Oh, he's eating his pants of!
Oh, calm down.
General, general, it's all right, sir.
Don't panic.
Call the Air Police!
Call the dog catcher!
Call the Marines!
We need reinforcements!
Doctor, you put that brute in my safe.
What kind of a mad fiend are you?
General Peterson, I tell you it was pottery.
No, it wasn't It was alive.
I saw it.
Alfred?
Take me home.
Oh, hello.
I believe I have the explanation for you, Dr. Bellows.
I doubt it.
I doubt it.
I'm afraid it was all my fault.
You can say that again.
You see, little Djinn Djinn here, I brought him to visit with his good friend, Major Nelson.
But I'm afraid the naughty little boy got away from me.
And he jumped through your window.
Madam, please, take him away.
It was a pottery dog.
I tell you I put a pottery dog in that safe.
This was not done by a pottery dog.
Then where's that statue?
A pottery dog, you say?
Well, very mysterious.
Oh, my goodness.
Naughty Djinn Djinn.
He must have gotten you all so upset you didn't notice the little statue had fallen out.
There it is.
The Peking Dog.
It's broken beyond all repair.
Oh.
Gone forever.
Oh, I wouldn't say that, honey.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Can I see your license, please.
What's the problem, officer?
No problem, except you were going 30 miles an hour in a 20-mile zone.
Twenty-mile zone?
We didn't see any sign.
It's right on that "Welcome to Clarkston" sign, plain as the nose on your face.
Where is the "Welcome to Clarkston" sign?
Right behind that big oak tree.
The fine will be $25.
Wouldn't it be easier to just put up a toll gate?
Couldn't do that, son.
That wouldn't be legal.
You can just mail it in, or you can hang around here for a week if you want to plead not guilty.
No, thanks.
No, thanks.
Any place I can get some gas around here?
Yeah, I guess old Ev's open.
Ninety-five cents a gallon for gas.
Ninety-five cents a gallon?
But he gives trading stamps.
Trading stamps?
Shut up, Roger.
Thank you, officer.
Sorry.
Who tapped us, Thelma?
Strangers, Edgar.
We're in luck.
You maniacs!
You hot rodders!
Just look what you've done to my husband.
Lady, I barely touched the car.
What happened, Thelma?
It was them.
They just came barreling right into us.
Barreling into you?
Wait a minute, that's an out-and-out lie.
Cool it, Roge, let's get out of this burg.
Hold on, son.
I don't know how you do things in the big city, but in Clarkston, we don't hit and run.
You're under arrest.
Master?
Master?
Major Nelson's office.
Hello, this is Dr. Bellows.
May I speak to Major Nelson, please.
Who is this?
This is This is Sergeant Wiggins.
Do you know where Major Nelson is, please?
That's what I want to know.
Didn't you say you were in his office?
Yes, but he is not here.
Do you know where he is?
He went on a fishing trip with Major Healey, but they should've been back yesterday.
Have him call me as soon as you hear from him.
Yes, sir.
And you have him call me as soon as you hear from him.
Sergeant is Major Nelson in the habit of reporting to you?
No, sir.
But I would like him to be.
Peculiar.
Officer, this is a frame-up.
That man wasn't hurt.
Well, we'll let the judge decide that.
Wait a minute, I demand a writ of habeas corpus.
Cool it, Roge.
You're gonna make it worse.
Don't worry, I can handle these hicks.
And furthermore,  All right now, what's that supposed to mean?
It means all of Gaul is divided into three parts.
He took high-school Latin.
Now, you watch it, boy.
We don't cotton no foreigners around these parts.
Inside.
Not you.
He was driving the car.
Wait a minute, he's my buddy.
Where he goes, I go.
Suit yourself.
I thought you wanted to go where he goes.
I just did, and I hated it.
I'll probably be able to handle things out here better.
I'll call Jeannie.
I don't want Jeannie.
I want some justice.
Officer, I believe I have a right to be brought up in front of a judge.
All right, now just hold on, son.
You can't go hitting and running at 8:00 in the morning, and expect folks to be standing around waiting on you.
Soon as Elroy gets up and gets hisself some breakfast, why, we'll take you up before him.
Now you Don't you leave town.
You're a material witness.
Why don't you let me call Jeannie?
She'll get you out with a blink.
No, Jeannie will just make things worse, Roger.
I'll be out of here, like that, as soon as I see the judge and tell him what happened.
Especially after he takes a look at that phony victim.
That's impossible.
There is nothing wrong with that man.
Order in the court.
Now In the case of Crawford v. Nelson, trial is set for 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.
Bail will be $100.
Court is adjourned.
You had your breakfast yet, Sam?
Yep, but I'll stop and jaw with you a bit, Elroy.
Your honor, I don't have $100.
I've got $29.95.
Well, I guess you'll have to enjoy our hospitality until tomorrow.
How about my watch, here.
It must be worth at least $100.
It tells the date, the time, and the rela Relative humidity.
Real pretty.
About the only thing it don't tell is the time.
It must have been broken in the accident.
Roger!
Take him away, Joe.
By the way, son.
You're allowed one phone call.
Local.
Thank you, sir, thank you.
Who would I want to call in this town?
You could call me, I'll be at the hotel.
I'd love to hear from you.
Don't help me anymore, I don't need your help!
I don't need your help!
Wait a minute  Thank you, thank you.
Oh, boy.
Hi, pal.
I didn't I didn't know I had company.
Hey, do you play checkers?
Yeah, I play checkers.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Everybody plays checkers.
Doesn't anybody drink anymore?
Hello, Dr. Bellows?
Major Healey?
Where have you and Major Nelson been?
In jail?
For a speeding ticket?
Major Healey, unlike outer space, there are speed limits on the ground which even astronauts are to obey.
In all my years of driving, I have never received a ticket.
And that is because I am cautious and defensive behind the wheel.
Not one ticket, major, in over 20 years.
An insurance fraud, eh?
All right.
Tell me where you are and I'll be out there for the trial.
Clarkston?
Where is that?
Never mind, I'll find it on the map.
See you at a quarter to 10:00, sir.
Right, sir.
We'll be waiting for you.
Major Healey, where is my master?
I'll be through in a minute, ma'am.
No, sir.
Just a woman waiting outside looking for her master.
Yes, sir.
In court.
See you in court.
Yes, sir, goodbye.
What are you doing here?
Where is my master, Major Healey?
I know he is in trouble.
I must know where he is.
I'll tell you anything you want, but that outfit This is a small town, the people can be stuffy.
In fact, I'm feeling a little stuffy myself.
I understand.
Something for a small town.
Even in that outfit Clarkston isn't ready for you.
We better get out of here.
Darling, we can't go on meeting this way.
Oh, master, forgive me for not getting here sooner.
What are you doing here?
What are you do?
Don't tell me, I know.
Bigmouth Roger.
Do not be angry with Major Healey, master.
He did not wish to tell me, but I threatened to turn him into a toad.
If he was any kind of friend he'd be sitting on a lily pad keeping his mouth shut.
I want you to go home.
Right now, immediately.
No, master, I will not go home without you.
It makes me cry to see you in a dirty old jail cell.
They'll never believe this at AA.
Jeannie Go home, and take everything with you.
Welcome home, master.
Well, you said everything.
Yeah, I didn't mean me.
Or him.
I hope this hallucination has a liquor cabinet.
Jeannie, you get us back in that cell right now.
But you're innocent.
I know it.
Yes, I know it too, but I got to prove it in court.
Now get us back there right away.
Nothing in there but a one room apartment.
Poor man.
Jeannie!
I'm doing it.
One thing at a time.
Jeannie For heaven's sakes, Jeannie!
Master, just because you have to be in jail for one day does not mean you cannot be comfortable.
Yeah, quit bugging her.
Just relax.
Jeannie, I want you to get everything out of here, except him and me.
Everything, everything.
I am not appreciated.
Boy, she sure takes you at your word, doesn't she?
Jeannie, the bars.
The bars, put back the bars!
That's what this country needs, more bars.
Jeannie.
Would you let me in, please.
Sorry, pal, I already got a roommate.
Mr. Cashman, this whole thing is a fraud.
You've got to get Tony out.
Tony, Tony.
This is your lawyer.
He is going to get you Out?
Let me in, let me in.
You city fellas sure do things different, don't you?
Norman, I demand my rights.
Would you ask the sheriff to stop putting me in here with drunks.
He's no drunk, Tommy.
That would be easy.
No, he's a hit-and-run driver.
I'll be lucky to get him off with five years.
This court will come to order.
Sit down.
We're going to take up the matter of the People v. Nelson.
Is the prosecution ready?
Ready, Your Honor.
Is the defense ready?
I protest, Your Honor.
This trial was scheduled for 10:00.
Why are we starting an hour earlier?
I'm sorry about that, son, but you see, Sam over there has to go crawdad fishing at 3.
But my lawyer and my material witness aren't here yet, sir.
Joe Joe!
Go get Norman out of bed.
I can't help your witness, son but don't fret about Norman.
He never was one for getting places on time.
What about Dr. Bellows?
He'll never make it now.
Oh, yeah.
Jeannie, come here.
Go find Dr. Bellows, speed him up.
Yes, master.
At once.
No!
Not that way.
Don't blink, just walk out normally.
Oh, yes, master.
Anything you say.
About time, Norman.
I'm sorry, Elroy.
Mildred's got a bug and I had to take the kids to school.
I haven't even had breakfast yet.
Hi, Sam.
Morning, Norm.
Morning, Thelma Suffering catfish, Edgar.
Is this what that city slicker did to you?
Your Honor, I object.
You can't object yet.
Trial ain't even started yet.
But he's supposed to be my lawyer.
Fella's right, Norman.
You can't go around showing partiality, you know.
Sorry, Elroy, I mean, Your Honor.
It's just that I had no idea.
Well, just go on over to your client.
Do I have to?
'Fraid so.
Disgrace.
Just disgrace.
Mr. Cashman, you're supposed to be defending me.
Relax, I'm always at my best when I got a really hopeless case.
Is the defense prepared?
What's your plan of action?
You'll see.
I got a couple of real slick legal maneuvers up my sleeve.
Good, good.
Watch this.
Your Honor, we plead guilty and throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.
Now wait a minute!
That's a slick maneuver, all right.
Now I want to be sure I understand you, young fella.
You want to dismiss Norman here?
Yes, sir.
I don't feel he has my best interests at heart.
Okay, Norman, you're relieved.
You can go home and have your breakfast now.
Thanks, Elroy.
Frankly, pal, I think you did right.
I never could beat Sam, over there.
Not since I married his sister, anyway.
Well, good luck, Edgar.
Thelma.
See you home for dinner, Sam.
Mildred's making a pot roast.
Well, son, that leaves you without a lawyer.
If it please the court, I'd like to represent myself.
Yes.
Now, one more disturbance like that and I'll clear the court.
Sam, let's get on with this.
Call your first witness.
What about Dr. Bellows?
He is coming, Master.
I did just what you said.
Good, good.
What'd I say?
You asked Jeannie to speed him up.
And that is exactly what I did.
Okay, now, Thelma, you tell us what you saw in your own words.
I'll try, Sam.
Just take your time, Thelma.
Thank you, Elroy.
That man there Call me Tony.
Sorry, Elroy.
Excuse me, Sam.
Go on, Thelma.
You making fun in my court, son?
No, Your Honor, I just felt left out.
You go on with your testifying, Thelma.
Well, Edgar and I were sitting in the front seat of the car  I see, yes.
If he sees, I'm going blind.
Okay now, Burt, you You tell us what you saw.
I seen exactly what Thelma did.
There you are, Elroy, a corroborating witness.
No further questions.
Well, I have some.
What exactly did you see?
Like I said, I seen what Thelma seen.
I didn't understand one word of what Thelma saw.
You better start paying attention, son.
You're on trial here, you know.
Your honor, I insist Look, I gotta go, Elroy.
Ain't nobody watching the highway.
You're excused, Burt.
Is that bad?
Ha!
Now, Major Healey we drove into the gasoline station We drove into this gasoline station And there was already a car there.
And there was another car already there.
Major Healey, would you wait until I phrase my question?
I will wait until you phrase the question.
Thank you.
Would you say I struck his car very hard with my car?
I'm sorry, I don't understand that.
Would you say that I struck his car very hard with my car?
You struck his car very hard with your car.
How hard did we strike his car?
We hit it?
He was driving.
All right.
How hard would you say I struck his car?
Oh, oh Just barely.
Good, good, now we're getting somewhere.
Then that poor devil over there starts screaming and crying and yelling, and then you said, "Let's get out of this burg".
Your Honor, I object.
You can't object.
He's your own witness.
I'm beginning to wonder.
If it please the court, may I treat Major Healy as a hostile witness?
Go right ahead, son.
Thank you, Your Honor.
No further questions.
You idiot!
Excuse me, if you'll excuse me, sir.
How was I?
Where is Dr. Bellows?
I do not know, master.
Shall I No, no.
Your Honor, may I request a recess until my medical witness arrives.
Request denied.
In that case, Your Honor, I'll have to change my plea to guilty.
There's only one person in this courtroom who could prove my innocence, and it's that man.
And he seems very conveniently prevented from testifying.
Edgar!
Oh, honey!
Edgar Are you all right?
Did you break anything?
No, I'm fine, thanks.
Your Honor, the defense rests.
Elroy, I swear I knew nothing about this sneaky little business here, and I intend to bring charges against Edgar here for attempted fraud.
Oh, knock it off, Sam.
We can't win them all.
Case dismissed.
You just couldn't wait, could you?
You just had to be a wheelchair hot rodder Something tells me he's really gonna need that wheelchair when she gets through with him.
It's really gonna be great to breathe free air again.
Free?
I still have to pay my hotel bill.
Let us go home, master.
I have prepared a great victory celebration.
No, no, Jeannie.
No celebrations.
I've had enough Major Nelson.
I don't know how to explain to you what happened.
I was driving along when all of a sudden the car went berserk.
Sure it did, colonel.
That car just up and took off by itself.
But that's exactly what happened.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Thanks, Jeannie, I'll be home early.
Oh, master, be careful.
Okay, I'm only gonna go down to the office.
Oh, yes, master, but next week, you will be going to the moon, and I wish to instill in you a careful attitude.
Okay, I promise I'll stop at all the red lights.
Oh, I'm sorry  Hey, what's the big idea?
You just kissed me goodbye inside.
Did I?
I forgot.
Did you?
Well, that's one thing about my kisses, they always leave a lasting impression.
Get inside.
Go on, go on.
Ooh!
Sister, you kissed my master and made him think it was me.
For the last time, sister, you leave my master alone.
He belongs to me.
Do you think I don't know that?
Here I am, madly in love with my own sister's master, knowing I could never have him.
And you begrudge me one measly little kiss.
Oh, there's no charity in you, sister.
Oh, I am sorry.
I did not think of it that way.
Oh, that's all right.
Forget it.
Did I hear you say he's thinking of going to the moon?
Oh, yes, sister, and I am so happy for him.
It is the one thing he wants in this whole world.
Hm.
Then he'd be furious with anyone who tried to stop him.
Hm?
I'm sorry, sister, I did not hear you.
I said, I think you should try to stop him.
Oh, no, sister, I would never think of doing that.
I want him to do whatever will make him happy.
Well, that's the difference between us.
You would let him go into unchartered space, facing all sorts of unknown dangers.
While I, I would keep him at home.
Safe, protected.
Hm.
But, then, he's your master.
Do you really think it is that dangerous?
The first man on the moon?
Are you kidding?
Why, his chances are only vech in vechnachi of coming back alive.
Vech in vechnachi?
Oh, dear.
Well, I wouldn't want to try to To influence you, sister, but if I were you, I'd convince him to stay home.
You are right.
I will try.
Oh, and, sis, I wouldn't mention that you talked to me.
Well, you know how he feels about me.
He's liable to misunderstand my motives.
Oh, I understand.
I will not say anything.
And I forgive you for kissing him.
I had better go.
Goodbye.
Hmm.
Oh, dear.
Once a sucker, always a sucker.
Now, gentlemen, if you'll notice on the left is the crater Langrenus.
The landing site section has discarded that because of its depth.
And the same goes for the, uh, crater Copernicus.
Uh, that leaves us with the choice of three: The Sea of Storms, the Sea of Showers or the Sea of Tranquility.
Excuse me, just a moment.
Go home.
Go home.
Major Nelson, whatever it is, can't it wait?
I'll have to consider this later, miss.
Uh, please, later.
Please, master, it is urgent.
Later.
Major Nelson.
Ahem.
This one's mine.
Uh, I'm Major Healey.
Would you like to tell me your troubles and telephone number?
Hm?
Oh, J Would you get out of here?
But But I have to talk to him.
Out.
Out.
What was that last name?
Uh, Miss Miss Miss Waff.
Proceed, major.
Yes, sir, of course.
As I was saying, we have a choice between Storms, Showers and Tranquility.
Yes.
Since our lowest orbital point will be over the crater Tycho, uh, the best landing site would seem to be, um, "Do not go to the moon.
It is too dangerous".
What was that, major?
He said, "Do not go to the moon.
It's too dangerous".
Could you speak up a little, Tony?
Can't hear you.
That's what I heard, major.
No, sir, I believe you understood me to say Tycho is too dangerous.
Oh.
Could've fooled me.
It did not work, sister.
He was showing movies of the moon, and I could not even talk to him.
Oh.
That poor, brave fool.
He doesn't realize what dangers there are.
Listen to this, listen to this: "The moon-bound astronauts can expect searing heat, sub-zero cold, dust craters miles deep".
Oh, that is terrible.
Well, I will talk to him again when he gets home.
Hm.
I'm beginning to wonder how much you love him, sis.
If it were me, I wouldn't waste a minute.
But I cannot see him now, he is with Dr. Bellows and a general.
Sis, what's more important?
Embarrassing him a little or saving his life?
What do you think I should do?
Just leave it up to me, darling.
You're long on devotion, but short on ingenuity.
No.
I am sorry, sister, but I still do not trust you alone with my master.
What "alone"?
You just said he's with Dr. Bellows and a general.
Well, that is true.
What are you going to do?
Mm.
I just want to show him how dangerous the moon really is.
May I borrow your little soldier suit?
What?
Hm-hm.
Oh.
Oh, certainly.
So the consensus from all sections seems to point at the Sea of Tranquility.
Specifically this little declivity here, which you'll be able to see more clearly on the blown-up stills.
Major Nelson, what's the matter with you?
"What's the matter with"?
Couldn't you see?
It was nothing, sir, I thought I saw something peculiar in the Sea of Tranquility.
And it made you yell?
Doctor, is he in shape to make this flight?
I'm beginning to wonder about that myself.
Can we continue this this afternoon?
I have a little business I'd like to attend to.
You certainly do, major, in my office.
I'm booked up solid this afternoon.
We'll have to finish now.
That is, if you can continue without going into a fit.
Well, as I was saying, um, this little I think you'll notice this little declivity on the edge of the Sea of Tranquility.
What is it this time, major?
Something else peculiar?
He's going to pieces.
Well, proceed, major.
I'm I'm all right, sir.
The Sea of Tranquility is definitely the landing site!
Wait a minute, you don't have to yell, we can hear you.
Boy Was I shouting?
!
Sorry!
You're still shouting.
Sorry!
Precisely 0600 on the third day, the landing module will descend into a 50-yard target perimeter!
Doctor, will you look at that?
I can't.
The sight of a fine specimen like Major Nelson cracking up before my very eyes is more than I can bear.
On the northeast edge of The Sea of Tranquility This is the good part.
I don't know what Jeannie's trying to do but I gotta stop her before Dr. Bellows is convinced I'm completely off my rocker.
Yeah, you're supposed to be in his office right now.
Yeah.
Oh, no you don't, major, baby.
I'm not through helping you yet.
Hello?
I am sorry, we are unable to complete your call.
Please deposit 15 cents for the first three minutes.
Oh, yes, just a moment.
Roger, give me 15 cents.
What do you 15 cents for?
Just give me 15 cents.
Miss, this is not a payphone.
Then kindly move to a payphone and deposit 15 cents for the first three minutes.
No, you don't understand.
You must've made a mistake.
This is not a payphone.
Now, would you put my call through, please?
I am sorry, we are not allowed to engage in personal arguments with the customers.
This is a recording.
Yeah, but wait a minute, wait a minute.
I just had a fight with a recording.
Fifteen cents, huh.
Major Nelson.
Yes?
I asked you to go to my office from the screening room.
Take it easy, sir, he's feeling a little shaky.
I am not feeling I'm not feeling shaky.
I just dropped by my office to pick up papers before Well, of course you're not feeling shaky.
Of course not.
Now, come along, we're gonna have a little examination and it'll be over just like that.
What's the matter, major?
Huh?
Oh, the The thunder startled me, sir.
You hear the thunder, Roge?
No, I'm still working out the 15 cents for the phone call.
Thunder?
Well, there's not a cloud in the sky.
What's the matter?
Did you hear it again?
Uh, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm fine, sir.
Just fine.
Everything's fine.
Oh.
Well, just relax.
He's feeling better already.
Better, major?
He's a wreck.
I never saw a man go to pieces so quickly, and it happened like Don't, don't, don't.
What's wrong?
He was just gonna snap his fingers like this.
Oh!
Here, here.
Well, the diagnosis is just a clear case of nervous disintegration.
What's the matter?
Excuse me, but I'm sorry, I'll have to inform General Schaeffer.
Well, they won't put you through unless you have 15 cents.
What?
Fifteen cents.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
What's the matter with me anyhow?
General?
Oh, it It pains me to say this but, uh, I'm afraid we'll have to replace Major Nelson on the moon shot.
Sir, if you just give me a couple hours sleep, I could go home, I'd feel fine in the morning, really, I would.
Yes, general.
Oh.
Wait.
Wait.
Tell me what to do.
Easy.
No, no, no, easy.
Easy.
My master is really not going to the moon?
The way he's been acting, darling, not a chance.
I hope we are doing the right thing.
Oh, don't bother to thank me, darling, it was a labor of love.
Oh, but I do appreciate your help.
My goodness, I never would've had the courage to do it myself.
Just remember, darling, no matter what he says, it's for his own good.
Oh.
There he is.
Oh, dear, I hope he is not too angry.
Well, uh, don't tell him I had anything to do with it.
I don't want any credit.
But he should know what a favor you have done him.
No!
No, no, you see, darling, I'm I'm not even supposed to be here.
My goodness, if my real master found out, he'd kill me.
Oh.
And you came here just to help me.
You know, sister, I never realized what a really good friend you are.
Yes, well, goodbye, sucker.
I mean Sister.
Sister.
It is for your own good.
It is for your own good.
Oh, thanks, thanks a lot.
But It is for your own good.
I'm not going to the moon.
They've replaced me.
Yes, master, for your own good.
The General thinks I'm a ding-a-ling.
They might put me in the statistics section.
Yes, master, for your own good.
Don't say that again!
Sorry, this time you've gone too far.
It's over, finished.
Ha-ha.
That's it, baby, victory.
How could you do this to me?
Ever since I got in the Air Force, I've been dreaming of making a moon shot and why But, master, it was for your own Don't you ever say that again.
Not ever.
Ever.
Well, it is too dangerous.
You're protecting me now.
Okay.
Do not thank me, master, it was a labor of love.
Huh?
Well, I appreciate your concern, but understand that I can't go on with this anymore.
Oh, no, master, you must understand.
If you land on the moon, you must expect searing heat, freezing cold, dust craters Jeannie, please.
Your chances of coming back alive are only vech in vechnachi.
Vech and vechnachi?
That is Persian for one in a 1000.
Jeannie, don't you understand?
Everything you're thinking of, all the dangers and everything, that NASA has taken these into account.
Oh, yes, master, but they're only mortals, I am It's called "technology".
Technology.
Technology?
Mm-hm.
Is that a new kind of magic?
Jeannie, will you help me?
Please?
Well, I do not know.
Please?
Please, help me.
May I blink you an extra pair of long underwear?
Yeah, two if you want.
And will you promise not to step in any dust craters?
I promise, cross my heart.
All right, I will help you.
Good.
Let's go.
Can you get everything straight?
Oh, yes, master.
Everything's under control.
I'll be with you later, sergeant, I have this experiment to do.
Now, were you ready, major?
Yes, sir, quite ready.
Good.
All right.
Here we go.
Extraordinary.
Absolutely extraordinary.
Why, it's the most remarkable recovery I've ever seen.
You've been sitting there for two hours.
Well, you must have nerves of steel, major.
Hello, Dr. Bellows, are you listening to records?
Records?
Don't be ridiculous.
Here, you've got to hear this.
You've got to hear this experiment.
Wait a minute.
Alrighty.
Now, listen intently.
Major.
Major.
Major, I want you to go and get General Schaeffer.
I want him to hear this.
Major Healey.
Oh, never mind.
Oh!
You were wonderful, master.
I was, wasn't I?
Well.
It's a little dumpy.
Like my sister.
Well, now that I'm finally rid of her, I can fix this place up.
Ah!
Whoa.
Ha-ha!
Oh, hello, sister.
Uh, what is this doing here?
A little present.
What are you doing here?
Why should I not be here?
This is my home.
Oh, yes, yes, but But didn't he throw you out when you had him replaced on the moon flight?
Oh, that.
Well, he was not replaced after all.
You see, my master explained to me that NASA has a new kind of magic that takes care of all the dangers in outer space Ha.
A new kind of magic.
Hm.
It is called technology.
Oh, brother.
And so you fixed everything up?
Yes, and my master is leaving in two days.
Is that not wonderful?
Oh, scrumptious.
Well, I better be going.
I have my work cut out for me.
Oh, sister, why do you not stay for a few days?
Oh, no, sis, thank you, I don't want to put you out.
You would not be putting me out.
Oh, yes, I will.
Ta-ta.
What'd she mean by that?
Yes, I'll have that information for you immediately.
Well, gentlemen, there's one new detail.
That was the propulsion section.
There's been a change in the weight displacement ratio in the capsule.
Instead of the usual 50 pounds leeway, we now have 20.
Well, there goes my lucky paperweight.
They want our last-minute weight figures.
Well, that shouldn't be any problem.
I don't think we could've gained weight this last week.
Well, speak for yourself, I had a pretty big breakfast.
Well, gentlemen, shall we go?
Yes, sir.
A hundred and Wait.
Hold it, sir.
Here, take this.
A hundred and seventy-five.
Right on the nose.
Yes, right on the nose, a hundred and seventy-five, no change there.
Uh, Major Nelson?
Yes.
Last chance, baby, better make it good.
Ooh.
It'll be a hundred and eighty-one and a quarter, sir.
Oops.
Excuse me.
Yeah.
Uh Major Nelson.
Yes, I'm sorry.
If you fidget, the scale won't register properly.
Yes.
A hundred and ninety.
Oh, Major, you gained 10 pounds since the last weigh-in.
I couldn't weigh 190, sir.
The scale must be broken.
No, it's not, it worked perfect for me.
Roger.
Well, even if it's correct, the situation isn't critical.
You still have 10 pounds leeway.
Oh, good.
Let me see if it's broken.
Roge, it's all right.
On second though, major, let's try it again.
Yes, let's try it.
Two hundred and five?
Why, Major, you're over the limit.
Well, if I gained 20 pounds, obviously, it would show, wouldn't it, sir?
Well, that's true.
Could I get weighed on another scale?
Yes, in my office.
Come along as soon as you can.
Yes, sir.
Better lay off the sweets.
Two hundred and five pounds.
Shame, shame, shame.
How much do you weigh, Dr. Bellows?
Uh, what?
No matter which scale you use, it will register the same.
What do you think you're doing?
I thought I explained it to you.
Well, I have changed my mind.
It is much too dangerous for you.
I will not let you go.
Look, I don't have time to go into this.
I'm your master and I order you to undo whatever you've done.
Oh, please do not order me.
Well, I'm your master and I order you now.
Now.
Oh, I wish I were not such an obedient genie.
Oh, brother.
Here, take this, and it will put your weight back to normal.
Are you sure?
Mm-hm.
What've you done to me?
I'm enormous.
I am sorry, master, but it is for your own good.
Now, wait a minute.
You will thank me when it is all over.
I'll thank you?
Yeah, I'll thank you.
Jeannie, please be nice.
I can't understand what's taking him so long.
He's the one who insisted the scale was wrong.
Well, he always was a slow dresser.
Major Nelson!
What happened?
You really put on a few.
Yeah.
Well, sir, something weird happened with my m Metabolic rate.
Just give me a little time in the lab.
A couple of hours.
Couple of hours?
Why, it'll take you at least a year to get back to normal.
May I sit down, please, sir?
If you can.
Come over here.
Here.
Thank you.
Sit.
Yeah.
Well, I Oh, no!
Oh!
Easy, now.
Easy.
Get him up.
Major Healey, can't you try?
Oh, he's heavy, heavy, heavy.
Hey, haven't you ever heard about the Air Force Diet?
There's no question of you going on the moon shot.
The capsule would never get off the ground.
Sir, this is just temporary.
If you give me a little time Back into the examination room and stay there, major.
General Schaeffer will want to see this.
Oh.
Jeannie's done it this time.
She's done it this time.
I'm finished, I'm washed up.
Whoa!
Oh.
Examination room's over here, Tony.
Whoa, it's It's.
Whoa.
Well, it's shocking, Major Nelson, absolutely shocking.
I mean, I knew my sister was dumb, but I had no idea she was that dumb.
I put up with this for a long time, but this time, we've had it.
I'm through.
Through, absolutely through.
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Poor sis.
But I can't say I blame you.
Say, if you're in the market for a master, maybe we could work a little something out, huh?
Mm.
I thought you'd never ask.
Kiss me.
Uh, w No, not now.
Would you blink me skinny?
I can't go around kissing you like this.
You've got a point.
Oh, that's better.
Mm.
Got ya!
Oh!
What is?
No, her eyes, you idiot!
Get her in the closet.
I don't want to go in with her.
You won't believe it, sir, but he must weight at least 300 pounds.
What happened to the door?
That's what I've been trying to tell you, general.
He couldn't get through it.
Oh, hello, sir.
Who weighs 300 pounds?
Major Nelson, you're You're skinny.
Oh, well, thank you very much, sir.
Perhaps I should go on a weight-gaining diet?
Don't be ridiculous, not 10 minutes ago, you were gargantuan.
Dr. Bellows.
Well, he was, sir.
The first time he stepped on the scale, he was 10 pounds overweight.
And the next time he stepped on the scale, he was 20 pounds overweight.
What scale is that, sir?
Why, the scale right Dr. Bellows, I think you and I had better have a little talk.
Oh, not with me, with him, sir.
He's the one who's gaining and losing hundreds of pounds.
First you tell me that Major Nelson has had a complete nervous collapse.
Then you tell me he's made a remarkable recovery.
Then you tell me that he weighs 300 pounds!
And now I find him looking exactly like he always does.
What exactly have you against Major Nelson, doctor?
Nothing, General Schaeffer.
It's only that I'm trying Come on out, Roge.
Come on.
Roger.
Shh.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
I gotta lay off that space candy.
Ten minutes to capsule entry, doctor.
Thank you, Tom.
Well, major, everything's fine, except for a slight rise in pulse rate.
We can put that down to pre-blast-off excitement.
I've been waiting a number of years for a lunar orbit.
I guess I am excited.
Commander, if you will.
Well, now, let's see what we have here, Major Healey.
Ah, 175 pounds.
Good.
Dr. Bellows, I wanted to ask you a favor in case the splashdown is delayed.
Would you mind calling the Surf Restaurant and having them hold the table for me?
Uh, we're having a little party after the flight and I beg your pardon.
We're having a party and they get testy about reservations Major Healey, as command pilot, I insist you keep your mind on what's ahead.
Yes, sir.
Of course.
Relax, commander.
I'm sure when Major Healey is aloft, he'll tend to business.
Yeah.
After all, the moon's pretty romantic.
Had a lot of things written about it, poetry, music.
All bushwa.
The moon is a dead satellite composed of igneo-ferrous rock.
There is no plant life, no animal life, nothing.
It's just a field for scientific experiment and that's all.
Wingate's gonna be a lot of laughs on the moon.
Well, gentlemen, as far as I'm concerned, it's all systems go.
The only problem is the flu epidemic.
Of course, you've all been inoculated for the Asian flu, the Hong Kong flu, as a matter of fact, every kind of flu that we have a vaccine for.
Well, the rest is up to you.
Good luck, commander, major.
About the Surf Restaurant, sir.
Would you mind calling Master.
Psst.
Jeannie, I'm gonna blast off any second now.
I know.
Major Nelson, are you coming?
I'll be right there, sir.
But I had to give you one last-minute goodbye kiss.
Y Mm.
Oh.
Good luck.
Good luck.
And say hello to the man in the moon for me.
Jeannie, there's no man in the moon.
Well, of course there is.
Everyone says so.
Nelson.
Nelson, let's go.
I'll be right there, sir.
Yes.
Oh, my goodness.
I hope I am not coming down with something.
Tony, I've reported your cold to Mission Control.
They say it's up to me whether we abort or not.
Well, sir.
We've come this far.
Might as well go all the way.
Listen, we're 10 minutes away from lunar injection.
After that, it'll be too late.
Yeah, I'd hate to ask my doctor to make a house call on the moon.
Space humor there, commander.
It'll be a fun trip.
This is Nelson to Mission Control.
Translunar insertion in 60 seconds.
After that we'll be on radio and TV silence.
I wanna take this opportunity on behalf of Commander Wingate and Major Healey to thank all the ground crew for making this moment possible.
Sorry.
Oh, dear.
This is terrible.
My master cannot go to the moon when he has a cold.
He must be home where I can nurse him.
This is Nelson, over and out.
How was the walk, Wingate?
Exactly as I expected.
You must remember, Nelson, I have been here before.
Yes, of course.
Stand by for translunar insertion.
Give me a countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one, zero.
Lunar orbit, here we come.
Ah.
Right on the button, Wingate.
Oh, now we can relax for the next seven hours.
There, there, master.
Now, you can go to the moon next week, when you feel better.
Oh, dear.
Where am I?
I brought back the wrong astronaut.
Steady, steady, steady, steady, Wingate.
Uh They talk about raptures of the deep.
And, um, maybe you're having raptures of deep space.
Um Major Healey, take over and wake Major Nelson.
I seem to be having some kind of hallucination.
No, no, commander, this is no hallucination.
I simply made a mistake.
Oh.
Goodness.
Maybe my cold is affecting my powers.
Um, ahem, this is This is, uh This is incredible, Healey, but at this moment you appear to me as a, um A very beautiful woman wearing a, uh A, uh A harem costume.
Well, thank you.
It's my pleasure, Healey.
Oh, do not worry, commander.
I will put you back on your spacecraft.
And I will bring my master here.
Uh, no, no, I had better not.
If I should miss, you would be floundering out in space for ever and ever.
I know.
I know.
I will bring my master here.
I will try for him one more time Oh, he is so brilliant.
He is so brilliant.
He will know exactly what to do.
Well, now what do we do?
There's nothing to do.
We can't change course until we enter the lunar orbit.
Besides, we're gonna be on radio silence for next seven hours.
There's nothing to do but wait.
Oh, I wonder what Wingate is gonna think of Jeannie.
Major Healey, I'm gonna take a sleeping pill and maybe when I wake up, you'll be yourself again.
I mean, I'll be myself again, whatever.
Oh, master, oh, master, thank heaven.
I was so afraid that my cold had affected my blink.
Your blink's pretty rusty all right.
Blink us back in the capsule immediately.
Ah, oh, Nelson, Nelson, good, good.
I, uh I seem to be coming out of it.
You, uh You look like you should.
But, um, I wish you'd stop kissing Major Healey.
Now, please.
I cannot, master.
I must talk to you first.
Well, would you put him to sleep or something.
Oh, there is no need, master.
He took a sleeping pill.
Why did you do this?
That is why.
You see, master.
You know better than to go out of the house when you have a cold.
Jeannie, NASA's been preparing for this flight for three years, spending millions of dollars and you blink me back just 'cause I have a cold?
How about Wingate?
He didn't even have a cold.
Oh, well, I was aiming for you.
Well, you see, with my cold, my My eyes are all teary and my nose is plugged up, and I I missed.
Well, blow your nose and blink us back.
Oh, master, I could not do that.
It would be too dangerous.
Oh, I might miss and And And miss that tiny little capsule and you'd be floundering in space for ever and ever.
Oh, Jeannie.
I am sorry, master.
Don't you understand It is all my fault.
Roger is up there all alone.
It takes two people to operate that thing.
He can't possibly complete the mission.
Oh, that is all right, master.
I will go up there and help him.
You What?
You can't go up there.
You don't know the first thing about it.
Of course I can, master.
It is the only way to fly.
You're kidding.
You can't Jeannie!
Jeannie, come back.
Ah!
Master, be sure and get plenty of rest, eat lightly and push fluids.
What?
Oh, wait a minute, you can't It occurs to me Nelson?
You want lonely, I'll give you lonely.
Hello, Major Healey.
What is this, Grand Central Station?
I do not think so.
Where's Tony and Commander Wingate?
They're at home.
I am supposed to help you complete your mission.
Great.
The boys on Yorktown are in for a surprise when they pick us up.
Shh.
Don't wake up.
Here.
Up, up, up.
Shh.
Major, take a note.
Feeling of weightlessness is very pronounced.
Weightlessness, yeah.
This is a marvelous idea, Amanda, throwing a surprise, welcome-home party for Major Nelson.
I can't wait to see the look on his face.
Oh, me too, sweetheart.
Put those things in the kitchen and I think I'll start in here.
Wait a minute, I'm gonna need a red.
Give me a white while you're there.
Oh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Shh!
What's happening?
I feel like I'm on somebody's shoulder.
Yeah, weird, isn't it?
Commander, release the attitude control.
Attitude control released.
Oh, pretty.
Darling, hand me a white.
Is there white?
Ah, here we are.
Thank you.
Hey, good job.
Alfred, is there anybody here?
Not as far as I know.
Um, so how come I just saw the garage doors close?
What?
Yes, Alfred.
When we drove up, the garage doors were open and I just saw them close.
Right now.
Thieves?
You think so?
Let's take a look.
Where are we?
Huh?
We're in deep space, sir.
Where else would we be?
I was having hallucinations.
I must still be having them.
This place looks like a garage.
Ah!
Someone's out th Shh.
I was just trying Testing the retro rocket, sir.
Everything's gonna be fine.
We're in deep space.
You're just having a very weird reaction.
Alfred, darling, I tell you.
There is someone in here.
All right, Amanda.
Let's find out.
Hold it.
Don't be so excited.
Just try to go back to sleep.
I am sorry I ruined everything, Major Healey.
Please do not be angry.
I'm not angry.
It takes three men to run a capsule.
I got one genie, one guy.
If I had two genies, maybe, and one guy.
Or two guys and one genie.
Major, I Shh.
What's happening?
It must be stuck.
What are you doing?
Wait!
My tie!
Shh!
Alfred.
What is it, Alfred?
Ah, Amanda.
Heaven help me.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I never heard of such things.
Alfred, I'm very sorry.
Amanda, the door was locked because obviously Major Nelson wanted it locked.
He wanted to keep people out and that includes us.
How could he lock it because Now, look, honey, let's go back to the decorating.
I've got to back at the base when they break radio silence.
All right, dear, but I Now, look, Amanda, I have never heard of What's going on here?
That was Dr. Bellows' voice.
I'd recognize it anywhere.
You're endangering the whole mission, sir.
You know what I think?
I think that I must have blacked out in the capsule.
You aborted the mission and for some strange reason you're trying to convince me that I'm still up there.
Sir, listen to me.
Get a grip on yourself.
What's the last thing you remember before you blacked out?
Ah, I was in a bedroom.
Yeah.
And there was a girl there.
Yeah.
And she was wearing an Arabian harem costume.
Does that sound like a man in complete control of his faculties?
Well, no, I'm Well, I must admit But this is a garage.
I can see it.
Y-You want proof, sir?
Here, watch.
Look.
Look down.
Fantastic.
It looks close enough to touch.
Yeah, and yet we're thousands and thousands of miles away.
I can see the whole Atlantic Ocean.
As a matter of fact, it says "Atlantic Ocean".
Turbulence.
Jeannie, please try to get the commander and Tony back.
Oh, no, I'm sorry, Major Healey.
I cannot risk it.
I can't fly this thing by myself.
Oh, Major Healey, have patience.
Patience, patience.
Now, I know what a moon is.
Now, all you have to do is tell me what an orbit is, and I will get you one.
Tell you what an orbit Okay.
Start at the beginning.
Now, look, Amanda, we have to go.
They break radio silence in 20 minutes.
Darling, why don't you go on by yourself and, uh, I'll stay here and finish decorating, and I can watch it on the major's television set.
All right, if you insist.
Okay, darling.
Bye.
Bye.
I've gotta get to NASA.
That's the only way I can get in touch with Jeannie.
Sir, please, wake up.
Sir.
Helmet.
My helmet.
I feel naked without my helmet.
Helmet?
I'll get you a helmet.
Don't worry.
Stay there.
Nelson, what's going on?
Everything's all right, sir.
Just fine.
Major Nelson, is that you?
Who's that?
Who's that?
Oh, don't be silly, Amanda.
He's on his way to the moon.
Major Nelson, that is What are you doing here?
That was Major Nelson.
I'm gonna have to go to NASA and tell Alfred about this.
For heaven's sake.
All right, Jeannie, ready?
Ready.
Okay, now.
Did I do right, Major Healey?
Do you know where we're headed?
Mars.
Mars!
What went wrong?
I don't know, sir.
Incredible.
The yellow lever, before it's too late!
Yellow lever.
Which way, Major Healey?
Starboard until I tell you to stop.
Starboard.
Is starboard up or down?
Is starboard up or down?
Oh, I didn't wanna go to the moon anyway.
Major Healey, I can see the moon.
Perhaps if I blinked.
How are they doing now?
It's all right.
Sir.
They're back on course.
Major Nelson, you come back here.
You come back here this instant.
You're supposed to be on your way to the moon.
Major, you come out of there.
A heck of a way to end your career, trapped in a men's room.
Major!
You're supposed to be on your way to the moon.
I knew I saw him at his house.
Now Alfred's gonna see you too.
Major Nelson, you come out of there.
Do you hear me, Major Nelson?
Oh, airman, you come right here and you stand right there and guard that door.
And don't you let a soul out of there.
You hear me?
Excuse me, ma'am, but I can't take orders from you.
Well, of course you can.
I'm a colonel's wife.
Alfred!
Alfred!
General, general, come quick.
I have Major Nelson trapped in the men's room.
I beg your pardon, Mrs. Bellows.
He's in the men's room.
And I think he's got Commander Wingate with him.
Amanda, please, what's the matter with you.
Commander Wingate and Major Nelson are in Apollo 14 on their way to the moon.
That's what they want you to think, but they're in the men's room.
And I have an airman guarding the door.
Doctor, get her out of here.
Amanda, please, calm down.
Alfred, I saw him.
I s  Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'm not supposed to let anybody come out of there.
Yeah, yeah.
Say, aren't you Major Nelson?
You got the major part right, boy, but Major Nelson's on his way to the moon.
Yes, sir, I know, but Who told you to guard this door, anyway?
Oh, uh, it was a colonel's wife, sir.
A colonel's wife.
Yes, sir.
Sufferin' catfish, what's this Air Force coming to?
I'm gonna give you another order, boy.
Stand guard this door, Don't let anybody in.
You understand?
Yes, sir.
How am I gonna talk to Jeannie without three million people seeing me?
Alfred, you've got to believe me, I saw him.
Now, Amanda, why don't you go into my office and lie down.
I'll be with you just as soon as I can.
Ugh.
Agh.
Major, w-would you mind coming into the next room and showing yourself to my husband?
I can't.
You can't?
I'm not here.
You're not here?
Alfred, Alfred, Major Nelson!
Everybody come!
He's out here!
He went over there.
Over there, come on!
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Apollo 14, Apollo 14, come in, please.
Jeannie!
Oh, yes, master.
I can hear you.
But I cannot see you.
Blink me back up there, please.
Oh, but, master, I'm not sure if it would work.
Jeannie, blink me back up there, now.
Now!
Alfred.
Come on, come on.
He's right over here.
He's right over Where?
Well, he was right here.
Now, Amanda, this is going to stop.
He was right here, now he's gone.
Ridiculous.
He was here.
Oh, master, I made it.
I did it.
I did it.
I was successful.
Wait, wait a minute.
Don't be so happy.
Get Wingate up here.
Oh, instantly, master.
Right now.
Oh.
Oh.
Healey.
Healey, Nelson Listen, you won't believe the dream I've been having.
Oh, yes, I will.
Happy landings everybody.
Thank you.
This is Nelson to Mission Control.
We're about to pass behind the moon.
That's Apollo 14 over and out.
So listen, now, at first I thought I was in a bedroom.
And there was a girl there in a harem outfit.
And then I thought I was in a garage.
Yeah, well, if I were you, I'd keep that dream to myself.
Oh, but We wouldn't want Dr. Bellows to think you had one trip too many.
Oh, no, no, no, it's very valuable scientific research.
No, no, no, that's liable to get you grounded.
Tony and I didn't have the dream.
Yeah, that's right.
Did you have the dream?
You alone.
Amanda, I never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my life.
Alfred, I'm telling you that I saw him.
He was He was wearing a gardener's uniform and he was pushing a man in a garbage can.
And the man in the garbage can had a big globe on his head.
The man had a big globe on his head?
You know, Amanda, you are amazing.
You're a psychiatrist's wife and you don't Will you get rid of that?
I'll get rid of it.
You're the most gullible person.
What, darling, I can't hear you.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Now, come on.
I'm asking you.
This is your old friend, Roger, remember?
I'm not asking for much.
I still don't see why you need me.
Because I've been trying to date this girl for two months.
I mean, funny lines in the hall, flowers, candy and everything.
And she just won't go out with me.
Perhaps she does not trust you.
Yeah.
Sharp.
Funny.
Listen, I told her we would double date at the opening of the new Cocoa Beach Cabana.
And she said she would go.
Now, come on.
You can't let me down.
Oh, please, master, may we go?
I have never been to the opening of a nightclub, and it would be such fun.
No, Jeannie.
You know I hate nightclubs.
They're noisy, and they're expensive and dark.
Huh.
I I could have sworn there was somebody back there.
It was probably a reflection.
Now, come on.
How about it?
Why me?
Why can't you double date with somebody else?
Because she knows you.
She thinks you're respectable and responsible.
And when it's over, with Jeannie you can blink out and leave the two of us alone, hmm-hmm.
I swear there's Master, what is wrong?
There was somebody behind those drapes.
Oh, master, you are imagining things.
Oh, please, may we go with Major Healey?
Yes.
Oh!
Oh, you're gonna make a beautiful girl very happy.
But not until Saturday night.
Saturday night.
You won't forget this.
I won't forget this.
Oh, master, I am so excited.
I'm so excited.
Just think, we are going to a nightclub together.
A nightclub!
Oh, my goodness.
I I must go immediately to Paris and select my gown.
Ooh!
It certainly doesn't take much to make her happy.
Saturday night.
That gives me almost a week to plan.
Oh, darling Major Nelson.
Let me see.
So far, I've tried to get you by kidnapping you, putting you in a birdcage, roasting you alive and deep-freezing you.
All right.
This time no more Mr. Nice Guy.
Yes.
Thank you very much, major.
Come in.
Dr. Bellows.
Yes, may I help you?
I sincerely hope so, darling.
My, they didn't tell me you were so handsome.
Uh, I don't believe we've met, Miss uh Jones, darling.
Ah.
I have a proposition for you.
I'm a married man, Miss Jones.
Oh, not that kind of proposition, silly.
How would you like to have Miss Bonnie Greer entertain for the boys here at NASA.
Bonnie Greer, the singer who's opening at the Cocoa Beach Cabana?
Yes, darling.
I think I can arrange it.
I am her manager.
And I'm sure she'd be happy to entertain for the boys here if you can get enough of the brass to come to her opening tonight.
Oh, that would be very nice.
We'd love to have her.
Ah, good, good, good.
Here are two tickets.
Thank you.
Now, you come tonight and applaud real good and loud, and I'm sure everything will work out.
Oh, uh, by the way, Major Nelson and Major Healey are coming tonight too.
You could make a party of it.
Uh, thank you, Miss Jones.
Um, will we see you tonight?
Oh, you certainly will, darling.
Phase one.
Now for phase two, which is letting nature take its course.
What do you need me for?
Look, anyway, I've gotta pick up Betty at 9:00.
Roger, uh, you were the one who bludgeoned me into this in this first place.
At least you can stick around and give me some moral support when I have to tell Jeannie she can't go.
Jeannie, I'd, uh, like to have a word with you.
One minute, master.
Come on, I gotta get out of here and change.
Relax, relax.
Jeannie will change you.
Yeah, you realize what she's gonna change us into when she finds out we're not taking her?
I am ready, master.
Oh, wow.
Hey, look at that.
I'll tell you what, you take Betty, and I'll stay home with Jeannie.
Do you like it, master?
Oh, it's It's just beautiful.
Well, it's a little late, folks, so good night.
I thought I would choose a green gown I have bad news.
but then I remembered, my master likes white Dr. Bellows called.
And so I picked this gown.
I'm afraid you can't go.
It has a little gold What did you say, master?
Well, uh, I'm afraid you can't go, Jeannie.
Dr. Bellows called and And he's going to the nightclub tonight, and Well, I just I couldn't I have taken three days in Paris to pick out this gown.
Yeah, I know.
I have spent all afternoon upstairs getting ready.
All afternoon.
I know that And now you stand there and tell me I can't go?
I Well, why don't you say something?
What he's trying to say is that there's gonna be a lot of people there, and he doesn't want to be seen with you.
Yeah, that's right.
No!
I don't Thanks, I needed that.
Thanks a lot.
I better go and get dressed.
Yeah, Jeannie, just try to listen to me, will you?
I'm awfully sorry about this Three days.
Three days it took me to pick out this gown.
I know, and it's a beautiful And I did my hair.
Specially, I did my hair.
Yeah?
With my own two hands.
And it looks it.
Oh!
No, I didn't mean it that way.
Please try to Oh, master, please, do not say one more word.
I am so angry.
Okay, okay.
I am so angry I could Don't get angry.
I could No, now, don't.
I could Whatever it is, don't.
No!
Oh!
Please.
Look, tomorrow, I'll take you anyplace in the world you want to go.
Phase two.
Nature took its course nicely.
Me?
Please, please.
Please, please don't stop.
Ladies and gentlemen, such a pleasure to be here in Florida.
My wife did all the driving in, uh, Florida, from California.
And I must tell you, going around these mountain curves and the highways, she was wonderful, because she drives this way normally.
My wife gets a Will you laugh it up, please?
Some new people are coming in.
Coming in by the hundreds, four at a time.
Cheer up, sir.
This is a nightclub.
Come on.
I laughed when you came in.
What did you do?
Park your satellite outside?
Okay, now, if you're gonna buy a new car, take my advice: Don't take the wife with you, because the salesmen are very sharp.
Is this the young lady who's old enough to drive?
Who are you?
Well, I'm you understudy, darling.
I don't have an understudy.
Oh, yes, you do.
And you're going to need one too.
You see?
I told you.
You have laryngitis.
Hm.
And a temporary loss of consciousness too.
Now, don't be a sissy about it, darling.
You're going to be all right tomorrow.
I really am sorry about this, darling, but you see, I have to convince a certain major that a certain genie has flipped her lid.
Mi Mi, mi Mi  She wears a miniskirt with orthopedic shoes.
On her last birthday cake there were 48 candles on a slice I had.
What was wrong with that joke?
I know what you're thinking.
Why does he tell gags about his wife?
All comedians tells jokes about their wives.
But in spite of these jokes, I would like you to know I've been married for 28 years.
And personally, I don't see any humor in it.
Oh, dear me.
See, that's not a bad record, is it?
Considering we live out there in Hollywood, California.
Our neighbor's divorced and separated.
Many times I'll look at my wife and I'll say, "Where did we fail"?
It's the kind of a neighborhood one kid says to another, "My daddy can lick your daddy".
The other kid says, "Don't be an idiot.
Your daddy is my daddy".
Why, there's one kid on my block got an award for bringing the most parents to the PTA meeting.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have an unfortunate announcement to make.
A few minutes ago the star of our show, Miss Bonnie Greer, was stricken with a severe case of laryngitis.
Oh-ho-ho, that's too bad.
Oh.
But in the best traditions of show business, our understudy has agreed to go on with the show.
So let's have a great big hand for our plucky little lady, Miss What did you say your name was?
Miss Jeannie of Cocoa Beach.
Oh, bravo!
Power on Like the lights Electric beams Electric haze Electric dreams Electric days Electric nights See the power Flower all around you Yellow zigzags Blooming in the air Bringing lightning To the darkness Of your absolute despair Let me see.
A six-letter word for "rat".
M-A-S No, no, no.
Mustn't be angry with him.
I know.
I will be angry with him until he gets home, and then I will forgive him.
M-A-S-T-E-R.
Master.
Here the vibrations Feel the earth rock Watch the colors Fly about Exploding Into shock  Sweet cosmic music Like electric Drops of rain Sweet flowing rhythms Running freely Through your brain How it flowers All around you Energizing life In every way It's the power of life It's the power of love Power flowers today Electric beams Electric haze Electric dreams Electric days Electric nights Power off     Deliberately disobeyed me.
Went out of her way to embarrass me in front Master?
What is the matter?
Did you not have a good time?
Huh?
What?
Did you not enjoy yourself?
How can you ask me that?
Well, it is It is very simple.
Did you not have fun?
You better come up with a very good explanation, young lady.
Explanation?
Yeah.
For what?
What have I done?
Gonna play that game with me?
Go on.
Get in your bottle.
Oh-ho-ho, master, you have no reason to be angry with me.
I was angry with you.
But I have decided to forgive you.
Oh, you decided to forgive me, huh?
Okay, that's the straw that Go ahead.
Get in your bottle.
Go on.
I'm not fooling around with you anymore.
But I Go on, I've had a tough day.
Go on.
Ooh!
And stay there until you think of a good explanation.
Here.
Jeannie!
I told you to get back.
Jeannie!
Jeannie, now, stop Huh?
Jeannie, you stop playing games and get back in your bottle.
Come on.
Get back in here.
Ah, that's better.
Jeez, I'm probably so shook up I think I'm seeing things.
I just need a little rest.
Maybe I Maybe I've been working too hard.
A little session with Dr. Bellows will straighten everything out.
A couple of months of therapy.
I think maybe we could resolve the whole problem.
Just been working too hard, that's all.
Thanks.
Jeannie!
Hey, Jeannie!
Come back here!
Jeannie!
You want the whole neighborhood to know you're having a fight with your genie?
What's going on, here?
You see Jeannie go out?
No, I didn't see her go out the door.
But what's with the noise?
What's all?
Roger, I'm in trouble.
What's the matter?
You're in trouble.
I just left Dr. Bellows.
You're really in trouble.
Not that kind of trouble.
I mean I think I'm seeing things.
I really do.
I locked Jeannie in her bottle, and 10 seconds later she was walking through here.
In her bottle?
Very funny.
Now, look.
Look.
The cork's gone.
The cork's gone.
Two hundred people are watching you.
You make a fool out of yourself, and you're worried about a cork.
Do you realize what went on back there?
Do you know what you did?
You walked on stage.
You made a fool There she goes!
Tony, I'm trying to tell you the bottle was uncorked.
Huh?
Uncorked.
It's gone too far, Roger.
Jeannie's turned against me.
She can't turn against you.
You're her master.
She has to obey you.
Oh, yeah?
Who says so?
Well, maybe it's in the genie manual.
I don't know.
Well, then how come she deliberately disobeyed me when I told her not to go to that nightclub?
Huh?
How come?
I don't know.
I told her to go to her bottle and she just wouldn't do it.
Well, maybe she wasn't issued a genie manual.
I think she's trying to drive me out of my mind, Roge.
You know something?
I think she's succeeding.
I I corked her on her bottle and 10 seconds later she was just parading all over the house.
Give me that.
Yeah.
Sorry.
I'll get you a nice, warm blanket.
Get yourself a nice, stiff glass of milk.
Hi, Jeannie.
Loved your act.
Good, good.
Hello, Major Healey.
As I was saying, you were terrific.
Whoa, wait.
Hey, now, wait a minute, you better get back in your bottle.
Oh, wait a minute, now.
That's bad geniemanship.
You're in trouble now.
You are gonna get in trouble  Where's Jeannie?
Huh?
Jeannie.
Huh?
You saw her too?
Oh, you shouldn't disappoint Jeannie like that.
I mean, what's more important?
I mean, you job?
Huh?
Or Jeannie?
Huh?
Did you hear that, Jeannie?
I'm on your side.
Will you stop that and help me try to figure something out?
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go home and figure it out, all right?
You can't desert me now.
Come back here.
I'm not deserting you.
I'm leaving.
Roger, look, now that I understand what's bugging her, I can reason with her like a human being.
What's the matter with you, anyhow?
Tony, Tony, Tony, Tony.
Huh?
Let me Let me Don't.
Tony.
You're right.
Boo!
Ah!
Hi, Jeannie!
Look, uh, I Ah!
Jeannie, I am your master and I command you to  Well, that's reasoning with her.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannies to the left of us, Jeannies to the right of us.
Major Nelson.
Major, are you here?
And Dr. Bellows in the middle.
Major Nelson, I want a full explanation of your disgraceful conduct tonight.
Frankly, I was never so shocked in all my life.
Well, stick around, sir.
I think we can top it.
Alfred, now, don't be so pompous.
I'm sure the major has a perfectly good explanation if you'll just give him a chance.
Please, Amanda.
Well, Major Nelson?
Uh, sir, it's late.
Couldn't we talk about this tomorrow?
No, we cannot.
Oh, major, did you find out where you could get one of these exquisite bottles for me?
Uh, no No, that's one of a kind.
Oh, well, why in the world do you keep a hankie stuck in the jar?
Because it's In the morning, major, you will have to explain your conduct to General Peterson.
And I assure you that he will not be as sympathetic towards your, uh, explanations as I am.
So I suggest you get started.
Oh, darling, stop badgering him.
Sir, you're gonna find this hard to believe.
All your explanations are hard to believe.
Oh, darling, give the boy a chance.
I'm sure he'll come up with something.
Have you seen this?
Oh What?
Excuse me.
Oh, Dr. Bellows, if you could just watch me.
It's a very strange dance.
You go this way  That's it.
Ah!
Alfred, Alfred, Alfred!
Shh!
No, not that way.
Spin around.
That's the new stance.
Oh!
Major Huh?
Oh, it's all right.
It's all right.
You look lovely that way.
You really do.
Major Healey, what are you doing?
Uh Uh Uh Uh That's the latest dance.
Major, I ?
?
?
Alfred!
Oh, what?
Alfred!
Alfred!
What's going on, here?
I don't know.
But I'm soon going to find out.
You are the one who is making my master act so strangely.
That's right, darling.
Everything's going according to plan.
And now that Major Nelson thinks you've turned against him, he's going to get rid of you forever.
And that's where I step in.
No!
I will not permit it.
There's only one thing I hadn't counted on.
That stupid Major Healey letting the genie out of the bag.
Sister, you go home!
Major Nelson is mine and I will never give him up.
Oh, well, I have news for you, darling.
He's ready to give you up.
See you later, alligator.
Well, sir, it all started years ago.
What?
What is that?
Years ago, when I first experienced my first earthquake.
Earthquake?
Don't be ridiculous.
Oh!
What?
Uh, under the table.
It's safer.
I I I've always been terrified of earthquakes, sir.
I I felt the first tremor in the nightclub, and And that's when I hit the floor.
It's safer there.
Oh it's not safer here.
Major, I offer you my profound apologies.
If we ever live through this, I'm gonna make it up to you.
Uh Uh, you may live through it, sir, but I'm not so sure about me.
Oh, what's happening?
Oh!
You all right?
Help me up.
Oh.
Oh.
Well, it's over, sir, I think.
Honey, let's go home, quick.
I I wanna see what happened to our house.
Oh, good night, major.
Uh, once more, my apologies.
I'll ever doubt your word again.
Yes.
It's over.
It's over.
Yeah, for them, maybe, but not for you.
Jeannie's still probably here.
Huh?
Ah!
It is all right, master.
It is all right.
It really is over.
My sister is gone.
Your sister?
Yes, my sister.
She was the one who caused all the trouble.
She thought that if she could convince you that I had turned against you, that you would get rid of me.
Yeah.
And then she could have you all to herself.
She was going to put you in a cage.
Yeah, well, it very nearly worked.
Oh, master, I am so sorry.
I promise you she will never bother you again.
I am sending her home to mama on ice.
Master?
Well, what is the matter?
I am your genie.
Can you not tell the difference?
Can you tell?
That reminds me.
I'm gonna make myself a drink on the rocks.
A large drink.
Yeah.
Large rocks.
Large rocks.
Master?
Uh But But  Master!
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Yeah.
Well, the meeting's at 5:00.
It'll probably go on for hours.
See, the exterior dimensions are 38, 23, 35.
Thirty-eight, 22.
What?
Twenty-three.
Thirty-eight, 23, 35.
Thirty-five.
Oh, no, no.
Those are Agnes' dimensions.
Heh, heh, heh.
Who is Agnes?
Oh, Agnes is not a who.
She's a what.
Tony.
Huh?
I'm just I'm on the phone.
I know, but Jeannie isn't.
Hm?
Oh, what are you doing here?
I've told you a thousand times not to come here, Jeannie.
Now get back on the phone.
First, I would like to meet Agnes.
Huh?
I-I-I'll call you back.
Here.
Jeannie, this is Agnes.
Agnes, this is Jeannie.
Uh, Jea Uh Agnes stands for Anti-Gravity Nuclear Earth Station.
Roger and I are giving an evaluation report at 5:00.
Now are you satisfied?
Oh, it is very nice, master.
Very nice, yes.
But it will never get off the ground.
Yes, you see, its kinessive is overextended onto the gibraun.
What?
Right there.
The kinessive is overextended onto the gibraun.
Uh, that certainly wipes out my theory.
We We'd better tell Oglethorpe.
Yeah.
Uh, Jeannie, you're a wonderful girl.
And I I would be the last person in the world to ever underestimate your talents, but Well, frankly, I don't think you have the foggiest notion of whether or not Agnes will fly.
Why not?
Well, my ancestors were flying carpets while yours were still hollowing out canoes.
She got a point there.
Oh, beautiful.
I'll just tell the general: "Um, I'm sorry, sir, I can't approve the plans.
The kinessive overextends onto the gibraun".
Why tell him anything?
Why do you not show him a scale model?
A scale model?
Do you have any idea how much?
Jeannie, a scale model would take months and months of work and hundreds of thousands of dollars.
"Make a scale mo" Hey, look.
Hey, is that it?
Uh-huh.
Oh, that's beautiful!
Look at that, Roge.
Major Nelson!
Dr. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows!
Oh, uh, Major, I've got the results of those tests.
ROBOTIC FEMALE  How do you do?
My name is Agnes.
I am an Anti-Gravity Nuclear Earth Station.
Just what is that?
What is that?
What?
What is that?
Oh, it's It's a child's toy.
Uh, yes, sir.
It's like one of those dolls that you squeeze and it says, uh, "Change me, Mommy".
Huh?
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Yeah.
But I distinctly heard it say: "My name is Agnes".
It was lying.
It looks like Agnes.
I wanna know where this toy came from, hm?
Oglethorpe must see this at once.
How about that?
Good thinking?
"Child's toy".
Ha.
Always using the old brain.
Yeah, terrific, Roge.
Yeah, now I want you to think of something to tell Mr. Oglethorpe when he finds out that his radical new space station that he designed is already a child's toy.
And his plans are still on the NASA drawing board.
Bad thinking.
Bad.
Bad.
Jeannie!
As I was saying, master, you can see that the kinessive is I would like you to take Agnes and get outta here, please.
But, master, you need me.
No.
No buts.
Find something to occupy your time until we're through with the project.
Oh!
No "oh".
Please.
Now.
Go.
Thank you.
Oh, Jeannie!
Yes?
Mm.
Huh?
Oh.
Great, now what are we gonna do when Dr. Bellows brings in Oglethorpe?
The same thing Agnes did.
What's that?
Lie.
I never heard anything so ridiculous.
If it's gonna start, then why doesn't it start now?
You know as well as I do.
I wanna know where it came from.
Thirty-eight, Where's Agnes?
Huh?
Agnes?
Agnes?
Agnes.
Oh, oh, Agnes, yes.
Well, here are the blueprints right here, sir.
No, no, no, no.
Not the drawing.
The model.
The toy.
The toy?
Toy?
The toy that was right here.
Th-that talks.
Like the doll that you squeeze and it says: "Change me, Mommy".
Uh, we've all been under a lot of, ahem, pressure lately trying to make the deadline.
And when you squeezed it, it said, "Change me, Mama".
No!
It said, "My name is Agnes".
If you say so, sir.
Doctor.
Agnes wouldn't talk.
She'd bleep.
Bleep?
Oh!
Excuse me.
I'd better take the rest of the afternoon off.
Hi, Jase.
Oh, hi, Pop.
Did you get it?
Did I get it?
Take a look at this.
Ah, there it is.
A remote-control box for a TV set?
Pop, we don't have a TV set.
Ah, but we will have.
Dozens of 'em, if we want.
When this little dandy is hooked up the MacWhorter flying stratosub will be operational and marketable.
Who ever heard of a flying submarine?
Who ever heard of a Hula-Hoop?
You pawned the motorcycle for this?
You're looking at me that way again, Jase.
What way?
Oh, the way that says I'm an irresponsible, impractical phony, who would rather invent toys that don't sell than take a job and support his son.
I'm sorry.
Don't be, it's true.
At least it was, but not after this.
Not after the MacWhorter flying stratosub hits the toy market.
Come on.
Let's go to the park and give it a try.
Pop?
What if it doesn't work?
Well, why shouldn't it work?
It's got exactly the same mechanism as the MacWhorter heat-seeking missile.
I know.
And that one went through Mrs. Drexel's kitchen window and crashed right into her stove.
See, it worked.
It was seeking heat.
This is it, Jase.
Okay, Pop.
You can blast off anytime.
You keep a close track on it.
Fame and fortune, here we come.
It's gonna work.
It works.
It's working.
Jase, it works.
We're gonna be rich.
It's working.
We're gonna be rich.
Oh, God, look at it go.
MacWHORTER: We're gonna be rich.
We're gonna be rich.
Okay, Pop, bring it back.
I can't.
It won't respond.
There it goes.
All right, you keep it in sight, son.
Oh.
Is this your toy, little boy?
It was.
There goes another million down the tubes.
Aw.
I am sorry it is broken.
Would you like another toy to play with?
No thanks, lady.
I'm trying to kick the habit.
Oh, well you may have Agnes.
I'm too old for girls.
Oh, no, no, no.
This is Agnes.
What is it?
Well, I-it is called an Anti-Gravity Nuclear Earth Station.
Agnes.
Yeah.
I've never seen anything like this.
Where'd you get it?
I made it.
What's it do?
Well, I-I-it is supposed to orbit the moon, but this one will not fly.
Boy, I wish this could fly.
Do you?
Hey, that's great.
I'd like to see it land.
It obeys my voice.
Agnes, stop.
It must have a self-contained voice modulation response unit.
If you say so.
Why do you not play with it for a while?
Can I?
Mm-hm.
Gee, thanks, lady.
Agnes, up.
Agnes, forward march.
Agnes, halt.
Agnes, down.
Agnes, up.
Agnes, forward march.
Way to go.
I understand these things.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Hard work, not enough sleep.
Uh, good morning, sir.
After all, one low-grade hallucination doesn't necessarily mean that a man has flipped his lid, does it?
I Agnes?
I knew it.
I knew it.
Agnes!
Here!
Come back here, Agnes.
Come back here, and that's an order.
Halt.
Hello, son.
Well, that's quite a toy you've got up there.
Did I hear you call it Agnes?
Yes, sir.
Where did you get it?
From that lady over there.
She made it herself.
What lady?
Well, she was there a minute ago.
Now listen, son.
As you can see, I'm a United States Air Force colonel.
Now, I don't want you to move from here.
And don't let Agnes out of your sight.
Why, you may be able to help me plug up a top-secret security leak.
Oh, now, don't move from here.
Here, Agnes.
Come to Papa.
Pop, you can't do that.
She belongs to a lady.
What lady?
The one who was on that park bench.
She's gone.
Well, you certainly can't give it to her if she's not there.
I'll take it.
She built it.
It's her idea.
Are you suggesting your own father would steal somebody else's idea?
No, Pop, but Well, I should hope not.
Now, look, Jase, you go on home and stay in your room until I get there.
That colonel told me not to move.
Who's your superior officer: Him or me?
You, Pop.
Move out.
Agnes, baby, what do you say we see if you're patented?
You what?
Well, I-I gave Agnes to a little boy to play with in the park.
Oh, but do not worry, master.
He's a very nice little boy.
And his daddy is a toymaker too, so he was very interested.
Y-You get it back.
Get it back.
I don't care how.
Get it back and get rid of it permanently.
Puh!
But, master, he's just a little boy.
Permanently.
Goodbye.
"My master is a meanie".
Huh?
Oh, get it, get it, get it, get it.
"My master is a meanie".
Oh, listen, I think we're in trouble.
Huh?
Oh, don't Don't worry.
When Jeannie knows what to do, she'll do it.
Yeah.
Anyway, they'll never be able to prove there was a model.
Yeah.
Ha, ha.
Yeah.
Let me in there.
Where?
Now, hold on, Oglethorpe.
There's no need to jump to conclusions.
Did?
You were the one who saw her.
This morning.
Well, I know, but I Then Then again, in the park.
Just now.
Well?
Did you or didn't you?
Yes, but I'm sure there's some explanation.
And I know what it is.
These two stole our new top-secret weapon, and they sold it to a toy manufacturer.
I demand that Mr. Oglethorpe retract that statement.
If he believes there's a toy replica of Agnes around, I insist that he produce it.
He's got you there, Oglethorpe.
You'll have to produce evidence.
What about you?
You saw Agnes yourself.
I saw what I thought was Agnes.
Yes.
Uh, it could be one of thousands of Of space toys.
There are thousands on the market.
Blazes.
The boy called it Agnes.
Yeah.
It It looked like Agnes.
It blinked like Agnes.
Sir, if these allegations are to continue, I demand that we be formally charged and And brought to trial in the highest military court.
Liberty and justice for all.
With liberty and justice for All right, Nelson.
There can't be that many toy manufacturers in Cocoa Beach.
I'm going out to look for Agnes, and you two better pray I don't find her.
Uh Uh Oglethorpe.
Oh, uh, he won't find her, will he?
No, of course not, sir.
How could he?
Ha, ha, ha.
Ah.
Okay.
Ah.
Great speech, Tony.
Great speech.
Thanks, Roge.
Now we'd better work on the one we're gonna give when we're in front of the firing squad.
Huh?
Hi, Pop.
Oh, Jase.
Glad you're back.
Wait till you see what I've got for you.
I'm sorry I ran off.
I went back to the park.
Don't think another thing about it, son.
Unreasonable orders are made to be disobeyed.
Pop.
Hm?
This is Jeannie.
She found me there.
She owns Agnes.
H-how do you do?
That's a great toy you invented, miss.
A great toy.
Think fast, son.
What's this?
That is a football.
And over there is a football helmet and a baseball bat and a pitcher's glove, and And that's a muscle-building set.
You always wanted to be the strongest boy on the block.
What'd you do, Pop, rob a bank?
Nope.
But while you were gone, your old man signed a contract to sell Agnes to Astro Toys, Incorporated.
Isn't that marvelous, Miss, uh, Jeannie?
Marvelous?
Oh, that is terrible.
Now, look, I know what you're gonna say: Agnes wasn't mine to sell.
You're right.
You invented it, and you're in for 50 percent.
Look at it this way, uh, Miss Jeannie: If you invented a marvelous toy like Agnes, you can invent plenty of others.
Right?
You're a genius.
Genie.
Genius is plural.
Sure.
But, me, I I've been trying to crack the toy market for years.
The MacWhorter heat-seeking missile.
The MacWhorter flying stratosub.
And hundreds of others.
But nobody was interested.
You know why?
Because they were junk.
I'm a fake and a fraud.
No, you're not, Pop.
Listen, Jeannie.
With Agnes, for the first time, I'm able to give Jason the things he deserves.
Jeannie, you're being taken.
My dad may be a lousy toy inventor, but he's the greatest con man in the world.
Right.
And I'm exactly what you need for a partner.
Now, how about it, Jeannie?
For Jase?
One for all, and all for one?
Um I-I-I will be right back.
You?
You let him keep it?
Oh, master.
If you could see the way he loves his son.
All the wonderful things he wants to do for him.
Oh, I could not take Agnes away from them.
Oh.
Jeannie.
It would break my heart.
Yeah, break your heart.
Steak, medium rare.
Mashed potatoes.
CrÃªpe suzette.
Roger, what are you doing?
I'm rehearsing for my last meal.
Oh.
Do you have any idea what they're gonna do to us if Oglethorpe finds Agnes?
Oh, master, I would not let them do anything to you.
I would blink you away.
Oh, great.
We could go live with my family in Baghdad.
Well, there's not a heck of a lot for an astronaut to do in Baghdad, Jeannie.
Oh, yes.
You are You are right.
Yeah.
Well, I will try again.
Hey, wait a minute.
I'm going with you.
You're too soft.
Oh.
Heh.
Don't you want me to order for you?
But I had no idea.
Why, Astro's Toys, Inc. Is a most reputable firm.
How could such a thing like this have happened?
Well, we don't know, exactly.
I do know this.
That if you know the whereabouts of Agnes, and you withhold the information, you'll find yourself charged as an accessory.
Of course, major.
I understand perfectly.
After all, what's a small boy's faith in his father compared to the national security?
Oh, uh, Mr. MacWhorter, now, I I I didn't Not another word, major.
I'm sorry, son, but the football will have to go back.
And the football helmet.
And the baseball bat.
And the muscle-building set.
Oh, brother.
Oh, master, you see how sad it is.
Mr. MacWhorter, if it's money you want, I could certainly lend you Absolutely not, major.
We MacWhorters still have our pride, don't we, son?
How much did you have in mind, major?
I know you're there, Nelson!
Get out.
Excuse me, major, would you hold this?
Oh.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Here, here.
Gotcha.
They can't do anything to us.
We're innocent.
So was Joan of Arc.
You saw Agnes!
I thought I saw Agnes.
Gentlemen, please.
Oh, I think I'll give myself up.
Oh, Roger, pull yourself together.
Yeah.
I won't give myself up.
No!
Hello.
What are you doing here?
I'm waiting for my court-martial.
What are you doing here?
Court-martial?
But why?
"Why"?
NASA gets a little testy about people giving away their top secrets, that's why.
Oh, but that is not a top secret.
Well, it would not even fly unless I help it.
I told you about the kinessive.
Oh, Jeannie, will you stop with the kinessi?
Unless you can help it?
Well, I made it fly.
Can you put it back the way it was?
Oh, but of course.
Oh, Jeannie, I could kiss you.
Oh!
That is a lovely idea.
How about me?
I'm being court-martialed too.
Off.
Get out.
They're coming to get us.
You gotta get out.
Get up.
Major Healy.
I'm up.
Remember, you're an officer.
Yes, sir.
All right, gentlemen.
They're ready for you.
Yes, sir.
Uh, good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Gentlemen, I have here physical proof, and corroborating evidence from several witnesses who are willing and ready to testify, that the security on Project Agnes has been irreparably compromised.
I insist court-martial procedures be instituted immediately against Major Nelson and Major Healy.
Uh, Major Nelson, say something.
Major Healy, for heaven's sake, say something.
You're standing on my foot.
Uh, there's been a little misunderstanding here.
You'll laugh when I tell you what happened.
Well, uh, Major Healy and I were asked to evaluate Agnes here as a possible new flying platform responsive to voice command.
And it worked, so you sold it!
Mr. Oglethorpe, do you insist that that is Is Agnes?
Well, of course this is Agnes.
Toynapper.
Well, if it's Agnes, I'm afraid it won't work.
Slander.
Libel!
General, I protest.
Sir, anyone with half an eye can see that the kinessive overextends into the gibraun.
You say Agnes won't fly?
That's correct.
Watch.
Agnes, up.
Agnes, up.
Up.
Agnes, it's me, Marvin.
Your inventor.
Up.
Please.
Uppy.
You need help?
Agnes, fly.
What is this?
It's just a cheap toy.
An impostor.
Agnes would never do this to me.
Would you, baby?
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're gonna have to reconsider the whole project.
And its designer.
Back to the drawing board, Oglethorpe.
I knew it.
I knew there was nothing to it.
Oglethorpe.
Uh, Major We're prepared to drop the whole thing, sir.
Well, that's very good of you.
Imagine mistaking a child's toy for a complex piece of aeronautical hardware.
ROBOTIC FEMALE  My name is Agnes.
Change me, Mommy.
It's, uh, just a child's toy.
How do you do?
It's just a child's toy.
My name is Agnes.
Just a child's toy.
So if she's of any use to you at all, Agnes is yours, free and clear.
And I do not wish to be a partner, Mr. MacWhorter.
You and Jason may have it all.
Well, that's very generous of the both of you, but, uh, if what you say is true, uh I mean, if it breaks the first time it flies Looks like we got another stratosub, huh, Pop?
W-Wait a minute.
MacWhorter, just think: A toy that breaks the first time you use it.
Why, it is the ultimate in planned obsolescence.
The perfect toy.
Ha, ha.
Why, we'll make millions!
Right, uh, partners?
Eh, well, if you put it that way, Beattie.
What do you say, son?
Anything you say, Pop.
May we go home now, please?
Yeah, any place you want.
Any place?
Yeah.
MacWHORTER: Major?
Miss Jeannie?
Where did they go?
I wanted to thank them.
Oh, well, no one knows, MacWhorter.
They go around helping people all the time, then they just disappear off into the sunset.
Kinda chokes you up, doesn't it?
Well, happy toys.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
MAN : Ladies and gentlemen, today caps the last day of a full week of festivities in honor of the victorious Apollo 15 astronauts.
After a ticker tape parade through New York's financial district, Major Nelson, Major Healey and Captain Larkin, will be honored at a White House luncheon.
And finally, one last press conference at Cocoa Beach.
Major Nelson, do you feel you may be in line for a promotion?
Uh, well, I couldn't comment on that.
Major Healey, do you have any idea?
Major Healey One at a time, please.
Did you anticipate any problems in the recovery?
I think I can speak for Captain Larkin and Major Nelson when I say we had complete faith in the carrier.
Uh, Major Nelson, we've heard quite a bit about Major Healey and Captain Larkin's home life, but not a word about yours.
How about it, major, is there a girl?
Uh, I'm sorry, but as the Air Force would say, my private life comes under the category of restricted information.
Restricted to me.
Next.
You know, the guy that gets an exclusive on Nelson's private life is a cinch for the Pulitzer Prize.
Hello.
Acme Plumbing Company.
I'm here to inspect your pipes.
Oh.
Well, there is nothing wrong with my pipes.
Well, you see, there is a new city ordinance.
Says, "Every house more than 10 years old has to have the pipes inspected".
My master did not say anything about an inspection.
Oh, your master didn't.
Well, I wouldn't worry about that.
I mean, everything that I have to see, I can see in 10 masters.
Uh, minutes.
Excuse me.
I did not know there were pipes in the fireplace.
Uh Look, uh, lady.
Y-you take care of your business, and, uh, I'll take care of mine.
Are you finished yet?
Uh, yes, actually.
As a matter of fact, I am.
Your pipes are in good shape.
You have very good pipes.
As a matter of fact, um, uh, w-w-what is your business?
Well, I am a genie.
That's very funny.
Strike that.
Well, lady, so long.
I have to be going now, and, uh, happy genie-ing.
Strike that too.
Well.
Dear.
He's finally gone, and I can prepare for my master's homecoming in peace.
Now, let me see.
Ah!
Oh, that is a nice touch.
I have always liked balloons.
Major Healey.
Master.
Hi.
Welcome home.
Thanks.
I planned a little party, master.
Are you not pleased?
It's just wonderful, yeah.
Tony, Tony, they're here.
They're here.
Doors!
Doors!
The curtains, the curtains!
Master?
Do you not wish your friends to come to your party?
Oh What?
Roger, would you get out?
Roger.
They're here.
They're here.
Yeah, I know.
Master, friends make a party.
Yeah, I know, but those are reporters.
They're not friends.
They're report  Would you get rid of these balloons, please?
Yes, master.
Listen, if we're gonna have a party, how about blinking in some dancing girls and champagne?
No, Roger, would you please?
All right.
Forget the dancing girls, they don't have to dance, and I'll get the champagne.
Party, yeah.
See, Jeannie, the problem is we've been We've been partied and paraded and banqueted, and we're just exhausted, that's all.
Oh, my poor master.
I am sorry, I did not realize.
Yeah, and those reporters have been pestering me for details about my personal life.
Oh, master, I will take care of them instantly.
No.
No, no.
Don't do anything like that.
It would just make them curious, and we certainly wouldn't want them curious, would we.
Oh, no, master.
Because Because in your private life, you have a genie.
Yeah.
Me.
And they simply would not understand about that.
You're learning.
You are learning.
And besides, I've really gotta get some rest.
Major Nelson.
Here, you open this.
I'll I'll get the door.
No.
No, I'll get it.
Major Nelson.
Come on out.
MAN 2: Major Nelson, just answer a question.
Major Nelson.
Major Nelson.
Do you mow your own lawn?
Fellas.
Fellas, please, please.
I have no further comments about anything.
What is this thing?
Hey.
Hey, talk about privacy.
This is really something.
Jeannie, that is not what I meant.
What he means, Jeannie, is a man's home is his castle.
Yeah.
Oh!
Now I understand.
You know, I guess he really means it.
I guess he does.
Wally.
Do you see what I see?
That depends on what you see.
Forget it.
I don't really see anything.
What did you just do?
What did you do?
What did you blink?
When did you put in the moat?
The moat?
I'm sorry to bother you again, but I left some tools Shh!
When I was here What?
Please, my master is asleep.
Oh.
I'll be very quiet.
I just wanna pick up my tools.
Well, I have not seen any tools.
Huh.
I am sure that I left them here.
I'll tell you what.
Shh!
Why don't you go look in the kitchen?
Around the drainboard, and places like that, and I'll just look around in here.
Very well.
You must not be a good plumber if you keep losing your tools.
Yeah, well, perhaps.
I'm not a very good plumber, no.
But I'm a heck of a good reporter.
Mm.
Maybe I can get a shot of the major while he's still asleep.
No, do not go in there.
Ow!
Ow.
Shh!
Please.
I'm trying to sleep, please.
You see what you have done?
You've woke him up.
"Woke him up"?
I think I broke my toe!
Jeannie.
Oh!
Oh, master, are you all right?
I've heard of houses being burglar-proof, but this is ridiculous.
Who is he?
Oh, he is just a plumber.
He's not a plumber, he's a reporter.
Stop him.
Stop him!
Stop him!
Ow!
Ow-w-w-w.
A reporter.
You lied to me.
I think that we're even.
This is Farnum.
What's this all about anyhow?
You.
Who have a house full of booby traps.
You ask me what this is all about?
Shall I?
No, no.
no.
You go out and make some coffee.
With your hands.
Major.
You have got some explaining to do.
Mr. Farnum, I believe at my press conference I told you all reporters that my private life is my own personal business.
Forget it, major.
You are public property.
And when, on top of being an astronaut, you have got a house that is like Sing Sing South, and a girlfriend who thinks she's a genie, and goes around the house calling you "master," well, I'd say that was news.
If you think it's news, you just go ahead and print it.
Nobody in their right mind is gonna believe it.
On the other hand, now, if you want to be sensible about this, maybe we can come to some sort of an arrangement.
Like what?
Well, like you tell me your whole story.
Your hopes, your dreams, your bank balance, about this genie lady, I'll write the story, win the Pulitzer Prize, sell it to the movies, and you'll be off the hook.
Yeah, that's what you think.
No dice, Farnum.
Take your best shot.
Hm.
Well.
I think that you're gonna be surprised at how good my best shot is.
Well.
Your word against mine.
Yes, my word  And a roll of film and a spool of tape.
So long, major.
See you on the front page.
Huh?
Coffee is ready, master.
Now, wait a minute.
Are you gonna take these bars away, or do I have to add a section on how you kidnap reporters too?
Go ahead, Jeannie.
Take the bars away.
I think he's got us.
Yes, master.
Where'd that go?
How'd they do that?
How has he got us?
Oh, he's got a spool of tape and a roll of film.
Oh, that is what he was putting in his tool chest.
In his tool chest?
Stop him.
Stop him!
Yes, master.
Now, look, Nelson.
The tool chest.
Come on, Jeannie.
The tool chest.
Oh, yes, master.
Yes.
Hand it over, Farnum.
Oh, no, you don't.
Oh, no, you don't.
This is my personal property.
Okay, Jeannie.
Oh, with pleasure, master.
Okay.
I'll get you for this, Nelson.
Nobody ever gets the best of Charlie Farnum.
Well, then.
How does it feel to be two of America's heroes?
Well, I've always been loyal, brave, true, kind to small children and animals We were just doing our job, sir.
Tony!
Darling, after all these years, I've finally found you again.
Yeah, hi.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Who are you?
Tony, don't you recognize your own wife and children?
Major Nelson, what's the meaning of this?
I don't know, sir.
I-I-I don't know.
I've never seen these people.
Would you let go, lady?
I don't blame you for not recognizing the kids.
They was only little tykes when he ran out on us.
But me, Tony, your own wife.
Have I changed that much?
I I'm not your daddy, son.
I mean, I'm not your daddy, period.
Madam.
Madam.
Oh, madam, please.
I'm afraid you've made a terrible mistake.
You see, we have complete records on Major Nelson, and he's never been married.
No, sir, you wouldn't know about it.
He kept it a secret the whole time we was together.
You see, his folks was against it.
Oh, but here's a marriage license.
Marriage?
License?
Let me see.
Yeah, right there.
Hey, wait a minute!
His marriage license.
Let's all board the astronaut engine.
Would you?
Sir, that signature is obviously a forgery.
My signature is public record.
It's a forgery.
Obviously a forgery.
Well, then there's this: Taken 10 years ago.
Before little Joey was born.
Sir, my picture's been in all the papers for years.
That's been doctored.
You certainly haven't changed much in 10 years.
Would you mind explaining?
Tony, how can you say things like that.
When I treasured this picture for 10 years not knowing where you were or if you were alive.
And then when I read in the paper that you had become an astronaut, well  Oh, now, madam, please.
Please.
Don't cry, please.
All this is going to be thoroughly straightened out.
And I promise you a very fair Please, sir.
A fair hearing.
And until then, you'll just have to wait.
But we've waited so long.
And besides, we don't have any money.
We spent it all on bus fare.
Where will we stay?
Hey, wait a minute!
What'll become of the children?
Why don't we put them at Tony's house?
He has room.
Roger!
That would be a good solution.
Nobody's staying at my house.
Children, did you hear that?
We're gonna live with Daddy.
Hey, hey.
Hey, hey, take it easy!
All right, major.
Hold it.
All right, the two kids can sleep upstairs, and you can sleep in there, Mrs  "Nelson," naturally.
Naturally?
Hey, hey, hey.
Roger, would you do something?
Children.
I don't have it.
Children.
Throw it over here.
I got it, Tony.
Oh, stop.
All right, take it easy.
Down, down.
Interesting bottle.
Huh?
Oh, shh!
You all go up and mind your mother.
Go upstairs.
Go on.
Come on, children.
Enjoyed the game.
You remember.
I always was an obedient wife.
Yeah.
Upstairs, or All right.
She is obedient.
Jeannie, are you all right?
She looks a little dizzy to me.
From being thrown around in that bottle.
Yeah.
You have a wife and two children.
You don't believe that, do you?
That's a fraud.
Farnum must be trying to set me up or blackmail me.
I mean, just because she has a marriage license Roger, that's not necessary.
A marriage license.
Look, Jeannie.
Oh!
It's a put up job, really.
It's not I need your help.
I really do.
You've gotta help him.
I mean, the family picture with Tony and his kids, I Oh, Major Healey.
A picture?
A picture?
Why don't you just go home?
Go.
Oh, you want to be alone with your wife.
You haven't seen her in 10 years.
Roger, why don't you?
I'll get it.
Stay here and don't move.
Stay there.
Extra, extra.
Read all about it.
Astronaut deserts wife and children.
Read all about it.
I, uh I rather expected you.
Don't try and get this picture, major, because I have got the negatives safely stashed away where you and your magician of a girlfriend can't get at it.
You know, you really amaze me, going to all this trouble.
Setting me up with a wife and two children just so you can get the story of my private life.
You know us newsmen, major.
If we can't get the real story, we create one.
Then you admit it.
Sure.
The only question is, what do you do?
Do I get the real story, or do I spread this one all over the front pages?
Does that convince you, Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Where's Jeannie?
Gone.
Gone?
Yeah, she said she didn't wanna stay around and be the other woman.
Don't worry, Tony.
This time I believe you.
Oh, excuse me, major.
Hello, sir.
Have you found out anything yet?
Well, now, these things take time, major.
We gotta check back 10 years into her story as well as yours.
How about those kids?
They're monsters.
You don't Hello, darling.
There they are.
Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Good morning.
It'd be nice if you took the children and me to lunch.
Lunch?
Yes.
Good morn Good morning, Dr. Bellows.
Good morning.
That sure is a great-looking uniform.
Well, thank you, son.
Good morning, Uncle Alfred.
You sure do look good this morning.
Well, thank you.
Monsters?
Why, they're charming.
And this one's the spitting image of you.
Now, boys.
On the way out, be sure you stop into my office.
I have some bubblegum for you.
Hey, that's great.
Yeah, great.
No, Dr. Bellows, please.
Don't go, Dr. Bellows.
Hey, hey, hey.
Take it easy.
Wait a minute.
Hey, kids, wait a minute, will you?
That's my stuff.
Hey.
Easy, easy.
Oh, God.
Hi, Ton.
Say, I was wondering.
Could you lend me 10 dollars?
Tony?
What are you doing on the desk?
I'm sleeping on my desk.
Why are you sleeping on your desk?
Because somebody's sleeping in my house.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What's the matter with me, you can come stay at my place.
Could I?
Could you?
What's a friend for?
Thanks, Roge.
There's only one thing.
Make sure there's no porch light on.
Okay.
I can sleep up in your bed in the den.
And one other thing.
Make sure it's after 2:00 in the morning.
After 2:00 in the morning?
Oh, and very important.
If there's no key under the mat  Forget it.
forget it.
Jeannie, where have you been?
In Reno.
Reno, Nevada?
No.
