{START OF EPISODE 01}
- Sweetheart, you look beautiful.
- Thank you, darling.
- What time is our reservation?
- Eight o'clock.
- Any regrets about not having a party?
- Nope.
I want to celebrate our first wedding anniversary alone.
So do I. How about us?
One whole year.
Aunt Clara.
Oh, dear.
I thought I'd drop in to wish you a happy anniversary.
Come here, Aunt Clara.
But I didn't know it was gonna be so hard a drop.
Oh, dear.
- Let me help you up.
- Up we go.
- Let me fix your hat.
- Doesn't look like anything's broken.
I want to wish you a happy anniversary and give you these tokens of my affection.
If I can find them, of course.
Aunt Clara, you shouldn't have.
- Well, now, I think that's yours.
- Thank you.
And that's yours.
- Let's open them inside.
- All right.
- Oh, no.
- Right over here.
- Oh, let me take this.
- Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Aunt Clara, what a lovely apron.
That is beautiful, Aunt Clara.
- Let me see.
- Let's see what we have here.
A golf cap.
Just what I've been meaning to buy.
I'm going to put this in the kitchen and wear it at breakfast.
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
- I think it's a little small.
- I'll exchange it.
Don't be silly.
No, I'll cast a spell, and everything will be quite all right.
Don't go to any trouble.
Aba-daba-daba Daba-daba-aba Remedium decapito zipperary I goofed.
Aunt Clara, I'm terribly sorry we have to run out on you but we have a reservation for 8:00.
- What's that?
- That's your husband.
Darrin?
Darrin.
Darrin.
What did she do to you?
Well, the cap was too small and I made it the right size, but I got it on the wrong head.
Aunt Clara, this is terrible.
You bring Darrin back right this minute.
Well Zilcho kazza directo Chavis havis formsby I think you'd better do this for me, dear.
Yes, maybe I'd better.
What words did you use?
- What words?
- What magic words?
What magic words?
Well, I started with "aba-daba-daba " "Aba " Or was it, "aba-daba-doo"?
Please, Aunt Clara, you have to remember.
This is very serious.
If you can't remember the exact words then you can't break that spell, and neither can I. Is that so?
Oh, dear.
You mean, not even you, a bloody relation?
Excuse me, a blood relation?
Not even anyone.
I began with "daba-daba-diba.
" Sweetheart.
Sweetheart, can you understand me?
If you can, raise your right hand.
Well, thank heaven.
At least you're still here in spirit.
Now, don't you worry, darling.
We'll have you back in your own body before you know it.
Meanwhile, I better call the Starlight Roof and tell them we'll be a little late.
Darrin, breakfast is ready.
Morning, darling.
How did you sleep?
Lousy?
Well, I'm sorry, but I didn't sleep too well either.
Now, Darrin, why don't you try to relax and eat your breakfast.
What would you like?
Darrin, breakfast is the Thank you.
- Most important meal of the day.
Black coffee is not enough.
How about a nice ripe banana?
Oh, Darrin, please.
I'm terribly sorry.
I wasn't thinking.
Darrin, please come back.
Please?
Larry Tate, please.
Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
Hi, Larry.
Oh, I'm fine.
But I'm afraid Darrin isn't, so he won't be able to go to work today.
No, no, nothing serious.
Let's just say he isn't his usual self.
May you speak with him?
No.
Why?
Well because he lost his voice.
He's got laryngitis.
Yes, that's what he's got, all right.
A very severe case of laryngitis.
Oh, I will, Larry.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
Sweetheart, Larry wishes you a very speedy recovery.
Good morning, Samantha.
Mother, there's something I have to tell you.
- Good morning, Derwood.
- Darrin.
- Whatever.
- You recognized him.
I'd know Delbert anywhere.
I just left your Aunt Clara.
Poor dear, she feels terribly guilty.
Samantha, should you allow him to sit on the sofa?
He'll shed hair all over it.
It's his house.
He can shed hair wherever he wants.
How remarkable, a writing chimpanzee.
- "Tell her to get lost.
" - Who?
Me?
- Mother.
- What?
I think our problem amuses you.
Oh, Samantha, how can you say such a thing?
You're my children.
You're my daughter.
He's my son-in-law.
I love him very, very, very much.
Don't be a hypocrite.
You didn't love him before, why would you love him now?
He needs me.
He also needs something to go out and play in.
Oh, that's adorable.
Come on, precious, try it on.
Oh, Darrin.
Did I insult him?
He probably thinks it would make him look like a sissy.
I hate to criticize a man when he's down, Samantha but Donald always struck me as being overly sensitive.
His name is Darrin.
- Mother.
- What?
Would you stay here and take care of him?
I have to go out for a while.
You want me to be a chimpsitter?
Yes.
I'll be back in less than an hour.
Where are you going?
I haven't got time to tell you now but believe me, it's very important.
I'll be back in a little bit.
Thank you, Mother.
Don't stay and sulk up in your room, David.
Come on down.
Mother Endora will comb you.
Oh, come on, now.
You want to be a pretty chimp, don't you?
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
You're Samantha's mother.
We met in Paris.
- Oh, that's right.
And you're?
- I'm Larry Tate.
- Darrin's boss.
- Oh, of course.
Please come in.
I'm having lunch with a client of Darrin's and I'll need Darrin to brief me.
Oh, I'm aware he has laryngitis, but he can write me notes.
Oh, yes.
Yes, he can.
I'll tell him you're here.
Will you excuse me?
Forgive me for barging in, but Mr. Tate wants to see you so you can write him notes about a client.
Why not?
Darrin, it's me, Larry.
I want you to brief Where is he?
Abner, I whipped up a batch of my icebox cookies.
Now I'm going over and give some to Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
Why do you want to inflict suffering on such a nice couple?
My icebox cookies are very unusual.
I know.
You make them out of real iceboxes.
Darwin?
Darwin?
Here, boy.
Here, boy.
Come on home.
Endora was only teasing.
Well, he's probably hanging around here somewhere.
Abner, open up.
Abner!
Come on in, sweetie pie.
Come on.
Come on in.
Hey, get up here.
That's it.
That's it.
I thought your sister wasn't coming till next week.
Don't make jokes.
Shut the door so that he doesn't escape.
Golf cap and a tuxedo.
He's ready for anything.
I wonder why he was at the Stephens' front door?
Coincidence.
He was wandering around the neighbourhood.
Maybe he knows her.
Strange people have strange friends.
- I wonder where he belongs?
- He belongs in a zoo.
And so do you.
Will you please give me the number of the Municipal Zoo?
- Abner.
- What?
Abner, he looks familiar.
I know he's a total stranger but around the eyes, he looks familiar.
Take your medicine, Gladys.
Darrin?
Mother?
- Darrin, where are you?
- He's not here, dear.
- I've been looking all over for him.
- Well, where's Mother?
She said she'd stay here and take care of him.
- Well, she isn't here either.
- Oh, Aunt Clara, I have to find him.
Oh, dear.
I know.
Don't worry, dear.
Don't worry.
I have my book of spells and sooner or later we'll find the words that made a monkey out of Darrin.
Yes, but are we gonna find the words to find Darrin?
Oh, Aunt Clara, I don't even know where to start looking.
Oh, yes.
Don't you worry, dear.
Don't you worry.
He'll probably come swinging in here any minute.
I certainly hope so because I have something very important to tell him.
Yeah?
I've just been to the doctor.
Aunt Clara, we're gonna have a baby.
- We are?
- Darrin and I. Oh, my dear.
Oh, my dear.
Well, that's marvellous.
It's marvellous.
Oh, dear.
- Thank you, Aunt Clara.
- Oh, dear.
- I'll be a great aunt.
- You've always been a great aunt.
And Endora is going to be a granny.
I can hardly wait to see her face when we tell her.
Yes.
Well, Aunt Clara I think perhaps I better be the one to break the news to Mother.
Oh, she'll be hysterical.
Yes, I know.
That's why I want to be the one to pick the right time and place to tell her.
Now, do you understand?
Oh, yes, of course, dear.
Of course.
Yes.
First I have to tell Darrin, wherever he is.
Even if we don't know who you are we can't have you wandering around loose, can we?
So here's your new home, with three nice playmates.
Oh, well, that's marvellous.
Yes, yes, thank you very much.
My, you certainly work fast.
My guess was right.
A stray chimpanzee was reported in the neighbourhood so a man from the zoo came over and got it.
Him.
Darrin is safe and sound, locked in a cage.
- Who turned him in?
- I forgot to ask.
I'll pop over and get him out.
Now, Aunt Clara, you wait here and keep going over these spells and try to come up with the one.
I'll be back with Darrin soon.
Now, now, wait a minute, dear.
Remember, your condition and fly carefully.
Darrin.
Darrin.
Which one of you is Darrin Stephens?
Oh, sweetheart.
I'm glad you're safe, but why were you sitting in there all alone?
Why don't you mingle?
"I feel fundamentally we have very little in common.
" Charles Darwin wouldn't agree with you.
All right, sweetheart.
I'll unlock the door.
Eureka!
Eureka!
Eureka!
I thought you were gonna wait for us at home.
Yes, yes, I know.
But I've been so excited.
I was so excited, I had to see you immediately.
Thank you, dear.
I found it.
I found it.
The exact original words?
It's in volume nine.
- Aunt Clara.
- Yes.
Maybe you better tell me and let me do it.
Oh, no, no.
I want to redeem myself.
I know you do, sweetheart, but I think perhaps Rafino dalino salino Oh, for goodness' sakes.
Oh, marvellous.
Now he can't even write notes.
Here, let me do it.
Where is this thing?
Aba-daba-daba Daba-daba-ooba Ooba-dooba-dooba Remedio decapito zippidaro Oh, thank you.
Itsy-bitsy weetendotten At last.
I wasn't even close, you know.
Hey, you get out of there immediately.
Wise guy, huh?
Teasing innocent chimpanzees.
Don't you know you can make them neurotic?
- Sorry, it won't happen again.
- You bet it won't.
I've a good mind to place you under a citizen's arrest.
Oh, well Well, I'm going to take this because if I don't, you'll just spend it on whiskey.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Samantha, I am usually a very tolerant person, but Aunt Clara, may we have a few words in private?
- Yes, you and me?
- No, Darrin and I. Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Well, I think I'll go home now and revise my diary.
Well One, two, three, height Oh, well, it's a nice day.
You know, I think I'll walk.
Darrin, I think we should talk.
You bet your sweet life we should talk.
Sam, it's through, finished.
Do you realize what I've been through today?
First, I was turned into a chimp.
Then I had to climb out of a window to avoid my boss.
Darrin, I know it's been very trying.
Trying?
Have you ever been hugged by Gladys Kravitz?
- And then I end up in the zoo.
- Darrin.
And then, to top it all off, I'm rejected by the other chimps.
- Darling, why?
- Why?
Who knows why?
Maybe, because of the suit, they think I'm a millionaire chimp.
Who knows?
I'm telling you one thing, Sam.
This is the last time that spooky family of yours is ever gonna make a monkey out of me.
Darling, I have something very important to tell you.
Samantha, this is important.
- I love you, but I can't go - Darrin, if you love me, you'll listen.
Listen to what?
I think you better sit down.
Okay, what's so important?
- I'm gonna have a baby.
- Good.
- You're what?
- I'm gonna have a baby.
- You're kidding.
- Honest.
I saw Dr. Anton this morning, and he said the test was positive.
I didn't tell you before, because I didn't want to get your hopes up.
Congratulations, Pop.
A baby.
Our very own baby.
Oh, Sam, that's Sam, that Sweetheart, I'll try to be the best father there ever was.
You will be.
Now, let's go home.
They want to congratulate me.
No, I don't think so.
I think they just want to say goodbye.
Then I'll say goodbye.
What's the matter?
Sam, will we have a little witch?
Well, it might be a little warlock.
There's no other choice?
On the other hand, it might be a plain, lovable mortal baby.
But you don't have any advance information?
Darrin, I'm a witch, not a fortune-teller.
We'll just have to wait and see.
- Oh, I can hardly wait.
- Neither can I. Hurry up, sweetheart, we'll be late.
Coming.
- You like?
- I like.
- Now we got two things to celebrate.
- What?
Our first wedding anniversary and our first future baby.
- All right, I'm ready to celebrate.
- Oh, wait a second.
I love you too.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Hello.
I wondered if you knew anything about the chimp I caught here today.
- Chimp?
- Yes.
Cute little thing.
He was wearing a tuxedo and a golf cap.
Yes?
Go on, Mrs. Kravitz.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Hi, there.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
I didn't mean to wake you up.
That's okay.
I have to get up anyway.
Mother's popping in.
Have you told her the news about the baby yet?
- Well - Sam.
I've been sort of putting it off.
How do you?
- How do you think she'll take it?
- I don't know.
Somehow Mother doesn't strike me as the grandmother type.
Well, she's just gonna have to get used to it.
Now, you lie down for another hour.
I'm making breakfast.
But I'm not the least bit tired.
Expectant mothers are always tired.
Why fight it?
But I'm not.
Really.
Now, honey, take it easy.
- You'll aggravate those back pains.
- I don't have any.
I'll get something for the morning sickness.
- I don't have morning sickness.
- Don't do that, honey.
I'll make the bed.
You mustn't strain yourself.
All right, Darrin.
But I'm fine.
Really I am.
I don't have any of the usual symptoms of pregnancy.
Not one.
Well, maybe one.
Oh, honey.
I was hoping you'd stay in bed.
- I was bringing up your breakfast.
- That's sweet but I don't want you cooking and cleaning up after me.
And I don't want you lifting a finger around here.
- How cute.
- You like that, huh?
Now, you come on over here and take the load off our baby's feet.
Darrin, you're gonna spoil me.
Well, I already spoiled your figure, I might as well spoil the rest of you.
And here we are.
There's orange juice for vitamin C. Hot cereal for protein.
And milk for good, strong bones.
And last but not least the food most important to an expectant mother's diet: Marvellous.
Honey, I think I've got a pretty good schedule figured out.
- What for?
- Well, to help Where are you going?
- For the butter.
- Oh, the butter.
I forgot.
Sit down.
Darrin, how can I convince you that I'm perfectly capable of doing these things?
I'm not an invalid, I'm just expecting.
Sweetheart, I wouldn't be acting like this if you were just expecting but we're positive.
- Now, you promise to take it easy.
- All right, Darrin.
If it'll make you happy, you can do all the work.
But now you've got to promise me something.
Anything.
What?
When they wheel me into the delivery room, you let me take over.
Okay, you got yourself a deal.
Darrin?
Would you check these layouts on the Stanwyck account?
Yeah, sure, Larry.
Darrin?
I had two eggs for lunch that looked better than your eyes.
Well, I didn't get much sleep last night, Larry.
Having a baby is pretty rough on a guy.
Already?
You just found out you were gonna be a father.
- I know.
But - No buts, Darrin.
It's only rough if you let it get rough.
Louise just had a baby, remember?
So I've been through this diaper derby.
You know, some women will pull any trick in the book if they think they can get away with it.
Larry, I appreciate your interest, but there really isn't any problem.
Darrin, I'm only telling you this for your own good.
You've got to be firm with Sam.
Indifferent.
You know, stop all this catering to her.
Okay, Larry.
After I cook dinner tonight, I'll flatly refuse to mop the floor.
Go ahead, make jokes.
But I've read up on this motherhood routine.
Actually, a well-known doctor has written a book on the subject: The Joy of Labour for Labour's Sak e. The more active the mother, the more she does for herself the happier she'll be and the healthier the child.
- Really?
- Well, it makes sense if you stop to think about it.
In the pioneer days women used to plough the fields, have kids on their lunch break and go on ploughing again.
- They did, didn't they?
Well, take my own wife, Louise.
She played golf the day before she had the baby.
- Golf?
- Of course it ruined her backswing.
Darrin, you must force yourself to be sensible.
And that's just what you should do.
- Larry, I just couldn't.
- You want a happy wife, don't you?
- Naturally.
- You want a healthy child, don't you?
- Of course.
- Well, then at least try it for their sake.
Maybe I should.
Mother?
Samantha, how could you?
You know.
I was hoping that it was just an ugly rumour.
Mother, aren't you pleased?
You're gonna be a grandmother.
That's right.
That's right, twist the knife.
Give me just one good reason why I shouldn't have children.
Don't you see?
You'll be tied to that mortal oaf indefinitely.
That's what I want.
Oh, Samantha, you just don't understand.
He's turning you into the typical housewife drudge.
Oh, I can just see you in a few years surrounded by diapers and bottles and pacifiers.
And wall-to-wall babies.
Mother, tell me something honestly.
Aren't you just a teeny-weeny bit pleased you're going to have a grandchild?
Honestly, now.
Will you let me play with the child whenever I want?
With absolutely no responsibility?
You promise never to call me "Granny"?
If that's what you want.
Well, it might be a bit diverting.
- I insist on one thing though.
- What's that?
That you won't do this the hard way.
Promise me you'll use a little witchcraft to make it easy for you while you're expecting.
You know how I feel about that, Mother.
I wanna be like any mortal woman having a baby.
I want to enjoy every wonderful moment.
Oh, Samantha, I will not have you slaving away while you're expecting my grandchild.
You are pleased.
Well, the least he can do is to get someone to help you with the heavy work.
Darrin can't do enough for me.
He's very sweet and considerate and won't let me lift a finger when he's here.
I can imagine.
- Sam, I'm home.
- The voice of the turtle.
In here, sweetheart.
You'll see.
He'll be furious that I'm cooking dinner.
He thinks I should be resting.
- Hi, honey.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- I was just starting dinner.
- Oh, good.
I've had a hard day.
I think I'll rest until it's ready.
He certainly is considerate.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothing, dear.
- How is everything going?
- Will you put this on the stove for me?
Well, do it yourself, Sam.
The exercise will do you good.
The prosecution rests its case.
Would you mind getting the corn out of the vegetable bin?
I don't like to do too much bending.
A little bending is good for you.
Strengthens the stomach muscles.
- Darrin, what's gotten into you?
- Nothing.
Give me a yell when dinner's ready, huh?
Fix your own dinner.
Why don't you put a couple of pounds of lead in each pocket?
Lt'll toughen up her legs.
She's my wife and I know what's best for her.
Well, she's also my daughter and I think you've been treating her very shabbily.
Especially at a time like this.
I happen to have done a little research on the subject.
A very well-known doctor has a new theory on childbirth and I happen to agree with him wholeheartedly.
If you let a woman do it, she'll make a career out of childbirth.
I'm doing this for Sam's good.
Believe me, I know every ache and pain that she has and it hurts me more than her.
- It doesn't yet.
But it will.
- I beg your pardon?
Never mind.
Wake up.
Wake up, Darrin.
Up, up.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
How do you feel?
Well, not that good.
My stomach's a bit queasy.
What's the matter?
Well, suddenly I got a backache.
Must have slept funny.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I feel awfully tired this morning though.
What's the matter?
My pyjama pants feel kind of tight.
Well, I'll get shaved.
You know, I feel like having something real crazy for breakfast this morning.
Me too.
Darrin, they're waiting in the conference room.
All right.
Don't rush me.
Martin's not the kind of man to keep waiting.
- Well, what's so important about him?
- His soap.
It means half a million dollars a year to this company.
Money, money.
Is that all you think about?
Of course.
What else is there?
A person's feelings, that's what else there is!
My feelings.
I'm doing the best I can, Larry.
I'm a human being.
I'm not a machine.
- Darrin, what's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
- You're crying.
- I'm not crying.
Why are your eyes all moist?
Probably the sunlight.
Besides, I have hay fever.
The blinds are drawn and you never had hay fever before.
All right, so I'm crying.
I am crying.
So what?
A person has the right to have a good cry once in a while.
- Darrin, I didn't mean to upset you.
- That's all right, Larry.
It's all right.
I'm just I'm just all worn out.
- Wanna talk about it?
- About what?
Well, whatever it is that's making you behave this way.
Behave what way?
Well, fidgety, nervous.
I don't know, Larry.
I've been this way ever since I got up this morning.
Then skip the conference.
I can handle Martin alone.
- No.
- But, Darrin, if you don't feel well No, Larry.
No, I'm all right now.
I can handle it.
Darrin checked these over yesterday and I feel the Stanwyck account will go for this approach.
Phil, are you gonna eat your pickle?
- Oh, here.
Help yourself.
- Thanks.
If I can suggest a change, I think we ought to accent the product itself rather than the copy.
It'd be more of an eye-catcher that way.
- Larry, are you gonna eat your pickle?
- No.
Now, I think that we've touched all the bases.
Unless you'd like to add something, Mr. Martin.
Well, it's just a notion.
I'm inclined to agree with Larry.
Mr. Martin, are you gonna eat your pickle?
Yes, I am.
I'd like to see the product a little larger.
Like it was jumping out of the ad at you.
Exactly.
It would have more impact that way.
You're not eating it.
I'll eat it when I feel like it.
If you don't want it, there's no sense letting it go to waste.
Darrin.
- It's his pickle.
- But it's just lying there.
- So it's just lying there.
- Then why can't I have it?
Darrin.
You have no intention of eating that pickle.
Now, look, we're not gonna have an argument about a pickle.
- I demand your pickle!
- Darrin.
Gentlemen, if you'll excuse us for a moment.
- Sorry, Mr. Martin.
- Darrin.
What on earth got into you?
I don't know.
It was like some kind of crazy fixation.
I just had to have his pickle.
Darrin, I think your wife's having a baby is really getting to you.
- You're like one big peeled nerve.
- That's how I feel.
Why don't you take the rest of the day off.
Go see a doctor?
Get him to give you a tranquilizer?
Maybe I should.
I just haven't been myself all day.
I'll see you in the morning.
Get a good night's sleep.
Easy on the back, Lar.
Well, blood pressure's normal, Darrin.
In fact, everything's normal.
Well, that's good.
There must be something wrong.
You can put your shirt on now.
Tell me what did you do today that might have had an upsetting effect on you?
Well, when I woke up this morning I had an upset stomach.
Then when I got out of bed I suddenly had the darnedest backache.
Backache, eh?
Anything else?
Then I had a sudden urge for something crazy to eat.
- Such as?
- Ice cream, watermelon, sardines.
I got into an argument with a fellow at the office over a pickle.
- A pickle?
- I shouldn't have got upset about it - But, well, he wasn't eating it.
- I see.
Does that add up to anything, doc?
Not in your case, but I'd say that if you were a woman that you were going to have a baby.
Now that you mention it, it does sound like It doesn't yet.
But it will.
- Endora.
- Endora?
My mother-in-law.
It's nothing.
I hope.
Mr. Stephens' office.
Oh, good afternoon, Mrs. Stephens.
Mr. Stephens wasn't well this morning.
How is he feeling this afternoon?
Not well, I'm afraid.
He went to see the doctor.
- Doctor?
What's the matter with him?
- I'm not sure.
He was quite strange.
In fact, he got into an argument with an important client over a pickle.
- A pickle?
- You know what he wants for a snack?
Pickled herring and a strawberry sandwich?
Anything else?
A backache?
Have him call me as soon as he comes back.
Thanks.
Mother?
I would've been here sooner, darling, but I was in Rome.
What did you do to Darrin?
Just teaching him a little lesson for the way he treated you last night.
- There was a reason for that.
- I know, I know.
He read a book.
Believe it or not, he was only thinking of me.
I'll thank you to stop your meddling and take that crazy spell off Darrin.
Not until I'm ready, darling.
Now, if you'll excuse me there's somebody waiting for me on the Via Veneto.
You Mother?
Dave, I've got a problem.
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna have a baby.
Yeah, I've made up my mind.
This is one boy who's going to stay single-o.
There's only going to be one control on my electric blanket.
How could she do this to me?
- What will the neighbours say?
- I don't know one happy couple.
Sure, my cousin Irving says he's had four years of happy marriage but he's been married to Selma for 17 years.
What'll I tell everybody at the office?
You can't keep a thing like that a secret for too long.
- People start to notice.
- And what's Irving got to show for it?
A stack of bills, that's what.
He's engaged to Selma all through high school all through college, and the day they get married she tells him she was in the half of the class that had all the cavities.
What will I say to Sam?
"Guess what, dear, we're gonna have babies together"?
No, sir.
They're not shoving me down that middle aisle.
Hey, I gotta go.
Well, glad I could help, Darrin.
- You all right, Mr. Stephens?
- All right?
Joe, I'm gonna have a baby.
Oh, yeah?
Congratulations to the wife.
- Not my wife.
Me.
- You?
Yes.
I'm going to be a mother.
Well, that's great.
You'll be the first man in the world to pull it off.
You'll be famous.
Yeah, I'll be famous.
Fill it up again, Joe.
I never thought of that.
I'll be famous.
I'll be famous.
I'll be famous.
I'll be famous.
I can't stand this waiting.
Mrs. Stephens?
Your husband had a boy.
Both father and son are doing just fine.
A boy?
A boy.
It's a boy.
It's a boy.
It's a boy.
You realize you're the first man in the world to have a baby?
Yes.
And they said it couldn't be done.
You seem most pleased about it.
Oh, yes.
My wife and I both wanted a large family.
And this way we can have twice as many kids.
- How is your wife taking this?
- Just great.
Not the least bit jealous.
She made some of her old clothes into maternity sport coats for me.
Do you have any immediate plans?
Not at the present.
Just rest.
Get my figure back.
I suppose you have big plans for your first child?
Yes, indeed.
But it could cause a bit of a problem.
In what way?
Well, as his father, I'd like him to go into politics but as his mother, I'm against it.
I'll be famous.
I'll be famous.
I'll be famous.
Are you sure you're all right, Mr. Stephens?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, Joe.
- Darrin.
- Oh, Sam.
I had a feeling you'd be here drowning your sorrows.
Am I glad to see you.
Darling, I think you've had enough.
Let's go home.
Honey, I'm not drunk.
I've got something to tell you.
- Yes, I know.
- Oh, no, you don't know.
Now, listen to me.
I'm going to have a baby.
- Mother told me.
I know all about it.
- I'll have to have my pants let out.
Darling, they're only symptoms.
We'll be rid of them soon enough.
- Really?
- Yes, sweetheart.
I hope so.
I've had a terrible day.
I know, sweetheart.
Come on.
Come on.
Oh, hello there.
I didn't see you come in.
How about that character that just left?
- I'll bite.
How about him?
- Well, didn't you hear him?
He thinks he's going to have a baby.
Isn't that wild?
Not necessarily.
Why, it's the most ridiculous thing I ever heard of.
I've got five kids.
Another one on the way right now.
Why, it's a snap.
Nothing to get shook up about.
Imagine a guy thinking he's gonna have a baby.
- Suddenly I got a backache.
- You don't say.
Hope it goes away by tonight.
I'm supposed to go bowling.
I wouldn't advise that in your condition.
Here you are, sweetheart.
Just a little something to keep your strength up.
You didn't have to do that.
I could've done it.
No chance.
I'm back to spoiling you rotten.
- How do you feel?
- Great.
But if that mother of yours ever pulls a stunt like that again I'm gonna use a little magic of my own.
- Make a few of her teeth disappear.
- And no jury will convict you.
Now, is there anything else I can get you?
Darrin, we have a long way to go.
If you keep this up you'll be awfully tired by the time the baby's born.
Don't argue.
Eat.
Eat.
Seriously, darling, you can't go on waiting on me like this.
I'm not an invalid.
I feel perfectly fine.
Sam, don't try to tell me how you feel.
I know how you feel.
Exactly.
- Remember?
- Yes.
- Come to think of it, you do.
- That's right.
- I'm a man in a million.
- So big deal.
I've always known that.
Cheers.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Well, I certainly appreciate your letting me stay here.
I'll try not to be too much bother.
We're glad to have you, Adam.
It'll be like old times.
Not quite, Darrin.
The food we had in the Army was never like this.
Why, thank you.
You can stay as long as you like.
Well, actually, it won't be more than a couple of days.
I have an appointment for a job tomorrow and if I land it, I'll be looking around for a place of my own.
Adam, what made you decide to change jobs and come out here?
Well, frankly, Darrin, I don't know.
One afternoon, I suddenly had this overwhelming urge to come here.
I handed in my resignation right there and then.
It's kind of funny, though.
I really was fairly settled in Salem.
Salem?
You're from Salem?
- You know it?
- Only by reputation.
Well, my family has lived there for 300 years.
You know, this is really very good.
How did that happen?
My goodness.
Here, don't worry about it.
Here, let me do that.
- I'm awfully sorry.
- No, that's all right.
Adam, try the wine.
It's really very good.
To Company D. Oh, yes, sirree, I'll drink to that.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
Here.
Here, mop it up with this.
- I'm not usually so uncoordinated.
- That's all right.
- No harm done.
- Well, I'm sorry.
- I'll get you some fresh wine.
- Thank you.
- Are you all right, Adam?
- Oh, well, I think so.
All right.
Now, you just relax.
I'll go and get the main course.
So strange.
I'll help you.
Look, Sam, just because Adam happens to comes from Salem is no reason to victimize him.
I didn't have anything to do with those accidents.
- You didn't?
- No.
Endora.
Endora, where are you?
- Mother's in the south of France.
- Really?
Well, I guess Adam's just one of those people who's accident prone.
Help!
Help!
Adam, what happened?
I know this doesn't make sense, but the salad attacked me.
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara?
Well, I've heard of coming in on a wing and a prayer but, really, this is ridiculous.
Now, where is the young man that you're so worried about?
Oh, Adam Newlarkin.
He's gone to his interview.
Aunt Clara, it's getting worse.
It's getting worse.
Last night, he fell out of bed three times.
And this morning, when he was shaving, he cut his toe.
Cut his toe?
He dropped his electric razor on it.
Now, I hope I'm wrong, but he has all the symptoms so I thought we'd better check.
Yes, well Well let us see now.
- What's his name?
- Newlarkin.
Adam Newlarkin.
Yes.
Yes.
He has a spell on him, all right.
- Oh, Aunt Clara, are you sure?
- Oh, yes.
He's right here on the list of spellees.
Right between the New York Mets and Richard Nixon.
Evidently one of his ancestors also named Adam Newlarkin, was a judge in Salem.
He sentenced a witch named Zorelda to some terrible things that included being dunked three times in the local pond.
What's the spell?
Oh, it's Oh, this is terrible.
Look.
That's a lulu, isn't it?
Poor Adam.
It's no good shaking your head, Darrin.
Tomorrow, Adam will be exactly the same age as the judge when he sentenced Zorelda.
- Oh, Sam - Believe me.
Believe me, that spell will take effect by 5 p.m. Tomorrow.
It's all here in red and white.
Just because it's written in some crazy Red and white?
It's thicker than ink.
Sam, let me see it.
What it boils down to is that by 5 p.m. Tomorrow afternoon Adam is gonna steal a large sum of money and be branded a common thief.
That's ridiculous.
Adam is one of the most honest men I know.
Besides, he doesn't even come in contact with actual money.
Hi, everybody.
Well, congratulations are in order.
- I got a job.
- Well, good.
- At the Peterson Company?
- No.
That one fell through.
- Where then?
- At a bank.
A bank?
How did you happen to get a job there?
Well, Darrin, I found myself running out of money, so I went to a bank.
I started talking to the bank manager and he told me they needed an accountant.
I suppose you'd call it fate.
Is that what you'd call it, Darrin?
Well, I start tomorrow morning.
I'd better go upstairs and wash up before dinner.
Adam, I don't understand.
You never worked at a bank before.
Well, I know.
But I thought it might be fun to handle all that money.
Convinced?
What can we do about it?
Aunt Clara has gone home to try and see if she can find a book of antidotes.
We'll just have to put all our confidence in her.
Oh, dear.
This all has to be done within a 12-hour period.
Well, here we go.
"Must kiss a spotted dog on the snout, then the spell will be partly out.
Must be dunked in the water one times three but part of the spell still clings to thee.
The spell will be over when, like Paul Revere he rides through the marketplace yelling, 'Witches are good, witches are dear"!
' Well, it won't win any prizes for poetry but it'll do the job, I think.
I've heard and seen some strange things since we've been married but this is the wildest.
That's right out of the middle ages.
Do we really have to make Adam do all that?
Darling, we can't risk not making him do it.
Nobody is going to kiss a spotted dog on the snout and be dunked in the water of his own free will.
Well, I guess we're just going to have to do it the hard way.
Morning, Darrin.
- Hey, where'd the dog come from?
- He belongs to a neighbour.
- Hey, he likes you, Adam.
- I guess he does, doesn't he?
- Hi, fella.
- Why don't you kiss him?
- What?
- Give him a kiss on the snout.
No kidding.
He really likes that.
Well, I think I'll take a rain check on that, Darrin.
- Good morning, Adam.
- Morning, Samantha.
- Time to eat?
- Not until you kiss the spotted dog.
It's sort of a tradition.
We do it every morning for luck.
- Before breakfast?
- Why, certainly.
It's your turn first this morning, isn't it, darling?
Yes, sweetheart.
Now you can eat breakfast.
And now I can eat breakfast.
- What was that?
- What was what?
I heard music.
That was the toaster.
We have a musical toaster.
Thank you.
Adam, how would you like to have lunch with me today?
Oh, well, Darrin, thanks, but it's my first day at the bank All the more reason to celebrate.
Right, darling?
Right.
I insist.
Well, all right.
Where shall we meet?
At the Inn on the Terrace.
You eat outside.
I know you'll like the place.
Great food.
And it has a beautiful swimming pool.
- Darrin.
- Adam.
- How's the job going?
- Oh, fine, fine.
- Which is our table?
- It's a beautiful pool, isn't it?
Yeah, I guess it is.
Darrin, I don't have very much time.
Adam, what's that written on the bottom of the pool?
Written on the bott?
- I don't know.
- Right there.
Well, I don't see anything on the bottom of the pool.
Here, you got It's way, way down there.
See?
- Well, I don't see anything.
- Right there.
That little green thing Are you all right?
You must have slipped.
- I felt something push me.
- Well, I don't see anything.
- Well, help me out, will you, Darrin?
- Yeah.
Thanks.
Good.
Thanks.
Okay.
I'll get you a towel.
Waiter!
I don't think that's funny!
I couldn't help it, Adam.
I just couldn't hold you.
You deliberately let me go.
- No, l - Yes, you did!
- And before that, you pushed me!
- No, I couldn't hold you.
Yes, you did!
And I'll tell you one other thing.
There is no writing at the bottom of that pool!
I'd swear there's something down there.
Sam, we're one dunking short, and I don't see how I can manage it.
- Where is he now?
- He's changing.
I hope you're right about this, because I feel like an idiot.
Darrin, we have to get him wet once more.
I don't know how I can swing it.
I don't think I can get him to go near the water, much less push him That button next to the thing, honey.
I'm sure it'll work.
I gotta go now.
I got a spare suit from the manager.
Well, it wasn't exactly from Savile Row.
- Adam, your lunch.
- Thanks.
Guess you're pretty sore, huh?
- Darrin, can I ask you a question?
- Well, fire away.
How long have you been going around kissing dogs' noses and pushing people into swimming pools?
I mean, what kind of a practical joker have you become anyway?
I wish I could be there to help Darrin.
But Adam knows me.
I don't understand, dear.
Well, after being pushed in the pool twice by Darrin Adam is not likely to get near the water with me.
Could I lend a helping hand?
Yes.
Yes, Aunt Clara, I think you can.
Think you can manage it?
Relax, dear.
I'll take care of everything.
Concentrate, Clara.
Concentrate.
Adam, I've said I'm sorry.
What else can I say?
All right.
Let's just forget it.
I just don't want to go into that pool again.
Old lady over there seems to be having trouble.
What old lady?
- Oh, well, I'll give her a hand.
- I'll go with you.
No, no, no.
Stay there.
- May I help you, madam?
- Oh, thank you, young man.
Here, I'll get it.
Oh, here.
- Oh, yes.
- This one Isn't that nice?
They're playing his song.
We're into the home stretch, dear.
I don't see how we're gonna get him to put on that Paul Revere costume and ride through the town square by 5:00.
Oh, yes, now, don't you worry.
Samantha, she'll manage everything.
Where there's a witch, there's a way, you know.
Excuse me, Mr. Harding.
How did you get that cold?
I know how I just wish I knew why.
Well, this is the season for them.
I'll be glad to get away to the sun for a couple of weeks.
- You leaving tonight?
- No, this afternoon.
Mr. Abercrombie's letting me go early so I can catch the 5:00 flight to Rio.
Now, is there any question about this procedure?
No, no.
I think I understand it.
But I feel fine.
Adam, Mrs. Stephens has told me about your little mishap in the pool.
She's very worried about that cold of yours.
- But it's nothing.
- Now, look, Adam I realize you hesitate to ask for time off on your first day at work and I appreciate your conscientiousness but I insist that you go home.
- Mr. Ab - Adam, that's an order.
It's nice to have seen you again.
Remember me to your husband.
- I certainly will.
Thank you.
- Thank you, Mr Adam, I'm sorry I had to go over your head, but it's for your own good.
I know you're going to be a mother but would you please practice on somebody else.
Adam, will you please hurry up?
All right, all right.
I'm coming, I'm coming.
Well, goodbye, Mr. Harding.
- Have a nice vacation.
- The best I ever had.
- I've always wanted to go to Rio - Adam.
Well, what is this all about?
We're all going to a costume party.
At 4:30 in the afternoon?
We're going for dinner.
Your Paul Revere costume is on your bed upstairs.
And your horse is outside.
My horse?
What horse?
We thought it'd be fun for you to ride over.
- Well, you'd better hurry up.
- Now, wait a minute!
Wait just a darn minute!
I want to I recognize that lady.
I'm Whistler's mother.
Whistler's mo?
Look, I wanna know what all this is about.
What all this what is about?
I get up this morning, you make me kiss a spotted dog on the nose.
Okay, some people have quirks, so I went along with it.
But then I was pushed into a swimming pool with all my clothes on.
- Adam - No, no, let me finish!
I was pushed twice by you and once by Whistler's mother!
And then I am dragged out of my office and told to get into a Paul Revere costume and to get on a horse.
Now, I'm not going to move from this spot until I know why.
Adam, I promise I will explain it all to you tonight.
Right now, you just do as we say.
Why?
Because if you don't you'll be branded as a common thief.
- What for?
- For stealing money from the bank.
I feel like I've just stepped through the looking glass.
I know it's hard to understand, but it's true.
Okay.
Okay, so I stole some money.
Well, where is it?
Is it in my suit?
Is it under my hat?
Is it in my briefcase?
Now do you believe us?
This isn't my briefcase.
I must have picked up the wrong one.
- I have to get it back.
- No, no, Adam.
I'm sorry, but it's too late.
- You're gonna have to do it our way.
- Your way?
Yes, you go upstairs, put on that Paul Revere costume get on that horse, ride through the market yelling: "Witches are good, witches are dear"!
- What?
- Witches are good, witches are dear!
I'm afraid we're gonna have to tell him.
- Tell me what?
- Well, we've tried everything else.
Tell me what?
Adam, you're bewitched and you only have 10 minutes to get unbewitched.
You see, it's like this: One of your ancestors, Judge Adam Newlarkin sentenced the witch Zorelda to be dunked in a pond three times.
And she put a spell on him.
Two months later, he robbed a bank.
Aunt Clara has a book that has all that information.
Lucky for you, she also knows the antidote.
Now, that's why we had you kiss the spotted dog on the snout.
Snoot.
Nose.
And that's why we pushed you into the pool because you had to be dunked three times.
And that's why we want you to go upstairs and put on that Paul Revere costume and get on the horse that's tethered It's the only way.
And Adam Adam, where are you going?
I wanna get into my Paul Revere costume.
You mean you believe us?
Of course I believe you.
I'm from Salem.
I hope he's a good rider.
He only has nine minutes to make it to the shopping plaza.
Normally, we wouldn't have discovered the loss until Monday but by some strange chance, Miss Thompson decided to run a Well, I won't go into details.
The money is missing.
Now, what do we do?
First, we'll run a routine check on all the employees.
Their homes, so forth.
- Then we'll - Witches are good, witches are dear!
Witches are good, witches are dear!
Witches are good, witches are dear!
Witches are good, witches are dear!
Witches are good, witches are dear!
Witches are good, witches are dear!
I suggest we check his house first.
I'm sorry to keep you people from your party but it's necessary that we question Mr. Newlarkin.
He should be here in a few minutes.
He went to the plaza for something.
- Is this his briefcase?
- Well Well, I I'm sure Adam would be happy to open it for you when he returns.
We don't have to wait for that.
Well, here he is now.
I did it!
I did it!
Was I in time?
You were on time.
- What was that music?
- That was the doorbell.
Newlarkin, I'd like to ask you a few questions.
Excuse me.
Hello?
It's for you.
Lieutenant Pearson.
Oh, I see.
Well, thank you.
One of my men from the airport.
They picked up an Albert Harding.
He had $75,000 in his briefcase.
Harding?
- But he's been with us for 20 years.
- Well, it's the same old story.
Boarding a plane to Rio.
I apologize for the intrusion.
- I'll see you on Monday, Adam.
- Yes, sir.
- Have a nice party, everybody.
- Goodbye.
Empty.
You know, it's a funny thing.
Ever since I was a little kid my grandmother has been telling me all sorts of stories about witches.
But I was always too embarrassed to ever admit that I believed in them, you know?
I never would have thought that you'd go in for that sort of thing, Darrin.
Are you kidding?
Some of my best friends are witches.
Aunt Clara, Adam was curious about why you collect doorknobs.
Oh, that's easy.
Because they're there.
Honey, how about some coffee?
Sam.
Sam.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart, I didn't hear you.
Well, that book of spellees must be pretty interesting.
Well, it ought to be.
It was banned in Boston.
Have you got to Darrin's name yet?
My name?
My name is in there?
Now, just a minute.
Yes, here it is.
Right there.
See?
Oh, well, what does it say?
It says you're going to marry a witch and live happily ever after.
- Does it really say that?
- No.
But it's true.
I'm a witch, and I know.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
- Who would be phoning at this hour?
- I don't know.
Hello.
This is Larry Tate.
No.
No, we're not back from Europe.
I'm calling you from London.
Louise and I need your help.
Sure, Larry.
What can we do?
Take care of your baby?
Yes.
Until Louise and I get back.
We just received word that our governess has been taken ill.
I understand.
Now, don't you worry.
Sam and I will get the baby right away.
Abner!
Abner!
Wake up, wake up.
Wake up!
Wake up!
It's an emergency!
- What?
- The Stephens.
He just put her in the car, and they drove off at top speed.
- I bet she's gonna have her baby.
- That's impossible.
She's only been pregnant three months.
Now go back to bed, Gladys, and let me sleep!
Abner!
Abner!
Hey, Abner, she's back.
With the baby.
You shouldn't make that meat loaf if it gives you dreams like this.
I'm not dreaming.
Be reasonable, Gladys.
Ever hear of a woman going to the hospital giving birth and bringing her baby home in less than two hours?
But I tell you, there is a baby.
I just saw it.
I got mugged in the Tunnel of Love.
Isn't he cute?
- Darrin, I wouldn't do that.
- Why?
They say that baby talk isn't good for babies.
Say, young fellow, what's your feeling about the income-tax situation?
Mine too.
I think he's just hungry.
I'll go get his bottle.
And I'll go to work.
I'll be back early to help you take care of young Mr. Tate.
So long, fella.
- Hi.
- Well, good morning, Mrs. Kravitz.
I saw you drive off in a big hurry last night.
Yes.
It was an emergency.
And you came home with a baby.
- That's right.
- Oh, how wonderful!
How much does it weigh?
About 25 pounds, I guess.
- Hello there.
- Good morning, madame.
I'm Mrs. Kravitz.
I live over there.
- Fascinating.
- Are you a relative?
- I'm Samantha's father.
- How wonderful!
I bet you've come to see the baby.
- Samantha's had a baby?
- Yes.
And after only three months.
Three months?
- Don't you find it rather strange?
- I certainly do.
It only took her mother 20 minutes.
I certainly am surprised to see you, Father.
I'm sort of surprised myself.
I've just heard the news about your having a baby.
I hope you're not upset over the idea of becoming a grandfather.
On the contrary, I'm delighted.
It'll be an entirely new experience for me.
And you know how I relish new experiences.
Yes, I know.
Tell me, what kind of education in witchcraft do you plan for the child?
- None.
- What?
- So far.
- That's shocking.
You can't put off anything as serious as that kind of training.
Of course, you know that a baby warlock has certain powers but they need to be developed to reach their full potential.
Well, yes, of course.
I know, Father.
You see, Darrin doesn't really approve of my teaching our baby witchcraft.
Darrin!
What prejudice!
What bigotry!
Typical mortal for you.
Maintain pride and ignorance and pass it on to the offspring!
Father, please calm down.
You see Oh, dear.
Let me fill this, and we'll talk more about it later.
Okay?
So you're my grandson.
I'm your grandfather, boy.
You may call me Maurice.
Speak up, speak up.
I can't hear you.
Your mother could talk when she was 4 hours old, in six languages.
Don't worry, lad.
I'll teach you to succeed in spite of your mortal father.
You're in for a little adventure, lad.
Come on, come on.
Let's go.
Father, I was Oh, my stars!
- Hello?
- Hi, sweetheart.
I called to find out how you're getting along with the baby.
Fine.
Just fine.
Is there anything I can bring home for him?
Milk, cereal, anything?
No.
- Darrin?
- Yes, darling.
Promise you'll stay calm?
You didn't drop him.
How could you think such a thing?
Well, you just said, "Be calm".
- Father came to see me.
- Father?
What did he do?
Well, I think he thought it was ours, and he took it somewhere.
Where?
Where?
That's the problem.
I don't know where.
You don't know?
You mean that baby might be?
You mean Larry Tate's baby right this minute might?
Sam!
That could mark a child for life.
I'll be home right away.
A taxi to the London airport, please.
Larry!
Larry, that man has our baby.
- Louise, are you out of your mind?
- I tell you, that was our baby.
How could it be?
You know he's at home with Samantha and Darrin.
Are you telling me I don't know my own child when I see him?
Oh, you know all babies look alike.
How dare you say such a terrible thing!
Louise, please.
You're causing a scene.
How can you think so little of your own son?
It wasn't him, I tell you.
Will you relax?
You'll be home pretty soon, and everything will be all right.
Beirut.
Istanbul.
Your father's always looking for the fun places.
He had no right to do it.
That kid doesn't even have a passport.
Hong Kong?
Possibly.
Possibly.
They copy his shirts so well.
I have a thought, Samantha.
You go east, and I'll go west.
Try the Riviera first.
He has an appetite for bikinis.
Good idea.
See you later, darling.
Try not to worry.
Try not to worry.
- Hello?
- Hello, Darrin?
This is Larry.
Larry who?
Good grief!
Larry Tate.
What's the matter with you?
Oh, Larry Tate!
Larry Tate.
Are you still in London?
No, no, we're home.
At the airport.
Just got through customs.
How's my son?
- Who?
- The baby!
The baby!
- Has he been giving you any trouble?
- Oh, no trouble at all.
It's as if he wasn't even here.
He's fine.
Well, we'll grab a cab and be right over to get him.
Don't do that, Larry.
You stay right where you are.
I'll come over and get you.
- That's very considerate of you, but - I'll leave right now.
Samantha.
Help!
My grandson, the warlock!
There's no resemblance to Samantha.
Favours her husband, eh?
- He's so cute.
- What can he do?
Okay, boy.
Now, let's show them what you've learned.
He's only had a few hours of training so far, you understand.
Now, son!
I brought him over here to get his education started on a firm foundation.
- Relax, boy.
Don't hurry anything.
- He's so cute.
Please.
Don't disturb his concentration.
- That's concentration?
- Please!
All right, boy, now we'll start with a little simple levitation.
You see that bottle of ale over there?
I want you to think.
Think it right over to you.
Keep thinking, boy.
I'll get it started for you.
You bring it the rest of the way.
He's pretty young, and it's difficult without practice.
All right, now, boy!
Remember the spell I taught you on the way over?
Okay, boy.
Produce your favourite toy.
You know, a nice little rattle.
There.
Good boy!
Fake!
I saw you materialize that, Maurice.
Maurice, the baby didn't do it.
You did.
I did no such thing!
Did I, grandson?
Too bad, Maurice.
The kid just hasn't got it.
But he has to!
He's my grandson.
I know.
Nanny Witch.
You can wait here for her.
She drops by every day for a quick one.
Don't worry, boy.
Nanny Witch will verify that you've got the stuff.
I sure miss the little fella.
- Can hardly wait to see him.
- I can imagine.
- Room for one more.
- There you are, Larry.
Oh, thanks.
It must be a faulty catch.
- I could use a little help, Darrin.
- Oh, sure.
Wait a minute!
- Find my laundry mark interesting?
- I've never s - Darrin, this case has to go in.
- Oh, sorry.
Where did I put the key?
Here we are.
Here, here.
Let me.
There you are, Larry.
- No!
Let me.
- No, no, no.
Just get in the car, Darrin.
I'm sorry.
But he's a lovely baby.
And I love him.
But he's mortal.
- Like his father.
- Are you sure?
He's only human.
But what am I to tell my friends?
Oh, shut up.
I'm the one who has cause to cry.
- What shall I do with him?
- Simple.
Feed him.
Okay.
Let's go.
Louise, how is London?
You enjoy yourself?
Darrin, we're in kind of a hurry.
Oh, thank you, Larry.
Funny.
It won't start.
Try turning on the ignition.
I'm glad the baby wasn't any trouble for you and Samantha.
I was worried sick about him.
You don't know the time I had.
She thought she saw a man with our baby in London.
You saw him in London?
On Westley Street, right in front of the hotel.
Darrin!
Look out!
Darrin, what is the matter with you?
I'm sorry, Louise, l What are you staring at?
Darrin, can we please go?
By the time I see my son, he'll be so old, he won't recognize me.
- Any luck?
- None.
- Me neither.
- I advised Duncan - Darrin!
- Oh, well, whatever it is.
I signalled for him to stall the Tates.
- How long he'll do that, I don't know.
- Poor dear.
I'd better help him.
I'll keep looking around the Orient.
We're running out of time.
Good luck, darling.
- What's the matter now?
- I hear a thumping under the hood.
- I don't hear anything.
- Well, I do.
It's taking longer to get from the airport to your house than it took to fly from London.
I'll check it, Louise.
Hi, sweetheart.
I just wanted to give you a progress report.
- Did you find the baby?
- Not yet.
We're running out of places to look.
Honey, I can't stall them much longer.
- Is he talking to someone?
- There's nobody out there.
Maybe he's talking to the motor.
Louise, nobody talks to a motor.
What's the trouble?
I'm checking.
I'm checking.
How about London?
Louise said something about seeing a man with her baby on Westley Street.
Westley Street?
London?
Oh, how can I have been so stupid?
Of course!
The Warlock Club.
You stall them just a little big longer.
- Couldn't we possibly get going?
- All right, Larry.
All right.
- Wait a minute.
- What?
What's the matter?
You've got lipstick on your face.
That's red oil.
In the shape of lips?
I guess you got me.
I was necking with Samantha under the hood.
Get in the car, Darrin.
- Keys - In the ignition.
Take the brake off.
Oh, Kendrick.
- Samantha.
How are you?
- I'm fine.
Has Father been here with a baby?
Yes.
Poor Maurice.
- My condolences, Samantha.
- Condolences?
- What happened?
Where is he?
- Who knows?
He was so upset by his grandchild's lack of talent that he departed in a fit of fury and frustration.
Oh, dear.
That wasn't his grandchild.
Do any of you know where I can find Father?
Oh, dear.
I've got to get back.
If you do see him, be sure and tell him to bring that child home immediately.
Louise!
Larry!
- Welcome back!
- I thought we'd never get here.
He drives at 10 miles an hour, doesn't even know his way.
- I'm calling a taxi to take us home.
- Well, that won't be necessary, Larry.
- Here's your coat.
- Oh, thank you.
I'll walk before I ever ride with you again.
How's my precious baby?
I'm sure he's fine.
Just fine.
- Fix them a drink.
- Good idea.
Not for me, thanks.
All I wanna do is hold my baby.
Where is he, Samantha?
Upstairs?
On second thought, I will have a drink.
What about the baby?
No use being overprotective with him.
He can wait.
Well, what the heck?
We've got to live too, right?
- What?
!
- I'll get the hors d'oeuvres.
You fix the drinks.
I'll help Sam.
- What are we gonna do?
- The only thing left: Tell the truth.
But, Sam What was that?
Here.
Serve these.
Here you are, Larry.
Eat hearty.
Father, I am furious with you.
He is hopeless.
Pure, unadulterated mortal.
I'll discuss it with you later.
Well, here you are, Louise.
Well, sit him over there.
- Hit me again, honey.
- Louise!
My baby.
Oh, my baby.
Oh, my precious.
Mommy and Daddy missed you so much.
- Did you get a cab?
- I sure did.
Come on, Louise.
Thanks, Samantha, for taking care of him.
And, Darrin, we really appreciate it.
Oh, well, any time.
We loved it.
- Didn't we, Darrin?
- Oh, yes.
It was quite an experience.
- Can I help you with the luggage?
- Thank you, Darrin.
That'd be a good On second thought, never mind.
This has been the most harrowing experience for me.
For you?
What about us?
The humiliation of learning that my grandson is not a warlock and now you're going to have another.
My first.
Father, that wasn't my baby.
No.
We were just taking care of him for my boss.
Our baby isn't due for months.
Are you sure?
Then there's still a chance.
Oh, what a relief.
Hello.
Hello.
- Here's a present for the baby.
- Oh, how sweet.
Should we open it now or wait until the baby arrives?
You mean you didn't have your baby last night?
But I saw a baby last night.
This morning, you told me there was a baby I thought you came to see the baby.
Yes.
I think you need this more than I do.
Well, ta-ta, Samantha.
- You too, Duncan.
- Darrin.
Right.
Darrin.
And don't forget.
I expect my grandson to be a warlock in the classic tradition.
How are we ever going to explain that?
We won't have to.
By the time she's finished that martini, she'll believe anything.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
I'm so sorry I'm late, but I ran into a slight headwind on my way back from Paris.
- Oh, Samantha, the table looks lovely.
- Thank you, Mother.
- Hi, Mom.
- How are you, Darrin?
- Darrin?
- The name is unfamiliar to you?
No, but I thought it was unfamiliar to you.
I'll make an agreement with you.
I'll try to remember your name if you promise never to call me "Mom.
" Why don't you open the wine, dear.
May I be of assistance?
- Mother.
- Yes?
Darrin can handle it very well by himself.
- I thought you agreed to be pleasant.
- Now, don't look at me.
I find your practical joke vastly unamusing.
My practical joke?
!
If you think I had anything to do with this, you flipped your cork.
Come now.
Come now, you two.
It must have been a slip-up at the bottling plant or something.
What's in the box?
A little something I brought for dessert.
I bought it in Paris this afternoon.
Mother, I didn't know Maxim's had a catering service.
Really, Samantha!
What's got into you?
- Well, Mother, I didn't do anything.
- Don't try to pin this on Sam.
It's perfectly obvious to me who the practical joker is.
Oh, how dare you?
I would never debase my abilities to do anything - Mother.
- What?
- Practical joker.
- Well, I fail to see what Oh, no!
Uncle Arthur.
Uncle Arthur?
Are you in there?
Sam.
Sam, what's going on?
- I'll explain to you in a moment.
- The serving dish.
I bet you're right.
Got you now, Uncle Arthur.
Forgive me for not rising, but I'm up to my neck in work.
Darrin, say hello to Uncle Arthur.
That's all I need, a practical-joking warlock.
I'm sorry.
I suppose I should've told you about Uncle Arthur, but Well, he's sort of the black sheep of the family.
I can understand why.
Now, I love him, despite his practical jokes.
He's my favourite uncle.
Do you know, when I was little, he taught me to make my first pony?
Honey, I don't care.
I don't want He what?
I was only 4.
I couldn't get the spell right.
I remember I got one horseshoe and the saddle, but I just couldn't Sam.
What are we gonna do about him?
Try and put up with his bad jokes and be nice to him.
Please.
Then I spent the summer hunting lions with a British expedition.
One morning I shot a lion in my pyjamas.
Now, what he was doing in my pyjamas, I'll never know.
- Cream, Darrin?
- Yes, please.
Help yourself.
Forgive me.
I just can't help milking a joke.
I really break you up, don't I?
Oh, don't be a party poop.
You got it, didn't you, Darrin?
Your brand of low comedy always did appeal to adolescent mentality.
- Mother!
What do you mean, "adolescent mentality"?
- I think it's fairly obvious.
- Now just a minute.
- I don't see - Mother, why don't you try the dessert.
- It's simply delicious.
- Thank you, dear.
- I got you that time.
- You certainly did.
Uncle Arthur, how could you?
Oh, Mother.
Darrin.
Darrin, get a towel.
It isn't funny.
Honey, I can't help it.
After all, I have an adolescent mentality.
So you have.
And you may as well look the part.
Now then, Ringo.
Laugh your head off!
Endora, come back!
Sam, make her come back.
You shouldn't have made fun of her, Darrin.
- Mother's very sensitive.
- She's sensitive?
You promised to make an effort.
Endora gives you a real hard time, huh?
In a word, yes.
Well, she always was a bit of a stick in the mud.
You gotta stand up to her, young fella.
No, thanks.
I have no desire to be turned into a toad.
There's another way to stop her.
I'll teach you a little magic of your own.
No, no, Arthur.
I'm mortal.
Well, nobody's perfect, Darrin.
Besides, down through history, many fine people have been humans.
Look, I just meant I can't perform magic.
Sure you can.
Nothing fancy, of course but enough to give her a jolt the next time she gets a little nasty.
No, thanks.
There's enough witchcraft in the family as it is.
No offence.
Please, let me teach you one little trick.
I'm very good with novices.
No, Arthur.
You see, Sam and I have an agreement.
No witchcraft.
We're going to live like normal people.
Your mother-in-law just turned you into Prince Valiant.
That's normal living?
I will not stoop to her methods.
We're going to cope with our problems my way.
Well, while you're at the barber shop, you better think it over, fella.
No, Arthur.
Absolutely no.
No witchcraft.
Enjoy your trip?
- Arthur.
- Did you reconsider?
Look, once and for all, no magic lessons.
- Now stop bothering me!
- Well, if at first you don't succeed nag, nag, nag.
Miss Grant, please send the Foster layout down to the conference room.
Yes, sir.
And Mrs. Stephens is on three.
Oh, thank you.
Hello, honey.
I can't talk long.
I have a presentation to make.
Now, this won't take long, Darrin.
Mother is here.
I just thought it might be a nice idea if you said a few words to her.
He won't apologize.
He still hasn't learned his lesson.
I heard that.
You can tell her I'm not a child who has to be taught a lesson.
And what's more, you can tell her that I can take anything she can dish out.
Better let me help you.
Talking to Endora that way is just asking for trouble.
Well, I can face any trouble she can give me like a man, not like a witch.
And will you please let me cope with things in my own way?
Who were you talking to?
The window washer.
Are you feeling okay?
Sure, fine.
Let's go.
Not exactly Jack Be Nimble today, are you?
I'll be fine if you'll just take this off my foot.
Thanks, Larry.
That should give you a general idea of our approach to your campaign.
Well, Stephens, I like it.
It feels bright, contemporary.
But I'm not clear on the television aspect of this thing.
It's very simple.
Our commercials will stress the utility of the EZ-Open Door.
Our model housewife will return from shopping her arms loaded with groceries, and with just a touch of her finger Just a slight What is it?
- It won't open.
- Of course it will.
What's the matter with you?
Anyone would think you're jinxed.
Jinxed.
Endora!
- What?
- Never mind.
You keep working.
I'll keep talking.
Mr. Foster, let me digress for a moment.
I would like you to re-examine the marketing figures.
- As you can see on this chart, we - Got it!
She's not gonna get away with it.
She's not going to ruin my life.
Offer's still good.
One shot, and you're the master of your own fate.
Come on.
Just one little spell.
That's all you need.
All right, I'll do it.
When do we start?
You've already started.
Now, the spell consists of two components.
First, the incantation.
It's in longhand.
Sorry, I couldn't resist.
You said the spell had two components.
Correct.
The incantation, which you have and these.
A cowbell and a duck call?
Are you putting me on?
Try to understand, Darrin.
You're only a mortal.
No offence.
But I don't see how a cowbell and a duck call is going to Darrin, for a mortal to work magic, he needs a little reinforcement.
In this case, it's sound effects.
You use the bell and the duck call at the end of each phrase of the incantation.
It's all marked out for you.
Go ahead, try it.
Don't be shy.
No, no.
Only, Darrin, you chant it.
Remember, it's an incantation.
I'll do it for you.
Now you try it.
- You're not listening.
- I'm not listening?
No I'm sorry.
I'll play it for you.
Now, you try.
That's right.
Now once more.
Wait, hold Wait.
Hold it.
Wait a minute!
Now, I never heard Sam or Endora or you ever say anything like that.
My dear boy, we don't have to say anything.
- We have the power.
- Even Aunt Clara doesn't use Look, I don't tell you about advertising so don't tell me about witchcraft, please.
- Fine.
- I hope so.
All right, once again.
And now, we'll add just a little movement.
- Cowbell.
- Cowbell.
Duck call.
That's it.
Once more.
Mother, I want you to be gracious about this.
I think it's very big of Darrin to apologize to you after all you've done to him.
What have I done to him?
If you'd like me to start at the beginning on our wedding night, you put him in the hotel lobby in his pyjamas.
- Then - I mean recently.
- How recently?
- Well, we won't go into that.
Oh, now, Mother.
You must've done something.
Darrin hasn't been himself all day.
Oh, how fortunate for you.
- Mother.
- Well, all right.
All right.
If he's willing to admit that his behaviour has been atrocious I guess I can forgive and forget.
You really think I can make this spell work?
I guarantee it.
You're easily the most talented mortal pupil I've ever had.
Now get in there and yaga-zoozie.
You're right.
The minute she opens her mouth to make one nasty remark I'm gonna let her have it.
- You're not coming in?
- Oh, I better not.
If Endora even suspected that I've been training you she'd nullify the spell even before you got started.
- I guess you're right.
- I'll be in here rooting for you, kid.
Here we go.
- Good evening, Endora.
- Hello, Dexter.
Darrin.
The name is Darrin.
I distinctly heard something jingle.
Did you now?
I heard it again.
So did I. Never mind.
It's probably the rattling of someone's adolescent mentality.
Darrin, you said you'd apologize.
Oh, and I will, sweetheart.
From now on, no more Mr. Nice Guy.
- All right, that's it!
You've asked for it.
- Darrin.
Sam, it's time your mother and I had this out.
- You've victimized me for the last time.
- Be careful, Tinker Bell.
Or what?
You'll do what, huh?
You'll do what?
Oh, you heard a jingle, huh?
Well, would you like to see it?
Well, I have it right here.
There.
How's that?
And that's not all.
How about this?
- How do you like that?
- You want a musical critique?
You're never gonna laugh at me again.
Darrin, what are you doing?
You said Don't try to stop me, Sam.
She's been asking for this for a long time.
Mother, have you been asking for that?
No, but I rather like it.
It swings.
Zoozie high!
Zoozie low!
Darrin, what's wrong?
- You're supposed to vanish.
- But I don't want to vanish.
I want to stay and see what you're going to do for your next number.
I I shouldn't have listened to him.
I just shouldn't have listened to him.
I should never have listened to him.
Something's terribly wrong.
Darrin?
And he went for it all the way.
Uncle Arthur.
Did you have something to do with the way Darrin acted?
Best Best joke I ever pulled.
Taught him magic spell.
With cowbells.
Didn't that break you up?
No, Uncle Arthur, it didn't.
I'll kill him!
That's what I'll do!
I'll kill him!
For once, I'm in sympathy with you but you'd never get away with it.
He plotted the whole thing, and I was fool enough to fall for it.
The chair, the door, the wastebasket!
I'll kill him with my bare hands!
I think I have a more practical solution.
- Poison?
- Yeah, yeah.
You'll have to help, Mother.
We're going to cure Uncle Arthur of his practical jokes once and for all.
You mean, you're willing to try it again?
Yes.
When the spell didn't work the first time I went upstairs and practiced.
And suddenly I felt Well, I felt this power.
I know I can make the spell work this time.
Oh, that's crackerjack.
When Endora walks in, let her have it again.
Oh, stop it, Uncle Arthur.
Tell Darrin the truth.
Admit you can't teach witchcraft to a mortal.
Samantha, please.
Do you want to destroy this boy's confidence?
Ignore her.
It's all right, sweetheart.
I've got the power.
I can feel it in here.
Kid, you've got a lot of heart.
Well, well, well.
Hello, Dexter.
Back for an encore, eh?
Enjoy your moment, Endora.
I'm through toying with you.
This is it.
- Oh, Darrin, not again.
- Stand aside.
I have the power now.
Prepare yourself, Endora.
I'm going to turn you into a parrot.
Oh, a parrot.
This is splendid.
He did it.
He did Did it?
But he can't.
You can't.
I mean, you couldn't.
I mean I mean, just don't stand there like a ninny!
Bring back Endora!
Make him bring her back, Sammie, before this gets serious.
Well, it is serious.
Darrin cast a spell and only he can remove it.
But he can't, because he doesn't know how.
Oh, Uncle Arthur, because of your practical jokes, Mother's a bird.
Hello, Durwood.
Hello, Dexter.
Darrin, you don't realize what you've done.
Endora can stay inside that parrot forever unless you bring her back immediately.
I don't see what you're so concerned about.
- You don't like her either.
- Of course I like her.
I love her!
Love her.
Love that parrot.
Oh, it's pathetic.
I don't get it.
You said yourself she was an interfering Oh, never mind what I said.
She's family.
Now please bring her back.
Please?
Hold tight, Endora.
I won't let this happen to you.
Now bring her back.
- Will you help, Uncle Arthur?
- Of course.
Anything.
Anything.
Will you stop playing those dreadful jokes?
Yes.
Any Endora!
But you I didn't know you cared, Arthur.
It was all a joke.
Well, it's not very funny.
That's the point.
We had to do it, Uncle Arthur.
Okay, Sammie, I guess I had it coming.
No more practical jokes, eh, Arthur?
I just went on the wagon two minutes ago.
A little going-away present.
Go ahead, open it.
Uncle Arthur, you wouldn't.
Oh, now, Sammie, how could you think such a thing?
No, you taught me my lesson last night.
No more jokes.
I'm a changed warlock.
Oh, Uncle Arthur, it's beautiful!
Thank you.
Please, no emotion.
I cry easily.
Darrin.
Oh, golf balls.
Well, thank you, Arthur.
I can always use these.
Didn't forget you, Endora.
Arthur.
You shouldn't have.
It wasn't necessary to get me a gift.
No, I wanted to give you something to remember me by.
Opera glasses.
Oh, Arthur!
- Oh, they're just exquisite.
- They're darling.
I can hardly wait to use them at La Scala.
Uncle Arthur, you promised you wouldn't.
I know.
I lied.
Okay, so I'll taper off.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
And over here, Sweet Osmanthus, African violets, gloxinias.
- Well, they're perfectly beautiful.
- Thank you.
I know I'm sometimes a bit of a bore about my hobby but before we discuss your advertising campaign l'd like to show you my pride and joy.
This is a black Peruvian rose.
- A Peruvian rose?
- Yes.
A Peruvian rose is very rare, but a black Peruvian rose is almost unheard of.
It took me nine years of experimental cross-pollination to produce this bloom.
Did you hear that, honey?
Sam, what's wrong?
- I feel a little strange.
- Strange?
- Dizzy.
I don't understand it.
- Call the doctor.
Don't worry, honey.
We'll get you right to the hospital.
You don't have to worry Well, don't just stand there, call a doctor.
- Darrin, I'll be all right.
- Don't be alarmed, Darrin.
A dizzy spell is to be expected when a girl is Has nothing to do with it.
People like her don't get sick.
Darrin!
- You feeling any better?
- About the same.
Now, don't worry, honey.
I'm sure it's nothing.
- You've never been sick before.
- I've never been pregnant before.
- Would you bring me the tray?
- I'm gonna call the doctor again.
But, Darrin, you called him - He'll call back as soon as he - No arguments.
What happened?
I have a feeling we're calling the wrong doctor.
You think we need a specialist?
A witch doctor.
My magic is on the blink.
Your witchcraft not working could mean there's something seriously wrong.
- Now, now, Darrin, don't be upset.
I'm just tired.
Maybe my execution of the spell was sloppy.
Sam, don't try to make me feel good.
Now, normally I'd be pleased if your witchcraft didn't work, but not if it means you're sick.
Try something else.
The window, try opening the window.
- Darrin.
- Sam, the window.
Go on.
That did it.
I'm calling the doctor.
What good would that do?
What are you gonna tell him?
- "My wife's witchcraft is out of whack"?
- Of course not.
But there's something wrong and I'll feel a lot better after he's checked you over.
Abner, a car just drove up in front of the Stephens'.
It's a doctor.
I can tell by his bag.
He went right in.
How about that?
Gladys, you were born - What do you mean by that?
- You'd have made a great town crier.
You think I should take over some of my chicken soup?
- No.
- Why not?
There's a city ordinance against poisoning people.
Darrin, try to relax.
Dr. Anton said I was just fine.
- We know better.
- Well Honey, I won't feel relaxed until you're completely back to normal.
How's your?
I don't know.
Let's see if I can put the window back together.
I'm beginning to understand how Aunt Clara feels.
- Sam, what can it possibly be?
- I don't know.
I wish Mother were here.
I bet she'd know something about all this.
Can't you concentrate, figure out where she is?
Nope.
I already tried.
When Mother wants to make herself scarce, nobody can find her.
Isn't there anyone else?
Well, there's Aunt Clara.
Can I come in?
I knocked at your front door, but I guess you didn't hear me.
- No, we didn't.
- Well, I didn't wanna knock very loud in case it would disturb you.
I saw the doctor drive up and I thought maybe a little chicken soup might - What's the matter?
- What's a door doing here?
- It leads to another room.
- Over the front lawn?
- Cantilevered.
- We're adding a nursery.
The room hasn't been built yet.
You mean, you put a door in the wall first?
How else would we get into the room to build it?
Thank you very much for bringing the chicken soup over, Mrs. Kravitz.
Well they always say chicken soup is always - What's the matter with her?
- I don't know.
I guess the poor woman's seen so many strange things she's probably - Sam, your face!
- What's the matter with it?
It's covered with spots.
Square green spots.
Square green spots all over her face, Abner.
- What do you think of that?
- So?
How can you be so calm?
Nobody ever had square green spots before.
Nobody ever had your chicken soup before.
Do you have any idea what's the matter?
I think her magic has gone to pot, and she's developed square green spots.
Aunt Clara, we thought maybe you'd know what disease I have.
Well, judging from the symptoms, I should think it's a square green spot disease.
- Is that serious?
- No, I don't think so.
It's inconvenient, and it lasts a whole year.
- A year?
- Yes.
Usually only witches in Peru get it.
Aunt Clara, we were looking at a Peruvian rose earlier.
Could that have had anything to do with it?
Was it a black rose?
Oh, dear.
That explains Explains everything.
You know, a Peruvian black rose was a part of the formula that they used to drive the witches out of Peru.
I didn't know they had witches in Peru.
Well, they haven't.
It worked.
Aunt Clara, you said the disease is not usually serious, but Sam's pregnant.
Oh, really?
Well, I've never known it to have that effect before.
Never.
Aunt Clara, Darrin wants to know if my having the disease while pregnant is serious.
Well, there's only one way to find that out: Ask a Peruvian witch who was pregnant when she got the square green spot disease.
Offhand, I think the chances of finding her is not too good.
Isn't there anything we can do?
Well, now, if I only had the right ingredients, I could whip up a brew that would get rid of it like that, you know.
- You could?
- Why, of course.
Darrin, now, would you mind running out and picking up some items I need?
- Of course not, Aunt Clara.
There's a drugstore in the neighbourhood, stays open all night.
Exactly what do you need, Aunt Clara?
Well, now, let me see.
I think you'd better make a list.
Well, now, let me see.
Two bat wings.
A half a pint of porpoise milk.
And be sure it's fresh.
Be sure it's fresh.
Four eye of newt.
And an ostrich feather.
One.
Yes, that's it.
You've got that, Darrin?
Yes, Aunt Clara, but where am I gonna get all these things?
Well, I'll give you the address of a little place that I shop.
Wilbur.
Wilbur, there's no use in sending me any more brooms.
I just can't move them.
The young witches today just wouldn't be caught dead on one.
Come in, come in.
Wilbur, let's face it, they just don't give a hang for tradition anymore.
No, I can't think of a thing I need, Wilbur except half a dozen tail of iguana.
Okay, no rush, Wilbur.
Well, what can I do for?
I suppose you're wondering about the phone?
Yes, I was.
Well, as a matter of fact, up till last week, I did use a crystal ball but then I finally decided to try the phone.
- Why fight progress, right?
- I guess so.
- Now, sir, what can I do for you?
- Oh, well, it's all right here.
Porpoise milk, porpoise milk.
- Please make sure it's fresh.
- Fresh?
Why, I milked the porpoise myself this morning.
Here we are.
Now, "four eye of" "Four of eye of" What's that?
"Newt".
I think.
Oh, yes, right over there in that jar.
Help yourself.
I find most of my customers like to pick out their own eye of newt.
Bat's wings, bat's wings.
You're sure you don't want the whole bat?
No, thanks, just the wings.
Would you believe it you know, you're the first customer I've had in here in days.
Business slow?
Witch-supply business just ain't what it used to be.
Nowadays everybody uses them instant spells.
Just one quick incantation, it's all over.
- Now, is that gonna be all?
- One ostrich feather.
Oh, I am sorry.
We're fresh out of ostrich feathers.
Now, where did I put my abacus?
Here we are.
I've just got to get an ostrich feather.
He tried to steal your what?
My ostrich feather.
Came right up to me on the street and said: "I want your feather".
Sergeant, I offered to buy her feather.
We'll get to you later.
Go on.
Well, I said I had no intention of selling my feather.
And then I started to leave.
But he followed me.
I see.
Okay, what's your story?
Well, sergeant, I know my behaviour must seem very strange but I do have an explanation.
- Oh, I can hardly wait.
First of all, I didn't want the feather for myself.
- So far, so good.
- It's for my wife.
You see, I promised her one, and I didn't want to disappoint her.
Secondly, as I pointed out before, I offered to buy the feather.
At no time did I try to take it by force.
Lady, do you wanna prefer any charges?
Well Well, since no actual damage was done to my feather, I guess not.
Okay, you can go.
Oh, may I say something before the lady leaves?
- Go ahead.
- Would you take $30 for it?
You never give up, do you?
You've got the guts of a lion, do you know that?
Do I look like the type of man who would accost ladies in the middle of the night?
- No.
No, I must admit, you don't.
You seem normal enough.
- Well, thank you, sergeant.
- By the way, what's in the bag?
Just some things I bought.
May I go now?
Just as soon as you tell me the contents of the bag.
- Does it matter?
- It matters.
What's in the bag?
Two bat wings, half a pint of porpoise milk, four eye of newt.
You remember what I said about you seeming normal?
Forget it.
Abner, he's back.
Mr. Stephens is back.
Come to bed, Gladys.
I bet she has some strange disease and we could catch it.
Abner, you wanna wake up with something strange?
I've been doing that for 20 years.
Why change now?
Very funny.
So they finally let me go, but the whole experience was rather nerve-racking.
- Oh, you poor thing.
- Never mind about me.
I'm worried about you.
They seem to be getting bigger.
Never mind.
When I get my potion, she'll be as right as rain.
But aren't you still missing one ostrich feather?
Oh, yes, yes.
Well, I'll try and conjure one up.
Now, cross your fingers.
- Is that part of the spell?
- No, but I need all the luck I can get.
One ostrich feather.
I didn't realize they were that big, you know.
There now.
- Is that enough, Aunt Clara?
- I think so.
- Yes.
Yes.
- Well to my health.
How about the?
Let's see, I'd better start with something small.
I'll try and turn out that lamp.
Well, it went out, all right, but not the right way.
Aunt Clara, are you sure you got all the ingredients right?
Oh, yes, yes.
There's the porpoise milk the bat wings, the eye of newt and Of course.
The hair of the dog.
Aunt Clara, will you tell me exactly what you want?
Yes.
Yes.
Now, I want four petals of a black Peruvian rose.
Now, do you know anyone that has a black Peruvian rose?
The police should be arriving in 30 seconds.
I take it you have some explanation for your incomprehensible act?
Yes.
But you'd never believe it.
You know, I had a feeling I'd be seeing you here again but I didn't think it would be so soon.
- Sergeant, I do have an explanation.
- No, let me guess.
You wanted the flower for you wife, right?
- Yes, but - Book him.
Now, we've got to get Darrin out of jail and back here with the flower.
Are you sure you have the right spell, Aunt Clara?
Oh, yes, my spells are getting closer every minute.
Now, this is going to be a bull's-eye.
I certainly hope so.
You've got to deliver this flower.
Otherwise I won't be responsible for the consequences.
- You get one phone call and you've had it.
Go to sleep.
- Come back here.
You don't realize how important this is!
Look, I don't wanna hear another word Sergeant.
Hey, sergeant!
Four.
Let's try it again.
It worked!
Honey, it worked.
Now we'd better get you back to jail before they discover Aunt Clara.
Right.
I'm in enough trouble with a breaking-and-entering charge without adding escaping from jail.
- Don't worry.
We'll work something out.
I'll see you in the morning.
See for yourself, sarge.
I turned my back for a moment, and there was this little old lady I swear, she was there.
What did you do with that old lady?
She just flew out, straight through the wall.
All right, that's enough out of you.
Now, Joe, look, why don't you just take the night off.
Don't be embarrassed.
I mean, the job gets to all of us.
I'm retired, and you drag me out of bed at 7:00 in the morning.
- Some retirement.
- Abner, I told you.
Sure, you told me.
Mrs. Stephens has square green spots all over her.
- Do I have the whole thing correct?
- You'll see.
You'll see.
Oh, hello.
We just They're gone.
They're all gone.
My wife says you weren't feeling well, Mrs. Stephens.
Well, I'm fine now.
It was just one of those 12-hour bugs.
Well, come on, Gladys.
Glad you're feeling better, Mrs. Stephens.
Thank you, Mr. Kravitz.
I wonder if I could have my soup dish back?
Oh, yes, of course.
It's upstairs.
I'll get it.
Oh, no, I'll get it.
You've been sick.
Somebody knocking at the door.
Somebody knocking.
Knock, knock, knock.
Overactive thyroid.
I know how to cure an overactive thyroid.
You take the left ear of a kangaroo and the whiskers of a weasel Thanks, Aunt Clara.
I'll tell him.
Well, I know, just the same.
I don't get it.
First, Norton drops the charges then he agrees to come over here and talk to me.
When you talked to him, did he say why?
Not in so many words.
You haven't been?
Oh, no, of course not, darling.
At least, not yet.
- Sam.
- Oh, that must be Mr. Norton.
Now, why don't you let him in and ask him out here for a cup of coffee.
It's absolutely incredible.
- How did you do it?
- Oh, it was easy.
A little perseverance and suddenly everything was coming up black Peruvian roses.
You're not supposed to be around those.
Now, don't worry, Aunt Clara said I could only get it once.
You won't go back on our bargain?
- Bargain?
- Yes.
As long as we picked one of Mr. Norton's roses I promised him a cutting from one of our black Peruvian rose bushes.
Oh, well, Mr. Norton, I want you to know l'll understand if you request another account executive.
Darrin, all I know is a man whose wife can raise black Peruvian roses can't be all bad.
- She's something pretty special.
- Special?
Mrs. Stephens, you must be the greatest horticulturist in the country or some sort of a magician.
Oh, not at all, Mr. Norton.
- I simply have a green - Nose - Thumb.
- Yes, thumb.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Wake up.
Wake up, Samantha.
This is the day.
Mother, what?
It's 5:00 in the morning.
Well, I wanted to give you time to pack your bags.
What are you talking about?
I've let you have your own way a good deal since you were married but this is the one time you'll do as I say.
- Oh, Mother.
- You owe it to your past.
I'll be back in four hours, and then we'll start on our journey.
Would you mind telling me what this is all about?
This is the black day for us, Samantha.
This is Halloween.
What's the matter, honey?
Did you have a bad dream?
No.
I'm just starting one.
Why aren't you ready to leave?
I am not going to the sacred volcano with you, Mother.
I'm not going to have you stay and be hurt by all those children dressed like old crones.
I'm not going to leave Darrin.
Besides, we're having company.
You're having a party on Halloween?
It isn't a party.
We're having the Tates and a client and his wife for dinner.
You're actually taking part in their barbaric customs.
Mother, when I married Darrin, it was for better or for worse.
Halloween is part of the worse.
I never thought I'd see a daughter of mine condoning bigotry.
I don't condone it.
Anyway, Darrin is not bigoted.
He understands my problem perfectly.
Excuse me.
Parcel for Mrs. Stephens.
Sign here, please.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
You see.
I told you Darrin understood.
He knew I was upset, and he sent me a gift.
Oh, Mother, I wish you'd believe me.
Darrin is really a sweet, sensitive man.
What will we turn him into?
A tadpole or an iguana?
Darrin wouldn't do this.
He just wouldn't.
There must be some explanation.
Maybe we should turn him into a centipede and have him trip and break all his legs.
Wouldn't that be marvellous?
Well, that wouldn't solve anything.
The reason our marriage is a success is because we don't give in to illogical emotion.
We discuss our problems calmly and rationally and solve them like two mature adults who realize Darrin, how could you do this?
Honey, I don't know a thing about witches' hats.
- Darrin?
- Wait a minute, honey.
- What?
- I sent them.
What?
It's a line of party favours that Jack Rogers' company makes.
Since he's coming to your house tonight - Larry, how could you do that?
- What?
What are you trying to do, ruin my marriage, tear down everything?
How can a few little witches' hats do that?
They're obscene.
We wouldn't have them in the house.
- Witches' hats?
- Yes, witches' hats!
Besides, Sam doesn't like them.
They don't go in with her decorating scheme.
Honey?
Try not to be upset.
Well, don't pay any attention to them.
I'll talk to you later, okay?
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Well?
We're going to talk about it later.
Well, the time for talk is over.
Mother.
Good.
I stopped all your calls for a few minutes.
What do you want?
I want Samantha to come with me to the sacred volcano.
Samantha is not going to be taking any trips in her condition, so - The sacred what?
- Volcano.
We go there on Halloween.
Endora, if you think I'm gonna let Sam participate in some weird rites!
We do not have any weird rites.
Well, Sam and I have worked things out for ourselves.
We're doing very nicely.
Thank you.
I'm sure you are.
- You've corrupted my daughter.
- Oh, for Pete's sake.
If you'll excuse me, I have some things to do, Endora.
All right.
That does it.
Get out.
All right.
You may not have anything to do, but I have a meeting.
- You're not going anywhere.
- I'm not going anywhere?
I'm not going anywhere.
Will you stop that?
Look, all I want you to do is to tell Samantha she can go with me.
And I won't play the game according to your rules.
- Now, let me go.
- Let Samantha go.
- Absolutely not.
- All right.
I've tried to be nice to you.
Have a good time tonight, Darwin.
You have a good time too.
I hope the volcano erupts.
I hope they're on time.
If they can get pass those trick-or-treaters they'll be here any minute.
Well, the kids should be going to bed pretty soon.
Sweetheart, I'm a little worried about Mother.
From what you told me, you were pretty firm with her this afternoon.
Relax.
It's the only way to handle her.
You have to stand your ground.
There they Sorry, honey.
Trick or treat.
There you are.
One for you and for you.
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.
Hey, look, I got some pretzels.
- Trick or treat.
- Don't push me, little boy.
Aren't you gonna give us anything?
More than you bargained for if you don't run along, little fellow.
- We're gonna have to trick you.
- I'm ready if you are.
Abracadabra, you're a tree.
Let's get out of here!
That should hold them.
Well, don't we look pretty.
Cut the small talk.
What do you got?
It looks like junk to me, mister.
I'm sorry, but it's the bag or nothing.
No dice.
I'm going to have to trick you.
Go ahead, trick me.
You're tricked.
You'd better watch out.
I'm not worried.
I've been tricked by experts.
Well, honey, that should be the last of them.
- Everything's ready.
- Good.
I think I'll go and check the roast.
By the way, did you chill the?
- Darrin?
- What is it, honey?
Your face.
What about my face?
Well, it's all kind of It's all kind of?
Sam, what's happening?
- Darrin, is this some kind of joke?
- No!
- Well, what did you do?
- What did l?
I didn't do anything.
I went to the door.
There was a little girl there.
L - Well, what did she do?
- She didn't do anything.
She pointed her finger at me, and then she mumbled a few words.
"Picket, ficket" or some What is it?
- What was she wearing?
- She was wearing a gypsy outfit.
What?
Mother.
And then she turned into a tree.
That's the silliest thing I ever heard.
- Mother.
- Oh, hello, Samantha.
You come into the house right away and take that spell off Darrin.
What if I don't want to?
You're coming with me this instant, or I'll You'll what?
- I'll spank you!
- You can't talk to your mother like that.
What costumes they have.
The little one was the mother.
Why did you do this to me?
I think he looks charming with a beard.
Sam.
You Somebody do something.
Take this thing off of me.
If Mother put the curse on, I can't take it off.
Mother, I demand you remove that curse.
Curse?
What curse?
Oh, nothing much.
You're going to be a werewolf.
- Lf this is your idea of a joke - Hardly.
Now, look, Endora, if you My hands.
Oh, good.
Company.
Just a minute.
I can't let anybody see me like this.
I'll go in the den and concentrate.
- Maybe it will come to me.
- It had better.
Good evening.
Samantha, Phyllis and Jack Rogers.
- How do you do?
- It's nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.
- Well, where's Darrin?
Oh, he'll be right down.
He's upstairs changing.
Into what?
Who knows?
How are you feeling, Samantha?
Marvellous, marvellous.
I remember when we had our first child.
Yes.
Jack Jr. The miracle of birth.
That inspired our line of diaper cards.
Jack is so pleased with the way your husband's handled his account.
The Halloween sales were fantastic.
Decorations up 10 percent, party favours up 17 percent and Bag O'Bones costume, up 28 percent.
Hi, everybody.
- Hello.
- Hi, darling.
- You all right?
- Oh, I'm fine, sweetheart.
Don't worry.
They must be very much in love.
He was only upstairs.
Well Louise, Larry and Jack.
- Hi, Darrin.
This is my wife, Phyllis.
How are you, Phyllis?
- What happened to your hand?
- Cut myself shaving.
Larry, will you fix another round of drinks?
I have something to do in the den.
I'll go help.
Excuse me.
Wouldn't leave his side for a minute.
Oh, that's love.
- Did you remember it yet?
- It's not easy.
You know, there are over 7000 combinations of magic words.
Well, try them all.
The hair's growing back.
That might be dangerous.
I did one a minute ago.
A horse, right on the sofa.
If everything else fails, get the horse back.
I may have to leave in a hurry.
- Mother, please concentrate.
- I'll try, dear.
Jack, what was that marvellous costume you had a couple of years ago?
- You must mean the elephant.
- I think she means the family package.
Oh, yes.
The "Togetherness" outfit.
- What was that?
- Well, it was a skyscraper.
Parents on the bottom, the kids on the top.
I just can't understand why it didn't sell.
Brilliant concept.
Excu Excuse me.
Look.
Look what's happening.
I'm still trying to remember.
Well, keep trying!
What happens after the nails?
Let me see your teeth.
My teeth?
- Good.
No fangs yet.
- Fangs?
You're doing fine.
Your ears aren't even pointed yet.
Just your head.
- Lf you think this is funny - Darrin, I feel terrible.
I really do.
Do you think I want my daughter married to a werewolf?
Well, you keep trying.
I gonna go shave again.
No.
I better do it down here.
More coffee anybody?
I'll have some, Samantha.
Where is he?
- Who?
- Darrin.
- Darrin?
- Your husband.
What is it, Sam?
You're acting funny.
Well, I have a lot on my mind.
Rogers is an important account.
This is no time to act funny.
Will you please get Darrin in here?
Tell him to shape up.
Larry, I'm sorry.
Endora?
Endora?
Endora, where are you?
Endora!
Endora, this is no time to play hide-and-seek!
Endora!
Darrin, you can't keep running in and out like this.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Look at this.
And now your mother's gone.
Make some excuse for me.
I've gotta find her before it's too late.
Darrin, wait!
Oh, my stars.
I'll be honest with you, Larry.
I don't understand Darrin tonight.
Yeah.
He does seem a little edgy.
I don't believe he wanted us over here.
Hey, you!
Hi, Larry.
- It sounds like a marvellous recipe.
- It certainly does.
But what do you do with the marshmallows, Samantha?
Bring them to a boil and add the radishes.
What?
Samantha, is anything the matter?
No, no.
Look what we found in the back yard.
Hi, everybody.
Surprise.
- Darrin?
- Sure, it's Darrin.
Phyllis, will you look at that costume?
I wish I could make one like that.
Darrin, why are you wearing that?
You know what this crazy, wonderful guy did?
Well, the kids next door like me to dress up on Halloween.
I can't believe it.
Will you look at that?
That hair almost looks real.
What was that?
Oh, that?
A little noise maker inside my mouth.
It comes with the costume.
That's my favourite part.
Do it again, darling.
Oh, that's ingenious.
I think it's stuck.
That's the best part.
The kids are crazy about it.
Oh, I wish he'd come and show that to Jack Jr. Some time.
Oh, that would be a pleasure.
Darrin, Darrin, I think you'd better change.
Now.
Boy, that's great!
Get away from me, Sam.
I don't know what I'm gonna do next.
- Oh, my stars.
- The closet.
Lock me in the closet.
Lock me in.
Now, you hold on, dear.
I'll go see if I can find Mother.
If I get any worse, call the police.
Oh, I couldn't do that.
Then call the zoo.
Mother, why did you do this?
For a very good reason.
Perhaps, next year Darrin won't treat Halloween so lightly.
You mean, you knew the spell all along?
Take it off this minute.
Give me one good reason why I should.
He's my husband, and I love him.
Well, that's not good enough.
Not this time.
Not until this mortal has really learned his lesson.
His lesson?
You're just as bad as they are.
At least they have an excuse, but I thought you knew better.
- What do you?
- For years you've complained about how they make fun of witches.
"We're not like that," you said.
- "We're nice, civilized people".
- But we are.
But now you're acting just like those ignorant people think a witch acts.
You're behaving exactly like their stereotype witch.
And you're doing it to the one person willing to believe we were different.
Well I'll say it once and only once.
I was wrong, Samantha.
I'm sorry.
What's going on out there?
Oh, Darrin.
Sweetheart.
Endora, you remembered the words.
I never forgot them.
She never for You never forgot them?
You mean, this whole thing was a joke?
The hair, the fangs, the claws?
How could you do that?
Simple.
Well, I'm sorry you couldn't come earlier, Endora.
- It's certainly been nice meeting you.
- Well, thank you very much.
- Yeah, she's loads of fun.
- Oh, yeah.
Darrin, next Halloween I want you to wear that costume to our house.
Well, we'll have to see about that.
Now don't worry, Larry.
He'll probably be there.
That was a marvellous costume.
Yours too, Endora.
- I beg your pardon?
- That bizarre outfit you're wearing.
And that hairdo.
Jack, your car's waiting.
You were saying, Mr. Rogers?
That's a great outfit you're wearing.
You must have won first prize.
Mother, why don't you help me with the dishes.
Costume, eh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
- Mother.
- Good night, Jack.
- Good night, Darrin.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Happy Halloween.
Oh, yes.
Ta-ta, darlings.
See you both soon.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Honey, I'm home.
- Oh, Darrin.
- Aunt Clara.
- So nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
What you got there?
Twenty-four jars of concentrated health compliments of Mother Jenny.
What's she doing here?
Aunt Clara, would you excuse us for a minute?
Why, of course.
Of course.
- Sam, may I speak to you?
- When?
Now.
Be back in a minute.
I'll be glad to get rid of these heavy boxes.
I wish I never heard of Mother Jenny's Jam.
- Who's Mother Jenny?
- His name is Charles Barlow and these are samples of the jam he makes.
Very healthy.
I can see how carrying all this weight around could make you healthy.
What do we have to do for all this goodness?
I'm glad you asked.
Mr. Barlow has to leave early tomorrow morning so Larry's having a cocktail party for him at the office today.
Oh, no.
If you'd only told me earlier.
I haven't a thing to wear.
How about that dress you wore at the last office affair?
I wore that to the last office affair.
How about the green one?
I wore that at the other office party before that.
Oh, dear.
Darrin, it's just that you've given me so little warning.
I don't know what the other women are wearing.
How dressy is it?
What do you usually wear to a jam session?
Okay.
I'll wear my blue jeans and my Beethoven sweatshirt.
Ring a-ding a-do Well!
Oh, Clara, you're out of your slump.
Well, I mean May I make a suggestion?
Aunt Clara!
Did you make that?
Oh, not really.
This is just a little something I whipped up.
Well, it's lovely.
Isn't it, Darrin?
Sam, I'm not sure that you should wear - It's a gift.
- Did I do something wrong?
Oh, no, no.
Not at all.
Well, you have a very funny look on your face.
Well, it's just that with Sam wearing such a beautiful dress l'm afraid that I'll look a little seedy.
Well, while I'm in the groove, let me whip up something for you.
Skat, skin a cat Well, do you like it?
It's very nice, Aunt Clara.
Thank you very much.
Does it fit?
Alterations included, you know.
Oh, it fits like a suit.
I'm sure Mr. Barlow will be very impressed.
As long as it's a family affair, do you suppose Aunt Clara could come too?
Oh, no, dear.
- Oh, no.
Now, I couldn't intrude.
- As a matter of fact this is just the chance we've been looking for to show you off.
Oh, how nice.
The only empty space in two blocks, and there's a fire hydrant.
Oh, is that bad?
It would be a lot easier to park if it weren't there.
Well, then, why not?
Honey, you better tell Aunt Clara the law doesn't like you to move Oh, it worked the very first time.
Oh, Clara, you're on a winning streak.
Don't tell me, mister.
Let me guess your hobby.
- You collect parking tickets, right?
- I beg your pardon?
Maybe you need glasses.
You're parked in front of a hydrant.
- What hydrant?
- Okay.
What do you call that thing over there on the sidewalk?
"That thing" happens to be my wife.
No, no.
The other thing.
That happens to be my aunt.
Her favourite aunt.
Look, I've been on this beat for three years and I know the position of every hydrant in this area, so It's over there.
I'm sorry, folks.
I've had a rough day.
Well, we all have our problems.
Ladies.
I just thought of something.
That car parked in front of the hydrant will get the ticket intended for us.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that too much if I were you.
Why not?
It belongs to the police commissioner.
Very smart move, bringing your aunt.
Barlow seems to like family.
Good thinking.
Yes, Aunt Clara does have a certain Victorian charm.
Judging from the jam, Barlow dates back to the Inquisition.
Sorry.
Afterwards, why don't you two and Clara have dinner with Louise and me?
- Fine.
- Well, that's lovely, Larry.
Well, here's to the Mother Jenny.
What was that?
"Guess who's" vegetable punch.
Barlow refers to it as "liquid health".
Larry, Darrin you're not going to help him sell this stuff to an unsuspecting public, are you?
- We're considering it.
- We're considering it.
Let me know when you've come to a decision so I can decide whether I want to associate with either of you.
I'll go check on Aunt Clara.
Well, the charming Mrs. Stephens again.
That is a lovely dress you're wearing.
Thank you, Mr. Barlow.
It's an original.
Yes.
Aunt Clara dreamed it up for me.
Your aunt and I have been having quite an interesting talk.
It seems she doesn't like my jam.
Oh, I'm sure she does.
Well, I like the jar.
And I think the label is very attractive.
But when you open it, it's a matter of taste, isn't it?
And it doesn't have any.
She's such a kidder.
Aunt Clara, you haven't tasted Mr. Barlow's punch yet.
- It's quite an experience.
- Oh, I should like that.
I hate to put a damper on the party, but I'll have to leave pretty soon.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Barlow.
We hate to lose the life of the party.
Well, that's the way it is.
Perhaps someone could drop me off at the hotel.
Oh, I'm sure the Stephens would be glad to.
- Certainly.
- Thank you.
Oh, there's Louise.
Excuse me a moment.
You catching an early plane, Mr. Barlow?
No.
It's not that.
You see, Mrs. Stephens, I've been a student of health in all its aspects.
Yes, I know.
And I've come to some important conclusions.
One, pure nutritious foods.
Two, early sleep is the best sleep.
Three, naturally, the earlier you get to sleep, the better it is.
Aunt Clara.
Four, pure nutritious foods.
She is a dear.
She wants us to have a good time, you know.
You know, some people have been flattering enough to compare me with Louis Pasteur and Bernarr Macfadden.
But of course, that's for history to decide.
I consider myself just a humble worker in the vineyard of health.
As is see it How do you see it, Mr. Barlow?
Well, weren't you wearing another kind of dress?
- Pardon?
- Well, I could have sworn But of course I never swear.
I thought it was green, not red.
Well, it's reddish green.
You know how these synthetics are.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Would you excuse me, please?
I think I'm much tireder than I thought.
Aunt Clara!
- A red dress?
- Oh, well, why not?
You could have come closer to the original.
You'll be conspicuous.
I could have been a lot more conspicuous.
Oh, my dress didn't hold up.
It started doing a striptease.
That fire hydrant's liable to get homesick any minute.
- You better go and move the car.
- Right.
Darrin, Mr. Barlow is tired and ready to leave.
- Can you drop him off at his hotel?
- Fine, fine.
Let's go, Mr. Barlow.
And I'll take Samantha and Aunt Clara and you join us at the house.
No, I think I better let Darrin drop me off.
I've had a little too much of that punch.
And I'm feeling I'm feeling rather healthy.
Come along.
I'll take you home as soon as we drop Mr. Barlow at his hotel.
Here you are, Mr. Barlow.
Stephens, do you usually park by a fire hydrant?
It really is my fault the car being parked by the hydrant.
Come along, Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara.
- Stephens?
- Yes.
Do you feel a draft?
Oh, Clara, what hast thou wrought?
Aunt Clara.
I'm working on it.
I'm I'm working on it.
Hey, you!
That's the blue gentleman again.
You do collect tickets, don't you, sir?
Hey, buddy.
Come out here where I can see you.
Don't play hide-and-seek with me.
Why don't you put the ticket on the windshield?
I have to check the tires.
What's going on here?
Aunt Clara, do something!
Aunt Clara, do something, please!
That was a neat trick, Mac, but you had the wrong audience.
Oh, I've got a long list for you.
Resisting arrest impersonating an officer.
Me?
What is this craziness?
I suppose you know there's a law against this.
I'm gonna throw the book at you.
I don't know these people.
I never saw them before in my life.
I had nothing to do with this.
Oh, yeah?
Why were you running?
I was trying to help you catch him.
He's right, officer.
Mr. Barlow didn't have anything to do with this.
Stephens, you and your aunt just aren't Mother Jenny's Jam people.
Good work, officer.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Aunt Clara, you better tell Sam what happened.
Yes.
All right, officer, I'll go quietly.
Well, it's the last time I'll be a back-seat driver, I'll tell you now.
Hey, Montague.
I got company for you.
Tell him to leave his card.
I'll call him later.
You both have an appointment with Judge Crosetti in the morning.
Kind of informal, aren't you?
Well, the way it happened was Oh, forget it.
One thing I can't stand is a sneaky drunk.
Now just a minute.
All I had to drink was some vegetable punch.
Yeah, sure.
Vegetable punch, fruit juice, cough medicine.
That's the trouble with you boozers, you can't face up to reality.
You live in a dream world.
You see everything through an alcoholic haze.
You can't face up to things the way they really are: Miserable.
Could you save all the philosophical advice until the morning?
Sam, will you stop worrying?
He probably got caught in cross-town traffic, that's all.
I don't know.
I have a strange feeling something's happened.
Intuition?
You could call it that.
I've never put much stock in women's intuition.
Well, that depends on the woman.
Larry, would you mind making my excuses to Louise?
- Well, Sam, at least let me drive you.
- No, thanks, Larry, but I've gotta fly.
Oh, Clara, you did it.
Oh, my poor Darrin.
I wonder who that charming gentleman is with him.
What you lushes need is to develop a sense of social responsibility.
Yeah.
Then, and only then will you be able to face life directly in the eye and march bravely forward.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Take your hands off me or put some clothes on, one or the other.
Darrin will freeze to death if I don't get some clothes on him.
Help!
Help!
Bartender!
I mean, jailer!
Aunt Clara, you blew it again.
Oh, it's a shame men don't dress like that nowadays.
Turnkey!
Warden!
All right, Montague, knock it off.
Help.
Get me out of here!
Could you arrange for me to have a single room?
He had on tights and a plume in his hat and a big sword.
One's not enough.
Now I got two of them.
My advice to you both is to get some sleep.
Help!
Look at him now.
He's got a tin suit on.
Okay, I'll be right back with a can opener.
Angels and ministers of grace, protect me.
And everything went all flooey.
People running around without their clothes.
Oh, terrible, dear.
Well, I'm so glad you've come, dear.
Look.
Oh, poor Darrin.
Well, at least he's all right.
Hey, nutsy.
Do it again.
You know something, that's a pretty good bar trick.
I could get a lot of free drinks with that.
- How do you do it?
- All you have to do is snap your fingers.
Just snap your fingers.
Yeah?
Yes, I tried, dear.
I tried.
But I don't seem to be able to have the same old zing as usual.
Well, I'll tell you what you do.
Now, you go upstairs and take a hot bath and get a good night's sleep.
Oh, yes.
No, no.
I think I'll polish my doorknob collection.
So consoling, dear.
- Yes.
Yes, of course.
- So consoling.
I think maybe I'll take some clothes to Darrin.
I did it.
I did it!
And I did it a lot better than you did, buddy.
Now Honey.
Darrin, I'm so terribly sorry about all this.
- You want me to spring you?
- No.
I'm in enough trouble with the law already.
What's gonna happen when you have to face the judge?
Somehow I have a feeling things are going to be all right.
- So don't worry, honey.
- Hey, just a minute, buddy.
I dreamed her up.
I'll thank you to stop kissing her.
Good night, sweetheart.
See you in court.
So before I could write out a ticket for parking in front of a hydrant somehow he shucked off his clothes which is another violation.
Then he ducked behind the car.
So in pursuant to my duty I pursued him around the car and apprehended him on the third time around.
Then I locked him up, Your Honour.
All right, Mr. Stephens, what do you have to say?
Your Honour, I don't like to contradict an officer who was pursuing his duty but how could I have been taken from my cell fully clothed this morning if I was in my shorts when I was locked up?
Was he locked up all night?
Well, yes, sir.
But he had his clothes on this morning when he was taken out.
Doesn't that seem a little strange to you?
Well, now that you mention it, yeah, Your Honour.
But he was in his underwear when he was locked up.
- I've got a witness.
- Who's your witness?
Montague, come on up here.
Morning, Judge Crosetti.
How's the wife and kids?
Montague was in the cell with him all night, Your Honour.
- Is that true, Mr. Stephens?
- Yes, Your Honour.
It's all right.
Go ahead, tell the judge everything.
Don't hold anything back.
All right.
How was the defendant clothed?
Judge, you should have been in that cell.
Never mind the wishful thinking.
How was the defendant clothed?
Well, first he had on these fancy tights and a big sword like Richard Burton.
He can cut quite a figure.
And then Then he had on a suit of armour like a knight.
Only he didn't bring his horse.
You forgot his horse.
And he clanked around for a while.
All right, Montague, I think I've got the picture.
Just tell me one thing more.
Where did he get the clothes that he's got on now?
A beautiful girl appeared in the cell with some clothes on a hanger.
And she just gave them to him.
This is your only witness?
- Yes, Your Honour.
- I see.
You're dismissed, Mr. Stephens.
- Thank you, Your Honour.
- And you too, Montague.
Thank you, judge.
Be seeing you.
Officer, I'd like to speak to you a minute.
Judge!
That's her!
That's the girl!
- Out!
- Judge Out!
Out!
Aunt Clara won't be here when you come home so she wanted to say goodbye.
- Well, goodbye, Aunt Clara.
- Oh, not goodbye, dear, no.
Ta-ta.
Oh, I hope my little visit hasn't caused any trouble.
No.
No, not at all.
Oh, good.
Well, it's time for takeoff.
And everything is A-okay.
A-okay?
Yes, I like to keep up with the times.
Well, countdown.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Blastoff.
Oh, nuts.
Will you give me a little boost, dear?
Yes, certainly.
Take a deep breath.
Three, two, one.
Thank you, dear.
Ta-ta.
Oh, anytime.
Sam, you can't go on like this.
Well - That'll be Larry.
- What are you gonna tell him?
I'll simply tell him if he's decided to fire me l've decided to quit.
Hello, Samantha.
- Hi, Larry.
- Let's go, Darrin.
I have something important to talk over with you.
Why don't you say it here and get it over with?
Say what?
Well, the Barlow affair, what else?
Oh, yes.
He told me some weird story about you being in your underwear and being chased by a policeman.
And then there was something about fire hydrants and traffic tickets It was wild.
You know what I think?
- What?
- I think he's a king-size bore.
And I've decided that our office isn't interested in handling his account.
- Good.
- Who needs a nut like that?
Give me nice, ordinary human beings like you two.
The Barlows of this world can get you into trouble.
You could even wind up in jail.
Let's go, Darrin.
I'll see you tonight, honey.
Ta-ta.
So long.
Good.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
- Good afternoon.
Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes?
I'm Dr. Passmore.
Is Mr. Stephens in?
No, I'm sorry, he isn't, but I expect him soon.
- Won't you come in, doctor?
- Oh, thank you.
Oh, just by way of introduction I am chief psychiatrist at Meadowbrook Rest Home.
Our guests are aware that this is the centennial of the year which marked the end of the War Between the States and they'd like to do something about it.
Aren't they a bit late?
Mrs. Stephens, they would like to commemorate the event.
Yes, of course.
Well, what's this got to do with Darrin?
Well, it's necessary for us to inform the public of our undertaking.
That means advertising and I understand your husband excels in that field.
Oh, he does.
And it sounds like a wonderful idea.
I can vouch for Darrin.
I'm certain he'll be happy to do your publicity.
Oh, really?
Then I may depend upon it?
For such a worthy cause?
I give you my word.
You gave him your word?
Honey, I'm right in the middle of planning the Jarvis account l'm drawing the Slater TV commercials and I'm racing the clock planning that Murphy's Supermarket opening and you gave him your word.
- Darrin, please.
Well, then I'll give you my word.
In a word, "no".
I thought you wanted me to be interested in civic things.
I do.
So, what are you doing for this noble project?
Sam, I couldn't do it even if I wanted to.
My knowledge of the Civil War is slightly less than limited.
I could help.
Mine's perfect.
Hello?
Hello, Dr. Passmore.
Well, I'm happy to do it.
Oh, well, could I make a suggestion?
I think my wife would be perfect for it.
Oh, yes, an expert.
She'll do it.
I give you my word.
Bye.
- Do what?
- Write the pageant.
Write the?
Me?
Hello, Mother.
It's a wise child who knows her own mother.
Darling, I thought we could spend some time with each other.
Nope.
Can't.
I'm writing a play.
Just started four hours ago.
Oh, really?
What's it about?
The American Civil War.
Well, the simple stories are always the best.
Oh, I wish Darrin hadn't given my word I'd do this.
- Well, maybe I could be of some help.
- How?
Well, I could be your secretary.
I can type faster than anybody.
Watch this.
"The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy 'merplederk"'?
Well, I said I was fast, not accurate.
Thank you, but I'm afraid this is one thing I'll have to do for myself.
All right.
All right, darling.
Be independent.
Just do it the hard way.
Hope you like my script for the pageant.
Well l'll go change and then I'll fix dinner.
It's still very rough.
- Don't expect too much.
- What?
Oh, okay, honey.
A sandwich will be fine.
Well?
Whatever it is you've been cooking certainly smells good, sweetheart.
We're having cold cuts.
That bad, huh?
Oh, it's not bad for a first try.
Worth a second?
Go on, Darrin.
You can be honest.
Well, darling, to tell the truth, it's the characters.
They're kind of stereotyped, one-dimensional.
You gotta flesh them out.
Think of them as real people.
Well, I've learned something very important tonight.
- What's that?
- Never let your husband criticize on an empty stomach.
Oh, my stars.
Now, don't tell me you haven't finished, Samantha.
I had the wrong slant, Mother.
I'm starting again.
Do you realize the war might take longer to write than it did to fight?
My problem, according to Darrin, the critic, is my characters.
He thinks I should flesh them out more.
Well, I think that's an excellent idea.
Place them in front of you so you can see them better and then you'll be able to write them better.
- You might have a point.
- Well, I'll leave you with it.
Just bear in mind, darling: Write mortal, think witch.
Let's see.
Captain Corcoran.
My hero.
My hero.
If you're so great, how come you're so one-dimensional?
It would help to see you better.
Captain Corcoran.
Tall.
Handsome.
Courageous.
Intelligent.
My!
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
Oh, yes, Captain Corcoran, I think you'll do very nicely.
My, what a beautiful horse.
But that beard will have to go.
Never.
I beg your pardon?
A Confederate officer without his beard?
Why, I'd die of shame, ma'am.
I would.
I'd just die of shame.
Now, listen here.
If it weren't for my vivid imagination you wouldn't be here in the first place, beard or no beard.
So, what I say goes.
But I tell you, ma'am, if I have to face the enemy clean-shaven why, I'd rather lose the war.
You're Southern.
You did lose.
Don't dampen my spirits, ma'am.
I don't know that yet.
I'll show you.
Now this is the way it should go.
Charge!
No.
I think you were better off in my mind.
Well, all right.
Now, let's see how you turned out.
Hey, not bad, you know.
Nice headband.
Hey, you've got pretty good taste.
I think you've done a first-rate job.
- There's only one small comment.
- Well, what's that?
Well, what's an Indian doing in the American Civil War?
Well, I wanted somebody without any political allegiance to either side.
Sort of a chorus.
Now, may I ask you a question?
- Why don't you talk like an Indian?
- Well, why don't you think like one?
- Because I don't have a cliché mind.
- Well, that's fine with me.
I mean, I hate to say lines like: "White man speak with forked tongue".
- Let me worry about that.
- Well, no, I mean I was just mentioning it, you know.
"Ugh" is out too.
I'd like to see how my two characters measure up to each other.
Miss Samantha, ma'am would it be impertinent of me to suggest a bit of love interest?
- Good man.
- I meant for me.
You're absolutely right.
What you need is a lovely young girl from Pennsylvania.
- A Northern girl?
!
- Yes, that's right.
But you love each other, even though her sympathies are with the North.
- Hey, that's a pretty good conflict.
- Oh, thank you.
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny.
- Don't leave me, Johnny.
- Oh, no, sugar.
- Don't leave me.
- All right, all right.
Let's not overdo it.
- You'd better go.
- We're just getting started, ma'am.
Well, I can't let people see you here.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
I don't wanna bother you if you have company.
- No, no, I'm alone.
- You're alone?
Oh, you are?
Well, I see you are.
Well, I won't keep you.
I just came to borrow a cup of horse Sugar.
- I'd be happy to get it for you.
- Thank you.
- Won't you come in?
- No, I'll stay right here.
Thank you.
- Mrs. Stephens said she was alone.
- She is.
- Well, what about the two of you?
- Oh, we're not real.
We're just something she dreamed up.
- That's crazy!
- Isn't it though?
We're right out of her mind.
Come on.
Abner!
Abner!
Help!
Help!
Abner!
Abner!
Help!
- What are you doing here?
- Well, how should I know?
You thought about us, and here we are.
You mean, all I had to do was think about you?
Samantha?
- There's Darrin.
You better leave.
- Can't we meet him?
No.
He isn't used to this sort of thing.
At least give me a chance to explain.
Okay.
- How do I get rid of you?
- Try making your mind a blank.
Good.
What's Mrs. Kravitz so hysterical about?
- Well, you know Mrs. Kravitz.
- Yeah.
Who are they?
Who are who?
I see an Indian, a girl in a long dress and a Confederate officer with his horse.
You see an Indian, a girl in a long dress and a Confederate officer with his horse?
Sam!
Now, Darrin, please try not to be angry.
I know it's gonna be difficult for you to understand at first.
You see, they're They're figments of my imagination.
- Imagination?
- Characters in my play.
That's ridiculous.
Look, you people would you mind just going back into her mind or wherever you came from.
- Now, Darrin, please don't be upset.
Well, l - What happened?
- I kissed you, I guess.
I know you kissed me, but what has that got to do with anything?
Well, when I kiss you, I can't think about anything else.
And when I stop thinking, they disappear.
- Now you kiss me.
- Why, are they back?
No, just for the heck of it.
And don't worry, darling, I can control them.
- Hey, author.
Sam.
- Yeah?
Hey, we got a great idea for the second act.
Now, I'm guiding Violet through the battlefield to see her lover.
- You listening?
- Yeah.
There's a blinding rainstorm.
Sam!
Now look, all you characters are gonna have to - Where's your horse?
- Sam.
Okay.
We're forced to take cover.
Now, when Violet doesn't show up, I think that she All right!
Cut, cut.
I've had it with you characters.
- That Violet has been killed.
- Sam, will you stop thinking?
Well, I'm trying to, but they seem to have taken on lives of their own.
Corcoran now decides that life isn't worth living.
Look, would you?
Hey, that's not bad.
Now, get this.
This could be the big scene in the play.
The captain gets on his horse and rides into the blazing battlefield unaware that a band of desperadoes Sam, I can't understand why you don't do something.
You're a witch.
With a perfectly normal subconscious and nobody can control their subconscious.
Besides, since I started writing, I have an over-stimulated imagination.
Well, then forget the whole project.
Tell Passmore to get somebody else.
Well, I can't go back on my promise.
Honey, he'll understand.
He's a psychiatrist.
His life is filled with broken promises.
- Darrin.
- Besides, I see them everywhere.
They're in the bathroom.
They're in the closet.
I even saw them in the Excuse me.
I even Why am I even being polite to him?
What's the matter, you don't like minority groups?
Out of her mind.
You've talked half the night about that.
Now, if I hear it one more time The Indian came right out of her mind and vanished into thin air.
Okay, Gladys, I've had enough.
You're gonna see a psychiatrist.
Hello?
- Oh, hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
I finished the last poster.
I'll drop them off at Dr. Passmore's office.
Why don't you meet me there.
We'll have lunch afterwards give your mind a rest.
- Okay?
- I think it's very okay.
I'll meet you there.
Bye-bye.
The mind is a very puzzling thing.
You see, these characters just appear very real to you.
It's because you haven't seen them.
Now, the Indian is dressed in doeskin and is wearing a feather.
And the soldier has on a grey uniform like they used to wear during the Civil War.
And the girl has on a long gown.
Mrs. Kravitz, I assure you, they're all in your mind.
No.
I told you.
They're all in her mind and then they vanish into thin air.
Now then, I want you to repeat after me: "It's all in my mind".
It's all in my mind.
"It's all in my mind".
It's all in my mind.
"It's all in my mind".
It's all in my mind.
That's better.
Now, I want you to believe that.
- Do you?
- No.
Yes.
Splendid.
Very well.
I want you to take three of these every day for the next week.
And, Mrs. Kravitz, get out more.
Get a hobby.
Join things.
Darrin Stephens to see Dr. Passmore.
It's all in the mind.
Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
- You too?
- What?
Save your money.
It's all hallucinations.
Get yourself a hobby.
Join things.
It's all in the mind.
I'm gonna be all right.
Good to see you, Mr. Stephens.
And Mrs. Stephens.
- Doctor.
- Come right in, please.
- Thank you.
- Come right in.
You're ready to show me the posters, I see.
Yes, right here.
Here's the first one.
I used this one to point up the importance of commemorating the event.
- Very good.
Very good indeed.
Beautiful, Mr. Stephens.
Perfectly, perfectly beautiful.
You are an artist indeed.
You know, I must say, you've captured the Mr. Stephens?
Do you do that often?
He's crazy about me.
Yes.
I read somewhere when your wife is expecting you should show her lots of love and affection.
Well, there's a time and a place for everything, Mr. Stephens.
- Could I see the next poster, please?
- Oh, certainly.
I used very striking colours in this one.
Now, I wanted to illustrate here the importance of being involved Sam.
- Who are they?
- Who are who?
Well, I see an Indian a girl in a long dress and a Confederate officer with his horse.
You see an Indian, a girl in a long dress and a Confederate officer with his horse?
How about that?
Well, thank you, Mr. Stephens.
Good to see you.
Thanks for stopping by.
Well, it's good to see you, doctor.
Sam.
Sam.
It's all in my mind.
It's all in my mind.
It's all in my mind.
I don't know how I ever managed to live through that.
I'm only human.
Well, you know what I mean.
Well, I hope you're all satisfied.
If you had one shred of decency, you'd go back where you came from and never darken my mind again.
Leave?
Well, what do you think we've been trying to do?
I'd love to go, ma'am.
You're not a bad writer, but you're no Lillian Hellman.
The trouble is, we've no place to go.
We don't have a home.
- Home?
- A plot.
Now, how can we settle down in a play unless we have a plot?
We've been trying to tell you how to finish this thing but you haven't been paying attention.
Now, sit down.
Now that we're solid, three-dimensional characters we'll help you finish the play.
Now, take this down.
This is what happens.
I say to the captain: "Captain, the war is over.
The South has capitulated".
Then it's the end of everything.
Bang.
I rush in.
I see him.
You killed the captain.
- You killed him.
- No, l Bang.
He was my friend.
He did it himself.
It was the only way that he could die with honour.
I hereby swear that I will dedicate my entire life to seeing that these fine men did not die in vain.
Out of this black day, a mighty nation will grow.
Something good will come of this.
The orchestra hits "glory, glory, hallelujah" and as the music swells to a crescendo, the curtain slowly falls.
The end.
It worked!
Oh, Darrin, it worked.
They found a home.
My heartfelt congratulations.
Don't I deserve a kiss for that?
Well, I don't know.
What do you mean?
Well, there doesn't seem to be much point in kissing now.
Darrin.
That was quite an experience.
Yes, the sets and costumes were lovely but, oh, those actors.
Well, the actors never quite live up to the conception of the characters.
By the way, I saw you talking to a lady after the show.
It seemed like quite a big conference.
What was it about?
- Would you like some coffee?
- What was it about, honey?
Milk, tea, hot cocoa?
I'm not thirsty, and you didn't answer the question.
Who was the lady?
Oh, just a lady from the Ladies' League.
I'm listening.
Well, they wanna put on sort of a vaudeville show.
You know, song-and-dance acts, and Sam, you didn't.
Hello.
I hope I'm not disturbing anything.
- Oh, no.
We're all alone.
- Oh, good.
I just wanted to tell Mrs. Stephens how much I enjoyed the - Sam!
- Yes, dear?
Now, how will I ever be sure that that will never happen again?
Well, I guess you'll just have to give me lots of love and affection.
Then I can promise they won't be back.
That's blackmail.
Yes, I know.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Darrin.
It's 7:30.
Is he always so bright and cheerful in the morning?
Mother, will you please get out of here?
The poor dear's been up all night trying to think up a campaign to sell that boat.
- You think that's amusing?
- No.
I was just thinking how sweet he looks.
Like a little boy.
- Bet he was cute.
- What makes you think that?
Well, look at what he grew up to look like.
Oh, that's the argument I was going to use.
I've never seen any photos of Darrin when he was a little boy.
- Wonder what he was really like.
- Well, that's easy to find out.
Don't you dare.
Darrin wouldn't like that.
Oh, don't be silly.
He needn't ever know.
Mother.
Oh, Samantha, you better start praying for a girl.
I think he's adorable.
I'll consider myself very lucky if our child looks like him.
Now, I think you'd better change him back.
No.
No, I'd like a better look at him.
Hi, Sam.
What time is it?
Why don't you look at your Mickey Mouse watch.
- It's 7:30.
- That late?
Funny.
My voice sounds strange.
Must have slept on my ear.
Well, I've gotta get moving.
Have a lot of work to do before I meet with the client this afternoon.
Darrin.
Darrin, I have something to tell you.
Tell me at breakfast.
I have to change.
- Darrin - Ambitious little rascal, isn't he?
I'd say he'd grow up to be president if I didn't know better.
Take that spell off.
Well it'll take me a moment to think of it.
Samantha!
Sam, it has got to stop.
I'm a human being, not a plaything to be whapped up and down at will.
Oh, darling, I agree.
It was a terrible thing for Mother to do but would you please eat?
- Terrible?
She could have stunted me out of 10 years' growth.
As a matter of fact, she did.
Twenty, actually.
But who's counting?
- At least have some coffee.
- Where's your mother now?
I don't know.
When you yelled, she took the spell off and disappeared.
You coward!
Darrin, I know you have every right in the world to be angry at Mother.
I tried to stop her, but you know how she is.
You know how hard to control she is.
But I tried.
Believe me, I tried.
You know, I've been yelling at the wrong person.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Wasn't your fault.
Yeah.
Well, if it's any consolation to you, you were a very cute little boy.
Thanks.
I'll make Mother promise it won't happen again.
And especially not when I'm shaving.
Although after I have that meeting this afternoon I may want to cut my throat.
But I'd like it to be my decision.
Still no ideas?
Oh, plenty of ideas, but they've all been used before.
Sam, we've used five campaigns to try to sell this series of models.
Nothing works.
I don't get it.
They're great fun to build.
Well, you'll think of something.
You always do.
I'd better.
I'm the agency's last chance.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Darrin?
I hope our baby looks just like you.
Well, I'll go along with that.
As long as it's a boy.
I wonder what you looked like when you were a baby.
Sweetheart the very minute I feel a bearskin rug on my stomach, so help me - Bye.
- Bye.
Harding's on his way up.
Now remember, Darrin, you're our last chance.
If you don't come through, the agency will lose thousands of dollars.
- Thanks for the pep talk, Larry.
- What?
When you came in here, I was feeling rather insecure.
Now I just feel rotten.
You son of a gun.
I always said that Donald had no sense of humour.
Mother, it isn't funny.
How would you feel if you woke up one morning and found yourself No comment.
So Dennis got quite ugly about the whole affair, did he?
Now, what exactly did he say?
Before or after he called you an old witch with a warped sense of humour?
An old witch?
How dare he?
No.
How dare you?
Tell - Tell Darrin I'm sorry.
- You got his name right.
What's in a name?
By the way, where is he?
- He's at the office.
Why?
- No reason.
Mr. Harding, you're about to meet one of our brightest young men.
And if he can't create a successful campaign for you, nobody can.
Mr. Harding, meet your new account executive.
Well, glad to meet you, Mr. Harding.
I've been studying your marketing procedures and have devised a saturation campaign using all media.
I believe you'll find it extremely effective.
Now, if you'll look at this breakdown in figures compiled by our One of these days my mother-in-law is gonna go too far.
- Get my wife on the phone.
- Yes, sir.
- What?
- Never mind.
Can I help you, little boy?
I'd appreciate it if you'd loan me a dime.
What seems to be the trouble, sonny, did you lose your mommy?
No.
Look, if you'll loan me the dime, I'll write you a check.
Sorry, I seem to have misplaced my check book.
But believe me, I'm good for the dime.
Thank you.
- Samantha.
- Who is this?
- This is Darrin.
- Darrin?
- Gee, your voice sounds funny.
- That's because it hasn't changed yet.
- Sam, how could you do this to me?
- Do what?
Darrin, are you in some kind of trouble?
Yes, I'm in trouble.
- Has Mother been at it again?
- Yes, she's been at it again.
Look, Sam, you're my wife, and I love you and when I married you, I expected a mother-in-law problem, but this is I'll be through in a minute.
Look, Sam, you can explain later.
Just make me grow up.
All right, Darrin.
I'll try.
Now, just stay calm.
I'll try and remember how Mother did it.
- Has your appearance changed?
- Now I know how Superman feels.
When you come home, I'll explain how it all happened.
I can hardly wait.
I guess that's how it happened.
Well, sweetheart, you know Mother.
Her sense of humour's a bit offbeat.
- Offbeat?
"Juvenile" is a better word.
She's the one who needs to grow up.
- What did you tell Larry?
- I didn't tell him anything.
When I got back to the office, he and Harding were gone.
Larry's probably out trying to get the account back.
- Hi, Larry.
- Hi, Sam.
We were just talking about you.
I hate to barge in like this, but I had to see Darrin.
- Where's that kid?
- Kid?
The one in your office.
Is he a relative of yours?
- You might say that.
- A close relative?
Fairly close.
I thought so.
You know, he looked a bit like you.
Anyway, I wanna congratulate you, Darrin.
Mr. Harding thinks it was a masterstroke.
What was?
Getting the kid.
Getting the kid?
When you wanna know what's wrong with a dish mop you ask a housewife.
Right, Samantha?
I guess so.
So when you wanna find out why a toy isn't selling what's more natural than to ask a kid, huh?
- Sounds logical, Larry.
- Oh, come on, Darrin.
Anyway, the important thing is that Harding thinks so.
Oh, thanks, Sam.
I've set up another meeting for tomorrow morning.
Harding, you, me and the kid.
The kid?
Larry, that's not possible.
- Why not?
- Larry wouldn't another little boy do just as well?
No.
He wants that kid.
You know how unreasonable he can be.
He thinks there's something special about the boy.
He's right about that.
Larry, believe me, the kid is not what he seems.
And I'm sure he won't wanna go.
Well, then use your influence.
You said he was a relative of yours, didn't you?
- Well - So give him a couple of bucks.
Increase his allowance.
Anything.
He's the only one who can save that account for us.
- Yes.
But, Larry - Darrin.
I don't wanna lose this account.
I'd also like to point out that this whole idea was yours in the first place.
- Larry, in that case, the boy - Will be there.
Thank you, Sam.
Have him at the office at 9 in the morning.
Okay?
And, Darrin, incidentally would you tell him to knock off the mother-in-law jokes?
Aren't you gonna put it in the parking lot?
Well, it's late, honey.
You'd better make the transformation and drop me off and park the car around the corner.
Well, all right.
- You ready?
- No.
Sam, I don't know about this.
Well, it'll only be for about an hour.
And we can't disappoint Larry now.
I guess not.
Okay, hit me.
I still don't know what campaign's gonna sell this toy.
Well, I think it's silly for them to put so much faith in you.
After all, what do they expect from a 10-year-old kid?
Sorry, I was only trying to make you feel better.
Sam, nobody likes a smart-aleck witch.
I'll see you in my office after the meeting.
Darrin.
Excuse me, kids.
Kids?
Get him.
Hey, where'd you get the funny clothes?
Pretty fancy, eh, Stu?
Look, boys, I haven't got time to fool around.
- I'm late for a meeting.
- So who's stopping you?
- I don't find that at all amusing.
- Hey, you talk funny.
- Yeah, you sound just like my dad.
- All right, give me the toy back.
- You want it?
Stu, catch.
- Hey, give it to me.
Give it to me.
You'll break it.
Oh, don't Give it to me.
Come on.
Give it to me.
- You'll break it.
Please, give it to me.
- Stu, let him have it.
Yeah, who needs it.
It's a crummy toy anyway.
- How do you know?
- I got one at home.
My dad wanted to buy me another one too.
- But I didn't want it.
- Come on, let's go to the park.
Wait.
Why didn't you want your dad to buy you any more in the series?
- Race you over there.
- Wait.
It's important I find out why.
- Wait.
It's important for me to know.
- Darrin.
Tell me why you didn't want your dad to buy you any more in the series.
Boy, is that all you can talk about?
Yeah, can't you see we've got better things to do?
How long are you gonna hang upside down?
- Until we start to black out.
- Yeah, it's real neato.
Isn't that sort of dangerous?
What are you, a Boy Scout or something?
- Are you gonna be long, Darrin?
- Let me play a bit longer, Sam.
I bet I can spit further than you.
Just tell me why you didn't buy any more of the models.
I beat you by 2 feet yesterday.
Please.
It's very important for me to know.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Because they don't do nothing.
- You can look at them.
- Big deal.
You can't play with them or nothing.
The boat doesn't even float.
Of course.
That's it.
It's not the campaigns that were wrong.
It's the toys themselves.
In other words, the model should be changed so it does something after it's built.
Look, are you gonna spit with us or not?
Afraid I'll have to take a rain check on that.
Thanks, fellas.
Okay, Sam.
Time for me to grow up.
I've got the solution.
And I don't have to be a kid to sell the idea to Mr. Harding.
Good.
There.
That's more like the man I married.
Well, I'm beginning to get growing pains.
Come on, honey.
I don't know what's holding him up, Mr. Harding.
But I'm sure they'll be here any minute.
Sorry to keep you waiting, gentlemen.
- I've been doing a little research.
- Where's the boy?
Well we don't need him.
- I have the solution - You promised to bring him.
Darrin, I gave my word that the boy would be here.
He is.
Don't you wanna hear my solution?
I'd rather talk to the boy.
You know, I have a very strong hunch about that little fella.
Are you going to take the advice of a 10-year-old boy over mine?
Have you got something against that boy?
- No, of course not.
- You act as though you have.
How can you dislike a bright little fellow like that boy?
I know him a little better than you.
- Look, Darrin.
- What?
Mr. Harding wants to meet the boy.
Yeah, I'll be right back.
Okay, Sam.
Hit me again.
Darling, I thought you had the solution.
They wanna see the kid.
So I'll let him tell him my ideas so they'll believe me.
Oh, dear, out of the mouths of babes.
Please, Sam.
I just wanna get it over with.
Well, okay.
One Master Darrin Stephens coming up.
Ready?
Well, back to the drawing board.
Well, here's the boy we've been waiting for.
All right, after studying the problem from all sides, I suggest Wait a minute.
I think Darrin should hear this.
- Where is he?
- Oh, we don't need him in here.
You've been trying to come up with Excuse me, young fellow but since Mr. Stephens is the account executive I would like him to hear this.
- I'll go get him.
- No!
- That is, I'd rather you didn't.
- What's the matter, son?
Don't you like Mr. Stephens?
Well, I know he's a brilliant advertising man probably the best in the business.
- Then why don't you want him here?
Well l'm not too crazy about him personally.
Well, I still think he should be here.
- I'll just step across the hall and - No.
You sit down.
I'll get him.
That's amazing.
For his age, he's the most mature young fellow I've ever seen.
But I wonder what it is he's got against Darrin Stephens.
I can't imagine.
Oh, excuse me.
I'll just go over and hurry them up.
Sam, this is ridiculous.
They want the two of me in there.
Oh, hi, Sam.
- Well, where's Darrin?
- He just stepped out for a minute.
I'd better go look for him.
You'd better wait in my office.
Sam.
Whatever you say, darling.
There must be some solution to this problem.
Oh, by the I thought you said he stepped outside.
He just stepped back in again.
- Where's the boy?
- He just stepped outside.
Can't I get you two in the same room together?
Larry, we just seem to keep missing each other.
Why don't you go back and talk to Mr. Harding.
We'll both be in in a minute.
Okay.
And you try and pull yourself together, Darrin.
Get on the ball.
Both be in in a minute?
- Darrin, what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill the kid.
Darrin!
I was just speaking figuratively, of course.
I have a certain attachment for that kid.
Okay, honey, once more with feeling.
Mr. Tate, would it be asking too much to get Mr. Stephens and that boy in here?
- Got you.
- I don't think that's funny, sonny.
- Give me that.
- All right.
Bull's-eye.
Right in the kisser.
Get that gun away from him!
- You can't have it.
- Now, look, sonny.
I don't I want my pistol.
- I want my pistol!
I want my pistol!
- Here, here, here.
There's your pistol.
Thank you.
- Get that boy out of here!
- Don't you come near me.
- Where did he go?
- In there.
I wouldn't go in there right now, Larry.
Give him time to calm down.
What happened to him?
Well, you know how it is with these terribly bright kids.
Highly-strung.
- Sometimes they can go just like that.
- Pressure must have got him.
- What about my campaign?
- Mr. Harding, take my advice.
Never send a boy to do a man's job.
- Darrin - Let me finish, Larry.
Mr. Harding, you hired this agency because we're experts in this field.
I did a great deal of research on this project.
The least you can do is listen to me.
All right.
I'll give you 15 minutes.
I hope you know what you're doing.
Say goodbye to the boy for me, will you?
Tell him to come back and see me in about 10 years.
I certainly will.
I bet he'll be the best advertising man in the world.
- Why, thank you, sweetheart.
- Why did you say thank you?
Well, I was just taking a few bows for the kid myself.
Why?
Why?
Oh, call it family pride, Larry.
Family pride, Larry.
I owe a lot to those two kids.
I'd like to do something to repay them.
Hey, lady.
Where's your friend?
- Friend?
- Yeah.
The kid that was here earlier.
He had to leave.
But I'd like to thank you for being so kind to him.
I want to show my appreciation by giving you a present.
What sort of a present?
Well, what would you like?
- A kite.
- A big one.
I think that can be arranged.
Hold out your hands and close your eyes.
Close them.
Hey.
How did you do that?
Take the advice of an old man, don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
I don't know what that means, but thanks, lady.
Yeah, thanks.
You know, Sam, it was kind of fun being a kid again.
I'd kind of like to run and play with those kids.
Don't be too sad about it, darling.
In a few months, you may have a boy of your own to play with.
Come on, Peter Pan, let's go home.
Yippee, lady!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
I know she's a bit vague, but she's never really done anybody any harm.
You sit down and listen to me.
Last week, she insisted on coming to London with Bertha and me.
Halfway there, she started to lose altitude.
- That's terrible.
- Oh, you don't know the half of it!
We had to piggyback her the rest of the way!
Poor Aunt Clara.
Yes, and right in the middle of the convention she waltzes in with a huge doorknob she acquired for her collection.
- That's bad?
- She'd taken it from Buckingham Palace!
That's bad.
One more time.
Abner!
Abner!
Aunt Clara!
What's the matter?
You look upset.
Samantha, I've come to hide out.
Hide out?
Why?
Hedley Partridge is back in town.
Who is he, Aunt Clara?
Well we were close friends.
More than friends.
He was my best beau.
- Aunt Clara, you mean?
- Yes.
Oh, yes, I've had my moments.
One or two.
I'll just bet you did.
Hedley Partridge.
Now I remember him!
Well, I don't see how anyone could forget Hedley.
All I remember is that he was always chasing the girls.
Well, he couldn't help from being popular.
I still don't understand why you don't want to see him.
Oh, well - Endora.
- What?
Haven't you a house to haunt or something?
All right.
All right, Clara.
I'll go.
I think I can skip all the gruesome details of your fly-by-night romance.
I know she's your mother, dear, but she can be trying.
And she insists that I'm in my dotage.
She worries about you, Aunt Clara.
Now tell me, why are you hiding from Mr. Partridge?
Well, I wouldn't admit it to anyone else but some of my spells don't quite work anymore.
- Really?
Well, that's hard to believe.
- Oh, it's true.
It's true.
Well, everybody has their off days.
Well, what's that got to do with Mr. Partridge?
He knew me in my prime.
And you're not anxious to renew the acquaintance.
I wanted him to remember me as I was.
I understand, Aunt Clara.
You can stay here as long as you like.
Thank you, Samantha.
Thank you.
You have a kind and understanding heart.
Abner, I'm telling you, I saw it with my own eyes.
A funny, little old Will you stop playing that flute and listen to me?
!
I've listened.
Twelve times already.
She walked right into the wall and bounced off again!
So any reasonable person would figure it was an accident, right?
But what did you think, Gladys?
An accident the first time.
Then she did it again.
Bang, right into the wall and bounced off again.
And I thought: "Why would anyone wanna bang against a wall"?
Simple.
It feels so good when you stop.
The next time she went right through the wall!
- Well, that makes sense.
- What?
There's no point in banging your head against a brick wall.
I'm beginning to realize that, Abner.
I'm beginning to realize that.
Two visits in one day.
What have I done to deserve this?
Well, it's all set.
Mother has taken care of everything.
Hedley Partridge is coming to dinner tonight.
- Mother, you didn't!
- Well, don't you see?
This could be the solution of our problem.
Aunt Clara needs someone to look after her and Hedley seems to be the perfect candidate.
Aunt Clara and Hedley Partridge, married?
Well, if they want to be stuffy about it, yes.
This could be the romance of the century.
Sort of the Romeo and Juliet of the tired-blood set.
But Aunt Clara doesn't want to see him.
She's embarrassed about her spells not working anymore.
That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard.
Well, that may be, but that's the way she feels.
- I think we should respect her feelings.
- Well, Samantha I can't do everything.
I've done my part.
The rest is up to you.
Now, really, Mother, l Mother!
No, no, I can't see him.
I have to leave.
Aunt Clara, he'll just follow you.
No, no, I'll just Well Everyone into the bag!
Can't rely on them anymore.
Well, you can rely on me.
Aunt Clara, have I ever let you down?
- No, you never have.
- All right, just trust me.
Believe me, Mr. Partridge won't find out anything you don't want him to.
- Enter, dear lady.
- Oh, thank you.
- Who are you?
- I'm Hedley Partridge.
Your mother has told me all about you.
She has?
And I want you to know that I'm on your side.
- You are?
- As long as you love him who cares if he's mortal?
I'm a little confused.
You mean, about my coming here.
Well, I don't blame you.
You see, I was so anxious to see Clara again that I arrived early.
And I found all the doors and windows locked, and no one was about so I took the liberty of making myself at home.
If the doors and windows were locked, how'd you get inside?
Through the wall, of course.
- You're joking, of course.
- Well, of course not.
Well, you needn't look so surprised.
I may have a lot of grey hairs, but I'm still in my prime.
Once a warlock, always a warlock.
My powers are still as good as ever.
- I can see you don't believe me.
- Well Well, I'll show you.
- Did you ever see dancing flowers?
- No.
Watch very carefully.
There, you see?
Well, your wife seems a little highly strung.
That's not my wife.
Congratulations.
My name is Hedley Partridge.
You must be Donald.
- Darrin.
- Well, Endora said it was Donald.
I know.
But it really is Darrin.
- Is it Darrin?
- Yes.
Darrin.
- How are you, Darrin?
- Fine.
How are you, Mr. Partridge?
Aunt Clara and Samantha should be here in a minute.
- Can I fix you a drink?
- Oh, I'd like that.
Yes, yes.
Which?
Oh, thank you.
I'm certainly anxious to see Clara.
Has she changed much?
Well Well, of course, you wouldn't know.
You're a little young.
There was something different about her.
She always had a very special effect upon people.
Well, she hasn't changed in that respect.
Endora talked an awful lot about you.
- Oh, she did, huh?
- But don't worry, young man.
I didn't believe a word of it.
Well, good.
- Soda?
- Just tickle it, yes.
"Warlock: Sorcerer, wizard".
Abner.
There's a wizard at the Stephens' house.
It's good for the lawn.
It eats the mosquitoes.
Not a lizard, a wizard.
Wizard, lizard, as long as it eats the mosquitoes.
Here they are now.
- How do I look?
Is my tie all right?
- Oh, of course.
Hi, darling.
I'm terribly sorry we're late, but I just Sam this is Mr. Partridge.
Hello, Clara.
Hello, Hedley.
Clara, you haven't changed a bit.
- Oh, Hedley.
- No, no, I mean it.
I mean it.
You're just as beautiful as ever.
Oh, now, you didn't have to say that, you know.
- Did I ever lie to you?
- Constantly.
But I still like it.
And you must be Samantha.
Well, good looks obviously runs in the family.
Well, thank you, Mr. Partridge.
Now, Aunt Clara why don't you and Mr. Partridge sit down and get reacquainted.
I'll get dinner ready.
It'll only take a second.
Darrin.
Darrin.
Just give a shout if anybody needs my help.
What for?
Okay.
Sure, sure.
- How have you been, dear?
- Oh, fine.
Just fine.
Oh, that's good.
Good.
- And you?
- Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
My powers are as good as ever.
Watch.
How about that?
Oh, remarkable.
Remarkable.
Of course, witchcraft is a gift, you know.
But you've got to keep practicing at it.
If you don't, your spells get sloppy.
And when that happens, believe me, you know you're getting old.
- Isn't that right, Clara?
- Oh, yes.
Well Well, it does happen.
- It happens to all of us.
- Yes, yes.
I know, I know.
Speaking about that, do you remember Seranda Ethrington?
Oh, very well.
You always said she had such pretty hair.
Well, I only said that to make you jealous, that's all.
However, I think she's bald now.
Oh, good.
Oh, you don't say so.
Do you know what I heard?
I heard that she can't even walk through a wall anymore.
Poor dear.
Yeah, practically knocked herself senseless every time she tried it.
It got so bad that her daughter had to put her in the old witches' home.
- Pathetic case.
- Oh, it certainly is.
Imagine.
Can't even walk through a wall, I mean But that will never happen to us, will it, dear, huh?
- Not to the golden couple.
- That's right.
That's what they used to call us when we were younger, you know.
- The golden couple - Well, here's your drink.
Oh, thank you, thank you.
You know what Endora told me about you?
- No.
- She said you were still the fastest witch in the West.
- Oh, no.
- Do you mind if I smoke a cigar?
- Oh, certainly not.
- I'll get you one.
- Oh, no, no.
I'll get one.
- Have you got a light, Clara?
- I've got one right here.
No, no.
This is something Clara used to do for me.
Do you remember, Clara?
Well, now, how about it?
Will you, for old times' sake?
Well, I'll try.
- I'll try.
- "Try," she said.
Wait till you see this, young man.
Oh, Sam!
By George, Endora was right!
You are still amazing.
Dinner will be ready in a minute.
- Would you like an ashtray?
- An ashtray?
- I'll get it, Aunt Clara.
- No, no.
I can send it over myself.
Oh, I did it!
I made a comeback.
I made a comeback!
I thought you might like to nibble on these before dinner.
Thank you.
Do you want another ashtray?
No, no.
One is sufficient, thank you.
Are you sure?
Because there's no trouble to send over another one.
Now, Aunt Clara, you know how Darrin feels about witchcraft in this house.
Now you two sit here and talk about old times.
Darrin?
Would you like to help me?
Sure.
Sure, honey.
- Will you have an hors d'oeuvre?
- Love it.
Everything seems to be going awfully well, doesn't it?
Maybe you should've told Aunt Clara you were doing her spells.
Oh, her pride would never let her agree to it.
Don't worry, darling.
Everything's under control.
Good, huh?
Oh, easy.
You remember, Clara how we used to turn ourselves into nightingales and serenade the young lovers?
- Oh, yes.
Oh, yes!
That was the first nightingale that was ever heard in Berkeley Square.
Yeah, that's right.
- Those were the good old days, huh?
- Oh, yes, they were.
- Well, why don't we do it again?
- Oh, no, no.
I don't think so, dear.
- No.
- Oh, yes.
No, no.
I don't think so.
But we have 15 minutes before dinner.
I know, Clara.
But that was a long time ago, and l - No.
- But I remember the spell perfectly.
- Now, are you game?
- Well, yes.
- You know me.
I'm game for anything.
- Oh, good.
Right.
Well, now, let's see Aunt Clara, Sam said if you'd like - What's that?
- Hedley.
- Everything went wrong.
- Sam.
Sam!
Aunt Clara, what did you do?
Why, I don't understand.
I thought it had all come back to me.
Aunt Clara, Sam was helping you with your spells.
Helping me?
You mean the witchcraft didn't come back?
- I'm sorry, Aunt Clara.
Now, you just sit down and try to relax.
I'll see if I can get everything back to normal.
I can't sit down.
I have nothing to sit down on.
Don't panic.
Just try and remember the right spell.
Oh, I'll never be able to look Hedley in the face again.
Never.
Never.
We knocked, but I guess Abner, see?
I suppose you folks are wondering why we have an elephant here in our living room.
Well, the thought had crossed my mind.
Well, you see, I'm doing a campaign for men's swimsuits.
- Swimsuits?
- Trunks, trunks.
Yes, and he's using him as a model.
- A model?
- Yes.
For the trademark: "You'll never forget our trunks".
Abner, there's the wall woman.
- Gladys, we never met the lady.
- Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
Aunt Clara, this is Mr. And Mrs. Kravitz.
Well, how do you do?
- That's it!
That's it!
- I beg your pardon?
Aunt Clara is a linguist.
That means "bless your face" in Malayan.
- Thank you, Aunt Clara.
- Don't do it in here.
I never could look Hedley in the face again.
Don't worry.
I'll take him in the kitchen.
Where is the wiz - the gentleman I met earlier this evening?
He's in the kitchen.
Now just relax, Mr. Partridge.
Now that I know the spell, I can reverse it.
Thank goodness.
Clara sure made a mess of that one, didn't she, huh?
You know, Endora lied to me about her.
Mr. Partridge, please, it was really all my fault.
No, I don't care what you say, I'm gonna have a talk with that young lady.
Oh, dear.
That's the wizard!
- Mr. Partridge, Mr. And Mrs. Kravitz.
- How do you do?
Clara, may I speak with you a moment?
- No, no, I have to go.
- No, Clara, please Oh, dear.
Did you hurt yourself?
- Are you all right?
- I'm all I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Remember Seranda Ethrington, dear.
You mustn't do those things.
Aunt Clara's rather nearsighted.
Yes, I told you, Aunt Clara.
You really should wear your glasses.
- Yes.
- See, I told you.
There's a logical explanation for everything.
I suppose there's also a logical explanation for dancing flowers.
Oh, Gladys, will you stop?
Mr. Partridge did you make those flowers dance or not?
- Yes, I did.
- See, he admits it!
Now, I suppose you have a logical explanation for that, Abner.
I think he might if he examined the flowers.
- These flowers are rigged.
- Rigged?
Yeah.
The flowers have a wire attached to them.
You just pull this wire, and they dance.
- Is that how you did it, Mr. Partridge?
- Yes, that's right.
I take it you're some kind of a magician.
I used to be.
Well, we'd better be going.
Come on, Gladys.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Now, you said you got into the house by walking through the wall.
Now, is that true?
No, that's not true.
No.
The kitchen window was open, and I climbed in.
Pathetic, isn't it?
It certainly is.
You have a weird sense of humour.
Come on, Gladys.
Darrin I need some help in the kitchen with the turnips.
- What help do turnips need?
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Hedley you too?
- That's right.
Yeah.
I haven't performed real witchcraft for years, dear.
I can't even do the little things anymore.
Neither can I. Samantha did all the other things earlier.
- Yes.
- So you and I are paddling the same canoe, huh?
Oh, it's not so bad when you get used to it.
Oh, I know.
I don't mind, really.
Not really.
You know, you can't fight old age.
But when Endora told me that you hadn't aged at all well, I'm afraid my pride got the better of me.
- Oh, no.
- You understand that, huh?
I understand.
Hedley, I I'm sorry I turned you into an elephant and all that.
Oh, that's all right.
Don't worry about it.
- It happens to the best of us.
- Oh, well, yes.
I suppose.
Let's you and I have another sip, huh?
Oh, yes.
I'm so glad everything went so well for Aunt Clara.
Do I detect a matchmaking gleam in your eye?
Oh, no, of course not.
But it would be nice - What's the matter?
- Orange blossoms.
The whole house smells of orange blossoms.
- Sam!
- I've had nothing to do with it.
You know, it was so nice to see Hedley again.
It's a pity he had to leave town tonight.
He told me he had to make some calls in other cities.
Yes.
Yes.
He's in the magic-supply business.
Isn't that nice?
Of course, I mean, it isn't witchcraft but at least it's an allied line.
You sure you're not really sorry to see him go?
Well, he's going to take me dancing next week.
- Really?
- Oh, yes.
And And he left me something to remember him by.
A doorknob.
Oh, Aunt Clara, it's lovely!
- Lovely.
- Oh, yes.
Oh, it's much better than an engagement ring.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Hey, Abner.
Abner, come here quick.
How about that?
Kind of funny, people like that going into the Stephens' house.
- They look normal to me.
- That's what's funny about it.
Wally, Margaret.
What a surprise.
How are you, Samantha?
Wally, what a silly question.
Need you ask?
Oh, hey, congratulations!
Oh, thank you.
We're very happy about it.
Do come in.
Don't tell me this is Merle.
Yeah, it's me.
How I've grown, right?
Right.
Sit down, sit down.
Why don't you have some coffee.
No.
We'd love to, but we're really in a terrible hurry.
No, no.
I haven't seen you for ages.
Merle, would you like some cake?
Gee, yeah.
Do you have chocolate?
Kitchen's right in there.
Just help yourself.
- Well, he did that very well.
- He's learning.
Too bad you don't like chocolate, Merle.
It's delicious.
What brings you to this part of the world?
Didn't Endora tell you?
- Tell me what?
- Oh, great.
What's the matter?
Well, Wally and I have to attend an important conclave in London.
All our usual sitters fell through, and we didn't know what to do.
So Well, luckily, we bumped into Endora.
We'd never have thought of asking you, but she said you wouldn't mind.
- Mind what?
- She said you wouldn't mind taking care of Merle while we were gone.
Oh, it isn't that.
It's It's my husband.
- He doesn't like kids?
- Oh, no.
No, no.
He loves them.
It's just that, well, Darrin's had some rather nasty experiences with my friends and relatives and he's been working so hard lately, I hate to Well, he's mortal, you know.
- Yes, Endora told us.
- Oh, that shouldn't be a problem.
Merle can pass for a mortal.
Can't you, Merle?
- Sure.
- Will you promise not to do any magic in front of Mr. Stephens?
- Okay.
Well, in that case, I I guess it's all right.
Thanks, Samantha.
I'm sure he'll be no trouble.
He's got a lot of studying to do.
What are you working on now, Merle?
- Elementary spells and incantations.
- You're not to help him, Samantha.
Oh, don't worry.
I won't.
Well, thanks again, Samantha.
We really appreciate it.
And you behave yourself and do everything Mr. And Mrs. Stephens tells you.
Give Mother a kiss.
Mom Well, we'd better take off.
See you tomorrow.
- So long, Mom.
So long, Dad.
- Have a good time.
All right, Merle.
I'll show you your room.
That's Gladys Kravitz.
Hey, can you see through walls?
I can't seem to get the hang of it.
No magic involved, Merle.
I just know from the knock and the timing.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
What a surprise.
I came over for a snoop of A scoop of sugar.
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
No, no.
- Oh, hi, young man.
- Hi.
This is Merle.
He's come to spend a day or two.
Did your parents bring you?
I'd be pleased to meet them.
- They've already left.
- Oh, they couldn't.
I was watching.
I mean, you sure they're not still here?
- Positive.
- They went through the roof.
- They went through the roof?
- Would you like your sugar?
No.
No.
No, I've got plenty at home, thanks.
Hey, she's pretty weird, even for a mortal.
- Oh, no, Larry.
You paid last Saturday.
- No, no.
You did.
No, I'm sure you did, Larry.
All right, I'll toss you for it.
Loser pays.
- Okay.
- All right, call it.
Heads.
I don't see it.
It must have rolled under the bar.
Well, it was your 50 cents, so I'll pay.
What time do you want us there tomorrow night?
About 8:30.
Louise is getting a little touchy about her birthday but she always likes to see you and Sam.
I guess this is yours.
Thanks.
It was heads.
Thanks.
Oh, I want to show you the necklace I got for Louise's birthday.
Hey, that's beautiful.
She know about it?
No, I just got it today, so she hasn't had a chance to find it.
You know, she always snoops around.
So that by the time I give her her present, it's never a surprise.
I've got it.
Darrin would you keep this for me until tomorrow night?
- I'll be glad to.
- Thank you.
- Anybody home?
- Yeah.
Hi.
I'm Merle Brocken, Mr. Stephens.
- Well, glad to know you, Merle.
- Hi, darling.
- I see the two of you've met.
- Yes.
- Merle's gonna be with us for a while.
- He is?
His parents had to go away overnight and they wanted to know if Merle could stay here, okay?
Fine.
New family in the neighbourhood?
- You might say that.
- I did say that.
So you did.
Merle, why don't you run outside and play for a while.
You mean, you want me to have fun?
- Yeah, that's the general idea.
- Whatever you say, Mrs. Stephens.
It's a pity he didn't bring any toys with him.
Seems like a nice kid.
- What's that?
- It's a necklace Larry bought for Louise's birthday.
He asked me to keep it for him till tomorrow.
Honey.
You sure you don't mind Merle's being here?
Why should I mind?
Seems like a nice, normal little boy.
- Hey, sonny.
- Yes, ma'am?
Water just came out your ears.
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well, how do you explain that?
- I was in swimming yesterday.
- I see.
Do you like staying with the Stephens?
Oh, they're real nice people.
Did you notice anything strange about them?
No.
Excuse me.
I'm supposed to be having fun.
- Hi, Merle.
You weren't out very long.
- There wasn't anybody to play with.
Well, you want to play catch with me?
I don't know how.
- Didn't your father ever teach you?
- No.
He's travelling all the time.
Come on.
I think I can make a ball player out of you before supper.
See?
Pops right in there.
Don't be afraid to throw the ball just as hard as you can.
I'm sure you'll catch on pretty quick.
Well, let's toss it around a bit.
Bat there.
Why don't you stand over here, and I'll go on down the road a piece.
Okay, it's coming in.
Good catch.
Okay, now, let's have it.
Burn one in, Merle.
Burn one in.
Let's have it.
Let me have it.
Let me have it.
Did you say you?
You never played before?
That's right, Mr. Stephens.
But it's not so hard to do.
Well, let's see how you can do with the bat.
Why don't you pick it up and I'll pitch you a few.
- Okay, Mr. Stephens.
Now, don't be disappointed if you miss the first couple, okay?
You set?
Here you go.
Is that what you wanted me to do, Mr. Stephens?
Did you ever think about being a ball player?
No.
What for?
A lot of kids dream about being in the major leagues.
You could be.
I suppose so, but I don't really wanna be.
- What do you want to do?
- I wanna be like my father.
Well, I can't argue with that.
Abner!
Abner!
The kid from across the street broke our window with his baseball!
Abner!
Abner!
- Is this the one he broke?
- I saw it with my own eyes!
Gladys, you must have your contact lenses reversed.
What are you reading, Merle?
That book about space travel you had on the shelf.
The one over there, where you hid the necklace.
I didn't know that was a funny book.
Oh, it's not meant to be, but it is.
Look at this one.
Oh, boy.
- Eat your dinner.
- No, thanks.
I don't like meat loaf.
Unfortunately, Merle, this is not a restaurant and meat loaf is all we have on the menu tonight.
- I didn't think it was a restaurant, sir.
- Well, put the book aside and eat.
This is a dining room, not a library.
I didn't think it was a library either, sir.
In this house, when someone reads, they read in the other room.
Yes, sir.
Thank you very much.
That's a very hard boy to criticize.
He's so polite.
- I wouldn't criticize him, darling.
- Why not?
Well Honey, a little constructive criticism never hurt anyone.
Well, he's only gonna be here overnight.
Sam, that's not the point.
While he is here, I expect him to behave like any other well-mannered boy.
He's very well-mannered.
Finish your dinner and forget about it.
Right.
Mama.
Mama.
I got it!
I got it!
- Hi, Merle.
- Hi, Mr. Stephens.
Merle, I'd like to have a little talk with you.
You know, it's through the little things in life that we learn about the big things.
Now take, for instance, that meat loaf.
- Merle, what's that?
- It's really a hairbrush.
Let's not have any games, Merle.
I happen to know you didn't bring any toys with you.
Now, did you just happen to find that in some other boy's yard?
No!
It's mine.
Merle, I'm sure you think it's yours.
But until I'm sure l'd better take charge of it.
What happened?
He tried to take my fire truck that I made out of a hairbrush.
- So I stopped him.
- Is he a?
Yes.
A plain, simple, ordinary, everyday little warlock.
A warlock?
Sam, why didn't you tell me?
- I didn't wanna make you nervous.
- Fine.
Next time, just blurt it out, huh?
It was an emergency.
I wouldn't ordinarily have done this without asking first.
But it's only overnight, I didn't expect any trouble.
I like surprises as much as the next fellow I am furious with you.
You promised, no witchcraft.
First you misbehaved at the table, and then here.
Misbehaved?
He darn near electrocuted me.
Well, he tried to take my fire engine, and I don't like meat loaf.
March.
March!
Come on, darling.
Eat.
First time I ever saw a meat loaf with strawberry and whipped cream.
Merle.
Meat loaf.
That's right.
Next stop, spinach.
The whole plateful.
I think you're outclassed, Merle.
Don't you dare.
Let me remind you, young man that I am older and more experienced than you.
And anything you can do, I can do an awful lot better.
Okay, I give up.
And I want you to promise, no more witchcraft while you're in this house.
- Gee whiz.
- You heard me.
But as long as he knows, what's the difference?
That's it, Merle.
Okay.
But what about my fire engine?
Do I get to keep it?
Darrin will decide whether you keep it or not.
Why him?
Who's he?
He is my husband and the master of this house, that's who.
Why don't you try a little smile, Merle.
Stop!
Put up your hands, or I'll shout Or I'll shoot!
Now what?
- Now, where's the necklace?
- I can't tell you.
It belongs to my boss.
It's a present for his wife.
Tell me where it is and let me get out of here.
I'm getting nervous.
Hi.
Hi, Mr. Stephens.
I thought I heard you talking down here.
All right, all right.
What's the idea, sneaking up behind me like that?
Hey, are you a burglar?
I bet you came for that necklace in here.
Yeah, kid.
That's right.
You know where it is?
Sure.
Come on, Merle.
Let him have it!
You know what I mean.
Gee, I'd like to, but I really promised Mrs. Stephens I wouldn't.
Don't you remember?
Well, here it is.
- Thanks for your cooperation.
- You're welcome.
I'm sorry, Mr. Stephens, but I gave my word.
Thanks, kid.
Okay, so you got the necklace.
Why don't you take the fire engine.
You're probably mean enough to.
You know, you're right.
I am.
And my nephew has got a birthday coming up.
Leave it alone, it's mine.
- Knock it off, kid.
- Don't you touch it.
I'm warning you.
Stop!
Stop!
Help!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Stop it!
Help!
Somebody help me!
Police!
Police!
I would've gotten away, but I was surrounded by that fire truck.
I heard it with my own ears.
Kept chasing me, squirting water at me.
That's right.
- That's the way it is with fire trucks.
- What do you mean?
Look, come on, buddy.
You can tell your story to the sergeant.
You'll brighten up the whole night for him.
Good night.
I'm sorry I broke my promise, Mrs. Stephens.
Well, that's all right, Merle.
I'm glad you did.
I bet this is the first time a burglar was ever captured by a hairbrush.
That's right.
A hairbrush?
What hairbrush?
I never saw a hairbrush.
It was a fire truck.
What are you talking about?
This is the silliest thing I ever heard of.
A hairbrush?
Samantha, I'll get you a new hairbrush to replace that one.
Don't bother.
It was a pleasure having Merle.
It was very educational.
Did he behave himself?
He was just fine.
Well, let's go, Walter.
I'm anxious to get home.
Hi there.
Hi.
Hello, Merle.
Are these your parents?
I'm Gladys Kravitz from across the street.
You ought to have Merle's ears looked at.
He's been having trouble with them.
Honestly.
I was so excited after what happened last night I couldn't sleep another wink.
People say, " How can you live in that dull neighbourhood"?
But I don't think it's dull at all.
You folks should have Hey!
Where are they?
Where'd they go?
They were here just a second ago.
They walked down the street and then went around the corner while you were talking, Mrs. Kravitz.
Well, I wasn't talking that long.
Was I?
Was I?
Or was I?
Well, I guess I was.
L Come on in the house, Mrs. Kravitz.
I'll give you a scoop of sugar.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
You were up early this morning, huh?
What were you doing in the den?
Darrin?
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Oh, just what I need.
Ketchup with my oatmeal.
Big day today, sweetheart?
Good.
Have a nice time.
I have a feeling I'm not getting through to you.
I'm sorry, honey.
I'm worried about a presentation I have to make to a client today.
Problems with the campaign?
Well, with a little bit of work, it could be mediocre.
Can't you postpone the meeting?
He's only in town for one day.
I even got up early today to try to come up with some new ideas for his product.
- Oh, honey - That's it.
- What?
- Honey.
That's the product.
Sorry.
Your cousin Miranda is going to get married and we're going to the wedding, so be ready to leave tonight.
Don't you ever say hello?
You'll enjoy a vacation from this suburban prison.
Mother, I can't go.
The Tates are coming for dinner.
Anyway, I couldn't leave Darrin alone.
You know, Samantha, your devotion to that mortal is absolutely pathetic.
Well, I suppose we could drag him along.
Show him how the elite live.
Oh, I don't think so, Mother.
Besides, Darrin is very busy.
And I've Derwood, we're all going to a wedding.
So you better arrange to take two days off from whatever it is you do.
Don't you ever say hello?
Darrin, you think you could get a couple of days off?
I'm afraid not, honey.
I'm snowed under with work.
I'm sure Larry wouldn't let me off.
- Oh, I can take care of that.
- Oh, how?
Well, I'll simply turn Mr. Tate into an inanimate object for two days.
He'll never know you've gone away.
- Mother.
- Well, it was just an idea.
Let's keep it that way.
I'm afraid you'll have to count us out, Endora.
Oh, don't give up so easily.
I don't.
You know the trouble with your mother?
She's here today, and here tomorrow.
See you tonight.
Endora!
What a coincidence seeing you here.
Well, let's say a surprise.
A very pleasant one, I hope.
I've never had a day spoiled by an attractive woman.
Oh, Mr. Tate.
As a matter of fact, I've often told Darrin he should be glad he has such a charming mother-in-law.
You should meet Louise's mother.
A real witch.
Well, it happens in the best of families.
I'm glad that we happened to meet, Mr. Tate.
I wanted to ask a favour of you.
Well, fire away.
I'd like to take Samantha and her husband out of town to attend a very special family function.
I'd really appreciate it if you could spare him from the office for two days.
Well, if it means that much to you, of course I can.
Oh, thank you.
I'll try to repay you sometime.
Oh, that won't be necessary.
Well, I'm afraid I have to run.
I was hoping to pick up a teddy bear for my son, but they're all out of them.
Well, there seem to be plenty around.
Oh, no.
I need one like this.
It nods its head when you press its toe.
This was taken with my son.
Oh, he has lovely brown eyes.
Oh, he was very fond of that teddy bear.
So fond that last night, it finally disintegrated under the constant affection.
How sweet.
I promised him I'd get another one like it.
Well, if I happen to run across one, I'll let you know.
Thank you.
- Nice seeing you, Endora.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Mr. Tate.
Bye-bye.
Is Mr. Tate in?
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
He's out.
When do you expect him?
I doubt he'll be back today.
He has a number of calls to make.
- Can I help you?
- Yes.
I'd like to send this to Mrs. Tate with my compliments.
Oh, isn't he cute.
What is your name, please?
Endora.
Endora.
And your last name?
Betty, do you have the charts on the Harper account?
- Oh, right here, Mr. Stephens.
- I'll get them.
You know, a psychiatrist could cure you of an attachment like that.
Oh, it isn't mine.
It's a gift for Mrs. Tate.
It's an unusual gift.
Well, the lady who delivered it wasn't exactly run-of-the-mill either.
Very striking, with red hair.
Odd name too.
Idora or Andora - Endora?
- Yeah, that's right.
Endora.
- What did she say?
- Told me to send this to Mrs. Tate with her compliments.
- Let me have that.
- Kind of cute, isn't he?
It's easy to see how people can become so attached to inanimate objects.
Oh, she couldn't.
A lot of other things, but not this.
Are you all right, Mr. Stephens?
Have?
Have you seen Mr. Tate today?
No, I haven't.
He was supposed to phone, but I haven't heard a word.
Well, I better put this in a box, and No!
I'll I'll keep him.
- What?
- I'll take care of it.
Gee, I don't know, Mr. Stephens.
I was supposed to send it to his home.
I don't want Mr. Tate mad at me.
- You know what a bear he can be.
- Betty, that's not funny.
Did I say something wrong?
No, of course not.
Just let us have a few minutes alone.
I mean, will you excuse us?
Me?
Sure, Mr. Stephens.
Sure.
Larry?
Larry, is that you?
Larry, is it you?
Did Endora turn you into a teddy bear?
Larry, nod your head if you understand.
Oh, Larry.
Mother, will you stop playing games?
I can't talk with that infernal din.
Now start packing, Samantha.
You're leaving tomorrow.
I told you, Larry will not let Darrin go.
But I saw Mr. Tate, and everything's taken care of.
- Mother - I can't stay now.
I'll be back soon.
I'm off to get a new wardrobe.
Wait Hold on, Lar.
Don't give up the ship.
Hello, Sam?
Have you seen your mother?
Yes.
She just left.
Why?
Did she say anything about Larry?
Well, she said something about having seen him and having taken care of everything.
Taken care of everything?
I don't really know what she was talking about.
- Have you seen Larry?
- I'm holding him in my arms.
Oh, well, then ask him - What?
- Sam, she did it.
She did it.
Put Larry in your arms?
She turned him into a teddy bear.
A teddy bear?
Darrin, are you sure?
Don't you think I know a teddy bear when I see one?
Oh, this is terrible.
You have to get ahold of her.
She has to take this spell off.
Oh, but, Darrin, I don't know where she is.
She went on a shopping spree.
We have to wait till she gets back.
Well, what am I supposed to do in the meantime?
Look, darling, just keep him warm and let him know you care.
That is, that you're trying to do something about his condition.
Try not to worry too much.
I'll phone you as soon as Mother shows up.
All right, sweetheart.
Well, Lar.
You certainly look warm enough.
And you heard what Sam said.
We'll have you back to normal in no time.
Do you understand?
Do you understand?
Larry, you have every right to be sore at me, but at least speak to me.
Are you kidding?
You spoke.
You spoke to me.
Hardly.
I think he's in hibernation this time of year.
I'm sorry, Mr. Stephens.
Mr. Harper said he couldn't wait any longer.
As you know, my time is somewhat limited.
Yes, of course, Mr. Harper.
Thank you.
Thank you, Betty.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Harper.
I think you met my assistant, Ted Bertram, last time he was in town.
- Yes.
How are you, Ted?
- Nice to see you again.
This is the young lady who will help us demonstrate our product.
Oh, we met outside.
Yes, we certainly did.
Well, now that we've all met, won't you sit down?
- Oh, thank you.
- Diane?
Now We haven't met your friend.
Friend?
I guess you're wondering why I was talking to this teddy bear.
Well, we all have our hang-ups, Darrin.
Yes.
Well it's my hobby.
Ventriloquism.
I was practicing.
You must have a very funny act.
Yes.
Well, I'll just be a moment.
Doesn't look like a ventriloquist's dummy.
Seems to be just an ordinary teddy bear.
Well, I was only using that Don't hold him like that.
- All the blood will rush to his head.
- What?
Are his eyes bloodshot?
It's nice to have a client with a good sense of humour, huh?
I would like to call your attention to the story-bear.
Board.
I'll have Diane read the copy for you later but right now, I would like to tell you some of our ideas.
- "Our" ideas?
- Yes.
Larry Tate's and mine.
I'm only interested in hearing your ideas, Darrin.
You see, we're a young, progressive company.
And frankly, I think Mr. Tate's ideas are a bit too fuddy-duddy for us.
Well, you're wrong, Mr. Harper.
You're dead wrong.
Some of Larry Tate's ideas are very creative.
I'd say brilliant.
I'm sure that Mr. Tate's work is quite competent in some areas but not for us.
You see, we're looking for something fresh and imaginative.
And I find that old-timers like Tate Well, they're old hat, stale.
Their ideas lack style.
And why are you doing that?
Doing what?
Would you please put down that teddy bear?
It's rather distracting.
Here.
Let me hold him.
He's so cute and cuddly.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Why?
- He bites.
He sheds.
Could we forget about the teddy bear and get on with the presentation?
Of course.
Excuse me.
Is that you, Sam?
The model's dress is here.
Look, Betty, the only person I wanna speak to is my wife.
Excuse me.
I'll go change.
Would you please keep the line open?
Thank you.
I'm sorry, but - Where's Diane?
- I think she went to change into her costume.
- What'd she do with Larry?
- Larry?
- Teddy.
I mean the teddy bear.
She took it in the changing room with her.
She can't do that.
- Darrin!
- I've gotta get that teddy bear back.
Ted, I don't wanna be an alarmist but I have a sinking feeling that we're doing business with a first-class fruitcake.
- Diane?
- Yes.
Have you got a teddy bear in there with you?
Yes.
Why?
He can't stay in there.
Give him to me.
Do you have to have him right now?
I don't have any clothes on.
Just get him out of there.
Did you have to do that?
Are you all right?
No heartbeat.
- Do you hear anything?
- Mr. Stephens teddy bears don't have heartbeats.
Look, can we get on with this meeting?
- Oh, yes, certain - No.
Leave the teddy bear.
You don't understand, Mr. Harper.
He's sort of a mascot.
Look, Mr. Stephens, you don't need luck to sell us this campaign, do you?
- No, of course not.
- I'll take care of him, Mr. Stephens.
All right, but don't let him out of sight.
Sure, Mr. Stephens.
Look, I'll put him right in this drawer.
No!
No, you'll cut off his air.
Put him right here on the desk.
And don't touch him.
Are you ready?
Or do you wanna get into your Doctor Dentons?
The costume is very nice, Diane.
Hi, Betty.
Is my husband in?
No, he's been out all day, Mrs. Tate.
Well, never mind.
I'll Oh, no.
Larry must have bought one too.
I've been looking all over for one just like this and finally located one half an hour ago.
Well, I was supposed to send this to your house.
A lady named Endora said to send it to you with her compliments.
Oh, how sweet of her.
I wonder how she knew we were looking for one.
- Cute, isn't it?
- Yeah.
Well, we can't use two of these.
He must have come from Tippet's Toy Shop.
It's the only place in town that has them in.
I told them to send the bear I bought to our house, so I'll return this one.
We'll just treat the other one as a gift.
Want me to give Mr. Tate any message when he phones?
Oh, no.
I'll be busy all day too.
Tell him to meet me at the Stephens' tonight.
All right, Mrs. Tate.
Darrin, why did you want me to meet you here?
Louise returned Larry to this store.
He's here somewhere.
Take it easy.
We'll find him, get him home.
Mother will be there, and everything will be normal.
- Oh, no, it won't.
- Why not?
What do the words "nervous breakdown" mean to you?
Excuse me?
Did a brunet lady return a teddy bear a little while ago?
Yes.
Why?
Well, he's a very special bear.
I mean, he has great sentimental value.
Would you mind telling us where you put him?
- On the shelf over there.
- Thank you.
Don't worry, darling.
We'll have him home safe and sound in - Can't you tell which one's him?
- Not a chance.
Honey, maybe you can contact him.
After all, you are a A witch.
Larry.
Larry.
Which one of you is Larry Tate?
Larry.
Larry.
- Is that you, Larry?
- Larry.
Hey, Lar.
Give us a sign.
Larry.
Larry?
Darrin, that must be him.
He nodded.
Lady, they all nod.
- They do?
- It's a button in his toe.
Can you remember which one the lady returned?
I'm sorry.
You sure?
Look, do you wanna make a purchase or not?
Yes.
We'll take all these teddy bears.
Mister, there are I know.
We're having a picnic.
A teddy bears' picnic.
Honey, they all look absolutely identical.
Isn't there any way we can tell which one is Larry?
Hasn't he got a mole or something?
Who notices moles?
Larry.
- Darrin.
- Lar What?
Darrin, this must be Larry.
How can you tell?
He's the only one that doesn't have "Made in Japan" on his Here.
And he doesn't have this little tag either.
You're right.
It must be him.
Larry, are you all right?
I better get these out of the way so we don't get him mixed up again.
It's a good idea.
I wish you wouldn't keep staring at me with those unblinking eyes.
They're all sort of accusing.
Oh, darling, I'm sure it's nothing but your imagination.
Bears don't bear grudges.
At least I don't think they do.
Are you sure your mother's the only one that can reverse the spell?
Yeah, I'm afraid so.
I suppose I could try.
But not knowing the spell, there's no telling what would happen.
And I'd hate to end up with a live bear in the living room.
This time she did it.
This time she really did it.
Well, Darwin.
Ready for your afternoon nap?
You ought to be arrested and locked up.
Don't you ever say hello?
Know what you could get for turning a man into a teddy bear?
I have no idea.
But I can imagine they'd have a hard time finding a precedent.
You know what you are?
You're a childish, irresponsible, old witch.
- Darrin.
Now, I know you're upset.
- Upset?
!
She turned my boss into a teddy bear just to satisfy a selfish whim.
It's time you thought of somebody besides yourself.
Are you quite through?
No, I'm not.
You better do something about him.
Certainly.
So much for your boss.
She murdered him.
I don't believe it.
Oh, Mother wouldn't.
Sam Sam, call a doctor.
- A doctor?
- Sam, call a doctor.
He may still be alive.
Call a doctor before he dies from a loss of stuffing.
I can't believe that Mother would do something like that.
How can you say that with Larry all over the table?
I rang twice, but nobody Hey, looks like you had a little accident.
Is Larry here yet?
Is something the matter?
Matter?
No.
No, you just caught us in the middle of something.
You want me to help you clean up that mess?
We were just going to try and put him back together.
Listen, forget it.
Whatever that was originally, it's beyond repair now.
But I'll help you clean it up, thou Hey, that looks familiar.
Familiar?
Our little boy has a teddy bear.
Sam, I can't stand it any longer.
- I have to tell her.
- Darrin.
- I don't think you should rush into this.
- Sam, it's the only decent thing to do.
Louise, sit down.
But what is this?
Louise, these pitiful bits of cotton and fuzz are all that's left of dear Larry!
- Larry!
- What's the matter with you, Darrin?
You act as though I just returned from the dead.
Larry, is it really you?
If it really is you, nod your head.
- Is he kidding?
- Darrin, maybe you ought to sit down.
He's had a hard day.
Well, it couldn't have been any worse than my day.
How do you mean?
Oh, you know, one meeting after another.
Hi, Louise.
Who knocked the stuffing out of that teddy bear?
Oh, it's a long story.
Well, he looks like I feel.
I think we could all use a little drink before dinner, don't you?
- Hear, hear.
- Don't you?
By all means.
Eat, drink and be merry.
For tomorrow, I apologize to your mother.
I think Mother accepted your apology rather graciously, don't you?
Yes.
Although I did have a little trouble getting to my feet after being in that kneeling position for so long.
Well, the only problem we have now is what to do with 23 teddy bears.
That is not the only problem.
I'd also like to convince Larry and Mr. Harper that just because I bought Twenty-four teddy bears all nodding yes.
Twenty-four teddy bears all nodding yes?
Yes, don't you see?
Bears?
Honey?
Twenty-four teddy bears all nodding yes to a jar of Harper's honey.
I might be able to get him before he leaves for the airport.
At least it'll be a good excuse for me being so preoccupied with bears.
Mr. Harper, please.
He has?
He just left three minutes ago.
Are you absolutely sure he checked out of the hotel?
He is?
Great.
- I just got a lucky break.
- He's coming back into the hotel.
He's heading back to the desk right How did you know that?
Would you believe me if I said it was intuition?
Of course.
But just this once.
Hello, Mr. Harper.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Darrin, is that you?
- No, I left half an hour ago.
Hey.
Hey, sleepyhead.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
I meant to get up and fix your breakfast.
You were sleeping soundly and looked so beautiful I just couldn't wake you.
I'm not beautiful.
I'm sleepy and I look awful.
Not to me, you don't.
You look more beautiful every day.
- Do I really?
- Of course you do.
I'll try to get home early tonight.
The Hotchkisses and the Tates are coming for dinner.
And I'm looking forward to them seeing my beautiful wife.
I'll see you tonight.
Mirror, mirror, on the wall who's the most gullible of all?
Mother.
What do you mean, gullible?
You're getting more and more human every day, Samantha.
- Thank you.
- The way you lap up that treacle it's just pathetic.
I may not be appealing to you, Mother, but Darrin thinks I'm beautiful.
Oh, he's not telling the truth, and you know it.
Thank you, Mother.
You do say the nicest things.
Human beings can't get along without lying to each other.
If they're forced to tell the truth, it's instant chaos.
That's not true.
Nonsense.
They're all the same.
Every one of them, including your precious Dobkin.
That's enough, Mother.
Very well, dear.
You'll see.
All right, Hagatha.
Here it is, Endora.
I'm so glad I had one in stock for you.
These little truth gods are hard to find.
I knew if anyone would have it in her shop, you would.
Nobody seems to be making them anymore.
There's a lot of handwork goes into them.
And this new generation of witches just doesn't have the patience.
Where shall I put it?
How powerful is it?
Oh, not terribly, really.
It is very old, you know.
But if a human comes within three feet of it he'll just have to say what's on his mind.
Oh, splendid.
May I see it, Hagatha?
Of course.
Oh, it's a dear little thing.
Put it on the desk, Hagatha.
One more thing.
They do know what they're saying, don't they?
Oh, yes.
And Samantha won't be affected by it, will she?
Not at all.
She's still one of us, isn't she?
Oh, of course.
Of course.
Now, would you like a gift card to go with it?
Oh, yes.
Thank you, Hagatha.
If I'm not prying too much, what did you put on the card?
Oh, just, "Thought you might be interested in this.
Uncle Herbert".
An uncle of Samantha's husband, who travels around the world a lot.
I'd rather my son-in-law didn't know it was from me.
Remember, if he doesn't like it you can always exchange it for something else.
Oh, thank you, Hagatha.
I'll call him right away, Miss Thatcher.
Miss Thatcher, would you come in here for a minute?
Yes, sir?
Miss Thatcher, how did this package get on my desk?
Well, I don't know, sir.
I hadn't noticed it before.
My uncle Herbert's full of surprises.
You know, he always says That sure is a tight dress you're wearing.
Your uncle always says that?
And I second the thought.
Wow, that dress looks like it was sprayed on.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, sir.
That is a tight dress, is what that is.
I'm sorry if I'm wearing something inappropriate.
Inappropriate?
Oh, no.
Not at all, Miss Thatcher.
That's a very charming dress.
I shouldn't have been so personal.
Well, I don't mind your being personal, Mr. Stephens.
To tell you the truth, I wore this dress especially for you.
I hoped it would get to you.
It's two sizes too small.
I thought it would be nice for you to notice that I was a woman just once.
Miss Thatcher.
I was just kidding.
Really, I don't know what made me say that.
Yes.
Well that makes us even.
- I'll take that in here.
- I wish you would.
Mr. Stephens' office.
Well, just a moment, Mr. Burke.
I'll see if he's in.
Mr. Burke wants to know if you've done anything on his campaign.
I haven't done a thing.
I'd better tell him I had the chickenpox or something.
Hello, Mr. Burke.
How are you?
No, I haven't.
Not a darn thing.
Well, no, Mr. Burke, I haven't forgotten about you.
I've been snowed under with other things.
I haven't been able to work up any enthusiasm for your product.
Now, look, Mr. Burke, we have a lot more important clients than you, and The same to you, buddy.
Sorehead.
Am I mistaken, or did you throw an account out the window?
Yeah, I did, and it's about time too.
What's the matter with you?
An account's an account.
There are some that aren't worth it.
This is one of them.
What's more, you knew it when you gave it to me.
That's very unfair, Darrin.
It's the truth.
I wanted the Hotchkiss account.
I know how to sell that dishwasher of his.
And besides, a raise should go along with it.
What's bugging you this morning, Darrin?
I gave you the Burke account because it was a challenge.
And I want no part of it.
That's a miserable man, a marginal product and I have no intention of knocking myself out.
And you can stop making goo-goo eyes at the Hotchkiss account because it's mine.
All mine.
Right, Larry.
Sure.
I hope you'll be in a better mood when we come tonight with Mr. Hotchkiss and his wife.
Yeah, I'll try to be a good boy.
Well, see you tonight at 7, Darrin.
I'm looking forward to it, Larry.
Big shot.
What did you stop me for?
What is it I've done?
You know what you did, mister.
You went through a red light.
That light turned yellow just as I was going through the intersection.
It was red all the way through.
It was yellow, and you know it.
Come on, now, tell the truth.
May I see your driver's li?
Yeah, it was yellow, all right.
You admit it?
Yeah, you got me.
What did you flag me down for?
Oh, I was feeling lousy and I just felt like I had to hang one on somebody.
Always makes me feel better when I get this way.
Do you get this way often?
You would too.
I've got two enemies who are trying to destroy my natural good nature.
My sergeant by day, and my wife by night.
Yeah, you've got it rough.
Keeping people from killing one another and all you get in return is a nasty look for your trouble.
Mister, you really understand.
You know, you don't meet up with your kind very often.
Well, I don't feel this way very often.
Would you mind removing yourself from my car?
I'd like to go home.
Okay, buddy.
But don't go through that light again, or I'll throw the book at you.
Sam, I'm home.
- Fine, Darrin.
Be down in a minute.
- Okay.
Hello, David.
Did you have a nice day?
Would you mind flying down from your roost?
My, we are testy today, aren't we?
I don't know, I'm just not myself today.
Oh, you're wrong.
You're very much yourself today.
What is that supposed to mean?
Hi there.
Hi, darling.
- What kind of a kiss is that?
- A cautious kiss.
- I didn't want a roller in the eye.
- Honey, I'm sorry.
I had to do my hair for tonight.
You don't mind, do you?
Sure, I do.
All men do.
If women only realized how ridiculous and unfeminine they look.
All that hardware in their hair.
You want me to look pretty, don't you?
Well, look at it this way: How would you feel if I came down the stairs with shaving cream all over my face and offered you my forehead to kiss.
Darrin.
I wouldn't be at my most attractive, would I?
No.
And you're not right now.
I find his honesty very refreshing, Samantha.
Well, thank you, Mom.
Well, if the sight of me is so distressing, I'll go back upstairs.
Oh, Sam.
Sweetheart.
You are the one woman in the world who can get away with it.
Even if you tried, you couldn't be not beautiful.
My that's the sweetest, whitest little lie I ever heard.
All right, Mother.
That'll do.
Oh, what's that?
Oh, it's from Uncle Herbert.
It arrived at the office today.
Hey, you should've seen the dress my secretary was wearing today.
Boy!
Couldn't keep your eyes off her, I suppose.
Well, it wasn't easy.
Of course, she can't compare with Sam.
Miss Thatcher is Well, you take her out of that dress - Is everything set for dinner?
- Yes.
Oh, darling.
Don't let a thing like that bother you.
You know how men are with their secretaries.
Now, wait a minute!
Why don't you two go upstairs and get dressed?
I hope you have a lovely evening.
- Thank you, dear.
- Don't worry about me.
I'll find something to eat someplace.
- Okay, fine.
- By myself somewhere.
Maybe I won't bother.
When I'm alone, I just don't have an appetite.
Why don't you stay and have dinner with us?
Oh, darling.
That's very nice of you.
Are you sure that I won't be in the way?
No, no, of course not.
The Tates love seeing you, don't they, darling?
Oh, yes.
Yes, they really, certainly, really, really do.
Don't overdo it, dear.
- Seven o'clock, Samantha?
- Yes, 7:00.
Seven o'clock.
Well, I looked that man straight in the eye and I said, "Sir, give me a chance to prove to you that a 6-year-old boy can handle the toughest paper route in town".
He did, and I did, and that's how I got my start.
Ed, that's a wonderful, heart-warming story.
- Isn't it, Darrin?
- Certainly is, Larry.
- Fresh drink, Mr. Hotchkiss?
- Oh, thank you.
- I'll have one, Darrin.
- Stephens, that's a cute wife you got.
Maybe she could help us write slogans for my dishwasher.
I'm afraid I'm not very good at that sort of thing.
Yes, it does take a little talent, doesn't it?
That reminds me.
I thought of a great slogan for my dishwasher today.
- I'll let you have it for nothing.
- Great.
Let's hear it.
Everybody ready?
- Frances.
- You're absolutely right, Ed.
I haven't said anything yet.
What was the slogan, Mr. Hotchkiss?
Well, this is going to kill you.
Here's how it goes: "Confucius say don't be wishy-washy, buy a Hotchkiss dishy-washy".
- Hey, that's great, Ed.
- Hey.
Darrin, make a note of that, and we'll discuss it at the meeting.
Sure.
Sure, Larry.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
I won't have to make a note of that, because I won't forget it.
How could I forget anything as ridiculous as that?
What was that you said?
"Wishy-washy, dishy-washy".
You must be kidding, Ed.
Now, Darrin, you've got to admit that it's pretty catchy.
- Watch yourself, Darrin.
- Don't get nervous.
I know Hotchkiss is a pet of yours.
That's right, buddy boy.
If anybody's going to laugh at a pet client of mine it's gonna be me.
"Confucius say".
Did you ever hear of anything this ridiculous?
I've heard better slogans from a 10-year-old child.
Darrin, Larry, don't tease Mr. Hotchkiss.
They always do this with a new client.
It's a sort of fraternity initiation.
Junior high school fraternity.
You must lose a lot of clients that way.
Oh, no, we only do it to clients who have a good sense of humour.
Yeah, like you, Ed.
Yeah.
That's one thing you can say about me without fear of contradiction.
- Right, Frances?
- Whatever you say, Ed.
A sense of humour has always been an important ingredient in my success.
I've always been able to laugh at misfortune.
Even during the grim days when I was pulling myself up the ladder.
Rung by rung, I worked myself up into the appliance business until Knock it off, Ed.
What did you say, Frances?
You didn't work your way into the business.
You were kicked into it by my father who gave you $25,000 when we got married.
How can you say a thing like that?
It's very easy.
It's the truth.
- But - Darrin what'd you put in those drinks?
I don't know, but I'll give you odds we never make it to dinner.
Now, Frances, take it easy.
Give him both barrels, honey.
You'll feel better.
- Louise!
- I've been clamming up for years while he's been playing "I Love Me" on his big trombone.
And don't you ever snap your fingers at me again.
Say, why don't we all have another drink, huh?
Samantha, is dinner almost ready?
Dinner may be ready, but Frances isn't.
She has a few more things to say.
Haven't you, honey?
Plenty.
But this'll do for starters.
The odds against dinner are going up.
I'll be going up straight through the ceiling if you don't do something.
Okay, honey.
You know a little bit of frankness can be a very refreshing and healthy thing.
But a lot of frankness is a gasser.
- What's come over you?
- You interrupted me.
- Darrin!
- You never talked to me like this in your life.
- It's time somebody did.
- And it's about time you listened.
- Hold on, Darrin.
- Darrin, listen.
- You stay out of this, Sam.
- I can handle this, Larry.
- I think it's time for dinner, everyone.
You might begin by listening to your wife.
And then your advertising representatives.
Keep going.
Go on.
You're making lots of sense.
I've waited for years for you to stop being that silent, suffering martyr.
You picked a beautiful time to turn yourself on.
Silent martyr?
Now, you look here, Ed Now, just a minute, folks.
I'm not finished yet.
I think it's time for dinner, everyone.
Larry?
I think we ought to postpone this little discussion until right now.
There are ways of handling an account.
I don't think this is any of them.
Ed, we don't tell you how to make dishwashers because you make a good one.
We don't need amateurs telling us how to conduct your advertising campaign.
Well, let's go in, everyone.
We might as well fight this out over dinner.
Darrin, let him tell him off.
It's his account.
Louise, if I want your help, I'll ask for it.
You leave her alone.
She's a fine, courageous woman.
Oh, for heaven's sakes, where's your manners?
We're guests in this house.
- Oh, that's perfectly all right, really.
- This is my house too and I give Frances permission to say anything.
Go ahead, Frances.
Well, why aren't you laughing, Ed?
Where's that sense of humour that carried you through when you were climbing that ladder?
Why don't we let it wait until after dinner?
Good morning, daughter.
Good morning.
Is there anything you'd like to discuss with your dear old Mother?
Like last night's disaster, for example?
Wasn't it awful?
Well, as I said, that's what you have to expect when human beings are forced to tell the truth.
- Mother.
- Isn't that right, my little friend?
Then Darrin's uncle Herbert didn't send that.
You did.
That's right.
It's a little truth god.
Hi, sweetheart.
Is coffee ready yet?
No, I haven't put it on yet.
Well, then how come?
Darrin, before you come any closer I think you ought to know that Mother sent that.
And any human that comes near it has to say what's on his mind.
You see?
They just can't stand the truth, any of them.
That was a mean, low, sneaky, underhanded trick.
Yes, it was.
And I'm quite pleased with myself.
It was at the party last night.
Mother kept it busy.
That's what caused all the trouble.
Oh, fine, great.
Then all I have to do is tell Larry that we were all under the influence of a magic statue.
He'll understand.
Simple.
Here's your chance to explain.
He's coming up the walk right now.
- Have fun, children.
- Moth - Darling, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
Darrin, you made a fool of yourself last night.
And you darn near made one of me.
Appeared to me that everyone was doing a good job on themselves.
- Including you.
- Oh, good morning, Samantha.
- Lovely dinner.
- Lf you want some it's still out in the kitchen.
I tell you, I stayed up practically all night trying to calm down Hotchkiss and his wife.
Not to mention Louise.
Oh, I salvaged the account but I do think I'm entitled to an apology from you.
Well, Larry, I There's no reason for Darrin to make an apology.
I'm afraid you'll have to get along without one.
Maybe I can get along without him at the office too.
- Why don't you try?
- You've got a deal.
And it's the worst deal I ever made.
I need you at the office, you know that.
I can't get along without you.
Oh, that's nice to hear, isn't it, Darrin?
What about Mr. And Mrs. Hotchkiss?
Well to tell the truth, I wasn't up with them last night.
He called me this morning.
They continued the donnybrook they were having and cleared up a lot of old misunderstandings.
- They're happy as larks.
- Oh, how sweet.
Did they say anything about Darrin?
As a matter of fact, he did.
He said Darrin was right about the slogan and that we know more about advertising than he does.
He thinks Darrin's a great guy.
Well, that's fine, Larry.
- You'll be down at the office later?
- Of course I will, Larry.
I'll be there as soon as I get a raise and full responsibility for the Hotchkiss account.
What?
You drive a hard bargain, Darrin.
But okay.
See you at the office.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Where's the statue?
Right here, Mother.
And you were wrong.
Nothing but good seems to have come from the truth.
Well, you can't win them all.
Anything you'd like to say, dear?
Darling, you're beautiful, sweet, charming, adorable and I love you madly.
There, you hear that?
And that's the truth.
But your mother is an irritating, meddling - Darrin.
- I'm not finished yet.
- I'm going to say a lot more.
- Oh, no, you're not.
As I was saying your mother is an irritating, meddling, nasty Well, I guess I told her.
Guess you did.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Darrin?
- I'm right here, sweetheart.
- Oh, hi there.
I'll be dressed in a minute.
We're due at the orphanage in half an hour.
- Did you get the tree?
- Oh, yes.
I got it.
- How much was it?
- Eighteen dollars.
And they wanted 5 dollars extra, delivery charge.
Must be pretty big.
It was pretty big all right, but I got it home.
Good, honey.
I'll be down in a few minutes to take it out of the car.
Oh, no.
No, Darrin, don't bother.
I can manage.
Five dollars delivery charge.
Good.
Tree in the car?
No.
No, darling.
It's right over there.
- Isn't it lovely?
- Well, it certainly is.
Sam, did you carry in that huge tree by yourself?
No.
No, not that huge tree.
What does that mean?
Well, Darrin, you've heard the expression: "Large oaks from little acorns grow".
Sam, you didn't.
Oh, darling, it's Christmas.
No time to squabble over a little thing like making a tree.
Well, it is pretty.
Although, after last year it doesn't seem like Christmas without having a kid around the house.
Oh, well, just wait a little while.
What's that?
Oh, that is a Christmas card from Michael.
From Michael?
"Thank you for showing me what Christmas is all about.
Merry Christmas.
Love, Michael".
Isn't that sweet?
He certainly is a changed boy from last year.
Oh, yes.
Remember when we first saw him at the orphanage?
Who could forget?
Hurry up, Abner.
What's the rush, Gladys?
The kid isn't running away.
- Hello, Tommy.
- Hello.
What would you like Santa Claus to bring you for Christmas?
- I don't need anything.
- Sounds like a nice boy.
Tommy, you're gonna come home and spend Christmas with us.
Would you like that?
That's wonderful.
Now, you stay right here, and we'll tell Mrs. Grange that we're ready to leave.
Do you suppose Santa is coming to your house on Christmas?
He'll be there.
The 15th of every month after that.
What do you want, Michael?
You let my Santa Claus alone.
- You still believe in that kids' stuff?
- It's not kids' stuff.
Oh, yeah?
What's Santa Claus gonna bring you?
- Lots of things, that's what.
- I bet you get nothing.
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah, I wanna bet.
I think that's everything.
You just sign this one, but Oh, dear!
Boys!
Tommy, Michael!
Stop this at once.
Stop it, I say.
Now get up, boys.
Tommy, Michael, I'm ashamed of both of you.
Well, he said Christmas was a lot of bunk.
Oh, you're gonna have a black eye.
Come on, Tommy, we'll get you a steak for that.
Now, what's the matter with cold cuts?
Michael, some very nice people have come to take you home for the holidays.
This is Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
- Hello, Michael.
- Hi.
Hello.
Oh, my.
- Here.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Perhaps we better complete the arrangements.
Yes, why don't you.
Darrin, Michael and I will wait for you here.
- Fine.
- Would you come to my desk?
All right.
See you later.
Well, what was the fight all about?
I didn't start it.
Self-defence, huh?
I won't tell anybody.
Well, just because I busted his little old Santa Claus he punched me in the nose.
Why did you do that?
You must have had a reason.
- He called me a liar.
- Well, that wasn't very nice.
It sure wasn't.
Were you?
Lying, I mean?
Of course not.
Christmas is a lot of bunk and so is Santa Claus.
You don't really believe that?
Sure I do.
Don't you?
- Not me, I know better.
- Baloney.
You better be careful or you're apt to get another punch in the nose.
Now that they've had a chance to talk, he's coming to warn you.
He's gonna say, " Don't waste your time with Michael because he's a problem child".
- Are you?
Honey, may I speak to you for a minute?
Mrs. Grange tells me that Michael's been a problem around here.
He's a troubled child if you know what I mean.
- Yes, I can see that.
- No, it's serious, Sam.
A couple adopted him.
Twice they had to bring him back.
Mrs. Grange is of the opinion that he's not a child who would enjoy or appreciate spending Christmas with us.
I'm sure that Mrs. Grange means well.
But I think that Michael is exactly the sort of child that has to spend Christmas away from here with people like us.
- Well, Sam - Please, Darrin.
Okay.
I just hope he knows the meaning of: "Peace on Earth, goodwill towards men".
How'd you make out?
I can't reach him.
Christmas doesn't mean a thing to him.
He is the youngest Scrooge I've ever seen.
Maybe when he sees Santa Claus it'll touch off a spark somewhere.
- I don't know.
- Oh, let's not give up yet.
Whatever it is that disillusioned him, we can't make it up to him in 5 minutes.
Okay.
You take over.
I'll go practice my, "Ho, ho, ho".
"And because of his tiny stature they called him Tom Thumb.
They let him want for nothing, yet the child grew no bigger but remained the same size as when he was born".
"Still he looked out on the world with intelligent eyes and soon showed himself a clever and agile" Oh, I'm sorry, Michael.
I didn't know you were asleep.
That's okay.
Maybe we better stop now, huh?
- What was that?
- What?
Did you hear a noise on the roof?
That's funny, I could've sworn There it is again.
It's coming from downstairs now.
Didn't you hear it?
Yeah, just then I did.
It's probably Mr. Stephens.
Mr. Stephens had to go to the village.
He won't be back for a while.
Michael, there's someone downstairs.
- Yeah?
Who?
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- Would you mind coming with me?
- Okay.
- Put your slippers on.
- Okay.
Be very, very quiet.
Michael, look.
Well, what do you think of Santa Claus now?
Well, by my beard, I've been caught.
Here I thought me and my reindeer were as quiet as mice.
Well, no matter.
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Stephens.
Merry Christmas, Michael.
Same to you, Mr. Stephens.
Who?
Well, what do you mean?
I'm Santa Claus.
Don't you know me?
Where are you going?
Don't you wanna see what Santa brought you, son?
I don't care what you've brought me, and I'm not your son.
Well, that about does it.
Don't be angry, sweetheart.
I've got as much Christmas spirit as the next fellow.
But there's a limit to what even Santa Claus can take.
- I'm going to talk to him.
- I wanna wish you good luck.
I'll need it.
Michael.
Michael, I thought we were going to be friends.
You don't have to treat me like a kid.
- What do you mean?
- I told you, there ain't no Santa Claus.
- Why do you say that?
- Because I know.
How do you know?
Santa Claus is a kid's father stuffed with pillows like Mr. Stephens, like in a department store like my father used to be.
And all the kids used to ask him for things.
He used to tell me money didn't grow on trees and how there aren't any real Santa Clauses.
They were all kids' fathers stuffed with pillows.
Michael, suppose I were to tell you that it really isn't exactly that way.
Suppose I were to tell you that there really is a Santa Claus.
And I know because I've talked to him.
Suppose I were to tell you that.
What would you say?
I'd say, "Prove it".
- I can.
- How?
- I can take you to the North Pole to see.
- The North Pole?
Like that, practically.
No one can do that.
A witch can.
So I can.
Because I am a witch.
I don't believe you.
I suppose you want me to prove it.
Well, all right.
You ready?
How's that?
Where's your pointed hat?
Pointed hat?
Okay.
That's pretty good.
But where's your broom?
Broom, huh?
- Can you ride it?
- Of course.
- With me too?
- Lf you like.
Michael, how would you like to take that little trip right now?
- You mean now?
- Now.
Here, you better put this on.
It's apt to be a little chilly.
And don't forget your feet.
- Now, you can - What's going on?
Excuse me, Michael.
- What are you doing?
- Darling Christmas Eve is almost over and we haven't gotten anywhere with him.
I can't take him back tomorrow as unhappy and disillusioned as he was when he came.
- What are you gonna do?
- Take him to see Santa Claus.
- Another one?
- The real one.
The real?
Are you telling?
Are you trying to tell me there really is a?
- Of course there is, darling.
- Where?
I mean, where?
Where?
- Where does?
- Where does he live?
Yeah.
The North Pole.
Oh, come on, Sam.
Well, it's true.
- Why don't you come with us?
- You're kidding.
No, I'm serious.
Me?
Go to the North Pole to see Santa Claus?
Why not?
It's Christmas.
All right.
By the time Santa gets here this tree'll be loaded.
Are you sure he's gonna come?
- I told you, he'll be here.
- Oh, sure.
Now, I'm gonna do the dishes.
By the time I'm finished it'll be time to go to bed.
Okay, Tommy?
Abner!
Abner, look!
- Look where?
- In the sky.
Three of them.
Two big ones and a little one.
Did you see them, Abner?
- Oh, sure I did.
- Did you?
Did you really?
- I sure did.
- Did you see all three of them?
Certainly.
There was Donder, Blitzen and Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
- What are you talking about, Abner?
- I saw them as plain as day.
- I didn't see no Donder and Blitzen.
- So it was Dancer and Prancer.
What's the difference?
They're probably looking for the house now.
Why don't we sing so they can fly in on the beam?
Sing, Gladys, sing.
Sleigh, Gladys.
Sleigh.
Here we are.
- Where?
Where?
- The North Pole.
- Really?
- Certainly.
And that's where Santa lives.
Who's out there?
Excuse me, but is Mr. Claus very busy?
Of course he's very busy.
What do you think this is?
The Fourth of July?
We won't keep him long.
Will you just tell him Samantha's here?
- Samantha who?
- Just tell him Samantha.
He'll know.
All right, but I'm not promising anything.
Do you suppose he'll see us?
Oh, I'm sure of it.
Have you known him long?
Oh, yes.
A long time.
He'll be right out.
Make yourselves at home.
Samantha.
Samantha, what a pleasant surprise.
How are you, my dear?
- Just fine, Santa, and you?
- Oh, just the same.
Always the same.
Oh, excuse me.
Santa, this is my husband, Darrin.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Santa?
- And this is Michael.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Michael.
Won't you sit down?
Come on, Michael.
Sit over here.
I'm sorry I haven't much time to chat with you.
I can at least offer you a cup of tea or a glass of milk.
- Michael?
- No, thank you, Santa.
- Dennis?
- Darrin, Santa.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
- No, thank you.
Nothing for me, Santa.
Well, it It must be something very important that brought you all the way here.
What's the problem?
I think the problem's been solved by just being here.
Those aren't pillows, are they?
No, my boy.
Sometimes I wish they were.
I've tried all kinds of diet, but nothing works.
But then again, if I got too thin, my children might not recognize me.
I'd know you.
Yes, l I think you would.
But what difference does it make how we look on the outside, eh?
It's what we feel on the inside that counts, isn't it?
We all grow older and our eyes get weaker but what we've seen with our hearts remains forever a thing of joy and beauty.
Do you agree with that, sir?
- Yes, I do, Santa.
- Good.
Now, I must be going.
I've talked long enough.
But before I go, I want you to tell me what you'd like for Christmas.
I don't know.
I guess I haven't thought much about it.
Well, then, take your time.
Just take a little look around the display tables.
Pick out something nice for yourself.
Or maybe for someone else.
Remember, Michael the real happiness of Christmas isn't found in what we get but what we give.
Darrin.
- Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up.
- What?
Michael's asleep.
I think you better take him upstairs to bed.
You know, I had the strangest dream.
He was in it and so were you.
We all went to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.
How about that?
- Sounds like fun.
- It was.
Honey, turn the heat up, will you?
Feels like snow.
I'm not gonna start nothing, Tommy.
- What'd you come over here for?
- I got a present for you.
I didn't get nothing for you, Michael.
That's okay.
Why don't you try it.
Gee, Michael, it's keen.
Where'd you get it?
Promise not to tell?
Cross your heart?
Last night we went to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.
- Mr. And Mrs. Stephens and me.
- You did?
- How?
- Mrs. Stephens' broom.
- Abner!
- What's the matter, Gladys?
- I want you to come with me.
- For what?
The little boy from the Stephens' house is here.
He's talking with Tommy.
So?
Well, I just want you to hear what they're saying.
Come on.
- Where did he go?
- Michael?
He had to go home.
Well, now would you tell Mr. Kravitz what he said about where he went last night?
- Where?
- You know with Mr. And Mrs. Stephens on her broom.
He didn't say anything like that, Mrs. Kravitz.
But I heard you talking.
I was at the window and I heard you talking about going to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.
Wait a minute, Abner.
Tommy, please tell Mr. Kravitz about the North Pole.
- Gladys.
- Wait a minute, Abner.
Abner.
Abner, wait now.
Please try to remember, Tommy.
Tommy, try to remember.
I know.
Abner, wait.
The broom.
The broom.
The broom, Tommy.
He didn't say anything like that, Mrs. Kravitz.
Gee, Mrs. Kravitz when a fella crosses his heart what can a fella do?
Take off.
- Turn.
- Watch, watch, watch.
Oh, never mind.
I'll get it.
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Stephens.
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Grange.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you so much.
May I present Mr. And Mrs. Johnson.
This is the couple who's been interested in Michael.
- I see.
How do you do?
- Hello.
How do you do?
We have a gift for Michael.
We hoped you wouldn't mind.
Of course not.
Let's all go in the living room.
- Hello, Mrs. Grange.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Stephens.
Merry Christmas, Michael.
This is my husband.
This is Mr. And Mrs. Johnson.
- Hello.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- And Merry Christmas to you, Michael.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
I've got a present for you too.
I hope you'll like it.
I brought it all the way from From town.
It's a toolbox.
It's got a hammer and a saw and a drill.
I bet if we could find wood, we could build a whole lot of great things.
Would you really like to try it?
I must've caught a cold somewhere last night.
- Well, come on.
Let's open it.
- You think we can open it right now?
Goodbye, Michael.
Thank you for spending Christmas with us.
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
Goodbye, Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye, Michael.
You come back and visit us, huh?
We'll certainly see to that, Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
What was that?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
If we don't come up with something on the Kingsley potato chip account I have to bring Larry home to work tonight.
- That's all right.
- Two weeks.
Twelve hours a day, and nothing.
- Where's my case?
- Here.
I don't understand it.
I've never hit a dry spell like this before.
- Well, you'll think of something.
- I sure hope so.
Well, better put a lot of coffee on just in case.
Haven't you forgotten something?
Good.
"A crunchy, tasty, crackling, good experience fit for the crown heads of Europe".
What do you think, Larry?
Who cares about the crown heads of Europe?
We're selling a product as American as apple pie.
"Kingsley's potato chips, as American as apple pie".
I got it.
"Kingsley's potato chips may be new and improved but they're still a chip off the old block".
This from the man who gave the world the Caldwell soup slogan.
Pathetic.
Larry, I've got it!
I've got it.
Listen.
"Other potato chips may be like chips that pass in the night but Kingsley's potato chips make you feel like your chip just came in".
How can you say something like that with such enthusiasm?
I always get enthusiastic when I'm desperate.
I've noticed.
Whenever you leap to your feet and yell I know it's going to be a bomb.
Look, why don't we knock off and try again tonight at your house?
"Knock off a bag of Kingsley's potato chips tonight at your house".
How about that?
- Yeah, how about that.
- I don't get it, Larr.
My mind just isn't functioning properly.
Relax, Darrin, you're trying too hard.
You're all tensed up.
You're right, Larry.
Even my brain feels clenched.
All you need is a few hours' rest and I'm sure that by tonight you'll be brimming over with great ideas.
Kings Tonight.
That idea of yours about the costumes and crowns, that wasn't too bad.
What was it?
I'm so punchy, I can't remember.
The royal court, playing on the word "king".
- Kingsley potato chips.
"King".
- Any luck?
- Nothing.
- Can't you remember what you said?
I'm sorry, Larry.
My brain just isn't working.
Oh, Larry, he's tired.
If only he could get away for a little while, take some time off.
Maybe that would help.
And I think I have just the place.
I own a little cabin in the woods, a kind of a Catskill retreat.
- Sounds wonderful.
Black?
- With sugar.
It's quiet, it's empty, it's yours.
Darrin can take tomorrow off, and you can spend three days right in the most beautiful scenery that ever took your breath away.
What's the place like, Larry?
Well, it's kind of rustic.
Thanks, Sam.
I haven't had a chance to get up there in, let's see, three years.
As a matter of fact, it's up for sale now.
- Is it really quiet?
- There isn't even a phone.
What do you say?
No, Larry.
I can't goof off in the middle of an assignment.
You're no good to me like this.
Miserable, sleepy, grumpy.
- I get enough of that at home.
- Put it out of your mind, Larry.
There's nothing you can do or say that'll make me go.
- You're fired.
- I'll go.
Well, it's quite something, isn't it?
It certainly is.
Rustic, dignified.
Did you ever see anything with so much charm?
And such downright character.
Well maybe it's better inside.
Oh, my stars.
Honey, watch where you step.
You better stay there.
Well, here we are, "hovel sweet hovel".
How could Larry do this to us?
So I didn't come up with an idea.
Is that any reason to send us into penal servitude?
Darrin.
- Darrin, l - No.
- Oh, well, Darrin - No, Sam.
No magic.
Look, we can't use your witchcraft every time we get into trouble.
There's something unnatural about it.
You understand, don't you?
Oh, boy.
That's all we need.
Sweetheart, may I make an un-magical suggestion?
- Please do.
- Let's go home.
Okay.
Wait a minute.
We better check on what the roads are like around here when it rains.
Remember, Larry said no telephone.
Honey, we'll just have to chance it.
Well, I'm game.
I mean, even if the roads are slippery and muddy they can't hold us up too long.
The chances of getting hit by lightening are, well, extremely slim.
And I suppose if the bridges are washed out, it really won't Okay.
All right.
Okay, okay.
Make me the phone.
Thank you.
Operator, I'd like a road report, please.
Can you connect me?
Sam.
What was that?
That was bad news.
It seems like the roads around here wash out when there's a sun shower.
Honey, I don't want to chance it, not in your condition.
Are you cold?
Well, a fire would be nice.
Well Sam does it make you feel guilty to know at this moment the Boy Scouts of America are trying to do that trick with sticks and stones?
Oh, so that's how they do it.
My, isn't that beautiful?
It's the perfect time for a little redecorating.
Time for what?
Take that silly old chair.
There.
That's better.
- Sam.
- You're right, sweetheart.
- I shouldn't be doing it this way.
- You certainly shouldn't.
- I should just do it all at once.
- That's not what I meant.
Now, Darrin, you're tired and overworked.
And you really need this little vacation.
You don't want to spend it in a dreary, dilapidated old shack, do you?
Honey, I don't care about me, I'm worried about you.
Okay.
You talked me into it.
Well I guess a mother-to-be deserves some privileges.
How about a father-to-be?
It's pretty hard to put anything over on you, isn't it?
Then how come you do it so often?
Mr. Tate?
- Yes?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
- We're Mr. And Mrs. MacBain.
- We've come in reply to your ad.
- Ad?
- Concerning your cottage.
- Oh, that ad.
I almost forgot.
It's been listed so long.
We just got married, and we need a place in the country.
- Don't we, Charles?
- We sure do, honey.
We're gonna be up that way tomorrow.
Is it all right if we have a look at it?
Of course.
At the moment, some friends of mine are staying there.
I'm sure they wouldn't mind showing you through.
We'd appreciate it, Mr. Tate.
From your description, it sounds like what we're looking for.
Well, to be honest with you, it might need a little work.
You don't have to sell us on it, Mr. Tate.
For the money you're asking, we don't expect Buckingham Palace.
Well, it has great potential.
I'm sure anyone with talent could work wonders with it.
What a beautiful morning.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
Sam!
There's no lock on the door.
I wonder if it's all right to leave it open while we're gone.
- Would you like me to?
Never mind.
Okay.
I guess I've used up my quota of witchcraft for the weekend.
For the weekend?
For the whole year.
Well, Mr. Tate was right.
It's no Buckingham Palace.
Who wants Buckingham Palace?
I adore it.
- So do I. - Come on.
- They don't seem to be home.
- Try the door.
Oh, Charles.
It's beautiful!
It's just what we've been dreaming about.
You wouldn't believe it from the outside.
Oh, look at these curtains.
Nice bar.
- Oh, and the fireplace.
- Neat bar.
Have you ever seen such exquisite furniture?
Would you like a drink?
You get on that phone to Mr. Tate, Charles, this minute.
You're calling from the cabin?
You will?
At the listed price?
Don't you even want to quibble about it?
He wants $1000 down, honey.
I think $1000 down would be fine, Mr. Tate.
Then it's a deal.
I'll have the papers drawn up.
- Thank you, Mr. Tate.
- My pleasure.
Oh, you must be Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
- Welcome to our new home.
- New - What?
- Home.
We just bought it, lock, stock and barrel.
Bought?
Lock, stock and barrel?
That's what I said.
- Didn't I, Charles?
- You sure did, honey.
Sam, we can't let them.
You don't have to whisper.
They're outside, looking at the grounds.
Sam, we've gotta get out of this.
- Got to?
- Got to.
We can't allow that young couple to spend their savings on this - This dump.
- Why?
We'll leave it just as it is.
Honey, that's dishonest.
This isn't Larry's cabin.
This is witchcraft.
- But they'd enjoy it so much.
- Honey, turn it back.
- Well - Sam, turn it back and let's get out of here.
Okay.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens?
Yes?
- It's too divine to be true.
- Yes, isn't it?
Charles thinks he's died and gone to heaven.
Well, that's one way out.
Don't you think you're being just a trifle hasty?
I mean, things aren't always what they seem.
- There are certain drawbacks.
- Such as?
Well, the The cross ventilation.
It's broken.
Mrs. Stephens, have you ever had a sinus condition?
- Why, no.
L - Well, Charles has.
The doctor says it won't get better unless Charles can be where he can get plenty of fresh air.
Must it be this air?
Well, the night Charles' doctor said that, I had a dream.
A little cottage in the country.
It was so beautiful, it It was so real that Well, that when I woke up, I said to Charles: "Charles, that's the one I want".
Ever since then, we've been looking.
For months and months.
We've seen hundreds of places.
But not until we saw this one here did Did I see anything that remotely resembled the cottage of my dream.
- Come on, Charles.
- Where are you going?
- Back to the city.
- You changed your mind?
We're going to pack.
As soon as you're ready to leave, we're moving in.
Darrin, I can't do it.
Honey, this house is built by witchcraft.
It's the only one of its kind.
Now, you don't want poor Charles searching forever with his sinuses.
Why don't we just leave it the way it is.
What possible harm could it do?
Every time you say that, I feel like taking out accident insurance.
Okay, I'll call Fred Hinkle in the morning.
- Who's Fred Hinkle?
- My insurance agent.
For Mr. And Mrs. Charles MacBain The young couple that were here yesterday?
Yes.
They telephoned from the cabin this afternoon.
Strange they went for that price so quickly.
I asked for a couple of thousand more than I expected to get.
Oh, don't write that, Ms. Thatcher.
Write this: Please draw up the said contract as quickly as possible.
Yours very truly, et cetera, et cetera.
Type that up, and you can go, Ms. Thatcher.
Thank you.
There's no phone in that cabin.
- Is that everything?
- I think so.
What is it?
- Isn't that Larry's car?
- It sure is.
We can't let him see the cabin when it's not looking a mess.
Turn it back.
I can't believe it.
How could this place deteriorate so much in three years?
Well, it has a lot of potential.
I can't believe you spent the night here.
Oh, it wasn't so bad.
Sam fixed it up a little.
- Fixed it up?
- Yeah, it looked pretty bad before.
A mess.
But can you imagine what it would look like with a few authentic Early-American pieces?
Sure.
It'd be the best-furnished dilapidated shack in the country.
Why would the MacBains want this place?
Maybe they're con artists.
Do you suppose there's oil on this property?
- Darrin.
- What, honey?
I'll be right back.
Hi there.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Well, you see, it's still there.
- Still there?
When we got home last night, I had to keep convincing myself it was real and not just some magical dream.
Alice still believes in fairy tales with happy endings.
- I'll do my best.
- I beg your pardon?
Nothing.
I'm afraid you're a little early.
That's okay.
We'll just sit in the living room and drink up the atmosphere.
- I'll get it.
I still can't believe it.
Well, welcome, landowners.
- Such as it is.
- Mr. Tate.
I hope you haven't changed your mind.
Well, no.
- Haven't you?
- Why should we?
It's just as beautiful as ever.
- Beautiful?
- I'm just crazy about Early American.
You sure have a good eye for decorating, Mr. Tate.
I do?
There's such an air of, well, enchantment about this place.
I can't explain it.
Don't try.
Please, don't try.
Enchantment?
This pile of rubble?
To you, Mr. Tate, a man in your position this may certainly seem like a pile of rubble.
But to Charles and me, it's Well, it is Buckingham Palace.
And to think, it's all ours for only $5000.
Five thousand dollars?
Oh, Larry, I'm surprised at you.
Just look at this place.
- Sam!
- It wasn't easy raising the money.
But here's our check for the down payment, $1000.
Five thousand dollars.
Well, we realize it's worth a lot more.
Do you, Larry?
You're right, Samantha.
I can't let you have it.
- Well, why?
- It's a question of sleeping.
But the bed looks extremely comfortable.
It's not your sleep I'm worried about, it's mine.
I don't understand.
We want this place.
All right.
But at my price.
And that is?
- This.
- The down payment?
Paid in full.
- A thousand dollars?
- You son of a gun.
- I hope those kids will be happy.
- They looked happy to me.
You did a wonderful thing for them, Larry.
Well, I suppose beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
You know, you're going to think I'm crazy.
But there was a time when that terrible old cabin looked beautiful to me too.
I can't get over the look on that young couple's faces.
You know, there are times when being a witch can be very satisfying.
Well, don't get carried away.
I meant it when I said no more spells.
- I promise.
- Under any circumstances?
- Well - Sam!
- Under any circumstances.
- Good.
You know, it's just a matter of willpower, self-control and - What's the matter?
- I don't know.
I can't understand it.
I had the car checked just before we left.
Does that little needle pointing to "E" mean anything?
Yes, it means I forgot to get gas.
The last station's about six miles back.
- That's a long walk.
- It certainly is.
- It really is raining out there.
- Pouring.
- Sam.
- What?
Sam, would you, you know?
- Darrin!
You said - I know what I said!
But this is This is an emergency.
Under no circumstances, you said.
Sam, this is no time to split hairs.
- Oh, is that what I was doing?
- Yes.
Honey, couldn't you make this one exception?
- I promised no more spells.
- Sam.
Would half a spell do?
Half a spell?
Now try it.
Half a tank of gas.
Now, what were you saying about self-control?
Well, nobody's perfect.
Not even me.
As I was saying, there are times when being a witch can be very satisfying.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Mother.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Now, just what do you think you're doing?
It's called vacuuming the draperies.
Excuse me.
Honey, I don't want you bending and stretching like that.
Not in your condition.
Well, I appreciate your concern, but I'm fine.
And I want to keep it that way.
I don't want you to lift a finger till the baby comes.
- But Darrin - I don't mind you doing a little housework as long as you don't tax your strength.
But no bending and stretching.
You sit right down there.
I'm gonna bring you a glass of milk.
Samantha.
Turn it off.
That settles it.
- We'll hire a maid.
- What?
Louise and Larry have a maid.
Esmeralda.
She's a jewel.
I appreciate the offer, but I don't want a maid.
- Why not?
- Because I don't want a total stranger running my household.
She won't run it, honey.
She'll just help you run it.
After the baby comes, we'll have a built-in babysitter.
I'll call the agency and they'll send some girls for you to interview.
- Darrin, I don't - Sam.
I'm concerned about the health and comfort of my wife and child.
You really mean that, don't you?
Yeah.
All right.
All right, bring on the girls.
I'll interview them.
If I find one that doesn't frighten me, I'll hire her.
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.
I hope.
- Mrs. Darrin Stephens?
- Yes.
I'm from the employment agency.
My name is Mrs. Luftwaffe.
Mrs. Luftwaffe?
It's European.
Shall we be seated?
Yes.
My terms are as follows: I do no cooking, washing, ironing or heavy cleaning.
I arise at 9 a.m. I have Saturday and Sunday off.
I leave at noon on Friday and return at noon on Monday.
My room must have a colour television set.
And I reserve the right to choose my own wallpaper.
I see.
Now, about references Yes.
I'll look at them now.
You want to see my references?
From former housekeepers.
Well, I'm afraid there haven't been any.
That's bad.
I have a rule against working for beginners.
- Well, in that case, I won't take - However if I decide you have possibilities, I might make an exception.
How do you decide if I have possibilities?
I inspect how neat you keep your kitchen.
Well, I don't think that'll be necessary.
I'm sure I don't come up to your standards.
I'll be the judge of that.
Now, where is it?
- What?
- The kitchen.
Follow me.
Right that way.
Hi there.
I'm the maid from the employment agency.
- You are?
- Yeah.
I always get that reaction at first.
I mean, just because a girl's a maid is no reason not to make the most of her appearance.
- Right?
- I guess not.
- And you certainly have.
- Oh, thanks.
Hey, this is a groovy-looking house.
Yeah, real groovy.
It has a fun feeling about it, you know.
- What does your husband do?
- He's in advertising.
Groovy.
Maybe he could cast me in a coast-to-coast commercial.
I'm very photogenic.
Here are references from the last five husbands I worked for.
Don't references generally come from the wives?
Not in my case.
Somehow I always seem to establish better rapport with the husbands.
- Isn't that funny?
- Hysterical.
- Is your husband a good dancer?
- Groovy.
- Would you like to see a picture?
- I'd adore it.
This is my Darrin.
Sweetie, it's nothing personal, but I do have other people to see.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I'm Naomi Hogan.
I'm a refined widow, and if the job is still open, I'll take it.
I have my own uniforms.
I love children, and I need the money.
How do you like me so far?
So far, I like you just fine.
But I bet you'd like to know more about me.
Yes, I would.
Shall we be seated?
Well, I was born in Cincinnati the eldest daughter of a poor but honest freelance upholsterer.
- Mrs. Hogan - Oh, call me Naomi.
All right.
Naomi.
I wanted to know more about your experience as a housekeeper.
Yes.
I was afraid you would.
Why?
Because lately my experience has been lousy.
Due to a clash of personalities I have lost five jobs in the past four weeks.
Clash of personalities over what?
My general incompetence my inedible cooking and my nervous habit of breaking whatever I touch.
Well, you have one obvious virtue.
- What's that?
- You're honest.
Oh, I'm also desperate.
See, I'm sending my son through medical school and if I don't get a job I won't be able to meet the deadline on next semester's tuition.
I'll clean, I'll scrub, I'll slave and I'll also sign a note at 10-percent interest for everything I break.
- Naomi.
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're hired.
- You're kidding.
So the drunk says to the gorilla, "Lady, don't brush me off just because you're wearing a mink coat".
Why aren't you laughing, Louise?
Dear, I've heard that joke at least 50 times.
And what's your excuse, Sam?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Larry.
She was busy worrying about our new maid.
And I don't blame her.
We really should've postponed this till next week.
You don't have company the night you have a new maid.
- You give her time to get adjusted.
- Ridiculous.
If she came from the same agency that sent Esmeralda she's a seasoned veteran.
Samantha, why not go out and see how she's doing.
I know you're dying to.
Yes, I think I will.
Excuse me.
How you doing?
Oh, dear, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
It was my fault.
I startled you.
Well, back to the old lettuce bin.
Have you followed my recipe for Parisian consommé?
I tried to, but consommé isn't exactly my long suit.
I see what you mean.
- Have you tasted it yet?
- No.
Not yet.
Maybe I'd better.
In your condition, it might not be safe.
No.
It just needs a little stirring.
See?
That's terrific.
Thank you.
- I mean, congratulations.
- How about that.
I made Parisian consommé.
Let's see how well you did with the roast.
Is it too well-done?
No.
No, not really.
You're just saying that to be nice.
It looks like a king-size prune.
It just needs a little basting.
What a baste.
Mrs. Stephens, that's the best roast I ever executed.
Well, it looks like dinner is all ready.
I'll seat the guests and you serve the consommé.
Yes, ma'am.
And, Naomi, keep up the good work.
Yes, ma'am.
Superb.
I may not know anything about cooking, but I know about eating.
And this entire meal was magnificent.
- Amen.
- Thank you.
You mean, thank Naomi.
Yes, thank Naomi.
- Morning, Naomi.
- Good morning.
Why are you here on your day off?
I'm waiting for you to approve my estimate on what I cost you in breakage.
Five, 7, 9, 13, 19, 25, 8, 12, 21, 27.
Fourteen dollars and 75 cents.
I figure 5 bucks for cups and saucers $4 for ashtrays, Naomi, we're insured.
And even if we weren't, your son needs that money more than we do.
Mrs. Stephens, you're the kindest lady I ever worked for.
- And the best homemaker.
- Really?
I can't explain it, but with you around to give me handy hints I can do things that I could never do before.
- Want me to fix breakfast?
- No.
No, you run along and have a nice day.
- Know what working for you is like?
- What?
It's like all of a sudden, I found my good fairy.
- Good morning, Naomi.
- Good morning.
- Today's your day off.
- Yes.
- I'm leaving as soon as I get my purse.
- Well, have a good day.
- Hello.
- Darrin, Louise.
In trouble.
Esmeralda was called out of town because of illness in her family and tonight I'm having a formal dinner party for eight people including that big-shot new client, What's-His-Name.
Right.
H.J. Simpson.
Well, we know it's an imposition, but Larry and I wondered would you mind lending us Naomi for this evening?
To cook that same wonderful meal we had with you.
We'd be happy to pay her $15.
- Just a second.
Naomi.
- Yes, sir.
Would you like to earn an extra $15?
Oh, I'd love to.
My son, the medical student has to get a new pair of white shoes.
Mrs. Tate needs help with a party.
What time do you want her there?
- Oh, about 5:00.
- Okay.
Five o'clock.
- That's the address.
- Thanks a million.
I'll go get a uniform.
It's all set, Louise.
We're not putting you out, are we?
We really appreciate it.
Don't mention it.
It's Naomi's day off, so it won't make any difference to Samantha.
That's okay.
Have a nice party.
- Do you still remember how to cook?
- I hope so.
So do I. Naomi sets a very high standard.
I may be very hard to please.
- Who called?
- Louise Tate.
- About what?
- Oh, Esmeralda had to leave town so she hired Naomi to pinch-hit on a formal dinner party for eight.
May I have my coffee, please, honey?
Naomi!
Naomi!
Naomi?
She's gone!
- What's the matter?
- Louise has to cancel that party.
- She can't.
- Why?
- It's in honour of a client.
- Then she has to invite us.
- Why?
- Because if I'm not there to give Naomi some handy hints the evening is going to be a fiasco.
Sam, will you please tell me what you're talking about?
- Do I have to?
- Yes.
Well, it's a long story.
And I have a feeling you're gonna hate every word of it.
Looks great, Darrin.
Thank you, Larry.
Larry, I've got a great idea.
Why don't you and Louise and Samantha and I have dinner tonight.
Sam must've told you Louise borrowed Naomi.
- We're having guests for dinner.
- Oh, that's a pity.
I was looking forward to seeing both of you.
- Why?
- Just felt like it.
Well, maybe we'll go for a drive.
Darrin, I'm kind of busy.
Maybe we'll drive through your neighbourhood and drop in.
- What for?
- A bite to eat?
Darrin, I've already told you.
We're having dinner guests.
Larry, it's just as easy to cook for 10 people as it is for eight.
I don't get it.
Why are you hinting around to be invited to dinner?
Well, we're very fond of Louise, and we don't see enough of her.
You saw her Friday night.
Yes, and she was so charming, we'd like to see her again.
Okay.
Why don't you come over to dinner a week from Sunday.
We're busy.
Why don't we come tonight.
Darrin, tonight is business.
I'm wining and dining old man Simpson and his son, old man Simpson Jr. I know, and maybe he'd like to meet some other members of your staff.
The only member of my staff he's interested in is the man assigned to his account, Bob Chetley.
Why don't Bob and I change accounts?
I'll take the Simpson account, and he can take - I finally understand.
- You finally understand what?
- You're jealous of Chetley.
- I'm not Because I gave the Simpson account to him.
- Larry, that's not true.
- I think it is.
Look, may we come to dinner or not?
You know, with a little work you could overcome this terrible shyness of yours.
- Yes or no?
- No.
Don't beat around the bush.
Give me an answer.
Get out of here, Darrin.
Honey, I'll bet you a thousand dollars this doesn't work.
Darrin, don't be pessimistic.
You never know if something doesn't work until you try it.
All right.
Well, good evening.
Welcome to - I don't believe it.
- Good evening, Larry.
Here's the book I borrowed last Christmas.
Thank you.
Do you always get this dressed up to return books?
- No - Not always.
Just occasionally.
As an expectant mother, I felt a craving for a formal dinner party.
Samantha, I admire you.
You do?
I like a wife interested in her husband's career but don't push him too fast.
Darrin will be vice president when the time comes and not a moment before.
Good night.
Well.
- Come on.
- Where are we going?
Home.
If Larry thinks we're bucking for a vice-presidency we're gonna stop trying to help him and let him drown in his own fiasco.
What time is it?
Eight o'clock.
The Tate's kitchen must be a disaster area by now.
Good.
- How's your pizza?
- Fine.
- How's yours?
- Delicious.
The sweet pizza of revenge.
I I forgot the napkins.
- Naomi.
- Yes.
If I didn't know how well things turn out this mess would make me very nervous.
Well, I'm not used to flying solo.
Somehow I feel much more confident when Mrs. Stephens is around.
Isn't this Parisian consommé a little thick?
No.
You just have to stir it.
When Mrs. Stephens stirred it, it There.
Very good.
- What took you so long, honey?
- I put the coffee on.
On second thought, I think I'd rather have tea.
Naomi.
You burned it.
It looks like a king-size prune.
Well, it just needs to be basted.
Oh, it's hopeless.
Mrs. Tate.
Yes?
What happened?
You see?
The secret's in the basting.
Where have you been?
As if I didn't know.
Darrin, I just can't stand by idle.
Oh, yes, you can.
Larry Tate's getting exactly what he deserves.
But Louise isn't.
You're not a woman, so you don't understand.
One fiasco dinner party can open wounds that may never heal!
It's worse than wearing slacks when everybody else is wearing dresses.
- Darrin, please.
- Please, what?
Let me go back and help Naomi.
I promise I'll never use witchcraft again.
You will?
Well, I'll promise to try and taper off.
Oh, I've got to get back before something drastic happens.
Just because I'm having a beef with Larry is no reason to take it out on Louise.
Well, thank you.
I've got to go make dessert.
Swell.
I suppose you've got a great dessert planned.
Cherries Jubilee.
Boy, I should get that lucky.
You just have.
Well, back to Naomi.
Good.
Everything's ready to serve.
You see, I told you you didn't need Mrs. Stephens around.
I guess not.
I've got a very funny feeling, though.
It's as if someone's watching over me.
Nonsense.
You're a marvellous cook.
As I said, somebody up there likes me.
Honey, this is the worst breakfast I've ever eaten.
I let Naomi cook it herself.
In line with my new policy of trying to give up witchcraft.
- When are you gonna fire her?
- Soon.
When is soon?
As soon as her son graduates from medical school.
- Honey, that's - Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
I have something to tell you.
You're the most wonderful people I've ever worked for so therefore, I'm quitting.
- You are?
You are?
You deserve the absolute tops in domestic help.
And let's face it, I am not the absolute tops.
Sooner or later you'd fire me so I'd like to quit now before the baby comes because even though I wouldn't do right by it I know I'd fall in love with it, and I couldn't bear to leave it.
So it'll work better all around if I leave now.
Oh, here's an estimate of my breakage.
Now, Naomi, you put that away.
I told you we were insured.
Oh, this is what I broke at Mrs. Tate's.
Three, 9, 10, carry 1.
Eight, 11, 15, carry 1.
Seventeen dollars and 50 cents.
Well.
Naomi, will you wait for me in the kitchen, please?
Yes, ma'am.
Darrin, did you hear how she added these figures?
- She's a good adder.
- Think you could get her a job in your accounting department?
I bet I could.
That would kill three birds with one stone.
- How three?
- One it's a good job that she could keep.
Two, she'd be making a bigger salary and can send more money to her son.
And three, I could go back to not having a maid.
Honey, do you really not want to have a maid?
More than anything I've ever not wanted in my life.
- Will you look into it this morning?
- I'll look into it this morning.
Naomi.
Mr. Stephens has just had a brilliant suggestion.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
We ought to call your parents and let them know we're going to the hospital.
Sweetheart, we haven't got time.
I'll call them later.
- How about Derek?
- I'll call him too.
- Do we know a Derek?
- Not yet.
I thought it might be a nice name if it was a boy.
Honey, we can decide on that later.
How about your mother?
Should we let her know?
Oh, don't worry, she'll be there.
- Don't answer it.
- It'll only take a minute.
Now, you run out and get the car.
- Hello?
- Samantha.
This is Serena.
Your cousin Serena.
Well, Serena.
What are you doing in town?
Well, darling, it's the in place to be at this time of year.
When are you having the baby?
Oh, in an hour or so.
- Well, I guess that kills lunch.
- Probably dinner too.
Look, why don't I pop into the hospital and brighten your stay.
Marvellous.
I'll be at the Perkins Hospital and - What did you say?
- Nothing.
But I think someone is trying to tell me something.
Bye-bye, Serena.
- Sam, are you all right?
- Oh, I'm fine.
Just fine.
Darling?
How about "Serena," if it's a girl?
If you don't hurry, we may end up calling the baby "Freeway" because that's where it's going to be born.
This your first one?
- How can you tell?
- You're smoking my pipe.
Sorry.
You bit through the stem.
Oh, I'll buy you a new one.
That's all right.
It was about shot anyway.
Well, tell me, what do you want, a boy or a girl?
Oh, I don't care, just so long as it's mortal.
Just so long as it's - What?
- You know what I mean.
Human.
I mean healthy!
I think you could do with a cup of coffee.
No, thanks.
I've had so much coffee, I slosh when I walk.
Well, I could use some.
I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Why are you wearing that?
- I just came from the delivery room.
- You were in there with Sam?
- I thought it was a mother's place.
- They couldn't see me, of course.
- How is she?
Samantha just presented me with the most beautiful granddaughter.
You mean, I'm - I'm the father of a girl?
- That too.
Well, that's just great.
And Sam?
How's Sam?
She's fine.
She's fine.
Endora, I don't know what to do first, to hug you or offer you a cigar.
There's no other choice?
I have a daughter!
- Are you a good swimmer?
- I can't swim a stroke.
Well, we'd better use these.
Thanks.
Well, how does she look?
- Absolutely adorable.
- Yeah.
- Talented too.
- Talented?
Yes.
With the most marvellous sense of humour.
Humour.
The baby?
Well, I thought it was just too funny.
When the doctor slapped her to make her cry she turned around and slapped him back.
- Really?
- No.
No, I was just teasing.
You know, Endora, sometimes, you can be almost human.
This is no time to be insulting.
Here he is.
- You look beautiful.
- So do you.
- You're a mother.
- You're a father.
Well, while you two are trying to identify each other l'll go get your daughter.
- I love you.
- I love you.
- We had a girl.
- A girl.
- A daughter.
- A girl.
I'm very proud of you.
I'm proud of both of us.
We had a girl.
A baby girl.
Sam, I'm a father.
And I'm a mother.
I thought you two had that all worked out.
Now, would you like to hold your daughter?
Isn't she beautiful?
I think she's beautiful.
Don't get too close.
And don't sit on the bed.
Hi there.
You think we ought to do something about her name?
Darling?
What do you think of "Tabatha"?
Tabatha?
Crazy about it, huh?
Well, where did you happen to get a name like Tabatha?
Well, as a matter of fact Mother suggested it.
- I see.
But if you don't like it, we can choose another name.
Should we do it right away?
Shouldn't she have her name around her wrist?
No.
All they put on the bracelet is "Girl Stephens".
"Tabatha Steph" Tabatha.
I don't understand.
- Mother.
- Oh, boy, it started already.
I've got to check into this.
Couldn't I hold her just a moment longer?
I'm afraid not, honey.
She needs her beauty sleep.
Something very strange about this.
No one is supposed to tamper with these ID bracelets.
I'm afraid you'll have to run along too, Pop.
- Already?
- Your wife's had enough excitement.
You've got 30 seconds.
Thirty seconds.
I'll see you later.
Sam.
Is she or isn't she?
Darling, you know as much as I do.
But if she starts levitating bottles in the nursery, let me know, huh?
Your 30 seconds are up.
My dear, darling child.
How are you feeling?
Happy.
Contented.
And much flatter.
And how is little Tabatha?
Mother there's something I have to talk to you about.
We haven't decided on a name yet.
I don't care what you call her.
- You don't?
- No.
Whatever you call her, I shall call her "Tabatha".
- Mother.
- Well, I thought you liked the name.
I do, but that's not the point.
We'd like to decide for ourselves.
Well, we'll see.
Have they let you hold her?
It was only for a minute.
I wish they'd let me keep her longer.
Those ridiculous hospital rules.
I brought you something.
- Well, I appreciate the gesture.
- Nonsense.
What are all these flowers and you doing in this room?
I am her mother.
Well, you'll have to wait until this afternoon.
And these flowers have got to go.
Too many flowers use up all the oxygen in the room.
How did you manage to get in here?
I didn't think Houdini could do it.
Houdini had a lot to learn.
Goodbye, Grandma.
Why do I have to leave?
Because we are about to take our nap.
"Our nap"?
Are you going to climb into bed too?
I was using the royal "we".
Are you a member of royalty?
Yes.
I'm queen of this floor.
That means I can tell you when to visit and when not.
When did you get out of charm school?
Well, let me put it another way: Get out.
Mother, I think you've met your match.
No.
We'll see.
You can come back this afternoon - Where'd she go?
- Oh, she just popped out.
Well, I didn't mean to hurt her feelings.
But after all, looking after you is my business and that's what I intend to do.
I'm gonna clear these flowers out, and you're going to take a nap.
And no nonsense.
Samantha?
Serena?
Oh, my, you grew up to be a very nice-looking girl.
You too.
Hi.
Isn't there someone looking after my grandchild?
They say crying is good for them.
She is beautiful, isn't she?
- For once, we're in complete agreement.
- Luckily, she takes after Samantha.
She does look like Sam.
But I think there's a little bit of me there too.
Yes, but the wrinkles will disappear soon.
- I meant the hair.
It's dark like mine.
- Baby fuzz.
It'll rub off soon.
No, she'll grow up to look just like Samantha.
- What makes you so sure?
- I'll prove it to you, if you like.
- How?
- I'll turn her into a young lady for a few minutes, and then you'll see.
If you so much as look at my daughter the wrong way I wish I could break you of the habit of making empty threats.
- Endora!
- Let's not fight, Derek.
Let's not fight.
In front of the baby.
Oh, by the way, have you told your mother and father about the birth yet?
Oh, no, I haven't.
How come you're suddenly so concerned about my parents?
Oh, stop being so suspicious.
Now, be a good boy, and run along and phone them.
Yeah, I suppose I should.
There.
All you needed was to be picked up, wasn't it?
Now, we'll go for a little walk and then we'll take you to your mommy.
Yes, yes.
I'd like to leave a little plaything for the baby.
I thought a centaur might be nice.
Serena I have to explain something.
You see, my husband is mortal.
You poor dear.
If you really wanna get her something why don't you buy her a rattle.
Darling, you're positively brilliant!
I'd never have thought of that.
It takes practice.
At least let me leave you a little something.
Serena, I hate to seem ungrateful but they have a rule about too many flowers in the room.
As a matter of fact, you're not even supposed to be here.
Yes, I know.
An old biddy nurse tried to stop me outside.
That must've been Miss Kelton.
Better leave before she gets back.
Darling, she's been here all the time.
Where?
That's Nurse Kelton!
Serena, you turn her back.
Oh, very well, darling.
Don't get excited.
Where am I?
Might have known she'd say something cliché.
And all these flowers back in here again!
I was sure I put those out.
I told you the hospital doesn't like so many flowers.
What's going on?
- Where are the flowers?
- What flowers?
You didn't see any flowers?
No.
- You?
- No.
I did.
Miss Kelton, don't let it worry you.
Oh, I'm not worried, honey.
I've been a nurse for 20 years.
I know there's a logical explanation for everything that happens.
There's one for my seeing the flowers.
What's that?
The job is getting to me.
Where'd she go?
Pardon me.
Could you tell me where I could buy a rattle?
Why, yes.
Tippett's Toy Store is two blocks away.
You just Thank you.
You see, I'm completely new here and What's the matter?
Have we met somewhere before?
No, but I've heard that line somewhere before.
Where's my baby?
!
Mr. Stephens - Mr. Stephens.
- Where's my baby?
- Now, don't be alarmed.
- You mean she's gone?
!
She must be around here somewhere.
Endora.
She did it.
She's completely new here, and she wanted a rattle.
- A rattle?
- She can't get away with this.
- It's criminal!
- Who's Endora?
She took my baby's childhood away from her.
I've gotta stop her.
Oh, I've got to get out of this business.
- It's on the corner.
You can't miss it.
- Thank you.
Please!
Please don't go.
- Get back to the nursery.
- I beg your pardon.
You see, I'm your father.
Your daddy.
Me, Da-da.
Da-da.
Are you a psychiatric patient here?
Quick, back into your bassinet.
- What is all this?
- Please.
You'll miss your feeding.
Please believe me.
Look, I wasn't born yesterday, you know.
I know.
You were born today.
Please get back to the nursery.
No.
You get back to the nursery.
Just what do you think you're doing in here?
I'm sorry, wrong room.
Miss Foster did you just see a fully grown man in here sucking a pacifier?
No, I didn't, Nurse Kelton.
Thought not.
Now, Mother, you take her back before they miss her.
Well, the least they could do is give her a private room.
Hey, little Tabatha.
Her name is not Tabatha.
- Where did you get that baby?
- From the nursery.
- She was crying.
- Give her to me.
Give her to me.
I have a good mind to report you to the authorities.
Oh, please.
Please, Miss Kelton, she means well.
Look, Grandma, I've had just about enough of you.
I am not your grandmother.
Don't be mad at her.
You see, Mother's a little eccentric.
Sooner or later, it happens to all of us, honey.
Happens to all of us.
Darrin.
How are you, old buddy?
- Oh, hi, Dave.
- So, what's new?
- Nothing.
- You seem kind of harried.
I thought new fathers were Now, that is something.
What do you mean by that?
I mean there is a great-looking chick.
How would you like a punch in the mouth?
!
- Are you kidding?
All I said was - I'm warning you, Dave, knock it off!
Oh, great.
- I've got to talk to you.
- Not you again.
You shouldn't be walking around like this.
Really?
Well, you shouldn't be walking around like that.
How can you do this to your daddy?
What's going on here?
I know this all looks very strange but there is an explanation.
You see, I'm her father.
Sure.
You're her daddy, right?
She was born when you were I know it doesn't add up, but she's - She's gone.
I've got to stop her!
- You're not going anywhere.
Well, you're too late.
My baby's out on the town.
Do you really think you should wear that outfit at your age?
- Do you know this gentleman?
- Yes, he's a distant relative.
You know how it is.
Every family has one.
- I wanna have a talk, in private.
- Oh, very well.
Come on over here.
Now, what did you want to talk to me about?
How could you do this, Endora?
How could you take my baby's childhood away from her?
From us?
What are you babbling about?
I never even had a chance to take her to the zoo.
She never rode a merry-go-around or had braces on her teeth or anything.
- Who didn't?
- Don't play dumb with me, Endora.
You've done some pretty rotten things but I didn't think you'd stoop this low.
You're an irresponsible Careful.
You're asking for it.
I'm not asking for anything.
I'm telling you to take me to my daughter.
Well, if that's what you want.
Look, just for the record, I'd like to ask you something: You're not really here, right?
I mean, I saw you here earlier with a pacifier in your mouth and now I see you here in your Indian suit.
But it's all in my imagination, right?
You don't really exist, right?
- Right.
- Thanks.
Dr. Hassenblatt?
Nurse Kelton.
I'd like to make an appointment for a complete psychiatric examination.
Thanks for the rattle, Serena.
- Darling, it was nothing.
- Sam, I've got!
- Darrin!
- You found her.
Who's that?
This is really getting very dreary.
Well, one more time.
Why did you do that?
Oh, it's a long, dull story, darling.
But don't worry, they'll come and get him soon.
What was she talking about?
Not there.
I've tried to cure myself but once a practical joker, always a practical joker, I guess.
If he promises never to play any of his practical jokes in the hospital again will you just forget the whole incident?
Okay, but only for two reasons.
- What are they?
- I like your wife.
- What's the other?
- I'm so relieved to find that you're the fruitcake and not me.
Nurse Kelton, you're a doll.
You've got one minute before I throw you out of here.
And don't sit on the bed!
Now, darling, would you mind telling me what happened to you today?
Honey, it would be impossible in one minute.
Well, did you find your daughter in good health?
Oh, yes.
Tabatha is fine.
- Tabatha?
- Tabatha?
Yes.
After yelling at you this morning, I figure I owe you something.
- Besides, she looks like a Tabatha.
- Oh, well, thank you.
Well, I'm sure you three would like to be left alone.
- You're leaving?
- One good turn deserves another.
There.
You see?
Mother isn't all bad.
Right, Tabatha?
Darling, I think she has my nose.
Sam, you mean?
No, no.
I just mean it looks like mine.
We'll have to wait to see if she has any Honey, you're a witch.
Can't you tell anything just by looking at her?
Only that I love her.
Some witch.
Even I can tell that.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Sam.
The baby is crying.
She probably wants her bottle.
Okay, I'll be a good father and get it myself.
Darrin, the baby is crying.
She had me up and down all night long.
So would you mind if just this once I gave her her bottle by?
You wouldn't?
Thanks.
Samantha.
Samantha, wake up.
Samantha!
What's wrong?
I now have positive proof that our baby is a full-blooded witch.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Your old man has to go to work.
Darrin.
You haven't apologized to her for accusing her of being a full-blooded witch.
Now, you know that's impossible.
Why?
Her mother is a witch.
But you're not.
You're a mortal.
So the most she can be is a half-blooded witch.
You're right.
I apologize.
- Good morning.
- Oh, hello.
Excuse us for barging in, but we want to give the baby a present.
In honour of being born.
Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Kravitz, you shouldn't have.
You see, Gladys?
Just because they sent an announcement didn't mean we had to.
- Oh, Abner, stop kidding.
- He's just kidding.
- Well, come right on in.
Darrin, the Kravitzes brought Tabatha a present.
Mr. And Mrs. Kravitz, you shouldn't have.
Oh, don't be silly.
It was our pleasure.
Oh, is so pretty.
You are so pretty.
You're the prettiest little girl.
You're getting prettier every day.
Gladys, please, no baby talk.
It upsets my stomach worse than her cooking.
Tell them about the gift, Gladys.
Well, we got, in the baby's very own name one share of stock in Kapoopsie Woolens.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Darrin, isn't that wonderful?
It certainly is.
What's Kapoopsie Woolens?
It's not Kapoopsie.
It's Poughkeepsie, as in the city of the same name.
Poughkeepsie, New York.
I thought you said Kapoopsie.
I've been a stockholder in it for 20 years.
And in those 20 years, the price of the stock never went down.
Or up.
That's what makes it a sound investment.
Thank you, from both of us.
From all three of us.
You're entirely welcome.
We bought it through my cousin Julius.
If you ever need a good stockbroker, I recommend him.
His name is Cushman.
Julius Cushman.
As a matter of fact, I just happen to have one of his cards.
"One share of common stock.
Stockholder's name: Tabatha Stephens".
Well, Tabatha, you're a Wall Street tycoon.
- I don't believe it.
- What's the matter, Julius?
A stock that hasn't moved in 20 years just went up six points.
- What's the name of it?
- Poughkeepsie Woolens.
Samantha.
Honey.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, darling.
Where's Tabatha?
She's upstairs.
I was just gonna take up her laundry.
I'll go with you.
As soon as I tell you what happened.
- At the office?
- No.
On Wall Street.
Poughkeepsie Woolens, which opened at $9 per share closed at $15 per share.
In other words, it leaped $6.
How about that.
- I bet Tabatha brought it luck.
- That's one way of putting it.
There's another?
Sam, being a devoted mother did you use a little witchcraft to put in the fix?
I most certainly did not.
- That would be highly unethical.
- Okay.
I'm sorry.
But how do you explain that after 20 years this stock suddenly jumps?
Easy.
After 20 years, it was probably overdue.
Honey, that isn't the way the stock market works.
Now the value of these stocks depends Hold everything.
What about your mother?
What about my mother what?
Maybe she used a little witchcraft to feather her granddaughter's nest.
Being highly unethical wouldn't stop her.
Darrin, be logical.
If Mother wanted to feather her granddaughter's nest she would not tamper with stocks.
She'd merely whip up a couple of million dollars cash.
You're right.
So it wasn't either one of you.
Come on, let's go see the baby.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, my darling.
You know what?
Congratulations.
Your stock went up six points.
Sam, did you see that?
She smiled.
Yes.
She probably has a little gas.
No, honey.
She understood me.
I told her her stock went up six points, and she expressed satisfaction.
How can she possibly understand?
She's just a baby.
She is not just a baby.
She's your baby.
Maybe Tabatha did it herself.
Maybe she used her own powers to influence the stock market.
Darling, we aren't even sure she has any powers.
We're not sure that she hasn't.
- There's only one way to find out.
- How?
We'll conduct an experiment.
What kind of experiment?
We'll buy a second share of stock, see what happens to it.
And we'll make it very scientific.
We'll let her pick the stock.
Darling, Tabatha can't read.
She's not old enough.
Just a minute.
Pick a stock.
Pick a stock.
Pick a stock, darling.
Pick a stock.
But she can point.
That's not pointing.
That's playing with the newspaper.
"Nelson Aerodynamics".
Closed at $12.
I'll buy her one share tomorrow.
Sweetheart.
Don't you think it's a little silly to throw away $12 on something silly?
No, honey.
We have to find out if she is or if she isn't.
- This is the only way.
- There's another way.
- What way?
- Wait a year and ask her.
I'll place the order tomorrow through Mrs. Kravitz's cousin.
Frank.
Are you familiar with a dog on the market called Nelson Aerodynamics?
And how.
It's a real nothing.
Don't tell me you bought it.
Yep.
For my cousin's neighbour's baby.
And it just went up five points.
Samantha.
Samantha!
Oh, I'll be right out.
I'm just heating Tabatha's bottle.
Don't you look at me so innocently.
Now, I know you don't know any better.
But you cannot tamper with the American economy.
I realize it's not your fault, and I'm not blaming you.
But it's got to stop.
Now, this is very serious, and it's very complicated.
So I want you to listen closely.
When the stocks act strangely, the public panics.
And that causes disasters like the big crash in 1929.
You wouldn't want to throw your country into another depression, would you?
I don't believe it.
I simply don't believe it.
A grown man giving a lecture on the stock market to a tiny baby.
Sam, this tiny baby made herself $10 and a half in one day.
Nelson Aerodynamics closed at 22 and one-half.
It did?
What are you so happy about?
That means the experiment worked.
- It did?
- Yes, it did.
That proves that our baby not only has powers but she uses them for her own selfish personal profit.
Darrin, maybe I know, Sam, it's not her fault.
But somehow she's got to develop a sense of responsibility.
She's a tiny baby.
I know, that's what makes it so tough.
Somehow I've got to make her realize the significance of the national economy.
Oh, my stars.
Oh, Tabatha.
Isn't Daddy funny?
He thinks you've been wheeling and dealing in the stock market.
How about that.
You, a sweet, adorable baby.
And if you have, be a good girl and cut it out, huh?
Hello.
Good morning, Gladys.
Julius.
Listen, I was surprised to hear that Poughkeepsie went up too.
I'll tell you why I phoned.
Your neighbour Mr. Stephens must have some hot inside information on the mark et.
Yesterday, he bought a stock that went up 10 and a half points in one day.
So if you wanna gamble I suggest you get him to give you a few tips.
Why, thank you, Julius.
We'll do that.
Thank you for calling.
Listen, give my love to Henrietta and the parakeets.
- Goodbye.
- Bye.
- Who called?
- My cousin Julius.
Abner, if we play our cards right, we can get rich.
Did Poughkeepsie go up again?
No.
We're gonna sell that stock.
And we're gonna buy what Mr. Stephens tells us.
Julius says he must have some hot inside information.
- Gladys.
- Come on.
Let's go talk to him.
Gladys, if I say I refuse to discuss the subject further, let's drop it what would you do?
- I would nag you so unmercifully you'd think I never nagged you before.
That's what I thought.
Let's go.
All right, Tabatha.
I'm gonna take your diapers upstairs, and then it's time for your bath.
He probably left for work.
Don't ring the bell until I see if his car is here.
Oh, okay.
You want your new dolly to come too?
I bet you do.
All right.
As long as I only have two hands.
The garage is empty.
Let's go home and forget it.
Abner.
I'll take a wild guess.
You saw something so peculiar it exceeds the boundaries of man's imagination.
Yes.
I saw the Stephens' baby fly.
That's terrific.
Most kids her age can't even walk.
Oh, Abner, why won't you ever believe me?
Gladys, where did the Stephens' baby fly to?
Upstairs.
Toward her room.
She's probably made a three-point landing right in her crib.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- You're holding the baby in your arms.
Oh, I do that a lot.
Gladys thought the baby would be in her room.
Oh, she's en route to get her bath.
Would you mind letting us come up and watch?
Well, it's not that spectacular, you know.
Maybe not to you, but it would brighten up our drab lives.
Well, to tell you the truth, I'm still a little nervous.
I'm only a novice, and I'm not sure I'm ready for an audience yet.
That's okay.
We're easy to please.
Okay.
Just remember I'm still a beginner.
Abner, since when do you like to watch babies take baths?
Not babies, Gladys.
Baby.
I wanna show you there's only one, a non-flier.
Oh, thank you.
There you go.
Now, you just relax.
The trick to bathing a baby is to get everything ready in advance.
My cousin says that Mr. Stephens bought a stock that went up 10 and a half points in one day.
- Ten and a half points?
- In one day.
Oh, beginner's luck.
How did Mr. Stephens pick that stock out?
Oh, just a hunch, I guess.
Maybe Tabatha gave him a tip on it.
I forgot the soap.
Excuse me.
Gladys, what are you doing?
What's it look like I'm doing?
I'm snooping.
Abner.
Here's today's paper, folded at the financial page.
So what?
Abner, how can you be so dense?
Didn't you hear her say that the baby gave him a tip?
And then we find the paper in the nursery.
Don't you see?
Like mother like daughter.
Gladys, can you be more specific?
Well, it's obvious.
Tabatha made that stock go up And she did the same thing for Kapoopsie Woolens.
Gladys, for the last time, it's not Kapoopsie.
It's Poughkeepsie.
Alrighty.
Now, all we need is the water.
She wants the paper.
Just like kids.
They wanna play with everything but their toys.
She's not playing.
She's picking a stock.
"East South Dakota Petroleum".
She's telling us to buy East South Dakota Petroleum.
That's funny.
I didn't hear her say a word.
Don't you see?
She's bribing us.
She's telling us, "Aunt Gladys and Uncle Abner if you'll keep my secret, I'll make you rich".
You don't have to make us rich.
We'll keep your secret if you keep ours.
- What's our secret?
- Aunt Gladys is sick in the head and needs a thorough psychiatric examination which Uncle Abner is now going home to arrange.
Abner, wait!
Well, that was close.
Abner.
Wait till I tell you what Mrs. Stephens did to the water.
I just got home and saw the sign.
- "Room for rent"?
- Out of necessity.
This morning, we sold our Poughkeepsie Woolens and invested all our money in East South Dakota Petroleum.
By this afternoon, it had dropped 21 points.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
And you haven't heard the worst part.
My wife says she invested in the stock because she got a magic message from your daughter.
Pathetic, isn't it?
Darrin, don't yell.
You'll wake up the baby.
How can she sleep?
She just destroyed the life savings of a sweet, middle-aged couple.
You're not making any sense.
Gladys got a tip from Tabatha, and the stock went down.
- That proves one thing.
- What?
If Tabatha gave Mrs. Kravitz a tip on the stock market which you believe she did and I don't Tabatha would've used her powers which you believe she has and I don't to make the stock go up, not down as she did before, which you believe she did and I don't.
- Not necessarily.
- Why not?
The stock wasn't purchased in her name.
Really.
What are you doing, reporting her to the SEC?
I am ordering her one share of East South Dakota Petroleum so tomorrow when it rises, it takes the Kravitzes off the hook.
May I speak to Mr. Julius Cushman, please?
Mr. Cushman, Darrin Stephens.
Please give me the closing price on East South Dakota Petroleum.
With pleasure.
After a severe, early afternoon dip East South Dak Pet rallied to close where it opened at $30 per share.
You're kidding.
How come?
I see.
Who told you?
Our research department.
While I was at it I had them tell me what happened with Poughkeepsie Woolen and Nelson Aero.
Oh, what?
What did happen?
I see.
Well, that's very interesting, Mr. Cushman.
No, no.
I think I'll just play it cool.
Oh, thank you.
What is interesting?
Well, East South Dakota Petroleum bounced back so tomorrow the Kravitzes can sell and break even.
What made it bounce back?
You wouldn't understand, honey.
It's very dull.
I think I'd find it fascinating.
What happened?
Well, the earlier dip was caused by a rumour that a new oil well failed to strike oil.
Well, they found out the rumour wasn't true.
It just bounced back up.
How about Poughkeepsie Woolens?
Honey, how about a martini?
How about letting Tabatha off the hook?
Okay.
Poughkeepsie Woolens bounced back because of the discovery of a new synthetic fabric.
And how about Nelson Aerodynamics?
There's no way I can get out of this?
Nope.
Nelson Aerodynamics went up because they got a government contract.
There were three logical reasons for the way the stocks acted.
- Tabatha had nothing to do with it?
- You could say that.
Yes.
I did.
Now you can make me that martini.
Sam, I just had a terrible thought.
What?
Supposing it appeared that there were logical reasons for the stocks bouncing around.
- Supposing she knew they'd strike oil.
- Darrin.
She knew they'd discover a new synthetic.
- You can't blame me for wondering.
- Lf you don't stop this do you know what's gonna happen?
- What?
You're gonna turn into another Gladys Kravitz.
You just cured me.
Thanks.
Alrighty, madam, let's see what we can do here.
- Good morning, ladies.
- Oh, good morning, Da-da.
Oh, it sure is nice sleeping in late on Sunday, right?
Oh, well, we ladies wouldn't know.
We were up at 6:00.
Sam.
Is Tabatha up to her old tricks again?
Hardly.
This is yesterday's sports page.
I'm using it to line the wastepaper basket.
Yeah, honey, but she put her finger on the entries at Aqueduct.
On a horse in the first race named Princess Jennie.
Darrin, you're not gonna start that again.
Well, as long as it was yesterday's paper, let's just take a look and see.
First race at Aqueduct was won by Dirty Arnold beating Princess Jennie in a photo finish.
- There, you see?
- I see.
Unless Princess Jennie didn't win because she didn't have a bet on it.
Darrin, will you please?
Will you please?
Yes, Sam.
Will I please what?
Will you please hold Tabatha while I finish lining the wastebasket?
Who do you like in the fourth?
Darrin.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
You like that?
Honey, take a look at this.
"To Miss Tabatha Stephens".
Her first letter.
How about that?
- Who's it from?
- It's from my folks.
Anything new?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Yeah, they're coming to see Tabatha in two weeks.
Oh, marvellous.
It'll be fun seeing them.
Well, that depends.
The last time they visited it wasn't exactly my idea of fun.
Well, darling, it wasn't my fault that Aunt Clara picked the same weekend to visit.
I was surprised when she came down the chimney.
Is that how she arrived?
Poor dear.
She was so lonely.
I didn't have the heart to turn her away.
Oh, it's so nice to see you again.
Oh, and it's nice to see you too, dear.
Oh, well.
We'll have a lovely weekend together.
- Weekend?
- Doorknobs are all very well but they're not family.
- Aunt Clara.
I count them when I'm lonely.
But somehow, you know today, they didn't seem to do the trick.
And then I remembered the lovely invitation you gave me to come here whenever I wanted to.
I see.
Where's that nice mortal you're married to?
Darrin went to pick up his parents.
They're spending the weekend too.
Oh?
Oh, I picked a bad time for a visit.
Well, never mind, I'll leave before they arrive.
No, you won't.
Now, I haven't met Darrin's parents.
It'd be kind of nice to have you around for moral support.
Besides, we have plenty of room.
Now, you're sure I won't be in the way?
Of course not, and I'd like them to meet my favourite aunt.
Oh, you are a nice girl.
Now, why don't I show you to your room and you can get cleaned up and rest before you have to meet Darrin and his parents.
No, I think I'll wait for my bag and umbrella.
They weren't ready and packed when I wanted to go.
So I just left them there.
Teach them a lesson.
I can't wait to see him.
I hope she hasn't let him lose weight.
He can't afford to lose weight.
Oh, he's probably in the last stages of malnutrition.
You know that isn't what I meant.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, Darrin!
Oh, Darrin.
Uh-oh, here come the waterworks.
Three months away and it's like he's back from the grave.
Oh, it's too long for a son to be away from his mother, much too long.
Marriage obviously agrees with you, boy.
I've never seen you look better.
Have you, Phyllis?
Oh, he looks terrible.
How can you say he looks well?
He looks terrible.
Have you been eating the right foods, Darrin?
Oh, I feel great, Mom, honestly.
Never mind, I'll fatten you up with some good home cooking in a couple of days.
Meet my wife, the diplomat.
Now what did I say wrong?
There's our luggage.
Sam's a pretty good cook too, Mom.
- Sam?
- Samantha.
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, I'm sure she is, dear and you know I'd cut off my right arm rather than interfere.
I just thought I'd give her a few tips, though.
Can she make chicken cacciatore?
No, Mom.
No one can make chicken cacciatore the way you can.
Oh, it's nice that there's something you need your mother for.
Let's go.
I'm anxious to meet this bride of yours, Darrin.
- I bet she's something really special.
- Pop, you win your bet.
Oh, there you are.
I told you I wouldn't wait for you.
Well, don't stand there like that.
Come in, come in, come in.
Now, your room is the second on the left.
I'll check dinner and be right up.
Oh, it smells good.
Pot roast.
I wanted to serve something more exotic, but I thought I ought to stay on safe ground.
- Exotic?
Yes, you know, beef stroganoff, coq au vin something that would really impress Darrin's mother.
Don't you worry, dear.
I just know they're going to love you.
How can you be so sure?
I'm a witch.
I can't tell you how excited I was when we heard Darrin was married.
Fainted four times.
Four!
Oh, he's exaggerating, as usual.
Oh, I will admit that I was surprised, but I'm not one of those mothers who want to keep their children tied to their apron strings.
Then why is everything in Darrin's room bronzed?
Well, there's nothing wrong with being sentimental.
I think it's rather nice.
His tennis racket?
Why don't you two men leave us alone so I can get acquainted with my daughter-in-law.
- Come on, I'll show you your room.
- Right.
You treat her well now, Phyllis.
I like this girl.
Now we can talk.
I just wanted you to know that you don't have to worry about me being one of those interfering mother-in-laws.
Why, I'd cut off my right arm first.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
Of course, if you do need any help, I'm always available.
That's nice to know.
Well, I do know a little more about Darrin's habits than you.
So if there's anything you want to know anything at all, feel free to ask.
Darrin tells me you're a good cook.
Well, I'm still learning.
Oh, good.
That is, maybe I can give you the recipes for some of his very favourite dishes.
Do you know how to make pineapple upside-down cake?
No, I don't.
Then there are his hives.
I don't know how to make those either.
No, no, dear, that's an allergy.
It's a rash he gets.
I'll show you how to treat it.
Oh, I've cured that.
You cured his rash?
Oh, yes.
We found out he only got it when he ate chicken cacciatore.
I see.
My, this is a lovely room.
Did you?
Did you have a decorator?
No, I did it myself.
Well, it's absolutely lovely.
I'll bet you can't wait to get it finished.
Finished?
Oh, really all it needs is a few knickknacks to warm it up.
Darrin is used to that.
He always had them at home.
Oh, I've got more than enough.
I'll send you some when I get back.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Darrin, I was just telling Samantha how lovely the room looks.
Yes, it does have nice, clean look.
I hate a room that's all cluttered up with ornaments.
You know, we really don't know very much about you, Samantha.
What did you do before you married Darrin?
Well, I travelled a lot.
- With your family?
- Sometimes.
Do you get to see much of your mother?
Oh, she pops in and out.
And what about the rest of your family?
Hello, Aunt Clara.
Hello, everybody.
Come on, I want you to meet everybody.
Aunt Clara, this is Mrs. Stephens and Mr. Stephens.
- How do you do?
And that is Darrin.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
You haven't met Darrin before?
Oh, well I've met him, but he hasn't met me.
In the flesh, I mean.
So to speak.
Aunt Clara is spending the weekend with us too.
She is?
I mean, she is?
Wouldn't you like to see my doorknob collection?
Why, yes, l I beg your pardon?
- Aunt Clara collects doorknobs.
- I have 3000.
- Where'd you get them all?
- I don't remember but there are a lot of people having a heck of time trying to open their doors.
Samantha, could I speak to you for a minute?
- When?
- Now.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Maybe this will be a nice chance for us to have a little chat.
Darling, I was just as surprised as you were.
I turned around and she was sitting in the fireplace.
- She came down the chimney?
Well, darling, you can't blame someone for being old.
She used to come through the wall, same as everybody else.
- Oh, great.
- She's really very sweet.
I'm sure, darling.
I'd love to have her here any other time but not this weekend.
My parents are plain, simple folks Darrin, Darrin, darling, I can't ask her to leave.
I couldn't bear to see her hurt.
You can understand that, can't you?
- I suppose so, honey.
- I know it's inconvenient but I'm sure your parents will understand.
Besides, what possible harm could she do?
Yes, I'm a witch.
All my family are.
Sort of a family thing that has been handed down, you know.
Bu the witch game is not like it used to be.
Oh, no.
Now there was a time when you could cast a spell on someone and they knew it.
Not now.
No, not now.
- Well, now, take the Yankees.
- The Yankees?
Well, they lost two World Series in a row, didn't they?
You put a spell on them.
Well, Bertha and me.
Yeah.
Bertha and you?
Oh, well, I'm so glad you don't mind.
- Mind?
- About Samantha being one.
Samantha's a witch too?
Yes, yes, but she's trying to get away from it.
Bothers Darrin.
Well, I think I'll go for a little fresh air, if you don't mind.
Shan't be long.
Why, I used to go through a wall: Just like butter.
I think I'll try the front door.
She's kind of cute, isn't she?
What about your sister Madge?
It's not the same thing at all.
Madge has a quirk, that's all.
Quirk?
She thinks she's a lighthouse.
You call standing on the garage roof when it rains to warn ships at sea a quirk?
That woman believes she's a witch.
Now you can't tell me that's normal.
Well, Darrin isn't married to Clara, and I think Samantha is a perfect wife.
Perfect?
She can't even make a pineapple upside-down cake.
What kind of a family has poor Darrin married into?
Darrin, think everything's going all right?
I don't know what you're so worried about, Pop thinks you're great.
- Yes, but what about your mother?
- I'm sure she likes you too.
Obviously the flight upset her.
She's just not herself, that's all.
Well, I don't know, I just don't know.
I've a funny feeling something's out of whack.
The only thing out of whack is your Aunt Clara.
At least you know where you stand with her.
Well, has Mom said anything?
Oh, no, of course not.
I know she's trying to be nice.
I've done everything I can to please her.
Just don't know.
I have a funny feeling, that's all.
There's something wrong.
Hello, dears.
Everything all right?
Yes, everything's ready.
Just keep your fingers crossed.
Oh, I don't believe in superstition.
I just know that everything is going to be perfect.
Oh, dear.
I better go empty the ashtrays in the living room.
Sam Clara, Clara, don't goof this up.
Coq au vin.
Go away, chickie.
Go away, chickie.
Go away, chickie.
Oh, now that's better.
Now for dessert, pineapple upside-down cake.
It'd be just my luck if it came up right-side up.
I'm on a winning streak.
- Please sit down, Mr. Stephens.
- Fine.
Aunt Clara, make yourself comfortable.
Hey, that smells great.
What is it?
Pot roast.
I would like to have served you something, well, more exciting but cooking really isn't one of my That's coq au vin.
Samantha.
- That's what it is, all right.
- Oh, it looks delicious.
I thought you said you couldn't cook.
Quite a sense of humour this girl of yours has, Darrin.
Yeah, she keeps me laughing all day.
How'd you know it was my favourite?
Oh, does Mrs. Stephens cook it for you?
Cook it?
She can't even pronounce it.
You must be a great cook.
Oh, you wait until you see the dessert she's whipped up for you.
What is it, Samantha?
Maybe it should be a surprise.
Pineapple upside-down cake.
Well, Phyllis, I guess you can stop worrying now.
Our boy couldn't be in better hands.
What's the matter?
I have a sick headache.
Been at it again, haven't you?
They'll hear you.
Zap, coq au vin!
Whap, pineapple upside-down cake!
I didn't make that food.
You promised me no witchcraft.
You said you were just going to be yourself but You didn't?
Well, who did?
I would say your prime suspect is Aunt Clara unless your mother's holding out on us.
- What?
- She isn't a witch too, is she?
Let's leave my mother out of this.
No matter what you say, Darrin, it was a delicious meal and she hardly ate a mouthful.
Now, what can I do to get her to like me?
Sam, let's just solve one problem at a time.
I'll have a little talk with Aunt Clara after dinner.
Now, Darrin.
If you hurt her feelings I'll never forgive you.
She was only trying to help.
Well, I'll just ask her to stop helping.
- Be tactful.
- Don't worry.
I'll tactfully tell her that the position of house witch is already filled.
Come in.
Am I disturbing anything, Aunt Clara?
Oh, not at all, not at all.
No, I'm just polishing my doorknobs.
It must be quite a job, keeping those clean.
Well, it keeps me out of the pool halls.
That was quite a dinner you whipped up.
Oh, I still know a trick or two.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Aunt Clara.
You see, my mother and father, they aren't used to witchcraft.
You see that?
Now to a doorknob collector, that's equivalent to the Hope Diamond.
It's not that we don't appreciate your trying to help.
Such a nice sparkle.
Yeah, I wouldn't have even brought it up at all except that my mother and father just don't understand.
Do you understand what I'm saying, Aunt Clara?
Oh, it's nice of you to look at my doorknob collection.
Not many young people care about that sort of thing nowadays.
Come on, bag.
We must go.
Did you talk to Aunt Clara?
You didn't upset her, did you?
- She didn't seem to be upset.
- Did she understand?
It's hard to tell with Aunt Clara.
I think I better go up and see her.
I thought I'd give you a hand with the dish Oh, you've already done them.
Isn't there anything I can do?
Nothing at all, Mom.
Sam has done it all.
You should get the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, Samantha.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Darrin, are you happy?
What?
Of course, Mom.
Now, if there is anything you want to tell me about, I'm always here.
I've never been happier in my life.
Any problem at all, no matter how large or how small.
Just because you're married doesn't mean you can't come to your mother.
Mom, I don't have any problems.
Well, that's all right.
If you don't want to tell me about it, that's fine with me, - I'd cut off my right arm - Phyllis, leave the boy alone.
Now, hasn't a mother the right to ask if her son is happy?
Who wouldn't be happy married to a dream like Samantha?
She's a lovely girl, all right.
Why've you been trying to find fault with her ever since we arrived?
- That's not true.
- I mean, what do you want?
She's beautiful, she's talented she's even-tempered and she's a great cook.
- I agree.
- Then there's no argument.
- Then there's no argument.
- All right!
If there's no argument, why are you yelling at each other?
- What'd you do to Aunt Clara?
- I didn't do anything.
You must've said something insulting, or she wouldn't have left.
- Sam, do we have to?
- Darrin, you promised to be tactful.
- Must we discuss this in front of them?
- Yes.
Aunt Clara is a guest in this house too.
You may not like it, but she's my family.
Really, Samantha.
There's no need to take it out on Darrin.
- Shut up, Phyllis.
I told you it's not my fault she left.
Yes, it is.
If you hadn't been annoyed Aunt Clara made the dinner none of this would've happened.
She cooked dinner?
Yes, she did.
You may as well know it right now, I'm not a very good cook.
You're not?
No, I'm not.
I can't make coq au vin or pineapple upside-down cake or any of those fancy dishes.
- Samantha.
- It's no use, Darrin.
I cannot pretend to be something I'm not.
And I won't stand here and see Aunt Clara hurt.
I don't blame you.
What did you say to that nice old lady?
- I didn't say any - You be quiet.
- Go on, dear.
- Well, that's just about it.
I wanted you to think I was the perfect wife for Darrin, and Aunt Clara thought she was helping me.
The fact is, I'm not very good at housekeeping yet.
If you like me any less for that, I'm sorry but you just have to accept me as I am, faults and all.
Samantha, you don't know how happy you've made me.
What are you crying about?
What do you men know about anything?
What's going on here?
I didn't want you to be perfect, dear.
Well then, why did you act as if you did?
Because I'm a silly old woman who was afraid she'd be pushed aside and forgotten.
And you seem so self-sufficient and so good at everything.
I just thought I wouldn't be needed anymore.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
- I'll go find Aunt Clara.
- She's at the bus station.
- How do you know?
- I asked her umbrella.
Good thinking, I'll be back in a few minutes.
Well, I hope he finds her.
You asked her what?
Oh, a family joke.
I just have a hunch she's there.
Maybe Aunt Clara is right.
You are a witch after all.
I am.
But don't spread it around.
It'll be our secret.
Oh, Darrin.
You don't really think that I bronzed your tennis racket, do you?
Of course not, Mom, I knew Pop was kidding.
However, I did bronze your shoes.
Your football shoes.
We're using them for bookends.
- Would you girls like a little magic?
- Frank, for heaven's sake.
We'll show you a little trick here.
Aunt Clara, take a card out of the deck.
Just any card, go on.
Take it out and then look at it, put it back in.
Don't let me see it now.
Let me see.
All right.
- You got it.
- Yep.
Put it back in, now.
Anywhere, just anywhere.
Right.
Alrighty now, let's see.
Your card is the It's funny.
It's always worked before.
You'll find it in your topcoat pocket.
Now, how did you do that?
I'm a witch.
Oh, well, now, I think I'll go for my little constitutional.
You mind if we walk along with you?
Walk?
Well, that might be nice for a change.
You know, the next time we come I must bring my sister Madge along.
She and Clara would have a ball, wouldn't they, Frank?
Oh, dear.
They really seem to have hit it off, haven't they?
They sure have.
And they think you're the greatest.
That's nice.
Well, it's as I said.
All you had to be was yourself.
You're right, darling.
Samantha.
You said I should be myself.
I take it all back.
Maybe my folks aren't ready for the real you yet.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
You can send me two pounds of onions a pound of butter a head of lettuce and 60 cans of wax beans.
Yes, that's right, 60 cans.
Bye-bye.
They're having a sale on wax beans.
- I see.
- You know, by buying 60 cans I save 3 cents a can.
- Wonderful.
And it also takes care of all your wax-bean buying for the next 15 or 16 years.
- Are you making fun of me?
- Of course not.
You know, there's a lot more to running a house than most people think.
Did you know that lemon juice takes out ink stains?
- No, I didn't.
- See that?
Honey, I think it's wonderful the way you've adjusted.
Bet there's not a witch in a thousand who'd do as well.
I love being a housewife.
You sure you won't get bored once the novelty has worn off?
How could I be bored being married to someone like you?
Lady, you've just talked yourself into dinner for two at the best restaurant in town.
I'll see you tonight.
I'm Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
- Has my husband arrived yet?
- Not yet, Mrs. Stephens.
Right this way, please.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
- Can I get you anything from the bar?
- Oh, no, thank you.
I'll wait.
Is there something I can do for you, beautiful?
Yes, you can go away.
I dig blonds with class.
Now, why don't you and I get to know each other a little bit better.
Please leave.
I'm expecting my husband any moment and he has a very violent temper.
- Excuse me.
- Hi, honey.
- This man been bothering you?
- It's nothing.
This little blond here tells me that you're a very tough guy.
This little blond happens to be my wife and if you don't - Darrin.
Darrin, he's Well, let's leave.
Darrin.
That's a pretty name for a tough guy.
Now, look, you.
I don't - Does that hurt, Darrin, baby?
- You let go of him.
This is just for openers, Darrin.
Why, you Come on, Darrin, let's leave.
Oh, my stars.
Breakfast ready, honey?
No.
No, just a minute, sweetheart.
Darrin?
Are you still mad at me?
Honey, I'm not mad at you.
I'm just disappointed.
I was only trying to help.
I know, sweetheart, and I appreciate it.
- But you're not supposed to.
- Why not?
When a man's wife is being annoyed by a drunk in a bar the man's the one who's supposed to do something about it.
- Well, you did, didn't you?
- Oh, sure.
I took a wild swing, and I missed.
You twitched your nose and knocked him cold.
Does it still hurt?
Darling, I just can't stand by and do nothing when you're in trouble.
You'd do the same for me if you could, wouldn't you?
Yeah, sure.
Let's pretend the whole thing never happened.
- Let's just forget about it.
- Okay.
Honey, where's the morning paper?
Morning paper?
Oh, never mind.
I see it.
Samantha!
Abner!
Something you wish to call my attention to, Gladys?
The Stephens.
They're fighting with each other.
You saw it on your private radar screen.
No.
No.
He He He Mr. Stephens is gonna be the next heavyweight champion.
That's wild, all right.
But not as wild as some of the things you've been dreaming up about them.
- Maybe you're getting better.
- All right, Mr. Know-lt-All.
Look, it's right here in the paper.
Mr. Stephens, wait a minute.
May I have your autograph?
- Mr. Kravitz.
You're kidding.
- You're a celebrity, Mr. Stephens.
Sign right here where it says "next heavyweight champ".
Me, living next door to the man who knocked out "Jolting" Joe Kovack.
- Can you imagine that?
- No.
I'm sure glad I got your autograph this morning while you can still write your name.
What does that mean?
You didn't see Kovack's fight with "No-Nose" Novotni?
No.
Excuse me, Mr. Kravitz.
- I have to get to the office.
- Sure.
Of course, they didn't start calling Novotni "No-Nose" until after the fight.
- Hi, Johnny.
- Good morning, Mr. Stephens.
- Are you okay?
- Sure.
Shouldn't I be?
After the Tomson-Kovack rematch Tomson had both shoulders in a cast for three months.
And he was lucky.
- Lucky?
- Yeah, it was a glancing blow.
- The next time you run into Kovack - Yeah?
be in your car.
- Mr. Stephens?
- Not right now, Barbara.
- But - And I don't want to be disturbed.
All right.
- Okay, but you'll get the chair for this.
- Easy, Mac.
- Stupid, here, just come to apologize.
- Yeah.
Apologize?
Well, he He certainly should apologize.
Annoying my wife and assaulting me and going Look, pal, I had a couple of shots, and, well I ain't used to it.
Most of the time, I'm in training.
See what I mean?
Now, about that assault bit, sport.
We got some witnesses and a picture.
Now, this picture shows my tiger out cold and you standing over him.
I still say I never saw the punch he hit me with.
Yeah, the whole thing was magic, like he did it with mirrors.
- As a matter of fact - Let's get down to business, right?
Now, I figure you and Joe meet at Dundee's Bar again and he apologizes to you in public.
- Oh, that won't be necessary.
- Shut up.
- The sooner, the better, is what I say.
So we'll make it at lunchtime today.
Now, I'll fix it so there'll be plenty of reporters and camera guys around.
- You dig?
- No.
Don't you know what that lucky punch of yours last night cost us?
A million bucks.
Maybe 2 million.
You knocked us right out of a title fight.
- I did?
Why?
- Because who's gonna pay to see us?
I mean, me, fight Tommy Carter, the champ after I've been KO'd by a square named Darrin.
- I got a good mind to - Shut up.
So at Dundee's place, Joe's gonna apologize like the clean-cut fella he is, only you ain't gonna accept his apology.
Sure, I will.
I'm a good sport.
Ask anybody.
No, Darrin.
You're a lousy sport.
You're gonna refuse to shake hands with him.
One thing is gonna lead to another you'll throw a couple of punches and Joe is gonna lay you out.
- Joe is gonna pull his punch, natch.
- Natch.
He's just gonna graze you, and you go down, and you stay down.
Are you suggesting that I take a dive?
I won't do it.
It's un-American.
So if Joe busts your jaw for real, you're a patriot?
- Can I kind of lean on him right now?
- Not now.
Later, maybe.
Darrin, I don't think you're in no position to dicker.
- May I think about it?
- Why not.
Take your time.
Take about 10 seconds.
I'm up here in the nursery, Mrs. Kravitz.
Okay.
- Hello there, Mrs. Stephens.
- Hi.
- What are you doing?
- It's a pony for Tabatha.
Isn't she a little too young to ride?
Abner says that if he were Mr. Stephens, he'd be hiding out.
- Oh, come on.
- I'm just telling you what Abner said.
He says Kovacks is gonna catch up with him and give it to him good.
Hello.
This is Mrs. Stephens.
Is my husband there?
Did anything unusual happen?
Did you say Dundee's?
No, no.
No message.
Thank you.
They're meeting for lunch.
It's an ambush.
You've got to warn him.
- I'll tell you, I'll babysit and you go.
Go.
- All right.
Tabatha's been fed, and I'm sure you'll have no problem.
Problems.
It'll be a pleasure.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, aren't you going to change before you go out?
Oh, of course.
What could I have been thinking of?
Goodbye.
Hey, ain't you what's-his-name?
The guy that creamed Joe Kovack?
You're confusing me with someone else.
Excuse me.
You're him.
You're the guy, all right.
Well, you don't look so tough to me.
Put them up.
Come on, put them up.
Come on.
Come on.
Hey, come on.
Fight.
You, I know I can lick.
- And I don't want no mistakes.
- Okay.
All right.
Well, I owe you an apology.
- Oh, yeah?
- No hard feelings?
Get lost.
Give me a double martini.
Look, friend, I'm trying to be a nice guy.
Beat it before I flatten you again.
Now, friend Don't call me "friend," you You louse!
All right, put them up.
Samantha.
Samantha.
Samantha!
Samantha!
Sam, you're supposed to be my wife, not my bodyguard.
Darrin, how was I supposed to know the whole thing was a fake?
What was I supposed to do?
Let him hit me.
You mean just stand around and look happy while he puts you in the hospital?
- Yes.
Well, I don't mean that.
He wasn't really going to hit me.
- You sure?
- I'm pretty sure.
I'm sorry.
I really did mess things up, didn't I?
I'll figure some way out of this, but you've gotta promise me one thing.
- Anything you say.
- Don't do it again.
I mean, if you see me squaring off with a locomotive, don't twitch.
Go read a book or something.
Understand?
Yes, sir.
In the future, let me fight my own battles.
- Okay.
Okay, I promise.
- Okay.
Abner.
Hey, Abner.
Abner, put that flute down and come and help me.
Help you what?
Help me put this box over there on the sofa.
- You got it?
- Yeah.
What have you got in here some of your icebox cookies?
I'll tell you in a minute.
Abner.
Abner, he did it again.
- Who did what?
- Mr. Stephens.
I just heard it on the car radio.
That boxer got snippy again, so Mr. Stephens hit him.
- Where?
- In the bar.
It took three seconds to knock him out cold.
The fight game isn't what it used to be.
Abner, what would you do if someone made a pass at me in a bar?
- I'd faint.
- No, I'm serious.
Now, supposing a man tried to kiss me, what would you do?
Put a dime in his tin cup, pat his Seeing Eye dog and go home.
- Now, what's in the box?
- Something for that stomach of yours.
- They have a sale of bicarbonate?
- You're out of shape, Abner.
I was born that way.
Well, anyway I decided that the one thing you needed in your life was a dumbbell.
So you married me.
Funny.
Very funny.
Put that flute down.
Doesn't it bother you that every time I go out I am fair game for any playboy that has a roving eye?
Gladys, if Richard Burton can live with it, so can I. That's not a good enough answer.
It's my responsibility to keep you healthy and fit.
I don't want to be healthy and fit.
I paid good money for this dumbbell and you're gonna be healthy and fit if it kills you.
Hi, Darrin.
- Would you mind explaining this?
- It's the morning newspaper.
I know it's the morning newspaper.
What I want explained is You mean there's more?
- Possibly in the afternoon newspaper.
- Possibly?
Probably.
I went to lunch at Dundee's today, and I met Kovack again.
And he dumped you right on the seat of your pants in front of a whole roomful of people.
Not exactly.
- There weren't a lot of people around?
- The bar was jammed.
There were reporters and photographers.
- They took a lot of pictures.
- Of what?
Of me dumping Kovack on the seat of his pants.
You don't believe me.
Frankly, no.
Darrin, remember when we used to skip lunch and work out together in the gym on Tuesdays and Thursdays?
Yeah.
You were on a health kick.
You developed a potbelly and Never mind about my potbelly.
The point is we used to put on the gloves and spar every now and then.
Sure, I remember, Larry.
We used to kid around a lot in those days.
Well, I had the impression then that I could take you any time I wanted to if we ever tried to mix seriously.
Sure you could, Larry.
Well, there's a clause in my contract where it says I am not allowed to beat up on my boss on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Fact is, I still think I can take you.
Talk about a case of arrested development.
Where you going, chicken?
To a saloon.
You meet a much more intelligent class of people in bars than you do in advertising agencies.
Potbelly!
Thanks, Harry.
We meet again.
Darrin Stephens, right?
No, I just look like him.
Actually, I'm Elroy Aspinwall, the well-known professional fly-caster.
Look, you can't keep running forever.
Why don't you and me just step outside and we'll see how tough you really are.
Okay.
Why don't you go out the back way and wait in the alley?
I'll be along as soon as I finish my drink.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- That's okay.
Hey, aren't you the guy that KO'd Kovack?
Look, I just came in for a nice, quiet drink.
I've been wanting to meet you.
You really creamed him, huh?
That thing with Kovack was an accident.
An accident?
Twice?
- Yes, twice.
Now, if you don't mind, l - Not so fast.
You know, I don't get it.
You don't look as if you could knock out my grandmother.
Well, let's just say I was lucky, and forget it.
I guess those stories about Kovack having a glass jaw are true.
Yeah, that's right, a glass jaw.
Now, do you mind if I sit down and finish my drink?
Sure.
Right after I've tried a little experiment.
- Experiment?
- Experiment.
I'm the prettiest, and I've got an iron jaw.
- So bust me one.
- What?
I mean it.
Give me your Sunday punch.
I'll bet you can't even make me blink.
Well, go on.
Give it your best, put it to the test and I'll put you to rest.
Now, look You laid him right out.
- But it was an accident.
- You know who that is?
No, and, frankly, I don't care as long as he's not another contender.
That's no contender.
That's Tommy Carter, the champ.
Sam.
Sam?
Sam, where are you?
Sam, where are you?
Who are you calling for?
She changed herself into someone else so that You!
You're Sam.
That's right.
- Sam, what did you do with Harry?
- Harry?
Harry went home.
Sam, I've just about had it.
Now, I'm warning you.
When we were married, didn't you promise to love, honour and obey?
Me?
Do you want to be my wife, or don't you?
Anything you say, mister.
Only, wouldn't you be just as happy if instead we got to be very good friends?
Here we go again.
I'm making the front page more often than the astronauts.
There you are, darling.
I swear to you, I came straight home after I left your office and I haven't been out of the house since.
Then you kept your promise.
I should've known you would.
You've got to promise me you'll stop getting in fights with world champions.
Honey, I didn't fight him, I fell on him.
My feet got all tangled up.
A likely story, tiger.
I will promise you one thing.
That was my last bout.
Then you're gonna retire, undefeated, as champion?
Depend on it.
I'll drink to that.
- Hi.
- I should've known it'd be you.
Darrin, I didn't come here to exchange insults.
You just want me to knock a chip off your shoulder.
Hi, Sam.
He's all over the papers again.
Tommy Carter came up to the office looking for you, champ.
- Oh, no.
- It's all right.
- I straightened out everything.
- You did?
You did?
Larry, you're a good man.
- The fact is, he's now working for us.
- For the agency?
Well, not exactly.
But he's agreed to appear at the Advertising Club's annual charity ball.
How about that, huh?
Larry, I've said it once, and I'll say it again you are the greatest salesman in the world.
What's he gonna do, say a few words?
Oh, better than that.
He's gonna box four rounds with an opponent of his choice.
With an opponent of his choice?
Larry, you didn't.
It was the only way I could get him, Sam.
Oh, great.
Don't worry, darling.
Everything is gonna be all right.
- It will?
- Sure.
I'll be in your corner.
Together, we'll be unbeatable.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
- Honey, I'm home.
- In here, dear.
I came home early to help you get ready for the folks.
- You?
- Never judge a gift by its wrappings.
Darrin.
Mother's going to join us for dinner.
Sam, my parents are coming over.
Now, that's what I call a gracious host.
Look, my parents are coming to town to see the baby for the first time.
I would like the evening to go smoothly.
Oh, it will, Darrin.
It will.
Mother's given her solemn oath to behave herself.
Haven't you, mother?
- Yes.
- She even bought Tabatha a present.
Look.
Isn't he cute?
May I see that for a minute?
All right, what does he do?
Suddenly turn into a real bear?
Sing the second act from La Traviata?
It sits on the shelf in a department store and people buy it.
It's not magic, just 8.95.
You swear there's nothing funny about this bear?
- Darrin, really.
- Sam, I've been burned too often.
Do you swear?
Well, if you're going to be boorish about it, yes.
All right.
Now, I thank you.
I think I'll go change for dinner.
The bear's all right.
It's the box that's magic.
- I was wondering - Tell me, Mrs. Stephens Oh, please, please.
Go right ahead.
Well, I was just wondering if you'd been over here very often since the baby was born.
Oh, just as often as I could.
There's so much work to do when there's a new baby in the house.
Do you think that's wise?
Wise, Mrs. Stephens?
Well, I mean, if it was me I'd worry about About meddling.
Well, I scarcely think Samantha would consider her own mother a meddler.
Grandpa and Grandma will be up in a little while to see you.
Yes, they will.
No, I would say she definitely takes after my side of the family.
Of course, it's so hard to tell at this age.
She's still so young.
Well, I can tell.
Those little expressions, those mannerisms.
Of course, I've seen her so often.
This will be your first time, won't it?
Tabatha is just waking up.
We'll run up and see her in a minute.
Mrs. Stephens, I was noticing Tabatha certainly has your eyes.
Oh, really?
Yes, yes.
The resemblance is quite remarkable.
Of course, at this age, her eyes are still changing.
Still, I would have thought those little flecks of gold- Where's Darrin?
Oh, he's out in the kitchen with his father.
Frank is probably talking his ear off about another one of those "I hate being retired" schemes.
Well, I'll go see if I can pry them loose.
Yes, do.
As I was saying, Samantha's grandmother had just those same little flecks of gold in her eyes too.
Really?
I've been telling Darrin about this fellow we met on the trip.
Seems that he's in the vending-machine game.
He's got this terrific idea.
Vending machines for cocktail lounges.
What do you think of it?
Press a button, zap, out comes a Manhattan.
- All he needs is a little capital.
- I don't think "I don't think it's such a terrific idea".
Your husband doesn't like it.
I don't see sense in retiring then spending your time figuring out how to go back to work.
You don't?
- Can't you just relax, take it easy?
- You're just like your mother.
"Now we can travel, Frank.
Just like we've always wanted, Frank".
What's wrong with that?
I'd like to meet the guy who ever said that travel was relaxing.
Two hours at a museum takes more out of me than a full day at the plant.
Right now you can travel into the living room with this.
- Then we can all relax.
- At your service, ma'am.
That is the fourth harebrained scheme he's told me about.
He's gonna take a crazy flier in something if somebody doesn't stop him.
- You stop him.
- Right now I've got to head off mother.
- Trouble?
Well, they're not exactly having a love feast.
Any bloodshed?
Not yet.
They're still at the kill-them-with-kindness stage.
You see, all you do is press this button and, zip, out comes a Tom Collins.
Zap, an Old Fashioned.
What do you think of it?
It's a little primitive, but it's interesting.
I'm all for laboursaving devices.
Phyllis, see, here's a woman with some imagination.
Yes.
Yes, one can see that from the way she dresses.
Oh, thank you.
Can I freshen anyone's drink?
Oh, Darrin.
I couldn't have done better myself.
Mrs. Stephens, have you tried the cheese crackers?
Oh, yes, yes, dear.
Absolutely delicious.
Perhaps a touch more lemon the next time.
I do envy you, Mrs. Stephens, for being so domestic.
Personally, I'm not much of a homemaker.
No, you're more of the woman-of-the-world type.
A career woman.
Got a great head for business.
Oh, Pop, can I refill your drink?
Yeah, just sweeten it up a little.
No ice, please.
Tell me your candid opinion.
If you were me, would you get mixed up in this vending machine deal?
- Mother?
- What?
Why don't you come and help me in the kitchen?
Oh, certainly, darling.
You know, I'm on sort of a sabbatical.
But I see no reason why an energetic man like you shouldn't get involved in whatever he wants.
Careful, dear.
Your back.
- Frank.
- Yes.
Where's the present we brought for Tabatha?
- It's right here.
- Oh, Mrs. Stephens.
There was really no need.
After all the things you've sent.
Well, if Mrs. Stephens wasn't able to see Tabatha it's very nice to send presents.
I just couldn't resist this.
Isn't he precious?
I think I hear Tabatha.
Excuse me.
Oh, let me go.
After all, what are grandparents for?
Darrin, dear, you seem a little nervous tonight.
Is there something the matter?
No.
No, I'm happy as a clam.
I'm just excited that you two are here.
Darrin?
Yes, sweetheart.
Those olives aren't pitted.
I thought they were kind of crunchy.
Rhebus, phoebus, abatha-Tabatha A dancing bear be When you hear the name Tabatha.
Tabatha.
He really is adorable, Mrs. Stephens.
I know Tabatha is going to love him.
Yep, she's awake.
I'll bring her down.
I really am concerned about Darrin.
I've never seen him so fidgety.
You're just imagining things.
He's probably got a lot on his mind.
He's fine.
Really.
You like the dancing bear.
All you had to do was get rid of the bear.
Could I help it if she wouldn't part with it?
Hello, sweetheart.
Did you have a nice nap?
What did you do to her?
I made her fall passionately in love with the teddy bear.
Well, just make her fall passionately out of love with the teddy bear.
Oh, don't be such a ninny.
She simply likes the toy.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
You'll have another bear in just a minute.
I'm sorry, but someday you'll understand.
Sam, why don't you bring the folks up?
All right, we'll get it.
What a shame she should be crying when you see her for the first time.
Don't be silly, dear.
Children are always cranky when they wake up.
Well, it proves she's got a good set of lungs.
Well, here she is in all her glory.
She's beautiful.
And I have just the thing for her, a little playmate.
A nice fuzzy teddy bear.
Did you see that, Mother?
We walk in and she stops crying.
That's quite a girl you've got there, Darrin, Samantha.
It looks like you're a little late with your teddy bear.
If I'd known she already had one.
Oh, Samantha, you should've told me.
Well, as a matter of fact Samantha was so busy fixing dinner she just forgot I brought it.
You brought it?
Well, I think that's terrific.
She'll be the only girl on the block with two teddy bears.
Make it three and you can change her name to Goldilocks.
- Mother.
- What, dear?
Why don't you run down and see if the roast is ready.
Certainly, darling.
I'm always glad to help out.
Mom, why don't you give her your bear?
Here you are, darling.
Now the teddy bear has a friend.
Looks like she's a one-bear girl.
Don't be silly.
She couldn't possibly know which is which.
See?
Can't tell the difference, huh?
Yes, sir.
She's quite a girl.
Well shall we all go downstairs and have a drink?
Yeah, yes.
You run along.
I'll be down in a moment.
Run along.
Come on, run.
- What's going on?
- I don't know.
All right, Tabatha, now we'll just Oh, no.
- Is anything wrong?
- Oh, no.
Will you look at that?
It's really nothing.
It's just a dancing bear.
Well, no wonder she liked this one.
It's incredible what they can do with children's toys nowadays, isn't it?
This bear is identical to the one I brought.
Look.
Look, the same brand.
- Mine doesn't dance.
- Let me have a look at that.
Well, actually it is the same bear, but I fooled around with it a little.
You know how I love to tinker, Pop.
- Yes.
Yes, I do.
- Well, it's really very simple.
You just invert the positive and the negative poles and that causes a reverse magnetic field.
And then that It's the old Mexican-jumping-bean principle.
The old Mexican-jumping-bean principle and, zap, the bear dances.
Son, did you really make that bear dance?
Old Mexican-jumping-bean principle.
- Well, that's terrific.
- It is?
This is just what I've been looking for.
Now you leave everything to me.
I'll find the manufacturer and arrange the financing.
Your office can handle the advertising campaign.
Son, we are going to make a million dollars selling dancing bears.
Pop, no.
Oh, Frank, for heaven's sake.
Phyllis, we've raised a genius.
If everything goes the way I think it will within six months we'll have Oscar the Dancing Bear in every crib in the country.
Samantha, do you mind if I go lie down for a few minutes?
I think I'm getting one of my sick headaches.
Here you are, Tabatha.
Pop, we can't go leaping into something like this without talking about it first.
You've been where?
Oh, no.
You better come over here this afternoon.
Pop.
Pop!
Don't you ever get tired?
- Your father?
- Yeah.
He's coming over this afternoon with a toy manufacturer.
How am I going to explain a dancing bear with nothing inside of it to make it dance?
Will you please sit still?
Darrin, I've tried all morning to unhex him.
Mother's the only one that can, and she won't show up.
You better try your mother again.
I'm going upstairs and try to remember that murder is against the law.
I'll say one thing.
You're a marvellous pacifier.
I'm glad to see one's gift is appreciated.
Hello, dear little one.
- Mother.
- Yes?
Take the spell off that bear.
Why, Samantha, what makes you think I did it?
Now, I hate to say this, but as long as that bear keeps dancing your granddaughter is off-limits.
I don't know where you learned to be so cruel.
It must be the mortal influence.
Well, very well.
Mudred, Milgrid, Polidor A dancing bear you'll be no more Thank you.
I hope you're satisfied.
Come on, sweetie.
You'll feel better after you've had your lunch.
She'll just have to learn to get along in a world without witchcraft.
Now, we'll get you upstairs, and nice and clean.
- Is the bear defused?
- Yes.
Mother finally saw it my way.
Hello, dear.
Hello, Samantha.
What's the matter with my baby?
I think she's a little disenchanted with her bear.
Well, maybe Grandmother has something to take its place.
- How about a nice friendly clown?
- Oh, that's darling.
Oh, aren't you precious?
Mom, you sure turned the trick.
Absolutely.
I was just gonna take her up for a bath.
- Would you like to do it?
- Oh, I'd love to, Samantha.
Thank you, dear.
- Come along, sweetie.
- Up you go.
You and the nice funny clown can have a nap.
Would you like that, dear?
I'll make some tea.
In the battle of the grandmothers, your mother is current leader.
Oscar, my boy.
You're about to make a comeback.
She doesn't like too many toys in her crib.
Well, she'll like this one.
Sleep well, little Tabatha.
Sorry to have brought you out here, Mr. Hockstedder but I'm afraid the toy just doesn't work anymore.
But, Darrin, last night it worked perfectly.
I know, Pop, but today, nothing.
I'll show you.
Honey, where's the bear?
It's in the dining Oh, well, I guess it's in Tabatha's room.
Excuse me.
Would you like some more coffee, Mr. Hockstedder?
- No, thank you.
- I just can't understand it.
It doesn't matter, Mr. Stephens.
In my line, you've got to follow up every crackpot Amateur invention.
You never know when somebody's going to come up with something.
But frankly, it almost always turns out this way.
Last night, that bear was a regular Nureyev.
Look, I've got a research department at my plant that would knock your eye out.
The Air Force develops a new missile and the next week we've got it in plastic.
One of my boys developed a ray gun, and the government bought it from us.
The way things are going the Hockstedder Wind-up and Battery-Driven Spaceman will be on the moon before the astronauts.
How could you expect a crackpot?
Amateur?
There we are.
Well, here he is.
See, just sits there.
Tabatha's sound asleep, honey.
That's a knockout.
Let me see this.
Son, you're a genius.
How did you fix it?
No wind-up key.
No batteries.
Remote control, huh?
I guess you might say that.
Excuse me.
Gentlemen I got where I am by not being afraid to make decisions.
Which one of you has the controlling interest?
Well, it's my son's invention, but I guess it's fifty-fifty.
Okay, I just made a decision.
I want 200,000 of these on the market as soon as my plant can turn them out.
- Name your terms.
- No.
What no?
I haven't even started bargaining yet.
I mean, there are innumerable difficulties.
Just tell me your problems and my research boys will iron them out.
Mr. Hockstedder, we have something else I think you might be interested in.
A toy baby.
Terrific.
Wind it up, please.
This is our daughter.
Coochie-coo, kid.
What other toys have you got?
Antimissile missile?
Death-ray gun?
By any chance have you got a germ-warfare kit?
No, not exactly.
Mother, Mrs. Stephens, would you come in here for a moment?
Now, Mr. Hockstedder, this is rather like the dancing bear.
My husband put in the mechanism just before you arrived.
What are you trying to do?
Get us out of this.
You've got a great future in toys.
I'm in for the same number of clowns.
How about it?
Oh, she's very attached to it.
Here you are, darling.
Have we got a deal or not?
Don't you think we should consult our parents first, dear?
Well, of course we've got a deal.
That's what Mr. Hockstedder's here for.
- How about you, Mrs. Stephens?
- Me?
It really is rather a wonderful opportunity.
But on the other hand, it's kind of a shame.
You see, now Tabatha is the only little girl with dancing toys.
If they're mass-produced, every baby will have one.
If I have any voice in this, I say no.
I have no intention of going into business.
I just wanted to bring home a toy that my granddaughter would like.
Oh, she does, Mom.
And the bear.
She's crazy about the bear too.
May I ask what's going on?
Mrs. Stephens, I'm truly touched.
To think that you'd give up all that money just for Tabatha.
Just a moment.
Just a moment.
If I'm not mistaken, it was I who brought Tabatha the teddy bear.
That makes me a partner too.
Am I not right, Samantha?
Well, yes.
In a way, Mother was really the driving force behind the whole deal.
And I will not allow crass commercialism to make my granddaughter just one of the crowd.
It's a tough decision.
What do you think, Pop?
I'm sorry, Hockstedder.
No deal.
You're all cracking up.
- My granddaughter is the most - My granddaughter is not about If Thomas Edison would've gotten mixed up with this crowd he'd be the only man with a light bulb in his house.
This is not the spirit that made our country great.
Excuse me.
We're really very sorry, Mr. Hockstedder.
Don't worry about it.
If he can make a dancing bear and an acrobatic clown my research staff can too.
- Like that: - I doubt it.
Sam, you've got to do something.
It's almost midnight.
Well, I don't know what.
If I leave them in the crib, she stays awake watching them.
If I put them away, she cries.
This could go on for hours.
Isn't there anything you can do?
Wait a minute.
I can't stop them from dancing when they're in the crib.
But maybe I could change the rhythm.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
"Happy Birthday, Darrin".
Darrin?
Who's that?
- The dearest man in the whole world.
- Oh, really, Samantha.
Save that for the icing on the cake.
You know you're fond of him.
You just can't bear to admit it.
He told me how the two of you cried the night Tabatha was born.
He cried.
Oh, I got a bit misty myself.
He also told me you gave him a fountain pen for a present.
He told you about that?
Oh, the snitch!
That was supposed to be a secret.
It would've been if while he was signing contracts the pen hadn't turned into a toad.
Oh, that's marvellous.
That's marvellous.
It's about time I gave Darwin another present.
No.
No, Mother.
No more tricks.
No, I wouldn't dream of it.
Now, what do you suppose he'd like?
Maybe it would be wise to let him decide.
Yes.
Very wise.
I'll give him something precious and see what use he makes of it.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Never mind.
Stars of lightning Suns of fire Heark en to the heart's desire Set your potent power free And grant this mortal wishes three I sure wish that elevator would hurry up.
- Morning, Betty.
- Morning, Mr. Stephens.
Betty, this may sound like a peculiar question but did you see a girl in a bikini walking around the building?
You're right.
It is a peculiar question.
- Why, did you?
- I think so.
Well, maybe she was posing for a layout.
- Is Mr. Tate in his office?
- No, he's still in Chicago.
- He is?
That's strange.
- That's what Mr. Turgeon said.
- Who's Mr. Turgeon?
- He's the man in Mr. Tate's office.
He says he won't budge till he sees him.
Maybe I better talk to him.
I feel you should know he told me that he always does business with Mr. Tate and he refuses to talk to anybody else.
Oh, excuse me.
McMann & Tate, good morning.
Oh, yes, Mr. Tate.
He's right here.
- I'll take it in my office.
- He'll take it in his office, Mr. Tate.
Hello, Larry.
Am I glad you're back.
There's - What?
- I said, fog.
You know, the stuff that creeps in on little cat feet.
Chicago's full of it.
I'm grounded.
Oh, boy, Larry, trouble.
There's a Mr. Turgeon here to see you.
Turgeon?
Don't tell me he's already in town?
He's in your office.
He's there to discuss renewing his contract.
Well, I'll just have to tell him you're stuck in Chicago.
No, he's only there for the day.
Unfortunately, I promised him faithfully I'd be there to meet him.
Larry, I don't understand.
What made you go to Chicago then?
Greed.
I smelled some new business here and flew down on an impulse.
Look, try and stall him.
I'll keep trying to get a plane.
- But, Larry - It's a matter of life or death, Darrin.
He's a weirdo.
We could blow the account just like that.
- Larry, what am I supposed to do?
- Think of something.
I'm counting on you, kid.
Thanks, kid.
Operator, I'd like to call New York.
Hello.
Larry, where are you?
Fog?
Are you sure?
There isn't any fog around here.
Louise, you're 1000 miles away.
I know where I am.
I'm a strong contender for Wallflower of the Year.
Congratulations.
I'm not exactly at a party.
Are you sure?
Louise, this fog is so thick, I'm not even sure I'm at the airport.
Even the pigeons are walking.
Yes.
Mr. Stephens, Mr. Turgeon is getting restless.
Mr. Tate is an hour late already.
He's gonna be a lot later than that.
Never mind, Betty.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, boy, I wish I were Larry Tate for one day.
Just for one day.
- Betty, you'd better tell Mr. Turgeon - Well, this is a surprise.
- Nice to see you back.
- Well, it's nice to be - Where have I been?
- How was Chicago, Mr. Tate?
Betty, would you put your glasses on, please?
I'm wearing my contacts, Mr. Tate.
Well, you A moustache.
- I have a moustache.
- Yes.
I know.
Betty have you got a mirror?
I am.
I am Larry Tate.
- Did you doubt it?
- Yes.
I mean, no.
- Excuse me.
- Where are you going, Mr. Tate?
Back to my office.
I mean, Mr. Stephens' office.
- But what about Mr. Turgeon?
- Tell him to wait in Mr. Tate's office.
I mean, my office.
Yes.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Larry.
How are you?
- Sam, this is not Larry.
This is - Larry!
How's the boy?
- Goodbye.
- Pardon?
I'll call you back.
- Important?
- Not exactly.
Your secretary told me you were still in Chicago.
Did she?
Oh, well, they're always goofing off with boyfriends or hairdressing appointments.
Well, old Larry Tate.
- Is it really you?
- You're not sure either?
Son of a gun!
You haven't changed a bit.
Well, neither have you.
Oh, come on.
You gotta be kidding.
Why, I put on about 100 pounds, and I lost most of my hair.
- Well, at first glance l - And I have grown a moustache.
It suits you, you know.
- It's just - How's Louise?
Oh, fine.
Louise is, you know I guess I told you Sandy is no longer with us.
She was a lovely woman.
Well, that's not funny, Lar.
Sandy was the best dog I ever owned.
I'm still an old bachelor, Lar.
You know that.
- I do?
- Oh, what's the matter?
- Your memory going?
- Well, l Oh, I know how it is.
Old workitis.
You get so wrapped up with work why, pretty soon you forget your own name.
Would it make you feel better if I told you I intend to renew our account?
You sure know my Achilles' heel.
- I'll tell Miss Stewart to get your file.
- Larry!
We're not gonna discuss it here.
- We're not?
- No, siree.
I got the cure for your old workitis.
Now, come on, friend.
Let's go.
Let's go.
Well, so much for business, Lar, huh?
That's good brandy, isn't it?
You keep looking after my interests as you have, and I'll be happy.
Oh, there's one more thing I wanted to ask you, Lar.
Excuse me.
- I've gotta make a phone call.
- Now, hold it, Lar.
Hold it.
Stay where you are.
You're an executive.
I'll have a waiter bring a phone over to the table.
Oh, waiter!
Oh, waiter!
- Oh, Joyce!
- Hi, Uncle Randolph.
Hi, dear.
Hi.
Come on right over here.
I want you to meet Larry Tate.
Larry, this is my niece, Joyce.
She's never been out of Philadelphia.
Nice to meet you.
Yes.
Now, Lar, Joyce is here for a reason.
I know you'll do a favour for an old buddy, huh?
This young lady is one of the finest advertising minds in the nation.
And I say that without prejudice.
I want you to talk to her for a while, feel her out.
Here, dear, sit right down.
There you are.
And listen to what she has to say.
Maybe you got a place for her on your team, huh?
I'd love to, Randolph, but There's nothing I'd like more Well, good, good.
A little nepotism never hurt anybody, did it?
Just great seeing you again, Lar.
I'll take the check, huh?
- Good luck, dear.
- Thanks, Uncle Randolph.
Mr. Tate, I have some ideas that will absolutely revolutionize the advertising business.
I have to make a phone call.
- Something wrong?
- No.
Well, isn't this cozy?
Louise, imagine meeting you here.
I come here quite often, Larry.
Or are you still in a fog?
Joyce, I'd like you to meet my wife, Mrs. Stephens.
Mrs Tate.
Joyce has one of the finest minds in the advertising business.
Really?
And I can just guess what she's advertising.
Well, I'll leave you two ladies.
The phone.
Hello.
Is that you, Sam?
Did you want to speak to me, dear?
- Hello.
- Sam?
It's me, Darrin.
Oh, Larry, you certainly have a peculiar sense of humour.
I haven't come to the funny part yet.
I've turned into Larry Tate.
- What?
- You heard me.
I'm Larry Tate.
- Well, now, how could that happen?
- I don't know, but it did.
And you can bet it didn't come from my side of the family.
Why are you whispering?
I'm at the Tate's.
And Louise is cooking my dinner.
She found out Joyce was the client's niece and now she's killing me with kindness.
You gotta get over here, Sam.
Joyce?
Niece?
I don't believe any of this.
All right.
I'll prove you're my wife.
You're a witch.
- I'm a what?
- A witch.
Did you call me, Larry?
No.
No, I was talking I'm on the phone, dear.
Sam, get over here and change me back.
You calm down, Darrin.
I'll see what I can do.
- Mother!
- Yes, dear.
Why has my husband turned into Larry Tate?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Perhaps he wanted to be his own boss.
- You had no right.
- Now, don't start that, Samantha.
If he wants to squander his wishes, there's little I can do.
- What wishes?
- I gave him a priceless gift.
The fact that he used it foolishly doesn't surprise me in the least.
You know, we ought to do this more often.
- What?
- Spend a quiet, cozy evening at home together, just the two of us.
I'll get rid of them, whoever it is.
- Hi.
- Samantha.
What brings you here?
Well - Darrin?
- Had to leave town.
Right, Samantha?
Yes, that's right.
He had to leave town, and I got lonely.
Good.
Glad you could come.
Isn't this a nice surprise, Louise?
- I'll set an extra place.
- Oh, don't go to any trouble.
Oh, it's no trouble at all.
Is it, Louise?
No, no trouble at all.
What are you staring at?
Is that really you in there, Darrin?
It's me all right.
How did I get into this?
Mother gave you three wishes for your birthday.
- Why didn't she tell me?
- She wanted it to be a surprise.
Well, she got her wish.
Oh, Sam, for Pete's sake, do something!
Okay.
Ready?
Stars of lightning Suns of fire - Dinner's ready.
- Oh, no!
- Larry.
- I'm sorry, Louise.
I'm just not myself today.
Oh, well, don't worry.
I'm sure you'll be back to normal before the evening's over.
I hope so.
Oh, my, it's getting late.
Larry, don't you think you ought to get some sleep?
Sleep?
No, no, I feel fine.
- Sam, another cup of coffee?
- Oh, I'd love it.
Louise, I've always said you make a great cup of coffee.
You never said that before in your life.
The only one who ever liked my coffee was Darrin.
Really?
Well, he certainly has good taste.
- I think I better check on the baby.
- Fine.
Larry, could you help me with a few things?
- What things?
- Things.
Pardon us, Samantha.
- Look, Larry, I like Samantha but - The baby's gone.
What are you talking about?
This is our bedroom.
- Oh, I thought we were going up - I just wanted to get you alone.
Larry, Samantha is staying and staying and staying.
She likes your coffee.
Besides, I like Samantha.
It's nice to have her around.
Well, I like her too, but I've had it for tonight.
I've been dropping hints, but she doesn't get them.
You've got to get into your pyjamas.
I beg your pardon.
Once she sees you're ready for bed, she'll go.
- I don't think so.
- Get into your pyjamas!
- Oh, come on, Larry!
- Wait!
What are you doing?
Please.
I'm old enough to undress myself.
Larry, in there.
Darrin.
What are you doing in Larry's pyjamas?
Never mind that, Sam.
Hurry!
Quick.
Turn me back while Louise is upstairs.
All right, all right.
Brace yourself.
Brace yourself.
Stars of lightning Suns of fire Please ignore this heart's desire Set your potent powers free Retract this mortal wishes three Well?
- When's it going to happen?
- Oh, I don't understand.
I'm sure that's the spell-breaker Mother gave me.
It's another trick of your mother's, Sam.
Help me.
Please.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
Good night, Samantha.
We don't want to keep you.
But we know you have a sitter problem.
Don't give it a thought, Louise.
I don't know why I'm so tired.
Oh, you go right ahead, Louise.
I'll make my own coffee.
- I'll give you a hand.
- Oh, thank you, Larry.
Good night, Samantha.
Get rid of her.
Good night, Larry.
Sam, what are we gonna do?
Do you remember exactly what you said or did just before it happened?
All I said was, " I wish I were Larry for the day".
- Then I went out to speak to my - That's it!
- What's it?
- You wanted to be Larry for a day.
It was like putting a time lock on the spell.
That's why I can't break it.
It'll be over at midnight.
What time is it now?
- Quarter of 12.
- Oh, 15 minutes.
- How can I get my clothes?
- Don't worry.
I'll whap them down soon as the time comes.
Well, why not whap them down now and let's get out of here.
- Oh, my stars.
- Now what?
It's Larry!
- We gotta get out of here.
- No, no, it's too late.
Louise!
Larry.
Where are you going?
Going?
I'm not going, I'm coming.
- Why aren't you in your pyjamas?
- I give up.
Why?
- I thought you were tired.
- Of course I'm tired.
The plane was delayed five hours.
I'll go get my bags.
Can you fix me a snack?
- What does this mean?
- Tell him you're a long-lost brother.
It isn't funny.
You.
What are you doing here?
I I live here.
You just went out to get the luggage.
And you were dressed.
It's cold outside.
- Aren't you supposed to be in bed?
- You asked me to fix you a snack.
I did?
- Larry, may I talk to you a minute?
- Couldn't we talk here?
It's cozy.
Excuse us, Samantha.
Larry, I demand an explanation.
I wish I could think of one.
You go on up to bed.
I'll get rid of Sam, and I'll explain the whole thing to you later.
No, I'll get rid of Samantha.
You go upstairs.
Why don't you go to bed, Louise.
It's been a long, confusing day.
I'll get rid of Samantha.
But right now, why don't you go up to bed.
Good night, Louise.
You're gonna shake my hand?
Oh, well Well Oh, for heaven sakes, Larry.
Kiss me good night.
Midnight.
The spell's over.
- Larry, what's the matter with you?
- Well, I Darrin?
Oh, hi, Larry.
We We weren't expecting you.
- Perhaps I should've sent a telegram.
- Larry, I can explain everything.
- Start with the pyjamas.
- Pyjamas?
Yes.
What are you doing in my pyjamas?
- That's going to be a little tricky.
- Take a stab at it.
- L - His clothes got wet.
- Really?
- Sure.
Really.
- It rained here?
- That's good.
May I interrupt?
I know it sounds strange, and I've said it before but I don't understand a thing that's going on.
- What's going on here?
- Sam.
You're asking me?
I come in here and what - Oh, dear.
Bad case, huh, Darrin?
- Worst I've ever seen.
Bad case of what?
Sleepwalking.
We came over to keep her company.
She got tired and went to bed, and we stayed to finish the dishes.
The next thing we knew, she was back down here still asleep, calling your name, and mistaking Darrin for you.
I guess I've been on the road too much.
Yes, she was very lonely.
I'll make a point of staying home more often.
I'm also making another resolution.
No more drinking when I'm flying.
Why?
You wouldn't believe what I thought was happening to me out front.
Yes, sir.
From now on, it's coffee, tea or milk.
Hi.
Just in the neighbourhood, thought you might like company for lunch.
How do you always know when I want to see you?
Oh, just call it witch's intuition.
How's your day?
Paradise compared to yesterday.
Have you thought about explaining things to Louise?
Don't have to.
She'll think she dreamed it.
That's using the old nose, Sam.
Darrin.
- I'm curious about something.
- What?
Your first two wishes, what were they?
Well, the first was to make an elevator speed up.
- And the second?
- Well, the second was Not important.
Anyway, I've already been granted my biggest wish.
- What's that?
- You.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Hello, Derwood, my boy.
Mother, I'm terribly busy.
Where's my grandchild?
Darrin's mother is taking care of her while I do this.
- While you do precisely what?
- Obviously, I'm making a dress.
But why all this rigmarole?
Oh, Samantha, have you forgotten everything I've ever taught you?
I haven't forgotten, but you know very well I prefer to do it this way.
When I'm through, I'll have the most enormous feeling of accomplishment.
- It's fun.
- Oh, it's pathetic.
It isn't.
Darrin and I have been invited to the home of the Glendons for dinner this evening.
He's a very important client.
Darrin wanted me to look my best.
Instead of spending the money, I thought I'd just whip this up.
- Think it'll look okay?
- Well, it depends.
Is it a hard-times party?
Well, I know it doesn't look the way they pictured it.
There's so many loose threads that I can't quite I did so want to make an impression.
Wear that, and you'll really make an impression.
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Goodbye?
Goodbye?
We had a date for lunch, which you've obviously forgotten.
Oh, I am sorry.
I did forget.
What do you want me to make?
Tracks.
I'm going to take you to lunch at a charming little French restaurant I've discovered.
Mother, I have to finish this dress before this evening.
I don't think I have time to go out.
Now, look, it'll take less time to eat out than it would to cook a meal yourself.
Oh, well.
All right, all right.
Is it far from here?
No, not really.
Actually, it's practically around the corner.
From the Rue de la Paix.
You'll love it.
Mother, this charming little French restaurant is in France.
Of course.
Where else would it be?
And you should be dressed accordingly.
Well, this is all very nice, Mother, but I'm going home.
Oh, darling, you'll be home in a half an hour.
And you did promise to have lunch with me.
- Not in Paris.
- You know what I always say?
- What?
- Lf you're going to have lunch have an excellent one.
Well, how did you like it?
Very much.
Thank you.
But now I think I better be getting home.
Samantha, why don't we go to Aubert's while we're here.
- The couturier?
- The most inspired dress designer in all of France.
And if I may say so, my dear child, you are sorely in need of inspiration.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
I promised Darrin I was gonna make that dress myself, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
How important is this Mr. Glendon to your husband?
- Very.
Why?
- Don't you think you should make every possible effort to please your husband and look your best?
Darling, I'm only thinking of you.
Having a peek at the work of a truly creative Paris designer can only help.
Don't you think so?
Oh, come on.
Come on, it'll only take five minutes.
Oh, well, all right.
All right, you've convinced me.
On to Aubert's.
Send whoever that is away, Brigette.
- Lf they are good customers?
- I plan the conquest of a nation.
Do not bother me with customers.
Besides, they may be spies.
Send them away.
At once.
Please ring them again, Samantha.
- They're obviously closed, Mother.
- Oh, nonsense, l I am sorry, but Aubert is not receiving.
Another day, perhaps.
Well!
After all that mortal money I've spent here.
Come on, darling, we'll just take a peek and then you can get on home to Darwin.
Darrin.
You're rather a beastly looking little man but I must say, these do have a certain flair.
Now, that's definitely your style.
Shall we take it along with us?
- Or would you rather have it sent?
- Neither, thank you.
You still insist on continuing with that dreary do-it-yourself project?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I think I'd better be getting home.
Very well, then, I'll go along with you as far as Bermuda.
Mr. Aubert!
Look at this.
Oh, well.
There you are, Tabatha, a Samantha Stephens original complete and ready to wear.
What do you think of it?
Marvellous.
Now you're an authority on high fashion.
Well, up to bed, young lady.
That's where you're going.
She said she'd let me know when they were ready to leave.
- Who?
- Mrs. Stephens.
- She asked me to babysit for them.
- She did?
Well, I offered to sit.
At first, she didn't wanna take advantage of me, but I insisted.
I thought it was the only neighbourly thing to do.
You mean a snoopy thing to do.
She's supposed to send up a smoke signal when she wants you?
Of course not.
She'll telephone.
And you can't hear the phone ring unless you're standing at that window with your spyglass.
Boy, is that a mess.
- She'll never get it finished in time.
- What?
The dress she's making.
She's supposed to wear it tonight when they have dinner with his big client.
How did you find all that out?
Well, I've got eyes, ears and a mouth like any other normal person, Abner.
Wanna bet?
Hi, honey.
I'm home.
- Like it?
- Yeah.
It's fine.
Fine.
But do you think you'll have it finished in time?
But it - You don't like it.
- No, no, sweetheart.
It's great.
It'll look swell on you.
- After it's finished.
- Right.
- Where's our daughter?
- Upstairs in her crib.
We have to be at the Glendons' at 8, so snap it up, huh?
Good.
Really?
Is that the dress you were working on?
I just made a few last-minute changes.
It sure looks a lot better on you than it did on that dummy.
Thanks.
Oh, that'll be Mrs. Kravitz.
I'll be right down, honey.
- Hi there, Mrs. Kravitz, come on in.
- Hi.
This really is so nice of you.
Now, Tabatha is asleep but I'm sure we'll be back before she wakes up.
That settles it.
I've got to get a new pair of opera glasses.
- I beg your pardon?
- Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Honey, we better step on it.
- Hi.
J.T. Glendon's a nut on punctuality.
- Well, have a good time.
- Thank you.
Oh, you look lovely, both of you.
Thank you, Mrs. Kravitz.
Night-night.
- Bye.
- Good night.
That's a marvellous cigar, Mr. Glendon.
Would you like to have one or two to take home?
No, thank you.
They're too hard to come by.
Have you been to Paris recently, Mrs. Stephens?
- Paris?
- Yes, I've been admiring your gown.
And I know you didn't buy it here.
Darn right, she didn't.
She made it herself.
- You're joking.
- No, I'm not.
You are talented, Mrs. Stephens.
I could've sworn that was a Paris original.
No, she whipped it up herself.
Only took a couple of days.
- Please, Darrin.
- Well, if you ever decide to open up a shop, I'll be your first customer.
I'll remember that.
I know it's an imposition, but do you think you might be able to design something for me?
She'd be glad to.
Wouldn't you, Sam?
I do believe my husband's getting a little carried away with family pride.
- I'm not that good.
- Sam, you're being too modest.
Yes, you obviously have a rare talent.
But not for dressmaking.
This one was just a fluke.
Well, I'd be willing to trust you.
Will you make a gown for me?
Well, I'd love to, but you see, my husband likes me to spend all my spare time with him.
Don't you, dear?
I'm sure Darrin is willing to make the sacrifice in this case, aren't you, boy?
Of course I am.
I'll even be willing to watch the baby while she's working.
- Then it's all settled.
I guess it is.
Doris, I'm green with envy.
That's my sister for you.
Whatever my wife wants, she wants too.
Sam?
Well, why not?
I'd be happy to make one for you too, Mrs. Granger.
You sure it wouldn't be too much trouble?
Oh, no.
No trouble at all.
Honey.
Honey.
Honey, I just couldn't say no.
You might have checked with me before you said yes.
- And what would you have said?
- No.
Sweetheart, you know how important the Glendon account is to the agency.
- I suppose so.
- Besides, when I said you'd do it Mr. Glendon gave me a whole box of these great cigars.
I don't smoke cigars.
Sam, I wouldn't have offered if making dresses didn't seem so easy for you.
Besides, you've only got yourself to blame.
You shouldn't be so talented.
In the future, I'll try not to be.
Oh, well, sure.
Sure.
Why not?
The more the merrier.
Okay, bye.
Well, my career as a dress designer is booming.
Gladys Kravitz wants me to make one for her.
- You could've said no.
- I didn't have the heart to turn her down.
Besides, she'd already gotten the material.
I'm sorry I got you into this.
You better run, or you'll be late for the office.
I'm not going to the office.
I'm driving out to the airport to meet a new client.
What time's the plane due?
I've got it written down here somewhere.
Excuse me.
There.
Aubert of Paris, arriving at Honey, I'm late.
I've gotta run.
By the great beard of Merlin!
Are you still on this seamstress kick?
Not "still," Mother, "again".
I got trapped into making dresses for Gladys Kravitz and the wife and sister of Darrin's client.
Samantha, would it be fair to say you are totally inept as a dressmaker?
No, it wouldn't be fair.
But it's true.
Then how can you hope to make three gowns the mortal way?
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to use witchcraft.
Samantha, it makes me very happy to hear you say that.
I was beginning to think I'd failed you as a mother.
Don't get carried away.
I'm only doing it because there's no other way out.
I don't understand.
If you're going to use witchcraft why are you bothering with all this?
In just a few moments, my customers are coming for their fitting.
I have to make it look like I'm doing things the normal way.
After they've left, I'll simply twitch up the other three originals that we saw at Aubert's.
Oh, that's my Samantha.
Mother.
Well, that just about does it.
Now that I have all your measurements I can start working with the material.
Well, what about my hips?
- What about them?
- You didn't measure them.
Well, I don't think we have to bother with that.
Don't you even jot down the measurements?
No.
I have a different way of working.
My measurements are easy to remember, 32-32-32.
Well, don't worry, Mrs. Kravitz, yours are burned into my memory.
That's funny, Abner says the same thing.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Darrin.
I won't keep you, sweetheart.
I just wanted to tell the ladies they're both invited to a cocktail party Friday, at which they can wear their gorgeous, new Samantha Stephens originals.
- Did you hear that?
- Yes.
Tell him we accept.
They accept.
What's the party for, Darrin?
I can't tell you any more about it.
It involves a new client, and it's very hush-hush.
You and the girls will get a big kick out of it.
All right, darling.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
Well, I don't have to keep you any longer, ladies.
As soon as your new dresses are ready, I'll send them over.
Oh, boy, I sure am looking forward to getting a new dress.
I just wish I had somewhere to wear it.
Here I'll be all dressed up and no place to go.
Well, see you Friday.
Oh, you mean you'd like me to come too?
Well, I'm sure Darrin would love for you to come.
I'll have to check our engagements, of course.
- You mean you might be busy?
- I wouldn't think of disappointing you.
Are you sure, Samantha, that you don't want us for a second fitting?
No, I have everything I need.
I just hope you don't give her my bust.
- I beg your pardon?
- Lf you got the measurements mixed.
Don't worry, I won't.
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Bye, Mrs. Stephens.
I just wondered what time for the cocktail What's the matter, Mrs. Kravitz?
How can you make three dresses in three seconds?
I just went out the door Then I went and suddenly saw You looking for something, Mrs. Kravitz?
Only my sanity, Mrs. Stephens.
Only my sanity.
Sanity.
It's some sort of a glamorous cocktail party.
I said we'd be glad to come if we're free.
If we're free?
We're free all the time.
What'll I do if my dress isn't ready in time?
So you'll wear the old dress.
Guess I'll have to go to the beauty parlour.
Boy, I'll say.
What are you doing anyway?
S.S. Sorrento.
That's the ship that sank.
How come you're making a model of it?
I'm sentimental.
It's the ship on which we had our honeymoon.
Oh, yeah.
And during all the time we were floating around in our life belts I kept thinking, "Somebody's trying to tell me something".
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.
- No more for me.
Thank you.
- Sam, you look particularly beautiful.
And you look particularly beautiful.
Also, particularly nervous.
- What's the matter?
- I'm about to make a speech.
- What about?
- Top secret.
But you'll know all about it in just a minute.
Excuse me.
How can Mrs. Stephens look so good while my wife looks so terrible, Mr. Glendon?
You must be a professional mind reader, Mr. Kravitz.
Friends, may I have your attention for a moment?
I can now satisfy your understandable curiosity.
This is a preview, or if you like, a dry run during which you will be afforded the privilege of an advance peek at the product my client will display to his prospective customers in the same room tomorrow morning.
Until now, it has been necessary to maintain secrecy in order to protect the character of my client's design.
But the time for secrecy has passed.
Therefore, it's with great pleasure that I introduce Aubert of Paris.
Today, I would like Have you any idea what your little lunch in Paris cost us?
Aubert fired the agency?
Fired us?
He's going to sue us for 5 million dollars.
- You'll wake up the baby.
- Five million dollars.
- That's ridiculous.
- It is?
What's my defence, the truth?
You do kind of have a problem, don't you?
He tried to introduce his line in the country before, and he failed.
This was his last chance.
The agency was to help put him over the top.
Darrin, I'm sorry.
You know the thing he was the most angry about?
The fact that he thought you'd given me all his top-secret designs?
No.
The fact only you looked good in his gowns and everybody else looked terrible.
Aubert seemed to think that I hunted the entire country to find the three women who would sabotage his gowns.
- Wait just a minute.
- What?
When I get through talking to Aubert, he won't sue the agency.
- He'll give you a bonus.
- When you get through What makes you think he'll talk to you?
Oh, he'll talk to me all right.
Sam, no more witchcraft.
That's what got me into this jam in the first place.
Don't worry, no witchcraft.
Maybe just a little.
Only if it's absolutely necessary.
Monsieur Aubert.
You!
How did you get in here?
- I have to talk to you.
- How did you get in here?
That doesn't matter.
I have to talk to you.
- I'm going to have you thrown out!
- Oh, dear.
Hello!
I hate to do this.
Now, in just a few moments, we're going to be very good friends.
And you are going to believe that the mysterious events of this afternoon were caused by my husband's attempt to dramatize the reason for your past failure to capture the American mass market.
The true reason for that failure is this: Your designs look great on half-starved fashion models.
But if you could come up with a design that looked good on the average American woman then you'd really have something.
- Got it?
- Got it!
The answer is the pear shape.
The shape most natural to most mature women.
Now, since there is nothing quite so luscious and quite so tempting as a ripe pear, why camouflage it?
Brilliant.
I bow to the master.
Yes, I see it all now.
I do.
It's too late.
The designs, the sketches, they're easy for a man of my genius.
But to have the proper models in the finished gowns by morning, it is not possible.
- Monsieur Aubert, I'll make you a deal.
- Yes.
You provide the designs and leave those humdrum, petty details to me.
Yes, but how can you possibly turn out a whole line of dresses overnight on your own?
- I won't be working alone.
My mother's going to help me.
I don't know.
Ladies and gentlemen, Aubert of Paris.
How could you explain to Aubert how you made the dresses so fast?
I simply told him: - Which means?
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.
Today, Aubert will lead the fashion world one giant step forward.
But rather than tell you about my revolutionary new concept I would prefer to show you.
Presenting my first creation for the average American woman as modelled by the average American woman.
Voilà.
Voilà.
And voilà.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
There you are, lady.
Time for your nap.
There you go.
It is a horse.
Now, now, take it easy.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
Well, now, that's better.
What's the trouble?
Funny.
I can't understand a word you're saying.
Well, let's make it easy on both of us.
There, that's better.
Better?
Honey, I've lost my two front feet.
I've nothing to brush the flies off me.
At least tell me what's on your mind.
I don't know who you are, but I'll tell you one thing.
You got a great way with animals.
How'd you do that?
I'm a witch, but don't spread it around.
If you don't give me away, I won't give you away.
Deal?
Deal.
Now, let's go over here and sit down, and you tell me your name.
Oh, my name is Dallyrand, by Rideler's End out of Cutler's Folly.
- A racehorse?
- Right.
You know, this is a crazy blanket.
Why don't you sit down.
I'm very glad that you're here.
Would you mind telling me the occasion for this visit?
Well, it goes something like this.
Ever hear of a horse called Adorable Diane?
- Yes, of course.
- Wouldn't you know it?
The glory-grabber.
Is she a friend of yours?
She's my oldest sister, and I hate her.
She never won a race on her own in her life.
Adorable Diane's won a lot of races.
Oh, yes, after I set them up for her.
We're always entered together.
She hangs back, and it's my job to set the pace.
- Do you mind?
- No, no, of course not.
Well, I gallop my heart out for the first half-mile or so to tire the other horses out and after they're all pooped, including yours truly up comes little Adorable Diane, and she wins.
Oh, I see.
And then back I go to the stable, panting and covered with sweat while my dear sister tangos into the winner's circle tossing her head and batting her big brown eyes at the photographers.
Oh, that's a shame.
Isn't there anything you can do about it?
I just did.
The trainer, Jack Spindler was taking me to the track to be an also-ran again and, well, I don't know, something just snapped inside of me.
I guess I'd reached the end of my tether.
- Do you understand?
- Perfectly.
Lady, I don't know what your pedigree is but you've got a great heart.
- What are you gonna do now?
- I don't know.
You acted on the spur of the moment?
Oh, spur.
Please don't mention that word.
I think if I just had a couple of days to settle down I could face being a loser again.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Oh, it's my trainer.
Oh, please don't give me away.
Just relax.
He won't recognize you.
Yes?
Have either of you ladies seen a horse?
Are you kidding?
Many times.
No, I mean around here.
In the last 10 to 20 minutes?
I was transporting her by trailer, and she broke loose.
Oh, my.
She sounds like a spirited animal.
Well, she comes from a good line, but she's not a winner.
Are you kidding?
Maybe you never gave her a chance, huh?
Maybe you never gave her her head and let her run her own race.
Did that ever occur to you?
You ever think of that?
Hold on, lady.
I'm not the owner.
I'm just the trainer.
Maybe you've discouraged her.
Maybe you've broken her heart.
Horses have feelings, you know.
Especially lady horses.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Don't you "whoa" at me.
Why don't you go into the kitchen and wait for me and I'll get this gentleman's name and address.
Does your friend live around here, ma'am?
No.
No, she's just visiting.
Seems to me I've met her somewhere before.
There's something familiar about her.
Anyway, the name of the horse is Dallyrand and you can reach me at this address.
Oh, fine.
- Thank you, Mr. Spindler.
- Thank you.
Come on in, Gus.
Well, this is it.
Hey, it's great, Darrin.
We like it, and so does the bank.
Maybe someday I'll be lucky enough to have a wife and a mortgage.
Come on, I want you to meet Samantha.
- Anyone home?
- In here.
Come on, Gus.
Hi.
I can't tell you how happy I am to meet you.
Darrin's given such a glowing description of you.
Well, I'm glad to meet you, tall, dark and two-legged.
Gus, no.
He means I don't live here.
I'm just a horse guest.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
Samantha, this is my old friend, Gus Walters.
Hiya, Gus.
I've been waiting to meet you.
Oh, this is a friend of mine.
Dally Dolly Rand.
Dolly Rand.
This is my husband, Darrin, and Gus Walters.
We've met.
Will you join me in some celery?
A carrot, Gus?
Oh, well, I don't Dolly's staying overnight.
Oh, fine, fine.
Why don't I fix us all a drink.
Good idea.
You all go in the living room, and I'll get out the ice.
Gus.
Okay, who is she, one of your mother's friends?
Tell me the truth, Sam.
Is she another witch?
No, she's not a witch.
Anything the matter?
These things should be nailed on.
I just threw a shoe.
Ice.
Well, Darrin's got this great campaign mapped out for me but now all I need is a couple of thousand dollars to put it into action.
A couple of thousand?
That ain't hay.
Gus certainly has come up with this great new idea for an office lamp.
Trouble is, I pushed my credit to the limit trying to get it into production and Could I have a little more meat, Samantha?
Oh, sure, Gus.
It's not only delicious, but when I get nervous like this, I eat like a horse.
Now, what kind of a crack is that?
Dolly's an animal lover.
Well, anyway, here I am with a better office lamp and nobody's gonna beat a path to my door if they don't know about it.
All you inventors ought to be required to take a course in practical finances.
Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't we all go to the track tomorrow and I'll show you how to pick the winners.
For a minute there, I thought you had a good idea.
Well, I wouldn't do this for most people but I kind of like Old Paint here and for a 2-dollar investment, he can make himself a bundle.
You?
You go to the track often?
I practically live there.
Really?
Do you follow the horses?
Always.
That's my trouble.
Well, I think it's a marvellous idea.
I'm all for it.
Honey, you can't be serious.
We could save ourselves a lot of trouble just by taking Gus' money and burning it.
That's only because you don't know the horses.
- And you do?
- Personally.
Darrin, really, what can I lose?
Just a few dollars and it's just about my only chance.
Scratch an inventor, and you'll find a gambler.
We've gotta be gamblers.
- Then it's all settled.
- Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
With Dolly as our leader, we can't lose.
- Coffee, anybody?
Excuse me.
- Black for me.
Never mind the coffee, I'll just take the sugar.
In lumps, if you've got it.
- I'll help you, honey.
- I don't need any help.
I'll help you.
I wanna talk to you.
- When?
- Now.
I have a feeling there's something you're not telling me about that lady.
- You do?
- I'm right, huh?
- There's something fishy about her.
- No.
Not fishy exactly.
- Horsy.
- Horsy?
Like, "Giddyup, horsy"?
Of course.
She's a horse, right?
Yes, that's right.
And you should see her.
She's beautiful.
- Her name is Dallyrand, and she's - She's a horse?
Yes.
A "horse" horse?
A racehorse horse.
You mean we've been chatting and having dinner with a?
You mean you turned a horse?
You turned a horse?
You mean, with a mane and a tail?
Oh, Sam, you did it again.
Darrin, I've never turned a horse into a person before.
- What kind of an excuse is that?
- Look, I know how you feel.
But when you've heard her story, you'll understand.
- Wanna bet?
- No.
But I think Gus should.
He needs the money.
And when Dolly says she knows horses she means she really knows horses.
But the fact remains that right now one of my best friends is sitting out in the living room talking to a horse.
Darrin, don't you think you're being just a little bit short-sighted?
I mean, look at it this way.
How many people have the opportunity of really getting to know a horse?
Well, I mean, you might kick yourself for the rest of your life if you didn't take advantage of this opportunity.
You've got to be kidding.
Well, then think about Gus.
He's 35 years old, and he's worked 10 years on his invention.
This may be his only chance to get enough money to put it on the market.
You think I'm being selfish?
Oh, Darrin, it's only for one day, and what harm can it do?
Please.
I don't know, Sam.
How can we be sure that Dolly's tips are sure-fire?
Darrin you're getting it straight from the horse's mouth.
Good night.
That was a great dinner.
Thanks, Gus.
And Dolly, I can't tell you how excited I am about tomorrow.
We'll pick you up at the motel.
I'll probably be up all night studying the racing form.
Oh, forget it.
That's just for people.
Well, good night.
Now, Darrin, don't worry about Gus and his money.
Oh, I don't mean to suggest the races are fixed but I do happen to know a little more than your usual bettors.
Relax, Dolly.
Relax.
He knows.
I told him you're a horse.
Oh, is that why you were so quiet?
I'm sorry, Dolly, it's just that Well, I never chatted with a horse before.
I mean I don't know what horses talk about.
Oh, the same things people talk about: The weather, working conditions, the usual track gossip.
Like which horse is gonna win the race?
No.
Remember, we're all nobility.
Arabian blood and all that sort of jazz.
We horses are out there to win.
That's nice to know.
That's my life's dream.
There's at least one great race left in this old bangtail.
I'd love to see myself in that winner's circle just once.
Oh, I tell you, the way I feel right now l'd like to sit down and have myself a good long whinny.
Dolly, that's just because you're tired.
You need a rest.
You've had a hard day.
Maybe you're right.
Where's the barn?
- I'll show you to the guest room.
- Just one race.
Just one race before I go to the great pasture in the sky.
You just had a conversation with a horse.
You've definitely flipped.
The horses are approaching the starting gate.
Hey, Samantha, guess who's still entered in the sixth race.
- Dallyrand.
- Yep, he hasn't scratched me Her yet.
Hey, Adorable Diane's in that race.
I've heard of her.
See?
See?
What did I tell you?
See?
See?
Dolly, just relax.
Try and enjoy yourself.
Dolly, suppose we go down to the paddock and look over the horses.
- You can pick me a winner.
- Oh, the paddock's for peasants.
Let's go to the stables, and I'll talk to the horses.
This is Diamond Turkey.
Nice, huh?
He goes in the fourth.
- Doesn't look too good to me.
- Me neither.
Not so loud.
You'll hurt his feelings.
You can't always judge a horse by his appearance.
Right, Dolly?
Well, you ought to know.
Hey, Diamond Turkey, how does it look for this race?
Oh, thanks, old buddy.
Come on.
Hey Diamond Turkey's a long shot.
Are you sure you're sure?
Oh, For heaven's sakes, get up and go to the window and give the man your money.
Go ahead, Gus.
What did Diamond Turkey say?
It's his birthday, and the other horses are going to let him win.
Isn't that nice?
I thought these races were on the level.
Well, sure, but we run a benefit once in a while.
They're turning for home.
It's Invincible Irma in front by three lengths.
Beautiful Pride is second, Dasher's third and Diamond Turk ey on the outside.
Here comes Diamond Turk ey on the outside.
It's now Diamond Turk ey taking the lead into the stretch by two and a half lengths.
Invincible Irma is second.
And Diamond Turk ey wins it all by himself.
He won!
He won!
- Dolly, you're a real horse.
- Player.
- Player.
- Happy birthday!
Hey, Romping Roger.
Sure?
Well, does he look good today?
Romping Roger, number five.
He'll romp home.
What is this, a wedding or an anniversary or something?
No, he just told me he's hot today.
Look.
Money.
Isn't that beautiful?
Put half in your pocket and the rest on number five's nose.
Anything you say, Dolly.
You're one of the greats.
How do you like living on the other side of the track?
You know something?
I'd have to train a while, but I could get to like it.
They're turning for home, and Romping Roger on the rail in front.
Now it's My Fav orite Martian on the outside.
Through the stretch, it's Romping Roger on the rail in front ahead.
On the outside, Fav orite Martian driving hard.
It's Fav orite Martian on the rail, with Romping Roger ahead.
It's Fav orite Martian.
Fav orite Martian ahead on the line.
Romping Roger is second.
What's that mean?
What's that mean?
Come on, Dolly.
Oh, I should've known it.
That plug always talks a big race.
Look, here he comes now with a whole mouthful of excuses.
Benedict Arnold!
Hey, take it easy.
- Oh, I beg your - Watch it, will you?
- It's you.
- Oh, hi, Mr. Spindler.
- Hello.
- Did you find your horse?
No, I'm still looking for her.
I have no idea where she is.
Well, I'm on Dallyrand's side.
I don't blame her for not coming back, the way you felt about her.
Now, just a minute.
I happen to love that little horse.
- You do?
- Okay, so she wasn't a winner but I liked her personality.
Anyway, I sure could use her right now.
I had to scratch Adorable Diane.
I don't have an entry for the sixth race.
You scratched Adorable Diane?
That little old showboat?
Yep.
She came up lame this morning.
Well, I sure am sorry to hear about that.
Well, that's what makes horse races.
Well, thank you for the philosophy.
The only thing that can help me right now is Dallyrand.
Dallyrand is not a thing.
Dolly, can I speak to you for a moment?
- Yeah, but take it easy on my fetlock.
- Oh, sorry.
See you later, Mr. Spindler.
Yeah.
- This is your big chance.
- Oh, yeah.
I know I could beat that whole pack in the sixth race, but not on two legs.
- Oh, Sam, I'm a born loser.
- You're still entered.
- You haven't been scratched yet.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- All you have to do is show up as your real self.
- Yeah, you're right.
You're right.
Okay, let me have it.
Oh, hold it.
Tell that nice Gus Walters to bet everything he's got on me in the sixth.
- Remember, I'm number one.
- I will.
I'm gonna miss you.
It's been nice knowing you.
Yeah, me too, Sam.
Well, thanks for everything.
Okay, fire away.
There you are, Dolly.
Okay, on your way, and good luck.
Dallyrand, baby.
Where did you come from?
You look in great shape.
We still have time.
Come on.
The horses are approaching the starting gate.
But it's crazy.
Dallyrand hasn't won a race in years.
No, sir.
I'm keeping the money I have left.
Gus, you can't.
This is it.
Dolly said to bet everything on that horse.
Look, Dolly's not infallible.
Her last tip didn't pay off.
Where is Dolly anyway?
She was called away on a family emergency.
- Family emergency?
- Her sister hurt herself.
Gus, please.
Bet on number one, please.
Look at the odds.
Ninety-nine to one, Darrin.
Nothing doing.
Gus, Dolly said if you never bet on another horse in your life, bet on her.
I mean Dallyrand.
Look, Gus, if you won't take a sensible recommendation, then take a silly one.
Dolly Rand.
Dallyrand.
Get it?
It's a great hunch bet.
Now you're making sense.
It is now post time.
- Well, I did it.
- Good boy, Gus.
The flag is up.
There they go.
Fantasy is drawing to the front.
Big Helen is second - Come on, Dolly.
- Why did I do it?
Why'd I let you talk me into it?
Will you stop?
You're beginning to make me nervous.
Come on, Dolly.
Passing the stands the first time, it's Big Helen in front by a head.
Knows Nothing is second on the outside, two and a half lengths.
Spanish Don is third, Montique is fourth - Come on, Dallyrand.
- Oh, I know you can do it.
- Around the clubhouse turn - Come on, Dallyrand!
- Where is she?
- She's running last.
- She's running last.
- Montique is fourth.
Dallyrand is trailing.
Come on, Dolly.
Come on, Dolly.
- Come on.
- Might as well tear these up.
- Gus, wait until after the race.
- Come on, Dolly.
Tell me when it's over.
I can't bear to look.
- Come on, old girl.
- I know she can do it.
Pioneer and Latk e and Dallyrand.
- Come on, come on.
Come on, girl.
- Come on.
- By one length, and now Dallyrand coming on the outside.
- There goes Dallyrand.
- Look at her move!
Knows Nothing in front by one length.
Montique is second and Dallyrand on the rail.
Dallyrand passing Orchards on the inside.
She's passing them all.
I can't stand it.
I can't bear to look.
Around the turn, it's Knows Nothing in front three quarters of a length.
Venture Out is second a length, Montique is third.
And Dallyrand on the rail turning into the stretch.
It's Knows Nothing in front one length, Venture Out is second.
And Dallyrand on the inside.
Here comes Dallyrand.
- Come on, Dolly.
- Come on, girl.
Venture Out in second, Spanish Don, Dallyrand on the rail.
- Move!
Move!
- Come on, Dolly.
Dallyrand on the rail.
Venture Out is third.
It's Knows Nothing in front.
And Dallyrand on the rail.
Here comes Dallyrand!
It's Dallyrand taking the lead!
It's Dallyrand in front!
Here she comes, she's gonna make it!
And Dallyrand wins it!
She won.
She won it!
She won it!
That Dolly can sure pick a winner!
It takes one to know one.
Congratulations, Mr. Spindler.
You betcha.
A great day for Towner's Stables.
You got yourself a real champion there.
You know it.
Say, your friend was absolutely right.
She's got a lot of horse sense.
I'll never hold her back again.
All she needed was a chance.
Will you look at that.
You got a great horse there.
She's almost human.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Hello?
Hi, Sally.
I was wondering where you were.
What?
Hang on just a minute, will you?
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I know you're hungry.
I'll feed you in a minute.
Hello?
Yes, you'll have to speak a little louder.
The baby's crying.
You can't?
Oh, Sally, I was depending on you.
Yes.
Well, I am sorry.
How about your sister?
Yes, I understand.
I hope you both feel better soon.
Bye-bye.
Where did you get that bottle?
Really, Samantha.
Where do you think she got it?
Oh, well, thank goodness.
For one terrible moment, I thought maybe Tabatha had Well, you never know.
Thank you.
Well, that's the last of them.
I've tried every babysitter I know.
I have a lunch date with Darrin and a very important client who insists on meeting everybody's wives.
If you really wanna go out, why don't you toddle off.
I'll stay here with Tabatha.
No, Mother.
I'd better not.
Thank you for offering, though.
What do you mean, you'd better not?
You've never stayed with Tabatha before.
Well, although this may come as a surprise, Samantha l'm not a complete stranger to babies.
You, as I recall, were once one yourself.
Don't you trust me, Samantha?
Of course I do.
- Doesn't Dagwood trust me?
- Well Oh, that presumptuous mortal.
Refusing to let me babysit with my own flesh and blood.
All right, Mother.
All right.
I'm sorry.
Of course you can stay.
Marvellous.
Do tell Dorian.
It's sure to ruin his lunch.
It's Darian Dor Darrin.
And I'll do nothing of the kind.
Now, Mother, promise me.
No funny business.
Witch's honour.
I promise, angel.
That's it.
That's a nice little girl.
And the beautiful, charming, kindly witch said to the nasty old Snow White: "Here's a lovely apple".
Don't kick, darling.
Now, listen we're trying to make you much more comfortable.
That's a girl.
Come Come in.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, the most remarkable thing happened.
I was just feeding little Edgar, the sweetums and you know what he did?
He grabbed the spoon It's you.
I thought Mrs. Stephens was here.
Well, Samantha isn't here.
Mrs. Kravitz do you know how to change a diaper?
I was just leaving.
What an adorable baby.
- I'll hold him while you're - Oh, he doesn't like to be held.
Well, then just set the little darling right here, and I'll watch him.
Well, he doesn't like to be touched either.
Very well, just as you say.
Hello, cutie.
Is Auntie Gladys gonna change you, huh?
I suppose you're wondering why I came in with a baby.
- No.
- Edgar is Edna's child.
Edna is my sister.
Edgar was born the very same week as Tabatha.
But they're completely different.
How nice, considering he's a boy.
Oh, no, I mean really different.
Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
Edgar is much more advanced.
Aren't you?
Aren't you, you little Einstein, you?
You see, my sister's husband is a CPA and you know how smart they are.
So naturally, Edgar is much farther along than other babies his own age.
Take Tabatha.
Edgar was crawling almost a week before I pricked myself.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Yes, but I wasn't even near a pin.
I'd finished.
Don't you worry, sweetums.
You'll clench your fist and you'll gurgle and laugh and eat with a spoon just like Edgar.
Now that Auntie Gladys has made you all comfy-womfy maybe nice old Granny would give you some milky-wilky, huh?
No, thank you, Mrs. Kravitz.
I don't care for any.
- She talked.
- So she did.
The baby talked.
Abner, I tell you, that baby talked.
I heard it with my own ears.
You mean you let her get a word in?
I asked it if it wanted some milk.
And she said, "No, thank you.
I've just eaten".
So?
What's so remarkable about that?
The kid wasn't hungry.
Abner, infants don't talk!
- Even Edgar doesn't talk.
- You make up for him.
Abner, I'm telling you, I heard that little baby, Tabatha, talk.
Now do you believe me or not?
Why shouldn't I believe you?
For a year now, you've been telling me there's funny things going on there.
Once, you saw people flying.
Then you saw pictures hanging themselves on the walls.
Now you tell me an infant can talk.
Know something?
You're improving.
Come on.
We can sit over here.
Yes, indeed.
Yes?
Samantha?
Fine, fine.
Did you have a nice lunch?
No.
No trouble.
No calls.
Yes, she's right here in my arms looking so bright-eyed you'd think she was about to talk.
Oh, no, no, dear.
Take your time.
No rush.
Bye-bye.
There.
Yes, that was your mommy.
Yes, I'm going to tell you another nice story about two naughty little children called Hansel and Gretel.
Yes.
Of course, I'm going to tell you the truth about Hansel and Gretel not any of those old falsehoods they've been spreading for years.
Now, there.
Are you comfortable?
Yes.
The book.
Now, here we are.
Let's see if we can find the story.
Yes, here it is.
Now, "Once upon a time a nice, kindly witch lived in a gingerbread house in the forest.
She wasn't bothering anyone or causing any harm".
You understand that, Tabatha.
"Well, unfortunately, one day, two nasty little hooligans called Hansel and Gretel found the gingerbread house.
Well, without so much as a by-your-leave the two little gluttons broke off her window ledge and ate it".
Now, what do you think of that?
Yes.
"Well, naturally, the nice witch was concerned".
I mean, who likes vandalism?
Mr. Stephens!
Mr. Stephens, wait.
- Mr. Stephens.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
I just wanted to congratulate you on Tabatha.
- What about Tabatha?
- The way she talks and everything.
Oh, it's wonderful.
A genius on my very own block.
- Tabatha talked?
- Why, yes.
I heard her.
She said, " No, thank you, Mrs. Kravitz.
I won't have any".
She meant milk.
I had suggested that she have some milk.
Hello, Tabatha.
I'm your daddy.
Do you have anything to say to Daddy?
Is there anything you'd like?
Just tell Daddy, and I'll get it for you.
I imagine she'd like her dinner.
It's already in the Let her say it herself.
Darrin, are you all right?
Fine.
Just fine for a man who's just learned his infant daughter can talk.
Tabatha?
Talk?
Mrs. Kravitz told me about it how she said, " No, thank you.
I don't care for any milk".
- Mrs. Kravitz?
- No, Tabatha!
- You mean you didn't hear it?
- No, I didn't.
It must've happened during lunch, when the babysitter was here.
- Mother!
- What mother?
Your mother.
- Sam!
- Well, Darrin the babysitter got the flu.
I couldn't get anyone else.
I didn't wanna break our lunch date.
- Well, it was the only thing to do.
- Honey, you didn't.
You didn't leave Tabatha alone with that broom jockey!
Darrin, she is my mother.
She got her feelings hurt when I refused.
She promised she wouldn't do anything.
Promises or no, you don't leave a four-time loser with an open safe!
Can you get her here?
That won't be necessary.
Broom jockey, am I?
Mother, you promised.
Truly, darling, I just couldn't help myself.
Couldn't help yourself?
Is that your excuse?
!
Darrin, Darrin, just give her a chance to explain.
Mother, you come down here.
That very foolish woman and her very advanced nephew just got on my nerves so I put a few simple words in the baby's mouth.
Oh, it was more than human flesh could bear.
- You're not human!
- Darrin.
- True.
- Mother.
How dare you play stupid, childish tricks on an innocent baby?
- Mother.
Darrin.
- There's no need to shout.
- You'll disturb the baby.
- The baby?
You couldn't care less about the baby.
Now, can't we just discuss this like adults?
That baby, my granddaughter was being insulted.
She was made to sound like a dim-witted lump.
- So what?
!
- Darrin!
All that's important is that she's a normal, healthy, happy baby.
- There.
She isn't happy anymore.
- There, you see.
- You see, you made the baby cry.
- I'm entitled!
I'm her father.
And from now on, you keep your conjuring mitts off of her!
Don't go away.
I'm not finished.
That's where you're wrong.
You're all finished.
Mother, don't you dare.
That's right.
That's right.
Not in front of the baby.
This the house with the talking baby?
- This is it.
Their name is Stephens.
- Oh, no.
What's the matter, Mrs. Kravitz?
You can't keep a thing like this to yourself.
A thing like this belongs to the world.
Daily Mail, ma'am.
We got a call from some lady, says you got a talking baby.
Yes, that was me, Mrs. Kravitz with a K. R-A-V-l-T-Z.
That's her.
She's the one.
Hello, Tabatha.
These are the gentlemen of the press.
Mrs. Kravitz, I'm sure you've made a mistake.
Well, I know what I heard.
Gentlemen, I'm sorry that you've been brought here on a wild-goose chase Yes, I don't know what Mrs. Kravitz told you.
The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth.
But the baby didn't talk.
Gurgled, maybe, or Or maybe there was a radio playing somewhere and that's what she heard.
Radio.
Anyway, you can see for yourself, she's just an infant.
- She doesn't even say "Mama" yet.
- No.
- Well, we figured as much.
- But we had to check it out.
Hey, hey!
Wait a minute.
She heard it.
- She can tell you.
- My mother-in-law didn't hear a thing.
Oh, are you referring to me, the broom jockey?
- What about it, lady?
- Besides, she makes up things.
You can't believe a thing she says.
On the contrary, my grandmother always tells the truth.
Did you hear what I heard?
How about a statement for the press, honey?
Not tonight, gentlemen.
I haven't had my dinner.
- Okay.
Hold it.
- We'll see you tomorrow.
Oh, what a story.
So long.
Look for yourselves in the morning edition.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait for me!
Wait till I tell you how these people fly in and out Darrin, you can push Mother just so far.
Sam!
Sam!
Samantha - Maybe nobody will notice.
- Not notice?
This is the kind of thing people eat up.
We're in for it.
Darrin, I'm sure people have much too much to do to bother about a silly thing like this.
Good morning, Tabatha.
Ready to give us that statement now?
When was the first time she talked?
Is that the one?
Looks like any ordinary baby.
Some ordinary.
She already talks better than you.
Itchy-kitchy-koo, Tabby.
Who do you like in the National League pennant?
- I'm sorry.
This has all been a mistake.
- How do you like that?
People have a smart baby, and all of a sudden they get snooty.
Oh, my stars.
No.
Definitely, emphatically, categorically no!
But, Darrin, it's perfect!
Can't you see it out of her own mouth?
"I like Nasely's Baby Food.
It's got the taste and texture that's right".
Then we dub in a baby chorus with Tabatha singing the Nasely jingle.
Larry, for the last time, she can't talk.
Oh, come on, buddy boy.
Let's not carry this modest-parent thing too far.
- There were witnesses.
- She won't do it!
- Aha!
- What "aha"?
You said "won't," not "can't".
What are you doing?
To heck with you.
I'll ask Tabatha.
- Who is it?
- Mailman.
Daily Mail, ma'am.
What does Tabatha think of the American income tax structure?
I don't think she's too crazy about it.
- Sam.
- Hi.
Where'd you come from?
I snuck in the back way to avoid the crush.
This is terrible.
They haven't let me alone all day.
I know.
Me too.
Larry wants Tabatha to give testimonials for baby food.
Oh, marvellous.
I tried to get Mother, but she won't come.
- I think she's still mad.
- She's mad?
I've been at it all day.
Your turn.
Hello?
Yes, this is Darrin Stephens.
What?
You want to rent her?
For six weeks, to run her through a series of tests.
Why don't you guys go back to finding a cure for the common cold.
Who was that?
The Mayo Clinic.
Tonight, all America is agog over the report that little Tabatha Stephens an infant girl no longer than my arm speaks the King's English as well as you or I do.
Reliable sources report that the Stephens have been contacted by the Hollywood Palace TV show.
- Sam?
- They wanted her to emcee but I turned them down.
And this evening, TASS, the Russian news agency announced that in Moscow, a baby two weeks younger than Tabatha speaks perfect Russian.
- Figures.
- Meantime, in Washington - Who is it?
- Mailman.
You tried that before.
U.S. Mail.
Special delivery.
You better be.
It's for Tabatha.
Got to deliver it personally.
She's in conference.
Sure would like to see that talking baby.
Sorry.
- Who is it for?
- Oh, dear.
Tabatha.
It's from Harvard University!
They're offering her a scholarship.
Harvard University?
But she's a girl.
They'll make an exception.
Darrin, what are we going to do?
I don't know.
Your mother's really done it now.
She's got to be the one to get us out of this.
Sam, that's like asking a cobra to help out a mongoose.
Just a minute.
I have an idea.
And it might work, but I'll need Mother's help.
If I can get her here.
Okay, but just keep Tabatha upstairs.
Bye, sweetheart.
Sam.
Can you create a diversion?
I'll do better than that.
Go on.
- Thanks, honey.
- You're welcome.
- Bye, honey.
- Bye-bye.
Come on, Mother.
I wanna show you what's been going on.
There must be at least Oh, it's remarkable what a little publicity will do.
I realize that you did what you did only out of love for Tabatha.
But you know what this means?
All her life, she'll have a mob of people around.
She'll never be alone.
Well, that's nothing to worry about, Samantha.
Little girls like to be the centre of attention.
I always did.
Well, if you're willing to make the sacrifice What sacrifice?
Well, she won't belong to any of us anymore.
She'll belong to her public.
You'll see her once or twice a year, if you make an appointment.
Appointment?
Appointment to see my own granddaughter?
You don't think you'll play with her or take her for a walk anytime you want, do you?
She'll be a celebrity.
- One lump or two?
- Well, is there any way to stop all this?
Well, I do have an idea.
But I'll need your help.
Right.
Hi there, Mrs. Kravitz, Mr. Kravitz.
Come on in.
- Make yourselves at home.
- Come in.
Thank you.
- I don't think they'll buy it.
- Keep your fingers crossed.
Well, how does it feel to be a celebrity, honey?
- I beg your pardon?
- She doesn't look any different to me.
That's the one that flies.
I asked you all over tonight because I'd like to make an apology.
Now, all this about Tabatha talking is an unfortunate misunderstanding.
Yes.
And once it got started, we just didn't know how to stop it.
Let's get to the point, Mrs. Stephens.
When did Tabatha start to talk?
That is the point.
She didn't.
I mean, she hasn't.
Perhaps I should explain.
You know, when I was younger, I was in vaudeville.
Maybe you heard of me.
I was known as Endora the Miraculous.
- She's miraculous all right.
- Thank you.
My specialty was ventriloquism.
I did baby voices.
They were really quite effective.
And so when this lady came over the other day I couldn't resist the temptation to try it out again.
So you see, Tabatha didn't really talk at all.
Now wait a minute.
I was this far away, and I saw this baby talk.
Would you mind not breathing in my face, sport?
Like that?
- Her lips moved that time.
- Oh, I don't know.
It's awful realistic.
She may have made Tabatha talk, but not by ventriloquism.
There's something very strange about her.
- Gladys, will you stop?
- No, I will not.
It is time that people found out about this house.
Oh, weird things go on in here.
They have powers, supernatural powers.
Oh, you wouldn't believe the things I've seen.
I guess I'll have to prove to you how simple it is to make a baby talk.
Here, darling, will you hold your child?
There.
- Now, then, Mrs. Kravitz - Don't touch me!
Oh, really, it's very easy, you know.
You can do it too.
Just throw your voice to the back of the throat and talk very high.
Go on.
Try it.
Oh, no, I will not.
Abner, make her stop.
She's gonna do something She did!
She turned me into a baby.
Hey, lady, that was pretty good.
So you see, that's all there was to it.
I'm awfully sorry if there was a misunderstanding.
You sure caused a sensation.
Well, we'll have to print a retraction.
- How does she stop?
- Talk in your normal voice.
I am talking in my normal voice.
Mother.
Wouldn't it be terrible if I were like this all my life?
- That I would agree with.
- Hey, I'm normal!
That I wouldn't agree with.
- Come on, Gladys.
- But But But But You see how simple it was?
I think you should tell Mother that you're sorry.
I know it was all her fault to begin with but she did a wonderful job of straightening everything out.
I'm sure she's forgiven you for the way you talked to her.
Forgiven me?
I must say, that's very sweet of her.
Mother.
Mother?
Where are you?
This is the last straw.
Sam, get her back here.
Mother.
Endora, you come back here and change my voice right away!
Thank you, Mother.
You're a great help.
That's what mothers are for, dear.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Anybody home?
Yes, sweetheart.
We're in the kitchen.
Darrin, dear, this is Brian O'Brian.
Well, well, Darrin me boy.
I've been looking forward to this moment, that I have.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Samantha is grand.
Just grand.
Brian is a leprechaun.
A leprechaun.
Yes, of course.
May I speak to you for a minute, dear?
- He just got over from Ireland.
- How about that?
As I said, Samantha is grand.
Samantha.
- Will you excuse me a minute, Brian?
- Dear lady, I'll excuse you anything.
As your husband and the head of this house it's no more than common courtesy that you forewarn me.
I know, dear.
Now, I've put up with elves, warlocks and poltergeists.
But this leprechaun relative of yours is just too much.
Darrin, he's not a relative of mine.
Relative, friend of family, it's all the same thing.
He's not a friend of my family.
- He's not?
- No.
He's a friend of your family.
We're very happy to have you, Brian.
Well, where else do you go but to friends in time of trouble.
- Trouble?
- I knew it.
The very gravest kind of trouble for a leprechaun.
My last pot of gold was stolen by an American.
Your last?
Well, every leprechaun has a few hidden here and there in Ireland.
Two of mine were lost when they drained some bogs and bulldozed them for a real-estate development.
And then there were a couple I lost on some confusing weekends.
The last one I hid behind a stove in the fireplace of the old Rafferty cottage.
They were dear friends and neighbours of the O'Brians.
Well, then along comes this rich American and buys the cottage and moves the fireplace to the United States before I can blink me eyes.
Before you could open them, you mean?
- The whole fireplace?
- Bodily.
Cobwebs, soot and my last pot of gold.
Oh, Brian, that's awful.
All your magical powers must have gone with it.
I'm no more than a shadow of me former self.
- How can we help you, Brian?
- Samantha!
Well, Darrin, he has to find his pot of gold.
Samantha, no witchcraft.
You know how I feel about that.
Yes, dear, I know, but I can't get it for him anyhow.
It's leprechaun gold.
It has a charm on it.
I can't move it.
Oh, I'll have to get it meself.
Now, the name of the party is James Dennis Robinson and he lives somewhere close by here.
Anyone that can move an entire fireplace from Ireland to America must be a very wealthy man.
Brian, you must be very tired from your trip.
That I am.
And the time change has me a little bewildered.
You go up to the guest room and make yourself comfortable.
Thank you.
I'll rest easy now knowing you're worrying about me problem.
Good night, cousin.
Oh, my.
It is nice having one of your relatives here for a change.
Samantha, he is not related to me.
He's just a figment of the imagination of my Irish ancestors.
Maybe so, but that figment just went to bed with your bottle.
All right.
I just have time to get a credit rating on this nonexistent pot-of-gold thief.
That's a good boy.
Hello, Miss Spence.
This is Darrin Stephens of McMann & Tate.
Would you see if you have anything on James Dennis Robinson?
Thank you very much.
I'll hang on.
Prepare yourself for the death of a very picturesque lie.
Never hurts to ask.
Yes, Miss Spence.
What?
I see.
I need a pencil.
Is that so?
That's very interesting.
May I please have that address again?
Seven Thank you, Miss Spence.
Thank you very much.
Are you gonna tell me or do you want me to guess?
Well, all right.
It just so happens there is a James Dennis Robinson and he owns Westchester Consolidated Mills.
- You've heard of the company?
- They're a large outfit.
And they don't do any advertising.
Every agency is dying to get their account.
- And he lives near here?
- Right.
And he has a fireplace with a pot of gold in it?
Credit agencies don't give out that kind of information.
Well, when you go to see him tomorrow, take a look around for it.
I will.
It's an interesting coincidence, your coming by to see me.
I have been considering changing my policy and doing some advertising.
- Oh, good.
But I'll tell you something else.
I have no intention of giving my account to McMann & Tate.
You're just not big enough for me.
Oh, size is no indication of quality, Mr. Robinson.
You're right.
Being little doesn't necessarily make you good.
That's what you meant, isn't it?
All we want is an opportunity to show you what we've done and what we think we can accomplish for you.
Now, your first advertising campaign should have real importance.
Something different.
What's the matter with you, young man?
Are you nervous or afraid to look me in the eye?
Not at all, sir.
I was just admiring your fireplace.
You've got good taste.
This fireplace came from Ireland.
I got it in a little cottage in County Cork.
Had it shipped over here.
This fireplace is over 200 years old.
That's all hand-hewn rock.
Is that so?
Get your hand off of there!
That's the original soot on there!
I don't want any fingermarks on it!
I'm sorry, Mr. Robinson.
I'm sorry, Stephens.
I didn't mean to be so sharp.
But this fireplace is my pride and joy.
Yes, sir.
To me it's worth its weight in gold.
Just because there's a fireplace doesn't mean there's any pot of gold in it.
Oh, it's there all right.
The only pot of gold I'm sure is there is his advertising account.
It's gonna be a lot tougher to get than yours.
Darrin, me boy, you helped me, I'll help you.
Do me a favour.
Just stick to leprechauning.
Tell me now you wouldn't be having more of this heart-warming elixir about, would you?
If you'll stop calling me cousin, I think I can find some.
Oh, that's a terrible heavy price you're asking.
Oh, but I'll pay.
Brian, when do you plan to go after your gold?
Well, now, there's a lot imponderables I have to be pondering upon.
It'd be easy if I had me powers but it would be asking for trouble to go now.
When the moon is new.
Well, isn't it also dangerous to go when the moon's full?
Not unless he's full too.
He's grand, Samantha, just grand.
I'm pleased and proud to be able to call him my My friend.
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
How's Tabatha?
- Oh, just fine.
Sleeping like a baby.
Brian's been entertaining her all day.
Told her about the time that he was official leprechaun to Queen Victoria.
Yeah, that's a real sleeping pill, that story.
- What's he doing now?
- Fixing your brown shoes.
- Fixing my shoes?
- Yes.
All leprechauns are shoemakers by trade or tradition.
He wanted to do something nice for you.
Darrin, me bucko.
I have a splendid surprise for you.
Your shoes needed fixing, and I fixed them.
Yes, you fixed them all right.
Yes, indeed.
Wait till you put them on.
It'll be a new experience in walking for you.
I'll fix up where I was working.
He fixed them.
I think I need a tranquilizer or two.
That did it!
That little man has got to go.
- Now, Darrin.
- No argument, Sam!
He's going tonight!
Brian!
Anything you say, me boy.
You name it.
After a long discussion, Samantha and I have decided you're going after your pot of gold tonight.
Well, now, maybe it'd be better tomorrow night.
Somehow I don't have the courage.
I know, you drank it all up!
Well, I'll buy you another bottle, but you're going tonight!
Allow me to introduce myself, sir.
My name is Brian O'Brian.
To whom do I have the honour of speaking?
I can't understand what all the commotion is about.
I merely lost me way on me way to a fancy dress ball.
You understand how a thing like that can happen to a man, can't you?
Of course.
So I took a shortcut through your living room, looking for a telephone.
I see.
Now, if you'll take your big hands off me, I'll be on me way.
What do you want me to do with him, Mr. Robinson?
Lock him up.
You heard the man.
So come on, Paddy.
Let's trot on down to the pokey, shall we?
What's your name, officer?
They call me Michael Francis Xavier Fogerty.
Well, now, you wouldn't be Irish, would you?
No, Polish.
Of course I'm Irish!
Well, you must know then from the manner of me dress what I am.
Well, now don't tell me.
Let me guess.
You're a nut!
- I am a leprechaun.
- Oh, sure, sure.
And I'm the Wicked Old Witch of the West.
All right, in with you.
And don't give me any more of that whimsy from the old sod!
Whimsy is it?
- Your mother was English.
- Flattering me will get you no place.
Now, will you step in, or shall I throw you in?
- I'm entitled to a telephone call.
- All right, all right.
- But do you have a lawyer?
- In a manner of speaking, yes.
Okay, one call.
Come on.
Hello.
Brian?
- Where are you?
- He's in jail.
- He's in jail.
- He's in jail.
What jail?
Oh, well, Brian, I don't think Well, wait a minute.
Let me speak to Darrin.
- Darling?
- You wanna go spring him, right?
- He must be in some kind of trouble.
- It couldn't happen to a nicer guy.
You don't want Brian to stay in jail, do you?
Darrin?
Darrin.
- I'm thinking.
- Oh, really.
Okay.
Go on down and get him out.
But after that, absolutely no more witchcraft!
All right, Brian.
I'll meet you in your cell.
Oh, yes.
He is grand, isn't he?
Samantha, you look beautiful, charming.
That's enough of that, Brian.
I must remind you that although you may not be a workingman my husband is, and you're disturbing his sleep.
Is he angry with me now?
I wouldn't have that for the world.
We have to get you out of here.
Then we have to decide how to get your gold.
- Take my hand.
- Now, just a moment.
I'd like to leave an insulting note for the black Irishman that arrested me, you know?
- I'm leaving, Brian.
Now!
- And I'm going with you.
Hey, nutsy, I brought you some coffee.
I think I need a little nip.
Darrin, me boy, how nice of you to wait up for me.
There's real friendship for you.
Here, I brought you a cup of coffee.
You are a disgrace to the O'Brians.
You've set the cause of leprechauns back 1000 years.
You're a bungler!
Don't you love him when he's like that, Samantha?
Full of the O'Brian fire.
I have the perfect solution for your troubles.
Samantha here will take me to the Robinson house.
I'll get me gold from the fireplace and with me powers restored to full strength l'll remove meself from your kind hospitality.
- Well?
- The answer is no!
Oh, but, Darrin, it would only take a moment or two.
- No.
- Think of the position we're in.
We have a hot leprechaun on our hands.
What is it?
I'm wondering if there'll be a reward out for him.
An O'Brian an informer?
Never!
Somebody always has to be the first.
Goodbye, Brian.
I've got a long day ahead of me.
I'm going back to bed.
- Goodbye, cousin.
- I am sorry, Brian.
- But we did our best.
- Oh, you're grand.
Both of you.
Just grand.
But I guess this will be the end of me now.
I'm a stranger in a strange land.
Well, maybe it'll work out somehow.
No.
Without me pot of gold, I'm just another old man you'd pass by in the street hat in hand, taking pennies from passers-by.
Now, Brian Sick at heart, wearing a brave but trembling smile.
- Well, you know I wanna help you.
- Dogs barking at me.
Little children making a mock of me.
But bearing no rancour in me heart because you couldn't spare me the five minutes help that would've kept me from the downward path.
- Well, Brian - I'll be leaving you now, Samantha.
Try and forget me.
Be as happy as you can.
I'll always think kindly of you.
Brian, if you promise never to tell Darrin, I'll go with you.
You will?
Oh, bless you.
But let's go.
I want to get back as soon as I can.
Hang on.
There's the old fireplace.
It's four to the left, one, two, three, four and eight down, one, two, three, four There's the monsters.
Splendid work.
Well, that's better.
Oh, pardon me.
My goodness gracious.
Now, you two keep very quiet and behave yourselves.
We're very busy.
Stay there.
You have a real touch.
Never mind the flattery.
Just find your pot of gold.
Right.
One, two, three, four And out she goes.
Here she comes.
What's the matter?
- Saints preserve us, it's gone.
- Brian!
- But it was here.
I know it was here.
- Darrin's right.
You are a bungler.
But, Samantha You probably lost that the same way you lost all the others.
No.
I swear it was here when the fireplace was moved.
It was me last pot, Samantha.
Me security against me old age.
How dare you involve me in this wild goose chase.
Now, we are going back, and you are going on your way.
No, I tell you.
It was right in this hole behind the stone.
Good evening.
Is this what you're looking for?
That's it!
It's me crock!
Let me correct you.
It is not your crock.
It's me crock!
I don't know how you got out of jail, but I know how you're getting in again.
And this time you're going to have some very pleasant company.
Mr. Robinson, I know this may all seem very strange to you, but Not at all.
Why it happens every night.
The police are gonna get very tired of my waking them up in the middle of the night.
Mr. Robinson, Mr. O'Brian here is from Ireland and he had hidden that pot in the fireplace before you bought it.
You know something tells me I haven't heard the real story yet.
Well, there's nothing left for me to do but to reveal meself to this creature.
Sir, you are looking at an authentic Irish leprechaun.
A leprechaun?
I am the lovable leprechaun of County Cork.
Well, I tried.
He doesn't believe it.
But, my dear sir, of course I believe you.
- You do?
- Well, naturally.
- I'm Irish too.
- Robinson?
Where do you think the Dennis in my name came from?
My sainted grandfather, may his soul rest in peace was a Mahoney.
Many is the story he's told me about meeting leprechauns in his day.
I wouldn't dream of keeping this now.
It's yours.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bless you.
Now, you see, Samantha, I wasn't lying to you.
Oh, forgive me, Brian.
- And this fair colleen?
- She Mr. Robinson, I'm Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
You remember, he was here talking to you about advertising.
Oh, yes.
McMann & Tate.
Yes.
You see, as a matter of fact his grandmother was also from County Cork.
It's all very clear to me now.
Those two Chihuahuas they wouldn't be my dogs, now, would they?
- Brian.
- My pleasure.
Well done!
- May I shake your hand, sir?
- Certainly, sir.
- I got you!
- Let go of me arm.
Now, I remember another story my grandfather told me about leprechauns.
If you catch one, he has to grant you a wish, right?
- Those are the rules.
- Very well.
Now, my mills are putting out a brand-new line of Irish linen.
For the first time, I'm going to advertise.
I want to use your picture as the symbol as the trademark for my product.
Mr. Robinson!
Leprechauns never lend themself to commercial enterprises.
Never.
Well, he'll be well paid for his services.
And I guarantee you, he'll make enough to fill up more pots of gold than he's ever seen before.
Well, now, your eloquence has convinced me, sir.
- Your wish is granted.
- Thank you.
- But I have a wish of me own.
- Very well, Mr. O'Brian.
I want to have a sympathetic and understanding presentation of me image.
And who could be more understanding than me dear friend, Mr. Darrin Stephens.
Very well, Mr. O'Brian.
Your wish is granted too.
Oh, thank you, Mr. Robinson.
May I break the news to him?
Of course, my dear.
Mr. O'Brian, what is it?
Me throat's a bit dry with all that talking.
Well, now, I've got the liquid cure for that.
Isn't he grand, Samantha?
Aye, just grand.
Of course I'm angry!
I wake up, and you're not in your bed!
- You're not even in the house.
- Darrin Then you come back and tell me you went to Robinson's house with Brian.
After I told you not to!
It's just a lucky thing you didn't get caught.
We did.
Mr. Robinson caught us there.
Oh, great!
Great!
Great!
Great!
That does it!
- Well, if you'd just let me explain.
- No, no, no, no.
There's nothing you could possibly say that would make me feel any different.
You deliberately went to that house after I told you not to!
McMann & Tate have the Robinson account.
And you're going to handle it.
Mr. Robinson is Irish.
He was delighted to see a leprechaun.
Brian has his pot of gold back, and he got you the account.
Now, you feel any differently?
What can I say?
You can say you love me.
That's easy.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
- You almost ready, honey?
- Be right there.
We don't want to be late.
I promised Larry we'd be there at 7 sharp.
We will be.
I don't mean to rush you, sweetheart.
It's just that it takes women longer to get dressed than it does men.
Oh, and, honey, be particularly nice to Miss Kabaker, will you?
I'll kill her with kindness.
You know what an important client Mr. Kabaker is.
His daughter carries a lot of weight with him.
I understand.
So if she has a good time, then he will too.
Of course.
It'll mean a lot to Larry and the agency.
How are you doing, sweetheart?
We better get going.
Oh, I'm hurrying, sweetheart.
Hey, you're getting faster.
I only beat you by a handkerchief.
I saved a lot of time by taking a shower with my dress on.
- Well, let's go.
- Darrin?
Nice party, isn't it?
I'll say.
Another mad whirl with the jet set.
Mind if we borrow you for a moment, J.K.?
Oh, excuse me, dear.
We'll bring your father right back, Miss Kabaker.
Just a little dull business.
So is this party.
I'm sure it always seems that way when you don't know many people.
That's why I hate affairs like this.
Just because somebody handles your father's account you have to mingle like you had something in common.
It must be very trying.
But you certainly chose a lovely dress for the occasion.
It's not difficult when one has taste, Mrs. Stubbins.
Stephens.
My compliments on your dress, Mrs. Stephens.
Thank you.
It's really difficult to tell those inexpensive copies from the originals nowadays.
- Do you know Dr. Hafta, dear?
- I beg your pardon?
Dr. Hafta, the plastic surgeon.
Does beautiful nose work.
No, I don't know him.
It's funny.
I could've sworn when you Oh, well.
Excuse me.
No, thank you.
What's the matter, darling?
You look like Darrin just cancelled all your charge accounts.
I shouldn't let it bother me, I guess.
That Miss Kabaker is the most disagreeable little snob I've ever met.
Well, cheer up.
There's always a sour meatball in the chafing dish.
Maybe she'll get it.
Go on over.
Please.
Have you tried the meatballs?
No, I never eat them myself.
Well, I hope I'll be seeing more of you.
Maybe we could get together for lunch some afternoon.
You think about food a lot, don't you?
- Well, no, l - I wish I could be like you.
Carefree, not give a darn what my figure looks like.
- What's the matter?
- You threw it at me.
Good heavens.
She did it.
She deliberately threw that at me.
Never mind, daughter.
I'll take you home.
Really, Larry, the conduct of some of your guests leaves a lot to be desired.
I'm sorry, J.K. I'm sure Mrs. Stephens wouldn't do anything like that.
- She threw the thing at me.
- It was an accident.
I'll call you "Nothing," she says.
One little favour I ask you to do.
And what do you do?
You wiggle that beak of yours and really cause trouble.
The least you could've done was ignore her.
You're a great little helpmate, you are.
Always anxious to help your husband's career.
Darrin, you didn't speak to me all the way home in the car would you please show me the same courtesy now?
Gladly.
Good night.
Good night.
And another thing.
I'll tell you when we're not talking.
I wear the pants in this family.
Says you.
Says me.
And I'll say one more thing.
- What?
- Now we're not talking.
Now you're talking.
Hi, Larry.
I guess you're still pretty upset about last night.
I passed upset at 3:00 this morning.
Right now, I'm up to homicidal.
Mr. Kabaker was pretty mad last night.
Wonder what he's thinking this morning.
I know what I'm thinking.
But I'm too much of a gentleman to use certain phrases about a woman.
So let's put it this way: If I saw that your wife was going to be hit by a falling safe l'd just stand there and smile.
Larry, that's not very nice.
I passed nice at 2:00 this morning right after Kabaker phoned to cancel the account.
Fortunately, I was able to talk him out of it.
I'm sorry about that but Sam was provoked into doing what she did.
It was thoughtless and inexcusable.
- A child would've had more sense.
- Wait a minute.
Kabaker's daughter deserved it.
She's a sarcastic snob.
Her father ought to wash her mouth with that crummy detergent he makes.
That crummy detergent happens to keep us in business.
Sure, Miss Kabaker can do no wrong as long as her father's got wall-to-wall money.
If you were a billionaire, Samantha still acted like a child.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
At least she could've used a little discretion, like my wife.
Larry.
I've got news for you.
That wife of yours has come up with a few nuggets herself.
Oh, really?
If we're talking about boners, let's get all the names on the list.
Name me just one boner that Louise ever pulled.
Just one.
The time she thought the client's wife was his mother.
The time she forgot the theatre tickets.
- There was - I said one.
So don't go making cracks about my wife.
Just worry about that cuckoo that you're married to.
Well if Louise is such a drag, you don't have to associate with her anymore.
Agreed.
And you can consider Samantha off-limits too.
In fact, you don't have to associate with me anymore.
Well, let's add my vote to that proposal and make it unanimous.
Great.
Keep your big, flat feet out of my office and I'll keep mine out of yours.
- I'll go you one better.
I'll keep my feet and everything attached to them out of the building.
- I quit.
- Good.
You just saved me two weeks severance pay.
Cheap.
Cheap, cheap.
Hi.
I thought I heard you come in.
What are you doing home?
I got sick.
- Sick?
- Of working.
I quit.
Quit?
Quit.
Evacuated the premises.
Ceased working.
Hit the road.
What happened?
I shouldn't be telling you this.
- Why not?
- Because we're not talking.
Well, if we were talking did it have anything to do with what happened last night?
Larry and I got into an argument and he said some things about you I didn't like.
You said some pretty unkind things about me yourself.
That's different.
I'm your husband.
I appreciate your defending me.
But whatever he said, he was right.
And so were you.
I should've had more control last night.
Well, Kabaker's daughter deserved it.
Well, I still could've ignored her.
I wouldn't let you ignore her.
You did the right thing.
Darrin, when you pick a side, will you please stick with it?
It's over and done with.
I've got another job lined up.
I've gotta hurry over to an interview.
Another job?
Darrin, that's ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
Ames Advertising has had feelers out for me for a long time.
Well, they're gonna get me.
I hope you don't get it.
I can't miss.
I'm the perfect man for the job.
Louise, it's ridiculous.
Larry and Darrin are simply being stubborn.
We have to figure out a way to get them together.
Agreed.
Larry always did have a stubborn streak.
Like when we were dating.
I knew that if I was the first to mention the word "marriage," I was dead.
How did you finally get the idea across?
One night he blew a smoke ring I stuck my finger through it and said, "I do".
Oh, men are such little boys, really.
They don't know what's good for them.
Right.
And it's up to us to show them that they can live happy, contented lives even if it makes them miserable.
How do we get our two mules together when they're not even talking?
Do you have any ideas?
It's very simple really.
The way to unite people is to give them a common enemy.
Well, I'll buy that.
Now, in Darrin and Larry's case the common enemy will be us.
Us?
- You mean a war of the sexes?
- Oh, no, no.
Not an all out war.
Just a skirmish.
We'll not only get them together, we'll teach them a lesson.
So, what's your plan?
I can't wait to hear it.
- Well - Oh, I just had a terrible thought.
- What?
- It's too late.
You said Darrin was taking that other job.
I wouldn't worry about that.
Darrin doesn't have a chance of landing that job with Ames Advertising.
How can you be so sure?
I'm a witch.
You said it, honey.
I didn't.
How about that.
Now Stephens, I'm very glad you could get in to see us.
Was the traffic bad?
No.
Actually, I came in on the choo-choo.
- Choo-choo?
- I meant the train.
I hadn't eaten, so it gave me a chance to relax and have my din-din.
I see.
Food's really quite good.
Of course, nobody can cook like my mummy.
Mommy.
Mother.
She really knows how to fill your tum-tum.
Yes.
Stephens, your credentials are most impressive.
You know, I always say that all horses have teeth and a tail.
But it's that old track record that makes thoroughbreds.
Stephens.
What are you doing?
I'm sucking my thumb.
Sucking your thumb?
Yes.
I always suck my thumb when I'm afraid.
- You're joking.
- Oh, no, no.
I wish I had my teddy bear.
Mr. Stephens, I'm sorry, but this interview is over.
Oh, Mr. Ames, I don't know what to say.
- This isn't me.
- I don't care.
Whoever it is, his interview is at an end.
Mr. Ames, please, if you'll just let me explain.
There's some reason, for this going on I made a boo-boo.
Get out of my sight!
Mr. Ames, it's like some strange force got ahold of me.
It's Samantha!
Out!
I believe this is yours.
Samantha!
I have a strong feeling Bad words will fly Your daddy just came home With blood in his eyes Samantha!
Where are you?
Well, Tabatha, time for beddy-bye.
Now, I'm gonna do something to your daddy that you're too little to understand.
But it's for his own good.
Sam!
Wish me luck.
Sam, where are you?
- Come out here and face me.
- Yes?
You've been sticking your nose where it doesn't belong again.
- Don't try to deny it.
- All right, I won't.
Come on, Sam.
Don't make me drag it out of you.
Just You admit it?
I only did it to save you from making the biggest mistake of your life.
That I did on a day long ago which we now laughingly call our anniversary.
Go ahead, rave on.
Let me know when the steam comes out of your nose.
You can help with the ironing.
When will you learn to stop meddling in my business?
When you learn to conduct it better.
Oh, well, I can't be doing too bad.
You've got a lovely house, a nice car, lovely clothes.
But to you, I suppose, I'm still a big dumb-head?
- I didn't say that.
- But you're thinking it.
- Go ahead, out with it.
- Really, Darrin.
- Go ahead, say it.
- Okay.
You're a big dumb-head.
You're calling me names now.
When you talk like that, you are a dumb-head.
- I'll tell you one more thing - Hold it.
Hold it.
Stop the world.
We are about to get the word from the high lama.
If you had any sense, you would get down on your hands and knees and crawl back to Larry Tate and beg his forgiveness.
Me, crawl?
Well, we both know that without him you'd be nothing.
He taught you everything you know.
He taught me?
Well, that does it.
That really does it.
Excuse me, I have to fix dinner.
Don't bother setting a place for me because I'll be eating out.
Good, more for me.
And don't bother turning down my side of the bed because I'll be sleeping on the sofa.
As long as you're eating out, why don't you sleep out too?
What?
Sam, this isn't like you.
It is now.
Well, then I'll do just that.
As of now, my address is the club.
What do you think of that?
I think I better call you a cab.
I'll need the car for shopping.
Louise?
Anybody home?
Hi, dear.
I know all about it.
I spoke to Samantha.
Figures.
It's none of my business but you're being stubborn about this thing.
I agree.
- That you're being stubborn?
- That it's none of your business.
You got a bicarbonate?
I've got a knot in my stomach.
You've also got one in your head.
Well, I've got news for you, tinted-top I run my business the way I see fit.
And I don't need any suggestions from the corset crowd.
Be my guest, Snow White.
And let me drop another thought on your pointed, little ears.
Some men are fortunate enough to have wives that are understanding and sympathetic.
After a hard day in the rat race they don't have to come home to a mouse that roars.
I believe the last word is my prerogative so I'll take it.
If I were you, I'd crawl to Darrin on my hands and knees and beg his forgiveness.
- Me crawl?
- Oh, come on, Larry.
We both know it's his brilliant mind that made you everything you are today.
Without him you'd be nothing.
Are you serious?
Well, let's face it.
I married you, Larry, but you're not the smartest man in the world.
- Louise.
- Yes?
Louise.
You wanna try for double-or-nothing on my last name?
The discussion is at an end.
Fine.
I'll get dinner.
Or would you prefer to eat out?
That's the best idea you've had in years.
Nag, nag, nag.
Yakety-yak-yak.
If you feel that way about it you'd be better off where you can't hear my voice.
- Louise, you're driving me to the club.
- I don't have time.
Here are your keys.
Drive yourself.
Desk.
Could you tell me if Mr. Darrin Stephens has checked in yet?
He has.
What room is he in?
He's in 909.
Would you like me to ring him?
Oh, no.
No, don't bother.
Oh, Mr. Larry Tate will be arriving very soon.
I'm sure you'll make him comfortable.
Eddie, can I have a room for the night?
Yes, sir, Mr. Tate.
Room 909.
- I'll ring for a bellboy.
- Don't bother.
- Larry.
- What are you doing here?
- I might ask you the same question.
- It's none of your business.
They got our rooms mixed up.
I'll get another one.
Don't tell me you had a fight with Louise.
That's my business.
I suppose you had a fight with Samantha.
That's my business.
What's the matter with you?
How could you walk out on a great girl like Louise?
How could you run out on a marvellous girl like Samantha?
- I thought you didn't like Samantha.
- I thought you didn't like Louise.
- What gave you that idea?
- Your big mouth.
I said those things in anger.
You should've known.
So did I. And if you weren't so thick-headed, you'd know I'm crazy about Sam.
Larry, we're a couple of numskulls.
You said it.
- I'm sorry, Lar - I'm sorry, Dar Well, now we can enjoy our newfound bachelorhood together.
Right.
- Freedom.
It's wonderful.
- It's marvellous.
Do anything we want.
No one to answer to.
Play poker.
Go bowling.
Golf every weekend.
More time at the club.
Yeah.
I hate poker and bowling.
Golf gives me the hives.
This place is depressing.
Darrin?
Yeah?
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I think so.
Last one packed pays for the room.
Wouldn't you know it, Louise's car.
Figures.
She was miserable at home without me.
Poor kids.
Must be crying on each other's shoulders.
- Oh, thanks, Larry.
- You're welcome.
Well, look who's back.
The freedom fighters.
Have some champagne.
We're celebrating.
Louise, we're going home.
- Oh, really, Larry.
- Louise.
Nag, nag, nag.
Louise, don't forget your Ouija board.
- Wasn't that fun?
- Fascinating.
Goodnight, Samantha.
- Night, Darrin.
- Night, Larry.
Louise.
- Night, Samantha.
- Night-night.
Did I just detect a sly smile on your upper lip?
Smile?
It suddenly occurs to me that it's more than coincidence that Larry and I ended up in the same room.
Stranger things have happened.
Especially in this house.
And I'll tell you something else: If you've been meddling with your witchcraft again I couldn't care less.
Now let me tell you something.
If you think you can walk back through that door and all is forgiven you're absolutely right.
Sam, isn't it amazing how stupid a man can be?
Oh, yes.
You certainly were, sweetheart.
I meant Larry.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
- Sam!
- Oh, out here, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
Hello, young lady.
How are you?
How are you?
You promised to clean out the garage.
Oh, honey, I'm afraid it'll have to wait.
I've gotta go to a lecture.
Lecture?
He's our client.
He has a new book coming out and we'll be handling the promotion and his lecture tour.
Were you planning to go alone?
Oh, no, Larry and Louise will be stopping by to pick me up.
We'll be going to the afternoon lecture.
What's he lecturing about?
Nothing you'd be interested in.
Try me.
Okay.
The title is Witchcraft of the World: Fact and Fallacies.
The lecturer wouldn't be, by any chance Osgood Rightmire, would it?
- You've heard of him.
He's a smug phoney who's been making a living for years telling all sorts of lies about witches.
Then there's no sense in going and ruining your afternoon.
I'm going.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
No, you're not going.
There's no sense in going and spoiling your whole day.
Oh, Darrin, don't be silly.
He's too ridiculous to be taken seriously.
I just thought it might be amusing to hear him.
Couldn't I go if I promised to be good?
Larry will be picking me up in half an hour.
- No time to arrange for a babysitter.
- I have an idea.
- Lf it's what I think - Mother!
- Now, wait a minute.
- Mother, could I see you for a moment?
Well, Samantha, I hope it's something important.
Mother, we have to go out for a couple of hours.
Would you mind sitting with Tabatha until we get back?
Well, all right.
I've got to get back to Tokyo for a few minutes.
A nice young Japanese poet is going to read me some of his love ballads.
I'll be right back.
She certainly gets around.
Oh, Darrin.
You know, she's really awfully good about babysitting.
For Mother, that is.
Well, I'll go and change.
- I'm really looking forward to this.
- Remember, you promised to be good.
Aren't I always?
If I say yes, I'll be lying.
If I say no, I'm in trouble.
No comment.
- Come on, honey, we'll be late.
- Coming.
I think Sam will enjoy this.
Osgood Rightmire is a fascinating man.
Is that so?
Larry says he's considered the top authority in his field.
- By whom?
- Oh, you know.
Whoever it is who decides who top authorities are.
He really is highly respected.
He's been all over the world.
To all kinds of exotic places.
He's lived with witch doctors and voodoo men.
It's been a lifelong study with him.
Oh, well, everyone should have a hobby.
Maybe you'll get a chance to talk to him later.
Darrin, I took the liberty of asking him to join us here after the lecture.
Larry, I don't know.
Maybe he'll be tired.
Oh, goody.
Just think, Darrin, an authority on witchcraft here in our own little home.
Well, we better get going.
Come on, dear.
Genies, voodoo spirits leprechauns, trolls and witches are the companions of dull, primitive and ignorant people.
- Well, that covers me.
- He's insufferable.
Mind you, it's true that my extensive research has uncovered certain inexplicable events that have been attributed to so-called witches.
However after intensive investigation I have found that these manifestations are all manufactured or self-induced.
Believe me, there are no witches.
- Wonderful, isn't he?
- Incredible.
And why do people like to call themselves witches?
Well, I've met a great many people with so-called supernatural powers in my time and I'll tell you what I found out.
Scratch a witch and you'll find a neurotic bore who has no other claim to be interesting.
Relax, honey.
Just relax.
Relax, honey!
Now, in case there are any of you in the audience who think you are a witch, let me say this: Here I am, Osgood Rightmire a 20th-century witch-hunter and your mortal enemy.
Cast your spells.
Strike me down.
I offer myself as your target.
- Samantha!
- I'm sorry, darling.
It just slipped out.
It won't happen again.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Ladies and gentlemen, you may think that I staged that but I didn't.
It was an accident.
However, that's the way superstitions start.
If I were a superstitious man I would say that a witch did it.
But I would have a remedy.
I would simply say: Any witches which are here From this moment disappear And with that, they would disappear.
- Sam?
- Yes, dear?
- Where are you?
- Well It can't be much of a spell.
Louise is still here.
That'll do, hon.
Thanks for the lift, Larry.
We'll see you after dinner.
- I'll bring Bob Andrews, if it's all right.
- Fine.
If he gives us that Rightmire article, it'll be a big help to the national tour.
Wonderful.
Bye-bye.
- See you later.
- So long.
You sure you're all right?
Oh, don't worry, Darrin.
It was just that one time.
I'm sure it couldn't happen again.
It was pretty scary.
How would he know an incantation like that?
Must've picked it up in his travels somewhere.
Amateurs shouldn't fool around with things like that.
Honey, I hate to mention it but somebody else did start the whole thing.
I know.
I'm sorry.
- Well, when he's here tonight, no - Don't worry, Darrin.
I'll be a good little witch.
Sam?
Sam!
- Sam, are you still here?
- I am in spirit, darling.
Right over here.
Would you mind proving it?
Oh, honey.
This is a lot more serious than we thought.
- What are you gonna do about it?
- Mother?
Mother!
You'll wake the baby!
Oh, what a sweet child.
It's a pleasure to be with her.
She slept the whole time.
Mother.
- What's this?
- Samantha!
Samantha?
Mama, I've got a problem.
Mother, have you found anything yet?
No, there's nothing in here.
Oh, I'll find it, all right.
- How do you feel, sweetheart?
- Well Just hang on, darling.
Your lips feel funny.
That's because you kissed me on the eye.
- Do something!
- Oh, it's your fault.
How could you expose your wife to a dangerous fanatic like Rightmire?
Wait a minute.
I didn't want her to go.
She insisted.
Oh, I was under the impression that you were the head of the house.
This is no time to bicker.
Do you know how to stop it?
Can you remember what Rightmire said?
No.
It didn't even sound like an authentic incantation.
That's bad, huh?
Oh, I've seen some cases that would make your hair turn blue.
Well, I'll just have to borrow some more books from Aunt Clara.
Oh, my stars!
Well, it must be some exotic incantation.
And since it was executed by an amateur well, it can't be that powerful.
I'll just have to do some more research.
- Hey, I made a comeback.
- Thank goodness.
Hey, I don't know how long it's gonna last.
In the meantime, put a cold compress on your head take two aspirin and above all, keep yourself warm.
- Any symptoms?
- Not yet.
Darrin, could I have a drink of water?
Sure thing, honey.
Darrin.
Sam!
Endora!
- When did it happen?
- Just now.
I wish you could remember a little more of what that simpleton said.
What did it sound like?
I wasn't listening.
It was those ibbety-bibbety-sibbety-sab things "Out goes Y-O-U," and out she went.
Oh, you're a great help.
Try to remember so I'll know where to look.
Mother, it was one of those things I've never heard before.
I'll go down and ask Rightmire.
It's as simple as that.
You should've thought of that sooner.
I'll catch him before the evening lecture.
Well, don't trust your human memory.
Write it down!
You missed.
- Well, here I am again.
- Oh, darling, sit down.
Everything's going to be all right, dear.
Mother's here.
I was particularly impressed with the way you handled that situation when Well, you know.
Thank you, but I'd rather not be reminded.
I warned the management.
They better fix that platform, or they'll have a lawsuit.
The way you leaped right up and turned it into a point in your lecture.
Any witches which are here Something or other Disappear What'd you say first?
Mr. Stephens, my contract in this town is for two lectures.
I do not intend to give a third in my dressing room.
I thought I might use it for a publicity release.
But you have my colourful personality to work with, Stephens.
What else do you want?
Besides, the spell will be in my book which is coming out next month and I do not believe in giving away anything for nothing.
- But, Mr. Rightmire, I believe that - Thank you for dropping by, Stephens.
You will be at our house tonight after the lecture, won't you?
Possibly.
Who else will be there?
Mr. Andrews, the editor of Pictorial Week.
All right, Stephens.
Rightmire should be through with his lecture about now.
We're anxious for you to meet him, Mr. Andrews.
I wonder if he does that business of tripping at each performance.
Of course he does.
It was so obviously staged.
Didn't you think so, Sam?
Yes, yes, of course.
He kidded about the accident being caused by a witch and then he recited a spell to send the witch into limbo.
I wonder if he'd tell me his secret.
I have a few relatives I'd like to make disappear.
The entire lecture sounds like nonsense.
I found it quite interesting.
Didn't you, Samantha?
- Where did Samantha go?
- She was here just a second ago.
I wonder where she disappeared to.
- What happened?
- I ran into some thick air.
I'll take a look in the kitchen.
That's probably where she is.
The kitchen.
Honey.
Honey, are you in here?
Yes, dear.
- Well, where are you?
- I'm right here.
Honey, try to hold on until Rightmire gets here.
Then everything will be all right.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Mr. Rightmire.
Oh, no, Mr. Rightmire But, Mr. Rightmire, we're all expecting you.
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you, Stephens but I'm rather tired and I have some important research to do tonight.
Yes.
Well, please extend my apologies to whoever it may concern, all right?
Goodbye.
Now, my dear l'm all yours.
- Oh, Mr. Rightmire.
- Osgood.
- I's good too.
Oh, no, my dear.
Osgood is my first name.
What's yours?
Beverly.
And I'm thrilled, just thrilled to meet you.
Well, it was most sweet of you to come backstage and say such nice things about my modest little effort.
Oh, it wasn't modest at all.
It was what you were talking about that just drives me crazy.
It's so So - Fascinating?
- No, spooky.
But, Mother, we have to get him here to find out what the spell was.
Don't worry, dear.
Osgood Rightmire will be here.
- How can you be so sure?
- Why, his research will bring him here.
Right to Morning Glory Circle.
But Let me concentrate.
I thought we might go to some nice, intimate little club and get to know each other better, what?
Oh, that sounds just marvey.
And I know just the place.
Good.
Where is it?
On Morning Glory Circle.
Well, lead the way.
Maybe we should've picked Mr. Rightmire up.
He might've gotten lost.
Not a chance, I assure you.
How can you be so sure?
Mother means that any man who has hacked his way through mysterious jungles shouldn't have a problem.
He'll be here any minute now.
Is something wrong with the engine?
What does it sound like?
Well, I'm not mechanical.
That, my dear, is a matter of opinion.
Where's this club you were telling me about?
I don't know.
Well, why did you say it was here?
I don't know.
Well, I'll just go in the house and call the auto club.
It's cold out here.
Can I come with you?
Oh, very well.
Oh, pardon me.
My car Mr. Rightmire.
How nice of you to come.
Stephens.
I decided my research could wait.
Well, good, good.
And I brought along my niece who lives here in the town.
- Beverly?
- Niece?
- Beverly Niece.
- No, Beverly Wilson.
Beverly Wilson.
This is Mr. Darrin Stephens.
- Well, hello there.
- How do you do?
We were afraid you couldn't find the place.
There's some people here who are very anxious to meet you.
Won't you come in?
One word out of you and I'll kill you.
I was having a drink with a major near the officers' mess in Bonga-Bonga and the door opened and in came this diminutive colonel approximately 9 inches high.
Immaculately dressed in every way.
He swarmed up the stool to the bar and ordered a drink.
The major said to the colonel, he said: "Colonel, tell Mr. Osgood about the time you fell out with a witch doctor".
- Can I freshen anybody's drinks?
- No, thank you.
Well, this has been most interesting, Mr. Rightmire.
Thank you, Mr. Andrews.
Of course, it's only one of many stories I have concerning witchcraft.
- Fascinating, Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes, indeed.
I could listen to him all night, couldn't you?
Well, perhaps not quite Honey.
Pass me the ashtray, would you, Beverly, dear?
Yes, sir.
I've been away for several years and I'm afraid my niece is a little awed by her illustrious uncle.
- Isn't that it, dear?
- Yes, Uncle Rightmire.
- Osgood.
- Who?
Mr. Rightmire, I'd like to do an article on you and your work.
I was telling him about the way you handled that situation this afternoon.
Oh, that.
Yes, he was positively wonderful.
You bet.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Osgood.
I'm particularly interested in witchcraft, Mr. Rightmire.
What was the spell you put on the witches in the audience?
An ancient peasant incantation I translated from the Hungarian.
Yes, we were trying to remember it.
How does it go?
As a publisher, I'm sure Mr. Andrews will appreciate the answer that I gave to your son-in-law earlier: Read my book.
He's absolutely right.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
Mother?
Mother!
He did it to me.
And without the incantation.
Mother, where are you?
Here I am.
Mother, he's a warlock.
He could be.
Yes, he certainly could be.
And we've got to find out.
We'll just have to give him the ordeal by fire.
But how, and with what?
The most simple test is to give him a glass of cayenne red peppers, hot sauce and a little tomato juice.
Of course.
If he can drink that, he's a warlock, all right.
I was in a village in darkest Africa investigating some strange voodoo rites and the chief came up to me and said Excuse me.
After midnight, everyone.
Time for bloody marys.
- Oh, that's a marvellous idea.
- Fine.
Oh, thank you, Endora.
Thank you very much.
Well, here's to the success of your book, Mr. Rightmire.
Thank you.
Cayenne and red pepper?
What for?
You almost killed him.
To prove he isn't a warlock.
He doesn't even know what he's doing.
He's a stupid bungler.
- Mother.
- What?
Maybe he has a charm, a talisman of some sort that he doesn't know anything about.
Yes.
Yes, that has to be it.
- All right, back to the living room.
- Yes.
Really, I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Rightmire.
I hope you're feeling better.
- Fine, thank you.
- I made you a fresh one.
No more, dear lady, no more.
Incidentally, I'm sure none of you know this, but the bayou folk of Louisiana use cayenne and red peppers as a test for warlocks.
That's a rather interesting ring, Mr. Rightmire.
Where did you get it?
From an old mystic who lived at the headwaters of the Nile.
- May I see it?
- This ring never leaves my finger.
Except for you, dear lady.
Did you see that?
It practically jumped out of my hand.
- Mother, I'm getting that feeling again.
- Me too.
Come on.
It can't have gone very far.
No, I thought - Look above your hand.
- You looking under the sofa?
It's got to be in this room.
All right.
You first, dear.
Thank you, Mother.
It's too dangerous to be in the hands of an amateur.
- Well, we can't let him have it back.
- No.
He'll never know the difference.
Come on.
Is this the ring you're looking for?
Yes.
Where did you find it?
In the kitchen.
It must've rolled there.
It's a busy little ring, isn't it?
Yes, well, I'd better be toddling along.
I have to get Miss Wilson back home.
I'm sure your little niece isn't used to being out so late.
Hey, what about the car, Uncle Rightmire?
Oh, yes, of course.
The auto club.
Oh, doesn't it work?
Why don't you try it again.
Yes.
Yes, I'll do that.
Well, Mrs. Stephens, thank you so much.
Oh, no, Mr. Rightmire.
Thanks to you, we've had an enchanting evening.
So be it.
Let me sum up by saying what you've all heard many times before: Discount coincidence, discredit fate dispense with superstition and you'll be secure, as I am in the conviction that there is no such thing as witchcraft.
Mr. Rightmire?
Mr. Rightmire?
Ta-ta.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes.
I'm Harriet Kravitz, Abner's sister.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Kravitz.
- I thought I'd pop in to say hello and to return this saucepan Gladys borrowed.
Please come in.
- Do excuse the mess.
- That's okay.
You go right ahead.
Abner's taken Gladys to spend a couple of weeks with her mother.
- How nice.
- Not for Abner.
He can't stand her mother.
That's why he's driving back tomorrow.
I'm gonna be keeping house while Gladys is gone.
Well, if there's anything I can do to help, you just call me.
Oh, I will.
Gladys has told me a lot about you, Mrs. Stephens.
- Oh, really?
- Oh, nothing bad, you understand.
Just what a good neighbour you are.
- Nothing else at all.
- Glad to hear it.
Anyway, I'm a person who likes to judge people for themselves.
You always paint in the living room?
Well, Tabatha is asleep upstairs.
I just wanted to be near her if she cried.
You'll never get two coats of paint out of that little can.
- No?
- Not unless you're some kind of magi What I mean is, you won't even get one coat of paint out of that.
- That's what I was gonna say.
- Well, that's too bad.
I'll just have to work it out somehow.
Thanks for bringing the saucepan.
You can put it down over there.
Cute.
Isn't that silly?
I walked out with the saucepan.
The chair shrunk.
It wasn't Sanforized.
Miss Kravitz, surely you don't think that that's the chair you saw a minute ago?
I like them.
I like them very much.
Thank you, Mr. Robbins.
As a matter of fact, I like your entire campaign.
I think Robbins Baby Food Company and McMann & Tate can do business.
- Right, George?
- The campaign could be quite effective.
Good.
We'll start to work on it right away.
No.
I'd like to defer our final decision for 10 days.
- Ten days?
- You need that much time?
Well, I guess that's about it, gentlemen.
I may be president of the company, but Mr. Barkley is in charge of advertising.
And I believe in giving my executives a completely free hand.
Very commendable attitude, I'm sure.
George has only been with us two months.
But he's a young man, new ideas.
He's really been shaking up us old fuddy-duddies.
I'll contact you in 10 days.
Thank you.
George is a cautious man and probably just wants time to think.
- I'm sure we can do business, Darrin.
- I hope so.
All right.
What did you find out about Darrin Stephens?
Well, I've been shadowing him for a week.
I also dug into his past.
Mr. Barkley, he's as clean as a whistle.
You didn't uncover any vices?
- You can't win them all.
- It seems too good to be true.
Mr. Barkley, nobody's got a nose for dirt like Charlie Leach.
And let me tell you, this guy makes Mickey Mouse seem like Jack the Ripper.
Can I have my money now?
You'll get paid when the job is finished.
Finished?
You want me to investigate that Stephens some more?
- No, his wife.
- His wife?
Leach, this company sells baby food.
It's imperative that the character of our representatives be wholesome, unblemished, and above all, normal.
This applies to their wives too.
I'll start with the neighbours.
They usually clam up but sometimes you come up with a live one.
Do you want me to start at the beginning or just hop around?
Any way you like, lady.
Well, I've only seen one unusual thing, but Gladys, my sister-in-law has told me of many, many odd occurrences.
I thought she might be exaggerating.
Now I'm sure she was telling the truth.
Go ahead.
You see, the credit company I work for is interested in anything you've got to say.
Well, there was the time she made the baby fly.
The baby wanted to go by train?
No, she didn't put the baby on a plane, she just made it fly upstairs.
And then she had these green square spots and Gladys saw an ostrich in the living room and Am I going too fast for you?
She saw an ostrich in Mrs. Stephens' living room?
And an elephant, a baby elephant.
I think that came later.
She turned this old man into an elephant.
Of course, there was something funny about him too.
He was a wizard who made flowers dance.
Your sister-in-law told you all this?
Yes.
But I believe everything she said.
She also gave her husband this long nose and this funny hair.
- Where are you going?
- I've got more than enough to go on.
But there's more, much more.
Wanna hear about when the bottom half of her disappeared?
Some other time.
Now, you just go to sleep and Mommy's gonna plant some pretty flowers in the garden.
Yeah.
Daisies and roses and all sorts of things.
Oh, dear.
There, that's better.
Hi there.
You must be the little lady of the house.
No, she's asleep in her carriage.
I'm Mrs. Stephens.
Always did like a dame, I mean a lady, with a good sense of humour.
You can wipe that worried look right off your pretty little face.
I ain't selling nothing.
I'm doing a little consumer research on bottle tops.
Well, I'd like to help you, but I really am rather busy right now.
Oh, this'll just take a jiff.
Before I get your opinion on tops l'd like some information about your Did I miss a spot?
Were you working on this when I rang your doorbell?
- No, I was out back, gardening.
- Gardening?
I like to make things grow.
I really would love to help you, so could we get on with this?
Sure.
Sure, lady.
Say, this is quite a place you've got here.
- Thanks.
- All paid for?
Does that affect my qualification to judge bottle tops?
You don't have to hide anything from me, Mrs. Stephens.
Everything you tell me is strictly on the q.t. Thanks.
- Is that your kid?
- No, we rent her by the month.
Funny.
I have this questionnaire here that I have to fill out.
- Do you drink?
- Well, yes, from time to Does it really ask that?
You don't have to answer if you don't want to.
I can see you take a belt I mean, a drink sometimes.
The red nose is a dead giveaway, huh?
Oh, I noticed the booze over there.
You do, don't you?
Only with my meals.
Drinks with meals.
Mostly at breakfast.
- You drink at breakfast?
- Doesn't everyone?
I mean, it was a bit of a problem at first.
- Problem?
- Yes.
I didn't know whether you should drink red wine or white wine with oatmeal.
So I finally compromised and settled on Scotch.
Breakfast is my favourite meal.
I see.
Any more questions?
I wondered if you had other hobbies apart from making things grow like Bridge, knitting, golf, magic.
Magic?
How'd that get in there?
A lot of people go in for magic tricks in their spare time.
Have you been talking to Harriet Kravitz?
Never heard of her.
Excuse me.
All right, Tabatha.
Don't you cry anymore.
We'll just take a little walk over here and everything will be all right.
Yes, it will.
Good.
Then there was the time she made three dresses in 10 seconds.
That was after her husband became a chimpanzee.
Or was that before?
Gladys told me so many things.
Aren't you gonna write all this down?
I ran out of paper an hour ago.
- Oh, I can get some more.
- I got writer's cramp.
Oh, do you mind if I have another cup of coffee?
- Right away.
- Is it okay if I use your phone?
- You go right ahead.
- I'd like to call my wife.
She worries about me.
Hello, Charmaine.
Charlie here.
I didn't think it was Rock Hudson.
Look, honey, I'm about to wrap up the wildest case in my whole career.
Boston Blackie has done it again.
I just called to tell you I'd be late tonight.
And what do you expect me to do?
Sit in this dump and watch the wallpaper peel?
What kind of a life do you think this is for me?
I'll tell you what kind of a life it is.
It's a drag.
Now, you'd better get home or it's goodbye, Charlie.
You don't understand.
If I come back to Mr. Barkley with something hot he's liable to put me on a permanent retainer.
Then I can get you them furs and jewels you've always wanted.
Don't give me that jazz.
I'm still trying to get the green off my finger from your wedding ring.
Charmaine, don't give me a hard time.
I've had a rough day.
I've been thrown by a rocking chair and attacked by a soda bottle.
Charlie, do yourself a favour.
Get off the sauce!
I can't wait until Abner comes home so you can tell him what you've seen.
Abner never believed Gladys, you know.
- You do believe her, don't you?
- Look, lady, let me put it this way.
I've got an open mind.
I don't know what's going on over there but my nose smells something weird about her.
My only casserole.
Well Sam, are you sure it was the same man both times?
Positive.
I don't get it.
Why would anyone be interested in you?
I'm sure you don't mean that the way it sounded.
- You know what I mean.
- Yes.
Maybe he was just nosy.
Yeah, but why would anybody be snooping around?
Did anything strange happen when he was in the house?
Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I better call the police, have them keep an eye on the house if he comes back.
I don't think that'll be necessary.
I'm sure we've seen the last of him.
Well, what makes you so sure?
Well Suppose you tell me exactly what happened.
- Suppose I just give you the highlights.
- Why don't you do that.
- The big thing was the baby carriage.
- The baby carriage.
- I made it jump up and down.
- That doesn't sound so bad.
He was under it at the time.
Sam, how many times have I told you Darrin, I don't like anyone sneaking around Tabatha's carriage.
You are right.
And if you see him sneaking around Tabatha or her carriage again you have my permission to use any sort of witchcraft you like.
- Does that make you feel better?
- Much.
Good.
Now, why don't you finish dinner.
- I got about half an hour's work ahead.
- Okay.
- Oh, great.
- What?
I just remembered I left the car outside with the top down.
- You go and work.
I'll do it.
- Don't you think that nose has been overworked today?
- I wasn't gonna use my nose.
- What then?
- My feet.
Feet?
An old-fashioned trick called walking.
Easy when you get the hang of it.
That's my girl.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Okay, baby carriage.
Move.
Pretty please.
Move?
Come on, pretty please.
Pretty please.
I did it!
I did it!
Hi there.
All right.
Just what are you after?
My cat escaped, and I thought I saw it come in here.
- What's your cat's name?
- My cat Oh, Pussy.
Pussy, that's it.
Here, Pussy, Pussy.
Here, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy.
Where are you, Pussy, Pussy, Pussy?
Look, I don't know who you are or what you want but I think I ought to warn you.
If you ever come near this house again some terrible things are gonna happen to you.
Now, look, lady, you better listen to me.
I know who you are, I just ain't sure what you are.
But one thing you better know Charlie Leach is used to all sorts of danger, see?
And nothing you can do can scare me.
- You wanna bet?
- Forget it, lady.
I don't scare easy.
Right now, I'm gonna go out there and call a taxi and go home.
My pussycat may be there by now.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Now get a grip on yourself, kid.
Try to think what James Bond would do in a situation like this.
He'd keep calm, that's what.
So keep calm.
Help!
Help!
Why are you wearing that ridiculous muffler?
Oh, you'd be wearing a muffler too, Mr. Barkley if you had spent all night on a ledge outside of an office 40 stories high.
What were you doing there?
If you let me finish, you'll see the pieces fall together.
At 11:47, I looked into the window of the Stephens' residence and I observed a tiny rocking chair 4 inches tall.
Ten seconds later, I was admitted into the Stephens' residence and now saw the chair full size.
Upon subtle questioning about the change in the size of the chair Mrs. Stephens admitted she, quote, "liked to make things grow," unquote.
Well, my trained investigator's mind put two and two together and I came up with the answer.
- Five?
Sir, I deduced that there was something very queer about Mrs. Stephens.
Until 11:53, when I was left alone with said chair upon which I proceeded to investigate further.
Now, when I lowered my person onto the chair it acted in a very aggressive manner and deliberately threw me to the floor.
At the same time, I was viciously attacked by a soda bottle.
Now, since I had changed my opinion of Miss Kravitz I repaired to her house to further observe the Stephens' residence.
Now, being a man of thoroughness and being trained to disregard physical danger to my person I reentered the Stephens residence at exactly 1: 15 p. M at which time I observed Mrs. Stephens break a dish into numerous pieces and then, with some strange gesture put the pieces into a whole dish again.
And exactly one minute later I was attacked by a baby carriage which pounced up and down on my abdomen causing me great physical anguish.
Well, sir, it was at this point that my suspicions were confirmed.
So are mine, Leach.
So are mine.
Miss Perkins, if Mr. Leach is not out of my office in 10 seconds have the guards evict him!
Go on, admit it.
You blew another job, didn't you?
Got all tanked up and blew it.
Charmaine, I ain't had a belt in three days.
- He just wouldn't listen!
- What did I do to deserve this?
I thought I was marrying Peter Gunn.
Instead I end up with Peter Rabbit.
I ain't no rabbit.
To think, I gave up a promising career in show business for this.
Oh, Charmaine, knock it off.
You was an usherette at the Bijou.
I was second runner-up to Miss Grapefruit of 1956.
I don't wanna dwell on your past glories.
So you wanna talk about my future?
You expect me to spend the rest of my life sitting in this dump?
Look, I know this ain't the Ritz, but it certainly ain't no dump!
Looks like the first act of La Bohème.
- La what?
- La Bohème.
It's an opera, stupid.
I saw it on TV.
That's all I got to do, watch TV.
Boy, some life I got.
Now, look, honey.
I know we ain't exactly living the life of Riley but things are gonna change soon.
I promise you.
You just stick with me, and you're gonna be dripping in mink and jewels.
Sure I will.
You'll get your witch friend to make them out of pumpkins, right?
Charmaine, I swear I saw her do everything I told you she did.
Then you got no problem, have you?
Just get her to witch up all those things you promised me.
- The goose that laid the golden egg!
- What?
- I gotta go out!
- Where?
- To see our goose.
- What?
Charmaine, we got us a goose.
I wish someone would tell me what I'd done to deserve this.
All right, Tabatha.
We'll go for a little ride.
There we are.
And you can stay here Don't go away.
I don't believe it.
Lady, you better believe it.
You better start being nice to me, or you'll be in a lot of trouble.
- May I come in?
- Just who are you anyway?
Let me in for one minute, and I'll tell you.
I figure as soon as you know who I am, you'll see things my way.
- Okay.
You have one minute.
- Thank you.
Hi, kid.
- You stay away from her.
- Take it easy, lady.
There's no reason why you and me can't become real good friends.
I can think of several.
You got it all wrong, lady.
We could become real good friends because we could help each other.
You know, you do something for me, and I do something for you.
Right?
What could you possibly do for me?
Let's start with what you're gonna do for me.
Lady, you're gonna make me a member of the idle rich.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Also, you have used up 30 seconds.
Okay.
I'll get to the point.
I have proof that you're a full-blooded cauldron-stirring witch!
And if you don't give me what I want, I'm gonna blow the whistle on you.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
Last week, Darrin was all set to get a big new account for the agency.
What he didn't know was that the ambitious Mr. Barkley had hired a private detective, Charlie Leach by name to check on Darrin's background and mine.
Darrin passed the test.
But when Mr. Leach check ed with Abner's sister, Harriet she had some rather strange things to say about me.
None of which he believed, of course until he caught me in a weak moment.
When he became a nuisance, and that's putting it mildly I just had to teach him a lesson.
Unfortunately, my problems were just beginning.
Okay.
I'll get to the point.
I have proof that you're a full-blooded cauldron-stirring witch!
And if you don't give me what I want, I'm gonna blow the whistle on you.
What makes you think I'm a witch?
Honey, last night, you put me on a ledge outside an office building You're not gonna try to tell me that you're the typical all-American girl next door.
What if I told you I didn't care if people knew I was a witch?
Well, maybe you don't, but I'll bet your husband does.
Just what do you know about Darrin?
I know everything about him including the fact that he's trying to land the Robbins Baby Food account.
Have I got your interest?
Go on.
And then there's this guy called Barkley who makes all the decisions about who's gonna land the account.
Well, he hired me to investigate the two of you.
You're a private detective?
Now you're catching on.
Shall I go on?
No, I can guess the rest.
You spied on me.
And saw some pretty wild things.
Any questions?
Just one.
How'd you like to be turned into a parrot?
Oh, come on.
I know you're some kind of a witch but nobody can turn a person into a parrot.
Okay.
I believe you.
I believe you.
Boy!
You're some witch.
Exactly.
Now you better get out of here before I turn you into a parrot permanently.
Oh, come on, lady.
You wouldn't do that.
Besides, I don't figure you to be one of them evil witches.
In my job, you gotta be a good judge of character.
I got you figured more like the Glinda, you know the Good Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.
I wouldn't count on it.
You might give me a couple of shots to shake me up but it won't do no good.
By now, you should know I'm a stubborn guy and I'd keep coming back.
Also, I'd hand in that report.
Nobody would believe it.
You want to take that risk?
What do you want?
Well, I'm not a greedy man.
Just do over my apartment, a new car and some new clothes for me and my wife.
And you won't tell anyone?
You won't bother us again?
I wouldn't even tell my wife.
You have my word.
That doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.
- Where do you live?
- Oh, I'll take you there right away.
No.
No, I'll meet you there.
I have to arrange for a babysitter.
It's on the fifth floor.
Hey, after I leave you ain't gonna turn me into a snake or something, are you?
That, Mr. Leach, would be totally redundant.
Charmaine, honey, I'm home.
So, what am I supposed to do, swoon?
Honey, when you hear what I've got to say you may just do that, baby.
You may just do that.
Oh, swell.
You just ruined my whole coiffure.
Charmaine, I've just had the biggest break of my entire career.
- Boy, some life I got.
Can't even go to a hairdresser.
Diamonds and furs, he promises me.
And what do I get?
Broken ends.
So I'll send you to the beauty parlour to have them mended.
Are you kidding?
You couldn't even afford an estimate.
Charmaine, that's what I've been trying to tell you.
We're gonna be very, very rich.
You gonna rob a bank?
No.
I've just been assigned a very important case by a very important client.
You mean some fink is giving you a few bucks to spy on his wife.
As a matter of fact, I'll probably get a very large retainer.
Now, you get out of here.
This client is coming over here to see me.
And it's highly confidential.
Where am I gonna go?
I've seen every movie in town.
Here.
Go to the beauty parlour.
Wait a minute.
This is the rent money.
The old lady's been up three times trying to collect it.
Never mind that.
I told you we're gonna be rolling in dough.
Charlie, you aren't going all funny again, are you?
- Funny?
- Like this morning.
Talking about witches and all.
I was just putting you on.
No.
This is strictly legit.
Now, you go out and enjoy yourself.
When you come back, just be prepared for a big surprise.
You're gonna bless the day that you married Charlie Leach.
You said a surprise, not a miracle.
How did you get here?
I didn't come here to answer silly questions.
Sure, sure.
It's just that I'm a little curious.
Oh, tell me, do you travel sort of like Batman?
Now, look, Mr. Leach, let's get one thing straight.
I don't like you.
And I don't like what you're forcing me to do.
Since I have to spend time with you let's make it as short as possible.
Okay, okay.
You don't have to get so huffy.
After all, you're You're the first witch I've ever known.
What do you want?
Are you gonna do it now?
Tell me, are you gonna put on one of them kooky hats?
Mr. Leach, don't press your luck.
Now, what is it you wanted?
Well, I told you, new furniture for the place new clothes for me and Charmaine and a new car.
Alrighty.
Hey, this is really something.
Would you believe it?
Right out of thin air.
Will I be able to get parts?
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you.
I'd just enjoy driving it.
Boy, I sure will.
Wait a minute, how do I get this out of here?
That's your problem.
Lady, we're five stories high.
You better get this out of here.
I'm a witch, not a parking attendant.
Who is it?
Mrs. Kratz.
And you're two weeks overdue with your rent.
I'll give it to you later.
If you think I'm gonna walk up five flights of stairs again, you're crazy.
Hey, she better not find out about this.
- You gotta do something.
- You're right.
She shouldn't see us together.
That's not what I mean.
Come back.
Come back!
I'm coming in.
No.
No.
Not yet.
And I want that money today, or out you I guess you're wondering what I'm doing on the top of this car.
I was on my way to answer the door.
There's a car in the living room.
Yeah.
It's brand-new.
How do you like it?
This is a fifth floor walk-up.
You got a car in a fifth floor walk-up.
Yeah.
I haven't got a garage for it yet.
How did you get it up them stairs?
Well, I didn't exactly.
I assembled it up here.
Sort of a hobby of mine.
You get this car out of here, or I'll call the police.
Okay, I'll get it out of here.
How?
Gonna drive it down the fire escape?
Let's let me take care of that.
You better.
That's all I need, a do-it-yourself nut.
Okay, where are you?
I bet you disappeared on purpose.
I did it to show you the problems you get into when dealing with a witch.
You sure you don't want to reconsider?
Now, you put this car down the street where it belongs.
That's better.
Now, where's the rest of the stuff?
- What first?
- My new clothes.
You made them too big.
How am I supposed to know your size?
Forty-two tall.
All right.
Hey.
That's better.
Makes me look like a million dollars, huh?
Not even a million dollars could make you look like a million dollars.
What style do you want your apartment?
Expensive.
Boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
You got a lot of taste.
Do you know that?
Thanks.
You made my whole day.
Little lady, I just don't know how to thank you.
I do.
Just never let me see or hear from you again.
Here you are, Mr. Stephens.
Oh, thank you, Betty.
How was Ulcer Gulch?
Did you have a nice lunch?
Well, I had a peculiar lunch, Mr. Stephens.
Maybe I shouldn't be telling you this after all.
I know you're not interested in gossip, even if it concerns you.
That's the only kind of gossip I am interested in.
Please sit down.
Shall I start right at the beginning or jump to the middle?
May as well start at the beginning.
Well, I met Phoebe That's a girlfriend of mine.
Phoebe Perkins, for lunch.
Phoebe works for Mr. Barkley at the Robbins Baby Food Company.
Anyway, I thought I'd find out if you were gonna get the account or not because You thought I'd like to know.
Also, Phoebe has a big mouth, and I thought she'd tell me.
Anyway, I subtly led the conversation around to you and then casually said: "Hey, Phoebe, is your boss gonna give my boss the account"?
Well, that certainly was subtle enough.
What'd she say?
Well, that's where we got to the funny part.
She said it depended on the investigation.
Investigation?
She just let it slip out, but I pounced on it.
Evidently, her boss, Mr. Barkley, thinks that anyone who's going to be associated with Robbins Baby Food should be completely wholesome and normal.
That's why they have a private detective investigate people.
A private detective?
Betty, are you sure of this?
Yes, sir.
Phoebe's a gossip, but she's a reliable gossip.
I can't believe it.
Mr. Robbins seemed like such a nice guy.
I don't know anything about Mr. Robbins but Phoebe says that little fish eyes That's what she calls her boss, Mr. Barkley.
- Is a regular Sherlock.
She told me one poor guy didn't get a job at the company because his wife had worked as a cocktail waitress before they were married.
What did his wife have to do with it?
Oh, the wholesome and normal bit goes for the wife too.
Isn't that silly?
My favourite aunt is a cocktail waitress.
You're right, Betty.
I never heard of anything so ridiculous in - Sam.
- I beg your pardon?
A man has been spying on Sam.
Oh, I wouldn't be upset, Mr. Stephens.
I'm sure she wasn't doing anything she shouldn't.
Oh, my gosh.
When he threatened to hand in that report on me I agreed to do what he wanted.
Honey, that's blackmail!
I know it is, sweetheart, but I didn't want to risk your losing the account.
I don't care about the account.
Don't you realize how underhanded it was for them to spy on us that way?
Well, I did think it was kind of sneaky.
But I thought maybe that's how they did things in your world.
My background didn't exactly include a course in business procedures, you know.
Okay, I can understand that.
But I'm surprised you let him push you around that way.
Honey, when I married you, I made myself a promise.
Never to let my being a witch interfere with your career.
Now, do you understand?
That's why I went along with him.
I'm sorry, honey.
It wasn't your fault.
But I think I should pay a visit to Mr. Robbins and Mr. Barkley.
Why?
Larry and I agreed we wouldn't take the account, even if they offered it.
And I want the satisfaction of telling Robbins and Barkley just that.
- I'm gonna go with you.
- Why?
I want the pleasure of being there when you tell them just that.
Mr. Robbins, I'd like to point out that the graph shows that the trend is very definitely I'm sorry, Mr. Barkley but Mr. Stephens insisted on seeing you right away.
- What are you doing here?
- I have something to get off my chest.
I think that your hiring a private detective to investigate my wife and me is underhanded, unethical and an invasion of privacy.
Because of this, I won't handle your account if you offered it to me!
I don't blame you.
- You don't?
- Lf what you said was true.
Darrin, whatever gave you the idea that we used private detectives?
I hired the detective, Mr. Robbins.
- You did what?
- Just good business practice.
Unfortunately, this particular investigator didn't work out, and I dismissed him.
Oh?
Why did you do that?
Well, if you must know, he came in here with a wild story about you being a sorcerer.
- Sorceress, if you don't mind.
- What?
Well, why use the fancy names when the plain ones will do.
I much prefer the simple old term, witch.
Sam!
Mrs. Stephens, this is no time for levity.
It certainly isn't.
I'd still like to know why you thought it necessary to hire a private detective.
You've got to learn to protect the company.
How did we know that these were Robbins Baby Food people?
Because I happen to like Mr. Stephens.
I also like Mrs. Stephens.
And I don't need any private detective to tell me that.
Well, you're wrong.
You cannot rely on your own judgment.
- Really?
- You hired me, didn't you?
And my ambition is to become president of this company.
That means that somehow I'm going to have to get rid of you.
Why did I say that?
I don't know.
But do go on.
Mr. Robbins, I was only kidding.
Just because I had you investigated too and found out some very interesting things doesn't mean I'm going to use the information.
At least, not until the time is right.
What am I saying?
L I don't know what came over me.
I had this funny feeling.
That's not unusual, Mr. Barkley.
Most people feel strange when they've just been fired.
Mr. Robbins!
Get out.
I know it's impossible, but someone in this room did something to me to make me say those things.
Barkley, will you please leave.
Now, Mr. And Mrs. Stephens if you'll please accept my apologies l'd like to draw up the contract with your company.
Apology accepted.
Here's to the new account.
Something the matter?
There is one thing that bothers me.
It burns me up when I think of Leach getting away with all those things.
Darrin, he doesn't have to get away with it.
You mean, you could get the stuff back?
It could be arranged.
It would only take one short visit with Leach.
I don't know.
I don't like your having anything to do with that man.
Oh, Darrin, please.
Oh, please.
He wouldn't even see me.
- Where'd she go?
- I'm right here.
I made myself invisible, so Leach won't even see me.
I guarantee you he won't bother us again.
May I go?
Honey, I never thought I'd see the day when I'd condone witchcraft.
Go ahead.
Do your worst.
It'll be a pleasure.
Well, how do you like the place?
You just can't get over it, can you?
How much did this guy pay you?
A couple of grand.
A couple of grand?
This stuff must have cost a fortune.
Charlie, you been holding something out on me?
Oh, of course not.
L I just managed to get it cheap, that's all.
From a fence?
Oh, no, this is strictly legit, Charmaine.
You see, this guy happens to run a discount place and he took sort of a liking to me and he managed to give me a deal.
Funny.
It looks like good stuff.
Of course.
It's the best.
Now, would I give you anything shoddy?
Open the champagne, Charlie.
Okay.
Get ready for a big pop.
What's this stuff made of?
Balsa wood?
I don't get it.
You and your cheap deals!
I tell you, it's something Then how do you explain that?
Termites?
It's her!
She's in here somewhere!
I know you're in here!
Where are you?
!
Where?
!
You're out there!
You're out there, aren't you?
Where are you?
I know you're out there!
I knew it.
You've flipped your lid.
If you take this back, I'll report you!
Where are you?
!
Who are you talking to?
!
It's the witch, of course!
You better not mess around with Charlie Leach!
Charmaine, come on!
Hurry up!
Is this your idea of a joke?
She did it again.
- The witch?
- That's right.
Honest.
You gotta believe me.
Charmaine!
Charmaine, come back!
I'm telling the truth!
Charmaine, come back!
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's an Indian giver.
Mr. Leach, haven't you learned your lesson?
I'll give you one more chance.
If you don't give me what I want, I'm gonna hand in that report.
You're bluffing.
I know you've been fired from the Robbins Company.
Okay, I've been fired.
But why don't you give me what I want anyway.
Won't it be a lot easier?
No.
I don't like blackmailers.
I warn you, I'll keep coming back and bugging you until you give me what I want.
And nothing you can do can stop me.
We'll see about that.
As we say in old Mexico Olé!
That ought to hold him for a while.
- Good morning.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- You ready for breakfast?
- You bet.
Who was at the door?
Oh, just a man trying to sell something.
Did you get rid of him?
I don't think he'll be bothering us again.
Good.
Oh, she ain't gonna get rid of me that easy.
When I get back to New York l'm gonna pay that witch lady a visit.
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
Honey, don't forget about Uncle Albert.
According to his telegram, he should be arriving today.
No, I won't forget.
Honey, be especially nice to him.
He's a construction engineer, no family.
- He's on the road all the time.
- Yes, I know.
- I'll make him feel at home.
- Thank you, darling.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Oh, and he is a little eccentric.
If he pulls any of his funny little gags on you, just go along with them.
What funny little gags?
- Well, there he goes.
- Yes.
The typical young American executive on the way to the office.
Same time, same place, every day.
Yeah, you know, a man could set his watch by that, if he had a watch.
Well, time for breakfast.
Shall we meet back here?
- Absolutely, Mr. Dilloway.
- Positively, Mr. Dunn.
- Good morning, miss.
- How did you know I was a miss?
Well, I presume that the laws of this state prohibit marriage for those who are under 21 years of age.
Well, as a matter of fact, I am single.
I'm keeping house for my brother.
His wife's away.
- Oh, I see.
- Are you selling something?
Just the pleasure of my company at breakfast.
Now, I'm not partial to eggs, but some wheat cakes and crisp bacon and lots of hot, strong coffee.
Strong coffee is my weakness.
You're a bum!
This is a respectable neighbourhood.
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!
A man of your age panhandling!
A simple "no" would've been sufficient.
Good morning.
I know.
Don't tell me.
You're Uncle Albert.
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Samantha, Darrin's wife.
He's at the office, but I promised to take care of you.
I hope you don't mind.
Mind?
I'm delighted.
Come in, come in.
My, you were hungry, Uncle Albert.
Yes, travelling always gives me an appetite.
You must lead an interesting life, on the road all the time.
- Oh, you know about that?
- Well, a little.
Most of your work is done in the field, isn't it?
Yes, in the field.
That's right.
Well, that Donald is really a lucky man.
You mean Darrin?
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin.
Yes, of course.
Imagine me forgetting your daddy's name, little fella.
She's a girl, Uncle Albert.
- Tabatha?
- Oh, well Darrin's letter informing me of the birth must've arrived after I left.
My apologies, fair lady.
Apologies accepted.
Now, how would you like to unpack and get settled in your room?
Well, unfortunately, my luggage won't arrive until later.
Some delay at the airport.
However, I would like to wash the dust of the road off this tired old body.
Your room is at the top of the stairs.
I'll show you.
No, no, no.
Now, you sit right there.
I'll find it.
I don't want my stay here to be any trouble to you whatsoever.
Well you like your Great-uncle Albert, huh?
Well, I respect your opinion.
I like him too.
Oh, I didn't know you were there.
My, you do look handsome.
Well, I realized after I took my bath that I didn't have a change.
I hope your husband doesn't mind.
Oh, not at all.
I'm sure if he were here, he'd insist.
- You have a lovely voice.
- Well, thank you.
That was a song I did in my act back in the old vaudeville days.
- You were an entertainer?
- Oh, a headliner.
That's funny.
Darrin never told me.
I wonder why.
Well, that was a long time ago.
I don't believe Darrin would remember that part of my life.
Why'd you give it up?
Well it died, my dear.
I woke up one morning, and it just wasn't there.
And that's when you decided to become a construction engineer.
A construction engineer?
Oh, well, yes, I faced the inevitable.
But really at heart, I'm still an old song-and-dance man.
I bet you could still entertain people in nightclubs and on television.
No, no.
Those days are gone forever, my dear.
When I hung up my straw hat and cane, that was it.
- And I became a - Construction engineer.
Yeah, exactly.
From then on, it was just constructing one engineer after another until I adjusted myself to the new life.
Uncle Albert, would you mind seeing who that is?
Why, certainly.
- Yes?
- Hello, I'm Uncle Albert.
- Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- Pardon?
I said, "Oh, I didn't hear that".
I'm looking for the Stephens, Darrin and Samantha Stephens.
- I believe they're expecting me.
- They moved about two weeks ago.
That's strange.
Darrin never mentioned moving.
Well, I believe his office transferred him unexpectedly.
- They moved to Westport.
- I see.
Do you mind if I use your telephone?
Well, ordinarily I wouldn't but I'm down with a rare case of galloping fungi.
The doctor says it's very contagious.
Well, in that case, I'm sorry to have bothered you.
- Oh, not at all.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Who was it, Uncle Albert?
Oh, just a peddler.
I got rid of him.
Good.
- How did you find me?
- Hey, I saw that lady usher you in like she was expecting you.
How did you do it?
It's a case of mistaken identity.
- She thinks I'm her Uncle Albert.
- It's a case of a gorgeous setup.
Furniture, appliances, silver.
We steal all we can.
Now, look, William, I like this lady and her baby.
Okay.
Them, we don't steal.
You don't understand, William.
I owe her some loyalty.
You wanna talk about loyalty?
For 30 years I carried you into the act.
For 30 years I cooked you mulligan stew.
So until this family goes to bed tonight, you're Uncle Albert.
After that, you're Horace Dilloway of Dilloway and Dunn.
And you're gonna help me load the truck I hire to clean out this joint.
Look, William, can't we try some other place?
No.
Like it says in the sketch, "This must be the place".
Look, Horace, forget loyalty.
Think of responsibility, financial responsibility to certain people.
- Like who?
- Like us.
Your way, if they find out you're not Uncle Albert, it's the clink.
My way, it's Miami and some loot for a change.
Somebody's at the door.
You better go.
- Hi, Miss Kravitz.
- Hi, Mrs. Stephens.
I just came by to return this.
It was in the kitchen.
Abner thinks Gladys borrowed it some time ago.
Thank you, but you needn't have bothered.
Heavens, I know how it is when you run short.
I was saying to Abner just this morning"Abner," I said Miss Kravitz, I'd like you to meet Darrin's Uncle Albert.
It's a pleasure and a privilege, my dear.
Didn't l?
Haven't we met somewhere just recently?
That's not likely.
I've been out of the country for some time and I certainly would've remembered you.
Well, goodbye, Mrs. Stephens.
Nice meeting you, Mr?
Albert, Uncle Albert.
Please, don't be a stranger during my stay here.
Time is so fleeting.
Well, goodbye all.
Well, that was an interesting visit.
Yes, wasn't it?
And we are developing a crash program to present to Mr. Martin.
It's my considered opinion that he should Mr. Stephens' office.
Oh, sure.
Hi.
Just a second.
It's Mrs. Stephens.
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm up to my ears.
Did Uncle Albert get there all right?
Yes, yes, he arrived just after you left.
- How do you like him?
- Fine.
I like him just fine.
Well, you don't sound very enthusiastic.
Well, Darrin, you remember you mentioned those little things he does?
Well, he only does them for laughs, even though he's not very good.
Well, I think he's very good at them.
Has he pulled the one about the mouse in his pocket yet?
No, but he's pulled the one about Harriet Kravitz's wristwatch.
Listen, I forgot to tell you.
There's a photograph of Uncle Albert in the bottom drawer of the desk in the living room.
It might be nice if we had it out on display.
Well, all right, sweetheart.
Oh, look, I just wanted to ask you if I'm sorry, honey, I've gotta get going on this Martin thing.
I might be a little later than I thought.
Try to amuse Uncle Albert till I get there, will you?
All right, I'll try.
- Thanks, sweetheart.
Bye.
- Bye.
Now, where were we?
It was right here.
"In my opinion, it's" Would you get that, Betty?
Mr. Stephens' office.
Oh, I see.
Well, just a minute.
Let me check with him.
It's Mr. Martin's office.
They wanna postpone the meeting until 11 tomorrow morning.
Tell them yes!
Yes, tomorrow will be fine.
Oh, well, thank you.
Okay, goodbye.
Now, would you like for me to read the memo back to you?
No, we can do it first thing tomorrow morning.
I think I'll go home and surprise my Uncle Albert.
I tell you, I was wearing it when I went in this house, and that man stole it.
- Harriet, you don't know for sure.
- Oh, I don't, don't I?
You'll see.
- Oh, hi there, Miss Kravitz.
- Yes, it's me again.
Where is he?
- Won't you come in too, Mr. Kravitz?
- Thank you.
- There he is.
- Well, Miss Kravitz.
To what do we owe the pleasure of this visit?
To a certain item taken from my person by a certain party.
Don't pretend you don't know.
Well, I'm afraid you do have me at a disadvantage.
You see, I've just come back from a long, long trip and, well, my mind is still a little fuzzy.
- Well, let me enlighten you.
- Harriet, please.
I happen to be talking about my wristwatch.
You mean the one you're wearing, Miss Kravitz?
Yeah, that's the one, all right.
Oh, boy, I'm sorry, Mrs. Stephens.
I was not wearing that a few minutes ago.
Harriet, please, you need glasses.
I've told you since you fell out of the tree house when you were 6.
Goodbye, Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye, Mr. Kravitz.
Well, another interesting visit from the Kravitzes.
I wonder why that nice lady thought I stole her watch.
Perhaps because you did.
- Pardon?
- Oh, come on.
I was standing right here when you did it.
Oh, you were?
Now, Darrin's told me all about you, Uncle Albert.
This was another one of your funny little tricks, wasn't it?
Oh, yes, yes, it was one of my funny little tricks.
But I still don't understand how she got it out of my pocket.
Do you?
- How?
- That's one of my funny little tricks.
Now, you have a request for an encore from Tabatha.
- Do you mind?
- Oh, that'll be a pleasure.
Holy Toledo.
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, hi.
I wanted to surprise my Uncle Albert.
Darrin, I thought you were supposed to work late tonight.
- The meeting was postponed.
- Oh, it was?
Darrin.
- There he is.
I see him.
- Darrin.
He's sitting there reading my newspaper.
Isn't he great?
- Darrin.
- What?
- He's not your uncle.
- What?
He's only pretending because I made the mistake in the first place.
What mistake?
You see, I thought he was your Uncle Albert, so I invited him in.
He's really a very nice man.
I like him.
Tabatha likes him.
- You'll like him.
- Hold it, hold it, hold it!
What happened to my Uncle Albert?
You know, I've been wondering about that myself.
Anyway, you'll enjoy this Uncle Albert.
I asked him to stay overnight.
You did?
Why?
Because I'd already invited him.
I thought I'd explained.
You see, I thought he was Uncle Albert.
That doesn't make any sense.
- He's wearing my suit.
- Yes.
Doesn't it look nice?
Does he know that you know he's not Uncle Albert?
No.
Oh, Darrin, please, please.
Go along with it, just for tonight.
- Sam - Please?
You - You must be Donald.
- Darrin.
And you must be my Uncle Albert.
It's no wonder you look surprised.
You probably don't even recognize me.
After all, it's been years.
Well, last time you saw me, I was probably that high.
- Maybe even that high.
- Yes.
- You've changed a bit yourself.
- Well, time does change one.
- It's great to have you here.
- Oh, thank you.
- Well, why don't we have a drink.
- All right.
Then after dinner, we can We can kick around old times.
It was marvellous the way he warmed up to you when you were talking about the old days.
Yeah.
I never knew I'd gone to a burlesque show when I was only 6 years old.
You were marvellous.
- You're not bad yourself.
- Well, thank you.
Sleep well.
- That's it.
That's all we can carry.
- Now, wait.
- For what?
- I can't go through with it.
- Are you gonna start that again?
- They were so wonderful to me.
You should've been in there at dinner tonight.
You bet I should've been in there.
The sooner we get rid of this, the sooner I can buy my dinner.
Like in Miami Beach, Florida.
They really made me feel like somebody.
Yeah.
The somebody they made you feel was Uncle Albert.
How will they make you feel when they know you're Uncle Horace?
- I know.
- Come on, come on, let's get going.
- What is it?
- I think your hobo friend hit the road.
Well?
Oh, Darrin.
I was so sure he'd turn over a new leaf.
Honey, he's obviously been at it a long time.
With him, you'd have to uproot the whole tree.
- Well, I guess I better call the police.
- Police?
Is that absolutely necessary?
Have you got any better ideas?
As if I didn't know.
Hey, what can I do to make you crack a smile?
- It's a lost cause.
- Yeah.
You'll change your mind when I turn this into eating money.
We can bum a year on what we got back here.
Hey, I wonder if this is real silver.
It could be worth a lot of dough.
Hey, wait a minute.
Let me see that.
"To Darrin from Uncle Albert".
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no" what?
They knew.
They knew I wasn't Uncle Albert all the time.
Hey, wait a minute.
What are you doing?
- I'm going back.
- Oh, no chance, pal.
You wanna go back, get out and walk.
All right.
- You know you're breaking up the act.
- Unless you wanna stick with me.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do that.
Absolutely, Mr. Dilloway?
Positively, Mr. Dunn.
All right, you've had your fun.
Now, you just kindly turn around and come back.
What's that?
These things don't belong to you.
Just bring them back.
You're wasting your time and mine.
Yeah?
What happens if I turn you off?
- I must be losing my mind.
- No, not really.
Just do as I tell you.
Yeah, lady.
All right.
Honey, they couldn't have swiped the phone, could they?
It's right down there.
Thanks.
We're gonna have to call the police.
Oh, darling, I don't think that'll be necessary.
Our furniture's on its way back and Uncle Albert will be knocking at the door any second.
Really?
Why do I even ask?
May I come in?
Hello, Uncle Albert.
Glad you decided to come back.
Samantha, I'm not your Uncle Albert.
I'm a tramp.
And you both knew it right from the beginning.
Why didn't you throw me out?
Because we liked having you here.
That'll be the police.
Well, I guess I had it coming to me.
Well, it's not the police.
It's the truck you left in.
William?
He's back here?
Let's just say he delivered the truck.
You know where to find him later.
You're not gonna have me arrested?
My wife thinks you can turn over a new leaf and get a job.
Maybe the suit will bring you good luck.
I can keep it?
Why not?
Well, I don't know how to thank you.
Maybe I can get a job and really be somebody.
You are somebody.
You're Horace Dilloway of Dilloway and Dunn.
Now you can go back to entertaining people in nightclubs and on television.
Oh, no.
No chance.
Nobody has any use for us these days.
And I say they do.
You think it's possible?
Mr. Dilloway, when my wife says it's possible, believe me, it's possible.
How did you know my name?
That's just another one of my funny little tricks.
Well, I'll be in touch with you if you'll let me.
We'll be looking for you.
Good night, Darrin, and thank you very much.
Good night, Mr. Dilloway.
Good night, Samantha.
Good night, Uncle Horace.
I told you everything would be all right.
You'll see.
Dilloway and Dunn are gonna be headliners again.
I wasn't worried about them.
I was thinking about lugging all that furniture back into the house tonight.
Darrin why don't you let me do it for you.
Sam, this is some kind of a record.
For the second time in one night l'm not gonna argue with you.
Wait for me.
What took you so long?
- Hey, I just thought of it.
- What?
Whatever happened to my Uncle Albert?
Oh, well, I wouldn't worry about him.
He's probably busy constructing engineers.
Come on.
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
My, you look fetching.
Oh, hello, Mother.
Do you like it?
It's new.
Divine.
It's a bit chic for the suburbs though, isn't it?
Darrin and I are going to a dinner dance at the country club with the Tates tonight.
- What brings you here?
- No particular reason.
You're going to a dinner, I thought I might help.
- Help?
- You have four mice and a pumpkin around?
I have already met my Prince Charming.
Oh, there he is now.
Mother Some Prince Charming.
I'm afraid you and I see him two different ways, Mother.
That's true.
I don't know why you can't see him as he really is.
Like this: - Mother.
- But you persist seeing him like this: You're wrong on both counts.
I see him as he really is.
Like this: Good.
I knew you'd leave him some day.
- Leave who?
- Your husband.
See how easy it was?
You've forgotten already.
Mother, I'm not leaving Darrin.
We're going to Florida together.
Again?
Darrin has the week off.
His parents picked up Tabatha.
They're going to look after her.
This time tomorrow we'll be sunning ourselves - Oh, yes.
If my memory serves me, you've postponed that beautiful fantasy six times.
What makes you think this is the lucky seven?
He gave me his word.
Nothing short of a catastrophe can delay us now.
Darrin, you're just the man who can help us avoid a catastrophe.
Larry, I was just on my way out.
Darrin, this is Sanford Stern of Stern Chemicals in from Pittsburgh.
Darrin Stephens.
- A pleasure.
- I'd like to chat but I have a plane to catch.
- Jim was just taken to the hospital with appendicitis.
- Send him candy in my name.
I'll write him a card from Miami.
Darrin, it's painful for me to have to tell you this.
Then for Pete's sake, don't do it.
Just don't do it.
- You'll have to cancel your plans.
- You had to do it.
I'm afraid I'm the villain, Mr. Stephens.
But my hands are tied.
I have a TV deadline for my commercials.
I know how hard you've been working.
If anybody deserved a vacation it's you.
You've given service above and beyond All right, all right.
All right, Larry, I can't bear having a grown man cry.
- I wasn't going to cry.
- I meant me.
Thanks, old pal.
I'll leave you two together.
- You want me to call Samantha?
- No, I'll do it.
Just be nice to her at her murder trial.
- What?
- After she's killed me.
Oh, thank you, darling.
I appreciate how you're taking this.
You sounded a little strained over the phone.
I can't stay mad at you for long.
I've forgotten all about it.
Well, I have to get back to work.
That reminds me, I have some unpacking to do.
See you later.
I do hate to say "I told you so," Samantha.
Really?
Since when?
Oh, cheer up, my sweet.
You haven't missed much.
It's not much fun going to Miami with an old sobersides like Desmond.
You have the wrong idea about Darrin.
You can only see one side of him.
I know he has another.
He can be witty and charming and just full of fun.
Well It's a pity you can't take the fun side of him and leave the work side at home.
You're a big help.
There's no sense in feeling sorry for myself.
Darrin can't go, and that is that.
Except for the unpacking.
Sam!
Samantha!
Fore!
- Is anything the matter?
- No.
I'm three feet from the cup.
I hear those courses in Miami are great.
- I can hardly wait to play them.
- Miami?
You didn't cancel the tickets, did you?
No.
No, not yet.
But you said we weren't going.
All systems are now go, go, go!
Fore!
Darrin, what about the Stern Chemical account?
Didn't you say you had more work to do on it?
Work?
I never heard of it.
Why don't you let me take you out of all this?
- What about Larry and Mr. Stern?
- Oh, let them get their own girls.
I thought you said they had a deadline for those commercials.
You know, I've been thinking about that for about the last 10 seconds.
- I've come up with the solution.
- You have?
Yeah.
The heck with them.
Now, to more serious affairs.
Where's my suntan oil?
- Don't you think you - I'll tell you what I think.
I think you have the most incredible green eyes I've ever seen.
We were talking about the account.
Answer the following questions with "yes," "no" or "sometimes".
- Do we deserve a little fun out of life?
- Yeah.
Have I been promising you this vacation for months?
- Yeah.
- Do you love me and will you follow me wherever I go?
- Are we going to Miami?
- We are.
- You want to hear your score?
- I have to repack the stuff I unpacked.
I'll do that.
You find my suntan oil.
- One more thing.
- What?
You have the most incredible green eyes I've ever seen.
I know, I know.
Well Now, if I were a bottle of suntan lotion, where would I be?
- Is this what you're looking for?
- Oh, thank you, Mother.
Now it's my turn to say "I told you so".
I can hardly believe that Derrick is anything but a sober stuffed shirt.
Mother, I am in love with a charming man who loves fun and excitement.
Well, I just hope your husband doesn't find out.
Honey, have you seen my book on how to surf?
Yes.
I think it's in the den.
See what I mean?
- You're not going in there.
- Why not?
Well, it isn't the proper place for a book on surfing.
That's where he keeps all his books.
I'll only be a minute, honey.
As soon as I find Darrin?
Darrin, what are you doing in here?
Darrin.
Samantha, please, I was trying to concentrate.
What are you concentrating on?
The Stern Chemical account.
Jim DeWitt got sick, and Larry asked me if I wouldn't take - Haven't I been through this before?
- Yes, you certainly have.
Why am I going through it again?
Darrin, you just went upstairs to pack.
I did?
What gave you that idea?
I got the idea when you said, "I'm going up to pack".
Samantha, this is no time to play games.
The agency is relying on me to come up with an effective campaign.
- I only have three weeks - Just a minute.
Have you been here ever since I was here?
Of course.
Then you Your brother.
What did you call me?
Do you feel any different?
Different than what?
Never mind.
You just go ahead and finish your work.
I'll take care of my mother.
The meddler!
Mother, I want to talk to you.
Did you find the book you were looking for, darling?
No.
But I found something else.
- What's that?
- My husband.
- Oh, darling, you can't win them all.
- At least one of my husbands.
The other one is upstairs.
Now, admit it, Mother.
You divided Darrin.
Oh, don't be so upset, Samantha.
I did it in your best interests.
Darrin will be furious.
I admit that made it irresistible.
I only want one Darrin.
I know exactly what you mean.
It's humiliating to look as if you've made the same mistake twice.
Samantha?
Samantha, who is that singing?
The radio upstairs.
It is very distracting when you are trying to concentrate.
I have a great deal of work to do, you know.
- I'll turn it off.
- Thank you.
Nice voice, though.
- Mother!
- Oh, come on, Samantha.
I just wanted to see if you were right about David's two personalities.
You were.
Good.
Now, how about putting him back together?
Oh, very well.
But really, what's the harm?
If he works as hard as you say he does at least half of him deserves a rest.
That's very peculiar logic.
Well, that's because it's so sensible.
Well?
Well Sam, I can't find my swimming trunks!
It isn't as if you won't be with your husband.
You'll simply have the fun side of him.
In your closet, bottom shelf.
Listen to him.
He's actually enjoying himself.
He does sound happy.
Well, half a rest is better than none.
I suppose.
- Will you take him?
- Now, Mother, I haven't said that yet.
How am I going to explain this to the Darrin in the den?
Well, it's all very simple.
Tell him you're coming with me.
Well, now, Mother, he'd never agree to that.
Well, why don't you try it?
I think it's a wonderful idea.
Just because I'm chained to my desk doesn't mean you have to stay and be my warden.
Besides, it'll give you a chance to rest and me a chance to work.
You go with your mother and have a good time.
Mother, he told me to go and have a good time.
Do you think what we're doing is right?
Absolutely.
What can happen?
Hi, Endora.
My, you look ravishing tonight.
I like him better this way.
Come on, we're wasting all that sunshine.
Let's live it up a little.
- Boy, are you happy.
- And why not?
You're looking at a man with only one responsibility in the world.
- What's that?
- To have fun, fun, fun!
The main objective of the campaign will be to acquaint the average person with the significance of chemicals and particularly Stern Chemicals, upon his everyday life.
That's excellent, Darrin.
First-rate.
I'm sure you'll find it satisfactory once you've heard the rest of my ideas.
I like it now.
Look, we've been at this for 16 hours now.
I suggest we celebrate our progress by going out to dinner.
Hear, hear.
Well, we do have a lot more work to do.
I think we should call it a day.
Look, I don't get to the big city very often.
What do you say we cut loose and have some fun?
That reminds me.
I've written a small booklet entitled Let's Have Fun With Chemicals.
Darrin, Mr. Stern is hungry.
Well, I suppose we could have something sent in.
Now, here I've outlined how we'll acquaint the general public with your actual products.
Darrin, you don't have to knock yourself out like this.
You've already got the contract.
I know that, Mr. Stern.
But we do have the responsibility of coming up with an effective campaign.
- Darrin, Mr. Stern was making a joke.
- All right.
Just a figure of speech.
Oh, yes.
That leads me to another phase of the campaign.
I believe that you should take a look at these market research figures.
He's certainly a hard worker, isn't he?
Yeah.
But doesn't he ever get any fun out of life?
Thank you.
Now, this is going to be fun.
Now, everybody, all together.
The last line.
Go!
Isn't that terrible?
Oh, he's so witty and charming.
Isn't he funny?
He's a laugh a minute.
Come on, Sam, let's Watusi.
I'll sit this one out, if you don't mind.
- You're not gonna poop out on me?
- You're a little hard to keep up with.
Yeah, I know.
I'm having a ball.
Hi, Joe!
He's a real fun guy, Joe.
They're all fun people.
- Sure you don't want to dance?
- No, thanks.
I'll call home in a minute and find out how your mother is making out with Tabatha.
- Who?
- Tabatha, your daughter.
- I'm sure she's fine.
- Hi, Francie.
- Hi, Darrin.
- She's got a great personality.
- I'm a little worried about her.
- Francie?
- Tabatha.
Honey, I like Tabatha too, but you can't let your children run your life.
Don't worry.
Give you wrinkles.
I'm sure your mother and father are taking good care of her.
But after all, we do have a responsibility.
Honey, honey, honey.
Only one responsibility: Fun, fun, fun.
Hey, look, Joe is going off the board.
Great dive, Joe!
- Excuse me a minute.
- Darrin Fun, fun, fun.
Hey, watch this everybody!
Darrin.
Darrin, you can't swim!
Front flip into the pool and back again?
Thank you, my friends.
It was really nothing.
Now I have an announcement to make.
It's party time!
Everyone, to our room for a party!
I feel guilty.
I should be back at the office working.
Darrin, will you relax?
You've been like a one-man factory all day.
That is another angle to consider.
We should make a film about the factory.
Show the folks at home some of the research you're doing in a fun sort of way, of course.
Isn't there some kind of button you can push that'll turn him off?
Drink up, Darrin.
And forget about chemistry, huh?
You can't really forget about chemistry.
It's in the air we breathe.
This salt and pepper shaker, ashtray, table.
- Fascinating.
- Yes, it is.
That's why I believe this campaign will work.
First of all, we show the public the phenomenon and then we interest them in your product.
You know, after dinner, I'd like to go to a couple of nightclubs.
Great.
They have a marvellous new chorus line at the Purple Popsicle.
Oh, they also have a new comic.
Funny.
Very different.
Sort of low pressure.
That's exactly my point.
- What?
- A low-pressure campaign.
While we're waiting for our food, why don't I show you more ideas I have?
Darrin, you're kidding.
I doubt it.
He's not the kind of a man that kids very much.
I don't get it.
Usually he has a great sense of humour.
Sure, a barrel of laughs.
No, really.
You've only seen one side of him.
Well, I hope he finds the other side soon.
- It's a great party, huh?
- Yeah.
Hey, honey, we're all out of champagne.
Well, we'll order another magnum.
Better still, a "magni".
That's two magnums.
You just leave it to old Dar.
Darrin, at the risk of sounding like a nagging wife, can we afford all this?
- Well, we'll just dip into our savings.
- We can't do that.
Hey, you're right.
I got a better idea.
Why don't you twitch your nose and whap up some champagne?
You want me to use witchcraft?
Why not?
I mean, it'll be crazy.
The gang will love it.
They'll be crazy about it.
They'll get a big kick out of it.
But, Darrin, you can't tell them I'm a witch.
Why not?
They'll love it, love it, love it!
- Darrin!
- I'll quiet them down while you do it.
- Darrin!
- Hey.
Hey, gang!
Hey, folks!
Where did everyone go?
Back to their rooms.
But, honey, we were having such fun.
Darrin, we have something to tell you.
- "We"?
- Yes.
Mother?
My, looks like quite a party.
- Hi, Endora.
Great to see you, baby.
- Oh, thank you.
Mother, I want the man I married back.
But he's charming this way.
Yes, charming, witty and totally irresponsible.
But this is his best side.
Don't you like him this way?
Well, I like ice cream, but I don't want to eat it all the time.
- Girls, you just lost me.
- Yes, we certainly did.
Darrin, will you please sit down?
Please?
Now, I know this may be I realize this may be rather hard for you to understand but only part of you is here the fun side.
Without a care in the world.
I love her sense of humour.
The other half is at home.
Okay, I'll bite.
What's he doing?
Well, I hate to think.
But I'd better find out.
Thought she'd never leave.
So much for the TV campaign.
Now, let me tell you what I had in mind for the radio spots.
This boy reminds me of Horatio Alger.
A boring Horatio Alger.
- Darrin.
- Sam.
- This is Sanford Stern.
- Samantha, what are you doing here?
You're supposed to be in Miami.
Yes.
Do you mind if I borrow my husband for a moment?
- Oh, please do.
- Oh, please do.
- We have to be going anyway, right?
- Yes, we've monopolized your time.
But But We were right in the middle of a business discussion.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Of course I am, but not when I'm talking business.
I have to get them back.
Hey, wait a minute.
- Where am I?
- You're in Miami.
Who is he?
That's not "he," that's you.
What are you doing here with my wife?
I knew we shouldn't have invited him.
We were having a cool time until he showed up.
I thought you were going with your mother.
She came with me.
Look, you've got some explaining to do, buster.
Who do you think you are?
Boys, boys.
Will you please tell me who this is?
Really, you are dense.
It's very simple.
This is your other half.
- Other half?
- Pleased to meet you.
Will you please get to the point?
I've got about a ton of work to do.
Darrin, this is the point.
We thought you needed a rest so we thought we'd take your fun side on vacation.
- Fun side?
- Hi, work side.
Will you stop grinning at me like an idiot.
I don't think there's anything funny about this at all.
Absolutely no sense of humour.
Mother, will you hurry and put them back together?
Lt'd help if they liked each other a bit.
- Never happen.
- Mother.
Well, separating them was easier, you know.
But putting them back together may be more difficult.
Will you stop talking about me as if I were some do-it-yourself kit?
- What a grouch.
- There is a way to get them back.
- But I'm not sure they'd like it.
- What's that?
They both stand at opposite ends of the room and then run into each other.
- Sounds like fun.
- Are you out of your mind?
Now, there's no need to be rude to Darrin, Darrin.
After all, he's my husband too.
I'm not even sure that's legal.
Sam, I've had enough of this nonsense Darrin, you want to get back to work, right?
I certainly do.
And you want to go back to the party, right?
Crazy.
Okay.
First one out the door gets his wish.
Is he back together again?
Yes, dear.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin, speak to me.
Oh, I'm mad about that outfit.
Sam?
- It's nice to see you, sweetheart.
- Oh, Mother, he's back to normal.
That, my gal, is a matter of opinion.
Well, it was an interesting experiment.
At least you had a vacation out of it.
Some vacation.
At least I learned an important lesson.
I can't stand Darrin's work side.
And I can't stand his fun side either.
Stars and comets.
You've finally seen the light.
It's the whole Darrin I love.
I've never heard such blatant, sticky sentimentality in my whole life.
I never want him to be anyone else.
I think I'll leave before I get sick.
Oh, hi, honey.
Hi.
My, it's nice to have you back.
All of you.
- You've got all of me for three weeks.
- How?
Larry was so pleased with my work on the Stern account he gave me a vacation.
- Larry is right.
- You deserve a vacation.
- The word he used was "needed".
Anyway, I know where I want to spend it.
- Where?
- Right here.
Just the four of us.
The four of us?
You, Tabatha, my fun side and my work side.
That's the best vacation I ever heard of.
{END OF EPISODE 33}{START OF EPISODE 34}
Careful.
My husband hasn't left yet.
I'm not gonna fall for that.
I happen to know you're crazy about me.
- It shows, huh?
- The feeling's mutual.
And that is one reason why we're going to celebrate tomorrow night.
What's the other reason?
I was going to save this as a surprise for you tomorrow night but I may as well show it to you now.
A calendar.
Just what I've always wanted.
You haven't seen the best part yet.
A calendar with the days crossed off.
That's even better.
Honey, it's what those crosses represent that counts.
Sam, you haven't done any witchcraft for 29 days.
- You finally noticed.
- Yeah.
I'm very proud of you.
We have another reason for a celebration.
Not only have you not twitched for 29 days but we haven't seen any of your witchy friends in that time either.
- No offence.
- None taken.
I got a little head start on that when Mother said she was gonna go skin diving for a month.
Good.
Now, all you have to do is protect your record for good behaviour for two more days.
I'll try and keep my nose clean.
I'll see you tonight.
Samantha, you're still a vision of loveliness.
I don't know you.
What are you doing in my kitchen?
Don't fret, my dear.
I have a feeling we're gonna make a lovely couple.
I have a feeling I'm gonna blow my record.
Just who are you?
My favourite food.
Chocolate cake.
You haven't answered my question.
Well, actually, there's no reason why you should recognize me.
When you used to sit with me, I was a callow youth.
Brilliant, but callow.
Babysit with you.
Wait a minute.
You're not Rodney?
The same.
I lost my callow.
You mean you're that pushy, spoiled, neurotic brat my mother used to force me to look after?
Knew you hadn't forgotten.
Fortunately, I matured with my neuroses intact.
That's what makes me so fascinating.
Now, look, Rodney I happen to be very busy.
So would you mind telling me why you're here?
Well, even as an adolescent, I loved you, Samantha.
- Oh, really - In a repressed way, of course.
Could I have a little more chocolate cake?
Make it yourself.
That's mean and cruel of you, Samantha.
You're trying to hurt me.
Take your chocolate cake and get out.
Good.
Why won't you come away with me?
If I tell you, will you leave?
- Perhaps.
- I think you're obnoxious.
Oh, one of those love-hate things, huh?
That's okay.
I'm crazy about complex relationships.
Rodney, don't you understand?
I'm married.
I'm above convention.
And I have a baby.
No.
That's out of the question.
We'll put her up for adoption.
Rodney, if you don't go away l'll tell your mother on you.
You don't know where she is.
- Do you?
- I'll tell her you've been misbehaving, Rodney.
Okay, have it your way.
We'll take the kid with us.
Rodney, I've had just about all I can take.
Samantha, I love you.
I worship the air you fly in.
- I'll do anything for you.
- Anything?
Then leave.
Good.
Honey, we have a visitor.
- Who?
- Come and see.
I found him outside.
He just wouldn't leave.
Oh, Darrin, he's marvellous.
Oh, he's so cute.
I wonder who he belongs to?
Well, I don't know.
He doesn't have any tag or Look at that.
Looks like a case of love at first sight between you two.
I guess we'll have to take out an ad in the lost-and-found column.
- I guess so.
- You sound reluctant.
Honey, if nobody claims him, would you mind if we kept him?
I thought you wanted to wait till we got a bigger place before we got a dog.
- Well, I did.
But I'm crazy about his personality.
Aren't you?
Well, he does have a great face.
And who could resist those big, brown eyes?
Let's keep our fingers crossed that nobody claims him.
How would you like to fix me a drink while I go upstairs and fiddle with my papers?
- What are wives for?
Thank you.
Now, you stay right here and get to know my wife.
You'll be crazy about her.
I just fixed that cake for tomorrow night.
Rodney?
That's you, isn't it?
You get out of that fur coat right this minute.
Now, just what are you doing here?
Oh, Samantha.
My love for you is not warped and selfish.
I wanted to get to know your husband.
If I think he's worthy of you l'll leave by tomorrow morning.
Believe me.
If you don't leave right now l'm going to tell Darrin who you are.
- No, you won't.
You don't want him to know there were any non-mortals in the house.
That would spoil your record and his celebration.
Hey, he's really crazy about me, isn't he?
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna hit you with this saucepan.
You come a step further, I'll turn into a dog.
You wouldn't hit a dumb animal, would you?
Oh, Rodney Sam, what are you doing?
You weren't gonna hit him, were you?
He ate my chocolate cake.
Well, honey, don't be too hard on him.
He's probably hungry.
Look, I'll pick you up another cake tomorrow at Perkin's Pastry Shop.
I'll bring it home from work.
I better clean this up.
Hi.
Hey, he sure is affectionate, isn't he?
He fawns a little too much.
- Fawns?
- Yes.
You know, all that licking and grovelling.
- Well, honey, he's very friendly but I wouldn't call that grovelling, would you?
He tries a little bit too hard to please, that's all.
I brought your drink in, sweetheart.
- Thanks.
I'll have it later.
- You don't like him.
Darrin, I hardly know him.
I just don't want you to get too fond of him, that's all.
- Why not?
- Well I just don't want you to get too attached to him.
I wouldn't want you to be disappointed.
- Disappointed?
- In case his owner claims him, I mean.
Oh, honey, you're the greatest.
What is the matter with you?
Darrin, I don't think we should be doing this in front of him.
The dog?
Well, he's looking at us kind of funny.
What shall we drink to?
Well, that's easy.
To one month of normalcy.
- Sure means a lot to you, doesn't it?
- Yes, it does.
- And the first month is the hardest.
- Oh, boy.
Just remember, it's all kind of psychological.
If you get past this one day, it'll be a breeze.
Well, I'll try not to disappoint you.
- You take good care of him, honey.
- You can rely on it.
I phoned the ad in last night and left my office number.
I hope nobody calls to claim him.
Well, thank you.
What did I do to deserve such a big kiss?
Nothing.
Harriet Kravitz is spying on us from across the street.
I thought we might as well give her her money's worth.
I'll see you tonight, sweetheart.
Goodbye, dog.
Rodney.
Rodney!
Rodney.
I'm not leaving.
I've decided he's not worthy of you.
Rodney, when are you going to get it through that pointed little head that we love each other?
Is that the only reason you have for not leaving him for me?
Isn't that enough?
Coming, Tabatha.
But if you had a fight and you split up, then you'd come with me.
For the last time, we are not going to split up.
What makes you so sure?
I'm interested.
We have a marriage that's based on mutual trust and respect.
If I proved that wasn't true, then you'd come with me?
Rodney, I am going upstairs to get Tabatha and if you're not gone when I come back down here l'm going to do something terrible to you.
And ruin your record?
Oh, I don't need witchcraft.
I'll punch you in the nose.
Just what I need.
Phase one of Operation Split-Up coming up.
Oh, I'm Harriet Kravitz from across the street.
Hi, honey.
I found this in the kitchen.
I guess Gladys borrowed it from Mrs. Stephens.
I'll take it.
Sam's slipping into something more comfortable.
We're gonna have a little snort together.
Are you a friend of Mr. Stephens?
Well, more a friend of Sam's.
Listen, honey, I'd love to gab but I'm kind of busy right now.
Know what I mean?
- Bye.
- Bye.
Mutual trust indeed.
Phase two of Operation Split-Up coming up.
Rodney.
Rodney?
Well, Tabatha, looks like our home-wrecking friend finally got the message and gave up, huh?
Are you sure it's the same dog, Mr. Entwhistle?
The description in the ad sounded just like him.
He's very friendly and Oh, yes, he He loves chocolate cake.
That's him all right.
You sound disappointed.
Well, I've grown very fond of that dog.
Truthfully, I was hoping nobody would claim him so that we could keep him.
Well, perhaps that might be arranged.
Yes.
My sister and I are moving to London soon.
I'd hate to lose him, but it would be difficult to take him with us.
- Would you be willing to sell him?
- Well, look l'm meeting my sister at 7 for dinner.
Let me talk it over with her, and I'll drop by your house later tonight and tell you our decision.
- Good.
I hope you can convince her.
That dog is really something special, Mr. Entwhistle.
Yes.
Well, you're very perceptive, Mr. Stephens.
It's the strangest thing.
I suddenly had this terrific craving for chocolate éclairs.
I mean, I just had to have a chocolate éclair.
Isn't that odd?
I think that happens to all of us at sometime or another, Ms. Kravitz.
I suppose Mrs. Stephens asked you to stop by and pick up something for your company.
- Company?
- I met him quite by accident.
Unfortunately, I called at a very bad time.
He was still in his robe and pyjamas when he answered the door.
He said they were just having a snort together.
- Is he a friend of yours, Mr. Stephens?
- I don't know.
I suppose someone dropped in, and Sam hasn't had time to tell me.
Well, I must say your faith in your wife is very touching, Mr. Stephens.
Miss Kravitz.
Aren't you going to buy some éclairs?
Éclairs?
I hate éclairs.
In fact, I don't even know why I came in here.
Hi, there.
Oh, no.
Now, listen, Rodney no more Mrs. Nice Guy.
When Darrin comes home, I'm gonna tell him exactly who you are.
And I'm warning you, he can be very violent.
No, you don't wanna spoil your record when you're so close.
Besides, you have my solemn oath that if you are still together by 9:00 tonight l'll fly out of your lives forever.
Still together?
Did you put a spell on Darrin?
Oh, Samantha, you know my powers are too meagre to cause a rift between you two by witchcraft.
I just wanna be around you for another Is that too much to ask?
Honey, open the door.
I've got my hands full.
My master's voice.
Just a minute, sweetheart.
Thank you.
Hey, it's nice to have someone like you welcome me when I get home.
Nice to have someone like you welcome me.
Not necessarily in that order, I hope.
No.
I just think you look sensational.
- I brought dessert.
- Thank you.
Dinner should be ready in a little while.
Good.
Just the two of us?
Well, this was our celebration.
Didn't you wanna be alone?
Oh, sure.
It's just that sometimes friends drop in unexpectedly, that's all.
No.
No, no friends.
You want a snort?
Drink?
Love one.
So you've just been puttering around the house on your own, huh?
Darrin, I think there's something I should tell you.
I thought so.
You've just mixed 4 ounces of Scotch with 2 ounces of gin.
- Is that all?
- No.
When you wanna find out something from me, just ask.
Not very subtle, huh?
Okay.
I bumped into Harriet Kravitz today and she said that you and a man in a dressing gown were having a snort together.
Well, that's ridiculous.
- Then it's not true?
- No.
Then why would she say it?
I don't know.
Honey, don't misunderstand me.
I trust you implicitly.
It's just that I do get a bit confused.
Now, are you sure that there wasn't a man here today in his pyjamas and robe?
Darrin, that isn't exactly the kind of thing that would slip my mind.
Did she say she actually saw us?
She said the man answered the door, and he said What is it?
Well, Darrin, I wasn't gonna tell you this.
And I don't think you're gonna like it, but Honey, I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation.
Now, who was he?
Him.
The dog?
In pyjamas and robe?
Okay, very funny.
Now, who was he?
No.
Darrin, it was the dog.
I didn't wanna tell you, because I didn't wanna spoil our celebration.
Actually, he's a warlock I used to babysit with.
- The dog?
- He came to see me yesterday morning.
I know it sounds ridiculous, but he thinks he's in love with me.
The dog?
Darrin, I'm trying to tell you that that is not a dog.
He just posed as a lost dog.
That's why I didn't want you to send that ad in because I knew nobody would claim him.
Because he's a warlock?
Darrin, I'm telling the truth.
Look, I'll prove it.
All right, Rodney, he knows.
Change back.
Oh, he's just being stubborn.
Stop playing games, Rodney.
Turn back.
He knows I won't use any witchcraft on him.
Rodney, if you don't turn back right this minute l'll hit you with my shoe.
- Sam, you'll scare him.
Right out of his hide, I hope.
Sam, don't you think it would be easier just to tell the truth?
Darrin, don't you believe me?
No, I don't.
I happen to know that dog is not a warlock.
- How?
- Because his owner came to my office this afternoon.
- What?
- And he's a very nice young man.
He may even sell me this dog.
Oh, Darrin, don't you see?
- That's Rodney too.
- Yes, I do see.
You want me to believe that this poor, helpless animal is your friend a dog and his owner, all at the same time.
Well, Darrin, Rodney's very devious.
Sam, aren't you being unfair?
- Unfair?
- You're trying to put the blame on this dog because you don't like him.
Don't deny it.
You never did like him.
You even said that he fawned.
- You don't trust me.
- Yes, I do trust you.
I just resent your trying to blame this poor, innocent animal.
Now, will you please tell me the truth?
I'm not going to tell you anything.
I don't even wanna speak to you.
Well, in that case, I'm going to bed.
I don't care what you do.
In the den.
Come on, fella.
Bed?
It's only 8:30.
Imagine her trying to put the blame on a poor dog like you.
Well, looks like I need an extra blanket.
I'll go get it.
You just make yourself comfortable.
Boy, am I beat.
I'm gonna fall asleep just as soon as my head hits that pillow.
Good night, dog.
- I got you!
- No, don't hit me.
Samantha!
Don't hit me.
Samantha!
Well, well.
What do you think of man's best friend now?
Never mind what he thinks of me.
- What about what he thinks of you?
- Stay out of this.
You said your marriage was based on mutual trust and respect.
I proved you were wrong.
He didn't believe you were telling the truth.
Yes, I did.
- You did?
- Yes.
Just once, I wanted to win out over witchcraft without any help from you.
Besides, I didn't want you to spoil your record.
- He's lying.
- That's why I went to bed at 8:30.
You don't know how happy I am to hear you say that.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Pardon me.
Does this mean that you're not coming away with me?
Sam, will you excuse me for just a minute?
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm gonna punch you in the nose.
How long is he going to stay this way?
It's just one of his old tricks.
He knows you won't hit a dumb animal.
I'm going to call the pound.
That won't work.
Mr. Stephens?
I saw your ad.
I've come to claim my dog.
Well, I think there must be some mistake.
Oh, no mistake.
I recognized the description.
There he is.
Now, Rodney, you come out of there.
- Rodney?
- This is Rodney's mother, darling.
You may not remember me.
I'm Samantha.
Samantha?
My, how you've changed.
Oh, he's lonely, you know?
He's always looking for a playmate.
- So I gather.
- He's not really bad.
He's just mischievous.
How are you gonna get him to change back?
Oh, that's easy.
Rodney, if you don't change back l'll give you a flea-and-tick bath.
Come on, Rodney, it's way past your bedtime.
Goodbye, my love.
I shall return.
- Oh, no, you won't.
- Don't bother to show us out.
Goodbye, now.
Would've loved to have seen that tick-and-flea bath.
Well, you still think I'm entitled to a celebration?
You didn't use witchcraft.
Well, with him gone, we really have something to celebrate.
I'll drink to that.
Sam, water.
Oh, Sam.
- What?
- You broke your record.
Well, there's always next month.
{END OF EPISODE 34}{START OF EPISODE 35}
- You tired, honey?
- I'm exhausted.
- How about you?
- Not a bit.
I'm still keyed up from the party tonight.
I was pretty funny, huh?
Yes.
Well, now, you relax and try and get some sleep, huh?
Okay.
Darrin.
Darrin, you left your light on.
Darrin.
Darrin.
Darrin?
You're snoring.
That's okay, honey.
I don't mind.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
Ready for breakfast?
I'll have to pass, honey.
No time.
Darrin, do you have to dash off every morning without breakfast?
You've hardly been home for dinner either.
I've barely seen you.
I know.
But I have to have the entire cosmetic campaign ready for that big sales meeting tomorrow morning.
I have to be in town this afternoon.
Maybe we can meet for lunch.
I'm having lunch with one of the execs of the cosmetic company.
Some guy named Tony Devlin.
Perhaps we could meet for a midnight snack sometime, stranger.
I'll eat my lonely breakfast in lonely silence and try to be brave.
Go now, and don't look back.
I have been neglecting you, haven't I?
I tell you what, no matter how much work I have to do tonight l'll forget about it and come on home and have dinner with you.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye-bye.
- May I join you, dear?
- Hi, Mother.
Your mortal roommate seems to be getting the seven-year itch five years early.
What do you mean by that remark?
When a husband starts working nights that's a different story.
Mother, don't you let your suspicious little imagination run away with him.
Seven-year itch, indeed.
But it doesn't have to be an out-and-out itch.
All it takes is a little rash.
Do you mind if we change the subject?
Now, look, I have to go shopping in town, so why don't you come and then we'll have lunch together.
- Oh, splendid.
Let's go to some place really chic, and dress to the nine.
Like it?
Perfect.
They're both witches.
Charlie Leach, private eye, you've really got it made now.
Charmaine, honey.
Sweetheart.
Your loved one is home.
Did I wake you, honey?
No, I'm all dressed up for the senior prom.
Baby, I've got some great news.
You can go right back to sleep after I tell you all about it, huh?
No.
Just having you home makes me too excited to sleep.
I only see you 26 hours a day.
Baby, our problems are over.
Something sensational happened.
We were finally accepted on relief?
Oh, I know things have been tough up to now, Charmaine but I'm onto something real big.
And you're gonna have diamonds, a fur, a car a yacht and a mansion.
What?
And leave all this?
Oh, I ain't kidding.
It's just that I gotta figure out one little angle.
Yeah, how to get the money direct from the mint and eliminate the middleman.
No, I'm serious, honey.
Do you remember a few weeks ago I was doing a little snooping I mean, investigating for this baby food company?
Yeah.
And I also remember they fired you for all that crazy talk about witches and black magic.
The only kind of job you can hold from that kind of talk is a social director at a funny farm.
Oh, I was only kidding about that.
I've been doing some investigating on my own and I've got some information that's gonna be worth a fortune.
You and me are gonna be rolling in dough.
Charlie, I don't need to be rolling in dough.
Right now I'd settle for you getting a job that lasts past lunch.
- Darrin.
- Yeah, Larry?
Meet Toni Devlin of United Cosmetics.
I'll be right with you, Mr. Devlin.
- Oh, excuse me, Miss Devlin.
- Made the same mistake myself.
It's Toni with an "I," not with a "Y".
This is Darrin Stephens.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Now, if you'll excuse me.
- Won't you sit down, Miss Devlin.
- Thank you.
I was just going over the art layout for the campaign.
I'll have the final ones ready tomorrow morning.
Mr. Stephens, I hope my being a woman won't cause us a problem in working together.
Of course not.
Why should it?
We'll get along just fine as long as we keep it strictly business.
I'm not the least bit interested in the flirtatious little games between the sexes.
I hope I make myself clear.
Oh, yeah, crystal clear.
Let me say something, Miss Devlin: Aren't you being a trifle presumptuous?
I'm merely going by the track record in this business.
Then let me be the record breaker.
I happen to be a happily married man.
I have a lovely wife and daughter and, no offence intended, but I do find you resistible.
I deserved that.
Forgive me.
- Friends?
- Friends.
May we go to lunch now?
Frankly, I'm starved.
- Okay.
But I'm warning you, lady - About what?
After lunch, I'm bringing you back to this office to show you my etchings.
Mother, I haven't been here in ages.
Not since Darrin and I were dating.
We used to call it "our place".
Oh, that's a man for you.
When they're chasing you there's always some dear, little romantic "our place".
And after they catch you "our place" is in the kitchen, with Laundromat privileges.
- Samantha.
- What is it?
Look at that.
This was a favourite spot of Samantha's and mine when we were dating.
We used to call it "our place".
Kind of corny, huh?
But sweet.
You really are in love with her, aren't you?
She is out of this world.
Well, so what, Mother.
Darrin said he was gonna have a business lunch with Toni Devlin.
He didn't say that Toni plucked his eyebrows, did he?
I'm sure it's nothing more than what he said, a business lunch.
Oh, Samantha, he really has you brainwashed.
Why?
Because I trust him?
I don't mind you trusting him, just don't put so much faith in that trust.
Now, for once, listen to me, and let's get out of here.
No, I am not sneaking out like an eavesdropping wife.
If you don't go, I'm going to do something terrible to him.
I mean it.
This time, I'll really turn him into a frog, forever.
You wouldn't.
He already has a big mouth.
Mother, stop trying to stir up trouble.
Darrin said he'd be home for dinner, and he will.
He'll have some last-minute excuse.
- Sam, I'm home!
- The voice of treason.
- Samantha!
- In here, darling.
- Mother, try and be pleasant to him.
- Am I ever anything else?
Oh, hi, Endora.
- Just passing through?
- What?
- Hi.
I made your favourite roast.
- Shame it'll go to waste.
Why should it go to waste?
You always eat enough for three.
Well, I'm going upstairs to get washed and kiss our gorgeous daughter then I'll be right down.
Boy, that looks good, and I'm hungry.
Any questions?
Something will come up.
You'll see.
Like, he left the lights on at the office or he had to go back and wax the floors because the janitor got sick.
And why didn't he mention anything about that woman at lunch?
There was no need to.
The woman was a client, nothing more.
Excuse me.
- Hello.
You must be Mrs. Stephens.
- Yes.
I'm Toni Devlin, a business associate of your husband.
- Oh, come in, please.
- Thank you.
- I don't like this - Mother.
This is my mother, Endora.
Toni Devlin.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I'm sorry to bother you, but I have to discuss some campaign changes with Darrin before our meeting tomorrow.
Well, I don't blame you.
This campaign is pretty obvious.
If you'll just have a seat, I'll get Darrin.
Samantha, this is really the limit.
That That hussy, walking right into your home flaunting herself in your face.
Mother, she seems very nice.
And she hasn't made flaunt one.
If you won't do anything about it, I will.
Mother, you change her back right now.
I will not.
And she stays this way until you come to your senses.
Goodbye.
Mother.
Mother!
Honey, where'd you get the cat?
Oh, she just wandered by.
- It's a cute cat.
- Yeah.
Why don't we have some hors d'oeuvres?
Why don't we.
It seems we're not having that thing for dinner that always upsets my stomach.
- What's that?
- Your mother.
No offence.
But she did leave, didn't she?
Oh, yes, she left.
Is something wrong?
You always have that special look on your face when something's wrong.
- Darrin.
- Yeah?
Promise you won't get mad?
I promise.
What?
Oh, no!
Darrin, you promised you wouldn't get mad.
I am not mad, I'm furious!
Look, l Honestly, I never mistrusted you for a moment.
You shouldn't have.
You didn't have any reason to.
Well, don't just stand there.
Let's give Miss Devlin some milk.
Here, kitty, kitty.
Here, Miss Devlin Oh, no!
She's gone.
What am I gonna do now?
I have to have her at that meeting tomorrow.
That cat is chairman of the board.
Darrin.
Darrin, here, drink some coffee.
It'll calm you down.
Over 12 hours and not a single word.
Some police force we've got.
They can't even find a stray cat.
But if that cat double-parked, wham, they'd find it.
I'll get it.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Larry.
Have you talked with Miss Devlin today?
Miss Devlin?
No.
Why?
I tired to reach her.
They said she didn't get back to her hotel.
I hope there's nothing wrong.
Oh, I'm sure there's nothing wrong, Larry.
She did say something to me about visiting her aunt or something.
We'll see her at the meeting then.
Sure, Larry.
Don't worry, I'll see you soon.
Bye.
We've gotta find her in time for that meeting.
We've got to find Mother so that she can change that cat back into Miss Devlin.
Sam, what if Miss Devlin got ahold of some bad garbage and is lying sick in an alley somewhere?
I'll get it.
You drink this.
Good morning, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, no, not you again.
Charlie Leach, private eye, in person.
Who is it, honey?
Your friendly neighbourhood blackmailer.
What do we have to do to get rid of you send you to the moon in a rocket?
- I can do it without the rocket.
You don't frighten Charlie Leach with your witchcraft.
I know the magic word: C-A-T.
I do believe that I have a wonderful proposition that would be mutually beneficial.
- Okay, make it fast.
- In a word I have the little lady with four legs and a tail and in a safe place.
Being the generous soul that I am l'm willing to share my good fortune with you.
She's all yours.
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.
You hand me a million dollars cash, and I hand you the cat.
A million dollars?
Are you out of your skull?
- Where would I get a million dollars?
- In her nose.
All she has to do is wiggle it, right?
Oh, yeah.
And I'm also willing to forget the fact that you and your old lady are both witches.
Now, isn't that a generous gesture?
- You're all heart.
- So?
I'm afraid he's got us, honey.
Make with the nose.
Okay.
But my powers are limited, you know.
I can't produce that much money all at once.
Well, you better figure out something fast otherwise you'll never see that lady with the furry face no more.
Figure, Sam.
Figure.
- I've got it.
- What?
- A money tree.
- Yeah, a money tree.
- A money tree?
- A money tree.
A money tree?
Wow, a hundred dollars.
I do believe I have died and gone to the great savings and loan in the sky.
Hey, wait a minute.
There are only ten bills.
A thousand dollars.
Our deal was for a million dollars.
Now, what about it?
What about it?
It blooms a new batch every 24 hours.
Yeah.
Now may we please have our cat?
Yeah, in 24 hours.
If this thing works.
Well, I can't wait that long.
That cat has to be at a meeting at 11:00.
That's fair enough, Mr. Leach.
One thing, though.
Would you please feed her promptly at 9:30?
- It's very important.
- 9:30.
- And this thing better work.
- Oh, don't worry, it will.
- Bye.
- Bye.
- You sure you know what you're doing?
- Oh, yes.
Positive.
- Then do one thing.
- What?
Let me know.
Charmaine!
Honey.
Sweetheart.
Your lover-boy is home.
What is it with you and anyone sleeping past the crack of dawn?
Honey, this is worth waking up for.
At night, he won't take me dancing.
In the morning, he loves it.
I'll take you dancing every night.
As a matter of fact, I'll buy you your own dance hall.
Now, just feast your eyes on that.
You roll me out of a sound sleep to look at a bush?
Listen to you.
A bush, you say?
You're begging for a fat lip, Charlie.
Honey, this is no ordinary bush.
This is a money tree.
- Money tree.
- Yeah.
Charlie, it's too early for the bars to open.
You back to sniffing lighter fluid again?
Cookie-face, I mean it.
This is a money tree.
It grows hundred-dollar bills.
- Hundred-dollar bills.
- Yeah.
And it grows a new batch every 24 hours.
I guess it sounds sort of crazy, huh?
It should.
The words came from a crazy place.
You'll see.
You'll see.
Excuse me, I gotta go and feed the cat.
- What cat?
- A very special cat.
This cat goes to meetings.
What did I do to deserve this?
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Here, miss.
I hope you liked mackerel when you were a lady.
Honey, if your witchcraft ever worked, it had better work now.
We witches are very reliable.
He should be feeding her right this minute.
Honey.
Don't you think that's enough?
He's just supposed to feed the cat breakfast, not be it.
Herbs and spices, suet and fat Change the rodent back into that rat Don't scratch me!
Thank goodness.
Oh, that horrible mackerel breath.
On your mark, get set, go.
One, two, three, four, five six, seven, eight, nine - Ten.
- Hello, Mr. Leach.
Yes, and my wife will do it again if you don't bring that cat back.
Yes, I'll wait for you.
Goodbye.
He's bringing the cat right over.
Thank you.
Take her to the office.
I'll call you there.
I'll see if I can find Mother.
You be careful.
Don't worry.
Remember, I was flying before I could walk.
- Good morning, Larry.
- Darrin, I don't like it.
We'd better call the police.
Miss Devlin's just disappeared.
I'm sure she'll show up.
We have a few minutes before the meeting.
How can you be so calm?
And what are you doing with that stupid cat?
Larry, please don't talk that way in front of the cat.
- What?
- Well, it's a nice cat.
Have you flipped?
A client is missing, and all you're worried about is that dumb animal.
Larry, please.
Not in front of the cat.
- Yes.
- Would you tell Mr. Tate the gentlemen have arrived for the meeting?
Thank you.
I'll try and stall them.
Change, already.
Change!
- Well, any word?
- I'm afraid not.
There's no choice but to start the meeting and tell them what happened.
Yes.
Mr. Stephens, there's a long-distance call for you from Tibet.
Tibet?
Will you excuse us Me, for a minute, Larry?
Yeah.
- Hello.
- Hello, Darrin?
I found her in Tibet.
She came to have tea with the Lord High Lama.
Just in time too.
What?
Okay, put her on.
Mak e the cat that woman again That did it, honey.
Come on home.
Where am I?
We'd better get to the meeting.
Meeting?
For some reason, I feel so strange.
It's commonly called a hangover.
- We had a pretty big night last night.
- We did?
- Yes, we did.
- Boy, never again.
- Larry?
- Yes?
- Miss Devlin.
I didn't see you come in.
- She used the back door.
By the way, who was that on the phone from Tibet?
Wrong number.
Wrong number?
Leaves!
Leaves!
Nothing but leaves!
I've been duped!
They promised me that this would grow money this morning.
Charlie, you didn't really mean that jazz about the hundred-dollar bills?
I sure did, and I'll prove it to you.
I picked a whole batch of them yesterday and put them in my wallet.
Now, here, you go out and buy something real nice for yourself.
Gee, I don't know how to thank you.
Oh, I'll get them for this.
They ain't seen the last of Charlie Leach yet.
My luck, I haven't either.
{END OF EPISODE 35}{START OF EPISODE 36}
Samantha!
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
L I didn't expect you home so early.
That's pretty obvious.
Is this the kind of thing that goes on behind my back all the time?
- No.
Now, Darrin I broke that vase, and it's a present from your Uncle Albert.
So I thought You thought you'd just ring-a-ding-ding your nose and put everything together again.
Sam, you're getting to be more witch than wife.
You knew I was a witch when you married me.
No, I didn't.
You didn't tell me until our wedding night, if you'll remember.
- Darrin.
- What?
I wonder about that sometimes.
If I had told you I was a witch, would you have still married me?
Well, yeah.
Sure, yeah, of course.
Thank you.
That's very broad-minded of you.
- Come on, Sam.
I said I would, didn't I?
- Not very convincingly.
How can anyone be sure of a thing like that?
I am reasonably certain.
I mean, I'm practically positive.
Yes, I would.
Okay?
Okay.
Well, I'm going to go upstairs and say hello to the baby.
You do that.
Yeah.
Well, that was sweet and tender.
- Hi, Mother.
- There is a way to find out whether he would've married you or not.
You'd like to know whether he would've proposed to you if you told him you were a witch.
I can put you back in the past so you can find out.
Oh, no, Mother.
Darrin's angry enough.
- I wouldn't want to upset him any more.
- He won't be.
He'll go back in time, and when he returns, he'll never remember a thing.
Now, Mother, this is between Darrin and me.
So will you please change the subject?
Why, of course, dear.
You know, the weather is very lovely on the Riviera this season.
You owe yourself a trip, Samantha.
Mother, you don't believe Darrin would've proposed to me, right?
And there's such an interesting group of people there.
There's a young, divine Italian director and there's that crazy French novelist - Mother.
- No, I don't think whatchamacallit would've married you.
Well, you're wrong.
There always will be a doubt, won't there?
I suppose so.
And when you look across the breakfast table at him you'll wonder what would've happened if Oh, let me send you back, Samantha.
Well, all right, Mother.
You win.
Good.
Now, sometime in the past you're going to tell him you're a witch.
When do you think that would've been?
Well, there was the time I went to cook dinner in his apartment.
I almost told him then, before he proposed.
Well, that sounds very, very good.
- Now, Mother, no nonsense.
- No, no, no.
When you go back to the past, it'll be exactly as it would've been.
Now, then, come here.
Thunder, lightning, rain, hail Backward, turn backward Oh, time, in thy flight Let her find out What would happen that night - Yes?
- Mr. Stephens?
Oh, yes, I am.
How about that.
I'm your friendly cosmetic lady and we're introducing a new kind of kiss-proof lipstick.
I'd like to leave you a sample.
Oh, well It's a marvellous product.
I'll take all you have.
You look beautiful.
You're just saying that because you're handsome.
Well, here we are.
Yes, I guess I am.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
To you.
I'm sorry.
L I meant for this evening to be special but I didn't mean for it to be that special.
Darrin, this is sort of a special evening for me too.
You see, there's something I have to tell you.
- Bet I can guess what it is.
- You couldn't possibly.
You forgot to bring the things for the dinner you're gonna cook.
Right?
No.
No, you'll have your dinner.
I can whip up a dinner out of nothing.
Well, that's just what we've got in my refrigerator.
Nothing.
No, it's something about me I really think you should know.
- I know all I need to know about you.
- I don't think so.
It's about my family.
We're different.
Samantha, I'm not interested in your family.
I'm interested in you.
I wouldn't care if they were shoplifters, moonshiners or cattle rustlers.
If it were only that simple.
Darrin, I think you better sit down.
Okay.
You love me, don't you?
Been doing my best to give you that impression.
Well, here goes.
Darrin, I'm a witch.
Well, nobody's perfect.
No, no, I'm serious.
I am a witch.
Well, what makes you say that?
No, I mean I am.
I'm a house-haunting, cauldron-stirring, broom-riding witch.
I'll tell you what we're going to do.
I'll take you out to a nice restaurant.
We're going to have dinner, and after dinner l'll take you to a very funny movie.
How'd you like that?
I told you we could have dinner here.
I think it might be a better idea if we had dinner at a restaurant.
Well, if you don't believe me I guess I'll just have to prove it.
Careful, hot plate.
That is hot.
Well, if you don't like roast beef maybe you'd like a turkey dinner.
- You're a witch!
- Yes, Darrin.
I mean, you really are a witch.
Were you born that way?
Mother's a witch, Father's a warlock.
- I see.
- Now that you know does it make any difference?
No.
No, no, no.
Of course not.
Why should it?
I mean, what's the difference?
Well, who cares about a little thing like that?
Oh, Darrin.
Don't touch me!
Oh, how chicken!
Well, now you know.
Oh, boy, do I know.
- Oh, boy.
- Well, it's nice to be sure.
It clears up all your doubts.
Walking out on me, from his own apartment.
- Coward!
- What?
- Oh, Darrin.
- What is this all about?
- Whatever it is, you're responsible.
- Oh, tish-tosh.
He doesn't remember.
You remember the night I came to your apartment to cook dinner?
Well, of course I remember.
Well, this time I told you I was a witch and you behaved very badly.
- I did?
- You ran out on me.
L Well, that's understandable.
Oh, yes, very understandable.
You see what I mean?
Well, I came back, didn't I?
Didn't I?
Well, I don't know.
We didn't go that far.
You didn't go that That's not fair.
You didn't give me a chance.
That wasn't necessary.
Your attitude was obvious.
Narrow-minded, intolerant, middle-class, superstitious All right, Mother.
That will do.
Darrin's right.
- We didn't give him a chance.
- Oh, my poor baby.
Where did I go wrong?
Where did I fail you?
Now, cut that out.
Sam, I love you.
If this cuckoo experiment is upsetting you I demand the right to go back and prove myself.
That's only fair.
Mother send us back.
You sure?
I'm sure.
All right.
Thunder, lightning, hail, rain Backward, turn backward Oh, time, in thy flight Both of them go back And you'll see that I'm right You're a red-blooded American boy, and you're in love with a witch.
She's a beautiful witch, and you're in love with her.
Darrin, here are my layouts for the salad-oil campaign.
Just pour them on the desk, Larry.
Please, Darrin, no jokes about the accounts.
- Sorry, Larry.
- Hey, wasn't your girlfriend gonna cook dinner last night?
- How'd it go?
- Please, no jokes about my love life.
- Sorry, Darrin.
But she's beautiful.
What do you care if she can cook or not?
Oh, she can cook.
She can do anything.
Then what's the problem?
Larry, I had the shock of my life last night.
I've got to tell somebody.
- Yeah?
- Samantha is - No, you'd never believe me.
- Of course I'll believe you.
Go on.
- You'd never believe me.
- I'll believe you.
- Tell me.
- You'd never believe me.
- Try me.
- She's a witch!
Darrin, take it from an old married man.
All women are witches.
If you love her, and she loves you, what's the difference?
But she's a "witch" witch.
W-l-T-C-H.
Come off it, Darrin.
If you want a vacation just ask for it!
- She's a witch!
If you keep on with this fruitcake routine you'll have a permanent vacation.
- Lf she were here she'd tell you she's a witch.
- Is that what you really want?
- It certainly is!
What is the matter with you?
Samantha, I'd like you to meet my boss, Larry Tate.
Charmed.
I I mean, I'm I'm enchanted.
How about bewitched, Mr. Tate?
I Well, I didn't mean to - No offence.
- None taken.
Samantha, thank you for popping in.
Oh, don't mention it.
And now I'll just disappear the way you did last night.
Tell me if an advertiser were trying to decide between McMann & Tate and another agency, could she make him choose us?
Certainly.
And if we drew up a campaign for him could she influence him, so He'd be crazy about it.
How marvellous.
Marvellous!
Well, now that I'm no longer needed That girl is just what we need.
The trouble is, I love her.
The possibilities!
The possibilities.
Despite the possibilities, gotta have that girl.
I want that girl on our team.
I'd love to team up with that girl.
I'll work out the details, and talk to you later.
Don't worry, you won't regret it.
I know, she's a wonderful girl.
Oh, fine, fine, fine.
You're a red-blooded American boy, and you're in love with a witch.
Hello, Samantha.
It's Darrin.
Don't hang up.
Honey, I've been miserable without you.
I miss you.
I wanna see you.
I wanna talk to you.
Samantha?
Samantha Oh, honey, I love you.
And I love you.
I'm sorry I reacted the way I did.
No.
Now, sweetheart, it was my fault.
I just didn't find the right way of telling you about me.
Maybe I shouldn't have.
No, no.
You were right.
I had to find out sooner or later.
You see, not many of our people have fallen in love with humans before and, well, I just didn't have a precedent to go on.
You come with me.
- Samantha.
- Yes, Darrin?
You're the most important thing that ever happened to me.
I'm glad.
I look into the future, I can't even imagine it without you.
I feel the same way.
Well, I know I don't make a great deal of money but I'm sure I'll be making a lot more soon, and Darrin, is this a proposal?
It's supposed to be, but will you help me?
- I've never done this before.
- Well, I have an idea.
What?
Why don't you just say, "Will you marry me"?
That's it.
- Samantha.
- Yes, Darrin.
There's someone at the door.
Go ahead.
Okay.
- Good evening, Darrin.
- Larry.
Hello, Samantha.
I'm glad you're here.
- Larry - Bear with me for a moment.
I've got something wonderful worked out for you two lovebirds.
Well, thank you I think this is gonna be a marvellous marriage.
- We're gonna get along beautifully.
- We?
I've been giving this a lot of thought.
You know, we can't miss.
Samantha, the way you can influence a client will make us the biggest agency in the world.
- Now, just a minute.
- I know what you're thinking.
And don't worry.
I'm going to make Darrin a vice president with a big increase in salary.
- I see.
That's why you told me you were gonna be making more money.
No, Samantha.
I don't know anything about this.
Of course you do.
We discussed it in your office.
- When?
- After Samantha left.
We shook hands on it.
Well, I hope you two will be very happy together.
Wait a minute.
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy!
- Did you have a nice trip, darling?
- He would've used me.
You would've had me putting spells on clients.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You and Larry Tate were ready to cash in on my witchcraft.
- Does Larry know?
- Don't worry.
He won't remember any more than you do.
- Good.
- Oh, Darrin, how could you?
- How could I what?
- Well, I trusted you.
I was ready to give up everything for you.
Mother warned me about human men, but I thought you were different.
I am.
I mean, I was.
I mean, I would've been.
You!
You are responsible for all this!
Everything was fine until you came in here and stirred up the cauldron.
This is my house.
You're not welcome and I want you out of here on the next broom.
Just a minute.
That is my mother, and you cannot talk to her that way.
It may be your mother, but it's my mother-in-law and that makes her a horse of a different colour.
Did I hear you correctly?
Did you call my mother a horse?
She's all mother-in-law and a yard wide.
A yard wide?
How dare you!
Make that 2 yards.
Darrin, I never realized how cruel and thoughtless and rude you could be.
I'm still pitching with a cold arm.
Wait till I get warmed up.
Be thankful I didn't meet her before I proposed to you.
Oh, what a terrible thing to say.
What a terrible thing to say!
Well, now you know, darling.
He's showing his true colours.
Oh, boy, do I know.
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
Oh, boy!
You witches think you're so different.
Well, you're acting just like any ordinary run-of-the-mill, human mother and daughter.
Oh, come on, Samantha.
Take the baby and come home to Mother.
There's no reason to put up with this any longer.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
Samantha and the baby are not leaving except over my unconscious body.
Well, what could be fairer than that?
Well, it's all for the best.
Well, he is my husband.
Well, let's not quibble about technicalities.
Technicalities?
He's the father of your grandchild.
But you've already seen that he never would've married you.
You've been pulling that hanky-panky behind my back.
Now, Samantha, you know that I love you.
I always have loved you.
If you take me back, I'll prove it to you.
- You're not afraid?
- Not a bit.
- Mother.
- What?
- Send us back.
- Send us back.
Oh, hemlock.
Thunder, lightning, hail, rain Backward, turn backward Oh, time, in thy flight Again, send them back And out of my sight - Now, wait a minute!
- Yes?
I didn't have anything to do with this idea.
No, I take the full credit for him.
But think what this would mean, Samantha.
With the judicious use of your powers you two could be the wealthiest couple in the country.
You wouldn't be exactly poverty-stricken yourself, would you?
I think I would be entitled to a modest amount of fallout, shall we say for having had the inspiration.
Well, that's it.
I've given you the bare bones of the idea.
Of course, we'll have to flesh it out a little.
Larry, take your bones and get out of here.
- Out!
- What's the matter with you?
You sore I want a piece of the action?
There won't be any action.
Of all the greedy, underhanded schemes that is the worst.
I won't let you or anybody else take advantage of Sam!
I don't like your attitude.
Remember who signs your paychecks.
Not anymore you don't, buddy boy.
Find yourself another boy.
Now, you get out of here before I throw you out!
How about that!
Oh, Darrin, you were wonderful.
Any success I make in the business world, I'll make on my own.
I want you to promise that you won't ever use that power of yours to help me in any way.
I'll do my best.
Now, where were we?
Ah, yes.
Sit down.
I was just telling you how promising my financial future was and Oh, boy.
We'll skip that part.
Now, what were you going to say before we were interrupted?
We are not going to be interrupted again.
I'm not going to let anybody through that door.
Mother!
How dare you come crashing in here.
- He was about to propose.
- Forgive me, darling.
I thought he'd like to meet your mother first.
- It's the acid test, you know.
- Oh, you're - Sam - Darrin - Dear, I'd like you to meet my mother.
- Mother?
Yes.
This is my mother.
How do you do?
Any mother of Samantha's is a mother of Oh, he's so human.
That's out of the question.
Come on, Samantha.
I'm going to take you right home.
- May I say something?
- Must you?
I know this must come as a great shock to you.
It must be just as difficult for you to adjust to as it was for me.
Not difficult at all.
- Good.
- It's impossible.
Are you coming, Samantha?
Mother, I love him.
Why, he isn't even good-looking.
I think he's adorable.
Well, that settles that.
- He'll be back.
- Don't you help him.
I won't have to.
I don't care what you do to me you can't keep me away from Samantha.
No?
Now, Mother, you stop that.
Oh, Samantha, you're just a silly little child.
I won't stand by and see you make a fool of yourself.
Okay, Mom, knock it off!
Mom?
Oh, how disgusting!
You'll just have to get used to it.
Daughter or not, you can't talk that way to the girl I'm going to marry.
- Darrin, is that a proposal?
- I've had enough interruptions!
Will you marry me, yes or no?
!
Those are the sweetest words I ever heard.
Will you answer me!
Oh, yes.
- I guess I made it, huh?
- You sure did.
Isn't that sickening?
Not to us, it isn't.
You both acted just like children.
Don't you think it's just a little bit childish not to admit when you're wrong?
Don't be a bad sport, Mom.
Well, I am.
Mother, put that chair back!
{END OF EPISODE 36}{START OF EPISODE 37}
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Hi.
Still in love with that coat?
What coat?
It's been open to that same page for the last three days.
Oh, that's the centre page.
It opens there naturally.
- How long for the pancakes?
- Just a few minutes.
Well l'll finish getting dressed.
Mother?
Mother, I can't wear this coat.
Yes, you're right, Samantha.
The colour isn't very becoming to you.
Oh, that's perfect.
Mother.
I know, I know.
I don't understand, but I know.
I will have a mink coat when Darrin can afford it, and not before.
Well, by the time Darwin can afford a mink, mink will be extinct.
Now, be honest with yourself, Samantha.
Wouldn't you adore to have that coat?
Well Wear it in good health.
Mother.
You take back this coat.
- Hi.
- Hi.
It's crazy, but I've been looking at that picture of that mink coat for so long, I could've sworn you were just wearing one.
Darrin would you like to tell me what's bothering you?
I don't know, honey.
L I don't seem to be getting anywhere.
I've been doing pretty much the same job for the last three years and what have I accomplished?
Sweetheart, I think you accomplished a great deal.
Like what?
Well, look around you.
We're not exactly starving, you know.
Well, honey, I know we have most of the things we need but just having the things you need isn't everything.
I mean I'd like to buy you some things you haven't got.
I've got you.
That's the only thing I really want.
What about that fur coat?
Oh, Darrin, I haven't heard you talk this way before.
Remember the new account I told you about?
Waterhouse and Company?
The one the agency's been trying to get for years?
Yes.
Oh, don't tell me you lost it.
No, we got it all right.
The trouble is, I will not be handling it.
Well, did you talk to Larry?
Larry's the one who told me about it.
Well, I know how you feel.
But maybe Well, maybe you're just in too much of a hurry to get to the top.
Remember, you're still young.
I'm young all right, but I won't always be young.
If that's Larry, tell him I'm on my way.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Louise.
Yeah, sure I'd like to hear some good news.
Larry told you wh Darrin's got the Waterhouse account?
Oh, I can't wait to tell him.
Oh, well, all right.
If Larry wants to tell him himself, I understand.
I won't say a word.
It won't be easy, but I promise.
Oh.
Oh, I'd love to.
Yes, I'll do some shopping, and then I'll meet you for lunch.
Okay.
Bye.
- Who was it, honey?
- Louise.
- What are you so happy about?
- She wants me to meet her for lunch.
- Oh, boy.
Some life I've given you.
- What do you mean?
A little thing like going out to lunch, and you're ecstatic.
I'm easy to please.
I'll just go change, and then I'll drive you to the office.
Honey, I'm a little late.
Only take a minute.
Darrin.
Larry, I want to speak to you about the Waterhouse account.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Well, I'm talking to you about it first.
Remember the Hoffsteddler-Douglas account?
- Yes, but - Before I took over Hoffsteddler hadn't spoken to Douglas in 30 years.
- You did a fine job there, Darrin.
- Yes, I did.
And let's not overlook the Michael Sales Company account.
Before I took charge, they couldn't give away ice water in the middle of the Mojave Desert.
- A memorable job.
Yes, it was.
And don't change the subject.
Then there was the Pender Drug account, and Sheridan Cement.
All first class.
And all the others.
I haven't thought about hours or days off.
I've proved my loyalty and it's about time you gave me an unqualified vote of confidence.
Now, Larry, either I get that Waterhouse account or you get yourself a new boy.
- You got it.
I mean it, Larry.
I've got the Waterhouse account?
That's what I wanted to tell you when you came in.
Yesterday you said I couldn't have the account because I was too immature.
What did I do, age overnight?
I just thought it over, and this morning I changed my mind.
And Darrin, I know you'll do a great job.
- Good luck.
- Thanks, Larry.
You won't be sorry.
I still don't get it.
What made you change your mind?
- Oh, it's the boss' prerogative.
- I'll buy that.
Boy, I can't wait to tell Sam.
I was tempted to tell her myself but I knew that you wanted that pleasure.
Oh, yeah.
When When did you see Samantha?
Oh, just now.
Down in the parking lot.
There's a great little wife you've got there.
Has your every interest at heart.
She sure has.
She's got more confidence in me than I have in my Larry, you stopped and spoke to her?
We chatted a while.
You chatted a while.
Yes.
Larry, I resign from the Waterhouse account.
You You resign?
What are you talking about?
I will not accept any job that my wife got for me.
You got this job because you're the best man for it.
That's not the point.
Any success I make l'm going to make on my own or not at all.
Samantha.
Now, you listen to me.
I have had it with your magic and spells.
Now be quiet.
I'm not finished yet.
I've had it up to here with all your witchcraft turning me into a werewolf, into a chimpanzee!
I'm not through yet, Sam.
Just to prove that I have had it, I am going to blow this account.
Do you hear me?
I'm gonna blow the account!
What do you think of that?
Is this 555-7328?
Look, I'll have to make this fast.
Mr. Waterhouse is outside.
Before you meet him, I want to brief you - I don't need any briefing.
- Darrin, Waterhouse is a very conservative man.
He's been making thumbtacks since 1888 and he doesn't go for this modern hoopla.
I don't know why he decided to change agencies and come with us but take a tip from me and play it sincere and conservative.
Betty, would you please ask Mr. Waterhouse to come in here?
Larry, you just leave everything to me.
Well, if it isn't old J. P. Waterhouse, thumbtack king of America.
Stephens is my name and advertising is my game.
Lay it on me, baby!
Stephens?
Is that the name of the man who's handling my account?
Yes, Mr. Waterhouse.
- This is Darrin Ste - You bet your bottom dollar l'm your boy.
But time's a-wasting.
Let's get down to brass tacks.
Brass tacks!
I got a million of them.
All levity aside, Porterhouse.
Now, I've been looking at your advertising, and believe me some of your ideas went out with hoop skirts.
I mean, it's " Hey, you, kid with a wow-wow brush"!
What Darrin means, Mr. Waterhouse, is that some of your ideas could be brought into better focus Oh, no, no, Larry.
Larry, that isn't what I mean at all.
What I mean is, Waterhose, baby, you gotta get with it.
That TV commercial of yours where the executive comes in and he puts the poster up on the wall.
Oh, that has got to go.
But say what if you should take a cute little secretary and she comes into the boss' office and she's putting thumbtacks in the boss' drawer and one of those thumbtacks, it drops on the boss' chair.
The boss comes in, and he sits down.
That'll bring the TV viewer right out of his chair.
- Bring the boss out of his chair too.
- That's enough, Darrin!
Hold it, Tate.
I'll talk to this boy.
Young man, you might as well know it now.
I don't like you.
I don't like your manner, I don't like your style, I don't like your attitude.
But I do like your ideas.
Stephens, I'm putting next year's entire campaign in your hands.
- You are?
- Yes.
We've been advertising the same way for 30 years.
It's not working anymore.
That's why I changed agencies decided we have to keep things up-to-date.
Get to work on that campaign right away.
And remember one thing, gentlemen Waterhouse is my name and thumbtacks is my game.
He wants me.
Darrin, you must have somebody watching over you.
Larry, I just learned something.
- When a man can't lose, he can't win.
- Where are you going?
- To a bar, to drown my sorrows.
- Drown your sorrows?
You just landed a big account.
Well, let's just say I'm a sore winner.
Yeah, you came to the right guy for advice, Darrin.
I'm an expert.
I know everything about marriage.
That's why I'm still single.
I don't get it.
I'm married to a girl who can have anything in the whole world yet she chose me.
- Take my brother.
He's had four years of happy marriage.
The trouble is, he's been married for 16.
She must love me.
Gave up everything for me.
But obviously she misses all those luxuries.
Who can blame her?
It all boils down to the old question.
Is there a life after marriage?
She just didn't wanna hurt my pride.
Wants me to think that I'm the breadwinner.
Pretty soon the romance goes.
And, as the song says women get weary wearing the same shabby dress.
Well, then, that's the time to go out and buy her another shabby dress.
That's why she's doing it this way.
Instead of just wapping up a million dollars.
I guess I have been selfish forcing her to give up her witchhood, live on my salary.
- Poor little witch.
- You see, the thing to do is to try to keep the magic in your marriage.
I guess I'll just have to go along with her.
She's been a great wife.
Be my way of saying thanks.
Oh, listen, you're welcome.
Anytime, Darrin, old boy.
Anytime.
Oh, Darrin!
Oh, it's It's beautiful.
Well, you shouldn't have.
Oh, but I'm glad you did.
Well, I can afford it.
Because you got the Waterhouse account?
You guessed I would, huh?
Well, you deserve it.
It's beautiful.
You like my gift, huh?
Well, Darrin, you know what they say.
It isn't the gift, it's the thought that counts.
Oh, yes, of course I like it.
Sam, you could've wapped up a mink coat anytime you wanted.
Oh, darling, the important thing is that you gave it to me.
I guess I shouldn't have worried about getting that account.
After all, you said you had a strong feeling about it.
I have a strong feeling about you too.
Sam, what if I hadn't gotten the account?
Oh, Darrin, I'd feel the same way if you were a total failure.
But you're not.
You're a success.
And you're gonna be an even bigger success.
- That's love.
- That's confidence.
How about a drink?
Honey, did you ever hear that old saying: "Behind every successful man there's a woman"?
- It does seem to ring a bell.
- Well, they ain't seen nothing yet.
Suddenly I have a tremendous feeling of power.
Why?
Because nobody ever had a woman like you behind them.
Thank you.
Wow!
Sweetheart, you better take your umbrella.
I'm sure it'll stop raining in a few minutes.
It's raining hard.
What makes you think so?
Because I want it to.
- What?
- I mean, I feel it will.
- Have a good day.
- I know I will.
My, you are Mr. Confidence this morning.
I'm on a winning streak.
Darrin, it stopped.
Maybe you are on a winning streak.
Honey, there's an old gambler's expression.
When you're on a winning streak, ride it.
I'll see you tonight.
"I hope the above suggestions meet with your approval and I anxiously await your reply.
Yours very truly, et cetera, et cetera".
Larry, it's a great day.
I bet if we left now, we could be on the golf course by noon.
Golf?
You out of your mind?
You better start thinking about that Waterhouse account.
- Don't need to.
I'm on a lucky streak.
Everything I do turns out all right.
Yeah?
Well, I've yet to see luck replace hard work.
This is a very special lucky streak.
Oh, come off it, Darrin.
There's no such thing.
You want me to prove it?
Let's see.
Betty, would you mind telling me where you were born?
Why, Minneapolis.
- I bet you weren't.
- I beg your pardon?
I said I bet you weren't born in Minneapolis.
Mr. Stephens, it's right on my birth certificate.
Why don't you call up your mother now and find out.
Darrin, you're being ridiculous.
Would you like to bet me $10?
- Make it $25.
- Good.
- Betty, call your mother.
- I know I was born in Come on, Betty.
Sit down.
Use my phone.
There is no such thing as a lucky streak.
Go on, Betty.
Hello, Mom.
How are you?
Fine.
Mother, I have to ask you something that you might find a little strange.
I was born in Minneapolis, wasn't I?
What?
Where?
Why?
Are you sure?
Mom, I know you were there too.
No, l I'm not distrusting your word, Mother, I Bye.
- Well?
- I was born in Saint Paul.
Well, what about your birth certificate?
It's wrong.
I was born while Mother was visiting in Saint Paul but the family doctor was from Minneapolis and that's where he registered my birth.
Twenty-five dollars, Larry.
Mr. Tate, if it's all right with you, I think I need my lunch break now.
You go right ahead, Betty.
Betty, better take your umbrella.
It's going to rain.
Rain.
Come off it, Darrin.
There isn't a cloud in the sky.
Mr. Tate, if it's all the same to you, I'll take the umbrella.
Good girl.
Now, if you can get your mind off your lucky streak I wanna tell you the first layout for Waterhouse has to be ready by the 15th.
And if I were you l'd get started on it right away, and not trust to luck.
I'll tell you, Sam.
I'm worried about him.
I thought I better tell you before he got home.
Tell me what?
He's suddenly convinced himself that he's infallible.
He's been going around making the craziest bets.
He thinks he has some sort of strange power.
Well, that doesn't sound like Darrin.
Larry, are you sure you're not exaggerating?
He just wanted to bet me he could make the sun come out at midnight.
You're not exaggerating.
When did all this start?
I noticed him behaving strangely when I told him he had the Waterhouse account.
He shouted something about not having his life run by his wife.
You don't think he's on the verge of a nerv ous breakdown?
No.
No, no, Larry.
I don't think that's what he's on the verge of.
Then why is he acting as if he had a charmed life?
Well, I wouldn't worry about it if I were you.
I'm sure by tomorrow he'll be back to normal.
Bye.
He didn't even ask me if I'd used witchcraft.
He tried me, judged me and sentenced me without even giving me a chance to defend myself.
It reminds me of the old days in Salem.
As a matter of fact, he even looks like the judge who sentenced your poor Aunt Agnes to the stake.
- Oh, Mother.
How could he doubt me?
How could he think he'd gotten that job through witchcraft?
Please give him credit for having the sense to realize that he didn't get it because of his brains.
There's only one thing to do.
- Teach him a lesson.
- Excellent.
Now, that is excellent.
Why not turn him into a dinosaur?
Or a salamander?
Or perhaps you No.
No, mother.
I'm gonna do it my way.
Well, all right, dear.
But don't overlook the dinosaur.
The neighbours might get quite a kick out of it.
I have a better idea.
- Honey, I'm ho - Good evening, sir.
Madam will be down presently.
Samantha!
Saman - Hi, darling.
- What have you done?
- You noticed, huh?
- Noticed?
How can you miss the Taj Mahal?
Well, Darrin, I'll be honest with you.
I found out that you found out about my little plan.
Well, you know.
My giving you a charmed life.
- You did, huh?
- Yes.
And it was sweet of you to go along with it.
Anyway, since you decided to go along with it I thought we might as well be completely honest with each other.
L - Two very dry martinis, Charles.
- Right away, madam.
You'll simply adore Charles.
He's in charge of the rest of the staff.
What staff?
The upstairs maid, the chef and your valet.
Now, where was I?
We were just being completely honest with each other.
Yes, of course.
Since you found out about my scheme and you didn't seem to have any objections, I thought it was silly to be devious any longer.
That makes sense, doesn't it?
I suppose so.
Good.
Now, in the future if we need anything, I'll just zap it up.
Oh, Darrin, it'll be so marvellous.
I'll be able to give you anything you want.
Thank you, Charles.
Your dinner clothes are all laid out for you, sir.
Sir?
All right, sweetheart, here's to your success.
- What's the matter?
- I can't swallow this.
But Charles makes the best martinis in the whole world.
No, I mean this.
It's no good, Sam.
I can't live this way.
Look, I sympathize with you wanting all these things but, well, you're gonna have to make a choice.
It's either me or this.
Don't you think you're being unreasonable?
I will not be helped by witchcraft.
You didn't seem to mind when it got you the Waterhouse account.
- That was different.
I did that for you.
- The Pender Drug account six months ago?
- You got me that too?
And the Cushman Furniture account.
And the carpet account.
Hold it!
There's only one thing that got me that account, and that was me.
I showed them how to increase their business by 39.2 percent in the first fiscal year.
And the Sheridan Cement account.
Sheridan Cement?
There was no witchcraft there.
I knew more about Sheridan Cement than Sheridan did.
It's about time you found out there are some things in this world like talent, ability and hard work that will not be replaced by witchcraft.
You forgot one thing.
What?
- Faith.
- Faith?
Faith in the person closest to you.
Faith enough to know that when a promise is made, it's going to be kept.
You didn't get me the Waterhouse account?
You didn't stop the rain?
And you didn't change Betty's birthplace?
I'm not sure, but I don't even think that's legal.
I thought Darrin, all you had to do was ask me.
One more question.
Could you possibly spend the rest of your life with a big dumb-head who promises never to jump to conclusions again?
You just talked me into it.
You know, it's amazing how many things I guessed right yesterday.
You don't suppose I do have some special power, do you?
Oh, now, Darrin, don't let a few lucky coincidences go to your head.
You better take your umbrella.
No, I won't need my umbrella or my coat.
- But it's pouring.
- It'll stop in a few seconds.
I'm running a little test.
Bye, honey.
- Convinced?
- Convinced.
{END OF EPISODE 37}{START OF EPISODE 38}
Oh, Tabatha your daddy's gonna be awfully proud of you this evening.
Imagine.
Pointing at your age.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
Hello, Tabatha.
Did you have a nice day today?
Well, we had a very important day today.
Darling, you have a most unusual daughter.
Well, what makes you say that?
Well, not many little girls can do what she did at her age.
Well, what did she do that was so unusual?
She pointed at that lamp.
Well, what did it do?
- What?
- The lamp.
Well, lamps don't do anything.
But she pointed at it.
Oh, Darrin, this has nothing to do with witchcraft.
She simply pointed at the lamp.
I thought you'd be pleased.
I am pleased.
And very relieved.
Well, all right.
I'll go and fix dinner and you hang on to her for a while, huh?
Okay.
Sweetheart, I apologize for accusing you of having any hocus-pocus with that there lamp.
Sam.
Sam!
What's the matter?
Honey, it must've been a delayed reaction.
The lamp It went - The lamp It went on by itself.
- Oh, Darrin.
Well, then how do you explain how it went on?
Well, I can't exactly explain it technically.
It's a big mystery to me too.
- It is?
- Yes.
But, as I walked out of the room I flicked this switch right here and the light went on.
Oh, is that all?
Is that all?
Well, I think that's remarkable.
Look.
Off.
On.
Now, that's what I call magic.
Well, have you recovered from the marvels of electricity yet?
Thank you.
And don't rub it in.
Anything else happen today?
No Oh, I forgot to tell you.
Gladys Kravitz telephoned.
She wants us to come over and watch television.
- How come?
- Well, it's kind of a special occasion.
You remember Gladys' brother, Louis?
How could I ever forget Louis Gruber, the chicken fiddler?
Well, he isn't chicken anymore.
He's played a number of concerts.
Tonight he's making his debut on national television.
He owes it all to you, Sam.
- All he needed was a little confidence.
- Well, you sure gave it to him.
Yeah, much against your wishes as I recall.
You were pregnant at the time.
And you didn't want me overexerting my nose?
No.
Let's just hope this evening is not as disastrous as the last time we visited the Kravitz's.
That was a bit of a fiasco, wasn't it?
It all started with the banana cake, as I remember.
Honey, do I really have to wear a tie?
Yes, you have to wear a tie.
And hurry up.
We'll be late.
I could be about three days late for this thing.
We'll probably sit around all night listening to him play the violin.
I hope he does play.
He's supposed to be very talented.
Mrs. Kravitz said so.
What do you expect Mrs. Kravitz to say about her brother?
You should hear what Mr. Kravitz said.
Oh, that reminds me.
I promised to take a banana cake over for dessert.
Why?
Well, evidently Louis is a big eater.
Besides, I know you like my banana cake better than Mrs. Kravtiz's.
Well, at least you peel the bananas.
It looks marvellous.
What recipe did you use?
Oh, it was one of those instant mixes.
Hello, neighbours.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Louis will be down in a minute.
I can't wait.
Oh, please, please, sit down.
Sit down.
Louis said that if he's in the mood, he'll play for us tonight.
Oh, that's marvellous.
And if she's in the mood, she'll dance.
Go ahead, get your tambourine.
Abner, Louis is only here once a year.
Like locusts.
It's only a stopover.
He's going on tour very soon.
On tour of relatives.
He goes from one to the other with an open hand and open mouth.
He happens to be a brilliant violinist.
"A Genius of the First Magnitude".
Buffalo Daily Record.
Ask her if he works.
Go ahead, ask her.
He's just between engagements.
Twenty-six years between engagements.
He should go out and get a job.
He can't get an ordinary job he'd hurt his hands.
Then let him take a job with his feet.
Maybe we should come back some other time.
Why?
It won't get any better.
Oh, good evening.
Oh, good, you brought the cake.
This is my brother, Louis Gruber.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
- Hello.
- How do you do?
Easy.
Thank you.
Mrs. Kravitz said you were about to go on tour.
Yes.
L I had been giving it some thought.
I think that's wonderful.
When would it be?
One doesn't measure these things by time.
He measures them by free meals.
Mrs. Kravitz was saying you were only 9 years old when you played in Carnegie Hall.
Please, don't mention Carnegie.
That was my last performance.
And what a performance.
Sounds interesting.
Full house, standing room.
I don't wanna talk about it.
I wouldn't talk about it either if my knickers fell down.
Three encores he got.
Gladys, he's doing it again.
- Abner!
- I was telling the truth.
Gladys, let's eat.
Louis wants to eat.
Let's eat.
Are you ready to eat?
Let's everybody eat.
Shall we eat?
Come on, let's eat.
Louis, ready to eat?
You wanna see a great artist?
That's where he does his best work.
During his career, Louis met very important people.
Kings, queens, dukes, dictators.
Yup.
Those were the days.
It's not easy reaching your prime when you're 9.
But what about your new tour?
Won't be the same.
There are certain things in life that happen only once and then gone forever.
Like that meat loaf.
Did you see it go?
Abner, Louis is talking.
At least he's not eating.
Louis, I'm sure you'll be a success again.
I don't think people have forgotten you.
How could they?
His knickers fell down.
Sam's right.
A man with your talent shouldn't have any trouble.
Talent?
What's the meaning of talent?
Who's got talent now?
Who?
Well, Heifetz.
He plays with his thumbs.
Heifetz?
He's brilliant.
He should play the square dance.
Well, what about Isaac Stern?
Plays a pizzicato like I pick my teeth.
Well, then, why are these men on top?
Politics.
It's who you know.
It's knowing people.
You know how Stern got where he is today?
He knew Heifetz.
They must've had some talent.
Talent, yes.
Genius, no.
That's why they're afraid of me.
I've got genius.
"A Rising Genius on the Concert Horizon".
St. Louis Herald.
They're all against me.
It's common knowledge.
Well, Louis if you're as good as you say you are, then You don't think I can play, do you?
Well, I didn't say that Say it.
I'm a fraud.
- You're a fraud.
- Darrin, please.
It doesn't really matter.
I know I'm a genius.
"A Born Virtuoso".
Arturo Toscanini.
"Born Eater".

I am a proven artist.
Three world tours, two gold records One snapshot.
Your little knickers on the floor.
Laugh, clown, laugh.
But I'll have the last laugh.
Abner!
How could you do that?
- You know he's so sensitive.
- Sensitive?
He's scared stiff.
Since the knickers, he can't play in front of an audience.
That's not true.
It's Heifetz and Stern and the rest of the crowd.
They won't give him a chance.
I still think if he has that much talent, he should Now, watch this.
Bravo!
I don't believe it.
He was extraordinary.
Wasn't he?
No, not that.
He's gonna miss dessert.
And you thought it was gonna be a dull evening.
Well, I don't know who gave the better performance, Louis or Mr. Kravitz.
It's too bad he hasn't had a chance to play.
Well, you heard what Abner said.
He's scared.
- And I'm inclined to agree with him.
- All he needs is a little push.
Well, if he stays with Abner, he'll get it right out the window.
Louis could play at the hospital benefit, Saturday.
- Sam, don't - There'll be a big crowd lots of important people.
Might be good for his confidence.
Sam, you're a housewife, not Sol Hurok.
I could call the entertainment committee.
It wouldn't be any trouble.
Sam, stay out if it, please.
Louis needs a chance.
The hospital needs money.
It's a perfect plan.
So was Custer's.
- You're still at it?
- You know I have to practice.
Since 5:00 this morning?
When am I gonna get some peace and quiet?
Abner, let him alone.
He's practicing.
Go for a walk.
I've been for a walk seven times around the block already.
The neighbours think I'm I'm a peddler.
- I cannot practice in this atmosphere.
- Good.
Abner, if he stops practicing, he'll lose his touch.
If he doesn't stop, he'll lose his teeth.
So you want to hit someone, huh?
- Well, then hit.
Hit, hit, hit, hit.
- The feet, the feet, watch the feet.
Gladys, think of what you're doing.
You've been protecting him all your life.
You've treated him like a baby.
That's why he can't get a job.
A big baby!
I've tried to get jobs, dozens of them, but they won't have me.
What about Philadelphia?
- That wasn't my fault.
I was sick.
- Sick?
You were afraid.
He was sick.
You know he had fever, he was white.
He was yellow.
He chickened out.
He's the chicken fiddler.
I don't have to take this.
- I'm leaving.
- Good.
Only the room.
Louis, please.
Stay here and practice.
- For how long?
- Another hour.
Abner, he's got to perfect his technique.
Keep his fingers in shape.
Why, we're having hot biscuits again?
You'll be proud of me one day.
When I'm back at Carnegie Hall and I have the whole world at my feet.
That's better than your knickers.
Come in.
Hi, I've got great news.
I've arranged everything.
- Louis, you're gonna give a concert.
- A concert?
Yes, Saturday matinee, the Hospital Benefit.
- Is there an audience?
- Oh, yes.
It'll be a sell-out.
At least 500 people.
Five hundred people.
I know you're trying to help, Mrs. Stephens but you've gotta get Louis out of this.
L I can't.
The programs are printed and the tickets are sold.
Tell him that.
I did.
He fainted again.
Now, Mrs. Kravitz, I know this will be the best thing for him.
He's been ready for 26 years.
He's a big boy now.
He's going to have to face himself some time.
What am I gonna do?
You won't have to do a thing.
Just leave him to me.
I'll get him to play.
My baby brother, growing up so fast.
Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Soon he'll be going out with girls.
Oh, how soon we lose them.
What's wrong with her?
Oh, she's just worried about Louis and the concert.
Sam, what are you getting involved in this for?
Well, I am kind of responsible.
I got him into it.
Besides, he's a great violinist.
And he should be heard.
Poor Gladys.
Poor Gladys?
Poor Abner.
Putting up with all that practicing.
Well, don't worry.
Abner won't be bothered by that anymore.
Why?
Because Louis is gonna do his practicing here.
Louis Gruber does not play benefits.
Why not?
Everybody else does.
It's all wrong.
I don't know why I came here in the first place.
Because I made beef stroganoff.
- Good.
Let's eat.
- Practice first.
You're going to have to play for your supper tonight.
Tonight, yes.
Tomorrow, no.
Now, Louis, what happened with your knickers at Carnegie Hall, well, it's all over and done with.
Now, no more excuses.
The concert's tomorrow afternoon.
I can't.
I can't.
Oh, but, now, Louis.
Louis, you were doing beautifully.
No, no, it's true what they say about me.
I am afraid.
I am a coward.
I am a chicken fiddler!
Practice.
- What's for dinner?
- Never mind.
Start playing.
Start playing.
What must be done, must be done!
Blast!
What is this?
What kind of varnish are you wearing?
Good, good.
I'm glad to see you're still practicing.
What got into you?
You see that?
Soup!
Gladys made it herself.
Chicken noodle for the chicken fiddler.
Now, Mr. Kravitz, Louis is doing just fine.
Look at him.
I should have brought a funnel.
You go and tell Mrs. Kravitz everything's gonna be okay.
Why?
Has the benefit been cancelled?
No.
You be ready at 1:30.
We'll pick you up.
All right.
Well, for the benefit of the benefit, I hope he Oh, no!
He did it.
He did it!
He did it.
Louis, please, believe me, I'm sorry.
Mrs. Stephens, it was an accident.
It's perfectly all right.
Don't worry about it.
I won't have to play that benefit tomorrow.
And I really wanted to.
- What can we do?
- Cancel the benefit.
No, no.
I have another violin in the house.
Well, I just can't play any old violin.
Good.
I think it's a pretty good one.
It's not as good as a handmade Dimkis.
Stradivarius!
Gladys said she was bringing him right over.
I shouldn't have let him out of my sight.
- He's only got 15 minutes.
- Oh, he'll be here.
He knows they're gonna have cake after the show.
Maybe I should call and find out It wasn't my fault!
I couldn't do anything!
- What happened?
- I couldn't stop him!
Gladys, what happened?
Louis is gone.
What?
He said he was going for a paper.
A paper?
Where?
Philadelphia!
Chicken fiddler strikes again.
He took a cab to the airport.
Cab?
Who paid?
Oh, I knew this would happen.
We'll get him back.
Honey, he's only got six minutes.
I guess we better call the whole thing off.
I think we should wait a couple of minutes.
I have a feeling he'll be here.
Hey, what's going on here?
I don't know.
Ask the cab.
I gotta get out of here.
Louis.
I'll get him.
Louis, come back.
That only works in the movies.
He went down in the manhole.
We've got to do something.
I know what I'd like to do.
Put the cover on it.
We'll never get him now.
Oh, yes, we will.
- Ready, Louis?
- I was just going for a paper.
In the sewer?
My baby!
My poor baby!
That poor baby cost me 7 and a half bucks for a cab.
- Come on, Louis.
- No.
- Come on.
- No.
- Here you go, Louis.
- No, no.
- And this one.
- No, no.
No.
No.
My poor baby.
What's he doing?
I think he's praying.
No.
I think he's crying.
Louis, Louis!
Sam, is that you or him playing?
Oh, I just got him started.
Attaboy, Louis!
Play like you eat.
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
Louis on a big TV show.
That's nothing.
He has so many concerts after this.
Well, Sam, he owes it all to you.
That's right, Mrs. Stephens.
That benefit gave him the confidence.
No, no.
He has the talent.
I just got him started.
And now, ladies and gentlemen.
The world famous violinist, Louis Gruber.
Oh, doesn't he look handsome?
Except for the chicken soup on his lapel.
Oh, my stars!
The knickers routine again.
This time, coast-to-coast.
Well, Sam, when's the next benefit?
