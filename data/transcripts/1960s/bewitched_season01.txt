{START OF EPISODE 01}
Once upon a time, there was a typical American girl who happened to bump into a typical red-blooded American boy.
And she bumped into him, and bumped into him.
They decided they better sit down and talk this over before they had an accident.
They became good friends.
They found they had a lot of interests in common.
Radio.
Television.
Trains.
And when the boy found the girl attractive, desirable, irresistible he did what any red-blooded American boy would do.
; He ask ed her to marry him.
They had a typical wedding went on a typical honeymoon, in a typical bridal suite.
Except it so happens that this girl is a witch.
Every young girl needs love and romance.
There is one thing she doesn't need.
Mother, what are you doing here?
What am I doing here?
What are you doing here?
- I'm married.
- I know.
Let you out of my sight for one moment Hold on, we'll be home before you can say I don't want to go.
I was afraid of that.
He has you under a spell, eh?
- These male witches are the worst kind.
- He's not a witch.
What?
He happens to be, excuse the expression a normal, mortal human being.
Well, that's easy.
I'll just have him trip over a rug and break an arm.
Mother, you'll leave him alone.
He's a dear, sweet, wonderful, perfectly marvellous man.
Oh, my poor baby.
He sounds simply horrible.
Out of the way, Samantha, I'll get you out of here.
- I'm not going.
- Really.
How would you like to spend your wedding night with a bullfrog?
Don't you understand?
I'm happy with him.
Don't talk to your mother like that.
I'll tell you when you're happy.
- He's coming in.
- I'll take care of that.
Easy now.
I'm not going to hurt him.
Must be the champagne.
May I have my key please?
Mother, you've got to get out of here.
Even witchcraft can't keep him out there all night.
It's our honeymoon.
I don't know where you get it, must be from your father.
Certainly not from my side of the family.
Mother, he's coming in, and you're going out.
- Oh, no, I'm not.
- Oh, yes, you are.
One Re, Or Re, Ick ery Ann Phillison, Follison, Nicholas John You are kidding.
I've never been more serious in my life.
One Re, Or Re, Ick ery Ann Phillison, Follison, Nicholas John Queevy quavy English navy Stickum, stackum Buck B-U-C-K spells "buck" And out goes you - Well, you naughty, naughty little witch.
- Please.
No.
You're still very young and inexperienced.
You don't know what prejudice you'll run into.
They all think that witches work only one day a year, on Halloween.
We all wear those big ugly hats and fly around on brooms.
What if he finds out you're a witch?
- I'm going to tell him.
- You're going to tell him?
Married people shouldn't have secrets from one another.
- When are you going to tell him?
- As soon as you leave.
That should solve everything.
You'll be home before you know it.
Mother.
Good.
The strangest things have been happening.
I took one glass of champagne and suddenly I found myself Sweetheart, let's sit down and talk.
What?
- You're a what?
- I'm a witch.
That's wonderful.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
Now.
I am a witch.
A real house-haunting, broom-riding, cauldron-stirring witch.
It must be the champagne.
It's been a hectic day.
Getting married is not as easy as it looks.
Would I say I was a witch if I'm not?
I don't know.
I have an aunt who thinks she's a lighthouse and whenever it rains she climbs on the garage roof to warn the sailors.
How do you know she isn't a lighthouse?
Maybe you're looking at a lighthouse and think you're seeing an old lady on a garage roof.
- Okay, okay, okay.
My aunt is a lighthouse and you're a witch.
You don't believe me.
Where's your black hat and broom, and how come you're out when it isn't even Halloween?
- Mother was right, you're prejudiced.
You told me your mother was in India.
She is but she dropped in on me this evening.
- Here?
- Yes.
- Is she here now?
- No.
Good because I don't care for an invisible mother-in-law along on my honeymoon.
I guess I'll just have to prove to you that I'm a witch.
That's a good idea.
Prove it.
I wasn't gonna do any more witchcraft for your sake.
I'm from Missouri.
You know what that means?
- What?
- Show me.
- I'm not very experienced at it.
- Well, you're young yet.
- I can only do little things.
- A little thing will be just fine.
Any old little thing.
I have yet to see a table lighter that works.
Just once, I would like to see Sweetheart, we all imagine things.
Now I myself You may not believe this, but Sweetheart I need some air.
I wish I had a drink.
An old-fashioned.
And a straw.
You're a witch.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Darling, are you all right?
No.
No, I'm not all right.
Darrin, I suppose I shouldn't have married you, but I love you so much.
I love you too, but I hadn't figured on this.
I'll make you a good wife, I promise.
This is not something like somebody who just thinks they're a lighthouse.
Oh, Darrin I love you so much.
We've got to figure this out later.
And if you can't talk to your best friend, who can you talk to?
I know all about marriage.
That's why I'm a bachelor.
- That's my problem.
- A sea of matrimony is beset with hidden shoals and reefs.
- Just found out Samantha's a witch.
It takes tolerance and understanding to find the channel of true love.
I didn't believe till she moved things around.
Marriage is a partnership, where two people, side by side face life's obstacles together.
- I can't tell my family.
If two people love each other, really love each other, it'll work out.
I have trouble getting my aunt off the garage roof when it rains.
Adjustment, the foundation on which every lasting marriage is built.
Adjust.
It might have some advantages, like if you wanted a drink in a dry state.
I gotta go.
If you need any help or advice again, feel free to call on me.
Doc, we've been friends for a long time.
I don't know if you can help me, but I had to bring this problem to you.
Darrin, that's what I'm here for.
Just tell me what's bothering you.
I'm married to a witch.
A real live house-haunting, broom-riding cauldron-stirring, card-carrying witch.
You came to me for advice.
I'll give you some.
Now that you've had your honeymoon, why don't you take a vacation?
Al my wife is a witch.
Cheer up.
You should see my wife.
And I've gone over it and over it in my mind.
And I've come to a decision.
I love you, and I can't give you up.
Darling, I'll be the best wife a man ever had.
I know you will.
We're going to have a nice, normal, happy life together and no more: No, no.
I promise.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's tough enough being married to an advertising man if you're normal.
You're going to have to learn to be a suburban housewife.
- I'll learn, you'll see.
I'll learn.
- Now you'll have to learn to cook keep house and go to my mother's house for dinner every Friday night.
Darling, it sounds wonderful.
And soon we'll be a normal, happy couple with no problems just like everybody else.
And then my mother can come and visit for a while and Oh, well, maybe we better work up to that gradually.
Oh, I'll try.
I promise I'll try.
I'm glad that's settled.
- Let's drink to it.
- An old-fashioned?
- With a cherry on top.
- I'll make it myself.
All by yourself.
We'll work it out somehow.
So my wife's a witch.
Every married man has to make some adjustment.
Miss Summers, I'm afraid Mr. Stephens is tied up Don't give it a thought, Helen.
He'll be glad to see me.
I'll dash in.
Darrin.
Sheila.
Darling, I just got back from Nassau yesterday and I've been trying to reach you.
I left a message.
And when I didn't hear from you, I decided to invade your office.
- Why didn't you call me?
- Well, Sheila You see I just got back I was - I'm married.
- Oh, I know, dear.
Congratulations.
Now, I know you've got every reason - You don't care?
- Oh, sweetheart.
Care?
Of course I care.
After all, if I hadn't left for Nassau when I did it might've been me.
But no hard feelings, you see.
Darrin, I couldn't be happier for you.
And I'm sure she's an angel.
I just stopped by to ask the two of you to drop over tonight if you have no other plans.
A few of the gang are coming over for potluck.
Well, I realize it's rather short notice.
Nothing fancy.
Very relaxed.
Sitting-on-the-floor kind of thing.
Well, that's very nice of you, Sheila.
But I don't know.
It may be too soon to spring a new set of people on her.
- She's not used to - Too soon?
Don't be silly, Darrin.
We're your friends.
We're dying to meet her.
Unless, of course, you feel uncomfortable.
Me?
Well, of course not.
Fine.
Then it's all set, 7:30 tonight.
I've gotta dash.
See you later.
Boy, some fancy-Iooking place.
Darrin, you sure I'm dressed all right?
Darling, of course you are.
Sheila said it was potluck very relaxed, sitting-on-the-floor kind of stuff.
- Darrin, darling.
- Sheila.
Is this your little bride?
- How do you do?
- Why, Darrin, she's sweet.
- Maybe I should've dressed - Not at all, dear, you look sweet.
- John, would do take Mrs Stephens'?
- Sweater.
I can tell you're the type who always dresses so sensibly.
You know, the capable type.
Darrin, I bet she's good at typing cooking, taking care of the household accounts and playing golf.
All those things poor little me can't do at all.
Pity.
Won't you come in and meet my friends?
Folks, I'd like you to meet Darrin's little bride.
You must bring Samantha down to the club.
- Are you all right, dear?
- Oh, yes.
Yes, fine, thank you.
Now, don't worry about Samantha, Darrin.
We're all going to help her.
Everybody, I said that since Samantha is a stranger here that we're all going to help her and make her feel at home.
Now, first, dear, we've got to get you a good dressmaker.
- But I don't need - We'll introduce you to Pierre.
He does wonders with hard-to-manage hair.
Haven't we met somewhere before?
- No, no, I don't think - Newport.
- No.
- The Riviera.
- No.
- Speaking of travelling remember, Darrin, that time we met in Paris and you said when I sent you a telegram?
Darrin, only last night at dinner, Harry was telling me that you were the brightest young prospect in the agency business.
Real Madison Avenue know-how.
Sheila always looks so beautiful, never a hair out of place.
A wonderful girl.
Nothing she can't do.
You know, she owns her own plane.
- Do you fly?
- Oh, yes.
Do you know Dr. Hafter, dear?
Samantha?
- Beg your pardon?
- Dr. Hafter.
Do you know him?
- No.
- The plastic surgeon.
Does beautiful nose work.
No, I don't know him.
Funny, I could have sworn you I won't do it.
Darrin, do you remember that delightful time we had with the contessa at Maxim's?
- I won't.
Anyway, last I heard they were involved in the most delicious scandal.
Maybe I will.
Oh, and the tennis matches start in Easthampton this Saturday I thought we could get the same group we had last year My house is open.
And, you know, we could have - weekend of it.
Wouldn't that be divine?
We'd so like to have you and Samantha over for dinner next week.
If Tuesday's good, Harry's invited Mr. Donahue.
Samantha and I would be glad to come to dinner.
- Thank you, Mrs. Rutherford - Remember how cozy it was sitting by the fire, Darrin?
How the others slipped away and went out without our noticing?
It was beyond me.
Wait till you see the sports car I sent over from Europe.
It's simply gorgeous.
Reminds me of the one we looked at in California.
Gregor is in town.
Don't plan to be home for dinner Wednesday night.
He's having close friends to show his new paintings and you must come.
Show me what to buy.
I'll pick you up at the office at At 6.
My zipper.
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.
I thought I was carrying an empty tray.
Excuse me.
Her bracelet.
Sheila!
Here, here.
Let me help you.
The soup really is delicious.
As soon as Sheila gets down, I must get the recipe.
It's good.
It really is.
Sam, I'm not saying you were entirely wrong.
Sheila had it coming, but you went a little far.
It was hard to tell which witch was which.
- Sam.
- Just a little play on words.
I'm only trying to say that you broke your promise.
- You gave me your word, no more - Stuff.
It's harder to break the habit than I thought.
Well, you can do it.
I've got a lot of faith in you.
Thank you, darling.
Well, it's bedtime.
I've just got to get this kitchen cleaned up.
- Tomorrow.
- That's what you said last night.
Yeah.
Well Don't take too long.
Oh, well.
Maybe I can taper off.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Here you see the average, normal suburban housewife in one of her daily routine tasks.
; preparing breakfast for her husband.
With a modern kitchen and all conveniences at her disposal the capable housewife moves efficiently through her tasks.
Of course, sometimes there are problems especially if your husband expects breakfast ready before he goes to work.
But that's no problem for the average, normal suburban housewife if she happens to be a witch.
Hi, honey.
Doesn't that look good!
What a ridiculous waste of time and energy.
I prefer to think of it as doing something that will please my husband.
Well, you needn't develop biceps doing it.
If you want to decorate a cake you merely put a small ring of rosebuds there with vines and leaves.
A gazebo in the centre surrounded by Grecian columns there, there, there.
So there.
Oh, that's lovely.
Just because you married a human, Samantha that's no reason to overdo this grubby little housewife role.
Well, you call it whatever you like.
I promised Darrin no witchcraft, and no witchcraft is what he's gonna get.
Very well.
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.
As a mother I've apparently failed you completely.
You've done a wonderful job.
I got myself a great husband, didn't I?
When I think what you could have had, I get positively ill.
Darrin is a marvellous human being.
That's a terrible thing to say about anyone.
How can you be so prejudiced?
You haven't even met him.
- You hardly know what he looks like.
- Oh, they all look alike to me.
Noses to the grindstone, shoulders to the wheel feet planted firmly on the ground.
No wonder they can't fly.
Darrin's not like that.
Don't contradict your mother, Samantha, of course he is.
Look what he's done to you already.
You've changed, Samantha, you really have.
And soon I won't be able to pick you out in a crowd.
Oh, sure you will.
I'll be the one with strawberry frosting in my hair.
- How's that?
- Oh, it's revolting.
But I'm sure what's-his-name will make a pig of himself over it.
His name is Darrin, Mother.
You don't fool me one bit.
You're dying to meet him, and he wants to meet you.
Samantha!
Honey, I'm home.
- Oh, there he is.
- You better go.
Why?
I want to study him up close.
- Not now.
- Don't worry, he won't see me.
Witch's honour.
And you know me to be a witch of my word.
Good.
- Samantha.
- I'll be right there, darling.
- Hi, darling.
- Hello, honey.
- What's the matter?
- Matter?
- No kiss?
- Oh, sorry, darling.
Is that him?
- Sam, are you all right?
- Me?
Of course, why?
I've had more passionate kisses from my father.
What are you looking?
How's that?
It's an improvement.
- How about a drink?
- Great idea.
There's something I want to talk to you about, Sam.
What is it?
I drove out of the city today Cheers.
I drove out of the city What are you looking at?
- Nothing.
- Nothing.
What's the matter with you?
- Is something wrong?
- There's absolutely nothing wrong.
- You're sure?
- I love you the way you are.
I love everything about you.
That's the way I like to hear you talk.
Why don't you come on over here.
That's a wonderful perfume you're wearing.
Oh, that.
I've had it on all day.
I think I'll go put on some fresh.
- What is the matter with you?
- What do you mean, dear?
You were friendlier on our first date.
Samantha!
I was not.
Sam, are you angry about something?
Why, no, of course not.
It's just that I think some things should be kept to ourselves.
You were talking about driving out of the city.
Yes, well, I drove out to a new development Some things should be kept to ourselves?
Who's here?
What do you mean?
Just what I said.
Who's here in this room with us?
Is somebody watching us?
Darling, isn't that silly?
You don't see anyone, do you?
- What has that got to do with it?
- I mean, who could be here?
Nobody that I know, but I don't know about the people you know.
People I know, you can see, but I'm not sure about people you know.
I promise, darling, there's no one here but just the two of us.
Yeah?
Prove it.
That better?
If you're lying, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
I love your hair.
It always feels so soft, smells so good.
Tastes good too.
What is that?
Strawberry frosting.
It was gonna be a surprise.
It is a surprise.
I always thought you had plain, ordinary hair.
- Do you like it?
- I love your hair.
I mean the frosting.
I baked you a cake.
- Really?
- That's the surprise.
Well, one surprise deserves another.
- I drove out of the city today - You said that.
To see a house.
Not a rented house, with someone else's furniture, carpets and drapes but our own house.
Something we can own from top to bottom, from one end to the other.
Our house!
Now what do you think of that?
- Well, I think - Before you say anything just take a look at this.
It's laid out beautifully.
Big rooms, full of sunshine.
It looks very nice.
It's the kind of house we wouldn't have been able to afford for a long time.
Even with the buy we're getting, we're gonna have to tighten our belts.
I think so.
Shoulder to the wheel, in a manner of speaking.
"Nose to the grindstone".
- Nose to the grindstone?
- Right.
It's really just a matter of keeping our feet planted firmly on the ground.
Well, how does it sound to you?
Don't you like the idea, honey?
Of course I like the idea, it sounds wonderful.
Well, for a minute there Anything that makes you happy makes me happy.
Okay.
I'm about to make you the happiest woman in the world.
Get my dinner.
- Was that you laughing?
- Oh, yes.
That was a very cute joke you made about getting your dinner.
- I'll meet you at the house at 3:00.
- Okay.
Remember what I told you, it's up to you.
- Lf you don't like it, we'll forget it.
- I know I'll love it.
- Sure you had enough breakfast?
- Plenty.
You wouldn't prefer eggs or something like that?
No, sweetheart, the cake was just fine.
I'll see you at 3.
- Bye-bye, baby.
- Bye.
Well, I think we're very lucky.
All young married people dream of owning their own home.
Well, it's fine for them, Samantha, but not for us.
We're quicksilver, a fleeting shadow, a distant sound.
Our home has no boundaries beyond which we cannot pass.
We live in music, in a flash of colour.
We live on the wind in the sparkle of a star.
And you want to trade it all for a quarter of an acre of crabgrass.
Well, now, Mother, if Darrin's this excited, there must be something to it.
Now, I'm going to take a look at that house.
At least you can keep an open mind and go with me.
You mean you're interested in my opinion?
You said you wanted me to be happy.
Well, all right, I'll look at it with you.
But I won't like it.
It'll only take me a second to change, then we can go.
I'm ready whenever you are.
Mother!
You are kidding.
What's-his-name got cake crumbs all over the floor.
Is this it?
isn't it nice?
It's filthy.
Well, all it needs is a little landscaping.
Sows' ears are not made into silk purses by the mere addition of a few dandelions.
Don't waste your time, it's not for you.
Mother, just use your imagination.
I could do wonderful things with a place like this.
- It's impossible.
You're a witch, Samantha, not a magician.
There are two of them, Abner, both women.
One older.
Maybe a sister, maybe a mother.
Come take a look, Abner.
Leave me alone.
I'm retired.
You're just being stubborn.
Picture it with a lovely lawn around it, and some flowers, trees and a hedge.
A lawn, you said?
Look lovely and green?
A hedge.
That's an English box hedge, isn't it sweet?
Yes, and flowers?
There, aren't they colourful?
And the little window boxes.
Yes.
What else did you say?
Trees?
There.
Voilá, what do you have?
Lawn, hedge, flowers, trees, all surrounding a sow's ear.
No wonder, the way you have things thrown around.
What do you mean by that?
For instance, I don't think we need the hedge.
Two trees is one too many.
Keep the big one, but over there.
Oh, my!
Isn't that lovely?
There's something missing.
I know.
Awnings.
It's marvellous, Samantha, marvellous.
I couldn't have done better myself.
- Abner.
- I've got three more words.
Will you wait?
I'm trying to get you interested in civic affairs and you need words.
What do I care about words?
- Abner!
- What?
Abner, come here.
Gladys, I worked like a dog for 32 years.
The house across the street has got a lawn and there are trees and flowers.
Well, what do you want from me?
Well, that's the way it'll look someday.
What's the matter with you, Samantha?
At least the place looked somewhat liveable.
Oh, no.
We're going to do it the right way, from seeds.
Seed!
That lot was plain, ordinary dirt.
Now it's a jungle with plants and flowers.
- Come take a look, Abner.
- Gladys, don't pull.
- Take a spoonful of your medicine.
- I don't need my medicine.
I say you do and I never lied to you, Gladys.
Come look, Abner.
If there's no trees, you'll take a spoonful?
- I promise.
- Go get it.
Well, the living room's beautiful.
Darrin was right.
Oh, it's a little cramped, but passable.
- I'm going to go look at the kitchen.
- Well, if you must.
Abner!
Well?
It's a wonderful kitchen, full of dozens of gadgets.
It's gonna be fun cooking in there.
- Say, I like that chair.
- Thank you, have one.
Wonderfully comfortable.
Splendid job, Mother.
I've taken a fling at decorating in my time.
I thought you didn't go in for earthy things.
Nothing more than a creative challenge, really.
What table would go well with these chairs?
Something low and heavy, do you think?
I don't know.
Something along those lines, I would imagine.
Oh, that's beautiful!
And how about a sofa over there?
Something comfortable and overstuffed, like that.
Yes, it's very nice.
And of course, a coffee table.
Goes quite well.
And over the fireplace, a painting.
Something colourful and full of life.
That's very pretty.
And in the dining room A little bit too severe.
You really think so?
Well, maybe you're right.
How about that?
That's much better.
That's much better.
And draperies!
- Very nice.
- And a buffet.
Oh, Mother, isn't it lovely?
You have something there, I must say.
Let's go up and look at the bedrooms.
Why go up there?
Why don't we just send for them?
Oh, my poor feet.
That's better.
Don't try and stop me, Abner, I'm going over there.
There's something going on, and I'm going to find out what it is.
What's a five-letter word for the ultimate happiness peace and tranquillity?
"Death".
Well, Mother, what do you think of it now?
Well, it's attractive.
For what it is.
- And if Dennis is adamant about - Darrin, Mother.
Whatever his name is.
If he must buy a house, at least this is distinctively furnished.
- You won't have to change a thing.
- Oh, all of this goes.
You're not serious?
Well, of course I'm serious.
Now that I know what I want we'll furnish the house like ordinary people do: On time.
Well, come on, Mother, let's go look at the patio.
Well, I've seen about all I care to.
How about you?
Not me.
I'm gonna stay here and wait for Darrin and do it all over again.
Well, you don't mind if I fly along?
I'm glad you came with me.
I would've been unhappy if you hadn't.
I wouldn't be much of a mother if I deserted my daughter in her hour of need.
I wish you'd try to believe that I've never been happier than I am right now.
The honeymoon isn't quite over, Samantha.
It'll be a while before you can be held responsible for the things you say.
Well, I'll always feel the same, if I live a thousand years.
You could change your mind many times in a thousand years.
- I did.
- Well, I won't.
You'll see.
Now, that must be Darrin.
Don't go if you absolutely don't have to.
Maybe the two of you should meet right here and now.
Here?
Now?
In me carpet slippers?
You must be kidding.
Hi, honey.
- What do you think?
- I love it.
You mean it?
You're not saying that just to please me.
No, no, I love it.
It's a marvellous house and Mother loves it too.
- Mother?
- She's here.
- In there?
- You wanna meet her?
Yes, of course, of course, I wanna meet her.
Abner, I love you.
Why would I lie to you?
Take another spoonful, Gladys, you'll feel better.
Now open.
I won't open.
Listen to me.
We've watched that house ever since the day it was built.
You've watched that house since it was built.
I got better things to do.
Abner, that house has always been empty, been bango.
Okay, bango, take the medicine.
- It's full of furniture, just like that, full.
- Open.
- No more.
It's making me nauseous.
- Better nauseous than crazy, open.
I'm not crazy, Abner.
It was full of furniture, beautiful stuff, then bango!
- Bango, open.
- It was gone.
- Maybe it was repossessed, open.
- I'm going back there.
I'm scared, but I'm going back there.
I'm marching up and I'm gonna knock and find out what's going on in there.
Oh, she must have gone.
We didn't see her leave.
No, that's true.
We talked about furniture.
Something wonderful and comfortable, but nothing too cold or modern.
You're right.
I don't see her anywhere.
- Who?
- Your mother.
She can be seen, can't she?
Of course.
And she had some wonderful ideas about the dining room.
High cane-back chairs with velvet seats.
Well, if you don't like velvet seats I'm crazy about velvet seats.
As a matter of fact, I'm crazy about everything you like.
- You really mean that?
- Every word of it.
If you see a piece of furniture you like, you buy it and put it in.
I'll love it.
I don't want anything we haven't picked out together.
After all, we both are gonna live here, you know.
Well, that's the sort of arrangement I had in mind.
- There she is.
- Who?
Your mother.
You must have locked her outside.
- Oh, well, I'll let her in.
- No.
- I'll answer the door.
- Now, Darrin Mother may seem a bit different at first.
That's all right.
I'm perfectly at ease.
I want her to know I'd like to be friends and she'll always be welcome in our home.
Hello.
Welcome, Mother.
Mother?
That's that.
Incidentally, that woman you kissed and scared was Gladys Kravitz.
She and her husband, Abner, live across the street.
Well, as soon as we get settled, I'll go over and apologise.
I suppose it's better than getting the reputation of being standoffish.
Really.
There he is, Abner, that's the one who kissed me.
It don't make any sense.
He's got her.
Why would he wanna kiss you?
I love you, Mrs. Stephens.
And I love you, please believe that.
Believe me, it'll never work.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Did I startle you, darling?
Try a touch of bay leaf from India.
Have you ever thought of calling before you drop in, like other people?
I'm not like other people, Samantha.
Neither are you.
So will you please kindly tell me why you are wearing yourself out?
Mr. McMann and Mr. Tate thought it'd be nice to have Mr. Barker here for dinner.
Well, why don't they have him to dinner?
Because he's Darrin's account.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I am very busy.
There's an easier way to do that, you know.
I promised I wouldn't.
Oh, please, you're breaking my heart.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go and change.
Oh, well, go right ahead.
And I'd rather you didn't show up at the party tonight, if you don't mind.
Why should I?
I'm only your mother.
I won't be around forever.
Wanna bet?
Oh, hello, darling.
Mr. Barker's bringing a date?
Oh, no, no.
No trouble at all.
I miss you, sweetheart.
I miss you too, angel.
Yes, and I love you very much.
Bye-bye.
I sell baby food, Stephens.
I know.
You ever see my product?
Yes.
What'd you think of the label?
The way it's packaged?
Frankly, Mr. Barker, I think there's room for improvement.
I designed it myself.
I still think there's room for improvement.
- Did you open the can?
- I did.
- Taste the product?
- No, Mr. Barker.
I'm not crazy about baby food.
It's a little bland for my taste.
What's bland about strained bananas and squash with buttered beef hearts?
It's delicious.
In fact, it's so good, you hate to give it to your kid.
How about that, huh?
- What do you think of that?
- Of what?
The slogan.
" Barker's is so good, you hate to feed it to your child".
Well, I'd rephrase that, Mr. Barker.
"Barker's is so good you can hardly resist eating it yourself".
Something like that.
You like rephrasing things I say, don't you?
I like being honest.
You're pretty sure of yourself, huh?
I know my business, Mr. Barker.
This sort of campaign is most effective in slick magazines and in colour.
Look, I don't have too much time today.
- But you haven't seen any of this.
- Well, I'll take it with me.
See you tonight, huh?
We'll talk about it then.
Well, how'd we make out?
Well, I don't know.
He took the layouts.
Said we'd talk about it after dinner.
That's a good idea.
A man who's had a marvellous culinary experience topped off with a fine old brandy, is tremendously receptive.
We are going to have a marvellous culinary experience topped off with a fine old brandy, aren't we?
Yes, we are.
But we might be better off if we serve strained bananas and squash with buttered beef hearts.
Can I tell you something, honey?
- That little girl you married is a witch.
- Pardon?
I never saw a person that could throw together a dinner like this.
And she did it all by herself.
- It's like magic.
- She's very gifted that way.
Rex always tells me that with me it would take six weeks and 12 servants, and it still wouldn't turn out right.
You said "first-rate".
I presume you were referring to Stephens' portfolio.
No, I was referring to his wife.
Yes.
But about the campaign, did you have a chance to look it over?
I haven't even had a chance to look her over yet.
She's been in and out of that kitchen all evening.
Oh, there she is.
Oh, she's quite a girl.
Yep.
Mrs. Tate, can I get you something else?
No, thank you.
Oh, that was a marvellous dinner, Samantha.
Thank you so much.
How about a green mint or brandy?
Brandy sounds wonderful.
- Hi, there.
- Samantha.
We were just talking about you.
Can I fix you a drink?
I was just taking Mrs. Tate a brandy.
Well, here you are.
Give that to your wife, will you, Tate?
Well, of course.
- Now, what will you have?
- Oh, nothing, thank you.
Don't you ever slow down?
You haven't talked to me all evening.
- I have guests.
- And I'm one of them.
Why don't we take a stroll and get to know each other.
Know what I mean?
Yes, I think I do.
Well, good.
Son of a gun.
- You all right, honey?
- Well, a little tired.
- You're doing a great job.
- Oh, thank you, darling.
Everybody's raving about the dinner and you, especially Barker.
Meeting you might be the thing that gets us his account.
- You're not serious?
- Well, I certainly am.
Barker's very impressed with you.
You married me, therefore it follows I must be something very special.
Presto, he hands over the account.
Take it easy.
Peekaboo!
Mr. Barker, you scared me half to death.
Oh, I didn't mean to do that.
I just thought you forgot all about me.
Nothing of the kind.
You're not the sort of man a person could forget.
Oh, good.
Good.
Look, why don't we sit down and I'll freshen your drink.
I don't drink anymore.
I don't drink any less, but I don't drink any more.
Let's go inside, it's kind of chilly out here.
I don't wanna go inside.
I'm warning you, Mr. Barker, my husband is a very jealous man.
Well, I don't blame him.
I mean, so am I. Barker say anything to you about the account?
No.
Have you seen Samantha?
Yes, I think she went outside somewhere.
Please, Mr. Barker.
Mr. Barker, I'm warning you.
If you don't get control of yourself, I'm going to do something drastic.
Promise?
- What are you doing out here all alone?
- Oh, I'm not alone.
Where'd he come from?
Oh, he's been around all night, making a pest of himself.
Love-starved little beggar.
Yes, he certainly is.
Darrin, there's something I'd like to tell you.
Later, sweetheart, we have guests.
- Vicious for a little guy, isn't he?
- Yes, be careful.
Darrin Put him down.
You're supposed to be the host of this party, remember?
Come on, put him down.
Good night, Mrs. Tate.
- Yes, I will, Larry.
Good night.
- Thank you.
Good night.
Where were you when I was looking for you a little while ago?
I think I'll just take you out back.
Hey, isn't he cute?
Yes, you are, you shaggy little devil with that cold, wet nose.
He's adorable.
I'd like to take him home with me.
- Why don't you.
- Well, isn't he yours?
Just dropped in.
It probably belongs to one of the neighbours.
Never mind.
I'll take him.
I'll just put him No, sweetheart, I'll take him.
Well, thanks again for the marvellous dinner.
And stay out.
I'm still worried about Mr. Barker.
This isn't the first time I've had to drive myself home.
I'm used to it with Rex.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Well, honey, time to go to bed.
Honey?
- Yes, but what about him?
I ought to - Never mind about him.
I'll just go out and close the gate He found his way in, sweetheart, he can find his way out.
Oh, dear.
- What's the matter with that mutt?
- I'll go see.
Never mind, I will do it.
Yes, but, Darrin, I'm worried - I'll do it, sweetheart.
- It's so cold - I'll put on my robe.
- Yes, well But I could Wanna wake up the whole neighbourhood?
Oh, Mr. Barker, don't you ever give up?
I can't change you back here.
Darrin will It's no use.
We might as well let him stay till morning.
Oh, I don't think that's such a good idea.
- He'll get tired and curl up in a corner.
- I don't think so.
Wonder how he got in here.
Darrin you invited him.
- What?
I couldn't say anything in front of others, but I had to do it.
You had to do what?
Change Mr. Barker into a dog.
What kind of a joke is that?
Oh, it's no joke.
You see, he got very obnoxious.
Wait.
You're telling me you took a live person and turned him into a dog.
Yes.
Back up, I wanna get this straight.
You actually turned a human being into a dog.
Yes.
And that dog is Rex Barker?
Yes.
I can't believe it.
Well, I'm sorry, dear, but I had to do it.
You see, he was drunk.
Of course, that explains everything.
A drunken dog is better than a drunken man.
He trapped me in the garden and was making advances.
I had to do something.
You call that something?
That's my client.
You don't wanna even hear what happened.
I had the account all wrapped up.
What am I supposed to do now?
Bring Larry Tate a contract with Barker's paw print on it?
Will he remember any of this?
- No.
- Good.
Change him back.
Not until you listen to what I have to say.
I'll listen later.
Change him back.
Barker practically attacked me.
But that doesn't matter as long as you get him to sign with your agency.
What do you mean?
- He was very aggressive.
- You're exaggerating.
I am not!
Well, so maybe he had a few too many.
Any ordinary wife would know how to handle it.
But you had to turn him into an animal!
Well, he behaved like an animal.
He grabbed me and tried to bite me.
No wonder, look at the way you're dressed.
I wasn't dressed like this.
You are now.
Put something on, you're driving him crazy.
You're so concerned about him.
What about me?
What about you?
You're just a wife, he's a livelihood.
- And that's all you care about?
- Yes.
Fine, then that settles it.
Please leave this room.
Now, just a minute, Samantha, let's not fly off the handle.
Out.
This minute.
If that's the way you feel about it.
Just change him back.
- Never.
- Samantha.
- Out!
- Samantha!
Will you listen to me?
Samantha!
Samantha, open this door, do you hear me?
All right, have it your own way.
Sorry, old man.
Yes, Mother, what is it?
I just popped in to say I told you so.
Oh, that ridiculous husband of yours certainly is a sketch.
I almost split me bodice.
- What's that?
- Pussycat.
What's all the excitement?
That little pussycat won't hurt Mr. Barker.
- You call that a pussycat?
- What do you call it?
A mountain lion.
It'll tear Mr. Barker to shreds.
Where are you going?
To rescue that drunken dog.
If anything happened to him Darrin would never forgive me.
Oh, Mr. Barker.
What happened?
- Where am I?
- Well, we took a little stroll.
- I'm bleeding.
- Well, just a bit.
Now, you be sure and put something on that as soon as you get home.
You little spitfire, you.
Go ahead, scratch me again, see if I care.
Oh, Mr. Barker.
- My dog, he'll be killed.
- We'll get him.
Just don't get excited.
But you don't understand.
You see - Do you live around here?
- Yes.
- What's your name?
- Stephens.
Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
How come you're in your robe, Mrs. Stephens?
Robe?
Oh, yes.
Well, you see, I was taking my dog for a walk, and I wish you'd let me find him.
Something terrible Now, don't get excited, Mrs. Stephens.
I have to find that dog.
My husband's very fond of that animal.
We'll put out a call.
One of the cars will pick him up.
That's nice of you, but no, thank you.
I think I better just keep on looking.
You can't wander around the street like that, Mrs. Stephens.
We'll take you home, and when we find your dog, we'll call you.
I've been worried sick.
Where have you been?
Mr. Barker got in a fight and decided to leave.
- A fight with who?
- A cat.
A cat?
You mean, he's still He was.
- You changed him back?
- I did.
Well, is he all right?
I mean, did he say anything?
No, not a word.
The last time I saw him, he was in a hurry.
You think I ought to call the hotel?
No, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
He's gonna need all the rest he can get.
I guess you're right.
Sam, look, I was pretty upset tonight and probably said a lot of things in the heat of the moment.
I know exactly what you mean.
Forget it.
Good.
I'll get my blanket and join you.
That won't be necessary.
Hello, Sergeant Frost?
Oh, this is Mrs. Stephens again.
You found him?
He's where?
Dr. David Cook.
Yes.
Now, what's the address?
Fine, I'll pick him up right away.
Thank you, sergeant.
Scratches are nothing to worry about.
As soon as his beard grows in you won't even notice.
- Can I have him now?
I gave him a tetanus shot.
Let out quite a scream, the little fellow did.
- But it's for his own good.
- Doctor, I'm in a terrible hurry.
Oh, yes.
A shot and a bath and a first-rate clip comes to $27.
Will you please just send us a bill?
You have the address.
Hurry up and get him for me.
He's late for an important meeting.
- Meeting?
- Doctor, please.
Well, how does he look?
I can't imagine.
You'd think at least he'd have the courtesy to call.
Well, he put away a lot of booze last night.
All right, Mr. Barker, you're on your own.
- Yes?
- Mr. Bark er is in the conference room.
- We'll be right there.
- And your wife is on her way up.
Good, tell her to wait in my office.
I wanna see her.
Mr. Ba Hiya.
Say, that That must have been some party last night.
What did you do?
I don't know.
But whatever it was, I won first prize.
What happened to your hair?
I haven't the faintest idea.
It looks good.
Yeah.
You ought to see my chest.
It's all ruffled.
Why don't you sit down.
Yeah.
Seems like I backed into a cactus bush or something.
Is Babs sore about last night?
No.
On the contrary, she thought you were cute.
Look - Look, I need a little pick-me-up.
- The bar's in my office.
- I'll fix you something.
- No, look, I know where it is.
We'd like to get this contract buttoned down this morning.
You got a deal.
I like Stephens' work.
But give me a minute, will you?
This is an emergency.
Ruffles.
Mr. Barker?
Well, hello there.
- How are you feeling, Mr. Barker?
- Miserable, thanks.
But this will straighten me out.
A little hair of the dog that bit me.
- Know what I mean?
- Yes.
I usually drink it with carrot juice.
I get just as smashed, but I can see better after dark.
- You know, you really are a knockout.
- Mr. Barker, you're amazing.
Don't you ever get tired?
Never.
- Oh, I was just telling her about the - What are you doing?
- Protecting my wife.
- He was only with her for a minute.
- What could he have done?
- He was nibbling at her neck.
- You didn't have to hit him.
- What do you expect?
Well, use a little diplomacy.
When somebody insults my wife, that's as diplomatic as I get.
- You all right, sweetheart?
- Oh, I'm fine.
But you didn't have to do that.
Mr. Barker.
- I should have done it last night.
- Oh, you wouldn't hit a little dog.
- You were telling the truth.
Forgive me?
- Of course.
I won't.
That punch just cost this company half a million dollars.
- What will I tell the stockholders?
- Tell them I quit.
Come on, darling.
Well, what about him?
Why don't you call the pound.
Hi.
- What are you doing here?
- I just dropped by to tell you I signed with your outfit, provided you handle the account.
Expect me to work with you after what happened?
Oh, forget it.
I've got a problem.
Some of my best friends have knocked me cold.
Hey, listen, if you and your wife are ever in Columbus, Ohio, I Oh, forget it.
Sam.
- They want me back on the job.
- Well, I'm not surprised.
You didn't have anything to do with this?
Of course not, everybody wants you because you're the best.
- How about taking me out to celebrate?
- Good idea.
I'll get my hat.
Don't you dare move.
- Samantha.
- I know, I know, no hocus-pocus.
So sue me, it was worth it.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Among the more soul-satisfying suburban activities is that collaboration with nature that brings fragrance and beauty to the home.
; Horticulture.
Husbands appreciate their wives' efforts as they leave for their offices secure in the knowledge their mates are at home digging rather than in town shopping.
Patience, fortitude and loving care are rewarded by fragrant blooms sturdy and bursting with colour.
Providing, of course, you have the proper soil and a green thumb or unless you happen to be a witch.
To think I'd ever live to see the day a daughter of mine would be down on her knees in the dirt digging for onions.
I'm not digging for onions, I'm planting gladiolas.
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- Oh, now, Mother, don't be so stuffy.
Everybody plants flowers around their homes.
It's part of the scheme of things.
Anyway, it's fun planting seeds and watching flowers grow in a natural way.
Yes, I saw an exhibition of that natural growth this morning.
When whosis left for wherever it is he goes in the morning.
Well, I just didn't want to look a failure first time at bat.
First time at what?
- "Bat," Mother, it's an expression.
- Yes, I know what a bat is.
Those ugly flying things that people think we're always cooking.
Not that kind of bat, Mother.
A baseball bat.
I'm afraid you've lost me.
It's a game people play.
Haven't you ever seen it?
- Oh, don't be absurd, Samantha.
- Well, it's every exiting.
They play it with a ball and a big stick called a bat.
One man throws it to the man holding the bat, who tries to hit it.
Then everybody chases the ball, and the man who hits it runs in a circle on a field called a diamond before anyone tags him.
- You're not serious.
- Oh, yes.
- Darrin took me once.
- I don't believe it.
And the one who runs around the most wins the series.
Series of what?
- Nothing.
Just a series.
- That's typical.
Typical.
That's a human being for you.
Spend most of their lives running in circles for a series of nothing.
Would you like some coffee?
- Love some.
- I'll wash out the cups and saucers.
- Why?
- Because we only have two.
We haven't bought any dishes or silver or linen yet.
What sort of coffee do you have?
Fresh.
In the percolator, I made it myself.
No, thank you.
I think I'll have a cup of Turkish kawa this morning.
- It's delicious.
Have some?
- No, thank you.
- And I wish you wouldn't do that.
- Do what?
You know perfectly well what I'm talking about.
This is a normal household.
And I'm trying to avoid witchcraft wherever and whenever possible.
It's ridiculous, Samantha.
You are what you are.
You can't change that.
I'm not trying to change, I'm merely trying to adjust.
- He's trying to make you over.
- He's doing no such thing.
Samantha, one of these days you'll see that I'm right.
I detest sounding like one of those mothers who thinks they know it all.
But unfortunately I do.
- Get away from the window, Gladys.
- Look at that house, Abner.
There's something funny going on with that house.
Nothing funny, it's an ordinary house.
If one minute you saw trees growing and the next minute you saw nothing wouldn't you think something funny was going on?
If you heard lightning and whooshing noises all the time as if things were flying, wouldn't you think a minute before being so sure that everything was normal as blueberry pie, Abner?
- Move, Gladys.
- You're not listening.
- I'm listening.
- You're not interested.
I'm interested, keep talking.
Just move a little.
"Place cloves approximately 2 inches apart.
Sprinkle generously with brown sugar, then add ginger ale" Mother, Mother, hold it.
I have to get the cloves in first.
Of course, I'd forgotten you do everything the hard way now.
It isn't hard, it's fun.
Anyway, that oven practically does it for you.
All you have to do is set the dials for whatever time you want dinner I forgot to ask Darrin what time he'd be home.
I guess I'd better go to the village and call him.
What's the matter with your telephone?
- Hasn't been connected yet.
- Is that all?
There you are.
You can call now.
Well, just remember, you did it, I didn't.
Oh, hi, honey.
Well, I should be through here about 6:30 and home about 8.
I see you got the phone connected, huh?
No.
No, they won't be here until later this afternoon.
Bye, darling.
Bye, darling.
Move a little, would you mind, Gladys?
Do you have any idea how nervous I am about going over there today?
- Lf you're nervous, don't go.
- Well, I've got to.
I mean, we're part of the Welcome Wagon.
Shirley Clyde and June Foster and me, we're the committee and you know how they're dying to get in there and see the house.
Move left a little, I can't see the glass.
It wouldn't surprise me if none of us were ever seen again.
- What did you say?
- Oh, never mind.
Your shadow's on top of the ball, Gladys.
So help me!
I wish you'd cut this nonsense and develop a hobby.
- About 20 minutes per pound.
- Twenty-five would be better.
Why, Mother, I thought you didn't fool with mortal things like cooking.
What I said was I didn't believe in exerting myself.
I didn't say I didn't know how.
- Oh, I'll get it.
- Some of the girls coming to call.
- Oh, really?
- Snooping, no doubt.
I'm sure you won't mind if I make myself scarce for a bit.
- Coward.
- Discretion is the better part of valour.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
I'm June Foster.
This is Shirley Clyde and Gladys Kravitz.
- We're the Welcome Wagon Committee.
- Welcome to Morning Glory Circle.
Well, thank you very much.
Won't you come in?
You sure you're not busy with someone?
Maybe your mother, maybe your sister?
- No.
Not a soul here but me.
- No one?
- No.
- Oh, that's my boy, Robert.
- Robert, now you behave yourself.
- Oh, he's a nice-Iooking young fellow.
- Gracious.
- That's Shirley's son.
I see.
- Three.
- We don't know who he is.
Oh, he's cute.
We brought you this cake as sort of a housewarming gift.
- It's coffee cake.
- Why, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Do you have a maid with a large curly head around?
Sorry, no maid.
Now, children, if you aren't quiet, you can't stay in here.
No roughhousing, Stephen.
Don't touch things that don't belong to you.
- Put that back wherever you found it.
- That's perfectly all right.
Why don't you sit in the living room and make yourselves comfortable while I put the cake in the kitchen.
- Why don't we all go into the kitchen?
- We wouldn't mind at all.
- Of course not.
After all, we're really not company and your nice things will probably have to last you for a long, long time.
Boys, all right, get up.
Now don't get into mischief.
Oh, that's love - Would you like some cake and coffee?
- We'd love some.
Where are the cups?
Cups?
Not your good cups, of course.
Right over there in the cupboard.
That's bone china.
We haven't unpacked the good stuff yet.
- I can't seem to find the silverware.
- Silver?
Well, it's right there in the drawer to your left.
- I thought I looked there.
- Well, look again.
Napkins, ladies?
- Hi there, lady.
- How do you do?
I'm Black Bob, the fastest gun in the West.
- I'm an Indian.
He's a horse.
- Who are you?
I'm a witch.
- Okay.
- You a good witch or a bad witch?
Here come the bad guys.
Little boy, here now.
Little boy, here now.
Of course, we don't want a freeway coming through this area.
Then on Monday, you're going with us to picket the construction.
I will?
Do you have a gardener that works in pyjamas?
What?
We're forming teams of two girls each.
Shirley and I are leading picketing teams, and Gladys will stand by in case someone has to sit down in front of the cement mixer.
- Me?
Why me?
- We voted.
- Nobody told me.
- It was a secret ballot.
Then, of course, you'll help us with the refreshments and - The boys are awfully quiet.
- Yes, isn't that nice?
Boys are always dangerous when they're quiet.
- Let's check into this.
- Yes.
Yes, of course.
Nobody asks me.
They just say, "Gladys, go sit down in front of a cement mixer".
What are you boys up to?
There was a witch in here, and she tied us up.
- Yeah.
- Oh, that'll be enough of that.
I think we better take them home.
They're getting pretty tired.
- Oh, I understand.
- How did three of them get tied up?
Oh, I'm so sorry.
For goodness sakes, what is this?
- Calm down and don't get rowdy.
- Shirley.
How do you suppose all three of them got tied up?
Boys will be boys.
But if two are tied up, who ties up the third?
Stephen, stop pushing.
He's smaller than you are.
- Shirley, if you had two kids - Just a minute, Gladys.
- Don't run into the street.
What is it?
- Not so loud, Shirley.
What's the matter with you?
Don't yell, I'm just asking you a simple question.
- Mrs. Clyde, the boys are in the street.
- Oh, of course.
Oh, boy, I really don't know about this.
Stephen, I told you not to run.
If he gets perspired he gets the flu.
I better take him home.
Please come back again another time.
Abner, you won't believe it when I tell you what just happened.
It's Gladys.
If you don't think this is a crazy house, well, listen to this: Three kids just got tied up in the bedroom.
Do you hear me, three!
So what?
I'll tell you so what.
How did all three of them get tied up, Abner?
Tell me that.
You don't understand.
Two kids are tied up in the bedroom and one kid isn't tied up.
That's normal, but not three kids tied up.
Never mind, Abner.
Never mind.
I should know better than to talk to you, never mind.
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Mrs. Stephens is in the living room.
Well, I'm here to connect the telephones.
- Well, go right ahead.
- Thank you.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Foster.
Thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
Maybe next week, I'll take you to our decorator.
- He can do wonders for you.
- Thank you, that's very kind.
Robert!
Thanks for everything, Mrs. Stephens.
I had a wonderful time.
- Oh, please come back again soon.
- Oh, sure, sure.
Oh, by the way, I let in the phone repairman to hook up your telephones.
Thank you.
To hook up your telephones?
!
The phone was not connected.
May I never get off this couch again if the phone was connected.
Gladys, don't get excited, you'll melt the cubes too fast.
You think I'm cuckoo, don't you?
Gladys, you called me about two kids who were tied up in a bedroom.
- Three kids.
Three kids were tied up.
- Don't yell, Gladys.
If two kids were tied up, I wouldn't have had to call you, don't you understand?
Sure, Gladys.
Then you believe me that the phone was not connected?
- Want me to call the doctor?
- It wouldn't do any good.
- Why not?
- He doesn't believe me either.
I told you, Samantha, that you wouldn't like being part of the animal world.
They're not animals, Mother.
They're human beings.
Yes, of course.
Granted, the most intelligent of animals.
And as Diogenes said, also the silliest.
Or was it Diogenes?
It was one of those young good-Iooking Greeks who talked an awful lot.
Mother, you must believe that Darrin isn't like that.
- Like what?
- The average human.
He's not covetous or envious or inconsiderate.
Are you trying to convince me or yourself?
I think it's time the two of you met face to face.
Oh, really?
Would you have dinner with us tonight?
Well, I don't know.
Still it might be fun at that.
You wouldn't do anything startling, would you?
Why?
Does what's-his-name have a weak heart?
His name is Darrin, Mother.
D-A-R-R-l-N.
And he's in perfectly good health.
And I want him to like my mother.
What sort of mother do you think he'd prefer?
Lavender and old lace?
Pioneer stock, perhaps?
Old World?
New World?
What would you prefer?
Very funny, very funny.
But I'd prefer you on time.
Oh, my ham.
Now, Mother, please say you'll come.
Well, I suppose I might as well get it over with.
Yes, I'll come.
And I prefer the natural you.
And so will Darrin.
I wonder.
- You are very pretty.
- That's not quite the right expression.
You are very pretty.
I'm very handsome.
What time did your mother say she'd be here?
- Any time now.
Can I make you a drink?
- Definitely.
Having a plain mother-in-law is a new experience to me but having a mother-in-law who's a - I mean, do you resemble her?
- No, I look like my father.
What does your mother look like?
Well, she's 5'6" and weighs about 118 pounds.
- Well, sounds normal.
- What do you mean?
Well, I mean, it looks It sounds like she looks normal.
- What do you expect her to look like?
- How would I know?
- Well, you know what I look like.
- Well, that's no proof.
- Proof of what?
- Proof that she doesn't have Well, a Well, what sort of eyes does she have?
They're blue.
All five of them.
You're kidding.
Why do humans care more about what people look like than what they are?
It's not that at all, Sam.
What difference does it make what my mother looks like?
- I'm merely trying to prepare myself.
- For what?
I don't know if like the idea of a mother-in-law with five blue eyes.
Oh, don't be idiotic.
Oh, idiotic am I?
Well, let me tell you something, Sam She's here.
- Well, she didn't fly down the chimney.
- Lf you're going to be insulting I'm sorry, Sam, I I didn't mean to say that, it's just that well, I'm nervous.
- Will you answer the door or shall I?
I'll answer it.
Ask her to leave her broom outside.
Good evening.
Good evening.
Won't you come in?
Samantha.
- This must be what's-his-name.
- Mother, this is my husband.
This is Darrin.
We were having a drink.
Would you care for a cocktail?
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
Well, I'd like it much better if you'd call me by my first name.
- Very well, Dennis.
- Darrin, Mother.
Oh, of course.
I'd like a very dry martini.
Italian vermouth, Spanish gin and a Greek olive.
- Well, I don't think we have any - Oh, don't bother.
I'll fix it myself.
It's marvellous.
Marvellous.
Now, young man, suppose you tell me all about yourself.
What you do and why do you do it.
Et cetera, et cetera.
Well, I'm in the advertising business.
I'm with a firm called McMann & Tate.
Really, isn't that interesting.
Pardon me, do you have a cigarette?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
You were saying?
Our firm handles some rather large accounts.
Thank you, I have a light.
Darrin's firm is one of the largest advertising agencies in the world and Darrin's one of its top executives.
That sounds very exciting.
Samantha, may I have that ashtray?
Oh, yes, certainly.
And Darrin is responsible for all of the creative designs for their campaigns.
- What on earth did you do that for?
- Do what?
You carried that ashtray to me.
Don't tell me you've forgotten how to levitate.
Of course I haven't forgotten, Mother.
It's just that Darrin prefers that I don't do any of that stuff anymore.
Why do you object to my daughter being herself, young man?
I don't object, Mrs You'll never be able to pronounce it.
Just call me Endora.
I like Samantha the way she is, Endora.
She doesn't need any of that other nonsense.
- Nonsense?
- Darrin doesn't mean anything.
Darrin, please.
I mean, we don't need those powers of hers.
We can handle things very well by ourselves.
Oh, you think so, do you?
I don't mean to be disrespectful, but we wanna live normal lives.
What is normal to you, young man, is to us asinine.
Samantha is what she is, and that you cannot change.
Mother, I made the decision myself.
Yes, I know.
A decision I do not approve.
Samantha and I can handle our problems by ourselves.
- They're nobody else's business.
- Darrin, please.
- Are you threatening me?
- Not exactly.
Darrin, please understand.
Mother means well.
Don't you worry, baby, your mother will see to it that you're treated properly.
I have every intention of treating her properly without interference from you.
- Young man!
- Mother, don't.
Very well.
Just consider yourself lucky that you are not at this moment an artichoke.
So from now on, watch your step, young man.
Mother is watching you.
She's really very nice when you get to know her.
- Abner!
- Gladys, what are you doing?
She went away in a puff of smoke, I saw her.
One minute she was there.
The next minute she was gone.
What's the matter with you?
Suddenly I'm married to a Peeping Tom.
Spying, sticking your nose in everybody's business.
Go back to bed!
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Go ahead, say anything you want.
Insult me, call me cuckoo, kill me, I don't mind.
And you know why, sweetheart, because I know this is all a dream.
Oh sure, sure, I suppose I look like some sort of a freak to you because I wanna live what is to me a normal existence.
Darrin, I didn't say that.
I understand how you feel.
Whatever it is you want, that's what I want too.
- Are you absolutely sure, Sam?
- Yes.
- What about your mother?
- She'll get used to the idea.
Anyway, you married me, not my mother.
Say, could she?
I mean, really turn me into an artichoke?
If she wanted to.
That's creepy.
What could you do?
I mean, if she did?
- Nothing.
Except - Except what?
I could become an artichoke too.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Good morning, darling.
Or should I be more specific and say, "Good 4:00 in the morning"?
- What are you doing up so early?
- I'm not up early.
I'm up late.
One party after another.
I haven't been to bed yet.
And neither have you, apparently.
Well, it's typical, typical.
- Of what?
- Of the neglected housewife drinking coffee, eaten alive by suspicion her husband out till the wee small hours of the morning, doing whatever it is he's doing.
- Darrin's working in the study.
You're joking.
No.
He's been working till the wee small hours every night this week.
Oh, well.
Lust is lust, I suppose.
Whether it's for women or money, it's all the same.
It has nothing to do with lust.
He's creating a new campaign for Caldwell's Soup.
Ambition.
Thoroughly immoral and foolishly mortal.
Darrin's a very dedicated man.
So was Caesar, and all it got him was a torn toga.
He was such a nice man too.
If you'll excuse me, I'm going to take Darrin some coffee.
Very well.
And you can tell what's-his-name that any man with a wife like you who spends every night with a can of soup must be even less than human.
Sweetheart, you've been up all night.
You'll get sick.
I will not get sick.
I am sick.
Well, nothing's worth your killing yourself.
I won't have this.
Don't worry, sweetheart, I'll be fine.
- What time is it?
- About 8:30.
Eight-thirty, I'll miss the train.
Excuse me, honey, I have to take my shower.
Darrin?
What's this sudden urgency about Caldwell's Soup anyway?
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I can't hear a word you're saying.
"What was good enough for Dad is good enough for me".
"Always a winner, Caldwell's Soup".
"Game called on account of soup".
Oh, that's very clever.
You understand what I mean, honey?
Competition.
At one time Caldwell's Soup was the only packaged soup on the market.
Now there are 40 brands.
Would you get my suit that just came from the cleaners?
- Sure.
- And a clean shirt, please, honey.
- I think those layouts are cute.
- Cute?
Uninspired, pedestrian trash, that's what they are.
But they're close.
Just misses it, misses.
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.
I don't know what you're worried about.
After all, you are the best advertising man in the world.
Thank you, honey.
Up till today, I wouldn't argue the point.
But in advertising, you're just as good as your last battle.
Caldwell's sales are falling off.
They're ready to go to another agency.
Well, I don't think that's fair.
You've been selling their soup for so long.
Old man Caldwell keeps yammering about being so close to the forest you can't see the trees.
You'll get it, I know you will.
It had better be before noon, because I'm having lunch with Caldwell.
I don't know.
Maybe I'm losing my touch.
Darrin?
Suppose you use some familiar expressions with double meanings.
For instance instead of a farmer make this fellow a fisherman.
Put in a background like the sea and instead of chicken okra make it bouillabaisse and the billboard could read: "A pretty kettle of fish".
A pretty kettle of fish.
A pretty kettle of fish.
Now, for instance, in the poker game maybe you could take out the lady - Yeah.
put the soup in the middle of the table and this one could read: "The pot's right".
- The pot's right.
Caldwell's Soup.
- Like it?
It's perfect.
Now, this one instead of baseball hats and gloves they could wear astronaut helmets and carry jet planes and the billboard could read: - "The race for space - Yeah?
at the table - Yeah?
when you serve Caldwell's Soup".
- How about that?
- Incredible.
You really like it?
They're the answer to all the problems.
These will cinch the account.
- Here, sweetheart, put them in here.
- Oh, okay.
There you go.
Thank you, honey.
These will knock Old man Caldwell right on his Of course, why didn't I see it before?
It was you.
- You did it.
- Did what?
Lay out a solution of the campaign and hand it to me on a silver platter.
I was only trying to help.
Sam, I don't want that kind of help.
I told you, magic was out.
- But there was no magic in what I did.
- Well, what would you call it?
I'd call it imagination.
I do have some, you know.
Come on, Sam.
I don't have that kind of imagination, and I'm a professional.
- Darrin, all I tried to do was - I know what you tried to do.
And from now on, keep your miracles to yourself.
Well, I don't know, I don't know.
It just doesn't What we're trying to do, Mr. Caldwell, is update your campaign.
Make it appeal more to the modern eye.
Well, I'm not so sure I care to appeal to the modern eye.
I like to think there's a good bit of old-fashioned romance left in the world.
So would I, Mr. Caldwell, but the people in your sales department feel that in order to sell, we have to keep up with the times.
They're right, of course, yes, but I'm from the old school.
You know what I mean?
What was good enough for Dad was good enough for me.
- You get what I mean?
- Yes, sir, I do.
That's why I thought that this layout of the old-fashioned kitchen farm kitchen, would appeal to you.
Note that caption.
That caption.
"What was good enough for Dad is good enough for me".
No, it's no good.
Now, let me tell you why we've got to look in another area.
He's not buying, buddy.
He's not buying.
Samantha's ideas could cinch the whole deal for you.
Tell him.
Go ahead, tell him.
It just misses making the point.
You get what I mean, Stephens?
Stephens?
Stephens?
Oh, yes.
I do see.
Perhaps this will more closely illustrate what you're trying to get.
"Always a winner".
Well, it does have something.
But then again, it doesn't have anything else, you get what I mean?
You see, when a group of men get together playing poker they're not thinking of buying soup.
- Don't fight it.
Tell him Samantha's slogan for the layout.
It's a natural.
What's the difference who thought of it first?
Are you with me, Stephens?
Stephens, I say, are you with me?
- Oh, yes.
Yes, sir.
- Well, that'll help.
How about this one?
Specially designed for kid appeal.
Kid appeal?
Now, kids aren't interested in buying soup.
We have to make them soup-conscious.
You'll never do it.
As far as kids are concerned, what isn't bubble-gum is medicine.
You're losing him.
In about 10 seconds, he's going to walk.
And what have you proved?
That you've got pride and integrity and you're stupid?
- To close to the trees, my boy.
- Trees?
What I mean is that you have had our account for a long time, Stephens.
Don't worry about it.
We all strike out once in a while.
I wouldn't exactly say that, Mr. Caldwell.
You don't have to apologise at all.
No one is perfect.
Oh, look at that, 2:00.
I had no idea it was so late.
- I've got to get going.
- Mr. Caldwell.
Yes, what is it?
Nothing, it's no good.
Well, let me be the judge of that.
What were you going to say?
If I do it once, I'll do it again.
And before you know, I won't be able to do anything for myself.
Well, that's an interesting philosophy.
But I don't see how it applies to soup.
You take care of the check, will you?
Good morning, darling.
What's this supposed to mean?
Well, you enjoy working like a horse I thought you might enjoy looking like one.
Oh, very funny.
Now, why don't you go away.
I've had about all the sarcasm I can take for one day.
Oh, really?
- Trouble in paradise, eh?
- Nothing we can't work out.
- Besides, it was all my fault.
- That's a wonderful attitude, Samantha.
We haven't had a martyr in the family since the Salem trials.
What did you do to what's-his-name, besides bruise his ego a bit?
- Isn't that enough?
- Nonsense.
It isn't nonsense.
He thought my ideas were witchcraft.
- Well, weren't they?
- No!
But he doesn't believe me.
He never will.
I told you it would be impossible for you to be a help to him.
He doesn't need my help.
He did very well before I came along.
And he'll do very well without you, I agree.
Now, don't you put words in my mouth, I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna stay here, and I'm gonna clean this house with my own hands.
Then I'm gonna start dinner, and then I'm gonna take a bath and put on the sexiest dress I own.
When my husband comes home, I'll have a drink with him and spend the evening convincing him he was right and I was wrong and from now on I'm gonna mind my own business.
- To err is human, to forgive divine.
- Exactly.
When you're up to hear in err and you've changed into one huge lump of divine don't say I didn't warn you.
Hi, darling.
- Hello, honey.
- Oh, you must be dead.
- Did you have a hard day?
- Oh, no.
I often lose the agency's biggest accounts.
Two or three a week sometimes.
- Darrin, you didn't have an idea?
- No, and I didn't use yours either.
Well, I thought you might in an emergency.
You have almost as much faith in my lack of integrity as you have in my lack of talent.
- Darrin, please.
Well, you weren't entirely wrong.
I thought about spreading out your miracle before him to save my own face, but I bit my tongue.
You see that?
I let him walk out on me in spite of all your influence.
What do you mean by that?
I could feel you there in the restaurant prodding and digging at my conscience.
Well, I haven't been anywhere near your conscience.
All day, I've been here at home.
I've vacuumed and scrubbed and cleaned.
And I made dinner.
- Well, big deal.
- What does that mean?
Well, I've seen the way you can, wham, wash and, pow, clean and ring-a-ding up a dinner.
Well, I didn't wham, pow or ring-a-ding up anything.
These are bona fide dishpan hands.
You could've whipped that up too, for appearance.
- Are you calling me a liar?
- Lf the shoe fits.
Sam.
Samantha!
Samantha, listen to me.
- Samantha, unlock this door.
- It's not locked.
Now, listen to me, Samantha, l Now, cut this out, Sam, l I wanna see you immediately.
Sam, you're my wife, I demand that you appear before me.
Now, didn't you hear what I said?
Sam, this isn't going to prove anything.
You're merely being supersensitive and obstinate.
Now, listen to me.
Don't do anything that you may regret later on.
Now, Sam, cut this out.
This is ridiculous.
Sam, I've had enough of this.
Sam!
Sam, now, cut this out.
Samantha, put that back.
Where do you think you're going?
You're not leaving this house.
She couldn't.
Samantha, come back here.
Samantha!
Samantha!
Samantha, come back here, do you hear me?
All right, have it your way.
My poor baby.
- He called me a liar.
- I know.
I heard the whole thing.
- I don't want to say I told you so - Then don't.
There, there, dear.
You just hold on to Mother, and we'll go far, far away.
And before we do I think I'll change him into a horned toad.
Mother, please don't.
Maybe you're right.
Why make it easy for him?
I think I'll leave him just as he is.
Darrin.
I've got six memos on my desk from the legal department reminding me about Caldwell's renewal.
How'd your lunch go yesterday?
Did you?
Are you awake?
I have been all night.
You look terrible, what's happened?
Nothing much, I just lost the Caldwell account and my wife all in one week.
What?
- That's horrible.
- I know, I can't believe it.
Your wife too, huh?
Oh, well, it's par for the course for newlyweds.
It'll work out.
- But what about Caldwell?
- Well, what do you want me to do?
The man can't recognise a good campaign when he sees one.
All right, but I better get someone else busy on the account.
And don't feel too badly about it.
It happens to all of us.
- I don't care about Caldwell.
- I was talking about your wife.
Don't feel too badly about Caldwell either.
You got a great batting average.
You gotta whiff one once in a while.
I didn't whiff anything.
I was right on top of it.
I just came up too late with the answers, that's all.
What do you mean, too late?
It's never too late.
If you got the answer, tell me.
We can still hold the account.
I could lock up Caldwell in two minutes if I wanted to.
If you wanted to?
Don't you want the sun to rise tomorrow morning?
Don't you wanna live to a ripe old age?
Don't you want me to live till tomorrow?
Don't you want the most important person in the world to come back to you?
- Of course I want her to come back.
I mean Caldwell.
All right, take a look at those layout boards on the desk.
There's your campaign.
Go ahead, live.
"The race for space at the table".
"The pot's right".
"A pretty kettle of fish".
Darrin, this stuff is great.
You're a genius, you hear me?
You're a 100 percent unadulterated genius.
I'll have Caldwell back in 10 minutes.
He'll get down on the floor and kiss your feet.
- And, Darrin, get yourself cleaned up.
- I'll try.
"A race for space at the table when you serve Caldwell's leek and potato".
"The pot's right, Caldwell's Soup".
"A pretty kettle of fish".
Mr. Caldwell, this campaign is not only clever and humorous, but it has taste.
That soupçon of something extra that Caldwell's Soups always looks for.
Darrin Stephens, I take my hat off to you.
I don't like it.
- You don't like it?
- It's gimmicky.
- Gimmicky?
- Gimmicky.
Did you say you didn't like it?
That's right, it has no good old-fashioned romance in it.
You mean you really don't like it?
- No warmth, no love, no sex.
- Sex?
I don't suppose there are many of us who look upon soup as having sex appeal, but I do.
I always will.
- And you're not going to buy it.
- I'm sorry, Stephens.
That's marvellous!
- What's the matter with you?
- You wouldn't understand, Larry.
Mr. Caldwell, are you absolutely sure you won't change your mind?
- Absolutely.
- Mr. Caldwell, I'm eternally grateful.
Wait a minute.
Have you become completely uncorked?
- Where are you going?
- I'm taking the rest of the day off.
There's something I've got to do before it's too late.
And thanks again, Mr. Caldwell.
That's perfectly all right.
That's Mr. Caldwell, before you leave, I can assure you that McMann & Tate will come up with a campaign that will be everything you expect it to be.
I know that we can deliver.
And I know that you'll buy.
I hope not.
It would be a shame to make that poor boy unhappy again.
Sam?
Sam?
Sweetheart?
Sam, I don't know where you are or if you can even hear me but I want you to know, I apologise for being willful, self-centred and stupid.
I was wrong.
From start to finish all the way down the line.
Since you left, I haven't been able to think about anything but you.
Nothing means anything to me.
I love you, Sam.
I miss you.
I wish you'd come home.
Hi.
Sam.
I'm glad to see you.
- Where have you been?
- Not far.
I'm sorry, Sam.
I should've known you wouldn't lie to me.
- What made you change your mind?
- Caldwell wouldn't buy the campaign.
What do you mean, he wouldn't buy the campaign?
I mean he wouldn't buy the campaign, so it must have been your imagination.
- Your ideas were no good.
- I don't think that's very nice.
I'm don't mean that your ideas are no good or that you don't have You know.
- I know what you mean, I understand.
It doesn't matter.
The only thing that's important is that I love you.
And I love you.
It seems ridiculous that a can of soup could ever come between us.
Nothing ever will again.
What did you just say?
I said, the only thing that was important is that I loved you.
- No, after that.
You said something.
- I don't know.
When?
- Why didn't I think of that?
- What are you talking about?
You just said You're sure you don't know what you said?
- About what?
- Never mind.
Never mind.
Sam, I've got it.
And it's perfect.
It's more than perfect.
It is inspired.
And you inspired it.
- I did?
- Yes, you did.
You inspired it and I found it, and that's the way it ought to be.
- Where you going?
- To see Caldwell.
But I'll be back before you know it.
I love you, Sam.
Won't give up, eh?
What do you think he'd say if he knew you had given him a hint?
He does know.
I inspired it and he found it.
You heard him say so.
- You're splitting hairs, Samantha.
- No, not at all.
That's the way it should be.
You heard him say that too.
Anyway, all you can ask of anyone is to take a little and make it go a long, long way.
Good.
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- Breathtaking.
You know, I come down here every once in a while just to sit and stare.
It's kind of old-fashioned and romantic, isn't it?
It's wonderful.
And I'm very proud of you.
Thank you, sweetheart.
"The only thing that will ever come between us".
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
And I give you my personal guarantee, finer merchandise does not exist.
- These are the finest bristles made.
- No thank you.
I already have a broom.
Believe me, lady, you can always use an extra one.
No thank you.
Toothbrushes, polish your smile.
Never know when people are gonna drop in.
No, really.
The barbeque, extra stiff bristles for the barbeque.
I told you, I already have all the brooms and brushes I can use.
That's impossible, lady, no housewife ever has enough brooms and brushes.
All right, see for yourself.
Sweetheart, no breakfast for me.
I won't have time.
But, Darrin I'm late, honey.
Something happened to the alarm.
You might as well relax, dear, you missed your train already.
I have?
How do you know?
- Have you been?
- No, no.
It's watchcraft, not witchcraft.
Well, the next train isn't till 9:30.
Oh, dear, isn't that a shame.
Well, I guess they'll just have to muddle through at the office without you for an hour.
Okay, and I'll just muddle around here for a while.
Save my place.
I'll be right back.
Well, good morning.
What can I do for you?
Look, son, I've got a lot on my mind this morning so Well, hello, Marshall.
What a surprise.
How come?
I'm here every morning.
Who's he?
I live here, that's who I am.
Who are you?
That's Marshall, he lives down the street.
I see.
You overshot your mark.
It's okay.
I can stay for breakfast.
But you better not kiss me because I've got a cold I think.
He's got a problem.
He's got a problem?
What is he doing here?
I'm his only friend in the neighbourhood.
Well, you're my only wife, and I thought we'd have a nice breakfast together.
Anything I can do, Mrs. Stephens?
No, no, Marshall.
You go and sit down.
Breakfast is ready.
"Anything I can do, Mrs. Stephens"?
Darrin, now, try to understand.
He's an unhappy little boy with a nervous, overprotective mother and no father.
So he comes over here every morning to play with you.
I knew you'd understand.
- I certainly do.
You're interfering.
- What do you mean?
His problems are none of your business.
- I'm merely being his friend.
- I know you, Samantha.
Oh, really?
You only look vaguely familiar to me.
No thank you.
My mother says I'm allergic to strawberries.
- What happens when you eat them?
- I don't know.
I never had any.
Samantha, his mother does not want him to eat strawberries.
Boy, they sure look good.
How about some juice, Marshall?
That's right, you can't have that either.
Too acid.
Or French toast, too rich, or sausage or I don't mind much about the juice.
Marshall, why don't you go on home and ask your mother if you can try one strawberry.
- She'll say no.
- How do you know?
She always says no.
Besides, she doesn't know I'm here.
I'm supposed to be in my room nursing the cold I'm probably getting.
- Your face isn't flushed.
- I'm not even sniffling yet.
- See?
- You don't have a fever.
Samantha, his mother says he has a cold.
Yes, dear, I know.
I just meant that his eyes look perfectly all right.
But his mother says he has a cold.
And she is his mother, isn't she?
Oh, yes, she certainly is.
Marshall!
I'm being come after.
Marshall!
Here I am, Ma!
She can run two blocks in 27 seconds with high heels on.
Marshall, I've been just frantic.
What are you doing here?
I'm Mrs. Stephens, this is my husband, Mrs. Burns.
Marshall was just visiting.
How do you do?
I told you to stay in your room.
You have a cold.
If you're too young to realise how dangerous it is to run around with a cold I should think at least an adult would recognise it.
But he isn't even sniffling.
I'm sure there was no great damage done.
But Marshall shouldn't have disobeyed you.
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
I'm glad to see that at least you are a sensible person.
Mrs. Burns, all I tried to do was You have no children, Mrs. Stephens.
That's quite obvious.
- Oh, it is?
- We've only been married a short time.
Because if you did, you'd realise that their health is something precious that has to be constantly guarded.
I raise my Marshall very carefully.
And I do not appreciate interference from anybody.
Please remember that.
Come along, Marshall.
- Samantha.
- Bye-bye, Marshall.
Come back any time.
Sam, don't you think you ought to try to get your mind off that boy?
I can't help it.
Every time I think of him Ionely, no friends, can't play with other children They're all carriers, you know.
Sam, I'm just as sorry for that kid as you are.
But he's not our responsibility.
The best thing we can do is to discourage him from hanging out here.
- His mother has certain ideas and - Like strawberries are poisonous.
- That's her opinion.
- So is French toast.
- And so is French toast.
- And baseball is a dangerous game.
And baseball is a Dangerous game?
- Baseball?
- I knew you would.
- Knew I'd what?
- Help him with his baseball.
- Not if his mother doesn't - But, Darrin Samantha, he's not our son.
Well, if we ever do have a son and I get the silly notion baseball is dangerous I certainly hope someone will see to it that your son doesn't miss the Junior League tryouts tomorrow afternoon.
I am playing golf tomorrow afternoon.
I'm not.
- Samantha, will you please - Yes, I will.
I knew you'd want me to go with him.
And if he makes the team, his mother will change her mind.
- Thank you, darling.
- Samantha, baseball is not the issue.
I don't wanna talk about baseball anymore.
You?
All right, buddy, right in here.
Give it right to him.
Little high.
Now remember, when you get out there, all you need is confidence.
- You're as good as you think you are.
- Oh, I think I'm pretty good.
Trouble is, I know I'm pretty bad.
- Go on.
- Okay, let's try it again, Freddy.
- How do you do, Mrs. Stephens?
- Oh, hello.
I'm Gladys Kravitz, your neighbour.
Remember?
Yes, of course.
How are you, Mrs. Kravitz?
I didn't know you were interested in Junior League baseball.
Oh, yes, I came with a friend.
That's my nephew, Floyd, down there.
Oh, really, which one?
The beautiful one at bat.
You can practically see his eyelashes from here.
Belt it, Floyd!
Nobody can pitch to him.
Okay, Jimmy, that's enough.
Come on in.
Okay, Burns, mound.
Next time you'll do it, son.
Okay, let's see what you can do today.
You're not serious.
Marshmallow Burns?
His name is Marshall.
- Oh, is that your friend?
- It is.
Oh, I didn't mean to laugh.
But, well - Well, what?
- He's always been afraid of baseball.
He's afraid of his own shadow.
Okay, let's see what you can do.
Right into his target.
Come on, Marsh.
That's okay.
Once more now.
Right in there, put it right to him.
Well, you see what I mean.
He can't play.
He's just a little slow getting started, that's all.
Once more.
Get it right into his target.
Choke up on your bat.
Watch the ball, Floyd.
That's my Floyd!
Well, maybe if you worked with Marshmallow Marshall a little bit Up to now I've done everything that was humanly possible.
Did you see that?
Mrs. Kravitz, you ain't seen nothing yet.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
Darrin, Marshall made the team.
- You went to the tryouts today.
- Yes.
And Coach Gribben says he's gonna be a triple threat.
- Know what that means?
- I certainly do.
It means all three of us are in trouble when his mother finds out.
I should think she'd be proud of him.
I was and you would've been too.
You should've seen Gladys Kravitz.
Her nephew is the star of the team.
Up until now that is.
Just how much did you have to do with the athletic awakening of Marshall Burns?
- I just gave him confidence.
- What else did you give him?
- What else is there?
- Oh, well there's that: And there's that: And probably a few other rituals I'm not familiar with yet.
Oh, Darrin, really.
"Oh, Darrin, really, yes"?
Or "Oh, Darrin, really, no"?
Because if you did, Samantha, you did that kid a big disservice.
He's playing in the opening game.
You can't follow him around the rest of his life wiggling and twitching at him.
You've given him false security.
I just tried to get him started.
After he plays for a while, he'll have a chance to improve and get his confidence back.
He won't need me.
But, Sam, suppose it doesn't work that way.
Suppose the boy What's that?
The backyard gate.
Someone's in the yard.
I'll go with you.
- Marshall.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Stephens.
- What are you doing here?
- Running away from home.
Why?
Because it's a big, wide, wonderful world.
Lots of places to see and things to do.
And my mother won't let me play on the team.
Well, why not?
Bats get thrown, the ball is hard, the grass is wet, the sun is hot.
Okay, I get the picture.
Let's go.
- Where are we going?
- Inside to call his mother so she can come and take him home.
- Where's Marshall?
- He's perfectly all right.
He's in the den watching television.
I thought it might give us a chance to talk.
I don't know how he got out of the house.
- What's he doing here?
- He was running away, Mrs. Burns.
Running away?
Why?
Because you've got him wrapped in cotton batting and he's smothering.
Samantha, Mrs. Burns may be a very cautious and concerned mother, but Concerned?
Well, I don't understand either one of you.
If you were concerned, you'd know how important it is for a boy his age to have friends, to be part of a gang, to be accepted.
You should've seen his face when he told me he made that team.
- It made me want to cry.
- I've told you not to interfere.
Mrs. Burns has every right to choose her boy's activities.
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
I'm glad to see that you understand.
I do.
You've gotta watch these kids every minute.
And incidentally, I'd have that trellis removed from the side of the house.
- Trellis?
- Yes, he told us that's how he got out.
Climbing down that fragile trellis.
Oh, no.
I can't believe it.
That's a favourite means of escape for most boys.
Used it myself.
That's very kind of you to let me know.
- I'll have it removed immediately.
- Traitor.
Of course, it might be easier if you put locks on his window.
- Locks?
- Probably be cheaper too.
And a lock on his door with only one key.
That way it'd be impossible for him to get out.
- I don't think that will be necessary.
- Well, there's no sense taking chances.
When a boy feels like a prisoner, he'll do anything to get out.
Incidentally, I'd keep him out of the kitchen.
Very dangerous room, the kitchen.
Well, Marshall doesn't spend much time there anyway.
There's so few things he can eat, it hardly seems worthwhile.
- Mrs. Stephens.
- Oh, and the bathroom.
Worst room in the whole house.
Wouldn't have one in our home.
- Too dangerous.
- Even worse than baseball.
I've heard all I'm going to listen to, thank you.
Marshall!
Mrs. Burns, please, don't get angry.
What we were trying to say is you can't protect anyone from everything.
Mr. Stephens, and I'll ask you for the last time stay away from my little boy, you hear me?
You stay away from him or I'll report you both to the authorities.
Come on, Marshall, we're going home.
- Darrin.
- Forget it, honey, just forget it.
Will nothing in this world stop your interference?
Will nothing?
Just a minute, calm down, Mrs. Burns.
What's the trouble?
Don't tell me he isn't here.
Don't.
If you're talking about Marshall, no.
- Where else would he be?
- He's run away again?
And this time he didn't even take his clothes with him.
The game.
The Wildcats are playing their season's opener today.
Of course.
Mrs. Burns, he's perfectly all right.
He's gone to play in the big game.
- Do you think so?
- I'm certain of it.
Then there's still time to stop him.
He just left a short while ago.
You don't mean you're really gonna stop him from playing?
If other mothers realised how seriously a child could be hurt out there they wouldn't permit it either.
- But lots of mothers I don't wanna hear any more.
Samantha, Mrs. Burns is right.
This is our fault.
I think we should help her.
- Mr. Stephens, I don't trust you.
- You wanna get to the park, don't you?
- Yes.
- Well, we'll take you.
- You don't drive, do you?
- Well, of course not.
I didn't think so.
Come on, Sam, there's no time to lose.
Now, you won't drive too fast, will you?
No faster than the law allows, There certainly isn't much traffic, is there?
Certainly isn't.
But we sure are making good time.
Seems to me that light has been red for about 15 minutes.
- You suppose it's broken?
- Oh, I don't think so.
It should change any minute now.
- There it is.
- Good.
Strike three!
You're out of there, son.
Okay, Kravitz, get in there and swing away.
Okay, coach.
Play ball!
- Abner, Floyd is up to bat again.
- Wonderful.
Well, the least you could do is look at him.
Why do I have to look at him?
Don't I give him money?
Belt it, Floyd!
Ball.
Marshall!
Marshall, you come here!
Strike one.
Haven't you anything to say to me?
I pitched three innings and I only gave up one hit.
- You're kidding.
- And I got a single and drove in one run.
- Ball two.
I'm very proud of you, Marshall.
But you shouldn't have left without telling your mother.
She was very worried about you.
Now, that's not right.
I'm sorry, Ma.
But we can go home now if you want.
All right, Kravitz!
He's safe!
Abner, look what happened.
The tying run is on base.
Your nephew, Floyd, hit a double.
Don't yell, Gladys.
Does everybody have to know our business?
Come on, you're up.
Get in there and tear the cover off of it.
- I can't, coach.
- You can't?
What do you mean you can't?
- What does he mean, he can't?
- You better ask his mother.
- What does he mean he can't?
- I'm Marshall's mother.
What does he mean he can't?
What's the matter with him, Mrs. Burns?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
Go on, Marshall.
Belt it, Marsh!
- We want a hit!
- Yeah, we want a hit!
They used to call him Marshmallow.
- Down in front!
- Yeah!
Down in front!
There they are.
The Stephens from across the street.
I swear there's something funny about her.
She came here yesterday with Marshmallow Burns.
Oh, he was miserable.
And before that he couldn't do anything.
But then she came along, he improved 100 percent.
Now, what do you think about that, Abner?
I think it's entirely possible the same thing would happen to me.
Strike one!
- We want a hit!
- Come on!
- Not so much as a twitch, understand?
- No, no, of course not.
He did very well before we got here, didn't he?
Let's keep it that way.
Come on!
Come on!
Strike two!
- Come on, Marsh!
- Belt it!
- Come on!
- Hit a home run!
Belt it, Marshall.
All right, play ball.
Sam, don't do it.
Let him be on his own and let the chips fall where they may.
Get me home, Marsh.
Get me home!
Come on!
Attaboy!
Come on, boy!
Come on!
He'll never make it.
He just can't.
I know he can't.
- Sam, don't you dare.
- Oh, Darrin!
Safe!
- Did he make it?
- I was watching you.
Great play on the ball, Clark.
You're all great!
- Marshall, your nose is bleeding.
- I know, Ma.
Ain't it great?
That boy of yours has got a lot of spunk.
What does he mean he can't?
He's got the makings of a fine ball player.
- Oh, really?
- Well, yes.
If his father would work with him a little.
Oh, I'm a widow, Mr. Gribben.
Oh, yeah?
Well, maybe I ought to drop over and work with him a little.
You know what I mean.
Well, that will be just fine if Well, if you think it would be worthwhile.
Wasn't it an exciting day?
Aren't you glad you went?
- I mean, for Marshall's sake.
- Yes, I am.
I'm very proud of him.
And he did it all by himself, you saw that.
Yes, but you almost slipped.
I was crazy about the way you stopped me.
Thank you very much.
The pleasure was all mine.
Now, how about some dinner?
Anything you want.
You just name it.
Chateaubriand, coq au vin bouillabaisse.
I'm going to twitch us up a banquet tonight.
Sam, you promised.
Well, all right.
Stop me again and I'll scramble us up a couple of eggs.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
My those cookies smell scrumptious, Samantha.
- Thank you, Bertha.
- You must give me the recipe.
Bertha won the pie-baking contest at the fair this year.
Didn't you, Bertha?
Well, it was my turn.
Now, who'd like milk with their tea?
You've done enough, dear.
You come right over here and sit down we'll take care of it ourselves.
I'm trying to give it up.
- Shouldn't Aunt Clara be here by now?
- She certainly should.
You know, I worry about that woman every time she steps out of the house.
She's getting on, you know and she's Well, let's be frank.
She's gone a little funny.
And stubborn.
I offered to pick her up, but no, she insisted on flying by herself.
Have either of you flown with Clara lately?
- Not lately.
- Suicide, plain suicide.
There's someone at your front door, dear.
I didn't hear anything.
Excuse me.
Endora told me that since the marriage she doesn't even do little things anymore.
Oh, my stars.
Aunt Clara, what happened?
Oh, I got the spell all wrong.
I got all mixed in the spell and I got landed in the middle of the freeway.
Good gracious.
Well, here, we'll just get you straightened out.
Come on in.
Now, don't you look lovely.
Yes, dust you off a little bit.
Now, come on.
- Hello, Clara.
- Hello, Bertha dear.
You sit down, Aunt Clara, I'll pour you a nice cup of tea.
Oh no, no, no.
I can do that myself.
Well, I'm not as old as all that, you know.
Well, let me see.
Now, let me see.
I know, dear.
I know.
I know.
Clara, in the future, will you please ask?
Well, I didn't want any tea anyway.
And my powers are just as good as ever, so don't get pernickety with me.
It's just that at this time of year, l It sends me all flooey.
I hate Halloween.
I hate Halloween.
Well?
- They're very good.
- Yeah.
They're the best Halloween candies our company's ever put on the market.
- Try some more.
- I haven't finished with what I have.
Go on, go on.
Now, what we wanted was a special campaign devised to run through the entire Halloween season, right?
Nice and chewy, aren't they?
Now, of course, the first thing we needed was a highly identifiable trademark, right?
I'm sure I can come up with something for you, Mr. Brinkman.
You don't have to come up with a thing.
I know exactly what I want.
I puzzled over it for days, let me tell you, and then suddenly the answer came to me just like that.
Are you ready?
A witch.
A witch.
Well, that certainly ties in with the product.
It's not the broomsticks I mind so much, it's the way they make us look those ugly, horrid warts and those long, crooked noses.
I guess they just don't realize that we're like anybody else, almost.
Up to now, we've been able to do nothing, but I can't take another year.
That's why we came to see you.
We thought you might have some ideas.
We tried Endora, but she's not interested in the cause at all.
Oh, I know.
Mother flies to France every year this time till it all blows over.
She thinks we should try and forget it.
I can't forget it.
Every time I see a picture of one of those ugly old crones I fly right home and cry myself to sleep.
An ugly old crone, with a long nose, I mean long.
And then warts on her chin and broken teeth, a lot of broke A whole mouthful of broken teeth and a tall black hat and a broomstick.
Can I see some rough sketches tomorrow?
Well, I'll get to work on that right away.
I don't know why we don't simply tell everyone that we're witches and then they'd see what wonderful, nice people we really are.
You'd better take out lots of fire insurance first.
Bertha, they stopped burning us years ago.
We have made some progress.
Well, not enough.
I personally think it all begins with the children.
Someone ought to rewrite those fairy tales.
Well, you know, show Hansel and Gretel for what they really are a couple of pushy kids going around eating sweet old ladies' houses.
I think that's the silliest thing I ever heard of.
You got any better ideas?
Wait a minute, Darrin might have an idea.
A mortal?
Oh, I don't think so, Samantha.
Mortals don't seem to know how to do anything too well.
Darrin's a very good advertising man, and he's familiar with our problem.
But do you think he's interested enough to do anything about it?
I'm sure he'd be glad to help us.
I think that's a crackerjack notion, right up with the times.
I'll talk to him as soon he gets home.
He'll probably have some wonderful ideas.
Darrin's home.
It may be better if I spoke to him alone.
Well, we've stayed much too long anyway, dear.
Do you think he'll be able to help us?
- I'm sure of it.
- Do keep in touch, and let us know.
- Oh, I will.
- Thanks for the tea, dear.
We'll just slip out this way.
- We had a lovely time.
- Goodbye.
I'd better be running along too, you know.
- Certainly.
- Anything you need, let me know.
Oh, yes.
- Well, goodbye.
- Oh, goodbye.
Goodbye.
Aunt Clara, are you all right?
I'm fine, fine.
What went wrong?
Maybe you didn't concentrate.
Oh, yes.
Could be, you know.
Aunt Clara, here, I have a marvellous idea.
Why don't you go out the back through the kitchen door.
Maybe that will be the best way.
These walls are getting harder and harder.
Aunt Clara.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Expecting rain?
Oh, no, no, just straightening up.
How was your day?
Grim.
There's something important I'd like your advice about.
Sure, as soon as I put some finishing touches on these sketches.
You have bicarbonate handy?
- Something you eat disagree with you?
- You could say that.
Sure, I'll get you one.
Here you are, darling.
- Thank you, sweetheart.
- You look tired.
I'm almost finished.
What did you want to talk about?
Well, Darrin, I need some professional advice.
I was thinking this afternoon that just about this time of year, somebody should What's that?
- A Halloween witch for a billboard.
- You're going to use that picture?
It's not quite finished yet.
I thought I'd put another wart here.
Darrin, how could you?
You of all people, you should know better.
That's the kind of thing we're trying to fight.
- What are you talking about?
- That picture, it's offensive.
- Offensive?
- Is that how you think I look?
- Will you calm down?
- Do you?
- Of course not.
- Then why did you do it?
Because that's the way most people think witches look.
Is that any reason to discriminate against a minority group?
- What minority group?
- Witches, of course.
- Sam, people don't believe in witches.
- What's that got to do with anything?
How can you discriminate against something you don't know exists?
Don't split hairs.
Sweetheart, if you realized how ridiculous you - Where are you going?
- I'm going to hang by my feet from a beam in the attic and cackle at the moon.
What's the matter with you?
Are you serious?
Of course I am.
How would you like it if you were always represented as something different?
Well, let's face it, darling, you are a little different.
- Darrin, please.
- What did I say?
- You're prejudiced.
- Prejudiced?
Mother was right.
If I was prejudiced, I wouldn't have married you, would I?
Oh, so that's it.
You think you did me a big favour.
Took the poor little witch in.
Quite a sacrifice.
Makes you feel self-righteous.
Is that it?
- I may get very sick.
- Anyone as bigoted as you deserves it.
I am not bigoted!
Witches have feelings, just the same as anyone else.
When we see those little children around on Halloween with blacked-out teeth and warts Don't you understand?
It hurts.
Does it really mean that much to you, Sam?
Of course it does.
I remember when I was a child, Mother and I used to leave the country so we wouldn't have to look at those ugly masks.
It was horrible.
I knew you'd understand.
I understand perfectly, darling.
I just hope Brinkman does.
I'm telling you, that's not what I want.
I want an old crone with blacked-out teeth.
And she's got warts on, on Mr. Brinkman, listen to me.
Listen for just a minute.
Now, everyone uses the traditional Halloween witch.
Who's to say they really look like that?
Now, my idea is to get away from the old stereotype and use a beautiful well-dressed witch as your trademark.
You are nuts.
Witches got long noses and blacked-out teeth Stop.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Look here, fella, I don't like being insulted.
Neither do witches.
They've got feelings too.
You're afraid of offending a witch?
Well, if I were a witch, I'd be offended.
Wouldn't you, Mr. Brinkman?
I mean if you said that I look like that, I'd Mr. Brinkman, supposing there really were witches and there's no absolute proof there aren't can you imagine how they would feel to have their image distorted?
Tate, come in here, please.
What's the trouble?
Say to him what you just said to me.
I was just trying to convince him to use a beautiful woman in the campaign.
No, no, no.
The other thing, the other thing.
Well, I was just putting forth a theory that witches might exist.
Witches?
You hear that?
You mean with long noses, blacked-out teeth and warts?
No, of course not, they probably look more like Glinda.
- Who?
- Who?
Glinda.
The Good Witch of the North in The Wizard of Oz.
Oh, she's gorgeous.
The Good Witch of the North?
He doesn't wanna hurt her feelings.
I'm merely suggesting a more sophisticated campaign.
Something with a bit more imagination.
Darrin, you do understand exactly what Mr. Brinkman wants, don't you?
He should.
I told him a thousand times.
It's a simple breakdown of communication.
You'll have your sketches, Mr. Brinkman.
How about it, Darrin?
Put someone else on the account, Larry.
What?
Darrin, I see no reason why there should be a problem.
It seems to me to be a fairly simple campaign.
Very simple from Mr. Brinkman's point of view.
What's wrong with the way I see it?
Nothing at all from your point of view.
I just think it should have a little more sophistication and imagination.
Darrin, you're being unnecessarily wilful and stubborn.
- I'm being honest.
- Who made you an authority on witches?
Nobody.
But Well What's so great about warts?
- Hi, honey, did they call?
- No, they didn't call.
Maybe you should call Mr. Brinkman and apologize.
- You know I can't do that.
- Not even for me?
- For you?
- Darling, I can't go on like this.
I've been feeling guilty ever since you walked out on Larry Tate yesterday.
Why should you feel guilty?
Because if you weren't married to me, you wouldn't have lost your job.
Subconsciously, all our lives you'll hold it against me.
I told you this has nothing to do with you, Samantha.
You get out of here and let me do these bills, huh?
Darrin?
- I have an idea.
- What?
Mr. Brinkman wouldn't care what campaign he had as long as he sold his candies, right?
Suppose somehow all the other candy companies went out of business, and l Will you stop that?
You got me in enough trouble as it is.
You see, you do hold it against me.
Samantha Aunt Clara, Mary Bertha, I have to talk to you.
We're here, Samantha.
Are you all right, Clara?
Yes, yes, of course I am.
Let me go, I can stand by myself.
I'm sorry to get you up at this hour, but it's very important.
We know, dear.
We feel terrible about what's happened.
It's all our fault that your young man has lost his job.
- Now, what can we do to help?
- Now, you must understand Darrin is very proud.
Unless he's asked to go back, he won't go back.
- It's a matter of principle and integrity.
- Two excellent reasons.
Bertha could make a telephone call.
She's wonderful at voice imitations.
No, what I was thinking of was a way to make Mr. Brinkman change his mind about the campaign.
That way we'll be helping Darrin and ourselves at the same time.
Wonderful.
Now, what's the idea?
We could start with a protest march.
- That's very good.
- And nonviolent.
We could add signs.
Signs?
Oh, that's an excellent idea.
How about?
Very much to the point.
Now, let's see, how about this one?
- Wonderful.
- I know one too.
I think that's exactly how we feel, and if this doesn't have any effect I have a few more ideas we can discuss on the way to Mr. Brinkman's.
Good.
Coming, Clara?
Clara!
Oh, I was just mentally counting my doorknobs.
You'll need a sign.
A sign?
Oh, a sign.
No?
It's the best I could do.
Shall we go?
What are you doing up there?
Just read the signs, Mr. Brinkman.
"Vote for Coolidge"?
These signs, Mr. Brinkman.
We're a protest group.
We checked the advertising campaign that you planned, depicting us as old crones.
We find it distasteful and insulting.
I don't care what you find it.
What business is it of yours anyway?
Why, it's very much our business, Mr. Brinkman.
We're witches.
- Oh, you're witches, are you?
- We certainly are.
You come on down here off my lamp.
The rest of you come on down here too.
- You hear me?
- Don't you believe us, Mr. Brinkman?
I'll tell you what I believe.
I believe you'd all better get out of here before you're thrown out.
- He doesn't believe us.
Well, I guess we'll just have to convince him.
All ready?
Together.
Clara, what are you doing?
Oh, I was just looking at this doorknob.
How do you get it so brilliant?
Stick to business, Clara.
Now, come up here and sit down.
You keep your shirt on.
All right, I've had enough of this.
Maybe the police will have something to A snake.
Still don't believe in witches, Mr. Brinkman?
It's that rich food.
It's all that rich food I ate.
I should never eat French cooking.
My stomach just won't take it.
Criticizing French cooking.
- Cigarette?
- What?
- Blindfold?
- Why?
Why would I need a blindfold?
L Ready!
- Please, don't shoot me.
Don't - Aim!
I do believe in witches, I do, I do.
I do believe in witches.
Fire!
They shot me.
I'm dead.
I told you I believed you, but you killed me anyway.
It's not fair.
Oh, nothing of the sort.
You're perfectly all right.
- I'm all right.
- Practically.
- What do you mean "practically"?
- Take a look in the mirror.
- What did you do to me?
- The same thing you did to us.
I never did anything to you.
Old crones, you said.
With long hooked noses and blacked-out teeth and warts.
How'd you like to go through life looking like that?
You wouldn't leave me like this.
Of course not, we want the world to know you as you really are.
Now, you'll do the same for us, won't you, Mr. Brinkman?
I promise.
I promise.
Good, you can look again.
Oh, boy.
That's what I call a nightmare.
I need a drink.
I'm glad you finally saw my point of view, Mr. Brinkman.
I know you won't be sorry.
Mr. Brinkman?
Oh, sure.
Sure, that's Sure.
Would you like me to go over the details of the campaign, Mr. Brinkman?
- The details?
- Oh, no.
No, you do everything.
L - I have to go to the police station.
- What for?
I was robbed.
I'm sorry to hear that, Mr. Brinkman.
Well, it's all right.
All they took were doorknobs.
A hundred and five of them.
Every doorknob in the house.
Morning.
- Hello, Samantha.
Nice to see you again.
- Hello, Larry.
No, couldn't be.
Oh, I'll admit I was sceptical right up until the time Brinkman confirmed our research reports.
Mothers and children don't buy Halloween candy, fathers do.
That gorgeous witch on the billboard has kicked Brinkman's sales up 27 percent.
Darrin, your instinct was absolutely right.
Thank you.
Of course it was.
He's the best advertising man in the business.
Thank you both for them kind words.
Come on, Darrin, tell me, where'd you get the idea for that campaign?
- Well - It was intuition, and that's something you can't buy.
You have it or you haven't, wouldn't you say?
I sure would.
And I'd like to propose a toast.
To Darrin's intuition wherever it comes from, may he never lose it.
- I'll drink to that.
- Me too.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Hi, Darrin.
Hi, Larry.
AII set for your trip?
I Ieave tonight.
I'II be in London tomorrow morning, Paris tomorrow night.
I'm afraid it's one of the disadvantages of having a top designer for a cIient.
I'd Iike to get out of it, but it's good business to Iook at his spring coIIection.
Yeah, it's tough having to go to duII pIaces Iike London and Paris.
No, this is no pIeasure trip.
EspeciaIIy this year.
My wife insists on coming with me.
If you're that much against the trip, why don't you send me instead.
Darrin, you're my best friend.
I wouIdn't send my worst enemy on a trip with Louise.
So I know you won't mind.
I had a feeIing you were Ieading up to something.
I do have a few Ioose ends that need Iooking after and I wondered if you couId take care of them whiIe I'm gone.
If you're going to be sIaving away in Paris, it's the Ieast I can do.
Now, Susan.
WeII, au rev oir and toi, je t'aime, I think.
HeIIo.
Honey, I'm afraid I won't be able to tak e you to dinner tonight.
Larry just dumped a Ioad of urgent work on my desk.
Oh, weII that's aII right, darIing.
Maybe tomorrow?
Better not make any pIans, Sam.
I'm afraid you're going to have to amuse yourseIf the next few days.
Bye, darIing.
Red queen on the bIack king.
Thank you.
Mother.
GIad to see you.
What's wrong?
Can't I be gIad to see my own mother without something being wrong?
Oh, reaIIy?
Bored, eh?
I knew it was going to happen sooner or Iater.
It's not that.
Darrin's been working very hard IateIy.
I've been sort of IoneIy.
I've hardIy seen him the Iast few days.
The situation is obvious, Samantha.
Busy husband, negIected wife vegetating in front of the teIe set, finito!
That's what I Iike about your visits.
You aIways bring a ray of sunshine into my drab existence.
WeII, that's what mothers are for, dear.
You just say the word, and I'II take you away from aII of this.
Good idea.
-ReaIIy?
-But onIy for Iunch.
WeII, at Ieast that's a start.
Where wouId you Iike to go?
We can go to the Cozy-Have-a-Snack.
It's nothing fancy, but it's not far.
The Cozy-Have-a-Snack?
Oh, darIing, you've got to be kidding.
We can go to a restaurant in town if you Iike.
I have a better idea.
I know of a marveIIous IittIe bistro that serves the most divine cheese souffIé.
Sounds wonderfuI.
Where is it?
On the Ieft bank.
Left bank of what?
Of Paris.
Where did you think, the Ieft bank of FIushing?
-Paris.
We can't go there.
-Why not?
Mother, you know very weII Darrin doesn't Iike me to do those things.
Oh, weII, it's a pity.
Paris is so IoveIy this time of the year.
-Remember?
-Yes, I remember.
The trees are budding in the Champs-ÉIysées.
The sidewaIk cafés are crowded with peopIe.
And the chiIdren are pIaying in the Bois de BouIogne.
No, Mother.
You'II be back before he gets home for dinner.
He's not coming home for dinner.
Then reaIIy, Samantha, you are being ridicuIous.
I'm trying to be a good wife.
Aren't good wives aIIowed to have Iunch with their mothers?
Of course.
Then what difference does it make where they have it?
It's not that at aII.
WeII, I suppose you mean now that you're married what was once between us is no more.
AII right, Mother.
We wiII go.
-WonderfuI.
-But we can't be too Iong.
-Is that understood?
-Understood.
Last one to the BouIevard Saint Germain is a rotten egg.
That's my gaI.
-Isn't quite the same.
-No, he had to.
WeII, I think it's been a divine Iunch, hasn't it?
Just marveIIous.
But I remember the saIade niçoise as being better the Iast time we were here.
When were we here Iast, anyway?
Two or three years ago, I think.
That summer you and I spend a coupIe of weeks on the ItaIian Riviera.
La Spezia, I beIieve.
Yes, I remember.
No, it wasn't La Spezia.
It was Portofino.
Oh, yes.
The count from Genoa.
Lord Fredo, of course.
FoIIowed you aII over ItaIy.
'' FIy with me to the moon, Endora,'' he used to say.
FinaIIy one night I agreed.
Poor chap had a nervous breakdown, we were onIy haIfway there.
We have had good times, haven't we?
Yes, we have.
Don't you sometimes miss aII this, Samantha?
Not reaIIy.
I have other things that make up for it.
Like a snappy game of soIitaire topped off by a gourmet Iunch at the Cozy-Have-a-Snack?
Now, Iet's not go into that again.
By aII means, Iet's not.
Come on, on to the fashion show.
No fashion shows.
I Ieft a whoIe piIe of Iaundry on the ironing board.
Oh, now, Samantha, no woman, witch nor mortaI, ever visits Paris or Ieaves without buying a dress.
It wouId be a betrayaI of a whoIe sex.
Let's go.
Larry, can you imagine how sensationaI I'd Iook in that dress?
WeII, the packaging can onIy do so much for a product, dear.
Oh, you.
AIways thinking of business.
Mother, isn't that beautifuI?
Oh, yes.
You'd Iook marveIIous in a dress Iike that, Samantha.
If I waIked in in a dress Iike that Darrin's eyebaIIs wouId faII right out of his head.
I doubt if he'd know a Dior from a gunnysack.
That's not very nice.
Come on, Iet's find a seat.
-Mother.
-What?
-Let's get out of here.
-Why?
Never mind.
I'II expIain Iater.
Come on.
Samantha?
Samantha?
-Hi.
-It is you!
I thought it was you, but I couIdn't be sure.
What a surprise.
Wait tiII Louise sees you.
Come on over.
Louise, Iook who's here.
Samantha?
Samantha Stephens, what on Earth are you doing in Paris?
HeIIo, Louise.
Oh, I just fIew in.
WiII you Iook at her face?
AbsoIuteIy stunned!
Quite a surprise seeing us, eh?
Oh, yes.
You are the Iast peopIe I wanted-- Expected to see.
I don't beIieve we've met your charming companion.
Who?
Oh, this is my mother.
This is Larry Tate and Louise Tate.
-How do you do?
-Mr. Tate is Darrin's empIoyer.
Oh, reaIIy?
Isn't that amusing?
That we shouId bump into each other.
Darrin didn't say anything about you coming to Paris.
WeII, he has been working a Iot IateIy, and I've been more or Iess aIone.
So, of course, when Mother-- I convinced Samantha to make the trip with me.
Yes, it aII happened very suddenIy.
Just Iike that.
WeII, we're going to have to ceIebrate.
-CeIebrate?
-Sure, make a night of it.
A night of it?
No.
I mean, I don't think I can.
Oh, now, Samantha, no excuses.
That's right.
Darrin wouId never forgive us if we didn't take care of you here.
Where can we pick you up?
WeII, I think it might be easier if we met at your pIace.
AII right.
The PIaza Athénée.
How wouId Iike to pop in about 8:30?
I'd Iove it.
WeII, I think it's absoIuteIy wonderfuI of you to get Darrin to Iet you come to Paris without him.
Samantha.
Oh, yes, it was.
What did you do to get him to agree?
WeII, we reaIIy didn't taIk about it that much.
Did you hear that, Larry?
It took me eight years to get you to bring me to Paris but they didn't even taIk about it that much.
WeII, neither did we.
I can remember weeks when we didn't taIk at aII.
WouId you excuse me for a moment?
-Of course.
-WouId you Iike company?
Oh, no.
I mean that's very sweet of you, but your dinner might get coId and, weII, I'II be back in a second.
Samantha doesn't seem quite herseIf tonight, does she?
For goodness sakes, Larry, she's stiII a bride, and this is her first separation.
Isn't that right, Endora?
WeII, I imagine she's very Ionesome for DonaId.
Who?
-I beg your pardon?
-You mean Darrin.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
I've got a great idea.
Let's phone Darrin and teII him what's happened.
MarveIIous.
Isn't that a wonderfuI idea, Endora?
No, I wouIdn't do that.
-Why not?
-Change of time, the hour, you know.
WeII, it's earIy back there.
Garçon.
I'II get a teIephone right here on the tabIe.
It'II put Darrin's mind at ease when he knows we're taking care of you two.
Won't he be surprised?
Oh, he'II be surprised aII right.
Darrin, I was wondering how Iate you're gonna have to work tonight.
Pretty Iate, I'm afraid, honey.
Bear with me another day.
I shouId have work cIeaned up by then.
I understand, dear.
Thank you, darIing.
What've you been up to today?
Me?
WeII, nothing much.
I've been Iooking at a few dresses.
You sound funny.
Is something wrong?
Wrong?
No, no, of course not.
I just.
I miss you, darIing.
To heck with work, I'm going to come on home.
No, no, no.
Now, don't do that.
It's important that you finish your work.
I'II see you Iater.
Goodbye.
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo, who is this?
This is Samantha.
Samantha?
Yes, who is this?
Is this 555-73 28?
Yes, it is.
A Mr. Larry Tate is caIIing you from Paris, France.
Operator, did you get me the right number?
What's the matter?
I couId have sworn it was Samantha.
HardIy seems possibIe.
I know, but when I asked her who it was, she said, ''Samantha.
'' At Ieast I thought she said Samantha.
Oh, they just gave you the wrong number.
I'm sorry, monsieur.
Your number did not answer at all.
Thank you, operator.
Oh, hoId on a moment, wiII you?
You know, considering the difference in time and aII the work I Ieft him Darrin's probabIy at the office.
I'II caII there.
HeIIo, operator, wouId you pIease try to get me 555-6059?
That's it, operator, thank you.
Larry just thought he spoke to you on the phone.
Me?
We have a surprise for you, haven't we?
Oh, yes, a beauty.
HeIIo, Darrin?
Hey, boy.
This is Larry Tate caIIing from Paris.
Oh, Larry, how are you?
Fine.
Have I got a surprise for you.
You'II never guess who's sitting next to me, right here in Paris.
Samantha.
Go on.
TaIk to your husband.
He's aII yours.
Go on, Samantha.
Darrin is on the other end.
Darrin?
Oh, hi, darIing.
It's Samantha.
Sam, how did you--?
-When did--?
-Oh, yes, I'm having a wonderfuI time.
Sam, when--?
How--?
WeII, I just can't wait to get home and teII you aII about my trip.
Trip?
!
Trip to where--?
Where are you right--?
I Iove you too, sweetheart.
Bye.
WeII, was he surprised?
Oh, yes, he was surprised.
I bet that just about made his day.
Just about.
Yes.
I'm sorry, darIing.
I got home as soon as I couId.
That's aII right.
That's aII right.
I needed time to work things out.
You Iook IoveIy.
WeII, it's just a IittIe something.
WeII, you see, we had dinner with the Tates.
You're not angry with me.
Angry?
How can I be angry?
I don't understand.
I added things up.
Then I stood back, took a Iook at the totaI.
Saving 3 cents a can on wax beans is, weII.
What kind of thriII is that for someone Iike you?
Darrin, have you been drinking?
Your mother is right.
You have been drinking.
Just enough for me to see things in their proper perspective.
You can't expect to snatch an eagIe out of a sky, tie it to the ground cIip its wings and expect it to waIk around with a smiIe on its beak.
PIease Iet me expIain.
There is no need to expIain.
I understand perfectIy.
I'm sorry about what happened today.
No one can bIame you for that.
This is a poor swap for Europe, gIamour and gaiety.
AII I want is the normaI Iife of a normaI housewife.
That's why you went to Paris.
I onIy went there for Iunch.
Oh, I see.
WeII, that's normaI.
I onIy did it because, weII, you've been working so much IateIy and-- It's my fauIt, Sam.
There's no need for you to apoIogise.
I shouId've known you can't take a beautifuI witch in the prime of Iife and expect her to hang up her twitch.
It's against nature.
Darrin, what are you trying to say?
I'm saying it's time for compIete honesty.
I'm not going to stand in the way of your freedom.
That's obviousIy what you want.
That's not true.
And stop trying to spare my feeIings.
If there is anything I can't stand, it's anyone feeIing sorry for me.
EspeciaIIy when you're doing such a good job of it yourseIf.
Where are you going?
Back to la dolce vita, and I hope you're satisfied.
Samantha.
Darrin.
Hi, Larry.
You just get in?
Few minutes ago.
How are you?
-Okay.
How is Louise?
-Fine.
She's stiII in Paris.
-You came back aIone?
-Louise insisted.
I fought it for a whiIe to make it Iook good.
She said it was marveIIous how understanding you were about Samantha.
The Ieast I couId do is Iet her stay on a few extra days.
I see.
So they're having a baII.
-They?
-Louise, Samantha and Endora.
Samantha is with Louise?
Sure.
Didn't you know?
Oh, sure.
I mean, weII, she didn't say.
-Haven't you taIked to her?
-Of course, but it's been a coupIe days.
Then Louise was right.
You two did have a beef.
No, of course not.
It was nothing Iike that.
-I guess that expIains it.
-ExpIains what?
Louise said she had never seen a girI working so hard at having a good time.
-Is Samantha reaIIy unhappy?
-Yes.
Matter of fact, now that I think of it, I'd say she's downright miserabIe.
You're not just saying that to make me feeI better?
Not at aII.
It's never occurred to me how cIose Paris is since the innovation of a jet.
You mean you're going now?
Why not?
I finished up aII the work.
I'm entitIed to a bonus.
-Besides, I miss my wife.
-Yes, but that has no bearing-- You rather I caII Samantha and insist she come home?
She and Louise couId be here in a matter of hours.
That's bIackmaiI.
Yes, it is, isn't it?
See you Monday, Larry.
Thanks.
The fashions this year were generaIIy exciting.
ParticuIarIy the design presented by-- -HeIIo, Larry.
-HeIIo, Samantha.
Excuse me for a moment whiIe I-- Samantha, what're you doing here?
I took the fIight right after yours.
-I had to come back.
-Is Louise with you?
-No.
She doesn't know I've Ieft yet.
-Good.
That is, there's no sense in Louise having to cut her hoIiday short because you two Iovebirds are having probIems.
Where is Darrin?
He wasn't in his office.
Oh, weII, he's probabIy-- Darrin?
For heaven's sake, he's on his way to Paris to find you.
-ReaIIy?
-Yes, he Ieft about an hour ago.
Thank you, Larry.
I'II see you Iater.
He's not on this one either.
WeII, you'II have to check severaI dozen fIights, Samantha.
Why don't you go to Paris and wait for him.
Now this may sound siIIy to you, but I miss him so much.
I'II check that one down there.
Now, if he's not onboard that, we'II just go on to Paris.
Samantha!
-Mr. Stephens.
-My wife's out there.
What?
I mean, I was thinking about my wife, and I thought I saw her out there.
She's in Paris, and I'm on my way to meet her.
Oh, yes, of course.
I understand.
I'm sorry.
I was asIeep.
I was probabIy dreaming.
Quite aII right.
WouId you care for your dinner now?
Yes, thank you.
CertainIy.
Samantha.
HeIIo, sweetheart.
You scared me to death.
Oh, I'm sorry.
But I just couIdn't wait to see you.
I'm sorry about the other night.
PIease try to understand how I feeI.
I do understand, and you don't have to expIain anymore.
I just want you to know how Iucky I think I am.
Thank you, darIing.
Are you sure you wouIdn't Iike to just go back home?
From here?
We can, you know.
Nothing doing.
My nervous system has suffered enough trauma for one day thank you.
WeII, aII right.
Anyway, it'II be fun seeing Paris for the first time.
What do you mean?
You've been there before.
Never with you.
And being in Paris with someone you Iove is Iike being in Paris for the first time.
When we arrive, I wouIdn't be at aII surprised if Louise caIIs Larry and asks him to come back right away.
-Do you think so?
-I know it.
Larry wiII never forgive me.
It's the onIy way to fIy.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Enough is enough.
It's about time I paid some attention to you.
Oh, don't worry about me.
I'm practicing my button-sewing.
Getting pretty good too, see?
It's marvellous, but the workaday world is over.
Friday night.
- Time for excitement and romance.
- Oh, marvellous.
Where are we going?
We're not going anywhere.
Excitement, romance.
That goes with black tie, champagne and dancing.
- We don't have to get that excited.
- Oh, I see.
No champagne or dancing?
- You can wear my black tie if you like.
- Oh, thank you, darling.
I love you with all my heart.
But nothing is going to get me to put my shoes back on, let alone a black tie.
Oh, I just thought we'd sit around here together just the two of us, you know.
Oh, grab that, will you, honey?
Oh, sure.
Hello.
Yes, it is.
Yes, he is.
Just a minute please.
Darrin, it's for you.
Thank you, honey.
Hello.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Well, you are an eager beaver, aren't you.
Oh, tonight would be fine.
Well, I'm looking forward to meeting you too.
Yes, goodbye.
- Who was that?
- An admirer.
- An admirer of what?
- Of me.
I'm to be interviewed as the prototype for the successful young advertising executive.
Really, Darrin?
For newspapers and magazines, television something like that?
- Something like that.
- Which one?
- A paper.
- Which one?
- A local paper.
- Which one?
- Local school paper.
Oh, which one?
A local junior college paper by a local junior college journalism student.
- Well, I think that's very nice.
- Well it's a start anyway.
- No telling where I'll go from there.
- Well, I'm very proud of you.
- Was that his mother who called?
- No, that was her.
- Her?
- Sorry, she.
Oh, well, how did her?
She pick on you?
Saw my picture in the neighbourhood paper when we moved in.
Oh, yes, that was a wonderful picture.
You looked sort of fearless and sexy as I recall.
Somehow that photographer caught me, didn't he?
- Where are you going?
- To put a tie on.
- It doesn't look nice like this.
- Oh, I see.
Sam, will you fix some cold drinks, sandwiches, things like that?
Why don't you just give me a quarter and I'll go to the movies?
I can't tell you how much I appreciate you letting me come over tonight.
You're the most important term project I've got.
- Well, I'm flattered.
- It's really fascinating how much you look like your picture.
- Oh, yes.
Somehow that photographer caught Yes, thank you.
- Can we offer you something?
- Please don't go to any bother.
Oh, it's no bother.
It's no bother.
I have sandwiches all ready.
You're very sweet, and I'll try not to keep your husband for too long.
Oh, well, I appreciate that.
You know, I think creative advertising is among the more fascinating avocations in the world today.
Yes, I suppose it is.
I never expected that anyone who was so successful in that field would be well, as young as you, Mr. Stephens.
Well, I'm not that young, Ms. Randall, although most men in my position are a bit older, I guess.
Baloney.
And there's corned beef and liverwurst and some of that wonderful smelly cheese too.
My husband's simply crazy about that.
No, thank you, but I would like a little something to cool me off.
Yes, of course.
One thing I'm dying to know is where you got that idea for that wonderful Caldwell's Soup campaign.
"The only thing that will ever come between us".
It's an inspired slogan.
Well, how did you know that was mine?
I've made quite a study of you, Mr. Stephens.
Well, I am flattered, Ms. Randall.
Please call me Liza.
- Very well, Liza.
- And I'll call you Darrin.
That is if Mrs. Stephens doesn't mind.
Oh, no, of course not.
He's been called worse than that.
My wife has a great sense of humour.
We practically never stop laughing around here.
I suppose you find it difficult to accomplish anything at home.
What do you mean by that?
- She means business, dear.
- Oh, well I guess we'd better just stop laughing so you can get down to some serious work.
You see what I mean?
Actually I do find the office more conducive, yes.
I thought so.
And as long as we have a date to go down there tomorrow I won't have to keep you any longer tonight.
- Tomorrow?
- Well, when Liza Ms. Randall called me about the interview I suggested she come to the office on Saturdays, when it's quiet, so I can show her around.
You see?
Oh, yes, I see.
Liza's never seen a real advertising agency.
Oh, well, I suppose everyone should see one sooner or later.
- Is 9:00 all right?
- That'll be fine.
- In the morning?
- Of course in the morning.
Nice to have met you, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, wonderful to have met you, Liza.
Wonderful to have met you.
Wonderful to have Nice meeting you, Liza.
- See you in the morning, Darrin.
- Yes, good night, Liza.
Nice little girl, isn't she?
- Rather big for a little girl.
- What do you mean?
You certainly bring out the woman in her.
Oh, come on.
All young girls are impressed by an older man.
Well, you certainly are that.
Especially an older man who doesn't look his age.
Vanity, thy name is human.
What's wrong with being human?
At least I'm not a Not a what?
Now, Sam.
Sam, now cut that out.
You're not jealous of a schoolkid, are you?
Not a what?
A teenage, freckle-faced schoolkid in short socks and sneakers when I have something like you.
Like what?
A fascinating, bewitching, beguiling You convinced me.
It's a shame you have to go to the office today.
I won't be long.
Why don't you come with us?
No, thank you.
I've got a lot of housework to do.
- It's almost 9: 15.
Where is our little?
- Sam.
- Typical American schoolkid with freckles, short socks and sneakers?
That is a very accurate description of Liza Randall.
It's also a very accurate description of Huckleberry Finn.
Oh, now you finish your breakfast.
I'll get it.
Good morning.
- Well, good morning.
- Is Darrin?
Is Mr. Stephens ready?
Just about.
Why don't you come in, Liza, and make yourself comfortable.
It'll only be a minute.
I'll tell Mr. Steph Darrin that you're here.
- Who is it?
- Typical American schoolkid with freckles, silk stockings and 3-inch French heels.
- Liza?
- Well, it ain't Huckleberry Finn.
Well, honey, why didn't you ask her to come in?
Come on in, Liza.
- Good morning, Darrin.
- Well, good morning.
- Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
- Thank you.
Don't let me rush you.
I'm ready anytime you are.
- Yes.
Would you care for some coffee?
- No, thank you.
I'll be right with you as soon as I finish my legs.
Eggs.
I'll be waiting.
After all, your wife's been nice enough to lend you to me for a whole day.
- Yes, of course.
Why don't you two get started.
You want to get home before dark.
Are you sure you won't come with us?
Oh, no, I've got loads to do around here.
You two go ahead and have fun.
All right.
Let's go, Liza.
I'll give you my undivided attention, Mr. Stephens so we won't waste a moment.
- See you later.
We won't be late.
Yes, well, be very careful.
- Driving.
- Oh, of course.
- See you later, Mrs. Stephens.
- Yes, Liza.
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes?
My name is Marvin Grogan.
They call me Monster.
- How are you?
- I'm fine, thank you.
And you?
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.
Mrs. Stephens, I believe that was your husband who just left.
- That's right.
- Well, a woman named Liza Randall was seated next to him.
- I know that too.
Very, very next to him.
Now that you mention it, it did catch my eye.
I don't know how disturbed you are but it might interest you to know I'm very disturbed.
I don't think there's really anything to be disturbed about.
You'll pardon me if I disagree with you?
One, Liza Randall is engaged to me.
Two, we have a standing date every Saturday morning, which she broke to go shopping with her mother, which we both know she didn't do.
Three, she's made it very plain that she's out to get your husband.
Well, I really don't think it's that serious.
Four, this is not the first time a situation like this has come up.
You see, Liza has what you call a mother complex, only with fathers.
Five, what Liza Randall wants, Liza Randall gets.
- Unless - Unless what?
Unless you come up with a better suggestion I have decided to break your husband in half.
Why don't you come inside, Monster.
I think you're right.
There's definitely something to be disturbed about.
Once the preliminary sketches are made, and we get together with our copywriters and artists, we see if we can't improve upon them.
And of course we have photographic layout.
Do many women pose for you?
Well, for the photographers, actually.
Your wife is very jealous, isn't she?
No more or less than any woman.
Have you known many women?
Liza, did you come down here to study advertising techniques or to ask me personal questions that are none of your business?
You're a very sensitive man.
Well, you could say that, yes.
Sensitive men are exciting.
They're so So - Sensitive.
- Yes.
Yes.
Now why don't we get into some examples of overall composition.
All right.
Would you like another stack of pancakes, Monster?
No, thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
Eight or nine stacks are all I can go.
I ate all your sausage and bacon too.
I got a lot of hostility, I guess.
Well, I'd rather you attack my icebox than my husband anytime.
- Are you feeling better?
- Pretty good.
Except that when I get emotional, I burn up an awful lot of sugar.
I get a sweet tooth.
- You got any pie?
- Yes, I think so.
- What kind of pie do you prefer?
- I'm very fond of apple.
Well, it seems I recall a fresh-baked apple pie.
But I'm crazy about banana cream.
Oh, well, aren't you lucky?
It isn't apple at all.
But banana cream is pretty rich.
So I stick with apple when I'm in training.
Wonderful.
Which I'm not at the moment.
Half apple and half banana cream?
Stephens' specialty, Monster.
Enjoy yourself and let your conscience be your guide.
Now, as you can see by this analysis curve the public's taste changes with the times.
It isn't enough for an advertising man to have imagination he has to have a sympathetic eye and ear to what the public wants and what they need.
A product's success depends upon its public acceptance which depends on an image created for that product by an advertising executive.
Take clothing styles, for instance.
A different designer dominates the field each year.
Cheers.
Then the public chooses one above all the others.
Now, of course, what we have - What's in that drink?
- Root beer.
- Root beer and what?
- Scotch.
Scotch?
- What's that?
- Gin.
Gin?
Give me that!
Oh, for heaven's sake.
There's a towel over there.
Will you get it for me, please?
You ought to be spanked.
- What's the matter with you?
- Nothing.
I wish you wouldn't talk to me as if I were 12 years old.
You're absolutely right, I do apologize.
A 12-year-old child would have more sense than to pull a foolish stunt like that.
- You do that.
- That's all right, I don't mind.
I would like to be your father for five minutes.
I wouldn't care for that at all.
I like being who I am, and I like you the way you are.
Never mind.
Just put water on the towel and soak the gin out of your dress.
You know how zealously we guard our corporate image, Tate.
The keynote of all our advertising is dignity.
Oh, by all means, dignity.
And let me assure you, Mr. Austen your campaign is going to be designed by one of our most talented and dignified account executives.
- That's good to hear.
- I'm glad we saw his car downstairs.
He often comes into the office on Saturdays.
He's an extremely dedicated young man.
- I'd like to have you meet him.
- Be happy to.
Listen to me, young lady, enough of this nonsense.
- We haven't done a thing.
- We have done all we're going to Oh, look out!
- Hi, Larry.
- I think we are intruding.
Oh, I don't think so.
Mr. Johnson, have you seen Darrin Stephens this morning?
No, I haven't.
But when I do, I'll tell him you were looking for him.
Thank you.
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Johnson.
- All right, let's go.
- Isn't that cute?
He married us.
You have all the material you need for a truly fascinating thesis.
We're leaving by way of the freight elevator.
- Who will break the news to your wife?
- Move.
And so you see, Monster, it's easy to understand why an impressionable girl like Liza would be momentarily smitten by a man like my husband.
Maturity has its own fascination.
I guess so.
If I were you, I'd just forget all about it.
I haven't thought about Liza for half an hour.
- That's a record for me.
- That's wonderful.
Listening to you, it suddenly comes to me what a child she is immature and like that.
- Well, she's still very young, Monster.
Yes, she is, and I realize that now.
And like you say, maturity sure is fascinating.
You're beginning to look hungry again.
I think I'll fix you something to eat.
Mrs. Stephens, I'm not gonna lie to you.
I am getting hungry again.
I want you to know this has been the most fascinating morning of my life.
Well, I'll tell you the truth, Monster.
It's a fascinating morning for me too.
I certainly hope you mean that.
Monster!
Oh, please control yourself.
Please don't do anything rash.
- What's that I smell all over you?
- Gin.
Monster, this is my husband.
Darrin, this is Marvin Grogan.
They call him Monster.
- Gin?
- That's right.
That's Scotch, if I ever smelled anything.
The Scotch is on me, the gin is on Liza.
How do you do, Monster?
Well, what are you doing with Scotch all over you and gin all over Liza?
- We just started to have a simple drink.
- A drink?
No one had a drink, simple or otherwise.
We merely spilled it on ourselves.
There, you see?
Perfectly innocent.
Okay.
I burned up a lot of sugar on account of you.
I came over here to bruise you up, Mr. Stephens.
You have no right to spy on me, Mr. Grogan.
- It's a free country and I'm a citizen.
- Perfectly free, as far as I'm concerned.
- May I have my hand back?
- Okay.
Pleased to meet you.
I have since learned that there's no maturity and fascination between us thanks to Samantha here.
- Samantha?
Pay no attention to him, Darrin.
What does he mean "Samantha"?
Don't let this big clod bother you, Darrin.
Listen to me, both of you.
It's time you went about your own business.
- But my thesis.
- Lf you have more questions submit them in writing.
- But, Darrin - No buts.
Goodbye and good luck.
- Thank you.
Goodbye, Samantha.
Well, that's quite a conquest you've made there.
Well, he's really quite a nice young man.
Oh, I suppose under all that sinew and tendon beats a heart of pure protein.
Oh, Darrin.
Oh, Darrin, what?
Well, I mean, you're Oh, Darrin, you're not I mean I mean what I mean.
You say what you've got to say.
You're jealous.
Don't be ridiculous.
Me, jealous of a Typical American schoolkid with freckles, short socks and sneakers.
Well, I I suppose you're pretty proud of yourself?
She's a very charming person.
Something that you don't have the faintest idea how to be.
Well, what's so unusual about having charm?
It comes with age, like wrinkles.
You're jealous!
Me, jealous?
You've got to be kidding!
Sure, Liza Randall, the most irresistible thing to come along since Brigitte Bardot.
You're jealous.
Don't you laugh at me, you monster, or so help me.
I want you to know I'm really very flattered by this whole thing.
You should be.
Liza happens to be an extremely pretty girl.
I was talking about Monster.
We had quite a morning.
- He was here all morning?
- Oh, yes, he arrived just after you left.
He wanted to break you in half.
Only my charm and three square meals kept you in one piece.
I want you to know I put up quite a valiant fight myself today.
Oh, really?
It was touch-and-go there for a moment.
Touch what and go where?
Are you telling me it wasn't you who lured him to his office it was him that lured you?
- Monster, it was his idea, I swear.
- Liza, if you're lying - lf my project wasn't so important I'd have gone shopping with my mother.
- That does it.
- Oh, Monster!
I don't mind telling you that child got aggressive.
Child?
That's as fully developed a woman as I've seen in many a day.
You said she was a typical American schoolkid.
It doesn't matter.
You must've given her encouragement.
I did nothing of the kind.
I was explaining the rise and fall of a public-acceptance survey chart.
She tried to get me drunk.
Do you really expect me to believe that?
Of course I do, as much as you expect me to believe you were protecting me from Marvin all morning.
- Well, I was.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
That big clod wouldn't hurt a flea.
- What did you say?
- I said, he wouldn't hurt a flea.
You said I was ridiculous.
- Who said you were ridiculous?
Me?
- Yes.
That's what you said.
- Let's not fight about it.
- Well, that's exactly what you're doing.
I'm not fighting.
This is no fight.
You're fighting.
It takes two to make a fight.
You started it, that's one.
And you started it with me, that's two.
Don't be ridiculous.
All I said was that big clod wouldn't hurt a flea.
Monster, don't lose your temper.
I'm not gonna lose my temper.
I'm merely gonna teach him that when a man has a wife like Samantha he shouldn't go after a girl like Liza, who's got a boyfriend like me.
- Now, listen to me.
- Now, Darrin, don't fight with him.
I've had enough of this silly farce.
Now, what is it you intend to do?
- I intend to close your jaw.
- You and who else?
Darrin, no.
Well, have you had enough?
Why don't you try one there.
Oh, my hands.
Oh, let me see, Monster.
You ruined his hands, he may never make another pass.
- I don't think that'll stop him.
- I think she means football.
Oh, you monster.
Let's get out of here, Liza.
I gotta go soak my hands.
Come on, Marvin.
Hey, that's the first time you've ever called me Marvin.
Why did you let that little girl hit me?
Well, sweetheart, all things considered, it was the least I could do.
You're still angry, aren't you?
Why would you say that?
All right, you're surrounded.
Throw down your magic, and come out with your hands up.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
I thought all it needed was the antenna.
Oh, no.
No, lady, that was just part of it.
Your oscillator variation control is out.
Your audio analyser is burned and that TV filter, well, that's all shredded.
It's gonna be a job.
Big job.
Can I use your phone?
- Yes, of course.
It's in the kitchen.
- Thanks.
Yeah, I put the antenna up.
Then I stripped down the set.
Ought to be worth about 40 bucks to put it back together again.
How did you?
Nail file.
They're putting a new train in service.
Leaves the city at 10 p.m. - How about that?
- Don't tell me.
That's a gentle way of saying you have to work nights again.
Nothing like it.
My evenings with you are worth more than success or gold.
I should think Larry would want you to save your strength.
He'd go out of business if you got sick.
Samantha.
I have to speak to you.
- What's the matter?
- I can't talk in front of him.
It's extremely urgent.
There is nothing you can't say to me that you can't say in front of Darrin.
Well, get rid of him!
And hurry up, it's cold in here.
- What did you say, dear?
- I said it was sweet of you to say so.
Say what?
About my being more important to you than gold.
- I like the thought.
- Sincerely said and honestly felt.
Samantha, I advise you to listen to me.
What is it, Mother?
It's your father.
He's coming to see you.
- Father?
- What did you say, honey?
Nothing, darling.
That's funny.
You know, for a moment there I thought you were talking to the dishes.
- Father's coming here?
- Yes, he is, tonight.
- And he knows you're married.
- Well, why so secretive?
Don't you realise what that means, Samantha?
Of course.
Oh, it'll be wonderful seeing him again, and - Oh, no.
- Exactly.
- How are you going to explain Duncan?
- Darrin.
His name will be mud when your father finds out he's human.
Maybe we'd just as well face it now.
I'm married, and there's nothing he can do about it.
I shudder to think how many things he can and probably will do about it.
What am I going to do?
- Your father?
- Yes.
He knows I'm married and he's coming to see me tonight.
- When did you find out about this?
- Just now.
You were talking to the dishes.
I was talking to Mother.
She was trying to be unobtrusive.
Well, so your father's coming.
I'd like to meet him.
Father doesn't approve of mixed marriages.
Well, neither does your mother, but we worked that out.
Sort of.
But Father's different.
He's got a terrible temper.
Honey, it's time he faced the fact.
You're married to me, what can he do about it?
That's what he can do about it.
- You're kidding.
- No, Darrin, I'm not kidding.
I know my father.
And I better break the news to him alone.
Okay.
Okay, but I'm coming home right afterwards.
Darrin.
- Darrin, look these over, will you?
- Yeah, sure, Larry.
Get on it this afternoon, we'll talk about it on the train.
I forgot to tell you, Larry.
I won't be going home tonight.
Oh, really?
Oh, really.
Come on now, Larry.
I'm going to stay in town and have dinner.
- Trouble with Samantha?
- No, of course not.
Then why can't you go home?
My father-in-law is coming over tonight and Samantha hasn't told him about me.
So what?
He should be proud to have the finest account executive of McMann & Tate for a son-in-law.
I'm afraid that wouldn't impress him very much.
You're a fine human being, Darrin.
What more does he want?
If I told you, you'd never believe me.
I've got to be strong with Daddy.
After all, I'm not a child anymore.
Better be careful or you won't be a bride anymore.
It's not fair.
No one tells him how to run his life.
Well, first of all, your father doesn't run his life.
He choreographs it.
Well, I don't care what he does.
When he gets here, I'm going to stand right up to him.
Father.
Samantha, of course it is.
You've got to be my daughter.
You're positively gorgeous.
Well, what about yourself, you look marvellous.
Yes, I suppose I do.
All right, Charles, I shan't be needing you anymore.
Endora.
My love, nice to see you.
Oh, it's nice to see you too, Maurice.
How are you?
- In excellent health, thank you.
- You wouldn't have it any other way.
Of course not.
Close your eyes and reach in my pocket.
- You brought me something?
- Haven't I always?
Oh, Father.
It's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
It's the most beautiful thing anyone has ever seen.
- Endora, a little something for you.
- Oh, thank you, Maurice.
Oh, how very thoughtful of you.
From that charming little shop in Zürich, remember?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I remember.
Is that disagreeable little clerk still there?
Oh, yes, he's there.
And still disagreeable.
- But very, very little.
- Oh, Maurice, you shouldn't have.
- It was nothing.
- Oh, not the gift, the clerk.
I haven't brought anything for the man at the house but then what can you create for a man who has everything?
What's his name?
Darrell?
Denny?
Dinny?
- Donald.
- Darrin.
Darrin.
Darrin, that's a good name.
It's got a good sound to it.
Darrin.
Darrin what?
- Stephens.
- Stephens?
- I don't think I've ever flown into them.
- Massachusetts, very old stock.
- Good.
Are you happy?
- Yes, I am.
That's all that's important.
That's what I've always wanted for you.
- You really mean that, Father?
- Of course I do.
- Then I have something to tell you.
- Marry the right man, you'll be happy.
- The right man?
- Haven't I always said that?
Find the man of whom I approve, and he'll make you happy.
Do you remember my telling you that?
Yes, now that you mention it.
Doesn't make sense.
Why should he be against your marriage?
He just doesn't approve of mixed marriages.
Oh, I didn't know you were mixed.
Oh, yes.
I'm English and she's Norwegian.
- That's a mixed marriage?
- To her father it is.
- What is he, a Viking?
- Worse.
Well, where is he?
When am I going to get a look at him?
- Well, he's not here.
Is he, Mother?
- I hope not.
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, if he was here he wouldn't be where he was supposed to be.
Isn't that right, Samantha?
Yes.
Yes, Mother, that's right.
And he's supposed to be in Washington.
- What do you think of him, Endora?
- Well, I I think he'll surprise you.
Good.
Good.
Look, Darrin, you love Samantha, don't you?
- Certainly.
- Well, then you have to fight for her.
Stand up to the old man.
What can he do to you?
Point a finger at you and blow you up like you were made of glass?
It's a shame I'm not going to see that young man of yours.
Yes, well, it's too bad you can't stay longer.
Darrin should be home in a few days.
He's been working so hard lately.
Well, aren't you going to answer it?
- The telephone?
- Yes.
Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
Hello?
- Oh, hello, Darrin.
How are you?
- I'm in a bar, getting drunk.
You're so far away, I can hardly hear you.
He's so far away, I can hardly hear him.
- You won't be home for a week.
- Why not?
Oh, that's a shame.
You see, my father dropped in tonight and I was hoping the two of you would meet.
If you think I'll spend a week in this bar, you're out of your mind.
Oh, no.
No, of course not.
Just a moment.
I think I better take this in the other room.
You understand.
Of course.
Go ahead, darling.
She's turned into quite a girl.
Chip off the old block, eh?
If you say so, Maurice.
Chanson du Mer '59.
Quite like old times.
Brussels.
Remember I'épaule de mouton?
What a weekend that was.
We were never in Brussels together, Maurice.
Of course we were, I remember distinctly.
You were No, no, perhaps you're right.
You always did have a memory like a steel trap, Endora.
Chanson du Mer '59, '53 was much better.
No '53.
Oh, well, probably only half a dozen bottles left.
- Darrin, you can't!
- I don't care, Sam.
I'm coming home.
I beg of you, Darrin.
Please don't come home.
Please listen to me.
I'm through listening.
Goodbye.
Hello?
Hello, Darrin?
Please understand I'm doing this for your own good.
Larry!
Larry, get me out of here!
- What's the matter?
- What do you mean, what's the matter?
- I'm stuck in here.
- Oh, come on, pull on it.
Pull.
What's wrong with this door?
There's Darrin.
We were on our honeymoon.
Nice-Iooking boy.
What's this?
That's Darrin when he was a lieutenant.
- Well, what's he doing in the service?
- Everybody goes into the service.
Everybody, perhaps, but not us.
Well, you see, it's really very simple.
He's He's what?
He's patriotic.
He's always been patriotic.
I have pictures of him in World War I, the Spanish-American War and the War of 1812.
Before that, I have paintings.
Well, come on, fellas.
Easy.
Down easy.
Easy does it.
Yeah, we'll have you out in a few minutes, Darrin.
- Okay.
- Did you talk to her?
- You bet your life I did.
- What did she say?
She said not to come home, but I said I had enough.
- I'm coming home right now.
- Want me to drive you?
No, it's too far, but there's a new train in service, Larry but I don't know what time it leaves.
- Have you got a dime?
- Yeah.
Here you are.
Thanks, Larry.
I have in this hand a certificate testifying to the birth of a male child named Stephens first name Darrin mother, Phyllis, father, Frank.
Would you care to explain?
Yes.
Yes, I would.
- It's a front to fool the neighbours.
- I tried that.
It almost worked.
Almost?
I also found this.
"Darrin Stephens.
One capsule after each meal.
Two before bedtime".
Does the front to fool the neighbours extend to the bathroom medicine cabinet?
No, of course not.
Then why would a warlock be needing medicine unless, of course, he's not a warlock at all?
Can you tell me when the last train leaves for Morning Glory Circle?
Thank you.
Twenty minutes.
Larry, can you have me out of here by then?
Don't worry.
If we can't, we'll ship you railroad express.
- Is he or isn't he?
- Father, please.
Just tell me the truth.
Is my son-in-law a warlock or not?
- You won't get angry?
- I reserve that privilege.
Father, please sit down.
It's true.
Darrin is mortal.
You're not angry, are you?
Father, please.
Maurice, control yourself.
Father, your temper.
Stop carrying on.
Stop acting like a child.
Oh, Maurice, you're being ridiculous.
And you, I turn my back and what happens?
She marries a common, ordinary mortal.
Darrin is neither common nor ordinary.
- I am not talking to you.
- Times have changed, Maurice.
- This happens in the best of families.
- It does not happen in my family.
Well, it has.
It's over and done with.
I'm married.
And I am going to annul the marriage, Samantha, forever.
- Washington, eh?
- Father.
Mother.
Very good, Endora.
- What have you done with him?
- Wouldn't you like to know.
Endora.
Perhaps you frighten Samantha, Maurice but you certainly don't frighten me.
Where is he?
You're getting stronger, Endora.
- You're getting older, dear.
- I'll find him.
Wouldn't you like to bring in the evening paper, dear?
A flower, a bird, a tree.
What do you think, Samantha?
- What's that you have there?
- Just the evening paper.
I can't understand it.
A girl of your background, your breeding.
I can't understand.
Yes, I can.
- It shows a complete lack of respect.
- Please!
You young people are all the same: No feeling for tradition, no sense of history.
It's a disgrace.
- Are you all right, darling?
- Yes.
Yes, I'm all right.
Excuse me, sweetheart.
Now, look, you.
So far I've been locked in a phone booth turned into a newspaper, I've been banged on one end and burned on the other.
I may be a source of amusement but I'm also married to your daughter.
She loves me and I love her.
We're gonna stay married whether you like it or not.
Is that clear?
I have to admit, he has courage.
- You certainly picked a good one.
- I told you, Father.
It's a shame I have to do this.
Father!
Father, how could you?
- I did it for your own good, Samantha.
- Maurice, you have no right.
- You keep out of this, Endora.
- Bring him back.
- Father, please bring him back.
- Someday you'll thank me for this.
Thank you?
I never want to see you again.
You don't really mean that, you're excited.
How dare you speak like that to your father?
Maurice I'm not overly fond of that boy either but I won't have a human being on my conscience.
Bring him back.
I'm sorry, Endora.
What's done is done.
You bring him back, or I'll make your life miserable for you.
And you know I can do it.
I'll move in with you.
Father, if you love me, please bring him back.
Does it really mean that much to you?
I love him.
With all my heart, I love him.
Please don't take him away from me.
Very well.
I'll try.
What do you mean, try?
I'm sorry, Endora.
I gave him a terrible jolt.
Don't waste time, do something.
- Well?
- I'm trying.
Please, Father, I know you can do it.
He's doing it.
You're doing it!
Where's the rest of him?
That's it.
That's it, Maurice.
You have it in you.
I know you have.
- Keep it up, keep it up.
- Oh, go to it, Maurice.
Go to it.
Oh, look at that technique.
Please try harder, Daddy.
He did it!
He did it!
- Oh, Darrin.
- Very good.
Very good indeed.
- Is that all of him?
- Yes.
That's all of him.
You all right, Darrin?
Well here we are.
Just one big, happy family.
Of course, we haven't discussed it much but I'm partial to large families.
- Oh, yes, so am I. Four or five, at least.
Grandchildren might be a good idea.
What do you think, Endora?
There's no need to rush on my account.
Oh, no.
No, of course not.
We have plenty of time.
But there's something I should tell you.
- Lf the first one's a boy - Now, none of the silly sentimentality.
You don't have to name the baby after me.
Oh, well, I'm glad you feel that way, Daddy because Darrin promised his father that we'd name the first boy after him.
Oh, well, I suppose some people need that.
Well, I must fly.
But before I go, I want to propose a toast, Chanson du Mer '59.
Fifty-nine?
For this family?
Nothing doing.
How about '53?
Chanson du Mer '53.
Chanson du Mer '53.
Are you?
- Are you sure he's not one of us?
- It isn't chilled though.
He's not one of us.
It's chilled, my boy.
Perfect.
Although I take a dim view of most mortals you've made a favourable impression, Donald.
- Darwin.
- Darrin.
After a century or two I might get to like you as well as I like this champagne.
Too bad you won't be around that long.
Happiness, darling.
Delightful to see you again, my love.
One and all, auf Wiedersehen.
- Goodbye, Daddy.
- Yes, goodbye, Mr Daddy.
Au rev oir, Maurice.
He always was very big on exits.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
- Mother.
- Good morning, darling.
I have a feeling you're trying to tell me something.
Those were in you-know-who's briefcase.
- So?
- Well, don't you care if he carries pictures of other women?
Mother, in the advertising business, other women are merely tools of the trade.
- Oh, blind faith is unbecoming to you, Samantha.
Don't you understand?
I trust Darrin.
You wouldn't turn a child lose in a candy store, would you?
Darrin is not a child.
Well, he's only human.
Isn't that the excuse they always make for themselves, "I'm only human"?
They know their limitations better than we do.
Well, I don't think of Darrin as being merely human.
I think of him as being a cut above the ordinary mortal man.
How can a witch of mine be so naive?
Mother, will you please go away.
Very well, very well, I'm leaving.
But remember, Samantha no mortal pulls the wool over a witch's eyes while I'm around.
What are these doing here?
Thought I left them in my briefcase.
You better eat your breakfast.
You'll be late.
I've been looking at girls for weeks.
Yes, I suppose that could get tiring after a while.
You're not kidding.
Which one do you like best?
- For what?
- Miss Jasmine, the perfume account.
Oh, yes.
Of course.
Well, let's see, now.
This one has lovely eyes.
And this one has a beautiful mouth.
This one has a great figure.
Gee, I don't know.
Why don't you cut out the best piece of each and paste them together like I used to do.
With paper dolls.
Look, I'm serious, Sam.
The campaign starts tomorrow, and we haven't picked a Miss Jasmine.
Incidentally, we have to forget about having lunch together today.
- How about tomorrow?
- Well, all right.
As long as you promise to have lunch alone today and not enjoy it.
I'll do better than that.
I'll have lunch with Larry Tate and really be miserable.
Better get going.
You better get going.
Okay.
But remember, you threw me out.
- So, what do you think?
- Marvellous.
Incredible.
Some of the most gorgeous creatures I ever laid eyes on, but I still haven't seen that je ne sais quoi that ethereal quality we need in a Miss Jasmine.
Courage, old friend.
Don't lose faith, we'll find her.
I know that.
I was just thinking about going home to Louise tonight.
I don't know, after a week of looking at these, it seems pointless somehow.
- Now, Larry, you've got a lovely wife.
- I suppose so.
If you'll excuse me, Darrin, I'm going out to try and wipe out the memory of all this.
I never could stand too much of a good thing.
- Yes?
- I hoped you'd say that.
- I beg your pardon?
- Aren't you looking for a Miss Jasmine?
I was.
I mean, we are.
- Won't you sit down, Miss?
- Janine Fleur.
Thank you.
Have you done much modelling, Miss Fleur?
I'm sure I could be everything you want in a Miss Jasmine, that is.
You might.
Yes, you just might.
Hello, Larry?
Can you come in here for a minute?
Good.
- Is something wrong?
- Wrong?
No.
You may solve a very big problem for me, Miss Fleur.
- Janine.
- Well?
Well Well.
I'm thinking exactly what you're thinking, Larry.
I won't say anything if you won't.
You've been very quiet tonight.
You have a bad day at the office?
Oh, it wasn't a bad day.
It wasn't a good day.
As a matter of fact, it wasn't a bad day.
Well, don't commit yourself.
Anything new on Miss Jasmine?
- We found one.
- You did?
Oh, that's marvellous.
What's she look like?
- Attractive.
- Attractive?
You said you needed something gorgeous.
Well, she's sort of gorgeous.
- She's blond, I'll bet.
- No, not really.
Well, what's she look like?
Tall, straight nose, experienced.
Well, that could be Abraham Lincoln.
I said she was pretty.
You said she was attractive.
There's a difference.
- What's her name?
- Janine Fleur.
Oh, sounds like perfume.
- Does she look like she sounds?
- You could say that.
I haven't seen her.
What do you say?
- Yes.
- Yes, what?
She sounds like perfume, she looks like perfume she even smells like perfume.
- You smelled her?
No, of course not.
Not deliberately.
She's exactly what Larry and I have been looking for.
Well, that's wonderful.
Now, how would you like to go to the movies, eat popcorn and smooch?
I would love to but I've got to work on some exploitation ideas.
He's very evasive.
That shows interest.
He is only interested in that woman because of business.
You'd better make it your business.
Did you notice that he kissed you on your forehead?
The next thing you know, he'll be patting your hand.

- What happened?
- You were having a nightmare.
- Didn't seem like one.
- I say it was.
I know a nightmare when I see one.
Go back to sleep, dear.
- Well?
- I'd like to change her position a bit.
Figures.
Here, Janine, why don't you try your hand here, stroking the bear's nose.
Thank you.
There you go.
You keep moving her around, we'll be here all day.
I think we've got it now.
Hold it.
- Thank you.
Is that lunch?
- Go ahead.
Lunch, Janine.
Oh, wonderful idea.
I'm starving.
Where shall we go?
We?
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm meeting my wife.
Well, I wouldn't ask you or interfere, except that it's - Well, never mind.
- Well, what is it?
Well, it's probably foolish, but I think you'd better get another Miss Jasmine.
Another Miss Jasmine?
What for?
Now, hold it.
I think we better talk about this.
- But your lunch.
- I'll cancel it.
- Please don't do that because of me.
- My wife will understand.
She knows that at the moment the most important thing is Jasmine Perfume.
- Go and change, and I'll give her a call.
- All right, I'll hurry.
Hello?
Oh, hi, darling.
I was just leaving.
What?
Oh, no, no.
I understand.
Yes, well, you go ahead.
I'll see you tonight.
Well, well, well.
All dressed up and nowhere to go.
- I am going to have lunch with Darrin.
- Really?
One of these days when he's not too busy.
- Oh, I understand, dear.
- No, you don't.
You think my husband is taking another woman to lunch.
- I haven't said a word.
- Well, it's business.
Oh, yes, of course.
Well, I was going to suggest that perhaps we could have lunch together.
Oh, certainly.
You know where Darrin is so you're gonna bring me face to face with him to prove your point.
- I never suggested it.
- I won't.
- Very well.
- I'll tell you what I'll do.
- What?
- I am going to take you there and bring you face to face with Darrin to prove my point.
Wait for me, Samantha.
Oh, isn't this delightful.
We must have a waiter.
Waiter.
Menu.
Thank you.
- Mother, are you sure he's here?
- Quite sure.
Oh, they have Coquille St. Jacques.
They make it marvellously here.
Mother.
I don't believe it.
I'm sure I will.
Where is he?
I know this is upsetting for you, darling but I'm not in the least surprised.
But, Mother, why?
I thought he was happy with me.
It's the spirit of conquest.
It's a disease of mortal men.
Like chickenpox.
Just a moment.
- That girl - I know how you feel, Samantha but I do think we ought to leave before they see us.
Now, Samantha!
You're not going to create a scene!
All right.
Come off it, Sara.
Dignity, Samantha, dignity.
Well, hello, Samantha.
My, it has been a long time, hasn't it.
Sara Baker.
I should've known.
She's one of us, Mother, although I hate to admit it.
Just what do you think you're doing with my husband?
Your husband?
Now, I heard you'd done something foolish but I never thought for a moment - You haven't answered my question.
Well, that must be obvious.
I'm Miss Jasmine.
Well, now, I must say I've had enormous respect for Darrin's taste up until now.
Now, just a moment, blithe spirit.
Watch your tone, my girl, you're speaking to my daughter.
Oh, really?
Well, now, look who's suddenly so concerned.
- What does that mean?
- Pay no attention to her.
You seem terribly solicitous for someone so anxious for me to test your mate's mettle.
Mother!
If there's one thing I cannot abide, it's a stool pigeon.
What did you think you'd prove by siccing this broom rider on Darrin?
Easy, Samantha.
Be careful what you say.
Well, you haven't proved a thing.
Even Sir Galahad wouldn't be safe with her.
That's better.
Now that this masquerade is over, I trust it won't be necessary to ask you again.
Stay away from Darrin, Sara.
Is that clear?
Well, she certainly is sensitive, isn't she?
Pity, I was just starting to enjoy myself.
I appreciate your efforts on my behalf, Sara Baker but now you'll do as my daughter asked.
You know how difficult it is for me to leave something unfinished, Endora.
Force yourself.
All of us at McMann & Tate are behind you 100 percent to make you the best Miss Jasmine there ever was.
- I want you to believe that.
- I do believe you, Darrin and I won't think about leaving again.
You wouldn't want me to start something I couldn't finish?
Of course not.
I want Where did all the time go?
We haven't even had our lunch.
We'd better get back.
- We'll talk about this some other time.
- Oh, yes, indeed.
Some other time.
Waiter.
Hello?
Oh, hello, darling.
How are you?
You're not?
Yes, dear.
Business.
Miss Jasmine.
Oh, I understand.
No, I'm fine.
Yes, sweetheart.
See you later.
- She won't give up, eh?
- That home-wrecking harpy.
Professional pride, I suppose.
She's not gonna get away with it.
I'm gonna tell Darrin that she's a witch.
I wouldn't try to convince him he's susceptible to witches, Samantha.
I never used one single spell on Darrin.
You may have a difficult time convincing him of that.
Mother, what am I going to do?
You have no choice.
I guess not.
I suppose every woman has to face this at one time or another.
Darrin will just have to be on his own with no help from anyone.
- Yes, but, darling - And so will I. - All finished?
- Almost.
How are things coming with Miss Jasmine?
I think we're getting some good layouts.
Fine.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
Where you going?
- Home.
- Do you have to?
- Yes.
- Louise is waiting for you, I suppose.
Well, is it urgent that you go home right at this minute?
Not if you have somewhere else for me to go.
- I do have.
- Where?
Janine Fleur's apartment.
- Really?
- With me.
- Why?
- I've got business to take care of with Janine, and I'd rather not do it alone.
I brought Larry along to approve some of these changes you asked me to come over and make.
Yes, of course.
May I fix you both a drink?
- Yes, thank you.
- No, thank you.
Just a little one.
Well, fine.
Larry, these television spots need a little Larry.
Oh, yes.
They certainly do need a little.
Yes.
- I was going to say "fixing".
- I'm not arguing with you.
There you are.
Well, here's to your very good health, Miss Fleur.
- Of course.
- Thank you.
- Are they all right?
- Mine's wonderful.
I think I'll lay down and take a nap.
Meantime, I'll take care of Janine.
Isn't it getting crowded in here?
Sara, I'm going to lay it right on the line with you.
I love my husband, and I also have a great deal of faith in him.
Oh, is that why you're here?
Looking after him?
He can take care of himself as long as you don't pull anything fancy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, of course not.
He was suddenly bitten by a tsetse fly.
Samoan lotus leaf.
Now, at least let him act of his own free will.
I thought you had more pride than that.
Believe me, Samantha, I have no need of help.
If I'm going to lose Darrin to something like you it's better that I find out now.
Remember what I said.
His own free will.
And go over the papers right away.
Is that all right with you, Larry?
- Oh, sure.
- Why don't we sit over here.
- The light's a bit better.
- Oh, fine.
Come on over, Larry.
All right.
Yes, here we are.
Now, in this first set-up - Why don't you go on home, Larry.
- I'd be glad to.
Two's company and three's a crowd.
- Where you going, Larry?
- Home, I think.
Well, what for?
I don't know, but I don't think it was my idea.
- Well, wait for me, will you?
- Sure.
I think I need another drink.
All right, now, I think the dialogue that probably gives you the most trouble is on page three.
- You're absolutely right.
- It seems to me, if you said: "Jasmine introduces a new sensation" rather than "a new essence" that might make it easier.
Wouldn't you say so, Larry?
Larry?
That's the strangest thing I've ever seen.
He keeps going to - Kiss you.
- What did you say?
I said, I wanna kiss you more than anything else in the world.
Go ahead.
What in?
That wasn't funny, Samantha.
Well, I warned you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd just as soon keep my husband alive.
Get out of here, or I'Il You'll what?
You know what I'm capable of doing.
I'd say we were pretty evenly matched.
Sort of reduces this to the human level, doesn't it?
How would you like a poke in the nose?
- I'm not a brawler.
- I didn't think so.
Pardon the intrusion.
- What did you do that for?
- I'm sorry, Darrin.
It slipped.
Never mind, I probably had it coming.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing, where were you?
I think I took another nap.
- I feel great.
- I'll see you tomorrow, Janine.
But, Darrin, we have things to talk about.
I don't mind breaking dinner dates with my wife for something important but there's nothing here that can't be fixed down at the office.
- Are you coming, Larry?
- You run along.
You're absolutely right.
Samantha must be concerned about you.
Suit yourself.
All right.
Well, now, Miss Fleur, suppose we talk about your problems.
Now what?
I realise that this is none of my business, Sara but Louise Tate happens to be a very dear friend.
Some other time.
My wife is waiting for me too.
Oh, yes, if you can't stay, I understand.
Then I wish you'd explain it to me.
Come in.
- Hello, darling.
- Hi, sweetheart.
This time I didn't take any chances.
I didn't phone, I just came right down.
I've got it written on my calendar in big red letters: - "Lunch, my wife, urgent".
- Good.
- Oh, is that Miss Jasmine?
- Yep, that's her.
Let's go, dear.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Hello.
- Samantha this is Louise Tate.
I'm at the corner filling station.
I must see you right away.
Right away?
Well, wouldn't it be better if I met you somewhere?
Oh, well, if it's that urgent, Louise yes, all right, I'll see you.
- I'll be right there.
Good.
Goodbye.
- Hello, Lou - Hello, Samantha.
Louise, what's the matter?
Has something happened to Darrin?
Oh, no.
No, of course not.
Is Larry all right?
Up till now, yes.
Well, for heaven sakes, Louise, what happened?
Samantha, Larry and I have been married for 16 years.
- Did you know that?
- Yes, of course.
Well, now, after all this time Has something happened between you and Larry?
Yes, finally.
Louise, no.
I'm going to be a mother.
Louise, no.
Yes.
The doctor just called to say the tests were positive.
I'm on my way to see him now.
Will you come with me, Samantha?
Oh, yes, of course.
I'm terrified.
Why?
It's the most wonderful thing that could ever happen to a woman.
I'm not so terrified at the thought of being a mother as I am of Larry being a father.
Larry will make a wonderful father.
What did he say when you told him?
- I'm afraid to tell him, Samantha.
- Afraid?
Well, after all these years, I don't think Larry is going to care for the idea.
- Besides, he hates children.
- Why?
He says they're too young.
Oh, my stars.
Come on, Louise.
Well, what is it?
- Cavity.
- A cavity?
Yeah, I think you better have it taken care of, Larry.
I guess I better go during my lunch hour.
That's a good idea.
Darrin how would you like to go with me?
- Well, what for?
I just thought if you weren't hungry, you'd like to spend your lunch with me.
- You're not scared, are you, Larry?
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I thought you could drive me back to the office from the medical centre.
That gas makes you a bit groggy, you know?
Gas?
Oh, he won't give you gas for that.
What do you mean no gas?
He'll drill the tooth, won't he?
Of course, but he'll probably give you a needle.
- You're not serious?
- To deaden the pain of the drill.
- What deadens the pain of the needle?
- Come on, Larry it's just a little stick.
It only lasts for a minute.
- Haven't you ever been to a dentist?
- Only once.
- My father took me.
- Well, how old were you?
Thirty-seven.
Don't laugh.
Everyone has their Achilles heel.
Mine happens to be in my mouth.
- I know when I tell Larry, he'll faint.
- Don't be silly.
Times like these, men become very strong.
- You really think so?
- I know it.
Then he'll probably hit me.
Louise.
And I just can't wait to see the look on Darrin's face when I tell him.
Why, that lucky son of a gun.
Oh, hi, Larry.
How did it go?
Larry, you all right?
Did they give you laughing gas or something?
Darrin Stephens, you are one lucky son of a gun.
- What?
- Who do you think I saw when I came out of the dentist?
- I don't know.
Who?
- Guess.
- I don't know.
Samantha.
What was she doing at the medical centre?
I didn't talk to her.
She didn't see me.
- Know where she went?
- No.
- Guess.
- I don't know.
- I don't suppose I ought to tell you.
- Certainly you ought to tell me.
All right.
- Sit down.
- I don't wanna sit down.
You lucky son of a gun.
- What are you talking about?
- Okay, okay.
Don't sit down.
But if you fall down, don't blame me, Papa.
- What did you say?
- You heard me.
Papa.
- Larry, are you serious?
- Of course I'm serious.
I saw her go in to Dr. Bricey's office.
Dr. Bricey, the obstetrician.
It's incredible.
Louise was with her, and I heard them talking.
Samantha said she couldn't wait to see the look on your face when she told you.
It's incredible.
I'll call her.
No, no, no.
Don't do that.
This is the most important moment in a woman's life.
Let her give you the news in her own way.
You're right.
I won't say a word.
I'll let her tell me when she wants to.
I'll call her in case she wants to tell me.
Take it easy.
She hasn't had a chance to get home yet.
Yes, of course.
Mrs. Stephens is calling.
Remember, not one word.
You lucky son of a gun.
Hello, sweetheart.
- How are you feeling?
- Oh, I'm fine.
How are you?
Well, I'm fine.
I'm just fine.
She's fine.
Where are you, darling?
I'm in town, shopping, and I ran into Louise Tate.
Oh, that's wonderful, sweetheart.
Yes, isn't that nice?
We thought it might be good if you brought Larry home and the four of us could have dinner together.
Larry's there with him.
All right, sweetheart.
Yes, we'll see you at home.
- Larry wants to talk to you.
- What do I say to him?
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Louise, you've been married to him for 16 years.
Hello, Larry.
Yes, dear.
Oh, certainly, dear.
Goodbye, dear.
Darrin thought dinner was an excellent idea as long as I didn't stand on my feet too long.
I tell you, that husband of mine is one kind and considerate man.
Seems like I've got a pretty kind and considerate husband myself.
- Oh, what did he say?
- He told me to cook the dinner.
He doesn't want you to stand on your feet too long, either.
It'll be great for you, the best thing that ever happened.
It'll be wonderful.
Oh, children are marvellous when you're young.
Of course, when you get old and tired and impatient that's a different story.
- That doesn't sound like you, Larry.
It isn't me.
I meant Louise.
Well, lucky, what do you think it'll be?
Well I haven't the faintest idea.
Well, one thing's for sure, it'll be either a boy or a girl.
I certainly hope so.
Well, I'll see you around 7.
We'll head for home, Papa.
What do you think it'll be?
What do you think it'll be?
What do you think it'll be?
What do you think it'll be?
Yes, Miss Nelson.
Mrs. Stephens and the children are here, Mr. Stephens.
- Children?
- Yes, sir.
Shall I send them in?
Yes, of course, send them in.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hello, darling.
Hope we didn't catch you when you're busy.
Oh, no, no, no.
Of course not, sweetheart.
I'm taking the children to lunch, then to the park.
Swell.
I'Il - Get down from there.
- Okay, Daddy.
Oh, no.
- Mama.
- Yes, Rebecca.
Samuel has to, you know You take him, dear.
Okay.
Come on, Samuel.
Samantha, are all our children?
Of course, darling.
What did you expect?
Mother, you tell Maurice to give me back my candy.
Oh, yeah?
Well, you're getting too fat anyway.
Don't you dare say that again.
Fat, fat, the water rat.
Samantha, do something.
Now, Endora, you change your brother back immediately, do you hear?
- Do I have to?
- Yes, of course.
Okay.
Are you sure you can't come to the park with us?
No, I don't think I can.
I mean, I've got so much to do, I better not.
Oh, all right, sweetheart.
We'll see you at home.
Now, now, now, children, we've disturbed your father enough.
Last one to the park is a rotten egg.
All right, now, all together.
One two, three.
Hey, Mom!
Come on, Julius.
Sam what have we done?
Gladys, even if there was a pool, you can't find it now.
It's dark out.
I don't know what they did with it, but it's here somewhere.
I've gotta find it.
- We'll get arrested, Gladys.
- Not if you don't yell.
Why don't you stop the noise and help me look.
- I looked already.
- Where did you look?
I looked in the garage.
There is no swimming pool.
I examined the yard from one end to the other, no swimming pool.
I even looked around the back, under the garbage cans.
There is no swimming pool.
Look once again, Abner.
- When do you think they'll be here?
- Any minute, now.
- Why don't you try to relax?
- I can't relax.
I'm scared to death.
Have something to munch on.
That'll calm you.
That's a good idea.
Do you have any Indian nuts?
No, I don't think so.
Lately, I'm crazy about them.
Isn't that ridiculous?
Oh, there they are.
Now, you just relax.
I'll get it.
Good evening, Mr. Kravitz, Mrs. Kravitz.
Good evening.
Mrs. Stephens, do you have a swimming pool?
No.
No, we don't.
Are you absolutely sure?
Yes, of course.
Thank you.
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
Good night.
Gladys.
Gladys.
What in the world would make them think we had a swimming pool?
That's Darrin's car.
Oh, Samantha, what am I gonna do?
Just get hold of yourself.
This is the most important moment of your life.
Will you stop fussing?
You look gorgeous.
- Hello, darling.
- Hi there.
Hello.
- How are you feeling?
- I'm just fine.
- These are for you.
- Oh, thank you.
And so are these.
- Hi, Louise.
- Hi, Louise.
- You look lovely.
- You certainly do.
- That's a beautiful dress.
- And you smell beautiful too.
- How about that perfume, Darrin?
- It's perfect.
Well, aren't you both nice.
- I'll go and put these in some water.
- I'll help you.
Has anyone noticed how lovely Louise looks?
- Certainly did.
- You look very pretty, Louise.
I don't smell bad, either.
Would you like to try me?
- How did everything go today, darling?
- Wonderfully.
I got a little shopping done.
- Sure you didn't get too tired?
- No, no, not at all.
I feel wonderful.
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.
We're both fine.
That's fine.
- Who's for a martini?
- Great idea.
- I'll have one.
- Me too.
- You think you ought to, Samantha?
- Sure, why not?
- Well, I mean, maybe - Maybe it'll spoil your appetite.
Oh, nothing can spoil my appetite.
Well, all right, but just one.
A little one.
- I'll have one.
- Here you are, Samantha.
Thank you.
I'll take this with me, and I'll check on dinner.
I'll carry it for you, sweetheart.
It isn't heavy.
Well, I like to make things easier for you whenever I can.
I'll have one.
Larry, I'd like a drink.
All you have to do is ask.
- New dress?
- Yes, you like it?
- I might.
How much did it cost?
- Not very much.
I'm crazy about it.
Here you are.
- A little tight, isn't it?
- Tight?
Oh, well - Larry, I'd like to talk to you.
- Well?
Larry, you're not an old man.
You're a very young man, really.
- What are you talking about?
- Well, what I mean is it's not too late.
- Too late for what?
Well, it's not too late for an old man who really isn't old to be a young man, really.
Are you sick or something?
No, I'm not sick, but I want another martini.
Never seen you down one that fast before.
You better take it easy.
I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself.
I was thinking about your weight.
- What about my weight?
- Well, martinis are fattening.
- Two of them?
- It all adds up.
You know, I've been noticing.
Lately, you're getting a little thicker in the waist.
- I am?
- It's nothing to get panicky about but you could try a little exercise pushups or knee bends, or something.
- I can't do that, Larry.
- Why not?
- I'm going to have - Dinner's on the table.
- Come and get it, Louise.
Larry.
- Okay.
- Going to have what?
- You're gonna have what?
I'm going to have dinner.
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
Aren't you sweet.
- Comfortable?
- I certainly am.
Now, you all better eat before this gets cold.
- Smells marvellous.
- Here, Louise.
Louise.
Well, what's wrong?
Aren't you hungry?
Larry, I have something to say, and I'm going to say it.
- Is something wrong, Louise?
- I only meant it as a joke.
- Good girl, Louise.
- Well, what is it?
This morning, Samantha and I went downtown to see a doctor.
- What happened?
- He kicked me.
I'm sorry, my foot slipped.
It was an accident.
Go ahead, Louise.
We went to see Dr. Bricey.
- And, Larry, you know what?
- Yes, I know what.
You can't keep your mouth shut, that's what.
- Larry.
- Well, I'm sorry.
I know you were at Dr. Bricey's.
I saw you.
You mean, you know?
Of course I know.
Don't be angry, Larry.
It's made me very happy.
- I was hoping you'd feel the same way.
- I do.
I think it's marvellous.
But I also think that Samantha should be the one to tell Darrin.
It's all right with me.
Go ahead, Samantha.
- You sure?
- Go on.
- Tell him.
- All right.
- Darrin.
- Yes, dear.
Louise is gonna have a baby.
Who?
Congratulations, Darrin, you lucky son of a gun.
No two people in the world are dearer to me than you and Louise.
And now, there's going to be - Louise?
- Louise?
Louise.
You?
After all this time?
- I'm sorry, Larry.
- What do you mean sorry?
I think it's wonderful.
- How do you feel?
- My leg is killing me.
I can't understand why it took you so long to tell me.
- I didn't know how you'd feel about it.
- Great.
That's how I feel about it, just great.
You thought it was me.
I sure did.
That isn't all I thought.
What else?
It's not important.
When we do have a child what sort of child do you suppose it'll be?
Your guess is as good as mine.
Oh, I know it'll be a boy or a girl, won't it?
I imagine.
A boy or a girl what?
I don't know.
I just hope it'll be a happy child with your eyes and your hair.
And it would be nice if it had my
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
- Everything is just beautiful, Samantha.
- Thank you, Gertrude.
If I look a little green, it's pure envy.
I break out whenever I see a friend happily married.
Your turn will come.
- I know, but when?
- As soon as you meet the right man.
Have any idea where he's hiding?
I'll bet Darrin knows plenty of nice single men.
I don't wanna seem too eager, Samantha, but I'm always available.
I'll have him invite someone to dinner Friday night.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.
It's only an inexpensive replica.
It could be replaced.
- It didn't look inexpensive.
- Looks can be deceiving.
Now, are you gonna be able to come for dinner Friday night?
Sure, but I think you'd be better off inviting Hurricane Hannah.
- Don't be silly.
See you Friday night.
- Thanks.
What time Friday?
Eight o'clock.
I told you it could be replaced.
Honey, I'm home!
- Hi there, sweetheart.
- Hi, baby.
- Did you have a hard day at the office?
- The usual.
I bet you're glad to have a nice home to return to.
- You bet I am.
- Can I fix you a drink?
Thank you, sweetheart.
I bet some fellows at the office aren't that lucky.
- None of them are.
- Some probably aren't even married.
Are you driving at something, Sam?
- Why would you say that?
- Something about your approach.
There are probably lots of attractive bachelors at the office, aren't there?
Why?
Does every question have to have a "why" behind it?
Look, nobody asks a question like that without an ulterior motive.
Now own up.
What is it?
Do you have some single girlfriend looking for a husband?
Well, there is one lovely girl I know.
Who?
- Gertrude.
- Do I know her?
You met her at the hospital benefit.
Was she the one with?
No, that's Lola.
Was she the one with?
No, I think you're thinking about Nancy.
I am thinking about Nancy.
Forget about Nancy.
Think about Gertrude.
She didn't make much of an impression on me, Sam.
She'll make a fine impression on some poor Ionely boy at your office.
No, she won't.
I don't know any poor Ionely boys.
What about that artist friend of yours, Kermit?
Oh, you're kidding.
Kermit's having a ball being single.
Women throw themselves at his feet.
What a life that Kermit lives.
You were leading the same kind of life when you met me and you were glad to give it up.
Weren't you?
Sure, I was, Sam, but a girl like you doesn't come along every day.
Neither does a girl like Gertrude.
I have an idea.
Why don't you ask Kermit to dinner Friday night?
Sam, if there's one thing Kermit is not in the market for, it's a wife.
Darling, I'm just asking you to invite him to dinner not his wedding.
For me?
Please?
- Hi, Kermit.
- Hiya, Darrin.
- Boy.
- You like her?
- Who wouldn't?
- Her name's Susan.
- I know.
I met her with you a few times.
- Yeah, that's right.
I guess you're busy Friday night, aren't you?
Yeah, she asked me out to her place.
- That's that.
- That's what?
My wife had the crazy notion that you'd like to have dinner at our house.
- Is Samantha a good cook?
- Pretty good.
- I'll come.
- And walk away from that?
Well, I can always walk right back.
I hope.
What time?
- Dinner's at 8.
- I'll be there.
Hey, that's mine, buddy.
Oh, yeah.
Candles?
We always have candles when we have guests.
- Tonight I'd like the lights on.
- Why?
So Kermit can get a good look at your friend Gertrude.
Darling, don't make it sound as if I'm trying to put something over on him.
Well, aren't you?
When he gets to know her, he'll thank you for bringing them together.
If she were a girl that would make an impression on Kermit I'd remember her from the benefit.
Don't judge everybody's taste by your own, sweetheart.
- One man's meat is another - I know this man's taste, Sam.
Believe me.
- Now, you behave yourself.
- I'll try.
Hi, I hope I'm not late.
No, you're the first one here.
Come on in, Gertrude.
- Hi, Darrin.
Nice seeing you again.
- Hi, Gertrude.
Nice seeing you again.
Married life must agree with you.
You've put on a little weight.
Well, have I?
Well, you look just about the same.
Oh, really?
I better retreat to the powder room and see if I can do something about that.
- I don't remember her at all.
- Darrin.
I'll get it, honey.
- Hello, Darrin.
- Hi.
Come on in.
Thank you.
Hi, Samantha.
- Hello, Kermit.
- What will I do with this, Darrin?
Oh, my gosh.
Was it valuable?
- Don't ask.
- Don't kid.
Don't worry.
It can be replaced just like that.
Stop trying to frighten the poor man.
I'll do that.
- Hi, I'm Gertrude.
- Oh, I'm Kermit.
Thanks for setting me straight about that vase.
My old buddy here had me worried for a minute.
That vase happened to be an authentic relic.
So am I. Were you warned about me, or do I come as a horrible surprise?
You're a delightful surprise.
Tell me all about yourself.
It's a terribly uninteresting story.
Why don't you tell me all about you.
With pleasure.
You just happened to hit on my favourite subject.
He likes her.
Where did she get the idea that vase could be replaced?
Oh, don't worry about it, darling.
It can.
- Samantha, is Gertrude a?
- A what?
You know.
Really, Darrin.
Now come on.
They've taken to each other.
Isn't that nice?
Nice isn't the word.
It's strange.
You're surrounded by beautiful girls day and night.
- I must come as quite a shock.
- What do you mean?
- I'm not exactly the model type.
- You're a very lovely type.
And I wish you'd stop running yourself down.
Darrin, this girl is terrific.
Where have you been hiding her?
You'll have to ask my wife that question.
- What are you people drinking?
- I'll have a Crazy Charlie.
- What's that?
- It's my own invention.
It's Two parts vodka, one part gin and one part bicarbonate of soda.
How in the world did you know that?
I don't know.
I must be psychic.
I'll have a Crazy Charlie too.
It sounds interesting.
- Two Crazy Charlies coming up.
- Make that three.
Three Crazy Charlies, and one bicarb of soda.
Straight.
I can't get over you knowing about Crazy Charlie.
I bet you two find you have a lot of things in common.
Kermit, come here.
I need your help.
- I'll go.
- I want Kermit.
Excuse me.
What do you think of him?
As a rule, I don't like handsome men.
But he's the exception.
- Be careful.
- Of what?
- Gertrude.
- What's the matter with her?
I'm not sure.
She seems perfectly okay to me.
I know more about these things than you do.
- Since when?
- Since I got married.
Listen, chum, a marriage license is not a Master's degree.
- I know what I'm talking about.
- So do I. Take my advice.
Ignore that girl.
- I've got a better idea.
- What?
I'll ignore you.
Oh, Kermit.
Here.
Thank you.
It's different.
- So are you.
The curlew are passing over early this year.
- Don't tell me you're a bird lover.
- It's my one passion.
Don't tell me you are.
I have many hidden passions.
That's one.
Hey, I've got a great idea.
You want me to go bird watching with you tomorrow morning.
Gertrude, that's absolutely astonishing.
Confess.
You possess supernatural powers.
Samantha, can I speak to you in the kitchen for a minute?
- When?
- Now.
Excuse me.
Is Gertrude a witch?
Darrin, is that why you've been acting so funny?
- I've been acting funny?
!
- I'm glad you recognize it.
- Come on.
I want a straight answer.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.
- For Kermit's sake!
- Gertrude is no more of a witch than Than you are!
I thought so.
- I forgot myself for a minute.
- Oh, no, you didn't.
All right.
Gertrude is a witch.
All of my friends are witches.
We're just waiting for the right time to swoop down on Morning Glory Circle and claim it in the name of Beelzebub.
- Oh, come on, Sam, quit kidding.
- Who's kidding?
I have to check my roast.
- Sam.
- Yes, dear.
- Do something for me, will you?
- Anything.
- Tell me honestly, is she or isn't she?
- Is she or isn't she what?
Sam, this is serious.
Kermit stopped dating all of his old girlfriends.
He's gone out with Gertrude every single night.
That does sound serious.
What I wanna know is why?
Don't you think you ought to ask him?
I did ask Kermit.
He can't figure it out either.
It's obvious they like each other very much.
It's obvious she's a witch.
Does a girl have to be a witch to make a man give up all his old girlfriends?
If the man's Kermit and the girl's Gertrude, yes.
- That's ridiculous, Darrin.
- I know your tricks, Samantha.
I didn't use one single trick to bring them together.
- That proves she's a witch.
- How does that prove it?
How did she know about Crazy Charlie?
Well, I just did it to get them started.
She's very shy, you know.
And the curlew.
You brought them over a wee bit early this year, didn't you?
They were on their way anyway.
It was only a couple of weeks.
Do you realize this nonsense could end up with those two getting married?
- Wouldn't that be nice?
- A joke's a joke, but this is no joke.
He shouldn't be married under a spell.
Nobody gets married under a witch's spell.
We haven't got that kind of power.
- No?
- No.
A man meets a girl, they fall in love, and he asks her to marry him just like you asked me.
How do I know I wasn't under your spell?
Is that what you think?
I don't know what I think except I do think Gertrude's a witch.
What do you have against witches?
Well, nothing personally, but But what?
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
- Hi, Darrin.
- Kermit.
- Did you okay those layouts?
- Not yet.
- Kermit, I think we better have a talk.
- About what?
- The way you're treating your friends.
- What friends?
- For example, Susan.
- Susan?
You haven't called her since you met Gertrude.
I haven't gone out with anybody but Gertrude.
Is that any reason to turn your back on a friend like Susan?
Susan's not a friend.
She's a girl.
Susan is a person.
And she's interested in you as a person in your career, in your mind.
You've gotta be kidding.
Come on, okay those layouts, will you?
- I can't now.
I'm too busy.
- When will you be able to?
- Not until tomorrow.
- They have to go to the engravers.
- Maybe late tomorrow.
- How late?
- Ten o'clock.
- At night?
We'll have dinner and drinks.
I'll meet you at the Interlude at 10:00.
Of course I remember you, Darrin.
You work with that treacherous Kermit who hasn't called me in a month.
A spell?
Well, if he's been sick, I'm sure I can make him feel better.
All right.
The Interlude at 10.
I'll be there.
- Hello, Kermit?
- Sorry to disappoint you.
It's only me.
If I sound like a giddy girl in love, it's your fault.
- What are you doing tonight?
- I plan on going to sleep early.
It's the first night in weeks I won't see Kermit.
And I think I know why.
Kermit and Darrin are meeting at the Interlude tonight.
Darrin says it's business, but monkey business is more like it.
He doesn't know it yet, but I'm going along and I want you to meet me there at 10:00.
Good.
You know something, I miss Gertrude.
- That's sweet.
- It's crazy.
She's the only girl I never run out of conversation with.
- I think I'm gonna ask her to marry me.
- That's wonderful.
What made you suddenly think of a thing like that?
I didn't suddenly think of it.
I've thought about it for weeks.
- Hi.
- Susan.
- I hope I didn't keep you waiting.
- Oh, hi, Susan.
- Waiting?
- No, no, of course not.
I don't believe you've met my wife.
Sam, this is Susan.
- Hello.
- I'm sure you'll get to like each other.
- I'm sure.
- Won't you sit down, Susan.
- Thank you.
- Please, take my chair, Susan.
It's funny, Kermit and I were talking about you today, weren't we, Kermit?
- I'm glad to hear that.
- He said some very nice things.
Very nice.
Did you tell him about the night our car broke down near that funny roadhouse?
We walked through the rain.
You swept me up in your arms and carried me.
And I slipped.
We went splashing into that muddy water.
I'd almost forgotten.
Susan's quite a girl.
- I'll bet.
- When Darrin called me today I had misgivings as to whether I should see you.
- But now I don't.
- You two had some marvellous times.
Don't bet on that, you'd lose.
But you said Kermit carried you through the rain.
And dropped me in the mud puddle.
Oh, those rippling muscles are nothing but butterfat.
But he was doing his best.
I bet you had real fun together.
Fun?
Oh, it was terrible.
I'm glad I finally got the chance to tell you off.
Now, if you don't mind, I'd like to leave.
Don't hesitate on my account.
- Now, wait!
- For what?
I've had it with this musclebound Sir Galahad.
Don't ever call me again.
And that goes for you too.
Susan's never talked like that before.
It is strange.
She was so friendly at first.
She wouldn't have if my wife had powdered her nose instead of twitching it in people's business.
- I didn't say a word.
- You didn't have to.
- I'm looking for a Mrs. Stephens.
- Of course, right this way.
My goodness.
Look who's here.
- Gertrude!
- Kermit!
I don't know how you got here, but I'm sure glad you did.
I wanna ask you a question.
- Would you excuse us?
- Yes, of course.
- Dirty pool.
- All's fair in love and war.
Samantha, once and for all, stop interfering in Kermit's wife.
Life!
Samantha, Gertrude would like you to join her in the powder room.
- She's crying.
- What did you say to her?
- I asked her to marry me.
- Congratulations!
What are you looking so unhappy about?
- I'm the one getting married.
- I sorry I have to tell you this.
There doesn't seem to be any other way.
- Tell me.
- You're not gonna believe this.
- I believe whatever anybody tells me.
- Gertrude's a witch.
- Except that.
- I'm not kidding.
- Listen to me, Kermit.
- Look stop making insinuating remarks about Gertrude or I won't invite you to the wedding.
Sweetheart.
Wake up, or by the time we get to the wedding Gertrude will have already flown off on her broom.
Very funny.
Very funny.
Oh, dear.
It's raining.
An omen of things to come for poor Kermit.
No witch would let herself get married on a day like this.
Matter of fact, no witch would even attend a wedding on a day like this.
Good.
A union embodying such an ideal is not to be entered into lightly or unadvisedly but reverently, discreetly, advisedly, soberly and in the fear of God.
Into such a union, you come now to be joined.
If there be any here present who knows any just cause why they may not lawfully be joined in marriage I require him now to make it known or Darrin, you wouldn't say anything, would you?
- Well - They're so much in love.
And it isn't witchcraft.
You do believe me, don't you?
I believe you.
- For ever after to hold his peace.
Do you, Kermit, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife to love and to cherish, to have and to hold, and forsaking all others will you cleave to her and to her only so long as you both shall live?
- I will.
- Do you, Gertrude, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, to love and to cherish to have and to hold, and forsaking all others will you cleave to him and to him only so long as you both shall live?
- I will.
- I now declare you man and wife.
- Wasn't that a marvellous party?
- It was great.
I can't get over how much Kermit's changed.
Changed?
Yeah, it's just been a few weeks, and he's Well, I don't know.
He's acting like a Married man.
You know something, Sam?
Love can cast almost as powerful a spell on a man as witchcraft.
I'll let you in on a little professional secret: It's a lot more potent than anything we can conjure up.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Here we go again.
Honey, I'm sorry.
Couldn't you have found a safer place?
This was bound to happen again.
Well, I thought it would be all right.
Would you do me a favour?
Would you put it back together again?
I thought you didn't like me correcting mistakes that way.
I'm making an exception.
Please put it back together again.
All right.
That's fabulous.
- Would you like me to do a little magic?
- You?
Magic?
- What did you have in mind?
- Something that you'll like, I think.
Be my guest.
What do you know, it worked.
That's one you can count on.
It'll work every time.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Ouch!
Aunt Clara!
Oh, Endora was right.
I should've travelled by bus.
You all right?
You know, I think I've been putting on weight.
I used to come down through a chimney as clean as a whistle.
Come on over here and sit down.
Over here.
All right.
- Oh, yes.
- Oh, it's so nice to see you again.
Oh, and it's nice to see you too, dear.
Oh, well.
We'll have a lovely weekend together.
- Weekend?
- Doorknobs are all very well but they're not family.
- Aunt Clara.
- I count them when I'm Ionely.
But somehow, you know today, they didn't seem to do the trick.
And then I remembered the lovely invitation you gave me to come here whenever I wanted to.
I see.
Where's that nice mortal you're married to?
Darrin went to pick up his parents.
They're spending the weekend too.
Oh?
Oh, I picked a bad time for a visit.
Well, never mind, I'll leave before they arrive.
No, you won't.
Now, I haven't met Darrin's parents.
It'd be kind of nice to have you around for moral support.
Besides, we have plenty of room.
Now, you're sure I won't be in the way?
Of course not, and I'd like them to meet my favourite aunt.
Oh, you are a nice girl.
Now, why don't I show you to your room and you can get cleaned up and rest before you have to meet Darrin and his parents.
No, I think I'll wait for my bag and umbrella.
They weren't ready and packed when I wanted to go.
So I just left them there.
Teach them a lesson.
I can't wait to see him.
I hope she hasn't let him lose weight.
He can't afford to lose weight.
Oh, he's probably in the last stages of malnutrition.
You know that isn't what I meant.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, Darrin!
Oh, Darrin.
Uh-oh, here come the waterworks.
Three months away and it's like he's back from the grave.
Oh, it's too long for a son to be away from his mother, much too long.
Marriage obviously agrees with you, boy.
I've never seen you look better.
Have you, Phyllis?
Oh, he looks terrible.
How can you say he looks well?
He looks terrible.
Have you been eating the right foods, Darrin?
Oh, I feel great, Mom, honestly.
Never mind, I'll fatten you up with some good home cooking in a couple of days.
Meet my wife, the diplomat.
Now what did I say wrong?
There's our luggage.
Sam's a pretty good cook too, Mom.
- Sam?
- Samantha.
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, I'm sure she is, dear and you know I'd cut off my right arm rather than interfere.
I just thought I'd give her a few tips, though.
Can she make chicken cacciatore?
No, Mom.
No one can make chicken cacciatore the way you can.
Oh, it's nice that there's something you need your mother for.
Let's go.
I'm anxious to meet this bride of yours, Darrin.
- I bet she's something really special.
- Pop, you win your bet.
Oh, there you are.
I told you I wouldn't wait for you.
Well, don't stand there like that.
Come in, come in, come in.
Now, your room is the second on the left.
I'll check dinner and be right up.
Oh, it smells good.
Pot roast.
I wanted to serve something more exotic, but I thought I ought to stay on safe ground.
- Exotic?
Yes, you know, beef stroganoff, coq au vin something that would really impress Darrin's mother.
Don't you worry, dear.
I just know they're going to love you.
How can you be so sure?
I'm a witch.
I can't tell you how excited I was when we heard that Darrin was married.
Fainted four times.
Four!
Oh, he's exaggerating, as usual.
Oh, I will admit that I was surprised, but I'm not one of those mothers who want to keep their children tied to their apron strings.
Then why is everything in Darrin's room bronzed?
Well, there's nothing wrong with being sentimental.
I think it's rather nice.
His tennis racket?
Why don't you two men leave us alone so I can get acquainted with my daughter-in-law.
- Come on, I'll show you your room.
- Right.
You treat her well, now, Phyllis.
I like this girl.
Now we can talk.
I just wanted you to know that you don't have to worry about me being one of those interfering mother-in-laws.
Why, I'd cut off my right arm first.
Well, I wouldn't want you to do that.
Of course, if you do need any help, I'm always available.
That's nice to know.
Well, I do know a little more about Darrin's habits than you.
So if there's anything you want to know anything at all, feel free to ask.
Darrin tells me you're a good cook.
Well, I'm still learning.
Oh, good.
That is, maybe I can give you the recipes for some of his very favourite dishes.
Do you know how to make pineapple upside-down cake?
No, I don't.
Then there are his hives.
I don't know how to make those, either.
No, no, dear, that's an allergy.
It's a rash he gets.
I'll show you how to treat it.
Oh, I've cured that.
You cured his rash?
Oh, yes.
We found out he only got it when he ate chicken cacciatore.
I see.
My, this is a lovely room.
Did you?
Did you have a decorator?
No, I did it myself.
Well, it's absolutely lovely.
I bet you can't wait to get it finished.
Finished?
Oh, really all it needs is a few knickknacks to warm it up.
Darrin is used to that.
He always had them at home.
Oh, I've got more than enough.
I'll send you some when I get back.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, Darrin, I was just telling Samantha how lovely the room looks.
Yes, it does have nice, clean look.
I hate a room that's all cluttered up with ornaments.
You know, we really don't know very much about you, Samantha.
What did you do before you married Darrin?
Well, I travelled a lot.
- With your family?
- Sometimes.
Do you get to see much of your mother?
Oh, she pops in and out.
And what about the rest of your family?
Hello, Aunt Clara.
Hello, everybody.
Come on, I want you to meet everybody.
Aunt Clara, this is Mrs. Stephens and Mr. Stephens.
- How do you do?
And that is Darrin.
This is an unexpected pleasure.
You haven't met Darrin before?
Oh, well I've met him, but he hasn't met me.
In the flesh, I mean.
So to speak.
Aunt Clara is spending the weekend with us too.
She is?
I mean, she is?
Wouldn't you like to see my doorknob collection?
Why, yes, l I beg your pardon?
- Aunt Clara collects doorknobs.
- I have 3000.
- Where'd you get them all?
- I don't remember but there are a lot of people having a heck of time trying to open their doors.
Samantha, could I speak to you for a minute?
- When?
- Now.
Yes.
Excuse me.
Maybe this will be a nice chance for us to have a little chat.
Darling, I was just as surprised as you were.
I turned around and she was sitting in the fireplace.
- She came down the chimney?
Well, darling, you can't blame someone for being old.
She used to come through the wall, same as everybody else.
- Oh, great.
- She's really very sweet.
I'm sure, darling.
I'd love to have her here any other time but not this weekend.
My parents are plain, simple folks Darrin, Darrin, darling, I can't ask her to leave.
I couldn't bear to see her hurt.
You can understand that, can't you?
- I suppose so, honey.
- I know it's inconvenient but I'm sure your parents will understand.
Besides, what possible harm could she do?
Yes, I'm a witch.
All my family are.
Sort of a family thing that has been handed down, you know.
Bu the witch game is not like it used to be.
Oh, no.
Now there was a time when you could cast a spell on someone and they knew it.
Not now.
No, not now.
- Well, now, take the Yankees.
- The Yankees?
Well, they lost two World Series in a row, didn't they?
You put a spell on them.
Well, Bertha and me.
Yeah.
Bertha and you?
Oh, well, I'm so glad you don't mind.
- Mind?
- About Samantha being one.
Samantha's a witch too?
Yes, yes, but she's trying to get away from it.
Bothers Darrin.
Well, I think I'll go for a little fresh air, if you don't mind.
Shan't be long.
Why, I used to go through a wall: Just like butter.
I think I'll try the front door.
She's kind of cute, isn't she?
What about your sister Madge?
It's not the same thing at all.
Madge has a quirk, that's all.
Quirk?
She thinks she's a lighthouse.
You call standing on the garage roof when it rains to warn ships at sea a quirk?
That woman believes she's a witch.
Now you can't tell me that's normal.
Well, Darrin isn't married to Clara, and I think Samantha is a perfect wife.
Perfect?
She can't even make a pineapple upside-down cake.
What kind of a family has poor Darrin married into?
Darrin, think everything's going all right?
I don't know what you're so worried about, Pop thinks you're great.
- Yes, but what about your mother?
- I'm sure she likes you too.
Obviously the flight upset her.
She's just not herself, that's all.
Well, I don't know, I just don't know.
I've a funny feeling something's out of whack.
The only thing out of whack is your Aunt Clara.
At least you know where you stand with her.
Well, has Mom said anything?
Oh, no, of course not.
I know she's trying to be nice.
I've done everything I can to please her.
Just don't know.
I have a funny feeling, that's all.
There's something wrong.
Hello, dears.
Everything all right?
Yes, everything's ready.
Just keep your fingers crossed.
Oh, I don't believe in superstition.
I just know that everything is going to be perfect.
Oh, dear.
I better go empty the ashtrays in the living room.
Sam Clara, Clara, don't goof this up.
Coq au vin.
Go away, chickie.
Go away, chickie.
Go away, chickie.
Oh, now that's better.
Now for dessert, pineapple upside-down cake.
It's been just my luck if it came up right-side up.
I'm on a winning streak.
- Please sit down, Mr. Stephens.
- Fine.
Aunt Clara, make yourself comfortable.
Hey, that smells great.
What is it?
Pot roast.
I would like to have served you something, well, more exciting but cooking really isn't one of my That's coq au vin.
Samantha.
- That's what it is, all right.
- Oh, it looks delicious.
I thought you said you couldn't cook.
Quite a sense of humour this girl of yours has, Darrin.
Yeah, she keeps me laughing all day.
How'd you know it was my favourite?
Oh, does Mrs. Stephens cook it for you?
Cook it?
She can't even pronounce it.
You must be a great cook.
Oh, you wait until you see the dessert she's whipped up for you.
What is it, Samantha?
Maybe it should be a surprise.
Pineapple upside-down cake.
Well, Phyllis, I guess you can stop worrying now.
Our boy couldn't be in better hands.
What's the matter?
I have a sick headache.
Been at it again, haven't you?
They'll hear you.
Zap, coq au vin!
Whap, pineapple upside-down cake!
I didn't make that food.
You promised me no witchcraft.
You said you were just going to be yourself but You didn't?
Well, who did?
I would say your prime suspect is Aunt Clara unless your mother's holding out on us.
- What?
- She isn't a witch too, is she?
Let's leave my mother out of this.
No matter what you say, Darrin, it was a delicious meal and she hardly ate a mouthful.
Now, what can I do to get her to like me?
Sam, let's just solve one problem at a time.
I'll have a little talk with Aunt Clara after dinner.
Now, Darrin.
If you hurt her feelings I'll never forgive you.
She was only trying to help.
Well, I'll just ask her to stop helping.
- Be tactful.
- Don't worry.
I'll tactfully tell her that the position of house witch is already filled.
Come in.
Am I disturbing anything, Aunt Clara?
Oh, not at all, not at all.
No, I'm just polishing my doorknobs.
It must be quite a job, keeping those clean.
Well, it keeps me out of the pool halls.
That was quite a dinner you whipped up.
Oh, I still know a trick or two.
That's what I wanted to talk to you about, Aunt Clara.
You see, my mother and father, they aren't used to witchcraft.
You see that?
Now to a doorknob collector, that's equivalent to the Hope Diamond.
It's not that we don't appreciate your trying to help.
Such a nice sparkle.
Yeah, I wouldn't have even brought it up at all except that my mother and father just don't understand.
Do you understand what I'm saying, Aunt Clara?
Oh, it's nice of you to look at my doorknob collection.
Not many young people care about that sort of thing nowadays.
Come on, bag.
We must go.
Did you talk to Aunt Clara?
You didn't upset her, did you?
- She didn't seem to be upset.
- Did she understand?
It's hard to tell with Aunt Clara.
I think I better go up and see her.
I thought I'd give you a hand with the dish Oh, you've already done them.
Isn't there anything I can do?
Nothing at all, Mom.
Sam has done it all.
You should get the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, Samantha.
Thank you.
I'll be right back.
Darrin, are you happy?
What?
Of course, Mom.
Now, if there is anything you want to tell me about, I'm always here.
I've never been happier in my life.
Any problem at all, no matter how large or how small.
Just because you're married doesn't mean you can't come to your mother.
Mom, I don't have any problems.
Well, that's all right.
If you don't want to tell me about it, that's fine with me, - I'd cut off my right arm - Phyllis, leave the boy alone.
Now, hasn't a mother the right to ask if her son is happy?
Who wouldn't be happy married to a dream like Samantha?
She's a lovely girl, all right.
Why've you been trying to find fault with her ever since we arrived?
- That's not true.
- I mean, what do you want?
She's beautiful, she's talented she's even-tempered and she's a great cook.
- I agree.
- Then there's no argument.
- Then there's no argument.
- All right!
If there's no argument, why are you yelling at each other?
- What'd you do to Aunt Clara?
- I didn't do anything.
You must've said something insulting, or she wouldn't have left.
- Sam, do we have to?
- Darrin, you promised to be tactful.
- Must we discuss this in front of them?
- Yes.
Aunt Clara is a guest in this house too.
You may not like it, but she's my family.
Really, Samantha.
There's no need to take it out on Darrin.
- Shut up, Phyllis.
I told you it's not my fault she left.
Yes, it is.
If you hadn't been annoyed Aunt Clara made the dinner none of this would've happened.
She cooked dinner?
Yes, she did.
You may as well know it right now, I'm not a very good cook.
You're not?
No, I'm not.
I can't make coq au vin or pineapple upside-down cake or any of those fancy dishes.
- Samantha.
- It's no use, Darrin.
I cannot pretend to be something I'm not.
And I won't stand here and see Aunt Clara hurt.
I don't blame you.
What did you say to that nice old lady?
- I didn't say any - You be quiet.
- Go on, dear.
- Well, that's just about it.
I wanted you to think I was the perfect wife for Darrin, and Aunt Clara thought she was helping me.
The fact is, I'm not very good at housekeeping yet.
If you like me any less for that, I'm sorry but you just have to accept me as I am, faults and all.
Samantha, you don't know how happy you've made me.
What are you crying about?
What do you men know about anything?
What's going on here?
I didn't want you to be perfect, dear.
Well then, why did you act as if you did?
Because I'm a silly old woman who was afraid she'd be pushed aside and forgotten.
And you seem so self-sufficient and so good at everything.
I just thought I wouldn't be needed anymore.
Do you understand?
Yes, I do.
- I'll go find Aunt Clara.
- She's at the bus station.
- How do you know?
- I asked her umbrella.
Good thinking, I'll be back in a few minutes.
Well, I hope he finds her.
You asked her what?
Oh, a family joke.
I just have a hunch she's there.
Maybe Aunt Clara is right.
You are a witch after all.
I am.
But don't spread it around.
It'll be our secret.
Oh, Darrin.
You don't really think that I bronzed your tennis racket, do you?
Of course not, Mom, I knew Pop was kidding.
However, I did bronze your shoes.
Your football shoes.
We're using them for bookends.
- Would you girls like a little magic?
- Frank, for heaven's sake.
We'll show you a little trick here.
Aunt Clara, take a card out of the deck.
Just any card, go on.
Take it out and then look at it, put it back in.
Don't let me see it now.
Let me see.
All right.
- You got it.
- Yep.
Put it back in, now.
Anywhere, just anywhere.
Right.
Alrighty now, let's see.
Your card is the It's funny.
It's always worked before.
You'll find it in your topcoat pocket.
Now, how did you do that?
I'm a witch.
Oh, well, now, I think I'll go for my little constitutional.
You mind if we walk along with you?
Walk?
Well, that might be nice for a change.
You know, the next time we come I must bring my sister Madge along.
She and Clara would have a ball, wouldn't they, Frank?
Oh, dear.
They really seem to have hit it off, haven't they?
They sure have.
And they think you're the greatest.
That's nice.
Well, it's as I said.
All you had to be was yourself.
You're right, darling.
Samantha.
You said I should be myself.
I take it all back.
Maybe my folks aren't ready for the real you yet.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Darrin?
- I'm right here, sweetheart.
- Oh, hi there.
I'll be dressed in a minute.
We're due at the orphanage in half an hour.
- Did you get the tree?
- Oh, yes.
Yes, I got it.
- How much was it?
- Eighteen dollars.
And they wanted 5 dollars extra, delivery charge.
Must be pretty big.
It was pretty big all right, but I got it home.
Good, honey.
I'll be down in a few minutes to take it out of the car.
Oh, no.
No, Darrin, don't bother.
I can manage.
Five dollars delivery charge.
Good.
Hurry up, Abner.
What's the rush, Gladys?
The kid isn't running away.
- Abner.
- All right, I'm coming, Gladys.
Oh, I'm just excited, Abner.
After all, I've never been a mother before.
- Don't be getting any ideas.
- What do you mean?
We're taking a kid home to spend Christmas with us.
Christmas, that's all.
Understand?
Will you please try and keep an open mind, Abner?
It's open, but it's also made up.
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.
- We're Mr. And Mrs. Kravitz.
- Oh, how do you do?
I'm Mrs. Grange, the director.
Now, let's see.
You came for a A boy.
A Tommy Becker.
That's right.
Yes, of course.
Which one is he?
Well, he was standing around the tree a minute ago.
There he is.
The sandy-haired boy in the striped sweater.
Would you like me to introduce you?
Oh, no.
That's all right.
- We'll just go over and say hello.
- Fine.
Let me know when you're ready to leave.
Thank you, Mrs. Grange.
Oh, no.
It's we who thank you, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Hello, Tommy.
- Hello.
What would you like Santa Claus to bring you for Christmas?
- I don't need anything.
- Sounds like a nice boy.
Tommy, you're gonna come home and spend Christmas with us.
Would you like that?
That's wonderful.
Now, you stay right here, and we'll tell Mrs. Grange that we're ready to leave.
Do you suppose Santa is coming to your house on Christmas?
He'll be there.
The 15th of every month after that.
What do you want, Michael?
You let my Santa Claus alone.
- You still believe in that kid's stuff?
- It's not kid's stuff.
Oh, yeah?
What's Santa Claus gonna bring you?
- Lots of things, that's what.
- I bet you get nothing.
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah, I wanna bet.
I think that's everything.
You just sign this one, but Oh, dear!
Boys!
Tommy, Michael!
Stop this at once.
Stop it, I say.
Now get up, boys.
Tommy, Michael, I'm ashamed of both of you.
Well, he said Christmas was a lot of bunk.
Oh, you're gonna have a black eye.
Come on, Tommy, we'll get you a steak for that.
Now what's the matter with cold cuts?
Michael, some very nice people have come to take you home for the holidays.
This is Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
- Hello, Michael.
- Hi.
Hello.
Oh, my.
- Here.
- Thank you.
You're welcome.
Perhaps we better complete the arrangements.
Yes, why don't you.
Darrin, Michael and I will wait for you here.
- Fine.
- Would you come to my desk?
All right.
See you later.
Well, what was the fight all about?
I didn't start it.
Self defence, huh?
I won't tell anybody.
Well, just because I busted his little old Santa Claus he punched me in the nose.
Why did you do that?
You must have had a reason.
- He called me a liar.
- Well, that wasn't very nice.
It sure wasn't.
Were you?
Lying, I mean?
Of course not.
Christmas is a lot of bunk and so is Santa Claus.
You don't really believe that?
Sure I do.
Don't you?
- Not me, I know better.
- Baloney.
You better be careful or you're apt to get another punch in the nose.
Now that they've had a chance to talk, he's coming to warn you.
He's gonna say, " Don't waste your time with Michael because he's a problem child".
- Are you?
Honey, may I speak to you for a minute?
Mrs. Grange tells me that Michael's been a problem around here.
He's a troubled child if you know what I mean.
- Yes, I can see that.
- No, it's serious, Sam.
A couple adopted him.
Twice they had to bring him back.
Mrs. Grange is of the opinion that he's not a child who would enjoy or appreciate spending Christmas with us.
I'm sure that Mrs. Grange means well.
But I think that Michael is exactly the sort of child that has to spend Christmas away from here with people like us.
- Well, Sam - Please, Darrin.
Okay.
I just hope he knows the meaning of: "Peace on Earth, goodwill towards men".
How'd you make out?
I can't reach him.
Christmas doesn't mean a thing to him.
He is the youngest Scrooge I've ever seen.
Maybe when he sees Santa Claus it'll touch off a spark somewhere.
- I don't know.
- Oh, let's not give up yet.
Whatever it is that disillusioned him, we can't make it up to him in 5 minutes.
Okay.
You take over.
I'll go practice my, "Ho, ho, ho".
"And because of his tiny stature they called him Tom Thumb.
They let him want for nothing, yet the child grew no bigger but remained the same size as when he was born".
"Still he looked out on the world with intelligent eyes and soon showed himself a clever and agile" Oh, I'm sorry, Michael.
I didn't know you were asleep.
That's okay.
Maybe we better stop now, huh?
What was that?
- What?
- Did you hear a noise on the roof?
That's funny, I could've sworn There it is again.
It's coming from downstairs now.
Didn't you hear it?
Yeah, just then I did.
It's probably Mr. Stephens.
Mr. Stephens had to go to the village.
He won't be back for a while.
Michael, there's someone downstairs.
- Yeah?
Who?
- I don't know.
I can't tell.
- Would you mind coming with me?
- Okay.
- Put your slippers on.
- Okay.
Be very, very quiet.
Michael, look.
Well, what do you think of Santa Claus now?
Well, by my beard, I've been caught.
Here I thought me and my reindeer were as quiet as mice.
Well, no matter.
Merry Christmas, Mrs. Stephens.
Merry Christmas, Michael.
Same to you, Mr. Stephens.
Who?
Well, what do you mean?
I'm Santa Claus.
Don't you know me?
Where are you going?
Don't you wanna see what Santa brought you, son?
I don't care what you've brought me, and I'm not your son.
Well, that about does it.
Don't be angry, sweetheart.
I've got as much Christmas spirit as the next fellow.
But there's a limit to what even Santa Claus can take.
- I'm going to talk to him.
- I wanna wish you good luck.
I'll need it.
Michael.
Michael, I thought we were going to be friends.
You don't have to treat me like a kid.
- What do you mean?
- I told you, there ain't no Santa Claus.
- Why do you say that?
- Because I know.
How do you know?
Santa Claus is a kid's father stuffed with pillows like Mr. Stephens, like in a department store like my father used to be.
And all the kids used to ask him for things.
He used to tell me money didn't grow on trees and how there aren't any real Santa Clauses.
They were all kid's fathers stuffed with pillows.
Michael, suppose I were to tell you that it really isn't exactly that way.
Suppose I were to tell you that there really is a Santa Claus.
And I know because I've talked to him.
Suppose I were to tell you that.
What would you say?
I'd say, "Prove it".
- I can.
- How?
- I can take you to the North Pole to see.
- The North Pole?
Like that, practically.
No one can do that.
A witch can.
So I can.
Because I am a witch.
I don't believe you.
I suppose you want me to prove it.
Well, all right.
You ready?
How's that?
But where's your pointed hat?
Pointed hat?
Okay.
That's pretty good.
But where's your broom?
Broom, huh?
- Can you ride it?
- Of course.
- With me too?
- Lf you like.
Michael, how would you like to take that little trip right now?
- You mean now?
- Now.
Here, you better put this on.
It's apt to be a little chilly.
And don't forget your feet.
- Now, you can - What's going on?
Excuse me, Michael.
- What are you doing?
- Darling Christmas Eve is almost over and we haven't gotten anywhere with him.
I can't take him back tomorrow as unhappy and disillusioned as he was when he came.
- What are you gonna do?
- Take him to see Santa Claus.
- Another one?
- The real one.
The real?
Are you telling?
Are you trying to tell me there really is a?
- Of course there is, darling.
- Where?
I mean, where?
Where?
- Where does?
- Where does he live?
Yeah.
The North Pole.
Oh, come on, Sam.
Well, it's true.
- Why don't you come with us?
- You're kidding.
No, I'm serious.
Me?
Go to the North Pole to see Santa Claus?
Why not?
It's Christmas.
All right.
By the time Santa gets here this tree will be loaded.
Are you sure he's gonna come?
- I told you, he'll be here.
- Oh, sure.
Now, I'm gonna do the dishes.
By the time I'm finished it'll be time for you to go to bed.
Okay, Tommy?
Abner!
Abner, look!
- Look where?
- In the sky.
Three of them.
Two big ones and a little one.
Did you see them, Abner?
- Oh, sure I did.
- Did you?
Did you really?
- I sure did.
- Did you see all three of them?
Certainly.
There was Donder, Blitzen and Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer.
- What are you talking about, Abner?
- I saw them as plain as day.
- I didn't see no Donder and Blitzen.
- So it was Dancer and Prancer.
What's the difference?
They're probably looking for the house now.
Why don't we sing so they can fly in on the beam?
Sing, Gladys, sing.
Sleigh, Gladys.
Sleigh.
Here we are.
- Where?
Where?
- The North Pole.
- Really?
- Certainly.
And that's where Santa lives.
Who's out there?
Excuse me, but is Mr. Claus very busy?
Of course he's very busy.
What do you think this is?
The Fourth of July?
We won't keep him long.
Will you just tell him Samantha's here?
- Samantha who?
- Just tell him Samantha.
He'll know.
All right, but I'm not promising anything.
Do you suppose he'll see us?
Oh, I'm sure of it.
Have you known him long?
Oh, yes.
A long time.
He'll be right out.
Make yourselves at home.
Samantha.
Samantha, what a pleasant surprise.
How are you, my dear?
- Just fine, Santa, and you?
- Oh, just the same.
Always the same.
Oh, excuse me.
Santa, this is my husband, Darrin.
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Santa?
- And this is Michael.
- I'm pleased to meet you, Michael.
Won't you sit down?
Come on, Michael.
Sit over here.
I'm sorry I haven't much time to chat with you.
I can at least offer you a cup of tea or a glass of milk.
- Michael?
- No, thank you, Santa.
- Dennis?
- Darrin, Santa.
- Oh, yes.
Yes, of course.
- No, thank you.
Nothing for me, Santa.
Well, it It must be something very important that brought you all the way here.
What's the problem?
I think the problem's been solved by just being here.
Those aren't pillows, are they?
No, my boy.
Sometimes I wish they were.
I've tried all kinds of diet, but nothing works.
But then again, if I got too thin, my children might not recognise me.
I'd know you.
Yes, l I think you would.
But what difference does it make how we look on the outside, eh?
It's what we feel on the inside that counts, isn't it?
We all grow older and our eyes get weaker but what we've seen with our hearts remains forever a thing of joy and beauty.
Do you agree with that, sir?
- Yes, I do, Santa.
- Good.
Now, I must be going.
I've talked long enough.
But before I go, I want you to tell me what you'd like for Christmas.
I don't know.
I guess I haven't thought much about it.
Well, then, take your time.
Just take a little look around the display tables.
Pick out something nice for yourself.
Or maybe for someone else.
Remember, Michael the real happiness of Christmas isn't found in what we get but what we give.
Darrin.
- Sweetheart, wake up.
Wake up.
- What?
Michael's asleep.
I think you better take him upstairs to bed.
You know, I had the strangest dream.
He was in it and so were you.
We all went to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.
How about that?
- Sounds like fun.
- It was.
Honey, turn the heat up, will you?
Feels like snow.
I'm not gonna start nothing, Tommy.
- What did you come over here for?
- I got a present for you.
I didn't get nothing for you, Michael.
That's okay.
Why don't you try it.
Gee, Michael, it's keen.
Where did you get it?
Promise not to tell?
Cross your heart?
Last night we went to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.
- Mr. And Mrs. Stephens and me.
- You did?
- How?
- Mrs. Stephens' broom.
- Abner!
- What's the matter, Gladys?
- I want you to come with me.
- For what?
The little boy from the Stephens' house is here.
He's talking with Tommy.
So?
Well, I just want you to hear what they're saying.
Come on.
- Where did he go?
- Michael?
He had to go home.
Well, now would you tell Mr. Kravitz what he said about where he went last night?
- Where?
- You know with Mr. And Mrs. Stephens on her broom.
He didn't say anything like that, Mrs. Kravitz.
But I heard you talking.
I was at the window and I heard you talking about going to the North Pole to see Santa Claus.
Wait a minute, Abner.
Tommy, please tell Mr. Kravitz about the North Pole.
- Gladys.
- Wait a minute, Abner.
Abner.
Abner, wait now.
Please try to remember, Tommy.
Tommy, try to remember.
I know.
Abner, wait.
The broom.
The broom.
The broom, Tommy.
He didn't say anything like that, Mrs. Kravitz.
Gee, Mrs. Kravitz when a fella crosses his heart what can a fella do?
Take off.
- Turn.
- Watch, watch, watch.
Oh, never mind.
I'll get it.
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Stephens.
- Merry Christmas, Mrs. Grange.
- Won't you come in?
- Thank you so much.
May I present Mr. And Mrs. Johnson.
This is the couple who's been interested in Michael.
- I see.
How do you do?
- Hello.
How do you do?
We have a gift for Michael.
We hoped you wouldn't mind.
Of course not.
Let's all go in the living room.
- Hello, Mrs. Grange.
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Stephens.
Merry Christmas, Michael.
This is my husband.
This is Mr. And Mrs. Johnson.
- Hello.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
- And Merry Christmas to you, Michael.
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome.
I've got a present for you too.
I hope you'll like it.
I brought it all the way from From town.
It's a toolbox.
It's got a hammer and a saw and a drill.
I bet if we could find wood, we could build a whole lot of great things.
Would you really like to try it?
I must've caught a cold somewhere last night.
- Well, come on.
Let's open it.
- You think we can open it right now?
Goodbye, Michael.
Thank you for spending Christmas with us.
Thank you, Mr. Stephens.
Goodbye, Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye, Michael.
You come back and visit us, huh?
We'll certainly see to that, Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye.
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.
What was that?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Samantha Stephens, entertainment chairman?
Why pull a dirty trick like this on an innocent young bride like her?
Only an innocent young bride like her would fall for a dirty trick like this.
Besides, it's for a worthy project, isn't it?
You don't have to sell the hospital-relief fund to us.
Don't forget, we stuck you with entertainment chairman last year.
Believe me, it was a lot tougher hiring professional talent with the kind of budget I had.
This year the committee has set aside 50 dollars.
Samantha, over here.
I'm sorry I'm late, but on the way across town, I saw the cutest hat.
That's all right, we haven't ordered yet.
- What hat?
- It didn't do a thing for me but don't you love the purse and shoes that went with it?
You're the best-dressed chairman our hospital fund ever had.
Me, chairman?
- Congratulations.
- You'll do a great job.
Thank you.
It's a great honour.
I'll do my best.
Waiter.
Garçon.
Somebody.
Why do we eat here?
You can never get a waiter.
- Did you see that?
- I certainly did.
It was almost like magic.
- Keep the change.
- Thank you.
- They really did it to you?
- I don't mind buying lunch.
No, no, not that, entertainment chairman.
They stick the new ones with the tough jobs.
PTA Friends of the Library, The Garden Club, The Bird Watchers.
Any group of women that gets together to do something, sooner or later does it at one of my tables.
- You seem to know a lot about women.
When they're in groups.
How much did they allow you to spend on entertainment?
Fifty bucks?
- How did you?
- I'm an eavesdropper.
And that's lucky for you, I happen to have a friend Who'd be willing to do what for my 50 dollars?
- Magic.
He's a magician.
- Is he any good?
Good?
He's better than good.
He's adequate.
Well, 50 dollars, I can't expect to get Harry Houdini, can I?
- What's his phone number?
- Oh, he hasn't got a phone but here's his address.
- Goodbye, buster.
- Roxie, wait.
I've done enough waiting, I'm leaving.
And when you sober up don't come crawling back, because Roxie's had it up to here.
- Out of my way, sister.
- I'm looking for The Great Zeno.
You found him, and you can have him.
- Mr. Zeno?
- Come in.
Come in.
- Mr. Zeno - Not "mister," just Zeno.
The Great Zeno.
- Norman, the waiter, sent me.
- Correction.
Norman, the guardian angel of fools and tired vaudeville acts.
Welcome to my home such as it is.
Won't you sit down, Miss?
- Mrs. Stephens.
- How you do?
How do you do?
Norman said that you'd entertain at our hospital benefit for $50.
Good old Norman.
You know, between the two of us I'd have done it for $30.
I'm sorry that you had to come all the way down but ever since they took the phone, I don't know, for some reason Well, I understand.
Here, 50 dollars.
Is it a deal?
It's a deal.
Shall we seal it with a nip?
I'll fix you a drink.
No, no, thank you.
I've just finished lunch.
This is my lunch.
And for dessert What are we celebrating, Johnny Appleseed's birthday?
No, the end of a beautiful friendship.
My associate, Ms. Roxie Ames she's decided to take her talents elsewhere.
Lovely girl.
It's really not her fault.
You see, I have this problem.
- Oh, I hadn't noticed.
- I don't mean this, no.
This is just something that I do between engagements.
My last real engagement was Hartford, four years ago.
That's my problem.
That was your problem.
You have a job now.
You know I won't kid you that I don't need the money.
What I really need is to get out there in front of an audience.
I'll surprise you.
I used to be good before I had this run of bad luck.
- I'm sorry.
- No, save your pity.
I can still Well, these things are old.
They're like rags.
But here's one.
Here's one that the kids just love.
They break an awful lot of glasses at home trying it till they get it, but Wait a minute, I guess I hit that just a little too hard.
Here.
Let me try it again.
See?
But I do better stuff than that.
I'm sure you do, and the job's yours.
- Well - But you've got to promise no more.
I'll drink to that one.
- Something the matter?
- Either I'm tighter than I think I am or I've got the D.T.'s.
Oh, boy.
I don't know about you, buster, but I need a drink.
- First time anyone's called me "buster".
- Oh, I didn't mean you.
I meant Is he still here?
He's gone.
- What's the matter, you seeing things?
- I sure am.
Sister Stephens I've finally seen the light.
Hallelujah.
Mrs. Kravitz, have you seen my wife lately?
- Kiss me for a dollar, and I'll tell you.
- Only a dollar?
Come on, be a sport.
Chalk it up to charity.
They only let me in the kissing booth on coffee breaks.
Okay.
Well?
Well How did?
I thought you were on the entertainment committee.
Wasn't that entertaining?
Like to try for two?
Mr. Stephens, if you don't wanna buy any more kisses would you step aside for those of us who do?
Certainly, Dr. Clarke, I regret that I've but one wife to give to your hospital.
Thank you, dearie, I'll take over from here.
Certainly.
Gentlemen, this booth does not give refunds.
Mr. Zeno, may I come in?
- Please go away.
- It's Samantha Stephens your friendly neighbourhood chairman.
Come in.
Hi, you ready?
I kept hoping she'd show up.
She did the last time.
Maybe it was the time before that.
I don't know.
You're the magician.
You don't need anybody.
Roxie dresses up the act, and I do need her.
Anybody who'd wear a costume like that wouldn't dress up the act she'd steal it from you.
- That's the gimmick.
While they're watching her, they're not paying much attention to what I do.
You see, I'm a pretty rotten magician.
Nonsense, I bet your act is just as good without her.
- You don't know much about magic.
- I do.
It's sort of a hobby with our family.
Hey, that's pretty good.
How did you do that?
Even we amateurs know better than to tell the tricks of the trade.
Look, I can't go out there alone.
Would you take Roxie's place and help me?
In that costume?
I couldn't.
Well, that's that, then.
Here's what's left of the 50 you gave me.
- I'll pay you the rest as soon as I get it.
- Wait.
What for?
You mean you won't go on if I don't go out there with you?
I'm sorry.
Welcome, friends of the New North Hospital.
Thanks to our entertainment chairman, Mrs. Darrin Stephens we have a special magic act tonight that is full of surprises.
Ladies and gentlemen, The Great Zeno.
Ruth.
The curtain, Ruth.
Ruth!
Samantha.
Beautiful lady deserves beautiful flowers.
Next, a vase.
Or is it vase?
And here it is.
And here it was.
- And no applause.
I told you I'd flop.
- Do the next trick.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to take this rope and cut it in half with this pair of scissors.
- No, no, that's wrong.
- Go ahead.
Go ahead.
And bring the two separate pieces back together again by magic.
- One piece of rope.
- Very good.
Did you see that?
All of a sudden he's good.
- And she gave him a funny look.
- You should look so funny.
What would a magic act be without the old rabbit-from-the-hat trick.
A few passes of the magic wand and - Did you see that?
- What?
- You never saw rabbits jumping before?
- Backward?
Mrs. Stephens really did it this time.
I mean, she certainly found us a clever act.
The fact remains that my magician was so good, the girls want me to handle the show next year.
- The fact is you did Zeno's magic act for him last night, didn't you?
- Not all of it.
I just helped him because he was so scared.
He's such a sweet little man, and I couldn't stand to see him fail.
- To us it's just a show, but to him - I know, sweetheart.
I'm very proud of you.
I just wish you hadn't had to reach back into your old bag of tricks, that's all.
Hello.
Oh, Zeno.
Good for you.
Zeno's got a job, a real one.
On television?
He's a last-minute substitute on Variety Showcase.
Oh, I couldn't.
Zeno, you'll do very well without me.
That's right, gotta push them out of the nest, let them fly on their own.
Hold on a minute.
You're absolutely right.
Zeno has to learn how to fly under his own power.
Good girl.
I've got an important meeting tonight with clients so I'll be home late.
- I understand.
Hello.
You still there?
What's that I hear in the background?
Do I hear glasses clinking?
Zeno, I thought you'd given up bars.
Oh, I can't, I promised my husband.
Zeno, don't cry.
All right.
All right, I'll come to your rehearsal.
Yes, bye.
I've watched the Stephens' house for an hour now, and she's not up to anything.
Never is, it's all in your imagination.
Say, I saw it advertised on television.
That little magician will be on Variety Showcase tonight.
- You see?
- No, I don't see.
- She got him on television.
You'll see.
No, I won't, he's on opposite the basketball game.
She must have arranged it.
I bet if you went down to the television studio right now you'd find Mrs. Stephens, and she'd be up to something.
Hi, Mr. Zeno.
How is everything going?
Never better.
A guy was here telling me how crazy they are about the act.
- I knew you could do it.
- Sure, after all, it's no different from the hospital benefit.
- That's the spirit.
Who am I kidding?
"The Great Zeno".
I was never great.
The other night, I still can't figure out how I pulled it off.
It must have been having you out there smiling that gave me confidence.
It was a fluke, a once-in-a-lifetime.
- I'll never get through it.
- Of course you will.
You just have to believe in yourself.
- Will you stay for the show?
- Yes.
You know, win or lose, I'd like you to know something: You're a very nice lady.
Good luck.
Thanks.
All right, wise guy, where's your mysterious Mrs. Stephens.
She's got to be here.
She wasn't home.
Well, that makes sense.
Take it, Carol.
Zeno, baby!
I came just as soon as I heard the good news.
You must be getting a bundle.
- You don't seem too happy to see me.
- Of course I am, Roxie.
- It's just that we're on the air.
- I know.
Don't you worry, doll.
When Roxie gets out there and gives out with the old personality, we'll come on strong.
- Where's my dressing room?
- I think I remembered every - Roxie.
- What's this little character do?
- Roxie, she's a friend of mine.
- Friend?
- Well, that's a new word for it.
- Roxie.
After all the years I carried you in this stale act when you finally luck into a decent booking, you brush Roxie for her.
What's going on here?
Hold it down, we're on the air.
You don't need anyone but me.
Tell her.
- Never mind, Zeno, I'll leave.
- No, no, I want you to stay.
- I want her to go.
- Look, Roxie, we're on in a minute.
Please, go get your costume.
That's a girl.
You said everything would be all right, all along.
It will be.
I don't understand it.
Samantha has gotta be around here somewhere.
What do you think, the magician is gonna pull her out of his hat?
On this next trick, tell them to keep the camera on me, alone.
I'm doing the most important stuff until I hand the tray then go to your two-shot.
- Boy, this dame is murder.
- She is sure of herself.
She's hogging the whole bit.
Why doesn't Zeno stop her?
Watch it, stupid, you're getting it all over me.
Sorry.
The old guy's a little rusty, but don't worry, I know how to cover for him.
Roxie, you're killing me, why?
Because this is little Roxie's big chance, you jerk.
I'm out to get a regular spot as the Variety Showcase girl.
And now, ladies and gentlemen Oh, boy, this is brutal.
I watched the run-through, he would've been better off without her.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Give me that.
See that.
See, she's here.
What do you say to that?
I say you made me lose the basketball game.
Get off the stage, sister or 40 million people will see how you look with no teeth.
My assistant will place her hand into the empty fish bowl and draw out a surprise.
- I can't get my hand out.
- Don't worry, I'll cover for you.
And now We caught a big one, didn't we?
Well, while we're waiting for the surprise ladies and gentlemen, I have here This is even better than the basketball game.
How about that, folks, a magician and a comedy act both for the price of one.
- Can't tell me that was just an accident.
Who cares, it's the first good trick in the act.
You did that on purpose.
Bring her back.
Bring her back.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, what would a magic act be without the egg-in-the-hat trick.
An ordinary hat and an ordinary hen egg.
Observe the ordinary hen egg and an ordinary table knife.
Take the magic wand, stir gently, and See how it's grown.
Come on, let's hear it for The Great Zeno.
- Do you hear that?
They love you.
- What happened to Roxie?
She'll be back.
This is your big moment.
Go out there and make the most of it.
- Wait, where are you going?
I'm giving up show business.
You don't need me you don't need anybody.
You're good.
- He is good.
- Darrin.
Good for the next 13 weeks.
- Who told you so?
- My client, the sponsor.
- Your client?
You got Zeno this job?
- We did.
- What happened to your meeting?
- I knew you couldn't stay out of this.
Darrin, that's not fair.
I just came down to wish Zeno good luck.
Come on, I've been watching you from the sponsors' booth.
- You have?
- Yes, I have.
From now on, the only one who'll be doing any magic is the magician.
I'm here to see that you keep your nose out of his business.
Now today's newspaper, we place it on top and turn it over.
Rub a little.
- Samantha.
- I can't help it, I have to sneeze.
The power of the press.
Either we've been hypnotized, or we're out of our minds.
Don't talk plural, I'm hypnotized.
You're out of your mind.
Darrin.
Darrin, I'm sleepy.
Why don't you go to bed.
I'll be along just as soon as I get this trick.
I think I'm getting the hang of it.
I guess I'll go to bed.
Sam.
Sam, I did it!
I did it!
- At least, I think I did.
- Darrin.
Up here, sweetheart.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Sam?
I think I forgot to lock the back door.
- I'll do it.
- No, I'll do it.
- Oh, no, sweetheart, you're too tired.
- Well, so are you.
I'll do it from here.
No, no, never mind.
No hocus-pocus, I'll do it.
All right, darling.
Darrin!
Darrin.
- Darrin.
Oh, Darrin.
- I think I sprained my ankle.
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.
- Don't apologize, it's not your fault.
- It is my fault.
I just remembered I already locked the back door.
Beautiful.
Samantha!
Oh, not again.
Please let it be my imagination.
Samantha!
It isn't.
Yes, darling, I hear you.
What do you want?
- A pencil.
- A pencil.
Pencil.
Cigarettes, lighter, magazines.
- Pencil.
- Oh, thank you.
I'm sorry I had to bother you again.
How many trips does this make, 15?
Twenty-seven.
But who counts?
"Whoever finds this, I love you.
Please bring me another pencil".
Oh, Darrin.
Thank you.
A, N Samantha!
- Did you call me?
- I did.
Sit down.
I wanna talk to you.
- When?
- Now.
Darrin, before you get angry, please be fair.
You sailed something down to me, right?
It was only fair that I sail a little something back up to you.
What I did was not only extremely clever and humorous it was aerodynamically sound.
What you did was witchcraft, premeditated and uncalled for merely to irritate me.
Well, when you put it that way, I do feel terribly guilty but I was just too tired to dash up the stairs again.
I have been running you ragged, haven't I?
- No.
I only limp when I hurry.
- Maybe we should hire a nurse.
- What for?
- Not a very pretty nurse, of course.
- You don't need a nurse.
- Oh, not for me, for you.
I don't need a nurse either.
All I need is a little help to - Darrin, I have an idea.
- What sort of an idea?
An idea of how to solve the servant problem around here.
What are you talking about?
What if I were downstairs and you wanted a glass of water?
- Yeah?
- Go ahead, ask for it.
I've told you 100 times, I don't want any of that nonsense.
You'd rather I ran up and down stairs all day?
- No, of course not.
- Then, Darrin let me have the house cooperate with you.
- Cooperate?
- Please, darling?
It would be so much easier.
- Well, what am I supposed to do?
- Ask for something.
- Anything at all?
- Anything we've got.
Do we have any bananas?
All right.
- Banana, come.
Darrin.
- You don't have to sound like Tarzan.
Well, I never talked to a banana before.
Well, some of us got it, some of us ain't.
Something's out of whack.
I'll go see.
- Mother.
- Hello, darling.
That's Darrin's banana.
How was I to know?
It was just floating by.
- It was on its way upstairs.
- Upstairs?
- Whatever are you talking about?
- Oh, just a minute.
- No, no, no.
Upstairs, hurry.
- What is this all about?
- Darrin called for it, you intercepted.
- He called for it?
- Don't tell me he's a convert.
- No, of course not.
I arranged for the house to cooperate with him while he's recuperating.
Excuse me.
Well, well, well.
It's Adam and the apple all over again.
Window, open.
Window, close.
Drapes, close.
Drapes, open.
Window, halfway open.
Lunch.
I'd like a baked ham and Swiss cheese sandwich on wheat bread double order of potato salad, sweet pickles, hold the mustard.
Samantha, when you make a mistake, you do make a lulu.
- What mistake?
- Oh, you just wait, you'll see.
You see?
There, now, it's started.
Mother, I've been running up and down stairs all day.
- Darrin's doing that to help me.
- Oh, yes.
Don't you realize, Samantha, you've given him the proverbial inch?
Opened up the forbidden can of peas, poked the hole in the dike.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- You've given him a taste of power.
Now he'll want more and more and more.
- Not Darrin.
- Oh, if he's mortal, he's greedy.
He's not greedy.
He's hungry.
He's hungry-greedy.
Just a minute.
Today lunch, tomorrow the world.
- Hi, darling.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- How are you feeling?
- Marvellous.
I've never had more fun in my life.
How about you?
Exhausted.
But I finished everything.
This is the last of the ironing.
Good.
Book, back to the living room.
And remember my place.
- Sit down, sweetheart.
- Oh, I'll be back as soon as I put the towels away.
- Never mind that.
Towels, put yourselves away.
That's pretty good, huh?
Sit down, darling, I wanna talk to you.
You know, I have been thinking, and I have come to a conclusion.
I've been selfish, stupid and unreasonable and I wanna ask your forgiveness.
- I don't know what you're talking about.
Well, when we were married, you tried to fit your way into my scheme of life.
- I love you.
I want you to be happy.
- But what did I want?
I wanted you to give up everything natural to you.
I said, "No more witchcraft, give it up".
Isn't that what I said?
Yes, but I understand.
That's because you kept an open mind.
But not me.
No, my mind was closed, just like a clam shell.
But that's all over.
Cigarette, please.
- Over?
- Yes.
From now on, you use that power whenever and wherever you want to.
Light, please.
- Darrin, you don't really mean that.
- I most certainly do.
Why have I said to you, " No witchcraft.
Don't help me, don't help yourself"?
Why?
I ask you, why?
Well, I'll tell you why.
It was ego.
If I couldn't do it, I didn't want you to.
If I couldn't give something to you, I didn't want you to have it.
Ego, pure ego.
Simple as that.
Darling, that's not ego, that's the way it should be.
- Not if you have to suffer for it.
- I'm not suffering.
- You don't have a fur coat.
- Lots of women don't have fur coats.
- Louise Tate has a fur coat.
- She can afford it.
We can't.
- You mean I can't.
- I'd just as soon wait until you could.
That's just my ego talking again, Sam.
Will you please stop being so considerate of my inconsiderateness.
I guess Mother was right.
Really?
Hi, Mom.
Oh, how are you, dear boy?
You were saying?
Well, I do understand.
Mothers want the best for their daughters.
Nothing unusual about that.
You're being quite sensible about the whole situation.
There you are.
I can see that.
After all, isn't that what you always wanted?
- Harmony in the family?
- Of course.
All right.
If that's the way it has to be.
What sort of a fur coat would you like me to have?
One that's every bit as nice as the one Louise wears, because you deserve it.
- You look positively beautiful, Sam.
- Doesn't she, though.
- Thank you.
- Doesn't she have marvellous taste?
- Darrin, isn't it?
- That's right.
- What else do you need, Sam?
- Darrin I don't need anything.
- Of course you do.
- I want you to have everything.
- I don't want everything.
- Oh, yes, you do.
- Now, now, children, don't quarrel.
I think it's very touching, seeing young people exchanging tokens of each other's affection.
Forget about that.
I don't want a thing.
Mother, will you stop provoking and please leave.
Sam, don't talk that way to your mother.
I don't want a thing.
Except Now, I think I must be flying along.
Good night, all.
See you soon.
A yo-yo.
- A what?
- A whistling yo-yo.
When I was a kid, I wanted a whistling yo-yo more than anything.
And a pocket-knife with eight blades.
Never got one of those either.
Or a.22 calibre rifle.
I always did want one of those.
And a double-breasted suit and a cashmere coat and a great big Well, why not, Sam?
Why not?
I can't believe it.
I just can't believe it.
It doesn't make any sense, Darrin.
You're too young to retire.
Larry, I've thought about it very carefully.
Now, look, Darrin, I know that pain can drive men mad.
It's only a sprained ankle.
It's not that painful.
Then what have you been taking?
Something's making you walk on your heels.
There's nothing idiotic about wanting to travel, having the finer things.
What's wrong with retiring while you're young enough to enjoy it?
Well, just where are you gonna get the money for all this, anyway?
Well, I came into a little something.
Well, what about the firm?
What about me?
- You can find somebody to replace me.
- Oh, sure, just like that, huh?
Well, maybe not that easy.
You think not?
Well, let me tell you that no one is indispensable.
- That's what I said.
- Yes.
- Well, don't you ever forget it, either.
- I won't, Larry.
Oh, Darrin, I'm too upset to make any decisions now.
I'll have to think about it.
Larry, it's not your decision, it's mine.
Well, that's a pretty selfish attitude, if you ask me.
And let me tell you something, one of these days you may be sorry.
- Sorry about what?
- Oh, let him tell you.
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Larry, don't go.
I can't listen to any more.
How am I gonna tell Louise?
Darrin, did you and Larry have a fight?
No, of course not.
Then what?
Come here.
- Sam.
- Yes?
- I quit.
- Quit?
- Well, retired might be a better word.
- Darrin, what about your career?
We are going to be my career from now on.
I'm going to spend all my time with you doing the things we wouldn't be able to do for 20 years.
There's nothing wrong with that, is there?
No, I suppose not.
I tried to tell Larry, but he's too interested in his own problems.
- Now, what have you been up to?
- Oh, just shopping.
Good.
When's dinner?
I've got a king-sized appetite.
- King-sized?
- Right.
While you whip up dinner, I'll finish some business I have to attend to.
All right, Mother, all right.
I put my foot in it.
But it wasn't necessary for you to add yours.
I think it was.
The ugliest human disease of all is greed.
I think it's about time you were exposed.
I can't expect Darrin to behave any differently.
It's a phase he was bound to go through sooner or later.
Phase?
My fat Aunt Harriet.
Well a great many human diseases have stimulated a great many cures.
And I think I may have found one.
It's known as "too much of a good thing".
Samantha, what happened to dinner, darling?
Samantha.
Well, look at you.
- Like it?
- It's magnificent.
All new stuff?
Oh, yes, it is.
But this is nothing.
The closets upstairs are full, yours too.
Suits, coats, trousers, shirts, everything.
You didn't have to go to all that trouble.
See, I figured on seeing a tailor when we got to London.
- London?
- Yes, that's my surprise.
- We're going around the world.
- Marvellous.
When?
On our sixth anniversary.
Day after tomorrow, we've been married six months.
Oh, yes, that's right.
London, Paris, Rome, Cairo and Hong Kong.
We can spend two weeks in each place, and then back home.
Home?
Oh, darling, no, why home?
South America, Rio, Buenos Aires, Montevideo.
Well, I thought we should rest up a bit first.
Well I have another idea.
We won't get the least bit tired, and it'll save us a lot of time.
- What is it?
- I could arrange to have memories of those places, and we don't have to leave.
I don't think that's such a good idea, Sam.
Why not?
It's so much easier.
But there'd be nothing to look forward to.
Half of the fun in doing is anticipating.
I hadn't thought of that.
I guess maybe you're right.
Well, sure.
Besides, we'll have plenty to do when we get back getting settled in the new house.
- New house?
Yes, I thought we'd sell this one and then get ourselves a real house.
Well, I think that's a wonderful idea.
A big, roomy, marvellous house with lots of creamy marble and crystal chandeliers and sunken bathtubs.
And balconies.
Oh, I just adore balconies.
With a breathtaking view.
- Not on the flat, like this house.
- I thought you liked this house.
Oh, I do, sweetheart.
Why, this house was just fine.
But things are gonna be different from now on.
I guess they are, aren't they?
- Mr. Stephens?
- Yes.
This is Westridge Realty, Mr. Stephens.
We'd lik e to show your place.
Possibly open house tomorrow?
Well, yes.
Yes, that might be a good idea.
Yes, we'll be back sometime this summer.
Yes, thank you.
Goodbye.
Darrin?
Darrin, who was that?
This is for you.
For me?
- From whom?
- From me.
Oh, Darrin, they're beautiful.
"Happy sixth.
Love, Darrin".
What's in here?
Nothing much.
I bought that a long time ago.
Well, just a couple of weeks, actually, but it seems like a long time ago.
It's beautiful.
Compared to what you have upstairs, it's kind of a silly little thing.
"I love you every second".
Silly, huh?
Darrin, I love you.
I'll go anywhere you want me to go, I'll live anywhere you want me to live but please believe me, this watch and these flowers are the most important things that I've ever had in my whole life.
- All right, sweetheart.
- But I want you to understand.
I do, Sam, I do understand.
Nobody's gonna take them away from you.
Sam, I've done a lot of thinking about the past few days.
I don't know if I'm too crazy about the idea of never having to worry about anything anymore.
Might be a good idea to worry about where your next meal's coming from.
It gives you a chance to work up an appetite.
Oh, you do understand.
Yeah.
But I'm not made of steel, Sam, and I've got a pretty good memory.
I don't know if I can get the taste of the past few days out of my mouth.
Unless Sam, can you do one more thing for me?
If I can.
Can you take me back before all this nonsense started?
If you want it badly enough, I think I can.
I do.
And, lady, if you ever twitched in your life, do it now.
"Whoever finds this, I love you.
Please bring me another pencil".
Samantha!
Coming right up, darling.
Sam.
- I did it again.
- What?
Forgot to lock the back door.
I didn't.
It's locked.
- You sure?
- Positive.
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, darling.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
All right, Mother.
Very funny.
It's really easy if you know how.
Samantha, what happened to your head?
- I gave myself a permanent.
- On purpose?
Yes.
I thought perhaps your finger got stuck in a light socket.
Did I hear you say that you were going out with what's-his-name tonight?
It's our seventh anniversary.
Really, Samantha?
You haven't been carrying on this charade for seven years.
- Seven months, Mother.
- Just seems like seven years.
- You won't give up, will you?
- Not until you do.
- Or he does.
- Well, don't hold your breath.
Darrin loves me.
Samantha, you're living in a fool's paradise.
Sooner or later that perfect husband of yours is going to roam and I don't mean Italy.
- It doesn't have to be that way.
- Oh, yes, it does.
- Why?
- Because he's mortal.
You've done it again, Darrin.
Using the Venus de Milo in this fashion was a stroke of genius.
- Don't you agree, Charlie?
- First-rate.
I'm glad you're pleased.
It's exactly what we've been looking for.
Style, class and just the right implication of allure.
As far as I'm concerned, it's a deal.
I'll carry the ball from here with you and the lawyers.
Slow down, Larry.
I said it was a deal as far as I was concerned.
You are the president of Countess Margaret's Cosmetics, aren't you?
That's right.
And Margaret Marshall is chairman of the board.
I forgot all about the iron tigress.
She's due any minute.
I wouldn't worry too much.
I showed her Stephens' preliminary sketches.
She didn't toss them in the waste.
That's always a good sign.
Oh, boy.
I think she'll buy you.
- Buy me?
- The campaign.
- Yes.
- Miss Marshall's on her way in.
Thank you.
- Miss Marshall.
- Hello, Margaret.
How nice to see you.
You're faking it, Charles.
You know I make you a nervous wreck.
And you can skip the introduction.
I've already met Mr. Tate.
He's been trying to lure my account from Ryan and Worth for three years.
I think I finally made it.
That hasn't quite been decided yet, has it?
- And you're Mr. Stephens.
- Yes.
I like your work.
I hope I'll like you.
I hope so too.
- Well, Charlie, what do you think?
- I'm sold.
- That is, if you are.
- It is good.
Splendid.
Let's sign the paper so that Darrin can get started.
Just a minute.
I said it was good, I didn't say I was ready to sign.
I want Darrin to have the benefit of my thinking on the changes we discussed.
If it comes off as well as I think it will, he'll have the account.
- Sounds fair.
Let's get to work.
- I can't.
I'm late for a meeting.
- But you'll be back.
- Not soon enough.
I'm afraid you'll have to meet me in Chicago.
- Chicago?
- Our home offices are there.
I'll arrange your transportation.
We'll have dinner and get to work.
- Tonight?
- Never argue with a million-dollar account.
I have great plans for us.
- He'll be there.
- Good.
Let's go, Charlie.
We're in, my boy.
Margaret Marshall's signature could mean a quarter million annually.
- It's our anniversary.
- Incidentally she's taken a shine to you.
- Larry She doesn't know you're married.
Until this deal is signed, what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
- Larry, my anniversary.
- Don't swim upstream, Darrin unless you wanna lay an egg.
Hi there.
My, you are home early.
You didn't get fired, I hope.
No.
As a matter of fact, things have been going very well.
Good.
Sam, I've got to talk to you about something.
What happened to your head?
I got my finger stuck in a light socket.
You should see how pretty it's gonna look tonight.
That's what I have to talk to you about.
- We have to call it off.
- Oh, Darrin.
I'm sorry, honey.
It's business.
The head of this cosmetic firm feels my work needs finishing touches and insists upon doing them tonight.
So I have to fly to Chicago.
- Chicago?
- This person flew back this afternoon and practically issued an order for me to follow immediately.
That's very inconsiderate.
- Who is this person?
- What person?
- The head of the firm.
- The name's Marshall.
I'm sorry, but I've just gotta lock up this account.
Darrin?
Aren't you gonna open your present?
Of course, darling.
Beautiful-Iooking box.
- Oh, honey, that's a knockout.
- You like it?
You didn't?
No, of course not.
I've been saving money out of the grocery budget.
It works too.
Here, open yours.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin, it's beautiful.
- You sure you like it?
- It's stunning.
- You have marvellous taste.
- Thank you.
You sure you don't care about tonight?
Well But I understand.
- I would like to come with you.
- No.
I mean, I don't think you'd enjoy it, sweetheart.
- I'd be with you.
- Yes, but I'd be with this person.
There's an unwritten law in the advertising game.
Wives and business just don't mix.
You could take me along in a case with holes in it like a pussycat.
- Nobody would know.
- Honey, I'll be gone a few hours.
If you get Ionely, ask your mother to join you.
I'll think of something to amuse me tonight.
Honey, I'd feel much better if you stayed right here at home.
You promise?
If you promise not let that Marshall person keep you away too long.
It's a deal.
Just tell her your wife's waiting for you.
Her?
Don't say it.
Nothing is farther from my thoughts.
But I told you so.
Mr. Darrin Stephens please step to the tan phone at the information counter.
Mr. Darrin Stephens please step to the tan phone at the information counter.
Hello, Samantha.
- Oh, Larry.
You just caught me.
- Now go to it, my boy.
I don't have to tell you what this account could mean to us.
Look, there's only so much I can do even for McMann & Tate.
And above all, remember, don't tell her you're married.
Okay, Larry.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Mr. Stephens, I'm Kujo.
How'd you know me?
Missy Marshall described you perfectly.
Handsome, strong-Iooking young man.
Sexy eyes, worried.
This way, please.
- Where are you taking me?
- To Missy Marshall.
- At her office?
- Surely you jest.
- I do?
- You dine alone with her at home.
Very private.
Easy to get things done.
Captain Kelly waiting to take you to Missy Marshall in speedboat.
You said I'd meet Missy Marshall I mean, Miss Marshall at home.
Is home.
See.
Name of boat: True Love.
She lives out there?
People who live on yachts don't have noisy neighbours, be all by yourself.
Captain Kelly, this is Mr. Stephens.
Deliver him to Missy Marshall.
My pleasure, sir.
The speedboat's waiting.
Is that your cat?
No, just found it wandering around the end of the pier.
Unusual too.
Most cats don't take much to the water.
I'm moored at the end of the pier.
This way, sir.
Are you taking that cat?
Might as well give it a good home aboard the True Love.
You could tak e me along in a case with holes in it lik e a pussycat.
Would you mind waiting for me?
I'd like to make a phone call.
Looks like our fearless leader caught herself a very nervous one this time.
He has all symptoms of a married man.
He'll be three miles out, no one can get to him there.
Jealous wife make very strong swimmer.
- Confucius.
- Kujo.
I just make it up.
No, operator, I don't remember the area code number.
Your dedication to housework is positively revolting, Samantha.
Be patient.
As soon as I burn the trash, we'll have time for a nice long visit.
You realize, of course, that while you're igniting that Margaret Marshall is doing the same to that husband of yours.
I told you why Darrin went to Chicago.
It's business.
Monkey business.
She's not here, Donald.
You get to your party?
No.
Maybe your party get to other party.
All set, sir?
- I guess so.
- This way, please.
- Did I hear the phone ring?
- I don't know, did you?
- You were standing right there.
- Actually, I was standing over there.
Now that you mention it, I did hear a ringing sound.
Mother, did the phone ring while I was outside or didn't it?
I believe it did.
- Who was it?
- They didn't say.
You answered and you don't know who was on the end?
Well, not exactly.
I didn't answer it.
It must have been Darrin.
- Mother, you really are impossible.
- Well, Samantha, I didn't want to be overly pushy.
He wanted to talk to me and I have no way of reaching him.
Why don't you go to Chicago?
Because I promised I wouldn't.
And because it's underhanded and sneaky and shows a lack of faith.
- All right.
You talked me into it.
- Into what?
- Well, I didn't promise him anything.
After all, someone has to be there to make sure that he's not making a fool of you.
Mother, I forbid you.
You forbid me?
Isn't that divine.
Oh, really, Samantha, I think you've lost your marbles.
Welcome aboard the True Love and down the hatch.
- Thank you.
- All secured, Miss Marshall.
- Good, let's get under way.
- Under way?
- We'll take a cruise while we're planning our campaign.
I plan better away from the crowd.
How far are we going?
We'll see how our plans crystallize.
Why so fidgety?
L I'm just not used to boats.
You're not afraid of me, are you?
Certainly not.
I just think we should get down to business.
So do I. Is something wrong?
I think we better discuss the champagne.
I mean, the campaign.
That's what we're here for after all.
Why are you so nervous?
Cats.
I'm allergic to cats.
They make me sneeze.
Well, we'll have her removed.
She does have a pretty face.
A beautiful, lovely face.
It's the prettiest face I've ever seen.
Kujo, put another bottle on ice and take the pussycat away.
Yes, missy.
Have you always had this trouble?
Oh, I don't have any trouble.
Oh, the allergy.
Oh, yes.
Yes, since I was: You probably never had a pet when you were a boy.
What a shame.
Yes.
Well, now, you were saying at the office this afternoon that you had an idea for a specific approach.
Shall we talk about that?
I always have specific ideas about approaches.
They must be good.
You've been successful.
- Very.
- You own and operate one of the most successful firms of its kind in the country.
It's quite remarkable.
- Does the music bother you?
- Not a bit.
Good.
Shall we dive right into the matter so that I can have the benefit of your thinking?
If you insist.
It's quite simple, really.
Instead of Venus, I thought we'd have a girl rising from the sea on the label.
I might even pose for it myself in something scant and sexy.
Do you think that's too immodest?
Oh, not at all.
But Venus was a classic.
To the women who buy my product Venus is a plump girl who never learned to stop biting her fingernails.
But something scant and sexy, is that the proper image?
I'm beginning to think that you don't think I can handle it.
- I didn't mean that.
- Don't go away.
Samantha?
Where are you?
All right, Samantha, I know it's you.
You gave your word you'd stay home, but you couldn't keep your promise.
Now, what has it accomplished?
It just proves that you don't trust me.
Sweetheart, you know I love you.
Why did you have to do this?
I'Il Samantha?
Samantha, you have no right to act this way.
Now, Sam, I'm here on business, and that's all there is.
Sam.
Hi.
- Looking for something?
- The cat.
- Did she come back?
- Yes.
She must like you.
She did, once.
- When?
- Never mind.
You haven't even noticed.
Do you think the public would mind replacing Venus with me?
Oh, no, you look lovely.
Great.
Marvellous.
Now cover up.
We change the campaign your way.
You win, we're all set.
Now that the business is over shall we get down to the recreational aspect?
You should put on something warmer, you'll catch a cold.
Oh, I'm quite comfortable.
Cosy, as a matter of fact.
- Larry Tate should've come along.
- We don't need him.
Yes, we do.
There are complications he should be aware of.
This is no time to worry about complications or Larry Tate.
Samantha, wait!
Excuse me.
Samantha.
Where are you, darling?
Samantha.
Sam.
Is everything hunky-dory, Mr. Stephens?
Yes, fine.
I'm just taking a turn around the deck.
Salt air is very refreshing.
Yes, I can imagine.
Sam.
Sam.
Sam.
Sam?
Sweetheart, is that you underneath all those feathers?
It's me, Darrin.
Speak to me, sweetheart.
Don't be angry.
You know I love you.
Don't turn away from me like that.
Will you please stop spying on me?
Everything's going to be all right.
Have you been eating fish?
Will you just fly away home?
Oh, excuse me.
Samantha.
Samantha, you're driving me crazy.
Speak to me.
Darling, say something.
Anything at all.
I apologize for thinking you were that ugly bird.
Samantha, I love you.
Don't growl at me, sweetheart.
I know what you mean.
He was behaving very strangely when he was in here.
Captain, you better head the boat back to the mooring.
Aye-aye, Miss Marshall.
Are you always romantic with cats and pelicans instead of women?
Not necessarily.
Captain Kelly couldn't help overhearing your conversation.
It was just a gag.
You understand.
It's hard to explain.
Well, let me help you.
You're married, right?
Oh, yes.
I wasn't supposed to I mean, it never came up so I didn't mention it, but I'm very married, yes.
She must be exceptional.
Oh, she is.
Exceptional, I mean.
If I told you how, you wouldn't believe me.
Oh, spare me the details.
- Then the deal's off?
- Off?
With the best campaign I've seen in years?
Now look, friend, business is one thing, playtime is another.
You've got what I want for the company.
When you get back, you can tell your associates all systems are go.
Clear?
That's very clear.
And I'm sorry that I love my wife.
- I mean I don't mean my wife, I mean - Oh, please, it isn't important.
I'll leave you two alone now.
And one parting word of advice: If I were you, I'd never touch champagne.
You just wait till I get you home.
All right, Sam.
Your little masquerade is over.
You're home now.
Now would you please talk to me before I really get angry?
Hello, darling.
I'm so glad you're home.
I'm so glad to see you.
See me?
I haven't been out of your sight since I left.
What on earth do you mean?
I mean, you haven't been out of my sight since I left this house.
You've been right there, in my mind.
- Just as though you were really there.
- Sweet.
- What were you saying to this cat?
- What cat?
Oh, this cat.
Oh, nothing special.
You know how much I love animals.
Besides, it's a present for you to keep you company in case I ever have to leave home again.
Try not to leave home again.
Good night, Mother.
You never looked lovelier.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- I spoke to your folks yesterday.
- Yeah?
Pop any more used to being retired?
Your mother's having trouble slowing him down.
Last week, he repapered the den, reshingled the roof wrote nine letters to the editor and washed the dog three times.
- Sounds like he's overdoing it.
- Yes, that's what she thinks.
- Poor thing's gone bald in three places.
- What?
The dog, I mean.
I wonder if it was a good idea, their moving to the city and buying a house.
They sounded Ionely, so I asked them over to a dinner party tonight.
Oh, good.
Thank you, sweetheart.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Okay.
Is anybody else coming?
- Just Mother.
- Mother?
Look, my folks are just plain, ordinary, conventional people while your mother Well, let's face it.
Your mother's a witch.
- So is Aunt Clara, and they loved her.
- They didn't believe she was a witch.
They thought she was just an eccentric old lady.
Now, if your mother does one of her vanishing acts they're liable to keel over.
She won't do anything like that.
She promised to be charming.
I've seen some of her charms.
"Bang.
You're a frog".
- There's nothing to be nervous about.
- Then why am I nervous?
Oh, they wanted me to stay on for a few more years, but I said no.
I said, " I'm not one of these old fogies who doesn't know when to retire".
- You enjoy being at home, huh, Father?
- Oh, sure.
- We're having a ball.
Aren't we, Phyllis?
- Oh, yes.
All except the dog, that is.
Hope everybody's hungry.
Dinner will be ready in a few minutes.
Now, don't be offended if I don't eat much, Samantha.
I've been a little off my feed lately.
Mrs. Stephens.
We're so looking forward to meeting your mother, Samantha.
After all, we really know so very little about her.
Well, I'd say that Mother was a rather difficult person to describe.
"Unique" might be the word.
Don't you think so, Darrin?
Yes, that would come close.
Michelangelo was 85 when he built the Pauline Chapel in the Vatican.
- What was that, Pop?
- Michelangelo, 85.
Verdi was 80 when he wrote the opera Falstaff.
And did you know that Winston Churchill was 77 when they made him prime minister in '51?
What's that got to do with anything?
Well, nothing.
I just thought that they were rather interesting facts, that's all.
They didn't retire them.
That'll be Mother.
- Funny.
I don't see any car outside.
- Oh, she walks.
Loves to walk.
Samantha, my child.
- Mother, you look simply divine.
- Oh, thank you, dear.
I'd like you to meet Darrin's parents.
This is my mother.
Mr. Stephens, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mrs. Stephens, Mr. Stephens.
- How do you do?
- Call me Frank.
- Frank?
Oh, then you must call me Endora.
Oh, what a lovely tie.
My favourite colours, blue and white.
Oh, do you really like it?
Phyllis tried to talk me out of wearing it.
She thought it was too flashy.
Do you think so?
Well, I think it just matches his piercing blue eyes.
- How is my favourite son-in-law today?
- You look stunning, Endora.
Yes, that's certainly a nifty outfit.
Dinner's almost ready.
Why don't we all go in and sit down.
Good.
I'm starved.
- Endora.
- Oh, thank you.
I always thought my son-in-law was handsome but now I can see where he gets his good looks.
Mom.
She's quite an interesting woman, isn't she?
Yes, but I wouldn't worry about that, dear.
Samantha probably takes after her father.
I hope you appreciate what an amusing man your husband is, Mrs. Stephens.
Yes.
He's a regular Milton Berle.
I just read about this Ethiopian fellow in the paper who fathered a child at 82.
Now, isn't that amazing?
Not to me.
Among my friends, life really just begins at 80.
- Endora, you're a card.
- Oh, it's nice of you to say so.
Tell me more about yourself.
Well, I enjoy going to theatre when I can drag Phyllis out of the house.
And, of course, I can't get her to go to music.
Well, don't you like musicals, Mom?
I think all that singing and dancing depresses her.
Well, I know exactly how you feel.
There are times when all that singing and dancing depresses me too.
Nonsense.
It's lively.
What are you doing tomorrow evening?
Phyllis and I are going to see a new play.
- I could rustle up an extra ticket.
- Oh, I'd love to.
- Good.
- Sounds like fun.
Mother, you're forgetting you promised Aunt Clara and Bertha you'd be with them tomorrow evening.
Oh, it's no problem.
Frank, I don't think I'll feel up to going out again tomorrow night.
What do you mean, you won't feel like it?
Why not?
- I'm going to have a headache.
- Maybe you could go another time.
Yes.
Yes, I'm sure Frank will need his rest after the excitement of this evening.
Will you stop treating me as if I'm senile?
I made a date, and I'm going to keep it.
We'll go together.
If Phyllis doesn't wanna go along, save me the bother of getting an extra ticket.
Are you sure you won't change your mind?
No, no.
I'm afraid not, dear.
Well, it's getting late.
Frank, it's time to go.
Do you really have to leave?
Yes, dear.
I'm afraid I feel that headache coming on.
- Well, it's been so nice meeting you.
- Thank you.
- Don't keep my husband out too late.
- Perhaps we really should postpone.
No, no.
I wouldn't hear of it.
I've never been one to stand in the way of Frank's fun.
Good night, Samantha, dear.
It's been such a lovely evening.
Wait a minute, Mom.
I'll get your coat.
I'll call you tomorrow.
- Mother, you promised.
- Yes.
I promised to be charming.
I was, wasn't I?
Please, won't you change your mind?
No, dear.
But thank you for a very interesting evening.
- You're making a fool of yourself.
- I'm making a fool of myself?
Good night, dear.
I like that.
You act as if I've done something wrong.
Well, I wouldn't expect you to know Well, I hope you're satisfied.
As I've been saying, Samantha mortals can be very unreasonable.
All right, I apologise.
You were right.
I never should've brought our parents together.
You are right.
I told you your mother was up to something.
I'm beginning to understand why they used to burn witches at Salem.
It's your father.
I had no idea he had such a case of retarded adolescence.
Now, listen to me, Sam.
I will not listen to any more after a remark like that.
If you care to have a calm, rational discussion, I'll be only happy to oblige.
All right, all right.
I give up.
It is hopeless.
Last night?
You mean that little difference of opinion your father and I had?
Well, just don't give it another thought, dear.
Frank and I are too old to hold a grudge.
Mom, I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
As a matter of fact, we had a good laugh about it when we got home.
- Darrin.
- Pop.
Hi, son.
I saw your car outside.
How you feeling?
- Great.
How you feeling?
- Great.
What's the matter?
Sore back?
You'd have a sore back too if you slept on the couch all night.
- Darrin.
- Yes, Mom.
Would you please ask your father if he wants any dinner tonight.
Darrin you can tell your mother I intend to eat with Endora after the show.
You can also tell her that she's welcome to join us if she wants to but I'm not going to beg her.
Darrin, you can tell your father that I wouldn't go if it was Julius Caesar with the original cast.
You can tell her that I'm going to go anyway, and I intend to enjoy myself.
Well, I gotta get this suit pressed.
- Good night, Darrin.
- Good night, Pop.
- Mom, there's no need to get upset.
- I'm not upset.
I must say, I'm a little surprised that after 40 years of marriage my husband should turn out to be a senior delinquent, but I'm not upset.
Mom, you just put the coffee pot in the fridge.
You wanted more?
No.
Mom, I know Dad is inclined to be a little bit stubborn and he's very proud, but - Oh, no.
No, Darrin.
It's not that at all.
- He's smitten with that woman.
- Oh, come on, Mom.
I know it happens sometimes to men at his age and I can understand how he feels.
This retirement has hit him pretty hard, and he thinks life is passing him by.
It's just that well, I don't know what to do to get him back.
Mom, I'm sure you have nothing to worry about.
Oh, I know it's not serious, and I'm not really worried.
I'll just stay calm and put the whole thing out of my mind.
After all what can happen in one evening?
- Exactly.
And now, would you like another cup of divorce?
Oh, it's just ridiculous.
Mother, this is serious.
That man is infatuated with you.
Oh, but I can't get out of going to the theatre now.
What else can I do?
I'll tell you what you can do.
Go and see Mrs. Stephens tomorrow and explain to her that you have absolutely no designs on her husband.
- You have to do it tactfully, of course.
- I'm busy for the next couple of days.
Mother, as a favour to me?
Please?
Samantha if you'd married one of those nice warlocks that were so crazy about you none of this would've happened.
Oh, my stars.
Come in.
Mom.
Well, what are you doing downtown?
I've come to ask your advice about something, Darrin.
Come on and sit down.
Now, what is it?
Do you know the name of a good divorce lawyer?
Well, Charlie Finch Divorce lawyer?
Your father didn't come home last night.
Well, when I got home, I discovered I left my keys in my other jacket so I knocked a couple of times, but Phyllis didn't hear me.
Either that or she wouldn't answer the door.
Rather than disturb the neighbourhood I spent the night here at the club.
Why don't you phone her and tell her what happened?
I did.
Four times.
She wouldn't answer.
You don't think I'm acting like a silly old man, do you?
Not really.
It's just that I find all of this rather hard to understand, that's all.
- Say, that's a pretty scarf.
- A present from Darrin.
All morning I've been thinking about a girl that I went with a long time ago.
Had a scarf just like this.
And a hat, a silly little hat.
I remember I had a spanking-new yellow roadster and I took her out for a drive, out to a place called Angel Falls.
And we laughed, we yelled, we sang.
We did crazy things.
We were very young.
And then I remember there was this thunderstorm.
We couldn't get the top up, but we didn't care.
We just sat there in the pouring rain, laughing our fool heads off.
And then the strangest thing happened.
All of a sudden, I began telling her how Ionely I was and how much I needed her.
And when I finished she wiped my face with that green silk scarf and she said: "You'll never be Ionely again, Frank.
Whenever you need me, I'll be there".
It's funny that I should think of that today, isn't it?
I know it's hard for you to think of Phyllis as being that young but let me tell you, in her day, wow, she was really something.
In her day?
Well, she's something now.
The only thing that's happened is you met Mother and she made you feel young again.
- Yes.
She did.
Do you know what I've been doing every day since I retired?
Filling in the pupils in Little Orphan Annie's eyes in the newspapers.
That's bad, but what really scared me was that was becoming the big event of my day.
I mean, I had nothing else to look forward to.
What Endora did was to point up how drab my life had really become.
I guess that I was getting desperate for some attention.
That's sad, isn't it?
Human, Pop.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
- Where you been?
- Went to see your mother.
We went to the beauty parlour and we went shopping.
- Shopping?
What for?
- Some new dresses and one green silk scarf.
You should see her.
She looks sensational.
I don't see how that has to do with anything.
Well, I simply told her how your father felt.
The most difficult thing was convincing her there was nothing between him and my mother.
- Has Pop seen her yet?
He should be arriving any minute.
Now, you just relax.
I've taken care of everything.
It's open.
The door is open.
I'm in the kitchen.
Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, it's you.
I was expecting someone else.
Well, I won't stay long.
I I just came to apologise for last night.
- Does Frank know you're here?
- Of course not.
I know this must be very embarrassing to you but believe me, I have no intention of breaking up a happy home.
You mean you're willing to give him up?
Well, you could put it that way.
I didn't realise things had gone this far.
What are you trying to say?
That I hope you two will be very happy.
She's given me her husband.
- What am I gonna do with him?
- There must be some mistake.
I told her I didn't want him but she was so busy being the wronged woman that she didn't listen.
- I better go over and talk to her.
Hello?
Oh, Pop.
Where are you?
At the airport.
I'm taking a plane to Miami.
I'm picking up a ship going on a world cruise.
- But where's Mom?
- She wouldn't even talk to me.
When I got home, she'd left for the railroad station.
She's probably on a train right now.
- Where's she going?
- Home to her mother in Phoenix.
Look, I've gotta go now.
They're calling my flight.
Wait a minute.
Stay there.
I'll pick you up.
- We can work this thing out.
- No, no.
It's no use, Darrin.
You just look after yourself now.
Pop Have you got any more bright ideas?
My father's on a plane to Florida.
My mother's on a train to Phoenix.
I'd like to see somebody solve this.
If only somehow we could get them together I'm sure their problem would be solved.
Mother will you help me?
- Oh, it'd be an awful strain, dear.
I haven't tried anything like that in years.
But you know it's important.
Still, it would be an interesting challenge.
- Where shall we bring them together?
- Angel Falls.
It has sentimental value.
Angel Falls.
Well, the first thing we have to do is slow down the train.
- Right.
- You wanna try?
Sure.
- Who pulled the emergency cord?
- I did.
Well, why would you do that, lady?
You know, I don't know.
That'll hold them for a few minutes.
It's nice to know I haven't lost my touch.
Mother will take over from here.
Now, just give me room.
Hello, friends.
This is Captain Harcourt speaking.
Welcome aboard flight 645, nonstop to Miami.
We're flying at an altitude of 26,000 feet and in just a few minutes, we'll be landing in Angel Falls.
Angel Falls?
- What made you say that?
- I don't know.
Mother, do they have an airstrip in Angel Falls?
There will be by the time they land.
I'm terribly sorry.
I just don't know what came over me.
I don't usually do things like that, you know.
- Sure, lady, sure.
- Well, I'm fine now, so you can relax.
- I'll behave myself.
- Is that a promise?
Now, I better get back to that train.
What's the matter with you?
You're throwing the passengers all over.
Well, I'm terribly sorry, sir.
- I'll wait at the depot.
- What depot?
We're out in the middle of nowhere.
By golly, there is a depot out there.
- Frank, you're here.
- Yeah.
- Somehow I knew you'd be here too.
- Isn't it strange?
I pulled the cord twice.
I don't know why.
- But I'm glad I did.
- I'm glad too.
You look awfully pretty, Phyllis.
Pretty as the last time we were here.
There's been a lot of time in between but nothing has changed much.
- Has it, Frank?
- No, nothing's changed.
It's funny how you let things get out of hand.
I thought you'd lost interest in me so I tried to make you feel as old as I felt.
- I'm sorry, dear.
- Oh, no.
It was all my fault, Phyllis.
I was acting like an old goat.
Maybe we're not as old as we think.
Maybe we're not.
May I drive you somewhere?
Home.
Sam.
Sam.
I just talked to Mom and Dad.
- Guess where they are.
- Where?
- Angel Falls.
- Really?
- Oh, how nice.
- Nice?
It's fantastic.
They were on the verge of divorce, heading in different directions.
My dad used to tell me about Angel Falls.
He proposed to Mom right in the middle of a thunderstorm.
I forgot the thunderstorm.
What thunderstorm?
What was that for?
I just wanted everything to be perfect.
All this should be a lesson to us.
We must not become used to each other.
I don't think I'll ever become used to you, darling.
That's sweet of you to say.
You can see how important it is to keep romance in a marriage.
Promise me you'll never stop being romantic.
Darrin?
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Hello.
Just toast.
I got another rough one.
Things are really jumping down at the office.
Has the mail come yet?
Well, I haven't Yes, it's here.
- Mother?
- Did you say something, honey?
No, no, sweetheart, just mumbling.
Darrin, my cousin Mario's getting married.
He is living in Egypt.
It's going to be a big wedding.
That's nice.
His fiancée wants me to be matron of honour.
Matron of honour at a wedding in Egypt?
The weather in Cairo is marvellous this time of year.
- I might have known.
- Samantha Mario's fiancée is simply beautiful, socially prominent one of us, of course.
You be sure to give him our best, because Samantha won't be there.
- That is ridiculous, of course she will.
- No, Mother.
Darrin can't get away right now and I'm not going anywhere without him.
- You can't mean that.
- Well, she certainly can and does.
If she goes anywhere, it'll be with me, the old-fashioned way.
You really mean to set yourself against me?
Well, I prefer to call it exercising my prerogative as a husband.
I'll send a note of regret this afternoon.
That won't be necessary.
I'll take the message myself.
Oh, yes.
Speaking of messages I have one for you, young man.
- Yes?
- You're in trouble.
Well, just fix it, huh?
Just fix it.
All right.
Hello.
Well, tell him I'm sorry, I just haven't had time.
- Morning, Darrin.
- Good morning, Larry.
- What time is Woolfe?
- Phone.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Yes.
You're darn tootin' I objected, Carson.
That girl looked like Sophia Loren.
She's supposed to be 16 years old.
All right.
Every advertising executive in the country is trying to land the Woolfe Brothers account.
And I'm supposed to get it with sketches that look like they came out of a girlie magazine.
Down, boy.
Relax.
Uncle Larry has the answer to all your problems.
- Another head.
- Very funny.
But I was referring, as you well know, to an assistant.
Come on.
I've told you I just don't have time to train another man.
Delegate authority.
That's the secret.
Look, do yourself a favour.
There's a boy named Gideon Whitsett in the copywriting department.
- Give him a chance to help you.
- Okay, Larry.
- Send him up.
- Fine.
- Hope to be of further service Come in.
I remain, et cetera, et cetera.
Mr. Stephens, I'm Gideon Whitsett.
I just wanted to tell you how much this means to me.
- We're glad to have you aboard.
- That's very kind, sir.
You can drop the "sir".
I'm not that much older than you.
Oh, well, that's true, sir.
I mean, Mr. Stephens.
It seems that way because you've accomplished everything I've ever dreamed of.
We have a meeting with Mr. Woolfe.
I'm sorry I won't be able to brief you.
Just keep your eye on me and play it by ear.
- Certainly.
Would it be all right if I took a few notes while you're talking?
I've got a lot to learn and you're the man I wanna learn it from.
Sure, fine.
Mr. Woolfe, this is our Mr. Stephens.
Oh, you're the bright young man I've been hearing so much about.
No, no, Mr. Woolfe.
This is our Mr. Stephens.
How do you do?
And this is Stephens' assistant, Gideon Whitsett.
- Ashtray, sir?
- Oh, thank you, Whitsett.
Harvard or Yale?
Oh, I believe you've got me spotted already, sir.
I knew it.
I know a Yale man when I see one.
Best of the breed.
- Team, team, team!
- Team, team, team!
- Those were the golden days.
- Yes, indeed.
Sit over here.
I'm sure you'll be more comfortable.
- Thank you.
- As I was saying, Mr. Woolfe we feel that Stephens here is - Who?
Stephens, Missouri U, class of '50.
Now, what I'd like to emphasize in this campaign are three major areas.
Sir, would you like to take a few notes?
Oh, thank you.
The teenage ready-to-wear market and competing with the discount companies in the appliance sales.
Fine material.
I like your tailor.
- Worked for our family for years.
- Oh, really?
Appliance sales.
And updating our approach to home tailoring Home furnishing.
Give me his name, of course.
Concentrating on the first major market, I'd like to I'd start with a Seem to have the hiccups.
- Darrin.
- Oh, thanks, Larry.
I would like to call your attention to the young lady standing in the foreground young gentleman in the rear, and the caption reads, "He'd like to hold your" "He'd like to hold your" If you'll allow me.
"He'd like to hold your hand when you wear your discotheque dress from Woolfe Brothers".
I don't know.
Can't it be phrased in good old-fashioned English?
Yes, sir, I think it could.
Oh, no, it couldn't.
The teenagers of today are very keen on - Why not just call it a party dress?
- Now you're talking.
- No, he's not.
- Plain and simple.
That's what I like.
You know, Tate, this boy's got a lot on the ball.
Well, thank you, Mr. Woolfe.
Well, Gideon, you and Stephens make a fine team.
Right, Darrin?
It's been a great day.
I'm looking forward to our meeting this evening with Mr. Woolfe.
I bet.
You know, I was looking over your personnel file.
You never went to Yale.
Why, no, sir.
I never said I did.
You gave every impression you did.
I forgot my briefcase.
Why don't you go ahead, and I'll meet you there.
Your elevator is temporarily stalled.
Find the red button mark ed "Emergency" and press.
- Why today?
Why?
- Lf the elevator does not start This is the moment of truth, I will not panic.
- Then press again.
- Help!
Let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Help!
Find the red button mark ed "Emergency" and Mr. Tate, this is Gideon Whitsett.
I think Mr. Stephens has been held up somewhere.
He kept Mr. Woolfe waiting?
I'm afraid so, sir, but I stepped into the race, so to speak.
I took the liberty of covering for him.
Good for you.
How'd it go?
Brilliantly, if I may say so, sir.
I feel quite confident that Mr. Woolfe is gonna sign with our agency providing, of course, I give him the name of my tailor.
Woolfe seems to think the world of me.
I don't know why.
I do.
You're a very capable young man.
Valuable too.
Well, thank you, Mr. Tate.
That means a great deal to me.
- Goodbye now, sir.
- Goodbye.
I'm telling you, from the minute that guy walked in it's been one disaster after another.
- I know, sweetheart.
It's like he jinxed me.
I've never been stuck in an elevator in my whole life.
That's a terrible experience.
- Mother did that to me once when l - Say that again.
- What?
- Your mother?
Oh, no.
Now, you can't blame this on her.
That happens accidentally sometimes too.
Yeah, I suppose it does to normal people with normal mothers-in-law.
- You're late.
- I ran out of gas.
Can you believe that?
I know, but I filled the tank yesterday.
- Oh, there you are.
- I apologize, gentlemen.
I'm not usually late, but things keep happening.
Never mind, Whitsett's been showing the layouts.
But I left the layouts at home.
That's why I had to go back.
- When I went back, I ran out of gas - It's all right, Darrin.
Clever, very clever.
I like your ideas.
Of course, we'll have to make a few little changes.
- Anything you say, sir.
- Good afternoon, eh Stephens.
I'd like to explain - Don't make waves.
- Waves?
Why, that thieving, no-good Larry, I was up all night coming up with this.
This is my exact layout.
Which you left at home.
Which I left at home.
Therefore he Then how could it?
- How did he?
- Black magic, maybe?
Would you believe me if I said yes?
Darrin, you're tired.
You need a rest.
You've been working too hard.
I want you to take the next few days off.
And don't worry, Gideon has everything under control.
Yes, and so does Endora.
Endora.
Endora, come on, I wanna talk to you.
Endora.
I know you're here somewhere.
- Endora?
- Darrin?
Darrin, how come you're home so early?
Mother dear, come out.
Come out wherever you are.
Darrin, she's not here, not now.
Oh, yes, she is.
She's right here.
She's going to make good her threat.
- She's going to replace me in my job.
- Oh, Darrin, you're wrong.
- She's had nothing to do with this.
- And it won't stop with just him.
Before you know it, the entire agency will be witches, then the building then the street.
Today Madison Avenue, tomorrow the world.
I know it looks suspicious, but try to keep an open mind for your own sake.
Now, wait a minute.
You assume that just because a young man comes into the office who's efficient Efficient?
He's a tarantula.
Well, I don't care if he's the Marquis de Sade.
Just because you had some bad luck doesn't necessarily mean he's a witch.
Not witch, Samantha, warlock.
A term with which you and your relations should be familiar like dear old cousin Mario.
Darrin, this is dangerous.
- Do you know what's happening?
- Funny Napoleon was asked the same question before Waterloo.
The way you're talking, everything bad that happens to you is witchcraft.
You bet your sweet broomstick.
Just consider the evidence.
Sudden, paralyzing inefficiency.
Being stuck in elevators, hiccup attacks, running out of gas.
With evidence like that, you should've been at Salem.
Searching for straws, am I?
Then how do you explain the fact that these layouts on the table young Whitsett had at the office today.
- You discussed it with him.
- It could never happen.
I came up with the idea last night.
I drew it and I left it on the table.
And yet, he had it in the office today.
Now, how'd he do that?
How did he do it?
How?
Darrin Stephens, you stop yelling at me.
It's a simple case of Witchcraft?
- Poor, poor Denton.
- Darrin.
For the first time, I actually feel sorry for you.
- So you were here.
- As it happens, I just got back.
Oh, it was a beautiful wedding.
I suppose I got overly sentimental.
- I mean, Duncan - Darrin.
Oh, yes.
Derwin, you may be second-rate, but you are family.
What are you talking about?
- You are in trouble, aren't you?
- Yes.
Well, the only way to break a spell is with another spell.
You mean you're going to give me something so I can play on his side of the court and win?
As I said before you are family.
Well, that's great!
Or is it?
How do I know I can trust you?
Suit yourself.
But I'm the only game in town.
Aren't I?
I hope you know what you're doing.
I don't think this is the right time for this presentation.
Personally, I was hoping we'd spend a little more time talking together before I met Harrison's Mr. Woolfe's board of directors.
After you, gentlemen.
Gentlemen, our slogan for the all- important home furnishing division is: "Live" "Live" "Live with tomorrow today, the Woolfe Brothers time plan way".
Now, our statistics show that over Over Seems to be stuck.
Allow me.
That over 38 percent of all home-furnishing sales are made on the time payment plan.
Our recommendation is that such a plan be inaugurated by Woolfe Bros and that that plan be called: "Easy" If you'll just bear with us, we seem to be having a few technical difficulties.
Are you all right?
You actually gave him something to use?
You tricked him?
Yes, darling, but it wasn't real magic.
I only did it to give him self-confidence.
It was only baking soda, ammonia and garlic salt.
In an atomizer.
Here you see the home of tomorrow as furnished by Woolfe Brothers.
Mr. Whitsett.
It's our recommendation that this scale be used as a mobile promotional unit designed to arrest the attention of potential purchasers.
To be shown at decorators, home shows Say, that thing's got a short.
Mr. Stephens, it's on fire.
- Fire!
Fire!
- Hold it.
Don't panic.
Mr. Stephens, do something.
You bet your life I will.
Something I should've done a long time ago.
Take that.
Look out!
Look out, Darrin.
And that!
How do you feel, sweetheart?
Fine, just great.
That's good.
Darrin, where's your briefcase?
Down in the den.
Why?
Larry phoned.
Gideon's coming over to pick up the Woolfe Brothers file.
That's it?
Just turn in your stripes and your Woolfe Brothers file just like that?
Afraid so.
Who cares!
Go ahead and give it to him.
Maybe you can exchange a few witch recipes while you're at it.
Maybe.
Oh, nothing, darling.
That'll be him.
I'll see you later.
- Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
- Mr. Whitsett, isn't it?
Yes, indeed it is.
I hope I haven't come at an inconvenient time.
I just stopped by to pick up the Woolfe Brothers material.
Yes, it's in the den.
Won't you come in?
Oh, you have a very lovely place here, Mrs. Stephens.
Happy home, happy marriage.
You can tell when two people are suited to one another.
- Thank you.
I'm terribly concerned about Mr. Stephens.
Is he feeling better?
- Not much, I'm afraid.
- I'm sorry to hear that.
He's such a wonderful man.
He's my idol.
But I suppose he's already told you how I feel about him.
Oh, yes, he has.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, I'm really terribly grateful to Mr. Stephens.
He's the one who gave me my first really big opportunity.
You certainly took advantage, didn't you?
I just hope I can measure up to the standards he set.
Mr. Whitsett, how do you manage to be so charming all day long?
It must be exhausting.
Oh, no, no, not at all.
I like to please people.
You know what they say, catch more flies with honey.
- You're just too good to be true.
- Oh, I wouldn't say that.
I would.
I wish I had the power to see you as you really are.
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.
You gotta step on people to get where you're going.
Push and shove.
- I guess so.
- I know so.
I'm not afraid to swing my machete and lop off a few heads.
That's very courageous.
Most people probably don't know how hard you work to get what you want.
- Do you think I'm underrated?
- I'm sure of it.
Have you always been like this?
When I was 6 years old, I had 10 kids on paper routes and they turned all the profits over to me.
- Remarkable.
- By the time I was in college I was so rich I hired a flunky to pass my exams for me while I concentrated on some of the more important things.
I was out there promoting every second.
I'll bet you were.
Cigarette?
Oh, thank you.
Oh, go ahead, it's just the two of us.
Be yourself.
Light the cigarette our way.
- Our way?
I don't get you.
- The table lighter doesn't work.
- Oh, well, have you got a light?
- Certainly.
What is it with you people and fire?
Oh, I am sorry, but accidents will happen.
Now, you do all these wonderful things yourself?
- Oh, you said it, baby.
- With no supernatural help?
Oh, no.
No supernatural, natural or otherwise.
It's kill or be killed.
It's a rough world.
You gotta be the firstest with the mostest.
Know what I mean?
- Play the angles.
- The angles.
Of which I'm happy to say you have none.
But you have.
Like fixing the exhibit so it would fall apart.
- You've been peeking.
- And stalling elevators?
Oh, now, how would I have done that?
Well, you couldn't.
Could you?
Well, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't.
Pushing all the buttons with "hold" at the same time.
Oh, that's very clever.
- I bet you could work magic.
- You better believe it.
Otherwise, how would you have the same layout at the office that Darrin left at home?
I'm a winner, baby.
I keep telling you.
Doodling.
Darrin doodles all the time while he talks on the phone.
He drew that layout the day before and didn't even know it, did he?
Wars have been won from wastepaper baskets, baby.
- Stephens!
- A slip of the lip can sink a ship.
You know, I don't believe he is a witch.
You know, I believe you're right.
- Darrin, these sketches are brilliant.
- Thanks, Larry.
I hope Mr. Woolfe agrees.
Well, yes.
Then again, no.
Where's young Whitsett?
He knows what I want.
Young Whitsett is back sharpening pencils.
Oh, incidentally, his approach to what you say you want is dead wrong.
And suppose I want things done my way.
Then you better go to another agency.
You told the last one what you wanted and your sales dropped 23 percent, I believe.
Twenty-four.
So?
So if you want a well-planned campaign stressing the approach that you need then listen to what you're paying for and stop telling the doctor how to practice.
Okay.
I never argue with figures.
Talk, Missouri U, talk.
All it took was a little self-confidence.
To you, you beautiful witch.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Oh, more brandy?
No, thanks.
Just plain old-fashioned insecurity and I nearly flipped.
Can you believe that?
It happens all the time.
Well, he saw it and he used it.
No witchcraft, no black magic.
Just an unscrupulous kid and me working against myself.
Mother's often said that mortals are their own worst enemies.
The one word I don't like to hear.
- "Enemies"?
- "Mother".
Now, darling, try to forgive her.
She only gave you what you asked for.
Besides I'm afraid I said some pretty nasty things to her.
- You did?
- This morning.
She was so upset, she vowed she'd never come back.
Really?
You mean we're finally rid of your?
We're finally rid of your?
- Oh, dear.
- Do you think she really meant?
Well, I was positive that, that Gesundheit.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Well, hello there.
Where'd you come from?
- You hungry?
- I don't think so.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
Looking for your cat?
No, my bird.
Oh, my stars.
Well, you don't mean?
Well, I put Tweety out for her sunbath.
Then I heard this meowing and when I went out, the cage was empty.
- There she is.
- Where?
- There.
Don't you see?
- No, I don't see.
Where?
There you are, Tweety!
Oh, I'm so glad you're safe.
Oh, Tweety, don't you ever worry your mommy like that again.
You saw Tweety way up there on the roof.
- You must have wonderful eyes.
- Thank you.
- I'm glad Tweety's back.
- Oh, so am I. Oh, Tweety.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Wally.
How are you?
In trouble, as usual, Samantha.
Has Darrin left yet?
No, no, he hasn't.
Just a second, I'll call him.
Darrin It's for you.
Wally Ames, he sounds upset.
I'll bet he does.
Hello, Wally.
What's that?
Rick Avery called.
He's tired of waiting for Pickering to approve a girl for the Jewel of the East campaign.
He said to tell you that he's on his way to Paris.
So he's on his way to Paris.
When we find the right girl, you'll photograph her.
Of course you can do it, Wally.
You're every bit as good as Avery.
The only trick is to find a girl that Pickering will approve.
- He said to tell you - Don't panic, Wally.
I'll be down as soon as I can.
Goodbye.
Here, darling, drink this.
I'll fix the eggs.
Never mind, honey.
I won't have time.
There isn't a girl in this city Pickering will approve as the Jewel of the East.
- What's he looking for?
- Someone exotic and Eastern for the annual institutional layout.
We haven't found the right face.
Well, don't worry.
You'll find her, I know you will.
It better be soon.
We're down to the deadline.
I only need her for one day.
- I wish I could help you.
- So do I. But never mind.
I'll see you tonight.
He's very upset, you know.
Say, you're exotic-Iooking.
And you come from the East.
You may just be the right face.
Cat, how'd you like to be a cover girl?
The Jewel of the East.
The point is, Wally, you've been doing Avery's work for years.
He got the reputation.
You've got the talent.
- I wish I could believe that.
- I do too because it's the truth.
All you need is a chance.
Are you willing to give Wally a shot at the Pickering campaign?
What makes you think there'll be a campaign?
- All we need's the right model.
- How many have we shown him?
- Twenty, 25.
- All great-Iooking girls and he hasn't okayed one, right?
- Right.
Suppose the impossible happened and the right girl did walk in.
Would we have time to make the next issue?
Sure, if she walked in right this minute.
- Yes.
- There's a young lady to see you.
- Not now.
- I think you'd better see this one.
Okay.
Send her in.
- Cheer up, Larry.
This may be the one.
- Dreamer.
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
My name is Ling-Ling.
A friend suggested I might serve your needs as the girl for the Jewel of the East campaign.
I haven't much experience, but I'm very adaptable and agile.
Would you be interested in me?
What's the trouble?
Cat got your tongue?
I don't know about the others, but I think you'd be perfect.
- She is perfect.
- Sensational.
- Gentlemen, I think we're in business.
- I think you're right.
Wally, I want you to take a shot of Miss Ling-Ling.
A headshot.
Larry, why don't you see Pickering, get him all steamed up.
- I'll wait for the picture and meet you.
- Good thinking, Darrin.
If he doesn't go for this, he doesn't deserve a campaign.
In fact, don't wait for Pickering's okay.
Shoot the campaign like we planned it.
- I've got the assignment?
- Has he, Larry?
- What's he waiting for?
- What are you waiting for?
Yes, what are we waiting for?
Miss Ling-Ling, would you sit up here in this seat, please and just relax, be comfortable.
That's it.
You can drop the coat anywhere you want.
That's a beautiful necklace.
These lights might get a little warm after a while.
I'm sorry to have to rush you this way.
Oh, that's all right.
I'm used to moving swiftly.
When I have to.
You're tilting your head too much.
Would you straighten it up and look right into the lens, please?
Oh, now you're Now you're looking too much the other way.
Just watch the birdie.
- Birdie?
- That's it.
Hold it.
Hold it.
That's fine.
You can relax now.
- Well, that's it.
You were wonderful.
- Thank you.
- Would you like cream in your coffee?
- No coffee.
Just cream, please.
You know, I have a hunch you're gonna be lucky for me.
- Lucky?
- Lf they sell the Pickering people we've got a great campaign started.
Started?
You must have taken Almost.
And I must say, you were wonderful.
- I've never seen such patience.
- It's one of my virtues.
- Congratulations, Miss Ling-Ling.
- You are officially the Jewel of the East.
- May I change now?
- Of course.
Wally, it worked.
Pickering was crazy about that picture you took.
Wait till he sees what we got this afternoon.
He'll go out of his mind.
She's great.
- I agree wholeheartedly.
- So do I. This calls for a celebration.
At my house.
Why don't you call Louise and have her meet us at 7.
- It's a date.
- We'll drink to the success of the most promising photographer in town.
Well, thanks to you, Darrin.
And that fabulous girl.
She's so self-reliant.
So So delicate and graceful.
Well, what do you know?
I think Wally found himself a model and a new career in the same afternoon.
- See you at the house.
- You better phone Samantha.
Let her know you're bringing a crowd.
It is awfully short notice.
Maybe I better bow out.
- You'll do nothing of the kind.
- She can handle it?
Gentlemen, my wife can handle anything.
But I'd better call her, just in case.
I told Abner about your finding Tweety this morning.
You remember?
- Oh, yes, of course.
- By the way, have you seen that cat?
I sent her out on an errand.
She should be back any minute.
It wasn't important.
I'll bet Mr. Kravitz is glad to get Tweety back too.
No, he wasn't.
He hates birds.
Say, are you going out to dinner tonight?
No, I was just going through the cookbook to see if I could find something different.
I just wondered.
Your kitchen is so uncluttered, and it's after 6.
It doesn't take long.
It's just the two of us.
Well, I'd better get back to my own kitchen.
Bye.
Hello?
Oh, hi, darling.
I've got a lot to tell you, all good.
I'm bringing Wally, Larry and Louise home.
Is that the good news?
No, it's the Pickering account.
I'll tell you when I get there.
How soon will that be?
I'm leaving right now.
Bye, sweetheart.
Oh, well, goodbye, sweetheart.
Cocktails and dinner for all those people.
Oh, dear.
Darrin, please forgive me, but I'm sure that you'd consider this an emergency.
First, the hors d'oeuvres.
Splendid.
Now that cream soup that Darrin's so crazy about.
Now, let's see A leg of lamb might be nice.
And maybe a green salad with some rolls and an unpretentious little wine.
Delicious.
Now, I wonder what would be good for dessert.
I just stopped back to explain that remark I made about Abner.
He doesn't hate all birds.
Just mine.
You know what I think?
You know, I think he's jealous of the time I spend with her.
- Sardines.
Delicious.
- Have another.
Look at all this food.
Where did it come from?
- The market.
- Yeah, but I mean, a minute ago, there was nothing here.
I'm a fast worker.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
I knew there was nothing here.
I wish I was a fast worker.
Now, dessert.
Honey, I'm home.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Where are the others?
- Right behind me.
- Is everything all right with the food?
- Just fine.
- Hi, Samantha.
- Samantha.
I bet you're delighted to have us turn up at the last minute like this.
I'm delighted to see both of you anytime.
Darrin, she's a gem, an absolute gem.
If I pulled this on Louise, she'd kick me out.
And Samantha would probably be foolish enough to let you in.
- Where's Wally?
- Here I am.
- I brought a friend.
I hope it's all right.
- Of course it is.
Come on in.
It's all right.
She was a little timid about imposing, Samantha but I told her you wouldn't mind.
Relax, Ling-Ling, you're among friends.
She does look a little nervous, doesn't she?
Nervous as a cat.
Actually, we discovered we have a lot in common.
Ling-Ling doesn't care much for drinking.
She likes to hunt and fish.
And at night, she Oh, thank you.
She's perfectly content to just curl up around a fire.
Not only that, but she's really a sweet gal.
- Curious about everything - You forgot Ling-Ling.
Oh, I don't want to spoil her dinner.
We'll be going in in a minute.
Well, at least offer her some.
You'd better hurry.
She's starving to death.
- Here you are, Louise.
- Thank you.
Ling-Ling, did Wally tell you he was a tennis champ at college?
I don't think he mentioned it.
He used it to work his way through school.
Quite a racket if you'll excuse the pun.
How about you telling us your side of the story?
What do you feel about this lovesick shutterbug?
- I beg your pardon?
- Wally.
What do you think of him?
Oh, I like him.
He gave me a pretty collar to wear and took my picture.
A pretty collar?
The Jewel of the East, and she calls it a pretty collar.
I wish Pickering could hear that.
There are spoons for those of you who wish to use them.
However, if you prefer to drink your soup in the native manner like Ling-Ling, you'll find it a delicious way to savour the brew.
You sound like a guide.
Lap up your soup, darling, before it gets cold.
Those two are getting serious.
Did you see how he looked at her through dinner?
- She's something to look at, isn't she?
- Yes, she certainly is.
I think maybe Ling-Ling and I ought to have a little girl talk.
Ling-Ling?
You're angry because I didn't come back.
Oh, you came back, all right.
Now, I know it's just as much my fault as it is yours.
But I wanted to help my husband.
I had no idea it would go this far.
- Well, it has, and I like it.
- But it's impossible.
- Oh, is it?
- Of course.
Wally's just finding himself and you cannot let him fall in love with you.
You cannot lead him on, promising things you can never give him.
- Why not?
- Because sooner or later you're going to have to go back to what you really are.
You're gonna wake up in a little tiny fur coat you won't be able to take off.
Then where will you be?
Oh, I know how you feel about Wally now.
Basically, you're very independent.
You'll get over it.
I don't feel one way or the other about Wally.
But I do like things the way they are.
I like to be pampered and made a fuss over.
As long as he does that, I'll stay with him.
- Now, Ling-Ling, you listen to reason.
- I'm not interested.
You wouldn't be if you spent your life scrounging around alleys searching for scraps.
But all that's over with now.
From now on, it'll be martinis and sardines all the way.
Ling-Ling, I'm shocked.
Don't be, pet.
Where I come from, it's one big rat race.
Hi there.
- Am I interrupting anything?
- Oh, no, darling.
We're just having a little kit-cat Chitchat.
And we're all finished now.
So if you'll excuse me She is all girl, isn't she?
- Not exactly.
- There's something different about her.
- You can say that again.
- What's the matter?
Don't you like her?
It's not that, Darrin.
It's Oh, she's just wrong for him.
Wally's crazy about her.
I might as well get this over with.
Ling-Ling is wrong for any man.
What do you mean by that?
- She's a cat.
- Why?
Did she say something about Louise?
Not that kind of a cat.
A "cat" cat.
Honey, you're not making any sense.
- You're not listening.
- Well, say what you mean.
I said it.
Ling-Ling is a cat.
A cat?
A "cat" cat?
Oh, no.
No.
No, honey.
You didn't take a cat and turn it into a A Siamese cat.
You wanted something exotic and Eastern for the campaign.
I thought I was doing you a favour.
A favour?
You took a cat and turned it into a girl?
I can't believe that.
Why can't I believe that?
I'm married to a witch.
A witch can do anything.
She took a cat, turned into a girl and my friend fell in love with her.
What's so hard to believe?
- Darrin, please.
- Can you change her back?
- Not in front of all those people.
- What are we gonna do?
You're Wally's friend, you tell him.
You're right.
I'll have to tell him.
I'll go right out there and tell him.
Tell him what?
Just try and discourage his feeling for her.
I'll take care of the rest later.
Have a heart.
Ling-Ling and I were making plans for tomorrow.
Wally, this can't wait.
It's about her.
- What about her?
- Well, she - She's no good.
- What?
You heard me.
- Why would you say a thing like that?
- Because she's She's just not right for you.
Let me be the judge of that.
Besides, you hardly know her.
Believe me, I know more about her than I can say right now.
I don't care about her past.
She's told me about that.
She's been around, but she's always landed on her feet.
There's more to it.
You don't understand.
Darrin, I've always considered you a friend, but you're way out of line.
I am your friend.
If you only knew how much of a friend I'm trying to be, that Wally?
Oh, Ling-Ling, we were just talking about you.
You will excuse us.
- Ling-Ling?
You forgot your drink.
- Oh, thank you.
- What happened?
- What could happen?
He doesn't know she's a cat, but now he thinks I'm a rat.
Don't you worry.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
- I'll bet.
- I put something in her drink.
- Catnip, I suppose.
- Yes.
- Sam, you didn't.
- I did.
It'll relax her.
She just may tip her paw.
You look lovely in the moonlight.
Ling-Ling, I'm crazy about you.
Everybody else is trying to interfere.
I won't listen.
You're the most wonderful girl in the world.
You're so beautiful and so graceful.
So sweet.
- Are you all right, Ling-Ling?
- Perfect.
Listen, there's something very important I want to tell you.
Don't drink any more.
I want you to hear what I have to say.
- Give it back.
- What's the matter, Ling-Ling?
- I want it back.
- Ling-Ling.
I want it back.
Sounds like the lovebirds are having a little spat.
Oh, I hope not.
They were getting along so well.
Does a little nip mean more to you than I do?
Ling-Ling, I thought you cared for me.
You may need this.
Don't stray too far.
- Louise, I think we'd better go.
- Larry, wait.
Well, it is getting late.
But Wally's coming in.
- Oh, my, Wally.
- What happened?
Ling-Ling.
You were right.
There must be something wrong with her.
I think she's a you know, or something.
- Wally, I'm sorry.
I don't know what came over her.
I just took her drink and all of a sudden she arched her back and hissed at me and scratched me.
It was terrible.
- Good heavens.
- That's too bad, but don't worry.
She probably had too much.
Happens in the best of families.
She'll probably call and apologise tomorrow.
I wouldn't be too sure about that.
It's better that you found out now than later.
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Of course.
After all, you're going to be a famous photographer.
Think of the pretty girls you'll be meeting.
Yeah.
It was just disappointing, though.
We had a date tomorrow to go birdwatching.
What are you doing now?
It's for that cat that's been hanging around, Abner.
- I feel guilty for what happened today.
- What happened?
I accused her of molesting Tweety.
She should get a medal.
I'm just gonna leave her a saucer of milk to apologise.
Here, puss, puss, puss.
Here, puss, puss, puss.
Well, it's here when you're ready, puss.
- It's been quite a day, hasn't it?
- Yes, but it turned out all right.
- Even for Ling-Ling.
- Ling-Ling!
I forgot to change her back.
- Abner!
- Yeah?
Abner, there's a woman in a fur coat lapping up the milk.
Is there?
Ling-Ling?
Abner, will you please come look?
Abner, hurry!
Ling Good.
Here, Gladys.
I thought I'd be prepared this time.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Yes, indeed.
This table is one of our most treasured 17th-century pieces.
A steal at only $450.
Yes.
It would be a steal, wouldn't it?
Are you sure it isn't Well, perhaps early 18th century.
- Excuse me, please.
- Certainly.
Perhaps something like this rocker might interest you.
It is very quaint.
It is.
It's Flemish.
Pennsylvania Dutch.
We were thrilled when we discovered this in the attic of a cottage in Belgium.
- Philadelphia.
- Madam.
If you please.
Excuse me.
Hello.
You know, Samantha, they don't make these things like they used to.
I must say, coming to these places is quite stimulating.
They hold such happy memories.
I remember the time your father and I were in Istanbul and you - Samantha, are you listening to me?
- Yes, of course, Mother.
Well, you share in these memories too, you know.
I know.
But now I am more interested in the present and the future with Darrin.
I won't have you ignore your heritage.
I'm not ignoring it.
I'm putting it in its place.
I am your mother, and I shall decide its proper place.
Now, you have to understand, now that I'm married things cannot be the way they were with us.
So it's come to that.
You forsake your mother for a mere mortal.
Mother, we've been all over that.
- Is that you?
- Yes, honey.
Oh, hi.
You're home early.
I thought I'd do a little work in the garden.
I was having some iced tea.
Want some?
Yes.
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
Sam, let's go in here for a minute.
Sit down, sweetheart.
Yeah, right there.
Did you wanna talk to me about something?
- Yes, your birthday.
- My birthday?
What do wanna talk to me about that for?
It's a normal thing for a man to wanna know about his wife.
- You know when it is.
- I know.
- But when is it?
- It's in June.
- June what?
- The 6th.
That's kind of a nice day for a birthday.
June 6th, what?
- What do you mean?
- I mean, how old are you?
- How old do I look?
- Come on, Sam.
I'm serious.
I know you are, darling.
Why don't I fix dinner.
You must be starving.
At 4:00 in the afternoon?
Look, Sam, I know women don't like to talk about their birthdays but tell me approximately.
- Twenty-two?
- Older.
Twenty-four?
Darrin, I don't think we should continue with this conversation.
You know, Sam, you don't look a day older than the day we met.
If anything, you look younger.
Thank you, darling.
That's sweet of you to say so.
I didn't mean it as a compliment.
How do I know you are any older?
Are you?
Well, yes.
A little older.
After all, we met a year ago.
What are you going to look like when I'm 75?
I don't know, Darrin, how should?
You're going to look just the way you are now, aren't you?
Well You're going to help me up and down the stairs and bring me warm milk when I go to bed.
Darrin, I know you don't like warm milk.
How do you know what I'll like when I'm 75?
I'm going to change.
How do I know you'll feel the same toward me?
Well, of course I'll feel the same toward you.
Sure you can say that now, but wait 40 or 50 years.
I'll be bald, I won't have any teeth and Sam, what will people think when they see us together?
That you've got the youngest wife on the block.
Isn't that marvellous?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to do some gardening.
Well, spatting again, were you?
No, Mother.
It's just that he's finally asked me that question.
And what question is that, dear?
He asked to know my age.
Now that he suspects the truth, what are going to do about it?
I don't know.
But just remember dear, with us, aging is a process requiring centuries.
With humans, it occurs practically overnight.
Their bodies are just not equipped to handle such rapid transformation.
Just wait until you see it happen to Darius.
- See what happen?
- Senility.
Feebleness.
Mother, if there's one thing I know about Darrin it's that he's strong and is in perfectly good health.
You'll see.
Hi, Mr. Stephens.
Oh, hi, Kimmie.
What's the matter?
I've probably got too much of a load.
I'll get a box from the garage, take some of them out.
- Mr. Stephens?
- Yes, Kimmie.
Where did you want it?
Right there will be fine.
That'll be just fine.
You're kind of strong for a little girl, aren't you?
About normal, I guess.
- Bye.
- Goodbye, Kimmie.
Thanks.
Darrin, what happened?
That kid hit me.
Got me a pretty good shot too.
- It's just a little newspaper.
- But it had a lot of velocity.
Besides, he could have hit me in my bad leg.
- Bad leg?
- Yeah, I hurt it playing football.
It's been acting up lately.
Probably just a little touch of rheumatism.
Darrin, I've always thought of you as the picture of health.
On the surface, yes, but inside, underneath That was Louise Tate on the phone.
She asked us over for bridge.
- You're going to bed already?
- I've gotta get my rest.
- I haven't been feeling too well lately.
- Yes, I'm beginning to notice that.
May not be anything serious at all.
Then again Darrin, don't you think you're carrying this thing a little bit too far.
Easy for you to say.
You don't know what it's like to get older and the body doesn't stand up the way it used to.
Warm milk.
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, darling.
- Morning, Mr. Stephens.
- Where you off to?
I thought I'd deliver these sketches for you.
You needn't bother.
You ought to let the young blood take care of this sort of thing.
You have more important things to do.
Maybe you're right, Eddy.
Hi, Larry.
- Well, good morning, Darrin.
- Good morning, Larry.
You know, old friend, you're not looking well.
- I wish you wouldn't call me that.
- Call you what?
Mr. Tate, Miss Crampton from the model agency is here.
Oh, thank you.
Tell her I'll be with her in a few minutes.
Don't shut the door, Miss Blanding.
It's getting stuffy here.
Yes, sir.
Larry, how do you feel about younger women?
I think they're just fine.
I'll do even better than that.
I'll say they're great.
Is Louise younger than you?
I don't know.
She says she is.
I think Louise is a fine woman, Larry.
I don't think you should go tearing her down.
Well, who's tearing her down?
Probably just because she's beginning to look a little older.
Louise is no spring chicken, but it doesn't mean I think a woman as old Louise should look her age.
It's dignified.
Wait a minute.
She's not all that old.
I think we'd be hypocrites if we didn't admit we preferred younger women.
You approve of marriage between an older man and a younger woman?
Why, yes.
I mean, it all depends.
Darrin, what on earth are you getting at?
- Suppose he was really older?
- How much older?
Oh, say, 50 years.
A marriage between a 75-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman?
Darrin, that strikes me as indecent.
That's the way it strikes me too.
Darrin, what's bothering you?
I'm afraid you just wouldn't understand, Larry.
Well If you feel that way about it.
Glad you came to me about this Darrin.
I mean, that's what friends are for, to confide in each other.
- Well, what is it this time?
- Well, you see, Dave, it's like this They say the first six months are the roughest in any marriage.
I think Samantha is older than I am.
Kind of a period of adjustment, during which the man and woman have to kind of get to know and understand each other.
- A lot older.
- Little faults.
Little habits.
Maybe 200 or 300 years older.
The likes, the little dislikes.
Like if one prefers Scotch.
There may be advantages being married to an older woman like if you had trouble with historical dates.
But once over the hurdle, once true love has withstood the test smooth sailing.
Like the Revolutionary War.
You could just go to her and ask.
- I got an appointment.
- Thanks, Dave.
Any time, old boy, any time.
"Old boy".
I didn't come here about myself, doc.
It's Samantha.
I need some advice.
I didn't know who else to turn to.
Well, I'm flattered, Darrin, that you should come to me.
What is it?
Isn't Samantha feeling well?
That's just it.
She's abnormally well for a woman who might be several centuries old.
On second thought, I think I'd better examine you.
Take off your shirt.
Pete, what do you do when you find out your wife's a witch?
A very old witch.
You do just like I done, pal.
I mean, you just gotta learn to live with it.
How do you know what I'll like when I'm 75?
I'm going to change.
How do I know you'll feel the same?
Of course I'll feel the same toward you.
Wait 40 or 50 years.
I'll be bald, I won't have any teeth.
Sam, what will people think when they see us?
That you've got the youngest wife on the block.
Wait, please don't go.
I was talking to the squirrels.
Up in the tree there.
Quadramus-invecta-expedia - You wanted to see me, dear?
- Yes, Mother.
Where have you been?
Oh, I was out supplying two dear little squirrels with a nest full of nuts.
You've seen this before?
Can't see that I have, but it is quite a remarkable likeness.
Yes, isn't it?
- This is your doing.
- Surely you wouldn't think your You needn't deny it.
I recognise your touch.
Well It was just a little game.
- Innocent, harmless.
- No, it wasn't harmless.
You filled Darrin's head with doubts and suspicions.
He'll have to know eventually.
I'm doing it for your own good.
Later on, it would be more difficult.
All right, Mother.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
Oh, how touching.
But then when you consider how self-centred they are and selfish well, he'd never adjust to it, to growing old and you staying young.
I'm going to tell him.
Splendid.
Mother will be waiting.
That car's been parked in that two-hour zone all afternoon.
Maybe we better check it out.
Car 63.
I need to make on a 1965 convertible.
License number 4R6558.
- Hello?
- Hello, Samantha?
This is Larry Tate.
Oh, hi, Larry.
- May I speak to Darrin?
- No, he hasn't come home yet.
Strange.
He never came back after lunch today.
Where do you suppose he could be?
There's nothing to worry about.
Have you checked all the hospitals?
Hospitals?
Larry, you don't think anything could've happened to him?
No, it's just that a hospital is the first place you check when someone's missing.
Oh, I'm sure he's just out shopping or something.
Samantha, you know I'm not in the habit of prying into people's private lives.
Of course you aren't, Larry.
Whose private lives?
I was just wondering, is everything all right with you and Darrin?
Oh, yes, of course.
Why do you ask that?
Well, it's just that Darrin was acting very peculiar this morning.
Like he'd lost his best friend.
Not only that, he's got a cockamamie notion he's Methuselah or something.
Well, he didn't sleep very well last night.
I think he's just tired.
I'll have him call you when he comes home.
Bye.
- Hello?
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes.
- Is your husband at home?
- Who is this?
- Officer Kern, police department.
Police?
What is it?
Why do you want my husband?
Just a routine check, Mrs. Stephens.
His car's been in two-hour parking zone at Westbridge Avenue Park all afternoon.
- Westbridge Avenue Park?
- Yes, ma'am.
Mrs. Stephens, if you'd like us to have a look around for him, why - Yes.
Yes, I would.
- Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Do you remember, Henry, the first time we came here?
We'd just been married.
- Seems like yesterday.
- Yes.
And do you know, Henry, you haven't changed a particle in all these years.
- And you're still my bride, Agatha.
- Thank you, Henry.
Darrin, I've been worried about you.
I'm sorry, Sam.
I meant to call.
I don't know where the time went.
How did you know where I was?
Policemen phoned, they found your car.
What are you doing here?
I just wanted to be someplace where I could be alone, think things out.
I found the picture in the closet.
Darrin No, Sam, there's something I have to tell you.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
It wasn't easy, but I've come to a decision.
I love you, and that's all that matters.
Do you really mean that?
When two people love each other the only thing that's important is to be together.
Young or old, you'll always be the same to me.
Oh, Darrin, I love you so much.
Besides, what's wrong with people thinking I have the youngest wife on the block?
- Excuse me, is your name Stephens?
- Yes.
- Mr. Darrin Stephens?
- Why, yes.
Look, pal, why don't you go home to your wife.
This is my wife.
I talked to your wife on the phone not two minutes ago all the way across town.
I suppose you're gonna try to tell us she flew here.
Well, l You see Why don't you just drop the little lady off and go on home.
Anything you say, officer.
Can you beat a guy like that?
Probably got a nice wife at home too.
- True.
True.
- True.
The other things wouldn't have been so bad if it hadn't been for the squirrels.
The squirrels?
You won't believe this, but I thought I heard them talking to each other.
Oh, well.
- Mother.
- Did you say something, honey?
Nothing, darling.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- Good afternoon, Mr. Kravitz.
- Oh, good morning.
- Is it afternoon already?
- Why, yes.
I've been standing here all morning waiting to cross.
- You're exaggerating.
- A little, not much.
- Hi, Dave.
- Hello, Samantha.
Oh, hello, counsellor.
Hello, Mr. Kravitz.
How's the most beautiful woman in Morning Glory Circle?
- Tell me, Dave do girls really fall for that line?
- Usually.
- How's that lucky husband of yours?
- Very busy.
I am too, but I won't be for long if I keep important clients waiting.
Wait a minute.
You're not gonna try and cross now.
You think a fast man like me is going to be stopped by a few slow cars?
- What's happened here?
- It's a miracle I wasn't killed.
We have been asking for a stoplight on this corner for months.
Why haven't we gotten one?
That's not up to me, lady, that's up to city hall.
- Go fight city hall.
- Well, I think we should.
I do too, and soon.
Why don't we meet at my house tonight and discuss it?
- Fine, what time?
- Eight o'clock.
- We'll be there.
- We?
You do want Darrin too, don't you?
- Only if you insist.
- I insist.
- I'll be there too.
- With Mrs. Kravitz?
Only if you insist.
Oh, didn't I teach you never to play with sharp objects?
I'm not playing, Mother.
I'm working.
Much simpler that way, my dear.
Not in a long run.
You know Darrin doesn't like me doing things that way.
I'm surprised he doesn't insist you tear it apart with your fangs.
You promised not to criticise him.
Oh, perish the thought.
It was just an observation, not a criticism.
Why are you dining so early, Samantha?
Darrin's working, and I have to be at a neighbour's for a meeting.
- Why?
- We're trying to figure out how to get a traffic signal in Morning Glory Circle.
Is that all?
That's plenty.
Getting a traffic signal installed is a very difficult thing.
Not to me, it isn't.
I'll get some traffic signals from little cities.
I'll bring them here, you pick out one that appeals to you and I'll put it in Morning Glory Circle quicker than you can say "Beelzebub".
No, thank you, Mother.
Oh, I wish you'd let me help you in little ways, Samantha.
What's a mother for?
All right, we're all agreed.
We've got to do something dramatic to show city hall we want some action.
I say we should lie down right in the middle of the street.
You lie down in the middle of the street.
The traffic's too heavy for me.
I'm afraid, Mrs. Kravitz, that's illegal.
We could get arrested.
We could get killed.
When I said dramatic, Mrs. Kravitz, I didn't mean we could go quite that far.
Why don't we hold a protest meeting in the school auditorium?
That is a great idea, Samantha.
We could hold it, let's see, a week from Saturday.
Why wait a week?
Time's important.
Yes, it's very important.
But it's also important to get a maximum turnout.
We have to advertise, take an ad in the Morning Glory News and we couldn't get one up on such short notice.
I'll bet Darrin could help.
He's always being called on to do the impossible.
Is Darrin interested in what we're doing?
He isn't here.
I know, Dave.
He had to work late, but I'm sure he's very interested.
Excuse me.
- Well.
- Hi, Dave.
- Sorry I'm late.
- Come on in.
Come on in.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
- You all know my husband, Darrin.
- Hello there.
- Glad you could join us, Darrin.
- I wouldn't have missed it for the world.
We were talking about an ad for the Morning Glory News.
- I told them you'd be glad to help us.
- Well, of course.
I'd be delighted.
We're worried about meeting a deadline.
I don't think there'll be a problem.
When's the deadline?
- Tomorrow morning.
- Tomorrow morning?
That's not impossible, is it?
- No, I think I can handle it.
- See.
Now, next to having a big turnout at the rally the most important thing is to make its existence known to city hall.
I'm going to see about getting the mayor to attend.
Last is the appointment of the chairman of the refreshments committee.
- Any volunteers?
- I'll volunteer if someone will lend me some cookie cutters.
I have some.
Well, the meeting's adjourned.
Are you sure you can prepare an ad by 8:00 tomorrow morning, Darrin?
Of course.
It's not a legal brief.
- I hope it doesn't keep you up all night.
- It won't.
- Okay.
Good night then.
- Good night.
Good night, Dave.
- Hi there.
- Hi.
That was delicious.
What's for dessert?
- You just had it.
- That little piece of pie?
I'll get you another piece.
I better go get Mrs. Stephens' cookie cutters.
What's your hurry?
Are you planning to start baking tonight?
Can you think of anything more exciting to do?
- Besides, never put off until tomorrow - What you don't have to do at all.
Yeah.
Mother, what have you done?
I didn't know which one you'd prefer, so I brought an assortment.
This is "walk" and "don't walk," prevents jaywalking.
It's against the law, you know.
This is the red, green and yellow.
Prismatic colours.
It's fairly attractive.
This is conventional red-and-green light.
Rather ordinaire.
Abner!
Oh, this is my favourite.
It's old-fashioned.
It's like that plaything you used to have, monkey on a stick.
I must say, its removal created a rather monumental traffic snarl.
Put them all back, Mother.
- AII?
- AII.
Why should I do that?
You've heard the expression "easy come, easy go".
When we finally do get a stoplight at that intersection I would like it to stay.
Well, all right, Samantha.
I'll take them all back, eventually.
- Now, please.
- Tonight?
Tonight.
Oh, I had a lot of things planned for tonight.
Well, I'm sorry, Mother, but this has to come first.
Oh, Samantha sometimes I think you take after your father.
Thank you, Mother.
- We'll be arrested for trespassing.
- We're not the ones who'll be arrested.
Look.
Look.
Yeah, very pretty.
But I know I saw them.
Lights flashing red, green, yellow.
"Walk, don't walk, stop".
Here you are.
Thanks.
- Something wrong?
- Yes, that's wrong.
- The ad?
- Yes, I slave over ads all day.
When I come home at night, I like food, relaxation.
- I know.
- Then why am I sitting here?
You volunteered.
I'd just as soon you'd kept your nose out of that traffic-signal business.
I cross at that corner several times a week.
Why can't you fly across?
Because I have a husband who doesn't like me behaving like a witch.
Samantha.
Samantha.
Samantha, open the door.
- Samantha, will you please open up?
- Why?
Will you please stop playing games?
- Will you start work on that ad?
- I'm not in the mood.
I know, but you have to finish it by morning.
It's very important.
I promise I'll get up bright and early and tackle it fresh.
You seem fresh enough to me right now.
- Get to work.
- Sam.
Whistle when you're through, and I'll unlock the door.
Honey I said, after you're through.
Yes, warden.
Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- What time is it?
- Eight.
What time did you finish?
- Seven-thirty.
- You've been up all night?
Yeah, but don't tell Dave.
Let him think I'm a genius.
Come on over here, honey.
Take a look at this.
- Well, what do you think?
- Well, I think you are a genius.
It's beautiful.
- But is it effective?
- Oh, it's very effective.
If this doesn't get people to our rally, I don't know what will.
- But I'm sorry you didn't get any sleep.
- So am I. - That must be Dave.
- Oh, I'll get it, honey.
Do I look like I've been up all night?
You look beautiful when you've been up all night.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Dave.
- Were you able to finish?
- Naturally.
Come on in.
- Hey, it must've taken you all night.
- Are you kidding?
- Good morning.
- Morning.
You look beautiful.
You look terrible.
Forget about that.
Look at the ad.
Looks like we're gonna have our meeting Saturday.
I guess so.
This is just about right.
- I just have two little suggestions.
- Suggestions?
- I hope you don't mind.
- Oh, no.
Why should I mind?
What are your suggestions?
Well, the top line I think should read, "Stop risking your child's life".
What if the reader doesn't have a child?
That doesn't matter.
It's still a more effective headline, I think.
I think so too.
- I thought you liked my headline.
- Well, I do, darling.
But I think Dave's suggestion helps.
It's still basically your headline, Darrin.
Yes, that's right, darling.
It is yours, basically.
What's your other suggestion?
Under "Go to the mass rally at the school auditorium" you should add "and bring your friends".
I think that's an excellent idea, don't you, Darrin?
Suppose a person doesn't have any friends?
Oh, sweetheart, that's ridiculous.
Who doesn't have any friends?
Me.
Darrin, I want you - Darrin.
- It's all finished, Dave.
Dave?
Wake up.
You're dreaming.
- Oh, Larry, I'm sorry.
- Well, you should be.
I realise Sleggershammer's Dairy isn't the most stimulating account but it does butter our bread.
With "the richest butter this side of Fort Knox".
Nevertheless, we can't afford to have you asleep in the middle of the campaign for their gala centennial.
- Larry, I've been moonlighting.
- You have another job?
Yes.
I'm in charge of advertising for the Put a Traffic Signal in Morning Glory Circle Committee.
- My condolences.
- What makes you think I'll need them?
I once had a similar position.
We lived near a busy intersection, and Louise was very anxious to get a traffic light installed there.
- What happened?
Well, we have a traffic light on our corner now.
- How'd you do it?
- We moved.
I caught you.
- Who am I, Jesse James?
- Those cookies are for the rally.
- I'll eat now and go later.
- No.
- You can go with me to Mrs. Stephens'.
- What for?
- To return the cookie cutters.
- Oh, that's not a man's job.
Okay.
Do I have your word that you won't take any while I'm gone?
It's yours.
Now, Abner, a man shouldn't give his word lightly.
- A man's word should be his bond.
- You got my bonds too.
Mrs. Stephens.
- Oh, yes, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Here are your cookie cutters.
Thank you.
Won't you come in for a minute?
Oh, no.
Abner, my husband, Mr. Kravitz he's waiting for me.
- Oh, fine.
Thank you again.
- You're welcome.
See you at the rally.
- Yeah.
Excuse me, I'm Mrs. Stephens.
Can I do?
Abner!
All right, Mother.
What's all this about?
- How did you know I was behind this?
- I'm psychic.
It's really quite simple.
I happened to notice this gentleman doing a rather exemplary job of directing traffic in Trafalgar Square.
So I thought I'd surprise you with him.
Don't think me ungrateful, but what am I going to do with him?
Put him in the middle of the intersection, of course.
He'd give a touch of divine elegance to a somewhat dreary little community.
What happens when he's removed from the state of suspended animation?
- Oh, it should be glorious to behold.
- Take him back, Mother.
Oh, Samantha, in London he's just another pea in a pod but here, he'd be the talk of Morning Glory Circle.
So will I if you don't stop all this.
Oh, Samantha, there must be some way I can be of help.
I believe there is, at the rally.
All right, ducky, back to Trafalgar Square.
What would a bobby be doing in Mrs. Stephens' house?
That's what I'd like to know.
Now go ahead and look.
Look.
Here, Gladys, have a cookie.
You've been working too hard.
And so I trust that you understand why it's impossible to approve your request for a traffic signal.
Now, although I must dash off to a very important meeting I'll stay long enough to answer a few questions.
Young lady in the second row.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you say that if there were enough accidents at that intersection that the city then would install a traffic signal?
I thought I made myself clear.
I said that when the accident experience at any intersection is such that a signal is warranted, a signal will be installed.
Does someone have to get killed before that happens?
My friend, on my way here tonight I had to cross the intersection in question.
Frankly, it lacks sufficient vehicular volume to justify the expenditure of a traffic signal.
This gentleman has a question.
I have a statement, Your Honour.
Try to cross it when the men from the missile plant are driving to work.
You know what their motto is?
"Thou shall not pass".
You elected me mayor to do the right thing for all the people, didn't you?
Personally, I supported your opponent.
I assure you, good citizen my opponent and his rich wife, had he been elected would've been guided by the same rules that I was forced to apply today.
And now I really must go.
Thank you, and remember, feel free to call on me whenever I can be of any help to you.
I'm gonna go talk to the counsellor.
- We'll meet you out by the parking lot.
- Fine, darling.
Samantha.
The mayor isn't going anyplace for a while, Samantha.
Marvellous.
I'll take over from here.
- Have fun.
- I will.
- Pretty good turnout.
- There's Samantha.
- Are you coming with me?
- Hi.
I guess not.
See you later.
Need some help?
Yeah, but you don't look like a mechanic to me, lady.
Try that.
- I already did.
- Try it again.
Well, what good would that do?
Try it again, numbskull.
- Thank you very much, miss.
- Mrs. Stephens.
And this is my husband.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Your Honour, could you give us a lift?
- Lf I'm going your way.
- You are.
Well, good.
Hop in.
How long will this traffic keep up?
Sometimes it lasts for hours.
Well, give them the siren.
- The siren's broken, Your Honour.
- Well, blow the horn.
- You know what we need on this corner?
- What?
A traffic light.
Good.
Can I be of any help, Sam?
Yes, don't eat any more hors d'oeuvres till the company arrives.
And get out some ice.
Mother.
Oh, isn't it adorable?
I just couldn't resist it.
Oh, well, Samantha, but when I heard you were giving a victory party I thought it would be appropriate to bring it along.
A sort of guest of honour, you know?
I know, but I don't think the other guests will understand.
I told you so.
There's someone now.
Mother, please.
Oh, Samantha, you do have an annoying way of putting a damper on my divertissements.
- Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz, Mr. Kravitz.
- Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
- Good evening, Mrs. Stephens.
- I see we're not the first to arrive.
Look again.
I wasn't Didn't you see?
Well, I saw But there was a traffic light right there and also, there was a woman sitting there - Didn't you see?
- Gladys, take your medicine.
Gladly.
Excuse me.
Again.
Again, Gladys.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Where are you off to in such a hurry?
Shopping.
It's Dollar Day.
- Is that good?
- Marvellous.
Everything's on sale.
You can pick up some terrific bargains.
I suspected David wasn't doing so well.
Darrin, and he's doing just fine.
Bargain hunting's a challenge.
It's fun.
It's a great pleasure for mortal women.
Poor dears.
If you're not doing anything, why don't you come along.
- We can have lunch.
- Well, it might be interesting to see how the other half amuse themselves.
- Do you like it?
- Very nice.
This, darling, is what I call a real bargain.
- Costs nothing.
- Try it my way, Mother.
It's the challenge of the thing.
You'll see.
I saw it first.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
It's not my colour anyway.
- All by yourself?
- Oh, no.
Well, Mother's around here somewhere.
Well, happy hunting.
Look, Samantha.
Ninety percent off, over there.
- Mother.
- I should've thought of that 30 minutes ago.
- How about this one?
Oh, Samantha, it's dull.
You've grown so conservative.
Well, it's reduced from 12.95 to 6.99.
That's a saving of Five dollars and 96 cents, and so what?
So what?
I can enjoy another mortal pleasure.
When you've saved enough on bargains, you're entitled to splurge.
Now, that's really fun.
- I'll never make it.
- Make what?
I have a fitting upstairs this afternoon.
I can't do that and the marketing too.
And the chops are on special.
I'd love to help you Samantha.
Chops.
Butcher haggling just doesn't appeal to me.
But I could fill in on the dress fitting, though.
- You don't mean - I do.
Oh, Mother, you wouldn't.
I mean, you couldn't, not here in front of all these people.
You know how subtle I can be.
Well, what do you think?
I think my voice has changed.
Not even your dressmaker will know for sure.
- Is that better?
- Much.
Where do I go?
Fourth floor.
Here we are.
Helen.
Excuse me, do you have the time?
- One-thirty.
- Oh, that's exactly what I have.
May I buy you a drink to celebrate?
You should be ashamed of yourself, sonny.
I saw the whole thing.
- What?
- I saw the whole thing, Mrs. Stephens.
Honestly, the nerve of some people.
Well, did you find your mother?
- Yes, I know exactly where she is.
- Good.
I'd like to meet her sometime.
Really?
That would be a thrill for you.
She's marvellous.
- A thoroughly fascinating woman.
- I guess.
Bye.
Well, hello there.
- Hello.
- How've you been?
Just fine.
And you?
Only fair, but now that I've met you things are bound to get a whole lot better.
My name is Bob Frazer.
Robert E. Frazer Jr. - I think I just met senior.
- Oh, yeah.
- How is old Ed?
- His watch works.
Otherwise he's a little rusty.
Crude too, I bet.
Probably offered to buy you a drink right off.
Of course, I would've said no even if I hadn't been going for a dress fitting.
I'm terribly embarrassed.
I favour my mother's side of the family.
Perhaps after your fitting, I could buy you a cup of tea to make amends.
- Hello.
- You're under arrest for not reading my latest novel.
- Bob, where you been?
I thought you'd drop by the minute you hit town.
My publisher had other ideas.
I'm stuck here at Bridon's department store autographing books.
Say no more.
And you met this beautiful young thing you're not coming by, right?
Affirmative, but don't fret.
If she has a friend, I'll fix you up.
Thanks, but I don't think my wife would approve.
You took the plunge, poor old buddy?
Affirmative, and I want you to meet her.
Dinner tomorrow night?
Well, can I call you?
If I have any luck with this girl, not until Friday.
Well, make it any time at all.
And bring her along.
- Thanks, old buddy.
Talk to you.
- Bye.
Oh, it's stunning.
Stunning.
- You really think so?
- Oh, yes.
I only wish I had your figure.
So do I. But the back, it's so conservative.
Well, I don't know.
I suppose it could be lowered a smidgen.
I think that would help.
And why don't we lower the front.
Say, two smidgens?
I'll get the seamstress.
I'm glad you're not one of these women who dress for other women.
I take it you're a two-smidgen man.
I haven't found a thing, but I see you have.
Yes, and I wasn't looking.
- She a friend of yours?
- I hope not.
You're my kind of girl.
I may pattern the heroine of my next book after you.
- You're a writer?
- You sound like my publisher.
I write historical romances which the clever public ignores.
Careful, I may present you with an autographed copy of Helen of Troy.
Oh, I read that.
Oh, well, I hope you won't hold it against me.
It was very amusing.
Of course, Helen was nothing like that.
She had a face that would've sunk ships, not launched them.
And knock-kneed.
You must've loved studying history.
Living it was more fun.
Yes?
Well Well, perhaps you could help me with my research.
How are you on the Borgias?
The things I could tell you about Lucrezia.
Well, I wish you would.
Let's have dinner and talk about it.
Well, why not.
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetheart.
How are you?
Fine.
You sound like you're working and won't be home for dinner.
No, I'll be there.
I called to tell you I got in touch with Bob Frazer.
- Do I know him?
- He's the writer, my old buddy.
- You remember, I told you about him.
- Oh, yes.
When he hit town, he got involved with a raving beauty.
I asked him to bring her along, but he had other ideas.
Good, the last thing we need in this house is a raving beauty.
Correction, my love: Another raving beauty.
That's sweet.
I tried to get in touch with you earlier.
Where were you?
I was shopping for bargains with Mother.
Mother.
Oh, that sounds like fun.
As a matter of fact, it was.
She's been very helpful and sweet lately.
Wonderful hands, Samantha.
And the longest lifeline I've ever seen.
It runs in the family.
- You should see my mother's.
- Shall we drink to her?
Well, why don't we.
She's a marvellous woman.
You're quite a woman, Samantha.
You combine the wisdom of the ages with all that's modern and swinging.
If you're ever up against it, Bobby, you can always write fortune cookies.
Abner.
Now, don't blame me.
My cookie said to be more affectionate.
Mine says, "Beware of chance meetings".
- Hello?
- Hi, sweetheart.
Bob just called.
He can't make it to dinner.
- Why not?
- He and this new girlfriend made a killing at the track.
They're going out to celebrate.
She's sensational.
Sensational-Iooking?
- I don't know, I haven't seen her.
- But you think she's sensational?
Bob's been raving about her.
Besides, she sounds like my type.
Blond hair, green eyes, crazy turned-up nose.
- Sounds like me.
- Exactly, that's my type.
- I'll see you tonight.
- Bye, sweetheart.
Guess who, darling.
- Stop that.
What are you doing?
- Oh, sorry, wrong ear.
Say, what's the matter, honey?
Did you get out of bed on the wrong side?
Which side of the bed I get out on is nobody's business but my husband's.
- Your who?
- My husband's.
If you don't leave me alone, I'll report you to management.
You didn't tell me you were married.
Not that it would've made a difference, but you should've told me, Samantha.
You know me?
Well, I thought I did.
I thought I knew all week, ever since we met here a few days ago.
- We met here?
- Yes.
You were trying on that marvellous dress with the Don't you think you ought to explain a little?
Well, you see If you did know me, it wasn't me you knew.
Darling, that doesn't make any sense.
Yes, I I could explain all this to you, but it would just be even more confusing.
Let's just pretend it never happened.
Goodbye.
Wait!
Samantha!
Mother?
Mother, I want to talk to you.
What can I do for you, dear?
For a start, you can stop being me.
Well, l Whatever do you mean?
Never mind the innocent act.
Your boyfriend just nuzzled both my ears.
Oh, he is an affectionate rascal.
Mother, how could you?
Oh, it was easy.
And we did start out to have such a nice rapport.
Well, it's over.
A thing like this could lead to complications.
Besides, it isn't fair to him.
Mortals are very vulnerable.
Now, I want your promise that you'll never see him again.
- But we have a lunch date.
- Mother.
Well, I wouldn't have to eat.
I could just say goodbye.
No, Mother.
Absolutely not.
Well, I don't see any harm in a simple, "Goodbye, Bobby Frazer.
It's been fun".
Bob Frazer!
I call him Bobby.
He's a writer.
Have you heard of him?
Heard of him?
He's a friend of Darrin's.
Oh, dear.
That's a bit of sticky wicket, isn't it?
Sticky?
Oh, Mother, how could you have picked him of all people?
I didn't pick him.
He picked me.
I mean you, or us.
He's coming here for dinner tonight.
I could phone him and discourage him.
He doesn't discourage easily, dear.
- Did you tell him you were married?
- Yes.
Well, it helps.
Helps what?
I'll simply keep my lunch date with him and tell him I love my husband.
Or your husband, that is.
He'll behave himself.
- You think it'll work?
- It'll have to.
Unless you have a better idea.
- Only one.
- What's that?
Murder.
I was afraid after that incident in the store this morning you wouldn't come.
- What incident?
- When I kissed you on the ear.
How sweet.
At the time, you didn't think so.
I'm very unpredictable.
Don't let it bother you.
Bother me?
It's driving me crazy.
Bobby, there's something I have to say.
Oh, this business about your husband again?
Yes.
Darling, we're adults.
You don't have to draw me a picture.
I've written this scene a hundred times.
- I doubt it.
- Your marriage didn't work out.
You don't know what you saw in him.
You didn't want to tell me.
You were afraid how I'd take it.
Now, isn't that true?
Not exactly.
Now, please, don't feel guilty.
We've just had four marvellous days together.
Tonight, I'll introduce you to Darrin Stephens.
I'm dying for you two to meet.
- Oh, I'll be there.
- Good.
With Darrin.
He's my husband.
Boy, there's a weird echo in this place.
I thought you said Darrin was your husband.
I did.
Ours is just an innocent little flirtation, but it's gone far enough.
I only kept this luncheon date to explain things and urge you not to mention any of this to my husband.
- On one condition.
- Anything.
Look me in the eyes and tell me that Darrin Stephens is the most wonderful man in the world.
Please, not while I'm eating.
Could you rephrase that?
Tell me I don't mean anything to you, that you love him.
- Who?
- Your husband.
- Must I?
- "I love Darrin Stephens".
Say it.
I Iove Darrin Stephens.
Not very convincing.
Promise you won't say anything tonight.
Not a word.
- Abner, come here.
- What is it?
That man, he's at their front door with flowers.
Well, maybe he's a florist.
Honey, you're gonna love this guy.
- Hi, old buddy.
- Bob!
- I finally made it.
- Well, come on in, come on in.
Gee, it's good to see you.
I'd like you to meet my wife.
Sam, Bob.
Bob, Sam.
It's funny, I feel like I already know you.
Oh, how nice.
Excuse me.
I think I'll go put these in water.
How about a drink?
- We've got catching up to do.
- Yeah, I'll say.
How would you feel if I invited one of my boyfriends to dinner?
Fine, just make sure he can play pinochle.
What do you think of her?
Isn't she something?
She certainly is.
Darrin, I promised I wouldn't do this but it's important.
I've got to talk to you privately.
Well, talk.
Oh, well, I don't quite know how to say it.
I guess the best thing is to come out with it.
The girl I met the one I was telling you about?
- Yeah.
- I think I'm falling in love with her.
- Well, Bob, that's wonderful.
Yes, but the problem is, she's married.
That makes it rough.
Worse yet, I know her husband.
Oh, he's a great guy.
- Does he know what's been going on?
- No.
- I think I should tell him.
Don't you?
- By all means.
Oh, I'm so glad you feel this way, Darrin.
You see, the girl I'm in love with is Samantha, so So I'm telling you.
What's so funny?
You are, you dog.
You haven't changed a bit.
You're still pulling the same old corny practical jokes.
I'm not joking.
I've been dating your wife all week.
That's great, I hope you enjoyed it.
Honey, why didn't you tell me about you and Bob?
- He told you?
- I'm sorry, darling, I had to.
- Darling?
- Darrin, I'll explain later.
You'll explain now.
- Don't bully her.
- Stay out of this!
It wasn't Bob's fault, it was Mother's.
Nobody thinks less of your mother than I do, but don't hang this on her.
- How did your mother?
- Why don't you shut up.
- With magic.
- I think we better talk.
Come on, this way.
Excuse us.
All right, explain yourself.
- You won't like it, Darrin.
- I want the whole story, straight.
I had to be in two places at once so Mother volunteered to double for me.
That's when she met Bob.
She met Bob?
Then it really is Endora?
- Afraid so, darling.
- This is ridiculous.
How am I going to tell him he's fallen in love with my mother-in-law?
Well did you decide anything?
Bob, it's all straightened out.
You mind telling me how?
After all, I got a pretty important stake in this.
Well, it was all a joke.
A joke?
What was so funny about Staten Island?
- Staten Island?
- I wouldn't know.
Oh, well, then who would?
I would, Bobby.
Talk about putting somebody on.
Identical twins.
I should've guessed.
Of course you should.
Anyone can see I'm much prettier.
I better start dinner.
Need help?
Thanks.
Oh, I've got to hand it to you, old buddy.
When you arrange a double date, you really arrange a double date.
Goodbye, Darrin, it's been great.
Thanks a lot for dinner.
- Well, come again, any time.
- Well, how about tomorrow?
That's not such a good idea.
No, tomorrow is bad for us.
Me too.
I'm flying up to Boston in the morning.
He flies too.
Isn't that marvellous?
Good night.
Donald.
They're leaving together.
- Who?
- Mrs. Stephens and that man.
It's one thing to neck in a restaurant but when she brings it into her home - Gladys, will you stop?
- That woman is shameless.
- I'm gonna do something.
- I'm going to bed.
If I ran around like that, wouldn't you want to be told?
Yes, and soon.
I've known Bob since college, and I've never seen him fall like that.
I guess she's his type.
Did your mother promise to give up her masquerade?
- Can you trust her?
- She gave me her solemn oath.
I just hope it doesn't break Bob's heart.
He'll get over it.
Mr. Stephens, your wife has Your wife.
Your wife.
Your wife.
I guess it was nothing important.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
- Darrin - I can't stop now, honey, I'm late.
- But, sweetheart - Martins is due at 9:00.
After that I got the Phillips meeting.
- But, Darrin - Friday's always a frantic day.
It isn't Friday.
It's Saturday.
You can sleep as late as you like.
Oh, boy.
Must've set it by mistake.
Oh, good morning.
Good morning.
- And it's such a lovely one, isn't it?
- Lovely.
My, aren't I fortunate to have such a handsome man for a next-door neighbour.
See anything interesting?
Interesting?
Oh, I don't know if "interesting" is the right word.
I'd certainly call her attractive.
Wouldn't you?
You might even say that she was beautiful.
I mean, for that type of girl.
I mean, she can't help being stunning, can she?
I mean, in that outfit.
With that long hair down her back.
I was talking about the newspaper.
I'll get it, sweetheart.
Hello.
Oh, good morning, Marty.
Ten-thirty at the club, can I make it?
- You can make it.
- I can make it if I hang up right now.
You don't mind?
We'll only play 18.
Besides, two of the foursome, Hyler and McNeal could mean new business for the agency.
Never need explain to an adoring golf widow.
Besides, I've got closets to clean and that new neighbour to spy on.
Can't let Gladys Kravitz have all the fun.
Gladys, will you stay away from that window.
All right, so she's a Beautiful girl.
Wow, as the saying goes.
But why isn't her husband helping her?
Where is he?
She doesn't look like our kind of people.
She looks like my kind of people.
Thanks, pal.
Kind of knocked the wind out of me.
Oh, aren't you nice.
Thanks ever so much, Mr Good Samaritan.
Stephens, Darrin.
Welcome to Morning Glory Circle.
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.
Okay, there we go.
Alrighty.
Gee, look at all them trophies and medals and stuff.
She's a real winner.
"First prize for the most beautiful lips in Sheboygan presented to" Well, I'm terribly sorry I was so clumsy, Mrs?
Unfortunately, it's still Miss.
Miss Pleasure O'Riley.
Naturally, my real name, Priscilla, is so much more dignified.
But it all started when I was a baby.
I'd try to say Priscilla, but it would come out Pleasure.
Well, how do you like that?
So natch, Mummy and Daddy hung it on to me as a nickname.
And it sort of stuck, you know.
For some crazy reason photographers and all these beauty-contest people seemed to prefer to call me Pleasure.
Men especially.
Why fight it?
So now I use it as my pen name, you know.
Great for publicity, natch.
Natch.
Well, you know something, Mr. Stephens?
My manager has insured every single part of me.
Isn't that wild?
Excuse me.
Darrin, darling, you have exactly Assuming you're willing to tee off in your bathrobe.
Oh, boy.
Sam, I'd like you to meet our new neighbour, Pleasure O'Riley.
Pleasure O'Riley?
All the women react the same way, but I don't mind.
Hi there, Mrs. Stephens.
Be careful of my legs.
Your husband has been a living doll, a pillar of strength.
I'll bet he has.
Eagle Scout, you know.
You should see him sometimes helping little old ladies across the street.
Here's my new love seat.
No one to share it with me.
Miss O'Riley, I would think a beauty queen like you would have dozens of hopelessly smitten suitors flinging themselves at your feet and your throne.
Well, naturally, I've been engaged a few times.
I guess about 16.
And none of them was Mr. Right?
That may seem like a lot, but six of the engagements were to the same fellow.
Thor Swenson.
Not Thor "Thunderbolt" Swenson of the Pennsylvania Manglers, lady?
- The great offensive fullback?
- The very offensive fullback.
Now, you remember what you faithfully promised.
Not to tell absolutely no one your new address here.
- Not even Thor Swenson?
- Particularly Thor Swenson.
Don't you think you're being a little bit hard on that poor boy after being engaged to him six times?
You wouldn't say that, Mrs. Stephens if this insanely jealous, rotten, awful, terrible-tempered person just very recently threatened to kill you.
He did?
If he ever catches me alone with another man again: So naturally, all my boyfriends are scared to death.
He belted poor Roger and Curtis before they even opened their mouths.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, Mrs. Stephens, are you ever lucky to have such a sweet-tempered dream of a man for a hubby like Darrin.
Hold on to him.
I intend to.
Hey, how about that.
My favourite flowers.
My favourite vintage, Liebfraumilch '53, the best year.
- You expecting someone special?
- Yes, you.
What's this all about?
It's all about the fact that I suddenly remembered I love you very much and that this is the best year too.
Now, you tend to your business.
Open the Liebfraumilch and light the candles.
Hey, my favourite.
Turkey soup with extra-wide noodles.
How about that?
You advertising men.
You have such a way with a fresh phrase.
You're right, this is the best year.
You want this vintage love of mine or your hot turkey soup?
That is a tough choice to make.
What was that?
Sounded like a sonic boom.
Must be Pleasure O'Riley.
She's been dropping things like that all day.
It sounds to me like she's accident-prone.
It sounded to me like she could've fallen off of something.
Well, I wouldn't worry unduly, Darrin in view of the fact that all her parts are heavily insured.
She stands to make a fortune if she's broken anything.
Now, what kind of a crack is that, Sam?
That doesn't sound like you at all.
It doesn't?
How about that?
She could be lying there unconscious.
How could you tell?
But if it's going to worry you all through dinner you'd better run next door and check, hadn't you?
Abner.
Abner, come here quick.
Maybe he just wants to borrow a cup of sugar or a slice of cheesecake.
Miss O'Riley.
Miss O'Riley.
Miss O'Riley?
Miss O'Riley.
Oh, hi, Darrin.
Don't try to talk, just lie there.
What's the name of your doctor?
Paul Pinkus.
Do you need a doctor?
Just relax.
Don't move.
I think you're all right.
Just knocked the wind out of you, that's all.
- I don't want you to move.
- You don't?
Well, in case you broke anything.
- Only my lips, darn it.
- Your lips?
They rolled somewhere here under the couch when I fell off the ladder.
My statuette from Sheboygan.
- Well, how do you feel now?
- Fine.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
Oh, hi there, Mrs. Stephens.
She fell off the ladder.
When I got here, I thought she was unconscious.
Actually, I never lost consciousness, Mrs. Stephens.
But it was awfully sweet of your husband.
He's such a thoughtful man.
I think it happened accidentally when she was looking for her bust.
The one of her lips.
Well, look here.
All in one piece.
- How about that?
- Gee, how lucky can a girl get?
I mean, to have such wonderful, wonderful neighbours like you two next door to me to call on in case of an emergency.
Thanks ever so, Darrin.
And you too, Mrs. Stephens.
Boy, is that a relief.
For a minute, she looked completely unconscious.
So did you.
Come on, you could never be jealous of a girl like Pleasure O'Riley, could you?
I suppose.
If I tried.
Now, how would you like to wrap the most beautiful lips in advertising around some of those extra-wide noodles?
Mr. Stephens.
Hey, Mr. Stephens.
Darrin, are you awake?
Darrin.
Mr. Stephens.
Mr. Stephens.
Hey, Mr. Stephens.
Darrin.
Are you awake?
Darrin.
Hey, Mr. Stephens.
Samantha, what's going on?
The cheesecake queen wants to know if you can come out and play with her.
Pleasure?
I mean, Miss O'Riley?
Why?
- Darrin.
- Ask her.
She's paging you, not me.
Mr. Stephens.
Hey, Mr. Stephens.
Are you awake?
Should I get out your silk pyjamas, sir?
This looks like it's going to be a formal affair.
Good evening, Miss O'Riley.
Did you lock yourself out or something?
Oh, Darrin, thank goodness.
I hope I'm not disturbing you but I'm so frightened.
Of what?
The moving man told me the terrible news.
Thor Swenson made him tell him where I live.
Thor "Thunderbolt" Swenson, the Manglers' offensive fullback?
- Who else?
- Maybe one of the other 10 boys you've been engaged to.
- Oh, no, Mrs. Stephens.
Thunderbolt's the only one who cared enough to wanna come back and murder me.
Why would anyone want to murder you?
Because I won't go back to him.
I'll never go back to that big, insanely jealous brute because I hate him.
Darrin, I don't know what to do now.
I'm so frightened.
In that case, you better call the police.
I was going to, but my new telephone won't be installed until tomorrow.
I'm so scared.
We'll call from here.
I'll be right down.
We'll both be right down.
Abner.
Abner, come here.
Gladys, what can be so fascinating?
Take it easy.
Everything's going to be all right.
You can't trust anybody anymore.
I should've moved myself but all those things were so heavy.
I know.
Your gold cups alone weigh a ton.
- You think he'll come looking for you?
- I'm sure of it.
The moving man said he didn't give him the exact address.
But if I know Thunderbolt, he'll find me.
He always does.
Now, you just calm down.
Go home and lock your doors and windows while I call the police.
I'll see that she's locked in.
You better tell the law to hurry.
Hello?
I'm calling to prevent a murder.
I'm at 1123 Morning Glory Circle.
All right, all right, mister.
I've got the address.
- What's the name?
- Name?
Oh, Pleasure O'Riley.
Pleasure O'Riley?
Well, actually, that's a professional model's name.
The real name is Miss Priscilla O'Riley.
- Your name?
- No, my name is Darrin Stephens.
I'm her next-door neighbour.
She's the one in trouble.
Why isn't she making this call herself?
Because she just moved in today, she hasn't got a phone yet.
Could you send an officer over to investigate?
What?
What's the trouble?
Look, Mr. O'Riley, if you've been drinking Stephens.
As I told you at the beginning of this conversation this is an emergency.
Miss O'Riley could be in danger.
An ex-boyfriend has been making threats.
He's on his way over now.
Will you please send somebody?
We'll check it out as soon as we can.
What's his name?
Thunderbolt Swenson.
Thunderbolt Swenson?
I'll send somebody over right away.
If you see him before we get there would you ask him for an autograph for my kids?
He's here.
He's here.
That's the new car he got when he signed his new five-year contract.
Where are those policemen?
Oh, please don't let him in.
Here.
Hide all my trophies and take down that picture of me so Thunderbolt won't know I'm here.
Mrs. Stephens, what shall we do?
You shall get down off that ladder, and you will go in here and you shall be real quiet until I get rid of him.
But how?
By magic or something?
Yes?
Sorry, lady.
I guess I got the wrong house.
It appears you did.
Good night.
Wait, he said it was the first house on the right.
Does a beautiful girl live next door?
- You might say that.
- The most beautiful girl in the world?
I wouldn't go that far.
- Have you seen a man over there?
- Yes, indeed.
A very good-Iooking one.
I'll kill him.
Okay, lady Excuse me, grandma.
Grandma?
Who do you think you're talking to?
Maybe I'm mixed up, but doesn't Pleasure O'Riley live here?
- Who wants to know?
- They said the first house on the right as you turn into the street, that's next door.
Did it occur to you it might be on the left if you were coming from the opposite direction?
Yeah.
I didn't think about that.
Next time, get your directions straight before you wake people up at night.
- I'm sorry.
- You ought to be, you big bully.
Grandma?
- Samantha.
- I'm here, darling.
- Oh, my.
- Is this your idea of a joke?
Sorry, darling, but you do look sweet.
Another Whistler's Mother.
Never mind that.
Do something now!
Oh, all right, all right.
Don't get cranky.
Samantha, what am I gonna do with you?
I'm sorry, darling.
But I did it for your own good.
Besides, you make an adorable grandma.
Abner, Abner.
What could that noise be at this time of night?
There's only one way to find out.
- What is it?
- I've only got one question for you.
- Do you have Pleasure in this house?
- Not too often, but occasionally.
Gladys Kravitz, "passion's plaything".
How about that?
Morning Glory Circle will never be the same.
- Hi, Darrin.
- Hi.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Stephens.
Gee, I hope I'm not disturbing you.
No, not at all.
We were beginning to wonder where you were.
In that awful police court, although the judge couldn't have been sweeter.
- I must admit, I cried a little.
- Well, that must've helped.
- So did that outfit.
- Oh, do you like it?
I'm so glad, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, and, Darrin, hurray, hurray, our worries with Thunderbolt are all over.
My lawyer just got a court order.
So now he's gotta stay away from me.
But don't you still have And, Darrin, my insurance company's gonna pay for poor Mr. Kravitz's new bridgework.
And, Darrin, you wanna hear something wild?
So many newspaper photographers took pictures of me when I was on the stand that guess what.
I give up.
The mayor called me personally to offer me a contract to be Miss Urban Renewal.
Which reminds me, I've gotta get measured for my new civic-centre bikini.
Boy, I can't tell you two how much I appreciate last night.
Darrin, how can I ever repay you?
You don't owe him a thing.
- Who's that?
- Thunderbolt.
Who else?
- Then he's back?
- He's driving me to the mayor's office.
He goes everywhere with me.
Would you believe something.
He's so unreasonable he doesn't even trust our mayor.
- I know our mayor.
There's nothing unreasonable about that.
Boy, you sure look a lot like your grandma.
I don't think so.
- You ready, Pleasure?
- Ready.
Well, goodbye, everybody.
And thanks ever so, Darrin.
You too, Mrs. Stephens.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
He swings and misses for strik e three, and there are two away here in the sixth inning, the bags loaded with Redlegs.
- I'm ready.
- Ready for what?
My first driving lesson.
Honey, the Sox are loaded in the bottom of the sixth inning.
But I thought you were so anxious He's bringing in the left-hander.
It's going to be the old - Okay, you can talk now.
- Thank you.
I thought you were so anxious to teach me.
I am.
I mean, I was until I found out they were gonna televise the game.
I'd be willing to forget the whole thing.
After all, why should I learn how to drive when I know how to fly?
We've been through all this.
You should learn to drive because the way you fly is for the birds.
Look at it this way: I get where I wanna go faster I save money on gas and oil and I always find a parking space.
You should learn how to drive because a normal wife uses normal transportation.
It's part of the American dream.
All right.
All right, you win.
But teach me now so I can start dinner early.
- As soon as the game is over.
Watching baseball on Sunday afternoon is part of the American dream too.
Okay, fans, we're set for more live action here at Cincinnati's historic Crosley Field.
Now the crafty left-hander gets the sign.
And then I can't believe it.
It's raining.
It's pouring down in the proverbial buck ets.
Oh, look at this.
I can't believe it.
Look at that massive They'll cancel and reschedule.
- Okay, I'll teach you how to drive.
- Yes, sir.
Okay, honey, you sit in the driver's seat.
You comfortable?
Relaxed?
Yes and no.
- Clarification.
- I'm comfortable, but I'm nervous.
I'll relax you with a kiss.
Now, we proceed as follows: Put your left hand on the wheel and with your right hand go like this: What's that for?
That's the classic gesture without which no woman driver can learn to drive.
After you become more advanced, I'll teach you how to blow on your hand to dry your polish and steer with your knees.
Darrin, I'm in no mood for poor jokes.
These newfangled gadgets scare me.
- Newfangled gadgets?
- Well, they're new to me.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Well, we'll start here.
This is the gear selector.
P is for Park.
R, Reverse.
N, Neutral.
D, Drive.
L, Low.
You try it.
P for Park.
R for reverse.
N, Neutral.
D, Drive.
L for Low.
- We'll start with Neutral.
- Did I get them all right?
- Yes.
- I bet you thought I wouldn't because I'm so nervous.
- May I continue?
- Neutral is - Please do, I'm sorry I interrupted.
- Neutral is - It won't happen again.
Neutral is where you place the lever when you wanna start the car.
How come it isn't called S or SC?
I don't know.
Next, you to go to Drive.
Drive is where you put the lever when you wanna go forward.
- In that case, why don't they call it F?
- Because they don't.
Darrin, that's no answer.
If you want me to understand, you have to explain.
Excuse me.
I don't know why they don't call it F. - That's better.
- Low is infrequently used so we'll table that for later discussion.
We'll go directly to Reverse.
Can you guess what Reverse is for?
- For reversing lanes in traffic.
- Wrong.
For going backward.
Backward should be B. These initials are illogical.
Having mastered the gear positions, here's the ignition key.
They call it ignition because it ignites the engine.
The engine ignites?
Isn't that dangerous?
I'm beginning to lose patience.
If you challenge every statement I make this driving lesson could take a year.
Therefore, please keep quiet.
Now, put the key in the ignition.
Put the lever in Neutral.
Turn the key to the right to start the car.
Take off the brake.
Put the lever in Reverse.
Put your right foot on the accelerator and back out of the driveway.
- Just like that?
- Just like that.
Backing out of the driveway is hard.
Why don't you turn the car around and let me front out.
- No.
- Why not?
- I don't feel like it.
I see.
You feel like being mean.
Sam, I'm not being mean, I'm merely Yes, you are.
You're being high-handed and rude and you even told me to shut up.
- I did not, I told you to keep quiet.
- It's the same thing.
- It is not.
It is too.
Your entire attitude is unsympathetic and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt you don't love me and never did.
- Sam - Don't you touch me.
The lesson is over, and I am going into the H for house.
It's incredible.
The playing field here in Cincinnati is in danger of being washed away by a flash flood.
In all the years I've been broadcasting, I've never seen Oh, hold everything!
It stopped raining.
Crosley Field is saved, as if by magic.
I do believe the umpires will be out here in just a moment to tak e a look at this field Hello, sweetheart.
This is your husband, D. - D for dearest or D for darling?
- D for dumb.
I'm sorry I yelled at you in the car yesterday.
You apologised already, remember?
Yeah, I remember.
Anyway, I called a driving school and made a tentative appointment for you at 11:00.
If that's all right with you, I'll confirm it.
You sure you want me to do this?
By all means.
And don't be nervous, sweetheart this time you'll be in the hands of a professional.
- I'm sure everything will be fine.
- All right, darling.
Whatever you say.
Bye.
Reliable Driving School.
Oh, yes, Mr. Stephens, yeah.
You understand it's 10 bucks a lesson, including home pickup and delivery?
Yes, I remember.
I just called to verify Mrs. Stephens' 11:00 appointment.
- Fine.
Eleven this morning will be fine.
Let me have that address, please.
It's 1164 Morning Glory Circle.
Fine.
Well, thank you, Mr. Stephens.
I'll send Mrs. Stephens one of the best instructors in the business.
Thank you.
Harold, you bum, come here.
Yes, Basil?
Due to the condition that my competent instructors are booked solid I'm gonna give you one last chance to redeem yourself.
Oh, I can't tell you how grateful I am.
Sincerely All right, now, don't grovel.
If you weren't my wife's brother I wouldn't give you nothing.
- Oh, I'm not unmindful of that, Basil.
As you know, I got three other married sisters.
But you're the only brother-in-law that I feel any sense of communication with.
Yeah, because their suits don't fit you.
It's a nice fit, thank you.
That's what I mean, you are basically a good human being.
Has Sheila ever talked to you about what it was like when we were kids at home with Mom?
Sheila talks all the time, I don't listen.
It was a world of Little Women.
Four sisters, Mother and Aunt Adelaide.
No wonder Dad reported himself missing in action during the last unpleasantness.
I mean, it was just so much.
Wait a minute.
Hold it, hold it!
I don't know how Sheila talked me into this.
You're too nervous for this kind of work.
But you are the only thing I've got so you are gonna teach a Mrs Savannah Stephens how to operate a motor automobile.
And you are gonna teach her good.
And if you fail, our mutual relative irregardless and notwithstanding you are fired!
And stop eating cookies when I'm giving you an assignment!
- Basil, this isn't a cookie.
- No, what is it?
A tranquilliser.
I need such a big one, the doctor prescribes it in the form of a wafer.
- I'm Reliable.
- That's good.
My name's Samantha Stephens.
Aren't you gonna tell me yours?
- Harold Harold here.
- Hello, hello there.
I'm sorry, but it is rather an unusual name.
By the time Mother named my sisters, she was exhausted.
Well, I see.
Would you like to join me in a cup of coffee?
Do you think we can both fit?
I always like to open with a joke to break the tension.
Good idea.
- Won't you have a seat?
- Yes.
How do you take it?
Black.
One third of a cup.
- Why only one third?
- To protect the carpet.
- Here.
- Thank you.
- I see what you mean.
Cookie?
- Oh, l No, thanks, I brought my own.
Mr. Harold?
How long have you been an instructor?
Three gruelling weeks.
What did you do before that?
Well, last month I was a cashier in a pizza parlour.
And the month before, I was an apprentice plumber.
And the month before that I was a cheap shoe salesman.
Four jobs in four months?
I have four brothers-in-law who take turns hiring and firing me.
It's a vicious circle.
And that's why I tend to be insecure.
- Hello?
- Hi, honey.
I'm calling to find out if your teacher showed up.
- Oh, yes, he's here.
- He is?
What's he like?
Well, I'd say he's a man of considerable experience.
As long as I know you're in good hands, I won't keep you.
Happy driving.
Thank you, darling.
Bye.
That was my husband.
He called to wish me good luck.
We'll need it.
- Well, shall we go?
- I guess.
- Do I get in here?
- Oh, no.
You get in on the driver's side, Mrs. Stephens.
Some students take one look at me and refuse to get in the car.
- Not me.
I like you.
- They worry about accidents.
I've always felt I have what they call a charmed life.
Oh, good.
Thanks.
Ready?
- Ready.
- Oh, dear.
N is for Neutral, where you place lever to start car.
It is.
You'd think they'd call it S or SC.
Turn ignition key to ignite car.
- Ignite car?
- That's right.
D for forward.
You're too far to the left.
Too far to the right!
- Now you're too far in the middle.
- How can I be too far in the middle?
By straddling the white line.
- What white line?
- Well, get over.
Now you're too far right again!
Please don't, Harold, you're making me nervous.
I make you nervous?
Mrs. Stephens, you make me nervous.
- And I was nervous first.
- That's true.
I apologise.
Thank you.
At the next intersection, slow down execute the appropriate hand signal and turn right.
Stop!
I said, stop!
I told you to turn right.
Well, it was one way, the wrong way.
Touché.
However, you should've gone straight ahead because this is a business district with actual traffic.
So back up.
- There's a car behind us.
- Well, signal it to pass.
Oh, all right, plunge onward.
Selfish!
Selfish!
Good morning.
- He ordered you to halt.
- He did?
I thought he was saying hello.
- That's all Basil has to see, a ticket.
- Who's Basil?
Mrs. Stephens, don't talk, drive.
How am I doing?
How to phrase it tactfully?
You are rotten.
Be careful, there's a moving van up ahead!
- What happened?
- Everything's fine.
- We're going the other way.
- Well, I'll make a U-turn.
No.
Don't.
Not here.
There's no room.
- You did it.
- This is a lot harder than flying.
You fly?
And you don't know how to drive?
- Well - Stop.
I can't stand another minute.
All right.
All right, I'll park.
- Where?
- Here.
- Why, there's barely room for a bicycle.
- We're fine, Mr. Harold.
- There's nothing to be nervous about.
- Who's nervous?
P for Park.
- How did you do that?
- She's a witch.
- Who said that?
- Who said what?
- I heard a voice from the back seat.
- Maybe it's another witch.
- The back seat is empty.
- It is?
Look again.
I hear a voice, but I don't see a body.
Mother, will you please stop playing games.
Will you please behave yourself.
- Are you talking to me?
- No to me.
Mother, you're embarrassing me and confusing Mr. Harold.
You're a ventriloquist, right?
- Not exactly.
- Oh, Samantha, you can fly.
Why on earth do you bother with this ridiculous contraption?
Mr. Harold, please don't go, just ignore her.
Ignore whom?
- Well - Say no more, Mrs. Stephens.
I knew it was coming.
I finally cracked.
I'll turn myself in.
- What should we do with the car?
- Burn it.
Sheila.
Aunt Adelaide.
Mom!
- Mother, you put that back.
- Must I?
It's Mr. Harold's car.
He is high-strung, isn't he?
You should be ashamed.
You got that poor dear man talking to himself.
I know.
And I'm sure it's a fascinating conversation.
- Darrin, it was all my fault.
- Sweetheart, you were doing your best.
But Mother was in one of her prankish moods.
- You mean your mother was there too?
- Well, she was and she wasn't.
After I drove into the moving van and parked the car and made the U-turn Mother got a case of the cutes.
- What's that mean, exactly?
You know.
She kept popping in and out.
- Oh, boy, that poor guy.
- That's what I mean.
I'd hate to think he'd lost his job because of me.
- So do you mind coming with me?
- Where?
- To Reliable.
I'll drive.
- No thanks.
I'll drive.
Yeah, tell him that I've been paying the same rent for nine years and that's as high as I'm gonna go.
Greetings, folks.
Excuse the cramped quarters, but it's only temporary.
We're Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
We brought back your car.
- Oh, thanks.
- You're welcome.
Is instructor Harold here?
Former instructor Harold is in the back, cleaning out his desk.
Excuse me.
Reliable Driving School.
Yes, Miss Anderson, could I have that address?
Certainly.
We've been serving the community for years.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Have a wafer, Mr. Harold.
- This is my husband, Mr. Stephens.
- Hi.
Hi.
- There's something I have to tell you.
- Peachy.
Don't ask me to go into detail, it's kind of complicated but that voice you heard in the car was Mrs. Stephen's mother.
She's Well, sometimes I can't see her myself.
- And he's her son-in-law.
- Big deal.
It is.
It proves that although there's plenty wrong with her there's nothing wrong with you.
- Why not let bygones be bygones and continue my driving lessons.
- Sorry.
I'm hanging up my helmet.
I'm gonna seek my livelihood in a field that offers a little more human dignity.
- Like what?
- I don't know.
Maybe begging for pennies on skid row.
Why, Mr. Harold, you can't quit just because one of minor disaster.
- I can't?
- You can't keep going from job to job or you'll tend to be insecure forever.
You have to stick to your wheel and see it through.
Right?
- Right.
- Wrong.
Thanks, kids, for your interest, but you don't understand.
I'm not quitting.
I was fired, for a change.
Mrs. Stevenson, as a special concession I'm going to teach you to drive myself.
No, thank you.
I'd rather be taught by Mr. Harold.
Mr. Harold is no longer in the firm.
He deserted while on duty and abandoned his vehicle at the mercy of a rank beginner.
She didn't move that car one inch after Mr. Harold left.
She called me at my office, I came right over and That ain't the point!
Mr. Harold wasn't only fired for that.
As a driving instructor in general, he stinks.
That's not true, he's excellent.
And if you don't hire him back, I'II I'll take my husband's money someplace else.
Okay, okay.
You found my Achilles heel.
You're back in the organisation on a trial probation.
On behalf of myself and my sisters What I mean is, there are times when mere words aren't enough.
Thank you.
Don't worry if I'm not here when you get home.
- I have a lesson this afternoon.
- A lesson?
Yes, my basket-weaving.
Basket-weaving?
You didn't tell me anything about that.
I found the most wonderful class where they teach you to how to weave things.
Baskets, carpets, all sort of things.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Stephens.
- Hi.
Just popped by.
My student's waiting at the curb champing at the bit, you might say.
What time's class?
- Five-thirty.
Will you be there?
- I wouldn't miss it.
Bye, all.
- Well, well.
- What was that all about?
I told Harold about my basket-weaving class.
It's done wonders for him.
He's given up wafers, he stands up to his brother-in-law.
There's even talk of making him a partner.
- What time did you say that class was?
- Five-thirty, why?
I'll see you there.
Good.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Well, Mary and I have been discussing it and we've decided we won't be able to go to Miami to the conclave.
We just don't feel right about going off and leaving your poor Aunt Clara by herself.
- Doesn't she want to go along?
- Of course she does.
But she won't.
She's no longer able to fly that far.
Oh, poor dear.
And she's too proud to take a plane.
Well, you know, she gets all mixed up in her spells and when anyone tries to help her, she gets so depressed.
- Where is she now?
- She should be here.
I offered to bring her, but she insisted on flying by herself.
What can I do to help?
Let her stay with you until we get back from Florida.
You seem to be doing so well without witchcraft.
Maybe you could show Clara how to manage.
Well, of course she can stay with us.
And we'll help her in any way we can.
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
Oh, that must be Clara now.
Don't you worry.
I'll talk to her.
It would be better if I weren't here.
She gets terribly self-conscious in front of me.
Well, you run along, and don't worry.
All right.
Goodbye, dear.
I'll just go out this way.
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara?
- Aunt Clara.
- Oh, thank goodness it's you.
Oh, dear.
I've lost my doorknobs.
No, you haven't.
They're all over the floor.
Just don't move.
- How did you get in the closet?
- Oh, I don't know.
- I don't know.
- Don't go away.
Oh, dear.
Well, at least I'm in the right house.
Of course I'm glad Aunt Clara is here for a visit but I wish you'd let me know.
Sorry I couldn't get you to cancel the theatre tickets but I knew you'd understand.
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.
Aunt Clara, I'm so glad to see you.
Oh, thank you, dear.
No, now, I don't need any looking after, and I refuse to be treated as a guest.
I hope you'll excuse me if I give you a hug once in a while.
Well, all right.
But don't overdo it.
- Here you are, Aunt Clara.
- No, no, I don't need that.
- Would you like a little sherry?
- Oh, yes, but I'll get my own sherry.
I can still do things for myself, although some people think otherwise.
Now, let me see.
Now, there's: Prendel broom stackpool Oh, I'm so sorry.
Don't worry.
Don't worry, Aunt Clara.
No harm done.
None at all.
These are my favourites.
Here you are, dear.
Oh, but you handed it to me.
Yes, of course.
- Oh, so you've forgotten the spell too?
- No, no.
We prefer it this way.
No witchcraft.
Oh, well, I see what you're trying to tell me and you're both very sweet but I'm not going to stay here another moment unless you go on living your lives just as if I weren't here.
All right, if that's the way you feel.
Darrin and I have tickets for the theatre tonight, and we're gonna use them.
And since you're not a guest, you can come and help me fix dinner.
Oh, good.
I'll take my sherry with me.
Better hurry, honey.
We'll be late.
Now, have a good time.
A good, good time.
- Don't you work too hard.
- No.
- You promise.
- I promise.
- All right.
- Bye-bye.
Have a good time.
Well, now, I suppose we must get all you dirty dishes into the kitchen.
Now, gently, now, so none of us break.
Frank en, loo, crumple Oh, dear.
I wonder what I did wrong.
Well, now, I suppose I can do the leftovers myself.
Suds.
Suds Zolthan, durbin, lye, loam Oh, well, that wasn't so difficult, was it?
Zolthan, durbin, lime Infinito.
Oh, no.
Stop them Stop them, halt them, stop them Help.
Oh, help them It was a great play, if you ask me.
Don't you think so?
Well, sweetheart, I've seen an awful lot of plays.
- Oh, really?
- I was only kidding.
I agree with you 100 percent.
Well, I hope Aunt Clara found something to amuse herself.
My stars.
Aunt Clara?
I had a bit of trouble in the kitchen.
Oh, my goodness.
Here, Aunt Clara.
A nice cup of tea will make you feel better.
Oh, now, you know, I feel terrible of the mess I made of things.
Don't be silly.
Matter of fact, you've done me a favour.
The house never looked cleaner.
I can't do the simplest thing, like washing the dishes or the simplest kind of a spell.
You could learn the mortal way of doing things.
Oh, no, I don't wanna do that.
Aunt Clara, you are simply feeling sorry for yourself.
And who has a better right?
No, no, I might as well face it.
I'm earthbound.
I'm nothing but a helpless old witch.
- I hope we're doing the right thing.
- Of course we are, darling.
All ready, Aunt Clara.
It'll be good for her to get out with us, and she'll love the Caldwells.
I know.
I just don't want her to feel we're pushing too hard.
Nonsense.
She'll have a marvellous time.
Well, here I am, here I am.
- All set, Aunt Clara?
- Oh, yes, yes, dear, yes.
- But I do feel like a fifth wheel.
- What's wrong with a fifth wheel?
There have been many times I was glad I had a spare.
What's he mean by that?
- Hi.
Hi, Darrin.
- Hi, Bea.
This is my Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara, Bea Caldwell.
- I'm glad to meet you.
- How do you do?
Stash your coats, we may be here for a while.
- Tom still working?
- We'll meet him downtown.
- I'm afraid we have other problems.
- What happened?
My regular babysitter copped out on us.
I haven't been able to find another one.
- Something wrong, Aunt Clara?
- No, no.
I was just admiring the doorknob.
- Let me take your coat.
- No, you run along with the others.
I'll hang it up myself.
I beg your pardon.
You must have somebody on call in case of an emergency.
I collect goldfish.
Would you like to see them?
Oh, I certainly would, yes.
I'm going to introduce her to my fish.
Well, thank you.
Well, that's that.
No babysitter.
- It's a shame, Bea.
- Well, I wanted to be a mother.
- Fish are a lot of fun.
- Oh, yes, I'm sure they are.
Why don't you three go downtown and meet Tom.
- Nothing doing.
- No, please.
It's better than leaving him in the big city by himself.
Let him come home.
We'll fix something.
Oh, well, you know, I have a splendid idea.
Now, why don't you all run along, and I'll stay here with Jimmy.
Oh, no, no.
I wouldn't think of it.
No, Aunt Clara.
Wherever we go, you go.
Oh, no, but I'd enjoy it.
Really, I would.
It's sweet of you to offer, Aunt Clara, but we can go out to dinner another time.
Oh, well, if I'm a guest, I must do as you like but if I had my druthers, I'd rather stay here with Jimmy.
Well, all right.
If you'd rather.
I wanna show you my marbles.
- I got an agate lagger.
- Oh, no.
Have a good time.
I'll get our coats.
What do you think?
I think it's marvellous.
Oh, isn't he nice and fluffy.
Yes, but he doesn't like me much.
Oh, that's nonsense.
Of course he does.
Well, now, you watch.
Hey, he wagged his tail.
Yes, now, wasn't that good?
This is my favourite, but I broke it.
Oh, that's a pity.
Well, let me see, now.
Oh, maybe I can fix it.
Sailboat mast Boy, how did you do that?
Oh, it's really nothing.
What else can you do?
Well, I can't do what I used to do, but let me see.
How would you like a toy soldier?
Well Oh, dear.
Done it again.
Well - Hey, you're a magician.
- No, no, I'm a witch.
You are?
Gee, I wish you could live here all the time.
Oh, thank you very much, Jimmy.
Well, now, off to bed.
Hey!
Neato.
I'm sorry, Aunt Clara is booked solid on Thursday.
Just a minute.
She could sit with your little girl from 2 until 4:30 on Friday.
No, Saturday is all filled up.
Okay, 2:00 Friday.
Fine.
Oh, fine.
Yes, I'll have her there at 2:00 a week from Thursday.
Bye.
Isn't it wonderful?
I've never been so busy in all my life.
Neither have I. Come on, let's go.
Now, no more arguments.
You go to sleep.
Hey, it squirted in my face.
See what happens when you're naughty?
Well, we had breakfast in Cairo, then we flew off to London.
How did you fly, Aunt Clara, prop or jet?
- Proper what?
- Jet.
What airlines did you take from Cairo to London?
Airlines?
Witches don't bother with airlines.
They just take off.
Really?
Gee, how do you do it?
Well, when you're a young witch, it's easy.
All the joy of wanting to be in some place and "ala-kazaam," you're on your way.
- Ala-kazaam!
- Ala-kazaam!
But it's different when you get older.
You mean you can't fly anymore?
Well, not like I used to.
I can't even fly across the Gulf of Mexico with a favourable wind.
But you still can make short hops, can't you?
Oh, well, if I'm up to it.
From rooftop to rooftop, that sort of thing.
Are you up to it tonight, Aunt Clara?
Will you show us how?
Oh, no, Louise.
No, no, not tonight.
But by the way I'm feeling I may be up to it by next week.
Oh, boy, that's great.
And in the meantime Do you think it's normal for a babysitter to tell children she's a witch?
Oh, Agnes, it's just a way to amuse them.
I don't know what she's done to my kids, but they believe she's a witch.
So do Louise and Gary.
And if you ask me, I think she believes it herself.
But Aunt Clara's a good witch.
If I promise not to try, then will you let her fly off our roof?
- Elsie?
- But, Mama Please be quiet.
Oh, no, not you, Elsie.
There's something I think you should know about Aunt Clara before you hear it from your children.
You have?
Yes.
This paper says that Aunt Clara is restrained from further babysitting until she reports to Judge Virgil Winner for a hearing.
- There's a troublemaker around here.
- Now, Sam, calm down.
- Never trouble trouble.
- I will not calm down.
Just when she found something she loves?
It isn't fair.
That I agree with, but if Clara appears before that judge and starts talking I wanna come face to face with the person that started this smear campaign against my Aunt Clara.
And I'll help you.
But no rash acts, no temper, and above all, no: Please, promise, for everyone's sake.
- Well - Sam.
All right, Darrin, I promise.
Aunt Clara.
Is there no surname?
It isn't necessary.
You may call me Aunt Clara.
Very well.
Aunt Clara are you aware of the nature of the complaints Mrs. Agnes Bain has filed against you?
Yes, of course.
Quite aware.
Now, you understand, this is not a trial.
It's only a hearing to determine the accuracy of the complaints.
Would you mind answering a few questions?
Oh, not at all, not at all.
Aunt Clara, do you know the meaning of the word competence?
Yes, I do.
Do you believe that you are a competent person?
Well, of course.
But there's some things I don't do as well as I used to.
Not at my age.
Who does?
- Aunt Clara, do you like children?
- Why, very much so.
Do you ever feel resentful toward children?
Resentful?
Oh, my, no.
Why should I?
Sometimes when we get a little older, we resent those who are younger.
Well, I suppose you have a point there.
But I don't think resentful is the right word.
No, I think we like to look back, remember when we were young.
At a time free of care, you know.
Full of happiness and music and bright colours.
Aunt Clara, during your employment as a babysitter did you ever tell children you are a witch?
Oh, yes.
You told them this in a spirit of make-believe?
Oh, no, no, I was quite serious.
Witches are evil beings.
Were you trying to frighten the children?
Oh, certainly not.
And what makes you think that witches are evil?
Well, aren't they?
- Oh, pure "flumery".
- I beg your pardon?
Oh, "flapdoodle" and "blatherscythe".
We're like just ordinary people.
Only, we do little extra things, that's all.
What sort of little extra things?
Some of us paint, write music like Mozart and Rembrandt.
You mean Mozart and Rembrandt were witches?
Well, you don't think they were ordinary human beings, do you?
Aunt Clara, what sort of extra things are you able to do?
Well, not as many as I could when I was younger.
Well, let's put it this way.
Did you tell the children in your care that you could perform feats of magic?
Oh, yes.
I did tricks for them.
What kind of tricks?
Can you do any of them now?
I suppose I can.
How about a rabbit?
Rabbit.
Let me see That would be: Winking, blinking, three times three Doesn't look like a rabbit, does it?
Well, now, let me see Well, I thought a rabbit was: Winking and blinking Well, it is, yes.
Four times four Yes, it isn't right yet.
Well, we're getting closer.
Oh, dear.
You know, I knew the spell just as well as I know my own name.
Now: Winking, blinking and Oh, yes.
Ten times 10 How did you do that?
I didn't I'm not sure.
Very funny.
If you think this is a laughing matter ask her how she intended to fly off the roof carrying my children.
Will you be seated, Mrs. Bain?
Now, Aunt Clara, had you intended to attempt such a thing?
Well, I told the children that if it were possible, I'd fly with them next week.
They got a great kick out of that.
But it wasn't possible so I explained to them that I was no longer a young witch and there would be no flying from rooftop to rooftop.
We don't like to disappoint children, do we?
I could make it up to them with several other little tricks I think they'd like.
I just have one more question I'd like you to answer.
Could you possibly arrange to come sit at my house with my son?
He's 7 years old.
Oh, yes.
I'd be delighted.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry, judge, but Aunt Clara won't be available for the next two weeks.
She's going to Florida today.
She'll be glad to sit with little Otis when she gets back.
Oh, thank you.
Bye.
You've got a list of clients whenever you want.
Well, isn't that nice.
You all set?
We have to hurry to get the train.
No, no, you don't have to drive me.
I can get there under my own power.
Aunt Clara, are you sure?
Well, I told you I felt much better.
Oh, I'll prove it.
- Are you all right?
- Fine, fine.
- What went wrong?
- Maybe you didn't concentrate.
Could be.
You know, these walls are getting harder and harder.
Well, I proved it.
Oh, there's no witch like an old witch.
I'll get the car.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Automatic doors by Magi-Door Company - Thank you.
the automatic door manufactured that can be opened as far as a mile away.
And as you approach your garage, you merely press the button in your car like so and presto, the garage door is open.
Presto, the garage door is closed.
- How do you like that for magic?
- Not bad.
I have some brochures here that explain everything.
Would you like to take one home?
Abner, Samantha Stephens.
I'll see you at the car, Abner.
- You all right?
- I think so.
Didn't you read?
This door is out of order.
Not for Samantha Stephens, it isn't.
How is that, Abner?
- Tell me.
Please explain it to me.
- I'll explain it you.
You're out of order.
Abner, did you see that?
Now, that's what I call magic.
She opened the garage door.
So, what do you want me to do, applaud?
No, no, she opened it, no hands, nothing.
- She just sat there.
- Why don't you stop.
They probably got an electric door like they demonstrated down at the market.
I don't believe it.
She opens doors without electricity.
Somebody ought to tell the electric company.
They're losing a bundle.
I'm losing a bundle on you.
I have to pay for a glass door.
Eye glasses, lessons on how to read would be cheaper.
All right, go ahead and joke.
I'm telling you, she's strange.
- She's strange?
You're strange.
- So prove it.
- Prove you're strange?
- Prove they've got an electric door.
- How?
- Go over and ask them.
I will.
Tonight I'll go.
Why do you have to wait until tonight?
Because if I have to look like an idiot, I'd rather do it in the dark.
I don't know, Sam, this is expensive.
I can make do with my old rod and reel.
You cannot make do with your old rod and reel.
This is your vacation.
You've earned it and deserve the best.
- I have spoken.
- Like a true and loving wife.
Which, by an odd coincidence, I just happen to be.
Best odd coincidence I ever heard of.
Somebody's timing leaves much to be desired.
Much.
- Well, hi, Mr. Kravitz.
- Hello, Mr. Stephens.
- Come in.
- No.
No, thank you.
I just stopped by for a second.
I wanted to ask you about your door.
- Our door?
- Pretty nice.
I've been thinking of getting one too.
You recommend it?
- Why, no house should be without one.
- Wait a minute.
I'm not talking about this door.
I was talking about your garage door.
- Our garage door?
- I'm thinking of getting one.
And today when my wife and I saw yours work - Ours work?
- Your electric door.
Samantha.
Was our electric garage door working today, sweetheart?
- Only once.
- Only once.
That's what I'm afraid of.
Some of these new gimmicks, they haven't got the kinks out yet.
Did you get yours from the guy at the market?
I forget.
Which market did we get ours from, sweetheart?
- Do you mind if I have a look at it?
- Look at it?
Well, there's no point in looking at it tonight it's so dark out, especially with it not working.
Why don't you come back tomorrow night.
We'll give you a full demonstration.
Yes.
Thank you.
Darling what are you going to do?
- Do?
It's simple.
I'll have to buy one new electric garage door and make do with one old rod and reel.
You ready, Max?
Okay, now.
Three, two, one, zero.
A-okay, Noel.
Be my guest.
Well, that wraps it up, lady.
- Wear it in good health.
- Just what I've always wanted.
Only not really.
You know you can be as far as a block away and open that door?
Is that so?
That's hard to believe.
Well, your husband should be very pleased with it.
I don't think so.
He didn't wanna buy it for himself.
- He didn't?
- No.
That's why you had it put in, huh?
- We had it put in for the neighbours.
- That makes sense.
Not to me, it doesn't.
Bye.
Ain't it a shame?
Always the good-Iooking ones.
Here, they come up empty.
I was just thinking of that installation on Maple.
I put in one of these doors and tuned in the receiver just a little bit wrong.
- What happened?
- I got tuned in on the aircraft bands.
- An aircraft band?
- Every time a plane went overhead and the pilot turned on the radio, it opened the Brians' garage door.
It was a real fluke.
I probably couldn't do it again if I tried.
I closed that.
At least I thought I did.
I know I did.
All right, have it your own way.
Stay open.
- Hello, dear.
- Oh, hi, Moth - I should have known.
- What are you talking about?
You're the one that's been opening and closing my garage door.
I've been doing nothing of the kind.
Oh, really, Samantha, if I was starved for entertainment I certainly could conjure up something more amusing than that.
Then who has been doing it?
I haven't the faintest idea.
Now, what's all this nonsense about garage doors, anyway?
Well, it's a long, dull story, Mother.
I made the mistake of flipping ours open, and Gladys Kravitz saw me.
- Is that the story?
- Just about.
Well, it's not long, but it certainly is dull.
Darrin was afraid that Mrs. Kravitz's curiosity might lead to trouble.
He gave up his fishing equipment and bought this gadget for the door.
That is sad.
That's the longest, dullest, saddest story I've ever heard.
But if that's all that's troubling you I'll fix it.
Oh, my stars.
All right, Mother, your little joke is over, now take all this stuff away.
I thought you said Dobbin needed new fishing equipment.
- Dobbin is a horse.
- Yes.
Darrin is my husband, and he wants fishing equipment he pays for himself.
Abner!
All right.
All right, Samantha.
No lectures, please.
Good.
Look for yourself.
I never saw anything like it.
Stop pushing.
I know that when I turn my head to look there will be nothing there.
Stop talking.
Get up on that thing and look.
- Like I said, there's nothing there.
- What?
But I saw it.
It was a room full of poles and reels and fish.
With a sailfish this big, and rubber boots.
Hey!
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, darling.
- You're late.
- I know.
I missed the bus.
That's another thing we can blame on that door.
- Another thing?
- Yes.
If you hadn't had to leave the car to have that thing installed Oh, well.
Hurry up.
I tried to call you, but you were in a meeting.
- Why, what's the matter?
- That door.
I wondered why you left it open.
You mean it's open again?
That's the fifth time today.
That's what I mean.
- What's what you mean?
- Well, it keeps opening and closing opening and closing all by itself.
At first, I thought Mother was responsible but she swears she isn't.
Then I thought it might be the kids in the neighbourhood fooling around so I watched, but no kids.
No kids, huh?
No.
They were all in school.
Really, Darrin, it's strange.
There was nobody around nobody around for miles.
And the door kept opening and closing all by itself, huh?
Exactly.
It's eerie.
It gives me the creeps.
- What do you suggest we do about it?
- Well, that's the best part.
The solution to all our problems.
Well, there's obviously something the matter with that darn door defective or something, so - So?
So we call the company after we've shown it to the Kravitzs to prove we really had one.
We show them that it doesn't work, which we established last night.
We make the company take back the door they return the money, and you get your rod and reel as planned.
- Marvellous?
- Marvellous.
That was a nice touch about your mother.
And I like the bit about the kids too.
It gave it a note of reality.
Darrin, don't you believe me?
Even if it were true, the company wouldn't give us our money back.
They'd just fix the door, that's all.
What do you mean "if it were true"?
Come on, honey, we've gotta get going.
Darrin.
Sweetheart, will you come on?
Darrin.
Darrin.
Darling, I appreciate why you wanna do this.
I know you feel guilty about our having to buy that door.
It's generous of you to wanna make it up to me.
But you can't do it with this.
That would be cheating.
If you put a on that door and threw the mechanism out of whack the company will have to pay for it.
You don't believe me.
I want you to put your nose out to pasture.
- Now you're being ridiculous.
- I am not being ridiculous.
As a matter of fact, I'm not suggesting, requesting, not even putting in a plea.
I am commanding.
Calmly, but commanding.
No more witchcraft.
No matter how tempted or provoked you may be.
- You mean like now.
- That's right.
Even like now.
- Sam.
- Darrin.
If you don't listen to me, we're going to have a fight.
If you don't do as I ask, we're going to have a war.
All right.
All right.
Believe me nothing in this world could ever make me resort to witchcraft again.
Not after this.
- Shall we go?
- Thank you.
Abner, they just came out of the house.
They're getting into the car.
- Who?
- The Stephens.
You interrupted Johann Sebastian Bach to deliver that startling bulletin?
- I think they're going out together.
- Well, that's nice.
They're married.
- Where is it?
- What?
The button.
Thank you.
What's the matter?
It's Nothing the matter.
It's out of kilter or something.
- I'll let it rest for a minute.
- Oh, by all means.
We wouldn't want to tire it out.
Now.
- It's dead.
- In this marvellous door?
If you hadn't played around with it this afternoon It either operates electronically or manually.
I suggest that if we're going to get to the Tates' this evening you open it manually.
- That's what I'm doing.
- They'll hear you.
- Well, I've got nothing to hide.
I do.
I don't want them peeking over here while I'm spying on them, so don't play.
Well, let me know when they go.
They're just sitting in the car in the garage.
Good.
Should I go back to Bach, or would you rather hear "Cheek to Cheek"?
What would you like, Gladys?
Make a request.
Don't play.
Wait a minute.
- Where's the switch?
- What switch?
To put it on manual.
Can't operate it manually unless you turn off - They never talked about a switch.
- You didn't ask?
- It's gotta be around here somewhere.
- Outside, maybe.
They don't put them outside, they put them inside in case somebody gets trapped in the garage.
How could anyone get trapped in a garage?
Well, they could have a short, like we have and they might not be able to find the switch, like we can't and they might get trapped in the garage, like we are.
Sam, we gotta get out of here.
- How?
- I don't know how.
Sure I do.
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead what?
You know.
- Open the door.
- You're kidding.
- Do I look like I'm kidding?
- You made me swear.
My solemn oath.
My vow.
But this is an emergency.
You said "under no conditions," and I quote.
I'm glad you remember, sweetheart, but Under no circumstances.
Well, that's right.
And that's what I meant.
But under no ordinary circumstances and these are certainly not ordinary circumstances.
- So I uncommand you.
- You can't do that.
It can't be "no" one minute and "yes" the next.
If I give my word, and I gave my word it's a matter of principle.
It is indeed a matter of principle.
And I, your husband, am asking you, my wife, to open that door.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Darrin.
I didn't touch that door, honestly.
Of course you didn't, but thank you anyway.
You don't believe me.
Well, that does it.
- Sam, what you are doing?
- That is one crazy, nutty, rotten door.
If you're gonna believe it and not me, there's no point in going on.
So take your pick, it or me.
For crying out loud, do you know what you're saying?
I know that I'm perfectly willing to take the blame for anything I do.
But I am not going to take the blame for whoever or whatever is turning that door into an electronic yo-yo.
So there.
- Gladys, get away from the window.
- Could you explain something to me?
If it's about why we got married, no.
Why would two grown-up people get all dressed up walk out their front door into the garage and just sit there?
Why, Abner?
Explain it to me.
What are they doing?
Maybe they're necking.
I want you to come over there with me right now.
- Gladys, please.
- No, I mean it.
There's something fishy going on, and I wanna find out what it is.
Sam.
Don't be angry.
What's there to be angry about?
You don't believe me.
That's plenty to get angry about.
I believe you.
If you're gonna get this angry, I believe you.
- You promise?
- I promise.
I know they're in there.
I saw them with my own eyes.
- Didn't you see them, Abner?
- Yes, Gladys.
What are they doing in there?
Inhaling carbon monoxide, maybe.
How do I know?
You may be right.
Open the door, Abner.
It's not my place to open their door, Gladys.
There.
You see?
I couldn't have opened it.
You were kissing me.
You were in front of my nose.
You saw my nose.
Now, take it easy, sweetheart.
I believe you.
I believe you.
- Did you hear that, Abner?
- What?
- Something about her nose.
- Keep your voice down.
Good evening.
We saw you going into the garage, and we thought maybe you were in trouble.
We couldn't get the door open.
I was asking my wife to open it.
You asked her to open the garage door?
Well, it wouldn't open.
That seemed like the only solution.
That isn't what I mean at all.
What I mean is Sometimes you hear about women doing things with hairpins.
- You understand what I mean?
- Well, I do.
You see, he means that sometimes women can work magic with things that don't work.
And when that happens, a man should definitely let her do so.
- Right, darling?
- Right, darling.
Well, we've got to get going.
Good night.
- Good night.
- Night.
Notice I didn't say one word about her being strange.
I'm glad you didn't.
She isn't.
He is.
Well, it's all fixed.
You won't have that problem again.
- What about the Kravitzs' door?
- Oh, theirs is working fine.
But while we're here, we'll check it again just to make sure.
Why don't you turn off the Kravitzs' door until we check it for shorts.
- I already did.
- That's what I was doing.
It's off now.
- Swell.
Well, Mr. Stephens, would you like to give it a try?
Okay.
There, now, see?
- How about that?
- That's real nice.
We got ours too.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Try switching them around.
A little further to the left now.
Sam, I've gotta go to work.
Of all the time to hang pictures.
Only take a minute.
We've been putting it off.
We have to get it done sometime.
Move the left one.
Up, up.
- Up, Darrin.
Up, up, Darrin.
- Do I get a biscuit?
That looks terrible.
Nothing works.
I do and I have to be there at 9:00.
- But when are we gonna do this?
- When I get home.
That's what you always say.
I'm tired of looking at a blank wall.
- Don't worry.
You'll think of something.
- Sure.
- There's always one thing we can do.
- What?
Move.
I'll see you tonight.
- Good morning, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Good morning.
Is Mrs. Stephens home?
I'd like to return this.
She's inside arranging some pictures.
Maybe you can help.
Oh, I'd be glad to.
I'm very good at that.
I'm glad somebody is.
See you later.
You moved the pictures.
Now, Mrs. Kravitz.
This time I saw you do it.
I saw it.
I caught you red-handed.
- I was just hanging pictures.
- From 10 feet away?
All along I've said there were crazy things going on in this house.
People appearing and disappearing and furniture moving around.
It must be your imagination.
I have no imagination.
I'm telling you, Mrs. Kravitz, there's nothing going on.
I say that there is and so does Mrs. Grunbacher.
- Mrs. Grunbacher?
- Yes.
I told her all about you, and she believes me.
- She's got a theory.
- She does?
Yes, and now I happen to believe her.
- You do?
- We don't think you're one of us.
- You don't?
- You're from Venus, aren't you?
- Venus?
- Don't touch me.
Mrs. Kravitz, this has gone far enough.
There is absolutely no truth in what you're saying.
Mrs. Grunbacher's the biggest gossip in the neighbourhood.
How can you believe such nonsense?
Venus.
All right, all right.
Maybe you're not from Venus.
But I saw what you did with my own eyes.
And whatever or whoever you are, we'll find out.
- What do you mean?
- She has a friend at the university.
He knows about these supernatural things.
- We'll see what he thinks.
- Mrs. Kravitz.
Wait.
I've got something to tell you.
It is Venus, isn't it?
Remember, we want peace.
We're a peace-Ioving world.
- Now, we've had problems - Will you please listen to me?
What you just saw, well Maybe those pictures did move by themselves.
She's unlocking the secrets of the universe.
You probably won't believe this Of all the ears in the world mine have been chosen to hear the secrets of life.
Talk, talk, talk.
If those pictures did move did it ever occur to you that you might have moved them?
- Me?
- Every time these strange things supposedly happen, and you insist they do, you've been watching, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Maybe you were doing more than just watching.
What are you talking about?
Maybe you were doing those things.
Now, I'm not sure but it might have something to do with extrasensory perception.
They've been doing a lot of studying about ESP.
People moving objects, predicting the future.
Mrs. Kravitz, I think you've got it.
When I was hanging those pictures, you were thinking about them, right?
Yes.
Mind over matter.
Thought waves can work wonders.
Especially from an intelligent, fertile mind like yours.
You You mean I moved the pictures?
Oh, I couldn't have done it.
I couldn't have.
Well, there's one way to prove if you've got the power.
How, how, how?
I saw it on a television show once.
Now, you close your eyes and concentrate and I'm going to write a number on this piece of paper.
And then you tell me what it is.
Thirty-seven?
I did it!
I did it!
I can't believe it.
All the time it was me.
Oh, I just can't believe it.
What am I gonna do?
Wait until Mrs. Grunbacher hears about this.
Oh, I wouldn't discuss this with Mrs. Grunbacher or anyone else, at least for a while.
- What's the matter?
- Abner, he needs me.
Abner, Abner, I'm coming.
Mrs. Kravitz.
Mrs Abner, Abner, I'm here, I felt it.
You want me, you want me.
- Why would I want you?
- You're all right?
- There's nothing wrong?
- I'm fine.
Thank goodness.
- You been eating those radishes again?
- A wonderful thing has happened.
Guess what I've got.
Heartburn.
Abner, I've got the power.
Take lemon juice and hot water.
That'll knock it out.
- It's nothing to joke about.
- All right.
Until you get over it, I'll sleep in the den.
Do the initials ESP mean anything to you?
ESP?
ESP?
Oh, now I get all this funny business.
Esther Perlman's coming, right?
- Extrasensory perception.
I've got it.
- What?
Mind over matter.
Predicting the future or talking to the spirits.
Who knows what I can do?
Where did you get this crazy idea?
I was over at the Stephens' house.
Now, I know it's hard to believe, Abner, but I moved the pictures on their wall without even touching them.
You moved their pictures?
Over here I'd be glad if you just dusted the pictures.
You don't believe me, do you?
When is this all gonna stop?
When?
When am I gonna have peace?
The last time it was yoga.
Before that it was karate.
Remember this: To protect yourself at night from strangers.
To tell the truth, I wish you'd go out some night and meet a stranger.
All right, Mr. Smarty-Pants, we'll see who's got ESP.
Now, you write down a number on a piece of paper and I'll tell you what it is.
Write down a number?
Gladys, I got better things to do than to play games.
What?
You're retired.
Go ahead, any number.
- Gladys.
- Write it.
Got one life, and I have to live it with her.
Don't let me see it.
I see numbers, numbers.
The number is seven.
Wrong, it's one.
Go make lunch.
- It's seven.
See that little thing there?
- That's a one.
That is a one.
You made a seven, and you don't even know it.
You're nuts, and you don't even know it.
I made a one.
That's how I make a one.
- It's seven.
- One.
- Seven.
- One.
Seven.
Why won't you admit you were thinking a seven?
All right.
It's a seven.
You see, I've got the power.
I can do anything.
- You can do anything?
- Yes.
Good.
Disappear.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Hi, Mrs Mrs. Kravitz?
Is something the matter, Mrs. Kravitz?
Water.
Don't go near her, she's crazy.
She's trying to turn on the sprinklers.
Give me the key.
You don't need the key.
You're forgetting my powers.
I can will the sprinklers on.
Sprinklers on.
What's happening?
The lawn is dying, that's what's happening.
Three hundred dollars worth of landscaping.
Give me the key.
Mr. Kravitz.
Water.
- Water.
- Does she get like this often?
I've never seen her this bad.
She thinks she's got special powers.
Turning on the sprinklers, guessing numbers, moving pictures.
Where'd she get an idea like that?
- From your wife, I think.
- Water.
Mrs. Kravitz?
Mrs. Kravitz, what did my wife tell you?
Everything.
If it wasn't for her I wouldn't know the secrets of the universe.
She gave me the power.
I don't believe it.
Water, water.
You see?
I did it.
I got the power, I did it.
You did what?
That's from the sky, dum-dum, not the sprinklers.
Close enough.
I've got the power!
Samantha!
- What's the matter?
- "What's the matter"?
You see what's going on out there?
She's raving like a maniac.
What did you do to her?
- Well - Come on, Sam, do something.
You gotta stop her.
Don't worry, darling, it's not that serious.
Not that serious.
Look at her.
She thinks she's the rainmaker.
- Did you talk to her?
- Yes.
- She thinks she still has the power.
- What's she doing out there?
- She's trying to turn off the rain.
- Trying to turn off the rain?
Abner insulted her.
He wouldn't believe she turned it on so now she's gonna show him and turn it off.
Rain, go away.
Look at that woman.
She's standing there stiff as a board.
She looks like a lawn statue.
She promised me she was coming right in.
Oh, she's gonna get pneumonia.
- Maybe I'd better turn it off.
- Are you kidding?
Gladys will think she did it, tomorrow she'll try for an eclipse.
You really did it this time, Sam.
Now, it isn't all my fault.
If you would have helped me, she wouldn't have caught me.
If you hadn't twitched your nose, she wouldn't have caught you either.
Oh, good.
Here comes Mr. Kravitz.
He's trying to drag her in.
- Is he using a rope?
- No.
Mr. Henderson's got the rope.
They got her.
Sam, tomorrow morning you go over there and knock this crazy idea out of her head.
All right.
But it's not gonna be easy.
It just stopped raining.
Stove on.
Stove on.
- Stove on.
- Gladys.
It's coming.
Stove on.
Gladys, it is now 9:30.
We have been out here for two hours.
I want my breakfast.
- I command you to stand back.
- Did I hear right?
Did I hear right?
If my ears are lying, I should cut their tongues out.
Back.
I heard right.
I'm getting a doctor.
- I don't need a doctor.
- Then I'm getting a cook.
- Good morning.
- Oh, good morning.
Good morning.
Come on in and have some breakfast.
If you like your pancakes rare, you're in luck.
- Stove broken?
- Her head is broken.
- It's an experiment in psychokinetics.
- Listen to the big reader.
Mind over matter to the layman.
- Is it working?
- Not yet.
Well, I'm not surprised.
I did some reading after we talked.
This power isn't the kind of thing you can control, Mrs. Kravitz.
But the book said concentration is important.
- Lf you still have the power.
- But I do, don't I?
I guess not.
Lots of people have it for a little while and then it disappears.
Even scientists don't understand it.
Do they understand a man has to eat?
When it's gone, it's gone.
And there's nothing you can do about it.
Now, the stove might be too much.
Maybe I should try smaller things.
Start on the toaster.
How about the rain yesterday?
Now, I had the power then, didn't I?
Maybe.
But the paper did say there was a chance of showers.
You could have read that and been subconsciously influenced.
Listen to the smart girl, Gladys.
Turn on the stove.
You mean I might not have the power anymore?
- That's right.
- But it could come back.
I doubt it.
Meanwhile, turn on the stove, please.
Go ahead, Gladys, turn on the stove.
I never thought I'd beg to eat her cooking.
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thank you, honey.
Sure you don't want anything else?
No, this is fine.
Oh, by the way, I saw Mr. Kravitz turning on the sprinklers this morning.
- I guess Gladys kicked the habit.
- I had a little talk and convinced her.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Well, it's lucky for you that Mrs. Kravitz is forgetting this nonsense.
I hope you learned a lesson.
- Oh, Mr. Kravitz.
- Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
- What is it?
- She's doing it again.
She's worse than ever.
- Oh, no.
- We're standing in the market and she starts yelling a spirit is telling her we're in danger.
- Spirit?
- Of all days.
The whole neighbourhood was there.
We'll be a tourist attraction.
She really thinks she talked to a spirit?
I can't stand it anymore.
When is this all gonna end?
Tonight.
We're going to have a séance.
- Séance?
- Sam, that's ridiculous.
Please, Mr. Kravitz, this will cure her.
I know about these things.
- But something might happen.
- Lf it does, don't worry.
I've been to séances before.
Sometimes your mind plays tricks on you.
Oh, excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Kravitz?
Yes.
Yes.
All right, calm down.
- You better go home.
- What is it?
- She says she's getting vibrations.
- Vibrations?
She's chewing on the electric blanket again.
Now, what's all this business about a séance?
Don't you understand?
A séance will be the answer to all our problems.
Really?
How?
I'm gonna scare the daylights out of her.
I don't like this, Mrs. Stephens.
To tell you the truth, I'm scared.
It will be all right.
We've been waiting 20 minutes.
Maybe you better go get her.
No need for that.
I'm here, my son.
- You look lovely tonight, my dear.
- It's so good of you to come.
Are you ready to start now, Mrs. Kravitz?
Yes, my child.
Let us join hands.
First, we must empty our minds.
Erase everything.
Our minds must be clear.
Think of nothing.
I feel a presence in the room.
Someone in the room.
If you are here, make your presence known.
- It's here.
- There's nothing here.
That must be somebody at the front door.
Come in.
- Must be windy out.
- Mr. Kravitz, you're hurting my hand.
Maybe you better stop, Mrs. Kravitz.
Oh, not now.
We must all keep concentrating.
Mr. Kravitz, my hand.
Appear before me, great spirit.
Appear before me.
I'm begging you, Gladys, stop.
He's right, Mrs. Kravitz, maybe you better stop.
Oh, no, no.
No, I'm in control.
I'm in control.
Have no fear.
Appear, great spirit.
I'm not looking.
I'm not listening.
I'm closing the eyes, I'm covering the ears.
I see nothing.
It's a dream.
Appear, I say.
Appear.
Oh, Mrs. Kravitz, look what you've done.
You better stop before it's too late.
Oh, hi, Uncle Harold.
Abner, it's Uncle Harold.
Say hello.
You should not have disturbed me.
I am angry.
You're angry?
Some nerve.
He didn't even give us a wedding present.
Meddling in the unknown.
Heed my warning.
Stop.
He's right, stop.
Who said that?
That's enough, Gladys.
- Turn on the light.
- Quiet.
I'm gonna turn on the light.
I'm ending this whole thing.
Oh, dry up.
Mrs. Kravitz, what have you done?
I don't know.
I just told him to dry You did do that, didn't you?
Oh, Abner, forgive me.
Oh, please come back.
Oh, I shouldn't have started all this.
What can I do?
Whatever you do, don't sneeze.
If you swear off this magic forever, you may get him back.
Oh, I promise I'll never do it again.
I'll never do it again.
Oh, Abner, I love you.
Come back.
Oh, I swear, I'll never do it again.
I'll never do it again.
Oh, I swear.
I swear.
Oh, I swear.
Gladys?
What happened to Gladys?
Well, she fainted, but she'll be all right now.
That's right.
I'm sure you'll never have to worry about Gladys again.
- Oh, I'm gonna get some water.
- Good idea.
That will bring her around.
Oh, not for her, for me.
I feel like I'm all dried up.
- You all ready, sweetheart?
- Be ready in a minute, sweetheart.
I'll get the car.
- Hello.
- There he is.
- We just stopped by to return this.
- Well, thanks very much.
Oh, the chicken was delicious.
- I'm getting to be a marvellous cook.
- Good for you.
I say you can do anything if you put your mind to it.
Stop, we've had enough with the mind, Gladys.
Yes, I'm sure everyone is glad that other business is over with.
Oh, I never wanna go through another séance again.
Don't worry, you won't have to.
I'm through with that.
Good.
I'm taking Gladys to the Tivoli tonight.
- There's a good double bill.
- That's nice.
It's more than nice, it's strange.
It's remarkable.
He didn't say a word about it till now, and I was thinking the same thing.
Good night, Gladys.
Good night, folks.
Oh, Abner, wait, wait.
I have an idea.
Maybe we shouldn't go out tonight.
I can whip up something here.
- Great Scott, it's uncanny.
- What?
I was thinking the exact same thing.
Sam, do you think I have the power?
Yes but not that kind.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
At what time do you wish to officially begin our fun-filled Sunday?
- Like, say 11?
- Like, say 11 it is.
Let's sleep late, huh, sweetheart?
And in the afternoon we can do any crazy, wonderful thing we think of.
Roger.
Over and out.
Darrin, promise me, Eagle Scout's honour, you won't change your mind and wish you'd played golf tomorrow.
Promise.
Scout's honour.
Lovely morning.
Lovely.
Locked myself out.
It happens to me all the time.
- I'm afraid it was my fault.
- Your fault?
I distracted you when I said it was a lovely morning, remember?
Mr. Darrin Stephens, isn't it?
Oh, yes.
- I'm Pleasure O'Riley's baby sister.
- Well, son of a gun.
Holding down the fort while she's on her honeymoon.
Welcome to Morning Glory Circle, Miss D. D. O'Riley.
The first D stands for Dora, naturally too cube to use as my professional modelling name, so I added an extra big D. - And that stands for?
- Danger.
- Nice to meet you, Danger.
- It's nice to meet you, Darrin.
We seem to have a lot in common, don't we?
- How's that?
- We're both early risers.
Oh, that, yes.
I hate to wake Sam now My wife, but Oh, then don't.
I have coffee on, so that's no problem.
By the way, how do you like it?
Your coffee.
On the other hand, maybe I had better wake her.
Let her get her beauty sleep.
You have a choice.
Strawberry waffles or blueberry pancakes.
Blueberry pancakes?
You're kidding.
That's my favourite breakfast.
How about that?
It's a small world, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- Come on.
Darrin?
Sweetheart?
Good morning, darling.
Thank you for letting me sleep After Mom passed away and Pleasure went to work modelling I learned all I know about cooking from being a Camp Fire girl.
- Are they the way you like them?
- Delicious.
Thanks very much.
I just came over for some coffee.
- Can't let them go to waste, can we?
- Thank you very much.
- Hello.
- Hello.
This is Mrs. Stephens, your neighbour.
Is Mr. Stephens there?
Yes, he's right here.
How do you do, neighbour?
I'm Pleasure O'Riley's baby sister, Danger O'Riley.
Danger O'Ri?
Hello, Danger.
It certainly is a pleasure.
I felt guilty this morning when your husband got locked out because I distracted him while he was getting the paper.
I fed him breakfast to make up for it.
Naturally.
We didn't dare wake you while you were sleeping.
Boy, what an appetite this husband of yours has.
He's like a lion.
Yes, I know.
Good morning, honey.
Good morning, darling.
It seems you've started our fun-filled Sunday without me.
How long have you been baby-sister-sitting?
Just for a short while, dear.
I'll be right there and tell you about it - Look at the dishwasher.
- Oh, no.
Honey, there's an emergency.
The dam just broke.
I'll call you later.
Darrin?
- Where do you turn off your water?
- I don't know.
Well, where do you keep your mops?
Hello.
What's the latest bulletin from the flood area?
Gee, I'm sorry to borrow Darrin this long, Mrs. Stephens but the Jiffy Plumbing Company is just taking forever to get here.
Darrin is such a dream about helping me mop up the kitchen.
Isn't that sweet?
Sweetheart The trouble, you see, is it's Sunday.
Well, don't worry, Darrin.
Let's all wait a little longer, and it'll be Monday.
Yes Goodbye.
- Hello, George.
- Endora.
I hope I'm not interrupting your nice little party.
Not at all, I'm just resting.
What's the happy reason for this surprise visit?
It's your old playmate Samantha and I'm afraid it's not all that happy.
If you could have seen the sad look on the face of my poor lost child playing solitaire.
Samantha reduced to solitaire?
I don't believe it.
To Samantha, the only one that got away.
How my daughter can prefer that terrestrial existence to gracious living in a land of endless enchantment and married to that mundane mortal, is more than l - Warlock George.
- Endora.
You are giving birth to an idea of incredible devilment with me, I trust, in the star role?
I, Endora do beseech you, George, dream prince of mischief to rescue Samantha from suburbian solitaire by zeroing down on and wooing my delinquent witch daughter back to her senses.
A perfectly wizard notion Endora.
Shall I go as a wolf?
No.
It's too obvious.
Why not your old nimbus, the one that so inspired Edgar Allan Poe.
Wizard.
Solitaire for Samantha nevermore.
That's my boy.
Go on, go to it.
That's the way.
Sam, I am sorry about yesterday, but I obviously couldn't leave that kid all alone with the kitchen flooded.
How true.
I had no idea Jiffy Plumbing Company would take three hours to get there.
- That's probably Miss O'Riley now.
- Who else?
Sam, she doesn't have a car, and she has a very important modelling engagement.
I offered to give her a lift.
Well, you mustn't keep Lolita waiting.
Gee, Darrin, I hate to rush, but would you mind hurrying?
I'm almost late.
Hi, Mrs. Stephens.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
Anything I can bring you tonight?
Yes, a new deck of cards.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, darling.
- George.
Well, I should've known.
- Hi there, Cinderella.
Your prince charming has come to take you to the ball we used to have.
- What are you doing here, George?
- What are you doing here, Samantha?
- I live here.
- You merely exist here.
I felt the vibrations of your unhappiness all the way up there.
So I decided to swoop down like Lochinvar and Like Lucifer.
Listen, my fine-feathered friend I'm not supposed to be happy every minute.
I'm married.
Got the message.
I decided to rescue you from your gilded, domestic cage.
George, for old times' sake, do me one last favour.
Disappear.
With you by my side, wild heart.
Forget it, George.
I'd rather be a contented Earth woman married to a mortal any day.
And that's that.
Samantha, I've been put on this earth for one purpose: To eliminate your stale negatives and accentuate your old bewitching positives.
George, what?
George, please.
Basic black.
Now, that suits you.
Okay.
Bye-bye, blackbird.
Unfold those gossamer wings and fly back home to my mama, who put you up to this.
Oh, Mother, when are you going to stop?
This is my life, and I am deliriously happy, married to that normal kind, loving only-on-occasion-thoughtful human, Darrin Stephens.
- I give up.
- You do?
- Before I leave - You will vanish this instant.
Otherwise, I will be forced to use drastic methods.
What kind of magic is that supposed to be?
This is a wedding ring.
Good.
Hi there, birdie.
Cute little bird.
Bye-bye, birdie.
Well, then, how about this, fellas?
"Here's the key to your secretary's happiness a new electric Feather Touch typewriter".
- Well, Darrin, so far - So bad.
I wouldn't say that, Stephens.
- A layout like that could be very - Adequate, Porterfield?
If the client marks us mediocre, we can say bye-bye to the Feather Touch account.
So all McMann & Tate has to do is come up with a new sales campaign that's merely brilliant.
They will sign that new deal for 2 million in gross billings.
Feather Touch.
Feather Touch.
A brand-new electric typewriter that requires a new image for billboards along freeways magazine copy, television commercials.
An eye-grabbing trademark that will talk to the customer.
And when we find the perfect image, it could be under our nose.
Darrin, you have a match?
- Will you look at that bird?
- I'm looking.
Right under our noses?
Darrin boy, are you thinking what I'm thinking?
Larry boy, I am thinking what you're thinking.
What a perfect product image for a series of TV commercials.
Will you look at that crazy crow?
That sweet bird, play that keyboard like music from a cash register.
Boys, the copy should write itself.
"We're raven about Feather Touch.
You will too".
A cartoon balloon from the raven's mouth, Edgar Allan Poe style: "Nevermore any problems for your secretary".
I'll buy that, until you can think of something better.
Miss Thatcher, will you come in please?
Will you find a pet shop that's open and order a large cage for this raven and a sack of their best birdseed?
Mr. Stephens will pick it up.
Yes, sir.
- Did I hear you right, Mr. Tate?
- You heard me right, Miss Thatcher.
Go.
Gentlemen, I like this bird.
He'll be a credit to Madison Avenue.
Look at him.
- There, in all his commercial glory - Piquant bankable charm Stands our new Feather Touch trademark.
Go to work, Darrin.
It's your account.
From now on, this bird is your baby.
- Samantha?
Sam?
- Yes, darling?
Surprise, surprise, we have a houseguest.
You'll never guess who.
Danger O'Riley.
Oh, come on, honey.
It's our new $2 million trademark for the Feather Touch account.
Ta-da!
A fantastic raven.
Wait till you see the tricks he does.
You'll never believe it.
Maybe I will.
Do everything you can to keep him happy, won't you?
If our brainstorm works out and the sketches I intend to make tonight jell - Tonight?
Here?
- Yeah.
- Is there a window open someplace?
- In the bedroom.
I better close it before I let him out.
I think our bedroom closet might be the safest place for him to sleep.
I don't think so.
How about that?
He also croaks "Bird in a Gilded Cage".
I intend to catch him in all his cute moods.
You've caught him in one right now.
Darrin, I wanna talk to you.
Come down here right away.
- Darrin, this is no ordinary bird.
- You're right, he's a genius.
Honey, don't tell me you're afraid of this charming fella.
Look at that.
How can you resist him?
It's easy.
Okay, genius, the jig's up.
Darrin, you're entitled to the truth.
I used to date this funny bird.
Darrin Stephens, I'd like you to meet George the mischief-making home-wrecker.
Charmed to meet you in the flesh, advertising man.
But he How could he?
Why did he?
Honey, Larry and I, we I gotta get another bird!
Oh, Sam, am I losing my mind?
No, you're not, and you're not losing me either.
I give you my word that my meddling mother is not going to break up this human home.
All right, Endora, where are you hiding?
Let's have this out right now, face to face.
Oh, let's.
- Just when is this going to stop?
- Now, now, Darrin there's no need to shout and get yourself all upset.
Upset?
Will you be quiet for a minute?
Can't you see how happy we are?
Doesn't that mean anything?
All I've seen lately is that fun Sunday you didn't have with my daughter.
You turned her into the solitaire champion of the universe.
Yesterday could not be helped.
It was an accident.
Danger O'Riley.
Some accident.
I'll take care of you later.
No, look, Endora, I realize that into every life a little rain must fall, but this is ridiculous.
You have personally set back the mother-in-law business 200 years.
- Mother.
- What?
For my sake, will you please go and take this big loon with you?
Good.
If you don't get out, I'm gonna throw you out.
Darrin, don't.
- That's in bad taste, George.
- I think he's kind of cute.
- Tell the truth, I like him better that way.
- George, please.
Darrin, would you answer that?
Darrin, I hope I'm not disturbing you, but do you know what I just did?
You agreed to sell Girl Scout cookies door to door.
No.
I had a roast in the oven, and I was opening the door and it just fell off and went just like that.
I hate to impose on you.
I see you're entertaining.
Our guest was just leaving.
Then do you mind, Mrs. Stephens, if Darrin tries to fix it?
He's so handy.
May I volunteer to aid a beautiful lady in distress?
Samantha may be the world's greatest solitaire player but I happened to have majored in oven doors at Oxford.
You did?
Danger O'Riley, I'd like you to meet George Raven.
George Raven.
What a funny name.
But it's awfully sweet of you.
Bye.
- Isn't that sweet?
- I'm not so sure.
I just opened the oven door, and it went just like that.
Just like that.
Hey, aren't you Mr. Wonderful?
And you learned it all at Oxford, Mr. Raven.
Soda or water?
Soda, please.
Sam, will you look at this?
I think she's invited that big spook to stay till dinner.
I invited you to dinner once, remember?
What's wrong with a witch being attracted to a mortal?
You did the honourable thing.
You told me what you were so I was able to cope with this This Copeless situation.
- Miss O'Riley?
- Yes, Mr. Raven?
You're a sweet human being along with being very beautiful.
Even though you're from Oxford, you needn't be so formal.
Call me Danger if you like.
Well, I like.
But you may change your mind when you find out that I'm a warlock.
Oh, well - You are?
- Yes.
Well, so?
This is a free country, isn't it?
Anyone has the right to go to the church of their choice.
Look, Sam Can't we try to be adult about this situation?
I'm game.
You start.
Come on, Sam, it's only natural to be concerned when a naive kid like Danger O'Riley - Naive?
My fat Aunt Harriett.
I didn't know you had an Aunt Harriett.
"Warlock.
Deceiver, a breaker of his word a name for the devil, a male witch".
- A monster, malicious imp, demon.
Aren't you being too hard on yourself, George?
Nobody's perfect.
Miss O'Riley, you are a true innocent.
At this stage of our budding relationship, gallantry impels me to demonstrate the dangerous extent of my powers.
Hey!
That's very good, George.
I think I know how it's done.
I used to go with a magician.
He taught me this one.
See?
I didn't go with him very long.
What are you going to do?
If you won't warn that kid she's entertaining a warlock, I will.
I wouldn't do that if l - You're not.
- Hi again, Stephenses.
We found each other.
Would you like to help us celebrate?
I destroyed your campaign, chum.
The least I can do is repair your spirit.
I can always find a new bird, but talking about spirits Did you tell her, George?
Oh, sure, he tried to put me off with all those little tricks.
But I say when a person is attracted to another one, why fight it?
George, you failed me.
Endora, you can't win them all.
Whatever happened to your old black magic, your old fatal charm?
Let's face it, his was stronger than mine.
Or words to that effect.
Now will you ever doubt that I love you only?
Nevermore.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
On your way out?
If you want to mak e sure you have a good time, stop.
Go to the nearest mirror and tak e a good look at yourself.
Are you really attractive?
I mean, as attractive as you can be?
We don't think so.
Maybe it's your hair.
Yes, hair.
Ever wanted to see yourself as a flaming redhead?
We think you can be a knock out.
We can mak e you anything you want to be.
Remember, if you don't lik e the result, you can easily rinse it out.
U se our brand of magic.
Even your neighbours won't recognize you.
Perhaps you'd be happier as a brunette.
We guarantee you'll be a knock out in any colour with Tortoise and Hare, H-A-R-E, colour preparations.
It's the old story of the tortoise and the hare.
Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
I ran out of sugar and I wondered if - Something the matter?
- Your hair changed colour.
- It's a wig.
- You sure got it on fast.
- What happened to the mirror there?
- What mirror?
Well, I was sure I saw a mirror, and you were looking Mrs. Kravitz, why don't we go into the kitchen?
I'll get you your sugar.
Does your husband like your hair like that?
Well, he hasn't seen it yet.
I want it to be a surprise.
He doesn't like you as a blond?
Well, it isn't that.
I think that every man likes a little variety in his daily life, don't you?
Besides, it's easy to become bored with the same old face.
You may be right.
Come to think of it, Abner hasn't been his old self lately.
You sure one cup's gonna be enough?
He doesn't even kiss me good night anymore.
Last night he just shook my hand.
Well, some people have different ways of showing affection.
It wasn't even a friendly handshake.
Excuse me.
- Hello?
- Hi, honey.
- Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Everything okay?
- Sure, why?
I thought something had gone wrong, and you couldn't make it.
I wouldn't let anything interfere with tonight.
I wanted to ask you to bring that mystery story I was reading.
I'll put it in with the things I packed.
I'll meet you in the hotel lobby at 6:00.
At 6.
Bye, sweetheart.
Bye.
You going away someplace?
Darrin and I are spending the night at the President Hotel.
- We do that once in a while.
- What for?
To get away from the drudgery of everyday life.
We relax, have dinner in our room, get to know each other again without having to worry about phones that ring, dishes to wash.
- You know how it is.
- I'm trying to remember.
You mean Mr. Stephens goes for that romantic stuff?
I don't think he'd want any of his friends to know but just between us, I think he enjoys it.
I've got to hand it to you, Mrs. Stephens.
You certainly know how to keep the magic in your marriage.
Well, I keep trying.
I thought we'd use a distinctive motif in the campaign, Larry.
I have a few sketches in the office I'd like you to take a look at.
Larry?
- Pretty girl.
- I've a couple of ideas on the subject.
- So have I. - I was thinking of the campaign.
All the letters for you to sign are on your desk.
Thanks, Ellen.
Here, take a look at these, Larry.
See what you think.
Larry?
Larry, will you put your eyeballs back and take a look at these?
Look, just because I'm married doesn't mean I'm dead.
Very frustrating when I think of all that charm and sex appeal going to waste.
- Ellen's?
- No, mine.
You talk a great game, but I think you're a sheep in wolf's clothing.
- Will you please take a look at these?
- We can go over them on the train.
- No, I'm staying in town tonight.
- Yeah?
Look, I'm half planning on meeting Louise in town.
Give Sam a call, and we could make a night of it.
No, I'm afraid we can't make it tonight.
I have something to take care of.
There's nothing pressing here, is there?
No, it's a personal matter.
Maybe some other time, huh?
Yes?
Sure, put her on.
It's for you.
Louise.
Hi, honey.
Decided on what you wanna do yet?
- I don't care.
What do you wanna do?
- I don't know.
What do you wanna do?
Anything.
But you make up your mind.
I'll do anything you wanna do.
- Okay, let's go to a ball game.
- No, I don't wanna do that.
Since I'm already in town, why don't I go to the ball game on my own.
Well, okay.
Maybe I'll give Samantha a call and drop over there.
You do that, and I'll pick you up over there later.
- Want company for dinner?
- Sorry, Larry.
I have an appointment.
Well, see you tomorrow.
- Yes?
- The President Hotel just called and confirmed your reservations for tonight.
All right.
Did you say Darrin had reservations at the President Hotel?
Yes, sir.
Why, that son of a gun.
- I beg your pardon?
- That boy deserves an Oscar.
- He had me completely convinced.
- Who?
Never mind.
That son of a gun.
- Got a light?
- Sure.
My, you do have strong hands.
I beg your pardon.
Sam.
What have you done to yourself?
- What do you think of the new me?
- Well, I don't know.
I don't think the old model is quite obsolete yet.
Thank you, darling.
- Bleachers?
That all you got?
- Afraid so, Mr. Tate.
But I'll freeze without a coat.
Yeah, but it should be a great game.
Not worth pneumonia.
I think I'll skip it.
That son of a gun.
- There.
That better?
- Much.
- What did you do with the wig?
- Oh, easy come, easy go.
How could I ever possibly become interested in anyone else?
- What brought that on?
- Never mind.
Sam, can I ask you a hypothetical question?
- Yes, I'd know.
- What?
If you became interested in another woman.
You really have that sort of power?
That's for me to know, and you better not try and find out.
Do you wanna watch some TV?
No, I thought I'd finish that mystery story I was reading.
I only have three chapters left to go.
Where is it, honey?
- I knew I'd forgotten something.
- I specifically asked you to bring it.
Well, there's no problem.
I'll pop home and get it.
- It'll only take a minute.
- Never mind.
You want to know who the murderer is, don't you?
- Well - Only be a second.
Sometimes I think I'm married to Peter Pan.
Well, Larry, what are you doing here?
- Isn't Louise here?
- No, she isn't.
That's funny.
I guess she decided to stay home after all.
Well, I'm sorry, Sam.
I guess I disturbed you.
Oh, I wasn't going to bed.
As a matter of fact, I was just gonna get dressed and go out.
At this time of night?
I thought I'd surprise Darrin.
He's working late at the office.
I thought I'd pick him up, and we could get something to eat.
Can I offer you some coffee or something?
No, no, thanks, Sam.
I have some business to attend to.
- Bye.
- Good night.
Abner!
I've got a surprise!
- Hi there.
- Hi.
You've had your nose stuck in that book all day.
I wanna see how it turns out.
It's about the Civil War.
The North won.
Let me find out for myself.
- Abner?
- What is it, Gladys?
I want you to look at me.
So?
I'm looking.
But you're not seeing me.
You haven't really looked at me in years.
I don't have to.
I already committed you to memory.
Abner, don't you notice something different?
Oh, you bought new shoes?
Did you find out who done it?
Wouldn't have been able to sleep if I hadn't.
- What's a seven-letter word?
- Darrin, open up.
- It's Larry.
How did he know?
- Oops.
I'd better make myself scarce.
Sam.
Honey, you don't have to hide.
- You son of a gun.
- What?
I should've known.
The quiet ones are always the worst.
- Have you been drinking, Larry?
- Come on, Darrin.
I saw the brunette downstairs.
Brunette?
Oh, that brunette.
That was Samantha.
Boy, you never give up, do you?
I'm telling you, that was Samantha.
Come on, Darrin.
I saw her with my own eyes.
Now, you come on, Larry.
Samantha?
Samantha?
- Come on out.
Appear before me.
- This is silly.
- Let's go, Sam.
Come on.
- You don't have to put on an act for me.
Darrin, I was just at your house talking to Sam.
I don't care if you You were what?
Yeah, 20 minutes ago.
I drove here like a maniac.
You gonna tell me Sam can be in two places at the same time?
No, I'm not gonna tell you that.
You son of a gun.
Well, you got me, Larry.
Yeah, you're right.
- Nobody's perfect, right?
- Right.
I hate to be inhospitable, but, you know.
Sure.
- I better tell you why I'm here.
- Why?
Sam's on her way to the office.
So if I were you, I'd get on over there.
Thanks, thanks a lot.
You son of a gun.
Oh, great.
Samantha?
Samantha!
I'm not sure I like his attitude.
It's entirely too French.
- Why didn't you tell me you saw Larry?
- You never asked.
- The doorbell rang, so I answered it.
- Did you have to answer it?
How could I possibly know it was Larry?
I thought you were pretty good at that.
- You needn't get huffy.
- What am I gonna tell him?
If I tell him the truth, he's liable to suspect that you're a You know.
Go ahead, Darrin.
You can say it.
You're among friends.
Witch.
Samantha, Larry's eaten up with curiosity.
He's not going to stop until he finds out who the other woman is.
Darling, you've done nothing to be ashamed of.
There's nothing wrong with being interested in two women as long as they're both your wife.
I meant to tell you.
The other night, instead of going to Samantha's I went with Mabel to the high school play.
Her son was very good.
- Larry, are you listening to me?
- Sure I am.
Anyway, on the way home, we were attacked by two masked bandits knocked unconscious and shipped to the casbah.
Glad you had a nice time, dear.
Don't you think it's undignified for a man your age to have a subscription to a magazine like that?
- It has some very interesting articles.
- Sure, and they all fold out.
I meant it has intellectual content.
You mean the girls wear glasses?
Louise, every man likes to look at pretty girls.
It's a normal, healthy American pastime.
Something you wives don't understand.
Because it's not true.
Some men grow up.
Name one.
Well, Darrin, for one.
I bet he doesn't ogle girls.
Well, Darrin's not as perfect as you think.
You mean he buys magazines like that?
- He doesn't have to.
- Because he's married to Samantha?
I mean Of course, that's what I meant.
No, you didn't.
What are you trying to hide?
Why do you think I'm trying to hide something?
Your skull is moving back and forth.
It does that when you're hiding something.
Louise, you can question me all night, and you'll never find out a thing.
Darrin?
Now can I go to sleep?
You actually saw this brunette?
Louise, if you breathe a word of this to anyone, I'II I'll cut off your charge accounts.
Poor Samantha.
Especially to Samantha.
Now repeat after me: I promise I will not mention this to Samantha.
Oh, Larry.
- Say it.
- Okay.
I promise I will not mention this to Samantha.
Hello, Samantha?
- Yes, this is Samantha.
- May I speak to Darrin, please?
Is that you, Louise?
How are you, dear?
How have you been feeling?
- Oh, just fine.
- I want you to know you're not alone.
You always have friends if you need them.
Well, thank you, Louise.
I'll get Darrin.
- I think she knows.
- Did she say so?
No, but she's treating me as if you just died.
I don't see how she could know.
Hello, Louise.
- Good morning, bluebeard.
- She knows.
I realise you can't talk, so just listen.
Meet me in the lobby of the President Hotel this afternoon at 3:00.
And promise not to tell Larry.
I want to talk some sense into you.
Goodbye.
What'd she say?
She's determined to save our marriage.
I don't like this, Samantha.
Well, neither do I. I guess there's only one thing you can do.
Tell her you're a witch?
No.
Listen to her, look guilty and promise to give her up.
- Her?
- The other woman.
Obviously, one of me has got to go.
Abner, I'm home.
Well, don't you have anything to say?
Did you remember to get my corn plasters?
Put that flute down.
I wanna talk to you.
Abner, don't you ever think of romance anymore?
Gladys, please.
I'm retired.
We've got to face facts.
Now, over the years we've come to take each other for granted.
We should do something about it.
What have you got in mind?
I've made a reservation at a hotel downtown.
We'll spend the weekend there.
Away from the drudgery of everyday living.
We'll relax and really get to know each other again.
How about it, Abner?
I don't know.
It seems like a lot of trouble just to save a marriage.
Besides, I know you well enough already.
No, you don't.
Look at me carefully.
There's something different about me.
What is it?
Is it animal, vegetable or mineral?
Darrin in his office?
No, he left the building about 10 minutes ago.
At 3 in the afternoon?
Did he say where he's going, or when he'd be back?
- No, he didn't.
- I've got to get hold of him.
Look, get Mrs. Stephens on the phone.
I'll take it here.
- Hello?
- Sam, this is Larry.
Do you know where Darrin is?
Why?
Is something wrong?
We had a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning.
I heard from the client.
He has to leave for the West Coast tonight.
He wanted the meeting pushed up to 4 this afternoon.
Unfortunately, I can't find Darrin.
You might try paging him in the lobby of the President Hotel.
- The President Hotel?
- Yes, he's meeting someone there.
- Thanks, Sam.
- You're welcome, Larry.
Bye.
I know people have trouble adjusting in their first year of marriage, but You're right.
I promise to give her up.
It was just one of those things.
- I better get back to the office.
- Sit down.
I'm not through with you yet.
Now, you know, I wouldn't be here, Darrin, if I weren't very fond of you.
I realise that, Louise.
Louise.
Abner?
- What did you do to your head?
- You noticed.
Who wouldn't?
It looks like you stuck your finger in a light socket.
- You didn't before.
- Before what?
When I wore the platinum wig and the blond wig.
Well, I couldn't notice that.
I'm colour-blind.
- Colour-blind?
- You knew that.
That's wonderful.
I thought you didn't care, but you were only colour-blind.
I'll get your medicine, Gladys.
- Hi, Larry.
- You philanderer, you.
No wonder you wouldn't tell me what the girl's name was.
- Why - No, no, don't try to lie about it.
All the pieces have fallen into place to make a horrible picture.
You're supposed to be liberal-minded about this sort of thing, right?
You go near Louise again, and you're fired.
What is this?
An old witch's cure?
Nope, a young witch's cure, called beefsteak.
I'm worried about this whole plan.
We've got to do something to patch up your friendship with Larry.
Also, I can't let something I did come between Larry and Louise.
Can't we just tell him our story instead of staging this ridiculous scene?
Certainly.
All you have to do is say, "Larry, my wife is a w" - Forget it.
- Where's Larry now?
In his office.
- Louise should be here any minute.
- Good.
Hi, honey.
I love the way your face lights up when I enter a room.
What do you expect?
What's the matter?
You look like you just lost your best friend.
Who cares about that?
Are you coming down with something?
Maybe you need a shot.
That's the best idea I've heard all day.
Larry, you wanna tell me what's bothering you?
Louise, where were you today?
- You found out, huh?
- Yes, I found out.
Darn.
I specifically told Darrin not to mention it to you.
Is that all you've got to say?
Well, it is rather disappointing.
I mean, who can you trust these days?
Oh, Louise.
- What's that?
- I don't know.
- Darrin, you promised.
- Promised what?
- Hello there.
- Hi.
I don't even wanna talk to you, you, you, you - Samantha?
- Who else would be kissing Darrin?
Darrin, what happened to your eye?
Yes, what happened to your eye, Darrin?
- Larry hit me.
- Who?
You.
He thought you were the other woman in the hotel room.
He thought what?
Oh, darling.
You've just made my day.
I told you I went to the high school play with Mabel but, as usual, you weren't listening.
I still have the program.
I believe you.
Louise met Darrin in the hotel this afternoon because she believed what you told her.
She thought she'd be able to help.
But you promised me you wouldn't say anything to Samantha.
Now look at the mess you've cau - Oh, forget it.
- I have an idea.
- Good.
- Why don't we all go out and celebrate?
I'll buy that.
You must let me try your wig on sometime later.
I don't think it'll fit, Louise.
It was custom-made for my head.
Just a moment.
How did Samantha get from your house to the hotel in less than 20 minutes?
She She's a witch.
You son of a gun.
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
Okay, now you can open.
Champagne, what's the occasion?
The occasion is our first quiet evening at home in two weeks.
I intend to toast you in blank verse and whisper sweet nothings till sunrise.
Aren't you sweet?
First, we remove the protective wiring.
Then we pry loose the cork with a resounding Chime.
Who dares intrude on blank verse and sweet nothings?
I don't know.
But we're gonna get rid of whoever it is in a hurry.
Oh, Mr. Kravitz.
- Evening, Mrs. Stephens, Mr. Stephens.
- Good evening.
I dropped by to give you some neighbourhood gossip.
Well, could you tell us tomorrow, Mr. Kravitz?
- It's late, and we were - Mrs. Kravitz and I just split up.
Oh, no.
We had a championship fight.
Round one began with a dispute over which drawer I should keep my socks in.
Round 10 ended with me storming out of the house to go to my club.
Why don't go to your club?
I was so mad, I didn't realise I don't have one.
Until I was out the door which Mrs. Kravitz childishly locked behind me.
And when I rang the bell, she didn't open it.
She probably didn't hear you.
Why don't you go back and?
I rang 20 minutes nonstop.
I said, "Gladys, let me in, I'll catch pneumonia".
- And she didn't answer?
- She answered.
She gave me the name of a good doctor.
Would you care to plead with her on the phone?
No, I refuse to stoop to her level of immaturity.
I'll sleep in the gutter.
She'll find her sole source of support frozen, dead.
You'll do no such thing.
You'll stay in our guest room.
Come morning, when tempers have subsided you and Mrs. Kravitz will make up.
You're both very kind.
Tough luck, Gladys.
I'm going to live.
Would you care to join us in a glass of champagne?
- Thanks, but not at bedtime.
- Oh, all right, Mr. Kravitz.
The guest room is the door to the left, on the top of the stairs.
At bedtime, I drink piping hot cocoa, if it's not too much trouble.
Oh, no.
No trouble at all.
Hurry back, honey, before the champagne gets cold.
Coming, darling.
Oh, boy.
That Mr. Kravitz sure is a good sleeper.
He's also a good snorer with amazing long-range reverberations.
There was a fleeting moment around 3 a. M when I thought we were under attack by enemy aircraft.
In a way, it's kind of cute.
Cute?
There is nothing cute about staying awake all night listening to stereophonic snoring.
I meant it's cute that after a couple can still have a lovers' quarrel.
- You think that's all it is?
- Oh, of course.
And in the clear light of day, they'll both see how ridiculous it is.
That must be the lady in question come to claim her lost sheep.
Well, say "baa-baa" to her lost sheep.
I'll clean up those things later.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
- Good morning.
Won't you come in?
Something the matter?
To the naked eye this looks like the average American home.
Mrs. Stephens, are you by any chance harbouring my husband?
Yes, I hope you don't mind.
It was very late and he didn't have Don't apologise, this is a free country.
Oh, don't tell me you're going home to mother.
These are Mr. Kravitz's clothes.
Tell him he can keep his socks anyplace he chooses.
Mrs. Kravitz, do you seriously?
The home is half mine.
Why should I move and leave it to him?
- Let him move and leave it to me.
- Mrs. Kravitz, do you seriously?
He can keep the car, I'll keep the house.
I'll try again.
Mrs. Kravitz, do you seriously mean?
I do.
The 30-year partnership of Abner and Gladys Kravitz is finished, washed up, dissolved.
Just because of a pair of socks?
- Now, Mrs. Kravitz, I know your - The socks is just a symbol.
- A symbol of what?
- Of Mr. Kravitz's crummy neuroses.
He's neurotic, you know.
Oh, he's so neurotic that a normal person like you A normal person like me might what?
Nothing, I forgot to whom I was speaking.
Would you give Mr. Kravitz this note?
Tell him if he wishes to reply to it to have his attorney contact my attorney.
Pardon me, ladies, but I have to go to work.
- Where's Mrs. Kravitz?
- She left.
- Alone?
- Alone.
Darrin, this is much more serious than you predicted.
- I didn't predict anything.
- She's contemplating divorce.
That was the best sleep I've had in months.
Mrs. Kravitz snores.
Mr. Kravitz, I'm afraid I have some bad news.
No fresh orange juice?
- No.
- Hey, that's my suitcase.
How about that.
It's packed.
What did Mrs. Kravitz say when she brought it over?
She left you this note.
This is shocking.
She has the penmanship of a 10-year-old child.
Never mind the penmanship.
What does it say?
It says, "Farewell forever".
If you don't have fresh orange juice, I'll have half a grapefruit.
We have fresh orange juice.
We have fresh orange juice every morning.
Mr. Kravitz, why aren't you pounding your head in misery?
- Because I'm not miserable.
- Well, you should be.
If I wrote you a "farewell forever" note, wouldn't you be miserable?
I certainly would.
Because she's my wife, and Mrs. Kravitz is your wife.
I know, wanna trade?
I'll give you Gladys and 18 pairs of socks.
Mr. Kravitz, we're disappointed in you.
Aren't you gonna fight for her?
I'm undecided, it depends on how much I enjoy not fighting with her.
I'll get dressed for breakfast.
Shouldn't you go to work?
Yes, and so should you.
- What does that mean?
- You should go to work getting Mr. Kravitz back where he belongs before I get home tonight.
- How?
- I haven't the faintest idea.
But being a devoted wife and witch, I'm sure you'll think of something.
- Know what I mean?
- Darrin.
Sweetheart, I'm home.
Come give me a passionate kiss.
Okay, pucker up.
That's passionate?
Mr. Kravitz, may I speak to my wife alone for a minute, please?
Sure, I'll start the Brussels sprouts.
Sweetheart, when I left this morning, l Brussels sprouts?
He said if it wasn't too much trouble, he'd like to show me a special recipe.
I hate Brussels sprouts.
Well, he likes them and he's our guest.
Why?
When I left this morning, I asked you to make him disappear.
No.
You asked me to get him back where he belongs.
That's much harder than making him disappear.
Make him disappear from our house and appear in his house.
Wouldn't do any good.
He'd see where he was and come right back.
Samantha, you're stalling.
- Well - You've used your powers to solve much tougher problems than this.
Since when do you want me to use witchcraft?
You always want me not to.
- That's true, however - However what?
- I'm willing to make an exception.
- Mrs. Stephens.
- Yes?
- Lf it's not too much trouble where do I find the anchovies?
- Second cabinet to the right.
Thank you.
- Why does he need anchovies?
- To stuff the Brussels sprouts.
Make him disappear from our house and appear in San Francisco.
Darrin, our aim isn't merely to get rid of him, it's to reunite him with his wife.
Send her to San Francisco too.
They have to reunite on their own free will.
Of course, I suppose I could go and see Mrs. Kravitz and try to reason with her, wife to wife.
- When?
- Now?
Fine.
Good luck.
Brussels sprouts.
- Mrs. Kravitz, l - There's been an accident!
Mrs. Kravitz, your husband is in perfectly good health.
- Scout's honour?
- Scout's honour.
I'm sorry to hear it.
Could we go in and sit down and have a little talk?
Why not.
If Mr. Kravitz asked you to beg me to forgive him, you're wasting your time.
He didn't beg me, Mrs. Kravitz.
As a matter of fact, he doesn't even know.
I'm doing very nicely without him.
I like this peace and quiet.
L - I was gonna throw that in the garbage.
- Oh, were you?
Or were you looking at it because you miss him?
Absolutely not.
I wouldn't miss him with a 10-foot pole.
I like this peace and quiet.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, I miss him so much I don't know what to do.
I'm an unhappy ship floating down a Ionely river.
And this is my ninth handkerchief today!
Oh, Mrs. Kravitz.
I am sorry.
I'll tell Mr. Kravitz to come home right away.
Over my dead body!
I want him to want to come home.
I want him to get on his hands and knees and say he can't live without me.
What if he's too stubborn to admit it?
I'll kill him.
Oh, I see.
You have just as much pride as he.
And he's the man so it's up to him to make the first move.
I stand on that principle, is that unreasonable?
No, Mrs. Kravitz, I can't say that it is.
What would you say to a little compromise plan?
- By whom?
- By me and our mutual living-room windows.
I just took a king.
You're not concentrating.
I was still thinking about the Brussels sprouts stuffed with anchovies.
Gin.
Guess who I can see from here.
Why, it's Mrs. Kravitz.
Loser deals.
She has a new hairdo.
Oh, yes.
I noticed, very becoming.
Did you see her negligee?
Oh, yes.
Very dainty and feminine.
That's enough shuffling.
Deal.
Boy, when Mrs. Abner Kravitz puts her mind to it she sure can look appealing.
I don't want it, do you?
Gin.
On the first card?
- What luck.
- It wasn't luck.
It was skill.
I'm not a man given to rash statements but Abner Kravitz, alias the Brussels Sprouts Kid has been our houseguest for two nights.
And this is the second day, and I have had it.
Which upsets you more the sonic-boom snoring or the Brussels sprouts?
What I object to most is the invasion of our privacy.
I'd always hoped our family would be enlarged.
- But what I had in mind was a baby.
- Well, cheer up, we've got one.
A middle-aged bouncing baby boy.
He misses his wife just as much as his wife misses him.
He'd go back to her in a second if his ego weren't playing a silly game of who's gonna crack first.
I'll tell you who's gonna crack first.
I am.
- Darrin.
- Good morning, my genial hosts.
Good morning.
Mrs. Stephens, if it isn't too much trouble would you mind taking my shirts in your delivery to the laundry?
Thanks.
Mr. Kravitz, I have observed that whenever you ask my wife to do you a favour, you always finish or start with: - "If it's not too much trouble".
- And I end with "thank you".
- I always try to be polite.
- That is very admirable.
However, there are certain requests that are too much trouble.
Now, not at all, darling.
Mr. Kravitz, you just set them down over there.
- I'll be happy to take them for you.
- Thanks.
Oh, Mr. Stephens?
- What?
- You had the paper first yesterday.
It's my paper, isn't it?
Okay, if that's your attitude, I'll get my paper.
Excuse me.
How do you do, madam?
I represent the Wet Rose - Kiss me.
- I beg your pardon?
Kiss me, I wanna make my husband jealous.
Lady, don't go to extremes.
If you don't wanna buy, just slam the door in my face.
- Darrin?
- What?
Can you sleep?
No.
Neither can I. Bet I know why.
- Why?
- We've gotten so adjusted to Mr. Kravitz snoring, that the one night he doesn't it keeps us awake.
That's probably it.
Doesn't make any sense, but that's probably it.
Sort of at a standstill, aren't we?
- Do you have any ideas?
- No.
Do you?
Yes, but it's only half an idea.
Now, since we can't seem to reunite the Kravitzs' while they're awake perhaps I can reunite them while they're asleep.
Sounds logical.
I thought if, by witchcraft I gave each of them the same dream at the same time Go ahead, I'm listening.
That's all.
That's why it's only half an idea.
A dream that would make them realise how much they love each other.
So when they woke up, they'd rush into each others' arms.
Exactly.
Suggest a dream.
You suggest a dream.
It's your half an idea.
It should be about a time when they were both blissfully happy.
Like when they were single.
- That's perfect.
- Sam, I was being sarcastic.
That's absolutely perfect.
When is the happiest day in a man's life in relation to his wife before they were married?
When he finds out she isn't going to need $3000 worth of dental work.
Wrong.
The day he proposes and she accepts.
It's the happiest day for her too.
- Possibly, but - Possibly?
- Wasn't it the happiest day for you?
- I guess so.
Yes, it was.
Same here.
So that's what I'll do.
I'll make them both dream of his proposal Don't go away.
I'll be right back.
Abner and Gladys Kravitz sweet dreams.
- How was your class in home ec?
- Oh, keen.
- How was your class in business ed?
- Keen.
But my favourite class is Scandinavian lit.
- So's mine.
- Why?
You tell me first.
My favourite class is Scandinavian lit because in it I sit next to a certain Miss Gladys Gruber.
Gladys Gruber, some name.
I think it's beautiful.
It's too guttural.
Gladys Gruber, Gladys Gruber.
- Maybe you'd like to change it.
- Change it to what?
To Gladys Kravitz.
I admit, it isn't much of an improvement, but Gladys, I love you.
I've loved you since you fell off the truck on my fraternity hayride.
I want you to be my wife.
To travel my life highway sharing my joys and sorrows.
Abner, is this a proposal?
If it wasn't a proposal, would I have bought this?
It's keen!
You got your fingers over the diamond.
I wanted to buy you a diamond as big as my heart.
But they don't make one.
- Even if they did, I couldn't afford it.
- This is big enough.
My needs are simple.
Kindness, understanding a nice winter coat.
Does that mean the answer is yes?
- Didn't you know it would be?
- Well, I wasn't sure.
I only hoped.
As the years glide swiftly by our love will bloom in beauty, like a rose.
The end.
Now, all I have to do is wake them up and let them take it by themselves from here.
- Fascinating.
- What?
- Being married to you.
- Oh, good.
- Will it work?
- I hope so.
Gladys!
Where are you?
Abner.
Abner, where are you?
Now Let's go look out the window.
- At what?
- At their reunion.
- Abner!
- Gladys!
- You know what might be a nice touch?
- What?
The way they do it in the movies.
Well that's that.
- Congratulations.
I started the ball rolling.
It wouldn't work if they didn't love each other.
- As much as we do?
Maybe.
No.
No, that is impossible.
Okay.
- Now, where's the blank verse?
- Well Here you are.
There once was a girl named Sam - Hi, I'm back.
- We're both here this time.
How nice.
To thank you for your hospitality and also to give you a small token of our esteem.
- Well, thank you very much.
- Oh, yes.
But you shouldn't have.
It's an expensive vegetable dish.
You were so good to Abner.
I have a funny feeling it was you who put us back together again.
A very funny feeling.
Oh, it's beautiful.
- Thank you again.
- Ideal for Brussels sprouts.
I brought some champagne, but I see you've got some already.
Yes, we were planning on celebrating our reunion too.
- Maybe we shouldn't intrude.
- Intrude?
On these people?
You gotta be kidding, right?
- Right.
- We'll pool the champagne and make a night of it, right?
- Darrin?
- Right.
Here's to dreams.
- That come true.
- I'll drink to that.
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
Darrin?
Better hurry up and change, sweetheart.
We haven't got much time.
Changed, what for?
- We're having dinner at the club.
- Oh, I forgot completely.
- Would you rather not go?
- No, honey, I'll be fine.
Just let me Just let me rest here for a few minutes.
Darrin, maybe you'd like a cup of coffee.
Or perhaps you'd prefer a drink.
Darrin?
What a lovely-Iooking couple, except for him.
Does his mouth always gape open like that?
Only when he's sleeping.
Oh, Samantha.
I don't understand you at all.
I mean, if you had to marry a mortal at least you could've a chosen a better-Iooking specimen.
I like the way he looks.
Besides, I didn't marry Darrin just for his looks.
What else, his vivacious personality?
No one sparkles when they're asleep.
Anyway, I think he's quite handsome.
You're joking.
- He's got very good features.
- Name one.
Well, he has a nice firm jaw.
You like lantern jaws?
- He's got a nice mouth.
- "Slack" is a better word.
How about his eyes?
Beady.
But don't despair, dear, he could be fixed up.
- Fixed up?
- Yes, it's all very simple.
Now, take that dank, straight hair.
All it needs is Well, I'll show you.
I don't like that at all.
I haven't finished yet.
He needs coordinating.
Now if we just straightened out his nose - Mother, you've gone far enough.
- Oh, don't be stuffy, Samantha.
What would he look like with a moustache?
Oh, no.
That wouldn't be right at all.
Just a little one.
Wait, let me show you.
- How do you like it?
- On him, it looks good.
His hair's too curly.
- The coffee.
- What?
Now, don't you do anything till I get back.
Mother, will you answer that?
Yeah.
Is Mr. Stephens at ho?
That was Gladys Kravitz.
Sometimes I think that woman's a little strange.
Samantha!
- Darrin!
- Samantha!
It's all right.
There's no need to - My face, what happened to my face?
- Please stay calm.
- It was just a little experiment.
- An experiment?
It got a little out of hand.
There's nothing to worry about.
I want my old face back!
I want my old face back!
Well, of course you do.
Well, there you are, sweetheart.
Good as old.
Just a little play on words.
- Anything wrong?
- Wrong.
Well, it's all there, isn't it?
Samantha, why did you do that?
I suppose you do deserve an explanation.
- Well, it's rather difficult to explain.
- Try.
Well, you were asleep.
And Mother and I were looking at you.
Well, we got to talking about your looks and all.
Well - Well, you know.
- Go on.
Well, Mother got sort of carried away and gave you a long nose and curly hair and a moustache.
Well, we were just killing time.
Oh, sure, it beats jigsaw puzzles all to heck.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin.
Naturally, we were gonna change you back before you woke up.
- Darrin, are you mad at me?
- No, that's not the word.
- Furious?
- You're getting warmer.
- Darrin, please try not to be upset.
- I'm sorry, Sam.
I've sort of grown accustomed to my face.
I thought you had too.
- Darrin.
- Yes?
These are the layouts for the Harper campaign.
I'd like to get your reactions as soon as possible.
Sure.
Sure, Larry.
Oh, Darrin, I forgot to mention Something in my eye.
- Want me to take a look?
- No, no.
It's out.
- You were saying?
- Oh, yes.
Well, it has to do with the magazine copy.
Mr. Harper seems to Mr. Harper seems to have some doubts about using a lady wrestler to sell their products.
Darrin.
- Darrin?
- Oh, yes, go ahead, Larry.
Something bothering you?
- Larry, do you think I'm attractive?
- What?
I mean, how would you describe the way I look?
My physical appearance.
- Are you kidding?
- No.
How?
I've never really thought about it one way or another.
Never mind that.
Just give me your honest opinion of how you think I look.
Well, you're not the best-Iooking guy in the world.
You're not even the best-Iooking guy in the room.
But you're presentable, I guess.
I guess you're the wrong person to ask.
- I probably am, Darrin.
- After all, you're my friend.
You're bound to be biased.
I don't know, Dave.
She says she loves me.
Then why did she change my face?
Of course, it's the first year that's rough.
Rough, rough.
I'm a bachelor, but I know.
- The nose, maybe.
But the whole face?
- Two people, a 50-50 proposition give and take, share and share alike, it's the only way.
I mean, I fell asleep and she changed everything.
It's the little things that count.
Candies, flowers, a new dress maybe.
My mother always said my hair was my best feature.
Take my aunt and uncle, a mixed marriage.
He's good and she's rotten.
But they stay together.
Fifty years, but they've stuck it out.
They hate each other.
Now, that's love.
Sixteen hours a day I've been working, and that's the thanks I get.
You're more than welcome.
Hey, I got an appointment.
Well, glad I could help.
My mother-in-law did most of it.
But Sam assisted.
She even made suggestions.
Normally, I wouldn't have thought of it but I figured at least I should ask.
Go see this man.
Dr. McLeash, he's a plastic surgeon.
Psychiatrist.
Joe has your wife ever tried to change your face?
Twice.
Once with a rolling pin and once with a seven-iron.
Hello?
Oh, hello, Larry.
Acting funny?
- What do you mean?
- Well Sort of depressed.
Then today he began feeling his nose.
Feeling his nose?
- You mean?
- His secretary noticed it too.
- How do you know that?
- She came up to me and said: "Why does Mr. Stephens keep feeling his nose"?
Then he asked me if I thought he was attractive.
And you know the worst part of it, Sam?
He wasn't kidding.
Well, Larry, thank you for your concern.
I'll see what I can do.
Oh, dear.
- Something wrong with Derek's nose?
- Absolutely nothing.
But we've made him feel drab and ordinary.
Let's not take all the blame.
Mirrors must've had something to do with it.
Mother.
I wish I could make him believe you not only love someone despite their faults but sometimes because of them.
I love Darrin's nose.
Then tell him.
Don't you see, it's no good coming from me.
Well, you may run into trouble getting someone else to say it.
His ego needs building.
Someone, another woman has to tell him that he's the most attractive man in the world.
- Darling, don't look at me.
- I was thinking of me.
- You?
- Yes.
I'll simply change the packaging.
Do you think I am, how you say it, glamorous?
Oh, Samantha.
I'm proud of you.
Why, you even changed your voice.
But why the accent?
Darrin is partial to Brigitte Bardot.
There's just one thing though.
Don't you think your plan's a little dangerous?
Supposing what's-his-name likes you too much.
I trust him completely.
Well, you said yourself, he's only human.
Maybe you are right.
Well, nobody's perfect.
We'll see.
- Beer, please.
- What kind?
Any kind, they're all the same to me.
I just need something to quench my thirst.
Cheers.
- Did you see that ball game today?
- No, I didn't.
One of the greatest ball games I've ever Seen.
Real exciting.
Of course, for my money, the Yankees got the best in the whole world.
What's the matter with you, don't you like baseball?
- Yes, I do.
- Well, you just watch yourself, buster.
Baseball is America's national game.
And if you I don't feel so good.
Excuse me.
Pardon me, sir.
On one sip of beer?
Oh, I beg your pardon.
I'm sorry, I don't know how that happened.
Joe.
- Do not concern yourself.
- Could I get you something?
I'll have what you have.
Two, Joe.
Let me be honest.
- I am glad it happened.
- Glad?
I wanted to talk to you, but I did not know how to come in.
I am not long in this country.
And I did not know what is, how you say it, proper.
I see.
I live by impulse.
I see someone and I desire to talk to them, to know them.
- You understand?
- I guess so.
Well, that could cause problems sometimes.
Sometimes, but life is for living, no?
No.
I mean, yes.
I just look at you, and I know I like you.
- How can you tell?
- Faces with character attract me.
I would like to do your head.
- I beg your pardon?
- I am sculptress.
Your head, it excites me.
Put the drinks down, Joe.
I love your face.
It has strength individuality.
It is a face that has experienced Iove, sorrow life.
Yes?
I mean, yeah.
But mainly, it is a man's face.
It is a face that exudes how you say, sex appeal.
- That's how we say it.
- Put the drinks down, Joe.
I am very direct person.
I am sorry.
I have embarrassed you?
Oh, no.
No, not at all.
- But you see, miss - Michelle.
Michelle, you're new around here.
You probably don't know many people.
- You're probably Ionely.
- Oh, no.
No, I am not Ionely.
I meet many men.
But how you say it?
Nothing.
Yeah, it's very dull.
Who wants just another pretty head?
I see.
My studio is quite near.
We go and get to know one another, yes?
The face is important, yes.
But more important, behind the face.
I'm very flattered, but I'm afraid I can't.
- You have wife, no?
- Yes.
But she does not understand you.
Why do say that?
You drink alone at bar.
Well, she understands me most of the time.
There is no room in your life for two women?
Answer her, Darrin.
No.
Why are you smiling?
I envy your wife.
Boy, your wife must be something really special.
She is, Joe.
She is.
- Abner.
- What is it now, Gladys?
There's a strange lady driving the Stephens' car.
She drove it into the garage.
When she comes out, you'll see.
All right, I'll see.
There she is.
Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Now she's at it!
- At what?
- Changing herself.
Abner, believe me, there was a strange lady driving their car.
There's only one strange lady around here, Gladys.
By the smug look on your face, I take it the mission was successful.
Worked like a charm.
He wasn't even tempted by your offer?
Behaved beautifully.
He rejected me completely.
I wonder if I ought to act jealous when he tells me.
You think he'll tell you about his encounter?
Of course.
We have no secrets.
Darrin tells me everything.
Wanna bet?
What sort of a day did you have, dear?
Oh, average.
- This is very good.
- Thank you.
Anything unusual happen?
You did something special to the meat.
I asked you if anything unusual happened today.
No.
Come to think of it, something unusual did happen.
I stopped in a bar to have a drink.
Yes?
This guy sat down next to me, cold sober.
He took one sip of beer and he was stoned.
Darnedest thing.
- Anything else?
- No.
Then I came home.
May I have some more water, please?
Thank you, dear.
Ellen, could you come in?
I have some letters to dictate.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Stephens, I'm Barbara Lucas.
I'll be filling in for Ellen this afternoon.
She went home at lunch.
- Oh, is she sick?
- Oh, it's just a virus.
That's funny.
She seemed fine this morning.
- Those things can hit you just like that.
- It's too bad.
Well, you know what the French say, "C'est la vie".
Michelle.
Something the matter, Mr. Stephens?
Nothing I can't handle, Barbara.
It is Barbara, isn't it?
Yes.
You?
You ready?
I'm just waiting for you to get it off your chest.
- I beg your pardon?
- Go on, tell me.
Tell me how handsome I am.
How virile.
Build up my ego.
At least tell me how sexy I am.
- I don't think I understand.
- That's what you came here for, isn't it?
Mr. Stephens, I just came in to take dictation.
Sure, you did.
- Oh, hi, Sam.
- Hi, Larry.
- Darrin's better today.
- I'm pleased to hear it.
- Is he in conference?
- No.
He's breaking in a new secretary.
- Why don't you go in and see him.
- Thank you.
What to do you want?
This.
Darrin!
Sam!
I thought she was you.
I've heard of people like you.
You don't understand.
I thought you were my wife.
Boy, I've heard some excuses in my life, but that tops them all.
- Sam, I thought she was you.
- Is that your only excuse?
Isn't that enough?
You should understand.
- Darrin!
- Let me explain.
No need to explain.
One picture is worth 10,000 words.
- Sam, are you jealous?
- Well, what do you expect?
You really are jealous, aren't you?
How can you grin at a time like this?
I mean, you really are involved.
Involved?
I'm married to you.
Yes, but you love me!
It's marvellous!
Darrin, you don't care?
How you say it?
- You knew!
- Yes, I knew.
And I also thought you were Barbara.
Why didn't you tell me you knew I was Michelle?
Because I thought you were playing dirty pool.
- Now, suppose I'd risen to the bait.
- I knew you wouldn't.
You weren't so smug a few minutes ago.
Perfectly normal reaction for a wife who loves her husband.
Sam, you're playing a very dangerous game.
Now, just supposing that Barbara had responded to my advances.
Oh, darling, don't be silly.
- She wouldn't have done that.
- Why not?
Well, what would she want with a funny-Iooking guy like you?
{END OF EPISODE 33}{START OF EPISODE 34}
Hello?
Oh, hi, Shirley.
Yeah, well, of course I sound happy.
My husband just told me he loves me.
Oh, you won't be able to have the rally at your house tonight?
Well, of course we can have it here.
No, no, Darrin won't mind.
He likes me to do things like that, very civic-minded.
He just told me he was proud of me.
No, no.
No trouble at all.
Bye.
- What about the library?
- Find a seat, please.
Would you take a seat, please?
Pardon me.
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, I'm so glad you could come.
It is my privilege to introduce to you the man who will soon be the next councilman for Morning Glory Circle Mr. Ed Wright.
Thanks for a warm reception.
And to you, Mrs. Stephens for use of your home on short notice.
I appreciate your taking time out of your busy lives to come here so we could talk about my campaign.
We are all familiar with the record of John C. Cavanaugh.
I don't think it's necessary to warn you as citizens of this community as to the consequences of putting this man in office for another term.
We have been handled and manoeuvred to suit the purposes of the present administration, and I think it's about time we stopped - Hi.
- Hi.
- What is all this?
- Isn't it exciting?
- I was gonna call you.
- Call me about what?
What are all those people doing here?
- Darrin, you're gonna be proud of me.
- Are you sure?
You've wanted me to be active in the community and be interested in civic affairs.
- Yes, honey, but all those people There's a lot going on in this town that you don't know about.
There's a lot going on in this house I don't know about.
Shirley was having the Ed Wright for Councilman meeting at her place.
But then she couldn't, so I said we could have it here.
Darrin, he's wonderful, and you should hear him speak.
He's a Korean War veteran, a graduate lawyer, and he's very bright.
So really, I know he'll be wonderful for Morning Glory Circle.
That's why I knew you'd be proud of me.
Hold it, honey, hold it.
Why couldn't Shirley Foster have the meeting at her house?
Well, her husband works hard at the office all day and when he comes home, he doesn't like a lot of people around.
My opponent, John C. Cavanaugh has been dipping his fingers into city funds for too long.
Why is it that no outside company has ever managed to secure a bid for any civic project?
The roads, parks, schools, the auditorium, the library all built by firms owned totally, or in part, by John C. Cavanaugh.
The IJ Fentris Cement and Concrete Company they helped build our elementary school.
Its façade collapsed within two years, remember?
Cavanaugh talked about an investigation.
There never was one.
The Oster-Halth Pipe Company he gave them the contract to lay our leaking gas mains.
And the construction engineers who designed our deteriorating library.
And now, the costliest project of all: The Morning Glory Circle storm drain and water system.
Here, photocopies.
Photocopies of those contracts granted to the same incompetents by John C. Cavanaugh.
Now this is a sort of thing, we, you and I have to put a stop to once and for all.
Abner, isn't it wonderful?
Not bad.
The potato salad is a little salty.
You mean Cavanaugh has been getting away with murder for the past 10 or 12 years?
- As far as we can tell, yes.
I've pushed for an investigation since the start of the campaign.
That is the crummiest thing I ever heard.
It should be obvious to any schoolkid that the entire improvement program Well, it's a Cavanaugh monopoly.
Darrin, it's getting awfully late.
Mr. Wright must be dead tired.
Well, I am getting a bit weary, but having interested someone as enthusiastic as yourself, I can sit up all night.
Strange what goes on in the community without you knowing anything about it.
That's what I said.
That's where I heard it.
Darrin, this water project is the straw that could break Cavanaugh's back.
Make that the focal point of your campaign.
That's what I'm trying to do.
I've got an idea to run off posters at the office tomorrow.
That would be fine, Darrin, fine.
I'd really appreciate it.
- Well, good night, everybody.
- Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
Good night, sweetheart.
Maybe a sketch of Cavanaugh with his thumb in the dike dressed up like a little Dutch boy.
We'll figure out some kind of slogan to go along with it, maybe Politics doesn't make strange bedfellows.
Doesn't make any bedfellows at all.
Great, Darrin.
Just great.
These are for the straight campaign 24 sheets.
Has to be a certain amount of hard sell.
- It's traditional, people expect it.
- I suppose so.
Now, for the subtler taste we have these cartoon layouts.
I think they'll be very effective.
Now, that one I like.
Little Dutch boy, Cavanaugh, with his finger in the dike.
Now the caption reads, " Portrait of a hero with his fingers in everything".
I've told everyone about how much help you've been and intimated you were practically my campaign manager.
Well, if that's what you want, you've got it.
Okay.
Mr. Cavanaugh, the latest polls show a 16-percent change in Wright's favour.
- How significant do you feel that to be?
- Not very.
How much do you think the water project controversies had to do with Wright's popularity upswing?
Controversy?
He labels it the key issue of the campaign.
Well, I can't be held accountable for Mr. Wright's labels.
What about the governor's investigation, sir?
- What about it?
- Will there be one?
I doubt seriously that the governor will be coerced into wasting his time and the state's money by the irresponsible accusations of a politically ambitious youngster.
We can be proud of the finest, most modern, most efficient water and storm drain system in the country.
Be assured it will serve the citizens of this community long after Mr. Wright and John C. Cavanaugh are gone and forgotten.
That was Councilman John C. Cavanaugh.
And this is Charles Turner from the steps of City Hall.
Now we return you to the station and more Pretty sure of yourself, aren't you, Mr. Cavanaugh?
Well, you just better watch your step, because: We are the bright girls Rally round for Wright, girls That isn't funny, Mother.
On the contrary, it's hysterical.
What was that incantation you were gyrating through?
That isn't an incantation, it's a cheer.
- What does it do?
- It doesn't do anything.
- Then why were you doing it?
- Because you see, Mother, in - Never mind, you wouldn't understand.
- Oh, dear, Samantha.
Every time I see you, you seem to be getting more and more confused.
I'm going to a political rally tonight.
What's so confusing about that?
Politics?
You, in politics?
Well, you needn't laugh.
Politics is a very serious business.
Only to politicians, my dear child.
My husband happens to be very proud of me.
- For what?
- For taking a position.
I don't know what you're talking about.
And neither do you.
You know, it surprises me sometimes how unaware you can be for having lived as long as you have.
Don't be vulgar, Samantha.
Well, it's true.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go get ready.
I suppose all this was Darwin's idea.
Mother, Darwin's idea was that man was descended from apes.
- This was my idea.
- Descended from the ape?
Man?
It's called the theory of evolution.
Pity to disillusion him.
Other way around, actually.
And it is no longer a secret, my friends and fellow citizens that John C. Cavanaugh and his whole corrupt machine are on their way out.
I know it and you know it, and what's more, John C. Cavanaugh knows it.
The people will be fooled for just so long, then they demand a reckoning.
Too many important issues have been pushed aside unanswered.
Too many real and challenging problems have gone unheeded and unsolved.
Too many private interests have been served and too many public interests have gone unsatisfied.
I say to John C. Cavanaugh: "We want answers and we want them now".
Stand up with me before the people, before all the people and give me the answers I want to ask in your behalf.
Any time between now and Election Day I have offered to meet Mr. Cavanaugh in a television debate to discuss every issue, in the open, no punches pulled.
And I mean every issue including the Morning Glory Circle water and storm drain project.
Whoever delivered Mr. Cavanaugh's message you can tell him it'll take more than an omelet to keep me off his back.
Abner, did you ever hear such a wonderful speechmaker?
Abner, did you ever?
Abner.
Abner.
I can't hear a thing, Gladys.
I'm wearing earmuffs.
You ready to go home?
My hands are freezing.
I have just been handed the late edition of the Gazette.
The governor has ordered a complete investigation of the water main and storm drain project.
What do you say to that, Cavanaugh?
Ten seconds to airtime, and Cavanaugh hasn't shown up yet.
- You don't think he will, do you?
- I doubt it, Ed's as good as elected.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
For the past two weeks, Councilman Cavanaugh has ignored my invitation to appear with me on tonight's program.
A debate under these circumstances would seem impossible.
But, present or not one day Mr. Cavanaugh will be forced to answer these questions.
One now that an investigation is already underway what excuse can he offer for an administration corrupt with nepotism, graft and private interests?
If we can take those allegations one at a time, Mr. Wright perhaps I can deal with them to your satisfaction.
Now, shall we go from the beginning, Mr. Wright?
You have accused me of nepotism, graft, corruption and How did you put it?
- Double talk.
I've also been accused of blocking investigations and obstructing justice.
Perhaps we can clarify what seems to be the main issue in this campaign.
We would all appreciate that, Mr. Cavanaugh.
Fine, now let me not waste any more of our viewers' time.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to present Mr. Merrill Sedgwick who, ironically, is here tonight at my opponent's instigation.
Mr. Sedgwick is from the state capitol a member of the governor's investigatory staff.
Mr. Sedgwick, Mr. Wright.
Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Sedgwick.
We are honoured to welcome a distinguished member of the governor's committee to Morning Glory Circle.
I've spent the past two weeks quietly investigating Morning Glory Circle's new water system from stem to stern and I have nothing but praise for its planning, construction and materials.
Moreover, I'm astonished at the conservative low cost.
This fine water system should last for many, many years.
It has my unqualified endorsement.
Thank you.
My appreciation, Mr. Wright, for this opportunity afforded me to set the record straight.
Good night, my fellow citizens.
If I've said it once, I've said it a thousand times: Women should not get mixed up in politics.
- You never said it to me.
- Don't split hairs, Sam.
You could've found out if Wright knew what he was talking about before dragging me into this mess.
- I didn't drag you in, Darrin.
Did I not come home weeks ago and find my living room full of women screaming: "We are the bright girls Rally round for Wright, girls"?
I was only trying to be part of the community.
You said you were proud when I took an interest in civic affairs.
So I was wrong.
I'm not so perfect that I can't be wrong once in a while.
The truth of the matter is, Cavanaugh trapped everybody into making Go ahead and say it.
"Making fools of themselves".
Wait'll they find out about this downtown.
I could be finished in the advertising business.
I don't see why.
What if Cavanaugh sues us for slander, what then?
He wouldn't do that.
Why wouldn't he?
We called him a thief, didn't we?
On television!
And a state investigator proved he was right and Wright was wrong.
Wright is not wrong, Cavanaugh is just shrewd.
You bet he's shrewd.
He let us hinge our entire campaign on that water project knowing it would stand up under investigation.
Everything else he's done has been dishonest.
If only they'd investigate some of those things.
But they didn't, and they have Sorry, darling.
Mother, meet me downtown immediately.
- Is that you, Mother?
- Of course, dear.
Have I ever let you down?
We really shouldn't be here, but I had to find out about Cavanaugh.
Still in politics, Samantha?
Oh, really.
- Mother, this is very serious.
- Serious for whom?
- Darrin.
- Oh, he's so naive.
Doesn't he understand that this latest project of Cavanaugh's is the only legitimate thing the man has done in his life?
We have no proof of that.
Well, just looking at the man is proof enough.
We have to have the facts, Mother.
What would you like to know?
The deal on the IJ Fentris Cement Company.
- There, dear.
- Thank you.
Well?
He's a crook, all right.
Would you get the file on the gas main?
It was handled by the Oster-Halth Pipe Company.
- O or P?
- O. There you are.
Well?
You were right, Mother.
According to these records Darrin and Mr. Wright pounced on Mr. Cavanaugh at the only time he was honest in his whole life.
- Oh, that husband of yours is a lulu.
- Mother.
Well, anyway, you know it's funny, isn't it?
- Shall we go?
- I think we better.
And thanks for your help, Mother.
- Ven't, and they're not going to.
Oh, there's a simple way to handle this, but Donald wouldn't approve.
On the other hand what he doesn't know won't hurt him.
Good evening.
I'm Abner Kravitz, civil defence block warden.
- Evening, Mr. Kravitz.
- Evening, Mrs. Stephens.
You don't have to evacuate your house yet but if I were you, I would keep my radio on KXIW and keep some warm clothes and a rubber life raft near the front door.
- Rubber life raft?
- Yeah, don't you have one?
No, what do we need a rubber life raft for?
A large water main burst at the corner of Elm and Forest.
Flooded most of the neighbourhood.
They say it's under control, but I like to be prepared for the worst.
- Water main?
- Yeah, the whole storm drain collapsed.
Excuse me, I've got a few more houses to go to.
Good night, Mr. Stephens.
Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
Good night, Mr. Kravitz.
Flood, isn't that amazing?
The length that some people will go to just to win an argument.
- What do you mean?
- How'd you do it?
Just what are you inferring?
Are you gonna stand there and tell me you're not responsible for twitching up this flood?
- Yes, I am.
Well, that drain didn't burst by itself.
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mother.
You'll have to excuse us, we're having a fight.
- What about?
- It doesn't concern you, Endora.
Oh, I'm not so sure about that.
- Have you heard about the flood?
- Oh, now, Mother - You mean it was you?
- I'd certainly like to know who else.
Well, what did you do that for?
You've been raving at my daughter.
And everyone else has been perfectly miserable because a water main hasn't burst.
So I just thought I'd burst one.
What good is that going to do?
Well, it should prove that Mr. Sedgwick was wrong.
And they'll probably reopen the investigation and examine all of Mr. Cavanaugh's past dealings.
That is utter nonsense.
Hello?
Yes, Ed.
Are you serious?
Yes.
Goodbye, Ed.
- What'd he say?
- Sedgwick called Ed and said that he was wrong and they'll probably reopen the investigation and examine all of Mr. Cavanaugh's past dealings.
- Isn't that what I said?
- Yes, Mother.
- Isn't that what he wanted?
- Yes, Mother.
Well, what's he's so unhappy about?
You wouldn't understand, Mother.
I don't know, it's just that I don't know, it's just all pretty mysterious.
I suppose I should stop fighting it.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Good afternoon, councilman.
Come in, and congratulations.
- Samantha, how are you?
- Ed, congratulations again.
- Thank you.
- I'd like you to meet my mother.
Mother, this is our new councilman, Ed Wright.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, yes.
I saw you on television, young man.
It was most effective.
You're very kind, Mrs Mrs?
Waters.
You're very kind, Mrs. Waters.
It's the greatest thing I've seen since the Lincoln-Douglas debates.
Hey, your mother has a great sense of humour.
- Yes, hasn't she.
- What's the latest on Cavanaugh?
We're going along with the investigations as planned but Cavanaugh's disappeared.
- Really?
The general consensus is he's skipped the country.
- Oh, that's too bad.
- We'd like to prosecute him but we have to find him first.
I think he'll probably turn up sooner or later.
- Do you really think so, Mother?
- Oh, I'm sure of it.
I'd give anything to have him right here in the palm of my hand.
I'll drink to that.
You have accused me of graft, corruption and nepotism.
My appreciation, Mr. Wright, for affording me this opportunity of setting the record straight.
Right, my fellow citizens?
{END OF EPISODE 34}{START OF EPISODE 35}
Samantha, what did you say the name of this establishment is?
- Mario's.
- Mario's.
I'm amazed.
This is the best Italian food I've had this century.
It is good.
Just taste this veal Marsala.
Only on the condition that you taste the fettuccine.
It's a deal.
Mother.
Delicious.
Superb.
Ladies, excuse me.
I'd like to know, everything satisfactory?
- It certainly is.
- Pay our compliments to the chef.
- Thank you.
- You're the chef?
Well, I am Mario's chef, Mario's waiter, Mario's cashier, Mario's everything.
To make a long story short, I'm Mario.
Why, you should have hired help.
Signora, you see, business is so terrible, I'm the only one I can afford.
You mean with such superb food at such reasonable prices?
I will put it in one word: Pizza.
- Pizza?
- Si, pizza.
You see, excuse me, in the confusion of this Atomic Age people who are not Italian and they want to order Italian food, you know they don't order veal scaloppine, fettuccine alla bolognese.
No.
- They want pizza.
- But it isn't even on your menu.
And it's not going to be.
No.
You see, I belong to a family of men who've been artists in the kitchen for five generations.
And I modestly belong to this glorious tradition.
So I refuse.
I refuse to slap it in the face with pizza.
This makes sense, no?
- Absolutely.
- But it makes no difference.
Because my restaurant is going to fail.
My wife and children are going to starve and today's dessert is zabaglione.
I don't ordinarily feel sorry for human beings, but I do feel sorry for him.
So do I. I think I'll ask Darrin to help.
How?
Washing dishes?
Mario's isn't a success because the public doesn't know about it.
Advertising is Darrin's business.
Informing the public is Darrin's stock-in-trade.
Hardly.
His stock-in-trade is contributing to the delinquency of my daughter.
- Mother?
- What?
You're a tough woman.
You're a great witch, but you're a tough woman.
Hi, honey.
- Welcome home, my hero.
- Your hero is pooped.
- Routine overwork or special crisis?
- Both.
We have a new client for whom we're planning a major saturation campaign, and he - No.
- No what?
No, I won't bring my problems home.
I will leave them at the office like the mature executive I wish I were.
- Now, how did your day go?
- Just wonderfully.
Mother and I went to a marvellous Italian restaurant called Mario's This guy's a real tiger.
- Who?
- Linton Baldwin, he's the new account.
He goes through advertising agencies like women go through new dresses.
I'm sorry, a restaurant called what?
Mario's.
The food is superb.
Mother had veal Marsala, and I had In the past three weeks, he's changed agencies twice.
Darrin, you're not exactly leaving your problems at the office.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
It's on my mind, I just can't shake it.
Don't fight it.
You tell me about Mr. Baldwin, and I'll tell you about Mario's.
Okay.
Linton Baldwin is the shining light of the pizza industry.
- No kidding.
- No kidding.
He owns a large chain of pizza parlours and is expanding to the East Coast.
He wants McMann & Tate to get him off the ground with flying tomato paste.
Darrin, you have no idea what a coincidence this is.
Mario was saying that pizza is putting him out of business.
- Why?
- Well In this Atomic Age, when non-Italians Honey, take a look at this newspaper ad.
It runs in tomorrow morning's paper.
Tell me what you think.
- Perfect Pizza?
- That's the name of the product.
Darrin, would you consider a pizza parlour a restaurant?
I guess so.
Well, sure, why?
Obviously you believe a good way to inform the public a restaurant exists is by taking out an ad in the newspaper, right?
Right.
Sweetheart, I'm going to drown my sorrows in a hot shower.
Thank you for being so sympathetic and patient.
Any time.
Now, let me see "For the finest in Italian cuisine, eat at Mario's".
"Treat your taste buds to lunch or dinner at Mario's".
No, keep it simple.
"Eat at Mario's".
That's it.
"Eat at Mario's".
Good morning, sweetheart.
Now, let's see how my ad looks in print.
Here we are.
One quarter page of advertising genius.
Gorgeous.
Now, eat your breakfast.
Not bad.
Not bad at all.
A full-page ad.
A full-page ad for an individual restaurant.
- Whoever took that out must be nuts.
- Why do you say that?
Do you know how much a full-page ad costs?
- No, how much?
- It costs Yes, dear?
Sam, isn't Mario's the place you ate yesterday?
Yes.
Sam, you didn't by any chance?
Sam?
You didn't put an extra page in the newspaper, did you?
Sam?
Well Sam, you promised never to do that again.
He's such a nice man.
I only wanted to help.
When is this going to end?
I was only trying to inform the public that Mario's exists.
And in case you were wondering, a full-page ad my way doesn't cost a nickel.
- I wasn't wondering.
- Darrin, are you upset?
- Of course I'm upset.
- Because my ad's bigger than your ad?
- Guess again.
Because you think that taking out an ad by witchcraft is cheating.
That's closer.
I think taking out an ad by witchcraft is criminal.
Criminal?
But why?
I didn't replace a page, I only added one.
Whom did I hurt?
Whom did you hurt, she asks.
You hurt the publisher who offers advertising space to make money.
You also hurt the other advertisers who resent paying for something somebody else gets free.
You also hurt the United States of America a democracy whose economic system is called capitalism.
Well, those are good points.
I should've thought of them.
Well, why didn't you?
Well, I was so anxious to help Mario get some customers.
His food really is wonderful.
He deserves to be a success.
I promise I won't do anything like that again.
Good.
Am I forgiven?
I guess so.
I like your motives.
But I don't like you drumming up business for one of Perfect Pizza's competitors.
Mario doesn't serve pizza.
I'm glad to hear that.
Maybe your husband's client won't be jealous.
Good.
I hope.
How come Perfect Pizza gets a quarter page and Mario's restaurant of which I've never even heard of, gets a full page?
Mr. Baldwin, taking out a full page for a single restaurant is poor advertising.
We don't put all our eggs in one basket.
We diversify.
I'm not selling eggs, I'm selling - We appreciate that, but nevertheless - Okay, forget it.
I just wanna make it clear I don't enjoy playing second fiddle.
With me, selling pizza is more than a way of being a multimillionaire it's a public service.
- A public service?
As a small boy in Modesto, California, I had a dream.
A dream of American families, men, women and children sitting together, eating pizza.
Nobody's sulking about not getting the kind they like because they chose from 21 varieties.
Just having a hot, nutritional meal and being together.
That's an interesting dream.
I guarantee you that if every American family went out for pizza only twice a week the national crime and unemployment rates disappear.
Am I right or am I right?
- Well - The irony is that I can't seem to find an advertising agency who can put that message across.
Mr. Baldwin, it's almost time for your show.
- What show?
- Phase two of our saturation campaign.
You're the new sponsor of a local TV game show.
Well, now you're talking.
I'll just warm up the set.
- Good morning, dear.
- Good morning, Mother.
I just saw your advertisement for Mario.
You did?
I must tell you, I wasn't very impressed.
Why not?
It's too mundane.
" Eat at Mario's, Why, it wasn't even on the front page.
Now, you should be more creative.
I thought it was rather good.
- Where you going?
- To turn on the television set.
At 10:30 in the morning?
Oh, Samantha, you're becoming the typical suburban housewife.
Thank you.
Darrin asked me to watch one of his commercials.
Good morning, game lovers.
It's time to play Your Guess is as Good as Mine brought to you by Perfect Pizza.
- That's Darrin's account.
- It is?
There's a Perfect Pizza Parlour near you.
Eat it there or tak e it home.
The quality of the 21 varieties of Perfect Pizza is perfect.
Cute.
However, if you hate pizza, as many people do try the utterly divine veal Marsala at Mario's, 126 Adams Street.
Let's introduce our first guest Mrs. Ira W. Jones.
- Mother, why did you do that?
To help Mario.
And to show you what I meant by being creative.
I demand to know what a plug for Mario's restaurant is doing on a program sponsored by Perfect Pizza.
Mr. Baldwin, I have no idea.
- It must be some kind of payola.
- No calls.
- We'll conduct an investigation.
- You do that.
- While I conduct a series of lawsuits.
- Lawsuits?
I'm gonna sue that TV station, I'm gonna sue that wise-guy announcer and I'm gonna sue McMann & Tate.
You gotta give us a chance You had your chance, and you flubbed it up.
I'm cancelling my account, effective immediately.
As of now.
- You know who I'm signing with?
- No, who?
The advertising agency who handles Mario's restaurant.
Mr. Baldwin, wait!
Let's not be hasty.
Alice, get me my wife.
She is?
Put her on.
Why did you do it?
You promised me - Darrin, I didn't do it, Mother did it.
- Tattletale.
Don't be silly.
What good would it do to kill her?
I'd come right back and haunt him.
Will you please be quiet.
He's cancelling his account?
He wants to sign with who?
But there isn't any.
Darrin, how can he sign?
Darrin?
- He hung up on me.
- There, you see?
He's no true gentlemen.
- Mother?
- Yes, dear?
Congratulations.
You have just won a new client.
And I have just lost an old husband.
Oh, poor baby.
Oh, don't worry.
Mother will make everything all right.
- How?
- We'll make Mr. Pizza change his mind.
His name is Baldwin.
I have no idea what he looks like or where to find him.
Want to bet he's at Mario's?
In search of revenge?
In search of the name of Mario's advertising agency.
- Would you like to drop over and look?
- Let's.
I'll go upstairs and change.
We haven't time.
We'll change on the way.
- All right.
Ready?
- After you.
That's my gal.
Mister, please, I have no time to chitchat.
I have 36 reservations for lunch.
In other words, your advertising campaign is really paying off.
How many times I have to tell you?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on, Mario, be a sport.
All I want is the name of your advertising agency.
I am a one-man operation.
You mean you placed the ad and the commercial yourself?
- I don't place nothing.
- Well, then how did they get there?
I plead the Fifth Amendment.
Look, Mario, I don't blame you for not wanting to share a live-wire organisation when there are so many deadbeats like McMann & Tate.
So I'll make you a proposition.
You give me their name, and I'll amalgamate you into my chain.
What chain?
"Linton H. Baldwin.
Chairman of the board, Perfect Pizza Parlour".
Yeah.
Why did you do that?
Why?
Because I don't want to be "legamated" - mixed up with this pizza business, not even for $1 million.
- Why not?
- Why not?
Because it's an insult to humanity.
Now, see here, buddy, see here.
As a small boy in Modesto, California Now that I discover you're in the pizza, I order to you to leave the premises.
- Who applauded?
- I don't know.
Maybe somebody up there likes me.
Are you implying that pizza is atheistic?
I am implying once more for you to leave my premises.
If it wasn't beneath my dignity, I'd sue you for public obscenity.
Well, we found him.
Now, what do we do to get him back with McMann & Tate?
Well, we'll do the same thing we did for Mario: We'll advertise.
We'll take turns.
You're on.
- Me?
- Yes.
Very nice.
Your turn.
Let's see, sandwich signs, billboards I think I'll try skywriting.
Baldwin said he would.
He did.
He did what?
Signed with the agency that handles Mario's restaurant.
Come look.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess he did.
- Well, what will it be, little girl?
- I want a Perfect Pizza.
Sorry, no pizza, just plain old ice cream.
If I can't have a Perfect Pizza, I don't want anything.
- What will it be, sonny?
- I want a Perfect Pizza.
No pizza, only ice cream.
If I can't have a Perfect Pizza, I don't want anything.
Shades of Modesto, California.
I want Perfect Pizza too.
Pardon me, ladies.
Did you hear that dog say, "I want Perfect Pizza too"?
Yes, we did.
A talking dog.
It must be some publicity stunt.
Probably arranged by that live-wire advertising agency McMann & Tate.
- You know McMann & Tate?
- Doesn't everyone?
They're the best in the business.
Whoever owns Perfect Pizza is lucky to be their client.
- Shall we go, dear?
- Yes, Mother.
Let's drop into our nearest Perfect Pizza Parlour and lay in a six-month supply for our family freezer.
Darrin, you know why I never like to lose an account?
- I think so.
The lower profits?
- No.
Because I can't stand to feel rejected.
- I learned that in my analysis.
- I didn't know you were analysed.
Seven years.
When the doctor told me not to come back because I was cured I felt rejected.
Yes?
Yes, Mr. Tate's here, who's calling?
Just a second.
Linton H. Baldwin.
- Tate speaking.
- On second thought I decided not to switch agencies in midstream and to stay with you.
- He wants us back.
May I ask what prompted you to change your mind?
The sandwich signs.
A billboard.
The skywriting I saw.
Two kids in the park and a talking dog?
Mr. Baldwin, I have You'll sign a one-year contract.
Hold on.
Mr. Stephens, have we replaced the Perfect Pizza account or can we still handle it?
- I'll take a look, Mr. Tate.
- No, I think we can handle it.
- Oh, good.
Mr. Baldwin, you're in luck.
It's a deal.
You're welcome.
We're not rejected.
- How about a balloon for the kiddies?
- No, thanks.
If I can't have Perfect Pizza, I don't want anything.
Perfect Pizza?
Hi.
I was just passing by, so I thought I'd drop in and say hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hello.
Darrin, what do you know about that skywriting and the sandwich signs and a billboard and two kids in the park and a talking dog?
They're all part of Darrin's campaign for Perfect Pizza.
They are?
Didn't you tell him?
I was saving it for a surprise.
I didn't want to get your hopes up in case it didn't work out.
Well done.
My, you certainly are a creative executive.
- I hope you appreciate him.
- I do, I do.
You son of a gun.
You son of a gun.
Veal scaloppine.
For the children, we have spaghetti.
Whatever you want.
What would you like?
Mr. And Mrs. Allen?
Come with me, please.
I'm flattered to be included in your celebration, Daniel.
Darrin.
I'm delighted to include you.
Sam tells me it was all your idea.
Maybe it will be the start of a beautiful friendship.
Maybe it will.
I'm grateful.
Although in the future I would appreciate you letting me handle my campaigns myself.
- Do you think you can?
- Of course he can.
Except in special circumstances, he needs no help from anyone.
- Table for three?
- Please.
- Your name, please?
- Stephens.
- Do you have a reservation?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.
Well, I'm sorry.
Without a reservation, there'll be a 40-minute wait.
My two customers from before I am successful.
I remember.
How you like?
Luigi, sit down the ladies and the gentleman.
But they have no reservation.
I always reserve a table for old friends.
This way, please.
This way.
My, my.
Another special circumstance.
Just relax, sweetheart.
{END OF EPISODE 35}{START OF EPISODE 36}
- Darrin.
- I woke up.
- You all right?
- I heard a sound and I woke up.
You sneezed.
That's ridiculous.
I never sneeze in my sleep.
It wakes me up.
What time is it?
- A little after 3.
- Did you set it for 7?
Yes, it's all set.
Now you better cover up and go back to sleep.
I gotta have a clear head tomorrow.
I gotta.
I've got some day.
Can I get you anything?
Well, my stars, cousin Edgar.
You got it?
Don't you think it's about time you began to materialise?
I can't spend the entire morning talking to a cup.
Are you still bashful?
Come on now.
Don't be silly.
All the way.
Well, now that's better.
It certainly is nice seeing you again, cousin Edgar.
I can't wait for you to meet my husband, Darrin.
Right now, he's taking a shower.
I hope you won't be hurt if I don't introduce you today.
You see, he has a very important meeting and he's very nervous.
And he's an absolute bear when he hasn't slept well.
You understand?
If there's one thing that might give him a bit of a jar right now, it's an elf.
We'll have to sneak you up on him gradually.
Why don't you ease in for dinner tonight.
I want him to like you just as much as I do.
After all, you're the best bodyguard a young witch ever had.
Any time I was in trouble, there you were, my trusty little elf.
Come to think of it I don't remember seeing you unless I was in trouble.
So, what brings you here now?
Edgar?
Edgar?
Oh, well.
See you tonight.
I don't believe it.
- Hi, sweet - Hi there.
- What happened?
- I cut myself.
- Badly?
- I'm afraid to move my head.
Oh, you better call the plumber, have him look at the bathroom pipes.
They on the fritz again?
Boy, you make a hot cup of coffee.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
I don't know.
I've been like this ever since I got up.
I guess I'm nervous.
- The Shelley shoe account?
- Yeah, big meeting this afternoon and I haven't got an idea in my body.
I better change these.
You'll think of something.
You always do.
I'd better.
Boston, Barton, Schulwiler and Froug are hovering like vultures.
- They want this account very badly.
- Well, don't let them get it.
- Larry will never forgive you.
- Worse than that, he'll probably cry.
Oh, I'm late.
I better leave.
I better change these first.
Wild slogans and puns.
That's all you've got.
"The sole of the shoe industry".
"Shelley likes to play footsie with you".
"We want you well heeled".
No wonder you couldn't sleep last night.
All right, Larry.
All right, I admit it.
You've got me.
Maybe I was reaching just a little bit.
But there's still some They've got it for sure.
The account is as good as in Froug's pocket.
Snap out of it, Larry.
It won't help to go in with that attitude.
You don't know this guy Shelley.
He's a wealthy square.
He wears tailor-made stuffed shirts.
Any idea that's far-fetched or the least bit eccentric I know will go right out the window.
We've got to come up with some Did I say something funny?
No.
No, I just had the oddest sensation.
You were saying, Larry?
Well, one thing.
You're a pretty normal, presentable person.
You talk well, you dress well, you behave well.
I think that's in our favour.
- You all right?
- Yeah.
I'm not just accident-prone.
It's got to be more than that.
Endora!
If we can only come up with an exciting, brilliant, square idea I think we've got it licked.
Did you call me Endora?
Why should I call you Endora?
Listen, Larry, this may be the answer to all our problems.
Just a simple, eye-catching sketch.
Something like this.
You start out with this.
It goes Why?
Why are you doing this to me?
- Why am I doing this to you?
- I didn't mean that.
Oh, well, perhaps you'd like me to apologise.
Larry, it's just charcoal.
It'll come right off.
Here, here.
Get up.
I can't seem to move my foot.
Try taking it out of my pocket.
I hope that's not a good suit.
Not anymore.
Hello?
Your mother's destroying me.
What have I done to deserve it?
Mother?
My mother?
That's the one.
I don't need help to lose the Shelley account.
I can do very well on my own.
I don't understand, Darrin.
What's she doing?
She's making me look like a clumsy, bumbling idiot.
No, I'm not overtired.
You speak to her.
And be firm.
All right.
- You all right?
- Sure.
- Mother.
- Yes.
I want a word with you.
Have you been bothering Darrin?
- Who?
- My husband.
Oh, that who.
Don't play innocent.
I want an explanation.
For what, dear?
He says he's beginning to look like a clumsy, bumbling idiot.
I know what he looks like.
I just can't remember his name.
Did you or did you not go to Darrin's office for some reason?
I'll be very honest.
I wouldn't go to his office for any reason.
I'm trying so hard not to upset him what with cousin Edgar coming and all.
Edgar?
Cousin Edgar here?
What's wrong?
Don't be naive, Samantha.
Edgar must regard your marriage as a blot on the family name.
I just regard it as a blow against good sense.
- You don't think that he would?
- Of course.
Isn't it divine, dear?
It's terrible.
I'll have to do something to stop him.
Oh, I don't think you can.
A witch who's on the wagon is no match for an elf who's on the warpath.
If that won't put him to sleep, nothing will.
Oh, I feel like a traitor, Samantha.
I just can't bear to stay and watch.
- Thank you for your help, Mother.
- Call me Benedict Arnold.
Edgar.
I'll get Jim DeWitt to make the presentation.
Nobody can make a presentation like me.
Take the day off.
Catch up on your sleep.
I don't feel like sleeping.
Darrin, I can't risk it with you.
Larry, you can't risk it without me.
I remembered how much you like hot chocolate so I made some for both of us.
Here, sit down.
Oh, my.
I see so little of Darrin, it's nice to have company.
Oh, I remembered your favourite cookies too.
There you are.
Drink up, cousin Edgar.
You all right?
Of course I'm all right.
Would you stop asking that?
You're right.
If I had any sense, I wouldn't wanna know.
I wonder what keeps me in this business.
How come Froug's in on this meeting?
That's the way Shelley wants it, both agencies represented.
Isn't that a bit unethical?
Yes.
But Shelley has one redeeming feature.
He contributes huge sums of money to the advertising industry.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Mr. Froug is here.
- Larry boy, how's the boy?
- Freddy Froug.
Darrin, sweetheart, nice to see you.
Are you still married?
Or are you happy?
How are you, Fred?
I'll tell you the honest truth.
I can't complain, kid.
Everything is top of the mast.
How is it with you and your shop?
Pretty smooth.
You know.
Well, that's a nice change.
- I'm only kidding.
You know that.
- Sure.
Well, today's the big day, huh?
Today we put wings on our airplanes and see how they fly.
Listen, Larry.
And I mean this in all sincerity.
May the best man win, kid.
You know what I mean?
I mean, I mean that in all sincerity.
We'll run it up the flagpole and see who salutes.
I wish you both luck.
Thank you, Fred.
Whatever you wish for me, I wish for you.
Well, slugger.
Aren't you gonna shake my hand?
Oh, sure.
- Darrin!
Easy does it.
- Up you go.
- You all right?
- Where did you learn to fall like that?
It's started.
It's started.
Why, hello, Mr. Shelley.
I don't believe you've met.
Mr. Shelley, this is my top creative man, Mr. Stephens.
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
Sit right here.
May I assist you?
Okay.
Thank you, young man.
- Are you all right?
- All right, Endora, I know you're here.
You're not gonna get away with this!
You won't get away with this.
Come out wherever you are.
I say, come out wherever you are!
All right, Endora, I know you're here.
Sam?
Sam?
Sam, where are you?
Honey, wake up.
I have something very serious to talk to you about.
Hi.
I hope your mother's proud of herself.
I hope she's good and satisfied.
- Sam.
- Yes, dear?
I've had quite a day.
Have you been sleeping all afternoon?
That's a fine attitude.
Just when I need you most, you couldn't care less.
You might be interested in knowing that the Shelley account just about went up in smoke.
Am I boring you?
Oh, no, of course not.
But you are cranky.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
I just finished telling you what's the matter.
We had to postpone the Shelley meeting until tomorrow.
Fortunately, he didn't like Froug's ideas either.
I've got one more chance.
Oh, well, that's good, darling.
I'm sure you'll think of something.
Sam, what is the matter with you?
I don't know what's the matter with me.
But I'm all right now.
I don't understand.
Sam, what do you mean it's not Endora?
- Now, darling, try to be calm.
- And who is cousin Edgar?
- He's an elf.
- You're kidding.
No.
I'm afraid I'm very serious.
I've been a favourite of his for years and Well, I think he resents you.
- Why, for Pete's sake?
- He's protecting me.
From what?
He doesn't think I should be married to a mortal.
He doesn't understand how I can be happy.
- Are you happy?
- Of course.
Well, then tell him.
Also tell him if I have one more mysterious accident I'll punch him right in - Has he got a nose?
- Yes.
Nose.
Edgar, you stop it this instant.
Where is he?
Where is he?
I'll destroy him.
Where is he?
Cousin Edgar?
- Cousin Edgar!
- Edgar.
Ed Edgar, you're behaving like a child.
Edgar, I'm not gonna stand for any more of your merry pranks.
You hear me?
Now, look, sweetheart.
By some miracle, in a little while I'm gonna have to convince Shelley we're the only agency that understands him.
I love you.
And if your cousin Edgar doesn't understand that I may have to ask you to do something horrible to him like turn him into a human being.
Now, think about that for a while.
But, Darrin, your suit's stained.
It's all right.
It's a brown suit.
Edgar, could I see you for a moment?
Your face.
Edgar, pull yourself together.
Now, about that hot chocolate.
Now, I know you think you're doing this for my own good, but you're not.
I love Darrin.
No use being upset about it, because that's the way I feel.
And for the first time in my life, I feel wonderful.
Now, that's how it is.
What makes Darrin happy makes me happy.
Now, if you were really concerned about my happiness you'd know I'm worried about that Shelley shoe account because it's important to Darrin.
Edgar, I know you're all broken up about it, but Edgar?
Edgar, where are you going?
Cousin Edgar?
Today, things are gonna be different.
I've got some ideas that are gonna knock him right - Right out of his chair?
Larry, if you let Jim DeWitt do this, you're committing suicide.
Darrin I wanna tell you something.
Darrin, I've been in this business a lot longer than you.
I know what the pressures are, what they can do to a man.
I may retire shortly myself.
I'm not firing you.
I just want you to take a few days' rest.
You'll come back a new man.
But I don't wanna come back a new man.
I like me as I am.
Why do you wanna do this?
It's like being thrown from a horse.
If you don't leap right back in the saddle, you may never ride again.
Okay.
- Thanks, Larry, you'll never regret it.
- Darrin, I know I'll never regret it.
I think.
Dynamite, I tell you.
I had Fitzgibbins draw them up.
When you make him race his engine, he's the best artist on the staff.
Best artist in the whole darn world.
Present company excluded, of course.
Larry did you hear the door open?
No.
- Are you?
- No, no.
Forget it.
Forget it.
It's none of my business, Darrin, but have you been hitting the booze at all?
- Just a little bracer.
- Unnerved to face Shelley?
No, to face you.
Gentlemen, Mr. Shelley's here.
Oh, good afternoon, sir.
It's a pleasure to Is this gonna be another one of those days?
Come on, get up.
This is no time to play around.
- This is business.
- I don't understand.
- Now, if we can get on with this.
- Certainly, Mr. Shelley.
Darrin.
May I help you?
I don't know which one of you wants to go first.
I have some interesting sketches here, sir.
I'm sure you may remember I am definitely going to retire.
I know it's none of my business, but have you been hitting the booze at all?
I'd like to know what's going on around here.
Dynamite.
I'm sure you'll agree, sir.
Wait till you see these sketches.
Now then, sir, here's a beauty.
Now, if you like that one, sir, wait till you see this one.
Is this your idea of a joke?
Oh, no.
No, no.
It was Fitzbiggins No, no, I mean it was my l Sir, do you mind if I leave you for a minute?
To be honest with you, I'm gonna be very much annoyed if you stay.
And I thought he was such a bright young man.
Darrin.
Hey, this is very clever.
The elves of a shoemaker, is that right?
- Oh, yeah.
- I don't remember any This will have great appeal for the kids.
I like that.
Yes, I like that very much.
What?
I can't get over the look on Shelley's face when he saw those sketches.
Oh, Darrin, I'm glad it all worked out.
Where's cousin Edgar now?
- I think he's gone.
- Oh, yeah?
- Well, that's what you wanted, isn't it?
- Oh, yeah.
He at least could have said goodbye.
I'm glad to know you're not angry with him anymore.
Angry?
For destroying my sleep and making me look like a lunatic for two days, why should I be angry?
To tell the truth, I'm not angry.
I was getting kind of used to having the little guy around the house.
Sam.
Sam.
I knew you'd like each other if he snuck up on you gradually.
You know, I'm genuinely sorry to see him leave.
You mean you'd rather not be alone with me?
I didn't mean that at all.
