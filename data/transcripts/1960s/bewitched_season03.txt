{START OF EPISODE 01}
Now we're gonna take one little bite.
There you go.
- Isn't that good?
- Crunch.
Crunch, crunch.
Yes, it's delicious.
Don't forget.
Call me from the doctor's the minute he finishes.
She's only having a check-up and we know she's in perfect health.
The diaper rash.
Be sure to ask about the diaper rash.
I've been losing sleep over that rash.
- Tabatha hasn't.
- And over-drooling.
As I see it, she's been over-drooling.
I'm surprised at you.
And tell him that Phil Hooverback's little girl is potty-trained at 11 months.
That's precocious training.
Darling, you're so nervous, you'll need a check-up more than Tabatha.
Look at her.
Isn't she fine?
Isn't she beautiful?
She is beautiful.
And so are you.
Oh, thank you.
I still want you to call me the minute the doctor finishes his check-up.
Yes, sir.
- "Bye, Daddy".
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
Good girl.
Mr. Stephens, please.
Hi, Darrin, it's me.
I promised I'd call as soon as Dr. Koblin finished Tabatha's exam.
Well, he says she's Oh, wait, wait, wait.
I've got my list right here somewhere mixed up in this miserable Robbins campaign.
Okay.
Now, what did he say about her?
Just a minute, sweetheart.
Dr. Koblin?
As one baby expert to another, please, do you mind?
Oh, why, certainly.
- Here we go.
- Darrin.
I'm happy to say your daughter's perfect in every department.
- About this diaper rash - Yes.
Wonderful.
Yes, I checked that thoroughly.
- Excellent.
- I have a feeling she's over-drooling.
Oh, I checked that thoroughly.
And the potty-training?
A friend of ours, her little girl was potty-trained in 11 months.
Is that?
Excellent.
Couldn't be better.
That was my diagnosis exactly.
I'm so happy to have your confirmation, Dr. Stephens.
That's right.
Darrin, she's a perfectly marvellous sensational, absolutely wonderful typical average baby.
Goodbye.
Now, Tabatha, I want you to do that test and I certainly hope you flunk it.
I think.
Now you can't get that pretty pony, can you, Tabatha?
- Can you get the pretty pony?
- Come.
She can't get the pretty pony.
- Pretty pony.
- She can get the pretty pony.
Oh, just wait until your father finds out.
Oh, what could be worse?
My mother finding out.
That could be worse.
Finding out what, dear?
Oh, Mother, what a lovely surprise.
Oh, but right at Tabatha's naptime.
What a rotten shame.
Let's let her get to sleep.
Oh, but if she's going to sleep, she needs her bottle.
What is going on here?
Oh, nothing, Mother.
Nothing at all.
Now, I didn't use my power to float that bottle to Tabatha and I know you promised Darwin to restrain yourself.
Now, that leaves only Tabatha.
Tabatha.
Is that what's going on here?
How utterly, utterly divine.
Put the bottle down, dear, and come to Grandmamma.
Oh, you little dear.
Welcome to the fold.
- Mother - What?
- Mother - What?
- Maybe it's just a fluke.
- Fluke?
In our family?
Oh, don't be absurd.
- Well - Darwin.
That's what it is.
He doesn't know?
You haven't told him yet?
Oh, how delicious.
Darling, let Mother tell him for you.
It would be quite fitting.
No, Mother, no.
Absolutely not.
I want to prepare Darrin to get him used to the idea.
And when he is used to the idea, then I want to tell him myself.
Now, I mean it.
Until I do tell Darrin otherwise Tabatha is just a typical average baby just like the doctor said.
That's what the doctor said.
"Your baby is perfect in every department.
Wonderful, marvellous, sensational".
I could say more, but I don't like to brag.
Really?
It's not noticeable.
But let me tell you what another man said.
Our client Mr. Robbins.
He said this campaign is no good.
No good?
I've been working night and day for three solid weeks on this account.
I haven't been home, seen my wife or daughter I know.
That's why I want you to take the afternoon off.
- Take the afternoon off?
- Sure.
Go home, see your wife and daughter.
Rest, relax.
Get a new lease on life.
In one afternoon?
Yeah, on account of Robbins is coming to town tonight and I'm bringing him to your place for cocktails so you can get a better feel of the kind of image his firm wants.
I see.
You want me to take the afternoon off to rest and relax get to know my wife and daughter, get a new lease on life so I can slave night and day for another three weeks or more, right?
Right.
All right.
If you wanna make a physical wreck out of a perfect-in-every-department baby's father well, that's okay with me.
- Mother?
- Yes, dear?
Larry's bringing a client for cocktails.
I've got to go get some hors d'oeuvres.
Well, Tabatha and I will be just fine alone, dear.
You won't be alone for long, Mother.
Darrin's going to be home early.
And if he gets here before I get back, remember now remember, not one word about Tabatha being a - You know.
- The word's "witch," dear.
Behave yourself.
Tabatha, my dear we're finally alone.
Let's have some fun, huh?
Now watch Grandmamma.
Now, peek-a-boo.
Peek-a-boo.
Tabatha?
Tabatha do you think you could do that fun trick for Grandmamma?
Go on.
Try, dear.
- Funny.
- Go on.
Try harder.
Very well.
Come to think of it your own mama couldn't disappear past her knees until she was 5.
Well, let's see now.
Let's see now.
That's it.
Let's see if Grandmamma's darling has developed basic topsy-turvy.
Shall we?
Look.
Watch the lamp.
See it?
There.
Now flip it back.
There.
Hex it for Grandmamma.
Now hex it for Grandmamma.
Well, I guess the lamp is too heavy for your little hand.
Now, Tabatha Pretty, pretty.
Let's try this little dish, huh?
Now watch the little dish.
There it goes.
Yes.
Honey, I'm home.
Hi, Endora.
When did you swoop in?
Is that any way to greet your daughter's grandmamma?
Oh, sorry.
Hi, Granny.
- And how is Daddy's little girl?
- Out.
Out.
Did you hear she passed her check-up with flying colours?
- She's quite a little girl, all right.
- Where's Samantha?
She went to get hors d'oeuvres or something foolish for your client.
Yes.
He and Larry are coming over this evening.
She'd never have to do such menial things if her husband weren't a mortal.
Why, she could arrange a cocktail party just like that.
How dare you.
How dare I what?
What?
What?
How dare you what, what, what?
How dare you How dare you perform feats of M-A-G-l-C in front of my daughter.
I guess I lost my H-E-A-D.
Endora, this is a serious matter.
These are Tabatha's formative years and I don't want her normal little psyche scarred with M-A-G-l-C.
And another thing.
When you're left to mind Tabatha don't put so many toys in her playpen.
Why, she loves a lot of toys.
I know what's best for my daughter.
- Now cut that out.
- I didn't do it.
Then explain how such a thing could happen.
Oh, you're getting much too clever.
I can't fool you at all anymore, can I, Dumbo?
- Darrin.
- Oh, yes.
Whatever you say.
Excuse Daddy for losing his temper, sweetheart but I'm the one guy in the world who can say without malice his mother-in-law is a W-l-T-C-H.
Oh, he can spell it out till the cows come home but we both know what we are, don't we, Tabatha?
Get the pony.
That's a girl.
That's a girl.
That's Grandmamma's little girl.
Purity, Darrin.
I am looking for purity and something soft and something absolutely innocent.
Well, purity and innocence are fine, but how will they sell transmissions?
I don't know.
All I know is the Robbins firm wants to change its image.
We'll let our competitors shove transmissions down the buyers' throats.
We don't find that palatable.
Mark, I'm sure Darrin can come up with a campaign you want.
- Sam, how's Tabatha?
- Oh, she's fine.
I'd let you take a peek at her, but she's asleep.
She's wide awake.
I was just up there.
You wanna see her?
- Well, sure, that sounds fine.
- Now, Darrin Larry saw the baby three days ago, and I know Mr. Robbins isn't interested.
That was before the doctor said she was perfect, absolutely perfect.
Darrin, he didn't mean that literally.
No baby's absolutely perfect.
Argue with the doctor.
He's the one who said it.
Let's go and put her through her tricks.
Tricks?
But - Come on, honey.
- Well, all right.
Look at that face.
I've been told she looks like me.
Oh, maybe not through the ears, but there's a strong resemblance.
Look at that face.
Don't you see?
That's our new image.
Softness, purity, absolute innocence.
I know what you mean and don't forget beauty.
- Yes.
Yes, indeed.
- Right.
These are areas that have never been associated with truck transmissions.
It's a very original idea.
Just picture Tabatha's face plastered on billboards all over the country with a caption reading: "A Robbins transmission makes you feel almost shiftless".
I think we can iron out that slogan, Mark.
I'll arrange an appointment for Tabatha with the agency photographer - But I don't think - No, no.
We don't want just any agency photographer.
There's just one man who can do justice to that face.
But I really don't think - Diego Fenman?
- Who else?
- Can you get him?
- Certainly.
Only about the greatest baby photographer in the world.
Sam, imagine Tabatha being photographed by Diego Fenman.
How about that?
- Well, I'm afraid we can't do that.
- Why?
Well, you know what they say happens to babies who go into modelling or show business.
They get their picture all over everything they start believing their own press and bounce from marriage to marriage.
Sam, at her age she won't even know what she's doing.
With a face like Tabatha, we've got a winning campaign.
You really think she's cute, don't you?
Like he said, she's a doll.
Maybe she's got one of those faces that photograph fat or something.
- Sam, I'd like to go through with this.
- Lf you ask me Fine.
I'll call Diego Fenman and set up an appointment for Tabatha early Saturday morning.
- Great.
Honey, I'll bet we are the only father-and-daughter advertising team in the country.
- That calls for a drink.
- Absolutely.
Come on, Mark.
There, sweetheart.
Now you go to sleep.
I'll take your pony.
Oh, Mark?
Good night, sweetheart.
Sleep tight.
Tomorrow's the big day.
- Tomorrow?
- Big day.
- Coming, sweetheart?
- In a minute.
Now, Tabatha, you have to be good tomorrow because I can't stop them from using you in the campaign.
Not when it means so much to your daddy.
And I can't tell your daddy about you because then he'd be afraid to let them use you in the campaign.
No.
Now that's what I mean.
You're gonna have to be good.
Funny.
I know.
I know what a wonderful feeling it is to be part of a magical life to have so much at your fingertips.
But we're living in a world that just isn't quite used to people like us and I'm afraid they never will be.
So I'm gonna have to be very firm with you.
You're going to have to learn when you can use your witchcraft and when you can't.
Now, your wonderful daddy wants us to be just plain people.
So you're gonna have to stop wiggling your fingers whenever you want any Tabatha.
You twitched your nose.
Just like Mommy.
Oh, you are your mother's daughter, all right.
Oh, how charming.
When every other mother in the world is telling her child, "Mustn't touch" you'll be saying, "Mustn't twitch".
- Mother, cut that out.
- Oh, we must tell Darwin.
Let's go in and watch him fall on the floor in an emotional heap.
No, Mother.
I will tell him myself and it's gonna be hard enough without your gloating little zingers.
Goodbye, Mother.
You sure know how to take the fun out of things.
I must have learned it from you.
Well, Tabatha, wish me luck.
This will be the hardest speech ever delivered in the history of a marriage.
Pretty pony.
Let me see.
Darrin, Tabatha is a witch.
No.
No, that's too abrupt.
Let's see.
How about: Darrin, I have something to tell you that I don't think will exactly be a thrill.
No.
That's too chicken.
Maybe I can write him a note.
No.
I'll tell him first thing in the morning.
So you see, Darrin, it's really nothing.
All it amounts to is that Tabatha is a witch.
Darrin?
Darrin?
"Dear, Sam Tabatha and I have gone to the photographer's studio.
Wanted to let you sleep.
Don't worry, everything will be fine.
Love, Darrin".
Disaster time.
The photographer's studio.
All right, gentlemen, I'm in the mood now.
- So are we.
- Hi.
Darrin, Larry, Mr. Robbins.
Oh, boy, am I glad I got here.
Tabatha's just about to go in front of the camera.
Well, I'll go with her.
She'll need her mommy.
Diego Fenman works alone.
Samantha, this is Diego Fenman the master photographer.
The Michelangelo of the portrait world.
- An artist in the truest sense.
- A Rembrandt if ever there - I'm glad to meet you, Mr. Fenman.
- Thank you.
- Wouldn't you like me to go with you?
- Oh, no.
An audience tends to freeze my creative flow.
Mustn't freeze his flow.
- Darrin, do something.
- About what?
Sam, I assure you that Diego Fenman is an expert at handling children.
Oh, but Tabatha's different.
Mrs. Stephens, you'll be very pleased with the results.
Diego works magic with a camera.
Yes, but so does Works magic with a camera, huh?
That's nice.
See that nice bearsy there?
All right, now, Tabatha you make cutesy for Uncle Diego.
Watch the pretty pony.
Uncle Diego ought to lay off the funny water when he's gotta work the next day.
Watch the pony.
I knew I had problems, but wait till my analyst hears about this.
- How long are they gonna be in there?
- Honey, relax.
Diego's very thorough, Mrs. Stephens.
Why, the man's very nearly a genius.
He just wants to get a perfect pose for the campaign.
I'm sure Tabatha's fine.
All right, now.
Make cutesy.
Cutesy for Uncle Diego.
There we go.
Uncle Diego's gone flipsy again.
The whole brain is falling right out of the back of the head.
- I've gotta peek.
- Well, honey, go ahead.
Anxious mothers.
I can stand it no longer.
Tabatha, come on.
- What happened?
- You wouldn't believe it.
My analyst will not believe it, but I believe it.
I've seen it.
I mean, I saw it with my own eyes.
Diego, did you get any pictures?
I got all kinds of pictures.
I got floating-stuffed-octopus pictures and bouncy-rubber-ball pictures and She did it.
She's the one who did it to me.
Oh, take her away.
Put her away.
That is one nutty baby.
Wait a minute.
You're blaming this silly display of emotion on my daughter?
A helpless 1 -year-old?
You should be ashamed.
I ought to be ashamed?
She ought to be ashamed.
You talk to her.
You do something with her.
I've tried everything.
My charm, my exuberant personality.
I even used my pretty picture of a pretty pony.
That pretty picture has amused every single child I have ever worked with except her.
Oh, I tell you, she did this to me.
Funny.
Come on, Sam.
I don't have patience with a person who abuses babies.
Or with babies who abuse photographers.
Now, mustn't twitch.
Please.
Honey.
Wow, Mr. Fenman sure took a lot of pictures.
I didn't think he had time.
You should've heard Larry and Mark.
They really flipped over the results.
This is the one we're going to use to launch the ad campaign.
Oh, Darrin, isn't that cute?
Say what you want about Diego Fenman he still is pretty close to being a genius.
- What do you mean?
- Well, look at this.
This is the most amazing trick photography I've ever seen.
Do you see any wires?
No.
No, I can't say that I do.
Anybody would think that toy octopus was actually suspended in midair.
Certainly would.
Now aren't you glad you let him take the pictures?
- You were just worrying for nothing.
- Yes, darling.
You have a beautiful wonderful daughter and I hope she grows up to be just like you.
Something tells me you're gonna get your wish.
You stop that.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Hey.
Pay attention.
Here, you want a little bite?
Want some?
Well, let me stir it for you.
Wait a minute.
Come on.
Here, you want some cereal?
It's good.
- You want a taste?
- Taste.
Okay.
There you go.
No.
No, sweetheart.
Mommy doesn't want you to do that, remember?
- Mustn't twitch.
- Hi.
At least not until I've had a chance to tell Daddy that you're a Well, I mean, that you have the power to That you can do witchcraft.
Hi.
And I'm going to tell him tonight, while we're celebrating our anniversary and he's in a good mood, at the right time, when the lights are low and we're in a restaurant where he can't scream and there's a nearby exit.
Oh, no.
Oh, Tabatha, please.
Sweetheart, baby, angel?
Listen, Tab, stop fooling around.
What was she doing?
Honey, you're not trying to get her to use a fork, are you?
I know she's smart, but don't you think you're pushing her too fast?
Well, no, darling.
As a matter of fact, I'm trying to slow her down.
Well, I know she's as smart and as pretty and as devastating as her mother.
- Happy anniversary.
- Happy anniversary.
Oh, darling.
Now, Darrin, I love you.
I love you very, very much.
And nothing, absolutely nothing, can change my love.
Well, swell, honey, but what brought that on?
Well, it's just that I think things like that ought to be said every so often.
Like now, and later on tonight.
Okay.
- Samantha.
- Coming, Aunt Clara.
- Hello.
- Aunt Cl?
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara.
By parachute?
Yes, I thought this time I'd drop in quietly.
Well, let's go up to the guest room.
Oh, I'm so pleased to sit with Tabatha while you and Darrin are celebrating.
We're pleased to have you.
I've gotta dash out do some shopping and meet Darrin, but I'll be back before she wakes up.
And if she does wake up, I'll tell her you were here.
Here we are, here we are.
Now, isn't that nice?
Nice crackers.
Eat your cracker, dear.
Eat Oh, no more play.
Well, now the crackers.
Now, eat, eat, eat.
What a sweetie.
Oh, Clara, you're not what you used to be.
Oh, Aunt Clara.
Not only have you lost your old pizzazz but you've thrown everything out of gear.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara, what's the matter?
Oh, everything.
My magic.
Whenever I wave at a chair all the pots and pans, they start flying all over the place.
Oh, you poor dear.
Aunt Clara?
Has Tabatha been giving you any trouble?
Tabatha?
Oh, no.
You sure about that?
No, I'm positive.
No, it's me.
Perhaps you haven't noticed but lately, I've made a lot of mistakes.
- You have?
- Yes, I have.
Now, don't tell Darrin.
Oh, no, I wouldn't think of it.
Because when you can't seem to zero in on anything and your coordination is just about shot well, you might as well face it.
Face what?
Face having a checkup.
I'm sure that's all you need.
You're just overtired, that's all.
A little rest and you'll be as good as new.
Yes, but you've been counting on me for your anniversary, and Oh, no.
No, no, Aunt Clara.
You're my favourite aunt and your health means more to me than anything.
So come on, get up.
Up, up.
Come on, come on.
Now, you just go home and take good care of yourself.
- Well, I will.
- Oh, good.
Now, just assist me on the takeoff, will you?
Oh, yes, of course.
Go on, go on.
Oh, dear.
Go on, bag.
Go on, brolly.
Back to Aunt Clara.
Good.
Is everything all right?
Well, Aunt Clara wasn't feeling too well, so I sent her home.
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- I don't think so, but just to be safe.
Well, so much for our anniversary celebration.
I guess it is a little late to get a sitter.
- I could call Mother, she'd love to.
- Never mind.
- Why don't we have the Tates over?
- Good idea.
Larry loves to celebrate things.
Yeah, he celebrates any day of the week with a Y in it.
And a little bubbly for Louise.
Here we go.
Here's to the Stephens.
- I'll buy that.
- Hold it.
The happiest couple on the face of the good old earth.
Larry, what about us?
The happiest couple on the face of the good old earth.
A bright guy, a lovely wife, a beautiful baby and a kind and understanding boss.
Why shouldn't they be happy?
Cheers.
- Cheers.
- Cheers.
Cheers.
- Nice champagne, huh?
- Marvellous.
Wonderful, Larry.
Great.
Larry, what are you doing?
Oh, I'm terribly sorry, Sam.
I thought there was an ashtray there.
Oh, well, that's all right, Larry.
We were gonna throw that table out anyhow.
- That's nice.
- I'll give you another - I don't know what happened.
- I'm sorry.
It's okay.
It could happen to anybody.
- Don't worry about it, Larry.
- I'm really terribly sorry, Sam.
- Care for some more, Sam?
- Oh, thank you, Larry.
- This is marvellous caviar, Samantha.
- Louise, here we go.
Darrin, pass me your glass.
Squeeze it, Larry.
Squeeze it.
Well, one down, two to go.
Time to bring up the reserves.
- I'll get another bottle.
- I brought it and I'll get it.
Larry, what happened?
Well, the cork blew out and knocked the pot off and the pot knocked the empty bottle over, and - Well, it could happen to anyone.
- Sure, that makes a lot of sense.
Okay, you want another explanation?
I'm clumsy.
- Sold.
- Don't worry.
Nothing was broken.
You take the champagne into the living room.
- I'll drive.
- Officer, I only had a couple of beers.
Larry's in a great mood tonight.
Sam?
- How did that happen?
- Well Could somebody be trying to spoil our anniversary, like your mother?
Oh, no.
Oh, no, darling.
I don't think so.
If Mother wanted to spoil the party, it would be raining in the living room.
Then what else could it be?
Well, Aunt Clara's spells haven't been working too well lately.
She's rather worried about them.
You mean, some of them might have a delayed reaction, like a time bomb?
Could be.
Great.
I hope nothing happens in front of the Tates.
- Me too.
- Come on, kiddies.
Get it while it's bubbly.
Come on.
Everything will be all right.
- Come on.
- All right.
So on that tough 15th hole I chipped right onto the green and into the cup, and you know what I said?
- Yes.
You said - Please, Louise.
I said, " It's a birdie, it's plain, I'm Superman".
Maybe you don't get it.
You see, it's funny because I said Oh, we got it, Larry.
It just isn't worth repeating.
- Excuse me.
- Darrin.
Well, I'm glad we didn't go out this evening and I hereby invite both of you over to our 50th anniversary.
Thanks, Darrin.
That's very nice, but you'll have to clear it with Louise.
I have a feeling that we have something else on that night.
But let's drink to it anyway.
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.
What's the matter with them?
Now, Tabatha, you simply have to learn to control yourself.
You see, sweetheart, your daddy would Not Endora.
Not Aunt Clara?
- Hi.
- Who else then?
It's not?
Not?
What's her name?
She's just a baby.
It's not possible.
Darrin, you always knew it was possible.
Oh, yeah, I've always known it was possible I just didn't think it was possible.
I mean, a whole year and not a sign.
After a year you get a feeling of a false sense of security, I mean, you feel that you're home free.
- Daddy.
- You think it's awful.
No, I don't think it's awful.
It's not awful.
It's just sort of Well, it's surprising, astounding.
Shocking, is what it is.
That's what it is.
It's shocking.
- And you think it's awful.
- Quit saying that.
Well, Darrin, I don't blame you.
I knew you'd feel this way.
I told myself.
I was prepared.
- Oh, honey, wait a minute.
- Oh, Darrin, I'm sorry.
I mean, I know how you feel about witchcraft and, well, I was just waiting for the right time to tell you about Tabatha but I guess she decided to tell you for herself.
My daughter's a witch.
Sam, I've got to know.
How much of a witch is she?
- Well - Hi.
She doesn't really know what she's doing.
It's all sort of involuntary.
She wants something, and she gets it.
She doesn't realize it's a special power.
What are we gonna do?
Well, we'll just do what any parents of a child with a special ability or a talent would do.
We'll just teach her how to use that talent wisely.
- How do we do that?
- Oh, well, Darrin, don't worry.
Any baby that can be potty-trained can be witchcraft-trained.
Funny Daddy.
Hey, up there.
Remember us?
- Tate's the name.
- We'll be right down.
Sam, we gotta get them out of here before Before they see something and start asking questions.
We sure do.
Now, Tabatha, you lie down and go to sleep.
And be good.
Otherwise, we may be in for some difficult moments, huh?
Problems?
Oh, no, nothing unusual for a baby of her age.
Anything I can do to help?
No, Louise.
She just doesn't want to sleep.
Oh, let me try.
I have my own way.
I'll sing to her.
- Oh, no, no!
- Why not?
It works like a charm.
With her voice, the kids fall asleep in self-defence.
It might stimulate her too much and she'd be up all night.
Right.
So let's all sit down, relax, and make an evening of it.
Not for me, Larry.
But it's your anniversary, boy.
I know, but we have that conference tomorrow.
Hey, the conference.
That's right.
We gotta get up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
The day after tomorrow, because that's when the conference is.
I thought it was tomorrow.
That's what I like about this boy, he's eager.
Now, drink up.
That's an order.
Finish your drink, Larry.
I think we better be going.
- Must you?
- Well, if you really have to No, we don't have to and we're not going to, so sit down, everybody.
That Tabatha's developed into quite a musician, hasn't she?
Our Jonathan went through that phase.
Don't you remember?
- Can't you do something?
- Yes, but it will have to be - At this stage of the game, anything.
- First, Tabatha.
- Hey, she stopped.
- So she did.
Well, now that she's through making noise, why don't we make some?
Happy Thursday!
Don't say it, Louise.
Don't say it.
I will too.
You're acting like a child, you've had enough champagne.
I am not acting like a child.
- I'll get a towel.
- I will too.
No, now, Larry, you just sit right back.
Don't worry.
Everything's going to be fine.
I assure you I am in full possession of all my faculties.
What are you going to do?
With a little help from me and Louise Larry's gonna be convinced he's had enough and it's time for beddy-bye.
Lovely.
Please, Larry, take it easy.
Louise, my love, you can't possibly think I've had too much champagne.
Samantha, Louise thinks I'm getting splashed.
Do you think I am?
Well You're kidding.
On four glasses of this stuff?
- You've had six, but who's counting?
- I have?
Well, even six glasses, big deal.
Oh, well, don't worry, Larry.
We love to see you enjoying yourself.
You really think I'm getting smashed.
Darrin, back me up.
Larry, it's okay.
Like Samantha says, we like to see you enjoying yourself.
Okay.
I demand a sobriety test.
Larry, that won't be necessary.
Just try saying "chrysanthemum".
That's easy.
Chrystanthenum.
Chryscrustenum.
Chrysmanth Oh, daffodil.
I can't even say it when I'm sober.
Doesn't prove a thing.
- Now, give me something else.
- Well, if you insist.
How about the equilibrium test?
You close your eyes and try to touch your nose with your fingers, like this: All right.
Watch me.
Taxi!
Now, wait a minute.
That's just a family weakness.
Yes, I know, dear.
If I buy you a blanket, will you promise not to suck your thumb?
Oh, now, Louise, don't worry.
We love Larry.
We don't mind.
I demand another test.
All right, Larry.
What would you like to do for us?
Pick a straight line, anywhere, and I'll walk it for you.
Walk from the champagne you spilled to where you burned the table.
Thank you, Darrin.
You're a wonderful host.
All right, I'll pick my own line.
Right over here.
I'll walk from here to the bar.
Okay.
Larry.
Larry.
- Is that you, Louise?
- Yes, bubbie.
Are Darrin and Sam still here?
Would you say good night to them for me?
Yes, my babe.
Come on.
- Up we go.
Good night, everyone.
- There you go, Larry.
And happy anniversary.
- Thank you, Louise.
- Come on.
That's it.
- Good night, Larry.
Good night, Louise.
- Larry, Louise.
Good night.
A couple more minutes of that and Larry would have taken the pledge.
- Maybe I was a little hard on him.
- Don't worry about Larry.
By tomorrow, he'll be telling the story and he'll be the hero.
A 1 -year-old baby turning the house upside down.
Now, if Aunt Clara would have done that, l - What?
- Aunt Clara.
I've got to tell her before she convinces herself she's seriously ill.
You do that on your own.
I think I'm gonna lie down.
Aunt Clara, I have to see you right here: That was a smooth landing.
- Thank you, dear.
- You're welcome.
Aunt Clara there's something I have to tell you.
All those things that were happening No, no, now, dear.
The pots and the pans and Well, Aunt Clara, it wasn't you.
No, it wasn't you, it wasn't you.
It was Tabatha.
- No.
- Yes.
- No, not really.
- Yes, really.
Sure, really.
What isn't "really" in this house?
Well.
Well, the little imp.
Oh, dear.
I'm feeling wonderful.
For you, dear, your anniversary.
And congratulations.
Oh, thank you, Aunt Clara.
Our family's first little witch of her generation.
Isn't it marvellous?
Everybody in the family will be popping in to see her.
Oh, I must spread the news.
"Everybody in the fam" Sam.
Well, darling, I wouldn't worry.
I'm sure she just means the immediate family.
That's a lot of consolation.
Just what's the matter with my family?
How much time do you have?
Never mind.
Oh, my.
Now, Tabatha, I know it's been a big day but now it's time for sleep, and I mean it.
Darling, she'll be sort of experimenting with her powers, trying them out.
She sure seems just like any other baby.
Well, she is, except for - You tell her.
- Okay.
Tabatha, mustn't: Mustn't: Good.
Good.
That ought to do it.
You really think so?
Well, of course.
I mean, you told her.
Well, that didn't always work with her mother.
Oh, well Oh, Darrin, do you mind awfully?
- I've been giving that a lot of thought.
- And?
It's been wonderful living with one beautiful witch.
It will be twice as wonderful living with two.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Mother, it's the middle of the night.
That's the proper time for us, you know.
Well, what is it?
I thought you should know that tomorrow has been chosen as the day of the witches' coven.
Coven?
Why?
Who?
Your aunts, the entire group.
They're flying in from all over the world.
Clara has been collecting old doorknobs in Bolivia.
And Enchantra has been coaching a yogi in Outer Mongolia.
And Hagatha is coming from her school.
- What's the occasion?
- We've all been designated a coven to examine and report on Tabatha.
Report?
What kind of report?
Ordinarily I don't get myself involved in committee work.
I've done more than my share, as you well know.
But Tabatha is my grandchild and I want to be here when her powers are measured.
Good.
I'd like to know myself.
Darrin will object.
Oh, boy, will he object.
That's why I came to tell you tonight.
- Get rid of him!
- What?
Not permanently, just for tomorrow.
Although permanently is a more attractive idea.
Well, fortunately, that won't be necessary.
Even though tomorrow's Saturday, Darrin has to work.
- So we're in the clear.
- Splendid.
I don't have to measure your powers, Tabatha.
I know you're the most adorable little witch in the world.
Bye-bye, honey.
Think you're gonna have to work late?
Isn't having to work Saturday bad enough?
Somebody ought to tell Larry about the 40-hour week, eight-hour day.
- Talk about your slave drivers.
- Oh, darling, Larry's not that bad.
He's not, huh?
Greetings.
Would you mind knocking before you pop in?
Well, I thought you were on your way to work.
I am.
And somehow you showing up makes it all seem worthwhile.
- I'll call you later.
- Please do.
Especially before you come home.
Why?
Well, so I can have a martini in the window.
What else?
That's a good idea.
Don't feel you have to wait for me, Endora.
Never fear.
Oh, that mortal.
Oh, I do hope Tabatha's powers are not limited to her unfortunate lineage.
That unfortunate lineage happens to be Tabatha's father and my husband.
- I'll thank you to remember that.
- I know, I know.
But I love her anyhow.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Aunt Clara, are you all right?
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes.
I'm I'm all right.
Oh, dear.
Oh, yes.
You know, Samantha l'm afraid that you're going to have to put a bigger chimney in.
You You know?
You might try coming through the door, Clara.
And lose my professional standing?
Oh, there's the little darling.
What a dear little girl.
Oh, it's so long since we've tested a child.
Aren't you excited, dear?
Oh, yes, I certainly am, Aunt Clara.
I hope the others aren't too late.
I'd like to get on with it.
Mother, do you think Daddy'll be here?
I have no idea where Maurice is and I have no intention of hunting him down.
- Well, it would be nice if he were here.
- Why?
It's your father.
Because Tabatha is also my grandchild.
Oh, Daddy!
How's Daddy's little girl, eh?
May I remind you that she is also Mama's little girl?
I wish you'd stop making these unannounced theatrical entrances, Maurice.
It's really quite unnerving.
I'd always hoped somehow that age would mellow you, Endora.
Instead, you're just puckering up.
Now, now, Mother, Daddy, don't.
Clara, it's been a long time.
Maurice, you're looking very well.
Oh, there she is.
There's Maurice's little precious.
Do that again, and I'll make you talk baby talk for the rest of your unnatural life.
You wouldn't dare.
Well, she's quite a little girl, isn't she?
Yes, and she's certainly got it.
There's no question of that.
I'm glad you're pleased, Daddy.
You know, there's a lot of me in this little darling.
A certain nobility, a certain fire, a How about sickening charm?
Someday, Endora.
Someday.
Daddy, are you gonna stay for a while?
Aunt Hagatha and Aunt Enchantra are coming here.
A coven, eh?
Well, the child must certainly be certified.
There's no doubt about that, Samantha.
Tests must be made.
- You'll stay for them?
- I'm sorry.
I was on my way to the opera in Vienna when I heard about Tabatha.
They're doing Faust tonight.
I always get a million laughs out of that.
Besides, you don't need me.
This is women's work.
Clara, you're looking more ravishing than ever.
Oh, thank you very much, Maurice.
I must leave before this gaggle of geese gets here.
Let me know what their findings are.
How will I be able to get in touch with you?
Right.
This This will always get through to me.
Thank you, father.
Well, curtain time.
Keep smiling, Endora.
I'll never know what I saw in that man.
I know.
What in the world is keeping them?
I'm due in Tel Aviv this afternoon.
Oh, really?
What's in Tel Aviv?
What's in Tel Aviv?
The surf's up, my dear.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I hear them coming.
Aunt Hagatha, Aunt Enchantra, how lovely to see you both.
Thank you, dear.
Nice to be here.
Oh, you came together.
How very sisterly.
Hagatha picked me up on the way.
You're both late.
Let's get on with it.
Thank you, Macbeth.
We won't be needing you for a while.
- Where is the little darling?
- She's in the kitchen eating cookies.
Oh, she shouldn't have anything to eat before the tests.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot, Aunt Hagatha.
Well, I'll just have to make allowances for it.
Be careful.
She's just a baby.
Well, we haven't lost a patient yet, dear 308 years certifying witches.
I hope the husband isn't home.
No, the poor dear's working.
Oh, well, good.
Humans emit a low-grade frequency which upsets my instruments.
Put this on the child, Clara.
Yes.
Oh, it's a pity that Darrin had to work today.
Some of your ideas are mighty provocative, Darrin.
Mighty provoc Where did you get that?
This?
Samantha gave it to me.
It's Well, in case we go out to lunch, and you have some spaghetti or lobster or What else is kind of drippy?
You want a straight answer?
The Saturday work must be getting to him.
Must be getting to me too.
Aunt Clara.
Eight to five, it's Aunt Clara.
Tabatha.
Lovely.
I knew it all the time.
I knew it.
I knew it.
- Wonderful.
- Simply wonderful.
That was wonderful.
Well, it's all over.
Wait until you hear the results.
Well, that's it.
Tabatha has been tested by the approved methods and standards.
And I come to the conclusion that despite the fact she's a product of a mixed marriage her powers are amazing and she shows a great potential.
Therefore, I, Hagatha do hereby declare and certify the child Tabatha to be a true and verified witch.
- Lovely tea, Samantha.
- Thank you, Aunt Clara.
Well, let's finish up here, girls.
We have some decisions to make about Tabatha.
Decisions?
What decisions?
We have to decide what Tabatha's whole future is going to be.
I think that's a matter for Darrin and me to decide, don't you?
Yes, well, after all, they are the mummy and daddy.
Quiet, Clara.
You too, Samantha.
It's our responsibility.
Well, I don't see it that way.
You will.
Sam, what is going on here?
Who?
- Darrin, dear.
- Who are these?
These These - Darrin?
Dear?
- What?
This is my aunt Hagatha and my aunt Enchantra.
This is Darrin, my husband.
Tabatha's father.
Well, well.
Yes, indeed.
Well, I suppose it's a matter of taste.
Yes.
De gustibus and all that.
Pity.
It's getting late and we still have some decisions to make.
Let's get on with it.
- With what?
Get on with what?
- Don't interrupt, Darwood.
Darling, they've been testing Tabatha and they've found out that her magical powers are very, very strong.
Well, I guess we'll just have to live with it, that's all.
Quiet.
Clara, any comments?
Well, yes.
Yes, of course.
L And on the other hand, you know Thank you, Clara.
Enchantra?
In view of the fact that Tabatha is the first witch of her generation and because of her importance in the hierarchy I feel she should be immediately sent to your school.
I agree.
I agree with Enchantra.
After all, Samantha went to Hagatha's school.
All the really chic people did.
- Now, wait a minute!
- You're interrupting again.
I'm the father, and I have a few questions.
Where is this school?
That, young man, is none of your business.
Now, Aunt Enchantra, really.
Mother, this has gone far enough.
Testing Tabatha was one thing but decisions about her future, that's something else.
Right.
This is our business.
Tabatha is our daughter and Miss Tabatha Stephens is going to our public schools.
That's it!
I have spoken.
How dare you.
Easy.
How dare you talk to us in that tone of voice.
You impudent nothing.
You mortal.
Don't you talk to my husband like that.
He has every right to say what he thinks.
This is his house, and Tabatha is his daughter.
You know, I think I have a wonderful idea.
Well, I thought Now, what was that?
Oh, yes!
Oh, yes.
Now, why doesn't Enchantra move in and stay with you as Tabatha's teacher?
Not a chance.
Not a prayer.
Well, if you feel as strongly as that maybe we'd better think about it some more.
Sort of m Mull it over.
There will be no mulling.
Everybody out!
I've had enough of the whole kit and caboodle of you.
Out!
Out!
Bravo.
Bravo.
Well, I mean, you have to admit that he said that with a great deal of spirit.
Well, I agree with Darrin.
Tabatha stays here.
That's our decision, and it's final.
Girls.
I don't hear you.
What?
What did you say?
Oh, listen, dears, speak louder.
I can't hear a word you say.
No, I can't Can't hear you.
Oh, well, it doesn't matter.
Whatever they say, I'm on your side.
Samantha.
It really hurts me that you've drifted so far from our tradition and your great heritage.
Now, we've heard your decision.
Now hear ours.
You're both obviously incompetent to raise a child as important as Tabatha.
Therefore, we're sending her to Hagatha's school at once.
That child leaves this house only over my dead body!
Unfortunately, that won't be necessary.
Girls.
Sam, I can't move my feet.
I can't either.
Mother, you stop this.
Well, of all the chintzy tricks.
Tabatha?
That's kidnapping!
How dare you?
Mother, you're going to be so sorry for this.
You just wait That's enough out of all of you.
Girls.
You may be angry now, Samantha but we're doing this for Tabatha's own good.
You'll thank us for it later on.
And I'm sure your father would approve.
Trouble, Samantha?
All right.
I get the picture.
A little bit of witch-napping, eh?
Oh, go back to your opera, Maurice, and stop interfering.
That baby belongs in her room.
Now then, take the spell off them.
- Unthinkable.
- We'll do no such thing.
Out of the question.
It's for our grandchild's own good.
Why, you muddling, bumbling bunch of creaking old crones.
- I ought to - Oh, Maurice, stop the theatrics.
Honestly, I think you should've been an actor instead of a warlock.
Perhaps, and I should have been the greatest of them.
I should have played Hamlet.
O that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw, and resolve itself into a dew or that the Everlast All right, all right.
I heard you the first time.
Maurice, will you please leave?
You'll miss your favourite aria.
No, I won't.
They can't put the curtain up on the third act until I get back.
Take the spell off them.
Now, you have no right to interfere with this committee.
One word more out of you, madam, and And what?
Where are we?
Where are we?
Oh, it's so cold!
It's Mount Everest!
Oh, that ham.
I didn't think he'd dare.
Oh, I'm freezing.
We shall be here forever!
Oh, not I. I'm not dressed for it.
Oh, all right!
Maurice!
I think they'll be more flexible now.
Once they've thawed out.
Ladies, I'm waiting.
All right.
- Thank you, Daddy.
- Oh, yes.
There will be no more interfering with my grandchild.
Macbeth!
Ladies?
Well, ladies?
Well done, Daddy.
For you and my darling granddaughter, anything.
I'd like to thank you too, sir.
For you, nothing.
You happen to be just standing in the fallout of my love for my daughter.
- Gee, thanks, Dad.
- Watch it, boy.
Well, time for the third act of Faust.
Can't keep the curtain waiting any longer or Mephistopheles will have hysterics.
Maurice, would you mind dropping me?
Clara!
I can think of no nicer company.
Come along.
He's quite a guy, your father.
He's really very nice when you get to know him.
It's okay, honey.
I understand your father.
Under that suave, polished exterior, he hates me.
Well, that's all right, sweetheart.
Because under this smooth, girlish exterior, I love you.
Darrin?
Even though they found that Tabatha has great potential her powers are still very limited.
She is just a baby, after all.
I knew you'd understand.
Her powers may be limited, but her appetite isn't.
I'll handle it.
Daddy.
Just got her to sleep.
Two visits in one day.
What a marvellous surprise.
Well, I'm a grandfather.
I just thought I'd do a little bit of babysitting.
Why don't you and Dolphin go out for the evening?
Thank you, Daddy.
That would be wonderful.
The evening's on me.
Where would you like to go?
Bullfights in Madrid, skiing in Switzerland a cup of tea at the foot of Fujiyama?
What would you like to see?
Daddy, nothing in the world could top what I'm looking at right now.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Come on.
We have to be at the theatre by 8: 15 to pick up the tickets.
All right, darling, but we can't leave until Aunt Clara gets here, anyway.
That's when we shouldn't leave, when Aunt Clara gets here.
Why don't we hire a teenager or a nice little old lady to babysit?
It's a wild idea, but think of the novelty.
Very funny.
Until Tabatha learns to control her witchcraft, we have no other choice.
I think Aunt Clara's here.
One more time.
Well, I made it through.
You mean you opened it?
Well, you can't win them all.
Aunt Clara, we appreciate you babysitting for us.
We won't be late.
Now, you know there's nothing I'd rather do than be with Tabatha.
Now, have fun, have fun.
And we'll be fine.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
We were just leaving.
Sam, our babysitter just called and said she can't make it.
As long as you have Aunt Clara sitting with Tabatha could we bring Jonathan over?
Otherwise, I'm afraid you'll have to go to the play without us.
Well Yes.
Yes, I suppose that'll be all right.
Aunt Clara can babysit for both of them.
Fine, Larry.
Bye.
Sam, Aunt Clara sitting with Tabatha is one thing.
Tabatha can always hold her own with the: You think we can leave her with two babies?
Oh, now, Darrin, don't worry.
Let's not borrow trouble.
Borrow it?
Who needs to borrow it?
We get a daily supply.
Well, I guess everything's all set.
You won't forget how to give Tabatha her bottle?
Oh, heavens, no.
I take a drop of milk and put it on the elbow to test it and then I put it in the baby's mouth.
The bottle, not the elbow.
Come on.
I'll remind you how to use the bottle warmer.
Come on, Larry.
We'd better be going.
I can't get over how Jonathan's growing.
It's already his second birthday.
Tomorrow he'll be 2.
Well, congratulations.
I wish I would have known.
We'd have had a celebration, put a nipple on a bottle of champagne.
I tell you, Darrin, there's nothing like having a son.
Only thing I'd rather have is a daughter.
But a son can grow into something a father can be proud of like a leader of industry or a scientist or even the President of the United States.
Lar, when your young president gets married he'll have somebody's daughter telling him how to run the country.
You wouldn't believe the way he's changing from day to day.
Here, I got a couple of pictures to show you.
Why do I have to look at pictures?
The kid's standing right there.
Here, look at this: Is that an expression?
Is that a face?
Well, if you really want to see something - How about that?
- Not bad.
One day, the mean, nasty wolf went to the first piggy's house and he huffed and he puffed and in one breath, he blew the whole house down.
Hard to believe, isn't it?
I think that's enough bedtime stories now.
Now then, what else can we do to have fun?
Oh, I know.
Aunt Clara will perform some magic for you.
Now, look closely.
Nothing up my sleeves.
Now the magic words.
My sleeves.
No sleeves.
Well wasn't what I had in mind, of course.
Well, now, let's try again.
Maybe the words were wrong.
Oh, my goodness.
I wanted a pony.
This is for you, Tabatha.
Now we'll try to get that pony for Jonathan.
Pinch a freckle One to boot But you're not a pony.
Two Jonathans.
What did I say, so I can make them one again?
Fleck a tag Yes, yes.
Fleck a tag Pinch a wallaby Now I get a pony.
Well, that was good enough, wasn't it?
- Wasn't she a marvellous dancer?
- Beautiful.
- Tall girl, she was just marvellous.
- How about a cup of coffee?
No, thanks, Darrin.
I have to catch that 9:00 plane for Chicago.
Which means that I have to get up at 6 to pack for him.
And I have to get up at 5 to feed the baby.
- I'll go get Jonathan.
- Oh, boy.
Well, I'd better go and see about the bottle warmer.
Now, you Oh, hello, dear.
- Aunt Clara?
- Just a minute.
Aunt Clara, may I come in?
Right away.
- What are you doing?
- Tidying up.
Tidying up.
My sleeves.
Oh, my sleeves came back.
Well, that's a step in the right direction.
I think.
Come on, darling.
Come in, dear.
What on earth?
Yes, we We were just playing.
Playing?
Where?
There isn't any room.
Oh, and why are the children up?
Really, Aunt Clara.
Now, there's a reason for that.
What was that?
Oh, you mean the noise like a baby gurgling.
Yes.
I didn't hear it.
There are two of them.
Two of them.
And I don't know how I did it.
But, Aunt Clara.
Well, you have to try and remember that spell.
You're the only one who can remove it.
How am I gonna explain this?
Suppose we say that he was taken by the gypsies and has just been returned.
Aunt Clara, which one is the real Jonathan?
Well, you see, that's I don't know.
- You don't know?
- No, I don't know.
Now look, I am going to go downstairs and try and stall them.
Now, you just rack that dear, sweet brain of yours and think of that spell.
I will.
Now, don't go to pieces, dear.
You just be calm and concentrate and I'm sure it'll come to you.
And even if it doesn't, our troubles are over.
They are?
Because when Darrin finds out, he'll fix everything.
He'll kill us.
Oh, if I could remember that spell.
Oh, dear.
Bentley Who?
Oh, I'm such a dumb witch.
- What's taking Sam so long?
- I'll go give a look.
- Is everything all right, honey?
- Fine, darling.
While we wait for Aunt Clara to bundle up Jonathan how about a game of bridge?
Sam, I have to be up early to catch that plane.
- A quick game of chess?
- "A quick game of chess"?
Well Four-handed gin rummy?
Really, Samantha, we have to be going.
Oh, now, Louise.
It isn't that late.
They stay up later than this in a senior citizen city.
I'll fix some coffee.
Sam, we really don't want any.
- It'll only take a minute.
- Sam, they don't want any coffee.
- A nice cup of tea, then?
- Oh, please, Sam, no.
I know, hot chocolate.
Make you sleep like a baby, Larry.
Sam, they don't want anything to drink.
I'll fix us something to eat then.
Sam, we really don't want anything.
I swear it.
- Oh, but I insist.
- What?
- "What" what?
- Sam.
Larry's going to Chicago tomorrow.
It'll be sort of a bon voyage party.
Midnight luau.
- Luau?
- Luau.
- Sam, I wanna talk to you.
- What about?
- Okay, Sam, out with it.
- Out with what?
I've been married to you long enough to know when something's wrong.
Well, Darrin it's Aunt Clara.
- What about her?
Why do I keep getting the feeling that I'm being held a prisoner?
What?
Never mind, dear.
Family affair.
Not so loud.
- Two Jonathans?
- Well, darling Aunt Clara will think of the spell.
Everything will be fine.
How long can you stall Larry and Louise?
They wanna take their kid home.
Can't we let them take one home?
- Darrin, you can't do that.
- Why?
Because one is Jonathan and the other is Aunt Clara's magic.
- We don't know which one's which.
- Oh, fine.
We have to keep the two babies together or the spell won't work.
Now, let's go outside and stall them.
Stall them how?
How?
How?
How?
Samantha, we really do have to be going.
- Now, if we can just have Jonathan - I have an idea.
No, please.
I don't wanna play games or eat or dance or anything.
I just want to get some sleep.
As long as Jonathan is already asleep, why not let him spend the night?
- Right, Darrin?
- Oh, yeah, right.
Then you wouldn't have to get up at 5 to feed him, Larry.
- You could sleep till almost plane time.
- Yeah.
- Hey, that's a thought.
- Oh, I don't know, Larry Oh, good.
Then it's all settled.
Louise can pick up Jonathan after she's taken you to the airport.
- Well, just a minute, Samantha - Have a good trip, Larry.
- Good night.
- Night-night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- What a relief.
- What do you mean?
We're still up to here in trouble.
Oh, if I could only remember that spell now.
- Aunt Clara, you did it.
- Oh, well, not entirely.
I made the toys disappear.
What toys?
Never mind.
I don't think I wanna hear about it.
But I'm not getting anywhere with him.
Or with him.
Oh, dear, I'm getting all the "finchleys" and "bixleys" and "bixeys" mixed up.
Why can't I have the ordinary, wonderful, everyday problems that every other husband has?
Eight-thirty.
Louise will be here in an hour to pick up Jonathan.
What if the answer isn't in that witchcraft book?
I've got it.
Positively.
What?
That's the spell?
Well, that's the first half of it.
- Oh, good, good.
- Good?
- Well, half a spell is better than none.
- Not in this case, Darrin.
Because even with half a spell we still have twins.
Keep trying, Aunt Clara.
I'll get it.
- Good morning, Darrin.
- Oh, Louise.
What are you doing here?
Well, obviously, I came to pick up Jonathan.
- May I come in?
- Sure.
Good morning.
What are you doing here so early?
Oh, Larry took a taxi to the airport so I could sleep.
Then I found I couldn't sleep without a baby in the house.
- Slight case of "motheritis" I guess.
- Yeah.
Well, have a seat, Louise.
I'll tell Sam you're here.
- It's Louise.
- Oh, no.
Now, we'll get Louise out on the patio somehow.
Now, Aunt Clara, when the coast is clear you take the other twin and sneak him upstairs.
- I will.
- Come on, Darrin.
You take Tabatha.
Okay.
- Ready?
- Ready.
- Hi, Louise.
- Oh, good morning, Samantha.
Jonathan, honey, did you have a good time?
Come on, come to Mommy.
- You're just in time for breakfast.
- Oh, no, thanks, Samantha.
As long as I got an early start, there are things I might as well get done.
Have a cup of coffee.
I'll bring it out to the patio.
- No, I really have to be running.
- You can't.
- Why not?
- I mean, not yet.
- Why not?
- Why not?
Well, because today is Jonathan's birthday.
That's right.
It's Jonathan's birthday.
- Larry said so last night.
- And we've planned a party.
A party?
Why, isn't that sweet?
I don't want you to go to any trouble, Sam.
Oh, no trouble at all.
Oh, no.
No, Louise.
No trouble.
Why, I can have everything ready just like that: There.
Now, why don't we all go to the party?
Come on, Jonathan, Tabatha, darling.
- Louise, take a look.
- Oh, it's darling.
What a lovely surprise.
Freckles and Freckles and No.
No, that's wrong too.
No.
No, that's not it.
No.
Finch a boot?
Tag a pinch Excuse me.
Good morning, Aunt Clara.
Well, well, well.
How's my little guy, huh?
- Has he been behaving?
- Oh, yes.
Just like an angel.
Like two angels.
- Oh, that's marvellous.
- Yes.
- Hi, Larry.
- Sam.
- Why aren't you in Chicago?
- Well, the airport's all fogged in so I thought I'd pick up Jonathan and save Louise a trip.
Aunt Clara, why don't you go upstairs and work out that little problem, fast?
Yes.
Oh, and just in case will you keep an open mind about a larger family?
Well, I have to get back to the airport.
I've just got time to get him home and celebrate his birthday with Louise.
But, Larry, we're having a birthday party for him here.
That's really sweet of you, Sam, but you shouldn't have gone to any trouble.
Oh, it's no trouble.
It's all set up in the kitchen.
No more trouble than that: Oh, this is too much.
You and Darrin are the greatest.
Darrin, it was so nice of you and Sam to plan such a lovely birthday party.
It was nothing, Louise, nothing at all.
But I think I will have that cup of coffee after all.
- Okay.
Let's all go into the kitchen.
- All right.
There we go.
Why don't you take a whistle, huh?
There you go.
Come on.
And a birthday hat for Jon 0-2.
Sam, we Louise, the kitchen's such a mess, I'm sure Sam wouldn't want you to see it.
Let's go back on the patio.
Well, what was that all about?
We were playing hide-and-seek with the babies.
Darrin's trying to hide.
Excuse me.
Well, shall we join the party, birthday boy?
You sit right here, Louise.
I'll get you that coffee.
This is really turning into a surprise party.
What's?
Louise, it's getting a little chilly out here.
- Why don't we all go in the den?
- Good idea.
Wouldn't want the kids to catch cold.
Come on.
I'm beginning to feel like a yo-yo.
Come on.
Where shall we hide, huh?
Hide.
That's right.
Come on.
Here we go.
You go right ahead.
I'll get the coffee.
Larry Larry?
- Much better in here, huh, Louise?
- Well, I was fine on the patio.
Why don't I get the camera and take some birthday pictures?
- I'd love it, if it's no trouble.
- Oh, no trouble.
I got it right here.
- What was that?
- What?
Oh, that noise.
Yeah, much too noisy in here for me too.
If you'd prefer the patio - I didn't say that I'd - It's much better on the patio.
It's a little too warm in the den, Sam.
The patio is better.
You go out there and I'll get sweaters for the babies.
- Okay.
Tabatha.
- Oh, my stars.
I thought I heard Louise.
Did you hear your mommy talking?
Could be a dream.
Say, maybe I am on my way to Chicago.
Is this a birthday party or am I in training for the Olympics?
- Louise.
- Larry, you're in Chicago.
The flight was delayed.
How did you get Jonathan?
The stork brought him.
- I mean, Samantha just took him - Why don't you two go on out on the patio and have some cake?
I'll take Jonathan upstairs and put his sweater on him.
Well, what?
After all, last time I was much younger.
Last time?
You mean this happened before?
Well, it wasn't quite the same.
When?
Can you remember when it happened?
Ten years ago.
Oh, I have a very good mind for dates.
And then you remembered the spell?
Remember?
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Then you'll remember it now.
From the fountain of youth A drink I pour You're 10 years younger Than you were before.
Why, I haven't had this dress on for years.
Can you remember the spell now, Aunt Clara?
Yes.
Yes, I've got it.
I think I've got it.
Sam.
- Sam, they saw each other.
- It's perfectly all right.
Aunt Clara's remembered the spell.
I hope.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
Oh, I know I'm a little vague at times but, on the other hand, when I forget something l'm definite.
That's not quite what I meant Go ahead, Aunt Clara.
One to boot - She did it.
- Yeah.
How about that?
Well, we better get Jonathan downstairs.
What have you done to yourself?
You look different.
Oh, Samantha did that.
I'm 10 years younger.
Ten years younger?
Well, those 10 years certainly went by faster than they did the first time around, didn't they?
Darrin?
- Darrin?
- Coming, Larry.
- Well, that was some birthday party.
- Yeah, if that's what it was.
- What do you mean?
- Well, what do you think it was?
Well, I don't know.
What was it?
Well, here we are.
Well, not to be a birthday party-pooper, but I have to get to the airport.
- Just wanted to kiss my boy goodbye.
- Well, help yourself, old dad.
Oh, here you go.
So long, slugger.
Be a good boy.
- See you tomorrow, Mommy.
- Bye, dear.
You know, I wish I had another one just like him.
Now he tells us.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
- Darrin?
- Yeah?
A cab just drove up.
It must be what's-his-name.
The friend of your great-aunt Leticia's from Ireland.
- Gerry O'Toole?
Oh, no.
- What's the matter?
This is one morning I can't afford to be late to the office.
I hate to do this, but I have to sneak out the back door.
- Well, that's not very hospitable.
- But look at the time.
Surely you can take just a minute to say hello.
You can't say hello to an Irishman in a minute.
I'll see him when I get home tonight.
All right.
He's not my great-aunt Leticia's friend.
Relax.
I didn't even remember I had a great-aunt Leticia until she wrote.
- Bye, honey.
- I should think you'd be curious to meet someone from Derrybrien.
- Not a bit.
Sure, and you must be Darrin, or my name isn't Gerry O'Toole.
- Gerry?
- For Geraldine.
Oh, it's a darling home you have.
- A darling home.
- Thank you.
So you're Darrin.
Your great-aunt told me what a darling man you were.
She only said that because it's true.
What?
Oh, yeah.
- She's got a great sense of humour.
- She's a darling.
How about a cup of tea?
Oh, no, no.
I don't want you to go to any trouble on my account.
- Oh, it's no trouble.
- I'll not be a burden to you.
I want to be treated just like one of the family during my stay.
Oh, well, now, Gerry, a cup of tea certainly isn't How long are you gonna be able to stay?
Well, just till I get started.
Started with what?
Well, the first thing I'd best be doing is finding myself a job.
What sort of work do you do, Gerry?
Well, if I do say so myself, I'm pretty good at weaving.
Maybe I can find you something in the garment industry.
Or you might even get a job as a model.
A model.
Sure, and you're playing games with me.
Isn't he?
Not yet.
You don't have a cat here in the house, now, do you?
- That's the baby.
- The baby.
Right.
Ain't that darling?
- You don't like cats?
- That I don't.
The way they're always sneaking around and jumping at you when you least expect it.
While you take care of the baby, I'll show Gerry to the guest room.
That's a marvellous idea.
While Darrin's taking care of the baby l'll show you to the guest room.
I must say, Samantha, it was a wonderful dinner.
Thank you, Gerry.
Honey, you can't fix that.
The hole's this big.
Well, I can always make another sleeveless sweater out of it.
- It's too late.
- Too late?
I'm afraid I mended it before dinner.
Let me see, honey.
That's about the best reweaving job I ever saw.
Yes.
It's most unusual.
Oh, my!
What a lovely garden you have out there.
Would you be a darling and show it to me?
Well, sure.
Come on, honey.
No, you two darlings go ahead.
Well, I've heard of being handy with a needle, but this is ridiculous.
And what's even more ridiculous is your gullibility, my dear.
Did you ever see a human who could do weaving like that?
Mother, Gerry's a friend of Darrin's great-aunt.
If she is, I'm his great-uncle.
- You mean she's one of us?
- No.
Just think a minute.
Hates cats.
A wood nymph.
And there's only one thing a wood nymph hates worse than a cat.
And that's a witch.
- A witch.
- Yes.
- Well, I wonder what she wants.
I don't know, but you'd better find out.
And fast.
Bye.
Oh, Samantha, it's a lovely garden you have.
Well, thank you, Gerry.
Darling, I thought I heard the baby.
Would you mind taking a peek?
Sure.
Maybe Gerry would like to watch television.
- I have other entertainment in mind.
- Well, good.
All right, you.
What do you want here?
Why, whatever do you mean?
You're a wood nymph, aren't you?
Right you are.
That I am.
And I don't mind telling you it's a great relief to be getting it off me chest.
- Well, I mean, the burden of carrying - Hold it.
Never mind the blarney.
I want to know what you're doing here.
Well as you must know, it's the work of a wood nymph to bless the homes of all the true sons of the old sod.
And me, I've been taking care of Darrin's family for centuries.
And that's why I come.
We've been in this house for over two years.
What took you so long?
Well, we are a bit behind in the schedule.
I mean, especially with the immigrants.
The fact that I'm married to Darrin doesn't bother you?
You mean because you're a witch?
Oh, no.
Of course not.
That's all changed now.
It's forgive and forget, that's our feelings now.
Really?
Well, I'm surprised Mother didn't know about that.
That's only because it isn't true.
It's not?
Now, look here, woody.
- Baby's okay, honey.
- Oh, dear.
She's as snug as a Sorry I had to put you in the deep freeze, but we have to thrash this out.
All right.
Now, I want the truth.
If you don't tell me why you're really here, I'll let them in.
No, no.
Don't be doing that.
- Will you tell me the truth?
- Yes, yes.
Don't let them in.
Well?
It's the curse of Killcarney County that's brought me here.
- The curse of what?
- Killcarney County.
That was the manor house of Darrin the Bold.
He was an ancestor to your Darrin.
And he lived in the 15th century.
Well, what did Darrin the Bold do?
He slew Rufus the Red, that's what he did.
He was a darling man and a good friend.
The way he'd always leave little bits of food out on the doorstep so we'd never go hungry.
And when Darrin slew him we put a curse on him and on all his descendants.
So now you know.
But that's not fair.
My Darrin didn't have anything to do with it.
Well, I know that, but a curse is a curse.
And I shouldn't have to be telling the likes of you that.
Mother!
Mother, you're going to have to do something.
Oh, Samantha, please don't carry on so.
It's embarrassing and human.
Now, actually, he just might survive this curse, you know?
Suppose he doesn't.
Well, we can't fight progress.
Mother!
Now, I choose to believe that you're joking but whether you are or not, I am not going to take this lying down.
Now, do you remember when all this happened?
The exact date, I mean?
Sure I do.
It's burned in me memory.
Why, we even made up a poem about it: 'Twas the 12th of Michaelmas In '72 When Darrin the Bold Our Rufus did slew It was a better rhyme in the 15th century.
Yes, well All right, how about a temporary truce?
- Well, l - You've waited 500 years.
Now, a few hours can't make any difference.
I don't think All right, all right.
- Mother?
- What?
I'd like to speak to you in private.
As soon as I get him back in circulation.
- Bug in a rug.
- Excuse me.
- Oh, sure.
Would you like to watch TV?
There's a good movie on.
- Oh, what is it?
- The Cat and the Canary.
Why don't we just sit down and have a little chat.
Well, that suits me.
Samantha, you can't be serious.
Oh, but, Mother, it's the only way.
- "Undo the Deed" is the only way.
- No.
Oh, Mother, please let's try "Undo the Deed".
I wish you'd stop referring to it as if it were some parlour game instead of one of the most dangerous of all practices.
If I can go back to the 15th century, I can stop Darrin the Bold from killing Rufus the Red, and the curse will be removed.
You don't realize how risky it is.
Once you go back in time, you won't be able to use your witchcraft.
- I know.
- You have only your wits to rely on.
Well, I realize that it's a risk, but that's the chance I'll have to take.
Oh, Samantha, I cannot let you do it.
Mother, somebody has to go back to the 15th century to save Darrin's life.
You wanna do it?
Samantha get ready for takeoff.
To undo the deed That once was done To now undo the deed That's done Into the past The days do run We seek the day The deed was done Take care of the baby, Mama, and Darrin.
I think Donald is being well taken care of.
You're beautiful, baby.
You're marvellous.
Sire!
This is good, but you're better.
Oh, please, sire.
I have to finish me work upstairs.
Not until you finish your work downstairs.
Well.
Your tankard of ale, sire.
And what is your name, lass?
Samantha, sire.
Samantha.
Oh, that's a lovely name.
It's lovely, lovely.
Upstairs, wench, and finish your work!
Tell me something, girl.
Aye?
How is it that the likes of you has escaped me notice when there's a light about you that shines forth like a beacon at sea and your hair all golden around your head and your eyes sending out an invitation to any man who has eyes for a girl with spirit and fire?
- How's that again?
- Where have you been all me life?
I was waiting for you to come to Killcarney.
My name is Darrin the Bold.
Well, sure, and I didn't think you were Darrin the Meek.
I dearly love a saucy lass.
Oh, the beauty of you takes my breath away.
You are a knockout.
If it's taming you want, you came to the right place.
If you'll excuse me, sire, I have to get back to me duties in the kitchen.
Oh, but a lass like you shouldn't be slaving away in the kitchen.
You're much too pretty for that.
How would you like to move up in the world?
- Move up?
- I want you at me side.
Oh, well, thank you, sire.
But I'm not thinking of marriage right now.
Neither am I. I'm thinking of making you the upstairs maid you little vixen, you.
Don't be afraid of me, lass!
Don't be afraid of me, Darrin.
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
Where is everybody?
- Your wife's away on an emergency.
- Where?
Oh, I'm that sorry.
Did I hurt you, sire?
Me, Darrin the Bold, who's faced the fierceness of the Norman foe and taken the measure of the murthering English hurt by a frail lass like you?
Oh, boy, you don't know your own strength, girl.
A noble lord waits without and would speak with you, sire.
Let him enter!
Enter!
I am Rufus the Red.
I am Darrin the Bold.
I would set up me camp in your fields for the night.
You may do so.
You will provide grain for the horses and food for my men?
- Lf you pay.
- A guest does not pay.
- A guest is invited.
- I do not pay!
I do not give!
Pay.
Give.
You've got a great deal to learn about chivalry, sir.
Do you prefer to duel on foot or mounted?
On foot.
That way, you'll be closer to your grave.
- At my camp?
- Within the hour.
So be it.
- Come!
- Sire I must speak with ye.
What is it, lass?
In private.
Oh, in private it is.
I'll see you in my room, anon.
- But - Anon!
- Who goes there?
- 'Tis I. You belong to Darrin, do you not?
I belong to no man.
Well, now, come in, come in.
And what can I do for you, lass?
Would you put your wee boot on that, sire?
Height, 6'3".
- Well, what are you doing?
- Oh, don't pay any attention to me.
Waist, 36.
Now, place your arms so, sire.
Now breathe in.
Now out.
Will you tell me what you're doing?
First, what do you weigh?
Thirteen stone eight, but Oh, no doubt about it.
I'm going to need a very sturdy cloth.
What are you talking about, lass?
Well, would you believe it?
The last few souls that challenged his master came right through the shrouds.
Shroud?
You're measuring me for a shroud?
Oh, not a thing to worry about, sire.
I'm the best shroud-maker in the country.
And you work for Darrin the Bold?
Only for the master, sire.
Why, there aren't enough hours in the day or night for me to make all the shrouds I have to make.
He keeps you that busy?
Well, I'm not sure about that, sire.
Perhaps it would be fairer to say that the men who challenge the master keep me that busy.
Why, just last month, he Well, come in, lass, come in.
Please, sire, I've come to speak to you on a matter of grave importance.
Go ahead, lass, I'm listening.
Somehow I'm getting the feeling that I don't appeal to you.
Oh, no, no, sire.
I really like you.
It's just that I'm shy.
If you were any shier, I'd be bruised from head to toe.
What is this matter of grave importance?
Well, I just happened to be walking by the camp of Rufus the Red and I overheard some of his men talking.
Now, whatever you do, don't fight Rufus on foot.
He's killed over a hundred men that way.
A hundred men - A hundred men, you say?
- Aye.
Why do you think they call him Rufus the Red?
Not because of his hair?
Because of: Perhaps it would be wiser if I fought him mounted.
It would be, except that he's killed even more men on horseback.
If I were you, I'd try some other way.
What other way is there?
Well, how about a nice wrestling match?
You seem to be very good at that.
Enter!
Oh, Muldoon, it's not time for the duel yet.
There's no rush.
There's no duel, sire.
There's not?
Why not?
Rufus the Red has sent men to pay for the food and grain they need.
You don't say.
Oh, that's terrific.
I mean, the saints be praised.
So the snivelling coward backed out of the duel?
Yes.
But if you want to go ahead with it, sire No!
After all, the man is my guest.
Yes, sire.
I'm wondering what made Rufus change his mind.
Well, sire maybe he heard what a brave fighter you are and of all the great battles you've won and the fierce dragons that you've killed.
Aye, that would strike fear in What dragons?
I never fought a dragon.
- You haven't?
- No.
Not that I can remember.
Well, I wouldn't mention that to Rufus.
He somehow got the impression that you hold the world's record for dragon slewing Slaying.
Now, if you'll excuse me, sire, me work here is finished.
Oh, no, it's not.
Mother!
I knew the lass had spirit, but this is ridiculous.
Are you all right?
Oh, me poor darling.
- I really fell head over heels.
- Oh, it's all my fault.
Oh, no, you tried to warn me.
Oh, look, Gerry Gerry Gerry, please.
I think I better tell you something.
I'm very much in love with my wife and if you don't stop chasing me around l'll be on crutches by the time Samantha gets back.
Well, well.
When the cat's away, the mouse will play, won't she?
Or try to.
Well, l I was just trying to give a bit of comfort to the poor man.
Sure you were.
Well, Gerry, me darling, you'll be happy to know that you can leave now.
I've undone the killing of Rufus the Red and the curse on Darrin Stephens has been lifted.
I don't believe you.
Well, go home.
You'll find out.
I'm not budging till I have positive proof.
- Well, how else can I prove it?
- That'll not be a problem of mine.
Well, if you won't go back there's only one thing I can do.
- Mother?
- Yes, dear?
She wants positive proof.
You shall have it.
- Rufus, me darling.
- Gerry, my love.
Oh, Samantha, I want you to meet a darling man the love of my life, Rufus the Red.
We've sort of met.
Is that you, Samantha?
Oh, dear.
Yes, Darrin.
Don't tell me he's here.
I'd hate to have to explain all this, so if you don't mind?
Not in the least.
It's happy indeed, you've made me.
Come, darling.
Goodbye, Samantha.
You're a love!
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Did you miss me?
- I sure did.
With someone like Gerry to keep you company?
- Oh, come on.
- She's awful pretty.
But, Sam, she's too aggressive.
She's gonna have trouble getting a man.
Oh, I don't think so.
By the way, she told me to tell you goodbye.
She left?
How come?
Well, you might say she got her old job back.
Good.
Anyway, I'm glad to see you.
Darrin?
You ever thought of growing a moustache?
No.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
A teddy bear.
Oh, really, Tabatha.
Mustn't twitch.
You know, lately you've been positively Mother?
Mother, have you been encouraging her again?
I have told you that I will not stand for any witchcraft in this house.
Especially where Tabatha's concerned.
Now, that's final.
Oh, dear.
I'm going to have to have a very serious talk with your grandmother.
Oh, come now, Samantha.
One more word about that dreadful lady, and I'll have to go.
Uncle Arthur.
- What are you doing in there?
- I've been framed.
Oh, Uncle Arthur, it's so good to see you.
Sammy, dear, you just keep getting prettier and prettier.
Where have you been?
It's been much too long.
It certainly has if you've started making speeches to yourself.
Who do we have to thank for that?
The Wicked Witch of the West?
Now, Uncle Arthur, you stop that.
I can see you haven't changed a bit.
Neither have your jokes.
Teddy bear.
Uncle Arthur's here, sweetie.
Oh, Sammy, she's beautiful.
Well, I wouldn't say that.
But I'm awfully glad to hear you say it, or anyone else, for that matter.
There's your little bear, sweetie.
And how's my darling sister?
I gather from the speech you're rehearsing she's playing the grand smother-in-law right to the hilt.
No, but she pops in an awful lot.
How do we get the old crone to pop out?
Old crone, is it?
I've a good mind to pop you out right into the next century.
Endora.
Speak of the devil.
You won't believe this, but we've been talking about you.
You call yourself my brother?
Only when I'm forced to, Endora.
I deny it as much as possible.
- Now, Uncle Arthur, mother, please.
- Oh, it's too late.
You've seen the last of me.
I'm leaving, never to return again.
Marvellous.
See, that didn't take long.
I'm only here to help.
I haven't left yet.
Well, hurry it up, will you?
We'd like to be alone.
You made her awful mad, Uncle Arthur.
No telling what she'll do.
Hi, honey.
Well, if it isn't my old yagga-zuzzie nephew-in-law.
- What's he doing here?
- He just got here.
Practically.
Didn't you, Uncle Arthur?
As a matter of fact, Mother was here too.
But I'm afraid they had words.
Words?
There's the understatement of the century.
The truth is, Uncle Arthur sent her away.
He sent your mother away?
Yes, you see Mother was so angry that she left swearing never to return again Uncle Arthur, I have never been so happy to see anybody in my life.
Uncle Arthur, old pal, old buddy.
Hiya, fella, glad to see you.
Put her there.
You know, your Uncle Ar How much longer is he going to stay here?
I don't mind his walking the baby so much as what he does to entertain her.
Pushing her stroller on a red carpet in front of Gladys Kravitz yet.
Dancing on the ceiling, turning himself into a 20-foot balloon.
You have every right to complain I'm not complaining, I'm not Yes, I am.
He's been here, what, three days?
Talk about influencing the baby.
And what he does to me.
That I'm not too crazy about either.
Complain, darling.
Don't rave.
I don't happen to think that a hotfoot made with real lightning is funny.
I don't know why.
Maybe I'm sick.
I am sick, sick of him.
The more I see of Uncle Arthur, the lovelier your mother becomes.
If I had to choose between the two, I'd take Endora any day.
The man has come to his senses at last.
He finally appreciates the real me.
- Mother, you're back.
- Naturally.
You didn't think I'd stay away and let that ridiculous excuse for a warlock exert his outrageous influence on my grandchild, did you?
And I want to thank you for your compliment, Darwin.
- Darrin.
- That's right Darwin.
Look at him.
He's practically cakewalking down the street.
Oh, he's such an exhibitionist.
Mother, what am I going to do?
I don't wanna hurt his feelings.
I love him, but I can't let him take over Tabatha.
The chances of that happening have been eliminated.
- They have?
- How?
Your mother is here.
Need I say more?
Yeah, yeah, much more.
What does that mean?
It means, from this moment on, I'm going to watch over Tabatha and protect her from that over-animated orang-utan.
- What?
- I've decided to move in on the corner.
- What corner?
- That one.
The house on the corner across the street.
There's no house.
It's a vacant lot.
It was a vacant lot.
Look again.
Endora.
It has to be Endora.
Who else?
The Madame Lafarge of all time.
I'll fix her wagon.
You just can't zap up a house on a vacant lot.
That lot belongs to somebody.
Somebody owns it.
You can't build on it without a permit.
Haven't you ever heard of a permit?
Never.
Well, you have heard of City Hall, county assessors, the Tax Department.
Oh, Samantha, he does get so tiresome.
Well, so do you when you won't listen to reason.
Don't you have any idea the trouble that can cause?
Endora.
Well, we certainly have missed you.
Long time, no see.
And we thought you said you were leaving for good.
Any resemblance between George Washington and myself is purely coincidental.
Rumour hath it you put that house on the corner.
I put my house on the corner.
Mother intends to live there.
- Over his dead body.
- Wait a minute.
Stop helping me.
You're not going to zap yourself a roost around here as long as I can help it.
That house goes.
Arthur, don't annoy me.
- I have spoken.
That house stays.
- Now, Mother.
Uncle Arthur, please.
You cannot put that house back there.
What would the neighbours think?
I don't care what the neighbours think.
Don't worry, Sammy, I won't let her be a nuisance to you and Tabatha.
Anything Mother Hubbard can zap, I can zap better.
Oh, Mother, please.
Now, wait a minute.
I can handle this.
Mother knows best.
So, Little Boy Blue if it's hostilities you want, it's hostilities you'll get.
All right, Abner, now tell me I'm crazy.
Now tell me I'm making things up.
There is a full-grown house that grew up out of nowhere.
See for yourself.
Gladys, how can I see for myself?
I'm in the doctor's office.
I got news for you, you're checking the wrong person.
Gladys?
Gladys?
Gladys?
Take a couple of aspirins and lie down.
I'll be right home.
Which will give you a fair idea of the kind of a nut I am.
Abner, don't you dare hang up on me.
Ever again.
I've heard all I care to hear.
- You're gonna hear a lot more, dimples.
- Dimples?
Tabatha is trying to take a nap, or doesn't anybody care?
I care.
And as far as I'm concerned, there's nothing more to be said.
- Are you all right, sweetheart?
- Oh, sure.
Other men have trouble with the finance company, the Tax Department.
But not me.
I got it soft.
So resign yourself, Charley Charming I have moved into the neighbourhood.
Resign yourself, Sally Sunshine you have just moved out.
Okay, who's fooling around?
I call it fooling around when a house is there one minute and gone the next when it never should have been there in the first place.
Are you sure you're the police?
I was right up until you called, lady.
Okay, okay.
I'll send somebody right over.
Okay, sergeant, we go to that address and we investigate a missing house.
A missing house?
- That's what I thought you said he said.
- I never argue.
It's back.
The house is back.
Is it back?
Of course it's back.
Do you think you're playing with children?
I sort of hate to do it, but I guess I'll have to paste her.
- Oh, Uncle Arthur, you wouldn't.
- Sam, leave him alone.
I mean, stay out of it, dear.
That's an excellent suggestion.
Don't you and Darwin have something to do somewhere else in the house?
Well, Darrin, how about some tea?
I'll heat the hot water.
Great idea.
Just what we need.
More hot water.
- Thank goodness you've come.
- Are you Mrs. Kravitz?
That's right.
I'm the one who called.
- This it?
- That's it.
That's the missing house.
Only it came back.
- You noticed?
- I noticed.
- Listen, Noel - Don't argue.
The thing is, the house doesn't belong here in the first place.
That's a vacant lot.
Oh, come on.
It sure is, lady.
I'll check inside with the lady.
You call in and check out the address.
- Okay, lady?
- Oh, yes.
Actually, this is a very strange neighbourhood.
But I can't get anybody to believe it, not even my husband.
Don't tempt me, little man, or I'll evaporate you.
How would you like to be turned into a half pint of sour cream?
I smell sulphur.
Probably something Mother said.
She can be very acid.
She can be a hurricane, an eight-day flood.
Name your disaster, that's Endora.
As for Uncle Arthur Darling, I know it's difficult.
But in their own way, they're trying to help.
Help?
Is this what you call help?
Sam, we agreed.
Normal.
Remember normal?
When we first married, we made a deal to have a normal married life.
Didn't you mean it?
I meant it.
That's all I wanted.
It's all I want now.
Well, that's all I want.
Problem is they both have equal power.
This could go on and on.
Enough is enough.
Mother?
Uncle Arthur?
Now listen to me, both of you.
I have had it.
I beg your pardon?
I love you, Mother, but Hear that?
"But".
I don't need any editorial comments from you, Uncle Arthur.
Anyway, you're next.
Now, Mother, listen to me.
I will not have my home turned into a re-enactment of the Civil War.
Did I make that plain?
I didn't say, "I wish you wouldn't," or "I don't want".
I said, "I will not".
If you expect me to apologize for something your Uncle Arthur I am not asking for an apology.
I am demanding privacy.
I'll admit I'm torn when we get into these witches' world versus mortal-world battles.
I see both sides, and I try to take both sides.
I try very hard to be fair.
But sometimes you can try so hard to be fair, you end up being nothing.
- As far as I'm concerned - Well, in my opinion From now on, I am taking sides.
I am showing favouritism, plenty of it.
All of it in Darrin and Tabatha's direction, right where it belongs.
She's got spunk all right, Endora.
Yes, of course.
She gets it from me.
I don't care where I get it.
The point is, if you're going to fight, you'll have to fight someplace else.
That or stop fighting completely.
Really, Samantha.
Just like that?
Yes.
Just like that.
Now, both of you, kiss and make up.
Go on, kiss her.
Things aren't that desperate.
Well, I'm afraid they are.
Now I am going to tell Darrin that peace reigns supreme one way or the other.
And when I come back here, I want evidence of it.
What did you say?
What happened?
What have you been doing?
Bluffing.
Oh, no, no, no.
I meant what I said, all right.
The problem is, if they don't buy it, I don't know how I'm gonna enforce it.
Frankly, I forget who started it.
I remember.
You did.
No, if memory serves me correctly, it began Oh, Arthur, forget it.
It began the day you were born.
Up until then, I was an only child.
Endora, if it's any comfort to you I've always thought of you as one.
Not only an only child, an only everything.
Why, Arthur.
- You like that?
- Why, yes, I do.
An only everything.
Which is probably why I tease you so unmercifully.
Out of sheer jealousy.
- That's probably it.
- And for kicks.
No question about that.
What you're leading up to, in your usual inadequate way is to do what Samantha asked, try to get along.
I know the thought is revolting, but Well, we could try, I suppose.
We could start by only seeing each other when we are invisible.
Yes, that's a good idea.
She's right, you know.
We have been turning her home into a civil war.
Remember the Civil War?
I was with General Lee.
I was with General Grant.
He had more booze.
- Invisible?
- Invisible.
And our separate ways?
- You go yours, I'll go mine.
- Fine.
First, we'll have to divvy up.
Which half of the world do you want?
Oh, that's very generous of you.
I'll take the top.
Noel?
Hey, Noel.
What is it, Floyd?
Come on in.
I'd just as soon you came outside and all, if it's all the same to you.
Well, for what it's worth, it looks like they're gone.
More important, it feels like they're gone.
My bluff must have worked.
How about that?
You know, sometimes I even surprise myself.
- Any idea where they've gone?
- No.
I'm sure that wherever they did go, they didn't go together.
They couldn't go away far enough or stay away long enough to suit me.
As a matter of fact I could do without a visit from any of your relatives for say, another two or three thousand years.
You know Get them back.
Get them back.
- Who?
- Your mother, Uncle Arthur, anybody.
It's still there.
The house is still there.
- Oh, no.
- Oh, yes.
And look who's in front of it.
The police.
Well, some more of Gladys Kravitz's handiwork, no doubt.
I'm telling you, Noel, I checked with City Hall.
There isn't any house here.
- Did you tell them there was?
- Yes.
- What did they say?
- They like to argue.
They say there's no permit, no registration, no nothing.
And they say if anybody did build a house here there's gonna be some trouble.
- Come on, let's go inside.
- Inside?
- Why?
- So you can see what I saw.
For a house that ain't here, it's got a lot of things going for it.
Hot and cold running water, electricity, inside plumbing.
Come on.
Are you sure you can make the house disappear?
Certainly, as long as Mother and Uncle Arthur are out of the way.
Wait a minute.
What happens if you make the house disappear while the police and Mrs. Kravitz are inside?
Oh, well, they will too.
- They will too what?
- Disappear.
Disappear where?
Don't answer that, okay?
As soon as they come out You know something?
I just figured it out.
I'm glad this house showed up out of nowhere.
If it hadn't, I wouldn't have reported it you wouldn't have come and seen it, and nobody would have believed it.
- I've got a flash for you.
- What?
- I still don't believe it.
- Don't argue.
Oh, poor old Mrs. Kravitz.
You know, sometimes my heart just goes right out to her.
I won't say anything if you won't say anything.
About what?
Twenty-nine, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 Honey, you or your mother ever keep a family album?
No, why?
Just wondering.
Someday Tabatha is going to grow old and she might wanna tell her great-grandchildren about her Uncle Arthur her Aunt Clara, Endora, Maurice.
How is she ever going to get them to believe her?
Simple.
She'll just introduce them.
I had to ask.
If you don't ask, you'll never learn.
Wonderful.
Alone at last.
Alone.
I knew it, I knew it.
I knew when you said, "You go your way and I'll go mine," I knew you'd come sneaking back here.
Isn't that exactly what you had in mind?
Well, if you think I'm going to let you stay around here and have free reign particularly with Halloween coming up Especially with Halloween coming up.
You're out of your ever-loving, nefarious mind.
You don't trust me?
I don't trust you.
Okay.
I got the picture.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Honey, you've got a choice.
There's a comedy at the Bijou, a Western at the Rialto an Egyptian epic at the Uptown.
I don't think it's right to go to a movie on Halloween.
It's like hiding out.
I think we should observe Halloween properly.
How?
Honey, it's been Halloween around here for the past week.
What, with your mother, Uncle Arthur, houses appearing and disappearing.
And appearing.
Sam, it's back.
Your mother's house is back.
- Darrin, do you love me?
- No.
I mean, yes, I love you but, no, I won't do what you want when you say, "Do you love me"?
Mother only wants that house back there for a little while.
And for one reason.
One reason?
The Halloween party tonight.
So that's what the Halloween talk was about.
- Mother's giving a party for friends.
- Not on my block, she isn't.
- And we're invited.
- Your mother created that house.
Well, she can just un-create it, and have her party someplace else.
Darrin, I'd so love to go.
The most interesting people are gonna be there.
Interesting, yes.
People, no.
I beg your pardon.
Sam, you know what I mean.
If somebody finds out, what will you tell them?
Well, people expect strange things to happen on Halloween.
Besides, nobody's gonna find out.
Greetings, folks.
Have you heard the glad tidings?
One Endora, mother of Samantha Stephens suburban housewife is giving a Halloween party this evening.
The catch to the story is that the guests will be real witches.
Buck up, Darrin.
It's gonna be a ball.
Darrin, where are you going?
This is no way to settle an argument.
Who's arguing?
Not me.
I am laying down the law.
That house of your mother's has got to go.
- As for Uncle Arthur - He's gone.
You can see for yourself.
No, I can't.
He could turn up in our goldfish bowl.
- We haven't got a goldfish bowl.
- Sam.
I want that house out of here.
Off of this street out of this neighbourhood, out of this world, immediately.
Or else.
Mother.
Mother, I have to talk to you.
- Mother?
- What is it that can't wait?
Me.
Where are you?
Outside?
Really, Samantha, you know I'm in the midst of all my party preparations.
Mother, Darrin is very upset.
Well, it's always nice to hear news like that, dear.
But I have all sorts of chores to do.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to forget about your chores.
And forget about the party.
Did I tell you that I've decided to make it a small gathering?
It makes it that much easier to keep Uncle Arthur out.
He is definitely not invited.
Mother, Darrin is adamant.
That house has got to go.
I can't hear you.
I can.
I heard everything you said, Sammy.
And everything she said.
Except that part about not inviting me to the party.
- Fortunately I missed that.
- I'll repeat it.
There's no point repeating it because there isn't going to be any party because there isn't going to be any house to have it in.
Now, Darrin said, "Or else".
And you know what that means.
- It means nothing to me.
- It means my marriage is at stake.
Oh, blast the house.
- I hope you're satisfied, missy.
- I'm very grateful.
Fine.
I was going to do my annual rendition of: "'Twas the Night Before Halloween".
We're gonna miss that?
Gee, I'm all choked up.
Anybody who'd knock anybody else out of a tree is sick.
Mother, really.
- Uncle Arthur, come on.
- Thank you, Sammy.
About your party, couldn't you have it somewhere else?
Why, Samantha, that's an excellent suggestion.
Brazil's lovely this time of year.
A little redoing here, a little highlighting there and probably a tinkling fountain might be nice.
Where?
Brazil?
- In your living room.
- Oh, Mother, no.
Too late.
Oh, Mother.
Oh, now, what's Darrin going to say?
You didn't expect me to ask my guests to come here the way it was, did you?
I'll add a few little things here and there.
Endora, you decorate the way you do everything else: In super, stupendous, glorious bad taste.
I wonder who that can be.
If that's who I think it is Oh, it is.
It's Gladys Kravitz.
Oh, what am I gonna do?
Allow me.
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Now ask me why.
Thank you, Uncle Arthur.
Think nothing of it, Sammy.
Now, what time do you want the life of the party to appear?
- Meaning you?
- Who else?
How about half past never?
She's joking.
She's not very good at it, but that's what she's doing.
And furthermore, Mother, as long as the party is being given in my house Uncle Arthur is invited.
That's blackmail.
Oh, no, it isn't.
That's love.
Hi.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Welcome home.
I was just looking out the window waiting for you to come home.
Swell, honey, but the neighbours Let's go inside.
- Wasn't it sweet of Mother?
- What?
Well, didn't you notice?
The house is gone.
Yeah, I noticed.
I just hope nobody else did.
She couldn't have been nicer.
And all she wanted was just one small, tiny little concession.
And in view of the large, magnificent magnanimous gesture on her part I felt the least we could do was to grant her one small, tiny little concession.
Which is?
To let her have the party here.
And you're especially invited.
Hey, I'm glad to hear that.
I'm being especially invited to a party that's being given at my own house.
Incidentally, when can I get into my own house?
In In just a minute.
I want to kind of prepare you first.
See, she's done a little redecorating.
You're just full of all kinds of good news, aren't you?
Can we go inside now?
Well, if you won't let it throw you.
Honey, believe me at this point nothing can throw me.
Samantha.
- Quite a party.
- Thank you, Durwood.
I flew the food in from all over the world.
- Personally, of course.
- Of course.
Thank you.
Have some champagne, darling.
I'm sure it's a very good year.
- For whom?
- Do have some champagne.
Thank you.
What?
What are you saying?
Oh, for Hecate's sake, there are two full cases on the service board.
It's so difficult to get good help nowadays.
And don't forget the caviar.
Or did I?
I did.
I completely forgot the caviar.
Beluga, beluga Sturgeon of the Caspian Sea Send your very best eggs to me Careful.
I bruise easily.
There you are, Endora, dear.
Caviar on the hoof.
How's that for charm?
That man's impossible.
Sam, you're a sweet child but your mother has always been first, last and foremost a witch.
Come, my darling.
I think this is the house.
Of course.
How silly of me.
Really, Boris.
Sometimes I wonder which one of us you prefer.
You're the more beautiful, my darling, but milk is cheaper than champagne.
Ab Let us go in.
I'm anxious to see Endora.
One moment.
I want to fix my fur.
Hair, my darling.
Until midnight it is hair.
Midnight?
Again?
Boris, why must I always leave a party just when it's getting started?
Because, my darling, you are a pussycat and rules are rules.
Your slip is showing.
Abner!
Abner!
Boris, how good of you to come.
Endora, my love.
And Eva.
I've set aside a saucer of milk, darling, for after midnight.
- You're too kind.
- Come in.
Gladys, you've called the police department the fire department and the SPCA.
Who are you calling now?
How many people have to tell you you're crazy?
Councilman Green, this is Gladys Kravitz chairwoman of the neighbourhood committee for your re-election.
Crazy but shrewd.
I'd like you to come out here right away and investigate a very strange party.
I see Boris has brought his "ghoulfriend".
Go on, darling.
It's the best.
Excuse me, darling.
Samantha.
My darling.
How wonderful to see you again.
Hello, Boris.
I'd like you to meet my husband, Darrin.
- I'm honoured.
- How do you do?
- May we have this dance?
- Darrin?
Be my guest.
Well, hello.
I don't think I know you.
I'm her husband, Darrin.
Darrin.
What a masculine name.
- Dance with me?
- All right.
I'm afraid I'm not up with the new dance steps.
Oh, but it's so easy.
You just move.
- No, wait.
- What?
There.
Oh, I love a man with a moustache.
Pull in your claws, kitty cat.
He's mine.
Kitty cat?
Genuine alley.
You see, last year Hagatha gave the party.
And I'll never forget the appetizers she served.
Boiled tree fungus with peppered fish fat and sea urchins with bordelaise sauce.
I'm afraid we'll have to move back a bit.
Eva is insisting on doing her little thing again.
Please.
And the second course was boiled ostrich with sweet and sour sauce turtledove sautéed in its own feathers roast parrot, and dormice stuffed with pork and pine kernels.
- What's going to happen?
- Eva's going to dance.
Again.
It's her own creation.
She calls it the Pussyfoot.
Now, I thought you'd like that.
Honey, anything's an improvement on listening to Uncle Arthur.
By the way, where's the music coming from?
Oh, we have our own special hook-up.
Ghost-to-ghost.
That's cute, Sammy.
Sorry.
I forgot to tell you about the salad.
Oak leaves and moss Spanish moss, I think.
- With neat's-foot oil and vinegar.
- Really?
- And finally for dessert flamingo flambé with fricassee of forget-me-nots.
- How do you like that?
- Sounds delicious.
Delicious?
Why, it was revolting.
You weren't even listening to me, were you?
John, I tell you, this Kravitz woman is a triple-A kook.
Councilman, one thing you better learn about American politics is that kooks vote.
- Councilman Green.
- Mrs. Kravitz, how nice to see you.
This is Mr. Morgan, my campaign manager.
Wait till you see what's going on across the street.
Mrs. Kravitz, if there is Councilman, in case there is something going on don't you think we ought to arrange for some documentation?
- Documentation?
- We're going across the street.
Call this number.
When the man answers tell him to stand by for a call from Councilman Green.
- Who'd you have her call?
- The Morning Globe.
- You want headlines or not?
- Good thinking.
Excuse us just a second.
- Some hors d'oeuvres from Perugia.
- Hey, Sam.
Say, hey, Willie.
- How you doing?
- Fine.
Just fine.
- Sam, Sam.
Isn't that Willie Mays?
- Of course.
- She's my favourite.
- She's her mother's daughter.
- What's he doing here?
- Oh, Darrin, really.
You mean, he's a Too?
The way he hits home runs, what else?
- Sam.
- Oh, excuse me, sweetheart.
Gee, I think it's about time for me to pop out to the ballpark.
He sure is.
Well, hello.
You've been ignoring me all evening.
Well, not intentionally, I'm sure.
There must be something I should be doing.
This party's being given in my own house, you know.
Oh, why, that's fascinating.
Tell me more.
And while you're at it, you can scratch me behind the ears.
Did you see that?
No.
If you know what's good for you, neither did you.
- Expecting some late arrivals?
- No, but we may have some anyway.
See that man?
I think that's our councilman.
- What's he doing here?
- I don't know.
Probably some of Gladys Kravitz's handiwork.
I don't care what you say, I want to know what's going on in that house.
It is.
He and his friend are coming to the front door.
- What will we do?
- We do nothing.
Party crashers are my specialty.
That should take care of that.
This is the thinnest house I've ever been through.
We found a shortcut through the house.
Now all we have to do is find the house.
Eva.
Eva, please, I'm a married man.
I know.
Well, I better take care of that.
That's what makes you so interesting.
Well, Eva Rats.
Exactly.
Go chase a few.
Sam, did you?
Didn't have to.
At midnight it happens automatically.
- Sammy, come here.
- Oh, excuse me.
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
I got rid of them once.
Persistent little devils, aren't they?
Morgan, there's more to this house than meets the eye.
There's less to this house than meets the eye.
Come on, let's try the window.
Come on, John.
Let's get out of here.
We always did make a good team.
John, I've been handling the problems of this community year after year and I suggest we handle the problems of this house the same way I've handled all the other problems of this community.
I suggest that I won't say anything about it if you don't.
Good thinking.
Everybody.
Everybody, quiet.
Quiet, please.
What's Endora up to now?
I'm afraid she's about to start her recitation.
Oh, no.
Are you gonna let her ruin your party?
- My party?
- Well, it's your house.
You want everybody to leave?
- Is that what they'd do?
- Now stop it, you two.
We'll just have to grin and bear it.
Come on.
Thank you, thank you.
Needless to say, I wouldn't dream of doing any of my own selections if some of you hadn't insisted.
Now, what would some of you insisters like me to do first, huh?
Sing "Melancholy Baby".
Endora, apologize.
No apologies needed for you, Boris.
My first selection will be, "'Twas the Night Before Halloween".
'Twas the night before Halloween And all who were chic Were sipping champagne They'd been stoned for a week.
The witches and warlocks In Rome by the score With their ladies attired In their best by Dior Checking their warts as they came through the door.
And the odd little mortals All snug in their beds While visions of trick or treat Danced in their heads Our children were practicing spells And their chance And even the poltergeists pulled off their pants.
I've had it.
Did you hear what I said, Arthur?
I've had it.
I guess that will dampen your spirits.
Come on, everybody.
Let's take our party somewhere else.
The Riviera?
Venice, anyone?
You gotta say one thing for her, she's got imagination.
Well, I warned you, Uncle Arthur.
Thank you, Sammy.
Let's put it this way: It was the most unusual Halloween party I've ever been to.
It sure beats dunking for apples.
Well, I think it was Mother's most unusual Halloween party too.
You know something, Darrin?
Among other things, you're an awfully good sport.
No, it's true.
Not many men would go through what you have and still keep smiling.
- That's true.
- Darrin.
Well, I To show my appreciation for you letting us have the party here I promise that next year we'll spend Halloween with your family.
- Thanks.
- And Thanksgiving with mine.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Louise, I don't wanna hear about it.
I'm not interested.
I don't Really?
What?
Who?
They didn't.
- They did?
- Sam?
The Camdens had a fight and he left the house?
- Sam?
- When?
Last night.
And he took all the wedding presents?
Sam!
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
- Breakfast will be ready in a minute.
- You said that 20 minutes ago.
Louise, I'll call you back.
I can't talk now.
Honey, you know how I hate gossip.
Darrin, I wouldn't even listen to anything about anyone unless it was good.
And, boy, was that good.
- Samantha!
- Okay, Darrin.
I'll get it.
It's diaper day.
Diaper Dan at your service.
Hi, Mrs. Stephens.
- Just put it down anywhere, Dan.
- Ma'am.
Say, you know, Mrs. Stephens your husband being in the advertising business gave me an idea.
Here.
I thought it up myself.
"Compliments of Diaper Dan".
Oh, isn't that cute?
Oh, no.
You keep the rattle.
I want your baby to have the first one on the block.
Well, thank you, Dan.
That's very sweet of you.
Well, I gotta be going.
Did you happen to see the moving van in front of the Kirkeby's?
- The Kirkeby's are moving?
- Not only that.
Wait till you hear why.
The fountain of trivia runneth over.
Dan, I'm not interested.
Well, it's just that Harry Mr. Kirkeby and his secretary, you know, that gorgeous blond How gauche.
Well, maybe just a word or two.
Sam, for heaven's sakes.
Dan?
Yeah, well, I really have to be going.
So long, Mrs. Stephens.
Sam, can't you understand that loose talk can be a dangerous thing?
All right, all right, Darrin.
You're right.
Even Mother agrees with you.
Up to a point.
It's not that I'm opposed to gossip, you understand.
It's this banal, mundane type that bores me.
Darrin, I was not gossiping.
I was listening.
Besides, who's going to know what's been said here today?
That's what Lincoln said in his Gettysburg Address.
How you can even listen to him is beyond me.
But, darling, Dan meant no harm.
Dan has got a big mouth.
Hello, this is Dragonfly calling Mother Hubbard.
Dragonfly calling Mother Hubbard.
Over.
Mother Hubbard calling Dragonfly.
We read you.
Go ahead.
Well, it worked.
I planted a mike in the baby's rattle.
Everything's coming in loud and clear.
Good work.
Report in as soon as you can.
Over.
Roger and out.
Hello, Louise.
Oh, I just had a hunch it was you.
Yes, Darrin's left.
Oh, well, we had a few words, but everything's all right now.
Yes, it's because he's been working so hard on that Wright campaign but he's come up with wonderful ideas.
The only good idea he ever had was marrying you, I regret to say.
Mother.
Oh, yes, I'm sure Larry's going to love them.
Well, he thought of a marvellous slogan.
"The Wright pen is the write pen for you".
"Wright".
Like in W-R-l-G-H-T.
And "write" lik e in W-R-l-T-E.
Clever, huh?
Lik e in W-R-l-G-H-T.
And "write," lik e in W-R-l-T-E.
- Clever, huh?
- I'll say it is!
Peterson, get right on it.
Use everything that's on that tape.
Yes, sir, Mr. Kimberly.
I'll pull that Wright account right out from under McMann & Tate.
What I wouldn't give to see Larry Tate's face when he makes his presentation.
What do you mean you've already seen this?
We just finished it last night.
Isn't that true, Darrin?
Yes.
Mr. Wright, we've spent a great deal of time and thought on this.
- We think it's very good.
- Oh, it's good.
But as I said, I saw practically the same thing at the Kimberly office.
At least you could be more original.
More original?
More original.
Nobody's more original than McMann & Tate.
- Furthermore, Mr - Steady, Larry, steady.
Now, Mr. Wright, before you make any decisions we'll get started on another presentation right away.
- Fair enough?
- Fair enough.
I'll give you 24 hours.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I can't understand it.
How could Kimberly come up with the same idea?
Well, it happens, Larry, it happens.
We'll just have to chalk it up to coincidence.
Don't look now, but guess who just came in.
- Who?
- Kimberly.
Maybe if we ignore him, he'll crawl away.
Well, Tate and Stephens.
This is a coincidence.
I was just saying the same thing, A.J. Were you, now?
How's business, Tate?
Oh, make a million, lose a million.
I just heard about your tough luck with the Wright account.
Well, you can't win them all.
- So who says we lost it?
- Well, I just took it for granted.
We'll think of something, A.J. I'm sure you will, Stephens.
Just as long as we don't think of it first.
Mr. Kimberly, I believe our table's ready, sir.
Well, see you in the rat race, boys.
- And there goes King Rat.
- You don't trust Kimberly?
I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw an elephant.
An elephant.
Larry, that's it!
I've got an idea for a new presentation.
I'll see you back at the office.
It's just one of those things, honey, a coincidence.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
You mean you lost the account?
Not yet.
Your old Darrin's still in there pitching.
But I will be working late tonight.
I've got this great idea about an elephant and a whole new slogan.
"An elephant never forgets.
But if you do write it down with the Wright pen and you'll always remember".
Oh, that's marvellous!
Bye, darling.
Reach for it.
There!
Oh, you want the crackers!
Well, hex it over for Grandmama.
There.
That's a good girl.
- Mother.
- Now what?
Don't encourage her.
Tabatha mustn't twitch.
If Darrin ever catches you, he'll be furious.
He'll never catch me.
Besides, the way your husband works nights I have this peculiar feeling you're married to a night watchman.
It's an emergency, Mother.
Darrin's working on a simply marvellous new idea.
- Isn't he always?
- Naturally.
But this one's a gas.
A g A what?
Oh, that's advertising talk for sensational.
I want a rattle.
- There you are.
- I probably shouldn't mention it.
But it really is brilliant.
Darrin has an idea about using an elephant and a slogan that goes: "An elephant never forgets.
If you do, write it down with a Wright pen and you'll always remember".
- And you'll always remember.
- How about that?
- Great!
Yeah, I liked it.
Peterson, rush it to the Art Department, then over to Wright.
Yes, sir.
What?
You couldn't possibly have already seen these!
But I have, Mr. Tate, just an hour ago.
Gentlemen, your lack of inventiveness leaves me no alternative but to take my account elsewhere.
Mr. Wright.
Mr. Wright.
We realize presentations can be coincidental.
It's one of those things.
But we'll come up with the winner, I promise you.
Well, I'll have to make a decision soon.
Well, thank you, Mr. Wright.
You won't be sorry.
Larry!
Larry, take it easy.
Take it easy.
I tell you, there's a spy in this company.
Come on, Larry.
You've been seeing too many movies.
Well, once can be a coincidence.
I'll buy that.
But twice?
Never.
I hate to admit it, but you may be right.
I know I'm right.
Larry.
Lar Larry, what are you doing?
I'm looking for a hidden microphone.
Your office must be bugged.
What's this?
So you put it in here, huh, you little rascal?
What's this?
Larry, this is a job for professionals.
If there is a mike planted in here, we'll never find it.
You're right.
I'll get security up here at once.
I'll have every lock replaced and the combination of the safe changed.
I'll get to the bottom of this if I have to give a lie-detector test to everybody in the firm.
Including myself.
And you.
Thank you.
- Larry, is this really necessary?
- Absolutely.
Now, this final presentation is top-secret.
I don't want you to even talk to Sam about it.
That's an order.
Yes, sir.
You know, Larry, I was thinking What's the matter?
The olive.
- The olive?
- The olive.
It may be bugged.
A mike?
A pimento.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Hi, darling.
Still here, huh?
Well, I certainly wouldn't leave without waiting for Mr. Charm to come home.
Oh, now, now, Mother.
Sweetheart, you look tired.
You sit down and unwind.
Dinner will be ready in a little while.
- Honey, hold it!
Hold it.
- What in the world?
Larry's idea.
I've got the key here somewhere.
Really, Durwood.
Aren't you carrying this ridiculous cloak-and-dagger business too far?
"Ridiculous"?
Two of my best ideas stolen and she calls it ridiculous.
We checked the office, everything.
Of course.
There's a bug in this house.
I beg your pardon!
Oh, Mother, Darrin wasn't referring to you, were you?
- Were you?
- No, honey, a bug.
A hidden microphone.
It could be hidden anywhere.
In a lamp, under the table.
Have you discussed the Wright campaign with anyone?
- No.
Only Mother.
- Well, I wouldn't repeat that drivel.
And Louise on the phone.
The phone?
That's it.
They've tapped the phone.
Honey, from now on, stay away from that phone.
- You're not to talk to anybody.
- Now, wait just a minute, Darrin.
Because I casually mention your campaign to my mother and your boss's wife Are you trying to blame me for your troubles?
Confiding in a woman is like broadcasting by Telstar.
Well, then you shouldn't have told me in the first place.
- You shouldn't have listened to me!
- You don't have to shout.
- I'm not shouting!
- Perhaps you'd prefer it if I didn't speak to you at all.
- That would suit me just fine and that would be like declaring a global news blackout.
I have a good mind to go home to Mother!
What for?
Your mother's always here!
I'm telling you, chief, they're not even speaking to each other.
Over.
Well, don't just sit there on your diapers.
Do something.
Over.
Leave it to me.
Roger and out.
Mother, look.
Aren't they gorgeous?
Let's see.
"From Darrin, with all his trust and love".
- Oh, Mother, isn't he wonderful?
- I was afraid he'd chicken out.
"To Darrin.
With love, Samantha".
What a sweetheart.
All right, you can take your new rattle to bed with you.
Here you go.
Now, come on, turn around.
Let me get this button fastened.
There.
Pretty bow.
Pretty bow and the kitty cats - Hi, honey.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hello, darling.
- You look tired.
I've still got a lot more work to do on the Wright presentation.
But first Oh, Darrin, more roses.
My, you certainly are extravagant but sweet.
I like the tie you sent me.
- What do you mean, "more roses"?
- Why, these.
- I didn't send you any tie.
- You didn't?
Oh, wait a minute.
Mother sent us each a present to patch up our quarrel.
Endora?
Are you kidding?
Well, sometimes she does what you don't expect just to keep you from thinking you know what to expect from her.
Come to think of it, she did agree with me the other morning.
That's a switch.
See what I mean?
Mother's a switchy witch.
This is it.
The meeting's at 10:00.
There better not be another coincidence.
I'll keep my fingers crossed.
Let me know how it went?
I sure will.
Bye.
- Sweetheart, what about those?
- Those are rough preliminary sketches.
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.
- Good morning, Samantha.
- Good morning, Mother.
More roses from lover-boy?
The red ones are from him.
Mother, he came up with the most marvellous idea for the campaign.
He was up all night working, but it was worth it.
Everything's gonna turn out just perfectly.
Naturally.
Here in Happiness House, it wouldn't dare work out another way.
- Pooh.
- Pooh?
Have you sunk to that level of repartee?
There.
Pretty?
What do you mean, "the red roses are from him"?
Now, Mother, go ahead, admit it.
You know you sent the others.
L I sent them?
And Darrin wants me to thank you for the necktie.
Oh, how utterly preposterous!
Not that I wouldn't like to give Durwood a necktie.
- Oh, very funny.
- Sweet, isn't it?
Oh, Mother, wait a minute.
If you didn't send them, who did?
I haven't the faintest idea.
And what's more, I couldn't possibly care less.
Well, I care.
Pat Paterson Paterson Florist.
Information, could I have the number for the Paterson Florist, please?
This is what she calls brilliant?
He gets paid for this?
Are you sure there isn't some mistake?
Well, there's no reason in the world for him to send Well, you see he's our You're positive?
All right, thank you.
Thank you very much.
Diaper Dan?
Diaper Dan.
Diaper Dan?
Since I merely possess supernatural powers of the highest degree perhaps I'm not expected to understand.
Would you mind telling me what is so brilliant about an astronaut in an ad?
Or this nauseating slogan, "When you fly to the moon you'll still be writing with the Wright pen for there's only one right way to go into space and only one right way to write"?
- Mercy!
Of all the idiotic things - Mother, listen.
Mother.
What?
Of course!
But of course what?
Oh, how stupid!
Stupid, stupid, stupid!
Well, that's what I was just saying about these scribblings.
- Mother?
- What?
Remember what Darrin said about a bug in the house, that it could be hidden anywhere?
Mother, there it is.
There's the bug.
There goes Diaper Dan.
And thanks to you there goes another one of Darrin's ideas.
Oh, splendid, Samantha!
Wait till you see this one.
Out of the mouths of babes.
Something wrong, Dan?
I lost my engine.
Who said that?
I did, Dan.
I did.
Can I help?
- May I, Samantha?
- Be my guest.
Smashing, Mother.
Oh, well.
- Oh, my!
Goodness me.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
Well.
You certainly are in a good mood this morning.
Couldn't be better.
Coffee's good, paper's here.
I have a beautiful wife and a satisfied client.
- You couldn't miss.
The presentation was sensational.
I caught a glimpse of it.
You saw it?
And you thought I couldn't keep a secret.
Well, what do you know?
I'll get it.
Good morning, Mrs. Stephens.
Good morning, Dan.
You can just put it right over there.
Thank you.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, there'll be a "drew niver" stopping by for a I mean, a new driver stopping by for a while.
He's going on I mean, I'm going on vacation.
How nice.
Have a good time.
Good time?
I'm spending a month at The Country Air Rest Home.
Did Dan say he was going to a rest home?
Yes, dear.
Well, he did seem a little confused.
You might even say he was rattled.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
- You ready yet, honey?
- I'll be right down.
Good.
That'll give me another 10 minutes.
Hook this for me, will you, honey?
- Sam.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- There you go.
- Thanks.
How did you manage that when you were single?
Oh, I had to use witchcraft.
It was much more dependable, but not nearly as much fun.
Honey, I'm sorry this turned into a business dinner but Larry's dying to land this account.
Mr. MacElroy's leaving town tonight.
- Have I met him?
- No, but you've been in his shoes.
MacElroy Shoes.
One of the biggest in the country.
Shoes for the whole family.
And I don't mind saying myself l've come up with some pretty big ideas.
Dear, what you need is some smaller ideas, or a bigger tube.
The baby sitter isn't here yet anyway.
By the way, who is it?
- Who?
- The sitter.
Oh, Sam, you didn't.
Well, Darrin, Aunt Clara volunteered and I couldn't say no without hurting her feelings.
Besides, we have to be extra-specially nice to her right now.
- She's just had a big disappointment.
- She flunked the national driver's test?
Darrin, don't be ridiculous.
Aunt Clara can barely fly, let alone drive.
No.
She's just broken up with Ocky.
- Ocky?
- Octavius.
He's a warlock she used to be very fond of.
But then the old fool met a young witch, and Well, you know the rest.
It's an old story.
Oh, sure, happens every day.
Old warlock runs off with a pretty young witch.
Poor old girl.
As if she didn't have enough trouble.
Okay, she can sit.
But that's all, understand?
Yes, darling, I'll tell her.
Aunt Clara, we've got a front door, you know.
I must have let my flaps down too soon.
Good night, dear Aunt Clara, and try to cheer up, huh?
Yeah, maybe he'll come back.
- Who?
- Octavius.
No, I've forgotten him completely.
That's good, dear.
- I bear him no grudge.
- We won't be too late.
And he's free to do whatever he wants.
- Good night, Aunt Clara.
- Night.
After all, he is over 21.
Boy, is he over.
Still awake, precious?
Aunt Clara will sing you a little lullaby.
Lullaby Lullaby Lullaby Lullaby and good night Oh, I wish I wish this were nearer the nursery.
It worked.
Well, you've still got it, old girl.
Mommy.
Oh, dear.
Oh, what's happening?
Oh, stop that.
Now, that's no way for a piano to behave.
Oh, I must do something fast.
Piano, piano, that I prize Return to that convenient size Anybody Oh, Mrs. Kravitz.
So nice of you to drop in.
How'd that piano get up there?
What piano?
We got out of that one.
Now, let's get out of this one.
Just wait till you see some of Stephens' layouts for MacElroy Shoes.
Fresh, original, inventive.
Naturally, Mr. Tate made a strong contribution too.
Oh, thank you, Darrin.
That's not only very generous of you but if you hadn't said it, I'd have fired you.
About the layouts, Mr. MacElroy?
I'll be glad to look at them after dinner, if there's time.
Can't miss that plane, you know.
- Delicious roast, Louise.
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, are you finished already?
- I am too.
Me too.
Aren't you, dear?
Oh, yes, yes.
Mr. MacElroy's through too.
Oh, Louise, I can't wait to see what you have for dessert.
Oh, you'll love it.
It's fattening, but you'll love it.
O piano black as night How I wish that you were light What happened?
Oh, it's just probably a power failure or something.
No problem.
Keep going, keep going.
Mr. MacElroy, we'd like to present some ideas for a new slogan.
Thank you, honey.
- Try this on for size.
- Don't like it.
I haven't mentioned it yet.
Maybe we better postpone this until I come back to town.
No, we'll get more candles.
Louise, more candles?
Forget the candles.
How about some more brandy?
Louise, more brandy, more brandy.
Here you are, back where you belong.
And I did it.
I certainly don't know how.
How should we get the lights back on?
Oh, dear.
Now, if that's Darrin and Samantha l'm through as a sitter.
A sitter?
I'm through as an aunt.
- Good evening.
- Hello.
We just wanted to find out if everything was all right over here.
Oh, everything's fine.
I've been watching television.
- With no electricity?
- Oh, you noticed that.
- Have you got a flashlight in the house?
- Well, I really don't know.
Well, here, take this.
We have extras.
Are your lights out too?
Oh, for the love of Pete.
The whole Eastern Seaboard is blacked out.
It is?
What caused it?
They don't know yet.
Well, I hope they never find out.
Excuse me a minute.
- Come on, Gladys.
- Good night.
Hi, Aunt Clara.
Is everything all right?
Oh, of course, of course.
Why shouldn't it be?
Aren't the lights out?
They are everywhere else.
Oh, yes.
The lights are out here too.
Well, what a coincidence.
Well, I doubt if that's what the electric company's calling it.
How's Tabatha?
She's sleeping peacefully.
Well, that's good.
I'll check later.
Aunt Clara, you sure everything's all right?
Oh, everything's fine.
But everything's fine.
Bye-bye.
Putting the lights out in 12 states.
Could've happened to anybody.
But how am I gonna get them back on again?
Oh, I've got to have help.
Oh, I wish Ocky were here.
Maybe I could bring him here.
I can try.
Eyes lik e fishes Nose lik e dishes - Ocky.
- Clara.
It worked.
Well, it worked.
Oh, I still have my touch.
- Clara, my darling.
- Oh, no.
Nothing like that.
No, I called you back professionally.
And then after that you can go back to your little witch.
Clara, I don't want her.
I want to come back to you.
Do you?
- You know what she did to me?
- What did she do?
The little gold digger, "Give me this.
Give me that".
Grab, grab, grab.
I must've blown a year's magic on her.
I never want to see her again.
Oh, dear.
And then she's so pretty and so young and You're just as pretty as she is.
Oh, no Oh, no, Ocky.
No, no.
Will you please take me back?
Well, maybe I will and maybe I won't.
But now I need help.
I've just put out all the lights along the Eastern Seaboard.
- Purposely?
- On mistake.
I'll say this, when you make one, it's a beaut.
Let's see, now.
This isn't going to be easy.
Okay.
Let's have a whirl at it.
Eastern Seaboard - Ocky, you did it.
- Yeah.
How about that?
What happened?
Well, do it again, do it again.
- Now, put a little more zing into it.
- Okay.
- Your hands.
It's your hands, Ocky.
- Are they gone?
Oh, no.
No, but you must keep them up to keep the lights on.
Swell.
Abner, you said the lights were out all over.
That's right, all over the East.
So how come they're on across the street?
Don't be ridiculous.
They can't be.
No?
Come see for yourself.
Have you got that buzzing in your head again?
Take a look.
Ocky, did you put your hands down?
I had an itch.
Do you mind?
The lights are on across the street, huh?
- They were.
- You'll be all right, dear.
As soon as the swelling goes down.
Now they're on again.
It's dangerous to stand by the window.
Somebody might throw a rock at you.
Who would do a thing like that?
Me, if you don't sit down and shut up.
Now, here's a slogan you're gonna like a lot more than the others, Mr. MacElroy.
"There's no business like shoe business".
So much for slogans.
Hi, there, Aunt Clara.
Just checking.
You all right?
Good.
How's Tabatha?
Oh, fine.
She's sleeping peacefully, like a baby.
How are you doing without lights?
Oh, we have lights now.
But the radio said the whole city was blacked out.
How could you possibly have lights?
Well, I don't know.
I'm a witch, not an electrician.
Aunt Clara, I don't understand.
How could you have light unless you - Now, listen - You have lights at your place?
- Why, yes.
- Well, great.
Let's jump in the car and go over there before this deal goes down the drain.
Hello?
We'll be right there.
But But But I'm not calling to complain about my lights being out.
I just wanna ask a simple question.
How come the lights are on across the street?
I am not a crank, and if you don't believe me you can check for yourself.
Oh, my niece is coming.
Oh, dear.
Well, I'd rather she didn't see you.
I'd rather she didn't see me either.
Do you mind stepping in here in the closet?
You know Do you?
Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up, Ocky.
- Hi, Aunt Clara.
- I really should leave for the airport.
- We'll see that you get downtown.
- Absolutely.
Aunt Clara, don't you have something you'd like to tell me?
Tell?
Well Now, l I do, but I had a feeling you'd say that.
- I'm gonna go up and check Tabatha.
- Yes, well, take your time, dear.
And another thing.
We think you ought to be using TV.
Darrin, tell him about the spectacular you dreamt up.
- It's a beaut.
- What I had in mind was a big shoe.
Yes, we based the whole thing on "The Old Woman Who Lived in a Shoe".
And we have some marvellous songs.
- "Shoo-Shoo Baby"?
- "Body and Soul"?
"Buttons and Bows"?
- For ladies' shoes.
- Got any brandy?
Somebody, a brandy for Mr. MacElroy.
Darrin, show him the newspaper layout.
You wanna see some really clever copy?
- Yes.
- Just wait.
Where's the brandy?
Yes, the brandy.
Mr. MacElroy, we thought we'd start out with Oh, no, not again.
There's a flashlight right there on the table, Larry.
Gentlemen, I really should be leaving.
No, you can't leave before you see this ad.
See?
I can't see anything.
That was just a little dance I learned in Scotland.
It's called, "The Wee Kick of the Kirk".
Bet she knows where the brandy is.
Now what?
Never mind, Darrin, I'll get it.
- Yes?
- Power company.
We got a complaint about Your lights are on.
How about that?
Come on, fellas.
- Now, just a minute.
- We'll have them out in no time.
- What?
- I mean, we'll get it fixed.
Find the trouble, check it out.
Darrin, will you get rid of them?
Now, just a minute.
My husband's in the middle of something very important.
Everybody in the city was in the middle of something important but I only got two hands.
Fellas, you check the fuse box and I'll go check the wiring in the kitchen.
Aunt Clara, you just wait till I get you alone.
- I didn't - You have some explaining to do.
Now, wait a minute.
I've got a problem here.
I've got a very important client here.
We can use all the light we can get.
- Look, I've got to get to the airport.
- No, no, wait.
No, Mr. MacElroy, wait.
You've got plenty of time, plenty.
Darrin!
Will you forget about him, Darrin?
All right, I'll get my own brandy.
Oh, sorry for all these interruptions, Mr. MacElroy.
I see you got your brandy.
Come on over here and sit down.
Aunt Clara, there's something funny going on around here.
Oh, I wish you'd tell me.
I'm dying to have a good laugh.
- What was that?
- Oh, I've got to get out of here.
Now, wait, Mr. MacElroy.
Mrs. Kravitz, what are you doing here?
Never mind me.
What are you doing here?
- Me?
- Mrs. Kravitz, what is the matter?
There's something in that closet.
What is it?
I thought it was a moth, but it moved.
- That's ridiculous.
- That's ridiculous.
Take a look.
All right.
Wait.
Look, Mrs. Kravitz.
There's no one in the closet.
Saved your Sunday punch for the last, right?
- What?
- Now, that's what I call a clever idea.
Animated shoes.
It's only great.
Animated shoes?
What kind of voices did you have in mind for the shoes?
Voices?
Yeah, voices.
Come on back, and let's talk about it.
What about his plane?
- Darrin.
- You must be joshing.
I'm not leaving town till I hear all about this.
- What are the details?
- Yes, let's hear the details.
The details.
Let me have some of that brandy.
We're gonna check the power lines on the outside.
Just be patient.
We'll get to the bottom of this yet.
I certainly hope so.
- What happened?
- She fainted.
Good, now I can get some sleep.
Love the fainting lady.
How do you work her into the animated shoes?
Aunt Clara, what have you done?
About what?
Oh, my stars.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Oh, hi.
- How you feel?
- Like a million.
Which is just about what MacElroy's account is worth.
Don't forget you owe it all to Aunt Clara's irresponsibility.
They talked to a puppet man, said it'll be a cinch to animate those shoes.
Really?
You know, it's amazing what human beings can do.
Listen to this.
"Power company officials announced that last night's massive blackout was due to a power reversal.
The sudden surge in the Niagara grid compounded by the failure of an automatic cut-off system was a one-in-a-million accident".
Aunt Clara didn't do it.
- Where are you going?
- To tell her.
Oh, but, Darrin, she thinks she did it.
She's even kind of proud of herself.
Aunt Clara's a new woman.
I don't get it.
Will it hurt to let her go on thinking she's responsible?
She's bound to read about it in the papers.
So what?
The newspapers are always coming up with logical explanations for things we witches do.
- She won't pay any attention to it.
- It's okay with me.
And who knows, maybe she did do it.
Well, the failure of an automatic cut-off system that was a one-in-a-million accident or one of Aunt Clara's goof-ups.
Now, which is harder to believe?
I'd give anything if you hadn't asked.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
The babysitter said 10:00, Louise, but she's usually late so why don't we make it 10:30?
Sam, where's my houndstooth sport coat?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Fine, I'll tell him.
- See you later.
- My houndstooth sport coat - Louise and I are going shopping.
- Where's my houndstooth?
Larry's car broke down, so she's gonna drop him off and then pick me up.
I'm late for work, and I don't have time to listen to an itinerary of where you're going.
Have you seen my houndstooth sport coat?
- Which one is that?
- The tweedy one.
Black and orange checks?
- The one you hate?
- Oh, that one.
- You don't wear that anymore.
- I'd wear it today, but I can't find it.
To the office?
Well, don't you think it's a little noisy?
Sam, this may surprise you, but I've chosen my own clothes for some time.
Why don't you wear the brown one?
It's nicer.
I want to wear the houndstooth, and I can't find it!
Now, have you seen it or not?
- You're shouting.
- Do you know where it is or not?
I gave it away.
You gave it away?
Well, I was cleaning out your closets and just gave away everything you don't wear.
You gave it away.
Stop saying, "You gave it away," like I sold your mother into slavery.
That coat must have been Fifteen!
That's just the point!
It has tradition and character!
And patches on the sleeves, and moth holes, and a tear in the pocket.
- Who'd you give it to?
- The thrift shop.
Maybe they still have it.
Darrin, that was a month ago.
Darrin?
Don't you think you ought to put on a coat?
You're not wearing one.
Thank you.
Hereafter, however I would appreciate it if you didn't touch my clothes.
I know I know I shouldn't have lost my temper.
But to give away my sport coat!
How could she do such a thing?
Take it easy, Darrin.
Relax and start from the beginning.
Why don't you have a seat?
- You see she - No, no, not there.
On the couch.
It's easier to talk when you're reclining.
Where did you do your residency, doctor?
Now, look, buddy boy, let's not try to get funny.
I have much more experience in these matters than you have.
Firstly, I've been married longer.
And secondly, Louise and I have been seeing a psychiatrist for months.
Psychiatrist.
So that's how you come by your couch-side manner.
Oh, come on, Darrin, this is serious.
Dr. Kramer's changed our lives.
And he specializes in exactly your problem.
I don't have any problem.
I just don't have a houndstooth sport coat.
The coat isn't important.
Not important?
That was my favourite coat.
What matters is that it caused you and Sam to have a fight.
Now, Dr. Kramer's specialty is teaching married couples how to fight.
According to Dr. Kramer's theory, there are three kinds of fights the amphigoric, the semi-amphigoric, and the centripetal.
That's a great system, Larry.
It'd be impossible to fight because nobody knows what the words mean.
It's really very simple, Darrin.
The amphigoric fight is, well, silly and irrational and, according to Dr. Kramer, should be avoided entirely.
The semi-amphigoric is your everyday, garden-variety fight.
Which, on deeper analysis can be revealed to be either amphigoric proper or centripetal.
That is significant.
If it falls into the first type, it should be stopped immediately.
But, if it should turn out to be centripetal it should be fought through to a conclusion.
What type is my houndstooth sport coat?
To you, it was just an ugly old coat, right?
- Right.
- Well, what we have to determine is what did that houndstooth sport jacket represent to Darrin?
Bad taste?
Too simple.
According to Dr. Kramer the way a husband and wife feels about how his spouse dresses shows the condition of the entire relationship.
How does Darrin like to see you dress?
Oh, bright colours, chic lines.
Good, good, good.
That means he still thinks of you romantically, as a lover.
Well, I hope so.
If he'd like for you to wear drab clothes You know, dull colours and those sensible shoes.
- Well, that would mean he was just beginning to take you for granted.
That sounds logical.
But what about the houndstooth jacket?
Now, why was I wrong to get rid of it?
Oh, now, that's the other side of the coin.
To Darrin, that jacket must have represented his desire to be attractive and alluring to you.
And by giving it away, you indicated you were just taking him for granted.
The doctor doesn't help you solve problems.
He just shows you how to analyse them.
For example, how does Sam like you to dress?
Well, conservative clothes, dark suits, quiet colours.
Exactly, married clothes.
And you come along with a sport coat with black and orange checks.
Now, if she really liked that coat, you'd be in real trouble.
Yeah.
Why?
Because it would indicate that she's not completely satisfied with married life.
That she yearns to be gay, single, and carefree herself.
You see?
Your argument turned out to be amphigoric after all.
She was just showing you how much she loved you by giving away that coat.
Larry, I have to admit that Dr. Kramer seems to really know his stuff.
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm going to buy a present at lunch to show Sam how wrong I was.
Good idea.
You're showing great psychological insight.
But remember, Darrin, when you buy Sam that gift a husband's present to his wife expresses how he feels about her.
I don't know why I let you talk me out of going back to get Darrin's old coat.
That's the one he loves, and the one he should have.
Will you forget it?
They'd never still have it and even if they do, we want something new.
- We do?
- Perhaps something in a Shetland?
They're very good this year.
No, I'm sorry.
Old or new, it has to be houndstooth.
With black and orange checks.
Well, if I may be permitted, madam we haven't carried houndstooth for many years.
Today's gentleman has grown a bit more sophisticated.
This is for yesterday's gentleman.
Well, perhaps, if you tried a costume shop.
Oh, no.
The baron usually gets his clothes tailored at the chateau.
But being so far from home, well Come, come, Louise.
Well, I guess I'd better go put more pennies in the parking meter.
You sure this is it?
Oh, yes.
I remember it quite well.
- We dyed it as soon as it came in.
- Why did you dye it?
If you're buying second-hand clothes you don't want to stand out in a crowd like a neon light.
All right, I'll take it.
How much?
It was your coat to begin with.
But for the repairs and the dye, $5.00.
- Is that all?
- Believe me it's more than we expected to get.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
This is ever so chic.
Sophia Loren wears one just like it in her latest picture.
Was she married or single in the picture?
When she wore it she was single, but she got married right after.
Let me show it to you in hot pink.
It's a knockout.
Just remember, when you buy that gift for Sam a husband's present to his wife expresses exactly what he feels about her.
But be careful.
In Sam's mind sensible, conservative clothes equal happiness and security.
Frilly clothes and exotic colours equal jealousy and dissatisfaction with married life.
Remember the houndstooth sport coat.
You see, in hot pink it absolutely exudes romance, gaiety, mystery.
Have you got anything that exudes a little less gaiety and mystery and a little more security and contentment?
But, sir, you asked to see negligees, not flannel pyjamas.
Maybe a bathrobe instead of a negligee.
Something comfortable.
Something like this, perhaps?
Well, would you say that was a married woman's robe?
Oh, yes.
Definitely married.
With children.
Perfect.
Wrap it up.
Sam, about this morning, I wanted you to know that Well, I brought you a little present.
Well, isn't that a coincidence?
It just so happens, I got a little something for you too.
Oh, you shouldn't have done that.
It was my fault.
- Oh, now, just open it.
- Okay.
- Oh, I love to get presents.
- So do I. My houndstooth sport jacket.
Oh, Darrin!
It's lovely.
It was very considerate of you to get this for me when I know how much you hate it.
Oh, I don't hate it.
I love it.
I just thought I hated it.
Now I know, it's just the kind of thing I want you to wear.
Aren't you gonna try on your robe?
No.
No, I think I'll wait a couple of decades.
I went to a great deal of trouble to find a present that would express exactly how I feel about our marriage.
And you bought me a prison gown!
And what does this express?
I'll tell you what this expresses!
A woman who is disappointed in married life.
A woman who wishes she was gay, carefree, and single again!
I'll have you know that I spent almost the whole day looking for a coat like that.
Then I went back to the thrift shop.
They'd dyed it and I twitched it back because I knew you wanted it.
You twitched it back!
That's more proof!
- More proof of what?
- That you wish you were single again.
That's ridiculous.
I thought you honestly wished to give up witchcraft.
I really did.
I thought you wanted to be a normal housewife.
Well, this shows me how wrong I was.
You really wish that you were a single, carefree, full-time witch again!
Well, I'd rather be a witch than a convict.
Rather be a?
Well, that settles it.
There is nothing more to discuss.
Darrin?
Don't you dare walk out on me!
You see?
Every time you have a problem that you can't handle or you get excited, you resort to witchcraft.
You know what that means psychologically.
There's nothing I can do about it, so just go ahead.
I am only human.
Don't twitch.
Don't twitch!
Don't Don't twitch!
- Darrin?
- Please, please don't twitch, please.
- Darrin, wake up.
- Don't, don't, don't!
Wait!
It's okay, old buddy.
I'm not twitching.
Oh, hi, Larry.
You been here all night?
Oh, was I wrong.
Was I ever wrong!
Sam and I had one of the worst fights we ever had.
Wow.
You two certainly aren't ready to handle a centripetal kind of fight.
Darrin, you need expert advice.
Oh, Larry.
No, Larry.
As of now, the doctor-patient relationship between you and me is over.
Well, not me.
Dr. Kramer.
Let me call him and arrange for you and Sam to see him.
She'd never agree.
She won't even talk to me much less a psychiatrist.
I'll tell you what.
I'll have him come over here and pick you up.
Then you can both go over to your place and see Sam.
A doctor who makes house calls?
He sounds a little old-fashioned to me.
Don't worry, you'll love him.
He's a wizard.
Wizards I don't need.
He bought you this?
Oh, it's just like Duncan.
You get Tabatha ready, and I'll pack your things.
You certainly aren't gonna stay any longer in a house with a man who bought that as a present for his wife.
Mother, I'm not leaving just because we had a fight, so you can forget it.
Think I ought to call him and apologise?
Certainly not!
Not even mortal housewives do that.
Louise.
Louise Tate.
I'll call her and get the name of that psychiatrist.
He's the one that started the whole thing.
Psychiatrist?
Oh, Samantha, you wouldn't!
They're anti-witch!
What's so special about that?
So is everybody.
Yes, but they work at it.
They think we're figments of people's imagination.
- Mommy.
- Oh, dear.
There's Tabatha.
Would you see if she's all right while I make the phone call?
Yes, hello, darling.
How's Grandmamma's little witchlet, huh?
I wager you're hungry.
Come, Grandmamma's going to get you a bottle.
There.
Use your own power, Tabatha.
Mama isn't here.
There!
That's a girl!
That's a girl!
Oh, you were hungry.
Oh, a psychiatrist!
My own daughter.
Where did I go wrong?
Well, I always say, if you need a professional, get the best.
Libido Superego, id Do for me just what I bid Dr. Freud, I presume.
How do you do?
Won't you please step into my off Off Madame, these surroundings are unfamiliar to me.
Can you please tell me where I am, und how I got here?
For your own peace of mind, Dr. Freud, don't try to analyse it.
But this is not my office.
And I am not your patient.
It's my daughter.
Little girl.
Madame, you are very wise.
For the first time, someone has called me in time.
This is my granddaughter.
My daughter is downstairs.
Follow me.
Samantha, you can forget about that quack.
I have the real McCoy.
Do I have to lie down?
I feel silly.
Well, it is customary, but if you prefer, you may remain upright.
- Oh, thank you.
- Quit stalling, Samantha.
Tell Dr. Freud your problem.
Madam, if you interfere, I shall have to ask you to leave.
Now, your daughter will talk when she is ready.
Well, I'm a witch.
- Go on.
- Don't you think that's strange?
- Do you?
- No.
That's because I am one.
- How long have you been a witch?
- Ever since I was born.
I didn't know about it until I was a year old.
Right, Mother?
Nine months.
You were very precocious.
But that's not my problem.
You think you are a witch, but that is not your problem?
No, it's my husband.
- Is he a witch too?
- No, he's a mortal, like everyone else.
- That's his problem.
- Please.
Well, you see, it all started when Darrin That's my husband.
- Got mad because I gave away his favourite sport jacket.
That one.
- That is your husband's favourite coat?
- Unbelievable, isn't it?
Now, I friend of mine told me that that jacket represented Darrin's desire to be attractive and alluring to me and that I shouldn't have given it away.
Anyone who finds that jacket attractive and alluring to anyone is showing symptoms of a severely disorganized mind.
Well, if it doesn't mean that, what does it represent?
- Bad taste.
- I'll go with that.
Madam, if your daughter wishes to tell me why she thinks she is a witch then we will have to go into her dreams her childhood frustrations her relations with her mother.
Mother's a witch too.
Yeah.
Well That would be significant.
Because it's not a psychological problem.
Witch or not, you appear to be a sensible woman.
Now, sensible women don't fight with their husbands because the husband is partial to disagreeable sport coats.
That is silly.
In the future, when you fight, fight about important things.
Then you will not have to call upon me.
You sure you're a psychiatrist?
You'll receive my bill in a few days.
He's a psychiatrist.
Darrin!
Where have you been?
Sam, this is Dr. Matthew Kramer.
I thought that he might help us.
- How do you do?
- Mrs. Stephens.
- Is that yours?
- Yes, it is, but Why, it's beautiful!
Where did you get it?
I've been looking for a houndstooth sport jacket like this for years!
You see, it is not necessarily a psychiatric symptom.
There are many people with bad taste.
Bad taste?
This is a classic sport jacket, and I don't believe I've met you.
- My name is Dr. Sigmund - Sigmund!
Dr. Sigmund.
Well, Dr. Sigmund, what right do you have to suggest that I have bad taste?
I do not suggest.
I merely stated a fact.
That is the ugliest sport coat I've ever seen.
And in addition, doctor, you broke in on my patient.
Broke in on your Mr. Stephens, why didn't you tell me you had consulted another doctor?
I didn't know.
Is this what you call professional ethics?
Don't you lecture me on professional ethics!
I'll have you know that I've been a practising psychiatrist for many years.
Yes, doctor?
Well, I was a psychiatrist before there were psychiatrists!
I'll bet you were, phoney accent and all!
This looks like it'll be interesting.
How dare you insult my accent, you upstart!
- Doctors, please, please!
- Upstart?
Dr. Sigmund, I want to tell you something.
Guys like you give me a pain with your beards and your Old World manners.
I think you've all got father fixations.
- Father fixations?
- Yes!
- You take that back!
- You make me!
Oh, now, doctors, this is just a silly amphigoric argument.
You're not really gonna fight?
- Hold these.
- There isn't supposed to be violence.
You're supposed to watch out for the other's vulnerable areas.
I'll watch out for it!
I think this guy's got a glass jaw!
- Sam, do something.
- What can I do?
You might consider moving the furniture.
- Quick, before they hurt each other.
- You mean it?
I'll father fixation you.
It's guys like you who give the rest of us a bad name!
- Don't argue with me, honey!
Do it!
- All right, all right.
Mother, I'll take the big one.
Don't forget to make him forget.
- Where did he go?
- Sorry, doctor.
Back to the unconscious.
- Sam, I have to apologize.
- Darrin, I really feel so bad.
Oh, if you're going to kiss and make up, I'm going to leave.
It's nauseating.
- Darrin?
- What?
- I have an idea.
- What?
Let's kiss and make up.
Say, how did he get?
- Darrin?
- Yeah?
Close your eyes.
- What for?
- Go on, close them.
Okay.
- Closed?
- Can't see a thing.
- All right.
Now, stand up.
- With my eyes closed?
- Come on.
- Well, okay.
- Keep them closed, now.
- Yeah.
Put your arms behind you.
Now, other arm.
- Don't peek.
- I'm not.
There.
Okay?
Hey.
Hey, this is something else.
Where'd you get it?
I exchanged the houndstooth jacket for it.
Honey, you couldn't have exchanged it.
You Now, why did?
I exchanged the bathrobe too.
What were you gonna say?
I forgot.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Mrs. Dumont?
You shouldn't tempt me, Mrs. Stephens.
I've already had too many.
Well, just perhaps this one.
- They're delicious.
- More tea?
No, thank you.
I really must be running.
But you know l'm so glad you've agreed to serve on our Ways and Means committee.
You know, it's a good cause.
And the children really need that new playground equipment in the park.
Oh, I know.
And I'm looking forward to working with Mrs. Wheeler and Mrs. Albright.
- Oh, they're both such dears.
And you know they know just how to get into every piggy bank in the community.
Will you be here tomorrow?
No, I'm afraid not, my dear.
I've got two other meetings.
Oh, Mrs. Dumont.
You do so much.
As Herkimer says it keeps me out of mischief.
But I'll try to drop by and see how you're getting along.
- Thank you.
- Well l'm off to the Junior Philharmonic meeting.
I don't know how I ever got involved in that.
I know very little about music.
Goodbye.
You know, I'll just hate myself in the morning.
- Thank you.
Goodbye.
- Bye.
Good morning, Samantha.
Good morning, Mother.
What brings you here so early?
Sheer boredom, darling.
Is?
Is what's-his-name up yet?
Yes, Darrin is up.
But I hated to wake him.
He had rather a restless night.
Fair enough.
I wish he could forget his work once in a while.
Oh, dear, without their work, men are nothing.
They're like little children.
- Not Darrin.
- He thrives on the aggravation.
- He loves feeling sorry for himself.
- Well, personally, I'd like to have him around a little bit more.
- He'd just be underfoot, darling.
Trailing you all around the house.
Sucking his thumb.
Dragging his teddy bear.
All mortal men are like that.
You just don't know Darrin.
You won't take your wise old mother's word about human men, will you?
- No.
- Well, you'll learn.
- I haven't got time for breakfast, honey.
- Hello?
Darrin!
That's right.
Please, Endora, not on an empty stomach.
Stop it, you two.
Talk about children.
Five minutes won't make a difference.
Sit down and have something to eat.
I'm too tense anyhow.
I'll see you tonight, honey.
Popcorn for breakfast?
Why not?
I'll have that breakfast now.
Darrin, what happened?
Nothing.
I just got smart.
I got outside, and I said to myself: "What are you knocking yourself out for?
Just how important is it, anyhow?
Let Larry take care of it".
Well, darling, I'm proud of you.
I'm not going in at all today.
Good.
You've been doing a lot of extra work lately.
You deserve a day off.
It's astonishing how relaxed I feel about it.
I have shopping to do, and the TV man's coming.
Can I leave Tabatha?
Feel free.
Sorry Mother left.
That makes one of us.
I just wanted her to see that you can relax and forget your work.
- I'll fix your breakfast.
- Thank you.
- Come in.
- Milk.
No kidding.
I thought you were the mailman.
Yeah, sure.
Hey, how about some nice cottage cheese today?
Come on, Mr. Stephens.
Be a nice fellow.
My boss keeps bugging me about my cottage cheese quota.
- That kind, huh?
- Oh, you got no idea the problems your average milkman has.
To begin with, I'm dealing with women all day long.
One wants mango flavouring in her yogurt.
Another one keeps complaining that my non-fat milk has too much fat in it.
And all the time I'm standing there she keeps dipping into a five-pound box of chocolates.
You hear?
That sounds like a bad scene, all right.
Hey, how come you're home today, Mr. Stephens?
Well, simple.
I didn't feel like going in today.
I like that.
He just didn't feel like working today.
Yeah!
- Pour yourself a cup of coffee.
- Right.
Sit down.
Here.
Here's the sports section.
Right.
Now, that's what I call a nice, healthy attitude.
My philosophy is, cottage cheese is your boss's problem.
Yeah?
Beautiful!
Mr. Stephens was due here for a meeting with me half an hour ago.
- Call his home.
- Yes, sir.
- Phone.
- Hello, phone.
It's not gonna stop.
Happiness House.
- Darrin?
- Hello, Larry.
How are you buddy boy?
No, I'm not sick.
I'm feeling great.
It's my boss.
Are you out of your mind?
Mr. Parkinson is on his way over here.
- Relax, relax.
- What?
- Let me talk to him.
- Just a minute, Larry.
Hello, Larry.
This is your friendly purveyor of dairy products.
- What?
- The milkman.
Listen, Larry I want you to stop needling my pal Darrin here.
If he don't wanna come in, he don't wanna come in.
You got it?
Goodbye.
Hey, who do you like in the fourth race?
Something wrong, Mr. Tate?
His milkman just chewed me out.
I better get over there and get him before the squirrels do.
You know what I enjoy more than anything?
Just lying around watching some other guy knock himself out.
Yeah!
You fellas are a big help!
What happened?
The cows turn off the faucets today?
I detect a note of hostility there.
Sure, I'm hostile.
I deal with nuts all day long, and you fellas are no exception.
Do you mind if I join you?
- That's the spirit!
Sit down!
- Be our guest.
The way I feel, I may never fix another set.
- Darrin?
- Hi, Larry.
- What is going on here?
- What's doing?
Darrin, you're coming with me to the office right now!
Hey, we happened to be watching that show.
What?
And ruin my whole day?
Larry, do you mind taking your high blood pressure someplace else?
What?
Darrin, for heaven's sake!
- You know what's wrong with you?
- The people working for me.
Knock it off, Larry.
You've got a great bunch of people working for you.
Like me, for instance.
You just take things too seriously, that's all.
Why don't you just relax, pal?
Now, just a second.
You're not my pal pal.
Larry, you're getting all worked up over nothing.
Now, just how important is Parkinson?
I mean, really.
That's a very interesting question.
Let's see, now.
Parkinson.
Who's he?
I think you're bluffing.
I will raise you another million.
Okay.
There's that million.
And I'll up you another million.
- Hello, everybody.
- Oh, hello, Mrs. Stephens.
- Hi, Sam.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Hello, darling.
Throw in a million for me.
I call.
You're in.
- What do you got?
- A pair of threes.
What about you?
I was bluffing.
Honey, we just made $15 million.
Well, these groceries cost $17 million.
Easy come, easy go.
Darrin, would you please take these into the kitchen for me?
Sure.
If you can't wait, deal me out.
We'll wait.
Got nothing else to do.
- How about some sandwiches, honey?
- Hold it, smiley.
- Yeah?
- I'm very glad to have you home, but Why, thank you, sweetheart.
Sandwiches?
All right, would you mind telling me what's going on?
What are Larry and the milkman and the TV man doing here?
Well, you know how I decided not to go to work today?
- The idea kind of caught on.
- That's strange.
- Not at all.
- Now, darling, you know I have a meeting this afternoon, so I'll need the living room.
- Oh, that's right.
- Would you mind telling them?
- I will right now.
- Thank you.
We'll move the game out to the patio.
Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
I'm Sarah Albright.
And this is Mary Wheeler.
Oh, do come in, and please, call me Samantha.
Thank you.
Oh, what a lovely home you have.
Oh, that's my husband.
He took the day off.
Oh, how nice that he can do that.
Oh, you have the table all set up for us.
Good.
- We can get right down to work.
- I can't tell you how much l've been looking forward to this.
- Once you get involved Lucille Dumont will see that you're kept very busy with committee work.
I like the feeling of being useful.
After all, our little daughter will be using that playground equipment someday.
Hey, Sam, Darrin says we need more sandwiches.
Oh, hi, there, ladies.
Tell Mr. Stephens that I'm very busy at the moment.
Right.
Isn't that our milkman?
I was wondering what happened to him this morning.
He's some sort of self-made philosopher and he and my husband got into a deep discussion.
And I said to Sgt.
McGreevy: "Goodbye, sarge.
When I get back l'm gonna tell the keeper of the gorilla cage to expect you".
That's funny, I said the same thing to my sergeant.
- Really?
- No kidding?
That's what I said to mine!
Isn't that a coincidence?
I said practically the same thing!
You're putting me on!
Look.
I've got a very short fuse, and it's burning!
- But Mr. Parkinson - I'm a very busy man, and my time is worth money.
I'm sending them a bill for the half-hour I've waited.
And in another five minutes, I go on double time!
I'll try to reach them for you.
You do that.
Well, how about a raffle?
Let's say 50 cents a ticket?
That means we'd have to sell 2000 tickets.
What about 75 cents a ticket?
That sounds better.
- Oh, excuse me.
- I'll get it, honey.
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
Let's see.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Miss Stewart.
Yeah, we're here.
Mr. Parkinson's there?
Well, I guess never the twain shall meet.
- It's Parkinson.
- Oh, give him my regards.
Sure, I'll talk to him.
Hello, Parky.
How are you?
Larry sends his regards.
Now, cool it, Parkinson.
Sure we have the layouts.
- Excuse me.
- They're great!
Today just isn't the day for a conference.
The moon's out of whack.
The planets are in the wrong quarter or something.
Darrin!
Will you please keep your voice down?
Oh, sorry, honey.
Hey, Parky, I can't talk to you anymore.
You're disturbing my wife's meeting.
About those sandwiches - Make them yourself.
- Okay.
Never mind.
On second thought just stay out of the house, and stay out of my way.
But, Sam, I can't eat any more of that popcorn.
Well, I'm sorry, Larry, but them's the conditions that prevail.
Well, I'd be happy to take the Maple Heights area.
I'm sure I can get other women to volunteer.
That's a large area to cover, Samantha.
Oh, well, it'll give me a chance to meet some of my neighbours.
It'll give me an opportunity to see the houses from the inside that I've been admiring from the outside.
We all like to do that, don't we?
My goodness.
It's usually so quiet around here.
Pardon me.
- Where are they?
- Who?
- Those two idiots, Tate and Stephens!
- Lf you're referring to my husband and his associate, they're in back.
- They won't be there long!
- Now, just a minute.
- Don't let me disturb your meeting.
Mr!
That was Mr. Parkinson.
He's a very important client.
Now, look here, Tate!
Are you still in the advertising business or are you starting a retirement community?
Parkinson, would you mind turning down your PA system?
My wife's having a very important meeting.
This is an outrage!
You have a confirmed appointment with me!
Perhaps we should call off the meeting and have it some other time.
No.
No, no.
I'm sorry.
Please, let's go on.
I chose your agency because I thought you were responsible people!
I set aside the whole day for you!
Well, you're through representing Randolph Parkinson, Jr., as of now!
Thanks.
Thanks for the lovely lunch.
Instead of having just a routine printing job done on the tickets l'll ask my husband to have the advertising agency design something different and arrange for the printing.
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Do you think he'd do it?
I promise you he will.
Honestly.
Now, who is the untidy little lady who parked her car half on and half off the curb?
Do you happen to be the little lady who likes to live so dangerously?
The gentlemen is in the backyard.
I look forward to meeting him.
Well, go right on through, officer.
Everybody else has.
I may just break down and cry.
And there we were a bunch of Gls, fresh from the Battle of the Bulge, when we spotted this French mademoiselle washing her clothes down by the river.
Who owns the sedan parked out front?
I do, officer.
Thanks.
Here.
Take care of this, will you?
Client relations is your department, Darrin.
Right.
Happy New Year!
Just what do you think you're doing?
I think you're all crazy.
He thinks we're crazy?
Deal me in.
Deal him in!
Deal the man in!
This is really going to be quite a job.
Well, this is too much.
Now, look here!
Oh, Mrs. Dumont.
- We were hoping you'd come.
- Thank you.
Well, ladies, how are we coming along?
Well, we've come to a Good gracious!
- Hey, there's a chicken in here.
- Is it dead?
- Hey, you got any bologna?
- Excuse me.
- What in the world?
- Where's the bread?
- Hey, you're all out of milk.
- I got a truck full of it.
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
You want a sandwich, Sam?
How about that?
- What?
- You've got to get rid of all these men.
They're just enjoying themselves forgetting their troubles.
- Do they have to forget here?
- They're ruining my meeting.
- I'm sorry, honey.
I really am.
We appreciated the popcorn, but we're hungry.
- We're growing boys!
- Popcorn?
I didn't buy any popcorn.
Right there in the big bowl.
- Popcorn.
- Fellas, we owe the ladies an apology.
We've been ruining their meeting.
Well, let's all go in there and apologize.
We'll go out and apologize, sweetheart.
- After you.
- Thank you.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin!
Mother.
I know you're here somewhere.
Mother, you take the spell off that popcorn!
Mother!
You need $1000 and you're gonna bother people with 75-cent tickets?
- That's ridiculous!
- That's the way we've always done it.
Well, forget it.
We'll get you the money, huh?
- Right.
- Ladies, I think it's time we left.
No, you sit right down, and we'll show you how it's done.
Yes, yes, yes.
For a charming woman like you, madam the world!
All right, men.
Line up by the phone.
- Here we go.
- Let's go, Larry.
Speaking for myself, this is just a waste of time.
Maybe we should reconsider the composition of this committee.
- Popcorn, ladies, please?
- Thank you.
- How nice.
- Thank you.
Hello, Joe?
Randolph Parkinson.
Some ladies are raising money for playground equipment in the park.
I got you down for $100.
Good!
Good!
Look, I've seen you spend more at the country club bar in an afternoon.
Fifty dollars you're down for.
Oh listen, and put the bite on Les, Jimmy and Al.
Stop crying, Jerry.
You live in the community, don't you?
And you've got a kid.
Loosen up.
You can't take it with you.
Scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours, Mr. Waggoner.
Send in that donation to the ladies and I'll double my cottage cheese quota.
Fair?
Isn't he cute?
The playground's in this precinct, and it'll keep kids off the street.
Well, that's very generous of you, Mr. Andrews.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- We made it.
Come on, men.
- Oh, boy!
There you are, ladies.
You'll have over $1500 sometime tomorrow.
- You're oversubscribed.
- That's wonderful!
- We're so grateful.
- I must say I've enjoyed sitting here eating this marvellous popcorn.
But I'm kind of sorry we shan't need our committee anymore.
So am I. Thank you very much.
Not at all, not at all.
Well, ladies, would you like some cottage cheese?
Chocolate milk for you.
Fresh milk for you.
- And non-fat.
- Non-fat.
And cottage cheese for you.
All right, Mother.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
You called me, dear?
All right, you've had your jollies for the day.
You've had your laugh.
Now, please, take that spell off.
Anything to please my little love.
- Women and children first.
- Good.
We'll have a party!
I'm half an hour late for my next meeting.
- Oh, I have a roast in the oven!
- I have to pick up Bobby.
Wait, where are you going?
- Goodbye, Samantha.
- Bye-bye.
Tate.
Tate!
Now, where are my layouts?
Fun's fun and all that but business is business!
- Right, right.
You're perfectly right.
- Darrin, you should be at the office.
- I'm on my way.
Will you please get your truck out of my driveway?
- Yes, sir.
Hey.
Would you please buy a couple quarts of cottage cheese from me?
Stop bugging me!
I got a million calls!
I can't finish lunch!
- Out of my way - Just a moment!
Little souvenir for you.
Oh, thanks.
Here.
- Darrin, you're client relations.
- Fine, Lar.
Bye, honey.
It was a very relaxing morning.
I'll do this more often.
I hope not.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
How do you do, madam?
Is there something you desire?
- No, thank you.
Just browsing.
- By all means.
Are you an antique buff?
Sort of.
Oh, you do have some lovely things.
Yes, we have some excellent pieces.
This desk, for instance.
Made in France in 1753, and priced at only $800.
Eight hundred dollars?
Well, it is beautiful.
- But I'm afraid that l - Yes.
Well.
Do you have something maybe in Early American, a little less expensive?
Less expensive?
Madam, I sell antiques, not used furniture.
How peculiar.
I thought I threw this away.
- What's the matter with it?
- It's a badly made copy.
Terrible workmanship.
Not our class of merchandise.
Oh, well, I think it's rather fascinating.
- Oh?
- How much is it?
Well, since you're so interested, only $100.
Well, I'm not that interested.
Just fascinated.
It's yours for 25 bucks.
All right then.
Thank you.
Madam, would you do me a favour?
Yes, I'll try.
Don't tell anyone where you bought it.
Really, madam!
Clumsy.
Oh, Tabatha, my goodness!
You are a mess.
Hello?
Honey, the Cosgroves will be over to dinner at 7:30, all right?
Oh, yeah, fine.
Tabatha's helping.
Your favourite.
Mushed-up bananas and spinach.
Made by hand, I hope.
Oh, very definitely.
- Yeah.
I'll see you later, honey.
- Okay.
Bye-bye.
She making something special?
Mushed bananas and spinach.
Much too good for the Cosgroves.
- I hate these annual dinners.
- Why?
It's always at my house.
- Larry, they'll renew the contract.
- I don't know.
I hear the Fairfield Agency is interested in the account.
Relax.
With Sam's delicious dinner in Cosgrove's stomach, we can't miss.
It's not his stomach I'm worried about.
It's his wife's mouth.
Right.
He doesn't make a move without her.
Not a move.
You know, I hate to see a guy depend on his wife like that.
- When are you coming over tonight?
- I'd better call Louise.
Well, don't sit there.
Go on home and see if everything's all right.
So early?
It's a whole four minutes before closing time.
Remember that when I don't give you a raise.
- Honey, I'm home.
- I'm in the kitchen.
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi.
That smells delicious!
- I'm boiling the baby's bottles.
- Oh.
The table's beautiful.
You'll have the Cosgroves eating out of your hands.
Good.
Then I won't need any plates.
Hey, where did you get that chair?
- At an antiques store.
- Why?
- It only cost $25.
- That's a good reason.
Oh, Darrin, I couldn't resist it.
You could have tried.
What are you gonna do with it?
- We could try sitting in it.
- Hey, that's an idea.
Where will you put it?
It doesn't fit in the living room.
- We'll think of something later.
- Mind if I put it in the den tonight?
- No.
Okay.
- Okay.
That still smells delicious.
And so there we were in Rome.
Italy, that is.
- Oh.
Italy.
- And I saw this gorgeous fountain.
And I say, "Isn't that a gorgeous fountain, Max"?
She's terribly clever.
She can always spot gorgeous fountains.
Oh, that's marvellous, because most of them are so run-of-the-mill.
- True?
- True.
Very true.
It was ridiculous, what they were asking for anything that old.
Why, they constantly try to cheat you over there.
It's almost impossible to get your money's worth.
You know you'll get your money's worth with our campaign.
I know about your campaign.
Don't talk business at dinner.
Where was I?
Oh.
You know, we've been around the world twice.
Next year we're planning to go someplace else.
Do you have any ideas where we can go?
Let's just go into the living room for now.
- That's not where I had in mind.
- Louise!
- I don't think he's gonna sign.
- Don't worry.
There's plenty of time.
Take another pill.
I've already eaten the box.
Where did you get this ultra-rare and unusual chair?
- An antiques shop - Marvellous.
I'll run over first thing.
Well, they only had one.
That could be a problem.
But not a big problem.
Not if you'd consider selling it to me.
Oh, believe me, Samantha I wouldn't dream of asking you if I didn't really want it.
I'd do anything to have it.
It just fits our house.
Doesn't it, Max?
This may be it.
Give her the chair.
Sam, what do you think?
Well, I rather like that chair.
Honey!
Well?
Mrs. Cosgrove if you really like the chair that much, I'd love for you to have it.
Oh, Samantha, that's very good of you.
- Baby doll - Quiet!
Angel.
How much do you want for it, Samantha?
Oh, nothing.
It's a gift.
Nonsense.
I want to make a business deal.
- So do we.
- Would $25 be too much?
Oh, it's worth much more.
- Pay her, Max.
- Yes, dear.
Well, now that that's all settled, let's talk some business, Max.
- Twenty-five dollars, my dear.
- Oh, Max, it's late.
Oh, I can't wait to see this chair in our living room.
- But the contract!
- Max will sign it in the morning.
In the morning?
He'll sign in the morning.
Max, I'll see you in the morning.
I'll put that in the car for you.
Oh, thank you.
- Oh, no, no.
- Need a little help?
No, Larry, I got it.
It can't be that heavy, Darrin.
- Couldn't be as easy as all that.
- No, it couldn't be.
- That's how they used to make chairs.
- See you in the morning.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Thank you so much.
- Enjoy it.
- Good night, dear.
- Good night, Mr. Cosgrove.
You're a very sweet boy, Darrin, but completely uncoordinated.
Come, Max.
Good night, all.
- Good night.
- Good night.
Honey, I hope you didn't mind giving them the chair.
For my part, I was glad to get rid of it.
Well, I do like the chair, but as long as it helps you, I don't mind.
Besides, I like you better.
I like you too.
I have a feeling there was something spooky about that chair.
A spooky chair?
Darrin, that's ridiculous.
Darrin?
Darrin?
- What was that?
- What was what?
That sound.
- I heard a noise downstairs.
- You must be dreaming.
I don't think so.
Then I must be.
Go back to sleep, honey.
Darrin, I heard a noise.
Maybe it's the baby.
Then she must be wearing your galoshes.
Say, you are a spooky chair.
When I came downstairs, there was that spooky chair bowing to me.
Oh, how charming.
Charming?
At 4 in the morning?
Mother, what could it be?
Well, I've heard of a few of us who've turned into objects.
- Really?
- Yes.
Some do when they retire.
Others do when they get angry.
Do you think it could be dangerous?
I don't know.
Why don't you test it on Darwood?
Oh, Mother, really!
Darrin doesn't even know about the chair.
No, I hid it before he went to the office.
- Hello?
- Hello, Sam.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
We were just talking about you.
Mother sends her love.
We got a problem.
The chair's been stolen from the Cosgrove's.
Stolen?
Well, Darrin, I think you ought to know that Adelaide blames Max for leaving the door open.
They're having an argument.
And while they're arguing, Max won't sign.
While they're arguing, Max won't sign.
Can you find another?
Well, I'm afraid it's one-of-a-kind.
Darrin, I think you ought to come home.
- Something wrong?
- No, no, it's Well, it's about the chair.
I can't talk about it on the phone.
- I'll be right home.
- Anything wrong?
- Something about the chair.
- Then go home.
Maybe she found it.
I'll send Louise to the Cosgrove's.
She's an expert on arguments.
- She is?
- Lots of experience.
All with me.
Oh, dear.
Mother.
Mother?
Oh, boy, you're always around when I don't need you, but when I do What is all that racket?
That's Darrin.
I had to tell him about the chair.
He came home, and now he's in the study fighting with it.
What do you want me to do, darling?
Referee?
Well, there must be something.
I told you it was a spooky chair.
And whoever or whatever it is, it absolutely hates Darrin.
We can't hold that against it, can we?
I can.
You don't suppose it could be one of our relatives?
Certainly not!
Not one of our relatives is in furniture.
Well, it's causing all sorts of trouble.
I can't give it back to the Cosgroves if it's bewitched.
What am I gonna do?
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
No, not a thing, until we know for sure what it is.
Well, yes, but It's Mr. Cosgrove!
Call me back.
Oh, hi, Mr. Cosgrove.
What a lovely surprise.
Dear, I'm sorry to bother you but I was on my way over to the antiques shop but I couldn't remember the name.
Where you purchased the chair?
Yes.
Darrin told me about the robbery.
Yes.
Adelaide blames me.
She says I left the door open.
Oh, I've just got to find another one, because What's that noise?
Darrin.
He's doing his morning exercises.
Does them every day.
Don't exercise too hard, dear.
Oh, hello, Mr. Cosgrove.
I wouldn't be missing my morning workout.
That's it!
That's the chair!
- That's - A copy.
Well, I can't tell.
Please let me take this to Adelaide.
She'll love it, and then she'll love me again.
- But Mr. Cosgrove, it's only a copy.
- I must have it!
Oh, I'm sorry, but when Adelaide gets angry, I just can't think straight.
Now, what does it cost?
I'll pay anything.
It's very expensive.
Much more than the original.
Good.
I do appreciate this, so just send us a bill.
I want Adelaide to see right away.
Why don't you let Darrin bring it to your house?
- I'd rather take it myself.
- No trouble.
It might scratch your car.
No, the sooner Adelaide forgives and forgets, the better.
I'll tell Tate to send the contract over to my house.
Thank you very much.
- Well, I guess he's gonna sign.
- Well, if he lives.
You don't think that chair's trying to blow the Cosgrove deal?
Well, I don't know, but that's what we've got to find out.
You go to the store, find out all you can about that chair.
How old it is.
Meet me at the Cosgrove's right away, and hurry.
- Right.
Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
Would you mind babysitting for a little while?
I'd love to!
Well, don't teach Tabatha any new tricks.
Oh, killjoy.
What are you going to do?
I'm going to the Cosgroves to keep an eye on that chair.
And while I'm gone, why don't you get in touch with Aunt Hagatha and Daddy and Aunt Enchantra.
They might know something about it.
All right?
Bye.
There, my sweet.
Just like the other one.
And I shall guard this with my life.
Oh, I'm so grateful to Samantha and Darrin - My darling, are you all right?
- Why did you do that?
But I did nothing, my love.
Nothing.
I never realized.
You're a dangerous man!
Go answer the door.
Adelaide, I'm really not dangerous.
Hi, Mr. Cosgrove, Mrs. Cosgrove.
I was just passing by Oh, Samantha.
You came just in time.
He just threw me out of the chair.
- Darling, I did not.
- You did!
I was sitting in it like Perhaps you shouldn't sit in it.
Maybe it has a broken leg.
She's right, darling.
Please, do be careful.
You see?
There's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, you and Darrin were such Oh, dear!
Mrs. Cosgrove, are you all right?
What?
Are you trying to choke me?
Darling, you know I'd never do anything like that.
Your front door was open, so we just walked right in.
- Hello.
- Hi, Louise, Larry.
- Sam.
- Tate.
- Well, Max.
- Mrs. Tate.
- Here we are with your contract.
- No time for contracts.
- You found another chair.
- Is Darrin here?
Max!
You broke my chair!
You did it on purpose.
That's it!
That's the last straw!
I'm going home to Mother!
Get my suitcase!
Adelaide!
Adelaide!
You can't leave me!
Mrs. Cosgrove, really.
I'm sure he had nothing to do with it.
- Adelaide!
- But Max, Max, the contract!
- I can't sign any contract now.
- Oh, Mrs. Cosgrove!
Adelaide!
Adelaide!
He'll never sign the contract.
Never!
The other agency will get him.
- Sam, what's going on here?
- Mrs. Cosgrove!
I'll give you anything you want.
I'll even go to Rome and buy that fountain for you.
And I'll buy the water!
Mrs. Cosgrove, I'm sure it can be worked out.
Did you find out anything?
The chair was bought in Boston at the turn of the century.
- Which one?
- Sam!
- Boston, huh?
- What does it mean?
Boston.
- Beans.
- Yeah?
Tea party.
Nothing.
Maybe Mother found something.
Wait here.
- Please, honeybunch?
- Mrs. Cosgrove.
- My mind's made up.
- What's with the Cosgroves?
You heard.
You just stay here and make sure the coast is clear, huh?
Stand up.
Now, come with me.
Mother.
Mother?
Mother, did you find out anything?
You remember?
Stop it!
You remember the Farnsworth family?
Yes, they lived on our street in Boston.
- Does it belong to them?
- Well, sort of.
It's not one of them?
Not him!
Yes.
He had Enchantra transform him when you rejected him.
Reject?
Wha?
I never rejected him!
I never even gave him any encouragement.
We were friends.
Not as far as he was concerned, love.
Oh Oh, Mother.
Well, what was the spell Aunt Enchantra used?
The simple one, without the oxtails.
All right.
Thank you.
Now, I think it's time for a little woman-to-chair chat.
I think you're right, dear.
Okay, Clyde Farnsworth.
You just come out here and face me like a A chair.
It won't do you any good to hide.
I said come here, and I mean it.
You realize the trouble you've caused?
Not just Darrin and me, look at the uproar the Cosgroves are in.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Clyde, I'm speaking to you.
Now, I might be able to understand, if you had any sort of excuse, but Well, that's no excuse.
That's nonsense.
You did not have yourself turned into a chair because I rejected you.
I told you on our first and only date that we could never be anything more than friends.
Oh, Clyde, now if you're gonna crumble up like that we're never gonna get anywhere.
Besides, that's no way to get my sympathy.
Much.
Look, Clyde, I don't understand.
If you're supposed to be in love with me, why are you causing this trouble?
Please, Mrs. Cosgrove, won't you reconsider?
Reconsider living with a dangerous man?
Please believe me.
I'm not dangerous, love pot.
Take my word for it, love pot I mean, Mrs. Cosgrove.
Sam, what are you doing?
Well, what do you think?
I'm talking to the chair.
- Ask a foolish question - Do me a favour.
Go back inside and make sure no one comes out here, understand?
Yeah, all right.
So that's it.
You're jealous of Darrin, huh?
Oh.
Now, Clyde, he is my husband, and I love him very much.
And nothing you can do can change that.
You understand?
Now, I'm gonna give you a choice.
You can either keep feeling sorry for yourself and remain an old chair or I can change you into human form, but I can't do it unless you're willing.
Good.
Chair of cloth and wood and grain Become a human being again Oh, Clyde.
Why, you haven't changed a bit.
Not even your clothes.
Samantha, you're as beautiful as you always were.
Isn't there any hope for us?
- We can still be friends.
- I'd like that.
- I'll be going now.
- Where are you going?
Back to the antiques store.
I've got someone there that loves me.
- Oh, does she work there?
- No.
She's a lamp.
Well Clyde, before you leave could I make a copy of you?
As a chair, I mean.
I really need it, and I can't do it without your permission.
Oh, please, allow me.
As a gift to you.
And Darrin.
Oh, well, Clyde, that's awfully sporting of you.
I should've listened to Pa.
That's who I should've listened to.
- Louise, don't just stand there.
- What do you want me to do?
- Mrs. Cosgrove, please?
- My mind's made up.
It's all right.
Mrs. Cosgrove!
- Mrs. Cosgrove?
- What?
- I fixed the chair.
- How could you?
Max broke the legs.
No, he didn't.
It has collapsible legs.
I pushed them back in place and locked them.
Then Max didn't break the chair?
Oh, Max, I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have blamed you, Tweety Bird.
Will you forgive me?
Of course I will, cupcake.
Will you forgive me?
- I forgive you, huggy bear.
- And I forgive you, poopsie.
Forgive me, but what about the contract?
Is it all right if I sign, love pot?
By all means, honeybunch.
Tea, anyone?
Darling, I'm proud of you.
Well, don't thank me, thank Clyde Farnsworth.
It's a gift from him.
- Clyde Farnsworth?
- Yeah, I'll explain later.
Okay.
Sam!
Well
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Oh, dear.
No, not fair.
Oh, dear.
- Aunt Clara.
Easy.
- I'm sorry, Samantha.
I'm sorry.
I thought I was popping into the kitchen.
Don't you worry about a thing.
You only missed by a few feet.
Oh, yes.
Oh, it's distressing.
- What?
- It's distressing.
- What?
- Oh, dear.
You know, I used to pop in on a dime.
Oh, but when you get old, you know, the equipment The navigation equipment, you know, it's not what it was.
Oh, yes, well Yeah, so I see.
Come on in, come on in.
You come in and sit down.
There you go.
Oh, go on, go on.
Do just what you were doing.
What are you doing?
Trying to fix this lamp.
But I think I've got it wired wrong.
Oh, dear.
Now, do be careful.
Electricity is a very tricky thing.
With all the watts and the ohms and the - I'll call an electrician.
- Oh, no.
Don't bother, Aunt Clara.
Darrin will look at it when he gets home.
I'm gonna take a look at Tabatha.
Just relax.
- Wait till you see how she's grown.
- Yes.
It's no bother.
No bother at all.
Hark ye, hark ye Ye witches who live in lamps Ye powers of watts And ohms and amps Wizards of AC/DC transmission Send me an electrician It worked.
Benjamin Franklin, at your service, madam.
Samantha, the electrician has arrived.
Here's the lamp, Mr. Franklin.
Madam, who are you?
What manner of contraption is that?
It's an ordinary lamp, and we want you to fix it.
- Excuse me, madam, who are you?
- Who are you?
Benjamin Franklin, madam, at your service, but l Benjamin Franklin?
Aunt Clara, what have you done?
Ladies, I fear you have the advantage.
You seem to recognize me yet I don't know you or where I am or, for that matter, how I came to be here.
Are you really Benjamin Franklin?
Madam, although a prudent man should be miserly with those things he holds to be certain I can assure you that I am indeed he.
Samantha, you know, electricians cost $7.50 an hour.
Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara, do you know what you've done?
You've brought back Benjamin Franklin.
The famous one.
Now, all he did was experiment with electricity.
- He wouldn't know how to fix a lamp.
- He wouldn't know how to fix a lamp?
Shocking.
Mr. Franklin, I'm Samantha Stephens.
And this is my Aunt Clara.
What did he say?
What did you say, I mean?
Oh, "We're pleased to meet each other" in French, Aunt Clara.
In Mr. Franklin's time, people often spoke French when they wanted to be polite.
In my time, madam?
In my time?
How come you?
How come you to say "my time" as if it were far removed from your own?
Forgive me, but I am perplexed.
Well, I don't blame you.
Forgive us.
Mr. Franklin this is 20th century America.
But that's impossible.
It's against the laws of nature.
You want to see a calendar?
And yet, I confess I find myself in strange surroundings.
The room filled with devices I've never seen before.
Can it be?
Is it possible that modern science has advanced so far as to be capable of transporting a man from one century to another?
Well, I suppose you could put it that way.
That's fantastic.
Absolutely fantastic.
You mentioned the word "electricity" earlier.
I'm curious.
I dealt with some of the natural phenomena of electricity.
I wonder, did anything come of it?
Electricity, Mr. Franklin.
But that That's astounding.
It's astounding.
Oh, it does work.
It works.
Oh, there were those in my day who would have clapped me in the stocks for dealing with witchcraft.
Oh, well, I remember Aunt Clara, let's get Mr. Franklin some coffee from the kitchen.
Oh, don't trouble yourself, ladies.
Although, if you happen to have a tankard of ale Why, Mr. Franklin, somehow I never thought of you as a drinking man.
Well, drinking doesn't improve our faculties, it's true, but it helps.
Come on, Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara, you have to get rid of him.
Nicely, of course.
Now, Samantha, he hasn't fixed the lamp, you know.
Aunt Clara, he isn't an ordinary electrician.
He's Benjamin Franklin, and he doesn't belong here.
Well, I suppose you're right.
Yes, I've done it again.
I've gone and witched the whole thing up.
Oh, no, no, you haven't at all.
It was just a little mistake in judgment.
As a matter of fact, I'm impressed that you were able to get him here.
It was a bit of the old Clara, wasn't it?
Oh, yes, you can still teach me a thing or two.
And I'm sure you can get rid of him just as easily.
Well, now, I don't know.
- It's much harder to reverse the spell.
- Yes, I know.
Well, Aunt Clara, you just stay in here and concentrate.
I'll go outside and entertain Mr. Franklin.
Yes, I'll concentrate.
Forgot.
One tankard of ale coming up.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Well, that's a fine way to greet a husband after a hard day at work.
What's that?
- And who is that?
- This is a tankard of ale.
Sam, who is he?
What have you done?
- Well, he - Samantha.
Oh, he's still here.
I thought I had it.
Mr. Stephens, I presume?
I'm proud to make the acquaintance of such a charming lady's husband and an enlightened gentleman of the 20th century.
- I thought I'd sent him back.
- I might have known.
Samantha Darling, dinner will be ready in about an hour.
Why don't you relax and have a nice chatty evening with Benjamin Franklin?
Benjamin Franklin?
That's right.
At the risk of your thinking me a vain and foolish old man can you tell me, has anything happened to the To the innovations that I began in Philadelphia?
Well, as you can see, electricity has caught on pretty well.
- Oh, we showed him that first thing.
- Yes.
Oh, yes, and I am delighted, of course.
Although I'm still very much in the dark about light.
He hasn't fixed the lamp yet, you know.
When I was in Philadelphia I began I began an experiment of lending books which I called the public library.
Every city has one.
New York City alone has over 50 branches.
Mr. Franklin, many of your inventions have become household words.
It's hard to tell you how important they are.
The public library, the fire department the rocking chair, bifocals.
Mr. Franklin, did you start the fire engine?
I started the fire department, madam, yes.
Darrin, I have a wonderful idea.
Instead of trying to tell all this to Mr. Franklin, why don't we show him?
Tomorrow, we can take him on a tour of the town.
- Well, that's a splendid idea, madam.
- Sam, no.
Now, Darrin, I think it would be much simpler, you know.
Have you two taken leave of your senses?
In case you've forgotten, Mr. Franklin did not exactly get here by bus.
But, Darrin, no one has to know how he got here.
I mean, he could Stay right where you are.
I'll get that.
- Darrin?
- Larry.
- Am I too early?
- Early?
For what?
For anything.
I'm just dropping in.
- Tonight?
- Yeah.
How'd you guess?
- Well, Larry, as a matter of fact - Still at dinner, huh?
I'll just have a drink while you finish.
Hi, Larry.
My, it's nice to see you.
Listen, you two finish dinner.
I know my way to the bar.
Darrin, why don't you have a drink with Larry?
I'll clear off the table.
Well, the electricity comes from outside, you know.
Isn't that so, Samantha?
Larry, you know my Aunt Clara.
And this is Aunt Clara's friend.
Who's a friend of Aunt Clara's.
Aunt Clara.
Costume party.
We're going to a costume party.
Oh, Tate.
Larry Tate.
Costume party, huh?
Oh, wait a minute.
Don't tell me.
Let me guess.
Thomas Jefferson.
No, sir.
Mr. Jefferson was much taller.
My name is Benjamin Franklin.
Of course.
I should've gotten it right off the bat.
Those square glasses.
Yes, they're called bifocals.
I invented them.
One can look through the top part or the bottom Hold it.
You're not going to any costume party.
- We're not?
- Darrin, you sly dog.
No wonder you didn't wanna let me in.
You wanna spring it at the meeting.
- What are you talking about?
- Sam, you've got a sneaky husband.
Brilliant, but sneaky.
We've been racking our brains for just the right approach to the Franklin Electronics account.
You know, something socko, original.
And here it is, Franklin himself.
I don't believe I understand, sir.
You wish me to lend my name to a commercial venture?
Terrific, terrific.
Just the right quality.
Integrity, honesty.
Let's hear some more.
And this time, sprinkle in a few "thees" and "thous".
You know, for the old-world flavour.
Aunt Clara, why don't you show Mr. Franklin how the telephone works?
Wonderful gadget, the telephone.
Works by electricity.
Well, yes.
Well, just come this way.
Yes.
Thank you.
Come on, Darrin.
You don't need to keep up the act.
I'm convinced.
Just wait till Bernie Franklin hears about this.
He'll be tickled pink.
Oh, Larry, I don't think it's such a hot idea.
It's a question of Sam, they're going outside.
Aunt Clara has a cold.
She can't go out without her sweater.
Abner, there's something funny going on over there.
Something funny "ha-ha," or something funny "you're seeing things again"?
Mr. Franklin.
Aunt Clara.
Don't you think we ought to go inside?
It's getting a little chilly out here.
Mrs. Stephens.
Yoo-hoo, Mrs. Stephens.
That lady seems to be hailing you, madam.
Mrs. Stephens.
Mrs. Stephens, I wonder whether I could borrow Hello.
My name is Kravitz, Gladys Kravitz.
- My name is - Mrs. Kravitz, you know my Aunt Clara.
- They're going to a costume party.
- Costume party?
- How come she isn't dressed?
- Oh, but I am.
I'm going as a witch.
Mrs. Kravitz, what is it you wanted to borrow?
- Well, just a - Mrs. Kravitz.
Good night, Sam.
Clara.
Oh, and good night, Ben.
You son of a gun.
Ben.
Benjamin Franklin.
I was right.
I was right.
No, Mrs. Kra - Funny frog.
- That's a funny frog.
It's a green frog.
You know what his name is?
Fergus?
- Funny frog.
- Fergus frog.
How can you talk when your hand Yeah.
For the guy who said, "Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise," Mr. Franklin sure can sleep.
If you travelled two centuries, you'd be sleepy too.
Better not let him sleep too long.
You've got lots to see.
And while you're sightseeing, keep trying to make Aunt Clara remember that spell to send him back, please.
- Don't worry, darling.
- And you call me every half-hour.
Shall we synchronize our watches?
We are synchronized.
See you tonight.
Bye, darling.
- Bye-bye, Daddy.
- Samantha.
- Bye-bye.
- Oh, Samantha.
Oh, he's gone.
- Mr. Franklin.
He's gone.
- Oh, Aunt Clara.
- You mean you remembered the spell?
- No, no.
No, he's gone.
He's gone.
He isn't here.
What I mean What I mean to say is he's not here, but There.
"Not wishing to be the source of domestic discord l've decided to see a bit of the city myself.
With kindest regards, B. Franklin".
Oh, Aunt Clara, that's terrible.
- It is.
- I'll get a babysitter.
Yes.
Oh, oh, dear.
Come on, Tabatha.
Well, that's the electric company, the phone company and three fire stations, and still no sign of him.
Oh, dear.
Don't you think you should phone Darrin?
Oh, no.
No, no, Aunt Clara.
No sense in him worrying too.
I have an idea.
Let's try the public library.
Come on, mister, let us in on the gag.
What are you advertising?
I'm merely waiting, sir, for the library to open.
In those weirdo rags?
Which, by your sundial, sir, should be in exactly 10 minutes.
Come on, buddy boy.
Stop putting us on.
What are you pitching, huh?
A new movie or something?
Hey, I know.
Shampoo.
Oh, leave the old guy alone.
What's bugging you, buster?
You got a gripe?
Young man.
In the sense that one may learn a good deal about a man by his clothing I am, in fact, advertising myself in the same sense that you, by your appearance, proclaim what you are.
By your clothes and countenance I take you to be advertising dirt, slovenliness and a dislike for soap and water.
Your demeanour proclaims your insolence and your disrespect.
By your speech, I suspect you are advertising rudeness, vulgarity and ignorance for the English language.
Good day.
The old man can take care of himself.
I'm from the Morning Gazette.
Can I ask you a few questions?
Mr. Franklin, I certainly am glad we found you.
- You needn't have bothered.
- Oh, no bother at all.
But I do think we should be running along.
We've got lots to see.
Franklin, huh?
- How long has he been like this?
- Oh, about 200 years.
Give or take a few.
Come along.
It's marvellous, simply marvellous.
What a contraption.
I should imagine it's very efficient too.
Oh, well, this one must be at least 35 years old.
The ones they use now are inside.
- Would you like to inspect it further?
- Indeed I would.
Good.
Well, I'll be right back.
I just wanna call Darrin.
Larry, it's just not dignified, that's all.
What could be more dignified than a man playing Benjamin Franklin pitching transistor radios?
The Franklin Electronics people were ecstatic.
- You told them?
- Of course.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Sam.
How's it going?
Don't you worry, darling.
Everything's going beautifully.
And Mr. Franklin's very grateful to all of us.
And this machine operates on the same principle as these other conveyances I see?
Yes, yes, you see, it's an automatic.
And there's a button that you press to start it.
Oh, yes.
This button here?
- Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
- Well This is very exciting, but how does one turn it off?
If you If you What?
Well, don't you think you've seen enough?
Don't forget, Aunt Clara has some memory work to do this afternoon.
I seem to be moving.
Where's the braking device?
The pedal.
Press the pedal.
Oh, there must be a spell for this.
There must be a spell for Mr. Franklin, come back.
Listen.
We'll be home in about an hour.
Samantha.
Oh, Samantha.
- The fire engine.
- Well, what happened, Aunt Clara?
- He I'm telling you.
- What?
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, my goodness.
Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Sam?
Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara, go home.
And please, try and remember that spell.
Yes, yes.
I will, I will, I will.
Mr. Franklin?
Mr. Franklin, are you all right?
Right this way, lady.
- I am unhurt, madam.
- Hey, mister, where's the fire?
Oh, officer, I'm Samantha Stephens.
- I'm sure I can explain everything.
- Well, fine.
Why don't you do it down at the station house?
This gentleman, whoever he is, is under arrest.
Right this way, sir.
What a story: "Ben Franklin Steals Fire Engine".
Right.
Aunt Clara, now, you remember that spell.
Right?
You'll remember that spell at once.
Right.
What spell?
What you're supposed to remember.
Oh, dear.
I'm the dumbest witch of all.
This has all the trappings of some kind of publicity stunt.
The idea that a name like Benjamin Franklin is involved in this kind of proceeding As to whether Benjamin Franklin is involved or not, Your Honour I believe I'm the best judge of that.
The charge is grand theft, and bail is set at $1,000.
I'll put up bail, Your Honour.
Your Honour, could you tell us when the trial will be?
- Oh, in about four weeks.
- Four weeks?
Your Honour, due to the advanced age of the defendant couldn't we have the trial sooner?
- How old are you?
- Two hundred and sixty.
Four weeks.
You can pay the clerk.
We should have protested more vigorously.
The constitution guarantees to every citizen the right to a speedy trial.
Don't you worry, Mr. Franklin.
You won't have to stand trial.
Oh, wait a minute, Sam.
We can't send him back now.
If he doesn't appear in court in four weeks, I'll lose $1,000.
I understand, of course Abner, Ben Franklin.
There he is.
Come quick, come quick.
- Although it grieves me to impose upon your hospitality this way.
We're delighted to have you.
As long as you don't cause any more trouble.
- Where is he?
Mr. Franklin?
- Oh, no.
Ben Franklin?
Where's Ben Franklin?
He was He was there just He was He was there I remembered.
I remembered.
Aunt Clara, Aunt Clara, you've got to bring him back or we're out $1,000.
Well, if What?
Now she remembers.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
- Yes, Helen.
- Mr. Stephens there's a gentleman from the district attorney's office.
Well, send him in.
Mr. Stephens, Chuck Hawkins.
I'll be prosecuting Benja Mr. Franklin, for the city.
- Well, won't you sit down, Mr. Hawkins?
- Thank you.
I hope you don't think that I had anything to do with this.
You know, Mr. Stephens, lots of people have the idea that the district attorney's office is only interested in sending people to jail.
You mean, you have a bad public image?
Well, the truth is, we're dedicated public servants.
We're concerned about people.
Plenty of mayors and governors have started in my job.
And it would certainly be a shame to hurt a budding political career by an unpopular case.
If I thought the crime was serious, I'd prosecute to the hilt.
But, after all, taking a fire engine So the old guy's a little eccentric?
No one was hurt.
So instead of subjecting the people of this city to a long and expensive trial With lots of publicity.
- My office is prepared to reduce the charge to disturbing the peace.
Now, if Mr. Franklin will plead guilty I can assure you he'll get a suspended sentence or a light fine.
Mr. Hawkins, I take back everything I've ever said about the DA's office.
We don't have to wait four weeks for a misdemeanour.
Have him down at Division 20 day after tomorrow.
Darrin, have you seen this about your friend, Ben Franklin?
It's terrific.
Oh, sorry to interrupt.
You can't buy this kind of publicity.
Larry, meet Mr. Hawkins of the DA's office.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
The Franklin Electronics Corporation are going to be in seventh heaven.
- What a send-off for the campaign.
- So it was a gimmick, huh?
Stephens, the charge is grand theft.
And I intend to see that Franklin, or whoever he is is prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
Mr. Hawkins, is the trial back to four weeks away?
And lose all this publicity?
Day after tomorrow, Stephens.
Felony court.
Now there are TV people outside and it's attracted the entire neighbourhood.
Aunt Clara, you have to remember that spell.
We have to get Benjamin Franklin back here.
- Yes.
Yes.
- I'll try and stall them.
Samantha Stephens?
I'm Bill Whalen of WXIW news and I'd like to speak to Mr. Franklin.
I'm sorry, but he has no comment.
Oh, but even no comment from Mr. Franklin is news.
Where is he?
Now, that's funny.
I've got something in my eye.
Why don't you come back when you've gotten it out?
She did it.
She wiggled her nose.
I saw her.
I saw the whole thing from the beginning.
- First Benjamin Franklin.
Next - Next what?
Who are you?
Franklin Pierce, sir, - Aunt Clara.
- Oh, I missed it again.
Did I see what I thought I saw?
Must have been that something in your eye.
Aunt Clara, when you got Benjamin Franklin you were trying for an electrician to fix my lamp.
Yes, that was the spell, but I couldn't work it out.
That Gladys Kravitz is telling that television reporter everything she's seen.
And then she raised her arms like this and said, " Hark ye, witches who live in lamps" - Yeah, yeah, lady.
Sure.
- She did.
She said it all.
Aunt Clara did it begin, " Hark ye, witches who live in lamps"?
Oh, that's it, that's it.
"Hark ye, witches who live in lamps".
Oh, yes.
Hark ye, witches who live in lamps Sam, don't let her point at me.
Darrin, where'd you come from?
Well, I saw the crowd outside, so I snuck around back.
What is going on?
Aunt Clara's remembered the spell.
Go ahead, Aunt Clara.
Hark ye Hark ye, witches who live in lamps The power of watts And ohms and amps And The wizards of AC/DC transmission Send to me an electrician As you were saying, Mr. Stephens Mr. Franklin, thank heaven you're back.
I wasn't aware that I'd left.
But if this is the reception you give return voyagers I must go away more often.
What has transpired during my absence?
For one thing, the trial's day after tomorrow.
Day after tomorrow?
And the district attorney's out for blood.
He thinks this is some kind of advertising stunt.
Darrin, shouldn't we get Mr. Franklin a lawyer?
Honey, we can't.
What could we tell him?
Mr. Franklin, couldn't you defend yourself?
No, that might be unwise.
The man who defends himself has a fool for a lawyer and a jackass for a client.
- Abraham Lincoln said that.
- Abraham who?
Whoever, he stole it from me.
Maybe Darrin's right.
After all, Mr. Franklin, you are innocent.
Mrs. Stephens, it's the innocent who need an attorney.
The guilty can lie for themselves.
Oh, I like that.
Remind me to remember that.
May I also remind you that I told you the district attorney thinks this is a publicity stunt and he's going to use that to turn the jury's sympathy against Mr. Franklin?
Well, we know it isn't true.
The only way we can get public sympathy on our side is for the people to see and hear Mr. Franklin.
Sam, there isn't time.
The trial is one day away.
Darling, you forget you're married to a witch.
Now, I can't change public opinion but I can help it along a little bit.
Boys and girls for today's Celebrity Day assembly we are honoured to have with us a member of America's team of astronauts.
It is a great pleasure to present to you someone who could be the first American on the moon Benjamin Franklin.
Thank you.
Oh, yes, Samantha, dear.
Yes.
Yes, I think I can handle that.
Right.
Right away.
That, ladies and gentlemen wraps up this edition of WXIW afternoon news.
This is Bill Whalen signing off until 6 this evening.
Correction, please.
There seems to be one more item.
In response to the sudden wave of Benjamin Franklin fever which is sweeping the city, this station invites all interested viewers to call us collect to express their opinion.
Oh, I did it.
I did it.
Oh, won't Samantha be pleased.
This is the Real Don Steele happening on Boss Radio, baby.
Those were the Nebbishes with their release "Snarl, Baby, Snarl, If You Love Me".
And now, gang, what you have been waiting for.
The number one sound on the all-new Big Boss 30 survey Ben Franklin delivers a speech to the Pennsylvania Constitutional Convention.
How about that, fun devils?
I like it, I like it.
There's a front-page story on Mr. Franklin in every paper.
They've been talking all day about it on television.
- Shall I turn it on?
- Oh, no, please.
Please, Aunt Clara.
Enough's enough.
That was Larry on the phone.
He can't get it through his head that all this isn't somehow connected with the Franklin Electronics account.
Will it help, sir, if I speak to the gentleman?
Oh, no, Mr. Franklin.
The only thing that would help is for you to be acquitted and then just to Disappear.
I understand.
But what if I'm not acquitted?
- What would you do if convicted?
- I'd go to jail, madam.
I wish you were more optimistic.
Optimists, madam, believe that all will turn out for the best.
They are, therefore, constantly disappointed.
I, on the other hand, prepare myself for the worst.
Should it not occur, I am delightfully surprised.
That's cute.
Now, if you will excuse me, I must get back to preparing my address to the court.
Stop worrying.
- Start.
- Ladies and gentlemen of the jury I intend to prove that the defendant, whoever he is used the honoured name of Benjamin Franklin as part of an advertising campaign the sole purpose of which is to sell transistor radios.
Now, unfortunately, there's no law against tasteless advertising.
But in the process of his activities the defendant made a mistake.
He stole a valuable public monument, a rare old fire engine that was on display in front of Fire Station Number Three.
Now, such a crime is more serious than ordinary theft because the man who steals public property steals not only from one man, but from everyone.
Oh, an excellent point, an excellent point.
It's your turn, Mr. Franklin.
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury human reason is a very uncertain thing because two people can arrive at diametrically opposed positions from the same premise.
Consequently, I think that a good, sure instinct is worth a great deal more.
Now, the district attorney, I fear, has set himself a very difficult task.
First, he must prove that I stole a fire engine.
Now, what motive could a man have for stealing a fire engine?
Unless, of course, he needed to put out a fire.
And, second, the district attorney must prove that I am not Benjamin Franklin but, in fact, an impostor.
If he succeeds, I shall have to conclude that not only have I been mistaken as to my identity all these many years but that my honoured father and mother were somewhat confused at my birth.
You're the head librarian at the main branch of the library?
- That's right.
- And is that the man who walked into your library a few days ago?
Yes, that's him, Benjamin Franklin.
Just "yes" or "no" will do.
What happened when he approached you?
Well, of course, there was quite a disturbance.
I mean, everyone started whispering.
And you can't have that sort of thing in a library.
I mean, there are signs all over.
Then you would say he definitely created a disturbance?
- Yes.
- What else did he do?
He wanted to pay a library fine on a book that was 200 years overdue.
He wanted to pay a library fine on a book that was overdue for 200 years.
Not exactly.
You see, he didn't actually have the book.
But he said that he had neglected to return it and it had been on his conscience for 200 years.
- Your witness, sir.
- No questions, Your Honour.
You've made my point.
I'm nothing if not an honest man.
You mean to say that the defendant actually walked out on stage and made a speech to the students in the auditorium?
- Yes, sir.
He did.
- Had you planned to have him speak?
No, we planned a totally different speaker.
I don't even know why I announced him.
So he completely disrupted your assembly?
Well, at first he did, but then - Naturally, you were outraged.
- Well, yes, in the beginning Please, just Just answer the question.
He's trying to, but you won't let him finish.
Boy, would I love to put a hex on him.
- How you think he'd look as a duck?
- Sam.
Go on, sir.
But what?
Well, I just wanted to say that he gave the finest speech I've ever heard.
He talked about America as the land of opportunity an education as something precious.
Even more precious because it was available to everyone.
What was the reaction of the students?
Well, you know modern kids are pretty sophisticated.
They can tell a phoney a mile off.
But you could've heard a pin drop while he was speaking.
And afterwards, they cheered him for five minutes.
Thank you.
Any more questions for this witness, counsellor?
No more questions, Your Honour.
No questions, Your Honour.
I think if the jury went out now, they'd convict the DA.
Well, I'm ready to rest my case.
I call Darrin Stephens to the stand.
If only he were ready to rest his.
And have you ever discussed the idea of using Benjamin Franklin as part of an advertising approach to the Franklin Electronics account?
I never brought it up.
Well, did anyone in your office bring it up?
Yes.
- Who?
- My boss.
Mr. Stephens, I just have one more question.
Who is that man sitting at that table?
Remember, you're under oath.
To the best of my knowledge, Benjamin Franklin.
Does he really believe that?
You know something even crazier?
I'm beginning to believe it.
And when Mrs. Stephens introduced me she said they were going to a costume party.
But I knew that wasn't true.
- You see, she's a - You didn't believe her?
Oh, of course not.
I knew how he had gotten there.
They cast Did Mr. Tate, Mr. Stephens' boss, join you then?
- But I wanted to tell you - What did he say?
He said, "Good night, Ben".
And then he sort of winked.
Thank you, Mrs. Kravitz.
That'll be all.
But don't I get to tell you what I know about her?
Only if someone asks you.
Your witness, Mr. Franklin.
Mr. Franklin, you can't cross-examine her.
But I must.
Her testimony's very damaging.
It'll be a lot more damaging if she gets a chance to go on.
No questions, Your Honour.
That'll be all, madam.
You may step down.
Well - The prosecution rests, Your Honour.
- This court will recess for 15 minutes.
Time to start worrying again, right?
Right.
It was going fine until I got on the stand.
I'm afraid, with Mr. Stephens' testimony and that Kravitz woman the district attorney established a plausible motive for someone taking a vintage fire engine.
Vintage fire engine.
Vintage.
I'll be right back.
Mr. Franklin, call me as your next witness.
Would you tell the jury, Mrs. Stephens where you got the plaque you hold in your hand?
From the fire engine at Station Number Three.
Would you read the inscription?
"Benjamin Franklin Memorial Fire Engine".
Your Honour, I'd like to enter this plaque as exhibit A. - Your Honour, may I ask a question?
- Lf it's relevant.
How can the district attorney accuse Mr. Franklin of stealing his own property?
He hasn't proved he is Benjamin Franklin.
And you, sir, have not proved that I am not.
I will admonish this gallery only once.
Another outburst like that and I'll have this courtroom cleared.
Thank you, Your Honour.
No more questions.
Do you believe the defendant is Benjamin Franklin?
- Yes.
- How can you be so sure?
Just look at him, listen to him talk.
That's no answer.
How do you know?
Well, if he isn't why would he have tried to pay for a book that was 200 years overdue?
Mrs. Stephens, do you know the penalty for perjury?
- Oh, hush up.
- Your Hon I don't see that it makes any difference whether he's Benjamin Franklin or not.
He represents Mr. Franklin, doesn't he?
Now, the district attorney accuses him of creating a disturbance in the library.
But he doesn't mention the fact that he was honest enough to pay a 200-year-old fine or that Benjamin Franklin created the first public library.
He also accuses him of taking a fire engine.
But he doesn't mention the fact that Benjamin Franklin started the first volunteer fire department.
Aren't you going to object to this, counsellor?
Doesn't look that way, Your Honour.
Now, it seems to me that whoever he is all this gentleman has done since he's been here is to remind us of the wonderful things Benjamin Franklin has done.
And of the heritage of wisdom that he left us.
Now, if I were the district attorney l'd want to thank him instead of trying to send him to jail.
Objection.
I think you're a little late, counsellor.
- Congratulations, Mr. Franklin.
- Thank you.
- I knew you could do it.
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.
- That was a great speech, Sam.
Oh, thank you, Larry.
Mr. Franklin this jury has found you not guilty a judgement in which the court concurs.
You are free to go, but I would like to ask you one question.
Do you intend to continue being Benjamin Franklin?
Your Honour I believe that a man's wisdom, if he have any should be left to future generations to measure against their own circumstances.
If a man lives beyond his time and attempts to impose old notions upon new generations he puts himself in very grave danger of losing any claim to wisdom at all.
Therefore, Your Honour although I shall continue to be Benjamin Franklin for I can do no other I shall no longer be that untimely gentleman in your gracious company.
Good day, sir.
Well, if he isn't, he ought to be.
Court's adjourned.
Aunt Clara, I don't think this is such a good idea.
Mr. Franklin, you said yourself it was time to go back.
And so I shall, sir after this dear lady and I have a night, as you put it, on the town.
Didn't you once say, "Early to bed, early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise"?
Yes, I did, I did.
But that was before the electric light.
Don't you think that your escort should be more appropriately dressed?
I'll get one of Darrin's suits.
No, no, no.
I can do it.
- Is this a button loose on your coat?
- Well, I hadn't noticed.
Tarrel, tarrel Morning glorious Correct appel Apparel Sartor, sartorius Oh, I goofed again.
Oh, no.
No, Aunt Clara, you look beautiful.
Madam, you are a vision of loveliness.
Oh, I congratulate you all for living in this marvellous 20th century where such things are possible.
Oh, let us go on, madam.
Well, don't wait up, children.
Good night.
Oh, I'm sure they'll be all right, sweetheart.
After all, they're both over 200.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Forced landing.
My goodness!
Oh, good heavens, Aunt Clara.
- Are you all right?
- Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- My goodness.
- Oh, yes.
Oh, well.
My, I'm glad you dropped in.
Darrin's in Boston on business.
- Yes, I know.
- You do?
- How's Tabatha?
- Wonderful, just wonderful.
We're going to the park as soon as I measure the gazebo.
Oh, yeah.
The what?
The gazebo.
That thing you just crashed through.
- The summer house.
- Oh, well.
Oh, dear.
Well, I feel much better crashing into the gazebo than I would the summer house.
- You wanna come to the park with us?
- Oh, I'd love to.
Afterwards, would you mind babysitting for a while, while I go to the bank?
You see, I have been delegated by Darrin during his absence to negotiate a loan.
- How about that?
- Oh, I'm very impressed.
What does it mean?
It means we'd like to borrow money from the bank so we can tear down the gazebo and put up a rumpus room.
- Oh, well, I wish I'd known.
- Known what?
Well, if I'd known you were gonna tear this thing down I would've tried to land right dead centre.
- Oh, my goodness.
- Oh, yes.
- This is where we usually sit.
- Oh, it's a lovely spot.
- Lovely.
- Good morning.
Good morning.
Isn't that cute?
No, Tabatha.
That doesn't belong to you.
No.
Come, dear, while Mother gets a drink of water.
She's got enough toys now to open a toy store.
Yes.
Tabatha, I said, no.
- Funny pony.
- No, it's not a funny pony.
It's an elephant.
Elephant.
And you must not take what doesn't belong to you.
That's very wrong.
- Yes, that's very wrong.
- Funny pony.
She needs more sleight of hand if she's going to act like that, you know.
What happened to?
Well, of all the nerve!
- Well, I'm terribly sorry, but - Can't you get her one of her own?
- Well, l - Here, love.
Here you are.
Please, let me explain.
You see, it was just an accident.
Well, maybe "accident" isn't quite the right word.
How about "regrettable occurrence"?
"Unfortunate circumstance"?
Oh, she's very hard to please.
Accident, eh?
Some accident, you You You toy snatcher, you!
I'm Mr. Scranton.
You wish to see me about applying for a loan?
Yes.
Well, actually, my husband is applying for the loan.
But a business matter came up, and it made it impossible for him to be here so I volunteered to come and give you any information you might need.
Sort of expedite matters.
Isn't that how you bankers put it?
- No.
You're Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes, Mrs. Darrin Stephens.
Come in, please.
Sit there.
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yes, Hawkins?
The appraisal on the Nelson house.
I have completed it.
To put it simply and kindly under no circumstances would I recommend the loan.
Well, why not?
The Nelsons' credit rating Shall we say that the Nelsons' character references fell short of the mark.
They did?
But they seemed so solid.
Well, they certainly could have fooled me.
Well, forgive me, sir, but not me.
I never believe what I see on the surface.
I like to dig.
Oh, I'm sorry.
This is Mrs. Stephens.
She's applying for a loan for her husband.
- Hi there.
- How do you do, I'm sure.
You see, actually, it's my husband who I just can't believe it about the Nelsons.
Have you ever applied for a loan with us before?
No, sir, but we use your calendars.
- What is the purpose of the loan?
- Home alterations.
My husband wants to tear down our gazebo and build a rumpus room.
I see.
What's a gazebo?
Permit me, sir.
A gazebo is a quaint word, fast going out of style that some people, few though they may be use when they refer to a summer house.
Most of them are very small.
The summer houses, I mean.
If it's a summer house, why don't you call it that?
Oh, I will.
I will.
Well, where is your husband employed, Mrs. Stephens?
Advertising agency, McMann & Tate.
McMann & Tate?
- McMann & Tate!
- That's right.
Why, my brother's firm is one of their biggest accounts!
Why didn't you say so?
Welcome aboard!
- How much do you want?
- Who is your brother?
Well, Tom Scranton, president of Super Soapy Soap.
Super Soapy Soap?
Why, that's one of the firm's largest accounts!
Is that so?
Well!
"Super Soapy Soap: The soap your skin loves to sud".
Say, wasn't it your husband's firm that came up with that slogan?
My husband wrote it.
Well!
What a small world this is!
I know your husband's boss.
Larry Tate, right?
Right!
Larry Tate.
Good old Larry Tate.
Well, well!
Well, we can move this loan right along.
There'll just be this little application for you to fill in.
A mere formality, I assure you.
If my brother can trust your husband's firm with a million-dollar account I guess we can risk a few bob on him.
Are you still here, Hawkins?
Hawkins, I want you to go out this afternoon and inspect Mrs. Stephens' property.
- Just a formality.
- Yes, sir.
A loan to tear down a summer house A gazebo, Hawkins!
A gazebo.
A gazebo.
Oh, Aunt Clara, everything just went beautifully at the bank.
You Tabatha.
Me Jumbo.
What on earth are you doing?
Oh, it's so long since I've been an elephant.
Why are you trying to be one now?
Tabatha wants that toy elephant that she saw in the park.
Remember?
Why don't we try this?
It's one of her favourites.
I did.
I've tried every toy in the house.
I've tried everything.
Oh, dear.
Excuse me.
Oh, just a minute.
No There's one thing I haven't tried.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Darrin.
I'm so glad you called.
Guess what.
They're gonna give us the loan.
Oh, they're practically gonna give us the bank.
In the park, all pink and new Polka dots of every hue Hear this wish, hear this chant Tabatha wants an elephant Oh, dear!
Oh, I will, dear.
I'll see that everything is shipshape when the appraiser comes.
Oh, now, Darrin, sweetheart, don't worry.
I promise you, everything will be in perfect order.
Hurry home.
Bye.
Oh, my stars!
Aunt Clara, what have you done?
Well, I Get Get Get rid of this elephant.
- What elephant?
- This elephant.
- Tabatha loves him.
- Well, the bank won't.
Aunt Clara, you've got to do something.
- You've got to get rid of it.
- You mean now?
Yes, now.
Oh, I can't.
I'd love to oblige, dear.
But, unfortunately, I can't.
Well, Aunt Clara, you cast the spell.
Just uncast it.
Yes, but I can't without the toy from the park.
I should have had that in the first place.
Well, you should have thought of that before.
But I was thinking of elephants.
I can't think of everything, you know.
Oh, of course you can't, dear.
We have to have that toy.
I hope the woman's still there.
I'll go see.
Oh, yes.
And I'll stay with Tabatha.
And in the meantime, I'll work on it.
Yes, fine.
All right.
Oh, no.
No, if I leave you here and you work on it l'm apt to have an entire zoo before I get back.
Now, come over this way.
Come on.
Now, there must be some other spell we can use.
- Yes.
- Okay?
Well, so let's try one.
Well, try something.
Try anything.
Colours pink and blue and grey Why don't you just all go away?
Yes.
I was afraid that was no good.
I have it!
Oh, I have the perfect solution.
What?
Call the exterminator.
Oh, Aunt Clara.
- Hello?
- Hello, Sam.
Larry.
Oh, hi, Larry.
How are you?
Oh, I'm fine.
Just fine.
How are you, Sam?
Oh, listen.
The reason I called is I just had a funny call from Leon Scranton.
Leon Scranton, the bank president?
Yeah.
The reason he called me was he had a funny call from the appraiser.
- The appraiser?
- Yeah.
Are you ready for this?
The appraiser told Scranton that you have an elephant in your living room.
He did?
Why would he say a thing like that?
Now wait, wait, wait.
There's more.
- There is?
- He also said that the elephant was pink with multicoloured polka dots!
Well, that's That's crazy.
Isn't it?
Of course.
Don't worry.
I took care of everything.
- You did?
How?
- Listen, Sam.
Scranton's a bit of an oddball.
It seems to run in the family.
So if it's all right with you, I'll bring Leon over to your house at 4:00 so that he can see for himself that the whole thing is utter nonsense.
Well, frankly, Larry, l Because we don't want Leon telling his brother that his million-dollar account is being handled by a man who has an elephant in his living room in living colour.
- Do we?
- No.
No, we certainly don't.
Okay.
Well, I'll see you at 4.
All right, Larry.
See you at 4.
Bye.
Aunt Clara, Larry is bringing the bank president by at 4:00.
Why?
To prove that we do not have an elephant in our living room.
Now, we have to get rid of that elephant or else!
Or else.
- Heave.
- Ho.
- Heave.
- Whoa.
- Heave!
- Ho.
Oh, Aunt Clara, don't stop now.
We have to get it outside.
If we do, there's a chance Mr. Scranton won't see it.
Samantha, now, you have such a flair.
Why don't you, you know, try to get him out to the patio?
Aunt Clara, if I could him out to the patio, I would him back to Africa.
Now, come on.
- Heave!
- Ho.
- Ho!
- "Heave ho".
Now, Mr. Scranton and Tate, I will await without but not without a pink polka-dotted elephant.
Well, we did it!
Did what?
Oh, sometimes, you know, I think you're very vague, dear.
Well, now all I have to do is put you to bed change clothes, fix the refreshments and Oh, well, what's the rush?
I have all of two minutes.
Come on, Tabatha.
Up we go.
Samantha!
Nice elephant.
Nice Oh, please go out and play in the yard.
Oh, nice elephant.
Never mind the music.
Oh, please!
Nice elephant.
Pretty elephant.
Nice eleph Bad elephant.
Oh, really, Aunt Clara.
Why did you let it back in?
I couldn't help it, dear.
He was crashing through the window there and the glass.
And I didn't know if you had it insured.
Aunt Clara Aunt Clara, that's it!
What's it?
That's why he didn't wanna stay out!
He wanted to be with Tabatha.
Oh, yes, well, I knew that from the start.
They're crazy about each other.
Oh, I wonder who that can be.
Oh, I bet it's Mr. Scranton.
Come on.
Let's see if he'll follow Tabatha into the den.
Come on.
Oh, wait Wait a minute!
Wait Wait for me!
Brace yourself, Mr. Scranton.
You are about to see one very pink polka-dotted elephant on the patio.
Leon, this boy needs to be grounded.
You stay there and play quietly, huh?
Now, I'm sure as long as they're both here they'll stay put and there won't be a problem.
Now, Aunt Clara, I want you to go to the park and get that toy.
I don't care how you do it.
Oh, yes, I do.
Absolutely no witchcraft.
- No witchcraft.
- Yes, all right.
Now, hurry.
Yes, I will.
Wait.
Will you just give me a boost?
Oh, why, certainly.
- What's keeping them?
- A pink polka-dotted elephant.
What else?
Refreshments on the patio, and I'll wear my brown dress.
Coming!
- Hi, Larry.
Gentlemen.
- Good afternoon.
Doesn't take you very long to change, does it?
Well, that depends.
Into what?
May I suggest that we dispense with the amenities and go directly to your patio.
Now, hold on, Hawkins.
You're getting a little highhanded.
- I think - No.
That's exactly what I had in mind.
I have some cool drinks for us.
You lead the way, Larry.
This way, gentlemen.
Mr. Hawkins.
You said it was on the patio.
Come on.
Show us where.
What did you do with it?
He's got to be here.
I saw you push him out here.
Push what where?
The elephant.
Maybe he's in the garage.
Congratulations, madam.
Congratulations?
For what?
Well, you've won today's grand prize for having the only toy elephant in the park with polka dots on it.
Twenty dollars for you, dear.
Now may I take the elephant for the prize committee?
- Wait a minute!
- Oh, no, I can't.
I can't, dear.
The contest will be over at 6:00.
Yes.
What is it with that elephant?
It wasn't in the garage but he's here someplace, and I'll find him.
- How far do you wanna go?
- I don't care.
- I smell a rat.
- Oh, come on.
Be consistent.
If you smell anything, smell an elephant.
If he's not out here, then he's somewhere in the house.
Mr. Hawkins, really.
Mr. Hawkins, I must protest.
- Please!
- Where have you got him?
- What?
- I know.
You've got him hidden.
In a closet.
That's what it is.
In a closet.
An elephant in a closet?
Now are you satisfied?
Now I'm satisfied.
That's not an elephant?
Somebody tell me that's not an elephant.
That's not an elephant.
I found it, Mr. Scranton!
I found the elephant and he's every bit as pink and polka-dotted as I said he was.
- All right, Hawkins.
Where?
- In the last place you'd expect, sir.
In the den.
Follow me, please.
Leon, where did you find this joker?
See for yourselves.
He was here.
He was, I saw him!
Why would I say that I saw him if I hadn't?
That is a question for you to ask a qualified psychiatrist.
I couldn't agree more.
Enough is enough.
We haven't looked everywhere.
What about upstairs?
Upstairs?
The kitchen!
We haven't tried the kitchen.
At least let's try the kitchen.
You try the kitchen.
And if you find the elephant, let me know.
- I'll come a-running.
- So will I. There you are!
All right.
I'm letting you know.
You may both come a-running.
The elephant is in the kitchen!
- King is in the counting house.
- Counting out his money.
You don't have to come in, but come a little closer.
Now what do you say?
- What?
!
- I think you've been overworking him.
Well, I won't be overworking him anymore.
Oh, please, Mr. Scranton.
Anyone can make a mistake.
All he needs is a vacation.
Well, I'll think it over.
Right now, I've seen enough.
- I'm sorry to have bothered you.
- Oh, no bother.
- I'll call you, Sam.
- Fine, Larry.
- Coming, Hawkins?
- I'll give him something for his headache, and then he'll go.
Mommy!
Mommy!
Oh, Tabatha.
I thought I told you to stay in the den.
That's That's not an elephant?
Well, actually, it's one of my husband's prize trophies.
He picked it up when he was on a safari in Africa.
Bagged it himself.
I guess he really should have shot it first.
Oh, I hope I'm not too late.
No, of course not, dear.
You've saved the day.
Oh, well, he certainly didn't do anything to help.
What are we going to do if the mother isn't there?
Think positive, Aunt Clara.
Haven't we had enough trouble?
Oh, yes.
My opinion is yes, yes.
There she is.
Thank heaven she's here.
All right, give me the elephant, and I'll return it from here.
No.
Allow me, please.
Yes.
I want to redeem myself.
Well, of course you do, dear.
But be careful.
Yes.
Have no fear.
No fear.
Polka dots and trunks that bend Bring to us a happy end Oh, look.
Oh, Aunt Clara, that Oh, my!
- Shall we make a tactical retreat?
- Yes, yes.
Yes.
Hang Hang on, hang on.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Watch it.
Careful.
I bet I know what you're thinking.
"There must be an easier way".
There is, but it might shake you up a bit.
What?
Here we go.
All set, Johnny.
I sure appreciate this, Mrs. Stephens.
If it weren't for you, I'd have no way to get down to the track and practice.
I'm happy to help, Johnny.
But I still don't see the point of practicing for a race you don't think you'll be able to enter.
I guess it's just my nutty way of hoping against hope.
All right, stand back.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz, what are you doing here?
Me?
I only happen to be the aunt of Flash Kravitz the fastest soapbox-derby racer in the future history of soapbox-derby racing.
Really?
That's wonderful.
He's staying with us until he wins the local races.
Then, naturally, he's going on to win at Akron.
- Naturally.
- What are you doing here?
Oh, I came with my friend, Johnny Mills.
Well, if you don't mind, Mrs. Stephens I wish you wouldn't look at Flash.
Mrs. Kravitz, I'm afraid I don't know what you mean.
Let's just say I'm superstitious.
Which, incidentally, I never was until I met you.
Beat it, kid.
I'm class A, and this is a time trial.
I'm racing against the clock.
It won't hurt anything if I race with you.
In that pile of junk?
Don't make me laugh.
The Gray Goose may not be painted as fancy as yours but I'll beat you to the finish line.
- Not if you had jet engines.
Go back on your skateboard, kid.
I don't race with amateurs.
Flash.
Wait!
You're not gonna let him race with you.
Well, if he wants to eat my dust, that's his hang-up.
It certainly is.
Ready, set go!
Come on, Flash!
Get your weight forward!
Come on!
So as Johnny and I drove home that's when he asked me if I could keep the racer.
Why can't he keep it at home?
Where's he been keeping it?
That's what I wanted to know, but I didn't find out much.
All I know is there's just the boy and his father.
He's the garage man, you know, Mills Auto Service?
- Yeah.
- Well, for some reason Johnny doesn't want his father to know about the racer.
That doesn't make any sense.
Who'd be more interested in his kid's racing car than a garage mechanic?
- You figure it out.
- I don't wanna figure it out.
I don't wanna get involved.
And I don't want you involved either.
- I'm not involved.
- Sam you're helping a 12-year-old deceive his father.
You don't call that "involved"?
Darrin, did you tell your father everything when you were 12?
We're not talking about me.
It's been a long time since I was 12.
- Wanna lick the spoon?
It's chocolate.
- Oh, yeah, I love your chocolate.
Sam, that's not fair.
Well, neither is sitting in judgment on a boy when you don't know the whole story.
Say, have I heard the whole story?
You didn't interfere when the boys were racing, did you?
I told you, they were only practicing.
But you didn't tell me, did you interfere?
Well, if you could call straightening a wobbly wheel interfering I could.
Oh, that must be Johnny, he said he'd be back.
- Would you answer the door?
- We'll continue this discussion later.
Not if I can help it.
- Mr. Stephens?
- You must be Johnny.
Yes, sir.
I came to work on my racer.
- I've got a wheel problem.
- So I've heard.
Come inside a minute, son.
I'd like to talk to you.
Sam, we have a guest.
- Hiya, Johnny.
- Hi, Mrs. Stephens.
Thanks for keeping my car in your garage.
- I was happy to do it.
- Sit down, Johnny.
Think a little piece would spoil your dinner?
I could risk it.
Why don't you want your father to know about the racer?
Oh, lots of reasons.
None of them really very interesting.
Why don't you let us decide that for ourselves.
Well, Dad doesn't know I built the racer.
Tommy Summers let me build it in his garage.
But it was taking up too much room.
That's why I had to ask you.
Why keep the racer a secret?
Your dad's a mechanic, he could've helped you.
The soapbox-derby rules says you gotta build it all by yourself.
And anyway, you don't know my dad.
- He'd have thrown a fit.
- Why?
Well, because Look, my dad's a great guy, about the greatest there is but he's got this thing about me becoming a doctor.
What's building a racer got to do with becoming a doctor?
With my dad, everything has something to do with becoming a doctor.
- You wanna be a doctor?
- Sure, I I guess so.
If it'll make Dad happy.
Mrs. Stephens, I gotta go.
Thanks for the cake.
And thanks again for keeping my car.
Johnny, wait a minute.
- What are you going?
- Good luck, Johnny.
We hope you win the derby and become a doctor.
Thanks.
Mrs. Stephens, I got one other problem.
- Okay.
- You see they won't let me race in the derby unless my parent or guardian signs the application.
- Johnny, we can't sign it for you.
- Oh, I know that.
That'd be illegal.
Anyway, I was going to ask my dad to sign it after I got the racer all built.
Well, the race is on Saturday and I'm kind of scared to ask him.
Would you?
I'll bet he'd have a tough time saying no to you.
- Speaking from experience - Yeah, I'd be willing to give it a try.
Mr. Mills don't you understand, if you don't sign this, Johnny won't be able to race.
- That lousy bolt's frozen.
- He's got a good chance of winning.
And if I don't fix this buggy by 8:00 l've got a good chance of getting the riot act from the guy that owns this car.
Mr. Mills, haven't you got just five minutes to stand up and talk to me?
Look, Mrs. Stephens, you're a very nice lady and a very good customer and I appreciate your business, but my son is my son.
- All right?
- Yes, I know.
The only reason I am asking is because your son is afraid to ask.
How about people.
They see a kid without a mother, and right away they figure they got a right to stick their nose in.
I told you, I gotta get finished with this car.
Is that more important than Johnny?
Look, do you think I like working You know what it costs to send a kid through college and medical school?
Yes.
Yes, I know it's very expensive.
But did you realize that the soapbox-derby finalists win college scholarships?
Well, that's terrific.
If I figured like that, I'd take all the profits from this garage and I'd try to win his tuition in a crap game, you get the same odds.
Mr. Mills, Johnny's racer is already built.
He'd only have to take one afternoon off from his studies.
Surely he can spare that.
This thing won't budge.
It come loose.
Mr. Mills, please?
Please?
All right, all right.
Give him a little encouragement, he thinks a lot of you.
Yeah, that's his trouble.
He thinks too much of a $150-a-week grease monkey.
Will you come watch him race on Saturday?
Boy, give them an inch Lady, on Saturdays I'm up to my ears in work.
You got so much free time, you go watch him race.
All right.
I will.
Mission accomplished.
Johnny, you got time to put these on?
Hey, brand-new regulation wheels!
Now I can pass inspection.
- Thanks, Mr. Stephens.
- It's okay, Johnny.
- You too, Mrs. Stephens.
- Glad to do it.
- Hurry.
Not long before the first race.
- Right.
Look who didn't wanna get involved.
Come here.
- Come on, there are kids around here.
- Yeah.
Too bad, huh?
Get those wheels on, Johnny.
We'll be rooting for you.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Mrs. Stephens, you will watch for my dad, won't you?
I mean, in case he does come.
- Sure, Johnny.
- Contestants for the next heat are Jim Kleinman, Johnny Mills, Don Bellow.
- Come on, Johnny!
- Come on, Johnny.
- Come on, faster!
- Come on, Johnny!
- Oh, come on, Johnny.
Faster!
- Come on, Johnny!
There he goes!
There he goes!
He won!
The winner in class B, Johnny Mills.
- He won!
- I make it 28.7 seconds.
That's good.
I knew he could do it.
I knew he could do it!
Thattaboy, Johnny!
- Oh, there, there, there.
- Figured.
And the winner in class A, Leroy Kravitz.
Looks like he and Johnny will be racing each other.
I think so.
The finals!
Abner, Flash is gonna be in the finals!
In that case, I'll have another hot dog.
The bases are loaded again!
Ladies and gentlemen, the drivers in this final championship heat of the local soapbox derby are Johnny Mills and Leroy Kravitz.
Drivers to the starting line.
Remember now, let him do it on his own.
No funny help.
- Why, Darrin, do you think I'd stoop?
- No.
But you might get excited and lose control.
They blew it.
- Who?
- Who else?
The Mets!
- Come on, Johnny!
Come on!
- Let's go, Johnny!
- Oh, faster.
Faster, Johnny!
- Stay back, Flash!
Come on, Johnny!
Come on!
Oh, he may make it.
Oh, come on!
Faster.
Oh, I promise, witch's honour.
Come on, Johnny.
Johnny!
- Go, Johnny!
Come on!
Faster!
- Go, Johnny!
There you go!
- Come on, Johnny!
- He won!
He won!
Hi, Johnny!
He won!
He won!
The winner, and this year's champion, is Johnny Mills.
See, I told you they were doing something funny.
Okay, so why don't you do something funny?
Like mind your own business, for a change.
This is my business.
And I think it needs further investigation.
Congratulations, Johnny.
Now I can say that I know a local soapbox-derby champion.
Congratulations, champ.
Say, you gave us a bad moment in that last heat.
Attention.
Ladies and gentlemen there'll be a delay before the presentation of the trophies.
Will Johnny Mills and his parents please report to the soapbox-derby headquarters immediately.
I wonder what that's all about.
Hello, Johnny.
I'm Mr. Martin of the derby rules committee.
Are you Mr. And Mrs. Mills?
- No, we're just friends.
- Is anything the matter?
Well, we've had a rather strange complaint from a Mrs. Gladys Kravitz.
Do you know her?
Well, she's I don't like to say this.
- Weird.
She is, isn't she?
And most difficult to cope with.
She has insisted that Johnny here got illegal help in winning this race.
We've got to clear this thing up before we can declare him the winner.
I built the car all by myself.
Honest.
I'm sure you did, son.
And I'm sure you can prove it.
Now, where are your parents?
- Your father did sign the application.
- Yes, sir.
What's the?
What's the nature of the charges?
They, like Mrs. Kravitz, are also weird.
But we're gonna have an informal hearing as soon as we can round up all the judges.
- Now, where is your father, Johnny?
- Well, Mr. Mills was delayed.
He got sick.
He really wanted to come, but he got sick.
Well, he should be here to help answer the charges.
Darrin, why don't you go along with Mr. Martin and Johnny.
I'll phone Mr. Mills and see if he's feeling better.
Don't you worry.
Come along with me.
Come on, Johnny.
Mr. Mills, Johnny needs you.
Johnny never cheated on anything in his life.
Let him tell the judges that.
They'll believe him.
Why should they, when his own father won't come down and stand up for him?
Well, what can I do?
Look, I know it's tough on the kid but there are more important things than soapbox derbies.
Yeah, I agree.
Like a boy who has to say his father's sick because he's too ashamed to admit he isn't interested in going to the race.
He gets a roof over his head three meals a day and a chance to go to college so that he won't have to pump gas for 12 hours a day.
If that ain't good enough, that's just too bad.
Oh, please, Mr. Mills.
It'll only take an hour.
Look, Mrs. Stephens, I got three tires to fix on that one over there.
I have to replace the carburettor in that one and a complete brake reline on that one there.
All before 6:00.
If all those things were done, could you come?
How they gonna get done?
You got a magic wand?
- What's a carburettor look like?
- Mrs. Stephens, please, go away.
- Is it that thing?
- Yeah.
Now, go away.
Okay.
Mr. Mills, is that the car without the tires?
It seems to have them all.
- They was laying on the ground.
- Isn't that a carburettor?
No.
Nobody can hook up one of them things that quick.
Oh, you must have done it this morning and forgot.
You've been awfully busy.
- Did I forget about the brake reline too?
- I don't know.
The heck with it.
Let's go, Mrs. Stephens.
I I better change my clothes.
I can't go looking like a bum.
You look just fine.
Besides, it's a hearing, not a formal dinner party.
Come on.
Come on.
Mrs. Kravitz, can you be a little more specific?
Exactly in what way did Johnny here get illegal help?
Well, you saw the way he was behind in the last heat.
And then he caught up like magic.
And I don't use the word loosely.
How about not using the word at all?
Well, the same peculiar thing happened when he was racing with my Flash and they were just practicing.
What's so peculiar about that?
Drivers often come from behind.
Both times, Samantha Stephens was there.
That's my wife.
She's sort of been coaching Johnny.
She's been doing more than just coaching.
She's always doing more than she should be when she should be doing something.
The things I could tell you The things I could tell you.
Johnny did anyone help you build your car?
No, sir.
Dad!
It's okay, kid.
What'd they say you did?
Mr. Mills, won't you sit down.
We're just trying to make sure that Johnny built his racer himself.
If he says he did, he did.
Look, I'm a mechanic if he didn't ask me for help, why would he ask anyone else?
Now, please, everybody, sit down.
Johnny, can you tell us how you constructed the brake assembly?
Yes, sir.
I used the tools at school.
In wood shop.
I built the car in my friend Tommy's garage.
We had some old tires, so we used a piece of them for the braking surface.
I attached the rod to the front-end plate with an eyebolt.
Then, for the rear housing, I used regular door springs and some hinges.
I had a little bit of trouble getting the regulation 3-inch ground clearance but after I switched the hinge, it was okay.
- Where did you learn all that stuff?
- From you, Pop.
You're the best mechanic in town.
- Can I say something?
- Certainly, Mr. Mills.
My kid never lied about anything in his life except maybe today, when he said that I was sick.
I wasn't sick.
I was stupid.
Well, that's all I wanted to say, but if you wanna make out that my kid didn't win because he got help from somebody you better be able to prove it pretty good.
Thank you, Mr. Mills.
Congratulations, Johnny.
I think we can give you your trophy and your $500 bond right now.
And we also want you to know that we're very proud to have you represent our city in the finals at Akron.
Come on, Abner.
We don't have to listen to this.
We're leaving.
Are you going with him to Akron?
Why should she go with him?
I'm the kid's old man, ain't I?
Lady, how about taking over the station while me and the kid are out of town?
When you show up, things have a way of working and working out.
No, thank you, Mr. Mills.
I'm retiring.
By special request.
Seventy thousand spectators crowded the stands in Akron Oh, darling, isn't it wonderful about Johnny?
I just can't believe it.
It's fantastic.
There were over Well, he won the scholarship, that's the important thing.
No more problems about college.
His father won't have to worry about that now.
There he is!
This year's winner was Johnny Mills.
As the crowd cheers the new champion Johnny was paraded down the track on which, only minutes before he had beaten two other finalists in the championship heat.
Johnny qualified for the all-American derby by beating all other entrants in the local trials of his community.
At the finish line, Johnny was joined by his father who shared in the excitement.
If anybody ever made a boy's dreams come true Well, thank you, darling.
You're pretty good at making a man's dreams come true too.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Ladies and gentlemen this photograph of the moon's surface was tak en two months ago by a camera aboard an unmanned space capsule.
Today, space technicians at the Cape are hopeful that this view of the moon, and even closer ones will be seen for the first time by human eyes.
Sam, not now.
I'm watching the moon probe.
- What?
- I'm watching the moon probe.
When you turn the vacuum on, the set goes flooey.
I can't see!
I can't see.
Can't you do that later?
I've been waiting for weeks to give the house a thorough cleaning.
These rugs are filthy.
How can you worry about the dirt on the rugs when we're about to see the surface of the moon?
The moon could use a vacuuming too, all that dust.
We have now received word from the Cape that the orbit and attitude of the space capsule are perfect.
In a matter of hours, astronauts aboard the spacecraft will have the closest view of the moon ever seen by the nak ed eye, thus bringing nearer the day when men will actually land on the moon.
Honey, why don't you forget about the housework.
Watch this with me.
It's interesting even for a sophisticated witch like you.
Well, I'd like to, darling, but I just can't.
It's like having a ringside seat for the discovery of America.
- Aren't you interested?
- Well, certainly I'm interested.
But it's the same elliptical orbit, isn't it?
Except this time the pilots will see for themselves the mile-high dust drifts and the lunar craters.
I am more interested in getting the refrigerator straightened out the oven scrubbed, the attic cleaned and the rugs vacuumed.
Anyway l've seen the moon.
She's seen the moon.
She's seen the moon?
No, that's impossible.
With her, nothing's impossible.
Larry, I'd like to ask you something.
Is it more important than Jack Nicklaus getting an eagle on a 550-yard 5-par?
- What do you think about the moon?
- I think it's very nice.
Easy, now.
Stroke it easy.
You've got a downhill lie.
- I mean, about getting there.
- You really want to know what I think?
Okay, I'll tell you what I think.
I think that the moon is very important.
But I wish they'd stop spending my money to get there.
Oh, come on, Lar.
Be serious.
I am serious.
Do you realize how big my tax bill is going to be this year?
Larry, it's for the advancement of science.
- New frontiers, progress.
- Don't get me wrong.
If they could say "alakazam," snap their fingers and get there, I'd be for it.
Well, that's close.
- What?
- Nothing.
I say forget it.
Larry, I know this is going to sound ridiculous but just suppose someone knew of a way of getting to the moon without spending all that money.
What do you think he should do about it?
He should go down to the authorities, tell them what he knows.
I think it would be his patriotic duty.
That's what I was afraid you'd say.
But before he does it, I'll tell you what I think he should do.
I think he should go home, take a good, stiff drink a couple of aspirin and try to get some sleep.
Well, Larry, it was just a hypothetical question.
Of course it was.
Furthermore I don't think this person should come to work tomorrow until he's gotten all this stupid nonsense out of his skull!
Well, I really got a rise out of you, didn't I?
I was just putting you on.
Samantha, it's getting harder and harder to tell the difference between you and an ordinary household drudge.
Well, I'm sorry, Mother, but as long as you insist upon popping in unannounced, you'll just have to take me as I am.
I must say, I can't see where I went wrong.
I brought you up as a proper witch taught you the best incantations.
And here you are, married to a mortal doing the most menial tasks.
A fallen woman.
All right, Mother, out with it.
What's on your mind?
I want you to come shopping with me.
That's what this is about, to get me to come shopping with you.
Well, if I'd simply invited you, Samantha, you'd have refused.
I'm afraid I have to anyway.
I can't leave Tabatha.
Well, I've already installed Hagatha upstairs to babysit.
- Mother, I have to clean the house.
- Good.
Now, let's compromise.
I'll let you clean the house as a drudge but only after you come shopping with me.
Well, all right.
But we mustn't be gone more than two hours.
Now, promise.
Marvellous.
We better change, dear.
Mother, wait a minute.
Where are we going?
It's Sunday.
All the stores are closed.
Not where I'm taking you.
Follow me.
Nice of you to pop in, ladies.
Oh, Mother.
You didn't tell me we were going to Tokyo.
I'll never trust you again.
Darling, you said yourself the shops were all closed back home.
Here it isn't Sunday.
We've just crossed the International Date Line.
I am so happy to see you again.
- This is my daughter, Samantha.
- How do you do?
I am honoured to make your acquaintance, Samantha-san.
Your mother and I have been long-time friends.
I've just come for some of your marvellous tea, Watanabe-san.
Of course.
Just a moment, please.
I keep in back for my special customers.
- He's a warlock?
- Tokyo chapter.
And his tea is absolutely out of this world.
After this, we'll go to a marvellous restaurant.
They make the most divine squid mousse.
Well, I guess I should be going home.
I'll see you at the office tomorrow.
- Darrin?
- What?
That's the closet.
Well, there's nothing like a little trip to Japan to break up the morning.
Now, just let us relax and have a cup of this marvellous warlock tea.
Mother, dear, you are incorrigible.
Now, we've been gone all day, and now you want me to sit down and have tea.
I have to get the house clean.
What am I gonna tell Darrin?
Well, tell him our rickshaw got caught in a traffic jam.
I'm certainly not going to mention Japan.
Then don't.
Do you have to give a schedule of where you've been every day, minute by minute?
Well, of course not.
It's a Look, if I don't get started with the cleaning, I'll never get done.
You're welcome to stay.
And watch you do battle with grease and grime?
No, thank you.
Well, ta-ta, darling.
Enjoy your tea.
Now the vacuuming and the attic.
Oh, I'll never make it.
Vacuum cleaner, I have a problem.
I can spend four hours pushing you around and cleaning the attic in which case I won't have any time to spend with Darrin or I can well, you know, get it all done in a flash and relax for the rest of the afternoon with my husband.
What do you think?
Should I or shouldn't I?
Well, I thought you'd agree.
Now that dusty old attic.
- Sam, I'm home.
- I'll be right there.
Are you still vacuuming?
Now, that's what I call really automatic.
Sam?
Sam.
I thought we agreed that housework was to be done in the usual manner.
Oh, I must have left the motor on.
You also must have left detailed instructions.
- What happened to you?
- I've been upstairs cleaning the attic.
It's very dirty up there, see?
Did you clean the attic like you were vacuuming the rug?
Oh, Darrin, really.
I just wanted us to have some time together and I thought I wouldn't be finished in time, so A little: Yes, just a little.
By the way, where have you been?
I called you from Larry's.
Why are you questioning me like this?
I'm not questioning you.
I just wanna know what you did while I was gone.
- Minute by minute?
- Any way you like.
Well, let's see.
First, I cleaned the left side of the refrigerator.
- Then I cleaned the right side.
- Sam.
You're deliberately not answering my question.
I do not like being cross-examined by my husband.
- What?
What?
What is that?
- What's what?
- That, that.
- Oh, this?
- That's Yeah.
- Nothing.
Do you usually wrap nothing in white tissue paper?
Darrin, Mother came over and we went out to lunch at a nice little Japanese tearoom.
And that's the last question I'm going to answer until you apologize.
Sam, please.
One more question.
Where did you go?
- You want to know where I went?
- Yes.
All right, I'll tell you.
To the moon.
And one of these days To the moon.
How are you, Mr. Stephens?
What will it be today?
Heartburn, headaches, lower-back pains, nasal congestion?
You name it, I can fix it.
It's nothing like that.
I wanna ask a favour.
Well could you analyse these?
Analyse?
What kind of analyse?
Look, Mr. Stephens.
I'm a druggist, not a chemical engineer.
If I was a chemist, would I be open on Sunday afternoon?
That's the point.
The laboratories are closed and I want to find out what this stuff is as soon as possible.
It It's a matter of national importance.
Looks like dust.
It looks like dust.
I want you to find out what that really is.
You mean, you might be allergic?
Oh, that's right, Mr. Grand.
I'm afraid I'm allergic.
And this, by you, is of national importance?
Mr. Grand, just find out what it is.
And this one That's supposed to be tea.
You're a good customer, Mr. Stephens.
I'll see what I can do.
But I don't promise anything this afternoon.
My wife's brother's coming from out of town and to my wife, he's of national importance.
So I'm closing the store an hour earlier.
As soon as you can.
I'll be by in the morning.
And thank you, Mr. Grand.
"Darrin since you insist on knowing where I am every minute Tabatha and I went to the market to pick up a few things for dinner.
Any further questions will have to wait until we get home.
Sam".
It's terrible.
Terrible.
I feel like a stool pigeon an informer.
Spying on my own wife.
What happens if that stuff actually turns out to be from the moon?
What do I do then?
Report it to NASA?
Of course, you know we don't waste time here at NASA.
We're in a race to the moon with the Russians.
We're gonna win, right?
- Right, Ed.
- Look, I can't I can't give you these unless you promise not to ask where I got them.
- What is this, Stephens, conditions when the prestige of our country is involved?
I can't reveal my s I cannot reveal my sources.
Unless you agree, no deal.
Mr. Stephens, why should we want to pry into your private affairs?
- Why, that's ridiculous, isn't it, Ed?
- Of course, ridiculous.
Now, Mr. Stephens, what's in the envelopes?
Well, it looks like house dust and tea, but l House dust and tea, huh?
We'll find out about that.
- Run them through the lab, Frank.
- Right, Ed.
Moon dust and lunar tea.
All right, Stephens, that's it.
Where'd you get it?
- I can't tell you.
- Cut the jazz, Stephens.
You're in serious trouble.
- Where'd you get it?
- I won't tell you.
- Who gave it to you?
- No one.
- Does anybody else know about this?
- No.
You're lying.
What did you tell him?
I said it was his patriotic duty to go to the authorities and tell them everything he knew.
- Tell them, Darrin.
- I can't.
They won't let me watch the golf tournament if you don't tell them.
Don't try to worm out of this.
We know all about you, Stephens.
We have an account of your activities, hour by hour.
Listen, I'm just a simple neighbourhood druggist who has to stay open Sunday afternoons.
Never mind about that.
What about him?
Oh, such a nice man.
Lovely wife, an adorable daughter.
Funny name, though.
Who could know that he was a spy?
Your wife, what does she know about this?
Nothing.
I swear she knows nothing about it.
Then where did you get it?
I refuse to answer on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate she.
Me.
She is involved.
Bring her in, Frank.
- Right, Ed.
- No!
All right, Stephens, who's this woman?
- I never saw her before in my life.
- Next.
How about this one?
Her, I've seen.
Oh, Darrin, how could you?
What's going to become of Tabatha?
Sam, I'm sorry.
I tried to protect you, but they wormed it out of me.
We were only gone for a little while.
Mother wanted to get some tea.
You see?
You wouldn't listen to me.
That's what comes of marrying a mortal.
They're so nosy and suspicious.
Always wanting to know what you're going to do every minute of the day.
You're right, Mother.
You're absolutely right.
I must admit it.
He was suspicious.
He did ask questions.
- No.
No!
- Yes, yes!
All right, Mrs. Stephens, it's time.
Come along, Mrs. Stephens, it's time.
Oh, no, no.
Not yet, please.
Just one more minute.
NASA can't wait, Mrs. Stephens.
We're in a race.
It's time.
Leave her alone!
It's my fault!
For once, you're right, Dagwood.
It is your fault.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin.
Darrin.
Darrin It's all my fault.
No, no!
Darrin.
Darrin, wake up.
Darrin.
Oh, Sam.
Sam!
You're You're here.
- They didn't take you.
- Who?
- The NASA men.
- NASA men?
That's a new one.
Is it anything like bogeyman?
Oh, relax, sweetheart.
You just had a bad dream.
- Well, yeah.
Where's Tabatha?
- She's upstairs, asleep.
- What were you dreaming about?
- Well, the NASA men.
The space agency.
They were giving me the third degree about where did I get the moon dust.
- Moon dust?
- Yeah.
And your mother was there, and Larry Tate was there, and Grand - Grand!
- What's grand?
Max Grand, the druggist.
I gave him the dust and the tea to be analysed.
Sam, why did you go to the moon, especially after we just talked about it?
- Darrin, are you sure you're awake?
- Come on, Sam.
While I was at Larry Tate's this morning you and your mother went to the moon.
When you came back you were covered with moon dust and had that package of lunar tea.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
And when I came back When I came back and I said: "Samantha, where have you been"?
Did you not say, and I quote: "To the moon"?
Darrin, if I told you I'd been to the North Star, would you believe me?
- I was only kidding.
- Sam, when any other woman says: "I've been to the moon," you figure it's a figure of speech.
When you say, "I've been to the moon," that's something else altogether.
When I saw that dust, I knew you'd been to the moon.
Mother came by and she insisted I go shopping with her.
Shop?
Sam.
It's Sunday.
All the stores are closed.
Not in Japan.
In Japan, it's Monday.
And that's where we went, and that's all there is to it.
Japan?
Are you asking me to believe that?
You believe I went to the moon, and you don't believe I went to Japan?
You said you went to the moon.
Only because I was so annoyed at you for asking so many silly questions.
Then you haven't been to the moon?
Not recently, no.
Sam.
I swear and affirm that I have not left the Earth today.
Really?
- "Really" really?
- "Really" really.
Oh, darling, that's marvellous.
I don't even feel so bad about being such a fool with Mr. Grand.
Imagine, giving him ordinary house dust to analyse.
- I bet he thinks you're spooky.
- Yeah.
Ordinary house dust and ordinary Japanese tea.
Darrin.
Darrin, it isn't ordinary Japanese tea.
What?
What is it, then?
It's It's warlock tea.
It's warlock tea.
It's warlock tea!
- Oh, Sam!
- Well, Darrin Mr. Grand is gonna analyse it and he's going to think I don't know what.
Well, I don't think there's anything to worry about.
He'll just think it's something he's never seen before and that'll be the end of that.
- Yeah.
I hope you're right.
I don't think you're right.
Hello?
Mr. Stephens, about that matter of national importance the stuff that looks like house dust?
It is house dust.
No microfilm, no nothing.
Just house dust.
Well, thank you for your trouble, Mr. Grand.
But that other stuff, the stuff that looks like tea That was a mistake.
That is tea.
That's where you're wrong.
I put it through every test I've got.
And there's something in it that is definitely not tea.
I even showed it to my brother-in-law, the one from Nassau.
NASA?
Your brother-in-law's from NASA?
Yeah.
He's visiting us for the weekend with the kids.
Mr. Grand, don't do another thing.
Just forget it.
You've gone to enough trouble.
No trouble at all.
Look, we've got to pass your place on our way home.
We'll drop it off.
See you in a few minutes.
Mr. Grand Sam, I wish you'd go upstairs and let me handle this.
Well, no.
I think it'll sound more logical coming from me.
- Keep your fingers crossed.
- They are.
Mr. Grand, I want to apologize for causing you so much trouble especially since it was all an accident.
My mother's always been fond of home remedies.
You know how old-fashioned some mothers can be.
When she discovered that Darrin was allergic to dust she just had to give him one of her favourite home remedies.
She said it was some special kind of tea.
But Darrin's always been suspicious of home remedies.
That's why he gave it to you to analyse.
Well, it turns out that it's not tea at all.
No, no.
I talked to Mother, and she admitted that it was a special blend of herbs and spices that she got from a Japanese herbalist.
Now, I know they do come up with some strange concoctions.
- Lady.
- Yes?
This stuff is more than strange.
Hey, what happened?
There's no wind tonight.
Oh, it does come up suddenly sometimes, doesn't it?
Oh, what a shame.
That was the last of it, too.
Mr. And Mrs. Stephens, I want you to meet my brother-in-law Harry Kahn, from Nassau.
- Hello.
How do you do.
You mean you don't have more of this?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid you'll just have to go back and tell them at the space agency.
What space agency?
I own a string of cut-rate drugstores.
You mean you're not from NASA?
Sure.
Nassau County, Long Island.
What's the matter with him?
Oh, it must be his allergy.
Night air.
Very bad, you know.
Thank you so much, Mr. Grand.
Mr. Kahn, it was nice meeting you.
- Good night.
- Yes, nice meeting - Darrin, are you all right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.
Come on.
I'll fix you a nice cup of tea.
No!
No tea.
But how about a moonlight cocktail?
Darrin?
Come look at the lady in the moon.
What moon?
Besides, it's a man in the moon.
How do you know it's a man?
Everybody knows it's a man.
Just look at it.
Could be a lady.
You know, I've been meaning to ask you something.
You said that you hadn't been to the moon today but you didn't say that you'd never been to the moon.
Well, have you?
- Have I what?
- Been to the moon ever?
Darrin, you don't want to know everything about me, do you?
I mean, there are some things a wife should not tell a husband.
And whether or not she has been to the moon is one of them.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Oh, we're going to have such fun.
Oh, I just can't wait.
Now I got all these buttons buttoned Hello, you exquisite, brilliant, charming, perfect little witch-let.
- Hello, Samantha.
- Hello, Mother.
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Where are you going?
Tabatha and I are going to see Hoho the Clown.
Who, what, and why is Hoho the Clown?
That's your granddaughter's favourite television show.
Darrin's agency represents the sponsor and he gave us tickets to see it in person, so we're go Oh, dear.
Where did I put them?
Samantha, I'm surprised at you.
Taking a child of Tabatha's breeding to a kiddie show?
A ballet, yes.
A drama by Shakespeare, perhaps.
But that ho-ho, hee-hee, ha business Oh, no.
Now, if you prefer something in a lighter vein well, we could pop over to Paris and ride up the River Seine in a bateau-mouche.
Maybe some other time.
We have a previous engagement.
Oh, and I just flew over from Edinburgh to play with my little granddaughter.
Well, I'm sorry, mother but Tabatha and I are going to see Hoho the Clown.
Well, very well.
I'll go with you.
Well, mother, you'd hate every minute of it.
Now, can you see yourself sitting for an hour surrounded by children?
Yes.
I always enjoy seeing how inferior other children are to my Tabby-Tabby-Tabbykins.
Besides, we only have two tickets.
Count again.
- Mother.
- Yes, dear?
You're a stubborn woman.
You're a good ticket-zapper, but you're a stubborn woman.
You sure Richard Burton started like this?
Is that Hobo the Clown?
Not Hobo, Mother, Hoho.
- When is he going to be funny?
- In a minute, when the show starts.
Hi, it's Hoho the Clown!
Brought to you five times a week, Monday through Friday by the Solow Toy Company.
Take it from Hoho, buy Solow.
Hey.
Oh, he's revolting.
And now, boys and girls, ho, ho, ho, ho on with the show-ho do-ho.
Darrin, I want you to read this memo I received from What are you doing?
I'm watching Hoho the Clown.
Now, that's what I call loyalty to the client.
I've tried to watch, but every time I hear "ho, ho, ho" I wanna punch him right in the no-no-nose.
There they are.
There they are on television!
- There who are?
- My wife, daughter and mother-in-law.
How did my mother-in-law get there?
Ho, ho, ho!
It's me again.
And guess what I got.
I got balloons!
Ho, ho.
I got I got lots of balloons.
Balloons for everybody.
And here.
I got a balloon for you.
Isn't that nice?
Ho, ho!
And I got another balloon for you.
And I got a balloon for you.
There's one.
Here's one for you.
And I got a balloon for you.
Ho, ho!
And I got a balloon for you.
And a balloon for you.
Ho, ho, ho.
And here's one for you.
And here's one for you.
Ho, ho!
And here's one for you.
And here's another one for you.
And for you.
- Why didn't he give Tabatha a balloon?
- Mother, we're on television.
She's obviously the most outstanding child in this entire audience.
And now does anybody know what time it is?
That's right.
It's time for the Hoho hope chest!
And the Hoho hope chest is chock-full of lots and lots of toys and games!
Manufactured by the Solow Toy Company.
Now, every boy and girl has a Hoho the Clown badge with a number on it.
And in just 60 seconds one of those numbers is gonna be the lucky number that wins all of the prizes in the Hoho hope chest.
And now, boys and girls, it's time for an exciting message from the Solow Toy Company.
- Where's Tabatha's badge?
- Oh, she doesn't have one.
- Why not?
Because she's related to Darrin.
Well, I admit, that's a mark against her, but it's hardly her fault.
I mean because Darrin's connected with the show she's not eligible for the hope chest.
- Who says so?
- Oh, it's an established policy.
I think it's very unfair.
They have no right to penalize my granddaughter.
They're not penalizing her, Mother.
I told you.
Well, I don't care.
She'll be very disappointed.
No, she won't.
Now, stop it.
Stop making something out of nothing.
Oh, hi there.
It's me again.
And now, is everybody ready to see who won all the prizes in the Hoho hope chest?
So I "ho-fully" mix up the numbers and we pick a winner!
And the winning number is twelve.
Here!
Right over here!
This little girl right here.
Mother!
Your child shouldn't win the Hoho hope chest.
I know.
I guess the program staff goofed.
Yeah, I guess the program staff goofed.
- I guess the program staff goofed.
- Come on, Sam.
I know it was your mother, you know it was your mother.
- I guess it was my mother.
- As usual, she's out to destroy me.
Oh, Darrin, she's not out to destroy you.
- She was simply being a - A fun-loving witch?
Well, yes.
And a doting grandmother.
When you tell Larry that as soon as the show went off the air I found the producer and asked to give the toys to charity there'll be no repercussions.
Because we did not take the Hoho hope chest ho-ho-home.
- I hope you're right.
- Oh, I know I'm right.
The incident is closed.
- You're kidding.
- No, I'm afraid I'm deadly serious.
If the little girl who won yesterday's hope chest is not in today's studio audience, I refuse to go on.
- Why?
- Because I like her.
Well, Hoho, this isn't logical.
- Doesn't have to be logical.
- Well, why not?
Because I'm a star.
Darrin, we have an emergency.
I just got a call from the producer of Hoho the Clown.
- And?
- Hoho refuses to work unless, quote "That cute little doll," unquote that won yesterday's Hoho hope chest is in today's studio audience.
- You mean Tabatha?
- No Tabatha, no show.
No show, no commercials.
No commercials, no client.
What is it?
Some kind of a practical joke to amuse my ulcer?
This is the first time I've heard of it.
Honestly.
I tell you You have no time to tell me anything.
Just have Sam get Tabatha over to the studio immediately as a personal favour to the president of the company.
You want some milk?
Thank you.
Hello?
Why?
Because Hoho the Clown refuses to go on unless she's there.
Oh, no.
Darrin, you know what I think?
I think Mother did more than monkey around with Hoho's hope chest.
I think she monkeyed around with Hoho himself.
- What's she saying?
- Well, nothing.
She's She's My suggestion is to let Hoho not go on.
If he's under one of Mother's spells I can't vouch for what might happen.
- Is she giving you a hard time?
- Oh, not exactly, Larry.
She suggests that Sam, this is Larry.
Will you please bring Tabatha over to the studio immediately?
Or I'll send Darrin home immediately, unemployed.
Goodbye.
Now that that's settled, let's you and I go over to the studio and see what this monkey business is all about.
Mother!
Mother?
Oh, goodness.
Tabatha, you and I have got to go somewhere.
That's a little fast for you, huh?
But, Samantha, you're a witch!
If Endora put a spell on Hoho, are you sure you can't snap him out of it?
Positive.
She has to do it.
There's a long, technical explanation but what it boils down to is that if a licensed witch puts a spell on someone she has squatter's rights to him.
- Oh, boy.
You better sit down.
- Oh, aren't you gonna sit with us?
- I'm gonna sit with Larry in the booth.
- All right.
- See you later.
- Yeah.
- Hi, Hoho.
- Hi, sweetie.
Hello, Tate.
Oh, Mr. Solow.
What a pleasant surprise.
What brings you here?
I come every Friday to make sure you're giving me my money's worth.
Darrin, Mr. Solow owner of the Solow Toy Company.
May I present one of McMann & Tate's most creative young executives, Darrin Stephens.
- How do you do, sir?
- Likewise.
Let's watch Hoho the Clown.
Ho, ho, ho!
I'm Hoho the Clown.
Brought to you five days a week, Monday through Friday by the Solow Toy Company.
Take it from Hoho, buy a Solow!
Boys and girls, we're gonna change our format today.
Instead of doing the show for the entire audience we're gonna play it to just one member.
And where is she?
There she is.
Oh, Mr. Cameraman would you get a shot of this cute little doll sitting on her mother's lap?
Darrin, did you change the format?
No.
I wouldn't do that without your approval.
I liked the format the way it was.
Oh, isn't she pretty?
Oh, don't touch Hoho's nose.
You know why?
I'm gonna make sure that you win all the prizes.
You're gonna win all the prizes from the Hoho hope chest and all of the other prizes too.
Nobody else is gonna win anything.
He can't give all the prizes to one kid!
It's un-American.
Who is she?
Who is that kid that's ruining my program?
And now, boys and girls, ho, ho, ho, ho on with the show-ho do-ho!
- I have no idea.
- Do you, Darrin?
- No.
No, I never saw her before in my life.
- Darrin?
- What?
It's Saturday.
Instead of sitting inside why don't you go out and get some fresh air?
Good idea.
I'll take a walk in the traffic.
With any kind of luck, the headline will read: "Death Comes to the Father of Girlfriend of Hoho the Clown".
Darrin.
I have an idea.
After Tabatha wakes up, why don't we take her to Kiddieland?
Why, so she can hand out autographs as a TV star?
Well, she'd hardly be famous as the result of one television show.
Don't count on it.
The complaints must be pouring in.
When they discover Tabatha is my daughter they'll think the show was rigged, leading to an investigation where I'll decline to answer questions on the grounds that my wife and my mother-in-law are witches.
Okay.
If you don't feel like Kiddieland, let's go to the zoo.
- Samantha.
- Well.
Sam, I wanna talk to your mother!
So do I. So do I. I've been calling her and calling her and she will not answer.
Maybe she went away for the weekend.
- Would you like me to look for her?
- Please.
Her two favourite cities are Paris and Rome.
I'll try Paris first.
- She wasn't in Paris.
- What took you so long?
I couldn't find a cab.
Now I'll try Rome.
You wait right there.
Where else would I go?
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Oh, you saw Tabatha on the Hoho the Clown show.
Yeah.
She was kind of cute, wasn't she?
You want me to get you on the Build Your Castle show?
Because you need a refrigerator and a rotisserie?
You want me to put in the fix for you on the Build Your Castle show the way I did for Tabatha on Hoho?
Mrs. Kravitz, I did not put in the fix for Tabatha on the Hoho show!
I have never put in the fix on any show that I've been connected with.
I think I'll go take another look around the Colosseum.
Samantha, come back here!
She went back to Rome.
To roam around the house again.
Mrs. Kravitz, I'm afraid there's some mistake.
Any show I've been connected with has been on the up-and-up.
If you want a refrigerator and a rotisserie, you'll just have to buy one.
Samantha!
- Yes?
- That is the kind of thing I'm in for.
Mother!
Mother!
- Mrs. Stephens?
- Yes.
I'm Hoho the Clown.
I got your name and address from my producer.
How's your daughter?
Oh, she's just fine, thank you.
You look different without makeup.
I know.
Oh, well, you can't be on all the time.
- Who's your friend?
- Oh, she's a present for my cute little doll!
Where is she?
Oh, hi there, Mr. Stephens, sweetie!
- How's your daughter?
- Oh, she's fine.
- What's with the pony?
- A present for my cute little doll!
- Would you hold her, please?
- Is she housebroken?
For what she cost me, she should be.
I used the money that I laid aside for my wife's birthday present.
- Why?
- Beats me.
For some reason or other, your kid has gotten under my skin.
I can't stop thinking about her.
It's like I'm in her power.
- You're not in her power.
You're in - Darrin.
These are for her too.
And this too.
Where is she?
I'm longing to be near her.
Darrin, why don't you go upstairs and get Tabatha?
I'll take the pony outside.
Come on.
I'm gonna see her.
I'm gonna see my cute little doll.
Mother!
Mother, I wanna see you.
Mother, if you don't come here right this second l'll never let you see Tabatha again.
Samantha, I'm surprised at you.
Stooping to blackmail.
- Where have you been?
- Spending the weekend in Mexico City.
Well, I never would have looked there.
- Care for a bite of taco, dear?
- No.
Mother, I'm very annoyed with you.
About what?
Darwin needs a haircut.
I am in no mood for any of your jokes.
I am annoyed with you because of what you did to Hoho the Clown.
Oh, that.
Hasn't it worn off?
Worn off?
It's worse.
He's in there.
Now, I want you to take that spell off without any further ado.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm getting back to Mexico City.
I'm lunching with a very handsome bullfighter.
Here she is, Hoho.
Here's your cute little doll.
What's so cute?
You've seen one kid, you've seen them all.
Did I bring a pony in here?
Where's my pony?
- It just happened to - What happened?
- Well, l - Here, honey.
Excuse me, Hoho.
It's your daughter.
I hired a detective, and he found out it's your daughter.
When Mr. Solow called me and told me, I was shocked beyond belief.
I couldn't speak.
Words failed me.
Look who's here.
Hi, sponsor, baby.
Ho, ho, ho.
Don't "ho, ho" me, you ingrate.
You and Stephens have a conspiracy to drive the company out of business.
After all I've done for you.
As close as we've been, like father and son.
Darrin, if you needed money, if you needed toys why didn't you come to me?
Larry, are you trying to say that you knew nothing about this?
Yes.
Effective immediately, the Hoho the Clown program is hereby cancelled.
You can't do that to the children of America.
You have no alternative.
And I have no alternative but to ask you to tender your resignation.
Darrin, you're through.
So is my account with McMann & Tate.
Mr. Solow.
That won't be necessary.
Stephens is no longer with the agency.
I want you to know I consider his actions illegal, unethical, shocking - Sam, what did you do?
- I had to do something.
I froze them so you and I can discuss how to get out of this.
- Is the spell off Hoho?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Now we just have to figure out a way to bail him and you out.
Let's see.
We can say We can sa We can say it's a publicity stunt.
- A publicity stunt!
- Yeah.
For what?
For a cute little doll.
- They look like twins.
- Well, thank you.
Now I have to make Hoho believe he was all part of it.
- Honey, what do I say?
- Well, let's see.
Well, I'll start the ball rolling, then you take over and run with it.
Oh, hold it.
- Disgusting, despicable and humiliating.
Mr. Solow, my husband would like you to meet the newest member of the Solow family.
The Tabatha doll.
- The what?
- The Tabatha doll.
Darrin thought of it, and I designed it in my spare time, using our daughter as the model.
Then Hoho put the real Tabatha on television and played favourites to create public interest.
It was a publicity stunt to promote a new product.
Yeah, and I went along with it just to help out the sponsor even though it temporarily hurt my image.
Well, why wasn't I consulted?
- Well, because - Tate?
- Yes, sir?
- Shut up.
You know something?
This is a pretty cute little doll.
And that was a pretty cute publicity stunt.
And these are two pretty clever fellas, huh?
They sure are.
And, Tate?
- Yes, sir?
- You were gonna fire him.
- Me, sir?
- Tate, I think you should offer your apologies, and include Mrs. Stephens.
I think she's pretty clever too.
- Hi, darling.
- Hi, sweetheart.
What are you doing home so early?
I sneaked away to watch Hoho the Clown with you.
Well, isn't that nice?
Is he gonna reveal the publicity stunt?
He's going to say, "In the interest of fair play every loyal viewer who called or wrote to complain will receive, absolutely free, a brand-new Tabatha doll".
Tabatha.
Oh, quick.
Come here.
Just sit down.
Come on.
Sit, like I told you.
If you're gonna watch it, you have to sit.
Ho, ho, ho!
I'm Hoho the Clown!
All you wonderful booers will be happy to know that every one of you will receive a new Tabatha doll absolutely free.
You know, that's rather a cute idea.
Whose was it?
Larry's.
Although I persuaded Mr. Solow to keep his account with us.
Hey, why is Hoho's picture: And mine is: Darling - Well?
- I don't know.
- I fixed it this morning.
- Well, I'll just fix it again.
Hello, Durwood.
Sam, about your mother Well, Darrin, I didn't know any Not in front of the baby.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- Voilà.
- Hey, strawberry waffles.
In honour of this historic occasion.
Just because Larry gave me a day off is no reason to get historical.
Well, go ahead, say what you want but to me this is a day to remember, a day of significance.
You know what I think the significance is?
He's going to ask me to work the weekend.
Well, live.
For tomorrow, you work.
Samantha, what have I done to deserve you?
Nothing.
- And you don't.
- Mother.
- I better run, I'll be late for the office.
- Wait a minute now.
Now, let me explain.
Mother, Darrin's off today.
I think you're just noticing it for the first time.
Sweetheart, why don't you go into the living room and relax?
Sure.
Mother, just once, can't you be nice to Darrin?
Go ahead.
Take the first step.
You'll find out that being nice really isn't so painful.
- All right.
- Good.
Darwood, dear boy, I think it's time we had a talk.
About what?
I mean, I think we should have a better understanding.
I just want to bury the hatchet.
Where?
Oh, isn't that a darling.
No, it's a Reactor Mach II.
Tell me, would you like to have a car like this?
Sure, but even if I could afford it, it's not on the market yet.
Really?
Then close your eyes and hold out your hand.
- What's that?
- The keys to the car you wanted.
Come on, charm boy.
Let's go see, huh?
Come on.
Come on.
- Morning, Charlie.
- Hiya, Joe.
J.J. Just stopped me.
Told me the Reactor Mach II has to be ready for the trial run next Monday.
- A week ought to do it.
- Rough night?
Had a crazy nightmare.
I dreamt we had the trial run.
And we opened the hood to let the reporters see it.
- The engine was gone.
- No.
The whole thing was powered by a bunch of squirrels.
Squirrels?
Oh, that's a riot.
Get the hood up, Charlie.
We'll see if we can't adjust some of those squirrels.
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah.
I think I'm having another nightmare.
The car is gone.
Sam, isn't that wild?
Your mother made an exact copy of the Reactor Mach II.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It makes the Batmobile look like a skateboard.
- And it's got a flip-top roof.
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Electric doors.
How about that?
- Yes, how about that?
Darrin, don't you think you should thank?
Oh, listen to that power plant.
- Must be a gold mine under that hood.
- I hope so.
- Hydraulic suspension system.
- Yeah.
And look at that control panel.
It's even got a radar screen.
I don't think I can bear all this enthusiasm.
See you later, dear.
Darrin, you really should have thanked Mother for the car.
Well, I know I should have, except for one thing.
- What's that?
- I can't take it.
Why not?
You know I can't accept anything that's a product of witchcraft.
But Mother was only being nice.
I know.
Would you look at that steering system.
Darrin, couldn't you make one little exception?
If you make one exception, before you know it, you'll make more.
Couldn't you keep it just for a little while?
Would you look at that power plant.
Don't you realize how hurt Mother's going to be if you don't keep it?
Honey, it's a matter of principle.
Look, if you'd just accept the car graciously maybe she'd stop bugging you.
- She will?
- It's worth a try.
Okay, I'll take it, but only for a little while.
And remember, I'm only doing this for your mother.
Just calm down, Charlie, and go over this step by step.
- We know the place was locked, right?
- Right.
- We're the only ones with keys, right?
- Right.
Well, there's your answer.
No one could possibly have gotten in.
You're talking nonsense.
The car is gone, isn't it?
- Is it?
- What?
I don't know about you, Charlie, but I am too old to take up another trade.
Do you wanna tell J.J.
That $150,000 worth of car is missing?
And five years of research?
Not until we've gone over the whole thing step by step.
Now, we both know the place was locked, right?
Now, how am I on that side?
- About two feet away.
- That's close enough.
It handles like a dream.
I can't wait to get her out on the highway.
- It does ride beautifully.
- Like to get behind the wheel?
- The steering column?
- Oh, may I?
Of course.
Hon, you better take off your shoes.
- Take off my shoes?
- Your high heels will ruin the carpet.
- I'm not wearing high heels.
- Oh, here.
- Okay?
- Yeah.
- What are you doing?
- Starting the car.
- What for?
- So I can drive it.
Are you kidding?
I said you could get behind the wheel, but that's all.
- You're never gonna let me drive it?
- Oh, sure.
After I've broken it in.
After the first 10,000 miles or so.
Do we still have my old Army blankets?
What for?
I could put them around the walls of the garage, protect the finish.
- I have a better idea.
- What?
Why don't I make a slipcover for it?
What kind of material?
Oh, boy.
I can't wait to tell Larry about this car.
He'll turn green with envy.
Isn't he gonna wonder how you could afford this car?
- I'll tell him the truth.
- What?
!
I mean, I'll say it was a gift from my mother-in-law and I had to accept it to keep peace in the family.
Now, here's why I think you guys haven't been on the ball.
- The first thing you gotta - Excuse me, Mr. Sheldrake.
- You play golf, don't you?
- Yes.
It's a beautiful day.
We can get in nine holes and talk at the same time.
Only if we play the same ball.
Now, here's what I think your basic mistake has been.
You just don't understand the meatpacking business.
Yes?
Put him on.
I'll just be a moment.
Well, Darrin boy, how are you enjoying the day off?
Good.
But don't make any plans for the weekend.
I think we may have an emergency coming up.
No kidding, a new car?
Is that right?
Sounds wild.
Just a minute.
It's Darrin Stephens.
He wants us to come see his new car.
Sounds like something really special.
Tate, I didn't fly in all the way from Cincinnati to see a new car.
Darrin, maybe I'll stop in on my way home.
Right.
Bye.
Sounds expensive.
I wonder where he got that kind of money.
Can I get back to why I think you fellas are off the track with my product, huh?
Oh, sure, sure.
It's one of those new experimental jobs.
- What is?
- Stephens' car.
Has a flip-top roof, hydraulic suspension and a 425-horsepower engine.
How'd you like to drive that home?
All I wanna drive home is my point.
Namely, that your ideas for my product have been too routine.
No dash or imagination.
Tate, this is the space age, and Sheldrake wants to be a part of it.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes.
But how do we work sausages into the space age?
That's your job.
Well let me see now.
It's got hydraulic suspension, huh?
- What has?
- Stephens' car.
Tate, can't you keep your mind on one thing for more than a minute?
"Made in Detroit"?
Charlie, we gotta find some way to explain that car's disappearance.
You're right.
We gotta find some way.
- There's only one problem.
- What's that?
There is no way to explain it.
I mean, what do you say?
"Sorry, we lost it".
Reminds me of a guy I know who lost a house.
A house, no kidding?
How?
Back taxes.
Charlie, I wish I had your sense of humour.
- I'd cut my throat.
- Now, there's an idea.
- Hi.
- Car all tucked in?
- I was looking at the engine - Would you like some tea?
Oh, no, thank you.
I was just looking at the engine.
It was cute the way you put " Made in Detroit" on it.
And a serial number.
- Makes it look real legitimate.
- What do you mean?
The car is legitimate.
Of course, you mean a legitimate copy, don't you?
Where did that car come from?
- Darrin.
- How should I know?
Look in that magazine.
That's where it was when I cast the spell.
You mean it came from Detroit?
!
What do you think, the stork brought it?
Now, listen, you two.
I don't understand.
I do.
Your mother gave me a hot car for a present.
- Mother!
- Don't you look at me like that.
I was just trying to do what's-his-name a favour.
- But to steal a car?
- Well, where was I going to get it?
I'm a witch, not a car manufacturer.
- Will you do me a favour?
- What?
The next time you decide to do me a favour, don't do me any favours.
Stop it.
Darrin, dear, there's no reason to be in a snit.
Mother just didn't understand what she was doing.
Well, I mean, the worst you can say is that she was a trifle overeager.
- Swell.
That car is worth a fortune.
There's probably an alarm out all over the country.
What do we tell the police when they catch up with it?
Your mother is an overeager witch?
Well, I'm not gonna stay here and listen to this ingrate.
Goodbye, Samantha.
I'm off to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras.
Oh, Mother, wait a minute.
Oh, please, Mother.
Please come back.
Sam, let her go.
She's caused enough trouble.
Mother.
Mother, are you listening to me?
- You come back here right this second.
- Sam, I said forget it.
Who needs her?
We've got trouble enough.
The first thing is to go to the garage and put that car back where it belongs.
Don't you understand?
I can't.
Mother's the only one that can bring it back.
Mother.
Mother, dear.
You're a dear, sweet, wonderful woman.
We need you.
- Mother?
Mother, dear?
- It's no use.
- You insulted her.
- I insulted her?
- Oh, no.
I insulted her.
- Well, let's not stand here quibbling.
The first thing to do is to go out and lock that garage door before It's too late.
The police.
Darrin, pull yourself together.
Open the door.
Hello, Darrin.
You know Mr. Sheldrake.
- Why, sure.
- Nice to see you again, Stephens.
Nice to see you again, sir.
Please come in.
- Thank you.
Thank you very much.
- Oh, hi, Sam.
Mr. Sheldrake, I'd like you to meet my wife.
- This is Samantha.
- How do you do, Mr. Sheldrake?
- Pleased to meet you, Mrs. Stephens.
- Can I get you some coffee?
- No, thanks.
- No, no.
Don't bother, Sam.
- Sit.
Make yourselves comfortable.
- Thank you, thank you.
We've been brainstorming new ideas for Sheldrake Sausages and we thought we'd bounce them off you.
And we're both anxious to see that car too.
- Car?
- Car?
Your new car.
- New car?
- New car?
Yeah.
I'm dying to see that hydraulic suspension system.
Where is it?
Where?
Well, the thing is l've just put it to bed.
- At noon?
Oh, yes.
It's all tucked in for its nap.
We promise not to wake it up.
Well, the thing is, it's Are you trying to say "business before pleasure"?
Yes, that's it.
First, let me hear those ideas you wanna bounce off me.
But watch out for the rebound.
Remember, I've had a half a day off.
Stephens, let's look at the car and talk about it at the same time.
- Well, you see - Darling, you go ahead.
I'll see if I can contact that party.
Oh, okay.
It's in the garage.
Mother, now I want you to listen to me carefully, wherever you are.
Now, I've never asked you for anything important.
Well, at least not recently, not since I asked you to be nice to Darrin.
But now we're in a terrible spot.
So would you come back and help us out, please?
Mother?
Mother, can you hear me?
Oh, boy, are you a stubborn witch.
- What did you say?
- Well, don't you get it, Darrin?
"Face the space age with Sheldrake Sausages".
Yeah, and what better symbol can we use than this car?
The car of the future.
Why, it's perfect.
But What What I'm saying is What are you trying to say?
Well, since you asked, I'm not sure that the car is the right symbol.
Stephens, believe me l'll make this the most photographed car in the country.
I'll go further.
I'm positive it's the wrong symbol.
You see, Mr. Sheldrake?
When you deal with McMann & Tate you're not buying yourself a lot of yes men.
This boy's got real integrity.
What are you trying to do, sabotage the account?
Well, now that you've had a chance to think it over, tell the truth.
Sheldrake's idea has real magic in it.
- Right, Darrin?
- Right.
- That's why I'm against it.
- What?
- Darrin?
- Excuse me.
- Any luck?
- No, I'm afraid not.
Why is she being so stubborn?
Doesn't she realize the terrible spot I'm in?
You see that, I answered my own question.
Darrin, that's not quite fair.
Mother just didn't think of the consequences.
Sam, one of the consequences is breathing down my neck right now.
The client wants to use the car as part of his advertising campaign.
Oh, my stars.
Well, just refuse.
It's your car.
- What?
- Well, it's in your custody.
Sam, I'm going to be in custody if you don't contact your mother.
If she won't come back, there's only one thing to do.
- I'll have to go find her.
- To New Orleans?
- I'll only be gone a few minutes.
- I don't know.
- Here they come.
- Have a nice trip.
Look, Darrin, I think I know what's bothering you.
You just got the car.
It's brand-new.
Naturally, you're concerned about our using it.
- Yes, it's perfectly understandable.
- As a matter of fact Let's drop the matter for now, huh?
And maybe later on, we'll see, huh?
Thanks, Larry.
Mr. Sheldrake has just one little request.
Yes.
Could I drive it around the block?
No!
No.
Charlie, whatever we decide to tell J.J., we have to be in complete agreement.
- Right.
- It's important to stick together.
Right, right.
United we fall and divided No, united Forget it, and let's try to find something we can agree on.
Okay, if that's the way you feel, it's your car and if you don't want Sheldrake to drive it, that's your business.
Thank you, Larry, for being so understanding.
But it's my business to keep our clients happy.
Any employee that doesn't cooperate isn't going to stay in my business.
- Is that a threat?
- Call it a promise.
Mr. Sheldrake, you wanna drive my car?
- Here are the keys.
- Thanks.
Drive slowly.
Watch out for the light.
Be very kind to those brakes.
They're very tender.
My boy, I was driving before you were born.
Just once around the block?
I can't bear to watch this.
I'm going in to have a double.
Darrin, we're back.
- Sam, you found her.
- Yes.
- You don't look too well.
- And I have you to thank for it.
If that's the way you're going to act, I'm going Mother, please, wait.
Mother came all the way from the Mardi Gras in New Orleans to help you.
- Don't ask me why.
- All right, I'm sorry.
Just put that car back where it belongs, please.
Oh, she will, she will.
Just don't bug her.
- What are you doing?
- She has to concentrate.
Wait a minute.
Not now!
What did you do that for?
- Isn't that what you wanted?
- No.
He's too much.
Samantha, don't you re?
Isn't Sheldrake back yet?
Larry, I'm afraid he went a little further than we expected.
Oh, my stars!
- We're in complete agreement, right?
- Right.
You're gonna go to Peru, I'm taking off for Brazil.
And if anybody asks, we never even heard of the car.
- We never even heard of each other.
- Right.
Hi there.
Sheldrake's the name, sausage is my game.
Charlie.
Here's something we can agree on.
I won't say anything about this if you don't.
Right.
Right.
Has the pounding gone away?
Oh, yeah.
And it's changed to a low thump.
I feel terrible about this.
I don't understand.
A responsible man, head of a big company.
And he just drives off with your car.
Oh, well, Larry, you know these rich men.
- They're so eccentric.
- But I know how much that car is worth.
Well, Darrin isn't worried, why should you be?
- He's not worried?
- No, I'm sick.
Darrin.
Excuse me.
Hello?
No, this is Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, Mr. Sheldrake.
Where are you?
At the airport?
What's he doing there?
And what?
What about the car?
Mr. Sheldrake there's something I'd like to try and explain to you but I'm not absolutely sure how to What's that?
You have?
You were?
You are?
Oh, why, Mr. Sheldrake, that sounds wonderful.
Yes.
All right.
Goodbye.
What is it?
What happened to him?
What about the car?
He took a slight detour.
Just going around the block?
He said that someday, when he figured it out for himself he'd tell you all about it.
- What?
He also said to go ahead and use the car in the advertising campaign.
- He has the rights to it.
- But how did he get them?
Well, it seems he ran into the two men who designed it.
I don't understand anything about this, but it's okay with me.
He sure flipped over that car, didn't he?
- Yeah, he flipped, all right.
- Oh, he certainly did.
Yeah, he said it's a great experimental car and they'll have no trouble getting it off the ground.
Well, that's what he said.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Well, all done.
Now to put everything back.
Oh, our new lamp.
No.
No witchcraft.
But our new lamp.
Well if I'm gonna go, I might as well go for broke.
But from now on, no more witchcraft.
Who says?
There I go.
Missed the mark again.
One mistake after another.
Oh, dear, Aunt Clara.
Well, we all make mistakes.
My mistakes?
Oh, no, dear.
No, no.
No, I'm finished.
I'm going to give it up and change myself into something Oh, something useful, like a footstool or Now, you listen to me.
Aunt Clara, you get that thought right out of your head.
I've just come from a meeting with Endora, Hagatha and Enchantra.
And they've been a whole hour trying to put it into my head.
- Oh, no.
- Yes.
And your And your mother Yeah, well She said I'm an old cow and I should be put out to pasture.
Well!
Oh, well.
Well, they were right.
Hagatha said it's time I hung up the gloves.
Or did she say broom?
Okay, you can forget about that prospectus for the Morton Milk account.
You wanna know why?
Because while you've been slowpoking along showing Morton what we can do on paper the Whittle Agency's been doing something creative.
That's why.
Creative like what?
They're going to put Ginger, Morton's world-famous Guernsey cow on display in the lobby of this building next week, all week which happens to be National Milk Week.
People will gape through the window and then run, not walk, to the neighbourhood market and buy a quart of Morton's Milk.
- How about that?
- Well, that's pretty creative.
- It was creative enough for C.L. Morton.
- I thought it was agreed.
- Ideas were to - You'd better get with it.
If you think you can get ahead riding on nothing but hard work and talent, you're crazy.
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetheart.
Guess what?
Aunt Clara just stopped by for a visit.
That kind of news I don't need.
Darrin, I'm worried about her.
She's terribly depressed.
She's talking about giving up, retirement.
Well, that kind of news I do need.
Darrin, this is serious.
She's been talking about changing herself into something.
Permanently.
Something useful.
Sam.
I thought if I brought her into town and we took her someplace for lunch it might lift her spirits, if you'll excuse the expression.
Oh, it would mean so much to her, you taking us both to lunch.
Well, okay, honey.
While you're at it, would you stop at the jeweller's and pick up my watch?
I meant to this morning, but I forgot.
Oh, sure.
Oh, and Louise is gonna babysit.
What if Tabatha suddenly decides to?
You know.
No, no, don't worry.
No, I'll put Tabatha down for a nap before I leave.
- Okay, sweetheart.
Bye-bye.
- Bye, sweetheart.
Aunt Clara, guess what.
You and l Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara, is that you?
I can't even make it as a potted plant.
Oh, why not?
Can't you see I'm wilting?
There must be something I could change myself into where I wouldn't make mistakes.
Aunt Clara, the only thing I want you to change is your hat.
And we're gonna do that by buying you the prettiest one we can find.
Oh, I must say, Aunt Clara you do look lovelier in daisies than you did in philodendron leaves.
And you're much better company here than you would have been if you'd gone out to pasture.
Well, thank you, dear.
And thank you so much for the hat.
- It was time that I got a new one.
- Time!
Oh, I forgot.
I forgot Darrin's watch.
Oh, dear.
Oh, it'll take me at least 15 minutes to walk to the jeweller's and back.
But it would only take me a second to pop over and back.
- Promise you won't tell.
- Me, tell?
Oh, certainly not.
Tell what?
Aunt Clara, you wait right here.
I'll be I'll be back in a flash.
In a flash.
Probably easier to get than a taxi.
Hi there, beautiful.
Well, you seem to be doing pretty well.
Not wilting.
Now, you know, when I was a plant, the trouble Do you mind?
This is private.
I Look, I got explicit instructions to bring her in here.
I'm giving you new explicit instructions.
- Get that cow out of here.
- Will you listen already?
This is Ginger.
I don't care if it's Tallulah.
Look, I didn't hear nothing about allowing any cow to loiter in any building on my beat.
Listen.
Why don't we nicely call up Mr. Whittle?
He's the advertising man.
He's right in the building here.
He'll come down, and he'll explain that he's the one that got me the clearance to bring Ginger in here.
I tell you what, I'll even use my own dime.
Come on.
Hey, lady?
If you get tired of yakking to the plant there's a cow with nobody to talk to.
Oh, isn't this all cute?
Well, of all things Well, hello there.
Going up?
Going up with you would be like going to heaven.
You're what I call a class A, number-one, all-time gorgeous Please, would you mind going up to heaven without me?
I'm very busy looking for someone.
Take your pick.
There's some beauts today.
- Talk about fruitcakes.
- Fruitcakes?
I don't care how long I live, I ain't never gonna get so sophisticated that an old dame talking to a plant one minute and a cow walking around the lobby the next ain't a novelty.
- A cow?
- A cow.
A co Where?
Where?
Around the corner.
How about it?
Wanna take a ride with me?
Fly to heaven?
Next trip.
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara?
Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara.
A cow, of all things.
And in Darrin's building.
Well, this is hardly out to pasture.
You Yes.
Yes, sir.
A policeman.
That's all we need.
No, no, don't try to talk.
I better get you home.
Oh, Louise must be upstairs with Tabatha.
What happened to my Ginger?
You made me lose my cow.
Aunt Clara, just because I told you not to talk before doesn't mean that Samantha, is that you?
Oh, hi.
Hi, Louise.
- I'll be right up.
- Oh, no, no, no.
I'll be right down.
Tabatha's asleep.
Aunt Clara, dear, you go into the kitchen.
I'll try and get rid of her.
Aunt Clara, I said, in the kitchen.
Just because you chose to be a cow doesn't mean you have to be a stupid one.
And stubborn.
- How come you're back so early?
- Oh, hi, Louise.
I can't thank you enough for staying with Tabatha.
And if I can ever return the favour, don't hesitate to call me.
- I'm sorry you have to rush off.
- But I don't.
Oh, that's right, you don't.
- Well, then why am I leaving?
- Because I'm in such a hurry.
Oh, sure.
Thanks a lot, Louise.
- Oh, boy.
- You can say that again.
Oh, dear.
Aunt Clara being a cow is no solution to anything.
Now, please.
Come on, change yourself back.
Don't tell me you've forgotten how.
- Hello?
- Samantha?
You were coming for lunch.
What happened?
I've been worried.
Well, hi, sweetheart.
I was going to call you, but something came up.
Well, that is, something happened.
Aunt Clara's sort of indisposed.
Sort of indisposed?
What does that mean?
Oh, nothing serious.
She'll be all right.
You better be.
I'll see you at dinner, okay?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sure.
Okay.
Goodbye.
Sort of indisposed?
Now, Aunt Clara, you know I can't change you back.
You just have to do that yourself.
Why not try to relax a little, rest a little first?
How about a nice glass of warm milk?
Warm milk.
What am I saying?
Yes, Samantha, what are you saying?
Oh, Louise.
- Didn't you leave?
- You gave me the wrong jacket.
Oh, well, I'm sorry, Louise.
I must've been thinking about the cow.
I'm not quite used to it yet.
Having one, I mean.
Oh, but as soon as I am, I'll call you.
All right?
All right.
Oh, Aunt Clara.
A cow?
I'm going to call Larry.
Aunt Clara, why couldn't you have been a Chihuahua?
Oh, nice.
Okay, you wanna know why the Whittle Agency may lose the Morton Milk account and we may get another whack at it?
Well, I suppose Because Whittle has gone and lost C.L. Morton's cow.
- That's why.
- Lost a?
- How could anyone lose a cow?
- I don't know.
But losing Ginger Morton's world-famous, prize-winning Guernsey cow worth at least $12,000 you gotta admit, that's pretty creative.
Larry, I would like to shake hands with a man who really knows how to gloat.
World's champ.
They're down in the lobby.
Whittle's about to have a nervous breakdown and C.L. Morton wants to put the city under arrest for cow-napping.
Let's go.
Come on.
You're through delivering cows, mister, I hope you know that.
On account of you and your authority, I got a missing cow on my hands.
If she were on your hands, she wouldn't be missing.
You're gonna give me logic, right?
Policeman's logic?
- You got something against policemen?
- Yeah.
A missing cow on my hands.
That's what I got against policemen.
Don't worry, Mr. Morton.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara.
Oh, Darrin.
Darrin, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
You're supposed to be at home.
I am?
Oh, my goodness, I've goofed again.
No, stay right here.
I'm gonna call home and check this out with Sam.
Stay right here.
Every endeavour is being made to find your cow, Ginger.
And I give you my word that What are you doing here, Tate?
Well, I thought I might be of some assistance.
- Is something wrong?
- Something wrong?
Why, this numskull Whittle Mr. Tate, your secretary says to get on the horn to your wife.
- Very important.
- Later.
I think I'd better have a visit with Mr. Tate here.
Mr. Morton, if you'd only have a little patience.
Your secretary said your wife said to call her now, not later.
- Lf I was you, pal - Look here, young man.
Okay, okay.
I wouldn't take on both of them, a wife and a secretary.
All right, all right.
I get the message.
Excuse me for a minute, Mr. Morton.
Now, there goes a good man.
Sam, what I'm trying to say is I think you misplaced Aunt Clara.
She's here in the lobby of the building.
Oh, Darrin, don't be ridiculous.
She's standing right next to me eating her oats.
Sam?
Amazing how they pick their times.
- Her what?
- Her oa Oh, well, it's really oatmeal.
But I didn't know what else to give her.
She missed having her lunch.
Sam Darrin, I told you Aunt Clara was upset.
She turned herself into a cow.
- She turned herself into a what?
- A cow.
I think you made a little mistake.
- A mistake?
- Sam's got a what in their where?
A cow?
What kind of a cow?
Sam, honey.
Aunt Clara's here in the lobby.
Aunt Clara's there?
Are you sure?
Is she all right?
- She's fine.
- Bye, Louise.
Well, if she's there, then who have I got here?
And what was she doing in your lobby?
What difference does it make?
I mean, who cares, really?
The point is, since you're practically next door why don't you just pop over and fix things, if you know what I mean.
In a minute, Lar.
- I'll have to get Mother to babysit.
- Terrific.
You even agree to that?
Must be worse than I thought.
That's right.
I'll be waiting for you in the lobby, honey.
Things are sort of crowded in spots, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, all right.
Bye.
- Something on your mind, Lar?
- Yeah.
Are you out of yours?
I said get the account, not steal the cow.
- Steal what cow?
- Ginger.
Ginger?
Do you or do you not have a cow in your living room?
- No, I don't know - I was just talking to Louise and she said she saw a cow standing in your Larry, you don't think?
You don't think that our cow is the Morton cow?
Your cow?
Oh, Darrin, don't be ridiculous.
How could you possibly think it was the same cow?
Well, after all, I mean In the first place, our cow's name is Trixie.
- Trixie?
- Yeah.
Hadn't we better get over there, see what's going on?
What do you want with a cow?
Actually, I don't want one at all.
It's all Sam's idea.
She's on a big economy kick like a lot of the housewives are.
Baking her own bread and growing their own vegetables.
Well, Sam wants to grow our own milk and butter and cheese, cream, the whole bit.
Well, why didn't she tell Louise?
- Probably afraid she'd steal the idea.
- Steal the idea?
- Hadn't we better get over there?
- Yeah.
Sure, sure.
Let's get over there.
Now, you've had enough, whoever you are.
You're gonna have to go back a different way if that lobby's as crowded as Darrin says.
Oh, what would be the best way?
Why didn't I think of that before?
Well, aren't you cute.
Okay, you'll be back to normal in a minute.
If you wanna blame anybody, blame the fuzz.
- Lf he don't bug me, I don't lose her.
- Look.
Nobody's got any right dumping a cow on my beat anyhow.
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder and, boy, is it ever in the eyes of this beholder.
- Your chariot awaits.
- How nice.
Five, please.
Honey, going up with you is like going to heaven.
I bet you say that to all your female passengers all the time.
Only the class A, number-one lookers like you.
All day long, fat dames, skinny dames tall dames, short dames, old dames.
Only one in a hundred is a doll like you.
I don't give the eye to every one of that hundred either.
Only maybe 15 percent.
I guess I'm giving the eye to the right percentage, though, huh?
- You're gonna get a fat lip.
- Yeah?
You know how many years you can get for hitting a civilian?
Mr. Morton, I am convinced that there is dirty work afoot.
There has to be, with that man hanging around here like a vulture.
Are you pointing your stubby little finger at me, Whittle?
Larry, take it easy.
- Sam.
- All this fuss about a cow?
- Well, where is it?
- Coming down.
Coming down?
I think someone should know it's a very stupid cow.
There she is.
There's my Ginger.
Oh, there's my baby.
Papa's little girl.
Yes, sir.
That's my little girl.
Isn't that sweet?
You see, everything turns out for the best.
Yeah, when you're around to give everything a big assist, it does.
You know your papa, don't you?
Yes, you do.
Well Well, as I said, I goof, goof, goof, goof and spoil everything for everybody.
Oh, I wish I were a doorknob.
Now, Aunt Clara, you've got to stop blaming yourself.
Yeah, let Samantha take a couple of bows.
I'll get it.
I'll get the door.
- Hello?
- Yes?
Oh, Larry.
What?
We got the Morton account?
- That's great.
What cinched the deal?
- Oh, really?
When you told Mr. Morton that Sam and I were such cow fanciers?
What'd you tell him a thing like that for?
What difference does it make as long as it cinched the deal?
Well, thank you very much.
Mr. Morton is sending us a little something?
Well, that's very nice.
Yeah, okay, Larry.
Yeah.
Goodbye.
We got the Morton account.
On account of we're such cow fanciers.
And Mr. Morton is sending us a little something.
Is that good?
Well, when is he sending it?
He already has.
That was the delivery man.
He's bringing Mr. Morton's little something around back.
You see, Aunt Clara?
All of your mistakes turned out to be wonderful mistakes.
- Oh, really, Samantha.
- Including the cows.
What cows?
The ones from Mr. Morton.
- Thanks a lot, Aunt Clara.
- Yes.
Thank you, Aunt Clara.
Well, you're very welcome.
- How?
- Aunt Clara, we love cows.
- Don't we?
- Oh, yes, yes.
Yes.
You love Well, it takes all kinds, you know.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Follow me.
Follow me.
Follow me.
Mother, would you please stop bouncing around like Tinker Bell and tell me what all this is about?
Samantha, come here and sit down.
Samantha, your Aunt Clara is in trouble.
- Well, what's unusual about that?
- My dear, I am serious.
We all spent the weekend at Lady Montague's castle in Scotland and, my dear, it was positively embarrassing.
Your Aunt Clara made one devastating move after another.
So Hagatha and Enchantra and I decided that she'd reached the point where she should be earthbound.
- So we're going to put her on trial.
- No!
Or she may have the witch's alternative of turning herself into an inanimate object like a salad bowl or a lamp or a teakettle or a whatever Something that's useful.
Well, I think this whole thing is unfair, unreasonable and inhuman.
I mean, unwitchly.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way.
It'll make your job a lot easier.
- Job?
- Your Aunt Clara has chosen you to be her defence attorney.
What?
The court will convene here at 10:00 tomorrow morning.
- Here?
- Judge Bean will preside.
- Judge Bean?
- See you then, darling.
Oh, Mother, please wait a minute.
Who decided that?
Come on.
Why here?
Why here of all places?
Just tell me that.
- This is most unreasonable.
- Samantha, what's going on?
- Honey, is breakfast ready?
- You only have time for a sip of coffee.
What are you talking about?
It's only 8:30.
It's later than you think.
Look.
- Holy cow!
- Oh, me too.
I've got a lot of work to do.
- What was that?
- What was what?
It sounded like someone at the back door.
Oh, you must be hearing things.
You're not going to tell me you didn't hear that.
I'm not?
I mean, I guess I'm not.
- It must be the diaper service.
- I better dash.
- You don't wanna be late.
- See you tonight.
Drive carefully.
Now, who could be knocking at the cellar door?
As if I didn't know.
Hi there, Aunt Clara.
Come on.
Do you know that one of your chimneys leads to the furnace?
Oh, dear!
- Here.
Give me this.
Give me the brolly.
- Oh, yes.
- I'll clean you up.
You'll feel better.
- Oh, good.
There!
- Oh, how nice!
- You like it?
- Oh, thank you, dear.
Thank you.
- Yes, you look lovely.
Now come on, come on.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.
Want coffee?
- No, thanks.
- All right.
Well, what's new?
Nothing.
Oh, nothing.
Oh, didn't you spend the weekend at Lady Montague's castle?
Oh, yes, yes.
I had a lovely time.
Lovely.
- Except for one little incident.
- What was that?
Well, I didn't think it was so awful but the way everyone was carrying on you'd think it was a disaster.
- What happened?
- Well, we went hunting and I shot one of Lady Montague's dogs.
- How awful!
- Yeah, it was a disaster.
Lady Montague must have been terribly angry.
No, no.
She was furious.
And she said she couldn't believe that anyone's aim could be as poor as that.
- Did you apologize?
- Oh, certainly not.
I told her my aim was perfect and she should have told me we were hunting for birds.
Poor Aunt Clara.
Well, maybe I should be earthbound.
Well, who said anything about that?
Well, what I want to say is that l - Clara, Samantha knows about the trial.
- Oh, she does, does she?
Oh.
Well, then I won't have to worry about how to bring up the subject.
Don't you worry, Aunt Clara.
I'll clear you of the charges.
Thank you.
Well, now I think I'll go to the den and rest until the trial.
Clara why don't you pop into the den, like a witch?
All right.
I will.
Well, there wasn't anything wrong with the way she did that, was there?
Wasn't there?
I certainly have my work cut out for me, don't I?
Hello, Larry?
I'm here at the office, and l Well, I just happened to get here a little early that's all.
Remember that the next time I ask for a raise.
Anyway, I rushed out of the house so fast I forgot to take along the Ganzer Garage Door file.
Would you mind stopping at my house and picking it up?
It's in the bottom right-hand drawer of my desk.
Thanks a lot, Larry.
Now, Aunt Clara, we have to get to work on your defence.
What you need is a basic refresher course.
Stand up.
Come on.
First, the basic ABC's.
Digital control.
See this pencil?
- Yeah.
- Yeah, good.
Now I want you to levitate it and put it in that drawer.
Go ahead.
Now, remember, concentrate.
Take good aim.
Go on.
Aim.
Keep working, Aunt Clara.
I'll be right back.
Move!
Good morning, Sam.
Sorry to barge in like this but Darrin asked me to get some papers from his desk.
Oh, Larry, it's always a pleasure to have you barge in.
- It's right in the den.
- Samantha.
Samantha.
You know my aunt.
Larry Tate, Aunt Clara.
- Aunt Clara - Yeah.
Yes, yes, I do.
- What are you looking for?
- The desk!
- A desk?
- Yes.
Aunt Clara, get rid of it.
Larry, I can't tell you how happy I am you came by.
There's something very important I've been meaning to ask you.
- Sure.
What is it?
- Well, it's about Tabatha.
What college do you feel would be right for her?
She's only a year and a half old.
Now, you papers and drawers, you get back in there.
And now, you desk, no nonsense.
You go back in the den where you belong.
Sam, I really should get the Ganzer papers and go.
But, Larry, we haven't even discussed the Eastern college versus the Western college.
Well, I think it's really a matter of individual Aunt Clara dear Mr. Tate hasn't got time to listen to your little song.
He's very busy, and he needs those papers that are in Darrin's desk.
You mean the one that's back in the den?
That's it.
Yes.
In the den, Larry.
Help yourself.
Samantha, if you want to resign as my defence counsel I understand.
If I were you - You scared the life out of me.
l'd take her up on that.
No, Mother.
I said I'd defend her, and I meant it.
Well, it's about time.
- Ladies.
- Judge.
Thank you, judge, so much.
Oh, Endora, dear.
Enchantra!
You poor dear, Clara.
Sorry to be late.
We were caught in the eye of a hurricane.
Of course, Hagatha.
- Oh, you found it.
- Yes.
You ought to talk to Darrin about straightening out that desk of his.
- I will, I will.
- Oh, I had I had one suggestion about a college for Tabatha.
Oh, really?
Well, I'm just dying to hear it, Larry, some other time.
That will be all, Macbeth.
Did Did I hear a car in there?
A car?
In the living room?
Sorry.
Battle fatigue, I guess.
- Yes.
- So long, Sam.
Bye.
I don't believe you know my niece.
Samantha, this is His Honour, Judge Bean.
- How do you do?
- My honour, ma'am.
- You're looking lovely, Samantha.
- Thank you, Mother.
Let's get this show on the road.
- I've a pressing engagement.
- Mother!
Oh, are we going to start before we have tea?
Be quiet.
Clara, are you ready?
Now, now, just a minute.
I object.
You can't.
The trial hasn't started yet.
But you've made up your minds already.
This isn't a trial.
It's a A witch hunt.
That's very good, my dear.
- She's very witty, isn't she?
- Very.
You don't understand.
If we're going to have a trial, let's have a fair one.
Shall we begin, Your Honour?
Very well.
Ladies, if you would stand.
Clara, if you please.
Well, don't dawdle!
Oh, never mind!
Hear ye, hear ye!
Witches' coven, part one, is about to convene!
All those having business before this court, draw near and ye shall be heard.
- Proceed!
- The Witches' Coven v. Aunt Clara.
Well, read the charges!
"The coven charges that the defendant has repeatedly failed in the practice of witchcraft and that, as a result, she must be deprived of all rights privileges and benefits deriving from membership in the witches' community".
Betty, I asked you to make a copy of all the material in the folder that Mr. Tate picked up at my house.
You did?
These are my income tax reports.
That's what was in the folder?
Marvellous.
I'll just have to go home and rummage through my desk.
This concludes the case for the prosecution.
- And a very good case too.
- Aunt Clara.
Well, the defence may proceed.
And please move it along, dear.
You know I'm late.
As far as I'm concerned, I could hand down a decision right now.
Now, just a minute!
Well, the case for the prosecution is pretty conclusive.
Well, just what have they proven?
That Aunt Clara's made a few mistakes?
Well, so what?
Nobody's perfect.
And I do not agree that just because someone is getting on in years that they have outlived their usefulness.
No.
Now if you ban her from our society which is what you're trying to do, it'll be our loss because her kind of warmth and compassion is very hard to find.
So, I move for a dismissal on the grounds of love.
Motion denied.
Well.
Very well.
I guess I'll just have to prove that Aunt Clara does have all of her powers.
Excuse me, Your Honour.
Now first, ordinary manipulation.
Aunt Clara, make it come to you.
Now, perhaps we should have Aunt Clara conjure up something.
Let's see.
I wo Excuse me.
Let's see how well you do with Samantha gone.
What shall we have her conjure up?
How about something nice and cold?
I'm dying of thirst.
All right.
That sounds easy enough.
Easy for you.
Yes?
Oh, Darrin!
My key wouldn't open the door.
That's because I double-locked it.
But it opens the door even when it's double-locked.
Oh, then I must have triple-locked it.
Well, do you mind if I come in?
Yes.
I mean, I just decided to wax the front hall.
You mean you want me to come in the back door.
No, no.
No, the kitchen floor has just been waxed too.
Honey, Larry picked up the wrong papers.
I need the Ganzer Garage Door account.
Oh, well, you go around to the den window.
I'll get them for you.
It's in the bottom right-hand drawer of my desk.
Okay.
What's that?
Something nice and cold.
Oh, Aunt Clara, please, wait until I get back.
Would you like to try for two out of three?
Thank you.
Any special kind of drink?
Something tropical would be nice.
Something tropical coming up.
- Here you are, sweetheart.
- Thank you.
What was she trying for?
Something tropical, in the way of a drink.
Well, it's closer.
Sam.
Sam!
- These are the wrong papers!
- I'll be right back.
Darrin, what are you doing?
Sam, these are the bills from Glazer's Garage.
- Oh, I'll get you the right ones.
- Never mind.
I'll get them myself.
Or has the carpet just been waxed?
- I know why you don't want me in there.
- You do?
Finally figured it out.
Ladies' club, right?
- Sort of.
- Is it the committee for the bazaar?
Oh, I'd certainly call them a bizarre committee.
Baked Alaska?
Well, now that I'm back shall we try one more thing?
You're wasting your time.
The overwhelming weight of the evidence is clear.
- Yes, but - Silence!
The accused will please rise and face the court.
The court has reached a verdict.
- Poor dear Clara!
- Clara, darling!
They usually cry after the bazaar when they see how much they've lost.
Oh, wouldn't this make you sick?
Let's have the decision!
Beginning tomorrow morning at daybreak you shall be earthbound!
Well, I'll have a lot of company, won't I?
Well, I must be going now.
L Oh, no.
Not yet, Aunt Clara.
Stay a while.
- I'll never get out of here.
- Well!
No.
No.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, my dears.
Sam, what happened to my desk?
It's a mess!
Oh, goodbye, everybody!
Yes, Darrin?
I'd better be going.
Wait.
Where are you going?
Samantha, there comes a time in a person's life when his health takes precedence over everything.
I'm gonna lie down.
- Aunt Clara, you saved my life.
- Well, it was very good, wasn't it?
Thank you.
Well, I just waved my arms and everybody disappeared.
Yes!
So you see, Darrin, there wasn't anything else I could do.
Well, I had to help Aunt Clara.
But, as it turned out, she helped herself.
She didn't do me any good.
I've got a news flash for you.
People have been known to crack up under circumstances less weird than seeing polar bears, dog sleds and palm trees in their living room.
Probably because they're weird prone.
Fortunately, you're not.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Aunt Clara, why are you using the front door?
Well, I thought after last night I'd better not stretch my luck.
You don't have anything to worry about.
The judge reversed his decision, didn't he?
What choice did he have after that magnificent piece of witchcraft I came up with?
Aunt Clara Aunt Clara, just between you and me we both know it was just a mistake.
- Was it?
- Wasn't it?
Samantha, now if Darrin had been witnessing that scene it would've been very disastrous, wouldn't it?
Oh, yes.
Well, then, you wouldn't let anything happen like that to someone you love?
No.
So I waved.
You saw what happened.
Yes.
Yes, Aunt Clara, I certainly did.
And long may you wave.
Oh, sorry.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Good morning, Samantha.
I just popped in on my way to the Kasbah.
Ben Ahmed is giving the most marvellous cocktail party for the prime minister.
Well, that's lovely, Mother, but I can't talk right now.
I overslept, and Darrin's breakfast isn't ready.
Oh, very well.
I'll pitch in and help.
No, don't.
Hello?
No, ma'am.
This is the Stephens residence.
I'm afraid you have the wrong number.
It's quite all right.
Yeah.
Hello?
No, ma'am, I'm sorry.
You have the wrong number.
It's quite all right.
Digit dialling.
Hello?
No, ma'am, I am sorry, this is not the Sunnydale Rest Home.
No, I don't mean I'm sorry it's not.
It isn't.
Or is it?
Three wrong numbers in a row?
That was no lady.
That was my mother-in-law.
What are they up to?
Hello?
Listen, if you ring this phone one more time, I'm Oh, hello, Larry.
Sorry I shouted at you.
Thought you were my mother-in-law.
Mother-in-law?
You're not afraid to talk like that to your mother-in-law?
Darrin, if you were here, I'd get your autograph.
Instead, I got some news for you.
You're gonna take a little trip.
Where?
When?
Well, in that case, maybe Sam would Well, of course, if they aren't.
Yeah.
Oh, sure.
Bye, Lar.
Breakfast is ready.
- Bad news.
- I resent you addressing me like that.
I wasn't addressing you.
I just said "bad news".
- You were looking at me.
- Lf the shoe fits I'm warning you, shoes can kick.
- What do you mean, bad news?
- We're going to Honolulu.
- When?
- This afternoon.
- We are?
Honolulu?
- Sam.
- And you call that bad news?
- Sam.
Well, you certainly didn't give me much time to brush up on my hula.
- Honey, it's business.
- That's marvellous.
It's more fun on an expense account.
Sam, you're not going.
I can't take you.
You said "we".
"We" means the clients and myself.
They can't take their wives, so I can't very well take you.
It might get them in trouble with their own wives.
Well, it certainly was an exciting trip while it lasted.
I don't think I could get to Honolulu and back that fast flying solo.
I don't know what business it is of theirs whether I take my wife or not.
- Oh, Darrin, it doesn't matter.
- It's the principle of the thing.
Darrin, if you really wanted me to go I could turn myself into a necktie and sort of hang around.
No, that's out.
I'm not taking you along through witchcraft.
All right, that's settled.
Now, eat your breakfast.
I won't have time.
I have to meet the clients, come back and pack.
- But you have to eat something.
- Don't worry.
I'll call the coffee shop and have them send me some jelly doughnuts.
Oh, my.
He'll never win an Oscar for that performance.
What do you mean, performance?
I wouldn't trust a mortal out of my spell for two seconds.
He's up to something.
Oh, Mother.
You know, you're impossible.
I know Darrin.
He really wishes I could go.
Very well.
We'll see how good he is at wishing.
I've given him three wishes to prove it.
You what?
You can't.
I already have.
Mother, that's worse than reading somebody else's mail.
Worse?
It's almost as good as.
Now you'll know how three-faced mortals are.
Betty, make eight copies of this, will you, please?
Larry.
Well, you certainly got down to the office early this morning.
- Morning, Betty.
- Good morning.
I had to revise some estimates before the committee meeting.
I hate to do financial work at home.
Every time Louise sees a dollar sign, she shops.
Mr. Stephens, I have your ticket.
Don't give it to him.
Give it to me.
Change of plans.
The clients just called.
Seems they'd rather have the head of the company with them.
- And that's me.
- You're kidding.
I wish I were.
I had other plans.
Man, did I have other plans.
Well, I'd better call Sam.
She may have started packing already.
Well, I wonder what he'd like to take to Honolulu.
Toss a coin.
Blond or redhead.
Oh, very funny.
Hello?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
I just got your suitcase out of the closet.
Well, put it back in the closet.
I don't have to go.
- You don't?
- The clients want Larry to go instead.
They changed their minds just like that.
- Oh, wonderful.
- What is so funny?
He got his first wish.
He doesn't have to go to Honolulu.
The clients changed their minds just like that.
He's not going.
- Just like that, eh?
- Oh, Mother, you're such a sore loser.
Sweetheart, I have an idea.
The suitcase gave it to me.
This weekend, why don't we?
Hold it.
Don't get your hopes up.
With Larry gone, I'll have a lot of extra work.
Starting with Buffy Baker.
You have to escort her to the sales convention lunch and cocktails later.
Sam, I may be a little late for dinner tonight.
You have to take her where?
Her?
To a luncheon and cocktails?
Sure, sweetheart, that's fine.
Bye-bye.
Goodbye, sweetheart.
See you tonight.
- Has to take her where?
- Oh, Mother, it's purely routine.
I'll bet it's routine.
Darrin's company is handling the advertising for the Tropical Bathing Suit campaign.
A her in a bathing suit?
Now we're getting to the heart of the first wish.
Save your smirking, Mother.
It's purely normal and natural.
When Larry leaves, Darrin has to take over for him.
I'm curious.
I'm really curious to see what his second wish will be.
You are evil.
Excuse me.
She's here.
Buffy?
Ask her to come in.
Well, come in, come in, come in.
- Aren't I in?
- Isn't she cute?
I believe you know Mr. Stephens.
Oh, yes.
I never forget a face.
Easy, Buffy.
You all right?
Oh, there you are.
Sorry, Mr. Stephens, but the company asked me not to wear my glasses.
They said when I'm in a bathing suit, I'm not the one doing the looking.
Yes.
I mean, hello.
Hello.
- Won't you sit down?
- Oh, yes.
There you are.
I've been called out of town on business so Mr. Stephens will escort you to the luncheon and cocktail party.
Oh, how sweet of you.
He'll make a speech introducing you.
Oh, I'm just breathless to hear it.
And tomorrow the car will pick you up and take you to the airport.
Remember, you've got a banquet in Boston.
I know.
And then the day after tomorrow I have a luncheon in Chicago and then a banquet in Detroit then I'm off three days to reduce before St. Louis.
Mr. Stephens will take wonderful care of you.
My, how cosy that will be, won't it?
Darrin, before I go to Honolulu, I want you to know one thing.
- What?
- I hate you.
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
Larry get off all right?
- Right on the button.
What's for dinner?
- Creamed chicken.
- Thought you liked it.
- I had it for lunch.
I'm sorry.
I can fix you something else.
Oh, no.
I love yours.
It'll help me forget that stuff I had at the luncheon.
I saw Buffy's bathing suit ad in a magazine this afternoon.
Is she really as pretty in person as she is in pictures?
Prettier.
But up here, nothing.
Well, anyone who's as pretty as she is doesn't need anything up here.
Well, pretty or not, I'm stuck with her.
I'm going to have to fly to Boston to introduce her at a sales banquet.
Boston?
My lousy luck.
They liked my speech so much they insisted I repeat it tomorrow in Boston.
How long will you be gone?
Thanks to the jet age, I should be back in time for dinner.
- Lf you don't mind waiting till 9 or 10.
- Thought you said it was a banquet.
I've had my last forkful of creamed chicken.
I'm not going to eat I mean, banquet creamed chicken.
You don't have to explain.
I want to be back in time to have dinner with you.
I'd better call Buffy.
Larry told me to keep close tabs on her.
She can't remember what city she's in.
Wish number two, Buffy in Boston.
Hello, Mother.
I thought you were in the Kasbah.
I was, but I wouldn't miss this for the world.
You're wasting your time.
- Samantha.
- Yes, sweetheart?
Is my dinner jacket back from the cleaners?
I wanna wear it on the plane.
- Yes, it's in the closet.
- Dinner jacket.
How positively gala.
He's not eating there.
He's coming home to have dinner with me.
Maybe he will and maybe he won't.
I'd say it all depends on wish number three.
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Where are you?
Boston?
But, Darrin, you said that Well, why can't you get a plane?
Didn't you make a reservation?
Oh, but, sweetheart, that's absurd.
Why aren't the planes taking off?
Honey, Boston has been hit by a sudden snowstorm.
A snowstorm?
Why, it's so warm and balmy here we were gonna have dinner on the patio.
I don't care what it's like there.
I'm trying to tell you what it's like here.
Boston's been hit by a freak snowstorm.
A freak snowstorm?
When I give wishes, they're really spectacular.
And all the flights are cancelled.
Oh, no, honey.
I'm all right.
I have a room right here at the hotel.
Yes, the same one where they had the banquet.
It's pretty full because of the convention but I managed to get a room.
Now, don't worry.
I'm perfectly all right.
I'll see you as soon as I can get a plane out of here.
All right, sweetheart.
Bye-bye.
Well, you wanna stay for dinner?
What are we eating, crow?
- Hi.
- Hi.
Can I come in?
Yes, certainly.
Mainly, I wanted to get away from all those jokes in the lobby.
- Jokes?
- About my bathing suits and the snowstorm coming in to cool things off.
You were supposed to be flying to Chicago?
- The planes aren't taking off.
- I know.
The hotel's full, and I can't get a room.
Some of the gentlemen were kind enough to offer Never mind.
You can have this room.
I'll go to the airport and wait for a flight.
I wouldn't feel right putting you out of here.
Well, I wouldn't feel right staying.
Have a wonderful tour.
Bye-bye.
Wait.
I wanted to get another look at you before you go.
I like you.
Have a wonderful tour.
Bye.
Goodbye.
I didn't say anything.
I didn't say you said anything.
Well, I just said I didn't say anything.
Then may I say how happy I am that you are not saying anything.
That's Darrin.
He couldn't get back from Boston that fast.
He was fooling me.
Calling me from the airport.
I knew it all the time.
Hi.
Telegram for Mr. Stephens.
Thank you.
- What is it?
- A telegram for Darrin from Honolulu.
- Probably from Larry.
- You'd better call him in Boston.
- Now, I don't think that's necessary.
- How do you know?
It may be urgent.
I think you'd better call him.
No, I'm sure it can wait.
Well, he'll probably want you to open it up and read it to him.
That's what any thoughtful, considerate, mortal wife would do.
- Go ahead.
Go ahead, call him.
- No.
- Go on.
- All right.
Hello?
- Hello?
- I'm sorry, there must be some mistake.
- I wanted Mr. Stephens' room.
- This is Mr. Stephens' room.
May I speak to Mr. Stephens, please?
I'm sorry.
He isn't here.
Could you tell me where I could reach Mr. Stephens?
No, I'm sorry.
I don't know where he is now.
But if you'll only pardon me, I'm dead.
I didn't say one thing.
Mr. Ben Pepperdine, please come to gate 34.
Hi, honey.
Would you believe it?
It took until this afternoon to get a plane out.
If you wanna ruin your back, sleep on one of those airport benches.
They make them that way on purpose to discourage bums.
Hi, honey.
I don't blame you for not wanting to be kissed.
I haven't shaved.
Hey, I got good news for you.
My speech got more laughs in Boston than it did here.
All in all, I think the trip was worth it.
Watch it, honey.
I've only been to Boston three times.
I like it more each time I go.
You and I ought to go there sometime.
Sam, I may be mistaken but I think that maybe you're peeved about something.
Did anything happen while I was gone?
Well, I certainly couldn't have done anything.
Did I?
Did I?
Sam, I asked you a question.
Did I?
Sam, you're going to stay right here and talk to me.
Samantha.
Sam, where are you?
I can see you wherever you are.
- Now listen to me, Sam.
- Darrin, I'm leaving you.
- Sam.
- I'm going home to Mother.
What do you mean, going home to Mother?
Your mother's always here.
Sam.
Sam, where are you?
Now put that down.
Let Let go.
Well, you told me to let go.
Sam, what's the matter?
Did somebody tell you something or what?
What have I done?
Sam, now cut this out.
I wanna see you immediately.
Samantha, you're my wife, and I demand that you appear before me.
Listen to me, Sam.
Don't do anything that you may regret later on.
Where do you think you're going?
You're not leaving this house.
She couldn't.
Sam.
Sam, please wait.
Please wait.
All right, go ahead.
I can't stop you, and I know it.
Even if you were a mortal, I couldn't stop you.
But in all fairness, don't you think I'm entitled to know why?
The very least you could do is tell me why.
Very well.
- What are you wearing?
- My flying suit.
Mother warned me about you and that model, but I didn't believe her.
Buffy?
Me interested in Buffy?
Sam, don't make me laugh.
Don't you use that patronizing tone with me, or I won't say another word.
Me interested in Buffy?
I couldn't see her in a million years.
She can't see me without her glasses.
No?
Mother gave you three wishes to prove what was on your mind.
- Well, you proved it, all right.
- What did I prove?
Your first wish was that you didn't have to go to Honolulu so you could look after that model instead.
That wasn't a wish.
That was wished onto me by Larry.
Then you wished that you could go to Boston with her.
Then you wished up that freak snowstorm so that you'd have an excuse not to come home.
- That's what you think?
- That's what I know.
I called your hotel room last night.
Buffy answered the phone.
Of course.
She didn't have a place to stay, so I gave her my room and I slept at the airport.
Now you know why I'm leaving.
- Goodbye.
- Oh, wait.
I think we've covered the matter.
Your mother gave me three wishes, and I used them the way you said?
You did.
Watch this.
Three wishes, huh?
Stand back.
Wish number one.
I wish that your mother were standing right here.
Why, Darwin, I had no idea you were so fond of me.
You see?
I wouldn't have been able to do that if I'd used those three wishes on Buffy, would I?
You interrupted me at a party, you silly boy.
And I was getting along so famously with the prime minister.
- Darrin, l - Quiet, both of you.
I haven't finished.
You gave me those three wishes to make a fool out of me, didn't you?
I can make a fool out of myself without any help from you.
You are so right.
Mortals have a talent for it.
But as long as I've got them, I'm going to wish something that I've been wishing ever since I met you.
What is it?
Wish number two.
I wish that you would stay out of our lives fore Darrin, no.
For one week.
Wish number three.
About that flying suit.
I wish Darrin, never mind the third wish.
It's on the house.
Sweetheart?
Darrin?
Good night, sweetheart.
- Feeling better?
- Much.
After spending last night at an airport in a snowstorm that's just what I needed, a good hot shower.
I wish I could take another.
Darrin?
Oh, we forgot.
You had one more wish left.
Can I get you a towel?
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, honey.
Oh, is something the matter?
Yeah, Larry and I ran into an important client today and I couldn't remember the man's name.
And he knew it.
Oh, sweetheart, that happens to everyone once in a while.
It's natural.
Well, it's been happening too often, and it's not going to happen again.
I'm going to do something about it.
In fact, I already have.
I bought this.
I read two chapters on the train on the way home.
It's fascinating.
"Instant Memory Can Be Yours".
That's nice.
You start your homework, I'll start dinner.
Chapter three.
Testing your memory, dear?
Do you remember me?
I wouldn't mind forgetting you, Endora.
- A perfect memory, it's ridiculous.
- What's so ridiculous about it?
The ability to forget is very important to you mortals.
You do so many stupid things a perfect memory would be impossible to live with.
Is that so?
Total recall can only be handled by a strong, mature mind.
And where does that leave you, Dawson?
It leaves me wishing that you would mind your own business.
Excuse me if I ignore you.
So you want a perfect memory, huh?
- Cynthia.
- Who?
The wife of the man whose name I couldn't remember.
Cynthia Pennybaker.
- That's it.
Isn't that marvellous?
- Wonderful.
My memory's working.
I remember a lot of things about him.
He loves Beethoven, hates Wagner.
He raises parakeets.
He's got three children: Mark, age 14, Sylvia, age 11, and a little 3-year-old named Willie.
- Fascinating.
- Yes, isn't it?
And I only just began the third chapter.
- Good morning, sweetheart.
- Hi.
Hey, hotcakes and blueberries.
Thought I'd give you something different.
Oh, it's not different.
You fixed them once before.
No, I don't think so.
It was September 14, raining, Saturday.
You were wearing the yellow dress with the white polka dots.
That yellow dress.
I wonder what happened to it.
I'll have to look for it.
You gave it away to Mrs. Dumont for the rummage sale.
That's right, I did.
That was the same rummage sale that you whipped up that enormous chocolate cake for.
It was an emergency.
It was also a very good cause.
Five minutes after I'd told you no witchcraft and you had faithfully promised.
Darrin, while you're remembering do you also remember that every time you bring up that chocolate cake we get into an argument?
How about forgetting it?
I'll drop the subject.
But I'll never forget it.
- Yeah, Larry?
- Darrin, Mr. Pennybak er's here.
Mr. Pennybak er?
I wonder if you'd mind coming in.
My pleasure.
And every parakeet, or "budgie," as we call them that I've got, I've practically hand-raised from an egg.
How about that.
Your average bird isn't very intelligent, you know?
But those little budgies Oh, Ed, I don't know whether you remember Darrin Stephens or not.
Oh, yes, yes.
I remember Stephens but I'm not too sure whether he remembers me.
Of course I do, Mr. Pennybaker.
How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
- And how are the children?
Mark and Sylvia, your little 3-year-old Willie?
Well, they're just fine.
And call me Ed.
Well, thank you, Ed.
Ed was telling me fascinating things about his parakeets.
Yes, I've got a bird that picks up a new word every week.
There's no telling how far that bird can go.
I remember reading in the dentist's office about a budgerigar or a budgie, as they're called, owned by an English woman.
That bird knew and had a vocabulary of over 300 words.
- Oh, come off it, Darrin.
- No.
No, no.
He's right.
I know about that bird.
I didn't know you were a budgie man.
I'm not, I'm not.
I just remember reading about it in the dentist's office.
The bird was called Sandy and was owned by Mrs. Irene Pauls of Staines, in Middlesex.
Yes, yes.
Beautiful country, Middlesex.
You know, I drove through there on my way down to London from Manchester.
Excuse me for correcting you, Ed but that would be the Midlands, not Middlesex.
Thank you very much, Stephens.
Is it possible to do a little constructive work around here?
Oh, sure, Ed.
Sure.
That's no good.
Wait a minute.
Now, here's something I like.
Simple, plain almost Baroque.
Oh, excuse me, Ed, but if memory serves me the Baroque period in art was highly ornamental.
It followed the Renaissance and found its extreme expression in the Rococo.
What are you doing, taking extension courses in everything?
- Knock it off, will you, Darrin?
- Sorry, Larry.
Just popped into my mind.
Art 101, Professor Eckhart.
Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 10:00.
I got a B minus.
He had a good-looking daughter.
Darrin, you're flunking your postgraduate course in advertising.
Sorry.
Sorry, Ed.
Here we are.
Well, I'll tell you something I discovered about Larry.
He doesn't like for me to charge things.
He'd rather give me the cash.
It seems to give him a sense of power and of being charitable to me.
- Very interesting.
- Louise.
- Hi.
- How are you, dear?
I know what you want.
Just tell me how much.
Oh, this is Mr. Pennybaker, our favourite client.
- My wife Louise and Mrs. Stephens.
- How are you?
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
Darrin was telling me about you.
I hear you have three wonderful children.
Oh, yes, I do indeed.
And you know, it's a pleasure working with your husband.
- Will this be enough, darling?
- Without looking, no.
Mr. Pennybaker, if you and your wife aren't busy, join us for dinner tonight.
- Well, that would be fine.
- Oh, good, good.
Samantha, we'll expect you and Darrin too.
Just a minute.
I believe it's our turn.
Oh, yes.
Yes, please let us do it.
Darrin, it isn't your turn at all.
You have a rain check from Thursday, month before last when we invited you, and you didn't show.
Well, I didn't hear a thing about it.
Next time you want us for dinner, you just call me.
Don't tell your husband to tell my husband.
Wait a minute.
Darrin didn't tell me about a dinner date.
- I'd never forget that.
- Are you saying I didn't tell you?
Sweetheart, even if you did, it doesn't make any difference.
I tell you, I told him.
Let me see.
Now I remember.
After I told him, he made a note of it in the margin of a sketch for the McCollins account.
Marvellous.
He even remembers things that never happened.
Oh, Larry, if that's the way it's going to be.
You want proof, huh?
Okay.
Okay, okay.
Yes, Mr. Tate?
This is Mr. Stephens, Betty.
- Send in the McCollins account.
- Yes, sir.
Oh, Darrin, don't.
Louise, I really wasn't upset.
I just assumed that Darrin forgot to tell Larry.
That's another reason I want to get this settled.
- Men, men.
- Thank you, Betty.
There we are.
"Dinner with the Stephenses, Thursday, 7:00".
Let me see that.
- That is your handwriting, dear.
- Well, what if it is?
- What does that prove?
- See, I did remember to tell him.
Oh, Samantha, it was our fault.
I'm dreadfully sorry.
Don't be silly, Louise.
This whole thing is ridiculous.
- Larry?
- I'm sorry, Samantha.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you, Louise.
Mr. Pennybaker, if you're wondering where you're having dinner, it's at our house.
- All right, Louise?
- Anything, but let's go shopping.
Yes, well, l I think I'd better go too.
I'll walk you ladies out.
You know, not too long ago a dispute like this could have ended on the duelling field.
Everything according to the code duello.
Ladies, you probably don't know this but the duelling code has a very interesting history.
Now, you take the age of chivalry.
A gentleman in those days - Pleased with yourself?
- Well, I'm sorry, Larry.
You've been bugging me about my memory.
I've been trying to improve it.
I know Ed Pennybaker.
He considers himself an authority on everything.
- He likes to be on.
- I didn't notice.
How could you?
You were talking all the time.
Larry, you've got to admit that I did remember every detail of his account.
Yes.
Yes.
Now I wish you would go to your office and practise a little forgetting.
I can't.
That's the wonderful thing, I can't.
And, Larry, I want to thank you for insisting that I improve my memory.
Thanks, Lar.
Oh, I'm slow.
English literature room 314, new annex building.
"The Destruction of Sennacherib," by Lord Byron.
The Assyrian came down Lik e the wolf on the fold His cohorts were gleaming In purple and gold The stockings were hung By the chimney with care In hopes that St. Nicholas Soon would be there?
It's not total recall yet.
- Mr. Stephens?
- Yes, Betty?
I have this international-products letter for you to sign.
Oh, good.
Betty, you have a semicolon here in the fourth sentence where I dictated a colon.
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- It's all right.
You can fix it.
Oh, fine.
- Send that right out.
- Thank you.
Which reminds me That's the fourth time this year you've made the same mistake.
The first time was in February in a letter to the Frisbee account.
Then the second time was concerning the Rohrbach account.
That was on April the 12.
And most recently, it was in a letter to Clyde, Burke and Weil.
Only this time you made the same mistake in reverse a colon instead of semicolon.
Better watch that.
Yes, sir.
It's coming back.
It's coming back.
Let me guess.
- Go ahead.
- The milkman?
Right.
How about paying your bill, lady?
There.
Where's my change?
Oh, Darrin, they're lovely.
What's the occasion?
It's an anniversary.
- Of what?
- Our first quarrel.
How very thoughtful of you.
I was remembering how nice it was making up afterwards.
Yes, that was nice.
Thank you.
I remember I took you to dinner, the theatre and dancing afterward.
Oh, yes.
You were so charming and gallant.
Remember the funny little waiter with the toupee?
You were very romantic too.
And the bandleader who was smashed out of his skull?
No, but I remember how sweet you were Oh, honey, you must remember him.
They had him propped up between two music stands.
It was the night we had the fight.
It started Darrin, I can't remember what the fight was about.
I can.
It was the time you were going to meet me outside my office building and you were waiting at the wrong entrance which left me standing for one solid hour in the pouring rain.
You do remember that, don't you?
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Why did you go to the side entrance?
You always go to the front entrance, and that's where I waited.
I was waiting there because you asked me to meet you there.
Why would I do a thing like that?
You made a mistake.
You were just too wet and irritable to admit it.
It was for your convenience For your convenience that I was there.
You were doing some shopping in that dress store on the side street.
That's ridiculous.
That shop never had anything I wanted.
For your information, that was the day and place where you bought that yellow dress that you gave to the rummage committee along with that chocolate cake that you whipped up.
- Don't raise your voice like that to me.
- There, you see?
You always say that whenever I'm right, and I'm right, aren't I?
All right.
You're right.
Here.
Take your raggedy old flowers and press them in your dumb, old instant-memory book.
Well, if it's wrong for a man to try to improve himself to study hard to get ahead in his job so that he can do better by his wife and child, well Darrin, I'm sorry.
Don't you think you've improved your memory enough?
Can't you just forget about the rest of the book?
Samantha, if it weren't for that book, I wouldn't have remembered our first quarrel and brought you flowers.
And we wouldn't be having this brand-new fight.
I'm sorry.
They're lovely.
And I love you very much.
I love you very much.
Oh, that makes it all worthwhile.
Which reminds me of the time Listen.
But none of you remember the really early cars.
Now, I mean the first ones.
For instance, who remembers the Lexington Minute Man?
Now, there It was a four-cylinder, four-passenger sports car, early 1900s.
But the interesting thing is it had bucket seats.
My great-aunt Emma had one.
Hadn't thought of it in years.
Now, that's all right, as far as you went.
But the valve system Ed, to be completely accurate the Lexington was hardly one of your first cars.
After all, the internal combustion engine the first patent was taken out in 1886 by Gottlieb Daimler and credit is given to a man named Krebs for all the features we find in today's modern car.
- He designed the Panhard in 1894 - Right.
Would you mind refilling my glass?
Darling, since when have you been so interested in old cars?
I was wondering that myself.
Well, I'm not.
But I was doing some research on automobiles for a motor-car campaign we were doing back on June 16, 1963 and I just picked up a little information.
Picked up?
You made a career of it.
My refill, please?
Yes.
Ed, Ed, Darrin tells me that you're quite a music lover.
Yes, Ed, tell us about it.
Well, I must say, I do pride myself on my knowledge of Does your husband know music, Samantha?
- Not really, no.
- We hope.
Well, you see, I'm particularly interested in that creative giant, Ludwig van Beethoven.
Beethoven?
How nice.
You know, there's an enduring vitality in all the great music of the classical period.
Now, you take Beethoven Excuse me, Ed, but as I understand it Beethoven was what we call a transition composer.
Darrin.
Now, the composers of your classical period were Haydn, Mozart.
Your romantic composers, Chopin, Schumann.
Beethoven and Schubert they came in between, therefore "transition," QED.
Your husband doesn't know music?
I don't.
Just something I picked up from the notes on a record album.
You remember, Louise, the album of symphony favourites you gave to me eight years ago.
So now it's our fault, huh?
Ed, Larry's been thinking of putting in a wine cellar and we don't know anything about it.
I wondered if you could advise us on anything we should get.
Oh, boy.
As a matter of fact There's something about French wines I'll bet none of you know.
In 1875 - Darrin.
- In a moment, dear.
- There was a blight in the French vineyards.
Darrin, I'd like to see you in the kitchen.
Right now.
Well, excuse me, folks.
Back in a minute.
Why don't you take over, Ed?
Thank you.
Now, about that wine cellar.
That's something I really know.
We built one.
Well, what has gotten into you?
Honey, isn't it marvellous?
Only a few sessions with that book and my memory's increased a thousand percent.
- What will it be like after I finish it?
- I dread the thought.
What do you mean?
Don't you see that Ed's just about ready to kill you?
Why?
We have so many interests in common.
Honey, can't you see?
Isn't it exciting?
It's total recall, that's what it is.
And your mother thought I couldn't handle it.
My mother?
I haven't seen my mother in two weeks.
But Darrin has.
Mother?
Mother.
- Well - Unbearable, isn't he?
You did it, didn't you?
I warned him he'd be impossible to live with.
You mean, he asked you for the power?
No, no.
He thinks he's doing the whole thing with that pointed head of his.
And may I say he's on the way to becoming the champion bore of the world.
You take that spell off him.
But, Samantha, I didn't put the spell on him.
Witch's honour.
If you didn't put a spell on him then it must be something he has with him, some object.
What?
That's for me to know and you to find out.
It's a nice little challenge for you, dear.
Something he's wearing?
Something he has with him all the time?
Let me know how it comes out.
I'm taking off to Rio.
Really.
Something, something.
No, no, Ed.
It wasn't that way at all, if you'll excuse me.
Columbia came to the Rose Bowl to play Stanford.
Nobody gave them a chance.
They played the game in a pouring rain.
It was a scoreless tie in the fourth quarter.
My Uncle Max told me all about it when I was a little kid.
Columbia's coach, Lou Little, had worked out a key play.
At the right moment, Columbia's quarterback faded back with the ball, and he threw it.
Oh, I'll get it, Darrin.
You tell Ed all about it.
Well, he threw it to What's his name?
It's right on the tip of my tongue.
What is his name, Ed?
Help me.
His name was Barabas, Al Barabas.
He scored a touchdown, they converted the final score was 7 to nothing and you lost $35 to Jess Wallach when you couldn't afford it.
- How about that?
- Yes.
- Well, how'd you know that, Cynthia?
- Well, I don't know.
Yes, I do.
I've heard that story Let's see, Ed and I have been married 15 years.
He's told the story at least twice a week.
That means I would have heard it at least 1560 times.
- What?
- Oh, I know his fishing story as well.
He's only told that 1422 times.
- All right, Cynthia.
- Oh, just a minute, darling.
How would you like to hear about orchid raising?
He just started that 10 years ago, so he's only told that 836 times.
I didn't realize that I monopolize the conversation.
But you do, darling.
Oh, let me tell you about our 10th anniversary.
We decided to go back to Niagara Falls to recapture romance.
We had a lovely view of the falls.
I saw them, but I never heard them.
There was something drowning them out.
Cynthia.
I'm sorry, Ed.
I shouldn't have said all that.
But suddenly something came over me and, all of a sudden, everything came back.
Was I as bad as that?
I didn't realize.
You mean, I go on and on and on about anything, everything the way he does?
Oh, gee, everybody, I'm sorry if I was talking too much.
Sam, was I?
Samantha, why don't you give Darrin and Ed something else to think about.
Like, maybe some food for thought?
Oh, that's an excellent idea, Larry.
Well, if memory serves, dinner is ready.
- Morning, sweetheart.
- Morning.
Honey, where's my instant-memory book?
Darrin, after all we've been through, what do you want that thing for?
I misplaced my watch.
I thought a quick review would help me remember where I left it.
Oh, well, I took it.
The strap was broken.
I'm gonna have it fixed.
I forgot to tell you.
You see?
It's my memory, not yours.
I have a strange feeling there is something wrong with my memory.
All that total recall couldn't be entirely from that book.
What conversation did I have with your mother that slipped my mind like I wish every conversation with your mother would?
You suspect my mother?
Why, Darrin, I find that hard to believe.
I bet you find it harder to deny.
Much harder.
But I love you so could you try and forget about Mother and memory and remembering, and concentrate on that?
A cinch.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Samantha?
Oh, that's my own little witch.
Well done.
Darrin, you better hurry up.
Breakfast is almost ready.
I know.
I just saw it in action.
That's very clever, the way the pancakes flip-flop, flip-flop.
No hands.
Welcome back to the fold, darling.
I sort of broke training.
I noticed.
What about Dumbo?
Doesn't he object to your using?
Yes, Darrin objects.
It's a special occasion because of the morning light.
I have to catch the morning light so I can work on my painting.
Really?
Your painting?
See?
I've almost finished the sketch.
I'm gonna enter it in the exhibit next week.
Paint the way you flipped pancakes, you'll have a masterpiece.
Mother, I am not going to use witchcraft.
Well, remember, anything less than a masterpiece will be a disgrace to the family name.
And I'll be watching.
Mother.
Okay, push.
That's a good girl.
Wait a minute.
Just wait a minute.
Come on No.
Now, come on.
No.
As soon as I call your daddy, I'll fix you something to eat.
Well, there you are.
I've been waiting for hours.
Well, I'm sorry, Mother, but I've been very busy delivering my painting.
Your painting?
Yes.
My painting.
For your information my painting is gonna be hung at the charity exhibit.
- It might even win a prize.
- Well, that wouldn't surprise me.
- It wouldn't?
- No, of course not.
Talent runs in our family.
Your great-great-uncle Lorenzo was hung in the Louvre.
Mother, really, not in front of Tabatha.
Not him, silly child.
His self-portrait.
And your second cousin Lucretia has worked in stone for centuries.
I've often felt that Durwood should lend her his head.
I have often felt that we can do without the jokes about Darrin.
D-A-R-R-l-N.
He, incidentally, thinks my painting's great.
That is incidental.
What would Whatchamacallit know about art?
If you want an opinion of value you should go to someone who's aesthetically equipped to give you a critique of your work.
Whom did you have in mind?
As if I didn't know.
Oh, don't be flippant, my dear daughter.
You know I frequently haunt the avant-garde galleries.
As a matter of fact, I dropped in at Jacques' Gallery in New York to see the work of Henri Monchet.
- Who is Henri Monchet?
- Henri Monchet?
Henri Monchet happens to be the latest rage in Paris.
And mark you, soon he'll be the rage in New York.
Well, I'm very impressed.
Good.
Now let's see if I am.
- What?
- Let me see your painting.
No, it's too late.
It's hanging in the gallery at the university.
I told you I'd dropped it off.
It's going to appear in public before your own mother sees it?
You bet.
We artists live dangerously.
Life with that mortal has made you completely thoughtless.
How's that?
I got news.
I think you hung it upside down.
So what?
Eggs is better over easy anyhow.
Eggs make me hungry.
Let's eat.
It's too early for lunch.
Not when you been hanging eggs all morning.
Come on, let's eat.
Okay.
Better lock the door.
All right.
- What you got, salami?
- Liverwurst.
Always liverwurst on Thursday.
Hey.
How did she get in?
Sorry, lady.
But the show don't start till tonight.
So if you don't mind, will you please blow?
Of course.
Lady, watch out.
Did you see what I saw?
- No.
- Good.
Neither did I. My stars and satellites!
It looks like she's painted it with a broom.
A whisk broom.
Well, we can do better than that.
Oh, wizards and warlocks Of arts of the ages Oh, palettes of paint And classical sages This dreadful still life, Just tak e it away And bring me a landscape By Henri Monchet Well, that's more like it.
Oh, fiddley-faddley, I almost forgot.
There.
Now.
Well, now that's what I call an excellent job.
Where did that lady go?
- What lady?
- That's the one.
Darrin, it's almost 5:00.
How's that perfume layout coming along?
Here, have a sniff.
Well, these look fine, Darrin.
A few changes to make before Cunningham sees it.
Take your time.
He can see it tomorrow.
You can tell him about it tonight.
What do you mean, I can tell him about it tonight?
He arrived in town early.
- You're taking him to dinner.
- Not tonight, I'm not.
I have very special plans.
I'm taking my wife to dinner.
By all means bring Sam along.
She's always a plus in client relationships.
Larry, you're not paying attention.
Sam has a painting in the art exhibit at the university.
- We have to go there.
- But that's great!
Cunningham considers himself a connoisseur of the arts.
- He'd jump at the chance to go.
- An amateur art exhibit?
This is the first thing Sam's ever painted.
- Have I ever steered you wrong?
- You wanna stand on your record?
- No.
- Why don't you take him to dinner?
We have other plans, and because the Cunningham perfume account can be the most lucrative we've ever had, and taking him to the exhibit can be the one sure-fire way of getting it.
So call Sam, give her the good word.
- Okay.
First I have to think of one.
- What?
- A good word.
- Why don't you tell her it's a favour for the president of the company?
That's a good word.
Good evening, madam.
Your chief babysitter, reporting for duty.
Not a minute too soon.
If I don't leave right away, I'll be late.
There's something else I had to do.
What was it?
Yes.
Mr. Cunningham's perfume.
He sent some to Louise and me.
Fifty dollars an ounce.
Mother, look at me.
I'm so nervous, it's like stage fright.
Don't worry, darling.
I'll be with you in spirit.
- Wish me luck.
- It's been wished.
- What does that mean?
- Oh, really, Samantha.
It's getting so you question everything I say.
Sorry.
Bye-bye.
Fifty dollars an ounce?
On the local side of the news, art critic Arthur Bryan has completed his judging in the charity art show on view at the university tonight.
The winner of the first prize is Samantha Stephens.
- Larry!
- In making the decision Mr. Bryan said Mrs. Stephens showed an amazing colour sense and style Larry!
Samantha won first prize!
Can't hear you, dear.
Well, hurry up.
We must go to that exhibit.
Now for a rundown in the world of sports.
- What is it?
- She won.
Samantha won.
- Stunned a capacity crowd, setting a new world's record for the high jump.
Yeah?
How high did she jump?
And so you say, "What is art"?
Some say look in the dictionary, but I say what does a man who writes a dictionary know about art?
If he knew about art, would he be writing a dictionary in the first place?
No, I say.
I say, go to a man who has created something himself.
Even if that man is only a man like I. A man who has created a perfume, go to him, I say.
That man knows art as I know art.
And what does it take to know art, you ask?
- No, I didn't.
- She didn't say anything.
That is not an easy question to answer.
Thought you hit me with a toughie didn't you?
For the ordinary man, that is a difficult question.
But, and I use the word "but" advisedly, but for a man like I who has a sense of recognition a man who can sniff a fragrance or walk up to a painting and say, "I know you" there is the essence of knowing art.
- Fascinating.
- Yes, isn't it?
I'm afraid that our exhibit is considerably below your speed, Mr. Cunningham.
I mean, it's for kitchen creators, patio painters, like I. I mean, we wouldn't be on exhibit at all if it weren't for charity.
- All the more reason.
- All the more reason, what?
To know what you want and go after it.
Once I say, "I know you," the next step is, "I must have you".
I have never, never in my entire life said: "I know you" to a painting or a fragrance I didn't buy.
I will say that for me.
I always get what I want.
Always.
- Wow.
- That is why my art collection is second only to about three or 400 others in the United States.
Don't you think it's getting a wee bit late?
Yes.
Waiter?
They're putting the prize-winning paintings up for sale.
- You might see something you like.
- At an amateur exhibit, I doubt it.
But who knows?
I'm always on the lookout for new discoveries.
Well, I'm afraid mine won't be one.
I don't know.
Samantha.
Samantha, how wonderful.
I'm so thrilled for you.
Good to see you again.
I wouldn't have missed this for the world.
Darrin, you must be very proud of her.
When Louise heard the news, we cancelled and came right over.
- What news?
- Yeah, what news?
You mean you don't know?
Samantha won first prize.
They're unveiling her painting any moment.
Well, now, this is interesting.
Oh, Louise, are you sure?
Well, I can't believe it.
You're positive?
I'm numb.
Well, who wouldn't be?
I'm dying to see your masterpiece.
They've been waiting for you.
We saved some seats.
Come on over.
Here.
Mrs. Stephens, as chairman of the art committee, I just want to say how proud we are to have you here.
Thank you.
Hang on, I may go right through the floor.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, as we promised you the first painting to be auctioned for charity is the painting that won first prize.
We'll invite our guests to examine the painting before the auction begins.
- Sam, that isn't yours.
- I know.
- Mr. Chairman - Honey, honey.
The signature.
Look at the signature.
Mrs. Stephens, I'm not used to paintings at amateur exhibits saying "I know you" but that one definitely is speaking up.
I wish it would say where it came from.
All right.
Your attention, please.
The bidding is about to commence.
- Now, do I hear an offer?
- I have an awful feeling - Twenty-five dollars.
- That he's going to bid for it.
- He just did.
- Thirty.
Thirty-five.
That may be my signature, but it's Mother's handwriting.
You bid against him.
I'll see if I can figure this out.
Thirty-five once thirty-five twice Thirty-six!
Ah, now I have a bid for $36.
You people in the back there, I haven't heard from you.
- Mr. Higgins, do you bid?
- Mother?
Oh, I get the hint, Stephens.
I forgot it was for charity.
Don't worry, Stephens.
I'll go along.
- Two hundred dollars.
- Now I have a bid for $200.
Do I hear more?
Two hundred once two hundred twice Three hundred dollars.
Three hundred dollars.
- Do I hear four?
- Four hundred dollars.
Stephens, I want that painting.
Yes, Darrin.
What is this?
He wants that painting.
- I'm sentimental.
- You weren't sentimental a while ago when you could have had it for $25.
I'm a man of many moods.
Four hundred once four hundred twice - Four hundred and ten?
- I have 410.
Do I hear 500?
Five hundred.
I know you can hear me.
How could you do such a thing?
Will you please answer me?
It's urgent.
Oh, Mother, you are such a stubborn witch.
I have $800.
- Do I hear 850?
- I don't think so.
Eight-fifty.
Darrin, be sentimental over her next painting.
Please keep out of this.
I thought you people wanted my account.
Nine hundred dollars.
We do.
But that's business.
This is art.
This is nonsense, Darrin.
You can have all the paintings Sam can paint.
- Why do you have to have this one?
- You'd never understand.
Nine hundred and twenty-five dollars.
I could leave town tonight.
Me without the painting, and you without my account.
Nine hundred and fifty dollars.
Nine hundred and fifty dollars.
Do I hear a thousand?
Where are you gonna get a thousand dollars without a job?
One thousand dollars.
One thousand and five dollars.
One thousand and five dollars.
Going once going twice sold, for $1005.
To the art lover in the grey suit.
I told you I get what I want, if I have to say so myself.
- Mr. Cunningham.
- I call this good sportsmanship Darrin inviting us all over for coffee.
Yes, he's a gracious loser, and I'm a gracious winner for $1005.
One thousand and five dollars?
I suppose I can't really blame you for wanting your wife's painting so badly.
I suppose.
Samantha and I'll get things started in the kitchen.
- Let me.
- No, Louise.
You and Larry entertain Mr. Cunningham.
Mother.
Dear.
I'm desperate.
Mother, I have to talk to you.
Now, for the last time, you materialize, or else.
Well, why didn't you answer me before?
You knew I was here babysitting.
I also know you could've gotten Aunt Hagatha as a substitute.
I knew you'd make a great to-do over nothing and you are, aren't you?
Where'd you get that painting?
Oh, that?
That's Henri Monchet's.
Henri Monchet?
You stole it.
Samantha, that's a tawdry accusation.
Of course I haven't.
I just borrowed it.
It'll pop back to Jacques' at midnight.
Midnight?
But it's close to that now.
Oh, really?
Oh, I am late.
Mother, you are going to sit right there on that table until this mess is cleared up.
Mr. Cunningham is in there, and he bought that painting!
Don't tell me that scent-maker is here!
I tried some of his perfume.
It burned a hole right through my robe.
You should try some of my perfume, Samantha.
It's irresistible.
It was made especially for me by a warlock in Tibet.
- Irresistible?
- Completely.
But I'll need it for tonight.
No, Mother, I'll need it for tonight.
Oh, please?
Please let me borrow it.
Please?
Oh, fiddle-faddle.
Why don't you leave the painting here?
We'll have it reframed, show it off better.
- You don't want to part with it, do you?
- Louise.
- Larry.
- No, thanks.
Mrs. Stephens.
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Cunningham.
Cream and sugar?
That perfume you're wearing.
What is it?
Oh, that.
My mother makes it.
Homemade perfume?
Well, it's an old formula.
Been in the family for years.
What a unique fragrance.
That scent.
Remarkable, fabulous aroma.
It's speaking to me.
I'm glad you like it.
- Like it?
I must market it.
- Great.
- What are the ingredients?
- Mother would never tell anyone.
I'm prepared to make a very generous offer to her if she'll sell it to me.
- She'd never sell it for money.
- What else is there?
I happen to know that Mother would love Darrin to have that painting.
Perhaps we could work out a trade.
No, no.
I don't think so.
Cookie?
That scent is irresistible.
Are you sure your mother won't accept a large payment?
Absolutely not.
You have a very unusual mother-in-law, my boy.
Indescribable.
- Louise.
- And so is that perfume.
It's a deal.
The painting for the formula.
Darrin, won't you take the painting in the den?
- Now?
- Right now.
Before Mr. Cunningham changes his mind.
Why, with this new fragrance, I may start a whole new line.
Naturally, Mr. Cunningham, I'll have Stephens get started on a new layout.
- That sounds like fun.
- I'll want excitement.
Something to make it impossible for a woman not to buy it when she sees it.
We'll need a name that will make it as irresistible as it is.
I have an idea.
How about, "I Know You".
Brilliant.
Stephens, what did you ever do to deserve a woman like this?
Mr. Cunningham, I'll never know.
- Well, good night.
- Darrin, see you bright and early.
- Right, Larry.
- Mr. Cunningham.
- Better get on the ball.
- Believe me, I've got ideas.
It's just wonderful the way everything worked out.
You didn't get the painting, but you got the perfume.
McMann and Tate got the account which is all Larry was worried about, right?
Just a minute.
Just a gosh-darn minute.
Louise, will you ever learn to keep your big, fat?
And were you going to keep this a secret from me?
Keep what a secret from you, Mr. Cunningham?
"Samantha Stephens".
So that wasn't your only painting.
Or your only style.
This one I've got to have, because this one is talking up a storm.
It's shouting at me.
This one I know.
Mr. Cunningham, that one you may have.
You mean it?
Quick, say good night before she changes her mind.
- Good night.
Call you tomorrow!
- Good night, good night.
Sam, that painting.
Is it gonna disappear?
- Is it real?
Or was that witchcraft too?
- I told you this morning it was real.
It's getting harder and harder to tell what's real and what isn't around here.
Come here.
This is real.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Good.
Darrin?
Charlie.
Charlie Harper!
It's great to see you, old buddy!
Darrin, if you don't stop poking around, you won't even make dessert.
- I'll be a minute.
- That's what you said 30 minutes ago.
Something tells me you're not too anxious to see your old buddy.
Not anxious?
Don't be ridiculous.
He happens to be one of the greatest guys alive.
He'd be perfect except for one minor thing.
What's that?
He's rich, bright, intelligent, charming and witty.
He excels at everything.
Anything anybody can do Charlie can do better.
Outside that, a sweetheart.
Sounds horrible.
I'll hate him.
Impossible.
Nobody can hate Charlie.
Not even me.
Don't think I haven't tried.
Well, I bet he didn't graduate cum laude the way you did.
- No, he didn't.
- There, you see?
He did better.
He graduated summa cum laude.
And he was three years younger.
Well Hold it.
You were elected student body president, weren't you?
Only after Charlie resigned so he could devote time to being the most popular man on campus.
You can't tell me Charlie was any more popular with the girls than you were.
Let's put it this way.
I beat them off with a stick.
Charlie had his own woodpile.
- What's his wife like?
- I never met her.
But if she's married to Charlie, she's got to be gorgeous.
- There they are.
I'll get it.
- Darrin.
I think your legs are cute but I imagine the Harpers would prefer to see you in pants.
See?
He even beat me getting dressed.
How can people say they don't know what angels look like?
She's beautiful, Dar.
Really something special.
Thank you, Charlie.
And you're right.
Tabatha's very special.
- Do you have any children?
- You'll be sorry you asked.
There they are.
- Triplets.
- Triplets?
It figures.
Yes.
Two girls and a boy.
It's a little hard to tell because of the hair.
As Charlie is fond of saying, " If you're going to do something, do it right".
- They're darling, aren't they, Darrin?
- They certainly are.
Instead of cigars, I passed out pipes.
Why don't we all go down to dinner?
You know, Dar, I really like your place.
It has a good, solid home feel.
- Who was your decorator?
- You're looking at her.
I envy you.
I really botched our winter place in Acapulco something fierce.
Sam's got a real flair.
She can do wonders with anything.
She and Charlie should get together.
He did a fabulous job on our castle.
You have a castle?
I fell in love with it the minute I saw the moat.
If Charlie hadn't bought it, I would have died.
It's just a small one in Majorca.
Say, Dar, I hear you're going great guns at McMann & Tate.
Yes.
He's head of their creative advertising.
Hey, that's great.
Congratulations, Dar.
Well, thank you.
Some of my accounts have come off pretty well.
- Caldwell Soup, for instance.
- Upped the sales 27 percent.
How marvellous.
Darling, don't you have something to do with advertising?
- In a small way.
Well, I thought you bought two big agencies last summer.
Just one.
Was that 20th Century Limited, or am I thinking of the train?
You're close, honey.
It was Brown and Smithers Unlimited.
You bought Brown and Smithers?
Just for tax purposes.
I really don't know anything about the advertising game itself.
Well, shall we all go into the living room, where it's more comfortable?
I'll get the liqueur and be right in.
Okay?
"I fell in love with it the minute I saw the moat".
I'm not impressed.
I'm beginning to believe the only thing they don't own is this block.
Mother!
What are you doing here?
Being sick.
You're eating like you feel fine.
Well, you know what they say: "Starve a success, feed a frustration".
No one I know says that.
Have you any idea how you sounded while you were trying to puff up Duncan's meagre triumphs?
It's "Darrin," and you know it.
When are you going to admit he's not good enough for you?
The day after never.
Darrin's doing just fine.
And I love him, remember?
Well, if you had to marry a mortal why couldn't you have chosen a superior one?
Like Charlie.
I don't have to stand here and listen to you applaud Charlie's accomplishments.
I can go out there and listen to Daphne do it.
Oh, Samantha, face it.
She's not bragging.
She's simply stating fact.
Mother?
I hope you get fat.
I hope you didn't have anything to do with that meat-company jingle.
You know, "Our tongue speaks for itself".
Not guilty.
Charlie and I had a bet coming here.
He said that you would remember me, and I said that you wouldn't.
And you lose, right, Dar?
Well, let me think.
See there?
I was right.
I was the freshman campus queen your entire senior year of college.
Yes, yes, of course.
How are you?
Fine, thank you.
And I must say that your husband was the only red-blooded male Thank you.
- That didn't chase me around the quad.
I just didn't want to get trampled in the rush.
He also has a bad knee.
Kids, I have a wonderful idea.
We've opened our house at Oyster Bay and we're having friends out for the weekend.
You're coming too.
We'll have a ball.
Tennis, swimming, golf.
The whole bit.
- Well, l - And, Dar you and I are going to talk some business.
Important business involving you.
Now, what do you say?
Well, it sounds great, Charlie.
Doesn't it, honey?
Can we get a babysitter on such short notice?
Well, I'm sure that Mother is available.
Well, if she isn't, I suppose I could always get Aunt Clara to pop in.
Oh, that's great.
Then it's all settled.
Go upstairs and throw some things into a suitcase.
The limousine's right out front, we can go together.
- Sweetheart, I'm proud of you.
- Why?
Because I agreed to let your mother babysit?
That does take courage.
So does letting yourself in for a one-upmanship weekend like this.
It's a shade over, above and beyond the call of duty.
Oh, we'll have fun.
Anyway, I told you I like Charlie.
It's his wife who keeps pouring it on.
You really didn't remember Daphne?
Not a bit.
It's weird.
You don't suppose she was a bit of a snob even then, do you?
Castle, indeed.
Why shouldn't she have a castle?
Charlie can afford it.
I wish I could give you one.
Don't.
They're drafty.
You have a wicked slam, senator.
Yes, my dear, but I wish my wife had your form.
When the countess told me we missed you in Monte Carlo, I was just sick.
Yes.
Excuse me, Mrs. Harper, but I see Samantha's ready for me again.
Dar, I'm afraid you've got me beaten.
Not yet, Charlie.
Not if you get a bull's-eye.
Fat chance.
I haven't gotten one in three weeks.
Well, here goes.
Would you take a look at that.
Do I have to?
I'm afraid Louis isn't concentrating on the game, but she's such a lovely girl.
Yes, really lovely.
You know, our husbands went to college together and I'm just trying to get Charlie to give him a decent job.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Having fun?
First Charlie beat me at eight ball, then at darts, now across the pool.
- Sorry.
- Yeah.
Oh, wonderful, Samantha.
You've set them again.
Sorry, sweetheart.
Oh, my, Samantha.
What a stunning ring.
Oh, thank you.
Darrin picked it out himself.
It's so stark and modern.
I tried to tell Charlie that the trend was away from the big diamonds, but he's so old-fashioned.
And of course he can afford to be.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I don't know how I could have been so clumsy.
Maybe the cards caught on your ring.
Senator, I tell you, Darrin made a shot today that was What?
Well, "incredible" is the only word for it.
- Now, Charlie - No false modesty, Dar.
It was fantastic.
See, he's already found another word.
Well, who won?
Charlie.
By 11 strokes.
- Let's you and I talk business.
- Okay.
Excuse us.
Tell me, Darrin, are you happy at McMann & Tate?
- Very happy.
- Oh, that's too bad.
It would be easier to quit miserable.
Why should I wanna quit?
You can't stay there and be president of Brown and Smithers Unlimited too.
You're not serious?
You can write your own ticket, Dar.
That's how serious I am.
Well, Charlie, I don't know what to say.
The word is "yes".
You'll spend six months in New York and six months on the Continent.
That's to service our offices in Paris, London and Rome.
Samantha will love it.
- Oh, I don't think so, Charlie.
- Well, why not?
First of all, it would mean uprooting the family and schools for Tabatha.
Besides, I couldn't leave Larry Tate after all he's done for me.
Anyway, I'm simply not ready for a presidency.
You're too modest, Dar.
You always have been.
- Can you suggest anybody else?
- Why not yourself?
Hey, come on.
I'm much too smart to hire anybody like me.
Come in.
- Oh, hi, Daphne.
- Hi, Samantha.
You packed in a hurry.
I was wondering if you want to borrow anything.
Clothes or jewellery, anything like that?
Oh, that's very sweet.
But I think I brought enough.
Okay.
Well, the boys really are enjoying themselves, aren't they?
Darrin's having a ball.
That's lovely.
You know, Charlie and I love Darrin and we just wish we could help him.
Help him what?
Oh, to realize his full potential and to find his proper place in the world.
Oh, Daphne.
I think Darrin's very happy with his place his home, his family, his job at McMann & Tate.
I know, but Charlie could make him vice president in his agency.
But then again, Darrin probably wouldn't accept it.
He likes to do things on his own.
I'm sure when the time is right he will be offered a vice presidency.
Oh, how wonderful.
How wonderful.
You're sure there's nothing I can lend you this evening?
It's gonna be very dressy.
Maybe some jewellery or Well, let me look.
Oh, Samantha.
How lovely.
It's amazing what they can do with this costume stuff these days, isn't it?
What makes you think they're not real?
You force me to be cruel.
On Darrin's salary, they have to be zircons.
Oh, I mean, they're beautiful zircons.
They're the prettiest I've ever seen.
Daphne, there is one thing I could use.
- A hanger.
- Oh, I'll have Hilda bring you some.
I really should hang this thing up.
Samantha, that is the most gorgeous, breathtakingly beau Daphne?
Is anything wrong?
Yes, my darling daughter.
There's plenty wrong.
- Mother!
- Samantha.
I'm appalled.
Oh, Mother, what is it now, and who's staying with Tabatha?
I suspected you needed keeping an eye on more than Tabatha.
Hagatha is with her.
I'm watching over the real baby of the family.
Oh, Samantha.
Boasting about Durwood is one thing but conjuring up a precious item like that it's the biggest misuse of witchcraft I have ever seen.
Well.
Since when have you been so averse to my using witchcraft?
The second you started using it to make Dalton look good.
- Daphne had it coming.
- I couldn't care less about her.
It's you I'm concerned about.
You're only fooling yourself, Samantha, and the mink proves it.
You had to zap it up for yourself because what's-his-name isn't capable of getting you one.
Don't you see that?
Well, I don't need a mink.
I suppose I shouldn't have done it.
It's apt to get me into trouble.
From the lustful look in her eye I would say that is in the nature of an understatement.
If you just unfreeze her and pop out, I'll see if I can remedy the situation.
Well, easier said, darling.
Cheerio.
- Beautiful, fabulous coat that I have ever seen.
- May I?
- Oh, yes.
Did Darrin give it to you?
Where did he get it?
From a place going out of business.
With merchandise like this?
Well, you see, Daphne, that was the problem.
They took too much trouble.
Raised the mink themselves.
And only used the pelts from identical twins from each litter.
There's probably not another one like it in the whole world.
No, no, there isn't.
Darrin could just shoot me for not liking it.
- For not liking it?
- Well, I hardly ever wear it.
It's a sore subject with Darrin.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't mention it.
- Oh, darling, you can count on me.
- Good.
Oh, how stupid of me.
Charlie, you've got to get that mink coat for me.
You have a closet full of those.
But this is made out of the pelts of identical twins.
If this coat is so special, honey, well, why doesn't Samantha like it?
Don't be so dense.
She knows they can't afford it.
Yeah, but I'd feel funny.
You'd be doing Darrin a favour taking it off his hands.
He's probably up to his neck in hock for it.
I don't know.
If you don't get me that coat I'm gonna have a migraine till 1970.
Believe me, I don't feel bad.
As a matter of fact, I feel great.
- I finally beat Charlie at something.
- You said you lost by 12 strokes.
- Eleven!
- Oh, pardon me.
But we flipped a coin to see who would tip the caddie, I won.
- It cost me 10 bucks, but I won.
- I love you, you nut.
I love Oh, come in.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
I just wanted to tell you that you have got another Arnie Palmer here.
- He made a shot - I told her.
What can we do for you?
Well, we've known each other for a number of years, right, Dar?
- Lf it's about the job - No, it isn't.
- Shall I excuse myself?
- No, I want you to stay right here.
You are a very important part of this.
Dar, my wife wants to buy your wife's mink coat.
She's been bugging me since she saw it.
She's gonna make my life miserable for me.
Well, I don't get it, Charlie.
What's the joke?
- She wants to buy my mink?
- That's impossible.
I know you're touchy on the subject, Dar, but Why should I be touchy?
Sam doesn't own a mink.
- Now I don't get it.
- Darrin, could I talk to you?
- When?
- Now?
- Should I leave?
- No.
It'll only take a minute.
Excuse us, Charlie.
Sam, what's this all about?
Well Oh, Darrin.
Well, you see, Daphne said some very unkind things about you and about how you were doing.
Well, so I just zapped up a mink coat and said it was a present from you.
That's great.
- I'm sorry.
- We'll talk after we get rid of him.
I hope you kids have settled on a price.
- The coat's not for sale.
- We're making progress.
At least he said that there is a coat.
- Would you consider $5000?
- Absolutely not.
Oh, I understand.
Sentimental value and all.
Let's say 6000 then.
Charlie, you can't put a price on sentiment.
Now, I know the coat was custom made from pelts of identical twins, so What?
Identical mink twins?
So how about $8500?
Will you cut that out?
You haven't seen the coat!
It might have a hole in the pocket!
Dar, Daphne wants it.
That's all I have to know.
Come on, kids, be realistic.
You certainly can't turn down 12,500.
The answer's no, Charlie.
No.
Samantha, talk to him.
Tell him you don't really even like the coat.
Well, Darrin, what was I to do?
Daphne was being so patronizing.
She practically called you a loser.
So to prove what a winner I was, you gave yourself a mink coat.
Well, I'm sorry, darling.
But She could have said anything in the world about me but I didn't want her to knock you, don't you understand?
Perfectly.
I'm enough of a breadwinner to provide necessities.
When it comes to luxuries I wanna give you I can't compete with witchcraft!
I can't give you anything you can't zap up yourself.
Oh, Darrin, please let me explain.
Explain what?
I think everything's all too clear.
Well.
- Hors d'oeuvre?
- No, thank you.
Would you care to dance, Daphne?
Senator, I know how you loathe vetoes, but I have a crushing migraine.
So sorry.
Hey, Darrin, what's wrong?
You seem upset.
Have I done anything to offend you?
No, Charlie.
You just helped put things in perspective for me.
- Daphne, can I see you for a moment?
- Certainly.
You haven't by any chance changed your mind, have you?
Daphne, the coat is yours.
Oh, you don't mean it.
- Charlie!
- Please, just between you and me.
- Charlie!
Darrin!
- Daphne.
Oh, it's beautiful.
What's going on?
Don't be too long.
She might change her mind.
Charlie will give you a check, Samantha.
Well, Daphne, you don't understand.
I'm giving it to you.
Giving it to me?
Yes.
Charlie told me how much you admired it, and I want you to have it.
Well, that is a marvellous coat, Samantha.
This is worth a great deal of money.
You can't.
Oh, no, Samantha, you can't give away anything this valuable.
Oh, yes, you can, Daphne.
When you value something else a great deal more.
More than this?
Oh, you're kidding.
No, I'm not.
I don't think I've ever been as serious or meant anything as much in my life.
Oh, Sam.
I'll get it, sweetheart.
- Mrs. Stephens?
This is for you.
- Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
Who is it, honey?
Oh, it's a package, and by special messenger, no less.
Hey.
I haven't forgotten a birthday or an anniversary, have I?
Of course not.
I wouldn't let you.
Well, who's it from?
It's from Daphne and Charlie Harper.
"Dear Samantha, I'm returning the coat.
It would take volumes to explain why, but I have a feeling I don't need to make an explanation.
I'm certain you'll understand.
Please accept my thanks for giving me a sense of value.
Daphne".
Oh, there's a P.S. From Charlie.
"Thanks for giving me a new Daphne.
Charlie".
Hey, did we do all that?
You did, sweetheart.
Honey, about this coat Are you sure you don't wanna keep the coat?
Oh, sweetheart, I can zap up mink coats all day long.
But I can never zap up another Darrin Stephens.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
Morning, Samantha.
Has Darrin left?
He left at 5:00 this morning.
Driving up to Bridgeport to take care of that account for you.
Why?
I was hoping to catch him before he left.
It's that new client, Mr. Morgan, our prize headache.
Oh, yes.
I've heard about him.
Darrin hasn't told you all about him.
He doesn't use that language.
Well, he told me what kind of a tyrant he is.
Tyrant is putting it mildly.
He's still living in the Victorian Age.
The louder you talked, the righter you were.
He wasn't due until tomorrow but he checked in at the hotel this morning.
No, no, no, no, don't bother.
As long as Darrin's already gone l'll just handle him solo.
Thanks anyway, Sam.
Oh, you're welcome, Larry.
Bye-bye.
Well, what was all that about?
Darrin's firm has a new client that's been giving them trouble.
Seems he's some sort of a tyrant.
Acts as though he's still living in the Victorian Age.
Oh, now, don't you say anything against the Victorian Age.
I loved it.
Those were the days.
Did you know I was once lady in waiting to Queen Victoria?
Really?
I didn't know that.
No, you and your mother were in Tibet at the time.
I just had an urge to rub elbows with royalty.
And the more I think of it, the more I like the idea.
What idea?
To go back to the Victorian Age.
Well, now, Aunt Clara, do you really think that's wise?
Unless you're absolutely sure you know the right spell.
I wouldn't want you to end up in the wrong century.
Now, don't you worry about me.
Oh, I still have a lot on the ball.
Now, watch.
Eye of newt Leg of spider Queen Victoria Tallyho I cast my spell And off I go Your Majesty.
You're not Queen Victoria.
I'm sorry about that, Aunt Clara, but I'm just as glad you didn't go.
Wouldn't want you to get lost or anything.
We don't know where we are but we are not amused.
You said you were her lady in waiting.
Well, what does a lady in waiting do?
When the bell rings, you run like crazy.
Your Majesty.
I'm Clara.
Your lady in waiting.
Clara?
We don't recall the name, but the face is vaguely familiar.
Your Majesty always said I was the vaguest person you had ever known.
Clara.
We Clara, your limbs are showing.
Oh, yes.
Well, they are sticking out, aren't they, madam?
You wouldn't dare set foot out of the palace like that.
- Yet you have the audacity - Your Majesty We do not speak until we are spoken to.
Well, I'm sorry, Your Majesty.
Who are you?
Well, I'm the niece of your lady in waiting.
Niece?
You look more like a nephew.
Where?
Where are we?
Have I been spoken to?
You have been spoken to.
Well, speak up, Samantha.
I forgot the question.
Clara we know where we are.
We want to find out if you know where you are.
Well, I'm in New York, Your Majesty.
The United States of America?
- Yes.
- President McKinley!
Where?
We must make preparations for President McKinley to call.
If you'll excuse me for a moment, Your Majesty.
- Young lady!
- Yes?
We never turn our back upon our queen.
Well, I beg your pardon, Your Majesty.
I was just going outside to get the morning paper so I could show Her Majesty that she is in the 20th century.
Mr. Morgan.
Good to see you again.
If I'd known you were coming earlier If you'd known you'd know as much about my business as I do.
Yes.
But Mr. Stephens is in charge of your account, and he won't be back I'm the one who's in charge of my account.
The trouble with you is that you don't have any initiative.
I pay you to work out a campaign, then I have to do all the work myself.
- What's this?
- The layouts that Mr. Stephens has been working on.
Now, if you'll notice the way we worked the trade name in Don't talk when I'm thinking.
And don't turn your back on me.
Pay attention.
I am paying attention, Mr. Morgan.
I asked you not to talk while I'm trying to think.
Mr. Morgan, I'm sure you're not paying us all this money to remain silent.
I've helped Mr. Stephens on this campaign and The blind leading the blind.
Mr. Morgan, I hope you know We're talking again.
I can't help it.
I can't remain silent.
Mr. Morgan, we're trying very hard to modernize Now, now, we're not angry with you.
It's just I'm always hoping that someday I'll find someone who can do something without my assistance.
It's the same in my factory.
There isn't a man in it who can do anything without my assistance.
When did you say this Stephens will be back?
I talked to his wife earlier, and she said I'd like to meet his wife.
I judge a man by the wife he selects.
If she'd like to have us for cocktails I drink martinis.
As the northern states shivered in a near-record cold wave Californians flock ed to the beaches in temperatures in the high 80s.
Oh, Aunt Clara, isn't it marvellous how she's adjusted to the 20th century?
Yes.
She always said that royalty could not indulge in the luxury of surprise.
Surfing conditions were excellent, and the warm weather produced more than its share of bikini-clad sun worshippers showing off the latest fashions.
Has neither one of you the decency to faint?
Come, Clara.
We are not amused.
- Larry?
- Hi, Samantha.
Hi.
I didn't expect you.
Well, it's one of those unexpected days.
Here's your paper.
You came all the way out from the city just to bring my paper?
- Samantha, I have a favour to ask.
- Couldn't you have phoned?
I was afraid you'd say no.
This way I can get down on my knees.
- What is it?
- It's Mr. Morgan.
Oh, the terrible tiger.
Could you invite him to cocktails?
I realize it's a terrible imposition - Darrin isn't here.
Couldn't you?
- But he wants to meet you.
Me?
He judges men by their wives.
Larry, well, if there's anything I could do to help, I'd What's that?
And what happened to your television set?
This way, Your Majesty.
What the?
We do not speak until we are spoken to.
Her Majesty expresses her appreciation your bringing her the evening paper.
An aunt of mine.
Thinks she's Queen Victoria.
I knew you had one peculiar aunt, but Two.
They try to outdo each other.
Sort of friendly competition.
Samantha.
Mr. Morgan's account runs well over a million dollars.
Would it be asking too much of you to keep the royalty out of sight while Mr. Morgan is here?
Oh, yes, Larry.
I understand.
Good.
Well, then I'll see you at 5 with Mr. Morgan for cocktails.
- Good, Larry.
Bye-bye.
- Bye.
Good news.
I hope so.
She likes your bedroom.
Oh, that's nice.
And more good news.
She feels the same about the 20th century as I do.
Now we're gonna get some action.
I hope not.
Oh, Clara, the world is in a terrible state of affairs.
Oh, it is in a mess.
Indians massacre Chicago!
Oh, no, no, Your Majesty.
That's the baseball page.
Baseball?
Yes.
It's a game.
I'm very vague about it but I think it has something to do with eating hot dogs.
Oh, well.
What are we, Victoria Regina Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland Empress of India What are we doing in the 20th century?
Providence obviously desires our assistance in straightening things out.
We accept the divine right of kings as a divine responsibility and duty.
Clara, fetch us pen and paper.
We shall begin by issuing some decrees.
Oh, another martini, Mr. Morgan?
Why, thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
My husband is looking forward to working with you.
He should be.
He'll have the benefit of all my years of experience.
Her Majesty would like some tea.
Majesty?
Our daughter is like a princess.
We call her "Your Majesty".
Oh, very charming.
Would you excuse me for a moment?
Aunt Clara.
Aunt Clara, whatever you do, don't let her come downstairs.
Oh, no one tells her what to do.
She has a mind of her own.
Aunt Clara, you just have to send her back.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We are going to straighten out the 20th century.
She has the brains, I have the magic.
But I must be very discreet because she mustn't know that I'm a witch.
Clara, we will start with the Western Hemisphere.
Oh, yes, dear.
- You saw her?
- What was she?
She's my Aunt Harriet.
She thinks she's Queen Victoria.
Well.
Well, if If you could just ignore her.
Ignore her?
Why, I admire her.
She's my kind of woman.
I say, if you have to go out of your mind, go out in a big way!
Here she is.
Will you be kind enough to present me to Her Majesty?
Your Majesty, may I present Mr. Morgan?
You may rise, Mr. Morgan.
We were impressed with you the moment we saw you.
You hear that?
You remind us of Mr. Gladstone.
No kidding?
I've always reminded myself of a big shot like Gladstone.
You know, cracking the whip over Parliament.
We detest Mr. Gladstone.
That's what I call a real regal attitude.
Not afraid to speak out.
I'm that way myself.
L Why don't you two run along and let me have a private little chat with Her Majesty.
Well, I don't think that You're arguing with me, Tate.
Sorry.
Off with you.
Off, off, off, off.
Now, let's you and I have a VIP conversation.
You tell me how you run your empire l'll tell you how I run my mattress factory.
Sir, have you forgotten yourself?
Oh, not a chance.
I never forget me, or anything else.
I have a memory like a steel trap.
We have not given you permission to seat yourself.
Oh, come on, come on.
Sit down.
Let's talk empires.
Even Mr. Gladstone has greater respect for the Crown.
Now, take it easy, Your Majesty.
Let's keep this on a basis of friendly equality.
Equality?
You're the commonest commoner I've ever encountered.
No gentleman would seat himself before a lady let alone the queen of England.
Well?
I'm trying to go along with you.
I'm trying to be friendly with you.
But don't push me too far!
You will kindly show proper respect for the Crown.
I told you to cut that out.
That is better.
You shall remain on your feet.
- Enough is enough!
- I'll say it is, Mr. Morgan.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
May I escort you upstairs?
Perhaps you'd like a little nap.
You keep out of this, Tate.
I can handle this nut.
We are not amused.
Excuse me, Your Majesty.
But this self-appointed emperor of a mattress factory has it coming to him.
We haven't given anyone permission to speak.
- Oh, shut up!
- Don't you tell anyone in this house to shut up.
This is Darrin Stephens' house.
He's the one who says shut up.
May I speak for your husband?
Oh, be Be Be my guest.
Shut up.
How do you like that?
I finally got up enough nerve to do it.
Your Majesty, we humbly apologize.
We shall retire to our bedchamber.
If we decide to forgive, we shall notify you.
Larry, I'm very proud the way you stood up to him but it's a million-dollar account, don't you?
Songwriters are missing the greatest hit in the world.
You know, they should put music to those words: "Shut up".
- Samantha?
- Yes?
Do you have someplace I could lie down?
- Would you like an ice pack?
- No, thanks.
I just want to lie down.
Guest room's at the top of the stairs.
All the time I was telling him off, I was wondering why I wasn't the least bit worried.
Now I know.
The time hadn't come yet.
Now I'm worried.
You are falling asleep.
You are falling asleep.
Deeper and deeper asleep.
You are dreaming that you are Queen Victoria.
You run your factory just lik e Queen Victoria ran her empire.
Oh, we certainly do.
If anybody gets out of line, we let them have it with our fan.
You ring your little bell, and everybody jumps.
You're fired!
You sit on your throne and tell everybody how to do everything.
We are not amused with your advertising campaign.
But you are not Queen Victoria, you're only a petty little tyrant.
And as you think back in history you know how tyrants came to their end.
- Larry.
- What is it?
It's Mr. Morgan.
He's back.
Morgan?
Oh, let me think.
Let me think.
Let me think of a good apology.
I can be the most apologetic person in the world when I put my heart into it.
- May I come in?
- Yes, of course.
I won't stay a moment.
Is Mr. Tate still here?
- Mr. Morgan.
- Well, Tate I just came by to tell you of the most wonderful dream I had.
I dreamed I was Queen Victoria.
Isn't that fantastic?
It suddenly dawned on me that you were telling the truth.
I have been running my business like a tyrant treating people as though I were the queen mother, the queen bee.
- That's absolute nonsense - You're talking while I'm talking.
Sorry.
Nobody else has ever dared tell me to my face.
I admire you, Tate.
You're the kind of man I want to handle my account.
- And I'll keep my nose out of it.
- Oh, no, no, Mr. Morgan You're talking again.
Sorry.
Well, that's all I came by to say.
I'll see Stephens when he gets back.
Good.
- Goodbye.
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Night-night, Mr. Morgan.
Nighty-night.
Well, how about that?
Yes, how about that.
Now, if I can make it to my car I think I'll go home and have a double.
- Nighty-night.
- Nighty-night.
Her Majesty will be down in a moment.
Oh, really, Aunt Clara.
Darrin is going to be home soon, and she cannot be here!
Now, please, send her back.
I've forgotten the spell.
Well, you leave me no alternative.
I may not be able to send her back, but I can certainly get her down here.
How did we get here?
We didn't come down the stairs and we don't recall jumping.
We came here like this, Your Majesty.
I am a witch.
We do not approve of such things.
Sorcery and witchcraft are forbidden.
Clara, you are her aunt.
You're not a witch?
Well, we can't all be perfect, Your Majesty.
I do seem to recall my beloved Albert Even Albert liked you.
If we had known this in the 19th century we would have had you flogged.
Our memory may be bad but when we get mad, we remember our spells.
Eye of a newt Leg of a spider Queen Victoria Tallyho I cast my spell And off you go Oh, Aunt Clara, now we've got Prince Albert.
Maybe I didn't use enough English on it.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Well, I'm meeting Darrin for lunch about 1:00 so if you got here about noon, it'd be perfect.
Okay?
Bye-bye.
Who was that, honey?
The sitter?
- Who'd you get?
- My mother.
Since when do you talk to her on the phone?
I wasn't on the phone.
Honey, about lunch.
I've been wondering is it wise to go to La Bella Donna?
The service is slow.
Oh, sweetheart.
The whole point is that's where we had lunch on our first date three years ago.
If the service had been faster, we might never have married.
That's true.
Unless, of course, you haven't got the time.
Well, I do have a very heavy afternoon.
But I've only got one appointment this morning: The Warbell Dress account.
Warbell?
You said he was one of your toughest clients.
He is, but I'm meeting with his daughter Terry.
She's been made advertising manager.
Just call me if you have a problem.
It's wonderful you remembered.
Most men don't remember their wedding anniversary.
They would if they were married to you.
Because you are unforgettable.
What did I ever do to deserve you?
That's what I've been asking ever since you married.
Endora, this day is so special that not even you are going to spoil it.
- Goodbye, sweetheart.
- Goodbye, darling.
Goodbye, Endora, dear.
I may be violently ill.
Mother?
You know very well you catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.
Tell that to the Dodger outfield.
Hi.
Aren't you Darrin Stephens?
- Yes, I am.
I don't believe - No, we haven't met.
But we're supposed to in about Oh, how do you do?
- Isn't this a coincidence?
- It certainly is.
I thought your folks lived in Larchmont.
They do, but since I'll be working with McMann & Tate I got an apartment not far from here.
Well, how about that?
I better hurry.
I'll be late for our meeting.
I have an idea.
Why don't you ride with me and we can talk on the way?
That's very sweet of you, but I'll be needing my car later on today.
That's an even better idea.
I'll go along with you.
But You see, the sooner we get started, the earlier we'll finish.
Okay.
There, that's a human being for you.
One minute he's so sweet you have to go on a sugar-free diet.
And then he goes out and picks up the first gorgeous face he sees.
Mother, he was just giving her a lift.
From what I can see, vice versa.
Any woman whose husband remembers the date of their first meeting has nothing to worry about.
I'm glad you feel that way, darling.
- I do.
- Good.
Do you really think she was that gorgeous?
Though I understand Warbell's interest in a magazine like Knick erbock er's my study shows that on a cost-per-thousand basis we could do much better in some of the mass-circulation magazines.
- How do you feel?
- Just wonderful.
I mean about the mass-circulation magazines.
- The what?
- Miss Warbell - Terry.
- Terry, l I think you have something on your mind.
I do.
I was wondering where we were going for lunch.
Lunch.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's impossible.
I have a very important lunch date.
Oh, and you can't break it?
Even for me?
- I just couldn't.
- Well, Darrin how are you getting along with the loveliest manager ever to grace these offices?
- Fine, fine.
- Everything okay?
I think he's absolutely marvellous, even if he won't take me to lunch.
Well, most of our clients feel that Darrin Won't take you to lunch?
It's just that I have a very important engagement I can't break.
Darrin, you must be sick or you wouldn't even dream of turning down this lovely young lady even if she weren't the daughter of our oldest and biggest account.
Sorry, it's just one of those things.
See you a minute, old man?
Certainly.
Excuse me.
Be right back.
What do you mean, you can't break your lunch date?
Who's it with?
- Samantha.
- Your wife?
You're putting me on.
Larry, it's a very important lunch.
What's so important about lunch with your wife?
Well, it's the anniversary of our first meeting.
Big deal.
Bring her a box of candy.
- Larry, I promised.
- So what?
Now, take it from an older and wiser hand.
It won't be the last promise you break.
You read me?
- Larry - Darrin, my boy, remember this: At McMann & Tate, no sacrifice is too great.
You lucky son of a gun.
Get on the horn and tell Sam the lunch is off.
We've been through this before.
There's no sense threatening me.
Well, let's put it this way: You take Miss Warbell to lunch or you're fired.
Now I read you.
How do I look?
- Too good for him.
- Oh, Mother.
In just a little while, Darrin and I will be reliving one of our most romantic moments.
Can't you try to be a little happy for us?
All right.
But it's very difficult to change the habit of a lifetime, dear.
Excuse me.
Hello.
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Samantha, something's come up.
I'm afraid I won't be able to make lunch.
Oh, sweetheart.
Business, huh?
- What else?
- Oh, I don't know.
I thought maybe Miss Warbell had swept you off your feet.
- Is that who you're having lunch with?
- That's right.
Exactly.
We haven't finished our business, see.
I see.
Is she as pretty as that girl I saw getting in the car this morning?
They're practically identical, if you know what I mean.
You mean that's Miss Warbell?
- That's right.
- How'd she know where you live?
I'll explain that to you tonight if I can.
Well, all right, sweetheart.
Bye-bye.
Well, what's the story?
- Darrin's taking a client to lunch.
- You mean that girl he drove off with?
Oh, Mother, it's business, pure and simple.
Oh, don't talk to me about being pure.
I saw that girl, and I'd like to know what kind of business.
- Really.
- You're my daughter.
If that mortal means so much to you, and I can't imagine why but if he does, you've got to do something.
- Like what?
- Lf I were you, I'd pop into that office and I'd find out what was going on.
Well, you're not me.
You handle things your way, and I'll handle things mine.
That's a good idea.
Oh, Mother, that's not what I meant!
We should be back about 2:00.
Where would you like to have lunch?
Anywhere you say.
You still have a reservation at La Bella Donna, if you'd like that.
Well, the service there is awfully slow.
Sounds perfect.
That's where I'd like to go.
Well, Betty, then we'll be back in an hour and a half or two hours.
Yes, Mr. Stephens.
Oh, Miss Warbell, I'm dying to ask you a question.
- What is it?
- Will boots be popular next year?
I'd say that all depends on how Boots behaves herself this year.
- Well, shall we go?
I'm starved.
- Yes.
I don't want to leave without my notes.
I hate to rush you through lunch, but I have a lot of notes to go through Oh, excuse me a minute.
Oh, there you are, Miss Warbell.
I'm Miss Krovistrod.
I write the fashion copy for Tate & McMann.
I've seen your picture a million times.
I just want to get a little advance on what you're planning for next season.
Are we through with those long skirts the girls have been wearing?
I do hope so.
They're so dreary, don't you agree?
Why, yes.
Yes, I do.
Then we can look forward to hemlines being raised next season?
Oh, definitely.
I think if a girl has something, she should show it.
Now, I would like your opinion about the new polyester fabrics.
Or don't you care for her designs?
I think Polly Esther is as good as the next designer.
Oh, I'm glad you feel that way.
Thanks much.
This time I'm gonna keep these in my hand.
- Abner!
Aren't you ever gonna get up?
- What for?
- I wanna talk to you.
- Talk.
Well, how can you listen when you're asleep?
Same way I listen when I'm awake.
Yes.
Yes!
I don't know.
L I beg your pardon?
I seem to I don't know.
I think I'm lost.
Oh, well, don't let it bother you.
People your age often forget.
But I'm only 24.
What?
Abner!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Abner, there's an old hag at the door, and she says she's only 24!
I told you sooner or later your mother would flip.
Can you imagine a fashion expert not knowing about miniskirts or boots or synthetic fabrics?
Well, she was probably being funny.
Don't you think?
No, phoney.
I tell you, that woman's a fake.
Mother, that's ridiculous.
I can't understand you, Samantha.
Your husband is with who knows what kind of impostor and you refuse to become alarmed.
That's right.
Because Darrin would never do anything to hurt me.
He's good and kind.
Then how is it that he took that woman to your favourite restaurant?
You're making that up.
I tell you, I heard him say he'd be at La Bella Donna.
Now, do you call that good and kind?
Yes.
Good for nothing, and kind of a rat.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
I have a visitor here and I have a feeling that she's your kind of people.
What do you mean by that?
Yes.
Yes?
Yes.
Well, hold on just a moment.
- Mother!
- Yes, darling?
- Are you expecting anyone?
- No.
Why?
It's Mrs. Kravitz.
There's a woman at her house, apparently a very, very old woman who claims she's only 24 years old.
Some women never give up hope.
- What's her name?
- What's her name?
- Do you know your name?
- Of course.
Terry Warbell.
Terry Warbell!
I knew it.
I knew there was something wrong with that woman.
- Well, what is it?
What's going on?
- I'll explain later.
Right now you better pop in next door, get that woman over here before Mrs. Loudmouth finds out anything more.
- Hello, are you there, Mrs. Stephens?
- No, I'm here.
How could you?
L Abner!
Abner!
Abner, this you gotta see!
I was talking to her on the telephone and she pops in here!
- Who?
- Who else?
Mrs. Stephens.
Look!
You'll say anything to get me up, won't you?
Now, just calm yourself and try to recall what happened.
It was this morning.
I was driving along in my car.
I saw this old woman.
She waved at me, and I stopped.
And then, I don't know how it happened but I was the old woman and she was driving off in my car.
The only thing I can remember is my age and my name.
Oh, there's no doubt about it.
There's no doubt about it.
She's the Crone of Cawdor.
- The Crone of Cawdor?
- Yes.
That does sound familiar.
Well, it should.
When you were a little girl it was one of your favourite bedtime stories.
Of course.
She was turned into a hag and had to live all alone on a mountain peak in Carpathia.
That's right.
And do you remember the rest of it?
Well, let's see.
When the earth turns once Around the sun Let the crone go forth Till the day is done.
Another's form she'll tak e And her form leave From 6 in the morn Till 6 in the eve.
And in this guise, if she can secure A willing kiss from a mortal pure To her will pass the mortal's youth To him will pass her age, forsooth.
Oh, no.
Darrin!
Oh, yes.
And if he kisses her, he'll be 500 years older.
But no wiser.
What's the matter, darling?
I thought you trusted your husband implicitly.
Well, of course I trust him.
But not with a 500-year-old crone.
Especially not with a 500-year-old crone who's gorgeous and wants to be kissed.
Hello, Larry?
Do you happen to know where Darrin is?
I'm trying to find him.
Why, he's with one of our clients.
And I believe he said he was going to their apartment to finish their meeting.
You mean he isn't with Miss Warbell anymore?
Oh, he told you about her?
Larry, whose apartment has he gone to?
Sam, you have nothing to worry about.
Darrin is as steady as a rock.
Miss Warbell just wants to show him some of her advertising budgets.
Will you please just give me her address?
Sam, I know you won't believe this, but it's the honest truth.
He hung up before I could get it.
Hello?
Sam, are you all right?
Oh, yes.
Yes, Larry, I'm fine.
Oh, Mother, what am I going to do?
If I don't get to Darrin in time, he'll be 500 years old.
Oh, you know they say there are certain advantages to being married to an older man.
Stop being frightful and think of something.
Oh, calm down, Samantha.
Right now we have to find out where this reptile in women's clothes lives and hope to get there in time to keep Durwood kissless.
Wouldn't you be more comfortable here?
I think I can concentrate better standing up.
I can concentrate better if you're sitting down.
Okay.
Can't we stop talking business for a moment?
Well, I would like to go over these details.
We've been meeting all day and you haven't told me a thing about yourself.
If we're going to be working together, there are things I'd like to know.
Now, tell me about yourself.
Well, what would you like to know?
What do you do for fun?
Oh, sports: Swimming, fishing, mountain climbing.
Mountain climbing.
That's very good.
Oh, you have the most fascinating eyes.
Well, I was born with a slight cast in the left.
I had corrective surgery.
Isn't there something you'd like to do?
Yes!
I'd like to finish going over these notes.
"And there is a possibility that the Warbell Dress Company may be interested in some tax-loss purchases.
And toward that end, I would appreciate your giving us complete details on sale price of your holdings as well as a" What?
What happened to Miss Kornblut?
It was time for her coffee break, Mr. Warbell.
And she couldn't wait to finish a letter?
I tell you, nothing's the same since the union came in.
While we're stopped, could you please give me Terry's address?
- I seem to have misplaced it.
- 35 Rollins Place.
- Now can we go on?
- Yes, sir.
"As well as a certified copy of all of your company's debts including those owed to the government for corporation taxes".
- You got that?
- Got what?
Why don't you people drink coffee for a living and take work breaks?
Now, here's our big gun.
Warbell is an odd name.
You almost want to say "warbler".
Well, why not take advantage of it?
Now, what we had in mind was a new dress.
We could call it the Warbell Warbler.
Now, when we introduce the dress, all the stores will take out full-page ads.
We'll pick up half of the charges, of course A simple "I don't care for the idea" would have been enough.
What sort of mortal man are you anyway?
Is business the only thing on your mind?
Doesn't it matter to you that you're alone with a beautiful woman?
With a warm, vibrant woman crying out for a little love?
Kiss me.
Terry, it's nothing against you personally it's just that I'm a very happily married man.
I'm not asking you to run away with me, I'm just asking you to kiss me.
- Yeah, but - Just one little kiss, please.
One can't do any harm.
- Oh, are you wrong.
- Sam, what are you doing here?
- Darrin, you better come with me.
- I will not!
I don't know how you found me, but this is insulting!
- Talk about lack of trust!
- I trust you.
It's that That woman I don't trust.
I beg your pardon.
Sam, I think you owe Miss Warbell an apology.
That woman is not Miss Warbell.
Then who is she?
- The what of what?
- The Crone of Cawdor.
That's the most ridiculous story I've ever heard.
Only an insanely jealous woman would make up something like that.
If this is your idea of a joke, it's a bad one!
It's true.
If you kiss her, you'll be 500 years old.
Sam, you come up with some real beauts.
Tell him.
Go ahead.
Tell him what I'm saying is true.
I'll do nothing of the kind.
Pretend she's not here.
It'll teach her a lesson.
It might at that.
I think I will kiss you.
Any wife who spies on her husband deserves not to be disappointed.
- What do you think of that?
- Be my guest.
- What happened?
- It's 6 in the eve.
- What happened?
- The clock struck 6 just as I was about to strike one.
- Will you tell me what happened?
- Over here.
- Sweetheart - I'm sick and tired of having you say I make things up about the Stephens.
So you're gonna take a look at the old hag and you're gonna ask her how old she is.
And when she says she's only 24, we'll see who's making things up.
- Oh, hi.
- Hello.
Hello, Mrs. Stephens.
Excuse me, I just wanna prove something to him.
Take a look.
Now ask her how old she is.
- How old are you?
- Twenty-four.
- Well, what have you got to say now?
- Let's go home.
Is that all?
When we get home, I'll tell you a lot more.
Good night.
It's lucky that they found you and brought you here.
It must be a simple case of amnesia, don't you think?
I guess so.
I'm terribly sorry about missing our appointment.
That's all right.
After a good night's rest, I'm sure you'll be fine.
- And can we meet tomorrow instead?
- Of course.
Good, because I'm dying to hear your ideas.
My father says you're a very bright young man.
Thank you.
I don't know about bright, but my wife helps me stay young.
He means our marriage keeps him young.
Then I'll see you tomorrow about 10?
Okay.
Why don't I walk you out to the car?
- Good night, Miss Warbell.
- Good night, Mrs. Stephens.
Excuse me.
Do you want a word of advice, Samantha?
Not really.
Well, I'm going to give it to you anyway.
That girl is not to be trusted.
You don't mean to say that she's an impostor?
No, she's the real thing.
- Oh, is she real.
- That's why I wouldn't trust her.
Now, if I were you, tomorrow morning l'd make some excuse to pop into that office, and I'd just make sure that Honey, you are the greatest.
Any other wife would've flipped over the treatment you got today.
Well, for future reference, I wasn't too far from flipping.
You pitched in and rustled up this dinner.
And you know something?
This lasagne is every bit as good as La Bella Donna's.
Well, it should be.
I had it sent from La Bella Donna.
More Chianti?
- Courtesy of La Bella Donna?
- Everything is from La Bella Donna.
Oh, except this: Happy anniversary, darling, of our first meeting.
I'll kiss to that.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Marvellous breakfast, beautiful wife.
I think it's going to be a gorgeous day.
I think I'll quit my job and enjoy it all.
Think I'll begin by going back to bed.
Oh, fine, fine.
I'll just have the postman slip our bills under your pillow.
I get the message.
The slave's off and running.
- See you tonight, sweetheart.
- Yes, sweetheart.
Now, listen very carefully, dear, and watch Grandmama.
Oh, witches of the yesteryear Grant me this wish to disappear.
See how simple it is, dear?
It's really very easy, darling.
Now, why don't you try it, huh?
Oh, no, she won't!
When did you swoop in?
We have doorbells, you know.
And I warned you about teaching Tabatha that hocus-pocus!
Oh, don't be such a bore.
We were just playing a little game.
I saw that game.
I've told you a thousand times: Witchcraft will not be practised in this house!
What on earth is going on?
Just Darwin whispering at his usual level.
- I've had it with her!
- All right.
You'll be late for work.
- I'll settle everything.
- Okay, okay.
But just keep that harpy away from my daughter and me!
I'll see you tonight, sweetheart.
He's really too much.
Mother, what was it this time?
Oh, nothing.
He was just being his usual self.
Difficult.
Well, that's utter nonsense.
You provoke him.
He gets along beautifully with everybody but you.
It's true.
In business and everything else people find Darrin extremely likable.
Come on, sweetheart.
Time for your breakfast.
Here we go.
People find dum-dum extremely likable.
Oh, they do, do they?
Well, let's see how likable he can be.
Say, I like this type you've selected, Darrin.
Bold, has authority.
Thanks, Larry.
Yeah?
It's for you, Larry.
Hello.
Oh, yes.
Send him in here.
Frank Eastwood, an assistant from the mayor's office.
He can't want a contribution.
Campaign's over.
Not for us.
I didn't have time to tell you but they want McMann & Tate to create a new image for the mayor.
- Isn't that a little out of our line, Larry?
- Not at all.
It's a very large fee.
Besides, it will open a whole new field for us, so turn on the charm, my boy.
- Hello, Larry.
- Frank, my buddy.
Nice to see you.
I don't believe you know Darrin Stephens.
- Glad to meet you.
- The pleasure's mine.
Have a seat, Frank.
Shall we discuss this over some coffee?
- How do you take yours?
- Cream and sugar, please.
- You take yours black, right, Darrin?
- Right, black.
Oh, tiny wizard of the irascible spell At the teeny sound Of your tinkling bell The new acquaintance This mortal meets He will dislik e And with loathing treat - You don't like cream?
- No.
Why not?
- Why not?
- Why not?
- What have you got against cream?
- I don't have anything against cream.
Gentlemen.
Gentlemen, let's forget about the coffee, shall we and get on with the campaign.
All right.
All right.
This campaign for the mayor has to be handled with the utmost tact and diplomacy.
- I understand, sir.
- How can you understand, Stephens?
I haven't even mentioned the problem yet.
Just be quiet until you know what's going on.
Look, Frank.
Let me assure you we're here to listen and do the best campaign we can.
Oh, I know you are, Larry.
You're an old friend.
- And I trust your judgement completely.
- Good.
Now, just tell us what sort of image for the mayor you would like us to mould.
Well, Mayor Rockland is a fine administrator.
But he lacks colour and appeal.
He's sort of old-fashioned in his dress and speech.
Stephens here is an expert at creating colourful phrases that we can sprinkle liberally into the mayor's speeches.
All right, Stephens.
Let's hear some of those colourful phrases of yours.
Well, I'll have to give that some thought, sir.
Now, that's a cliché if I ever heard one.
The mayor uses that line every day.
I wasn't suggesting he use it.
Why not?
What's wrong with it?
Got him elected.
Yes, it did.
And I voted for him.
Stephens, I resent your toadying attitude.
I didn't come here to seek political patronage.
I thought you might have some ideas about public relations.
Well, I'm sorry.
Perhaps it might be better if you gentlemen discussed this campaign alone.
Oh, you're walking out on us, huh?
Politics are beneath you, is that it?
You're interested in tawdry commercial accounts.
- I don't think Darrin meant - Don't apologize for him, Larry.
But in view of his personality, I don't see how we can possibly put the mayor's image in the hands of this agency.
Frank.
Frank, I'll call you.
Why did you do that?
- Do what?
- Why did you rub him the wrong way?
I didn't, Larry.
You heard him.
He was the one who got out of line.
The client never gets out of line.
For some reason or other, he took an instant dislike to me.
Loathed you, is the way I'd put it.
We can't have that, not in our business.
Mr. Stephens?
Mr. Stephens, there's someone here to see you.
The model Mr. Tate wants interviewed for the Baldwin Blanket account.
- She's here.
- Who?
Is something wrong, Mr. Stephens?
Wrong?
What?
What's wrong about me?
Oh, nothing, sir.
Nothing's wrong with you as far as I'm concerned.
- Would you please send in the model?
- Yes, sir.
- Miss Adams?
- Thank you.
Hello, Mr. Stephens.
I'm Gloria Adams.
- The Summit Model Agency sent me.
- It's nice to meet you, Miss Adams.
Since it's for Baldwin Blankets I thought this costume might be appropriate.
The nightgown's a very good idea, but I don't think it's necessary.
You mean you want to see more of me?
Oh, no.
No.
I just mean you come highly recommended and I'm sure you've had a great deal of experience.
And what do you mean by that crack?
Nothing at all.
I mean you've had a great deal of experience modelling.
Yes, that's very lovely.
I'm sure you'll do nicely.
- Do what?
- Nothing!
- Here.
Let me help you.
- Don't you dare touch me.
Come on, Miss Adams.
I'm a happily married man.
Oh, that is what they all say.
Beast.
L All right, all right.
I believe you.
So you didn't get out of line with her.
The Summit Model Agency did report to me that she was highly incensed.
Incensed?
She's a kook!
Yes?
Send him right in.
I can't understand it.
She acted like I was some kind of bluebeard!
Forget it.
We can always find another model.
But not another account as lucrative as Baldwin Blankets.
Now, for heaven's sake, make a good impression on Baldwin, please.
- Horace!
- I wanted you to see this immediately.
It's just off the loom.
The new Super Electronic Baldwin Special.
Horace, it's a beauty.
Say, you haven't met Darrin Stephens, our top man.
He's got some great promotion ideas.
Happy to make your acquaintance, Darrin.
I've been looking forward to meeting you.
Now, let's get down to business.
Where are those great slogans you brought me?
I put them right on your desk, Larry.
Get off that blanket, boy.
Excuse me, sir.
It's the new Super Electronic Baldwin, not a doormat.
Here they are.
They're your ideas, Darrin.
- I think you better read them, Larry.
- What's the matter?
- Haven't you got any faith in them?
- I certainly have, sir.
I think we can get a campaign that will sell your blankets like hotcakes.
I don't like overconfidence.
What he means is that he has confidence in the excellence of your product.
- Well, why didn't he say so?
- I did say so.
We're going to stress the quality and the durability of the Baldwin Blanket and also the beauty and the comfort.
Sounds like you're using the hard sell, and my blankets are soft.
Oh, well, we intend to use soft humour in the slogans.
Larry.
Like this: "For full protection, Baldwin Blankets keep you covered".
It's scary.
"Protection" will make the customers think about burglars, not sleep.
Burglars.
Well, how about this?
"Make your security blanket a Baldwin".
Make your jokes on your own time, Stephens.
Horace, perhaps we ought to give this campaign some more thought.
I'm sorry, Larry.
He just hasn't got the feel for my blankets.
And chemically, we don't hit it off.
He's some kind of a kook too.
Well, Larry, say something.
That's not rational behaviour.
Speaking of behaviour This is the third time this morning you've provoked hostility in the office.
- Well, it's not me.
- No, it's not.
You're not yourself.
Your personality's taken a swan dive and two accounts have gone down with it.
- I just don't understand it, Larry.
- Neither do I. Why not take the afternoon off and talk to someone who might?
- Like who?
- Like Bob Farnsworth.
The psychiatrist?
Now, just a minute, Larry!
Bob's okay as an occasional golf partner but I don't swing with this head-shrinking jazz.
Don't be medieval, Darrin.
You need psychiatric first aid.
What I need, Max can handle!
- Max?
- He's my favourite bartender.
Even the door hates me.
- Another one, Mr. Stephens?
- No, Max.
Nothing's going to help.
- Nobody likes me.
- Yeah?
How come?
Down, down, down Personality crackup.
Hey, buddy boy, you know what?
I went to Philadelphia yesterday.
Shut up, Harry.
- You sure nobody likes you?
- They loathe me, the whole world.
Hey, pal, you know what?
Yeah, we know.
Yesterday you went to Philadelphia.
And it was closed.
Okay, now beat it.
Don't bother Mr. Stephens.
It's all right, Max.
Let him stay.
I need a friend.
Boy, you are in a bad way.
Washed up.
My boss even tried to send me to a psychiatrist.
You don't need a "psycho-diatrist," buddy boy.
Clam up, Harry.
What do you know about it?
Last year I started going to a psychiatrist about my drinking.
- Are you still going?
- No, I gave him up.
I couldn't afford the booze and him too.
Beat it, Harry.
Who needs you?
You crumb.
You see, Max?
Even him.
Oh, don't pay any attention to that bum.
- Everybody treats me like that.
- Yeah?
Well, there's gotta be a reason.
Maybe your boss was right.
Maybe you got one of them complexes.
- Does it show that much?
- I don't know.
I ain't no skull doctor.
- You think I need one too.
- Well, it can't hurt.
You're right, pal.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Larry.
Darrin?
What would he be doing home at this hour?
Isn't he at the office?
Troubled?
What do you mean, troubled?
Now, don't get upset, Samantha.
It's probably nothing serious.
It's just that he's developed some sort of a personality problem.
- Has anything gone wrong at home?
- No, of course not.
What do you mean, personality problem?
All morning people have been taking an instant dislike to him including one of our most important clients.
- I don't understand.
- I don't understand it either, Sam.
But fortunately, Baldwin said he's reconsidered his attitude toward Darrin.
He's on his way to give him another chance.
Larry, we have to find him.
Where do you think he could've gone?
- Well, he was headed for a bar.
- A bar?
And grill.
I called there, but he had left.
Maybe he took my advice and is with Bob Farnsworth.
- The psychiatrist?
- Yes, the psychiatrist.
I don't want to interrupt the session.
He certainly needs help.
If you hear from him, would you tell him to get back here as soon as he can?
Oh, yes.
Yes, I will, Larry.
Bye.
Psychiatrist?
Darrin?
But everyone likes Darrin.
Everyone except Mother.
Mother, I want to talk to you.
I know your spiteful spells.
You're antagonizing people against Darrin.
You materialize this instant.
Mother, you're putting the mother-in-law business out of business.
Tell me, how long have you had this feeling that people dislike you?
Just since this morning.
I think your inner conflicts have been building up ever since your marriage.
It all starts in the home, you know.
I'm very happily married.
Only on the surface, Darrin.
Deep down, you're seething.
Bob, you've got it all wrong.
Perhaps.
But you're certainly overreacting to my suggestion.
I am not!
I am not.
I love my wife.
All right.
But let's keep an open mind, shall we?
Then if we happen to find any little hidden resentments towards your wife's behaviour, we can bring them out into the open.
I don't resent her.
The whole suggestion is ridiculous.
I don't think so.
It's a typical American male attitude to be fearful of revealing a wife's domination.
- Samantha does not dominate me.
- I didn't say she did.
But you applied my general observation to yourself.
That's because you're getting me all mixed-up.
Now, that's a healthy sign.
I think if we dig a little deeper into your ego, your marriage we can cure your problem.
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.
Nothing's wrong, not with you.
You seem to be a very fine person.
Calm, well-adjusted, one of the nicest men I've ever met.
I'm the hostile personality around here.
I'm the one who should be seeing a psychiatrist.
- Where are you going?
- To my psychiatrist.
And if you think I'm expensive, you should have to go to him.
- Sam, what are you doing here?
- Don't worry.
I got Aunt Hagatha to sit with Tabatha.
- How did you know I was here?
- Never mind that now.
- Larry needs you back at the office.
- I can't go back there.
- I'll just cause more trouble.
- Oh, Darrin.
It isn't you.
It's Mother.
Yes, you see, she put some kind of spell on people so they dislike you.
I should have known this was Endora's sandbag.
I'm afraid so.
You'd better get to the office.
Mr. Baldwin's coming to see you.
What good will that do?
Baldwin will have Endora's whammy on him.
I'll find her and get her to take it off.
But meanwhile, you be very, very, very nice to him.
Be sweet as pie.
Now, hurry up.
Well, Darrin will be very pleased that your attitude toward him has changed.
Well, here he is now.
Mr. Baldwin!
I can't tell you how marvellous it is to have the pleasure of your company again.
- Well, thanks.
- It's so very, very, very nice of you to come back again.
Yes, sirree, sir.
Certainly pleased, all right, isn't he?
Well, Stephens I felt that I was a little hasty and abrupt in my judgement of you and your ideas this morning.
Oh, not at all, sir.
It was entirely my fault.
You were right, sir.
I should have paid more attention to your ideas.
Oh, excuse me, is that lint on your suit, sir?
Oh, that's a beautiful suit, sir.
May I compliment you on your taste?
I guess so.
Well, as I was about to say What was I gonna say?
That you liked Stephens' ideas for Baldwin Blankets.
Yes.
Yes!
I particularly like the slogan that goes: "For full protection, Baldwin Blankets keep you covered".
Are you absolutely certain you like it, Mr. Baldwin?
I'll do anything to make it better.
I'm sure that I can improve it.
- No, I like it just the way it is.
- Are you positive, sir?
- After all, here at McMann & Tate - Yes, Darrin.
He's positive.
Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. Baldwin.
Won't you have a cigar, sir?
- They're the finest.
You'll enjoy it.
- No, thanks.
Don't smoke cigars.
That's very wise of you, sir.
Can I do anything else for you?
- I'd just like to get on with it.
- Good idea, Horace.
You're tired.
Why don't you sit down?
This chair is very comfortable.
I don't wanna sit down.
I want to get this over with and go to lunch.
You're hungry.
I'll run right downstairs and get you a sandwich.
Darrin.
What would you like, sir?
Ham, corned beef?
How about a club?
Club?
Don't tempt me.
I'd be only too happy to get it for you, sir.
Since you agree with the way we're going to handle this campaign, let's get together some other time so you won't be late for your luncheon appointment.
Larry, a great suggestion.
The account's yours.
- Oh, thank you, Horace.
- Go ahead without me.
Mr. Baldwin, I'll be looking forward to our next meeting.
- At your convenience, of course, sir.
- I like your work, Stephens.
But I don't think we'll need any more meetings.
Well, we got the account back again, but you almost lost it.
I was only trying to be likable.
I liked you better when you were unlikable.
Samantha!
Sam!
Hi, sweetheart.
Is something the matter?
- This time your mother's gone too far.
- What did she do now?
She took the spell off, that's what!
Well, since when is that something to complain about?
When she takes the spell off, I don't know it's off and I make a fool of myself in front of Larry and Mr. Baldwin that's when I complain.
I tried to call, but your secretary said you were busy and couldn't be disturbed.
I was busy getting myself nominated as the boob of the year.
But only after I'd won the vote as the most disliked boob of the year.
I don't have to worry about my popularity.
Well, I should hope not.
Well, not with everything else you have to worry about.
What "everything else"?
Well, like your charm, your good looks your wonderful personality, your funny, crooked smile your great sense of humour, your warmth and sincerity.
Gee, I didn't know my smile was crooked.
- Darrin.
- What?
I'm telling you I love you.
And I love you.
Crooked how?
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye, sweetheart.
- Bye-bye.
Be a good girl.
Other kids leave toys lying around.
In my house, they're flying around.
Sam!
- Sam!
- Yes?
Sam, you've gotta do something about Tabatha flying her toys around the house.
I'm sorry, sweetheart.
Every time I catch her, I tell her no.
But it's hard to break a child of doing something that comes naturally.
Honey, it's not me I'm worried about, but what about my parents?
What about my mother?
What if Tabatha twitches her nose and Peter Rabbit here flies into her lap?
That will be a little hard to explain.
To say the very least.
Look, from the time my parents get here until the time they leave I hereby give you permission to fight witchcraft with witchcraft.
I think I better get that in writing.
I mean it, honey.
It's the only way.
Okay.
But remember, it was your idea.
Sam, I said after my folks get here.
Sorry, sweetheart.
I was just practicing.
I'd better hurry.
- I'll try to get home early to help out.
- Okay.
Good luck, sweetheart.
Bye, Tabatha.
Daddy.
Sam.
Sam!
- I thought you just left.
- So did I. What am I doing here when I was just standing on the front porch?
I don't know.
I certainly didn't do it.
Daddy.
Endora.
Tabatha, no.
You mustn't do that.
Tabatha?
- How could she?
- I'm afraid it's wishcraft.
Wishcraft?
W-l-S-H craft.
She's going through a new stage.
When she wishes for someone to be with her they automatically are.
Wishcraft.
Darling, I know it's gonna be difficult.
You really ought to be proud of her, though.
Most children don't go through this stage until later.
I must say she's got a great sense of timing.
Just when my folks are coming.
Sam, it's tough enough having a baby daughter who's a witch You sneak out.
I'll try and distract her.
Does she have to be a precocious witch in the bargain?
Darrin.
Go out the door.
Where's your bunny rabbit, sweetheart?
- Yes, there it is.
There's your - Rabbit.
Yeah, there's your bunny rabbit.
Rabbit.
All right now, Tabatha.
During the time that Grandma and Grandpa are visiting no more of that, huh?
Okay.
That is definitely a no-no.
Oh, no.
Oh, Tabatha.
You can't have started that already.
And how's my little darling today?
- Mother, it was you.
- Oh, now, don't lecture me, Samantha.
I'm merely exercising my right to see my own little granddaughter.
Well, I'm not angry.
As a matter of fact, I'm delighted to see you.
You are?
How refreshing.
Could you stay for a while?
I may need your help.
Darrin's parents are in town, and they're coming over.
Oh, my poor Samantha.
Having to put up with Darwin is bad enough, but his parents?
Mother, please?
If I ever needed another witch in the house, it's today.
Of course, dear.
Besides, Mr. Stephens isn't half bad.
Mother, you will be nice to Mrs. Stephens.
She's sort of sensitive.
Will you please?
Well, all right.
I'll stay.
- Oh, Mr. And Mrs. Stephens.
- Samantha, darling.
How very nice to see you.
- How's my favourite daughter-in-law?
- Oh, just fine.
Oh, Samantha, dear.
You look a little pale.
Are you feeling all right?
Nonsense, Phyllis.
She looks terrific.
Thank you.
You remember my mother.
- Oh, certainly.
- Mrs. Stephens.
Do you live here now?
Live here?
Whatever gave you that idea?
Well, it's just that the last time we were here, you were here.
- Yes.
- And, well here you are again.
It seems that every time we visit Darrin and Samantha, you're here.
It's quite a coincidence.
- It's a wonderful coincidence.
- Oh, Mr. Stephens how well you look.
It's been a long time, hasn't it?
You're looking as handsome as ever.
Well.
Why are we all standing here?
Let's go in and have some tea.
Did you have lunch?
On the plane.
It was very greasy.
L I made some of those little sweet rolls from the recipe you gave me.
You really must taste one and let me know how I've done.
Shall we be comfortable, Mr. Stephens?
Your recipes have been such a tremendous success.
Please sit down.
Frank, I left my hanky in my coat pocket.
- Would you get it for me?
- Oh, sure.
Where's Tabatha?
I can't wait to see how she's grown.
Well, I just put her down for her nap, but she should be up shortly.
I think you'll be surprised at the change in her.
- Here, dear.
- Thank you.
- I get such a head cold whenever I fly.
- Oh, really?
- I never do.
- Me neither.
But Phyllis here, she could write a book: Aches and Pains for Every Occasion.
I'll I'll get the tea.
Mother, will you help?
- Oh, certainly, darling.
- I'd be glad to help, Samantha.
No, Mrs. Stephens.
You sit right down and relax.
You do look a little peaked.
Phyllis, you might make a little effort to get along with Samantha's mother.
What for, dear?
You seem to be making effort enough for both of us.
I'll get it, Samantha.
Hello?
Oh, Darrin, it's Mother.
Oh, it's wonderful to hear your voice too.
Do you have a sore throat?
No, mother, I'm fine, really.
How was your trip?
Oh, it was all right.
Samantha's mother greeted us at the door.
- Does she visit very often?
- Phyllis.
Endora?
What's she doing there?
I'm sure I don't know, dear.
But it does seem strange that every time we come to visit, she's here too.
You know, in-laws can cause such a terrible problem if If they intrude too much.
Let me talk to Sam, Mother.
All right, dear.
It's Darrin, Samantha.
- Thank you.
- Say hello to him for me, will you?
Sure.
Hi, sweetheart.
Your father says hello.
What's your mother doing there?
Haven't we got enough problems?
Oh, yes, yes.
They both look wonderful.
Travelling obviously agrees with them.
By the way, Mother dropped in a little while ago.
Isn't that nice?
Sam, I want her out of the house immediately.
If there's one thing we don't need, it's another witch!
Well, sweetheart, that's exactly what we do need.
I'm coming home right away, and I want her out!
Really?
Oh, that's wonderful.
Then you'll be able to come home early.
They're so anxious to see you.
Oh, yes.
They're both standing right here.
Hang on a minute, sweetheart.
Would you pour, Mrs. Stephens?
I'll be there.
Of course, dear.
Come, Frank.
Darrin.
Mother is trying to help, which is more than I can say for you at Do you take cream or lemon, dear?
Lemon, please, Mrs. Stephens.
You were saying, sweetheart?
I was saying I'm coming home.
I want your mother out of the house.
I'll wait till you're off the phone, dear, so your tea won't get cold.
In the meantime, I'll go upstairs to look at Tabatha.
- Mother.
- Yes, dear?
Mother, Mrs. Stephens would like to see Tabatha.
Would you show her the nursery?
- I know where the nursery is.
- I'll go with you.
In case she's up we wouldn't want her to be startled by an unfamiliar face, now would we?
What's going on?
What did I hear?
Has something happened already?
Darrin, we'll discuss it when you get home.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
- When's Darrin coming home?
- He said It's all right.
You can tell me.
I know what these family squabbles are.
What squabble?
Are you and Darrin having a fight?
- Why, no, l - I suppose Dagwood was being boorish and insensitive again.
- His name is Darrin.
- Named after his grandfather.
And I resent you calling him insensitive.
I heard the tone Samantha used to him on the phone.
- Now, really - Knowing Durwood, I would say that she kept her temper admirably.
His name is Darvin.
I mean, Darrin.
What's the difference?
What dreadful thing did he say to you, dear?
He didn't say Whatever it was, I'm sure it was justified.
- Oh, now, Mrs. Stephens - You ought to know.
You were eavesdropping on the whole conversation.
Since you and my son obviously don't get along wouldn't it be a better idea if you left before he gets home?
I am not accustomed to be told to leave my own daughter's house.
I'll be right back, Frank.
I don't think that Sam and Darrin were having a fight.
Oh, what do you know?
I tell you, they're in serious trouble and that woman is at the heart of it.
Oh, Mother.
You were supposed to be a help.
Now look what's happened, even before Tabatha's awake.
This is awful.
He made you cry.
That brute has made you cry.
It's not Darrin.
And I'm not crying.
Maybe not on the outside, but on the inside, the tears are flowing.
- Mother, I wish - I can see that my presence is no longer required.
Good.
Make my daughter cry, will you?
For every tear my daughter has shed may buckets of water fall on your head.
Endora.
Mr. Stephens Mr. Stephens, you're being rained on.
The roof is leaking.
I can't very well work in an office where the roof is leaking.
I think I'll take the afternoon off.
But it's not raining outside.
It's raining inside, on you.
Sudden cloudburst.
You probably just didn't notice it.
Don't worry, though, I already called the roofing-repair people.
They should be right over.
Well, goodbye.
Thank you.
So you see, Mrs. Stephens, it's all been a misunderstanding.
There's nothing wrong between Darrin and me.
That's what I told you.
You've just been imagining again.
I know what I heard, Frank.
It's all right, Samantha.
You don't have to cover up.
Married people have squabbles all the time.
I'll say.
But there's nothing to cover up, Mrs. Stephens.
Darrin and I are as happy as a couple of clams.
And when he comes in, you'll see.
Well, if I imagined it, so did your mother.
She was certainly under the impression you were having a fight.
By the way, where is your mother?
She had an engagement.
But she told me to tell you how very, very nice it was to see you again.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I think I'll make some more tea.
Now, don't you feel a little foolish?
Not in the least.
I don't believe a word she said.
Darrin.
Darrin, you're being rained on.
Mother!
Mother.
At your beck and call, darling.
There he is.
Doesn't he look all fresh and dewy?
Just turn it off.
All right.
Mother, why?
He made you cry.
Oh, my goodness.
Endora, this is absolutely the last time - Daddy.
Yes, sweetheart.
This is Daddy.
What are you trying to do?
I didn't do a thing.
Tabatha.
He must be in the nursery.
- Samantha, is that Darrin?
- Mother, quickly.
Toodle-oo.
Samantha, didn't I just hear Darrin's voice?
Darrin?
No.
He always uses the front door.
That's funny.
I could have sworn That is Tabatha's voice.
She must be up.
I'll go see.
That's peculiar.
I know I heard Darrin's voice, but I didn't hear Tabatha's voice.
Sam, what's going on?
Your parents think you haven't come in yet.
Well, if you're talking about the way normal people go in and out, I haven't.
- She also thinks we've had a fight.
- We have.
No, I mean a big fight.
You have to go back outside and make an entrance to show your mother everything's all right.
I'm not sure that it is.
Is your mother gone?
Yes.
Darrin, please.
How can I make an entrance when my daughter won't let me go 10 feet away?
Darrin, is that you?
In the closet.
Quick.
Samantha, I'm sure I just heard Darrin's voice.
Isn't he here?
Here?
Oh, Mrs. Stephens, you must be imagining it.
Since we arrived, people have been telling me I've been imagining things.
I know I heard Darrin's voice.
Tabatha, look who's here.
Grandmother Stephens.
What do you think of her?
Oh, my, she has grown.
Do you remember me, darling?
- Daddy.
- No, no!
You mustn't do that.
What did the child do?
Well, she didn't finish her nap.
You know how important it is for children to get their sleep.
She heard something in that closet, and so did I. I'm beginning to feel like a yo-yo.
A soaking wet yo-yo.
I'll be right down, Mrs. Stephens.
I'll be there.
Sam, this is ridiculous.
Oh, I know, sweetheart, and I'm very sorry.
It's been a nightmare ever since your parents arrived.
We'll be out of it soon, darling.
Pop me outside, and I'll make an entrance that'll make Romeo and Juliet look like cool acquaintances.
You really are drenched.
Better let me zap you into some dry clothes.
Never mind.
There's been enough zapping going on around here today.
As soon as you're ready, I'll have to pop you outside.
No Yeah, I guess you better.
Okay, hurry up.
Must be like kissing a minnow.
- Maybe that's Darrin.
- Does he usually ring the bell at his own door?
- Mother, go away.
- I finished early, so I thought l'd drop by to see how things were going.
Oh, you're still here, I see.
I'm awfully glad you could come back.
- Thank you.
- Yes, I'm glad you came back too because I have something to say that I want you to hear.
By all means.
I wouldn't miss this for the world.
Frank and I think that Samantha and Darrin are having difficulties because you've been intruding too much on their lives.
You think so too, Frank?
It doesn't matter what he thinks.
I'm speaking for Darrin.
That's nice, because he often has difficulty speaking for himself.
You see, that's exactly what I mean.
You're constantly criticizing my son to Samantha.
Durwood needs no criticism from me.
What's wrong with him is for the whole world to see.
There is nothing wrong with my son.
But if Samantha has allowed you to influence her then I would say the trouble is with her.
Samantha, dear, this discussion is for your benefit.
I really think you should pay attention.
Sam, where are There you are.
Oh, sweetheart.
- I missed you.
You look gorgeous.
- Thank you.
- Is that a new dress?
- I've had it for months.
Well, you make it look new.
Mom, Pop.
It's good to see you.
Doesn't she look terrific?
Great.
You look fine too, Darrin.
Thanks, Pop.
Mom, you look younger every time I see you.
Endora, sweetheart.
So nice of you to drop in while the folks are here.
This has all the earmarks of a put-up job.
You see, everything's just fine.
Your mother had some cockeyed notion that things weren't going so well between you and Sam.
Darrin, are you sure?
I told you it was all your imagination.
Mrs. Stephens, I have an excellent idea.
Why don't you go upstairs and bring Tabatha down?
She's napped enough.
- Sam.
- Oh, I'd love to.
Mother, dear.
I'm not imagining things.
They're both trying to cover up.
I know what I saw.
Do you know what you're doing?
She doesn't believe me.
I'm gonna have to convince her that you can't always believe what you think you see.
Mother, would you care to join me in a little tactical witchcraft?
With pleasure.
Come to grandmother, sweetie.
I'm having one of my sick headaches.
There.
That ought to do it.
Shall we join the gentlemen?
What a shame.
I was having such fun.
I'll take the tea things out, and then start dinner.
- How about a drink, pop?
- Good idea.
- I'd love one.
- Not for me.
Samantha, Darrin.
I want to apologize to you both.
You were right.
My imagination's been playing tricks on me.
But I'm delighted it was me instead of a real battle between you two.
Don't give it another thought, Mrs. Stephens.
She must be tired after her long journey.
Poor dear.
- Daddy.
- It's all right, honey.
Daddy's right here.
She really loves her daddy, doesn't she?
Oh, she certainly does.
Samantha, the dinner was absolutely delicious.
You're a marvellous cook.
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
I'm so glad you liked it.
And Endora, I must compliment you too.
I'm sure you taught Samantha most of what she knows.
Well, I try, but she doesn't like my methods.
Oh, Mother.
Really?
Now, isn't that the way with children?
But you and I must swap recipes.
I have one for a perfectly divine sponge cake.
Pop, your fork.
You dropped your fork.
- Did you see that?
- What?
That apple.
It floated right over to her.
Oh, Frank, for heaven's sake.
What a silly thing to say.
Now you're imagining things.
Yeah, maybe I am, but I could have sworn that Oh, she just loves apples.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
All right, Tabatha.
Lesson number one in oven cleaning.
Fascinating, huh?
I knew it.
I knew it.
I knew that life with that mortal would finally get to you.
You're taking gas.
With an electric stove?
That would be the trick of the week.
My poor Samantha.
Where is your pride?
Do you realize you're doing that menial work right before the eyes of your child?
You bet.
I figure she can't learn too young.
Well, actually, darling, I came to invite you to the elephant races at New Delhi.
Honey?
Not on an empty stomach.
Good.
- So long, hon.
- Have a nice day.
Haven't you heard?
Today is going to turn the tide.
These layouts I've been working on are going to knock the client's eyes out.
I'm not going to be too tough on Larry but I think the bonus I get should cover the trip to Bermuda we might take.
Might take?
Well, if the prospective client becomes "unprospective" Sweetheart, he'll love it.
I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What do you mean by that?
- Nothing.
Just wifely encouragement.
- Then keep it that way, huh?
- What?
- Of course.
- See you tonight.
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye-bye.
If you leave it to mere wifely encouragement the closest you'll get to Bermuda will be an onion.
Oh, very funny.
You should be in Paris or London or going to the elephant races with me.
But since he can't afford it I think he needs help.
Mother, dear, butt out.
Samantha, it is your heritage, you know.
You should live in the sparkle of a star in a flash of colour.
Samantha, you're a creature of the wind.
Mother, speaking of wind, why don't you blow?
Samantha!
Oh, my!
Oh, Mother, please!
Speaking of ill winds!
This one is a real beauty!
If Wilkerson likes this as much as I think he will it could mean a lot more than one lipstick account.
We might even lock up all the Madame Marushka products.
Lipstick, face cream, hair spray, all that gook!
Lt'd be worth millions to us.
Millions.
You know your eyes light up when you talk about money, Larry?
Of course.
I'm a greedy person.
- Yes?
- Mr. Wilk erson is waiting.
Be right there!
Withershins and darklings chuckle One man will shine, One man will sparkle Stephens will seem to you the best A better man than all the rest No offence, Darrin, but I think I'd better carry the ball.
Arch Wilkerson's an old golf buddy and I'll be able to handle him with just the right touch.
- That's fine with me, Larry.
- Good boy.
Watch me have old Arch eating right out of my hand.
Hey, Arch, have I got a winner for you!
It's sweeter than holing out a 60-foot approach shot.
Yes, I'm sure it is, Larry.
You must be Stephens.
- It's a great pleasure to meet you.
- I'm delighted to meet you, sir.
Well, let's get on it.
Believe me, it's a hole in one, all the way!
Yes, of course, Larry.
What do you think of it, Stephens?
We believe in the campaign we have for Madame Marushka's new lipstick.
You give us the word, we'll get the ball rolling.
Very good, Stephens.
I like the way you put that.
- Why, thank you, sir.
- I said that exact same thing to you.
Don't you remember?
Yesterday at the clubhouse.
Yes, of course.
You've got my curiosity going.
Let's see those layouts.
You'll flip, Arch.
When you and I discussed this last week, I decided Yes, yes.
I think I should tell you, Stephens that this lipstick is the key product for our whole new line.
Madame Marushka herself will be very interested in how you handle it.
Well, I'm sure if she'll drop by the office, we'll be able to What?
Drop by the office!
Did you hear that, Arch?
Stephens doesn't know what we know about Madame Marushka.
Never makes personal calls, a recluse in her ivory tower.
I remember you telling me on the fairway Larry, why don't you sit down.
We're not out on the golf course now.
Please go on, Mr. Stephens.
- Well, l - You've got the ball, kid.
Tee off.
As we saw the problem, it was to introduce a new product in a new area.
I'm sure if you study these, sir, you'll get the idea.
Ah!
Yeah.
And then Mr. Wilkerson insisted that I be put in charge of Madame Marushka's account.
Which means, dear girl, if you care to plan ahead you may start packing for Bermuda immediately.
Oh, Darrin, that's wonderful!
I'm so proud of you.
I can't wait to tell Mother.
- Why?
- Why?
Why?
So she can hear the good news.
Sam, the last thing your mother wants to hear is good news about me.
Why are you so anxious to tell her?
What has she got to do with this?
Nothing.
Besides, at a time like this, we're certainly not going to let anything that Mother might say or do bother us, are we?
What do you mean?
"Might do or say".
Did she do something?
What did she do?
It has to be something underhanded, right?
Right!
Darrin, you keep asking and answering your own questions.
I save a lot of time that way.
She did do something, but what?
You wanna answer that one?
No.
Figures it had something to do with work.
This morning.
Wilkerson.
Was that the result of some of her hocus-pocus?
Bingo!
Well, Darrin, I don't really know.
All Mother said was Sure.
That's why he took such a shine to me and practically ignored his old pal Larry!
She put a spell on him!
Darrin, give yourself credit.
Wilkerson liked you because he liked your ideas.
Mother had nothing to do with that.
I thought Larry was overdoing his golf buddy bit.
But that was Endora's doing!
- You're jumping to conclusions.
- Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.
But as long as there's a possibility of that possibility it ruins the whole deal for me.
Really, Samantha!
You picked a lemon in the garden of love.
Mother, you did influence Darrin's client!
- Naturally.
But I did it for you, darling.
- Oh, for!
If I hadn't, Mr. Wilkerson wouldn't have given him the time of day.
You should be celebrating.
In my house we celebrate the things I earn, and I didn't earn anything!
Mother, you had no right to meddle.
Darrin can get ahead strictly on his own.
Fat chance.
I can handle this, Sam.
Endora, you wasted your time.
You threw the Madame Marushka account into my lap.
I'm throwing it right back out again.
I'm taking myself off the account.
Do you think that once the wheels are in motion, they can be stopped?
You bet your sweet broom I do!
Don't be too sure about that.
Just don't be too sure.
After all, Larry, you brought Wilkerson into the office!
He's your friend, and I think it's only fair that you personally handle the Marushka Cosmetics account.
Fair, schmair.
Look at me, Darrin.
- Is this the face of a sensitive man?
- But, Larry Wilkerson wants you.
I want that Marushka account.
So, what's the problem?
- What about your pride?
- My what?
Wilkerson likes you better than me, so I'll cry all the way to the bank.
Mr. Stephens!
She's here!
She is?
Who's "she," Betty?
- Madame Marushka.
- Unbelievable!
And she wants to see you personally, Mr. Stephens.
That's great.
That's great.
Show her in.
Show her in!
Madame Marushka never leaves her salon, but she's coming to see you.
She must have flipped over your ideas!
It's fantastic.
It certainly is unbelievable.
Gentlemen.
This outfit is from my spring collection.
Tell me how you love it.
I adore it!
- I think it is quite mad.
- Quite mad.
"Marushka".
That is how you say my name.
Marushka.
You try.
- Marushka.
- Marushka.
- Fair.
But you will learn.
- We'll practice.
As you know, I do not usually attend business discussions.
So dull.
But my Mr. Wilkerson he was so impressed.
- Tell me.
Which one is Steffins?
- He is, Marushka.
Marushka.
- Darrin Steffins.
- Stephens.
Stephens, my assistant.
And I'm Larry Tate.
We're glad you came over.
We can't wait to get moving Ah.
That is why I have come to you.
If this dear man is to work for my firm then he must have a very responsible position in your firm.
A partner, I should think.
Yes!
A partner.
You want Mr. Tate to make me a partner?
You want me to make him a partner?
It is my policy never to do business with a man whose name it is not part of the name of the company.
- Are you suggesting?
- Precisely!
"McMann, Tate & Steffins".
- Stephens.
- Madame Marushka - Marushka!
- Madame Marushka.
I hardly think I never entrust a new campaign to an employee.
No, no, no.
I want someone with the authority to make decisions.
I insist upon that, Mr. Tate.
Then it is settled, no?
- No!
- Steffins!
I'm sure we can work something out.
Just a minute!
If I'm to be a partner, that should be Mr. Tate's decision.
He shouldn't be forced into it.
I'd resign before I'd allow that to happen.
Ah, now I understand you.
If you had had the drive it would have been McMann, Tate & Steffins a long time ago!
I know your type.
You are afraid of success.
Afraid of success?
You know my type?
That's right, Steffins!
Stephens!
Durwood Darrin Stephens!
And I'll thank you to use my correct name!
Durwood is getting no apologies from me.
Oh, Mother, please stay until Darrin gets home and then sort of bury the hatchet.
I'd love to.
Where?
- How dare you!
- You heard me, you phoney!
Get out.
Darrin, have you flipped your wig?
Larry, I know what I'm doing!
This is not Madame Marushka!
She's a fake!
Now, get out!
Are you Madame Marushka?
The account, Darrin!
You just blew a million-dollar account.
- Larry, we haven't lost a thing.
- You must be kidding!
She was a complete fake.
Darrin, are you sure?
How do you know?
I can't tell you, but believe me, I know.
But how?
Just a minute.
She was a spy.
You know how unscrupulous agencies try to steal accounts.
- That's what was happening here.
- A spy?
I'm gonna take the rest of the afternoon off.
I have something important to take care of.
Sure, sure.
She was a spy.
She was?
Sure, she was.
Was she?
Samantha!
Samantha!
What's wrong, sweetheart?
Wouldn't Larry let you off the account?
I didn't get a chance to argue the point with him.
Something a little more important came up.
- Like what?
- Like her nibs!
Are you referring to me?
I'm not referring to Marushka!
Samantha can you translate that gibberish, or am I to be left in the dark?
Don't try to brazen it out.
She came to my office today and tried to pass herself off as Madame Marushka!
I saw through her little disguise and tossed her out on her ear.
- How'd you like them apples, Endora?
- You're sick.
Sweetheart, Mother wasn't in your office.
She was with me all morning.
Sure, she was!
Come on, Sam, don't alibi for her.
That's no alibi.
She was here all the time.
When, all the time?
This morning, all the time.
Your mother was really here with you?
Yes, Darrin.
She really was.
You've never lied to me, have you, Sam?
No, sweetheart.
Not even this one time.
Darrin, Mother was here with me all morning.
I could forgive a little lie this one time.
Hello.
Oh, hi, Larry.
But Madame Marushka.
I threw Madame Marushka out, along with a million-dollar account.
So why shouldn't I be fired?
- Darrin - I certainly can't allow you to lose that precious little job.
And I won't sit and watch you take the bread out of my granddaughter's tiny mouth.
- Now, one simple incantation - No!
Well, it is my fault, in a way.
No!
No witchcraft, nothing.
I'll handle this my way.
If I fall on my head, well, I fall on my head.
But you stay out of my life!
Darrin, can't I do something?
No!
No!
I'm sure she'll see me.
I don't have an appointment but I've got to see Madame Marushka, it's a matter of life or death.
Mine!
Maybe I can catch her between calls.
All right, you can wait.
But no promises.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Marushka think that there is no more to say!
Madame Marushka, please let me explain.
Forget it, Stephens.
She's not having any.
Larry.
Mr. Steffins, I am so glad that you are here also.
Now I can be rid of both of you at the same instant!
You have every right to be angry.
I can't explain my actions but I am sorry, and I humbly apologize.
I do not accept your apology!
Well, then don't!
But you're a businesswoman.
At least take a look at the layouts.
If you don't like them, I'll leave without being told.
But don't dismiss my company just because I made a little mistake.
Very well, Mr. Steffins.
I won't have it said that Madame Marushka made a business decision based on personal reactions.
"Don't play fair.
Use Madame Marushka's lipstick".
- Isn't that something?
- I hate it!
Goodbye, peasants!
Nothing personal, Darrin, but I think I'll have you shot.
Oh, Larry, please!
Let's talk.
Let me buy you a drink.
All right, Stephens.
One drink.
But don't talk to me.
I'm liable to lose control.
It was all sewed up.
You had to get that crazy idea Madame Marushka was a fake.
The whole sweet deal Larry, for the last two hours you've been going on and on and on.
- Why did you do it, Darrin?
- Why did I do it?
The whole schmeer.
Why?
- I can't tell you.
- You can tell me.
- No, I can't.
- You can tell me.
I thought my mother-in-law turned into Madame Marushka to foul me up.
So I threw her out.
- Can't tell me, huh?
- Right.
Look at that.
Isn't that a great layout?
- Best thing I ever did.
- Yeah.
Great.
- Bartender!
- Yes, sir?
- May I?
- Hey, that's my paper.
That's my layout!
Somebody stole it, line for line!
Let's go to the office and check the newspaper listings.
- We'll find out who did this.
- We'll find out, and he's gonna pay!
- Give me my paper.
- We'll fix that dirty crook!
Darrin, you're that dirty crook!
I didn't do it.
I don't remember signing these authorizations.
I don't remember typing them, Mr. Stephens, but there they are!
Authorizations for newspapers, posters, leaflets, billboards.
- Billboards too?
- You authorized this agency to pay for all that, and we don't even have the account?
Do you know how much this is going to cost us?
Do you?
Stephens!
Come back here!
Stephens!
Darrin, please try to understand.
Witchcraft got you into this mess, and witchcraft can get you out.
Sam, it's no use.
I'm going to spend the night at the club.
- You don't belong to a club.
- I'll join one.
Darrin, now, listen.
I placed your ads.
Your ads!
They were wonderful.
Madame Marushka was wrong, and you were right.
Sam, I know you meant well.
You always mean well!
I'm almost used to your mother's meddling.
After all, she's supposed to be a colossal pain.
She's a mother-in-law!
But when you start doing it, well, that's just too much.
It is just too, too much.
- Darrin - Goodbye, Sam.
You son of a gun!
You old son of a gun!
You're wearing two coats.
You wanna tell me how much I cost the company.
Don't worry about it.
You'll get every penny back!
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Will you listen to him, Sam?
The guts of a riverboat gambler and he's worried about a few measly thousand.
Larry, what happened?
What happened?
You wheeler-dealer.
Put Madame Marushka's ads out, even though we didn't have a contract.
And it paid off.
- It paid off?
- Mr. Innocent, eh?
An hour after those ads hit, every chain store in town was calling Madame Marushka, doubling their lipstick orders.
"Don't play fair.
Use Madame Marushka's lipstick".
It's sheer genius!
- The ads worked.
- Worked?
I'm on my way to her salon right now with the contracts for her complete line.
And you did it, fella.
You really did it.
Two coats, huh?
Maybe I'll try that.
The ads worked.
She signed up the entire line.
It was your ads that did it.
I just placed them.
Any office boy could've done that.
Sam, it was still witchcraft.
You did it.
I could've been that office boy if I'd had as much faith in my work as you did.
It doesn't matter.
Even if I should've done it, you did it, and you shouldn't have done it.
Even if I should've done it.
That doesn't make any sense.
I know it doesn't.
I just want you to forgive me, and I don't know how to ask.
You don't have to ask.
That's what I call success.
I'm beat.
Good night, sweetheart.
Good night, sweetheart.
Oh, darn.
It's going to be chilly, and I left Tabatha's comforter downstairs.
Oh, hold it.
Don't run up and down the stairs.
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.
That's very nice of you.
Well, I'm not going to do it.
You know: Why, Darrin, I'm shocked!
You said In this case I'll make an exception.
At least until I can afford an upstairs maid.
Thank you.
All done.
My turn.
Darrin, how did you do that?
I pulled the plug.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
Oh, you still here?
I think so.
Although around here, you can never be sure.
Yes, I'm still here.
I mean, aren't you gonna be late for the office?
Just because Larry's away you're gonna take advantage of it?
- Can you think of a better time?
I don't have anything important on my schedule until tomorrow.
Hey, what was that?
If I am not mistaken, it is not a "what".
It's a "who".
Oh, boy.
Step down.
How very Are you all right?
- Yes, oh, how nice of you to drop in.
- Yes.
Aunt Clara, if you wanna come in through the front door, I won't object.
We don't care where you land.
Here, let me take your bag and your brolly.
- Come around here.
Sit down.
- Here, Aunt Clara.
You're welcome any time.
You want some coffee?
Oh, yeah, well, thank you.
Now, thank you.
Safe and sound.
- Oh, dear.
- Would you like part of the paper?
Oh, no, you keep that yourself, and I'll just zap up one for myself.
Oh, dear.
Now, let's see.
Bubbling, bubbling potion Secret rhyme Send me the morning Herald Times Isn't today Friday?
We're going to have to have a little talk.
I simply cannot Yes, it is.
- Oh, look, this is tomorrow's paper.
- Fine.
- But just let me finish - I just want to find the sports section, you know.
Darrin's just trying to tell you, darling, that Since when have you been interested in sports?
If this is tomorrow's newspaper then it will have today's racing results.
So I'm going to pick a horse and put something on its tail.
That's "nose".
- Let me see.
- Sam!
Well Isn't Larry Tate your boss?
Yes, but that doesn't have anything to What about him?
- It says he broke his leg.
- What?
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.
There it is right there.
"Larry Tate, president of McMann and Tate breaks leg".
- No, no.
Oh, dear.
I'd send a get-well card.
But this is tomorrow's newspaper, and it hasn't happened yet.
This weekend of all weekends.
He and Louise were going on their second honeymoon.
- Honeymoons are such fun.
Especially when you have someone with you.
- Sam?
- Yes.
- Well, what?
- Sam, we've got to get to Larry.
We can't.
They made sure that no one would know where they were going.
So what?
You can find him.
- How?
- You know.
- Are you suggesting that I use witch - Yes, I am.
My boss and one of my best friends is about to break his leg!
We can prevent it!
You gonna?
Oh, hold it.
Hold it.
"We" can prevent it?
Yeah.
You can zap us to where they are and we can prevent Larry from breaking his leg.
- Yes to part one, but I'm doubtful about part two.
Darrin, it's dangerous fooling around with the future.
We'll just have to take the risk.
We're wasting time.
Let's start twitching!
"Us"?
We're partners, huh?
- Sam.
- All right, all right.
Aunt Clara?
Yes?
Dear, Darrin and I have to go out.
Would you babysit until we get back?
Well, of course, dear, yes.
Thank you.
Well, here we go.
Here, now hang on, hang on.
You ready?
Okay.
- Darrin, are you sure?
- Yes!
All right.
Eyes that see all Gentle winds Tak e us to where our search begins Oh, I wish I could do that.
Now let me see.
How does it go again?
Eyes that see all Gentle winds Tak e me to where my search begins Well, you can't win them all, you know.
What did I tell you?
Isn't this the greatest?
- It's wonderful.
- The best part of it is not a single solitary soul knows where we are.
- Everything all right, Mr. Tate?
- Perfect.
- You run a great place, Mr. Murray.
- You're very kind.
I've got to stop hitting that brandy after dinner.
You know, you've really got marvellous legs, Louise.
We've gotta find a way to show them more often.
Oh, you are the most charming liar I've ever known.
Darrin, do you really have the heart to intrude on a scene like that?
We better intrude, and fast.
What better way to break a leg than on a badminton court?
- How will you explain our being here?
- I'm not.
I'm gonna put them on the defensive.
Come on.
Larry?
Louise?
- Darrin!
- Samantha!
- Okay, who told you we were here?
- What?
- You blabbed.
- Oh, no, no, no.
L Tell the truth, Louise.
She told you, right?
Oh, no.
I had no idea It's okay.
If you're here, you're here.
You want privacy as much as we do, so you respect ours we'll respect yours.
Right, Sam?
- What?
Oh, right.
Well, we'll see you around.
Or rather, we won't see you around.
Now, wait a minute.
What are you doing up here?
- I'm here on business, in a way.
- What kind of business?
Larry, you came up here to relax and enjoy yourself.
Here you are worrying about the office.
Forget about the office.
He's right.
Come on, let's go play badminton.
- Okay.
- Wait.
That's no way to relax and enjoy yourself.
It's so physical.
You'll get all tensed up.
Now look, Darrin!
It's their vacation.
Why don't we let them enjoy it the way they want.
Thank you.
Come on, Louise.
- Sam, let's change and get out there.
- Into what?
We didn't bring anything.
Since when has that been a problem for us?
- Us?
- Come on, Sam.
Zap it up, zap it up.
No more bloody marys at breakfast either.
Good shot, dear.
Your serve.
Hi.
Oh, I'm sorry, honey.
Weren't you ready?
I told you this was a dangerous game.
Well, don't let us disturb you.
We're not gonna stay.
Good.
You ready?
You could have fallen over this bench.
You keep this up and you'll end up in the hospital.
- So will you, if you don't leave us alo - Larry, this is too much for me.
- Why don't we go over by the pool.
- Okay by me.
See you.
Darrin, can't you see how irritated he is?
He'd feel a lot worse with a broken leg.
Ever occur to you that a broken leg might not take as long to fix as a broken friendship?
- It's got to be done, Sam.
Come on.
- Where?
- To the pool.
Where else?
If you ask me, I think Darrin's flipped.
- Well, he is acting a little unusual.
- More unusual than usual?
Let's pretend we don't see them.
Go on over there.
He can't get into any trouble like that.
Why don't we just leave him alone?
Sam, you never know.
You just never know.
Larry!
Honey, that was marvellous.
- Larry, that was great.
- Watch it.
- Oh, a sunburn?
- No, just burned.
- I didn't know you were a gymnast.
- Neither did I. Well, where are you kids going to go now?
I don't know.
How about you kids?
I asked you first.
Larry, I feel a little done in.
Why don't we just go to our room and relax?
By ourselves.
That's a good idea.
Do you hear that?
It's okay with Samantha.
I hope you people don't feel we're deserting you.
Oh, no.
I'm thrilled.
Now I hope you're not going to suggest we follow them to their room.
- Well - What could happen to him in there?
Sam, 80 percent of all accidents happen indoors.
Miracle of miracles, they're not following us.
Quick, the skateboard.
Get rid of it.
Yet.
There, you see?
If we weren't here, he would have taken a header.
If we weren't here, he'd be looking where he was going.
Come on.
I hate to admit it, but you're right about Darrin.
He is awfully thick-skinned.
And he's got a skull to match.
Wait, Larry.
This is our first real honeymoon, you know.
Yeah, I'd almost forgotten.
So?
So you're supposed to carry me over the threshold.
Lovey, prepare to be swept off your feet.
Darrin, this is ridiculous.
I am not going to stand here and peep.
- Why?
There's no law that says - There certainly is.
And I'm just not.
"Here we are, alone at last," to coin a Oh, no!
Of all the colossal Look out for the coffee table!
Are you crazy?
The coffee table.
You were about to crash into it.
Hi, Louise.
A little fast teamwork, and we avoided an accident.
Darrin, would you do me a favour?
Get off my team.
Oh, you scared me out of a year's growth.
Not that I want to grow any more.
I just thought I'd pop in while I had the chance.
How's everything going?
Well, fine.
Just fine.
I'm just warming up a bottle.
- Oh, good.
- And when the baby wakes up from her nap l'm going to warm a bottle for her too.
Fine.
Oh, Aunt Clara, are there any messages?
Oh, yes, yes.
I'm glad you reminded me.
Yes.
Darrin's secretary phoned and said the 2:00 appointment tomorrow has been changed to 3:00 today.
No, now wait a minute No.
No, the three The The The 3:00 appointment today has been changed to the 2:00 and Aunt Clara, didn't you write it down?
- I'm glad you reminded me.
Of course.
- Oh, good.
Yes, I Oh, dear.
I should have used pencil.
Yes.
Oh, I remember.
There were three T's.
- What?
- There were three T's in the message.
Three T's?
"The meeting for tomorrow is for 2 today".
"The meeting for today is at 3 tomorrow" also has three T's in it.
Now don't confuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
- No.
No, definitely, definitely, it was for 2 today.
Oh, and it's 1:00 now!
I better get back to Darrin.
Kiss Tabatha for me.
That's one thing I can do.
Lie down and take a nap, dear.
I'm not spending all this money to sleep.
- Is he still there?
- Like he was nailed to the ground.
I don't see her though.
I wonder if they have a rear entrance to this place, or an escape hatch.
I've gotta get a complete checkup.
I think I will lie down.
The meeting's been changed to 2:00 today?
Are you sure?
Positive.
It has three T's in it.
- What?
- Oh, well, just a little joke.
Anyway, I'm glad.
We've made pests of ourselves long enough.
Shall we go?
Are you kidding?
Larry won't be out of the woods till midnight.
Now l I'm going, but you stay here and keep your eye on Larry.
Don't let him out of your sight.
I'm ready for takeoff.
Oh, and honey, see if you can land me near the water cooler.
I'm thirsty.
Oh, yes, a complete checkup.
And the sooner the better.
Larry?
Samantha's out there alone now.
You don't see Darrin?
Then I have a perfectly terrific idea.
- Larry.
- Yes, Samantha?
I know it looks as if we're intruding on your vacation and, well, I just want you to know I feel terrible about it.
That makes two of us.
Excuse me.
Larry.
I wanted to say that things aren't always what they seem.
And I think you ought to know that you have a very valuable friend in Darrin.
Well, with a friend like that, who needs?
Anything else?
No.
Fine.
Excuse me.
Now what?
I could make myself invisible.
Oh, Samantha, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.
Darrin, I don't know if that meeting's over but you've got to come back.
Thanks, and sorry again about bringing you in from out of town.
That's perfectly okay.
But I am anxious to get back, so if you gentlemen will excuse me l'll be going.
- Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Oh, Stephens You know, when he says he's going, he really goes.
Man, this is the end.
The real end.
The last outpost where a man can be alone.
You know it.
- You!
- Nothing like a good steam, huh?
For your information, I didn't have to come here to get steamed.
Now why don't you and Samantha get lost.
Well, Larry, that's not a very nice thing to say.
You make it sound as though we've been pests.
- Oh, do I?
- Well, have we?
Oh, what's the use?
Well, in that case, let me make up for it.
Dinner tonight's on me.
Champagne, the whole bit.
What do you say?
I've had it up to my eyeballs.
I won't stand for any more.
- I don't blame you, dear.
- We're going to be alone even if it means the end of our friendship.
Dinner here is black tie.
You'd better Yeah, all right.
One black tie coming up.
What I need is a vacation.
In some other hotel.
Well, what are you going to say to them?
I'm simply going to say I'll show you what I'm simply going to say.
Please, dear, be calm.
- Hi there.
- Hello.
I thought we'd get a little head start on dinner.
Darrin, Samantha.
We're not going to have dinner with you.
- Was that calm enough?
- Not that we don't appreciate it but, well, we just can't.
Oh, we understand.
Don't we, Darrin?
Of course we do.
They just don't want us to pick up the check.
In that case, we'll go Dutch.
That's not what I had in mind.
Well, then, if you insist, you pick up the tab.
Darrin, I'm going to make something clear to you or die in the attempt.
We want to be alone.
You do understand.
Right, Louise.
Then we'll have dinner served right here.
Darrin, does a house have to fall on you?
We want to be alone, with each other.
Without you.
This is supposed to be a honeymoon, not a tourist attraction.
Well, we Honeymoon?
You mean second honeymoon, don't you?
No, Samantha.
This is our first.
- But I don't - Because when we started to have one 10 years ago, I broke my leg.
- You - Broke your leg 10 years ago?
- To the day, in fact.
- And that's the reason - Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
- I think I'm thinking it.
- Tomorrow's date, 10 years ago.
- Marvellous.
- I'll have to talk with Aunt Clara.
- Forget about Aunt Clara.
How do we get out of this?
You couldn't freeze them permanently?
- Darrin, don't be ridiculous.
- Well, you got us into this.
Get us out.
I got us into this?
Well, let's not stand here bickering.
Do something.
Well, how about?
- Yes.
Yes, it's the only way.
- Whatever it is, Sam, do it, do it!
- Where'd you send them?
- Back to this morning when they arrived.
- But - Here they come.
- We'd better get lost.
- Come on.
- I just wanna make sure it works.
Oh, it's perfect.
I thought you'd like it.
Well, here we are.
There you go.
Thank you.
- Hey, look at this.
- Oh, Sam, the champagne.
I wonder who sent the champagne.
"For a fun evening.
Samantha and Darrin".
Say, that's very - You told them where we were going.
- I did not.
Well, then how did they know?
What's the difference?
It was sweet of them.
As a matter of fact, I was thinking it might have been kind of fun to have them along.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it might have been.
- Lf that's the way they feel Darrin!
A house does have to fall on you, doesn't it?
- More coffee, sweetheart?
- No, thank you, sweetheart.
I gotta run.
With Larry still on his honeymoon, I've got double duty at the office.
I hope he doesn't remember our being there yesterday.
He might hold it against you for some of the things you did.
What happened to "us"?
Well, anyway, I learned a lesson.
Never fool around with the future.
And I learned one too.
If you want a newspaper, go to the corner store.
- I hope you'll remember that.
- I hope so too.
Bye.
See you tonight, honey.
Oh, Samantha, I wish I had your flair.
What's this?
That is your flare, Aunt Clara.
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
Hey, girlie.
Hey, girlie.
- Yeah, you.
- "Girlie"?
- Come here.
- "Come here"?
Yeah.
Come here.
I wanna talk to you.
Can you believe that?
Come on, lady.
What's with this "snooty cutie" routine?
How much longer you gonna play this game?
Ain't I been trailing you the last couple hours?
I'm getting tired of following you around.
I'm not about to let you alone, so why don't you make it easier on both of us?
A pleasure.
Good.
Oh, wonderful.
Beautiful.
Absolutely great.
Oh, what a relief!
- Relief?
- I couldn't be sure until I saw some witchcraft.
Now there's no doubt.
That's ridiculous.
There's no such thing as witchcraft.
What do you call this, chopped liver?
I haven't the faintest idea what you're talking about.
Lady, please.
I'm desperate.
People who are desperate do not go and call other people "girlie".
- I was resorting to charm.
- That was charm?
You're my last hope.
If you don't help me, I'm nowhere.
So please.
How can I help you?
By just using your natural talent.
What natural talent?
Being a witch.
Oh, don't try to deny it.
- I know that you're a witch.
- What makes you so sure?
Because I'm a frog.
Please, break this terrible spell I'm under.
Remove this curse.
Make my life worth living again.
Turn me back into a frog.
Will you stop following me?
I told you, I can't.
Not unless I know where, when and why someone turned you into a human being.
How do you like this bit?
I'm suffering a fate worse than death and this yo-yo wants me to fill out a questionnaire.
Will you quit fooling around and make with the hocus-pocus!
You really are outrageous.
As a human being, yes.
But as a frog, I'm a sweetheart.
Wouldn't hurt a fly.
Eat one, yes.
But hurt one?
Never.
So you'll make like a nice lady witch and do the allakazam?
- Oh, well, now look.
I'm sorry, Mr - Finglehoff.
Fergus F. Finglehoff.
But you can call me Fergus.
Well, I'm terribly sorry, Fergus, but I couldn't even if I wanted to.
- I can't unhex another witch's hex.
- What do you mean?
Well, only the witch that put you under the spell can turn you back.
What?
Congress passed a law?
All of a sudden witches have got a union?
It's a rib.
You're putting me on.
I mean, you better be, because I don't know who put the spell on me.
Fergus, now, that really is too bad.
I'd love to help if I could, but there's really nothing I could do.
You heard?
Now, don't worry.
Don't worry.
I'm not giving up.
I will, I will.
Will you quit hounding me?
Okay, okay.
Back in the trunk.
All right, sweetheart.
You can play in your room and I'll start your dinner.
- Coming.
- Oh, I'll get it.
Hello?
Yeah, this is 555-2134.
- I think this may be for you.
- "May be" for me!
Boy, you've got your nerve.
How'd you get in here?
Through the door.
How else?
Whom should I say is calling?
- What's a "Darrin"?
- Give me that.
I demand an explanation!
Watch it, fella, or I won't even give her the message.
Fergus, that's my husband.
- Sam?
- Darrin?
Sam!
- Is that you?
- Who was that?
Who was who?
You mean, who answered the phone?
- That "who"?
- Sam, answer me.
- Is this your husband?
- Yes.
How come?
Somebody put a curse on you?
- Sam, who is it?
- Sweetheart, it's sort of involved.
It would take a lot of explanation.
I'd have to go into details which would just take forever.
I'll wait till you get home till I can think of something, and then I'll explain everything.
I demand an explanation now!
Right this minute.
Is it okay with Sam?
You "demand"?
Only if it's okay with you, sweetheart.
Mr. Saunders and Larry just walked in.
You remember I told you about Mr. Saunders, our new client?
Your favourite soup, Saunders' Soup.
Fifty-eight varieties?
Fifty-nine coming up.
They wanna know if it's okay with you.
If what's okay?
She says, "Sure".
I knew she would.
Sure what, Darrin?
Nice mud.
No pool.
Well, just as well.
Chlorine gives me gas.
You're bringing Mr. Saunders here?
And Larry and Louise?
Sweetheart, I think you ought to know that I have a problem here.
So I gathered.
And I'm certainly anxious to find out who it is.
I mean, I'm anxious to hear all about it.
So long, sweetheart.
You're sure it's all right?
She's tickled to death, and so am I. What now?
Mrs. Stephens, I thought I ought to tell you I saw a strange man lurking around outside.
He's lurking around inside here, isn't he?
This is Mr. Finglehoff.
Fergus F. Finglehoff.
He's a friend of Darrin's.
Darrin's?
Yes.
He's been waiting for him.
He and my husband have been working together, haven't you, Mr?
I should say "professor".
Excuse me, Professor Finglehoff.
Unfortunately, the professor can't wait any longer.
He really must get going.
Darrin's just going to be sick to have missed him.
That's a shame.
That is the most ridiculous nonsense I ever heard.
You can lie all you want about your husband but when you talk about me, make it the truth.
"Professor," indeed.
You expect this woman to believe a half-baked story like that?
The truth of the matter, madam, is that I am a frog.
- A frog?
- Oh, Fergus.
You'd think it was something to be ashamed of to make up such a fantastic.
Au contraire, madam.
I am proud and happy that I am a frog.
- Fergus!
- You are?
You see?
She appreciates the predicament I'm in.
Thank you for your sympathy, madam.
But if you don't mind we'd like to be alone so she can turn me back into - Fergus!
- Now what?
I mean, really, Sam, you're getting a little shrill, even for a One more word out of you and I'll Well, goodbye, Mr. Fergus.
Mr. Frog.
I mean, professor.
Goodbye.
- Abner!
- Mrs. Kravitz.
Abner!
Fergus you know something?
- No, what?
You're a big-mouthed frog, that's what you are.
A very large, big-mouthed frog.
Maybe I can't turn you back into a frog but there's one thing I can do to get rid of you.
I can send you back to where I found you.
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
I wouldn't do that.
I would.
Now that's what I call dirty pool.
Well, I hope that'll impress Mr. Saunders.
- Oh, no.
- Don't worry.
If that doesn't, I will.
- What are you doing back here?
- I sloshed my way back.
I'm as fond of water as the next frog, but I like to be prepared for a dive.
- I don't like to be taken by surprise.
- Neither do I. Hold it.
I'll only work my way back here again.
But this time, it'll take longer, what with all the stops.
- All what stops?
- In the neighbourhood.
I figure I'll just spread the good word around how the nice folks here have their own personal neighbourhood witch.
- Who'd believe you?
- Oh, maybe nobody will believe me.
But it'll sure cause a lot of talk.
Make a lot of trouble for you.
Especially if I start with Mrs. Kravitz.
It shouldn't be too hard convincing her.
We team up, we can sing a beautiful duet.
Personally, I think we got a possible album.
- Are you trying to blackmail me?
- Nope.
I am blackmailing you.
I don't blackmail that easily.
Honey, we're here.
Except when my husband comes home with a client.
- Let me take your coat, Mr. Saunders.
- Thank you.
Now, Fergus.
Try to be nice until I can think of something to do about you.
Me?
Charlie Charming?
- Hi, honey.
- Hi.
- This is Mr. Saunders.
- Oh, Mr. Saunders.
It's so nice to meet you.
We're a big Saunders' Soup family.
And your frozen dinners?
All marvellous.
So tasty.
And your sauces, your chili sauce!
And your mustard.
It's the greatest mustard.
Let's see.
Have I forgotten anything?
- Well, not that I know of.
- Perhaps only one small item, dear.
- What?
- The gentleman standing there.
I don't think we caught his name.
Oh, forgive me.
How could I?
Oh, that must be Larry and Louise.
Make yourself comfortable, Mr. Saunders.
Well, just show me where the bar is and I will.
Oh, Louise, Larry.
Come on in.
- Darrin, it's Larry and Louise.
- I know.
We've met.
- You know Mr. Saunders, of course.
- Yes, yes.
Mr. Saunders.
Oh, good, Darrin.
You brought the new layouts for the soup.
Well, Larry, Louise Mr. Saunders, Darrin get set.
I have a little surprise for you.
Will you hurry up?
He's liable to be gone.
If you'd been home when I got home, we could've come back then.
But no, you were at the dentist, wasting precious time, having a tooth pulled.
Look.
I'd rather have a tooth pulled than go out looking at frogs with you.
Call me peculiar.
There he is.
He's a human frog.
What?
What did she call me?
A human frog.
You said the bar was this way?
Sam, what's going on?
He's a human frog.
- Will you please not get hysterical?
- Darrin, what is this?
Larry, obviously there's some mistake.
- Why, I should hope so.
- Sam, in the name of Let me hear you deny it.
Deny that you came right out and told me that you were a human frog.
I will, indeed.
I never for an instant said that I was a human frog.
I deny that.
I deny it categorically, emphatically and intramurally.
Satisfied, Mrs. World-Champ- Official-Butt-in-Artist?
No.
Well, why would anyone say that anybody was a human frog?
Unless, of course, they were drinking.
Speaking of drink Good point, sir.
Actually, the last thing any frog worth his salt would want to be is human.
- What was your name again?
- What was your name again?
I was just about to introduce everybody when the Kravitzes came in.
I realize how you could've gotten the wrong impression.
Here she goes again.
Always an explanation.
I was wondering when you'd notice that.
I'm sure it's a good one.
The professor has been doing research and experiments.
- Research, experiments?
- Professor of what?
Professor Fergus Finglehoff.
From one of your schools?
No, no, dear.
From one of yours.
Don't you remember?
Which one was that?
I must have a mental block.
I went to Dartmouth.
We drank a lot there.
Anyway, the professor did say that he was interested in frogs.
Oh, sure.
No, that part is definitely true.
Anyway, the professor's been doing some special research on them.
Well, I'll buy that.
So you must have misunderstood and thought he said he was one.
- That's strange.
- That isn't.
She is.
- Why don't we have a drink on that?
- Sorry, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, don't apologize, Mr. Kravitz.
No harm done.
Speak for yourself.
I'm all shook up.
I wouldn't call a dog a human frog.
- Come on, Gladys.
- Someday, somehow, someplace somebody's gonna believe me.
- That poor woman.
- She is a bit spooky.
Larry, why don't you do the honours and fix everybody a drink.
- Say, that's a good idea.
- Sure, Darrin.
I'll help Sam in the kitchen.
- What's yours, professor?
- What's my what?
I'll have a double anything.
He is a frog.
Sam, make it reasonable.
Darrin, you remember the fairy tale about the princess that put a frog on her pillow?
And the next morning when she woke up he'd turned into a handsome prince?
It's the same thing, only in reverse.
I'll bet the princess's mother and father didn't believe that story either.
Oh, Darrin.
Now, he can cause trouble.
We'll have to go along with him until I can think of something to do.
And it's dangerous to leave him out there with the others too long.
You take it from me, buster.
The frogs have it made.
I'm telling you, frogs know how to live.
Now, professor, let's not talk shop.
About your soup, Mr. Saunders didn't I hear something about a new one?
Yes, indeed.
Fifty-nine coming up.
Congratulations.
What kind is number 59 going to be?
I haven't heard.
Nobody's heard.
Happens to be a big secret.
We're gonna spring it on the public next month with the layouts Darrin's been working on.
Terrific.
Think for a minute.
Have you ever seen a frog on an analyst's couch?
Sober?
No.
Please, no more about frogs.
Did you ever hear of a frog war?
- Frog war?
- Nobody's ever heard of a frog war.
About soup, Mr. Saunders Sam, I think we've heard enough about soup too.
Oh, darling, don't be ridiculous.
I'm just dying to hear all about it.
- No, Sam.
- What's number 59 going to be?
Sam, it's a secret.
A good secret.
Wouldn't you rather hear about frogs?
- No.
Mr. Saunders?
- Sam.
Okay, I'll tell.
Turtle.
Turtle soup.
That's number 59.
Saunders' Sautéed Turtle Soup.
You're gonna make soup out of turtles?
Yeah.
Anything wrong with that?
Well, it all depends.
Do they happen to be any turtles I know?
I think I need another drink.
Tony Terwilliger, Tubby Sloaner or Tiny Tuner?
Because if they are!
Sam, do something.
Some frogs never learn.
I don't like the idea of going to dinner without you.
That's all right.
I'm sure there's a bar at the restaurant.
We can't very well leave the professor.
- He was so embarrassed.
- He certainly disappeared in a hurry.
Did you see the way he flew up those stairs?
- No.
- Neither did I. - You missed that?
- So did I. But I don't mind.
Say, what time do the bars close around here?
Really, Samantha.
Do you have to stay home and babysit with the professor?
Well, since Aunt Clara didn't show up to babysit with Tabatha we really should stay home.
I don't think that the professor is the babysitting type, do you?
Frankly, I didn't figure out his type at all.
- See you tomorrow.
Good night.
- Good night.
I want you to know that I've had a perfectly bourbon time.
What are you doing?
I am praying that Fergus doesn't come up and run into them.
You check the back way.
See if he's there.
Yeah, I told you, I'm doing everything I can.
But she keeps zapping me back into that fountain.
Sam.
- Fergus?
- By the gazebo.
Phoebe, will you shut up and listen?
Believe me, pussycat, I've been after her all day.
Is it my fault if I end up with a musical-comedy witch, a rank amateur?
I know I shouldn't have done it.
I admit it.
I made the biggest mistake of my life.
What mistake, Fergus?
Why don't you come inside and bring Phoebe with you?
I'd like to hear about your mistake.
And this is my girlfriend, Phoebe Plotsky.
Well.
How do you do?
Fergus, have you been carrying Phoebe around in your pocket all this time?
Oh, poor Fergus.
Poor Phoebe.
Honey, I know you can't turn Fergus back into a frog, but couldn't you?
Change Phoebe into a human being.
Oh, darling, that's a marvellous idea.
What do you say, Phoebe?
Oh, good.
Fergus?
Anything.
As long as we're together.
All right now, Phoebe.
You just sit right there.
Sit there.
Spirit of the grinch and grebe Mak e a lady out of Phoebe - Fergus, oh, Fergus!
- Oh, Phoebe, baby, sweetie.
Oh, you'll never know how much l Hey.
Sam.
What's the matter?
Sam, I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but you goofed.
- Goofed?
- Sam goofed?
Well, look at her.
She's definitely lost something in the transformation.
She was a sensational-looking frog.
But how can I ask her to go through life looking like this?
Where's her nice, big, fat neck?
And look at those little beady eyes.
And you call those legs?
Oh, why did I ever make that wish in the first place?
- What wish?
- Tell her, Fergus.
Well, I heard about this old witch over near the swamp.
- So I went over and asked - Asked?
He hocked everything he owned.
His lily pad, his underwater gear.
Okay, so I bought a wish.
I wanted to be human.
I was a big frog in a little pool who thought he could be a bigger one in a bigger pool.
The only thing is, I forgot about Phoebe.
It never occurred to me that if I were turned into a human, I'd be without her.
Fergus, if you bought a wish and brought all this on yourself, there's no problem.
Any witch can unhex that.
Why didn't you tell me that in the beginning?
I didn't think you'd want to help me if you knew what a no-good disgrace to the amphibian world I was.
Sam, you mean you can turn him back into a frog?
Certainly, if that's what he wants.
How about it, Fergus?
You mean, we've got a choice?
Phoebe, we've got a choice.
Want a little time to think it over?
Yeah.
Just once in my life, I wanna look before I leap.
Okay, Sam.
Well, have you made up your mind?
But first off, I gotta be honest.
Why, you didn't goof.
She's sensational-looking in either world.
That's why I insisted that Phoebe make the decision.
Well, what's it gonna be, Phoebe?
Yeah, come on.
We can't stand the suspense.
Well, we wanna go back.
Oh, I'm glad.
Because you know something, Fergus?
I feel that deep in your heart, you are first, last, and always a frog.
So all right, already.
Will you make with the hocus-pocus?
From polliwogs come great big frogs We'll never know quite how It's easier to turn a bee Into a purple cow So hark, ye witches Now pay heed Reverse this spell With haste and speed With no regrets Man into toad He'll hop the straight And narrow road Well, so long, kids.
Been nice meeting you.
Oh, it certainly has.
Don't forget to write.
- Why, Mrs. Kravitz.
- I came to apologize for seeing frogs.
But what am I seeing now?
Oh, these are our friends.
We were just saying good night to them.
Bye-bye, Phoebe.
Bye, Fergus.
Give our love to Tony, Tubby and Tiny.
That's Fergus?
- No, that's Fergus.
- That's Phoebe.
But they're frogs.
Of course they are.
Any reason why they shouldn't be?
Abner.
Abner!
Abner!
- What?
- I don't know.
Just seems to me I've heard that scream before.
Ain't love grand?
In any language.
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
Hello.
Max Grand's Drugstore?
Oh, hi, Evelyn.
This is Mrs. Stephens.
I was wondering Bless you.
Could you deliver a hot water bottle?
Oh, I see.
Well, just tell your delivery boy to go home and go to bed keep warm, drink plenty of liquids and get a lot of rest.
Yes.
Bye.
Oh, dear.
Darling, forgive me for being so late.
Late for what?
Have you forgotten?
We had a date to go shopping.
Well, I'm sorry, Mother, but I can't leave.
Darrin's not well.
What's new about that?
His head is so stuffed up he can hardly breathe.
Well, it can only be an improvement, Samantha.
Oh, Mother.
Now, I'm going to go out and get him a hot water bottle.
Would you stay till I get back?
- Well - Oh, please?
- Oh, all right.
- Thank you.
Darling, I'm gonna go out and get you a hot water bottle.
Okay.
Dr. Altman's gonna send over one of his associates.
- Good.
- And Mother's here.
- Did you hear me?
- I heard you.
Well, I'll only be gone a minute.
Mother's gonna take care of Tabatha.
Then can we go shopping?
Oh, Mother, that's impossible, unless Darrin gets well in a hurry.
Guess who's going to get better in a hurry.
For your information, I was about to enter my bath.
Oh, I'm so sorry, Dr. Bombay but this is something of an emergency.
You know perfectly well my practice is limited to our own people.
But I thought just this teensy-weensy once you'd make an exception.
For me?
Pretty please?
Endora, some women can get away with being coy.
You are not among their number.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll get back to my bath.
If he doesn't get better, Samantha will be tied to this house all week.
Unfortunate.
She won't be able to go to Paris.
Regrettable.
I'll just have to get Dr. Agrafor to replace you as our family doctor.
- Where's the patient?
- Right this way.
I wanna thank you for coming over to see me, doctor since I'm not one of your regular patients.
No, I'd say you're a most irregular patient.
Pardon?
Lean forward.
What's the matter?
- I'm only human.
- Sorry, I forgot about that.
- I think I've located your difficulty.
- What is it?
You have a cold.
I have a cold.
- That's what I just said.
- That's where I heard it.
These pills will do the trick.
- Antibiotics?
- Antibiotics only bore a cold to death.
Take one of those pills.
Your cold will be cured instantly.
- That's amazing.
Who puts these out?
- I do.
Well, are they safe?
I can assure you they have been untouched by human hands.
Yeah, but how come nobody ever Ever If there's going to be another monsoon, I'd better leave.
Wait, wait, wait.
Just a minute, doctor.
It's gone!
My cold's gone!
I never make idle promises.
But this is amazing!
Have you thought of putting these out commercially?
- What for?
- You could make an awful lot of money.
What would I do with money?
The same thing everybody else does.
Buy things.
Planes, boats, cars, houses, you name it.
I can assure you, I have no need for any of those things.
May I tell you something, doctor?
It's amazing to find someone who doesn't care about money.
You're quite unique.
For your information, you are concurring with a vast body of opinion.
Can you get that, Endora?
No.
I'm busy with the baby.
I'll be right back.
- Larry, what a surprise!
- What are you doing out of bed?
Sam said you couldn't lift your head off the pillow.
- You're supposed to be suffering.
- I feel fine.
Oh, that's marvellous, just marvellous.
Here I am, dragging myself to work with a temperature of 101 degrees and you're at home, feeling fine.
Less than a minute ago, I was upstairs.
I was coughing, sneezing, my head was stuffed.
The doctor gave me these pills.
I took one and the cold disappeared.
- A little hard to believe, huh?
- No, it's not a little hard to believe.
It's impossible to believe.
You want the surprise of your life?
Take one of these pills.
You're gonna carry this charade out to the bitter end, eh?
I'm truly grateful to you, Dr. Bombay.
I wish there was some way I could repay you.
- There is.
- In what way?
Allow me to get on with my bath.
- Incredible!
- Did I tell you?
There's a million dollars in this bottle.
- A million?
A billion!
- Where are you going?
Where do you think?
To talk to the doctor.
But he's a dedicated scientist.
He doesn't care about money.
Doesn't care about money?
Well.
Well, if money doesn't mean anything to him, something else does.
Everybody has an Achilles' heel, a weak spot, my boy.
And as you know, I have a Ph.D. In weak heels.
I just got Tabatha to sleep.
We're just going to see the doctor.
- Oh, he's gone.
- Gone!
We didn't see him come downstairs.
Well, I mean, he's really gone.
You know, way out.
You're not kidding.
Come on, Lar.
I'll go up and send him down.
I just don't want you to wake the baby.
Say, you know what I was thinking?
If we tie up the doctor, Hornbeck will be in this afternoon.
Yeah.
And can you imagine what a pill like this would mean to a business like Hornbeck Pharmaceuticals?
Yeah.
And for his partners.
He doesn't have any partners.
He will.
Oh, I'm so sorry.
I know a doctor isn't supposed to have a life of his own, but this is ridiculous.
How was I to know you were still in your bath?
I take long baths.
Dr. Agrafor takes short showers.
Dr. Bombay, believe me, I know your type.
Selfless, dedicated, devoted to your work.
And I ask, is it fair for you to deny your remedy to the rest of humanity?
It so happens that humanity, as you call it, is not my concern.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I prescribe it whenever it's necessary.
Doctor I make you this offer.
Put yourself in my hands and you will go down with the great of medicine.
Lister, Pasteur, Madame Curie Sir, I'll thank you not to classify me among the amateurs.
Doctor.
Let me show you the big picture.
How many people in the world?
Three billion, four?
Let's say they live in a billion homes.
Now, think of this, doctor.
In a billion bathrooms around the world there is a bottle in the medicine chest.
And emblazoned across the label is the name: "Dr. Bombay".
And below the name your picture.
In colour.
Yes.
Yes.
That might be rather nice.
Bingo.
Now, what do you say we draw up a little agreement, Dr. Achilles?
I mean, Dr. Bombay.
Anything to get me back to my bath.
Honey, I'm home.
Did the doctor come?
He sure did.
In fact, you just missed him.
What are you doing out of bed?
An incredible thing happened.
The doctor gave me pills and cured my cold, like that.
Something more important happened.
Sam, you won't have to go shopping anymore.
- The shops will come to you.
- What are you talking about?
The pills the doctor gave me.
They cure the common cold.
- And we've got the rights to them!
- Honey, we're rich!
Wait a minute.
I want to know.
Was that the doctor that Dr. Altman sent?
Yeah, great guy.
A little eccentric - Who cares?
Come on, Darrin.
- What was his name?
- Dr. Bombay.
Bye, honey.
- Doc Dr. Bombay!
Mother?
Mother!
Oh, you're back.
- Mother, how could you!
- Oh, you mean Dr. Bombay?
Oh, I wouldn't worry, darling.
He cured what's-his-name's cold.
And now we can hop over to Paris.
Mother, for your information I had no intention of hopping anywhere.
I was simply humouring you.
I have to find out what was in those pills.
You get that quack right back here.
I wouldn't dream of disturbing him again.
- Very well, I'll go to him.
- Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you.
Well, you're not.
And I'm going to.
You see?
Mama knows best.
Well, what Mama knows worst is how to mind her own business.
Show him in, please.
He's here.
Boy, am I going to enjoy this.
Me too.
The old buzzard.
Good afternoon, Mr. Hornbeck.
How are you?
Did I answer your question?
Let's get down to business.
- Sir - lf you don't have a campaign that'll stop our sagging sales, you're through.
- Do you read me?
- Oh, yes, sir.
Like a book.
- A bestseller.
- Before we discuss the new campaign None of your elaborate stalls.
If you don't have anything, just say so and I'll leave.
We've got something to show you.
- Now?
- Now.
- Sir?
- " Found, a cure for the common cold.
Dr. Bombay's Cold Bombs".
- Well?
- How about that?
I'll tell you how about that.
You people have flipped.
You don't know one account from another.
That isn't even one of my products.
- That's what we're leading up to.
- What are you babbling about?
What if I told you that we ran into a doctor who found a cure for the common cold?
I'd say put him away with the guy who claims he can grow hair.
Mr. Hornbeck, you're in for the biggest surprise of your life.
Here.
Incredible.
Absolutely incredible.
I'm so sorry I misjudged you.
What is this going to cost me?
It isn't going to cost us anything, partner.
- "Partner"?
- Naturally.
Naturally, but the name's all wrong.
It's corny.
- We'll have to change that.
- We can't do that.
Dr. Bombay is the man who found the cure.
The name is part of our deal with him.
Dr. Bombay.
Has a bit of a ring, hasn't it?
You again.
Didn't I tell you to knock?
I knew you wouldn't be taking a bath in here.
Dr. Bombay, I'm worried about the pills you gave my husband.
Why?
He got rid of his cold, didn't he?
- Have you ever given them to humans?
- No.
Then how do you know they're safe for a human to take?
I'll soon find out, won't I?
That's not fair.
They might have some terrible side effect.
My dear girl, how is a scientist to learn unless he experiments?
You also gave them permission to market them.
You shouldn't have done that.
Samantha, can't you see I'm busy?
- What's that?
- Chicken soup.
Care for a bowl?
- Not bad, not bad.
- Thirty-four and a half.
Here's a beautiful 55-room home.
Has its own lake.
I can put you in it for, oh, 330,000.
- I don't think so.
- How about a topcoat?
There's a steal on an 80-foot cruiser.
Sleeps ten, twin diesels.
Yes, put him on.
How much?
Ninety-two thousand.
It's a hardship case.
Larry, don't you think this is a little premature?
Are you kidding?
You saw the way Hornbeck flipped.
He and his lawyer will be here in half an hour.
Those agreements are as good as signed.
Can't you get it through your head we're filthy rich?
Show him a boat.
Oh, hi, Fred.
Remember that talk we had about you buying me out?
Well, I'm ready to talk.
Yeah, give me a call in a day or two and we'll get together.
All right.
You're going to sell out?
What do I need an advertising business for?
- That looks like a castle.
- It is.
On the Rhine.
Put that aside.
Here we go.
Hello.
I'll tell him.
Sam's in your office.
Make it fast, will you?
Before Hornbeck gets here.
Say I like that one with the smokestack.
You mean You mean he's a witch doctor?
Well, we call him a "warlock doctor".
And those pills aren't If that woman weren't your mother, I'd And I may do it anyway!
I gotta stop Larry.
Sweetheart, wait, there's one more thing He's gone hog wild.
If I don't stop him, he may ruin both of us!
What happened?
That must be the side effect.
Side effect?
Dr. Bombay's pills.
That's what I was trying to warn you about.
How long is this going to last?
I don't know.
I guess I'll just have to pop back to Dr. Bombay's office and see if he has an antidote.
Well, you'd better hurry, because - Hello?
- Where's Mr. Stephens?
He just stepped out.
Would you tell him that Mr. Hornbeck and his lawyer are on the way in?
Yes, sir.
Will you please hurry!
This is ridiculous.
We're building an empire and he's visiting with his wife.
It's not like him.
- It's like her.
- What?
- Yes, sir?
- Hasn't he come back yet?
No, I'm sorry, he hasn't.
- Well, it's about time.
- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
He guarantees one of these will lower your voice.
Thank you.
Well?
Could you speak up a little bit?
Speak a little slower, sweetheart.
I'm trying to read your lips.
Gonna kill who?
Your mother!
I'll be right back.
- Too low, eh?
- He can't talk at all.
Well, is that so terrible?
I've met him, and he doesn't seem to have much to say.
Dr. Bombay, how would you like to be reported to the Witches' Medical Association?
Now, now, now, let's remain calm and not indulge in idle threats.
You know you're not supposed to practice on humans.
Get up off your hassock and give me something that'll bring my husband's voice back, or else.
Really, Sam.
There's really only one way to do it, you know.
- What's that?
- Well, I'd have to No, no, no.
It's simply out of the question for a doctor of my far-flung reputation.
Whatever it is, you had better do it and do it quick.
Or you have no idea how far-flung you will be.
Well, come on.
Hornbeck's blowing his top.
Okay, so you lost your voice.
You can still listen, can't you?
Come on.
Well, I found him.
Sit down.
And listen.
Go ahead, Mr. Hornbeck.
We were discussing whether to go public or hold onto the stock ourselves.
- I say, why share a gold mine?
We can always go into public issue later.
What do you think?
You can nod your head, can't you?
Do you think we should go public?
You mean we should keep the stock among the three of us?
What's the matter with him?
I think I know what it is.
This is the big one.
The chance we've all dreamed of.
And I think he's got a little stage fright, that's all.
That's probably why you lost your voice.
- What's wrong with you?
- My voice.
- Listen to me.
- What happened?
I don't know!
I don't know!
"Pills".
Side effects?
I think we've talked long enough.
Let's sign the agreements, get it over with.
I've got a better idea.
Why don't we just forget the whole thing?
- You're joking, of course.
- I wish I was.
Mr. Hornbeck, those pills have a side effect.
Who do you think you're kidding?
Stephens disappears, comes back hands you a note, now you're trying to back out.
I know what's going on.
You wanna give it to another company!
It's the bait and double cross!
Now you have it too, Mr. Hornbeck.
- So have you!
- No, I didn't take any pill.
This is the way I talk all the time.
- Yes?
- Mr. Tate?
Mrs. Stephens is here again.
Hi.
I thought it might be rather nice to drink a toast to the new company.
Forget it, Sam.
We're out of business.
Oh, Mr. Hornbeck, this is Mrs. Stephens.
- How do you do?
- You too, huh?
No sense in letting this go to waste.
Sam, do you know where we could find Bombay?
On the road to Mandalay?
No!
I mean the quack who conned us into this whole pill deal.
Those pills of his have side effects.
Is that why your voices all sound so funny?
It's not so funny to me.
Here, sweetheart.
Drink this.
Champagne's been known to work wonders.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Sam, it's very good.
My voice!
My voice came back!
It worked.
Maybe it'll help you fellas.
You're right, this Hey!
I'm back to normal too.
Hope I can get mine back.
It is back!
Didn't do a thing for me.
When I think of how close we came to an international disaster.
Tate, this is another example of one of your feeble Feeble Bless you.
I got my cold back again.
Mr. Hornbeck, how was I to know Know Bless you.
This is no place for a lawyer who's still got his health.
- I'll see you all.
- Wait.
I'll drop you off in my cab.
- Thanks, I'll take my own cab.
- I hope you'll give me an opportunity to make up for this goof.
Why?
So you can top it with another goof?
So this is Dr. Bombay's magic formula.
Yes, sweetheart.
I had to drag it out of him.
He made me promise never to tell anyone that he gave me a prescription to catch a cold.
Well, I suppose anything's better than Oh, darling, that's marvellous.
You're back to normal.
Well?
I know, Darrin.
I was saying to Louise when I was telling her about Hornbeck that the last three years have been one disappointment after another.
- Some good things have happened too.
- Not in the last three years.
How many years you been with us, Darrin?
Three years.
Now wait a minute, Larry!
You're blaming me because Hornbeck pulled out?
And who introduced me to that kook Dr. Bombay?
And who badgered him into giving us the rights?
One of your severest faults is that you can't accept blame.
I can't?
How about?
- Yes?
- Mr. Hornbeck and his lawyer are here.
Lawyer?
- He's gonna sue us.
- Has he got any grounds?
I don't know.
Have them come in.
That's all I need right now, is a lawsuit.
As if I don't have enough suits.
And boats.
I'm sorry.
I'm getting hysterical.
Mr. Hornbeck, before you say anything, Stephens wants to make a statement.
- Me?
- I want you to tell Mr. Hornbeck that you are personally responsible for discovering Dr. Bombay and his pills.
- Just a minute!
- I knew you were the bright one!
Where can I find this Dr. Bombay?
- I wanna make a deal with him.
- What about the side effect?
Side effects, plural.
- There's another one?
- I'll say.
What is it?
Prager, get out those agreements.
Boys, get out your pens.
We're back in business once again.
I just thought of a slogan: "Gone tomorrow.
Hair today".
Don't like it, huh?
Forget it.
I'm going to build an empire that's the greatest ever seen.
You with me?
