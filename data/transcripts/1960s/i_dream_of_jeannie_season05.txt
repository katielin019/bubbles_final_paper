Uh, this is trash.
Oh, boy.
More trash.
There's classified trash.
Get that, will you, Roge?
Hello.
Major Nelson's office.
Ah, no, she's not here now.
Have you tried her bottle?
It's for Jeannie.
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, we'll accept the charges.
Where is it from?
Babylon?
Thank you, Major Healey.
Hello.
Oh, hello, auntie.
How nice of you to call.
Jeannie, would you get out of here, please?
We're expecting a lot of people in here.
Just one moment, master.
Oh, boy.
Yes, I am here, auntie.
What?
Oh!
A surprise?
Ha, ha.
Oh, well, I do not know Jeannie, please.
Wait a minute.
Give her a chance, will you?
It's a long-distance call.
Yeah, from Babylon.
Do you have any idea what that costs?
Yes.
Auntie, look, could you tell me what the surprise is?
Oh.
Uh-huh.
Oh.
Yeah, well, that is true.
Ha.
It would not be a surprise if you told me what it was.
Um, well, in that case, I will have to ask my master.
Just one minute, please.
Master, Aunt Malama is sending Y-yeah, anything.
Anything you want, just get off.
He agrees.
He agrees.
Oh, yes, Aunt Malama.
Oh, we both thank you.
Goodbye.
Heh-heh-heh.
That was Aunt Malama from Babylon.
She She is just a little bit eccentric for a genie.
Yeah?
Mm.
She likes to use the telephone because she thinks it's magic.
Ha!
She thinks it's magic.
Major Nelson, what's blocking this door?
Stall him.
Hey, stall him.
Shh-shh.
Uh, there's a couple of boxes out there.
What do you want me to do?
Just I can't stall him.
I can't Shh.
Now, master, she's sent me a surprise.
Oh, good.
What kind of a surprise?
Oh, I do not know.
She would not tell me.
But she sends the best surprises in the whole world.
Oh, good, good, good.
Darling, just go home right now, would you, please?
I wonder what it is.
I don't care what it is.
It doesn't matter.
Please, just go home.
Oh, but she is sending it here.
Out!
Agh!
Thank you.
Djinn-Djinn.
Be calm.
Remember where you are and don't get excited.
I'd like to explain about the sandwich I ate in the capsule.
What are you talking about?
Major, why is all this debris?
Great heavens.
That dog.
Uh, no, this is not the dog you're thinking of, sir.
This is another dog.
It looks just like it.
Ha-ha.
Hi, Djinn-Djinn.
Shred any uniforms lately?
Djinn-Djinn.
That's the name of the dog.
I knew it was the same one.
Thanks, Roge.
Major, what are you thinking about?
Do you realize the last time that dog was on this base it almost destroyed the entire space program?
Oh, well, he was just a little puppy then, sir.
Yeah, but he's full grown now.
Think what he could do.
Uh, what I meant, sir, he's, ah He's been in training.
As a matter of fact, the owner says he's been to obedience school.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, he's sort of an obedience-school dropout.
Ha, ha, ha.
Thanks.
I needed that.
Yeah.
Well, there's still no reason to bring a dog to a military installation.
Roger, would you take the dog?
I don't want the dog.
Take the dog.
Take the dog.
You see, sir?
You see how friendly he is?
Well, that's no excuse to bring him to a military installation.
Don't Don't put on your coat.
Sir, please don't put on your Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
T Major Healey, what are you doing?
Oh, uh, just Just petting the dog, sir.
Ha-ha.
Tony, the og-day has isappeared-day.
Oh, the og-day.
Oh, ho-ho.
Sir, as soon as we get this place cleaned up, I'll get rid of the dog.
You don't have to worry.
Well, see that you do.
And friendly or not, just remember that NASA is no place for animals.
Yes, sir.
Yes.
And I wanna see you in my off  Heavens.
What?
He's biting me.
What?
What?
And I'm telling you, Major Nelson, if I ever see that saboteur on this base again Please, sir, don't shout.
The If I ever see it here again I hope we get that air coming in soon.
Would you hold that, please?
Well, what's all this?
It's all right, general.
I'm taking care of it.
Oh, a cute little puppy dog.
Is it yours, major?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Well, what's his name?
Oh, be careful, be careful.
His name's Djinn-Djinn, sir.
I'm keeping it for a friend of mine.
Yes, sir.
I was telling major that NASA is no place for dogs.
Oh, don't be so hard-nosed, doctor.
Remember the landing module's named after a dog.
Ha, ha.
Yeah, Snoopy.
Snoo Right.
That's right, it is.
Nothing wrong with bringing him here, as long as he's well-trained.
Well-trained?
Very well-trained.
Yes.
He went to obedience school, and has a blue ribbon with clusters.
That's ridiculous.
Excuse me.
Oh!
Miss!
Obedience school, huh?
General!
Here, let me see.
I-I'll be right there.
Obedience school, huh?
I don't think you'd like to hold it.
Oh, yes.
You know, my Jupiter Roger!
Won second place in the eastern division obedience trials the last two years running.
Oh, is that right?
But this year, he'll be first.
Oh, that's very interesting, sir.
Hey, as a matter of fact, the big meet's next Sunday.
I'm giving Jupiter his last workout tomorrow.
Say, why don't you bring Djinn-Djinn to the park tomorrow and we'll see how he stacks up to a real champion?
Uh, well, I-I T-tomorrow's almost impossible, sir.
I d-don't I I Heh, oh, well, thank you.
Good.
Shall we say 10:00?
Ten o'clock?
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, doctor, get some decent trousers.
This is a military installation.
Oh, yes, sir.
Uh, I'm sorry  Oh, my coat, major.

Feisty, isn't he?
Yeah, ha-ha, feisty.
Well-trained.
Really.
Nyeh.
Roger!
Roger!
Oh, but, master, I've not seen him in such a long time.
And it is only for the weekend.
In a weekend, he could destroy Cocoa Beach.
Oh, no, no, no, master.
It is only uniforms that upset him.
He will go nowhere near NASA.
And And And And he loves you.
He loves you.
Hello, Djinn-Djinn.
Oh, okay.
Oh!
Thank you.
Mm.

Uh, b-but just for three days.
And he's not to go anywhere near NASA.
Nowhere near.
Understand?
What are you going to tell General Schaeffer?
I don't know.
I'll think of something.
Ohhhh!
All right, Roger, I want you to back me up.
The owner came for the dog, and that's that, okay?
He had to go back to Babylon.
Huh?
Just forget it.
Just don't say anything.
Okay.
As soon as my master has talked to General Schaeffer, he will come home and play with you, I promise.

He wouldn't move until I released him if his life depended on it.
Tomorrow, first prize for sure.
A marvelous dog, sir.
Hey, where's Djinn-Djinn?
I'm anxious to see how he stacks up to my Jupiter.
Ahem.
Well, that's what I wanted to talk to you about, sir.
The owner, uh, came by this morning and said that, uh, we couldn't Uh, well, he, uh He came by unexpectedly, sir.
It seems It seemed that the little boy missed the dog so much that they decided to take him along on the weekend.
Oh, Tony's very broken-hearted about it, sir.
He was counting on working his little pup up with your Jupiter.
What are you talking about, major?
There's Djinn-Djinn.
Oh, yeah.
What Roger meant was that, uh, when I explained what we wanted to do with Djinn-Djinn, uh, the owner agreed to let him stay.

I thought I'd drop by to see how things were doing.
Where's the little one, Djinn-Djinn?
The little one, Djinn-Djinn?
Ah!
Never mind.
I know where he is.
At least I think I do.
Oh!
Uh, uh, major.
W     General, look at my pants.
I told you that dog was a disaster.
All right, doctor, you were right, but this is no time to remind me.
Jupiter!
Stay!
That's an order!
Agh!
Jupiter, heel!
Jupiter!
When I get my hands on that mutt Well, I'm sure it's not your dog's fault, sir.
It's that Djinn-Djinn.
That's who I'm talking about!
If I get my hands on that mutt How does it feel to be locked up in a capsule?
Well, not too bad.
It's It's a little stuffy in this phone booth, though.
Heh-heh.
Yeah, it sure does.
Yeah.
What?
What phone call?
Oh, the emergency phone call.
Yeah, keep Keep ringing.
Yeah, k Don't go away.
Don't go away.

A friend of mine just went by.
Hi, Jupiter.
Heh-heh.
Yeah, I've got a lot of friends around here.
Yeah, that's right.
Aghhh!
Agh!
Major Nelson, where's Jupiter?
Where did he go?
Are you all right?
Ugh.
Which way did he go, major?
Oh.
Just Which way did Jupiter go, major?
You are without a doubt Don't you remember anything?
Can?
Can you speak up?
There seems to be some noise at your end.
Ah, that's better.
Ah, about tonight, y-you wanna meet me at the office?
Okay.
I'll pick you up at your place, okay?
Oh, yeah, and about that emergency call, you wanna forget about that and call the telephone company repair truck?
Okay.
Bye-bye, now.
Bye.
Ha.
Uh.
Oh, hello.
I didn't get my dime back.
Hello?
Years of training, major.
Countless hours of patience, discipline, kindness.
Gone.
All gone in a single morning.
I'm begging your pardon, sir.
I-isn't it perfectly natural for a dog to get excited when it meets another dog?
That isn't a dog, major.
That's a canine pied piper.
And you said he was trained.
Tie only training that dog's had is in guerilla warfare.
I'm I'm extremely sorry, sir.
I truly am sorry.
Sorry, major?
Sorry?
Jupiter's lost.
Gone.
My friend, my companion, and also my chances to win that obedience trial tomorrow.
Gone.
He has no right to be so angry, master.
Djinn-Djinn is gone too.
What?
What's that, major?
Uh, I said Djinn-Djinn's gone too.
And thank heavens.
I'm running out of trousers.
I just want you to know, major, that if Jupiter isn't found by tomorrow, I am holding you responsible.
Yes, of course, sir.
Oh, good news, sir.
We found it.
Where?
At the pound.
Which dog?
Oh, Jupiter.
I didn't ask about Djinn-Djinn.
I figured he could take care of himself.
Oh, well, let's go.
Uh, me too, sir?
Well, aren't you anxious to find out whether they got Djinn-Djinn?
Not particularly.
Master.
Major.
Huh?
Oh.
Arnold P. Dockweiler.
I'm the Cocoa Beach dog catcher, and I wanna speak to the supervisor personally.
Why?
I want him to call out the National Guard.
I've got a canine revolution on my hands.
You sure you got the message right?
At least let's try, then.
That's right.
Dogs.
I think they've all gone crazy.
Djinn-Djinn's here all right.
Hm?
Excuse me.
Go away.
You can't see the dogs today.
But this man called.
You said you had a Great Dane named Jupiter.
And a little mixed breed, w About this big with long curly hair.
Have him call me back.
Uh, it's an extreme emergency.
So he's your dog.
That, uh That That vicious beast.
Ooh, lightning fast.
Ooh, he strikes before you even know he's coming.
That's Djinn-Djinn.
What about my Great Dane, Jupiter?
Oh, he's in there.
He's in there with the rest of 'em.
Let me tell you something: I wouldn't go in there unless I was in a tank.
Oh, that's ridiculous.
Let me by, please.
I'll get my dog myself.
He's right, general.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
The last time that dog was at NASA, he terrorized the whole base.
You mean to say you're all afraid of a little puppy dog?
Huh, huh.
Well, in that case, I'm asking for volunteers.
It's Tony's dog.
That's right.
And it was Major Nelson who brought him to NASA in the first place.
Thanks, Roge.
Your funeral.
I gotta get ahold of Jeannie.
Master.
Huh?
Oh.
Hello.
Shh-shh.
Dr. Bellows is out there.
Oh, it is all right, master.
I am here.
Yeah.
Oh, is that not darling?
He certainly has them organized, doesn't he?
Djinn-Djinn.
Ooh.
Djinn-Djinn.
Oh, look, master, he wants to play.
Now he wants to play.
Oh, well, I think it best if we humor him.
I'll go over I'll go over and get him.
I'll herd him around this way and you grab him.
Yes, master.
Hey, Djinn-Djinn.
Djinn-Djinn.
Ha, ha, ha.
Djinn-Djinn.
Come on, Djinn-Djinn.
Oh, ha.
There you are.
Jeannie, would you get the lock?
Would you get the lock?
Yes, master.
Thank you.
Here, boy.
Excuse me, Jupiter.
Excuse me.
I'm going in.
Oh, general, uh, sir.
Sir, I think you better take off your jacket.
Why?
Djinn-Djinn.
He attacks uniforms.
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
Sir Uh, sir, your Your hat.
The park is two blocks down, one to the right.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, say something.
Djinn-Djinn.
You are a naughty little dog  But I love you.
Heh.
It is all right, master.
We are going home.
Wait!
Wait!
The cage!
Wait!
I tell you, I need help.
They're gone, every last one of 'em.
It's a full-scale jail break, organized by a little brown mixed-breed.
General Schaeffer, are you all right?
I think so.
You shouldn't have opened You shouldn't have opened that door, sir.
It was like the charge of the light brigade.
Jupiter.
Jupiter.
Oh, Jupiter.
Major Nelson, I don't know what kind of a medal I can recommend you for, but you certainly deserve one for what you did.
Could you just let me out of here, sir?
Oh, yes, yes, of course, major.
Oh, I'll get a key for the lock.
We'll have you out in a second.
Heel, Jupiter, heel.
Attaboy.
What happened to Djinn-Djinn?
Djinn-Djinn is at home with Jeannie.
Boy, are we lucky.
If he was here right now, he'd tear you to shreds.
Agh!
Take the coat off.
Take your coat off.
Take it off.
Djinn-Djinn, go home.
He obeyed.
Hey, it's okay.
He obeyed.
Yeah, it's okay.
Oh, yes.
Uh, you've got the key?
Oh, right here.
He's back, he's back!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Ow!
Maybe you weren't firm enough with him.
Help!
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
Roge, uh, could you hurry it up?
Dr. Bellows frowns on two hour lunches, you know.
Tony, will you please?
I'm trying to make this shot.
Psst.
Psst.
Master.
What are you doing here?
Get out.
Master, which would you prefer: Chicken, fish, or saddle of yak for dinner?
I cannot make up my mind.
You came here in the middle of all these people to ask me that?
Hey, I got 'em now.
Seven to five.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Hello, Major Healey.
Roger Master, I would not have bothered you here at work, except that if you wish the yak, I must go to Tibet for the saddle.
Major Healey, it's nearly 2:00.
Oh, well Well, it's not me, sir.
I'm waiting for Tony.
I was just killing time.
Major Nelson, why are you hunched over like that?
Some sort of, uh, stomach distress?
No, no, everything's fine, sir.
Nothing like that.
I was just tinkling on the old ivories.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
I didn't know you played the piano.
Yeah, I can't.
I can't.
Uh I, uh, took lessons when I was a kid though.
Uh, play something for me.
No, really.
I-I can't, sir.
I wish I could.
It'd be great, but It would be nice.
After After four years of lessons, all I ended up with was "Chopsticks".
Ha, ha.
Bravo!
Bravol I didn't know you could play the piano.
Why, Major Nelson, that was absolutely extraordinary.
And you said you couldn't play.
I can't.
I-I couldn't.
Well, I-I-I didn't know I remembered.
Ha, ha.
Didn't remember?
You didn't even have any music.
Sir, if you'll excuse me.
Of course, major, of course.
We'll postpone our little meeting.
I can't wait to tell General Schaeffer about this.
I-I wish you wouldn't do that, sir.
Major, you can't hide a talent like yours.
Why, I'm no critic, but, uh, I haven't heard music played like this outside of a concert hall.
Oh, well, thank you.
Oh, ah, captain, about that meeting: We'll postpone Tony, that's not talent, that's genius.
You're not too far wrong.
Look.
Look.
Oh.
Wh-whoa.
Sorry.
Major Healey.
Major Healey, be careful.
Major Nelson's fingers are precious.
Uh, yes, sir, watch out for all doors.
Careful with your hands.
You got to watch where you're putting your hands I don't see how you could do a cockeyed like Thing like that to me.
You do not like music?
Yes, of course.
I I love music.
I also like football, but I don't want you to turn me into O.J. Simpson.
I'm sorry.
I just got through telling Dr. Bellows that I can hardly play "Chopsticks" and you turn me into a A Van Cliburn, and Rudolph Serkin and Charley Steinway, for all I know.
Oh, no, master.
I would never do that to you.
Yeah.
I was there, remember?
And so was everybody else.
Oh, but you were not playing.
Well, who was, the?
The Easter Bunny?
The piano.
Yeah I It's like my fingers had a mind of their own.
The piano?
Yes, master.
Do you realize what a great burden of responsibility it would be to have that talent in your fingers?
The hours and hours of drudgery in practice in those sweet, little darling fingers.
I would never do that to you, so I blinked the burden on the piano.
Everybody who sits on the piano could do what I did?
Oh, yes, master.
It has an enormous repertoire.
I Yeah, well, blink it back.
Oh, yes, master.
Ha-ha.
Back where?
Not Not "where".
You blink it back the way it was.
Slow down, doctor, there's nothing in Major Nelson's General Schaeffer.
Get out.
Go on, out, out.
You don't have to believe me, general.
Ask Major Healey.
Ask any of the others who were here.
In fact, it was at that very piano.
Now, I admit it seems strange, but he was telling me that the only thing he could play was "Chopsticks".
Then he sat down here, and he  I'm, uh  Sorry, sir.
When I get the urge to play, I just can't contain myself.
You see, general?
You see?
You're right, doctor.
He's He's magnificent.
Major Nelson, as of this moment, I am taking you off flying status.
Huh?
!
You are going to make a concert tour.
Sir, I'm an astronaut.
I don't know anything about concerts.
Perfect.
Perfect.
He's not only brilliant, he's modest.
Come along, doctor, we have to get in touch with Sol Hurok.
Wait, doctor.
Uh, practice, major, practice.
Sir, w-wait!
Jeannie.
Hello, master, darling.
Oh.
You are late.
Yeah.
Of course I'm late.
I had to babysit with that lunatic piano until everybody left.
Eh, what's all that for?
It is my new gown for your debut.
Do you like it?
Yeah, yeah, it's great, but I'm not gonna have a debut.
Now, how did you know about that, anyhow, huh?
Oh, Master, Major Healey said that Hi, Tony.
What are you all dressed up for, Roger?
How about that?
Does that grab you?
This is what all the leading impresarios wear.
Came with the glasses and everything.
Will somebody please tell me what's going on?
Well Oh, watch the hand.
Oh, watch Watch it.
Well, they couldn't get Sol Hurok, so they had to settle for me.
Well, we've got you booked in Pensacola, Annapolis, West Point Is it not exciting?
The Air Force Academy and Anderson, Indiana.
Uh, wh-what's in Anderson, Indiana?
I got a girl in that town.
Well, she'll just have to wait.
Now cancel everything.
Oh, but master But master, but master, I've been on the phone all day.
I mean, I got everything looked in.
Well, unlock it.
I'm not going on any concert tour.
Oh, do not worry, master.
You will be a huge success.
I shall fix every piano you play.
Jeannie, the only thing I want you to do is blink the one in the recreation room back to normal.
Oh.
Oh, well, I-I could not do that.
Jeannie, that's an order.
Oh, I did not mean I would not.
It is easy enough to put the music in, but once it is in Heh.
Well, it has to play itself out.
Oh, swell.
Listen, Jeannie, what I want you to do I-I believe that I-I shall go and And blink dinner.
Ah, great.
It's all settled.
Ah, she can be my assistant and she can blink all the pianos you play.
And leave a trail of magic pianos all around the country?
Use it.
Use the head.
Think!
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
We'll We'll have to use the piano in the recreation room.
Roger, I'm not using I told you, I'm not go I'm not playing.
Hey, now, wait a minute.
That might be Oh, that's gonna be good publicity.
That's great.
You'll be the only virtuoso who plays concerts on a little red spinet.
Great, great, great.
Roger.
Roger?
Don't forget: Be ready.
Pensacola tomorrow morning.
Careful with the hands.
There's more than one way to tune a piano.
Careful, careful, careful with the keyboard.
Careful, careful.
Oh, Tony, do you have a couple dollars?
I want to tip the guys.
Never mind, I'll get the change from the cashier.
That's terrible, major.
How did it happen?
Just carelessness on my part, sir.
The I didn't know the stove was lit, and Well, it's pretty painful.
I can't move the hand.
Well, we'll have to cancel the tour, of course.
It's obvious you can't play the piano like that.
I'm kind of disappointed.
I was looking forward to making the tour Oh, excuse me, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, the plane's ready.
I'm afraid it's all off, major.
Sorry, Roge.
Major Nelson just burnt his hand.
Burned his hard?
You burned Oh, I'm sorry.
Come on over in the light here.
Look, I took first aid in high school.
Let me take a good look at it.
Wait.
Wait a minute, Roger.
There's nothing wrong with your hand.
It's a burned hand.
Oh.
Yeah.
Oh, it's burned.
Oh, sure.
Yeah, it's burned.
Terrible burn.
A bad one.
Burny burn  Just a moment, major.
Let the doctor take a look at it.
Yeah.
There's nothing wrong with that hand.
Ah, w-well, actually, one of the reasons Oh, I understand, major.
You're just too modest.
You can't stand the thought of being famous.
A few concerts under his belt, he'll be fine.
Well, uh, let's go, maestro.
Uh, yeah Wait, Roger.
Roger, thanks.
I'm gonna remember you for this.
Thanks a lot.
Now, look, fellows, this all may go over subtly Get ready.
He's coming.
I couldn't possibly   Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.
What's this all about, sir?
Well, major, it's just a little gathering of your friends and colleagues to show you how much we appreciate what you've done.
Well, thank you all very much, but I've done nothing, sir.
A New York debut at Symphony Hall tomorrow night and you say it's nothing?
Well, it's certainly been interesting, I could say that, but I want you all to know that tomorrow night's concert is gonna be my last.
We all thought it was a marvelous piece of showmanship that you played all your concerts on NASA's own, uh, battered red spinet.
But, uh, you're beyond that now, so, uh, we took the liberty of getting rid of it and replacing it with the Major Anthony Nelson Memorial Piano.
Uh, please.
"Memorial" piano?
Isn't that?
Isn't that for dead people?
Stick around, Roge.
Major, play.
Huh?
Ha-ha, that's an order.
Well        Roger, how could you let that happen?
Well, the piano was routed for Symphony Hall.
Don't you understand?
Tonight at 8:30 I'm gonna be in Symphony Hall in front of a full orchestra and packed house and what am I going to do without my little red spinet?
Play "Chopsticks".
Ha, ha, ha.
Funny, funny.
They're not gonna think it's funny.
I didn't think it was funny either.
What?
!
What is this?
JEANNIE : Master, master, open up.
Agh.
Jeannie.
Why can't she do anything simply?
Ah-ha.
What do you think you're doing, huh?
What's the big idea?
Well, the drawer closed accidentally and I could not get out, so I had to blink the whole filing cabinet here.
I found it.
Let me see.
Uh, the Cocoa Beach Piano Sales.
Sixty dollar trade-in allowance.
That's it.
The red spinet.
Let's go.
Oh, master, what about me?
The file cabinet.
Huh?
Blink it back.
Blink it back.
Yes.
Twenty, 40, 60, 80, You want me to sell you this rare and beautiful antique that my mother worked and slaved to buy me for only a hundred bucks?
Boy, talk about taking advantage of a little kid who's a member of a minority group.
Please, little boy.
It is very, very important.
How about a hundred dollars and an eight-by-10 picture of me in a space capsule?
Oh, lovely.
Okay um, a hundred and 10 dollars, huh?
Is that all a mother's dream means to you?
Can you believe that?
Okay, 120, huh?
Come on, look at the paint job.
Look at the chassis.
All 88 keys in perfect condition.
Whoa, no.
Ah, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
My fault.
My fault.
I'm sorry about your hand.
Don't be mad.
Little boy, be honest.
You do not really wish to play the piano, do you?
No, but that isn't going to affect the price.
Now, if it was a trumpet, your anxious friends wouldn't have a chance.
Oh.
A trumpet?
Yeah.
That's what I really want to play, but my mother says it pushes your teeth in.
That's all you got?
Yeah.
And that leaves me flat.
Listen, about pushing his teeth in, maybe we could give him a Oh, yeah, you're right.
Okay, 150 bucks.
That's ab-absolutely rock bottom.
And a beautiful golden trumpet.
Oh-ho.
Wow.
Wow, mm-hm.
Great technique, but no heart.
Okay.
All set.
Uh, is the piano okay?
Oh, yes, master.
It is right here in my purse.
Huh?
Oh, cute.
It's a baby spinet.
Oh, Jeannie, you better get this bill of sale back to Dr. Bellow's files.
Oh, yes, master.
Immediately.
Oh, and now meet me in New York at Symphony Hall, my dressing room, in exactly, uh, three hours.
Let's synchronize watches.
Major Nelson, Major Healey.
The plane's waiting!
You get out.
Well, maestro, all ready?
Yeah, he can't wait to get to the big city.
Are you going too, sir?
Well, of course.
I wouldn't miss Major Nelson's New York debut for the world.
Come on, hurry up.
Yeah.
Well, uh Oh.
Here, you carry this.
It's good for the fingers.
Yes, General Schaeffer, I'm coming.
Help!
Master, let me out, master.
Oh, look at the time.
Where is she, Roger?
It's almost 8:30.
Well, you know how women are.
They're always late.
Yeah.
Well, she's got the piano.
She has the piano.
Well, she probably put it somewhere on stage and is waiting in the audience.
What is that thing you're working on, anyway?
A bomb.
A bomb?
A bomb?
!
Well, it's not exactly a bomb.
It's kind of a self-destruct mechanism.
I'm gonna put it in the piano.
You're gonna What are you talking about, Roger?
Well, you said this, uh You wanted this to be your last concert?
Yeah.
Well, I'll tell you what.
When you finish your last number, you take this little switch here.
See?
And you switch it on and it starts ticking.
See?
And in exactly 45 seconds:  No No more magic piano.
Roger, that's really beautiful.
I know.
Ha-ha.
Brilliant.
Will you get out on stage and see if that piano is there?
You know, sometimes I think you don't appreciate me.
Roger, please.
Go on, will you.
Get out there.
All right, I'm going, I'm going.
I made the bomb and you want me to get out.
JEANNIE : Please, someone let me out.
My master needs me.
Oh, I had better do it myself.
Master?
Whoo-hoo, master.
This way.
This way.
Is the piano all right?
Yes.
Yes.
Don't worry, major.
It's all ready.
Oh.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Back.
Back.
No, no.
No, no.
The piano isn't here yet.
I know that.
What am I gonna do?
Stall, stall.
Stall?
!
What do you mean?
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Please, please.
Would you take the piano.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
Not here.
My dressing room.
Magic tricks?
At Symphony Hall?
That's the piano from the recreation hall.
Where did he get that?
I can't imagine.
I traded it in this morning.
Bravo!
Bravo!
Genius.
Why, he played "The Minute Waltz" in 34 seconds flat.
Oh, no.
More.
More.
Encore, encore, encore.
More, more.
I suppose the old piano just couldn't take it.
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
I got it.
I got it.
Yeah.
Oh.
What, Major Healey?
Tell me, quick.
I got it.
Why don't you give him a briefcase?
Huh?
The one he's got is falling apart.
Major Healey, my master and I are celebrating five years together as master and genie.
This This gift must be something special.
Yeah, something special.
Something special.
Hey, if you want to give him the kind of present a wife would give him, give him a tie.
Is that what wives usually give husbands?
All the time.
Oh, well, all right.
What?
What's that?
A Thai from Thailand.
I wonder if I should have him gift-wrapped.
Just what Tony needed: A half a set of Siamese twins.
That's great.
Not Not a foreign Thai.
A foreign hand tie.
Oh, that kind of a tie.
Yes.
Oh!
Hey.
What was that?
Oh, major.
Oh, oh, I am sorry.
You will not be needed.
Heh.
Well It's for you.
Oh.
Uncle Sully!
My little Jeannie.
Will you?
Will you let me down?
You know, guys, heh, I'm with her.
Oh, Uncle Sully, you have not changed a bit.
Oh, a few last hairs and a little plumper, but you, my dove, you have blossomed into a woman.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Oh, I am sorry.
This is my very dear friend, Major Healey.
Major, this is my granduncle Suleiman, maharajah of Basenji.
Oh, granduncle, yes.
Maharajah, no.
I have abdicated.
You, my niece, will be the new queen of Basenji.
Oh, oh.
Oh, no.
No.
Salaam to the new queen.
Oh, uncle, no.
I could not.
Uh, Your Majesty, as your first official act, would you mind getting me down from here?
Oh!
Thank you, uncle.
Oh, Major Healey, I have the most marvelous idea.
I know just what to give my master for our anniversary.
What?
A country.
Oh, my master, the king.
Now, if Major Nelson is to be maharajah of Basenji, we must investigate him thoroughly.
So we will wait.
Sit down.
Now, Major Nelson, I want you to understand that this assignment is just as important to the program as your last moon flight.
Well, isn't there someone else, sir?
I-I'm not very well versed in diplomatic protocol.
I'm apt to agree with you, major, but that's not the point.
The State Department promised the ambassador of Kasha that an astronaut would show him and his party around the base.
Kasha?
Hmm.
Yes.
Kasha has the only deposits of refineable phinkilium, a rare metal that we must have for the propulsion system of the Saturn 12.
Um, exactly where is Kasha, sir?
Uh, it's in the Mideast.
Uh, it shares borders with Russia, Afghanistan and an insignificant little emirate called, uh, uh, Basenji.
Oh, yes, here.
Now, your job, Major Nelson  Your Majesty.
Hi, Roge.
What'd you call me?
Oh, uh, nothing, Your Highness.
Well, what are you talking about, Roge?
Not me.
Not Roge.
Mum's the word.
When I keep a secret, I really keep a secret.
See?
Oh.
Oh!
Well, you must be Major Anthony Nelson?
Yes.
Salaam!
Oh, local custom, huh?
Salaam!
Now, Major No.
Arise.
The Most High kneels to no one.
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Well, thank you.
You know, major, I have had good reports of you.
But, uh, my country is very dear to my heart.
So before I make this final decision, I must investigate you thoroughly.
I understand, sir.
I'll make myself at your disposal.
Major Nelson, I just wondered Oh, they're here, I see.
Yes.
Salaam!
I beg your pardon.
Uh, it's a local custom, sir.
He wants you to kneel.
In Cocoa Beach?
Please, sir.
Oh, of course.
Not to me, to him.
You want me to salaam to Major Nelson?
Remember the phinkilium, sir.
Oh You may rise, sir.
Well, I see that you're all getting along quite swimmingly, so I'll I'll just report to the general, uh, that you're here.
Uh, gentlemen.
Oh, uh Uh, effendi.
A, uh Effendi.
Well, slow down, doctor.
The The ambassador from Kasha isn't supposed to be here until late this afternoon.
Sir, I have just come from Major Nelson's office, where I saw them with my own eyes.
They They made me salaam to Major Nelson.
Salaam?
To To Major Nelson?
Yes, sir.
In the interest of the phinkilium, I thought it was best to humor them.
Ah, come along, doctor.
I'd like to meet this ambassador from Kasha.
Just step in this way please, gentlemen.
Now, in this room we simulate conditions of inner and outer space.
And I think you'll find this room particularly interesting.
It's the wind tunnel.
Uh, in this room we test air draft.
Oh, well, thank you.
Uh, now, this generates heat as well as wind velocities up to 2000 miles per hour.
Now, if you'll look at those giant blades in the back, that's what gives it Uh, please feel free to look around and just enjoy yourself.
Take all the time you want.
Hi, Tony.
Hi, Roge.
Uncle Sull Are you really going through with this thing?
I have to.
It's in the national interest.
Oh, well, if you need any help, I'll be glad to give you a hand.
Thanks, Roge.
Uh, you're probably having your own harem and, uh, you could maybe get me one and we can double-date.
Harem?
What are you talking about?
Swell.
Now that you're the maharajah, you're gonna forget about your old buddies?
I don't know what's going through your head, but the only reason I'm doing this is because NASA wants the mineral rights to the phinkilium.
What did you say?
Uh, uh, the phinkilium, sir.
I was, uh, explaining to my colleague that the major resource of Kasha is phinkilium.
And you are a supporter of Kasha?
Yes, sir.
We all are.
Tony, this-those guys Roge, we have to reassure 'em.
Uh, sir, Your Excellency, written across my heart, in letters of affection and respect, is the word Kasha.
Traitor!
Vile offspring of a snake!
Now Now, wait Wait, sir.
Don't get excited, please.
Oh Well, you can forget about the harem girls.
He blinked.
You blinked.
He blinked!
Of course I blinked.
Of course he blinks.
He's Jeannie's granduncle.
It runs in the family.
What?
You have the colossal effrontery to tell me Me, Suleiman, that you are a partisan of Kasha, our hated and hereditary enemy?
Uh, sir, if you'll just let me explain, I Take him.
Hey, let's negotiate!
The only thing you'll be able to negotiate is whether I turn you into a galley slave or a keeper of the camel.
Jeannie!
Where is Major Nelson?
Major Nelson?
Oh, Major Nelson.
Oh, he's, uh He's not here.
Well, I asked you to have him wait.
Oh, I asked him.
I asked him, sir.
He had to go.
He said he had to go.
It was urgent.
With the Kashese ambassador, right?
Uh, a plump fellow with two huge ones?
I-in, uh, turbans and robes?
Well, I didn't see any Kashese, uh, ambassador.
But he was with them.
TONY : Jeannie!
What was that?
What was that?
What was that?
Well, they're testing the wind tunnel.
Nonsense.
That was a human voice.
Excuse me, major.
Don't go in there, sir.
Sir, sir.
Oh, uh, sir, have you noticed that Dr. Bellows has been acting rather strange lately?
I saw him.
I saw him!
He was chained to a huge plank over his shoulders, and those men in the turbans and the robes, they were standing over him.
And then, all of a sudden, that plump one folded his arms, and they all disappeared.
But it's true.
I saw it.
Major, in answer to your previous question, I'd say you were guilty of a gross understatement.
Come along, doctor.
Now, Major Healey, find Major Nelson and ask him to come to my office.
Yes, sir.
Major Healey It's all right.
General, I tell you As soon as he finishes taking care of the camels.
One, two.
One, two.
One, two.
Two, three.
One, two, three.
Oh Oh, it is terrible.
It's true.
What have I done?
Shh.
Quiet!
I don't wanna miss a beat.
It fouls up the other guys.
Oh, it's terrible.
Oh, it's great.
Great.
An all-expense-paid vacation, as an anniversary present, as a galley slave.
Do not worry, master.
I will rescue you.
Yeah, just don't talk about it, do it.
Would you please blink me home?
Oh, I want to, master, more than anything in the whole world.
Yeah?
But, uh, it is not that easy.
You What's so tough about a blink?
Well, you see, master, blinking would not do any good.
You see, Uncle Sully put you here, and besides being a genie, he's also a maharajah and his blink takes precedence over mine.
Oh.
See, I don't want a lecture on the ranking of genies.
Just get me home, please.
Oh, yes, master.
Instantly.
Yeah I will, uh I will talk to Uncle Sully.
Good.
Good.
Yes.
Oh, please, Uncle Sully.
Please.
He is my master and I love him.
By punishing him, you are punishing me.
You, my dove?
Never.
Besides, you don't need him anymore.
As soon as I abdicate, you will be the new queen of Basenji.
I do not wish to be queen of Basenji if I must lose my master.
You love him that much?
Does he also return your love?
Well Yeah.
Yes, yes.
He He does.
Yes.
All right.
I am about to make an executive decision.
I will release him.
Oh, thank you, Uncle Mwah!
Oh!
On two conditions: First, that he avenge the honor of Basenji for his traitorous support of Kasha.
Oh, I'm sure he will do that.
And second, that he marry you.
Oh, I'm not so sure he will do that.
Stroke, you traitorous oxen, stroke!
Water!
Thanks.
Dr. Bellows Yes?
Do you still insist that you saw Major Nelson with the ambassador from Kasha?
Well, o-of course, general.
Two huge guards in turbans and robes.
Brace yourself, doctor.
Would you come in, please.
This is Dr. Bellows.
He's had a slight accident.
Dr. Bellows, this is His Excellency, the ambassador from Kasha, the emir Hamid Al Yachman.
This is ridiculous.
I can't agree to those conditions.
Oh, well, of course, master.
I understand if you do not wish to marry me.
I didn't say I did not wish to marry you, but I will not be intimidated.
Master What?
I think it'd be better if you got down on your knees as if you were proposing to me.
I'm not gonna get down on my knees to anybody.
One, two, three, stroke.
One, two, three, stroke.
All right.
This is blackmail.
Oh, master, you know I would not put you in this position if it were not necessary.
Yeah.
But as long as you're down there do you love me just a little bit?
Yes, I love you very much!
Oh, Uncle Sully, he says all right!
I did not say, "All right".
Well, I know that and you know that, but Uncle Sully does not know that.
Wait a minute.
What about the other condition?
How am I g-going to avenge the honor of Basenji?
Oh, master, do not worry about that.
It will probably be something relatively easy to do.
Yeah Wait!
Tony.
Oh, uh, excuse me, your most high.
This'll just take a second.
Oh, hi, Tony.
Uh, did you have a rough cruise?
Oh, listen, listen.
Thanks.
General Schaeffer wants to see you.
He wants you to escort the ambassador of Kasha.
What?
!
Roger!
What'd I say?
Quiet, slow-witted one.
Oh, you have just supplied the means for Major Nelson to satisfy the first condition.
Tony?
Tony.
What?
Wait, wait.
I got something for you.
Oh, careful.
What is that, Roger?
I've thrown this thing away three times.
Why do you keep picking it up?
Tony, you don't want to be a galley slave.
Besides, the ambassador's a little guy.
I'll give him the tour and that'll be the end of it.
Give him the tour.
Come on.
Yeah, give him the tour.
Oh, it will be a pleasure to watch Major Nelson get rid of him.
Perfect.
Ah!
His Excellency, the ambassador from Kasha, the emir Hamid Al Yachman.
It's a great honor to meet you, sir.
Ptooey.
The honor is mine.
Hey!
Oh!
Oh, uh, a-and also an honor to present you with this ceremonial letter opener in honor o-of your visit, Your Honor.
Heh-heh.
Well, that's That's very thoughtful of you, major.
Isn't it, doctor?
Yes, uh, very thoughtful.
Now, uh, gentlemen, the base is yours.
If you need anything, just don't hesitate to call.
General, about that letter opener.
Come, doctor.
Uh, we'll We'll start off with the Simulated Space Environmental lab, sir.
Uh, right this way.
Roger.
"Made in Basenji"?
Ptooey!
Right this way, sir.
It is dangerous in here.
Now, you'll notice, sir, that this is a very small room.
However, with our various devices, we're able to simulate the vastness of outer space.
Now I'd like to draw your attention to the wind tunnel.
No, no.
I beg of you.
I I am an honored guest.
Well, it's just a pointer.
I was just pointing with it.
You are trying to kill me.
Sir, if you'll just wait a minute.
When some man with a scimitar has it pointed at your throat, there is nothing to wait for!
Now, this is what I call fun.
Heh-heh.
Wait a minute, sir.
If you touch me, it means war.
I have diplomatic immunity.
Please get up, sir.
I I can explain everything.
Really, I can.
Can I listen?
Now for the finishing touch.
Psst.
Psst.
Psst.
Psst.
Figured you'd be around here someplace.
Give him this.
Give it to him.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Stay there.
Please, please, please!
No, no, no.
Sir?
Sir, uh, take this.
This will soothe your nerves.
Oh.
Sorry, sir.
Where'd you get it?
Good idea.
From Uncle Sully in the garbage can.
Huh?
I'm I'm sorry I had to do that.
What's the matter?
Ah!
The foot, the foot.
You assassin!
Assassin?
!
Well, gentlemen, how are things going?
So, general, this is the way you treat an honored guest.
You turn him over to that murderous maniac.
He tried to stab me.
To slit my throat.
To throw me into a den of ferocious tigers.
To poison me with acid.
A den of tigers?
In the Space Environment lab?
Your Excellency, please No more, no more.
Kasha is going to sever diplomatic relations with the United States.
We are going to sell our phinkilium to To Albania!
S-stop him, doctor!
Stop him!
Yes, general.
Sir, if you'd just Atten-hut!
You will explain nothing.
In the last 24 hours, you have not only driven Dr. Bellows to the point of a nervous breakdown, but you have muffed an assignment that is vital to the future of the space program.
Permission to speak, sir.
Permission to speak?
!
Nelson, you'll be lucky if you get permission to stay in the Air Force.
And get some decent shoes.
Well, you've always got your job as a galley slave.
Is that lunatic still in the g-garbage can?
Yeah.
Yeah?
What is it?
What is it?
What is it?
Shh.
Gotcha!
Now, you listen to me, maharajah of Basenji.
You and your two clowns better stay out of my life or you're gonna spend your life in a NASA garbage can.
Yeah.
And And none of your cockeyed conditions.
I'm Jeannie's master and that's the way it's gonna stay.
You understand?
I'm sick and tired of her and her magical nincompoops f-fouling up my life.
I wouldn't marry her if she were the last genie on Earth!
That's telling him, Tony.
Yeah.
Goodbye, master forever.
Just calm down.
Everything's gonna be all right.
She'll probably be waiting for you in her bottle.
She said she was gonna leave a million times.
And will you calm down?
Hold that, will you.
What What are you looking for?
My keys.
Oh.
Your keys.
Boy, you're in bad shape.
Listen, Roger, what did I?
I completely lost my temper.
You think she'll ever forgive me?
Huh?
I don't know, but I don't want to be around if she doesn't.
Oh.
Oh, those are the car keys.
Here Here's the house keys.
Look, just Just Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Oh, I didn't meant it.
Jeannie, he didn't mean it.
Even if he did, he's the one who said it, not me.
I didn't do it.
This is no time to joke.
She might really be gone.
It wasn't me.
Oh, thank heavens, here's the bottle.
Here, give me those.
Jeannie, listen.
I'm I'm really sorry for what I said.
I I didn't mean it at all.
What happened was that I I was pretty angry at your uncle, and Ah, I hope you'll forgive me.
Maybe she didn't hear you.
Jeannie, come on out.
I-I brought you some flowers.
There's nothing in there.
What?
And she left me a note.
What's the matter?
You read it.
Well, I think she really left you this time.
Well, I think she really left you this time.
I think she really left you this time.
I think she really left you this time.
I think she really left you this time.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
The unsuspecting Major Anthony Nelson was assigned the task of escorting the ambassador from the tiny Middle Eastern kingdom of Kasha through the NASA complex.
Kasha has the only known deposits of refinable phinkilium, needed for the NASA propulsion systems.
The assignment would have been routine, except Jeannie's uncle, ruler of the neighboring kingdom of Basenji, chose this moment to arrive at the Nelson house to announce that he was giving up his throne in favor of Jeannie.
Major Healey has been helping Jeannie decide what to give Major Nelson for his fifth anniversary as her master.
Her uncle's arrival decided her.
She would give her master a country.
But when she asked Major Nelson to marry her and become the new sultan, he made the mistake of saying that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last genie on Earth.
And that is when his trouble began.
Goodbye, master.
Forever.
Jeannie?
Jeannie!
Uh, I didn't mean it.
Jeannie, he didn't mean it.
Even if he did, he's the one who said it, not me.
I didn't do it.
This is no time to joke.
She might really be gone.
Wasn't me.
Oh, thank heavens.
Here's the bottle.
Give me those.
Uh, Jeannie.
Listen, I'm I'm really sorry for what I said.
I I didn't mean it at all.
I What happened was, that I I was pretty angry at your uncle and I hope you'll forgive me.
Maybe she didn't hear you.
Uh.
Jeannie, come on out.
I I brought you some flowers.
There's nothing in there.
Oh, yeah.
And she left me a note.
What's that?
You read it.
Well, I'm afraid she's really left you this time.
I can't believe it.
Well, uh, think of the bright side of You're a You're a free man now.
Yeah, sure.
Jeannie won't be around to make any more trouble for me, that's for sure.
And you don't have to make up any of those wild stories for Dr. Bellows.
Yeah.
I don't have to think up those cockeyed explanations for all the nutty things she used to do.
Yeah.
From now on you're just an average, everyday astronaut.
Huh?
Average, everyday astronaut.
Yeah, that's right.
I'm a free man, huh?
Yeah!
What am I worried about?
I feel like a A big weight's been lifted off my shoulders.
Oh Thanks, Roge.
That's the spirit.
That's the That's the spirit.
Oh.
You're really taking this like a man.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Where are you?
Jeannie.
What are you doing?
Huh?
Well, I I just wanted to make sure that she didn't, uh, ch-change bottles, you know.
I thought you were glad to get rid of her.
Yeah, well, I am.
I I just wanted to be sure she's not here before we celebrate, you know?
Yeah, well, maybe we'd better look around before we start whooping it up.
Yeah, you look around, huh?
I'll check the living room.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Now, come on.
Oh.
Not in there either.
Uh.
Major Nelson.
Major, are you here?
Roger!
Roger!
Hey, Roger, would you help me get this bottle off my finger?
Oh.
Colonel Bellows.
What happened to Tony?
He seems to have knocked himself out with a pop bottle.
I have terrible news.
Major Nelson has been dropped from the astronaut program.
Jeannie.
Jeannie  The general is very determined, major.
Frankly, I don't think it'll do much good, but I'll stand by you.
I'll stand by you too, Tony, till the end.
Uh, sir, whatever happened was an accident.
See, it was not my fault.
I I'd like a chance to apologize.
Major Nelson, he insists that you tried to stab him with a dagger, slit his throat with a scimitar, uh, throw him into a den of tigers, and poison him with a glass of acid.
Now, somehow I don't think an apology would be sufficient.
A den of tigers?
Really, sir.
I know, major.
I know.
But you can see the position this puts me in.
We need that phinkilium desperately for our propulsion systems.
And when the Pentagon hears that we've lost it well somebody's head's got to roll.
Oh, but general, Major Nelson is one of our finest officers.
I know, doctor.
But it's either his head or mine.
That's very nice of you, sir.
You can always get a job with an aircraft company.
Healey when that's the choice he loses.
Oh.
Well, I did my best, old buddy.
I Colonel.
General.
Hold it, Healey.
You're in this too.
And as the old saying goes, two heads are better than one.
Oh, thanks a lot, old buddy.
There's nothing I wanted more than six months' duty in the Aleutian Islands.
Don't blame me, Roge.
Jeannie got you into this.
Why isn't she up here tracking satellites, instead of me?
If we're gonna get along, don't mention Jeannie's name again.
ROGER : I didn't bring it up.
You did.
Don't shake your fist at me.
Who's shaking his fist?
I can't stop shivering.
Ooh.
Oh Oh Oh  You are still mooning about that astronaut.
Ooh.
Oh, I am not mooning.
He does not care for me anyway.
Forget all about him.
Soon you will have a new master, and right here in Basenji.
N-now, let's discuss the list of suitors.
Hm.
Tsk.
How do I choose?
Oh, it It is very ingenious.
It is written that he who wishes to marry into the royal family of Basenji must first answer the riddle of the box.
Well.
Very well, uncle.
I have agreed that I shall marry, so I suppose it does not matter how my husband is chosen.
I shall be ready when the time comes.
Good afternoon, oh, future queen.
Oh.
What's the matter with the future queen?
She's still attached to her former master.
Well, now, ahem, I want you to inform all of the suitors that the day of the riddle will be in exactly one week.
And be sure and tell 'em the rules.
He who is, uh, successful in answering the riddle of the box will marry Jeannie.
And those that lose will be, uh Be, uh beheaded.
Explorer 8 disappeared from the screen at precisely 21:08.
That's 2-1-0-8.
Right on beacon.
Mail call.
This is Nelson, over and out.
Whoa.
Whoa, cold.
Oh!
Oh.
Oh, cold.
I wish you'd take your snowshoes off before you come into the igloo, huh?
They are off.
My feet are swollen.
Oh, by the way, uh, Enik's got a friend for you.
Enik?
Who's Enik?
Oh, it's a little Eskimo girl I met down at the mail drop.
Hot stuff, relatively speaking.
Heh.
Well, Roge, you know we're not supposed to fool around with Eskimo girls.
I know, but I've got no choice.
Did you ever try to kiss a walrus?
Huh?
Here we go.
Uh, Dolly.
That's for me.
Helen, that's for me.
Gwendolyn, that's for me.
Dr. Bellows.
That's for you.
Do we stay here?
Oh, mail.
Oh, mwah, mwah, mwah.
Oh.
Helen, Helen.
Hey, Roge!
We've been reprieved!
You're kidding.
Oh.
You're kidding.
Listen to this.
"Major Anthony Nelson" Blah, blah, blah, blah Oh, "Since NASA has been able to get phinkilium "from an unexpected source, "I have persuaded General Schaeffer to reinstate you both.
"You have been assigned to the Apollo 14 project.
"Proceed to Cocoa Beach now.
Best, Alfred Bellows".
Alfred Bellows!
Oh!
Hello, Dolly.
Oh Oh, listen.
I gotta Listen What's the matter with you?
Why aren't you jumping around?
I can't.
You're standing on my snowshoes.
Oh.
Oh.
Hey, wait a minute.
Wait.
Here's something else.
What's the matter?
Oh, no.
What's the matter?
What does it say, "cancel the previous message"?
"The tiny kingdom of Basenji "will receive a" "A new monarch on Wednesday "when the maharani, Jeannie the First, "will choose a husband and be crowned on the same day in an ancient Middle Eastern ceremony".
Roge Jeannie's getting married.
Well, what's the matter with that?
You said you never wanted to see her again anyway.
And you believed me?
I haven't been able to get her out of my thoughts since we've been here.
Three whole weeks.
I I dream of her every night.
I'm in love with her.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Hey That's Wednesday.
Wednesday.
Wait a minute.
By the time you get down to Cocoa Beach and ask Schaeffer's permission, it'll be too late.
I'm not going to Cocoa Beach.
I'm going to Basenji.
Basenji?
You wanted to see me, general.
Oh, yes.
It's about, uh, Nelson and Healey.
I see that you've okayed their assignment to the top position in the Apollo 14 project.
If you're concerned about their health, sir, I'm sure that three weeks in the Arctic can only have toughened them.
No, it's not that.
It's It's Nelson's stability and dependability.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, sir.
I'm sure he's learned his lesson.
Well, all right.
We'll see.
When will he be back?
Well, I just received word from the air base in the Aleutians.
Uh, they're ready to take off immediately.
That should, uh, bring them back about, uh, oh, noon tomorrow.
Word of caution, doctor.
If I don't find Nelson stable and dependable Oh, he will be, sir.
Absolutely dependable.
I guarantee it.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Wait.
Where are you going?
We're routed for Cocoa Beach.
Roger, this plane's going to Basenji International Airport.
You don't have to come.
She's my Jeannie.
Are you kid?
We've just been reinstated.
If you do this, we're gonna get kicked out for sure.
Well, I can't help it, Roger.
I'm in love.
Oh, goodbye, Dolly.
Goodbye, Gwendolyn.
Goodbye, Helen.
Goodbye, Tony.
Goodbye, Roger.
Goodbye, world.
Boy, I'm running out of goodbyes.
Now, Major Nelson, your first mass-land checkpoint will be Juneau.
Course one-seven-oh vector.
Oh, Major Nelson, you're headed the wrong way.
Correct to one-seven-oh vector.
Major Nelson?
You're headed for Russia.
Russia?
Russia?
Oh, I Sir, I'm sure there must be some mistake.
Yes, doctor, that's possible.
And you better hope it's true, because if that plane lands in Russia, I'll have you court-martialed.
Come on, baby.
Get me to the mosque on time.
Hello, firing squad.
Hello, anybody.
Get me out of here.
Please I gotta    People of Basenji, today is the day of the riddle.
Where are all the?
Where are all the suitors?
There are none.
When they learned the rules, nobody wanted to play.
Oh.
This is a disaster.
We must find Jeannie a new master.
How we gonna pay for all this crepe paper?
I have it.
You shall marry Jeannie.
Me?
Ah.
Uncle Sule.
Who is that?
Oh, that is only Osman, my child.
You know, due to our austerity program, besides being secretary of the state, why, he is also the royal executioner.
Executioner?
What for?
Well, for the losers, naturally.
You know, I mean, if If they don't guess the riddle right, why, they're instantly beheaded.
Oh, uncle, that is horrible.
I could not possibly do that.
Uh, not you.
Uh, Osman.
You know, one zumph and it's all over.
Oh!
Oh, that is terrible.
I refuse.
Oh, now, now, now.
Now, don't worry, my dear.
I The occasion may not even arise.
Suitors for the hand of Queen Jeannie step forward and announce yourself.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I demand the right to see the queen.
I demand the right to call a cop.
Master.
W-what?
What is the meaning of this?
You dare invade the imperial throne room on the day of the riddle.
Jeannie, I want to talk to you.
Silence!
You have no claim on her.
You are not her master any longer.
Then I demand the right to ask for her hand in marriage.
Marriage?
But But master, you You said that I know what I said, Jeannie.
And I must have been out of my mind.
I can't live without you.
I love you.
And I want you to be my wife.
Oh   Master.
Oh, master.
Oh.
Oh, no.
No, no, no, master.
I Uncle Sule, I I have changed my mind.
I do not wish to marry my master.
Send him home.
Huh.
Send them both home.
Oh, just Just Just a minute, my dear.
On second thought, I will allow your foreign master to enter the competition.
I mean, after all, the only qualification is that he agree to abide by our rules.
Now, you do agree to abide by our little rules, don't you?
Oh, yes, yes.
Uh, anything you say, Your Excellency.
You just tell me what to do.
Master, you do not understand.
No.
Hm?
Hi.
Oh, uh, what's that thing for?
Oh, uh, just casual interest.
Carry on.
Ah.
Tony, I think you better give this thing some thought.
Silence!
Now, uh, advance to the riddle box.
And you, major, shall have the honor of going first.
Oh, thank you.
Oh, don't mention it.
Uncle Sule, I will not allow it.
I do not wish my master to compete.
Oh, uh, unfortunately, my dove, it is completely out of my hands.
It is written that all who wish to guess the riddle of the box may have the chance.
Uh, you mean all I have to do is tell you what's in the box?
Childishly simple, isn't it?
Yeah.
Ask him what happens if you are wrong.
Well, o-of course, there There is a small penalty.
I told you we should have stayed in the igloo.
Guess.
Uh Well, yes, I I'm thinking.
Um Guess.
Animal, vegetable or mineral?
Your time is up.
Guess!
An ingot of phinkilium.
What did you say?
An ingot of phinkilium.

But now that I have my master back, I no longer wish to be Queen of Basenji.
I will ride off.
And goodbye, uncle.
Jeannie?
Oh.

I'll take care of this immediately.

{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Congratulations, Major Nelson.
I just got the word.
Washington has approved your nomination as the senior officer on the Lunar Landing Project.
Oh, yes, yes.
Thank you very much, sir.
Of course it won't be official until General Whetherby approves you.
Uh, General Whetherby, sir?
Yes, Pentagon liaison.
He's arriving today.
Ah.
Oh, but don't worry.
The job is yours.
Unless of course you foul things up by doing something weird.
Heh.
Weird?
Me, sir?
Please, Major Nelson.
Weird is the mildest word I can think of to describe some of the things you've done.
Although I must admit that, uh, things have been pretty quiet since you got engaged.
Well, getting engaged does quiet a man down, sir.
Well, in your case, it was long overdue.
Mmm.
Oh, that reminds me, uh, your charming fiancÃ©e is having lunch with Amanda today.
Oh.
Uh, Jeannie's having l-lunch with Amanda, sir?
Where?
Where would that be, sir?
At our house.
What's the matter with you, major?
You look positively gray.
You know, I want to really get to know you.
Well, how nice.
Yes.
Oh!
Oh, this Florida sunshine.
Honestly, it is just turning my skin to leather.
Really?
Oh, yes.
I've tried everything, and nothing seems to work.
What do you use?
Oh, just regular genie cream.
Genie cream?
No, I've never tried that.
Hello, Helen.
Well, I-it is a special formula.
Oh.
Perhaps I have some here with me.
I think you will find this will help.
And you may keep it.
Oh, thank you, Je Oh, I'm going to try it right away.
Oh, once in the morning is all you need.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Jeannie.
Tha Oh, for goodness  Mmm.
Mmm.
Feels better already.
Mmm.
Now, about that gift.
Well, general, Major Nelson's not a kid.
He, um, thinks creatively, but he's very mature.
He is, huh?
Um You'll, uh, see when you meet him.
Old for his age, wise and tough.
Married man, is he?
Engaged.
A tough, wise, old, engaged man.
Huh?
Oh, no, no, I wasn't worried.
I was just wondering what Mrs. Bellows meant when she said Oh, oh, I see.
You gave her a little jar of face cream, huh?
Well, that's sweet.
Okay, darling.
I'll I'll talk to you later.
Bye.
Hello, major.
Hello.
Miss.
Oh, oh, make my wildest dreams come true.
Tell me you're looking for me.
Oh, Major Healey.
You know my name.
You're looking for me.
You're beautiful.
I mean, you really are beautiful.
Oh, well, thank you.
If you're not doing anything tonight, maybe we could get married.
Oh, Major Healey, you're a bit strange most of the time, but today!
Strange?
It's fate.
A beautiful girl comes walking down Major Healey.
You're the most Wait.
Oh!
Oh, miss.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Tony, I just met a girl.
You can't I just met the girl and I'm in love with her.
Again?
Oh, not again.
This girl makes Raquel Welch look like Everett Dirksen?
Yeah.
How'd you know?
You used that last week.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
No, no, I mean, this girl is beautiful.
She's a little young for me.
Yeah.
Well, aren't they all?
What's her name?
Oh, her name.
Well, she's luscious, she's beautiful, she's young.
Her name is, uh, Amanda Bellows?
Uh, Roger, really.
This is serious.
I I got to finish this report.
No, I mean it.
I saw this girl in the hallway, and she dropped this badge.
Are you sure?
I'm sure.
I've never been wrong about women.
What do you think it means?
It means we better find the girl of your dreams.
I think we've got an impostor here.
No.
This girl's too pretty.
She can't be an impostor.
Was she out this?
Out this way.
Which way'd she go?
Down there.
Tony.
Yeah.
Is that her?
Yeah.
Don't worry about it.
It was my goof.
I'll do the interrogation.
No, no, no.
Excuse me, miss.
My name's Anthony Nelson.
I, uh I understand you were wearing this.
Would you tell me where you got it?
Very funny, Major Nelson.
Now would someone let me in on the joke?
Whoever she's working for knows how to pick 'em.
She sure sounds like Mrs. Bellows.
I am Mrs. Bellows!
Roger, I have a sick feeling.
Me too.
I think the girl I'm in love with is a spy.
Huh?
Don't worry, darling.
I'll get you the best lawyers.
I'll stick by you to the end.
Major Nelson, get him off me!
Roger, take your hands off of her.
Uh, could you tell me where you were about an hour ago?
Well, having lunch with your fiancÃ©e.
You know that.
You called right after she left.
Di Uh Did she give you anything?
Well, yes.
A jar of face cream.
Why?
Roger, take your hands off Mrs. Bellows.
What would I want with Mrs. Bellows?
I'm in love with her.
Oh!
Roger, this is Mrs. Bellows.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Bellows.
This is Jeannie gave her some face cream.
You understand?
Face cream!
Face cream?
Oh, I'm not sure, but I I think I'm heartbroken.
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about this, Mrs. Bellows.
Not half as sorry as you're going to be when my husband hears about this!
Jeannie, listen to me.
I don't have time to answer questions.
You get over here just as soon as you can.
Ah!
Nelson!
Here.
Oh, Alfred!
Help!
Major Healey, were you leaning on that door?
No, sir.
I was just leaving.
What's going on here?
Major Nelson.
Ah!
No.
Ah.
Mmm.
I can explain all this, sir.
Somehow.
That's the mature, stable, engaged man you recommended?
Stand aside.
I knew something weird would happen.
I'm beginning to wonder about your maturity, doctor.
Hold on.
Uh, general.
I just wanted to tell you that Good afternoon, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, uh, I wouldn't come in here if I were you.
Why not?
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Oh, hello.
Heh.
Oh, what is in the closet, Major Healey?
Oh, I I can't watch this.
Dr. Bellows, I can explain.
Dr. Bellows Oh!
Oh!
No!
It's not Oh, Anthony!
How could you?
See, I can explain this.
I can explain this.
I can expl Wait, Jeannie!
Oh, Mrs. Bellows, I'm so sorry.
Oh.
Darling, oh, I love you.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Mrs. Bellows, wait a second!
Is it something I said?
Mrs. Bellows?
Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Stop!
This whole thing was your fault anyway.
My fault?
Yes.
Oh!
Oh, master Now Now Now Shh!
Don't.
Oh, oh, pardon me, sir.
You donated to the Serviceman's Pension Plan?
No No, I haven't.
Jeannie, look, look.
Don't blink, don't blink!
Oh, I can't help it, sir.
See, I have this astigmatism.
You have no reason to be mad.
Where are you?
Oh, I'm not mad.
I'm not.
Sometimes my enthusiasm gets in the way and make people think it's anger.
And it's really not anger at all.
But, general, you don't understand.
That was not the Major Nelson I know.
And you call that That cloakroom Casanova mature?
Well, he is.
I mean, he was.
But you must understand.
I would never recommend a man capable of that kind of behavior.
Oh.
Oh, Alfred.
Oh!
Oh, you wouldn't, huh?
Oh!
Young woman, if you don't mind Well, what's the matter?
Aren't you even going to ask me what I was doing in that closet?
Well, it was quite evident, uh, Miss, uh Oh, now you're going to pretend you don't know me.
Well, I'm sorry, miss, but I I really don't.
Oh.
I hope I wake up soon.
I I I hate this dream!
I suppose you're going to tell me you've never seen that, uh, busy young beauty before.
That's exactly what I'm going to say.
But, uh, it seems I I've heard that voice before.
She sounds exactly like my wife.
Oh, yes.
That's always the way it is.
They run away from their wives and then they find another one exactly the same.
Me?
Shame on you Bellows.
Good heavens.
You old goat.
I didn't know you had it in you.
But jumping cannonballs, man, not in public!
But I checked the parking lot.
Mrs. Bellows must've gone home.
Okay.
Uh, get over to the house and keep her from looking in mirrors until Jeannie straightens this out.
Right, right.
And, Roger.
Yeah?
Remember, try to find the cream.
Right.
Yeah?
Roger.
Try to remember it's Mrs. Bellows.
Roger!
Yeah Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, I want to explain about what What went on back there.
You see, one of the secretaries got, uh, a cinder in her, um, contact lens, and I-I was trying to Save it for later, Major Nelson.
Four o'clock, my house.
General Whetherby will be there.
And make it believable, will you?
Yeah.
But you don't want to hear about the secretary, then?
Uh, w-with With a cinder in her This has been a very strange day.
You and Amanda Bellows?
No.
You and Amanda Bellows.
You gave her that genie cream and you made her look like a A glamorous jet-set debutante.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
Well, I-it is true.
Genie cream will change a person's appearance if they wish it.
Would you turn Mrs. Bellows back the way she was?
Oh, yes, master.
Oh, heh, well, I-I cannot.
Well, y-you see, the spell is not on Mrs. Bellows.
It is in the cream.
Well, then change the cream.
I know.
I know, master!
I will blink an antidote.
Heh-heh.
Here it is, master.
Thank you.
I hope it works.
Yeah.
I hope so too.
Now, the next thing I want you to do Is stay in my bottle so that I will not get you into anymore trouble.
Absolutely right.
Will you let me out of here?
Yes, master.
Hm.
It will work.
Oh!
You.
What are you doing here?
Alfred, what's wrong?
Young woman, you have me confused with someone else.
I hate to say this, but I think one of us needs a psychiatrist fast.
But, Alfred, what are you doing?
Hiding you from my wife.
But I am your wife.
You'll never convince her of that.
Oh, hi, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, Major Healey, what can I do for you?
Oh, uh, uh Oh, nothing special, sir.
Uh, uh, oh, I was, uh I was wondering if you'd like to buy a ticket for the, uh, oh, for the Astronaut's, uh, Relief, uh, uh, Fund Ball.
No, Major Healey, I don't want any tickets.
Now would you kindly leave?
Alfred, let me out of here.
There's someone at your closet.
Do you want to get that, sir?
Alfred, I am your wife!
Oh.
Dr. Bellows, I'm shocked.
It's a mistake, major.
I'm getting out of here.
You're crazy.
Wait a minute.
I'll take care of it.
This way.
To the bedroom.
No!
Oh, no!
No, no, no, no, no, wait.
You take care of her.
I'll go and see if the coast is clear.
Oh.
The coast is clear?
In my bedroom?
You're all mad.
And I know what's happened.
It's germ warfare.
They've destroyed your minds.
The coast is clear.
Major Healey, what was that crash?
Oh, uh, uh, s-sonic boom, sir.
Terrible problem.
Oh.
Uh, why are we taking you in here?
I want her out of here, out of my life.
Oh, Alfred.
Yes, sir.
We all do.
You get that, sir.
I'll keep her out of sight.
Thank you very much, Major Healey.
I won't forget this.
Major Healey.
Ooh!
Get your hands Ooh!
Oh, oh!
Oh!
Not in there!
There are mirrors in there.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, Major Nelson, you're a bit early.
What is he doing in there?
Uh, who would that be, sir?
Uh, Major Healey.
It sounds like he's breaking mirrors.
I'll check on it.
Oh, no, no.
Wait.
Wait.
Oh He'll never believe me.
No one will ever believe me.
Oh.
Hello, Mrs. Bellows.
It's gonna be all right in a couple of minutes.
You stay away from me.
You're as crazy as the rest of 'em.
Huh?
Oh, excuse me.
Roger!
He knows it's me.
He knows who I am.
I had to break them all.
She started to look into them.
Maybe this is the one, huh?
All right, hang on to it.
Here's the antidote.
Shh.
Here's the antidote.
All we have to do is get it on Mrs. Bellows' face.
Okay?
Now, here, take that.
And don't mix 'em up.
I won't.
Mrs. Bellows!
Whoa, oh, oh.
Everything's gonna be just fine.
Major Nelson!
Uh, get that cream on her face.
Hmm?
Oh, hello, sir.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, General Whetherby is due here any minute.
I want that woman out of here before he comes.
Roger's taking care of that right now, sir.
But how?
There's no outside door in the bedroom.
Uh, that's That's right.
No, that's right.
There Oh, no, wait.
Oh, forget about the general.
What if Amanda should come home?
Well, I think there's little danger of that, sir.
Oh.
Uh, uh, m-m-m-m Major.
Ooh.
Funny place to hang your jacket.
Yeah.
Oh!
Wait, Mrs. Bellows.
Wait a minute.
I wanna talk, Mrs. Bellows.
Maniac!
No, Mrs. Bellows.
Mrs. Bellows, wait!
I don't wanna hurt you.
I just want to smear a little cream on your face.
In all my years in the Air Force, I've faced many dangers, and I've never flinched.
But if my wife found that other woman Oh, no.
No.
Oh.
You better pull yourself together, sir.
Yes.
Mrs. Bellows.
Mrs. Bellows.
Miss Uh, Mrs. Bellows?
She She won't come out.
Uh, uh, this is Major Nelson.
Please, let me in.
I I can explain everything.
Oh, uh, come in, general.
Come in, come in.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson's very anxious to explain what happened at the base.
Good.
Where is he?
Oh, he's right over here.
Oh, uh, he's not here yet.
From the look of things, doctor, neither are you.
I want you to know what a great service you've done for your country.
I have?
Yes.
About what?
Yeah, 'bout what?
Well, there are certain conditions in space that affect perception.
Uh, for instance, we had to know what would happen to an astronaut if he suddenly became unrecognizable to his fellow crewmates.
But why me?
Yeah, why her?
A very good question, Roger.
Thank you.
We needed someone who was unaware that the experiment was being conducted.
Oh, now, Major Nel And also someone who was bright, uh, intelligent, perceptive And beautiful.
And, of course, beautiful.
Oh Well I'm glad that I was some service.
But why didn't Alfred say something?
!
Uh, top secret.
He's been instructed not to breathe a word of this.
Ever.
Shall we conclude with the experiment?
Roger.
The cream.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, the cream.
Uh Oh, I think it was the gray one.
No.
No, wait a minute.
I think it was the The red.
Which one is it, Roge?
I'm not sure.
But, major, is the experiment still going on?
Oh, general, it's very important to us here at NASA that Major Nelson head this project.
You feel that strongly about him, do you?
Oh, yes, sir, I do.
Well, he better show up soon.
Because, besides explaining what he was doing in that closet, I'm going to wanna know why he's so late.
Major Healey, what are you doing?
I know it's here someplace.
And while you're explaining that, you can tell me why you've been breaking all my mirrors.
Huh?
Oh, ooh!
Oh, oh, oh!
Whoops, whoops.
Good idea, Roge.
Roger!
Would you come over here?
Yeah.
What?
We're gonna have to use all of 'em.
Get the other jar.
Right!
Mrs. Bellows, I wonder if you would assist us in the latter part of our experiment.
This is called a tactile sensory exploration.
Oh.
I Now, let's try this.
Oh!
Ooh!
Notice any difference in her?
No.
She just looks a little greasier.
Huh?
Greasier.
Get another one, another one.
Yeah, another one.
Oh.
Oh, no.
Do you notice anything?
Huh?
!
It worked!
It worked, Tony.
We did it.
We did it!
Tony, we did it.
Oh, it worked.
Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
Mrs. Bellows.
Uh, there you are, Mrs. Bellows.
Uh, you've been more than helpful.
Our experiment in tactile sensory exploration is over.
Not quite.
Oh!
That is tactile sensory revenge.
Mrs. Bellows.
Oh Well, you've gotta admit you had it coming.
Huh?
Oh, thanks.
Thanks.
Let me get a towel.
Oh  You okay?
Roge, I was just thinking.
If I was 10 years younger, I could handle this.
But Jeannie's making an old man out of me.
Now, about General Whetherby  Roge?
Roge, why are you looking at me like that?
Roger, hurry, I can't find it.
Jeannie, forget what he said about staying home.
Just get here.
In the Bellows' bathroom.
That's right.
The bathroom.
Tsk.
Oh.
Alfred, would you mind please telling me what is going on with the mirrors in this house?
I don't know, dear.
Major Healey seems to have a A thing about them.
Tell me, did you see anything strange in the bedroom?
No.
Just Major Nelson and Major Healey.
Oh, but it's all right, dear, because I know how to keep a secret.
Bedroom?
Major Nelson in the bedroom?
I thought you told me he wasn't here yet.
Uh, well, he's not, sir.
I mean, uh, not here.
Uh, I mean, uh  Jeannie, will you please control yourself and blink another jar of the antidote.
Oh.
I'm sorry, master.
I'm so sorry, but you look so funny.
Jeannie, please!
Oh.
Major Nelson, this is General Whetherby!
Will you come out here, please?
!
Jeannie, please.
Major Nelson, I'll give you exactly five seconds to get out here.
I'm a busy man!
Calling me, sir?
Major Nelson, you get ou You were in there.
You You said Uh, you said.
I s I said?
Oh, I have said all I am going to say on this or any subject for at least 24 hours.
Oh, General Whetherby, I'd like you to meet my fiancÃ©e.
This is Jeannie.
Whetherby's the one that found me trying to get the cinder out of the secretary's eye.
Oh, I am so happy to meet you, general.
Isn't it funny how the simplest things can become misunderstood?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
I, uh Well, Major Nelson, I have a feeling that I've be I've been very wrong about you.
Nobody with a fiancÃ©e as lovely and as charming as yours could possibly have done what I saw you doing.
It's a perfectly natural mistake, sir.
Come in and sit down, Major Nelson.
I want to hear your ideas on the Lunar Landing Project.
Heh-heh-heh.
Don't worry, sir.
She'll forgive you.
Amanda?
Amanda.
What have I done?
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Come in.
Are you ready to go, master?
Oh, doggone it, Jeannie.
I'm sorry.
I forgot We can't go shopping for your wedding gown today.
Uh, I've got this report to finish.
It's really important.
But, master, I'm so afraid someone will buy the one I have in mind.
Oh, come on.
Tony Oh, excuse me.
Would you sign these now for General Schaeffer?
Oh, yeah, sure.
Sure.
I'm sorry.
Uh Oh, this is my fiancÃ©e Jeannie.
This is Dolores.
Dolores.
Hi.
Very pleased to meet you.
Likewise.
Here, uh, Tony.
Mm-hm.
And down here.
Oh.
We were surprised about you and Tony.
We'd heard so little about you.
Oh, and right here.
Uh-huh.
And here.
Mm-hm.
Thank you.
Uh, well, like I was saying, it was It was kind of sudden for everybody, Jeannie and me Ah, listen, you better go and take this to General Schaeffer right away.
Don't want to keep him waiting.
I want to say bye to Jeannie.
I'll say goodbye for you.
Bye.
Jeannie.
Um, what was that all about?
Well, I I did not wish to bother you while you were busy.
Come on.
Jeannie, look, um, a-about shopping for your wedding dress, we'll, uh We'll go shopping for it tonight.
Ah-ah!
Tonight's out.
Hi, Jeannie.
Hi, Tony.
You're busy tonight.
Why?
What?
What am I so busy about?
The guys are throwing a little bachelor party in your honor.
Uh, a bachelor party?
Oh!
A party.
I love parties.
What shall I wear?
Uh, well, no women are allowed.
This is the groom's last chance to spend a night with his buddies.
It's strictly male, masculine.
Roger, no, no, no bachelor party.
Forget it, I remember the bachelor party you gave for Lieutenant Taylor.
Did Lieutenant Taylor get married?
Not after the bachelor party, he didn't get married, no.
Wait, you can't let your buddies down.
This is the married man's only chance to get out of the house.
Roge, just forget about it.
No bachelor party, okay?
It's hoax.
You know, forget it, okay?
If tradition means nothing to you, when I have my bachelor party, I'm not coming.
Master, if If a bachelor party is tradition, why do you not wish to have one?
Uh, because I know what Roger's bachelor parties are like.
Jeannie, the important thing is that I want to go shopping with you for your wedding gown.
Oh, master.
You're so sweet.
Oh, I wish you could see it.
It is lovely.
It It is all lace, and it has a long train that goes I will blink it on for you.
No, no, no, no.
Uh, Jeannie, it's an American tradition that the bridegroom is never supposed to see the bride in her wedding gown before the wedding.
Oh.
Well, I-I would not wish to go against tradition.
Now, uh, you go home and, um, I'll meet you there tonight, huh?
Oh, Major Nelson, did you?
Oh, hello, sir.
Major Nelson, why are you wearing a wedding dress?
Excuse me, sir.
Major Nelson, come out here this instant!
Yes, sir?
I'll see you tonight, darling.
Bye.
Bye.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
You wanted to talk to me, sir?
I certainly did.
I want to know why Oh, never mind, major.
Never mind.
Hello, Bubbles?
Yeah, well, about the party tonight, there's been a change of plans.
Yeah.
We have a surprise party.
Yeah, y-you tell the girls to wait for my call, huh?
I'll get in touch with them about the time and place.
Y-you're gonna wear what dress?
The one with Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tonight.
Great.
Ah.
No bachelor party.
Ridiculous.
But that's hard to believe, major.
He doesn't want a bachelor party?
Of course he does.
He just said that because Jeannie was there.
But a bachelor party is an American tradition.
Gives a man something to look back on.
Believe me, I've been married for 20 years and the happiest moment I can remember is my bachelor party.
Oh, uh, Amanda doesn't have to know I said that.
No, no, no, sir.
Uh, sir, about the party, I thought we could plan But if Major Nelson doesn't want one But, sir, I mean, we can't let Tony down.
I'd never forgive myself if I let my friend get married without a bachelor party.
But how are we gonna do it?
Ah, a surprise party.
Ingenious, major!
There's nothing like a good surprise party.
Thank you, sir.
Here's what I had in mind Now, first, we're gonna play some poker.
Poker?
Of course.
Five-card draw, seven-card stud, spit in the ocean.
Spit Well, I was thinking more of Bubbles.
Bubbles?
Oh, definitely.
We must have a few bottles of the old bubbly and a good cigar.
I'm not allowed to smoke cigars around the house.
Cigars, cigars, yeah.
About the entertainment, see Entertainment?
Naturally.
We'll have some football films.
Dr. Bell Oh.
Hi, Roge.
We're supposed to be at a meeting.
What are you doing here?
Well, Dr. Bellows was just checking my tennis elbow.
Blood pressure.
Blood pressure.
Tennis elbow.
I'm glad you reminded me about the briefing.
It'd be terrible to be late for a briefing.
Uh, sir, about the tennis elbow and the blood pressure, I'll see you later about that.
Oh, thank you for reminding me.
I'd never forgive myself if I missed a briefing.
Yeah.
Oh, I'd just hate myself.
A meeting tonight, sir?
Um, this There was nothing like that on the schedule.
He says there was nothing about it on the schedule.
Because it's secret.
Because it's secret.
I beg your pardon, sir.
I mean, it would hardly do to call a secret meeting and then let everybody know about it.
Uh, well, Dr Bellows, I promised Jeannie I'd take her shopping for a wedding gown.
Well, what for?
You already have one.
And that reminds me, major All right, I'll be there.
What time?
What time?
Nine-thirty, you'll pick him up.
Nine-thirty, I'll pick you up.
No, no, no.
Pick him up.
Oh.
Uh, 9:30, I'll pick you up.
I'll be waiting, sir.
Oh, all right, major.
Wait.
Uh, uh, wait.
Amanda.
What?
Tell him about Amanda.
Oh, yes.
Um, um Uh, major, why Uh, why doesn't Jeannie go to the movies with Amanda, so they'll be out of the way.
Oh, uh So they'll have something to do.
Uh, all right, sir.
Yeah.
I'll I'll suggest it.
Thanks.
Goodbye, major.
Very good, sir.
Very good.
Well, I'll go and start rounding up the, uh, entertainment.
I couldn't have done it without you, major.
I'm not very good at lying.
But you are.
Well Heh.
Beginner's luck.
Yeah.
I'm sorry, Jeannie.
Oh, well, it is all right, master.
I suppose when one marries an astronaut, one must expect the unexpected.
Yeah, well, it's not like marrying an ordinary, down-to-earth genie, is it?
Oh, I am not unhappy, master.
It is your job and your duty.
I understand completely.
Oh, master, tell me.
What must I do?
I want to be like all the other wives.
Ah, no, no, no.
I don't want you to do anything.
Just stay exactly the way you are.
Oh, Major Healey, uh, what are you doing with all those uniforms?
What am I doing with these uniforms?
Uh, I'm having my summer weights cleaned.
Oh.
Oh, don't worry about a thing, major.
I've got the poker chips and the cigars for tonight.
Yeah, yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Dolores.
Yes.
Be at the gate at 8:30.
Eight-thirty?
Yeah.
Pass it on.
Okay, major.
That's Mr. Colbert, General Mc Crory, Admiral Cooper and Mr. Williams.
That all checks out, sir.
Thank you, airman.
Oh, major, sir.
One of the officers dropped his purse?
Oh, that's not That's not a purse.
That's a BX-9-12-5-4-3-2-1- Morgan Finder.
Top secret.
Hush-hush.
Yes, sir.
Yeah.
You know, it's really very peculiar.
Alfred usually knows about these meetings way in advance.
Oh, well, let's see what's playing at the movies.
A-anything would be fine with me.
Oh, good.
Oh, I have an idea.
Why don't we call General Schaeffer's wife.
The general will be at the meeting too.
Maybe she'd like to go with us.
Fine.
Tell you what, you pick something out that you might like to see while I make the call.
Fine.
Fine.
General Schaeffer here.
Uh, General Schaeffer?
Well, this is Amanda Bellows.
Well, I'm very surprised to find you home.
I thought you'd be at the meeting.
What meeting?
The secret meeting at the base.
Oh, good heavens, I thought that was tomorrow night.
No, my husband and Major Nelson, well, they left over a half an hour ago.
Oh, my word.
I told the admiral it was tomorrow.
Well, uh, thank you for calling.
General?
General?
Well, isn't that interesting?
The general thought the meeting was tomorrow night.
Oh, well, was it not lucky that you phoned him?
Yes, it may have been very lucky that I phoned him.
Uh, didn't you say that they were going to give Tony a bachelor party?
Oh, yes, but my mas Uh Heh.
Anthony called it off.
I don't care what you say, lieutenant.
The meeting is tonight.
Now, you get on the phone, call the admiral, Undersecretary Spencer and the rest of them.
Tell them to meet me at the security gate.
What?
Of course I didn't make the mistake.
You made the mistake.
And you tell him that.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Alfred's cigars are gone.
Those Those sneaky men are gonna have that bachelor party at the base tonight.
Oh, but the bachelor party was called off.
Anthony told me.
I know what Anthony told you, it's the same thing that Alfred told me.
Oh, listen, before you get married, there's something you better learn about men.
Oh, what is that?
They're liars.
All of them, poor dears.
Can't help it.
It's in their natures.
Oh.
Well, my Anthony would never lie to me.
Oh, my dear, if you really believe that, you're not ready for marriage.
I am going to take you to NASA and open your eyes.
Oh, well, I-I do not think so, Mrs. Bellows.
You go if you must, but, uh, I-I believe I will just go to the movies.
Hm, the whole trouble with marriage in America today, there's too much trust.
Uh, you can open your eyes now, airman.
The, uh, top-secret personnel are inside.
Yes, sir.
Oh.
Major Healey.
Hi, Roge, I see you got stuck with this meeting too.
Yeah.
Stuck with the meeting.
Ha-ha-ha.
Airman, are you wearing perfume?
I beg your pardon, sir?
Oh, never mind.
After you, major.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, would you kindly take this mannequin out of the way.
Must've been left over from another conference.
Oh, uh, major, I, uh I've got the poker chips and the cigars.
This is gonna be quite a surprise.
Yes, a surprise.
Heh.
Oh, uh, major, why are those officers wearing those coats?
Uh, maybe you better turn off the air-conditioning.
Well, they'll warm up as soon as the party gets started.
Boy, they sure make these dummies lifelike.
Jeannie?
Hello, master.
Put your hand there.
Oh What are you doing here?
Tsk.
Oh, I'm sorry, master.
I'm so ashamed.
You see, Amanda Bellows said that you lied to me about the bachelor party and that you were going to have one.
Mmm.
Well, uh, come on, Jeannie, get out of here.
T-the meeting's about to be starting.
I know, master.
And that is why I'm so ashamed.
You see, Mrs. Bellows is on her way over here to catch you and Dr. Bellows, but I said that I trusted you.
And then I Heh.
I had to come see for myself.
Well, now you've seen.
Go home.
Go on.
Go on.
Oh, yes, master.
Instantly.
Can you ever forgive me?
Yes, I forgive you.
I forgive you.
Kiss me to show me you forgive me.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
Uh, Major Nelson.
Yes.
You're wondering why I was kissing the mannequin.
Uh, kissing the mannequin?
Uh, no, no, no, I wasn't wondering that at all.
You weren't wondering why?
Uh, no, I, um I'm just here to tell you that we're ready to begin.
For he's A jolly good fellow BELLOWS &  For he's a jolly good fellow  For he's A jolly good fellow That nobody can deny Major Healey, what's the meaning of this?
!
Happy bachelor party, Tony.
I must apologize, Mr. Secretary.
I could have sworn this meeting was scheduled for tomorrow night.
Heh-heh, that's the Navy for you, sir.
In the Air Force, we keep our calendars straight.
Right this way.
Here's a hat for you, honey.
Oh, that's adorable!
That's fine.
Uh, sir, I I really must speak to you.
Uh, don't blame this on me, major.
I thought we were having football films.
Where are all the rest of the guys?
Oh, well, uh, these are all the guys I could find.
Here you are.
Do you drink?
No.
Good.
Have two.
Oh.
Come on and dance, honey.
The party's in your honor.
Well, I'd like to very much, but I gotta talk to Dr. Bellows.
Move, baby!
Move!
But you don't understand.
We're supposed to play spit in the ocean, one-eyed Jacks.
Wild!
Right, wild!
I really have to talk to you.
Mrs. Bellows knows about it.
She's coming here.
Oh.
Amanda?
Yes.
Here?
Yeah.
You're not dancing.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Look, major, if my wife finds me here, it'll cost you your rank.
My rank?
!
Why my rank?
Now you're not dancing.
Well, it's your bachelor party!
Oh, well, in that case, heh, you all enjoy yourselves.
Major, what'd you close that door for?
Open it.
I I can't.
What do you mean, you can't?
You mean?
Uh, no, no, it couldn't be.
Not my wife.
No, sir.
General Schaeffer.

It's a closet game.
You'll love it.

And this.
Thank you.
Good idea, closet game.
I like closets.
Ladies, please, in the closet.

What are we doing?
Oh, there isn't enough room!
I know  A-ten-hut!
Well, major, have you forgotten how to salute?
Hm?
Oh, sorry, sir.
I see you have forgotten.
Sorry, sir.
A-ten-hut!
Major, what are all these women doing here?
Uh, the women, sir?
Oh, yes, they're recruits, sir.
Recruits?
Well, Mike, you're going to have some Air Force.
Go on, major, tell us about what you're recruiting these girls for.
Uh, they're WAFs, sir.
They want to be WAFs.
Don't you, Miss?
Uh Just call me Francine, sweetie.
Um, m-major, we were called here to a meeting, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with recruiting.
Now, we've told our wives we were going to a meeting.
Is there a meeting or isn't there?
Uh, well, actually, sir, it's my, uh, bachelor party.
Bachelor party?
Yeah.
Well, why didn't you say so in the first place?
I haven't been to a good bachelor's party in years.
Come to think of it, heh-heh, neither have I. Uh, well, what do you think, Mr. Secretary?
Well, if it's okay with him, it's okay with me.
Congratulations, son.
Tomorrow, wedding bells, but tonight we whoop it up!

Wait a minute, sir!
You don't understand.
Amanda Bellows is on her way over here.
Uh, sir Excuse me.

Tomorrow.
All right, uh  I'm terribly sorry.
Oh!
Heh-heh.
Uh, uh, sir.
Could we draw a close to?
Doctor?
Mm?
Would you?
Would you?
Uh, Roger.
Roger, come here.
I want you to stop this thing.
Amanda Bellows is on her way over here.
Don't worry.
We've got enough cake.
How about that, huh?
I hate it!
You hate it?
It says "congratulations" on the top.
It should say "condolences".
If Amanda Bellows ever sees that You should see what's inside.
Great filling.
Oh, come on, major!
Come on!
Wait a minute!
Hey, take it easy!
Dr. Bellows, we gotta get out of here.
Your Your wife is gonna be here any minute.
Delicious fruit punch, major.
Simply delicious.
You must try some.
Uh, sir, your wife is coming here.
She can't see you like this.
Amanda?
Marvelous woman, but frankly, major, I didn't think she'd fit in.
She's, uh, not hep.
Cheers.
Well, I've done all I can.
I knew it!
I knew it!
Let me in there.
Major Nelson, that's Amanda Bellows.
I've been trying to tell you.
She's the worst gossip on the base.
Now she'll tell everyone.
She'll tell my wife.
What do you want me to do, sir?
I don't know, but I'll tell you one thing: If my wife hears about this, you're done for.
Me?
Yes, you.
It's your bachelor party.
We've got to hide the girls.
Not only the girls, we We gotta hide us.
Hold that door, major.
Come on, everybody!
I know what's going on in there.
Let me in!
Is the party over, Major Healey?
We're just going into winter quarters.
Would you mind helping me?
I'll take that.
Let me in there!
Easy, easy, easy, does it.
Into the closet.
Into the closet.
Let me in here!
Roger, the music.
Oh, the music!
Oh, good evening, Mrs. Bellows.
You're late.
The meeting just broke up.
If that was a meeting, major, I'm the Queen of the May.
Major.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Bellows.
We were just cleaning up.
Don't you mean, clearing up?
Would you mind stepping aside and letting me in the closet, please.
No, you wouldn't want to go in there.
Oh, yes, I would.
Yes, I would, major!
Do you mind?
Why didn't you go in the closet?
Because it would've been a little crowded, master.
I don't have time to explain, Jeannie.
Oh, there's nothing to explain.
You lied to me.
No, I didn't lie to you.
You lied.
I Roger lied to me.
I didn't know.
Oh, really, master.
Yeah.
All those girls dressed in men's clothes and you did not know?
Well, you were here.
You didn't know either?
That is true.
Yeah.
Oh.
Oh, I am so sorry.
Oh, my darling master, can you ever forgive me?
Come on, we don't have time for all that.
Oh, well, I-I can't, uh, open that door, Mrs. Bellows.
There's, uh, radioactive material in there.
Some very, very hot stuff.
I'll bet.
Yeah.
Oh, it's all right, major.
I'll wait.
Sooner or later, you're going to have to open that door.
Would you like some punch?
Never mind, major.
Aha-ha-ha!
Aha!
Oh!
I suppose you're, uh, wondering what I'm doing kissing this mannequin.
I'm not kissing it.
I'm trying to hide it.
It's a new WAF uniform.
No one's supposed to see it, you see?
Major, not two minutes ago, I stood over there in that doorway and I saw a party.
A A wild party going on.
Uh Don't tell me I didn't see it, because I know what I saw.
I assure you nothing was going on.
Don't assure me, major, please.
I saw girls Live girls!
In this room, and they are now in that closet over there that Major Healey will not let me Aha!
Aha-ha!
Ha!
Ha!
General Mrs. Bellows, what are you doing here?
Uh Don't you know that these new firefighting suites are top-secret?
I B-but Bu Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
Major, please.
I don't feel very well.
I'd like to go home.
I want to go home, major.
I wish you'd see me home, you know, because I want to go and tell Alfred for those terrible things I was thinking.
You just lean on my shoulder.
Oh Aha!
Aha!
It's a cake.
Just a cake.
That's all.
I know what it is.
You get out of my way, major!
Get out of my way!
Ooh!
Alfred!
Happy bachelor party!
Happy bachelor party, master.
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
Ooh, I cannot make up my mind.
Heh.
They are both so beautiful.
Well, Jeannie, I-it's silly to rush an important thing like selecting an engagement ring.
And, uh, we do have the blood test to get.
And I've gotta be back at the base at 10 for the practice alert.
So why don't we select it tomorrow?
Well, children, have you decided?
They are both lovely.
And both unique.
One-of-a-kind diamonds for the one-of-a-kind bride.
Well, thank you, sir.
I think we best come back tomorrow.
Thank you.
Well, now, that's something more like what I had in mind.
Master, that lady is taking my ring.
Huh?
Shhh, don't call me master.
It's all right.
There are plenty of rings.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
That's all right.
No harm done.
Uh, excuse me.
Is, uh, my watch ready?
Yes.
Just one moment.
My, what beautiful rings.
Master, that woman has my rings.
Shhh, Jeannie.
We won't need the rings unless we get a blood test.
There's a doctor right around the corner.
We can get a blood Hey, wait a minute.
I was just thinking.
There's nothing peculiar about your blood, is there?
Oh, well, of course not, darling.
Genies have blood just like everyone else.
With corpuscles.
Red and green.
Good.
Green?
Gotta be a way.
There just has to be a way.
Well, I think it is perfectly silly of you not to take advantage of my natural talents.
Oh, darling, how many times have I told you, you can't blink away every little problem, you know?
Oh, well, this is not a little problem.
If we do not have our blood test, we cannot get our marriage license.
And if we do not have our marriage license, we cannot get married.
I know, I know, I know, I Well, if I'm gonna marry you, I just have to learn to compromise, that's all.
Oh, I am glad I have such a sensible master.
Now, tell me.
Mm?
What is in it?
What's in what?
Blood.
Oh.
Oh, well, uh, there's, uh, red corpuscles and, uh, white corpuscles.
White corpuscles.
And, uh, uh Well, a bunch of other stuff.
What other stuff?
Well, I don't know.
Nobody knows everything that's in it.
Well, how can I possibly blink it if I do not know what is in it?
Well, just think blood, I guess.
I don't know.
Ooh, well, I could not do that.
Yeah, that's right.
You know what?
We're right back where we started from.
We're gonna have to g-get ahold of some normal blood.
Hi, Jeannie, Tony.
Practice alert starts in 10 minutes.
W-why are you both looking at me like that?
What, uh?
What's?
What's the matter?
Is everything all right?
I'd be delighted to give you both a blood test.
Anything to further the cause of true love.
Well, shall it be ladies first?
Uh, no, sir.
I'll go first.
I wanna show Jeannie it doesn't hurt.
Well, I-if you do not mind, Anthony, I would rather not watch.
I shall wait out in the hall.
Yeah.
She's a little squeamish.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, just remove your coat, major.
Yes.
Listen, can you get somebody else?
I don't mind giving you the shirt off my back, but my blood?
Please, Major Healey.
This is very important.
Yeah, but Dr. Bellows has been stabbing and jabbing at me all day long.
Why, are you sick?
No, it's just a routine checkup, but  Oh, that is the signal.
Wait a minute.
Well.
Are you all right, darling?
Are you all right?
Oh, he's fine.
I didn't know you were squeamish too.
I'm sorry, sir.
Be brave, darling.
I hope you'll be more courageous than your friend here.
You're next, Jeannie.
Well, let me see.
Uh, Jeannie?
Yes, doctor?
You don't have to go behind there.
It's just a blood test.
If you do not mind, I would rather not watch.
Well, if you don't wanna look, you can just close your eyes.
I wonder if you could humor her.
She's a She's a little squeamish about this.
It's the first time she's I understand.
All right then, just stick your arm right through the curtain.
The watch, the watch.
Did you say something?
Eh, I I said Ha.
I-I said, thank you, doctor, for For not making me watch.
Oh.
Now, we're just gonna tie this around here to spot a vein.
There we are.
Now, if it gets too tight, you let me know.
My, that's quite a muscular arm.
She plays a lot of tennis, sir.
Oh.
Now, let me see.
Well, now, just hold it steady.
Oh!
Oop.
There, now, that didn't hurt too much, did it?
Oh, no, doctor.
That did not hurt me a bit.
There we are.
We'll just put a little cotton there.
Now, it'll just take a few minutes to run these through to the lab.
Right.
Oh, uh, I'll need your other hand.
No, no.
Why don't you go get it?
No.
Oh, Jeannie, your other hand.
There we are.
Now.
Well, that's strange.
Your left arm isn't nearly as muscular as your right.
Uh, she's right-handed, sir.
Ohhh.
And this one is wearing nail polish, while the other one She didn't have time to finish it this morning.
Hadn't we better get the blood to the laboratory?
Uh, oh, oh, yes, yes.
Here we are.
You know, uh, uh, major, it seems to me, she's such a slender girl to have a muscular arm like that.
Yes, she's unusual in every respect.
Major Healey, you almost spoiled everything.
Why did you make me use my own arm?
Because Dr. Bellows gave me five injections in that arm this morning.
He'd have recognized it.
Oh.
Yeah.
What did he inject?
Oh, the usual.
The usual?
Yeah.
Tetanus, typhus, yellow fever, cholera.
The works.
Ooh, good.
Yeah, good.
Cholera?
Typhoid and yellow fever?
Dr. Bellows said that all of them showed up in your blood.
Well, naturally.
Isn't that the idea?
Roger, the idea is that it was supposed to be Jeannie's blood.
Dr. Bellows thinks she's a walking epidemic.
Well, that is better than thinking I'm a walking genie.
Ah, no.
No, darling.
Not much better.
Dr. Bellows is not gonna give us that certificate until he gives you a full examination and another blood test.
Wait a minute.
I don't mind masquerading as Jeannie's arm, but they're not gonna Oh, Roger, don't be ridiculous.
Oh, master, I do not think it is a good idea for Dr. Bellows to examine me.
Yes, I I think we're all in agreement on that.
Now, you just go home and I'll think of something.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Dr. Bellows.
Now, Jeannie, uh, there's nothing to worry about.
We're gonna find out exactly what's going on.
I hope not.
That's very kind of you, sir, but, uh, not today.
You see, Jeannie, uh I do not feel very well.
Well, of course you don't.
That's why we're going to examine you.
No, no, sir.
She really can't today.
She She has, uh, an appointment with her dentist.
Hairdresser.
Mechanic.
Dentist, hairdresser, mechanic?
Which is it?
Uh, all three, sir.
She has a very busy schedule this afternoon.
I said before this is far more important.
Argh!
What is that?
Eh, that, uh That's a practice alert.
It's okay.
Yes.
For the next four hours, this base will be entirely sealed off.
No one will enter or leave.
Now, shall we proceed with the examination?
Well, uh, I believe that, uh, Major Nelson, Major Healey, you, uh, have a few checkpoints to inspect.
Now, I'll see you in five minutes in the examining room.
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you.
I'll get that, sir.
Thank you, doc Dr. Bellows.
Goodbye, master.
I-I am going to Ormandy's.
What are you going to Ormandy's for?
W-w-well, I only have five minutes, and that woman may buy my ring.
No, no, no, no.
Look, uh, uh, call 'em on the phone.
I-I got the telephone number in my wallet.
Wait a minute.
My wallet's gone.
That guy I ran into.
The guy that bumped me.
He stole my wallet.
He picked my pocket.
Ooh, that is terrible.
I will boil him No, no, no.
Don't do anything I wasn't sure.
Well, I am sure.
Well, it might've been Come on, Tony.
The alert!
Huh?
Oh.
I'll What are you doing?
Don't kiss her.
She may have some of those diseases.
Huh?
Oh.
Five minutes.
Oh.
Hello?
Hello.
I would like to speak to Ormandy's jewelry store, please.
Sorry, no outside calls during the alert.
Oh, b-but this is very import  Oh.
Five minutes.
Uh, just a minute, please.
I believe you have my master's wallet.
Mm-hm.
Taxi!
Taxi!
Somebody moved the street.
Something, somebody moved the street.
I would like my master's wallet, please.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, yes, you do.
This morning in Ormandy's you stole my fiancÃ©'s wallet, and I want it back.
L-look, lady, I'll make a deal with you.
You can have the wallet back if you'll just tell me where I am.
Oh, well, that seems fair.
You're at NASA.
So?
Where's Ormandy's?
Well, for the moment, right through that door.
I'll take my chances with Ormandy.
But wait.
We made a deal.
Ugh.
Oh, ah, all right, Jeannie, we're ready.
Uh, who were you talking to?
Oh, uh, a man who has Anthony's wallet.
And he came all the way to NASA to return it?
Why, that's marvelous how honest some people are.
Oh, we're ready to get started with the examination.
This way.
Now, let me see.
You've decided on the brooch and the bracelet.
Now, what about the ring?
I'm sure your daughter would adore that.
Oh, I just can't seem to make up my mind.
Mama was right.
Crime doesn't pay.
Oh, let me look at that.
Oh, that's an adorable little canary-yellow diamond set in platinum with a tiny filigree design right around there.
Oh, that's charming.
I like the color too.
Dr. Bellows, you do not understand.
I understand perfectly.
Like all young people, you feel that you don't need a complete physical examination.
Well, let me tell you, any young couple contemplating marriage should definitely   I'm sorry.
That lamp isn't for sale.
Ah, yeah.
I-I was just admiring it.
You really can't tell in here, Mrs. Horlick.
Step outside and see it in the sunlight.
Oh.
Major.
Come back to have another look at the rings?
The rings?
Uh, yes.
Mm-hm.
I'm just about to show one of them to Mrs. Horlick in the sunlight, if you'll excuse me.
No.
Uh, what I mean is, you You wouldn't like it out there, sir.
It's gotten very cloudy.
Overcast.
You can't see a thing.
Why, how ridiculous.
It's a clear, sunny day.
Oh, no.
No, really.
I, uh A tropical storm just came up.
Major, would you kindly stand aside?
It's hurricane weather.
I'm not kidding.
I would advise you to get your storm Excuse me, lady, could I borrow a hairpin?
Don't open the window.
Don't Mr. Ormandy, look.
Ah.
Oh.
Not a cloud in the sky.
Now, see here, major, if you're trying to prevent this lady from buying your fiancÃ©e's ring by making up this story  Hi, Tony.
Oh, too bad we have to be inside on such a beautiful day.
Hey, you redecorated.
Mr. Ormandy, would you kindly tell me what is going on here?
Well, it's really very simple, Mrs. Horlick.
You see, that man and his fiancÃ©e were in here looking at rings this morning.
Roger, would you come over here, please?
Yeah.
Uh, how do you like that?
Oh, a nice job.
Quick too.
Quick.
Hey, you wouldn't happen to have a hacksaw on you, would you?
Oh, you decorators never carry your own tools.
Ha, ha.
Roger, come over here.
Yeah, yeah.
This This is really nice.
It's a little jewelry-store modern, but nice.
It is a jewelry store.
Jeannie blinked it here.
Nice, huh?
Well, in that case, maybe I can have my watch fixed.
It's slow.
Roger, forget about your wat I I've gotta find Jeannie and have her blink this place back.
You stand guard here and don't you let anybody in or out.
Wait a minute.
What if somebody wants to go home?
Don't let 'em.
They'll walk right out into a NASA corridor.
Listen, major, I'll give you back your wallet if you'll Nobody listens.
He's probably gone to get his fiancÃ©e now.
Well, if he feels as strongly as that about the ring, let him have it.
Send the other things to my house.
Don't go, don't go, don't go.
Major, Mrs. Horlick has very kindly decided to let your friend have that ring, so don't you start causing trouble.
Oh, well, we have lots of rings.
Oh, here's a nice zircon over here Young man, take your hands off me.
Oh, no, no.
Major, if this nonsense doesn't cease instantly, I shall have to call the police.
No, don't!
What is going on here?
Yes, what's going on?
What's going on here?
!
What's going on here?
Uh Uh It's a stickup.
Oh.
Everybody against the safe.
Against the safe.
Come on.
Listen, major, if you'll just give me a hand with these cuffs, I'll give you a hand.
Look up, please, Jeannie.
There.
Dr. Bellows, what is that you just put in my eyes?
Well, just something to dilate the pupils.
Now, uh, follow my finger.
But it feels funny.
And I do not seem to be able to blink.
That's right.
But don't worry.
It'll wear off in an hour or two.
Well, everything normal there.
Now, uh, cross your legs, please.
Hm?
Oh.
Well, that's odd.
Oh, hello, Dr. Bellows.
How's everything coming along?
Fine, darling.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, I want you to see this.
That's the patella reflex.
Her knee is supposed to jerk forward.
Your knee is supposed to jerk forward.
Oh, my knee is supposed to jerk forward.
You're hitting the wrong place.
Major, please.
I'm a doctor.
Oh, for heaven's sakes.
What's going on here?
Can't you see what you're doing?
Please blink Ormandy's back.
Oh, master, that man with your wallet is in there, and I I don't care.
I want you to blink it back.
I am afraid it is impossible, master.
I cannot blink.
Huh?
That's right.
She cannot blink.
Her pupils are dilated.
Ha, ha.
Well, that isn't too serious, is it, Jeannie?
Unless, of course, you want to, uh, flirt with me.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, sir, how long will it take for the chemical to wear off?
Oh, an hour, half-hour.
Depends on the individual.
And how long is the examination gonna last, sir?
I'm finished.
And I'm delighted to report that Jeannie is a perfectly healthy girl.
Oh, well, thank you, Dr. Bellows.
Could we have the certificate now?
Oh, yes.
Uh, as soon as I have this, uh, second blood sample analyzed.
Oh, major, what is the matter?
Sorry.
I'll get it.
I You took another sample, sir, of, uh, Jeannie's blood?
Yes, we did.
Undoubtedly they made a mistake the first time.
Uh, I'm happy to announce that Jeannie hasn't got one single abnormal symptom.
Oh, good.
Ow!
What's the matter with you?
You almost made me drop it.
I'm awfully sorry, sir.
Why don't I take this sample of blood to?
Over to the laboratory?
Never mind.
I'll Please, major Whoa!
You are the clumsiest  I know.
I'm just not used to being here.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'm awfully sorry.
You are without a doubt the slowest crook I've ever seen.
I just can't hold my hands up any longer.
All right, all right, you can put 'em down.
But don't try to make a break for it.
No, the base is sealed I mean, the jewelry store is sealed off.
Major, if you're going to rob this store, would you kindly rob it?
Uh, well, I, uh, can't decide what I want.
Maybe you could, uh, show me something you like.
Oh, well, we have this lovely teardrop neck Uh, major.
Would you please rob the store?
I want to call the insurance company.
Well, I can't decide what to steal.
Oh, Major Nelson, I wish you'd be more careful in the future.
I'm sorry.
This is one of my clumsy days.
I can see that.
Let me have this.
No, not the blood, sir.
Please.
We have some important questions to ask you.
Oh, that is right.
Some questions.
Don't you want your certificate?
Of course we want the certificate, sir, but Don't move.
What?
Don't move.
Why not?
There's a bee.
A bee?
A bee?
Where?
What?
The syringe.
The syringe.
Where?
What's the matter with you?
I don't see any bee.
Why, there's no bees.
Huh?
Huh?
Well, open the door and let him out.
Let him out.
We can't let him out.
Why not?
What's the matter with you?
Will you stop this nonsense?
Get that thing.
Where?
I have thing for bees.
Give me hives.
Ha-ha-ha!
What are you doing?
Don't move.

Not me, him.
I feel it.
I feel that Jeannie has swatted it.
I see it.
Don't move.
Stay right there.
I'll get it.
Now.
Shhh.
There you are, sir.
Ooh, ooh.
That's a nasty one.
We better take a look at that, sir.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Huh?
Thank you.
Don't worry.
Don't look.
Don't look, sir.
Just a minute.
I'm not an intern.
I've seen blood before.
What's the matter with you?
Sir, how long do you think it'll take to get a report from the lab?
Oh, about 10 minutes.
Oh, good, good, good.
May I help you?
Oh.
Master.
Huh?
Where is the bee?
There's no bee, darling.
Mwah.
You were beautiful.
You did it all by yourself.
You didn't blink.
Mm-mm.
You didn't blink?
Mm-mm.
Can you blink?
Mm Not yet.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Good.
Good.
Well, we may have won the battle, but we lost the war.
What's that?
Uh, three.
That one?
S. That one?
Uh X. You better lie down.
We'll just have to wait until the chemical wears off.
Here, lie down.
Take it easy.
Rest your eyes, will you?
Oh, Dr. Bellows said it was only gonna take about 10 minutes.
It's 15 already.
Oh, well, master, darling, do not worry.
As you said, blood is a very complicated thing.
After all, it has red corpuscles and white corpuscles and green corpuscles and a bunch of other stuff.
Forget the green corpuscles.
Operator.
Oh, operator, would you get me the lab, please?
Yeah, the laboratory.
Master, what is this?
Huh?
Oh, that That's a scale.
Oh.
What does it do?
Uh, uh, it It gives you your weight, Jeannie.
Hello, the lab?
Uh, Dr. Bellows, please.
How does it work?
Uh, Alfred J Uh, yeah.
Alfred Bellows.
That's right.
Here.
Uh, yeah, I am.
Uh, oh, you see, you get the average weight about what you weigh here, see, on the big one.
You slide this up and down until it balances.
Where it balances, that tells you what you weigh.
Yeah, I am.
Master, what does it say?
Uh A hundred and twenty-seven.
It lied!
Shhh!
Oh, not you.
No, sorry.
Uh, y-yes.
Yes, doc Dr. Bellows.
He did?
Oh, but he was down there trying to get us a rush-up job on On the blood sample.
Oh, all right.
Where is he?
He went to Major Nelson's office.
Oh.
Master!
Dr. Bellows!
Sir, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Dr. Bell He's It's over.
The whole ball of wax Master, master.
He went into Ormandy's.
Master, I can blink.
Oh, great.
You can blink.
I can blink, I can blink.
Great.
Well, of course you can blink.
I told you the dilation would only last a little while.
See?
You can blink.
You can blink?
Oh.
A minor miracle, major.
Yeah.
Ha, ha.
I told you she could blink.
Now, if you'll stop talking nonsense, here's your certificate.
Congratulations.
I wish I had as healthy blood as you, Jeannie.
Oh, I am sure that you do, doctor.
Yeah.
Oh, by the way, uh, there's a man in there delivering a lamp for you.
How he ever got in here during the alert, I'll never know.
Oh, I'm sure I can explain Eh, don't explain, major.
Dr. Bellows is such a nice man.
Oh.
Oh.
I'll go straight.
I'll go straight.
Just don't make it happen again.
Get rid of him.
Your wallet.
No, I don't need it.
Just get rid of him.
Get rid of him.
You got rid of everything else.
I don't Oh, great.
Thanks a lot.
Mm-hm.
My wallet?
What do you mean, my wallet?
He's got my wallet?
Get him back here, will you?
Yes, master.
Thank you.
The wallet, please.
Wallet.
Please, lay off me.
All right, over there.
Over there.
Over there.
This must be a robbery.
How'd you get in here?
Eh, f-from the street.
Please don't hurt me.
Don't worry.
I won't hurt you.
Uh miss?
Miss, it's okay.
Sir.
Sir, it's all right.
A one-of-a-kind diamond for the one-of-a-kind bride.
Now, I, uh, hate to steal and run, but, uh, I gotta go.
Uh, sorry, uh, I held you up.
Heh.
Bye.
I have the loveliest earrings for this.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Well, there it is, Major Nelson.
Our first fully automated flight plan.
And the newly modified T-38 ready for takeoff.
Congratulations, major.
Oh, thank you, sir.
Uh You don't seem very happy, major.
It's an honor to be selected to check out this new equipment.
Oh.
Yeah, I know that, sir.
But there's not much for me to do.
I mean, look at the flight plan.
Uh, the T-38 takes off by itself, finds a course of 067 at 50,000 feet by itself, lands in Puerto Rico by itself, and then repeats the whole process in reverse.
I feel more like a babysitter than a pilot.
I know it's a long way from flying a P-40 by the seat of your pants.
Hm-hm.
But even though the controls are completely computerized, you have to be there in case of, uh, malfunction.
Yes, the chances of which are statistically negligible.
But I'm with you, major.
This is progress, I suppose.
Mm.
Well, happy babysitting.
We'll see you at your house this afternoon.
All right, sir.
See you later.

He was wearing a faceplate, with a snorkel in his mouth.

My Anthony will be at the party.

Sit down, please.
Anthony Nelson, Major, Air Force, 10610908.
What, uh?
What was all that?
Name, rank and serial number.
By the articles of the Geneva Convention, that's all a prisoner's required to give.
You are not a prisoner.
You are a pain in the neck.
Major we are a small country.
A very poor country.
We cannot afford all these people bringing their planes to our airport.
Do you know what it costs in doughnuts alone?
What?
In doughnuts?
Cousin.
This is not an airliner.
It's a military plane.
And it's already on the ground.
ÃÂ¡Silencio!
Major.
You don't want to work in the cane fields for 12 hours a day.
You don't want to stand under the hot sun and listen to Fidel give five-hour speeches.
But, cousin.
That is treason.
So it's treason!
Oh.
Maybe Fidel will deport me.
Well, if you feel that way, why don't you let me go?
Exactly what I was about to suggest.
Go home, major.
Take your airplane and go home, Yankee.
Go home!
: Where is he?
Where is he taking imperialist spy?
At last, I'm going to be rewarded.
Are you from Fidel?
Of course I am from Fidel.
He talks funny.
Roger This man.
This man, he must go to prison immediately so Fidel can interrogate him himself.
Cut it out.
They're gonna Don't worry about it.
I'm not gonna let them take you.
Quiet, capitalist puerco!
That's Spanish for "pig".
I am sorry, major.
I thought you were just another one of those gringos locos.
Heh.
Ah.
I must take this man to prison immediately.
To prison, to prison.
Just a minute.
Wait a minute.

Oh, yes.
He has been found.
Excuse me, please.
Poor thing.

Come to think of it, neither can I.  Hurry up, Tony.
I bribed the guard to look the other way.
And I only had enough money for one look.

But you know, you really can't admire this properly standing up.
Uh, you really should be sitting down.
Mm.
Uh Uh, you get an excruciating view from this angle.
Jeannie!
I have the perfect solution, master.
Since you love it and I hate it, why do we not keep it here in your office?
Huh?
Because this thing would drive me completely up the wall.
Now, I don't love it.
I hate it as much as you do.

We are only going to be honest with my relatives.
No, look.
I promise you that I promise you, I'll figure out a way to get rid of it.

Well, there's nothing to worry about, sir.

He's got the place done up like Ali Baba's harem.
His house?
No, no, no.
His office.
The only problem is, is the mosquitoes.
Ali Baba's harem?

Well, goodbye.
I can hardly wait to see the house.
I'm sure you'll love it.
Heh.
Dr. Bellows, I could cry.
Dr. Bellows, I tell you, a mad home wrecker broke in and destroyed the whole place.
Yes, every bit of it.
What?
No, please.
Please, don't come over.
Dr. Bellows!
Shall never be able to recreate it.
Never.
In a million years.
Oh.
A mad home wrecker.
Tsk.
How horrible.
The poor man.
I love it.
I adore it.
I am crazy about it.
Blah.
Heh.
Now, I must find my master and tell him about the mad home wrecker.
He was right.
The home wrecker really wrecked his home.
Uh, gentlemen, I apologize for that, uh The silly phone call.
But you see, I'm subject to blackouts.
Uh, Sagittarians are famous for it.
You mean, this is what you intended to do?
Down to the smallest, uh, detail.
Just stuns you, doesn't it?
Oh, yeah.
Stun.
Stun.
St How c?
How could you?
I was the mad home wrecker.
Well, I'm sorry, master.
I did not know, and And I felt so sorry for the poor man.
Yeah, well, you better start feeling sorry for us.
We're We're gonna have to live in that horror.
Oh.
It's nauseating.
Positively nauseating.
Tables made of cannon shells.
Lamps from machine guns.
Simply ghastly.
Well, darling, look, we'll just have to keep them away from it.
You know, until we can fix it up.
Well, we can't ask Major Nelson to sleep in his office forever.
You can, sir.
You're a general.
Hello!
Uh Oh.
Hi.
Hello.
Everybody ready?
Uh, w-w-well, no.
Not quite.
No.
There are a few little, heh, details that we have to work out before you can see it.
For example: Uh, do you like this color drape or this color?
Uh.
Oh, either one.
What a marvelous room.
Oh, Anthony, do you like it?
Ah.
Oh, great.
Great.
Yeah.

Stunning.
It's absolutely stunning.
My supreme masterpiece.
This isn't the room we saw.
Uh, Major Healey, tell them about the table with the, uh With the cannon shells and the lamps with the machine guns.
Uh, in the living room, sir?
Don't worry, doctor, they're probably in the same place as Ali Baba's harem.
Mr. Helasco!
Mr. Helasco.
What happened?
It must be another one of his fainting spells.
He's a Sagittarius, you know.
Is he?
So is Alfred.
Uh.
Dr. Bellows.
Are you all right, sir?
Dr. Bellows?
Oh.
Oh, dear.
Okay, just sit down over here, sir.
Can't stand it.
All the fuchsia.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Stay there.
Oh.
I am not sure.
Ooh, peculiar.
Not at all, my dear.
Collages are arranged in this manner in the best houses.
Oh, Uncle Azmire.
It's a distinct pleasure to see you, my dear.
I came as soon as I heard, of course.
Oh, well, it is good to see you too, uncle.
Heh.
As soon as you heard what?
Why, that you were getting married.
As the eldest son of the seventh son, it is, of course, my familial duty to approve your future husband.
Is it?
Heh.
I did not know.
Ah, it's the same all over.
The younger generation has no respect for tradition.
I assure you, my dear, hm, that without my approval, you cannot get married.
Now that's what I calls art.
Uncle Vasmir!
You too?
In the flesh.
Sorry I'm late.
I left right after the sixth race.
Give me a buzz, love.
Vasmir, you have chosen to pay a visit at an extremely inopportune moment.
Well, coo-ee!
If I'd a known you was gonna have the gentry here, I would've worn my boiled shirt.
She's my niece too, coz.
That is something the entire family would prefer to forget.
Oh, dear.
Uncles, why do you not shake hands?
And I am the seventh son of the eldest son, ain't I?
Every family has its black sheep.
Which makes it me boundin' duty to put the okay on Jeannie's future hubby, don't it?
Does it?
No!
That is the duty of the eldest son of the seventh son: Me!
Not in my racing chart.
It's the seventh son of the eldest son, yours truly.
You old pickled son of a wall-eyed codfish.
Uncle Vasmir, please!
Looks better that way, don't it?
Don't you mouth your lower-class epithets at me, you parvenu!
Oh, uncles, you're being silly.
All right, so that's the way it is, is it?
All right, five rounds, and the winner gets to approve Jeannie's hubby.
Nothing would give me greater pleasure.
The Marquis of Queensbury, of course.
Uncles, uncles, please.
You are being ridiculous.
This is so silly!
Please, my master will be home any instant, and And then you will both see what a wonderful man he is.
Jeannie, I'm home.
Hey, did you see this article in the paper about me?
Huh?
You rotten Oh!
Oh, master!
Well, he may be wonderful, but he can't take a punch, can he?
Oh, uncles, look what you have done!
Oh, master.
This is terrible!
Now see here, coz.
You made her cry.
Oh, Jeannie, forgive me.
I forgot myself.
Look, we're making it up.
No hard feelings, coz.
Mmm.
Oh, oh, he is waking up.
Oh, poor master.
Darling, sweet little master.
Argh.
I'm afraid his state of consciousness is somewhat premature.
Oh!
Uncle Azmire!
And now, Vasmir, kindly vanish.
Jeannie and I have the approval of her future husband to discuss.
Not without me, you ain't.
It's me what gets to say thumbs down or thumbs up.
What you say is of no account.
By order of the Great Djinn, it is the eldest son of the seventh son.
As it so happens, I was with the Great Djinn last night in Monte Carlo.
Heh, heh, heh.
Broke the bank, he did.
And he says to me, "Vasmir," he says, "You go approve of Jeannie's future husband".
Me and the Great Djinn is like that.
Hm.
Jeannie, I warn you.
I shall be very severe.
I shall not allow my favorite niece to get married to a man who is not a true gentleman.
Well, I'm certainly not gonna let you get spliced to a stuffy cove like him.
Well, how in the world is my master ever going to please both of you?
Mm, uh, please who?
Sorry, guv.
We ain't quite ready for you yet.
Oh!
How are you going to approve of him if you do not let him wake up?
Because he may not know that he is being investigated.
Right.
For once.
We always does it incommunicado.
He means incognito.
But he's already seen both of you.
Well, I can fix that easy enough.
I'll put him back outside.
He won't even remember a thing.
Now, you go on just as usual, and I'll be taking notes.
And so will I.  Uncle, uncle, wh-what will happen if you do not approve of him?
Oh, don't worry, my dear.
You won't have to face an unpleasant scene.
I'll simply get rid of him.
Get rid of him?
Oh, but Uncle, I   Jeannie, I'm home!
Oh!
A true gentleman who is not stuffy.
Oh, dear.
Good evening, master.
Hi, Jeannie.
Oh, hello, duchess.
Uh, there's a wonderful article 'Allo, darlin', how about giving us a little buzz?
Ow, my jaw.
Wow.
Oh, hey, uh, there's a Huh?
Oh, what is the matter, master?
Oh, I don't know.
I guess I've been working too hard.
Boy, what a day, huh?
Hey, there's a great article in here by Dr. Bell Ah, don't do that!
What is it?
A gentleman does not put his feet on the furniture.
Huh?
What, are you kidding?
Yes, that is right, master.
I am kidding.
Because you are such a A fun, non-stuffy person to be with.
Poo-poo-pee-do.
What, are you having an attack of schizophrenia or something?
What's the matter with you?
Oh, that is funny, master.
Oh-ho-ho.
You are truly a card.
Uh, okay, I give up.
What's going on?
It is time to dress for dinner, master.
Dress Not until you What do you mean, dress for dinner?
I'm not gonna A true gentleman always dresses for dinner.
Heh, I think.
You're kidding.
I'm perfectly happy with what I got on.
At least I was.
Now, shall we go in?
Oh, well.
Ahh.
Oh, well, that's great.
Sensational, as a matter of fact.
Oh.
Sorry, your ladyship.
Oh, that is good, master.
That is very good.
Hey, this looks sensational.
Well, are we gonna eat or just admire the table?
Uh, well, of course we are going to eat.
Fish and chips, love.
Dig in.
Fish and chips for a formal dinner?
Wow!
Oh!
Oh, my goodness, you are right.
Huh?
Oh, well, that's better.
Mmm, mmm, good!
Mmm!
Well, Roger, it was really weird.
All night long, Jeannie kept switching back and forth between the Duchess of Windsor and a ladies' roller derby.
Well, maybe she's turned into a youthful rebel searching for her identity.
She's a genie.
That's her identity.
Oh, and this morning This morning just as I was leaving she said, "Remember, master, if anybody happens to ask you, just tell them that you're a non-stuffy gentleman".
Well, what do you make of that?
I wouldn't worry about the gentleman part.
But I wonder if she'd settle for a semi-stuffy?
Roger, no, I mean about Jeannie.
What do you think about her?
Well, for a gal who won't blink her master's best friend a million dollars, I'd say she's okay.
Roger, you're worthless.
Well, not if I had a million dollars.
I better get this to Dr. Bellows.
All right.
Which one of you blokes is Major Nelson?
Uh, oh, I am, sir.
May I help you?
Oh, I hope so, guv.
I hope so.
Ah, care to buy a couple of sweepstake tickets?
Oh, uh, no, no.
Thank you very much.
No?
No, "Thank you very much.
May I help you"?
Being a bit formal, ain't you?
Uh, listen, sir, about those sweepstake tickets, maybe I Now, you stay out of this, guv.
It's him I'm interested in.
Yeah.
Well, mate, buying or not?
Oh, no, no, thanks.
Oh, no, thanks.
Not a bettin' man, eh?
I was afraid of that.
Care for a little drinky once in a while?
Well, y Uh, par-pardon me.
Did anybody issue you a pass when you came on?
When you come onto a NASA base, you're supposed to have a pass, see.
Stickler for details.
Worse and worse.
Oh, uh, Major Nelson, I'd like to talk to you about Oh, excuse me.
I-I didn't know you were busy.
Oh, that That's all right, sir.
I was just about to call a security guard.
This gentleman doesn't have a pass.
Then what's he doing in you office?
Selling sweepstake tickets.
All right!
You're bending the coat.
All right, I'll take care of it.
Uh, sir Come along.
I wanted to talk to you about the plans here.
I'll see you in my office in 10 minutes.
Oh, uh, Major Healey, give me a hand.
I'm warning you guys.
I'm here on very important business.
All right, now This way, sir.
I'd certainly like to know how you slipped past the security guards.
I have me methods.
Listen, I heard Major Nelson call you a doc.
That's right, Dr. Bellows is the NASA psychiatrist.
Major Healey, that's none of his business.
A shrink?
You can't call Dr. Bellows a shrink, sir.
I mean, a shrink is not exactly I mean  Sergeant, see that this man leaves the base, and be sure that he's not allowed back in.
Yes, sir.
Not me, sergeant.
Him.
What cheek these bloomin' gatecrashers have.
What am I doing in these clothes?
You know, I never realized it before, but you two look an awful lot alike.
Sergeant, let me go.
I have no time to discuss it further, mate.
Take him away, sergeant major.
Sorry about those tickets.
I would've bought a couple of 'em.
Major Healey, wait!
I don't know what security on this base is coming to.
That man doesn't have a pass either.
Well, h-how do you know, sir?
I'm a psychiatrist, ain't I?
Isn't that "aren't I", sir?
Get rid of him.
Right-o.
Now to find me office, and that Major Anthony "Stuffy" Nelson.
Now then, guv.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I mean, uh, Major Nelson, what was it you wanted to see me about?
Oh, yes, sir.
It's about the plans.
The, uh, service-propulsion system.
The nozzle Uh, yes, of course.
Uh, care to find the pea?
The pea?
Oh, is that some new psychological test?
No, it's not a test.
It's a game of skill, and eye and hand coordination.
You put up a quid, I put up a quid.
A quid?
Oh, I mean dollar.
You guess where the pea is, you win.
Come on, mate.
Have a go.
Ha-ha.
Are you feeling all right, sir?
I never felt better.
Of course.
I know.
You're a Yank.
I'll bet your game is craps.
Here we go, here we go.
Well, I-I didn't know you were a gambling man.
That's all you know.
Here we go.
Seven come 11.
Give me points five.
Five is me point.
How much of the action you want?
Uh, Dr. Bellows, would you like to lie down for a couple minutes?
In the middle of the day?
I never hit the kip until 3 in the morning.
Don't tell me you take naps too.
Poor Jeannie.
Yeah, well, uh, uh, um A nap might not be a bad idea.
Say, I know what you need.
A little pick-me-up, eh, chum?
Eh?
No, no, I No, I don't need any medicine, sir.
Here we are.
Some of Scotland's best.
You, uh, keep liquor in your file cabinet, sir?
What do you think I keep, files?
You aren't exactly a bundle of laughs, are you, major?
You You just stay right here, sir.
You stay here.
Don't leave the place, and relax.
I'll be right back.
See here.
Who outranks who?
You outrank me, sir, of course.
Then you stay put, and that's an order.
Queen and country.
Sergeant, I demand that you let me back in.
I'm sorry, mister, you haven't got a pass.
And you heard Colonel Bellows.
But I am Colonel Bellows!
Uh-huh.
Ah.
Sergeant, look.
I'll prove it to you.
Here's my driver's license.
Sorry, mister.
I'm not interested.
Uh sergeant!
S Sergeant!
Well, you're gonna have to leave, sir, unless you have a pass.
Young man, kindly leave me alone.
I have important business with Major Nelson.
Sir, I don't want to use any force, but I'm under Dr. Bellows' orders.
And who is Dr. Bellows' superior officer?
General Schaeffer, but he's a busy man, sir.
Then I shall talk to him.
Sir, wait a minute, sir.
Oh, Major Healey.
Oh, excuse me, general.
I'm following someone.
A secretary, no doubt.
I'm leaving the base for a half an hour.
I'll be at the barber shop.
Yes, sir.
Where, where, where?
Oh, he's so fat too.
Where'd he go?
Oh, Major Healey.
Yes, sir, I thought you were going to the barber shop, sir.
I changed my mind.
Uh, find Major Nelson.
Send him to me immediately.
Oh, sure, but about this man I'm following.
Oh, forget him.
He's a close personal friend of mine.
Marvelous chap.
Uh, pukka sahib.
Pukka sahib?
Pukka sahib.
Pukka sahib.
Yes, sir, yes, sir.
Ah!
His office does not answer?
Oh, no, no, no, no.
That is all right.
Heh.
I will call later.
Oh, dear.
I wish I knew if my uncles have approved of him yet.
The suspense is terrible.
I've got a lovely bunch Of coconuts Here they are Standing in a row Come on, mate.
Sing along!
Here, give it a try.
I-I'd really rather not, sir.
Oh, you don't gamble, you don't drink, and you don't sing.
Yeah.
I don't understand what's come over you.
Come in.
General Schaeffer wants to see you in his office.
Uh, you can tell General Schaeffer to wait.
Listen, he's flipped.
He flipped.
I'm gonna go tell Schaeffer.
You stay here and stall.
Come on, major.
Wait, I'm not through.
Oh.
Hi, Dr. Bellows.
Hi.
Nice looking hat.
Hm.
Ah.
Oh, uh, doctor, why don't you just, uh, take it easy and I'll, uh I'll play the uke and you can sing.
Yeah.
Wh-what would you like to sing?
Um, "I've Got A Lovely Bunch of Coconuts".
Ah, yeah.
"Lovely Bunch of Coconuts" Yeah.
I've got a lovely bunch Of coconuts Here they are Standing in a row Big ones, small ones Some as big as your head Uh, General Schaeffer.
Dr. Bellows, what are you doing out there and in And in those clothes?
Sir, they won't let me back on the base.
Well, in that outfit, I should think not.
I-I mean, mod is one thing, but Sir, I don't know what happened.
One minute I was escorting this man without a pass off the base, and the next thing I knew, I was wearing his clothes, and they were throwing me off.
Well, all right, doctor, all right.
Calm down.
I'll get you back in and then we can find out what's going on.
Oh, uh, thank you, sir.
Oh, and, uh, doctor, do you mind walking a few feet behind me?
I have my reputation to think of.
No, no, you don't understand, general.
Uh, Dr. Bellows has gone right over the edge.
Oh, and you don't approve of what's going on, eh?
Good.
Ha, ha.
Good.
Well, sir, it It's not my position to approve or disapprove.
It's just that I-I think that he needs help.
Concerned for fellow officers.
Excellent.
Well, if you don't mind my saying so, this is really not the time to make notes.
Dr. Bellows might get violent any moment.
Uh, uh, now look here, Major Nelson Nelson.
Nelson.
That's an old name.
Are you by any change descended from Admiral Horatio Nelson of Trafalgar?
Trafalgar?
Master?
Ma?
Oh, hm.
Perhaps in Dr. Bellows' office.
I've got a lovely bunch Of coconuts Halt!
Hold it.
Which one?
Too bad.
Ah, tell me, Roge.
How long is this Schaeffer cove gonna keep Major Nelson?
Vasmir!
Ooh!
Uh, long enough for me to win my money back, I hope.
All right, here we go.
Hm!
Hold it.
Hold it.
Which one?
Ah That one there.
Close that time, mate.
Close that time.
Let me see.
You know, it's a ruddy shame that Major Nelson is not more like you.
If there's anything that gets me gander up, it's stuffiness.
Well, he's not stuffy, sir.
He's just that way around you.
Actually, he's never seen the sporting side of you.
Ha, ha.
Hold it!
Hold it.
You know, I'm glad to hear you say that.
Ah, you being his friend and all, I'm gonna take your word for it.
Which one?
This one, this one.
Yeah.
You know, chum, it's been a bloomin' pleasure doing business with you.
There's no pea under any of 'em!
Dr. Bellows?
Dr. Bellows The peas are gone and Dr. Bellows is gone.
No peas, no Dr. Bellows.
No relation to Horatio Nelson.
I'm, um, going to the infirmary to pick up some medication, sir.
Perhaps I should get something for you too.
Ah, just a moment, major.
I have decided that you are an officer and a gentleman, and I thoroughly approve of your marriage.
Ah!
Hooray, hooray!
I knew you could pass it, master.
I knew you could do it!
You did, you did!
Good day, Jeannie.
Congratulations.
How many times have I told you not to come in without knocking?
You'll have to excuse her, General Schaeffer.
Oh, master, this is not General Schaeffer.
This is my Uncle Azmire.
And he has just approved of our marriage.
Uh, she's been ill, sir.
I think what you both have is contagious.
I'm sorry for the masquerade, my boy, but when your General Schaeffer went to the barber shop, I took the liberty of impersonating him.
You're Uncle Azmire?
Why, you  And Dr. Bellows.
Who's Dr. Bellows?
Uncle Vasmir.
I am afraid you did not make a very favorable impression on him.
Well, we'll take care of that right now!
Oh, oh, master, wait!
Ah!
Ah!
Jeannie, ha-ha-ha, let him go.
I'd love to see Vasmir get a good bash.
Oh, shame.
Now you go in and lie down for a while, doctor.
When you're calmer, we'll discuss it again.
I suppose that would be best, sir.
Perhaps an explanation will occur to me.
Liquor?
On my desk?
All right, Vasmir, you've had it.
Major.
Major Nelson.
Why are you looking at me like that?
How dare you come in here Whiskey bottles and crap games!
Ukuleles!
When are you guys gonna learn not to foul up a man's life?
He's gone berserk.
Absolutely berserk!
Help!
Help!
You better blink out of here before I lose my temper!
Major Nelson, what are you doing?
Keep our of this, Azmire, before I really start on you.
Major Nelson!
Shut up!
The masquerade is o Er.
Jolly good, Nelson, jolly good.
But you can come out of it now.
Out of it.
Huh?
The experiment was a success, wouldn't you say?
Oh, right-o.
What experiments?
Who?
Who are you?
Oh, of course.
Silly of me.
General St. Regis-Tyne here, of Her Majesty's Army, on loan to your Pentagon.
This is Lieutenant Stebbens, drug research, you know.
Major Nelson volunteered.
Oh, he was very brave.
One whiff and you become a raving maniac.
One clap of the hands and you come out of it.
Clever, eh?
Well W-well, why weren't we informed?
Oh, sorry about that.
Hush-hush, you know.
Nelson!
Sir!
I'll see that you get the Victoria Cross for this.
Oh, the VC for me?
But that still doesn't explain about my clothes.
Perhaps you got a whiff by mistake, gov Sir.
Yes, of course.
That could be possible.
Yeah.
Excuse me sir, sir.
Dr. Bellows, I would like my $35 back.
What?
!
General Schaeffer, there's something I've gotta tell you about Dr. Bellows.
There isn't a pea under any of those things.
Is he drugged too?
Huh?
Roger, Roger, snap out of it!
Sir, I know this is hard to believe, but Dr. Bellows is running a shell game.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Oh, master.
I cannot believe that we are really going to be married.
It is like a dream.
No, it's not a dream, Jeannie.
It's really happening.
Mm-hm.
Would you do something for me?
Yeah, sure.
What?
Would you say "Mrs. Anthony Nelson"?
Mrs. Anthony Nelson.
Ooh.
Oh, that is so beautiful I cannot stand it.
Yeah.
Hey, listen, you gotta change.
We don't wanna be late for the rehearsal.
Oh.
Oh.
Ah.
Are you all right?
I I will hurry.
Did you order any more azaleas?
Please.
Please, everybody.
We must get started with this rehearsal.
Now, I've got a baptism at 11 and a funeral at noon.
Everything's gonna be all right, Reverend.
Well, now, is everybody here?
Well The bride, the groom, the best man Oh.
Where is Major Healey, Anthony?
Well, he knew this thing was gonna be at 10:00.
Well, uh, keep calm, everyone.
Don't worry.
I'll find him.
Oh, excuse me.
Matron of honor?
Oh yes, that's me.
I'm here.
The father of the bride?
Oh, uh, Dr. Bellows is gonna give the bride away, sir.
Well, is he here then?
Oh, well, he just went to get the best man.
Major Nelson, babies get cold if they're kept waiting.
All national magazines, major?
Well, that's marvelous.
We're all here now, Reverend.
Finally.
Now, then, Major Healey is the best man.
Uh, Major Healey.
I can't figure this out.
You know, I took this picture about an hour ago.
Yeah.
Well, it's supposed to be of the bride and groom, but, uh Well, the bride didn't come out.
Uh, let me see that.
That's peculiar.
We The purse is there, but no Jeannie.
Uh, may I see that, sir?
Oh, yes.
JEANNIE : Genies cannot be photographed.
Well Major Nelson.
What are you doing?
It wasn't a very good liking, sir.
No pictures?
What are you gonna show your grandchildren?
Shh.
Roger.
She doesn't photograph.
She doesn't photograph?
You mean she's not photogenic?
That's a heck of a thing to say at your wedding.
No.
She just doesn't come out.
You saw that picture.
That is right, Major Healey.
It is one of the few disadvantages of being a genie.
Oh, what am I gonna tell the reporters and photographers?
You're not telling 'em.
I'm gonna tell 'em.
No photographers and that's it.
Now, let's get this rehearsal over with.
Oh.
Hi.
Uh, Major Healey.
No pictures, no pictures.
No pictures?
Well, you can take one of me later in my uniform.
And now, folks, if I may have your Dr. Bellows.
Why are you shouting?
We're the only ones here.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Uh, the Reverend Weems, uh, asked me to tell you that he had to leave to perform the baptism.
And he asked me, uh, to take over the rehearsal.
Uh, now.
Amanda, you just stand right where you are.
'Course I'll stay right here.
This is where he told me to stand.
Amanda, what's the matter?
Nothing's the matter with me?
I always cry at weddings.
But this isn't the wedding.
It's only a rehearsal.
May Maybe she's rehearsing her crying.
But, it's rather ridiculous Well, there you are.
You can have all the rehearsal shots you could want.
Oh, uh Uh, sir.
The photographers Hold it just like that.
Major Nelson.
It's a camera, not a shotgun.
These gentlemen are from the national magazines.
No, no, no.
Why can't we have a little?
Please, no one  Uh.
Could I have that, please?
Thank you.
Can I speak to you, sir?
No, no.
No No photograph.
But I insist on it.
Yes.
Sir.
Uh, uh No photographers, please.
Please, no photographers.
We We made an agreement.
Major Nelson, Jeannie, you're both obviously upset.
Now, l-let's have it.
It's the photographers, sir.
We don't want any.
We don't want any pictures taken at all.
No.
That is right, general.
I I-I am camera shy.
Yeah.
Oh, Jeannie, I I understand how you feel.
Believe me.
You'd like a simple, intimate wedding.
But an astronaut is a public figure, and the press is entitled to cover this marriage.
Sir, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to insist.
It's a personal matter.
Major.
It's out of my hands.
Major Healey cleared these people with the Pentagon, and they'd scream blue murder if I tried to throw them out.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to make the best of it.
Oh, sorry.
No pictures.
Oh, master, what are we going to do?
I'd like to elope.
That is an excellent idea.
Honey, wait a minute.
Uh.
Jeannie.
What are you doing?
We're eloping, master, just as you said.
It will only take me a minute to pack.
Wait a minute.
I said I might like to elope.
I I We can't.
It's too late.
But everyone is so busy.
And they are all nervous.
And you're worried about photographers.
And this is all wrong.
Hey, hey.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
No sense in crying about it.
Come here.
What's all this?
You don't have to cry.
Yes, I do.
Oh, look, I know exactly how you feel.
You do?
Of course I do.
Uh, you've got what they call, um, pre-wedding jitters.
That's all.
Ev It's indigenous to brides.
It's kind of a tradition.
But I wanted our wedding to be so beautiful and simple.
Beautiful?
Oh, sure.
But simple, darling, never.
You see, the trouble with weddings is, the The bride and groom don't count.
Well then it's why we should elope.
So we can go someplace where we can be alone.
Aw.
We're gonna have the rest of our lives alone together.
Now, let's just figure today, that's for everybody else.
All our friends and relations will come and wish us luck.
Give us their congratulations and their confidence.
And after all, how would Roger, and Dr. and Mrs. Bellows feel if we just ran off?
Oh, that is exactly what we have done.
They must be looking all over for us.
Let 'em look a little longer.
It won't hurt 'em.
This is much more important.
You see, I don't care where I marry you.
A parachute.
Madison Square Garden.
Or Westminster Abby.
Because I love you.
You believe that?
Oh, yes, master, I do.
Mm.
Don't call me master.
Call me Tony.
Yes, An Anthony.
I I do.
All right.
You remember that "I do" for the ceremony.
It'll really come in handy.
Shall we get on with the wedding?
Oh, yes.
Darling, yes.
Yes.
You know, you were right.
It could've been a lot worse.
Yeah?
How?
Well my mother could've decided to come.
Oh.
Master.
What?
What about the photographers?
You'll just have to blink the cameras.
Blink the cameras.
I can't find them anywhere.
We'll have to go along without them.
Amanda, can't you look over Sir, uh, can we get along with the rehearsal?
Uh, Jeannie's Oh, there you are.
Yes.
I think we'd try to muddle our way through.
Major Nelson, would you kindly go over there and stand next to Major Healey.
Uh Uh, Jeannie, you and I have to march down the center aisle over here.
Now, try not to be nervous, sir.
That was so beautiful.
Mrs. Bellows, will you please stop crying?
Oh Give me my handkerchief back.
All right, folks.
Let's continue.
Amanda.
You're first.
Over here.
Oh, uh, Jeannie, you come along with me.
Now, uh, let's see.
Here, Alfred?
Right there, yes.
You ready, dear?
Yes, I'm fine.
Mm-hm.
Dum, dum, da-dum Dum, dum, da-dum Dum, dum, da-dum Where'd you go?
Jeannie's bottle.
Yeah, well, you should've stayed there.
Boy, this is getting to be weird around here.
Now, Jeannie.
Left?
Yes, left.
Left.
Dum, dum, da-dum Dum, dum, da-dum Dum, da-dum My camera.
What happened to my camera?
Shh.
What happened to my camera?
Dum, dum, da-dum Da, da-da Well, there you are, gentlemen.
Dum, dum, da-dum Dum, dum, da-dum Ooh!
Dum Oh.
What the?
What's going on here?
MAN 2: What happened?
MAN 3: I don't know.
Well, fellas, can't you fix it while we Well, let's start again.
Now, wait I don't think it's gonna work.
I was never so frightened.
I just don't think it's gonna work.
An anti-photo phaser that destroys cameras automatically?
Oh, well.
Uh, after all, gentlemen, uh, this room is normally used for top-secret conferences.
You couldn't expect NASA to To have any unauthorized photographs taken in here, could you, general?
Uh, yes.
Yes, of course.
We're very careful about security here.
Why wasn't I told about this?
I'll square it with you later.
You'd better.
Yeah, that's just swell.
But how are we supposed to take pictures of a wedding when our cameras keep exploding?
A good question.
I'm glad you asked.
We don't have time for this rehearsal.
I'm sorry.
See, the wedding is in three hours, I have to do Jeannie's hair.
Darling, I'm sorry.
All right, Amanda.
Oh, uh, excuse me, gentlemen.
Did I miss anything?
Uh, yes.
The anti-photo phaser kept, uh, exploding the cameras.
Will you go turn it off, please?
Yes, sir.
Oh, uh, where is it, sir?
Oh, Major Nelson will show you.
Oh.
Well, Tony, let's go and turn it off.
Now, don't worry, gentlemen.
NASA will make full restitution for your cameras.
You can have all the pictures you want.
Oh, uh let's say back here at 2:30.
Sounds good.
That's all right.
You know, general, really It seems to me that   Oh, hello, Mrs. Bellows.
I'd like to speak to Jeannie in private.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
Bad luck for the groom to see the bride before the ceremony.
It might be worse luck if he doesn't.
Fellas She's gonna see you at the altar, not before.
I'm very sorry.
Excuse me.
Ma'am.
Terribly sorry about that.
Oh.
Oh, well, he doesn't give up easily, does he?
Well, perhaps if I explained to him.
No, you don't, my dear.
You are going to go in the kitchen and wait, and I will But Go ahead.
Major Nelson, really, if you keep interrupting Oh.
Whoa.
Whoa.
What is it?
Oh, what is it?
What is it?
Yeah.
Oh, well, uh Uh Uh, Tony Tony's in the car.
He, uh I, uh Oh, forgot the studs for his shirt.
For heaven's sake, come in and get them.
The way things are going, I'll never get Jeannie ready.
Mrs. Bellows!
What?
Oh, Mrs. Bellows.
Uh, the, uh They're They're The studs are in the bedroom.
What, do you want me to help you get them?
For heaven's sake.
Jeannie.
That's a closet.
Yeah.
That's a closet.
Too Too small for a bedroom.
Ha-ha.
Huh.
Studs weren't there anyway.
Major, you have been in this house a thousand times.
Now, I am losing my patience.
The bedroom is right behind us.
Fine, fine.
Both brown doors.
Oh.
Don't worry, Jeannie.
It was only It was only Major Healey.
See, your fiancÃ© forgot his studs.
Oh, listen, I haven't told you.
I-I I want to thank you very much for letting me be your matron of honor.
I've been a bridesmaid many times, never a matron of honor.
I guess, always a bridesmaid, never a matron of honor, huh?
Oh, you know, your fiancÃ© is really a wonderful man, and I'm sure you're both going to be very happy together.
But I tell you, I really hate to say this Tell you what.
I'm gonna put this cushion here.
It'll be easier for me to work.
Would you sit against the cushion?
Now, let's see what we can do with that.
Well, getting back to Alfred, I mean, there are worse things than being stuffy and conservative.
Yes, Mrs. Bellows.
That is true.
There must be something.
Some potion you can drink, some incantation.
There is nothing.
Genies simply cannot be photographed.
Oh, that's great.
I'll explain that to the photographers.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Hey, you look great.
Little Little too much pancake.
Major Healey, she's a little uptight right now.
Yes, she does look a little stiff.
Oh, I found the, uh Found the studs.
They were in the closet after all.
Master.
I have it.
Watch.
Look.
I don't get it.
I can make the dummy look exactly like me.
It can be photographed.
You can marry it.
Forget it.
I can't marry a dummy.
It wouldn't be legal.
Oh.
I did not think of that.
That's it.
I'll insist on no photographs during the actual ceremony.
Oh, master, you are brilliant.
Jeannie, blink me out of here.
Yes, master.
Well, uh nice talking to you.
Uh, come on, Roge.
We're gonna be late.
Yeah!
Coming.
Got your studs.
That was nice.
The studs were in your closet.
Uh, Major Healey.
Oh, Major Healey.
Listen.
How about getting me a good place to stand?
I don't want to have to compete with those national magazines.
Well, maybe I can find you a place behind the flowers, but, uh, no No taking pictures during the ceremony.
Oh, I don't even have my camera.
Yeah?
Well, what's that?
Oh, this is my typewriter.
Well, no typing during the ceremony.
I'll bet you're proud of your son today, Mr. and Mrs. Nelson.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Jeannie's a beautiful girl.
Poor child.
She's absolutely rigid.
Oh.
I am watching my own wedding, and it is beautiful.
Jeannie, what's the matter?
Ooh.
Relax, Jeannie.
It's going beautifully.
Join hands, please.
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here to join this man and this woman in holy wedlock.

I do.

Alfred, what is that?
What is that?
I thought we were gonna see Major Nelson's wedding.
What is that?
It's the most peculiar I I don't understand it.
I had that film developed myself.
Let me see.
Major Nelson and Major Healey came by, we talked for a few minutes, and then You talked for a few minutes, and then you took the wrong film home.
Oh, Alfred, you're brilliant.
Just brilliant.
I'm going to bed.
I am exhausted.
I have had a day.
But, it couldn't have been.
I'll be right in.
Now, let me see.
You may kiss the bride.
There's a photographer taking pictures.
Oh, how nice.
Yeah.
Isn't it?
I I guess we didn't get married after all.
I mean, there's nobody there.
Oh, yes we did.
And I have the ring to prove it.

Uh, he must have an awful lot of, uh, animal magnetism.
Even Amanda is twitterpated.
Oh, I didn't know Amanda was a twitterpated, sir.
Well, what made you come back to the Air Force and give up auto racing?

Um, especially when their husbands are away so often.
Yes, sir.

Thank you.
Well, that's all right, but I didn't send 'em.
Uh-oh.
The flower shop said that you did.
Well, that's funny.
You know, master, I had the most peculiar conversation with Amanda Bellows today.
Yeah?
Mm.
Oh, uh, Jeannie, I've I've got to talk to you a minute.
Well, certainly, Major Healey.
Uh, in the kitchen.
I do all my serious talking in the kitchen.
Heh-heh.
Charming.
Heh.
If you're gonna ask her to blink something, forget it.
Oh.
It's not for me, old buddy.
It's for you.
Jeannie.
Um, I've got to talk to you.
You've got to break this thing up.
It's gonna bring you nothing but unhappiness.
Oh, Major Healey, what are you talking about?
Oh, you know what I'm talking about.
I know he's handsome and irresistible.
You gotta think about Tony.
What is the matter with my master?
Is he not well?
No, but he will be if he finds out, and he's gonna find out if you keep on with that crazy lie.
What a bad lie.
And those roses.
He knows he didn't send those.
Oh, Major Healey  Oh, excuse me.
Excuse me.
I must answer the doorbell.
Oh, no, forget about the door.
You've got thousands of years to fool around.
You can't fool around now.
But I know that, Major Healey.
A nice Nice genie like you.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Bellows, Dr. Bellows.
Major Nelson.
Hello, you poor, poor dear man.
Uh, major, we were in the neighborhood and Yeah.
Would you like to stay for dinner, sir?
Oh, no, thank you, major.
We're just on our way.
Alfred, now Of course we can stay for dinner, major.
Thank you asking us.
I mean, that is, if you, uh, think Jeannie can manage.
Oh, yeah, Jeannie can make it.
Uh Uh Hey, Jeannie!
The Bellows are gonna be staying for dinner.
Amanda, we shouldn't have come.
Nonsense, Alfred.
Now, listen to me.
I tried to speak to her this morning.
I really tried, dear.
But she just played dumb.
But it's none of our business.
Alfred, how can you say such a thing?
Major Nelson happens to be one of your finest officers, not to mention a very good friend.
Now, how can we just idly sit by and let him be deceived by that blond hussy?
But what if we made a mistake?
After all, we only saw them once.
It was very dark.
Alfred, you know what you saw just as well as I did.
Oh, no.
I'm not leaving this house until I have it out with Jeannie.
Amanda.
Oh, hi.
Oh.
Dr. and Mrs. Bellows, I am delighted that you can stay for dinner.
Jeannie, I'd like to speak with you, please.
Oh, certainly, Mrs. Bellows.
Um in the kitchen?
Yes, I'd like to see what you've got cooking.
All right.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
Uh, sure.
Excuse me.
Well, there seems to be a lot of conferencing going on in the kitchen.
Yeah.
Uh You all like a drink?
Oh, fine, major.
Fine.
My usual.
Yeah.
Fine, fine.
Usual.
Yeah, the usual.
What beautiful roses.
Oh, uh, s-sir.
Don't, uh Don't mention the roses.
Tony didn't send the roses.
I know that.
You mean, you're in on it too?
Doesn't anybody play it straight anymore?
Yes, I'm in on it.
Major Nelson seems to be the only one who isn't.
Yeah.
Oh, boy.
Hm.
Here you are!
Oh.
Thank you.
Here you are, sir.
Oh, I'll get it.
Roge.
Here, help yourself.
Oh.
I got it.
Oh, hi, Biff.
Oh, Tony.
You live here?
I'm beginning to wonder.
Come on in.
Well.
That's weird.
I-I I was supposed to meet somebody, and I had this address.
Major Healey!
What do you think you're doing?
I'm sorry, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
Boy, he moves right in, doesn't he?
Who moves right in?
Biff.
What colossal gall.
Like a little more soda, sir?
Oh, major.
Anthony, who's there?
Uh, Jeannie.
Anthony.
Biff, this is my wife, Jeannie.
Oh!
Oh, I am sorry.
Are you all right?
Oh, yes.
Heh.
Now, this is going to be an interesting evening.
You all right, darling?
Yeah.
Well it It is very nice to meet you.
Uh, can you stay for dinner?
Uh Uh, no.
Um, I'd better get going.
Wrong address.
But you just got here.
I will put another plate on.
Do not worry.
It is no trouble at all.
Will you look at her?
Cool as a cucumber.
You know, she denied everything in the kitchen.
Everything.
She said she didn't even know what I was talking about.
Uh Yeah.
And you can take this back.
See this?
I wouldn't date Brunhilda if she had five stars after her name.
There you are.
Oh.
Roses, huh?
That figures.
Say Uh, why don't you use the phone and find out what went wrong, huh?
No, I think I know what went wrong.
I'm sorry to bother you folks.
Yeah.
B  I I  Jeannie, what's the matter with you?
You're not supposed to pop in and out when people are here.
Oh, do not be such an old fuddy-duddy.
Fuddy-d Wha?
She's gone buggy along with everybody else.
Hey, I want to talk to you.
Oh, well.
I am very popular tonight.
Everybody wishes to talk to me.
In the kitchen.
Yeah.
Well, it looks like it's gonna be a fun evening with the Nelsons.
It does.
Uh, do you think he found out something?
Oh, he looked pretty mad.
Mm.
Boy, when he gets mad Uh, really mad.
Oh.
Darling over here.
Oh, it was torture, sweetheart, seeing you in there, and not being able to hug you and kiss you and Why didn't you tell me you were Major Nelson's wife?
Well, I was afraid that it might make a difference.
You bet your life it makes a difference.
We'll never see each other again.
Hm.
That's what you think, darling.
No.
We love each other.
That's all that matters.
Yes, darling.
Yes.
I thought you'd see it my way.
Are you gonna deny you called me a fuddy-duddy?
Master, I have been in this kitchen three times.
Once with Major Healey, once with Mrs. Bellows, and now with you.
And I-I fail to understand what any of you are talking about.
All right, uh, forget it.
Just don't go popping in and out in front of my guests, huh?
But I Shh!
Oh.
Alfred, she's shameless, And in her own house too.
But I distinctly saw her go into the kitchen with Major Nelson.
Well, there she is.
Tsk.
Oh.
Oh.
Heh.
Darling.
What are we gonna do?
Well, you're simply going to have to tell him.
You're right.
We have to tell him.
It's better that way.
Clean, honest.
Right, right, darling.
All that stuff.
Now you go around the front, and I'll meet you inside.
Now, darling, don't you worry.
Soon we won't have to hide our love in the shadows.
No, dear.
No, no, no.
Nincompoop.
I don't know what they all see in him.
For the last time, master, I did not call you a fuddy-duddy, and I did not pop out.
Jeannie, I saw you.
Well you do not see me anymore.
Now, will you stop that?
Oh.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry.
I She's not here.
No, she isn't, is she?
Would you like some, uh, hors d'oeuvres, sir?
M Mrs. Bellows, have you seen Jeannie by any?
Uh, no!
No, I haven't, major.
I thought she was with you.
Uh, no.
Roger, would you give me a hand looking for Jeannie?
She popped out on me.
Jeannie!
Oh, Jeannie.
Jeannie!
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Jeannie, Jeannie.
Now, major, really.
You don't honestly expect to find her in a drawer, do you?
Yeah.
Drawer, that's very silly.
Well, of course it's silly.
That's why I said it.
She's probably in the pencil box.
She's Uh, excuse me.
Mrs. Bellows.
Dr. Bellows.
Uh Amanda.
What?
You were right.
Uh, Jeannie wasn't in the kitchen.
Oh, well, thank you for telling me, dear.
You'll be very happy to know that she's not in the pencil box either.
Uh, Jeannie, if you're up there, will you please come down?
I'm sorry.
Oh, uh Oh, hi, Biff.
I thought you'd gone.
Uh, Tony Uh I mean, Major Nelson.
I want to talk to you.
Can't it wait just a second?
I got to talk to my wife.
Well, that's what I want to talk to you about.
You see, Jeannie and I No, no, no, no, no.
Don't say it.
Hey.
Why, uh You all have been acting cockeyed all e Would somebody please tell me what's going on around here?
Psst.
Master, I am sorry too.
Come down.
It's okay, Tony, I got her!
What are you so mad about?
He's the one that should be mad.
Let go of me, you idiot!
You'll spoil everything.
Get out!
Jeannie, for heaven's sake What's going on here?
Yeah, what's going on?
W I wish Anthony!
Yes?
Yeah.
I am leaving you.
Honey, what are you saying?
I'm afraid that's true, Nelson.
We didn't plan it that way, we didn't mean it to happen, but that's the way it is.
Wh You can't leave me.
I love you.
Hey.
Hey, hey.
Let her go.
You stay out of this, you bounder!
Say that you Say you didn't mean that.
No, Anthony.
I am leaving you, and that is final.
Okay.
Get in there.
Go on.
That's a closet you just put her in.
Shh.
Shh.
That's where disobedient wives go, Mrs. Bellows.
Be quiet in there!
Don't you think that's a little rough?
Rough?
It's positively medieval.
I can see now why she's leaving you.
Now, see here, Nelson.
I felt bad about this before, but not anymore.
You're some kind of monster.
Now, get out of the way.
Jeannie!
Let me out!
Oh, great heavens!
He's going to pieces!
Oh.
I can't stand to see a grown man cry.
I've got it, Jeannie.
Oh, yes, master.
And it is brilliant.
Nelson, I'm warning you.
Roger, get the door.
Yeah.
Not this door, you idiot.
That door.
Hi.
Hi, Biff, honey.
Where you been?
Jeannie?
But you're in there.
Jeannie?
Oh, no, no.
My name's Janine.
Gee, it's a nice place you got here.
Uh, but Oh, I guess you mean the girl that lives here.
Yeah, well, sometimes we do look an awful lot alike.
As long as I'm wearing my wig.
Heh-heh.
Wig?
Yeah, and my girdle.
Oh, boy.
They sure do the job, don't they, honey?
Huh.
Gee, Biff, I waited and waited for you, and then Then I noticed the car was parked at the curb in front of this house, and I thought, "Oh, he got the wrong address".
Uh, you mean, you're the girl I met the other night?
Yeah.
Under the tree at the Bellows'?
Heh.
I crashed your party 'cause I heard that, uh, there'd be a lot of eligible males there.
And I found one.
Uh, well Well, I I just remembered I have an important engagement back at the, uh, base, don't I, Dr. Bellows?
Uh Uh, we'll make it some other time.
Uh, sorry, Tony.
Sorry, everybody.
Hey!
Wait a minute!
You said you loved me.
Oh, boy.
But I really don't understand, you see, because I saw them kissing outside your window.
Oh, good heavens, Amanda.
You're probably seeing things again.
Alfred, are you gonna stand there and tell me that I didn't hear Jeannie tell him that she was leaving him?
Now, what about that?
Yeah, what about that?
Oh, yeah.
She said that, all right.
Uh, but I'm I'm a little embarrassed to tell you.
Oh, why don't you try?
Well, you know how young wives are about unexpected guests coming for dinner.
Well, Roger came, and then you came.
She got a little upset, that's all.
Oh, for heaven sakes.
I knew we shouldn't have come.
Oh, I'm terrible sorry, Major Nelson.
Wait a minute, major.
You mean, for that, you locked her in the closet?
I didn't.
This is her favorite place to be when she's mad at me.
Oh, Amanda.
Please Ha-ha.
Figure that one out.
Well, I'm leaving.
Yes.
Don't worry, Alfred.
And when I get home, I'm going in the closet.
This jazz about the closet being Jeannie's favorite place to hide when she's mad is all right for Dr. Bellows, but don't you think we should let her out?
I can't.
It's, uh Jeannie's sister.
And I know exactly what to do with her.
Oh.
Master.
Oh.
Dear.
There.
Now we will be able to put her someplace where she cannot cause any more trouble.
Oh.
You mean, your sister's in there?
Yeah.
That is right.
Oh, that's terrific.
Heh.
So are my uniforms.
Oh, boy.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Ah.
Jeannie!
Hi, Tony.
Hey, what are you doing?
We tee off in 20 minutes.
Roger, would you help me with this window?
Ah, here, wait.
I got it.
I got it.
I got it.
Here.
Oh.
It's a little hard to get.
Ow!
Oh.
It's my fault.
I'm sorry.
My fault.
Sorry.
Oh.
Yeah, um, I got it.
Hey, what's with the clothes?
We're supposed to play golf today.
Oh, I'm sorry, Roge.
I forgot all about it.
I told Jeannie I'd I'd help her around the house today.
Uh, golf takes three or four hours, you know.
Yeah.
Three or four hours.
Uh How about going over to the club?
We'll play a little gin.
I can't, Roge.
I promised Jeannie I'd take her to lunch today.
Jeannie.
You Why don't you join us?
No, no.
I'm, uh, not hungry.
I had lunch yesterday.
Oh.
Well, I don't suppose you'd like to go over and knock a few tennis balls around?
Uh, Roge, I can't.
I told Jeannie I'd take her shopping after.
Hey, listen, why don't we, uh, set a whole day aside, huh?
Next Saturday?
And we'll spend the whole day together?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Saturday's fine.
I better get over to the tennis court.
It's, uh It gets busy this time of day.
Uh I You, uh It's on the inside.
You gotta get your hand all the way up in there.
Saturday, yes.
Master?
Yah!
You have to get your hand up in there.
Oh.
Thanks.
Is something the matter?
Uh, well, it's It's Roge.
I forgot our golf game today.
And then he wanted me to play gin rummy with him, and I told him I'm gonna take you to lunch and, well, you know Aw.
Well, you should have asked him to come with us.
Yeah, I did.
But I had the feeling he thought he was intruding or something, you know.
I should've taken off an hour to play a little tennis with him, you know.
Well, there's nothing to worry about.
There's plenty of people to play with.
It's always crowded on the courts this time of day.
Mm-hm.
Oh.
Oh, thanks.
You have to reach your hand up inside there.
Hm?
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh!
Oh.
Beautiful.
Beautiful serve.
Two out of three.
Okay.
My serve.
Well, the fact is, Roger and I are just not as close as we used to be.
We used to do everything together, but now that I'm married, you know, it's just Well, why does not Major Healey get married?
Ha-ha.
Roger get married?
Yes.
Never in a million years.
Too much fun being single.
I beg your pardon, master.
Uh I mean, for Roger, it's too much fun being single.
Well, you know Roger.
He has a different girl every night.
Brunettes, blonds, redheads.
You know.
And that is what you call fun?
Hm.
Men.
If Major Healey is having so much fun, why does he have no one to be with today, hm?
Yeah, well it'd be great if Roger got married, but well, the girl would have to really be something special.
Perfect.
Not many perfect girls left around.
I got the last one.
Oh, master, that was sweet of you.
You know, maybe I could ask Mama about a girl.
She has a lot of lovely ladies No, no, no, no.
I don't want you to do anything.
Now, one genie in Cocoa Beach is quite sufficient.
All right, master.
I wonder where one does find the perfect girl?
Mrs. Nelson, the man you've described on your questionnaire just doesn't exist.
He's too perfect.
Oh.
Well, that is why he needs the perfect mate.
Let's see: An astronaut.
Handsome, charming, intelligent, warm, sensitive.
Tell me, Mrs. Nelson, if this Major Healey is so extra-special terrific, why does he have to come to a computer service to find a girl?
Oh, well, he does not know about this.
It is my idea.
Mm.
I see.
Well, let's give it a whirl.
Ooh.
What a marvelous machine.
So scientific.
Oh.
There you are.
What is the girl's name?
Laverne Sadelko.
Oh.
Laverne Sadelko.
Mm-hm.
Well.
Where can I find this Laverne Sadelko?
Oh, that is you.
But that That is you.
Well you can't argue with a computer.
Where do we find him?
My niece, Patricia, is visiting us for a few days, and, uh, I want her to have a good time.
Oh, she'd have a good time with Major Healey.
You see, she's been very carefully brought up, and I don't want her exposed to anyone too, uh Too wild.
So I ask again, is Major Healey a gentleman?
Um w-well, I I I I saw his commission.
It says he's a gentleman on the Good.
On your recommendation then, I'll entrust him Oh, no, my Not my recommendation, sir.
Now, I want you to arrange an accidental, uh Uh, meeting, uh, without letting her know that I had anything to do with it.
You know how shy some girls can be.
Shy?
Oh, e Excuse me.
Uh Uh, just a moment.
Uh, uh, yes.
Uh, quiet, demure, respectful.
An old-fashioned girl.
Could we talk about this, sir?
Sir?
Would you send the congressman in, please?
Sir Please, major, will you take care of that for me?
Oh, yeah.
And bring the files.
Old-fashioned?
Yeah.
This is the swingingest place in Cocoa Beach?
Oh, well, it starts swinging a little later here.
Wrong.
It starts swinging now.
Give me a quarter.
Huh?
A quarter?
There you are.
Ha, ha, ha, yeah.
You know, you're You're not, like At all like General Schaeffer described you.
Oh, I suppose he gave you that "shy, quiet, demure, old-fashioned" line, huh?
Oh, yeah.
Well, it's useful for the over-30s to think that.
Honey, the only thing I'm old-fashioned about is old fashions.
Oh.
I'll have one, please.
And what will you have, sir?
Uh, ginger ale, please.
That figures.
Uh, listen, when am I going to have my accidental meeting?
Accidental meeting?
Oh, come on.
Every time I arrange to visit my uncle, he arranges for me to meet some loser accidentally.
The last one proposed after an hour and a half.
And you turned him down?
Me?
Get married?
It's too much fun being single.
Back home I go out with a different date every night.
Blonds, brunets, redheads.
Yeah.
You and Major Healey are gonna get along pretty well, you know.
Hm.
He's a loser, huh?
Yeah.
Where is he?
I don't know.
He said he's gonna be here.
Um Uh, you sit tight, I'll I'll go look for him.

Don't be silly, major.
That's Patricia's voice.
No, uh Sir.
Wait a minute.
What's so dumb about it?
All I said was, "Take off the mustache before I kiss you".
What's wrong with that?
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
Oh.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
What, uh?
All right, don't anybody panic.
It's just a fuse that blew.
Get that mustache off her, understand?
Off.
Major Nelson.
But, Patricia, dear, I saw the mustache.
Well, then, you're just as cockeyed as the rest of these loonies.
Uh, Patricia.
Just take me home, uncle.

Major, I saw that mustache too.
Oh.
Yeah.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
I've just gotten word that Major Gregorian, the Russian cosmonaut, has been invited to visit NASA.
Naturally, we're going to extend him the courtesy of the base.
It'll be interesting to exchange views with him, don't you think?
Yeah, I'd like to ask him about that, uh, female cosmonaut.
There you are.
Thank you.
Nelson's corridor.
I I Listen, I told you never to call me here.
Oh, I am sorry, master.
I thought it was important, or I would not have Well, I'm sure it's important, but couldn't it wait?
Well, I-if that is what you wish, master.
Yes, that is what I wish.
Uh, perhaps you could stop by and pick me up on your way home?
Okay, where are you?
In the Cocoa Beach jail.
Roger, give me the car to your keys.
The car to my keys?
The keys to your car.
You know what I mean.
Where are you going?
We have an important matter to discuss.
Uh, sir, there's a little emergency's come up.
Oh, did something happen to Jeannie?
Uh, no, no, she's in a In what, major?
Uh, kind of a panic.
The, uh The plumbing broke.
There's water all over the place.
You call the plumber?
Mmm, mmm.
Well, of course she should call the plumber.
Doesn't she know that wives don't bother their husbands with trivial matters, particularly when we're in the middle of an important conference?
Sir, it'll take me a minute to bail her out Bail the water out.
Oh, nonsense, major.
Now, she's got to begin to learn to cope with these things.
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Come on, will ya?
For heaven's sakes, will you kindly sit down?
You're making me nervous.
Me too.
All this over a little plumbing job?
Oh, all right.
Exactly.
Exactly.
Now, as I was saying, before you, uh, disappeared Sorry.
Major Gregorian will be given the courtesy of the base.
Oh, Major Healey, since you're a bachelor, you've been selected to show Major Gregorian around Cocoa Beach.
Well, I hope he has a strong constitution.
You will conduct him on a tour of the, uh, museum, the library, and the public school system.
I hope I have a strong constitution.
Uh, uh, sir, I really have to Uh, sit down, major.
Oh.
Since you're a married man, you've been selected to entertain Major Gregorian in your home.
Me?
We're going to give an elaborate party for Major Gregorian on Saturday night, but first I thought, well, um I'd like him to see how the, uh, typical American couple lives.
Well, you certainly picked the right couple.
Fine.
When did you say he's arriving, sir?
Tomorrow morning.
I thought perhaps that, uh, he could have dinner with you tomorrow night.
Uh, that is if, uh, Jeannie will have sufficient time.
She might be kinda tied up.
She, uh She took this, huh?
That's right, major.
She went around to every store in Cocoa Beach, saw what she wanted and walked away with it.
That is not true.
I charged it.
Hm.
Sure she charged it.
Only she doesn't have any charge accounts.
Hm.
Did I do something wrong?
Uh, yes, I'm afraid so, Jeannie.
Um, she doesn't really understand very much about charge accounts, you see.
Where is she from, the moon?
Oh, no, I'm from Babylon.
Uh, there's been a big misunderstanding here.
Well, that's what I told the store owners.
Uh, they're willing to drop charges.
Oh, well, that's great.
Wonderful.
The only thing, major, they won't take the merchandise back.
You'll have to buy it.
Well, that's perfectly all right.
How much do I owe?
Two thousand dollars.
Two thousand dollars.
Look at For all this junk.
Uh Six suits, $900.
Twenty sweaters, $400.
Ten pair of shoes, $450.
Well, I bought all these things for you.
Mrs. Bellows was going shopping for her husband, and so I wanted to get some things for you.
I I simply cannot afford all this.
Oh, but that is the lovely part about it.
You do not have to pay for it.
It is charged.
I think I better explain to you about a charge account.
You see, when you charge something, you don't have to pay for it today.
Well, that is what I said.
You have to pay for it tomorrow.
Oh.
Yeah, it's gonna take me a year to pay for all this junk.
Well, I-I just wanted you to have some nice things.
Oh, I appreciate that.
I like nice things too, darling.
I-I'd like a Rolls-Royce, but I simply cannot afford it.
We're gonna have to live on what I make.
Hey, would you mind pulling over to the side?
I'm trying to get through.
Wow.
Look at this.
A Rolls-Royce!
What a clever idea.
It clashes with the couch, but I like it.
Jeannie, would you get rid of this, please?
Don't Don't Don't.
Oh!
Oh, master!
You okay?
Are you all right?
Yeah, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
Oh, I'm so sorry, my darling.
I'm glad you're all right.

My girl and I are gonna see a horror movie.
The Monster That Stepped on Cincinnati.
Yes!
I will go get my coat We can't afford it.
Can't afford it?
You kidding?
You can't afford?
Look at this, tennis rackets.
It looks like you just bought out the stores.
What do you mean, you can't afford it?
Good night, Roge.
Good night?
Well, I don't suppose you'll let me take the Rolls-Royce?
Can I drive it into the kitchen?
The bathroom?
Just  Yeah, well, uh, nice talking to you.
See you later.
Yeah, later.
Would, uh, you like to play chess o-or w-watch television, or?
No.
We're gonna make out a budget.
A budget?
Yes, a budget.
We're gonna figure out how much clothes cost, how much, uh, food, uh, electricity, house payments, medical insurance, and you're gonna stick to that budget.
Oh, but, master, I could blink all those things No, I don't want you to blink anything ever again.
I want you to sit right down here.
You are my wife, and you're gonna have to learn to live on my salary, starting right now, you understand?
Yes, master.
Okay.
Now, ahem, I'd like a pen and some paper, please.
Oh, I did it again, didn't I?
All right.
Ahem.
Food.

It's a pleasure to meet you.
This for me is great honor.
Uh, Major Healey is gonna show you around some of the cultural exhibits in Cocoa Beach.
Uh, look, if we, uh, get through early, there's a couple of friends I'd like you to meet.
I look forward.
Uh, and you're dining with, uh, Major Nelson and his charming wife this evening.
It's a pleasure.
That is most kind.
Well, they're waiting to show us around the base.
Gentlemen.
Uh, shall we go?
I am ready.
Oh, sir, while you're here, what would you rather see, blonds or brunettes?
Uh, Major Healey.
Uh, this way, major.
How about a short, bald girl?
Roger.
Jeannie, we're home.
Go on in, major.
You?
You live here a-alone?
Well, not exactly.

They will never believe me.
Good evening, Anthony.
Hello, darling.
Uh, this is Major Gregorian.
This is my wife, Jeannie.
Oh, I am very pleased to meet you.
It is my great pleasure.
Your husband has told me everything about you.
No, not everything.
Oh!
Oh, Anthony, you're going to be so proud of me.
I'm always proud of you, darling.
Wait till you see my surprise!
Good, good.
Amazing.
I-it has springs.
Yes.
They give you all this?
Oh, no.
I buy it.
You must be millionaire.
Oh, no.
This is a, um, average American house, I guess.
Wouldn't you say?
Incredible.
Darling, I don't want to rush things, but Dr. Bellows is gonna come over and pick up Major Gregorian around 8:00.
Um, could we have dinner?
Oh, I-it is ready, Anthony.
Oh, good.
This way, please.
Uh, Jeannie's really an awfully good cook.
Please sit down and I will bring it right in.
You sit there, dear.
Thank you.
Could I tell you something in confidence, Comrade Nelson?
Oh, certainly.
In Russia, we do not live like this.
I have heard a great deal about American prosperity, but I never believed it.
You You live like czar, I-if you will excuse the expression.
Here we are.
There.
Did you make these hors d'oeuvres yourself?
Oh, those are not hors d'oeuvres, darling.
That is your dinner.
Uh, we're on a diet around here to keep the old weight down, you know.
I see.
Dig in.
Break bread.
Tsk.
You should not bolt your food like that.
It is not healthy.
Dessert.
And you shall have the largest piece, because you are the guest.
Well, certainly aren't gonna put any weight on tonight, are we?
Jeannie has this fetish about diets.
Talks about diets all the time.
Ahem.
Do you know how much this dinner cost?
Mmm?
Forty-nine cents.
That much.
And that is because the bread only cost, uh, 5 cents.
It was three days old.
It is stale.
You mean, you eat like this all the time?
Ah, we shall from now on.
No, we won't.
I can explain.
See, one of the reasons  Oh, excuse me.
I will get it.
Will you?
Yes.
Now I see how you can pay for car and house.
You go without food!
Oh, no, no.
Uh, this is just Jeannie's idea of a little joke.
We had a steak last night, uh, that you wouldn't believe.
You are right, I would not believe it.
Heh-heh-heh.
Please.
Hey, wow, man, really, that's beautiful.
Um, uh, pardon me, uh, who are you?
Didn't your wife tell you?
We're your new boarders.

Now I begin to understand.
Well, I wish you'd explain it to me because I really don't.
Well, this is the surprise I was telling you about.
Hey, man, this is a very together pad you've got here.
We're really gonna groove.
I'm afraid you're gonna have to groove someplace else, Mr Oh, Dick.
Dick Leary, and this is Joan.
Uh, Mr. and Mrs. Leary, there's been some kind of mistake.
You see, this is a private home.
Don't apologize.
That's just what we want.
A people-to-people relationship.
Dig?
Dig.
Dig.
Dig Uh, Jeannie, how did you?
How did?
Well, you see, I was out shopping and I ran into them, and they were looking for a place to live and they are going to pay us $30 a week.
Thirty dollars!
In Russia, we do not do that.
Hey, man, are you a Russian man?
Da.
Far out.
Uh, da.
Uh, Jeannie, could I speak to you for a moment please?
Oh, certainly, Anthony, uh, as soon as I show Mr. And Mrs. Leary to their rooms.
This way, please.
Show them to their room To their rooms?
Comrade, if you need any rubles No, no, I don't need any rubles.
Then, if you will excuse me, I will go out and get some dinner.
Major Gregorian thinks I'm a pauper.
Oh!
Why, that is terrible, master.
Whatever in the world gave him that idea?
You know what I will do?
I will blink this whole house into a palace of Darling, I don't want Shh!
I don't want you to do anything.
Just get rid of those people, please.
Oh, I cannot do that, master.
They have nowhere else to go.
Besides, do you know how much $30 a week will buy?
Ten steaks, eight loaves of bread and Darling, please.
Oh.
I love it when you call me "darling".
I just melt.
What was it you wanted to tell me?
Get those people out by Friday.
Yes, darling.
I will go fix your breakfast.
Uh, could I?
Do I have a clean shirt?
Oh, yes.
Yes, dear.
In the bottom drawer.
Oh, thanks.
I washed them myself.
Mm-hm.
Heh-heh.
By the end of the year, we will have saved $38.42.
Oh Including tax!
Oh, good morning.
Peace.
Did you sleep well?
Like, heavenly.
Jeannie, could you help me find another shirt, please?
Oh Oh, darling.
Excuse us.
For you.
For you.
And one for you.
And it only cost Uh, Jeannie Hey, man, I know what you're gonna say, but it's the food of the gurus and it's very cool, believe me.
Oh, master, I am so excited.
I have figured out that if we have rice for breakfast every morning, at the end of 10 years, I shall have saved $4621.39.
Including tax.
Mm-hm.
Is that not wonderful?
Oh, it's wonderful, but I don't think you understand Oh, I want to be the best wife for you, so you will be proud of me.
I am proud of you.
Mm-hm.
But I don't like rice.
Oh, well, why did you not tell me?
Tomorrow morning for breakfast we shall have spaghetti.
Oh, good.
You sold my car.
Mm-hm.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Yes?
Uh, may I speak to you for a moment?
Oh, yes, sir.
Uh, major, I just had the most incredible conversation with Major Gregorian.
Oh?
He told me that dinner at your house last night consisted of half a TV dinner and half an apple.
Now, is that any way to treat a VIP guest?
Tony, I'm surprised at you.
Cheap, cheap, cheap.
Uh, well, it was a little misunderstanding, sir.
A little misunderstanding?
Major Gregorian is under the impression that all our astronauts are on relief and the entire space program is foundering because of lack of funds.
You shouldn't have given him that impression.
Oh, major, tell me.
Uh, I know this is personal, but, uh, are you having any, uh, unusual financial problems?
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.
Uh, good, then, uh, I'm going to give you another chance to redeem yourself.
I've arranged for a For a party to be thrown tomorrow night in Major Gregorian's honor.
Oh, great.
A lovely gesture.
Listen, I'll bring the girls.
Maybe we can get a brunette.
Major Healey, I've already made out the guest list, all VIPs.
I want this to be a party that Major Gregorian will go back home and talk about.
Well, I'll certainly do everything in my power to help, sir.
I'm counting on that, Major Nelson.
It's going to be at your home.
My home.
Ahem.
Oh, uh, Jeannie?
Did you call, master?
Yes, darling, uh, we're giving a party.
Oh, a party!
That Oh, that is terrible.
Why, don't you like parties?
Certainly, master, I love them, but they are no longer on my budget.
In three days In three days I'm gonna be out of a job.
Now, we are going to give this party, Jeannie.
Do they like rice?
No, no.
Oh, by the way, NASA is paying for all this.
Oh, master, why did you not say so?
That is different.
Oh, I will prepare you a feast fit for a sultan.
That's my girl.
Certainly, master.
Oh, by the way, would you ask the Learys to stay up in their room during the party?
Oh, yes, master.
Good, good.
JEANNIE : Goodbye, master.
Uh, goodbye, Jeannie.
Uh, uh, are you sure you would not like to stop at a restaurant before dinner?
No, I I really have a surprise for you.
Gee, all the lights are out.
That's very observant of you, major.
I never would have noticed.
Jeannie!
Good evening, Anthony, darling.
Hello, darling.
Dr. Bellows.
Uh, good evening, Jeannie.
Major Gregorian.
Major Gregorian, Roger.
What happened to the lights, darling?
Oh, you will be so pleased with me.
I suddenly realized that NASA does not pay for the electricity bill Mmm.
Good evening, darling.
Fuse blew.
You didn't pay the bill, huh?
Mm!
And in one year, we will have saved $382.39.
Major Nelson, will you please get these lights on?
Our guests are gonna be arriving in a few minutes.
Uh, the The men are working on it right now.
Light some more candles.
Hm?
Light some more candles!
Oh.
Heh.
This is the most incredible thing I've ever seen.
How did you do that?
Sir?
He He He He asked how you did that.
Oh, uh, thanks, Roge.
It's an experimental simultaneous-illumination- candle-power project Roger and I are working on.
Wh-wh-what'd you say we're working on?
It's an experimental simultaneous-illumination Roger!
I'd say it's rather romantic, by candlelight.
Yes.
Very nice.
Uh, Mrs. Nelson, may I wash my hands?
No.
Why not?
Oh, because we have no water.
In one year, we will have saved $50 Mmm.
I like that.
Yeah.
Ha-ha-ha.
What kind of a neighborhood is this?
Well, it's just an average neighborhood without any water or electricity.
Major Nelson, I didn't tell you how important this evening is To you, I mean.
I know, I know, sir.
I know.
I expect this party to be memorable.
It will, sir.
I promise.
I'll get it, doctor.
Hmm.
Yes?
Like, uh, your doorbell doesn't ring.
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
I think you got the wrong house.
Hey, man, isn't this, uh, Dick and Joan's pad?
No, uh, no, this is not Dick and Joan's pad.
This is  Hey, man!
Glad you could come.
What's happening?
This is a private party.
Major Nelson, would you mind telling me what's going on here?
Who are these people?
Oh, they are friends of our boarders.
Boarders?
You take in boarders?
Hey, it's the Russian.
Hey, I thought you split.
Split?
Uh, b-but, Major Nelson, don't you understand?
There are senators, this-this-there are admirals, and all kinds of generals coming in any minute.
Darn!
Why did we leave our petition at home?
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute!
Uh, fellas, uh, there's been a mistake here.
This really is a private party.
But, miss, you don't understand!
This is all a mistake!
This is a farewell party for Major Gregorian.
He leaves tomorrow!
Oh, why didn't you say so?
Let's play him a little Russian music.
Good idea, yeah.
Whoo!
Hey, look who's here!
Hey, what a great party!
Gentlemen.
How are you?
All right.
Do svidaniya!
Goodbye!
Goodbye!
It was so much fun!
Thank you, come again.
Goodbye.
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.
That party really swung!
Major Healey, I'm afraid that's not all that's gonna swing.
Sir, I want you to know I warned you, Major Nelson!
Do you rea when you brought those hippies in here?
I can answer that!
You gave me greatest party of my whole life!
Russian music, Russian dancing, hospitality like in my country.
But they're hippies.
Is open house, everybody welcome!
I shall never forget this night.
Neither will I. Of course!
That's the way we planned it.
Russian music, Russian folk songs, dancing, candlelight!
We just wanted you to feel at home.
Yes, it was a lovely party, was it not?
Mm-hm.
You are great hostess.
Oh, and it only cost $73 Well, we have to be running along now.
I'll talk to you in the morning, major.
Oh, I'll drop you off on the way to the hotel.
Oh, Dr. Bellows, this is for you.
Why, Jeannie, it's not often that I receive a love letter from a beautiful girl.
Yes, um Wait!
Gregorian!
Gregorian!
Oh, oh, great party, great party.
Gregorian, I got I got the girl.
Was it not nice?
They all enjoyed themselves so.
What was in the letter?
Oh.
Oh, that was the bill for NASA.
I only charged them for the food.
I did not charge them for the
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
There's nothing to worry about.
Just act pleasant and talk about normal, everyday things, like the weather.
Yes, master.
Oh, and Jeannie, don't call me "master".
Oh.
Of course, husband.
Yeah, well, now "husband" is not quite right either.
That sounds so ancient.
Um Well, I am ancient.
Yeah.
Well, I know that, but I don't want Dr. Bellows to find out exactly how ancient.
Oh.
Uh Uh call me Tony, darling, dear.
Anything like that.
Oh.
Tony darling dear.
That is nice.
Just smile and nod a lot, huh?
Oh.
Here we are.
Oh, doggone it.
I forgot a gift.
A gift?
Yeah.
Is it someone's birthday?
Uh, no, no, no.
B-but when you come to someone's house for a party, it's nice to bring some flowers or some wine, or something like that.
Oh.
Well, you need not worry, master.
I can supply the gift.
Huh?
Yeah.
What's that?
A gift.
Come in.
Come in.
Hello.
Hello, please come in.
Hello.
I hope we are not too late.
Oh, not at all.
I just hate people who come right on the dot.
We brought you a bottle of wine.
Oh, well, how very sweet of you.
Oh, how adorable.
Alfred, isn't that sweet?
We can have it with our dinner.
Oh, you needn't have done that.
Isn't that an interesting- looking bottle.
But  I I can't quite read the label.
What language is that in?
Oh.
That is Persian.
It says, "Emir's Delight".
You can read Persian?
Oh, yes.
Uh, the liquor store owner told us what it said.
A-and that is the vintage.
Fifteen ninety one?
An excellent year.
Major Nelson this wine is nearly Yeah.
I believe it, from the looks of the bottle.
Uh, no, I think it's a typographical error, sir.
I think that reads, uh, 1951.
Oh.
Of course.
How silly of me.
Well, I I wonder whose picture that is.
Oh, that is Abbas I. Shah of Persia from 1586 to 1621.
He was particularly fond of this wine.
Was he?
Hm.
Did the liquor store owner tell you all that?
Oh, no.
I knew him.
Heh.
You knew?
Intimately.
Yes.
Oh, she reads a lot of history, uh, on the Middle East.
She's a great history buff.
Yeah, a great buff.
Oh.
Well, for heaven For a minute Well, listen, I don't know how this wine is going to taste, but believe me, it certainly is an interesting conversation piece, isn't it?
Ha-ha-ha.
Thank you.
Shall we go in?
Yes.
Where'd you get the wine?
From the cellar of the Great Djinn.
You mean the date on that thing is correct?
Yes, master.
Oh, do not worry, master.
The Great Djinn only drinks the best.
Oh.
May I help you, Mrs. Bellows?
Oh.
No, thank you, dear.
Everything's all ready.
I thought we'd eat right away.
Alfred gets very testy when he's hungry.
Oh, Amanda, I do not.
See what I mean?
He's very testy.
Won't you sit down, dear, right there?
Is this ours?
Oh, thank you very much, major.
Of course.
And if you'd sit right over there, opposite me.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Doctor.
I'm so anxious to taste that wine.
It looks absolutely heavenly.
Alfred, would you mind opening the wine for us, please?
Oh, of course.
I'll get it.
It's perfectly all right, major.
I'm perfectly capable of popping a cork.
Oh, uh, by the way, we're having a rather important guest stop by after dinner.
Oh, here you are, dear.
Oh.
Ooh.
I really don't understand why you invited him.
Why did you, dear?
Oh, because he happens to be a member of the House Appropriations Committee, and General Schaeffer suggested it.
Uh, uh, uh Congressman Farragut?
Uh, that's right.
He's coming here?
Yes.
Uh He's conducting a full-dress study of the space program.
That's why I must impress you that it's very important to see that everything goes all right.
Let me help you with that, sir.
Why don't I take this back to the liquor store?
I'm sure I can get a refund.
It's perfectly all right.
It's your wine.
I must say that if this cork Oh!
That was beautiful, Alfred.
You should have been a maitre d'.
Oh, the strangest thing that ever happened to me.
It just came out all of a sudden.
Just serve the wine, dear.
Now, here we are.
Let's see.
Mmm.
Delicious bouquet.
Marvelous.
Simply marvelous.
Well, I'm glad you like it, sir.
Darling, do you plan on drinking it all yourself?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Here we are.
Alfred, our guests.
Darling, first, please.
Oh.
Of course.
Whoever picked this wine out made a wonderful choice.
Oh, why, thank you.
Oh, um, try it, Amanda.
Try it.
You're going to absolutely love it.
Not too sweet, not too dry.
Oh.
All right.
It is delicious.
Well, I have a very good idea.
I think I'm going to serve everything at one time.
May I have your plates, please?
Jeannie, your plate?
Huh?
Oh.
Thank you.
Now, let me see, what kind of meat do you prefer, Jeannie?
Do you like light or dark?
Thank you.
Rare, please.
Rare chicken?
Funny, Jeannie.
Rare chicken indeed.
Well, anything.
Anything at all.
Alfred, where are you?
Dropped my napkin.
Here you are, dear.
I've given you a little bit of both.
Pass the rolls, please.
Alfred, you didn't have to go in the kitchen.
They're right here on the table.
What kitchen?
I'm right here.
Right where?
I can't see you.
Oh, there you are.
Anthony, what is the matter?
What is it, Major Nelson?
Something caught in my throat.
But I haven't served you yet.
Oh.
I gotta talk to you.
Excuse us, please.
Oh, I hope he's all right.
May I have your plate, dear?
Well, certainly.
What's going on?
I do not know, master.
Can you see 'em?
No.
Can you?
Not even an outline.
But they can see us, and each other.
Oh, that's great wine.
Great wine.
Well, I am sorry, master.
I did not know.
The Great Djinn must have put something in it.
Yeah Well, do you think you can fix it?
Well, I will try.
Try?
Yes.
It did not work.
Major Nelson!
Coming, ma'am Sir.
Ha-ha-ha.
How long do you think it's gonna take for that stuff to wear off?
Only the Great Djinn would know that.
Well, maybe it's like regular alcohol.
When the wine wears off, they'll reappear, huh?
Mmm.
Perhaps.
Yeah.
All right.
Well, in the meantime, we'll have to act natural and pretend that they're there.
Yes, master.
Don't let 'em drink any more wine.
No, master.
Fine.
That ought to do it.
Farragut.
Oh, I beg your pardon.
Congre Congressman Farragut.
What's he gonna do when he sees them?
Or doesn't see them?
Oh, master, master.
Perhaps we could get him to drink some of the wine.
That's a grand idea.
So, what are you going to do?
I don't know.
I'll think of something.
Act natural.
Coming.
I'll get it, dear.
Here we are.
Oh.
It looks wonderful.
Yes, it certainly does.
I I certainly admire your wife's cooking, Dr. Bellows.
Major, is something wrong with your eyes this evening?
Alfred is answering the telephone.
I've always enjoyed Mrs. Bellows' cooking, doctor!
Hello?
Oh, hello, congressman.
No.
No, no, no, no.
It's No, no, no, it's not too early at all.
Come ahead.
You can have some dessert with us.
Fine.
We'll see you in a few minutes.
Dr. Bellows, wait.
Sir.
Wait.
Wait, Dr. Bellows.
Wait.
Wait, sir!
Oh!
Major Nelson, can't you watch where you're going?
Oh.
You ran right into me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Huh.
Sorry, sir.
Here.
Uh, let me help you up here.
And how do you propose to do that when you're holding on to my ankle?
Here.
Oh.
Sir, about Congressman Farragut You can let go now, major.
I'm perfectly able to stand on my own.
Well, after a fall like that, sir, you better let me help you to your chair here.
Major, he didn't fall.
You know, you're acting very peculiar tonight.
About par for the course, I'd say.
Well.
I-i-it is the wine.
But, Jeannie, he didn't have any wine.
And neither have you.
But, you know, I think I'll have a little more.
I'm feeling deliciously tipsy.
Well Uh, Mrs. Bellows Yes, Jeannie?
Nothing, nothing.
Uh, we were talking about Congressman Farragut, sir?
Yes, we were.
And I hope you get over whatever it is you've got before he gets here.
I'd hate to have him see you like this.
Uh, when will he be here, sir?
About ten minutes, I imagine.
Oh, uh, let me have some more wine, will you, please?
Here you are, dear.
Ten minutes?
No more wine!
My dinner.
Good heavens.
Look what you've done!
For heaven sakes.
The whole dinner.
Well, at least I saved the wine.
Yes.
Oh, my beautiful new outfit is just totally ruined.
Jeannie, would you please help me get some of this stuff into the kitchen?
Oh, uh Uh Y Y-yes, Mrs. Bellows.
Of course.
Ouch!
Oh, uh, I am sorry.
Let's get the table fully up, major.
Oh, of course.
Not from the same side, major.
There you are, sir.
Dr. Bellows.
I, uh  I'd like to see you, uh, major.
Oh.
In here.
I wanna talk to you.
Oh.
Yes?
Major Nelson I want you to know that I'm not angry with you.
After all, accidents do happen.
But as long as you seem to be having a rather run of them tonight, perhaps it Well, it would be better if you left before the congressman arrives.
Oh, uh, no, sir.
I've been dying to meet Congressman Farragut.
Uh, I'll I'll be careful.
I promise you.
I do have one suggestion, however.
So do I. Get off my lap.
Hm?
Oh, sorry, sir.
Um, I don't think the congressman ought to come here alone, sir.
Well, why not?
He's taking a taxi from NASA.
It's only 10 minutes away.
Well, it's really a point of etiquette, I suppose.
I I don't I think somebody ought to Ought to pick him up.
Uh, I mean, after all, he is a member of the Appropriations Committee.
Perhaps you're right.
Let's go get him.
Huh.
No.
There's no sense in ruining your evening No sense in ruining your evening, sir.
Or mine.
I'll have Roger pick him up.
Major Healy?
Why should we bother him?
Oh, he'd do anything for the space program, sir.
You just relax, take it easy, and, uh, smoke your pipe, and I'll call Roger.
Hm?
Nice, uh, tobacco you have there, sir.
Very aromatic.
Roger, honey.
The phone.
Mmm.
Oh.
I don't hear a thing.
Well, you must be deaf, because it's ringing.
Oh, yeah.
Oh.
Hello.
Hello.
Oh, it's for you.
It's for me.
Hmm.
Sorry, wrong number.
Roge, this is Tony.
I'm sorry, I don't know any Tonys.
Goodbye, Tony.
Roger, will you listen?
This is important.
For heaven sakes, Major Nelson.
If he Well, if he's busy, leave him alone.
Uh Uh, yes, sir.
Don't hang up.
Don't hang up.
Uh, sir, he wants to talk to me in private.
Excuse me.
Now, Roger, I don't have a lot of time.
I want you to go pick up Congressman Farragut, and don't bring him to Dr. Bellows' house.
Congressman Farragut?
Yeah, that's right.
He'll be catching a cab in five minutes.
I want you to pick him up before he leaves.
Well, look, why don't we split it up?
You go to NASA, pick up Congressman Farragut, and I won't go to Dr. Bellows' house.
Oh.
Roger, l-look, I'm desperate.
Uh, Dr. and Mrs. Bellows drank some wine that Jeannie blinked, and they disappeared.
There shouldn't be any trouble.
He won't be able to see her anyway.
Roger, I'll never ask you to do anything like this again in my whole life, but you've got to delay Farragut.
And don't let him get here before you call me and make sure it's all right.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You don't know what you're asking.
Roger, please.
I'll I'll make it up to you.
Believe me.
Yeah.
You can't.
You're the wrong sex.
What's the matter, honey?
Well, we've gotta go someplace and not take someone somewhere.
Let's go, huh?
Oh.
Good, good.
Keep that.
Don't lose it.
It's all set.
Roger's gonna take care Anthony, watch out!
Whee!
Oh, that was close.
Major, you've been bumping into things all night.
Let him alone, Alfred.
He's clumsy, but he's cute.
Coffee time.
Amanda, you're drunk.
I know.
And it's marvelous.
I'm sorry, master.
She drank more of the wine.
Why didn't you stop her?
I could not see her.
Shh.
Look at me.
I'm a circus act.
Oh, Amanda, stop that.
Congressman Farragut is coming.
Oh, I wouldn't worry about that, sir.
Maybe he'll be late.
AMANDA : Listen, gang, why don't we all just ditch that old congressman, huh?
And why don't we all go dancing?
Amanda, please, for heaven sakes, have some coffee.
Oh.
Hey, this That's a good idea.
Why don't we all have some coffee?
You too, Dr. Bellows.
Okay, party poopers.
So we don't go dancing.
I know.
Let's play charades.
Huh?
Charades?
Oh, uh, Congressman Farragut?
Yes, that's right.
Oh, I'm Major Healy.
Oh, yes, the astronaut.
Yeah, I came to take you to Dr. Bellows' house.
That's very nice of you, major, but I've already called a cab.
We couldn't let you do that.
You're NASA's guest.
Don't wanna take any chances on losing a congressman, huh?
Well, can I show you around the airport?
I've seen the airport.
I landed here.
You've seen the airport.
Oh, well, let me introduce you to someone.
Uh, this is Linda Watkins.
This is the congressman.
Oh, how do you do?
Hi.
I've never picked up a congressman before.
How about the other way around?
Huh?
Nothing.
Well here we are.
I, uh, guess the car won't start, huh?
Uh, you might try putting the key in the ignition.
Oh.
Hey, that's right.
That's right.
I'm not very mechanical.
And you're an astronaut?
Well, those spaceships run automatically.
D-did you ever go to Cocoa Beach?
No.
This is my first time here.
Good.
Good, good.
Where did you say you put the key again?
Uh, the ignition.
Oh, the ignition.
Yeah.
It's on the right side.
It's a new car.
On the right.
Well Oh, the old one was on the left side of the old car.
Uh Uh, p-please drink it, Mrs. Bellows.
Don't want coffee.
Wanna go dancing.
Well, you'll feel much better if you drink it.
Believe me.
I feel fine now.
Um Uh, master, may I speak to you for a moment?
Please excuse us.
Amanda, please drink the coffee.
If Congressman Farragut shows up with you like this, it'll make a terrible impression.
He doesn't know the half of it.
Oh, master, this is impossible.
We keep running into them.
Keep your eye on Dr. Bellows' pipe.
Oh, I do, I do.
But he keeps setting it down.
Yeah.
And there is no way to keep track of Mrs. Bellows.
Hey.
Hold this.
Hm?
Maybe there is.
If I can get these on her.
Oh, wait.
Um, you know, Mrs. Bellows, you're looking particularly lovely tonight.
There's only one thing missing with your outfit: Uh.
Some jewelry around your neck.
Major Nelson, what do you think you're doing?
Would you kindly get these bells off me?
Oh.
Sorry.
I'm sorry.
Oh, Alfred, I thought they looked very cute on you.
You know, I've never smoked a pipe before.
It's good.
Ah.
Now, here we are.
Now this is, uh This is where our newest supermarket's going to be Uh, major.
Major, Dr. Bellows is waiting for me.
Now, we've been driving around for 20 minutes.
Has it been 20 minutes?
It's amazing how time flies when you're having a good time.
Would you like to see more of Cocoa Beach?
Oh, some other time, major.
Right now, would you please take me to 310 Orange Drive.
Uh, yes, sir.
It's to the left here.
Oh, no, Roge, honey, it's to the right.
To the left.
No sense of direction.
Roger, I live on Orange Drive.
And you keep losing your way home every night.
Major.
To the right.
Yeah.
To the right.
That's right.
You're right, it was right.
Mm-hm.
There, there, Mrs. Bellows.
Just Just relax.
Bells, bells Beautiful bells Ding-a-ling-a-ling, bells   Major Nelson, this evening has turned into a first-class disaster.
And I think we'd better end it now before catastrophe strikes.
I'll make your apologies to the congressman.
If he ever gets here.
Uh, sir, I think you're gonna need a little help.
I mean, with Mrs. Bellows, in the condition she's in.
The Nelsons are going home, dear.
No.
Don't want them to go home.
Want to have a party.
Oh.
Whoo!
Oh.
Amanda, stop it.
If they're going, then I'm going too.
Amanda, come back.
Oh, no.
This is all I need.
Amanda?
Dr. Bellows?
Oh!
Oh, Anthony.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
Here.
Oh, Major Nelson, I've never known anyone like you in my life.
Oh.
Dr. Bellows, you're here.
Well, of course I'm here.
And I was over there too, until you ran over me.
Huh?
Oh.
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you, sir.
Major Nelson, have you gone completely over the edge?
Yoo-hoo.
You can't find me.
Give me that thing, will you?
Amanda?
Amanda?
Come out from wherever you are.
Instantly.
He's back.
Dr. Bellows is back.
I know, master.
But, unfortunately, Mrs. Bellows is still missing.
Yeah.
Major Healy, as a matter of public interest, I would like to know how you managed to get to the moon when you can't get someplace four blocks away.
Well, I'm very bad with short distances.
Heh-heh.
I'll get you to Dr. Bellows' as soon as I make this phone call.
Frankly, I doubt it.
Come on, Tony, will you answer?
Tony?
Oh, come on, Ton.
Roger, when do we get to stop playing crazy taxi?
I I'll make this call and then we'll drop him off, okay?
No, you won't.
Because your fare just got another cab.
Hello?
Look, uh, Roger, don't come yet.
Dr. Bellows is back, but Mrs. Bellows is outside playing hide-and-seek.
Yeah, well, if she's invisible, she must be winning.
Now.
Well, just keep stalling Farragut.
Yeah, I can't.
He just took a taxi.
Oh, you better find Mrs. Bellows within 10 minutes, or else you're it.
Now where were we?
Roger, we're in public.
Is that where we were?
Oh.
Oh.
I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
Oh, Dr. Bellows.
I'm sure I saw Mrs. Bellows off in that direction.
Oh, thank you.
Amanda, come out!
It's my turn to hide now!
Oh, this is terrible.
Simply terrible.
Master?
Master?
Shh.
Dr. Bellows went that way.
Oh, great.
Just be quiet, would you?
You got her?
Yes, I've got her.
She's asleep.
Oh!
Sorry, Mrs. B  Keep looking, Dr. Bellows.
I-I'm sure she's in that direction.
Well  Excuse me.
Is this the Bellows' house?
Oh, w Well, uh Yes.
Yes, it It is the Bellows' house.
Oh.
Congressman Farragut.
Doctor, you'll never believe the problem I had getting here.
You look as though you had a problem yourself.
Oh, yes.
I'm sorry.
Congressman, I have to be frank with you.
We were having a little something with dinner, and it seemed to get my wife Everything's all right, sir.
Mrs. Bellows' headache was so bad, she decided to lie down.
She asked to be forgiven.
Major, is she, uh?
Asleep in her bed, sir.
Thanks heavens.
Oh, congressman.
I just wanted to say Master.
Is she?
Visible.
As soon as she hit the mattress.
Oh.
Shall we get out of here?
Uh, yes.
Doctor, if this is inconvenient Not at all, not at all.
Doctor.
We're gonna have to leave now.
Jeannie's not feeling well.
I look forward to meeting you on the base tomorrow.
I'm sorry you have to leave so soon.
Good night, Jeannie.
Good night, major.
Oh, why don't you come in and sit down, and have a nice glass of wine?
Wait!
Dr. Bellows!
Dr. Bellows!
Dr. Bellows, please!
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Oh, Mrs. Bellows, I am so excited.
Just imagine, a whole week in Los Angeles.
Oh, yes.
Jeannie, well, now don't you worry.
Alfred and I understand that this trip is taking the place of your honeymoon.
So as soon as we're unpacked and settled in that room, we are gonna leave you completely alone.
Now, now.
Just be careful.
Be careful Oh, girls.
If we're gonna get that swim in Good afternoon, sir.
Oh, good afternoon.
No, no, no.
Never mind.
I'll manage.
Thank you.
You tip them to bring the bags to the desk, and then again to bring 'em to the rooms.
It's absolutely ridiculous.
You're right.
Oh, uh, gentlemen, you watch the luggage, I'll check the reservations.
This way, ladies.
Well Right this way.
How do you do, sir?
Good afternoon.
Um, I believe that you have, uh, reservations for three rooms.
Uh, they're in the name of Major Roger Healey.
Just one moment, please.
This is a nice hotel.
Very nice.
Good.
I'm sorry, but, uh, we don't have any reservations under the name of Healey.
And there isn't a vacant room in the house.
That's impossible.
Well, of course, it's impossible.
They were made over two weeks ago.
Uh, excuse us a moment.
Uh, Amanda.
Alfred, how could this possibly?
I'm awfully sorry, ma'am.
But I could call around, and try and find you accommodations, but it's not going to be easy.
You see, there are three conventions in town.
Unfortunately, this hotel has only 12 floors.
Heh.
And at times like this, I wish we could just, uh grow another one.
Heh.
Yes.
Yes, that would be very convenient.
What's the matter, Amanda?
Alfred.
It is all right, everyone.
They have rooms for all of us.
Uh, what did you do to them?
She didn't do anything.
A pretty girl can do things that we ordinary mortals can't, that's all.
Well done, Jeannie.
I should say so, Jeannie.
Let's go see the room.
I hope Uh, sir, couldn't we wait for the bellhop?
Oh, don't be silly, major.
We can save another tip.
Here.
Take this.
Okay.
Yeah, here we go.
There we are.
Okay.
Wow!
Here.
This one in here.
Oh, there it is.
Now, wait a minute.
You got it?
All right.
Pull it up.
Uh Oh, okay.
There.
There you are.
Okay.
You can come back for the others later.
Huh?
I'll do it this time, Agnes.
You watch.
Oh, no.
Not again.
It's Fotheringay again.
He went into the elevator.
If you don't stop him he's gonna jump.
Get.
Get!
Don't jump, Mr. Fotheringay.
Don't jump.
No.
Thirteen-oh-two?
Thirteen-oh-nine.
There are only 12 floors.
There are only 12 floors.
By now I'm off the roof.
I beg your pardon.
I told you, we can manage.
Oh, this way, everyone.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Apparently, everything's just a handout.
Hm?
W-w-would someone please tell me what's going on here?
I better tell someone.
No.
Someone better tell me.
Ah!
Oh, sorry.
Mm.
Mm.
You blinked a whole floor?
Well, certainly.
Well, it would have looked silly to have just three rooms sitting up here all alone.
Yeah, that's right.
How did you know?
Because no hotel in the world has 13 floors.
It's bad luck.
Well, it is good luck for us.
Otherwise, we would have no place to stay.
Yeah, but, darling, hotels don't grow.
Children grow, trees grow, but I mean, hotels just can't  Shh.
Hello, there.
I'm sorry if I'm in your room, but you see, I'm having a hallucination due to excessive alcohol, and you're part of it.
Uh, pardon me, sir, do you have any idea where you are?
Certainly.
I'm on the 13th floor.
That's how I know I'm hallucinating.
No hotel has a 13th floor.
Well, h-how did you get here?
Oh, I come over here every few weeks to jump off the roof.
Of course, I never make it.
But And I didn't make it this time either, obviously.
Well, sorry to bother you.
Uh, p Pardon me, sir.
D Where are you going?
I am going down to the desk clerk.
I'm gonna complain.
They can't expect anybody to jump off the 13th floor.
Yeah.
That's bad luck.
Wait.
Would you stop him, please?
Oh, certainly, master.
Uh, what shall I do with him?
I don't know.
Put him someplace Anywhere.
I gotta think.
Very well.
Hm.
Where'd you put him?
Oh.
In Room 1302.
He will like it.
It has a very nice view of the bar.
Uh, sure beats green snakes.
Give me room service.
Please, Perkins, I'm very busy.
We have a full house.
You got more than a full house.
I tell ya, this hotel has a 13th floor, and there are people living there.
Twelve, Perkins.
Twelve.
But I went outside and counted them.
Thirteen.
Perkins go lie down for a while.
Mr. Montjoy.
The most peculiar thing.
I just got a call to send an order of Scotch to Room 1302.
Come on.
Do I have to?
Sh.
Oh, hi, gang.
Shh.
What's the matter?
You Oh, you guys going out too?
No, no.
We're gonna change hotels, Roger.
Why are we gonna change hotels?
I got a beautiful room.
I know.
I know.
But Jeannie blinked it.
She blinked the whole floor.
We gotta get the Bellows out before they figure it out.
Why would they figure it out?
I haven't figured it out.
There's such room as There's no such thing as a 13th floor.
Why would there be a 13th floor in a hotel?
There's no reason to unpack, sir.
These rooms won't be suitable Don't be ridiculous, major.
These are perfectly good rooms.
I see no reason to leave them.
Well, we do have that meeting at March Air Force Base in about three days, sir.
If If we should catch cold because of the drafty rooms Drafty rooms?
What are you talking about, major?
We haven't felt a draft here.
Major Healey, is your room drafty?
Oh yes, it's, uh The gale in a stor Gale storms.
That's funny.
There's no draft in this room.
Wind.
Why, it's impossible!
How How did it get so cold in here?
It's 85 degrees outside.
Uh, it's the Santa Ana, sir.
It comes in off the desert very suddenly sometimes.
Darling, all you have to do is simply shut the window.
No, major, you see, I'm all unpacked.
And we're very happy that you're concerned.
But I have no intention of moving.
Uh, well, it's not only the wind and the cold.
Do you happen to know that this hotel is located directly under the glide path for the L.A. International Airport?
Nonsense.
We haven't heard any planes.
I haven't heard any planes.
What's that?
You see, sir.
You'll never get any sleep.
Major Nelson, in case you've forgotten, we live in Cocoa Beach, right next to the air base.
And we don't intend to let a little airplane noise bother us.
Excuse me.
Yeah, yeah, major.
Excuse me.
Do you mind?
You see, we wanna change, because Alfred is taking me out to dinner, and I'd like to get dressed, if you don't mind.
I'd like to change.
Uh Oh, yeah, but you won't like  Major Nelson, if you want to move, you're perfectly welcome.
But we're staying put.
Hi there, you figment of my alcohol diseased imagination.
Hey, are you having any trouble with the room service?
They act like this floor doesn't even exi Afraid you have the wrong room.
Jeannie, Roger.
Come on.
Have a nice dinner.
Yeah, nice talkin' to ya.
Excuse me, sir.
Whoops.
Hey, will ya?
Wait a minute, now.
This started out like a pretty good hallucination.
Let's keep it that way, huh?
Right through this door, Mr. Montjoy.
Hold him.
Hold him together.
Uh-oh.
You're not gonna believe this.
It's locked.
It wasn't before.
Let's push.
It feels like someone's holding it.
Just push.
Come here, come here.
Hey, you look more scared than me, and I'm the one that's having the hallucination.
Would you put him I told you to hold him.
Blink this place out of here.
Oh.
But master, the Bellows are in I don't care.
One disaster at a time.
Blink the whole floor out.
Wait, I left the shower curtain out.
Oh, he left the shower Jeannie.
Ah!
There it is, Mr. Montjoy.
The Roof, Perkins.
R-O-O-F.
Roof.
Alfred.
Alfred.
Can you help me?
My zipper's caught in my hair.
Just a second, honey.
Shh.
Shh.
Hm.
Did it suddenly get cold in here?
Maybe it's one of those drafts Major Nelson was talking about earlier.
I Someone opened another window, I suppose.
Yeah.
Perkins come along.
You and I must have a long talk.
Don't you want to have a look around?
What for?
I've seen the roof.
I know what it looks like.
Oh, never mind, Alfred.
I got it.
Pop the corridor back in.
Pop the corridor back in.
Mm-hm.
You know, up until today, I figured I'd stop drinking.
But not now.
This is too much fun.
Where are you going?
I'm going to the bar.
For the last few minutes, this hallucination's been going downhill.
You're wouldn't tell anybody about this, would you?
Oh.
Are you kidding?
I may be a drunk, but I'm not crazy.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, that's one problem gone.
And the Bellows are going out to dinner for the evening.
And that means we shall have the evening all to ourselves.
No, no, we're not.
We can't let the Bellows get out of this hotel.
Oh, but, master, if they leave, that means we can be alone.
Darling, they can't leave because there's no elevator.
Easy.
I will simply blink an elevator.
I don't want you to blink any elevator.
If they go downstairs and tell anybody they've been living on the 13th floor, I'm in real trouble.
Yeah, well, what do we do now?
Well, until this, uh, floor is blinked out once and for all, we're gonna make the Bellows very happy right here.
Right here on this floor.
Great way to spend a vacation.
Or a honeymoon.
Yeah.
Or a honeymoon.
Oh, boy.
You get your own honeymoon.
Amanda, you got the key, dear?
Yes, darling, it's right here in my purse.
Ready?
Uh-huh.
Surprise.
Surprise.
Here are some flowers for you, Mrs. Bellows.
We found a wonderful restaurant right here in the hotel, sir, and I took the liberty of ordering a gourmet dinner right up here.
Well, now, I Isn't that nice?
Well, yes, indeed, it is nice.
But, good heavens, I thought you two wanted to spend this evening alone.
We do.
Uh, but But we thought it would be nice if we all spent our first night in Los Angeles together.
Alfred, isn't that the sweetest thing you've ever heard?
Yes.
Um is, uh, Major Healey coming?
Oh, I hope so.
Oh, I'm I'm sure he'll be here any Wow.

Oh, isn't it exciting, darling?
Oh, do you think we should invite the Nelsons to join us?
Oh, Amanda.
Honeymoon couples like to sleep late.
Oh, yes.
Of course they do.
Good morning, everybody.
Hi.
Would you like to wile away a few hours with the cards?
Huh?
Oh, don't be silly, major.
We're going to Disneyland.
Uh.
Major, it's a beautiful day.
Well, no, the forecast calls for, uh, rain.
Rain?
Yes, rain.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why, there's not a cloud in the sky.
Amanda.
Oh, how terrible.
Oh.
Would you like to play a little, uh, whist or pinochle?
Hey.
What a beautiful day out, isn't it?
Ha-ha.
Ah.
For a rainstorm.

Thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Oh.
Hello, Major Healey.
What am I gonna do with this?
Can you help?
Oh, certainly, Major Healey.
Just go right into our room.
In your room.
What's in there?
Ah.
Oh.
Well, this is all very nice, major, but really, we don't mind shopping in the rain.
There's no sense shopping in the rain when the hotel has everything you need.
Where's Jeannie?
I should think she'd want to see this.
Uh Uh, little tired, sir.
She decided to take a nap.
Nice, huh?
One-hundred-fourteen, fifty at the boutique downstairs.
Nice, huh?
Ah.
Oh!
Oh!
Well Amanda, come on.
Shh.
Let's go.
Come on.
Shh.
Shh.
All right.
Shh.
Watch it, watch it.
Shh, shh.
Now, when I got downstairs Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
Ooh.
Thank you.
Shh.
Tiptoe out.
Watch it.
Ah!
Dinner is served.
Oh.
We didn't order any Here you are.
A-Alfred This must be some mistake.
Major Nelson asked me to send this up here exactly for you.
No, no, no, no, no.
No.
Sit down, madame.
And you, sir.
Sit right down there.
Oh, now Thank you.
There you are, madame.
And for you, sir.
And dinner is served.
Hava Nagila Hava I'm suffocating, Alfred.
I If at first you don't succeed and, uh Oh, all that.
There he goes again.
After him.
Oh no, sir.
Not me.
Perkins, he's liable to jump.
If I go up there and find a 13th floor again, so am I. Heaven's sakes, I'll go with you.
Take over for a few minutes.
Come on.
Do I have to?
Shh-shh-shh-shh.
Shh-shh-shh.
Shh-shh.
Amanda.
What?
Do you think leaving a note is enough?
Maybe we should tell them.
Oh, no, Alfred.
No.
If we tell them, they'll just think of some other way of keeping us here.
And, Alfred, I can't stand it anymore.
Now, Amanda Oh.
This is ridiculous.
You've been the 13th floor long enough.
You're a roof.
You understand?
You're a roof.
That's funny.
It must be the other way.
Oh, Alfred.
It's not the other way.
I know where we got off the elevator, and it was right here.
Then where is it?
I don't know.
Alfred, we're trapped!
Oh, that Oh, e-excuse me.
Could you kindly tell me where the elevator is?
What's the matter, buddy?
You crazy?
There ain't no elevator on the roof.
Perkins, what do you see?
Just the roof, sir.
With wall-to-wall carpeting?
It's a real class hotel.
Come along, Perkins.
We're going to get to the bottom of this.
Must we?
Alfred, did you hear what he just said?
Pay no attention, dear.
He's drunk.
I know he's drunk.
I know.
But the point is But he said Oh, uh, here's the desk clerk.
Oh, uh, excuse us.
But we're looking for the elevator.
What are you people doing on the roof?
Now, see here.
Enough is enough.
We've been staying in this hotel for the past three days.
We have a room on the 13th floor.
So would you kindly tell us where the elevator is?
First, you have not been staying here because I told you there were no rooms.
Second, there is no 13th floor.
Therefore, thirdly, there can't be any elevator.
Going down?
Who are you?
Sir, I have no time for conversation.
If you would all step into the rear of the lift, please.
Oh, Alfred, I I have calls on nine, seven, three and five.
Floors?
Up, please.
You won't say anything, will you?
Say anything about what?
About what.
Yes, that's right.
There's nothing to say.
Oh, uh I-I'll check out, Amanda.
Uh, that has all been taken care of, sir.
What?
Yes.
Say, uh, you're the only one around here who seems to know what's going on.
Thanks you, sir.
Would you kindly explain?
You mean you don't know?
Oh, no wonder you're confused.
Well, you see, this hotel has no 13th floor.
Or rather, it does, but no one is supposed to know about it, you see.
It's owned entirely by, um, an eccentric millionaire industrialist, whose initials are H.H.  H.H. Shh.
Please, madam.
Shh, shh.
Well I I'll get it.
Yes.
When H.H. heard that That, uh, persons from NASA were here, including the two astronauts, and there were no rooms available, of course he made his suite available for you.
Oh.
How incredibly generous.
Well, I thought so.
Uh, uh, tell me, is, um, H.H. staying in this hotel?
We'd like to thank him.
That's impossible.
I'm afraid H.H. is asleep.
Thank you very much.
Did you blink it out?
Oh, yes, master.
No more 13th floor.
Uh, hello.
And, uh, tell me what made you all decide to check out too?
We got in trouble with the shop steward.
He wanted us to join the waiters' union.
Your cab's on its way.
Uh, thank you very much.
Uh Alfred.
Give him something.
Oh, yes.
There we are.
Alfred, for heaven's sake.
This hotel has bent over backwards to give us good service.
Give him enough for everyone.
Well, of course.
That's for the waiter.
And that's for the wine steward.
And that's for the valet.
And Don't forget the elevator boy.
Oh, yes.
The, um The elevator boy.
You know, the very bright one.
The one with the, uh The small mustache.
And, uh this is for you.
The entire staff thanks you.
You're very welcome.
Bye.
Bye.
Nice working with you.
I need a vacation.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
I hope they had time to get some sleep.
Leslie looked so tired aboard the carrier.
Didn't you think he looked tired?
Oh, do not worry, Mrs. Wingate.
Just think.
They will have three weeks to do nothing but eat and sleep.
Oh, I'm so excited I can hardly contain myself.
Well, try, Mrs. Wingate.
Do try.
Oh, I wish we could allow you to give them a more personal greeting but, uh Well, you do understand the need for the 21-day isolation period.
And after all, in your condition, Sally, we're having enough trouble with Earth germs.
Well, they're waiting to see you, ladies.
Alfred, darling.
Listen, I I think we should let them go in by themselves.
I mean, they can't touch, but, well, at least we could give them some privacy.
That's a good idea, Amanda.
Uh, ladies.
Uh, we're gonna wait for you outside.
Good luck.
Good luck.
Jeannie.
Sally.
Dr. Bellows.
Oh.

Listen, I know you two miss each other, but this doesn't look too good.
Jeannie, get out of here.
I am sorry, master, but when I saw you, I forgot myself.
Ah, no.
You can't go.
But But But master Once you're in here, you're contaminated.
Oh.

My wife My wife's having the baby.

I couldn't go to sleep.
I'm much too nervous.
See, this is our first.
Uh.
Tony.
Uh, would you pass me that, uh, cushion, huh?
Why don't you go in the bedroom and lie down?
It's much more comfortable.
Yeah.
You really ought to relax.
Pass me a cushion, huh?
Give him a cushion.
Here you are.
My My cushion.
What's the matter?
You won't believe this, gentlemen but it's finally happened.
Heh.
But what?
We brought something back with us from the moon.
Space garbage.
And it's in this wastebasket.
Well, uh, let me see.
No, no, no.
You'll let it out.
Now, we have to, uh We have to alert the base.
Right.
Right.
Major Healey.
Press the alarm button.
Alarm button.
Roger.
Are you sure, man?
Would I stand here with a wastebasket and a cushion if I wasn't?
What did it look like?
It's a tiny creature about 6 inches long, blond hair, female.
Wait a minute.
Did she have a black dress on?
That's impossible.
There's no life on the moon.
Armstrong and Aldrin have proved that.
Well, they're wrong.
Now, listen, if you're not gonna press that alarm button, I will.
Hold that.
Huh?
Stop him.
Stop him.
Get out of here.
Yes, master.
Wait a minute, commander.
Let's talk this over.
Healey, get out of my way.
Come on.
I saw it.
Nelson, the wastebasket.
I'm sorry, sir.
Look.
You let it out.
Huh?
Yeah.
Get out.
Huh?
I said w It's out.
Whatever was in there is certainly out now.
You let it out?
Mm-hm.
Well, gentlemen, what seems to be the problem?
Please, please.
One at a time.
Oh, uh, this is Mr. Heatherington of the wire services.
Now, uh, what fantastic thing happened, commander?
Well, sir.
I was sitting on the arm of that chair Hey, you're from the wire services, huh?
He will be covering the Isolation Lab for the entire 21 days.
Sir.
I was sitting Hey, that's marvelous.
Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
You're interrupting the commander.
Um.
Thank you, Roge For pointing that out, Roger.
Sir, I was I was saying that it's great to To have someone like him here so that the whole world could know if anything interesting happens here.
We're very glad you're pleased.
Now will you let Commander Wingate continue?
Yeah, well, what I meant was that, uh You know, in case somebody, uh, loses his grip because of the strain and starts seeing things, you know?
Go ahead, Leslie.
Sorry.
Well, commander.
We're waiting.
My wife's having a baby.
Right.
Yeah, we're waiting.
Any moment it's gonna be here.
The The baby, right?
Roger!
The baby.
Thanks for stopping me, Tony.
I I really could have put my foot in it back there.
Oh.
Well, you can't expect a man who's about to become a new father to think straight.
Yeah.
Well, I'm okay now.
All right.
Good, good.
You know, I really thought I saw something in that wastebasket.
Yeah.
That's my room, Les.
Uh, listen, it's perfectly natural.
We've been under a lot of strain, all of us.
What you need is some rest, huh?
Right.
You just get some sack time there.
Take it easy, huh?
Good.
Jeannie.
You can come out now.
Whoo.
Whoo-hoo.
Hello.
Whoo.
Jeannie.
Oh, Jeannie.
Well?
What?
She's not here.
I can't find her anyplace.
Maybe she's in my room.
Jeannie.
Jeannie, come out!
Shh.
Shh.
Wingate is right through that door.
Don't think he's alone.
What?
In the closet.
I saw it.
I saw it.
I saw it.
In the closet.
Take it easy.
What's the matter?
Don't tell me to take it easy.
We've got an extraterrestrial creature on our hands, and I'll prove it.
That's ridiculous.
Now, hold it.
Maybe he's got a point.
Yeah, maybe.
What?
Look, for years, the scientists have been telling us that sooner or later, we'll meet up with an extraterrestrial creature.
I think it might be safe to assume that we've met one a little sooner than we thought we would.
We have.
We have, Tony.
We have.
I saw it.
I know you saw it.
But, Les, you're the only one who has.
You need corroboration.
I'm going in there.
No.
No, no.
No, no, Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
Tony.
It may be hostile.
I think you're getting a little hostile, Les.
I am sorry, master.
I thought it was your room.
See anything?
Not yet.
It's on the shelf.
On the, uh On the left-hand side.
Is this what you saw, Les?
Where'd you get the trophy?
It's Les's mission souvenir.
It says, "Commander Leslie Wingate, lunar module pilot".
That is not what I saw.
The creature I saw was about Was about 6 inches long, had blond hair, and was wearing a black dress.
I didn't know they gave out trophies.
Why?
Why didn't I get a trophy?
This is 6 inches long, and in the dark, you can't tell the difference between gold and blond.
You think he'll buy it?
I don't know.
How much are you asking?
I knew.
I I shouldn't have gone up with you guys.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Take it easy.
On our last mission I saw a girl sitting next to me in the command module wearing a harem outfit.
Can you guys convince me that I was having raptures of deep space?
Well?
Huh?
Get the sleeping pills in there.
Look, I want you to lie down and just get a lot of sleep.
Les, you're exhausted.
I just want to know, why is it when I'm around you two guys, I start seeing things?
Why?
Well Here, Les.
Here.
Take those.
Take your sleeping pills.
Oh, no.
N-no sleeping pills.
I get an upset stomach.
Les, that's better than an upset head.
That's That's That's true.
Oh.
Shh, darling.
All right, you can stop apologizing.
I forgive you.
Oh, thank you, master.
You are most generous.
Yeah.
But We There's no way to fix it now.
Once you came in contact with me, you were contaminated.
Contaminated!
Shh.
I mean, possibly contaminated by any of the germs I brought back from the moon.
You're just gonna have to stay here the whole 21 days.
Oh.
Oh, I know, master.
That is terrible.
I cannot think of a punishment severe enough for one as stupid as I. Now, all right.
All right.
Don't overdo it.
Just stay out of sight.
Especially from Wingate, huh?
Oh, yes, master.
I know.
That poor man.
About to become a new papa too.
Yeah.
Hey, I tell you what.
Hey.
See if you can pop yourself into an outfit that looks like this, huh?
Why, certainly, master.
Hm.
Of course, gold is not my best color.
Perhaps emerald green would look better.
Mm.
T-try Try gold.
It It'll look nice on you.
Mm.
Blue?
Gold.
Oh.
Yes, master.
Okay.
Gold is not my color.
It looks great.
It really does.
Now Now, uh Uh, pop yourself into this size.
Yes, master.
Okay.
Like this, master?
Yeah.
If Wingate catches a glimpse of you, he'll think you're the trophy.
Must I stay like this all the time?
Yeah, yeah.
You must stay there unless we're absolutely sure we're alone.
Master.
I was thinking.
Yeah?
Since I am here Hm?
And we are alone.
Yeah.
A And I am contaminated.
What is it?
Can we risk further contamination?
Yeah, why not?
All right.
Extraterrestrial.
No, no.
No, no.
Oh-ho Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Sally.
Sally.
Oh.
Baby.
Boy.
Boy.
Girl.
Girl.
Bye-bye.
Oh.
For heaven's sakes.
It is very difficult being a trophy.
Amanda, it's nearly 2:00 in the morning, and these men need their sleep.
Alfred, I don't care.
Now, Commander Wingate has just become the father of a beautiful baby boy, and I intend to tell him.
Amanda.
I still say it can wait till morning.
And I say, Alfred, that Commander Wingate has been cooped up in there probably worried to death about his wife.
And I think we should just tell him that everything is fine.
Oh.
Oh!
I will never get any sleep around here.
Amanda.
Mm-hm?
Do you see what I see?
Oh.
Alfred.
It's It's a little, tiny creature in a gold suit waving its antennae at us.
This is a very historic moment.
Our first contact with extraterrestrial beings.
I think I'm gonna faint.
Alfred, it's gone.
Incredible.
Evidently it has the power to dematerialize at will.
What's the matter?
What happened?
Major Nelson, Major Healey.
The most amazing thing.
There is life on the moon.
It's right over there at the end of the couch.
Huh?
On the end of the couch.
Well, wait a minute, sir.
We don't understand what you're talking about.
I do.
We just came back from the hospital, and we found out that Commander Wingate's wife had the baby.
And then we looked into the room, and right over there, we saw Hey.
Sally had the baby!
How about that!
A-a A boy or a girl?
A boy, and she's fine.
But Hey, a boy.
We gotta tell the commander, huh?
What happened?
What happened?
I just woke up Oh.
Les, it's happened.
It's happened, Les.
Oh, you mean you found the creature?
He has seen it too.
Huh?
No, uh, you You had a boy.
Sally had a boy.
Sally had a boy.
Yeah.
Sally had a boy.
Yeah Sally had a boy Oh!
Oh!
Oh.
Oh.
What?
What, is she?
Is she okay?
She's fine, commander.
Congratulations.
Commander.
Commander, a few seconds ago, you asked about a creature.
He was asleep, sir.
He didn't know what he was saying.
Yeah, he was asleep.
Gentlemen, please.
Let the commander speak.
Commander, see, we saw it too.
It's about 8 inches long, had a gold suit, and was sitting right over Oh, that.
Listen, relax, Dr. and Mrs. Bellows.
It was nothing.
Nothing?
We saw it.
I saw it too.
And I was pretty shook up at first, until Tony showed me what it was.
We had a lot of laughs over it.
I don't know what's going on.
Uh Do you mean to tell me you three saw this thing, and And you're not upset?
I'll show you.
He'll show it to you.
Hey.
At least I'm not the only one who made the same mistake, huh?
Yeah.
It's funny what nerves can do.
Yeah, my nerves are getting pretty funny.
My nerves.
A boy, huh?
Uh, did Sally give it a name yet?
Uh, well, no How?
How much did it weigh?
Dr. and Mrs. Bellows, is this what you saw?
A trophy.
Oh, but it looks sort of like what we saw, only what we saw moved.
That's ridiculous.
Uh, trophies don't move, Mrs. Bellows.
Exactly.
Then how did it get to wherever Commander Wingate found it?
Yeah, Tony.
H-how did?
How did?
How did that happen?
Well, it's just an ordinary trophy.
It's got a oh!
Oh!
Whoa.
What happened?
What's going on down there?
I'm sorry.
I dropped your statue.
Sorry.
Jeannie, are you all right?
Major Nelson.
Yes?
Come back here.
I want to see that trophy.
I can't, sir.
It's broken.
Well, it's a little late, so good night.
Just a moment, Major Healey.
We're going to get to the bottom of this, and now.
Yeah, well, uh All right, sir.
What do we?
What do we discuss?
Uh, commander.
Tell us everything that happened.
Jeannie.
Darling, say something.
Tell me what's wrong, please.
Oh.
Darling, are you all right?
Oh.
Oh Oh.
What's the matter?
Oh, I have a terrible headache.
Oh.
Uh, there are some, uh, headache pills in the bathroom.
Oh.
Uh, go in there, and I I want you to stay there until e-everybody goes to sleep, okay?
Gently.
Yes, master.
You all right?
Yes.
Gently.
Okay.
Stay there.
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Ow!
Oh.
Tony?
Yeah.
Oh, hey, Tony.
Uh, how's Jeannie?
She's okay.
She's just got a little headache.
What's going on out there?
Don't worry.
I fixed everything.
The Bellows thought they saw something, and it made Wingate suspicious.
I knew that was gonna happen.
And Dr. Bellows was gonna call General Schaeffer.
You're kidding.
Oh Don't worry.
You'll be proud of me.
I fixed everything.
I I told Dr. Bellows no use panicking everybody over something he's not sure of.
Yeah, yeah.
Dr. Bellows is gonna have the sterilization crew come in tomorrow and search everything.
What?
Jeannie can make herself teeny-tiny again Oh, great.
That's all we need.
That was stupendous.
That was a great idea.
Master?
Huh?
Oh, these are funny headache pills.
I took two of them and I feel so sleepy.
Wait, Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Darling.
We have to Darling.
What's the matter?
Jeannie?
Hold it.
Wake up.
Sweetheart.
Wait a minute.
These aren't headache pills.
They're sleeping pills.
Wingate took two of these, and he was out for eight hours.
Oh, night-night, Jeannie.
The sterilization crew, when is it coming?
Six o'clock in the morning.
Oh, that's great.
You got any idea how we're gonna hide a 110-pound genie?
I don't know, but she'd make a big trophy.
No, Amanda.
I still don't know why you insisted on being here.
Because, Alfred, I saw it the first time.
And if it's here, I intend to see it again.
Well, they certainly didn't find anything in this part of the lab.
They've gone over it with a fine-toothed comb.
Oh, Alfred.
I wonder how they all feel in there.
I mean, you know, being cooped up with a creature from another planet.
Well, as far as Major Nelson is concerned, I sometimes wonder whether he's of another world.
Well, I like to keep a clean isolation lab.
That's it, guys, huh?
Out the door we go.
Where you going, fellas?
Wait a minute.
That's Major Nelson's room.
Uh, don't go in there.
Major Major Nelson's sleeping.
Be quiet when you're in there, because he's sleeping, fellas.
Very quiet.
Very quiet, major.
Sleepy-sleepy.
Oh.
Carry on.
Tony.
Listen, I want Shh.
Uh, Tony's asleep.
But he was just in the hall.
Yeah.
W-was he in the hall?
Oh, that was me in the hall.
But But if you're here, then who was that in the hall?
Oh, you're right.
That was me in the hall.
Have you seen the trophy?
I wanna take a look at it.
No, I haven't seen it, Les.
Maybe it's in your closet.
Yeah, maybe it's in the closet, Les.
Oh.
Nice job.
No.
Nope.
Uh, no.
No.
Maybe it's in your closet.
Yeah maybe it's in my closet, Les.
No, Les.
Wait a minute, Les.
It's not in my closet.
Les?
Tony.
But Ro Roger said you were sleeping.
Yeah, I was.
It was quieter in here.
Well, that makes sense.
But I But if you're here, who's sleeping in your bed?
Goldilocks?
Wait a minute.
You don't wanna go in there.
The sterilization crew's in there.
Get out of my way.
Somebody's in your bed.
No, that's all your imagination.
I've had about enough of my My imagination.
Whoa.
Wait.
Wait.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
Oh, boy.
Those short naps are refreshing.
But you said you were Tony.
Roger, that's Tony.
And you're Wingate.
I know who I am.
I know who you are.
What I want to know is, who was in this bed?
Move, Nelson.
Nelson, you're forgetting something.
I outrank you.
Yeah, well Get out of the way!
All right.
I found it!
I found it!
I found it!
Jeannie.
Get him!
Get him.
Don't go away.
Now, come on, Roger.
Roger.
And you authorized the sterilization crew.
Yes, sir.
And I take full responsibility.
May I ask why?
General, you're not gonna believe this.
I mean, you won't believe it, but last night, I saw, on this couch a tiny little creature uh, about 6 inches long, with a With a gold suit waving.
A tiny little creature waving.
That's right, sir.
I saw it too.
I found it!
I found it!
Oh.
Oh, in Major Nelson's room.
Do you see, sir?
What did you find, commander?
The creature, sir.
The creature.
It It's huge.
It's over 5 feet tall.
And it's wearing a gold astronaut's uniform.
And it's hiding in Major Nelson's closet.
Don't listen.
Lack of sleep.
He's overwrought.
Yeah, it's the baby, sir.
It's the strain Silence!
Five feet tall, commander?
Six inches, doctor?
It must have grown.
Oh.
Here they are, general.
Well, gentlemen.
Anything happen?
Not a thing, doctor.
Clean as a whistle.
But But I saw it.
In In In Major Nelson's room.
I  Are you sure?
We checked everywhere, but we can go over it again if you like.
No, that won't be necessary.
Uh, gentlemen you're going to have to be in the isolation chamber for three weeks.
That's a long time, but it will seem considerably longer if you let your imaginations run away with you.
Now, I suggest that you all forget about this, uh This creature, and get some rest.
But general, now, you can get And my suggestion goes for you too, Mrs. Bellows.
General, wait.
Mm-hm?
I just heard that the sterilization crew has been in the isolation lab.
Can you tell me why?
Mm-hm.
It was the maid's day off.
It's okay.
You just need a little rest.
I need a little rest.
Boy.
You'll be back on your feet in no time.
Three weeks.
Never make it three weeks.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Djinn-Djinn, is that you?
You stop it this instant, you naughty dog.
Oh, you adorable little puppy, I am so happy to see you.
But you will not be able to stay if you insist on attacking my master's uniforms.
Djinn-Djinn, where?
Oh!
Djinn-Djinn, what is the matter?
Are you attacking me now?
Djinn-Djinn.

Hello.
Oh, hello, darling?
Hi, uh, I forgot that file I was working on last night and I was wondering if you'd?
Oh, oh, oh, yes, of course, master.
It is in the bedroom.
I-I will blink it to you.
No, no.
No, no.
Don't blink it to me.
I'm in the conference room.
Uh, I just wanted to tell you Roger's gonna be by and pick it up in a few minutes.
Uh, what's that noise?
Oh.
Heh.
Oh, well, it, uh It is a friend who Who dropped by to say hello to me.
A friend?
What do you mean "a friend"?
Uh, major, excuse me, is that, uh, Jeannie?
I'd like to talk to her.
Jeannie, this is Dr. Bellows.
I just wanted to tell you that your dinner the other night was marvelous.
Uh, uh, Jeannie, I-I know who the friend is and I want him out of the house by the time I get home, huh?
And hide my uniforms.
But master, he is a sweet No.
That's final.
What's the matter with Jeannie?
She positively barked at me.
She's not feeling very well right now, sir.
Shall we get on with our business?
Djinn-Djinn, I am sorry, darling puppy, but I am afraid you are going to have to go home.
Djinn-Djinn, I am talking to you.
What is it, Djinn-Djinn?
What is the matter, Djinn-Djinn?
Do you wanna go in the bedroom?
Okay.
Let's go.
Oh, I do not understand.
What?
Oh, Djinn-Djinn, how marvelous.
You are going to be a father.
Just dog vitamins and that is all?
Oh, thank you, doctor.
Thank you very much.
Oh, no, no, no.
Please do not bother.
I shall get them myself.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.
These are for you.
Now, let me see.
Oh, that box will never do.
There, that will do for a start.
Yes, Mommy.
Now, let me see.
What else?
Ah.
There we are, blankets.
Come, Djinn-Djinn.
I think we should let the expectant mother get some rest, hm?
Okay.
There you are, Djinn-Djinn.
Well, expectant fathers must keep up their strength too.
Hm.
Oh, Anthony will be so pleased.
I hope.
Jeannie, you home?
Oh, come in, Major Healy.
Major Healy.
Oh, did, uh, Tony call about the file?
File?
Yeah, file.
Oh.
Oh, oh, y Yes.
It is in the bedroom.
Oh, yeah, thanks.
On the table.
Right.
Oh, I am worrying for nothing.
Anthony could not possibly turn out an expectant mother.
Hm.
Pretty.
"Vitamins for Pregnancy".
Oh.
Vit  Oh.
I'm gonna be an uncle.
I'm gonna be an uncle.
Oh, that Jeannie.
Ho.
Did you see?
Oh, did I see.
Oh, congratulations.
I'm so happy for you.
Oh, thank you.
It is wonderful, is it not?
Oh, wonderful.
It's the most exciting news I ever heard in my whole life.
When's it gonna happen?
Well, I'm not sure, exactly.
Yeah, well, if there's anything old Roge can do, be sure to just Just ask me.
Oh, how about that guy?
Sly old dog.
Oh, ho, ho.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Well, Djinn-Djinn is not so old.
Now, before we go any further, gentlemen, I've had a request from the public relations people.
They'd like us to give this project a name.
Isn't that a little premature, sir?
No, no, they want to start briefing the news agencies on what we're planning.
Now, uh, ahem, any suggestions?
Well?
I have one.
Since this is to be the most far-ranging of our probes, how about calling it "Operation Pluto"?
I think that's very appropriate, sir.
Thank you.
Thank you, major.
Ahem.
I've, uh Heh.
I've always had a flair for names.
Psst.
Oh, thanks, Roge.
That's okay, "Dad".
Huh?
Dad, Daddy, Da-Da.
Frankly, I'm partial to Da-Da.
What are you talking about, Roge?
Have you decided on a name yet?
Mm, yeah, were gonna call it Pluto.
"Pluto Nelson".
Yeah.
Well, it's different.
Uh, here you are, sir, I wish you'd, uh Would you hand those out?
Gladly, major.
Thank you.
Uh, would you mind explaining yourself, Roge?
You wanna make the announcement now?
What are you talking about?
You know: You, the baby and Jeannie.
Heh.
What?
Yeah.
Uh, sir, would you excuse me just a moment, please?
I have a kind of a personal matter.
Dr. Bellows, when did Major Nelson have his last checkup?
Two weeks ago, sir, and I'm beginning to believe he's due for another one.
Sir, may I have permission to be excused, please?
Permission denied.
I wanna talk to you.
Sir, all the information is in the fathers Files.
Files.
Major Healy, for heaven's sake, would you kindly tell me what you've just told Major Nelson?
Sorry, sir.
Oh, nothing, sir.
Actually I think he would rather tell you himself.
Dr. Bellows, are you sure Major Nelson's in condition to handle Pluto?
About that name, sir, don't you think a more appropriate name would be James or Tom or?
Or maybe even Seymour?
Major Healy, the United States is not sending out a space probe called "Operation Seymour".
Haw about "Irving"?
Jeannie?
Darling?
Darling?
Oh.
There is Anthony.
Now, you two stay here, uh, until I explain everything.
All right?
Stay.
Jeannie.
Hello, master.
Hello, darling.
How are you feeling?
Are you well?
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm feeling just fine.
But there is something I wish to talk to you about.
I know, I know.
That's why I brought you these.
Oh, they are beautiful.
Thank you, darling.
Oh, you're so beautiful.
I I guess it's true what they say about women.
They're so beautiful when Did you say you knew?
Yes, Roger told me.
Oh, and you're not angry?
Angry?
Oh, I'm the happiest man in the world.
Oh, well, I am so relieved.
Ha, ha.
Do you want me to get you something?
Get you something to eat or drink or anything?
Well, I-I was going to blink up some dog biscuits.
Dog biscuits?
Mm.
I-I thought you'd want some pickles or ice cream or something.
Ice cream and pickles.
Master, there is something I must tell you.
Oh, and I can't wait to hear it from your sweet little lips.
Tell me.
Go ahead.
A baby!
A dog?
A baby!
Oh, Mrs. Djinn-Djinn is going to have puppies.
Yeah, not in my house, she's not gonna have them.
Master!
Darling, I have enough trouble with one lunatic mongrel around shredding all my uniforms.
Where'd he go?
My uniforms.
My uniforms!
Do something!
Oh.
Oh, everything is all right now, master.
It is not all right.
It's not even beginning to be all right.
I-I-I can't have two magical mutts in this house.
Wait a minute, uh, she is magical, isn't she?
Forget I asked.
Master, I cannot believe that you would send an expectant mother out into the cold, cruel snow.
It is not snowing.
It will be if you send her out.
Now, Jeannie.
Now, look, I-I am not a heartless monster.
I like animals.
I like 'em a lot.
But I can't afford to have two of these things around.
Just think: Warm, cuddly, darling little puppies.
And magic.
Squiggly, wiggly little puppies.
Magic puppies.
Oh, puppies.
Oh, when I think of eight or 10 magic puppies, I can't believe it.
Puppies.
Hi, anybody home?
Uncle Roger's here.
"Uncle Roger".
Ha, ha, ha.
Is he in for a surprise.
Finish it, Mrs. Djinn-Djinn.
Remember, you are eating for two.
Ha, ha.
Or four.
Or eight?
Hi, Roge, what you got?
Yeah.
Present for the little mother.
Where is she?
In the kitchen, eating her horse meat.
Oh.
Horse meat?
Horse meat?
Boy, I've heard of cravings, but horse meat?
Whew.
Roger, I don't want to disappoint you, but we're not having a baby.
You're not?
No.
No, we are having puppies.
Puppies?
No wonder you kept it a secret.
No, Djinn-Djinn.
Djinn-Djinn?
Oh, he really is magic.
Oh, Mrs. Djinn-Djinn.
Is it not wonderful?
Yeah, wonderful.
Well, I, uh, hope she likes chocolate-covered cherries.
Roger, nobody's to know about this.
Uh, Mrs. Djinn-Djinn is just as magic as Mr. Djinn-Djinn.
Mum's the word then.
The thing is there's some blabbermouth  I'll get it, I'll get it.
You go in the kitchen with the dogs.
I didn't say anything, but Huh?
See, somebody at the office Oh, major, congratulations, We just found out.
I think it's wonderful.
Mrs. Bellows, I I Oh, don't call me Mrs. Bellows.
Call me Auntie Amanda.
Oh, I just love the sound of that.
Well, the only one who's allowed to call me Uncle Alfred is the little one, uh, when he or she arrives.
How about "Uncle Ruff".
I-I think there's been a little misunderstanding.
Oh, Alfred, how adorable.
Aw.
Uh, uh, Mrs. Bellows.
How about "Uncle Bark"?
Oh, marvelous.
Yeah, Mrs. Bellows, we're not having a baby.
This is This stuff is just a gift for our friend.
Hello, what's this?
Well.
Ha-ha.
"For pregnancy, one tablet a day".
Are these for a friend too, major?
Yes.
Major, I'm afraid your secret's out and were all very happy.
Uh, Mrs. Bellows, it's not what you think.
Really.
Where's Jeannie?
We'd like to congratulate her too.
Oh, she's in the kitchen, Dr. Bellows.
Roger!
Uh, Jeannie, the Bellows are coming.
I mean, they're here.
Oh, well, Dr. and Mrs. Bellows, how nice of you to drop by.
Jeannie, you look marvelous.
Positively radiant.
Well, heh, I do?
Uh, Roger, what if Mrs. Bellows and Dr. Bellows see those two?
Don't ask me to get rid of the dogs.
What do you mean, don't ask you?
I mean, don't ask me.
Hey.
Hey, they're here.
Help me get rid of 'em, will you?
Yeah.
One of them's gone already.
Where'd he go?
Djinn-Djinn?
Oh.
Huh?
The uniforms!
Go!
Hurry!
Whoa, whoa!
Shh-shh!
You don't have anything to worry about, Mrs. Djinn-Djinn.
Would you mind just?
Mrs. Djinn-Djinn?
Well, at least you don't have anything about uniforms, huh?
Waagh!
Ah!
Aagh!
What on earth was all that racket?
Uh, the neighbors.
The neighbors.
Hm?
They They are very noisy.
Dr. Bellows, Mrs. Bellows, please, you must believe me.
Oh, Jeannie we will believe anything you want us to believe.
Now, Jeannie, you drink plenty of fluids and stay off your feet.
Yes, and say goodbye to Major Nelson and Major Healey for us, won't you?
Oh, certainly.
Come, Alfred.
Hm.
My feet?
Jeannie!
Jeannie, help us, please!
What's going on?
Master.
You should not play with Mrs. Djinn-Djinn like that.
She should not exert herself.
Who's playing with Djinn-Djinn?
Playing?
I had her horse meat.
That's why she was having a panic or something.
And him with the uniforms.
Alfred, what?
What do you think?
Perfectly common first-child syndrome.
It's such a big event in their lives, they don't know quite how to handle it.
Alfred, of course.
Like when you proposed to me and then made me promise not to tell anybody about it.
Amanda.
Oh.
Alfred, I've got a marvelous idea.
Why don't we throw them a surprise baby shower?
Then that way they'll know that all their friends want to help.
You know, Amanda, sometimes you're positively brilliant.
We'll invite the whole base.
Okay.
Extraordinary, isn't it?
Here, the man has been to the moon and back and yet he's afraid of a perfectly normal thing like having a baby.
I assure you, general, it's quite typical.
Well, now, I'll tell you, I think this surprise baby shower is just the thing.
You know, it'll give him confidence.
Well, it wouldn't a bad thing for the space program either.
Put some heart into it.
Uh, be sure the public relations people are there.
Excellent idea, sir.
Excellent.
All right, now, let's see.
We have Commander Spencer and Major Eastlake, and of course, the Johnsons.
Oh, and we won't tell Major Healey until the very last minute.
Oh, he's so close to Major Nelson he's sure to spill the beans.
Uh, get some of the congressmen from the appropriations committee.
One thing they can't say no to is motherhood.
Goodbye, husband.
Goodbye.
Have a good day.
Any idea how soon?
Not yet.
But I do not think it is very far off.
She is very listless.
You call me if anything happens.
Oh, I will.
Okay.
There.
Amazing, general.
Heh-heh-heh.
Well, I didn't major in physics for nothing.
Quick, everybody, Major Nelson's coming.
Hide.
Hide the  Hurry, hurry.
Come on.
Oh, I'm sorry, gentlemen, I didn't know you were having a meeting.
Oh, that's quite all right, major.
We were just, uh Just Uh-uh-uh, just discussing the, uh The moisture condensation control filter of the new KR3 space helmet.
Oh.
I do not know what is wrong with Mrs. Djinn-Djinn, master.
She has not eaten a thing all day.
Yeah, well, I think I know what's the matter.
I'll bet you by tonight we hear the pitter-patter of little paws, huh?
Oh, master.
Hm-hm.
You know, if the way you've taken care of Mrs. Djinn-Djinn is any indication, one of these days you're gonna make a great mother.
You mean I will have puppies too?
Our rendezvous will be at 1840 hours around the corner under the elm trees.
Oh, uh, by the way, has anybody briefed Major Healy?
Oh, there's no need, sir.
He'll be there for dinner anyway, Good, he can be surprised too then.
Uh, Lieutenant Hoffman, you all set?
Uh, yes, sir.
Gentleman, the first wave of shower guests will hit the doorstep at 1900 hours sharp.
Now, synchronize watches.
Boy, I can't take much more of this.
When?
When do you think it'll happen?
How should I know?
I never had puppies before.
Oh, I think it's happening.
What's going on?
Not yet.
Hey, maybe we better get a vet, huh?
Oh, great idea.
"Uh, doctor, this is Mr. and Mrs. Djinn-Djinn.
They're genie dogs from Baghdad".
Well, I could call in Louis Pasteur or Florence Nightingale.
Yeah, well if they're vets, maybe we better call 'em.
Oh, Djinn-Djinn, do not worry.
Everything will be all right.
I will be right back.
Boy, I've I've never had a dog before.
Shhhh.
All systems go.
Five, four, three, two, one.
Go!
Surprise!
Surprise.
Are you surprised, major?
Oh, you might say that, yes, sir.
Well, uh, wh?
What's this all about?
It's a baby shower, old father-to-be.
A shower, oh.
Yeah.
Well Hey, Jeannie, you're gonna have a baby shower.
Not now, Now now, Major Healy.
Mrs. Djinn-Djinn is going to have her puppies.
Thank you very much.
I can't tell you how we appreciate Oh, don't thank us, major.
We're a team at NASA.
All for one, and one for all.
Oh, now tell me where is the darling mother-to-be?
In the kitchen washing dishes.

Jeannie says it's time.
Boil some water.
Don't touch me.
Don't touch me.
For what?
It's all right.
It's not what you think, sir.
It couldn't be time.
She doesn't even show.
Don't worry, son, we can handle it.
If they need boiling water, it's too late for an ambulance.
Call a doctor.
No, no.
Yes, call a doctor.
Yes, call a doctor.
Alfred, you are a doctor.
Not that kind of a doctor.
I don't care what kind of a doctor you are, Alfred, go get your bag immediately.
I'm going to help Jeannie.
No, it's all right.
Roger's in there.
Major, what kind of a man are you?
Your wife is in that kitchen having your baby.
Get out of my way!
It's all right.
Roger's in there with her.
Roger isn't a doctor.
I know.
More hot towels.

Ah.
For heaven's sake, major, didn't you know your wife was this close?
She's not, she's not.
Ah!
Oh, it's a male, it's a male.
She just went into labor five minutes ago.
It's all right.
No, no, no, no.
You all stay right there.
Everything's under control.
There's no reason for anybody to get upset.
It's all right, Jeannie.
I'm coming.
No, it's all right.
Number two, a female.
Huh?
Twins, already?
Jeannie, I'm coming.
It's all right, it's all right.
Roger's in there.
Do you realize that your wife is just having twins and there's no doctor in attendance?
It's all right.
Triplets, triplets!
Heh-heh.
Quads.
What's happening?
It's all right.
I'd like to Listen, if you'll all be quiet, I can explain the whole thing.
You see the babies The babies are beautiful, all six of them.
Six?
Puppies?
Puppies?
Yes.
You mean, I bought a teddy bear for a dog shower?
Thank you.
Where's Djinn-Djinn?
Wait a minute, more hot towels.
What for?
Your face.
All over your face.
I've never been through a thing like this in my life.
I'm excited.
Do you realize that there are uniforms out there?
Don't worry about Djinn-Djinn.
He's so exhausted from being a father, he won't be able to pull off any magic.
Huh?
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
The whole side.
Beautiful.
Aw.
Mrs. Bellows, are you all right?
Hey.

Oh, aren't they adorable?
Oh, Jeannie, may I have one, please?
Now, just a moment.
That's a great idea.
I'd like one too, Jeannie.
How about one for the base mascot?
Oh Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
It was a nice thought.
Thank you.
I-I'll return those presents tomorrow.
Oh, darling, why do we not donate them to a children's hospital?
Oh, yes.
That's a marvelous idea, Jeannie.
Be sure to send a public relations man along.
Yes.
All right.
Good night.
Good night.
And thanks again.
Here.
I forgot these.
Oh, sorry.
No more house calls.
Good night.
Good night.
Phew.
Ha-ha-ha.
Darling, look, a-about the puppies.
You can't give those people a puppy.
I mean, it's impossible.
Can you imagine what would happen?
Oh, do not worry, darling.
It is all arranged.
Well, you'll just have to unarrange it.
Can you imagine what would happen if we populated Cocoa Beach with, uh, magic puppies?
Now, let's see.
This one is for Uncle Azmire.
This one is for Aunt Melama.
This one is for cousin No, no, no, no.
That's Azmire, this is Melama.

{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
I wonder where she is.
Not far.
I wish she wouldn't leave this stuff around.
Um, hey, Jeannie.
Hey, what do you think Dr. Bellows is coming over for?
I don't know.
He was pretty pleasant on the phone.
Bellows pleasant?
You must be in trouble.
He called me "Tony, old friend".
Yeah, well, big trouble.
Jeannie, would you come out please?
That must be Dr. Bellows.
Uh, uh Stay in there.
It's Dr. Bellows.
Yes, master?
Jeannie, d-don't come out.
Dr. Bellows is here.
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.
Good afternoon.
Hello, hello, major.
You mind if I don't get up?
Uh, we know it's a lot to ask, major, but it's just 'till tomorrow afternoon.
You see, we're going to a medical convention.
Oh, but don't worry.
He won't be any trouble.
My nephew is a joy to have around.
Your nephew?
Melvin, would you get out of the rose beds, dear?
Is that your nephew?
Yes, that's he, yes.
We don't have any children.
I don't know if Jeannie can handle this.
I would too.
Oh, but listen, he is a darling boy with a very active imagination.
You will just love him, you really will.
Melvin?
Mel Alfred, I-I can't see him.
You don't think he's run away again, do you?
Oh I hope so.
Oh, I'm sorry about this.
Uh, sir?
Oh, boy.
Oh, here he is.
Uncle Alfred!
Uncle Alfred!
I just saw a lady come out of this bottle.
You did not.
Shh.
I did too!
There was a whole bunch of smoke and everything.
Now, Melvin, you shouldn't make up stories.
Alfred, now, I don't know.
If the boy said that he saw something Oh, it's those comic books.
He reads so many of them they've affected his brain.
But I did!
I did see it!
There was smoke and a lady and everything.
She came out of the bottle.
Well, if you saw her, where is she?
I don't know, but I saw smoke!
Shh.
Hello?
Hello, Major Healey.
Good timing.
Jeannie, hello.
This is my nephew, uh, Melvin.
And we're going to impose on you terribly and ask you to take care of him, but just for one day.
Oh, we would love to, Mrs. Bellows, of course.
How do you do, Melvin?
Melvin, it isn't polite to stare.
Yes, ma'am.
How do you do, Mrs. Nelson?
Well, we have to run.
Thank you again.
Yes, we're just going to go get his things.
Where have you been?
I'll help you.
Come on, Roger.
Hey, look at the chair!
It's going up  A little chocolate, huh?
Yeah, and pineapple.
Pineapple.
Pineapple, oh, yeah.
And Strawberry.

Right on top, the strawberries.
How about a little whipped cream?
Whipped cream.
Some nuts.
Nuts, nuts, nuts.
There you are.
A few cherries.
A few cherries.
Right you are.
Coming up.
How about three, hm?
Three cherries.
One, two, three.
Good?
Oops, sorry.
Ha-ha, ha.
You just eat up now, and have a good time.
Mr. Nelson?
Mm-hm?
Where'd you get that weird bottle and that chair?
Well, a chair's a chair, and a bottle's a bottle, you know.
Mm-hm.
Have a good time, kid.
Sure is a weird chair.
Yeah, there's plenty more where that came from.
Ah-ha.
Y-you are annoyed with me?
Now, where'd you get that idea?
Well, I'm sorry, master, but I did not know that he was there.
If that little boy finds out you're a genie, I am dead.
Dead, you understand?
Tell me you love me.
This is important.
You do not love me.
Oh, of course I love you.
Oh, you do not love me.
I do!
I do!
Oh, you love me!
Jeannie.
No more magic while he's around.
You understand that?
Yes, master.
Oh, but m-m-m-m-master.
What?
No buts.
But But master No, no.
Master!
Do something.
Not that.
I'm ready for bed.
Oh, I will be right up.
Thank goodness.
I hope he sleeps 12 hours.
Oh, master, he's really a very nice little boy.
Hm?
Oh, yeah, he's a nice little boy all right.
He is also suspicious, curious and creepy, and a threat to my existence.
That kid believes in witches and warlocks and genies and that kind of nonsense.
Master.
Oh, you know what I mean.
Well, perhaps I will tell him a bedtime story.
Mm.
Let me see.
Maybe Ali Baba and the 38 Thieves, hm?
Forty.
No.
It was 38, master.
I was there.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
I'll tell him the story.
Well, let's see now, there's a lot of great stories.
You got any favorites?
Yeah, the one about the genie.
The what?
Aladdin and His Magic Lamp.
Uh, gee, I don't think I know that one.
Oh, I do.
Uh, it's coming back to me now.
You sure you want that one?
It's my favorite.
Oh, ha-ha, okay.
All right.
Ahem.
Uh, lets see now.
Once upon a time, there was a little boy and one day he was walking along this This beach.
Oh, it was the forest.
No, darling, it was a beach.
Forest.
Beach.
Beach.
It was the beach, Mrs. Nelson.
I read it a lot.
Yeah.
A Aladdin was Was, uh, walking along this long beach, see?
And he  And found, uh, uh, uh, there in the sand was this This, uh, lamp.
Old, beat-up, rusty, ancient-looking lamp.
See?
So and he knew that if he picked it up and polished it that, uh, he could sell it at the bazaar.
And so he rubbed it and rubbed it and rubbed it, and all of a sudden this This huge genie appeared.
Uncle Punjab!
Yeah.
This huge genie appeared.
Punjab is his name.
And, uh, Punjab said Ow!
Ow.
Oh, hello, darling.
You are home early.
Yeah, I got home as soon as I could.
Well, how's Melvin?
Everything going okay?
Terrible.
Huh?
I have to cook dinner.
I mean actually cook it without magic.
We are all liable to die.
No, it'll be great.
Uh, what's the little devil doing?
I do not know.
What do you mean you don't know?
Hey, Melvin, how are you doing, buddy?
Ha-ha.
There's something strange about this bottle.
Huh?
Nah, that's just a plain old, ordinary bottle.
I wonder if I rubbed it I'd get a wish.
Huh?
Uh, no, no.
Ah, go ahead, give it a try.
I wish I had a lot of new toys.
Oh, hi, Melvin.
I brought you a lot of new toys.
It worked!
It worked!
That was just a coincidence.
What did you bring those here for?
To take his mind off the bottle.
Oh, no, no, that's mine.
That one's mine.
Hey, Major Nelson.
Ow!
Airplane!
Oh, yeah.
Where are they?
It's almost 8:00.
Don't worry.
Dr. Bellows will be over in a few minutes and everything will be all right.
Yeah, not a moment too soon.
Think it's all right leaving that kid out with Jeannie?
Yeah, she's got orders to keep his mind off the bottle.
Oh, boy!
Oh, my Yay!
You have hit the eye of the bull again, Melvin.
Is this not fun?
I can't miss.
And all because I rubbed a bottle and made a wish.
Oh, no, no.
It had nothing to do with the bottle.
Oh, yes it did.
Oh, hello, darling.
Hello.
Would you like a turn?
No.
No, thanks.
Uh, Melvin, your aunt and uncle are gonna be here pretty soon.
You better go on inside and wait for them, huh?
Okay.
Wait 'till I tell 'em.
Yeah.
You were supposed to make him forget about the bottle.
Oh, I-I did, master.
That is why we were playing darts.
Y But you kept blinking and moving the dartboard in front of the darts.
Oh, but he could not hit it any other way, master.
And you said to make him happy.
Yes, hon, but without magic.
Now, can't you do anything right?
Well, I-I was doing my best.
Yeah, well, your best is a catastrophe.
Look at this.
Very well, then, I will leave him to you.
Honestly, I-I Jeannie?
Now, now, now, now, don't get angry.
Jeannie?
Mm-hm.
Jeannie!
Well, thank you again, major, for looking after Melvin.
It's been our pleasure, sir.
It has?
Yeah.
It has.
It has.
And say goodbye to Jeannie for us, won't you?
I certainly will.
Well, come along, Melvin.
So long, Melvin.
Bye.
Thanks a lot.
Come back again.
Sure!
Why did you say that?
Ah, it just slipped out.
Well, thank goodness that kid's gone.
Uh, Jeannie, it's safe now.
You can come out.
Jeannie?
Come along, Melvin.
I'm coming.
It was great.
They got instant-growing flowers that just pop up.
Then I wished for some toys and there they were.
And they got this magic dartboard that moves right in front of your dart so you can't miss.
Don't you believe me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Of course we believe you.
And then I suppose the nice lady came out of the bottle again in a cloud of smoke.
No, sir.
She went back in.
And I got her.
Oh!
What?
Now, that is a naughty boy.
Now, you know that belongs to the Nelsons.
But the lady's inside.
I'll bet she's a genie just like the one in Aladdin and His Magic Lamp.
Aladdin's lamp.
You poor, dear, boy.
What did they do to you over there?
Tsk.
Oh, nonsense, Amanda.
As a psychiatrist, the answer is obvious: The boy is suffering from pre-adolescent delusions resulting from a comic book syndrome.
Okay, I'll open the bottle.
I'll show you.
All right, Melvin, now, what do you see?
Nothing.
It's too dark.
But I know she's in here.
I'm glad he's from your side of the family.
Jeannie?
Jeannie.
Oh, come on out, Jeannie.
All I wanna do is apologize.
Where would I go if I was a genie and I wanted to sulk?
I'd go to my bottle, 'cause that's where always Jeannie sulks.
Jeannie?
Well, she wasn't in the coffeepot.
Yeah?
Maybe she's in the pot, huh?
Ah!
It's hot.
Roger, would you, uh, look under the bar please?
I've looked under the bar.
I've looked every place.
The bottle's gone.
Oh, Major Healey?
Uh, this is Dr. Bellows.
Uh, would you, um, would you kindly tell Major Nelson that, uh, uh, Melvin sort of, uh, accidentally, uh, brought home that decorative bottle that he keeps in his living room?
Really?
Oh, hey, Tony, good news.
Dr. Bellows found the bottle.
Yeah, where?
It's at his house.
Is Jeannie in it?
Uh, Dr. Bellows, is, uh, Jeannie?
Uh, hello, uh, Col.
Bottle, this is Major Bellows.
Do you have the Nelson there?
Sorry, I Major, have you been drinking?
Uh, no, not yet.
Why don't I come over and pick it up, sir?
Oh, nonsense.
I'll, uh I'll drop it by in the morning.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I I'd just take a couple of minutes.
I can pick it up right away.
Major Nelson, after all, it's just a bottle.
Or is it?
Uh, well, it's an It's an antique, sir.
I wouldn't want you to be worried about it.
I'll I'll be right over, huh?
Major Nelson, it's getting late.
You can get it in the morning, and that's an order.
Yeah, but Col.
Bottle Bettie Bittle   Melvin, put that bottle down.
Major Nelson's coming for it in the morning.
He is?
Ouch!
Now I got ya.
What are you doing with that bottle of sherry?
Nothing.
Sherry that may explain a lot of things.
For heaven's sake.
Hm.
Come on, it's time to go to bed.
And leave the bottle of sherry there.
How about a glass of wine when you get back?
When I come back, yes.
Where am I?
What if they're not asleep yet?
There's not a light on in the house.
We gotta get Jeannie out of there.
Hold this.
Now give me the, uh, pocket knife.
Will you give me?
These weird things.
Here.
I'll wait in the car.
Stay here.
Yeah, stay here.
There.
Will you hurry up?
Shh.
What are we doing breaking in a house anyway?
Must be crazy.
Shut up.
Shut up, shut up.
Go on in.
I'm not going in.
You go in.
All right, all right.
Shut up.
Roger, Roger.
Alfred.
Alfred, I think I just heard some noises downstairs.
Call my office for an appointment.
Alfred, will you get up?
Alfred, get up.
All right, be quiet.
Shhh, shhh.
You take this side of the room and I'll take that side of the room.
That side.
Shhh.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie, are you in there?
Sh!
What are you doing?
Got him in three moves.
Go check the bar.
Shh.
Check the bar.
What are you doing now?
Here's to our first heist.
Would you cut that out?
Here she is.
Jeannie?
Hello, master.
Hiccup!
Uh, don't Don't worry, now.
You're safe, you're safe.
All right, now, take that.
Here, get out of here.
Shh.
Go on.
He got the wrong bottle.
He got the wrong bottle!
Jeannie, come on out.
Jeannie?
What's the matter?
She's not in there.
Oh, great.
So far we've stolen an empty bottle, a broken window and a pair of curtains.
Will you please get up now?
What's the matter?
What did you hear?
I heard noises.
I heard somebody come in.
Hurry up.
Oh, all right, for heaven's sake.
Would you kindly put your robe on your own bed?
We have to get something to protect ourselves with.
What have you got?
I don't know.
There's a vase No.
No.
Something big.
Something very big.
Oh, Alfred, it isn't raining for heaven's sake.
No, you should be out first.
I'm not going out first.
Don't push!
I'm not pushing.
Shh, be quiet.
Shhh, shhh.
Come on over here.
She's gotta be around the bar somewhere.
Look around the bar.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Whoo-hoo.
Oh, master.
Alfred, I know I heard something.
I know when I hear something, and I head something.
It was a sort of a crushing sound.
Didn't you hear it?
Don't you ever hear anything?
I might if you stopped talking.
Oh.
What was that?
Shh.
Great, great, there she is.
There's Dr. Bellows.
Oh!
I'll turn the light on.
No, no, no, stay close in case there is a prowler.
Oh, Amanda, what a time to get the hiccups.
Hold your breath or something.
You go jerk the plug and then jump out window.
Jump out the window, jerk the plug.
No!
What?
Jerk the plug, and then jump out the window.
I'll get Jeannie.
Shh.
Alfred, why did you turn off the light?
I never touched it.
I'm standing here holding your hand.
What?
!
Alfred!
What was that?
What did you hit?
By mistake I hit the vase.
My vase!
Why did you turn the lights out, Alfred?
I didn't touch the lights.
What?
The door.
Alfred, somebody came to the door.
Can you see it?
No.
You get the door, quietly.
Just quietly.
I'll be behind you.
I'll be right behind you.
You answer it.
Go ahead, answer it.
Okay.
Oh, Major Nelson, Major Healey.
Hello.
How are you?
Oh, what are you doing here?
Turn on the light.
Well, we were just passing by.
We thought we saw a prowler.
We'd thought we'd drop in and see how you were.
Major.
Huh?
They've been drinking, Alfred!
I know why they're here.
They came to get the bottle with the lady in it.
Melvin, will you please go back to bed.
Alfred, stop yelling at the boy.
Oh, Melvin, maybe you should go back to bed.
I don't want you around these officers in this disgusting condition.
But I trapped her in the sherry bottle.
I'll show you.
Oh, Melvin, really.
What kind of sherry was that?
Wait, wait.
Wait a minute.
I'll show you, I'll show you.
Would you go and change your clothes?
What are you talking about for heaven's sake, dear?
What in the bottle?
What was it?
Jeannie Jeannie?
Where did you come from?
Baghdad.
Baghdad?
There's something going on around here.
I told ya!
It's all because the lady in the bottle.
She's magic.
I'll prove it to you.
Now, Melvin, this had gone too far.
Let me see that bottle.
I've never heard of anything Hm, I don't see anything.
Melvin, what's the matter with you?
Oh, Amanda, look at the thing.
I don't think there's anything to laugh at.
I don't think so either, sir.
But I was sure.
I was positive.
Oh, Melvin, for heaven's sake, positive of what?
What nonsense, a lady in a bottle.
But the genie She was in there!
You know, from now on Stop talking.
It's your fault, Amanda.
If you'd pay more attention  Hey, will you come on?
We're gonna be late.
I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying.
Dr. Bellows wants us in his office by 8:00.
I don't want to upset him after last night.
Have another cup of coffee.
I never had my first cup.
Hey, look, we've only got five minutes now.
Come on.
Listen, Jeannie can blink us down there in a minute.
What's the big rush, huh?
Oh, boy, you've taken your time.
I can't believe you.
I still don't understand what's the rush.
What do you mean, what's the rush?
Good morning, Jeannie.
Ooh.
What is good about it?
How are you feeling, darling?
That bad, huh?
Mmm.
You think you can blink us to NASA?
Yes, master.
Okay.
Uncle Alfred, you promised to take me to the zoo.

They're here!
The lady's here!
Oh, for heaven's sakes, Melvin!
Don't you believe me?
Look at 'em!
Look at 'em!
Jeannie, I'm going into my office.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Master.
A-are you sure I look all right?
Of course.
You look wonderful.
Now, will you stop worrying.
Well, what if they do not like me?
What if I say something wrong?
Darling, it's, um, the The Officers' Wives Association, not the Spanish Inquisition.
Now, all you have to do is smile.
Be polite.
Uh, talk about ordinary, everyday things.
And, in short, just Just be yourself.
Be myself.
Be Right.
Yes, darling.
Be myself.
What am I saying?
Uh, Jeannie.
You wouldn't want to completely be yourself.
I mean, you couldn't do that, could you?
Ooh!
Now Now Now, look.

See you later.
Nice seeing you, Mrs. Bellows.
Now, you see, she loves what you were wearing.
Eh There's nothing to worry about, Jeannie.
But I mean, if there was, I would be nervous, wouldn't I?
And I'm not.
I'm cool, nonchalant, um Uh, I don't have a care in the world.
And you shouldn't have a care in the world either.
You are right, darling.
I am being so silly.
Yeah.
Goodbye.
Bye.
I'm not nervous!
I'm not nervous.
No, of course.
It is exactly the same outfit.
Oh, dear.
Ah, yes.
Hm, hm.
That is better.
Well, I I'm afraid I'm a little nervous, sir.
It's Jeannie's first meeting at the Officers' Wives Association.
I don't see why that should worry you.
I'm sure she'll do fine.
Why, hello, Jeannie.
Beautiful.
Oh, thank you.
Pink's your color.
Jeannie, what's with the dress?
Why did you change?
Oh, well, I could not help it, master.
Another woman had on exactly the same thing.
Yeah Well, she would hate me.
Darling Hate me.

Go!
Go.
I beg your pardon.
I was telling Jeannie to go, sir.
She's gonna be late for an appointment.
A meeting.
You were saying?
Oh, yes.
The, uh Uh, simulator schedule for the XT-4.
It's been changed.
Yes?
Uh, you and Major Healey are gonna be in it instead of, uh, Captain Billings and Commander Lawrence.
Oh, good, sir.
We'll be looking forward to it.
Major, I'm going this way.
Well, why don't you go this way?
You seen Jeannie's dress?
Boy, blue's her color.
Uh, Major Healy, would you mind?
Blue?
I will now accept nominations for the office of recording secretary.
Oh.
Well, I wanna nominate Jeannie Nelson, Major Nelson's wife and our newest member.
Oh, no.
No, please.
Uh, Mrs. Bellows, I am not qualified.
I second the nomination.
It's very simple, darling.
It's nothing to it.
Uh, yes, and I move the nominations be closed.
It's been moved and seconded that nominations for the office of recording secretary are closed.
All in favor?
Aye.
Congratulations, Jeannie.
You're our new recording secretary.
You can start now.
Uh Mrs. Bellows.
Hm?
What does a recording secretary do?
Oh, it's very simple, Jeannie.
You just, uh, take the minutes.
Oh.
Heh.
But I do not even have a watch.
Here, I'll show you.
Take this book.
And then you open to the date of the meeting, you see?
And My suit!
Good heavens.
Uh, Mrs. Nelson, I know this is going to sound silly, but what am I wearing?
A pink dress.
Is, uh?
Is something the matter?
Yes.
I don't own a pink dress.
Oh.
Pink or blue.
I mean, what's the difference?
I mean, anyway, what do you want from me?
How did I know she was gonna blink another dress?
How did I know?
All right, Roger.
Forget it.
She was inside before Dr. Bellows could make anything out of it anyhow.
You know what Dr. Bellows is gonna have me do?
What?
Take a bunch of tests for colorblindness.
Yeah.
So there it is, ladies.
A decision from the National Wives' Association.
In recognition of the special demands placed upon our men by the military, the first annual Good Husband Award.
Hm.
That's a good idea.
Now, you are all on your honor as officers' wives to keep this contest absolutely secret.
Oh, well, of co Absolutely se  Uh, during the week, a panel, uh, selected by me, uh, will investigate and interview each husband and wife thoroughly.
The officer who is most helpful around the house, most sympathetic, most understanding, will win two weeks in Hawaii.
Oh!
With his wife, of course.
All expenses paid.
Oh.
That's marvelous.
Marvelous.
Sympathetic and understanding.
Oh.
Anthony will win easily.
Hm.
He has so much to be understanding about.
Jeannie.
Darling, I'm home.
Aloha, master.
Oh.
I bought you a present.
Do you like it?
Mm.
Oh.
Yes, that's great.
Is a Hawaiian lei the new style for Cocoa Beach this season?
No, no.
But you never know when it might come in handy.
Uh, darling, something came up at the office I have to talk to you about.
Oh, nice.
Come into the living room and And sit down and talk to me, my darling, kind, sympathetic and understanding husband.
Well, I'm afraid you're gonna have to be the one to understand, sweetheart.
Oh.
We shall both understand each other.
I'm gonna be away all week.
I do not understand.
There's been a change in the In the simulator schedule.
Uh, Roger and I are gonna be working on the XT-4, and we start tomorrow.
Oh, master, not this week.
Why?
Is there something special about this week?
Oh, no.
No, no.
No, nothing special.
Are you, uh, telling me everything?
What happened at the Officers' Wives Association meeting?
Oh, well, they They voted me recording secretary, and  You're kidding.
Hey, uh, Jeannie, that's wonderful.
That's never happened to you before.
You're a success.
Oh, my darling Anthony, you are so kind and understanding.
Mm-hm.
And it is all wasted on me.
Yeah.
Right.
Uh, it's time, colonel.
Oh, uh, thanks, Art.
XT-4, XT-4.
Uh, this is Dr. Bellows.
Do you read?
Loud and clear, Dr. Bellows.
Good day's work, gentlemen.
It's time to take your pills and go to sleep.
Uh, Dr. Bellows, I know you're I know you're duplicating mission conditions exactly, but do you think, uh, instead of these pills, we can de?
Out of the question, Major Healey.
You're sealed in there until simulated, uh, splashdown at, uh, one week from today.
Sorry.
Uh, Dr. Bellows, about those pills, sir.
The last time we took them, they didn't work too well.
Well, you needn't worry about that.
They've been strengthened.
Once you take them, there's nothing in the world that can wake you up for eight hours.
Uh, Dr. Bellows.
Uh, are you going to monitor our dreams?
Well, of course.
Don't pay any attention to mine.
They have nothing to do with our mission.
Heh.
Well here goes.
Mm.
Mrs. Nelson.
Oh.
We are sorry to surprise you, but, uh, we are dropping in on all our good-husband candidates this way.
Well.
Y-y Yes.
This is a surprise.
Well, Mrs. Endicott doesn't want to catch husbands on good behavior.
Uh, may we come in?
Oh, well.
Yes, of course.
Come in.
Oh, isn't this pretty.
Oh, Jeannie, may we see Major Nelson?
We'll We all just came in for a few minutes.
Well Well, he He is not here right now.
Really?
At 8:00 in the evening?
Well, perhaps it's a bad time.
We'll come back, uh, tomorrow night.
Oh.
He will not be here tomorrow night either.
Oh.
Well, you poor girl.
Well that seems to let Major Nelson out.
Oh, w-well, you do not understand.
You see, he is on a Aren't you being a little harsh?
Perhaps Major Nelson had to work late.
Then he should get a good-officer award.
We're here to consider him for a good husband which he clearly is not.
Uh, you have my sympathy, my dear.
I'm sorry, Jeannie.
Well, that is not fair.
Anthony is too a good husband.
Wait!
Um If, uh If you still wish to see Anthony, uh, you may see him now.
But Jeannie, you said he wasn't here.
Oh, well.
He He is not here.
He, uh He is in the, uh kitchen.
Yes, of course.
Oh.
Some kind of evening.
Uh, if, uh If If If you will all just wait one moment, I will bring him out to you.
Hm.
Heh.
Master.
I am sorry about this, but  Anthony?
Anthony, what is the matter?
Anthony, wake up.
Wake up.
Oh, dear.
Oh, dear.
My blink does not even wake him up.
Uh, don't make him come out, Mrs. Nelson.
We'll come in there.
Oh!
Uh, n-no.
You must excuse the intrusion, Major Nelson, but Uh, M-M-Ma Major Nelson?
He's asleep.
Mm-hm.
Yes, he is.
I don't understand.
Asleep over the dishes?
Well, yes.
Y-you see, when he came home this evening, he was so tired, that I suggested that he have his dinner and go right to bed.
But he is so kind and considerate, heh, that he insisted on doing the dishes.
Poor dear.
Extraordinary.
Well, that is indeed a good husband.
Oh, yes.
He is quite wonderful.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Nelson.
We'll, uh, come back tomorrow night, when your husband is not so tired.
Oh, well, he will probably be tired tomorrow night too.
Heh.
As a matter of fact, I I think he will be tired, oh, the rest of the week.
Well sorry to hear that.
A good husband is not only helpful and considerate, he is also alert and attentive.
Good night.
Good night, Jeannie.
Good night, Jeannie.
Alert and attentive.
Oh, dear.
That will be more difficult.
Oh.
Oh, husband, darling.
You were wonderful.
Mwah.
Hm.
Good morning, Art.
Are they up yet?
Good morning, colonel.
Just about to wake them, sir.
XT-4, this is CAPCOM.
Do you read?
XT-4, this is CAPCOM.
Do you read?
Yeah, I read you loud and clear, CAPCOM.
Where?
Where are we?
We have you over Bermuda, having just completed 12th orbit.
All systems are still go.
Where'd you get the apron?
I I wasn't issued an apron.
Hm?
The apron.
XT-4.
Good morning, gentlemen.
This is Dr. Bellows.
What did Major Healey say about an apron?
Apron?
Uh, no, sir.
He said we were bearing on Cape One.
How do you both feel after your sleep?
Yeah, fine, sir.
Except the, uh Uh, fine, fine.
Uh, except we seem to have, uh chapped hands.
Chapped hands?
That'll be a new one on the biomedical section.
Yes.
Hm.
Yes.
Ah, yes.
Heh.
Darling?
Da?
Oh.
Oh!
Oh.
Darling, uh Oh, not again.
Oh, darling, please wake up.
Please.
Wake up.
They will be here any minute, and you must be alert and attentive.
Please.
Oh!
Oh.
Perhaps we can compromise.
Yes.
Uh.
Uh-huh.
Well, perhaps they will not notice you were asleep.
Oh, darling master.
I am sorry to do this to you, but after all, you are the best husband at NASA, and you deserve to win the prize.
Oh.
Well  Here we go.
Yes.
Come in, please.
The door is open.
Well, good evening.
Hi, Jeannie.
Gee, I do hope your husband's feeling better tonight.
Oh, yes.
Anthony is feeling much better.
Are you not, darling?
Thank you for your concern, darling.
I am feeling in the pink.
Would you ladies like to sit down and make yourselves comfortable?
Oh, thank you.
Uh, we, uh We just want to ask you a few questions.
Uh, for a report that the National Wives' Association is preparing.
Oh, well, A-Anthony is just helping me twine some yarn.
He is so helpful with little tasks around the house.
Would you like some coffee?
Well, only if you have it made.
Oh, yes.
Anthony made it himself.
He is so helpful.
Uh Uh, darling, would you please?
Yes!
Heh.
Oh.
Take this.
I didn't think there were husbands like that left in the world.
I Oh, well, Anthony is something special.
Please try the cookies.
I baked them myself.
That is going too far.
Uh, Major Nelson, however do you find the time for  All of this?
Excuse me.
I forgot something.
Coffee Is your husband  Uh, always so, uh, stiff and formal?
I mean, uh, boys will be boys, but I think a good husband should be uh, gentle and intimate.
Gentle?
Intimate?
Here you are, gorgeous.
Because you're so beautiful.
What?
Huh.
Oh, I I am ve I am so sorry.
I thought you were Jeannie.
I mean, he thought He thought you were me.
What is going on around here?
Oh, you You must excuse Anthony.
I sometimes do these mad, impulsive things just to brighten an otherwise dull evening.
Well, now, everybody be calm.
Everybody be calm.
Uh Uh Uh, we have to get back to the questions.
Oh, yes.
Jeannie, I-I I think Mrs. Endicott would like to ask Tony some questions in private.
Um, why don't we all go into the kitchen.
Private?
No.
No, no, no.
I do not think that is a good idea.
No.
Yes, let's go in the kitchen.
No.
I-I really do not think it  Oh, no.
That's a marvelous idea.
I want   XT-4.
XT-4.
This is Dr. Bellows.
CAPCOM, this is XT-4.
Retros on.
And firing.
I just want to congratulate you men on a very successful mission.
Thank you, sir.
Thank you, sir.
Except for some unexplained blackouts on Major Nelson's dream-monitoring device on Monday and Wednesday, the mission was flawless.
We're glad you're pleased, sir.
The bird handles like a dream.
Oh, by the way.
We won't hold you for debriefing today.
After splashdown, you'll be home in an hour.
Yeah.
But not to my home.
An hour.
That's great, sir.
He won hands down.
Nobody else was even close.
You're gonna love Hawaii.
Uh, where is the major?
I think we ought to congratulate him in person.
Well, a-a-a-as a matter of fact, he, uh He does spend Saturdays with you, doesn't he?
Oh, yes, of course.
Of course he did.
Uh Uh, ladies.
Why do you not go into the living room and make yourselves comfortable.
Oh, thank you, Jeannie.
I shall, uh call Anthony.
Yes.
Oh, he will not mind one more time.
I hope.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
Well, that does it.
Tony?
Oh, Tony, come on.
You You can't leave now.
We're almost through.
Tony.
What am I doing here?
I'm supposed to be in that simulator.
I have wonderful news.
Shh!
Be quiet.
You are going to spend two weeks in Hawaii.
If you don't get me back in that simulator, I'm gonna spend two years in Leavenworth.
Now Oh, Mrs. Bellows.
How nice to see you.
Well Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, please, do Do come in.
We We were just waiting for Anthony.
Oh, well, you're gonna have a long wait.
I just spoke to Alfred, and he's still in the simulator.
As a matter of fact, he's been in the simulator all week.
I don't know how he could possibly have been interviewed.
Oh, well, I'll just go hang up my coat.
Oh, no.
No, no, no.
Why do you not keep it.
I-I believe it is a little chilly in here.
Chilly?
Oh, it is.
Oh, well.
Well, fine.
Love that suit on you.
Oh, just lovely.
I want to know who bought it.
Are we not lucky Mrs. Bellows is able to come.
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
Mrs. Nelson?
Ha-ha.
Hi.
I did the ironing and the washing, and I finished upstairs, and I want to talk to you about my check.
Get me out of here.
Get me out of here.
Now, please.
Heh.
Congratulations, Major Healey.
It was a marvelous mission.
Well, uh everything was fine until the end, sir.
But, uh well, there's something I gotta tell you, sir.
You see, Tony He's wearing a Uh, Major Nelson, congrat Tony.
Major Nelson.
What?
Now, Major Nelson, don't try to deny that you came out of the XT-4 wearing a woman's coat and high-heeled shoes, because I saw you.
Besides, the evidence is right there.
I'm not trying to deny it, sir.
I'm simply trying to explain it.
Well, that's exactly what I am waiting for.
He's waiting, Tony.
Thanks, Roge.
Oh!
There you are, you adorable man.
Oh.
Where did all these women come from?
Madam, would you mind explaining to me just exactly who you are?
I am Mrs. Admiral Endicott.
And I am here to present Major Nelson the first annual Good Husband Award.
Oh!
Is it not wonderful, husband?
Mm.
I don't know how you had time to interview him.
He's been in a simulator all week.
Oh!
I'll be interested in that myself.
Huh?
Simulator?
Why, that's ridiculous.
We spent two delightful evenings together.
That's absolutely right.
We were there too.
I've never seen ladies in my life, sir.
I told you.
How could he ever be?
Ladies, please come out here a minute.
This all Wait a minute.
The apron.
The dream machine.
Mm-hm.
It's all beginning to make hideous sense to me.
Oh.
Are you not pleased, husband, darling?
Huh?
And the prize is two weeks in Hawaii.
Mwah.
Two we?
Major Nelson.
Excuse me, Jeannie.
In Hawaii?
Some of these women insist that you were at your house last Monday and Tuesday night.
Now, what do you say to that?
What do I say to that?
I'll tell you what I say to that, sir.
Dr. Bellows.
How would you like a two-weeks' vacation in Hawaii, all expenses paid.
Pardon?
They're confused.
They gave me the prize, but I don't deserve it.
I want you and Mrs. Bellows to have the prize.
Out of the question.
You won the prize.
I selected you.
Well, in that case, I can do anything I want to with it.
I'll tell you the other stuff later.
Well, it certainly is, major.
It certainly is.
It is very generous of you.
I don't know.
Jeannie.
Blink out those women's clothes.
All of 'em?
Oh.
All of 'em.
All the women's clothes right now.
Oh, Amanda, I agree      How did you?
Oh.
What's the matter with you, darling?
You said Quick, kiss me.
Hm?
Mm.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Hi, Roge.
The general's not in his office and he doesn't respond to the page.
Maybe he's testing out the new wind tunnel.
You can't hear a thing in there.
Four hundred and eighty-six.
Fourteen more balls, and for the first time in 25 years, I win.
You haven't beaten me yet, you old windbag.
Oh?
Let the master here  Ah.
Yeah.
The general's in the recreation hall.
I'm just going there now.
It'll be a good time to ask him.
He'll be relaxing.
Drat.
Too bad, Chuck, you were never any good under pressure.
What did you want to ask General Schaeffer?
I promised Jeannie I'd take her to Bermuda, and I was hoping the general would give me the week off.
There shouldn't be any problem.
Yeah.
Well, one more after this, and it's game, set and match to me.
Well, this is it, Charlie.
Well, master, did you ask him yet?
Hm?
Oh, you gotta be Oh!
Your ball, sir.
I'm sorry, sir.
If there's any way I could make it up to you, I'd certainly try There is no way, major.
No way in the world.
This just wasn't any pool game.
If I had beaten Fitzhugh, I'd be eligible for the National All-Military Tournament.
The dream of my life.
But no.
You had to yell.
Why, major?
Why?
Uh, well, I-I really don't think this is the moment for it, sir.
This isn't the moment?
Major, 10 minutes ago in the recreation hall, that wasn't the moment!
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
Now, get it off your chest!
I'm gonna be busy the rest of the day moping.
Well, sir, uh, I was wondering if you You could see your way clear to giving me the rest of the week off.
Request denied.
I thought that's what you'd say.
Anything else?
No, no, that's about all.
Unless, of course, if I could ask you again when you're perhaps in a better mood, sir.
Just because I shot pool with Charlie Fitzhugh for 25 years and you made me lose the only chance I ever had of beating him, you don't think I'd let that influence my judgment, do you?
No, sir.
You've always been a very fair man.
Good.
I'm very glad to hear that.
It's very important to me, very important.
Request denied!
Oh, excuse me, sir.
For heaven's sakes, major, what made you yell like that?
Well, master, did he say yes?
Did he say yes?
Hm, hm, hm?
Just when the general was about to  Oh!
Oh, excuse me.
I'll put the question another way: What is the matter with you?
One of those cleaning tags, sir, with the little points on it.
It's sticking into me here.
Then why don't you take it out?
Or do you intend to go about the base shrieking all day?
Oh, no, I'm gonna take it out, sir.
Get out.
Uh, if you'll excuse me, sir.
Yes.
Darling.
Oh, where did you come from, Jeannie?
You startled me.
She has a habit of doing that, sir.
Oh, I'm sorry, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, that's all right.
Nice seeing you, Jeannie.
Excuse me.
Yes.
Bye.
Well, darling, did the general say yes?
Hm?
Uh, not in so many words.
No.
Oh, Anthony, why do you not wait until he is in a better mood and then ask him again?
Hm?
Well, I'm afraid if I waited that long, we'd both be too old to go to Bermuda.
To be absolutely fair, sir, if I hadn't startled General Schaeffer when he was making his last shot, he would have won, wouldn't he?
Heh-heh.
That's his tough luck.
Here.
Care to take a cue?
Oh, no, I don't play at all.
Come on, it's good for your concentration.
No, I really don't play very well at all.
The eight ball in the side pocket.
Right over there.
All right.
See what I mean about concentration?
You can do anything you want to try to foul me up.
Laugh.
Jump up and down.
Scream.
Holler.
It doesn't mean a thing.
See what I mean?
Over here.
Yeah, that's great.
If you'd just reconsider.
You and General Schaeffer have been friends for years.
That's right.
We go back to '44.
It was his squadron against my squadron.
Now it's NASA Houston against NASA Cocoa Beach.
NASA Houston, winner and still champion.
Heh.
Well, I sure wish you'd change your mind, sir.
Major Nelson, did, uh, General Schaeffer send you here?
No, sir.
He doesn't know I'm here.
I have to leave for Houston at 6:00 in the morning.
If he wants to play tonight, I'll give him another chance.
No holds barred.
Really?
You mean it?
Yeah, 200 balls.
Oh, really, sir?
I'll tell him.
I'm sorry.
Here.
I'm awfully sorry.
Tonight I'll murder him.
Ha-ha.
I'll really destroy him.
I I'm sure I I don't take charity from Chuck Fitzhugh.
Oh, sir, it's not charity.
General Fitzhugh just realized that he won by a fluke, that's all.
Well, it isn't just me, it's It's the honor of the base, huh?
That's right, sir.
Now, you wouldn't want me to let, uh, Chuck go back to Houston and say that NASA Cocoa Beach couldn't shoot pool.
No, sir.
Couldn't let that happen.
And there's a cup involved, a beer stein from our 8th Air Force days.
No, I want that cup for our own display case.
We're all counting on you to get it back for us, sir.
I'll do it.
You tell General Fitzhugh to meet me at the rec hall at 8:00.
Right, sir.
No, no, no, no.
I'll tell him.
All right.
Oh, and, uh, by the way, Major Nelson Yes, sir?
About your leave?
Mm-hm?
I'm reconsidering it.
Thank you.
Oh, you wait here.
Yes, sir.
Did you ask him again?
Would you please get outta here?
By the way, thank you.
Ah!
Yes, sir.
No!
I am sorry, master, but I was so excited about going to Bermuda that I-I could not wait to hear.
Yeah, well, you might as well forget about Bermuda.
The way General Schaeffer feels, I'll be lucky if he lets me have the night off to go to the movies.
How is his hand?
I don't know.
He wouldn't let me go with him to see Dr. Bellows.
Oh, hi, everybody.
Oh, hi, Roge.
I thought I'd come over and cheer you up.
How's General Schaeffer?
Well, he's all right, but just don't come near me.
What's the matter?
If you're the jinx he says, I don't want you to touch me, that's all.
My master is not a jinx.
It is I who caused the trouble.
I always cause problems.
Well, with you I'll take the chance.
How about Schaeffer's hand?
What's the matter?
His hand?
He broke it, that's what's wrong.
He's not gonna be able to play pool in six weeks.
Oh, boy, I feel terrible about that.
Think of it this way: With a broken hand, he won't be able to break your neck.
Oh, I have a fantastically brilliant idea.
I'm all ears.
Suppose you take General Schaeffer's place, and I would help you to win, then Schaeffer will get his cup and we will go to Bermuda.
Forget it.
Hello, Jeannie, Major Nelson, Major Healey.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
I, um I just left General Schaeffer.
He's about to That poor man.
I do not blame him for not letting us go to Bermuda.
Oh, uh, I'm afraid there's more.
The orbiting laboratory we're planning to launch, where the astronauts plan to live for, uh, six months Six months?
Now, for that I would blame him.
No, you misunderstand.
He doesn't want Major Nelson to go on the orbiting laboratory.
He wants him to monitor from the North Pole tracking station.
Well, that is much too harsh a punishment.
Yeah, well, Tony, I hope you enjoy your new partner.
The general doesn't see it as a punishment.
He just feels that, uh, uh, NASA should be protected from Major Nelson for a while.
Yeah, well, don't worry about a thing, Tony.
I'll write.
No, there's no need to write.
You're gonna be there too.
Heh.
I'll be right there.
Oh, well, uh, on the other hand, I-I have a better idea.
Tony plays great.
Great Great pool player.
He could take General Schaeffer's place.
Roger, that's ridiculous.
I haven't played pool in years.
I wouldn't know what to do.
Oh, darling, do not be so modest.
You know you were a regular pool trout.
A trout?
That's a pool shark.
She's always kidding.
I-I will show you.
This way, darling.
Come on.
Go on, Anthony.
Show Dr. Bellows how good you are, darling.
Oh, I don't know anything about this.
Uh, Dr. Bellows, I don't know the first thing about Come on, major, with your own pool table in your house?
Pick up a stick.
A stick?
We don't have any sticks.
I don't think we have any.
The pool cues.
The pool cues.
Oh.
Major Where did that come from?
Uh, where'd they come from?
Oh, well, they Jeannie, Jeannie, Jeannie Oh, here you are, major.
Oh, thank you, sir.
I-I Heh.
I'm, uh, really a-a rank amateur.
I really don't know a lot about this.
Well, try.
Just try.
Yes, try.
Yeah, try.
Uh, all right.
The, uh, eight ball in the side pocket.
Eight ball in the side pocket.
Eight ball in the side pocket.
Right.
Not that side pocket.
Not that side pocket!
The table side pocket!
Major, what are you yelling at Jeannie for?
It was Major Nelson who made the mistake.
Yeah, but you Oh, well, uh Yeah, well, I'm a little edgy, sir.
That's I'm sorry, Jeannie.
I think we better forget the whole thing.
Good idea, sir.
If General Schaeffer was beaten, you'd be humiliated.
Sir, I'd like to help, but I just don't think I'm qualified.
Oh, wait.
Wait a minute.
That was his first shot.
Anybody can make a mistake.
Anybody can make a mistake on his first shot.
Yeah.
Thanks, both of you.
I-I needed that.
Just try, okay?
Try.
Try again.
All right, uh Uh, in the In the corner pocket.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Not only will he make that one, but he'll do the nine ball, the seven ball, uh, the six ball and the five ball.
Nine, seven, six and five ball.
I don't have a chance of making the nine, the seven, the six.
I-I could maybe make the one, two, six and 10.
Yeah, I could.
Do the six and the 15.
The nine, eight Nine, seven, six.
Oh, now, I could maybe make the one, two, six Two, six, 15.
It's the nine ball, eight Nine ball, seven, six Nine, seven, six, five  Please, major, will you try?
Shoot anything.
All right, sir.
Extraordinary.
Absolutely extraordinary.
I'll go get the general.
Huh?
Uh, sir, wait a minute.
Wait!
Major Nelson shoot for General Schaeffer?
I could beat him blindfolded.
I'll take that bet.
Uh, please, Major Healey.
After all, general, the terms of your bet with General Schaeffer were that the best pool player at NASA Houston would play the best pool player at NASA Cocoa Beach.
Now, if Major Nelson wants to play for General Schaeffer, I can't see what difference it makes.
Colonel, I came here to defend this cup, not to give pool lessons.
All right, bring on your Major Nelson.
Good.
I'll go get him.
Oh, uh, general.
Yeah?
Sir, uh, how would you like to make this interesting?
It is interesting.
Uh, well, I mean I mean, how would you like to make a little wager, huh?
Let's say my month's salary against your month's salary?
Those are some odds.
You're only a major and I'm a general.
Well, then how about your month's salary against my month's salary?
I have a feeling that you're trying to hustle me.
Okay, you're on.
Oh, sorry.
I'm sorry, sir.
You'd, uh, better look at it while you have a chance.
After this match it goes back to Houston.
We'll see.
Women at a pool match?
Oh, uh, Jeannie.
Why, thank you.
Oh, uh, excuse me, uh, general, this is, uh, Major Nelson's wife.
Jeannie, this is General Fitzhugh.
How do you do?
How do you do, Mrs. Nelson?
No offense, but, uh, pool is a man's game.
Oh, I am not going to play.
I came here to watch.
Now, look, if she stays, the match is off.
Call it superstition if you like, but women and pool don't mix.
Oh, Jeannie, I'm awfully sorry, but I'm afraid Jeannie, why don't you wait in my office?
There's magazines No, I must stay.
Coffee in the machine.
Anthony!
Goodbye, Sunshine.
Hello, Frostbite.
What?
Wait a minute, wait.
She can't go!
Huh?
I mean, she can't go.
All right, let's get this show on the road!
Come on.
She can't go.
About that bet, sir What's the matter?
Cold feet?
Yeah, cold feet, cold nose, cold everything.
I'll give you the advantage.
I'll break.
Well What is that, a bridge?
Give me a cue there, will you?
I'll give it to you, sir.
All right.
Call the game off.
Here you are, sir.
I'm sorry.
Oh, dear, how can I blink if I do not know what I am blinking?
Your shot, major.
Sir, there's no shot.
I I couldn't possibly get a ball in the hole.
That's the name of the game.
No shot.
Your shot, major.
Thirty-seven to nothing.
Do you think we have a chance, sir?
Of course, if Nelson's as good as you say he is.
You can shoot.
Yes, sir.
Just, uh Roger, could I have some talcum, please?
I'm just trying to line up the shots.
Oops.
There.
A problem with the top.
Hey, hey, hey.
Tsk.
Oh Tsk.
It is no good.
They would see me.
I know.
The, uh, seven ball in the corner pocket, sir.
Would you excuse me, sir?
Move back a little.
The seven ball and six others.
That's incredible.
I told you, sir.
Did I do that?
Oh, money, money, money.
Oh, a general.
Two-star general.
One month's salary.
Whew.
Rich.

How much does a general make?
He's a hustler's hustler.
Ha-ha!
How much does a general make, sir?
Shh!
Shh.
He missed.
He missed.
It's right under there.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
Don't worry.
Three more balls and we've won.
Fitzhugh can't possibly catch us.
Oh, no.
I saw it go under there.
To the left.
Jeannie, what are you doing?
Get out.

I don't know.
What in?
Watch it!
Yes, major!
Oh, I'm sorry, sir,.
Major Nelson, where is the ball?
Jeannie, please, wake up.
Jeannie.
Major!
Wake up and get outta here.

Would you blink outta here?
I don't care.
Anywhere.
Yes, master.
Major?
Coming.
Oh.
Where'd you go?
Come on, let's get on with it!
Ah, yes, sir.
Your shot, sir.
Sorry, sir.
Would you like talcum?
Never mind.
Please.
I had better let the general catch up a little, just to make it close.
Ah, gentlemen.
Yeah.
He's playing way over his head.
One ninety-nine.
One more ball and we're through.
Oh, ah, ah, ah, ah.
That is close enough, general.
Sorry, gentlemen, this is it.
Ha-ha!
Like shooting fish in a barrel.

You never were any good under pressure.
Oh, come to papa, little cup.
Where's the cup?

Where you been?
Bye, master.
I think my master should meet his high school sweetheart today.
But there is no sense taking chances.
Oh, that's perfectly all right, major.
I understand.
I hope that Jeannie's mother feels better.
Oh, I'm sure it's nothing serious, sir.
Excuse me, miss.
May I help you find someone?
Oh, that is all right.
I Um, that is, yes.
I am looking for Major Nelson's office.
I'm sorry, but you'll have to get a pass.
If you'll go around the corner Oh, I have a pass.
I forgot to put it on.
See?
I see.
Yes.
So Jeannie didn't go to her mother's after all.
Major Nelson's office, was it?
Right around the corner, first door on your left.
Uh, thank you.
You're welcome.
She's jealous of my high school sweetheart.
Well, I better teach that young lady a lesson.
Oh, uh, major, just one more question about the telemetry report.
Yes.
All right, sir.
Now, about that, uh, telemetry report, I  Miss?
Whoa, miss.
Stop.
Stop.
Oh, dear.
Wait a minute.
Bonnie Crenshaw?
Yes.
But how did you know my name?
Well, I'm a psychic.
Really?
Nobody's home at his house.
Maybe I should go down to NASA with you and surprise him.
Hey, hey, that's a great idea.
While I'm talking to the procurement officer about the contracts, you can be buttering up old Bunky.
Who knows?
Maybe he can put in a good word for us.
Are you sure you don't mind my seeing him again, Moose?
I mean, uh, Bunky and I were a pretty hot item before you snatched me away from him.
Heh.
Bunky Nelson?
That twerp.
He couldn't even make first-string varsity.
But, Moose, he's a famous astronaut now.
And I'm a famous electrical supply contractor.
Hey, you trying to make me jealous?
Listen, honey, if I ever catch anybody making a pass at you, I'll break him in half.
But Bunky Nelson?
Come on.
Okay, Moose.
I just wanted to be sure.
I saw your picture in Tony's yearbook.
You were pretty then, but you're prettier now.
Oh, thank you.
Well, I was just Oh, oh, look.
I wouldn't go in there.
He's not there.
He's, uh I know, he's my best friend.
I have some pictures of him in my office.
Would you like to go over to, uh?
We can talk about him in my office.
I don't think I Honey, anybody Anybody who helps me get those contracts is okay by me.
You know something, Moose?
Mm?
Sometimes I think your precious contracts are more important to you than I am.
You, uh, like the fur coats those contracts let me get you?
Right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, if they let me make the toggle switches for their rockets, I'll buy you sable instead of dyed rabbit.
Push, pull, on, off.
They must need a million of 'em.
So you see So you see, Tony's a happily married man, to a wonderful girl.
She, uh She sounds a lot like you.
The same voice.
Really?
Really.
Is she, uh, prettier than I am?
Uh, is she prettier than you are?
Well, let's put it this way.
She's a married pretty and, uh, you're a single pretty.
You, uh You are single, aren't you?
Uh Uh, yes.
After Bunky, there was no one I could You poor kid, pining away all those years in Flower's Corners.

Moose Murphy and I. Well, you remember.
The all-city fullback.
Heh.
We got married, you know.
What?
Oh, you didn't know.
That's strange.
I didn't think it'd hurt this much.
Oh, Bunky, come on now.
Not after all these years.
Hee-hee.
Major Healey, I think that I would like to see Bunky now.
W-w-wait a minute.
You just sit down and talk.
Sit down for a drink and we can have a few sandwiches here.
We could talk.
We have so much in common.
What do we have in common, Major Healey?
What do we have in common?
What do we have in common?
Oh, well, what do we have in common?
Well, to begin with, neither one of us are married.
We're just here to sit here and talk about old Bunky.
Oh, Bunky, I had no idea.
Yes, after all these years, finally in my arms again.
Bunky, now wait.
You've got the wrong idea.
Bunky Darling, y-you'd better go home before somebody sees you.
What?
Ye Uh, don't you understand?
I recognized you from the first moment.
Yes, that's what you said.
Yeah.
S-sweetheart, I-I suppose I should be angry at you, uh, but I guess it's normal for a wife to be jealous of her husband's childhood sweetheart.
But I want you to understand Ooh!
I want you to understand that you're my wife, I love you.
There's never been anybody else.
Do you understand?
Bunky, tell me something.

Right now all I want to do is see my Is see good old Bunky.
Yeah, well, we can see good old Bunky later.
We'll go to lunch and talk about him.
Oh, Major Healey.
You are making a mistake.
I'm making a mistake?
I'm making a mistake?
He's a happily married man.
You wanna be a home wrecker?
We'll go over to my apartment and you can wreck it.
Major Healey let go of my hand.
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.
Wait, I'll never forgive myself if I let you go.
Hit him low and hit him hard.
Uh, fella, no running in the halls.
Ah, wait a minute!
So this is what I get for trusting you.
I find you billing and cooing with the first astronaut who comes along.
Okay, let's go.
We're getting out of here.
The heck with the toggle switches.
Major Healey, what are you doing on the floor?
What are you doing?
What happened?
Wake up.
Wake up, major.
What happened?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I was talking to this girl and I knew it.
I knew that one of these days one of your girls would get you into trouble.
It must be one of those days, 'cause one of those girls got me into trouble.
Yes, well, here we go, now.
Take it easy.
Oh, my head.
Oh, come, come, come, come, come.
And for heaven's sakes, major, stay out of these corridors.
Bunky, stop it.
Let me go.
What are you doing?
Jeannie, will you cut it out and blink us home?
Jeannie?
Who's Jeannie?
And what do you mean, blink?
You're weird.
What?
Help!
Shh!
How long are you gonna keep this up anyhow?
Major Nelson, what are you doing?
It's all right, sir.
She needs a little air.
Well, I shouldn't wonder.
That's funny.
I thought I saw that other fellow carry her off.
Oh where am I?
Ah!
Oh, dear, I remember.
We're going right back to Fowler's Corners.
Bonnie.
Bonnie, where are you?
She's gone back to find him.
He must have her hypnotized.
Well, we'll just see about that.
When I find that guy, the space program's gonna be short one astronaut.
Hey, have you seen my wife?
I beg your pardon?
My wife.
I'm looking for my wife and that astronaut who made a pass at her.
Oh, so that's how it was.
Yeah.
Well, you needn't worry.
She's in good hands now.
Major Nelson took her home.
Bunky Nelson?
The other guy was a blind.
Oh, Moose, you idiot.
Bunky?
Where have I heard that name before?
Major Healey.
Major, are you going to make a habit of this?
Ooh, I am beginning to wonder if this was such a good idea after all.
Jeannie, how long you gonna keep this up?
Come on.
What are you going to do?
I'm gonna ask you to sit down here and calm down while I explain the whole thing over to you again.
The masquerade is finished.
It's over.
I love you, Jeannie.
And I don't plan on loving anybody else for the rest of my life.
Oh, I take it back.
I think it is a marvelous idea.
You understand?
No.
I do.
You stay here.
Whatever it is, I'll handle it.
Yes?
Where is she?
!
Huh?
Where is she?
Oh!

Time for a shower.
You understand?
I never wanna see a Bonnie Crenshaw again, you understand?

Ha-ha.
I'm telling you, there wasn't anything I could do.
But  Hi, Tony.
How about a little lunch, huh?
Oh, I can't.
What's the matter?
Well, I just had to cancel a luncheon engagement with Jeannie because some Lieutenant Dawson is coming in from Houston.
I have to have lunch with him.
Who's Lieutenant Dawson?
I don't know.
Some guy coming in from NASA, I guess.
Diplomatic guy or something.
Major Nelson, Lieutenant Dawson here.
You're Lieutenant Dawson?
Yes.
She's Lieutenant Dawson.
Well, I'm Major Healey.
How do you do?
How are you?
Hi.
Did you have a nice flight?
Magic carpet service all the way.
Yeah, magic carpet service I just blinked my eyes and I was here.
Yeah, that's not Dawson, that's Jeannie.
My name's not Jeannie.
Don't you think that's informal, calling her by her first name?
You promised you wouldn't make trouble.
Blink out of here.
What are you talking about?
You're not gonna blink?
You know how she gets when she doesn't blink.
We gotta get her out of here.
I'll get her anywhere.
Husband?
Husband, I am so sorry.
I did not mean to cause trouble.
I Wha?
What are you doing here?
Major Nelson, what is going on?
Yeah, what's going on?
I'm sorry.
I got a little confused.
Uh, I thought you were her.
And I thought she, of course, was you.
Would you take her to lunch, please?
Yeah.
Well, I don't like it Not her.
Her.
Will someone take me to lunch?
I liked her in the first place.
See ya.
Shall we go to lunch?
Oh, yes, master!

Hi, Suzanne.
Nice talking to you.
No's a no.
Ouch!
Oh.
Hi, Tony.
Oh.
Hey.
Hey, that's nice.
That's good-looking.
That's gorgeous.
Is that the new, uh, Air Force dress uniform?
Eh I thought you were Dr. Bellows.
Don't let anybody in while I change, huh?
Uh, guard that door.
Well, I spend more time watching doors.
Hey, look, I like your uniform.
I don't think the red is, uh, too Air Force though.
It's Yeah, well, it was a present from Jeannie.
She thinks Air Force uniforms are too drab.
Yeah, well, you accepted it.
What do you want?
Well, I didn't have a chance to refuse.
Popped it on me about 30 seconds ago.
You know Jeannie.
She's full of surprises.
Yeah, Roge.
I don't know what to do though.
I mean, every time there's occasion to give, uh, some kind of present, she pops in an incredibly expensive one.
Yeah.
Like a chateau, or a yacht, or a car.
That's the saddest thing I've ever heard.
And, you know, I hate to keep putting her down and everything, but I have to tell her to put 'em back, don't I?
That's not only sad, that's pathetic.
And tomorrow is Tomorrow night is our 6-month wedding anniversary.
Six months, mind you.
And I know she's got some extraordinary occasion planned, and I don't know what to do.
I don't know how to tell her to stop.
What's with the red suit though?
I mean, what's with the tassel?
Oh, that's the second anniversary of my being promoted to a major.
A drum major's outfit.
Very appropriate.
Excuse me.
Major Nelson, I wonder if I could ask you a favor.
Ahh!
Oh, well, your Your drum arrived.
Major Nelson.
What the devil's going on here?
You You broke Tony's drum.
I broke it?
Put your foot right through it.
I All right, sir.
I can have it re-skinned.
Would you mind telling me what a bass drum is doing in your office anyway?
Yeah, well, he's very musical.
It's for my nephew, sir.
It's a gift.
You were saying, before you came in?
Oh, yes.
Yes.
They're painting the offices opposite mine.
The fumes blow in, and it's positively killing my chiflera.
Really?
I didn't know you were ill, sir.
That plant, major.
Here, give it to me.
Yes.
I, uh I just wondered if you could, uh, keep it here until they're finished?
Oh, certainly.
Yes, sir.
Oh, thank you.
Now, you keep it out of direct sunlight.
Over here would be fine.
Now you, uh, feed it a pint of water twice a day, and give it, uh Uh, six units of vitamin B. How about some vitamin C?
Then it won't catch a cold.
Ha-ha.
I know, gentlemen, this sounds ridiculous.
But it's a present from Amanda, and I wouldn't want to hurt her feelings.
I realize, commander, that the Navy's a good deal more relaxed than the other services, but that is no reason to forget a military courtesy like the salute.
Do you agree, commander?
Oh, yes, sir.
Absolutely.
Well then?
Take it off, commander.
This is not the deck of a destroyer.
Hey, Jay.
Hi, Jay.
Well I had to run into the general.
Yeah, I saw.
So, what's What's with the mittens?
Oh.
Stella gave it to me for my birthday.
Yeah.
Uh, she made it herself.
We're having lunch, and I thought she'd get a kick out of seeing me wear it.
At least I don't have to worry about women buying me presents.
Uh, Stella knitted that, huh?
It's really great.
Yeah.
If, uh If your right arm is six inches longer than your left.
Say, um, why don't you and Stella come over for coffee tonight?
Huh?
About 9:00?
Huh?
Yeah.
Bring the sweater.
I'd like Jeannie to see that.
Oh, sure.
Great.
We'd love to.
Good.
Then, 9:00.
See you tonight.
Okay.
That's it.
What's it?
The The sweater.
When they come over tonight, I'll praise that sweater to the skies, and try to impress Jeannie that a handmade gift is much more appreciated than one of those extravagant things she blinks up for me.
Yeah, with your luck, Jeannie will probably knit you a yacht.
Oh, they are a nice couple, are they not?
Yeah.
And those pictures of the baby were adorable.
Mm.
Six weeks old and already starting to suck his thumb.
Mm.
Master?
Mm-hm?
Did you like Amanda Russell's sweater, or were you just being polite?
No, no.
I really liked it.
And the nice thing about it is that Stella made it herself, you know.
Now, I'd rather have something made by your sweet little hands than Than Than drum major's suit.
You did not like it?
Oh, I did.
I did.
I liked it a lot.
The next time I lead a band, I'm gonna wear it.
No, I was just speaking generally.
Master, you know something.
What?
I love you.
Ha.
I love you too.
And I'm going to prove it to you.
How?
I am not going to tell you.
It's going to be a surprise.
If I could reach it, I'd pat myself on the back.
Hello.
Is, uh, Tracy Cernan there?
Oh, she's not?
Will you, uh, tell her I can't make our date tonight?
She's a out of town.
Yeah.
Never mind.
Yeah.
Cancel that message.
Major Healy.
Oh.
Oh, hi, Jeannie.
Haven't you got the wrong office?
Oh, no, no.
I wish to talk to you.
Oh, about what?
I have the most wonderful idea.
Mm-hm?
Mm.
I want to make my master a sweater for our six-month wedding anniversary.
Now, whatever made you think of that?
I do not know.
It just came to me.
Heh.
But my problem is, how do I go about it?
I don't think I can help you with knitting, but, uh, if you'd like to crochet, I'm very good at that.
Hey, hey, it worked.
What worked?
Listen, I was just about to When did?
Hey.
Uh, don't touch that.
That's Uh That's a spring.
A spring.
I was just, uh Say, I was talking to myself and, uh I, uh What are you looking for?
Oh, I'm looking for some paper clips.
Shh.
It is a secret.

Okay.
Listen, I know you're busy.
I'll check with you later, okay?
Yeah.
Later.
Okay.
Yeah.
Hey.
You can come out now.
I'm sorry, Major Healy, but I did not wish to ruin the surprise.
Yeah.
Well Now, how do I make a sweater?
Uh, how do you make a sweater?
Well, um, I suppose we could, uh, get some wool.
Get some wool.
And, uh some, uh What do you call those long?
Uh, knitting needles?
Knitting needles.
And a A pattern.
Oh, a pattern.
A pattern.
Wh What?
What is the very best kind of wool?
The best kind of wool?
Uh Uh, cashmere, probably.
Tsk.
Cashmere.
Of course.
Why did I not think of that myself?
Oh, thank you, Major Healy.
And if I have enough wool left over, I shall knit you a sock.
Uh.
See you, Jeannie.
Nice talking to you.
Yes.
Goodbye.
Yeah.
Uh, just what I needed.
One cashmere sock.
There they are, major.
Aren't they gorgeous?
Yeah.
They're really lovely.
Mm.
You know, they're very old too.
They're very, very old.
They belonged to Alfred's grandmother.
She gave them to me right after we were married.
I know.
Jeannie's admired them so much, and I was thinking if I could match them, they'd make a perfect anniversary present.
Oh.
Anniversary?
Why, major, you've only been married for six months.
Uh, well, Jeannie likes to have an anniversary every month.
She doesn't think one a year is enough.
You newlyweds.
You know, Alfred thinks one a year is too much.
Yeah.
Uh.
Well, if you take that down to Yamamoto's, downtown, they have marvelous cultured pearls.
I'm sure that they could match them for you.
I certainly appreciate this, Mrs. Bellows.
Major, you have a chiflera.
Huh?
The plant.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, major, I gave one of them to Alfred, and he just adores it.
Oh, yes, well, you take good care of that now.
I certainly will.
Bye.
Thank you so much.
You're welcome.
Heh-heh.
Oh.
Doctor Bellows.
Doctor Bellows!
What are you doing?
Major, what are you doing out there?
Take this, sir.
Take it.
But I distinctly asked you to take care of my You'll understand in a minute.
Ah!
Surprise!
Oh, darling.
I came by to see Major Nelson Oh, now, Alfred, I know you adore your chiflera, but you don't have to carry it around.
Ha.
Not with you, dear.
Come on   Jeannie, it's me, Roge!
Oh, come on in, Major Healy.
The door is open.
Come Tsk.
Oh.
Hi, Jeannie.
I came as quick as I could.
Hey, what's wrong?
Why can't I tell Tony?
Well, you see, I have a problem.
Wait.
Wait.
Don't tell me.
Well, I did as you said, Major Healy.
I bought the needles, the scissors, the pattern.
But my problem is how do I get the cashmere off the goat?
Yeah.
The cashmere off the goat.
Yeah, it's It's a goat all right.
Hi.
Wh?
W-where did you get the goat?
From Tibet.
It is a Cashmere goat.
Um  Boy, I'm gonna have to get rid of my old cashmere sweaters.
Wait.
I thought you weren't gonna blink presents for Tony.
Oh, I did not blink him.
Hm.
I went to Tibet and I bought him.
You went to Tibet?
Boy, that's dumb.
I mean, really dumb.
You could have gone down to the store.
You  All I did was I wanted to buy my master a present, and make it with my own two hands, like any ordinary wife.
And now I've gone and I've messed it all up.
No, you haven't, Jeannie.
Look, I'm sorry.
I mean, I would have done the same thing.
I mean, where else would you get a A Tibetan Cashmere goat?
Tibet.
Yeah, T Tibetan.
Jeannie.
Jeannie?
Jeannie?
Look, I'm sorry.
Why don't we We'll get Tony's electric razor, we can shave it off and dye it, and then we can block it.
And we can knit one and pearl two.
Oh Major Healy, you are almost as brilliant as my master.
Please, do not tell him anything, will you?
Oh.
Wild goats couldn't drag it out of me.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh.
Go and delay him.
Go delay him while I hide everything.
Please hurry.
Hide.

She'd love those.
Yeah.

Great.
Great.
What is that smell?
That's my after-shave.

Wow.
What's the matter?
I don't know.
That smell.
Give me a piece of that candy over there, will you?
Okay.
Uh, the candy's all gone.
It can't be all gone.
It was full this morning.
Anyway, you don't want to spoil your appetite.
It's my appetite.
Just give me a piece of candy.
Uh, Jeannie, uh, T-Tony wants a piece of candy and spoil his appetite.
Oh, it is all Oh!

Goodbye, master, darling.
How Have a good day.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'm not going to work.

Why not?
Well, uh, for one thing, I haven't had a chance to shave.
I can't find my electric razor.
Oh.
Well.
There.
You are all shaved.
I shall see you tonight.
Now, wait a minute.
Uh, secondly, I haven't had my breakfast yet.
Oh.
How thoughtless of me.
Yeah.
There you are, darling.
It is one of those instant breakfasts.
It is very nourishing.
Oh.
Yeah.
W Mm-hm.
We And thirdly, uh, today's Saturday.
I don't go to work on Saturday, you know?
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Are you, uh, planning on staying home all day?
Well, I have a couple of errands to run this morning.
Oh, good, darling.
Have a nice errand.
Now Hey.
Ever since I walked in this room, you've been trying to hustle me out of here.
W-what's happening, huh?
Oh.
I How could you say that, darling?
I I I am perfectly delighted to have you at home, so I can love you and pamper you and And cater to your every whim.
Marvelous, marvelous.
Yes, darling.
You definitely shall stay home, and you shall go right back to bed, and I shall bring you your breakfast.
Listen.
You don't have to go overboard.
The kitchen's fine.
I'll eat there.
Oh, no, darling.
I insist.
Look, Jeannie, will you stop blinking.
I'm getting dizzy with all of this.
Then you certainly should lie down.
Huh?
Hey.
Jeannie, what's going on?
Oh.
Well, why fight it?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, hello, Mrs., uh Mrs. Bellows.
How are you doing?
Oh, Major Nelson, good morning.
I hope I didn't wake you.
Uh, no.
I've been up twice already.
Well, I'm calling about the pearls.
Wondering if you've been able to match them yet.
I was going over to Yamamoto's this morning.
Oh, good.
You see, Alfred and I are going to a dinner party tonight, and I wanted to wear them.
No problem.
I'll drop 'em off at your place before noon.
Oh, that's fine.
Thank you very much, major.
Okay.
Bye.
Please, goat.
I do not have much time.
All I want is a little of your wool.
Jeannie.
I'd like to talk to you.
Oh, dear.
Say, Jeannie.
Do you know anything about this?
Oh.
Y Y-your jacket.
No, it's not the jacket.
It's what happened to the jacket.
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Uh, moth?
Mo Djinn Djinn.
Is that dog back here?
No, no, master.
Honestly, I would never do that.
I would never bring him back.
Not without asking you.
Look, Jeannie.
It's not what happened to the jacket.
It was what was in the pocket that I'm worried about.
Oh.
What was in the pocket, master?
Nothing.
No, nothing.
Well, there must have been.
You said It's all right.
Forget it.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
It's okay.
Must be around here somewhere.
Oh.
Candy?
Master.
Wh M-master.
Uh when are you going on your errand?
As soon as I find what I'm looking for.
Well, if you tell me what it is, I could help you.
Uh, no, that's all right.
You You go on doing what you were doing.
Oh.
Hey.
What's going on?
Oh, it's the The sonic boom.
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Uh Master, it seems that we are getting in each other's way this morning.
So if you do not mind, I think I will leave you for a little while.
That's not a bad idea.
Okay.
Have fun, darling.
Now I gotta find those pearls.
Uh Now, Mr. Goat, you are finally going to get sheared.
Jeannie.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
What's that goat doing here?
Oh, well.
You see, I am knitting Anthony a sweater.
He is what I am knitting it out of.
If I can ever get him sheared.
Ah.
I see.
Oh, Jeannie, I'm terribly sorry to tell you, but this is a military installation.
Uh We don't allow goats here.
Oh, please, Dr. Bellows, he will not harm anything.
And I must get the sweater finished by tonight.
Tonight?
Mm-hm.
And you haven't even sheared the wool yet?
Oh, Jeannie, I'm afraid that's impossible.
You see, the wool has to be washed and hung up to dry for several days.
And it has to be dyed and carded, and spun into yarn.
It's not just as if you could blink your eyes and have it all done.
No.
No, no, it is not.
If it were up to me, I'd let you work here, but if General Schaeffer ever came and found a goat, well  I'm sorry, Jeannie, but you'll have to go.
I understand, Dr. Bellows.
Oh.
Come on, goat.
Come on.
There you go.
Tsk.
Major, this is just terrible.
What are we going to do?
I don't know, Mrs. Bellows.
For the last four hours, I went over that house inch by inch, and they just disappeared.
I'm sorry.
I don't know what to say.
Oh, major, there's nothing to say.
Oh.
What am I going to tell?
Alfred?
Tell Alfred what?
I'll, uh I'll tell him, Mrs. Bellows.
Well, sir, do you know that string of pearls that your grandmother gave Mrs. Bellows when you got married?
Mm-hm.
Well, I'm afraid I lost them.
No, you didn't.
What?
Alfred, he's trying to tell you.
Now, I did lose them, sir.
No, no, no.
You may have lost some pearls, major, but they were only paste imitations.
What?
Well, you see, uh, Amanda's very careless about jewelry.
I never let her run around with the, uh Uh, valuable string of pearls like that Mm-hm.
So, uh, I had some imitations made.
Oh.
And I locked up the real ones in the safe at NASA.
What are you talking about?
I am not careless.
You lent them to Major Nelson, and he lost them.
Mm-hm.
Now, need I say more?
I hate him when he's right.
Oh, Alfred, you old fuddy-duddy, you.
Uh Uh, Dr. Bellows.
I I was gonna match those pearls for a present for Jeannie.
It's their six-month anniversary tonight.
I know.
I Yes, and I was wondering if we could get to NASA right away.
Maybe there's still time.
All right.
Let's give it a try.
Here we go.
Jeannie?
Honey, are you here?
Hey.
What are you doing in there?
Come on out.
I want to talk to you.
Hey, what's the matter?
Are you mad at me?
Come on out.
All right.
Uh blink me in there.
Oh.
Oh, master.
I am a failure as a wife.
Honey.
Darling, now, wait a minute.
What's the matter?
I  What is it?
I wanted to make you a sweater for our anniversary with my own two hands, without blinking, with no magic.
And I bought the goat, and I bought the pattern, and I bought the knitting needles.
Yes?
And I could not do it.
I would have to blink.
And I have nothing for our anniversary.
Oh.
Oh, come on.
Come on, it's all right.
Oh, what is so funny?
Well, I'll tell you.
Wait till you hear.
I borrowed Mrs. Bellows' pearls to have them matched for you, and And the goat, uh I lost them.
And by By the time I found them, all the stores were closed, and there's nothing I could do about 'em.
So I I don't have anything for you either.
Nothing?
Not a thing.
Oh.
Oh, that is wonderful.
Oh.
Hey.
Pretty cozy in here, huh?
Mm.
Why don't we have our anniversary in here?
Mm.
Master.
Hm?
What is that noise?
I haven't the slightest idea.
And I don't even care.
Mm.
Mm.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Hello?
Hello?
Oh, please, someone answer.
Hello, NASA?
Uh, this is Jeannie Nelson.
May I speak to Major Anthony?
Uh, what?
Oh, well, I do not know.
This phone seems to be working.
Oh, yes, please, may I speak to Major Anthony Nelson?
He what?
He left already?
Oh.
Thank you very much.
Ooh.
Oh, dear, it is not safe to be out in a storm like this.
I am sorry, master, but you belong at home.
Oh.
Oh.
Thank heavens you're safe.
Don't Don't touch me.
I'm sopping wet, darling.
Hey, that's some blow out there.
My car broke down three blocks away.
Well, the first thing we must do is get you out of those wet clothes and into a hot tub.
Yeah.
Well, I called NASA, and when they said you were not there, I got so worried.
Well, I'm gonna be there in 10 minutes.
That's what I was looking for.
You are not going out again.
Sweetheart, this hurricane is right over the primary recovery area.
I've got to talk down Mattingly and Forbes.
Look, my car's broken down.
Dr. Bellows is waiting for me.
If the storm gets any worse, I'm gonna be staying at NASA, okay?
But, darling, your clothes.
I don't have time to change, sweetheart.
I just don't have time.
Oh.
You all right?
Oh, Major Nelson, there's no use Major Nelson, what are you wearing?
Huh?
Oh.
Oh, the lights.
Uh Uh Uh, power failure, sir.
Oh, it is all right.
I can No.
I don't want you to do anything.
Go light some candles.
No need to snap, major.
I'm sorry, sir.
I I guess I'm just, uh, nervous.
You know, with Mattingly and Forbes up there, I'm gonna have to talk 'em down.
I Uh.
I'm just nervous, that's all.
Oh.
Oh.
Then why, may I ask, are you lounging around in a bathrobe when we've got to get to the base?
Oh, well, uh, I'll change right away, sir.
Jeannie insisted that I change into some dry clothes.
You know how wives are about that, so, uh, that's why I put this bathrobe on.
I see.
Oh.
Put this on, Dr. Bellows.
I shall make some hot soup.
Oh, thank you, Jeannie.
This looks like the one you were wearing, major.
When was that, sir?
When I came in, you were standing there It's amazing what an electrical storm can do to your perception.
I think you'd better come in here and use my bathroom before you get a chill.
Just go right in there, sir.
Uh, thank you.
Yes, sir.
Now, Jeannie, it looks like Dr. Bellows is gonna be marooned here until after the hurricane.
Oh.
Well, that is fine.
He He can sleep up in the study.
Good.
Good.
Now, I-I know I don't have to say this, but no tricks, huh?
Oh, no, darling.
Of course not.
Good.
See.
Now, look, this is exactly what I mean.
What?
There's a power failure.
Would you turn the lights off?
Oh, the lights.
Oh, but darling Turn 'em off.
Really.
Uh, you know, it just doesn't make any sense.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Turn 'em on, please.
Oh, darling.
Oh.
Just turn them off.
But darling, you I know.
Just go ahead.
Turn 'em off.
Thank you.
Agh!
Shh!
Whoo!
Whoo!
Roge, hey, what are you doing here?
I'm on my way to Miami.
What?
How?
How?
By blink.
With the most beautiful girl in all of Florida.
And what a break with this storm.
Yeah.
No lights.
Can you imagine this?
She won't be able to send me home.
Ha-ha.
All Jeannie has to do is get me to Miami.
That's all.
And, uh Uh, how do you propose that Jeannie do that?
Oh, uh, how do I?
How do I propose that, sir?
Oh, uh, well, Jeannie has a connection with the, uh With the travel bureau.
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
For all practical purposes, we're marooned right here.
Come to think of it, Major Healey, how did you get here?
It was fine when I left home, sir.
But all of a sudden I went driving down the street, and they got these big trees in there, and everything's flooded.
It's really awful.
How we gonna get to NASA, sir?
Well, we'll call.
Well, sooner or later they may send out some sort of, uh, amphibious vehicle.
Yeah, I heard on my car radio that all the telephones are definitely out of order, sir.
Oh.
Ah Uh, Jeannie, darling, the phones aren't working.
Hello, Mrs. Bellows.
This is Jeannie.
Oh, yes.
I just thought you might be worried, and I wanted to let you know that Dr. Bellows is here and safe.
Would you like to talk to him?
Here.
B B-but how?
I don't know, sir.
The phone company's always been a mystery to me.
Amanda?
Yeah, but the main thing, Steve, is to keep them absolutely current on what's happening down here.
Oh, don't try to keep anything from 'em.
Don't sound like you're trying to keep anything from them.
Delicious soup, Jeannie.
Don't make things sound better than they are.
It certainly warms you up.
Thank you, Dr. Bellows.
Tsk.
But I do not understand what Anthony is doing.
Well, Tony's supposed to talk Mattingly and Forbes down.
I know I shouldn't question good luck, but I still don't understand why your phone is the only phone in the area that's working.
Um.
I, uh Oh, here it is.
I shall clear the dishes and bring the next course.
Good.
I'll give you a hand, Jeannie.
Thank you, Dr. Bellows.
I said, have you got the oxygen remaining times relative to the recovery contingencies three and four?
I hope you like lamb, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, anything's fine, Jeannie.
I love lamb.
Uh, Jeannie, your stove.
Yes.
Yes.
Heh.
Is something the matter?
It's electric.
Oh, yes.
Is that bad?
It's not bad.
It's impossible.
There's no electricity.
Oh.
Okay.
That's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Major Nelson.
Your stove Uh, generator, sir.
The emergency generator.
Hold on, Steve.
How did you know what I was going to say?
What were you gonna say?
Why is your electric stove working?
Uh, it's an emergency generator, just like we have at NASA.
Yeah, go ahead, Jim.
Well, uh major, why aren't the lights working?
Oh.
Don't ask me, sir.
It's not my house.
Uh.
Different circuit, sir.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you see, the generator is for the stove.
It's better to eat what you're seeing than see what you're eating.
Uh, Dr. Bellows Dr. Bellows, you've said that Anthony was very important to those two brave men up in the capsule.
Now, do you not think it is more important to worry about them than about a silly, little-old electric stove, and whether it works or doesn't work?
But that's not the point.
It's simply impossible.
Well, of course, Jeannie.
You're right.
Oh, forgive me, major.
Uh, I guess this business has us all on edge.
Uh, it's perfectly understandable, sir.
But this is the most puzzling house.
First the lights, then the phone, then the stove.
Would you like some coffee, sir?
Ooh.
Oh, it's really hot.
In an electric coffee pot?
Dr. Bellows, do you like a hard bed?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, I do, major.
Uh, good.
Why don't you take the couch?
The bed's a little mushy.
Master.
Shall I stay up with you?
No, darling.
You better get some sleep.
Somebody's got to have energy in the morning to take care of Dr. Bellows and Roger.
All right.
I love you.
Mm.
I love you too.
Oh.
Yes.
Yeah, well, they know they have to conserve their oxygen.
Yeah.
Just, uh, t Tell 'em to, uh To think of that That conscious relaxation exercise we used to try.
Yeah, you know the one.
You know the one where you relax your toes?
Ah.
And the feet relax.
The legs relax  Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah, I Yeah, I know.
I almost fell asleep myself.
Yeah, well tell 'em to try that one.
Okay.
All right, Steve.
Now, look, this is the last contact we're gonna have, see.
And when they burn through  We're gonna lose all radio contact with 'em.
And, uh, hm Oh.
My poor master.
You must get some sleep.
Oh.
Oh, I can't, Jeannie.
I I can't right now.
Oh, but you must.
You have been awake so many hours, you are going to make yourself sick.
I can't get any sleep until I talk Mattingly and Forbes down.
Well, I cannot stand by and watch you make yourself sick.
I-I I just simply cannot stand it.
What are you gonna do?
There you are, master.
Now you can see.
They are safe.
Uh.
Jeannie.
What did you do?
Well, I brought them down, master, so that you could see that they are safe.
And now you can get some sleep.
Well, you get 'em right back up in that capsule.
But, master, I brought them dow Well, you get They're gonna make a reentry in about 30 seconds.
Now get 'em back up there right now.
Come on.
Yes.
Y-yes, master.
Well, do it.
Huh?

Hello, Steve.
Are you there?
Major Nelson.
Dr. Bellows.
Did you see the  All of it.
All of it.
Jeannie She folded her arms, and then And then she She blinked her eyes and And suddenly they They were here.
They were sitting right here.
And then she She blinked them again and they were gone.
And then she blinked her eyes a third time, and then she was gone.
Major Nelson, what in the name of heaven's going on here?
You're asleep.
That's what's going on.
You're asleep.
You're dreaming.
When you wake up in the morning, you're not gonna remember anything.
No.
Nonsense.
I've been No, no.
I, uh I've been up all night.
I've been worrying about Mattingly and Forbes.
I haven't I haven't slept a wink.
Yeah.
Not a wink.
Major.
Why did she wink?
Uh, wink?
Yeah.
No, a blink.
I mean Uh, you used hypnosis.
You hypnotized yourself.
No, no, no.
That's ridiculous.
I'm as awake as you are.
It was an experiment I was conducting here.
While you've been on the phone all this time?
No, it's out of the It's It's all nonsense.
Nonsense.
A mirage?
The truth!
I saw it and I want the truth.
And while you're at it, you can tell me all that's going on in this house.
The truth about that phone, the lights, the stove.
Everything!
Uh, you'd better brace yourself, sir, because the truth is rather startling.
Try me.
Well Try me!
I married a genie.
You never quit.
Do you, major?
You don't believe me?
Wait.
What's going on down here anyway?
Uh, Major Healey, I think you'd better sit down.
Yeah.
I just got up, sir.
I'm afraid you're in for quite a shock.
Shock.
A very big shock.
Major Nelson just told me that he was married to a genie.
Mm-hm.
Oh, uh Oh, well, you, uh You must be dreaming, sir.
I tried that.
Yeah, you tried that.
Oh, well, it's probably Probably some kind of self-hypnosis, sir.
I tried that.
Uh, well, it's an experiment.
That's it.
No.
Have you tried mirage?
Roger, he caught me red-handed.
I had to tell him the truth.
Did he believe it?
The question is not whether I believe it, but does Major Nelson believe it?
Well, I I believe anything you two believe.
Good night.
Roger, don't leave me here.
Uh, uh.
Now, I just want you to relax.
Now, you try to remember that I'm your friend, and I'm trying to help you, major.
Yes, sir.
Uh, ahem.
Your health is far more important than any explanation, major.
You see, we have, uh We have ways of dealing with psychoses such as yours.
In a few years of rest and quiet depth analysis.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Oh.
Yes, Anthony.
Here.
Did you call?
I want you to smoke into your bottle.
What?
Smoke into your bottle.
What?
!
Oh.
Well.
Well, he He is asleep.
He is so sleepy, he does not know what he is saying.
Uh, Jeannie, it It's all right.
Uh, I'm your master.
Smoke into your bottle.
Ah.
Darling.
Dr. Bellows.
Just do as I say.
I'm asleep.
That's That is what it is.
I I am asleep.
I am asleep.
Jeannie?
Yes, Anthony.
You called?
Yeah, I I was trying to show Dr. Bellows that you're really a genie.
You can come out.
Yes, Anthony.
That That is my name.
Jeannie.
It's all right, major.
You've made your point.
I'll, uh I'll resign my commission immediately, of course.
I Commit myself for treatment while I still have a few lucid moments left, and  Shame, really.
I I like the Air Force.
I like being a psychiatrist.
Oh.
The poor man.
Uh, sir, all you have to do is realize that there is such a thing as a genie in the world.
Of course, it'll be difficult to tell Amanda, but she'll understand.
She'll, uh, wait for me.
Dr. Bellows.
Uh Um, Jeannie, do you remember that stereopticon we used to use?
You mean the past and future machine?
Yes.
Yeah.
Would you blink it in, please?
Oh.
Ha.
Uh, there, sir.
Uh, this will probably clear things up.
Just T-take a look in here.
Oh, yes.
Uh.
Major Nelson.
Where did all this come from?
Uh, this bed, those pillows, the These curtains.
Hello, Dr. Bellows.
Major Nelson, please.
Look at me!
Look at my uniform!
What's the matter with you?
What is that?
Oh, a-a-a-a A mosquito netting, sir.
Malaria prevention.
Mosquito netting?
Yeah.
Malaria prevention?
Absolutely.
Oh, I wish you'd be more careful.
Look at this.
What was that?
Huh?
A mosquito bite.
Very painful, sir.
The whole room is full of 'em.
Hold still.
Hold still, sir.
One right there.
Ow!
What's the mat The whole room is full of them.
It must be full.
I can hear them.
Give me some of this.
Huh?
No.
Give me.
Give me!
Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
You mean to tell me that was all Jeannie?
Yes, sir.
All.
All.
And she really does live in this bottle?
No!
Huh?
No, it's all right, darling.
I'm trying to convince him.
Let him look in there.
Uh, but It's all right.
Oh!
Ah!
Shh, shh.
Oh.
It's all right.
Now, look, darling, we're married.
We don't need the bottle anymore.
Oh That's okay.
Uh, sir, would you like to take another look in there?
Of course.
I I can hardly wait.
Uh Way, hey Blow the man down  Ahoy, there!
Come aboard, major.
What?
Come out of the water.
I beg your pardon?
The water.
Oh.
Did you eat the pipchick, sir?
I certainly did.
Salt air gives you a marvelous appetite.
Ready to come about.
Come aboard!
Look out for the boom, major.
The what, sir?
The boom!
Oh.
Oh, right.
Right.
Uh, sir, I I really think you ought to come with me.
Come with you?
What for?
I'm finally doing something I've always wanted to do.
Sailing a whaler to Alaska.
Mmm.
Looks like a sou'easter's blowing up out of the nor'west.
Ah, you gotta watch out for them sou'easters.
Perhaps we ought to go below and put on our foul-weather gear, sir.
Too late for that.
Lower the lifeboats.
I'll never be able to look at myself in the mirror again.
Uh, there was one particular incident I remember that When your explanation sounded especially fishy.
You know, the time that I I thought I saw the two Martians.
Uh Uh, Jeannie, would you mind?
Go ahead.
I don't understand.
This whole base should be on red alert.
The president should've been notified.
Look.
Look at this hat.
Now, just calm down, colonel.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
But, sir.
I know it sounds crazy, but it's true.
I saw them.
Uh, green men with, um, a A Antennae, colonel?
That's right, sir.
Antennae.
They must've taken over the jet plate.
Well, there's the jet plate right now, doctor.
The gall of them to come right here to NASA.
Oh, no.
They might have vaporizers.
We'll chance it, doctor.
Go on!
You'll see.
You'll see.
Hello!
Hello in Hello in there.
Uh, we are earthlings.
We like you.
Oh, that's very kind of you, sir.
We like you too.
Well, doctor?
I must admit, major, that your explanations were extraordinarily clever.
I'll resign my commission, of course, sir.
And Jeannie and I will go away where we're not known, and start life all over again.
What a waste to the space program.
Well, I'd rather be married to Jeannie than be an astronaut, sir.
Oh, Anthony Call me "master".
Jeannie, I always thought that you were a charming and wonderful girl.
A perfect wife for Major Nelson.
Magic or no, I see no reason why I should change my opinion.
Thank you, Dr. Bellows.
Major Nelson, all things being considered and I mean all things uh, it's been a great honor and a pleasure working with you.
Uh, good luck.
Thank you, sir.
Uh, excuse me.
You better get some sleep.
Good night, darling, darling Anthony.
Master.
Master.
STEVE : Tony?
Tony, are you there?
Tony, wake up.
Hm?
What?
Oh.
Hello.
They're down, Tony.
Down.
Aboard the carrier, safe and sound.
They're down?
You're kidding.
They're down.
Hey, that's great, Steve.
And they're aboard the carrier?
Hey, that's sensational.
We did it, huh?
Okay, buddy.
Yeah, you'd better get some sleep.
I'll get some too.
Mm, yeah, well, I'm so tired, I'll probably have a nightmare now.
Okay, bye.
Where's the bottle?
The bottle was broken.
The machine.
That's what it was.
It was a nightmare.
Hey.
A nightmare.
The whole thing was a nightmare.
Dr. Bellows and the machine.
Whoo-hoo!
TONY : Whoo-hoo!
Major Nelson, what is it?
Uh M-Mattingly and Forbes.
They're down.
They're on the carrier.
What?
How marvelous.
Yeah.
Oh.
How about that?
What is all the noise about?
Uh They're down.
They're safe on the carrier.
Oh!
My hero!
Jeannie, Jeannie.
Uh, hey, where did you come from?
Yeah.
Oh.
Well, uh She's, uh From the bedroom, sir.
That's not possible.
I was standing right here.
I'll get Roger.
No, no, no.
He's not up there.
He's not up there.
Where is he?
Roge?
Wait.
There he is.
At this hour?
Wait a minute.
Oh.
Major Healey, where are you going?
I'm going to Miami with Nancy.
Take a trip.
Blink me in.
Goodbye.
Good night all.
That's quite an answer.
Goodbye.
No, no, no, no.
Not on the couch.
You'll get the couch wet.
Not my bottle.
Wake up.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
You call for me, sir?
Oh, yes.
Come in, Major Healey.
Yes, sir.
Major, you know Captain Phelps, the security officer?
Well, we've crossed each other's paths, uh, unofficially, of course.
Captain Phelps is conducting an investigation, and he'd like to ask you some questions.
Oh, me, sir?
Oh, sit down, major.
This is quite informal.
Yeah, sit down.
Yes, sir.
Sit down.
It's informal.
Yeah.
We've gotten quite a number of complaints, and, uh, we've called you in because you have, uh, well, shall we say a A certain reputation.
Yeah, well, sir, if it's about that gal in the PX, I mean, she was a little No, major.
It's not that.
Those two girls in Accounting, that was my fault.
Major, we're not interested in your girls.
At least, uh, not at present.
We've called you in because you have a reputation of, uh, knowing where the action is.
Well, it's certainly not in Accounting.
Major.
We are trying to get a line on a card shark who has been fleecing the men.
A card shark?
Yes.
Obviously, there's some crooked poker games going on in town and, uh, they're causing quite a financial hardship for some of the men.
We thought you might know something that might help us track it down.
Well, you have any idea who it is, sir?
Well, that's what we're trying to find out, major.
Whoever he is, he's a smooth operator.
And he's been setting up an awful lot of poker games.
Well, it could be a civilian or, I hate to say this, but, uh, it could be somebody on the base.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were having a meeting.
It's all right, Major Nelson.
Uh, it's nothing important.
I was just wondering if you all would like to come over and play a little poker at my house tonight.
That's it.
Nine, 10.
There we go.
Master.
Hm?
I do not know why you want me to go to the movies while you play that funny game.
Well, the funny game is called poker, darling.
And I don't want you to go to the movies.
It's just kind of a tradition that when the menfolks play poker, the womenfolks don't hang around.
Well, it must not be a very nice game.
When Uncle Abdulla played Parcheesi, he always let the whole harem watch.
Yeah.
Those were the days.
Major Healey, would it bother you if I stayed and watch?
Jeannie, I'm trying to stack these chips.
Oh.
Well, why did you not say so?
I'll get it.
Hello.
Major.
How are you?
Major, I'd like you to meet Senator Martino.
Colonel Forbes couldn't come tonight, so the senator will make our fifth.
Oh, great.
Well, come on in, senator.
Thank you.
I'd like you to meet my wife, uh, Jeannie.
And this is Major Roger Healey.
Well, hello.
How do you do?
Uh, actually, I just met Senator Martino.
He's a state senator from one of our neighboring states, and he said he liked poker, so I brought him along.
I hope you don't mind.
No.
Welcome aboard, sir.
Uh, Major Healey, what is that?
Oh, that.
Uh, yeah, well, we're playing for high stakes.
Well, shall we begin?
I'll sit over here.
Sit over there.
I feel lucky.
Ah, good.
Uh, how about a little spit in the ocean?
Are you going to the seashore?
I thought you were going to play cards.
Um, cut the deal.
Well, I'm going to the movies now.
Goodbye, gentlemen.
Goodbye.
Goodbye, darling.
Bye.
Uh, okay, I'll up that one.
I-I could stay and serve the refreshments.
No, darling, I'll take care of that.
Thanks.
Oh, all right.
Bye.
Bye.
Boy, I wish I had some more of those.
I'll, uh, walk you to the door, darling.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodbye, gentleman.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Thank you.
Darling.
Oh, poker does not look like much fun, anyway.
All they do is jump up and down.
Goodbye, darling.
You look cute.
Bye.
It was a nice idea.
Bye.
Well, that's too rich for my blood.
Well, I'll, uh, see you and, uh, I'll raise you.
Okay.
All right.
I'll just see you, Roger.
What you got?
Full house.
Queens high.
Uh, sorry.
Uh, full house.
Aces over eights.
Not again!
Sorry.
It must be my lucky night.
I don't know.
Ahem, funny way to treat your, heh, commanding officer.
Well, I've had enough.
I've never seen such a run of luck in my life.
I just lost $23.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
Yeah.
I dropped about 40.
Well, that may be true, major, but, uh, you don't have to tell your wife.
Well, major, when are you giving us a chance to get even?
How about Tuesday night?
Oh, well, I'm Uh, not Tuesday night.
My My wife is not too happy about this already.
Tuesday night will be fine.
Are you sure you're not that card shark who's working the area?
Hm?
Oh.
Oh, yeah.
"Nimble Fingered" Nelson they call me, huh?
Oh.
Well, gentlemen, thank you very much.
I sure appreciate that.
Oh, hi, Roge.
What are you doing here?
Hey, great day, huh?
Say, uh, when we're finished this test, why don't we go out and have a little round of golf?
How much a hole?
What's the matter with you?
Oh, nothing, Nimble Fingers.
Hey, since when have you been such a sore loser?
Since I don't have a genie.
Now, what are you talking about?
She wasn't even there last night.
Well, let's put it this way.
I didn't see her there last night.
Roger, do you think I'd cheat my best friend, Dr. Bellows, General Schaeffer and a senator?
Well, you wouldn't cheat them, but you know Jeannie.
She doesn't like to see you lose at anything.
Was anybody suspicious?
Are you kidding, boss?
Pretending to be a state senator was the greatest idea I ever had in my life.
It was my idea!
You should've seen that Major Nelson's face light up when I dealt him the four aces.
He thinks he's the greatest poker player in the world.
I am the greatest poker player in the world.
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah.
That's right, boss.
I know, I know.
I I was just setting them up for the kill.
Well, when is the big payoff?
Tuesday night.
I'm raising the stakes.
The major's fat and the rest of them are hungry.
Heh.
Ah, you got nothing to worry about, boss.
I'll clean 'em out.
Nobody can beat me in a crooked poker game.
E-except you, boss.
Master, I swear to you.
I know, darling.
I know.
It was just It was just luck.
I know that.
Do you not like your food?
How can I eat when my best friend thinks I'm a card shark?
Oh, Major Healey would not think that about you.
Oh, yeah, he does.
I wish I didn't have to play tonight.
I might win.
Oh, boy.
May I stay and watch?
Oh, I'm sorry, Jeannie.
I I don't want to give Roger the chance to think that you're helping me again.
Very well, I will stay in my bottle.
Eat your food, dear.
It is getting cold.
I'm not hungry, sweetheart.
I'm just not hungry.
But you need your nourishment.
There.
You feel better?
Mm, yeah.
Yeah, I do.
Well, I got my vitamins, anyhow.
Hey, I know what.
The best thing that could happen.
What?
If Roger could win.
Would you like that?
Yeah.
Oh Oh.
Yeah.
All mine.
Well, now what, guys?
Guys?
Hey, wait a minute.
You're not leaving.
It's early.
Good night, Major Healey.
I think I'll go home and take a nice, warm bath.
We just took a bath.
Four royal flushes in a row.
That's impossible.
The odds against it are astronomical.
Yeah, well, I'm an astronomical.
I mean, I'm an astronaut.
And I'm a genie.
Four royal flushes in a row!
Yeah, yeah, but But, boss, I tried everything: The marked cards, dealing seconds.
But But But this guy's like Like Like magic.
Yeah?
Well, he ain't moving in on my territory.
Rub him out!
Not him, birdbrain!
Major Healey.
Oh!
Hello, Mama.
How are you?
Oh, I am just fine, thank you.
Uncle Ali Baba?
All 40 of them?
Oh, Mama, that man keeps terrible company.
Oh, yes, yes.
Oh, I would love to.
But of course, I will have to ask my master.
Yes.
I'll call you back later.
Bye-bye.
Good morning, darling.
Hello.
Oh, do you mind, darling, if I see?
What is the matter?
Huh?
Oh, no I was just trying to think of a way to tell Roger that you helped him win at poker last night.
That's all.
Oh.
I I am I am very sorry, master, but you said that it would make you happy.
I know.
I'll think of something.
Uh, darling, would you mind if I went to visit Mama for a couple of hours this morning?
Huh?
Well, you You see, she is cleaning out her attic and And she wants to see if there's anything I would like.
Oh.
Yeah.
All right, go ahead.
Uh, don't say hello for me.
There's no sense in getting her mad.
Oh, darling, do not worry.
She will come to love you yet.
Oh, yeah.
Goodbye, dear.
Have a good time.
Hi, Ton.
Oh, hello, Roge.
Hey, listen, can you hurry it up a little?
I want to stop by at the boatyard.
Boatyard?
Yeah.
You know the money I won last night?
I made a down payment on a new speedboat.
Um, Roge, look, I hate to tell you this, but you didn't win last night.
Jeannie did.
Jeannie wasn't playing last night.
Yeah, she did.
You know, with her blinks.
Oh, I see.
When you win, it's skill.
And when I win, it's blink, blink, blink.
You think you got four royal flushes in a row?
You have to give that money back.
Come on, you're putting me on.
I mean, I can't do that.
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I go into General Schaeffer's office and I'll say, uh, "General, about last night.
We We really didn't win.
We cheated".
Scratch one astronaut.
A little shaky, isn't it?
Yeah, a little shaky.
Well, we could say Jeannie did it.
No, no, we couldn't say Jeannie did it.
Well, we'll think of something.
Yeah, well, while you're thinking of something, I'll get the boat and we'll have fun until it's repossessed.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Oh, good morning, sir.
A beautiful morning, isn't it?
Yes.
For winners maybe, major.
I'd rather not discuss that subject, gentlemen.
Have you got those training schedules ready, major?
Oh, yes, sir.
I have them in my office.
Oh, sir, uh, excuse me.
Could I speak to you for a minute?
Why, yes, of course.
I just wanted to bring you up to date on our investigation of the, uh, card shark.
How is it?
You caught him yet?
We're closing in.
The trouble is, it may be more than one man.
Maybe a team.
A team?
Oh, yes, sir.
Sometimes, in order to avoid suspicion, one man will win one night and then he'll lose the next night while his partner wins.
Oh, I see.
Well, we'll get him, sir.
We're keeping our eyes open for any unusual lucky streaks or We're also on the lookout for any sudden affluence.
You know, somebody who seems to be living above their income.
Oh, Jeannie.
Oh, good morning, Jeannie.
Good morning, General Schaeffer, Dr. Bellows.
Oh, dear.
Could you help me?
Uh, yes.
Thank you.
Anthony, darling.
As soon as I get that, I'll forward it on to you.
From Mama.
Huh?
Are they not beautiful?
Carry on.
Uh What is all this junk?
Oh Oh, hello, sir.
As you were, major.
I will only be a moment, gentlemen.
I just wanted to show Anthony these beautiful things I got today.
Oh, look, lovely gold candlesticks.
Yes.
Oh, lovely.
Are they not beautiful?
And this Ming vase.
Uh-huh.
And this antique ivory elephant.
Isn't he adorable?
Oh, that's cute.
Yeah.
Oh, and look.
Look at this darling ruby pin.
Oh, they certainly look expensive.
On a major's pay.
Oh, we could not possibly afford these things on Anthony's salary.
No, it's just junk.
Her mother gave it to her.
Tell them your mother gave them to you.
Oh, yes.
Mama gave them to us.
Oh, well, they were just gathering dust in her attic.
TONY : Yeah.
I see.
Oh, and look at this adorable diamond ring.
I have always wanted a diamond ring.
That's a diamond?
Fake.
Why, it certainly is not fake.
My mama would not have a fake diamond ring.
Look!
Ha-ha.
General, Dr. Bellows.
Guess what.
I bought that speedboat anyway.
Hey, you don't think that they think that I don't think I don't think anything.
Well, I'll tell you what I think they think I think.
I think they think I know what you think.
A lot of guys have speedboats.
Not a lot of guys have emerald-studded Ming vases.
Dr. Bellows wouldn't think anything of us.
We probably have a guilty conscience because we cheated.
We didn't cheat.
Jeannie is the one that cheated.
That makes a difference.
Yes?
Yes.
Yes, sir.
Tonight?
Eight o'clock?
Oh, I'm afraid that, uh Yes, well, all All right.
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.
They want to have a game here tonight.
Just tonight Tonight?
Hey, wait a minute, Roger.
This is the perfect opportunity to let them win.
Even if we have to cheat to let 'em win.
That's not gonna be easy.
Dr. Bellows can't win with a seven-card-no-peaky-high-low baseball with one-eyed jacks and deuces wild.
Well, they gotta win somehow.
Wait a minute.
Jeannie!
Jeannie!
Come on.
Come on.
But, master, I I thought you did not wish me to interfere with your poker game.
But this is different.
General Schaeffer and Dr. Bellows Well, they have to win.
And you've got to win for them.
Yeah.
Just do one of your favorite blink tricks.
Oh, very well.
Then I will stand behind each one as they get their cards and then they will win.
No, darling.
That's not what we're talking about.
Oh, I understand.
You do not wish me to be so obvious.
Really quick, Jeannie.
I know.
I know, I will blink a magic chair and then whoever sits in it will win.
Sensational.
That's exactly what I was talking Oh, that's good.
That's good, Jeannie.
They'll never suspect a thing.
That's obvious.
Nice and quiet.
That's not obvious, is it?
No.
Never suspect that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I will fix it.
Yeah, well, that's better.
That's a lot better.
Oh, good.
Now you have a magic chair and I do not have to be here tonight.
You see, Mama called, and she invited me to the sultan's palace.
It is the sultan's wedding anniversary.
Heh-heh.
Of course, every day is the sultan's wedding anniversary.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, you go.
You go and have a wonderful time.
Yes, dear.
Mwah.
Good.
Hey, Roge, uh, how about a little game, huh?
Ah, good.
Good.
I'll tell you what  Out.
But, boss, you just said Out.
I am going to show you why I am the boss and you ain't.
These here guys wanna dump you in the bottom of the river.
But I say that is a waste.
And I hate waste.
A guy with a talent like yours ought to use it.
Like tonight, for us.
Now, what do you say?
Help!
I guess sometimes you got to have waste.
Don't you know it's against the law to pollute the river?
We will risk it.
What?
Hey, wait a minute.
What's that?
That is your one-way ticket to the bottom of the river.
I put my feet in there and the cement goes on and I go down to the bottom.
Okay, um, what do you want me to do?
Just win.
Big.
Mm-hm?
Okay.
And remember, the senator will have this just to make sure you do.
Oh, I'll win.
I'm a winner.
Lucky me.
That is our boy.
Captain Phelps, I really don't think this is necessary.
Sir, the motto in our line of work is suspect everybody.
Major Nelson and Major Healey are two of our finest men.
That simply isn't possible.
Well, of course.
It's out of the question.
Sir, look at it this way.
By keeping watch outside the Nelsons' house tonight, we are giving them an opportunity to clear themselves.
Where have you guys been?
We've been waiting for you.
Yeah, I got a little tied up.
Come on.
Tony, I gotta talk to you Oh!
I wanted to say hello.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Well, come on, let's get this game going.
The same stakes tonight, gentlemen.
I thought we might up them a little bit.
Feeling lucky again, major?
No Are we?
No.
No, not at all.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll just sit down here.
Sit down.
That's the general's chair.
Oh, yeah.
That's all right.
I'll sit in this chair.
You sat in that one there the last time.
Try this one.
It might change your luck.
Well, it doesn't make any difference.
It doesn't make any difference   Come on, sit down, major.
We came to play cards, not musical chairs.
Come on, gentlemen, let's get going.
Let's get going.
Yeah.
Shall we, uh, start to deal?
All right.
Nice chair.
What do you got there?
Queen.
Oh.
All right.
Here we are.
Five-card stud.
Ante one.
What stakes would you like to bet for, uh?
Oh, I don't care.
Ten?
Twenty?
How about uh, one, two and five?
One, two and five is fine.
That's all right to start with.
We can raise it later.
I'm due for better cards.
Ace bet, sir?
Uh, well, I I can't insult an ace.
Uh, I open for, uh Well, let's live dangerously, huh?
Yeah.
Uh Uh, 10 blues.
Yeah, well, that finishes me.
Well, it seems to be my night, huh?
Wow.
That's funny how we all had a streak of luck.
Yours is certainly running out, major.
Yeah.
I'll say.
Oh, your deal.
Mine.
Cement mixer  Hey, that's an oldie.
Maybe it's coming back.
Maybe it's coming back.
Yeah.
Well, uh  we're gonna play a new game.
Uh, it's called seven-card switch.
Switch?
Yeah.
We're all dealt seven cards and we turn the first card down and everybody moves one chair to the right.
Oh, come on, Roge.
Let's just stick to straight poker, huh?
Yeah.
Let's have some action!
Come on, Roger.
Let's just play straight poker.
Let's have some action.
We need some more peanuts.
We don't need any peanuts.
We need some fresh peanuts.
Come on.
What's the matter with you?
Major Healey, we're waiting.
Uh, I just decided we're gonna play some seven-card switch.
Uh, you get seven cards and you deal one and you turn it over and then you move one chair to the river The right.
Straight flush.
Beat that.
Sorry, sir.
Royal flush.
That's five in a row.
Uh Yeah, that's right.
Royal flush.
Ah!
Who was that?
Yes, sir?
I didn't want to believe it, but there's your card shark.
Where's your card shark?
He has trick cards.
What is happening?
Everything.
Do something.
I have Oh, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
You're making a mistake.
I mean, I'm not a card shark.
Why, there's your card shark.
Oh.
Come now, Major Healey.
Don't call him "major".
Call him Number 47658.
Wait a minute.
Wait.
He's not a senator, he's a phony.
Is that true, master?
In spades, hearts, clubs and diamonds.
Don't be ridiculous.
Well, of course it's ridiculous.
Now, gentlemen, if there's still any doubt, here's my identification.
That's just a A joke.
Here it is!
All right, stand back.
My men are closing in on the rest of them right now.
Good.
Carry on.
Thank you.
I still don't understand how you got all those good cards, major.
Yeah, well, you see, sir, I had to I had to I had to win for the gang.
I know that, major, but it still doesn't explain how you got all those royal flushes.
It was like magic.
No, no, not Not Not like magic, sir.
It was that card shark.
He was dealing the cards to Roger.
Oh.
Yeah, that's right.
That sounds good.
Yeah.
Well, now, that's that.
Uh Uh, let's sit down and have a few friendly hands of poker, just to show there are no hard feelings.
Uh, penny ante.
You better blink out the magic chair.
Blink?
The magic chair.
Blink it out.
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Oh, uh, hi, did you lose something?
Yeah.
Sure did.
Let me give you a hand.
What are we looking for anyway?
Well, that's That's darn neighborly of you.
It's my dad blamed ring.
Your ring, huh?
Yeah.
Uh, I looked in the buggy here and, uh The buggy?
Yeah.
My car here.
But, uh, I reckon I dropped it out here someplace.
Hey, wait a minute.
Yeah.
Don't I recognize you from someplace?
Well, I work here at NASA.
You probably saw me around here.
Oh, well, I got some kinfolk working here at NASA.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, what do you know?
What?
Wait a minute.
What?
That reflection right there.
Wait a minute.
There it is.
Why, there it is.
Ha-ha.
How about that, huh?
Ain't that a beauty?
Yeah.
That's a pretty ring, all right.
That is the only square sapphire east of the Mississippi.
Square sapphire?
Mm-hm.
But it don't go on my finger right.
Oh.
See what I mean?
Too bad.
I'm glad you found it anyway.
Well, I-I'll tell you what.
Well, I certainly do declare.
Lovely lifeline.
Let me try something here.
What are you doing?
I'm trying it on your finger, see if it fits.
Wait a minute.
Now Now, is that the way it should look?
Yeah.
That That does look kind of nice.
Since you're one of our boys in uniform, you give me 35 and we'll call it square.
Thirty-five dollars?
Mm-hm.
Thirty-five dollars.
Yeah, $35.
Here you are.
I thank you.
Keep up the good work, lieutenant.
I'll see you soon.
Thirty-five hundred dollar ring, huh?
Oh.
Oh, this time I did it.
Oh-ho-ho.
Ooh-hoo, Major Healey, hello.
Hi, Jeannie.
Uh, how do you like my new ring, huh?
Oh.
Well, I-it is beautiful.
Heh.
I, uh, have never seen one quite like it.
Yeah.
Well, it's a square sapphire.
It's the only one east of the Mississippi.
W-what?
Uh, w-wear it in good health.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Nice talking to you.
Mm-hm.
Bye-bye.
Heh.
Excuse me, sir.
May I assist you?
Well, heh Well, that's right neighborly of you, ma'am.
It's just my goll dang diamond cuff link.
Heh.
Ooh, a diamond cuff link.
It must be quite valuable.
Yes.
And  Jeannie Nelson?
Excuse me, ma'am, but are you any relation to Major Anthony Nelson?
Oh, no.
No.
He is my husband.
Your husband.
Well, I'll be horsewhipped.
I I'm Arvel, his cousin.
Square sapphire?
Yeah.
But it's the only one east of the Mississippi.
Remember that.
Does it have a magic decoder?
Ah, don't be funny.
This is a very expensive ring.
You know, for secret messages from Dick Tracy and all that?
You kidding?
Know how much I paid for it?
How much?
It's a $3500 ring.
You know how much I paid for it?
I paid $35.
That's clever.
You're lucky the guy wasn't selling the Brooklyn Bridge.
Course my partners, being shrewd businessmen, won't let anybody else in.
But I said to them, I 'told 'em, I said: "Friends, if a man can't let his own flesh and blood "share in his good fortune, why he just ain't much of a man".
Well, that is very generous of you, Cousin Arvel.
Well, I did what I could.
But you know something, Jeannie, as much as I fought them, they wouldn't let me take in more than $1000.
One thousand dollars.
Well, it's not much, heh, but it's the best I could do.
But, Jeannie, it won't always be $1000.
No.
It'll be a-building and a-building.
And some day, why when When Cousin Tony won't be as young as he is, he'll be too old to fly them moon rockets, and all he'll have is that pension to look forward to, why there it'll be, the greatest gift of them all.
Gift?
W-what kind of gift?
Financial security.
Oh.
Financial security?
Mm-hm.
Do you really think Anthony would like that?
Jeannie, Jeannie.
Heh-heh.
Why does a heifer like salt, hm?
Jeannie, when a man has security, why he's like a rattler a-sunnin' hisself on a flat rock, not a care in the world.
Then I shall buy it for him.
Hm-hm.
Yes.
He'd be like a Hm?
I will not be but a moment.
Please do not go away.
Heh.
Well, Cousin Tony not only married purty, he married rich.
Hm-hm.
Now, there's two possibilities: Either she's really loaded or she's plumb loco.
And if she's loco  Heh.
Here you are, Cousin Arvel.
I hope you do not mind gold.
I-if you do, I I can get you bills.
Oh, I have some more.
One moment please.
She's rich, and she's loco.
Gentleman, would you bring those over here so we can compare them.
Here we go.
Excuse me.
Oh, major, that's a very interesting ring.
Thank you, sir.
Actually, that's a genuine It is interesting.
I haven't seen one like it since I used to get them out of cereal boxes.
Takes you back, doesn't it?
Does it have a magic decoder?
Now, wait a minute.
This happens to be a very expensive ring.
I practically stole this for $35.
Thirty-five dollars?
Y-you paid $35 for that?
Well I'm afraid you've been taken, major.
I couldn't have, sir.
I met this guy in the lot by accident.
It was a NASA lot too.
What happened to our security?
Well, uh, sir, I'm sorry Roger got swindled, but these things happen.
Yeah.
There's a sucker born every minute.
No, you don't understand, gentlemen.
Since the space program has been so much in the public eye, it was only a question of time before con men, swindlers and And phony speculators descended on us.
Oh, general, it's only a worthless ring.
Yeah.
A piece of junk.
Of course, and next comes the phony stock investments, and the influence peddlers, and the promoters trying to get our astronauts to endorse their products.
Right.
We're not allowed to do that, sir.
Exactly, major.
And I don't want to give that a chance to happen.
I want that man caught so that the rest of them will know we're not an easy mark.
Mmm.
Major Healey, we owe you a debt of gratitude for bringing this to our attention.
Well, just doing my job, sir.
Sounds like a snake-oil salesman to me.
I wish he had sold me some snake oil, I could get this ring off my finger.
W-wait a minute.
I think that's his car.
He must be here.
There's somebody in there.
Let's go.
Yeah.
Gotcha!
Now that you've got me, what do you plan to do with me?
Beans.
Beans, Cousin Jeannie.
Beans.
Hm-hm!
Well, they They They smell very good, Cousin Arvel, but B-but you did not have to cook dinner.
Oh, well, I'm not cooking to show off my culinary genius.
I am cooking these beans to show you where your financial security is.
Oh.
Well, I-I I do not understand.
Fried chicken, barbecued spare ribs, fish and chips.
Why, folks have made a fortune out of that stuff.
Well, I got here one of the gone dangest recipes for Texas chili beans that you ever smacked your lips over.
And with your money and my recipe, why, we could make it famous.
Uh, ooh, that is That is what you wanted the money for?
For, uh, beans?
Come now, little lady, don't you worry your pretty head over that.
Now you just leave the cooking and the business to little ol' Arvel here.
Cousin Jeannie Cousin Arvel Oh, excuse me.
Heh.
Ladies first.
Well, uh, p-perhaps it would be a good idea if we did not tell Anthony about this just yet.
I, uh I-I would like to have his financial security be a complete surprise.
You just took the words right out of my mouth.
Oh, good.
Good.
Good.
Ooh, hello, darling.
Hi.
Uh, well, I lit the fire, I got a nice bottle of wine, and if you turn on the music Oh, well, darling, uh, no.
I I'm afraid not.
We We have a guest.
A guest?
Who?
Cousin Tony.
Lock up the silver.
What?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Oh, is this not a pleasant surprise?
Cousin Arvel came all the way from Texas just to visit us.
Terrific.
I told you he'd be tickled.
Ha-ha.
And I will show you what a pleasant guest I can be around the house.
I want you to wrap your lips around some of the best Texas chili north of the Pecos.
Ho-ho.
Uh, Arvel, how long are you gonna be here?
Try this.
Oh How's that, son?
Is it not delicious?
Delicious.
What do you think of it?
"Cousin Tony's Texas Chili".
Oh.
Oh, Cousin Arvel.
Why, that That is most generous of you.
Most generous, but But But it is your recipe.
Jeannie, I just want to show my gratitude.
Come here.
I wanna t-tell you something.
Sit here.
Sit down here.
Now, I have decided that we're not only gonna sell our chili from stands, we're gonna can it.
Ha-ho!
Before I'm through, Cousin Tony's face will be in every supermarket in the country.
Huh?
Oh!
Oh, how exciting.
How long will it take?
Well, with Tony's endorsement, I reckon I could sign up a canner in about half a minute.
His endorsement?
Did you talk to him and ask him?
Why, Jeannie, don't you remember?
Don't you remember he said it was delicious?
Huh?
Oh, yes.
If that ain't an endorsement, I don't know what is.
Right?
Yes.
Oh, by Before I forget.
Now, not a word of this until we can show him a can with his face on it.
Okay?
Oh.
It just goes to show you how wrong you can be about people.
My master's face in every supermarket.
I can hardly wait.
Oh!
Why should I wait?
Whee!
Cocoa Beach Supermarket, NASA cafeteria, Food City.
Aha.
This is the last one.
Let's see.
May I help you find something, ma'am?
Oh!
Oh.
Heh.
Well, yes, as a matter of fact, you can.
Cousin Tony's Texas Chili.
It is delicious.
Cousin Tony's?
I don't think we carry that brand.
Just a moment please.
Oh, well, never mind.
I found it.
Oh, yes, good.
Good.
Peculiar.
It isn't here on Pickles and ketchup.
Uh, and, oh, yes, Alfred loves chili.
Cousin Tony's Texas Chili.
Oh, uh, may I see that for a moment, please?
Oh, oh, yes, yes.
It's a new item.
It's quite delicious.
Cousin Tony.
Oh Oh.
Thank you very much.
Oh, this is wonderful.
This is wonderful.
I put my master's face in all the supermarkets and the NASA cafeteria.
Why, I still have a whole case left over.
Cousin Jeannie.
Cousin Jeannie!
In here, Cousin Arvel!
Yee-hoo!
Ah, we done it.
We done it!
I just left the distributor, and he told me that he would take all the Cousin Tony Texas Chili that we could deliver.
Oh!
Now Now all we gotta do is put that stuff in cans.
Oh.
Oh, well, I-I have already done that.
And And I have even put it in the supermarkets too.
And I thought I was fast.
Cousin Jeannie, you You are a genius.
Oh.
W-what did you charge 'em?
Charge 'em?
Mm-hm.
Do you mean money?
Well, I don't mean rutabagas.
Sure, money.
You You did charge?
Oh.
Heh-heh.
Cousin Jeannie, I I-I wanna tell you something.
You see You see, the only way that we're gonna get financial security for Tony is by selling the chili to the markets, see?
You see, and if we don't get money for the chili, heh, I mean, that ain't selling, you know.
That's, uh Well, that's criminal.
I-I'm terribly sorry, Cousin Arvel, but I did not understand about that part.
All right, now you Now you take me to all those places where you put 'em, and I'll make the deals, huh?
Very well.
Okay.
Cans.
Alfred, is it or isn't it?
It couldn't be.
Oh, Alfred, you just amaze me.
You really do.
I mean, now here is a can that says, "Cousin Tony's Texas Chili" on it.
We have Major Nelson in his cute little astronaut suit smiling at us, and you still say it isn't him?
But Major Nelson knows that astronauts can't endorse products.
He mentioned it himself.
Oh.
Well, that's nice.
Well, I want to mention one thing too.
If he can endorse chili, you can endorse headache pills.
He's given you enough of them.
It's a joke.
It must be somebody's idea of a joke, that's all.
Well, if it is, major, it's in very poor taste.
Mm.
Do you realize what would happen if Schaeffer got a look at this?
Yeah.
We can't have the general looking at that.
No, you don't, major.
This is evidence.
You're not gonna show that to him without giving me a chance to track down who's responsible for it, are you?
Of course not, major.
But I'm going to keep it until you do.
Huh?
I'm just going to lunch.
Anyone care to join me?
I'd love to, sir, but I'm I'm very busy right now.
Uh, yes.
He's very busy.
We'd be delighted to join you for lunch.
In your purse.
My purse?
In my purse?
Oh, well, he's speaking to me.
I think it's a good idea.
Why don't we go to the cafeteria right now.
It gets so busy this time of day.
Why don't you try the chili.
It's great.
Chili?
Yes, it's called Cousin Tony's Texas Chi Oh, Alfred, this is ridiculous.
I have to tell him.
I was shopping in the food mart today, and I found this can with Major Nelson's picture Are you people going to lunch with me or not?
Yes, I'm going to lunch wi Y-yes.
I'm going to lunch.
I'm suddenly very hungry for chili.
Well, I I think I'll have seconds, gang.
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Shh!
I know a shortcut to the cafeteria.
Wait a minute!
Wait a minute.
I'm not that hungry.
Are you all right?
No, I'm not all right.
Wait a minute.
What do you wanna do?
I don't want seconds.
Wait.
We're on the second floor.
Oh!
You're an astronaut.
Did you get all of 'em?
Yeah, I got all of 'em.
Why couldn't we eat in the cafeteria?
It's only 30 cents a bowl and a big bowl.
Because my picture is on the front of it, that's why.
Hey, that does look like you.
Yeah.
Jeannie, Jeannie, I'm home.
Oh, and forget about lunch.
We brought it.
Huh?
Jeannie!
Jeannie.
Wait a minute.
What's this?
Tony.
Huh?
Wait a minute.
I brought two boxes, you brought a box.
Where'd this come from?
What?
Oh, that does look like you.
Let me see.
What's the matter?
Jeannie.
Jeannie.
What?
I-I knew she had something to do with this.
And I bet you Cousin Arvel had something to do with it too.
Yeah.
Who's Cousin Arvel?
Cousin Arvel?
Oh, he's the guy that sold you this square sapphire.
The guy that sold me this?
Your cousin sold me the ring?
Yes.
Uh, t-twice removed.
Twice removed?
H-here's the list of the Where they sold the chili.
NASA cafeteria, Food City.
We gotta get that stuff off the shelf, man.
If that's your cousin, I want my $35 back.
Yes, I have some right over here.
I put it right down Oh.
Ha-ha.
This young lady is purchasing some right now.
Miss!
Don't buy that.
You won't like it.
It's poison.
This stuff is just awful.
Really?
Removing it from the market.
Here, have some of that.
It's really a lot better.
Thank you for the tip.
This stuff is bleh!
How dare you badmouth our food?
That happens to be one of our newest items, and I just made a deal with a manufacturer who assures me that it's the finest chili on the market.
Great.
I'll take it.
I'll take it all.
Here.
Hold that.
I'll take all you got, huh?
You'll love it.
You'll come back for more.
All right.
Uh, just check me out.
Miss.
Hi, miss.
Uh I happen to be the representative, uh, for Cousin Tony's Texas Chili.
And, uh, these, uh, labels happen to be very defective.
So we have to get these labels.
They go back to the company.
Now, this one here I noticed Do you shop here very often?
You're a very nice lady.
And you have very, very lovely hair.
Now, isn't that prettier?
That's very, very nice.
Very good chili.
Well, it certainly has been nice talking to you.
Have a nice shopping day.
Bye.
Ahem.
Good chili.
Very good.
Got everything?
Oh, Major Nelson, I Amanda, what on earth?
You can't go through Major Nelson's desk!
Alfred, I am tired of being made a fool of.
Now, I know he switched those cans on me.
I know it.
I'm going to find the can, show it to the general to prove to him I'm not crazy.
But, Amanda, you promised the major.
Besides, they said they didn't have any in the cafeteria.
They didn't say they didn't have any.
They said they were out of it.
And there's a big difference.
Aha.
I told you.
There it is, right here.
Amanda, you're making a mistake.
Now, let me tell you Sergeant, you owe us for one case of Cousin Tony's Texas Chili.
Here you are.
I'll say it again.
I don't know where it came from in the first place, and I don't know where it went, but I ain't about to pay you for any chili that don't exist.
Oh.
It is a mystery, but luckily there is one case left.
Oh, look, sergeant, you must've missed it.
That's the craziest thing I've ever seen.
Sergeant, this is General Schaeffer.
Sergeant, this may sound like an odd question, but do you have any Cousin Tony's Texas Chili in the cafeteria?
What?
You do?
Sergeant, bring the case to my office.
And the man and woman too.
Well, if this is true, Major Nelson is finished.
Yeah, well, at least we got 'em off the shelf.
When I find Jeannie, I'll get her to blink the labels off the cans that people already bought.
Oh, Major Nelson.
Inside, please.
You have some explaining to do.
I was just Inside, major!
You too, Major Healey.
Hi, darling.
How are you?
Ooh.
Sorry, sir.
Sorry.
I am astounded, major, particularly after yesterday's conversation.
Sir, if you just give me a chance to explain, I'm sure I can clear this all up.
Well, general, the major did say it was some sort of a joke.
A can of chili is a joke, doctor.
A case is a court-martial.
Bring it here, sergeant.
A court-martial.
I do not understand.
What about this ring, Arvel?
Shh.
How about the Hong Kong flu?
Hm?
Hm?
Open it up.
They'll be able to see one if you don't blink the can out.
Oh, but, master, they have your picture on Now.
Yes, master.
What is that?
!
That is the best Texas chili north of the Pecos.
Here you are, darling.
Oh, thanks, sweetheart.
Hey, this is not that, uh That stuff Arvel It is.
Yes, it is.
It is chili.
But after all, we have so much of it, it is a shame to waste it.
It is perfectly good vitamins.
Shame to waste it.
Hi, everybody.
Hello, Major Healey.
Sorry.
Didn't know it was dinner.
Have a little chili.
Oh, sit down.
No, I'm up to here in chili.
I'll have some crackers though.
Oh, you ever get that 35 bucks back from Arvel?
Oh, better than that, he, uh, let me keep the ring, and for $35 more, he gave me this water opal and threw in the rhinestone cuff links.
Ooh, very nice.
Let me see that ring again.
Yeah.
MAN : Calling all cars, calling all cars.
Be on the lookout for a green and white sedan heading south on Boulevard A. That's for me.
I gotta go.
Wait.
Let me see this.
I haven't seen one of these in 30 years.
