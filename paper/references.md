## Data collection
I took inspiration from a variety of places and methodologies. There isn't one "best" way to approach this problem, so I aimed to maximize utility and efficacy over a broad set of data in order to be able to effectively answer my research question with respect to a long enough span of time. Below, I've listed a few of the projects I came across that helped me figure out my approach.
1. [Futurama Transcripts | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/josephvm/futurama-seasons-16-transcripts)
2. [How to create TV Sitcom Dataset from raw web transcripts?](https://towardsdatascience.com/now-we-have-tv-sitcom-f-r-i-e-n-d-s-dataset-created-from-web-transcripts-908af7777977)

Also helpful were guides to web scraping with BeautifulSoup. This is my first time scraping HTML pages (I used Reddit's API to gather post data for my Bubbles hackathon project), so it was a bit of a challenge. This is just a small sampling of the websites I stumbled across in search of some answers.
