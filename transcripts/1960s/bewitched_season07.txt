{START OF EPISODE 01}
Darrin.
You're pacing.
What?
You know, "to-ing" and "fro-ing," and "to-ing" and "fro-ing".
I wasn't even aware of it.
Mm, I guess it's because I feel a little guilty about dropping the whole Barrows Umbrella account in Larry's lap.
Sweetheart, we are in Salem on a vacation.
Sort of.
Now, we planned to take a nice drive up the coast to Gloucester and have some lobster and-- And that's probably Larry.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll get rid of him.
Oh.
Hi, Larry.
Hey.
How'd you know it was me?
A wild guess.
I bet you can't guess why I'm calling.
It's about the Barrows Umbrella account, and you want me to-- Wrong.
I'm calling because I got an idea how you can have a vacation with pay.
I thought that's what I had.
Oh, you do.
You do.
What I was referring to is a little extra bonus.
And to get it, all you have to do is come down here to Boston and help me cinch the Barrows account.
I thought you said you weren't calling about the Barrows account.
Oh, I'm not.
I'm calling about your bonus.
Forget it, Larry.
Now, you have my rough layouts and-- Oh, yes, and they're fine.
They're fine.
Good.
Then you can cinch the Barrows account on your own.
I must say, you're not showing much appreciation to someone who merely called to offer you a bonus.
Not interested, Larry.
And good luck with Barrows.
Bye.
Ingrate!
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Too bad?
Y-yes.
I've been called to an emergency meeting of the Witches' Council.
Terrific.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but Mother's giving a special demonstration of incantations past, present and future.
Uh, maybe you could call him back.
Before I'd call him back, I'd go sightseeing alone.
Why alone, when Serena's ready, willing and able?
Hi, little cousin.
Hi there, tall, dark and mortal.
If you don't mind, Serena, you're one sight I'd rather not see.
Oh.
The charm-school dropout is in rare form today.
Ha-ha!
Serena, the hotel doesn't allow pets or helicopters in the room, so would you mind getting rid of it?
That can be arranged.
And when you get rid of it, be sure you're in it.
Oh, that's cute.
Darrin, there's no reason to be rude.
I'm sorry I was a few days late for the convention, Sammy, but I got involved in the world kite-flying championships in India.
Uh, guess what.
What?
I was disqualified.
Disqualified?
On a mere technicality.
Instead of flying it, I towed it.
Oh, that's a shame.
I wouldn't have disqualified you.
You wouldn't?
Of course not.
The longer you're in the air, the more chance you have of hitting a tree.
Ohh.
Sweetheart, i-in the best interest of keeping peace in the family, why don't you reconsider and go sightseeing with Serena?
I have to go to the meeting anyway.
Two's company, except when she's one of the two.
I could meet you at the Gloucester House for lunch.
Absolutely under no circumstances will I go anyplace with her.
Oh!
He's such a darling.
And since the invitation comes straight from the heart, I accept.
Mwah.
Good.
I'll meet you there about noon.
I think I missed something somewhere.
Get in.
I will, just as soon as I get over the shock.
I was expecting a broom.
My broom is getting a lube job.
This is a loaner.
Ah!
I'll drive.
Okay, poopsie.
I like it.
I like it.
It's certainly the work of a talented man.
Well, then, shall we get down to the business of, uh, contracts, et cetera?
But it misses.
It just misses.
Well, I'm sure Stephens will have no trouble putting it on target.
And I guarantee we'll shoot the sales of Barrows Umbrellas far beyond your expectations.
I expect everybody in the world to own a Barrows umbrella.
Stop the car!
Stop the car.
What is that?
It's just a statue.
Well that statue is a sight, and we are sightseeing.
"They that go down to the sea in ships".
Who is this cat, anyway?
Don't you know anything?
This is the famous Fisherman's Memorial.
Oh.
And what a knockout of a memorial he is.
Just dig that weather-beaten face and those powerful arms.
Ah!
What a ball to be steered by him.
Well, Serena, this is the closest you're going to get to this "cat," unless you turn yourself into a seagull.
Dum-dum, I wouldn't bet my plantation on that if I were you.
Pride of Gloucester Sentinel of the sea I deem you come alive And swagger down to me Still think he's for the birds?
Avast, ye hearties.
What the devil's going on here?
You might call it fun and games.
Well, I call it insanity.
Serena, put this statue back, or-- Oh!
He is not a statue.
He is flesh and blood.
Here, touch him.
Touch me person, and I'll thrash you within an inch of your life.
You can touch me.
But himno.
Serena, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Put this statue back, or I-- Here.
What a wench.
It's been 50 years since I've kissed a lassie.
Oh!
Whoopee!
You know something?
They're better when they're aged.
Serena, I'm finished with you.
Well, I'm not.
Goody.
Serena.
If there isn't a statue holding on to that wheel by the time I count to three, there's going to be trouble.
Dum-dum you are absolutely right.
Start counting.
One, two-- Don't forget, it was your idea.
Shiver me timbers.
What's that?
Oh, that is a car.
It's used for transportation and air polluting.
Listen, me ancient mariner, uh, why don't we split to someplace more romantic, so you can catch up on all you've been missing these last few years?
"Split"?
Uh, leave, embark, set sail.
I'll have none of it if I have to sail there.
Well, "set sail" is just an expression.
Besides, what have you got against water?
Nothing.
It just scares me out of my wits.
Well, that's ridiculous.
You're an able-bodied seaman.
You forget, I stand for all those able-bodied seamen that drowned.
Okay.
Heave to and we'll fly there.
The only water you'll see is the kind you pour over your Scotch.
They call this paradise?
I haven't named it yet.
It's just a little something I whipped up to make myself comfortable in Salem.
Come, come.
Sayuh, how about sitting down and-- And resting those strong, magnificent sea legs of yours?
Let's not get too close to the water, please.
Who's that?
Oh, it's just an ex-friend of mine.
He got stoned one night, so I left him that way.
Oh.
What's the matter, sweetie?
Me back, lassie.
Me back.
I've been standing over that wheel for almost 50 years.
Me back is killing me.
Oh, dear.
Well, uh, here.
Now let me rub it for you.
How's that?
Oh.
Lower, lassie.
Lower.
Gladly.
Oh!
You are gorgeous.
Oh, my.
Ooh!
Darrin.
I-is that you in there?
Oh, sweetheart.
I don't know what to say except I have a cousin who makes Lucrezia Borgia look like Shirley Temple.
But don't you worry.
I'll figure out a way to get you out of there.
The hotel clerk said they're having lunch at the Gloucester House.
I'm sure we'll find him there.
I hope so, Mr. Tate.
Oh, as a matter of fact, there's Mrs. Stephens now.
Where?
I'll say one thing, though: If you have to be a statue, this is a nice place to be one.
Over there, talking to that statue.
Huh?
I mean, over there by that statue.
Oh.
Darrin's probably around someplace.
Come on, I wanna introduce you.
Sam!
Hi, Sam.
Heh-heh.
Ha-ha.
Am I glad I found you.
Oh, well, hi, Larry.
W-w-what are you doing in Gloucester?
Hopefully, having lunch with you and Darrin.
Oh, Mr. Barrows, this is Mrs. Stephens.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, Mr. Barrows is head of Barrows Umbrellas, and he's just dying to hear some of Darrin's new ideas.
That's nice.
Where is he?
Who?
Darrin.
Oh!
He's hanging around here somewhere.
Mrs. Stephens, Tate here speaks very highly of your husband.
He's got him on some kind of pedestal.
Oh.
Well, that's nice.
Darrin's very comfortable o-on a pedestal.
Yes, sir.
Ha.
Well, Sam.
Let's go find him, and we can go on to lunch together.
Oh, oh.
Let's not bother with Darrin.
Uh, let's just go to lunch, just the three of us.
The three of us?
Oh, it'll be fun.
Sam, are you all right?
No.
I mean-- Um, well-- I get a little lightheaded when I'm hungry.
And I am just dying for one of those lobsters.
Larry.
Come on, Larry.
Come on.
You know, it's funny, I've never seen this statue before, but it looks very familiar to me.
Wait.
This is the Fisherman's Memorial.
It's dedicated to the more than 10,000 fishermen who lost their lives at sea.
Come to think of it, he looks more defiant and ferocious than I remember him.
Oh, he looks ferocious, all right.
Sam.
Is that all you can see?
Huh?
You know, it's amazing.
The face of this statue looks a-- A great deal like Stephens.
Sam, can't you see the resemblance?
No.
Not really.
I mean, examine the chin.
That is not Darrin's strong chin.
Yeah.
His chin is kind of weak.
Very.
Well, now that we decided the statue doesn't look like Mr. Stephens, suppose we take Mrs. Stephens to lunch?
Uh, uh-- Why don't you two go on without me?
But you just said you were starving.
Yes, I did, didn't I?
Hm.
Well, um, why don't you two go to the Gloucester House, and I'll wait here for Darrin?
But we don't wanna take a chance on missing Darrin.
Why don't we all wait here?
O-oh, uh, Larry, uh, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Why not?
Yeah, why not?
Because I suddenly remembered that Darrin said he was going to take a walk, and he wanted me to meet him at the Gloucester House.
You suddenly remembered?
Yes.
I-I told you I get a little lightheaded when I get hungry.
Especially for lobster.
All right, Tate, let's go.
All this talk about lobster is making me hungry.
May I help you?
Uh, we're looking for Mr. Darrin Stephens.
Uh, we have a reservation for Mr. Stephens, but I don't believe he's arrived yet.
Well, that's strange.
I wonder what's holding him up.
I hate to think.
Larry, w-why don't you and Mr. Barrows go to the table?
I'll join you in a moment.
Right this way.
Mr. Barrows.
Bartender.
Set them up for everybody.
I'm buying.
And forget the little lady who was just here.
She must be a "toteetaler".
A teetotaler.
To-- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I got back as soon as I could.
Trust me.
I will find Serena and get you out of there.
In the meantime, keep a stiff upper lip.
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Stars and planets And things in the know Whisk me to where Romance can grow Excuse me but I'm looking for two people whom I thought might be here.
One is-- Oh, you mean, uh, that pretty girl and that nutty-looking sailor?
They're the ones.
Not that I watched, mind you, because it was none of my business, but they was holding hands, and kissing and whispering to each other.
Y-you wanna know what they was whispering?
Uh, no, thank you.
Um, I just wanna know where they went.
Well, I, uh-- I turned back to my clipping, like this And when I turned back, like thisthey was-- Gone.
Just like you.
When John Paul Potter III drinks, everybody drinks.
Another round for the folks.
Wellthe little "toteetaler" is back.
How about a little nip, sweetie?
Oh, well, thanks, uh, but I think you are doing just fine for both of us.
Cheers.
Whoa-ho Blow the man down Gimme some fellows To follow the sea Gimme some time To blow the man down Blow the man down Please blow the man down Whoa, oh!
Blow the man down Young man.
Will you shut up for a moment?
You watch your tongue, landlubber.
I'll have you swinging from the yardarm.
Now, you listen to me.
We're in a restaurant with a young lady.
Now, if I checked my umbrella, I see no reason why you can't check your hat.
You won't take my hat.
Ah.
There you are.
Sam, look who we ran into: Serena and herboyfriend.
I can't imagine what's keeping Darrin.
No offense, Mrs. Stephens, but I'll give him five more minutes, and then I leave.
And with me, Tate, goes my account.
Serena, I think you and I should have a few words together.
Excuse me, my little chicken of the sea.
Oh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Chicken of the sea.
That's me.
Serena, I don't wanna know how, and I don't wanna know why.
I just want a fair exchange: Darrin for your seaman.
Well, okay, coz, but believe me that is not a fair exchange.
Are you sure you ladies wouldn't like a little drinky-poo?
Potter's springing.
So is Serena.
I think the party's over.
So long, dumbo.
Sam, what's happening?
Shh, shh.
Blow the man down Will we blow the man down Whoa, oh I hate to interrupt your good time, but if the Pirate of Penzance isn't out of here immediately, Barrows Umbrellas will be.
Where did he go?
He was, uh, shanghaied.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, Tate, let's get my hat and umbrella, and go.
But, Mr. Barrows-- Gentlemen, look who I found waiting outside.
Darrin.
Thank heaven.
Larry.
Uh, Mr. Barrows, this is Darrin Stephens.
Hello, Stephens.
Oh, Mr. Barrows.
Uh, Darrin, I've just been telling Mr. Barrows that the only reason you're at Salem is to work on some ideas for Barrows Umbrellas.
Mr. Stephens I've had a very difficult and strange day.
I no longer have any interest in any of your ideas.
Uh, Mr. Barrows, i-if you don't want to listen to Darrin, uh, would you listen to me?
Mrs. Stephens, I'm a businessman most of the time but I'm a gentleman all the time.
Please sit down.
Oh, thank you.
Nowtell me about it.
Well Darrin's idea is to use the Fisherman's Memorial as a symbol for Barrows Umbrellas.
That's why we were there.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Barrows, what percentage of umbrellas are bought by women?
About 80 percent.
Aha.
The men don't seem to wanna buy 'em, right?
Well, you see, Darrin's idea is to make the umbrella more attractive to men by associating it with a-- A masculine symbol: the Fisherman's Memorial.
Hmm.
Mr. Barrows, I'm sure if you hear Darrin present his idea, it'll be more impressive.
I like that idea.
But I doubt it.
You know, Samantha explained it so beautifully.
Tell us the rest of it, young man.
Uh, picture this: The helmsman, standing in the face of a fierce storm, one hand on the wheel, the other holding a Barrows umbrella.
I love it.
"Even the men who go down to the sea in ships carry Barrows umbrellas".
Stephensit's sensational.
Sensational.
You were well worth waiting for.
I told you he would be.
You son of a gun.
But I'd still like to know where you've been all this time.
W-well, Darrin was just staring out to the sea, thinking.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?
Yeah.
Heh-heh.
That's right.
Well, let's everybody have a drink.
Oh, great idea.
Waitress.
Waitress.
Doubles.
You know, sweetheart, that's a great idea.
"Even men that go down to the sea in ships carry Barrows umbrellas".
I've got an idea for another slogan: "Not even a nor'easter can blow out a Barrows umbrella".
Hi.
Speaking of ill winds Watch it, ding-dong.
I just popped in to give you the opportunity of thanking me.
For what?
Well, you landed the dumb account, didn't you?
I'll thank you to blow outta here.
Ta-ta.
Darrin you know something?
I think I liked your first slogan better.
Oh, boy.
adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
There.
How's that?
Tighter.
Darrin.
If I tied it any tighter, you'd pass out.
I wanna pass out.
It's the merciful thing to do.
I just resent having to wear a dinner jacket to eat dinner in my own house, just to please a so-called empress.
If it'll make you feel any better, she won't be pleased.
She'd rather you wear tails.
And she is an empress and high priestess of all witches and warlocks.
That still doesn't give her the right to barge into our house and turn it into Buckingham Palace.
Well, she'll change it back when she leaves.
Sweetheart, try to understand.
Uh, redecorating makes her feel more at home.
Where does she live?
The Taj Mahal?
Boy, some nerve.
"I, Hepzibah, will reside in this house for one week, "to decide whether or not "this first and only mixed marriage of witch to mortal should be dissolved".
Blech.
Sam is this all worth it?
I mean, wouldn't it be easier if we agreed you'd go to the witches' convention by yourself?
Wouldn't that satisfy her?
It would not satisfy me.
If I have to go to Salem to that dumb witches' convention, I want you to come with me.
Mommy?
Where did you get that outfit?
Her Majesty.
She said a young lady should dress properly for dinner.
And a fairy princess never looked lovelier.
What did she dress Adam as?
Prince Charming?
so he's not allowed to come down at all.
Darn.
I wish I had thought of that.
Well, first call for dinner.
Ex-queen Samantha, her daughter Tabitha, and mortal.
Well, come, come.
Din-din is getting cold.
Who are they?
Our servants, of course.
We never travel anywhere without our servants.
Well, you can tell your "trumpeteer" that I have a name and a title: Darrin Stephens, master of this house.
Not while we live here.
And for not remembering your place, you get one demerit.
Young man when those other nine demerits are over with that other demerit, you will be dissolved.
Uh, come on, sweetheart.
Our, uh, din-din is getting cold.
"Dissolved"?
Shh.
Everything looks yummy.
Oh, it looks different.
Hm.
What is it?
Oh, pâté of elephant tail, pickled eye of newt.
Over there is hummingbird tongue parmigiana.
And here is kidney of iguana bourguignonne in neat-feet oil.
Well, to be perfectly honest, uh, Your Highness, these, ahem, goodies are a little exotic for my system.
Ridiculous.
Pâté of elephant tail is no more exotic than blueberry pie.
Uh, Darrin's not too crazy about blueberry pie either.
This is ethnic food.
By refusing to share it with us, you are insulting an entire ethnic group.
What do you say to that?
How about the eight ball in the side pocket?
Another demerit for that feeble attempt at humor.
Well, that's three down, seven to go.
Answer the door.
Well, i-it's no one we know, uh, Your Majesty.
I-I mean, a friend would never just drop in at the dinner hour, uninvited.
And a friend who would drop in at the dinner hour isn't much of a friend.
Sowho needs him?
We do.
If we are researching the species, we would like to meet as many mortals as possible.
Hi, Sam.
I'm sorry to barge in at dinnertime but I had to drop these papers off for Darrin.
And I'd like to-- You're having a costume party and you didn't invite me.
Oh!
Uh, no, no, Larry.
Uh, we're just entertaining an aunt of mine who insists we dress up.
Excuse me.
When, uh, did you redecorate?
Redecorate?
We didn't.
It's my aunt's.
She's very, very wealthy, and, uh a little strange.
A lot strange.
A ding-a-ling?
Samantha uh, bring whoever it is into our presence.
I'd better go.
I'll call you later, Darrin.
No, no.
Larry, please.
Uh, just-- Just meet her.
Your Majesty, may I present my business associate, Mr. Tate?
Do I curtsy?
A bow will do.
Nicely done.
We are pleased with this one.
Thank you, Your Highness.
I'm available for knighthood.
Eh, he's a bit of a ding-a-ling.
Heh.
Uh, Darrin, I'm sorry to barge in on this little dinner party of yours, but I had to talk to you before we meet with Hitchcock in the morning.
Oh.
Sit down and join us.
Oh, I-- I'd be honored, but, uh, actually, I'm joining my wife at the club for dinner.
Oh, and you know how Louise hates to be kept waiting.
So why don't you just run along?
But, uh, I, heh, could have an hors d'oeuvre or two.
Postlethwaite.
It certainly looks delicious.
Don't bother, Postlethwaite.
I'm full.
As you were.
Thank you.
Mm.
Mmm.
Mmm.
It is delicious.
I mean, really delicious.
I never tasted anything like it.
What is it?
It's a secret family recipe.
So, uh-- Uh, Hitchcock is coming to the office tomorrow, right?
Mm.
I can taste the parmigiana, but I can't make out-- The hummingbird tongue?
The what?
That's very amusing, Your Highness.
Oh, funny, huh?
We have heard of hummingbird tongue being tasty, but never amusing.
Tabitha, are you enjoying your hummingbird tongue?
I like the pickled eye of newt better.
The pickled-- Eye of newt.
Uh, listen I hate to eat and run, but, uh-- Run, run.
Heh.
Louise is waiting.
Oh, I'll see you in the morning.
It's been an honor meeting you, Your Highness.
And, uh, don't get up.
I think I can find my way out.
At least the creature was man enough to give it a try.
I don't know how much longer I can take it.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Just a few more days, and it'll all be over.
Wellthe way I'm piling up demerits, it could be all over today.
I'd better get along.
Where?
To work.
That interests us.
What is "work"?
That's a very good question, Your Majesty.
And Samantha is just the person to explain it.
See you later, honey.
Uh, by your leave.
What is "work"?
Oh, that's what mortals do from 9 to 5.
You will explain while we have our breakfast.
Quickly, Penelope.
Naughty, naughty.
Once over lightly.
Repeat.
What is "work"?
Well, in Darrin's case, it's advertising.
What is advertising?
Advertising is-- Well After breakfast, you will take us to his workshop.
Oh, uh but I-I couldn't take us there.
I-I mean, he's very busy.
If we have time to watch him, then he will make time to be watched.
But I couldn't possibly leave the house.
I don't have a babysitter.
You do now.
Y-- Yes, uh, Your Majesty.
Morning.
It's almost noon.
I know.
I had a great night's sleep.
One hour, from Did I eat hummingbird tongue last night, or didn't I?
Larry, will you please forget last night?
Uh, Hitchcock will be here any minute.
Now, let's go over the presentation.
What's pickled eye of newt?
Uh, it's kind of a squash prepared with a sauce.
It is?
Because I love squash.
Hello.
Uh, we didn't have a chance to call.
Uh, Aunt Hepzibah wanted to come and see where you work.
Carry on.
L-look, uh-- Uh, Your Majesty, we're really very busy.
Good.
Then we shall observe "busyness".
Sam, would you please try to explain to Her Highness that we're expecting a very important client?
Larry said they're expecting-- We do not need a translation.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes?
Hitchcock is here.
Tell him to wait.
Send him in.
I've got a great idea, Your Majesty.
Why don't you visit the United Nations?
You can meet a lot of kings and presidents.
Send him in.
Send him in.
Uh, look, Your Majesty uh, Mr. Hitchcock is a very busy man, an-and busy men are sometimes very brusque and impatient.
He might say something to insult you.
We hope not, for his sake.
Oh.
Good to see you, Mr. Hitchcock.
Uh, Tate.
Mr. Hitchcock.
Stephens.
Oh, uh, may I present my wife, Samantha?
How do you do?
And her Aunt Hepzibah visiting from out of town.
Ladies.
I've got exactly before we go to lunch, Stephens.
Shall we get on with it?
Yes, let's get on with it.
I-in the conference room.
Uh, that won't be necessary.
We are very comfortable here.
Is this some sort of a joke, Tate?
Heh-heh.
Well, uh-- Ha.
Well, my aunt i-- Was rather interested in studying the world of business.
Perhaps it's not my place to say this, madam, but, uh-- You're a most attractive woman.
And I cannot imagine you being interested in anything as dull as business.
How very gallant, Mr. Hitchcock.
Ernest, please.
I beg you.
Well, shall we get started, Mr. Hitchcock?
Uh, there are ladies present, Tate.
Let's chat a while, hm?
Hepzibah.
Hepzibah.
What a lovely name.
Biblical?
Hardly.
So you're from out of town.
Where, may I ask, my dear?
Oh!
She's lived all over.
Yes.
Uh, Mr. Hitchcock, if-- If you'll take a look at the pre-- Presentation-- As soon as I can take my eyes off this lovely and incredibly beautiful creature.
So you're a world traveler.
Perhaps you've used my airlines.
The regal bird with the silver beak?
We are pleased with this man.
He has quality.
Uh, the feeling is mutual.
Perhaps we can discuss it at lunch.
Delighted.
The thing is, I only made a reservation at Pavillon for you and Darrin.
They're booked solid.
How fortunate for us, Hepzibah.
We shall dine alone then.
Oh!
Come along.
We'll see you after lunch.
Your Majesty.
Have you ever been to Crete?
Not for centuries.
What--?
What--?
What happened?
How could you do it, Sam?
How could you do it?
We-- Well, I-I didn't have any choice.
I mean, if Mr. Hitchcock had said one rude word to Hepzibah-- and he was about to --why, she would've zapped him into an aardvark or something.
But I wouldn't have minded your turning him into Mr. Nice Guy, but a lovesick adolescent is overdoing it.
I didn't have time for subtleties.
Rowr!
We are home.
We are pleased to say we have come to the conclusion that as a lower form of life, some mortals are not without charm.
Sweetheart.
Had you but an ounce of Ernest's exquisite taste, you might be barely tolerable.
Well, if we're playing the truth game, let me tell you something.
For raising your voice to us another demerit.
Another demerit.
Another demerit.
I might as well go for the jackpot.
I want you out of my house.
And your puppy dogs and your servants.
Out.
You may be the almighty of all witches, but to me, you're an almighty pain in the-- Darrin!
Uh, he-he-he-- He apo-- Apologizes, Your Majesty.
Apologize.
It is too late for you to apologize.
You have used up your demerits and our patience.
The marriage will be dissolved at midnight.
But-- But-- Go to your room.
"The marriage will be dissolved at midnight".
Boy, some nerve.
I mean, how could she dissolve our marriage?
How?
I'd just like to know how.
She could turn you into an ex-husband.
How?
I'd just like to know how.
By dissolving you.
Now I know how.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll just talk her into drumming me out of the witch world.
Uh, what does that mean?
Well, how should I know?
Uh, she'll probably recite some mumbo jumbo and zap, I'll be just plain folks.
Then it's none of her business what I do.
And?
Well, I don't know.
It's never been done before.
I-- I suppose I'd lose my powers.
Sam, I won't let you do it.
Isn't that what you've always wanted?
Yes.
No.
I meanI love you for what you are.
Well, I'd still be what I am.
I-- I just wouldn't have my powers.
But that's a part of you.
And I won't let you give it up.
I won't let anything or anybody change you or dissolve our marriage.
Including the High Priestess Hepzibah.
And I'll get down on my knees if I have to, but I won't stop until she accepts my apology.
Come on.
Ernest.
You are so amusing.
Mr. Hitchcock.
This is a private audience.
Oh.
Please, forgive me for dropping in unannounced, but I didn't want to lose touch with this lovely lady.
And she's going away, and she won't tell me where she's going.
Isn't it sweet?
She'll be leaving for Salem in a few days.
Samantha.
Ah.
Salem is beautiful this time of the year.
Ernest, we are touched by your devotion but, really, we will have so little time to give you.
I'll be staying at the Hawthorne Hotel.
And you?
We will be Calling you when we are free.
Good night, beautiful creature.
Good night.
Goodbye.
Mr. Hitchcock.
Bye.
Mortals can sometimes be endearing.
They can grow on one.
Perhaps we have been too rash.
Perhaps we should study the species a while longer before passing any major decision.
The "dissolvement" of the marriage is canceled.
Oh.
Thank you, Your Majesty.
A-and Darrin, uh, can come to Salem?
Out of the question.
No mortal.
You mean-- You mean, Ernest is one of us?
And Darrin Stephens may come to Salem.
Touché, my dear.
But remember this: There is a vast difference between playing with a mortal and marrying it.
With all due respect, Your Majesty don't knock it till you've tried it.
Prepare the ancestral grounds for our arrival.
Away.
You too, Caesar and Cleopatra.
Now-- Now, now, now, now.
None of that.
Mommy will be along any moment.
Your Majesty, uh, if your arm isn't too tired from waving, uh, we'd certainly appreciate having the house back the way it was.
Nonsense.
It is our gift to you.
Well, Your Majesty, we really don't deserve it.
I mean, after the trouble we've caused you.
Quite right.
Ugh.
Well we will be on our way.
Take care of our Samantha.
We're warning you.
Hepzibah will be watching.
Terrific.
How could she know my mother gave us that?
Larry!
Sam.
Darrin, heh.
Uh, forgive me for dropping in unannounced, but, uh, I was on my way to the office, and I just dropped by to-- What happened to your redecorating?
Uh, well, uh, A-Aunt Hepzibah turned out to be an Indian giver.
When she left, she took Windsor Castle with her.
So we-- We just brought the other stuff down from the attic.
Oh.
Darrin, how did you manage it?
Well, we, uh-- We got a couple of moving men, and-- I mean, how did you manage to talk Hitchcock into going to Salem with you?
Oh, that.
I'd rather not talk about it, Larry.
Then you tell me, Sam.
The genius is so modest.
Well, all-- All right.
The "genius" said to himself: "What would Larry do if he were in my place"?
Good, good.
And when he saw Mr. Hitchcock making eyes at Hepzibah, well Yeah, yeah?
He decided to play matchmaker.
You son of a gun.
What happened to the vase?
Well, it, uh-- It broke when we were moving things back.
It's easily replaced.
Hm.
Oh.
Well, I-- I'd better run.
I'm late for an appointment.
Bye-bye.
"Hepzibah will be watching".
Oh, just one more thing.
If you need me in Salem to help with Hitchcock, feel free.
Oh, well-- Yeah.
Heh-heh.
The vase.
Whatt happened?
Well, um I told you it was easily replaced.
Oh.
Uh, just one more thing.
What about the spell on Hitchcock?
Oh, i'll fix that.
After ge get back from Salem.

{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
Oh, I can't imagine what's keeping Esmeralda.
Sam, the cab's here.
Uh, yes, sweetheart.
We'll just be a second.
Mommy, will you bring me a souvenir from the witches' convention?
Certainly, sweetheart.
And I want you to promise to be on your best behavior for Esmeralda.
If she ever gets here.
Mother, I appreciate your staying till she arrives, but if you're going to grumble, never mind.
Why can't you wait, and the three of us can fly up to Salem together?
Because Darrin happens to be old-fashioned.
He likes to do his flying in an airplane.
Sam?
Oh, if it isn't the voice of the turtle.
Mother.
Tabitha I want you to help Esmeralda take good care of your baby brother.
I will, Mommy.
Hear that, Adam?
You better mind me.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
Hey.
Hey there, big fella.
Hey.
Kiss Mama goodbye.
That's a boy.
Oh, yeah.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, darling.
See you in Salem.
Yes.
We'd better hurry, honey.
Well, if you're in such a hurry, Durwood, why don't you wait a while, and we'll fly up, uh, witches' style?
I'm not in that much of a hurry, thank you.
Mommy, why can't I go to the witches' convention?
Because it's only for grown-up witches.
Uh, the next convention's being held in about a hundred years.
Ask me then.
Oh, sure.
Sure, I understand.
I got two little witches of my own, 5 and 7.
And bye-bye again.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Oh.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye.
Take care of Adam.
Bye, Mother.
Hope Esmeralda's gotten to the house by now.
Yeah.
I really don't trust your mother.
What am I saying?
I don't trust Esmeralda either.
Heh-heh.
Oh, come on, sweetheart.
You know she'll be fine.
If she ever gets there.
Hm-hm.
Ooh.
What's the matter?
Um Uh, l-look who just came aboard.
Oh.
Sam, get her off of there.
Miss?
Yes?
Well-- Could I have a glass of water, please?
Certainly.
Elsie, come-- Come here, quick.
What's the matter?
You won't believe this, but there's a lady sitting out on the wing.
You're right.
I don't believe it.
Mother, that was dirty pool, and you know it.
I just wanted you to know that Esmeralda arrived, and I didn't want you to worry.
Elsie, now there's two of them sitting out there on that wing.
Oh, wow.
You must have had some night.
Mother, I refuse to argue with you at 30,000 feet.
I-I'll see you in Salem.
Now, if your mother would be so kind as to lower her flaps and get off of there.
I know it sounds crazy, but please come take a look.
Come on, please.
Come on.
Please.
Mm?
I believe you have my seat.
Oh, I think there's been some mistake.
There has, and you just made it.
Mother, that was outrageous.
You're right.
In my day, a gentleman automatically gave his seat to a lady.
Endora, do you ever think of anyone but yourself?
What's gonna happen when that poor guy doesn't arrive in Boston?
For your information, dum-dum, he has arrived.
He's just a little ahead of schedule.
Well?
What time did Flight 107 arrive?
Flight 107?
It's just now arriving, sir.
That's what I was afraid of.
Lovely flight, wasn't it?
Tsk.
Must your mother ride on the outside of everything?
Can't she sit in the car like a normal human be-- Pardon me.
I lost my head.
Darrin, try to understand.
That's as close as Mother can get to flying and still be riding.
Just be patient.
Oh, after we check in at the hotel, we're gonna drive around Salem and see the sights.
You wanna come?
Whatever for?
We saw those sights hundreds of years ago.
Remember?
Let's face it, Endora, hundreds of years ago, you were one of the sights.
I told you it was a mistake to let him come.
Stop the car.
Stop the car.
Look.
That's disgraceful.
They're all over town.
They're just for the tourists.
Not for these tourists.
And they're no longer all over town.
Oh, Mother.
Did she have to do that?
Now, sweetheart.
Witches have feelings too.
How would you like to be thought of as an ugly old crow?
And it's a misconception.
I don't know about that.
Darrin!
Hey, isn't that the witch house over there?
Isn't this the place where they held the witch trials?
Hm.
One of them.
Uh, let's drive on.
Well, as long as we're here, wouldn't you like to go in?
Darrin.
That's like asking Napoleon if he'd like to revisit Waterloo.
What Durwood lacks in couth, he makes up in ignorance.
Sweetheart.
There were no real witches involved in the witch trials.
It was only mortal prejudice and hysteria.
Characteristics which you possess in spades, dum-dum.
Remember, darling, the convocation starts promptly at midnight.
Endora-- One thing I can say for your mother: She's a real mother-in-law.
Witches.
Before we begin our tour, I must ask you not to touch any of the objects in the house.
They're all very valuable, and many of them cannot be replaced.
Please try to stay together and do not wander off, as there is another tour waiting to start as soon as we leave the kitchen.
This is a bedwarmer of the period.
Hot stones or coals were placed in it, and the bedwarmer was then passed between the sheets to warm them and then removed.
Over here there's a colonial pressing iron, which was heated in the same way.
As you can see the kitchen fireplace served as a counterpart to the modern oven.
The bread oven is this, uh, small opening to the left.
And for general cooking, all the pots and kettles were-- Uh, were hung directly over the fireplace.
Now, if you will all please step to this side of the room.
This is a spinning wheel of the period.
Materials used for clothing, table covers, bed linens, and so forth, were all woven by hand from flax, which was grown on the land.
Now, over here, you will see a-- What are you doing with that?
Well, i-it looked like it was going to fall, so I just-- Apparently, I did not make myself clear.
It is absolutely forbidden to touch any of the objects in the house.
And that applies to everyone.
Now, if you will all please follow me into the living room.
You ought to know better than to pick that up.
I didn't pick it up.
It picked me up.
What?
Come on.
This is the living room of the House of Seven Gables, which Nathaniel Hawthorne visited many times.
He learned the history of the house, and this inspired him eventually to write his famous novel, The House of the Seven Gables.
If you will step to the window, you will see out in the-- I don't know who you are or what you are, but I wish you'd stop bugging me, before you get me into serious trou-- I used to have one just like it at the rest home.
Shh.
Stay there.
TOUR  The chair was made by Later, the name was changed TOUR  This fine old example of a 17th-century dwelling, built in 1668 by John-- --in the house, all of them prominent Salem citizens.
--gables and lean-to of the house.
Sam, what the devil are you doing?
It won't let me pass.
What is it?
Well, how should I know?
He just won't let me pass.
"He"?
Well, I-I'm not sure.
It might be a she.
Sam.
Well?
And just what do you think you're doing?
Me?
Nothing.
This thing has been annoying my wife.
This is the last time I'm going to warn you.
If you touch another object in the house, I'll have to ask you to leave.
This concludes our tour.
I hope you have enjoyed your visit to the House of the Seven Gables.
Thank you for visiting us.
Please come again soon.
Thank you for visiting us.
Please come again soon.
Thank you-- Uh, thank you.
Goodbye.
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.
Miss Ferndale, the bedwarmer.
It's gone.
Oh, no.
And I bet I know who stole it.
That crazy lady that was talking to it.
Don't worry, Mildred.
I've memorized their license number.
Just because I'm a witch doesn't mean I know everything.
I'm not asking you to explain everything.
I just wanna know why a bedwarmer would suddenly start chasing you around the house.
It is obviously no ordinary bedwarmer.
No kidding.
Uh, will you stop being so sarcastic?
I will if you'll stop being so evasive.
Are you implying that I'm hiding something?
It wouldn't be the first time.
What's that supposed to mean?
If the voodoo fits, wear it.
Oh!
Well Now we're going to descend to that, are we?
I don't know to what you are referring.
Just don't try it again.
Sam, you do that once more, and I swear I will-- Darrin, look.
It followed us.
You little sneak.
What are you doing back--?
And I say we are not going to take it back to the antique store.
I like it, and I'm going to keep it.
Uh, okay.
Okay.
It seems to be prejudiced against you.
Bigot.
Bigot?
Mother?
Mother?
What do you need her for?
Just zap this thing back where it belongs.
Darrin, this is not a "thing".
That must be obvious even to you.
I resent that.
And what do you mean?
This is a "somebody".
There is a person being held prisoner in this bedwarmer.
And since it dates back to old Salem, that's probably when it happened.
Uh, but I was just a child at the time.
And I was just a child bride.
Oh, really, Samantha.
I should think you'd know better than to bother me at a time like this.
I haven't even drawn up the agenda for tonight's meeting.
Well, I-I'm very sorry, Mother, but, um, it's about this bedwarmer.
Oh?
It practically attacked me in the House of Seven Gables.
Ha-ha.
It's much more attractive than that bedwarmer.
Endora you have all the charm of a dentist's drill.
Well, a-anyway, uh, when we left the House of Seven Gables, it followed me.
Now-- Uh, what do you think we should do?
I think we ought to take it right back and forget it.
Ow!
Well, whoever he is, he certainly has a sense of humor.
I was right.
I-it's a he.
You get off my wife's lap.
Boy, are you are asking for a punch in the mouth.
Really.
He's obviously left over from the time of the witch hunts.
He's probably a warlock whose powers weren't too effective, and somebody changed him into an inanimate object to escape detection.
He seems to be saying you're right.
Mm-hm.
Either that or he's got a chill.
Do you realize how much trouble we can get into if we're found with this bedpan?
Darrin.
This is a bedwarmer.
Oh.
Sorry, fella.
There's nothing we can do right now, but at tonight's meeting, there's bound to be somebody who remembers the incident, and we'll find the proper spell.
See you at the meeting tonight, darling.
Ta.
Well, in the meantime, I'd better hide this-- It.
Him.
Nobody likes a hostile bedwarmer.
That's the license number, all right.
That's the car.
I'm positive.
Perhaps you'd better come upstairs with us, Miss Ferndale, and help us make the identification.
Oh, I'd be glad to, officer.
As far as I'm concerned, people who go around stealing museum pieces are the lowest form of criminals.
I just hope we're in time to recover the bedwarmer.
I'm sure we will be.
Hi, fellas.
Uh, what's all this about a bedwarmer?
Hi, Mr. Potter.
Nothing you'd be interested in.
Seen a couple going in the hotel with a bedwarmer.
Then they still have it.
Maybe.
Maybe not.
That fellow was sure sore at that bedwarmer.
Sore, Mr. Potter?
Yeah.
It kept banging him on the head.
Oh, did it?
Well, thanks for telling us.
Hey, wait a minute.
I didn't tell you about the witch's sign.
What about it?
They changed the old witch on the sign to a pretty young witch.
Oh, that's wonderful.
I've been trying to get the town council to do that for years.
Town council didn't do it.
It was them witches.
They changed the signs all over the place.
What witches?
Same ones that have got the bedwarmer.
Uh, they drove by while I was sitting there drinking my lunch.
They "drove by," eh?
And all of a sudden, one of 'em disappeared.
Just like: And then there was two.
Well, I'll tell you what, Mr. Potter.
You stop hitting that sarsaparilla, and I guarantee you won't see any more witches.
Miss Ferndale.
Uh, look, Mr. Potter, why don't you stand over here and hold up the building?
And we'll be back for you in a minute, okay?
All I know is, I don't wanna get caught with-- excuse the expression --a hot bedwarmer.
So will you please zap it back where it belongs?
Darrin, this is a warlock who has been transformed.
Now, don't you think I have a moral obligation to help him?
I think you have a moral obligation to see that we stay out of jail on the first day of what I laughingly refer to as a vacation.
Ow!
Sam, if you don't get rid of that, I will with an axe.
Who is it?
Open up.
Police.
Sam, honey, quick.
Zap it out of here.
What's the matter?
He doesn't want to go.
Well, this is no time to give him a choice.
Darrin, there is a warlock in there.
Now, if he refuses to leave, my witchcraft won't work.
You witches have the dumbest rules.
And at the dumbest times.
Open up in there.
I'd better hide it.
Boy, are you stubborn.
Uh, c-c-coming.
Uh, Sam before i let them in, uh, maybe you'd better disappear.
Well, i mean why should, we both risk getting into truble?
Absolutely not.
'' For better, for worse,''remember?
''In sickness or in health, till jail do us part.
'' Darrin faces the wrath of Salem justice, and Samantha's hot bedwarmer comes to life, adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
Uh, there's witches up there.
See?
See?
See?
Heh-heh.
They changed the witch sign from an old hag witch to a pretty young witch.
And the cops are going up there right now, and they're gonna get 'em for taking the bedwarmer.
Sam, I don't wanna spend the first day of what I laughingly call a vacation, in jail.
But, sweetheart, it isn't my fault that the bedwarmer followed me back from the House of Seven Gables.
Sam, we're harboring a hot bedwarmer.
Now, will you please zap it back to where it belongs.
Darrin, this is a warlock who has been transformed.
Now, don't you think I have a moral obligation to help him?
I think you have a moral obligation to see that we stay out of jail.
Ow!
Sam, if you don't get rid of that, I will.
With an axe.
Who is it?
Open up.
Police.
Sam, honey, quick.
Zap it out of here.
What's the matter?
He doesn't wanna go.
Well, this is no time to give him a choice.
Darrin, there is a warlock in there.
Now, if he refuses to leave, my witchcraft won't work.
You witches have the dumbest rules.
And at the dumbest times.
Open up in there.
I'd better hide it.
Boy, are you stubborn.
Coming.
Oh.
Hello, Miss Ferndale.
We'd like to talk to you about something.
You mind if we come in?
Uh, not at all.
Is that him?
Yes.
And that's her.
And if you don't mind, I'm going to look for my bedwarmer.
to make the identification.
The rest is up to us.
Oh.
Very well.
I'll never understand how you thought you could get away with it.
With what?
Officer, please call me as soon as you recover the bedwarmer.
I certainly will.
You were both at the House of the Seven Gables today?
Uh, that's right.
Have either one of you any knowledge of a bedwarmer?
I-- I do.
Uh, first, you put the hot coals inside, a-and then you pass it between the cold sheets to warm them.
I don't think you understand.
This valuable antique was missing from the House of the Seven Gables today, right after you people left.
W-- Now, wait a minute.
Uh, you're not implying that we stole it?
Oh, uh, of course not, sweetheart.
The officers are just doing their duty.
When they find out they have the wrong party, I'm sure they'll apo-- --logize.
Wrong party, huh?
O-officer, we are telling the truth.
We did not steal it.
No?
What did it do?
Follow you here?
Yes.
As a matter of fact, it did.
Wiseacre remarks are not going to help you.
You're both under arrest.
She had nothing to do with it.
Okay.
Then you're under arrest.
It's, uh heavier than it looks.
Excuse me.
May I?
Now, I want you to go with these nice gentlemen.
And I want you to stay put until you hear from me.
I don't want you to do anything rash.
You understand?
Grab it.
Grab what?
The bedwarmer.
You grab it.
All right, let's go.
Up here, Samantha.
Oh.
Uh, Mother, you have to help me.
Just a minute.
I'm looking over the agenda for tonight's meeting.
But it's an emergency.
Oh.
What is it?
The police have arrested Darrin for stealing that bedwarmer.
And?
He's in jail.
You call that an emergency?
That's not funny.
Excuse me.
Why are you so upset?
What's the worst that can happen?
Uh-- They'll put Durwood away for a week or a month.
Or a year at the most if we're lucky.
Mother, sometimes you can be positively vicious.
Thank you, my precious pet.
Yeah.
Now, now, look.
They cannot hold Darrin if I can get rid of the evidence.
Uh, now, I have to find the spell that'll turn that bedwarmer back to its original form.
The only one who can tell you that is the witch who cast it.
Well, I know that.
That's why I want you to put me on the agenda so I can ask if anyone knows about it.
Well, it's a pretty long agenda right now.
We probably won't get to you tonight.
Mother either I am first on the agenda, or Daddy is going to find out all about you and Sir Walter Raleigh.
What is there to find out?
The dear man was kind enough to put his cape down over a puddle for me.
You invited him home to dinner.
So what?
Mother, uh, when you sent me to bed after dinner I didn't go to bed.
Oh, heh.
Guess who's first on the agenda?
All right.
All right.
It's time to get started.
Let's settle down, shall we?
As chairlady I declare the Centennial Convocation of the Witches of the World to be in session.
The first on the agenda is my daughter, Samantha.
Thank you.
You have 10 seconds.
What?
How can I explain the problem in 10 seconds?
You now have eight seconds.
Uh, I-- I want to know if anyone here has any knowledge of an incident that apparently took place during the witch hunts.
It involves a bedwarmer.
Well, we have to move on.
The next order of business-- Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, Mother, please.
Now what?
Will you try?
You try.
Send a message out to the atmospheric continuum.
Oh.
Very well.
Will those in front move back a bit?
There may be a little fallout.
Sparks fly up And fire rise While I the air Do mesmerize Find the one Who cast the spell And bring him To this ferny dell Well, we should have an answer within a few minutes.
Oh, good.
Uh, that'll give me time to pop down to jail and see Darrin.
Uh, he's going to be tickled when he finds out how cooperative you've been.
Tsk.
I may be ill.
I'll go quietly, officer.
Oh.
Oh.
Can't you stop snoring?
Only if I stop sleeping.
Forget it.
Go back to sleep.
Can't.
Once I'm up, I'm up for the rest of the-- Hi, sweetheart.
Sam, what are you doing here?
Suppose somebody sees you?
I just dropped in for a minute to tell you the good news.
Mother just sent out a call to find the person who put the spell on that bedwarmer.
I knew it.
I knew it.
They're back.
The witches are back.
You'd better cut out of here quick.
Okay.
Bye-bye, sweetheart.
See you in court.
All right now.
What's all the fuss?
Wouldn't believe me when I told you there was witches, huh?
Explain to me how she got in here.
Who?
Her.
What--?
W-what happened to her?
Mr. Potter go back to sleep.
And have another nightmare?
Not me.
Good.
That's the first break I've had all day.
Oh, Samantha.
We've been waiting for you.
Has anything happened?
Uh, yes.
Uh, the witch who cast that spell just arrived.
Uh, she's over there with your mother.
Serena.
Might have known.
Oh!
Oh, there you are, darling.
Look what the atmospheric continuum blew in.
Hi, Serena.
Hi, Sammy.
Figures.
Okay.
Uh, just give me the spell you used to change him.
Oh, you've got to be kidding.
That was I can't remember that far back.
She has a hard enough time remembering what happened yesterday.
Ha-ha-ha!
Thanks, Auntie Endora.
Well, I have to get back to the palace before the maharajah's wives return from the seashore.
Uh-uh.
No, no.
You're not going anywhere.
Not until we straighten this out.
Mother?
Now what?
What you are going to do is send her back to old Salem so she can re-create the incident and sharpen her memory.
Okay.
Let's get this show on the road.
Winds blow And stars turn round Into the past With the speed of sound Take this witch To the time and place Back to the scene Of Salem's disgrace Uh, uh-- Uh, Serena.
Widow Patterson.
What has happened to thee?
I am accused of being a witch.
Oh.
Oh, Serena.
Thou art too much.
Oh.
Thy lovely wench.
Mm.
Mm-hm-hm.
Ooh.
Serena.
Ah!
Serena.
Well, what art thou doing?
Well, I'm not picking cotton.
What can I do for you, chum?
What are those lips?
Groovy, huh?
Why is thy speech suddenly so strange to mine ears?
Don't ask me.
I'm not an ear doctor.
Have you ever heard of knocking before you enter a lady's house?
Well, we have no secrets from each other, have we, sweetest?
Hast thou thought about my proposal?
What proposal?
Oh.
Oh.
Y-you mean about getting married.
Oh, get up, Newton.
We had a lovely weekend.
Why spoil it?
Spoil it?
I just wanna make it last forever and a day.
I might consider a day but you can forget about forever.
Oh, Serena.
I shall never leave thy side.
That could make things a bit awkward.
Art thou expecting somebody?
No.
But you never know when the witch hunters might barge in.
Not that we couldn't barge out, butoh, it's just such a nuisance.
Aye.
And my witchcraft isn't all it should be.
That's not the only thing.
Hm?
Oh, that reminds me.
Uh, Captain Nichols stopped me on the street the other day and asked me a lot of questions about you.
No.
Yes.
Y-you mean, they suspect me?
Uh, w-what did you tell him?
Well, I just said-- Who is it?
Captain Nichols.
It is he.
He knows I am here.
He's coming after me.
C-c-come.
W-we had best vanish.
I'm not going to vanish till I finish my hair.
But perhaps you had best.
Yes.
Yes, it-- It might be wise.
See?
When I'm nervous, my powers keep failing me.
So I've noticed.
What am I to do?
I know.
I know.
I'll change you into something inanimate.
What would you like to be?
I-it makes little difference.
Just do it.
Rumble-ty tumble-ty Snickety snack This spell will give you Just what you lack Courage and calm Particularly the former Zippity-zappity You're now a bedwarmer Oh, no.
Not-- Oh.
Cute.
No, you don't.
Coming.
What took thee so long to answer?
Wouldst have me come to the door half-dressed?
Why not?
Oh!
She'll be back in a moment.
This is getting to be a drag, Auntie Endora.
One more unwelcome interruption, and I am going to freak out.
Never mind that.
Court's about to go into session.
Did you remember the spell?
Yes.
But I've been thinking.
If you change Newton back, he's gonna start bugging me again.
W-well, I'm sorry about that, Serena, but it's the only way I can clear Darrin.
It is, huh?
You sure?
Positive.
Sammy would it really be so terrible if Ding-dong spent one or two years in jail?
What?
!
You give me that spell!
Gee.
It was just a suggestion.
Hi there.
Well you're early.
Courtroom's right down the hall.
Won't be in session for another half hour.
I know.
Um, I-I was wondering if you could do me a favor.
What's that?
Sleep tight.
Will you behave yourself?
Rumble-ty tumble-ty Snicker-y snack This is the spell That will change you back First a warlock Then a bedwarmer Zippity-zappity Now you're the former Oh, Serena, my dearest.
Ow.
Uh-- You look lovely as a blond.
Newton, I am not S-Serena.
What?
No, I-I-I'm her cousin, Samantha.
Oh, she must have told you about me.
Oh, yes.
How do you do, Samantha?
How do you do?
Now, where is my darling Serena?
That was a rotten trick she pulled on me, but I still dig that chick.
"Dig"?
"Chick"?
How did a 300-year-old bedwarmer get so hip?
By keeping my ears open and my lid shut.
Now, take me to Serena.
Well, I-I think there's something you should know.
Yes?
In exchange for giving me the spell, your darling Serena made me promise that you would never bother her again.
Ever.
Under any circumstances.
She said that?
Yes.
You know, maybe I ought to forget about her.
Good idea.
And start thinking about you.
No, forget it, Newton.
I've been out of circulation so long.
Well, a little bit longer can't hurt.
Let's bring you up-to-date.
Oh, lovely.
Mm-hm.
Where are we going?
To court.
Terrific.
Whom am I going to be courting?
Brother.
Do you have a one-track mind.
True, true.
Robbed?
Told you I had a plan.
Some plan, stealing the evidence.
Some gratitude.
How can you say that to this lovely lady who liberated me?
I can say it because this lovely lady is my wife.
Oh?
Oh.
Oh.
Miss-- Miss Ferndale, hello-- Sit down, Newton.
She only knows you as a bedwarmer.
True.
I've been hanging there for years admiring her.
Will the defendant please approach the bench?
Now, the evidence seems to be missing.
You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you?
Me?
Your Honor, I was locked up all night.
Uh, e-excuse me, Your-- Your Honor.
Uh, perhaps I can explain.
She's the defendant's wife, Your Honor.
Yes?
Well, I-I don't know whether the officers mentioned this in their report or not, but, uh, that was a very unusual bedwarmer.
What is she talking about?
I haven't the slightest idea, Your Honor.
Me either.
Heh.
Although come to think of it, a lot of things that bedwarmer did were pretty quirky.
Quirky?
Yeah.
Weird.
It wouldn't let us lift it.
Yeah, only her.
Then she told it to do what she said, and it did.
It did, huh?
Yes.
Hopped right over to us.
Hopped?
Practically did a little jig.
Then when the sergeant had me put it in the closet it tried to bite me.
Oh.
How long has it been since these men have had a vacation?
Too long.
My apologies to you.
Case is dismissed.
Uh, w-wait.
Uh, Judge Ferguson, what about my bedwarmer?
Well, I don't know, Miss Ferndale, but we certainly have no case against this man.
Do-- D-do you mean to say that I'm not going to get it back?
That's just terrible.
I demand an investigation.
After all, I'm missing a bedwarmer.
Now, I want it back.
I understand.
What are you going to do about it?
Well, you see, the-- The evidence went missing I'm sorry, Miss Ferndale, but we have no evidence.
And without evidence, we cannot prosecute.
And as for the bedwarmer, I cannot return that which seemingly never existed.
Now, I don't know what you mean by "no evidence".
The evidence is the bedwarmer is missing.
Uh, forgive me.
What?
Yes?
Forgive me for intruding.
But perhaps the bedwarmer can be replaced.
Uh-- Who are you?
Uh, this is Newton.
He's sort of an expert on bedwarmers.
Oh.
Well the one we had was very unique.
Oh, thank you.
I mean, uh, is that true?
Well, just keep your fingers crossed.
It may show up yet.
And if it doesn't, I personally guarantee I will duplicate it.
Duplicate it?
How?
By witchcraft, of course.
What?
Uh, Newton.
I don't think it's very nice to tease someone who lives in Salem just because they once believed in witches.
I'm sorry.
Dear lady why don't we have lunch and discuss the whole matter?
Well, I'd love to.
Sure has a way with the ladies, doesn't he?
That's for sure.
Anywayit looks as if Miss Ferndale has got herself another bedwarmer.

{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
Darrin.
You're pacing.
What?
You know, "to-ing" and "fro-ing," and "to-ing" and "fro-ing".
I wasn't even aware of it.
Mm, I guess it's because I feel a little guilty about dropping the whole Barrows Umbrella account in Larry's lap.
Sweetheart, we are in Salem on a vacation.
Sort of.
Now, we planned to take a nice drive up the coast to Gloucester and have some lobster and-- And that's probably Larry.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll get rid of him.
Oh.
Hi, Larry.
Hey.
How'd you know it was me?
A wild guess.
I bet you can't guess why I'm calling.
It's about the Barrows Umbrella account, and you want me to-- Wrong.
I'm calling because I got an idea how you can have a vacation with pay.
I thought that's what I had.
Oh, you do.
You do.
What I was referring to is a little extra bonus.
And to get it, all you have to do is come down here to Boston and help me cinch the Barrows account.
I thought you said you weren't calling about the Barrows account.
Oh, I'm not.
I'm calling about your bonus.
Forget it, Larry.
Now, you have my rough layouts and-- Oh, yes, and they're fine.
They're fine.
Good.
Then you can cinch the Barrows account on your own.
I must say, you're not showing much appreciation to someone who merely called to offer you a bonus.
Not interested, Larry.
And good luck with Barrows.
Bye.
Ingrate!
Oh.
Well, that's too bad.
Too bad?
Y-yes.
I've been called to an emergency meeting of the Witches' Council.
Terrific.
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart, but Mother's giving a special demonstration of incantations past, present and future.
Uh, maybe you could call him back.
Before I'd call him back, I'd go sightseeing alone.
Why alone, when Serena's ready, willing and able?
Hi, little cousin.
Hi there, tall, dark and mortal.
If you don't mind, Serena, you're one sight I'd rather not see.
Oh.
The charm-school dropout is in rare form today.
Ha-ha!
Serena, the hotel doesn't allow pets or helicopters in the room, so would you mind getting rid of it?
That can be arranged.
And when you get rid of it, be sure you're in it.
Oh, that's cute.
Darrin, there's no reason to be rude.
I'm sorry I was a few days late for the convention, Sammy, but I got involved in the world kite-flying championships in India.
Uh, guess what.
What?
I was disqualified.
Disqualified?
On a mere technicality.
Instead of flying it, I towed it.
Oh, that's a shame.
I wouldn't have disqualified you.
You wouldn't?
Of course not.
The longer you're in the air, the more chance you have of hitting a tree.
Ohh.
Sweetheart, i-in the best interest of keeping peace in the family, why don't you reconsider and go sightseeing with Serena?
I have to go to the meeting anyway.
Two's company, except when she's one of the two.
I could meet you at the Gloucester House for lunch.
Absolutely under no circumstances will I go anyplace with her.
Oh!
He's such a darling.
And since the invitation comes straight from the heart, I accept.
Mwah.
Good.
I'll meet you there about noon.
I think I missed something somewhere.
Get in.
I will, just as soon as I get over the shock.
I was expecting a broom.
My broom is getting a lube job.
This is a loaner.
Ah!
I'll drive.
Okay, poopsie.
I like it.
I like it.
It's certainly the work of a talented man.
Well, then, shall we get down to the business of, uh, contracts, et cetera?
But it misses.
It just misses.
Well, I'm sure Stephens will have no trouble putting it on target.
And I guarantee we'll shoot the sales of Barrows Umbrellas far beyond your expectations.
I expect everybody in the world to own a Barrows umbrella.
Stop the car!
Stop the car.
What is that?
It's just a statue.
Well that statue is a sight, and we are sightseeing.
"They that go down to the sea in ships".
Who is this cat, anyway?
Don't you know anything?
This is the famous Fisherman's Memorial.
Oh.
And what a knockout of a memorial he is.
Just dig that weather-beaten face and those powerful arms.
Ah!
What a ball to be steered by him.
Well, Serena, this is the closest you're going to get to this "cat," unless you turn yourself into a seagull.
Dum-dum, I wouldn't bet my plantation on that if I were you.
Pride of Gloucester Sentinel of the sea I deem you come alive And swagger down to me Still think he's for the birds?
Avast, ye hearties.
What the devil's going on here?
You might call it fun and games.
Well, I call it insanity.
Serena, put this statue back, or-- Oh!
He is not a statue.
He is flesh and blood.
Here, touch him.
Touch me person, and I'll thrash you within an inch of your life.
You can touch me.
But himno.
Serena, I'm not asking you, I'm telling you.
Put this statue back, or I-- Here.
What a wench.
It's been 50 years since I've kissed a lassie.
Oh!
Whoopee!
You know something?
They're better when they're aged.
Serena, I'm finished with you.
Well, I'm not.
Goody.
Serena.
If there isn't a statue holding on to that wheel by the time I count to three, there's going to be trouble.
Dum-dum you are absolutely right.
Start counting.
One, two-- Don't forget, it was your idea.
Shiver me timbers.
What's that?
Oh, that is a car.
It's used for transportation and air polluting.
Listen, me ancient mariner, uh, why don't we split to someplace more romantic, so you can catch up on all you've been missing these last few years?
"Split"?
Uh, leave, embark, set sail.
I'll have none of it if I have to sail there.
Well, "set sail" is just an expression.
Besides, what have you got against water?
Nothing.
It just scares me out of my wits.
Well, that's ridiculous.
You're an able-bodied seaman.
You forget, I stand for all those able-bodied seamen that drowned.
Okay.
Heave to and we'll fly there.
The only water you'll see is the kind you pour over your Scotch.
They call this paradise?
I haven't named it yet.
It's just a little something I whipped up to make myself comfortable in Salem.
Come, come.
Sayuh, how about sitting down and-- And resting those strong, magnificent sea legs of yours?
Let's not get too close to the water, please.
Who's that?
Oh, it's just an ex-friend of mine.
He got stoned one night, so I left him that way.
Oh.
What's the matter, sweetie?
Me back, lassie.
Me back.
I've been standing over that wheel for almost 50 years.
Me back is killing me.
Oh, dear.
Well, uh, here.
Now let me rub it for you.
How's that?
Oh.
Lower, lassie.
Lower.
Gladly.
Oh!
You are gorgeous.
Oh, my.
Ooh!
Darrin.
I-is that you in there?
Oh, sweetheart.
I don't know what to say except I have a cousin who makes Lucrezia Borgia look like Shirley Temple.
But don't you worry.
I'll figure out a way to get you out of there.
The hotel clerk said they're having lunch at the Gloucester House.
I'm sure we'll find him there.
I hope so, Mr. Tate.
Oh, as a matter of fact, there's Mrs. Stephens now.
Where?
I'll say one thing, though: If you have to be a statue, this is a nice place to be one.
Over there, talking to that statue.
Huh?
I mean, over there by that statue.
Oh.
Darrin's probably around someplace.
Come on, I wanna introduce you.
Sam!
Hi, Sam.
Heh-heh.
Ha-ha.
Am I glad I found you.
Oh, well, hi, Larry.
W-w-what are you doing in Gloucester?
Hopefully, having lunch with you and Darrin.
Oh, Mr. Barrows, this is Mrs. Stephens.
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, Mr. Barrows is head of Barrows Umbrellas, and he's just dying to hear some of Darrin's new ideas.
That's nice.
Where is he?
Who?
Darrin.
Oh!
He's hanging around here somewhere.
Mrs. Stephens, Tate here speaks very highly of your husband.
He's got him on some kind of pedestal.
Oh.
Well, that's nice.
Darrin's very comfortable o-on a pedestal.
Yes, sir.
Ha.
Well, Sam.
Let's go find him, and we can go on to lunch together.
Oh, oh.
Let's not bother with Darrin.
Uh, let's just go to lunch, just the three of us.
The three of us?
Oh, it'll be fun.
Sam, are you all right?
No.
I mean-- Um, well-- I get a little lightheaded when I'm hungry.
And I am just dying for one of those lobsters.
Larry.
Come on, Larry.
Come on.
You know, it's funny, I've never seen this statue before, but it looks very familiar to me.
Wait.
This is the Fisherman's Memorial.
It's dedicated to the more than 10,000 fishermen who lost their lives at sea.
Come to think of it, he looks more defiant and ferocious than I remember him.
Oh, he looks ferocious, all right.
Sam.
Is that all you can see?
Huh?
You know, it's amazing.
The face of this statue looks a-- A great deal like Stephens.
Sam, can't you see the resemblance?
No.
Not really.
I mean, examine the chin.
That is not Darrin's strong chin.
Yeah.
His chin is kind of weak.
Very.
Well, now that we decided the statue doesn't look like Mr. Stephens, suppose we take Mrs. Stephens to lunch?
Uh, uh-- Why don't you two go on without me?
But you just said you were starving.
Yes, I did, didn't I?
Hm.
Well, um, why don't you two go to the Gloucester House, and I'll wait here for Darrin?
But we don't wanna take a chance on missing Darrin.
Why don't we all wait here?
O-oh, uh, Larry, uh, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Why not?
Yeah, why not?
Because I suddenly remembered that Darrin said he was going to take a walk, and he wanted me to meet him at the Gloucester House.
You suddenly remembered?
Yes.
I-I told you I get a little lightheaded when I get hungry.
Especially for lobster.
All right, Tate, let's go.
All this talk about lobster is making me hungry.
May I help you?
Uh, we're looking for Mr. Darrin Stephens.
Uh, we have a reservation for Mr. Stephens, but I don't believe he's arrived yet.
Well, that's strange.
I wonder what's holding him up.
I hate to think.
Larry, w-why don't you and Mr. Barrows go to the table?
I'll join you in a moment.
Right this way.
Mr. Barrows.
Bartender.
Set them up for everybody.
I'm buying.
And forget the little lady who was just here.
She must be a "toteetaler".
A teetotaler.
To-- I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I got back as soon as I could.
Trust me.
I will find Serena and get you out of there.
In the meantime, keep a stiff upper lip.
Oh, I didn't mean that.
Stars and planets And things in the know Whisk me to where Romance can grow Excuse me but I'm looking for two people whom I thought might be here.
One is-- Oh, you mean, uh, that pretty girl and that nutty-looking sailor?
They're the ones.
Not that I watched, mind you, because it was none of my business, but they was holding hands, and kissing and whispering to each other.
Y-you wanna know what they was whispering?
Uh, no, thank you.
Um, I just wanna know where they went.
Well, I, uh-- I turned back to my clipping, like this And when I turned back, like thisthey was-- Gone.
Just like you.
When John Paul Potter III drinks, everybody drinks.
Another round for the folks.
Wellthe little "toteetaler" is back.
How about a little nip, sweetie?
Oh, well, thanks, uh, but I think you are doing just fine for both of us.
Cheers.
Whoa-ho Blow the man down Gimme some fellows To follow the sea Gimme some time To blow the man down Blow the man down Please blow the man down Whoa, oh!
Blow the man down Young man.
Will you shut up for a moment?
You watch your tongue, landlubber.
I'll have you swinging from the yardarm.
Now, you listen to me.
We're in a restaurant with a young lady.
Now, if I checked my umbrella, I see no reason why you can't check your hat.
You won't take my hat.
Ah.
There you are.
Sam, look who we ran into: Serena and herboyfriend.
I can't imagine what's keeping Darrin.
No offense, Mrs. Stephens, but I'll give him five more minutes, and then I leave.
And with me, Tate, goes my account.
Serena, I think you and I should have a few words together.
Excuse me, my little chicken of the sea.
Oh!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Chicken of the sea.
That's me.
Serena, I don't wanna know how, and I don't wanna know why.
I just want a fair exchange: Darrin for your seaman.
Well, okay, coz, but believe me that is not a fair exchange.
Are you sure you ladies wouldn't like a little drinky-poo?
Potter's springing.
So is Serena.
I think the party's over.
So long, dumbo.
Sam, what's happening?
Shh, shh.
Blow the man down Will we blow the man down Whoa, oh I hate to interrupt your good time, but if the Pirate of Penzance isn't out of here immediately, Barrows Umbrellas will be.
Where did he go?
He was, uh, shanghaied.
Come on.
Come on.
All right, Tate, let's get my hat and umbrella, and go.
But, Mr. Barrows-- Gentlemen, look who I found waiting outside.
Darrin.
Thank heaven.
Larry.
Uh, Mr. Barrows, this is Darrin Stephens.
Hello, Stephens.
Oh, Mr. Barrows.
Uh, Darrin, I've just been telling Mr. Barrows that the only reason you're at Salem is to work on some ideas for Barrows Umbrellas.
Mr. Stephens I've had a very difficult and strange day.
I no longer have any interest in any of your ideas.
Uh, Mr. Barrows, i-if you don't want to listen to Darrin, uh, would you listen to me?
Mrs. Stephens, I'm a businessman most of the time but I'm a gentleman all the time.
Please sit down.
Oh, thank you.
Nowtell me about it.
Well Darrin's idea is to use the Fisherman's Memorial as a symbol for Barrows Umbrellas.
That's why we were there.
Uh-huh.
Mr. Barrows, what percentage of umbrellas are bought by women?
About 80 percent.
Aha.
The men don't seem to wanna buy 'em, right?
Well, you see, Darrin's idea is to make the umbrella more attractive to men by associating it with a-- A masculine symbol: the Fisherman's Memorial.
Hmm.
Mr. Barrows, I'm sure if you hear Darrin present his idea, it'll be more impressive.
I like that idea.
But I doubt it.
You know, Samantha explained it so beautifully.
Tell us the rest of it, young man.
Uh, picture this: The helmsman, standing in the face of a fierce storm, one hand on the wheel, the other holding a Barrows umbrella.
I love it.
"Even the men who go down to the sea in ships carry Barrows umbrellas".
Stephensit's sensational.
Sensational.
You were well worth waiting for.
I told you he would be.
You son of a gun.
But I'd still like to know where you've been all this time.
W-well, Darrin was just staring out to the sea, thinking.
Isn't that right, sweetheart?
Yeah.
Heh-heh.
That's right.
Well, let's everybody have a drink.
Oh, great idea.
Waitress.
Waitress.
Doubles.
You know, sweetheart, that's a great idea.
"Even men that go down to the sea in ships carry Barrows umbrellas".
I've got an idea for another slogan: "Not even a nor'easter can blow out a Barrows umbrella".
Hi.
Speaking of ill winds Watch it, ding-dong.
I just popped in to give you the opportunity of thanking me.
For what?
Well, you landed the dumb account, didn't you?
I'll thank you to blow outta here.
Ta-ta.
Darrin you know something?
I think I liked your first slogan better.
Oh, boy.
adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
Sam, why do I get the feeling you're trying to bring Salem home, piece by piece?
Everything I bought was a real bargain.
When you go broke, it doesn't matter if you overpaid or got bargains.
Oh, hi.
A package just arrived for you, special messenger.
I set it on the table.
Thank you.
Just what we needed, another package.
Here.
Thanks.
Oh, Darrin, look at the darling teapot that Larry sent us.
Larry.
By special messenger?
I wonder what his angle is.
Does there always have to be an angle There have been times when he's done something nice without an ulterior motive.
When?
I wonder what his angle is.
Hello, Samantha, Mr. Stephens.
I'm sorry to bother you, but-- Esmeralda, you're not all here.
She's not all there either.
Darrin.
Oh, dear, I always do that when I'm rushing.
Is anything wrong at home?
Oh, no.
Everything's fine.
How's the vacation?
Excuse me for raising the point, but, uh, who's with the children?
Oh.
I got Aunt Hagatha to sit with them while I checked with you.
I was worried because Tabitha wants to change the baby.
Well, what's wrong with that?
She wants to change him into a rabbit.
Absolutely not.
I didn't wanna be too permissive.
Well, I guess I'd better get back and relieve Aunt Hagatha before Mrs. Tate gets there.
Uh, Mrs. Tate?
she'd drop in and check on the kids from time to time.
She takes a month's pay and turns it into a lot of packages.
And that's before lunch.
I'll just take them back with me.
Oh, no, don't bother, Esmeralda.
It's no trouble, Samantha.
No, no, Esmeralda.
Please, don't.
Sam, since the subject of change has come up, I'd like to propose one.
Sweetheart, Esmeralda may not be the greatest, but she is neat.
And the children adore her.
Oh, there are other possibilities.
There's Serena and Uncle Arthur and Mother and Daddy.
Like I always said, there's nothing wrong with Esmeralda.
Right.
Sweetheart, I've planned the whole afternoon.
After the Peabody Museum, we'll go visit the Pioneer Village and then we'll drive to Sturbridge and-- Hello.
Larry.
Don't let him talk you into anything.
By the way, Sam and I wanna thank you for that teapot you sent us.
We both think it's-- Oh?
It's not for us?
Well, that old teapot may help us swing the greatest deal since the Alaskan Purchase.
Larry, where are you?
He's still in Boston.
I thought you were going back to New York.
I decided to stay over, because I've run into a wonderful opportunity for you.
Larry, I hate to point this out, but when one is on vacation, and one starts working, one stops being on vacation.
Okay, okay.
We'll discuss it next time I see you.
Fine.
In the meantime, I'll send you a postcard.
Bye-bye.
I'm proud of you.
I don't know.
He gave in too easily.
Boston's only a half an hour from here.
We'd better get going.
Oh.
I have to get my purse.
Just as I thought.
Trying to pull a fast one and sneak out.
But being a bit sneaky myself, I was one step ahead of you.
I called from the lobby.
Larry, whatever it is you're up to, forget it.
Oh, don't turn me down without a hearing.
I appeal to you, Sam.
Reason with him.
Larry is absolutely right.
Listen to him, then turn him down.
All right.
I'm listening.
I'll give it to you in three words: Sir Leslie Bancroft.
That name doesn't ring a bell?
I don't even get a tinkle.
You get any vibrations from British Imperial Textile Mills?
He owns it.
Lock, stock and dividends.
Sir Leslie's just in from London.
And do you know why?
Darrin doesn't care why.
Do you, sweetheart?
That's right.
I don't care why.
Why?
To find the proper agency to devise a tasteful campaign to introduce his product to the American market.
And I think I've convinced him we're the ones to handle his account.
And how did you do that?
That's where the teapot comes in.
The old silver fox found out that Sir Leslie's a Revolutionary War buff.
Can you imagine how grateful Sir Leslie will be when you present him with an original Paul Revere teapot?
That's an original?
That's an authentic original reproduction.
That's original.
Forget it.
Sam and I have plans.
So have I. And they include our joining Sir Leslie, who's waiting in the park right now.
Forget it.
You mean you intend to persist in this stubborn, hard-nosed attitude of yours?
I do.
All right.
I don't need you.
I'll take my teapot and go.
I don't mean to be impatient, but I'd like to have my teapot, please.
Uh, the truth is, uh it's not here.
That's the truth, all right.
Exactly where is my teapot?
That's a good question.
Oh.
Uh I-I'll bet the maid p-put it in the bedroom.
I'll go look for it.
I'll help you.
Well, just hurry it up.
Esmeralda must have taken it when she took the rest of the packages.
You stall.
I'll pop home and get it.
First make sure Louise isn't there.
Okay.
Yes?
I-I'd like to speak to Esmeralda.
One moment, please.
What do you mean, you haven't got it?
It's in the hotel storage room, for security reasons.
Then I'll go down there and get it.
Which won't be open for 15 minutes, so why don't you and I have a little chat with Sir Leslie in the meantime?
I knew you wouldn't let me down.
You son of a gun.
Stephens residence.
E-Esmeralda, is Mrs. Tate there?
Yes, she's out on the patio with the children.
Uh, well, I was calling to find out if you took back one extra package by mistake.
It's a square box and it has an antique Paul Revere teapot in it.
Oh, wait a minute.
I'll look for it.
Oh.
Here it is.
Check.
I found it and I'll send it right back to you.
Maybe you'd better do that.
But, Esmeralda, that's a very special Paul Revere teapot, so please, please be careful.
Let me see, now.
How does that go again?
Um Oh, yes.
Pheasant, finch And a fat white gander Add a spotted salamander Season, baste Add dragon's ear Return the pot Of Paul Revere Tallyho, to Salem you go Oh, good grief.
And who are you, mistress?
A-and what manner of place is this?
Uh, M-Mr. Revere, please.
Uh, be patient.
I-I-I'll explain it all in just a minute.
Hello.
Hello, operator.
Operator.
Get me Esmeralda, quick.
Sir Leslie, this is Darrin Stephens, my associate.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I've heard some rather splendid things about you.
Heh-heh.
Larry's always exaggerating.
Your country owes a great deal to Roger Conant.
I'm well aware of that heroic English seaman.
His band was the first to settle in this area.
I see you're a history buff yourself.
Well, ever since I was a little boy.
You weren't exaggerating about your young man, not in the least.
Now, sir, I'm most anxious to hear your ideas on how to introduce my product to your country.
Well, I, uh, haven't worked out anything in detail.
Uh, so let's go back to Darrin's suite and chat, hmm?
He has an early American teapot he's anxious to show you.
Young man, how old is your teapot?
Oh.
It's old.
It could have been made by Paul Revere.
Jolly good.
Well, let's pop along and have a look at it, shall we?
You're a what?
A witch.
But a good witch.
I see.
So according to you, it's 200 years since the British were driven out.
We now have machines that fly in the air and boats that sail under the water.
I've forgotten the moon.
Surely we've flown to the moon.
Well, as a matter of fact, we have.
You are either a demented liar or the most artful of British spies.
That's not true.
I'm a loyal colonist.
Sam, I'm back with Larry and Sir Leslie.
Sir Leslie?
So you are in league with the British.
I must ride to warn my countrymen.
Oh, but beli-- Believe me, uh, Mr. Revere, there is no need for you to ride at this time.
Now, y-you stay here.
Trust me.
I'll let you know when it's time to make your ride.
It will go ill with you if I am betrayed.
Don't worry.
I'm ill already.
Sam?
Excuse me.
Oh, Sam.
Uh, Sir Leslie, this is my wife, uh, Samantha.
H-h-how do you do?
Sir Leslie Bancroft.
How do you do?
It's a great pleasure.
Hi.
Well, did you get the teapot?
Are you ready for a joke?
They lost the key to the storage room.
You'll excuse me if I don't collapse with laughter.
But it'll be here as soon as they make a new key.
There's no point in getting into a flap about it.
We'll just wait.
Oh, well, sit down.
Ah, thank you.
As a matter of fact, this will be a good time to hear some more about your ideas.
About what?
Oh.
Oh, the campaign.
Uh, well, I'd really like to surprise you with the idea when it's more fully developed.
Well, I'm warning you, it's got to be good.
Because my people tell me to expect stiff competition as we invade the American market and establish British Imperial as top dog for all time.
Calling any helpful goblin Elf or dryad, solve my problem Get the pot to go from here And Paul Revere to disappear Oh, dear.
What's the use?
I'm tired, and I've got a splitting headache, and my throat is getting hoarse.
A saturation campaign will capture the American-- You'll never succeed, Britisher!
Don't point that at me.
He's the Britisher!
You'll be opposed by every man, woman and child, sir.
Uh, uh, Sir Leslie, I-I'd like to introduce Mr.-- Revere, sir.
Paul Revere.
Yes, of course.
Delighted, I'm sure.
Who is this, anyway?
It's Paul Revere, isn't it, Sam?
Y-yes.
As a matter of fact, it is.
Uh, c-courtesy of Esmeralda.
Who?
Well, a-actually, uh, M-Mr. Revere is the head of a rock group.
He lives his part.
Surely you've heard of them?
Paul Revere a-and His Sons of Liberty.
Yes, I've heard of the group.
I thought they were younger.
Uh, well, yeah, th-they were w-when they first started.
But, uh, well, if you've heard their music, you know how it can age you.
I've heard enough.
You don't think I'd sit idly by and listen to your treasonous plans.
Open the door or lose it!
Excuse me.
Uh, you too.
The British are coming!
The British are coming!
Oh, no, no, wait, Mr. Revere!
No, wait a minute.
Oh, my stars.
Don't worry, Darrin, I'll catch him.
The British are coming!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
The British are coming!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
The British are coming!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
Whoa!
Oh!
Follow that horse!
I would hope there's a reasonable explanation for Mr. Revere's behavior.
I doubt it.
Heh.
But go ahead, have a whack at it.
A-all right.
Here it is.
He's a symbol.
Paul Revere alerting all America that the British are coming.
I'm afraid I don't quite follow.
Well, that is-- Heh-heh.
British Imperial Textiles is coming here.
Taking the country by storm.
I see.
Then this whole thing was an advertising stunt.
What'd I tell you about this boy?
There's your campaign in a nutshell.
You'll have the public eating out of your hand.
Sir Leslie?
Why are you putting on your hat?
I always do that when I'm leaving.
I run a business, not a circus.
You and your wild ideas.
"The British are coming".
Small correction.
The British are going.
To arms!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
To arms!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
Right on.
The British!
To arms!
Who's the joker we're chasing?
Paul Revere.
Lady, if you don't wanna answer, just say so.
W-well, I-I'm sorry.
Uh, th-this is a run-through for a peanut butter commercial.
Yeah, that's about what I figured.
To arms!
To arms!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
To arms!
The British are coming!
To arms!
The British are coming!
The British are coming!
To arms!
To arms!
I'll say this much about the Chamber of Commerce around here.
They put on a great show.
A fraternity initiation stunt?
He's getting a little old for that sort of thing, isn't he?
Well, uh, actually, sergeant, Uncle Charlie is a little eccentric.
A little?
Hmph.
You're right.
He's getting worse.
The truth is that, during the Revolutionary days, there was an organization called the Sons of Liberty that was headed by Paul Revere.
Uncle Charlie takes that organization very seriously.
You mean, he thinks he's Paul Revere?
You mean, he's--?
Oh, dear.
Tsk.
Just a moment, Miss Stephens.
Clancey!
Did you call me?
Uh, let the lady have a couple of minutes with that weirdo we just-- I'm sorry.
With Mr. Revere.
You've come to laugh at me.
Go ahead.
I don't blame you.
No.
No, Mr. Revere.
I am not going to laugh at you.
You were telling me the truth.
The world has moved on.
A world filled with all the marvels you talked about.
All I did was to play the fool.
Don't say that.
Your ride is history.
There was just no reason for you to ride again.
Would you send me back now?
Oh, I can't.
Esmeralda's working on it.
But before she does, there's something I'd like you to see.
Take my hand.
We'll make a quick trip to Boston.
Sorry, folks, but you'll just-- How did you let 'em get past you, Clancey?
I didn't.
I opened the door and they disappeared.
What am I talking about?
You saw them disappear.
I didn't see anything.
I'm gonna have to make a report on this, Clancey.
But-- And it's not gonna look good for you at all.
Look familiar, Mr. Revere?
That's me.
"Paul Revere".
"--and fused these lovers of liberty into an emerging nation".
And the Old North Church.
After all these years, it still stands.
One if by land, two if by sea.
Aye.
That was the signal, all right.
Ah.
I-I can't get over it.
A comely miss like you, a witch.
Well, we're not all hags, you know.
How strange.
Uh, no, not-- Not really.
It just means that Esmeralda's spell is working.
This is the first leg of your journey back.
No, no, no.
This teapot.
I made it.
It has endured all these years.
I beg your pardon, Mr. Revere, but it's a reproduction.
You see, it doesn't bear your mark.
But of course not.
You'll read no mark at all.
This is the teapot I was working on the night I was called to ride.
I couldn't expect my country to wait while I put my mark on a teapot.
In the days that followed, there was much confusion.
Somehow it disappeared.
Here.
Allow me.
For you, dear lady.
Oh.
Thank you, Mr. Revere.
You may call me Paul.
Well, y-you'll be leaving any moment.
It was a great pleasure meeting you, Mr.-- Paul.
Esmeralda, for once in your life, your timing was magnificent.
Of all the dimwitted, lamebrained ideas-- You're repeating yourself, Larry.
Yes, and I'm going to keep right on repeating myself.
Thanks to your lamebrained, dimwitted i-- Sir Leslie.
Sam.
Sam.
Well, h-how about this for a coincidence?
Sir Leslie and I met in the lobby.
L-Larry, wait a minute.
I think there's something-- I want you to have this, Sir Leslie.
A gift from me to you.
But, Larry-- But I thought it was Mr. Stephens' teapot.
That's right.
A gift from Stephens to you.
What is it, Sam?
Oh, uh, n-nothing important.
This is very kind of you, Mr. Stephens.
Now, I've been thinking about that idea of yours.
Oh, forget it.
It was all a mistake.
I was running a high fever at the time.
It's too late.
I've already seen the full-page ad.
The full-page ad?
What full-page ad?
You know, the one Sir Leslie saw.
And loved.
"The Mystery of the Daylight Ride of Paul Revere".
You know, the more I think about it, the more I realize that this ad is exactly what the doctor ordered.
Paul Revere on the highways and the byways, on the wireless, on the telly, in the newspapers, informing the American public that British Imperial Textiles is coming.
It's truly an inspiration.
No, I don't think that's quite the word.
Of course that's the word.
An inspiration.
I never doubted it for a minute.
I knew you'd come through, sweetheart.
And the chap that played the part.
He was a perfect Paul Revere.
Yes, he wasn't bad, was he?
Uh, perhaps we could-- Uh, Mr. Revere is in retirement, permanently.
Pity.
Great Scott.
This is a genuine Paul Revere.
Well, naturally.
You don't think Stephens would-- Genuine?
No doubt about it.
Oh, I can't accept this gift.
It's worth a fortune.
Well, in that case-- You keep your teapot, Mr. Stephens.
Now, I shall be getting back to Boston.
Will you be handling the business elements?
Uh, yes, but-- Well, let's you and I get back to my hotel, Mr. Tate, and start working out the details of our deal.
Yes, but-- Mrs. Stephens, so nice meeting you.
Sir Leslie.
Thanks again, young man.
Oh, my pleasure.
Sam, would you like to explain how that ad got in the paper?
How?
Sam.
Sweetheart, witchcraft got you into this mess.
I saw no reason why witchcraft shouldn't get you out of it.
Besides, we got a genuine Paul Revere teapot in the bargain.
Can we keep it?
Why not?
It was a gift from Sir Leslie.

{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
What are you doing?
Well, Larry called earlier.
He's all uptight about the Blakely account.
I told him I'd rough out some ideas and mail 'em in tomorrow.
Doesn't he know you're on vacation?
Oh, he knows.
But he doesn't care.
Oh.
Besides, if I do this preliminary work, it'll keep him from coming up here.
Hm.
Some vacation.
You're stuck here working, and I'm off to a meeting.
What's on the agenda?
Well, uh, tonight we install the new resident witch.
Resident witch?
Yes.
We've had one living here in Salem incognito ever since the witch-hunts of 1692, just to make sure it never happens again.
You know some of you witches aren't half bad.
Why don't we forget about work and conventions?
Let's think of this as a second honeymoon.
Mm.
I can get out of the meeting.
I'll tell them I came down with a very bad case of love.
As chairlady of the meeting, I would not consider it a proper excuse.
Why don't you ever knock, Endora?
And why don't you ever knock it off?
Come along, Samantha.
We'll be late.
I'll try not to wake you up when I get back.
Uh, you'd better wake me up or I'll never forgive you.
After a short recess we'll deal with the appointment of the new resident witch of Salem.
As you well know, this office was created out of the wisdom of the high priestess, Hepzibah the image of the witch.
And if necessary, through the use of witchcraft, to protect those innocent people who may be accused as witches.
As well as to protect against themselves those mortals so foolish as to cry: "Witch"!
This coven is now in recess.
I'm going to get a little bit of food.
Guess who.
Ha-ha.
Waldo.
Who else?
How did you guess?
The wart on your little finger.
From the time you turned me into a frog when we were children.
I'm sorry it never went away.
I'm not.
This foolish thing reminds me of you.
Waldo.
Grow up.
I'm happily married with two beautiful children.
Yeah, but to a mortal.
That doesn't count.
Silly.
Oh, excuse me.
I-I'm needed.
Fly into my nest My love Though you may be second best My love Though you're only make-believe My love At least you're mine this eve My love Wasn't very nice of her telling me to grow up.
But, Waldo, my darling, my love.
That's the thing I adore about you: your boyish quality.
That's better.
I love you, Waldo.
Do you love me?
Do I love thee?
Let me count the ways.
Let me count the ways.
One, like some kind of nut.
Two, like a case of arrested development.
Mother, you're intruding.
On a what?
On a nothing.
On a figment of your imagination.
It's my figment.
Please don't interfere.
She's air, Waldo.
You make her up in that sick brain of yours.
All these centuries, pining over one skinny witch.
I have a right to lead my own life.
Then lead it.
Do something.
I will.
I promise you.
Sweetheart?
Has room service come yet?
No, not yet.
Oh, dear.
I'm afraid I'm only gonna have time for a cup of coffee.
I thought the witching hour started at midnight.
Yes, well, huh, Mother put me on the Ways and Means Committee.
She's the chairman.
If she's the chairman, it should be called the Ways to be Mean Committee.
Room service!
Come in.
Now, you certainly took your time.
You don't like it, go back where you came from.
I tipped the waiter to let me do it.
Ha-ha.
Funny, huh?
I'll let you know in a minute.
What are you doing here?
Well, knowing that you'd be anxious to show me your progress on the Blakely account, I gladly sacrificed my time to come up here to see you.
But I thought we agreed yesterday that you weren't coming up.
That was yesterday.
We can't keep living in the past.
I-I don't quite follow that.
What he means is we can't keep living in the past because he's too busy bothering us in the present.
Now, here are the roughs of my presentation.
Take them back with my blessings.
Now, don't think I don't appreciate this, but who can do a better selling-job than the man who created these gems?
Sorry.
Oh, what's wrong with picking up a fat bonus while you're on vacation?
Blakely digs you.
He likes your kind of pizzazz.
I'm all pizzazzed out.
That's why I'm on vacation.
Sweetheart, if you'd really like to go back for just a day or two, I wouldn't mind.
It's that kind of loyalty that makes me proud to be an American.
Ah, you-- You fellas figure it out.
I have some family business.
Now, I'll meet you back here at 1:00 for lunch, okay?
Bye-bye, Larry.
Bye, Sam.
How about it, friend?
Oh, aren't you gonna eat anything after all the trouble I went to?
Nope.
I'm off to see the sights of Salem.
Now, that's what I mean.
Even the way you said that, it's got a ring to it.
Just a couple of days, Darrin.
For crying out-- You know, I've been learning a lot about early American history.
Now, isn't it fascinating that one of Nathaniel Hawthorne's ancestors actually presided at the Salem witchcraft trials?
Speaking of witchcraft, that's what it's going to take to save the Blakely account.
Get over there.
I'll take your picture with Roger Conant.
He led one of the first groups to settle in Salem in 1626.
That old boy goes way back.
What about our friendship?
That goes way back too.
Why don't you think about that?
Go on.
Take it.
You can call it, "Man Begging in Front of House of Seven Gables".
A half day.
Come back for one half day.
No.
This is my first vacation in four years, and you're not gonna bully me out of it or wheedle me out of it.
But now I mean it, Larry.
I am staying right here in Salem.
Period.
End of discussion.
Darrin, let's not beat around the bush.
I want a definite answer.
If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna buy some more film.
Fine.
I'll be waiting patiently.
I love you, Waldo.
I love you more than life itself.
Tell me more.
Don't think that I haven't paid the price in loneliness.
Perhaps we shouldn't be meeting like this.
We shouldn't?
But our lives are full of "shouldn'ts".
Can a star stop twinkling?
Can a bird stop singing?
Oh!
I'm sorry.
Where are you going?
There's supposed to be a grape arbor through there.
Well, they're out of season.
Uh, ju-- Just a lot of naked vines.
Let's get out of here.
Uh-- Boy, you're really upset, aren't you?
Upset?
Me?
Ha-ha.
About what?
About my refusing to help out with the Blakely account.
I'm sorry I made such a federal case out of it.
I'll go back if it's that important.
You will not.
You stick to your guns, boy.
You haven't had a vacation in four years, and you're not gonna let me bully you out of it or wheedle you out of it.
You're staying right here in Salem with Samantha.
And furthermore Perhaps if I met her husband and learned to hate him I could force myself to get rid of him.
Believe me, Darrin, I can handle the Blakely account.
You don't have to come back to New York.
I wonder what's keeping Sam.
Well, how should I know?
I mean, uh why'd you ask me that?
It was just a rhetorical question.
I-I didn't expect an answer.
Ah, here she is.
Hi, sweetheart.
Sorry I'm late.
Mwah.
Forgive me, Larry.
I'll try.
Another martini, please.
Oh.
Shopping in this town is impossible.
I thought you were visiting relatives.
That's why I was visiting relatives.
Talk, talk, talk.
Oh, I am ravenous.
Did you do a lot of sightseeing?
Enough.
More than enough.
What did you see?
What did I see?
Well, what do you see when you sightsee?
Sights.
Oh.
Yeah, well-- Hello, Samantha.
Oh.
Waldo.
Uh, Waldo, I'd like you to meet my husband.
This is Darrin.
How do you do?
This is Larry Tate.
How do you do?
I've heard so much about you, Darrin.
May I say that you are a very, very lucky man.
Oh, Waldo and I are old friends.
We practically grew up together.
Like brother and sister.
I'm sorry.
It just went down the wrong way.
Waldo, if you don't mind, we were just about to order lunch.
Splendid.
I'm famished.
Well isn't this cozy?
If you'll excuse me.
I don't feel very well.
I'm going up to my room and lie down.
Oh, I-I'm sorry, Larry.
Anything I can do?
I certainly hope so.
What's the matter with him?
I don't know.
He's just a bundle of nerves.
S-sweetheart maybe you should go up and see if he's all right.
Yeah, I guess so.
Excuse me.
Waldo.
What's the big idea, barging in?
I just wanted to meet your husband, see what you saw in him.
Now that you've met him?
What do you see in him?
Tsk.
Honestly.
Who is it?
It's Darrin.
Darrin, what are you doing up here?
You should be downstairs with them eating your lunch.
What for?
Well, I-- I-- I, uh-- Well, if you don't, a stranger's going to have to pick up our check.
Larry.
What's bothering you?
Bothering me?
Nothing's bothering me.
It's what's bothering you that's bothering me.
You're not making sense.
Okay.
Then here it is in a nutshell.
Yes?
I don't want to get involved.
In what?
Well, let's put it another way.
If Sam, for example, happened to run into an old friend like Waldo, for example, at the House of Seven Gables, for example, that doesn't necessarily mean what you think it means.
When did you see them there?
When we were sightseeing.
On the other hand, it could have been somebody that looked like her.
Why didn't I think of that before?
It was somebody that looked like her.
The light was bad, and I didn't see what I thought I saw.
So forget the whole thing.
Go down, enjoy your lunch.
Where you going?
I'm sure there's a simple explanation to whatever you saw so I'm gonna take your advice and finish my lunch.
Are you ready for lunch?
Waldo, I can't have lunch with you.
I really should go upstairs.
And remember, none of your tricks.
My mother won't like it, but I promise you, Samantha, none of my tricks.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
Good afternoon.
Good afternoon.
Waiter, two more of the same, please.
So her husband is decent and loving.
What about me?
You are intelligent and sensitive and vibrant.
That's much better than being decent and loving.
Then shall we away to our rendezvous?
You're not "awaying" anyplace.
I want a full explanation of what's going on here, or I'm gonna bust-- Oh, stop crowing.
I'm sorry, Samantha, but I do detest violence.
You had to protect yourself.
That does it.
I quit.
But, Larry, if Darrin left your room five minutes ago, where did he go?
He's not in our room.
Well, maybe it's just as well.
Ah, he wasn't very hungry anyway.
What?
Uh, nothing.
Larry, how are you feeling?
Oh, my-- My throat's still bothering me a little.
But, uh don't worry about me, Sam.
I'll be all right.
Well, is there anything I can do to help?
Just, uh, be good to each other.
Well, uh, we'll certainly try.
Uh, bye.
Darrin.
Darrin, is that you?
Oh, you poor dear.
I-I-- I don't blame you for being upset.
A-and somebody is gonna pay for this, believe me.
Mother!
Darrin.
Darrin.
Well, uh, don't be mad at me.
I had nothing to do with it.
I-I-I'm sorry, sweetheart.
But I-- I only did that for your own good.
Believe me.
Now, you be patient.
And tonight at the convention, I'll get to the bottom of this.
And now for my next encore I should like to recite one of the loveliest incantations of our literature: The spell to bring on an April shower.
Try this for an encore, Mother.
Please, Samantha.
I work alone.
Oh, come on.
Show them how clever you are.
Oh, stop waving that ridiculous bird at me-- Don't you call my husband a ridiculous bird.
That's Durwood?
Oh-ho.
How perfectly divine.
Well, I am not amused.
Now, put him back the way you found him.
I didn't do it, sweetheart.
Not that I wouldn't have, had I thought of it.
Well, then who did?
I don't know.
But whoever it was, let's have an ovation for him.
Yes!
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
All of you!
You call yourselves decent witches?
Bullies, that's what you are!
Where's your sense of humor, Samantha?
It's just a little convention high jinks.
We're no worse than the Shriners or the Elks.
Well, I don't think it's funny.
And I want whoever did it to undo it.
Pronto!
Well, what--?
Well, what happened?
Where did they go?
Uh, I-I'm sorry, sweetheart, but, uh, they consider this hallowed ground.
Andwell, you're a-- I know what I am.
Now get me back to the hotel on the double.
Uh, yes, Darrin.
What are you doing?
What I was doing when I was a bird.
Except faster.
Don't you think I deserve an explanation?
This afternoon, Larry saw you and Waldo the warlock at the House of Seven Gables.
Waldo and me?
That's impossible.
I don't wanna talk about it anymore.
And I'll go home, cool off and forgive you.
In a year or two.
Maybe.
And you're not even going to demand an explanation?
Okay.
I demand an explanation.
That's better.
Well, go on.
Explain.
I can't.
B-but I know someone who can.
Waldo?
Waldo.
Front and center.
I was expecting your call.
First, may I apologize for the bird business?
Thanks.
From the bottom of my beak.
Waldo, rumor hath it that you and I were seen cavorting at the House of Seven Gables today.
Now, I'm gonna ask you nicely to explain that rumor quickly, or I will zap you into another century.
All right.
I was going to explain anyway.
Sir.
You have your Samantha and I have mine.
Real to nobody but myself.
Heh.
It's a foolish fantasy, I know.
But I assure you, a harmless one.
Oh, Waldo.
It's been almost an hour since I've seen you.
I've been so lonesome and sad.
Oh, I love you so, Waldo.
I love you with all my heart and soul.
I love you-- All right.
All right.
That's enough.
Who's that?
Sam.
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I'm not.
You're beautiful when you're jealous.
I knocked, but nobody answered.
Oh, Waldo.
I love you more than life itself.
I'm sorry, Sam.
But this is something I have to do.
Waldo.
Can't you do anything but crows?
Shall I put him back the way he was?
Not yet.
How will we explain this to Larry?
Well, sweetheart, we have a choice.
We could tell him I was having a mad, impetuous fling.
Sure.
Or we could tell him I'm a witch.
Yeah, that would be terrific.
Or we could tell him that was Serena he saw.
That will do it.
Okay, Waldo.
Let's have a Serena.
Must I, Samantha?
I'm not very fond of your cousin.
Oh, please, Waldo.
A-- A blond Serena dressed just like this.
Like your fantasy Samantha.
Well, that's easier.
Yeah.
That's good enough.
Now do him.
What happened?
Uh, well, uh, y-you led with a right cross.
And, uh-- And-- And Waldo countered with a karate chop.
He's a very dangerous uh, person, you know.
I didn't feel a thing.
That's what makes him so dangerous.
I didn't realize before.
You know something?
When you're knocked out, you dream.
I thought I was a crow.
Where is he?
I may be down but I'm not out.
I'm sorry for the little misunderstanding, sir.
Oh.
May I present my friend, Serena?
Hi, cotton top.
Serena, your-- Your hair.
Someone said blonds have more fun.
I thought I'd find out.
Hm-hm.
Oh, Serena.
It was you all the time.
And I thought that-- A perfectly understandable mistake.
Hm.
And you proved your loyalty.
Uh, where have you two girls been?
To a costume ball?
That's right.
Serena.
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you.
I don't feel very good.
Could somebody bring me a drink?
How about some Old Crow?

{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
Adam wants to say good night.
Mwah.
Sleep tight till morning bright.
I don't know, Adam.
What did he say?
Don't you understand baby talk?
Heh.
No.
I have enough trouble with grownup talk.
He wants to know when Mommy and Daddy are coming home.
In another week.
Which won't be too soon for me.
You all right?
I think so.
Well, I'm sorry about that flock of geese we ran into.
I didn't see them.
Well, in the first place, it wouldn't hurt if you looked where you were flying.
And in the second place, we shouldn't have been flying in the first place.
Darrin, when you said you wanted to come home right now, I believed you.
I didn't mean I wanted to fly the proud witch with the golden nose.
The nerve of that crackpot Witches Council.
Ordering you not to be seen in public with me.
Well, I didn't like it any more than you did.
What are you doing home?
Oh, hi, Esmeralda.
Hi, Esmeralda.
I thought the witches convention wasn't over till next week.
Did they cut it short?
No.
I cut it short.
Are the, uh, children asleep?
Oh.
I was just about to put them down.
Uh, Adam's still in Tabitha's room.
Thank you.
Oh, my.
She's put out, isn't she?
Well, she got into a hassle with the Witches Council.
Well, I don't think that's so smart.
Nobody defies the Council.
Well, I'd better have a little talk with her.
I mean "fuel".
Or do I?
Oh, dear.
"To Samantha, from the Witches Council: "You are hereby ordered to return to Salem "within 60 seconds of receiving this Witch-O-Gram or suffer the consequences".
Oh, dear.
I knew it.
I just knew it.
I've gotta give this to her right away.
But-- But what if she doesn't obey?
Oh, well.
Well, she can't be that stubborn.
Who says she can't?
Oh, dear.
I've already used up with myself.
Esmeralda, you've got to send her back to Salem whether she wants to go or not.
Oh, dear.
Maybe I can figure out a spell that will do the trick.
Let me see.
Boy, Sam, has he grown.
Did you bring me anything, Mommy?
Oh, you mean besides Daddy?
Yes.
But you'll have to wait till we unpack.
Well, I've got something for you.
Oh, yes.
Ah.
Souvenirs of Salem.
What have you got for me?
You can have one of these, Daddy.
Mwah.
Where's Mrs. Stephens?
Gee, I don't know.
She was right there a second ago.
Oh, my goodness.
It worked.
It worked.
What are you talking about?
First, will you promise not to get mad?
Okay, okay.
I sent Mrs. Stephens back to Salem.
You did what?
You broke your promise.
Who art thou?
I-I-I don't know.
Why dost thee wander the streets in thine undergarments?
I-I-I don't seem to remember that either.
Come inside before thou art arrested.
Arrested?
For what?
Indecent exposure.
Esmeralda, I know you were only trying to help, but don't you think you should have consulted Mrs. Stephens?
There wasn't time.
The Council gave her 60 seconds to get back to Salem, and I knew there was no use arguing, so I just cast the spell.
It's the first one that's worked in years.
That's what's got me worried.
Endora believe it or not, I am genuinely glad to see you.
I wish I could say the same for you.
Where is Samantha?
Oh, Endora, you don't have to worry about a thing.
I cast a spell and sent her back to Salem.
You did what?
Oh.
That's exactly what he said.
You mean, she didn't show up in Salem?
Well, if she had, would I have come after her?
Oh, dear.
Esmeralda.
Wait, wait.
Wait.
Before you fade out what was the spell you used?
Ohuh From hoot and holler Coot and fern Flies in the buttermilk Flies in the churn The Council orders you Not to fail them So back you go To good old Salem Aha.
Aha, what?
Well, isn't it obvious?
She sent her back to old Salem.
What--?
What "old Salem" are you talking about?
Seventeenth-century Salem, naturally.
Y-y-you don't mean the one between the 16th century and the 18th century?
That's the one.
Don't fret, Esmeralda.
It's all his fault.
My fault?
Oh, dear.
I hate violence.
I'll be in the nursery.
And I'm due back at the convention.
Uh, but what about Sam?
You'll go back to old Salem and rescue her.
Me?
Yes.
While I go back and smooth the ruffled feathers of the Council.
But I can't go back to old-- Well, it's either you or Esmeralda.
What time do I leave?
Well, first First, you'll need a magic charm to restore Samantha's witchcraft.
You mean, she's without her witchcraft?
That's right.
Terrific.
Old Salem is just the place for a witch without witchcraft.
She'll be all right as soon as you give her this.
It's a magic coin from the tomb of Hammurabi.
Samantha must place it on her forehead and bow three times to the east, without dropping the coin, and say the magic phrase: Ahmed talu varsi lupin.
W-wait a minute.
How is she gonna bow without dropping the coin?
That's your problem.
That's impossible.
Well, if it was easy, anyone could do it.
Yeah, uh-- What was that magic phrase?
You have the retentive powers of a dodo bird.
Ahmed talu varsi lupin.
What does that mean?
"Good luck".
In ancient Babylonian.
Next, you'll need some contemporary plumage.
Uh, there's one other thing.
Samantha has no memory of the present, so she won't know you, of course.
Uh, of course.
What?
Well, how could she?
You haven't been born yet.
You mean I'll be a perfect stranger to my wife?
Well, stranger, yes.
But hardly perfect.
Oh, by the by, throw in a lot of "thees" and "thous".
It was considered very chic in 1690.
Nowstand over there.
Days become seconds Seconds become night Into the past With the speed of light Ice turns hot Fire turns cold Send dum-dum back To Salem of old Uh, what are you being punished for?
I spoke sharply to my husband.
That's all?
These were the good old days.
Well.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's better, mistress.
Thou art most kind.
I've been thinking.
Perhaps we can employ this unfortunate girl as barmaid.
A pint of ale, if it please ye.
And if not, I'll have one anyway.
No need to shout, Master Luther.
Well, and what be thy name, wench?
She hath lost her memory and hath forgotten her name.
I knoweth one thing.
It is not "wench" Well.
She's a spirited little bundle, ain't she?
Uh, what's the news, Master Luther?
Oh.
Uh, I heard tell, uh, Master Carson's wife be arrested and jailed.
What for?
For being a witch.
But not yet tried.
She be as good as convicted.
Oh, that's terrible.
Shh-shh.
Guard thy speech.
Well partial to witches, is she?
She said no such thing.
I-I just mean that everyone is entitled to a fair trial.
Even a wife.
Uh, mistress, uh, take these two tankards to the far table.
I'll help thee.
Thy words contain much sense.
I may have lost my memory, but I haven't lost my mind.
Ooh.
Sam.
It's me, Sam.
Is thy name Sam?
No.
Look, I know you don't know who I am, b-but it won't hurt to talk.
It will if thee talketh with thine hands.
Uh, where can I get a pencil?
Uh, where can thee get a what?
Sorry.
Wrong century.
Greetings, Master Farley.
Greetings, sir.
Uh, greetings.
Greetings, friends.
Greetings.
Magistrate.
This man at the bar that you see there Uh, take this coin and do what I tell you.
Uh, why did you do that?
Just because I am a barmaid doesn't mean thee can take liberties with me.
Sir, I'm going to ask thee to leave these premises.
But I haven't done anything.
I will be the judge of that.
Who are you?
The judge.
I do not know where thou came from, for thy speech is strange.
But in this town, we do not permit lewd conduct.
Oh, I'm afraid there's been a misunderstanding.
I-- Indeed, there has been.
But a day in the stocks will serve to clarify things for thee, master.
A day in the what?
The stocks?
Oh, now, listen, you gotta let me explain-- Take him away!
What are you doing?
Don't I get a hearing?
I demand to see a lawyer.
Let go of me!
Hi.
What are you mad about?
I'm the one that had to stand out here all night.
I'm sorry.
I don't like to see people suffer.
How am I gonna get through to you?
Sam, look at me.
Think.
Search your memory.
Don't you remember me?
Of course.
You do?
Yes.
Thou art the person who tried to get fresh with me yesterday.
Here.
Take back thy coin.
Hey, wait.
What is it?
I could use some of that water.
Oh.
Very well.
Hast thou had enough?
Oh.
Plague on it.
I've broken my quill.
Oh.
And we've no other.
Oh, what a shame.
Oh, umhere.
Use this.
What manner of a device is this?
As I recall it is a ballpoint quill.
Ballpoint quill?
It needeth no ink.
That cannot be.
Try it.
It is truly amazing.
May I see that, Master Farley?
It is a product of witchcraft, surely.
Saints preserve us.
Did I not tell thee she was a witch?
Seize her!
Why dost thou accuse me of witchery, when it was the stranger who gave me this curious quill?
The stranger be accused as well.
Aye.
Aye.
How can you eat this stuff?
You must dip the bread in the honey.
I did.
The only thing worse than old bread is sticky old bread.
We've gotta get out of this place.
How?
With this coin.
How can a coin help?
It's a magic coin.
Then thou art a witch.
It is the devil's coin.
That's no way to talk about your mother.
Fetch the prisoners and bring them to the witch house.
They're coming.
Uh, we've gotta get out of here.
Uh, catch.
Well, master.
It is time.
Both must wear shackles.
Uh, hold on a minute.
I just wanna get the coin I dropped.
Believe me, where thou art doomed to go thou will have little need for money.
You've gotta listen to me.
These nuts burn witches.
Thou art wrong.
We hang them.
Oh.
That's comforting.
Admit to witchcraft, or it'll go hard with ye.
Ye will be hanged for refusing to confess.
And if we do confess?
Then you'll be hanged for being witches.
Are you getting the picture?
Custer had a better chance than we do.
Who's Custer?
Forget it.
And then she draws that strange quill from her pocket and hands it to Master Farley.
At once I knew it to be an instrument of the devil.
How so?
It had an unholy glow about it.
That is absolute nonsense.
The court will decide what is nonsense and what is not.
A simple "sit down" will do.
And then she says, says she: "Everybody's entitled to a fair trial.
Even a witch".
I said, "Even a wife".
If it pleaseth the court I wish to confess.
Come forward, master.
Thou art dismissed.
Thou art ready to state that thou art a witch?
Uh, not me.
Her.
The poor child.
I warned thee not to trust him.
Thou wast right.
He is a rat in wolf's clothing.
With this coin I will demonstrate that she is a sorceress.
Do as he asks.
Face the east.
Do not heed him.
He is allied with the devil.
There is something in his manner that touches my memory.
And I must obey.
Take this coin, place it on your forehead and bow three times.
But the coin will fall off.
No, it won't.
It's covered with honey.
Bow three times and say: Uh, ahmed talu, varsi, lupin.
What does that mean?
"Good luck".
And we could sure use some.
Ahmed talu varsi lupin.
Darrin!
Sam!
Let's get out of here.
Not yet.
It is true.
I am a witch.
But I am going to prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that none of the others-- none of those accused --actually were witches.
And what is the basis for this absurd contention?
Do you think that mere iron shackles could contain me?
Now, how can mortals prosecute creatures who can transform themselves.
Who can cause fire, flood and storm?
How can you imprison someone who can vanish before your very eyes?
Art thou done?
Yes.
It is thy contention that a witch can vanish, yet thou dost not vanish.
No.
And why not?
To make us believe thou art not a witch.
Yet that what thou hath proved instead is that thou art a witch.
For who but a witch would be cunning enough not to display her powers?
Seize them and return them to the jail.
Now, uh, for my next trick.
And just in case that doesn't convince you watch this.
What a ham.
Now do you understand?
The people that you persecuted were guiltless.
They were mortals, just like yourselves.
You are the guilty.
It is the recommendation of the court that we all repair to our homes and reflect carefully on the illusions that we have seen and heard this day.
And then have a pint of ale and forget that it ever happened.
Ready for takeoff?
Let us attribute these hallucinations to our own witch hysteria.
And I hereby decree an end to these and future trials.
Sam?
Good morning.
Mrs. Stephens said to tell you that she had to go out, but she wouldn't be gone long.
What would you like for brunch?
I don't know.
What can you make without causing a disaster?
Fortunately, I know you like to joke, so I don't resent that.
How about an omelette?
Okay.
Maybe a nice Spanish omelette?
Fine, fine.
Uh, wait a minute.
W-we are talking about an omelette made with chicken eggs.
We are?
All right.
If that's the way you want it.
Oh, boy.
I'm tired.
It's the time change from the 17th to the 20th century.
Where have you been?
I had a little unfinished business with the Witches Council, remember?
That's right.
What happened?
Good news.
I don't have to go back to Salem.
That's terrific.
How come?
I pointed out to them that in their own way they're just as bad as the people behind the original witch hunts.
And their attitude toward our marriage is just as prejudiced and bigoted.
You know something?
You're a good little infighter.
You mean I'm effective in the clinches?
Yeah.
Brunch is on!
Mm.
Mm-hm.
She's making a Spanish omelette.
Oh.
That should be interesting.
How do you feel about a plain omelette with Spanish on the side?
That's interesting.

{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
Oh.
Morning, sweetheart.
What time did you finally come to bed last night?
Around 3:30, I guess.
Right after I read, The Encyclopedia of Dogs uh, Dogs Through History, The Care and Feeding of Your Dog, and Lassie, Come Home.
You read all those, huh?
Wow.
Or, uh, should I say "bow-wow"?
Ha-ha.
Just a little canine quickie.
Actually, I'm very impressed.
I guess I am something of an instant dog expert.
Did you know there are over of dogs?
Really?
Is that counting you, Dogwood?
My oatmeal just curdled.
I wonder why.
I'm sorry, Durwood, but I expected you to be at the office, scratching out a living.
It's after 11, you know.
Time for the rats to be in the race.
Sam I'm declaring this backyard a disaster area.
Will you please remove the disaster?
Durwood, let me say to you what I said to Columbus on his first voyage.
Get lost.
Gladly.
Bye, sweetheart.
Samantha, my dearest.
Mm-hm?
You'll never, never guess  who I ran into this morning.
The front four of the Kansas City Chiefs?
Oh, be serious.
It was Ashley Flynn.
Mother uh, how long did you have to search before you, quote, "ran into Ashley"?
It was a complete accident.
Mm-hm.
Why, thank you, Endora.
Samantha you're more beautiful than ever.
The only one that got away.
Uh.
I didn't get away, Ashley.
I was never hooked.
A-and what are you doing here?
I swooped down on gossamer wings to rescue my lovely bird from this domestic cage.
I don't need any rescuing.
But you do.
You're right.
I'll leave you two young people alone.
Oh, uh, M-Mother, don't go anywhere.
Ta-ta.
Mother!
Samantha Uh-- why don't you let me take you away from this grubby mortal existence?
If I tell you, will you leave?
Perhaps.
Because I think you're obnoxious.
One of those love-hate things, huh?
It's okay.
I-- I'm crazy about complex relationships.
Well, I'm not.
Oh.
I'd forgotten how lovely you are.
Samantha, even a pushy warlock like me can take that kind of hint.
I'll leave.
Good idea.
This, uh, husband of yours, he-- He must be something quite special for a mortal.
I'd like to meet him sometime.
I doubt it.
You move in different circles.
Wellciao.
Sothe square and I move in different circles.
Hm.
We'll see what kind of circles he moves in.
I believe the basset hound originated in France, Mr. Gibbons, in the 17th century.
Right again, Stephens.
Well, for heaven's sake, where did you learn so much about dogs?
Dogs.
That's all Darrin ever thinks or talks about.
Uh-huh.
That's the kind of in-depth product knowledge you'll be getting at McMann and Tate, Mr. Gibbons.
Ah, very impressive.
But I'm interested not only in knowledge from an ad agency, but also in character.
Well, I can vouch for that.
Darrin is the kind of man-- Most people judge a man by the company he keeps.
I judge a man by the dog he keeps.
Really?
Yes.
Now, 'course just a guess, Tate, but I would say that your dog has a lot of, oh, nervous energy.
Probably a large white poodle, hm?
Actually, I don't have a dog.
You don't have a dog?
I can't.
I live in an apartment house that doesn't allow pets.
But I'm like a second father to Darrin's dog.
What kind of a dog is it?
Beagle.
Sheepdog.
You saidsheepdog, and you said beagle.
Uh, which one is it?
Well, you know, it's, uh, kind of a mixture.
Heh-heh.
I'll say.
Well, does it have long hair or short hair?
Long.
Short.
Long.
Short.
Are you two talking about the same dog?
Certainly.
Heh.
It has short hair in the front and long hair in the back.
Stephens, that is exactly the kind of dog I would have guessed you had.
It-- It's sort of, uh, brown all over, e-except, uh, it has a white spot around one eye and a black spot around the other eye.
Plus, i-it's got kind of a goatee.
No kidding?
When can I see it?
See it?
But I thought you were flying back home today.
I am, but my plane doesn't leave until midnight.
I've got plenty of time later on.
Oh, but I live w-way out in, uh, W-Westport, Mr. Gibbons.
It's a terrible drive.
Anyway, when you've seen one mutt, you've seen them all.
You, uh You fellows aren't putting me on, are you?
I-- There is a dog?
Of course there's a dog.
And you're going to see it if you really want to.
I want to.
Fine.
Fine.
Then, uh, why don't you meet me here, say, around, uh, 5:00?
We'll drive out to Stephens' and, uh see the dog.
And have cocktails, right, Darrin?
Right.
I'm sure we'll all be ready for a drink by then.
Terrific.
A sheepdog-beagle.
I can hardly wait.
Come on, Darrin.
Let's go down to the pound and get a dog.
Larry, were you listening to yourself when you described my dog?
You're not gonna find one like that ever, anyplace.
Forget it.
Look, Darrin, you can't quit on me now.
This whole thing is your fault anyway.
My fault?
Sure.
If you were normal and had a dog like everybody else, I wouldn't have been forced to invent one for you.
Oh, that reminds me.
Uh, since when did you and Louise move out of your house and into an apartment that doesn't allow dogs?
Oh, that.
Well, I love dogs, but I'm allergic to them.
Well, come on.
You're wasting time.
All right.
You're too old to be fraternity boys.
What is it, an election bet?
Please, will you just let us take one look at the dogs?
Okay.
But you're not gonna find what you described.
I personally check every dog that comes into this pound.
If there had been a dog with short hair in the front long hair in the back a white spot and a black spot and a beard-- Where did that dog come from?
Darrin, it's perfect.
You're right.
I don't know how I could have missed a dog like that.
I wanna thank you for reuniting man and his best friend.
Maybe the barking's getting to me.
Come on, boy.
Sam!
Hi, sweetheart.
Oh.
Y-you got a dog?
He's a gift from Larry, to impress Mr. Gibbons, our dog food client.
Oh.
My goodness.
He certainly is an affectionate little thing, isn't he?
He seems crazy about you.
Where's Tabitha?
Oh, well, she's at the movies with Esmeralda.
Oh, it'll be such a surprise for her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Are you hungry?
You want something to eat?
Oh.
Why, yes.
Well, now, wait a minute.
Come on.
I think you've made a conquest, Sam.
I've never seen a dog take to anyone that fast.
I have just the thing for you: some of Adam's baby food.
Strained calves' liver and turnips.
You're gonna love it.
That's funny.
That's the same reaction I get from Adam.
I'll see if I can find an old blanket for him to sleep on.
Here we go.
Come on.
Come on.
Yum-yum-yum.
Yum-yum.
Here we go.
Well, m-maybe you'd like some water.
Tsk.
Okay.
Who's the wise witch in the dog suit?
Mother?
Uncle Arthur?
Don't give me any of your dog tricks.
Whoever is in there better identify themselves.
Eww.
A-and stop all that kissing.
That doesn't fool me one-- Ashley!
Ashley, it's you!
I know you're in there, Ashley.
Under all that funny-looking dog is a rotten warlock.
What do you mean, you were curious?
That's no reason to go down to Darrin's office and spy on him.
He is?
Oh, uh-- Uh, hi, sweetheart.
Sam.
Hm?
What's going on here?
Darrin that is no ordinary dog.
Well, that is certainly obvious.
A-and you are entitled to the truth.
He's an old friend.
That dog is an old friend?
That's right.
Would you mind introducing me to your old friend?
Uh, certainly.
Ashley this is Darrin.
How do you do, Ashley?
Sam, I feel ridiculous.
So do I. Sam, who is this?
Uh, this is Ashley.
Should I introduce you again?
No.
Uh, just tell me what he's doing here.
Now, look, pal.
There's nothing to get excited about.
I was just passing by, and I wanted to meet the paragon of virtue who finally captured Samantha.
I see.
But why as a dog?
W-well, uh, when I dropped down to your office, I found you in that, uh, little charade with your client.
You needed a dog.
And I thought I'd help out.
Well, you can't argue with that, sweetheart.
Thanks, Ashley, for helping me out.
Now, would you mind helping yourself out of my life?
I'll get that.
You take care of this.
Hello?
Darrin.
Mr. Gibbons is waiting for me in the reception room.
We'll be leaving in a minute.
Be sure to have plenty of the client's product on hand, get it?
Uh, y-you'd better not come, Larry.
The-- The dog isn't here.
Where is he?
He, uh, ran away.
Well, search the neighborhood.
That dog can't be hard to spot.
Now, find that dog.
Are you still here?
Oh.
Who was that on the phone?
Larry.
He's on his way over with the client to see that cute dog your warlock used to be.
Well, uh, there's only one solution to this.
He wanted to be a dog.
Ha-ha.
Well, you got your wish.
Oh, hush, Ashley.
You invaded this house as a dog, and you stuck your wet, black nose into everything.
Now, you're just gonna stay a dog until things get straightened out.
You mean, he'll stay that way?
Yeah, until I change him back.
Besides, he owes us this.
You understand, don't you, Ashley?
Good.
Oh, Sam, I've got to run to the market and pick up a case of Gibbons Dog Burgers.
I'll be right back.
H-how come you can do that to a warlock?
I caught him by surprise.
Hm.
Stop that.
Heh.
Hi, Mrs. Stephens.
Hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
I-I-- I was wondering if I could borrow some, um, uh, paprika.
Oh, of course.
Uh, I-I see you have a new doggy.
He, uh sure is interesting-looking.
Interesting?
Uh, well, maybe that's the wrong word.
Mrs. Stephens, I hope you don't mind, but that dog is ugly.
Take it easy, Ashley.
No.
I am not going to let you out of this house.
You wouldn't.
You would!
Okay.
You win.
I'll let you out.
But you have to promise not to bite her.
Nod your head.
A-and I have your word you won't run away.
Okay.
Come on.
Remember, you promised.
Yes?
You call this ferocious?
I think he's kind of cute.
Here, poochy.
Come on.
Cute?
He's the ugliest dog I've ever seen.
Oh.
You come back here!
You come back!
Abner!
Abner, help!
The-- The dog.
He's turned into a giant!
Giant, huh?
Is he jolly and green?
Hurry up!
That's a giant?
I know what I saw!
And I know what I'm gonna get: your medicine.
Abner!
Now it's a beagle!
Let me know when it becomes Rin Tin Tin.
He's my favorite.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Kravitz, I'm sorry to bother you.
But I was wondering-- Oh.
There you are, you naughty dog.
Mrs. Stephens, first, your dog came in, Then it was a sheepdog.
Then your dog.
Then it was a beagle.
My goodness.
It sounds like you've had a regular dog show over here.
No!
They were all that dog.
Okay, Ashley.
Come on.
You got even with Mrs. Kravitz.
Now, I want you to stay down here and behave yourself.
I have to go up and check on Adam.
I had to go out and get another case of Gibbons Dog Burgers.
Just can't seem to keep enough of it in the house.
Ha-ha-ha.
Is he back?
With bells on.
Ashley!
Oh!
Hi.
Uh, hello.
Uh, Mr. Gibbons, may I present my wife, Samantha.
How do you do?
The pleasure is mine, Mrs. Stephens.
I've heard so much about you Oh.
and even more about that unusual dog of yours.
Where-- Where is he?
Oh, he-- He's around here somewhere.
Uh, can I get you gentlemen a drink?
Yes, I am a little parched.
Uh, I'll have-- But first, I want to see that pooch.
Will you bring him in, Sam?
Is that the dog?
I guess so.
Sounds like he's in trouble.
The closet.
Oh, it's locked.
Stephens, do you always lock your dog in the closet?
Oh, of course not, Mr. Gibbons.
I-I just-- I-- I think Ashley probably wandered in there by mistake and got locked in.
Ashley?
Tate, you certainly did not exaggerate.
That's a most unusual-looking dog.
Is he friendly?
Oh, sure.
He's a real pussycat.
Here.
Uh-- Uh, nice doggy.
Tate, are you trying to get me mauled?
What's wrong with that dog?
Nothing.
He's just a little nervous.
He acts like you beat him.
Ashley, you gave me your word.
What did he say?
Well, uh, Darrin is so close to Ashley, that he actually talks to him.
And Ashley had better listen.
Tate, if a man can't get along with his own dog, he certainly can't handle my advertising.
Let's go.
Uh, Mr. Gibbons-- Uh, Mr. Gibbons, please, uh, don't leave.
Why not?
Uh, b-because-- We-- Because we haven't given Ashley his Gibbons Dog Burger yet.
Oh, sure.
That's what's wrong with him.
He's hungry.
Ha-ha.
Well, I guess that's possible.
Uh, sweetheart, why don't we go into the kitchen and open this together?
Oh.
Right.
Heh.
We both like to do it.
What are they gonna do, play tug of war?
I think Ashley is turning into Benedict Arnold.
But I have a plan.
This should bring Ashley out of hiding.
Come on, Ashley.
Time for your Gibbons Dog Burger.
Ah.
That's more like it.
A T-bone steak?
What happened to the dog food?
That's what everyone will be saying, Mr. Gibbons.
"What happened to dog food"?
And we'll be able to say, "Gibbons T-Bones".
But people can't afford steak for dogs.
I-it won't be steak.
It'll be a Gibbons Dog Burger formed in the shape of a steak, with a Gibbons Chewy Bone right in the middle.
Oh, come on, Darrin.
That's ridiculous.
But intriguing.
Right.
A ridiculously intriguing idea.
Oh.
Ho-ho-ho.
What changed him?
Oh, well, that's part of Darrin's presentation.
You see, we-- We have trained Ashley to hold back his enthusiasm until he gets his T-bone.
I'm sold, Stephens.
The only thing I don't quite understand, is when you changed the Gibbons Burger for the T-bone steak.
You didn't notice that?
Neither did I. Oh, w-well, that's very easily explained.
Uh, you see, the, um, hand being quicker than the eye, we-- We just changed it before you, uh, were aware of it.
But actually, for the commercials, it'll be done with mirrors.
You understand?
Of course.
That's the way I figured you did it.
How else?
Well, it looks like I've gained a new product, and you have gained a new client, Darrin.
Oh, great, Charlie.
I hope all your presentations go just as smoothly as this one.
Goodbye, Samantha.
Goodbye, Mr. Gibbons.
Goodbye.
Ha-ha.
It was quite a cliffhanger, but you pulled it off.
You and Ashley.
Uh, say, Larry.
I noticed you weren't allergic to this dog.
I would be if I had to look at him much longer.
Well, Ashley, every dog has his day.
A-and you've had yours, so Oh.
Well, that feels better.
It was getting a little cramped in there.
Uh, would you explain why you suddenly decided to be the-- The good little puppy dog?
Uh, well, uh, you and Durwood out-tricked me fair and square, so I decided to come over to your side.
You're all heart, Ashley.
And the name is Darrin.
Then why does everybody call you "Durwood"?
Oh.
Heh.
Hello, Mother.
What are you doing here?
Well, I just wanted to see how things were going.
Swimmingly, I hope?
I should say.
Ashley saved the day.
If it hadn't been for him, Darrin never would've gotten the account.
You'll double-cross anyone, won't you, Ashley?
Certainly.
Let's go somewhere and have a drink on it.
Delighted.
Come on, Ashley.
Well, sweetheart, no more pooch.
What are we gonna do with all that dog food?
I know.
Why don't we trade it in on a muzzle for your mother?
Darrin!
You don't even know her size.
adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Mother, what are you doing in there?
I want to talk to you.
Is, uh, what's-his-name around?
What's-his-n-- Uh, Darrin is playing golf.
Good.
Ooh!
But he'll be home soon.
Oh, that's bad because I have an invitation from your old friend Rollo to join us at the Cosmos Cotillion for the costume ball to end all costume balls.
Well, it-- It sounds fascinating, Mother, but I have more important things to do.
Like what?
Well, I have to peel the potatoes, chop the onions, slice the carrots and season my leg of lamb.
Ugh.
Samantha, I have failed you as a mother.
Mother.
I did it.
I did it.
Hooray!
Sam, I did it.
I-- Oh.
Hi.
S-Sam, you'll-- You'll never believe-- You'll never believe this, but I-I've finally broken through.
Isn't the expression "broken out"?
Sam, I finally broke 80.
Oh, sweetheart, that's terrific.
Eighty what?
Oh, n-nothing, Mother.
Oh.
I'll tell you about it after your mother leaves.
Oh, and Endora, no offense, but I think you need a shave.
Ooh.
Mother, please.
Oh.
Samantha, forgive me, but when I think of what you gave up to marry a man who spends his Sundays breaking 80 nothings, I could cry.
That's only because the creature is still a novelty.
I'll be happy with him if I live to be 3000.
You can change your mind many times in 3000 years, Samantha.
Heaven knows I did.
But what about 30 years from now, when whatever dubious charms he has wrinkle up?
Mother, will you do me a favor?
Go to your ball, give Rollo my best, and let me see to my dinner.
You'll see more than to your dinner.
What's that supposed to me--?
M-Mother?
Mother?
Odds plus odds Add up to evens Let the curse be On Durwood Stephens Make the future be the present And zing it To the dum-dum peasant Samantha!
Sweetheart, what is it?
What's the--?
Ah!
Well.
Say something.
Oh, Mother.
Is that all you can say?
You look, uh, very handsome.
Uh, for your age.
Oh.
Sam, this is absolutely and without question the most abominable, most atrocious trick your mother has ever pulled on me.
Oh, be patient, sweetheart.
I'm trying to get her back.
Brock of owl's eye Smerge of eel-- Will you stop with the corny incantations and do something?
Well, there's nothing I can do.
She's the only-- I don't want excuses.
I want the old me back.
I mean the young me.
Darrin, I know how angry you are with-- My feelings for your mother go beyond anger.
Now, I mean, anyone who could do this thing is sick.
I can't believe it.
You know, actually, you carry your age very well.
Thanks a lot.
At least I still got my own teeth.
Darrin, will you stop looking at yourself?
I'm trying.
Now, you have got to get your mind off yourself.
Let's go to a nice, dark movie.
Well, suppose we meet somebody in the nice, bright lobby?
How about a drive-in movie?
I guess anything's better than waiting around here.
But didn't we have a date to play bridge with the Tates?
I'll get us out of it.
Darrin.
I'm sorry.
There will be a 10-minute intermission before the start of the main feature.
The refreshment stand is now open.
I'll go get us some-- You'll go get us some hot dogs.
Your aunt.
Why couldn't you take her to the movies?
Because these drive-ins are crawling with mashers.
You should be so lucky.
Funny.
I don't know how I'm gonna sit through that movie again.
I hated it the first time.
Excuse me.
Oh.
Oh.
Hi there.
Hello, Sam.
If you didn't want to play bridge, you should've said so.
You didn't have to make up that story about Darrin being sick.
Oh, but he is.
Well-- Well, he was asleep.
Uh, so I just decided to go out.
Well, uh, s-somebody dropped in from-- From out of town.
And as long as Darrin was asleep Well, uh, these hot dogs are getting cold.
Bye.
Well, well, well, well.
She leaves a sick husband and goes to a drive-in with somebody who just dropped in from out of town.
Darrin, here.
Let's go.
Where?
To see who her date is.
You'll never guess who I ran into.
Oh, I can guess.
Hi there.
Oh, well, uh-- H-Hi, again.
Oh, I-I'd like you to meet-- Darrin's grandfather, Grover.
Grover Stephens.
This is Louise and Larry Tate.
Larry is Darrin's boss.
Oh.
Howdy, kids.
W-What you staring at, young fellow?
I thought Darrin told me you had-- Gone to the great beyond?
Ah, that boy never gets anything right.
It was my wife.
Oh, I'm sorry.
You know what I'm thinking?
I hope so.
It was a real pleasure meeting you, sir.
Bye.
See you soon.
Bye.
What'd he mean by that?
"Bye" is short for "goodbye".
No, no, no.
What did she mean when she said, "You know what I'm thinking"?
And what did he mean when he said, "I hope so"?
Darrin, you're overwrought.
Here.
Eat your hot dog.
I have got bad vibrations about this.
Hello again.
And for a good reason.
Aunt Millicent, heh, I want you to meet, uh, Samantha and Grover Stephens, her husband's grandfather.
Hi, Grover.
Ma'am.
Ma'am.
You may call me Millicent.
Samantha, you can do us a big favor.
Um, Larry and I have seen this picture before and-- And he's getting this migraine headache-- Oh, well, then, I don't see why we just don't all go home.
Uh, because it's not necessary, Millicent.
I'm sure Sam and Grover won't mind if you join them for the movie.
Well, I wouldn't want to intrude.
It wouldn't be an intrusion.
Would it, Sam?
This is real sweet of you, Sam.
Well, thank you, Grover.
Grover.
You can drop Millicent off at our house on your way home.
You have fun now.
That's it.
Now, you behave yourself, you two.
Oh.
Bye.
Couldn't you persuade Grover to come in for just a minute?
We haven't had a chance to say two words to each other.
Hi, Sam.
Hi.
Where's Grover?
He's sitting in the car.
Well, have him come in.
Just for a cup of coffee.
Coffee keeps him awake.
Oh, well, then cocoa.
Cocoa puts him to sleep.
Then tea.
Yes, yes.
Come on in, Grover, just for a few minutes.
We'll have a cup of tea.
I won't take no for an answer.
How'd you like the movie, old-timer?
Passable, for a talkie.
I can't believe it.
What are you staring at, sonny?
The way you straightened that picture.
You know, your grandson, Darrin, does exactly the same thing every time he walks into this room.
Compulsive neatness runs in the family.
It's scary.
How do you like your tea?
Stop yelling at me.
Cream or lemon?
I'll have my tea with brandy.
With brandy?
Okay, forget the tea.
Just the brandy, and make it a double.
Make that two, Lawrence.
Sam?
I'm driving.
I like a boy who takes a nip now and then.
Aunt Millicent.
Well, I do.
A man who has a taste for brandy has a taste for life.
So you live in Montana, Grover.
What city?
Butte.
Butte?
Well, isn't that a mindblower?
One of my favorite spots used to be Matthew's.
On Front Street?
Yes, indeedy.
I stopped by there just last week.
Well, it was torn down last year.
Uh, uh-- Grandpa loves to look at excavations.
Samantha, I think we should make a break for it.
Okay, Grandpa.
Up we go.
Now, stop calling him "Grandpa".
You make him sound so old.
I'm aging fast.
Believe me.
That's downer talk, Grover.
You're still a groovy-looking boy.
Louise, I just had a great idea.
You know my meeting tomorrow night?
What meeting?
My meeting.
My meeting.
The meeting I can't miss.
Oh, that meeting.
Well, I can't miss the meeting.
No point in letting the tickets go to waste.
Why not give this groovy-looking boy and this far-out chick our theater tickets for tomorrow night?
Well, now, don't be pushy, Lawrence.
If Grover wants to ask me out, I guess he can speak for himself.
It's a great musical, Grover.
Uh, the truth is I've seen it.
What do you mean you've seen it?
I haven't even told you the name of it yet.
What-- What Grandpa means is-- Is that they-- They get all the road companies in Butte.
He's seen them all.
Well, he hasn't seen this one because tomorrow is opening night.
How did I let myself be talked into it?
Look at the bright side of things, sweetheart.
It's supposed to be a great musical.
Don't even joke about it, Sam.
I am not going out with that overaged hippie.
Mother, a-a joke is a joke.
Now, when I snap my fingers, I want you to appear front and center.
Is the novelty beginning to wear off, Samantha?
Mother, where are you?
Is the novelty beginning to wear off, Samantha?
Mother, you better materialize this instant.
This is a recording.
Funny.
Well Sam, I am coming very close to the end of my breakfast and the end of my rope.
Say something.
Something.
Sam.
Just as soon as I get in touch with Mother, you're going to hear plenty.
"Soon" in your crowd could mean a hundred years from now.
I need a face transplant by lunchtime.
Couldn't you postpone the lunch?
Impossible.
This is my first meeting with Booker.
He's on his way to Europe and will only be in town for a couple of hours.
So if I don't sell him at lunch, it's goodbye, account.
You are not going to let Mother get away with this.
You are going to that meeting.
How am I going to that meeting?
Just get in your car and go.
Well, you-- You said this is your first meeting with Booker, right?
Now, I mean, he's never met you, and you've never met him.
Right?
Right.
Then what's the problem?
If he doesn't know what you look like, what's the difference what you look like?
Um, a Mr. Jennings Booker here?
Ah, thank you.
Booker?
Yeah?
I'm Stephens.
Stephens?
W-Why do you say it that way?
It's a good old American name.
You were expecting me, weren't you?
Heh.
Well, not exactly.
I don't know where I got the impression that you'd be a younger man.
Yes, I do.
From Tate, who said he was assigning young Stephens to the account.
He always calls me "young Stephens".
Because I am young.
In here and in here, where it counts.
Now, let's see how the cookie crumbles.
Beau Geste is a line of toiletries that appeals to the 18- to 25-year age group.
Now, our motivational research-- Mr. Stephens?
Mm.
Yes?
There is a call for you, sir.
Oh, tha-- Thank you.
Uh, excuse me, Mr. Booker.
Uh, thank you, sonny.
Hello.
Oh, sweetheart.
I've been so worried.
How's it going?
As well as can be expected.
Has Endora shown up yet?
No, but-- But I'm tossing incantations all over the place.
Well, keep at it.
I'd better get back to the table.
My board meeting ended early, Mr. Booker.
and I thought I'd join you fellas and see if I could help out.
On second thought, I'd better not.
What is it?
Larry has just walked into the restaurant, and he's talking to Booker.
Sam, what am I gonna do?
You'll think of something.
I'm thinking of cutting my wrists.
Darrin, don't panic.
Sam, I've gotta make a move.
You have an idea?
Now, don't misunderstand me, Tate.
I admire you for keeping your employees on beyond the age of retirement.
I'm not sure I follow you.
Mm-hm.
I'll do it.
Now, hold on.
Are--?
Are we talking about the same Darrin Stephens?
Yes.
Age 70, bald head, mustache, slightly hunched over.
That is not, I repeat, not Darrin Stephens.
Then who is it?
I haven't the vaguest idea.
But I'm going to find out.
There he is.
That's him.
Hi, kids.
That's him?
That's Grover Stephens, Darrin's grandfather.
That's me.
Now, look, old-timer, I've been brought up to respect old age, and it isn't really very nice of you to pass yourself off as Darrin.
Now, what's everybody getting so het up about?
Darrin got up this morning with an infected throat that-- That could destroy the city.
What could the kid do?
He could've called the office.
Whatever for when I'm available?
Mr. Booker, I must apologize-- We forgive you, Lawrence, so just hush up.
Let's get cracking.
The kid filled me in as much as he could.
Now, let's put this in the gas tank and see how far it takes us.
What I had in mind was a saturation campaign for television.
Uh, fade in.
Interior, bathroom.
A nice-looking boy with glasses, the shy type, uh, has just finished shaving.
For the first time in his life, he-- He picks up a bottle of Beau Geste and dabs a little on his face.
And boom!
The bathroom becomes the Sahara.
The boy turns into a member of the French Foreign Legion.
He's right in the middle of a battle.
But here's the switch: He's fighting off girls.
Not bad for an old geezer, huh?
You son of a gun.
And when I finished my presentation, Beau Geste was in my back pocket.
That's my old man.
I bet Larry was thrilled.
He offered to make me Darrin's supervisor.
You hear that, Mother?
No matter what you do, things seem to work out.
So why don't you undo your thing?
That stubborn old witch will never-- Uh, Da-- Darrin, name-calling is not going to help.
Now, I know that Mother can behave badly at times, but deep down, she's-- She's-- Rotten.
If you don't mind, call Larry and tell him the date with Millicent is off.
Grandpa has been called home on an emergency.
Oh, sweetheart, that would break Millicent's heart.
She'll get over me.
Hi, Sam.
Well, what a surprise.
Thought we'd save Grover a trip and bring Millicent over here.
We came early so I'd have a chance to tell Darrin what a great job his grandfather did this afternoon.
Well, you c-- You can't.
He's sound asleep.
Oh, how's he feeling?
Well, he's feeling better, but he doesn't look so good.
Oh, well, he'll be all right.
Grover, you were great this afternoon.
Absolutely brilliant.
Darrin briefed me.
Oh, I'm so proud of you, Grover.
Ah, you may be proud, Millicent, but I'm bushed.
I'm afraid I just can't make our date tonight.
Oh, Grover.
Oh.
Oh-- Oh, well, I-I'm sure you understand.
It's-- It's all that business activity.
Uh-- Uh, Grandpa just wants to relax in front of the television set.
Oh, well, I'm sure Aunt Millicent doesn't care one way or the other, as long as they're together.
I guess you'd like a drink.
I'll go get some more ice.
Excuse me.
Will someone answer the door, please?
I'll get it.
Yes?
Is that the way you folks out here say hello?
Hi there.
Hello.
Hi.
What's the matter, Grover?
Cat got your tongue?
Uh, h-hello there.
Forgot my name so soon?
Well, you can't really blame him, dearie.
We've only been married Married?
Married?
Married?
You can't say it too often.
He needs reminding.
Married?
Okay, hot lips, I'm giving you one more chance.
And if I catch you messing around again, I'm going home to Mother.
All I was gonna do was watch wrestling with her.
You poor kid.
He was pulling the old wrestling bit on you, hm?
And what is that supposed to mean?
First, you watch wrestling and then he challenges you to a little match on the sofa.
Why-- Louise, take me home.
Oh!
You degenerate.
A man your age, carrying on like that.
And congratulations.
Sam, i-is that really you in there?
You bet your old-age pension it is.
Sam.
Okay, hot lips.
But I'm giving you one more chance.
And if I catch you messing around again, I'm going home to Mother.
Sweetheart, no matter how atrocious and abominable my mother might behave, she always comes to her senses.
Eventually.
Usually.
That's not what I'm worried about.
It isn't?
No.
Being turned into Rip Van Wrinkle for a couple of days to satisfy your mother's warped sense of humor isn't half as bad as wondering what's gonna happen when I really do grow old.
I mean, well, what's it gonna look like?
This old goat with that young chick.
Simple.
We'll grow old together.
But witches don't grow old at the same pace as-- Witches can do anything they want to do.
And I love you.
So this young chick and that old goat will look like a matched set.
How about a little preview?
How's that?
I can't tell.
Pucker up.
You're an oldie but a goody.
And as far as I'm concerned, you're still the sexiest thing that ever lived.
I can't stand it!
Mother.
Oh, it's ridiculous having a daughter who looks twice my age.
Now, you change yourself at once.
No.
I am gonna stay this way as long as Darrin stays that way.
Stubborn.
Okay, Mother?
Okay.
One, two-- Witch's honor?
Witch's honor.
One, two, three.
Thank you, Mother, dear.
Now, as for you, Endora-- Please, Darwood.
Excessive gratitude always embarrasses me.
Now, uh, where were we?
adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Sam?
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi.
How'd it go?
Like silk.
Larry and I played just a little under our usual game, and, fortunately, Mr. Langley beat us.
What'd he shoot?
A 68.
Oh, my.
It was certainly decent of you to let him win.
He made us look like hackers.
But considering he's the president of Bigelow Industries, it was the least we could do.
And you got the account?
Right.
Darrin?
Hm?
There's something I've been meaning to ask.
How come Mr. Langley is president of Bigelow Industries?
Well, the rumor is that Mr. Langley quietly garnered the majority of the stock.
And the next thing Bigelow knew, he was out.
Oh.
Now, for, uh, some more good news.
Yes?
Mr. Langley has invited us to join his country club.
I like the other good news better.
Well, naturally, I made it clear that I wanted to discuss it with you first.
Darrin, we don't need to join some dumb country club.
I couldn't agree more.
But this situation's a little bit delicate.
See, J.J. Langley is not only the president of Bigelow Industries, he is the president and founder of the club.
And it wouldn't be good business to turn him down.
Okay.
We'll join.
Good.
I filled out the application this morning.
I thought you said you wanted to discuss it with me first.
We just discussed it, didn't we?
Anyway, uh, here's the procedure.
Sometime next week, I have to play golf with two of the men on the admissions committee, Heh.
How does that thrill you?
I have a better idea.
Hm?
Why don't I play golf and you entertain the ladies?
Ah!
My dear child.
How are you?
Mother, it's not that I'm not glad to see you, but don't you think that Darrin and I deserve a certain amount of privacy?
Who?
Oh, him.
Sam, don't expect your mother to be gracious.
She doesn't do imitations.
And if you'll excuse me, I'll go upstairs and change.
Oh, please don't change, Durwood.
I want to forget you exactly as you are.
Mother-- Hm?
--if you are going to insist upon popping in like this, uh, couldn't you be a bit more pleasant?
Well, it isn't easy.
But I'll try.
Can't you see what that feeble excuse for a husband is doing to you?
He's turning you into a live-in maid, an unpaid cook and a babysitter.
And now he's forcing you to submit to the environment of a country club, which is just a meeting place for organized mortal snobs.
I would love to sit here and bicker, but I have to get lunch.
So if you'll excuse me Now, wait.
Wait.
Why can't you take an example from your cousin Serena?
Oh.
Well, she doesn't worry about diapers or dinners or country clubs.
She's footloose and fancy-free.
She's quicksilver.
She lives in the sparkle of a star, in a flash of color.
See all the fun you're missing?
How about those handsome devils?
I wouldn't trade Darrin for a hundred of them.
And he's every bit as attractive.
Mortal life has not only thrown sand in your mental gears, it has also affected your eyesight.
If you'd like some lunch, stick around.
Hmph!
Tsk.
There must be some way to make her see the light, some way to remind her of what she's given up.
Of course.
I wonder why it didn't dawn on me before.
The Corsican brothers Were hexed by a spell Which will work on cousins Just as well From this point on Without further ado What Serena feels Samantha will too Well!
Oh!
Okay, who's the wise guy?
Sweetheart, you'll be ready for lunch soon?
Well, that depends.
Is Ma Barker still here?
Darrin, that is no way to talk about my mother.
And she's gone.
You're pretty gone yourself, you know that?
Well, thank you, sir.
No, I mean it.
About the country club, I know we don't dig that stuff.
It was really great of you to go along with it.
Hm.
You're the best little witch a man ever had.
Oh, be careful, my sweet.
Those are very hot.
Mm!
Ooh!
Ooh!
Oh.
Ooh.
What--?
What was that?
Heh.
It's called a kiss.
Uh, n-no.
I-I felt a burning sensation.
They don't call me "Hot Lips" Stephens for nothing.
I-I guess there must be a lot of static electricity in the air.
Oh, h-hi, Larry.
Hi, Sam, Darrin.
Hi, Larry.
Louise was still asleep when I got back from golf, so I thought I'd just drop over.
Mm.
Darrin tell you the good news about our getting the Langley account?
Oh, uh, y-yes.
That's wonderful.
And how about Langley inviting you to join his club?
I just can't tell you how I feel about that.
I knew you'd be delighted.
And I've got more good news.
We were blackballed?
What?
You know Sam and her sense of humor.
You may not realize it, but it's a great honor to be invited to join that club.
Yes.
I-I'm sure it is.
Stop that.
It's certainly nothing to laugh about.
I didn't know you were ticklish.
Well, I am.
I'm sorry.
Well, I'm not that ticklish.
Uh-- Uh, Larry, y-you said you had more good news?
Oh-- Oh-- Oh, yes.
Langley just called.
Boy, you really made an impression on him.
And his wife.
She heads up the women's admissions committee.
Oh.
She wants-- She and her co-chairman wanna drop in and meet Sam right away.
Right aw--?
Right away, when?
This afternoon.
This afternoon?
I knew you'd be tickled.
Mrs. Langley suggested 3:00, if that's okay with you.
Oh.
Ha-ha-ha!
I never knew 3:00 was such a funny hour.
Why am I laughing?
I have to go home and wake up Louise.
Well, bye, you two.
Good luck.
Honey.
Hm?
What's the matter with you?
Well, I-I don't-- I don't know.
I-I've just got the giggles, I guess.
Well, you laughed in some pretty unfunny places.
Well-- Well, I couldn't help it.
It-- It was involuntary.
Like-- Like the hiccups.
Sam, is there something wrong with you?
Uh, something witchy?
Oh-- Oh, please.
Please.
Uh, ju-- Just don't mention it.
Oh, now, Clark, behave yourself.
Ha-ha.
Let's order some lunch.
I'm starved.
Maybe we ought to have lunch.
I'm starved.
Wait until you taste this lobster salad.
It's delicious.
I think I'll have the ring-tailed pheasant.
It sounds out of sight.
Uh, why do I have this sudden craving for ring-tailed pheasant?
The last time you wanted ring-tailed pheasant, we found out Adam was on his way.
No, I can assure you this is not the same ring-tailed pheasant.
Well, excuse me.
I have to go to the market.
Uh, in the middle of lunch?
Would you care to explain that?
Not now.
I have to have some ring-tailed pheasant.
Uh, besides, I, uh-- I-I wanna pick up something to serve Mrs. Langley and her friend when they arrive.
I think I'd better do something to make sure they don't arrive.
Darrin, don't just stand there.
I have got to have some ring-tailed pheasant.
Here's some chicken Kiev.
Won't that do?
No.
No, it has to be ring-tailed pheasant.
Care for some more?
Oh, no.
I couldn't eat another bite.
Here it is.
Springer's ring-tailed pheasant.
Too late.
My craving just vanished.
Well, uh, come on.
There's some things I wanna get for the ladies of the Inquisition.
Uh, Sam, will you forget about them?
I'm gonna call Larry right now and tell him to cancel.
Oh, Darrin, don't worry.
As soon as we get home, I'll get in touch with Dr. Bombay, and he'll fix whatever's wrong with me.
Yeah.
I'm gonna call Larry right now and tell him to cancel.
Come on.
Let's groove.
There's no music.
There is now.
I tried to get Larry, but his line is busy.
What are you doing?
I think I'm dancing.
You can dance your way out of here and into the parking lot, and I'll call Larry as soon as we get home.
That's it.
Let's take five, or maybe 10.
It stopped.
Just as suddenly as it started.
I don't understand it.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
I'll call Larry and get rid of Mrs. Langley and her friend while you get in touch with Dr. Bombay, and I'm sure-- Heh.
Uh, Mrs. Langley, right?
When you're right, you're right.
Why are they here an hour early?
To take me by surprise.
It's an old female trick used by old females.
Well, they're here, so let's just make the best of it.
Oh, Mrs. Langley.
How nice to see you.
I'd like you to meet my wife, Samantha.
Oh, how do you do?
How do you do?
And may I introduce my co-chairman, Mrs. Hunter.
Mrs. Hunter.
Nice to meet you.
So nice to know you.
I know we're a little bit early, but I thought you wouldn't mind.
Oh, no.
No, of course not.
Please, come right in.
Please, ladies, uh, do go in and make yourselves comfortable.
Uh, could I fix you ladies a cocktail?
A cocktail?
Well, hardly in the middle of the day.
Thank you.
Sweetheart, it's earlier than you think.
I think it's later than I think.
Please, please.
Won't you go in and make yourselves comfortable?
And, um, I'll start the refreshments.
I'll help you, honey.
Uh-oh.
It's Hermione.
Who's Hermione?
My wife.
You are a rat.
And that is an insult to rats.
Serena, my dear, you seem to be upset.
I am.
The beast didn't tell me he was married.
I hate men, all men.
Sam, why are you being so obstinate?
Don't you know that there's something radically wrong with you?
Yes.
And I know what it is.
You.
What?
Oh, I-I'm sorry, sweetheart.
I-I guess I'm upset.
Being a man, you wouldn't understand.
You're beginning to bug me.
And I don't know why.
Well-- Well, I do.
Whatever is wrong with you is probably a spell of your mother's.
Spell or no spell, you're bugging me.
I'm sorry it took so long.
But that's what happens when men decide to help out in the kitchen.
Well, answer the door, will you?
At least they're good for something.
Hi, Darrin.
Oh, Larry, what are you--?
I just came by to keep you company when the ladies get-- Oh, they're here already.
Yes.
They sort of caught us by surprise.
How are you, Mrs. Langley?
Mrs. Hunter, nice to see you.
Mr. Tate.
Hello.
Oh, don't pay any attention to me, ladies.
I just came by to keep Darrin company.
How are things going?
We haven't started yet, and you're not helping.
I beg your pardon?
Tsk.
Men are such a drag, aren't they?
They can be.
Mrs. Stephens has a very special sense of humor.
It takes a little getting used to, but it's worth it.
I'm sure.
Mr. Stephens, the purpose of our visit was to get to know Mrs. Stephens.
So In other words, get lost.
Sure.
Sure.
Now, where were we?
What's she mad about?
Oh, yeah, she's not mad.
Uh, when she gets nervous, she just sounds mad.
Oh, boy, what have you got for a hangover?
How about a bicarb?
This is a hangover I'm trying to get.
Oh, my goodness.
Oh, excuse me, ladies.
Uh, my canapés are burning.
Oh.
You really surprise me, Serena.
Crying because a silly warlock ran out on you?
I'm not crying because he ran out on me.
Then why are you?
Because now I don't have anything to do this afternoon.
Oh, thank you.
I-I'm-- I'm afraid they're a little scorched.
It's the first time it's happened.
Uh It makes me so angry I could cry.
Oh, but, my dear, they're not that scorched.
Oh, why, you can barely tell that they're burnt.
Now what's the matter with her?
Well, she, uh-- It must be her hay fever.
I never knew Sam had hay fever.
Well, you know Sam.
She hates to brag.
Heh.
I think I'd better have another one of these.
Oh, stop sniveling this instant.
You're spoiling everything.
What am I spoiling?
None of your business.
But you need something to cheer you up.
Ah.
Drink this, and it will change your whole outlook.
It will?
Mm-hm.
One drink, and look out.
Sounds groovy.
Mm!
It's not bad.
What is it?
Witches' Joy Juice.
I never heard of it.
Well, that's because I just made it up.
You know, you've been very good to me, and I'd like to thank you both.
Tabitha.
What an odd name.
Is that Scandinavian?
No.
It's international.
Oh, were you born abroad by any chance?
Huh?
Oh.
Heh-heh.
No.
A-Actually, I-- Why do you wanna know where I was born?
That's no way to judge a person.
Oh, well, of course not.
We only asked because-- Because you don't accept foreign-born members, right?
That is not true.
We have one member from Brooklyn.
Oh, is that a fact?
Whoopee!
I beg your pardon?
Well, if a member from Brooklyn doesn't deserve a "whoopee," who does?
Hi.
Now what's the matter with her?
Well, uh, w-when Sam gets nervous and then starts sounding mad, she usually takes a little nip or two to give her confidence.
This stuff sure does cheer you up.
I think you're happy enough.
Oh, auntie.
Have another burnt offering.
Ooh!
Ha-ha!
Whoopsie-daisy.
No, no, no, no.
Leave them for the mice.
Ha-ha.
Just a little whimsy to liven up the party.
Darrin, do something, quick.
Or we'll lose the Langley account.
And we don't even have it yet.
What can I do?
I don't know.
Yell "fire".
Anything.
Perhaps we should have given Mrs. Stephens a little more notice.
Uh, we seem to have caught her at a bad time.
Oh, no.
Not at all.
Anytime would have been a bad time.
Say, where did you get that hat?
Oh, uh, do you like it?
Nope.
I just wanna make sure I stay out of that store.
I think we should be leaving.
Oh, there's an idea.
Whoop.
Hee-hee.
You're not leaving already?
We really must go.
Oh, no.
Please stay.
You're entitled to an explanation, and I'm going to give it to you, just as soon as I find out what it is.
Excuse us just a minute.
Uh, Mrs. Langley, Mrs. Hunter, please come back and sit down.
You-- Samantha's not really herself today.
But I-I-I'm sure in no time, we'll find out-- Uh, s-sit down.
Samantha, what the devil is going on?
Don't ask me.
Ask the devil.
Or his closest relative, who happens to be your mother.
Ooh.
I think there's no reason to wait longer.
I'm afraid I found out more than I want to.
Uh, Mrs. Langley, please.
Uh, l-ladies, I-I'm sure if you-- If you'll just wait for just a second-- Mrs. Langley.
Mrs. Langley, I promised you an explanation, and I think I-I finally have it.
Yes?
The only problem is how to explain it.
Oh, please don't bother.
Mr. Langley is going to be very disappointed.
Tsk.
That's too bad.
But I bet he won't be half as disappointed as Mr. Bigelow was when Mr. Langley got rid of him.
When I tell Mr. Langley about this outrageous interview-- That's what you get for dropping in early and snooping on people.
Outrageous interviews.
Ha-ha.
I suppose you know what this means.
I suppose you know what this means.
Uh, Mrs. Langley, Darrin's just an employee.
I'm the president of McMann & Tate.
Peekaboo.
I suppose you know what this means.
I sure do.
Whoopee!
Ooh, my.
Ha-ha.
Ooh, the Kickapoo Joy Juice.
I have a wonderful idea for your mother.
What's that?
She should be sent to a psychiatrist, if witches have such a thing.
They don't.
Then they should invent one just for her.
Oh, will you calm down?
She came back and took the spell off me, didn't she?
Hm.
That was swell of her.
After I lost the Langley account.
You do realize you're talking to a man who's going to have to find a new job?
Well, maybe it's time for a change.
Yeah, of wives.
Darrin.
Hi, Darrin.
I thought you and I weren't speaking.
Where's your sense of humor?
When I said you were fired, you didn't think I meant you were fired?
What did you mean?
Hi, Sam.
Wait till you hear.
Hear what?
I just heard it on the radio.
The swindle that Langley pulled to get Bigelow out of the company will be front-page stuff.
And our being involved with him at a time like this could-- Could have ruined us.
That's what I call luck.
What makes you think it was luck?
Hm?
I told you we should have told him.
Told him what?
Why I put on that little performance for the ladies.
You mean you knew about Langley?
But how?
Well, uh, Sam didn't, uh, really know.
She just had a, uh, premonition.
A premonition?
Come on, Sam, tell me the truth.
How did you find out about it?
Larry, uh, don't tell anybody, but I'm married to a witch.
A premonition, huh?
Now, let's have a drink on it.
adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Morning, sweetheart.
Morning.
How do you feel?
I feel fine.
Have you got a headache or something?
What makes you think I have a headache?
Your head looks like it's aching.
Cute.
But I feel fine.
Well, I, uh, only asked because it was after 4 when you got to bed last night.
I stayed up to work out a new approach to the campaign for Harmon Savings and Loan.
And you found it?
I hope so.
I've struck out three times in a row, and I don't want to be a four-time loser.
Well, you're just in a little slump.
Sam, are you sure your mother hasn't been fooling around?
Sweetheart, when Mother fools around, there is no question about it.
Now, you're just a little tired and upset.
I'll fix breakfast.
You'll feel better.
I'm not upset and I'm not tired and I feel fine.
If he's like this when he's fine, however do you endure him when he's miserable?
Good morning, sweetheart.
Mother.
Good morning, Durwood.
Don't you ever knock?
Oh, sorry.
Never mind breakfast, Sam.
I just lost my appetite.
My, aren't we touchy this morning?
Mother, may I ask a simple question and get an honest answer?
"Yes" to the first and "maybe" to the second.
Please, make an all-out effort.
Endora, you have all the charm of a hooded cobra.
Well, never mind that, Mother.
Just answer the question.
All right.
I have not been meddling in what's-his-name's work.
Witch's honor.
Thank you, Mother.
There, your worries are over.
That doesn't mean I won't start.
If my worries are over, how come my headache just got worse?
Good morning, Darrin.
I hope you feel lucky this morning.
Larry, I have a feeling, uh, we shouldn't trust my luck.
It hasn't been too good lately.
Now, there's no reason for that attitude, Darrin.
I mean, just because you've been consistently bombing out lately doesn't mean it's going to continue.
Why not?
Because if it continues, you won't.
Mind if I take a look?
Be my guest.
Hm.
Hm.
Mm-hm.
Mm-hm.
I like it.
It's cute, but not too cute.
Original, but not too far-out.
And it gets the message across without being obvious.
You really like it?
I'm sure I'll think it's terrific.
When?
When the client loves it.
Yes?
Oh, send him in.
Send him in.
It's Harmon.
Now, pull yourself together.
Let's have some positive thinking.
Oh-ho, good to see you, Mr. Harmon.
Come in.
Come in.
You remember Darrin Stephens?
Of course I remember Stephens.
How are you, Mr. Harmon?
It's his last three ideas I'm trying to forget.
Well, you know how unpredictable creative people are.
And Stephens is one of the most creative men we have.
Okay, okay.
Let's see what he's created this time and let's be quick.
My time is money, you know.
Oh, we know.
We know.
Show him what you have, Darrin.
He's got a great idea.
Let me be the judge of that.
Yes, of course.
Now, as you will see, uh, this idea is adaptable to all advertising media and it is aimed at the smaller investor.
What's that?
I-It's a grasshopper.
You see-- Grasshopper?
I have the largest investment firm in the country and you give me a grasshopper?
Well, this idea i-i-is in four parts, each one dependent on the other.
Now, here you see a, uh, grasshopper in a business suit followed by a hippie caterpillar.
Grasshopper?
Caterpillar?
What do you think I'm advertising, a pest-control service?
Do you have reservations about this idea, Mr. Harmon?
Uh, Mr. Harmon hasn't seen it yet.
What else have you got?
A cockroach, maybe?
No.
A ladybug, carrying her purse and also about-- Darrin, I don't think we're reaching Mr. Harmon.
Mr. Harmon, if you'll just hear me out.
I've heard and seen enough.
It's got the cutes and it's too far-out.
Interesting.
I was making a similar comment earlier.
If you have nothing better to offer, I have other business.
Uh, Mr. Harmon, if you'll just give us a little more time on this, I'm sure we can get the bugs out.
Uh, Mr. Harmon, I'll call you at your hotel later.
Wait-- You and your lousy ideas.
But you said you liked it.
I do.
I do, but the client doesn't.
Which brings me to an interesting hypothesis.
What's that?
The problem is you.
Admittedly, it's a good idea but you're projecting such a lack of confidence that the client would hate it even if he loved it.
Larry, believe me, Mr. Harmon's reaction has nothing to do with my lack of confidence.
No?
What do you think it is?
Black magic, maybe?
Would you believe me if I said yes?
Darrin, you're tired.
Why don't you take a few days off and we'll discuss it then?
Okay?
Sam?
Sam?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
What are you doing home so early?
Ask your mother.
Uh-oh.
That's right.
Your mother's struck again.
I had a perfectly good idea.
Larry loved it.
And then I barely got started when, zap, for no reason, the client hated it.
Your mother is worse than Typhoid Mary.
Okay, careful, sweetheart.
Careful, my foot.
Did you hear that, Mary?
I did.
And I'm sure they also heard it six blocks away.
Good.
Endora, I'm telling you for the last time, keep your hocus-pocus out of my life.
Typical mortal behavior, looking for a scapegoat to blame for their own failures.
Uh, Mother, did you put a spell on Darrin?
There's nothing I could do to Durwood that wouldn't be an improvement.
So it's perfectly obvious I didn't do anything.
But you're tempting me.
Well, n-never mind.
But-- But I-- I would appreciate it if you'd leave us alone for a while.
Like forever.
Darrin.
So long, Mary.
I've not only lost a daughter, I've gained a bullhorn.
You-- Oh-- Uh-- Now-- Now, sweetheart, uh, relax.
It-- It really isn't fair to blame Mother.
Uh, somebody has been horsing around.
But it could be Serena or Uncle Arthur or Daddy-- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know.
Any one of a cast of thousands.
Okay.
So the only way to solve this is to find out what the spell is, where it came from and then deal with it.
Well, how do we do that?
I'll get Dr. Bombay and he can give you a test to find out what kind of a spell you're under.
That's a big help.
Calling in one fraud to substantiate another.
Darrin, look at it this way: It's the only game in town.
Okay.
Okay.
Calling all stations From Hong Kong to Pompeii.
Come in if you read me Dr. Bombay.
Dr. Bombay, here.
Never mind your pills Forget your thermometer Come on the run With your trusty hexometer His trusty what?
His hexom-- Hexometer.
I invented this remarkable machine to detect the presence of witchcraft on or about a person.
No home should be without it.
Nothing.
And I don't appreciate this emergency call.
I was about to tackle my nurse.
Tackle your nurse?
Naturally.
You don't think we'd play touch, do you?
That would be indecent.
Dr. Bombay, uh, could you just tell us about the witchcraft?
Very well.
First of all, I must hook him up to the machine.
Sam, this isn't going to prove anything except what an idiot I am for submitting to it.
Not your arm, my boy, your head.
Now, stand still, sweetheart.
It won't hurt.
What's happening?
All your hot air is rising to the surface.
Mm-hm.
It's clean.
Absolutely no exhaust emission, as you can see.
My boy, you're loaded with witchcraft.
But you said it was clean.
Perfectly.
Witchcraft exhaust is clean.
Mortal exhaust is dirty.
Terrific.
Dr. Bombay, uh, could you tell us who put the spell on Darrin?
Of course, my dear.
In a few moments, the perpetrator of this ghastly crime will appear on my oscillator.
That's peculiar.
The metaphysical atmospheric continuum is strangely scrambled.
So I'm afraid I can't tell you who, uh-- Who cast this spell.
B-But, doctor-- Precisely, "doctor".
I am not a mystic.
Call me if he gets violent.
And now I have to get back to my nurse.
I think the next play called for a pass.
Get it?
"Nurse"?
"Pass"?
Nothing.
He's gone, sweetheart.
That's the problem.
How can I be sure?
Now, don't you worry.
I'll get to the bottom of this.
In the meantime, I think you ought to have a little drink and relax.
I think I'll have a lot of big drinks and collapse.
Darrin, you'll be late for the office.
I'm not going to the office today, Sam.
You better call Larry.
What will I tell him?
Tell him I've retired.
If that's a joke, I don't get it.
Sam I have an announcement to make: I give up.
I am tired of bucking all this witchcraft.
No matter how hard I try, someone in your family fouls things up.
Darrin, what would you say if I told you that I contacted all my relatives and they're innocent?
I got a witch's honor from all of them.
And Dr. Bombay confessed that his hexometer is out of whack.
I would say that we already know Bombay is a quack and the credibility gap between honor and your relatives could be measured in light-years.
Darrin, you're overreacting.
What's wrong with retiring?
You can zap us up a-- A castle in Spain, a-- A villa in Rome, a chateau in the south of France.
Uh-- Oh, we'll need a yacht.
Uh, nothing flashy, not too big.
Uh, somewhere between the, uh, Queen Mary and the Enterprise.
This is crazy.
You can't give up your career.
We are my career from now on, you and me.
We'll spend all our time doing the things we wouldn't normally be able to do for 20 years, if ever.
Well, sweetheart, I-- I don't blame you for being upset.
After what you've been through, you had a perfect right to-- Don't try to spare my feelings.
If there's one thing I can't stand, it's someone feeling sorry for me.
Especially when you're doing such a good job of it yourself.
You'll get used to it.
And zap up some breakfast.
I'm starving.
Sweetheart?
Where's my breakfast?
Well, your breakfast can wait a minute.
What I have to say is more important.
Sam, I don't care to hear any more arguments.
I give in.
From now on, I'm retired.
We live by witchcraft.
No arguments.
I agree with you completely.
Almost.
Almost?
Except for one thing.
Except for the witchcraft.
Mm-mm.
Except for the retirement.
Now, come on, Sam.
I-- I said no more arguments.
Who's arguing?
I'm agreeing with you, but I think you should continue working.
With your know-how and my witchcraft there is no end to the heights you could reach.
Before you know it, Stephens & Tate will be the largest advertising agency in the world.
Maybe the only one.
Why go to all that trouble?
Oh, come on.
Try it just for today.
See what fun it is.
Uh, l-like, I could whip up a little witchcraft and you could take that same concept back to Harmon and he'd buy it just like that.
Yeah?
Yeah, it would be fun to see the look on Larry's face.
You do have a lot of faith in that savings-and-loan concept, don't you?
Absolutely.
Okay.
Now, all you have to do is drink this.
Then you-- You say the following: Pinchly, finchly Potsy, rex Quiddily quaddily Beware this hex And then?
There's a moment of discomfort.
What's that?
You turn purple.
Oh, well, it only lasts a second.
And then?
You become master of any situation.
Well, okay.
Chow.
Tastes like orange juice.
Comes in all flavors.
Yeah?
And now what do I say?
Oh, um, Pinchly, finchly Potsy, rex Quiddily quaddily Beware this hex Pinchly, finchly Potsy Potsy, rex Quiddily quaddily Beware this hex Oh, I-- I forgot.
You have to turn around three times.
Oh.
One.
Two.
Three.
It's working.
Well, what'd you expect?
I'm a witch.
There.
You're all set.
I don't know what's the matter with me.
I should have swung with this a long time ago.
Well, I'm on my way.
Wish me luck, Sam.
Luck has nothing to do with it anymore.
It's a sure thing.
You're right.
This is going to be fun.
Mwah.
Ooh.
Come in.
Darrin, what are you doing here?
I thought I told you to rest up for a few days.
I'm all rested and ready to tackle Harmon again.
I am sure I can sell him this presentation now.
The same presentation?
That's right.
Go home.
You need more rest.
Larry, in your mind the Harmon account is down the drain, right?
Right.
Then what have we got to lose?
But the same presentation?
Harmon hated it.
Harmon didn't even hear it.
But today he'll listen.
What makes you think so?
Well, I-- I wasn't myself yesterday.
But things are different now.
Things are different?
Well, just take my word for it.
Make another date with Harmon and he's in the bag.
I'll be waiting in my office.
Bugs?
Again?
What's he got, a fetish?
Mr. Harmon, you're considering hiring this agency to handle your advertising because we're specialists in the field.
So just sit there and listen to what this specialist has to say.
I think I'm listening to a first-class fruitcake.
Darrin, I don't think we should waste any more of Mr. Harmon's valuable time.
Larry, you may stay and listen only if you promise not to interrupt again.
Now just a mo-- Ah Please, sit down.
I'm warning both of you that these interruptions are beginning to make me very impatient.
Stephens has been sick.
Very unusual virus.
Oh, really?
Must have picked up some kind of bug.
Virus.
Now, the, uh, grasshopper, the caterpillar and the ladybug represent the smaller investors marching into Harmon Savings and Loan.
Please, Stephens, I don't think of my investors as bugs.
Darrin, I don't think that-- Mr. Tate, will you please be quiet?
Now, these small investors-- Please, Stephens, they're bugs.
Bugs are bugs.
That is the last interruption I will tolerate.
Now, just sit there and listen and in a moment, something will hit you and you'll love it.
To repeat they represent the smaller investors marching into Harmon Savings and Loan.
And the slogan for this campaign will be: "At Harmon Savings and Loan, "there are no small investors.
They're as big as you are, whoever you are".
Are you finished?
Yes.
All right, then.
Let's break up this meeting, Darrin, so you can get home and start a year's sick leave.
Please, Mr. Stephens, may I say something now?
Of course.
"At Harmon Savings and Loan, "there are no small investors.
They're as big as you are, whoever you are".
It rings a bell.
I like it.
Darrin, get the phone.
Phone?
It must have been.
I heard that bell ringing too.
It's an inspiration, my boy.
Stephens I've never seen an idea presented with more confidence.
I'm impressed.
It's your kind of enthusiasm that makes ours a great country.
Mr. Harmon, this is going to be great for you.
The grasshopper, the caterpillar and the ladybug represent the little people.
You see-- I get it, Tate.
You don't have to explain it to me.
Besides, at Harmon Savings and Loan, there are no little people.
They're as big as you are, whoever you are.
Right, Stephens?
Right, Harmon.
Let's see those little fellows again.
Yeah.
Ah!
Hi, sweetheart.
How'd it go?
Oh, it went great.
I mean, why shouldn't it?
It was a foregone conclusion.
Well, that calls for a celebration.
Why is it I don't feel like celebrating?
I don't know.
Why is it?
All the way home I was asking myself the same question.
I mean, I'm not sure I like not having to worry about anything.
It isn't much fun knowing how everything is going to turn out, is it?
Well, there is something to be said for worrying about where your next meal is coming from.
Gives you a chance to work up an appetite.
Sam, could you kind of back up time, like, to before we made this witchcraft deal today?
I'd like to reconsider.
I, um-- It isn't necessary.
Oh, yes, it is, because-- What do you mean, it isn't necessary?
Uh Well, the way you're feeling now, I guess you won't mind.
I hope you won't mind.
Are you gonna mind?
Come on.
Come on.
Out with it.
O-o-okay.
Witchcraft had nothing to do with what happened in your meeting this afternoon.
Are you trying to tell me that--?
That that purple routine was just--?
Was just a way of helping you regain your confidence.
You didn't believe me this morning when I told you there wasn't a spell on you, but it was true.
Wait a minute.
That means I was in an ordinary slump, and I did use witchcraft as an excuse.
It takes you a while, Dobbin, but you finally have the picture.
And I went to that meeting thinking-- Sam, that was a terrible chance to take.
I wasn't taking any chances.
You told me your idea was a good one.
Just because the client is difficult to convince doesn't mean the idea will fail.
You said that yourself.
Yeah.
I did say that, didn't I?
On the other hand, it probably will.
Stop paying attention to her and start paying attention to me.

{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hi.
This is Elizabeth Montgomery.
Welcome to Bewitched, next on ABC.
Tonight's show was created in the true spirit of Christmas.
The story was written by the 10th grade English class at Thomas Jefferson High School in Los Angeles.
My friends at Oscar Mayer and Company and I feel it is a very special Bewitched, conceived in the image of innocence, and filled with truth.
Mommy, look.
I wrapped Lisa's present.
Oh, sweetheart, that's terrific.
Now, uh, Tabitha, this is the first time that you ever have anyone spend the night, and I want to make sure that you remember everything I told you.
I'm supposed to share my toys and don't fly.
No flying and no witchcraft of any kind.
It'll be like having a temporary sister for a couple of days.
I wish I had a real sister, 'cause they don't break things all the time.
Oh.
Adam didn't mean to break your jack-in-the-box.
Did you, sweetheart?
Adam.
What's going on?
Oh, just a little sibling quibbling.
It'll pass.
That's them.
Have you had that talk with Tabitha?
Yeah, I did.
Everything's fine.
Hi there.
Come on in.
Hi, Darrin.
How are you, Dorothy?
Pete, good to see you.
Hi, Lar.
Hi, Sam.
Hi.
And you're Lisa.
Hello, Mr. Stephens.
It's nice meeting you.
Oh, it's nice meeting you too, Lisa.
We're very happy you're going to stay with us.
Especially me.
Uh, that's "temporary".
As in sisters.
Right.
Come on, Lisa, I'll show you the tree.
Uh, and don't forget to introduce Lisa to Adam.
Do I have to?
Yes.
Uh, come on in, everybody.
Oh, we haven't got time, Sam.
We gotta get to the airport.
I'll just say a last goodbye to Lisa.
You've been saying goodbye all the way over here.
Ha-ha.
Have fun, sweetheart.
We'll be back before Santa Claus comes.
Oh, Brockway called.
He wants to meet us at the office this afternoon to go over the layout revisions.
I'll be there.
Good.
Now, if you land Brockway, and Keith comes home with the Fenmore account, we'll really have a white Christmas.
Uh.
Watch that.
Come on.
Bye, Sam.
Bye-bye.
Have a good trip.
Have a good time.
Well, shall we finish trimming the tree?
Uh, I've got a little work to do.
And final touches on the, uh, Brockway layouts.
Oh, okay.
Then we'll go to the park.
How does that sound?
Goody.
I'll get my coat.
Hello?
Oh, Mr. Brockway.
How are you?
Fine, fine.
Good.
Yes, I have just put the final touches on the layouts, and, uh, forgive the immodesty, but, uh, they're great.
Mother always said: "Don't trust a man who is modest.
He knows something".
Uh, the reason I called you is I'd like to postpone our appointment from 2 until 4:00 this afternoon.
Is that okay?
Sure.
Four o'clock is fine.
Good.
See you at the office, Stephens.
Get his address.
We have the office address.
His home address.
Mother also said: "Never sign a contract "without checking a man's home life.
"Make sure there are no skeletons rattling around the family closet".
I'm ready for my warm milk and cookies now, Miss Hathaway.
Hey, you colored her arm green.
I can't stay inside the lines too good.
"Too well".
Too well.
You color your girl green too.
Then they can be sisters.
'Cause they can't be sisters if they're different colors.
Okay.
Where did you get that idea?
The girl in the park.
She said that Lisa and me weren't the same color, so we couldn't be sisters.
She's a big dope.
That's not nice, Tabitha.
She got me mad.
I almost did some magic to her.
Tabitha.
I wasn't going to tell, Mommy.
Tell what?
Oh, uh, I-I think Adam is up from his nap.
Uh, why don't you come upstairs for a minute and help me?
Now?
Now.
Anyway, don't forget we're sisters, no matter what anybody says.
Okay.
Hello.
Well, hello there.
Oh, my.
Aren't you a fine, great big girl?
I'll bet your mommy's the housekeeper, right?
What housekeeper?
Uh, your mommy works here.
Or is it your papa?
My daddy works for McMann & Tate, a big advertising company.
Oh, he does?
Mm-hm.
And Tabitha's my sister.
We're not the same color, but we're sisters just the same.
Oh.
Uh, well, then you must look like your mommy.
Uh, right?
"Splitting image," Daddy says.
You wanna see somebody?
Uhno.
I think I've seen enough.
Heh.
Bye.
Goodbye.
Oh, no.
Now look what I did.
If you close your eyes, I'll clean you up.
Why do I have to close my eyes?
It's a family secret.
Okay.
Oh, boy.
I didn't mean to do it, but it's great.
Didn't mean to do what?
How'd you do that?
Well, now that we're the same color, we're really sisters.
So I guess I can tell you, 'cause it's a family secret.
I'm a witch.
But witches are only in stories.
You can't be a witch.
Okay, then.
Explain how you changed color.
You're a witch.
Do you ride a broom?
Witches don't ride brooms, and they don't wear pointy hats and have warts on their nose.
What do you do?
I do this.
Wow.
You really are a witch.
What else could you do?
Can you change you like me?
Hey, now we're sisters the other way.
Wow.
Even your own mother wouldn't recognize you.
I didn't think of that.
Gee.
Now we're not the same anymore.
Yeah, I wish we were.
Me too.
But if I turned you white, your mother wouldn't recognize you.
Yeah.
I wish there was some way.
I know a way.
Apparently, Mr. Brockway stopped by here earlier, and someone from your illustrious family made such an impression on him that he's decided he wants someone else on the account.
He thinks I'm not stable.
Darrin, Mr. Brockway did not come by here today.
Besides, all my relatives are out of town for the holidays.
Where out of town?
The 14th century.
Far enough?
He's right.
I'm not stable.
Darrin, everything around here today has been as mortal as blueberry pie.
Mommy?
Yes, sweetheart?
Mommy, don't be mad.
I was just wishing and wishing that Lisa and me could be really, really sisters, and look what happened.
Relax, sweetheart.
It isn't witchcraft.
Then what is it?
"Wishcraft".
And when I tried to change us back, I couldn't.
Sam.
Hi.
Is everything all right with Tabitha and Lisa this morning?
Everything's fine.
They slept well and ate all their breakfast.
Now, come on, Sam.
Uh, you know what I mean.
Come on, Lisa.
D-Darrin, don't panic.
Good morning, Daddy.
Good morning, dear.
Good morning, Mr. Stephens.
Good morning, Lisa.
Can we go upstairs and play now?
Sure.
Come on, Lisa.
Uh, you said the polka dots would disappear by this morning.
Well, I-I have a call in to Dr. Bombay.
I told him what the problem is.
And the problem is?
Tabitha doesn't want to change back.
Well, you're a bigger witch than she is.
Do something.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
Her conscious mind wants to obey me, but Tabitha and Lisa want to be sisters so badly that her subconscious mind won't cooperate.
How about getting through to her little-old subconscious with a little, old-fashioned mortal spanking?
Darrin.
I'll get it.
Merry Christmas.
I guess you're still a little angry about yesterday.
You're not gonna believe this, but I'd forgotten about it.
Oh.
Larry.
Oh, hi, Sam.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, thank you.
Put it under the tree.
Good.
I decided not to let Brockway get away with this.
I want my number one man on that account.
Since when am I back to number one?
Ever since Ferguson bombed out.
Darrin, we can't let the Brockway account out of our office.
And you're the only man who can follow through on your layouts.
Did Brockway ever tell you where he got the idea that I wasn't stable?
No.
And that's my plan.
We're gonna show him just how stable you are.
We're gonna have the Christmas office party here tonight.
Uh, L-Larry, we couldn't do that.
I-I-I mean, n-not on such short notice.
I thought of that, Sam.
The caterers will take care of everything.
Oh, terrific.
What makes you think Brockway will come?
Well, that's just it.
When I told him that the party was here tonight, he said "yes" right away.
Seemed very interested.
Almost curious.
So we're gonna give him the works: eggnog, Christmas carols, the good-old Stephens' warmth and hospitality.
And at just the right moment, we'll tippy-toe into the nursery to look at those sleeping angels, and Brockway will sign right on the dotted line.
Uh, now, Tabitha.
I want you to close your eyes and wish real, real hard that you and Lisa would change back to normal.
I am going to try this spell from this book of incantations to counteract wishcraft.
Now, close 'em.
You too.
Tight.
Okay.
Warlock, wizard Behold these tots And hear my plea Out, out, darn spots Okay.
You can open your eyes.
Tabitha, are you really trying?
I think so.
There is nothing funny about this.
We know.
Can we finish our game now, Mommy?
What's wrong with the game we're playing?
I am outnumbered.
So I guess I'll just have to wait till the other part of my team gets here: Dr. Bombay.
Sam, what are we gonna say to the Wilsons?
I-I've got an idea.
Uh, we'll-- We'll take Tabitha and Adam and Lisa, and we'll get out of the country.
Darrin, that's kidnapping.
Oh.
Well, if worse comes to worse, uh, we can always tell them the truth.
The truth?
Sure.
They understand about minority groups.
I-I'll just tell 'em that I'm a witch and so is Tabitha, and Tabitha made a little mistake, and now Lisa's polka-dotted.
You're right.
Kidnapping is the only way.
Oh, sweetheart, that's Larry.
A-and don't worry.
Dr. Bombay has never let us down.
Perfect.
Perfect.
This will do it.
With any luck, we'll have Brockway signed and gift-wrapped for Christmas, hm?
What's keeping Sam?
Oh, uh-- Uh, she'll be down in a minute.
Mm.
Could be him.
I'll mingle.
Howdy.
All right, Darrin.
Welcome back.
What are all the cars doing out--?
Hey.
A party.
Hey.
How about that?
Oh, you shouldn't have.
But I deserve it.
I-it got transferred here.
Oh.
Here, let me take that.
Where's Lisa?
Uh, she's upstairs, asleep.
Oh, I'll take a look.
No, no.
I mean, uh-- Uh, Larry.
The Wilsons are here.
Excuse me.
Larry!
Welcome back, you two.
How you doing?
What's the good news?
The good news, she's-a good.
I knew you would do it.
Come on, come on.
I wanna hear every exquisite economic detail.
Excuse us.
I'll only go up a minute.
Yeah, no.
Uh-- Uh-- I mean I-- I have to tell you something first.
Is something wrong?
No, no.
Uh, the doorbell.
Ah-heh.
I'll, uh, answer the doorbell first, and, uh, then I'll take you upstairs.
Okay.
Yeah.
Well, M-Mr. Brockway, good evening.
Good evening, Stephens.
I, uh-- I trust there's no hard feelings.
No.
No.
Oh, say, I'd like you to meet-- And this must be Mrs. Stephens.
I met your little girl yesterday.
By George, Stephens, you're right.
She is the spitting image of her mommy.
Uh-- I want you to give this to her uh, from me.
And, uh, I brought this one for the other little girl.
Uh, Tabitha, isn't it?
And I-- I brought this for the little boy.
I wasn't quite sure whose side of the family he takes after, so I thought I'd just play it safe.
Uh, by the way, I want you two to know that I am for you.
Someday what you're doing will be accepted, I guess.
But by George, it sure takes a lot of guts.
Say, I think I'll get me some of that eggnog, all right?
Heh-heh.
Yes, sir.
Guts.
What was that all about?
He thinks you and I are married.
Where'd he get that idea?
Lisa must have answered the door when he came by yesterday.
So?
So she probably said that she and Tabitha were sisters.
Are they still going through that?
Which is why we're in this mess.
I could tell something was wrong.
Darrin, I want to see Lisa right now.
Uh, here you are.
Come on.
I want you to meet someone.
Not till I see Lisa.
Oh, worrier.
Come on.
It'll only take a minute.
Okay, Tabitha.
I have the cure from Dr. Bombay, and you don't even have to try to try.
Cat's paw Dragon's claw Combine in Delicate maneuver-- Wow.
This is better than television.
Lisa, we mustn't speak in the middle of an incantation.
Sorry.
Sam.
Cat-- Keith and Dorothy just arrived.
And Dorothy's on her way up here.
Mommy and Daddy are here?
Yeah-- S-so we'd better hurry.
But if you take away the dots, we won't be sisters anymore.
Tabitha, you can be sisters without looking alike.
But that girl in the park said that Lisa and me can't be sisters 'cause I'm white and she's black.
That's right, Mrs. Stephens.
That's what she said.
Well, she was wrong.
Now, sisters are girls who share something.
Usually, the same parents.
But if you share other things-- good feelings, friendship, love --the way you two do, well, that makes you sisters in another way.
Actually, all men are brothers, even if they're girls.
Well, I guess Mama would be kind of upset to see the polka dot.
Kind of.
I think they're ready now.
Okay, Tabitha.
Okay, Mommy.
But remember, we'll still be sisters, and you'll come visit.
All the time.
This is better than Disneyland.
Boy, that was fun.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
There she is.
Hi, Lisa.
Hi.
Hi.
Tabitha.
How are you?
Fine.
Do you mind, uh, equal time?
Hi, Daddy.
Hi, baby.
How are you?
Fine.
I had the best time.
And guess what?
What?
Mrs. Stephens is a witch, and so is Tabitha.
But they're good witches.
That's right, honey.
And you're our good little fairy.
Then, you mean it is not a mixed marriage?
That's what you thought?
Yes.
But now that you know the truth, you want Darrin back on the account.
Of course.
Excuse me.
I just want to make sure it's me talking.
It's me, all right.
Mr. Brockway, find yourself another agency.
We're not interested.
You're not interested--?
Huh.
Y-you mean, you're turning down a million-dollar account?
Believe me, I'm more surprised than you are.
You've got to be kidding me, Tate.
Nobody turns down a million-dollar contract.
Anyhow, you've got me all wrong.
Regarding the house rule against witchcraft I'm full of holiday cheer, so if you get the right cue Why, uh, some of my best friends are Negroes.
Why, I'd be the-- You all right?
Huh?
What's going on here?
What's the matter?
Is this some kind of a joke?
What--?
WhyI-I think I'd better be-- Be going now.
I'mfeeling a little strange.
Eh-- What was that all about?
I don't know.
But I think Mr. Brockway is dreaming of a black Christmas.
Here's the last one.
And it's for Lisa.
Thank you.
Ha-huh.
Excuse me.
Here you are.
Oh.
Mr. Brockway, this is a surprise.
Merry Christmas.
M-Merry Christmas.
Uh-- I should have called before I came over, but I was afraid you'd say no.
I had a very sleepless night last night, and well, I-I just had to come over.
Come in.
Thank you.
Oh, uh I don't want to intrude.
Come in.
Well, uh, everybody, look who's here.
Uh, merry Christmas.
Oh.
Mr. Brockway.
Merry Christmas.
Tabitha, uh, why don't you and Lisa take Adam upstairs?
Y-you can play up there for a while, okay?
Come on, sweetheart.
You can take your blocks.
Go on.
Go on.
I told Mrs. Stephens I didn't want to intrude uh, but I've got something I'd like to say to all of you.
A peculiar thing happened to me here last night.
The equivalent of 20 years on the psychiatrist's couch.
I discovered something about myself.
I found out I'm a racist.
A racist?
Oh, not the obvious, out-in-the-open type of racist.
Not me.
No, I was a sneaky racist.
I was so sneaky, I didn't even know it myself.
A very smart man said: "To adequately define the problem is the first step toward solving it".
Well I've defined it.
And I'd like to apologize for that other thing.
That  That misunderstanding.
There's really no apology necessary.
Thank you.
Well, I guess I'll be going.
Before dinner?
What?
Mr. Brockway you are invited to stay for Christmas dinner.
Thank you, Mrs. Stephens.
I'd like that very much.
StephensI wish I could talk you into coming back on my account.
This is Christmas, Mr. Brockway.
Business can wait.
I'll tell you, Mr. Brockway, a lot depends on how you do at dinner.
Hm?
We're having integrated turkey: white meat and dark.
Okay, come on.
Eggnog for everybody.
Let-- Let me have your coat.
Oh, thank you.
And your hat.
Thank you very much.
Here we go.
Excuse me.
Merry Christmas.
Hi.
We hope you enjoyed tonight's story as much as we enjoyed bringing it to you.
Oscar Mayer and Company, together with all of us on Bewitched, wish all of you a very merry Christmas, and a happy and peaceful New Year.

{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
"Wanted: contented secretary.
"Money no object.
Reward: a box of Bobbins Bonbons".
"Bobbins Bonbons"?
That was Mr. Bobbins' contribution.
Oh.
Hm-hm.
Well, I think it's a great idea.
We're also gonna work it into his television show.
Good morning, Samantha.
How nice to be alone with you for a change.
Mother, don't look now Abut that's Darrin standing in front of you.
Oh?
Oh!
Ha-ha.
One-dimensional objects tend to disappear into the background.
She's a laugh a second.
Uh, just relax, sweetheart.
I'll do better than that.
I'll go.
Good luck on the Bobbins account.
He'll need it.
What's that supposed to mean?
Would you like to hear an absolutely brilliant idea that just occurred to me?
Since you asked, no.
Giving secretaries candy is one of the worst ideas I've ever heard.
Now, this is my idea.
I have observed the mortal custom of giving a box of candy to mothers on Mother's Day.
Now, why not do the same thing on Mother-In-Law's Day?
Because there is no such thing as Mother-In-Law's Day.
Well, start a fad.
That makes as much sense as saying, if we celebrate Washington's birthday why not Benedict Arnold's?
And thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen, for tuning us in.
We'll see you again tomorrow Oh.
Bobbins' Sweetheart Parade is a good show, right, Tate?
Right.
It's got a lot of class.
And it gets good ratings, right?
Over 37 percent of the audience.
Okay.
So the show is good, it gets good ratings, but Bobbins Candies are not selling.
Which means I picked a good television program, but you guys come up with lousy commercials.
In all fairness, Mr. Bobbins, I'm sure-- And don't blame my candies.
You guys should come up with commercials that make people want to buy Bobbins Candy, whether they like it or not.
Mr. Stephens is my top man, and I'm sure he's doing his level best to come up with-- Where is Stephens?
Or aren't geniuses supposed to be on time?
Uh, I'm sure he'll be here any minute, Mr. Bobbins.
It's still a little early.
As far as progress is concerned, I'd say he's a little late.
Say, that's very good.
You do have a way with phrases.
Good morning, Mr. Bobbins.
You're late.
I thought I was five minutes early.
Wasn't the meeting scheduled--?
It's just a joke, Darrin.
What Mr. Bobbins means is it's late for him to be getting ideas, which should be-- How did that go again?
Forget it.
Tate tells me you've finally come up with an idea that's workable.
Yes.
And I, uh, hope you'll share my enthusiasm.
We all hope so.
We know that Bobbins already occupies a unique position in the confectionary world.
So it's been quite a challenge to come up with an arresting ad campaign.
I hope you're leading up to something.
I hear more harebrained ideas.
Do you know what my nephew came up with yesterday?
Listen to this: "Buy your secretary a box of Bobbins Candies".
Did you ever hear a worse idea?
Oh, well, my nephew is my problem.
You were saying?
I was?
Oh, yes.
I, uh-- Well, here goes.
Sprig of myrtle Dash of lime Let the spell begin At the sound of chime Pinch of basil Splash of wine The voice will be dum-dum's The idea will be mine Well, go on.
Go on.
Oh, yes.
Well, uh, the idea I had was-- What's the matter with him?
Well, you know these creative geniuses.
Very high-strung.
Ha.
Go on, go on.
That Bobbins create a national Mother-In-Law's Day and on that date, remind everyone to honor their mother-in-law with a box of Bobbins Candy.
A Mother-In-Law's Day.
Darrin, I think from now on, it will be necessary for us to collaborate a little more closely.
That is a sensational idea.
Like we did on this idea.
A national Mother-In-Law's Day.
This was worth waiting for.
Just how do we do it?
Why, we Tell him, Darrin.
You're pitching.
Mr. Bobbins, you just put your finger right on the reason that this idea does not work.
What?
Stephens is obviously suffering from overwork.
Uh, the point is, uh, we can't create a national Mother's-In-Law Day.
I mean, it would take a-- An act of Congress legislation, et cetera, et cetera.
So why don't we just forget it?
Forget it?
I like it!
But it's my idea, and you can't have it.
Why is it all these creative geniuses have a screw loose?
Larry's been phoning all afternoon.
He wanted you to call him as s-- Uh-oh.
You struck out, huh?
On the contrary.
I knocked the ball clear out of the park.
Mr. Bobbins liked the idea about the secretary?
He hated it.
What he loved was my idea about Mother-In-Law's Day.
Your idea?
That was zapped into my head by your mother, who was playing her usual game of dirty pool.
Well, sweetheart, w-why are you so upset?
I-I mean, even if she did do it, it was only to help you.
Which, apparently, she did.
Who asked her for help?
Uh, Darrin, will you stop being so irrational?
I will if you'll stop being so logical.
Where were you all afternoon?
I was in the park, wrestling with my conscience.
I-I realize you must have a-- A little conflict about using Mother's idea, but-- Not a little conflict.
A great, big one.
What are you gonna do?
I'm gonna answer the door.
And then work on it.
Mother?
Yoo-hoo, Mother.
I'd like to have a little chat with you.
About what, dear?
Dirty work at the crossroads.
Yours.
Come on in.
We've solved your problem, my boy.
Tell him, Tate.
It was your idea.
Okay.
Darrin, we found a way to-- We found a perfect way to make your Mother-In-Law's Day work.
Since we can't create a Mother-In-Law's Day, Bobbins Candy will create the Mother-In-Law of the Year.
Tell him how.
What we're going to do is find-- Find a suitable model and present her as Bobbins' Mother-In-Law of the Year.
Tell him where we're gonna make the announcement.
Heh.
Where else?
On the Bobbins'-- Bobbins' candy show, Sweetheart Parade.
Uh, that's really a great idea.
Great idea?
It's a stroke of genius.
And you can thank Tate for it.
Thank you, Tate.
Once and for all, I want you to stop meddling in his affairs.
Mother-In-Law of the Year.
What a wonderful idea.
How you gonna find her?
That's what I pay these fellows for.
My job is to make a better bonbon.
Spiders and bunnies That hippity-hop When my name Is mentioned Bobbins' heart will Flippity-flop Mercy.
I never dreamed you had guests.
Well, I'll just run right along.
Well, if you have to run right along, you have to.
Ah, Mother.
Hm?
You remember Larry, of course.
Oh, yes.
Nice to see you again.
A-and this is Mr. Bobbins.
How do you do?
Uh-heh-- Don't let us keep you, Endora.
Endora.
What a beautiful name.
Now I know how you got your idea for Mother-In-Law's Day.
It's obvious this lovely and charming lady inspired you.
Didn't she?
You could say that.
And you wouldn't be wrong.
There's something I've got to say.
Yes, Mr. Bobbins?
Please, call me Bernard.
I want you for Bobbins' Mother-In-Law of the Year.
Me?
Little me?
Oh.
Oh, I'm so flustered, I-- I-- I don't know what to say.
How about a short, pithy nonacceptance speech?
Why, Sam?
She's a natural.
Endora, you know you don't have time for-- Time--?
Oh, I didn't realize it was so late.
Will you be a dear and call a cab for me?
A cab?
Not bloody likely.
I'll be happy to personally drive you to the ends of the earth.
I'll be glad to drive her even farther, if necessary.
Come, dear.
Ta-ta, sweets.
M-M-Mother?
Nice meeting you, Mrs. Stephens.
Yes.
Mother.
Uh, since we came in the same car, I'd better be going too.
See you tomorrow, Darrin.
Ciao, Sam.
Oh, he's just dropping me off at my place.
It's-- It's just right down-- Bye, Sam.
Darrin.
Heh.
Sam what evil do you suppose lurks in the mind of your mother?
Darrin maybe she doesn't have an ulterior motive.
M-maybe she really is trying to help.
It doesn't make sense.
Why would she suddenly turn her back on everything she stands for and do something nice?
Darrin, you are talking about my mother.
I admire your loyalty.
But do you really believe, sincerely, in your heart and soul that your mother has my best interests in mind?
Would you rephrase that, please?
I'd like to be able to answer without lying.
Sam.
Well I know, I know.
You're right.
Thanks for your cooperation, Marvin.
Uh, Larry, this whole thing with Sam's mother.
Sam and I have been discussing it, and, well, it's not feasible.
What are you talking about?
Oh, I'm not gonna let you use my idea without taking full advantage of its potential.
Darrin, are you out of your tree?
Your secretary said to come right in.
Mr. Bobbins.
Heh.
Stephens and I were just buttoning up a few loose ends.
Good morning, Stephens.
May I call you Durwood?
No.
What?
My name is Darrin.
Oh.
I thought Endora said that-- Yes, she has a hard time remembering my name.
Ah.
Uh, Mr. Bobbins-- She was kind enough to accept my invitation to dinner.
I tell you, she's really an enchanting woman.
Uh, Mr. Bobbins, for reasons I won't go into I'm asking you to cancel the whole mother-in-law campaign.
He's rambling.
It always happens around this time of the year.
You know.
It's his hay fever.
Ha-ha.
Mr. Bobbins has already set the wheels in motion.
We've decided that Endora will be crowned Mother-In-Law of the Year on The Sweetheart Parade tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
That's right.
Ah, Mr. Bobbins, y-you don't know the real Endora.
Um, she's very shy.
Neurotically so.
Once she sees the audience, the cameras, she'll fall apart.
Look, I know what you're concerned about.
You think if she comes off badly, it will reflect on you.
Don't worry about it.
And one thing more.
I had a lovely evening with her, and I can tell you something: She is not shy.
Sam, why did you let me sleep so late?
Just look at the time.
Oh, yeah.
We're due at the studio in half an hour.
You should have awakened me.
Why?
So you could worry a little longer?
You didn't sleep half the night as it is.
You mean I slept half the night?
It's hard to believe.
Well, now, don't worry, sweetheart.
Mother promised me.
She should be arriving just about now.
I have a rule.
I always keep my promises.
You look half dead.
I suppose half isn't good enough.
Well, it's a start.
I may deliver the other half after the television show.
What television show?
What?
Mother what are you doing in that ski outfit?
I'll give you a hint.
I'm not going deep-sea diving.
Endora I got very little sleep last night, and I'm in no mood for jokes.
Darrin.
Yes?
She's not joking.
Mother, y-you cannot do this.
I have to.
I promised Peabody I would.
You remember him.
He invented thunder.
Be right with you, Peabody.
No.
Endora, you're not gonna get away with this.
You engineered this whole thing.
You're gonna stay here and do that TV show.
Coming.
Oh.
Peabody is so impatient.
Ta-ta.
Oh, I-- Oh.
Oh.
Sweetheart, you're not gonna do anything foolish?
'Course not.
There's a simple solution.
I'll just call Larry and tell him your mother can't make it because she's sick.
And believe me, there's nobody sicker than your mother.
Darrin.
I think I have a solution that will satisfy everyone.
What?
No, you won't like it.
Of course I'll like it.
I haven't heard it and I-- And I like it.
What?
I could go on that television show as Endora.
Follow me?
I do, and forget it.
Hello?
Where the devil are you?
And what's more important, where's Endora?
We've got to rehearse her, you know.
And the director's having a fit.
Ah, Larry, there's a little complication.
I've got him on the phone.
They're leaving right now.
Right?
Right.
Honey, as a good wife, how would you like to be my mother-in-law?
How's that for service?
Well.
How about a little kissy-poo?
Hmm?
Look, we-- We better-- There's only two minutes to air.
We'd better cut that mother-in-law spot.
Huh?
Well, I-I can replace it with some other piece.
I could fill with the Bobbins Buttery Bonbon bit we did last week.
Look, I don't know, Jim.
Excellent.
Excellent.
Yeah, beautiful, baby.
Get the Buttery Bonbon bit.
Jim, you'd better look it over.
This is really unforgivable, Tate.
It's not like Stephens at all.
Oh, here they come.
Do you know the panic you caused?
It's less than two minutes to air.
American beauties for the most beautiful American of them all.
Me?
Why, thank you, Mr. Bobbins.
Now, you promised not to be formal.
I mean Bernard, of course.
Mr. Bobbins, sir, if you will excuse me, there's just no time for this.
Ma'am, do you suppose you could read your speech off cards without a rehearsal?
Don't worry.
I'm sure I can handle it.
Oh, well, good.
Let's go.
And remember, there's no second chance.
Please, over here.
Kill that Buttery Bonbons bit.
We'd better get into the client's booth.
Come on, Darrin.
Camera 1, give me a head shot.
Camera 2, waist.
All right, would you just sit right down here?
Here, you take these.
Oh, yes.
Now, the announcer will say, "And here she is, the Mother-In-Law of the Year".
Music, music, music, and you're on.
Then there's a lot of applause.
Then you just read your speech off the-- Off the cards.
Cards?
You'll read your speech right off these cards.
These are the cards?
These-- They won't be here.
They'll be over there, where the cards are.
You can read them?
Yes, I think I can.
Good.
Now, where it says on the cards, "She takes a piece of candy," you take a piece of candy.
Right--?
From there.
Right from the Bobbins uh, "bonny-bonny" box.
Got it?
Yes, I do.
All right, minute-30 to air.
Minute-20 to air.
Psst.
Psst.
What's going on out there, Leo?
W-- Will you get her back on camera?
Where is she?
What's the matter?
Oh, well, I-- I told you she was the nervous, shy type.
She probably got stage fright.
Mother, what are you doing here?
Frankly, I resent your effrontery in trying to imitate me when, as everyone knows, I'm inimitable.
You're also a couple of other things, which I won't mention.
Leo.
Leo, can't you do something?
We're 35 seconds to air.
Mother, will you get lost?
I will not, Samantha.
If you insist on playing me, I will play you.
Who are you?
What are you doing here?
Why, uh-- Why, she's my daughter.
Yes.
I wanted to be with my mommy.
Well-- Do you realize we're a live show?
We've got 20 seconds to get on the air.
Would you get out of here?
Come on.
Wanted to be with your mommy.
Come on, please.
Just sit right down.
I know.
Look, now it's 20 seconds.
Read the cards.
All right, all right.
Oh, let's hope she stays there.
Yes, let's hope so.
Oh, Endora, you're too much.
Folks, we're taking a few minutes from Sweetheart Parade to pay tribute, long overdue, to a truly unsung heroine.
Bobbins Candies proudly presents the Mother-In-Law of the Year.
Thank you.
I can't tell you what a thrill it is for me to be here with you today.
As a simple, average mother-in-law, I'm especially thrilled that this honor has been accorded me, and I want to particularly thank the Bobbins Candy Company, who made this all possible.
Mmm.
And Bobbins Candies are so delicious.
And so fattening.
Uh, wh-- What happened?
But only if we piggy it up.
What's your wife doing there?
And what's she saying?
Uh, shh.
Be quiet.
You'll make Mr. Bobbins miss the surprise element.
But-- But-- Shut up, Tate.
I don't wanna miss the surprise.
And then somebody better explain the surprise.
Yeah.
And that somebody is you.
So a suggestion to all you sons- and daughters-in-law.
Pick up a box of Bobbins Buttery Bonbons.
If you can afford the ridiculously high prices.
Uh, naturally, Bobbins Candies cost more because only the finest, costliest ingredients are used.
I can't believe this.
You can't believe it?
Shh.
A final reminder.
If you honor your mother-in-law this one day-- You can forget about her for the rest of the year.
Uh, nothing like levity to spice up a commercial.
But-- But-- You're gonna miss it.
But a mother-in-law who is forgotten the rest of the year can become very angry.
Look, uh, check your montage amplifier.
That's the part I didn't want you to miss.
Ha-ha.
But a good daughter-in-law will always remember her mother-in-law on Mother-In-Law's Day with a box of Bobbins Candies.
I, uh, had them use a special lens on that technical stuff.
Heh.
Something I read about in an electronics manual.
Why didn't you mention this before?
Yeah.
Why didn't you mention this before?
Well, I told you, it was designed as a surprise.
From that point of view, it was a smash.
Darrin, I suggest you have a long talk with Samantha.
And then have an even longer talk with me.
That was a disgrace.
I thought it had impact.
A disgrace with a lot of impact.
It raised some negative ideas, but it shot them down with positives.
I hope you'll forgive us for our little surprise.
Heh.
Why not?
I think it was one of the most effective commercial messages I've ever seen.
You've got guts, Stephens.
Well, thank you, Mr. Bobbins.
But, uh, I had a lot of help.
Thank you, Darrin.
your wife and mother-in-law.
Don't you want to see the rest of the show?
I've seen the commercial.
That's the only part that interests me.
Camera 2 to Studio B for production number.
Sam you were terrific.
I was?
Oh, uh, Mr. Bobbins, I have a, uh, little confession to make.
The surprise element in the commercial, heh, was actually something that Samantha and her mother cooked up.
My dear girl, you and that mother of yours are to be congratulated.
Ordinarily, I don't like surprises, but this one certainly paid off.
Oh, well.
I especially liked the part where your mother-in-law turned into your wife.
Yes, that was my favorite part too.
Where's Endora?
Oh, uh, I-I can't imagine.
She was here a minute ago.
I-I guess maybe she had to leave.
Not without saying goodbye?
Of course not.
We'll find her.
Bye, Sam.
I don't think they'll find her.
I think she went back skiing with Mr. Peabody.
Thanks, Mom.
Well  adrianp55
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hi, sweetheart.
You're home early.
Hi.
I had to pick this up.
What is it?
It's a Reducealator.
A?
A what-alator?
Reducealator.
It's a prototype for a brand-new product.
And I've gotta come up with a mind-blowing ad campaign by the day after tomorrow.
How's it work?
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'll demonstrate it for you.
Don't go away.
Mommy, Mommy!
It's almost out.
Look.
Who tied the string onto it?
Sidney.
He was gonna pull it, but I didn't trust him.
You pull it, Mommy.
Oh Uh You've gotta be brave, Mommy.
Come on.
Oh, okay.
R-ready?
One, two I can't do it.
Maybe you better close your eyes.
Yeah.
Oh Oh, okay.
One, two  Okay, Sam.
Ooh!
It's out, Mommy.
It's out.
Look, Daddy.
Hey.
How about that?
How about that?
Can I go over and show Sidney?
Sidney?
Uh, y-you remember.
Mrs. Kravitz's nephew.
He's here visiting again.
Please?
All right, sweetheart, but come right back.
How does it look?
Well, I-I'm sorry, sweetheart, but it does take a bit of getting used to.
The great thing about it is it's completely portable.
Women can wear it while doing the housework.
Oh.
You can whittle away the pounds as you go.
Hey!
You want a good slogan for it?
What?
"Whittle while you work".
"Whittle while you work"?
I think it's cute.
"Whittle while you work"?
Forget it.
Mommy, Mommy.
I'm never gonna play with Sidney again.
Well, what did he do now?
He says there's no such thing as the Good Fairy.
He says it's the parents who put the money under your pillow.
That isn't true, is it, Daddy?
Well, uh, actually, uh Isn't it getting awfully hot in here?
Not for mothers.
Well, no wonder.
Heh.
I-I left this on high.
I'd better get out of this contraption.
Is Sidney right?
Do mommies put the money under your pillow?
Come here, sweetheart.
Tabitha, actually, you're both right.
It's all a matter of believing.
If you really believe and want the Good Fairy to come, she will.
Otherwise, mommies and daddies do her job.
Oh, goody.
That means the Good Fairy is coming here tonight.
Right.
Now, you run up and get ready for your bath.
Okay.
Good night, Daddy.
Good night, honey.
Sam.
Do you think it's a good idea to fill her head with all that nonsense?
What nonsense?
About the Good Fairy.
Well, for your information, it is not nonsense.
What?
No, I happen to know the Good Fairy personally.
Her name's Mary.
You mean, she's a witch?
No.
She's a good fairy.
Y-you You mean, with, uh?
With wings and a magic wand and the?
The whole works?
Of course.
You're not putting me on?
Witch's honor.
A simple "I swear" will do.
I swear.
Sam.
Uh, did you just hear something?
Yes.
I heard you wake me up.
I must have been dreaming.
As long as I'm up I think I'll go downstairs and get myself a glass of milk.
You want anything?
Yes.
I wanna go back to sleep.
Now, be quiet, and don't wake up the kids.
Ow!
Shh.
Shh!
Shh.
Sam?
Shh.
Sam.
Now, what is it?
We have company.
Oh!
Oh, Mary.
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, brother.
I knew it was a witch's house, but I had no idea it was yours.
Oh, uh Uh, ours.
Uh, this is my husband, Darrin.
Oh.
How do you do?
How do you?
Shh.
It's been ages.
Come on downstairs and sit a while.
I would love to.
You know, the cold bothers me more and more.
It seems to get into my bones.
How about a nice cup of tea?
I could certainly use something to warm me up.
I don't know about tea though.
Uh, coffee?
Coffee doesn't agree with me.
How about a drop of brandy?
What's brandy?
It's a very good warmer-upper.
Ooh!
Well then, that certainly should agree with me.
Come on.
Are you happy, my dear?
Very.
You don't miss the old life?
Well, I-I don't get a chance to.
The old life keeps dropping in here with amazing regularity.
Oh, how nice.
Here we are.
Thank you.
Mm-hm.
What's this called?
Brandy?
Yes.
How do you like it?
Very much.
Say when.
I hope you don't mind my popping in on you like this, Samantha.
But I really am so tired.
So I thought I would drop in to a witch's house and just rest up.
Oh, my goodness gracious.
Ha.
I forgot to say when.
Oh, well.
This has to keep me warm all night long.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
This is nice and warming.
Hah.
Uh Uh, Mary, why don't you let me fix you a little something to eat?
How about a nice chicken or roast beef sandwich?
I really should be going.
Roast beef?
I-it'll only take a minute.
Oh, well, I'll, uh, just put this back.
Oh, here.
You might as well take the glass too.
It's so good.
Oh, that's Adam.
I'll go up, Sam.
Excuse me.
Here we are.
I really should be leaving.
I just dread going out in that weather.
Although that brandy really did warm me up.
Sam.
Adam won't go back to sleep until Mommy kisses him good night.
Oh, uh, e-excuse me.
Uh, Sam.
How long is she gonna hang around?
Well, I can't ask her to leave.
I can.
You be nice.
Okay.
Okay.
Well, feeling a little warmer now?
Except for my toes.
Although I I really don't think I should have any more of that brandy.
As they say, if you're going to fly, heh, don't drink.
Hm?
It's a mortal joke.
Oh.
I like mortals.
They're They're so friendly.
You.
You have been very "hospid-ibidle".
Hospidib You're a good host.
It's my pleasure.
Far be it for me to spoil your pleasure.
Sure.
Here.
Hm.
Hey!
There go my toes!
Whee!
Uh, h-how are we doing?
You know, Samantha, you are married to a beautiful person.
A gorgeous, beautiful person.
I only wish I could get a gorgeous hunk of mortal like that for myself.
Uh Uh, Mary, I think you'd better sit down.
Nope!
Just beginning to feel the tips of my toes.
Watch this.
Stand back.
Stand back.
Ooh.
Did you ever see me do the White Swan?
Whee!
She's crocked.
Darrin!
The Good Fairy doesn't get crocked.
Hey!
How'd she get so crocked on just two drinks?
Mary, pull yourself together.
I-it's terribly late, and you said you had a long list of children to visit.
No.
Not going out in the cold.
B-but, Mary.
Y-you have to.
You're the Good Fairy.
All those children are counting on you.
Now, you can't disappoint them.
Why not?
What did they ever do for me?
She doesn't know what she's saying.
Here's a list of the children.
Never forget you for what you're doing.
What do you mean?
Doing what?
Oh.
Well Well, you You You don't think I'm gonna do it?
If you don't, kindly tell me who.
Well, well.
Th That does it.
Darrin, I have no choice.
I-I have to substitute for her.
Why?
Well, we're responsible for her condition.
She didn't even know what brandy was.
Someone's gotta make her rounds.
Mary.
Uh, Mary, wake up.
No.
Mary, please.
Uh, just so we can make the switch.
Okay.
Beautiful.
Samantha, you look absolutely, eh Well?
How do I look?
If anyone had ever told me that someday I'd be married to the Good Fairy, I'd have punched them right in the mouth.
H-how about a little kiss on the cheek instead?
Well, I guess I'd better give these wings a trial run.
Why do you need the wings?
Uh, can't you just?
The Good Fairy is not a witch.
And for the time being, I happen to be the Good Fairy.
She doesn't have the powers to fly.
That's why they gave her wings.
Who gave her wings?
Whoever gives out the wings.
Sorry I asked.
So as long as I have these wings on me, witchery is out.
Yeah?
It's almost worth it.
Tsk.
Abner?
Abner!
Oh, what is it?
There's a mosquito in Sidney's room.
Well, as long as it doesn't bite Sidney, it's got nothing to worry about.
Abner.
Abner, wake up.
Oh, what is it now?
Oh!
You should see this!
I-it It's Mrs. Stephens.
She's got this, uh, flimsy little thing on, like Like a ballet dancer.
A-and she's got these fake wings in the back, and Abner!
They're not fake wings!
She's flying!
Gladys, if you wake me up once more, you'll be flying too.
Oh, Samantha.
Oh.
H-how did you do?
Oh, fine.
Except I am exhausted.
Well, now you have some idea of what I go through.
Did you have any trouble sleeping?
It's the first good night's sleep I've had in centuries.
Do you have any idea what a relief it is not to sleep on your wings?
Yeah, I can imagine.
Oh, what a luxury.
Huh.
Can't do this with wings either.
Mary, I have to get my family up and start the day, so come on, let's change back.
Well, c Hurry up, Mary.
I have a lot to do.
Um Samantha I've been collecting teeth and giving out coins for centuries.
I'm sick of it.
If I never see another kid's tooth for the rest of my life, I'll be delighted.
Uh Well, what are you saying?
Don't you think I'm entitled to a little vacation?
Well, sure, but I'm Well, I'm taking one.
At least for a while.
And in the meantime, you're it.
But, well, you You can't do this.
I-I have responsibilities.
I-I have a husband and children.
Sure.
And now that I've unloaded this dumb job, maybe I'll get a crack at some of the goodies too.
You have no right to do this.
Maybe your husband has a friend?
Mary!
Sam?
What?
What?
What?
What's all the trouble?
Trouble?
Mm-hm.
Oh, no.
No No trouble.
Well, look, Sam, I'd like  What is she doing?
Scratching her back.
Uh Uh, look, Sam, I'd like to get to the office a little early this morning, so uh, would you mind, uh, getting out of that rig and making some breakfast?
Oh, well, I-if you're in a hurry, I won't take the time to change.
Uh, look, Sam if it's all the same to you, I'd rather you shed those wings right now.
Now?
Y-you mean this minute?
Mommy, Mommy.
Mommy, when did you get to be the Good Fairy?
Very recently.
Wow.
Wait till I tell Sidney.
Tab Tabitha, for the time being, I think we ought to keep this a family secret.
Gee whiz.
Everything good that happens here is a secret.
Oh, well, I'm sorry about that.
You run out on the patio and play.
I'll get you breakfast.
Okay.
Okay, Sam.
What is it you're trying not to tell me?
Maybe you'd rather hear it after breakfast.
Uh, if it's bad news, it'll sit better on an empty stomach.
Well, um Mary is being very obstinate.
She doesn't wanna be the Good Fairy anymore.
B-but you're a witch.
Uh, slap a spell on her.
Boil up a potion.
Fire a two-broom salute.
Darrin, there is nothing I can do about it.
Sam, this is the most ridiculous thing that's ever happened to us.
It's preposterous.
Why are you so uptight?
I'm the one that's stuck with these dumb wings.
Furthermore, you are just as much to blame as I am.
Well, Sam, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to yell at you.
But you've got to admit that this Don't do that!
I I beg your pardon?
Those wings are very delicate.
You've got to be gentle with them.
Suppose a man wants to hug you?
What do you do?
Nothing.
Now you know why they call me the Good Fairy.
Terrific.
Sam, what are we going to do?
You can't hide out forever.
Suppose somebody sees those wings.
Well you've always said that I'm an angel.
Now I'll look the part.
That's something I've always admired in you, Sam: The way you can smile in the face of disaster.
A little chill in the air this morning, isn't there?
It's the Kravitzes.
And Sidney.
Sam, quick, you better duck.
And take the Good Fairy with you.
Come on, Mary.
Come on.
No.
I'm not the Good Fairy anymore.
I'm staying right here to meet the people.
Oh!
Tell them she's my aunt, and get rid of them as fast as you can.
Hi.
Hi, Mr. Stephens.
Can Sidney play with Tabitha?
Sure.
Uh, she hasn't had breakfast yet, but Oh, that's wonderful.
Sidney, you just got an invitation to breakfast.
What do you say?
What are you having?
You'll eat what you get, you little Uh, Tabitha's out on the patio.
Oh, ha-ha, I didn't know you had company.
Uh, this is Mrs. Stephens' Aunt Mary.
Mr. and Mrs. Kravitz.
How do you do?
How do you do?
How do you do?
Uh, where's Mrs. Stephens?
Or, uh, isn't she back yet?
Uh, back?
From where?
Wherever she was going when I saw her last night.
In that funny costume with the wings.
Wings?
Uh, did she say "wings"?
Now you know what I have to go through.
And I saw her fly right up in the air.
W-was this late at night?
Very late.
Well, then that explains it.
Explains what?
How come you saw what you thought you saw.
Uh, things look very deceptive in the moonlight.
Exactly what I told her.
That's interesting because the moon wasn't out last night.
Sure.
It took one look at you and went back in.
Listen, if Sidney bugs you, don't hesitate to get rid of him.
I don't care how you get rid of him, just don't send him back to us.
Don't worry about it.
Come on.
Sam?
Samantha, this is getting impossible.
I'd finally gotten used to being married to a witch, but I never promised to love, honor and obey the Good Fairy.
Now, don't you worry, sweetheart.
I'll have a talk with Mary.
Mary.
Mary?
Mary?
Mary?
Where'd she go?
I don't know.
I was busy with the Kravitzes.
Oh-oh.
Y-you check the patio, I'll go upstairs.
Mary?
Tabs, have you seen the Good?
Have you seen Mary?
Yes, just a few minutes ago.
She said she was gonna take a little walk to warm up her toes.
What?
!
She went out the back gate.
Oh, no.
Mary.
Mary?
Your father gets excited a lot, doesn't he?
Only when the Good Fairy is here.
Calm down?
With the Good Fairy wandering around the neighborhood?
And with those cold toes, it won't be very long before she gets a loose tongue, and we'll be on television from coast to coast.
Not to mention pole to pole.
Sweetheart, I'm sorry I can't help you look for her.
You can help by keeping away from the window.
You come in here, and I'll prove it to you.
Boy, your whole family is freaked out.
I think I'd better go home.
I think my Aunt Gladys wants me now.
Uh Uh W Wait a minute, Sidney.
Uh, what do you think of this for a Halloween costume?
You're gonna wear it for Halloween?
Well, I thought I might.
What do you think?
I think you're too old to go out on Halloween.
Thanks, Sidney.
I needed that.
Don't miss "Mary, the Good Fairy, Strikes Again".
Next week on Bewitched.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Sam.
Just a minute, sweetheart.
How are you doing?
Not so good.
Sam, you've gotta get rid of those ridiculous wings.
Mary's being very obstinate.
She doesn't want to be the Good Fairy anymore.
How are you doing?
You may find this hard to believe, but it's next to impossible to concentrate on the campaign for the Reducealator when your wife is walking around with wings on her back and the Good Fairy's in the kitchen with a hangover.
Well, sweetheart, if worse comes to worse, you can always use the slogan I suggested.
Remember?
No.
And please don't remind me.
Sam, if you wanna help me, if you wanna save my professional life and my sanity, you'll talk some sense into that miserable Good Fairy.
Oh, now, sweetheart, don't get hysterical.
You cannot think creatively when you're all stirred up.
I'll go have another crack at Mary.
Mary, we have got to be sensible about this.
Now, I didn't mind substituting for you last night when you were crocked.
Hold it.
Let's not besmirch the name of the Good Fairy.
You gave me a few drops of that What did you call it?
Brandy.
Yes.
I just had a few sips to warm my bones.
And I got a little overheated.
You had four blasts and you were crocked.
Mary, I simply cannot let you unload your job on me.
In the first place, it eliminates my powers of witchcraft, and more importantly, I have a family and a husband to take care of.
Speaking of your husband, I think it was very mean of him to lock up that brandy.
Mary, do you have any idea what this is doing to my husband?
He is desperately trying to work, and you're not helping him one bit.
You want me to help him?
Yes.
Tell him to unlock the brandy.
Well?
What did Crazy Mary say?
I think the Good Fairy will be a lot easier to deal with if we give her just one little drink.
I'll agree to anything, if she'll agree to going back to being the Good Fairy.
I think a little drinkie-poo might just do it.
Okay.
Here's the key.
Mary, here's Mary?
Mary.
Ooh!
There's Mrs. Stephens' Aunt Mary walking down the street in a robe.
Abner, maybe I should invite her in and give her some of my chicken soup.
Your chicken soup?
Yes.
Why, Gladys?
What did she ever do to you?
She went out?
What do you mean, she went out?
She can't go out.
What What happens if?
Suppose Suppose she runs into one of the neighbors.
Uh, suppose she starts talking?
We'll be on the 6:00 news, coast to coast.
And in Europe, via Telstar.
Well, she can't have gotten very far.
You keep working.
I'll go look for her.
Sam, you go out like that and we'll have to move to a new neighborhood.
I take that back.
A new country.
Sorry.
I lost my head.
Mm.
You're right, Mrs. Kravitz.
Chicken soup is fine.
But I've discovered, there's nothing like a nip of brandy to really warm you up.
Darrin, Larry's on the phone.
I know what he wants.
He wants to know what I've come up with on the campaign for the Reducealator.
Well, I'll just have to bull it through.
And you'd better do something about covering up those wings.
I can't stand looking at them anymore.
I-I-I'll find something.
Hi, Larry.
How's it going?
Ha-ha.
You took the question right out of my mouth.
How you doing with?
The campaign on the Reducealator?
Larry, I-I'm on to something so terrific, that I don't even wanna stop to talk to you.
So, uh, goodbye.
Wait a minute.
We meet Ferber tomorrow, and he's not gonna be satisfied with a train of thought.
He's paying us for brainstorms.
Now, when are you coming in?
I'm not.
I'm on a hot roll, and I don't wanna blow it.
Goodbye.
Hold it.
Can't you give me some idea what it's about?
Larry, you're going to make me blow my brainstorm.
Goodbye.
This better?
It looks ridiculous.
Uh, how about a little more?
Oh, I really, really don't think I should.
Do you?
Be my guest.
Why, I certainly wouldn't want to offend my hostess.
I hope Mary hasn't gotten too far.
Y-You You better take the car.
Okay.
Y-You were the Good Fairy?
Well, excuse me.
Abner?
Did you hear what I just heard?
What?
You thought I was crazy, huh?
You know what she told me?
She used to be the Good Fairy, but now Mrs. Stephens is the Good Fairy.
Now what do you say?
Don't let her get away.
They have special rates at the sanatorium for double occupancy.
Uh, Mary, I was think Mary?
Mar?
Can we help you, ma'am?
Well, aren't you kind.
Yes, you certainly can.
Do you know what brandy is?
Yes.
And I have the feeling you do too.
Would you happen to have a drop on you?
Just to warm my bones.
What's your name?
Mary.
Mary what?
Mary.
Just plain Mary now.
But I used to be Mary, the Good Fairy.
Oh, you don't say.
And I used to be Charlie Prince Charming.
I think you better come along with us, ma'am.
I will not go with you, you fresh thing.
But I will go with you.
Fine.
We'll find a place that's, uh, nice and comfortable.
And will I get something to take away this chill?
We'll see what we can work out.
You are a dear man.
Sam?
No trace of Mary?
I searched the whole neighborhood.
Now, what are we gonna do?
Well, I don't know.
We can't call the police and report a missing fairy.
Hello?
Oh.
Oh, Mrs. Kravitz.
That's awful.
What's awful?
We don't have to worry about calling the police.
They've already picked her up.
Terrific.
Uh, why do you suppose the police picked my aunt up?
Do you know, Mrs. Kravitz?
Oh?
Well, I wonder how she got so much to drink.
Oh.
Well, you shouldn't have done that, Mrs. Kravitz.
My aunt has a little problem.
What do you mean, that's not the only problem she has?
Oh.
Uh, oh, yeah, well, all All that business about her being the Good Fairy is just a little joke of hers.
Thanks for letting us know, Mrs. Kravitz.
Goodbye.
What was she picked up for?
Probably drunk walking.
I better get right down to the station and see what I can do.
Maybe I could put on my shawl and go down to the station.
You could stay here and work.
Never mind, Sam.
Besides, I told you that, uh, we're not meeting with Mr. Ferber until tomorrow.
How thoughtful of Mr. Ferber.
Yes?
Mr. Ferber's here?
He can't be.
He is?
All right.
Ask him to come right in.
Mr. Ferber, come in.
Come in.
What a pleasant surprise.
We weren't expecting to see you until tomorrow.
Uh, Mrs. Ferber and I thought we'd fly in a few days earlier.
Take in some theater.
Good.
We can get you seats to anything you wanna see.
Tate, if I want seats, I'll go to a broker.
They rob you, but they produce results, which is more than I can say for your outfit.
Heh-heh.
Mr. Ferber, in all fairness, you are a day early, and, uh Yes, I know.
I know.
It's just that we're all anxious to get the Reducealator campaign started.
And, uh, I wanted to see what you fellas had come up with.
Yes.
Well So, what have you come up with?
As a matter of fact, I was talking to Stephens a little while ago.
And he's working on an absolutely sensational idea for you.
Really?
Uh, what is it?
I don't know.
He wouldn't tell me.
Did you try coaxing him, or offering him a lollipop?
Well, you know how far out these creative people are.
Ask him to come in.
I'm sure he'll tell me.
Well, that's the whole thing.
He was so caught up in the idea, he didn't even want to take time to drive into the office.
Now, that's what I call enthusiasm.
I call it insubordination.
If you're really anxious, I can have Stephens drive in.
What?
And stop the wheels of genius?
I wouldn't dream of it.
Good.
Then we'll wait till tomorrow.
No.
We'll drive out to the genius's house today.
Fine.
I was just gonna suggest that.
Okay, sir, she's released in your custody.
Oh, thank you, sergeant.
And, uh, we'll see that she doesn't run around loose anymore.
Well, just make sure she doesn't run around tight anymore.
You're so right.
Come on, Mary.
No.
That nice officer promised me I'd get something to warm my bones.
And I'm not leaving until I do.
Uh, Mary, this isn't a bar.
It's a police station.
Uh, come on, Mary.
Hm?
Uh, I'm sorry if she caused you any trouble, but, uh, she's been under a strain.
I understand.
I have the same problem with my Uncle Otto.
Well, um No, I-I'm sorry, Millie.
He's not back yet.
Well Well, he went out about half an hour ago on a little, um, emergency.
And, well Oh, hold Hold on.
Hold on.
Here he Uh, he Here Here he is now.
It's Larry's secretary.
She's called three times.
Oh.
Shh!
Shh!
Uh, here.
Uh, come on, Mary.
You We'd better go upstairs and lie down.
He Hello, Millie.
Y-Yeah, I'm sorry, but I had a little, um, emergency here.
Uh, what's up?
You're kidding.
You're not kidding.
Uh, well Uh, look, Millie, y-you've got to get to him and tell him not to bring Ferber out here because You They left 45 minutes ago?
Uh, g-good Goodbye, Millie.
Larry's coming here?
Uh, with the client.
Ooh.
Oh.
Oh, that can't be them.
Well, I suggest you don't, uh, wait around to find out.
Just disappear.
Darrin, you know my witchcraft isn't functioning.
Well, you've got those dumb wings.
Use them.
In broad daylight?
Some nearsighted duck hunter's apt to shoot me out of the sky.
Now, wait a minute.
Why?
Why are we panicking?
We just don't answer the door.
Later, you can tell Larry that you didn't get back in time, and I had to take the kids to To Ah.
I thought maybe you didn't hear the bell.
Uh, Mrs. Kravitz, we I, uh, saw you brought your aunt back.
How is she?
Oh, she's resting now.
What have you got on underneath that?
Uh, Mrs. Kravitz, I hope you won't take of fence, but my sense of privacy is greater than your sense of curiosity.
And we're expecting company.
Are you, uh, asking me to leave?
Oh, no.
I-I just don't want to detain you.
Here's your company.
I know you're in a hurry, Mrs. Kravitz.
I hope you can come back sometime when you can stay longer.
Goodbye.
And goodbye to you too.
Y-Yeah, okay.
Good luck.
Darrin, I tried to call you I know.
I know.
Oh, how are you, Mr. Ferber?
Well, considering the traffic, and the smog we had to cut through, not too good.
But Tate tells me you've got a great idea in the oven.
I'm sure it'll perk me up.
Uh, w-well, yes.
Heh.
B-But But at the moment, it's only half-baked.
If that's a joke, I don't get it.
It's a bad joke.
Darrin, are you set up in the den?
Uh, yes, but I Come on, Mr. Ferber.
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Ferber.
Uh Uh, well, I mean Well, I-it's It's against my principles to show unfinished work.
And Mr. Tate knows it.
Heh.
It's just not fair to me, and it's not fair to the ideas.
Did you drag me through all that smog for this?
Uh, Darrin, this morning you told me you were on the trail of a terrific idea.
And you didn't even want to stop to talk.
What happened to it?
I'm I'm still on the trail, and I'm still not ready to talk about it.
Is the traffic as bad on the way back?
Temperament.
Heh.
Just remember, I pay for results, not temperament.
Darrin, is that Larry you're talking to?
That's right, honey.
Well, ask him to come in.
What?
She wants us to come in.
Oh.
Sam.
Well, look at that.
Very good.
You sly devil.
Playing obstinate just to build up the suspense, eh?
Mr. Ferber, you'll never guess what's hidden under this Reducealator of yours.
One of the loveliest ladies I know.
Sam, this is Mr. Ferber.
Oh, how do you do?
Oh, Mr. Ferber.
Uh, Darrin and I were just doing a little research on your product.
He always insists upon that.
Well, that's the first thing I've heard today that makes sense.
Yes, I-I frequently find that actual use of a product will inspire an ad campaign.
Well, on to the inspirations.
What do you have to show us?
W-Well Incidentally, Mr. Ferber, uh, Darrin was explaining that you can wear the Reducealator while you do your housework.
Yes, that's the idea.
He said: "You can whittle away the pounds as you work".
Remember?
Oh, yes.
Uh, that's one thought I had.
"Whittle while you work".
Now, I know you fellas always pitch your second-best first.
So, uh, let's not waste time on strategy.
Ha-ha.
Mr. Ferber, you really know every trick in the book, don't you?
Okay, Darrin, give him number one.
Right.
Number one.
Well Uh M-My, this heat certainly gets into your bones, doesn't it?
Well, I-I think I'll go about my household chores.
Yes, I think that's a good idea.
Well, uh, no.
I-I'd, uh, like to get, uh, the woman's point of view on this idea of your husband's.
If, uh, you don't mind, Mrs. Stephens?
M-Mind?
Oh, heh, no, of course not.
I'd be happy to give you my point of view.
Oh, you have no idea how stimulating this is.
Yes, sir, Mr. Ferber, you You certainly have a hot little item here.
Well, now, you, uh, shouldn't overdo, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh Oh, no.
Uh, n-no, I'm fine.
Uh, really.
This is Is sort of a shakedown test on the Reducealator to find out j-just where the breaking point is.
Well, that's hardly necessary, Mrs. Stephens.
My Reducealator has been thoroughly tested in our research lab by our top technicians.
Really?
Oh.
Well, d-did a-any of them tell you how to get this little knob back on?
Do you mean it's broken?
O-O-Only the part that turns off the heat.
Come on, Stephens, let's zip her out of this.
No.
LARRY &  No?
Did I say no?
What I meant was yes.
Uh, let's get her out of there.
You should have spoken up, Mrs. Stevens.
That's right, Sam.
I know you didn't want to offend Mr. Ferber.
Offend me?
I'm not the kind of a man that What?
What's that she's wearing?
I don't get it.
Uh, w-w-well, uh, do you wanna tell them, Sam?
No.
It was your idea.
Well, o-okay.
There.
W-Well, she's the Good Fairy.
What's the Good Fairy got to do with my Reducealator?
I-I'm I'm coming to that.
Uh, here.
Picture this.
Uh, a-a pretty model, uh, wearing your Reducealator.
Hovering over her head is the Good Fairy.
And underneath, the slogan "Fly now, Reducealator".
Fly now?
You're joking, of course.
Not necessarily.
Uh, what exactly does it mean?
Well, uh If I If I have to explain it, I-I failed.
You failed.
But what exactly does it mean?
Well, uh Uh, fly now.
Uh, heh-heh Uh, l-live it up.
Uh, eat all you want, reduce later.
It makes a better mystery.
No, no, no.
It's an interesting notion.
It takes a second or two to grab you.
I like it.
You know something?
It just grabbed me.
You have a mighty peculiar way of doing business, Stephens, but I've gotta hand it to you, once you pitch, you really make an all-out effort.
You'd be surprised how much of that Sam is responsible for.
The way I feel about it is, the family that pitches together, stays hitched together.
Well, that isn't one of my best.
I'd say I'm sorry for barging in on you, Stephens, but, uh, heh, now I'm glad I did.
Oh, I'm glad you're glad.
Heh-heh.
We're going, Sam.
Oh, already?
I just fixed some bloody marys.
Hey.
Mr. Ferber?
Oh, thanks, but I don't drink.
Larry?
You must be joking.
You know I never touch the stuff.
Nice to have met you, Mrs. Stephens.
It's been a real pleasure, a real pleasure.
Nice to have met you, Mr. Ferber.
I'll see you out.
Bye, Sam.
Goodbye.
What's going on?
Why are your wings drooping?
Oh, they got a little steamed.
It's nothing to worry about.
They never looked like that when I wore them.
What's that?
Bloody mary.
What's in it?
What do you care, as long as it's fermented?
That's certainly not very Uh, Mary.
Uh, in all the excitement, there was something I forgot to ask you.
Yes?
Well, uh, do you think it would be all right if I started my rounds a little earlier tonight?
Before midnight?
Why?
Well, uh, last night I couldn't get to the last two children on the list.
You're joking.
Why didn't you mention it this morning?
I, uh I was ashamed.
You're not doing much for the image of the Good Fairy.
I'll drink to that.
Isn't it a little early?
Well, it's almost 4  Now look what you've done, clumsy!
So what?
I'll just toss it in the washing machine.
Are you mad?
That dress is made of spun milkweed.
You can't wash it in a washing machine.
Then how do you clean it?
You find a field of young wheat and you fly low over it, just letting the tips of the spears touch you.
And that brushes the dirt out.
Oh, I haven't got time to go to all that trouble.
I'll just have to make do.
Make do?
Make do?
You can't go out looking like that!
I have a reputation to maintain.
Mary, it is no longer your reputation.
It is mine.
And I will handle it as I see fit.
No, you won't.
You're You're fired.
Well!
If that's the way you want it.
It certainly is.
Huh.
I've learned my lesson.
If you have a job you love, you You have to do it yourself.
That's what I've been trying to tell you.
Well, I'm convinced.
Let's switch.
Right now.
Oh.
Uh, Darrin, are you sure you don't mind?
I'll get over it.
Ugh!
What a mess.
Ah, heh.
Ew.
Samantha, send me to the nearest wheat field.
Mm.
Oh.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Look at him.
He's a veritable bundle of ambition.
And while he snores away his life in this abysmal poverty pocket, your cousin is denied the rewards of a witchly heritage.
I never did dig what Sammy dug about that dodo.
Shh.
Samantha's coming.
What are you doing?
Trying not to wake you up.
You're trying too hard.
Oh, sorry.
That's okay.
I don't wanna waste my whole Saturday sleeping.
Why not?
There are some things I want to do.
For instance, fix the tile coming up in the kitchen floor.
It's fixed.
I did it the other day.
I was gonna do it.
I know.
I just got tired of tripping over it.
Sweetheart, there's something you don't understand.
You're not supposed to fix things around the house, that's man's work.
Even if the man's been putting it off for months?
That's the part you don't understand.
Putting things off is man's work too.
Oh.
Speaking of putting things off when do you suppose Mr. Ferguson's gonna trim that bush by our driveway?
It's a real menace.
You can't see the oncoming traffic.
I'll do the neighborly thing.
I'll get the shears and trim it for him.
Okay.
I'll fix you some iced tea.
Did you see what he's done to her?
She's not a wife, she's a full-time live-in maid.
You're right, Auntie, but what can we do?
How about turning him into a warlock?
What?
That's impossible.
So what?
The impossible just takes a little longer.
I never heard of a place that was too high to fly to.
Serena, this is the top of the world.
The atmosphere is much too thin for levitation.
Well, it's not too great for climbing either.
Hey, a-are you sure the old man of the mountain can do the trick?
Well, if anyone can help us, he can.
He's not only the oldest warlock in the world, he is also the wisest.
Greetings, master.
I seek the fruit of your ancient wisdom.
My daughter is married to a mortal who obstinately refuses to permit her to enjoy the benefits of her witchly heritage.
I seek a spell which will turn him into a warlock.
I think he's asleep.
No.
No, he's reflecting.
In the thousands of years in which I have sat here pondering the vicissitudes of the world, one truth above all others shines forth like a torch in a murky shadow.
What is that, master?
It doesn't pay to interfere with your in-laws.
I beg your pardon?
What's he smoking?
I didn't come this far for a lecture.
Do you know a spell, or don't you?
I'll have to give it much thought.
A few days, a week, a month.
Fine.
Serena, you can leave.
I'll wait until he thinks of a spell.
She's going and you're staying?
That's right.
I just thought of the spell.
Serena, you shock me.
We climbed all the way to the top of the world to get this spell and you're hesitating.
Don't you want to help Samantha?
Well, sure, Auntie, but I All you have to do is to go back to 14th-century Ireland.
Administer this potion to Durwood's ancestor, Durwood the Bold.
Add three hairs from his beard, heat it, and have him inhale the vapors.
It's all so simple.
So he inhales the potion, and that turns him into a warlock?
Right.
That will cause a change in his cosmic chromosomes and, simultaneously, Dumbo will inherit the powers of a warlock.
But Sammy will ask questions.
And I'll have the answers.
Are you ready for your journey into the past?
Okay.
Fire when ready.
Now for a little traveling music.
Night into day And day into night.
Back to the past With the speed of light.
To Durwood the Bold To do this spell.
I wish you luck.
If not, just yell  Oh, Endora, how infinite are thy gifts.
Enter.
There's a lady without, Master.
Without what?
Without a carriage wheel.
It came off directly in front of the castle.
How does that concern me?
It'll take at least a day to repair.
In the meanwhile, the lady requests the hospitality of the house.
What?
Does she take this for a hostel?
Tell her to be on her way.
Sure, I've done that, but she insists on meeting the lord of the manor.
She does, eh?
Gawain, you're too soft.
There's only one way to handle this kind of impertinent wench.
You're Darrin the Bold, right?
Right.
And you're the little lady who's going to be our guest for the next few days.
I was just passing by and thought I'd enquire if there's any little thing you might be needing.
Well, there is something you could do for me.
Aye?
I'd like a fire in the fireplace to warm this medicine.
Now, why would a lass as healthy as yourself have need of medicine?
I have a little chest cold.
Sure, and it's not medicine you want for that.
What you need is a warm-blooded Irishman.
It is lucky for yourself that your carriage broke down here.
A little further on, and you'd be at the mercy of roadway thieves, and heaven knows what sorts of evil types.
The question is, am I any safer here?
For my sake, I hope not.
Oh.
I thought you came in here to start the fire.
I am, lass.
No, that fire.
Oh, that fire.
No, I have to warm this.
Oh.
You're a fine broth of a girl, do you know that?
Come, give us a kiss.
I don't even know if you're married.
Are you?
Not seriously.
I don't suppose you'd care to explain why you did that.
In the land where I come from, it's a courting custom.
When a lady is interested in a gentleman she plucks a hair from his beard.
If she's very interested, she plucks two.
And if she plucks three Aye, what then?
Like, wow.
Sure, and I'm starting to like this custom of yours.
It makes it kind of a game, eh?
The suspense is killing me.
Are you gonna pluck the third?
Oh, and the saints be praised!
I feel terrible strange.
Sweetheart, would you like a cold drink?
You look pale.
You feel all right?
I'm fine.
I think.
How about a little iced tea?
Oh, thanks, but what I really want is some beer.
Sam, what's the big idea?
Darrin, I-I didn't do it.
What with you and the fire, it is getting powerful hot in here.
I wish I had me a tankard of ale.
How?
How did that happen?
From now on, you're going to get anything you wish for.
Anything?
Ah.
Watch what you're wishing for, buster.
You said I'd get me every wish.
You will, when it's my idea.
And I'm beginning to get some ideas.
Sweetheart, don't you think you're being a little unreasonable?
I mean, after all, the only thing that happened was you wanted some beer, and you got it.
Sam, I like the kind of beer that comes from the refrigerator, not from witchcraft.
Now, which wise guy, among the many in your family pulled this stunt?
Did it ever occur to you that maybe someone is just trying to be nice to you?
Well, let's find out who's being nice and tell them to knock it off.
Okay, I'll try and reach Mother.
In the meantime, how about a sandwich?
We have some nice corned beef.
Yeah.
A corned beef sandwich sounds great.
Sam, will you please hurry up and get your mother?
I have a feeling it isn't Mother.
It seems to be some sort of a-a wish spell.
You get whatever you wish for.
Yeah?
Well, I wish you'd call your mother and straighten her out.
As you wish.
Sorry.
Mother!
Having a little problem, darling?
Look, Endora, just admit you did it, and I promise not to get sore.
Darrin, let me handle this.
Mother, just admit you did it, and we promise not to get sore.
Did you put a spell on Darrin?
I did not.
Is that the truth?
Have I ever lied to you?
Mother, I didn't send for you to discuss your character.
Now, what's happened is that Darrin gets everything he wishes for.
It's happened!
I can't believe it!
What's happened?
Your father told me that this might occur.
But it was just too much to hope for.
What might occur?
Oh, darling, I'm so happy for you.
What's she talking about?
Well, this That's what I'd like to know.
Don't you understand?
It's the first stages of wishcraft.
No!
Yes.
Will you two stop discussing me like I was a piece of furniture?
What are you babbling about?
If you can muzzle him, I do have an explanation.
Darrin, please.
This is very important.
Yes, Mother?
There's never been a marriage of witch to mortal before so there's no precedent for this.
But what I think has happened is that as a result of Durwood's constant exposure to witchcraft, he's been absorbing it by osmosis.
And he's turned into a warlock.
Into a what?
Who?
Me?
No, no, no.
No, this is This is some kind of a joke, right?
And a bad joke at that.
Darrin, please calm down.
Mother, I think you ought to leave us now.
I think this is a very delicate time.
Samantha, this is a time for rejoicing.
We'll start rejoicing after you leave.
Sam, I never figured on anything like this.
I mean, I I don't think I can be something I'm not.
I can't live by whipping up this and zapping up that, and wishing up who knows what.
Sweetheart, l-let me try and explain something that might make you feel better.
Okay, but I doubt it.
Well, a-as time goes by and you mature What?
Well, I-I mean, as your wishcraft matures and you develop better control over your powers, all that accidental wishcraft will stop.
I was right.
I don't feel better.
Sam, are you sure this isn't some kind of a trick?
Not entirely.
Why don't you go outside and finish trimming that bush?
I'll try and get to the bottom of this.
That dumb bush is the least of our problems.
I wish I'd never seen it.
I don't know.
What I need is to be sitting quietly in a bar, trying to figure this out.
Hey, where'd you come from?
Just dropped in.
Well, uh, it was nice of you to bring your own beer.
Hello, is this the Elbow Room cocktail lounge?
Could you tell me if there's a Darrin Stephens there, please?
Oh, sure, I'll hold on.
Hi, coz.
What's going down?
Serena, am I glad to see you.
Uh, he's not?
Thank you.
Serena, something very strange is going on.
Oh?
Yes.
Darrin has been turned into a warlock.
Really?
And Mother has given me some trumped-up reason for it that I don't believe.
What'd she say?
Well, that doesn't matter.
What matters is it's causing a catastrophe.
And I think he's gone someplace to think.
And I think what he's thinking is thinking about going away.
Oh, Sammy, that's terrible.
Since when have you been so gung ho for Darrin?
Well, I know I haven't been too keen on him in the past but recently, very recently in fact, I met someone rather like him.
You did?
Where?
In the 14th century.
What?
And if your Durwood is as groovy as that Durwoo Oh.
Serena, there is something you're not telling me that you should be telling me, isn't there?
Yeah.
All right, out with it.
Sammy, if I spill it, your mother's gonna zap me into the 14th century permanently.
Which might not be so bad.
Ah-ha.
So my mother is behind this, isn't she?
Do I have to answer that?
No, you just did.
Oh, Serena, how could you?
Well, it sounded like it was gonna be a ball.
But it's turned into a real bummer.
Okay, start at the top.
How'd you know that's where it started?
Tell me, now, how would you like a little promotion?
To upstairs maid?
No, just upstairs.
Who are you?
On second thought, it is no matter.
You do look a bit familiar.
Wait a minute.
Of course, it is yourself.
But you changed your hair.
N-now, just take it easy, friend.
Friend, is it?
That's not what you called me scarce an hour ago.
What about me promotion?
I wish you to be off.
Do you hear?
I like what you did to your hair.
'Tis a well-known fact, blonds have more fun.
Sam?
Samantha?
This is going to come as a surprise to you, ding-dong, but am I glad to see you.
Serena, what are you doing here?
Minding the store.
Where did Sam go?
Out.
There was something she had to take care of.
How are you feeling?
I've got a miserable headache.
Oh.
And you're not helping it any.
I wish I had something that would.
Swell.
When will Sam be back?
As soon as she does what it is she has to do, which apparently she hasn't done yet.
Hmm?
Oh, hi, Mr. Ferguson.
What did you do to my bush?
Oh, that.
I just trimmed it a little.
You said you were going to anyway.
I said I was gonna trim it, not remove it.
What are you talking about?
Come with me, fella.
If that's your idea of a little trimming I'm gonna show you my idea of a little trimming.
Now, wait a minute, there's no need for violence.
I-I just got carried away a little.
That's right.
You're gonna get carried away, all right.
On a stretcher.
Oh, darling, how my heart longs for another taste of honey from them ruby lips.
You poor thing.
Oh, you poor thing.
You're overheated.
Aye.
And where there's heat, there is fire.
What you need is a little cooling off.
Now, I'm warning you, Ferguson.
You'd better not mess with me.
I have powers.
What you have is a screw loose.
I-I'm warning you, you're asking for disaster.
Sorry, but I warned you.
What did you do?
You did something sneaky.
I'll be right there, Martha.
Luckily for you, my wife's calling me.
I didn't hear anything.
Well, I did.
Sweetheart?
Darrin?
Sweetheart, There's something I have to tell you I found out it was a trick Sorry.
You first.
No.
No, you first.
Okay.
Sam, I thought it all out.
I've gone over it over and over again, and the truth is it doesn't matter about the witchcraft, or whether or not I'm a warlock.
The only important thing is that I love you.
And I love you.
Now, what did you have to tell me?
We were right.
All that warlock nonsense was a trick, and now you're unstuck.
I-I mean, your wishcraft is gone.
Really?
That's terrific.
But just a minute ago, I got in a row with Ferguson I know.
I ran a little interference for you.
So sue me.
Sam, are you ready?
Coming.
Sweetheart, I got a sitter.
She'll arrive just as we're leaving.
You won't even have to see her.
Meaning?
Meaning the only person I could find was Mother.
Suddenly, going out for dinner together loses its charm.
Who would know better about lack of charm than you, dumbo?
Oh, Darrin.
If you just hadn't said anything she wouldn't have come in until after we'd left.
I didn't think you'd have the gall to show up here after what you pulled today.
That's the thanks I get for trying to elevate your station in life.
Endora, from now on, do me a big favor: Don't do me any favors.
Mother, you can do me a favor.
Wanna go upstairs and play with the kids?
They're waiting.
Gladly.
Sweetheart, I-I know it's hard to believe, but she means well.
You're right.
It's hard to believe.
Which reminds me.
Just exactly what did she do and how did you undo it?
Well, I'd rather that wait until you've had a good dinner and a good night's sleep, have gotten up and gone to the office, because I don't want you to be around when I tell you.
You're a sneaky witch.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Ouch.
Ouch!
Did you say something, Sam?
Uh, no.
No, I didn't.
But he did.
Sammy, how can you hit a man when he's down?
Get it?
Pillow, feathers, down?
I guess it's true.
Small things amuse small minds.
How would you like to pick on somebody your own size?
Okay, Digby.
Start picking.
Uncle Arthur, please.
What's it gonna be, fisticuffs?
Now, just  Uncle Arthur, will you cut that out?
Oh, Sammy, I'm just jousting with him.
Sam, tell him to get me out of here.
If I were you, Digby, before I got in the office elevator, I'd, uh I'd check my lance.
Uncle Arthur!
There you go.
Back to normal, whatever that is.
And to think some people, before they go to work, just have coffee.
Uh, sweetheart, I-it's after 2:00.
You'll be late for your meeting.
Oh, that's right.
What with all the fun and games, I almost forgot.
Uh, aren't you gonna say goodbye?
Yes, I am.
Goodbye.
And the next time you drop in, don't.
Watch it, buster.
In a war of wit, you're unarmed.
Sam, this dinner tonight for Mr. and Mrs. Rockfield is not social.
It's business.
I know.
And Larry will be coming, so that'll make five for dinner.
Not six.
Don't worry, sweetheart.
Hmm.
All right, Uncle Arthur.
Let's have it.
Have what?
An explanation.
Digby deserved ev Ah, that is not what I'm talking about.
How come you're all spruced up?
It's the new me.
Love it or, uh, leave it.
I'm leaving it.
Uh, Sammy, it's all part of the new me.
The simple, carefree, fun-loving, practical-joking Uncle Arthur is gone.
Y-You mean all those stunts you pulled on Darrin were my imagination?
Just the last of a long line of memorable funnies.
My glorious transformation can be attributed to one word: Aretha.
Aretha?
Aretha, my love, I worship at your feet.
Fly to my side, and make it tout suite.
Arthur, darling, how thoughtful of you to call.
Oh.
Mmm.
Finger-lickin' good.
Oh Oh, Samantha, allow me to introduce Aretha, the love of my life.
The witch who will soon be.
Mrs. Uncle Arthur.
Oh, that's marvelous.
Aretha, I'm so pleased to meet you.
Charmed, I'm sure.
I'm sure.
What a quaint little place.
Absolutely charming.
Where's the main house?
This is it.
Where do the servants stay?
Well, we don't have any servants' quarters, since we don't have any servants.
Oh, sounds like fun.
If my hands weren't so delicate, I would consider trying it myself.
Aretha, my sweetness.
Your loveliness is only surpassed by your understanding.
Oh.
That's not quite the word I would've used.
Sammy, I  Sam, I I think I'd like to talk to you in the kitchen.
Uncle Arthur, what's the matt?
Sammy.
For you.
Oh, thank you.
They're beautiful.
Smell them.
I'm sorry, Sammy.
I just couldn't control myself.
I'm having a lot of trouble myself.
You don't understand.
My problem is Aretha can't stand practical jokes.
They They're below her station.
Oh.
If she knew I were the titan of tricks, the highness of hijinks, the prince of pranks, why, she'd drop me like a hot potato.
How long are you gonna carry on this masquerade?
Forever, if necessary.
One of these days, you'll just lose control right in front of her.
Never.
I love her.
The masquerade goes on.
Here we are, my treasure.
Miss me?
Arthur, let's talk about our honeymoon.
I do hope we can go to a fun place.
I've been thinking that maybe we could go to India for some elephant polo.
Oh, Arthur, it's so hot in India this time of year, what with all those untouchables milling about the streets.
Arthur, I mean I know a place where you can go.
Thanks, Sammy, but we still haven't run out of our own ideas.
I've got it.
The perfect place to honeymoon.
We'll have complete privacy.
We'll take a trip to the moon on gossamer wings.
What are you doing with those wings on your back?
W-Wings?
What What wings?
Arthur, I would be much happier if you would quit that clowning around.
You, uh, would?
U-Uncle Arthur.
I think you would be happier if you'd clown around a little more.
Arthur!
Get me out of this ridiculous costume!
You You clown!
It takes one to know one.
Uncle Arthur, I think it's time you stopped clowning around.
Clowning around.
Oh, Sammy, you do have a way with words.
Arthur, I'm warning you.
Cut out this nonsense.
Uh, oh, all right, killjoy.
Arthur, you are a silly, witless fool.
However, there is one consolation.
I found out in time.
Oh, Sammy.
You're looking at a broken warlock, rejected and shattered beyond repair.
I'd turn myself into a doormat, except the way I feel, I couldn't stand the word "Welcome".
Oh.
Well, I-in a few thousand years, you will have forgotten all about her.
I know.
But what am I gonna do tonight?
Come on.
Come on.
Give me a hand.
Rockfield will be here any minute.
What's going on?
Just a little one-upsmanship.
Putting Rockfield's furniture where it will do the most good right before his eyes.
Where do you want this, Mr. Tate?
Oh, here.
I'll take it, Betty.
Thanks.
The right bait for the right catch.
Okay, Darrin, let's hear your ideas.
He'll be here any minute.
Okay.
But I could have come up with some angles I like better if I'd had more time.
Let me remind you, this is the advertising business.
Whatever you come up with, you love.
Yes?
Mr. Rockfield's here.
Show him in.
Ah, ha, ha.
Mr. Rockfield, good to see you.
Come on in.
Hello, Tate.
Darrin, shake hands with Lionel Rockfield, king of home and office furnishings.
This is Darrin Stephens, the creative mainstay of our team.
It's a pleasure to finally meet you, Mr. Rockfield.
I've heard a lot about you.
Yes.
Would you like to sit down?
Uh, no.
I've been sitting all day.
Oh, no.
Here.
Here, use this.
Uh, never mind.
I'll use the one here on the desk.
All right, Tate.
I understand you've got some campaign ideas you want me to hear.
Absolutely.
Go ahead.
Mr. Rockfield I'm listening.
At McMann and Tate, time is money, both for the client and the agency.
Go ahead, Darrin.
Well, the first idea is a beauty contest Miss Secretary of the Year and the winner would be pictured sitting in a Rockfield chair at a Rockfield desk.
I don't like it.
It's been done a million times.
It's old hat.
Right.
It's off with the old and on with the new.
Proceed, Darrin.
We thought of an institutional approach.
Pick five colleges and furnish the president's offices with Rockfield furniture.
It'd be like a grant.
I don't like it.
It's too obvious.
And so are you, Tate.
What?
Just because you put a Rockfield chair and lamp and ashtray in your office doesn't mean you're gonna land the account.
Well, I never dreamed I don't fall for that kind of bait, Tate.
I take my business very seriously, and if you don't, I'll take my business elsewhere.
Oh, we do.
We do.
And we have a lot more ideas.
But why don't we present them tonight at dinner, when we'll all be a little more relaxed?
All right.
But you better come up with something a more effective than I've heard here today.
And, uh, don't count on me being too relaxed.
I take pride in never getting too relaxed.
You heard what he said, so you better come up with something terrific or it's curtains.
And I don't mean Rockfield curtains either.
Uncle Arthur, you have been moping around the house all day long.
Now, Darrin will be home any minute.
So, please, try and pull yourself together.
But my life has no meaning.
I have loved and lost.
Oh, my stars.
Uncle Arthur, you haven't lost anything.
You force me to be honest.
Aretha is a phony.
And so are you for pretending to be something you're not.
What am I?
A broken-hearted clown!
Laugh, clown.
No one knows your heart is broken.
Even though You're only Make-believing Laugh, clown, laugh Oh, brother.
Even though Something inside Is grieving  Laugh, clown, laugh Sammy, I've got it.
You're gonna forget about Aretha.
No, I'm going to win her back.
And the only way to do it is to get rid of the one thing that's standing between us.
My character.
Your character?
I'm going to say goodbye to my practical jokes.
I will scatter them to the winds.
How are you gonna do that?
Never mind, Sammy.
Go check your dinner.
You needn't be concerned about me anymore.
Why scatter my practical jokes to the winds when they'd be much more at home right here?
Practical jokes my love appalls, fly from my body and lodge in these walls.
Au revoir, Sammy.
The joke's on you.
Uncle Arthur?
Uncle Arthur.
: Uncle Arthur?
Uncle Arthur.
Oh.
Uncle Arthur!
Uncle Arthur!
Oh.
Oh!
Good grief.
: Oh!
Uncle Arthur!
Knock it off!
Sam?
And what, may I ask, is this?
I think it's water.
So much for the water.
Now where's the scotch?
Sam, I'm very calm now.
If I were you, I'd take advantage of this calm state by explaining what kind of a way is that to greet a husband?
Oh, dear.
Is that better?
It's better, but it's still not an explanation.
It's Uncle Arthur.
I know that.
But what you don't know is that Uncle Arthur is madly in love with a witch who can't stand his practical jokes.
The ranks are swelling.
And in order to win her, he divorced himself from his practical jokes.
Well, that's an improvement.
And apparently we got custody of them.
That's not.
Sam, now, our guests will be here any minute.
I mean Well, you're a witch.
Do something.
Well, there's nothing I can do.
There.
Here's to tonight.
Let's hope it's nothing like this afternoon.
Brace yourself.
Oh, good evening.
Please come in.
Good evening.
How do you do?
Samantha, uh, this is Mr. and Mrs. Rockfield.
How do you do?
Folks, this is Samantha, Darrin's lovely and charming wife.
Oh, Larry.
My goodness.
Oh, well.
How about some drinks?
I thought you'd never ask.
Good.
Come right in.
We're so thrilled you could come.
What was that?
Uh, uh, just a draft.
It's a very drafty house.
I-I'll call the draftsman in the morning and get it fixed.
W-Why don't you call whoever you have to call right now, Sam, just so it doesn't happen again?
G-Good idea.
You can use the phone in the kitchen.
Excuse me.
Well, what are we drinking?
Well, uh  Mrs. Rockfield and I will have ginger ale.
You sure you don't want something stronger?
We're sure.
Too bad.
Come on in.
Uncle Arthur, I am going to count to three, and if you know what's good for you, you will gather up all your practical jokes and absorb them.
One, two, three.
Four?
Five?
And here we are with the drinks.
Oh.
The ginger ale for the Rockfields, and the scotch for Larry.
Stephens, I I don't seem to be able to raise my glass.
Neither can I. Neither can I. You can't, huh?
Probably the furniture polish hasn't dried on the table yet.
I'll have them pried off tomorrow.
No problem.
I'll make new drinks.
Hmm.
Certainly getting hot in here.
Darrin, we're waiting for our drinks.
Didn't you have a drink for lunch?
What's the matter with you?
Me?
Nothing.
Nothing.
I'm fine.
Uh, say, have you ever seen the handkerchief trick?
It's It's really, uh, very amusing.
Darrin, forget the trick.
Let's talk about the campaign.
What have you come up with for Mr. Rockfield?
Uh, yeah, the campaign.
Oh, of course.
Uh, well.
Uh Well, let's hope it has plenty of punch.
Uh, I'll go get a cold compress.
I'll be right back.
Uncle Arthur, I'm gonna start over again, and if you're not here by the time I count to three, you've had it.
And so have we.
Sam, what's happened?
Well, apparently Uncle Arthur's made up with Aretha, and has given us back his practical jokes.
What's that for?
For me first, and then for Larry.
One, two, three.
Mr. Tate.
Here.
This should do the trick.
Are you all right, Tate?
He never could take a punch.
Where am I?
Well, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were in a loony bin.
Ah, yes, this certainly promises to be an interesting evening.
More fun than a barrel of monkeys.
Cute little fellas, aren't they?
Stephens, where'd these animals come from?
Yeah, where'd they come from?
Well, actually Never mind.
Just get rid of them.
Oh, they're cute, Lionel.
Where's your sense of humor?
I don't see anything funny about a room full of anthropoids.
Uncle Arthur, you cut out the monkeyshines and undo your spell.
Heigh-ho, Samantha, my sweet.
Don't "heigh-ho" me.
You and your practical jokes are destroying us.
Oh, cute little fellas, aren't they?
Not to me, they're not.
They are ugly little beasts, no cuter than your practical jokes.
Arthur, we are finished for all time.
And if I never see you again, it will be too soon.
Goodbye.
You're right.
She's a phony.
Stacked, but a phony.
I demand an explanation.
And it better be a good one.
Good?
It's gonna have to be great.
And you're going to get it.
In just a minute.
A-And get rid of these monkeys.
Oh, sure thing.
Uncle Arthur, I beg of you.
Please undo your spell.
Why not?
I've lost my love again.
That's not all you're gonna lose.
Shh!
Uh, Mr. Rockfield, I'm sure Stephens has an explanation.
Practical jokes, return to the roost, and give Uncle Arthur a great big boost.
And as soon as he gets back, he'll get rid of the Where'd they go?
Okay, Sammy?
Ciao.
It's time to face the music.
Well, you asked me to get rid of the monkeys, so I got rid of them.
Oh.
Oh.
You promised an explanation, a good one A very good one.
Well, go Go ahead, sweetheart.
Tell 'em about your plan.
Don't be modest.
Plan?
Well, you know.
The The plan to show that you can enjoy your home without making it a Coney Island fun house.
Oh, of course.
That plan.
Darrin always says that a home can be fun without air blasts or sticking glasses or barrels of monkeys.
Or even a boxing glove.
Maybe later I'll explain how much fun that was.
I hope there's more.
Of course.
We show the Coney Island fun house, and next to that a home furnished with Rockfield furnishings.
And the slogan might be, uh, "Put some fun in your home with Rockfield furnishings".
That's your explanation for everything that happened tonight?
Uh-huh.
I like it.
I like the approach, and I like the slogan.
I knew you would.
I'm crazy about it myself.
Well, you must admit, it does have punch.
It's different.
But you certainly went to a lot of trouble to make your point.
Well, would this moment have been as meaningful if Darrin had just said "fun house"?
No, it wouldn't.
Mrs. Stephens, your husband's got quite a head on his shoulders.
I certainly have.
Sam, this is one evening I'll never forget, even if I tried.
And I plan to do a lot of trying.
Well, I'm very proud of you.
You were in control all the way.
Control?
I was in shock.
Well, sweetheart, the house is back to normal.
Yeah?
For how long?
Your lovesick, joke-sick Uncle Arthur just might Shh!
He's liable to hear you.
I heard that.
He heard you.
Uncle Arthur, go away.
Ouch!
Sammy, you know if there's one thing I can't stand, it's having my ear tweaked.
How about boxed?
Now, there's an idea.
Woo-hoo!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
All done, Mommy.
Can we go play now?
Not until Adam finishes his milk.
I'm gonna go out and get the newspaper for Daddy.
And when I come back, I want that cup of milk to be empty.
You understand, Adam?
Don't worry, Mommy.
He'll do it for me.
Adam.
Go ahead, Adam.
Drink your milk.
Milk, up.
Go ahead.
The rest is up to you.
I wanna go out and play, and if you don't empty that cup, I will.
Cup, go.
Tabitha, put that back.
Tabitha, that was naughty and you know it.
It wasn't my fault, Mommy.
You scared me and broke my spell.
You shouldn't be doing spells.
Honey, breakfast ready?
Uh-oh.
In a few minutes, sweetheart.
I'll get it.
We'll discuss this later, young lady.
Now, I better clean this up before your daddy sees it.
You turn the other way.
You too.
What's wrong, Mommy?
I don't know.
Never mind, Tabitha.
Now, why don't you two go out and play?
And, Adam, you will have two cups of milk for dinner.
Okay, Mommy.
Hi, little cousin.
I see you're still working hard on housemaid's knee.
What's the matter?
Super-boob too cheap to hire a maid?
Just had a little accident.
And frankly, Serena, I prefer to do things the mortal way.
Especially when your witchcraft doesn't work.
Tabitha, will you please take Adam out on the patio and play?
Okay.
Come on, Adam.
Just a minute.
What was it Tabitha snitched about?
I don't know what's wrong.
I seem to have a pooped twitch.
How long has it been since you've had a checkup?
I mean, the full Well, it's been a long, long time probably.
Sam, that was Larry on the phone, and for some For some reason, he wants to pick me up.
And you can forget about breakfast.
I've just lost my appetite.
Well, I see tall, dark and nothing is as nothing as ever.
Never mind, Serena.
Sweetheart, I think I have a little problem.
I know.
When did she get here?
Ding-dong, when it comes to dense, you go to the head of the class.
She's sick and she needs a checkup, and yesterday wouldn't have been too soon.
My witchcraft has gone fluey.
It could be serious.
What can you do about it?
Well, I should go in for a full checkup and rehabilitation.
Well, how long would you be gone?
Oh, I should be back by 9 tonight.
Serena, could you stay with Adam and Tabitha?
Of course.
Sam, couldn't you get Esmeralda or your mother or?
There isn't time.
Give me a boost, Serena.
Weebus worbus Toodle-flick.
Get a checkup or you'll be sick.
Alone at last.
That must be Larry.
Do me a favour.
Uh, stay out of sight.
Sure, poopsie.
Good morning, Darrin.
Good morning.
Uh, hadn't we better get going?
We'll be late.
Darrin, how can you be late?
You're with the boss.
Uh, Larry, is there some special reason why you want me to drive in to work with you?
Yes.
My seat belt's broken and I want you to hold me in the car.
I finally arranged a meeting with Mr. Berkley of Berkley Hair Tonic for this afternoon.
Forget it.
Who needs a hair tonic account at a time when nobody is buying hair tonic?
But that's the point.
When the sales are slipping, opportunity knocks.
There's no way to go but up.
Let's make sure that the client understands that.
You'll make that perfectly clear, but not too clear.
And if there are any loose ends, we'll sew them up tonight at dinner.
Oh, that would be a good idea, but I'm afraid Sam and I can't make it.
Can't make it?
You're the hosts.
Forget it, Larry.
Sam's not here.
She went out of town to take care of something, and, uh, she won't be back till after dinner.
Sweetheart.
Let's go.
Hi, Larry.
Sam?
Oh, Darrin, I'm so glad I caught you.
Darrin, that really wasn't worthy of you.
If you don't want the client to come for dinner, just say so.
I don't want the client to come here for dinner.
Sam, Louise is away visiting her mother.
And if it isn't too much of an imposition Imposition?
Oh, my goodness.
Of course not.
We would love to have Mr. and Mrs. Berkley here for dinner.
Wouldn't we, sweetheart?
Uh, Larry, why don't you go along without me?
Oh, now, don't worry about me, Darrin.
You and Larry run along.
That's right.
Let's run along, and fast.
I'll be home early.
Very early.
I can hardly wait.
Aren't you forgetting something?
I don't think so.
Darrin, give her a kiss goodbye and let's go.
How long have you two been married?
Seven years.
Remarkable.
What's a gorgeous girl like you doing in a face like this?
Oh!
Fantastic!
Darrin, I talked to Berkley a while ago, and I think he and his wife are going to accept your gracious invitation to dinner.
He should be here any minute.
You have something dazzling to spring on him?
Well, not exactly dazzling, but I do I think I have something sensational.
"Berkley's Hair Tonic.
It makes your hair and your love life easier to manage".
I don't like it.
Mr. Berkley!
Ha-ha-ha.
Good to see you.
That slogan is not for my product.
Of course it isn't.
It's old hat.
But I was just trying to show Stephens here an example of the wrong way to go.
Well, that's right.
It's wrong.
Heh-heh!
Uh, Mr. Berkley, this is Darrin Stephens, our top man.
Nice to see you, Stephens.
Thanks for the invitation to dinner.
A little short notice.
Hope the little lady didn't squawk.
No, not at all.
Good.
Neither did mine.
And believe me, she's a great little squawker.
I understand you have something exciting to talk about.
I am aware that your sales have slipped considerably and it's just because the kids are not buying hair tonic.
It's a sign of the times.
Oh, that's very astute.
Very astute.
You've just told me what my Research Department told me six months ago.
Stephens, it is not your job to report on the state of the union.
Your job is to come up with ideas which sell my hair tonic.
Yes!
What I want is action.
And y-you're going to get it.
All I want is enough time to come up with the plan for recapturing the youth market.
Okay, take all the time you like, as long as you come up with an idea by tonight.
Gentlemen.
Oh, uh, by the way, thanks again for the invitation to dinner, Stephens.
Okay, sweetie.
Adam's down for his nap.
What kind of a game would you like to play?
What's that noise?
It's the telephone.
There's one in Mommy and Daddy's room.
Oh!
Well, there's one in here too.
Hello?
Uh, hi, Serena.
I'm just checking in to see if everything's all right.
Everything's fine.
It's your daddy.
Adam is taking his nap, and Tabitha and I were just about to play a game.
Game?
What kind of a game?
Well, I thought it might be fun to play Catch a Falling Star.
Serena, can't you play regular games like other people?
I am not like other people.
Neither is Tabitha.
Serena, would you do me a big favour?
It depends.
Is there any way you can reach Samantha and get her back here in time for dinner tonight?
Nope.
When a witch goes in for the 10,000-spell checkup, she is incommunicado.
Say bye-bye to your daddy.
Bye-bye, Daddy.
I know a game we can play, Auntie Serena.
Hide-and-seek.
Neat-o!
Well, we need a whole bunch of us for that.
Oh.
I bet they'd love to play.
And Prince and Panda and Fuzz.
And you too, Rag Doll.
There.
This is gonna be fun.
Now, we are all going to play hide-and-seek.
Scoot.
Come on, gang.
Let's hide.
Here I come, ready or not!
Aaa-ooo!
Where is everybody?
Everybody hidden?
Aaa-ooo!
Here I come!
Oh, I'm looking.
I'm looking, but I'm not seeing.
Oh, my goodness.
You're such good hiders.
Oh, Rag Doll, Rag Doll, I see you behind the chair.
Oh, and all the rest of you.
Oh, my goodness.
All right, all right.
And last one to tag the base is it.
Let's go!
I'm gonna get you.
Ha-ha!
Ooh, I'm gonna catch you, you cute little furry things.
Here I come.
Serena.
Serena.
All right.
Everyone back where they belong.
There are some dolls missing, Auntie Serena.
Serena!
Well, don't worry, sweetheart.
We'll find them later.
You bellowed, O Square One?
Serena, our guests will be here in less than an hour.
How's dinner coming?
Wow-ee.
What a worrywart.
I'm going to zap up the exact dinner I once cooked for Henry VIII.
Never mind, Serena.
Just something, uh, simple.
How about peanut butter, straight, no jelly?
Is that simple enough?
How about salad, roast beef, string beans and baked potato?
Believe me, it was more fun cooking for Henry VIII than it is for Ding-Dong I. Serena, I'm going upstairs now and get ready, and I'd appreciate it if you'd get with the dinner.
Haven't you forgotten something?
What?
Don't you give your sweet little wife a kissy-poo when you come home from work?
Forget it, Serena.
Look, dumb-dumb, I am not a live-in maid.
I am a wife, and I want a kiss.
I've had more passionate kisses from my mother.
Uh, look, Serena, uh, when the client and his wife get here, eh, promise you'll behave.
I promise I'll behave.
Witch's honour.
And you'll be nice to the client and his wife.
And I'll be nice to the client.
I don't know about his wife.
Just be nice.
Dumb-dumb, I promised you I'd be nice, and nice is what you're going to get.
Oh, Darrin.
Please come in.
Mrs. Berkley.
How are you doing, Mrs. Berkley?
Good evening, Stephens.
Mr. Berkley.
Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Berkley, this is my wife, Samantha.
How do you?
Oh.
Uh, how do you do, Mrs?
Berkley.
Berkley.
How do you?
My.
Darrin certainly didn't exaggerate, did he?
I didn't?
Am I supposed to ask what this is all about?
Oh, I couldn't tell you.
It would just embarrass you.
If you're going to pay him a compliment, don't hesitate.
He can use it.
My biggest fan.
Well, speaking of compliments, anyone care for a complimentary drink?
Anything.
Double.
Heh.
Darrin.
Well, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.
Well, thank you.
You too.
Well, come right in and sit down and make yourself comfy.
There you go.
You're not gonna keep us in suspense.
What did your husband tell you about Roland?
You want me to tell you?
What's the matter with Sam?
Only if you want to.
Nothing.
Why?
I want to.
Since when does Samantha greet the client with a kiss?
Mrs. Stephens, you're a very affectionate person, aren't you?
Well, what's wrong with that, Martha?
You're right, Mrs. Berkley.
I am a very affectionate person.
I just love people.
Don't you think people should love people?
Listen to her, Martha.
It wouldn't hurt.
I've become terribly interested in the, uh, new trend of developing the senses.
Particularly touch.
Now Now, tell me, Roland.
Yes.
Do you feel something?
Yours is a martini, Mrs. Berkley, right?
Oh, yes.
Mr. Berkley.
Yeah, yeah.
Oh, yes.
Now, Martha, let's try.
Feel the warmth?
No, it's cold and wet.
I have always felt that That people should be nice.
Don't you think so, Roland?
Yes.
Yes Yes, I do.
Something else for you to remember, Martha.
I have a feeling I'm not going to forget anything about tonight.
This new kick that Sam's on, heh, I think she's overdoing it.
She's not herself tonight.
Well, why don't we come back when she's recovered?
Oh, nonsense, Martha.
The world is an uptight place.
People don't express enough warmth.
I think we should let ourselves go.
Well, I'm for that.
Let's go.
Oh, heavens, Mrs. Berkley.
Don't tell me you misunderstood what I meant by "affection".
Ha-ha!
Yes, Mrs. Berkley.
I mean, I hope you didn't misunderstand what Samantha meant by "affection".
What did you mean?
Sam, why don't you let me help you in the kitchen?
I think something's burning.
I think it's Martha.
Hee-hee!
Come on, Sam.
The kitchen.
Um, how about a little kiss for the cook?
I refuse to serve dinner until I get a kiss.
Well, I guess we're all pretty hungry, aren't we?
Darrin, you kiss her.
Come on, Sam.
The kitchen.
Serena, if you were a mortal, I'd wring your neck.
Easy.
Don't aggravate my witchcraft.
Do you know what you did in there?
You took a man who represents a $500,000 account and obviously played up to him.
You asked me to promise to be nice.
I was, and he seemed to enjoy it.
But his wife seemed to hate it.
Goody.
Hi, sweetheart.
The winds of adversity got through to me on the atmospheric continuum.
I got back as soon as I could.
All right, cousin.
What are you up to?
Oh, cousin, there is no satisfying this mortal oaf you're married to.
He asked me to be nice to the client.
I was merely being nice to the client.
And my feelings are hurt and I'm leaving.
What's going on?
Your beloved cousin has been flirting with the client and driving his wife up the wall.
What are you two trying to do, sabotage the account?
Mr. and Mrs. Berkley are at each other's throats in there.
Well, at least they're still in there.
Yeah, but not for long.
I mean it, Roland.
I want you to take me home now.
Well, not before dinner, for heaven's sakes.
That That would, eh, hurt her feelings.
Roland.
Wait a minute.
I believe that you're actually jealous.
Jealous?
Of what?
Of you and her?
What are you doing?
That's it, isn't it?
Tell the truth.
You're a little jealous, aren't you?
I'm not a little jealous.
Oh.
I'm a lot jealous.
Oh, Martha.
Martha, that's the nicest thing you've said to me in years.
Do?
Do you feel something?
Yes.
Okay, now we can go home.
Ooh.
Mr. and Mrs. Berkley, I am terribly embarrassed.
Mr. Tate just told me that you misunderstood my intentions.
I'm the one who's embarrassed.
I'm afraid I overreacted.
But you did react.
And that's the whole point of sensitivity awareness.
You're doing very nicely, Mrs. Berkley.
I am?
Oh, thank you.
I try.
Oh, you certainly do, Mrs. Berkley.
Heh-heh!
Now, let me hold your hand again.
You feel something?
No, but I think I saw something.
Oh, that's no What is that thing?
What is it?
Does it bite?
It's Harry.
Yes, it certainly is.
Oh.
I I No, not Not hairy.
Harry.
Oh, Harry!
Oh, Stephens, wait a minute.
I think I know what you're up to.
Is it okay if I, uh, guess?
It looks like you're ahead of me, so guess away.
Yes.
Now, you were, uh, talking earlier about a campaign aimed at the young folks.
The, uh, longhairs, so to speak.
Harry is part of that campaign.
Right?
Fantastic guess.
Ha-ha-ha!
Huh, Sam?
Huh?
Oh!
Phenomenal.
Mr. Berkley, under all that hair is a boy actor who will be playing the "before" part in the Berkley Hair Tonic campaign.
I thought so.
Ha-ha-ha!
He's cute.
Yes.
Does?
Does he have fleas?
Oh, so sweet.
Harry.
Give me a kiss.
Sensitive, is he?
Very sensitive.
Harry, Harry.
Come on, Harry.
You forget how much you shed.
Come on, Stephens.
Tell me, how do you plan to use, uh, Harry?
Oh, well, Mr. Berkley, uh, we We don't want the young people to think that Berkley Hair Tonic I-is against, uh, long hair.
No.
And we want to establish that, in fact, you're all for it.
Right.
And we also wanna establish that the young people don't have to carry it to this extreme.
Yeah.
How are you going to, uh, illustrate the, eh, better-groomed look?
Here's how it goes.
"Why look like this?
"With Berkley Hair Tonic and a trip to the barber, you can look like a prince".
I think you've got something.
The boy never misses.
Brilliant, Darrin.
It was nothing.
Just another one of Darrin's hare-brained ideas.
Oh, Stephens, tell this young man to take off his fur coat.
I wanna shake his hand.
He can't do that.
Why not?
Because he He's a Method actor.
He lives his part.
Well, it's past his bedtime, so I'll just take him on upstairs.
Sweetheart, you fix the folks another drink, okay?
Great idea.
Let's drink to my signing with McMann & Tate.
I'll drink to that.
Oh, darling, I can hardly wait to get back to our sensitive awareness.
Now.
Sam, I'd like to tell you that I love you, but somehow it doesn't seem like enough.
It's enough.
I'm not greedy.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
More coffee, sweetheart?
No, thanks.
I'll just finish this and get going.
Sam, how come you haven't said a word about my tie?
I was looking for just the right word.
You don't like it.
I didn't say that.
You do like it?
I didn't say that either.
Well, I like it.
You gotta keep up with the times, you know.
Oh, did you finish the jingle for Colonel Bringham's Succulent Spareribs?
Yeah.
I got two pretty good ones here, if I say so myself.
I just can't make up my mind.
What mind?
Well, well, well.
If it isn't the author of: How to Be a Shrewish Mother-In-Law.
Darrin.
This is a perfect illustration of why Durwood remains on his treadmill.
A man who can't make up his mind never will succeed.
Endora, that criticism is unfair, unworthy and-- Uninvited.
And to show you how wrong you are, I have just made up my mind to take my leave.
What this house needs is a keeper.
Mother.
Oh, Mother.
You are so exasperatingly unfair to Darrin.
And once, just once, when you come to visit, I wish you'd leave your fangs at home.
I'll have Adam dressed in a minute.
You can play with him, okay?
I'd be delighted.
When, oh, when will you ever learn that mother knows best?
And what mother knows best is how to prove she's right.
Indecision now Will be your fate In matters small And matters great A plague of ifs And ands and buts Will now descend And drive you nuts Hi, dumbo.
Are you out of your tree?
What are you doing there?
Get off.
Unless you'd rather stay.
On second thought, get off.
Personally, I think I make a rather dashing hood ornament.
But how would you know?
Oh, Mr. Stephens!
Mr. Stephens!
I have something to discuss with you.
Can you spare a minute?
Of course.
But not really.
Well, which?
Well, actually, I should be getting to the office, but on the other hand What is it you want to tell me, Mrs. Kravitz?
Well, it's about the trash cans in the neighborhood.
Have you noticed how terrible they look on trash day?
I'm trying to get everybody to replace or paint them.
Hey-- Wow, look at the time.
I've got to rush.
Oh-oh, but-- But I still don't know whether you're for or against it.
Can't you just spare another minute?
Of course.
Take your time.
I'm in no hurry whatsoever.
You know, Mr. Stephens, someday your sarcasm is gonna get you in trouble.
Mother?
Mother?
Hm.
Oh, dear.
Sweetheart, will you take him outside on the patio and play Okay.
while I answer this?
Scoot.
Come on, Adam.
I'll show you how to skip rope.
Oh, hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Well, what can I do for you?
Ask not what you can do for me.
Ask what you can do for your neighborhood.
Okay.
What can I do for my neighborhood?
It's about cleaning up the trash cans in the neighborhood.
Well, that's a good idea.
Well, I discussed this with your husband as he was leaving, but I just couldn't get anywhere with him.
Didn't Darrin agree?
Well, I-- I really couldn't tell.
He acted so strange, like he was-- Uh, I don't know, in a daze, the way he kept changing his mind and-- Changing his mind?
Maybe he ought to see a doctor or something.
"Or something" is probably a better suggestion.
Uh, Mrs. Kravitz, will you excuse me?
I have an urgent matter I have to take care of.
Well, what if we paint the trash cans the same color?
Well, that's fine with me.
Well, would you prefer yellow or--?
Mother, I-I'm not accusing.
I-I'm just asking.
Did you put a hex on Darrin this morning?
Ooh!
"Hex, no".
Mother, that pun is not only sick, it is beyond help.
Tabitha, behave yourself.
Come on, Adam.
Give me back my jump rope.
Adam, will--?
Will you give Tabitha back her jump rope?
Oh, Mother, I'll-- I'll take care of you later.
Darrin, I love these jingles you did for Colonel Bringham's Spareribs.
Which one do you think we ought to pitch?
Well, the one I really like is the "Pop Goes the Weasel".
But the other is very effective too, because-- I-I really can't make up my mind.
Colonel Bringham's going to be here in half an hour, so let's come to a decision.
Of-- Of course, till we actually meet him, we'll have to do some blind flying, but personally, I like "The Little Piggy Goes to Market".
It's appropriate for the product and it's nice and safe.
Don't you agree?
Absolutely.
Good.
But not necessarily.
What?
Well, I mean, I think it's a good approach, but on the other hand, is it?
What do you mean?
Maybe it's a bad approach.
Darrin, don't fall apart just when we're about to close in on this account.
You know, your trouble is you worry too much.
New tie, huh?
Right.
It's a little overboard, isn't it?
It's okay with me.
Yes, but is it appropriate to wear when you're about to meet a conservative gentleman of the old South?
A thing like this can be very damaging.
He might not say anything, but he'll make a mental note: "This man is not to be trusted".
Because of your tie?
That's ridiculous.
You're right.
That's ridiculous.
Excuse me.
Where are you going?
Out to buy another tie.
Oh, hi-- Hi, Betty.
May I speak to him, please?
Oh, hi, Miss Stephens.
He went out to buy a tie.
He did?
Well, that's funny.
He was wearing a brand-new tie when he left.
Yeah, I know.
I don't know what got into him.
I'm afraid I do.
Pardon?
Oh, uh, no-- Nothing.
Uh, maybe I'll just come upstairs and wait for him.
Oh, are you in the building?
Uh, no.
But I'm not far away.
Thanks, Betty.
Bye-bye.
Aunt Hagatha?
Aunt Hagatha?
Samantha.
Oh, I wish you wouldn't do that.
I was getting 40 winks and I was only up to 35.
Oh, well, I-I'm terribly sorry, Aunt Hagatha, but it's an emergency.
Mother's been interfering again, so she's hiding out.
Now, I have to pop down to Darrin's office and check on something.
Adam's taking his nap.
Tabitha's playing in her room.
And I owe you five winks.
Ooh   Good afternoon.
This account man of yours better be pretty good.
I'm not used to waiting around for people that work for me.
Neither am I. I can't get over the fact that you are not from the South.
I wish you'd try and get over it.
Everybody makes the same mistake.
Frankly, it doesn't amuse me.
I suppose it's the combination of "colonel" and "spareribs".
All those Kentucky colonels, you know.
I'm a colonel.
U.S. Army, retired.
Oh?
I find that fascinating.
I find it a bore.
So is waiting around for this genius of yours.
I'm sure something must have happened to him.
And for his sake, I hope so.
I don't really understand it.
It's not like Darrin to be late for a meeting.
Yeah, I know.
The colonel's here and Mr. Tate is livid.
Sam, what are you doing here?
Sweetheart, I have to talk to you about something.
Mr. Stephens, the colonel is here and Mr. Tate is pretty upset.
Oh, has he been asking for me?
Not asking.
Yelling.
You're to get your material and go right in.
Okay.
Come on, Sam.
Is something wrong?
Yes, with you.
I think Mother might have-- I thought you went shopping for a new tie.
I did.
But the salesman confused me by showing me every tie he had, so I finally gave up.
What was wrong with the one you were wearing?
I thought it might be a little too daring for a conservative man like the colonel.
That doesn't make any sense.
Oh, yes, it does.
But not too much.
But on the other hand, you can't overlook anything when you're dealing with a client, no matter how foolish it seems.
And it seems this was pretty foolish, so why did I do it?
Oh Oh-- Oh, Darrin, I was right.
You are not well.
Darrin, would you please get your--?
Oh, hi, Sam.
Would you care to join us?
No.
What?
I mean, yes.
And no.
What-- What he means is we we're in the middle of a discussion.
So were the colonel and I, and it was about whether you're going to be working here tomorrow.
Excuse us.
All right, Mother.
I have had it with your interference.
If the New York Jets had it, they could probably win the championship.
"Enjoyed your pun.
"I'm trifling with the maharajah of Janipur and haven't time to trifle with you".
Oh "P.S. Notify the Jets I won't be available until 5:00 this afternoon".
Ah!
Good grief, Mother, you're driving me crazy.
South Philadelphia?
It seems everyone makes the same mistake, Darrin, so let's not bore the colonel.
Just go on.
Uh, right.
Uh, this is the layout for the campaign.
And the jingle is based on "Pop Goes the Weasel".
Now, naturally, I'm not a singer, but I'll do my best.
Uh, not that I can't sing.
I can.
But not very well.
Darrin, get on with it.
For succulent ribs That beat the best You've got to try Colonel Bringham They're best by taste And best by test Oh, how you'll dig 'em So stop by the colonel's For a bucket of ribs Give a day off to mommy You'll love them And we never tell fibs "Yum," goes your tummy "'Yum,' goes your tummy"?
Of course, that line can be changed.
Or any of the lines.
Or even the melody.
No.
Why?
It's catchy.
Exactly.
Darrin, don't change a thing.
Naturally, with an orchestra, it'll be even more effective.
Right, Darrin?
Right.
At least I hope so.
You, uh, seem to have some reservations.
No, no, no.
I was just thinking about the other idea I had.
In some ways, it was even cuter.
It's based on, uh, "This Little Piggy Went to Market".
The game you play with a baby's toes.
Hm.
Toes, spareribs?
Bad image, forget it.
Would you let him go on?
Do you really like this idea?
How do I know?
I haven't heard it yet.
Well, now, Larry's right.
Uh, I think we should go with, "'Yum,' goes your tummy".
I don't.
But I thought you said you liked it.
I did, but if he's got any doubts about it, that's enough to kill it for me.
Well, then let me finish telling you about "This Little Piggy Goes to Market".
No, no, no.
I'm sorry.
I can't wait around here When you make up your mind what you're sold on, then you can sell me.
Colonel, would you wait just a moment, please?
I want to make arrangements to pick you up for dinner tonight.
Be right back.
Congratulations.
That was one of the most beautiful pieces of sabotage I've ever witnessed.
Oh, yeah?
Well, let me tell you something-- I really made a mess of it, didn't I?
Darrin, you're not well.
Uh, Larry, if you don't mind, I'd better go right home.
Mind?
That's the best idea you've had today.
Or should I stay?
Let me help you.
Go home.
That's an order.
Uh, yes, sir.
On the other hand-- Darrin, I'll try to talk the colonel into coming over a little earlier tonight.
So you better come up with something to replace the idea you just shot down.
I'll do my best.
I just saw your best.
You'll have to do better.
Sam.
I had a feeling you'd be home early.
I would have been home a lot earlier, but I couldn't decide whether to take the tunnel or the bridge.
And I finally decided on the bridge, then I couldn't decide which bridge.
I've been driving around for hours.
On top of everything else, Larry is bringing the client over early.
Sam, do something!
I-I've been trying to reach Mother all afternoon.
Now, please, just calm down.
I'm calm, I'm calm.
For a man who's upset, I am very calm.
I'm also very upset.
Mother.
Mother?
I-- I-- I'm gonna count to three and I want you to show up at once, or else.
One, two, three.
Four?
Five.
Or else what?
Mother, I want you to take that spell off Darrin and don't deny that you put one on him.
Who's denying?
Endora, no offense, but the more I see you, the more I like you less.
But on the other hand, you do have a warm spot for me.
Right?
That's true.
And I wish you'd go there right now.
I'd be delighted.
Mother, don've until you have taken that spell off Darrin.
Samantha, are you ordering me?
No.
I'm just suggesting very strongly.
Very well.
I guess I've had my fun.
Spell's off.
There you are.
No harm done.
No harm done?
How would you like a necklace of fingers?
Oh, careful, sweetheart.
Don't stop him, Samantha.
When he's angry and his eyes flash like that, it transforms him from a dull clod into an angry dull clod.
Same to you, fella.
What was that?
Mother, what do you expect him to do, lie down like a lamb?
Especially when you're so wrong about him.
He is not indecisive.
He has no trouble making up his mind.
And when he does, he rarely changes it.
You mean he's pigheaded.
I didn't say that.
Well, I did.
Oh!
Oh-- Oh, Mother, that's-- That's-- A definite improvement.
Uh, you're right, sweetheart.
That is absolutely the lowest thing Mother has ever done.
No, it isn't.
This is.
Where is he?
Outside, where the entire world can see how pigheaded he is.
Outside?
You didn't do anything outrageous like put him on the front lawn?
What kind of a fool do you take me for?
I put him on the roof.
Oh, my stars.
Ooh!
Darrin, don't you call my mother names like that.
It might make matters worse.
That's true.
How could they be?
I'll get you down in a moment, sweetheart.
Oh, my stars.
Stephens is one of those erratic geniuses.
They're peculiar, but the end product is-- What's the matter?
Hi, Larry.
Sam, what's--?
What's that?
It's Darrin.
Uh, you must be Colonel Bringham.
Uh, how do you do?
I-- I'm Samantha Stephens.
You are?
I mean, how do you do?
I-I suppose you're wondering what that is all about.
Wondering isn't quite the word.
Well, it's Darrin's idea for a revolving sign to go over all your restaurants, colonel.
All-- All right, sweetheart.
Revolve.
Well, uh, actually, that-- That is just part of the whole campaign that Darrin has devised for you, colonel.
Uh, the pig's head will be seen on all of your TV commercials, uh, your menus, et cetera.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.
Uh, that's enough, sweetheart.
I think they've got the idea.
You can come down now.
Shall we go inside?
By the way, how'd he get up there?
Oh, uh by that ladder.
Oh?
That's funny.
I didn't notice the ladder until now.
Darrin, come on down.
We're anxious to hear the details.
How's that for enterprise, huh?
McMann & Tate is first in enterprise.
Yeah, well, I'll be the judge of that.
What's your new idea, Stephens?
Uh, well, it-it-- It's very difficult to talk in that mask, So instead of talking, uh, why don't we just go inside and demonstrate to, uh, Larry and the colonel?
Good idea.
Come.
We'll have a drink too.
How did you get your wife to collaborate with you like this?
I can't get my wife interested in spareribs.
Oh, ha-ha, you'd be surprised how many ideas have been born in this house.
Uh, now-- Now, sweetheart, um, do you remember where you come in?
Oh, good.
Good.
Colonel Bringham's Ribs are best Ee-eye-ee-eye-oh They're sweet and tender That's no jest Ee-eye-ee-eye-oh With a:  Here and a:  There.
Here a:  There a: Everywhere a:  Buy a bucket of ribs today Ee-eye-ee-eye-oh I've just got one word for that.
Look, they were just kidding around.
Weren't you?
I hope not.
I think it's sensational.
Oh, listen, these two never kid around.
Ah, you've done it again, you sly fox.
Or should I say, "sly pig"?
You're pretty good at that.
You ought to perform in the commercial yourself.
What do you think?
Uh, why--?
Why don't you take that thing off now?
Oh, well-- Well, uh, Larry, you know how Darrin loves to investigate details.
Well, he just wanted to see how long an actor could stay in that mask without too much discomfort.
Oh.
Tremendous head for detail.
Hm.
But we're going to be eating soon, so why don't you take it off?
Yes, and how long are you going to--?
Oh.
Uh, if-- If you'll excuse us, we have a special fluid in the kitchen that we remove it with.
We'll be right back.
Mm.
I am very impressed with him, Tate.
He really takes his work seriously.
Well, that's the sort of thing I encourage at McMann & Tate.
Okay, Mother, this is it.
The chips are down.
Either you show up or-- Either I show up or what?
Either you show up or you don't.
Mother, we have guests.
Why don't you tell them Durwood made a pig of himself?
M-Mother, undo your thing, and quickly.
I don't know.
I think I'm entitled to a little apology first.
Apologize, sweetheart.
He apologizes.
I didn't quite catch that.
Sam?
Mother!
Oh, you didn't tell me your mother was here, Samantha.
How are you, Endora?
Very well, thank you.
Well, uh, M-Mother just dropped in unexpectedly.
And now she has to drop out.
Oh, too bad.
Anyway, thanks to your brilliant footwork, Darrin, the account is ours.
Well, there was nothing wrong with Sam's footwork either.
Or her singing.
Thanks, Sam.
I don't suppose I get any thanks at all.
Oh, Mother.
You'll get yours, later.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
Marital Unrest?
Why'd you buy a book about that?
I didn't.
Louise Tate insisted upon lending it to me.
Why?
She says it tells what you and I are in for.
It's about boredom in marriage.
Sam, in our marriage, boredom will never be a problem.
Hm.
Thank you.
I'll pretend that was a compliment.
Louise insisted I read the first chapter, which I just did.
The author says after several years of marriage, it's common for husbands and wives to feel they'd rather be married to somebody else.
What does he recommend, therapeutic divorce?
Not in Chapter 1.
He merely describes the problem.
Well, is that how you feel?
Of course not.
Good.
That's not how I feel either.
So let's go to sleep.
Okay.
Mwah.
Darrin, I'm really concerned about Louise.
I mean, she wouldn't have insisted I read Sam.
Well    Okay, sleepyhead, time to get up.
Larry?
What are you doing here?
I live here.
Me your husband, Larry.
You my wife, Louise.
Remember?
I know you Larry, but But me, Louise?
What's the matter, Louise?
Were you having a bad dream?
No.
But I think I'm having one now.
Louise, I warned you.
In the future, no more apricot brandy before bedtime.
What?
Louise, if it isn't asking too much, I'd like my breakfast.
I'm sorry, Larry, but there seems to be a short circuit in somebody's witchcraft.
Well, I still look like Samantha.
And I still sound like Samantha.
But Larry thinks I'm Louise.
So the next question is, where is Louise?
The question after that is, does Darrin know I'm gone?
Well, I'd better check on that.
Sam?
Yes, Darrin?
How about some breakfast?
Oh, okay.
Darrin, for some reason, my bathrobe and slippers seem tight on me.
Well, maybe you gained some weight.
In my feet?
I don't know.
You look the same to me.
Honey, get moving, huh?
Oh.
Come on.
I'm gonna be late for work.
Okay.
Mother.
Mother.
Yes, my child?
You recognize me.
Well, is that unusual?
I've known you hundreds Mother, uh, never mind.
Something very weird has happened.
Oh?
Yes.
Larry Tate thinks I'm his wife, Louise.
And Darrin and Louise think Louise is me.
La-la-la.
Sounds exciting.
Well, now, I I I look and talk exactly like me and Louise looks and talks exactly like her, but not to them.
Is that clear to you?
Perfectly.
Good.
Then explain it to me.
It must be a form of transfiguration.
Huh?
It's a metaphysical molecular disturbance that's put in force by a witch.
Now, you and I are immune to it because we are witches.
But as dreary mortals, Durwood and the Tates are not.
I remember when you were a child, there was a similar mix-up in which you couldn't tell the difference between your father and a rhinoceros.
Mother, this is no time for family anecdotes.
I have Larry frozen in his bedroom.
Maybe I should put everybody in the freezer until I can figure this out.
The entire mortal world?
No, I guess that wouldn't work.
Dr. Bombay.
Oh, Mother, please.
Oh Oh, find him and send him to me as soon as you can.
Well, yes, dear, I'll try.
But don't be too upset.
Why not?
Well, keep an open mind.
Give Larry Tate a chance.
He may be a better husband for you.
After all, he can't be any worse.
Mother, did anyone ever tell you you have a fantastic sense of humor?
Oh, frequently.
Well, they were wrong.
Louise, what was I saying?
I I seem to have lost my train of thought.
You're dressed.
Yes, do you like it?
But a second ago, you were in your nightgown.
Weren't you?
Larry, I think maybe you should lay off those after-dinner stingers.
Oh, Jon, you haven't finished your milk.
You're staring at me.
Why?
I don't know.
Okay, Jon, let's go.
Are you taking him to the office with you?
I'm dropping him at school like I always do.
What made you think I was taking him to the office?
Uh, well, it was just a joke.
He's so big and strong, I thought he was ready to go to work.
Uh-huh.
I'll go get my books.
Mm.
Uh, h-have Have a nice day.
You too.
A handshake?
Since when does a wife send her husband into the rat race with a handshake?
Mwah.
That's better.
That's the kind of passion I'm accustomed to.
Ooh!
I wonder what's new with Darrin and Louise.
Have good day, sweetheart.
You too.
Mwah.
See you later.
Mother.
Mother?
Samantha, I found him.
Dr. Bombay, is that you?
Of course.
Endora caught me clowning around with my nurse.
Clowning around.
Did you tell him what the problem is?
Yes.
I said it's a clear-cut case of metaphysical molecular disturbance.
But I don't take the diagnosis of a laywitch.
Samantha, over here.
Stand on your left foot.
Place your right pinkie on your nose.
Take your right foot in your left hand.
Now repeat after me: Willy Warlock walked away with Wally Walrus.
Willy Warlock walked away with Wally Walrus.
Again.
Will Willy Warlock walked away with Wally Walrus.
Thank you.
That's my favorite tongue twister.
Nothing.
Endora, good guess.
Metaphysical molecular Unquestionably.
Naturally, she doesn't have it.
She's a cosmic carrier.
It's one of those fortunate ailments that only affects mortals that have contact with witches.
Can you cure them?
You're the one who's sick.
They were innocent bystanders hit by a stray shot of witchcraft.
Our only hope is to treat you, thereby curing them.
Not before you get rid of that ridiculous costume.
Hm, it is a little unprofessional, isn't it?
Do you play the harmonica?
No, but But I'm I'm a fast learner.
Good.
Play eight bars of "Pop Goes the Cosmos" out of tune.
That will force your molecules back in tune.
It's a special harmonica coated with a combination of medically tested ingredients.
That should do it.
Well, I'll I'll go visit Louise and see if it worked.
Hi, there.
Oh, Louise.
What a pleasant surprise.
Uh-oh.
No dice.
I beg your pardon?
I I said, so nice.
So nice to see you too.
Well, come on in.
I'd love to.
Believe me, I would love to, but, uh, I have to go.
You You just got here.
Well, I I shouldn't have come over without calling, so So I I don't want to intrude.
Bye-bye, Samantha.
Bye, Louise.
It didn't work.
I know, I just tried.
Huh?
No, I I mean Louise still thinks I'm her and she's me.
Hm?
Hm!
Those molecules must be more disturbed than I anticipated.
That's one on you, isn't it?
I'll have to concoct a potion.
Doctor, concoct quickly.
I can't, the key ingredient is the marrow from the tooth of a saber-toothed tiger.
I shall have to go to Asia Minor for it.
I'm no longer on speaking terms with Asia Senior.
No longer  I need a tiger tamer, tiger tamer.
My nurse.
She really has charms to soothe the savage beast.
Soothe the savage Oh.
Hm.
Hello, Betty.
Hello, Mrs. Tate.
Would you like to see Mr. Tate?
Uh, no, I I'd like to see Mr. Stephens.
I'm planning a surprise party.
Yes?
Mr. Stephens?
Mrs. Tate would like to see you.
Oh?
Send her in.
Go right in.
Thank you.
Louise.
How nice to see you.
Louise, what are you doing?
I'm trying to convey something.
Well, you succeeded.
But since you're married to my friend and business associate, I'll ignore it.
Now, uh, what else can I do for you?
Uh, let's sit down, Darrin.
I have some important news for you.
Darrin, I know that your wife is a witch.
You know what?
Samantha Stephens is a witch.
Oh, come on, Louise, that's ridiculous.
Uh, there are no such things as witches.
Sweetheart, I I know this is hard for you, but the reason I know Samantha is a witch is because I am Samantha.
I I may look like Louise to you but that's because I caused something called a metaphysical molecular disturbance.
Well, Louise, you certainly have a vivid imagination.
Okay.
Um, see if this gesture rings a bell with you.
It's It's impossible.
Would you like them to play "Melancholy Baby"?
Sam, it is you.
What happened?
It's not my fault.
And Dr. Bombay is working on a potion to bring everything back to normal.
So, uh, don't be furious.
Just mildly annoyed.
Mildly annoyed?
Okay, very annoyed.
Well, if I thought you were Louise, what do Louise and Larry think?
They think I'm Louise too, and they think Louise is me.
So while we're waiting for Dr. Bombay, all we have to do is Is what?
Is not let the Tates find out.
And the best way to do that is go along with the gag.
Some gag.
We'll invite them to our house for dinner.
Sort of a surprise party for Larry.
And if Dr. Bombay has come up with a potion by then, fine, we'll have a perfectly nice evening.
If not, we'll stay up all night talking.
Darrin Louise, what are you doing here?
Uh, well Well, what a shame, Louise.
He spoiled it.
Spoiled what?
Your surprise party at Darrin and Samantha's tonight.
My surprise party?
What's the occasion?
There is no occasion.
That's what makes it a surprise.
Uh, now, uh, what is it you wanted to see me about?
Oh.
I forgot.
Hi, Darrin.
Hi, Larry.
Hi, Louise.
Darrin.
Surprise.
Oh, hi, Sam.
Larry.
Well, uh, come on in.
Hm.
Uh, Louise, would you mind giving me help in the kitchen?
A pleasure.
I'll get you a drink.
Okay.
Martini, extra dry.
Louise, you hate martinis.
Oh Oh, yes.
Well, that's just another one of tonight's surprises.
She gets mean when she drinks martinis.
Samantha?
Hm?
How are Tabitha and Adam?
Oh, they're fine.
They're asleep.
Oh, Louise, thank goodness you're here.
I really could use some help getting dinner ready.
I don't know why, but I just can't seem to get organized.
It's been like that all day.
That happens to me sometimes.
In your own kitchen?
Mm-hm.
I'll make the salad.
Thanks, Louise.
I'll set the table.
Mother?
Mother?
Yes, my darling?
Have you heard from Dr. Bombay?
Not a word.
Oh.
Maybe all the saber-toothed tigers are in hibernation.
Maybe he is too, with his nurse.
Shall I still look for him?
Yes, please.
I have a feeling this is going to be an interesting, long, dull, interesting party.
There.
That does it.
That's it.
Four spades.
Game and rubber.
Let's play another.
Yeah, let's.
It's 11:30.
Oh, the night's young.
Louise, I'm all bridged out.
How many rubbers have we played?
Eight.
Each team won four.
Well, let's go for the championship.
Whoever wins, uh, six rubbers first.
That's a marvelous idea.
Louise, Samantha said she had enough.
Darrin, you and I have to go to work tomorrow.
Good night, Sam, and thanks for a lovely Wait.
Uh, Larry, you can't eat and play bridge and run.
It's your surprise party.
It wouldn't be polite to Darrin and Sam.
Louise, the polite thing is to leave at a decent hour.
Right, Sam?
Well, it is getting pretty late.
Oh, I I I have another idea.
Uh, let's play a word game.
Now, s-see See if you know the answer to this.
What's black and white and red all over?
A newspaper.
Wrong.
Samantha, do you know the answer?
No.
Uh, try me, Louise.
What's black and white and red all over?
Uh, an American flag with a lot of mistakes.
Ha.
Wrong.
Oh, okay.
What is black and white and red all over?
A zebra with a sunburn.
That's very clever, Louise.
But if you don't mind, I'm tired.
Let's go home and go to bed.
Um, Samantha, is there any more coffee?
Yes, but it's cold.
Marvelous, I'll have some ice coffee.
I'll I'll get it.
I don't know what's gotten into Louise.
She's been acting strange all day long.
Mother?
Yes, darling?
Toughest safari I've ever been on.
My nurse doubled as supply bearer, but she said my behavior was unbearable.
Shh!
Unbearable Is that the potion?
Yes, it is.
Marrow of tooth of saber-toothed tiger eye of newt, toe of frog, wool of bat, and dietetic cola.
Sounds rather bland, but perhaps it'll work.
It has to.
We're running out of conversation.
Mm.
Ooh, that's terrific.
Sam, I know you and Darrin are tired.
And I apologize for Louise's behavior, but I've learned through the years it's better not to fight it.
Larry, don't be silly.
The evening's young.
Well, the evening may be young, but I'm not.
So if you don't mind.
But it didn't work.
Metaphysical molecules remain disturbed.
Me too.
Well, I I don't understand.
I Samantha, was there something about last night you didn't tell me?
I don't think so.
Unless Unless what?
I seem to recall having a dream.
A dream?
Re-create it for me.
I can't.
You must.
I'll try.
Uh Uh, let's Let's see.
I was tossing and turning and tossing and turning.
And it was very breezy.
And I kept hearing over and over again: Louise, Louise, Louise.
Well, that's about it.
I see.
Every little breeze seemed to whisper, Louise.
Oh, for Pete's sake.
Anyway, when I woke up, I was in the Tates' bedroom.
Naturally.
Transcendental transplant?
Dream inversion.
The molecules were not only disturbed, they were held there by a layer of dream inversion.
Similar to smog, only healthier.
Is it any easier to get rid of?
Oh, infinitely.
The potion will work with a booster shot of an incantation.
Molecules return To your former states.
Mates return To your former mates.
And let Larry and Louise In mortal density.
Remember not Their mistaken "idensity".
Sorry about that.
It worked.
Oh, it worked.
Thank you, Dr. Bombay.
You too, Mother.
Yes, dear.
Care to, uh, come up to my pad for a nightcap?
Forget it, sawbones.
Oh, well.
Back to my nurse.
Larry.
Larry, wake up.
Louise, why are you shaking me?
Because it's time to go home.
I mean, if you're going to sleep, home's where you ought to do it.
Ah.
Good night, Samantha, Darrin.
And thanks for a fun evening.
You have no idea.
Huh?
Good night, Louise.
Thanks for dinner, Sam.
It was our pleasure.
We'll let ourselves out.
Louise, come on.
You drive.
Night-night.
Night.
Night.
Sam, where are you going?
Where do you think?
Upstairs to see Adam and Tabitha and reclaim them.
Mm-mm.
Not before you reclaim me.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Ah, it's time to round up the kids and go shopping.
You sure you don't want to come with us?
I'm sure I do want to come with you, but I promised Larry I'd spend part of this weekend trying to come up with a campaign for the Cushman Cosmetic account.
Okay, sweetheart.
We'll be home early.
Well, if it isn't the odd couple, as I live and breathe.
Serena, those are your two worst habits.
Oh, Sammy, you married beneath you.
What's that?
It's a present for tall, dark and dull.
It's a peace offering.
A peace offering?
Yes.
When the planet Icarus passes between Venus and Jupiter, it stills the winds of adversity within me, and I become a veritable sea of tranquility.
Huh?
I've decided to bury the hatchet.
Yeah?
Where?
Have you ever thought of giving lessons in graciousness?
Darrin, Serena wants to make peace, so don't fight it.
Okay.
Thank you, Serena.
Oh.
Oh, Sammy, this really does make me feel good.
I mean, after all, if you have to be saddled with a mortal, he's as good as any.
Thanks a lot.
Wow.
A portable television set.
That's very nice of you, Serena.
Oh, that's okay.
Turn it on.
Where do I plug it in?
Just turn it on, ding-a-ling.
Try Channel 13.
Thirteen?
Yeah.
That's the weather report.
The weather tomorrow will be heavy snow all along the eastern seaboard.
That's ridiculous.
There's not a cloud in the sky, and it's 75 degrees outside.
Don't argue with him.
That's the only weather report you can really count on.
Oh?
Because he is the weather man.
Uh-oh.
Sam, would you kindly tell your cousin that I don't want anything that she's conjured up out of bats' wings and eels' eyes.
Bats' wings?
Eels' eyes?
Sammy, how would you like to be married to a 170-pound artichoke?
Serena, please.
Okay, Sammy.
Okay.
Satisfied?
Thank you.
Now, Sam, would you ask her to leave before I say something I won't regret?
I think I better leave before I do something I won't regret.
Uh-oh.
I-I've never seen Serena so mad.
She'll get over it.
Well, I just hope I don't get home today and find I'm married to a 170-pound artichoke.
Oh, yeah, we'll be back in a minute.
Here we go.
Forgot my keys.
Dumb, huh?
No, here.
Here, I got mine.
No, I Th-That's okay.
I found them.
They were on the hall table.
Mm.
Sweetheart?
Hm?
You know, Serena really meant to be nice when she gave you that gift.
Uh, people give the way they know how, and Serena Never mind, Sam.
Now, you know how I feel about that stuff.
I know.
But Serena's really so sweet, a-and she means well.
Well, maybe she is, um, a little stubborn, but "Rotten" is the word.
Darrin, try and be nice.
That was the nicest word I could think of.
Okay, buster.
That does it.
Serena, that's unfair.
That's entrapment.
Okay.
I'm willing to forget about what you said if you will accept my gift.
You may not understand this, but I have too much pride to accept your witchcraft.
Ding-dong, you have all the gentility, graciousness and gratitude of a gorilla, which is what you are about to become.
Ask and you shall receive, you big ape.
Abner, did you hear that?
No.
It sounded like a wild animal.
Gladys, get away from the window.
Why?
Because you might get attacked.
By the animal?
No, by me.
I think I'll go over to the Stephens' and borrow some sugar, and find out what's going on.
Abner, Abner, you're not gonna believe this.
They wouldn't lend you a cup of sugar?
Some neighbors.
Some neighbors?
We may not have any neighbors.
There's a gorilla in the Stephens' living room.
Are you sure you weren't borrowing something stronger than sugar?
Hi, there.
That's right.
It's good old reliable Serena.
Friend to man and beast.
Now tell me you didn't hear that.
You think it's one of their kids?
Whatever it is, it's none of your business.
Come on, Abner.
We might be saving a life.
Come on!
Okay, okay.
Relax.
Monkeyshines are almost over.
Come on.
There's the gorilla, Abner, right in the middle of the living room.
Take a look.
Do I have to?
Thanks.
From the bottom of my paws.
Don't mention it.
Go on, Abner.
Take a look.
Then tell me who's crazy.
On those terms, I'll take a look.
If that's a gorilla, I'm King Kong.
And now we know who's crazy.
But, but But, but But, but Gladys, if you don't mind, I'm going back to my crossword puzzle.
Serena, will you stop bugging me?
I'm sorry.
But I forgot something.
What?
I forgot to get your apology.
Apology?
After what you've done to me?
Serena, you're suffering from a cracked cauldron.
Mortals do not talk to me that way, ding-dong.
It takes a beast to say things like that, and that is what you are, a beast.
Abner, Abner, I saw the gorilla again!
I-I mean something terrible has happened.
First I saw Mr. Stephens, then I heard a scream, then I looked in the other room, and I saw the gorilla.
That gorilla must have eaten Mr. Stephens.
Hello, operator?
Get me the corpse I mean, the cops.
You the lady who called about the gorilla?
I sure am.
I saw it with my own eyes.
Well, don't worry, the law is here.
Just tell it like it is.
Well, first I saw a gorilla in the Stephens' living room, then I saw Mr. Stephens.
Then when I looked again, all I saw was the gorilla.
For all I know, he might have eaten Mr. Stephens.
Now take it easy, Mrs., uh Uh, "Kravitz".
K-R-A-V Let's take a look inside.
I-T-Z.
And he's got a wife and two children.
The gorilla?
No.
Mr. Stephens.
Don't shoot.
Let me think.
I've finishing thinking.
We need help.
Headquarters, we have a gorilla in a residence at 1164 Morning Glory Circle.
You've got a problem, all right.
What have you been taking on your coffee break?
Okay, I'll, uh, send out a missing gorilla report and call Animal Regulations.
You need any help?
No, sir.
We're in charge here.
Johnson's Jungle Isle.
Police?
We ain't in.
I think we are, Alex.
Yes, sergeant.
A missing gorilla?
Let me look.
Tillie ain't missing, is she?
She's missing a mate is all.
Why?
The cops have got a gorilla in some guy's house.
Yes, sir, this is one of the Johnson brothers.
You got a gorilla?
What kind?
I mean, uh, is it a male or a female?
From the scream I heard, it's no lady.
That's our gorilla, all right.
Give me the address.
We'll go by and pick him up.
It's 1164 Morning Glory Circle.
Thank you, officer.
Whoever that gorilla is is the answer to Tillie's prayers.
And now we get maybe, uh, three, four little gorillas.
How did the gorilla get into a nice neighborhood like this?
I don't know, but he probably ate the whole Stephens family.
Madam, Johnson Brothers gorillas are vegetarian.
Let's have a look.
That's him, all right.
You folks stand back.
Ooh, you're not gonna kill the poor thing?
This is a tranquilizer gun.
It'll only knock him out.
I think he heard me.
If we can get this door open, we won't have to do any shooting.
Stand aside while I do my specialty.
Tillie's really gonna be happy.
Who's Tillie?
Tillie's a lady gorilla, and she's awful lonesome.
Well, you can relax now, Mrs., uh Kravitz.
Well, the house is empty, and there's no damage.
But that's impossible.
I saw Mr. Stephens in the den, and then I saw the gorilla.
Well, he must have gone out the back way, Mrs. Kravitz.
We checked the den.
There's no sign of a struggle, and everything's in order.
Oh.
Here you go.
In you go.
Alrighty.
Adam, sweetheart, you've been a very, very good boy today.
Why don't you take him upstairs, get him ready for his nap, and I'll be up in a minute.
It's been a long day, okay?
Okay, Mommy.
Okay.
Sweetheart, I'm home.
I came to tell you about the gorilla.
Gorilla?
Well, there was this gorilla in your house, and I called the police, and they came right away.
And then these men came from the jungle place What people?
What jungle place?
Johnson's Jungle Isle.
They were the ones that were missing the gorilla.
But he's safe now.
Oh.
Well, uh, yeah.
Thank you very much, Mrs. Kravitz.
Thank you very much.
Are you sure Mr. Stephens is all right?
Yes.
He's fi Thank you.
Serena?
Serena!
If you don't appear in two seconds, I'm bringing charges before the Royal Witches' Council.
"Royal Council adjourned until after royal hunt of the gorilla".
Oh!
Aunt Hagatha?
Aunt Hagatha?
Yes?
Oh.
Hi, Aunt Hagatha.
C-Could you stay with the kids for a while?
This is most inconvenient, Samantha.
You're taking me away from the maharaja of Janipur's polo match.
Polo match?
How come you're so dressed up?
It's a private polo match in the maharajah's living room.
Oh.
Well, Tabitha's upstairs helping Adam get ready for his nap.
Uh, she may need a little help.
I won't be long.
Bye-bye.
He don't seem to go too much for Tillie.
Would you feel romantic with two mugs like us looking on?
You're right.
Let's leave the lovebirds to themselves.
Yeah.
Darrin?
Darrin, is Is that you?
Now, listen carefully.
If that really is you, raise your right hand.
I-I mean, your right paw.
Oh.
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.
B-But I can't change you back till I find Serena.
But I can send you home.
Tillie, leave him alone.
I speak the truth Witch's honor.
Get Darrin home Or he's a goner  Sorry about that.
Yoo-hoo, Aunt Hagatha, I-I'm back.
You can leave now.
Oh.
Oh, sweetheart, I know it was a terrible thing that Serena did, and, well, what can I say, except Serena, I swear I'll put you into orbit for a thousand years.
And I have friends in very high places.
Shh-shh.
I know, sweetheart.
J-Just relax while While I go upstairs and check on the kids.
Did you hear what I heard?
I have closed my ears to everything.
Abner, the trouble with you is you show no compassion for your fellow neighbor.
Gladys, if you had compassion for your fellow neighbor, you'd move.
Yes, Mrs. Kravitz.
I sure do remember you.
I You gotta be kidding.
He's back at the Stephens' house?
Okay.
I'll I'll check with the Johnson Brothers.
Sergeant, you've gotta be kidding.
The sergeant says the gorilla's back at the Stephens' house.
He's gotta be kidding.
He ain't kidding.
Are you Mrs. Stephens?
Yes.
What seems to be the trouble?
Ma'am, are you harboring a gorilla in your home?
Of course not.
Well, there was one here earlier.
We saw him.
I heard about that.
Weird, huh?
We just got a report that he's back here.
And this neighborhood isn't zoned for gorillas.
So you're in violation of the zoning law.
We'll have to search the premises and make out a report.
I forbid it.
You're not searching my home.
Come on.
Out of the way, lady.
Where's your search warrant?
I just made an executive decision.
In situations involving the safety of citizens, we don't need any search warrant.
We don't even have to knock.
Kravitz dame said the gorilla was in the den.
Come on.
That's him.
"He".
What do you want?
Good grammar or a gorilla for Tillie?
Let's go.
I'll stay here with Mrs. Stephens.
You check out the kitchen and the rest of the house.
Somebody stole our gorilla.
There must be a crook around here somewhere.
You fellas see a gorilla around here?
Not me.
Did you see a gorilla, Pete?
Nope.
You're not gonna believe this, but you'd better.
The gorilla's on the roof!
He's on the roof!
Serena, this is your last chance.
Now, if you don't change Darrin back this second, I am going to send you up the River Styx without a paddle.
I thought you said you saw a gorilla up there?
I did!
What are you, some kind of radical?
Hey, fella, you seen a gorilla around here?
A gorilla?
Well, come to think of it, I-I did.
Just saw him walking down the street.
Let's go!
Okay, lady.
Now, why don't you just go on home before you get into trouble?
Ooh.
Where did you come from?
Originally from Babylon.
You know something, Jerry?
This is a nutty neighborhood.
Yeah.
Well, right now, let's get that one down off the roof.
Don't bother.
How'd that happen?
Jerry?
Mm-hm?
You fill out the report.
You got seniority.
John, if I fill this out, I won't even have a job.
Go ahead, sweetheart.
Yell your lungs out at Serena.
She won't blame you and neither will I. Honey, what's the use?
Everything's all right now.
I'm not really that mad at Serena.
Relatively speaking, that is.
Relatively?
Mm-hm.
How can I be as mad as I should be at Serena when I love her cousin so much?
Sweetheart?
Hm?
You were in that cage with Tillie for quite a while, weren't you?
Heh.
Too long.
Oh, I don't know.
I thought she was kinda cute.
Well, I didn't.
Well, she thought you were kind of cute.
She kept putting her arms around you.
Well, now that you mention it, she was sort of affectionate.
I guess you could say that, uh, we got to be a little more than friends.
That's what I thought.
Ah!
Sam.
I just didn't want you to miss Tillie, that's all.
Sam, as horrible as it was, I wouldn't have missed my experience with Tillie for anything in the world.
You know why?
Why?
Because those things are all part of the adjustment a man has to make when he marries a witch.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Okay, okay, come on.
Come on.
Morning swim is over.
Here, sweetheart.
You hop out here and grab this.
Mommy, are we ever gonna have a real pool?
Yes, when we can afford the right kind.
What kind is that?
The kind we can afford.
Oh.
Goodness.
He's all dripping wet.
Now, I'll tell you what.
You take Oopsie.
You take Adam upstairs, get him dried off, and get ready for breakfast, okay?
Okay.
Boy, I'd love that.
A big, beautiful pool.
I heard that.
I heard that poor child gasp for water.
Good morning, Mother.
To think my grandchildren, who are honor-born to ride the wings of the wind.
To think my grandchildren would be found swimming in this Olympic-size rubber band.
It's just too disgusting.
What else is new?
Oh.
Well, if it isn't El Cheapo.
Good morning, El Moutho.
Okay, you two, n-now, stop that.
Uh, sweetheart, would you please empty the pool?
I'm gonna take the kids shopping, and we won't be needing it for the rest of the afternoon.
How can that miserly husband of yours allow my grandchildren to spend another summer sweltering in the unbearable heat?
Mother, we don't exactly live at the corner of Sahara and Equator, so will you stop ranting?
As you wish, my darling.
But my grandchildren shall have what they want.
Mother, what did you do?
About what?
Did you pop a pool into our back yard?
Why?
Darrin's out there.
I was out there.
But I just came in with the tide.
Mm.
Hi.
Mother got rid of the pool.
Isn't that nice?
One down, one to go.
I won't have time for breakfast, Sam.
My morning swim made me a little late for work.
Oh, but you look so refreshed.
Well, under this calm, refreshed exterior, is a burning urge to invite you to a lynching, Endora.
Yours.
No one seems to appreciate me.
Mother, it isn't as if we don't appreciate you.
We will get our own pool with our own money when we can afford it.
Which will probably be never.
Keep your cool, sweetheart.
I'll be out of the office most of the day.
Larry and I have appointments all over town.
And when I come home, if your mother isn't here, I won't exactly be disappointed.
Don't worry, she won't be here.
Mm.
All in all, we didn't do badly.
We're in with the Patterson account and Pridewell is a definite maybe.
We can still land the Cushman Restaurant account too.
If you fellas are gonna talk any longer, I'm gonna have to put my meter down again.
Ah.
I didn't realize we were at the office.
Time stands still when he counts money in the bank.
Heh-heh-heh.
Oh, Darrin, take care of the cab, will you?
I just remembered I'm expecting a call from the coast.
Oh.
Thanks a lot.
Here, keep the change.
Ah.
Thanks, thanks.
Hey!
You forgot something.
Just what I need, one more thing.
Heh-heh.
Just shove it under the arm here.
Okay.
Thank you.
Right.
Yes, Darrin?
Uh.
Larry, did you leave something in the cab?
I don't know.
Did you find something?
If you left it behind.
If I left it behind and you found it, I must have lost it.
Or let me put it another way.
What are we talking about?
I'm asking you if you left an envelope in the cab.
Well, what's in it?
Hold on.
Hello?
Darrin?
Darrin?
Uh.
Yes.
Well, what is it?
What is what?
What you found.
What I found?
Oh, you're asking what I found.
It's, uh It's, uh It's a not yours.
What?
Uh, it's just a, um, message from my mother-in-law.
How sweet.
Does she often send you little notes?
Oh, yeah.
Big ones too.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Darrin.
Wanna hear something funny?
Sure.
Really funny?
Yeah.
Hilarious, in fact?
Uh-oh.
It's getting funnier every second.
You're not going to believe it.
Sweetheart, I love the way you come right to the point.
Uh, maybe I can help you.
It has something to do with Mother, right?
Right.
We said we wouldn't put in a pool until we could afford it, so she conveniently zapped up a plain, unmarked envelope with I don't know how many thousands of dollars.
Uh, where did she zap it up?
In the cab.
I would appreciate it if you get hold of her, and tell her to zap it out of my life.
We're not interested.
Y-yeah.
Okay, sweetheart.
Bye.
Mother!
Mother, is it possible that you could be lurking somewhere nearby?
I never lurk.
What's your problem?
Mother, that wasn't funny.
What?
It wasn't funny at all.
I don't know what you're talking about.
As a matter of fact, it was insulting.
You must have a pretty low opinion of Darrin to think that he wouldn't see through something so obvious.
You're quite right about my opinion of Durwood, but if you don't tell me what this is all about, I shall scream and shatter glass all over Westport.
Darrin found a ton of money in a taxi.
Wonderful.
I hope he found enough to get his parched children a pool.
He found enough to get them an entire ocean.
And I will thank you to zap it back where it came from.
You know I always take credit where credit is due, and once in a while, where it isn't.
But in this case, if I were to do such a thing, I would be much more clever.
That feeble zap was not mine.
Witch's honor?
Witch's honor.
Well, if you didn't leave the money in the cab, who did?
Are you the gentleman that called the dispatcher?
It was I. Oh, yeah.
Two rides ago.
First time anything like that ever happened to me.
Somebody calling the dispatcher requesting my services.
You give a very smooth ride.
Thank you.
Where to?
Uh.
Nowhere.
Oh, I get it.
You lost something?
Yes.
Something very dear to me.
Something I want back badly.
I know the guy that's got it.
That's him.
Follow him.
Follow him?
Why?
Why don't you just go over and ask for the envelope?
This area is too crowded.
To ask a fella for an envelope?
Maybe he wouldn't be able to hear me.
Follow him.
That's a lot of money.
One hundred thousand dollars.
I counted it.
This guy lives at 1164 Morning Glory Circle.
I'm going in there now after the money.
If something should happen to me, you know.
Anyway, I need you to pick me up.
Hey, don't get so heavy about it.
Nobody's perfect.
Hm.
At first, I hoped the money was counterfeit.
But I took $100 bill down to the bank, and no such luck.
Your mother must have zapped it out of a Federal Reserve Bank.
Darrin, I know my mother is not responsible.
She gave me her witch's honor.
Her witch's honor is like getting the Boy Scout salute from Benedict Arnold.
Darrin, you're acting very flaky.
May I join you?
I love to watch him go to pieces.
I'm glad you're here, O weird one.
Samantha, let me change him into a ripe melon in a field of fruit flies.
Never mind that.
Just zap this money back where it came from.
I don't know where it came from.
Now, I better be leaving, Samantha, before I make him get down on all four knees and apologize.
Four knees?
He'll be a billy goat.
Sam, can't you send it back?
Darrin, did you ever think of the possibility that this money might have been lost by someone?
I called the lost and found at the cab company.
Somebody lost an umbrella with a rib missing, and some lady lost a pair of gloves.
But nobody lost an envelope with enough money in it to choke a horse.
That's it.
That's the answer to whose money it might be.
A horse lost it?
A horseplayer or a bookie.
Or, who knows, maybe even a gangster who'd be afraid to report the loss.
Oh, come on, Sam.
I mean, gangsters?
What you won't think of to defend your mother.
Darrin, you're overreacting.
I know Mother's been a problem in the past, but believe me, this incident is not her work.
How can you be so sure?
Unless it's because you What?
Oh, no, you wouldn't have done it.
Darrin, are you accusing me?
I didn't accuse you.
Oh, yes, you did.
You're being obstinate, stubborn, childish and pigheaded.
Terrific.
You didn't leave out anything.
Oh, yes, I did.
You are being intractable, obtuse, unyielding and pigheaded.
You used that one already.
Well, there are just a few more I may use again, so I think I'd better go out and get some air for a little while.
Thank you very much.
My pleasure.
And I hope nobody comes for it.
Where are you going?
I don't know.
I may go to a movie, I may go and visit Louise, I may go to the moon.
But wherever I go, I will have better company than here.
Here, keep the change.
Ah, thanks.
How do you do?
How do you do?
What can I do for you?
My name is Rudolph Kosko.
"Rudolph Kosko.
Public relations and advertising".
What a coincidence.
I'm in advertising too.
Heh.
We have something else in common: The envelope.
The envelope?
Yes, the one the cab driver found and gave to you.
It's a very special envelope in that it contains $100,000 of which I am very fond.
Oh, that envelope.
Heh.
Yes.
Well, if you'll just give it to me, I'll be on my way.
Uh, I'm afraid I can't do that.
J-j-just who do you think you are?
I am somebody who, when you use an ill-considered tone to me, you do something more courageous than you realize.
Well, what are you trying to say?
I'm saying I want my $100,000 back, and I don't want any complications.
Oh, there are no complications.
Good.
Except for one.
One little complication.
I don't have the money.
I mean, it's around, but it's not.
One little complication.
Where is it?
My wife has it, but she's not here.
Where is she?
Well, she might be anywhere.
The movies, the moon.
If that's supposed to be funny, I don't get it.
Call your wife.
I wouldn't know where to start.
I'll start by calling Louise.
Yeah, you do that.
Louise.
Hello, Louise.
Look, I know Sam isn't there yet, but as soon as she comes What?
Oh, the kids are fine.
Look, as soon as she walks in I'm fine too.
And my mother is fine.
Look, Louise, as soon as Sam gets there, tell her to call me.
She's not there yet.
Heh-heh-heh.
Men.
They're all alike.
Darrin called and sounded like he was having a nervous breakdown.
Oh, what a performance.
Well, I don't blow up at Darrin often, but this time he really asked for it.
That's him again.
Yes, Darrin?
Oh, she's here, but I'm not sure she wants to talk to you.
Yes, I do.
Shh.
Let him stew for a while.
I'm sorry, Darrin, but you'll just have to call back.
Louise.
Well, let him cook till he's well-done.
You wouldn't have understood him anyway.
He's so incoherent.
Incoherent about what?
Oh.
Something about somebody coming over for the money, life or death.
It's always life or death.
Louise, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but it sounds like there might be something wrong.
Mr. Kosko, I'm so glad you showed up.
I knew that money belonged to someone.
Heh.
It usually does, and I'd like to have it back.
Well, now, I-I don't know if I should.
I mean, you must admit it was rather careless of you.
I mean, $100,000 is a lot of money to leave in the back of a cab, or anywhere.
Except a bank.
Lady, I know it's a lot, but since we're approaching the dinner hour, let us conclude our little transaction without further stalling.
Sam, why don't you just whip out the money and give it to Mr. Kosko?
Yeah, well, I will, but I want to ask him something first.
Mr. Kosko, where did you get all that money?
I got it selling Girl Scout cookies, and I'd like it back now.
Now.
Come on, Sam.
I'm sure Mr. Kosko has a lot more cookies to sell.
He's a very busy man.
This is a very busy house.
Who are you?
I'm associated with Mr. Kosko.
This is Mr. Braun.
Oh, I get it.
You're the brains and you're the Braun.
Hey, that's not bad.
I'll use that.
I don't get it.
Ever thought of putting in a revolving door?
Heh-heh.
Darrin, I've put together some rough layouts on the Cushman account.
Using women's lib Oh, I didn't know you had guests.
Hi, Larry.
Sam.
This is Mr. Kosko and Mr. Braun.
Of Kosko and Braun, public relations and advertising.
Kosko and Braun, public relations and advertising.
If I didn't know I could count on your loyalty, I'd suspect you were negotiating with another company.
Oh, I'm not negotiating with them.
They're, um, negotiating with me.
And to think I ran over here as a pal, offering you ideas for the Cushman account.
Larry, they're not even in advertising.
They just advertise they're in advertising.
Well, what business are they in?
Money.
I-it's a long story, Larry, but that envelope I told you about this morning had money in it, and You mean you took money from them already?
I'll explain later.
I can give a bonus too.
How much money was in that envelope?
Larry, will you let me explain later?
No, no.
I'll give you a 15 percent raise right now.
Forget it.
I'm not leaving until I know where we stand.
Darrin Take it.
I'll take it.
Larry, we were here first.
And a $2500 bonus.
I'll take it.
Good.
That'll teach you to try to steal my employees.
Sam.
Ungh!
I'll see you tomorrow.
You work for that fruitcake?
Mm-hm.
Well, shall we proceed?
Without a doubt.
Well, Sam, get them the money.
Okay, but you'll have to turn around.
I don't want you to see where my hiding place is.
Let's turn around.
You too.
It's her hiding place.
Right.
Gentlemen.
I'm having a little trouble remembering where my hiding place is.
Would this, uh, jog your memory?
Oh, now, wait a minute.
Lady, the boys don't like having their collections tampered with.
The boys?
The boy We want our money, and we want it now.
Would you consider a check?
I'm gonna count to three.
Sam, give them the money.
I'm counting.
One, two  Hey, what's going on here?
Something weird's happening.
Lady, did you do something sneaky?
Okay, we know you're in there, Kosko, Braun.
Come out with your hands up.
The house is surrounded.
Sounds like the whole police force is outside.
Come on out, Kosko, Braun.
Gladly.
Anything to get out of this crazy place.
We're coming peacefully.
See?
We're unarmed.
You know something, Kosko?
I think we're going bananas.
Oh, am I glad you fellas happened by.
We just didn't happen by.
We heard all the sirens.
We thought something was up.
Like I always say, police are always around when you need them.
Officer, these gentlemen are members of some boys' club who make collections.
Maybe you'd like to see what they've collected.
And you seemed like such a nice lady.
Officer, we didn't do nothing, honest.
Who said you did anything honest?
Hey, there's a lot of loot here.
Come on.
Let's go downtown and do a lot of talking.
Come on.
Sweetheart, I'll never doubt you again.
And I'm sorry for the It was all part of a master plan.
Master plan?
Yes.
To give Larry a reason for offering you a 15 percent raise and a $2500 bonus.
Is that true?
No.
But it would have been rather clever.
All right, Larry, all right.
If you insist.
See you in the morning.
Is that Larry Tate a beautiful person?
Is he one of the great people of the world?
I told him the truth about Kosko and Braun.
And do you think he'd back down on the raise and the six-week vacation?
He would.
He did.
Because you're a yo-yo.
Well, the bad fairy is here again.
Mother, you missed a fair share of excitement.
Would I miss it?
Figures.
Snoopy wouldn't miss a thing.
But dum-dum here has the brain of a dropout guppy.
Why did you tell Larry Tate the truth?
He need never have known.
Darrin would know.
Ick, ick, ick.
It's an act of sheer stupidity.
Maybe it was stupid, but I love him for it.
What?
Oh.
Oh, sweetheart, you know what I didn't mean.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Feet apart toes in knees together legs bent elbows wide and head over the ball.
How do I look?
Like an accident victim about to putt a ball.
Now, how do I look?
Like a man who's gonna break par today.
Come in.
Hi, Sam.
Darrin.
Hi, Larry.
Larry.
That's a new putter, huh?
Yeah.
That's a lovely putter.
Anything wrong, Larry?
It's Mother Flanagan.
Who's she?
She's not a she.
She's an Irish stew, and she's a he.
It just hurts me here Okay, Larry.
Let me have it.
Certainly.
That's why I brought it.
For inspiration.
Uh, let me warn you, Larry.
Uh, this putter also doubles as a deadly weapon.
It's hard to talk sensibly to a man who's about to mug you.
So I'll fill you in, Sam.
Mother Flanagan is leaving Sloan and Sloan Advertising and thinking of coming with us.
Only thinking, mind you.
Do you follow me so far?
Mm-hm.
Oh, don't follow him, Sam.
He's leading you into a trap.
And it isn't a sand trap.
Well, Mother Flanagan was supposed to be in a week from Monday, but But he's not coming in a week from Monday.
He's coming in tomorrow.
And all the work that Darrin was supposed to do next week, you want him to do today, right?
That's a brilliant summation, Sam.
Larry, you have a heart the size of an overgrown pea.
May I?
Mm.
Lovely balance.
Mind if I borrow it?
Yes.
Thank you.
You mean y You're not gonna work on the Flanagan ideas with me?
Of course I'm going to work on them, but you think better sitting and I think better walking.
I'll be back right after my walk, and we'll compare scores.
Notes.
Ha-ha.
I hope it pours.
The craziest thing just happened.
There was one lousy cloud in the sky, and wham.
How you doing?
Terrible.
Every time I get close to an idea, all I can see is Larry out on that golf course.
Well, forget about him.
Concentrate.
Try thinking music.
A musical campaign.
A jingle.
Something cute.
Like, uh: If it's for Irish stew You're carin' You don't have to go To Erin Ask for Mother Flanagan And you'll buy Can and can again  Well, what do you want, good lyrics or good taste?
Hello, darling.
Good morning, Mother.
Darwin.
Terrific.
This is going to help a lot.
Typhoon Mary just blew in.
Darrin.
Not to see you, Durwood.
I expected you to be out on the golf course hitting home runs or shooting pucks, or whatever it is you do.
Grandmama.
Oh.
There's my little princess.
Hi, Grandmama.
Grandmama has a delicious surprise for you.
Oh, goody.
Heh.
Well, it will be if certain mortals don't spoil it.
That depends on what certain witches have in mind.
Oh, Samantha.
Oh, what was the happiest day in your life?
The day I married Darrin.
I don't mean "insanely" happy.
I mean just "happy" happy.
Well, I've had a lot of those days.
Do you remember the Unicorn Handicap?
The Unicorn Handicap?
Yes, it's It's just like the Kentucky Derby, only with unicorns.
Well, they're off and running, and Grandmama wants to take you.
Forget it.
Tabitha's not going anywhere, except maybe to the park to play mortal games.
Mother, I hope you understand.
You too, sweetheart.
I understand he's behaving like a petulant little boy.
You may think so, Endora, but the truth is.
I happen to be the head of this household.
And I'm man enough to stand up to you.
I doubt it.
Don't, Darrin.
Stop, Mother!
Too late.
Now your appearance has caught up with your mentality.
Sam.
Uh, Tabitha.
Would you mind going outside and waiting for the mailman?
Oh, gee.
I miss all the fun.
Tabitha.
Okay, Daddy.
Mother.
Mm.
You change him back the way he was.
In due time, darling.
When he's ready to apologize.
In the meantime I suggest he see a tailor.
Sam.
Do something.
Don't just stand there.
Well, you know I can't undo Mother's spells.
Oh, sorry.
So stupid of me to forget.
Uh however, I, um I-I can substitute for your friendly tailor.
Sweetheart, try to stay calm.
Calm?
I've just been stunted out of 30 years' growth.
Now, how do you expect me to be calm?
Get your mother back.
Well, I'll try.
But it might be easier if you'd apologize.
Apologize?
For what?
For daring to stand up to her?
For having a difference of opinion?
You're hardly in a position to debate the issue.
The door was open, and, uh, heh  Sam, Darrin's putter worked like magic.
Hi there.
Um, thi This is Darrin's nephew.
Darrin's nephew, this is Mr. Tate.
Hello there, Darrin's nephew.
Does he have a name?
His name is, uh  Marvin.
Peter.
Uh, Marvin.
Peter!
It's Marvin Peter.
And I also have a last name: Stephens.
Well, Marvin Peter, you look a lot like your Uncle Darrin.
By the way, where is Darrin?
Oh, well, he was up to his hips in Mother Flanagan's Irish Stew until a few minutes ago.
Uh, he He just ran down to the nursery uh, to get a few things for the garden.
Well, then I'll just hang around till he gets back.
I've got a couple of ideas for the Flanagan account I wanna throw at him.
Well, uh, Larry, the thing is he could be gone for hours.
Well, it's either here, or going home and listening to Louise and her string quartet murder Bach.
I'll leave when they leave.
Which should be around 5:30.
Here's the mail, Mommy.
Oh, uh, thank you, sweetheart.
Auntie Samantha, could Tabitha and I go out and play in the park?
I can't think of a better idea.
Boy, this is gonna be fun.
Yes.
Now, uh, e-enjoy yourself, kids.
Okay, auntie.
Marvin has a problem with his voice, doesn't he?
Yeah, well uh, h-he's at that awkward age.
Larry, fix yourself a drink, will you?
I have something urgent I have to take care of in the kitchen.
Boil and bubble Toil and trouble.
Mother, get here On the double.
"Not until I get an apology from Durwood".
Ooh!
Sweetheart.
Is the coast clear?
Sure, come on in.
Larry left about 15 minutes ago.
Boy, we had so much fun.
I mean, Daddy played basketball with the boys, and they made him captain.
He was better than almost anybody.
Well.
Why not?
I was the only kid on the team who was an all-star forward at Missouri State.
Uh, Tabitha, why don't you run up and get ready for dinner?
Okay.
Herbie.
I thought I told you to get lost.
Can't get lost.
I live down the block.
Hi.
Hello.
Boy, something smells good.
Well, I'm sure your parents will have a lovely dinner for you.
Nah.
On Saturdays we usually have roast duck or lobster or Cornish hen, or some dumb thing like that.
Well, this is even dumber.
It's Irish stew.
Mother Flanagan's Stew?
How come?
Well, I was so busy with the incan Uh, I-I mean, trying to reach Mother, that I forgot to take the roast out of the freezer.
So it's Mother Flanagan to the rescue.
Wow.
Sure gives a guy an appetite.
Uh, it's a little early for dinner.
Not for me.
I usually eat early.
Uh would you like some, Herbie?
Would I?
Okay, sit down.
You boys can have an early dinner, and then it's home for you, Herbie.
You'd have been proud of Marvin, ma'am.
I bet you when he grows up, he's gonna be a basketball star.
The reason I followed you home is we're playing the Blackhawks tomorrow.
We sure could use you.
I told you, Herbie.
I won't be able to play tomorrow.
He, uh He has homework.
Gee.
We really need him.
Because without you, we don't stand a chance against the Blackhawks.
Sorry, Herbie.
No chance.
Would you consider some player incentive?
How about 50 cents?
My daddy is loaded, and maybe  Ah, here you are, Herbie.
You know I've never had Irish stew in my whole life.
Now I know why.
Y-you mean, you don't like it?
I guess it takes getting used to.
If I had more time, I'd get used to it.
But my folks will get worried if I don't get home soon.
Thanks.
I'll be checking with you tomorrow about playing, Marvin.
The kid's right.
It's blech.
Now, what about your mother?
All you have to do is apologize.
Endora, I'm sorry.
I'm contrite.
I'm apologizing.
I'm even grateful.
You mustn't overdo.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Ta-ta.
What do you mean, you're "even grateful"?
I mean, if she hadn't turned me into a kid, I wouldn't have met Herbie.
And if I hadn't met Herbie, I wouldn't have realized the problem isn't advertising.
It's taste.
It's as simple as that.
Which means now I have even a bigger problem.
What's that?
Convincing Larry to give up a quarter of a million dollars in commission.
Well, that shouldn't be difficult.
No?
No.
Just invite him over to taste it.
You think that'll do it?
No question about it.
Ooh.
You mean, it doesn't taste good to you.
And it may not taste good to me but that's because our palates have been spoiled by expensive food.
We can't appreciate the humble Irish stew.
The word is "horrible".
That's your opinion.
Well, our job is to convince the public that they like Mother Flanagan's Irish Stew, whether they like it or not.
Larry, don't you think you're being a little hypocritical?
I call it compassionate.
The Mother Flanagan people think their stew is yummy, and I'm not the one to break their hearts with the truth.
Well, Larry, have you ever heard of integrity?
Yes.
And, Darrin, I didn't become the president of McMann & Tate without bending my integrity occasionally.
And this is one of those "occasionallys".
So when Flanagan comes here tomorrow, see that you have some mouthwatering ideas.
Is there any bicarb in the house?
Okay.
Sock it to me.
I've been up most of the night nursing a sick Mother Flanagan, and just a moment ago, I think I came up with the right medicine.
Oh?
Which is the following: We tell the truth about the product.
Don't be ridiculous.
No, no, no, no.
Hear me out.
The idea is integrity with humor.
Well, for instance: Uh, "Mother Flanagan's Stew may not be a gourmet treat, but at least it's nourishing".
I don't know, Darrin.
Okay, how about this?
"You can say this for Mother Flanagan Irish Stew: Even if you don't like it, all you've blown is 59 cents".
And the account.
Darrin, you must be out of your tree.
And that's probably him.
Now, let's hear some positive ideas.
Mr. Flanagan.
Welcome.
Hello, Tate.
Ha, ha, ha!
Uh, Samantha, Darrin.
May I present Sean Flanagan's the name.
Irish stew is me game.
How do you do?
How do you do?
I'm sorry to intrude on your sacred Sunday.
Not at all, Mr. Flanagan.
At McMann & Tate, Sunday is just the day before Monday.
Ah, cut out the blarney, Tate.
If I wasn't so rich and you weren't so greedy, you'd tell me to go to the devil.
Couldn't be helped.
Could we get started?
I have to catch a plane for Dublin.
Uh, before you get started, how about a wee nip of Irish whiskey?
Good idea, Mrs. Stephens.
Ha-ha.
Would you help me get out the ice?
Uh, sure.
Darrin, I have an idea.
Oh, I certainly hope so.
Why not let Marvin tell Mr. Flanagan the truth?
Sam, you're not suggesting I go through that kid routine again?
Think of it this way: You won't have to bend your integrity.
You just have to shrink it a little.
Besides, Mr. Flanagan has to catch a plane for Dublin.
Okay, Sam.
Zap away.
Okay, kid.
Do your stuff.
Where's Darrin?
Oh, the pilot's out in the stove.
He's fixing it.
I'll have mine on the rocks, Tate.
Uh, right.
Uh, right.
Uh, this is my nephew, Marvin.
Marvin, you know Mr. Tate.
Hello, Mr. Tate, sir.
How are you, Marvin?
And this is Mr. Flanagan.
And a top of the morning to you too, Mr. Finnegan.
No, sweetheart, that's "Flanagan".
As in Mother Flanagan's Irish Stew.
Oh, her.
What do you mean, "Oh, her," young fella?
Nothing, sir.
Have you ever tasted Mother Flanagan's Irish Stew?
Do I have to answer that, Auntie Samantha?
Of course not, darling.
You can run out and play.
Uh, no, no.
You stay right where you are.
Have you ever tasted it?
Yes, sir, I have.
Ah.
And, uh, how did you like it?
I'm a Boy Scout, sir, and I cannot tell a lie.
Please don't ask me that question.
You can go now, Marvin.
No, no, no.
You stay.
I want an answer.
The answer is that I tasted it, and I didn't care for it very much, sir.
There are a lot of radical subversives infiltrating the Boy Scouts, and, uh Sam, would you please get Darrin?
Of course.
That kid has a weird voice.
He's at that awkward age.
Thanks, honey.
Good.
Now we can get down to business.
Yeah, well, where's that kid?
I wanna talk to him again.
I'll get him.
He wants Marvin again.
So if you don't mind, Sam, once more with feeling.
You asked to see me, sir?
Yes, I did.
Now, come here.
Why didn't you like the stew?
Because it didn't taste very good.
Ha-ha.
What would a little kid know?
Ha.
It's only my opinion, sir.
The kid's a finicky eater.
Oh, no, Mr. Tate, sir.
I eat everything that is set before me.
But I couldn't finish the stew.
Scout's honor.
Naturally.
The exotic seasoning is not for a child's taste.
Oh, shut up, Tate.
Why can't we be as honest as this lad?
That stew is based on me sainted mother's secret recipe.
But listening to this lad has brought back memories of meself as a child.
I remember I hated that stew.
And as I grew up, I must have been brainwashed into liking it.
The truth is the stew was lousy then, and it's lousy now.
Uh, Marvin, could I see you for a minute?
Coming, auntie.
It worked.
I heard.
Now put me back.
I'm beginning to feel like a yo-yo.
Mr. Flanagan?
Mr. Flanagan?
Huh?
Is anything wrong, Mr. Flanagan?
Wrong?
No, no, no, no.
I was I was just thinking about all those warehouses all over the country full of.
Mother Flanagan's Irish Stew, just sitting there, rotting away.
It doesn't have to just sit there, rotting away.
It doesn't?
Uh, Mother Flanagan's Stew sells for 59 cents a can, right?
Right.
How much of that is profit?
Ah, well, uh, with, uh, shipping and delivery, we probably eke out The truth, Mr. Flanagan.
The truth?
Well, uh The truth is we make about 30 cents a can profit.
Why did I say that?
Don't worry.
It'll be our secret.
Okay.
Now, suppose you lower the price from 59 cents a can to 39 cents a can.
You'd still make a profit of 10 cents a can, right?
There wouldn't be enough buyers at any price.
There would be if Mr. Flanagan will make one small change in the packaging.
Hm?
What's that?
All you have to do is change the labels from "Mother Flanagan's Irish Stew" to "Mother Flanagan's Doggy Stew".
Sam!
Ha!
She's joking, of course.
No, no, no, wait.
I think Mrs. Stephens might have something here.
A brilliant idea.
And think of the possibilities.
Do you know how many dogs there are in the United States?
Millions.
Why, those warehouses will be empty in no time.
And how's this for a TV commercial?
A pair of hands empties a can of Mother Flanagan's Doggy Stew into a dish.
Uh, a beautiful Irish setter lopes into the shot and gulps it down hungrily.
The The TV announcer's voice comes in "If it's good enough for the champion, Erin O'Cork, it's good enough for your pup".
And it's only 39 cents a can.
Mother may never forgive me, but I think I've saved the business.
Do you realize we got rid of Flanagan in less than an hour?
And I've still got time for 18 holes.
That must be Larry.
Hi.
Oh, hi.
You must be Marvin's uncle.
Yeah?
Oh.
Yeah.
Is he ready?
For what?
Isn't Marvin coming to play basketball with us?
Gee, uh, I-I don't know.
It figures.
He's sore at me 'cause I was rude.
Rude?
My mother said I was when I told her about not eating the stew.
Herbie, you were honest.
Uh, I think that kind of honesty should be rewarded.
Don't you, sweetheart?
Please let Marvin play.
We're playing the Blackhawks, and they're a bunch of bullies.
We won't have a chance without Marvin.
You got yourself a basketball player.
I'll get him.
I'm getting him, Sam!
I got him.
Hi.
Hi.
Come on, let's go.
Bye, Auntie Samantha.
Hi, Sam.
Where's Darrin?
Oh, uh, he had a previous engagement.
But we had a date for golf.
Well, he He had a previous date for basketball.
I don't get it.
He could have called me.
It's the least he Basketball?
He's gone off to play basketball?
At his age?
Larry there are some times when he's a lot younger than you think.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
You can send me two pounds of cooking onions, two pounds of butter, a head of lettuce, and 60 cans of wax beans.
Yeah, that's right, 60.
Thank you.
Hi.
They're having a sale on wax beans.
Three cents off a can.
By buying 60 cans, I save $1.80.
It also takes care of our wax bean-buying for the next 14 or 15 years.
Are you making fun of me?
Of course not.
It just proves that you've achieved the epitome in mortal housewife logic.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mom.
Where'd I put the scissors?
Sure.
She wants to talk to you.
Oh.
Uh, hello, Mrs. Stephens.
What a pleasant surprise.
Where are you?
Oh, I'm only a few minutes away.
But I thought it would be a shame not to stop in to see you when I'm so close.
Well, gee, I, uh Maybe we could do a little shopping this afternoon.
I know you don't usually have very much time for me, but if you're not too busy.
Uh, no, no, not at all.
I was just sitting around.
Oh, good.
I'll be there in a few minutes.
Oops.
Darrin, I-I'm sorry.
Honey, I know I shouldn't have done that, but, uh, well, your mother'll be over any minute, and I didn't want her to see the kitchen a mess.
Oh, that's okay.
What's that?
Nothing.
Just a box.
Then why are you hiding it?
It's nothing, really.
Oh, come on.
Let me see.
No.
Come on.
Let me see.
No.
Oh, Darrin, please.
Oh, okay.
"Sweetheart, a special reward for conduct above and beyond love, honor and no witchcraft.
Love, D." Go ahead.
Open it.
Well, I can't.
I mean, I don't deserve it.
Not after I Well, you know.
That was an emergency.
It doesn't count.
Go ahead.
Open it.
I've been dying to give it to you anyway.
Well, okay.
Oh.
Oh, Darrin, it's beautiful, but Go ahead.
Put it on.
But I feel so guilty about what I did.
I'm not going to discuss it.
Besides, I'd better get over to Larry's.
Darrin, I just can't take it.
Force yourself.
Are you sure you don't mind?
Positive.
It really is beautiful.
Sam.
I didn't do that.
Well, don't look at me.
Now, what is that?
It's two hiccups, a bike and a trike.
But what does it mean?
It means there is something very, very wrong.
What is very, very wrong is that my mother will be here in a few minutes.
I know.
I know.
And I was hoping just once something weird wouldn't be going on.
I know.
I know.
You just said that.
I know.
I know.
Sam.
Well?
Bewitched.
Sam, you have my total permission to get rid of these bikes with witchcraft of any kind.
Thank you, sweetheart.
Hen's teeth, frog's hair.
Bat feathers And a round square.
What came here Without permission.
Return now To your first condition Darrin, there must be a short circuit in my powers.
I'd better call Dr. Bombay.
That clown?
That fraud?
I won't have him in the house.
Which would you rather have?
Dr. Bombay in the house or your mother in an institution?
Get him right away.
There's no time to lose.
That has to be your mother.
You answer the door.
Keep her occupied.
Take her upstairs and let her play with the kids.
I'll get Dr. Bombay.
What about these bikes?
Well, we'll tell her we've given up jogging for biking.
That's ridiculous.
You have a better idea?
Hi, Mom.
Darrin, dear.
You're looking simply wonderful.
And, Samantha, how are you?
Just fine.
What's all this?
Oh, we're really into bikes.
Great exercise.
Right, Sam?
The greatest.
What kind of exercise do you get from a motorcycle?
Well, first you join one of these gangs and from then on things get pretty strenuous.
Oh, really  Where did that come from?
The bike shop.
I mean, how did it get here?
It wasn't here a second ago.
Oh, Mother, you don't think it just suddenly appeared out of nowhere, do you?
Well, I No.
No, I guess not.
Come on upstairs, Mom.
I know you're anxious to see Tabitha and Adam.
Oh, I do hope they recognize me.
You know, I don't get to see those children much anymore.
Oh, come on, Mom.
Quit kidding.
Who's kidding?
Darrin, you're pushing me.
Oh, sorry, Mom.
Dr. Bombay.
Calling Dr. Bombay.
Emergency.
Come right away.
I hope you realize you took me away from my golf game.
That's what you wear when you play golf?
It is when I'm playing "a round" with my nurse.
Get it?
"Around" with  What's the problem?
Ah, that's the problem.
I had the hiccups, and they produced all these bikes, and now I don't know how to get rid of them.
Splendid.
Start again at the beginning, while I unpack my electronic diagnostic computer machine.
Darling, come kiss Grandma, sweetheart.
Oh, what a sweet big girl.
And Adam.
Isn't he a fine big boy?
Adam, where's your teddy bear?
Hasn't he gotten bigger?
Dr. Bombay, after I accepted the bracelet, I hiccupped and that's when the first bike appeared.
Let's get on with it.
The bikes are peculiarly significant.
Oh?
Uh, what?
What do they mean?
Who knows?
We'll feed the question to the computer.
Aha.
Mm-hm.
It's obvious to the trained mind, who has the help of a trained machine, that when a witch promises not to do witchcraft, it's unnatural.
Creates an inner conflict.
Now, when you broke your promise, your guilt feelings precipitated a crisis, causing your subconscious to produce these bikes, to tell you that you showed a lack of "wheel" power.
That's ridiculous.
Ridiculous but true.
All you need is a "prank-quilizer" treatment.
Prank-quilizer?
Stops your subconscious playing pranks on you.
Right elbow.
Henbane Hemlock, jimsonweed.
With nasturtium And hickory seed.
Now her strength Shall be rebuilt.
And eliminate all of guilt.
Thank you, Dr. Bombay.
Think nothing of it.
And now I must get back to my nurse, Hazel.
Cute little witch.
Get it?
Witch Hazel.
Witch hazel.
Well, have fun, you two.
Goodbye, Darrin, dear.
See you later.
See you later, Mom.
Serena, you may find this hard to believe, because I certainly do, but am I glad to see you.
Well, there's a first time for everything, poopsie.
We need your help.
Something awful has happened.
I know.
Your mother arrived.
And then something good happened.
She left.
Ha-ha!
Serena, please.
Earlier, Sam started hiccupping, and then she I know all about it, ding-dong.
Or have your forgotten I am a witch?
Right.
You're a witch, so you'd know what made the mirror disappear, right?
Wrong.
It is strictly a medical problem.
Well, now I think I'll go up and check on the little angels.
Then, Serena, please call Dr. Bombay and tell him what happened.
Dumbo, I am not a medical telephone exchange.
I am babysitting as a favor to Sammy.
Serena, please?
Calling Dr. Bombay.
Calling Dr. Bombay.
Emergency.
Come right away.
Well, he should be here in an hour or so.
An hour or so?
What are we supposed to do in the meantime?
Larry, come in.
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Notice the smile?
Very nice.
This smile you're admiring is composed of six parts of gin to one part of vermouth, and the sparkle in the eyes comes from a twist of lemon peel.
That's a very good suggestion.
See if you can put together a smile like that for me.
What's the matter, Darrin?
Nothing.
You're having a little hassle with Samantha, aren't you?
No.
Then why are you so jumpy?
Yes, Serena?
Serena!
Hi, cotton-top.
Where did you come from?
The stork brought me.
Have you heard from Dr. Bombay yet?
Oh, he'll be here shortly.
He's an honorary official at an Australian racetrack.
He's the man who says, "Gentlemen, start your kangaroos".
Serena, why don't you go back upstairs and check on the kids?
I'm hip.
Where'd she go?
You heard me tell her to, uh, go upstairs and make sure the kids are all right.
Serena's got a lot of get-up-and-go.
Oh.
She must've taken those steps three at a time.
Suddenly I feel a great need to freshen up my smile.
Careful there, fellow.
Don't you signal before you turn?
Larry, you remember Dr. Bombay?
Yes, uh, I've had the pleasure.
If you'll excuse us, I, uh, wanna talk to Dr. Bombay alone in the kitchen for a moment.
And just as she was leaving, the mirror disappeared.
That's impossible.
Couldn't happen.
Unless, by some accident, I, uh I'd better recreate the incident.
Henbane, hemlock, jimsonweed.
With nasturtium And hickory seed.
All your strength Will be rebuilt.
And eliminate all of "gilt".
Great leaping lions of limbo, what have I done?
All your strength Will be rebuilt.
And eliminate all of gilt.
She got a reverse-the-curse spell by accident.
Now every time she hiccups, anything that's gilt will disappear.
The mirror disappeared.
It had a gold frame.
Exactly.
Where is she?
I don't know.
She went shopping.
Can you find her?
What's that?
It's an omnidirectional, three-dimensional, vectoring, cadmium-shielded computer for location analysis.
A what?
An omnidirectional, three-dimensional Never mind.
What does it do?
It tells you which witch went which way.
But until I find her, anything that's gilt will disappear when she hiccups.
I can't tell you how proud I am of Tabitha and Adam.
They're so well-behaved.
I must admit Darrin and I are very lucky.
You know, I'd love to show them off to some of my friends.
Couldn't I have them for just one weekend, alone?
Why, yes, of course.
Oh, good.
What about next weekend?
Well, next weekend I'm afraid Oh, then what about the weekend after?
Samantha?
Hm?
Oh, oh, uh, that would be fine.
Oh, good.
What's that?
It's a witch hunter, of course.
It's an invention of Dr. Bombay's.
It, uh, points out suspected liberals.
Do you mind?
You're standing right in the middle of the ectoplasmic vortex.
Oh.
Well, I just came out to announce a bucket of martinis.
Thank you.
I don't mind if I do.
Let me know if the arrow stops, or you'll go right to the bottom of my emergency list.
Oh, Samantha, look at this.
Ooh, that's pretty.
Oh, Samantha, wouldn't you love to have this?
I haven't worn out my old emerald yet.
Doing a little shopping, ladies?
Oh, run along, young man.
You're too young for me and too old for her.
Or should we call the store detective?
Oh, you're a cutie, you are.
You two kind of admired that necklace, didn't you?
What necklace?
It's gone.
All right.
Hand it over, grandma.
You think I took it?
One of you did.
Excellent.
I haven't had a drink as good as that since Thursday.
Thursday?
So am I. Let's have another drink.
Dr. Bombay?
The arrow stopped.
Ah, good.
Excuse me.
Mm.
Aha.
Now, this should only take a few minutes.
Now, then, we can save a lot of time if you'll just hand over the necklace quietly.
Officer, did you see either one of us take it?
It was there until you two passed by, and then it was gone.
Well, that doesn't mean we took it.
It just means it disappeared.
I guess I'll have to talk to you separately.
Don't touch me.
Don't give him anything but your name, rank and serial number.
Darrin.
What are you doing here?
That's what I'd like to know.
Must have got caught in my jet stream.
Sorry.
Sam, what's going on?
Well, for one thing, your mother the shoplifter is being grilled by a detective.
Dr. Bombay I know.
I had the wrong diagnosis.
The reason the bicycle and the tricycle appeared was to show you that your problem was not only logical, but "cycle" logical.
Dr. Bombay, can you reverse the spell?
Of course I can.
But you must stop feeling guilty about doing witchcraft.
Right elbow.
Henbane, hemlock Jimsonweed.
With nasturtium And hickory seed.
Reverse these things Which are neurotic.
With the broad-spectrum Anti-idiotic I'm all right again.
And put that back again.
And the things that disappeared earlier will pop back too.
I think I hear people in the outer office, but that's impossible.
Huh.
You think we took that necklace, and that's impossible too.
And now, if you don't mind, Samantha, I'd like to get back to my nurse.
We're going skin diving.
Thought we might sea horse around.
I'd better send you home.
Yeah.
Larry's there, probably going bananas.
Darrin?
This is your captain speaking.
Where are you?
Larry, where have you been?
Oh!
I've been looking all over for you, and I couldn't find you everywhere.
I think I'd better go home and take a nap.
Good idea.
Whoa!
You know what I think?
I think that necklace is right back where it was.
Lady, you're dealing with a professional detective And I think we ought to take another look just to make sure.
Are you sure you don't want me to drive you home?
Are you kidding?
I'm fine.
Before I go home and have a nap, I think I'll have one here first.
Ladies, I apologize.
I guess I've been on this job too long.
We understand.
Thank you, ladies.
Oh, but you're right.
It was there.
And then it wasn't there.
I saw it too.
I mean, I saw it not there.
Lady, let's not rub it in.
But Mrs. Stephens, that was mean telling him you saw the necklace wasn't there.
Well.
Well, for falsely accusing us, I think he deserved a little meanness.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Sam.
I dropped her off at her place.
She didn't feel like driving.
Why?
What happened at the department store?
Believe me, sweetheart, a good night's sleep, and she'll be back to normal.
Swell.
Where's Larry?
He went home.
But his car's still in the driveway.
He walked home.
After what he went through here, he didn't feel up to driving either.
Oh.
Well, look at it this way: We're helping to cut down on air pollution.
I thought I heard the dulcet tones of mortal bickering.
You cool, Sammy?
I'm fine.
Well, in that case, I think I'll cut out.
I have a date to play chess.
Since when have you taken up chess?
Since I found a set with real kings.
So long, Tall, Dark and Boring.
Serena, one of the things I like best about you is saying goodbye.
You sure like to kid around, don't you?
Well, suppose I make it even easier for you?
Serena!
Now he can kid around all he likes.
Ciao, Sammy.
Oh, sweetheart, you're right.
That was a rotten thing for Serena to do.
Oh.
Well, I can't do anything about her spells.
We'll just have to wait until she cools off and comes back.
Yes.
Huh?
Huh?
In the meantime?
Well, how would it be?
How would it be if I got you a little cart to pull?
Oh, sweetheart, watch your language.
What if the children heard you talk like that?
Oh, you do?
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
How about some coffee, sweetheart?
Swell.
Bring it in.
Uh-uh.
You've been at it all day.
Take a break.
Come on in the living room.
Hello, Samantha.
Oh, hi.
Hi there, Esmeralda.
Wherever you are.
Right here.
Boy, am I glad Larry's taking this material.
If there's one thing I don't need, it's Esmeralda.
Oh, dear.
Esmeralda, Mr. Stephens didn't mean that the way it sounded.
You're perfectly welcome here.
I am?
Yes.
And you can stay until Mr. Tate gets here.
When is he coming?
Any second.
You see?
He doesn't Doesn't  You really ought to do something about that cold.
It isn't a cold.
It's a sign of nervousness.
And it's involuntary, like the hiccups.
Well, I'm glad it's nothing serious.
You see?
Nothing I do lasts.
Even my failures are failures.
Let's face it, I'm a rotten witch.
Mm-hm.
Darrin, why don't you go finish your work?
Gladly.
Come on.
You, uh, seem a little upset.
Is anything wrong?
Everything.
Do you remember my old boyfriend, Ferdy?
Uh-huh.
Well, he wants to see me again.
But just wait until he finds out that my witchcraft is kaput.
Oh, I'm scared to death.
Why?
It's been over 400 years since I dated him, and, well, I've aged a little since then.
Nonsense, Esmeralda.
You don't look a century older.
Samantha, do you suppose you could do something to make me younger and more attractive?
What'd you have in mind?
A little plastic sorcery?
Huh?
Never mind.
Believe me, Esmeralda, there is nothing wrong with your looks.
Maybe.
But there's nothing right either.
Oh, well.
I don't have to see Ferdy again.
Even though it's probably my last chance to find happiness and have a home of my own.
I'll just struggle along somehow.
Maybe I should turn myself into something inanimate, like a plant.
Then all I'd have to do is sit in my pot and look pretty.
Now, Esmeralda Oh, I wouldn't mind.
Especially if you'd let me stay here.
I wouldn't get in the way.
And you'd only have to water me now and then.
I am not going to sit here and listen to any more nonsense.
If I was a cactus, you wouldn't have to water me at all.
Uh-oh.
That must be Larry.
Sam, if you don't mind Come on, Esmeralda.
Let's go upstairs and have a little witch-to-witch talk.
Hi, Larry.
How are you?
Terrible, thanks.
Louise has been hassling me all afternoon about What's that?
W-w-what's what?
Don't tell me you don't see the little elephant standing over there.
How little?
What?
Now it's gone.
That argument with Louise must have affected you more than you think.
Yeah.
Sam, what have you got for a headache?
Aw.
You have a headache?
No, but I'm expecting one any second.
Why are you doing that?
Because I am going to give you the works.
And I don't want you to look until I'm through.
I-I'm talking about the things that mortal women do to look their best.
Do you think mortal methods will work in my case?
It won't hurt.
These layouts are great.
I doubt if I'll have to be in Chicago more than a day.
Well, thanks.
I'll walk you to your car.
Who said I was leaving?
Oh.
After that blowup with Louise I packed my bag I'm going straight from here to the airport.
When's your plane?
Eight o'clock tonight.
What are you gonna do until then?
I thought I'd just hang around here, if it's all right with you.
Why not?
Just want Louise to know where I am in case she feels the need for another argument.
Busy.
Wouldn't you know it?
Why don't you go home and tell her?
Go home and tell her I'm here?
Sweetheart, can you tear yourself away for a second?
Sure.
Larry's gonna be here until his plane leaves tonight, so you'd better unload Esmeralda before she sneezes up another disaster.
I'm trying to do that.
How?
By improving her appearance.
I've given her a new hairdo, and I've done a lot of work on her makeup.
Oh.
How does she look?
Like Esmeralda with a new hairdo and makeup.
What she really needs is a shot of confidence.
Come on up and tell her how great she looks.
Anything to please you and get rid of her.
Don't forget to tell her how sensational she looks in the dress.
Okay, okay.
Oh, excuse me.
Oh, I'm sorry, Sam.
I didn't know you had company.
Uh.
How do you do?
I'm Darrin Stephens.
What's your name?
Oh, stop that.
Who do you remind me of?
I know.
Elizabeth Taylor.
No.
But that's close.
Oh, my goodness.
That hairdo is absolutely terrific.
That's enough.
And you look sensational in that dress.
This is a bathrobe.
But if you look that sensational in a bathrobe, you've really got it made.
That first dress was too tight.
But now I'm going to put the other one on.
And then can I look in the mirror?
Sure.
What was that about the mirror?
Well, I covered it and made her promise not to look until I was through.
Terrific.
What's gonna happen when she asks the mirror: "Who's the fairest one of all" and the mirror tells her?
I-I may have to give the mirror a little shot of confidence too.
Do whatever you want.
I better get back to Larry.
Why, I'm beautiful.
Is that really me?
Yes.
Hard to believe, isn't it?
I just can't get over the effect.
It's absolutely amazing.
Do you really like it?
I love it.
And you really didn't have to do too much, did you?
No, just a little touch here and there.
Oh.
I can't wait for Ferdy to see me.
And you're going to tell me she's not staying on that phone just to annoy me?
Larry, instead of staying around here and stewing, why don't we go to the range and hit a bucket of balls?
Are you kidding?
I played 18 holes this morning.
That's why Louise was upset.
She felt that since I was going away tonight, I ought to skip golf and spend the time with her.
How's that for an unreasonable demand?
What's unreasonable about it?
Why do you think I play golf?
For my health, right?
Does she care about my health?
Obviously not.
Darrin?
Excuse me.
What now?
I think I may have gone a little too far with Esmeralda.
In what way?
Judge for yourself.
There you are, you lovely man.
If he weren't yours, Samantha, I'd do my best to steal him.
Sam, are you sure all you gave her was a shot of confidence?
I told you I was going to punch up the mirrors.
Oh, before I forget, I just got in touch with Ferdy.
I'm meeting him in half an hour.
Oh, good.
That's the best news I've had all day.
Where are you meeting him?
Here, if it's okay.
What?
Here?
Something tells me it's not okay.
Esmeralda, let me put it this way: For once, you're absolutely right.
Sweetheart, don't upset her.
She'll go to pieces.
We can't let her entertain some weirdo while Larry's here.
Can't you get rid of him?
Only if I burn the house down.
Sweetheart, you have no idea how important this is to Esmeralda.
To put it in her own words, this may be her last chance to find a home of her own.
And if she does, she won't be around here so often.
I'll take another crack at Larry.
Oh, Larry, if you don't feel like hitting some golf balls, uh, how about going bowling?
I gave up bowling when I hurt my back, remember?
Oh, Sam Larry, you know Esmeralda, don't you?
Oh, sure.
How are you?
How nice to see you again.
How have you been?
Fine.
You're certainly looking very well.
Thanks.
You are too.
Oh, you're so sweet.
Isn't he sweet?
Very sweet.
I hope you're all having fun.
No, but would you like to?
Like to what?
Have some fun.
What?
Are you married?
Very.
Ha-ha.
I mean, yes.
Darrin, I-i-isn't it about time we left?
Where are we going?
What kind of a memory have you got?
You said you wanted to hit some golf balls or go bowling.
Anything.
Oh, right.
Goodbye, Sam.
Esmeralda.
Bye, Sam.
Esmeralda.
Well, Esmeralda, the coast is clear.
Everything's set.
Yes, except for one thing.
What's that?
My witchcraft.
What if I get nervous and sneeze up a rhinoceros or something?
Don't worry about it.
He'll be so dazzled by your beauty, he won't notice anything else.
Esmeralda, the stage is yours.
And have I got a terrible case of stage fright.
Well, so what if you've already finished a bucket of balls?
Buy another one.
No, you can't come home now.
Her boyfriend just arrived this second.
Well, call me in half an hour.
I'll tell you what's going on.
Goodbye.
Oh, Ferdy, it's such a joy to see you again after all these years.
How have you been?
Oh, fine.
Just fine.
We did have some gay, mad times, did we not?
You know something, Esmeralda?
You've changed.
Do you really think so?
Yes.
You're more, uh Oh, I don't know.
More poised and gayer.
You don't notice anything else?
What do you mean?
How about the way I look?
Well Well?
Can I fix you a drink?
Oh, yes, please.
Scotch on the rocks.
Scotch on the rocks, coming up.
Where are you going?
To make you a drink.
Make it?
Heh.
Well, why don't you just zap it up?
Why don't I just zap?
Why?
Oh, yeah.
Well, how silly of me.
Yes.
Scotch on the rocks, did you say?
Oh, Esmeralda.
Oh, that is hilarious.
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, she has a terrific sense of humour, hasn't she?
Definitely.
Oh, Esmeralda, you are priceless.
Oh.
Oh.
Oh, well, that's a Scotchman for you.
You mentioned "priceless," a-and he lost interest.
Ha-ha!
Oh, that's too much.
And now, Esmeralda, I really could use that drink.
Well, here you are.
Thank you.
Mmm.
You mind if I smoke?
Well, if you'll excuse me, I really have to get dinner started.
I cook by mortal methods.
Oh, really?
Isn't that kind of messy?
Yes, but it's more fun.
Samantha, there's something I have to ask you.
I'll be right back, Ferdy.
Okay if I go now, Uncle Ferdy?
Are you mad?
Of course not.
Now, you promised to stand by and protect me.
You realise I almost missed lighting that cigar.
How come?
You had your back to me.
You better watch it.
No, you watch it.
Or else this reunion is gonna turn into a disaster.
What's the difference?
Sooner or later she'll find out your witchcraft is shot.
It is not shot.
It just needs a little assist.
The situation really isn't as bad as it seems.
Usually, when you get nervous, you sneeze or fade out, and you haven't done either.
That's only because I'm too scared to be nervous.
Samantha, I will not go back in there again unless you promise to keep helping me.
Please.
All right, all right.
Samantha, how come Ferdy hasn't noticed how different I look?
Uh, well, that's because when you look into the mirror, you see the image that you project.
And when that happens, your reflection casts back your inner glow, and your charisma comes to the fore.
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, isn't it?
Isn't it?
Yes.
Do you understand?
No.
Well, y-you just go on acting beautiful and feeling beautiful, and I'll take care of the rest.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
Oh, Esmeralda, I just realized how neglectful I've been.
Why, I completely forgot to bring you flowers.
Now, let me see.
As I remember, uh, roses were your favourite.
Oh.
What's wrong?
Oh.
Oh, nothing.
After all, what are roses without thorns?
Oh.
I think I'll join you in that drink.
Well, you better get one of your own, because I don't think we can both fit into this one.
I think I'll have a margarita.
Hey, Mac.
What are you doing there?
What is it?
Uh, nothing.
Not a thing.
Let's drive down to Mulvaney's Bar.
We didn't get a call to go there.
Maybe you didn't, but I just did.
Hello?
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
No, I-I, uh, I can't talk too long.
Because the extension cord's not long enough.
Sam, I don't know what you're talking about, and I know better than to ask.
Would you care for something to eat?
Oh, that would be nice.
How about some, uh, smoked salmon, huh?
One smoked salmon, coming up.
Oh, dear.
Darrin, I cannot leave Esmeralda unattended like this.
Samantha, don't you dare hang up.
Oh, I don't know how that could've Could've  Gesundheit.
Gesundheit.
Oh.
Oh, Ferdy, there's something I've got to tell you.
Oh, dear.
Samantha's pearls.
Ferdy, I am so nervous.
Would you put them back the way they were?
Oh, why, of course, my dear.
Pearls, back the way you were.
Oysters?
Oh, Ferdy, I didn't mean to go that far back.
Esmeralda, now that you've brought it up, there's something I have to tell you too.
Darrin, I have got to go, or Esmeralda's gonna be in a lot of trouble.
Sam, Larry's insisting we go back to the house.
He wants to pick up the portfolio and get to the airport.
Uh-oh.
Where'd he go?
Uh, the fella you came with?
Uh, he said he was tired of waiting and he would see you at your house.
He flagged a cab.
What?
Oh, thanks.
Sam, Larry's on his way over there right now.
Get those two oddballs out of there, quick.
Aye, aye, sir.
Oh, E-Esmeralda, I'm sorry to Oh, Samantha, wait till you hear this.
Ferdy's powers aren't in any better shape than mine.
Oh, which reminds me, here are your pearls back.
I'm afraid that was my doing.
I tell you, I was a nervous wreck for fear that she'd find out, but as it turned out, she's a wreck too.
What a relief.
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm glad.
Now, I hope you two won't misunderstand, but Congratulate us.
We're engaged.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Now, what can I give you for a present?
I know, a trip.
Starting right now.
Well, goodbye and good luck.
Samantha, wait.
Well, I-I can't.
B-but what is it?
There are a few things in the living room we couldn't get rid of.
What kind of things?
Well, two seals.
And a smoking salmon.
Oh, my stars.
I don't see anything.
Well, they're gone.
That's one advantage of being a failure.
Larry, wait.
Would you like me to work on your pearls?
Oh, no.
Uh, never mind.
But you simply must go now.
Would you like me to give you a little booster shot?
Thanks, but together, I think we can make it.
What was that?
Hi, sweetheart.
What was what?
There were two people standing there.
Esmeralda and a man.
Then they faded away.
Oh, Larry.
You need a rest.
You and Louise should take a little vacation.
You mean from each other?
That's a perfect example of why this is happening to you.
It is.
It's a perfect example.
In what way?
In what way?
It's your whole attitude toward Louise.
When you don't respect someone, when you treat them as if they don't exist, they just disappear from your consciousness.
They They fade away.
Follow me?
No.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Louise.
Yes, he's here.
Oh, you don't say.
Uh, Larry, it's Louise.
I wonder how Miss AT&T managed to squeeze me into her schedule.
What Louise just told me is gonna make you feel pretty foolish.
The line's been out of order all day.
Sure, with the way she stays glued to the phone.
If I were you, I'd take her to Chicago with me.
You're right.
And I will.
Hello, teddy bear.
What do you mean, where have I been all day?
Most of it I've spent trying to call you.
But never mind that.
How would you like to pack your toothbrush and your chin strap and come to Chicago?
Honey, I was just kidding.
What are you getting so uptight about?
Sam and Darrin know you don't use a chin strap.
It was a joke.
All right, so you don't think it's funny.
How about going to Chicago?
What kind of an attitude is that?
She refuses to go.
I am not persecuting you.
It's all in your imagination.
But But But
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
What got you up so early?
A very unhappy client, who's coming in this morning for the express purpose of blowing his top.
Oh?
I have a feeling, unless I come up with a brainstorm, McMann & Tate is about to part company with Mount Rocky Mutual Insurance.
And the feeling won't be mutual, right?
Sam, it's too early for that.
What would you like for breakfast?
If you've got any brain food, I could sure use it.
Oh.
While you're here, what do you think of this layout for Mount Rocky?
"Insure with Mount Rocky and guarantee a future that isn't".
Guarantee a future that isn't rocky.
I'll see what I have in the way of brain food.
I'll pass up my three guesses.
What is this all about?
If it was anyone but you, Durwood, it would be obvious.
I was playing sand polo in the Sahara.
How do you play polo from a camel's back with such a short mallet?
Tall ball.
Ha-ha-ha.
Samantha, will you kindly get this beast out of here?
And the camel too.
I don't say you have no sense of humor, but the one you have is sadly in need of replacement.
Endora, first of all, I never laugh when I see something tragic.
And secondly, while a living room may be a funny place for a camel, it's not so funny when it's our living room.
And thirdly, if Sweetheart, why not just leave it at "secondly"?
Okay.
And I hope you won't misunderstand if I skip breakfast.
It's just that, when your mother arrived, my appetite left.
Face it, Samantha.
That man simply has no sense of humor.
Just because he doesn't find you amusing?
Does a turkey laugh at an ax?
Half of that comparison is revolting.
What is revolting is your treatment of Darrin.
It is unforgivable, detestable and inhuman.
Thank you, my darling.
You've made my day.
What's the use?
Oh!
Betty, be sure and notify me just as soon as Mount Rocky I mean, Mr. Jameson.
Arrives.
We simply must do something about your abysmal sense of humor.
It isn't fair for my daughter to be saddled with such a glum-dum.
To avoid the shock Of sudden wit.
We'll start from scratch, Bit by bit.
A chime will cause Your brain to whirl.
Your jokes will cause Their hair to curl.
Ah, Mr. Jameson just arrived.
He's in with Mr. Tate.
Oh, and your wife said to tell you she'd be out shopping for a while.
My wife?
When did she?
Speaking of wives, you know why they call them the better half, don't you?
When they ask you for shopping money, you'd better have it.
That's what a wife is: Someone to spend with the rest of your life.
But a wife is a great comfort.
When you've got all the kind of troubles you never had as a bachelor.
Ha-ha-ha.
If you're wondering who to blame this on, uh, w-w-we were watching a comic on television last night.
And, uh, my mother-in-law insisted  My mother-in-law has one terrible habit: Breathing.
Mr. Stephens, what's gotten into you?
My mother-in-law.
Yes?
Yes, he is.
It's Mr. Tate.
He sounds mad.
Tell him Tell him I'm not here.
I just told him you were.
Oh.
Uh, hi, Larry.
What's up?
What's up?
You are.
Look, uh, Larry, I'm not feeling too well.
I was wondering if it wouldn't be wiser for you to carry on alone.
Let me put it this way: No.
I'll give you 30 seconds to get in here.
Personally, I think you're making a mistake keeping Stephens on my account.
He's too flighty.
Insurance is a serious business.
You think Stephens isn't serious?
I don't have a man in the place who takes his job more seriously.
Ah.
Sorry I'm late.
Well, how are you, Mr. Jameson?
Well, aside from my bursitis, which is killing me, not so good.
Can I get you anything?
Uh, a drink of water to wash these down.
Drink.
Speaking of drinking, I know a guy who can really drink.
He comes back from lunch so loaded, they make him use the freight elevator.
If there's a nip in the air, he even tries to drink that.
Mm.
Ah.
Just a few jokes to lighten the occasion.
Boy, have you got the wrong occasion.
Water, Tate, quick.
Darrin, when was the last time your doctor gave you a checkup?
I Not too long ago.
What about your psychiatrist?
Psychiatrist?
Anyone who goes to a psychiatrist ought to have his head examined.
You were right, Darrin.
You're sick.
Take the rest of the day off.
Two friends meet at a psychiatrist's.
One asks, "Are you coming or going"?
The other one says And the other one says, "If I knew that, I wouldn't be here".
That was either an earthquake or Darrin.
Sam!
Or both.
Hi, sweetheart.
What's wrong?
Your mother.
Oh, dear.
Did she do something mean?
Mean?
Your mother is so mean, she has a testimonial award from Attila the Hun.
If you were drowning, she'd throw you the whole rope.
Are you beginning to get the picture?
Mother!
This is, without a doubt, one of the meanest things you've ever done to him.
Hello?
Oh, hi, Larry.
Oh?
He left the office?
He hasn't come home yet, huh?
W-Well, we had a little misunderstanding earlier.
I'm sure he'll tell you about it.
I'm sure he will.
Tell Darrin I've been saving his neck with Jameson.
I ad-libbed his ideas, and by some miracle, the client is still interested.
But I need Darrin's layouts, and he took them with him.
Tell him he's to bring them right back to the office.
Right back.
Got it.
Bye-bye.
Sam, what am I gonna do?
I can't go back to the office with this This affliction.
I'll tell you one thing.
Your mother is going to pay for this.
I was only trying to give him a sense of humor and make things a little more pleasant around here.
And that is the truth.
Just take the spell off him.
Oh, all right.
There.
Thank you, Mother.
Endora, someday you're going to go too far, and it won't be soon enough for me.
Darrin.
Oh, Sam, call Larry and tell him I'm just leaving.
And, Endora, if you don't stay out of my life, I'm going to call in an exterminator.
Life isn't just one big joke.
Perhaps not.
But he is.
Ooh!
Ugh!
Ooh, you're driving me out of my tree.
Your view of life I find quite sick.
This spell will change What makes you tick.
At serious things You'll laugh and giggle.
The graver the note The more it will tickle    Uh, hi, Mr. Stephens.
Oh, hello, Mrs. Kravitz.
How are things?
Oh, just heard from my sister, the one in St. Louis, she's gonna have an operation.
An operation?
What's so funny?
It's just Just, ahem, something I thought of.
What's the matter with you?
Believe me, I'm not laughing at you.
I'm laughing at myself.
Ha-ha-ha.
Uh.
Excuse me, there's something I forgot in the house.
Larry, I-I told you, he left a few minutes ago.
He should be there soon.
Unless he gets held up.
Goodbye.
Sweetheart, what's wrong?
She did it to me again.
Mother?
What'd she do now?
She's fixed it so that when I hear something sad, I laugh.
Oh, that's awful.
Oh, you poor thing.
Oh.
Oh, Darrin Sam, please, stop.
Don't say anything serious.
Just call Larry back and stall him.
Now, I'm going in the den, and close the door so I won't be able to hear anything.
And if I'm lucky, I won't be able to think either.
N Sam, if you love me, don't talk to me.
Yes?
Put her on.
It's Stephens' wife.
What's happening, Sam?
Came back home?
Why?
Well, uh, Larry, he was feeling a little bit under the weather and  What?
!
Larry, you're screaming.
If you were in my position, so would you.
Let me ask you something, Sam, how sick is he?
Well, he really isn't well at all.
That makes two of us.
Well, okay, Sam, goodbye.
Stephens is very sick.
That makes three of us.
I think I'll go back to the hotel, pick up Mrs. Jameson and take an earlier plane out.
You can't do that.
I beg your pardon?
I-I mean, you made the trip out from Denver.
It would be such a waste if you didn't at least Why don't I drive you and Mrs. Jameson to the airport?
Stephens' house is on the way.
We can stop, I'll show you his layouts.
I thought you said he was sick.
Yes.
But I don't think he's unconscious.
Mother?
Mother, I'm sure you're here, because I know how much you love your work.
Haven't you had enough fun?
"No.
And give my regards to laughing boy".
Oh, Mother, you're absolutely heartless.
"Flatterer".
Oh.
Sam?
Don't say a word.
Just, uh, shake your head.
Do you have anything to report?
Did you contact your mother?
Is she gonna do anything about this?
I could have answered that myself.
It's Mrs. Kravitz.
I'd better clear out.
With her bad news, she'd keep me in stitches.
Hi, Mrs. Kravitz.
Hi.
Where's your cup?
Cup?
Don't you wanna borrow some sugar?
Oh, no.
I just stopped by to ask, how's Mr. Stephens?
I saw him before, and he acted very, very strange.
He just kept laughing and laughing.
Well, you know, they say that laughter is a sign of health.
Only if there's something to laugh at.
If you need the name of a good psychiatrist, I have one.
I'm sure you do.
Well, I'd better be running along.
Sam, I've been thinking.
With all these new countries emerging in Africa, maybe it'd be a good place to start an advertising agency.
The weather's mild, and Oh, Mrs. Stephens.
I I forgot something.
Yes, Mrs. Kravitz?
I just remembered.
I could use that cup of sugar after all.
One cup of sugar, coming up.
Incidentally, did you hear about the accident over on Elm last night?
It was a four-car crack-up.
No.
What's that?
What's what?
That.
I don't know.
Mice, maybe.
Mice?
And, Mrs. Kravitz, if you wanna be a good neighbor, you won't tell a soul.
Oh, you know me.
Uh.
W-What about your sugar?
What about it?
Oh, that.
Oh, well, if you don't mind, I'll be back later.
Oh, hi.
Hello.
Oh, Mrs. Fremont!
Oh, hi, Sam.
Hi, Larry.
What are you doing here?
I'm driving the Jamesons to the airport, and I wanted to stop by and get Darrin's layout.
Mr. and Mrs. Jameson, Mrs. Stephens.
SAMANTHA &  How do you do?
Unh!
Ow!
What was that?
Darrin!
What happened?
Ah.
I was just resting.
Well, how are you, Mr. Jameson?
I'm sorry we've been having so much trouble getting together.
Uh, Darrin, this is Mrs. Jameson.
Darrin Stephens, one of my young geniuses.
Erratic, but talented.
How do you do, Mrs. Jameson?
Well, have you been enjoying your stay in town?
Not especially.
I have a miserable migraine.
Oh, that's a shame.
Well, I'm glad you think my migraine's funny.
I don't know what he's got, but I hope it isn't contagious.
Now, don't get too close, Martha, he's sick.
Oh, my.
Ha-ha.
Did you two eat anything for lunch, or did you just drink it?
I'm sorry, Larry, but that neighbor lady that just left, well, she is such a terrible gossip.
And I said to Darrin: "She certainly has a keen sense of rumor".
Yeah, yeah.
She's on spiking terms with everybody.
That is funny.
Well, I guess it is contagious.
Tate, what are we waiting for?
Darrin?
The layouts.
Uh, right.
Please, come in and sit down.
Well, just for a minute.
Tate, we're thinking of starting a whole new line of coverage this year.
Pollution insurance.
Yes, that's very interesting.
Insure people against damage from smog, water pollution, oil spillage  Don't tell me you think pollution is funny too?
No.
No, on the contrary, I think it's deadly serious.
Are you putting us on?
Oh, Larry.
Larry, you guessed it.
Darrin was actually trying to drive home a point, right?
Right.
I guess I made a wrong turn.
Oh.
Ha.
Well, the point I've been trying to get across is Well, see these layouts?
Hm?
Darrin, what are you doing?
I'm throwing out the old and bringing in the new.
Mr. Jameson, I-I feel that Mount Rocky's approach to the public is a little too serious.
Insurance is a business that deals in catastrophe and disaster.
You may ask, why am I laughing?
I'll bite.
Darrin's idea is to use laughter as a form of release.
Now, we all know that laughter is a sign of health.
Mr. Jameson, I don't want you to miss your plane.
Just a minute, let's hear him out.
Yes, Darrin, let's hear you out.
What have you got in mind specifically, Stephens?
Well, uh, specifically I'm not prepared to Oh, Darrin.
Hm?
Don't be so modest.
I think he had a terrific idea for a slogan.
What's that, Darrin?
What's that, Sam?
"Put a little laughter in your disaster".
That is very funny.
Is that sensational?
Do you think so?
What do you think?
Keep going, Stephens.
Keep going, Stephens.
Well, here's another one I've been kicking around.
Uh "Keep your mother-in-law at home, where most accidents happen".
That's funny.
Oh, Harold.
Stop being such a wet blanket.
If you'd learn to laugh a little, it might help your bursitis.
And even if it didn't help, it certainly wouldn't hurt.
And besides, I'm sick of hearing you complain about your bursitis.
What about you and your migraine?
Where do you think I get my migraine?
Oh, that's cute.
Oh, that reminds me of an uncle of mine who's always complaining.
When he gets up, the first thing he says is, "Good moaning".
Mrs. Stephens, that's very funny.
Ha-ha.
Her uncle has such a long face, his barber charges him double for a shave.
Oh, that's so funny.
I worked for a grouch like that once.
Before he'd fire you, he'd give you a raise so you'd be losing a better job.
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, Larry  Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
My bursitis is gone.
Oh, that's wonderful, Mr. Jameson.
Laugh and the world laughs with you.
Mrs. Stephens?
Yeah.
Oh, thank you.
And this.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
Bye-bye.
Who's that from?
Wait a second.
Let me look.
"Thank you for a most rewarding afternoon.
Mr. and Mrs. Jameson".
Hm.
Seems to be for me.
"So you'll never forget the health-giving quality of laughter".
"Put me down for a laugh".
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
That was very good, that last one.
Yeah.
Mommy, "What is grey, has big ears a long trunk, and weighs only three pounds"?
I don't know.
What is grey, has big ears, a long trunk and weighs only three pounds?
"A very, very, very thin elephant".
Heh-heh!
You got me there, partner.
Now, what kind of a table has no legs?
A timetable.
Oh  Grandma's here.
Grandma.
Okay, sweetie, here we go.
We're gonna see Grandma, huh?
How is my little angel?
Fine.
Ah, and where is Mommy?
Hi, Mrs. Stephens.
Oh, there you are, Samantha.
Oh, and there he is.
Guess what Grandma has brought for her precious.
Oh, what is that?
And this is for the littlest princess.
Oh, Mrs. Stephens.
I think it's a top.
You don't have to bring them something every time you come.
Well, if I were here as often as your mother, you'd probably be right.
Oh, look.
What is that?
Oh, it's a top.
Oh, look, Mommy.
Thank you, Grandma.
Oh, it's beautiful.
Why, I haven't seen one of those since I It must be very old.
Oh, yes.
Yes, it was given to me by my grandmother.
Well, Tabitha, you take very good care of that.
It's a real antique.
Wow, it must be a thousand years old.
Not quite.
But you're close.
You know, Darrin stopped by the house last week, and I thought he looked awfully thin.
Well, I-I hope you told him.
He's been trying to lose a few pounds.
Oh, Tabitha, I'm surprised at you.
Now, you're old enough to share.
But it's an antique, and he might break it.
Well, he can play with it if he promises to be very, very careful.
Promise, Adam?
All right, sweetheart.
Let him play with it for a little while.
I hope you don't misunderstand, Samantha.
I'm sure you do your best to cook the things that Darrin likes.
But perhaps I'd better give you the recipes for some of the favorite dishes of his.
What?
What was that?
What do you mean?
The The doll.
It floated through the air from Adam right over to Tabitha.
Yes.
Weird, isn't it?
Uh, Tabitha, I think the only thing to do Excuse me.
Is put this away until you two have learned how to share.
Now, why don't you and Adam go out in the back and play for a while?
Okay.
Come on, Adam, let's go outside and share.
Come on, sweetie.
Come on.
There you go.
Take the top outside.
That's good.
Well, how about a cup of coffee?
I have some in the kitchen.
Oh, never mind the coffee.
What about the doll?
You mean, you noticed it too?
Huh?
Mrs. Stephens, you were right about that doll.
I-it did fly across the room.
Did it ever occur to you that you might have been the one who moved it?
Me?
Of course.
It's a question of mind over matter.
Mrs. Stephens, isn't it true that you were worried about Adam playing with your grandmother's doll that he might damage it?
Yes.
It's simple.
Your subconscious willed that the doll be in the hands of Tabitha where it would be safe.
Come.
What are you doing?
I'm testing my powers, what do you think?
Come.
I did it.
There's no doubt about it, I do have the power.
But why is it I've never been aware of it?
Well, uh, from what little I-I've read, supernatural powers have a tendency to come and go.
Mostly go.
This will probably never happen again.
Oh, no.
No.
And I know where my powers come from.
My grandmother, the one who gave me this doll, people said she had unusual powers.
Really?
You know, this could come in very handy.
At my Tuesday night bridge club, for example.
M-Mrs. Stephens, I swear I will not tell a soul about this, a-a-and I assume you won't either.
Why not?
Well, I-I-I don't know too much about it, but, uh, it seems to me that people shouldn't fool around with the unknown.
And I certainly wouldn't tell anybody about this.
Most people are disbelievers, and they'd just think that you're Screwy?
Samantha, you must promise me never to tell a soul about this.
Where the devil have you been?
Funny you should mention the devil.
Phyllis, do you mind telling me where you've been all day?
I've been to the library, studying.
I didn't think you even knew where it was.
What are you studying?
Oh, nothing.
Phyllis, if you've got something to say, say it.
My lips are sealed.
Good.
I'm gonna mix myself a drink.
Oh, wait.
Wait, Frank, I-I have something to tell you.
What is it?
Oh, Frank, I found out something about myself today.
Yeah?
I have supernatural powers.
What do you mean, supernatural?
What do you think I mean by supernatural?
Well, I think that it means things that aren't natural.
But that's not what you mean, is it?
That's exactly what I mean.
Good grief.
I'm gonna call Dr. Rhinehouse.
You've wigged out.
Oh, really?
Would you like a demonstration?
I will that hourglass to fly off that shelf and over to my beloved husband.
Go.
You're right, let's go, to see Dr. Rhinehouse.
You go see Dr. Rhinehouse.
I'm gonna find out what's happened to my power.
Wherever you go, I'm going with you.
Hi, sweetheart.
H-how was your game?
Great.
But it'll improve.
How did it go with my mother today?
We had a very interesting visit.
Well, what do you mean, "interesting"?
Well, uh, wh-why don't you let me fix you a drink and then I'll tell you all about it?
I have a feeling this is gonna be a two-drink story.
Well Uh, you answer that, I'll get your drink.
Oh, hi Samantha, I've got to talk to you, privately.
Mother, aren't you even gonna say hello to me?
Honey, it's Darrin.
Our son?
Oh, I'm so sorry, dear.
How was your golf game?
Terrible, thanks.
Well, don't be surprised if it improves.
Come, Samantha.
You know what this is all about?
Your mother has some weird idea that she has supernatural powers.
Is that right?
Darrin, what am I gonna do?
Well, the first thing to do is have a drink.
I'll meet you in the den.
As I told you before, these things have a tendency to come and go.
Mostly go.
Yours are gone.
Hee-hee!
Samantha, if you'll forgive me, this is one subject you know nothing about.
This is a private conversation.
I just came in to get Out.
Yes, ma'am.
Now, what was I saying?
Oh, yes.
Now, I've been at the, uh, library studying supernatural powers all day, and I found out why my powers worked here and not in my house.
You did?
Why?
Do you know what a familiar is?
A what?
Well, I see I'll have to start with fundamentals.
According to my research, a familiar is an animal or an object which acts as a transmitter, so to speak, for a person who has the power.
Do you follow me?
Vaguely.
Naturally, it's hard for a person like yourself to understand.
But the point is that somewhere in this house is my familiar.
Mrs. Stephens Oh, please, Samantha.
Take my word for it.
Now, let's see.
It could be anything.
A pot, an eggbeater, a picture.
That's it.
That's my familiar.
My grandmother's doll.
Of course.
Should I go up to my room?
That's a nice, safe place.
I'll be up in a minute.
Tell Tabitha not to worry about the doll.
I'll get her another one.
Another one?
Well, of course.
You don't think I'm gonna give this one up, do you?
She's regressing.
I've gotta get her to a doctor.
No, Dad, wait.
I wouldn't do anything to, uh, provoke her right now.
You know what I mean?
Oh, she might flip altogether?
It's better to humor her.
Well, darling, I see you've got your doll back.
For your information, this isn't just a doll.
It isn't?
Oh, of course it isn't.
What is it?
It's my familiar.
Well, it should be familiar, you've had it since you were a child.
Oh, Frank, stop humoring me.
I'm as sane as anybody in this room, and I'll prove it to you.
Come to me.
I said, come to me.
I know what's wrong.
There are negative vibrations in this room sent out by disbelievers.
And I think he knows who he is.
I'm going to look this up in my books.
Phyllis, wait.
Don't you think it'd be a better idea if we went home?
I'm not going home with any disbeliever, you old goat.
That's it.
That's what?
The answer.
What was the question?
I'll tell you later.
What your mother needs is a good dose of hyper-hallucinogenic revelation.
What?
I'm gonna scare the daylights out of her.
If you don't mind your father being changed into a goat for a few hours.
Moony, cheeny.
Toony, greeny  Are you having any luck?
No.
No, I just tried this incantation, but nothing happened.
I'll find another spell.
I guess the reason my powers are so erratic is because   I did it again.
Oh, Frank.
Frank, come here, quick.
You think you're so smart.
Come and see something.
I had the doll up in the air.
Sure.
Sure.
Why won't you believe me?
Why?
Why?
Because I'll tell you why.
Because you're as stubborn as a mule.
Sam.
Well, how did I know she was gonna switch to a mule?
Good heavens.
What?
How?
I mean, did I do that?
Well, you must have.
It was a subconscious wish.
Just like this morning, when you willed that doll from Adam.
Oh, Frank, it was an accident.
Frank, I'm so sorry.
He's angry with me.
Do you blame him?
Uh, I think you'd better try and undo whatever it is you did.
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Undo the spell.
Now, look here.
I-I want that spell undone this minute.
Do you hear?
Oh, Frank, will you ever forgive me?
Samantha, I have come to a decision.
What's that, Mrs. Stephens?
Never again, as long as I live, no matter what the temptation, no matter what the circumstances, irregardless of how I feel Go ahead, Mother.
I will never again use the phrase "stubborn mule" to your poor father.
From now on, I'm gonna have to be very careful what I say, or think, for that matter.
People with my power have to learn to discipline their thoughts.
Uh, Mrs. Stephens, I-I have what I think is a logical suggestion.
Now, if you got the power from your grandmother, why not ask her to solve this problem?
Sort of go to the source of the sorcery, so to speak.
How can I ask her?
Well, there must be something in all those books of yours on On how to contact the spirit world.
Oh, you mean a sÃ©ance?
Whatever it's called.
That's a marvelous idea.
I'll go right in and look up how it's done.
Frank, get out of my way.
Now Now, you sit there, Samantha, and, Darrin, you're over here.
Frank, you're fine where you are.
Now, let's all join hands.
All right.
Clear your minds, everybody.
Oh, Grandma, I call to your spirit from the vasty deep.
Oh, hear me.
Hear me.
Hear me.
Was that her?
No, that was Frank.
Keep trying.
I beseech you, Grandma, to come to me from your great spirit world.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Come to me.
Mother, look.
Good heavens.
What's that?
It's your grandmother.
It doesn't look like her.
Well, that's her spirit, not her body.
Oh, of course, what's the matter with me?
How are you, Grandma?
Just fine, Phyllis, dear.
How are you?
Grandma, what happened to your Irish brogue?
Sure and begorra, I've still got it, me darlin'.
Now, if you don't mind me askin', Phyllis, what are you callin' me about?
Oh, Grandma, a terrible thing has happened.
I turned Frank into a mule, and now I can't turn him back.
Fay, 'tis is a sorry sight to see.
'Twas my hope you'd never discover the family curse but you have, worse luck.
Family curse?
Aye, that it is.
And many the soul it's brought to grief.
If you know what's good for you, you'll give it up and ne'er try it again.
Oh, I will, Grandma.
I swear.
I promise.
Fine.
Now, I've got to be on me way.
Goodbye to you all.
Oh, oh, wait, Grandma, you didn't tell me how to turn Frank back.
You'll have to find out for yourself.
I swore I'd never use me powers again.
But if you swear never to use your powers again Oh, I swear.
I swear.
All right.
I'll give you a bit of a hint.
It's a common word in everyday use.
The secret word is "love".
Love.
Love.
I don't understand.
What does she mean?
Oh, Grandma, come back.
Can't you give me another hint?
Mrs. Stephens, I think I know what your grandmother meant.
You do?
What?
What?
She meant that there is no power greater than the power of love.
Maybe that'll do the trick.
Love?
Yes.
So maybe if you told Dad how much you love him, it would help.
You think so?
It wouldn't hurt.
I'll try it.
I'll try anything.
Frank.
Frank, I love you.
You know that, don't you?
I know that sometimes I'm very unfair to you, and I say things I don't mean.
And I admit I'm very quick-tempered and not very understanding.
But underneath it all, you know you mean everything in the world to me.
Phyllis.
Oh, Frank.
Yes, I'll do that.
Goodbye, Mom.
Hello from my mother.
You know, it's really incredible.
They've been carrying on like kids all week.
Sunday, they went bike riding, bowling last night.
And guess what they're doing tonight.
Splitting a tank of oxygen?
Sorry.
What are they doing?
They're going to a rock concert to hear Freddy and the Furry Freaks.
That's terrific.
It just proves what I've always maintained: Nothing beats a simple statement of love.
Even when it's brought about by witchcraft?
Even then.
And as far as I'm concerned, it couldn't happen to the parents of a nicer person.
Speaking of nice things reminds me of your mother.
Really?
I was just thinking how nice it is that we haven't seen her in over two weeks.
Oh, now, Darrin, don't tempt fate.
You never know when she might be She was.
His mother was a fool.
His father was a mule.
From this you may deduce.
Their offspring is a goose   Oh, oh Oh, oh, Mother, how could you?
"Easy".
Oh.
Oh, sweetheart, I am sorry.
But I did warn you.
Darrin, you be careful what you say.
Mother speaks perfect goose.
Oh, Darrin, calm down.
You know very well that Mother will be along any minute to change you back.
I'll, uh, tell you what I'll do, just to keep you happy till Mother arrives.
