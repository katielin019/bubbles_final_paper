{START OF EPISODE 01}
THIS IS WASHINGTON, D.C. SOMEWHERE IN THIS CITY IS THE HEADQUARTERS OF A TOP SECRET ORGANIZATION KNOWN AS CONTROL.
ITS BUSINESS IS COUNTERESPIONAGE.
THIS IS SYMPHONY HALL IN WASHINGTON.
SOMEWHERE IN THIS AUDIENCE IS ONE OF CONTROL'S TOP EMPLOYEES, A MAN WHO LIVES A LIFE OF DANGER AND INTRIGUE, A MAN WHO'S BEEN CAREFULLY TRAINED NEVER TO DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT HE IS A SECRET AGENT.
THIS IS  MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86.
HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX.
WHAT'S UP?
KAOS, EH?
YES, SIR.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.
UH, I MAY BE A FEW MINUTES LATE, CHIEF.
- HELLO, MAX.
- HI, CHIEF.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, CHIEF.
WELL, CHIEF, WHAT'S ALL THE EXCITEMENT ABOUT?
MAX, THIS IS A BIG ONE.
THE FATE OF OUR ENTIRE NATION MAY DEPEND ON IT.
AS YOU KNOW, HERE AT CONTROL IT'S POLICY TO ASSIGN CASES IN ROTATION.
WELL, IT'S YOUR TURN AT BAT.
RIGHT.
OH, I'M SORRY.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, SIR.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M RARING TO GO.
MAX, LET ME GIVE YOU A QUICK BRIEFING.
FIRST OF ALL, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
I BELIEVE IT'S A PHOTOGRAPH.
IT'S A MACHINE CALLED THE INTHERMO, AND IT'S CAPABLE OF CONVERTING HEAT WAVES INTO IMMENSE DESTRUCTIVE POWER.
NOW, MAX, IT'S BEEN STOLEN AND ITS INVENTOR, PROFESSOR HUGO DANTE, KIDNAPPED FROM HIS LONG ISLAND LABORATORY.
SOUNDS LIKE THE KAOS ORGANIZATION - IS BACK IN ACTION, CHIEF.
- RIGHT.
AND THEIR MR.
BIG, WHOEVER HE IS, HAS BROADCAST A DEMAND FOR $100 MILLION RANSOM OR HE'LL USE THE INTHERMO AGAINST OUR CITIES.
MR.
BIG MUST BE STOPPED BEFORE HE GOES ANY FURTHER - AND, MAX, IT SEEMS TO ME-- - JUST A MINUTE, CHIEF.
- ISN'T THIS TOP SECURITY?
- YES.
WELL, SHOULDN'T WE ACTIVATE THE CONE OF SILENCE?
THE CONE OF SILENCE?
- YES.
- ALL RIGHT, MAX.
- HODGKINS.
- Yes, sir.
ACTIVATE THE CONE OF SILENCE.
The cone of silence?
FIRST OF ALL, HOW MUCH-- HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT KAOS?
WHAT DID YOU SAY, SIR?
- KAOS.
- WHAT?
KAOS.
OH, KAOS.
YES, OF COURSE.
WELL THAT'S AN INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION THAT WAS FOUNDED OH, I THINK, IN 1957.
HOW'S THAT?
- '57.
- WHAT?
'57!
AGENT 57 IS IN HONG KONG.
- WHAT?
- HONG KONG.
WHAT ABOUT HONG KONG?
WHAT?
HONG KONG!
WHY ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HONG KONG?
- WHAT?
- HONG-- HODGKINS, RAISE THE CONE OF SILENCE.
- What?
- RAISE THE CONE OF SILENCE!
PERHAPS WE COULD JUST TALK SOFTLY, SIR.
MAX, LET'S GET YOU SET UP WITH SOME SPECIAL EQUIPMENT.
WOULD YOU PLEASE?
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL NEED?
WELL, CHIEF, THIS LOOKS LIKE A HEAVY CASE, BUT I THINK I'LL JUST TAKE THE BARE NECESSITIES-- MY BINO-SPECS, MY LOCKER KEY AND MY BERETTA.
MAX, TAKE THE INFLATO-COAT WITH YOU.
OH, CHIEF, IT'S THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER.
BESIDES, THAT'S NOT EVEN MY SIZE.
HODGKINS WILL ISSUE ONE IN YOUR SIZE.
I WANT YOU TO HAVE ONE WITH YOU.
WELL, OKAY, CHIEF, IF YOU SAY SO.
ANYTHING ELSE?
WELL, I THINK I'D LIKE TO TAKE K-13 WITH ME ON THIS ONE.
WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER BEFORE AND HE'S PROVED USEFUL.
HODGKINS, SEND IN K-13.
Yes, sir.
DOWN, BOY.
HOW ARE YOU?
HOW ARE YOU, BOY?
WELL, ARE YOU READY FOR ANOTHER ONE?
THIS MAY BE A TOUGH ONE, FELLA.
THINK WE CAN HANDLE IT?
NOW REMEMBER, WE'RE DEALING WITH KAOS AND IF WE FALL INTO THEIR HANDS, THEY'LL SHOW US NO MERCY.
YOU THINK WE CAN FACE EXCRUCIATING TORTURE?
- AGENT 99 WILL MEET YOU AT THE AIRPORT.
- GOOD.
UH, HOW WILL I KNOW 99, CHIEF?
USE THE FOLLOWING  "NEW YORK METS WIN DOUBLE-HEADER".
HEY, I LIKE THAT.
NEW YORK METS WIN DOUBLE-HEADER.
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
IS SIMPLE-- FIND KAOS AND DESTROY IT, GET MR.
BIG, RESCUE PROFESSOR DANTE AND BRING BACK THE INTHERMO.
THIS MAY RUN INTO A LITTLE OVERTIME, CHIEF.
MAX, YOU REALIZE YOU'LL BE FACING EVERY KIND OF DANGER IMAGINABLE.
AND LOVING IT.
YES.
MAX, WE'RE TRAINED NOT TO HAVE ANY PERSONAL FEELINGS, BUT I THINK YOU KNOW THAT IF I HAD ANY CHILDREN, I'D LIKE THEM TO BE LIKE YOU AND FANG.
THANK YOU, CHIEF.
GOOD HUNTING, MAX, AND REMEMBER THE  "NEW YORK METS WIN DOUBLE-HEADER".
THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE.
Flight 92, Transcontinental Airlines, now departing gate 7.
SIT, BOY, SIT.
COME ON, SIT, SIT.
GOOD BOY.
STAY HERE.
"NEW YORK METS WIN DOUBLE-HEADER"!
YOU WAIT HERE.
MOTHER WILL GO CHECK ON OUR TICKETS.
OKAY.
NEW YORK METS WIN DOUBLE-HEADER.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ANY NEW DEVELOPMENTS FROM KAOS?
WHAT ABOUT DANTE AND THE INTHERMO?
ARE YOU 99?
NO, I'M SIX AND A HALF.
NEW YORK METS WIN DOUBLE-HEADER.
I KNOW, I KNOW.
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE SCORE WAS - ARE YOU 99?
- UH-HUH.
- 86?
- YES.
I THOUGHT YOU'D WANT TO GET RIGHT OUT - TO PROFESSOR DANTE'S LABORATORY AT CRAVEHAVEN.
- GOOD.
I SPOKE TO ZELINKA.
THAT'S HIS ASSISTANT.
- SHE'S EXPECTING US.
- EXCELLENT.
I HAVE A CAR OUTSIDE.
FOLLOW ME.
HOLD IT.
I THINK I'M BEING FOLLOWED.
THERE'S A MAN RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
- UH-HUH.
WHERE?
- DON'T TURN AROUND, BUT YOU CAN SEE HIM THROUGH MY MIRRORED CUFFLINKS.
UH-HUH.
WHO'S HE?
PROBABLY A RECEPTION COMMITTEE FROM KAOS.
YOU WAIT HERE.
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- I'M GONNA USE MY LOCKER KEY.
- 34?
- YES, 86.
MAN BEHIND ME-- GUN UNDER HIS RAINCOAT.
PROBABLY KAOS AGENT.
PUT PLAN Y-14 INTO EFFECT.
AS DECOYS.
- ALL RIGHT?
- ALL RIGHT.
THE PLAN IS Y-14.
- LET'S GO.
- RIGHT.
THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST EXPERIMENTAL LABORATORIES IN THE WORLD.
WE HAVE ALL THE FINEST EQUIPMENT.
OH, TRY IT AGAIN AT 700 CCMs. SAY, ISN'T THIS THE INTHERMO?
OH NO, THAT'S ONLY A DUMMY MODEL OF THE STOLEN INTHERMO, BUT IT CAN BE USED TO DEMONSTRATE HOW THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THERMAL CONCENTRICITY HOLDS TRUE.
ACTUALLY, THE DYNAMICS OF THE CATALYTIC PHENOMENA IS EXPRESSED IN DIRECT RATIO TO ITS INITIAL MOLECULAR CONCLUSION.
YES, WELL, PERHAPS WE'D BETTER GET ON TO SOMETHING ELSE.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE WHEN THE PROFESSOR WAS ABDUCTED.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, 99, I'D LIKE TO HANDLE THIS MYSELF.
RIGHT.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU WERE WHEN THE PROFESSOR DANTE WAS ABDUCTED.
YOU CAME OUTSIDE AND YOU SAW THEM STRUGGLING WITH PROFESSOR DANTE.
EXACTLY WHERE DID THAT TAKE PLACE?
THE CAR WAS OVER THERE BY THE BUSHES.
LOOK, HE'S FOUND SOMETHING.
COME HERE, FANG.
COME HERE, BOY.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, BOY?
COME HERE.
OH, IT'S ONLY AN OLD BANANA PEEL.
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT TO ME?
I'LL THROW IT AWAY.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT'S FUNNY.
IT'S MADE OF RUBBER.
HERE, LET ME SEE THAT.
A RUBBER BANANA PEEL.
HMM.
A RUBBER BANANA.
THAT'S STRANGE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S SOMETHING WRITTEN ON THIS.
"SOU STRET NOV".
WHAT COULD THAT MEAN?
"SOUTH STREET NOVELTY INC".
SOUTH STREET.
THAT'S DOWN BY THE WATERFRONT.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
THEY COULD HAVE VERY EASILY HAVE DROPPED THIS WHEN THEY ABDUCTED THE PROFESSOR.
GET THE CAR.
- I THINK WE SHOULD FOLLOW THIS UP.
- RIGHT.
HMM YOU KNOW, THIS MAY BE OUR FIRST REAL LEAD.
BUT WHY A RUBBER BANANA?
THANK YOU, ZELINKA.
BUT WHY A RUBBER BANANA PEEL?
-  - SORRY, FANG.
KAOS IS BROADCASTING AGAIN.
We will offer a practical demonstration of the Inthermo's enormous power.
At 4:00 this afternoon in full view of downtown Manhattan we will destroy a great public figure.
This is K.A.O.S.
, KAOS, singing off.
A GREAT PUBLIC FIGURE AT 4:00 THIS AFTERNOON.
- WHAT TIME IS IT NOW?
- 2:20.
EXACTLY ONE HOUR AND 40 MINUTES AND NOTHING TO GO ON BUT A RUBBER BANANA PEEL.
STEP ON IT.
HERE, BOY.
IT'S ALL SET.
SMART'S ON HIS WAY UP.
MOVE INTO POSITION.
- YES?
- I BELIEVE THIS IS ONE OF YOUR RUBBER BANANA PEELS.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHEN IT WAS PURCHASED AND BY WHOM.
I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D MAKE IT SNAPPY.
WE'RE IN KIND OF A HURRY.
UH, THIS LOOKS LIKE IT.
YOU'LL PROBABLY FIND WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ON PAGE EIGHT.
WELL, I DON'T SEE ANYTHING HERE.
HERE.
WHERE?
HERE.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, 99?
- UH-HUH.
HOW ABOUT YOU?
YES, FORTUNATELY, FANG KNOCKED ME OUT OF THE WAY JUST IN TIME.
PHEW.
THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
YES, NOW WE'VE GOT EXACTLY WHY, YOU'RE A GIRL.
YES.
HE'S RIGHT.
YES, I SUPPOSE SO.
WE'VE GOT EXACTLY TO STOP THEM FROM USING THAT INTHERMO AGAIN.
THE BEAM MUST HAVE COME FROM SOMEWHERE OUT IN THE HARBOR.
BE CAREFUL.
YES, WELL, I DON'T SEEM TO SEE ANYTHING DOWN THERE.
THERE'S NOTHING OUT THERE EXCEPT THAT OLD GARBAGE SCOW.
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING FUNNY ABOUT THAT OLD SCOW.
I'VE GOT IT!
SEAGULLS!
OH.
BUT THERE ARE NO SEAGULLS.
EXACTLY.
DID YOU EVER SEE AN OLD GARBAGE SCOW WITHOUT SEAGULLS HOVERING OVER IT?
I'D BETTER TAKE A CLOSER LOOK.
OF COURSE, THAT IT!
RUBBER TRASH-- USING IT FOR CAMOUFLAGE.
PROFESSOR DANTE AND THE INTHERMO ARE ON THAT BOAT, OR I'M NOT SMART.
WE'VE GOTTA GET DOWN THERE, GRAB ONE OF THOSE DINGHIES AND GET ONBOARD THAT BOAT BEFORE THEY USE - THAT DARN THING AGAIN.
COME ON.
- RIGHT.
GOOD.
THEY'RE BELOW DECK.
KEEP LOW AND KEEP QUIET.
TOSS THE GUN OVERBOARD.
THE OLD GARBAGE TRICK, EH?
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME IT'S BEEN PULLED ON ME THIS YEAR.
MR.
BIG WANTS TO SEE YOU.
SO YOU'RE MR.
BIG.
SO YOU'RE MAXWELL SMART.
AT LAST WE MEET FACE-TO-FACE.
PLEASE MAKE YOURSELVES COMFORTABLE.
WHAT AN UNEXPECTED AND DELIGHTFUL PLEASURE TO HAVE THE ILLUSTRIOUS MAXWELL SMART AS MY GUEST.
WILL YOU HAVE A DRINK?
OH, UH, NO.
NO.
PERHAPS A CIGARETTE?
THOSE ARE TRULY MAGNIFICENT BLENDS SPECIALLY IMPORTED FOR ME FROM HEIDELBERG.
VERY GOOD.
I SEE THAT WHAT YOUR ORGANIZATION LACKS IN STRATEGY MORE THAN MAKES UP IN LOVELINESS.
- THANK YOU.
- TAKE THEM BELOW AND MAKE THEM AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS POSSIBLE.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
I HAVE AN ALTERNATE PLAN.
- ZELINKA!
- OF COURSE.
THAT EXPLAINS WHY IT WAS SO EASY FOR THEM TO KIDNAP THE PROFESSOR.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WISH TO SAY?
YOU'RE VERY CLEVER, MY CHARMING LITTLE FRIEND.
BUT NOT CLEVER ENOUGH.
YOU SEE, THE MOMENT I SUSPECTED THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THIS OLD SCOW, I IMMEDIATELY TELEPHONED HEADQUARTERS.
AND I HAPPEN TO KNOW THAT AT THIS VERY MINUTE SEVEN COASTGUARD CUTTERS ARE CONVERGING ON THIS BOAT.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
SEVEN.
I FIND THAT PRETTY HARD TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE SIX?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT TWO COPS IN A ROWBOAT?
YOU'RE STALLING, MR.
SMART.
TAKE THEM BELOW.
NO!
ALL RIGHT, SMART, GET YOUR HANDS UP.
UP!
THAT'LL HOLD YOU.
- ARE THEY GONE?
- RIGHT.
WELL, CHIEF WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE INFLATO-COAT.
NOW, THEY'VE GOT PROFESSOR DANTE TIED UP IN THE OTHER ROOM.
- SO HERE'S WHAT WE'LL DO-- -  WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT'S THAT?
THEY MUST BE WARMING UP THE INTHERMO.
- SO THAT'S THEIR TARGET!
- WHAT?
MISS LIBERTY HERSELF.
OKAY, 99, HERE'S THE PLAN.
I'LL UNTIE FANG AND RELEASE THE PROFESSOR.
YOU KNOCK OVER THE GUARD AND TAKE HIS GUN.
RIGHT.
MAX!
WELL, IT'S JUST THAT I'M SO GOOD AT KNOTS.
EXCELLENT.
WE'RE RIGHT ON TARGET.
SMART'S ESCAPED!
-  - IT'S JAMMED.
OKAY, PROFESSOR, NOW LET'S DEACTIVATE THAT INTHERMO.
GET SMART, YOU FOOLS!
HELP!
MAXWELL, HELP!
MAX, LOOK OUT!
DID YOU DEACTIVATE THE INTHERMO?
WELL, I COULDN'T DO IT.
YOU SEE, THE NUCLEAR POWER WAS FROZEN.
I'VE GOT TO STOP THAT MADMAN.
NO NO NO NO.
WHEN I COULD NOT DEACTIVATE IT, I REVERSED IT TO SELF-DESTRUCTION, SO WHEN THE MAN WOULD PRESS THE BUTTON, THIS SHIP WOULD BECOME ONE BIG BLAZING INFERNO!
AH!
THAT'S WHAT I MEANT TO CALL IT-- DANTE'S INFERNO!
- CAN YOU SWIM, PROFESSOR?
- NO, BUT I AM FAMILIAR WITH ARCHIMEDES' PRINCIPLE OF DISPLACEMENT OF WATER IN WHICH-- COME ON, FANG!
WELL, THAT'S THE END OF MR.
BIG.
IF ONLY HE COULD HAVE TURNED HIS EVIL GENIUS INTO NICENESS.
WELL, I'D BETTER LET THE CHIEF KNOW.
SMART HERE, MAXWELL SMART.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.
PROFESSOR DANTE RESCUED, KAOS DESTROYED.
AND I TAKE GREAT PRIDE IN SAYING THAT THE FORCES OF EVIL HAVE ONCE AGAIN BEEN FOILED IN THEIR ATTEMPT TO EXTINGUISH THE TORCH OF LIBERTY.
WHAT?
OH, SORRY.
WRONG NUMBER.
{END OF EPISODE 01}{START OF EPISODE 02}
UH, PARDON ME.
I WONDER IF YOU WOULD MIND WORKING ON THAT SHOE FOR A WHILE.
THIS IS SMART, MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86.
IMMEDIATELY.
JUST A MINUTE.
WHO IS THIS?
THIS IS THE CHIEF.
WHO ELSE WOULD BE CALLING YOU ON YOUR SHOE?
YES, WELL, YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING ME THE DAY'S PASSWORD?
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY, MAX.
THERE'S NO TIME FOR-- I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO FURTHER IDENTIFY YOURSELF.
I'M TELLING YOU, MAX, THIS IS THE CHIEF.
WELL, IF YOU CAN'T GIVE ME THE DAY'S PASSWORD, I'LL ACCEPT THE COUNTERSIGN OR TODAY'S SECRET CODE NUMBER.
MY LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT.
GET IN HERE, MAX, OR I'LL PERSONALLY TEAR YOU APART!
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME, CHIEF.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.
EXCUSE ME.
I'M IN A HURRY.
- 86, I'VE GOT A NEW ASSIGNMENT FOR YOU.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- IT'S A KIDNAPPING CASE.
- OH, GOOD.
WHO DO YOU WANT ME TO KIDNAP?
NO, MAX.
I WANT YOU TO PREVENT A KIDNAPPING.
IN THE LAST 10 DAYS EIGHT BLONDES HAVE BEEN ABDUCTED IN WASHINGTON FROM THIS AREA.
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THAT?
WELL, IT'S EITHER A CONSPIRACY OR SOME GUY'S GOT A PRETTY WEIRD HOBBY.
THESE ARE THE GIRLS.
ALL OF THEM WERE REGISTERED AT THE HOTEL CRAMLEY.
NOW, WE HAVE ONE CLUE-- ORIENTALS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED AT THE SCENE OF EACH KIDNAPPING.
LISTENING TO ME?
HMM?
OH, YES.
YES, OF COURSE, CHIEF.
WE SUSPECT THE ORIENTAL ARM OF KAOS MAY BE INVOLVED.
MM-HMM, KAOS, THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF EVIL.
THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY.
- MAX!
- HMM?
PRINCESS INGRID OF SCANDINAVIA IS VISITING WASHINGTON.
SHE'S STAYING AT THE HOTEL CRAMLEY AND SHE'S A BLONDE.
- ANY QUESTIONS SO FAR?
- UH, YES.
COULD I SEE #4 AGAIN?
THE PRINCESS IS TRAVELING INCOGNITO BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO AVOID NEWSPAPERMEN AND SECURITY AGENTS.
BUT WE'VE GOT TO PROTECT HER!
OH, YOU'RE AFRAID THAT SHE'LL BE KIDNAPPED, RIGHT?
THERE'S A NATO MEETING ABOUT TO TAKE PLACE IN HER COUNTRY.
IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN TO HER, OUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION WOULD BE SERIOUSLY COMPROMISED.
NOW LET ME GET TO THE REASON I'M PUTTING YOU ON THIS CASE.
YOUR FOLDER IS RIGHT HERE.
LET ME SEE SALZMANN, SAXON, SCHWARTZ-- SCHWARTZ?
THAT'S-- HE'S A REAL GO-GETTER.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF, I CAN HANDLE THIS JOB.
REMEMBER HOW I HANDLED MY LAST TWO ASSIGNMENTS?
SEND IN SCHWARTZ.
SCHWARTZ IN RANGOON?
WHAT'S HE DOING THERE?
OH, HE IS BEING HELD PRISONER.
WELL, ANYWAY, HE'S ON THE JOB.
OKAY, SMART LET'S SEE OH, YES, THIS IS WHY WE PUT YOU ON THIS CASE.
FIVE YEARS AGO, WHEN THE PRINCESS'S FATHER SPOKE AT THE UNITED NATIONS, YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.
OH, THAT PRINCESS INGRID!
OF COURSE, YES.
SHE KNOWS YOU AND SHE TRUSTS YOU.
I'M PUTTING HER SAFETY IN YOUR HANDS.
YOU WON'T REGRET IT, CHIEF.
NOW I'VE WRITTEN THE LOCATION OF YOUR CONTACTS ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER.
BE SURE TO DESTROY IT.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
NO NO NO, MAX!
FIRST MEMORIZE IT, THEN DESTROY IT.
I'M SORRY, CHIEF.
LET'S GO SEE CARLETON IN THE LAB.
HE'S GOT SOME NEW EQUIPMENT FOR YOU.
UH, THIS IS OUR NEW 27-F CIGARETTE LIGHTER.
IT SIGHTS DOWN THE WICK AND IT FIRES A .
22-CALIBER BULLET.
- IT WHAT?
- I SAID IT FIRES A .
22-CALIBER BULLET.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
LET'S GET ON TO SOMETHING.
WHAT ABOUT THE NEW WRIST COMMUNICATOR T-37?
RIGHT HERE, SIR.
NOW, MAX, YOU'LL USE THIS TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH US.
BUT, CHIEF, I STILL HAVE MY SHOE PHONE.
TURN IN YOUR SHOES, MAX.
I THINK THE WRIST COMMUNICATOR WILL BE MORE EFFECTIVE.
GEE WHIZ, CHIEF, I STILL HAVE 60 MESSAGE UNITS LEFT THIS MONTH.
WE'VE DEVELOPED A NEW PAIR OF SHOES IN THE LAB, 86.
NOTICE THE STEEL-ENFORCED TOES FOR KICKING?
AND INSIDE THE HEELS THERE ARE SECRET COMPARTMENTS CONTAINING OUR LATEST EMERGENCY PELLETS.
CAN I SEE IT IN A 10?
SHOW HIM THE PELLETS, CARLETON.
IN THE LEFT HEEL COMPARTMENT THERE ARE TWO PELLETS.
THE SMALLER ONE IS A CONCUSSION PELLET.
NOW IF IT'S THROWN UP AGAINST SOMETHING OR ACTIVATED BY HEAT, IT WILL BLOW A 10-BY-15 ROOM TO SMITHEREENS.
NOW, MAX, DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS LARGER PILL IS FOR?
LARGER ROOMS.
MAX, KAOS DOES HAVE WAYS OF MAKING A MAN TALK.
IF YOU ARE CAPTURED AND IF IT LOOKS REALLY TOUGH, THIS MAY BE YOUR ONE ACE IN THE HOLE.
THIS PILL WHEN SWALLOWED WILL BRING PAINLESS DEATH IN ABOUT 20 SECONDS.
- ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?
- HOW DO I GET THEM TO TAKE IT?
LET'S GET ON TO THE NEXT PELLET.
THIS-- THIS PELLET CONTAINS A VERY VOLATILE LIQUID.
WHEN ACTIVATED, IT PRODUCES A THICK PROTECTIVE SMOKE SCREEN.
NOW I'M ASSIGNING AGENT 99 TO ACCOMPANY YOU ON THIS ONE, MAX.
THE PRINCESS HAS A REPUTATION OF BEING A LITTLE BIT WILD AND I THINK IT'LL TAKE BOTH OF YOU TO WATCH HER AND KEEP HER OUT OF TROUBLE.
I'M RARING TO GO, CHIEF, JUST AS SOON AS I GET THIS SHOE ON.
ACTUALLY, CHIEF, I DON'T THINK I'LL BE NEEDING THE SMOKE PELLET.
MAXWELL SMART.
COME RIGHT IN.
IT'S OPEN.
SHE SHOULDN'T LEAVE HER DOOR UNLOCKED LIKE THAT.
- WHO IS IT?
- UH, AN OLD FRIEND.
I'LL BE THERE IN A MOMENT.
HEY, YOU KNOW THE PRINCESS ALREADY, DON'T YOU, MAX?
YES, I MET HER FIVE YEARS AGO.
SHE WAS A SWEET FRECKLED-FACED - WHAT IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO WITH US?
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, 99.
- WHY WOULDN'T SHE WANT TO GO WITH US?
- MAXIE!
MAXIE, DARLING!
INGRID?
ISN'T SHE SWEET?
SHE HASN'T CHANGED A BIT.
SHE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME 15-YEAR-OLD.
UH, AHEM, PRINCESS, UH I WANT YOU TO MEET AGENT 99.
WE'VE BEEN ASSIGNED TO ESCORT YOU AROUND WASHINGTON.
- WHERE DO YOU WANT TO TAKE ME?
- UH, YES, WELL, - WE'LL GO AND SEE ALL THE SHRINES AND MONUMENTS.
- ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I COME TO WASHINGTON ONCE A YEAR, AND I WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN.
YES, WELL, WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO?
- TO YOUR PLACE.
- MY PLACE.
WELL, THERE'S NO REAL HISTORICAL - SIGNIFICANCE TO MY PLACE.
- MMM, THERE COULD BE.
I WANT TO HAVE SOME FUN.
I'M GOING TO GO GET MY COAT, AND THEN I'M GOING DANCING.
I'M GOING TO DO THE WATUSI AND THE WALK AND THE SWIM AND THE PONY.
AHEM.
YES.
WELL, 99, YOU'RE A WOMAN, AREN'T YOU?
WHAT CAN WE DO TO STOP HER?
HOW ABOUT A TRANQUILIZER?
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.
WELL, MAXIE, DARLING, I THINK YOU'VE GOT TO SHOW HER WHAT A SWINGER YOU ARE, THAT YOU CAN DO THE FRUG AND THE WATUSI AND THE SWIM - AND THE PONY-- - I KNOW, I KNOW.
JUST GIVE A GOOD EXAMPLE.
BUT OF COURSE.
OKAY, NOW GIVE ME A BAD EXAMPLE.
-  - I'LL GET IT.
- PACKAGE FOR MISS SWENSON.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- 99!
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
- QUICK, COME HERE.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, MAX?
- SHH.
DON'T MAKE A MOVE, DON'T MAKE A SOUND.
I DON'T KNOW FOR SURE, PRINCESS, BUT I THINK I'VE JUST SAVED YOUR FLOWER.
THEY NEED A LOT OF WATER, YOU KNOW.
NOW ABOUT OUR ITINERARY-- BEFORE WE GET TO THE DANCING, WE'RE GOING TO VISIT SOME REAL SWINGING PLACES-- the White House, the Lincoln Memorial, Washington Monument, the Smithsonian Institute, and the National Art Gallery.
OH, BOBO, HOW IRONIC-- OUR OLD FRIEND MAXWELL SMART HAS LED US TO OUR TARGET.
WHAT A PLEASURE IT WILL BE TO ELIMINATE HIM.
I WILL FORCE AIR BUBBLES INTO HIS BLOODSTREAM.
STOP STOP!
I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR IT.
YOU KNOW HOW I DETEST VIOLENCE.
I WILL THANK YOU TO DO YOUR FIENDISH WORK, - BUT DO NOT TELL ME ABOUT IT.
- YES, MASTER.
HOW DO YOU FORCE AIR BUBBLES INTO THE BLOODSTREAM?
- UH-- - NEVER MIND.
I DO NOT WANT TO HEAR.
WE MUST CONCENTRATE ON OUR PLAN WHICH HAS IMPROVED NOW THAT WE KNOW THEIR FULL ITINERARY-- KIDNAP THE PRINCESS AND GET SMART.
NO NO, MAX.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANYMORE OF YOUR SHRINES AND MONUMENTS.
YOU TOLD ME YOU WOULD TAKE ME TO SOME SWINGING PLACES.
WELL, WE JUST SAW THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE.
THAT WAS EXCITING, WASN'T IT?
MY HEART IS STILL THUMPING.
REALLY?
LET ME FEEL.
- STOP THAT, PRINCESS.
- YOU'RE REALLY GOING TO FIND THE STOP THRILLING.
- WON'T SHE, MAXIE?
- PLEASE, 99.
WOULD YOU PLEASE SHOW THE PRINCESS AROUND THE ART GALLERY?
- I HAVE TO REPORT IN.
- OF COURSE.
RIGHT THIS WAY, PRINCESS.
THIS IS 86 REPORTING IN TO CONTROL.
HELLO, CHIEF?
THIS IS MAX.
I'M AT THE NATIONAL ART GALLERY.
ANYTHING UNUSUAL TO REPORT?
WELL, WE JUST CAME FROM THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTE AND WE SAW THE PLANE "THE SPIRIT OF ST.
LOUIS".
SO?
CHIEF, WAS CHARLES LINDBERGH CHINESE?
OF COURSE NOT.
THEN I THINK WE'RE BEING FOLLOWED.
OVER AND OUT.
REALLY, MAX, THIS TOUR IS INTOLERABLE.
THE DAY IS NEARLY GONE AND WE HAVEN'T HAD ANYFUN.
ALLOW ME, PRINCESS.
WONDERFUL, MAXIE.
AT LAST SOME EXCITEMENT.
INTO EFFECT IMMEDIATELY.
- THAT'S 49-K.
- RIGHT, 86.
- MAX?
- HELLO CONTROL, HELLO CONTROL?
- 99?
- YES, 86?
- WHAT IS PLAN 49-K?
- I TAKE THE SUBJECT TO MY APARTMENT - AND DON'T LET HER OUT OF MY SIGHT.
- RIGHT.
- THIS IS AGENT 99, AGENT 99-- - 99?
- YES, 86?
- WHAT DO I DO?
- YOU FOLLOW THE SUSPECT.
- RIGHT.
CONDITION RED.
COME ON, PRINCESS.
THE OLD PICTURE-IN-THE-KEYHOLE TRICK.
THAT'S TWICE THIS MONTH.
A SIMPLE TRICK, BUT EFFECTIVE ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU OUR PRISONER.
NOT QUITE YET, MY FRIEND.
IF HE SHOOTS ME, I SHOOT YOU.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, BOBO.
INGENIOUS, ISN'T IT, MR.
SMART?
IT'S ACTS LIKE THAT THAT KILLED VAUDEVILLE.
VERY AMUSING, MR.
SMART.
I SUPPOSE YOU CAN GUESS WHAT THEY CALL ME.
LEFTY?
NO, MR.
SMART.
I AM EMPLOYED BY KAOS, THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF EVIL.
MY NAME IS THE CLAW.
- THE CRAW?
- NO, NOT "THE CRAW".
- THE CLAW.
- OH, YES, "THE CRAW".
PERHAPS YOU WOULD TELL ME, MR.
CRAW, WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH ALL THOSE BLONDES YOU'VE KIDNAPPED.
THEY ARE ALL PERFECTLY SAFE, MR.
SMART.
ACTUALLY, THE ONLY GIRL WE WANT IS PRINCESS INGRID.
THEN WHY DID YOU ABDUCT THE OTHERS?
UNFORTUNATELY, MR.
SMART, ALL AMERICANS LOOK ALIKE TO US.
WE MAY BE DIABOLICAL, BUT WE ARE NOT PERFECT.
BOBO.
AND NOW, MR.
SMART, YOU WILL TELL US THE PRINCESS'S WHEREABOUTS.
NO, MY FRIEND, YOU WILL NEVER GET YOUR CRAWS ON HER.
NO NO NO, NOT CRAWS, CRAWS.
-  - OH, YES, OF COURSE, "CRAWS".
I SUPPOSE YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT ME BURIED IN THIS BACKROOM IN THIS BUILDING ON COMMONWEALTH AND EIGHTH STREETS.
HAVE ALL MOBILE UNITS STAND BY FOR MY INSTRUCTIONS.
NOT EIGHTH STREET, MR.
SMART, - "F" STREET.
- OH, YES, "F" STREET.
And it's "Crover" Avenue.
"CROVER" AVENUE.
UH, CLOVER.
OH, THAT MUST BE NEAR NINTH AND DELAWARE?
- ONLY IF YOU TAKE THE CUTOFF AT EXIT 4.
- OH, EXIT 4.
- That must be under the overpass.
- No no no-- - over the underpass.
- Over the underpass.
OVER THE UNDERPASS.
GOOD, THAT'S ALL WE NEED TO KNOW.
INDEED IT IS, MR.
SMART.
YOUR CHIEF WILL NEVER FIND YOU WITH THOSE DIRECTIONS.
AND NOW YOU WILL TELL US THE LOCATION OF THE PRINCESS.
- NEVER!
- I HAVE A WAY TO LOOSEN YOUR TONGUE, MR.
SMART.
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF THE CHINESE BAMBOO-STALKS- UNDER-THE-FINGERNAILS TORTURE?
NO.
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
YOU PLACE CHINESE BAMBOO STALKS - UNDER THE FINGERNAILS.
- UNDER THE FINGERNAILS.
- YES, I REMEMBER NOW.
- BOBO, EXECUTE THE CHINESE BAMBOO-STALK- FINGERNAIL TORTURE.
HIM, YOU FOOL, NOT ME.
AND DON'T IMAGINE YOUR CRIES OF PAIN WILL BRING ASSISTANCE, MR.
SMART!
THE ACTIVITIES OF OUR SHANGHAI A-GO-GO DISCOTHEQUE - ARE JUST GETTING STARTED.
-  IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING A USEFUL FRONT TO OUR ORGANIZATION, THAT RAUCOUS SOUND WILL SMOTHER YOUR CRIES FOR HELP.
MR.
SMART, ONE LAST APPEAL TO REASON-- I DO NOT CARE FOR TORTURE.
MUST YOU BE SO STUBBORN?
I'D LIKE A CHANCE TO THINK THIS OVER.
DO YOU MIND IF I SMOKE?
OH, NOT AT ALL.
- TAKE YOUR TIME.
- THANK YOU.
THESE THINGS NEVER WORK.
YOUR TIME IS UP.
WELL, I'M AFRAID I HAVE NOTHING TO TELL YOU, MR.
CRAW.
THEN FOR MY FIRST TORTURE PLEASE REMOVE YOUR SHOES.
MY SHOES?
YES, OF COURSE, I'D BE GLAD TO REMOVE MY SHOES.
YOU ARE FORCING ME TO DO THIS, MR.
SMART.
WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THE BAMBOO-STALKS-UNDER- THE-FINGERNAIL TORTURE?
I KIND OF LIKED THAT ONE.
WE FOUND THIS TO BE MORE EFFECTIVE.
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, STAND BACK.
HOW BIG IS THIS ROOM?
- ABOUT 1O-BY-15.
- PERFECT.
DON'T MOVE OR I'LL BLOW YOU ALL TO KINGDOM COME.
- BOBO, DROP THAT GUN.
- HE'S BLUFFING.
BOBO, GET HIM!
STAND BACK.
WRONG PILL.
I THINK I'VE JUST POISONED THE ROOM.
NO, MR.
SMART, THERE'LL BE NO MORE OF YOUR SILLY TRICKS.
- 86!
- 99.
OH, MAX, I'M SO SORRY BUT THE PRINCESS GOT AWAY FROM ME.
I COULDN'T HELP IT.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
YES, BUT WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
THE SHANGHAI A-GO-GO IS A KAOS FRONT.
THIS IS THE ONE PLACE THE PRINCESS MUST NOT COME.
- OH, NO.
- HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?
I DIDN'T.
LOOK.
- I FOLLOWED HER HERE.
- WELL, WE'VE GOTTA GET THE PRINCESS-- OH MY GOSH!
THE POOR DEVILS!
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO THEM?
THEY'RE DANCING, MAX.
THAT'S THE STYLE NOW.
LISTEN, 99, WE'VE GOTTA GET THAT PRINCESS OUT OF HERE - WITHOUT LOOKING CONSPICUOUS.
- RIGHT.
- LET'S DANCE OVER.
- BUT I-- INGRID.
INGRID, YOU'RE IN TERRIBLE DANGER.
AS A FRIEND OF YOUR FATHER, I MUST REMIND YOU THAT YOU'RE A PRINCESS.
- I'LL DO WHATEVER YOU SAY, MAX.
- GOOD.
NOW REMEMBER, DIGNITY AND DECORUM AT ALL TIMES.
- 99.
- OH, HEY, MAX.
- 99, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- OH, WHAT'S THE PLAN, MAX?
THE PLAN IS TO GET THE PRINCESS AND GET HER OUT THAT EXIT.
WELL, LET'S GO.
- HOW ABOUT NOW?
- WELL, THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING TO US WITH ALL THESE PEOPLE AROUND.
I THINK WE'D BETTER KEEP DANCING.
- OKAY.
- AND WATCH YOUR ELBOW, 99.
MAX, LOOK OUT!
BEHIND YOU!
BEHIND YOU!
WE'VE GOT THE BEAT.
YEAH!
YOU STILL HAVE ME TO DEAL WITH, MR.
SMART.
YOU HAVE INTERFERED WITH KAOS FOR THE LAST TIME.
JUST A MINUTE, MR.
CRAW.
CRAW, NOT CRAW!
CRAW!
- HAVE YOU GOT A GUN, 99?
- RIGHT.
KEEP HIM COVERED.
ALL RIGHT, MR.
CRAW, ONE FALSE MOVE AND SHE BLOWS YOUR HEAD OFF.
DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE SIZE OF THE GUN, MR.
CRAW.
IT FIRES A .
1-CALIBER POISONED PIN THAT KILLS INSTANTLY.
THIS IS AGENT 86 REPORTING TO CONTROL.
HELLO, CHIEF?
SMART HERE.
YES, THE PRINCESS IS SAFE.
I'M AT THE SHANGHAI A-GO-GO DISCOTHEQUE.
BETTER SEND SOME MEN AND SOME HANDCUFFS.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
HANDCUFF.
NO, CHIEF, YOU MAKE A RIGHT ON SPRING AND A LEFT ON "CROVER"-- UH, CLOVER.
YES.
THEN IT'S THE SECOND LEFT TO CONSTITUTION.
NO, CHIEF, YOU GO UNDER THE OVERPASS AND OVER THE UNDERPASS.
NO, CHIEF, A RIGHT AT SPRING AND A LEFT AT CLOVER-- "CROVER" I AM PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU.
THE CLAW AND HIS MEN ARE BEHIND BARS, THOSE EIGHT GIRLS HAVE BEEN RESCUED, AND THE PRINCESS IS ON HER WAY TO SCANDINAVIA.
- CONGRATULATIONS, MAX.
- THANK YOU.
- CONGRATULATIONS, 99.
- THANK YOU.
- ALL IN A DAY'S WORK.
- I'M SORRY YOU COULDN'T HAVE ACCOMPANIED THE PRINCESS BACK TO HER COUNTRY AS SHE REQUESTED, - BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT OF VIEW.
- CHIEF-- - MY WHAT?
!
- YOUR WRITTEN REPORT, - IN WHICH YOU POINTED OUT THE INADVISABILITY - UH, CHIEF-- OF A SINGLE MALE AGENT TRAVELING WITH THE PRINCESS.
- I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU.
- BUT I NEVER MADE OUT - ANY WRITTEN REPORT.
- I'D LIKE TO CHECK OUT NOW.
- ANYWAY, WE SENT K-13 ALONG.
- FANG?
- YES, HE'LL TAKE CARE OF HER.
- WELL, FANG'S A GOOD MAN, - BUT CHIEF-- - 86, DO YOU MIND IF I TALK OVER SOME CONFIDENTIAL ASPECTS OF THIS CASE WITH 99?
I'LL SEE YOU IN A MOMENT.
YOU WROTE THAT REPORT, DIDN'T YOU?
UM, YES, SIR.
I, UH I JUST WANTED TO SAVE MAX SOME EMBARRASSMENT.
HE GETS SEASICK.
IN A PLANE?
IT FLIES OVER WATER.
- NO NO, CHIEF, YOU'RE NOT DOING IT RIGHT.
- ARE YOU ABSOLUTELY SURE, 99?
I'M POSITIVE.
I'M AN EXPERT ON THIS.
NOW YOU GOT TO SHOW ME.
IT'S VITAL.
- NOW THAT'S AN ORDER.
- ALL RIGHT.
NOW FIRST YOU JUST STAND STILL AND YOU GET YOUR HIPS MOVING FIRST.
THEN YOU ADD THE ARMS.
- THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT.
- OH, I SEE.
- NOW TRY THE PONY.
- THE WHAT?
{END OF EPISODE 02}{START OF EPISODE 03}
HELLO, CHIEF?
THIS IS AGENT 86, MAXWELL SMART.
I'M ON THE STREET WHERE OUR ESPIONAGE TRAINING SCHOOL IS LOCATED.
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE MY CONTACTS.
OVER AND OUT.
CONTACTS MADE WITH PERFECT PRECISION, CHIEF.
I HAVE MY IDENTITY PAPERS, MY PASSWORD AND MY MORNING NEWSPAPER.
PASSWORD IS-- "WHEN THE MOON IS FULL THE TIDE IS HIGH".
I LIKE THAT.
INCIDENTALLY, CHIEF, I'D LIKE TO COMPLIMENT YOU AND THE SECURITY BOYS.
THIS PLACE IS A BRILLIANT FRONT.
GOOD MORNING.
WHEN THE MOON IS FULL THE TIDE IS HIGH.
YOU MUST WANT THE SPY SCHOOL.
THAT'S NEXT DOOR.
- GOOD MORNING.
- OH, GOOD MORNING.
MY NAME IS LOOMIS.
AH, YES, ALEXANDER LOOMIS.
WELCOME TO THE TRAINING SCHOOL, LOOMIS.
I'M ONE OF YOUR SPECIAL INSTRUCTORS.
- HELLO, 99.
- HOW ARE YOU, 86?
- DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING YET?
- NO.
ALL WE KNOW SO FAR IS THAT SOMEONE IN THE SCHOOL IS A KAOS INFILTRATOR.
I'VE BEEN HERE A WHOLE WEEK AND SO FAR HE HASN'T MADE ONE MISTAKE.
IF WE DON'T FIND HIM, KAOS WILL KNOW THE IDENTITY - OF EVERY AGENT IN THE TRAINING SCHOOL.
- OH, RIGHT.
I'D KNOW THAT SCRATCH ANYWHERE.
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?
HE'S BACK FOR A REFRESHER COURSE.
OH.
NOW LISTEN, FANG-- I'M HERE AS A NEW TRAINEE AND I'M GOING UNDER THE COVER NAME "LOOMIS".
SO TRY AND ACT LIKE YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
-  - GOOD BOY.
WE'RE DUE IN THE TRAINING YARD FOR CLASSES.
UNTIL YOU'RE CLEAR THE SCHOOL'S GOING TO BE UNDER MAXIMUM SECURITY.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- YOU'LL SEE.
- YOU STAY HERE, MORRIS.
-  BYE, MORRIS.
- MORRIS?
- THAT'S HIS COVER.
- ONE OF OUR NEW TRAINEES?
- YES, SIR.
I'M LOOMIS ALEXANDER.
I'M MR.
WATSON, DEAN OF THE SCHOOL; AND THIS IS HILLARY GAINSBOROUGH - FROM CONTROL'S LONDON SECTION.
- DELIGHTED TO MEET YOU, LOOMIS.
AS A MATTER OF FACT I'M NEW HERE MYSELF.
I'M JUST IN TO GIVE YOU CHAPS INSTRUCTIONS IN THE NEW SPECIAL WEAPONS.
NEW, EH?
AND BRITISH?
WHAT WAS MICKY MANTLE'S BATTING AVERAGE IN 1961?
I, UH, I DON'T KNOW.
CORRECT, BECAUSE IF YOU DID KNOW YOU'D BE AMERICAN, NOT BRITISH.
A NEW TRAINEE CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL.
- SMART.
- NO, LOOMIS.
WOULD YOU INTRODUCE THE NEW MAN TO OUR OTHER TRAINEES?
YES I WILL, SIR.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
HE'S ONE OF THE NEW TRAINEES.
- HMM, NOT BAD.
- ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH KARATE?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WHY, KARATE HAPPENS TO BE ONE OF MY FAVORITE HOBBIES.
WITH ONE PERFECTLY TIMED CHOP OF MY HAND I CAN BREAK EIGHT BOARDS THIS THICK.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
EIGHT.
I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE.
- WOULD YOU BELIEVE SEVEN?
- I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT A LOAF OF BREAD?
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I MUST REJOIN MY CLASS.
RUNDOWN ON THE REST OF THE NEW TRAINEES.
OKAY.
THEIR NAMES ARE DIMITRI, ZUKOR, AND GRILLAK.
THEY'VE ALL BEEN SENT HERE BY OUR EUROPEAN BUREAU.
MM-HMM.
I HAVE A THEORY THAT IT'S ONE OF THESE THREE.
THE MINUTE I SEE THEM I'LL BE ABLE TO PICK OUT THE ENEMY AGENT.
YOU'RE GOING TO GET YOUR CHANCE RIGHT AWAY.
THEY'RE ALL RIGHT OVER THERE TOGETHER.
MM-HMM.
OKAY, NOW LET'S TEST MY THEORY.
THAT'S GRILLAK, THAT'S DIMITRI AND THAT'S ZUKOR.
PREPARE TO THROW THROW!
- I HAVE ANOTHER THEORY.
- ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, IF YOU'LL ALL GATHER AROUND THE TABLE HERE-- OH, LOOMIS, WOULD YOU JOIN US PLEASE?
WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SHOW YOU FIRST OF ALL IS ONE OF CONTROL'S LATEST WEAPONS.
THIS IS A MULTIPART AUTOMATIC MACHINE PISTOL WHICH CAN BE PUT TOGETHER IN PRECISELY THREE SECONDS.
NOW YOU'LL SEE THAT ALL THE PARTS FIT VERY NEATLY INTO THIS COMPACT LITTLE CASE.
WELL, YOU'LL ALL GET A CHANCE TO WORK WITH THAT LATER.
BUT FIRST OF ALL LET'S HAVE A PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATION OF AN ENTIRELY NEW  THAT IS, THE WRISTWATCH STRANGLING WIRE.
NOW, WE'VE ALL GONE INTO THIS IN THEORY.
LET'S SEE HOW YOU WORK WITH IT.
NOW GRILLAK AND DIMITRI, HMM?
AND HERE'S ONE FOR YOU, LOOMIS.
WATCH THEM CAREFULLY BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO BE NEXT, HMM?
READY.
FINE.
NOW THEN, ZUKOR AND LOOMIS.
WHAT HAPPENED, LOOMIS?
I PULLED OUT THE WATCH SPRING.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S FINISH WITH THE HATS.
NOW REMEMBER, GENTLEMEN, THAT THESE HATS HAVE A RAZOR-SHARP EDGE.
THEY CAN BE A DEADLY WEAPON WHEN THEY ARE PROPERLY HANDLED.
RIGHT.
ZUKOR, YOU'RE FIRST.
LET'S SEE YOU TAKE THE HEAD OFF THE DUMMY.
GOOD, ZUKOR.
NOW LOOMIS.
AND REMEMBER, LOOMIS-- NICE, EASY ACTION.
YES, JUST A QUICK FLICK OF THE WRIST AND A FULL FOLLOW-THROUGH.
I'VE WARNED YOU PEOPLE LONG ENOUGH!
THIS TIME YOU DON'T GET THE HAT BACK!
ONE OF THOSE THREE TRAINEES IS THE IMPOSTOR, - I'M SURE OF IT.
- BUT HOW COULD AN IMPOSTOR HAVE GOTTEN INTO THE SCHOOL?
THE SAME WAY THAT I DID.
REMEMBER, I'M NOT REALLY ALEXANDER LOOMIS.
OH, YOU MEAN THAT KAOS COULD HAVE SUBSTITUTED ONE OF THEIR AGENTS FOR THE REAL DIMITRI, ZUKOR OR GRILLAK.
- EXACTLY.
- AH.
NOW I HAVE HERE THE ORIGINAL CONTROL FILES.
NOW IF ANY OF THOSE THREE DON'T MATCH THE SCHOOL FILES IN THAT SAFE, WE'VE GOT OUR IMPOSTOR.
I BROUGHT THE PLASTIC IMPACT BOMB YOU WANTED.
GOOD.
BE CAREFUL, 99.
NOW THIS WILL OPEN THE SAFE WITHOUT DESTROYING CONTROL PROPERTY.
I WOULD HAVE ASKED THE DEAN FOR THE COMBINATION BUT I WOULD HAVE HAD TO REVEAL MY OWN IDENTITY.
NOW THE BOMB IS PERFECTLY HARMLESS BUT THE IMPACT WILL OPEN ANYTHING.
FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO, ONE-- DUCK!
IT OPENED EVERYTHING BUT THE SAFE.
- LET ME READ THOSE INSTRUCTIONS AGAIN.
- MAX, WE'D BETTER HURRY.
THERE'S NO NEED TO HURRY, MISS WHATEVER-YOUR-NAME-IS, BECAUSE YOU'LL BOTH BE SPENDING THE REST OF YOUR LIVES IN PRISON.
MAX, YOU'D BETTER TELL HIM THE TRUTH.
I'M MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86.
THAT'S A LIKELY STORY.
YOU CAN CALL CONTROL HEADQUARTERS AND THE CHIEF WILL IDENTIFY HIM.
- DOES HE HAVE TO?
- WHY, ARE YOU AFRAID I'LL FIND OUT THAT YOU'RE LYING?
NO, I'M AFRAID YOU'LL TELL HIM I'M FLUNKING WEAPONS CLASS.
- MAX!
- WHAT IS IT, 99?
I JUST HEARD RUNNING FOOTSTEPS IN THE HALL.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- I'M A LITTLE TIRED BUT I'M OKAY.
MAX!
LOOK!
- OH!
- OH!
- 99, I'VE GOT A HUNCH.
- WHAT IS IT?
THIS WAS NO ACCIDENT.
HELLO, SMART.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, SMART.
GAINSBOROUGH TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR TRUE IDENTITY AND THE ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE.
ANY IDEA WHO TRIED TO KILL YOU?
JUDGING FROM THE ANGLE THE KNIVES HIT, THEY HAD TO BE THROWN BY A LEFT HANDED MAN.
THAT SHOULD NARROW IT DOWN.
NOT NECESSARILY.
ALL THREE SUSPECTS ARE LEFT HANDED.
WHAT ABOUT THE FILES?
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING THERE TO HELP YOU?
YES, WELL, ACCORDING TO THE CONTROL FILES ANY ONE OF THE THREE SUSPECTS COULD HAVE BEEN THE IMPOSTOR.
NOW THE CONTROL FILE ON DIMITRI SHOWS THAT HE SPEAKS A RARE EAST HIMALAYAN DIALECT, YET THE SCHOOL FILE MAKES NO MENTION OF IT.
YES, AND THE CONTROL FILE ON ZUKOR SHOWS THAT HE HAS AN UNUSUAL AND EXTREMELY DISTINCTIVE HANDWRITING, AND YET THE SCHOOL FILE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A EXAMPLE OF ZUKOR'S HANDWRITING.
AND ACCORDING TO THE CONTROL FILE ON GRILLAK, HE HAS A HEART-SHAPED BIRTHMARK ON HIS RIGHT KNEE, YET THE SCHOOL FILE HAS NO RECORD OF IT.
SO WE'RE GONNA CHECK THEM ALL OUT-- DIMITRI'S DIALECT, ZUKOR'S HANDWRITING AND GRILLAK'S BIRTHMARK.
-  - AH, THERE'S GRILLAK NOW.
I THINK I CAN SNEAK A LOOK AT HIS RIGHT KNEE WHILE I'M SOFTENING HIM UP WITH A LITTLE JUDO.
YES, I THINK I'LL START WITH GRILLAK.
- HI-YAH!
- HAO!
- HI-YAH!
- HI-YAH!
- HI-YAH!
- HAWH!
HI-YAAAH!
HI-YAH!
SO MUCH FOR GRILLAK.
NOW FOR DIMITRI.
- THERE'S DIMITRI.
- OH, GOOD.
NOW YOU CAN CHECK ON HIS RARE EAST HIMALAYAN DIALECT.
YES, AND I KNOW EXACTLY HOW TO DO IT.
AS A MATTER OF FACT I HEARD A VERY FUNNY EAST HIMALAYAN JOKE THE OTHER DAY.
- I'LL TELL IT TO DIMITRI.
- OKAY.
HI, DIMITRI.
UH DIMITRI, YOU LOOK LIKE A FELLA WITH A SENSE OF HUMOR.
WANT TO HEAR A GOOD JOKE?
- IF YOU WISH.
- YES.
WELL, THERE WAS THIS EAST HIMALAYAN TRAVELING SALESMAN, SEE?
AND HIS OXCART BROKE DOWN IN FRONT OF A FARMHOUSE.
HE WENT UP AND KNOCKED ON THE DOOR AND THE FARMER OPENED THE DOOR.
AND THE TRAVELING SALESMAN SAID, "OH OH OH HAY MAHU SAVALLY NAH NEY".
AND THE FARMER REPLIED, "AHKA MAHKA SOO SOO".
ISN'T THAT A SCREAM?
- HE DIDN'T LAUGH.
- YES.
- HE MUST BE THE IMPOSTOR.
- MAYBE HE HEARD THE JOKE BEFORE.
- OH.
- ON THE OTHER HAND I MAY HAVE TOLD IT WRONG.
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN, IN THIS CLASS WE ARE GOING TO PRACTICE SENDING SECRET MESSAGES TO OUR CONTACTS.
ZUKOR, WHY DON'T YOU WORK WITH LOOMIS HERE?
NOW I'D LIKE YOU TO WRITE A SECRET MESSAGE HERE-- "EXECUTE BLUE PLAN," AND SIGN IT "ZUKOR".
ZUKOR, WHY DON'T YOU WRITE ON MY BACK?
IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER.
IF HIS HANDWRITING DOESN'T MATCH THE HANDWRITING IN THE CONTROL ROOM FILE, HE'S OUR MAN.
AND ONE FOR YOU.
NOW LET'S TAKE OUR STARTING POSITIONS.
READY, AND GO.
VERY GOOD, ZUKOR.
WE'LL PRACTICE THAT AGAIN TOMORROW.
IS IT NOT PROPER PROCEDURE FOR AN AGENT WHO HAS RECEIVED A MESSAGE TO MEMORIZE AND DESTROY IT?
UM, WELL YES.
WE'VE GOT HIM.
AN EXAMPLE OF HIS HANDWRITING AND SIGNATURE.
THANKS TO MY SPECIAL JACKET WITH THE CARBON-PAPER LINING.
- GOOD WORK, 86.
- THANK YOU, 99.
THANK YOU.
WE STILL HAVE NO PROOF WHETHER DIMITRI OR ZUKOR IS THE REAL IMPOSTOR.
YES, BUT WE HAVEN'T QUITE FINISHED CHECKING OUT THAT BABY YET.
- GRILLAK?
- YES, I FEEL I SHOULD TAKE ANOTHER CRACK AT HIM.
JUST REMEMBER, MAX-- THE REAL GRILLAK HAS A HEART-SHAPED BIRTHMARK ON HIS RIGHT KNEE.
MMM.
AND IF HE DOESN'T HAVE IT, THEN HE'S THE IMPOSTOR.
RIGHT.
HI-YAH!
YAAH!
OOH!
ALL RIGHT, GRILLAK, GET UP.
WELL GRILLAK, YOU HAD ME FOOLED FOR A WHILE, BUT THE MINUTE I-- SAW MY OWN LEG I KNEW YOU WERE ALL RIGHT.
WHERE'S GAINSBOROUGH?
HE WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET ME HERE.
MAX, I DON'T LIKE YOUR PLAN.
YOU COULD BE KILLED.
YES I KNOW, BUT WE'VE GOT TO FLUSH THAT KAOS INFILTRATOR OUT INTO THE OPEN.
BUT YOU'RE DELIBERATELY SETTING YOURSELF UP AS A TARGET.
YOU'LL BE IN EXTREME DANGER EVERY MINUTE.
AND LOVING IT.
- THERE'S GAINSBOROUGH NOW.
- OH.
I'LL GO OVER THERE AND SPEAK DISTINCTLY SO EACH OF THE SUSPECTS WON'T MISS A WORD I'M SAYING.
- OKAY.
- RIGHT.
NOW, GENTLEMEN, AS YOU KNOW, UPON OCCASION AN AGENT MAY BE CALLED UPON TO READ LIPS FROM A DISTANCE.
FOR THIS, OF COURSE, YOU USE YOUR HIGH-POWERED BINOCULARS.
SHALL WE GIVE THAT A TRY?
OH LOOK, THERE'S LOOMIS TALKING TO MR.
GAINSBOROUGH.
SEE IF YOU CAN SEE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
I'D LIKE YOU AND THE DEAN AND THE REST OF THE TRAINEES TO MEET ME IN MY ROOM IN ONE HOUR.
THAT'S 5:30.
THE DEAN AND I HAVE A MEETING AT 5:15 BUT I'M SURE WE CAN MAKE IT.
- NOW WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
- UH, YES, WELL, I'M GOING TO REVEAL THE FACT THAT I AM CONTROL AGENT 86 AND THAT I KNOW THE IDENTITY OF THE KAOS INFILTRATOR AND THAT I AM GOING TO NAME THE IMPOSTOR.
- DID YOU SEE HIM?
- NO, BUT HE MUST BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.
- I'LL TRY TO FLUSH HIM OUT.
- RIGHT.
I'LL OPEN THIS CASE AND I'LL HAVE THIS GUN PUT TOGETHER IN THREE SECONDS AND I'LL BE READY FOR HIM.
OH MAX, IF ANYTHING SHOULD HAPPEN OH!
OOH!
HMMM, HE MUST BE OUT OF AMMUNITION.
NOW IF I CAN JUST OPEN THIS CASE, HE'S HAD IT.
IT'S NO USE.
DID YOU SEE WHO IT WAS, 99?
NO, HE KNOCKED ME OUT TOO.
HELP!
IT'S NO USE YELLING, 99.
WE'VE BEEN SCREAMING OUR HEADS OFF FOR 15 MINUTES.
IT'S OBVIOUS NO ONE CAN HEAR US.
HELP!
MAX, HOW ARE WE GONNA GET HELP?
THIS DYNAMITE'S GOING TO GO OFF ANY MINUTE.
- I KNOW.
WHEN THAT FLAME HITS THE FUSE WE'VE HAD IT.
- OHH - I KNOW - WHAT?
- FANG.
- AGENT K-13!
OF COURSE!
HE'LL HEAR MY SIGNAL NO MATTER WHERE HE IS.
OH!
I DON'T HEAR ANYTHING.
OF COURSE NOT, 99.
ONLY DOGS CAN HEAR THAT.
- GOOD BOY, FANG!
- LOOK, IT'S FANG!
- BLOW OUT THE CANDLES.
- QUICK.
-  - NO NO, DON'T YELL, FANG.
BLOW OUT THE CANDLE.
GO ON!
- BLOW OUT THE CANDLE.
- BLOW OUT THE CANDLE, FANG.
COME ON, FANG!
COME ON, BOY!
BLOW OUT THE CANDLE.
QUICK, FANG, PLEASE BLOW OUT THE CANDLE.
OH, IT LOOKS HOPELESS.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.
I DON'T THINK HE'S GOING TO SHOW UP.
MAYBE HE'S TIED UP SOMEPLACE.
LET'S GIVE HIM A FEW MORE MINUTES.
IT'S VITAL TO DISCOVER THE NAME OF THE KAOS INFILTRATOR.
I CERTAINLY HOPE IT IS NOT ME.
WELL GENTLEMEN, I'M SURE ONE OF YOU IS SURPRISED TO SEE US HERE-- THE MAN WHO TRIED TO BLOW US UP JUST LUCKILY I'VE HAD MY EYE ON ONE SUSPECT FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.
ZUKOR, WRITE YOUR NAME ON THAT PAD.
WITH THE HANDWRITING OF THE REAL ZUKOR IN THE CONTROL FILES.
IF IT DOESN'T MATCH, HE'S OUR MAN.
- THEY MATCH.
- IT MATCHES.
OKAY, THAT BRINGS US TO DIMITRI.
NOW ACCORDING TO THE CONTROL FILES, DIMITRI, YOU SPEAK A RARE EAST HIMALAYAN DIALECT.
YET WHEN I TOLD YOU AN EAST HIMALAYAN JOKE, YOU DIDN'T LAUGH.
WELL, THIS IS A JOKE BOOK-- WITH EVERY EAST HIMALAYAN JOKE.
ALL SIX OF THEM.
NOW LET'S SEE IF YOU REALLY KNOW THE LANGUAGE.
IF YOU DON'T YOU'RE THE IMPOSTOR.
"AN EAST HIMALAYAN BUM WALKED UP TO ME ON THE STREET ONE DAY AND SAID, 'AHNA HOHO HUNI AHA AWAHI TEE HEE.
' AND I SAID--" WHAT'S THE PUNCH LINE?
"I SAID 'YEHI TAIYO RECAHAMAH.
'"   THAT'S VERY FUNNY, DIMITRI.
HERE'S A GOOD ONE-- "TWO SCOTCHMEN WERE WALKING DOWN THE STREET ONE DAY" MAX GRILLAK.
OH.
THAT LEAVES US WITH JUST ONE  GRILLAK.
GRILLAK, I WANT TO SEE YOUR RIGHT KNEE.
THE ONLY THING THAT CAN SAVE YOU IS IF YOU HAVE A HEART-SHAPED BIRTHMARK ON YOUR RIGHT KNEE.
AHA, JUST AS I THOUGHT-- A HEART-SHAPED BIRTHMARK ON YOUR RIGHT KNEE.
THERE YOU HAVE IT, GENTLEMEN, ANOTHER WONDERFUL THEORY DOWN THE DRAIN.
HOWEVER I THINK I'M ENTITLED TO ONE FREE GUESS.
AND MY GUESS IS THAT IT'S HILLARY GAINSBOROUGH.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, SMART.
I KNOW WHAT HILLARY GAINSBOROUGH LOOKS LIKE.
- HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF PLASTIC SURGERY?
- YOU CAN'T PROVE THAT.
AND IN ANY CASE, FOR THE PAST 15 MINUTES I WAS WITH DEAN WATSON AT 5:15, JUST THE TIME YOU SAY SOMEBODY TRIED TO BLOW YOU UP.
YES, WELL I CHECKED THAT CANDLE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BURN DOWN AND SET OFF THE DYNAMITE, AND THAT CANDLE WAS SET FOR 5:20, WHICH WOULD HAVE GIVEN YOU A PERFECT ALIBI.
AND YOU ACCUSE ME ON THIS FLIMSY EVIDENCE?
NO, I HAVE SOME MORE FLIMSY EVIDENCE.
AHA!
NOTICE, GAINSBOROUGH, YOU CAUGHT IT WITH YOUR LEFT HAND.
THE FIRST ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE WAS MADE BY A LEFT-HANDED KNIFE THROWER.
GRILLAK, ZUKOR AND DIMITRI ARE ALL LEFT HANDED.
YES, BUT THEY HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT ME THEN.
YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNEW THAT I WAS MAXWELL SMART!
ALL RIGHT, SMART!
YOU'VE OUTSMARTED ME.
I-- I CONFESS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE DEAN-- - YOU WHAT?
- I CONFESS.
OH.
TO WHAT?
MAX, HE'S THE IMPOSTOR!
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
ALL RIGHT, MEN, GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
MARVELOUS PIECE OF DEDUCTION, SMART.
AMAZING HOW YOU GOT HILLARY TO CONFESS.
YES, AND IT'S A GOOD THING FOR YOU, DEAN, THAT I DID.
- WHY IS THAT?
- BECAUSE YOU AND I WERE THE ONLY SUSPECTS LEFT.
AND I WAS FAIRLY CERTAIN ABOUT I. - ME.
- YOU?
WHY, I NEVER SUSPECTED YOU FOR A MOMENT, 99.
- NO, I DIDN'T MEAN IN THAT SENSE, MAX.
- SHE MEANT "I" AND "ME".
- YOU TOO?
- NO NO YOU REALLY DID A MARVELOUS JOB, MAX.
THANK YOU, 99.
GO ON, FANG.
GET IN THERE.
I THINK THE CHIEF WILL BE PARTICULARLY PLEASED BECAUSE WE CAPTURED THE KAOS INFILTRATOR.
UH, I'LL DRIVE, FANG, THANK YOU.
COME ON.
AND BEST OF ALL, MAX, THE SECURITY OF OUR ESPIONAGE SCHOOL - HASN'T BEEN VIOLATED.
- THAT'S RIGHT, 99.
AND THERE'S NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN SECURITY.
NOTHING.
WHY, WITHOUT SECURITY NONE OF US WOULD BE SAFE.
EXCUSE ME.
IS THIS MRS.
GREEN'S HOUSE?
NO, THAT'S THE SPY SCHOOL.
MRS.
GREEN'S HOUSE IS OVER THERE.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
COME IN, CONTROL.
THIS IS SMART, MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86.
HELLO, CHIEF; MAX.
I'M STILL FOLLOWING THE DELIVERY TRUCK FROM BOWERS DEPARTMENT STORE.
I THINK HE'S MAKING HIS LAST DELIVERY NOW.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
- HE JUST MADE HIS DELIVERY.
-  I'M GOING TO CHECK IT OUT.
ROGER.
I'M APPROACHING HOUSE NOW.
THERE ARE EIGHT STEPS.
MAKE THAT SEVEN.
CHIEF, I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO HAVE TO BREAK IN.
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME, THE ADDRESS HERE IS 121 LINDEN STREET.
CHIEF, I THINK IS A FRONT.
ALL RIGHT, I GIVE UP.
WHAT ARE THEY DOING?
HOW DO THEY DO IT?
WHAT ARE THEY USING?
WHAT'S THEIR TRICK?
- THE ENEMY AGENTS?
- YES, OF COURSE.
THE EUROPEAN KAOS AGENTS.
HOW ARE THEY SMUGGLING THAT INFORMATION OUT OF THE COUNTRY?
IN MERCHANDISE FROM BOWERS DEPARTMENT STORE.
I KNOW THAT, HODGKINS, BUT IN WHAT MERCHANDISE?
IT'S NOT IN ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES.
IT'S NOT IN FUR COATS.
IT'S NOT IN LEATHER GOODS.
PERHAPS OUR AGENTS PLANTED IN THE DEPARTMENT STORE WILL BE ABLE TO TELL US.
"PERHAPS," HODGKINS?
I CAN'T ACCEPT PERHAPS.
OUR COUNTRY CAN'T ACCEPT PERHAPS.
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT SOME IDLE THREAT HERE.
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROJECT SKYBLAST.
THAT'S THE ARMY'S NEW ANTIMISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM.
OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT IT IS, BUT IT WON'T BE A DEFENSE SYSTEM ANY LONGER IF THE ENEMY KNOWS AS MUCH ABOUT IT AS WE DO.
IF WE DON'T STOP THEM FROM GETTING OUT THAT NEXT MESSAGE, HODGKINS, SKYBLAST GOES DOWN THE DRAIN.
- THAT WOULD BE EMBARRASSING.
- EMBARRASSING?
IT WOULD BE DISASTROUS.
WHERE'S AGENT 86?
WHAT'S HE DOING?
OH, SMART, HE SHOULD BE AT THE DEPARTMENT STORE JUST ABOUT NOW.
ALL RIGHT, FANG, NOW LISTEN AND LISTEN CAREFULLY.
YOU GO OVER THERE BY THAT POST AND KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN.
I'M GOING TO CONTACT AGENT 12.
- AGENT 12.
- YES, 86.
- ACT NATURAL.
- RIGHT.
- ANYTHING NEW TO REPORT?
- BEEN OBSERVING SUSPECT - BELIEVED TO BE ENEMY COURIER.
- WHERE IS HE?
DON'T LOOK NOW.
STANDING NEAR DOORWAY, WEARING PLAID COAT, CARRYING UMBRELLA.
JUST WENT TOWARD MEN'S CLOTHES.
GOOD.
I'D BETTER LEAVE NOW.
THIS MIGHT LOOK SUSPICIOUS.
AGENT 53.
I HAVE JUST CONTACTED AGENT 12.
HE SAYS THAT SUSPECT IN PLAID COAT JUST CAME THIS WAY.
WHICH WAY DID HE GO?
GOOD, CARRY ON.
- 25?
- OVER HERE, 86.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
SUSPECT IN PLAID COAT AND HAT JUST PASSED THIS WAY.
THAT'S RIGHT, 86.
SUSPECT JUST MOVED BEHIND PILLAR, SUSPECT IS CARRYING UMBRELLA.
MAY BE CARRYING INFORMATION RELATING TO ENEMY OPERATIONS.
I AM GOING TO TAKE SUSPECT NOW.
- HOW?
- THE OLD SECRET FRISK METHOD.
HOORAY.
- EXCUSE ME, MADAM.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THIS YOUR POCKET?
SAY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH A-- - OH, POLICE, POLICE, POLICE!
- JUST-- JUST--JUST TAKE IT.
- POLICE, POLICE!
- TAKE IT-- TAKE IT-- TAKE IT EASY.
THIS MAN TRIED TO STEAL MY PURSE.
I'M SORRY I'M LATE, BUT I WAS TIED UP WITH SOME VERY IMPORTANT POLICE BUSINESS.
- NOT NOW.
- BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
- THERE'S A MAN IN A PLAID COAT THAT'S BEEN-- - I KNOW, NOT NOW.
I THINK THEY'RE ONTO ME.
PERHAPS I CAN SHOW YOU SOMETHING - IN ONE OF OUR NEW PERFUMES, SIR.
- WHAT?
CAN I BE OF SOME ASSISTANCE?
I AM MR.
BUNNY, THE MANAGER OF THE STORE.
- I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED SOME HELP.
- OH, MR.
BUNNY, I WAS JUST SHOWING THIS GENTLEMAN SOME OF OUR NEW PERFUMES.
HE EXPRESSED A SPECIAL INTEREST IN OUR NEW JASMINE.
I DID?
OH, YES, YES, OF COURSE I DID.
YES, JASMINE IS REALLY AN INTRIGUING SCENT.
- YES.
-  OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YES, WELL, IT'S QUITE LOVELY, BUT PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME.
I THINK I'LL JUST RUN ALONG NOW.
BUT YOU WILL COME BACK, AND THAT IS JASMINE.
YOU WON'T FORGET?
JASMINE.
I WON'T FORGET.
WELL, GOODBYE, MR.
JASMINE.
- BUNNY.
- OH, YES, BUNNY.
I'M BEING FOLLOWED.
USE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE PLAN Z. TO YOU.
USE EMERGENCY TELEPHONE PLAN Z. - WHAT IS IT, MAX?
- I FORGOT THE NUMBER, CHIEF.
IT'S KLONDIKE 5-9364.
GOT IT.
- KLONDIKE 5-- - NO, I KNOW THE NUMBER, CHIEF.
I DON'T HAVE ANOTHER DIME.
DO YOU HAVE CHANGE FOR A HALF?
THAT'S ONLY 45¢.
- I'LL GET IT SOMEPLACE ELSE.
- KEEP IT, MAX.
I'LL OWE YOU THE NICKEL.
RIGHT.
- YES.
- IS THAT YOU, CHIEF?
OF COURSE IT'S ME.
WHAT IS IT YOU WANT, MAX?
"JASMINE".
WELL, THAT MEANS SHE'S IN TROUBLE.
SHALL WE MOVE IN ON THE STORE?
NO, WE WANT TO GET ALL OF THEM WITH THAT TRANSMITTING DEVICE.
WE CAN'T ALLOW THEM TO GET OUT ONE MORE PIECE OF INFORMATION - ON PROJECT SKYBLAST.
- Right, Chief.
OH, ONE MORE THING.
I'VE GOT A LEAD ON A SUSPECT THAT I THINK YOU MIGHT REMEMBER FROM OUR FILE ON KNOWN KAOS AGENTS.
- CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?
- WELL, I'LL TRY.
HE'S SHORT, HAS DARK HAIR, BROWN EYES, DARK SUIT, VICIOUS UGLY AND HE HAS DIMPLES.
BRILLIANT, MAX, I FEEL AS THOUGH I'M LOOKING RIGHT AT HIM.
YOU ARE.
- ANYTHING ELSE, MAX?
- JUST TWO THINGS.
ONE, I'M GOING BACK TO THE STORE.
AND TWO, DON'T FORGET MY NICKEL.
WHAT ABOUT THE SUSPECT?
OOH, YES, THE SUSPECT.
WELL, THAT'S ALL BEING TAKEN CARE OF, CHIEF.
YOU SEE, IT'S AN EXTENSION OF EMERGENCY TELEPHONE PLAN Z. - AGENT 34 WILL HANDLE IT.
- GOOD.
PARDON ME.
I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO THE YOUNG LADY WHO WAS AT THIS COUNTER EARLIER TODAY.
SHE WAS GOING TO SHOW ME SOMETHING IN NEW PERFUMES.
OH, I AM SORRY.
YOU ARE MISTAKEN.
NO ONE BUT ME HAS WORKED AT THIS COUNTER ALL DAY.
BUT ARE YOU SURE THERE WASN'T A YOUNG LADY WORKING HERE EARLIER?
SHE WAS DEMONSTRATING A PERFUME CALLED JASMINE.
I AM POSITIVE.
PERHAPS IT WAS ANOTHER STORE.
OH, WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
UH, I'LL COME BACK LATER.
MAY I HELP YOU?
PERHAPS IF YOU WOULD COME BACK NEXT WEEK WE WOULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT YOU LIKE MUCH BETTER.
THE GIRL GOT AWAY FROM GORCHECK.
- ARE THE EXITS COVERED?
- YES.
We know she has not left the store, and we have her gun.
IN A FEW MINUTES THE STORE WILL BE CLOSED FOR THE DAY.
WE CAN CONDUCT A COMPLETE SEARCH.
THERE WAS A MAN HERE A MOMENT AGO ASKING FOR HER.
HE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT JASMINE.
JASMINE-- THAT MUST BE THE ONE WHO WAS HERE BEFORE, the one Leopold was following.
WE MUST FIND HIM AND THE GIRL AT ONCE AND LIQUIDATE THEM BOTH.
I THINK THEY'RE ONTO US.
THOSE OTHER THREE CONTROL AGENTS HAVE BEEN TAKEN CARE OF.
NOW FIND THE MAN AND THE GIRL AND DESTROY THEM.
FANG, 99 IS IN DANGER.
WE'VE GOT TO FIND HER BEFORE KAOS DOES.
NOW HERE'S HER GLOVE.
TAKE A SNIFF.
NO, FANG, GIVE IT BACK.
GIVE IT BACK.
OKAY, NOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.
Man on  The store will be closed in five minutes.
- 86.
- FANG, COME OVER HERE.
COME ON.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, 99?
NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE, MAX, AND YOU TOO, FANG.
OH, MAX, I'VE DISCOVERED THEIR SECRET TRANSMITTING DEVICE.
- OH, GOOD, WHAT IS IT?
- THIS.
WATCH.
Hello, my name is Polly Dolly.
I can talk.
I can say many things.
Please feed me.
Now burp me.
WHY, THAT'S FANTASTIC.
WHAT IS SHE TRYING TO TELL US?
WELL, THIS IS THE RECORDING THAT COMES WITH THE DOLL NORMALLY.
BUT MR.
BUNNY SWITCHES TAPE CARTRIDGES FROM SPECIALLY MARKED DOLLS WITH NEW CARTRIDGES CONTAINING THE STOLEN INFORMATION.
THEN THE SPECIAL DOLLS ARE JUST SENT OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
OF COURSE.
AMAZING.
WE'VE GOTTA GET THIS INFORMATION TO CONTROL RIGHT AWAY.
RIGHT.
I'VE BEEN GETTING OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE AND CHANNEL PROBLEMS ON THIS THING.
HELLO, CONTROL, THIS IS 86.
I HAVE VITAL INFORMATION FOR YOU.
COME IN, CONTROL.
-  - YEAH, NOW GET UP.
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
I'M GETTING AN OUTSIDE CHANNEL.
TRY AND FIND OUR WAY OUT OF ONE OF THE EXITS.
The store is now closed.
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE.
WE HAVE LOCKED EVERY DOOR.
I HAVE MEN STATIONED AT EVERY EXIT.
Give yourselves up.
Repeat-- give yourselves up.
WELL, THAT DOES IT.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SHOOT OUR WAY OUT.
WELL, WHAT IF WE DON'T MAKE IT?
WE'VE GOTTA GET THIS INFORMATION BACK TO CONTROL.
- I HAVE AN IDEA.
- WHAT?
FOR THE LAST TIME, GIVE YOURSELVES UP.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THE SPORTS SECTION AND NOTHING IN LINGERIE.
KNOWLEDGE OF THE DOLL TRANSMITTER MUST NOT PASS INTO THE HANDS OF CONTROL.
I GIVE YOU FIVE MINUTES TO FIND THE GIRL.
WE MUST FIND HER.
HE WILL LIQUIDATE US!
THIS VENT IS TOO SMALL FOR EITHER ME OR YOU TO GET THROUGH, 99.
FANG'S THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN DO IT.
FANG, YOU'VE GOTTA TAKE THIS DOLL - AND GET IT TO THE CHIEF.
- TRY IT, FANG.
HERE, TRY IT AGAIN, BOY.
FANG, LIKE THIS.
COME ON, GO GET IT, FANG.
GOOD BOY, FANG.
OKAY, THE INFORMATION'S ON ITS WAY.
NOW WHAT, MAX?
- WELL, I'VE GOT TO FIND ANOTHER WAY OUT OF HERE.
- RIGHT.
- YOU STAY HERE.
- NO, I WANNA GO WITH YOU.
BUT YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE.
OH, MAX.
BEFORE YOU GO, I JUST WANT REMEMBER, COMPLETE SILENCE.
GORCHECK, THEY'RE IN THE MUSIC SECTION.
WE WILL GET THEM.
OH, MAX, THERE'S TOO MUCH LIGHT.
THEY'LL SEE US FOR SURE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WELL, I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.
GOOD SHOOTING, 86.
LOOK, THERE'S ONE MORE.
-  - I'M ALL OUT OF BULLETS.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE LIGHT SWITCH?
- OF COURSE.
THE LIGHT SWITCH!
- GOOD THINKING.
THERE THEY GO, GORCHECK.
-  - WHAT IS IT, K-13?
VERY, VERY GOOD, THANK YOU.
Chief, this is Maxwell Smart, Agent 86.
The spies have been using these dolls to transmit stolen information by substituting their own tape cartridges.
99 and I are at the store, and it looks like we're in for it.
HODGKINS, I WANT EVERY AVAILABLE AGENT READY TO MOVE OUT ON THE DOUBLE.
That's it, Chief.
Now burp me.
SHH!
IT'S MR.
BUNNY.
FINGERS CROSSED.
I'M GOING TO TRY A BIG BLUFF.
ALL RIGHT, DON'T ANYBODY MOVE.
IF I GO, YOUR BOSS GOES WITH ME.
SO THERE YOU ARE.
I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO HAS PLACED OUR MAGNIFICENT PLAN IN JEOPARDY.
SMART, MAXWELL SMART.
OH, THE FAMOUS MAXWELL SMART.
I AM CONRAD BUNNY.
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
THE INFAMOUS HERR BUNNY.
- DO YOU KNOW 99?
- NOT OFFICIALLY.
THE INFAMOUS CONRAD BUNNY.
- BUNNY, 99.
- HOW DO YOU DO?
PLEASED TO MAKE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE, FRAULEIN.
OH, WE CAN USE MR.
BUNNY TO GET US OUT OF HERE.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, - I'D LIKE TO HANDLE THIS MYSELF.
- RIGHT.
MR.
BUNNY, WE'RE GOING TO USE YOU TO GET US OUT OF HERE.
YOU ARE GOING NO PLACE, MR.
SMART.
I AM SIMPLY AMUSING MYSELF AT YOUR EXPENSE.
I KNOW YOUR GUN IS EMPTY.
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO BET YOUR LIFE ON IT?
I'M GLAD YOU DIDN'T BET, MR.
BUNNY, BECAUSE YOU SEE, YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE BEEN RIGHT.
THIS GUN IS EMPTY.
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER GUN.
ANOTHER BLUFF, MR.
SMART?
GET THEM!
THEY ARE UNARMED.
GORCHECK, FRIEDA, WHERE ARE YOU?
COME HELP ME FIND MY MONOCLE.
OH, I AM HELPLESS WITHOUT MY MONOCLE.
- FIND IT, FIND IT!
-  - WHAT WAS THAT?
- I FOUND IT.
DON'T JUST STAND THERE, YOU FOOLS.
GO AND LOOK FOR THEM!
OH, IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE IN BIG TROUBLE, MAX.
I KNOW.
I'M OUT OF WATER.
OH, THEY MISSED US, BUT IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL THEY FIND US HERE.
I THINK OUR BEST PLAN IS TO TRY TO GET BACK TO THE MUSIC SECTION AND SEE IF WE CAN SNEAK THROUGH THE VENT.
WHAT IF THEY SPOT US?
WELL, THEN MY PLAN IS THIS-- I'LL ACT AS DECOY, LEAD THEM IN ONE DIRECTION, AND YOU GO THROUGH THE VENT.
OH, MAX, WHAT ABOUT YOU?
THEY'VE GOT GUNS.
WELL, IF I DON'T MAKE IT, 99, - I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING FOR ME.
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
THE CHIEF OWES ME A NICKEL.
I'D LIKE YOU TO HAVE IT.
- OH, MAX.
- SHH!
NOW'S OUR CHANCE.
UNLESS I MISS MY GUESS, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE WE ARE.
-  -  OKAY, 99, YOUR TURN TO GUESS.
MAX, LOOK OUT!
IF ONLY THESE THINGS WOULD WORK.
- HEY!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?
USE YOUR GUN!
PICK UP YOUR PISTOL.
SHOOT, SHOOT!
KEEP FIRING, 99.
I THINK WE GOT 'EM!
STAND UP, YOU COWARDS!
SHOOT, SHOOT!
"DESTRUCTO, THE TOY MANUFACTURER'S ULTIMATE WEAPON".
THEY ARE USING DESTRUCTO!
MAX!
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.
NO, 99, THE REAL CREDIT BELONGS TO THESE TOYS.
AFTER ALL, WE HAD AT OUR DISPOSAL EVERY FIENDISH AND DESTRUCTIVE PLAYTHING EVER DEVISED FOR THE PLEASURE OF LITTLE CHILDREN.
THOSE POOR DEVILS, ALL THEY HAD WERE REAL GUNS AND BULLETS.
YOU DID A FINE JOB, MAX.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE THEM IN.
AFTER YOU, HERR BUNNY.
- WATCH OUT, MAX!
- NO ONE MOVE!
DON'T BE A FOOL, HERR BUNNY.
YOU CAN'T GET OUT OF HERE.
I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ESCAPE, MR.
SMART, BUT AT LEAST I CAN TAKE ONE OF YOU WITH ME.
- WHICH SHALL IT BE?
LEAVE THE GIRL OUT OF THIS.
NO, MAX, YOU'RE MORE IMPORTANT.
- IF YOU'RE GONNA SHOOT SOMEONE, SHOOT ME.
- DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO HER.
EVEN A RAT LIKE YOU COULDN'T SHOOT DOWN A GIRL IN COLD BLOOD.
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW, MR.
SMART.
- I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THIS MOMENT FOREVER.
- NO!
-  - OH, MAX!
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
YES, WHO IS IT?
DR.
CARL HASKELL.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
- PLEASE, I MUST SPEAK TO YOU.
SHUT THE DOOR PLEASE.
YOU ARE MAXWELL SMART, SECRET AGENT 86?
PERHAPS.
YOU'RE DR.
CARL HASKELL THE PHYSICIST, AREN'T YOU?
YES.
I THOUGHT I'D BE FRANK WITH YOU.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
AS I RECALL, DR.
HASKELL, YOU WERE WORKING ON A TOP-SECRET PROJECT - FOR OUR GOVERNMENT AND SUDDENLY-- - YES, SUDDENLY I DISAPPEARED.
THEY SAY YOU DEFECTED TO THE ENEMY.
I WAS TAKEN PRISONER, KIDNAPPED - BY-- BY KAOS.
- KAOS?
YES, OF COURSE, THE INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF EVIL.
WELL, I'VE DEALT WITH THEM BEFORE.
- THEY LET YOU GO?
- NO, I ESCAPED, BUT NOT BEFORE THEY FORCED ME TO TURN OVER TO THEM THE RESULTS OF MY MOST SECRET EXPERIMENT - YES, GO ON, DOCTOR.
- I INVENTED A GUN WHOSE RAY CAN TURN A MAN INVISIBLE.
KAOS NOW HAS IT IN THEIR POSSESSION.
DO YOU REALIZE THE IMPLICATIONS?
YES OF COURSE, BUT I FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THAT I HAVE THE PLANS AND DESIGNS OF THAT GUN HERE WITH ME, IN THIS BRIEFCASE?
YOU CAN TURN THEM OVER TO YOUR GOVERNMENT, BUT MEANTIME I MUST BE PROTECTED.
YES, WELL, DR.
HASKELL, NOW THAT YOU ARE HERE I'M SURE THAT YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
STAND STILL, GENTLEMEN.
IF EITHER OF YOU MOVES - THE DOCTOR WILL DIE.
- WHO SAID THAT?
- I DID.
- IT'S KAOS.
THEY FOUND ME!
- NOW LISTEN, WHOEVER YOU ARE-
DON'T MOVE, SMART.
THERE ARE TWO OF US HERE.
IF YOU TRY ANYTHING I WILL SHOOT YOU AND MY ASSOCIATE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR.
THAT'S RIGHT.
- OH!
YOU'RE BREAKING MY ARM!
COME ON, DOCTOR.
YOU'RE COMING BACK WITH US.
BRING THE BRIEFCASE, HASKELL.
-  OPEN THE DOOR.
RIGHT.
BEFORE WE LEAVE YOU, A LITTLE SOMETHING TO REMEMBER US BY, MR.
SMART.
LET ME GIVE YOU A MESSAGE FOR YOUR GOVERNMENT.
YOU CAN HAVE THE PLANS FOR THE INVISIBILITY RAY FOR $10 MILLION.
IF YOU DON'T WANT IT, THERE ARE OTHER NATIONS WHO WILL.
STOP THEM!
THEN THE GUN WENT OFF, I GOT HIT ON THE FACE BY A PUFF OF SMOKE, AND I CAME TO MAX, I DON'T MEAN TO SUGGEST THAT YOU ARE NOT TELLING THE TRUTH, BUT ISN'T IT JUST CONCEIVABLE THAT THIS WHOLE AFFAIR - COULD HAVE BEEN A BAD DREAM?
- ABSOLUTELY NOT, CHIEF.
I TELL YOU, I SAW TWO INVISIBLE MEN.
UH, THAT IS, I DIDN'T SEE TWO INVISIBLE MEN.
WHAT I MEAN TO SAY IS I SAW TWO MEN WHO WERE NOT IN MY APARTMENT WHO WERE THERE.
MAX, THINK WHAT YOU'RE ASKING ME TO BELIEVE.
IT'S SCIENCE FICTION.
IT'S A FANTASY.
YES, BUT THIS ISN'T.
"OUR REPRESENTATIVE WILL BE AT YOUR APARTMENT TONIGHT.
IF THE MONEY IS NOT READY WE WILL BE GLAD TO SELL THE SECRET TO YOUR COUNTRY'S ENEMIES".
SIGNED-- I CAN'T MAKE OUT THE SIGNATURE.
IT'S INVISIBLE.
ALL RIGHT, MAX.
IT'S INCONCEIVABLE, BUT IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING WORLD WHO KNOWS?
HAVE THE BOYS FROM THE LAB GO TO SMART'S APARTMENT AND TELL AGENT 99 TO MEET ME THERE.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO, CHIEF?
YOU'D BETTER WRITE DOWN THESE INSTRUCTIONS.
- WE'VE GOT TO BE PRECISE.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
FIRST OF ALL, PLAN "A"-- IF THEY DO SHOW UP WITHOUT THE RAY GUN-- HOLD ON A SECOND, CHIEF, YOU GOT A PIECE OF PAPER?
- YEAH.
- THANK YOU.
IF THEY SHOW UP AT YOUR APARTMENT WITHOUT THE RAY GUN - YOU'VE GOT TO FORCE THEM-- - JUST A MINUTE, CHIEF, DO YOU HAVE A PENCIL?
- I THINK SO.
- THANK YOU.
IF THEY SHOW UP AT YOUR APARTMENT WITHOUT THE RAY GUN YOU'VE GOT TO FORCE THEM TO TAKE YOU TO THEIR HIDEOUT AND FIND A WAY TO CONFISCATE THE WEAPON.
YOU GOT THAT?
"PLAN 'A'".
I HAVE A FEELING THIS IS GOING TO TAKE TOO LONG.
"I HAVE A FEELING" COME ON, MAX.
COME ON, MAX.
NOW IF THEY SHOW UP WITH THE RAY GUN WE PUT PLAN "B" INTO EFFECT.
"TAKE TOO LONG".
NEVER MIND THAT.
JUST LISTEN.
IF THEY HAVE THE RAY GUN YOU STRIKE A MATCH AT THAT WINDOW.
WHEN YOU STRIKE THAT MATCH IT WILL BE A SIGNAL FOR US TO MOVE IN FOR THE CAPTURE.
WHAT IF THEY TRY TO TAKE A SHOT OF ME?
IF THEY SHOULD DO THAT YOU'LL BE PROTECTED BY DOING THIS.
THE BOYS FROM OUR LAB INSTALLED IT EARLIER TODAY.
APPLYING PRESSURE TO THE EDGE OF THIS DESK WILL LOWER AN INVISIBLE WALL THAT NOTHING CAN PENETRATE.
ONE QUESTION, CHIEF-- IF THE WALL IS INVISIBLE, - THEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S UP OR DOWN?
-  THAT'S ONE WAY.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.
- YOU CAN'T EVEN TELL IT'S THERE.
-  HOW DO YOU RAISE IT?
BY LEANING ON THE DESK AGAIN.
NOW IF THEY SHOULD TRY TO KILL YOU THIS INVISIBLE WALL WILL SERVE TO PREVENT YOUR HARM SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
AT WHICH TIME THEY WILL UNDOUBTEDLY RETURN TO THEIR HIDEOUT - TO REPORT THE INCIDENT.
- AND THAT'S WHEN I FOLLOW THEM, RIGHT?
- WRONG.
- WRONG.
IN THAT CASE FROM ACROSS THE COURT AND SHE WILL FOLLOW THEM.
I DON'T THINK THEY'D BE SUSPICIOUS OF A WOMAN.
BUT WHAT IF THEIR HIDEOUT IS IN THE Y.M.C.A.
?
THEN SHE'LL CALL YOU.
I'M NOT A MEMBER.
MAX, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING FOR A HEADACHE?
YOU KNOW, CHIEF, YOU WANT TO GO AND HAVE A CHECK-UP.
YOU'VE BEEN GETTING THESE HEADACHES OFTEN LATELY.
ONLY ON OCCASIONS, MAX.
WELL, YOU'VE HAD ONE EVERY TIME I'VE BEEN WITH YOU.
THOSE ARE THE OCCASIONS.
- AH, AH.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- DON'T DO THAT, CHIEF.
- WHY NOT?
WELL, YOU SEE I HAPPEN TO HAVE A FEW PROTECTIVE DEVICES OF MY OWN.
THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
NOW I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.
HERE, YOU HOLD THE GLASS.
HOLD IT OUT THERE.
NOW WATCH.
- VERY INGENIOUS, MAX.
- OH, THAT'S NOTHING, CHIEF.
WAIT TILL YOU GET A LOAD OF THIS ONE.
NOW WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I TURN THIS LAMP ON WITHOUT USING THE SAFETY SWITCH.
ANYONE RIFLING THE DRAWERS IS GONNA END UP WITH QUITE A STOMACHACHE.
- ANYTHING ELSE?
- WELL, IF YOU LIKED THAT YOU'LL GET A BIG KICK OUT OF THIS, CHIEF.
I'VE GOT A SPECIAL MANTRAP OPERATED FROM THIS COUCH.
- MANTRAP?
- YES.
- YOU SEE THAT NET UP THERE?
- YEAH.
WELL, YOU MERELY PRESS THIS BUTTON HERE-- NO NO, MAX, THANK YOU.
I'VE SEEN ENOUGH.
WHERE DO YOU GET THE IDEAS FOR ALL THESE DEVICES?
I'VE GOT THIS FUNNY LITTLE DECORATOR, YOU SEE.
- WHAT IS THAT?
- OH, NOW THAT REALLY IS SENSATIONAL, CHIEF.
STAND ASIDE AND I'LL SHOW YOU HOW IT WORKS.
LEND ME YOUR HAT.
OKAY NOW, WHEN I DROP THIS HAT, YOU PULL THE KNOB.
YOU READY?
- READY.
- OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE, GO.
OKAY, YOU CAN TURN IT OFF NOW, CHIEF.
- WHAT?
- TURN IT OFF.
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
IT'S AMAZING.
WHAT IS IT?
SOME KIND OF A FAN?
YES, IT IS SOME KIND OF A FAN.
IF SOMEBODY STANDS THERE AND THREATENS ME WITH A GUN I MERELY PULL OUT THE KNOB, AND THE GUN IS SUCKED UP THROUGH THE CHIMNEY.
IT TOOK ME MONTHS TO MAKE IT PERFECT.
- WHERE IS MY HAT, MAX?
- ALMOST PERFECT.
- WHERE'S MY HAT?
- WELL, I WOULD SAY IT'S ABOUT 14th STREET AND AVENUE "N" - WHAT?
- ACCORDING TO THE WIND VELOCITY - AND THE DENSITY OF THE HAT.
- SMART!
THAT MUST BE 99, CHIEF.
- HELLO, 86.
- HELLO, 99.
- GOOD EVENING, CHIEF.
- HELLO, 99.
THE PLAN AND YOUR DUTIES.
- I'M COUNTING ON YOU.
- GOOD, CHIEF.
NOW, 86, REMEMBER, IF THEY HAVE THE RAY GUN, A MATCH STRUCK IN THAT WINDOW WILL BRING US RUNNING.
IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE RAY GUN AND IF YOU CAN'T CONVINCE THEM TO TAKE YOU WITH THEM TO THEIR HIDEOUT, IF THEY DO TAKE YOU WITH THEM, 99 WILL FOLLOW.
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?
- GOOD LUCK, MAX.
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
OH!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
- UH, 99?
- YES, 86?
THERE ARE CERTAIN SECRET DEVICES THAT HAVE BEEN INSTALLED IN THIS APARTMENT WHICH I SHALL NOW DEMONSTRATE FOR YOU.
- MAX.
- THIS IS ONE OF THEM.
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT YOU CAME HERE WITHOUT THE INVISIBLE RAY GUN AND YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE THAT SUCH A SILLY GUN EXIST?
WELL, GENTLEMEN, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SHOW ME.
- YOU SEE, I'M FROM MINNESOTA.
- YOU MEAN MISSOURI.
MISSOURI.
DON'T TELL ME WHERE I'M FROM.
THE KAOS AGENTS HAVE JUST ENTERED MAX'S APARTMENT, CHIEF.
IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE THEY DIDN'T EVEN BRING THE RAY GUN WITH THEM.
NOW MAX IS STALLING.
HE'S TRYING TO GET AS MUCH INFORMATION AS HE CAN.
GENTLEMEN, I'M AFRAID THAT YOUR GUNS ARE USELESS.
YOU SEE, THERE'S AN INVISIBLE WALL BETWEEN US.
GO AHEAD, SHOOT.
THE BULLETS WILL MERELY BOUNCE OFF.
YOU'LL SIMPLY BE WASTING YOUR AMMUNITION.
NOW I DON'T CARE TO DISCUSS IT ANY FURTHER.
UNLESS OF COURSE WE DISCUSS IT AT YOUR PLACE.
THE KAOS AGENTS ARE TAKING MAX TO THEIR HIDEOUT, CHIEF.
I'M GONNA HANG UP NOW AND FOLLOW THEM.
I'LL CHECK IN LATER.
OH, DON'T WORRY, I'LL BE CAREFUL.
WELCOME, MR.
SMART.
SO GOOD OF YOU TO COME.
MY NAME IS EHRLICH.
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET SOME OF MY ASSOCIATES.
COLONEL VON KRUEGER.
- WIE GEHT'S?
- DANKE.
AND DR.
E.K. GAMBINI.
PIACERE, SIGNOR SMART.
WELCOME TO OUR HUMBLE HIDEOUT.
BUONGIORNO.
NOW WHAT'S ALL THIS TOMMYROT ABOUT INVISIBILITY?
THERE'S NOBODY THERE.
ON THE CONTRARY, THEY ARE VERY MUCH THERE.
JUST INVISIBLE.
PLEASE, MR.
SMART, SIT DOWN.
IS THERE ANYBODY THERE?
SOPHIE, OFFER OUR GUEST A CIGARETTE.
SOPHIE?
CIGARETTE, MR.
SMART?
YES.
THANK YOU.
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT, JUST ASK.
PERHAPS SIGNOR SMART WOULD LIKE SOME WINE.
A SPLENDID SUGGESTION.
I'LL CHOSE IT MYSELF.
EXCUSE ME.
NOW THAT WE ARE ALONE I WANT TO GIVE YOU A LAST CHANCE TO GIVE YOURSELVES UP.
THERE'S STILL TIME FOR YOU TO TAKE YOUR PLACE IN SOCIETY AS NORMAL, DECENT, INVISIBLE MEN AND WOMEN.
EXCELLENT!
EXCELLENT!
YOUR WIRE-PULLING IS PRECISE.
AND YOUR VOICES ARE SUPERB.
KEEP IT UP!
THE LIGHTING IS PERFECT.
THE WIRES CAN HARDLY BE SEEN EVEN BY ME.
KRUEGER AND GAMBINI, YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS MAD SCHEME.
WOULD YOU LIKE SOME HORS D'OEUVRES, MR.
SMART?
YES, SOPHIE, AS A MATTER OF FACT I WOULD.
NOW LISTEN, SOPHIE, IF YOU'LL TURN OVER THE RING ONTO ME I'LL SEE THAT YOU GET OFF LIGHTLY.
HOW ABOUT IT?
HERE ARE YOUR HORS D'OEUVRES, MR.
SMART.
WELL, THE LEAST YOU COULD DO IS WEAR A STRONG PERFUME, SOPHIE.
DID YOU SAY SOMETHING, MR.
SMART?
HERE WE ARE.
WE'LL HAVE SOME WINE AND THEN SETTLE ALL THE BUSINESS.
SOPHIE, SOME GLASSES, PLEASE.
WATCH OUT!
WATCH OUT!
- WHO CAME IN?
- UH AHA.
VERY CLEVER, MR.
EHRLICH, BUT NOT QUITE CLEVER ENOUGH.
YOU HAD ME FOOLED FOR A WHILE, BUT NOW I'M WISE TO YOU.
THERE IS NO SOPHIE AND THERE IS NO GAMBINI.
- THERE ISN'T?
- NO, BECAUSE COLONEL KRUEGER OVER THERE IS A VENTRILOQUIST.
COME COME, MR.
SMART.
TELL ME WHERE IS THE MONEY?
THERE'LL BE NO MONEY, MR.
EHRLICH, NOT UNTIL I'M FIRMLY CONVINCED.
SO FAR I HAVEN'T RECEIVED ONE SHRED OF EVIDENCE THAT A RAY GUN EXISTS THAT CAN MAKE PEOPLE INVISIBLE.
Gambini: WHAT ABOUT US, SIGNOR SMART?
YES, WELL, YOU COULD HAVE BEEN BORN INVISIBLE.
EHRLICH!
SHOW HIM THE RAY GUN.
- BUT - DO AS I SAY!
ALL RIGHT.
THERE IT IS, MR.
SMART.
AHA.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
VERY SIMPLY.
THIS DIAL GOVERNS THE INTENSITY OF THE RAY, THIS DIAL GOVERNS THE DURATION OF THE INVISIBILITY, LET'S SAY FIVE MINUTES.
THEN ONE TURNS THAT DIAL AND IT'S ON.
- SIMPLE, ISN'T IT?
- YES, I SUPPOSE SO, AS FAR AS RAY GUNS GO.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT ON ME, EHRLICH?
THEN MAYBE I MIGHT BELIEVE YOU.
OH NO, MR.
SMART.
WE ARE NOT AS FOOLISH AS THAT.
OH, HOW FOOLISH ARE YOU?
IF I TURN THE RAY ON YOU-- PRESTO-- YOU DISAPPEAR, WE LOSE A VALUABLE PRISONER.
- SOPHIE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WHAT?
OH!
ARGH!
AHA.
A LOW TRICK, EHRLICH, BUT IT WORKED.
NOW I'M AS INVISIBLE AS THE REST OF YOU.
NOW I HAVE THE UPPER HAND.
BUT I CAN SEE MY UPPER HAND.
AND I CAN SEE MY LOWER HAND.
WHY, I CAN SEE ALL OF ME.
EHRLICH, THE RAY GUN WAS A PHONY AND SO ARE YOU.
WELL Gambini: OF COURSE YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF, SIGNOR SMART.
WE CAN ALL SEE OURSELVES, BUT NOBODY ELSE CAN SEE US.
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONLY YOU CAN SEE YOURSELF, MR.
SMART, WHEREVER YOU ARE.
Gambini: DON'T LET HIM ESCAPE.
Sophie's: DON'T LEAVE ME, MR.
SMART.
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT TOGETHER.
NO, LEAVE ME ALONE.
WHAT IS SHE DOING HERE, YOU FOOL?
- SHE GOT AWAY.
- DON'T WORRY, 99, IT'S ME, MAX, MAX.
I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOU.
YOU ARE PERFECTLY SAFE.
EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN'T SEE ME, I'LL PROTECT YOU.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I CAN SEE YOU.
YES, OF COURSE.
YOU CAN SEE ME, BUT I CAN'T SEE MYSELF.
NO, WAIT A MINUTE.
I CAN SEE MYSELF, BUT YOU CAN'T-- MYSELF-- I-- WAIT RIGHT HERE.
HOW DOES THAT GO AGAIN, EHRLICH?
- I CAN SEE MYSELF-- - ENOUGH.
YOU HAD TO LET HER ESCAPE.
OUT OUT!
ALL RIGHT, MR.
SMART.
NOW YOU REALIZE THIS WHOLE THING IS A HOAX-- THAT WE HAVE NO INVISIBILITY RAY GUN, THAT THERE IS NO GAMBINI, - NO KRUEGER-- - OF COURSE!
SOPHIE IS THE VENTRILOQUIST.
I WAS THE VENTRILOQUIST, MR.
SMART.
OBVIOUSLY, THEY'VE BEEN DECEIVING YOU, MAX.
YES, BUT FORTUNATELY I FOUND OUT JUST IN TIME.
WHY, THEY'VE BEEN USING WIRES AND A LOUDSPEAKER SYSTEM.
- EXACTLY, MR.
SMART.
- YOU HAVE?
- WHAT ABOUT HASKELL?
- HE'S OUR ASSOCIATE.
OH.
BUT MY APARTMENT.
HOW DID YOU ARRANGE MY APARTMENT?
JUST THIS BRIEFCASE, MR.
SMART, WITH BUILT-IN STEREO SPEAKERS, WITH A PRERECORDED TAPES OF THE VOICES OF MY INVISIBLE COMPANIONS.
Man's voice: I'LL SHOOT YOU AND MY ASSOCIATE WILL TAKE CARE OF THE DOCTOR.
- Man #2: THAT'S RIGHT.
- BUT THE GUN, HOW DID YOU MANAGE THE GUN?
WATCH.
YOU LOOK CLOSELY, MR.
SMART.
YOU CAN SEE THE WIRES THAT ATTACH THE GUN TO A CONTROL MECHANISM WHICH I OPERATE.
BUT I CAN SEE THOSE WIRES PERFECTLY.
NOW YOU CAN SEE THEM, BUT LATE AT NIGHT WHEN THE LIGHTS ARE LOW AND YOU ARE OPEN TO SUGGESTION BECAUSE YOU ARE TIRED, VERY TIRED-- ENOUGH!
ALL RIGHT, MR.
SMART, TELL US WHERE IS THE MONEY.
WELL, EHRLICH, YOU LEAVE ME NO CHOICE.
I SUPPOSE WE'LL HAVE TO TAKE YOU TO MY APARTMENT.
CONTROL IS SCHEDULED TO CALL ME THERE AT EXACTLY 9:00 P.M. NOW IF THEY ARE ASSURED THAT 99 AND I ARE PERFECTLY SAFE, THEN AND ONLY THEN WILL THEY REVEAL WHERE THE MONEY IS PLANTED.
LET'S GO, MR.
SMART.
LET'S GO.
ALL RIGHT, SMART, THAT PHONE HAD BETTER START RINGING.
IT'S TWO MINUTES UNTIL 9:00.
OH, IS IT THAT LATE?
NO WONDER I'M SO HUNGRY.
SAY, I'VE GOT A GREAT IDEA.
THERE IS A LITTLE CHINESE RESTAURANT - ABOUT THREE BLOCKS FROM HERE.
- LOOK AROUND, HASKELL.
- I'M GOING TO GIVE THE SIGNAL NOW.
- WHAT ARE YOU WHISPERING ABOUT?
OH, I WAS JUST TELLING 99 THAT I WAS GOING TO HAVE A CIGARETTE.
ANYBODY GOT A LIGHT?
ANYBODY GOT SOME FLINT?
HASKELL, WHAT TIME IS IT?
ONE AND A HALF MINUTES TO 9:00.
KEEP LOOKING AT YOUR WATCH.
I WANT TO KNOW EXACTLY WHEN TO KILL MR.
SMART.
MAX, WHILE WE'RE WAITING, WHY DON'T WE ALL HAVE A LITTLE DRINK?
NO, I'M NOT THIRSTY, 99.
OH, MAX YES, THAT MIGHT BE A GOOD IDEA.
MR.
EHRLICH, HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SCOTCH?
I THINK PERHAPS I WILL.
THERE YOU ARE.
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE SODA?
OH YES.
OR PERHAPS NOT.
HEY.
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO LIKE THAT.
IT'S A REAL PEPPER-UPPER.
ONE MINUTE TO GO.
DOES HE HAVE TO KEEP GIVING THE TIME?
TIME IS RUNNING OUT, MR.
SMART.
MAX, MAYBE MR.
EHRLICH COULD USE A LITTLE MORE LIGHT.
HUH?
IT SEEMS A LITTLE DARK OVER HERE BY THE DESK.
AHEM.
YES.
THE DESK.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I WAS JUST GOING TO MAKE THE ROOM A LITTLE MORE CHEERFUL.
JUST DON'T TRY ANYTHING, SMART.
Haskell: THERE GOES BIG BEN AGAIN.
PRESS THE BUTTON.
THE BUTTON OF THE THING-- - OH!
- THE BUTTON.
MR.
EHRLICH, HOW ABOUT A REFILL?
YES, I THINK I WILL.
ALL RIGHT, MR.
SMART, THAT NET WAS MEANT FOR ME.
- WHAT NET?
- THAT NET.
A CLUMSY TRAP THAT DIDN'T WORK.
FUNNY YOU SHOULD PUT IT THAT WAY.
SMART, YOUR TIME IS UP.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, EHRLICH.
HASKELL OVER HERE IS THE TIMEKEEPER.
HASKELL, WHAT TIME IS IT?
- 9:00.
- OKAY, MY TIME IS UP.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, GENTLEMEN.
YOU WIN.
I LIED ABOUT THE PHONE CALL.
THE MONEY HAS BEEN HERE ALL THE TIME.
- WHERE?
- WELL, I'LL TAKE YOU TO IT.
- IT'S IN THE CHIMNEY.
- I'LL GET IT MYSELF.
I DON'T THINK HE TRUSTS ME, HASKELL.
JUST IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY MORE OF YOUR CLUMSY TRICKS.
A FIREPLACE IS AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO HIDE WEAPONS.
HERE, KEEP HIM COVERED.
SIT DOWN, SMART.
-  -  - GOOD WORK, 86!
- THANK YOU, 99.
WELL, WE'VE CAPTURED EHRLICH AND HASKELL, WE'VE SAVED THE GOVERNMENT $10 MILLION, AND WE'VE BEATEN KAOS AGAIN.
THAT'S RIGHT, 99, BUT THERE'S ONE THING THAT REALLY MAKES ME HAPPY.
- WHAT'S THAT, 86?
- I THINK EHRLICH'S HAT WILL JUST FIT THE CHIEF.
WELL, THAT JUST ABOUT WRAPS IT UP, 99.
HASKELL AND EHRLICH ARE ON THEIR WAY TO PRISON, THE CHIEF LIKES EHRLICH'S HAT, AND ONCE AGAIN THE FORCES OF VIRTUE HAVE TRIUMPHED OVER THE FORCES OF ROTTENNESS.
MAX, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF THE CHIMNEY FAN HADN'T WORKED?
AH, I STILL HAD ONE ACE UP MY SLEEVE, 99.
- YOU SEE THIS CHAIR OVER HERE?
- UH-HUH.
WELL, INSIDE THIS CHAIR IS A DEVICE WHICH WHEN ACTIVATED RELEASES A HIGHLY POTENT SLEEPING GAS.
THAT'S MARVELOUS.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
WELL, IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE, 99.
YOU MERELY TAKE BOTH HANDS AND PRESS THEM DOWN ON THE ARMS OF THE CHAIR.
THEN YOU TAKE BOTH FEET AND PRESS THEM ON THE FLOOR, WHILE PUSHING BACK AGAINST THIS CUSHION, AT THE SAME TIME RELEASING A SWITCH BEHIND THIS TABLE.
THEN THE GAS COMES OUT OF THE VENTILATING SYSTEM.
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.
SEE?
THERE IT IS.
OH.
OH, MAX.
- OH.
- I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE DOOR.
I THINK WE CAN MAKE IT TO THE FLOOR.
{END OF EPISODE 05}{START OF EPISODE 06}
WHAT'S A MATTER WITH YOU GUYS?
NUTS OR SOMETHING?
CAN'T YOU MOTION PICTURE PEOPLE STAY ON YOUR OWN SETS?
- THIS IS A PUBLIC HIGHWAY.
-  WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
EVERYBODY LINE UP.
ONE OF YOU IS SECRET AGENT OF CONTROL.
THAT IS MAN WE WANT.
ALL OTHERS WE WILL KILL.
WILL CONTROL AGENT TAKE ONE STEP FORWARD?
THAT IS MAN WE WANT.
TAKE HIM.
CONTROL AGENT WOULD NOT REVEAL IDENTITY EVEN ON THREAT OF DEATH.
EVERYBODY ELSE BACK IN BUS.
WE HAVE MESSAGE FOR YOU TO TAKE TO YOUR LEADERS.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE JUST HANDED IT TO ME?
YOU WILL TAKE IT TO YOUR GOVERNMENT AT ONCE.
- HYAH!
-  - WHAT'S IT SAY?
- TOP SECRET.
HOW FAR TO A TELEPHONE?
TWO, MAYBE THREE HOURS.
OKAY, LET'S GO.
THIS IS AGENT 43.
I'M IN ARIZONA.
My tri-state bus was just attacked by a band of Indians.
YOUR BUS WAS ATTACKED BY INDIANS?
Yes, Indians.
ARE YOU SURE?
WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE?
THEY WORE FEATHERS, WAR PAINT AND CARRIED BOWS AND ARROWS.
YES, THOSE WERE INDIANS.
INDIAN UPRISING IN THE 20th CENTURY?
IT'S TRUE.
I WAS JUST STARTING MY THREE-WEEK VACATION WHEN MY BUS WAS ATTACKED BY FOUR INDIANS ON HORSEBACK.
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
You can't believe what?
YOU'VE GOT A THREE-WEEKS VACATION?
THEY GAVE ME THIS  "INFORM YOUR GOVERNMENT THAT THEY HAVE 48 HOURS TO TURN OVER ALL LANDS APPROPRIATED FROM OUR PEOPLE-- OTHERWISE, WAR".
- WAR?
- That's what it says.
HANG ON, 43.
THIS IS A MAXIMUM ALERT.
REPEAT, THIS IS A MAXIMUM ALERT.
FORSYTH, WAKE UP THE CHIEF AND TELL HIM IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
HARRISON, CALL THE PENTAGON AND ALERT THE CHIEFS OF STAFF.
SAUNDERS, CANCEL ALL MILITARY LEAVES AND HOLD INTERSTATE COMMERCE.
AND, OH, SAUNDERS, JUST BETWEEN YOU AND ME, HOW MANY WEEKS VACATION DID YOU GET LAST YEAR?
THREE?
- WHAT IS IT, 86?
- A MAXIMUM MOBILIZATION ALERT, CHIEF.
THREAT OF WAR BY A KNOWN AGGRESSOR.
WAR?
GOOD HEAVENS, IS IT THE CHINESE?
THE RUSSIANS?
- WELL THEN WHO?
- THE INDIANS.
INDIANS?
BUT INDIA IS A NEUTRALIST NATION.
NO, NOT THOSE INDIANS, CHIEF.
THE AMERICAN INDIANS.
THE AMERICAN INDIANS?
- THOSE INDIANS?
- YES, SIR.
FOUR OF THEM, THEY ATTACKED A BUS.
MAX, YOU DON'T MEAN-- YOU COULDN'T-- YOU WOULDN'T CALL UP-- SAY YOU DIDN'T, MAX.
YOU DID.
MAX, DO YOU REALIZE WHAT YOU'VE DONE ON THE STRENGTH OF A MINOR INCIDENT?
YOU WOKE UP THE THREE HIGHEST RANKING OFFICERS IN THE U.S. MILITARY.
YOU'VE GOT HUNDREDS OF PLANES FLYING IN THE AIR.
YOU'VE CANCELED THOUSANDS OF LEAVES.
THAT'S WHAT YOU'VE DONE, MAX.
JUST WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, CHIEF?
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD SUMMON THE CHIEFS OF STAFF AT THIS AWFUL HOUR SIMPLY BECAUSE THREE INDIANS ATTACKED A BUS.
FOUR, CHIEF.
DO YOU REALIZE WHAT TIME IT IS?
IT'S 3:00 IN THE MORNING.
- WHAT'S THIS ALL ABOUT?
- NOBODY TOLD ME ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
- SORRY ABOUT THIS, GENTLEMEN.
- MY TROOPS ARE AT MAXIMUM ALERT.
ALREADY IN THE AIR.
I'VE RECALLED THE THIRD AND SEVENTH FLEETS.
WELL, IT'S REALLY NOTHING.
All: NOTHING!
YOU TELL 'EM, 86.
UH, VERY WELL.
GENTLEMAN, FIRST OF ALL-- JUST A MINUTE, SOMEONE SEEMS TO BE MISSING.
WHERE IS THE MARINE CORPS COMMANDANT?
HE'S ON VACATION FOR THREE WEEKS.
THREE WEEKS?
GET ON WITH IT, 86.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
WE HAVE RECEIVED AN ULTIMATUM DEMANDING THE SURRENDER OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN 48 HOURS OR A STATE OF WAR WILL EXIST.
- WHAT?
- AN ULTIMATUM FROM WHOM?
- THE INDIANS.
- BUT INDIA IS A NEUTRALIST NATION.
THOSE INDIANS?
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANY LITTLE INDIAN BAND IS GOING TO DEFEAT THE UNITED STATES ARMY.
I AGREE WITH YOU, GENERAL CUSTER.
DOESN'T PROVE A GREAT MILITARY THREAT, BUT ONE DISSIDENT GROUP COULD TRIGGER MORE WIDESPREAD INSURRECTIONS.
- CHIEF.
- HMM.
CUSTER IS A GOOD MAN, BUT I THINK FOR THIS EMERGENCY PERHAPS HE SHOULD BE RELIEVED OF HIS COMMAND.
MIGHT MAKE THE PUBLIC FEEL INSECURE, HIM STILL RUNNING THE SHOW.
JUST WHAT INDIANS ARE THESE?
APPARENTLY, GENERAL, IT'S A DISSIDENT GROUP CALLED THE RED FEATHERS ON A REMOTE RESERVATION IN ARIZONA.
GIVE ME TWO SQUADRONS OF BOMBERS, TWO 1,000-LB.
BOMBS, ROUND-THE-CLOCK SATURATION BOMBING OF ARIZONA.
FRED, YOU CAN'T BOMB ARIZONA.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
MY BOMBERS CAN HIT ANYPLACE ON THE FACE OF THIS GLOBE.
BUT ARIZONA IS PART OF THE UNITED STATES.
A LITTLE LOW-LEVEL STRAFING PERHAPS, HUH?
SORRY, FRED.
Custer: EXACTLY WHAT DO THESE INDIANS WHAT?
THE DEMAND THE RETURN OF ALL THE TERRITORY WE TOOK FROM THEM.
WELL, GIVE IT TO THEM.
BUT, HARRY, IT'S ALL THEIRS.
THE WHOLE COUNTRY.
- EVERYTHING?
- EVERYTHING.
WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT A MINUTE NOW.
MAYBE WE CAN MAKE A DEAL.
THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT LESS-- SAY, NEW JERSEY?
WOULD YOU?
WHAT PLANS DO YOU PEOPLE HAVE AGAINST INDIAN ATTACK?
- WELL -  - GO AHEAD, MAX.
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
GENTLEMEN, PLEASE BE SEATED.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW I'VE DONE A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THIS SUBJECT, AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE HERE A DETAILED MILITARY MANUAL THAT SUMS EVERYTHING UP VERY NICELY.
"INDIAN ATTACK".
"AN INDIAN ATTACK IS A GROUP OF INDIANS ATTACKING, AS IN THE SENTENCE, 'INDIANS ARE ATTACKING THE TOWN.
'" Chief: FINE MAX.
WHAT ABOUT STRATEGY?
STRATEGY, YES, SIR.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING, GENTLEMEN.
IF ATTACKED BY INDIANS IN OPEN COUNTRY MILITARY OR CIVILIAN PERSONNEL SHOULD FORM THEIR WAGONS IN A CIRCLE.
WHAT WE NEED IS A REALISTIC APPRAISAL OF THEIR STRENGTH.
WHAT WE NEED IS ONE GOOD INTELLIGENCE AGENT TO INFILTRATE, FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE UP TO.
YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'VE GOT THE MAN RIGHT HERE.
HE'S OBVIOUSLY RESEARCHED THE INDIANS THOROUGHLY AND KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.
HOW ABOUT IT, CHIEF?
ALL RIGHT, MAX, IT'S YOUR BABY.
I WANT YOU ON YOUR WAY TO ARIZONA AT ONCE.
RIGHT, CHIEF, ARIZONA.
I'LL BE ON THAT RESERVATION IN ARIZONA-- - ARIZONA?
- UM-HUH.
IS THE SATURATION BOMBING DEFINITELY OFF, CHIEF?
THIS IS CONTROL.
YES, SIR.
NO, SIR, IT'S JUST A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH SOME INDIANS.
NO, SIR.
WELL, WE HAVE THE OPTION OF EITHER ATTACKING IN FORCE OR GATHERING MORE INTELLIGENCE.
YOU CAN GO BACK TO SLEEP.
YOU CAN'T?
WELL, SIR, HAVE YOU TRIED A CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE?
IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, TRY A GLASS OF WARM MILK.
YES, SIR.
JUST A MINUTE.
HE WANTS YOUR APPRAISAL.
I THINK WE SHOULD ACQUIRE MORE INTELLIGENCE.
NO, HE MEANS HOT CHOCOLATE OR WARM MILK?
- 43?
- 86?
- 43.
- 99.
CAREFUL, THEY'RE FROM RENT-A-HORSE.
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN, 86?
YES, MY FIRST PLAN IS TO GET MY FOOT OUT OF THIS STIRRUP.
DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER PLAN?
SHH.
OKAY, I DON'T THINK ANYBODY CAN HEAR US NOW.
I'VE GOT TO GET ON THAT RESERVATION, GET INSIDE AND FIND OUT WHAT'S GOING ON.
HAVE YOU LEARNED ANYTHING NEW, 43?
THE RED FEATHERS ARE ARMING TO FIGHT.
THEY'VE SUMMONED THE LEADERS OF OTHER TRIBES.
THEY'RE CONCEALING A POWERFUL WEAPON IN THEIR MAIN TENT.
I'VE GOT TO GET INSIDE THAT TENT, TAKE SOME PICTURES WITH MY MICRO-CAMERA AND GET OUT.
THOSE FELLAS ARE ARMED.
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET THROUGH THEIR LINES IN BROAD DAYLIGHT?
AND I'M NOT SURE 43.
I'D BETTER CHECK MY EQUIPMENT.
BEADS $24 IN CASH.
YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD HAVE WISED UP BY NOW.
WELL, AT LEAST THEY GAVE ME MY ELECTRIC SNAKE.
AN ELECTRIC SNAKE?
YES, VERY VERY GOOD FOR CREATING A DIVERSION.
- WHAT DOES IT RUN ON?
- TINY LITTLE FEET.
- WHERE DOES IT GET ITS POWER?
- TRANSISTORS.
WHAT ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS?
OH, WE HAVE TINY LITTLE MINIATURE RADIO RECEIVERS THAT CAN BE HIDDEN ANYWHERE.
OH, AND THIS IS A SADDLE TRANSMITTER.
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT THERE, 99?
OH, THIS.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A BOOK ON INDIAN LORE.
HERE, YOU'D BETTER TAKE THIS, 99, AND SEE IF YOU CAN LEARN ANYTHING.
RIGHT.
NOW, LET'S SEE.
EXACTLY WHERE IS THAT INDIAN RESERVATION?
RIGHT OVER THERE, ABOUT TWO MILES.
INDIAN DRUMS.
CAN YOU TELL WHAT THEY'RE SAYING, MAX?
I'M NOT SURE, BUT WHOEVER IT IS, HE'S GOT A GREAT LEFT HAND.
OH, I WISH WE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON IN THERE.
LET THE DRUMS BE SILENT.
RED CLOUD, WHY HAVE YOU GATHERED US HERE?
I HAVE ISSUED AN ULTIMATUM.
IF IT IS NOT ANSWERED WITHIN 48 HOURS A STATE OF WAR WILL EXIST.
- Both: WAR?
- IS IT THE CHINESE?
- NO.
- THE RUSSIANS?
- NO.
- WHO THEN?
THE UNITED STATES.
THE UNITED STATES IS A NEUTRALIST NATION.
THEY HAVE TAKEN OUR LAND.
THEY MUST GIVE IT BACK.
RED CLOUD, THIS IS BAD MEDICINE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS THREE MILLION SOLDIERS, WE HAVE BUT 200 BRAVES.
WE MUST DEPEND HEAVILY ON THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
NOW, OUR ONE BIG ADVANTAGE IS THAT NOBODY KNOWS WE'RE HERE.
-  -  CANCEL ONE ADVANTAGE.
DON'T WORRY.
I KNOW HOW TO HANDLE INDIANS.
HOW!
GET OFF YOUR HORSE.
YOU, COME OVER HERE.
HURRY.
YOU ARE TRESPASSING ON INDIAN TERRITORY.
FOR THAT YOU MUST PAY.
RED CLOUD WILL DECIDE THE PENALTY.
ARE YOU ONE OF RED CLOUD'S MEN?
NO, I AM FROM ANOTHER TRIBE.
BUT I AM ON MY WAY TO THE RED FEATHERS' CAMP TO TAKE PART IN A CEREMONY.
TO THE WAR COUNCIL.
WE CAN'T LET HIM GO OR HE'LL GIVE US AWAY.
- COME.
WE GO TO RED CLOUD.
- STAND BACK, 99.
DON'T MAKE ANY MOVES YOU'LL BE SORRY FOR, MY FRIEND.
YOU SEE, I HAPPEN TO BE GREASED LIGHTNING WITH THESE.
AND I AM ALSO PRETTY FAST WITH THESE TOO.
COME, WE GO TO RED CLOUD.
MAX, WHAT ABOUT PLAN 26-E?
PLAN 26-E?
YES, WHAT IS PLAN 26-E?
UH, WHY DON'T YOU SHOW HIM, 99?
OH, ALL RIGHT, 86.
- IT'S THIS!
-  - QUICK THINKING, 86!
- GOOD WORK!
- YES, I'VE ALWAYS LOVED PLAN 26-E.
- SO HAVE I. NOT ME.
HERE'S MY PLAN, 43.
I'M GOING TO CHANGE CLOTHES WITH THIS INDIAN.
THAT WILL GIVE ME A COVER TO GET ONTO THE RESERVATION.
- AN EXCELLENT PLAN.
- THANK YOU.
NOW IF ONE OF YOU WILL HELP ME GET HIS CLOTHES OFF, THE OTHER CAN TURN THEIR BACK.
I THINK IT WILL WORK A LOT BETTER THE OTHER WAY AROUND.
COME IN, 99.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
PERFECTLY.
MAX, PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY UNNECESSARY CHANCES.
I WON'T.
I THINK THIS HEADGEAR WILL GET ME THROUGH THE INDIAN LINES.
ONCE INSIDE, ALL I WANT TO DO IS STAY IN THE BACKGROUND AND REMAIN INCONSPICUOUS.
OH, I HOPE AGENT 43 IS WATCHING THAT INDIAN CAREFULLY.
DON'T WORRY, 99.
YOU'RE WORTH TWO 43s, 86.
COME ON.
YOU MUST LET ME GO.
RELAX, YOU AREN'T GOING TO ANY WAR COUNCIL TONIGHT.
WAR COUNCIL?
I AM BETROTHED TO RED CLOUD'S DAUGHTER.
I GO TO MY WEDDING.
LOOK, RED CLOUD.
AH, THE TAPAWASSI!
AH, THE TAPAWASSI!
AH YES, THE TAPAWASSI.
WHERE?
YOU, TAPAWASSI.
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
I AM THE TAPAWASSI.
FINE TAPAWASSI.
QUICK, LOOK UP TAPAWASSI.
TAPAWASSI, UM - BETROTHED.
- LOOK UP BETROTHED.
MAX AH, MY FUTURE SON-IN-LAW.
I COME MANY MOONS OVER HIGH MOUNTAINS THROUGH-- SON-IN-LAW?
I OFFER YOU MY SINCERE FELICITATIONS.
THANK YOU, I'VE HAD A LONG DUSTY TRIP.
I THINK I'LL JUST GO OUT AND CLEAN UP.
DAD.
ONE MOMENT.
RUNNING CREEK, MY DAUGHTER WHITE CLOUD HAS BEEN AWAITING YOU.
I AM SURE THERE IS MUCH TO TALK ABOUT.
HELLO, RUNNING CREEK.
UH, I COME MANY MOONS OVER GREAT MOUNTAINS THROUGH DEEP RIVERS TO SEE WHITE CLOUD.
I JOIN MY FATHER IN EXTENDING A MOST GRACIOUS WELCOME TO YOU.
THANK YOU, WHITE CLOUD.
I WONDER, COULD YOU DIRECT ME TO THE MAIN TENT?
RUNNING CREEK, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN THESE MANY YEARS?
WELL, I'VE BEEN VISITING THE GREAT CITIES OF THE EAST.
TELL ME, WHITE CLOUD, WHAT ARE ALL THE PREPARATIONS GOING ON IN CAMP?
OH, MY FATHER'S BENT ON CONQUEST.
HE WANTS TO OVERTHROW THE UNITED STATES.
HE HAS A SECRET WEAPON IN HIS WAR TENT.
WELL, YOUR FATHER WOULD BE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE TO GO TO WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES.
- MANY PEOPLE COULD GET HURT.
- WHAT CAN I DO ABOUT IT?
YES, WELL, I DON'T KNOW, WHITE CLOUD, BUT MAYBE YOU COULD TAKE ME TO THE BIG TENT AND I COULD TALK THEM OUT OF USING THE SECRET WEAPON.
WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED ALL THESE YEARS AND ALL YOU CAN DO IS TALK TO ME ABOUT WAR AND SECRET WEAPONS?
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES SOMETIMES.
WHAT KIND OF TAPAWASSI ARE YOU?
WHAT KIND?
WELL, I'VE ASKED MYSELF THAT QUESTION MANY TIMES.
I SUPPOSE I'M JUST AN AVERAGE TAPAWASSI.
SHOW ME THE SIGNS OF INDIAN AFFECTION A TAPAWASSI SHOULD SHOW HIS BELOVED.
SIGNS OF-- WELL, PERHAPS LATER, WHITE CLOUD.
NO, NOW.
IF YOU WANT MY HELP THE LEAST YOU CAN DO IS BE NICE TO ME.
SPEAK TO ME IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TAPAWASSI OR I'LL SCREAM.
SHH.
DON'T SCREAM.
I'LL BE GLAD TO TALK TO YOU IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE TAPAWASSI.
THE TAPAWASSI USED DESCRIPTIVE LANGUAGE TO COMPARE HIS SQUAW WITH THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE.
UH, LOVELIER THAN THE GOLDEN SUNSET ARE YOU.
THE INDIAN LOVER SHOWS HIS REGARD FOR HIS SQUAW BY TAKING HER HAND STROKING HER HAIR AND KISSING HER ON THE ELBOW.
- ELBOW?
- ELBOW.
RUNNING CREEK!
YOUR YEARS SPENT IN THE GREAT CITIES OF THE EAST HAVE TURNED YOU INTO A REAL WEIRDO.
UH, WHITE CLOUD, I BROUGHT SOMETHING FOR YOU.
- WHAT IS IT?
- WELL, CLOSE YOUR MOUTH AND OPEN YOUR EYES AND THE TAPAWASSI WILL GIVE YOU A BIG SURPRISE.
AN OLD TRICK, WHITE CLOUD, BUT IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, THEY PULLED IT ON ME JUST LAST WEEK.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, WHITE CLOUD.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
WHAT IS THAT?
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER, I WOULD SAY IT WAS AN ELECTRIC SNAKE.
THE WAR TENT.
THE INDIANS HAVE RIGGED UP SOME SORT OF MISSILE SYSTEM HERE.
UH, I'M GOING TO TAKE SOME PICTURES.
I THINK IT'S THE WAR COUNCIL.
I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
THIS IS WAR TENT.
ELECTRONICS.
DON'T TOUCH.
GENTLEMEN, CHIEFS, BE SEATED.
I WELCOME ALL TRIBES TO COUNCIL OF WAR.
PROJECT RED FEATHERS IS READY TO STRIKE.
I HAVE BUT TO PRESS A BUTTON AND THAT PROJECTILE WILL GO STRAIGHT TO AMERICA'S HEART.
WAIT!
SHOULDN'T WE TALK THIS OVER?
NO, THE TIME FOR TALK HAS PASSED.
WILL IT BE WAR OR PEACE?
-  - CHIEFS CAST YOUR VOTE.
WAR OR PEACE.
WAR OR PEACE?
CAST.
CAST YOUR VOTE.
TWO FOR WAR AND TWO FOR PEACE.
I SHALL THROW THE DECIDING VOTE.
Max: OUCH.
HI, DAD.
NOW LISTEN, ABOUT THE HONEYMOON I THINK WHITE-- SILENCE!
AND YOU MY FUTURE SON-IN-LAW, HOW COULD YOU DO SUCH A THING?
SEIZE HIM!
WAIT, FATHER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS MAN IS AN IMPOSTER.
WE ARE GOING TO KILL HIM.
OH, I KNOW HE'S AN IMPOSTOR, BUT HE'S CUTE, AND I WANT HIM.
LOOK AT THAT.
OH, SO WHAT IF HE'S VAIN?
A LITTLE MAKEUP DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.
HE IS NOT EVEN YOUR TAPAWASSI.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M MAXWELL SMART, SECRET AGENT 86.
TORTURE HIM.
KILL HIM.
I AM ALSO A LIAR.
COULDN'T I HAVE HIM FOR A LITTLE WHILE?
YEAH, DAD, A HALF-HOUR ISN'T GOING TO HURT ANYBODY.
AFTER WE'RE THROUGH WITH HIM.
COULDN'T YOU WORK IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?
PLEASE, FATHER.
WELL MAYBE FOR THEN WE TORTURE HIM LATER.
NOW WE GO TO MY TEEPEE.
GOOD.
DOES YOUR FATHER HAVE A WATCH?
STICK 'EM UP!
NOW, SHE SHOWS UP.
CAN'T YOU COME BACK IN 15 MINUTES?
MAX, YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE YOUR HANDS UP.
ALL OF YOU.
GET AWAY FROM HIM.
YOU, GET FURTHEST AWAY.
MAX, LOOK!
I WILL NOT BE DENIED MY VENGEANCE ON THE UNITED STATES.
WAIT A MINUTE, RED CLOUD, I HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
I'M SURE IF YOU LISTEN WHAT I HAVE TO SAY, - YOU'LL CHANGE YOUR MIND ABOUT PRESSING THAT BUTTON.
- SPEAK QUICKLY.
NOW LISTEN, RED CLOUD, WE'VE ALWAYS HAD GREAT RESPECT FOR THE NOBLE RED MAN.
LET'S THINK OF THE PAST.
REMEMBER WHEN YOU ROAMED THESE GREAT PLAINS WITH YOUR BUFFALO.
AND THEN CAME OUR SETTLERS, AND THEN OUR SOLDERS-- UH, MAYBE WE'D BETTER FORGET ABOUT THE PAST.
THE PRESENT-- THAT'S WHAT COUNTS, THE PRESENT.
LET'S LOOK AT THE PRESENT.
LOOK WHAT WE'VE GIVEN YOU IN THE PRESENT.
THESE NICE, TINY LITTLE RESERVATIONS-- UH, LET'S TALK ABOUT THE FUTURE, RED CLOUD.
NOW, IF WE TAKE THE PROMISES OF THE PAST, AND JOIN THEM WITH THE POLICES OF THE PRESENT, THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO SAY.
LET 'ER RIP, RED CLOUD.
THAT'S THE SECOND BIGGEST ARROW I'VE EVER SEEN.
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW THAT RED CLOUD'S ENORMOUS ARROW IS NOW ON DISPLAY IN THE WEST WING OF THE WHITE HOUSE.
NO KIDDING, CHIEF.
WHERE DID IT LAND?
IN THE WEST WING OF THE WHITE HOUSE I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU.
THE NEWLY-APPOINTED UNDERSECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR FOR INDIAN AFFAIRS IS HERE TO PRESENT YOU WITH AN AWARD.
I TRAVEL OVER HIGH MOUNTAINS, ACROSS WIDE RIVERS TO BRING YOU MEDAL FROM MY PEOPLE.
RED CLOUD!
TAPAWASSI, MR.
RED CLOUD.
NOW, ABOUT MY DAUGHTER.
UH, GEE, DAD, I LOVE YOUR HAT.
BUT WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO THE ONE WITH THE HORNS?
{END OF EPISODE 06}{START OF EPISODE 07}
-  - CHIEF, IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S TRIED TO MAKE AN IMPRESSION OF THIS LOCK.
GENTLEMEN, AS OF THIS MOMENT ALL MEMBERS OF CONTROL ARE ON THE MAGENTA ALERT.
YOU DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN INFILTRATED, DO YOU, SIR?
I DON'T KNOW, HODGKINS, BUT WE'RE NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.
AT 4:00 THIS AFTERNOON OUR GOVERNMENT IS BRINGING TOGETHER SIX OF THE WORLD'S TOP SCIENTIFIC GENIUSES.
THE ULTIMATE DEFENSE OF OUR NATION MAY DEPEND UPON OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT THIS CONFERENCE AND THE SIX GREAT MINDS WHO ARE ATTENDING IT.
IF SOMEONE WAS IN FACT TAMPERING WITH THIS LOCK, WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT WHO IT WAS AND WHY IMMEDIATELY.
THERE'S ONLY ONE KEY THAT WILL OPEN THESE LOCKS, AND THAT'S IN THE POSSESSION OF THE CONTROL AGENT WHO'S IN CHARGE OF INTERNAL SECURITY THIS MONTH.
I WANT TO SEE HIM IN MY OFFICE RIGHT AWAY.
THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY MAY DEPEND UPON THAT KEY AND THAT MAN.
WHO IS IT, HODGKINS?
UH, AGENT 86, MAXWELL SMART.
-  -  UH, COMING.
UH, IN A MINUTE.
I SAID I'M COMING.
YES?
HELLO?
HELLO.
TWO, FIVE  SMART HERE.
YES, CHIEF.
A MAGENTA ALERT?
YES, SIR, THE EMERGENCY LIST, THE DUTY ROSTER AND THE KEY TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
FUNNY YOU SHOULD ASK, CHIEF.
I HAVE THEM ALL RIGHT AT MY FINGERTIPS.
UH, CHIEF, YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO NEED A DRAWER, WOULD YOU?
OH.
I DIDN'T THINK SO.
WHAT'S UP, CHIEF?
WHY THE MAGENTA ALERT?
ABOUT THE CONFERENCE THIS AFTERNOON.
WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT CONTROL MAY HAVE BEEN INFILTRATED.
- WHY?
- THE ALARM WENT OFF ON THE CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR.
NOW IT MAY HAVE BEEN A MALFUNCTION IN THE ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT, - BUT ON THE OTHER HAND-- - YES, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN, CHIEF.
I ASSUME YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR.
THAT'S RIGHT, CHIEF, AND NO ONE CAN TAKE IT AWAY FROM ME.
NOT AS LONG AS I HAVE IT ON THIS SECURITY CHAIN THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY PROFESSOR WINDISH.
GOOD.
NOW FROM HERE ON EVERYTHING IS CLASS "A" SECURITY.
HERE'S WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO-- WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY "CLASS 'A' SECURITY"?
I DID.
WELL, THEN SHOULDN'T WE-- DO YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE THE ROOM?
THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY, HODGKINS.
WE CAN TALK UNDER THE CONE OF SILENCE.
THE CONE OF SILENCE?
WELL, THIS IS A MAGENTA ALERT, ISN'T IT?
THE CONE OF SILENCE.
I AM DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
- WHAT?
- I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
- HOW'S THAT?
- HE'S CONCERNED ABOUT THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
OH.
I WANT IT THOROUGHLY INSPECTED FOR HIDDEN DEVICES-- MICROPHONES, BOMBS.
- WHAT?
- CHECK FOR MICROPHONES AND BOMBS.
OH.
WELL, DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT'S NECESSARY, CHIEF?
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT AN ANTI-INFILTRATION TACTIC?
- WHAT?
- HE WONDERS IF THAT'S AN ANTI-INFILTRATION TACTIC.
OH.
WHY AM I TALKING TO YOU?
WILL YOU GET THIS THING OFF ME?
-  - YOU KNOW THIS THING DOESN'T WORK.
WHY DO YOU ALWAYS INSIST ON USING IT?
WELL, FOR ONE THING, IT'S 20° COOLER INSIDE.
ALL RIGHT, HODGKINS.
CONE OF SILENCE!
LISTEN, MAX, THE MERE CHANCE THAT AN ENEMY AGENT MAY HAVE INFILTRATED CONTROL-- CHIEF, WHY DON'T YOU JUST CANCEL THE CONFERENCE?
IF I HAD TO ADMIT I WAS AFRAID TO HOLD A MEETING HERE IN OUR OWN BUILDING-- THE VERY AGENCY THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR NATION'S SECURITY-- I'D BE LAUGHED RIGHT OUT OF THE BUSINESS.
- CAN I MAKE A SUGGESTION, CHIEF?
- WHAT IS IT?
DON'T CANCEL THE CONFERENCE.
MAX, I WANT YOU TO GIVE THE CONFERENCE ROOM A COMPLETE EXAMINATION.
WELL, I'LL NEED SOME SPECIAL EQUIPMENT FOR THAT, CHIEF.
GET IT FROM THE LAB.
BUT, MAX, REMEMBER-- CLASS "A" SECURITY.
DON'T LET WINDISH KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
CHIEF, YOU DON'T MEAN THAT PROFESSOR WINDISH-- MAX, THAT MEETING THIS AFTERNOON IS VITAL TO OUR COUNTRY.
THOSE SIX MEN MUST BE PROTECTED.
ONE MAN WITH AN ORDINARY GUN-- SIX BULLETS-- COULD DESTROY THE HOPES OF THE FREE WORLD.
WELL, THEN NO ONE IS ABOVE SUSPICION.
FOR THE TIME BEING, YOU ARE THE ONLY MAN I CAN TRUST.
WELL, CHIEF, I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING ME INTO YOUR CONFIDENCE LIKE THIS.
MAX, THERE IS ALWAYS SOMEONE IN WHOM WE MUST HAVE FAITH.
WELL, I CERTAINLY AM GLAD YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT ME.
MAX, I THINK I KNOW YOU WELL ENOUGH TO SAY I TRUST YOU COMPLETELY.
THIS IS IT, ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE OF MY MANY INCREDIBLE INVENTIONS.
OH, PROFESSOR, IT'S BEAUTIFUL!
THANK YOU, MY DEAR.
INTO PERFECTING IT-- THE WORLD'S FIRST ELECTRO-RETROGRESSOR GUN.
JUST THINK OF IT, 99.
AT LAST, AT LAST, AN ACTUAL WORKING ELECTRO-RETROGRESSOR GUN.
- ONE THING, PROFESSOR.
- WHAT?
JUST WHAT IS AN ELECTRO-RETROGRESSOR GUN?
AIM IT, PRESS THE TRIGGER  THE VICTIM RECEIVES ONE SECOND OF THIS RAY; HE'LL BE TEMPORARILY INCAPABLE OF THINKING BEYOND THE LEVEL OF AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD.
- EVEN ADULTS?
- ANYONE.
THE MOST BRILLIANT MIND RETROGRESSES TO THE AGE OF EIGHT.
AMAZING!
YES, I AM.
LET'S PUT IT AWAY NOW.
THERE ARE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS THAT I WANT TO MAKE, BUT THEY CAN WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW.
ALMA, UNLOCK THE CABINET.
HENRY, TAKE THE GUN.
- BE CAREFUL NOW.
- YES, PROFESSOR.
CAREFUL, CAREFUL.
WHAT DO YOU THINK WE NEED FOR THE CONFERENCE ROOM?
WELL, I'D LIKE TO USE THE MAGIC EAR LISTENING DEVICE.
OH, YES.
AND WHAT ABOUT THE POCKET DISINTEGRATOR IN CASE WE HAVE TO TAKE APART SOMETHING THAT'S SOLID?
GOOD IDEA, 99, UH, BUT LET ME ASK.
I DON'T WANT - THE PROFESSOR TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE USING THEM FOR.
- OKAY.
OH, WINDISH?
- PROFESSOR?
PROFESSOR?
- YES, SMART?
PROFESSOR, I'D LIKE TO BORROW SOME OF YOUR EQUIPMENT.
I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND IF I USED YOUR POCKET DISINTEGRATOR PEN AND YOUR MAGIC EAR LISTENING DEVICE FOR A FEW HOURS.
- WHAT FOR?
- WELL, I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU, PROFESSOR, BUT IT'S ALL PRETTY TOP SECRET.
OH, THESE ARE NOT TOYS, 86.
I'M AFRAID THAT YOU'LL NEED A REQUISITION FOR THEM.
UM, PROFESSOR, I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SUCH FUN TO SEE HOW THOSE DEVICES WORK.
OH YEAH?
WELL OH.
Windish: THERE WE ARE.
JUST BRING THEM BACK WHEN YOU'RE THROUGH, MY DEAR.
OH, THANK YOU, PROFESSOR.
OH, ANYTHING FOR THE SERVICE.
COMING, 86?
NOTHING HERE, MAX.
NOTHING HERE EITHER, 99.
I THINK WE'D BETTER USE THE MAGIC EAR.
- HOW DOES THAT WORK?
- WELL, IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.
SEE, THIS PART FITS OVER THE EAR.
NOW TAKE THE CONTROL AND TURN THE INDICATOR TO ONE.
- RIGHT.
- NOW WATCH THIS.
I TAKE A HAIR FROM MY HEAD.
NOW LISTEN TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT HITS THE TABLE.
WOW, THAT'S REALLY INGENIOUS.
YES, AND THAT'S ONLY AT HALF VOLUME.
WELL, I THINK I'D BETTER GIVE THE WALLS A QUICK CHECK.
I DON'T SEEM TO BE GETTING ANYTHING.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER TURN THE VOLUME UP TO FULL.
RIGHT.
SORRY.
MA-- NOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING MECHANICAL OR ELECTRICAL IN THESE WALLS, THE MAGIC EAR WILL PICK UP THE NOISE.
UH-OH.
WHAT'S THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK AT THE CONTROL AND SEE WHAT THE INDICATOR SAYS.
IT'S POINTING TO "ELECTRICAL".
ELECTRICAL, EH?
WELL, IT COULD BE A BOMB WITH AN ELECTRICAL TIMING DEVICE.
WE'D BETTER USE THE DISINTEGRATOR.
DON'T YOU THINK WE'D BETTER CHECK IT OUT WITH THE CHIEF?
NO TIME FOR THAT.
THAT BOMB'S LIABLE TO GO OFF AT ANY MOMENT.
I'VE GOTTA TAKE THIS DISINTEGRATOR AND CUT THROUGH THAT WALL - AND SEE WHAT'S MAKING THAT NOISE.
- WHAT'S BEHIND THAT WALL?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT MIGHT BE THE SUPPLY ROOM, THE CHIEF'S OFFICE OR THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING.
BE CAREFUL, MAX.
IT'S THE CHIEF'S OFFICE.
HI, CHIEF.
UH, SORRY ABOUT THIS.
I SEE YOU'RE SHAVING.
MISSED A LITTLE SPOT RIGHT THERE.
WELL, CHIEF, NO PROBLEM SO FAR.
WE'VE GOT THE CONFERENCE ROOM COMPLETELY SAFE AND SEALED OFF.
EXCELLENT.
I THINK WE'VE TAKEN EVERY PRECAUTION.
BUT THE MAGENTA ALERT IS STILL ON.
YES, WELL, WE ALL APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN, CHIEF, BUT I THINK YOU CAN RELAX FOR A WHILE.
AS AGENT IN CHARGE OF INTERNAL SECURITY, I CAN GIVE YOU MY PERSONAL ASSURANCE THAT EVERYTHING IS UNDER PERFECT CONTROL.
UH, WOULD YOU SETTLE FOR ALMOST PERFECT?
HODGKINS, WHO THREW THE ALARM?
It came from the laboratory, sir.
- Are you there, Chief?
- WHAT IS IT, WINDISH?
Someone has stolen my retrogressor gun.
PROFESSOR, DIDN'T YOU HAVE IT LOCKED UP?
Yes, I did.
But I wanted to do some work on one of the mechanisms.
I just started to work on it when-- HOLD ON, PROFESSOR.
HODGKINS, SEAL OFF THE ENTIRE BUILDING.
PROFESSOR, DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO STOLE THE GUN?
Yes.
I can't believe it, but it was one of our own people.
WHO, PROFESSOR, WHO?
- It was-- -  I want my mommy.
Mommy, where are you, Mommy?
I want my mommy.
I want my mommy.
HOW LONG WILL THE EFFECTS OF THE RETROGRESSOR GUN LAST?
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING, AND NOW THE PROFESSOR CAN'T TELL US.
HIS MIND IS THE MIND OF AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHILD.
AN ENEMY AGENT IN OUR MIDST AND HE HAS THE RETROGRESSOR GUN.
WE'VE GOT TO FIND THAT GUN, CHIEF.
START WITH EVERY AGENT ON DUTY OUTSIDE THE BUILDING.
FIND OUT IF ANYONE HAS LEFT THE BUILDING IN THE LAST FEW MINUTES.
WE'VE GOT ONLY TWO HOURS UNTIL THAT CONFERENCE STARTS.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
HOW MANY AGENTS HAVE WE CHECKED OUT SO FAR?
ALL CLEAR EXCEPT AGENT 17.
HOLD IT.
RECOGNIZE HIM?
YES, THAT'S AGENT 17.
WOW, WHAT A DISGUISE.
SHOULD WE QUESTION HIM?
NO, NOT NOW.
THE ORGAN GRINDER IS WATCHING HIM TOO CLOSELY.
MAX, IF NONE OF OUR AGENTS ON THE OUTSIDE SAW ANYONE LEAVING THE BUILDING, THAT MEANS WHOEVER STOLE THE RETROGRESSOR GUN IS STILL IN HERE.
YES, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING, 99.
AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THIEF IS PROBABLY - PLANNING TO USE IT ON THE DELEGATES.
- OR US.
MAX, YOU'RE IN DANGER.
SO ARE YOU, 99.
OH, MAX.
-  - OH, WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S THE CHIEF'S OFFICE.
COME ON.
CHIEF, HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU?
- CHIEF.
- I WANNA GO OUT AND PLAY.
OH, NO.
THEY GOT HIM TOO.
WELL, AT LEAST THE PROFESSOR WILL HAVE SOMEONE TO PLAY WITH.
OH, MAX, THERE'S NO ONE IN CHARGE.
WHO'S GOING TO TAKE OVER?
- I AM.
- OH.
- 99.
- YES.
TAKE THE CHIEF DOWN TO THE INFIRMARY.
- I WANNA GO OUT AND PLAY.
- COME ON, CHIEF, COME ON.
HODGKINS, GET IN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
- 99.
- YES.
I WANT A COMPLETE CHECK ON EVERY AGENT WHO'S BEEN ON DUTY IN THIS BUILDING - FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS.
- RIGHT.
NOW HEAR  THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.
NO ONE WILL LEAVE THIS BUILDING.
I REPEAT, NO ONE WILL LEAVE THIS BUILDING.
- HODGKINS!
- AHEM.
OH.
HODGKINS, I WANT THE OFFICER RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERNAL SECURITY IN HERE ON THE DOUBLE.
YOU'RE THE INTERNAL SECURITY OFFICER.
FAST WORK, HODGKINS.
NOW I WANT A COMPLETE CHANGE OF PERSONNEL ON THE ENTRANCES AND EXITS.
RELAY ALL CALLS THROUGH THIS OFFICE.
NOT SO FAST, PLEASE.
UH, CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR A SECOND?
UH, I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE.
ARE YOU STILL THERE?
UH, LISTEN, I'LL HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK LATER YEAH.
UH, CORRECTION.
NO CALLS WILL BE RELAYED THROUGH THIS OFFICE.
CODE ROOM.
CODE ROOM, I WANT NEW PASSWORDS AND COUNTERSIGNS.
RADIO COMMUNICATIONS WILL BE TRANSFERRED TO EMERGENCY FREQUENCY.
I WANT ALL AGENTS ON THE OUTSIDE BROUGHT INSIDE.
I WANT ALL AGENTS ON THE INSIDE BROUGHT OUTSIDE.
MAX!
MAX!
MAX, THE DELEGATES HAVE JUST ARRIVED.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
THEY'VE ALREADY PASSED EXTERNAL SECURITY.
- SAY WHAT?
- THE DELEGATES, THEY'VE ALREADY ARRIVED.
THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM.
THE MEETING BEGINS IN FIVE MINUTES, MAX!
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOUT, 99.
I CAN HEAR YOU.
THEY MUSTN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE CHIEF.
I'VE GOTTA GO DOWN TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM AND LET THEM IN.
HODGKINS, TAKE OVER.
- COME ON, 99.
- RIGHT.
GENTLEMEN, AS OFFICER IN CHARGE OF INTERNAL SECURITY HERE, IT IS MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME YOU AND TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOUR CONFERENCE WILL BE SAFE AND PLEASANT.
THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE HIMSELF TO WELCOME YOU, BUT I'M SURE THAT HE'LL JOIN US, UH, AS SOON AS HE'S HAD HIS NAP.
HIS NAP?
UH, N.A.P. NATIONAL AREA PROGRAM REPORTS.
WELL, IN THE MEANTIME IT WILL BE MY PLEASURE TO UNLOCK THE CONFERENCE ROOM DOOR AND LET YOU GENTLEMEN GET ON WITH YOUR WORK.
I SHALL BE IN CHARGE OF SECURITY DURING THE ENTIRE CONFERENCE.
UH, AS YOU'LL NOTICE, THIS IS A GOOD FIRM, SOLID DOOR.
IT'S PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET INTO THIS CONFERENCE ROOM.
HOWEVER, I HAVE A PLAN.
I HAVE AN ALTERNATE PLAN.
RIGHT THIS WAY, GENTLEMEN.
AND I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D HURRY.
IT'S A LITTLE DRAFTY OUT HERE.
ARE YOU HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE, 86?
UH, NO, 99.
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET THE KEY OUT OF THE LOCK.
I WONDER WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU PUSHED THE KEY IN AND THEN TURNED IT.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, 99, I'D LIKE TO HANDLE THIS MYSELF.
YOU SEE, I'M JUST GONNA PUSH THE KEY IN AND TURN IT.
ALL OVER FOR YOU.
- WHAT IS IT, RADCHECK.
- TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
- WHAT IS IT?
- CLAY, THE KIND THAT'S USED FOR MAKING IMPRESSIONS OF LOCKS.
- WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?
- IN ALMA SUTTON'S PURSE.
ALMA SUTTON?
YOUR COWORKER?
I'VE SUSPECTED HER FOR A LONG TIME.
SHE'S IN THE LAB RIGHT NOW.
RADCHECK, YOU STAY HERE AND GUARD THE CONFERENCE.
- 99, WE'LL GO GET ALMA.
- RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT, ALMA-- DID YOU COME DOWN TO PLAY WITH ME?
OOH, I LOVE TO JUMP ROPE.
NEXT TO WATCHING "CAPTAIN KANGAROO" ON TELEVISION I LOVE JUMPING ROPE THE BEST.
SHE'S BEEN HIT BY THE RETROGRESSOR GUN TOO.
IT'S NOT HER.
AND IF IT'S NOT HER, THEN IT'S GOT TO BE RADCHECK.
AND I LEFT HIM GUARDING THE MEETING.
- COME ON.
- OH!
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
RADCHECK, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
YOU'RE A SPY, A TRAITOR AND A DOUBLE-DEALER.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL CONFESS.
I'M COMPLETELY INNOCENT!
THAT'S A GOOD START.
OKAY, 99, I THINK WE CAN START WITH THE INTERROGATION NOW.
CHECK, 86.
OKAY, RADCHECK, START TALKING.
- 99: WHO PAYS YOU?
- WHO DO YOU REPORT TO?
- WHOM.
- WHOM?
LOOK, I'LL TELL YOU EVERYTHING.
JUST A MINUTE, RADCHECK.
ARE YOU SURE IT'S WHOM, 99?
OH YEAH, I THINK SO, BECAUSE WHOM IS THE OBJECTIVE, YOU SEE, - AND IF YOU HAVE A PREPOSITION-- - I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT.
WHO DO YOU REPORT TO?
WHOM DO YOU REPORT TO?
IT'S WHOM.
IT IS?
OH.
WELL, THEN IN THAT CASE PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL US WHOM HAD ACCESS TO THE RETROGRESSOR?
I TELL YOU IT WAS ALMA SUTTON.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, RADCHECK.
YOU'VE TURNED ALMA SUTTON INTO AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHILD WHO WANTS NOTHING MORE THAN TO WATCH "CAPTAIN KANGAROO".
- "CAPTAIN KANGAROO".
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
OR COURSE, THAT'S IT!
WHY DIDN'T I SEE IT BEFORE?
UNLOCK HIM, 99.
WELL, ALMA, ARE YOU STILL AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD OR HAVE YOU DECIDED TO ACT YOUR AGE?
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?
WELL, YOU HAD ME FOOLED FOR A WHILE, BUT YOU MADE ONE LITTLE MISTAKE.
WHEN YOU SAID THAT YOU WATCH "CAPTAIN KANGAROO," I REALIZED THAT IF YOU'D ACTUALLY BEEN SHOT BY THE RETROGRESSOR GUN YOU COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE SEEN THAT SHOW, BECAUSE "CAPTAIN KANGAROO" WAS NOT ON WHEN YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS OLD.
VERY CLEVER, MR.
SMART, BUT YOU ALSO MADE ONE LITTLE MISTAKE.
- OH?
WHAT WAS THAT?
- COMING HERE.
THE DOOR TO THE CONFERENCE ROOM IS LOCKED.
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET IN, BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH THE KEY ALMA, YOU WANT TO GET INTO THAT CONFERENCE ROOM?
JUST GIVE ME ONE GOOD REASON WHY I SHOULD LET YOU IN.
HERE'S ONE.
YOU WANT TO TRY FOR TWO OUT OF THREE?
OPEN THE DOOR, SMART.
ALL RIGHT, ALMA.
JUST THINK OF IT, 86, IN JUST A FEW MINUTES SIX OF THE GREATEST SCIENTISTS IN THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BE RUNNING AROUND THE ROOM PLAYING HOPSCOTCH.
- ALMA-- - QUIET.
TURN AROUND.
PUT YOUR HANDS UP.
YOU'RE NEXT.
BANG BANG.
OKAY, ALMA, YOU'D BETTER COME ALONG WITH YOUR UNCLE MAX.
LITTLE GIRLS LIKE YOU BELONG IN JAIL.
I'LL GO IF YOU'LL SKIP WITH ME.
IT WAS AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE, MAX.
SIMPLY AMAZING.
YES, WELL, THANK YOU, CHIEF.
I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT NOW.
- DID I GIVE YOU ANY TROUBLE?
- NO, AS A MATTER OF FACT, YOU WERE A DELIGHTFUL CHILD.
THANK YOU.
WHAT ABOUT PROFESSOR WINDISH?
OH, HE CAME OUT OF IT ABOUT AN HOUR AGO.
YES, AND I UNDERSTAND HE'S GOING TO DESTROY THE RETROGRESSOR GUN.
WHY?
WELL, APPARENTLY HE HAD A ROTTEN CHILDHOOD.
WELL, YOU BOTH DID A REMARKABLE JOB.
I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.
WHAT'S THAT, CHIEF?
BECAUSE OF THE EXCELLENCE OF YOUR WORK IN PROTECTING THOSE MEN IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM, WE'VE DECIDED TO GIVE YOU THIS CERTIFICATE OF MERITORIOUS SERVICE.
OH, GOSH, CHIEF, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING, MAX.
JUST READ IT OVER AND THEN DESTROY IT.
DESTROY IT?
THIS IS A SECRET ORGANIZATION.
OH.
{END OF EPISODE 07}{START OF EPISODE 08}
-  - TAKE IT EASY, TAKE IT EASY!
I'M COMING, I'M COMING!
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG APARTMENT.
THERE'S NO PARTY HERE.
Man: SOMEBODY'S AFTER ME.
I NEED YOUR HELP.
LET ME IN, PLEASE!
LISTEN, WRANGLER, I DON'T WANNA BE A PARTY POOPER, BUT YOU'VE GOT A KNIFE IN YOUR BACK.
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
MUST TALK!
MUST TALK!
- TAKE IT EASY NOW, TAKE IT EASY!
- MUST TALK!
ALL RIGHT, JUST LET ME GET YOU UP HERE TO THIS COUCH.
- NOW, THERE YOU GO.
- NO, THEY MIGHT COME BACK.
- PLEASE, ANOTHER ROOM.
- ANOTHER ROOM.
UH I'LL TAKE YOU UPSTAIRS TO THE BEDROOM.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, I'VE GOT A PLAN HERE.
I'LL JUST TAKE YOU UP WITH THE OLD FIREMAN'S CARRY.
I'VE GOT AN ALTERNATE PLAN.
TAKE A HOLD OF ME THERE.
THERE YOU GO!
NOW IT'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
I ONCE KNEW A GUY WHO HAD A KNIFE IN HIS HEART AND LIVED FOR 15 YEARS.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
THAT'S HARD TO BELIEVE!
WOULD YOU BELIEVE I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT A PIN IN HIS NOSE?
YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO CHEER ME UP.
LET'S TAKE IT EASY, FELLA!
YOU'RE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.
THERE WE GO.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
MATTER OF LIFE OR DEATH MUST TALK!
FIRST YOU'LL SLEEP, THEN YOU'LL TALK.
NOW JUST LIE BACK, YOU'LL FEEL-- -  - OOH!
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.
YEAH-- UH.
SORRY, PARTNER.
NOW I'LL NEVER KNOW WHAT HE WANTED TO TELL ME.
INFORMATION.
MUST TALK!
YES!
I'M LISTENING.
GO AHEAD.
THEY'RE GOING TO POISON HIM.
POISON?
POISON WHO?
WELL, YOU TRIED.
AT LEAST I KNOW THEY'RE GONNA POISON SOMEONE.
- I'D BETTER NOTIFY THE CHIEF.
- THE AMBASSADOR!
THE AMBASSADOR?
- THEY'RE GOING TO POISON THE AMBASSADOR?
- YES, THE AMBASSADOR.
ARE YOU FINISHED?
AT LEAST I KNOW THEY'RE GOING POISON THE AMBASSADOR.
BUT WHICH AMBASSADOR?
WHICH AMBASSADOR?
WHICH AMBASSADOR?
HELLO, CHIEF?
THIS IS MAX.
LISTEN, CHIEF, I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT I'VE GOT A DEAD COWBOY IN MY BED, AND THEY'RE GOING TO POISON THE AMBASSADOR.
NO, CHIEF, A DEAD COWBOY.
NO, CHIEF, I'M NOT CRAZY WITH FATIGUE.
I'M TELLING YOU, THERE'S A DEAD COWBOY IN MY BED.
YES, WELL I THINK YOU'D BETTER GET OVER HERE ON THE DOUBLE.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
THE CHIEF IS ON HIS WAY.
HE'LL BE HERE RIGHT-- COWBOY?
WHERE ARE YOU, COWBOY?
COME ON, OLD WRANGLER!
NO HIDING NOW!
MAX, YOU'VE GOT TO FACE THE FACTS.
YOU'VE JUST BEEN HAVING A NIGHTMARE!
A BAD DREAM!
CHIEF, I'M WIDE AWAKE!
MAX, LISTEN TO ME.
FOR THE PAST FOUR MONTHS YOU'VE BEEN ON ONE OF THE TOUGHEST CASES OF YOUR CAREER.
YOU'VE TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES GATHERING EVIDENCE THAT WILL PUT THE LEADERS OF KAOS BEHIND BARS.
WELL, I GOT THE EVIDENCE, DIDN'T I, CHIEF?
WORKING, DRIVING, PUSHING, STRIVING, STRAINING, WORKING, MOVING, MOVING, MOVING, MOVING!
I'M SORRY, CHIEF, FORGIVE ME.
I'M NOT MYSELF.
I'M SO TIRED.
MAX, THE ONLY THING THAT WILL MAKE OUR CASE AGAINST KAOS STICK IS YOUR TESTIMONY AT THAT HEARING TOMORROW MORNING.
NOW YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU IN COURT OR ALL YOUR FIELDWORK WILL-- WILL JUST BE GONE RIGHT DOWN THE DRAIN.
BUT, CHIEF, THE AMBASSADOR!
THERE IS NO AMBASSADOR AND THERE IS NO COWBOY.
THERE'S ONLY YOUR OWN EXHAUSTED MIND PLAYING GAMES WITH YOU.
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?
- YES, I DO.
MAYBE I SHOULD GET SOME SLEEP.
YES, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO GET SOME SLEEP BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO HAVE YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU TOMORROW AT THAT COURTROOM.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT, CHIEF.
I MUST HAVE IMAGINED THE WHOLE THING.
YES, NOW GO ON UPSTAIRS AND GET SLEEP AND YOU'LL BE IN SHAPE FOR TOMORROW.
THANK YOU, CHIEF, I APPRECIATE YOUR COMING OVER.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
GOTTA GET A GRIP ON MYSELF.
WHOLE THING MUST'VE BEEN JUST A BAD DREAM.
OH.
PARDON ME, FELLA.
"PARDON ME, FELLA"?
YOU'RE BACK!
I'VE GOTTA TELL THE CHIEF.
WAIT RIGHT HERE!
CHIEF!
CHIEF!
TOO LATE, HE'S GONE.
THAT MEANS I WON'T BE ABLE TO REACH HIM UNTIL HE GETS BACK TO HIS HOUSE.
THE CHIEF IS-- I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
FIRST HE WAS HERE, AND THEN HE WAS GONE AND NOW HE'S BACK!
WHERE COULD HE HAVE GONE TO?
Cowboy: HID ON THE LEDGE OUTSIDE THE WINDOW.
OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, OF COURSE.
NO WONDER I COULDN'T FIND YOU.
- BUT WHY?
- I HEARD NOISES, VOICES.
I WAS AFRAID THEY WERE COMING BACK TO FINISH ME OFF.
I'VE GOT A FEELING NOBODY CAN FINISH YOU OFF.
THEY'RE COMING BACK FOR ME.
THEY?
WHO ARE THEY?
- KAOS.
- KAOS!
YOU MEAN KAOS IS GOING TO POISON THE AMBASSADOR?
YES, TONIGHT AT A MASQUERADE PARTY AT THE EMBASSY.
I WAS ON MY WAY THERE WHEN THEY GOT ME.
HOW ARE THEY GOING TO POISON HIM?
A TOAST AT MIDNIGHT-- POISON PUNCH.
POISON PUNCH AT THE EMBASSY.
WHAT EMBASSY?
- WHAT EMBASSY?
- MOROVIAN EMBASSY!
MOROVIAN EMBASSY.
QUICK, GET ME A DOCTOR.
DON'T WORRY, JUST STAY HERE AND REST AND TAKE IT EASY THERE'S A DOCTOR DOWNSTAIRS, I'LL GET HER.
TAKE IT EASY AND REST, AND DON'T GET EXCITED.
JUST LIE RIGHT THERE.
I'LL GET THE DOCTOR.
NOW-- NOW, JUST LIE STILL AND DON'T MOVE.
AND AVOID STARCHY FOODS.
OH!
I'M SORRY, BUT I DON'T HAVE ANY TIME.
BESIDES, I HAVE ALL THE BRUSHES I NEED.
OH-- NO NO NO.
I'M DR.
ANDREW FISH.
- MAY I SEE MRS.
DAWSON?
- I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, BUT MRS.
DAWSON LIVES IN THE APARTMENT DOWN AT THE END OF THE HALL.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
TERRIBLY SORRY I DISTURBED YOU.
YOU DIDN'T DISTURB ME.
I WAS JUST ON MY WAY OUT TO FIND A DOCTOR.
- OH.
- "DOCTOR"?
DOCTOR, I THINK YOU'D BETTER STEP INSIDE.
BUT MRS.
DAWSON HAS BROKEN HER ANKLE.
I UNDERSTAND SHE'S IN GREAT PAIN.
YOU SEE, THE POOR WOMAN TRIPPED OVER HER CAT.
I REALLY THINK I SHOULD GO.
UH, DOCTOR, A MAN HAS BEEN STABBED.
- WHERE?
- IN MY BEDROOM.
LEAD THE WAY, SIR.
I'M SORRY.
I'M AFRAID I'M TOO LATE.
HE'S DEAD.
THAT'LL BE $12, PLEASE.
- $12?
- WELL, THAT'S STANDARD FOR A HOUSE CALL.
HMM.
I SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT HIM DOWN TO YOUR OFFICE.
IF YOU'LL JUST GIVE ME THE NECESSARY DETAILS I'LL PREPARE THE DEATH CERTIFICATE AND NOTIFY THE POLICE.
- I'M AFRAID YOU CAN'T DO THAT, DOCTOR.
- I'M REQUIRED TO BY LAW!
- DOCTOR, DO YOU KNOW WHO I AM?
- NO.
MY CARD.
"AHN KIPNESS, FURRIER TO THE STARS".
- YOU'RE A FURRIER?
- NO, DOCTOR.
IF YOU'LL JUST HOLD THIS CARD UP TO THE LIGHT, YOU'LL SEE MY TRUE IDENTITY.
MAXWELL SMART, SECRET AGENT 86.
OH.
HMM.
IS THIS A-- THIS IS A SECURITY MATTER.
THAT'S RIGHT, DOCTOR.
I WANT YOU TO FORGET EVERYTHING YOU'VE SEEN OR HEARD HERE TONIGHT.
WIPE IT COMPLETELY FROM YOUR MEMORY.
NOW REMEMBER, DOCTOR, I WANT YOU TO WIPE EVERYTHING FROM YOUR MEMORY.
WIPE EVERYTHING FROM MY MEMORY.
ER-- EVEN MY $12?
ESPECIALLY YOUR $12.
THANK YOU, DOCTOR.
GOOD NIGHT.
UH GOOD NIGHT.
I'VE GOTTA CONTACT THE CHIEF IMMEDIATELY.
HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX.
LISTEN, CHIEF, YOU KNOW THAT DEAD COWBOY I TOLD YOU ABOUT?
YEAH.
WELL, HE'S DEAD AGAIN.
THAT'S NOT NICE, CHIEF.
WELL I HAVE PROOF THIS TIME.
I BROUGHT IN A DOCTOR, AND THE DOCTOR EXAMINED HIM, AND PRONOUNCED HIM DEAD.
WHAT DOCTOR?
ER, DR.
FISH.
IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, I'LL GET THE DOCTOR AND HE CAN TELL YOU HIMSELF.
HOLD ON.
MRS.
DAWSON, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY TO DISTURB YOU.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS?
YES, BUT I KNEW YOU'D STILL BE UP WITH YOUR ANKLE.
I'M RARELY UP WITHOUT IT.
I HOPE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK ALL THE WAY TO THE DOOR.
NO, I TOOK A BUS FROM THE LIVING ROOM.
MRS.
DAWSON, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT I SPEAK WITH DR.
FISH.
- DR.
WHO?
- FISH.
FISH!
DR.
FISH IS OUT WITH LAWYER BIRD AND FARMER FOX.
BUT, MRS.
DAWSON, WHAT ABOUT YOUR ANKLE?
- WHAT ABOUT IT?
- OH.
WELL, IT'S QUITE LOVELY.
I'D LOVE TO STAY AND TALK ABOUT IT, BUT I HAVE SOMEBODY ON THE PHONE.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY AND GET SOME SLEEP, MRS.
DAWSON?
HELLO, CHIEF?
DR.
FISH WAS GONE, BUT THE BODY IS STILL-- YOU'D BETTER STAND BY, CHIEF.
AND SWITCH TO PHONE X-B-B.
HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX.
LISTEN, JUST FORGET THE WHOLE THING.
JUST PRETEND YOU'RE DREAMING I'M TALKING TO YOU.
BECAUSE I'M DREAMING THAT YOU'RE DREAMING THAT I'M TALKING TO YOU.
IT CAN'T BE A DREAM.
NOT TWICE IN A ROW!
CAN I BE THAT I'M LOSING MY MIND?
WELL THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
HELLO, OPERATOR?
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.
GET ME THE MOROVIAN EMBASSY.
Max: Hello?
Morovian Embassy?
YES?
THIS IS THE MOROVIAN EMBASSY.
LISTEN, THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT.
I'VE GOT TO FIND OUT IF THERE'S A MASQUERADE PARTY FOR THE AMBASSADOR TONIGHT.
YES, IT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW.
I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE AMBASSADOR.
I'M SORRY, SIR.
WHY DON'T YOU TRY TOMORROW?
BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS IS VITAL!
IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH!
I'll come right over.
IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD, SIR.
THIS IS A PRIVATE PARTY.
EVEN IF YOU WERE INVITED, YOU COULDN'T GET IN WITHOUT A COSTUME.
I'M SORRY.
I'VE GOT TO GET INTO THAT EMBASSY.
"THE ALL-NIGHT COSTUME COMPANY".
THE COWBOY MUST HAVE DROPPED THIS!
HE TOOK THE BAIT.
OF COURSE HE DID.
NO CONTROL AGENT CAN STAND UP TO THE LOGIC AND PLANNING OF KAOS.
AND WHEN SMART GETS ON THAT STAND TOMORROW, THE WHOLE CASE AGAINST KAOS WILL BE THROWN OUT OF COURT.
ISN'T THAT SO, DR.
FISH?
RIGHT.
EVEN HIS CHIEF THINKS HE'S CRACKING UP.
AND NOW HE'S FALLING INTO OUR TRAP AT THE EMBASSY.
I'VE GOTTA CHANGE AND GET OVER THERE.
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
AFTER TONIGHT, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BELIEVE MAXWELL SMART IS A BABBLING LUNATIC!
I DON'T HAVE ANY LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIES.
I'M TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU THAT A FELLA CAME IN HERE THIS MORNING, KIND OF WEIRD-LOOKING GUY, WITH DARK GLASSES, AND A SCAR ON HIS FACE, AND HE CLEANED ME OUT COMPLETELY.
I'VE GOT TO HAVE A COSTUME, IT'S A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING, ANYTHING AT ALL?
HE DID LEAVE THIS ONE COSTUME, AND I DON'T THINK YOU WANT IT.
IT'S A RETURN FROM THE 4-H CLUB PICNIC.
I'LL TAKE IT.
WHERE'S THE DRESSING ROOM?
IN THERE.
BUT NOW LISTEN, YOU-- LET US RAISE OUR GLASSES HIGH.
TO OUR HONORED HOST, THE AMBASSADOR OF MOROVIA.
THANK YOU, MY FRIENDS.
THIS IS A PROUD AND WONDERFUL MOMENT FOR ME TO BE WITH-- DON'T DRINK THAT PUNCH!
IT'S POISON!
I KNOW THAT MAN.
THAT'S MAXWELL SMART!
MR.
AMBASSADOR, AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT ABOUT THE MASQUERADE PARTY-- - WHAT MASQUERADE PARTY?
- THIS MASQUERADE PARTY!
THAT'S WHY I HAD THE FORESIGHT TO TAKE THIS CHICKEN-- THESE ARE THE WORST COSTUMES I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE!
YOU AND I ARE A CINCH FOR FIRST AND SECOND PRIZES.
GRAB HIM.
HE'S GONE BERSERK!
MR.
AMBASSADOR, THIS IS A PLOT AGAINST YOUR LIFE.
ONE SIP FROM THAT PUNCH MEANS INSTANT DEATH.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
WOULD YOU BELIEVE TWO SIPS?
VERY TASTY.
THE MAN IS OBVIOUSLY A LUNATIC.
NOW KINDLY REMOVE THIS MAD CHICKEN!
I'M NOT A CHICKEN!
I'M A SECRET AGENT.
MR.
AMBASSADOR, THEY'RE TRYING TO KILL YOU.
THE DEAD COWBOY TOLD ME.
THEY KILLED HIM TWICE!
GENTLEMEN, THIS PRETRIAL HEARING IS AN EXAMINATION OF EVIDENCE TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT A TRUE INDICTMENT SHALL BE DRAWN UP AGAINST CERTAIN ALLEGED LEADERS OF KAOS, AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF EVIL.
YOUR HONOR, I THINK WE CAN END THIS HEARING VERY QUICKLY.
THE GOVERNMENT'S ENTIRE WOULD-BE CASE IS BASED ON THE TESTIMONY OF ONE MAN-- MAXWELL SMART.
NOW WE INTEND TO SHOW MR.
SMART'S TESTIMONY IS INADMISSIBLE BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THAT HE IS INCOMPETENT, DERANGED, AND NOT IN FULL POSSESSION OF HIS FACULTIES.
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
THEY HAVEN'T GOT A CASE.
THE ODDS AGAINST THEM ARE 1,000 TO ONE.
MY FIRST WITNESS WILL BE THE MOROVIAN AMBASSADOR.
MAKE THAT EIGHT TO FIVE.
HR BURST INTO THE ROOM DRESSED AS A CHICKEN, ATTACKED ME, KNOCKED THE DRINK FROM MY HAND, AND MUMBLED SOMETHING ABOUT POISON.
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, HE BANGS ON MY DOOR WITH A WILD LOOK IN THEM BEADY EYES OF HIS SCREAMING FOR A "DR.
FISH," AND TELLS ME I'VE GOT A BROKEN ANKLE.
WHEN I DRANK THE PUNCH, HE GOT FURIOUS.
IT'S APPARENT THAT HIS ACTIONS CAN ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS THE RAVINGS OF A MADMAN.
NO, THERE WAS NO DEAD COWBOY, AND THERE WAS NO DR.
FISH.
- BUT YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER-- - THAT'S ALL, CHIEF.
- BUT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT-- - PLEASE, STEP DOWN.
A MAN WHO SEES IMAGINARY COWBOYS, SOME LIVING, SOME DEAD, WHOSE OWN TWISTED MIND MANUFACTURES PLOTS TO POISON AMBASSADORS AND WHO LIKES TO DRESS UP LIKE A CHICKEN, THAT'S THE GOVERNMENT'S STAR WITNESS AND THE REASON WHY THIS PRETRIAL HEARING IS NOTHING MORE THAN AN EMPTY FARCE.
YOUR HONOR, I BEG THE COURT'S INDULGENCE.
I DEMAND THE RIGHT TO CROSS-EXAMINE SOME OF THESE WITNESSES WHOSE TESTIMONY HAS MADE MY FUTURE SEEM SHALL WE SAY DIM?
LET'S SAY JET BLACK.
YOUR HONOR, MAY I CONTINUE?
WELL IT'S MOST UNUSUAL PROCEDURE, MR.
CHICKEN-- MR.
SMART.
IT'S AN INTRIGUING CASE, SO YOU HAVE THE COURT'S PERMISSION.
THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR.
I PLAN TO PROVE THAT I AM IN COMPLETE POSSESSION OF MY WITS.
AND SO AS MY FIRST WITNESS, I SHOULD LIKE TO CALL TO THE STAND MY OLD FRIEND AND GOOD NEIGHBOR, MRS.
HARRIET EULALIE DAWSON.
NOW, MRS.
DAWSON, EXACTLY HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN NEIGHBORS?
TOO LONG!
I WONDER IF YOU COULD BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC?
SIX YEARS TOO LONG!
NOW, MRS.
DAWSON, I'D LIKE YOU TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT THE NEXT QUESTION THAT I'M GOING TO ASK YOU.
TAKE YOUR TIME, THINK IT OVER BEFORE YOU ANSWER.
IN ALL THE YEARS THAT WE HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER HAS THERE BEEN ANY TIME THAT I HAVE EVER GIVEN YOU CAUSE OR REASON TO SUSPECT MY SANITY?
NEXT WITNESS, YOUR HONOR.
NOW YOU ARE THE CHIEF OF CONTROL.
- IS THAT CORRECT?
- THAT IS CORRECT.
WOULD YOU KINDLY TELL THIS COURT YOUR COMPLETE AND FULL NAME?
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T.
THAT'S CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
THEN TELL THE COURT YOUR FIRST NAME.
MY IDENTITY IS CLASS-A SECURITY.
COME ON, CHIEF, TELL US YOUR FIRST NAME.
CHIEF, IT CAN'T HURT TO GIVE JUST YOUR FIRST NAME!
THADDEUS.
- THADDEUS?
-  SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
HOW MANY CASES HAVE I WORKED ON FOR CONTROL?
I'D SAY MORE THAN 100.
AND HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE MY SERVICES AS A SECRET SERVICE AGENT?
NOW LET ME ASK YOU THIS QUESTION-- AND CHIEF, TRY AND KEEP YOUR ANSWERS BRIEF.
IN ALL OF THOSE CASES WAS THERE ANY TIME WHEN YOU WISHED THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE ELSE ON THE CASE BESIDES ME?
LET ME SEE IF I CAN THINK OF A QUESTION THAT YOU CAN ANSWER.
WHAT IS MY NAME?
Chief: MAXWELL SMART.
THANK YOU, THADDEUS, YOU CAN STEP DOWN.
AND NOW, YOUR HONOR-- MR.
SMART, IF YOU CAN SHOW THAT THIS UNUSUAL LINE OF QUESTIONING HAS ANY DIRECT BEARING ON YOUR CASE-- I'M GETTING TO THAT, YOUR HONOR.
I HAVE HERE IN MY HAND, EXHIBIT "C"-- THE CHICKEN HEAD MASK THAT I WORE ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION.
AND I WOULD LIKE TO PUT THIS MASK ON AND RECREATE THE EVENTS OF THAT EVENING.
YOUR HONOR, I OBJECT!
HE'S TURNING THIS HEARING INTO A CIRCUS.
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, YOUR HONOR.
MR.
SMART, IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, REMOVE THAT RIDICULOUS CHICKEN HEAD SO THAT I CAN SEE YOUR FACE!
BUT YOUR HONOR, I'M SURE THAT IF I COULD-- OF COURSE!
THAT'S IT!
YOUR HONOR, I SHOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF CALLING ONE LAST WITNESS TO THE STAND.
ALL RIGHT, SMART.
ONE MORE WITNESS.
AND THEN DID YOU, OR DID YOU NOT RUSH ACROSS THAT CROWDED ROOM AND SHOUT, "I KNOW THAT MAN, IT'S MAXWELL SMART"?
YES, I DID.
BUT HOW COULD YOU HAVE POSSIBLY RECOGNIZED ME WHEN MY FACE WAS COMPLETELY HIDDEN BY THIS CHICKEN MASK?
- WELL, I-- - AND WHAT'S MORE, WHAT MAN WOULD DRINK PUNCH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE POISON?
ONLY A MAN WHO KNEW THERE WAS NO POISON IN THE FIRST PLACE; A MAN WHOSE WHOLE SCHEME WAS TO DISCREDIT ME AND MY TESTIMONY IN THIS COURTROOM; A MAN WHO TRIED TO TAMPER WITH A FEDERAL WITNESS.
AND IF MY CALCULATIONS ARE CORRECT, YOU ARE THAT MAN; A MAN WHO OWES HIS ALLEGIANCE TO KAOS.
WELL, YOUR HONOR, MY CASE IS COMPLETE.
THIS IS YOUR VILLAIN.
THIS IS YOUR CULPRIT AND THIS IS HIS GUN.
STAY BACK!
GET OVER THERE, BAILIFF!
- KEEP YOUR HANDS UP!
- YOU'RE CRAZY!
YOU'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THE GUARDS AT THE DOOR!
I HAVE MY OWN MEANS OF ESCAPE!
MR.
SMART, I MUST SAY THAT YOUR LOGIC WAS QUITE BRILLIANT.
HOWEVER, I REGRET I CAN'T STAY HERE AND HELP YOU CELEBRATE YOUR VICTORY.
I'M AFRAID I MUST-- I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE OF YOU NOW!
DON'T BE A FOOL!
IT'S FIVE STORIES STRAIGHT DOWN TO A HARD PAVEMENT.
- I'M IN A HURRY!
- OH.
WELL, THAT IS THE QUICKEST WAY DOWN.
YOU REALLY THINK I'M STUPID ENOUGH TO JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW FIVE STORIES HIGH WITHOUT HAVING TAKEN CERTAIN SAFETY PRECAUTIONS?
BELOW THIS WINDOW IS A KAOS TRUCK FULL OF MATTRESSES.
WELL, GENTLEMEN, FAREWELL!
Judge: ORDER ORDER ORDER!
MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH.
WAIT A MINUTE!
DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO FIX MY BREAKFAST!
OH, HI, CHIEF!
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
WHAT'S UP?
THE TRIAL DATE HAS BEEN SET, MAX.
WE'VE REALLY GOT KAOS ON THE RUN THIS TIME, - THANKS TO YOU.
- NO THANKS NECESSARY.
OH, YES THEY ARE.
I'M AFRAID I LOST FAITH IN YOU FOR A LITTLE WHILE THERE, BUT-- I MUST SAY, THOSE KAOS BOYS DID A REMARKABLE JOB OF MAKING YOU LOOK LIKE YOU WERE CRACKING UP.
I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY, CHIEF.
YOU KNOW, MAX, IT'S AMAZING HOW MUCH YOU DID SEEM TO THINK YOU WERE A CHICKEN.
YOU KNOW, CHIEF, THERE WERE TIMES WHEN I REALLY THOUGHT I WAS A CHICKEN.
-  - EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
- MY TEA IS READY.
- YEAH.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
TAKE IT EASY, CHIEF.
NOW WATCH YOUR STEP.
SOMEDAY, MAX, SOMEDAY I'D LIKE TO LEAVE MY APARTMENT BY THE FRONT DOOR.
THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE NECESSARY, CHIEF.
AFTER ALL, YOU'RE A VERY IMPORTANT MAN AND WE NEVER KNOW WHAT THE ENEMY IS GONNA TRY AND DO NEXT.
I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER IT DOESN'T SEEM DIGNIFIED.
SECURITY FIRST, CHIEF.
ANYWAY, I CERTAINLY HOPE YOU HAVE A NICE VACATION.
- YOU'VE GOT A GOOD REST COMING TO YOU.
- THANK YOU, MAX.
- SEE YOU ON MONDAY.
- YOU SURE YOU'VE GOT EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING, CHIEF.
YOU CAN COUNT ON ME.
- OH!
- OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
NEVER MIND, MAX.
JUST PUT THE BAGS IN THE TRUNK.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
NO SOONER SAID THAN DONE.
-  - CHIEF, HAVE YOU GOT A KEY-- WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHIEF.
CAN'T YOU GET IT STARTED?
- DOESN'T SEEM TO TURN OVER.
-  WELL, NOW I DON'T CLAIM TO BE AN EXPERT ON THESE THINGS, BUT I'M WILLING TO MAKE A LARGE WAGER THAT I KNOW JUST WHERE THE TROUBLE IS.
- WHERE, MAX?
- THE ENGINE.
GOOD THINKING.
YOU WANT TO TAKE A LOOK THERE?
- WHERE?
- IN THE ENGINE.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
OKAY, TRY HER NOW.
MAX.
MAX!
CARBURETOR.
MAX, COME ON!
MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD NOW.
- YOU'RE GETTING A BACKFIRE.
- MAX!
MAX!
HELP ME!
OKAY, CHIEF.
I'LL JUST TAKE THESE SUITCASES AND PUT 'EM IN THE TRUNK.
-  - CHIEF!
CHIEF, YOU FORGOT YOUR LUGGAGE!
HURRY, HURRY, HURRY.
I'M SORRY, WINDISH, BUT I JUST CAN'T SUBSCRIBE TO THE THEORY THAT THE CHIEF MET WITH FOUL PLAY.
NOW LET'S FACE THE FACTS, 86.
THE AUTOMOBILE WAS FOUND ABANDONED 10 MILES AWAY ABOUT TWO HOURS AGO.
WE WENT OVER THE CAR VERY THOROUGHLY, MAX, AND WE FOUND A FEW THINGS.
- THEY'RE IN HERE.
- OH, THANK YOU, 99.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE'VE GOT HERE.
STRANDS OF HAIR, ODD-SHAPED PIECE OF METAL BUTTON AND THIS PIECE OF PAPER.
OKAY, WINDISH, NOW FOR A LITTLE BASIC DETECTIVE WORK.
- THIS SHOULD BE INTERESTING.
- GO AHEAD, MAX.
- WHAT'S YOUR CONCLUSION, MAX?
- THE CHIEF HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.
MAY I ASK WHICH ONE OF THESE ITEMS LED YOU TO THAT CONCLUSION?
- THIS INNOCENT-LOOKING PIECE OF PAPER.
- WHY, MAX?
WHAT IS IT?
A RANSOM NOTE.
THEY WANT $200,000 FOR THE CHIEF, OR THEY'RE GOING TO KILL HIM.
NOW WHERE ARE WE GOING TO GET THAT KIND OF MONEY?
COULDN'T WE ASK THE GOVERNMENT FOR HELP?
ORGANIZATION.
NOT EVEN THE STATE DEPARTMENT KNOWS ABOUT US.
WE JUST CAN'T GO RUNNING TO THEM EVERY TIME WE'VE GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM.
THEN WHAT ABOUT CONGRESS, MAX?
THEY COULD PUT THROUGH A SPECIAL APPROPRIATION.
- HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE?
- THREE MONTHS.
- WELL, WHAT IF IT WAS AN EMERGENCY?
- FOUR MONTHS.
- FORGET IT.
- I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, MAX.
IT'S JUST THAT I'M SO WORRIED ABOUT OUR CHIEF.
WELL, I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE CHIEF TOO, 99.
MY GOSH.
THERE'S NO ONE FONDER OF THE CHIEF THAN I AM AND NO ONE CLOSER TO THE CHIEF.
BUT $200,000 AFTER ALL, HE IS A USED CHIEF.
MAX, MAYBE THIS IS SOMETHING THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE RIGHT TO THE TOP.
YOU MEAN, CALL HIM?
OH, I COULDN'T DO THAT, 99.
MAYBE I CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH ONE OF HIS AIDES.
MAX, IT'S GOT TO BE HIM.
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT'S JUST THAT I HATE TO BOTHER HIM.
HE HAS SO MANY PROBLEMS NOW.
WELL, I'LL USE THE HOTLINE.
HELLO, SIR?
UH, THIS IS MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86 FROM CONTROL.
UH, FINE, THANK YOU, SIR.
UH, SIR, I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, BUT, UH, OUR CHIEF HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED.
YES, WE THINK IT'S A SHAME TOO, SIR.
WELL, THEY WANT $200,000 FOR HIS RETURN, AND WE THOUGHT PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP US.
OH.
WELL, THANK YOU, SIR.
THAT'S VERY NICE OF YOU.
WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT.
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU.
WHAT DID HE SAY, MAX?
HE SAID TO PUT HIM DOWN FOR $12.
YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS, WHOEVER YOU ARE.
I'M SORRY.
I NEGLECTED TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.
MY NAME IS SATAN-- HARVEY SATAN.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HOLD ME HERE BEFORE MY MEN FIND ME?
THEY'LL NEVER FIND YOU HERE.
MY PRIVATE SANATORIUM IS TOO WELL HIDDEN.
BESIDES, YOU'LL BE BACK IN YOUR CONTROL HEADQUARTERS SOON ENOUGH, AFTER THEY'VE PAID YOUR RANSOM.
YOU MEAN THIS IS JUST A KIDNAPPING?
NO, NOT JUST A KIDNAPPING.
AFTER YOUR ORGANIZATION HAS PAID THE $200,000 WE'RE ASKING FOR YOU, WE'LL SEND YOU BACK TO THEM, AND YOU'LL BE IN PERFECT HEALTH, BUT YOU'LL BE WORKING FOR KAOS.
THERE IS NO WAY YOU CAN FORCE ME TO WORK FOR KAOS.
AS WE SPEAK, AT THIS VERY MOMENT, A CERTAIN DR.
LAZLO VON HAVOC IS ON A PLANE FROM EUROPE.
I'VE NEVER MET THE MAN, BUT I'VE BEEN LED TO BELIEVE THAT HE CAN PERFORM THE MOST INCREDIBLE OPERATION THAT WILL TURN YOU INTO OUR WILLING SLAVE.
IMAGINE, RUDOLPH-- THE CHIEF OF CONTROL A KAOS MAN.
THE DOOR, RUDOLPH.
YOUR NEW QUARTERS.
RUDOLPH WHY ARE YOU PUTTING ME IN THERE?
WE HAVE TO LOWER YOUR BODY TEMPERATURE FOR THE OPERATION TONIGHT.
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO UNCOMFORTABLE.
MY ADVICE TO YOU, CHIEF, IS TRY TO STAY COOL.
Max: WE'LL NEVER GET $200,000.
THE LAB TECHNICIANS.
"43.50-- LAB".
WOW!
HERE'S ONE FOR $500!
$500?
NOW THAT'S GREAT.
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEPLACE.
WHO'S THAT FROM?
- THE BOYS IN COUNTERFEITING.
- "COUNTERFEIT--" ONLY A FEW MORE CHANCES LEFT ON OUR PUNCHBOARD.
TAKE A CHANCE ON OUR CHIEF.
GET THEM NOW.
ONLY A FEW MORE LEFT.
-  - THAT'S THE CHIEF'S SPECIAL PHONE.
- SHOULD WE ANSWER IT?
- THAT'S HIS PRIVATE WIRE.
I'M GOING TO ANSWER IT.
MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86 HERE.
WOULD YOU MIND REPEATING THAT PLEASE?
Satan: I said I'm speaking for your chief.
If you wish to see him again alive, pay close attention to my instructions.
- GET A TRACER ON THIS CALL, HODGKINS.
- Don't do it, Hodgkins.
- GO AHEAD, HODGKINS.
- Stay there, Hodgkins.
At 8:00 this evening, one of your agents will take the ransom money and carry it in a suitcase into Municipal Park.
Enter the park by the southwest entrance and keep walking.
You'll receive further instructions in the park.
One agent, no more, or your chief will be killed.
WAIT A MINUTE.
HOW DO WE KNOW YOU REALLY HAVE THE CHIEF?
Well, who else knows about his abduction besides you and me?
- All right, Hodgkins, you can go now.
-  - YES, SIR.
- HODGKINS, COME BACK HERE.
GET A BRIEFCASE AND FILL IT WITH ALL THE MONEY WE'VE COLLECTED.
- AND DON'T WASTE ANY TIME.
THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE.
- YES, 86.
- WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, MAX?
- I'M GOING INTO THAT PARK.
- ALONE?
- ALONE.
BUT, MAX, YOU'LL BE IN TERRIBLE DANGER.
I KNOW.
THOSE PARKS ARE MURDER AT NIGHT.
Satan: DON'T TURN AROUND.
TAKE TWO STEPS BACKWARDS.
THE BRIEFCASE.
JUST A MINUTE.
HOW DO I KNOW WE'LL GET THE CHIEF BACK?
DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL GET HIM.
SATAN ALWAYS KEEPS HIS WORD.
SATAN?
HARVEY SATAN OF KAOS?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- HMM, I THOUGHT HE WAS IN JAIL.
WASN'T HE CONVICTED OF ARSON, TREASON, INSURRECTION AND MASS MURDER?
HE GOT TIME OFF FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.
- DON'T TRY TO FOLLOW ME.
- DON'T WORRY, I WOULDN'T THINK OF IT.
HELLO, CONTROL CENTRAL?
THIS IS AGENT 86.
STAND BY TO EXECUTE CHECKPOINT TRACKING PLAN ON HARVEY SATAN.
ARE ALL OUR AGENTS AT THEIR PROPER CHECKPOINTS?
GOOD.
I'M PUTTING A HOLD ON MY SHOE AND SWITCHING TO MY WALLET.
HELLO, CHECKPOINT CHARLIE?
IS THAT YOU, 99?
PICK UP SUSPECT AT WEST STREET EXIT.
YES, THAT WOULD BE NORTH ON LEONARD STREET.
UH-HUH.
HE'S IN HIS CAR?
GOOD.
HELLO, CENTRAL?
I'M SWITCHING TO MY EYEGLASSES.
PUT A HOLD ON MY WALLET, BUT KEEP MY SHOE OPEN.
HELLO, CHECKPOINT BAKER?
SUSPECT IS HEADING YOUR WAY.
WHERE?
EAST ON WYCKOFF AVENUE, EH?
ALL RIGHT, MOVE OUT AT A SAFE DISTANCE.
CONTROL CENTRAL, I'M SWITCHING TO MY TIE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
HELLO?
HELLO, CONTROL CENTRAL?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
OH, MY TIE IS BUSY.
WELL, UH, PUT ME ON MY HANDKERCHIEF, EXTENSION FOUR.
NEVER MIND THE HANDKERCHIEF, CENTRAL.
MY BELT IS RINGING.
HELLO?
CHECKPOINT EASY?
YES.
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.
HOLD ON.
HELLO, CENTRAL?
CANCEL MY HANDKERCHIEF, HOLD MY GLASSES, CUT OFF MY SHOE, AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THAT GUY OFF MY TIE.
HELLO?
HELLO?
HELLO, ZEBRA?
LISTEN, THERE'S A LITTLE STATIC ON MY GARTER.
COULD YOU SPEAK UP?
AH, GOOD.
THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
UH-HUH.
THE CAR HAS PULLED UP TO A PRIVATE SANATORIUM?
HMM.
THAT MUST BE SATAN'S HIDEOUT.
WHAT'S THE NAME OF THE SANATORIUM?
I SHOULD'VE GUESSED IT.
"SATAN PLACE".
IT LOOKS IMPENETRABLE, MAX.
I KNOW, 99, BUT IT'S THE ONLY WAY.
WE CAN'T FORCE OUR WAY IN OR THEY'LL KILL THE CHIEF.
- I THINK WE'D BETTER TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AROUND.
- RIGHT.
- I'LL CHECK THE WALL.
- WATCH IT, 99!
- HAVE YOU GOT A HAIRPIN?
- NO.
- I'VE GOT ONE.
- MAX!
I USE IT FOR PICKING LOCKS.
STAND BACK, 99.
JUST AS I THOUGHT-- ELECTRIC GRASS.
NOW HOW ARE WE GONNA GET IN THERE?
I KNOW.
WHAT ABOUT THE GREEN VOLT MANEUVER?
HMM, THAT MIGHT JUST WORK.
UH-HUH.
LOOK, 99.
HERE'S THE WIRE.
AND HERE'S THE PLUG.
LOOK.
NO WONDER WE COULDN'T FIND IT.
THE NIGHT LIGHT FELL OUT.
GET OVER THAT WALL.
IT'S TOO HIGH TO JUMP.
WHAT HAVE WE GOT IN THE TOOL KIT?
UM OH, TRY THIS, MAX.
HOW AM I GONNA GET OVER THE WALL WITH A TELESCOPE?
THAT'S NOT A TELESCOPE, MAX.
IT'S A VAULTING POLE.
- OH, GOOD.
I'LL GO FIRST, AND YOU FOLLOW ME.
- RIGHT.
- WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT, 99?
- THESE CATERPILLAR SHOES.
OH, GOOD.
THESE SUCTION CUPS WILL FIT TO PRACTICALLY ANYTHING.
I'LL TAKE THEM-- MAX, LOOK OUT.
IT'S A TAXICAB.
-  - THERE ARE TWO PEOPLE GETTING OUT.
THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY.
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.
- KNOCK THIS INTO THE BUSHES AND COVER IT.
- RIGHT.
GET BEHIND THIS TREE.
- WHAT IS IT, DOCTOR?
-  LET ME SEE YOUR FLASHLIGHT.
I THINK THIS TAXI DRIVER SHORTCHANGED ME.
Woman: I HOPE MR.
SATAN HAS PREPARED THE PATIENT FOR SURGERY, DR.
VON HAVOC.
I'M SURE HE HAS.
I'VE GIVEN HIM FULL INSTRUCTIONS.
- BY PHONE?
- NO, I'VE NEVER TALKED TO THE MAN.
WE ALWAYS COMMUNICATE BY MAIL.
PARDON ME, - ARE YOU LOOKING FOR HARVEY SATAN?
- WHY, YES.
- WOULD YOU STEP THIS WAY, PLEASE?
- WHICH WAY?
DAT VAY.
- 99, RING THE BELL.
- RIGHT.
GOOD EVENING.
I AM DR.
VON HAVOC, AND THIS IS MY ASSISTANT.
WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU, DOCTOR.
PLEASE, HURRY.
SATAN WANTS TO GET THIS OVER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING ACCORDING TO THE INSTRUCTIONS WE RECEIVED FROM KAOS, DR.
VON HAVOC.
AH, THAT IS GOOD, THAT IS GOOD.
YOU HAVE DONE WELL, MR.
SATAN.
I ALWAYS DO WELL, DR, VON HAVOC.
YOUR PATIENT IS READY.
HIS BODY TEMPERATURE IS PRECISELY AS REQUESTED.
AH, THAT IS GOOD.
WHERE IS THE PATIENT?
BRING HIM IN, PLEASE.
RUDOLPH, GREGOR.
AH.
YES, OF COURSE.
NOT MUCH OF A SPECIMEN, MR.
SATAN, BUT WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN.
AND NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND, GENTLEMEN, MY ASSISTANT AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE LEFT ALONE WITH THE PATIENT.
CERTAINLY, DR.
VON HAVOC.
RUDOLPH.
-  - LOOK, 99.
HE'S FROZEN SOLID.
- POOR CHIEF!
- LET'S GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
RIGHT.
CHIEF?
IT'S ME, MAX.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
MAX, WHY DON'T YOU TRY TO CONTACT HEADQUARTERS?
HMM, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, 99.
I'LL CALL THEM ON MY SHOE, AND YOU BREATHE HEAVILY ON THE CHIEF.
HELLO, CONTROL HEADQUARTERS?
SMART HERE.
HOW SOON CAN YOU MOVE IN ON SATAN PLACE?
GOOD.
BRING ROPES, GUNS, OF HOT COFFEE.
- HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR COFFEE, 99?
- UH, CREAM AND SUGAR.
ONE WITH CREAM AND SUGAR AND ONE BLACK.
HOW ABOUT YOU, CHIEF?
- MM.
- UH, CANCEL ONE OF THE COFFEES AND MAKE IT TEA.
RIGHT.
WELL, THEY'LL BE HERE IN 10 MINUTES.
WE'VE GOT TO STALL UNTIL THEY GET HERE.
OH, MAX, HE'LL NEVER BE THAWED OUT IN TIME.
WELL, WE'LL JUST HAVE TO TRY AND TAKE HIM OUT THE WAY HE IS.
RIGHT.
- CAREFUL.
YOU'LL CRACK HIM.
- WELL, DOCTORS?
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
- AH, MR.
SATAN!
HOW FORTUNATE YOU ARRIVED JUST IN TIME.
THE PRISONER WAS TRYING TO ESCAPE.
RIGHT.
WE CAUGHT HIM JUST IN TIME.
HOW COULD HE MOVE WHEN HE'S FROZEN SOLID?
THAT IS NOT MY PROBLEM.
I AM JUST THE DOCTOR HERE.
YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK HIM THAT YOURSELF.
AND NOW IF YOU GENTLEMEN DON'T MIND, I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD PUT THE PATIENT ON THE OPERATING TABLE.
YES, RUDOLPH.
PUT THE PATIENT ON THE OPERATING TABLE.
WE'VE GOT TO DELAY THE OPERATION UNTIL I CAN FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
MOST PECULIAR, RUDOLPH.
MOST PECULIAR.
GREGOR, I WANT YOU TO WATCH THE DOCTOR CLOSELY.
- RUDOLPH, GO OUT AND CHECK THE GROUNDS.
- YES, SIR.
DOCTOR, I WANT YOUR PATIENT OUT OF HERE WITHIN THE HOUR.
- UH, WHAT HAPPENED TO THAT OTHER MAN, RUDOLPH?
- OUT ON THE GROUNDS.
I SENT HIM OUT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS IN ORDER.
WELL, DOCTOR, ARE YOU READY TO BEGIN?
UH, YES, WE'LL BEGIN JUST AS SOON AS THE DOCTOR WASHES HIS HANDS.
MY HANDS?
AH, YES, OF COURSE!
MY HANDS.
I WILL COMMENCE WITH THE OPERATION AS SOON AS I HAVE WASHED MY HANDS.
I DON'T SUPPOSE I HAVE TIME TO BRUSH MY TEETH?
AH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.
AMERICANS!
EVERYTHING IS RUSH RUSH RUSH!
NO WONDER YOU NEVER GET ANYTHING DONE.
ACTUALLY, THIS ROOM IS NOT COLD ENOUGH FOR THE OPERATION.
- YOUR GLOVES, DOCTOR.
- AH, GOOD.
- WHY'D YOU TURN THE TEMPERATURE DOWN?
- I CAN'T EXPLAIN NOW.
JUST KEEP STALLING, AND WHEN I GIVE YOU THE SIGNAL, TURN ON THAT FAUCET WITH THE HOSE ATTACHED.
- RIGHT.
- AH!
- NOW IF WE CAN JUST TAKE THE PATIENT'S TEMPERATURE.
- OH, RIGHT.
- YOUR THERMOMETER, DOCTOR.
- AH, GOOD.
SWEEP THAT UP AND PUT IT UNDER THE PATIENT'S TONGUE.
UH, NEVER MIND THE THERMOMETER, NURSE.
I THINK IT IS TIME TO GET ON WITH THE OPERATION.
NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST LAY OUT THE INSTRUMENTS.
- HERE WE GO.
- AH, GOOD.
AH!
BUT THEY ARE NOT IN THE RIGHT PLACES.
THIS IS THE EUROPEAN STYLE.
THIS OPERATION IS ON THE AMERICAN PLAN.
I WILL SHOW YOU.
DOCTOR, I THINK YOU'D BETTER OPERATE RIGHT NOW.
HE CAN'T OPERATE.
HE'S NOT DR.
VON HAVOC.
I FOUND DR.
VON HAVOC AND HIS ASSISTANT OUTSIDE THE WALL.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
I AM NOT DR.
VON HAVOC.
I'M MAXWELL SMART, SECRET AGENT 86.
NOW, 99!
- IT WORKED, 99!
- WHAT GAVE YOU THE IDEA, MAX?
THE FROZEN WATER IN THIS SINK.
THAT'S THE END OF SATAN PLACE.
YES, AND THAT'S THE END OF THOSE THREE HARDENED CRIMINALS.
MAX, WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE IF YOUR PLAN TO FREEZE THEM HADN'T WORKED?
- I HAD AN ALTERNATE PLAN.
- WHAT WAS THAT?
I WAS GOING TO GO RIGHT AHEAD AND OPERATE ON THE CHIEF.
WELL, CHIEF, WHO DOES IT FEEL TO BE BACK SAFE AND WARM IN YOUR OWN OFFICE AGAIN?
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE'S MY PAINTING?
WHERE'S MY DESK SET?
- MY CHAIR!
- IT'S ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.
IT'S JUST THAT WE HAD TO RAISE THE MONEY FOR YOUR RANSOM.
YOU SOLD ALL MY OFFICE FURNITURE?
AUCTIONED, CHIEF.
NOT SOLD.
WELL, WHERE'S THE $200,000?
WELL, WE DIDN'T QUITE GET THAT MUCH, CHIEF.
AM I GETTING WARM?
WELL, CHIEF, LET'S LOOK AT IT THIS WAY-- UH, YOU REMEMBER TENNYSON'S POEM, "CANNONS TO THE LEFT OF THEM, CANNONS TO THE RIGHT OF THEM, INTO THE VALLEY OF DEATH RODE THE" - 600.
- RIGHT.
$600?
THAT'S ALL?
WHY DON'T YOU GO HOME AND GET SOME REST?
YOU'LL GET A LITTLE SLEEP, YOU'LL GET WARM, AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT ON MONDAY.
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.
HAVE THEM SEND AROUND MY CAR.
- UH, MY CAR, CHIEF.
- WHAT?
- I WON IT IN THE RAFFLE.
I WON IT FAIR AND SQUARE.
- YOU WON MY CAR?
YEAH, BUT THAT'S OKAY, CHIEF.
YOU CAN HAVE IT ON WEEKNIGHTS.
HE WANTS TO GO BACK TO THE ICEBOX.
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
THIS Z.F.B. 600 HAS JUST BEEN DEVELOPED BY OUR ARMORY, 86.
IT COSTS $32,000.
- $32,000?
- RIGHT.
HOW MANY MILES DO YOU GET TO THE GALLON, CHIEF?
THIS IS A TRIUMPH OF AUTOMOTIVE ENGINEERING AND THE MOST INGENIOUSLY CONCEIVED FIGHTING MACHINE IN EXISTENCE.
THE HORN MECHANISM OPERATES TWO .
50 CALIBER MACHINE GUNS MOUNTED IN THE RADIATOR.
UH, WHAT'S THIS, CHIEF?
THAT'S A RADAR-OPERATED TRACKING DEVICE.
UH, CHIEF, HOW MUCH CAN YOU GIVE ME ON MY OLD CAR?
YOU PULL THE LIGHT SWITCH OUT AND TURN IT TO THE LEFT, THE CAR SENDS OUT A HIGH-FREQUENCY EMERGENCY SIGNAL.
UH, WHAT'S THIS, CHIEF?
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK IT'S THE WINDSHIELD WASHER.
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAX, YOU HAVE THE NEWEST, MOST EFFICIENT WEAPON IN THE SERVICE.
HOW DO YOU LIKE IT?
UH, CHIEF, COULD I SEE IT IN A TAN?
-  - HALT!
SAUNDERS!
THAT MAN BROKE INTO THE LABORATORY AND STOLE THE IMMOBILO!
- WHAT'S THE IMMOBILO?
- IT'S A NEW DRUG, LET'S GET HIM.
CHIEF!
LET'S TAKE THE CAR.
I THINK HE'S HEADED FOR THE MAIN GATE.
WE'LL CUT HIM OFF.
- $32,000!
-   I'D BETTER GIVE THEM A LITTLE HONK, CHIEF.
- NO!
-   WHEN HE TURNED THAT CORNER I KNEW I HAD HIM, SIR.
SOLID WALL ON EITHER SIDE, LOCKED 10' GATE - AND THEN HE DID IT.
- DID WHAT, HASKELL?
JUMPED THE FENCE.
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT.
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT EITHER, SIR, BUT I SAW IT WITH MY OWN EYES.
IT WAS A SWARTHY FELLOW, LATIN TYPE.
HE WAS CARRYING SOMETHING, PROBABLY A BOTTLE.
MAX, DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE FOR A MAN TO JUMP OVER A FENCE LIKE THAT?
WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
STAND BACK.
Chief: YOU MEAN, YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO JUMP IT?
WELL, IF I CAN'T DO IT, CHANCES ARE NOBODY CAN.
YOU SEE, I HAPPEN TO BE THE THREE-TIME WINNER OF THE SPY SCHOOL GOLD MEDAL FOR HIGH JUMPING.
UH, CHIEF, I'LL NEED AN "ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO".
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET-- WAIT A MINUTE CHIEF, I'M NOT IN POSITION YET.
ON YOUR MARK, GET SET, GO!
DIDN'T I DO IT RIGHT?
WELL, CHIEF, YOUR "ON YOUR MARK" AND "GO" WERE MARVELOUS, BUT YOUR "GET SET" NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.
- I HAD A FEELING YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE IT.
- ON YOUR MARK!
GET SET, GO!
CHIEF, NO ORDINARY HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE DONE THIS.
WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST, MAX?
YOU THINK IT COULD HAVE BEEN THE WORK OF A VERY CLEVER ANIMAL?
Chief: MORNING, WINDISH.
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- ANYTHING NEW?
WHOEVER STOLE THAT DRUG CUT HIS HAND ON THE DOOR HERE.
THAT'S ABOUT ALL.
I'M GONNA USE THE HOTLINE TO MY OFFICE AND TELL HODGKINS I'M HERE.
HELLO, HODGKINS, THIS IS THE CHIEF.
I'M DOWN AT THE LAB.
RIGHT.
OH, PROFESSOR, I BELIEVE YOU KNOW 86.
UH, OF COURSE, THE WELL-KNOWN SECRET AGENT.
-  - NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN, SMART.
- IT'S MY HOTLINE.
- UH, I'LL GET IT FOR YOU, CHIEF.
WRONG PHONE.
THIS IS THE CHIEF.
YES, HODGKINS.
THANK YOU, HODGKINS.
RIGHT.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT THAT.
SHE'S TRIED TO REACH US THREE TIMES AND BROKE CONTACT EACH TIME.
- WHERE IS SHE?
- WE PLANTED HER IN NAHARANA'S DANCE TROUPE YESTERDAY MORNING.
THEY ARE HERE ON A TWO-WEEKS CULTURAL EXCHANGE TOUR.
NAHARANA REPRESENTS A FACTION IN HIS COUNTRY THAT IS NOT FAVORABLY INCLINED TO OUR GOVERNMENT.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
EMILIO NAHARANA-- - ISN'T HE THE WORLD-FAMOUS BALLET DANCER?
- CORRECT.
ARE YOU THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING?
NO, CHIEF, I'M THINKING WHAT I'M THINKING.
EMILIO NAHARANA, POTENTIAL ENEMY TO OUR COUNTRY.
- SWARTHY LATIN TYPE.
- AND ONE OF THE LASTOF THEWORLD'S GREAT LEAPERS.
MAYBE 99 HAS FOUND OUT SOMETHING.
BUT WHY WOULD HE WANT IMMOBILO?
WINDISH, ONE QUESTION.
JUST WHAT IS IMMOBILO AND HOW DOES IT WORK?
ACTUALLY, THAT'S TWO QUESTIONS.
HE'S BRIGHT.
I LIKE THAT.
- GO ON, WINDISH.
- IMMOBILO IS A RELATIVELY HARMLESS DRUG WHICH WHEN INJECTED SUBCUTANEOUSLY PUTS ITS VICTIM INTO A TEMPORARY STATE OF PARALYSIS.
TURNS HIM INTO A STATUE.
A STATUE?
- I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE THAT-- - NOW WATCH OUT, SMART-- OH, MY.
- HE'S GIVEN HIMSELF AN INJECTION - NO HARM.
A LITTLE BLOOD.
- BUT IT'S ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT.
- MY FINGERS ARE WORKING.
WHY DOESN'T THE DRUG WORK, WINDISH?
IT DOES.
HE'S THE ONLY ONE THAT IT HASN'T WORKED ON.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND IT.
- OH, SEE FOR YOURSELF, CHIEF.
ONE LITTLE STAB WITH THIS HATPIN AND YOU'RE EXACTLY THE WAY YOU WERE BEFORE.
CHIEF?
CHIEF?
IS HE GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT?
HE'LL BE FINE.
- HMM.
- WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, SMART?
I'M WONDERING JUST HOW FAR I CAN RUN IN 30 SECONDS.
WHAT PUZZLES ME IS YOUR IMMUNITY.
- WHAT DID YOU HAVE FOR BREAKFAST?
- BREAKFAST?
UH, LET'S SEE.
I HAD A BOLOGNA SANDWICH, RICE PUDDING, - LASAGNA AND A PEACH.
- RAW?
OF COURSE NOT, WINDISH, I WAS WEARING A BATHROBE.
NO, THE PEACH!
- OH, THE PEACH WAS RAW.
- THAT'S IT.
PEACH FUZZ CONTAINS AMINO ALKALIS WHICH WOULD GIVE YOU AN IMMUNITY TO IMMOBILO.
ANSWER ME, WINDISH, WHY DOESN'T THE DRUG WORK?
- BUT IT DID WORK.
YOU WERE OUT FOR A WHOLE MINUTE.
- I WAS?
YES, YOU FORGOT TO EAT A PEACH.
- I WHAT?
- IT SEEMS THAT A PEACH GIVES ONE AN IMMUNITY.
NOW YOU SEE, CHIEF, BEFORE I STAB YOU AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GET UNDRESSED, GET INTO A BATHROBE AND EAT A RAW PEACH.
GIVE ME THAT HATPIN.
NO NO NO.
JUST PUT IT DOWN ON THE TABLE AND STAY AWAY FROM ME.
- NOW THIS IS WHAT I THINK WE OUGHT TO DO.
- WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
ISN'T THIS TOP SECRET?
YES.
WELL, DON'T YOU THINK IT WOULD BE WISE TO SPEAK IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE?
ALL RIGHT.
FRENCH.
FRENCH?
GOSH, CHIEF, EVERYBODY SPEAKS FRENCH.
WHY DON'T WE SPEAK IN SWAHILI?
AS YOU WISH.
MAHANI GANGA-GE.
- GANGA-GE?
- MM-HMM.
- I THOUGHT IT WAS GANGA-GI.
- NO, GANGA-GE.
OH, THAT'S STRANGE.
I THOUGHT IT WAS "GI" AFTER "GANGA" UNLESS IT CAME BEFORE "GU".
OKAY, BUT DON'T GO TOO FAST.
AND IN CASE ANYBODY AROUND I THINK WE SHOULD GO IN THERE.
OKAY, CHIEF, I THINK WE CAN TALK WITH PRIVACY HERE.
MAX, 99 IS WITH THE NAHARANA DANCE TROUPE AT THE PINEROVIAN EMBASSY.
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO GIVE A DANCE RECITAL TONIGHT FOR THE AMBASSADOR.
-  - GOOD, THEN SHE'LL BE ABLE TO TELL US IF NAHARANA WAS MISSING FROM THE TROUPE WHEN THE IMMOBILO WAS STOLEN.
SO, YOU SEE IN THAT WAY, CHIEF, I THINK IT WILL BE A  - RIGHT, CHIEF?
- RIGHT.
NOW, I'LL NEED AN AGENT TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH HER.
YOU GOT HIM, CHIEF, THE BEST IN THE BUSINESS.
NO, MAX, I THINK I'D LIKE YOU TO DO THIS.
- WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I'VE-- -  SO, THAT'S THE WAY IT LOOKS TO ME.
RIGHT.
NOW I DON'T WANT YOU TO CARRY A GUN IN THIS CASE BECAUSE THEY MIGHT FRISK YOU AND THAT'LL BE A DEAD GIVEAWAY.
BUT I DO WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME PROTECTION.
LET'S GO BACK TO WINDISH.
WINDISH, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM.
I DON'T WANT 86 TO CARRY A GUN ON THIS CASE-- AH SMART, I'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THIS RING.
WELL, I CAN'T TAKE IT.
I HARDLY KNOW YOU.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND!
NOW THIS RING IS FILLED WITH A LARGE DOSE OF IMMOBILO.
THE LITTLE NEEDLE IN THE BASE WILL INJECT THE FLUID.
OH WELL, THANK YOU, WINDISH.
WELL, CHIEF, I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME.
MAX, I-- UH-OH, I DID IT AGAIN.
LISTEN, WINDISH, WHEN THE CHIEF COMES TO-- WINDISH?
UH-OH.
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
I'M HERE TO FIX THE AIR CONDITIONING.
WE HAVE NO AIR CONDITIONER.
OH, YES OF COURSE.
HOW STUPID OF ME, UH-- I MEANT THE ELEVATOR.
- THERE IS NO ELEVATOR.
- NO ELEVATOR.
WELL, I WAS ONLY KIDDING AROUND.
I'M THE PLUMBER.
THE PLUMBING IS FINE.
HMM.
WELL, TELL ME, IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG WITH ANYTHING AROUND HERE?
YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT WE HAVE A SHORT CIRCUIT IN THE WIRING.
NOW TELL ME, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- I'M HERE TO FIX THE WIRING.
- GOOD GOOD.
THERE'S A SHORT CIRCUIT IN THE WIRING.
YES, WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.
"NO"?
!
DON'T TELL ME "NO"!
NOBODY SAYS "NO" TO NAHARANA!
THE NEXT ONE WHO SAYS "NO" WILL SUFFER!
WHO IS THAT PERSON?
THAT IS THE ELECTRICIAN, SIR.
"THE ELECTRICIAN, SIR".
WHERE IS SENOR JULIO, THE AMBASSADOR'S SECRETARY?
- I DO NOT KNOW, SIR.
- THEN FIND HIM.
I MUST SEE THE AMBASSADOR IMMEDIATELY.
AH!
SENOR JULIO, THE MAESTRO HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR YOU.
HE'S ANXIOUS TO TALK TO THE AMBASSADOR.
THE AMBASSADOR WILL SEE NO ONE UNTIL AFTER THE PACT HAS BEEN SIGNED.
THIS IS 99 CALLING CONTROL, OVER.
HELLO 99, THIS IS 86.
CAN YOU HEAR ME?
OVER.
OH, I READ YOU LOUD AND CLEAR 86.
I THINK THEY'RE ONTO ME, OVER.
DON'T WORRY, 99, I'LL FIND YOU.
WHERE ARE YOU?
OVER.
I'M IN THE PINEROVIAN EMBASSY.
WHERE ARE YOU?
OVER.
YES, I KNOW YOU ARE IN THE PINEROVIAN EMBASSY.
I'M IN THE PINEROVIAN EMBASSY TOO.
BUT JUST WHERE IN THE PINEROVIAN EMBASSY ARE YOU?
OVER.
UH, I'M IN SMALL ROOM ON THE FIRST FLOOR FULL OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, OVER.
IS THERE A BASS FIDDLE IN THE ROOM?
OVER.
YES, THERE IS.
OVER.
IS THERE A BASS DRUM IN THE ROOM?
OVER.
OH, YES THERE IS, OVER.
NOW LISTEN CAREFULLY AND DO EXACTLY WHAT I TELL YOU, 99.
GET UP VERY SLOWLY AND LOOK OVER THE DRUM.
DO YOU SEE A DARK-HAIRED MAN IN A WHITE SUIT?
YES, I DO.
DON'T BE SCARED, 99.
I THINK IT'S ME.
- MAX!
- 99!
WHY HAVE YOU BEEN BREAKING CONTACT WITH CONTROL?
IT'S NAHARANA.
HE KEEPS US DANCING EVERY MINUTE.
- EVERY TIME-- - NEVER MIND ABOUT THAT, 99.
WE THINK THAT NAHARANA STOLE A DRUG CALLED IMMOBILO FROM CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.
WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS, HAS NAHARANA BEEN MISSING FROM THE TROUPE AT ANY TIME DURING THE PAST 12 HOURS?
YES, HE LEFT AT 9:00 AND HE CAME BACK AT 11:30.
HMM, THAT FIGURES.
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL OR DIFFERENT ABOUT HIM WHEN HE RETURNED?
NO OH, WAIT, YES!
HE HAD A BANDAGE TIED AROUND HIS RIGHT INDEX FINGER.
OF COURSE, THAT'S PERFECT.
NAHARANA IS OUR MAN.
COME HERE, 99.
I WANT YOU TO EAT THIS PEACH.
OH, PEACH-- UM, I DON'T LIKE PEACHES, MAX, DO YOU HAVE A BANANA?
NO, EAT A PEACH, 99.
I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.
WHY WOULD NAHARANA WANT THE IMMOBILO?
WELL, I'M NOT SURE, BUT I THINK HE PLANS TO USE IT ON SOMEONE AND IT'S UP TO US TO FIND OUT WHO AND WHEN.
- "WHOM".
- WHOM?
- ARE YOU SURE, 99?
- I'M POSITIVE.
WHOM AND WHEN?
THAT DOESN'T SOUND RIGHT TO ME.
BUT "WHOM" IS THE OBJECTIVE.
IF YOU USE "WHO" THAT'S THE SUBJECT--   THAT MUST BE NAHARANA.
WHO IS IN THERE?
UH-- JUST A MINUTE PLEASE, I'M DRESSING.
WELL WELL, HURRY UP THERE, WE HAVE NEED OF THIS CHAMBER.
HURRY UP IN THERE!
- HURRY UP, COME ON OUT.
- MAX, LOOK, THE DRUM.
I'D LIKE TO HANDLE THIS.
-  - 99, I CAN HIDE BEHIND THE DRUM.
- RIGHT.
THEY'LL SEE YOU THERE.
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO CUT MY WAY INSIDE OF IT.
HURRY UP IN THERE!
HURRY UP!
- UH, IT'S ALL RIGHT NOW.
- BACK TO REHEARSAL.
JULIO, COME INSIDE.
OH, SHUT THE DOOR, SHUT THE DOOR.
TELL ME QUICKLY, TELL ME EVERYTHING.
- THEY HAVE CHANGED THE TIME FOR THE SIGNING OF THE PACT.
- WHAT?
INSTEAD OF THIS EVENING THEY ARE SIGNING IT THIS AFTERNOON.
THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR IS ON HIS WAY NOW.
AND THE PACT MUST BE SIGNED BEFORE 4:00.
BEFORE 4:00?
!
THAT IS IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES.
WE MUST ACT NOW!
- BUT-- BUT MAESTRO-- - OH, "BUT BUT BUT".
ALWAYS WITH YOU THIS "BUT BUT BUT".
NO BUTS!
NO BUTS!
IF THAT MUTUAL TRADE PACT IS SIGNED AND THE UNITED STATES PROVIDES JOBS FOR OUR PEOPLE, THEY WILL NOT NEED US, NO-- WE CAN OVERTHROW THE GOVERNMENT ONLY WHEN THE PEOPLE ARE POOR -  - TIRED AND HUNGRY!
WE'RE TO KILL THE AMBASSADOR?
NO NO, WE MUST NOT MAKE A MARTYR OF HIM.
BESIDES, KILLING HIM WOULD DO NO GOOD.
THE UNITED STATES WOULD SIMPLY EXTEND THE PACT UNTIL OUR COUNTRY COULD SEND ANOTHER AMBASSADOR TO SIGN IT.
WHAT DO WE DO?
DON HERNANDO IS WAITING THERE RIGHT NOW, READY TO SIGN.
YOU MUST GET ME IN TO SEE HIM.
I WILL CONVINCE HIM TO DELAY THE SIGNING OF THE PACT UNTIL WE HAVE DANCED THE NATIONAL ANTHEM OF OUR COUNTRY.
THAT WAY IT WILL GIVE ME TIME TO DEVISE A WAY TO INJECT HIM WITH THE IMMOBILO.
AND THEN YOU WILL GO TO THE UNITED STATES AMBASSADOR AND SAY THAT WE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO SIGN.
THE PACT WILL BE VOID - AND WE WILL TAKE OVER OUR COUNTRY!
-  - NO TIME TO LOSE.
- OH, INCIDENTALLY..
- THAT REPAIRMAN.
- WHAT REPAIRMAN?
WELL, DID YOU NOT SEND FOR A REPAIRMAN?
- NO.
- YOU DIDN'T?
WELL, THEN LOOK FOR A MAN IN WHITE OVERALLS.
DETAIN HIM!
IF YOU HAVE TO, KILL HIM!
LET'S GO!
MAX, WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
I FOUND OUT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT, 99.
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
- A HUMAN BEING CAN'T LIVE IN A BASS DRUM.
BUT WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THEIR PLANS?
WELL, NAHARANA PLANS TO GET VERY CLOSE TO THE AMBASSADOR AND INJECT HIM WITH BOOM-BOOM-- EH, IMMOBILO.
OH, WELL, HOW IS HE GONNA DO IT?
WHAT'S HE GONNA USE?
WELL, I'M NOT QUITE SURE, GET OUT OF THIS UNIFORM OR I'M A DEAD REPAIRMAN.
WAIT!
I THINK THEY'RE COMING BACK.
QUICK!
GET BACK IN THE DRUM!
UH, 99-- I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE JUST GIVE OURSELVES UP?
QUICK!
OH, I'M SORRY, I MUST BE IN THE WRONG ROOM.
OH, UH-- WAIT!
UH, COME ON IN.
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR SOMEONE JUST LIKE YOU.
UH, HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?
AH.
AND HOW TALL ARE YOU?
ABOUT 5'9".
UH-HUH, THAT'S JUST ABOUT PERFECT.
WELL, IT'S NOT PERFECT.
HI, THERE.
I'M SECRET AGENT 86.
WHAT DID YOU DO TO HIM?
IMMOBILO IN THIS RING.
THAT'S MARVELOUS.
NOW YOU'D BETTER GET OUTSIDE BEFORE THEY MISS YOU.
- I'VE GOT TO GET OUT OF THIS UNIFORM.
- RIGHT.
WHO ARE YOU?
SECRET AGENT 86.
VERY GOOD GIRLS!
VERY GOOD!
NOW HURRY!
UPSTAIRS ALL OF YOU!
HURRY HURRY HURRY, HURRY HURRY HURRY.
VERY GOOD.
YOU TOO, GENTLEMEN.
YOU ARE TO DANCE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM.
WAIT A MOMENT, I WANT TO FIND OUT SOMETHING.
EACH ONE OF YOU EXECUTE A LEAP.
YEAH, THAT IS A DANCER.
THAT IS A DANCER.
THAT IS A DANCER.
WAIT, YOU!
A LEAP AND SPLIT.
AFTER HIM!
AFTER HIM!
AFTER HIM!
SENOR PARKERSON, I WILL SIGN THE PACT WHEN NAHARANA HAS DANCED OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM.
- BUT YOUR EXCELLENCY-- - A CUSTOM OF OUR COUNTRY.
YOUR EXCELLENCY!
YOU MUST EAT THIS PEACH BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE!
WHO ARE YOU?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I'M A SECRET AGENT, I'M HERE TO PROTECT YOU.
A SECRET AGENT?
WHERE ARE YOUR CREDENTIALS?
UH, MY CREDENTIALS-- WELL, I LEFT THEM IN MY MUSTACHE KIT, BUT THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT YOU'VE GOT TO EAT THIS PEACH.
YOU'LL SAVE YOUR COUNTRY IF YOU DO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
ARE YOU MAD?
AND HOW DARE YOU INTERRUPT THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION?
- WHO IS THIS FOOLISH DANCER?
- DANCER?
I'M NO DANCER, YOUR EXCELLENCY.
LOOK, I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.
MAYBE I AM A DANCER.
IT WAS A MISTAKE, YOUR EXCELLENCY, I'VE NEVER DONE IT THAT GOOD BEFORE.
JULIO, WHO IS THIS PERSON?
HE CLAIMS TO BE A SECRET AGENT.
AND HE SAYS IF I DON'T EAT THE PEACH, OUR COUNTRY IS IN DANGER.
Emilio: OH, I AM SO SORRY SENOR AMBASSADOR.
HE IS PART OF MY TROUPE.
TWO DAYS AGO, YOU SEE, HE SUFFERED A VERY BAD NERVOUS BREAKDOWN AND THE BOY IS NOT YET HIMSELF.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM, DON'T WORRY.
- HERE, TAKE CARE OF THIS MAN AND TAKE HIM AWAY!
- BUT, YOUR EXCELLENCY!
BUT THEY'RE LYING, YOUR EXCELLENCY.
- TAKE HIM AWAY!
- NO, DON'T LET THEM TAKE HIM AWAY!
HE IS A SECRET AGENT.
HIS NUMBER IS 86, I'M NUMBER 99-- LISTEN, THIS POOR LITTLE GIRL, SHE'S HIS WIFE, YOU SEE.
IT'S BEEN SO MUCH FOR HER TO SEE HER HUSBAND CRUMBLE BEFORE HER VERY EYES.
- NO, MR.
PARKERSON!
- JULIO, TAKE AWAY THIS UNFORTUNATE PERSON.
DON HERNANDO, WITH YOUR PERMISSION I'D LIKE TO KEEP THEM HERE UNTIL I CHECK OUT THEIR STORY.
AS YOU WISH.
BUT THERE MUST BE ABSOLUTE SILENCE UNTIL THE FORMALITIES ARE OVER.
PLEASE!
FORGIVE ME, EMILIO, BUT WE CAN WAIT NO LONGER.
- I'M GOING TO SIGN THE PACT.
-Emilio: AS YOU WOULD WISH, YOUR EXCELLENCY.
I WOULD HOWEVER BE MUCH HONORED IF, WHEN YOU ARE SIGNING THE TREATY, YOU WOULD USE THE HUMBLE PEN OF EMILIO NAHARANA.
OF COURSE, IF IT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY.
- THAT'S IT!
THE IMMOBILO MUST BE IN THE PEN.
- YOU'RE RIGHT!
YOUR PEN SEEMS TO HAVE RUN OUT OF INK.
IT'S A BALLPOINT.
JUST PRESS DOWN THE LITTLE BUTTON-- YOUR EXCELLENCY, DON'T PRESS THAT BUTTON!
YOU'LL BE PARALYZED!
UH, THAT'S NONSENSE!
THIS MAN HAS TAKEN LEAVE OF HIS SENSES!
IF THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT PEN, EMILIO NAHARANA, THEN WHY DON'T YOU LET ME JAB YOU WITH IT?
- OH, THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
JULIO, TAKE HIM AWAY!
- WAIT!
EMILIO, IF THIS MAN IS AN IMPOSTER, WHY ARE YOU AFRAID TO TOUCH THE PEN, HUH?
UH, YOU WEAK, STUPID LITTLE FOOL, HOW DARE YOU MAKE TREATIES WITH THE DECADENT DEMOCRACIES!
I WAS ONLY GOING TO PARALYZE YOU.
NOW YOU DIE!
WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN?
WELL, IT ONLY GOES TO PROVE ONE THING, YOUR EXCELLENCY-- THE PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN THE SWORD.
SENOR SMART, MY GOVERNMENT IS IN YOUR DEBT.
THE SIGNING OF THE MUTUAL-AID PACT WOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED EXCEPT FOR YOUR EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY.
WELL, THANK YOU, AMBASSADOR, BUT BRAVERY IS MY BUSINESS.
THEREFORE IT IS MY GREAT PLEASURE TO AWARD YOU OUR COUNTRIES HIGHEST DECORATION.
THE LEGION OF HONOR.
- SMART, BRILLIANT.
- THANK YOU.
- MAXWELL, I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
THANK YOU, WINDISH.
MAX AND GET A POUND OF PEACHES.
OUR IMMUNITY IS JUST ABOUT-- UP.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
MAX, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
DON'T ACT SURPRISED.
OH NO, IT'S HER!
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
- IT'S TANYA.
THEY'VE GOT YOUR PICTURE PLASTERED ALL OVER THE EARLY MORNING PAPER.
OH, YOU SEE?
THAT'S YOUR GLORIOUS FREE PRESS YOU'RE ALWAYS BOASTING ABOUT.
WHERE IS YOUR MAXIMUM SECURITY NOW, MR.
SMART?
SHE'S RIGHT, MAX.
WE CANNOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT MISS LUPESCU IN A PUBLIC HOTEL.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF.
I'VE CHECKED THIS HOTEL A DOZEN TIMES.
I'M TELLING YOU IT'S ABSOLUTELY SAFE.
COME ON.
WE'D LIKE TO REGISTER, PLEASE.
DON'T MOVE.
HE HAS A GUN.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW, MR.
SMART?
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HE WON'T SHOOT, NOT AS LONG AS THE CASHIER WHO IS ONE OF OUR MEN HAS A GUN TRAINED ON HIS BACK.
I KNOW THAT, BUT THE BELLBOY HAS A GUN LEVELED AT THE CASHIER.
LOOK, IT'S ALL RIGHT BECAUSE AGENT 41 THE CHAMBERMAID HAS THE DROP ON THE BELLBOY.
AND SINCE I'VE NEVER TRUSTED THE CHAMBERMAID, AGENT 48 THE ELEVATOR OPERATOR HAS THE CHAMBERMAID COVERED.
IT'S A STANDOFF.
WHAT IS THAT?
EVERYBODY'S AFRAID TO SHOOT FOR FEAR HE HIMSELF WILL BE SHOT.
CONSEQUENTLY, NO ONE GETS HURT.
LET'S GET MISS LUPESCU OUT OF HERE.
-  -  -  -  OF COURSE, IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS ALL IT TAKES IS ONE WISE GUY.
THIS MEETING OF KAOS IS NOW IN SESSION.
ORDER OF BUSINESS-- THE LIQUIDATION OF TANYA LUPESCU.
SO FAR YOU HAVE FAILED MISERABLY.
SHE IS STILL ALIVE AND IN THE CUSTODY OF THE CONTROL ORGANIZATION.
IF SHE IS ALLOWED TO LIVE SHE WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IN COURT SEVERAL OF OUR TOP "EXECUTIVES".
SINCE YOU ARE ALL SUCH BUNGLERS I HAVE SENT FOR ONE OF OUR MOST TALENTED AGENTS TO PERFORM THE DELICATE TASK OF ELIMINATING MISS LUPESCU.
THAT MAN IS ALEXEI SEBASTIAN.
MAX, OUR EXPERIENCE THIS MORNING PROVES ONE THING-- IT'S JUST TOO DIFFICULT TO PROTECT MISS LUPESCU IN A PUBLIC HOTEL.
- IT TAKES TOO MANY AGENTS.
- YOU'RE RIGHT, CHIEF.
WE'VE GOT MORE MEN IN HOTELS THAN CONRAD HILTON.
I THINK I'VE GOT SOMETHING WORKED OUT.
SEE THIS LOCATION I HAVE MARKED OFF?
IT HAS FRONT, BACK AND SIDE EXITS FOR EXTREME MOBILITY.
A MINIMUM NUMBER OF AGENTS CAN BE PLANTED TO GIVE IT MAXIMUM SECURITY.
IT'S TWO MINUTES FROM THE COURTHOUSE AND IT'S GOT A COMMUNICATIONS SETUP - DIRECTLY TO CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.
- THAT'S PERFECT.
WHERE IS IT, CHIEF?
- IT'S YOUR APARTMENT.
- MY APARTMENT.
- MY APARTMENT?
!
- YES.
CHIEF, I CAN'T TAKE A GIRL TO MY APARTMENT.
WHAT WILL THE NEIGHBORS SAY?
THERE'S NO ALTERNATIVE, MAX.
BESIDES, IT'S SO OBVIOUS IT'S THE LAST PLACE KAOS WOULD THINK OF LOOKING.
BUT CHIEF, IT'S A BACHELOR APARTMENT.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE STOCKINGS ALL OVER THE SHOWER ROD AND CLOTHES ALL OVER THE FLOOR?
THIS IS AN ORDER, 86.
WELL, ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.
- BUT YOU'D BETTER GIVE ME AN HOUR OR SO.
- WHAT FOR?
WELL, I'VE GOT TO GET MY STOCKINGS OFF THE SHOWER ROD AND MY CLOTHES OFF THE FLOOR.
MAX, YOU'VE GOT TO GAIN TANYA LUPESCU'S CONFIDENCE.
FIRST OF ALL YOU'VE GOT TO IMPRESS HER WITH THE FACT THAT UNTIL SHE TESTIFIES, HER LIFE IS IN GREAT DANGER.
ALSO YOU'VE GOT TO FIND OUT ANYTHING ELSE SHE KNOWS ABOUT KAOS.
- NOW HERE'S OUR PROCEDURE-- - WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
ISN'T THIS TOP SECURITY?
YES.
WELL SHOULDN'T WE ACTIVATE THE CONE OF SILENCE?
MAX, I'VE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE MECHANICAL DIFFICULTY WITH IT LATELY, AND I-- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF.
THE WHOLE THING IS SO SIMPLE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS PRESS THIS BUTTON AND TURN THIS LEVER - ALL THE WAY TO THE RIGHT.
-  - NOW HERE'S OUR PLAN-- - HOLD IT, CHIEF.
OKAY, GO AHEAD.
ALL RIGHT.
FIRST, YOU TAKE TANYA TO YOUR APARTMENT.
MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT BEING FOLLOWED, EXCEPT, OF COURSE-- BY OUR OWN MEN.
MEANWHILE, I WILL TAKE 99, DISGUISED AS TANYA, TO A COMMERCIAL HOTEL.
WE'LL REGISTER 99 AND WE'LL SNEAK HER OUT OF THE HOTEL, MAKING SURE THAT SOME OF OUR MEN STAY BEHIND TO GUARD HER ROOM AS A DECOY.
HAVE YOU ANY QUESTIONS?
NO, CHIEF, I THINK THAT JUST ABOUT COVERS EVERYTHING.
ALL RIGHT, TANYA.
I THINK WE CAN RELAX NOW.
THIS APARTMENT IS PERFECTLY SAFE; IT'S UNDER MAXIMUM SECURITY.
WHO IS THAT?
I DON'T KNOW.
HOW DO YOU DO?
I'M YOUR MUTUAL INSURANCE AGENT.
OH, COME RIGHT IN.
WHO IS HE?
WELL, I'M NOT QUITE SURE YET.
AHA, JUST AS I THOUGHT.
HE'S MY MUTUAL INSURANCE AGENT.
ALL RIGHT, FELLA, COME ON, LET'S GO.
YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT A LOT OF CALLS TO MAKE.
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S OKAY.
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT INSURANCE.
WELL TANYA, WHY DON'T YOU JUST SIT DOWN AND RELAX FOR A WHILE?
THANK YOU.
NOW TANYA, I'M WONDERING, CAN YOU GIVE ME ANY INFORMATION THAT MIGHT HELP US IN TRYING TO PROTECT YOU?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
WHEN OUR MEN RESCUED YOU IN EUROPE AND BROUGHT YOU OVER HERE, HOW LONG WERE YOU A PRISONER OF KAOS?
ALMOST A WEEK.
NOW DURING THAT TIME, DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ABOUT THEIR METHOD OF OPERATION THAT MIGHT HELP US?
YES, THEY LEFT ME ALONE IN ONE OF THEIR OFFICES FOR AN HOUR ONE DAY.
I FOUND THEIR CODE BOOK AND WAS ABLE TO MEMORIZE THEIR CODING SYSTEM.
EH, DO YOU CONSIDER THAT IMPORTANT?
IMPORTANT?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
WHY, WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BREAK THEIR CODE FOR YEARS.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU STILL REMEMBER IT?
OF COURSE I DO.
THE FIRST VOWEL AFTER EVERY SECOND CONSONANT IS SUPERIMPOSED ON THE VOWEL IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING IT IN THE ALPHABET.
THE FIRST WORD AFTER EVERY PREPOSITION, IF IT IS NOT INTRODUCED BY AN ARTICLE OR A PERSONAL PRONOUN, IS INVERTED.
THE LETTER T STANDS FOR F EXCEPT AFTER E. Js COUNT FOR DOUBLE.
THE FIRST NUMBER AFTER EVERY SECOND ADVERB IS THE THIRD DIGIT AFTER A MODIFYING ADJECTIVE.
PROPER NAMES AND COUNTRIES EQUAL THE WORD "MARMALADE".
IS THAT IT?
IT'S SO SIMPLE.
NO WONDER WE WERE NEVER ABLE TO CRACK THAT CODE.
THAT'S THE WAY IT ALWAYS IS-- IT'S RIGHT THERE UNDER YOUR NOSE AND YOU NEVER SEE IT.
"MARMALADE".
OF COURSE.
AND FOR TWO YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON JELLY.
IF THAT'S ALL FOR NOW, MR.
SMART-- - UH, MAXWELL.
- MAXWELL-- I DO THINK I WOULD LIKE TO GET SOME REST.
OH, MOST CERTAINLY, TANYA, BUT ONE THING FIRST.
NOW I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU, BUT JUST IN CASE ANYBODY HAPPENS TO BREAK IN HERE I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU A FEW TRICKS IN SELF-DEFENSE.
- OH.
- NOW THE FIRST THING IS THIS-- A TELEPHONE?
WATCH VERY CAREFULLY.
YOU SEE THIS TRIGGER HERE?
YOU MERELY PRESS THIS AND THEN YOU DIAL 1-1-7.
THAT'S VERY INGENIOUS!
NOW I'M GOING TO ATTACK YOU.
WHAT?
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
JUST A LITTLE JUDO.
NOBODY WILL GET HURT.
EXCEPT ME.
WELL, I HOPE YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU DID, TANYA.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
OH, YES, OF COURSE.
WE'RE TRAINED TO TAKE FALLS.
YOU KNOW, MOST OF YOU AMERICANS ARE SO SOFT.
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU PUT SUCH UNNECESSARY EMPHASIS ON PHYSICAL COMFORT LIKE LUXURY OR LOVE.
LOVE?
YES, LOVE.
THAT'S ALL YOU SEEM TO TALK ABOUT-- ABOUT GLAMOUR, SEX APPEAL, ABOUT HUGGING AND KISSING.
WELL THAT'S NOT TRUE, TANYA.
I HARDLY EVER TALK ABOUT THOSE THINGS.
WHY, I HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT HUGGING OR KISSING IN WEEKS.
- MR.
SMART-- - MAXWELL.
- MAXWELL-- - MAX.
MAX, COULD YOU HONESTLY TELL ME THAT YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW?
THAT YOU WOULD NOT LIKE TO KISS ME?
WELL, UH-- WELL, LET'S DO IT AND GET IT OVER WITH.
I WILL SHOW YOU HOW LITTLE IT MEANS.
WELL, I THINK I'D LIKE TO UNPACK MY ROOM IF YOU'LL JUST SHOW ME TO MY BAG.
OH, MAX  OKAY, MAX, EVERYTHING'S GOING ACCORDING TO PLAN.
I'M GOING TO RELIEVE YOU NOW AND YOU ARE TO REPORT TO THE CHIEF IMMEDIATELY.
IT'S-- IT'S AN EMERGENCY.
OH, THIS.
WELL, IT'S REALLY NOTHING, 99.
I WAS JUST SHOWING TANYA A LITTLE JUDO.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY ROUGH.
I THINK SHE BROKE YOUR LIP.
THAT'LL BE ALL FOR NOW, K-13.
STAND BY FOR FURTHER ORDERS.
WHAT'S UP, CHIEF?
THANK YOU, FANG.
IT'S TROUBLE.
WE'VE JUST FOUND OUT WHERE THE THREAT TO TANYA LUPESCU'S LIFE WILL COME FROM.
ALEXEI SEBASTIAN, THE MASTER EXECUTIONER OF KAOS IS REPORTED IN THIS COUNTRY.
ALEXEI SEBASTIAN?
YES.
THE MAN HAS NEVER FAILED AN ASSIGNMENT.
NO MATTER HOW CLOSELY GUARDED A SUBJECT MAY BE, SEBASTIAN HAS ALWAYS MANAGED TO GET TO HIM THROUGH ONE OF HIS EXTRAORDINARY DISGUISES.
COME WITH ME.
I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES, MAX.
GEE, CHIEF, I HOPE IT'S NOT YOUR CUMBERLAND GAP TRIP AGAIN.
I JUST SAW THAT LAST WEEK.
NO, MAX.
Chief: DO YOU KNOW WHO THAT IS?
OF COURSE.
THAT'S SENATOR FARFAM.
WRONG.
THAT'S ALEXEI SEBASTIAN.
ISN'T THAT FRED GILES, THE TENNIS CHAMPION?
NO, SEBASTIAN AGAIN.
HMM, NICE FOREHAND.
MAX, SEBASTIAN IS SO DANGEROUS WE CONSIDER HIM TO BE A 101.
A 101?
- SHOOT ON RECOGNITION?
- RIGHT.
OH, I KNOW HIM.
THAT'S JOHNNY CARSON.
I WATCH HIS SHOW ALL THE TIME.
SEBASTIAN.
HE DID "THE TONIGHT SHOW" FOR TWO WEEKS BEFORE THEY FOUND OUT.
OH, NO, CHIEF.
NOT MY AUNT ROSE.
YES, IT'S HIM AGAIN.
GIVES YOU QUITE A SHOCK, DOESN'T IT?
NOT HALF AS MUCH OF A SHOCK AS IT'S GONNA GIVE HARRY.
- WHO'S HARRY?
- MY UNCLE.
WHICH ONE OF THEM IS SEBASTIAN?
WE STILL DON'T KNOW.
CHIEF, THAT MAN IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.
HOW ARE WE EVER GONNA TRAP HIM?
WELL, HE HAS ONE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTIC THAT HE CAN'T CONCEAL-- WEAK EYES.
WEAK EYES?
YES, WHEN EXPOSED TO BRIGHT LIGHTS HE BLINKS EXCESSIVELY.
BUT IF SEBASTIAN CAN BE ALL THOSE PEOPLE THEN HE CAN BE ANYBODY.
WHY, HE COULD BE ONE OF US.
GENTLEMEN, AS WE SUSPECTED, THEY HAVE TAKEN MISS LUPESCU TO MAXWELL SMART'S APARTMENT.
THE OTHER GIRL WAS JUST A DECOY.
NOW I HAVE THE PLEASURE OF INTRODUCING THE MAN WHO WILL BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THEIR DEFENSES AND KILL MISS LUPESCU.
GENTLEMEN, THE WORLD'S FOREMOST MASTER OF DISGUISE-- ALEXEI SEBASTIAN.
WELL, ANYWAY, CHIEF, I THINK WE SHOULD STRENGTHEN OUR SECURITY MEASURES.
ABSOLUTELY.
BUT WE'LL NEED A COUNTERSIGN SO THAT WHEN I COME TO YOUR APARTMENT LATER TO QUESTION TANYA WE'LL KNOW WE'RE NOT SPEAKING TO IMPOSTORS.
JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE, CHIEF, WHY DON'T WE USE A DOUBLE COUNTERSIGN?
GOOD IDEA.
OH, HERE'S A GOOD ONE-- I'LL SAY, "THE MIGRATING BIRDS FLY LOW OVER THE SEA".
YOU SAY, "SHADELESS WINDOWS ADMIT NO LIGHT".
THEN I'LL SAY, "THE WINGLESS DOVE PROTECTS HIS NEST".
AND YOU SAY, "THE TOOTHLESS TIGER RULES A RESTLESS JUNGLE".
- HAVE YOU GOT THAT?
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY IT.
THE MIGRATING BIRDS FLY LOW OVER THE SEA.
THE RESTLESS JUNGLE ADMITS NO SHADES.
NO, MAX, I HAVE THE RESTLESS JUNGLE.
YOU HAVE THE SHADELESS WINDOWS AND THE WINGLESS DOVES.
OH.
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THE THE WINGLESS DOVES AND I HAD THE SHADELESS NO, MAX.
HOW ABOUT THIS FOR A DOUBLE COUNTERSIGN, CHIEF?
YOU SAY, "HELLO, MAX," AND I SAY, "HI, CHIEF," - AND YOU SAY-- - SMART!
IT'S ON THIS CARD.
MEMORIZE IT.
AND REMEMBER, ALEXEI SEBASTIAN CAN IMPERSONATE ANYONE.
- ANYONE?
- ANYONE.
THE ONLY TWO WE'RE SURE OF ARE YOU AND ME.
THERE ARE THREE OF US IN THIS ROOM, CHIEF.
- YOU MEAN--?
- YES.
F-A-N-G.
MAX, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH SEBASTIAN.
LET'S PUT HIM TO A LITTLE TEST.
THAT'S FANG ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.
NO OTHER SECRET AGENT IN THE WORLD CAN RUN THAT FAST.
Max: 99, WE'VE GOT TO BE EXTRA CAREFUL.
ALEXEI SEBASTIAN THE MASTER IMPERSONATOR HAS BEEN HIRED BY KAOS TO GET TANYA.
THE MAN IS INCREDIBLE.
WHY, HE COULD BE IMPERSONATING ANYBODY.
RIGHT.
CHIEF CALLED JUST AFTER YOU LEFT TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS ALL RIGHT.
HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS THE CHIEF?
HE GAVE ME THE DOUBLE COUNTERSIGN.
OH.
WHAT WAS IT?
"MIGRATING BIRDS FLY LOW OVER THE SEA".
"SHADELESS WINDOWS ADMIT NO LIGHT".
"THE WINGLESS DOVE PROTECTS HIS NEST".
AND "THE TIGER RULES THE RESTLESS JUNGLE".
WRONG.
THE TOOTHLESS TIGER.
OH, MAXIE, I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU COME IN.
I WILL BE RIGHT DOWN AFTER I TAKE MY SHOWER.
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND MY BORROWING YOUR TOWEL.
WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, TANYA, THAT'S MY FAVORITE TOWEL.
YOU CAN USE IT FOR A WHILE.
WELL, GOOD NIGHT, 99.
OH, I'M STAYING, MAX.
WE CAN TAKE TURNS WATCHING.
THERE'S REALLY NO NEED FOR THAT, 99.
I THINK I CAN HANDLE THE SITUATION.
I'M GOING TO MAKE SOME COFFEE.
IT'S GOING TO BE A LONG NIGHT.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAX.
I CAN MAKE THE COFFEE.
YOU SEEM TO FORGET THAT I'M A WOMAN TOO.
BESIDES, REMEMBER THE COFFEE I MADE FOR YOU LAST WEEK?
HOW ABOUT SOME TEA?
I'LL MAKE THE COFFEE, 99.
THE MIGRATING BIRDS FLY LOW OVER THE SEA.
SHADELESS WINDOWS ADMIT NO LIGHT.
THE WINGLESS DOVE PROTECTS HIS NEST.
THE TOOTHLESS TIGER RULES THE RESTLESS JUNGLE.
CHIEF, IS IT REALLY YOU?
OF COURSE IT'S ME, 99.
COME ON IN.
I GUESS YOU WANT TO INTERROGATE OUR GAY DEFECTOR.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
- COME ON.
SHE'S UPSTAIRS.
-  - 99, WHY DON'T YOU ANSWER THE-- OH, HI, CHIEF.
COME ON IN.
I GUESS YOU'RE HERE TO QUESTION THE GIRL.
THAT'S RIGHT, MAX.
UH, CHIEF YOU FORGOT THE COUNTERSIGN.
THE OLD COUNTERSIGN OR THE NEW COUNTERSIGN?
NEW COUNTERSIGN?
YES, I SAY, "APPLES," YOU SAY, "MACINTOSH".
OH.
CHIEF THE COUNTERSIGN.
- APPLES.
- MACINTOSH.
THE GIRL'S UPSTAIRS, CHIEF.
MAX, WOULD YOU FIX ME A DRINK?
OH SURE, CHIEF.
COME ON OVER TO THE BAR, PICK OUT ANYTHING YOU LIKE.
HOW ABOUT SOME BOURBON?
THAT'S FINE.
TANYA, THE CHIEF WANTS TO TALK TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU'RE DRESSED.
I WILL BE OUT IN A FEW MINUTES.
- IT'S BEEN A TRYING DAY, 99.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHIEF?
- IS YOUR ULCER ACTING UP AGAIN?
- YES, I'M AFRAID SO.
I WONDER IF I COULD TROUBLE YOU FOR A GLASS OF BUTTERMILK.
- THAT USUALLY HELPS.
- OF COURSE, CHIEF.
THANK YOU.
- HOW ABOUT THIS, CHIEF?
- FINE.
FIX IT FOR ME.
OH, CHIEF, I JUST BROKE A NAIL.
COULD YOU HELP ME GET THE TOP OFF THE BUTTERMILK, PLEASE?
OH, CHIEF MAX.
HERE'S YOUR DRINK.
OH, THANK YOU.
THAT'S NOT BUTTERMILK.
YOU BET YOUR SWEET LIFE IT ISN'T.
I WANTED-- MAX, DID YOU LEAVE THIS DOOR OPEN?
I DON'T THINK SO, CHIEF.
I'D BETTER CHECK THE CORRIDOR.
NO, I'LL CHECK THE CORRIDOR.
OH, MAXIE YES TANYA, WHAT IS IT?
DO YOU HAVE A BATHROBE?
I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.
I'LL LOOK FOR ONE ANYWAY.
NOW DRINK IT ALL DOWN, CHIEF.
IT'LL MAKE YOU FEEL MUCH BETTER.
LOOK, SOMEONE LEFT THE DOOR OPEN.
THERE.
WELL, I THINK TANYA SHOULD BE OUT OF THE SHOWER BY NOW.
I DON'T THINK I'LL NEED YOU.
I CAN QUESTION TANYA MYSELF.
CHIEF, YOU KNOW CONTROL'S RULE ON INTERROGATION-- NEVER INTERROGATE A FEMALE SUSPECT WITHOUT ANOTHER AGENT PRESENT.
- WHO MADE THAT RULE?
- YOUR WIFE.
YES.
THIS BUTTERMILK HAS LEFT A BITTER TASTE IN MY MOUTH.
POUR ME A LITTLE BOURBON, WILL YOU?
- BOURBON, CHIEF?
- BOURBON!
RIGHT, CHIEF.
CHIEF, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT THERE?
CHECKING THE CORRIDOR.
BUT SOMEBODY LOCKED ME OUTSIDE.
OH, CHIEF.
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY TO RELAX.
I JUST DON'T THINK MY ULCER IS GOING TO SURVIVE THIS NIGHT.
HERE, LET ME HAVE THAT BUTTERMILK.
BUT CHIEF, THAT'S--  BOURBON AGAIN?
DOES "BOURBON" SOUND LIKE "BUTTERMILK"?
GET ME SOME BUTTERMILK!
RIGHT, CHIEF.
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK SHE'LL BE?
I'LL CHECK IT OUT, CHIEF.
- TANYA -  YES, MAXIE?
Max: HOW LONG WILL YOU BE, DEAR?
Tanya: FIVE MINUTES.
- HOW LONG WILL SHE BE?
- ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, CHIEF.
TELL HER TO HURRY UP.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
TANYA?
YES, MAXIE?
HOW LONG WILL YOU BE NOW?
FOUR MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS.
Max: DO YOU HAVE ENOUGH TOWELS?
- Tanya: YES.
- Max: OH.
WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO DO TO GET A GLASS OF BUTTERMILK?
THANK YOU, 99.
SHE'LL JUST BE A MINUTE, CHIEF.
GET ME A DRINK, WILL YOU, MAX?
RIGHT, CHIEF.
OH, THANKS, CHIEF.
HERE YOU ARE, CHIEF.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT.
DON'T ANYBODY MOVE.
KILL HIM.
HE'S ALEXEI SEBASTIAN.
KILL HIM, MAX.
HE'S AN IMPOSTOR.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON AROUND HERE.
WELL SO ENDS THE CAREER OF ALEXEI SEBASTIAN-- AN UGLY CUSTOMER IF I EVER SAW ONE.
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
WHAT ON EARTH HAPPENED?
ALEXEI SEBASTIAN HAS JUST PLAYED HIS LAST ROLE.
BUT MAX, HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WAS THE IMPOSTOR?
WELL, IT WAS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE, CHIEF.
YOU SEE, I REMEMBERED THAT SEBASTIAN HAD WEAK EYES.
SO I MERELY TOOK THIS LAMP AND FLASHED IT IN HIS EYES.
UH-OH.
I MAY HAVE MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
IF THIS IS THE REAL CHIEF, YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE, FELLA.
WELL, WITH SEBASTIAN OUT OF THE WAY I THINK WE CAN ALL GET A GOOD NIGHT'S REST.
HE OUGHT TO GET A LONG PRISON TERM FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER.
YES, I THINK WE'VE GOT HIM THIS TIME.
THE TROUBLE BEFORE HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH WITNESSES.
SINCE NOBODY KNEW WHAT HE REALLY LOOKS LIKE NOBODY WAS ABLE TO POSITIVELY IDENTIFY HIM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
IF WE WERE ASKED TO IDENTIFY HIM, WE WOULD SAY HE LOOKED LIKE OUR CHIEF.
ON THE OTHER HAND THEY COULD SAY OUR CHIEF LOOKED LIKE A FIENDISH INTERNATIONAL KILLER.
SMART WELL THERE ARE TWO WAYS OF LOOKING AT IT, CHIEF.
WELL, LIKE THE CHIEF SAYS, I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GET A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.
BY THE WAY, WHERE'S MISS LUPESCU?
UH, WELL, SHE WENT UP TO BED ALREADY.
SHE HAS TO BE UP EARLY IN THE MORNING FOR THE TRIAL.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING TO SLEEP?
I'LL JUST BUNK OUT HERE ON THE COUCH SOMEPLACE, CHIEF.
I THINK SOMEONE SHOULD BE HERE ALL THE TIME TO SEE THAT TANYA IS SAFE.
OH, I DON'T MIND STAYING, MAX.
UH, NO NO, THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT, 99.
WELL, CALL US A CAB THEN, MAX, WILL YOU?
- HMM?
- CALL US A CAB.
OH, RIGHT, CHIEF.
AND BE SURE AND GET TO BED EARLY.
YOU LOOK A LITTLE TIRED.
YES WELL, I DO FEEL A LITTLE TIRED, CHIEF, BUT I'LL JUST SLIP INTO MY PAJAMAS AND GET SOME SLEEP.
GOOD NIGHT, MAXIE.
-  -  I THINK 99 OUGHTA STAY HERE TONIGHT, 86.
YOU COME ON HOME WITH ME.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MAX.
GOOD NIGHT, MAXIE.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
SORRY, SIR, BUT THAT ONLY COMES IN BROWN.
OH.
WELL, I THINK THESE WILL BE FINE.
UH, ONE OF THEM IS A LITTLE TIGHT.
- THE LEFT ONE.
- YES.
- IN THE BACK.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
YOU FORGOT TO REMOVE THE SHOEHORN.
HOW DO THEY FEEL NOW?
A LITTLE LOOSE.
I THINK I'D BETTER PUT THAT BACK.
SIR, YOU'VE BEEN IN HERE OVER AN HOUR NOW.
AN HOUR?
THAT'S FUNNY.
IT SEEMS LIKE ONLY ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
YOU MUST BE GOOD COMPANY.
YOU'VE TRIED ON JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING IN THE STORE.
WHAT'S THAT IN THE BOX OVER THERE ON THE COUNTER?
MY LUNCH.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO TRY THAT ON?
SIR, LOOK WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK NEXT WEEK?
WE'RE GETTING A WHOLE NEW SHIPMENT IN THEN.
NO, I THINK THESE WILL BE FINE.
I'LL WEAR THEM HOME.
JUST TAKE MY OLD SHOES AND PUT THEM IN A BOX.
WHAT'S KEEPING YOU?
I NEED YOUR HELP WITH THIS CODE.
THAT FOOL OUT THERE--S I'VE TRIED EVERYTHING TO GET RID OF HIM.
WELL, HURRY.
KAOS IS PAYING US TO SMUGGLE INFORMATION, NOT SELL SHOES.
YOUR BOX IS RINGING.
IT'S THE SHOE.
- A TELEPHONE.
- DON'T ANSWER IT.
BUT ALL DAY LONG I'LL WONDER WHO CALLED.
THERE'S ONLY ONE MAN I KNOW OF WHO HAS A TELEPHONE CONCEALED IN HIS SHOE.
THAT'S A CONTROL AGENT BY THE NAME OF MAXWELL SMART.
YOU MEAN THAT'S SMART OUT THERE?
- THINK HE'S WISE TO US?
- WHY ELSE IS HE HERE?
THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM.
THEY ONLY COME IN BROWN.
WELL LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU MEET ME AT MY APARTMENT, AND WE'LL GO TO DINNER AND THE CONCERT FROM THERE?
GOOD, OH AND 99, TELL THE CHIEF I'M STILL LOOKING FOR THE SPY RING.
NO, NOTHING YET.
I JUST HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE.
RIGHT.
SEE YOU LATER.
HE MUST KNOW THIS IS OUR HEADQUARTERS, UNLESS IT'S JUST A CRAZY COINCIDENCE.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.
HERE'S YOUR OLD PAIR, SIR.
- OH, THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.
AND PLEASE, CALL AGAIN.
COULDN'T GET HIM.
CUSTOMER.
ALL RIGHT, LET ME HAVE IT.
NOW YOU STAY HERE AND DON'T WORRY.
I'LL GET SMART.
HI, CHIEF.
MAX, WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?
SOME GUY TRIED TO RUN ME DOWN IN A CAR.
LUCKILY, I JUMPED ASIDE JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME, - AND LEAPED FOR HIS RUNNING BOARD.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
THEY DON'T MAKE RUNNING BOARDS ANYMORE.
MAX, WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT ABOUT KAOS'S HEADQUARTERS?
ISN'T THAT TOP SECURITY INFORMATION, CHIEF?
YES, MAX.
YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT OUT HERE IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS?
I DEMAND THE CONE OF SILENCE.
MAX, DO WE HAVE TO?
WELL, WITH VITAL INFORMATION LIKE THIS, OF COURSE WE HAVE TO, CHIEF.
OKAY, YOU WIN, MAX.
HODGKINS, LOWER THE CONE OF SILENCE.
- NOW WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT?
- NOTHING.
HODGKINS, RAISE THE CONE OF SILENCE.
IF YOU HAD NOTHING TO REPORT, WHY DID YOU INSIST ON LOWERING THAT?
WELL, CHIEF, RULE 13 SAYS THAT IF YOU HAVE-- MAX, WHY DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO LIVE BY THE RULES?
BECAUSE RULE 27 SAYS THAT YOU MUST ALWAYS LIVE BY THE RULES OF THE BOOK.
ALL RIGHT, NEVER MIND.
SOMEDAY I'LL LEARN.
IT'S ALL RIGHT THERE IN THE BOOK, CHIEF.
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS LOOK.
- MAX.
DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T MADE PROGRESS ON THIS CASE.
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT DAY AND NIGHT.
AND I'VE CHECKED OUT EVERY SINGLE - SUSPICIOUS CHARACTER IN THIS CITY.
- AND?
I HAVE EVERYTHING, ALL THE INFORMATION, RIGHT HERE IN MY DIAL-A-FACT.
- YOUR WHAT?
- MY DIAL-A-FACT, CHIEF.
IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING THAT I BUILT IN THE LAB.
IT'S A GREAT THING FOR SECRET AGENTS - WHO ARE TIRED AND ON THE GO.
- HOW DOES IT WORK?
IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE, CHIEF.
YOU SEE, I JUST DIAL A LETTER FOR THE INFORMATION I WANT.
FOR EXAMPLE, I DIAL "A".
THERE WE ARE, RIGHT AT MY FINGERTIPS.
NOW "A" IS FOR ASSASSINS.
THIS LISTS ALL THE KAOS ASSASSINS KNOWN ALL OVER THE WORLD.
IT'S VERY INGENIOUS, MAX.
NOW, LET'S TRY "B".
THERE WE ARE.
"B" IS FOR BIRTHDAYS.
THIS LISTS THE BIRTHDAYS OF SECRET AGENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
AND THE BIRTHDAY PRESENTS I SENT THEM.
THAT'S AMAZING, MAX.
YES,"C" IS FOR CODES, AND "D" IS FOR SECRET-LETTER DROPS AND SO FORTH.
MARVELOUS.
WHAT DOES "E" STAND FOR?
EVERYTHING.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, CHIEF?
IT'S JUST A SLIGHT HEADACHE, MAX.
OH, ANOTHER ONE OF THOSE, HUH?
I HAVE JUST THE THING FOR IT.
"H" FOR HEADACHES.
NO, MAX.
NEVER MIND.
JUST SIT DOWN.
AS YOU KNOW, MAX, CONTROL KEEPS A TIGHT SECURITY REIN ON THE FRIENDS AND RELATIVES OF ALL OUR AGENTS.
NOW WE'VE RECEIVED A REPORT THAT YOUR AUNT BERTHA AND UNCLE ABNER ARE COMING TO TOWN TO SURPRISE YOU.
OH, THAT WILL BE A SURPRISE.
IF THEY FIND OUT THAT YOU ARE A CONTROL AGENT AND SPREAD THE WORD, YOU WILL BE OF ABSOLUTELY NO VALUE TO US ANY LONGER.
- CHIEF-- - I JUST WANT TO IMPRESS UPON YOU THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING YOUR OCCUPATION A SECRET FROM YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT.
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT'S THE WAY IT HAS TO BE UNTIL THEY LEAVE TOWN.
- NOW WHAT'S YOUR COVER STORY?
- WHICH ONE?
THE ONE YOU GAVE YOUR UNCLE AND AUNT.
WHAT DID YOU TELL THEM YOU WERE DOING FOR A LIVING?
OH MY GOSH, CHIEF.
I DON'T REMEMBER.
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?
WHAT ABOUT THE FILES, CHIEF?
DON'T WE KEEP A FULL RECORD OF ALL THE COVER STORIES?
RIGHT.
JUST LET ME GET MY COPY OF THE COVER FILE.
MAX, DO YOU HAVE A MATCH TO MELT THIS SEAL WITH?
- SURE.
I'LL DO IT FOR YOU, CHIEF.
- THANK YOU.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE, CHIEF.
THAT'S RIGHT.
THOSE PAPERS WERE LOST IN THAT FIRE WE HAD - IN THE FILING ROOM LAST YEAR.
- YES, I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT FIRE.
WE NEVER DID FIND OUT HOW THAT WAS STARTED.
NO WE DIDN'T.
WE SUSPECTED IT WAS SABOTAGE.
I'LL GET IT, CHIEF.
IT WAS PROBABLY KAOS, CHIEF.
THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN JEALOUS OF OUR NEAT FILING SYSTEM.
THESE THINGS CERTAINLY DO GET STARTED MYSTERIOUSLY, DON'T THEY?
NOT TOO MYSTERIOUSLY.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MY COVER STORY, CHIEF.
A LITTLE CLEVER QUESTIONING OF UNCLE ABNER AND I'LL GET ALL THE INFORMATION I NEED.
WHAT COUNTEROFFENSIVE DEVICES DO YOU HAVE IN YOUR APARTMENT, MAX?
WELL, LET'S SEE NOW ROLL-UP RUG, CARGO NET, - DESK DRAWER - WHAT'S THAT?
OH, YOU KNOW THE DESK DRAWER, CHIEF.
PRESS THE BUTTON ON THE LAMP, AND THE DRAWER COMES OUT AND HITS YOU IN THE STOMACH.
OH YES.
WHAT ELSE?
- UH, SELTZER BOTTLE.
- BEFORE YOUR AUNT AND UNCLE ARRIVE, BE SURE YOU DEACTIVATE THEM SO AS NOT TO AROUSE THEIR SUSPICION.
HERE ARE SOME LEADS ON KAOS HEADQUARTERS THAT I GOT FROM 99.
- BE SURE AND MEMORIZE THEM AND DESTROY THEM.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
MAX I'M BEING CAREFUL, CHIEF.
MAX!
I'LL GET IT, CHIEF.
ONE OF THESE DAYS I'VE GOT TO GET THAT CLOSET CLEANED OUT.
OKAY, NOW IT'S MY TURN.
ON SECOND THOUGHT I THINK I'LL SKIP MY TURN.
SMART, KAOS WANTS YOU DESTROYED.
OOF.
WHO IS IT?
Woman: SURPRISE AUNT BERTHA.
Man: AND UNCLE ABNER.
UH, I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A MINUTE, AS SOON AS I GET OUT OF THE RUG.
- Bertha: THE WHAT?
- EH, THE TUB.
Bertha: BE SURE TO DRY YOUR HAIR.
HOLD IT.
ALL RIGHT.
SIT DOWN.
DOWN.
I'M GOING TO HAVE THIS GUN IN MY POCKET AT ALL TIMES, SO YOU'LL BE COMPLETELY COVERED.
AS FAR AS MY AUNT AND UNCLE ARE CONCERNED, YOU AND I ARE OLD ARMY BUDDIES.
HAVE YOU GOT THAT?
YEAH, WE FLEW TOGETHER IN THE LUFTWAFFE.
RIGHT.
NO, THAT'S THE WRONG SIDE.
AUNT BERTHA, UNCLE ABNER, WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU HE'D BE SURPRISED?
UH, WHAT BRINGS YOU TO TOWN?
WHAT BRINGS US TO TOWN?
TELL HIM, ABNER.
NICE PLACE YOU'VE GOT HERE, MAX.
WHO'S THAT, A FRIEND OF YOURS?
EH, YES, THIS IS ONE OF MY OLD ARMY BUDDIES, UNCLE ABNER, ONE OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS, - IRVING.
- VICTOR.
- VICTOR IRVING.
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HOW WAS YOUR TRIP?
- OUR TRIP?
OH, TELL HIM, ABNER.
GOOD-LOOKING DESK YOU'VE GOT HERE, MAX.
HOW DO YOU TURN ON THE LAMP?
UH, JUST PRESS THAT BUTTON.
OH.
DON'T PRESS THAT BUTTON.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH PRESSING A LITTLE BUTTON?
WHAT WAS THAT?
JUST A LITTLE DEVICE FOR BUSY EXECUTIVES.
IT HARDENS THE STOMACH MUSCLES.
WHAT WON'T THEY THINK OF NEXT?
ANYBODY WANT A DRINK?
WHAT'S THAT FOR?
THE HEAD MUSCLES?
WHAT DO YOU DO FOR A LIVING NOW, MAXWELL?
I THINK HE DESIGNS AMUSEMENT PARKS.
WHAT DO YOU DO, MAX?
OH, UH, SAME OLD THING.
OF COURSE, I WAS PROMOTED SINCE I SAW YOU LAST.
PROMOTED TO WHAT?
EH, WHAT WAS I BEFORE?
- BEFORE WHAT?
- BEFORE I WAS PROMOTED.
YOU WEREN'T THE PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY.
WELL, I'M NOT THE VICE PRESIDENT.
I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND.
IT'S A COMPLICATED BUSINESS.
- VERY MUCH LIKE YOURS, WOULDN'T YOU SAY?
- VERY.
EH, WHAT IS YOUR BUSINESS, UNCLE ABNER?
I'M RETIRED.
I SUPPOSE YOU PEOPLE ARE VERY TIRED AND WANT TO UNPACK.
- WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?
- WE DON'T KNOW YET.
OH, MAX WOULDN'T PERMIT YOU TO STAY ANYPLACE BUT HERE.
HE'D BE VERY INSULTED.
THANK YOU, MAXWELL.
DIDN'T I TELL YOU, ABNER?
SOMEBODY'S AT THE DOOR.
I'LL ANSWER IT.
- DON'T ANYBODY MOVE.
- WHY NOT?
EH, IT'S JUST THAT YOU MAKE SUCH A NICE FAMILY PICTURE.
- HELLO, MAX.
- SHH.
I'VE GOT A KAOS SPY ON MY HANDS.
MY AUNT AND UNCLE ARE HERE AND I'VE GOT TO COVER MY IDENTITY.
I'LL WAIT OUT HERE.
YOU LET HIM OUT AND I'LL ARREST HIM.
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT.
- WHO WAS THAT, MAXWELL?
- JUST THE MAID, AUNT BERTHA.
I TOLD HER I WOULDN'T NEED HER TODAY.
THE PLACE IS A MESS.
I'LL CALL HER BACK.
AUNT BERTHA, WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.
OHH.
YOU'RE THE MAID?
UH, THE MAID?
YES, I'M THE MAID.
I WAS JUST DUSTING THE CRACK UNDER THE DOOR.
BOY, WHAT YOU MUST GET AN HOUR.
YOU SEE, I WAS JUST ON MY WAY TO A PARTY, AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY AND ASK MR.
SMART IF I COULD SKIP HIS APARTMENT TODAY.
THAT'S RIGHT, AUNT BERTHA, AND I TOLD HER IT WAS OKAY.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MY FRIEND VICTOR ALONG WITH YOU?
- GOOD IDEA!
- NO NO, I CAN'T GO.
- WHAT WOULD MY WIFE SAY?
- SHE CAN COME WITH US.
- SHE'S IN THE HOSPITAL HAVING A BABY.
- TAKE THEM BOTH ALONG.
Bertha: THERE WILL BE NO PARTIES.
IF YOU'RE PAID TO CLEAN, YOU'LL CLEAN.
OH, I CAN'T DO THAT.
- YOU CAN'T?
- NO.
I'M GOING TO GO RIGHT DOWN TO THE MANAGER AND HAVE YOU FIRED.
NOW YOU WOULDN'T DO THAT?
UH, YES, I'M AFRAID SHE WOULD.
UH, IT'S ALL RIGHT, I'M SURE SHE'D BE GLAD TO CLEAN.
WE'VE GOT TO STALL - TILL WE GET VICTOR OUT OF HERE.
- ALL RIGHT.
MAXWELL, WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR CLEANING THINGS?
UH, UPSTAIRS IN THE UTILITY ROOM, AUNT BERTHA.
COME ALONG, HERE.
THE VERY IDEA OF THINKING ABOUT GOING TO A PARTY UNTIL YOU'VE FINISHED YOUR CLEANING.
YOU'LL NOT LEAVE THIS APARTMENT UNTIL IT'S SPICK-AND-SPAN.
EXCUSE ME, I'M GOING IN THE KITCHEN AND GET A GLASS OF WATER.
I'LL GO WITH YOU.
I'M A LITTLE THIRSTY MYSELF.
NO, STAY HERE AND CHAT WITH YOUR UNCLE.
I'LL BRING YOU A GLASS OF WATER.
NO, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF WATER I LIKE.
I MEAN, YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FAUCET IS.
IN MOST APARTMENTS IT'S OVER THE SINK.
AROUND HERE I WOULDN'T BET ON IT.
I'LL STAY AND CHAT WITH YOUR UNCLE.
YOU BRING ME A GLASS OF WATER.
I PROPOSE WE BOTH GO TO THE KITCHEN.
THERE'S SOMETHING I'D LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.
EXCUSE US, UNCLE ABNER.
COME ON, COME ON, HURRY UP.
WE'VE GOT LOTS TO DO.
FIRST WE'LL START WITH THE WINDOW RIGHT OVER HERE.
AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO DO THE FLOORS.
NOW THE ONLY WAY TO DO THE FLOORS IS ON YOUR HANDS AND KNEES.
ALL RIGHT, PUT DOWN THE BUCKET.
COME ON, SIT DOWN HERE.
THAT'S IT.
NOW THIS IS THE ONLY WAY TO DO THE WINDOWS.
BERTHA, COME HERE A MINUTE.
THIS IS CERTAINLY A PECULIAR APARTMENT.
YES, AND MAXWELL'S ACTING VERY STRANGELY.
DID YOU NOTICE HE NEVER TAKES HIS HAND OUT OF HIS POCKET?
I WONDER IF HE HURT HIMSELF.
POOR THING UH, UNCLE ABNER, WHY DON'T YOU AND AUNT BERTHA TAKE YOUR THINGS AND GO ON UPSTAIRS?
WHY NOT?
WE'VE BEEN ON ALL THE RIDES DOWN HERE.
MAX, SHALL I TAKE HIM IN?
GOOD IDEA, 99.
AUNT BERTHA, THE MAID'S THROUGH WITH THE WINDOW.
- NO.
- GOOD.
YOU'VE FINISHED.
- LISTEN, I'VE REALLY-- - UPSTAIRS NEXT.
ALL RIGHT, VICTOR, LET'S GO, MOVE OUT, COME ON.
I'M CALLING CONTROL AND HAVING YOU TAKEN IN, SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL ME WHERE YOUR HEADQUARTERS IS RIGHT NOW.
OH, SO YOU DON'T KNOW.
MAX, CAN I MOVE YOUR CLOTHES FROM ONE SIDE OF THE CLOSET TO THE OTHER?
GO RIGHT AHEAD, UNCLE ABNER.
THANK YOU.
EH, UNCLE ABNER, AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ABOUT THIS?
ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT.
ALL RIGHT, VICTOR.
YOU AND I ARE GOING DOWNTOWN.
GET YOUR HANDS UP AND DON'T MOVE.
THE LITTLE GAME IS OVER.
Bertha: DON'T YOU ARGUE WITH ME.
THE GAME IS ON AGAIN.
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN AND DON'T MOVE.
FIRST YOU'LL MOP THE FLOOR.
THEN I WANT TWO COATS OF WAX.
- NO!
- WHAT?
UH, ONE COAT OF WAX WILL BE FINE, AUNT BERTHA.
MAXWELL, WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR TOWELS?
UPSTAIRS IN THE LINEN CLOSET, AUNT BERTHA.
- OH, WHAT'S THIS?
- UH-- - OOH.
- BYE,EVERYBODY.
MAX, YOUR SHOE IS RINGING.
TAKE A MESSAGE, UNCLE ABNER.
- SOMETHING TERRIBLE IS HAPPENING.
-  I KNOW.
HE MUST BE MIXED UP IN SOMETHING BAD.
- HE'S EITHER A BOOKMAKER OR A GAMBLER.
- OR A MUSICIAN.
- WE'D BETTER FOLLOW HIM.
- OH, DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD?
WE OWE IT TO THE FAMILY, AFTER ALL, HE IS YOUR SISTER'S SON.
MY SISTER'S SON?
I THOUGHT HE WAS YOUR SISTER'S SON.
I DON'T THINK SO.
I HOPE NOT.
I DON'T CARE ABOUT AUNT BERTHA AND UNCLE ABNER.
ALL I KNOW IS THAT KAOS IS NOT GOING TO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU BUNGLED THE OPPORTUNITY TO KILL SMART.
SMART POSES NO THREAT TO US.
HE'S SO BUSY COVERING UP FROM HIS AUNT AND UNCLE HE DOESN'T HAVE TIME TO FIND OUR HEADQUARTERS.
- MAXWELL.
- AUNT BERTHA, UNCLE ABNER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US YOU WORKED IN A SHOE STORE?
EH, I THOUGHT YOU KNEW.
NOW I'M HERE, I MIGHT AS WELL GET A PAIR OF SHOES.
I KNOW A GREAT SHOE STORE.
COME ON.
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH THIS ONE?
- WE CAN'T FIT YOU HERE.
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW HIS SIZE.
EXACTLY WHY WE CAN'T FIT YOU.
COME ON.
MAX, DO YOU MEAN YOU DON'T WANT TO WAIT ON ME?
PLEASE BE SEATED.
NOW EXACTLY WHAT DID YOU HAVE IN MIND?
BLACK OXFORD, BLACK OXFORD, I'LL SEE IF WE HAVE ANY.
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
HE REALLY WORKS HERE.
YES, AND IT'S A VERY NICE STORE.
IT CERTAINLY IS.
WHY ARE WE WHISPERING?
WHAT'S WRONG?
NOTHING.
WHY?
OKAY, HERE IT IS.
LET'S GO.
DON'T I GET A CHANCE TO TRY IT ON?
I TRIED IT ON.
IT FITS PERFECTLY.
- DOESN'T HE GET TWO SHOES?
- TWO SHOES?
YES, HE HATES TO HOP.
IS THAT YOU, HERMAN?
- THAT'S FUNNY.
- WHAT IS IT?
THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE GOING ON HERE.
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED.
COME ON.
VICTOR.
UH, AUNT BERTHA, UNCLE ABNER.
WE DIDN'T KNOW YOU WORKED IN THIS STORE TOO.
TOO?
YES, MAXWELL NEVER TOLD US THAT YOU BOTH - WORKED IN THE SAME STORE.
- WHERE IS MAX?
HE'S IN THE BACKROOM GETTING ME MY OTHER-- HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX, LISTEN-- ALL RIGHT, SMART.
EXCUSE ME, CHIEF.
I'LL HAVE TO CALL YOU BACK LATER.
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE.
LET'S SEE, THAT WAS 9C WASN'T IT?
THEY MUST HAVE A BIG CALL FOR 9C.
- 9C.
- Abner: MAX IF IT WILL MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR YOU, I'LL TAKE AN 8D.
RIGHT.
HELLO, CHIEF?
THIS IS MAX.
THEIR HEADQUARTERS IS IN LARSEN'S SHOE STORE.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
THE INFORMATION WAS WRITTEN IN CODE ON THE INSIDE OF THE SHOES.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, WHEN MY UNCLE ABNER LEAVES THE STORE, HE WILL BE WEARING THE PLANS OF A DEADLY SEA-TO-AIR MISSILE.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
SORRY ABOUT THIS, FELLAS.
HERE YOU ARE, UNCLE ABNER.
BLACK OXFORDS.
MAXWELL, WHAT WENT ON BACK THERE?
OH, NOTHING, AUNT BERTHA.
JUST A LITTLE DISCREPANCY OVER SALARY.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, MAXWELL?
ALL IN A DAY'S WORK, AUNT BERTHA.
MAX, TAKE YOUR UNCLE'S ADVICE-- GET OUT OF THE SHOE BUSINESS BEFORE IT KILLS YOU.
Bertha: I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
I TOLD YOU HE WAS ACTING FUNNY.
WHAT'S THE POOR THING GOING TO DO FOR A LIVING NOW?
WHERE WILL HE EVER GET ANOTHER JOB?
OH, KNOWING MAXWELL, HE'LL FIND SOME OTHER SHOE STORE FULL OF ENEMY SPIES.
ABNER, I'VE GOT A WONDERFUL IDEA.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE HIM INTO BUSINESS WITH YOU?
RECOMMEND HIM TO A FRIEND?
I KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU BUY THE SHOE STORE?
IT WOULD PROBABLY BE A STEAL.
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.
AND MAXWELL CAN RUN IT FOR YOU.
THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.
MORNING, AUNT BERTHA, UNCLE ABNER.
Bertha: GOOD MORNING, MAXWELL.
YOUR UNCLE AND I ARE SO CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, AUNT BERTHA.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.
BUT MAXWELL, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?
OH.
WELL, UH I SOLD SHOES BEFORE.
NOW I'LL SELL SOMETHING ELSE.
A GOOD SALESMAN CAN SELL ANYTHING.
I COULD SELL SUITS, OR I COULD SELL LAMPS, OR PAINTINGS.
WHY, I COULD EVEN SELL COUCHES.
Bertha: OHH.
HELP!
OHH.
ABNER, GET ME OUT OF HERE.
WHY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?
GO ON A FERRIS WHEEL?
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
CALLING KROCHANSKA.
CALLING KROCHANSKA.
ACCORDING TO MY PREVIOUS OBSERVATION, THE COURIER SHOULD BE REMOVING THE BRIEFCASE NOW.
DROP IT.
I SAID DROP IT, OR I'LL SHOOT.
SO YOU ARE THE THIEF.
WELL THAT SOLVES ONE MYSTERY.
Now, who are you working for?
THE PELLET, KROCHANSKA.
THE PELLET.
Max: SLIDE FOUR, CHIEF.
THIS WAS TAKEN ABOARD THE ORIENT EXPRESS BY THE AUSTRIAN POLICE IN INNSBRUCK.
THE SUBJECT IS AGENT 85, DECEASED.
AGENT 85 WAS THE FOURTH COURIER TO LEAVE PARIS WITH A BRIEFCASE CHAINED TO HIS WRIST.
NOT ONE REACHED HIS DESTINATION ALIVE.
YOUR CONCLUSION, 86?
- SUICIDE, CHIEF.
- SUICIDE?
BUT MAX, HE WAS GASSED.
WELL, I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HIS DRINKING HABITS, 99, BUT THERE'S A SUICIDE NOTE ON THE FLOOR.
THAT'S HIS TICKET.
OH.
SLIDE FIVE.
SO WE BID A FOND FAREWELL TO THE PACIFIC PARADISE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
THAT'S ANOTHER CASE.
- WHO IS THAT?
- GEORGE ROBINSON.
KAOS AGENT, HAWAIIAN BRANCH.
- FABULOUS DISGUISE.
- I SAW THROUGH IT IN ONLY ONE MINUTE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
ONE MINUTE.
I FIND THAT VERY DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE TWO MINUTES?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT OUR FOURTH DATE?
THE ENEMY KNOWS WE MUST SEND ANOTHER COURIER.
OUR ONE CHANCE IS THAT THEY WON'T BE EXPECTING A WOMAN.
I UNDERSTAND, CHIEF, I'LL DO THE BEST I CAN.
IT'S A DIRTY, DANGEROUS JOB.
IT WILL REQUIRE INTELLIGENCE, DETERMINATION AND ICY NERVES.
WILL I BE ISSUED A DESTRUCT PELLET, CHIEF?
- YES, 99.
- WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF SENDING HER?
- SHE'S A WOMAN.
- MAX, THANK YOU.
BEING A WOMAN IS THE REASON WE CHOSE HER.
FOUR MEN FAILED-- AGENTS 82 THROUGH 85.
NOW, THIS BRIEFCASE MUST BE GOTTEN TO B-12, SOMEWHERE IN THE BALKANS.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, CHIEF.
AND IT'S REAL LEATHER TOO.
DO YOU THINK HE'LL LIKE IT?
MAX, IT CONTAINS A HALF MILLION DOLLARS.
HE'LL LOVE IT.
IT'S THE PAYROLL FOR OUR FREELANCE AGENTS BEHIND THE IRON CURTAIN.
THEY HAVEN'T BEEN PAID IN FIVE MONTHS.
IF THEY COMPLAIN TO THE GRIEVANCE COMMITTEE OF THE SPIES GUILD EAST WE ARE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
WHY, THOSE BABIES ARE MURDER AT THE BARGAINING TABLE.
WHY, DO YOU KNOW THAT THEY GET DISABILITY COMPENSATION FOR FLESH WOUNDS?
MAX, MAY I GET ON WITH THIS BRIEFING?
CARRY ON, CHIEF.
NOW, 99, THIS SECURITY BRIEFCASE HAS JUST BEEN DEVELOPED BY THE LAB.
ONCE IT IS ATTACHED TO THE WRIST, THERE ARE ONLY TWO WAYS OF GETTING IT OFF.
- ONE BY USING A KEY.
- GOOD.
HOWEVER THERE IS ONLY ONE KEY THAT WILL FIT THIS LOCK.
ANYONE TRYING TO USE ANOTHER KEY WILL RECEIVE 5,000 VOLTS OF ELECTRICITY THROUGH HIM.
- WOW!
- WHERE IS THE ONE KEY THAT FITS, CHIEF?
B-12, THE AGENT WHO WILL BE RECEIVING THIS BRIEFCASE, ALREADY HAS IT.
HE'LL BE ONBOARD THE TRAIN.
- HOW WILL I KNOW HIM?
- YOU'LL RECEIVE FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS FROM OUR CONTACTS ONBOARD THE TRAIN.
THIS CERTAINLY IS AN INGENIOUS DEVICE, CHIEF.
YOU JUST CLAP IT ON YOUR WRIST, RIGHT?
AND THERE'S ONLY TWO WAYS TO GET IT OFF.
ONE IS WITH THE KEY ON THE TRAIN.
IN THE - WHAT'S THE OTHER WAY, CHIEF?
- AMPUTATION.
AMPUTATION.
OH, MAX.
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT FOR ME.
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'LL BE TAKING A LONG TRIP, 86.
NOW LET'S GO TO THE LAB.
MAYBE MINELLI HAS COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT WILL GIVE YOU A FIGHTING CHANCE.
MAX, THAT WAS THE NOBLEST, BRAVEST MOST HEROIC THING I'VE EVER SEEN.
THANK YOU.
MAYBE I COULD SOAK MY WRIST.
MAX, I DON'T THINK YOU'VE MET OUR NEW SPECIAL WEAPONS ADVISOR, DR.
MINELLI.
DR.
MINELLI, THIS IS AGENT 86, MAXWELL SMART.
- I BELIEVE YOU KNOW 99.
- YES, I DO.
- HOW ARE YOU, SMART?
- NICE TO MEET YOU, MINELLI.
I SEE YOU PLAY CHESS.
WELL, I AMUSE MYSELF WITH A GAME OR TWO NOW AND THEN.
SO DO I. WELL, I SEE YOU'VE GOT AN INTERESTING PROBLEM HERE, BUT I THINK I KNOW THE ANSWER.
THAT'S CHECKERS.
WELL, WHAT'S NEW IN SPECIAL WEAPONS, MINELLI?
WHAT YOU HAVE IN MIND, SMART?
DR.
MINELLI, ALL OF THE AGENTS WHO WERE KILLED WHERE VICTIMS OF A HIGHLY TOXIC GAS.
I WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO GIVE 86 THAT WILL PROTECT HIM.
I THINK I GOT JUST THE THING.
HERE.
HEY, TRY THIS ON, SMART.
OH.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.
BUT I THINK IT'LL CLASH WITH MY TRENCH COAT, DON'T YOU, CHIEF?
WHEN YOU YANK DOWN ON THE RIM, THE BOWLER CONVERTS INTO A GAS MASK.
LOVELY.
CHIEF, SHOULD I ISSUE 86 A PAIR OF STRATO SHOES?
A PAIR OF WHAT?
STRATO SHOES-- IT'S ONE OF DR.
MINELLI'S LATEST DEVELOPMENTS.
LET'S LOOK AT THEM.
THE WEARER OF THESE SHOES, CAN OBTAIN INSTANT HEIGHT BY MERELY KNOCKING HIS HEELS TOGETHER.
IT'S A MARVELOUS DEVICE FOR INSTANT ESCAPE FROM DANGER.
I DON'T THINK I QUITE UNDERSTAND.
WELL, I'LL DEMONSTRATE USING JUST ONE SHOE.
NOW, HERE'S THE ACTIVATING MECHANISM INSIDE THIS HEEL.
NOW, WATCH WHAT HAPPENS WHEN I PRESS IT.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
YES, BUT EXACTLY WHAT DOES IT DO?
THERE'S A MINIATURE CAPSULE OF HIGHLY COMPRESSED AIR BURIED INSIDE EACH HEEL.
NOW CLICKING THE HILLS TOGETHER SETS OFF A JET STREAM THAT LIFTS THE WEARER OFF THE GROUND.
BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU ONLY ACTIVATE ONE OF THE SHOES WHILE YOU'RE WEARING THEM?
WELL, I IMAGINE YOU'D DRIVE YOUR LEG UP THROUGH YOUR HEAD.
THEN YOU'D ADVISE AGAINST THAT?
CHIEF, HAVE YOU GIVEN 86 A FULL EXPLANATION OF THE BRIEFCASE?
EXCEPT THE ALARM SYSTEM.
NOW, OF COURSE YOU KNOW ABOUT THE KEY.
AGENT B-12 HAS THE ONLY KEY THAT WILL OPEN THE LOCK.
AND HE WILL BE SOMEWHERE ON THAT TRAIN.
OH YES, I REMEMBER NOW.
A WRONG KEY INSERTED IN THIS LOCK WILL SET OFF AN ELECTRICAL CHARGE OF 5,000 VOLTS.
AND OF COURSE THE NOISE WILL BRING HELP RUNNING.
WHAT NOISE?
YOUR SCREAMS.
MY SCREAMS?
NOW, ONE MORE QUESTION-- WHAT IF SOMEONE TRIES TO TAKE THE BRIEFCASE AWAY FROM ME WITHOUT BREAKING THE LOCK?
THE SLIGHTEST TUG ON THAT CHAIN WILL SET OFF A SIREN YOU CAN HEAR FOR A MILE AND A QUARTER.
- HOW DO YOU TURN OFF THE ALARM?
- WELL, YOU JUST PUSH THE BUTTON.
WELL, CHIEF, I GUESS THAT ABOUT WRAPS IT UP.
I THINK I'M JUST ABOUT READY TO GO.
-  -  - WHERE IS IT?
- IT'S ON THE OTHER END.
- WHAT OTHER END?
- THIS END.
-  -  - 44?
- YES, 86.
WELCOME ABOARD.
I WAS TOLD THAT YOU'D BE MY FIRST CONTACT.
- CORRECT.
- YOU HAVE ANYTHING FOR ME?
YES.
WELL?
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU THIS, 86-- I HAVEN'T BEEN PAID IN FIVE MONTHS.
YES, I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT, 44.
THAT'S WHAT THIS MISSION IS ALL ABOUT.
NOW, CAN I PLEASE HAVE THE MESSAGE?
I MEAN AFTER ALL, 86, SECRET AGENTS HAVE TO LIVE TOO.
NOW, THE SPIES' STANDARD AGREEMENT CLEARLY STATES-- YES, I KNOW ALL ABOUT THE SPIES' STANDARD AGREEMENT, AND I PROMISE YOU, YOU'LL GET PAID JUST AS SOON AS I DELIVER THE BRIEFCASE.
NOW, CAN I HAVE THE MESSAGE, PLEASE?
YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING COSTS SO MUCH TODAY.
GUNS AND KNIVES ARE EXPENSIVE, POISON IS UP, AND STRANGLING WIRE IS $6.80 A YARD.
PLEASE, 44.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT COSTS TODAY TO BUILD A HALFWAY DECENT INFERNAL MACHINE?
ALL RIGHT, 44.
ALL RIGHT.
HERE, THIS SHOULD TIDE YOU OVER FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
THANKS, 86.
YOU KNOW, I EVEN HAD TO PAY TO GET ON THIS TRAIN?
AND THIS IS A FIRST-CLASS MEDICINE CHEST.
YES, I KNOW, I KNOW, 44.
NOW WILL YOU PLEASE GIVE ME THE MESSAGE?
HERE.
MAKE SURE YOU DESTROY IT.
RIGHT.
IS ANYONE IN HERE?
YES, THIS IS MY COMPARTMENT.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY, BUT I WONDER IF I MIGHT JUST LEAVE SOME OF MY MERCHANDISE IN YOUR COMPARTMENT.
THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ROOM IN MINE.
CERTAINLY.
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR HELP.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'LL JUST SIT DOWN AND REST FOR A MOMENT, I'M QUITE EXHAUSTED.
MY NAME, BY THE WAY, IS MR.
ERNST.
I'M MAXWELL SMART.
- WHAT IS IT?
- SHH.
I'M NOT ALONE.
AND I HAD TO DESTROY THE FIRST MESSAGE.
DO YOU HAVE A COPY?
WELL, YOU KNOW, 86, SECRET MESSAGE PAPER DOESN'T GROW ON TREES.
ALL RIGHT, 44.
HOW MUCH?
- $5.00.
- $5.00?
THAT'S THE GOING PRICE.
OR THREE FOR $10.00.
NO, I'LL JUST TAKE ONE.
THANKS.
SORRY TO DISTURB YOU, SIR, BUT I WONDERED IF YOU'D LIKE SOME DINNER.
NO THANK YOU.
I JUST ATE.
PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO SEE A MENU AND YOU CAN ORDER LATER.
THANK YOU.
INCIDENTALLY, TONIGHT-- TALK ABOUT CHEAP!
- AGAIN?
- YES.
INCIDENTALLY, THOSE SECRET MESSAGES TASTE TERRIBLE.
WHAT KIND OF INK ARE YOU USING?
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH GOOD INK COSTS?
NEVER MIND, 44.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER COPY OF THE MESSAGE?
SHOULD HAVE TAKEN THREE FOR 10.
CAN'T YOU JUST READ IT TO ME?
OKAY.
AND KEEP YOUR VOICE LOW.
THE BRIEFCASE WILL BE PICKED UP BY AGENT B-12 WHO WILL USE THE PASSWORD "TANGANYIKA".
- "TANGANYIKA"?
- "TANGANYIKA".
- IS THAT ALL?
- THAT'S ALL.
OH, I'M SORRY, I SEE THAT MONSIEUR IS STILL HAVING HIS DINNER.
YOU CAN PUT MY BAGS UP THERE.
YES, MADAME.
I BELIEVE THIS IS A PRIVATE COMPARTMENT.
OH, KIND SIR, IS JUST FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND THERE'S NO OTHER SEAT AVAILABLE.
SURELY YOU WOULD NOT DENY A LADY IN DISTRESS?
SURELY NOT.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
YOU ARE A GENTLEMAN.
SOMEDAY I HOPE YOU WILL COME TO ROMANIA AND AVAIL YOURSELF OF MY HOSPITALITY.
OH, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THAT WOULD BE A PLEASURE.
I AM THE COUNTESS RIFCHEVSKY.
I AM THE MAXWELL SMART.
WE'RE JUST ENTERING LICHTENSTEIN.
PASSPORTS, PLEASE.
MADAME.
MONSIEUR.
OKAY.
AH, LICHTENSTEIN, WHAT A LOVELY SMALL COUNTRY.
WE'RE JUST LEAVING LICHTENSTEIN.
PASSPORTS, PLEASE.
- WHAT TOOK US SO LONG?
- FLOODS.
HAD TO EVACUATE THE COUNTRY.
BONJOUR.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, BUT YOU'RE SITTING IN MY SEAT.
OH, PARDON.
AH, I DON'T BELIEVE YOU TWO LADIES HAVE MET.
THIS IS THE COUNTESS.
- I'M SORRY BUT I DIDN'T CATCH YOUR TITLE.
- MADEMOISELLE.
YOU KNOW THIS WORD?
DOING HERE?
DINNER IS BEING SERVED IN THE DINING CAR.
WOULD ONE OF YOU GENTLEMEN CARE TO ACCOMPANY ME?
MY PLEASURE, COUNTESS.
COME, CYRIL.
CYRIL?
THANK YOU, SIR.
MADAME.
MONSIEUR.
WILL MONSIEUR BE COMING DOWN FOR DINNER?
I'M GOING TO FIND AGENT B-12 INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR HIM TO FIND ME.
- HOW WILL YOU KNOW HIM?
- BY THE CODE WORD "TANGANYIKA".
BE CAREFUL, MAX.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- OH, EXCUSE ME.
- COME IN, MR.
SMART.
WE FINALLY FOUND MY COMPARTMENT.
WON'T YOU JOIN US IN A CUP OF WINE, IF YOU DON'T MIND PAPER CUPS?
THANK YOU.
I DON'T MIND IF I DO.
BEAUJOLAIS, 1957.
DIXIE CUP, 1965.
- IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- YES, THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW, THE MARVELOUS THING ABOUT TRAVELING IS ALL THE WONDERFUL PEOPLE YOU MEET, LIKE EACH OF YOU.
I AGREE WITH YOU, COUNTESS.
UH, HAVE ANY OF YOU EVER BEEN TO AFRICA?
YES, I'VE TRAVELED THERE EXTENSIVELY.
I SPENT THREE YEARS THERE.
IT'S MY FAVORITE CONTINENT.
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION AND I WANT YOU TO THINK VERY CAREFULLY BEFORE YOU ANSWER.
WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE COUNTRY IN AFRICA?
All: TANGANYIKA!
THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.
IT'S A NEW FAD DIET.
ALL THE VITAMINS AND NONE OF THE CARBOHYDRATES.
HANG ON, IT'S DEAD MAN'S CURVE.
- BE CAREFUL!
-  - Ernst: WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- Countess: THE LIGHTS HAVE GONE OUT.
- OOH!
- EXCUSE ME.
THIS ALWAYS HAPPENS ON DEAD MAN'S CURVE.
AND HERE COMES THE OTHER HALF OF IT.
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- Countess: THE LIGHTS HAVE GONE OUT AGAIN.
MY BRIEFCASE!
IT'S GONE.
- LET ME TAKE IT.
- MR.
SMART, I INSIST-- - WHAT HAPPENED?
- KROCHANSKA MADE A TRY FOR THE BRIEFCASE.
- THEN YOU KNOW WHO KROCHANSKA IS.
- I'M ALMOST POSITIVE.
- WHO, MAX?
- IT'S SOMEBODY ON THIS TRAIN.
- YES, BUT WHO?
- THE COUNTESS.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
THAT LOVELY COUNTESS.
- I FIND THAT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.
- THE PORTER?
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- THE CONDUCTOR?
- NO, HUH-UH.
- THE ENGINEER.
- HOW ABOUT THE DOG?
- MAX!
IT'S GOTTA BE ONE OF THEM, 99.
THERE'S NOBODY ELSE LEFT.
-  - AHA!
JUST AS I THOUGHT-- ERNST THE PHONY BLIND MAN.
NO, MR.
SMART.
ERNST THE BLIND BRITISH SPY.
THEN IT WAS YOU WHO PUT THE MESSAGE IN THE CUP.
IT WAS REALLY NOTHING, OLD MAN.
JUST SPUR OF THE MOMENT AND ALL THAT.
IT WAS SOMETHING TO ME.
YOU PULLED ME OUT OF A TIGHT SPOT.
AH WELL, ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.
COME IN AND SIT DOWN.
BRITISH INTELLIGENCE IS ALWAYS WELCOME.
NO THANKS.
I RAN INTO A SPOT OF TROUBLE ON THE WAY OVER.
SEEM TO HAVE TAKEN ONE IN THE BACK.
SILLY OF ME.
I'M AFRAID I'M GOING TO PACK IT IN, OLD MAN.
- I SAY - HMM?
WHO IS KROCHANSKA?
DON'T THINK I'LL LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO SAY.
PITY.
CALLING KROCHANSKA.
NOW BRING ME THE BRIEFCASE.
MAX, LOOK.
HERE, BOY.
BRING IT OVER HERE.
MAX, BE CAREFUL.
Don't do anything rash.
A sudden move may cost you a hand.
THE OLD SPY-IN-THE-DOG-SUIT TRICK.
So, Mr. Smart.
Believe me, it is a pleasure to meet you at last.
I have long anticipated the day when we would match wits, you and I. May I introduce myself?
MY NAME IS DEMETRIOS.
TOO BAD THAT OUR FIRST MEETING WILL ALSO BE OUR LAST.
YOU SEE IT, 99?
A RADIO RECEIVER AND A MICROSPEAKER IN THE DOG'S COLLAR.
- DOUBLE AGENT.
- Excellent, Mr. Smart.
Excellent.
YOU MORE THAN LIVE UP TO MY EXPECTATIONS.
AND YOU ARE QUITE CORRECT-- THIS WILL BE OUR LAST MEETING.
Pellet.
THE PELLET, KROCHANSKA.
WE'RE LOCKED IN.
GET YOUR GAS MASK.
-  - 99: DON'T BREATHE.
HE HAD TO BE A HAT SALESMAN.
You'll note, Mr. Smart, The gas has no effect on dogs.
HUMANS HOWEVER ARE RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS WITHIN THE FIRST 30 SECONDS.
DEATH WILL OCCUR WITHIN ONE MINUTE.
You now have 36 seconds in which to live.
- MAX, WHERE'S YOURS?
-  HERE, MAX, HERE.
TRY THAT.
-  - DON'T BREATHE, MAX.
SO MUCH FOR COURIER #5.
COME ALONG, KROCHANSKA.
-  - GOOD WORK, MAX.
- COME ON, 99.
LET'S OPEN THE WINDOWS.
- RIGHT.
TICKETS PLEASE.
MONSIEUR.
- MADAME.
- THANK YOU.
UH, I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS MESS, CONDUCTOR.
IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.
IF YOU THINK THIS IS BAD, YOU SHOULD SEE COMPARTMENT 13.
AND THEN THE AUSTRIAN POLICE TOOK DEMETRIOS INTO CUSTODY.
- AND THE DOG?
- REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THAT DOG, CHIEF-- HE WAS TRAINED AS A DOUBLE AGENT-- A PRACTICED THIEF AND A NATURAL KILLER.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
- HE WAS ADOPTED BY A NICE FAMILY.
- LOTS OF KIDS.
- SO ALL THE LOOSE ENDS ARE TIED UP?
THAT'S RIGHT, CHIEF.
ALL THE AGENTS ARE BACK AT WORK AND PAID.
GOOD.
WE CAN'T LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.
THE SECURITY OF THE WHOLE WESTERN WORLD DEPENDS ON OUR WORK.
I KNOW, CHIEF.
I WAS TALKING TO SOME OF THEIR REPRESENTATIVES ABOUT IT.
GOOD.
NOW ABOUT YOUR NEXT ASSIGNMENT-- ON SATURDAY I WANT YOU TO FLY TO BANGKOK AND GET IN TOUCH WITH AGENT-- UH, WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
YOU REALIZE OF COURSE IF WE LEAVE ON SATURDAY - THAT THAT WILL BE TIME AND A HALF.
- WHAT?
OF COURSE WHEN WE GET TO BANGKOK, THAT'S OVERSEAS PAY.
AND THEN SUNDAY'S DOUBLE TIME.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- IT'S ALL RIGHT HERE IN THE SPY GUILD UNION BOOK, CHIEF.
- ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS READ IT.
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
I NEVER HEARD OF ANYTHING-- THE CHIEF OF OVERSEAS OPERATIONS GETS THREE WEEKS VACATION WITH PAY.
THAT'S NOT ALL-- LOOK AT THIS.
HE GETS HIS WARDROBE ALSO.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
THAT'S THE MOVE THAT WON THE CHAMPIONSHIP FOR LEONARD VERINSKI, THE EUROPEAN CHESS MASTER.
- CHECK.
- NO, HE WAS ROMANIAN.
OH, THE COFFEE IS BOILING, 52.
I'LL GET IT-- JUST AS SOON AS I MOVE MY KNIGHT.
I THOUGHT YOU'D MAKE THAT MOVE.
THERE.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, 52!
NOBODY LIKES A SORE LOSER.
THREE AGENTS MURDERED-- AND NOW 52 RIGHT HERE IN CONTROL.
- IN MY OWN LABORATORY.
- CLOSE TO HOME, ISN'T IT, PROFESSOR SONTAG?
ALL RIGHT, MAX, TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.
FIRST OF ALL, CHIEF, HE MOVED HIS PAWN TO HIS QUEEN-3.
THEN I MOVED MY KNIGHT TO MY BISHOP-4-- NO, MAX.
I MEAN DID HE DO ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS?
WELL, YES, AS A MATTER OF FACT HE DID, CHIEF.
HE LEFT HIS QUEEN UNGUARDED.
MAX, WILL YOU FORGET THE GAME?
AN AGENT HAS BEEN MURDERED-- THE THIRD CONTROL AGENT IN AS MANY WEEKS, AND ALWAYS ON THE WEEKEND.
CAN YOU THINK OF ANY REASON WHY IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE THE WEEKEND?
MAYBE THE KILLER WORKS DURING THE WEEK.
WHAT TROUBLES ME MOST IS ALL THE VICTIMS HAVE THE SAME SUSPICIOUS MARKS.
MARKS?
WHAT MARKS, CHIEF?
LOOK AT HIS NECK.
NOT HIS NECK, MAX, AGENT 52'S.
OH, RIGHT, CHIEF.
OH YES, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN.
TWO TINY PUNCTURE MARKS ABOUT AN INCH APART.
- CHIEF, YOU DON'T SUPPOSE-- - OF COURSE I DON'T.
ALL THAT PUBLICITY ABOUT VAMPIRES IS JUST THE NEWSPAPERS' WAY OF BOOSTING CIRCULATION.
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, CHIEF.
IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK OF A VAMPIRE ABROAD IN THE 20th CENTURY.
IT'S INCREDIBLE IN ANY CENTURY, MAX.
VAMPIRES ARE A MYTH.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, PROFESSOR SONTAG?
THERE ARE BOUNDARIES TO THE SCOPE OF SCIENTIFIC KNOWLEDGE.
IT IS SAID, YOU KNOW, THAT WHEN A VAMPIRE STRIKES IT LEAVES TWO MARKS VERY MUCH LIKE THESE ON THE NECK.
BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS, PROFESSOR SONTAG.
THAT'S AN OLD WIVES' TALE.
- YOU'RE RIGHT, MAX.
- OF COURSE I'M RIGHT, CHIEF.
WEREWOLVES LEAVE MARKS ON THE NECK, VAMPIRES GO RIGHT FOR THE THROAT.
MAX, THERE ARE NO SUCH THINGS AS VAMPIRES.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
IT'S A GOOD THING WE'RE ALL SENSIBLE CIVILIZED MEN - WHO DON'T BELIEVE IN A LOT OF SUPERSTITIOUS NONSENSE.
- RIGHT.
MAX!
DON'T WALK UNDER THAT.
THE NEWSPAPERS ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY, MAX.
THE PEOPLE OF WASHINGTON ARE TERRIFIED OF THIS SO-CALLED VAMPIRE MURDERER.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP HIM BEFORE ANYONE ELSE IS KILLED.
I KNOW, CHIEF, THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK ARE AFRAID TO GO OUT AT NIGHT.
THEY'RE AFRAID OF THE VAMPIRE?
NO, THEY'RE JUST AFRAID TO GO OUT AT NIGHT.
-  - WHAT IS IT?
OH, ARRICK.
DOES HE HAVE THE DETECTO-TUNE WITH HIM?
GOOD.
SEND HIM RIGHT DOWN.
NOW, MAX, WHAT ELSE DID YOU COME UP WITH IN YOUR RESEARCH?
WELL, CHIEF, I PICKED UP SOME VERY IMPORTANT FACTS ABOUT VAMPIRES.
- WHAT IS IT?
- LET'S SEE "IN 1958 DR.
FRANZ HEISER APPEARED BEFORE THE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF SCIENTISTS IN VIENNA AND PRESENTED A PAPER THAT CLAIMED VAMPIRES DO EXIST".
OF COURSE THEY DISCREDITED HIS THEORY.
- WHAT HAPPENED TO DR.
HEISER?
- HE FLEW AWAY.
- WHAT?
- IN A PLANE, CHIEF.
MAX!
NOW OUR ONE CLUE IS THE MELODY YOU HEARD JUST BEFORE THE MURDER.
- OH, ARRICK, IS THE DETECTO-TUNE READY?
- YES, CHIEF.
- GOOD.
- NOW HOW DOES IT WORK?
THE DETECTO-TUNE CAN RECONSTRUCT ANY MELODY IN THE SAME WAY THAT A CRIMINAL'S FACE CAN BE RECONSTRUCTED FROM THE DESCRIPTIONS OF WITNESSES.
- CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE NOTES THAT YOU HEARD?
- HUM ANYTHING YOU REMEMBER.
LET ME SEE NOW, CHIEF UH   A LITTLE FASTER THAN THAT.
- ARRICK!
- SORRY, CHIEF.
TRY TO GET IT, MAX.
THIS MAY BE VITAL.
ALL RIGHT, CHIEF, NOW LET ME SEE   NO NO NO.
YEAH, YOU GOT IT.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAX?
I'M PUTTING YOU DOWN FOR THE LEAD IN THE "SPY FROLICS," CHIEF.
MAX!
ARRICK, HAS SONTAG FINISHED THE AUTOPSY YET?
I THINK SO.
HE'LL BE WITH US IN A MOMENT.
HE'S ON THE PHONE.
WAIT, DR.
DRAGO.
DON'T HANG UP.
DRAGO, DRAGO.
DRAGO WHERE HAVE I HEARD THAT NAME?
DRAGO DRAGO OF COURSE!
DR.
DRAGO.
HE WAS THE PROFESSOR'S PREDECESSOR HERE AT THE LAB.
- THAT WAS BEFORE WE CAME TO CONTROL.
- WHY DID DRAGO LEAVE CONTROL?
I THINK HE WAS CAUGHT DOING SOME UNAUTHORIZED EXPERIMENTS.
OH, DR.
SONTAG, WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT FROM THE AUTOPSY?
- NOTHING.
- NOTHING?
YOU HEARD ME.
NOTHING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THE DETECTO-TUNE?
WELL, I HEARD THIS MELODY WHEN AGENT 52 DIED, AND-- WE WERE TRYING TO RECONSTRUCT THE TUNE.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS, SMART.
YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.
HOW DID THIS MELODY GO?
WELL, HAVE YOU EVER HEARD THE SONG "HEART OF MY HEART"?
- YES.
- THAT WASN'T IT.
TAKE OVER HERE, ARRICK.
I HAVE TO GO VISIT AN OLD FRIEND.
WILL YOU BE TAKING ANOTHER OF YOUR LONG WEEKENDS, PROFESSOR?
I DON'T KNOW, BUT I WANT YOU TO LOOK OVER THOSE REPORTS ON MY DESK.
PHONE CALLS TO DR.
DRAGO AND LONG WEEKENDS-- THERE'S SOMETHING FUNNY GOING ON HERE, 99.
I THINK WE'D BETTER PUT THE PROFESSOR UNDER SURVEILLANCE.
SHOULDN'T WE CHECK WITH THE CHIEF FIRST?
NO, THERE WON'T BE ANY TIME FOR THAT.
HE'S LEAVING NOW.
I DON'T WANT HIM TO KNOW WE'RE FOLLOWING HIM.
SONTAG'S GETTING IN HIS CAR, 99.
WE'D BETTER FOLLOW HIM.
BUT, MAX, SHOULDN'T WE STAY AND INVESTIGATE DRAGO?
HE MUST BE THE KEY TO ALL OF THIS.
BUT WHAT ARE WE GONNA TELL DRAGO IF WE FIND HIM?
THAT OUR CAR BROKE DOWN.
OH, COME ON, 99.
HE'LL NEVER FALL FOR THAT OLD GAG.
- COME ON, LET'S GO INTO THE HOUSE.
- WHAT DO WE TELL DRAGO?
- THAT OUR CAR BROKE DOWN.
- MAX, WHAT DO WE USE FOR COVER?
- I'VE GOT AN UMBRELLA IN THE TRUNK.
- NO, MAX, I MEAN A DISGUISE.
- OH, NOW LET'S SEE WHAT'S IN THE TRUNK.
- RIGHT.
-  -  OF THE TRUNK?
C-A-44-N.
LET'S SEE, WE'VE GOT THE NEWLYWEDS COVER, THE DIPLOMAT COVER, - THE LION TAMER COVER-- - LET'S USE THE NEWLYWEDS COVER.
I'VE BEEN DYING TO PLAY THAT ROLE.
OH, MAX, THEY'RE LOVELY!
- HERE, TAKE SOME RICE, 99.
- RIGHT.
I'D BETTER TAKE THE COMMANDO KIT.
WE MIGHT NEED IT LATER.
- GOOD THINKING.
- CLOSE THE TRUNK, 99.
- RIGHT.
- LET'S GO.
LOOK, 99, THERE'S SOMEONE THERE.
IT MUST BE DRAGO.
- WHAT'S HE DOING?
- HE'S GETTING INTO HIS COFFIN.
GETTING INTO HIS COFFIN?
GOOD EVENING.
IS THIS THE HONEYMOON MOTEL?
NO, IT IS NOT.
THIS IS MY HOME.
I AM DR.
SATYRADOS DRAGO.
OH, GOOD EVENING, DOCTOR.
I'M MAXWELL SMART AND THIS IS MY WIFE MRS.
SMART.
WE'RE ON OUR HONEYMOON, AND OUR CAR BROKE DOWN.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU COULD PUT US UP FOR THE NIGHT?
MY PRIVACY IS MOST IMPORTANT TO ME.
BESIDES, I DON'T THINK YOU WOULD BE COMFORTABLE HERE.
ON THE CONTRARY, DOCTOR, I THINK THIS IS A CHARMING PLACE, SO FRESH AND INVITING.
I THINK IT'S A PERFECT PLACE TO SPEND A HONEYMOON.
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'D CONSIDER SELLING IT.
THIS HOUSE IS IT IS SAID THAT MANY WEIRD AND TERRIBLE THINGS HAVE HAPPENED HERE.
THERE ARE FRIGHTENING NOISES AT NIGHT.
THE PEOPLE NEARBY SAY THAT THE TORTURED SPIRITS OF THE DEAD STILL INHABIT THESE ROOMS.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW?
- IS IT NEAR A SCHOOL?
-  STOP GROWLING, DEAR.
WE CAN ALWAYS HIRE A TUTOR.
MAX OH, HI THERE.
HUGO CANNOT ANSWER YOU, MR.
SMART.
UNFORTUNATELY, HE HAS LOST THE POWER OF SPEECH.
-  - WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE SAID, "UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE LOST THE POWER OF SPEECH".
AND NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME, I SHALL CALL A GARAGE AND SEE TO YOUR CAR.
YOU SAY IT BROKE DOWN ON THE ROAD.
WHICH ONE IS IT?
- IT'S A RED-AND-BLACK COUPE.
- NO NO, I MEAN WHICH ROAD IS IT?
THE ROAD RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR CASTLE, DOCTOR.
AH, HONEYSUCKLE ROAD.
HUGO, CLOSE THE FRENCH DOORS.
NOW LET US SEE ABOUT OUR GUESTS' AUTOMOBILE.
IT'S LOCKED.
WHAT DO WE DO NOW, MAX?
WELL, FIRST OF ALL, IN THIS COFFIN.
- OH, DO WE HAVE TO?
- WELL, YOU SEE, 99, ACCORDING TO THE LEGEND OF THE VAMPIRE, RIDICULOUS THOUGH IT MAY SEEM, VAMPIRES ALWAYS SLEEP IN THEIR COFFINS.
- WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?
- IF YOU GO AROUND BITING PEOPLE ON THE NECK, I GUESS YOU'LL DO JUST ABOUT ANYTHING.
MAX, I'M FRIGHTENED.
DON'T BE SILLY, 99.
ALL THESE STORIES ABOUT VAMPIRES AND WITCHCRAFT ARE RIDICULOUS.
WHY, THEY'RE NOTHING BUT FAIRY TALES TO FRIGHTEN LITTLE CHILDREN.
I GIVE YOU MY WORD THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO THEM.
RIGHT.
ON THE OTHER HAND, I COULD BE WRONG.
LISTEN, MAX, I HAVE AN IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE JUST CHECK OUT EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM FIRST?
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA, 99-- PROCESS OF ELIMINATION.
- HOW DOES THAT WORK?
- WE CHECK OUT EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM FIRST.
- GOOD THINKING.
I'LL START WITH THE DESK.
- RIGHT.
I THINK WE'RE BEING WATCHED.
- WHERE?
- LOOK CASUALLY OVER YOUR LEFT SHOULDER.
- NOTICE THE PORTRAIT?
- YES.
WHAT OF IT?
I THINK I SAW THE EYES MOVE.
OH, MAX, HOW COULD THEY?
VERY OFTEN IN OLD HOUSES LIKE THIS THEY HAVE SECRET PASSAGES AND THEY USE THE EYES OF PORTRAITS TO SPY THROUGH.
- YOU STAY HERE.
I'LL FIX IT.
- RIGHT.
- OKAY, 99.
- GOOD.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING, MAX?
- I THINK I'VE GOT A STONE FROM THE DRIVEWAY IN MY SHOE.
THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE EXCEPT THIS OLD INVOICE WITH SOME NUMBERS ON IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS, MAX?
- WOW!
- WHAT'S WRONG?
I DON'T KNOW.
EVERYTHING WENT BLACK FOR A MINUTE.
YOU PROBABLY BENT OVER TOO FAST.
WHERE'S THE INVOICE, MAX?
WHAT INVOICE?
THE ONE I JUST FOUND IN THE DESK.
YOU JUST TOOK IT.
LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING, 99.
NOW I SAT DOWN HERE IN THE CHAIR.
RIGHT, AND I STARTED GOING THROUGH THE DESK.
AND I LEANED OVER TO GET THE STONE OUT OF MY SHOE.
RIGHT, AND THEN I PICKED UP A PIECE OF PAPER.
I HELD IT UP IN MY HAND, AND I HELD IT OUT TO YOU.
OOH!
GOOD, YOU FOUND IT.
I'LL SAY I DID.
THIS IS THE BIGGEST PEBBLE I EVER SAW.
I THINK IT CUT OFF THE CIRCULATION IN MY EYES.
MAX, THERE'S NOTHING ON THIS PIECE OF PAPER.
WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, 99?
MAX, A FEW SECONDS AGO, I PICKED UP A PIECE OF PAPER FROM THE DESK, AND IT HAD SOME NUMBERS ON IT - YOU MUST BE IMAGINING THINGS.
- BUT YOU TOOK IT FROM ME.
- ALL RIGHT, 99, LET'S START FROM THE BEGINNING.
- RIGHT.
- I SAT DOWN IN THE CHAIR HERE.
- AND I BEGAN TO GO THROUGH THE DESK LIKE THIS.
AND I LEANED OVER TO-- IT DISTRESSES ME TO REPORT THAT YOUR CAR WON'T BE READY BEFORE TOMORROW MORNING.
WELL, THAT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO HOOF IT.
COME ON, HONEY.
-  -  WELL, IT WAS A ROTTEN NIGHT FOR A WALK ANYWAY.
MR.
SMART, YOU AND YOUR LOVELY BRIDE WILL BE MY GUESTS.
HUGO, SHOW THEM TO THEIR ROOM.
OH, AND SHOULD YOU HEAR ANY UNUSUAL NOISES DURING THE NIGHT, YOU NEEDN'T BE ALARMED.
IT WILL JUST BE HUGO PURSUING HIS CAREER.
- HIS CAREER?
- YES, HE WANTS TO BE A BAND SINGER.
-  - OH, FORGIVE ME, HUGO.
A BIG BAND SINGER.
NOW, HUGO, IF YOU WILL TAKE OUR GUESTS TO THEIR ROOM.
AND DON'T YOU LOVE THOSE CURTAINS?
OF COURSE IF THAT WERE MY CHAIR, I'D HAVE IT RECOVERED.
AND THE WHOLE ROOM, IF IT WERE PAINTED A LIGHTER COLOR, WOULD LOOK SO MUCH BIGGER.
OKAY, 99, THERE DON'T SEEM TO BE ANY MICROPHONES AROUND.
OH, I WISH I COULD REMEMBER WHAT WAS ON THAT PAPER IN THE LIBRARY.
FORGET IT, 99.
LET'S SEE WHAT CONTROL HAS GIVEN US IN THE NEWLYWED KIT.
THROWING KNIFE, KNOCKOUT DROPS, REVOLVER AND BRASS KNUCKLES.
THIS MUST BE THE COMMANDO KIT.
AH, THIS IS THE NEWLYWED KIT.
TOOTHPASTE, THROWING KNIFE, KNOCKOUT DROPS, REVOLVER AND BRASS KNUCKLES.
I KNOW THE PAPER HAD SOME NUMBERS ON IT, BUT WHAT COULD THEY MEAN?
IN TALKING ABOUT IT - IF YOU CAN'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS?
- WAIT A MINUTE, MAX.
WHAT DO THE YEARS AND 1952 MEAN TO YOU?
- THREE GREAT YEARS FOR BURGUNDY.
- NO, MAX.
THREE FAIR YEARS FOR BURGUNDY?
WAIT, TAKE THE "19" FROM IN FRONT OF EACH OF THOSE NUMBERS, AND WHAT DO WE HAVE?
- WHAT WERE THE NUMBERS AGAIN?
- 23, 49 AND 52.
- 99!
- WHAT?
THOSE WERE THE NUMBERS OF THE THREE AGENTS WHO WERE KILLED.
MAX, THEN THAT TIES DRAGO INTO THE MURDERS.
ANOTHER LOOK AROUND DOWNSTAIRS.
RIGHT, BUT WHAT IF WE'RE BEING WATCHED?
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE'VE GOTTA KEEP UP OUR COVER AT ALL TIMES.
WE'VE GOTTA DO EVERYTHING HONEYMOONERS DO.
HERE, THESE PAJAMAS ARE OUR BEST BET.
- GET INTO THEM.
- MAX!
THEY'RE BULLETPROOF, COME ON, 99.
DRAGO MUST BE ASLEEP BY NOW.
- WE'VE GOTTA TAKE A LOOK INSIDE THAT COFFIN.
- RIGHT.
BUT HUGO LOCKED US IN.
HOW ARE WE GONNA GET OUT?
WE'LL JUST USE THIS EXPANDO-RICE.
IN THE KEYHOLE, YOU GET THE SPECIAL TOOTHPASTE.
- RIGHT.
- IT'S MARKED "IGNITO-PASTE".
- COME ON, 99.
- THAT'S REALLY WILD RICE.
THE WILDEST!
-  - MAX, I HEAR SOMETHING.
SHH!
I THINK DRAGO HAS FINISHED HIS NAP.
LOOK, 99, THERE'S A STAIRWAY IN THE COFFIN.
EXACTLY, MR.
SMART.
THIS COFFIN HAS KEPT NOSY INTRUDERS FROM DISCOVERING THE ENTRANCE TO MY LABORATORY.
NOT MANY MEN HAVE THE COURAGE TO OPEN THE COFFIN.
ESPECIALLY FROM THE INSIDE.
YOU ARE A CLEVER MAN, MR.
SMART.
CLEVER ENOUGH TO SEE THROUGH YOUR SCHEME, DR.
DRAGO.
YOU KILLED THOSE AGENTS.
YOU WERE DRIVEN BY BITTERNESS BECAUSE OF YOUR DISMISSAL FROM CONTROL.
AND THEN WHEN YOU FOUND THAT YOU WERE UNDER SUSPICION, YOU THREW US A RED HERRING-- THE VAMPIRE.
YES.
WHEN I WAS DISMISSED BY CONTROL, I WAS DISGRACED IN MY PROFESSION.
I VOWED THAT ALL THE CONTROL AGENTS WHO TESTIFIED AGAINST ME WOULD PERISH.
HAVE YOU GUESSED HOW THE MURDERS WERE CARRIED OUT?
IT WAS THE MUSIC, MR.
SMART.
THE MUSIC?
THE MUSIC THEY PLAYED WHEN 52 DIED, OF COURSE.
PRECISELY, MR.
SMART.
I'LL SHOW YOU.
THIS TWIN-CHANNELED FLUTE IS MY FINEST INVENTION.
AT HIGH "C" IT FIRES TWO POISONED ICE PELLETS; THE ICE DISSOLVES; THE POISON DOES ITS WORK; AND THE POLICE ARE LEFT TO PONDER THE MYSTERIES OF VAMPIRES.
WELL, DR.
DRAGO, YOU'VE PLAYED YOUR LITTLE SONG OF DEATH FOR THE LAST TIME.
I BEG TO DIFFER, MR.
SMART.
HUGO!
OH, NO, MAX!
Drago: AND NOW, MR.
SMART, IT IS YOUR TURN TO HEAR MY SONATA OF DEATH.
BUT BEFORE I BEGIN, DO YOU HAVE ANY LAST REQUESTS?
YOU KNOW ANY SHOW TUNES?
-  - DROP THE FLUTE, DRAGO.
SONTAG, IF YOU SHOOT THE GIRL WILL DIE.
- SHOOT, SONTAG!
- NO, MAX!
MAX, WHAT'S HE SAYING?
I'M NOT SURE, 99, BUT I THINK IT'S "I GET NO KICK FROM CHAMPAGNE".
SO YOU SEE, ALTHOUGH I SUSPECTED DR.
DRAGO, I FELT I OWED HIM THE CHANCE TO PROVE HIS INNOCENCE.
- AFTER ALL, HE WAS MY TEACHER.
- SO YOU WENT TO HIS HOUSE THAT NIGHT - TO CONFRONT HIM WITH YOUR SUSPICIONS?
- YES.
AND THAT'S WHEN WE PUT YOU UNDER SURVEILLANCE.
- I KNOW.
- BUT WHAT YOU DIDN'T KNOW IS THAT 99 AND I WERE FOLLOWING YOU TO DRAGO'S PLACE IN A CONTROL TRACKING CAR, DID YOU?
NOT UNTIL I CAUGHT YOU IN MY REARVIEW MIRROR.
- WHEN WAS THAT?
- JUST AFTER YOU CRASHED INTO THE REAR END OF MY CAR.
WELL, YOU STOPPED AWFULLY SHORT, YOU KNOW.
INCIDENTALLY, MAX, DO YOU RECALL WHAT THAT MELODY WAS - THAT DRAGO WAS PLAYING?
- I'M NOT SURE, CHIEF.
- 99, DID YOU BRING THE FLUTE WITH YOU?
- IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.
OH, THANK YOU, 99.
- IS THAT THE MURDER WEAPON?
RIGHT, CHIEF.
ONLY NOW IT'S JUST A HARMLESS OLD FLUTE.
NOW LET'S SEE.
HOW DID THAT MELODY GO?
SMART!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
-  - FOOD, MORE FOOD, I'M RUNNING OUT OF FOOD.
WHAT KIND OF A HOTEL IS THIS?
-  - THAT'S THE ROOM SERVICE.
GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'M BILL BAMFORD, PRESIDENT OF THE RAMAT-AMERICAN OIL COMPANY.
- I'D LIKE TO SEE PRINCE SULLY.
- COME IN, MR.
BAMFORD.
GOOD AFTERNOON, YOUR MAJESTY.
IT'S A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
I'M HERE TO WELCOME YOU TO THE UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU.
YOUR MAJESTY, MY COMPANY FEELS THAT IF YOU COULD GET TOGETHER-- MR.
BAMFORD, PLEASE, I WILL DISCUSS ANYTHINGYOU WISH AS SOON AS I HAVE FINISHED MY LUNCH.
- AND THAT WILL BE - IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS.
- DO YOU WANT SOME HELP?
- NO.
IT'S A REFRIGERATOR, YOUR HIGHNESS.
OH, UH, PUT IT IN THE CORNER, PLEASE.
TELL ME, ARE ALL YOUR AMERICAN GIRLS LIKE THAT?
NO, YOUR HIGHNESS, SOME ARE REDHEADS AND BRUNETTES.
WHY DON'T YOU MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME?
UH, PUT YOUR COAT IN THE CLOSET.
THANK YOU, YOUR HIGHNESS.
THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
COME IN, CONTROL.
HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX.
I'M IN THE PRINCE'S HOTEL ROOM.
WE THINK THERE'S A PLOT AFOOT TO KIDNAP HIM SO DON'T LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.
I'VE CHECKED OUT EVERY CORNER OF THE HOTEL AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO SUSPICIOUS CHARACTERS ANYWHERE.
CARLA, THE UNIFORM.
CARLA, HELP ME WITH HIM.
I'LL KEEP MY EYE ON HIM EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF THE TIME, CHIEF.
I ONLY HAVE ONE MESSAGE TO REPORT-- "DON'T WORRY".
"DON'T WORRY".
- WHAT'S HE DOING NOW?
- HANG ON, CHIEF, I'LL SEE.
CHIEF, ABOUT THAT MESSAGE I JUST GAVE YOU-- CHANGE IT TO "WORRY".
"WORRY".
MAX, TRY TO THINK HARD.
WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT HOTEL ROOM?
HOW DID SULLY DISAPPEAR?
THERE MUST BE SOME CLUE THAT YOU OVERLOOKED.
I'VE TOLD YOU, CHIEF-- NOTHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED IN THE HOTEL ROOM, EXCEPT THAT THE PRINCE NEVER STOPPED EATING - FROM THE MOMENT I ENTERED.
- OF COURSE HE DIDN'T, - HE'S TRYING TO GAIN 35 LBS.
!
- OF COURSE-- - WHY?
- MAX, LOOK, THIS IS RAMAT, THE PRINCE'S COUNTRY.
EVERY YEAR HIS FOLLOWERS GIVE HIM HIS WEIGHT IN GOLD.
THAT'S THE MONEY THAT KEEPS THEIR COUNTRY SOLVENT!
OH, SO IT'S THE SURVIVAL OF THE FATTEST.
A LITTLE PLAY ON WORDS.
IF THE PRINCE DOESN'T WEIGH 300 LBS.
- NO GOLD.
- AND A NEW FACTION TAKES OVER THE GOVERNMENT, A FACTION THAT HAS ALREADY DEMONSTRATED ITS UNFRIENDLINESS TO THE UNITED STATES.
WELL, CHIEF, THEN THAT MEANS THAT RAMAT'S OIL SUPPLY TO THE UNITED STATES - WILL BE CUT OFF.
- THAT'S THE PICTURE.
WELL, THEN, IF THE PRINCE HAS BEEN KIDNAPPED WHY, THEY'LL BE TRYING TO REDUCE HIM.
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE HAVE EXACTLY BRING HIM BACK AND FATTEN HIM UP FOR THE WEIGH-IN.
NOW, MAX, TRY TO THINK HARD.
ISN'T THERE SOME LITTLE SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED IN THAT HOTEL ROOM THAT YOU MAY HAVE FORGOTTEN?
SORRY, CHIEF.
I'M AFRAID I'LL JUST HAVE TO SUBMIT MYSELF - TO THE GRILL TEAM.
- THE GRILL TEAM?
BUT THEY'RE ONLY USED TO GET INFORMATION OUT OF ENEMY AGENTS.
WE'VE NEVER USED THEM ON OUR OWN MEN.
I KNOW, CHIEF, BUT IF THEY CAN GET INFORMATION OUT OF THE ENEMY, THEN MAYBE THEY CAN GET SOMETHING OUT OF ME.
MAYBE THERE'S AN IMPORTANT CLUE LOCKED IN MY UNCONSCIOUS MIND.
AGENT 86, YOU MUST REMEMBER SOMETHING.
WATER, WATER-- - I'VE GOTTA HAVE SOME WATER.
- HERE, MAX.
THIS'LL HELP.
DON'T GIVE ME ANY WATER, CHIEF!
HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO BREAK DOWN AND TALK?
SORRY, MAX, I JUST CAN'T THINK OF YOU AS AN-- - AS AN ENEMY AGENT.
-  THERE MUST BE SOMETHING, THERE MUST BE SOMETHING UNUSUAL THAT I MISSED.
PLEASE HIT ME JUST ONCE MORE.
BUT, MAX, I CAN'T.
MY HAND'S BEGINNING TO HURT.
PLEASE, ONCE MORE, FOR CONTROL.
MAX, THINK VERY CLEARLY-- DID ANYTHING UNUSUAL HAPPEN IN THE HOTEL ROOM?
I'VE TRIED TO TELL YOU NOTHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED!
THE PRINCE WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA; AND THE HAREM GIRL; AND THE BODYGUARD WAS SERVING THE FOOD; AND THE CHAMBERMAID CARRIED IN THE REFRIGERATOR.
THE CHAMBERMAID CARRIED IN THE REFRIGERATOR?
HOLD IT, CHIEF, I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING UNUSUAL.
THE CHAMBERMAID CARRIED IN THE REFRIGERATOR.
THE CHAMBERMAID WITH SUPERSTRENGTH--  OF COURSE, MARY "JACK" ARMSTRONG.
RIGHT.
WHO?
MARY JACK ARMSTRONG, THE STRONGEST FEMALE COUNTERSPY IN THE WORLD.
MAX, YOU'VE GOT TO BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL.
SHE IS GORGEOUS AND DEADLY.
SO AM I. YES, SLIP ON THIS COAT, MR.
SMART.
NOW, LOOK LOOK LOOK--  WE'VE SEWN A HOMING DEVICE IN THIS SHOULDER.
I'LL TURN IT ON BY PRESSING THE BUTTON.
IT WILL LET US KNOW WHERE YOU ARE AT ALL TIMES.
OH, YOU MEAN I JUST DO THIS.
OH, NOW YOU'VE TURNED IT OFF.
LEAVE IT OFF, MAX, UNTIL YOU FIND OUT WHERE THE PRINCE IS.
- THEN ACTIVATE IT, AND WE MOVE IN.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
AND HERE IS A NEW NECKTIE FOR YOU, MR.
SMART.
AN AVOCADO TIE WITH A GREY SUIT?
WELL, I SUPPOSE THIS WILL MAKE ME #11.
- #11?
- YES, CHIEF.
I AM ONE OF THE IN THE COUNTRY.
OH, NO NO NO, THIS IS A VERY POPULAR SHADE AMONG SCIENTISTS, AND IT'S NO ORDINARY TIE.
IT'S ACTUALLY A CONTAINER.
NOW THIS LIQUID IS A NEWLY-DEVELOPED INSTANT TRUTH SERUM.
- POUR IT IN LIKE THIS -  THE LIQUID GOES THROUGH THE TUBE IN THE BACK OF THE TIE, AND WHEN YOU TURN THE SPIGOT ON THE CLASP, THE LIQUID FLOWS OUT.
IF YOU CAN GET THIS SERUM INTO SOMETHING THAT MARY JACK ARMSTRONG WILL DRINK, YOU CAN FIND OUT IMMEDIATELY WHERE SHE'S GOT THE PRINCE CAPTIVE.
BUT YOU ONLY HAVE ABOUT 15 SECONDS TO QUESTION HER - BEFORE SHE'LL LOSE CONSCIOUSNESS.
- GOT YA, CHIEF.
CHIEF, DID YOU MAKE MY HOTEL RESERVATIONS?
YES, YOU HAVE THE SAME ROOM THE PRINCE OCCUPIED.
I THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTACT THEM FROM THERE.
THE HOTEL IS ONLY TWO BLOCKS FROM HERE, SO IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG WE'LL BE THERE WITHIN A MINUTE.
NOW, MAX, THIS IS A DANGEROUS ONE.
THIS WOMAN IS RUTHLESS AND A POTENTIAL KILLER.
YOU'LL BE RISKING YOUR LIFE EVERY MOMENT.
AND LOVING IT.
IT'S IMPERATIVE WE CONTINUE TO REDUCE THE PRINCE'S WEIGHT FOR ANOTHER 48 HOURS.
BY THAT TIME NOTHING WILL HELP.
I'M GOING DOWNSTAIRS TO SEE WHAT SMART IS UP TO.
COME IN.
WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE THIS, SIR?
I'M AFRAID YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE.
I DIDN'T ORDER ANY CHAMPAGNE.
WELL, IT'S COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOTEL-- YOU ARE OUR ONE-MILLIONTH GUEST.
OH, REALLY?
I DIDN'T KNOW THE HOTEL WAS THAT BIG.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO FOR YOU, SIR?
UH  YOU DON'T HAPPEN TO HAVE - A CORKSCREW, DO YOU?
- OH, I'LL DO IT FOR YOU, SIR.
HERE YOU ARE.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN DO?
OH, WELL, AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A DRINK WITH ME?
I HAVE NO ONE ELSE TO DRINK WITH.
IT WOULD BE MY PLEASURE, SIR.
THERE YOU ARE.
I DON'T BELIEVE I CAUGHT YOUR NAME.
- MARY.
- MARY.
AH!
"MARY" IS A GRAND OLD NAME.
WELL, MARY, HERE'S TO YOUR STRENGTH-- UH, YOUR HEALTH.
- THANK YOU, MR.
- OH, I'M SORRY.
UH BILL BAMFORD, - PRESIDENT OF THE RAMAT- AMERICAN OIL COMPANY.
- I'VE SEEN MR.
BAMFORD.
HE'S A TALL WITH GREY HAIR.
- HE WAS A GUEST IN THE HOTEL ONCE.
- OH.
WELL, HOW ABOUT FRED LAMISTER, MUNITIONS?
- I THINK I'VE SEEN HIM.
- OH.
HARRY SCHLURB, TOY MANUFACTURER?
- WELL - MERVIN GRIBBS, CALLING- CARD MANUFACTURER?
- I'VE NEVER MET THE MAN.
- AH!
THEN MEET MERVIN GRIBBS.
HERE, LET ME FILL YOUR GLASS FOR YOU.
HERE WE ARE.
OOPS, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
COULD YOU GET A TOWEL FOR ME, PLEASE?
OH, YES.
- HERE YOU ARE, SIR.
- OH.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
OH, THERE YOU ARE.
WON'T YOU SIT DOWN, PLEASE?
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG?
UH, WELL, NO.
UH, THE WINE SEEMS A LITTLE STRONG.
I THINK IT'S TRYING TO ESCAPE.
OH.
THAT WAS A TURBULENT YEAR.
YOU SEEM TO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT WINE.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I SORT OF PRIDE MYSELF ON TRYING TO KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT EVERYTHING-- WINE, WOMEN, FOOD.
- WHAT ABOUT ART?
- ART?
I'VE OFTEN WONDERED WHO PAINTED THAT PICTURE ON THE WALL BEHIND YOU.
I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE OUT THE SIGNATURE.
- WHAT PICTURE?
- THERE.
WELL, I'M NOT QUITE SURE, BUT I THINK IT PROBABLY WAS THE SAME ARTIST THAT PAINTED THAT PICTURE OVER THERE IN THE CORNER.
HOW CLEVER OF YOU TO NOTICE.
THEN HE PROBABLY WAS THE SAME ARTIST WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT PICTURE OVER THE DESK.
- WHAT PICTURE?
- THAT ONE.
- DO I HAVE TO LOOK?
- YES.
- IS IT MY TURN?
- YES.
OKAY.
WELL, SHALL WE DRINK UP?
WELL, MARY JACK ARMSTRONG, IT LOOKS LIKE I'VE HAD THE LAST SWITCH.
- DOES IT?
- YES.
AND IN EXACTLY FIVE SECONDS, WHEN THAT DRUG TAKES EFFECT, YOU WILL TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
YOU WILL TELL ME-- MY NAME IS MAXWELL SMART, SECRET AGENT 86, AND I WAS SENT HERE BY CONTROL TO RESCUE THE PRINCE AND FATTEN HIM UP FOR THE WEIGH-IN, AND YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING OUT OF ME.
IT'S WEARING OFF.
- WHERE AM I?
- YOU'RE IN MY PRIVATE MASSAGE PARLOR AND REDUCING SALON ON THE TOP FLOOR OF THE HOTEL.
WELL, I'LL JUST TAKE A LITTLE RUBDOWN AND A FEW LAPS ON THE BIKE AND THEN I'M AFRAID I'LL HAVE TO LEAVE.
VERY FUNNY, MR.
SMART.
AND DON'T TRY TO GET FREE.
YOU'LL ONLY HURT YOURSELF IF YOU STRUGGLE.
LATER ON WE'LL DISPOSE OF YOU.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?
YES.
YOU'RE ALL UNDER ARREST.
MR.
SMART, I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND.
YOU ARE MY PRISONER, AND THE ONLY REASON YOU'RE STILL ALIVE IS BECAUSE NOW THAT WE KNOW CONTROL IS ON OUR TRAIL YOU CAN HELP US TO LEAD THEM DOWN A BLIND ALLEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING TO THE PRINCE?
MERELY GETTING HIM IN SHAPE FOR THE WEIGH-IN.
CARLA, WHAT IS HIS WEIGHT?
HE'S DOWN TO 274 LBS.
Max: ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, PRINCE SULLY?
YES, BUT I CAN FEEL MYSELF GETTING THINNER.
WELL, HANG ON, YOUR MAJESTY, AND THINK FAT.
RELEASE HIM.
YOU MAY LOWER YOUR HANDS, MR.
SMART.
I CAN'T.
MY SHOULDERS ARE LOCKED.
RHONDA, FIX MR.
SMART'S SHOULDER.
THERE!
NOW, MR.
SMART, YOU WILL TELEPHONE YOUR CHIEF, AND YOU WILL GIVE HIM SOME INFORMATION AS TO WHERE YOU ARE-- INFORMATION THAT WILL BE, OF COURSE, TOTALLY FALSE.
AND WHAT IF I REFUSE?
THEN I SHALL MAKE YOU DO IT.
YOU AND WHO ELSE?
GOT AN ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING, HAVEN'T YOU?
TAKE MR.
SMART TO THE PHONE.
NOW BE VERY CAREFUL, MR.
SMART.
ONE WRONG WORD, AND RHONDA AND CARLA WILL SEE THAT IT'S YOUR LAST.
ALL RIGHT, JUST WHAT IS IT YOU WANT ME TO SAY?
MERELY TELL YOUR CHIEF THAT EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE DISCOVERED NOTHING SO FAR, AND YOU WILL CALL HIM BACK IF YOU DO.
- HELLO?
- MAX?
- YES, CHIEF.
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M FINE, CHIEF.
YOU KNOW ME-- NEVER ANY PROBLEMS.
HE MUST BE IN TROUBLE.
WE JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB, MAX, AND THAT YOU DESERVE A BIG PAT ON THE SHOULDER.
- A PAT ON THE SHOULDER?
- THAT'S RIGHT, SMART, A PAT ON THE SHOULDER.
UH OKAY, CHIEF, AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.
I don't need any more help on this case than I did on my last case.
PARKER, HOW MANY MEN DO WE HAVE?
- OKAY, WHAT NOW?
- NOTHING.
YOU'RE FREE TO WATCH US REDUCE THE PRINCE, IF YOU LIKE.
CARLA AND I ARE GOING TO TURN THE MACHINE UP ALL THE WAY.
RHONDA WILL TEND TO YOUR NEEDS.
WATCH HIM.
YOU KNOW, IT'S GETTING AWFULLY CHILLY IN HERE.
UH, WOULD YOU MIND IF I PUT ON MY COAT?
WHY NOT?
THANK YOU.
AH, THAT FEELS MUCH BETTER.
-  - OH, CHIEF, SMART'S SIGNAL JUST WENT ON.
GET A READING ON HIS LOCATION.
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?
- HMM?
WHAT DID I DO WHAT FOR?
YOU SLAPPED YOUR SHOULDER.
- I DID?
- YES, RIGHT HERE.
- IT JUST WENT OFF.
- WHAT?
THE SIGNAL IS GONE!
YOU MEAN, I JUST PICKED UP AND SLAPPED MY SHOULDER LIKE THIS?
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING REASON WHY YOU KEEP DOING THIS.
TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT'S KIND OF A LITTLE NERVOUS HABIT WITH ME.
LOOK, IT'S MY NERVOUS HABIT, NOT YOURS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S HAPPENING?
I DON'T KNOW.
COULD HE BE PLAYING LEAPFROG?
THERE WE ARE.
NORTH NORTHWEST.
THERE.
THERE.
I THINK THIS IS IT.
LISTEN, RHONDA, YOU LOOK LIKE A SENSIBLE GIRL.
I THINK YOU AND I CAN MAKE A DEAL.
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY, MR.
SMART?
YOU LET ME ESCAPE AND I'LL SEE THAT YOU GET OFF EASY.
- HOW EASY?
- WELL, I CAN'T MAKE ANY PROMISES, BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS  THE LAW HAS A VERY SOFT SPOT IN ITS HEART FOR BIG BEAUTIFUL SPIES.
- MARY JACK!
- YES?
SMART WANTS ME TO HELP HIM ESCAPE.
OH, HE DOES?
WELL, LOCK HIM IN THE STEAM ROOM-- A LITTLE 150 HEAT OUGHT TO SOFTEN HIM UP.
COME ON!
- GET IN, SMART.
- COME ON.
ALL RIGHT, MARY JACK ARMSTRONG, YOU AND I ARE GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TRIP DOWN TO CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.
YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO FALL FOR THAT OLD TRICK, DO YOU?
- THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE BUT YOUR HAND.
- ALL RIGHT, GET YOUR HANDS UP AND DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES.
NOW, MR.
SMART, I'M GONNA BREAK YOU IN HALF.
WHAT HAPPENED?
!
THE OLD FINGER-IN-THE-GUN TRICK.
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE USED IT THIS MONTH.
PRETTY CLEVER, DON'T YOU THINK?
ALL RIGHT, MARY JACK, LET'S GO.
INTO THE STEAM ROOM!
COME ON, MOVE OUT!
WHAT KIND OF A GUN IS THAT, MR.
SMART?
IT'S A .
22-CALIBER FINGER-- FIRES TWO SHOTS.
ALL RIGHT, STAY WHERE YOU ARE.
DON'T ANYBODY MOVE!
YOUR FINGER'S EMPTY, MR.
SMART.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG, MARY JACK.
I STILL HAVE ONE SHOT LEFT.
- NO, YOU DON'T.
- YES, I DO.
NO, I DON'T.
YOU HAVE BECOME A NUISANCE, MR.
SMART.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT I DO WITH NUISANCES?
YOU IGNORE THEM AND HOPE THEY'LL GO AWAY?
- WRONG.
- WRONG.
YOU DON'T IGNORE THEM AND HOPE THEY'LL GO AWAY.
WRONG.
- WRONG AGAIN.
- I DISPOSE OF THEM - ONCE AND FOR ALL!
- THAT WAS MY NEXT GUESS.
CARLA, RHONDA.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, MARY JACK-- COME ON, THE WINDOW.
Chief: DROP THAT AGENT!
TAKE THOSE TWO DOWN TO HEADQUARTERS.
LEAVE HER.
- GOOD WORK, MAX.
-  THANK YOU, CHIEF, BUT I WISH YOU WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL WITH YOUR CHOICE OF WORDS.
YOU KNOW, THEY COULD HAVE DROPPED ME THE OTHER WAY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MAX.
LISTEN, CHIEF, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH MARY JACK.
THERE'S NO PRISON BUILT THAT CAN HOLD HER.
SHE'S THE STRONGEST, TOUGHEST, MOST VICIOUS OPPONENT I'VE EVER FACED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.
HELLO, MARY.
MARY?
HELLO, THADDEUS.
UM, I'M THE CHIEF NOW.
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU'D BEEN PROMOTED.
WELL, OF COURSE WE COULDN'T PUBLISH IT.
I'VE TRIED TO WRITE TO YOU, BUT THE-- WELL, THE ONLY ADDRESS I HAD WAS "CARE OF KAOS".
WELL, IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME.
YES, IT HAS.
YOU'VE BECOME EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL, IF THAT'S POSSIBLE.
AND YOU LOOK RATHER DISTINGUISHED.
WELL, IT'S PROBABLY THE GRAY HAIR.
THAT WILL BE ALL, MAX.
- I LIKE IT.
- THANK YOU.
UH, MARY, I DON'T MEAN TO PRY, BUT HOW DID A NICE GIRL LIKE YOU EVER GET INTO THIS ROTTEN BUSINESS?
WELL, THADDEUS, IT'S A LIVING.
THEY KNOW EACH OTHER?
YES, PRINCE, THAT'S THE WONDERFUL THING ABOUT THE ESPIONAGE BUSINESS-- YOU MAKE FRIENDSHIPS THAT LAST FOREVER.
DID THE PRINCE GET BACK TO HIS COUNTRY IN TIME, CHIEF?
HE MADE IT JUST IN TIME FOR THE WEIGH-IN.
DID HE MAKE THE 300-LB.
MINIMUM?
OH, HE WEIGHED IN AT EXACTLY 240 LBS.
- THEN HE LOST HIS KINGDOM.
- NO, THEY GAVE HIM THE GOLD ANYWAY.
HOW COME?
THE PRINCE WAS IN SUCH GREAT SHAPE PHYSICALLY FROM THE REDUCING MACHINE THAT THE WOMEN OF RAMAT HAVE MADE HIM A MATINEE IDOL.
YOU'RE KIDDING.
THEIR WHOLE STYLE IS CHANGED.
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IS ON A CRASH DIET.
THAT'S WONDERFUL, CHIEF.
OH, INCIDENTALLY, THE PRINCE SENT YOU A GIFT IN APPRECIATION OF YOUR SERVICES TO HIM AND TO HIS COUNTRY.
THAT'S VERY NICE OF THE PRINCE, CHIEF.
NOW, MAX, YOU KNOW THE POLICY OF CONTROL ON THINGS LIKE THAT.
CONTROL AGENTS ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ACCEPT GRATUITIES.
I KNOW THAT, CHIEF.
DON'T WORRY, I'LL SEND IT BACK TOMORROW.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW?
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Man's voice: Gentlemen, today I have our communique from KAOS International.
WE ARE ORDERED TO STIFLE THE HEARTBEAT OF THE CENTRAL MILITARY COMPLEX OF THE UNITED STATES.
THE PENTAGON?
We'll receive details of the plan at our next meeting.
IF WE ARE TO SUCCEED, WE MUST HAVE SOMEONE GUIDE US; SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE BUILDING AND WHO HAS TOTAL ACCESS TO IT, TOP CLEARANCE.
I KNOW SUCH A MAN.
HE'S A CONTROL AGENT.
Maxwell Smart.
Do you think we can recruit Maxwell Smart?
For a price.
IF NOT FOR MONEY, THERE IS ALWAYS THE LOVELY NATASHA.
YOU'RE TALKING FOOLISHLY, GENTLEMEN.
MAXWELL SMART IS A DEDICATED LOYAL AGENT.
But he's also stupid.
STOP!
NOBODY SAY ANYTHING.
GIVE ME THAT.
WHERE DID THIS GLASS WITH THE ICE CUBE COME FROM?
IT WAS HERE WHEN WE CAME IN.
THAT'S IT, THEY FOUND IT.
FOOLS!
DON'T YOU SEE?
THE ICE IN THIS GLASS HAS MELTED.
LOOK AT THIS ICE CUBE.
GERMANIUM CRYSTAL WITH A TRANSMITTING DEVICE INSIDE.
OH.
I CAN'T STAND IT WHEN THEY BREAK THOSE THINGS.
YOU KNOW, 99, I REALLY FEEL SORRY FOR PROFESSOR PARKER.
HE SPENT SO MUCH TIME WORKING ON THAT DEVICE.
- THE ICE CUBE TRANSMITTER?
- YES.
FOR THE LAST SIX MONTHS HE'S TESTED IT IN EVERY KNOWN FLUID.
THAT'S HOW HE GOT HIS REPUTATION.
- AS A PERFECTIONIST?
- NO, AS A DRUNK.
WATCH IT.
WATCH IT TAKE OFF.
- THE FLY, I KNOW.
- YEAH, OH, THERE HE GOES.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL, ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.
OH, ROUND AND ROUND HE GOES AND NOW A PERFECT LANDING.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE, PROFESSOR.
HOW DID YOU DO IT?
HOW DID I DO IT?
TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF NERVE-RACKING MICRO-MINIATURE FABRICATION AND $400,000 WORTH OF RESEARCH AND EQUIPMENT.
DID YOU SEE THOSE TWO TINY ANTENNA?
- MM-HMM.
- WELL, THE LEFT IS A RECEIVER; THE RIGHT, A TRANSMITTER.
NOTICE THE LEFT EYE-- THE WORLD'S SMALLEST RADAR TRACKING DISH.
- WOW.
- A NETWORK OF 7,000 EXQUISITELY DELICATE WAFER CIRCUITS.
THAT'S MARVELOUS.
UH, SORRY ABOUT YOUR ICE CUBE, PROFESSOR.
FORGET THE ICE CUBE, MAX, TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.
OH PLEASE, DON'T TELL THEM WHAT IT IS.
I WOULD LIKE MR.
SMART TO LOOK AT YOUR DESK AND SEE IF HE CAN DETECT WHICH ITEM IS THE LISTENING DEVICE.
PARKER, I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD DO THAT.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
IF HE CAN FOOL MY KEEN EYES, THE SECURITY OF KAOS IS DOOMED.
EXCUSE ME, 99.
NOW LET'S SEE.
WELL, I DON'T THINK IT'S THIS MAGAZINE.
IT'S A LITTLE OBVIOUS AND CLUMSY.
UH I DON'T THINK IT'S THIS PAPERWEIGHT OR THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER.
WHAT ABOUT THAT, UH-- THAT FLY?
HUH?
OH.
GOT IT.
LOOK, CHIEF, MAYBE THE PROFESSOR CAN BUILD ANOTHER FLY OR A MOSQUITO OR A LADYBUG OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH TIME.
MAX, YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PERSONALLY INFILTRATE KAOS.
THAT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.
YOU HEARD WHAT THEY SAID ON THE RECORDING.
- I'M TOO LOYAL, TOO DEDICATED.
- THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK OF YOU NOW.
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO GAMBLE AWAY YOUR NEXT SIX MONTHS' SALARY AND BECOME A STUMBLING, BUMBLING, DRUNKEN BUM.
- IS THAT AN ORDER, CHIEF?
- THAT'S AN ORDER.
I'LL SEE THAT WORD GETS OUT ON THE GRAPEVINE TONIGHT - THAT YOU'LL BE GAMBLING.
- WHERE, CHIEF?
THERE'S AN ILLEGAL GAMBLING CASINO THAT KAOS MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FREQUENT.
PHASE ONE.
HERE'S A COUPLE OF THOUSAND DOLLARS.
BET HEAVILY, LOSE IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY SEE YOU.
WELL, THAT SHOULDN'T BE TOO DIFFICULT, CHIEF.
OH, THERE'S ONE THING, MAX.
I'LL BE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS YOU'LL BE A DOUBLE AGENT.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
YOU MEAN WE CAN'T TELL 99?
MAX, KAOS WILL BE WATCHING YOUR FRIENDS CLOSELY.
YOU MUST CONVINCE THEM MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE THAT YOU'VE GONE BAD.
NOW, MAX, REMEMBER, ACTING AS A DOUBLE AGENT IS THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME IN THE WORLD.
THESE MEN ARE KILLERS.
THEY'LL STOP AT NOTHING.
YOU'LL BE LIVING IN CONSTANT DANGER EVERY MOMENT.
AND LOVING IT.
OUR INFORMATION WAS CORRECT.
MAXWELL SMART JUST ENTERED.
I GOT IT!
WHOO-HOO!
LOOK AT THAT PURDY GREEN LETTUCE ROLLING RIGHT ON BACK HOME.
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN BETTING AND THAT LITTLE OLD WAGON WHEEL FINALLY COME UP WITH IT.
WHOO-HOO!
YOU KNOW, MISTER, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT BEFORE YOU SHOWED UP I MUST HAVE LOST A COUPLE OF THOUSAND-BARREL OIL WELLS.
NOW YOU JUST STAY RIGHT HERE BECAUSE YOU AND ME ARE GONNA BUST THIS LITTLE GAME WIDE OPEN!
- WELL, THANK YOU, BUT I HAD OTHER PLANS.
- NO NO NO.
I AIN'T GONNA HOLD YOU, I AIN'T GONNA HOLD YOU.
WHY, YOU CAN'T HOLD BACK A BONA FIDE ANGEL OF LUCK, NOW CAN YOU?
HOLD ON, BOY, HOLD ON.
WHY, Y'ALL DIDN'T THINK I WAS GONNA LET YOU WALK AWAY UNREWARDED, NOW DID YOU, HUH?
- I CAN'T-- - AH-HH!
IF YOU DON'T, I JUST MIGHT GET VERY ANGRY.
- JACKS FULL.
- BEATS ME.
YEAH.
MIND IF I SIT IN?
TABLE STAKES.
THAT'S THE ONLY GAME I PLAY.
ANOTHER THOUSAND.
FRESH DECK, PLEASE.
I OPEN.
500.
- I CALL.
- I'M IN.
I CALL.
GIVE ME ONE.
TWO.
THREE.
I'LL TAKE FOUR.
- I'M OUT.
- I'M OUT.
I CALL YOUR 500 AND I RAISE YOU 500.
I SEE YOU.
WHAT DO YOU GOT?
WELL, GENTLEMEN, THAT CLEANS ME.
FOUR ACES, YOU WIN.
THAT BEATS ME.
WELL, GENTLEMEN, THAT'S ALL FOR ME.
I'M TOO LUCKY IN THIS GAME.
Dealer: HERE YOU GO, $4,000.
THANK YOU.
ARE YOU CERTAIN THE KAOS AGENT WAS WATCHING YOU?
EVERYBODY WAS WATCHING ME, CHIEF.
AND HE DIDN'T APPROACH YOU?
I'M TELLING YOU, CHIEF, NOBODY FROM KAOS IS GOING TO APPROACH ME.
I'VE GOT TOO GOOD A REPUTATION TO LIVE DOWN.
NOT ANYMORE, MAX.
WE'VE SHOWN THEM THAT YOU'RE A GAMBLER.
NOW WE MOVE INTO PHASE  PHYSICAL DEGRADATION.
YOU'LL BECOME AN ALCOHOLIC.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
- AN ALCOHOLIC?
- MM-HMM.
WELL, WILL THEY TAKE A HEAVY DRINKER?
MAX, TAKE GOOD CARE OF THIS.
THE TAILOR CHARGES A FORTUNE TO RIP IT UP LIKE THAT.
I GOT A DRY CLEANER THAT'LL DO THIS FOR NOTHING.
HERE, MAX, YOU'LL NEED SOME OF THESE.
OH, ASPIRIN, GOOD.
PROBABLY NEED A LOT OF ASPIRIN WITH ALL THAT DRINKING.
NO, MAX, NOT ASPIRIN.
THEY ARE ABSORBO PILLS.
KEEP ONE IN YOUR MOUTH WHILE YOU'RE DRINKING.
IT'LL ABSORB ALL THE ALCOHOL OUT OF THE LIQUOR.
SAY, THAT'S WONDERFUL, CHIEF.
THEN I'LL ACT DRUNK, I'LL LOOK DRUNK, I'LL EVEN SMELL DRUNK, BUT I'LL BE STONE SOBER.
THAT'S RIGHT, MAX.
NOT ONE DROP OF ALCOHOL WILL REACH YOUR STOMACH.
- UNLESS-- - UNLESS WHAT, CHIEF?
WELL, JUST DON'T SWALLOW ONE OF THE ABSORBO PILLS.
IF YOU DO, YOUR STOMACH FLUIDS WILL RELEASE THE ALCOHOL FROM THE PILL ALL AT ONCE.
I'LL REMEMBER THAT, CHIEF.
NOW YOU DO YOUR DRINKING IN CHEZ CHARLES-- THAT'S A SKID-ROW BAR.
WE'LL MAKE SURE KAOS GETS WIND OF WHERE YOU ARE.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
-  PUT THIS AWAY, WILL YOU?
COME IN.
THERE YOU ARE, MAX, I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.
UH, I-- I'VE BEEN BUSY.
OH, THAT'S OKAY.
COME ON, YOU'VE GOTTA GET HOME AND CHANGE - OR WE'LL BE LATE FOR THE CONCERT.
- THE CONCERT?
OH, TONIGHT'S SATURDAY NIGHT, THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S WHEN WE GO TO THE-- SORRY, 99, I CAN'T MAKE IT TONIGHT.
I'M BUSY.
OH YOU'RE ON ASSIGNMENT.
WELL, NOT EXACTLY.
YOU'RE ACTING VERY STRANGELY, MAX.
LOOK, 99, WHY DON'T YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT ME FOR A FEW DAYS?
MAX, I COULDN'T FORGET ABOUT YOU.
NOT EVEN FOR A FEW MINUTES.
- I'M SORRY, 99.
- IS IT ANOTHER GIRL, MAX?
- SORT OF.
- OH, OKAY, UM I GUESS, I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING THEN.
- GOOD NIGHT, CHIEF.
- GOOD NIGHT, 99.
MAX, UNTIL YOUR MISSION IS A SUCCESS, SHE'LL LEARN TO DO WITHOUT YOU.
YEAH, CHIEF, BUT WHAT IF MY MISSION IS A FAILURE?
WE'LL ALL LEARN TO DO WITHOUT YOU.
ALEX, HE'S HERE ALL RIGHT.
DRINKING LIKE IT'S GOING OUT OF STYLE.
THROAT LOZENGES, SORE THROAT.
OH.
- BARTENDER?
- YEAH.
- GIVE ME A B&B.
- B&B?
BOURBON AND BOURBON.
HEY, MAC, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET THAT DOG OUT OF HERE.
- WHAT DOG?
- THAT DOG.
FANG, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU WANT TO SPOIL EVERYTHING?
ALL RIGHT, DOGGY, GET OUT OF HERE.
GET LOST.
I DON'T WANT YOU HANGING AROUND ME.
CAN'T YOU SEE I'VE TURNED ROTTEN?
OKAY, IF YOU WANT THE TRUTH, YOU'RE NOT MY PAL ANYMORE.
I DON'T LIKE YOU.
YOU'VE GOT A SWEATY TONGUE.
AND DOGGY ODOR.
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.
NOW JUST GROWL YOURSELF RIGHT OUT THE DOOR.
GOOD WORK, FANG, YOU FOUND HIM.
MAX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS PLACE?
WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I'M DOING?
I'M GETTING DRUNK.
THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU, MAX.
"THAT'S NOT LIKE YOU, MAX".
OKAY, WHAT IS LIKE ME?
MAX!
WE'VE MEANT SO MUCH TO EACH OTHER.
LOOK, WILL YOU DO ME A FAVOR?
JUST LEAVE ME ALONE.
GET OUT OF MY LIFE.
MAX, I THINK I CAN HELP YOU.
IT'S THAT FLY, ISN'T IT, THE $400,000 ONE?
FILL HER UP, BARTENDER.
WE CAN WORK OUT SOMETHING.
I'VE SAVED A LITTLE MONEY.
LOOK, I DON'T WANT YOUR MONEY.
WE CAN PAY IT OFF $10 A WEEK.
$10 A WEEK?
YOU KNOW HOW LONG THAT WOULD TAKE?
SORRY, BUT I'VE GOT OTHER PLANS.
MAX, PLEASE LET ME TAKE YOU HOME.
LOOK, CAN'T YOU GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEAD?
I DON'T WANT TO GO HOME.
I LIKE IT HERE.
I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.
OKAY, THEN MAYBE YOU'LL BELIEVE THIS-- I'VE NEVER LIKED YOU, NOT EVEN FROM THE BEGINNING.
YOU'RE TOO STATUESQUE.
BESIDES, I DON'T LIKE THE THINGS YOU STAND  INTEGRITY, LOYALTY, DECENCY.
OKAY, MAX, I'M LEAVING.
BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU WANT ME TO.
I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED THAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE PRETENDING TO BE.
COME ON, FANG, COME ON.
SMART IS DETERIORATING RAPIDLY.
HE JUST DISMISSED HIS DOG AND HIS GIRL.
PARDON ME, I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO SOUND SILLY, BUT IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOUR SHOE IS RINGING?
MY SHOE?
YOU'VE BEEN DRINKING TOO MUCH OF THIS CHEAP BOOZE, SOLDIER.
LISTEN, I'M SORRY I TALKED TO YOU SO MEAN, BUT I CAN'T EXPLAIN NOW.
OH, CHIEF.
I THOUGHT IT WAS 99.
HAVE THEY MADE CONTACT WITH YOU YET?
NO, CHIEF, UH-- THEY'RE WATCHING ME VERY CLOSELY.
BUT I THINK THEY'RE FINDING IT HARD TO BELIEVE.
THAT MEANS WE'LL HAVE TO PUT PHASE THREE INTO EFFECT.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
-  CAN YOU HOLD ON A SECOND, CHIEF?
HELLO, UH, I'M SORRY, BUT I'M USING THE PHONE BOOTH.
COULD YOU CALL BACK LATER?
OKAY, CHIEF, PHASE THREE IT IS.
UH, CHIEF, JUST ONE THING WHAT IS PHASE THREE?
THAT'S WHERE I COME INTO THE BAR AND PICK A FIGHT WITH YOU, - AND YOU BEAT ME UP.
- BEAT YOU UP?
I COULDN'T DO THAT, CHIEF.
THERE'S NOTHING TO IT.
WE PLANTED A CASE OF WHISKEY IN HARMLESS BREAKAWAY BOTTLES DOWN THERE.
IT'S CALLED "OLD SOLDIER".
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS BREAK ONE OVER MY HEAD.
"OLD SOLDIER" OVER THE HEAD.
WELL, OKAY, CHIEF, IF YOU THINK IT'S NECESSARY.
BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW I WON'T BE ENJOYING IT.
SMART?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
A FEW ANSWERS.
SORRY, BUT I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA LIKE THE QUESTIONS.
WE'RE MISSING $68,000.
THAT'S TOUGH.
HAVE YOU LOOKED BEHIND THE SOFA CUSHIONS?
BESIDE MYSELF, YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO HAD ACCESS TO THE SAFE.
JUST WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT?
I'M MAKING A CITIZEN'S ARREST.
I DON'T THINK HE WAS LOOKING.
YOU'D BETTER HIT ME AGAIN.
BARTENDER, GIVE ME ANOTHER BOTTLE OF "OLD SOLDIER".
GIVE ME ANOTHER DRINK.
PUT A LITTLE MORE ICE.
HE MISSED IT AGAIN.
QUICK, GET ANOTHER BOTTLE.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF, I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.
WE'VE GOT TO GET HIS ATTENTION.
LET'S GO DOWN TO THE OTHER END OF THE BAR.
BARTENDER, GIVE ME A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE.
NOW LOOK, CHIEF, I'M GONNA TAKE THIS BOTTLE AND CRASH IT OVER THE END OF THE BAR.
THEN I'LL THREATEN YOU WITH THE JAGGED EDGES.
THAT'LL GET HIS ATTENTION.
ALL RIGHT, I'M TELLING YOU FOR THE LAST TIME, GET OUT OF HERE!
- IS HE LOOKING?
- HE MUST BE.
CHIEF?
YEAH?
I THINK I SWALLOWED MY ABSORBO PILL.
WHAT?
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, CHIEF?
THEY'RE NOT HALF BAD.
THEN WHAT HAPPENED?
HE HIT HIM WITH ANOTHER BOTTLE WHILE I WAS ORDERING A DRINK.
I HOPE HE HASN'T GOTTEN TOO VIOLENT FOR US TO USE.
WAKE HIM UP.
WAKE UP!
COME ON, WAKE UP.
- YOU'RE AMONG FRIENDS.
- NOW, MR.
SMART, I ALWAYS KNEW THAT DEEP DOWN INSIDE YOU WERE A RAT.
OH, THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONFIDENCE.
NO!
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LITTLE GIRLFRIEND FOLLOWED YOU HERE.
YEAH, WE CAUGHT HER SNOOPING AROUND OUTSIDE.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO WITH HER?
HOW ABOUT GIVING HER A SEVERE REPRIMAND?
SHE'LL HAVE TO BE DISPOSED OF.
UH, HOW ABOUT A STERN WARNING TO KEEP OFF THE PREMISES?
WHO'S GONNA DO IT?
WELL, I THINK IT'S ONLY JUST THAT MR.
SMART HAVE THAT HONOR.
WOULD YOU GO FOR A SEVERE REPRIMAND AND A STERN WARNING?
YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE VERY ANXIOUS TO CARRY OUT THIS ASSIGNMENT.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
I'M VERY ANXIOUS TO CARRY OUT THIS ASSIGNMENT.
IT'S JUST THAT I CAN'T WORK WITH A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING OVER MY SHOULDER.
AFTER ALL, EXECUTIONS ARE A KIND OF A PERSONAL THING WITH ME.
I THINK ALL OF YOU GENTLEMEN HAD BETTER LEAVE THE ROOM.
HOW LONG IS THIS GOING TO TAKE?
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN IT'S OVER.
OH, MAX, I KNEW YOU HADN'T TURNED ROTTEN.
YOU JUST HAD TO FIND OUT THE REST OF THEIR PLAN.
IT'S TOO LATE FOR THAT NOW.
I'VE GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA DO IT.
THERE'S ONLY ONE DOOR AND NO WINDOW.
- THAT'S IT!
- OF COURSE THAT'S IT.
- WHAT'S IT?
- THERE MUST BE A VENTILATOR.
LOOK!
MAX, THE NOISE!
THEY'LL GET SUSPICIOUS.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
WE NEED SOMETHING TO COVER IT.
- I KNOW.
- WHAT?
IF THEY HEAR SCREAMS, THEY'LL THINK I'M WORKING YOU OVER.
- RIGHT.
- I'D BETTER USE MY PHONO-WATCH.
OH.
GIVE ME THAT SCREAM RECORD FROM YOUR CHARM BRACELET.
HERE IT IS.
MUST BE THE FLIP SIDE.
Ah!
No!
No!
- THAT'S IT.
- GOOD.
-  - MAX, SOMEONE'S COMING.
WE'D BETTER TAKE THEM AT THE DOOR.
- WE'LL NEVER GET THROUGH THIS ANYWAY.
- RIGHT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
HEY!
NO!
NO NO NO NO, DON'T!
I'M NOT A KAOS AGENT!
- ARE YOU A DOUBLE AGENT?
-  YEAH.
- SO IS HE.
- 99, HE'S LYING.
- NO, I'M NOT!
- "THE GEESE FLY HIGH".
"THE FROST IS ON THE GRASS".
- MAX!
- HE IS.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, FELLA.
- OOH.
OOH.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO HIT YOU SO HARD.
- I THINK YOU FRACTURED MY SKULL.
- IT'LL HEAL, IT'LL HEAL.
OW!
DON'T SHOOT!
UH-- "THE GEESE FLY HIGH".
"THE FROST IS ON THE GRASS".
MAX!
- "THE GEESE FLY HIGH".
- "THE FROST IS ON THE GRASS".
"THE GEESE FLY--" UH!
All: "THE FROST IS ON THE GRASS".
JUST A MINUTE.
WHO ARE YOU GUYS?
C.I.A. NAVAL INTELLIGENCE.
F.B.I. SCOTLAND YARD, HERE.
YOU'RE-- SCOTLAND YARD?
YOU'RE BROWN?
I'M ADAM.
WELL, 99, I CAN'T WAIT TO TELL THE CHIEF ABOUT THIS.
WE'RE REALLY IN LINE FOR CONGRATULATIONS.
WE'VE JUST BROKEN THE SINISTER ARM OF KAOS THAT'S THREATENED THE NATION'S CAPITAL.
BUT, MAX, WHAT ABOUT WHEN THE CHIEF FINDS OUT THAT WE'VE JUST WOUNDED FOUR OF OUR OWN GOVERNMENT'S TOP AGENTS?
WELL, WE DON'T HAVE TO TELL THE CHIEF EVERYTHING.
APPARENTLY THE REAL KAOS MAN WHO STARTED THE GROUP DIED SEVERAL YEARS AGO, CHIEF, AND WAS NEVER REPLACED.
YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB, MAX, AND I UNDERSTAND MOST OF THEM WILL BE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL WITHIN THE MONTH.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
- ALL IN THE LINE OF WORK, MAX.
- WHAT ABOUT THE ELECTRONIC FLY?
OH, PARKER HAS COME UP WITH A NEW LISTENING DEVICE EVEN CLEVERER THAN THE FLY.
- ARE YOU READY, PARKER?
- YES, CHIEF.
SEE, IF YOU CAN PICK THIS ONE OUT, SMART.
AND PLEASE BE A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL THIS TIME.
- RIGHT, PROFESSOR.
- IT'S AMONG THESE OBJECTS ON THE DESK.
WELL, LET'S SEE.
IT'S NOT THE CIGARETTE LIGHTER, RIGHT?
RIGHT.
AND, UH IT'S NOT THE MAGAZINE, RIGHT?
CORRECT.
A FLY.
YOU'VE BUILT ANOTHER FLY.
NO, SMART, THAT'S A REAL FLY.
-  - OH.
ARE YOU SURE IT'S A FLY?
ABSOLUTELY.
WELL THEN I CAN KILL IT.
I HAVE A STRANGE FEELING IT'S THE LIGHT BULB.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
OH, BABY MUST BE HUNGRY.
- 86.
- 99.
THE CHIEF WANTS YOUR SURVEILLANCE REPORT.
RIGHT.
"8:40 THE CONSUL GENERAL ENTERED.
AT 9:12 A TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN WENT IN AND CAME OUT AGAIN AT 9:46.
NOTHING SUSPICIOUS THERE".
A TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN?
BUT, MAX, A PHONY TELEPHONE REPAIRMAN COULD HAVE ANYTHING HIDDEN IN HIS REPAIR KIT.
HE WAS CHECKED OUT BY SECURITY.
BELIEVE ME, 99, I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.
I KNOW, MAX, BUT SUPPOSING SOMEONE IS TRYING TO BLOW UP THIS CONSULATE?
WE DON'T KNOW THAT, 99.
ALL WE KNOW IS THE ANONYMOUS TIP SAID THAT THE CONSUL GENERAL'S LIFE WAS IN DANGER.
NOW IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'D LIKE TO GET ON WITH MY REPORT.
- SORRY, MAX.
- "AT 10:15, A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL ENTERED.
HE LEFT AT 11:22.
AT 12:06, A MAN DELIVERED A PAINTING AND CAME OUT JUST THREE MINUTES AGO".
- NOW GIVE ME YOUR PEN AND I'LL SIGN THE REPORT.
- RIGHT.
"12:09.
THE CONSULATE BLEW UP".
WHERE'D YOU FIND THIS?
IN THE WRECKAGE OF THE CONSULATE, CHIEF.
IT'S PART OF A PAINTING THAT WAS DELIVERED FROM AN ART GALLERY JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE EXPLOSION.
AN ART GALLERY OWNED BY A MAN NAMED REX SAVAGE?
RIGHT, CHIEF.
HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
PIECES OF PAINTINGS FROM THE SAVAGE GALLERY HAVE BEEN FOUND AT THE SCENE OF THE LAST TWO EXPLOSIONS.
- WHERE WERE THE OTHER TWO EXPLOSIONS, CHIEF?
- AN EMBASSY AND POLICE STATION.
- ANY CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM?
- ALL THREE PLACES HAD INFORMATION ON FILE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DETRIMENTAL TO KAOS.
THAT INFORMATION WAS DESTROYED IN EACH EXPLOSION.
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR INTELLIGENCE TO GIVE US A RUNDOWN ON REX SAVAGE.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
I'VE ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF THAT.
I'M HAVING THE INFORMATION TRANSFERRED HERE THROUGH OUR INTEROFFICE TOP SECRET RELAY.
-  - I THINK IT'S COMING THROUGH NOW, CHIEF.
I'LL GET IT.
THANK YOU, MAX.
THE INTELLIGENCE SECTION APPARENTLY HAS NO FILE ON SAVAGE-- NO PICTURE, NO FINGERPRINTS, NOTHING.
THAT CAN'T BE RIGHT, CHIEF.
WELL, EITHER OUR BOYS ARE LYING DOWN ON THE JOB OR THIS ROCK IS A FORGERY.
NO, THAT'S THE OFFICIAL CONTROL ROCK, MAX.
- LOOK.
- OH, YES.
OUR NAME AND ADDRESS IS ON IT.
"IF FOUND, DROP IN ANY MAILBOX".
I WANT SAVAGE'S FINGERPRINTS AND A PICTURE TAKEN OF HIM RIGHT AWAY.
OF A WEALTHY SOCIETY GIRL.
- A PATRON OF THE ARTS, RIGHT?
- CORRECT.
MAKE CONTACT WITH HIM AND USE THIS PENCIL.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
WON'T IT LOOK A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS IF SHE STARTS DRAWING HIS PICTURE?
IT'S FOR HIS FINGERPRINTS, MAX.
THIS PENCIL HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY TREATED.
IF YOU CAN GET HIM TO TOUCH IT WITH HIS FINGERS IT WILL LEAVE AN IMPRESSION OF HIS PRINTS.
RIGHT.
WHAT ABOUT ME, CHIEF?
YOU CAN POSE AS HER CHAUFFEUR.
- OH, THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
- THANK YOU.
AND HAVE PARKER HIDE A MICROCAMERA SOMEWHERE IN YOUR UNIFORM SO YOU CAN TAKE SAVAGE'S PICTURE.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
COME ON, 99.
- OKAY.
OH, MAX, WAIT A MINUTE.
THAT ROCK GOES BACK TO MESSAGE CENTER.
OH.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
HERE YOU ARE, MY DEAR.
- A LITTLE GIFT FOR YOU.
- THANK YOU, REX.
- SEE YOU SOON?
- OF COURSE.
- GOODBYE.
- GOODBYE.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THROUGH WITH THAT GRETA COVAC.
HER CONSULATE HAS ALREADY BEEN BLOWN UP.
SHE CAME IN AND STARTED ASKING QUESTIONS.
SHE MUST BE ELIMINATED.
SHE WILL, MONDO.
I JUST GAVE HER ONE OF OUR INGENIOUS WORKS OF ART WITH THE TIME EXPLOSIVE PAINT.
IN FIVE MINUTES, THERE WON'T BE A TRACE OF HER.
WHAT A COMBINATION OF TALENTS-- HERE AM I, ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREATEST ARTISTS, AND YOU, ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST INGENIOUS CHEMISTS.
AND AFTER OUR NEXT PAINTING IS DELIVERED, THE WHOLE WORLD WILL HEAR OF US.
WHERE WILL IT HANG?
IN THE PENTAGON.
I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND MODERN ART, MAX.
WHAT DO THESE PAINTINGS MEAN?
IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE.
- LET'S TAKE THIS PAINTING OVER HERE AS AN EXAMPLE.
- OKAY.
NOW LET ME SEE I THINK THIS IS A STREET SCENE.
YOU SEE, THE BUILDINGS IN THE BACKGROUND SYMBOLIZE THE VAST FORCES OF NATURE; AND THE LONELINESS, INSIGNIFICANCE AND CONSTANT STRUGGLE OF MAN IS REPRESENTED BY THAT LITTLE BLACK DOT.
MAX, LOOK AT THAT MODERN SCULPTURE.
IT'S MADE OUT OF A DENTED HUBCAP, RUSTY FENDER, TIN CANS, NUTS AND BOLTS AND A BICYCLE CHAIN.
YES, HE'S GIVEN US MAN'S ETERNAL STRUGGLE AGAINST THE UNIVERSE OUT OF A PILE OF JUNK.
WHAT'S IT CALLED?
"A PILE OF JUNK".
MONDO, IT'S 8:00.
WE'LL CLOSE THE GALLERY AS SOON AS THESE PEOPLE LEAVE.
YES, MR.
SAVAGE.
MAX, THAT'S SAVAGE.
IS YOUR CAMERA READY?
I'LL CHECK.
NOW ALL I HAVE TO DO IS GET HIS FACE IN FRONT OF THIS LENS AND THEN PRESS THIS BUTTON - AND I'VE GOT HIS PICTURE.
- RIGHT.
I'LL GET HIS FINGERPRINTS ON THE SPECIAL PENCIL.
GOOD EVENING.
I'D BE HONORED TO OFFER MY ASSISTANCE TO SOMEONE SO ATTRACTIVE.
WELL, THANK YOU, BUT IT'S THE LADY WHO'S INTERESTED IN BUYING A PAINTING.
YES, I, UM-- - OH, MY.
- AH!
I'LL GET IT.
- THERE WE ARE.
- THANK YOU, MAXWELL.
WHAT STYLE OF PAINTING DO YOU FEEL MOST AT HOME WITH, MISS?
WESTBROOK.
MELISSA WESTBROOK.
OH, I LIKE MANY DIFFERENT STYLES.
MY OWN COLLECTION IS VARIED.
- OH, I-- - I'LL GET IT.
AFTER YOU, SIR.
HERE YOU ARE.
WOULD THE MODERN TECHNIQUE OF PAINTING APPEAL TO YOU?
OH, YES, IT DOES VERY MUCH IN THE HANDS OF THE PROPER ARTIST OF COURSE.
WELL, WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL SELECTION.
IN THAT CORNER, WE HAVE SOME RATHER INTERESTING EXAMPLES - OF IMPRESSIONIST PAINTING.
- HMM.
AND OVER ON THAT WALL ARE SOME OF OUR BETTER NON-OBJECTIVE WORKS.
AND OF COURSE AS YOU CAN SEE THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF CUBISTIC, - SURREALIST AND EVEN THE NATURALISTIC TECHNIQUES.
- UH-HUH.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOUR CHAUFFEUR?
UM, MAXWELL'S A LIP READER.
Mondo: MR.
SAVAGE?
JUST A MOMENT.
- EXCUSE ME.
- OF COURSE.
- MISSED.
- SET IT UP AGAIN, MAX.
OH, THAT'S A SHAME ABOUT THE PENCIL.
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THAT THE CHIEF WOULD GO FOR A NICE GOOD CLEAN SET OF GLOVE PRINTS, DO YOU?
WAIT A MINUTE.
IF I COULD JUST GET HIM ALONE.
RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ALONE?
HE CAN'T KEEP HIS GLOVES ON FOREVER.
I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD BE ALONE WITH HIM.
MAX, YOU SOUND LIKE YOU'RE JEALOUS.
PFFT.
JEALOUS.
NOW THAT'S RIDICULOUS, 99.
IT'S JUST THAT THAT MAN MIGHT TURN OUT TO BE A DANGEROUS KISSER-- UH, KILLER.
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE TWO, SOMETHING PECULIAR.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
I'M SURE I'VE SEEN THAT MAN BEFORE.
GET HIS PICTURE AND WE'LL CHECK IT THROUGH KAOS HEADQUARTERS.
I'LL KEEP THE GIRL BUSY.
- OH, MISS WESTBROOK?
- YES, MR.
SAVAGE?
PLEASE CALL ME REX.
THANK YOU.
PLEASE CALL ME MELISSA.
MELISSA, TAKE A LOOK AT THESE.
- WELL, SIR.
- JUST CALL ME MAXWELL.
MAXWELL.
THERE'S A PAINTING OVER HERE I THINK YOU OUGHT TO SEE.
- I'D LOVE TO.
- IT'S JUST OVER HERE.
I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THE FINEST EXAMPLES OF REALISTIC PAINTING THAT WE HAVE EVER HAD.
- WHAT IS IT CALLED?
- "THE CAMERA".
HOW PROVOCATIVE.
IF YOU LOOK A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY YOU'LL SEE THAT THE PAINTER HAS INCLUDED EVERY DETAIL.
MARVELOUS WORK, DON'T YOU THINK?
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I CAN SHOW YOU?
YES, HOW ABOUT SOME COLD COMPRESSES FOR MY EYES?
FUNNIEST-LOOKING PAINTING I'VE EVER SEEN.
UH, MISS WESTBROOK, ARE YOU READY TO LEAVE NOW?
MR.
SAVAGE IS GOING TO DRIVE ME HOME, MAXWELL.
- YOU CAN GO ON AHEAD.
- WHAT ABOUT ME?
I MEAN, WHY CAN'T I DRIVE THE TWO OF YOU?
TWO'S COMPANY.
THREE'S A CROWD.
MAYBE I COULD GET A FRIEND.
- JUST THE TWO OF US.
- THAT'LL BE ALL, MAXWELL.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL EVENING.
I THOUGHT PERHAPS WE MIGHT TAKE A DRIVE THROUGH THE PARK.
OH, MR.
SAVAGE?
YES?
HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX.
I'M IN LOVER'S LANE.
LISTEN, CHIEF, BEFORE I FILL YOU IN, I WANT YOU TO GIVE A MESSAGE TO PARKER AT THE LAB.
TELL HIM THAT THERE ARE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED ON THE STEERING WHEEL PHONE.
EVERY TIME I TURN THE CORNER, I DIAL THE OPERATOR.
NEVER MIND THAT, MAX.
JUST GIVE ME YOUR REPORT.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
99 IS IN THE CAR WITH SAVAGE.
SHE'S STILL TRYING TO GET HIS FINGERPRINTS.
I THINK HE'S BEGINNING TO HELP HER.
I HOPE YOU'RE NOT IN LOVER'S LANE BY YOURSELF.
IT COULD DRAW ATTENTION TO YOU.
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
I HAVE MY INFLATE-O-GIRL WITH ME.
- OKAY, MAX.
- I'LL CHECK IN LATER.
THIS MOONLIGHT IS MADE-TO-ORDER.
MMM.
IT'S JUST PERFECT.
DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
WHAT?
YOUR GLOVE IS SCRATCHING MY CHEEK.
WOULD YOU MIND TERRIBLY JUST, UH-- WHY, OF COURSE NOT, MY DEAR.
I'M SORRY.
OH, IT'S NOTHING REALLY.
IS THAT BETTER?
JUST LOVELY, THANK YOU.
ALL RIGHT, FELLA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP HERE?
ACTUALLY, NOTHING, OFFICER.
WE'RE JUST SITTING HERE LOOKING AT THE TREES.
NOW WHAT ABOUT THAT DUMMY?
WELL, THIS IS LOVER'S LANE, ISN'T IT?
I'D LOOK PRETTY PECULIAR SITTING UP HERE BY MYSELF.
WHAT KIND OF A WEIRDO ARE YOU?
OH, I DON'T KNOW, JUST A PLAIN, NORMAL, EVERYDAY WEIRDO, I GUESS.
I THINK YOU'D BETTER TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE DOING UP HERE.
WELL, I CAN EXPLAIN, OFFICER.
YOU SEE, I NEEDED A GIRL, AND I CARRY THIS ONE IN MY TRUNK.
LET ME PUT IT THIS WAY.
THIS ISN'T REALLY MY GIRL.
I JUST USE HER FOR EMERGENCIES.
YOU SEE, OFFICER, I'M A SECRET-- WELL, I'D BETTER NOT REVEAL MY IDENTITY.
OFFICER, DO YOU KNOW WHERE I COULD GET A FLAT FIXED?
MAX, I TOLD YOU TO BE CAREFUL AND NOT CALL ATTENTION TO YOURSELF.
BUT I WASN'T DOING ANYTHING WRONG, CHIEF.
I WAS JUST SITTING IN MY CHAUFFEUR'S UNIFORM WITH MY RUBBER DUMMY.
SO WHAT DID THE POLICE CHARGE YOU WITH?
VIOLATING SECTION 387 OF THE PENAL CODE.
WHICH IS?
SITTING IN A CHAUFFEUR'S UNIFORM NEXT TO A RUBBER DUMMY.
OH, YES, THEY'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET THAT LAW REPEALED FOR SEVERAL YEARS.
WHO HAS?
THE RUBBER DUMMY LOBBY.
WELL, THANKS FOR BAILING ME OUT ANYWAY, CHIEF.
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAX.
NOW WHAT ABOUT SAVAGE'S PHOTOGRAPHS?
WELL, I COULDN'T GET ANY PICTURES OF HIM.
YOU WHAT?
I'M SORRY, CHIEF.
BUT I'VE GOT SOME BEAUTS OF MYSELF.
WHAT ABOUT SAVAGE'S FINGERPRINTS?
OH.
WELL, YOU KNOW, CHIEF, HE WEARS GLOVES AND HE NEVER TAKES THOSE GLOVES OFF FOR A MINUTE.
THIS IS FANTASTIC.
HERE WE ARE, ONE OF THE BEST-KNOWN SECRET ORGANIZATIONS IN THE COUNTRY, AND WE CAN'T EVEN GET A SIMPLE LITTLE SET OF FINGERPRINTS.
CHIEF, I'VE JUST MADE A DATE WITH REX SAVAGE.
HE'S COMING TO MY APARTMENT FOR AN INTIMATE SUPPER.
YOU DID WHAT?
DID YOU HEAR THAT, CHIEF?
AN INTIMATE SUPPER DATE WITH THAT POTENTIAL KILLER.
GOOD WORK, 99.
GOOD WORK, 99.
I NEW YOU'D LIKE OUR PLAN, CHIEF.
NOW APPARENTLY THERE ARE ONLY TWO OCCASIONS WHEN REX TAKES HIS GLOVES OFF.
ONE IS WHEN HE EATS AND THE OTHER IS WHEN HE BATHES.
HE'S COMING UP TO MY PLACE ABOUT 11:00.
ISN'T THAT A LITTLE LATE FOR A BATH?
MAX, IT'S AN INTIMATE SUPPER.
EXCELLENT.
LISTEN, CHIEF.
WHY DON'T THEY COME TO MY APARTMENT?
I COULD ACT AS THE BUTLER AND KEEP MY EYE ON SAVAGE.
GOOD IDEA.
YOUR APARTMENT IS LARGER.
IT'S MORE THE KIND OF PLACE THAT MELISSA WESTPORT MIGHT LIVE IN.
THIS MAY BE OUR CHANCE TO GET A FULL DOSSIER ON SAVAGE.
- LET'S GO DOWN TO THE LAB.
- RIGHT.
THIS TABLEWARE IS SPECIALLY RIGGED.
WHEN THIS SUBJECT SITS DOWN TO HIS MEAL, THE FOLLOWING THINGS WILL  THIS CHEMICALLY TREATED SOUP SPOON WILL TRIGGER A CAMERA BUILT INTO THE BOTTOM OF A SOUP PLATE.
EVERY TIME I TAKE A SPOONFUL OF SOUP, THE PLATE TAKES MY PICTURE.
WATCH.
WHAT ABOUT THE FLASH?
WON'T HE SEE THE FLASH?
AH, IT WILL BE ABSORBED BY THE SOUP.
AND YOU'LL HAVE TO REMOVE THE SOUP PLATE - BEFORE HE GETS TO THE BOTTOM.
- RIGHT.
AND THIS ROLL IS MADE OUT OF A SPECIAL COMPOSITE.
WHEN THE SUBJECT TAKES IT, IT WILL MAKE A PERFECT IMPRESSION OF ALL OF HIS FINGERPRINTS, WHICH MEANS YOU'LL HAVE TO GET IT AWAY FROM HIM BEFORE HE EATS IT.
OR USE ANOTHER ROLL.
VERY GOOD, PARKER.
- ANYTHING ELSE, PROFESSOR?
- ONE MORE DEVICE.
THIS BOWL OF FRUIT WILL GIVE US A SAMPLE OF THE SUBJECT'S SPEAKING VOICE.
THERE IS A TAPE RECORDER BUILT INTO THIS APPLE.
Max: THAT'S FANTASTIC, PROFESSOR.
BUT WHERE'S THE MICROPHONE?
OH, THE MICROPHONE, IT'S RIGHT IN H-- IN YOUR STOMACH.
THANK YOU.
- TO YOU.
- TO US.
- LISTEN - HMM.
EVER SINCE I MET YOU, THERE IS ONLY ONE THING THAT I'M ABLE TO THINK ABOUT.
WHAT'S THAT, REX?
FIVE MINUTES TO DINNER.
I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO BE ALONE TONIGHT.
OH, MAXWELL?
HE'S JUST HERE TO SERVE SUPPER.
AFTER THAT, I ASSURE YOU, WE'LL BE QUITE ALONE.
I HOPE THAT THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF MANY MIDNIGHT SUPPERS, MY DEAR.
SO DO I, REX.
- AS I WAS SAYING - HMM.
THE ONLY THING THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO THINK ABOUT ALL DAY IS COME AND GET IT!
MAXWELL.
WELL I GUESS WE HAD BETTER GO EAT SUPPER.
OH, COME ON, REX.
DON'T LET MAXWELL BOTHER YOU.
ACTUALLY, HE'S BEEN IN THE FAMILY FOR YEARS AND I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM.
MAY I SUGGEST THE RACK?
THANK YOU, MAXWELL.
YOU'RE WELCOME, 99.
WHAT DID HE CALL YOU?
HE SAID, "NIGHTY-NIGHT".
IT'S A LITTLE GAME WE USED TO PLAY AS CHILDREN.
NIGHTY-NIGHT, MAXWELL.
TRY THE SOUP, REX.
I THINK YOU'LL LIKE IT.
- WHAT KIND IS IT?
- CREAM OF TECHNICOLOR.
MMM.
VERY GOOD.
VERY.
I WASN'T FINISHED.
WE DON'T WANT THE SOUP TO GET COLD, SIR.
HERE, WHY DON'T YOU TRY A ROLL?
THANK YOU.
- WHO COULD THAT BE?
- I'LL GET IT, MA'AM.
IN THE MEANTIME, WHY DON'T YOU TWO JUST TALK AMONGST YOURSELVES?
AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO SPEAK UP.
UH, MAXWELL, TELL WHOMEVER'S AT THE DOOR TO COME BACK TOMORROW.
YES, MA'AM.
I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND COMING BACK TOMORROW.
SOME PEOPLE JUST CAN'T STAND REJECTION.
STAND BACK AND KEEP YOUR HANDS UP.
MONDO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
YOU'VE BEEN TRICKED, SAVAGE.
THIS MAN IS NO BUTLER.
YOU'RE TELLING ME.
WE'VE GOT A REPORT ON HIS PHOTOGRAPH FROM KAOS HEADQUARTERS.
HE'S MAXWELL SMART, AN AGENT FOR CONTROL.
MAX, HERE!
GOOD THROW, 99.
GOOD CATCH, MONDO!
YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS, SAVAGE.
OH?
WHY, MR.
SMART?
BECAUSE AT THIS VERY MINUTE ARE CONVERGING ON THIS BUILDING WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE TWO SQUAD CARS AND A MOTORCYCLE COP?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT A VICIOUS STREET CLEANER AND A TOOTHLESS POLICE DOG?
IF YOU WERE EXPECTING HELP, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE ALREADY.
NOW, MY DEAR MELISSA, YOU ARE GOING TO PAINT MR.
SMART TO DEATH.
YES, THIS CAN CONTAINS EXPLOSIVE PAINT WITH A TIMING DEVICE MIXED IN.
THIS PAINT CONTAINS A VIBRATION EXPLOSIVE.
IT DETONATES THE MOMENT A WINDOW OR A DOOR IS SLAMMED.
AND THIS CAN CONTAINS NITRO FLOOR PAINT.
IT EXPLODES THE INSTANT ANYONE STEPS ON IT.
NOW YOU START PAINTING MR.
SMART WITH THE TIME EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE.
- NITRO FLOOR PAINT.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE FALSE MOVE AND YOU'LL BE BLOWN TO KINGDOM COME.
COME ON, MAX.
GOOD WORK, 99.
WELL, WE'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
THEY THINK JUST BECAUSE WE'RE ON THE SIDE OF GOOD THAT WE'RE SOFT, BUT WHAT THEY DON'T KNOW IS THAT WE'RE TOUGH AND HARD AND DO A VERY NICE JOB.
THAT'S WHY THEY ARE TRAPPED IN THIS ROOM AND CAN'T GET OUT.
COME ON, 99.
WAIT A MINUTE, DON'T MOVE.
YOU'RE IN THE SAME POSITION AS WE ARE.
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THIS ROOM EITHER.
IF YOU TAKE ONE STEP, WE'LL ALL BE BLOWN TO BITS.
THAT'S RIGHT.
GOT ANY IDEAS, MAX?
WELL, WHY DON'T WE ALL JOIN IN A BIG CHORUS OF "HELP"?
- All: HELP!
- Max: SHH.
THE VIBRATION PAINT.
HELP!
HELP!
WELL, THAT FINISHES UP THE APARTMENT, 99.
A NICE, FRESH PAINT JOB.
YOU DID A BEAUTIFUL JOB, MAX.
OH, THANK YOU, 99.
YOU KNOW, WHEN THE CHIEF RESCUED US AND I SAW ALL THESE CANS OF PAINT LAYING AROUND SAVAGE'S ART GALLERY, - I FIGURED I MIGHT AS WELL PUT THEM TO GOOD USE.
- HMM.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU SAY WE GO DOWN TO THE DINER AND I BUY YOU A CUP OF COFFEE WHILE THE PAINT DRIES?
LOVELY.
MAX, ARE YOU SURE THIS PAINT'S ALL RIGHT?
OF COURSE IT IS.
I CHECKED EVERY CAN OF PAINT IN THE GALLERY AND MEMORIZED THE NON-EXPLOSIVE ONES.
COME ON.
MAX DON'T WORRY, 99.
I COVERED THE FURNITURE.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
WONDER WHAT'S KEEPING AGENT 46.
I DON'T KNOW.
HE'S LONG OVERDUE.
THE MESSAGE IN THE DROP SAID TO BRING $2,000 TO THIS BUS STATION AT 11:00 SHARP.
MAX, THERE'S 46.
HE'S USING THE SILENT SIGNAL SYSTEM.
- RIGHT.
I'VE GOT MY BOOK RIGHT HERE.
- GOOD.
NOW LET'S SEE TOUCHED HIS BRIM, RUBBED HIS LEFT ARM, AND HITCHED UP HIS PANTS.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
HE WANTS ME TO STEAL SECOND BASE.
MAX, THAT'S THE SPY BASEBALL HANDBOOK.
OH, RIGHT.
I'VE GOT THE OTHER BOOK RIGHT HERE.
AH, HERE IT IS.
THE SIGNAL SAYS, "I THINK I'M BEING FOLLOWED.
BLUE ALERT.
ACT CASUAL AND DO NOT TRY TO CONTACT ME UNTIL MY NEXT SIGNAL".
MAX, WAS HIS NEXT SIGNAL SUPPOSED TO BE A GROAN?
NO.
MAX, LOOK!
- MAX, IS HE?
- YES.
LOOK, 99.
HE TRIED TO SCRAWL A MESSAGE IN THE WET CEMENT.
BETTER CALL THE CHIEF AND GET MEN DOWN HERE RIGHT AWAY.
- WE'LL NEED HELP.
THIS ISN'T GONNA BE EASY.
- FINDING THE KILLER?
NO, GETTING THIS BLOCK OF CEMENT BACK TO CONTROL.
STRYKER, HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU NEVER BOTHER ME WHEN I'M IN A BIG-MONEY GAME?
THAT'S IT, FITZBURG.
LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU.
NEVER TRY TO HUSTLE THE SHARK.
OKAY, FOLKS, CLOSING TIME.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
REMEMBER, THE FAMILY THAT PLAYS TOGETHER STAYS TOGETHER.
- I TOOK CARE OF THAT CONTROL AGENT.
- GOOD.
BUT HE WAS MEETING ANOTHER AGENT WHO I RECOGNIZED-- MAXWELL SMART.
- WELL, I'VE NEVER COME ACROSS HIM.
- YOU NEVER WILL.
I'M GOING BACK TO THAT BUS STATION, PICK UP HIS TRAIL, AND WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT, I'LL KILL HIM.
-  - Shark: THERE'S THE SIGNAL.
WE'VE INTERCEPTED ANOTHER MESSAGE FROM CONTROL.
I'LL GET IT OUT OF THE MACHINE.
GET THE DRAPES.
AH.
FIVE LEFT, THEN EIGHT.
I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU, SHARK, NOBODY WOULD EVER FIGURE THE MACHINE WAS IN THERE.
WOULDN'T DO 'EM ANY GOOD IF THEY DID.
IF ANYBODY TRIED TO OPEN IT WITHOUT THE PROPER COMBINATION, THEY'D BE BLASTED SKY-HIGH.
I WONDER WHAT AGENT 46 WANTED WITH THIS $2,000.
I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THIS MESSAGE IN THE CEMENT WILL TELL US.
HE WAS WORKING UNDERCOVER, LOOKING FOR A NEW ELECTRONIC BRAIN THAT KAOS HAD SET UP.
- AN ELECTRONIC BRAIN?
- YES, A MACHINE THAT THEY'VE BEEN USING TO INTERCEPT AND DECODE OUR SECRET MESSAGES.
HMM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE IT'S LOCATED?
ACCORDING TO OUR EXPERTS, IT MUST BE SOMEWHERE NEAR CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.
AND BECAUSE OF ITS MECHANICAL COMPLEXITY, IT'S GOT TO BE LARGE AND HEAVY.
- THEN IT CAN'T BE MOVED.
- RIGHT.
OH, THERE YOU ARE, CHIEF.
IF YOU'RE READY, LET'S ANALYZE THAT MESSAGE AGENT 46 WAS TRYING TO WRITE, HMM?
- GO AHEAD, PARKER.
- WE'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE SHORTHAND WRITING HE LEARNED IN TRAINING SCHOOL, AND ITS PURPOSE.
IT'S A SECRET SCRAWL TO BE USED BY WOUNDED SPIES WHO WANT TO LEAVE US A MESSAGE OR A CLUE BEFORE THEY DIE.
THE TRANSLATION'S HERE ON THIS CHART-- "THE DEAD SPY SCRAWLS".
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS MATCH THE SYMBOLS ON THE CEMENT WITH THE SYMBOLS ON THE CHART.
NOW, LET'S SEE.
UH, LET'S SEE.
THIS MATCHES THE SIXTH BOX IN THE THIRD ROW.
- THAT'S THE LETTER "P".
- AND THE NEXT SYMBOL MATCHES THE ONE IN THE FOURTH BOX IN THE SECOND ROW.
THAT'S THE LETTER "I".
P-I.
- P-I - I THINK I'VE GOT IT, CHIEF.
IT'S REALLY QUITE SIMPLE, PARKER.
YOU SEE, THE ELECTRONIC BRAIN IS LOCATED SOMEWHERE IN THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.
- WRONG.
- WRONG.
- PAID INFORMER.
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT.
- THE OTHER SYMBOL STANDS FOR A WASHINGTON TELEPHONE NUMBER.
THAT'S WHY AGENT 46 WANTED THE MONEY.
THIS INFORMER MUST HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT KAOS'S ELECTRONIC BRAIN.
- FOLLOW THIS UP, MAX.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- YEAH?
- THIS IS MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86, OF CONTROL.
DID YOU TRY TO CONTACT ONE OF OUR AGENTS TONIGHT AND SELL HIM SOME INFORMATION ABOUT A DECODING MACHINE?
- COULD BE.
YOU INTERESTED?
- Yes.
BE AT THE SAME BUS STATION TOMORROW NIGHT AT 10:00.
HAVE THE 2,000 BUCKS WITH YOU.
- WELL, HOW WILL I KNOW YOU?
- YOU WON'T.
THE OTHER AGENT WAS KNOCKED OFF, AND I'M NOT TAKING ANY CHANCES.
YOU WEAR A RED CARNATION, AND I'LL CONTACT YOU NEAR THE NEWSSTAND.
Right.
YOU GONNA STAND THERE ALL NIGHT OR ARE YOU GONNA BUY SOMETHIN'?
THAT'S WHAT I'M HERE FOR.
I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO NOTICE THE CARNATION.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.
HOW DO WE HANDLE THIS?
JUST LIKE IT'S ALWAYS BEEN HANDLED.
I HAND YOU THE MERCHANDISE, YOU GIVE ME THE MONEY.
YES, THIS IS A PERFECT FRONT.
UH, WHAT'LL I BUY?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
NEWSPAPER?
KEYCHAIN?
HOW ABOUT GUM?
VERY CLEVER.
WHERE IS IT?
WHERE WOULD IT BE?
- IN THE WRAPPER.
- NOW, LISTEN.
I CAN'T AFFORD TO TAKE ANY CHANCES.
I GIVE YOU 500 NOW, AND THE REST WHEN I SEE IF THE GUM IS THERE.
OH, THE GUM IS THERE, ALL RIGHT.
WAIT, THERE'S NOTHING BUT GUM IN HERE.
THAT MAN'S MADE A TERRIBLE MISTAKE.
HE'S NOT THE INFORMER.
OKAY.
READY TO SELL.
- MAKE IT SNAPPY.
WHERE'S THE MONEY?
- NOW, JUST A MINUTE.
ONE MISTAKE HAS BEEN MADE ALREADY.
I'M NOT PAYING ANOTHER RED CENT UNTIL I HAVE DEFINITE PROOF THAT YOU'RE THE REAL INFORMER.
NOW, WAIT A MINUTE   THE BRAIN.
WHERE IS THE BRAIN?
SHARK POOL M-MOTHER.
HELLO, THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
COME IN, CONTROL.
HELLO, CHIEF?
MAX.
THE INFORMER'S JUST BEEN KILLED, BUT HE LEFT US A CLUE.
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY A CENT FOR IT.
NO, I DON'T HAVE THE ENTIRE $2,000.
I HAVE 1500 OF IT.
WELL, OF COURSE I DIDN'T LOSE IT, CHIEF.
WHAT DO YOU THINK I AM, STUPID?
I SPENT THE OTHER 500 FOR A PACKAGE OF GUM.
"SHARK, POOL, MOTHER".
"SHARK, POOL, M--" WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
I THINK I'VE GOT A LEAD.
WELL, I HOPE SO, MAX.
WE'VE BEEN AT IT FOR HOURS.
NOW, LOOK.
"SHARK" IS A FISH, AND "POOL" IS A BODY OF WATER, AND "MOTHER" IS A LADY PARENT.
"FISH, WATER, PARENT".
NOW, IF WE CAN JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT MEANS, WE'VE GOT IT.
I THINK WE'D BETTER GO BACK TO "SHARK, POOL, MOTHER".
WAIT A MINUTE.
MY HOBBY IS PLAYING POOL, AND I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING.
LOOK, CHIEF, THIS IS NO TIME TO PLAY POOL.
WE'RE WORKING ON A CASE.
ONE OF THE BEST POOL PLAYERS IN TOWN IS A MAN KNOWN AS THE SHARK, AND HE RUNS A PLACE CALLED "MOTHER'S FAMILY POOL PARLOR".
JUST WHAT ARE YOU SAYING, CHIEF?
WELL, IF THE SHARK IS A KAOS MAN, IT'S JUST POSSIBLE THAT THE DECODING MACHINE COULD BE HIDDEN IN MOTHER'S FAMILY POOL PARLOR.
THEN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT IF THE SHARK IS A KAOS MAN, THEN THE DECODING MACHINE-- MAX!
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.
WE'LL NEED SOMEONE TO KEEP THE SHARK OCCUPIED LONG ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER AGENT TO SEARCH FOR IT.
A MAN LIKE THE SHARK COULD NEVER RESIST THE CHALLENGE OF A GAME WITH A GOOD POOL PLAYER.
WELL, I'M YOUR MAN, CHIEF.
THIS IS MY ASSIGNMENT.
MAX, THIS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS.
YOU'D BE ON THE SPOT, WALKING A TIGHTROPE, POSSIBLY FACING A VIOLENT DEATH.
AND LOVING IT.
ALL RIGHT, MAX, IF YOU INSIST.
FOR THE DECODING MACHINE.
BY THE WAY, HOW'S YOUR POOL?
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, CHIEF.
I KNOW THE GAME INSIDE AND OUT.
I WAS AFRAID YOU'D SAY THAT.
EVERYTHING IS ORGANIZED AND READY TO GO, MAX.
PARKER IS WORKING ON SOME SPECIAL EQUIPMENT FOR YOU, AND WE'VE SENT FOR THE ARCHITECT'S BLUEPRINTS OF THE POOLROOM TO SEE WHERE THE MACHINE MIGHT BE HIDDEN.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, CHIEF.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF MY END.
THIS IS WILLIE MARCONI, ONE OF THE BEST POOL EXPERTS IN THE COUNTRY.
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
I WANT YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN TEACH HIM HOW TO PLAY A GOOD GAME, WILLIE.
I CAN TEACH ANYONE.
THE CHIEF HAS GOT IT A LITTLE WRONG, WILLIE.
YOU SEE, I HAPPEN TO BE AN EXPERT AT THIS GAME.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I HAPPEN TO BE THE POOL CHAMPION OF THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
THE ENTIRE EAST COAST.
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THE WEST COAST?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT STEUBENVILLE, OHIO?
DO YOU USE POWDER?
NO, I'VE ALWAYS FOUND IT A LITTLE EFFEMINATE.
FOR YOUR HANDS, TO CUT DOWN ON THE FRICTION.
LET THE POOL CUE SLIDE EASILY THROUGH YOUR FINGERS, LIKE THIS.
OH, THAT KIND OF POWDER.
OF COURSE I USE IT.
WELL, WILLIE, HOW'S IT GOING?
WELL, KEEP TRYING.
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET A GAME STARTED.
- RIGHT.
I HAVE A COUPLE OF SHOTS THAT'LL KNOCK YOUR EYE OUT.
I'LL BET YOU HAVE.
THAT IS THE CUE BALL.
NOW YOU KNOCK THAT BALL INTO THE BALLS IN THIS RACK.
AFTER I REMOVE THE RACK.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, WILLIE.
CHIEF, I THINK WILLIE IS A LITTLE ACCIDENT-PRONE.
WAIT'LL YOU SEE THIS SHOT, CHIEF.
THIS IS REALLY A BEAUTY.
SEE, I'M GONNA HIT DOWN ON THE CUE BALL, MAKE IT CURVE AROUND THE 12 BALL, GO INTO THE 8 BALL, AND KNOCK THE 8 BALL RIGHT IN THE SIDE POCKET.
MAX, YOU MIGHT BREAK THE CUE STICK.
DON'T BE SILLY, CHIEF.
I'M NOT GOING TO BREAK THE CUE STICK.
MM!
YOU SEE, CHIEF?
I TOLD YOU I WASN'T GONNA BREAK THE CUE STICK.
THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.
MAX, YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE A GOOD POOL PLAYER, BUT YOU'RE A FAKE AND A FRAUD!
YOU HAVEN'T THE VAGUEST NOTION OF HOW TO PLAY POOL!
JUST WHAT ARE YOU GETTING AT, CHIEF?
CHIEF, I THINK WILLIE HAS ONE OF YOUR HEADACHES.
THANKS ANYWAY, WILLIE.
SEND ME A BILL FOR THE DAMAGES.
Max: SO LONG, WILLIE.
I TOLD YOU HE WAS ACCIDENT-PRONE.
HERE'S THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT FOR SMART, AND I REALLY HAVE SOME GOODIES THIS TIME.
HE WON'T NEED IT.
I'M TAKING MAX OFF OF THIS ASSIGNMENT.
HE DOESN'T KNOW A THING ABOUT SHOOTING POOL.
- OH, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO.
- 99: NO.
PARKER'S DEVISED A REMOTE-CONTROL CUE BALL SO MAX CAN MAKE ANY SHOT ON THE TABLE.
GOOD WORK, PARKER.
THAT MAY BE OUR ANSWER.
MAX MUST WIN THAT FIRST GAME SO THAT THE SHARK WILL CHALLENGE HIM TO A SECOND GAME.
RIGHT.
THAT WAY I CAN WHY?
SO 99 WILL HAVE TIME TO LOOK FOR THE DECODING MACHINE.
OH, NOW WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
THAT'S DIRTY POOL.
I MEAN, IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE THAT COUNTS, IT'S HOW YOU PLAY THE GAME.
- MAX!
- HERE'S THE CUE BALL.
AND IN MY LIPSTICK IS A TRANSISTOR REMOTE CONTROL.
NOW, REMEMBER, ONCE YOU'VE HIT THE CUE BALL AND IT'S IN MOTION, I CAN MANEUVER IT ANYWHERE.
GO AHEAD, MAX.
- PERFECT.
- THANK YOU.
FOR YOUR PROTECTION, SMART, I'VE MADE A CUE STICK THAT IS ACTUALLY A SHOTGUN.
A CUE STICK THAT'S A SHOTGUN?
THAT'S FANTASTIC, PARKER.
HOW DOES IT WORK?
WELL, TO LOAD IT, YOU BREAK IT OPEN IN THE MIDDLE.
WELL, I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO LOAD IT IN A HURRY.
THAT'S A REGULAR CUE STICK, SMART.
HERE'S THE SHOTGUN.
YOU OPEN IT LIKE THIS, PLACE THE SHELL IN LIKE THIS, AND YOU CLOSE IT LIKE THIS, AND YOU'RE READY TO GO.
WELL, THAT CERTAINLY IS INGENIOUS, PARKER.
BUT, UH, HOW DO YOU FIRE IT?
SIMPLY HIT THE RUBBER TIP ON THE BACK END.
- OH.
GOTCHA.
- YOU'RE ALL SET, MAX.
I CERTAINLY AM, CHIEF, AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT, THAT KAOS DECODING MACHINE WILL BE RIGHT HERE IN CONTROL.
WELL, I GUESS I'LL JUST WARM UP A LITTLE BIT.
HEY, I LIKE THE WAY YOU HANDLE YOURSELF, KID.
I DO ALL RIGHT.
TELL THAT TO THE SHARK WHEN YOU SEE HIM.
- WHY THE SHARK?
- WELL, I'M LOOKING FOR A GAME.
$1000 A BALL.
- I'M THE SHARK.
-  OH, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T PLAY RIGHT NOW.
SORRY, FOLKS.
CLOSING TIME.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, FOLKS?
I CHALLENGED HIM TO A GAME, AND HE REFUSED.
LOOKS TO ME LIKE THE SHARK IS CHICKEN.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SHARK?
YOU AFRAID OF HIM?
THE SHARK ISN'T AFRAID OF ANYONE.
I ACCEPT.
YOU WANT TO FLIP FOR BREAK?
ALL RIGHT, SHARK, YOU CAN BREAK 'EM.
RACK 'EM UP, FITZBURG.
NOT BAD, SHARK.
THERE WON'T BE A BALL LEFT ON THE TABLE.
NICE TRY, SHARK, BUT YOU FORGOT TO ALLOW FOR THE WIND.
I'M MAKING A SHOT.
AMAZING.
THE ONLY MAN I EVER SAW MAKE THAT KIND OF A SHOT WAS THE GREAT POOL CHAMPION THREE-FINGERS YARMEY.
UH, YES.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I, UH, JUST STOLE IT OFF HIM LAST WEEK.
"LAST WEEK"?
HE'S BEEN DEAD FOR SIX YEARS.
OH.
GOOD.
WHAT HE DOESN'T KNOW WON'T HURT HIM.
THAT'S MAXWELL SMART, THE CONTROL AGENT I TOLD YOU ABOUT.
- NOW WATCH THIS.
- I'LL GET HIM.
NOT IN FRONT OF ALL THESE WITNESSES.
I'LL FINISH THE GAME FAST, GET RID OF THE PEOPLE, THEN YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM.
BEAUTIFUL.
JUST BEAUTIFUL.
THOSE ARE THE COMBINATION NUMBERS FOR THE DECODING MACHINE.
EH, IT'S A MILLION TO ONE.
I'M SHOOTING AGAIN.
-  - 99: MAX, THE BRAIN!
MAX, LOOK OUT!
HE'S GOT A GUN IN HIS BRIEFCASE!
YOUR STICK IS EMPTY, SMART.
YOU TRY ANYTHING, SHE GOES FIRST.
MAX, MY LIPSTICK.
TO BE THINKING ABOUT YOUR APPEARANCE.
MAX!
HE'S OUT COLD, MAX.
I KNOW.
I HOPE HE HASN'T SUFFERED A LOSS OF MEMORY.
HE OWES ME $13,000 FROM THE POOL GAME.
- OH, HI, CHIEF.
- MAX, THE ASSIGNMENT IS OVER.
WE'VE GOT THE SHARK.
WE'VE GOT THE DECODING MACHINE.
- THERE'S NO NEED TO PLAY POOL ANY LONGER.
- I KNOW, CHIEF, BUT I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF PRACTICING, AND I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.
YOU REMEMBER THAT SHOT I TRIED TO MAKE ONCE WHERE I MAKE THE CUE BALL GO AROUND ONE BALL AND KNOCK THE OTHER BALL INTO THE POCKET?
I'LL NEVER FORGET IT.
MAX, PLEASE.
WE'VE JUST PUT A NEW CLOTH ON THE TABLE.
DON'T BE SILLY, CHIEF.
I'M NOT GOING TO RIP THE CLOTH.
TSK.
MAX!
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
- THAT'S HIM.
THAT'S DR.
SHOTWIRE.
- I KNOW.
I STUDIED NUCLEAR PHYSICS UNDER HIM.
AND THAT'S THE SCALE MODEL OF HIS MOON CRAFT.
YOU KNOW HOW MANY COUNTRIES ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP JUST SUCH A VEHICLE?
I CAN IMAGINE.
WHOEVER PERFECTS IT FIRST WILL BE ABLE TO EXPLORE THE SURFACE OF THE MOON.
DR.
RATTON, WE WANT DR.
SHOTWIRE.
"WE"?
WHO'S WE?
- KAOS.
- OF COURSE.
AND YOU'D BE ABLE TO SELL THE PLANS FOR THE MOON CRAFT TO THE HIGHEST BIDDER.
EXACTLY.
THAT IS WHY WE'VE COME TO YOU-- PROBABLY THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED EVIL GENIUS IN AMERICA.
IN THE WORLD.
TELL ME, WHY HAVEN'T YOU BEEN ABLE TO JUST KIDNAP SHOTWIRE?
- THIS IS WHY.
-  - WHO IS THAT MAN?
- MAXWELL SMART.
AN AGENT FROM THE CONTROL ORGANIZATION.
HE HAS BEEN GUARDING DR.
SHOTWIRE DAY AND NIGHT.
YOU MEAN TO SAY YOU CAN'T GET BY THAT ONE MAN?
SOMEHOW HE HAS MANAGED TO FOIL US EVERY TIME.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE SMART TO MYSELF FOR ONE HOUR.
I'D LIKE TO HAVE HIM IN MY HANDS ALMOST AS MUCH AS I WANT DR.
SHOTWIRE.
YOU SHALL HAVE THEM BOTH WITHIN 24 HOURS.
HOW?
- YOU HEARD WHAT MR.
NATZ HAS BEEN SAYING?
- YES, SIR.
CAN YOU DELIVER SHOTWIRE AND SMART HERE, ALIVE?
- YES, SIR.
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT THIS GUY CAN SUCCEED WHERE A DOZEN WELL-TRAINED KAOS MEN HAVE FAILED?
WATCH.
WHAT'S THAT?
IT'S A VICIOUS  HE'LL TEAR HIM TO SHREDS!
INDEED HE WILL, MR.
NATZ.
YOU CARRY A WEAPON, MR.
NATZ?
ONLY THIS.
INSTANT ANALYSIS, PLEASE.
I WAS STRUCK BY THREE .
45-CALIBER BULLETS, LEAD OR COMPOSITE, WEIGHING APPROXIMATELY TRAVELING AT ALMOST MUZZLE VELOCITY OF 800 FEET PER SECOND.
IMPACT-- 456 FOOT-POUNDS PER SQUARE INCH.
WHO IS HE?
NOT HE, MR.
NATZ.
IT.
- A ROBOT?
- EXACTLY.
MY INVENTION.
STRONGEST, MOST INTELLIGENT MACHINE IN THE WORLD.
- HOW MUCH?
- $1 MILLION.
WHEN HE DELIVERS BOTH MEN.
GET SHOTWIRE AND GET SMART.
MAX, YOU'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL WITH DR.
SHOTWIRE.
TRY AND KEEP OUT OF HIS WAY WHILE YOU'RE GUARDING HIM.
HE SAYS YOU'VE SET BACK HIS WORK SIX MONTHS.
SIX MONTHS?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
THREE MONTHS, FOUR MONTHS, TOPS.
WHO'S WITH DR.
SHOTWIRE NOW?
AGENT 27.
I RELIEVE HIM IN AN HOUR.
- WELL, THE PLANS HAVE BEEN CHANGED.
- THEY HAVE?
YES, HERE'S WHAT'LL HAPPEN  THEY'RE GIVING A PARTY FOR DR.
SHOTWIRE AND I WANT YOU AND 99 TO ATTEND.
WELL, WILL THERE BE A CONTACT MAN AT THE PARTY, CHIEF?
YES, AGENT 44 HAS BEEN PLANTED AT THE PARTY ACCORDING TO PLAN G.F.C. OH, AND TAKE AGENT 91 WITH YOU.
AGENT 91?
I DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW HIM.
IS THAT A NEW NUMBER, CHIEF?
HE'S A NEW RECRUIT.
THIS IS HIS FIRST ASSIGNMENT SO I WANT YOU TO KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
HE'LL MEET YOU AT THE GARAGE OFFICE AT 8:00 TONIGHT.
HE'LL USE THIS PASSWORD-- "THE BLUE SUN MELTS THE RED SNOW".
YOUR COUNTERSIGN WILL BE, "AND THE PURPLE WATER RUNS UPHILL".
GOTCHA, CHIEF.
MAX, I WANT YOU TO USE YOUR WATCH PHONE TONIGHT.
I DON'T WANT YOU TAKING OFF YOUR SHOE AT THE PARTY.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
ANYTHING ELSE?
- YES.
HERE'S SOME INFORMATION ON THE PEOPLE WHO'LL BE AT THE PARTY.
MEMORIZE IT AND DESTROY IT BEFORE YOU LEAVE.
ANYTHING WRONG?
WELL, CHIEF, I THINK I'LL NEED A LITTLE TIME TO HAVE THIS DECODED.
HE'S NOW MEMORIZED ALL THE PERTINENT INFORMATION ABOUT SHOTWIRE'S SCIENTIFIC CAREER.
HE HAS AN I.Q. OF OVER 200.
PERFECT.
A GENIUS KILLER.
WHAT DO YOU CALL HIM?
HYMIE.
HYMIE?
I MADE HIM.
I CALL HIM WHAT I WANT.
- HYMIE?
- MY FATHER'S NAME WAS HYMIE.
OKAY, CALL HIM WHAT YOU WANT.
WHEREVER HYMIE MAY GO WE CAN OBSERVE ON A SPECIAL TV CAMERA HE'S EQUIPPED WITH.
ASIDE FROM HIS VAST KNOWLEDGE, HE HAS THE DEXTERITY TO TAKE APART AND REASSEMBLE THE ENTIRE WIRING SYSTEM OF ANY MISSILE IN THE WORLD.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING HE ISN'T ABLE TO DO.
- WHAT'S THAT?
- SET UP A LAWN CHAIR.
ALL I WANT HIM TO DO IS TO BRING ME SHOTWIRE AND SMART.
BUT I DON'T WANT SHOTWIRE HURT IN ANY WAY.
AND I'LL TAKE CARE OF SMART MYSELF.
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND, HYMIE?
- I UNDERSTAND.
OKAY.
TAKE OFF.
NO, HYMIE.
I DON'T MEAN THAT KIND OF TAKE OFF.
YOU HAVE TO BE VERY CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY TO HIM.
HE SOMETIMES RESPONDS TO THE EXACT MEANING OF WORDS.
LEAVE, HYMIE.
WE CAN FOLLOW HIS PROGRESS ON THE VIEWING SCREEN.
HE SHOULD BE AT THE CONTROL GARAGE AT 10 MINUTES TO 8:00.
THE BLUE SUN MELTS THE RED SNOW.
THE BLUE SUN MELTS THE RED SNOW.
YOU'D BETTER COME UP WITH THE RIGHT COUNTERSIGN, MAC, OR YOU'RE IN TROUBLE.
DETAIN HIM, HYMIE.
OPERATOR, QUICK!
GET ME SPECIAL WEAPONS!
THE BLUE SUN MELTS THE RED SNOW.
AND THE PURPLE WATER RUNS UPHILL.
- AGENT SMART?
- YES.
YOU MUST BE 91.
MY NAME IS HYMIE.
- HYMIE?
- MY FATHER'S NAME WAS HYMIE.
OH.
UH, THAT'S VERY NICE.
- HYMIE, THIS IS 99.
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HELLO, HYMIE.
- NOW, THIS IS OUR PLAN.
WE'RE TO GUARD DR.
SHOTWIRE AGAINST ANY AND ALL DANGERS WITHOUT HIM REALIZING THAT WE'RE DOING IT.
- RIGHT.
- HYMIE, I KNOW THAT IS IS YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT.
YOU'RE PROBABLY A LITTLE NERVOUS.
DON'T BE.
REMEMBER, EXPERIENCE ISN'T EVERYTHING.
YOU'VE ALSO GOT TO HAVE HEART.
COME ON, LET'S GO.
- SEEMS TO BE STUCK.
- YES.
HYMIE, GIVE ME A HAND.
NEVER MIND, HYMIE.
COME ON.
WITH ALL THOSE GUARDS WE SAW POSTED ON THE WAY UP, THERE ISN'T A CHANCE IN THE WORLD THAT A KAOS MAN CAN GET IN HERE.
THAT'S DR.
SHOTWIRE OVER THERE.
I WANT YOU TO KEEP HIM UNDER SURVEILLANCE, BUT DON'T GO NEAR HIM.
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME TO GIVE OUR SIDE A LITTLE EDGE.
- 99?
- Yes?
I want you to make a check on all the women here - and see if any of them look or even act suspicious.
- Right, Max.
HYMIE, DISARM SMART, BUT DON'T LET HIM KNOW IT.
DESTROY THE GUN.
NOW, YOU JUST STAY HERE AND KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU.
AND DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.
DON'T BE NERVOUS.
I HAVE COMPLETE CONFIDENCE IN YOU.
I FEEL THAT I CAN PUT MY LIFE IN YOUR HANDS.
IS THE WIND FAIR TO JAVA?
ALL CLEAR.
NO STORM ON THE HORIZON.
- I BEG YOUR PARDON?
- I SAID, THERE'S NO STORM ON THE HORIZON.
NO, THERE ISN'T.
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DIDN'T NOTICE A CLOUD IN THE SKY ON THE WAY OVER.
YOU KNOW, IF THIS NICE WEATHER KEEPS UP.
I MAY JUST TAKE A RUN DOWN TO THE BEACH TOMORROW.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- THE BEACH.
YOU WERE TELLING ME ABOUT THE WEATHER AND I SAID I MIGHT TAKE A RUN DOWN TO THE BEACH.
I WAS GIVING YOU THE COUNTERSIGN.
NO, I WAS GIVING YOU THE COUNTERSIGN.
THEN I GAVE YOU THE COUNTER-COUNTERSIGN.
BUT THAT'S THE WRONG COUNTER-COUNTERSIGN FOR MY COUNTERSIGN.
IS NOT.
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU.
HERE YOU ARE.
MIDDLE OF PAGE 18.
THAT'S THE OLD BOOK.
OH, I-I'M SORRY, 86.
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU WERE RIGHT.
IT'S JUST  JUST THAT I'VE BEEN COOPED UP IN SO MANY CLOCKS AND LOCKERS AND GLOVE COMPARTMENTS FOR SO LONG.
NOBODY TELLS ME ANYTHING!
IT ISN'T FAIR.
I'M A GOOD AGENT.
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WEAR MY TUXEDO ONCE.
NOT ONCE!
AND WHO'D SEE IT IN A CLOCK?
DON'T GET SO EMOTIONAL, 44.
HERE, YOU CAN HAVE MY BOOK.
- I-I COULDN'T DO THAT.
- GO AHEAD, TAKE IT.
I'VE ALREADY MEMORIZED IT.
FORGET THIS.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU'D DO THE SAME THING FOR ME.
NOW, BUCK UP.
I'VE GOT TO GET BACK TO THE PARTY.
EVERYTHING IS OKAY SO FAR.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS?
- NO, SIR.
- YOU CAN CALL ME MAX, HYMIE.
THIS IS 86.
COME IN, CONTROL.
MAX, WE HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A KAOS AGENT AT THE PARTY AND THAT YOU AND DR.
SHOTWIRE ARE IN GREAT DANGER.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO IT IS, CHIEF?
- YES, WE HAVE THE REAL-- -  - HELLO, MAX?
MAX?
HYMIE, YOU BROKE MY WATCH PHONE.
I'M SORRY.
I JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT TIME IT WAS.
SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED.
I'D BETTER TRY AND CONTACT AGENT 44.
HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL ME WHO THE KAOS AGENT WAS WHEN YOU GRABBED MY PHONE.
I'LL TELL 99 ABOUT IT.
AGENT 44 IS IN THE CLOCK IN THE NEXT ROOM.
ASK HIM IF HE KNOWS ANYTHING.
WELL, HOP TO IT, HYMIE.
AGENT 44, DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING?
- DID 44 SAY ANYTHING?
- NO.
WHOEVER THE KAOS AGENT IS, HE'S PROBABLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHO THE CONTROL AGENTS ARE, SO WE'VE GOT TO REMAIN INCONSPICUOUS.
LET'S NOT GIVE OURSELVES AWAY.
JUST WATCH ME AND DO EXACTLY AS I DO.
I THINK WE'VE BEEN NOTICED, HYMIE.
LET'S JUST TRY AND ACT NONCHALANT.
LET'S GO GET A DRINK.
WAITER.
THANK YOU.
OKAY, HYMIE, DRINK UP.
- WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF HE DRINKS?
- I DON'T KNOW.
HE ISN'T PROGRAMMED FOR IT.
HYMIE, DON'T DRINK.
- GO AHEAD, HYMIE, DRINK.
- DON'T DRINK.
- GO ON, HYMIE, DRINK IT UP.
- DON'T DRINK!
- DRINK!
- DON'T!
DRINK!
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- HE SHORT-CIRCUITED.
DRINK.
I'VE LOST CONTROL OF HIM.
WELL, WHAT'S HE LIKELY TO DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE MIGHT JUST STAND THERE, OR HE MIGHT DECIDE TO KILL EVERYBODY IN THAT ROOM.
WHAT'S HYMIE UP TO?
IS HE OUT OF HIS MIND?
I TOLD HIM TO STAY CLOSE TO SHOTWIRE, BUT NOT THAT CLOSE.
OUT OF THERE.
HE'S LIABLE TO REVEAL HIS IDENTITY.
- RIGHT.
- AFTER ALL, HE DOESN'T HAVE OUR EXPERIENCE.
I'LL DISTRACT DR.
SHOTWIRE WHILE YOU GET HYMIE AWAY.
RIGHT.
- HELLO, DR.
SHOTWIRE.
- OH.
OH!
DON'T I KNOW YOU FROM SOMEWHERE?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO, BUT I KNOW YOU.
YOU'RE VERY FAMOUS.
OH, NOW  I'D LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU A MINUTE, HYMIE.
COME ON, HYMIE, SHAKE A LEG.
NOW, LOOK, HYMIE, I THINK YOU'VE GOT THE MAKINGS OF A FIRST-RATE AGENT, BUT ONLY IF YOU OBEY ORDERS.
NOW, YOU WERE TOLD TO STAY AWAY FROM SHOTWIRE, WEREN'T YOU?
HYMIE, YOU'RE DRUNK.
LISTEN, HYMIE, YOU'RE A NICE GUY, BUT YOU'VE GOT TO LEARN TO HOLD YOUR LIQUOR.
SO NO MORE DRINKING.
AGREED?
JUST SAY YES OR NO, HYMIE.
YES OR NO, HYMIE.
THAT'S BETTER.
NOW, I'LL LEAVE AND YOU FOLLOW RIGHT BEHIND ME.
AND DON'T FORGET TO KILL THE LIGHT.
- HAVE YOU NOTICED ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS?
- NO, MAX.
I THINK WE OUGHT TO CHANGE OUR STRATEGY.
I THINK WE OUGHT TO GET DR.
SHOTWIRE OUT OF HERE BEFORE KAOS MAKES ITS MOVE.
EXACTLY WHAT I WAS THINKING, BUT LET ME HANDLE THIS.
I'VE GOT TO GET SHOTWIRE OUT OF HERE WITHOUT GETTING HIM TOO UPSET AND WITHOUT ANYBODY ELSE NOTICING IT.
IT HAS TO BE HANDLED WITH TREMENDOUS SUBTLETY.
EXCUSE ME, DR.
SHOTWIRE, BUT I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND STEPPING OUTSIDE WITH ME FOR A MINUTE.
YES, I WOULD MIND!
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU SECRET AGENTS!
I'VE GOT TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE, DOCTOR.
- SOMEBODY IS TRYING TO KILL YOU.
- OH, NONSENSE.
I AM BACK AGAIN, ALONZO.
PLEASE, DOCTOR.
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.
LEAVE ME ALONE.
YOU TALK TO HIM, HYMIE.
I THINK HE'S TAKEN A LIKING TO YOU.
SEE IF YOU CAN GET HIM OUT OF HERE WITHOUT ANYBODY NOTICING IT.
I'LL GO CHECK THE FRONT DOOR.
KAOS AGENT IS - HE'S GONNA TRY AND STOP US, SO BE READY FOR ANYTHING.
- RIGHT.
LET ME GET MY COAT AND I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU, HYMIE.
GREAT WORK, HYMIE, BUT HOW DID YOU GET HIM TO LEAVE?
I APPEALED TO HIS SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY.
I TOLD HIM I WAS A ROBOT.
AND HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU EVER GET HIM TO BELIEVE THAT STORY?
I SHOWED HIM MY WORKS.
HYMIE!
THAT'S INCREDIBLE!
YOU'RE REALLY PREPARED FOR EVERYTHING.
THAT'S FANTASTIC, HYMIE.
YOU SHOULD GET A MEDAL FOR THIS.
YOU KNOCK ME OUT.
MAX!
MAX, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WE'RE IN SOME KAOS HIDEOUT.
HYMIE KNOCKED YOU OUT AND BROUGHT US HERE.
HYMIE?
BUT HYMIE IS ONE OF OUR MEN.
NO, MAX, I'M AFRAID HYMIE'S ONE OF THEM.
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU STOP HIM?
- I TRIED TO, MAX, BUT HE PICKED US UP AND CARRIED US LIKE WE WERE DOLLS.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I THINK YOU'LL FIND NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HYMIE, MR.
SMART.
HE'S-- HE'S SUPERHUMAN.
- MAX, HYMIE'S A ROBOT.
- WELL, OF COURSE HE'S A ROBOT.
THAT'S WHAT HE TOLD-- A REAL ROBOT?
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND HE'S A KAOS ROBOT.
NATZ!
SO YOU'RE BEHIND ALL THIS.
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS FOR A LONG TIME, SMART.
I NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO SHOW YOU HOW GRATEFUL I AM FOR THOSE 10 LONG YEARS I SPENT IN PRISON.
YOU CALL THIS GRATITUDE?
I SPENT MOST OF THAT TIME DREAMING OF THE DAY WHEN YOU AND I WOULD MEET AGAIN, AND I WOULD ELIMINATE YOU ONCE AND FOR ALL.
WELL, I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED A MAN WITH AMBITION.
THIS, BY THE WAY, IS DR.
RATTON, HYMIE'S CREATOR.
- RATTON, THE FAMOUS INVENTOR?
- HOW DO YOU DO?
BUT YOU WERE ONCE A HIGHLY-RESPECTED SCIENTIST WORKING ON THE SIDE OF GOOD.
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT JUST DIDN'T PAY WELL ENOUGH.
NOW, MR.
SMART, I'M GOING TO ORDER HYMIE TO DESTROY YOU.
HURRY IT UP, RATTON.
DR.
SHOTWIRE AND I HAVE A PLANE TO CATCH FOR EUROPE.
HYMIE, DESTROY SMART.
I SAID, DESTROY HIM.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HYMIE.
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.
I KNOW THAT UNDER THAT METAL BODY OF YOURS THERE BEATS THE MECHANICAL HEART OF A REALLY NICE GUY.
HYMIE, YOU'RE CRYING.
TAKE IT EASY, HYMIE.
YOU'LL RUST YOUR EYEBALL.
I GAVE YOU AN ORDER, YOU MONSTER!
I ORDER YOU TO DESTROY HIM!
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD WORK.
THANK YOU, HYMIE.
I'LL GET DR.
SHOTWIRE.
HYMIE, SHAKE.
NO, HYMIE.
SHAKE HANDS.
I KNEW YOU'D COME THROUGH, HYMIE.
YOU'RE THE FIRST ONE WHO EVER TREATED ME LIKE I WAS A REAL PERSON.
I JUST COULDN'T DESTROY YOU.
OF COURSE YOU COULDN'T.
AND I KNEW YOU COULDN'T.
AFTER ALL, HYMIE, I'M NO DUMMY.
UH, WELL, WHAT I MEAN, HYMIE, IS THAT I'M A GOOD JUDGE OF MONSTERS.
INCREDIBLE.
SO REAL, SO LIFELIKE.
- THANK YOU.
- OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.
HE SAVED OUR LIVES, CHIEF.
AND WITHOUT HIM DR.
SHOTWIRE WOULD'VE BEEN TAKEN BY KAOS.
WE OWE YOU A GREAT DEBT.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO FOR YOU IN RETURN?
WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN CONTROL?
- NO, THANK YOU.
- NO?
I JUST DON'T LIKE VIOLENCE.
- WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO?
- I'D LIKE TO WORK FOR I.B.M. OH, BECAUSE OF YOUR SCIENTIFIC CURIOSITY?
NO, IT'S A NICE WAY TO MEET SOME INTELLIGENT MACHINES.
GOOD THINKING.
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- HYMIE.
- HYMIE?
HIS FATHER'S NAME WAS HYMIE.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
- MISS SLOAN?
- OH, DR.
BRAAM.
I WAS JUST CATCHING UP ON SOME LAST-MINUTE FILING, THE TRANSCRIPTS FROM TODAY'S PATIENTS.
SUCH DILIGENCE DESERVES TO BE REWARDED.
I CAN DO IT IN THE MORNING.
GOOD NIGHT, DOCTOR.
GOOD NIGHT.
ADMIRAL WEIFER'S FILE.
SO THAT'S IT.
WHAT A PITY.
TAKE CARE OF HER, GEORGE.
- HELLO.
-  - HELLO.
-  HELLO.
HELLO.
HELLO.
IS THIS MAXWELL SMART THE SECRET AGENT?
YES, THIS IS MAXWELL SMART.
BUT WHAT MAKES YOU THINK I'M A SECRET AGENT?
I LIVE IN YOUR APARTMENT HOUSE, MR.
SMART, AND ONCE I SAW YOU TALKING INTO YOUR SHOE.
WHO IS THIS?
MY NAME IS JOANNA SLOAN AND I HAVE SOME INFORMATION THAT SHOULD BE VITAL TO OUR GOVERNMENT.
I'M A SECRETARY TO DR.
MYRON BRAAM, THE PSYCHIATRIST.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MISS SLOAN, BUT I'M HANDLING MY PROBLEMS PRETTY WELL.
NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT A SECRET ORGANIZATION CALLED KAOS IS RECEIVING INFORMATION--  MR.
SMART, THEY'RE TRYING TO DROWN ME!
WELL OF COURSE THEY'RE TR-- THEY'RE TRYING TO DROWN YOU?
WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M IN A PHONE BOOTH IN THE HANCOCK BUILDING!
YOU'RE DROWNING IN A PHONE BOOTH?
MR.
SMART, THE PHONE BOOTH'S FILLING UP WITH WATER!
WELL WHY DON'T YOU LEAVE AND CALL ME FROM ANOTHER BOOTH?
I CAN'T GET OUT!
IT'S LOCKED!
NOW LOOK, MISS SLOAN, I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE OR WHAT YOUR LITTLE GAME IS BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH-- NOBODY CAN DROWN IN A PHONE BOOTH.
MISS SLOAN?
MISS SLOAN?
Operator: Yes sir?
OPERATOR, I'VE BEEN CUT OFF.
Sorry, sir.
Your party has been drowned.
YOUR EMERGENCY REPORT LAST NIGHT HAS BEEN CORROBORATED TO SOME EXTENT, 86.
A MISS JOANNA SLOAN WAS FOUND DROWNED-- IN A RIVER.
BUT I'M TELLING YOU, CHIEF, SHE WAS DROWNED IN A PHONE BOOTH.
MAX, BE REASONABLE.
HOW COULD A GIRL DROWN IN A PHONE BOOTH?
HOW DO I KNOW?
MAYBE SHE COULDN'T SWIM.
MAX, FORGET THE PHONE BOOTH.
YOU REPORTED THAT MISS SLOAN MENTIONED A POSSIBLE LINK BETWEEN HER EMPLOYER AND KAOS.
WHAT WAS THE MAN'S NAME?
MAYBE WE HAVE SOMETHING ON HIM IN OUR OMNIFILE.
WAIT A MINUTE NOW, CHIEF.
I THINK IT WAS JAAM.
THAT'S IT-- DR.
JAAM.
JAAM, CHIEF.
THAT'S WITH A "J".
"J".
JAAM, JAAM ON THE OTHER HAND, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN "SHAAM".
NO, MAYBE IT WAS "USHAAM".
NO, I THINK IT WAS "BRAAM".
"BRAAM"?
OH, HERE IT IS.
DR.
MYRON BRAAM.
ON THE OTHER HAND IT COULD HAVE BEEN "CRAAM".
MAX!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
DR.
MYRON BRAAM.
HE'S ONE OF WASHINGTON'S TOP PSYCHIATRISTS.
IF HE'S BEEN GETTING CLASSIFIED DATA FROM GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND PASSING IT ON TO KAOS-- IT COULD DESTROY OUR NATIONAL SECURITY.
WELL, HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROCEED, CHIEF?
I HAVE A PLAN.
THIS IS STEP ONE.
OH, DR.
BRAAM, THIS IS GENERAL McFARLAND AT THE PENTAGON.
WHAT I'M ABOUT TO SAY TO YOU IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, OF COURSE.
WE HAVE AN OFFICER IN OUR SPECIAL WEAPONS BRANCH NAMED COLONEL SMART.
HE'S BEEN ACTING IN A VERY DISTURBED MANNER LATELY AND IT'S SEVERELY AFFECTING HIS WORK.
Would you be able to see him later?
YES, I CAN SEE HIM AFTER MY LAST PATIENT TONIGHT.
TELL HIM TO BE HERE AROUND 6:00.
THE BUILDING WILL BE LOCKED, BUT THE JANITOR CAN LET HIM IN.
Thank you, Doctor.
FORGIVE ME, ADMIRAL.
LET'S SEE NOW AH, YES.
YOU WERE TELLING ME YOU FELT VERY GUILTY ABOUT THE THIRD FLEET.
Admiral: YES WITHOUT ANY WARNING TO THE FAMILIES OF THE CREW I HAD TO ORDER THE THIRD FLEET TO THE MEDITERRANEAN.
- NOW HERE IS STEP TWO-- - WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
THERE'S JUST ONE QUESTION I WOULD LIKE TO ASK.
YES?
WHO IS THIS COLONEL SMART?
I DON'T BELIEVE I KNOW HIM.
MAX, YOU'RE COLONEL SMART.
OH.
I AM?
YES.
NOW, MAX, I WANT YOU TO GO TO DR.
BRAAM AND POSE AS A DISTURBED ARMY OFFICER.
AS YOUR WIFE.
NOW YOU ARE TO KEEP DR.
BRAAM BUSY WHILE SHE'S SEARCHING THROUGH HIS FILES IN THE OUTER OFFICE.
OH, I GET IT.
AND THEN WHILE HE'S TALKING TO HER I'LL BE SEARCHING HIS DESK IN THE INNER OFFICE.
EXACTLY.
NOW, MAX, THIS IS A DIFFICULT ASSIGNMENT.
YOU'VE GOT TO CONVINCE THE DOCTOR THAT YOU'RE EMOTIONALLY DISTURBED.
NOW JUST A MINUTE.
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I'D DO FOR CONTROL, CHIEF, BUT THIS IS A LITTLE OUT OF THE QUESTION.
86, THIS IS AN ORDER.
NOW I WANT YOU TO GET IN TOUCH WITH DR.
STUEBEN IN OUR PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE LAB.
HE MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU A FEW IDEAS ON HOW A REALLY DISTURBED PERSON MIGHT ACT.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
BUT HONESTLY, CHIEF CAN YOU PICTURE ME AS A MENTAL PATIENT?
- DR, STUEBEN?
- YES.
YOU MUST BE 86.
SIT DOWN, PLEASE.
THE CHIEF ASKED ME TO PREPARE YOU FOR THE KIND OF QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT BE ASKED BY DR.
BRAAM-- SO THAT YOU WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN YOUR COVER.
ARE YOU A PSYCHOLOGIST, DR.
STUEBEN?
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE PSYCHOLOGISTS' SOCIETY FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND ADJUSTMENT THROUGH FULFILLMENT.
AND WHAT KIND OF AN ORGANIZATION IS THAT?
WE'RE A HATE GROUP.
A HATE GROUP?
IN THE SENSE THAT WE CURE HATE AND FEAR.
WE HATE HATE.
HATE IT.
NOW, MR.
SMART, I'M GONNA SEE YOUR RESPONSES TO A WORD ASSOCIATION TEST.
I'M GOING TO SAY A WORD AND THEN YOU'LL RESPOND WITH THE FIRST WORD THAT COMES INTO YOUR MIND.
ARE YOU READY?
- BOY.
- GIRL.
- BLACK.
- WHITE.
- WIN.
- LOSE.
- VERY GOOD.
- VERY BAD.
- STOP!
- GO.
- NO NO!
- YES YES.
ALL RIGHT!
ALL WRONG.
NOW, MR.
SMART, I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU SOME INKBLOTS ON THESE CHARTS HERE AND I WANT YOU TO TELL ME WHAT THEY REMIND YOU OF.
ARE YOU READY?
A MAN AND A WOMAN HUGGING.
HMM.
NEXT.
ANOTHER MAN AND A WOMAN HUGGING.
NEXT.
A MAN AND A WOMAN KISSING.
MR.
SMART, YOU SEEM TO SHOW A DEFINITE PREOCCUPATION WITH MEN AND WOMEN HUGGING AND KISSING.
ME?
!
YOU'RE THE ONE WITH THE WEIRD PICTURE COLLECTION!
NOW FOR OUR FINAL TEST.
SIT OVER HERE, WILL YOU PLEASE?
THIS IS A TEST THAT MEASURES YOUR TOLERANCE TO DISTRACTION.
AS YOU CAN SEE, THESE WOODEN PEGS FIT INTO THE HOLES ON THIS BOARD.
NOW FIRST YOU'RE GOING TO INSERT THE PEGS IN THE HOLES AND THERE WILL BE NO DISTRACTIONS.
THAT'S SIMPLE ENOUGH, ISN'T IT?
THAT SEEMS FAIRLY SIMPLE.
AH, BUT THEN YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN AND THE SECOND TIME YOU'LL HEAR A SYMPHONY PLAYING IN ONE EAR, A VOICE SPEAKING TO YOU IN THE OTHER AND THERE'LL BE A BRIGHT LIGHT FLASHING IN YOUR EYES.
BUT FIRST WE'LL TIME YOU WITHOUT ANY DISTRACTIONS.
- ARE YOU READY?
- MM-HMM.
- GO!
-  DOES THAT THING HAVE TO BE TICKING?
I CAN'T THINK WITH THAT THING TICKING.
BUT THAT'S THE TIMER.
IS THERE A WINDOW SHADE FLAPPING IN HERE SOMEWHERE?
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE WITH ALL THESE DISTRACTIONS.
DOC, THESE THINGS JUST DON'T FIT IN THE HOLES.
CAN'T I FORCE THEM IN?
OF COURSE YOU CAN'T FORCE THEM.
THIS IS CHILDISHLY SIMPLE.
SEE?
HERE.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THE SQUARES ARE MINE.
YOU USE THE ROUND ONES.
WAIT A MINUTE.
I THINK I'LL USE THE ROUND ONES.
YOU USE THE SQUARES.
WILL YOU STOP THAT WHISTLING?
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE!
AH, YOU MUST BE COLONEL SMART.
I TOLD YOU THIS WAS THE OFFICE.
THIS IS MY WIFE.
- HOW DO YOU DO?
- HELLO.
- I WANTED TO COME ALONE, BUT SHE WOULDN'T LET ME.
- HA!
I HAD TO DRIVE HIM HERE.
HE'S TERRIFIED BEHIND THE WHEEL.
IT'S NOT THAT.
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH MY DRIVER'S TEST.
ALMOST PASSED IT THE LAST TIME.
JUST MADE ONE LITTLE MISTAKE-- SLAMMED THE DOOR ON THE INSTRUCTOR'S HAND.
- WOULD YOU MIND WAITING FOR US OUT HERE?
- NOT AT ALL.
COME ALONG, COLONEL.
WE'LL GO INSIDE.
SIT DOWN, COLONEL.
YOU REALIZE OF COURSE, DOCTOR, THAT THIS IS QUITE EMBARRASSING FOR ME, I MEAN, HAVING TO CALL ON A PSYCHIATRIST.
NONSENSE, COLONEL.
MEN LIKE YOURSELF, RESPONSIBLE MEN IN OUR GOVERNMENT, - MAKE UP THE BULK OF MY PRACTICE.
- YOU DON'T SAY.
DO YOU REALIZE THAT A HIGH-RANKING AMERICAN OFFICIAL BREAKS DOWN EVERY DAY?
MY GOODNESS.
HOW DOES HE STAND IT?
NOW I USUALLY FIND IT MORE HELPFUL WITH MY PATIENTS IF WE USE THE COUCH.
- DO YOU MIND?
- CERTAINLY NOT, DOCTOR.
MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE.
NO, NOT ME.
FOR YOU, COLONEL.
OH.
YES, OF COURSE.
NOW COLONEL, THIS IS PROBABLY THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER HAD A PSYCHIATRIC EXAMINATION, - RIGHT?
- WRONG.
- WRONG?
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT?
- LEFT.
- PLEASE.
- THANK YOU.
- COLONEL-- - MAJOR.
NOW, COLONEL, TELL ME, WHAT IS REALLY DISTURBING YOU?
WELL, DOCTOR, YOU SEE, I KEEP GETTING THESE FANTASTIC DREAMS.
OH?
TELL ME ABOUT THEM.
WELL, IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME DREAM.
I DREAM THAT I AM SECRETARY OF THE ARMY AND I'M SITTING IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND WORD COMES THAT ALL OF MY MEN HAVE BEEN CAPTURED.
AND IN A FLASH I REALIZE THAT I'M OUT OF A JOB.
WELL, PEOPLE OFTEN DREAM OF HAVING GREAT POWER.
I MYSELF FREQUENTLY DREAM THAT I AM A RULER OF A LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRY.
DO YOU NEED A SECRETARY OF THE ARMY?
A GREAT MANY MEN WHO BEAR A GRAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR NATION'S SAFETY FIND THE BURDEN TOO GREAT AT TIMES.
NOW MANY OF MY PATIENTS FIND CERTAIN RELIEF BY SHARING THESE BURDENS WITH THEIR PSYCHIATRIST.
YOU REALLY THINK THAT WILL HELP, DOCTOR?
I KNOW IT WOULD.
NOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL ME ABOUT YOUR WORK?
ALL RIGHT, DOCTOR.
YOU KNOW, I'M WITH MISSILE RESEARCH AND WE JUST SENT A ROCKET UP YESTERDAY.
- IS THAT SO?
- YES.
DO YOU KNOW, DOCTOR, THAT THAT ROCKET REACHED A MAXIMUM SPEED OF 185,000 MILES PER HOUR?
FANTASTIC!
AT WHAT STAGE DID IT REACH THAT SPEED?
JUST BEFORE IT CRASHED.
WHERE WAS THAT?
DOWNTOWN ALBUQUERQUE.
I SEE.
HOW VERY UNFORTUNATE.
YES, AND I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULDN'T MENTION IT, DOCTOR.
YOU KNOW HOW THE PRESS IS-- GET AHOLD OF SOMETHING LIKE THIS, RIGHT AWAY THEY'LL TRY TO MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF IT.
I HAVE A FEELING THE PUBLIC WILL FIND OUT SOONER OR LATER, THOUGH.
WHY IS THAT?
IT WAS TELEVISED.
I SEE.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?
LET ME SEE YES, DOCTOR.
YOU SEE, I'M WORKING ON A TOP SECRET SPACE VEHICLE OF MY OWN.
WHAT IS THIS SPACE VEHICLE?
GOSSAMER WINGS.
GOSSAMER WINGS?
A TRIP TO THE MOON ON GOSSAMER WINGS.
AND WHAT HAPPENED?
IT WAS JUST ONE OF THOSE THINGS.
- COLONEL SMART-- -  EXCUSE ME.
I MUST SEE WHAT'S GOING ON OUT THERE.
I'LL BET THAT'S MY WIFE.
SHE HAS A CLEANING FETISH!
MRS.
SMART.
YOUR FILES ARE FILTHY.
I APOLOGIZE FOR THE CONDITION OF MY FILES, MRS.
SMART, BUT I LOST MY SECRETARY ONLY YESTERDAY.
THAT WAS VERY CARELESS OF YOU.
NO DOUBT.
NOW WOULD YOU MIND SITTING DOWN?
AND YOUR CHAIR IS DUSTY.
PLEASE RELAX, MRS.
SMART.
I MUST GET BACK TO MY PATIENT.
Admiral: I had to order the Third Fleet to the Mediterranean.
IS MY WIFE ALL RIGHT?
YES, COLONEL SMART, IF THAT'S REALLY YOUR NAME.
YOUR WIFE'S ALL RIGHT.
BUT I'M AFRAID YOU'RE NOT.
- MARKOVICH?
- Yes, sir?
THE YOUNG WOMAN IN THE FRONT OFFICE-- BRING HER IN HERE.
Right.
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS?
I SAW YOU SEARCHING MY OFFICE, COLONEL.
- THAT'S PART OF MY NEUROSIS.
- YEAH?
WELL, IT'S A NEUROSIS THAT YOU'LL NEVER LIVE TO CURE.
THERE'S NO ONE OUT HERE.
WELL, THE BUILDING'S LOCKED.
SHE CAN'T GET AWAY.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF THE COLONEL FIRST, THEN WE'LL GET THE GIRL.
DR.
BRAAM, YOU'RE A SICK MAN.
MAX, IN HERE.
THEY'RE BOTH IN THE PHONE BOOTH.
HOW CONVENIENT.
GOOD WORK, 99.
YOU'RE A LIFESAVER.
THEY'LL NEVER THINK OF LOOKING IN HERE.
AFTER THEY'VE GONE BY WE CAN SNEAK BACK AND GET OUT A WINDOW.
RIGHT.
THERE'S NO PLACE SAFER IN THE WORLD TO HIDE THAN A PHONE BOOTH.
MAX, WATER!
LET'S GO.
- 99, WE'RE LOCKED IN.
- BUT HOW?
I DON'T KNOW.
THE DOORS MUST SEAL AUTOMATICALLY - WHEN THE WATER IS RELEASED.
- OH!
THIS IS SOME KIND OF SHATTERPROOF GLASS.
ORDINARY PHONE BOOTH.
MAX, WHAT DO WE DO?
I DON'T KNOW.
IF I HAD A GUN WE COULD BLAST OUR WAY OUT.
- I'VE GOT A GUN!
- OH GOOD, GIVE IT TO ME!
OH, NO, I LEFT IT IN MY PURSE IN DR.
BRAAM'S WAITING ROOM.
MAX, YOUR TELEPHONE SHOE!
WE CAN CALL THE CHIEF!
RIGHT!
- SHORT CIRCUIT, 99.
- OH NO.
IF WE COULD ONLY CALL THE CHIEF.
WAIT.
WE'RE IN A PHONE BOOTH.
OF COURSE WE'RE-- RIGHT, 99.
ALL I HAVE IS A QUARTER.
OH, MAX, USE THE QUARTER!
USE A QUARTER FOR A 10¢ PHONE CALL?
AROUND LIKE THAT YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING LEFT FOR A RAINY DAY.
MAX, HURRY!
OH, ALL RIGHT.
OH Operator.
HELLO, OPERATOR?
NOW LISTEN TO ME AND LISTEN CAREFULLY-- I WANT YOU TO GET ME A SPECIAL WASHINGTON PHONE NUMBER.
THIS IS A TOP-SECRET NUMBER.
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE KNOW IT.
I WANT YOU TO FORGET IT THE MINUTE THAT I TELL IT TO YOU.
THE NUMBER IS 628-3097.
Oh, you want Control.
- One moment please.
-  Chief: Hello?
HELLO, CHIEF.
THIS IS MAX.
LISTEN, CHIEF, YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING FUNNY?
I'M DROWNING IN A PHONE BOOTH.
DROWNING IN A PHONE BOOTH?
YES, CHIEF.
YOU SEE, WHAT I TOLD YOU ABOUT MISS SLOAN-- THAT WAS RIGHT.
SHE DIDN'T DROWN IN THE RIVER.
MAX, PLEASE TELL HIM WHERE WE ARE!
OH, RIGHT, 99.
CHIEF, I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED HELP IN A HURRY.
- WHERE ARE YOU, MAX?
- UH-- Operator: I'm sorry.
Your time is up.
Insert 10¢ more, please.
BUT, OPERATOR, I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE CHANGE AND THIS IS A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH.
That's what they all say, sir.
MAX, THE WATER, IT'S RISING.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
TAKE BIG SWALLOWS.
LISTEN, 99, I THINK WE CAN BUY SOME TIME IF ONE OF US HELPS THE OTHER ONE UP ON THEIR SHOULDER.
- GOOD THINKING, 86.
- GIVE ME A BOOST UP.
NO, MAX, WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER IF I GOT ON YOUR SHOULDERS?
RIGHT, 99, OKAY.
WHAT'S WRONG, MAX?
GIVE ME A "ONE-TWO-THREE, UP".
ONE-TWO-THREE, UP!
NOW WHAT'S WRONG?
WELL, YOUR "ONE-TWO-THREE" WAS NICE, BUT YOUR "UP" WAS A LITTLE SLOPPY.
OH, MAX, HURRY!
RIGHT.
AND BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR RING, 99.
- OH, MAX!
- WHAT?
MY RING-- IT'S A DIAMOND!
SO WHAT?
IT CUTS GLASS.
THAT FILING CABINET NEARLY EMPTY, MARKOVICH?
JUST ABOUT, DOCTOR.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
I'M GOING TO GET THESE PAPERS BACK TO KAOS THEN I'M GETTING OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
WHAT ABOUT ME?
YOU'LL STAY HERE, GET RID OF THE BODIES AND JOIN ME AT THE AIRPORT TONIGHT.
ANYBODY GOT A TOWEL?
- SMART!
- THAT'S RIGHT.
NOW JUST TAKE IT EASY, GET UP, AND RAISE YOUR HANDS.
COME ON, YOU TOO.
UP!
WELL, DR.
BRAAM, IT LOOKS LIKE YOUR LITTLE GAME IS OVER.
AND SO IT MUST ALWAYS END FOR THOSE WHO USE THE HUMAN BRAIN FOR EVIL INSTEAD OF FRIENDLINESS.
HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF THAT BOOTH?
AS A PSYCHIATRIST, DR.
BRAAM, YOU SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THE TYPE OF MAN YOU WERE DEALING WITH-- RESOURCEFUL, CUNNING, A MAN WHO THINKS FAST AND DOES A VERY NICE JOB UNDER PRESSURE.
I WANT TO KNOW HOW YOU GOT OUT OF THAT BOOTH.
TO CUT OUR WAY THROUGH THE GLASS OF THE BOOTH.
VERY CLEVER, SMART.
THANK YOU.
YOU SEE, DR.
BRAAM, YOU NEVER REALLY HAD A CHANCE.
BEHIND YOU STANDS THE KAOS HIGH COMMAND, BUT BEHIND ME IS THE CHIEF-- A SILENT, DEDICATED MAN WHO WOULD WILLINGLY SEND MEN TO THEIR DEATH TO OVERCOME YOU.
THERE'S JUST ONE QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK, DR.
BRAAM.
YEAH?
AS A PSYCHIATRIST, DO YOU THINK YOU CAN HELP HIM?
COME IN, MAX.
- THAT WAS GOOD WORK YOU DID LAST NIGHT.
- THANK YOU, CHIEF.
TELL ME, DID YOU FIND ANY FIRM EVIDENCE OF ESPIONAGE THAT WILL STAND UP IN COURT?
I CERTAINLY DID.
WAIT TILL YOU HEAR THIS, CHIEF.
Max's voice: But behind me is the Chief-- a silent, dedicated man who would willingly send men to their death-- UH, THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD STUFF IN THERE, CHIEF.
SO I SEE.
WELL, THAT BUSINESS ABOUT SENDING MEN TO THEIR DEATH-- I DIDN'T MEAN THAT, CHIEF.
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.
I DID NEARLY SEND YOU AND 99 TO YOUR DEATHS.
BUT THAT IS MY JOB, AND IT'S A FILTHY JOB.
I WONDER HOW IT ALL STARTED.
WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME ABOUT IT, CHIEF?
WELL, I GUESS IT ALL STARTED WHEN I WAS A CHILD.
I WAS DIFFERENT SOMEHOW FROM OTHER CHILDREN-- SORT OF AN OUTCAST.
THEN I STARTED HAVING THIS RECURRING DREAM THAT I WAS SECRETARY OF THE ARMY AND I WAS IN THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE AND WORD CAME TO ME THAT ALL MY MEN HAD BEEN CAPTURED.
IN ONE BLINDING FLASH IT CAME TO ME THAT YOU WERE OUT OF A JOB.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?
I LOST MY JOB THE SAME WAY, CHIEF.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
- WHO IS IT?
- MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86 OF CONTROL.
AH, I SEE IT REACHED CONTROL'S HEADQUARTERS.
YES, BUT IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE RECEIVED A MESSAGE BY CARRIER PIGEON.
OH, WE'RE PRETTY OLD-FASHIONED HERE IN SPY CITY.
AFTER ALL, THIS IS A RETIREMENT HOME FOR SECRET AGENTS.
YES.
IS THIS PIGEON ALSO RETIRED?
- NOT YET.
- WELL, HE SHOULD BE.
HE COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY BACK HERE.
WELL, THIS IS CERTAINLY A NICE PLACE YOU'VE GOT HERE.
WELL, IT'S NOT VERY MUCH, BUT I CALL IT HOME.
WELL, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO MEETING YOU, MR.
GAFFER.
I'M FLATTERED.
I DIDN'T THINK ANYONE EVEN REMEMBERED WHO I AM.
REMEMBERED YOU?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
HERBERT GAFFER, THE WORLD-FAMOUS CONTROL AGENT #4?
MY GOSH, YOU'RE A LEGEND IN YOUR OWN TIME.
- THANK YOU.
-AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'VE PATTERNED MYSELF AFTER YOU.
I'VE COPIED YOUR TECHNIQUE AND YOUR STYLE.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOUR MESSAGE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT SOMEONE TRYING TO BREAK INTO YOUR ROOM.
NOW WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO DO THAT?
PROBABLY JUST TO READ MY DIARY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- I'LL GET IT.
- NO, I'LL GET IT.
WHY DON'T WE TALK OVER THERE, AWAY FROM THE TABLE?
NOW WHAT'S ALL THIS ABOUT A DIARY, MR.
GAFFER?
WELL, I'VE BEEN KEEPING A PERSONAL DIARY EVER SINCE I FIRST BECAME AN AGENT.
I'M AFRAID IT CONTAINS A LOT OF SECRET INFORMATION ABOUT OUR CODE SYSTEM AND OUR PERSONNEL AND THE LOCATION OF ALL OF OUR CONTROL BASES.
- I'M SHOCKED.
- I KNOW.
TO THINK THAT SOMEONE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT SOMEONE ELSE'S PERSONAL DIARY!
WELL, I WANT TO TURN THE DIARY OVER TO CONTROL FOR SAFEKEEPING.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, GAFFER.
I HAVE IT HIDDEN.
SHALL I GET IT NOW?
YES.
KEEP TALKING.
UH, I'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER TURNING THE DIARY OVER TO YOU.
IT WILL BE MUCH SAFER IN CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.
THERE'S NOBODY THERE.
WELL, THAT'S FUNNY.
THERE'S NOBODY HERE EITHER.
CHIEF, I THINK I'VE GOT IT FIGURED OUT.
NOW SEE IF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE TO YOU.
WHOEVER TOOK GAFFER FROM HIS ROOM PROBABLY WANTED HIS DIARY.
RIGHT, MAX.
AND WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT FIRST.
IF THE INFORMATION IN THAT DIARY SHOULD EVER FALL INTO ENEMY HANDS, IT WILL MEAN THE END OF CONTROL.
WE'D BE FINISHED.
CHIEF, HERE'S THE LAYOUT FOR SPY CITY.
NOW THIS IS THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND SHOWS ALL OF THE SECRET ROOMS, PASSAGES AND PANELS.
THIS MIGHT HELP GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF WHERE BOTH GAFFER AND THE DIARY COULD BE HIDDEN.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
THIS IS A LITTLE FADED.
SHOULDN'T WE ACTIVATE THE MAGNA-LAMP?
I CAN SEE IT FINE.
WELL, WE DON'T WANT TO MISS ANY OF THE LITTLE DETAILS.
WE DON'T NEED THE MAGNA-LAMP, MAX.
WELL, CHIEF, IS EITHER THE MAGNA-LAMP OR THE CONE OF SILENCE, TAKE YOUR CHOICE.
OH, PLEASE, MAX.
I DON'T THINK I COULD STAND ANOTHER SESSION WITH THE CONE OF SILENCE.
ALL RIGHT, THE MAGNA-LAMP.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
I'LL TURN IT ON.
NOW THERE'S A SPOT WHERE THE DIARY COULD BE HIDDEN.
- WHERE, CHIEF?
- RIGHT THERE WHERE I'M POINTING.
I CAN'T SEE YOUR FINGER, CHIEF.
- CAN YOU, 99?
- I CAN'T EVEN SEE YOU, MAX.
WELL, I'M STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU I THINK.
WAIT A MINUTE, I'LL TAKE YOUR HAND.
THERE.
THAT'S MY HAND, MAX.
GOOD.
NOW I CAN SEE WHERE YOU'RE POINTING, CHIEF.
I'M NOT POINTING NOW.
I CAN'T EVEN SEE THE PLANS ANYMORE!
TURN OFF THE LAMP!
TURN IT OFF, MAX.
I CAN'T FIND THE SWITCH, CHIEF.
NEVER MIND.
YOU CAN LOOK AT THE PLAN ON YOUR WAY TO SPY CITY.
IF YOU NEED ANY ASSISTANCE WHILE YOU'RE THERE, SEE MY OLD FRIEND, AGENT 8, AND USE CONTACT PLAN 6.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- AND ANYTHING ELSE YOU MIGHT NEED, SEE OUR RETIRED LAB MAN, PROFESSOR BUSH.
HE WAS A FRIEND OF GAFFER, AND MIGHT BE A GOOD MAN TO LOOK UP FIRST.
WE'D BETTER HURRY, CHIEF.
WHOEVER KIDNAPPED MR.
GAFFER IT'S GOING TO BE TRYING TO MAKE HIM TALK.
IS GOING TO BE A RACE TO SEE WHO FINDS THAT DIARY FIRST.
Max: DON'T WORRY ABOUT A THING.
NOTHING CAN GO WRONG ONCE I GET A LOOK AT THE PLANS FOR SPY CITY.
GAFFER, THEY'LL NEVER THINK TO LOOK FOR YOU HERE RIGHT UNDER THEIR VERY NOSES.
NOW ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHERE THE DIARY IS HIDDEN?
NO.
I'LL NEVER TELL.
YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF A LOT OF PAIN.
I'M GONNA FIND IT ANYWAY.
SOMEONE'S COMING.
THAT'LL KEEP YOU QUIET.
-  -  Man #2: JUST LET ME GET THIS LIGHT ON.
I INVENTED MOST OF THE DEVICES YOU SEE HERE IN OUR SPY CITY MUSEUM.
YES, WELL, THAT'S ALL VERY INTERESTING, PROFESSOR, BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE TIME TO LOOK AROUND.
YOU WERE VERY CLOSE TO MR.
GAFFER, WEREN'T YOU?
OH, YES.
HERB AND I WERE GOOD BUDDIES.
I SURE HOPE HE'S OKAY.
OH, I INVENTED THE FIRST MICRO-DOT, YOU KNOW, SHOWED CONTROL HOW THEY CAN WRITE AN ENTIRE MESSAGE ON ONE SINGLE DOT.
LOOK, HERE'S THE FIRST ONE I MADE.
Max: YES, WELL, THAT'S VERY NICE PROFESSOR, BUT WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET A LARGER MESSAGE?
OH, YOU WRITE SMALLER.
YES, AND I INTRODUCED THE FIRST SILENCER TOO, SEE?
BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ORDINARY GUN TO ME.
WHERE'S THE SILENCER?
RIGHT HERE.
JUST BEFORE YOU PULL THE TRIGGER, YOU SCREAM AS LOUD AS YOU CAN, AND THAT COVERS THE SOUND OF THE GUNSHOT.
PROFESSOR, WE'RE LOOKING FOR MR.
GAFFER'S DIARY.
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND IT.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE IT MIGHT BE HIDDEN?
I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE OLD HERB KEPT A DIARY.
Max: WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH, PROFESSOR.
UH, JUST ONE MORE THING-- YOU SAID YOU KNOW SOME OF MR.
GAFFER'S FRIENDS.
OH, YES.
THEY'RE IN THE RECREATION ROOM.
IT'S THIS WAY.
HEY, VERY GOOD.
THOSE TWO LIVE ON THE SAME FLOOR AS HERB GAFFER.
THE MAN IS GEORGE NEWFIELD, AND THE LADY IS AGNES DAVENPORT, SECURITY AGENT 11, RETIRED.
IF YOU WANT ME FOR ANYTHING I'LL BE IN MY ROOM.
- I'LL CHECK OUT NEWFIELD.
- I'LL CHECK AGNES DAVENPORT.
I HAVE A WAY WITH WOMEN.
PARDON ME, AREN'T YOU AGNES DAVENPORT, CONTROL'S FORMER TOP SECURITY AGENT?
OH NOW, YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
I SAW BUSH POINTING ME OUT.
YES, WELL, YOU CAN'T BE TOO CAREFUL ABOUT THESE THINGS.
NO, YOU CAN'T.
AND WHO ARE YOU, YOUNG MAN?
MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86 OF CONTROL.
OH, WELL, NOW HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE FROM CONTROL?
WELL, I'LL PROVE IT TO YOU.
OKAY, YOU'RE CLEAR.
IT'S A GOOD THING FOR HER SHE'S RETIRED.
MAX, MR.
NEWFIELD NEVER EVEN HEARD OF MR.
GAFFER'S DIARY.
OH?
HOW ABOUT YOU, TIGER?
DIARY?
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HE KEPT ONE.
KEEP AN EYE ON HER, 99.
I DON'T TRUST HER.
AND DON'T MAKE ANY SUDDEN MOVES FOR YOUR WALLET.
MAX, I THINK WE'D BETTER SEARCH MR.
GAFFER'S ROOM.
WE WILL, AS SOON AS I CONTACT AGENT 8.
RIGHT.
SEE YOU IN A FEW MINUTES.
- AGENT 8?
- YES?
MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86 FROM CONTROL.
I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT YOU.
OH, GOOD.
NO ONE HAS CONTACTED ME IN YEARS.
LISTEN, I HAVE A BIG BACKLOG OF MESSAGES HERE.
SOME OF THEM WERE HERE WHEN I CAME, PINNED TO THE BULLETIN BOARD.
"THE BRITISH ARE COMING"?
"PLEASE NOTIFY ME IMMEDIATELY IF THERE IS ANY TRUTH TO A WILD RUMOR THAT INDIANS ARE ON THE WARPATH".
I CAN'T MAKE OUT THE SIGNATURE.
GENERAL CUSTER.
YOU'D BETTER GET THOSE BACK TO CONTROL RIGHT AWAY.
THEY'RE PROBABLY WAITING FOR THEM.
YES, WELL, RIGHT NOW I'M LOOKING FOR HERB GAFFER'S DIARY.
- I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?
- OF COURSE I DO!
EVERYONE HERE KNOWS ABOUT OLD HERB'S DIARY.
DIARY.
GAFFER.
YEAH.
I THOUGHT I REMEMBERED IT.
HE LEFT THIS WITH ME-- "IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO ME AND YOU WANT TO LOCATE MY DIARY, THINK OF  'BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER.
'" THAT'S THE LEAD I'VE BEEN HOPING FOR.
"BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER".
WELL, THEN THAT MUST MEAN THAT THE DIARY IS HIDDEN SOMEWHERE NEAR BIRDS.
AND HIS WHOLE ROOM IS FILLED WITH BIRDS.
THANK YOU, EIGHT.
DON'T SLAM THE DARTBOARD.
WELL, WE'VE EXAMINED ALL THE BIRDS IN THE ROOM, MAX.
- I GUESS THE DIARY ISN'T HERE.
- YES, SO I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT, 99.
MAX, LOOK.
HERE'S SOMETHING.
A PAINTING OF BIRDS.
I BET THE DIARY IS BEHIND IT.
NO.
NOT THERE.
WELL, I GUESS WE'VE RUN OUT OF BIRDS.
NOT QUITE YET, 99.
WE OVERLOOKED ONE THING.
WHAT IS IT?
A BOOK.
"BIRDS OF THE USA".
- FIND SOMETHING?
- YES.
- WHAT?
- A YELLOW-BELLIED SAPSUCKER.
MAX, LOOK.
I MADE THE SAME MISTAKE ONCE BEFORE, 99.
IT'S THE WRONG DRAPE.
COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!
- NOT YOU, MAX.
- OH.
WELL, IT'S OUR OLD FRIEND THE HANDYMAN.
IT'S NOT ON HIM, 99.
SO YOU HAVEN'T FOUND THE DIARY EITHER.
DON'T WORRY.
WE WILL.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, 99?
- HE SAID "WE".
- YES.
OBVIOUSLY HE'S IN THIS WITH A FRIEND.
HE SURE DIDN'T PICK HIS FRIENDS TOO CAREFULLY.
- NEWFIELD.
- PRESENT.
- BUSH.
- PRESENT.
- DAVENPORT.
- PRESENT.
OKAY, ALL PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR.
NOW YOU'VE ALL BEEN ASSIGNED AN AREA TO SEARCH AND I WANT EACH OF YOU TO BE SURE TO COVER YOUR AREA - THOROUGHLY.
- I SUPPOSE THERE IS A REASON WHY WE ARE SEARCHING AREAS WHERE THERE ARE BIRDS.
YES.
MR.
GAFFER LEFT US A  "BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER".
SO AGENT 86 IS CERTAIN THAT THE DIARY IS HIDDEN NEAR BIRDS.
- DON'T WORRY.
- WE'LL FIND IT.
OH, IT'S GREAT TO BE BACK IN ACTION.
IS THIS A COMPLETE LIST?
I MEAN, ARE YOU SURE THERE ARE NO OTHER PLACES AROUND SPY CITY WHERE BIRDS CAN BE FOUND?
LIKE, SAY, RIGHT HERE IN THIS RECREATION ROOM?
OF COURSE NOT.
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I MADE UP THAT LIST MYSELF.
I KNOW MY BUSINESS.
YES, I'M SURE YOU DO.
IN THAT CASE, YOU CAN COVER THE LAST PLACE ON THE LIST-- THE BIRDBATH.
JUST LEFT THIS ROOM.
YOU MEAN THAT ONE OF THOSE THREE IS ALSO AN ENEMY AGENT, RIGHT?
WRONG.
IT'S OUR MAN IN THE DARTBOARD.
AGENT 8?
BUT HE CAN'T BE, MAX.
HE'S SUCH A SWEET OLD MAN.
BESIDES, HE'S HELPING US.
HE'S THE ONE THAT MADE UP THE LIST.
YES, AND CONVENIENTLY LEFT OUT ONE PLACE-- RIGHT HERE IN HIS OWN TERRITORY.
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?
IT'S A BADMINTON SHUTTLECOCK, ALSO KNOWN AS A "BIRD".
SAID THOSE OTHER THREE KNEW ABOUT GAFFER'S DIARY.
I'M ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, COMPLETELY AND FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT AGENT 8 IS THE DOUBLE AGENT.
AGENT 8 IS THE CHIEF'S BEST FRIEND.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THAT AGNES WHAT'S-HER-NAME HAS VERY SHIFTY EYES.
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT WE'LL DO, 99-- I'LL SEARCH FOR THE DIARY, YOU'LL LOOK OUT FOR AGENT 8.
NOW IF I DON'T FIND ANYTHING, I'LL PUT EVERYTHING BACK THE WAY IT WAS AND HE'LL NEVER KNOW THAT HE WAS UNDER SUSPICION.
RIGHT.
NO.
NEVER TELL WHERE DIARY IS.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL KILL ME.
NEVER TALK.
- MAX, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?
- NOTHING.
-  - MAX, I THINK I HEAR AGENT 8 COMING.
YOU'D BETTER PUT THAT STUFF BACK IN A HURRY.
MAX, HE'S COMING.
I CHECKED THE BIRDBATH.
NO SIGN OF THE DIARY.
THAT'LL BE ALL FOR NOW, 8.
I'LL CALL YOU IF I NEED YOU.
DON'T SLAM THE DARTBOARD.
WELL, HE'S NOT THE DOUBLE AGENT.
WELL, THEN IT MUST BE ONE OF THE OTHERS.
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE TO PROVE IT.
HERE THEY COME.
GOOD.
I'LL TRY MANEUVER X-14 ON THEM.
BUT MANEUVER X-14 HAS NEVER WORKED, MAX.
WELL, THERE'S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME.
BESIDES, IT'S GOT A WONDERFUL ELEMENT OF SURPRISE.
NEWFIELD, BUSH, DAVENPORT, GIVE ME AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION-- I WANT A STRAIGHT YES OR NO-- IS ONE OF YOU A DOUBLE AGENT?
NO!
SO MUCH FOR X-14.
NOW HOW ABOUT THE DIARY?
NO ONE COULD FIND IT.
WELL, THAT MEANS THAT SOMEONE HAS BEATEN US TO IT, OR ONE OF THOSE BIRDS IS THE DOUBLE AGENT.
Newfield: MAYBE IT STILL HASN'T BEEN FOUND, SMART.
THERE'S ONE WAY WE COULD BE CERTAIN.
- OH?
HOW?
- BY SETTING A TRAP.
MISS DAVENPORT, PROFESSOR BUSH AND I WILL TELL EVERYONE AT SPY CITY THAT YOU ARE SURE THAT THE DIARY IS STILL IN HERB GAFFER'S ROOM.
THEN IF SOMEONE ATTEMPTS TO PROWL AROUND AND SEARCH THE ROOM AGAIN, YOU'LL KNOW THAT IT HASN'T BEEN FOUND YET.
I LIKE THAT, NEWFIELD.
BUT UNLESS WE LEAVE THE ROOM COMPLETELY UNGUARDED, - NOBODY WILL GO NEAR IT.
- THAT'S PART OF THE TRAP.
YOU CAN USE PROFESSOR BUSH'S INVISIBLE DUST.
OH, YES, MY INVISIBLE DUST.
BUT THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE.
THAT'S WHY IT'S CALLED "INVISIBLE DUST".
FIVE MINUTES AFTER IT'S ON THE PROWLER'S SHOES, IT TURNS BLACK AND LEAVES TRACKS WHEREVER THE PROWLER HAS STEPPED.
THAT'S INGENIOUS, PROFESSOR.
YES, BUT JUST ONE THING, PROFESSOR-- HOW DO YOU GET HIM TO STICK HIS FOOT INTO THE PAIL?
THE DUST IS SPRINKLED ON THE FLOOR.
PROBABLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR, MAX.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, 99, I'D LIKE TO HANDLE THIS.
NOW MY IDEA IS THIS-- WE SPRINKLE THE DUST ON THE FLOOR RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOORWAY.
Bush: THEN IT'S SETTLED.
I'LL GO DO IT.
GIVE ME HALF AN HOUR, AND THEN YOU CAN CHECK THE ROOM.
WE CAN USE THAT HALF HOUR TO LOOK FOR MR.
GAFFER, MAX.
FORGET ABOUT GAFFER, 99.
THERE'S NO POINT IN EVEN LOOKING FOR HIM.
HE'S NOT IN THIS ROOM, HE'S NOT IN THE RECREATION HALL, AND I HAVE A FEELING HE'S NOT WITHIN 10 MILES OF SPY CITY.
BELIEVE ME, 99, I HAVE AN INCREDIBLY KEEN SENSE ABOUT THESE THINGS.
- NEWFIELD'S IDEA WORKED.
- NOW WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT SOMEONE IS STILL LOOKING FOR THE DIARY.
YES, BUT THIS IS ALL VERY CONFUSING, 99.
THE FOOTSTEPS LEAD IN AND THEN THEY LEAD OUT AGAIN.
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW THEM UNTIL THEY STOP.
THIS COULD BE DANGEROUS.
DO YOU HAVE YOUR GUN?
- YES.
WE'D BETTER USE OUR SILENCERS, 99.
- WHY?
- WELL, AFTER ALL, THIS IS A RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.
- I KNOW THAT.
PEOPLE GO TO SLEEP EARLY.
HEY, YOU DON'T WANT TO WAKE EVERYBODY UP, DO YOU?
LOOK, 99, HE HAD ANOTHER PAIR OF SHOES WAITING.
THE OLD SHOE SWITCH.
YES, THAT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE FALLEN FOR IT THIS MONTH.
-  - WHAT'S THE MATTER, 99?
- NOTHING.
- DIDN'T YOU GROAN?
- NO, I THOUGHT YOU DID.
- NO, IT WASN'T ME.
IF IT WASN'T ME AND IT WASN'T YOU THEN IT COULDN'T BE ANYBODY ELSE EXCEPT THAT DUMMY LYING OVER THERE ON THE TORTURE RACK.
- DO DUMMIES GROAN?
- NO.
NOT UNLESS THEY'RE IN GREAT PAIN.
-  - THAT ONE IS.
THAT'S NO DUMMY.
THAT'S MR.
GAFFER.
- THANK YOU.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
FINE, I THINK.
- 99, GET THOSE SHACKLES OFF.
- RIGHT.
MR.
GAFFER, WE LOOKED EVERYWHERE FOR YOUR DIARY, BUT WE COULDN'T FIND IT.
IT WASN'T NEAR ANY BIRDS.
WELL, BIRDS HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT, SMART.
- THEY DIDN'T?
- NO.
THE CLUE WAS "BIRDS OF A FEATHER FLOCK TOGETHER".
NOW YOU START BY ELIMINATING ALL THE UNNECESSARY WORDS, WHICH LEAVES YOU WITH THE NECESSARY WORD.
NOW THERE ARE 28 LETTERS IN THE CLUE.
I'M AGENT 4.
YOU DIVIDE 28 BY FOUR, AND YOU ARRIVE AT SEVEN.
NOW THERE ARE SIX WORDS IN THE CLUE, BUT ONLY ONE WORD WITH SEVEN LETTERS-- "FEATHER".
IT'S SO SIMPLE.
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF IT MYSELF.
AND HERE IS THE DIARY, RIGHT BEHIND THIS FEATHER.
I'LL TAKE IT.
AND YOUR GUNS TOO.
NOW TAKE THEM OUT VERY SLOWLY.
PUT THEM RIGHT THERE ON THE CASE VERY CAREFULLY.
NOW GET YOUR HANDS UP AND BACK AWAY FROM THE CASE.
BUT YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SUGGESTED THE TRAP AND THE INVISIBLE DUST.
OF COURSE HE DID, 99.
HE DELIBERATELY SET THOSE FOOTPRINTS KNOWING THEY'D LEAD US TO MR.
GAFFER AND HE'D TELL US ABOUT THE DIARY.
- DUCK.
-  PROFESSOR BUSH'S UMBRELLA, RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
-  - Gaffer: OPEN IT UP.
THE UMBRELLA PART IS A SHIELD.
HEY, I THOUGHT YOU SAID THIS WAS A SHIELD.
IT IS, BUT I JUST REMEMBERED-- NOT AGAINST BULLETS.
-  -  WELL, I CERTAINLY HAVE TO GIVE PROFESSOR BUSH CREDIT.
THIS IS A WONDERFUL GUN IF IT DOESN'T RAIN.
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS WHY DID MISS DAVENPORT AND PROFESSOR BUSH PRETENDED THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOUR DIARY.
WELL, THEY KNEW IT CONTAINED CONTROL SECRETS AND THEY WANTED TO PROTECT MY REPUTATION.
THAT'S RIGHT, 99.
AFTER ALL, MR.
GAFFER IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST.
HE'S MY IDOL.
DID YOU KNOW THAT MR.
GAFFER ONCE CAPTURED WITH MACHINE GUNS?
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
MACHINE GUNS.
I FIND THAT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE FOUR KILLERS WITH KNIVES?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT A MEAN LITTLE KID WITH A PEASHOOTER?
MAX, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME WE GOT GOING?
Max: IN A MINUTE, 99.
MR.
GAFFER, I'VE NEVER ASKED ANYONE THIS BEFORE, BUT I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND GIVING ME YOUR AUTOGRAPH.
CERTAINLY.
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- NOW WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO SIGN?
- OH, RIGHT HERE.
OH.
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
COME ON, 99, I WANT TO GET HOME AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE.
- WHY, MAX?
- I WANT TO WRITE ALL THIS DOWN IN MY DIARY.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
YOUR MOVE, MAX.
CHIEF, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME I BEAT YOU AT CHESS?
YOU'VE NEVER BEATEN ME AT CHESS, MAX.
THAT LONG AGO, EH?
WELL, THAT SITUATION IS ABOUT TO BE REMEDIED.
YOU WALKED INTO A VERY CLEVERLY LAID TRAP, CHIEF.
NOW WATCH CAREFULLY.
I'M ABOUT TO EXECUTE A FANTASTIC MANEUVER.
AFTER THIS MOVE, THE GAME WILL BE OVER.
- CHECKMATE.
- JUST AS I PREDICTED.
THE GAME IS OVER.
COFFEE AND ROLLS, GENTLEMEN?
OH, YES.
THANK YOU, DEVONSHIRE.
ACTUALLY, THAT WASN'T THE MOVE I HAD IN MIND.
THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CHOP YOU JUST-- DON'T DRINK THAT COFFEE.
WAITER.
HEY, YOU!
COME BACK HERE.
- HE GOT AWAY.
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENED, DEVONSHIRE?
I SAW THAT SCOUNDREL POUR SOMETHING INTO YOUR COFFEE, CHIEF.
ARE YOU SURE?
DEVONSHIRE, I'M SURE YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.
JUST IN CASE, CHIEF, BETTER LET ME TASTE IT.
NO, WAIT A MINUTE, MAX.
NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL STRONG COFFEE.
THAT WAS ACID.
DEVONSHIRE, YOU'VE SAVED MY LIFE.
HOW CAN I THANK YOU?
BY ACCEPTING MY MOST EMBARRASSED APOLOGIES, CHIEF.
TO THINK A THING LIKE THIS SHOULD HAPPEN AT THE REGENCY CLUB.
WAITER MAX, THAT LOOKS LIKE THE WORK OF KAOS.
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHIEF.
IT LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE OUT TO KILL YOU.
BUT DON'T WORRY.
FROM NOW ON, I'LL BE WITH YOU EVERY MINUTE, DAY AND NIGHT.
IN ORDER TO GET TO YOU, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KILL ME FIRST.
AW, THANK YOU, MAX.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
JUST AS I THOUGHT, IT'S TICKING.
THE OLD TIME-BOMB- IN-THE-ROLL TRICK.
STRANGE.
I COULD HAVE SWORN I HEARD IT TICKING.
YOU DID, MAX.
MY WATCH.
THAT'S FUNNY.
IT'S NOT TICKING NOW.
I DON'T MIND TELLING YOU, MAX, I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT A KAOS MAN WAS ABLE TO GET INTO THE REGENCY CLUB.
ME TOO, CHIEF.
IMAGINE, A PRIVATE CLUB LIKE THAT.
THERE'S NO TELLING WHERE THEY'LL BE ABLE TO INFILTRATE NEXT, MAYBE EVEN THE PENTAGON.
YOU'RE RIGHT, CHIEF.
BUT EVEN IF THEY DO GET A MAN INTO THE PENTAGON, THAT'S NOT SAYING HE'LL BE ABLE TO GET OUT.
I REMEMBER ONE OF OUR OWN AGENTS WAS LOST IN THERE FOR THREE DAYS.
THREE DAYS?
MAX, NO AGENT COULD BE THAT CONFUSED.
WELL, LET'S SEE NOW.
I WENT IN ON A FRIDAY - I CAME OUT ON-- - NEVER MIND, MAX.
WATCH THE PHONE, I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
HELLO, CHIEF.
MAX, I JUST HEARD WHAT HAPPENED AT THE REGENCY CLUB.
- I'M WORRIED.
- ME TOO, 99.
THE CHIEF IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE GUARDED DAY AND NIGHT.
WE CAN'T LET HIM OUT OF OUR SIGHT FOR ONE SINGLE MINUTE.
BUT MAX, YOU KNOW HOW HE HATES TO HAVE PEOPLE AROUND HIM CONSTANTLY.
I HAVE TO LEAVE THE BUILDING.
I'LL BE BACK SOON.
DOES HE AT LEAST HAVE A GUN TO PROTECT HIMSELF?
I DON'T KNOW, 99.
I'D BETTER CHECK AND FIND OUT.
RIGHT.
HERE, LET ME HELP YOU ON WITH YOUR COAT, CHIEF.
THANK YOU, MAX.
THERE YOU GO.
THANK YOU, GOODBYE.
BYE, CHIEF.
DOES HE HAVE A GUN?
- MM-HM.
- ARE YOU SURE?
POSITIVE, 99.
HERE IT IS.
MAX, NOW HE HAS NO WAY TO PROTECT HIMSELF AT ALL.
OH WELL, AT LEAST HE WON'T SHOOT HIMSELF ACCIDENTALLY.
MAX, I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE REGENCY CLUB.
DO YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR YOU AND THE CHIEF TO EXPOSE YOURSELF TO DANGER BY PLAYING CHESS THERE?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, 99.
THE REGENCY CLUB IS THE ONE PLACE THE CHIEF AND I WILL BE ABSOLUTELY SAFE.
BESIDES, THERE'S A GOOD MAN LOOKING OUT FOR US THERE.
- WHO'S THAT?
- GOOD OLD TRUSTWORTHY CEDRIC DEVONSHIRE.
"YOU THOUGHT"?
!
KAOS DOESN'T PAY YOU TO THINK.
YOU MEN WERE SENT HERE TO OBEY.
IT'S TAKEN ME YEARS TO GAIN MY POSITION OF TRUST AT THE REGENCY CLUB.
AND IT HAS PROVEN A VERITABLE STOCKPILE OF INFORMATION FOR KAOS.
IF THAT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL, IT WOULD HAVE RUINED EVERYTHING.
IT WAS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT HEADQUARTERS ISSUED ORDERS TO HAVE THE CHIEF OF CONTROL LIQUIDATED.
GENTLEMEN, THERE IS A PLAN IN THE WORKS TO ERADICATE BOTH THE CHIEF OF CONTROL AND MAXWELL SMART IN SUCH A WAY THAT THERE WILL BE NO LINK TO KAOS.
I HAVE JUST COMPLETED MY FINAL EXPERIMENT AND IT IS AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.
WHAT IS "IT"?
ALL IN DUE TIME, GENTLEMEN.
TOMORROW MORNING, I WANT MAXWELL SMART ABDUCTED AND BROUGHT TO ME ALIVE.
DON'T KILL HIM.
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE HIM ALIVE.
MAKE HIM USE UP HIS AMMUNITION.
HELLO, CONTROL?
Operator: What number are you calling?
I'M CALLING CONTROL, OPERATOR.
I cannot hear you clearly, sir.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, OPERATOR.
YOU SEE, I'M IN A RUNNING GUN BATTLE.
WAIT A MINUTE, I'LL PUT MY SILENCER ON.
IS THAT BETTER OPERATOR?
Yes, much better, sir.
Now, whom do you want?
I'M CALLING CONTROL, OPERATOR.
Control?
YES, A MASTER SPY ORGANIZATION HERE IN WASHINGTON, OPERATED BY THE FORCES OF GOOD IN THE FREE WORLD TO COMBAT THE FORCES OF EVIL AND TOTALITARIANISM.
Would you please spell that, sir?
C-O-N-- No, "totalitarianism".
OPERATOR, WOULD YOU PLEASE HURRY?
I'M IN GREAT DANGER.
One moment, please.
That number has been changed.
Have you a pencil?
OPERATOR, I'VE GOT A FANTASTIC MEMORY.
JUST GIVE ME THE NUMBER.
I'd prefer you to make a note of the numbers to avoid dialing incorrectly.
JUST A MINUTE.
I'VE GOT A PEN.
GO AHEAD, GIVE IT TO ME.
The number is 5-5-5-6-2-1-3.
What number are you dialing?
OPERATOR, I'M CALLING CONTROL.
You have dialed incorrectly.
Give me your name and address, and your dime will be refunded.
OPERATOR, I'M CALLING FROM MY SHOE.
What is the number of your shoe, sir?
IT'S AN UNLISTED SHOE, OPERATOR.
NEVER MIND.
- THAT'S IT.
- LET'S TAKE HIM.
Receptionist: CONTROL headquarters CONTROL headquarters.
SORRY, WRONG NUMBER.
GENTLEMEN I AM ABOUT TO ADMINISTER "IT".
THAT'S IT?
IT'S A BRAINWASHING PILL, THE END RESULT OF 15 YEARS OF PRIVATE RESEARCH.
KAOS spy: IT'S WORKING ALREADY.
MAXWELL SMART, AGENT 86 OF CONTROL, - DO YOU HEAR ME?
-  I HEAR YOU.
I'M ABOUT TO GIVE YOU CERTAIN COMMANDS WHICH YOU WILL CARRY OUT WITH BLIND OBEDIENCE WHEN YOU AWAKEN, THOUGH YOU WILL REMEMBER NOTHING OF THIS CONVERSATION.
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
I UNDERSTAND.
YOU WILL PLAY CHESS THIS EVENING AS USUAL WITH THE CHIEF OF CONTROL AT THE REGENCY CLUB.
I WILL PLAY CHESS THIS EVENING AS USUAL WITH THE CHIEF OF CONTROL AT THE REGENCY CLUB.
THE CHIEF WILL WIN, AS USUAL, WHEN HE WINS, HE WILL UTTER THE WORD "CHECKMATE".
"CHECKMATE" IS YOUR COMMAND WORD.
"CHECKMATE" IS MY COMMAND WORD.
WHEN YOU HEAR THE WORD "CHECKMATE," YOU WILL DRAW YOUR REVOLVER, TAKE CAREFUL AIM AND SHOOT TO KILL.
WHEN I HEAR THE WORD "CHECKMATE," I WILL DRAW MY REVOLVER, TAKE CAREFUL AIM - AND SHOOT TO KILL.
- GENTLEMEN, IT IS NOW HIGH NOON.
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THAT PILL WILL LAST FOR EXACTLY 12 HOURS, UNTIL MIDNIGHT.
SINCE SMART AND THE CHIEF BEGIN THEIR CHESS GAME BETWEEN 7:00 AND 8:00 TONIGHT, IT WILL GIVE US MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME.
BUT DEVONSHIRE, WHAT IF SMART WINS THE CHESS GAME?
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN MAXWELL SMART PLAY CHESS?
HE SHOULD BE COMING ROUND AT ANY MOMENT NOW.
IMAGINE THE SCANDAL WHEN THE TOP AGENT OF CONTROL KILLS HIS OWN CHIEF RIGHT UNDER THE NOSES OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AT THEIR VERY OWN CLUB.
IT WILL MEAN THE END OF CONTROL AS AN EFFECTIVE ORGANIZATION.
AND IT WILL MEAN THE END OF MAXWELL SMART HIMSELF, AS HE WILL BE TRIED AND EXECUTED FOR MURDER, AND ALL BECAUSE OF A LITTLE WHITE BRAINWASHING PILL.
-  - HE'S COMING TO.
YOU FOOL!
WE WANTED HIM TO USE THAT PHONE TO CALL CONTROL SO THEY CAN HELP HIM ESCAPE.
IT HAS TO LOOK AS THOUGH HE GOT AWAY ON HIS OWN - OR THE PLAN WON'T WORK.
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IF WE LET SMART GO, CONTROL WILL BE SUSPICIOUS AS TO WHY WE CAPTURED HIM AND THEN LET HIM WALK OUT FREE.
HE'S WAKING UP.
COME ON.
WE'VE GOT TO GET OUT HERE.
"SOUVENIR, KAOS CONVENTION, ATLANTIC CITY, 1923".
THIS MUST BE KAOS HEADQUARTERS.
THEY BROKE MY SHOE PHONE.
ASK HIM SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS CHIEF.
THAT WILL MAKE HIM THINK WE KIDNAPPED HIM JUST TO GET INFORMATION.
THEN FIND SOME WAY TO GIVE HIM THESE KEYS AND LET HIM ESCAPE.
BUT WON'T THAT MAKE HIM SUSPICIOUS?
NOT IF YOU PLAY YOUR CARDS RIGHT.
FORTUNATELY, MAXWELL SMART CONSIDERS HIMSELF QUITE THE LADIES' MAN.
WELL HELLO THERE.
HELLO THERE.
UH, YOU MAY CALL ME SHIRLEY, MR.
SMART.
I SEE YOU KNOW MY NAME.
ALL KAOS AGENTS KNOW THE NAME OF THE FAMOUS MAXWELL SMART.
TELL ME, MR.
SMART-- YOU CAN CALL ME MAX.
TELL ME, MAX WHERE DOES YOUR CHIEF GO ON WEDNESDAY NIGHTS?
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL HAVE TO BE A LITTLE MORE SPECIFIC THAN THAT, SHIRLEY.
- WHAT WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
- HOW ABOUT NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT?
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
THAT'S CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT, MAXIE?
MAYBE WE COULD DO IT TOGETHER.
I'M AFRAID NOT.
YOU SEE I'M GUARDING THE CHIEF AT A CONCERT NEXT WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
HOW ABOUT ANOTHER NIGHT THEN, MAXIE, AT YOUR PLACE?
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M NOT ALLOWED TO HAVE ANY KAOS AGENTS AT MY PLACE.
HOW ABOUT YOUR PLACE?
HERE'S MY PHONE NUMBER.
AND HERE ARE THE KEYS TO THE CELL.
CALL ME WHEN YOU ESCAPE.
GOODBYE, MAXIE.
IT GETS EASIER ALL THE TIME.
HE THREW THOSE KEYS OUT THE WINDOW.
GET DOWNSTAIRS AND RETRIEVE THEM.
SHIRLEY, GET BACK IN THERE.
NOW WHY DID YOU THROW THOSE KEYS AWAY?
ARE YOU KIDDING?
YOU DIDN'T REALLY EXPECT ME TO FALL - FOR THE OLDEST TRICK IN THE WORLD, DID YOU?
- WHAT TRICK?
I PUT THE KEY IN THE LOCK AND PFFFT,  TAKE THAT TRAY OF FOOD IN TO HIM, THEN TURN YOUR BACK.
LET HIM OVERPOWER YOU SO HE CAN ESCAPE.
IT'S MY LUNCH.
PERHAPS YOU WOULD RATHER DO WITHOUT LUNCH PERMANENTLY?
YOUR LUNCH, MR.
SMART.
MMM.
THAT SMELLS DELICIOUS.
I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND TASTING THAT FOR ME?
NOT AT ALL.
TASTES ALL RIGHT TO ME.
OH, GO AHEAD, HAVE ANOTHER BITE.
SURE, THANKS.
-  - WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?
BECAUSE THAT'S THE SECOND OLDEST TRICK IN THE WORLD.
- WHAT IS?
- WELL, YOU TASTE THE FOOD, GO NEXT DOOR AND TAKE AN ANTIDOTE FOR THE POISON YOU JUST SWALLOWED AND I'M LEFT HERE TO DIE LIKE A DOG.
NO, THANK YOU.
YOU GET IN THERE AND HELP HIM ESCAPE.
- HOW?
- HOW?
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
USE YOUR INGENUITY.
MAYBE IF WE ALL JUST WENT IN THERE AND SURRENDERED.
GET IN THERE.
- ALL RIGHT, MISTER-- - I DON'TKNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT-- OKAY, MR.
SMART.
YOU GOT ME COVERED.
THIS?
BUT THIS IS ONLY A FINGER.
YOU CAN'T FOOL ME, MR.
SMART.
THAT'S A FINGER GUN, A GUN THAT LOOKS LIKE A FINGER.
NO, IT ISN'T.
LOOK, IT'S ONLY A FINGER.
YOU'RE RIGHT, MR.
SMART.
IT'S ONLY A FINGER.
COME ON, SMART.
USE THAT FABULOUS BRAIN OF YOURS.
THERE MUST BE A WAY OUT OF HERE.
HE'S TRYING TO DIG HIS WAY OUT THROUGH THE CONCRETE WITH A SPOON.
THAT WILL TAKE HIM SEVEN YEARS TO ESCAPE.
GET IN THERE AND HELP HIM.
- HOW?
- HOW?
I DON'T KNOW HOW.
TAKE HIM FOR A RIDE AND LET HIM ESCAPE, ANYTHING.
BUT GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
HMM.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT 86.
I WAS SUPPOSED TO MEET HIM HOURS AGO AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY.
MAX, YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.
- JUST BARELY.
- Chief: WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN, MAX?
CHIEF, YOU WON'T BELIEVE IT.
YOU JUST WON'T BELIEVE IT.
THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING HAPPENED TO ME.
I WAS JUMPED BY TWO KAOS AGENTS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT IN AN ALLEY, RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS, TAKEN TO KAOS HEADQUARTERS, INTERROGATED UNMERCIFULLY ABOUT YOUR ACTIVITIES-- WITHOUT REVEALING A THING, CHIEF-- THEN I MADE THE MOST FANTASTIC ESCAPE WITH THE USE OF KARATE AND JUMPING FROM A MOVING CAR.
MAX, THAT SOUNDS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE.
OH?
WHICH PART, CHIEF?
MAYBE I COULD CHANGE IT.
MAX, IF YOU WERE IN KAOS HEADQUARTERS, THEN YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO TELL US WHERE IT'S LOCATED.
EH YES.
WELL, AS A MATTER OF FACT, 99, I-- AS A MATTER OF FACT WHAT?
WELL, CHIEF, YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT OUT HERE IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS?
AFTER ALL, IT IS TOP SECRET.
I DEMAND THE CONE OF SILENCE.
- MAX, DO WE HAVE TO?
- OF COURSE, WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION LIKE THIS.
ALL RIGHT, THE CONE OF SILENCE.
WELL, MAX?
WHAT, CHIEF?
WHERE IS IT?
WHAT?
HEADQUARTERS.
HEADQUARTERS?
KAOS.
OH, KAOS.
I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHIEF?
WHAT'S THE MATTER, DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT ECHO?
DIDN'T I HEAR WHAT?
ECHO ECHO ECHO!
OH YES.
I HEARD IT THAT TIME.
LET'S HOPE THE CHIEF SAYS THE FATAL WORD "CHECKMATE" QUICKLY.
THAT PILL IS DUE TO LOSE IT'S EFFECTIVENESS AT 12:00.
OKAY.
WE'LL WAIT OUTSIDE.
IF WE DON'T HEAR A SHOT BY 12:00, WE'LL KNOW SOMETHING'S GONE WRONG.
WE'LL COME BACK IN AND TAKE CARE OF IT OUR WAY.
NOTHING CAN GO WRONG.
IT BETTER NOT.
NOW YOU TWO GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE SMART SEES YOU.
- GOOD EVENING, CHIEF.
- EVENING.
SMART.
YOUR TABLE IS ALL READY.
GOOD.
THANK YOU.
HAVE AN ENJOYABLE GAME, GENTLEMEN.
THANK YOU, DEVONSHIRE.
- YOU READY, MAX?
- NOT QUITE, CHIEF.
OH, I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT YOU HAD IN THAT PACKAGE.
AFTER THE LAST TIME YOU BEAT ME, I DECIDED TO TAKE POSITIVE ACTION.
"HOW TO PLAY CHESS IN SIX EASY LESSONS"?
YES, WRITTEN BY AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHAMPION, AND SO SIMPLE EVEN A CHILD CAN UNDERSTAND IT.
YOUR MOVE, MAX.
DON'T RUSH ME, CHIEF.
"CHESS IS A VERY EASY GAME TO LEARN.
IN THIS BOOK YOU WILL FIND ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW TO PLAY, TO ENJOY THE GAME AND TO HOLD YOUR OWN AGAINST OTHER FRIENDS WHO PLAY CHESS".
STILL YOUR MOVE, MAX.
CONGRATULATIONS.
IT'S ONLY BEEN AND ALREADY YOU'VE MADE YOUR FIRST MOVE.
I WAS NOT AWARE, SIR, THAT SPEEDY PLAY WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN THE FINAL DECISION OF A GAME OF CHESS.
IT ISN'T, 86.
THE ONLY THING THAT CONCERNS ME IS THAT I'M NOT A YOUNG MAN.
YOUR MOVE.
IT'S YOUR MOVE, MAX.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHIEF?
WORRIED?
AFRAID I'M GOING TO WIN MY FIRST GAME?
NO, I'M AFRAID THIS IS GOING TO BE MY LAST GAME.
MOVE, YOU FOOL.
MAKE A MOVE.
I COULD MOVE MY KNIGHT HERE OR MY QUEEN THERE.
NO.
AREN'T YOUR EYES GETTING TIRED FROM SO MUCH READING, MAX?
OH, HERE'S AN INTERESTING CHAPTER, CHIEF.
"HOW TO WEAR DOWN YOUR OPPONENT".
WE COULD FINISH THE GAME BY MAIL.
DO YOU MIND, CHIEF?
PLEASE DEVONSHIRE, THIS IS ONE GAME I'D LIKE TO WIN WITHOUT ANY HELP.
THAT'S PERFECTLY ALL RIGHT, MAX.
GET ALL THE HELP YOU CAN.
AHA.
JUST AS I THOUGHT.
AFTER THIS MOVE, YOU'LL BE IN A TRAP FROM WHICH YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO EXTRICATE YOURSELF.
GOOD, WHEN YOU SAY THAT, I ALWAYS KNOW I'M ABOUT TO WIN.
- THANK YOU, MAX, THAT'S-- - CHECKMATE!
YOU JUST SHOT DEVONSHIRE!
WHAT FOR?
I DON'T KNOW, CHIEF.
BUT BELIEVE ME, I'D BETTER HAVE A DARNED GOOD REASON.
IN OTHER WORDS, CHIEF, USING THEIR DIABOLICAL BRAINWASHING PILL, KAOS PROGRAMMED ME TO SHOOT YOU - THE MINUTE YOU SAID THE FATAL WORD.
- PRECISELY.
WHEN DEVONSHIRE FORGOT HIMSELF AND SAID THE WORD FIRST, YOU WERE MERELY REACTING TO THE COMMAND GIVEN YOU EARLIER.
MAX, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW SORRY I AM ABOUT DOUBTING YOUR STORY.
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, CHIEF, WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.
SAY, CHIEF, I GOT A GOOD IDEA.
WHY DON'T WE PLAY A LITTLE GAME OF CHINESE CHECKERS JUST TO UNWIND?
FINE.
ANY GAME AT ALL, SO LONG AS IT DOESN'T END WITH THE WORD "CHECKMATE".
MAX!
UH, SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
THERE'S NOTHING HARDER TO SHAKE THAN A BAD HABIT.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
I'M SORRY, I MADE A MISTAKE - COULD YOU START OVER AGAIN, PLEASE?
- 99: ALL RIGHT, MAX.
- WHO IS IT?
- IT'S ME, MAX.
COME IN, 99.
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE USING THE WRONG CODE.
- THERE'S A NEW CODE OUT.
- OH, I DIDN'T GET ONE YET.
YES.
YOU SEE, WHEN YOU COME IN THE DOOR, - YOU KNOCK LIKE THIS--  - THEN WHAT DO YOU DO?
- I SAY "COME IN".
- OH.
- HOW IS HE?
- NO IMPROVEMENT YET.
SINCE HE'S BEEN RELIEVED OF ACTIVE DUTY, HE'S BEEN VERY VERY DEPRESSED.
AFTER ALL, HE'S USED TO BEING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THE ACTION.
YES, AND NOW LOOK AT HIM-- JUST LIES AROUND ALL DAY, NEVER MOVES, JUST STAYS BY THAT CABINET.
CAN'T BLAME HIM, MAX.
FANG'S USED TO BEING TOP DOG.
JUST LOOK AT THIS, 99.
HE HASN'T TOUCHED ONE SPECK OF HIS FOOD.
MAYBE HE DOESN'T LIKE THE FOOD YOU'RE FEEDING HIM.
THAT CAN'T BE.
HE HAD THE SAME THING FOR DINNER I DID.
- WHAT'S THAT?
- DOG FOOD.
WELL, I RAN OUT OF EVERYTHING ELSE.
GEE, I WISH THERE WAS SOME WAY WE COULD GET FANG BACK ON ACTIVE DUTY.
SO DO I. I KNOW HE'S BORED WITH THAT DESK JOB CONTROL GAVE HIM.
YES.
I DON'T BLAME HIM.
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SIT AROUND CHECKING IN EVIDENCE AND THEN BURYING IT?
MAX, REMEMBER AGENT 73?
HE HAD THE SAME PROBLEM.
- HE WAS BURYING EVIDENCE?
- NO, MAX.
HIS DOG WAS RETIRED SO HE SENT HIM TO A KENNEL - TO HAVE HIM REHABILITATED.
- OH, YES.
I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.
I ASKED 73 TO CALL ME AS SOON AS HE CAME BACK IN.
- GOOD.
-  NO, NOT THAT PHONE, 99.
IT'S THE SECRET AGENT'S HOTLINE.
I'LL GET IT.
- HELLO, THIS IS 86.
- This is 73.
I JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE.
I WAS OUT TO THE KENNEL PICKING UP MY DOG.
YES, THAT'S WHAT I CALLED YOU ABOUT, 73.
NOW, CAN YOU GIVE ME THE NAME OF THAT DOG KENNEL?
- SURE.
THE NAME OF THAT KENNEL IS-- -  JUST A SECOND, SMART.
- GET THIS DOWN, 99.
- RIGHT.
-  - WHAT'S THE MATTER, BOY?
-  - Help!
Help!
SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A KENNEL CALLED "HELP HELP".
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, CHIEF?
- SHH, I'M TRYING TO KILL A BEE.
IS HE CARRYING A GUN?
- NO, MAX.
- I'LL GET IT, CHIEF.
MAX, I DON'T THINK IT WILL BOTHER US UP THERE.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT BEE GOT INTO THE BUILDING.
I THINK IT'S AN ENEMY BEE, CHIEF.
- AN ENEMY BEE?
!
- RIGHT.
HE'S PROBABLY CARRYING A TRANSISTOR AND RECORDING THIS CONVERSATION RIGHT NOW.
I THINK IT MAY BE A BUGGED BUG.
MAX, DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
- HERE'S THE FILE YOU WANTED, CHIEF.
- THANKS, 99.
THAT BEE UP THERE?
YES.
CAN YOU SEE ANY CONTROL MARKINGS ON IT?
NOT FROM HERE, MAX.
WHY?
I'VE GOT A FEELING HE'S NOT ONE OF OURS.
JUST AS I THOUGHT, IT ALL TIES IN.
HE WAS MURDERED BY HIS OWN DOG.
- MURDERED?
!
- YES.
YOU SEE, 73 WAS RETURNING FROM OUR NEW YORK BRANCH.
HE WAS BRINGING BACK A REPORT ON KAOS ACTIVITIES.
NOW APPARENTLY TO PICK UP HIS DOG - AS SOON AS HE LANDED.
- I DON'T GET THE TIE-UP, CHIEF.
IT'S ALL IN HERE.
THIS FILE CONTAINS A LIST OF RECENT DEATHS WE ORIGINALLY THOUGHT WERE ACCIDENTS.
LOOK, GENERAL FOGLESBY-- KILLED BY HIS HUNTING DOGS.
ADMIRAL KIRKWOOD KILLED BY HIS CHOW DOG.
DR.
KRAUTMEYER KILLED BY HIS DACHSHUND.
- BY HIS DACHSHUND?
!
- WHILE HE WAS SLEEPING.
ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT KAOS HAS A MEANS FOR CONTROLLING ANIMALS?
PRECISELY.
AND PRACTICALLY EVERY IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL OWNS SOME KIND OF PET.
THEN THAT MEANS WHOEVER CONTROLS THOSE ANIMALS LITERALLY HOLDS A GUN ON WASHINGTON.
BUT WHERE DO WE BEGIN, CHIEF?
- AT THE WASHINGTON ANIMAL SPA.
- 99: I'VE HEARD OF THAT.
THAT'S A VERY HIGH-CLASS KENNEL.
YES, IT IS.
AND EVERY ONE OF THE PEOPLE ON THIS LIST-- INCLUDING AGENT 73-- SENT HIS DOG TO THAT KENNEL.
I'M GONNA ISSUE AN URGENT DISPATCH TELLING ALL V.I.P.s TO STAY AWAY FROM THAT KENNEL UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE, CHIEF.
VERY GOOD, 99.
NOW, MAX, I HAVE AN IDEA THAT I THINK MAY WORK.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
SHOULDN'T WE DISCUSS THIS UNDER THE CONE OF SILENCE?
THE CONE OF SILENCE?
MAX, IT'S NOT FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.
- WELL, THIS IS CONFIDENTIAL, ISN'T IT, CHIEF?
- YES, MAX.
THE CONTROL MANUAL STATES EMPHATICALLY THAT WE SHOULD USE THE CONE OF SILENCE.
ALL RIGHT, MAX, THE CONE OF SILENCE.
-  -  NOW, HERE'S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO.
-  - HERE'S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO.
WHAT, CHIEF?
I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
THERE'S A BUZZING IN MY EARS.
OF COURSE THERE'S A BUZZING IN YOUR EARS.
THAT'S BECAUSE THAT BEE IS IN HERE WITH US.
I TOLD YOU IT WAS AN ENEMY BEE, CHIEF.
IT'S IN HERE GATHERING INFORMATION.
- MAX, RAISE THE CONE OF SILENCE.
-  - IT'S NOT WORKING, CHIEF.
- I TOLD YOU IT WASN'T FUNCTIONING PROPERLY.
- I THINK I KNOW WHY, CHIEF.
- WHY?
IT'S NOT WORKING.
- MAX, DO SOMETHING BEFORE THE BEE STINGS US!
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- I'LL USE MY SPECIAL LIGHTER.
- NO, THAT USES POISON GAS!
- BUT IT'LL KILL THE BEE.
- BUT IT WILL ALSO KILL US!
OH RIGHT, CHIEF.
NO, MAX!
DON'T SHOOT!
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT, CHIEF.
WATCH-- HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT, CHIEF?
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.
I GOT THE BEE AND FIXED THE CONE OF SILENCE ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
WELL, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN, CHIEF?
MAX, I WANNA PLANT ONE OF OUR ANIMAL AGENTS IN THAT KENNEL.
WE'VE GOT TO FIND OUT HOW KAOS IS CONTROLLING THOSE ANIMALS AND PREVENTING THEM FROM EVER USING THAT METHOD AGAIN.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
AND I KNOW JUST THE DOG TO INFILTRATE-- FANG.
OH, MAX, I HAD TO PUT FANG ON THE INACTIVE LIST.
LET'S GO DOWN AND LOOK AT SOME OTHER DOGS.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH FANG?
MAX, FANG JUST DOESN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE.
"DOESN'T HAVE IT ANYMORE"?
WHY, FANG IS JUST AS COMPETENT AS I AM!
I KNOW.
- WHERE'RE THE OTHERS?
- I'M SORRY, CHIEF, BUT ALL OUR OTHER DOG AGENTS ARE OUT ON ASSIGNMENTS.
NONE OF THESE SEEM TO HAVE ENOUGH EXPERIENCE FOR THE JOB.
WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE ON THE END?
YOU DIDN'T GIVE ME HIS BACKGROUND.
- YOU CAN'T USE HIM, CHIEF.
- WHY NOT?
HE'S A TRAINING-SCHOOL DROPOUT.
HE JUST HANGS AROUND HERE.
- ALL RIGHT, MEN, TAKE THEM OUT.
-  WELL, CHIEF, I GUESS THAT JUST LEAVES FANG.
OH NO, MAX.
I TOLD YOU, FANG IS OUT.
SMART, HE DIDN'T DO TOO WELL ON HIS LAST CASE.
"DIDN'T DO TOO--" LOOK, CHIEF, EVERYBODY IS ENTITLED TO ONE MISTAKE.
I'VE PROBABLY MADE ONE MYSELF.
FANG HAS THE EXPERIENCE FOR THIS JOB.
NOT ONLY IS HE A DEDICATED AGENT, BUT HE'S THE FASTEST DOG WE'VE GOT.
WHY, DO YOU KNOW THAT FANG CAN SIT UP AND LIE DOWN FASTER THAN ANY DOG IN CONTROL?
GO AHEAD, FANG, SHOW HIM.
GO!
- WANNA SEE IT AGAIN, CHIEF?
- "AGAIN"?
I DIDN'T SEE IT THE FIRST TIME.
SEE HOW FAST HE IS?
COME ON, CHIEF, GIVE HIM A BREAK.
ALL RIGHT, MAX.
I'LL PUT FANG ON THIS ASSIGNMENT, BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU WANT HIM SO MUCH.
THANK YOU, CHIEF.
WELL, BOY, YOU'RE BACK IN ACTION AGAIN.
- OH, THIS IS GONNA BE A GOOD ONE, FANG.
-  WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PUT THIS COLLAR ON FANG.
THERE'S A MINI TELEVISION TRANSMITTER IN THIS COLLAR AND ONCE FANG GETS INTO THE WASHINGTON ANIMAL SPA, YOU CAN WATCH THE WHOLE THING ON A PORTABLE MONITOR IN YOUR APARTMENT.
NOW THIS BUTTON TURNS THE TRANSMITTER ON AND THIS BUTTON TURNS THE TRANSMITTER OFF.
- WHAT'S THIS BUTTON FOR?
- COLOR.
CARLETON, WE'LL BE IN TROUBLE IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG WITH THAT TRANSMITTER.
OH, NOTHING WILL, CHIEF.
BUT JUST IN CASE, YOU CAN ALWAYS SEND ALONG AGENT B-17.
GOOD IDEA.
- MAX, YOU'D BETTER GET STARTED.
- ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.
I THINK I'LL USE THE COVER NAME "STANLEY MAXWELL" INSTEAD OF "MAXWELL SMART".
- UH, CHIEF, DO I HAVE TO TAKE HIM ALONG?
- NO, 99 CAN BRING HIM.
GEE WHIZ, CHIEF, I DON'T SEE WHY WE NEED A BIRD AGENT ON THIS CASE ANYWAY.
MAX, HE'S AN EXPERT AT IMITATING VOICES, AND HE REPEATS EVERYTHING HE'S HEARD.
NOW IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG WITH THE TRANSMITTER, HE CAN TELL US WHAT HE'S HEARD.
MAYBE SMART IS AFRAID THAT B-17 WILL SHOW UP FANG.
"SHOW UP FANG"?
HUH!
- WOULD YOU BELIEVE-- -  WOULD YOU BELIEVE?
WOULD YOU BELIEVE?
-  - DID YOU HEAR THAT, CHIEF?
THAT'S THE WORST IMPRESSION I EVER HEARD.
YES.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
WE'RE LEAVING TOWN FOR A FEW DAYS AND WE'D LIKE TO LEAVE OUR DOG AND OUR PARROT HERE.
UH-HUH.
AND THIS IS YOUR DOG, HUH?
- GOOD GUESS.
- REALLY?
UM, NAME, PLEASE?
- FANG.
- ALL RIGHT.
MR.
AND MRS.
FANG.
NOW HOW LONG-- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THE DOG'S NAME IS FANG.
OH, I SEE.
YOUR NAME, PLEASE.
MR.
AND MRS.
STANLEY MAXWELL.
ALL RIGHT, MR.
MAXWELL.
HOW ABOUT A BATH?
NO, I THINK I'LL WAIT TILL I GET HOME FOR THAT.
FOR THE DOG, MR.
MAXWELL.
NO, THE DOG HAS A BAD COLD.
I SEE.
THE COLLAR.
GOODBYE, FANG, OLD BOY.
WILL THAT BE ALL?
- THAT'S ALL.
- TAKE GOOD CARE OF THEM.
- WE WILL.
- BYE-BYE, PAULIE.
-  - WHO WAS THAT MAN?
HE LOOKED FAMILIAR.
I DON'T KNOW HIM.
HE SAID HIS NAME WAS STANLEY MAXWELL.
"STANLEY MAXWELL COVER NAME INSTEAD OF MAXWELL SMART-- MAXWELL SMART".
IT'S BEEN OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE GOT A PICTURE FROM THE TELEVISION UNIT ON FANG'S COLLAR.
IT COULD BE DUE TO TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES, MAX.
WE SENT ALONG B-17 TO COVER US IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS.
HE'LL BE ABLE TO REPEAT EVERYTHING HE HEARD.
YES WELL, I THINK WE MADE A MISTAKE THERE, CHIEF.
WE SHOULD HAVE SENT ALONG A PARROT THAT CAN MAKE TELEVISION REPAIRS.
I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WAIT.
THERE'S NO TIME TO WAIT, 99.
THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE!
FANG IS IN TROUBLE.
I CAN FEEL IT.
I KNOW IT!
AND I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR HIM BEING ON THIS ASSIGNMENT.
CHIEF, YOU GOTTA LET ME GO IN AFTER HIM.
NO, MAX.
IF YOU SHOULD BE CAPTURED ATTEMPTING TO RESCUE FANG, THEY'D KNOW CONTROL WAS ONTO THEM.
OUR MISSION WOULD BE A TOTAL LOSS.
THE PICTURE WILL BE ON ANY MOMENT.
- AND WHAT IF IT ISN'T?
- I'M SORRY, MAX.
I'M GOING BACK TO THE OFFICE.
AND NO RESCUE ATTEMPT-- THAT'S AN ORDER!
- 99, I'VE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.
- MAX I KNOW, I KNOW, I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GO IN AND RESCUE HIM.
BUT LET'S LOOK AT IT THIS WAY, 99: WHAT IF IT WAS THE CHIEF WHO WAS CAPTURED AND I KNEW WHERE HE WAS BEING HELD?
YOU'D GO IN AFTER HIM.
SO I'VE JUST GOTTA TRY AND THINK OF FANG AS A SMALL FURRY MIDDLE-AGED MAN.
BUT, MAX, YOU HAVE YOUR ORDERS.
BUT I CAN'T JUST STAY HERE AND DO NOTHING,99.
EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF FANG.
LOOK-- THIS FOOD BOWL WITH HIS NAME ON IT-- "FANG".
MY SLIPPER THAT HE USED TO LOVE TO CHEW ON.
HIS TURTLENECK SWEATER HIS LEAD CHAIN HIS FAVORITE TOY DUCK.
I'M GOING IN AFTER HIM.
- MAX, YOU CAN'T.
- WHY NOT?
NOT WITHOUT ME.
NOW A LITTLE TWIST THERE.
AND A LITTLE TWIST THERE.
IT'S A GOOD THING CARLETON WAS IN THE LAB SO HE COULD GIVE US THIS ELECTRO-BLAST DEVICE.
I NEVER WORKED WITH ONE BEFORE, MAX.
YOU MERELY PRESS DOWN ON THIS ELECTRONIC PLUNGER WHICH SENDS AN ELECTRICAL CURRENT THROUGH THESE WIRES WHICH SETS OFF THE NITRO UNDER THESE SUCTION CUPS WHICH MUFFLE THE SOUND OF THE EXPLOSION.
- AND THAT DOES IT?
- YES, GUARANTEED ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO OPEN DOORS.
ANOTHER GOOD WAY IS TURNING THE DOORKNOB.
ONE MOVE AND IT WILL BE YOUR LAST.
TAKE THEIR GUNS.
WELCOME, MAXWELL SMART.
YOU ARE NO MATCH FOR THE BRILLIANCE OF KAOS.
YOU'VE FALLEN INTO OUR VERY CLEVER TRAP.
HMM, I'VE FALLEN INTO CLEVERER TRAPS THAN THIS BEFORE.
WE PURPOSELY BLACKED OUT YOUR DOG'S TELEVISION COLLAR UNIT, KNOWING THAT YOU COULD NOT RESIST MAKING A RESCUE ATTEMPT.
AND NOW NOW YOU ARE MY PRISONER.
IT WON'T DO YOU ANY GOOD.
YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING OUT OF HIM, NOT EVEN IF YOU BEAT HIM, WHIP HIM AND KICK HIM.
UH, THAT'S RIGHT.
GO AHEAD-- BEAT ME, WHIP ME, KICK ME.
HOW ABOUT STRIPS OF BAMBOO SHOVED UNDER YOUR FINGERNAILS?
THAT I'M NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT.
WE DON'T WANT INFORMATION FROM YOU, MR.
SMART.
WE WANT YOU AS LIVE BAIT.
JUST AS YOU CAME LOYALLY AFTER YOUR DOG, SO WILL YOUR CHIEF COME LOYALLY AFTER YOU.
KAOS IS EXTREMELY CLEVER.
THEY MUST HAVE SET A TRAP FOR HIM.
NOW SMART IS IN TROUBLE, I CAN FEEL IT.
BUT, CHIEF, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO.
I JUST CAN'T WAIT AROUND HERE.
EVERYTHING REMINDS ME OF MAX, LOOK-- HIS SWEATER  MY TIE HE ALWAYS LIKE TO WEAR HIS COURIER CHAIN.
HIS FAVORITE TOY DUCK GUN.
JUST LIKE MAX.
IF I TOLD HIM ONCE, I TOLD HIM A THOUSAND TIMES-- "MAX, NEVER LEAVE YOUR DUCK LOADED".
I'M GOING IN AFTER HIM.
THAT'S FINE.
YOUR CHIEF SHOULD BE HERE ANY MINUTE NOW.
IT'S BEEN A HALF HOUR SINCE YOU CAPTURED US.
THE CHIEF HASN'T COME TO RESCUE US YET.
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME.
LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU.
AT LEAST THERE'S ONE PERSON IN CONTROL WHO DOESN'T HAVE AN OUNCE OF LOYALTY IN HIM.
I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOUR CHIEF IS EVERY BIT AS LOYAL AS YOU ARE.
WHY WON'T YOU TELL US WHAT HAPPENED TO FANG?
I'VE BEEN SAVING THAT AS A SURPRISE.
FANG!
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HIM?
YOUR DOG HAS BEEN UNDERGOING TREATMENT.
-  - THAT MACHINE IS A CANINE BRAIN-WASHER.
ONCE SUBJECTED TO IT, ANY ANIMAL FALLS COMPLETELY UNDER MY CONTROL.
THINK OF IT-- ALL THE IMPORTANT DOGS IN WASHINGTON UNDER MY CONTROL, AND ALL OF THEM READY TO TURN ON THEIR MASTERS AT MY COMMAND.
GREG?
ANOTHER LITTLE SURPRISE.
TELL THEM.
THIS IS AN AUDIO-SENSITIVE, HIGH-INTENSITY EXPLOSIVE APPARATUS, SET TO EXPLODE AT THE SOUND OF A DOG BARKING-- YOUR DOG.
ACTIVATE IT.
-  -  PUT IT DOWN.
WE WILL NOW TAKE THE ELEVATOR TO THE CELLAR.
WHEN YOUR CHIEF ARRIVES, I WILL SIGNAL YOUR DOG.
HE WILL THEN BARK, AND WHEN HE DOES-- PFFT!
- JUST A MINUTE!
- YES?
- THERE'S ONE THING YOU OVERLOOKED.
- OH?
YOU SEE, YOU CAN'T LEAVE US ALONE IN THIS ROOM.
- AND WHY NOT?
- BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU'RE GONE, BY THE USE OF SHEER BRUTE STRENGTH, I SHALL BE ABLE TO RIP THESE CHAINS FROM THE WALL IN ONE MINUTE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
- ONE MINUTE.
- I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
-  - WOULD YOU BELIEVE TWO MINUTES?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT A WEEK FROM TUESDAY?
YOU HAVE A MARVELOUS SENSE OF HUMOR.
YOU'LL PROBABLY DIE LAUGHING.
MAX, I'M SURE THAT KAOS MAN IS RIGHT ABOUT THE CHIEF.
HE'S PROBABLY ON HIS WAY OVER HERE RIGHT NOW.
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- DON'T PANIC, 99.
DON'T PANIC.
NOW LET'S TRY AND THINK OF THIS THING WITH A NICE CLEAR COOL HEAD.
NOW NUMBER ONE, WE'RE CHAINED AGAINST A WALL.
NUMBER TWO, WE'RE JUST OUT OF REACH OF THE BOMB.
NUMBER THREE, WHEN THE CHIEF COMES, THAT KAOS MAN IS GONNA MAKE FANG BARK AND EXPLODE THE BOMB AND BLOW US ALL SKY-HIGH.
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING WE CAN DO.
- WHAT IS IT?
- PANIC.
- MAX, WE'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING.
HMM, THERE'S RIGHT, WE CAN'T JUST LET THE CHIEF BE KILLED.
WAIT A MINUTE!
MAYBE THE ANSWER LIES IN SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID.
WHEN THE CHIEF COMES, FANG WILL BE SIGNALED TO BARK - AND THE BOMB WILL EXPLODE-- - WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.
I'VE GOT A PLAN, 99, I'VE GOT A PLAN.
IF WE CAN GET FANG TO BARK NOW, THEN THE BOMB WILL EXPLODE BEFORE THE CHIEF COMES.
THEN YOU AND FANG AND I WILL BE BLOWN TO BITS.
- I HAVE AN ALTERNATE PLAN.
- NO, MAX!
- WE'VE GOT TO DO IT, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
- IT'S ONLY DECENT, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
AFTER ALL, THE CHIEF'S LIFE'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN OURS, RIGHT?
- RIGHT?
- DON'T RUSH ME, 99.
RIGHT.
MAX, LOOK!
LISTEN, 99, HE'S GIVING FANG VOICE COMMANDS FROM DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.
AND HE'S OPENED THE DOOR TO THE SHAFT AUTOMATICALLY SO FANG COULD HEAR HIM.
- THAT'S IT, 99.
- YOU HAVE ANOTHER PLAN, MAX?
YES, AND I'M CERTAIN THAT THIS ONE WILL WORK.
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT, AND THEN WHEN FANG BARKS, IT WILL DESTROY THEM.
THAT'S BRILLIANT, MAX!
HOW DO WE PUT THE BOMB IN THE SHAFT?
"HOW DO WE PUT THE BOMB IN THE SHAFT," YES.
WELL, THAT'S THE PART OF THE PLAN I HAVEN'T WORKED OUT YET.
-  - THAT'S IT!
RIGHT.
THAT'S WHAT?
THAT'S HOW WE DO IT-- IF YOU CAN IMITATE HIS VOICE, YOU CAN COMMAND FANG TO DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE SHAFT.
BUT HOW CAN I IMITATE A PARROT?
NO, MAX, YOU IMITATE THE KAOS MAN'S VOICE.
- LIKE THE PARROT'S DOING.
- BUT HE SPEAKS GERMAN, - I DON'T KNOW ANY GERMAN.
- I DO.
YOU DO?
WELL, HOW DO YOU SAY "PICK UP THE BOMB"?
- NIMM DIE BOMBE!
- NIMM DIE BOMBE!
FANG, NIMM DIE BOMBE!
- NIMM DIE BOMBE!
-  Chief: MAX, 99, ARE YOU IN THERE?
IT'S THE CHIEF.
HE'S HERE.
HURRY!
HOW DO YOU SAY "DROP THE BOMB DOWN THE ELEVATOR SHAFT"?
LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT.
LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT.
FANG, LASS FALLEN DIE BOMBE IN DEN SCHAFT.
- HOW DO YOU SAY "BARK"?
- BELL!
FANG, BELL!
FANG, "HITEN THE DIRTEN".
GO DOWN TO THE BASEMENT.
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YEAH, WE'RE OKAY, CHIEF.
- FANG SAVED US.
- FANG, KOMMEN SIE HER AND SITTEN DOWNEN!
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, MAX?
YES, CHIEF, AND FANG DOESN'T UNDERSTAND GERMAN ANYMORE.
THE EXPLOSION MUST'VE RELEASED HIS MIND.
- BETTER TEST HIM, MAX.
- RIGHT, 99.
FANG, LIE DOWN, FANG.
LIE DOWN.
BEG, FANG.
BEG!
BEG, FANG.
HOW ABOUT THAT, CHIEF?
JUST AS GOOD AS NEW.
THERE YOU GO.
SORRY ABOUT THIS, CHIEF.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, MAX.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO APOLOGIZE TO ME FOR BREAKING ORDERS.
I UNDERSTAND.
MAX, WHAT'S FANG'S DUCK DOING HERE?
THAT'S NOT FANG'S DUCK, MAX.
THAT'S YOUR SPECIAL GUN.
WHEN I REALIZED I'D TAKEN IT FROM YOUR OFFICE, I PUT IT IN MY POCKET.
I MUST HAVE DROPPED IT.
- SOMEONE BETTER TELL FANG!
-  NOW YOU KNOW WHY I PUT HIM ON A DESK JOB.
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
I'LL HAVE HIM REPORT FIRST THING IN THE MORNING FOR TARGET PRACTICE.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
HELLO, THIS IS THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
COME IN, CONTROL.
HELLO, CONTROL?
THIS IS MAXWELL SMART.
NO, SMART.
"S" AS IN SPLENDID, "M AS IN MARVELOUS, "A" AS IN-- THAT'S RIGHT, SMART.
HELLO.
WHO?
I-I DON'T GET YOU.
MAYBE YOU'D BETTER SPELL IT.
"C" AS IN CHARLIE, "H" AS IN HARRY, "I" AS IN CHIEF.
OH, CHIEF, THIS IS SMART.
UH, "S" AS IN SPLENDID OKAY, GO AHEAD, CHIEF.
Max, I want you to report to headquarters, pick up a suitcase, and meet me at the airport.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
UH, WHERE AM I GOING?
To the airport.
I KNOW THAT, CHIEF, BUT WHERE ARE YOU SENDING ME?
To the airport!
WHY DON'T WE START FROM THE BEGINNING.
YOU WANT ME TO GO TO HEADQUARTERS-- Max, report to Professor Parker.
He'll give you a suitcase that's been made up especially as a cover for you to act as a passenger.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
I'M ON MY WAY.
And, Max, make sure you're not followed.
If KAOS gets on your trail-- DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
I'M PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE OF MYSELF.
- THIS YOUR CAR?
- YES, SIR.
NEXT TIME PUT A NICKEL IN THE METER.
SORRY ABOUT THIS, OFFICER.
BUT YOU SEE, I WAS IN KIND OF A HURRY.
YEAH YEAH.
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAY.
SEE, THESE TWO KAOS AGENTS WERE AFTER ME.
THAT'S NO EXCUSE FOR CARELESSNESS.
THEY WERE TRYING TO KILL ME.
LOOK, WE ALL GOT OUR PROBLEMS, MISTER.
JUST BE MORE CAREFUL NEXT TIME.
YES, SIR.
THANK YOU.
DON'T THANK ME.
I'M JUST TRYING TO DO MY JOB.
ALL RIGHT, MISS, YOU CAN GO.
LISTEN CAREFULLY, MAX.
WE ONLY HAVE A COUPLE OF MINUTES.
CHIEF, YOU'D BETTER CHECK THROUGH MY SUITCASE.
- THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOKING OVER THIS WAY.
- ALL RIGHT.
IN JUST A FEW MINUTES A KAOS AGENT WILL BE GETTING OFF THAT PLANE THAT JUST LANDED.
HE'LL BE CARRYING A SUITCASE LIKE THIS.
I WANT YOU TO SWITCH SUITCASES WHILE 99 DISTRACTS THE KAOS MAN.
THEN I'LL TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CONTENTS, AND WE'LL SWITCH THE SUITCASES BACK AGAIN.
- DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS?
- MY DUTY IS TO OBEY ORDERS, CHIEF, NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS.
- GOOD.
- WHY ARE WE DOING THIS, CHIEF?
IN THE PAST FEW DAYS, A STEADY FLOW OF KAOS MEN HAVE BEEN COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY FROM EUROPE, SOUTH AMERICA, EVERYWHERE.
THEY'RE ALL WEARING DARK SUITS AND CARRYING SUITCASES LIKE THIS.
WELL, MAYBE IT'S A CONVENTION.
MAX, WE WANT TO GET A LOOK INTO ONE OF THE SUITCASES WITHOUT THEIR KNOWLEDGE.
THAT'S A GOOD PLAN, CHIEF, EXCEPT FOR ONE THING-- HOW DO WE KNOW WHO THE REAL KAOS AGENT IS?
AFTER ALL, THERE'LL BE A LOT OF MEN IN DARK SUITS WITH SUITCASES ON THAT PLANE.
AGENT 44 IS SOMEWHERE IN THE AIRPORT.
HE'LL IDENTIFY THE KAOS MAN.
- YOU'RE NOT DOING YOUR JOB, CHIEF.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WELL, A GOOD CUSTOMS INSPECTOR WOULD HAVE LOOKED IN MY SOCKS.
THEY'RE LOOKING, CHIEF.
INCIDENTALLY, CHIEF, RIGHT AFTER I TALKED TO YOU I WAS ATTACKED BY A COUPLE OF KAOS AGENTS.
YES, I KNOW.
WE PICKED THEM UP A FEW MINUTES AGO.
DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY CONNECTION WITH THAT ATTEMPT ON MY LIFE AND THIS CASE?
WE DON'T KNOW.
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO TALK TO THEM TILL THEY LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.
ONE OF THEM WAS A VERY CARELESS DRIVER.
ALL SET, SIR.
CHIEF, YOU FORGOT TO CHECK FOR A FALSE BOTTOM OR SECRET COMPARTMENTS.
- THERE'S NO FALSE BOTTOM IN THIS.
- THEY'RE LOOKING.
ALL RIGHT.
THERE YOU ARE, SIR.
ALL SET.
"ALL SET".
SURE, IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY ALL SET AFTER YOU'VE MESSED AND TORN AND RIPPED EVERYTHING IN MY SUITCASE!
YOU CUSTOMS INSPECTORS ARE ALL ALIKE!
NO WONDER GUYS LIKE ME DON'T LIKE TO TRAVEL.
HOPE I'M NOT OUT OF LINE, CHIEF.
- MAX!
- JUST DOING A LITTLE ACTING, CHIEF.
INCIDENTALLY, YOU DID A NICE JOB YOURSELF.
BY THE WAY, CHIEF, WHERE'S AGENT 44?
RIGHT HERE.
- AGENT 44?
- THAT'S RIGHT.
INSPECT ME.
THAT'S THE KAOS MAN-- THE ONE WITH THE HAT.
- MAY I SEE YOUR BAG, SIR?
- I HAVE DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY.
THESE ARE MY CREDENTIALS.
THANK YOU, SIR.
I'LL LOOK AT THEM OVER HERE.
- EXCUSE ME, SIR.
WERE YOU ON FLIGHT 32?
- YES, I WAS.
OH, GOOD.
WE'RE TAKING A LITTLE SURVEY OF OUR PASSENGERS TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE'S SATISFIED AND I WONDER IF YOU'D MIND ANSWERING A FEW QUESTIONS.
- WELL, I - I'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT SO MUCH IF YOU WOULD.
- YES, ALL RIGHT.
- GOOD.
WELL, HERE'S THE LIST, AND THIS IS A LIST OF THE FOOD AND WINE THAT WE HAVE.
IF YOU'D JUST CHECK OFF THE THINGS THAT YOU'D LIKE TO HAVE WHEN YOU TRAVEL WITH US AGAIN - YES.
- AND DOWN HERE WE HAVE OUR IMPORTED OR DOMESTIC WINE.
- LOOK, MAX.
- WHAT IS IT, CHIEF?
SOME SORT OF METAL SOMETHING.
PUT IT DOWN.
I'LL TAKE A COUPLE PICTURES OF IT.
QUICK, PUT IT BACK AND TAKE IT BACK TO HIM.
- YOUR PAPERS SEEM TO BE IN ORDER, SIR.
- I KNOW THEY ARE.
I SHALL COMPLAIN TO MY GOVERNMENT ABOUT THIS INTOLERABLE TREATMENT.
- I SAID, TAKE THE SUITCASE BACK!
- I CAN'T, CHIEF.
MY TIE IS STUCK IN THE SUITCASE AND THE LOCKS ARE JAMMED.
- WELL, CUT IT OFF!
- ARE YOU KIDDING?
THIS IS A $6 TIE!
MAX, HE'S ABOUT TO LEAVE.
NOW, HURRY UP.
COME ON.
- WILL THAT BE ALL, MISS?
- THERE'S ONE OTHER THING I WANTED TO ASK YOU ABOUT.
I'M SORRY, BUT I MUST BE LEAVING NOW.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN THERE?
UH, WOULD YOU BELIEVE, A JOLSON MEDLEY?
- DROP IT!
- DON'T MOVE OR SMART GETS IT.
THAT'S RIGHT.
DON'T MOVE OR SMART GETS IT.
- YOU'RE COMING WITH US!
- NO!
WELL, WHAT IS IT, PARKER?
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S SOME METAL ALLOY.
MACHINE-TOOLED, HAND-FINISHED.
I'D SAY FROM THESE GROOVES AND THIS BEVELED EDGE THAT IT FITS INTO SOMETHING.
- THEN YOU MEAN IT COULD BE PART OF SOME LARGER MACHINE.
- THAT'S RIGHT.
WELL, PARKER, WHAT ARE THESE NUMBERS HERE ON THE SIDE?
- ONE, TWO, SEVEN.
- MAYBE THAT'S A PART NUMBER.
THEN EACH KAOS AGENT IS BRINGING IN A PART OF SOME LARGER OBJECT, SOME MACHINE OR WEAPON, AND THAT IS PART NUMBER 127.
MAX, BRING IN THAT KAOS AGENT.
- WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET ANYTHING ELSE OUT OF HIM.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
PARKER, TAKE THAT BACK AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT IT.
OKAY.
I DON'T THINK WE'LL GET ANYTHING OUT OF THAT KAOS AGENT, CHIEF.
WE'VE GOT TO, 99.
WE MUST FIND OUT WHERE THOSE MEN ARE ASSEMBLING AND WHAT THAT MACHINE IS.
YOU WILL GET NOTHING OUT OF ME, MR.
SMART.
KAOS TRAINS ITS MEN WELL.
I CAN TAKE THREATS, TORTURE, STARVATION.
- HOW ABOUT YOU?
- WELL, I CAN TAKE THREATS AND STARVATION.
TORTURE I'M NOT TOO CRAZY ABOUT.
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TELL US EVERYTHING YOU KNOW.
WE'LL GET IT OUT OF YOU SOONER OR LATER.
I WILL TELL YOU NOTHING.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL US ANYTHING.
YOU SEE, I'VE FIGURED IT ALL OUT BY A MATTER OF SIMPLE DEDUCTION.
- REALLY?
- YES.
YOU SEE, THERE ARE SEVERAL HUNDRED KAOS AGENTS, EACH CARRYING A NUMBERED PART TO A CERTAIN LOCATION.
NOW, WHEN YOU PUT THIS MACHINE TOGETHER EACH ONE OF YOU WILL LEAVE THE COUNTRY CARRYING AN EMPTY SUITCASE.
ALL 300 OF YOU.
GOOD WORK, MAX!
YOU STILL DO NOT KNOW ONE VITAL PIECE OF INFORMATION-- THAT IS WHERE WE ARE ALL ASSEMBLING.
THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE WRONG.
JUDGING BY YOUR TIME OF YOUR ARRIVAL, THE POINTS OF ENTRY OF THE OTHER KAOS AGENTS AND YOUR METHODS OF TRANSPORTATION, I WOULD SAY THAT YOUR MEETING PLACE WOULD BE IN - LITTLETON, NEW HAMPSHIRE.
- YOU'RE DEAD WRONG.
WELL, IT MAY NOT BE RIGHT IN LITTLETON, NEW HAMPSHIRE, BUT IT'S RIGHT OUTSIDE OF IT.
AND I AM TELLING YOU THAT LITTLETON, NEW HAMPSHIRE, IS NO PLACE NEAR BLUE MIST MOUNTAIN.
BLUE MIST MOUNTAIN.
I THINK I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.
I REMEMBER THAT FROM A SECURITY BRIEFING, CHIEF.
THAT'S RIGHT NEXT TO THE P.D.Q. MISSILE BASE.
- THAT'S A TOP-SECRET BASE, ISN'T IT, CHIEF?
- RIGHT.
WE'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE AND FIND OUT WHAT THOSE KAOS MEN ARE DOING.
OH, I COULD JUST KILL MYSELF.
AND GET THREE TICKETS ON THIS AFTERNOON'S FLIGHT TO BLUE MIST MOUNTAIN.
UH, CHIEF, IF WE WAIT UNTIL MONDAY WE CAN FLY AT HALF FARE.
- THIS AFTERNOON, 99.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
SEE ANYTHING, CHIEF?
YES, THEIR CABIN IS RIGHT DOWN THERE ABOUT HALF A MILE.
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
AH, YES.
I SEE IT.
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
- WHAT?
ONE OF THE KAOS AGENTS IS COMING OUT OF THE CABIN NOW.
DOES HE HAVE A SUITCASE WITH HIM?
NO.
TAKE A LOOK, 99.
I WONDER HOW MANY OF THE 338 KAOS AGENTS HAVE DELIVERED THEIR PARTS.
WE HAVE PART 127, AND THAT'S OUR KEY TO GET IN AND LOOK AROUND.
- ARE YOU READY, MAX?
- ALL READY, CHIEF.
- 99.
- RIGHT, MAX.
NOW REMEMBER, MAX, YOU'RE A KAOS AGENT.
FIND OUT ALL YOU CAN, BUT DON'T AROUSE THEIR SUSPICIONS AND REPORT BACK TO ME IMMEDIATELY.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- BEFORE YOU GO, WOULD YOU LET ME HAVE YOUR SHOE PHONE?
I WANT TO CALL THE GENERAL AND SEE IF HE'S MOVED THE TROOPS UP.
THANK YOU.
HELLO, GENERAL CRAWFORD, THIS IS THE CHIEF.
HAVE YOU GOT YOUR MEN DEPLOYED?
GOOD.
DON'T MOVE THEM IN ANY FURTHER THAN THREE MILES.
WE WANT TO CATCH THEM OFF-GUARD.
IF YOU WANT TO CHECK BACK WITH ME, THE NUMBER HERE MAX, WHAT'S THE NUMBER ON YOUR SHOE PHONE-- THE PRIVATE NUMBER?
- 306, CHIEF.
- THE NUMBER IS 306.
RIGHT.
OVER AND OUT.
NOW, REMEMBER, MAX, BE CAREFUL.
THESE MEN WILL NOT HESITATE TO KILL YOU.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
- 99?
- YES, MAX?
JUST IN CASE SOMETHING HAPPENS AND I DON'T MAKE IT BACK, TAKE CARE OF THE CHIEF.
RIGHT, MAX.
- OH, AND 99?
- YES, MAX?
- LOOK AFTER FANG.
- I WILL, MAX.
AND THE PLANTS IN MY APARTMENT SHOULD BE WATERED ABOUT ONCE A WEEK-- MAX!
WHERE'S 127?
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T GET HERE?
HE'LL BE HERE.
HE HAS TO BE.
WHO IS IT?
Max: KAOS AGENT 127 REPORTING.
GIVE ME THIS.
THIS IS IT-- THE LAST PIECE.
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG, 127?
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE AN HOUR AGO.
UH WELL, I THINK I WAS BEING FOLLOWED.
FOLLOWED?
THAT DOESN'T GIVE US MUCH TIME.
WE'LL SET IT FOR MIDNIGHT.
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT?
UH, I MEAN, ISN'T THAT A LITTLE EARLY?
YOU, OUT!
YOU'VE GOT 10 MINUTES TO GET OUT OF THE AREA BEFORE THIS THING GOES OFF.
-  - WHAT WAS THAT?
- UH -  UH, MUST BE YOUR PHONE.
- WE HAVEN'T GOT A PHONE.
- HOW ABOUT YOUR ALARM CLOCK?
THERE'S NO ALARM CLOCK HERE.
OH.
WELL, I GUESS IT WAS A WRONG NUMBER.
BUT WE TOLD YOU WE DON'T HAVE A PHONE.
WELL, YOU'D BETTER GET ONE.
AS LONG AS YOU'VE GOT THE RINGING, - YOU MIGHT AS WELL HAVE THE PHONE, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
CHIEF, THE BOMB IS SET TO GO OFF AT MIDNIGHT.
THEY GAVE ME 10 MINUTES TO GET OUT OF THE AREA.
- MIDNIGHT?
THAT'S IN SEVEN MINUTES.
- WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER PARTS?
MINE WAS THE LAST PART.
THEY WERE WAITING FOR.
- THAT'S IT!
OF COURSE!
- WHAT?
A NUCLEAR EXPLOSION HERE ON THE SITE OF ONE OF OUR GOVERNMENT'S MISSILE BASES.
THE REST OF THE WORLD WILL THINK THE UNITED STATES HAS EXPLODED A NUCLEAR DEVICE AND BROKEN THE TEST BAN.
KAOS MUST HAVE BEEN PAID TO DO THIS.
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THEM.
-  - THAT MUST BE THE GENERAL.
OH.
YES, HE CALLED ME WHILE I WAS OVER AT THE KAOS CABIN.
THIS IS THE CHIEF.
NO, GENERAL, MOVE YOUR TROOPS BACK.
WE'VE GOT TO GET THEM OUT OF THE AREA.
THERE'S NO TIME TO EXPLAIN.
MAX, DRAW A PICTURE OF THE CABIN FAST.
WE'RE GOING IN OURSELVES, GENERAL.
WE'VE ONLY GOT SIX MINUTES.
OVER AND OUT.
WE HAVE GOT TO FIND THAT BOMB OURSELVES AND DEACTIVATE IT.
LET ME SEE THE MAP.
THERE'S A DOOR HERE, CHIEF, AND A DOOR HERE.
- AND THEN THERE'S A WINDOW OVER HERE.
- WHAT ARE THOSE THREE THINGS?
THIS IS ME AND THIS IS YOU AND THIS IS 99.
- NOT THIS CABIN, MAX!
THAT CABIN!
- OH, THAT CABIN.
NEVER MIND, MAX.
THERE JUST ISN'T TIME.
HOW MANY DOORS DOES IT HAVE?
WELL, THERE'S AN EAST DOOR AND A WEST DOOR.
OKAY, YOU TAKE THE EAST DOOR AND BREAK IN, I'LL TAKE THE WEST DOOR AND BREAK IN.
- 99, YOU COME THROUGH THE WINDOW.
- RIGHT.
WHEN I GIVE THE SIGNAL OF THREE WHISTLES, - WE'LL ALL BURST IN, RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
- RIGHT?
- RIGHT.
IT'S SET TO GO OFF IN FOUR MINUTES.
COME ON.
THE HELICOPTER'S READY TO PICK US UP AT THE CLEARING.
- WHAT IS THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.
YOU TAKE THAT DOOR, YOU TAKE THAT DOOR.
-  -  - MAX, WHAT HAPPENED?
- I DON'T KNOW, 99, - BUT AT LEAST WE GOT TWO OF THEM.
- HOW?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
THE CHIEF WAS GOING THAT WAY AND I WAS I THINK THEY SHOT EACH OTHER.
-  - WHERE'S THE CHIEF?
I DON'T KNOW.
HE WENT PAST ME SO FAST, I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CHANCE TO SAY HELLO.
- OH, HELLO, CHIEF.
- CHIEF!
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- IT'S JUST A FLESH WOUND, BUT HE GOT AWAY.
- I'LL GET HIM.
- NO!
WAIT WAIT.
SOMEWHERE IN THIS ROOM THERE'S A BOMB THAT'S GONNA EXPLODE IN THREE MINUTES.
- WE'VE GOT TO FIND IT.
- THREE MINUTES?
WELL, THAT DOESN'T GIVE US TOO MUCH TIME, CHIEF-- JUST ABOUT 30 SECONDS TO FIND IT.
- WHAT ARE THE OTHER TWO AND A HALF MINUTES FOR?
- RUNNING.
MAX, WE COULDN'T HAVE TIME TO LEAVE THE AREA.
WE'VE GOT TO FIND THE BOMB.
MAYBE PROFESSOR PARKER MIGHT KNOW WHERE IT COULD BE HIDDEN.
- CONTACT HIM IMMEDIATELY.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
THIS IS 86 CALLING CONTROL.
COME IN, CONTROL.
UH, PUT ME THROUGH TO PROFESSOR PARKER.
PARKER, THIS IS 86.
HELLO, 86.
WHERE ARE YOU?
WE'RE IN A CABIN ON TOP OF BLUE MIST MOUNTAIN.
BLUE MIST MOUNTAIN?
YES.
IT'S REALLY LOVELY UP HERE, PARKER.
NICE PINE TREES-- - MAX!
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
LISTEN, PARKER, ONE OF THE KAOS AGENTS ESCAPED, BUT HE LEFT A BOMB HERE THAT'S SET TO GO OFF AT MIDNIGHT.
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?
- WELL, FRANKLY, THAT'S WHY WE CALLED YOU, PARKER.
- WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS.
- YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS?
WELL, WE THOUGHT YOU MIGHT HAVE SOME IDEA OF HOW IT COULD BE CAMOUFLAGED.
DESCRIBE EVERYTHING IN THE ROOM.
LET'S SEE, PROFESSOR.
IT'S A TYPICAL EARLY-AMERICAN  COUCH, CHAIR, SOFA, TABLES, TV SET, AND A HIDDEN ATOMIC BOMB.
WAIT A MINUTE, MAX.
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
DON'T MOVE.
-  - DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING TICKING?
YES, I DO, CHIEF.
AND FROM THE FREQUENCY OF THE NOISE AND ITS VOLUME AND FROM THE FACT THAT YOU'RE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO IT, I WOULD SAY IT WAS THIS CLOCK.
- OPEN THE FACE OF THE CLOCK.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
THE FACE DOESN'T OPEN, CHIEF.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S A CATCH HERE.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, CHIEF?
I'VE GOT A FEELING THIS IS NO ORDINARY CLOCK.
- MAX, WE ONLY HAVE TWO AND A HALF MINUTES.
- Hello, 86.
- Hello.
Do you see it?
- YES, PROFESSOR.
IT'S BUILT INTO THE WALL.
- FIND A SCREWDRIVER.
- A SCREWDRIVER.
RIGHT, PROFESSOR.
UH, CHIEF, DID I LEND YOU MY SCREWDRIVER?
- NO!
- I DON'T HAVE A SCREWDRIVER, PROFESSOR.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT YOU CAN USE?
WHAT DO I HAVE?
HOLD THIS, CHIEF.
UH, UH WAIT A MINUTE.
AH.
I HAVE A DIME.
THAT'S BETTER THAN A SCREWDRIVER.
YOU CAN'T MAKE A PHONE CALL WITH A SCREWDRIVER.
TWO MINUTES, MAX!
OKAY OKAY, NOW THERE SHOULD BE A DOOR TO THE CASING.
- OPEN IT!
- RIGHT.
- ONE MINUTE, 50 SECONDS.
- GO TO IT, MAX.
REMOVE THE FLANGE FROM THE PLUTONIUM STRIP.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?
YES, I'M FAMILIAR WITH THE WORD REMOVE.
SMART, THE URANIUM OR PLUTONIUM SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF A BALL ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SOFTBALL.
REACH IN WITH YOUR HAND AND FEEL AROUND.
- REACH IN WITH MY BARE HAND?
- Yes!
IT'LL BE ON THE END OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A LONG STEEL GUN BARREL.
DO I HAVE TIME TO PUT MY GLOVES ON?
- Hurry up, Smart!
- ONE MINUTE, MAX!
Do you see the control box connected to the barrel?
UH, I THINK SO.
YOU HAVE TO LOOSEN THE SCREW ON TOP OF THE BOX.
- I CAN DO THAT WITH MY DIME.
- QUICKLY, MAX!
NOW, RELAX.
DON'T GET EXCITED.
40 SECONDS!
I'M TURNING THE GOLD-TIPPED SCREW.
No!
No, no, no!
That's the trigger!
- THAT'S THE TRIGGER.
- I KNOW.
SMART, YOU HAVE TO LOOSEN THE HEXAGONAL BOLT RIGHT NEXT TO THE GOLD-TIPPED SCREW WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING ELSE.
How did you make out, Smart?
- I DROPPED MY DIME.
- Smart WELL, IF IT'S AT ALL LOOSE, USE YOUR FINGERS.
TURN IT, SMART!
Turn it!
HOW MUCH TIME DO I HAVE, 99?
DON'T TELL ME.
- EIGHT SECONDS.
-  Oh!
Oh, oh, you've ignited the mass!
- IT'S GOING OFF!
-  THAT'S NOT THE HALF OF IT.
MY TIE IS CAUGHT IN THIS THING!
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU DID IT, MAX, BUT YOU JUST SAVED THE EAST COAST.
MAYBE THE WHOLE WORLD.
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
- YOU DON'T KNOW HOW CLOSE IT WAS, CHIEF.
I WAS THINKING OF WEARING MY BOW TIE TODAY.
THIS IS SO DIFFERENT FROM OURS, I I'M REALLY NOT SURE ABOUT THIS.
- IT'S GONNA TAKE A LITTLE TIME.
- FINE.
FOUND THIS ONE WANDERING IN THE WOODS, CHIEF.
THIS IS THE LAST OF 'EM.
- WELL, CHIEF, NOW WE'VE CAPTURED ALL THE KAOS AGENTS.
- GOOD.
JUST THINK, CHIEF-- BOY, THAT'S REALLY GONNA PUT A DENT IN THE KAOS TRAINING PROGRAM.
EXCUSE ME, SMART.
WHEN YOU TRIED TO DEACTIVATE THIS, WHICH WAY DID YOU TURN THAT PLUTONIUM SCREW?
I'M NOT QUITE SURE, PROFESSOR PARKER.
WHY?
WELL, IF YOU TURNED IT TO THE LEFT IT DOESN'T MATTER, BUT IF YOU TURNED IT TO THE RIGHT YOU'VE DESTROYED THE SAFETY DEVICE.
IT CAN BE REACTIVATED BY-BY-- BY ANYTHING.
EVEN A LOUD NOISE.
COULD THE LOUD NOISE BE A GUNSHOT?
IT'LL GO OFF IN A MINUTE AND A HALF.
WHAT DO WE DO, PROFESSOR?
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
THIS IS RIGHT UP MY ALLEY.
- PROFESSOR, YOUR TIE, PLEASE.
- WHAT?
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
-  -    BUT, CHIEF, I'M TELLING YOU 99 HAD NO RIGHT TO SHOOT AT ME.
SHE COULD HAVE HIT ME.
DRAWING YOUR GUN ON THAT KAOS AGENT.
- BUT, CHIEF-- - IT WAS YOUR JOB TO FOLLOW THAT MAN NOT TO APPREHEND HIM.
IT'S A GOOD THING I HAD 99 AND 56 THERE TO BACK YOU UP.
- I'M SORRY I HAD TO DO IT, MAX.
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, 9-- BACKING ME UP TOO?
YES, MAX, AND 56 IS STILL FOLLOWING THAT KAOS AGENT.
THAT AGENT IS OUR ONLY LEAD TO THEIR NUMBER-ONE MAN, THE MAN IN CHARGE OF KAOS'S DATA SMUGGLING OPERATION.
YOUR MAN WAS NUMBER THREE.
HE WOULD LEAD US TO NUMBER TWO.
AND NUMBER TWO WOULD LEAD US TO NUMBER ONE.
HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN FOLLOWING THOSE AGENTS?
SINCE NUMBER 118.
MY GOSH, CHIEF, THAT SEEMS LIKE AN AWFUL WASTE OF TIME TO ME.
WHY DIDN'T WE JUST START OFF WITH NUMBER ONE?
MAX, THIS CHAIN IS PART OF A MASSIVE SMUGGLING OPERATION TO GET THE FORMULA OF THE TK-800 OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
- THE TK-800?
- RIGHT.
THE TK-800-- CHIEF, IF THEY EVER GET THE TK-800 OUT OF THE COUNTRY - WE'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
- UH-HUH.
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME.
- WHAT?
WHAT IS THE TK-800?
IT'S THE FORMULA FOR THE TRANQUILIZER BOMB.
WE THINK NUMBER THREE IS CARRYING THE FORMULA TO A HIGHER-UP.
- WHAT ABOUT THE MAP, CHIEF?
- WHAT MAP?
THIS CHART REPRESENTS THE MOVEMENTS OF ALL THE KAOS AGENTS FROM 118 TO NUMBER THREE.
WE THOUGHT IF WE COULD FIGURE OUT A PATTERN TO THEIR MOVEMENTS WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DEDUCE WHERE THEIR HEADQUARTERS IS.
-  - THAT MAY BE 56 REPORTING IN.
HELLO?
OH YES, 56, WHERE ARE YOU?
OH, I SEE.
HAS HE MADE CONTACT?
WELL, HANG ON TO HIM.
I'M SENDING 86 AND 99 TO TAKE OVER.
HE FOLLOWED NUMBER THREE TO THE AIRPORT.
YOU TWO WILL PICK HIM UP THERE.
MAX, ARE YOU LISTENING?
HUH?
OH, YES, CHIEF.
I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.
YOU SEE, THE POSITION OF ALL THESE KAOS AGENTS CAN BE EXPLAINED.
- ALL EXCEPT ONE.
- WHICH ONE IS THAT?
NOW WHAT'S THIS GUY DOING UP HERE IN MANITOBA?
HE WAS HOLDING THE MAP UP.
- 56?
- YES, 86.
- WHERE'S OUR SUBJECT?
- HE MADE CONTACT WITH ANOTHER MAN WEARING A LOUD SPORTS SHIRT.
THEY WENT INTO THE MEN'S LOUNGE ABOUT A MINUTE AGO.
ALL RIGHT, 56.
WHEN THEY COME OUT, YOU STAY WITH THE NUMBER-THREE MAN.
FOLLOW THE NEW ONE.
MAX, HERE THEY COME.
WAIT A MINUTE, 99.
- THERE'S SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THAT MAN.
- WHAT?
HE'S NOT WEARING A LOUD SPORTS SHIRT.
THE NUMBER-THREE MAN WAS WEARING THE LOUD SPORTS SHIRT.
FOR SOME REASON OR OTHER THEY EXCHANGED SHIRTS.
- COME ON - RIGHT.
THERE YOU ARE, SIR.
YOUR FLIGHT FOR SAN FRANCISCO IS LEAVING AT GATE NINE.
I THINK YOU CAN JUST MAKE IT.
YES, SIR?
- TWO TICKETS TO SAN FRANCISCO PLEASE.
- MM-HMM.
- FIRST CLASS OR TOURIST?
- TOURIST.
- DINNER FLIGHT OR SNACK FLIGHT?
- DINNER.
- SINGLE PLAN OR FAMILY PLAN?
- SINGLE.
WILL THAT BE CASH OR ADVANCED BILLING?
- CASH, AND PLEASE HURRY.
- Last call for flight 72 to San Francisco.
- ROUND TRIP OR ONE WAY?
- ROUND TRIP.
AND WHEN WILL YOU BE RETURNING?
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?
IT MAY NOT MATTER TO YOU BUT IT CERTAINLY MATTERS TO US.
LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU MAKE IT ANY TIME IT'S CONVENIENT FOR THE AIRLINE?
GOOD, I'LL LEAVE THAT OPEN.
MAX, WE'RE GONNA MISS THAT PLANE.
THAT'LL BE $609.42.
OH, BY THE WAY, THE MOVIE THAT YOU'LL BE SEEING IS "BRUNCH IN ACAPULCO".
- "BRUNCH IN ACAPULCO"?
- YES, STARRING GEORGE BRENNAN, JOAN BENNETT WITH EDWARD G. ROBINSON AND LYNN BARI IN SUPPORTING ROLES.
OH, AND JOAN BLONDELL AND CAB CALLOWAY MAKE CAMEO APPEARANCES.
- DOES THAT TAKE PLACE IN MEXICO?
- YES, IT DOES.
- I SAW IT, 99.
- MAX, THE PLANE.
PLEASE, 99, I'M TELLING YOU I SAW THE PICTURE AND IT WAS A BOMB.
EVEN JOAN BLONDELL COULDN'T SAVE IT.
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT?
ON THE FLIGHT TO SEATTLE CONNECTING TO SAN FRANCISCO WE HAVE A REAL WINNER-- "THE RETURN OF THE CISCO KID".
"THE RETURN OF THE CISCO KID"!
NOW THAT WAS A GREAT ONE, 99.
TELL ME, DOES GILBERT ROLAND PLAY THE CISCO KID?
- MAX!
- LET ME SEE.
NO NO NO, HE DOESN'T.
RAUL HERNANDEZ PLAYS THE CISCO KID.
UH-OH, I'M SORRY.
RAUL HERNANDEZ IS YOUR PILOT.
DON'T YOU HAVE ANYTHING WITH CARY GRANT IN IT?
- LET ME SEE.
- MAX, COME ON!
VERY GOOD.
IT APPEARS, BOBO, THAT OUR OLD ADVER-- OUR OLD ADVERSARY MAXWELL SMART HAS FALLEN INTO OUR TRAP.
HE DOES NOT REALIZE THAT HE IS WALKING INTO GREAT DANGER.
IT IS TRUE, MASTER.
I NEVER FLY IF I CAN AVOID IT.
NO, YOU MISUNDERSTAND ME, BOBO.
MR.
SMART FOLLOWS NUMBER TWO, LING HOW, HOPING TO BE LED TO ME.
BUT WHAT HE DOES NOT KNOW IS THAT DEATH AWAITS HIM AT THE END OF HIS ODYSSEY.
NOW HERE ARE YOUR ORDERS.
IT IS VERY SIMPLE.
GO TO THE TREMONT HOTEL.
WHEN LING HOW ARRIVES, KILL HIM.
GET THE SHIRT AND LEAVE THIS HALF LAUNDRY TICKET ON HIS BODY.
NOW DO YOU HAVE THAT, BOBO?
YES, MASTER.
JUST GIVE ME THE LAST PART AGAIN.
- WHICH PART?
- THE PART AFTER "IT'S VERY SIMPLE".
OH, BOBO.
INTERESTING.
HE WAS KILLED AND THEN PUT INTO THE CLOSET.
MOMENT, PLEASE.
SUPPOSE MURDERED MAN WAS KILLED WHILE HANGING UP COAT.
- WHO'S THAT?
- THAT'S HOO.
- WHO'S WHO?
- HE'S HOO.
OH, HE'S WHO.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
OH, MR.
SMART, THIS IS THE FAMOUS HAWAIIAN DETECTIVE, NOW SERVING WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE FORCE, INSPECTOR HARRY HOO.
OH, HE'S HOO.
HI, HOO.
IT CERTAINLY IS NICE TO MEET YOU, INSPECTOR HOO.
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOUR WORK.
YOU ARE TOO KIND, MR.
SMART.
HUMBLE MASTER DETECTIVE IS HONORED TO HELP YOU IN UNUSUAL CASE.
UH, WHAT BOTHERS ME ABOUT THIS CASE, INSPECTOR HOO, IS THE MOTIVE FOR THE MURDER.
OH, CORRECTION, PLEASE.
THIS IS NOT CASE OF MURDER, MR.
SMART.
THIS CASE OF ROBBERY.
ROBBERY?
THAT'S AMAZING.
BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY IT'S ROBBERY, MR.
HOO?
I MEAN, THE MAN WAS FOUND DEAD WITH $100 IN HIS WALLET.
HUMBLE BEG PARDON, MR.
SMART.
SUPPOSE VICTIM'S WALLET ORIGINALLY CONTAIN $101.
BY GEORGE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
OF COURSE, THEN THEY TOOK THE DOLLAR AND LEFT THE $100 TO THROW US OFF THE TRACK.
YOU ARE APT PUPIL, MR.
SMART.
YES, OF COURSE.
THEN THEY MURDERED HIM SO WE WOULDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THE ROBBERY.
IT IS WISELY WRITTEN, MR.
SMART, "DEAD MEN TELL NO TALES".
MR.
SMART, YOU ARE MAN OF SOME PERCEPTION.
WHAT DO YOU NOTICE ABOUT MAN ON FLOOR?
HE'S NOT BREATHING.
WHICH PRESENT TWO POSSIBILITY, MR.
SMART.
MAN HAS GONE TO VISIT HONORABLE ANCESTOR.
OR?
MAN VERY GOOD AT HOLDING BREATH.
DO YOU NOT NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE UNUSUAL, MR.
SMART?
NO, I DON'T THINK SO, MR.
HOO.
YOUR EYES SEE, MR.
SMART, BUT THEY DO NOT OBSERVE.
I DON'T THINK I FOLLOW YOU, MR.
HOO.
OBSERVE CLOSELY, MR.
SMART.
MURDERED MAN DRESSED IN BUSINESS SUIT.
GRAY JACKET AND PANTS, BLACK SOCKS AND SHOES, STRIPED NECKTIE, SILVER TIE CLASP.
HMM, LOOKS PRETTY GOOD.
THEN WHY, I ASK YOU, MR.
SMART, WHY IS HE NOT WEARING SHIRT?
BY GOLLY, YOU DON'T MISS A TRICK, DO YOU?
YOU KNOW, A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED THAT LITTLE DETAIL.
THAT IS WHY IT IS WISELY WRITTEN, MR.
SMART, "BIRD IN HAND GATHER NO MOSS".
AH SO.
IS IT A CLUE, HOO?
IT IS EVIDENCE LEFT BY MURDERER, MR.
SMART, - IT'S A BUTTON.
- WHICH PRESENT TWO POSSIBILITY.
VICTIM TORE BUTTON FROM MURDERER JACKET DURING STRUGGLE.
OR?
IT IS BUTTON FROM MY JACKET SLEEVE.
RIGHT.
TELL ME, MR.
HOO, DO ALL HAWAIIAN DETECTIVES WEAR WHITE SUITS?
NO, I BEGAN TO WEAR WHITE SUIT IN HAWAII WHEN I WAS EMPLOYEE OF ICE CREAM FIRM.
WELL, THEY'RE VERY ATTRACTIVE.
YOU SHOULD SEE MY CLEANING BILLS.
TELL ME, MR.
SMART, HOW YOU THINK MURDER WAS COMMITTED.
TWO POSSIBILITIES.
HE WAS KILLED BY A .
22-CALIBER PISTOL AT LONG RANGE BY A SHORT MAN WHO WAS A STRANGER TO HIM.
OR?
HE WAS KILLED AT CLOSE RANGE BY A KNIFE USED BY A WOMAN HE KNEW WHO WAS OVER SIX FEET TALL.
AMAZING.
AH SO.
YOU FOUND SOMETHING, MR.
HOO?
PERHAPS, MR.
SMART.
NOTICE PLEASE, ASHTRAY CONTAIN TWO CIGARETTES.
I SEE.
THEN THAT MEANS THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE HERE IN THE ROOM WITH THE VICTIM WHEN HE WAS KILLED.
PERHAPS EVEN THE MURDERER.
MOMENT PLEASE.
MOMENT PLEASE?
ONCE AGAIN WORTHY CONTROL AGENT LEAP TO OBVIOUS CONCLUSION.
IF VICTIM WERE NON-SMOKER COULD HAVE BEEN TWO SMOKERS IN ROOM WITH HIM.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
PERHAPS TWO SMOKERS AND ONE NON-SMOKER.
MOMENT PLEASE.
MOMENT PLEASE?
PERHAPS THERE WERE TWO SMOKERS AND TWO NON-SMOKERS.
PERHAPS TWO SMOKERS AND FOUR NON-SMOKERS.
THEN WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, MR.
HOO, IS THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AS MANY 50 PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM WITH THE VICTIM WHEN HE WAS KILLED.
PROVIDING ONLY TWO OF THEM WERE SMOKERS.
EXACTLY.
BOY, IT MUST HAVE BEEN PRETTY CROWDED IN HERE.
- MAX.
- OH, 99.
I TALKED TO ALL OF THE OTHER OCCUPANTS ON THE FLOOR AND THEY HEARD NO STRANGE NOISES, JUST THE USUAL RUNNING AND SHOOTING AND SCREAMING.
OH.
OH, 99, I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET MR.
HOO, THE FAMOUS HAWAIIAN DETECTIVE.
- HELLO.
- CHARMED.
HAVEN'T WE MET BEFORE IN HAWAII?
DO YOU LIKE ICE CREAM?
- NO.
- THEN I DON'T THINK WE'VE MET.
CHECK IN WITH CONTROL - AND TELL THEM WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE.
- RIGHT, MAX.
WE'RE GONNA REMOVE THE BODY, SIR.
UH, MOMENT PLEASE.
MUCH CAN BE LEARNED FROM MAN BY WHAT HE CARRY ON PERSON.
PLEASE TO EXAMINE POCKETS, MR.
SMART.
WALLET HANDKERCHIEF COMB KEYS TO MY APARTMENT.
ONE MOMENT, MR.
SMART.
VICTIM HAD KEY TO YOUR APARTMENT IN HIS POCKET?
OH.
YOU WANT ME TO SEARCH HIS POCKETS.
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING IN HIS POCKET BUT THIS HALF OF A LAUNDRY TICKET.
AH SO.
LAUNDRY TICKET TELL US SOMETHING.
PRESENT TWO POSSIBILITIES.
EITHER VICTIM WAS TRYING TO LOCATE MAN WITH OTHER HALF OF LAUNDRY TICKET, - OR-- - MOMENT PLEASE.
YOU MIND IF I TRY OTHER HALF OF POSSIBILITIES?
PLEASE TO DO SO.
OR VICTIM ONLY TOOK HALF HIS LAUNDRY TO THE CLEANERS.
AMAZING.
HAS WEAPON BEEN CLEARED FOR PRINTS?
THERE WERE NO PRINTS, SIR.
THE MURDERER MUST HAVE WORN GLOVES.
OH, THANK YOU.
YOU MAY TAKE BODY NOW.
MR.
SMART, IT WOULD BE MOST INSTRUCTIVE IF WE RECONSTRUCT CRIME.
WILL YOU ASSIST ME, PLEASE?
I'D BE MOST HAPPY TO, MR.
HOO.
JUDGING FROM ANGLE OF WOUND VICTIM WAS STANDING QUITE CLOSE TO ASSAILANT.
- LIKE SO.
- LIKE THIS.
I SUSPECT MURDERER WAS HOLDING KNIFE UP HIS SLEEVE.
LIKE THIS.
WHEN MURDERER WAS READY TO STRIKE - HE MERELY SLID OUT KNIFE - LIKE THIS.
- PULLED VICTIM CLOSE TO HIM WITH FREE ARM - LIKE THIS.
SEIZED THE KNIFE AND PLUNGED IT HOME.
LIKE THIS!
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
AMAZING.
MAX, ARE YOU SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT ONE?
ALL CHINESE LAUNDRIES LOOK ALIKE TO ME.
PLEASE, 99, THE ADDRESS WAS RIGHT ON THE BACK OF THE LAUNDRY TICKET WE FOUND ON THE BODY.
I'M NO HARRY HOO, BUT GIVE ME SOME CREDIT FOR SOME INTELLIGENCE.
WHERE IS HARRY HOO?
I THINK HE GOT A LITTLE IRRITATED WHEN I TORE HIS COAT.
I GUESS HE WENT HOME TO CHANGE.
HMM, THAT'S FUNNY, 99.
WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT SHIRTS IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY?
WELL, THESE LAUNDRY MARKS.
I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH A COMPLICATED SERIES OF NUMBERS ON A MAN'S SHIRT.
- YOU DON'T SUPPOSE - WHAT, MAX?
SO, IT'S OUR OLD FRIEND THE CRAW.
NOT THE CRAW.
THE CLAW!
- BOBO, TAKE THEIR WEAPONS.
- ONE MOVE AND I FIRE.
MR.
SMART, WHAT USE WOULD YOUR FLASHLIGHT BE AGAINST THIS?
AT LEAST I CAN SEE WHO'S KILLING ME.
IT'S IN HER PURSE.
The Claw: THANK YOU, MR.
SMART.
WELL, HOW DO YOU LIKE THIS, 99?
THE CRAW, ONE OF THE GREAT MASTER CRIMINALS OF ALL TIME WORKING IN A CHINESE LAUNDRY.
NO, MR.
SMART.
OPERATING A CHAIN OF CHINESE LAUNDRIES ACROSS THE NATION WHERE KAOS AGENTS RECEIVE AND PASS ON STOLEN INFORMATION.
A COMPLETE SPY NETWORK.
THE SPY NETWORK IS JUST A FRONT.
THE REAL MONEY IS IN THE LAUNDRY.
THE LESS HE KNOWS THE BETTER.
OF COURSE, MAX.
THE FORMULA FOR THE TRANQUILIZER BOMB IS IN THE LAUNDRY MARK.
EXACTLY.
WHERE NO IMMIGRATION OFFICER WOULD EVER LOOK.
THIS WAY, MR.
SMART.
THIS LAUNDRY IS THE END OF OUR PIPELINE.
AND NOW, MR.
SMART, YOU WILL TELL ME WHICH OF MY MEN IS KNOWN TO YOUR ORGANIZATION.
LIKE THE CARELESS LING HOW, HE MUST BE ELIMINATED.
YOU'RE WASTING YOUR TIME, CRAW.
YOU'LL NEVER GET ANYTHING OUT OF ME.
I THINK OUR MOST FITTING MEANS OF PERSUASION IS CLOSE AT HAND.
BOBO, THE PRESSING MACHINE.
SHOW HIM HOW IT WORKS, BOBO.
DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY?
NO STARCH, PLEASE.
BOBO, YOU MAY NOW PRESS MR.
SMART'S HEAD.
Hoo: MOMENT PLEASE.
OH, IT IS YOU, HOO.
WE MEET AGAIN, MR.
CRAW.
CLAW, NOT CRAW!
CLAW!
WELL, I SEE YOU TWO KNOW EACH OTHER.
HAVE FOLLOWED TRAIL OF THIS MAN FOR MANY YEARS.
HAVE COMPLETE FILE ON HIM LACKING IN ONLY ONE ITEM.
WHAT ITEM IS THAT?
COMPLETE SET OF FINGERPRINTS.
HOW DID YOU KNOW WE WERE HERE?
CALLED YOUR HOTEL AND GOT NO ANSWER.
HOW DID YOU KNOW TO LOOK FOR US HERE IN THE CHINESE LAUNDRY?
WAS NOT LOOKING FOR YOU.
ALWAYS BRING MY SHIRTS HERE.
AMAZING.
SO YOU SEE, MR.
HOO, THAT'S HOW THEY DID IT.
FIVE DIFFERENT KAOS AGENTS EACH CARRYING A SHIRT FROM A KAOS LAUNDRY NEAR THE PENTAGON.
AND EACH SHIRT CONTAINING A PART OF THE FORMULA.
IN THAT WAY NONE OF THE KAOS AGENT COULD GO INTO BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF.
IF YOU DON'T MIND, 99, - I'D LIKE TO TELL THIS IN MY OWN WAY.
- RIGHT, MAX.
YOU SEE, MR.
HOO, IN THAT WAY NONE OF THE KAOS AGENTS COULD GO INTO BUSINESS FOR HIMSELF.
ANYWAY, THE TERMINAL WAS ALWAYS HERE AT THE CRAW'S LAUNDRY.
FROM HERE THE DATA WOULD GO OVERSEAS.
BUT TELL ME, MR.
HOO, HOW DID YOU KNOW THIS WAS MORE THAN JUST A SIMPLE MURDER?
AH, IT IS TRULY WRITTEN, "EYES OF MIND NEVER SLEEP".
YOUR HONORABLE SERVANT OBSERVE TWO THINGS THAT WERE MOST SUGGESTIVE.
TWO POSSIBILITIES, EH?
WHAT WERE THEY, MR.
HOO?
FIRST, PORCELAIN CAT WAS MISSING FROM USUAL SPOT ON MANTELPIECE.
SECOND, GARDENER HAD TRIMMED MAGNOLIAS.
OF COURSE.
THE PORCELAIN CAT.
IT'S ALL SO SIMPLE.
WHAT PORCELAIN CAT?
SO SORRY, THAT WAS ANOTHER CASE.
IN THAT ONE GARDENER DID IT.
DON'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS GARDENER IN THIS CASE?
NO.
WELL, ANYWAY, MR.
HOO, YOU CAME JUST IN THE NICK OF TIME.
THE CRAW WAS ABOUT TO SUBJECT ME TO THIS.
AH YES, CHINESE STEAM-PRESS TORTURE.
FIENDISH BUT EFFECTIVE.
AH!
ALLOW ME TO OFFER OLD ORIENTAL SAYING--  UH, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I LOST MY CUFFLINK.
WAIT A MINUTE.
THERE'S ONE SURE WAY TO FIND A CUFFLINK.
- HOW?
- YOU TAKE THE OTHER CUFFLINK AND YOU DROP IT, AND IT'LL LAND IN THE SAME PLACE.
WELL, DID IT LAND IN THE SAME PLACE?
IT MUST HAVE.
NOW BOTH CUFFLINKS ARE LOST.
WILL YOU STOP CRAWLING AROUND?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE ACTING DIGNIFIED.
YOU'LL GIVE AWAY OUR COVER IDENTITY, 86.
LIKE YOU JUST DID BY CALLING ME 86.
I'M GREGORY WILCOX, MUSIC CRITIC FOR THE "CONCERT MUSIC" MAGAZINE.
YOU'LL NEVER FIND ME GIVING AWAY OUR COVER IDENTITY, CHIEF.
YOU JUST DID BY CALLING ME CHIEF.
- I'M FRANKLIN GILES, YOUR EDITOR.
- YES, SIR.
WELL, AN EDITOR CAN BE CALLED CHIEF.
IF YOU'RE KEEPING TIME WITH THE MUSIC, YOU'RE WAY OUT OF TEMPO.
I AM NOT KEEPING TIME.
I'M NERVOUS.
AS SOON AS HE FINISHES THE CONCERT, OUR AGENT IS GOING TO GIVE US THE NAME OF THE TOP KAOS RINGLEADER, THE NEW MR.
BIG.
IS RUDOLPH HUBERT A REGULAR CONTROL AGENT WHO BECAME A CONCERT VIOLINIST, OR IS IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?
NO, HE'S ALWAYS BEEN A CONTROL AGENT.
BUT HIS TALENT AS A VIOLINIST HAS GIVEN HIM A PERFECT COVER, AND IT GIVES HIM ACCESS TO PLACES WHERE OUR OTHER AGENTS COULDN'T GET IN.
GEE, THAT'S THE GLAMOROUS END OF THE BUSINESS, CHIEF.
TOO BAD I FLUNKED OUT OF SPY MUSIC SCHOOL.
BRAVO!
BRAVO!
I THINK HE'S GIVING US A SIGNAL.
CHECK HIM WITH YOUR GLASSES.
- WHERE'D YOU GET THOSE?
- OH, I MISPLACED MY GLASSES, CHIEF.
HE'S TOUCHING HIS BOW TO HIS LEFT SHOULDER.
THAT'S AN EMERGENCY SIGNAL.
HE'S IN DANGER.
LET'S GO.
- OH!
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?
- I FOUND MY CUFFLINKS.
- WHERE?
THEY'RE IN MY SHOE.
I TOLD YOU THEY'D BOTH LAND IN THE SAME PLACE, CHIEF.
Man: TONIGHT I THINK MY PIANO PLAYING WAS MASTERFUL FOR THE FIRST TIME.
IN FACT, I WAS TELLING-- AH, RUDOLPH.
YES, I WAS TELLING RUDOLPH I THINK NOW HE'S READY FOR THE GREAT PROKOFIEV CONCERTO.
HE'S DEAD.
YES, AND THEY TRIED TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE SUICIDE.
MAX, HUBERT WAS TOO GOOD AN AGENT NOT TO LEAVE THE NAME OF MR.
BIG SOMEWHERE.
- LOOK FOR IT.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
NOW WHERE WOULD AN AGENT WHO'S A VIOLINIST LEAVE A CLUE?
- CHIEF!
- WHAT?
I'VE GOT IT.
IN HIS VIOLIN.
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.
LOOK IN THERE AND SEE IF YOU CAN FIND A NAME.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
- CHIEF!
- WHAT?
- I FOUND IT.
- WHAT IS IT?
THE NAME OF KAOS' NEW MR.
BIG IS STRADIVARIUS.
MR.
WILCOX AND MR.
GILES, - YOU DISCOVERED THE BODY.
- THAT'S RIGHT, INSPECTOR.
NOW, MR.
BADEFF, YOU, MISS DARVEY AND MR.
WOLENSKA WERE THE LAST PEOPLE TO SEE RUDOLPH HUBERT ALIVE.
IT WAS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE CONCERT.
MISS DARVEY AND I WERE CONGRATULATING WOLENSKA ON THE BRILLIANCE OF HIS PIANO PLAYING THIS EVENING.
IS THIS TRUE, MR.
WOLENSKA?
YES, YES, I WAS MAGNIFICENT TONIGHT.
NO, NO, I MEAN ABOUT SEEING HUBERT ALIVE.
HE PASSED US ON THE WAY TO HIS DRESSING ROOM.
DO ANY OF YOU KNOW WHY RUDOLPH HUBERT MIGHT HAVE TAKEN HIS OWN LIFE?
I KNOW WHY.
BECAUSE OF ME.
I REFUSED TO PLAY ANY OF THE SYMPHONIES HE COMPOSED.
TIME AND TIME AGAIN HE ASKED ME TO PLAY THEM AND ALWAYS I REFUSED.
BUT WHY WOULDN'T YOU PLAY THEM, MR.
WOLENSKA?
BECAUSE THEY WERE TERRIBLE.
I SHOULD HAVE PLAYED THEM ANYWAY.
DON'T TOUCH MY HANDS!
THEY BELONG TO THE WORLD.
IF YOU MUST TOUCH ME, DON'T EVER TOUCH ME BELOW THE ELBOW.
INSPECTOR, AS YOU KNOW, I'M THE OWNER OF BADEFF HALL.
I HAVE A PRIVATE SUITE UPSTAIRS.
COULDN'T WE CONTINUE UP THERE?
I'M AFRAID THAT WOLENSKA IS UPSET BEING IN HUBERT'S DRESSING ROOM.
THANK YOU.
MAX, I'M CONVINCED THAT HUBERT LEFT A CLUE AS TO THE NAME OF KAOS' NEW MR.
BIG.
NOW LET'S CHECK WITH AGENT 44.
HE'S BEEN ON CONSTANT SURVEILLANCE EVER SINCE HUBERT GOT TO TOWN.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
AGENT 44 WASN'T SUPPOSED TO CONTACT HUBERT.
WELL, HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN SOMETHING.
LET'S GO.
- HELLO, 44.
- HELLO, CHIEF.
- HELLO, SMART.
- 44.
HUBERT WAS KILLED.
YES, I HEARD SOME PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT IT.
HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING SUSPICIOUS AROUND HERE?
FROM HERE, EVERYTHING LOOKS SUSPICIOUS.
LEFT A LEAD FOR US, - THE NAME OF THE NEW MR.
BIG.
- 44: HE DIDN'T LEAVE IT WITH ME.
HEY, CHIEF, I'M GETTING TIRED OF THESE ASSIGNMENTS.
THE BLOOD'S BEEN RUSHING TO MY HEAD ALL DAY.
I HAD AN AWFUL TIME DIGESTING MY DINNER.
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO FOR YOU?
JUST ONE THING.
COULD YOU PICK UP THE LOOSE CHANGE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE CASE?
KEEPS FALLING OUT OF MY POCKETS.
WELL, THERE'S NOTHING IN HERE, CHIEF.
-  - SHH!
REMEMBER WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT BEING QUIET.
IF YOU HAVE TO SCREAM, WHISPER IT.
I WAS SURE HUBERT LEFT A CLUE SOMEWHERE IN THIS PIANO.
HE WAS STANDING RIGHT NEAR IT WHEN HE SIGNALED US.
CHIEF, HUBERT WAS ONE OF OUR BEST AGENTS.
I'M SURE HE LEFT A CLUE TO THE IDENTITY OF MR.
BIG SOMEWHERE IN A VERY DEVIOUS PLACE.
I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT, MAX.
I'LL PHONE PARKER AND HAVE HIM GO DOWN TO THE LAB AND SET UP A SPECIAL SEARCH OPERATION FOR TOMORROW.
THEN I'LL FILL YOU IN ON A PLAN I HAVE.
- RIGHT HERE?
- YES, RIGHT HERE.
LET ME HAVE YOUR SHOE PHONE, MAX.
THANK YOU.
MAY I HAVE THE KEY, PLEASE, MAX?
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING MY SHOE FOR PERSONAL CALLS.
HELLO, PARKER, I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU AT A TIME LIKE THIS, BUT THIS IS A BLUE ALERT EMERGENCY.
I WANT YOU TO GO OVER TO THE LAB AND SET UP A SPECIAL SEARCH OPERATION FOR BADEFF CONCERT HALL FOR AGENT 86.
NOW HE'LL NEED AN ASSISTANT ON THIS ONE, SO FIND OUT WHICH OF OUR AGENTS HAS A GOOD ENOUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SO THEY WON'T BE UNDER SUSPICION HERE.
ALL RIGHT, GO OVER THERE RIGHT AWAY.
- HERE'S YOUR SHOE PHONE, MAX.
- OH, THANK YOU, CHIEF.
NOW HERE IS MY PLAN.
AND I'M GLAD WE'RE NOT IN MY OFFICE, OR YOU WOULD INSIST ON OUR USING THE CONE OF SILENCE.
I'VE ALREADY TAKEN MEASURES FOR THAT, CHIEF.
I'VE BROUGHT ALONG THE PORTABLE CONE OF SILENCE.
IT WAS IN MY CAR.
MAX, WE DON'T NEED THAT.
BESIDES, IT DOESN'T WORK.
LOOK, CHIEF, ACCORDING TO THE HANDBOOK, YOU'VE GOT TO TAKE SOME SECURITY MEASURES IF YOU'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT A PLAN AWAY FROM CONTROL HEADQUARTERS.
ALL RIGHT, MAX.
I WANT YOU TO TALK TO BADEFF, NICOLA DARVEY AND WOLENSKA.
THEY WERE THE LAST PEOPLE TO SEE HUBERT ALIVE.
AND ONE OF THEM MAY HAVE KILLED HIM.
NOW I WANT YOU TO FIND OUT HOW LONG THEY KNEW HUBERT.
NOW WITH YOUR COVER AS MUSIC CRITIC YOU CAN TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE DOING A HUMAN INTEREST STORY ON HIM.
- IS THAT IT, CHIEF?
- THAT'S IT.
WELL, WE DIDN'T NEED THE CONE OF SILENCE FOR THAT.
I TOLD YOU WE DIDN'T.
NOW LET'S GET THIS THING OFF.
- I CAN'T GET THE LOCK OPEN.
- NEITHER CAN I. CHIEF, I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WALK OUT OF HERE WITH THE CONE OF SILENCE ON.
MAX, WE CAN'T GO BACK TO CONTROL LIKE THIS.
WE LOOK RIDICULOUS.
WELL, MAYBE IF WE JUST ACT CASUAL, NOBODY WILL NOTICE.
- I GOT MINE OFF, CHIEF.
- GOOD, NOW HELP ME.
-  - SHH.
-  - LISTEN.
CHIEF, I THINK SOMEONE IS SNEAKING AROUND THE DRESSING ROOM AREA.
THAT MAY BE THE KILLER TRYING TO FIND OUT IF HUBERT LEFT A CLUE AS TO HIS IDENTITY.
CHECK IT OUT.
RIGHT, CHIEF, THEN I'LL COME BACK AND GET YOU OUT OF THE CONE OF SILENCE.
MISS DARVEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HUBERT'S DRESSING ROOM?
OH, I MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS MY DRESSING ROOM, BUT MINE'S NEXT DOOR.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
OH, WELL, I'M JUST TRYING TO GATHER A LITTLE BACKGROUND MATERIAL FOR THE ARTICLE THAT I'M WRITING ON HUBERT.
PERHAPS YOU COULD HELP ME.
I'M AFRAID THAT I BARELY KNEW HIM, MR.
WILCOX.
AND NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'D LIKE TO CHANGE MY CLOTHES AND GO HOME.
IT'S BEEN RATHER AN EXHAUSTING NIGHT.
YES, I GUESS THAT WORKING IN THE CONCERT FIELD THROWS YOUR PERSONAL LIFE INTO A COMPLETE STATE OF CHAOS.
I THINK WE CAN CONSIDER HER OUR PRIME SUSPECT, CHIEF.
STOP IT, MAX.
THE ECHO IN HERE IS GIVING ME A TERRIBLE HEADACHE.
HMM, MAYBE I'D BETTER GET A SLEDGEHAMMER.
-  - SHH.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, CHIEF?
-  - ANOTHER VISITOR TO THE DRESSING ROOMS.
I'LL CHECK IT OUT.
YOU STAY UNDERCOVER.
MR.
BADEFF, UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I OWN THE HALL.
I WAS GOING THROUGH HUBERT'S EFFECTS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THE ARTICLE I'M WRITING ON HUBERT, AND I COULDN'T SLEEP.
SLEEP?
WHY, YOU HAVEN'T EVEN HAD TIME TO GO HOME AND GO TO BED.
OH, WELL, THAT'S PROBABLY WHY I COULDN'T SLEEP.
INCIDENTALLY, MR.
BADEFF, AS LONG AS YOU'RE HERE, I WONDER IF YOU'D HELP ME WITH MY ARTICLE ON HUBERT.
I DON'T BELIEVE I COULD HELP YOU.
I BARELY KNEW HIM.
I MERELY ENGAGED HIM FOR THIS CONCERT.
IT'S A TERRIBLE TRAGEDY TO HAPPEN HERE.
YOU KNOW, I BUILT THIS THEATER MYSELF, PIECE BY PIECE.
- YOU BUILT THIS PLACE PIECE BY PIECE?
- YES.
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE AN OLD HAMMER LYING AROUND, WOULD YOU?
NO.
NO, OF COURSE NOT.
AND I SHALL BE CLOSING THE THEATER IN FIVE MINUTES.
I WILL ASSUME YOU'VE LEFT.
GOOD NIGHT.
GOOD NIGHT.
BADEFF CLAIMS HE DIDN'T KNOW HUBERT EITHER, BUT HE'S ACTING VERY STRANGELY.
I THINK HE'S OUR PRIME SUSPECT, CHIEF.
I THOUGHT YOU SAID NICOLA WAS OUR PRIME SUSPECT.
I DID, BUT ISN'T IT BETTER TO HAVE A CHOICE?
- DID YOU FIND A HAMMER?
- NO, CHIEF.
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO USE YOUR GUN.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
NO, MAX, THE OTHER END!
OH, RIGHT, CHIEF.
-  - SHH!
DO YOU HEAR THAT?
BACK TO THE DRESSING ROOM.
AND TELL ME, WOLENSKA, WHY DID YOU COME BACK FOR HUBERT'S SHEET MUSIC AT THIS LATE HOUR?
I SHALL PERFORM IT TOMORROW NIGHT IN HIS HONOR.
IT WILL BE MY TRIBUTE TO MY FELLOW ARTISTS AND PERHAPS EASE A BIT OF THE SORROW IN MY HEART.
DON'T TOUCH MY HANDS!
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
IS THIS THE MUSIC?
YES, BUT THE SYMPHONY HAS NO TITLE.
HUBERT DID NOT FINISH IT.
WELL, WHY DON'T WE JUST CALL IT "HUBERT'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY"?
A SPARK OF GENIUS, MR.
WILCOX!
I SHALL REHEARSE IT EVERY SINGLE MOMENT FROM NOW UNTIL MY MAGNIFICENT PERFORMANCE TOMORROW NIGHT.
COME ON, CHIEF, LET'S GET BACK TO CONTROL.
I WANT TO CHECK ON WOLENSKA.
I THINK HE'S OUR PRIME SUSPECT.
WHAT ABOUT NICOLA AND BADEFF?
OH, YES, WELL, IN THE SCIENCE OF CRIMINOLOGY, THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO NARROW DOWN A CHOICE LIKE THIS.
- WHAT'S THAT?
- EENIE MEENIE MINEY-- - MAX!
- COME ON, CHIEF.
- LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
- LET ME GET THIS THING OFF.
- I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING OUT OF HERE, MAX.
- DON'T WORRY, I'LL LEAD YOU.
THERE'S A STAIR TO THE ORCHESTRA PIT RIGHT OVER HERE.
- ARE YOU SURE?
- POSITIVE, CHIEF.
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMEHOW I THINK THE HAMMER MIGHT HAVE BEEN EASIER.
WHAT'S UP, CHIEF?
I GOT HERE AS SOON AS I COULD.
WE NEED SOMEONE WITH A GOOD MUSICAL BACKGROUND TO WORK WITH MAX AT BADEFF HALL.
FILL ME IN.
WELL, I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OPERA.
I STUDIED SINGING.
AND I CAN PLAY THE VIOLIN AND THE HARP.
THAT'S IT, THE VIOLIN.
YOU'LL GO ALONG WITH MAX AS HIS VIOLIN PROTEGE.
BETTER TAKE ALONG THIS HELIO-COAT, SMART.
IT MAY COME IN HANDY.
I THINK WE COULD USE AN EMERGENCY WEAPON, MAX.
WELL, WE HAVE ONE RIGHT HERE, 99.
THIS VIOLIN SHOOTS LIKE A GUN.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, BELLAMY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THE VIOLIN WAS LOADED.
CARRIE, MY DEAR, IT IS TRUE.
YOU'VE NEVER HEARD ANYTHING LIKE THIS IN YOUR LIFE.
I DON'T THINK SO, NO.
BRAVO, MAGNIFICENT!
YOU LIKE THAT, MR.
WILCOX?
ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU'RE A MUSIC LOVER?
WELL, OF COURSE I AM.
DO YOU KNOW THAT I ONCE LISTENED TO THREE STRAIGHT WEEKS OF BEETHOVEN?
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
THREE WEEKS OF BEETHOVEN.
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE TWO WEEKS OF BACH?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT AN HOUR OF "LOONEY TUNES"?
THIS IS RIDICULOUS!
HUBERT WAS A GOOD MAN BUT A TERRIBLE COMPOSER.
WHOEVER HEARD OF SUCH NOTES?
B-FLAT, A, D-FLAT, E, F-SHARP, F-NATURAL.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, NICOLA?
B-FLAT, A, D-FLAT, E, F-SHARP, F-NATURAL?
- "BADEFF".
- YES, THAT'S MY NAME.
EVIDENTLY, HUBERT DID LEAVE SOME EVIDENCE OF MY IDENTITY.
YOU KNOW, IF I COULD FIGURE IT OUT, SOMEONE ELSE VERY WELL MIGHT.
WOLENSKA'S PLAYING IT TONIGHT.
NO, HE ISN'T.
HAVE BORIS FIX THE PIANO SO THAT WE GET RID OF WOLENSKA AND "HUBERT'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY" AT THE SAME TIME.
ENOUGH, WOLENSKA.
THAT'S ENOUGH REHEARSING.
REMEMBER, IN JUST A FEW HOURS YOU HAVE A CONCERT.
YOU SHOULD REST.
- GOOD LUCK, MR.
WOLENSKA.
- DON'T TOUCH MY HANDS!
- HELLO, 44.
- HELLO, 66.
WELL, I'M UPSIDE DOWN.
YOU NEED HELP?
HAVEN'T BEEN ON MY FEET SINCE YESTERDAY.
OH, SURE, EVERYTHING'S IMPORTANT.
EVERYTHING'S IMPORTANT BUT ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHY I ALWAYS GET THESE ASSIGNMENTS.
I'M ALWAYS IN A WASHING MACHINE OR A FROZEN FOOD LOCKER OR A MAILBOX.
MAX, I THINK I'VE GOT A LEAD.
FORGET 44.
OH, SURE, FORGET 44.
EVERYBODY FORGETS 44.
FORGET HIM.
FORGET 44, FORGET HIM.
- WHAT IS IT, 99?
- WELL, BADEFF DIDN'T WANT US TO GET A LOOK AT "HUBERT'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY".
WAS THAT MUSIC THE LAST THING THAT HUBERT WROTE - BEFORE HE WAS KILLED?
- WELL, I GUESS SO.
IT WAS DISCOVERED RIGHT BESIDE THE BODY WHEN WE FOUND HIM.
WELL, THE LAST SIX NOTES WERE VERY ODD, MAX.
MAYBE HE LEFT THE NAME OF MR.
BIG IN THE SYMPHONY.
DO YOU REMEMBER THE NOTES?
OF COURSE I REMEMBER THE NOTES.
AFTER ALL, I STUDIED A LITTLE PIANO MYSELF.
NOW LET'S SEE  B-FLAT, A, D-FLAT, E, F-SHARP AND F-NATURAL.
PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER-- THEY SPELL "BADEFF".
BADEFF!
WELL, THEN BADEFF IS THE KILLER.
THEN BADEFF IS MR.
BIG.
WELL, LET'S JUST GO RIGHT UPSTAIRS, 99, AND GIVE MR.
BADEFF A NICE BIG SURPRISE.
WELL, YOU CERTAINLY RUINED A NICE SURPRISE.
MAX, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THOSE ROPES FOR TWO HOURS.
ANY LUCK?
NOTHING, 99.
I CAN'T GET LOOSE.
RELEASE THEM, BORIS.
WELL, I SEE YOU'VE FINALLY COME TO YOUR SENSES, BADEFF.
- YOU'RE GOING TO SURRENDER, EH?
- HARDLY, MR.
SMART.
WE'RE MERELY GETTING READY TO KILL YOU.
THE FLOOR OF THIS STOREROOM IS REALLY AN ELECTRONIC BOOBY TRAP.
ONE STEP ANYWHERE WILL INITIATE AN ELECTRONIC IMPULSE WHICH WILL CAUSE SEVERAL LARGE HEAVY OBJECTS TO CRASH DOWN.
AND WHEN YOUR BODIES ARE FOUND, YOU WILL APPEAR TO HAVE DIED BY ACCIDENT.
YOU'LL NEVER GET AWAY WITH THIS, BADEFF.
SOMEONE'S GONNA FIGURE OUT YOUR NAME THE MINUTE WOLENSKA PLAYS "HUBERT'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY".
- HE'LL NEVER GET TO PLAY IT.
-  WOLENSKA'S JUST COME ONSTAGE TO START THE CONCERT.
OH, GOOD, WE CAN HEAR IT DOWN HERE, 99.
YOU'LL ONLY HEAR THE FIRST SELECTION THAT LASTS EXACTLY THREE MINUTES.
THEN AFTER HIS BOW, ACCORDING TO THE PROGRAM THAT I'VE ARRANGED, WOLENSKA WILL SIT DOWN TO PLAY "HUBERT'S UNFINISHED SYMPHONY".
HOWEVER, WHEN HIS FINGERS STRIKE THE FIRST CHORD, IT WILL SET OFF A BOMB IN THE PIANO, WHICH WILL EXPLODE, DESTROYING HIM AND THE EVIDENCE.
THIS SWITCH WILL ACTIVATE THE ELECTRONIC FLOOR.
MAX, THAT CONCERTO LASTS EXACTLY THREE MINUTES.
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO?
- I'M GOING TO TEST THIS FLOOR, 99.
- I HAVE A THOUGHT.
WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT?
CALL THE CHIEF ON YOUR SHOE-PHONE.
DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER THOUGHT?
THAT WAS MY SHOE-PHONE.
TIME'S RUNNING OUT, MAX.
THERE MUST BE A WAY, 99.
WAIT A MINUTE.
IF WE CAN'T GO ACROSS THE FLOOR, - GO OVER IT.
- IF WE CAN'T GO ACROSS THE FLOOR, GO OF COURSE.
MY HELIO-COAT.
OKAY, 99.
YOU CAN COME ACROSS THE FLOOR NOW.
AND BRING A SHARP PIN.
- BORIS.
- MAX, USE THE VIOLIN GUN.
ALL RIGHT, HOLD IT.
ONE STROKE OF MY BOW, AND THIS VIOLIN WILL PLAY ITS SONG OF DEATH.
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT THIS IS KILLING ME.
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, BORIS.
I'M USED TO DEALING WITH GORILLAS LIKE YOU.
LISTEN, BORIS, I HOPE I WASN'T OUT OF LINE WITH THAT CRACK ABOUT THE GORILLA.
HOLD IT!
MAX, STOP WOLENSKA.
WHEN HE HITS THE FIRST CHORD, THE BOMB WILL EXPLODE!
- STOP!
- DON'T TOUCH MY HANDS!
OH, THANK YOU, MR.
SMART.
THANK YOU.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
DON'T TOUCH MY HANDS!
WELL, WE GOT THEM.
ALL OF THEM.
BADEFF AND NICOLA ARE ON THEIR WAY TO JAIL.
AT LAST WE'VE BROKEN THE CULTURAL ARM OF KAOS.
THIS IS GOING TO BE A REAL BLOW TO EVIL MUSIC LOVERS EVERYWHERE.
IS THERE ANYTHING WRONG, MAX?
HUH?
OH, NO, CHIEF.
IT'S JUST THAT, WELL, THIS HAS BEEN A PARTICULARLY TOUGH CASE AND MY NERVES ARE A LITTLE ON EDGE.
BESIDES, I'M HURT.
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
- WELL THIS IS THE FIRST TIME I'VE PLAYED IN FRONT OF AN AUDIENCE, YOU KNOW?
THAT WAS VERY BRAVE OF YOU, MAX.
IT WAS MY DEBUT.
I'VE NEVER HEARD "CHOPSTICKS" PLAYED WITH SUCH IMAGINATION.
WELL, WHY DIDN'T THEY ASK FOR AN ENCORE?
LISTEN, MAX, SOME OF US ARE BORN TO DO ONE THING.
SOME AREN'T.
YOU HAVE YOUR TALENTS.
OTHERS HAVE OTHER TALENTS.
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT, CHIEF.
I MAY NEVER GET TO PLAY WITH THE PHILHARMONIC, - BUT ON THE OTHER HAND - YES.
IS LEONARD BERNSTEIN LICENSED TO KILL?
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
HEY, MACK, HERE'S YOUR SOUP.
HEY, THIS ISN'T TOMATO SOUP.
NOW IT IS.
MY COMPLIMENTS TO THE CHEF.
- MIND IF I SIT DOWN?
- YES.
THANK YOU.
CAREFUL, SOME OF IT'S GETTING IN YOUR MOUTH.
- WHAT'LL YOU HAVE?
- BEER.
WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT, 86?
- I THINK I'VE GOT A LEAD, CHIEF.
- HOLD IT.
GO AHEAD.
WHOEVER STOLE THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP IS GONNA SMUGGLE 'EM OUT OF THE COUNTRY TONIGHT.
- HOW'D YOU FIND THAT OUT?
- I MADE CONTACT WITH AN INFORMER.
HE'S GONNA FIND OUT WHAT SHIP THEY'RE PLANNING TO USE.
HE SHOULD BE IN HERE ANY MINUTE.
- GOOD WORK, MAX.
- THERE'S ONLY ONE PROBLEM, CHIEF.
HE WON'T GIVE THE INFORMATION TO ME.
HE'S AFRAID THEY'RE SUSPICIOUS ALREADY, AND IF HE'S SEEN TALKING TO ME, HE'LL BE IN GREAT DANGER.
YOU GO BACK TO YOUR TABLE.
WHEN THE MAN COMES IN, YOU WHISTLE A COUPLE OF BARS OF "YANKEE DOODLE".
I'LL MAKE THE CONTACT.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- YOU CAN WHISTLE, CAN'T YOU?
OF COURSE I CAN WHISTLE.
ONE MORE THING, CHIEF, VERY IMPORTANT.
WHAT?
DON'T ORDER THE TOMATO SOUP.
SING "YANKEE DOODLE".
- LET'S SEE - WHAT'S THE MATTER, BUDDY?
NOTHING, NOTHING.
I'M JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER HOW "YANKEE DOODLE" GOES.
Woman: WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
LET ME ALONE!
Chief: I'M SORRY, MADAM.
I'M SORRY.
DON'T "MADAM" ME.
I'LL CALL A COP!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
THAT WASN'T HIM.
I KNOW.
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR "CLAIRE DE LUNE"?
HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?
IT'S SNOWING.
-  -   WHO DID THIS?
CAN YOU TELL US?
- WHO STOLE THE PLANS?
-  DRINK, PLEASE.
DRINK.
HERE YOU ARE, FELLA.
DRINK THIS MILK.
IS IT REGULAR OR SKIM?
IT'S REGULAR.
GO AHEAD, DRINK IT.
STRICT DIET.
ONLY DRINK SKIM.
CAN'T YOU TELL US ANYTHING?
EVENING STAR SAILS AT MIDNIGHT.
HE'S DEAD, MAX.
- DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS?
- YES, CHIEF.
TOO MUCH DIETING CAN BE A VERY DANGEROUS THING.
DON'T RELEASE THEM UNTIL YOU'VE RUN A SECURITY CHECK ON ALL OF THEM.
WATCH THE DOOR, LARRABEE.
YOU KNOW, CHIEF, I'LL NEVER FORGET THE SOUND THAT KILLER MADE WHEN HE WALKED AWAY.
I'LL RECOGNIZE IT IMMEDIATELY THE NEXT TIME I HEAR IT.
- WHAT WAS IT LIKE, MAX?
- WELL, IT WAS A KIND OF A CLIP-CLOP, CLIP-CLOP.
LIKE A MAN WITH A SPECIAL SHOE?
- OR A MAN WALKING WITH A CANE.
- OR A MAN WITH VERY LOOSE DENTURES.
LET'S GET ON WITH THE BRIEFING.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.
- THE EVENING STAR SAILS IN ABOUT 15 MINUTES.
- OKAY, CHIEF.
FIRST OF ALL, SMART, THIS IS A MODEL OF THE SAME TYPE OF SHIP AS THE EVENING STAR.
PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THIS SECTION OF THE SHIP.
THIS IS THE PASSENGER SECTION.
IT'S AWFULLY SMALL, ISN'T IT?
- IT'S A FREIGHTER, MAX.
- I DON'T CARE.
IT ONLY CARRIES HALF A DOZEN PASSENGERS.
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE CARGO?
THE EVENING STAR'S CARGO IS DIVIDED INTO TWO COMPARTMENTS.
IN THIS COMPARTMENT THERE ARE ABOUT 900 TONS OF BANANAS.
OH, BOY.
IF THIS WALL IN BETWEEN THE BANANAS AND THE OTHER COMPARTMENT EVER BREAKS DOWN, THERE WILL BE REAL TROUBLE.
WHY, WHAT'S IN THE OTHER COMPARTMENT?
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, PROFESSOR PARKER.
HOW MANY BANANAS WOULD THAT BE TO A MONKEY?
OH, WELL, THAT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW HUNGRY EACH MONKEY WOULD BE AND-- WOULDN'T IT ALSO DEPEND UPON HOW LARGE THE BANANAS WERE?
GENTLEMEN, FORGET ABOUT THE MONKEYS.
THIS IS SOME SORT OF ZOOLOGICAL EXPEDITION.
NOW, MAX, WHEN YOU GET BEYOND THE THREE-MILE LIMIT, THIS CASE AUTOMATICALLY FALLS UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CONTROL SECTION.
YOU'LL BE CONTACTED BY AN AGENT WHO'LL GIVE YOU FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
- HOW, CHIEF?
- POSSIBLY WITH THIS.
OH, WELL, I CERTAINLY HOPE THE MESSAGE DOESN'T REACH ME.
OH, THIS IS NO ORDINARY GUN, SMART.
THIS IS A VERY CLEVERLY DISGUISED RADIO TELEPHONE.
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU.
WHAT'S THE NUMBER ON YOUR HANDLE?
OKAY, SIX FIVE TWO.
- WHAT HAPPENS NOW?
- BREAK IT AND TALK INTO THE HANDLE.
- HELLO.
- HELLO!
OH, IS THAT YOU, PARKER?
YES, INDEED.
IS THAT YOU, SMART?
YES, HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?
OH, JUST FINE AND YOU?
OH, PRETTY GOOD.
CERTAINLY IS NICE TALKING TO YOU.
LISTEN, PARKER, THERE'S A QUESTION I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU.
- SHOOT.
- NOW-- - NOW ABOUT THE BANANAS.
IF EACH MONKEY-- - YOU'RE DOING IT AGAIN.
LET'S GET ON WITH THE BRIEFING.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
PARKER, THERE'S ONE THING THAT BOTHERS ME.
THIS MAKES AN AWFULLY LOUD RING.
WHAT IF YOU WANNA PHONE SOMEONE QUIETLY?
WELL, USE YOUR SILENCER.
I BROUGHT YOUR SUITCASES, MAX.
YOU'D BETTER HURRY.
IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT.
- RIGHT, 99.
- GET GOING, MAX.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS THAT BOAT.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
DON'T WORRY.
I'LL DO THE JOB.
- GOOD LUCK, MAX.
- BE CAREFUL, MAX.
- RIGHT, 99.
- REMEMBER, MAX, FIND THEM AND BRING THEM BACK.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
CHIEF, WHAT AM I LOOKING FOR?
THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP.
- OH, THE STOLEN BLUEPRINTS.
- WE DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE BLUEPRINTS.
- THEY MAY HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A DRAWING.
- THEY COULD BE ON MICROFILM.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT SHAPE THEY'RE IN.
WE WANT YOU TO GET ONBOARD AND FIND THE PLANS BEFORE THE BOAT REACHES ITS DESTINATION.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
- NOW DO YOU WANT ANYONE TO GO WITH YOU TO SHOW YOU WHERE THE EVENING STAR IS TIED UP?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF.
I KNOW THIS SECTION OF TOWN LIKE I KNOW THE BACK OF MY HAND.
CAN SOMEBODY SHOW ME TO THE BACK OF MY HAND?
HI, 86.
WELCOME ABOARD.
THANK YOU.
NICE TO SEE THAT YOU'RE HERE BACKING ME UP.
HOW FAR OUT ARE WE?
- OH, ABOUT 20 MILES.
- HOW CAN YOU TELL?
THIS IS MY FIFTH TRIP.
YOU GET SO YOU CAN RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS.
TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER, THE KIND OF SEAGULLS, THE NUMBER OF FISH AROUND.
ARE THERE FISH DOWN THERE?
SURE, TAKE A LOOK.
OH, YES, I SEE THEM.
QUITE OF BIT OF THEM TOO.
- WHAT ARE THEY?
- SHARKS.
IT'S NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.
THEY'RE JUST WAITING AROUND FOR SOMETHING TO EAT.
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE ME.
TRY TO KEEP UP YOUR NERVE, 44.
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE A CONTROL AGENT.
SURE, THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE GOT-- NICE DRY CLOTHES, GOOD FOOD, NICE WARM STATEROOM.
- LOOK WHERE I'VE GOT TO STAY.
- WHERE?
IN THE CARGO HOLD.
WITH THE BANANAS AND THE MONKEYS?
THAT'S WHERE I'LL BE DURING THE DAY DISGUISED AS ONE OF THEM.
YOU'RE DISGUISING YOURSELF AS A BANANA?
NO, AS A MONKEY.
WELL, I'D BETTER BE GETTING BACK THERE.
- THEY'RE SAVING MY DINNER FOR ME.
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?
I THINK IT'S CABBAGE TONIGHT.
CABBAGE?
WELL, THAT'S NOT SO GOOD.
DON'T WORRY, 44.
I'LL TRY AND SMUGGLE SOMETHING DOWN FROM THE PASSENGERS' TABLE FOR YOU.
I DON'T MIND EATING WITH THE MONKEYS.
ANYWAY, SOME OF US HAVE GOTTEN TOGETHER.
WE'RE TRYING TO BREAK THROUGH TO THE BANANAS.
WELL, GOOD LUCK.
I HOPE YOU MAKE IT.
OH, ONE MORE THING, 44.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT SUSPECTS?
YOU MEAN SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HAVE SMUGGLED THE PLANS - FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP ONBOARD?
- EXACTLY.
I'VE BEEN ON THE JOB, 86.
I GOT A LIST RIGHT HERE OF ALL POSSIBLE SUSPECTS.
CAREFUL, 44!
- THAT WAS A CLOSE ONE.
- YES.
YOU ALMOST DROPPED THE LIST.
WELL, NOW LET'S SEE.
THIS SHOULD NARROW THE SUSPECTS DOWN QUITE A BIT.
- WELL, I'LL SEE YOU LATER, 44.
- RIGHT.
THIS LOOKS LIKE THE COMPLETE PASSENGER LIST.
IT IS.
DON'T YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL THIS FREIGHTER?
- WHAT?
- SHIP OF SPIES.
WELL, HANG ON, 44.
OH!
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I'M AFRAID WE HAVEN'T BEEN PROPERLY INTRODUCED, SENOR.
OH, FORGIVE ME.
MY NAME IS MAXWELL SMART.
MY NAME IS CONSUELA JUANITA DOROTEA MARQUITA MERENDEZ.
OH, THIS IS JUST A WILD GUESS.
BUT YOU'RE NOT AMERICAN, ARE YOU?
HOW VERY OBSERVANT OF YOU, MR.
SMART.
YES, WELL, WE'RE TRAINED TO BE OBSERVANT, MISS MERENDEZ.
OR SHOULD I CALL YOU FRAULEIN?
I AM SPANISH, MR.
SMART.
OH, WELL, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN MY NEXT GUESS.
- WELL, I THINK YOU CAN RELEASE ME NOW.
- OH.
I WONDER IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHY YOU'VE BEEN WANDERING AROUND THIS SHIP - IN YOUR NIGHTGOWN.
- THIS IS NOT MY NIGHTGOWN, MR.
SMART.
IT IS MY COSTUME.
I AM A PROFESSIONAL DANCER.
I HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED TO ENTERTAIN THE PASSENGERS.
HAVE YOU ALSO BEEN EMPLOYED TO ENTER OTHER PEOPLE'S STATEROOMS?
ALL THOSE CABINS AND CORRIDORS LOOK SO MUCH ALIKE, I THOUGHT THIS WAS MY CABIN.
- 'TIS AN EASY MISTAKE TO MAKE.
- I SEE.
PERHAPS YOU WILL MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE SOME NIGHT, MR.
SMART.
I DOUBT THAT.
I HAVE AN UNCANNY SENSE OF DIRECTION.
OF COURSE, NONE OF US ARE INFALLIBLE.
ONE MOMENT, MISS MERENDEZ.
SI, SENOR SMART.
ONE QUESTION BEFORE YOU LEAVE.
THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE I HEARD IN THE CORRIDOR JUST BEFORE YOU CAME IN YOU MEAN THIS, SENOR SMART?
SO THAT WAS IT.
IT IS MY CASTANETS.
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO BREAK THIS HOLD.
THAT'S THE WAY.
- 99!
- OH, MAX.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY.
BUT I HEARD THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE YOU WERE TELLING US ABOUT, AND I OPENED THE DOOR TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND YOU CAME IN.
YES, WELL, THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE IS MADE BY THAT MAN ACROSS THE HALL.
I WANNA USE YOUR CABIN TO GET A RUNNING START - AND BREAK HIS DOOR DOWN.
- RIGHT.
OKAY, READY, SET, GO!
WAIT A MINUTE, 99.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ONBOARD?
THIS IS MY CASE.
OH, WELL, I HAD THIS TWO WEEKS VACATION COMING, AND THERE WAS AN EXTRA CABIN, AND SO HERE I AM.
WELL, THIS ISN'T A VERY GOOD PLACE FOR A VACATION.
ARE YOU READY?
SET, GO!
WAIT A MINUTE, 99.
ARE YOU SURE THE CHIEF DIDN'T SEND YOU HERE - TO BACK ME UP?
- OF COURSE NOT, MAX.
- THE CHIEF KNOWS YOU CAN TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.
- GOOD.
- READY, SET, GO!
- WAIT A MINUTE, MAX.
BEFORE YOU GO, DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHTA SPEAK TO CAPTAIN GROMAN?
WHY, IS HE GOOD AT BREAKING DOWN DOORS?
NO, MAX, BUT AFTER ALL, THIS IS HIS SHIP.
- YES, WELL, HAVE YOU MET THE CAPTAIN YET?
- NO.
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT-- LOOK UP IN THE CONTROL FILES - AND SEE IF WE'VE GOT ANYTHING ON HIM.
- RIGHT.
RIGHT HERE, MAX.
"CAPTAIN HARVEY WOLF GROMAN".
WOLF?
IS THAT WHAT THE CREW CALLS HIM?
NO, WOLF IS HIS GIVEN NAME.
THE CREW CALLS HIM HARVEY.
"HE'S SEEN OVER 30 YEARS MARITIME EXPERIENCE.
HE'S LOST TWO SHIPS IN THE LAST WAR".
ALLIED OR ENEMY?
- ONE OF EACH.
- A MAN OF DIVIDED LOYALTIES.
"HE HAS ONLY ONE FRIEND WHO'S AN ORIENTAL AND ACTS AS HIS BODYGUARD".
YES, WELL, I'LL TRY AND GET A LOOK AT BOTH OF THEM LATER.
- RIGHT NOW I WANNA BREAK THIS GUY'S DOOR DOWN.
- RIGHT.
READY SET, GO!
MAX, MAX-- OH!
MAX, WHERE ARE YOU?
MAX!
HERE WE GO.
- 99.
- WHAT, MAX?
YOU DON'T SUPPOSE WHEN YOU PULLED ME, YOU MIGHT HAVE TORN ME IN HALF, DO YOU?
MAX, WHOEVER DID THIS HIT ME AND LEFT THE CABIN JUST AFTER WE ARRIVED.
I HEARD A CLIP-CLOP GO DOWN THE HALLWAY.
- YOU THINK HE'S DEAD?
- YES.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- YES.
NO.
WELL, THAT'S TWO FOR AND ONE AGAINST.
MAX, HE'S STILL ALIVE.
- WHO ARE YOU?
- INSPECTOR SEHOKIAN, ARMENIAN BRANCH, INTERNATIONAL CONTROL.
WHO DID THIS?
CANNOT GIVE YOU HIS-- HOW YOU SAY?
- NAME.
- IDENTITY.
WE'D BETTER GET HIM A DOCTOR.
NO TIME.
MUST TALK BEFORE I BEFORE I - HOW DO YOU SAY?
- DIE.
SUCCUMB.
THE MAN WHO DID THIS WHO-- HOW DO YOU SAY?
- STABBED YOU.
- ATTACKED ME.
HE-- HE KNEW I HAVE UNCOVERED - HOW DO YOU SAY?
- INFORMATION?
- EVIDENCE.
- BUT PLEASE, NO BUTS.
THE PLANS, THEY ARE NOT PLANS.
THEY ARE - MAX, HE'S - DEAD.
DECEASED.
WHAT DID HE MEAN THE PLANS ARE NOT PLANS?
I DON'T KNOW, 99, BUT WE'VE GOTTA GET THIS INFORMATION TO CONTROL.
- RIGHT.
MAX, LISTEN.
-  HE MAKES THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE, TOO.
YES, IF THIS KEEPS UP, THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE IS GONNA MAKE THE TOP OF THE CHARTS.
- WHO IS THAT MAN?
- WELL, ACCORDING TO THE PASSENGER LIST, HIS NAME IS HECTOR BACCARDO.
HE'S THE FAMOUS PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER.
I KNOW THIS IS A STUPID QUESTION, 99, BUT HOW DOES HE PLAY POLO?
WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY.
I KNEW IT WAS A STUPID QUESTION.
HE MUST HAVE JUST COME FROM UP ON DECK.
- WE'D BETTER KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
- RIGHT.
I'M GOING UP ON DECK.
- WHOEVER MURDERED INSPECTOR-- HOW DO YOU SAY?
- SEHOKIAN.
SEHOKIAN.
WHOEVER MURDERED HIM MAY BE UP THERE.
- I'M GOING WITH YOU, MAX.
- NO, YOU'RE GOING RIGHT BACK TO YOUR CABIN.
- IF I NEED YOU, I'LL CALL YOU ON THIS.
- THE PISTOL PHONE?
RIGHT, AND, 99, PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
- THERE HAVE BEEN ENOUGH KILLINGS FOR ONE DAY.
- OH, MAX, FOR THE FIRST TIME, I REALLY FEEL AFRAID.
FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER OR FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY?
FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE YOU AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER.
LISTEN, 99, JUST REMEMBER THIS-- A COWARD IS A FRIGHTENED MAN WHO'S SCARED TO BE BRAVE, BUT A BRAVE MAN IS ONLY A COWARD WHO ISN'T SCARED TO BE FRIGHTENED.
OH, THANK YOU, MAX.
I'LL REMEMBER THAT.
- ARE YOU READY?
- YES.
- HELLO.
- MAX, YOU ALL RIGHT?
- YES, I'M ALL RIGHT, 99.
- WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAX?
WELL, I CAN SEE A LIGHT.
- What is it?
- Max: IT MUST BE THE BRIDGE.
I CAN JUST BARELY MAKE OUT SOMEONE STANDING UP THERE.
THAT MUST BE CAPTAIN GROMAN.
WELL, NOW THERE'S SOMEONE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.
That must be Captain Groman's Oriental servant.
SO THAT'S GROMAN'S CHINESE.
- NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING, MAX?
- NOTHING, 99.
I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANYONE UP HERE BESIDES ME.
- WAIT A MINUTE.
- What is it?
THAT NOISE, THAT CLIP-CLOP.
I HEAR IT.
- WHAT IS IT, MAX?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?
- SHH!
HAVE TO HANG UP NOW.
- I MAY HAVE TO FIRE MY PHONE.
- RIGHT.
MAX, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
ANSWER ME.
LISTEN, 99, THIS MAY BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC, BUT IF I CAN HOLD OUT UNTIL MORNING, - AT LEAST I CAN SEE WHO'S SHOOTING AT ME.
-  - MAX, DO YOU NEED HELP?
- NO NO, I WOULDN'T COME UP HERE, 99.
-  - IT'S A ROTTEN NIGHT.
HOLD ON, MAX.
I'M COMING RIGHT UP.
MAX, IS IT VERY COLD UP THERE?
-  - NO, BUT IT'S A LITTLE DAMP.
OH!
MY DOOR'S LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE.
I CAN'T OPEN IT!
MAX!
MAX, WHERE ARE YOU?
I'M DOWN HERE, 99!
- WHERE, MAX?
- IN THE WATER!
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, MAX?
HAVE YOU GOT THE CONTROL FILES HANDY?
THEY'RE IN MY CABIN.
GET THEM!
I'VE GOT THEM.
LOOK UP MY RECORD.
RIGHT HERE, MAX.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO KNOW?
DID I PASS THE CONTROL SWIMMING TEST?
NO!
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
MAX, WHAT'S HAPPENING?
ANSWER ME!
LISTEN, 99, THIS MAY BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC, BUT IF I CAN HOLD OUT UNTIL MORNING - AT LEAST I CAN SEE WHO'S SHOOTING AT-- -  MAX, DO YOU NEED HELP?
NO NO, I WOULDN'T COME UP HERE, 99.
-  - IT'S A ROTTEN NIGHT.
HOLD ON, MAX, I'M COMING RIGHT UP.
MY DOOR'S LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE.
I CAN'T OPEN IT.
MAX!
WHERE ARE YOU?
!
IN THE WATER!
HANG ON, MAX!
Max: 99, HURRY!
HANG ON, MAX!
Max: 99, HURRY!
I CAN'T HOLD ON MUCH LONGER!
HERE IT COMES, MAX!
THAT'S IT, MAX.
HANG ON, YOU'RE ALMOST HERE.
COME ON, MAX, A LITTLE FURTHER.
- OH.
-  - FAST WORK, 99.
- MAX, CAN YOU GET THROUGH THE PORTHOLE?
I DON'T THINK SO.
CAN YOU HANG ON UNTIL I GET SOME HELP?
- YES, BUT HURRY UP, 99.
- RIGHT, MAX.
MAX, WOULD YOU LIKE AN UMBRELLA?
NO, 99, FORGET THE UMBRELLA.
HURRY UP, GET HELP.
I CAN'T HANG ON MUCH LONGER.
RIGHT, MAX.
BUT MAX, THE DOOR'S LOCKED.
SHOOT IT OFF!
RIGHT.
OH, MAX.
THAT THIS IS THE SECTION OF THE RAIL THAT GAVE WAY.
I'M SURE YOU'RE RIGHT, MAX.
BUT LOOK, THERE'S NOT A SIGN OF ANY DAMAGE.
YES, WELL JUST PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER AND THAT MEANS-- THAT SOMEONE FIXED IT QUIETLY DURING THE NIGHT.
OR ELSE THE ENTIRE SHIP HAS BEEN REPLACED.
- OH, MAX.
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL POSSIBILITIES, 99.
- DID YOU BRING YOUR PORTABLE HAIR DRYER WITH YOU?
- YES, IT'S RIGHT HERE.
- LET'S GO AND CONTACT THE CHIEF.
- RIGHT.
COME ON, WE'LL GO OVER HERE.
THIS IS 99 CALLING CONTROL.
COME IN, CONTROL.
HELLO, 99, THIS IS THE CHIEF.
GIVE ME YOUR REPORT.
WELL, HERE'S THE SITUATION, CHIEF.
LAST NIGHT SOMEONE TRIED TO KILL MAX.
Chief: How is he?
OH, HE'S FINE, CHIEF, JUST FINE.
HAVE YOU ESTABLISHED CONTACT WITH INSPECTOR SEHOKIAN?
- 99: He's dead, Chief.
- DEAD?
HOW'D IT HAPPEN?
HE WAS STABBED LAST NIGHT JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER WE SAILED.
- WAS HE ABLE TO TELL YOU ANYTHING?
- WELL, JUST BEFORE HE DIED HE TRIED TO TELL US SOMETHING ABOUT THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP.
DID HE TELL YOU WHO STOLE THEM?
NO, ALL HE SAID WAS THAT THE PLANS ARE NOT PLANS.
- AND WHAT ABOUT SUSPECTS?
- THERE'S A SENORITA MERENDEZ WHO'S A SPANISH DANCER.
AND THERE'S A HECTOR BACCARDO, A PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER.
- LET ME TALK TO 86.
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
MAX, HE WANTS TO TALK TO YOU.
HI, CHIEF, THIS IS MAX.
Chief: Max, are there any clues?
NO, CHIEF, JUST THAT CLIP-CLOP SOUND I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.
DOES ANYONE ONBOARD MAKE THAT NOISE?
EVERYONE ONBOARD MAKES THAT NOISE.
MAX I THINK I'LL GET A HELICOPTER AND COME OUT THERE.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF, I CAN HANDLE THIS CASE.
WE CAN'T TAKE THE CHANCE OF THOSE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP FALLING INTO ENEMY HANDS.
WE MUST FIND THEM.
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
I'LL FIND 'EM.
AND WHEN I DO, I'LL CONTACT YOU.
OKAY.
BUT TRY TO KEEP YOUR IDENTITY AS SECRET AS POSSIBLE.
DON'T WORRY, CHIEF.
I KNOW HOW TO BE INCONSPIC-- --UOUS.
WITH ALL THIS DAMPNESS IN THE AIR, I CAN NEVER DO A THING WITH MY HAIR.
YEAH, THEY'RE WONDERFUL.
YES, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT STARTS TO CURL UP ON THE-- MAX!
COME ON, 99.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
MAX, LOOK OUT!
MAX!
THIS WAS AN OBVIOUS ATTEMPT ON YOUR LIFE.
EITHER THAT, OR SOMEBODY ELSE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH THIS CHAIR.
LOOK, MAX, THEY GOT OUR RADIO.
- NOW, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
- I'M GOING DOWN TO SEE THE CAPTAIN.
- DO YOU THINK IT'LL DO ANY GOOD?
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW, 99, BUT WE'VE GOTTA TAKE THE CHANCE.
HE MAY KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE OTHER PASSENGERS THAT WE DON'T.
RIGHT.
MAX, LOOK!
THERE'S GROMAN'S CHINESE SERVANT.
PARDON ME, MATE.
CAN YOU TELL ME WHERE I CAN FIND CAPTAIN GROMAN?
HE'S GOT A VERY BAD SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.
IT'S CHINESE, MAX.
THAT'S THE WORST KIND.
WHAT DID HE SAY?
- OH, THE CAPTAIN'S IN HIS CABIN.
WELL, I'M GOING DOWN THERE.
YOU STAY UP HERE - AND SEE IF YOU CAN KEEP HIM BUSY FOR A FEW MINUTES.
- RIGHT.
-  - AVAST!
HARD TO STARBOARD!
FULL RUDDER!
WATCH YOUR STERN!
PARDON ME, CAPTAIN.
I WONDER IF I COULD HAVE A WORD WITH YOU.
COME FORWARD, SIR, LET ME LOOK AT YOU.
- CAPTAIN, I'D LIKE TO-- - DON'T BE AFRAID, SIR.
THIS OLD SEA MONSTER HAS LOST MOST OF HIS TEETH A LONG TIME AGO.
- YES, WELL-- - 35 YEARS OF WIND AND SALT SPRAY IN THIS BATTERED OLD FACE; THESE EYES STARING INTO THE BLINDING SUN OR INKY DARKNESS.
BUT THE OLD WALRUS HASN'T LOST HIS BARK.
THE SWABBIES STILL JUMP AT THE SOUND OF HIS VOICE.
HARD TO PORT, ALL FULL AHEAD!
AREN'T YOU GONNA WRITE ANY OF THIS DOWN?
YES, BUT-- WRITE IT DOWN?
!
NO, CAPTAIN, YOU SEE, I JUST WANTED TO TALK WITH YOU.
WAIT A MINUTE.
AREN'T YOU THE FELLOW FROM THE MAGAZINE?
I DON'T THINK I UNDERSTAND YOU, CAPTAIN.
THE MAN FROM "TIME" MAGAZINE, THE ONE WHO'S GONNA INTERVIEW ME.
I THINK YOU'VE MADE A MISTAKE, SIR.
OF COURSE.
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE WAITED SO LONG.
THEY'VE NEVER WRITTEN ME UP.
NIMITZ, HALSEY, RICKOVER.
ALL OF THEM.
THE ADMIRALS, THE CAPTAINS, THE COMMODORES, ALL OF THEM BUT ME.
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- YOU'RE SORRY!
IT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY!
YOU HAVEN'T SPENT A LIFETIME AT SEA!
HATING IT!
SEASICK ALL THE TIME!
THE SOUND OF THE WAVES!
THE CONSTANT DAMPNESS!
THE ROLLING OF THE SHIP!
UP AND DOWN AND UP AND DOWN!
AND UP AND DOWN-- I'M SORRY, CAPTAIN, BUT DO YOU MIND IF I SIT DOWN FOR A MOMENT?
OF COURSE.
NOW, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?
WELL, CAPTAIN, I NEED YOUR HELP.
BUT FIRST I MUST REVEAL TO YOU SOME INFORMATION THAT IS HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL.
YOU MAY CONSIDER ME THE SOUL OF DISCRETION.
MY NAME IS MAXWELL SMART.
I SHALL NEVER BREATHE IT TO ANOTHER LIVING SOUL.
- UH, NO, SIR, THAT'S NOT IT.
- PLEASE CONTINUE.
WELL, YOU SEE I'M A SECRET AGENT WORKING FOR - CONTROL.
- CONTROL?
YOU WORK FOR CONTROL?
- YOU'VE HEARD OF IT?
- NO.
OH.
CAPTAIN, SOMEBODY ONBOARD YOUR SHIP HAS STOLEN THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP.
MR.
SMART, I CAN VOUCH FOR MY CREW.
I KNOW EACH MAN AS THOUGH HE WERE MY OWN BROTHER.
WHY, THEY'RE THE PICK OF THE SCUM OF EUROPE!
WELL YOU SEE, SIR, IT'S NOT ONE OF YOUR CREW.
IT'S ONE OF THE PASSENGERS.
WHOEVER IT IS HAS ALREADY KILLED TWO MEN, ONE RIGHT HERE ONBOARD THIS SHIP LAST NIGHT!
YOU MEAN THERE IS A DEAD PERSON ONBOARD MY SHIP?
- YES SIR.
- HMM.
THAT MAY BE AN OMEN OF BAD LUCK.
ISN'T THAT KIND OF AN OLD SUPERSTITION, CAPTAIN?
TRY TELLING THAT TO THE CORPSE!
YES.
CAPTAIN, I'VE GOT TO GET THOSE PLANS BACK.
SO FAR THE KILLER AND THIEF HAS ONLY LEFT ME ONE CLUE-- AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THAT YET.
AND WHAT'S THAT, SIR?
WELL, WHEN HE WALKS HE MAKES A STRANGE KIND OF A CLIP-CLOP SOUND.
- A CLIP-CLOP SOUND?
- YES, A CLIP-CLOP SOUND.
REST ASSURED, SIR I SHALL DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO ASSIST YOU.
MY SERVANT MING CAN HELP US.
PERHAPS YOU'VE SEEN HIM.
OH YES, THE BIG CHINESE FELLA.
CHINESE?
GOOD HEAVENS, OF COURSE!
HE'S CHINESE!
I WONDERED WHY HE WAS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND.
I THOUGHT HE HAD A SPEECH IMPEDIMENT.
YES.
WELL, THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP, CAPTAIN.
DON'T THANK ME, SIR.
IT'LL BE A PLEASURE TO HELP YOU.
PERHAPS IT WILL RELIEVE THE MONOTONY OF THE VOYAGE.
AND I SHALL LISTEN FOR THAT SOUND YOU TOLD ME ABOUT.
YES, A CLIP-CLOP NOISE.
YES, A CLIP-CLOP NOISE.
- YES, MAX.
- HELLO, 99?
I JUST TRIED TO CALL YOU AND YOUR LINE WAS BUSY.
OH, I'M SORRY.
I WAS CLEANING MY GUN.
WELL BE CAREFUL.
ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN AROUND HERE.
MAX, DID YOU FIND OUT ANYTHING FROM CAPTAIN GROMAN?
NO, BUT HE'S GONNA TRY AND HELP US.
HOLD IT, 99.
THERE'S A MESSAGE WRITTEN ON MY PORTHOLE.
MUST BE FROM 44.
MAX, THERE'S A MESSAGE ON MY PORTHOLE TOO.
MINE SAYS, "UNLESS PURSUED, OPEN NO DOORS".
AND MINE SAYS, "EELS CAN KILL, NOT ONLY WOUND".
I THINK 44 IS FINALLY CRACKING UP.
MAX, IT MUST BE SOME KIND OF CODE.
HE MUST BE TRYING TO TELL US SOMETHING.
Max: But what?
MAX, TELL ME THE FIRST LETTER OF EVERY WORD IN YOUR MESSAGE.
"U, P, O, N, D." AND MINE ARE "E, C, K, N, O, W." AND PUT THEM ALL TOGETHER AND THEY SPELL MAX!
"UP ON DECK NOW".
TO MEET HIM!
RIGHT, 99.
NOW LISTEN TO ME AND LISTEN TO ME VERY CAREFULLY-- WE'VE GOT TO GET UP THERE AND CONTACT 44.
BUT I WANT YOU TO LEAVE YOUR STATEROOM WITHOUT BEING OBSERVED BY ANYBODY.
- HAVE YOU GOT THAT?
- RIGHT, MAX.
- I'LL SEE YOU UP THERE THEN.
- RIGHT.
OVER AND OUT.
-  - 44?
WE'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE, MAX.
I DON'T THINK HE'S UP HERE.
NEITHER DO I. - WHO ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR AGENT 44.
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG TO GET HERE?
FIRST OF ALL WE HAD TO DECODE THAT MESSAGE YOU LEFT ON THE PORTHOLE.
OH, WAS IT HARD?
YOU KNOW, SECRET MESSAGES ARE ONE OF MY SPECIALTIES.
I'VE SEEN HARDER.
MAX FIGURED IT OUT RIGHT AWAY.
WELL, YOU WAIT UNTIL NEXT TIME.
I'VE GOT A HUMDINGER.
YOU'LL NEVER GET IT.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT, 44?
WHAT GOOD IS A SECRET MESSAGE IF NOBODY CAN UNDERSTAND IT?
LISTEN, 86, I DON'T HAVE MUCH FUN ON THIS JOB.
THERE'S NO MINGLING WITH THE GLAMOROUS PASSENGERS, NO DECK TENNIS, NO GALA EVENINGS AT THE CAPTAIN'S TABLE.
NO NO, NOT FOR ME.
TAKE IT EASY, 44.
TAKE IT EASY.
I MEAN, A SPY CAN ONLY TAKE SO MUCH-- FUNNELS AND PORTHOLES AND SLEEPING IN THE CARGO HOLD.
HIDING, ALWAYS HIDING!
I WANT TO COME IN FROM THE COLD!
WE UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL, 44, HONESTLY WE DO.
BUT YOU'VE REALLY GOT TO TRY TO GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.
HERE, BLOW.
TAKE IT EASY, 44.
NOW WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL US?
- YOU WON'T TELL THEM ABOUT THIS BACK AT HEADQUARTERS?
- OH, OF COURSE NOT.
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH.
THE CHIEF WOULDN'T LIKE IT.
SOMETIMES IT HELPS TO HAVE A GOOD CRY.
TRY TELLING THAT TO THE CHIEF.
HE HATES TO HAVE HIS MEN CRY.
- HE'S RIGHT, YOU KNOW.
- IT'LL BE OUR SECRET.
YOU'RE VERY UNDERSTANDING.
DON'T YOU HAVE SOME KIND OF SECRET INFORMATION FOR US?
OH YES, ALMOST FORGOT.
YOU KNOW THAT PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER?
- HECTOR BACCARDO.
- THE ONE IN THE WHEELCHAIR.
RIGHT.
WELL HE'S NOT WHAT HE PRETENDS TO BE.
- I KNEW IT, I KNEW IT!
- HE'S POLISH.
OF COURSE.
PORTUGUESE ARE TERRIBLE POLO PLAYERS!
AND HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT THOSE STOLEN PLANS.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?
- I WAS UP ON DECK TODAY TAKING A LITTLE SUNTAN IN THAT SMOKESTACK OVER THERE.
BACCARDO WAS TALKING TO THAT SENORITA MERENDEZ.
- WHAT WERE THEY TALKING ABOUT?
- ABOUT THE PLANS.
HE SAID TO HER THAT IF YOU'LL HELP ME I'LL MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE.
- GO ON.
WHAT ELSE?
- AND HE SAID THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW WHERE THE PLANS WERE HIDDEN BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T PLANS.
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
- I THINK I KNOW.
WELL, GO AHEAD AND TELL US.
I BET YOU DON'T THINK I'M SO INEPT NOW, DO YOU?
I NEVER SAID YOU WERE INEPT, 44.
NO NO, BUT I CAN READ BETWEEN THE LINES.
LOOK, 44, ARE YOU GONNA TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW?
NO.
IF YOU DON'T TELL US WHAT YOU KNOW I'M GONNA TELL THE CHIEF ABOUT YOUR CRYING.
- YOU WOULDN'T.
- JUST TRY ME.
OKAY, HERE IT IS-- IF THE PLANS AREN'T PLANS, THEN THEY'RE PROBABLY-- -  -  AND TAKE CARE OF 44.
- I'M GOING AFTER HIM.
- BE CAREFUL, MAX.
COME ON, 44, I'LL GET YOU OUT OF THERE.
HOLD ON, NOW.
BACCARDO!
WELL, I SEE YOU CAN WALK.
NOT ONLY CAN I WALK, MR.
SMART, BUT I CAN ALSO KILL.
I'M WARNING YOU, GET AWAY FROM THAT WHEELCHAIR.
MISSED!
AND YOU'RE ALL OUT OF WHEELCHAIRS.
WHAT ELSE HAVE YOU GOT UP YOUR SLEEVE, BACCARDO?
I HAD TO ASK.
MAX!
BACCARDO!
HE'S OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR.
YES, AND HE'S BEEN ACTING VERY SUSPICIOUSLY.
AND KEEP AN EYE ON HIM.
I'M GOING TO MAKE A COMPLETE REPORT OF THIS TO THE CAPTAIN AND SEE IF I CAN USE THE SHIP'S RADIO TO CONTACT CONTROL.
RIGHT, MAX.
- CAPTAIN!
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
CAPTAIN, THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.
I MUST USE YOUR RADIO.
YOU CAN'T GET ANY GOOD STATIONS THIS FAR OUT, MR.
SMART.
IF YOU CAN'T SLEEP I SUGGEST YOU TAKE A PILL.
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, CAPTAIN.
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'VE BARGED INTO MY QUARTERS WITHOUT AN INVITATION, SIR.
THAT'S WHAT I UNDERSTAND.
CAPTAIN, I HAVE TO USE YOUR SHORTWAVE.
I MUST CONTACT MY HEADQUARTERS.
I BELIEVE I HAVE FOUND THE MAN WHO STOLE THE PLANS FOR THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP!
HAVE YOU?
HAVE YOU INDEED, SIR?
THIS IS MOST INTERESTING NEWS.
AND WHO MIGHT THAT PERSON BE?
HECTOR BACCARDO, THE CRIPPLED PORTUGUESE POLO PLAYER WHO IS NOT A CRIPPLE, WHO IS NOT PORTUGUESE, AND WHO IS PROBABLY NOT A POLO PLAYER.
A VILLAIN!
I SENSED IT THE MOMENT I SET EYES ON HIM.
MR.
SMART, I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE RADIO ROOM MYSELF.
WHAT'S THE MATTER, SIR?
WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT?
IS IT MY LEG?
NO, I'VE SEEN LEGS BEFORE.
IT'S THAT WOODEN JOB I'M LOOKING AT.
AH YES, A SOUVENIR OF MY YOUNGER YEARS, WHEN I WAS STILL A LAD.
YOU'VE HEARD OF THE GREAT WHITE WHALE.
THAT WAS DONE BY THE GREAT WHITE WHALE?
NO, THAT WAS DONE BY A SMALL BLUE CONVERTIBLE.
AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT?
YES, AND IT RUINED A PROMISING CAREER AS A TAP DANCER.
BUT THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE-- AH YES, THAT CLIP-CLOP NOISE.
YOU MENTIONED THAT BEFORE.
WHAT IS IT AGAIN?
IT'S THE NOISE THE KILLER MADE WHEN HE WALKED.
CERTAINLY, SIR, I AM NOT UNDER SUSPICION.
AFTER ALL, I WAS ON THE BRIDGE STEERING THE SHIP WHEN THAT MAN WAS STABBED IN HIS CABIN.
THEN HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WAS STABBED?
DID I SAY STABBED?
I MEANT KILLED.
CAPTAIN GROMAN, I THINK YOU AND I BETTER HAVE A LITTLE TALK.
YOU FOOL!
LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!
YOU'VE RUINED MY MODEL.
I'LL HAVE YOU FLOGGED, KEELHAULED-- I'LL SUE YOU!
SO THAT'S IT!
THE NUCLEAR AMPHIBIAN BATTLESHIP MADE INTO A MODEL!
ALL RIGHT, GROMAN, GET BEHIND THE DESK.
COME ON, MOVE OUT.
YOU'LL NEVER GET OFF THIS SHIP ALIVE.
LISTEN, IF I DON'T GET OFF THIS SHIP ALIVE, YOU'RE IN A LOT OF TROUBLE.
OF COURSE, I'M IN A LOT OF TROUBLE TOO, BUT ON THE OTHER HAND--  EXCUSE ME.
MY PHONE IS RINGING.
HELLO, 99?
DROP THE PHONE, SMART!
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, GROMAN.
YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE OUT OF LINE.
DON'T MOVE!
THIS IS A .
45 CALIBER LEG - AND IT'S LOADED.
- OF COURSE!
THE OLD GUN-IN- THE-PEG-LEG TRICK.
THAT'S THE SECOND TIME I'VE FALLEN FOR IT THIS YEAR.
NOW SAY GOODBYE, MR.
SMART.
-  - MING!
- MAX!
-  GOOD SHOT, 99.
MAX, IT WAS CAPTAIN GROMAN.
YES, ONE OF THE MOST CLEVER AND INGENIOUS VILLAINS I'VE EVER ENCOUNTERED.
IT WAS HE WHO STOLE THE PLANS, KILLED OUR WATERFRONT CONTACT MAN, MURDERED INSPECTOR SEHOKIAN, ALMOST FED ME TO THE SHARKS, WOUNDED AGENT 44, TRIED TO SHOOT ME WITH ONE LEG AND STAB ME WITH ANOTHER.
YOU KNOW, IT'S A SHAME, 99.
- ALL THIS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED.
- HOW?
IF ONLY HE HAD ONLY USED HIS LEG FOR GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.
CHIEF, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TAKE THE HELICOPTER BACK?
WHY DON'T YOU SAIL BACK WITH US, CHIEF?
IT'D BE A NICE REST FOR YOU.
NO, I WANT TO GET THAT MODEL BACK TO WASHINGTON.
I'LL LEAVE LARRABEE TO WATCH THE OTHER PASSENGERS.
LARRABEE, GO BELOW AND KEEP AN EYE ON 'EM.
GOOD IDEA, CHIEF.
THOSE FREELANCE SPIES ARE REALLY A SHIFTY LOT.
AT LEAST WE GOT BACCARDO ON AN ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE.
YES, I GUESS HE THOUGHT I HAD THE PLANS AND WAS JUST WAITING FOR A CHANCE TO STEAL THEM.
- HOW'S 44, CHIEF?
- OH, HE'S ALL RIGHT.
IT WAS ONLY A SUPERFICIAL WOUND.
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE HIM AN ASSIGNMENT ON LAND FOR A WHILE.
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
HE'S A NICE FELLOW.
YES, HE'S A GOOD AGENT.
IF ONLY HE COULD BREAK THAT CRYING HABIT.
YES, I'VE TOLD HIM ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
WATCH IT, CHIEF!
THAT'S WHERE I WENT OVERBOARD.
OH, REALLY?
IT LOOKS SOLID NOW.
THEY MUST HAVE FIXED IT UP.
THIS IS WHERE THE BULLETS HIT-- -  -  CHIEF!
MAX, I DON'T BELIEVE SOME OF THE THINGS YOU DO!
I DON'T BELIEVE-- MAX, DO SOMETHING, QUICK!
HANG ON, CHIEF!
HOLD ON.
MAX IS COMING!
HERE IT COMES, CHIEF!
HOLD ON, CHIEF.
THAT'S IT.
- HERE WE GO.
- Max: HANG ON, CHIEF!
- THAT'S IT, CHIEF.
- JUST A LITTLE WAYS MORE.
HAVE YOU GOT A GOOD GRIP, MAX?
MY HANDS ARE SLIPPING, CHIEF.
I'VE GOTTA WIPE THEM OFF.
GO RIGHT AHEAD, MAX.
SORRY ABOUT THAT!
MAX!
OH HANG ON, MAX!
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
THIS IS ONE OF OUR LATEST CREATIONS.
I'M SURE YOU'LL FIND IT QUITE SMART.
SMART?
YES YES, IT IS SMART.
I GOT HERE AS SOON AS I COULD.
YOU DID?
THAT'S NICE.
NOW THIS GOWN SELLS FOR ONLY $886.
- 800 AND WHAT?
- 86.
-GOTCHA.
- IT'S A REAL BARGAIN.
MAY I SUGGEST YOU BUY IT?
- I'LL TAKE IT.
- YOU WILL?
YES, AND YOUR COUNTRY IS INDEBTED TO YOU FOR THIS.
I WENT THROUGH EVERY INCH OF IT AND THERE ARE NO HIDDEN PLANS IN THIS GOWN.
MAX, YOU'VE SPENT OVER 800 OF THE DEPARTMENT'S MONEY FOR NOTHING!
WELL, THAT'S STRANGE, CHIEF.
THIS GIRL PHONED ME AND TOLD ME SHE WORKED AS A MODEL AT RICHELIEU'S AND THAT SHE HAD INFORMATION CONCERNING THE STOLEN PLANS FOR THE NEW SUPERSONIC BOMBER.
- AND SHE WOULDN'T GIVE YOU HER NAME?
- SHE WOULDN'T EVEN TELL ME WHAT SHE LOOKED LIKE.
SHE SAID SHE'D KNOW ME.
I MUST HAVE SPOKEN TO THE WRONG MODEL.
I'D BETTER GO BACK.
WELL, ALL RIGHT, JUST BE SURE THAT IF YOU BUY ANYTHING - IT ABSOLUTELY MUST CONTAIN THE STOLEN PLANS!
- RIGHT, CHIEF.
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THIS GOWN BACK AND SEE IF I CAN EXCHANGE IT?
- THEY'D NEVER EXCHANGE THAT, MAX.
- OH.
WELL, MAYBE I CAN TELL THEM THAT WHEN I OPENED THE BOX THE GOODS WERE DAMAGED.
MR.
RICHELIEU SPENT A LONG TIME PLANNING THIS GOWN.
IT'S HIS SUPER CREATION.
PLANNING SUP-- GOOD GOOD.
NOTICE THE LOW-CUT FRONT.
WHEN A WOMAN WEARS THIS, EVERYWHERE SHE GOES SHE'LL CREATE CHAOS.
KAOS.
I READ YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFULLY MADE.
YOU'D BE SURPRISED AT WHAT WENT INTO THIS GOWN.
I'LL TAKE IT.
THE COST IS $1400.
I'LL PERSONALLY SEE THAT YOU GET A CITATION FROM THE PRESIDENT FOR THIS.
THAT'S $2260.
YOU'VE JUST BROKEN THE ALL-TIME SHOPPING RECORD.
I DON'T UNDERSTAND, CHIEF.
EVERYTHING THAT MODEL SAID SOUNDED LIKE THE PLANS WERE HIDDEN IN THIS GOWN.
FORGET IT , MAX, YOU'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG TREE.
I DON'T THINK SO, CHIEF.
LET'S LOOK AT THE SITUATION CALMLY.
NOW WE KNOW THAT KAOS HAS THE STOLEN PLANS AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT RICHELIEU HAS BEEN TIED IN WITH KAOS FOR A LONG TIME NOW.
NOW ADD THIS TO THE TELEPHONE CALL I RECEIVED FROM THE MODEL AND IT ALL ADDS UP.
LOOK, CHIEF, WHY DON'T YOU GIVE ME ANOTHER CHANCE?
LET ME GO BACK TO THE STORE AND I PROMISE YOU I WON'T BUY ANOTHER THING.
WELL, ALL RIGHT.
BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME.
NOW REMEMBER, NOW THAT WE KNOW THAT KAOS IS IN POSSESSION OF THE STOLEN PLANS, WHAT WE HAVE TO FIND OUT IS HOW THEY INTEND TO SMUGGLE THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY AND WHEN.
YES WELL, WHAT YOU'RE SAYING, CHIEF, IS THAT NOW THAT WE KNOW HOW, ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIND OUT WHO, WHEN AND WHERE.
NO, FORGET ABOUT WHERE.
WHEN WE FIND OUT HOW, WE'LL KNOW WHERE.
WELL, HOW WILL HOW TELL US WHERE?
IF IT'S GOING BY BOAT, IT'S PROBABLY GOING TO RICHELIEU'S SALON IN BEIRUT, WHICH IS A SEAPORT.
IF IT'S GOING BY PLANE, IT'LL PROBABLY GO TO HIS SALON IN DAMASCUS.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
YES, I UNDERSTAND, CHIEF, BUT I DON'T THINK I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU.
YOU SEE, ALL YOU'VE TOLD ME IS THAT WE KNOW HOW, BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHO, WHEN OR WHERE.
SO THAT TELLS US THAT WE DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.
WHAT?
WELL, WE KNOW WHO AND THAT DOESN'T TELL US WHEN SO WHY SHOULD HOW TELL US WHERE?
MAX, YOU'RE DRIVING ME CRAZY.
HOW?
- DON'T SAY THAT WORD!
- WHY?
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO MODEL THIS OUTFIT FOR YOU, SIR?
I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T LOOK TOO GOOD IN KNICKERS.
WHAT KEPT YOU, MR.
SMART?
I PHONED YOU HOURS AGO.
- YOU'RE THE ONE?
- YES.
MY NAME IS MILDRED SPENCER.
I THINK THEY'RE ONTO ME AND MY LIFE MAY BE IN DANGER, SO LISTEN CAREFULLY.
THE STOLEN PLANS ARE HERE IN THE SALON.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW THEY INTEND TO SMUGGLE THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY?
PRETEND TO BE INTERESTED IN THIS OUTFIT AND I'LL TELL YOU HOW, WHEN AND WHERE.
NEVER MIND WHERE, JUST TELL ME HOW AND WHEN.
HOW WILL TELL ME WHERE, NOW THAT WE KNOW WHO.
SUPPOSE WE CONCENTRATE ON HOW.
WHAT?
DON'T GIVE ME ANY NEW WORDS.
WE'RE WORKING ON HOW.
JUST HOW IS KAOS GOING TO GET THOSE PLANS OUT OF THE COUNTRY?
I'LL HAVE TO CHANGE MY CLOTHES.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
YOU GO AHEAD.
WHILE YOU'RE DOING THAT I'LL CONTACT HEADQUARTERS - AND ORDER AN M-4.
- WHAT'S AN M-4?
A COMPLETE MOBILIZATION RAID.
I'LL HAVE EVERY AVAILABLE CONTROL AGENT SWARMING OVER THIS PLACE WITHIN 10 MINUTES.
DON'T WORRY, MISS SPENCER, WITH MAXWELL SMART ON THE JOB YOU'RE LIFE IS IN NO DANGER AT ALL.
I BEG YOUR PARDON, MONSIEUR, BUT I HAVE NOTICED YOU STANDING HERE FOR SOME TIME NOW.
COULD I BE OF SOME HELP?
UH, NO, THANK YOU, I-- I'M JUST WAITING FOR MY WIFE.
WE'RE GOING TO BUY A COUPLE OF DRESSES.
EH, SHE'S GOING TO BUY A COUPLE OF DRESSES.
-  - OH, I SEE.
THAT MAY BE HER COMING NOW.
YES, THAT'S HER.
SHE JUST PARKED.
EXCUSE ME.
EVERYBODY STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
THIS IS A GOVERNMENT RAID.
-  - CHIEF, WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?
WE TRIED TO SURROUND THE BUILDING, BUT SOME NUMBSKULL PARKED HIS CAR IN THE ALLEY AND TOOK THE KEYS.
OH, WELL HERE, GIVE THIS TO ONE OF THE MEN AND HAVE THEM MOVE IT.
LARRABEE.
I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING, MAX, ORDERING AN M-4.
AN ALL-OUT MOBILIZATION RAID LIKE THIS COSTS THE DEPARTMENT A FORTUNE.
WELL, IT'S WELL WORTH IT, CHIEF.
I'M ABOUT TO CRACK THIS CASE WIDE OPEN.
THE MODEL TOLD ME THAT THE STOLEN PLANS ARE RIGHT HERE IN THE SALON.
- DID SHE SAY WHERE?
- WELL NO, SHE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO.
SHE WAS CALLED AWAY.
THAT WAS 30 MINUTES AGO AND SHE HASN'T RETURNED YET.
SHE WENT RIGHT THROUGH THOSE DRAPES.
- LET'S GO IN THERE.
- COME ON, MEN, FOLLOW ME.
NO!
YOU MUST NOT GO IN THERE.
- OH, AND WHY NOT?
- IT IS THE MODELS' DRESSING ROOM.
ALL THE GIRLS ARE UNDRESSED.
HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!
HOLD IT!
JUST A MINUTE.
I'M SURPRISED AT YOU MEN.
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE CONTROL AGENTS.
NOW LET'S JUST LINE UP HERE IN SINGLE FILE, TALLEST MAN IN THE REAR.
AND REMEMBER, I WAS HERE FIRST.
CHIEF, I THINK YOU'RE A LITTLE TALLER THAN I AM, SO YOU CAN STAND RIGHT ABOUT HERE.
MAX!
YOU MEN GO BACK TO YOUR POSITIONS AND DON'T LET ANYONE IN OR OUT OF THIS PLACE.
-  - NOW THERE'S NO NEED TO BE ALARMED, LADIES, - JUST STAY RIGHT WHERE YOU ARE.
- AND DON'T ANYBODY MOVE.
YOU MOVED.
THAT'S BETTER.
ALL RIGHT, MAX, WHICH ONE IS SHE?
SHE ISN'T HERE.
OUR APOLOGIES FOR THIS INTERRUPTION, LADIES.
I SHOULD THINK SO.
MAX!
PERHAPS, IF YOU GENTLEMEN WOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH TO TELL ME WHO YOU ARE LOOKING FOR, I COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE.
WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE OF YOUR MODELS, RICHELIEU.
SHE MODELED A GOWN FOR ME EARLIER AND NOW SHE SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED.
OH, YOU MUST MEAN MADEMOISELLE SPENCER.
THAT'S IT, CHIEF.
THAT'S THE GIRL, SPENCER.
HOW UNFORTUNATE.
SHE RECEIVED AN URGENT TELEPHONE CALL, HAD TO CATCH A FLIGHT IMMEDIATELY.
DEATH IN THE FAMILY, I BELIEVE.
THAT'S FUNNY.
SHE DIDN'T-- WAIT A MINUTE.
HAD TO LEAVE IMMEDIATELY, EH?
THEN WHAT DO YOU CALL THIS?
THAT'S HER, CHIEF.
MAX, THAT'S A-- A MANNEQUIN.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, CHIEF.
THE GIRL IS JUST PARALYZED WITH FEAR.
COME ON OUT OF THERE, MISS SPENCER.
COME ON, DON'T BE AFRAID.
COME ON OUT.
OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
CHIEF, IT IS A MANNEQUIN, BUT IT LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE HER.
IT IS HER, CHIEF.
MAX, IT'S A MANNEQUIN, A DUMMY!
BUT SHE CALLED ME ON THE PHONE!
THIS MANNEQUIN TELEPHONED YOU?
YES.
WELL, THE MANNEQUIN DIDN'T PHONE ME, BUT THE MODEL DID.
PLEASE, MAX, DON'T MAKE IT ANY WORSE.
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY FOR THIS INCONVENIENCE, MR.
RICHELIEU.
- IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO-- - THERE CERTAINLY IS.
YOU CAN REMOVE YOUR TROOPS FROM MY PREMISES IMMEDIATELY AND THE NEXT TIME HE DESIRES TO HAVE A HALLUCINATION, SEE TO IT THAT HE HAS IT IN SOME SANITARIUM.
JUST WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE HE WAS GETTING AT, CHIEF?
MAX, YOU'VE BEEN WORKING TOO HARD.
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IN FOR A SERIES OF TESTS?
TESTS?
I DON'T NEED ANY TESTS, CHIEF.
BESIDES, I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF A CASE.
I CAN'T TAKE OUT TIME TO GO OUT AND TAKE A LOT OF SILLY TESTS.
THERE IS NO CASE FOR YOU ANYMORE, MAX.
I'M GONNA HAVE TO REMOVE YOU FROM ACTIVE DUTY AND PUT YOU BEHIND A DESK, - AT LEAST UNTIL I CAN EXPLAIN THIS TO THE DEPARTMENT.
- EXPLAIN WHAT?
HOW YOU ORDERED AN ALL-OUT MOBILIZATION RAID BASED ON INFORMATION SUPPLIED TO YOU BY A MANNEQUIN!
BUT, CHIEF, YOU CAN BACK MY STORY UP.
YOU DON'T REALLY BELIEVE THAT I ACTUALLY HAD A CONVERSATION WITH A MANNEQUIN!
ARE YOU COMING, MAX?
DON'T WORRY, I'LL STRAIGHTEN EVERYTHING OUT.
YOU JUST STAY RIGHT HERE.
LUCHEK, YOU'RE A FOOL!
I TOLD YOU TO HIDE HER IN THE STORE ROOM WHERE NOBODY WOULD FIND HER.
THERE WAS NO TIME.
I WAS BARELY ABLE TO SPRAY HER WITH THE PLASTIC SOLUTION AND TURN HER INTO A MANNEQUIN BEFORE THEY ARRIVED.
- IS SHE DEAD YET?
- MOST DEFINITELY.
THE SOLUTION HARDENS IN 20 MINUTES.
CONTACT MY SALON IN BEIRUT.
INFORM THEM THERE WILL BE A DELAY IN OUR PLANS.
OH YES, TO EASE THEIR DISAPPOINTMENT, - TELL THEM THE GOOD NEWS.
- WHAT GOOD NEWS?
THAT MAXWELL SMART IS NO LONGER AN ACTIVE CONTROL AGENT.
OH, MAX, I'M TERRIBLY SORRY THAT I HAD TO BE THE ONE TO COME AND COLLECT YOUR EQUIPMENT.
IS THAT EVERYTHING?
EVERYTHING EXCEPT MY SHOE PHONE AND I'M NOT GIVING THAT UP.
I STILL HAVE THREE MESSAGE UNITS LEFT ON IT.
UNDERSTAND IT.
THAT GIRL KNEW RICHELIEU HAD THE STOLEN PLANS AND SOMEHOW SHE DISCOVERED HOW HE INTENDED TO SMUGGLE THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
AND BEFORE SHE COULD TELL YOU THEY TURNED HER INTO A MANNEQUIN.
- BUT HOW, MAX?
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAX, WHATEVER SECRET SHE DISCOVERED IS STILL HIDDEN IN THE SALON.
NOW WITH HER GONE THEY'RE GONNA NEED ANOTHER MODEL.
SUPPOSING I TAKE THE JOB.
- YOU?
- WELL, WHAT'S SO SURPRISING?
I WAS A HIGH-FASHION MODEL BEFORE I BECAME AN AGENT AT CONTROL.
WATCH.
WELL?
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SELLING, 99, BUT I'LL TAKE TWO OF EACH.
I KNOW THE MAN THAT SUPPLIES THE MODELS TO RICHELIEU.
HE CAN GET ME THE JOB.
NO.
NO, 99.
I CAN'T LET YOU DO IT.
IT'S TOO RISKY.
NO, IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION.
AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT YOU CAN SAY OR DO THAT WILL MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND.
THAT'S FINAL, THAT SETTLES IT, THAT IS IT!
- BUT, MAX, I WANT TO.
- OKAY.
GOOD.
I'LL FIND OUT HOW THEY'RE GETTING THE PLANS OUT.
NOW WAIT A MINUTE, 99.
WE KNOW WHO AND WHY.
NOW ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS FIND OUT WHERE AND WHEN.
SO LET'S FORGET ABOUT HOW FOR NOW.
GOOD THINKING I THINK.
UH, HOW ARE WE GONNA CONTACT EACH OTHER?
OH, WELL, USE MY COMMUNICATION DEVICES, LOOK.
NOW THIS LOOKS LIKE AN ORDINARY SPRAY COLOGNE BOTTLE, RIGHT?
BUT ACTUALLY IT'S A HIGH-FREQUENCY TRANSMITTER.
YOU PUSH IT DOWN TO TALK, YOU RELEASE IT TO RECEIVE.
NOW THIS LIPSTICK IS A HOMING DEVICE THAT SENDS OUT RADAR SIGNALS AND THIS HAIRBRUSH IS ACTUALLY A .
32-CALIBER REVOLVER.
JUST BRUSH THREE STROKES AND THEN IT FIRES.
HERE, YOU TAKE IT.
I HAVE OTHERS.
WAIT A MINUTE, 99.
I CAN'T GO WALKING AROUND TOWN CARRYING A LADY'S PURSE.
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT, OF COURSE.
BESIDES, IT CLASHES WITH MY BLUE SHIRT.
SNAP IT UP, DEAR.
RICHELIEU ABSOLUTELY FLIPS IF YOU KEEP CUSTOMERS WAITING.
OH, I-- I'LL BE ALONG IN JUST A MINUTE.
THIS IS 99 CALLING 86.
COME IN, 86.
COME IN, 86.
MAX, PLEASE COME IN.
HELLO, 99.
THIS IS 86.
MAX, WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG?
I'VE BEEN HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE WITH YOUR COLOGNE PHONE.
EVERY TIME I PRESS DOWN, IT SPRAYS ME IN THE FACE.
THAT'S TO CONCEAL ITS TRUE PURPOSE.
I'M AWARE OF THAT, 99.
WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING WITH YOU?
I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING FROM YOU SINCE YOU'VE BEEN ON THE JOB.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
RICHELIEU'S LATEST CREATIONS ARE NOT GOING TO BE SHOWN HERE.
THEY'VE BEEN PACKED AND SLATED FOR SHIPMENT TO BEIRUT TONIGHT, MAX.
AND LISTEN, YOU WERE RIGHT ABOUT THAT MODEL, BUT I CAN'T TALK NOW, MAX.
I'VE GOT TO SEE YOU RIGHT AWAY.
I'LL BE RIGHT OVER.
OH, AND MAX, WEAR A BLACK SUIT, A BLACK BOWLER AND CARRY A BLACK UMBRELLA.
THERE'S A MALE MANNEQUIN ON DISPLAY HERE THAT'S DRESSED JUST LIKE THAT.
I CAN HIDE IT AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE ITS PLACE IN THE DISPLAY.
THEN LATER ON AFTER THE SHOP CLOSES, WE CAN SNEAK INTO THE STORE ROOM AND TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE DRESSES.
GOOD IDEA, 99.
AND JUST SO NOBODY WILL RECOGNIZE ME, I'LL DISGUISE MY FACE.
BUT MAX, IF YOU DISGUISE YOUR FACE, HOW WILL I RECOGNIZE YOU?
JUST LOOK FOR A MAN WHO SMELLS LIKE A WOMAN.
WHY ARE YOU NOT OUT THERE WITH THE OTHERS?
OH, UM, I JUST FORGOT MY COMPACT.
SOMETHING WRONG?
I'M NOT SURE.
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MODEL THAT DISTURBS ME.
WELL, THE RESULTS OF HER SECURITY CHECK SHOULD BE HERE AT ANY MOMENT AND TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE I'VE PREPARED SOME FRESH SOLUTION OF THE PLASTIC SPRAY.
MAX.
MAX?
YES, IT'S ME, 99.
OH, MAX, YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY DASHING!
YOU LIKE IT, HUH?
OH, I'D LOVE TO SEE YOU IN THAT TYPE OF CLOTHES MORE OFTEN.
YOU LOOK SO WORLDLY AND DIGNIFIED.
YES, WELL, I'VE ALWAYS FELT THAT I WAS-- STOP DISCUSSING MY WARDROBE?
COME OVER HERE AND TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE FOUND OUT.
RIGHT.
LISTEN, MAX, WE CAN DEFINITELY PROVE THAT YOU WERE NOT TALKING TO A MANNEQUIN.
THAT GIRL WAS ALIVE.
BUT SHE KNEW TOO MUCH, SO THEY SPRAYED HER WITH A PLASTIC CEMENT SOLUTION THAT HARDENS IN 20 MINUTES, THAT SMOTHERS THE PORES AND CAUSES DEATH BY SUFFOCATION.
THAT'S INCREDIBLE, 99!
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT?
I OVERHEARD LUCHEK AND RICHELIEU TALKING.
DID YOU HEAR THEM SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE PLANS FOR THE SUPERSONIC BOMBER?
NO, BUT I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING IT'S TIED UP - WITH THAT DRESS SHIPMENT.
- WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?
BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY'RE GUARDING THOSE CARTONS IN THE STORE ROOM.
- THEY WON'T LET ANYONE NEAR THEM.
- STILL, 99, WE CAN'T CONFISCATE THAT SHIPMENT UNTIL WE FIND OUT HOW THOSE PLANS ARE BEING SMUGGLED OUT IN THOSE DRESSES.
BEIRUT!
THEY'RE GOING TO BEIRUT.
YES, WELL-- SO WHAT?
DIDN'T YOU SAY IF WE KNEW HOW, WE'D KNOW WHERE?
WELL, NOW THAT WE KNOW WHERE, DOESN'T IT WORK IN THE REVERSE AND TELL US HOW?
I SAID THAT?
A LONG HARD CASE.
- PLEASE DON'T CONFUSE ME.
-  MAX, LOOK.
THEY'RE CLOSING UP, MAX.
I DIDN'T REALIZE IT WAS SO LATE.
QUICK, YOU GET IN THE DISPLAY AND I'LL HIDE THE MANNEQUIN.
AHA!
I SEE THE NEW RAINWEAR DISPLAY IS COMPLETED.
IT'S MOST STRIKING.
I WONDER WHY HILDA HAS LEFT THE MALE MANNEQUIN WITH THE UMBRELLA UNOPENED.
Luchek: IT MUST BE A WATERPROOF SUIT.
I MUST COMPLIMENT HILDA.
WHERE IS SHE?
IN THE BASEMENT.
SHE WENT TO TURN THE SWITCH ON FOR THE SPECIAL EFFECTS TO MAKE SURE THE DISPLAY IS WORKING PROPERLY.
AH, YOU SEE?
THE EFFECT OF LIGHTNING AS WOULD ACCOMPANY A THUNDERSTORM.
MOST CREATIVE.
LUCHEK, HAS THE SHIPMENT BEEN PLACED ON THE TRUCK?
YES, AND THE TRUCK IS ON ITS WAY TO THE AIR TERMINAL.
Richelieu: WELL, LUCHEK, IT WON'T BE LONG NOW BEFORE WE ARE ON THE MIDNIGHT PLANE TO BEIRUT WITH THE DRESSES, OR SHOULD I SAY THE PLANS?
YOU ARE A GENIUS, RICHELIEU.
TO THINK OF TRANSFERRING THE PLANS TO MICROTHREAD AND THEN USING THE MICROTHREAD TO SEAM THE DRESSES-- IT'S BRILLIANT.
WITH THIS METHOD, WE CAN CONTINUE TO SMUGGLE ALL THE VITAL INFORMATION WE CAN GET OUT HANDS ON.
WELL, LUCHEK, WE STILL HAVE A SHORT TIME.
THERE'S A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE IN MY OFFICE.
OPEN IT AND WE'LL DRINK A TOAST TO OUR SUCCESS.
A SPLENDID SUGGESTION, RICHELIEU.
DID YOU LIKE IT, MR.
RICHELIEU?
HILDA, I MUST COMPLIMENT YOU ON YOUR MAGNIFICENT DISPLAY.
- HILDA, LOOK.
- WHAT IS IT?
THAT MANNEQUIN IS SOAKING WET.
I THOUGHT THE SUIT WAS WATERPROOF.
NO NO, SOMEONE MUST HAVE TAMPERED WITH HIS UMBRELLA.
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE OPEN OVER HIS HEAD.
WELL, CHANGE THOSE WET CLOTHES FOR SOME DRY ONES.
RIGHT AWAY.
YOU KNOW, IT'S STRANGE.
I DON'T RECALL HAVING A MANNEQUIN WITH A BEARD IN STOCK.
- RICHELIEU.
- THAT WOULD BE ALL, HILDA.
THAT NEW MODEL-- I JUST CAUGHT HER - TRYING TO BREAK INTO THE STORE ROOM.
- THE STORE ROOM.
EVIDENTLY SHE'S BEEN PLACED THERE BY CONTROL.
- SHE MUST BE SILENCED IMMEDIATELY.
- I'VE ALREADY SEEN TO IT.
I KNOCKED HER UNCONSCIOUS AND SPRAYED HER WITH THE PLASTIC SOLUTION.
- SHE'LL BE DEAD IN 20 MINUTES.
- EXCELLENT.
WE LEAVE FOR THE AIRPORT IMMEDIATELY.
WE'LL TAKE THE DRESSES ON AN EARLIER FLIGHT TO BEIRUT.
HELLO, CHIEF?
THIS IS 86.
NOW LISTEN, AND LISTEN CAREFULLY.
I WANT YOU TO GET RIGHT OUT TO THE AIRPORT AND PICK UP RICHELIEU AND HIS GANG AND CONFISCATE THE SHIPMENT OF DRESSES DESTINED FOR BEIRUT.
NOW LISTEN CLOSELY, CHIEF.
THE DRESSES ARE SEWN TOGETHER WITH MICROTHREAD WHICH CONTAIN THE STOLEN PLANS.
NO, CHIEF, I HAVEN'T BEEN TALKING TO ANY MORE MANNEQUINS, BUT IF I DON'T HURRY, I HAD A FEELING I HAD LEFT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS, MR.
SMART.
YOU'D BETTER HURRY OR YOU'LL MISS YOUR PLANE, LUCHEK.
I'LL BE ON MY WAY AS SOON AS I TAKE CARE OF YOU, MR.
SMART.
OH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I KNOW.
BEFORE YOU DO THAT, I'D LIKE TO ASK - ONE LAST FAVOR.
- WHAT IS IT?
WELL, I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND A LITTLE VAIN, BUT COULD I BRUSH MY HAIR?
AS LONG AS I'M GOING TO BE A STATUE, I'D LIKE TO LOOK NICE.
GO AHEAD.
I HATE A MESSY CORPSE.
I'LL GIVE YOU FIVE SECONDS.
-  -  POOR DEVILS, THEY'VE ALL BEEN SPRAYED.
STILL GOT A FEW MINUTES.
BUT HOW AM I GONNA MELT THE PLASTIC?
HEAT.
THAT'S IT, HEAT.
I'VE GOTTA GET YOU TO SOMEPLACE THAT'S HOT.
IT'S RIGHT IN HERE, SIR.
I COULDN'T STOP HIM.
HE THREATENED ME WITH A HAIRBRUSH.
I COULD GET MY LICENSE TAKEN AWAY FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.
- OH, CHIEF.
- 99, WHAT'S GOING ON?
MAX BROUGHT ME HERE TO MELT ME DOWN.
TO WHAT?
OH, I CAN'T EXPLAIN NOW.
THERE'S NO TIME.
THAT'S A LADY!
THIS IS A MEN'S STEAM BATH, AND SHE'S A LADY!
WOULD SOMEBODY PLEASE TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON!
LOOK.
YOU'VE GOTTA WARM UP.
COME ON, EVERYBODY, WARM UP.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
COME ON, WARM UP.
YOU'VE GOTTA MELT.
ALL OF YOUR, COME ON.
WARM UP.
WARM UP.
YOU'VE GOTTA MELT IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR ANY OF YOU.
COME ON NOW, WARM UP.
IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR YOU.
WARM UP, COME ON.
ABSOLUTELY AND TOTALLY INEXCUSABLE.
AND BOTH OF YOU ARE GUILTY OF WILLFULLY DISREGARDING CONTROL REGULATIONS.
YOU, 99-- FOR ENTERING INTO A CASE WHICH YOU ARE NOT OFFICIALLY ASSIGNED TO.
I'M SORRY, CHIEF.
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP MAX.
THAT'S RIGHT, CHIEF.
SHE WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP MAX.
I CAN HEAR.
AND YOU, 86-- WHO GAVE YOU PERMISSION TO REMAIN ON THAT CASE?
YOU WERE TEMPORARILY REMOVED FROM ACTIVE DUTY.
WELL, CHIEF, IF I WAITED FOR YOU TO REINSTATE ME, THE REST OF HER LIFE AS A DUMMY IN A STORE WINDOW.
WELL, I HOPE I'VE MADE MYSELF CLEAR.
AND NOW THAT I'VE OFFICIALLY REPRIMANDED YOU, I'D LIKE TO UNOFFICIALLY CONGRATULATE YOU.
YOU BOTH DID AN EXCELLENT JOB ON A MOST DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CASE.
THANK YOU, CHIEF.
AND MAX, YOU ARE RETURNED TO ACTIVE DUTY AS OF NOW.
THANK YOU, CHIEF.
OH, AND ONE MORE THING-- YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT WHERE.
- I WAS WRONG ABOUT WHAT?
- NOT WHAT, WHERE.
YOU SEE, KNOWING HOW THE SHIPMENT WAS SENT DIDN'T TELL US WHO, IT ONLY TOLD US WHY.
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?
HOW AND WHEN DIDN'T TELL US WHAT AND WHERE.
YOU TOO?
IT'S SIMPLE.
WHEN WE KNEW WHAT AND HOW, WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN AND WHERE.
NO, WHY AND WHO TOLD US WHEN AND WHERE.
THAT'S RIGHT.
AND HOW AND WHAT
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
HELLO.
THIS IS MAXWELL SMART, SECRET AGENT 86 OF CONTROL.
I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOUR AGENT 81 WHO WAS KILLED.
HE TOLD ME IF ANYTHING HAPPENS TO HIM I must contact you.
I have names of enemy agents.
HOLD ON JUST A SECOND.
ALL RIGHT, GO AHEAD.
I WAS TOLD TO GIVE YOU NAMES IN PERSON.
I AM WITH SWIMMING TEAM WHICH IS MEETING YOUR AMERICAN GIRLS IN WASHINGTON.
WHERE CAN I CONTACT YOU?
WE WILL BE TRAINING AT THE INTERNATIONAL SPORTS CLUB.
WELL, HOW WILL I RECOGNIZE YOU?
I AM 5'5", HAVE BROWN HAIR-- GO ON, I'M RECORDING EVERY WORD.
WELL, UH, I MAY HAVE MISSED ONE OR TWO.
WOULD YOU MIND STARTING FROM THE BEGINNING?
I GIVE YOU MY NAME.
YOU GET PENCIL.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I HAVE A FANTASTIC MEMORY.
VERNA LENYA TSGANYOKOV.
I'D BETTER GET A PENCIL.
TWO DRAWERS AND ONLY ONE SHOT LEFT.
HELLO.
I HEAR GUNSHOT.
YOU ARE DEAD?
NO, I'M ALL RIGHT.
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR A PENCIL.
I COULDN'T FIND ONE.
YOU'D BETTER JUST GIVE ME YOUR NAME.
VERNA LENYA TSGANYOKOV.
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T MAKE YOU OUT.
WHAT IS YOUR LAST NAME?
TSGANYOKOV.
T-S-G-A-N-- T-S-J-E-A-N-- -  - SOMEONE'S COMING.
I WILL CONTACT YOU AT INTERNATIONAL SPORTS CLUB.
INTERNATIONAL SPORTS CLUB.
I'D BETTER WRITE THAT DOWN.
Man over loudspeaker: Start!
THAT'S THE AMERICAN TEAM, MAX.
THE OTHER TEAM IS OVER THERE.
I'LL SPOT THE GIRL WHO PHONED ME IN A SECOND, CHIEF.
SHE SAID SHE WAS 5'5" AND HAD BROWN HAIR.
THIS MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAN I THOUGHT, CHIEF.
THEN YOU CAN'T IDENTIFY HER, MAX?
UH, NO, CHIEF.
WHOEVER IT IS, I CAN'T WAIT TO CONTACT HER.
MAX, DIDN'T YOU SAY THE GIRL GAVE YOU HER NAME ON THE PHONE?
YES, IT WAS ONE OF THOSE LONG FOREIGN NAMES, BUT I'M SURE I'LL RECOGNIZE IT AS SOON AS I HEAR IT.
I CAN REGISTER THE GIRLS USING MY COVER IDENTITY AS AN OFFICIAL OF THE SWIMMING MEET.
AS SOON AS YOU RECOGNIZE A NAME, YOU LET ME KNOW.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
MAYBE THE GIRL WILL TRY TO SIGNAL YOU, MAX.
I CERTAINLY HOPE SO.
WELL, THAT WAS GOOD, BUT A SWAN MUST LOOK LIKE A SWAN, NOT A VULTURE.
WE WILL WORK ON IT-- UH, I'M HERE TO REGISTER THE GIRLS.
THEY ALREADY HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY REGISTERED.
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD OF AN OFFICIAL OFFICIAL REGISTRATION?
NO.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.
GIVE HIM YOUR NAMES.
YOUR NAMES, PLEASE.
MYRNA LENYA ASKINYAROV.
VERNA YANYA YAKORNIKOV.
RENA LENYA CHAVGANGRIEV.
NINA LENYA GREHORNIKOV.
ALL RIGHT, GIRLS, GO.
MAX, DO YOU KNOW WHICH ONE IT IS?
WELL, I'M NOT SURE, 99, BUT I'VE GOT IT NARROWED DOWN TO TWO POSSIBLES AND TWO MAYBES.
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THAT OTHER MAN.
YOU'RE ALWAYS SUSPICIOUS, GRECO.
SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON HERE.
I'M GOING TO CHECK ON IT.
WHO ARE YOU?
OH, WE'RE WITH THE AMERICAN TEAM.
WE'RE THE CHAPERONE AND THE TRAINER.
I'M THE TRAINER.
YOU DON'T LOOK LIKE A TRAINER TO ME.
IS THAT SO?
WELL, I HAPPEN TO BE AN EXPERT.
WHY, I ONCE TRAINED A GIRL TO SWIM FOUR TIMES!
WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT?
FOUR TIMES!
I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE.
WOULD YOU BELIEVE THREE TIMES ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI?
I DON'T THINK SO.
HOW ABOUT TWICE AROUND THE BATHTUB?
ONCE AROUND THE BATHTUB?
HELLO.
Verna: I can't talk now.
I leave message with names of enemy agents at bottom of swimming pool.
When drapes on dormitory window are closed, - you will know I have left it.
- WAIT.
- NO SIGNAL YET?
- NO, NOTHING, CHIEF.
I WISH IT WOULD COME NOW WHILE THE AREA IS DESERTED.
EVERYBODY'S AT LUNCH.
MAYBE THERE'S BEEN A CHANGE OF PLANS.
WELL, IF SHE HASN'T LEFT THE MESSAGE, THAT MEANS THEY MUST BE WATCHING HER, CHIEF.
YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.
WELL, LET'S GET SOME LUNCH.
OOH, GOOD IDEA, CHIEF.
I'M STARVED.
LOOK, THERE'S THE SIGNAL NOW.
RIGHT.
NOW SHE SAID SHE WOULD LEAVE THE MESSAGE IN THE POOL.
I'D BETTER GO CHANGE INTO MY TRUNKS, CHIEF.
THERE'S NO TIME.
SOMEONE MAY COME.
THE AREA IS DESERTED NOW.
OH, WELL, I'LL TAKE MY CLOTHES OFF THEN.
MAX.
IT'S ALL RIGHT, 99.
THE DRAPES ARE CLOSED.
NOBODY CAN LOOK.
WILL YOU GET INTO THAT POOL NOW?
BOY, CHIEF, THAT WATER'S COLD.
NOW.
NOW?
RIGHT, CHIEF.
UH, WHAT DO YOU THINK, CHIEF-- A HALF GAINER OR A NICE SWAN DIVE?
RIGHT, CHIEF.
I MYSELF AM A LITTLE PARTIAL TO A ONE AND A HALF TWIST WITH A DOUBLE GAINER, BECAUSE--  GET IN THE POOL!
IS THE NOTE IN THE BOTTLE, MAX?
NO, CHIEF, THERE IS NO NOTE.
OH.
MAYBE SOMEBODY CLOSED THE DRAPES ACCIDENTALLY.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, MAX.
WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.
IT WASN'T A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.
THIS IS A DEPOSIT BOTTLE.
I CAN GET A NICKEL BACK ON IT.
IT WAS A GOOD SUGGESTION, EATING OUT HERE, MAX.
AT LEAST WE CAN SEE IF THE GIRL TRIES TO SIGNAL YOU AGAIN.
RIGHT, CHIEF.
CHIEF, THE FOOD HERE IS TERRIBLE.
THIS SANDWICH TASTES LIKE I'M CHEWING ON PAPER.
MAX, THE MESSAGE!
I'M CHEWING ON PAPER.
CHIEF, IT'S THE MESSAGE.
"UNABLE TO LEAVE MESSAGE IN POOL.
THE NAMES OF THE ENEMY AGENTS ARE" - ARE WHAT?
- IN MY STOMACH.
- WHAT?
!
- I ATE THE REST OF THE MESSAGE, CHIEF.
I'D BETTER GO TELL HER I DIDN'T GET IT.
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO, MAX?
DON'T WORRY, I CAN HANDLE IT.
SORRY ABOUT THAT, CHIEF.
UH, PARDON ME, GIRLS, BUT I'VE BEEN EXPECTING A MESSAGE AND I HAVEN'T RECEIVED IT YET.
NOW IN CASE I'M GONE WHEN IT COMES, I'D LIKE TO LEAVE MY TELEPHONE NUMBER.
UH, DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE A PENCIL?
NEVER MIND.
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
EXERCISE.
WHY WAS IT YOU WANTED TO WRITE DOWN YOUR TELEPHONE NUMBER?
WAS IT FOR ONE OF MY GIRLS?
ONE OF YOUR GIRLS?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
OF COURSE NOT.
THE REASON I WANTED TO WRITE DOWN MY TELEPHONE NUMBER WAS FOR-- WAS FOR YOU.
FOR ME?
VY?
"VY"?
YES, WELL-- WELL, BECAUSE IT'S THE LAW OF NATURE.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU ARE A MAN AND I'M A WOMAN-- I MEAN I UNDERSTAND.
DID THE DEFECTOR GET YOUR MESSAGE, MAX?
IT'S IMPORTANT.
- THERE'S SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT.
- WHAT?
I'D LIKE TO MAKE AN OFFICIAL REQUEST TO HAVE MY PHONE NUMBER CHANGED.
I TOLD YOU THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HIM.
HE WAS TRYING TO SIGNAL SOMEONE.
IT'S TIME HE HAS AN  ACCIDENT.
CHIEF, WHOEVER OUR GIRL IS, SHE MUST HAVE UNDERSTOOD ME WHEN I SAID I EXPECTED A MESSAGE.
SORRY ABOUT THAT.
IT DIDN'T KNOW IT WAS LOADED.
OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
YOU KNOW SOMETHING, CHIEF?
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THAT MAN I DON'T TRUST.
CHIEF, SHE'S GOT TO CALL.
SHE'S JUST GOT TO CALL.
DON'T WORRY, MAX.
SHE WILL CALL.
YOU WERE RIGHT, CHIEF.
HELLO.
- It's me.
- GOOD, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOUR CALL.
NOW LISTEN, I'VE GOT TO HAVE A LIST OF THOSE NAMES.
DON'T WORRY, I'LL PROTECT YOU.
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN TO YOU.
All right.
I meet you in area behind training pool in 15 minutes.
RIGHT.
- WELL, THAT'S IT, CHIEF.
- WHAT DID SHE SAY?
SHE'S GONNA MEET ME IN 15 MINUTES.
MAX, PLEASE BE CAREFUL.
YOU'LL BE OUT THERE ALONE, A WALKING TARGET FOR A KILLER.
AND LOVING IT.
IS IT YOU?
YOU!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
WHAT'S THAT PIECE OF PAPER IN YOUR HAND?
WAIT A MINUTE, GRECO.
DON'T ASK ME SO MANY QUESTIONS ALL AT THE SAME TIME.
- HOW DO YOU EXPECT ME TO ANSWER THEM?
- ALL RIGHT.
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
- NOTHING.
- WHO ARE YOU TALKING TO?
- NO ONE.
WHAT'S THAT PIECE OF PAPER IN YOUR HAND?
I DON'T KNOW.
SEE?
NOW WHEN YOU ASK ME THE QUESTIONS ONE AT A TIME NICELY, YOU GET ANSWERS.
WELL, SO LONG, GRECO.
JUST A MINUTE.
GIVE ME THAT PIECE OF PAPER.
GIVE IT TO ME.
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KILL ME TO GET THIS NOTE, GRECO.
THEN I'LL KILL YOU.
IT WAS ONLY A SUGGESTION.
CAN'T YOU LET A GUY EAT IN PEACE?
Trainer: GRECO?
GRECO!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GRECO.
HOPE I WASN'T OUT OF LINE.
GRECO, WHAT IS IT?
I HEARD NOISES DOWN HERE.
ONE OF OUR GIRLS IS MEETING THE TRAINER FROM THE AMERICAN TEAM.
SHE GAVE HIM A NOTE.
I THINK WE SHOULD GO BACK TO THE DORMITORY AND WORK THEM OVER, FIND OUT WHICH ONE IT IS.
NO, WE NEED ALL OF OUR GIRLS FOR THE SWIMMING MEET TOMORROW.
UNTIL THEN WE WON'T LET THEM OUT OF OUR SIGHT.
AND THEN WHEN WE GET BACK TO OUR OWN COUNTRY WE WILL FIND OUT WHO IT IS AND THEN TAKE CARE OF HER.
COME.
YOU-- YOU ATE THOSE NAMES AGAIN?
!
I HAD TO EAT THEM, CHIEF, OTHERWISE GRECO WOULD HAVE GOTTEN THEM.
WHY, HE TRIED TO KILL ME.
IMAGINE THAT.
CHIEF, I'VE GOT TO GET THOSE NAMES.
I'M GOING IN THERE, FIND THAT GIRL AND GET THAT LIST.
I FIGURE IT'LL TAKE ME ABOUT 10 MINUTES.
BUT, MAX, THAT'S A DORMITORY FULL OF WOMEN.
HMM.
BETTER MAKE THAT AN HOUR AND 10 MINUTES.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SHH, I'M WALKING IN MY SLEEP.
- WITH YOUR CLOTHES ON?
- WITH MY CLOTHES ON.
YES, WELL, I ALWAYS WALK IN MY SLEEP WITH MY CLOTHES ON.
YOU SEE, IN CASE I WAKE UP SUDDENLY I LIKE TO TAKE IN A LATE MOVIE.
AS A MATTER OF FACE, I'D BETTER GET GOING, BECAUSE I HATE TO WALK IN ON THE MIDDLE OF A PICTURE.
I KNOW YOU'RE NOT WALKING IN YOUR SLEEP.
DID YOU COME TO SEE ONE OF MY GIRLS?
CERTAINLY NOT!
THEN YOU MUST HAVE COME TO SEE ME, YOU DEAR IMPETUOUS MAN.
COULDN'T YOU WAIT FOR ME TO CALL?
SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUT I-- - WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- WHERE AM I GOING?
YES, WELL, I THOUGHT I'D GO AND GET SOME FLOWERS.
YOU SEE, I HATE TO COME VISITING EMPTY-HANDED.
OH, HOW THOUGHTFUL.
BUT I DO NOT NEED FLOWERS.
NO FLOWERS.
WELL, UH, HOW ABOUT SOME CANDY?
OR BETTER YET, CHINESE FOOD?
I KNOW A WONDERFUL RESTAURANT.
OH, HOW NICE, AN INTIMATE MIDNIGHT SNACK.
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE YOU TO GET TO THE RESTAURANT?
FOUR DAYS.
IT'S IN SHANGHAI.
- SHANGHAI?
- WOULD YOU BELIEVE HONG KONG?
WELL, WHEREVER IT IS, IT'S A LONG TRIP, AND I REALLY BETTER GET GOING.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO KISS ME GOODBYE?
KISS YOU GOODBYE?
YES, WELL, I'LL KISS YOU GOODBYE - WHEN I GET BACK FROM SHANGHAI.
- NOW.
NOW?
UH, YES, WELL, OKAY, IF YOU CLOSE YOUR EYES.
- VY?
- VY?
BECAUSE I'M SHY, THAT'S VY.
KISS ME!
KISS ME!
KISS ME!
KISS ME!
Girls: WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?
WHAT IS THIS NOISE?
- IS HE TRYING TO KILL YOU?
- NO, HE'S TRYING TO KISS ME.
- YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME.
- I THINK YOU'D BETTER COME WITH ME.
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU, I'D RATHER GO WITH THEM.
GET HIM OUT OF HERE!
SORRY ABOUT THAT, GIRLS.
IT WASN'T YOUR FAULT, 86.
YOU DID THE BEST YOU COULD, MAX.
WHAT REALLY BOTHERS ME, CHIEF, IS THAT THAT GIRL MISSED A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.
HOW?
I WAS STANDING RIGHT THERE IN AMONG ALL THOSE GIRLS.
SHE COULD VERY EASILY HAVE SLIPPED THE LIST OF NAMES INTO MY POCKET.
THEN I COULD BE SITTING HERE AND REACH INTO MY POCKET AND COME UP WITH THE LIST OF NAMES.
- WHAT'S THAT, MAX?
- THE LIST OF NAMES, CHIEF.
THE LIST OF NAMES?
WE HAVE WHAT WE CAME FOR.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.
WAIT A MINUTE, CHIEF.
WHAT ABOUT THAT GIRL, THAT BRAVE AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL THAT TRIED TO HELP US?
THEY FIND OUT ABOUT THIS THEY'LL KILL HER.
- BUT MAX-- - NO, 99, I GAVE HER MY PERSONAL GUARANTEE OF SAFETY.
I GAVE HER MY PROMISE THAT I'D PROTECT HER.
THAT'S IT.
I'M GONNA WAIT UNTIL MORNING AND THEN I'M GOING IN THERE.
STOP.
TURN AROUND.
IT'S YOU!
YES, IT'S ME, AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL KNOW THE TRUTH.
I'M FROM CONTROL AND ONE OF YOUR GIRLS GAVE ME A LIST OF ENEMY AGENTS AND I'M HERE TO TAKE HER OUT.
- YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE KILLED.
- I DON'T CARE.
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY DIFFERENCE.
THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT SHE RISKED HER LIFE TO HELP ME AND I GAVE HER MY WORD I'D PROTECT HER.
AND YOU DON'T GO BACK ON YOUR WORD TO A BRAVE AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
- TAKE ME.
- YOU?
I AM THE BRAVE AND BEAUTIFUL GIRL.
YOU ARE?
WELL, HOW CAN I BE SURE OF THAT?
HOW DO I KNOW YOU WERE THE ONE THAT GAVE ME THE LIST?
IS YOUR NAME VANYA LENYA YASKANYOKOV?
NO.
- RENYA LENYA CHAVGANRIEV?
- NO.
- NINA LENYA GRANORAVETH?
- NO.
- VERNA LONYA ANYAAZOV?
- NO.
NO.
WELL, THAT TAKES CARE OF THAT, BECAUSE THE GIRL THAT I KNOW HAS A NAME THAT SOUNDS JUST LIKE THAT.
VERNA LENYA TSGANYOKOV.
THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.
ARE YOU SURE YOU WANNA GO WITH ME?
- YES - ARE YOU PACKED?
- NO.
- NO?
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU GO IN AND PACK AND I'LL COME BACK FOR YOU, SAY, IN A COUPLE OF WEEKS?
NO, WE'D BETTER GO NOW.
GRECO IS SURE TO FIND OUT WHAT I HAVE DONE.
GRECO HAS ALREADY FOUND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE.
GRECO HAS ALREADY FOUND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE-- DROP THE GUN, VERNA.
NOW I'M GOING TO TAKE CARE OF BOTH OF YOU.
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR TROUBLE, GRECO.
AND WHO'S GOING TO GIVE IT TO ME?
RUN!
WAIT A MINUTE, THE GUN!
- THERE ARE GUARDS AT THE GATE.
- HOW ABOUT THE BACK?
NO NO, GUARDS THERE TOO.
THIS WAY.
THERE'S GRECO!
- COME!
- WAIT A MINUTE!
NOW EITHER I'M GONNA RUN AND HIDE OR I'M GONNA STAND AND FIGHT.
HE'S GOT A MACHINE GUN!
THEN RUN AND HIDE.
LISTEN, YOU STAY RIGHT HERE.
I'M GONNA GET UP ON THE HIGH BOARD WHERE HE CAN'T SEE ME.
NOW WHEN HE COMES TO YOU, I'LL JUMP HIM.
WHERE IS HE?
GRECO, WATCH OUT.
HE'S ON THE HIGH BOARD.
HERE, KEEP YOUR EYE ON HER.
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
- TO GET SMART.
IF HE SURFACES, KILL HIM.
-  -  NOW, MR.
SMART -  -  LET THAT BE A LESSON TO YOU, GRECO-- NEVER LOOK A GIFT HORSE IN THE MOUTH.
WELL, CHIEF, WE'RE ALL SET TO GO.
- I'LL GO GET MYRNA.
- IT'S VERNA, MAX.
- VERNA, RIGHT.
- THAT'S THE TROUBLE WITH THIS WHOLE ASSIGNMENT, MAX.
THE NAMES OF THE IRON CURTAIN GIRLS ALL SOUNDED ALIKE.
- YOU READY, MAX?
- JUST A MINUTE, 99.
I'D LIKE TO WISH THE AMERICAN GIRLS GOOD LUCK IN THE SWIMMING MEET.
- CHIEF, DO YOU HAVE THE REGISTRATION LIST?
- YES.
WELL, AT LEAST WE WON'T HAVE ANY TROUBLE WITH THESE GOOD OLD AMERICAN NAMES.
"BOBBY JEAN HARPER, BETTY JUNE PARKER, BONNIE JOAN BOOKER AND BUNNY JANE BAKER".
