They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -Is this where the Addams family lives?
-Yeah.
-You going in there?
-I'm the truant officer.
They've got two kids who have never set foot in school.
Good Iuck, Charlie.
Hello.
Hello.
You must be one of the Addams children.
-I'm Wednesday.
-I'm Mr. Hilliard.
-Are your parents at home?
-They're always at home.
I'd Iike to see them.
You mean you wanna come in?
If you don't mind.
Nice place you've got here, Wednesday.
We Iike it.
It's so nice and gloomy.
Who's that?
That used to be a friend of my daddy's.
Wednesday!
Wednesday.
Here.
I fixed it for you.
Pugsley is very handy.
Fixed her?
That doll doesn't have a head.
It's Marie Antoinette.
Grandmama told us about the French Revolution and Pugsley chopped off her head.
Meet you out in the cemetery.
Mommy is in the conservatory.
Why, you perked up my African strangler.
Come here, darling.
Mommy, this is Mr. Hilliard.
How do you do, Mr. Hilliard.
Mrs. Addams, I was sent here My hemlock has been very Iistless Iately.
Do you know anything about hemlock?
No, Mrs. Addams.
I was sent here to What a pity.
I think I'II run along and bury Marie Antoinette.
Have fun, dear.
Just Iook at my beautiful poison oak.
Every Ieaf so alive.
Mrs. Addams, your children are six and eight years old And growing Iike toadstools.
My hemlock continues to droop.
They've got to attend school.
It's the Iaw.
I'd Iove to discuss that with you, Mr. Hilliard, but you see, I can't.
You must speak to my husband.
The Iaw is his responsibility.
That's quite a bell.
Yes, Gomez is very fond of it.
But we can never use it when we have a cake in the oven.
Hello, Mr. Addams.
I didn't hear you come in.
Lurch is our butler.
He will take you to Mr. Addams.
Couldn't I just stay here?
I'm sure you and I can settle this matter.
On the other hand, perhaps it would be better to see Mr. Addams.
Follow me.
My poor little hemlock.
Where have I failed you?
I know.
You haven't been getting enough moonlight.
Mr. Addams.
Mr. Addams, I am Sam Hilliard from the Sherwood School.
How do you do, Mr. Hilliard?
I just stopped by to talk to you about -They're gonna crash.
-You think so, huh?
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
You meant to blow them up?
Of course.
Why else would a grown man play with trains?
You wanna blow the other bridge?
Some other time.
You know how it is with a small child and new trains.
What can I do for you?
It's about sending the children to school.
Mama's in charge of the education.
She's in the guest room playing darts with Uncle Fester.
But they've got to go to school.
Everybody sends their kids to school.
Ridiculous.
Why have children just to get rid of them?
-I'm opposed to the whole nonsense.
-But don't you want them to Iearn?
Learn, you say?
Look at that.
Little Wednesday's.
-Spiders.
-Pedigreed.
Ever known a child who could raise thoroughbred spiders?
-No.
-There you are.
But I was referring to more formal Iearning.
Reading.
What is there for a six-year-old to read?
-But someday she'II be 26.
-See you then.
Mr. Addams, surely you want your youngsters to be Iike other children.
But they are.
You should see Iittle Pugsley wrestling with his octopus.
-A Iive octopus?
-He's all boy.
What if he bites him?
Mr. Hilliard, Pugsley doesn't bite.
A Iittle nip now and then perhaps.
But it's all in fun.
Well, Iook, this isn't my idea.
The board of education We have our own board of education.
Mama tutors the children in all the fine arts.
Music, painting, ballet.
She's the Ionghair of the family.
And a fantastic dart player.
You only got 10 points.
I nipped him in the ear, didn't I?
Ear?
Watch the master.
You're standing right in my way.
It's the only safe place.
Step aside.
Now watch this one.
Right in the old gizzard.
This is the guest room.
That was close.
Go ahead, Fester, you get another shot.
This time, get him right in the old heart.
-What's the matter with your friend?
-I don't know.
Weird, isn't he?
Then that crazy plant grabbed me.
And you should've seen how happy he was when he blew up the bridge.
And that big monster they call a butler.
He would've frightened Frankenstein.
Now, Mr. Hilliard, really.
I was there.
That knife was aimed straight at my heart.
Now, now, calm down.
But I got away.
PIease try and pull yourself together.
Mr. Hilliard, if you'II take my advice, you'II go home and Iie down for a while.
If you take my advice, you'II Ieave those Addams kids right where they are.
That's the closet.
I'm sorry.
I never knew he drank.
The thorns are so much Iarger this fall.
Lovely, Morticia.
-You have such a way with roses.
-Thank you, Gomez.
Did I just hear a peal of thunder?
You did, Tish.
You did.
That's the most heavenly sound.
It makes Iife worth Iiving.
You remember our honeymoon, Gomez?
Who could forget our first night in Death Valley.
-There was a stillness in the air.
-Tish.
The moon was full.
And that Iovely soft fluttering of bat wings.
And the divine cave.
You're so romantic, Tish.
I think they're waiting for us, Gomez.
The music is so Iovely.
Look, darling.
I finished it this morning.
How do you think cousin Imar is going to Iike his new sweater?
-That's odd.
-What's odd, dear?
I didn't know Cousin Imar wore turtleneck sweaters.
Mmm.
querida.
The mail's in.
Never mind, Lurch.
I'II get it.
Thank you, Thing.
It's for you, Mommy.
Thank you, darling.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
What is it, Tish?
The Sherwood School insists that we enroll the children immediately.
We must've made a very good impression on that Mr. Hilliard.
Morticia, you can't send the children to school.
I'II be Iost without them.
Gomez, I've seen Iittle Wednesday Iooking out the fence at the other children.
I think she wants to play with them.
Well, she didn't get that from my side of the family.
School?
I never went to school, and Iook how I turned out.
Uncle Fester, Iooks, charm and personality aren't everything.
There's such a thing as Iearning and accomplishment.
Accomplishment?
Who else do you know that's 1 10 volts?
Watch!
Beautiful.
I can even make it blink.
You do have natural talent, Uncle Fester.
But that has nothing to do with Iearning or knowledge.
I'II call the school and tell them we'II be there in the morning.
-Morticia.
-Gomez.
Darling.
Mother knows best.
Now, believe me.
We'II send the children to school.
School?
That's for kids.
I'm sure the children are going to be very happy here.
If we wanted them to be happy, we'd have Iet them stay home.
Now, Miss Comstock, I Wasn't that that nice Mr. Hilliard?
He certainly is an odd one, isn't he?
-Have you noticed it, too?
-Yes.
Why, do you know, he suddenly ran out of our house the other day?
Frightened by a simple game of darts.
I'm going to have to have another talk with him.
B-O-O-Z-E.
Booze.
Really?
I guess I underestimated him.
Come along, children.
Be good today, Wednesday, Pugsley.
- AII right.
-Goodbye, children.
Goodbye.
Oh, dear.
I'm going to miss the patter of their Iittle feet sneaking up behind me.
I'm so glad we had no trouble with this.
Of course, these cases bring the superintendent down on our necks.
And he's the most difficult, troublesome man.
Oh?
And there's always one Iike that in the school system.
Well, I know just how to handle it.
You get me his picture and I'II send it to my friend DuBois in Haiti.
When he's through sticking pins in it Gomez.
You haven't heard from DuBois in years.
He may not be taking mail orders anymore.
How about a nice old-fashioned horse whipping?
Good, good.
Or Iet our boa constrictor give him a good squeeze.
A Iittle dip in boiling oil?
Miss Comstock, you're my kind of people.
Tish, what about Goomba in Nairobi?
He gets some wonderful results with just a drum.
-And now that we have Telstar -You're so practical.
Four minutes after 3:00 and they're not here yet.
Are they gonna keep them there for night school?
Gomez, a watched cauldron never bubbles.
They'd be here by now if they Iet Pugsley drive.
By Jove, I think they did.
Wednesday.
What is it, Wednesday?
What is it, darling?
That's it.
There, there, there.
Father, it was terrible.
They killed him.
-Mr. Hilliard?
-The dragon.
What dragon?
Who killed a dragon?
A knight in shining armor.
He killed the dragon.
I can't believe anyone would kill a dragon.
The poor, defenseless dragon.
That isn't all.
You ought to hear some of the other stories in her book.
Let me see that, darling.
Grimm 's Fairy Tales.
What a Iovely name, Grimm.
How could he write such terrible stories?
Must be sick.
Atavistic cruelty.
Perverse barbarism.
Such violence.
Gomez!
That settles it.
No more school.
Good thinking, sir.
That's all right for our children, but what about all the others?
I suppose you're right.
We should do something.
Just as ordinary citizens.
I could call that Miss Comstock.
No.
I'II call that nice Mr. Hilliard and invite him over.
And we'II discuss it with him.
You know, I really think he Iiked us.
Oh, no, no.
Never!
But, Mr. Hilliard, they insist on seeing you.
I'm sorry, I haven't made out my will yet.
What if Mr. Hilliard doesn't come?
Angel, your father sent Lurch for Mr. Hilliard, and it's very difficult for people to refuse Lurch.
He has such a nice way with them.
Now, Iet me see your hands.
Excellent, Pugsley.
The nails are nice and clean and sharp.
And you did very well, too, Wednesday darling.
I think we took a bath for nothing.
Mr. Hilliard.
Mr. Hilliard.
I'm so glad you could come.
Put Mr. Hilliard in the good chair.
That'II be all for now, Lurch.
Children.
You just never know what they're thinking.
I do.
We do have a bone to pick with you, Mr. Hilliard.
Haven't we?
Perhaps I have done some Iittle thing.
Mr. Hilliard, murder is not a Iittle thing.
Murder?
As if you didn't know.
But first, some refreshment.
Mama?
Uncle Fester?
Wait till you see what they've got cooked up for you.
The end.
It figures.
No!
No, thank you.
-We made it especially for you.
-I know, I know.
You must taste the cookies.
An old family recipe.
The bats are my favorites, although the Iizards are good, too.
You can feel them wiggling practically all the way down.
Time to go.
Mr. Hilliard, you're a bundle of nerves.
Isn't there something we can do for him, Gomez?
Of course.
-The rack.
-The rack?
That stretching, so relaxing.
Lurch.
You rang?
The rack for Mr. Hilliard.
No!
PIease!
I just had it overhauled.
I got all the squeaks back in.
If I've caused any trouble We're not really blaming you, Mr. Hilliard.
But there are some things we just can't tolerate.
-Like what?
-Like violence.
Well, what's wrong with a Iittle Violence?
The kind they're teaching the children at school.
You did say, "Teaching the children in school"?
Come now, Mr. Hilliard.
Let's not pretend.
Have you read your friend Grimm Iately?
Those harmless Iittle fairy tales?
Harmless?
Killing a poor defenseless dragon?
But there are no real dragons.
What gave you that impression?
And what about that Hansel and Gretel?
Little Hansel and Gretel?
Little juvenile delinquents.
Pushing sweet old Iadies into hot ovens.
Sweet old That's not what you want to feed Iittle children.
Of course not.
Then why don't you just run right down to the School Board, and tell them to do something about it?
Well, I You know, I'm beginning to think you've got something.
-You are?
Another drink for Mr. Hilliard!
-No, please.
I'm beginning to see your point.
Something must be done.
From dragons to toy guns to real guns to bombs to atom bombs!
You know what?
Thinking Iike yours can save the world.
I must confess I misjudged you people completely.
Thank you.
Do you think he'II convince the School Board?
I don't know.
He's such a weird Iittle man.
Fester, you're not cheating.
I'm sorry.
Pugsley.
He's building Wednesday a Iittle dollhouse.
Why, thank you, Thing.
Hello.
Yes.
Wonderful.
Yes, the children will be in school tomorrow.
Thank you.
That was that nice Mr. Hilliard.
He said the School Board accepted our ideas enthusiastically.
Really?
Well, now, Mr. Hilliard may be right.
We may have saved the world.
Do you think we did the right thing?

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -It's unbelievable.
-Our own son.
He was always such a good boy.
Keeping to the basement, playing with his octopus.
It's terrible.
You must do something about it.
After all, darling, the Addams family honor.
You're right.
Family honor.
Thank you, Thing.
It's worse than I thought.
He's wearing it.
I don't believe it.
I want to see it with my own eyes.
-We've Iost him.
-Can I Iook, Mother?
Certainly not.
Grandmama, take her to her room.
I can't stand these weird things.
I'm gonna sit in my tree house and watch the Iightning.
Our poor boy.
Something's come over him.
What are we going to do?
Darling, I must have time to think.
After all, this isn't some boyish prank Iike setting the house on fire.
You've spoiled the boy, that's what you've done.
-How?
-How?
Well, what other boy has a playroom Iike this?
I don't see any harm in a few simple toys.
You call this rack a simple toy?
Why, this is Iuxury, pure Iuxury.
And how about this battle-ax?
It was the boy's fifth birthday, -and he was so tired of his blowgun.
-Oh, fine.
You know, my father wouldn't even Iet me touch one of these until I was eight.
You know, I didn't become what I am by accident.
I had upbringing Iike no other.
Like no other.
Eight years old.
And how old was he when you gave him this Iittle toy?
That's not Pugsley's, that's Iittle Wednesday's.
Oh, Wednesday's.
You're gonna spoil her, too, huh?
Perhaps we have been pampering them too much.
Well, there's really nothing to worry about.
Oh, yes, there is.
A 10-year-old boy sneaking around in a Boy Scout uniform.
Darling, there's something I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you.
The other afternoon I saw Pugsley playing with a bat.
A bat?
Well, that's more Iike our boy.
A baseball bat.
It's a game played outdoors.
In the sun.
Oh, no.
-You know what I think?
-The boy needs help.
No, tomorrow's another day.
We'II bide our time.
-Maybe he'II come out of it.
-Perhaps you're right.
We can only hope.
Let's go upstairs to bed.
Why, thank you, Thing.
Thank heaven Thing is still normal.
Come along, darling, I want to show you my new nightgown.
-Do you Iike it?
-Adore it.
Tish, Iet's go down to the cave.
That we save for special occasions, bubele.
You know what you do when you call me that.
Well, it just slipped out.
Now control yourself, Gomez.
I'II try.
Let me do that.
You did mine Iast night.
That scent's beautiful.
-Buy a barrel of it.
-That's the only way it comes.
Darling, I'm sorry, I just can't think of anything tonight except our poor Pugsley.
I understand.
Who'd ever thought we'd have a problem child?
I wonder if blondes do have more fun.
Watch it, Tish.
Watch it!
Wonderful.
For a minute there I thought I was going to miss.
I Iove to watch you play with these trains.
It brings out the real you.
It's not the same without Iittle Pugsley.
He's a great train wrecker.
It's a shame to see natural talent go to waste.
Tish, would you Iike to see me blow up three trains?
Oh, darling, you know I would.
But I have to fix your Iunch.
We're having your favorite, eye of newt.
Broiled.
Just a minute, Son.
What's the hurry?
I've got things to do.
I gotta go.
But you forgot to feed Aristotle.
Gomez, have you noticed how Pugsley's been ignoring poor Aristotle Iately?
Well, he does Iook a Iittle pale around the tentacles.
Look at those sad eyes.
I wonder where he went in such a hurry.
Oh, I do hope he went to the mineshaft.
The dankness does things for him.
-Gomez!
-What is it?
He's out there playing with an it.
-Maybe it's a baby armadillo.
-PIease, Iet's not pretend.
We all know what it is.
It's a P-U-P-P-Y.
Lurch.
You rang?
Go get Pugsley and take him to his room.
I wanna have a talk with him.
-He's out there playing with -I know.
Well, maybe we could all Iearn to Iove the Iittle P-U-P-P-Y.
Uncle Fester, go to your room.
-Come with me.
-I can't right now.
- May I come in, Son?
-Just a second.
I hope I'm not interrupting.
No, I wasn't doing anything special.
Good, I thought we'd have a chat.
Maybe a Iittle difficult for you to realize, Pugsley, but I was once a boy your age.
It is a Iittle hard to think of you at 10.
Oh, I was a typical child.
Faced with all the typical temptations.
The important thing, Pugsley, is for a boy not to take a wrong turn.
I'II never forget when I was a boy, I stood in front of Bailey's department store, admiring a display of gaudy uniforms, mess kits, pup tents, those fat Iittle knives.
I often wondered what would have happened if I had tied that first knot.
Gosh, Dad, you might have ended up as a Scoutmaster.
Boy, you're sicker than I thought.
Don't you realize that all he's going to grow up to be is a dog?
-Oh, it went that badly, dear?
-Terrible.
He even called me "Dad".
Thank heaven he's never called me "Mom".
First serious talk I've had with the Iad and I botched it.
-Where did we fail, Gomez?
-Who knows?
I have it.
He's still a baby.
Tonight when I tuck him in, I'II read him something nice and soothing.
"Once upon a midnight dreary "While I pondered, weak and weary "Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten Iore "While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping" Pugsley, darling, you're not Iistening.
The Raven was always one of your favorites.
You said it made you feel so nice and cozy.
I Iike it all right.
I've just got other things on my mind.
Mother knows.
She knows when her Iittle boy is upset.
I'm not upset.
But you are, darling, you're all flushed.
Lost your Iovely pallor.
Now, why don't you put all these strange thoughts out of your mind?
I'II get your alligator.
Oh, you poor dear.
"PIumbers, proxy solicitors, -"psychologist, child".
-Morticia, must we?
Darling, we need help.
Dr. BIack.
BIack?
Well, at Ieast he sounds friendly.
5432 I can see she has a real problem.
It's not Mrs. Addams.
-It's his problem.
-It's our Pugsley.
What is a Pugsley?
Pugsley is our son.
Oh, a child problem.
I've got one of my own.
No wonder you two Iook so You should see how my wife and I Iook some days.
I'II never forget Just what seems to be the trouble?
Well, in the first place, it's those terrible clothes he's been wearing.
-Uh-huh, beatnik.
-That wouldn't be bad.
Really?
But on top of that he's suddenly attached himself to the strangest creature.
-A girl?
-An animal.
The retreat-to-the-forest syndrome.
They all go through these things.
We never did.
Believe me, most parents have the same problem.
Weird clothes and strange pets, all bidding for more attention.
Well, give him a Iittle more.
Cater to his childish whims.
Cater to such outrageous behavior?
And in a few days, you'II have your boy back again.
Well.
Thank you, Doctor.
You modern psychologists certainly have a way of getting to the heart of things.
We do, don't we?
Yes.
Oh, come here, darling.
You want to see me, Mom?
Yes, I always want to see you, darling.
What's closer in this world than a boy and his mother?
A boy and his octopus?
Maybe.
Would you Iike to help me feed CIeopatra?
I can't, Mom.
I have to go up and read.
Now, now, CIeopatra.
Mind your manners, darling.
What is it you're reading, darling?
"How to Become an Eagle Scout.
" Oh, is that about an eagle who carries off a scout?
Don't think so.
Well, read what you please, dear.
Oh, I see you have on your Iovely neckerchief.
-May I try it on?
-Sure.
Now I have to go up and read my manual.
Keep the neckerchief, Mother, I'II get another.
Oh, CIeopatra, there is real tragedy in this house.
Put them back, Lurch.
Doctor's orders.
We must cater to his every whim until this phase passes.
Where did you find him?
He was out in front of the house in that uniform, helping an old Iady across the street.
-Aren't you gonna punish him?
- For what?
The things kids get away with today.
Pugsley, that's certainly a smart-Iooking uniform.
-Mind if I try on the hat?
-Gosh, no, Dad.
-How do I Iook?
-Sharp.
Been a Iong time since you and I have had a real romp with the trains.
Lately we haven't had a chance to be together much, have we?
Guess not.
Remember how we always used to enjoy blowing up the bridge?
Today I've got dynamite under the bridge and the water tower.
You do?
Next time she comes around, you grab the plunger and Iet her rip.
AII right, here she comes.
Got the plunger?
I'm sorry, Dad, I'm just not in the mood.
Morticia, I failed again.
-We've both failed.
-We've Iost touch with him.
Maybe we were thoughtless.
That summer we were too busy to go into the bat cave with him.
Now he throws balls at them.
Dr. BIack, I'm just afraid it's an emergency.
You're going to have to come over.
But we did do as you suggested.
We have catered to his whims.
We have paid attention to him.
But it just doesn't do any good.
You have no idea the strange things he's been bringing into this house.
You're just going to have to come over.
Dr. BIack, I'm so glad you're here.
We've been at our wits' end over our Pugsley.
Just Iook at this mess.
I can see your problem.
Isn't this sickening?
Ghastly.
You told us to cater to him.
Well, this is the result.
Horrible.
I guess I am partly to blame, but I think you went a Iittle too far.
Much too far.
As a matter of fact, this is the most extreme case of over-catering I've ever seen.
Dr. BIack, this is Pugsley's uncle, Fester.
How do youdo?
I see you've been catering to the boy, too.
And how.
Excuse me, those things you're carrying I'm taking them up to Pugsley's room.
Aren't they dangerously Iarge firecrackers for a boy?
Oh, they're not firecrackers, they're dynamite.
Mrs. Addams, I know I'm responsible for what's going on here, but I'm afraid things have gotten too far out of hand.
I better take over.
I think I'II go up and have a talk with the boy.
Very well.
It's the door at the head of the stairs, the one with the baby vultures painted on it.
Come on, Pugsley, Iet's have a blast, just for old times' sake, huh?
Who is it?
It's Dr. BIack, sonny.
Your mommy asked me to have a Iittle chat with you.
Come in, sir.
I think you've done more than your part.
I'II take it from here.
Good Iuck.
You really Iike the way your Uncle Fester Iooks?
Oh, sure.
He Iooks fine.
I can see we're going to have to have quite a chat.
-What's going on?
-He's up there.
-With Pugsley?
-Yes.
Oh, dear.
Maybe we shouldn't have taken his ax away when he was a baby.
He seemed so happy chopping up things.
And it was good exercise.
Wish I knew what was going on up there.
-I'II climb up and take a Iook.
-Excellent idea.
And then we took the rope and we put it around and around -How's it going?
-Oh, great.
You know, that doctor's a Iot smarter than he Iooks.
Thank heaven.
Pugsley's past the crisis.
-Doctor, is everything all right?
-Naturally.
AII that had to be done was to release the boy's inner antagonisms.
See, Morticia?
Pugsley's come through.
Magnificently.
Once again, he's the wonderful boy you both Ioved.
Oh, thank heaven.
Now I can get rid of all this ridiculous mess.
By all means do.
Get your house back to normal.
-Thank you so much, Doctor.
-Goodbye, Mrs. Addams.
Goodbye.
You uncles.
You pamper the children worse than the parents do.
Here's a surprise.
It says Dr. BIack has quit.
-Quit?
Why?
-Going back to school.
I think we should send him a present.
The turtle.
-Something better than that.
-Better than the turtle?
After all, he did give us our boy back.

Nothing more important than physical culture.

No, I can't say that I have.

Darling, you can't have everything.
That's true.
I never thought of that.
I wish you'd get Uncle Fester to join up.
He wouldn't even Iisten.
Something's come over him Iately.
-He's been acting sly, secretive.
-Dear Uncle Fester.
He just improves with age.
How do you Iike this?
Oh, yes.
But I'm not sure about the neck.
Oh?
-Too Iow?
-Too wide.
-For Cousin Eustace?
-I take it back.
I'II get it.
-Don't be Iong.
-I won't.
-I'II wait for you in the conservatory.
-Morticia.
Time has stood still for you, angelito mio.
You Iook even Iovelier than the day I first Iaid eyes on you.
Bubele.
That word.
I'd better go.
You rang?
-Lurch, did you pick up the paper?
-No, sir.
Someone's been stealing it the past four or five days.
Any idea who it is?
Fine Ioyalty.
Uncle Fester.
Thank you, Thing.
If it weren't for you, this place would be a madhouse.
Is mother's baby hungry?
Yeah.
There.
-Morticia.
-Oh, Gomez.
The most touching thing has happened.
Your carnivorous plant put its tentacle around you again.
Tish, I think you've been feeding them altogether too much hamburger.
No, no, no, sweetheart.
It's the trailing arbutus and the creeping midnight crawler.
They're embracing.
Isn't that sweet?
They fell in Iove and intertwined.
But the creeper went to the Ieft and the arbutus went to the right and they choked each other.
What a way to go.
Morticia, I must tell you, Uncle Fester is not himself.
-Oh, is that bad?
-Maybe not.
But he has been interfering with the children's upbringing Iately.
Against my express wishes he promised Iittle Pugsley a Gila monster.
Darling, it's healthy for children to have pets.
-Gila monsters?
-Why not?
They're so expensive.
Dear Uncle Fester.
Generous to a fault.
Mommy, Daddy, come Iook, come Iook.
Look what Uncle Fester got me.
-He had it made especially for me.
-A black widow spider village.
-Isn't that Iovely?
-Just Iike a society of small humans.
-Yeah, they do nothing but fight.
-That's Iife.
-But is this anything for our child?
-Of course not.
She already has many more spiders than she'II ever need.
Have fun, dear.
-Still think we should talk to Uncle Fester.
-Maybe, but gently.
The Iast time we scolded him, he went into his closet and didn't come out for weeks.
It was an act, my dear.
He Ioves his closet.
Interesting, yes.
Very interesting.
Come in.
Was that you talking to yourself, Uncle Fester?
-You've been doing that quite a bit Iately.
-Well, only when I'm alone.
-Uncle Fester -I know what you're going to say.
I've been spoiling the children.
-I guess I Iike to feel wanted.
-But you are wanted.
-And needed.
-Needed?
You wouldn't even Iet me fix that Ieak in the roof.
And my finger fit it perfectly.
Uncle Fester, I told you, that's my favorite Ieak.
And what about you?
There was a time you'd never think of using your electric shaver without connecting it to me.
Well, Gomez felt you've been a bit run-down Iately.
Run-down?
And I can still make it blink, too.
You call that run-down?
Well, the truth is, Uncle Fester, my new shaver is AC -and you're DC.
-Excuses, Excuses.
-I'm sorry.
-Well, you don't have to be.
I've been scanning the Ionely hearts column.
-You haven't.
-You sly old fox, you.
Well, under the circumstances, I thought I'd take a bride.
Uncle Fester, you just can't take one.
You're supposed to find your own.
It's the sporting way, old boy.
You'II be fighting the women off with clubs.
CIubs?
Yeah.
I think I'd Iike that.
Well, I better get on with the Ietter.
Oh, Gomez.
This morning when I woke up and the sky was all dark and cloudy, I knew right then and there that this was going to be a Iovely day.
But I can truthfully say I have never Iet breeding, social position, or Iooks go to my head.
And I'm Iooking forward to meeting someone of the opposite sex with these same qualities.
Signed, Modesty.
Got it?
Excellent.
You have a very delicate handwriting.
Thank you, Thing.
Uncle Fester, we have a surprise for you.
A surprise?
For me?
I know I'm gonna cry.
CIose your eyes.
AII right, Gomez.
I just know I'm gonna cry.
You can open them now.
-We saved it from our wedding.
-It's beautiful.
And you made such a handsome couple.
I do hope my bride will be worthy of all this.
I better mail this Do you think I ought to send a snapshot along?
I believe so.
How about that nice one the city took?
The time you fell asleep on the park bench and they carried you off to the morgue by mistake.
Oh, no.
I was thin then and I had hair.
-I do Iook better now, don't I?
-Much.
-I'II have a new one taken.
-Yes.
But it's imperative that it show your character, your strength, -your nobility.
-We'II have it touched up.
That won't be necessary.
I'II take the picture.
Ready?
No, no, Uncle Fester.
You're smiling.
-Oh, pardon me.
-Just show the natural Addams charm.
Gotcha.
-Much better.
-Much.
Now for the character.
Beautiful.
Now Iet's see that strength.
Magnificent.
Now the piece de resistance, your nobility.
Breathtaking.
Oh, hurry, Gomez, get it before he Ioses it.
AII right.
Hold it, hold it now.
Hold it!
Ready?
Perfect!
I wonder what Uncle Fester's bride will be Iike.
He once went with a girl who Iooked Iike a walrus.
Darling, beauty isn't everything.
You're right.
He's talking about moving after the wedding.
He's found a home in a nice condemned section.
I wonder what their children will be Iike.
Doesn't matter about the boys, but I hope the girls Iook Iike Uncle Fester.
I do wish Grandpa Squint and Aunt Vendetta were still alive.
They'd get such a thrill out of the wedding.
Darling, they are alive.
They are?
They don't Iook it.
-I'd better check.
-You'd better.
-How do you Iike it?
-Like what, old boy?
-Can't you tell?
-A new collar.
Certainly not.
How can you improve on genuine matched gopher?
You're parting your hair just No, that can't be it.
Come on, take a real close Iook.
-I've got it.
You've had your head waxed.
-Yes.
Oh, you men.
You're much fussier than women.
It's hard coat.
Won't crack, scuff or stain.
It's very becoming.
I thought you'd Iike it.
Oh, has the mail come in yet?
Now, now, control yourself, old boy.
You know the mail doesn't come along -until Iater.
-I just can't help it.
I'm a Iovelorn swain wandering around in a Iovely black cloud.
Oh darling, you can't expect an answer to your Ietter yet.
-You only mailed it yesterday.
-Oh, you never know.
There may be someone out there as eager as I am.
Dear Uncle Fester.
I haven't seen him this happy since he blew up the guesthouse.
Mother, Mother.
Oh, hush, Bruno.
You've been so grumpy Iately.
I wish you wouldn't shout so.
Your father's trying to take a nap.
That's all right, I just can't seem to sleep anyway.
Guess I'm excited about Uncle Fester's wedding.
I wanted to show you the present I have for him.
-You Iike it?
-But, darling, I don't see anything.
You're not supposed to.
Uncle Fester says it's the thought that counts.
I'm thinking of a nice friendly cobra.
Isn't that clever?
If we put our minds to it, we can save a fortune.
Yes, Thing?
Why, thank you.
For Uncle Fester?
What is it?
Come on, now.
You can tell me.
I won't tell anyone.
-A shrunken head.
-Just what he wanted.
I do hope your brother Pugsley hasn't forgotten his dear uncle.
He is going to buy something.
He's upstairs getting the money out of his piggybank now.
Oh?
The mail's in.
Uncle Fester, you must give it time.
It's only been one day.
I was sure I'd get an immediate response.
I gave a very full description of myself.
Patience.
Your Miss Right will come along.
Hello.
Well, hello there.
Is your mother home?
-Are you from the Health Department?
-Why?
The neighbors complained about Aristotle getting Ioose.
-Aristotle, what an odd name for a dog.
-Not for a octopus.
No, not for an octopus.
Well, I'm not here about anything Iike that.
I sell cosmetics and toiletries.
Well, then my mom is at home.
Her name is Mrs. Addams.
Thank you.
Say, maybe you could help me make a sale.
What kind of powder does your mommy use?
-Baking powder.
-I mean on her face.
Baking powder.
And Uncle Fester uses a spray-on preservative.
-No, you mean a spray-on deodorant.
-No, preservative.
-To keep young?
-Just to keep.
Well, thank you very much.
You've been very helpful.
She's here.
She didn't even bother to write.
She just packed a bag and came in person.
Oh, this is terrible.
She's not my type at all.
Uncle Fester, I agree she doesn't have your Iooks, but maybe with a nice stringy hairdo she'd be almost presentable.
Oh, no!
That's not enough.
But perhaps, way down deep inside, where it really counts, -she's one of us.
-No, no.
There is no chemistry.
She doesn't do anything for me.
Our Iife together would be a mockery.
Lurch.
Don't go to the door.
Maybe she'II go away.
-Someone at the door.
-Oh, darling, -it's Uncle Fester's mail-order bride.
-Ugly duckling.
-Just doesn't pay to order by mail.
-I better hide.
No, you're not.
You're going to stay right here and face her.
This will be very good experience for you in handling a scheming, grasping woman.
How do you know she's scheming and grasping, Tish?
She came over here with a bag, ready to move right in.
Trying to muscle in on the competition.
How do you do, Mrs. Addams?
I'm Miss Carver.
Yes, won't you come in?
Well, thank you, ma'am.
Thank you very much.
You know, I'm not always greeted so cordially and invited in immediately.
-You do this often?
-Many times a day.
You poor thing.
You mustn't be discouraged.
I always say there's a right one for everyone.
Won't you come in?
Looks Iike you're preparing for some sort of a party.
Every day is a party with us.
Miss Carver, this is my husband, Mr. Addams.
How do you do, Miss Carver?
PIease sit down.
Thank you.
And don't tell me, that gentleman behind you is Uncle Fester.
I know from the description I've received.
-You can't force me.
-Oh, I never use force.
Just gentle persuasion.
And sometimes in difficult cases, I merely give a free sample and Ieave the prospect to think it over.
Miss Carver!
We don't countenance such behavior in this house.
Well, then, I'II be happy to accept cash.
I believe we can quickly convince you that your visit here is quite hopeless.
Don't say that.
Very difficult, yes, but certainly not hopeless.
Let me ask you a few honest and straightforward questions, Miss Carver, and you'II see what we mean.
You've met Uncle Fester.
Do you really think you have something to offer him?
I should say.
Why, I could make a new man of him entirely.
I have a 90-day plan that works wonders.
That's typical of a woman.
You meet the ideal man and right away you try to make him over.
Not make over.
Just enhance and bring out the basic attractiveness which you already have in such abundance.
You poor thing.
You have it bad, haven't you?
-I beg your pardon.
-Well, you just met Uncle Fester and already you're willing to devote your Iife to him.
I do have a Iifetime plan, but I'm sure you'II see a great improvement in just 90 days.
Would you excuse us for a few minutes, please?
A Iittle family conference.
Of course.
Uncle Fester, I think we may have judged Miss Carver too hastily.
-I can't stand her.
-She's crazy about you, old boy.
Darling, you can make her over a Iittle.
Get her a decent wardrobe.
And after she's been out of the sun for a few months she'II Iose that ghastly color.
I've changed my mind.
I don't want to get married.
I guess my standards are just too high.
Uncle Fester, you Ied her on.
Now you go in and be nice to her.
She's probably in an agony of doubt.
Gomez.
Well, have you decided to Iet me give you a demonstration?
-No, I can't go through with it!
-Come now.
Let me show you something exotic for the boudoir.
Don't you dare!
Perhaps you ought to Iet her, Fester.
It might give you a change of heart.
-Gomez!
-There's no harm.
Go on, Fester, Iet yourself go.
Take her in your arms, kiss her.
Might not be so bad if you keep your eyes closed.
-Mr. Addams!
-She's quite right.
-Young Iovers should be alone.
-Young Iovers?
I'm getting out of here.
Fester, I think you've just been jilted.
Consider yourself Iucky, Uncle Fester.
She was a very vain woman.
That case was full of nothing but cosmetics.
And no taste.
Not a bit of baking powder.
Anything interesting in the paper tonight, dear?
Just a situation wanted ad by that Miss Carver.
I suppose she decided against marriage.
Some people just don't have it.
You were very Iucky, Uncle Fester.
I sure was.
This Zen-Yogi is much better than marriage.
-Marvelous, isn't it?
-Yeah, and so economical.
-Economical?
-No shoes.
{END OF EPISODE 03}{START OF EPISODE 04}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family These conventions, they're so exciting!
I remember the first time I voted.
1906.
Now, Mama, you know there was no woman suffrage in 1906.
-That didn't stop me.
-You're a real Addams.
What's all the noise?
The conventions, Morticia, the conventions.
I do wish they wouldn't shout so.
It keeps Iittle Pugsley's octopus awake.
The poor thing's getting rings under his tentacles.
And my African strangler, too.
It just Ioses all desire to strangle anyone.
Thank you, Thing.
Dear Thing.
It sets such a good example for us.
Show-off.
-Uncle Fester!
-I'm sorry.
Now, you know I don't Iike petty jealousies.
Where's Gomez?
He's down in the playroom hanging pictures.
Oh, dear.
I do hope he isn't hanging the picture of Cousin Grisly facing the firing squad down there.
It Iooks so right in the hall.
What are you doing, darling?
Just getting the playroom into the election spirit.
Is he running again?
No, but I thought I'd bring out the pictures of the men we Addamses have supported in the past.
Very appropriate.
-We really backed Landon to the hilt.
-Yes.
I must say he was a very good Ioser.
No better than AI Smith here.
Or Wendell Willkie.
Or Adlai.
Uncle BIight masterminded their campaigns.
OId "Kiss-of-Death" BIight, they called him.
I never quite knew why.
Grandpa Squint says it's an old family nickname.
Grandpa knew his way around the political arena, too.
Abe Lincoln begged him for his support.
But there's the man who got it.
Stephen Douglas.
Darling, with all this natural political talent, shouldn't you be running for public office?
No, we Addamses prefer to think of ourselves as king-makers.
The man I've decided to throw my support to, in every way, is Leonard G. Quimby.
-Howdy, neighbor.
-How do you do?
-Well, I see you've picked your man.
-Yes, I have.
Even heard you made a substantial contribution to his campaign.
It's only money.
Good.
-George Bass is my name.
-Addams here.
-Is all this yours?
-Well, we go back to the cemetery.
We all do, sometime.
It's nice to see citizens taking an interest in the election, even if they have backed the wrong man.
Quimby?
Why, he's our insurance man.
Got us off the hook when my son, Pugsley, accidentally blew up the garage.
But that's neither here nor there.
You're right.
My man promises to modernize the city, put in more streetlights, drain the swamps.
-Drain the swamps?
-That and more.
Well, maybe I have been a Iittle hasty.
-Do you have a picture of your man?
-Do I have a picture of my There he is, the voice of progress.
That's Sam L. Hilliard.
Why, he's an old friend.
I hope the L stands for Lucifer.
-It does, it does.
-Good.
He's a fine man.
Last time he was around here, he went away with the shakes.
I wonder why.
Overworked.
Then you'II vote for him?
We'II do better than that.
We'II go out and campaign for him.
Wonderful!
Wait till I tell Mr. Hilliard.
Here.
Welcome, fellow campaigner.
Sorry, Quimby.
You can sprinkle Iater, Tish.
Take a Iook at this.
-I could have sworn he was bald.
-My dear.
That's another man.
That's our old friend from the School Board, Sam L. Hilliard.
I've changed horses in midstream.
-That's the Addams way.
-Of course.
The L stands for Lucifer.
Very appropriate for a politician.
But, darling, Iook at his platform.
"Modernize the city, put in more streetlights, "drain the swamps!
" Drain our Iovely swamps?
-The man's an extremist.
-querida mia, our swamps are safe.
Mr. Hilliard won't do any of those terrible things.
Don't you realize politicians always make extravagant promises?
Fortunately I can see through their Iittle games.
Darling, you're so clever.
I'm sure Mr. Hilliard will be very happy we've decided to join his campaign.
I can just see his face.
No, no, no.
I want no part of that Addams family.
But they're good for a nice campaign contribution.
You get it.
Look, the public Iikes personal contact with the candidate, you know, the old handshake, the baby kissing.
You've got to go over and welcome them officially.
I'd rather Iose.
You may, if you don't Iay your hands on some more campaign funds.
-Seriously?
-Seriously.
It's still not worth it.
Community pride, public service, civic duty.
I wonder if we're doing the right thing.
Don't you want to save our Iovely swamps?
That is a good cause.
-Besides, elections are fun.
-We should vote more often.
How's this one?
That's nice, Uncle Fester, and very original, too.
-Yours is nice too, my dear.
-Thank you, darling.
-You Ieft the R out of "friend".
-I thought it Iooked better that way.
By Jove, it does.
I wonder why Mr. Hilliard hasn't called to thank us for joining his campaign.
Busy, no doubt.
That reminds me.
I think I'II send Lurch over and invite Hilliard to a Iittle strategy meeting.
Our candidate.
Welcome.
Mr. Hilliard, how nice of you to join us.
We've been up nights just planning and planning for you.
What are you planning?
Show him the wonderful sign you painted for him.
"Everybody's fiend"?
I didn't think you'd notice.
Sit down, Mr. Hilliard, I'II have Lurch serve some refreshments.
You rang?
-Name it, Mr. Hilliard.
Coffee, tea?
-Brew?
Oh, no, thank you.
Won't you sit down, Mr. Hilliard?
Mrs. Addams and I would Iike to discuss some campaign strategy with you.
Look, I just remembered a speaking engagement.
Yes, thank you.
Now then, what's the key to every successful political campaign?
-Money.
-Exactly.
-Gomez is such a brilliant strategist.
-She really knows me.
Sure, sure.
Well, why don't you just make out a check for, say, $5,000?
-A drop in the bucket.
-$10,000?
-$20,000 or nothing.
-$20,000?
We insist.
-Well, if you put it that way.
-We do.
But more important than money is how it's going to be spent.
We have some wonderful ideas.
-Like that sign?
-Better.
Well, why don't you just make out a check and Ieave the campaigning to us.
But these are sure-fire strategies.
Number one: We wanna get our butler, Lurch, on television.
We feel he'II appeal to the women's vote.
Camera moves in.
It's a close-up of Lurch.
Lurch expresses himself on the candidacy of Sam L. Hilliard.
Animal magnetism.
You can't top that.
Tell you what?
Make it $10,000.
Our children can appeal to the junior voters.
Junior voters?
Kids don't vote.
By George, you're right.
How about $5,000?
Gomez, darling, we'II still have to Iet the children go on television.
They'II be so disappointed.
Besides, they wrote such brilliant speeches.
$2,500.
You'II forget all about money when you hear the song that Uncle Fester wrote for you.
A campaign song.
-$1,000.
-Uncle Fester!
Uncle Fester, sing your campaign song for Mr. Hilliard.
-This will kill you.
-Oh, no.
You To the harpsichord, Lurch, we're gonna do the song.
It's the kind of song that gets you right here.
$500.
Don't be a hog help clean up the bog Vote for Sam L. Hilliard He'II stick to the issue he may even kiss you So vote for Sam L. Hilliard Honest and fearless Sam L. is peerless He's a man for whom we stump.
So don't be a goat and just cast your vote For the pride of our city's swamp Well, what do you think?
I think we've got more money than we need.
Uncle Fester can do the song with special effects, too.
He Iights up.
Lights up?
Don't worry about the flickering.
We'II have him recharged.
-I better go.
-You haven't seen anything yet.
-PIease, I'II give you a Iittle money.
-Nonsense.
-I'm really unworthy of your support.
-Twaddle.
I'm a grafter.
You mean all your campaign promises are phony?
-As a $3 bill.
-I got a Iot of $3 bills.
I'm not going to do anything about the streetlights.
-The streets stay dark and gloomy.
-Wonderful.
And the bogs and marshes, I'm gonna make them even boggier.
Capital!
I knew you'd appreciate my Ieveling with you.
We do!
We do, Mr. Hilliard.
I almost forgot the most important thing.
Our party mascot!
-We don't need a party mascot.
-Yes, we do.
The Democrats have their donkey, the Republicans have their elephant.
-Guess what we have?
-I couldn't begin to.
We have Kitty cat.
Kitty.
Here, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty.
Don't frighten the poor dear.
I'II send you a Ietter of apology first thing in the morning.
-Forgot your hat.
-Keep it!
Well, it Iooks Iike we backed the right man.
No question about it.
I'm just sorry about one thing.
-What's that, dear?
-I forgot to register.
"In the course of human events, "there are many moments that try men's souls.
"There are moments of crisis, of tragedy, turmoil, "doubt.
There are even moments" I've put Kitty to sleep.
What does it matter, darling?
He doesn't vote, anyway.
No, no, it's my speech.
Let's go through it.
Start at the beginning.
-"My friends" -Hold it.
That'II never go, dear.
-Get right to the issues.
-You're right.
"One of the major issues of the day is peace".
Well, that's true, dear.
But everybody wants peace.
-Even Mr. Quimby.
-You're right.
"And now, to the matter of taxes.
"Shall we have high taxes?
Or shall we have Iow taxes"?
-Isn't that a dangerous position?
-You're right.
"Which brings us to the question of education" -Nope, much too controversial.
-You're right.
"AIso the question of social welfare"?
"Now we come to the biggest, the most burning issue of the day, "the question of" -You make that out?
-"Question of swamps".
Oh, yes.
"As to the matter of swamps" Darling, the Iess said about that the better.
Very clever, querida, very clever.
-"I thank you".
-Well I know what you're going to say.
After such an enlightening and courageous speech, I shouldn't thank them, they should thank me.
I agree completely.
Now, you all know what you're supposed to do?
Lurch, you hit the swanky Oak Knoll section.
Roger.
-Mama?
-I get off in the business district.
You parade up and down the street with your placard and you blow your bugle.
Uncle Fester, is your assignment clear?
I sing, Iight up and pass out $3 bills.
Remember, the secret word is "dignity".
AII right, Lurch, blast off.
Don't they make a fine-Iooking group?
Mr. Hilliard is as good as elected.
Oak Knoll is in the bag, huh?
Great, keep in touch.
Well, everything Iooks good so far.
Polls say you're a shoo-in.
I wouldn't be if I hadn't got rid of that Addams family.
-PIease, Iet's not mention them again.
-You're right.
Now hop on down to the polls and keep an eye on things.
Right.
-If anything goes wrong, call me.
-Right.
Boss?
Bass.
You better get over here to the Fourth Ward.
The Addamses are Ioose.
As I told you before, ladies and gentlemen, we're speaking to you from the busy intersection ofBroadway and Main.
Well, I've seen election campaigns, but this one beats them all.
Looks Iike we've done it.
Our on-the-spot broadcast today features Wait a minute.
There's candidate Sam Hilliard, and he's chasing a campaign runner down the street with a stick!
-Isn't that Uncle Fester?
-Uncle Yes, he just Iit up!
I better return you to our studios KBHL.
I'm beginning to see things.
Thank you, Mel, and there you see Why would Mr. Hilliard chase Uncle Fester with a stick?
Nonsense, dear.
Didn't you hear the reporter admit he was seeing things?
Of course.
Hilliard will probably be along any minute to express his gratitude.
Boss, you can't go in there.
It's suicide.
-That's my mood exactly.
-But I've got to get those Addamses off the street or I'm sunk.
Well, I'm not going in.
That's the first intelligent thing you've said in the entire campaign.
Get down to the polls and see what's going on.
Right.
-Bass.
-Boss?
Call my mother and tell her not to wait up for me.
Good idea.
-Hilliard, we've been expecting you.
-I should think so.
-I'II take your hat.
-No, no, no, I'm holding on to it this time.
Come on in.
-Mrs. Addams -PIease don't say it.
I will, too, say it!
Mr. Addams and I find expressions of gratitude so embarrassing.
Expressions of gratitude?
Your election will be our reward.
I'm going to turn this whole thing over to a Iawyer.
-A Iawyer?
-Yes.
My card.
Gomez is responsible for putting more criminals behind bars than any other man in the United States.
You, a prosecuting attorney?
Attorney for the defense.
Well, I don't need you for my Iawyer and I don't need you for my campaign manager.
You see, our man's a politician of the old school.
Not only forgets his campaign promises, he forgets his campaigners.
I knew we backed the right horse.
Excuse me.
Thank you, Thing.
Addams here.
Yes, he's here too.
It's for you.
Probably your opponent, Quimby, conceding the election.
-Only a case of election day jitters.
-I hope so.
-Why don't you answer it?
-You answer it.
Of course, old boy.
Addams here.
I'II take the message.
Oh, hello, Bass!
Really?
Some of the first returns are in.
Oak Knoll, eh?
Good.
I see.
Good work, Bass.
-It's a Iandslide.
-For Hilliard?
For Quimby.
76 to nothing.
-I knew it, I knew it.
-Those early returns.
Of course, the Oak Knoll section, upper class snobs, always contrary to the main trend.
I'II get it.
Thank you, Thing.
Darling, you Iook a Iittle tired.
Why don't you just relax?
Hello.
This is Mrs. Addams speaking.
Yes, he's here.
-It's for you again.
-I'm not going near that thing.
I'II take the message.
Oh hello, Mr. Bass.
Really?
It's the 9th Precinct.
Well, that's much better.
Hilliard 6, Quimby 1 10.
-See?
You're beginning to gain.
-I'm ruined.
Ruined!
Come now, Mr. Hilliard, that's the 9th Precinct.
Nothing but Iower class people.
That's not where your strength is.
If that's for me, I don't wanna talk to anybody.
Addams here.
Bass, what's the word?
Come, now, Bass, you can think of another word.
I see.
Well, the middle class section is the most important.
-Fine.
-AII right, Iet me have it.
-If I were you, I'd demand a recount.
-Oh, no.
Hilliard 5, Quimby 204.
Not bad, really.
You only Iost one vote.
I'm sure there's been some fraud.
Yes, Bass admits it.
Too bad they caught him.
I'II get it.
Hello, Mrs. Addams speaking.
Yes, Mr. Quimby.
Mr. Hilliard's here.
I'm afraid he can't come to the phone right now.
What?
Mr. Quimby, I'm sure you're mistaken.
EIectronic computers do not vote.
Mr. Quimby is claiming victory.
-Wonderful.
-What's wonderful about it?
Can't you see, old man?
The trap.
The Achilles' heel.
The Waterloo of every politician.
Overconfidence.
The poor dear.
The sweet smell of success must have been too much for him.
I'm so glad you joined the Zen-Yogi society, darling.
Right, querida.
After a strenuous campaign, at Ieast you can relax.
Every man should Iearn to relax this way.
It's a wonderful gift.
-It says Mr. Hilliard is quitting politics.
-Really?
-Must be his health.
-Must be.
Because it says he's thinking of Ieaving town, too.
As a matter of fact, it says he's thinking of Ieaving the country.
Poor man, I was so sure he'd win.
I guess we got into the campaign too Iate.
Gomez, I'm afraid we failed.
Not according to Quimby.
He says if it wasn't for us, he wouldn't have won.
What a generous thing to say.
Why, thank you, Thing.
Maybe we should have gotten Thing into the campaign.
No, I guess not.
Hello?
This is Mrs. Addams speaking.
Why, hello, Mr. Hilliard.
Really?
Isn't that nice.
Well, thank you.
Goodbye.
That was that nice Mr. Hilliard.
He says he's glad he lost.
The Mayor appointed him head of the School Board.
It's a much better position.
In that case, I'm proud to have served.
Alley-oop!
Oop!
-Where are you going, darling?
-To the playroom.
To add Mr. Hilliard to our illustrious collection.
{END OF EPISODE 04}{START OF EPISODE 05}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family I had no idea Cousin BIeak was such a difficult subject.
You're painting him from memory and it's a magnificent Iikeness.
-Superb!
-Thank you, darling.
There's something about the eyes, I just can't seem to get them.
That Iid droops just a bit too much.
-The right eye or the Ieft?
-The middle one.
Perfect.
That's the Iook that used to get the girls.
Darling, the children are going to be Iate for their birthday party.
Would you ring for Lurch?
-You rang?
-Yes, Lurch.
Would you get the children, please?
We're coming!
We're coming!
-Oh, what's that, darling?
-Harold's birthday present.
A tarantula.
Oh, dear Pugsley.
He's so generous.
That old Addams tradition, a heart of gold.
Well, we'II have to have it gift-wrapped.
Let's see now.
A birthday present.
Festive occasion.
-I think black would be appropriate.
-BIack it is, my dear.
Here, darling, Iet me do that.
You're all thumbs.
Wouldn't that be interesting?
-Lurch, please take the children to the car.
- Yes, madam.
Where are they going?
Whee!
To the Pomeroy boy's birthday party.
You mean those people with the white picket fence and the pink geraniums?
How could you?
There's something to what he says, Morticia.
They are a bit peculiar.
I bet they've got daisies in their backyard.
PIease don't make me ill.
Now, now, now.
We must be tolerant of our neighbors.
Thank you, Thing.
There you are, Pugsley!
Your mother is still the world's best tarantula wrapper.
Now remember, children, not every family is as fortunate as we are.
Not everyone has a beautiful old house Iike ours.
And a car with all the right sounds and smells.
You must be modest about our advantages.
-We'II be good.
-I know you will, darling.
I'm sure Harold will Iove his present.
Bye, children!
Have a good time.
Pugsley, only five pieces of cake, now!
Well, I guess I'd better go in and finish knitting my tea cozy.
Morticia, don't move.
Remember how I carried you across the threshold that first time?
Not only across the threshold, but through the Iiving room and up the stairs and into our room.
And I dropped you only once.
I'II swear these fish seem to know when you're gonna feed them.
They're a Iot more aware than people give them credit for being.
That's breeding.
There's no waste with piranha.
Darling, I think the children are home.
I wonder what the children are doing back so soon?
I don't know.
Why are you home from the party so early?
What happened?
Was there trouble?
A small altercation.
Harold Pomeroy said his family was better than our family.
He said we were a bunch of kooks.
Kooks?
Oh, he couldn't have meant it.
Of course not, how could the child fail to recognize character when he sees it?
I told you the Pomeroys were no good.
With their neat Iittle petunia patches.
Riffraff!
I tell you, they're nothing but riffraff.
Lurch, you better take the children to their rooms.
Yes, madam.
I always did suspect those white plaster ducks out on the Iawn.
Darling, some people have a twisted sense of beauty.
Rude behavior Iike that begins with the parents.
Well, what are you gonna do about it?
Just stand there and take it?
Certainly not.
I'm going to send Pomeroy an insulting Ietter.
Darling, I don't think we should Iend our name to such a thing.
He could sign it, "A friend".
An insulting Ietter signed, "A Friend".
That would be novel.
I think we should turn the other cheek.
No, when people insulted me, I always turned the other cheek.
-Well?
-I ran out of cheeks.
No, there's only one way to settle this.
Uncle Fester!
Uncle Fester, please, not that.
-But, Morticia, the family honor!
-He's right, Morticia, the family honor.
You'II have to challenge Pomeroy to a duel.
No, I'd rather shoot him in the back.
Uncle Fester, that is not the honorable way.
I know, but it's the safe way.
Uncle Fester, I'm ashamed of you.
An Addams doesn't know the meaning of the word fear.
I do.
I'II shoot him in the back.
Uncle Fester, remember the Addams name!
It'II have to be a duel.
With swords?
With victory going to the swiftest, the cunningest, the deadliest.
I'II shoot him in the back.
-Wait, how about pistols?
-Well, that's different -Does he get one, too?
-Naturally.
-Loaded?
-You get one bullet apiece.
In the back.
We have visitors.
It's Mr. Pomeroy.
Little Harold is with him.
-See?
They've come to make peace.
-I hope not.
I'II handle this.
Remember, you took care of the gas inspector.
Darling, why don't we handle this together?
-A Pomeroy does not slam gates.
-I didn't slam it, Dad.
-A Pomeroy does not Iie, either.
-But, Dad Come along.
I'm Cecil B. Pomeroy.
Perhaps you've heard of me.
I'm in oil.
Oh, boiling?
Lubricating.
I wouldn't make Iight of this.
Look at my son Harold.
Fine-Iooking boy.
Nice eyes.
Well, one of them, anyway.
And that's what your hoodlum offspring did with his fists.
Our son used his fists?
AII those karate Iessons wasted!
I'II thank you both to stop joking.
My son has been sorely wounded and I demand an apology.
Very well, Mr. Pomeroy.
If it'II make you happy, I apologize.
Not from you.
From that pugnacious child of yours.
-Him.
-Children.
I understand, Pugsley, that you and Harold engaged in a Iittle tiff this afternoon.
-AII I did was tear his jacket a Iittle.
-You tore my family crest.
Well, you wouldn't have got a sock in the eye if you hadn't said your family was better than our family.
-Our family is better.
-It is not.
Children, children.
I think you ought to apologize to Harold.
I'm sorry I punched you in the eye, Harold.
She must have hit him while his back was turned.
In the eye?
I don't know, it's possible.
Remember my Cousin Curdle?
Yes!
Well, we're sorry about the whole mess, Pomeroy.
Yes, won't you come in and have a cup of tea?
And the children can play together and forget all about their Iittle spat.
-Well -Do come in.
-I'II Iet you ride my jaguar.
-Can I, Dad?
AII right, but stay in the yard.
Don't go into the street.
Oh, we never run the jaguar out in the street.
Come on, Harold.
I'm so glad we got this thing straightened out.
Yes, we're not only neighbors but I find we have some adjoining Iand along the county Iine.
You got stuck, too!
Yes.
That doesn't happen to the Pomeroys usually.
It's one of the things we're proud of.
Matter of fact, we asked Professor Simms to trace our family genealogy back to -Merciful heavens!
What was that?
-Pugsley's jaguar.
Pugsley's You mean that your child is having my son ride a wild animal?
Don't worry, when Fang makes that noise, nobody rides him.
There, you see?
They've already found something else to amuse them.
Nothing Iike the Iaughter of happy children, is there, Pomeroy?
Well, my son has Iittle time for frivolity.
After all, he's being trained to follow in the family Excuse me.
Is that thing real?
Everything in our home is real, Mr. Pomeroy.
Taste!
There's quite a story behind that trophy, Pomeroy.
Cousin Farouk was a skin-diver.
He dived out of a rowboat in an attempt to spear a rare species of eel.
At the same moment a big fish swept up from the depths, also after the eel.
-They were on a collision course.
-The rest is taxidermy.
I did it!
I did it!
Little Pugsley is teaching Harold how to handle dynamite caps.
Dynamite?
There, you see?
Their Iittle spat of this afternoon is all forgotten.
We adults could Iearn a Iot from our children, eh, Pomeroy?
-More tea, Mr. Pomeroy?
-No, thanks.
That thing bit me!
I'm sure you're mistaken, Mr. Pomeroy.
Our birds would never attack Iiving things.
Children, stop playing with that trap door.
Uncle Fester just greased it.
Your trap door?
-In the playroom, for our gallows.
-It's a family heirloom.
- We're sorry, Harold!
-Don't be mad, Harold.
We're sorry we dropped him through the trap door.
Addams, what the devil have they been doing?
Can't you see?
PIaying!
Harold!
Addams, I never wanna see these two Iittle creeps in my home again.
And I promise you that never again will I set foot in this menagerie.
In that case, sir, I'II have to ask you to Ieave.
Ask me?
I can hardly wait to get out of Lurch, show Mr. Pomeroy out.
Addamses, you are kooks.
Calling our children creeps.
Bawling off about his ancestry, his professor, his genealogist.
I could have really have stopped him with a few things about the Addams ancestry!
-Why didn't you?
-I couldn't think of anything.
You're right.
You're right, I should have told him.
But it's been so Iong since I've Iooked into the family records.
Anybody can tell what kind of a family we are.
But to him, we're peasants.
We need proof.
Proof!
And I'II ram it down Mr. BIowhard's throat.
I'II get you your proof, darling.
I'm going to call in a genealogist.
-We'II get his Professor Simms.
-He can trace our family tree.
Trace it?
I know where it is.
Uncle Fester sits in it every day.
The mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
-It's for you, Mommy.
-Thank you, darling.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
It's from Professor Simms, the genealogist.
He says, "Working on a family tree Iike yours should be a real challenge".
We better get all the Addams family heirlooms and records together.
My dear, I've already dug up a Iot of material.
Isn't that beautiful?
-Oh, the old Addams barn.
-Darling, that's Aunt BIemish.
Are you sure?
You maybe right.
-Oh, I don't recognize those two at all.
-That's only one.
Of course, Grandpa SIurp.
I should have known him by his buck teeth.
And receding chin.
He was a handsome devil.
Remember this picture?
-Cousin CIot!
-Just before they threw the switch.
My, he was photogenic.
I'II never forget the day the judge imposed sentence.
CIotty stood there, head high, shoulders back, and said, "It's a bum rap".
An Addams to the end.
Darling, we better get these things ready.
That does it.
I doubt that I could have made one more trip to the attic.
I hope the genealogist's got enough material to work with.
You know, I think we should use more of these Iovely things in the Iiving room.
I didn't know Granduncle Grisly was a traitor.
Oh, yes!
But he only did it for money.
Is Professor Simms still working in the Iibrary?
Yes, darling.
I think you better take these things in to him.
I'II get the doorbell, Lurch.
-I came to return this gift.
-Is there something wrong with it?
I don't know.
Weren't you surprised when you opened it?
I sure was.
It was empty.
Pugsley?
Your birthday present escaped.
Better Iet Harold pick out something else.
Okay.
Come on up to my room, Harold, and pick out what you want.
I'm not supposed to stay.
A call for Master Pomeroy.
Come along, children.
-Hello?
-Did you return the present?
Yes, and I'm getting out of here as fast as I can.
No, no!
Tell them it was all a mistake.
A horrible mistake.
Yes.
Act nice and friendly.
Yes, friendly.
They have some Iand next to mine and my man thinks there's oil on it.
Just act nice and friendly and I'II be over there soon.
My dad said it was all a horrible mistake.
I'm to be nice and friendly.
Oh, that's Iovely.
Pugsley, you must Iet Harold play with your octopus.
Not that friendly.
Oh, don't be a sissy.
Well, all right.
I'II even show you how to juggle meat cleavers.
Morticia, Professor Simms feels he's on the trail of something.
Oh, I do hope it's something gloomy.
For a moment I thought there might be some relationship to the New England Adamses, John and John Quincy.
People often assume that.
It's been a great source of embarrassment to us.
We spell our name with two "D's".
The additional "D" makes the difference.
Good heavens!
Do you suppose that's the reason Mr. Pomeroy thought there was something wrong with us?
-Professor, is something wrong?
-Oh, no.
No, no, that is Well, things do seem a bit off.
I've traced Mrs. Addams back to the early colonial days at Salem, Massachusetts.
Interesting place, Salem.
-They burned witches there, you know.
-Yes.
I'm certainly glad they don't do that today.
And I found a family of Addamses Iiving in a native village far up the Amazon river, deep in the jungle.
But the head of the family seems to have disappeared.
Completely?
Usually they just shrink them.
Yes.
And I've established that one ancestor back in 270 A.D. used this torch to set fire to the Iibrary at AIexandria, Egypt.
Mamoud Khali Pasha Addams, the firebug of the Bosporus.
We should tell Mr. Pomeroy about him.
Oh, the Pomeroy background has quite a few unusual characters, too.
Really?
But I do think that professional ethics forbids me discussing it.
Of course.
Otherwise I would tell you of Pegleg Pomeroy, the scourge of Denver, Erwin Pomeroy, the hanging judge, and Haversham Pomeroy, the BIuebeard of Boston.
Well, what do you know?
It's quite an impressive background.
I don't blame him for feeling superior.
Darling, sometimes you can just misjudge people.
Pomeroy, come in.
-PIease have a cigar.
-Oh, no, thank you.
Mr. Pomeroy.
You know, I believe I owe you both an apology.
Not at all, it's we who owe you an apology.
And I can understand your pride after Iearning about your family background.
-Lovely rug.
-Thank you.
-Do sit down.
-Thank you, thank you.
Delighted.
The children are upstairs playing with Iittle Pugsley's octopus.
-Live, of course.
-How did you know?
Every young boy should have a Iive octopus.
We do think alike, don't we?
True, true.
And as a Iittle peace offering, I'd Iike to take that awful acreage that we both got stuck with off your hands.
Same price you paid for it, of course.
$1,000 an acre.
Let's not talk about business.
Let's talk about our illustrious families.
Why didn't you tell us about Pegleg Pomeroy?
I beg your pardon?
Oh, come, Mr. Pomeroy, we know all about him.
Quite a streak of skullduggery in the Pomeroy Iine, isn't there?
Well, I And don't tell us you're going to deny knowing anything about Grapeshot Pomeroy.
-Pomeroy is a very common name.
-Isn't he the modest one?
I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about.
Aren't you proud of being descended from a pirate?
-I'II pay you $2,000 an acre.
-Isn't he generous?
BIuebeard Pomeroy would be proud of him.
BIuebeard -$3,000 an acre.
-Well, if you insist.
My check will be here first thing in the morning.
-You come back, paleface.
-Oh, isn't that sweet.
Get me away from these barbarians.
He's had a tiring day.
Harold, the Addams family is every bit as good as ours.
Well, BIack Bart and BIoody Addams, true.
-You see?
-Now say goodbye to your Iittle friend.
-Bye.
-Goodbye, Harold.
-Goodbye, Mr. Pomeroy.
-Goodbye.
Harold, you forgot to say goodbye to Kitty.
No!
Now, Harold, we must say goodbye to Kitty.
Here, Kitty.
Here, Kitty.
What happened to the Pomeroys?
These businessmen.
AIways in such a hurry.
Really nice of Pomeroy to take all that worthless Iand off our hands.
How do you know it's worthless, darling?
Well, one thing's certain, there's no oil on it.
It's been checked and rechecked.
Guess he just wanted to apologize for calling us kooks.
Thank you.
Right in the heart!
Morticia, your aim is perfect.
So female.
So deadly.
So Iovely.
Darling, where's Professor Simms?
Do you think?
No, Kitty can't stand the taste of people.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Mama!
I didn't know there was anyone down here in the playroom.
I just came down here to relax.
Uncle Fester!
I see you're relaxing, too.
Very sensible.
Something the matter with that door.
-You rang?
-This door wants attention, Lurch.
Dear Uncle Fester, is there anything I can do for you?
No, I'm very comfortable.
This feels so good.
Thank you, Lurch.
That's much better.
I just Iove creaky doors.
We both thought we'd rest up a bit before going on our spider hunt.
That reminds me, have you seen Iittle Pugsley's octopus?
It's been running all over the house.
Aristotle!
That animal's just plain spoiled.
I know, Mama, but you know how children are with their pets.
That's not right, Morticia.
Children need discipline.
I know, Mama, but they also need Iove.
That's why I Ieft Gomez and Pugsley alone upstairs.
They need some time together.
You know, father and son.
Father, could I go to the circus?
What's come over you, Son?
Why would a healthy American boy wanna go to the circus?
What was that thing you got yourself involved with Iast week?
-The Boy Scouts?
-Oh, yeah.
The Boy Scouts.
-This week it's a circus.
-I'm sorry, Father.
Well, just this once, mainly because he happens to be a friend of mine.
The gorilla?
No, the owner of the circus, Oscar Webber.
I'd rather know Gorgo.
I've got Iots of people friends, but I don't know one gorilla.
Oscar was a sword-swallower when I first met him.
"Oscar, the Human Knife-Nibbler".
That's a nice name, but I'd still rather know Gorgo.
He'd make a wonderful pet.
You're right.
I'II have Lurch get the car ready.
We'II have a grand old time.
We Addamses always had a way with gorillas.
You rang?
The car, Lurch.
I'm taking Pugsley to the circus.
Thanks, Father.
Gomez?
You simply must do something about that bell.
Lurch says he can hardly hear it.
Morticia, I'm taking Pugsley to the circus.
Do you really think you should?
I mean, after all, I'd feel a Iot better if he was home playing in his bat cave.
This circus can't be so bad.
It's Oscar Webber.
You remember Oscar.
Oscar Webber, of course.
But what in the world is he doing with a circus?
-He owns this one.
-Lovely.
You know, I'II never forget the wonderful times we had when we double-dated with him and his girl.
What was her name?
That Irish girl with the pictures all over her.
Tattoo Ralloo Raloora, the IIIustrated Colleen.
That's the one.
I especially Ioved the one that Picasso did on her chest.
Well, you two run along and have fun.
I must say it'II be especially Ionely here with the others off on a spider hunt.
I feel so guilty running out on you, Tish.
Oh, darling, don't.
I'II be busy with my plants.
My coniferons, bless them.
They're eating Iike pigs.
Especially since I switched them from pot roast to hamburger.
Say, why don't you invite some neighbors in?
I would Iike to have that Iovely Miss Magruder.
You know, the one with the beautiful hatchet face.
This is Mrs. Magruder.
Mrs. Addams!
The woman in that strange house.
She wants to join the Ladies' League.
Heavens.
-Inviting us to tea.
-Think we should?
We are on a membership drive.
We'II be delighted.
Oh, yes, we know the house.
The one that Well, it does Iook sort of haunted.
Why, thank you!
And thank you, Thing.
There, that wasn't so difficult, was it?
Darling, being married to you makes me the world's most fortunate woman.
You always were so frank.
- Ready, Pugsley?
-Be right down!
Just want to get some money out of my piggy bank, Father!
Whew!
Ready.
Ready.
Look who we're going to see, Mother.
The mighty Gorgo.
-My, he is a handsome fellow.
-Yeah.
Business really Iooks bad for Mr. Webber.
There he is!
I'm going over to find Mr. Webber.
You go play with the gorilla.
I just couldn't wait to see you, Oscar.
How Iong have you owned the circus?
I bought it three years ago.
But this past season, everything's gone wrong.
The fat Iady fell in Iove.
Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep.
-Lost 240 pounds.
-That could be noticeable.
Then Marvin the Midget, he got himself on a vitamin kick.
Little punk started growing again.
-Oh, no.
-Yeah.
I went along with it for a while.
But when he hit 5'8", I had to fire him.
as the world's tallest midget?
Tried that.
"The World's Skinniest Fat Lady".
But it didn't work.
The only real attraction I got Ieft is Gorgo the gorilla.
I saw him as we came in.
He's quite a fellow.
Good voice.
But even Gorgo doesn't bring in the customers Iike he used to.
If you've seen one gorilla, you've seen them all.
What are you gonna do, Oscar?
Well, I'm gonna close down early tonight and go to Springfield, see if I can pick up a couple of new acts.
The funniest thing happened to me in Springfield.
Wish I could remember what it was.
My word, the afternoon has flown, Oscar.
I must be running along.
It's been a Iot of fun, Gomez.
Now, you promise you'II call us the minute you come back from Springfield.
Morticia and I wanna have you for dinner soon.
We'II prepare something special.
Eye of newt.
-Eye of newt?
-Baked.
Pugsley!
Time to go home.
Fine-Iooking beast, isn't he, Son?
Yeah, we're buddies.
I told you, we Addamses have always had a way with gorillas.
Bye, Gorgo.
I'm so glad Pugsley enjoyed the gorilla.
Fine type.
-Could I hang Gorgo's picture in my room?
-Well, of course you may, darling.
He has such a fine sense of beauty.
-Goodnight, Mother.
-Goodnight, darling.
Goodnight, Father.
-Sweet dreams.
-I hope they're about gorillas.
That boy, cute as a bat's ear.
Gorgo!
It's you, it's really you!
You'II wake the family.
I just wired Oscar in Springfield, told him Gorgo is with us, there's nothing to worry about.
You know, I've been watching him play with Pugsley.
They've been racing to the top of that tree.
-Pugsley's won every time.
-A true Addams.
Of course, the boy has an advantage.
Gorgo can't hang by his teeth Iike our son can.
That's true.
I never thought of that.
A snack for the plants.
No, thank you, Lurch.
They're getting much too fat.
Lurch, have you seen our new houseguest?
-He's the smartest ape I ever met.
-He seems to have Iovely manners.
Sets a fine example for Iittle Pugsley.
Lurch, you will show him the usual Addams hospitality.
Fine man, Lurch, but a bit of a snob.
We've been having such fun.
This is my mother, Gorgo.
He is a playful one, isn't he?
We want you to feel quite at home here.
-Just happy to be here, I guess.
-Pugsley, darling, try to make your friend understand that expressions of gratitude aren't necessary.
And, by all means, forget you were in a cage and just act Iike one of the family.
-I'II bet you youngsters are hungry.
-I'II ring for Lurch.
Lurch, Iunch.
Perhaps a bunch of bananas.
Bring two, I'm going to eat as much as he does.
-Isn't he darling?
-Yes, as I've always said, any boy who Ioves cobras, toads and apes can't be all bad.
I'm so happy.
Oh, no, I'm not.
Angel.
I did so want everything to be all right -when the Iadies come for tea.
-Why shouldn't they be, sweet?
Well, with Mama away, and all my tea Iinens need Iaundering If only I wasn't so busy with my plants.
That is a problem.
The problem is solved.
Me?
Laundry?
-Dear Lurch, I knew you would pitch in.
-It's the old Addams spirit, Lurch.
Yes, sir.
-Now Iet's see, what shall I serve?
-Let's think.
Darling, you're always there with the right suggestion.
Excuse me.
Lurch, to the harpsichord and play.
-While I'm doing the Iaundry?
-No, no, now.
It helps me to think.
Ole.
That's very nice, but you're still missing the wrinkles.
Sorry.
Oh, well, it's all right.
You've never worked as a Iaundress before.
Have you?
I'II try again.
Now, you mustn't be impatient with Gorgo, Lurch.
Very nice, but you're still missing the wrinkles.
Oh, I think I'II do the dining room curtains, too, Lurch.
I should've bought black curtains.
BIack is so much more cheerful.
-Isn't it amazing?
-Congratulations, Gorgo.
Well, Lurch, there are some things you can do and some things an ape can do.
Darling, I'm afraid you hurt poor Lurch's feelings.
AII I said to him was, "Lurch, there are some things you can do "and some things an ape can do".
What could be fairer than that?
I know, dear, but Lurch is very sensitive.
Besides, I think he's jealous of Gorgo.
He probably thinks Gorgo is after his job.
That's absurd.
Lurch has been with us too Iong.
I better explain it to him.
You rang?
Lurch, something been bothering you?
Perhaps you resent our houseguest.
Well, Lurch, you shouldn't, because we feel that you're his equal in every way.
He has talent, true, but you have charm and personality.
No question about it.
Come on, Iet's see you turn a Iittle of it on.
I'd Iike to see the woman who could resist that.
Well, we just wanted you to know how we feel about you.
We hope the feeling's mutual.
-Good.
-That will be all, Lurch.
Darling, you handled that beautifully.
Well, there's nothing Iike a good heart-to-heart talk.
-She's almost finished, Pugsley.
-Looks Iike a real space rocket.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Is someone there?
Addams residence.
One moment please.
-Mrs. Addams.
-Oh, thank you, Lurch.
Ready for the countdown, Pugsley.
Went right through Uncle Fester's room.
Too bad he's not home, he'd have gotten a bang out of it.
That was Mrs. Magruder.
She and Mrs. Page are on their way over.
In that case, I'II take a run over to my dentist.
He's got some wonderful new drills.
But, darling, I did want you to be here when the Iadies arrive.
No, I don't.
I know the effect you have on the opposite sex.
Sometimes it frightens me.
I Iive in constant fear that some woman will steal you away from me.
Banish the fear mi querida.
You are the only cactus in the garden of my Iife.
I'm sure glad gorillas don't act this way.
I'm so delighted you Iadies could come.
-Our pleasure, Mrs. Addams.
-We'd heard so much about your home.
You certainly have some unusual furnishings.
I was afraid the white curtains would give it a dreary Iook.
That's a very unusual clock there.
Oh, thank you.
It keeps perfect time.
Well, I'm afraid it's 10 minutes slow.
What strange plants!
Well, they're really not at their best.
I think they need some more hamburger.
-Hamburger?
-Their favorite food.
Well, I never heard of it as plant food.
I wonder if it would be good for my daisies.
I wouldn't know.
I've never raised daisies.
Won't you Iadies be seated?
If you'II excuse me a moment, I'II see if the tea is ready.
That's excellent.
I'II ring when I want you to serve.
I serve.
-Are you ready for tea?
-Thank you.
That bell!
-Oh, we're having it fixed.
-I should think so.
Oh, thank you, dear.
Gorgo's so handy around the house.
And a fantastic Iaundress.
Now, Iemon, cream or saccharin?
Mrs. Magruder?
Gorgo!
-My sweet, you mustn't be so distressed.
-But I did so want to join their club.
And Gorgo spoiled everything.
You know, I once read somewhere where some people are afraid of gorillas.
Nonsense.
Who could possibly be afraid of a gorilla?
No, it was just that he served so abominably, spilling the tea out of the pot.
I can imagine, spilling the tea.
I hope you didn't punish him.
Oh, no, I tried to cheer him up.
I gave him some more clothes to iron.
Thoughtful of you, Tish.
I'II get it.
Oscar!
How good to see you.
I just got in town and came right over to pick up Gorgo.
-Come in, come in.
-Thank you.
Gorgo, your master is here.
-He's ironing clothes?
-He Iearnt it all by himself.
Show him how well you do it, Gorgo.
Gorgo, the killer gorilla, a Iaundress!
I'm ruined, I'm ruined.
Not while there's an Addams on the scene.
There must be a solution.
Eureka!
And now, Iadies and gentlemen, I bring you the great attraction that you have all been waiting to see, the attraction that has brought thousands of people to my circus this week.
Gorgo, the world's most domesticated gorilla.
Darling, did I tell you I spoke to Mrs. Magruder?
-She saw Gorgo at the carnival.
-And all is forgiven?
She apologized for being so hasty when she realized we were training him for a friend.
Gorgo.
Guess he was won over by his association with a typical American family.
Darling, you're so right.
However, the next time I serve tea to Mrs. Magruder, I'm going to do it in the usual way.
Never spills a drop.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -The mail's in.
-Never mind, Lurch, I'II get it.
My new carving knife.
Nice knife.
Can I play autopsy with it?
Well, darling, autopsy's a fine game.
But this is for carving works of art.
Well, either I've got tough hair or this knife needs sharpening.
There, darling, I think it's sharp enough now.
Lovely, Morticia.
querida mia.
-Hurry up, Gomez.
-Are you getting tired, Uncle Fester?
No, I Iike to pose.
It's so artistic.
-Good.
I want to get the inner you.
-Not with that.
-Well, that's just for carving.
-That's what I'm afraid of.
Not for carving you, for carving your Iikeness.
Now, Iet's see a Iittle more of the Addams character.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Yes.
Now, a Iittle more to the right.
More.
Keep going.
Excellent.
Are you sure you're getting enough of my personality?
Try it in reverse.
Back up a Iittle.
Keep going.
Perfect.
Yes, but are you sure you're getting the real me?
You're right.
Let's have the real, the true, the unadorned you.
Beautiful.
And now for immortality.
Don't move, don't Iook, don't even breathe.
-Don't worry, I'II -Don't!
That's it.
Hold it.
By Jove, I think I've done it.
Why, Gomez, you're the Michelangelo of Halloween pumpkins.
How do you Iike it so far?
Darling, you have the soul of an artist and the touch of a surgeon.
Halloween always inspires me.
Are you Iooking forward to the guests who might come in tonight for trick-or-treat?
Oh, yes.
And the children are so excited about going out.
Good.
-I'd better see to the punch and cookies.
-AIways the perfect hostess.
Give us the smile.
-Lurch, I see you have the bowl ready.
-Yes, Mrs. Addams.
I think I'II start the punch and Iet it mellow for a while.
-You may fix the sandwiches, Lurch.
-Very good, Mrs. Addams.
Divine.
Thank you, Thing.
Gomez!
-Morticia!
-Yes?
Wednesday and Pugsley are all dressed up for trick-or-treat.
Well, bring them down, bring them down.
-Hear the siren?
-That's a police siren.
Great, the tank's dry as a bone.
Listen, next time we pull a stickup will you get gas?
AII right, all right, I forgot.
Yeah, and you dropped your gun in the getaway.
Boy, this sure ain't your night.
Come on, Iet's get out of here before the cops spot us.
And I'II take the Ioot.
I don't want you to forget it.
I know, you're always mad, Marty.
Hey, the whole area's heating up.
We've gotta take cover someplace.
-In there, quiet, behind that tree.
-Okay.
Hey, hey.
I could've sworn that gate was closed.
Man, you're beginning to give me the creeps.
Come on.
What's the idea?
Why'd you slam it so hard?
I was gonna ask you the same thing.
-How do we Iook?
-Mama, these are far too I agree, Gomez, they're much too startling.
They'II scare the wits out of people.
Yes.
When you knock on neighbors' doors, you'd better say, "Do not be alarmed.
We are only Iittle children".
Can we go now?
As soon as your father finishes the jack-o'-Iantern.
How do you Iike it?
Think it Iooks Iike Uncle Fester?
Better!
Good eye.
A true Addams.
This joint gives me the willies.
Will you get off it?
It's probably the house of some sweet Iittle old Iady.
Now, children, are we ready for trick-or-treat?
-We're ready, Father.
-Yeah, Iet's go.
Fine.
Now, these are to hold all the goodies you'II get.
I've got mine.
AII right, Mama, we'II escort our Iittle goblins on their Halloween rounds.
-There's somebody coming, Marty.
-Yeah, I hear.
-Will you put the mask away?
-I don't want them to recognize us.
Look, Father, we have visitors.
- That man has a mask.
-They must be trick-or-treating.
-Yes, yes, of course.
-Don't come any closer.
Mama, you must be right.
Better make your speech, children.
-Do not be alarmed.
-Do not be alarmed.
-We are only Iittle children.
-We are only Iittle children.
We're on our way to play trick-or-treat, too.
Yeah, we're out for Halloween, too.
A perfect night for Halloween.
You must come in and celebrate with us.
Sorry, we got other plans.
On second thought, we'II take you up on that offer.
Splendid.
Mama, I'II Ieave the children in your capable hands.
Don't keep them out too Iate.
-Just Iong enough to fill up our bags.
-Goodbye, Father.
Morticia, our first guests have arrived.
This is my wife.
Morticia, this is How ridiculous!
I forgot to ask your names.
Look, Mac, if you're thinking you're going to be I'm Marty and he's CIaude.
Welcome to our home.
Hey, that's quite an outfit you got on, Iady.
Thank you.
I always wear this one for Halloween.
Looks real good for Halloween.
We always try to get our home in the Halloween mood, too.
Yeah, you sure do.
I heard voices, Gomez.
Who is it?
Do we have guests?
Indeed we have, Uncle Fester.
This is Marty and CIaude.
PIeased to meet you.
You You folks sure don't hold back on Halloween.
It's our favorite holiday.
And this is our butler, Lurch.
-Pal, you top 'em all.
-Yes, Lurch is tops.
Most efficient, too.
I forgot to Iight the pumpkin.
It Iooks just Iike me.
Excuse me.
Gentlemen, come over here and I'II give you a treat.
-Open your bag.
-Don't start getting cute, mister.
Now, now, there's nothing to be ashamed of.
I think it's rather heartwarming that adults get in the Halloween spirit.
-Yeah, but just the same, I ain't -I told you he was efficient.
-Excuse me, Lurch.
-Why, you dirty Take it easy, Marty.
Let's see what happens.
It's full of money.
Okay, pal, you had your Iook.
Now just hand it over.
Morticia, our neighbors have given these gentlemen hundreds of dollars in trick-or-treat.
Makes one proud to Iive in such a neighborhood.
And I was going to give you apples.
My apologies, gentlemen.
There, that's better.
Happy Halloween.
-Would you excuse us a minute?
-Of course.
Go right ahead, gentlemen.
-Did you see what I saw?
-Yeah, a drawer full of Ioot.
Yeah, and the mask the big guy's got on.
We ought to wear something Iike that the next time we pull a job.
I'm gonna find out where he got it.
Friend, we've been admiring the mask.
Mind telling us where it come from?
It is mine.
Yeah, I know, but where did He's for real.
They're all for real.
Must you go?
We better, we better.
Just when things were beginning to perk up.
-Can't you stay a bit Ionger?
-Not this season, Iady.
Well, since you treated us so nice, I guess we'II stick around for a while.
Capital!
We'II celebrate in the old tradition.
-I'II see to the punch.
-I shall help you, my dear.
Fester, get the Halloween poems from the Iibrary.
Lurch, you get the tub ready for the bobbing game.
You gentlemen make yourselves at home.
The cops sounded Iike they were right outside.
Yeah, guess we better stay put for a while.
And as Iong as we gotta stay, we may as well make the most of it.
Okay.
I'm kind of hungry.
Not the food, stupid.
You saw that drawer full of money.
They probably got a Iot of jewelry, too.
We'II clean them out, and then we'II scram when the coast is clear.
I'm with you, pal.
I do think our guests are charming, don't you?
Yes, especially the one with the scar.
He reminds me of Rupert Styx.
He has the same beautiful, beady eyes.
I thought we'd agreed, Morticia, never to mention the name of Rupert Styx again.
-Gomez, darling, you're not still jealous?
-You were engaged to him.
Oh, well, I was just a silly young girl then.
I was fascinated by his Iong fingernails and the way his Iip curled when he smiled.
He was a handsome devil.
Morticia, please never mention his name again.
I promise, bubele.
querida mia.
When we're together, darling, every night is Halloween.
The punch is ready.
-It's Iocked.
We gotta get a key.
-We may have to rough 'em up a Iittle.
Yeah, well, that's my department.
You just watch.
It's a good thing one of us is all there tonight.
Hey.
Here they come.
We take 'em.
Okay, folks, this is a stickup.
I'm so sorry the children aren't here.
They'd be so amused.
Let's not rush the food.
The punch is ready but first Gomez will read us a Halloween poem.
-Here's the poem, Gomez.
-Thank you, Uncle Fester.
It's our favorite.
No Halloween would seem quite complete without it.
Won't you gentlemen please be seated?
-Poem?
We'd be better off in jail.
-Shut up!
I'II fix the Iights.
It'II put us in the proper mood.
Lurch!
To the harpsichord.
"It was Halloween evening and through the abode "Not a creature was stirring, not even a toad "Jack-o'-Ianterns are hung on the gallows with care  "To guide sister witch as she flies through the air" Drawn by eight beautiful bats.
"And she calls out to them "Come FIitter, come FIutter Come FIapper and FIyer "Come Chitter, come Chatter, Come Vicious Vampire" Excuse me.
Is something wrong?
Good heavens!
What in the world brought that on?
It's obvious.
They just don't Iike poetry.
Gentlemen, I'm so glad you decided to stay.
You are staying, aren't you?
-If you say so.
-We Iike you folks.
Wonderful.
Now we'II have some real fun.
Yes, we're going to play an old-fashioned Halloween game.
-Game?
-Yes, a bobbing game.
PIease, if you don't mind, we'II just sit here quiet for a while -and then scram.
-No, you must play.
-Okay, okay, if you say so.
-Sure.
We used to play the game.
Marty, you remember.
Yeah, that's where everybody kneels around a tub and bobs for the apples.
-Apples?
Apples?
-Well, what do you bob for?
Look, Marty.
We call it "Bobbing for the crab".
A real challenge.
-Yeah, but that crab's alive.
-And full of snap, too.
That's the challenge.
- Great sport.
-I'II go first.
Uncle Fester, no.
-That honor belongs to our guests.
-Oh, no, no.
You go ahead, pal.
-No, I was rude.
-We Iike rudeness.
PIease, we insist.
-After you, CIaude.
-No, be my guest.
I'II get it.
It's probably some more trick-or-treaters.
Darling, ask them in.
I just Iove Halloween.
Well, now, those are interesting costumes.
These are not costumes.
We're police officers.
Well, come in.
Just checking the neighborhood.
Everything all right here?
Yes, fine.
We're just getting into the Halloween spirit.
Care to join us?
-No, thanks, we're on a manhunt.
-Nice night for it.
-You won, you won.
-Both won.
Ole, ole.
PIease get it off.
Get it off!
Isn't that absolutely amazing?
Would you Iike to try it again?
-Try it again?
I'd rather wrestle a Iion.
-Would you?
Wonderful.
Kitty?
Here Kitty, Kitty.
-No!
-No!
Poor Kitty.
Just terrified of people.
Well, it's my turn now.
Cops or no cops, we'd better blow before we get killed.
But it bugs me to Ieave all that Ioot in the drawer.
They wanna play games, we'II play 'em a game.
A game that'II get us the Ioot.
-Look, money isn't everything.
-It's enough.
Hey, folks.
CIaude and I got a game we wanna play.
It's called hide-and-seek.
Hide-and-seek?
Sounds rather mild compared to bobbing for crabs.
-It'II fool you.
-Goody.
Let's try it.
I'm not having much Iuck down here.
Well, Claude and I'll be "it," see, and everybody else scrams and hides.
-Then what happens?
-We find you.
-Yes?
-Then we hide.
And you find us.
-Yes?
-That's it.
Excuse us for a moment.
My dear, I think we made a terrible mistake inviting those two men in.
-You do?
-Hide-and-seek?
Well, I'II admit it is a bit eccentric.
And they are rather strange.
But, after all, they're guests in our home.
You're right.
Addams hospitality.
-You're ready?
-Ready.
Okay, now everybody hides and we'II count to ten.
Pal, we're ready.
Goody.
I Iove games.
You, too.
Okay, here we go.
One, two, three, four, five, six Knock it off.
Get the drawer open.
-Hurry up!
-Okay, okay.
Oh, boy.
I can't wait to get out that door.
-Okay.
Come on.
-Okay.
This Ioot will pay us back for all the trouble we went through.
-It's Iocked!
-Now what?
Break the window.
-Did you -Let's get out of here!
-They're not seeking very hard.
-Strange game.
-They must want us to win.
-Very sporting.
Now, two of them went in there and the big guy's back there.
This way.
Let's go.
What's the matter with them?
Well, they ask us to hide and then they just run off.
Couple of oddballs.
They'II be all right.
Look.
Those nice policemen are helping them into their squad car.
Probably going to give them a Iift home.
Darling, did you pay your dues to the Zen-Yogi society?
My dear, I'm a paid-up member.
This is their Iatest position.
-Are you comfortable?
-Don't I Iook it?
Of course.
Is there anything new in the paper tonight?
Nothing much.
A revolution in South America, a war in Asia, a flood Oh, here's something.
It says our friends, Marty and CIaude, were sent up the river.
Good.
They needed a vacation.

Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -GOM  Caught in the act.
-Gomez, darling, you startled me.
What a thing for a husband to see.
On the day when an old suitor is coming to visit, he finds his wife striving to make herself even more beautiful.
Darling, Lionel Barker was not an old suitor.
He's just a childhood friend.
Yet when you got his Ietter, your eyes Iit up Iike candles in a cave.
You need be jealous of no one.
I've been yours since that first day you carved my initials in your Ieg.
And I have been yours since the day I first saw you riding sidesaddle on a buffalo.
querido.
querida.
Then you don't mind that I plan to ask Lionel to be our houseguest?
Not at all.
I want him to see what a Iovely home we have.
Would you Iike to see what I've done with the guest room?
Delighted.
Though it may give me a twinge.
-Charming, absolutely charming.
-I knew you'd be pleased.
How did you ever think of all these homey Iittle touches?
Just a knack.
Will you Iook at that?
-This mattress, it's harder than ours.
-No mattress, silly.
-Natural wood.
Knotty pine.
-Superb.
Do you really think Lionel will Iike it?
If he's a man of taste, and I'm sure he is.
Look, Lionel, you think it's worth it?
Going into that creep joint, I mean.
As I remember this Morticia dame, she's even spookier than this house.
I know they got dough, Iots of it, and we need some now.
What're you gonna give them?
That uranium stock spiel?
I have a feeling they're more the phony oil stock type.
Now, wait here and keep your fingers crossed, Charlie.
-Yes?
-I Mrs. Addams is expecting me.
I'm Lionel Barker.
Follow me.
-You're the butler?
-Lurch, sir.
Lurch.
Pardon me.
-Lionel?
-Morticia!
-Lionel, how good to see you.
-You haven't changed a bit.
-Except that she's married now.
-This is my husband, Gomez Addams.
-Lionel Barker.
-You certainly married a wonderful girl, Mr. Addams.
Yes, a man so seldom gets the wife he deserves.
Yeah, yeah.
It's quite a place you have here.
As Iong as you're in town, it's your home.
-Oh, no, really, I couldn't.
-We insist.
We'll send for your bags.
They're right outside.
I happened to bring them with me.
How fortunate.
Darling.
You rang?
Lurch, Mr. Barker's bags are outside.
PIease take them to the guest room.
Perhaps our Mr. Barker would Iike to join us in a cup of tea.
That would be marvelous.
And we can chat about those glorious, gloomy days of our youth.
-Those were the fun days.
-Yes.
Do you remember the first time we met?
I was in the garden, playing with Hubert and Henery.
And you strolled by, and I asked you in.
And I said I'd come in if you got rid of Hubert and Henery.
I never understood why.
-They were such adorable vultures.
-Just not my type, I guess.
Darling, I'm afraid we're Ieaving you out of the conversation.
You know how it is when old friends get together.
Excuse me, I have an urgent call to make.
Must you, dear?
We'll miss you.
Mr. Barker will be able to amuse you while I'm gone.
-Hope I didn't upset him.
-Gomez?
Dear Gomez.
There's not a jealous bone in his body.
"You know how it is when old friends get together".
Wonderful, wonderful.
Says we're gonna have a big storm tomorrow.
Uncle Fester, I'm baring my soul to you, and you just stand there casually reading your newspaper, and Iast year's.
I've been trying to catch up on my reading.
This is the first quiet moment I've spent in this thing in days.
Mama practically Iives in it.
You know something?
She's getting selfish in her old age.
Fester, what am I going to do about Lionel?
Who's Lionel?
Lionel?
I really had a case on you in those days.
Even wrote a poem about you.
Yes, a very romantic one, if I remember correctly.
I've kept it with all my other treasures, down in the basement.
-Pretty silly stuff, really.
-I don't think so at all.
How did it go again?
"Morticia, you are the only one for me.
"I know I shall always want you for my very own".
Can it be true, Uncle Fester?
Can she actually be smitten with this Lionel?
-Who's Lionel?
-Fester.
Oh, that Lionel.
Must be.
Just going off riding with him.
I engineered that so we could talk.
Well, still, forgetting to feed her plants.
Poor things, they're nearly starved.
They won't even Iet me feed them.
A hideous how do you do.
-Why don't you throw him out?
-I couldn't.
She would have thought that I was jealous.
-Are you?
-Of course.
It's gnawing at my insides, Iike a tiger gnawing at an antelope.
I wish it would stop.
I'm beginning to enjoy it.
Well, you gotta get rid of him somehow.
I have a plan.
We'll make it so uncomfortable for him that he'll want to Ieave.
-I'll need your help.
-You can count on me.
-First, we rearrange his room.
-Brilliant!
Well, no use Ietting this go to waste.
Why doesn't she cook this for us?
It's horrible, Gomez.
Just horrible.
-Yes, we've done a magnificent job.
-It's more than any man could stand.
Lionel is going to run screaming into the night.
Feel this mattress.
Eugh.
Listen to this.
Just Iisten to that awful bird.
I can't stand it.
Let's get out of here.
I can't wait till tomorrow morning at breakfast, just Morticia and me.
No Lionel.
That's the best breakfast I've had in days.
Gomez, darling, you haven't touched yours.
-I've Iost my appetite.
-I must say, you folks are wonderful hosts.
That room.
That beautiful, soft, downy bed.
And that gorgeous canary singing me to sleep.
And those carnations.
In your room?
-You really Iiked them?
-Loved them.
Well, I must call my business associate.
Excuse me.
By the way, I dabble in stocks and I might be able to put you onto something good.
We'll discuss it a Iittle Iater, okay?
Gomez, I don't see how you could have done such a terrible thing to our guest.
-Yes, I do.
You're jealous.
-Me?
Jealous?
That's Iaughable.
No, no, Charlie.
I'm not stalling.
I gotta give the guy the buildup.
Just sit tight and pretty soon we'll split a bundle.
Yeah, bye-bye.
You know, when I'm through here, Gomez, you ought to stretch out for a while.
-Wonderful picker-upper.
-I don't have time.
We must concoct another scheme to break up this romance.
I have it.
A diversionary tactic.
Another woman.
Oh, that's good.
You mean to come between him and Morticia, huh?
Right.
A seductive creature with an irresistible allure.
Now, where can we find one?
How about Grandmama?
You know, the merry widow.
No, Grandmama prefers taller men.
But she is the type we want.
Maybe we could get my old sweetheart, Queenie.
No, she'd never Ieave the circus.
Those bearded Iadies make a fortune.
If only he hadn't seen Lurch.
You know, he'd be ideal in a wig and a dress.
If only Lurch were a maid instead of a butler.
That's it.
A maid.
I'll hire a maid from an employment agency.
I'll insist on one who is interested in getting married.
Good.
Right this way, Miss What is your name?
Mildred, sir.
-Gee, this place is sort of spooky.
-Thank you.
-Now, about your duties -Oh, no.
I'm not staying.
-I think I can change your mind, miss.
-You don't have that much money.
But I do have a houseguest.
A dashing young bachelor who would find you most attractive.
A man, sir?
The kind who needs a wife.
In fact, he is seeking one desperately, and it could be you.
Well, this isn't such a bad place after all.
Your room is right in there.
Well, Uncle Fester, it Iooks Iike we have a winner.
A knockout.
Those tiny eyes shining through her glasses.
And did you notice the way her knees knock together?
Uncle Fester, at your age.
I've still got an eye for beauty.
By tomorrow, Lionel will be her slave.
-Is there anything I could bring you, sir?
-No, no.
-Tea or coffee?
Milk?
Vegetable juice?
-No, no, no and no.
What's the matter with you, anyway?
You followed me all over the place Iast night.
When I turned in, I Iooked under the bed to make sure you weren't there.
-Now there you go again.
-She's not making much progress.
Too shy.
I'll Iight it for you, sir.
That does it.
This girl needs instruction in the art of Iove from an expert.
You?
In my younger days, I had women eating out of my hand.
A bit messy, wasn't it?
You're simply too timid.
You've got to move in on him.
-You mean chase him?
-I mean catch him.
Grab him in your arms, Iike this.
And pour out your heart.
No Ionger can I hide my feelings, my Iove.
Give me your Iips.
There, have you got it now?
Where is Lionel?
Which way did he go?
Never mind.
I'll find him.
Thank you, Thing.
I'm sorry to make a spectacle of myself, Thing.
But my world has come down around my ears.
There's another woman.
No, it's true, there is.
I know you can be blase about it.
You've never been married.
Or have you?
I thought not.
Thing, what am I gonna do?
No, no.
No violence.
Not even hair-pulling.
Nor eye-scratching.
Thank you, anyway, Thing.
Thing?
Wish me Iuck.
Thank you, Thing.
You're a true friend.
I didn't know you were out here, Morticia.
Uncle Fester, I know why Gomez brought that woman into this house.
Oh, you do, huh?
Well, so do I, and I think it's a fine idea.
A fine idea?
No, no.
CIeopatra, no.
I will not condone violence.
Down, girl.
I think I'll go upstairs to my room and Iie down for a while.
I'm going up the back stairs.
You see?
Everything worked out fine, smarty.
You hit me in the nose.
Well, well, well.
Checking your stocks, I see.
How're they going?
Up, naturally.
You know, you folks have been wonderful to me, Gomez.
In fact, I'm very fond of the whole family.
-Especially Morticia, hmm?
-I've always had a warm spot for her.
What I started to say was, I'm going to do you a big favor.
You see, a pal of mine is the president of the South Tasmanian Oil Corporation If your pal put your money into South Tasmanian Oil, you ought to have him boiled in it.
The market is bullish today, Lionel.
I mean, Mr. Barker.
Bullish?
You mean, you really dig this jazz?
Well, I've always put my money into stocks.
Let's not talk about stocks, Mildred.
Let's talk about you.
-Me?
-Come.
Let me gaze into your big, beautiful, blue chip Eyes.
Is something wrong?
Tell me.
I think you know what's darkened our Iives.
Yes, I fear I do.
The hands that should caress my Ioving feet now caress the dragon.
But who are you caressing in your mind?
Not me.
Gomez, please Ieave me.
I can't talk now.
I must think.
Very well.
If that's what you want, I'll go.
I, too, must think.
There is no Ionger any doubt about it.
She's in Iove with Lionel.
-Well, what are you going to do?
-The only decent thing I can do.
Leave this Iife, and Iet Morticia marry the man she Ioves.
-You mean you're going to kill yourself?
-Of course not.
Suicide is the coward's way out.
I'm going to Iet you kill me.
Me?
You're my favorite nephew, Gomez.
You've been nice to me.
I Iike you.
AII I ask is one small favor.
Shoot me.
Well, if I refuse, I'd be an ingrate.
-AII right, stand over by the wall.
-Thank you, Uncle Fester.
You're a true friend.
Ready.
Aim.
Fire.
I would Iike to be shot, Uncle Fester, not drowned.
I'm sorry, this must be one of the children's guns.
-But I'll do better next time.
-You must.
It's the only bullet we have.
Now, close your eyes.
Lurch, I hope you're a better hangman than Uncle Fester was a marksman.
It's my rope, isn't it, Gomez?
I furnished the rope.
That's a bit scratchy.
Better, sir?
That's fine.
Thank you, Lurch.
Very comfortable.
Would you throw the other end of the rope up over the rafter?
No, no, wait a minute.
It's my rope.
I can AII I have to do is just throw it up over this rafter Iike this.
What's the matter with that thing?
Uncle Fester, do you recall where you got that rope years ago?
Sure, don't you remember?
I got it from an old friend of mine, Raj Maja, the Indian fakir.
Yeah, he used to throw it up in the air, then he'd climb Still works, doesn't it?
It's no use, Lurch.
Apparently, I am doomed to Iive.
Sorry, sir.
You rang?
Gad, she's Iovely.
How could I Iive without her?
Yet I must.
-Morticia, I must speak to you.
-And I to you.
Gomez, we've had a Iong and happy marriage.
Yes, we have, indeed.
Our Iife together has been filled with joy.
Until now.
I've heard of other marriages, where someone new has come along And Iove grew cold.
And husband and wife have come to the parting of the ways.
We have come to the parting of the ways, Gomez.
Our hour has struck.
We've gotta do something, Lurch.
Soothing music?
To the harpsichord.
-What will be, will be.
I have no regrets.
-Nor do I. -AII I want is your happiness.
-My only wish is to make you happy.
Now that you're in Iove with someone else, I'll step aside.
Though my heart is breaking, I'll freely give you up, -so you can go away with Mildred.
-So you can go away with Lionel.
-Mildred?
-Lionel?
Somebody call us?
I don't want Mildred.
-I thought you were in Iove -With Lionel?
Me?
-querido.
-querida.
We just dropped in to give you the good news.
We're off on our honeymoon.
-Honeymoon?
-You're married?
About an hour ago.
At City Hall.
-Congratulations.
-That's wonderful.
Well, Iet's go, baby.
-Gomez, I'm so happy for them.
-I'm even happier for us.
If I wasn't such a rotten shot, you wouldn't be here, would you?
What's this?
I nearly did an impulsive thing, my dear.
But my guardian spirit was Iooking after me.
-Somebody down there Iikes me.
-Somebody up here Iikes you, too, bubele.
There.
"When the blazing sun has turned to mud "and the moon Iies dead in a pool of blood, "and the tom-tom beat of eternity starts, "whom will I Iove in my heart of hearts?
"Morticia".
Gomez, that's beautiful.
And it's such a perfect night for poetry.
I just wanted to show you that Lionel's not the only one who can write poetry for you.
Oh, Lionel.
He couldn't hold a candle to you.
Perhaps we should Iet him try it sometime.
Might be a fascinating experience.
-No, he'll be too busy for that.
-Oh?
Working night and day, poor chap.
Those stocks his wife owns, down to nothing.
Really?
Well, things Iike that don't matter, not when you marry for Iove.
{END OF EPISODE 08}{START OF EPISODE 09}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat, Sweet, Petite, So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Now, now, CIeopatra, chew your burgers.
Don't gulp them.
Darling, now you see what happens when you gulp?
Quite enough Iunch.
Well, what do they Iook Iike?
Oh, just ordinary moving men.
One's tall, one's medium.
No, darling.
I mean, the new neighbors.
Oh, I haven't seen them yet.
They have some interesting things, though.
Really?
There's an item you could do things with.
Oh, I do hope they're imaginative.
The real estate man said they were newlyweds.
At Ieast they're romantic.
Really?
How nice.
I know just how they feel.
The joy of moving into a new house.
I'II never forget my first night in this Iovely house.
-We thought it was haunted.
-Well, you can't have everything.
I only hope they'II be half as happy.
How could they be anything else?
With us right next door.
Horrible house next door.
You suppose anybody Iives in it?
Honey, I didn't even know that house was there.
As I remember it, the renting agent had the shutters closed on this side.
Married by a Justice of the Peace, and no honeymoon and now I spend my wedding night in this house.
Well, it could have been worse.
You might have had to spend it in that house.
What was that?
It was an explosion from that monstrosity.
I'II go over there and see what's happening.
I'II go with you.
In sickness and in health, for better, for worse, we're stuck in this thing together.
There we are now, down you go.
Mmm-hmm.
Huh?
-There we are.
You see them yet?
-No.
Maybe they'II see us and come over.
I still think we should just have gone over and introduced ourselves.
Oh, darling, no.
That's much too forward.
This is better.
Here they come.
Mmm.
Oh, how do you do?
I'm Gomez Addams.
This is my wife, Morticia.
How do you do?
Hubert Peterson.
This is my wife, Amanda.
-We were just married.
-Oh, how exciting!
You do that again Never mind the small talk.
Find out what blew up.
Oh, yes.
We were just wondering about those Iittle explosions.
What explosions?
Those explosions.
Oh, that must be Uncle Fester playing with his new dynamite caps.
What?
He got them at the discount house.
They are not up to par.
You mean there's somebody exploding dynamite inside your house?
Where else would he do it?
Well, I see you're washing your pup.
Oh, good heavens.
That isn't a pup.
It's an octopus.
-You have an octopus for a pet?
-Oh, no.
It's our son's pet.
-Go ahead, shake his tentacle.
-Take it away.
-Darling, dry it first.
-Oh, I'm sorry.
Excuse me.
-There we are.
-He's really very friendly.
Let's get out of here.
-Yes, well, nice meeting you both.
-Nice meeting you.
Seems Iike a nice chap.
-She's a bit odd.
-Little high-strung.
It's their wedding day, a new house.
And, Aristotle, you were very, very bashful.
Time to dry.
I had so hoped she'd be someone I could exchange recipes with.
Hubert, you never should have rented this house without Ietting me see it.
Honey, remember the fantastic deal we got.
Well, I guess I'II just have to pretend they're not there.
That's my dear, brave girl.
-What was that?
-What was what?
You know what.
Those sounds under the house.
-Termites?
-I knew it.
The house is crumbling.
It came from over there.
Howdy.
I'm Uncle Fester, from next door.
Gosh, Hubert, he's that dynamite nut.
He'II blow us up.
I just came over to say hello.
Nail that shut.
Goodbye, Hubert.
I'II call you.
-Where are you going?
-Out.
-Oh, but, honey, this is our wedding day.
-Enjoy it.
But, honey Oh, Mr. Wentworth, thank goodness you're here.
And here's your Iease, all signed and sealed.
For a year, this happy honeymoon cottage is all yours.
Hubert, either get me another house or get yourself another wife.
Now, calm down, honey, calm down.
Perhaps Mr. Wentworth will cancel the Iease?
Oh, I'm only the rental agent.
Well, where do I find the owner?
Right next door.
His name is Addams.
-What'd they hit you with, Fester?
-I don't know.
I just opened up the trap door and said, "Howdy," and wham!
Don't sound very friendly to me.
You must have frightened them going through Pugsley's tunnel.
Next time, Uncle Fester, knock.
-I did.
-Really?
Gomez, we have ourselves some very peculiar neighbors.
Peculiar?
They're a couple of nuts.
There's only one thing to do.
Get rid of them.
I can't.
I signed the Iease this morning.
I'II get rid of them.
-I'II go with you, Fester.
-Right, Mama.
I haven't used this beauty since the taxman was here.
-Fester, Mama, control yourselves.
-Yes, think of what you're doing.
You know, they're right.
We better not go over there in broad daylight.
-They're Iiable to ambush us.
-We'II wait till it's dark.
You will do no such thing.
They're our neighbors.
Excuse me, my dears.
Probably them, coming over to apologize.
We'd better go out in the backyard and practice, anyway.
Just in case.
Mr. Wentworth, how nice to see you again.
And it's always such a Such a thrill to see you, Mrs. Addams.
-My!
That's a new dress you're wearing.
-How kind of you to notice.
GIad you dropped in, Wentworth.
Those new tenants, have they signed the Iease yet?
They want to break it.
Leave that Iovely cottage?
With its view of this fine old mansion?
-Well, they're young, rattlebrained.
-They did seem a bit nervous.
But it's their wedding day.
-I shook, too, remember?
-Yes.
Anyway, the Iease is signed, and they'II just have to Iearn to Iive with you.
It.
We'II try to make them as happy as possible.
Ah, you're real people.
Well, goodbye, Mr. Addams.
-Wentworth.
-Mrs. Addams.
Those poor Petersons.
What can we do for them?
I think I know what their trouble is.
They are Ionely.
You may be right.
Oh, Gomez, we've been very selfish.
After all, they're newlyweds.
I should have been over there a Iong time ago.
With a pot of henbane soup, some of my dwarf's hair cobbler and marital advice.
-Let's go over right now.
-No, darling, I have a better idea.
Let's invite them over tonight for a game of bridge.
You think they'II wanna play bridge on their wedding night?
Of course, it'II relax them.
You rang?
Lurch, go over to the Petersons' and invite them over for bridge tonight.
And, Lurch, use the front door, not Pugsley's tunnel.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
-I hope they're sharp players.
-Oh, so do I. We haven't had any real competition since the Thompsons were taken away.
You think they'II come?
Oh, I'm sure they will.
Lurch is very persuasive.
You see?
They've accepted.
I do hope everything goes well tonight.
How can it fail, my dear?
-You're such a perfect hostess.
-Darling.
And if the bridge gets dull, you can do your animal imitations.
Do them now, Tish.
-Oh, darling.
-PIease.
Very well.
Now the bullfrog, Tish.
That bullfrog, it drives me wild.
Let's not play cards tonight, Tish.
I feel Iike honeymooning myself tonight.
Darling, you're so impetuous.
Bridge first, bullfrog Iater.
Isn't it a Iittle Iate for Uncle Fester to be playing with his dynamite caps?
It's not dynamite, that was a gunshot.
Came from the playroom.
Better not miss, Fester.
Morticia hates bullet holes in her wall.
Don't worry.
I'm aiming way down Iow at the pigeon's feet.
What's going on down here?
Well, if you insist on inviting those barbarians from next door over for bridge, I just want to be prepared.
Fester's very handy with that gun.
He shot a pigeon right through the eye.
It wasn't even the one I was aiming at.
Oh, Uncle Fester, I'm sure we're not going to have any trouble with that nice young couple.
Oh, no?
Well, this Iittle beauty mark wasn't caused by a mosquito bite, you know.
AII this fuss over a bump on the head.
I think it's rather attractive.
That's true, Fester.
I guess anything's an improvement.
Mama will serve the refreshments.
I'II serve it to them, right over their heads.
You?
The soul of graciousness and charm?
Well, that's true.
Couldn't I just spill some coffee in their Iaps?
Not a drop.
Well, how about a Iittle cream down their backs?
Remember, you're an Addams.
Oh, you're right, dear.
AII this hostile talk, and those two poor dears are sitting over there just dying to be friendly.
-No, no, no!
I'm not going over there!
-Look, we've got to go.
Do you expect me to be nice to those spooks?
Oh, please honey.
If we break the Iease, he'II sue us.
But But if we butter them up, they may Iet us out of the Iease.
Now, come on.
-Must I?
-You must.
Well, Iove, honor is one thing, but why do they have to say obey?
Well, they should be along any minute now.
Oh, I do hope the new neighbors will Iike the house.
-Do you think they will?
-How can they help it?
-It is nice and dismal, isn't it?
-Don't be modest, my dear.
-It's absolutely bleak.
-Thank you, darling.
Oh, those roses want trimming.
Have you seen my shears, dear?
Why, thank you, Thing.
Thing, you need a manicure.
Look at that.
And I did so want you to Iook nice for the new neighbors.
Who knows?
They might introduce you to a nice girl, Thing.
Oh, come now.
Don't you ever Iong for something to hold hands with?
Woman hater.
Very well, Thing.
Find your own friends.
My dear, I don't think there's time to start clipping roses now.
Oh?
Well, perhaps you're right.
I know.
-Beautiful.
-Oh, yes.
You are so very clever.
Thank you, darling.
Uncle Fester, what are you doing there?
If those neighbors start getting rough-Iike, Genevieve will put them in their right place.
Uncle Fester, I will not stand for any bloodshed in my Iiving room.
Morticia's right, Uncle Fester.
That's a brand new rug in there.
However, never fear, my dear.
Uncle Fester's aim is terrible.
-He's been practicing.
-I don't need practice.
Even with my eyes shut, I always hit something.
You can relax, Morticia.
An Addams never starts trouble.
He just gets into it.
Hubie, please, I can't go in there.
Honey, our future's at stake.
Now, you've got to go along.
-Go along.
-And say nothing.
-Say nothing.
-Be pleasant.
-Be pleasant.
-And smile.
That's it, and no matter what happens, smile.
Oh, hello, hello!
Welcome, honeymooners.
Welcome, welcome.
Aren't they thoughtful, dear?
Throwing rice?
-That's not rice, old man.
-It's Iizards' teeth.
Lizards' teeth?
In the Amazon, no wedding ceremony is complete without the traditional shower of Iizards' teeth.
-Lovely.
-Lovely.
On to the bridge table.
My, what a beautiful room.
She agrees.
How sweet of you to say so.
-Is that -Amanda.
-What an unusual decoration.
-Do you Iike it?
Oh, we Iove it.
Seems to tell a story.
You're the first one to really appreciate it.
-It's yours.
-Oh, no!
We insist.
Oh, I see you've noticed another Iittle treasure.
-Isn't it cute, dear?
Two heads.
-Cute.
Well, you know what they always say, two heads are better than one.
Say no more.
Take it.
-I wouldn't have that thing -Amanda.
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.
I can see by your expression that you're fascinated by Pierre there.
Well, we'II throw him in for good measure, too.
-But, I -No buts.
Of course not.
After all, Pierre would only be Ionely with the turtle gone.
-You're so kind.
-Kind.
-Generous.
-Generous.
-Smile.
-Smile.
Don't misunderstand, Mr. Addams.
We Iike our house very much.
Then why do you want to move out?
The rent too high?
-Oh, no, no.
-Be glad to Iower it.
-What would you Iike to pay?
-Well, it's not that at all.
It's just that it's too far away from the supermarkets.
Oh, goodness.
You don't need any supermarkets.
I know a Iot of Iittle specialty shops.
Do you folks Iike fricassee of toad?
-Amanda.
-Love it.
Good.
I'II make you up a batch.
-What What -Oh, what a wonderful idea.
Five-handed bridge.
Dear Thing.
Loves to kibitz.
Thing, say hello to the Petersons.
Nice to meet you.
-Do you mind if I smoke?
-No, go right ahead.
Hubert!
I just don't understand their running out that way.
We couldn't have been friendlier.
Neither could Thing.
He has such a wonderful social instinct.
Tries to make everyone feel right at home.
Maybe it's because he was kibitzing.
That makes some bridge players terribly nervous.
Oh, I don't think so, dear.
Besides, the card he threw was absolutely right.
They certainly Iiked our home.
Gomez, was it impolite of me to smoke?
Querida mia, everyone smokes.
Gomez, do you think it's possible they could have been frightened by the shot?
-What shot?
-Uncle Fester's gun.
Oh, that.
Well, they were a bit jumpy.
Darling, of course they were jumpy.
It was their wedding day.
How could we have been so blind?
-That about right, my dear?
-Perfect, darling.
It all goes to prove how foolish superstition can be.
Here our young friends get married on Friday the 13th, and just Iook how beautifully everything turned out.
Well, Iooking a Iittle better, isn't it?
-It's the most gosh-awful -Smile, Hubert.
It's beautiful.
We knew when we saw you admiring our Iovely fish that you were people of taste.
Our kind of people.
Excuse me.
-Hubert, do you Iove me?
-Of course I Iove you.
Do you really Iove me?
Well, I wouldn't have married you if I didn't Iove you.
Then prove it.
Get those people and their awful things out of my house.
Honey, I can't.
We've gotta be nice to him to get out of the Iease.
I don't care about your silly Iease.
Either you get us out of this whole mess or I'm Ieaving.
I think I've got an idea.
-Well, whatever it is, try it.
-I will.
-Mr. Addams?
-Yes.
-I'd Iike to talk to you.
-Certainly.
Go right ahead.
Well, before you go to any more trouble, I think I ought to tell you the real reason we can't stay in this house.
Oh, what's that?
Well, I got a wire from my company, and I'm being transferred to Hong Kong.
Say no more.
I understand and I'II take care of it.
Would you?
After all, Peterson, what are neighbors for?
Oh, the dear Petersons.
I do hope they're feeling better today.
They're bound to, after I tell them the good news.
Oh, here they are.
Come in, come in.
I have capital news for you, old man.
-You mean we're free to move?
-Au contraire, you're free to stay.
-What?
-What?
I bought your company and you don't have to go to Hong Kong.
You can stay and be our neighbors forever.
Oh, the poor dears.
I guess the excitement was just too much for them.
Cigar, Thing?
I forgot.
You can't smoke.
Oh, boy!
Very clever play, Thing.
Darling, the oddest thing happened.
The Petersons Ieft all those Iovely things we gave them on our front Iawn.
Probably thought we were being too generous.
Perhaps.
Still, it's strange.
We haven't seen them in three days.
Darling, it's their honeymoon.
Oh, yes, of course.
I forgot.
They must be starved.
I think I'II take them over a nice casserole of yak, knock discreetly, then tiptoe away.
-What if they don't Iike yak?
-Not Iike yak?
Darling, you make them sound weird.
No, the king.
-What in the world brought that on?
-Probably resented your helping me.
After what he did at our bridge game?
Thing?
Open up.
Thing!
I do not Iike petulant things.
Now, was that nice?
Very well, that's better.
Your play, Thing.
Beats me every time.
Forget it, darling.
Forget the Petersons.
Do the bullfrog for me, Tish.
PIease.
PIease.
Very well.
It's our turn now.
They won't see us for three days.
Bubele,
{END OF EPISODE 09}{START OF EPISODE 10}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family -Lovely day, isn't it?
-Yes.
The chill goes right through you.
Look at them.
Oh, they have such good times together.
-Well, here we are.
-Is this the Addams house?
Yep.
Are you sure this is the place you wanna go to?
Why, yes.
Okay.
You know, it's not too Iate.
I could still take you back into town and turn you over to those Travelers Aid.
-No, thank you.
-Okay, Iady.
I wonder who that could be?
It may not be a who.
It may be a what.
You optimist.
A relative.
-Morticia?
It's me.
-Cousin Melancholia!
Oh, darling!
Gomez, you remember Melancholia.
Who could forget that face?
I know I should have called, but everything happened so fast.
-Everything?
-It's Fred.
-My intended.
-He jilted you.
Well, I can't really say.
He just took back his ring, sold his farm and joined the Foreign Legion.
That is kind of indefinite.
I just didn't know what to do.
I'm glad you came to us in your hour of trial.
And you remember Mama?
I always said that you'd grow up to be a beauty.
Oh, Mama, you haven't changed a bit.
And you haven't Iost a bit of your Iooks.
The vain old thing takes hours to get herself together.
It certainly shows.
Darling, why don't you go upstairs and freshen up and we'II talk it all over Iater.
Follow me.
Oh.
It's so good to be where you feel at home.
I'd better make her a nice hot cup of henbane juice.
Thank you, Mama.
Gomez, is there anything we can do to help Melancholia?
Well, if we can't help her, who can?
-We have to find her a man.
-But where?
Darling, you have so many vast business interests, you must know someone.
Well, Iet's see now.
There's old Charlie Carlisle the accountant.
-No, he's dead.
-He wouldn't be right.
Melancholia needs someone dashing, handsome, charming.
Like you, darling.
Carinito, you're really making it tough.
Now, now, now, CIeopatra, you're much too young to take tea.
Yes, indeed.
That's right.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, she'd make a perfect wife.
Yes, I see.
Uh-huh.
Well, then, it's obvious I have the wrong number.
-Any Iuck?
-Seven refusals.
Fortunately, three of them were wrong numbers.
We just have to keep trying.
What about Ed Franzen, the fellow who works at the monument company?
-Much too flighty.
-You're right.
Even when he's carving those inscriptions he can't stop giggling.
-Darling, have you tried your salt mine?
-No, by Jove!
They used to have a pretty Iively crowd down there.
I just know this is gonna work.
It's got to, I'm running out of companies.
Hello?
Sutton?
Addams here.
Say, we've got a ravishing young cousin here who's just dying for some company.
Oh, well, thanks anyway.
Keep the salt rolling.
-Nothing?
-Nothing.
But don't despair, we'II find someone.
-How about a marriage broker?
-Capital idea!
I know just the one.
Hasty Marriage.
The same one we got for Cousin Gripe.
Hasty Marriage?
How are you fixed for grooms?
Really?
He says they've got a complete selection.
How romantic.
Tell them to send over a few, and then Melancholia can take her pick.
How about sending over a few samples?
Oh, you know, one tall, one short, one fat, one thin.
Better make that two thins.
The name is Addams.
Hello?
Hello?
I think we were disconnected.
It's just as well.
I think we should get one of our own.
You're right, we should.
-Lurch.
-Oh, dear, not Lurch.
-He's such a playboy.
-That's all an act.
You'II see.
You rang?
Lurch, have you ever given thought to the blissful joys of marriage?
You see?
Underneath that devil-may-care, he's a sentimental softie.
Lurch, we have a Iovely girl for you.
Sweet, soft and soulful.
I thought you wanted him for Melancholia.
I'm talking about Melancholia.
Now, now, Lurch, control yourself.
You mustn't appear overanxious.
Now, about the wedding date.
-Obviously he prefers a Iong engagement.
-Nonsense.
Two people so ideally suited.
Why wait?
-How about eloping tonight?
-PIease.
Well, it is a bit hasty.
How about tomorrow night?
We'II all go together.
We'II make it a combination elopement and picnic.
Darling, somehow I don't think Lurch takes to the idea of an elopement.
AII right, forget the elopement, we'II just go on the picnic.
It's a Iovely idea!
But I do believe Melancholia would rather be married.
No.
By Jove, Morticia, I'm beginning to believe you were right.
He is a playboy.
Very well, Lurch, you may go.
But, remember, there will never be another Melancholia.
Never.
They would have made a Iovely couple.
I just Iove weddings.
They always make me cry.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
Thing?
Have you ever given thought to the blissful joys of marriage?
The Things of today.
Forget it.
I think Melancholia would prefer a professional man.
A doctor.
Or a Iawyer.
No, no, no.
Not me.
I will not go back to that Addams house, never.
But a deal Iike this.
Think of your wife and children.
-I have no wife and children.
-Then think of mine.
-This deal could mean millions.
-Not worth it.
Come on now, Harvey, you have to.
This is the chief reason I brought you back into the firm.
You're the only Iawyer in our office who's had any contact with them.
I would rather have contact with a nest of scorpions.
Oh, come on, now.
So the family is a Iittle eccentric.
The point is we have a job to do.
If it means going back to that house, I am not going to do it.
What am I asking you to do?
An important client wants something Addams has.
AII you have to do is go over there and discuss it with him.
Go on, make an appointment.
I knew I could depend on you.
Mr. Addams, please.
Oh, he's not home?
The whole family's gone on a world cruise?
The whole family's gone on a world cruise.
Try it now.
First I need a good stiff drink.
It's no use, I can't find a man anywhere.
Oh, poor Melancholia.
Doomed to spinsterhood.
Oh, Melancholia, darling, we were just talking about you.
-I know.
Nobody wants me.
-Oh, what nonsense.
No.
I'm cursed.
Fred isn't the first tragedy in my Iife.
I got as far as the altar with EImer.
-What happened?
-I got there but EImer didn't.
-He just ran off.
-Foreign Legion?
-South America.
-That is better climate.
Well, darling, it's obvious.
They felt unworthy.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Addams speaking.
Oh, hello, Mr. Harvey.
Just a moment.
Darling, it's that nice young Iawyer, Mr. Harvey.
He wants to talk to you.
Not now, this is all too disturbing.
Mr. Harvey, I'm afraid Mr. Addams can't come to the phone right now.
He's involved in a Iittle family problem.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'm sure an old bachelor Iike myself can't be of any help.
Bye.
It's no use.
He didn't even get on the phone.
Your problem is solved.
-Mama!
What in the world?
-Love dust.
Don't you remember?
Worked wonders for you and Gomez.
Oh, of course.
How thoughtful of you, Mama.
-It'II bring the men howling.
-Are you sure?
Well, we'd better use a double dose.
-There, that ought to do it.
-Thank you, Mama.
What's so funny?
-Gomez, she's crying.
-Oh.
Darling, don't you worry, we'II find you a man.
You may have to Iower your standards a bit.
Oh, I feel just awful bothering you two.
And interfering with your business.
-You probably offended that man.
-Oh, no, Mr. Harvey's very understanding, -even though he is a bachelor.
-Yes, he's a very -Bachelor!
-Bachelor!
Yes?
Oh, of course.
Mr. Addams.
-Look, I don't want to impose.
-Impose?
My dear fellow, to you the Addams home is Liberty Hall.
It's just a Iittle business matter.
-Excellent.
PIan to stay all evening.
-Thank you.
-Well, how does it Iook?
-Wonderful.
Mr. Harvey is a very suave, sophisticated man.
So Iet's get rid of these homey things, shall we?
You can wear anything of mine that you Iike.
Oh, they're gorgeous!
-Oh, Cousin Morticia, you're too generous.
-Darling, what's family for?
Now come along to the mirror.
I want to pluck your eyebrows.
When I finish with you you won't recognize yourself.
-Is Mr. Harvey a real good friend of yours?
-Oh, yes.
He's a Iittle bit shy and reserved.
I'm afraid you'II have to take him in hand.
In both hands.
Are you sure he'II come?
He's probably dying to come.
They're not home.
Well, some other time.
Harvey, old man!
-So good to see you again.
-Nice to be back.
-Lurch, a drink for our friend.
-Oh, thank you, I'm not thirsty.
Nonsense, it's something special.
The Vat '68.
Look, Mr. Addams, I don't wanna take up your time.
I know you're a very busy man.
But all we want is an option on an itty-bitty, worthless piece of African Iand you've got.
Worthless?
With all those fine subterranean bat caves?
Come, come, Harvey, you're not talking to a child.
Here we are.
Superb.
-Really, I don't want any of that.
-PIease, Harvey, I never drink alone.
Besides, you Iook as though you can use a drink.
You must've had a pretty hard day.
Oh, the day was all right.
It's the night.
-Well, drink up, there's plenty more.
-I'II bet.
It really hits the spot.
Harvey, you're not drinking.
Wait.
Now we have something to drink to.
To the Iadies.
Ever seen two Iovelier girls?
I know the one on the right is your wife.
But what is Who's the other one?
That's Mrs. Addams' cousin, Melancholia.
You Iike her?
-Oh, yes, she's Iovely.
-Good.
She's your date.
-Am I dead?
-Of course not, silly.
Oh, too bad.
-Where are the others?
-They thought we'd Iike to be alone.
I don't know about we, but I would.
-I've got to put something in my car.
-Something in your car?
-What?
-Me.
Out for a Iittle air, old man?
This has been a rather heady experience.
-You gave us quite a scare.
-I gave you a scare?
I thought I was gonna be a widow before I was a bride.
-I beg your pardon?
-Melancholia does that to a man.
But don't you worry about it.
You'II feel a Iot better when you get some food in your stomach.
Mama is cooking up a real surprise.
I am so hungry I could eat a wolf.
Gomez, you guessed it!
Superb dinner.
That belladonna sauce really brings out the flavor.
-You didn't eat much, Harvey.
-The excitement.
Love is that way.
I suddenly felt all chilled and goosebumpy, too.
Well, a Iittle bicarb and you'II be fine.
Would you two Iovebirds Iike to dance?
-No, thank you.
-Love to.
Only first I have to fix my face.
Now, if you'II just Iook over these contracts What was that?
Love dust.
Mama is an incurable romantic.
AII she ever thinks about is Iove, Iove, Iove.
Well, all I ever think about is business, business, business.
Excellent, a woman needs a good provider.
Especially Melancholia.
She's a bit extravagant, I'm afraid.
But she's so much in Iove she's about to burst.
Well, that would solve everything.
I mean, your cousin's a Iovely girl.
Too Iovely for just one man.
So why don't I call you tomorrow?
We can talk over the deal on the phone.
-You wanted something, sir?
-Just out.
Oh, nonsense, the evening is just getting underway.
-I'm back.
-You see?
Oh, Melly.
You Iight up the room.
I am sure you and Melancholia have Iots of things to talk about.
So why don't you just sit down?
But watch him, Melly darling, he's a charmer.
-He's one of our most dashing bachelors.
-Is that nice, Mr. Harvey?
When did you decide to become a bachelor?
Just tonight.
Now, about this deal My!
You're a jumpy one.
Mr. Addams, it seems they've discovered oil on your game preserve in Nairobi.
-Did you say oil?
-Oh, just a few drops.
Oh, Gomez, Mr. Harvey doesn't want to talk about any old oil.
But I do, I do!
Oh, I can't wait to hear him say that to a preacher.
-Now, if you'II just sign right here -I have to think about it, Harvey.
After all, I do owe something to the bats.
But we don't want all of it.
Just one teeny Iittle well.
Oh, Gomez, give it to him.
Nairobi's such a romantic place.
Those Iovely nights with the hyenas howling.
Makes a perfect spot for a honeymoon.
You're so right, Mrs. Addams, you really have a good business -Honeymoon?
Whose honeymoon?
-Why, yours and Melancholia's.
-Provided she accepts your proposal.
-I accept.
-Welcome to the family, old man.
-But No buts.
I'II take these into the Iibrary and Iook them over.
In the meantime, you two can go in the conservatory and make your plans.
We'II drink a toast to the bride and groom.
You rang?
Champagne for the newlyweds, Lurch.
Mr. Addams, maybe I better go with you and explain some of those clauses.
And Ieave your Iove-starved Iittle dream girl all alone?
-Nonsense.
-But Don't they make a handsome couple?
He's a man, she's a woman.
Perfect match.
Hard to believe we just met.
This whole evening has been pretty unbelievable.
-Don't you think it's fate?
-No.
Just my Iuck.
Oh, what a Iovely thing to say!
-Kiss me.
-Kiss you?
You don't want me to tell Gomez you're afraid, do you?
No, no, please, Iet's keep him out of this.
Well, then.
Kiss me.
I'II keep my eyes closed.
-Is it all right if I close mine, too?
-Of course, silly.
Oh, no!
You are a bashful boy.
Maybe this will cure you.
I just Iove weddings, don't you, darling?
Mmm-hmm.
-They're so romantic.
-Out of my way.
-AII right, where is she?
-Who are you?
Gomez Addams here.
Never mind that, where's Melancholia?
Fred.
I thought you'd joined the Foreign Legion.
Not the Foreign Legion, you rock-head.
The American Legion.
-But, dear, you took the ring back.
-I had to.
Your finger was turning green.
-I brought you a nice brass one.
-Oh, thank you!
Oh, Ralph, this is my fiance, Fred.
Fred, this is my fiance, Ralph.
You mean I'm gonna have to fight for you?
-Oh, no, no.
-Okay.
This is so romantic.
Come on.
Thanks for the hospitality.
Well!
Oh, Mr. Harvey?
Mr. Harvey.
Wake up.
Wake up, Mr. Harvey.
-Am I still alive?
-Very much.
And here are the signed papers.
You've got a deal.
Don't you worry about that ungrateful Melancholia.
I've got Iots of cousins.
I have to get this nice and clean for Pugsley.
-What is it?
A telescope?
-An African blowgun.
That reminds me.
Do you miss Melancholia?
No, indeed, my dear, I'm glad she's gone.
Ungrateful wench.
Now, now, remember blood is thicker than water.
Thank heaven.
She certainly wasn't the right girl for Harvey.
-He's a nice man, isn't he?
-Yes, indeed.
I ought to give him more of my Iegal business.
I think that's an excellent idea.
Why don't you call him?
I think I'II do that.
There.
It's all finished.
What do you think, darling?
Do you think Uncle Crimp will Iike his new sweater?
I hope so.
Looks Iike a perfect fit.
Mr. Harvey, please.
Oh, I see.
He's Ieft town.
-For Iong?
-I'm afraid so.
He's joined the Foreign Legion.

They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family How exciting.
Look at them go!
This is going to be the greatest train wreck in railroad history.
I'm gonna switch them onto the same track.
Watch!
Wonderful.
Darling, you have such a way with trains.
- I suppose so.
- Weren't you happy with it?
I thought it was your finest wreck.
Perhaps it was.
But I've just realized, if you wreck one train, you wreck them all.
Sometimes I almost wish they'd miss each other.
Gomez, what a shocking thought.
Maybe we've just gotten into a rut.
We do seem to be doing the same things over and over again.
- Our morning stroll through the swamp.
- Fencing across the lunch table.
Darling, why don't you come and have a nice hot cup of henbane?
It'll soothe your nerves.
Thank you, Thing.
- Darling.
- Thank you.
Darling, maybe we should take a trip somewhere.
Tombstone or Death Valley.
Some fun place.
Perhaps.
Good morning, darling.
Would you like a bite?
Chew your food.
No, no.
Cleopatra, you'll spoil your lunch.
Darling, maybe we should have some people in.
That nice Mr. Harris.
He always seemed to enjoy himself here.
That would be pleasant, but I'm afraid Mr. Harris won't have the time for us any longer.
Did you see the paper this morning?
No, darling, I haven't read the paper yet.
He has a new job working for the government.
"Foreign diplomats visiting our city.
Roger L. Harris to conduct tour for VIPs".
There's a picture.
They certainly seem to be enjoying the tour.
Well, I hope you'll enjoy the places we're going to see today, gentlemen.
We will not enjoy.
Frankly, Washington is quite upset about your lack of enthusiasm so far.
So?
They seem to blame me for it.
If I fail to give you a good impression of our country, well Oh, it'll mean the axe for me.
- Miri Haan, take note.
- Note I take.
If guide fails assignment, Washington masters will chop off head.
Naturally.
No, I don't mean they'll chop my head off.
I mean they'll fire me.
- And then set fire to him.
- Destroy evidence.
Gentlemen, look, you take our language too literally.
For two days now your Washington masters have shown us phony tour.
They only show us what they want us to see.
You do not show us the real America.
The downtrodden masses slaving under bureaucratic whip.
We want to see the people.
The real peoples!
Peoples.
All right.
All right, anything you say.
You can see anybody you want to.
Good.
We choose honest way.
By chance.
We stick pin into phone book.
Wherever pin strikes we go.
- All right with me.
- Miri Haan, phone book.
I'll get a pin.
- We use our own pin.
- Always.
Eeny, meeny, miney, boom!
What's the matter, Tish?
Something wrong?
That's strange.
I felt just as though I'd been stuck with a pin.
The Addams.
Oh, no, no, they aren't They're off limits.
Excuse me, sir.
Please don't go in there.
A-ha!
- Guide begs us not to go in.
Why?
- Why?
Because we have found real American family, not phony bureaucratic setup.
- That's not so.
- And government - will chop off his head for this.
- Poor fellow.
Come.
We go see some real Americans.
Look, fellows, I know where there's a dandy little bar downtown with beautiful dancing girls.
You'll have a ball there.
A-ha!
Miri, take note.
Guide tries to bribe us but we refuse.
We are strong men.
We go later.
Now we go see typical American family.
- Very interesting.
- I take note.
Mrs. Addams, you have a very interesting house here.
I have seen nothing like it before in America.
Well, it's nothing out of the ordinary, but we like it.
And I'm so glad you gentlemen could come.
You've brightened our day immensely.
Harris, it was very nice of you to bring them here.
- Well, it wasn't my idea - He was very eager for us to meet average American family, is not so, Mr. Harris?
I keep telling you!
The Addams are not an average family at all.
- How sweet.
- Don't be turning our heads with flattery.
I do wish I'd known you were coming.
I could've planned some sort of amusement.
Oh, no, please.
We wish to observe everyday routine.
Agreed?
Whatever you wish.
Psst.
Our house is your house, gentlemen.
Mr. Haan, may I offer you a cigar?
Here, have one.
I will save for later.
Let's join the conversation.
Psst.
Mr. Haan, sit down.
- Miri Haan, you're smoking.
- Oh, no, I save for later.
Mr. Haan, I'm terribly sorry.
I should've warned you it was a live cigar.
I begged you not to come here in the first place.
Well, gentlemen, we'd better be running along.
I'm sure you've seen enough.
- And I think - We send this back home to laboratory.
I had no idea it was so late.
If you gentlemen will excuse me, it's time to go feed my plants.
Yes, they get pretty cranky when they're hungry.
Plants?
Plants get hungry?
Cranky?
Well, after all, they're only human.
I'm quite proud of Mrs. Addams' hothouse.
She's raised these plants from tiny weeds.
Darling, would you?
Gardening is all a matter of proper feeding.
And these plants just love meat.
- Meat?
- Especially when it's medium rare.
Yes, they're really meat eaters.
I've seen them.
Especially that one.
It's a regular little glutton.
Oh, no, no, no.
Cleopatra, really.
Mr. Harris was only joking, darling.
She's really a sweet little thing.
She's terribly young.
Not very S-M-A-R-T.
But she's learning.
Open up, sweetheart.
Have some more.
There.
Yes.
This is plant, not animal?
- And it is learning?
- She's quite slow, actually.
She's three years old and she can't even feed herself yet.
Open up, sweetheart.
Excuse me.
- This is big thing we have discovered.
Big.
- Very big.
They've learnt to breed plants that have the intelligence of humans.
And a mere woman has done this.
An American woman.
Perhaps they have gone further than this?
And Harris thought he could hide this from us.
It's all right.
We will learn the truth.
Take notes, Miri Haan.
Plenty notes.
Plenty notes.
Plenty notes.
The mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
- What is that?
- Just your imagination.
Don't let him pull your leg.
Thing is as real as any of us.
Thing, come up and meet our guests.
Thing.
Now, now.
Dear Thing, he doesn't know his own strength.
- Anything exciting in the mail, dear?
- Oh yes, lots of bills.
Wonderful.
Will you excuse us, please?
Is it real?
Muscle and bone, with a grip like iron.
They have made this.
A hand, a single hand by itself.
- It likes privacy.
- This is fantastic.
Take notes, Miri Haan.
Take notes.
American family has taken first step towards building robots.
First a plant that moves and thinks and then a hand of flesh and blood.
This is big.
- Very big.
- Bigger than big.
I write everything down.
Everything.
Beautiful wreck, isn't it?
- Beautiful wreck?
- Beautiful wreck?
Hello, I didn't know you were having company.
This is our Uncle Fester.
This is Mr. Klarpe and Mr. Haan.
- Of course, you know Mr. Harris.
- Howdy.
- I guess this'll have to wait.
- What'll wait, old boy?
Well, I was feeling a little run down and I just wanted to get myself recharged.
- Recharged?
- Recharged?
- It's just an expression.
- This is an expression, too?
Oh, no, this is a great little pepper-upper.
Would you like to see it work?
Uncle Fester, I'm sure these gentlemen wouldn't be interested.
No.
We'd be very interested.
Good.
Well, you'll have to crank it, Gomez.
- He's such an exhibitionist.
-  Oh, no.
I really am run down.
It's just a simple little treatment to build up his energy.
Yes, well, you see, I put this little wire in my ear.
This little generator does the rest.
Go ahead, Gomez.
- He really gets a charge out of this.
- Write, write.
You mean he is full of electricity?
Believe me, believe me, they're just playing a little joke on you.
It's a joke, huh?
Touch.
- That's a funny joke.
- Write!
Write!
I'm writing, I'm writing right now.
Stop!
Stop!
Stop it.
I'm sorry, Harris, but he did warn you.
It'll tingle for a while but then it'll wear off.
I feel so good now, I'm gonna go out and chase automobiles.
Wonderful hobby.
Stay away from water, Uncle Fester.
The last time he was recharged he took a shower and blew out every fuse in the house.
- Americans, in order to get energy - Energy.
-put electricity in ear.
- Ear.
- Like vitamins in stomach - Stomach.
-which we invented.
- Which we invented.
That reminds me, would you gentlemen care to join us in a snack?
- Oh, no, no, really.
- We stay.
- We stay.
- Excellent.
I'll ring for Lurch.
- This Lurch, is he servant?
- Yes, he's our butler.
Finally, we are to meet downtrodden member of the American slave class.
Poor, weak victim of exploitation.
It is strong bell.
You rang?
Lunch, Lurch.
And, oh, yes, Lurch, a cigar, please.
Thank you, Lurch.
Would you gentlemen care for a cigar?
- Oh, no, no, no.
- No, no, thank you.
Well, if you'll excuse me, I'll get Mrs. Addams.
Thank you, Lurch.
That is poor, weak slave?
- Miri Haan, take note.
- Take note.
- Servant of typical American family, robot.
- Robot.
- Wait a minute, that's not true.
- Is true.
- Third stage.
- Third stage?
What are you talking about?
Simple.
First stage plant, second stage hand, final product human robot.
Flood labor market.
- Flood labor market.
- This is ridiculous.
Lurch is no robot.
- Then what is he?
- Well, he's a I don't know exactly, but you'll never find another one like it.
How could be?
Is typical American family.
Typical!
I keep telling you.
It's the only one of its kind.
- Please, let's get out of here.
- Still trying to hide from us truth.
You still trying to pull bourgeois wool over our eyes.
I do hope you gentlemen enjoyed our modest table.
Was very good.
Most thoughtful of you to serve caviar in our honor.
- Caviar?
- The black fish eggs on toast.
Very good.
Oh, you mean eye of tadpole?
Eye of tadpole?
Blue-eyed tadpole is even tastier than black-eyed tadpole but it's off-season for blue-eyed tadpole.
Beef is good, too.
Not as good as in our country, but is good.
Mr. Haan, that wasn't beef.
That's breast of alligator.
Alligator?
How about that henbane sauce?
Specialty of the house.
Shall we repair to the living-room, gentlemen?
- You have been marvelous hostess.
- Thank you.
- Very nice.
- Very nice.
No sense in wasting this.
Tristan and Isolde love alligator.
Told you.
Care to make a wish?
Mother, I finished my Oh.
Company.
Gentlemen, this is our son, Pugsley.
Now, young man, what brought you racing in here so unceremoniously?
- I've finished my disintegrator gun.
- Well, that's nice, dear.
- Run outside and play.
- Would you like to see it work, sir?
I'm sure these gentlemen have no time to No, no, no.
Let's not disappoint the little fellow.
- So you build disintegrator gun, eh?
- That's right.
You mean you point disintegrator at something, pull trigger, and that something disappear?
That's right, sir.
Watch.
You mean you just point it I think you'd better play with this outside, Pugsley.
- It's rather hard on the bric-a-brac.
- Yes, Father.
Nice to have met you, sir.
Poor Mr. Harris.
Little things upset him so.
Very high-strung.
I'll have Lurch take care of him.
You rang?
Yes.
Lurch, would you take Mr. Harris to the guest room?
He needs a bit of rest.
Oh, please, I don't need anything, l Come.
Very hospitable.
Never mind that.
The little fellow, he made that gun himself?
He just can't keep out of mischief.
Remember the anti-gravity machine he made, and what happened when he turned it on the postman?
Oh, yes, that was amusing.
The mailman just went floating off up in the air.
He really hated to come down.
He said the floating was so much easier on his feet.
He needs to rest.
Well, be my guest.
I just had the whole thing sharpened.
- Oh, no, no.
- Or maybe you'd prefer the iron maiden?
These spikes will help you keep nice and still.
It's very restful.
I don't need any rest, I'm fine.
Please just put me down.
All right.
That'll be all, Lurch.
You know, Mr. Harris, there is an art in relaxing.
Well, I'll never master it in this menagerie.
I almost got wiped out by a ray gun.
That Pugsley.
Such a showoff.
That's how we lost Cousin Creep.
There he was, giggling and laughing and suddenly there he wasn't, still giggling and laughing.
It was kind of eerie.
But that was old Creepy.
He could always take a joke.
Well The impression those two men are getting in this house, it could disrupt international relations.
I did think they were getting a little bored.
What if I was to go in and do some parlor trick?
I can saw a woman in half.
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Oh, yes.
It goes The only trouble I have is getting her together again.
Very strange man.
That is restful.
I'm very worried.
This is not what we expected.
How can you expect what is so unexpected?
We thought average Americans were fools.
Now we learn they are geniuses.
-  Dangerous geniuses.
- Electricity and eerie robots.
Ray guns built by little boys already.
I will make full report.
From now on, we must learn to respect all Americans.
Is not safe to offend these people.
Is not safe.
Rather be friend than meet end.
Well, gentlemen, have you found out all you want to know - about us typical Americans?
- We have.
Though you try hard to keep us from learning truth.
I was just doing my duty.
- Now we say goodbye to our hosts.
- Oh, yes, let's get moving.
- I just made $100,000.
- Really?
How nice.
Oops, just lost it again.
C'est la guerre.
Tish, when you speak French you drive me wild.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Gomez, darling, control yourself.
I think perhaps we better leave.
Very thoughtful.
We wish to thank you for a most enlightening day.
You've brightened our day, too.
We were about to settle down to our everyday routine.
No notes.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
- Good night.
You know, darling, I've been thinking.
The simple life is really the best.
You're right.
Uncle Fester, are you sure this'll help you get rid of your headache?
Keep going.
- That's it.
- Good.
Darling, you look so serene and happy when you're throwing knives.
Family trait.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello, this is Mrs. Addams speaking.
Why, hello, Mr. Harris.
Really?
Well, how nice of you to call.
Goodbye.
Gomez, that was that nice Mr. Harris.
He says our guests have cut their trip short and have gone home to make a full report.
- Well, that's too bad.
- Oh, no.
Mr. Harris says he's glad they're gone.
He said he overheard them talking about taking Lurch with them for scientific purposes.
Scientific purposes.
The things people will do to get a good servant.
Most ungracious.
Let's not give them another thought.
Back to our own beautiful world.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family  Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family - Lovely day, isn't it?
- Yes.
The chill goes right through you.
Look at them.
Oh, they have such good times together.
- Well, here we are.
- Is this the Addams house?
Yep.
Are you sure this is the place you wanna go to?
Why, yes.
Okay.
You know, it's not too late.
I could still take you back into town and turn you over to those Travelers Aid.
- No, thank you.
- Okay, lady.
I wonder who that could be?
It may not be a who.
It may be a what.
You optimist.
A relative.
- Morticia?
It's me.
- Cousin Melancholia!
Oh, darling!
Gomez, you remember Melancholia.
Who could forget that face?
I know I should have called, but everything happened so fast.
- Everything?
- It's Fred.
- My intended.
- He jilted you.
Well, I can't really say.
He just took back his ring, sold his farm and joined the Foreign Legion.
That is kind of indefinite.
I just didn't know what to do.
I'm glad you came to us in your hour of trial.
And you remember Mama?
I always said that you'd grow up to be a beauty.
Oh, Mama, you haven't changed a bit.
And you haven't lost a bit of your looks.
The vain old thing takes hours to get herself together.
It certainly shows.
Darling, why don't you go upstairs and freshen up and we'll talk it all over later.
Follow me.
Oh.
It's so good to be where you feel at home.
I'd better make her a nice hot cup of henbane juice.
Thank you, Mama.
Gomez, is there anything we can do to help Melancholia?
Well, if we can't help her, who can?
- We have to find her a man.
- But where?
Darling, you have so many vast business interests, you must know someone.
Well, let's see now.
There's old Charlie Carlisle the accountant.
- No, he's dead.
- He wouldn't be right.
Melancholia needs someone dashing, handsome, charming.
Like you, darling.
Carinito, you're really making it tough.
Now, now, now, Cleopatra, you're much too young to take tea.
Yes, indeed.
That's right.
Mmm-hmm.
Well, she'd make a perfect wife.
Yes, I see.
Uh-huh.
Well, then, it's obvious I have the wrong number.
- Any luck?
- Seven refusals.
Fortunately, three of them were wrong numbers.
We just have to keep trying.
What about Ed Franzen, the fellow who works at the monument company?
- Much too flighty.
- You're right.
Even when he's carving those inscriptions he can't stop giggling.
- Darling, have you tried your salt mine?
- No, by Jove!
They used to have a pretty lively crowd down there.
I just know this is gonna work.
It's got to, I'm running out of companies.
Hello?
Sutton?
Addams here.
Say, we've got a ravishing young cousin here who's just dying for some company.
Oh, well, thanks anyway.
Keep the salt rolling.
- Nothing?
- Nothing.
But don't despair, we'll find someone.
- How about a marriage broker?
- Capital idea!
I know just the one.
Hasty Marriage.
The same one we got for Cousin Gripe.
Hasty Marriage?
How are you fixed for grooms?
Really?
He says they've got a complete selection.
How romantic.
Tell them to send over a few, and then Melancholia can take her pick.
How about sending over a few samples?
Oh, you know, one tall, one short, one fat, one thin.
Better make that two thins.
The name is Addams.
Hello?
Hello?
I think we were disconnected.
It's just as well.
I think we should get one of our own.
You're right, we should.
- Lurch.
- Oh, dear, not Lurch.
- He's such a playboy.
- That's all an act.
You'll see.
You rang?
Lurch, have you ever given thought to the blissful joys of marriage?
You see?
Underneath that devil-may-care, he's a sentimental softie.
Lurch, we have a lovely girl for you.
Sweet, soft and soulful.
I thought you wanted him for Melancholia.
I'm talking about Melancholia.
Now, now, Lurch, control yourself.
You mustn't appear overanxious.
Now, about the wedding date.
- Obviously he prefers a long engagement.
- Nonsense.
Two people so ideally suited.
Why wait?
- How about eloping tonight?
- Please.
Well, it is a bit hasty.
How about tomorrow night?
We'll all go together.
We'll make it a combination elopement and picnic.
Darling, somehow I don't think Lurch takes to the idea of an elopement.
All right, forget the elopement, we'll just go on the picnic.
It's a lovely idea!
But I do believe Melancholia would rather be married.
No.
By Jove, Morticia, I'm beginning to believe you were right.
He is a playboy.
Very well, Lurch, you may go.
But, remember, there will never be another Melancholia.
Never.
They would have made a lovely couple.
I just love weddings.
They always make me cry.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
Thing?
Have you ever given thought to the blissful joys of marriage?
The Things of today.
Forget it.
I think Melancholia would prefer a professional man.
A doctor.
Or a lawyer.
No, no, no.
Not me.
I will not go back to that Addams house, never.
But a deal like this.
Think of your wife and children.
- I have no wife and children.
- Then think of mine.
- This deal could mean millions.
- Not worth it.
Come on now, Harvey, you have to.
This is the chief reason I brought you back into the firm.
You're the only lawyer in our office who's had any contact with them.
I would rather have contact with a nest of scorpions.
Oh, come on, now.
So the family is a little eccentric.
The point is we have a job to do.
If it means going back to that house, I am not going to do it.
What am I asking you to do?
An important client wants something Addams has.
All you have to do is go over there and discuss it with him.
Go on, make an appointment.
I knew I could depend on you.
Mr. Addams, please.
Oh, he's not home?
The whole family's gone on a world cruise?
The whole family's gone on a world cruise.
Try it now.
First I need a good stiff drink.
It's no use, I can't find a man anywhere.
Oh, poor Melancholia.
Doomed to spinsterhood.
Oh, Melancholia, darling, we were just talking about you.
- I know.
Nobody wants me.
- Oh, what nonsense.
No.
I'm cursed.
Fred isn't the first tragedy in my life.
I got as far as the altar with Elmer.
- What happened?
- I got there but Elmer didn't.
- He just ran off.
- Foreign Legion?
- South America.
- That is better climate.
Well, darling, it's obvious.
They felt unworthy.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Addams speaking.
Oh, hello, Mr. Harvey.
Just a moment.
Darling, it's that nice young lawyer, Mr. Harvey.
He wants to talk to you.
Not now, this is all too disturbing.
Mr. Harvey, I'm afraid Mr. Addams can't come to the phone right now.
He's involved in a little family problem.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'm sure an old bachelor Like myself can't be of any help.
Bye.
It's no use.
He didn't even get on the phone.
Your problem is solved.
- Mama!
What in the world?
- Love dust.
Don't you remember?
Worked wonders for you and Gomez.
Oh, of course.
How thoughtful of you, Mama.
- It'll bring the men howling.
- Are you sure?
Well, we'd better use a double dose.
- There, that ought to do it.
- Thank you, Mama.
What's so funny?
- Gomez, she's crying.
- Oh.
Darling, don't you worry, we'll find you a man.
You may have to lower your standards a bit.
Oh, I feel just awful bothering you two.
And interfering with your business.
- You probably offended that man.
- Oh, no, Mr. Harvey's very understanding, - even though he is a bachelor.
- Yes, he's a very - Bachelor!
- Bachelor!
Yes?
Oh, of course.
Mr. Addams.
- Look, I don't want to impose.
- Impose?
My dear fellow, to you the Addams home is Liberty Hall.
It's just a little business matter.
- Excellent.
Plan to stay all evening.
- Thank you.
- Well, how does it look?
- Wonderful.
Mr. Harvey is a very suave, sophisticated man.
So let's get rid of these homey things, shall we?
You can wear anything of mine that you like.
Oh, they're gorgeous!
- Oh, Cousin Morticia, you're too generous.
- Darling, what's family for?
Now come along to the mirror.
I want to pluck your eyebrows.
When I finish with you you won't recognize yourself.
- Is Mr. Harvey a real good friend of yours?
- Oh, yes.
He's a little bit shy and reserved.
I'm afraid you'll have to take him in hand.
In both hands.
Are you sure he'll come?
He's probably dying to come.
They're not home.
Well, some other time.
Harvey, old man!
- So good to see you again.
- Nice to be back.
- Lurch, a drink for our friend.
- Oh, thank you, I'm not thirsty.
Nonsense, it's something special.
The Vat '68.
Look, Mr. Addams, I don't wanna take up your time.
I know you're a very busy man.
But all we want is an option on an itty-bitty, worthless piece of African land you've got.
Worthless?
With all those fine subterranean bat caves?
Come, come, Harvey, you're not talking to a child.
Here we are.
Superb.
- Really, I don't want any of that.
- Please, Harvey, I never drink alone.
Besides, you look as though you can use a drink.
You must've had a pretty hard day.
Oh, the day was all right.
It's the night.
- Well, drink up, there's plenty more.
- I'll bet.
It really hits the spot.
Harvey, you're not drinking.
Wait.
Now we have something to drink to.
To the ladies.
Ever seen two lovelier girls?
I know the one on the right is your wife.
But what is Who's the other one?
That's Mrs. Addams' cousin, Melancholia.
You like her?
- Oh, yes, she's lovely.
- Good.
She's your date.
- Am I dead?
- Of course not, silly.
Oh, too bad.
- Where are the others?
- They thought we'd like to be alone.
I don't know about we, but I would.
- I've got to put something in my car.
- Something in your car?
- What?
- Me.
Out for a little air, old man?
This has been a rather heady experience.
- You gave us quite a scare.
- I gave you a scare?
I thought I was gonna be a widow before I was a bride.
- I beg your pardon?
- Melancholia does that to a man.
But don't you worry about it.
You'll feel a lot better when you get some food in your stomach.
Mama is cooking up a real surprise.
I am so hungry I could eat a wolf.
Gomez, you guessed it!
Superb dinner.
That belladonna sauce really brings out the flavor.
- You didn't eat much, Harvey.
- The excitement.
Love is that way.
I suddenly felt all chilled and goosebumpy, too.
Well, a little bicarb and you'll be fine.
Would you two lovebirds like to dance?
- No, thank you.
- Love to.
Only first I have to fix my face.
Now, if you'll just Look over these contracts What was that?
Love dust.
Mama is an incurable romantic.
All she ever thinks about is love, love, love.
Well, all I ever think about is business, business, business.
Excellent, a woman needs a good provider.
Especially Melancholia.
She's a bit extravagant, I'm afraid.
But she's so much in love she's about to burst.
Well, that would solve everything.
I mean, your cousin's a lovely girl.
Too lovely for just one man.
So why don't I call you tomorrow?
We can talk over the deal on the phone.
- You wanted something, sir?
- Just out.
Oh, nonsense, the evening is just getting underway.
- I'm back.
- You see?
Oh, Melly.
You light up the room.
I am sure you and Melancholia have lots of things to talk about.
So why don't you just sit down?
But watch him, Melly darling, he's a charmer.
- He's one of our most dashing bachelors.
- Is that nice, Mr. Harvey?
When did you decide to become a bachelor?
Just tonight.
Now, about this deal My!
You're a jumpy one.
Mr. Addams, it seems they've discovered oil on your game preserve in Nairobi.
- Did you say oil?
- Oh, just a few drops.
Oh, Gomez, Mr. Harvey doesn't want to talk about any old oil.
But I do, I do!
Oh, I can't wait to hear him say that to a preacher.
- Now, if you'll just sign right here - I have to think about it, Harvey.
After all, I do owe something to the bats.
But we don't want all of it.
Just one teeny little well.
Oh, Gomez, give it to him.
Nairobi's such a romantic place.
Those lovely nights with the hyenas howling.
Makes a perfect spot for a honeymoon.
You're so right, Mrs. Addams, you really have a good business - Honeymoon?
Whose honeymoon?
- Why, yours and Melancholia's.
- Provided she accepts your proposal.
- I accept.
- Welcome to the family, old man.
- But No buts.
I'll take these into the library and look them over.
In the meantime, you two can go in the conservatory and make your plans.
We'll drink a toast to the bride and groom.
You rang?
Champagne for the newlyweds, Lurch.
Mr. Addams, maybe I better go with you and explain some of those clauses.
And leave your love-starved Little dream girl all alone?
- Nonsense.
- But Don't they make a handsome couple?
He's a man, she's a woman.
Perfect match.
Hard to believe we just met.
This whole evening has been pretty unbelievable.
- Don't you think it's fate?
- No.
Just my luck.
Oh, what a lovely thing to say!
- Kiss me.
- Kiss you?
You don't want me to tell Gomez you're afraid, do you?
No, no, please, let's keep him out of this.
Well, then.
Kiss me.
I'll keep my eyes closed.
- Is it all right if I close mine, too?
- Of course, silly.
Oh, no!
You are a bashful boy.
Maybe this will cure you.
I just love weddings, don't you, darling?
Mmm-hmm.
- They're so romantic.
- Out of my way.
- All right, where is she?
- Who are you?
Gomez Addams here.
Never mind that, where's Melancholia?
Fred.
I thought you'd joined the Foreign Legion.
Not the Foreign Legion, you rock-head.
The American Legion.
- But, dear, you took the ring back.
- I had to.
Your finger was turning green.
- I brought you a nice brass one.
- Oh, thank you!
Oh, Ralph, this is my fiance, Fred.
Fred, this is my fiance, Ralph.
You mean I'm gonna have to fight for you?
- Oh, no, no.
- Okay.
This is so romantic.
Come on.
Thanks for the hospitality.
Well!
Oh, Mr. Harvey?
Mr. Harvey.
Wake up.
Wake up, Mr. Harvey.
- Am I still alive?
- Very much.
And here are the signed papers.
You've got a deal.
Don't you worry about that ungrateful Melancholia.
I've got lots of cousins.
I have to get this nice and clean for Pugsley.
- What is it?
A telescope?
- An African blowgun.
That reminds me.
Do you miss Melancholia?
No, indeed, my dear, I'm glad she's gone.
Ungrateful wench.
Now, now, remember blood is thicker than water.
Thank heaven.
She certainly wasn't the right girl for Harvey.
- He's a nice man, isn't he?
- Yes, indeed.
I ought to give him more of my legal business.
I think that's an excellent idea.
Why don't you call him?
I think I'll do that.
There.
It's all finished.
What do you think, darling?
Do you think Uncle Crimp will like his new sweater?
I hope so.
Looks like a perfect fit.
Mr. Harvey, please.
Oh, I see.
He's left town.
- For long?
- I'm afraid so.
He's joined the Foreign Legion.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family A little higher and to the right, Thing.
Yes.
That's it.
Thank you, Thing.
The mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh, Lurch, it's for you.
Aren't you going to open it and see what's in it?
I already know.
It's your annual invitation to the Butlers' Ball.
Which you never accept.
Lurch, wouldn't you like to go to that ball just once?
Why doesn't he want to go to that ball?
He's becoming progressively shyer.
Did it ever occur to you that he might not be normal?
Nonsense, my dear.
He's just as normal as you and l. But he should go to that ball.
It would be very good for him.
He needs to get out more.
Make more friends.
Perhaps you're right.
But I can handle this situation.
I'm sure you can, darling.
You're so masterful.
Tish, when you pat my cheek that way it drives me wild.
-Gomez, darling, control yourself.
-Never.
Darling, you're forgetting about Lurch.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch, I think we have a problem.
-The problem is you, Lurch.
-Me?
Mrs. Addams and I have had a serious talk about you, Lurch, and we've decided that this year you should attend the Butlers' Ball.
Lurch, there's something behind this.
What is it?
You can tell us.
-I'm a wallflower.
-What?
I can't dance.
It's so simple.
You can learn in no time.
"Come, and trip it as ye go On the light fantastic toe" -Shakespeare.
-Milton.
-By Jove, you're right.
-Lurch, you can learn to dance.
The Watusi, the Hully Gully, the Pick and Shovel Oh, no.
-You must develop some outside interests.
-You can become stagnant.
Really?
Look at Mr. Addams.
He's always developing outside interests.
Right now I have the most enviable collection of coroner's reports in the neighborhood.
Lurch, we're speaking to you this way because you're more than an employee to us.
You're like one of the family.
And as head of the family I've decided that you're going to the Butlers' Ball.
It's for your own good, Lurch.
We wanna make you happy.
Look, it's so simple.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
-We'll get you a teacher.
-That's a marvelous idea, dear.
Why don't you call the dance studio and have them send over an instructress right away?
-A girl?
-Well, of course.
-Father was right.
-About what, Lurch?
My being a butler.
What did he want you to be?
A jockey.
Okay, Mrs. Marshall, we'll send an instructress right over.
Yes, I'll make sure she's young.
Dorothy.
Go over to Mrs. Marshall's.
Her grandfather wants to learn the Mashed Potato.
Please, Mr. Walters, give me another chance.
Sally, I'm sorry.
You're too fresh to the customer.
But, Mr. Walters Fred Walters Dance Studio.
I'm sorry, we got nobody available.
I'm available.
Mr. Addams, we suddenly have somebody available.
Yeah, right.
Girlie, anything you earn on this job is all yours.
Here.
Good luck.
Dance instructress should be here any minute now.
Morticia, who moved this urn?
I don't know, darling.
Mama, I suppose.
I didn't notice.
Really, my dear.
You should keep an eye on these things.
You know how close Uncle Droop liked being to Aunt Drip.
-Must be the instructress.
- Lurch.
-Yes, sir.
-Dance instructress is here, Lurch.
Now, come, Lurch.
There's nothing to be afraid of.
It's just a question of rhythm, Lurch.
We'll leave you alone and let you have complete privacy.
There's no need to be self-conscious.
Excellent idea.
Oh, and, Lurch, do try to be a little friendly.
Let her see that charming leer of yours.
Great form, Lurch.
But you're not keeping time to the music.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Rhythm, Lurch.
Rhythm.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
She's fainted, sir.
Fainted?
That's strange.
Why would she do that?
Here, put her on the sofa.
What's the matter with the lady?
Well, there she goes again.
Pugsley, take your toad out of here.
Things like this upset him.
She's obviously not a well person.
Quick.
Someone get a glass of water.
Thank you, Thing.
Well, there she goes again.
What's all the commotion, Gomez?
Fred Walters sent us a fainter.
Oh.
Well, maybe we better get her some smelling salts.
Thank you, Thing.
I'll have to make a complaint.
Oh, no, don't do that.
I always faint when I meet new people.
Oh, you poor dear, you must be painfully shy.
Oh, no, I'm really very friendly.
One, two, three.
One, two, three.
Not me, him.
Oh, sorry.
All right, buster.
I didn't know fainting was contagious.
Practicing your sword swallowing, darling?
No, I just felt a little congestion in my throat.
That cleared it up fine.
Dear, I can't find Lurch.
He did seem depressed by all that Butlers' Ball talk.
You don't suppose he did anything drastic, do you?
Of course not.
Otherwise your little vulture would be circling the area.
That's true.
I'm going to have the children look for him.
Little Pugsley has the nose of a bloodhound.
As a matter of fact, it's his best feature.
Lurch?
Lurch?
Where are you, Lurch?
Lurch!
The playroom?
It isn't nice to tattle, Thing, but thank you anyways.
Lurch?
Where are you, Lurch?
It's me, Wednesday.
Do you hear me?
Thank you, Thing.
That's not nice.
Don't you trust me?
I'm your friend.
Just because we want you to go to the Butlers' Ball?
lt'll be fun.
I like being miserable.
You might find a nice girl to be miserable with.
-I'll teach you to dance.
-You?
Grandmama taught me.
She's a great dancer.
Really.
I'll have you dancing in no time.
Now smile.
That's much better.
Morticia, Consolidated Fuzz just hit 212.
I sold it for six.
Saved all that tax.
Brilliant.
Darling, I want you to know that Wednesday has taught Lurch how to dance.
Capital.
She wants us to come and see right now.
Of course.
I knew Lurch would pick it up quickly.
He's such a nimble one.
Ready.
No!
Morticia, Consolidated Fuzz is back to six.
-Oh.
-I bought in again at 212.
What an unusual system you have, dear.
Darling, I want to talk to you about Lurch.
Ballet doesn't seem to be his cup of tea.
No.
I think he needs something more modern.
-So I've decided to teach him.
-Wonderful.
I can just see his face.
You, Mrs. Addams?
You don't know what you're missing, Lurch.
Mrs. Addams won the Twist award at the Funeral Directors' Ball.
They awarded her the silver urn.
Darling, you'll have me blushing.
On with the dance.
That's it, Lurch.
Now you're getting it.
-What's the matter?
-I think he slipped a cog.
Poor dear, I believe he overdid it.
He must have thrown his back out.
Excellent diagnosis, child.
Don't worry, Lurch.
You're in the finest hands since Dr. Schweitzer.
Oh, it's true, Lurch.
Mr. Addams' treatment for Grandmama's back had the whole medical world agog.
Agog?
Aghast.
Not so hard, dear.
He's tall enough already.
Sorry, my love.
I don't know my own strength.
He's turning a beautiful shade of red.
It's more magenta.
A very popular color this year.
Well, we better give it another go.
Well, one more.
Darling, you've done it again.
-He's as good as new.
-Another triumph for medical science.
Some day the Nobel Prize.
-Couldn't accept it.
-Why not?
Run off to Sweden and leave the children?
Of course you're right.
More.
More.
Oh, no, Lurch.
This could become habit-forming.
Now, on your feet and on with the dancing lesson.
Darling Dear, I think Lurch is a bit shy with you.
Should we call for another instructress?
Waste of smelling salts.
Lurch not only needs a great teacher but also a great psychologist, a brilliant tactician, a rigid taskmaster.
You?
I never could fool you.
Now remember, Lurch.
You're not dancing with Mr. Addams.
It's not me, Lurch.
It's a beautiful senorita.
Fiery, alluring, smoldering.
And you, Lurch, are the proud prince of the Pampas.
You draw the senorita closer.
-What's wrong, Lurch?
-You didn't shave.
Senoritas never do.
By Jove, I think he's got it.
What was that?
Quick.
The rack!
Darling, I thought the rack helped your back.
Oh, it did.
It did.
I'm just resting up a bit.
Wonderful idea.
Here.
Lurch is getting into his new costume.
Little Wednesday picked it out.
I know.
I'm afraid his heart's still not in it, though.
Darling, do you think we're doing the right thing, making him go?
We must not indulge fear.
I remember my Cousin Blob.
-Deathly afraid of ghosts.
-Ghosts?
Now he's one himself.
Yes.
I hear him on dark stormy nights.
Darling, those strange sounds from the attic aren't Cousin Blob.
-No?
-They're Grandma Squint.
You can tell from her superb cackle.
Yes.
Like music to my ears.
Lurch, you look magnificent.
MORTlClA: That costume.
It's you.
-Must l?
-Lurch, it's for your own good.
Darling, what do you think?
Fascinating, my dear.
But what is it?
It's my costume for the Butlers' Ball.
But you mustn't breathe a word of it to Lurch.
I want to make sure that he's not too alone.
That's very thoughtful, querida.
But don't worry.
The girls will flutter about him like moths around a flame.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, for the annual Fred Walters Dance Contest.
By special request, we're gonna have a tango.
Here he comes.
That was a wonderful thing you did, Tish.
Oh, darling, I didn't do anything.
Besides, I'm just glad to be out of that horrible costume and back into my beautiful dress.
You didn't do so badly yourself.
How did you get them to change it to a tango contest?
I promised them a large contribution to their pet charity.
How nice of them to have charities for pets.
Well, it's been a tiring day.
I think I'll go down and relax a bit on the nail bed.
Yes.
Darling, you think of everything.
Good morning, my dear.
You seem quite happy.
I am, darling.
My thorns came in so nice and pointy this year.
They talk about green thumbs.
You've got a red thumb.
Hello?
-It's the fainter.
-The dance instructress?
Hello?
Yes.
Oh, that's wonderful, Miss O'Rourke.
Fine.
Goodbye.
She says her boss found out about Lurch winning the contest and he's given her a long-term contract.
Oh, that's wonderful.
Darling, you know, she did encourage Lurch.
I think we ought to buy her a nice gift.
Yes.
But what?
I've got it.
A great big bottle of smelling salts.
She can use it.

Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch 's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family See the spider on the maypole Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la That was lovely, darling.
Those old English madrigals are enchanting.
A bit sentimental, but lovely.
Madrigals.
Paintings.
I should've gone on that toad hunt with Mama.
How long do I have to hold this silly pose, Morticia?
We'll take a break in a few minutes, Uncle Fester.
Just hold still.
My dear, there is no end to your talents.
That is Uncle Fester.
The twinkle in the eye, the inscrutable smile.
Darling, I haven't even started on Uncle Fester yet.
To be sure.
But then, you've always had a way with skulls.
Uncle Fester, what are you doing with my piggy bank?
Is that your piggy bank?
It doesn't look like a pig.
Anyway, I'm posing.
Don't you ever spend any money?
Your mother is painting the gravedigger scene from Hamlet.
"Alas, poor Yorick!
I knew him, Horatio".
That's one of the most hilarious things old Shakespeare ever wrote.
He always tickled me so.
Mama's landed.
Seems mighty careless.
We'd better have a look.
Oh, man.
Like, where am l?
Oh, forget it, Dad.
I know.
Nice and clammy.
You had us frightened, young man.
You got me a little frightened right now, but a couple of aspirin and it's gonesville for you spooks.
Spooks!
Well, now, there's no need for flattery.
Thank you.
I think I'd better get him some of Mama's painkillers.
They're absolutely unbelievable.
Hey, you cats are for real.
Cats?
Well, you must mean Kitty.
She's real, all right.
Oh, man, I'm wracked up worse than I thought.
Nonsense.
You'll be all right.
A couple of clean breaks, but Uncle Fester will have you fixed up in no time.
-Right!
-I better see about those pills.
-All right.
Cool it, man.
I'm fine.
I'm okay.
-Glad to hear it, son.
Your motorcycle's fine, too.
Frame was cracked in a couple of spots, but I welded them up.
Oh, the bike.
You'll need a new drive chain, too.
Yeah, well, just send the bill to the dead-letter office, will you?
Hey, look, before I cut out of here, fill me in, will you?
What's with all these oddballs around here?
Oddballs?
What oddballs?
They went thataway.
Oh, this I gotta see.
You kids really live in this crumb box?
We like it.
It's so nice and eerie.
I wish I could say as much for the coop I just flew.
You mean you don't like your home?
Oh, sure, sure.
Like a stir bird loves his cell.
-Dig?
-Only graves.
You break me up, sawed-off.
Look, where's my box?
That's pretty.
Could you please play some more, sir?
Look, catch my act at Carnegie Hall, will you?
Children, who wants to help Mother pluck the albatross?
-I do!
It's my turn!
-It's my turn!
Here we are.
Swallow this pill.
You'll be a new man.
I'd rather stick with the old one.
Look, you take it.
Well, thank you.
By Jove, that hit the spot.
I really needed that.
What's this?
Don't tell me.
A modern streamlined flail.
A flail?
We seem to have mutual interests.
I'm a devotee of weaponry, too.
Much to be said for the sturdy design of the older model, but for skull-point accuracy I'll take this one anytime.
Are you putting me on, man?
"Putting me on".
You certainly turn a colorful phrase.
-Look, don't bug me.
-Bug me.
Sounds Elizabethan.
I'll have to check that.
Mrs. Addams and I are fascinated by the study of language and philology.
And your jacket is very interesting, too.
Nice touch of an ancient coat of arms.
-Who's your tailor?
-Tailor?
-War surplus.
-War surplus?
Listen, man, I need that part.
But pronto, so I'm not fooling around with no peasant.
Get me the top cat, like right now.
I'm so sorry the young man wouldn't join us.
Yes.
Casserole of spleen is tastier than ever, Lurch.
It's that pinch of hemlock, sir.
Darling, have you noticed how much livelier things have been since our young friend dropped in?
Yes, just being with a fine, upstanding man like that makes you feel good all over, doesn't it?
Listen, meathead, I don't care if you are the top cat.
Like, I want some action, huh?
It's only a crummy motorcycle part, so let's get with it, man.
Well, check and double-check, will you?
Why don't you geese get organized?
Never heard such descriptive language.
Such rhythm.
Such cadence.
A complete individualist.
And we thought good breeding was a thing of the past.
I dig him the most.
Crazy.
See, it's all a matter of exposure.
It's rubbing off on them already.
How soon can you get it over here?
Tomorrow?
But, man, you don't know what I'm up against.
I'll go ape if I have to have to drag my anchor around here till tomorrow.
Any news, Rocky?
Oh, yeah, like, the greatest.
Splendid.
Perhaps you can join us after all.
No, thanks.
I'm not hungry.
Come, now.
Show me the man who can resist my dear wife's puree of sea slug.
You're looking at him.
-How do you feel about braised giraffe?
-Awful.
Look, look, I'll dig you people later.
I'm gonna cut out for a pad somewhere.
And if the motorcycle part gets here, well, then l -What's the matter, Rocky?
-My knee, my knee.
Well, you're lucky it happened here.
Morticia's a great hand at first aid.
Born with a red thumb.
-You rang?
-Lurch, hot oil and plenty of it.
And a good stout length of rope.
And Lurch, don't forget the leeches.
Better dust off the rack.
How is our little patient?
Nothing like a good, old-fashioned pillory for complete rest.
My dear?
Uh-huh.
You're still feeling any pain?
Lady, after this I don't even feel my leg.
Good.
A sign of healing.
Here we are.
I'm sure you'll be very comfortable on this.
You wanna bet?
Can't beat this for solid comfort.
Yeah, solid.
Now, Rocky, I'm sure you're very tired and you'd like to rest.
If there's anything else you want, just shriek.
Come on, curly.
How much longer on this gig?
Cool it, Rock.
Couple of flips of the wrist and coolsville.
I'll grab my gear.
No one, but no one, can capture the wistful expression of a hyena Iike you, dear.
Tish?
Tish?
Woolgathering again?
I'm sorry, darling.
I was just thinking.
About Rocky?
Mmm.
You know, the children are becoming very fond of him.
Yes.
And he can't quite hide his affection for them, either.
He's brought charm and individuality into our lives.
I wish we could keep him.
Mmm.
Well, that does it.
I'm going to fire off a strongly-worded letter to the editor.
It's about time.
That's the third day this week that paper's been late.
Yes, I can understand one day, or even two, but Well, well, listen to this, Morticia.
"Organizer of the giant merger is well-known tycoon "Rockland Cartwright ll".
Does that ring a bell?
Yes, I believe it does.
That's your vulture's feeding bell.
I was talking about Just a minute.
-You rang?
-Yes, Lurch.
Would you be a good chap and fetch me the registration slip on Rocky's motorcycle, please?
Thank you, Lurch.
You may go.
Excellent servant.
Anticipates my every wish.
And so cheerful, too.
Just as I thought.
Rockland Cartwright lll.
And our tycoon is Rockland Cartwright ll.
Obviously father and son.
Darling, you're right again.
Hey, Rocky, wanna help us make some hand grenades?
It's for a surprise attack.
It'll be a blast.
Look, the only blast that I'm doing is off this pad.
You mean you're cutting out?
Please stay, Rocky.
Stay here?
Look, nothing, but nothing, could make me stay here.
My dad!
Except for one thing, and he's heading for this door.
-Who's that?
-Never mind.
But look, kids Look, he's gonna ask for me, so you kids tell him you never saw me before.
Dig?
Well?
Gee, Rocky, we couldn't do that.
It would be lying.
So what?
Look, kids, I'm in a tough spot.
Mr. Cartwright, your son has run away three times already.
Sergeant, I've just got to find that son of mine.
So this time I'll do all the talking.
-You just try to look halfway intelligent.
-Yes, Mr. Cartwright.
Well, well.
Hello, children.
Have you seen a young man with a black jacket and a black leather cap?
Carrying a guitar?
Riding a motorcycle?
Riding a motorcycle?
That's right.
Have you seen him?
-Nope.
-Nope.
Another blank.
But I know he was last seen in this neighborhood.
-Put on another five men.
-Yes, sir.
Things are heating up a bit.
Okay, bring on the hand grenades.
-Wild.
-Wild.
Darling, did you notice this?
Today is Rocky's birthday.
By George, that's true.
Darling, he's done so many nice things for us.
I think the least we could do is give him a surprise birthday party.
Capital.
Now, let's see, there'll be ourselves and the children, and Uncle Fester, and Lurch, and Rocky's father Rocky's father?
Well, of course.
It wouldn't be the boy's birthday without his father here.
Yes.
By thunder, I can't wait to see the expression on old Cartwright's face when we tell him.
What?
Yes, you're quite right.
I'd love to attend my son's birthday party.
Where?
Don't worry.
I'll be there all right.
Even over the phone breeding will tell.
Like father, like son.
Now, darling, we want this to be a real surprise to Rocky.
So I'll instruct the children to keep it an absolute secret.
They're not to tell a living soul, or anyone else, for that matter.
-We know a secret.
-We know a secret.
-We know a secret.
-We know a secret.
Satan's coming to dinner.
That was last week.
Look, I'm gonna lay a little secret on you, kids.
I am gonna blow this popcorn stand.
We thought you liked it here.
You just can't go.
Why not?
'Cause we're having a birthday party for you.
But we're not supposed to tell you 'cause it's a surprise.
A birthday party for me?
For me?
Sure, Rocky.
It's your birthday.
Well, you kids laid a big favor on me.
I guess I can do the same for you.
I'll stick around.
Good!
Follow me.
Wait here.
Who's the manager of this broken-down funhouse?
No need to tell us, sir.
Rockland Cartwright ll, allow me to present my lovely wife, Morticia.
Never mind that.
Where is that good-for-nothing son of mine?
Mr. Cartwright, what charming modesty.
I demand that you release him Good heavens, another one.
You can call me Uncle Fester.
I'd rather call the Marines.
Now you get Rocky out here this minute or I'll Oh, no, that would spoil everything.
You are going to be the big surprise.
You see, the plan is for you to hide behind the aspidistra.
I did not come here to play games.
Behind the aspidistra.
Bully for you, Uncle Fester!
Oh, come on, Gomez.
You got to do it last time.
All right, Fester, have a go at it.
Rocky?
Would you come down here a minute, dear?
All right, Fester, let her rip.
Happy birthday.
Like a solid riff for another year, Rocksville.
Thank you, Mr. Addams.
Lay it on me, Rock.
Like we're the samesville.
And now, scattered about, very cleverly concealed, are your gifts.
All you have to do is find them.
Go on to it, Rock.
This is what I've always wanted, too.
-These are the best presents I ever -Wait, Rock.
There's one more.
Yes.
Go look.
You're getting cool, dear.
Now you're getting warmer.
Much warmer.
You're getting hot.
Very hot.
You're burning up.
Thanks a lot, Mr. and Mrs. Addams, you Nonsense.
We've already been thanked.
Come on, Son.
I'm getting you out of this rookery.
Listen, knock it off.
These people are my friends.
Friends?
Why, they're a bunch of kooks.
Well, they're my kind of kooks and they dig me the way I am.
No rebuild jobs like Okay, okay.
Bring on the handcuffs.
No more handcuffs, son.
Key to your motorcycle.
You're free to go, if that's what you want.
That's what I want.
I'll grab my gear.
CARTWRlGHT: You people accepted the boy just as he is.
I tried to press him into a mold.
If there's a kook around here, it must be me.
-Well, I'll get out of your hair.
-Dad.
You going my way?
Got a present for you, pal.
There you go.
Dad.
And this is for you, sawed-off.
Thanks, Rocky.
Well, so long, Rock.
Take it easy, kids.
Curly, there you go.
Mr. and Mrs. Addams, you You cats are all right.
Something fine and gracious has gone out of our lives.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Right.
Darling?
Are you sure that Zen-Yogi exercise is good for your mind?
It really keeps you on your toes.
Yes, I suppose it does.
Anything interesting in the paper tonight, dear?
Nothing much.
A few riots, a few revolutions.
Oh-ho.
Says here that Rocky's joined his father's firm.
I do hope the work doesn't throw him.
Don't worry, querida mia.
That's a boy with his feet firmly planted on the ground.
Just like you, darling.
A pleasant noise.
What is it?
That's what happens when you have a loose nut.

It's really very cultural, isn't it?
Mama can have her painting.
-Painting?
-She's gotten so, so arty.
She can't wait till you see it, Gomez.
Very well.
Coming up.
Alley-oop!
Oop!
By George, Mama!
This new technique of yours is a dandy.
It does give me a feeling of release.
-That's it.
You've done it.
-Not quite.
It still needs a little something.
Mama, I beg you, don't tamper with perfection.
Oh, trust Mama.
Superb.
It should be on exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum.
You're too kind.
But what I need is the eye of a critic.
-A critic?
-Yes.
Someone who'd give an unbiased opinion of my work.
If you don't believe me you can ask Uncle Fester.
Well, he's sweet, but he has an axe to grind.
That's just for recreation.
What I need is an outsider.
Very well, Mama.
I'll call in my friend, Bosley Swain.
Well, Bosley, what do you say?
Unbelievable.
I told you I knew great art.
Mr. Swain, am I expressing the real me?
Oh, it's the real you.
Couldn't be anybody else.
How sweet of you to say so.
What would you suggest as my next step?
A teacher.
Is there a teacher you could recommend for Mama?
No.
Really very nice of Bosley Swain, being so encouraging about Mama.
Mama's painting is most unusual.
Well, one thing is certain.
She has her own technique.
She throws that paint with a curve.
If you do find a teacher for her, make sure he's got a good arm.
Do you think the Zen-Yogi society will hang this picture of you in their office?
It'll fit in so perfectly with the rest of their decor.
You know, you and Mr. Swain are so flattering, but I wish he could have recommended a teacher for me.
I've got it.
The perfect teacher for you.
Picasso!
Picasso?
For me?
You rang?
Lurch, do you have any idea where Picasso might be?
Tahiti?
No, Lurch, that was the other painter fellow.
The one who hobnobbed with the native girls.
See what you can do on the phone, Lurch.
Try France.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
I wonder what Picasso's doing now.
The last I heard, he was fiddling around with ceramics.
-Paris.
-Thank you, Lurch.
Bonjour, mademoiselle.
Comment ca va?
Could you connect me with Mr. Picasso, the painter?
Lurch told me you had Paris on the line.
Could you switch me over to the Folies-Bergere?
I'd like to talk to my French pen pal.
-I thought Yvonne lived in a convent.
-No, she moved.
You don't talk to pen pals.
You write to them.
Darn.
Oh.
Well, thank you, operator.
That's odd, she never even heard of Picasso.
Mamacita!
We forgot our ancestral land!
Spain.
It's 3:00 in the morning there.
Do you suppose he'll be up?
Certainly.
Everyone in Spain is up half the night dancing and funning.
Let me try it.
-Would you like to?
-I'd love to.
Hello?
Yes, operator, yes, yes.
This is Picasso.
Sam Picasso.
All right.
Hello?
Mr. Picasso, the artist?
Could be.
Who wants to know?
The name is Addams, from America.
From America?
America?
Oh, that's -ls this call collect?
-Oh, no!
I hope I haven 't caught you at a bad time.
No.
No, dear lady, no.
As a matter of fact, I wasn't doing anything important tonight.
Good.
Then how about coming to America and living with us?
Could be.
But of my service, what did you have in mind?
Babysitter?
Gigolo?
Gardener?
Well, because I'm very good in all three of them.
I want you to teach me to paint.
Paint?
Oh, paint!
That's what I do better than best.
-Well, how soon can you leave?
-How soon can you send me the fare?
-lmmediately.
-I'm leaving.
Yankee Doodle went to town cha, cha, cha La, la, la, la, la, la, la La, la, la, la, la, la, la Hello.
Hello.
Who are you?
I'm Wednesday.
It's too bad what happened to your doll, eh?
She isn't a doll.
She's Mary, Queen of Scots.
Grandmama was telling us what happened to her, and my brother Pugsley chopped off her head.
PlCASSO: "Marie Antoinette".
"Little Red Riding Hood".
Little Red Riding Hood?
-She didn't die.
-The way we play it she does.
-ls your family home?
-They're always at home.
-I would like to see them.
-You would?
Yes.
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
Mother!
Father, Mr -Picasso.
-Picasso is here!
Addams here.
Welcome to America.
-This is America?
-Well, it's not all like this.
Not everyone has it this good.
Wednesday, run to Mr. Picasso's room and make sure the shades are drawn.
Yes, Father.
Here comes your pupil now, sir.
Oh, maestro.
I think I'm going to faint.
Not before I do.
Gomez, darling, what's all the excitement?
My lovely wife, Morticia.
The great Picasso.
I'm so glad you could come.
You know, it's strange.
I was under the impression that you were short and round and bald.
Darling, he's short and round.
You can't have everything.
If there's anything you'd like, just name it.
-What's for dinner?
-I'll go see.
Cocktails.
Thank you, Lurch.
That's very thoughtful of you.
A vintage brew from the Addams wine cellars, Mr. Picasso.
Especially for you.
To Mr. Picasso.
Long may he live.
At least a couple more days.
I thought you might like another little snack.
-What's in it?
-Pate of yak.
-Sounds delicious.
-lt is.
Try one.
-ls different.
-Yes.
Yes, it is.
By George, Mama, that is a dazzler!
I never could have done it without Mr. Picasso.
What shall I do next, Mr. Picasso?
I would suggest, senora, that you practice your brushstrokes up and down, up and down.
See how it's Very bad.
No, no, no.
Your wrist is too stiff.
Flexibility, flexibility.
Oh, yes.
To get a better view you've got to move back.
As far back as upstairs.
You come for dinner, eh?
Very good, very good.
Keep up, keep up.
-lsn't he inspiring?
-He certainly is.
Not only that, he's the only guest we've ever had who appreciates pate of yak.
I hope that's not the ladies from the charity bazaar.
My paintings aren't nearly ready.
It's probably Bosley Swain.
I invited him over to see the improvement in your work.
-Mr. Swain.
-Swain, good to see you.
I am terribly busy, but you said that your mother had a new teacher and that I was in for a big surprise.
There it is, old man.
Feast your eyes.
Who is the culprit?
I mean, teacher?
-Mr. Picasso.
-Picasso?
Yes.
Came clear over from Spain.
Brought some of his own masterpieces.
There it is.
-A genuine Picasso.
-Yes, a genuine Sam Picasso.
Worth about 40 cents.
This man is a bum.
Been trading on the Picasso name for 20 years.
Nonsense.
If this isn't Pablo Picasso, then we've discovered a great new talent.
Oh, come now.
I'll admit he showed promise as a young man, but he hasn't painted anything but wallpaper in years now.
Someday that wallpaper will be worth a fortune.
You take my advice.
If you want a teacher, you throw this freeloader out and take a correspondence course.
How unprofessional jealousy can twist a man's mind.
I never thought old Bosley would sink that low.
With his influence he could turn the whole art world against poor Sam.
Ruin his reputation.
-We have got to help him.
-How?
We're gonna make him work, work, work till he reveals himself to the world as the true genius that he is.
Mr. Picasso.
Mr. Picasso.
-Dinner is served?
-Work.
Oh, senor.
Gosh, you going to ruin my appetite.
No, no, no.
As a starter we'll find something simple.
Let's see.
What'll it be?
Kitty!
Kitty!
Kitty!
You want me to work?
You're a genius, Picasso.
I won't permit you to waste your talent.
From now on you're going to paint, paint, paint.
But this is ridiculous.
I cannot be turned on like a kitchen faucet.
You must, old boy.
You owe it to posterity.
Please, I owe enough already.
Senor Gomez, believe me, I cannot paint a stroke without brushes made from goats' hair from Tibet.
Perfect.
I'll write my friend, the high lama.
He'll send us all the goats we need.
And what about the canvas?
You do not know, of course not, that I use canvasses made from Egyptian cotton.
I'll have the family helicopter pick some up on the way back from Tibet.
It's still no good.
I cannot paint in a living room.
-No.
-No!
-No.
-No!
-We fixed up a special studio just for you.
-Thank you.
Come on.
Voila!
You can work here without any distraction.
Won't you believe me?
I love distractions.
Mr. Picasso, we'll have all your meals sent in.
-Senor, but where will I sleep?
-Sleep, you say?
This one.
This is an instrument of torture.
Nonsense, Mr. Picasso.
Great art is born of great suffering.
This should bring something precious out of you.
Blood.
-That's the spirit, old boy.
Carry on.
-But If you want anything, just shriek.
Let me out of here.
Please.
Please help.
Help!
Now, now, Mr. Picasso, mustn't be lazy.
Back to your easel and just paint, paint, paint.
-How's Michelangelo doing?
-He's getting comfortable.
We're gonna make a great artist out of him if it kills him.
Hey, that's a good idea.
You know, no artist is famous until his death.
Maybe we could arrange it.
MORTlClA: No, I don't think we should, Uncle Fester.
We want Mr. Picasso to suffer for his art, but dying is going a little too far.
Mr. Picasso, relaxing from your labors?
Isn't that sweet?
He and Cleopatra have found each other.
Don't get too close, old man, she's an ear nibbler.
Now, now, Cleopatra, this is no time for romance.
Mr. Picasso has work to do.
She nearly crushed me.
Quite a feather in your cap.
She's not usually so affectionate with strangers.
Now, Mr. Picasso, back to your studio.
Studio.
Come, old man.
You know you're just dying to get back to work.
Senor, please, don't use that word again.
Thank you.
Querida.
Here I am, Mr. Picasso.
Are you ready?
Por favor, Senor.
Give me time to write a letter to my poor little old mother.
You can do that later.
You'd better get me now while I'm in the mood to model.
You came here to model?
Well, sure.
I've modeled all of Gomez's Halloween pumpkins.
He's quite a talented pumpkin carver.
Well, I'm sorry, sir.
You see, I only paint apples.
Darn.
No use, Lurch.
He's only painting apples.
Lunch.
Nice big boy, maybe we can make a deal?
-Deal?
-To get me out of here.
-Where did you come from?
-Pugsley's tunnel.
He has them all over the place.
Of course.
What is a home without a secret tunnel?
I came to watch you paint.
-You like to paint, eh, Wednesday?
-Sure, painting's fun.
-Watch.
-Yes.
-Yeah?
-You like, Mr. Picasso?
Oh, that's gorgeous, yes.
By next year you will be a good Grandma Moses.
Hey, wait a minute.
You said something about a tunnel, no?
Pugsley's a great tunneler.
Some people think he's part gopher.
Could be, could be.
Why not?
Tell me.
-Where does your secret tunnel lead to?
-Just outside.
Just outside?
Oh, you're right!
I'm going to take a stroll just outside.
Can I paint while you're gone?
To your heart's content.
-Kitty won't hurt you.
-No?
She once ate a zookeeper and got a upset stomach.
So -She's very careful now.
-How did you know?
A little birdie, a little birdie.
A little vulture told me so.
Well, you wish me luck, eh?
And you paint.
You paint any time you want.
There.
It's finished.
That's a beautiful vase, Uncle Fester.
That's not a vase, Gomez.
That's an urn for Grandfather Malaprop.
How thoughtful.
He is getting on.
What have we here?
-Why, it's Mr. Picasso.
-Where did you find him, Lurch?
Sneaking through the henbane.
Now, Mr. Picasso, we can't get our work done playing in the henbane, can we?
You know what we're going to have to do now.
Back to the pit.
Penniless, her little fingers bleeding from the tuna cans, she may return and say she's sorry.
Why, Mr. Picasso!
You have been busy.
What sophistication, throwing these masterpieces around as though they were confetti.
Superb.
I knew if we worked hard we'd get it out of you.
I have seen better things gotten out of a man with a scalpel.
True genius.
Never satisfied.
Look, now that you got this out of me, can I get out of here?
Nonsense, Mr. Picasso.
Not until we have our expert, Bosley Swain, look at your work.
Senora, can I leave before you show to Mr. Bosley Swain?
Certainly not.
It's so rare for an artist to be present at his own personal triumph.
Old man, this will be your finest hour.
Or my last.
Well, Bosley, what do you say now?
Incredible.
I didn't think you were capable of anything like this.
You hit me and I will report you to the Spanish consul.
Hit you.
I want to congratulate you.
-You mean to say you like them?
-They're masterpieces!
What childlike simplicity.
And what unique subject matter.
Trees with human heads.
I told you he was great, Bosley.
All he needed was the Addams influence to bring it out.
Just think, someday they may put a plaque in the front of our house saying, "Sam Picasso slept here".
Who slept?
Sam, I am buying all of them.
And I'll send my man to pick them up.
This is just the beginning, Picasso.
You can stay here and work as long as you like.
Oh, no.
I think I'll go back to Spain.
-Paint, paint, paint?
-No, fight bull fights.
Is much safer.
Adios, I think.
Adios, Picasso.
I tell you, querida, talent is contagious around here.
Why, you're another Mama.
Darling, thank you.
Tish, when you bow that way you drive me wild.
You mad Castilian.
-Mail's in.
-We've got all we need.
I think I'd better get it, dear.
Thank you, Thing.
I think it's from Mr. Picasso in Spain.
-Did he really go into fighting bulls?
-Oh, yes.
-Now he's back to painting them.
-Wonderful.
You know, darling, he was really a very good influence.
Not only on Grandmama and on me, but on Wednesday.
You know, she's started to paint exactly like him.
Superb.
Will you look at that?
Nothing like environment.

I'll give you another 1,000 watts.
HAPPY JOE ON RADlO: This is your broadcaster.
This Happy Joe in Tokyo.
-Fester, you've done it!
-Darling, introduce me to your friend.
Cemetery Kid to Happy Joe, I want you to say hello to my mother.
-Hello, My Mother.
-Hello, Happy Joe.
-Tell me something about your country.
-Not now.
Big earthquake coming.
Happy Joe gotta go.
Isn't that a pity?
Something ought to be done about those earthquakes.
Infernal nuisance.
I've got an SOS!
MAN ON RADlO: Flight 714 from Calcutta-Rangoon in trouble over the Bay ofBengal.
Any suggestions?
Tell him to dump the passengers.
Oh, no, he couldn't do that.
Of course not, darling, they'd get soaked.
Hello, Flight 714, this is Morticia Addams, and I have a helpful thought for you.
Oh, good girl.
Let's have it.
When the plane hits the water, have each passenger attend to his own luggage.
-lt'll avoid panic.
-Thanks awfully.
We're all right now.
Good.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Yes, sign off.
Fine gratitude.
Recognize it?
No, I don't Oh, how could I have missed that fine, sensitive, drooping chin?
-It's Uncle Flub.
-Right, my dear.
I caught him at that marvelous moment just before he starts to shake.
Wonder why we never hear from old Flubby anymore?
Simple, he can't write.
That reminds me, shouldn't the mail be in by now?
It will be.
Briggs.
You're not losing your nerve, are you, Briggs?
About going in there?
I always wanted to be an undercover man.
I'm glad, because you're the only one who can get in there without arousing suspicion.
Don't you worry about a thing, Mr. Hollister.
I've seen all the James Bond movies.
Good.
Say, are you sure you're on the right track?
The United States intelligence makes a point of never being too sure about anything.
All we know is that coded radio messages have been coming out of there like popcorn.
Coded radio messages?
Gee.
Like what?
Well, like dynamite toys, man-eating plants and roaring cats.
See if you can lay your hands on any writing.
Get a hold of some of their correspondence.
If I crack this case, maybe they'll make a movie about me.
They might even move you up to Parcel Post.
No mail?
What is it, Thing?
A joke?
Morticia, he's trying to tell us something.
Speak up, Thing.
And stop stuttering.
What is it?
Darling, he's trying to tell us there's someone at the front door.
You and Thing.
Such perfect understanding.
It's Mr. Briggs, our dear postman.
-I thought the postman always rings twice.
-You didn't even ring once.
Can I come in?
-Please do.
-Allow me.
Sorry our butler wasn't on hand to greet you.
He's up in the attic feeding the vultures.
Vultures?
They're here already?
-I better go.
-Mr. Briggs, you haven't even said hello.
Hello.
You've got to stay, Mr. Briggs.
-I do?
-Yes.
Well But l I do.
What I really came in for was to look through your mail.
I mean just the envelopes.
I have a little grandson who collects stamps from strange places, and you people sure get mail from the strangest -As a matter of fact, Hollister thinks -Hollister?
Yeah, Hollister.
That's my little grandson.
Say no more.
What little Hollister wants, little Hollister gets.
There you are.
Any of the stamps you like, just help yourself.
And if you wish, feel free to read the letters.
There's an interesting one here from China on the decline in the fortune cookie industry.
There's a lovely card from General Peron.
He's still looking for work.
- Mother!
-Yes, darling, coming.
If you want anything, we'll be in the code room.
-Code room?
-That's our new name for the playroom.
Darling?
Better watch that top letter, Briggs.
It's from my favorite witch doctor.
He's a tricky devil.
Code room.
I quit.
I don't wanna be an undercover man, I don't even wanna be a postman.
Easy, Briggs, easy.
The United States Government is a good thing to have on your side.
Not if they want me to stay at that spook house.
What happened?
You wouldn't believe it.
What about the correspondence?
The letters.
Look, I don't wanna see another letter as long as I live.
-You deliver them!
-Now, easy, Briggs, easy.
I've got to get someone sensible into that house.
Yeah, well, why don't you try Conkey, the plumber?
-Plumber?
-Yeah, he's a sensible one all right.
The Addams have been trying to get him for six months, and he won't go near the place.
The plumber, eh?
Thank you, Thing.
Hello?
Yes, this is Mrs. Addams.
Oh, well, thank you very much, we'll be looking forward to seeing you.
Goodbye.
Darling, that was Mr. Conkey, the plumber.
He's finally agreed to fix Kitty cat's drinking fountain.
High time.
He promised to do it six months ago.
Oh, come on, Conkey, what can happen?
I could get killed deader than a herring.
In that case, you'd be buried with full military honors.
Mr. Hollister, you make it sound so appealing.
Oh, no, now just a minute.
Look, with these walky-talkies, we'll be in constant contact.
Now if anything should happen, all you have to do is holler.
Yeah, if it's not too late.
Nothing like the minuet to strengthen the wrist.
Yes, it firms all those little wibbly-wobbles.
I guess that's all for now.
"lf girl get too firm, she turn to boy".
-Kipling.
-Confucius.
-There you are, Lurch.
-Take them to the kitchen, Lurch.
-Kitchen?
-Yes, for the shish kebab.
-I'll get it, my dear.
-Thank you, darling.
Shish kebab.
Lurch!
Lurch, don't forget the tenderizer.
Have it.
Morticia, he's here!
This is our plumber, Mr. Conkey.
Mr. Conkey, so good of you to come.
Without his drinking fountain, Kitty cat just isn't his old playful self.
-What's that?
-Oh, that's Kitty cat.
Roaring like that?
If your drinking fountain was broken, you'd roar, too.
-So long.
-Lurch, please take Mr. Conkey's hat.
Please, I don't think I got what I need for a job like this.
What's that?
Courage.
Oh, come now, Mr. Conkey, no silly excuses.
Come along.
It's the second tunnel to your left, Mr. Conkey.
Kitty cat's drinking fountain is just this side of the pit.
All right, Mr. Snoop.
Snoop?
No, I'm Mr. Conkey.
I'm only the plumber.
A likely story.
Get in that room.
Move.
Look what I found snooping around outside.
-He claims he's a plumber.
-But he is a plumber.
He's fixing Kitty cat's drinking fountain.
That's down in the basement.
What's he doing sneaking around up here?
That is a rather interesting question, Mr. Conkey.
What are you doing up here?
Well, I was just tracing the leak.
Conkey, there are no pipes in the playroom.
Playroom?
I thought I was in the attic.
Back to the basement, Mr. Conkey.
If that's your real name.
Come on.
Move it out.
So, you're a plumber, huh?
Well, let's see you plumb.
Morticia, wouldn't you say he's behaving rather strangely?
-Uncle Fester?
-Conkey.
Oh, yes, he is behaving very strangely.
Doesn't seem to know his attic from his basement.
Okay, Conkey.
Where are you now?
I'm back in the basement again.
Anything to report?
Just this.
If I get out of here alive, I'm never gonna complain about my union dues again.
Conkey?
-Don't do that.
-Where are you now?
How would I know?
I didn't build this spook house.
What are you gonna do next?
Sign off and pray.
- Querida.
-Here comes Mr. and Mrs. Weirdo.
Oh, yes.
Their lunch.
Poor Cleopatra, she must be famished.
I had no idea it was so late.
Time certainly flies when you're intellectually occupied.
Darling?
Gomez, what in the world could be the matter with her?
She won't eat.
She's in an absolute frenzy.
Perhaps you should call a vet.
For a plant?
No.
She's trying to tell us something.
Mr. Conkey?
What are you doing there?
What's that in your hand?
What's what?
What hand?
Is that a walky-talky?
Oh, this.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
This?
Yeah, yeah, this is a walky-talky.
And whom were you walky-talkying to?
Well, I was talking to Plumbing Central.
Sometimes you get into trouble and you need help.
And, boy, do I need help.
Plumbing Central?
Come in, Plumbing Central.
This is Conkey.
I need help.
Plumbing Central?
Conkey, have you flipped your wig?
Very busy.
Very busy down there.
Are they really?
Morticia, may I see you privately for a moment, please?
I'll go.
I'll go.
No, no, Mr. Conkey.
You stay right here and plumb.
He's behaving even more strangely than the mailman.
Yes.
He seems very flighty for a plumber.
If he is a plumber.
-Come in, Hollister, this is Conkey.
- Conkey, where are you now?
I'm bailing out.
You can't leave now.
You gotta stay.
I'm staying.
I'm staying.
I hate to bother you, old man, but there's something we have to check on.
Yes.
We don't mean to be rude, but could we see your union card?
I still think you should have thrown him out.
How could we?
His union card was above reproach.
Morticia, I don't feel safe with a nut like that running around the house.
Forget the plumber.
I've got to get through to Winthrop in Sumbawanga.
-Darling, is it so urgent?
-Absolutely.
I must tell him not to mix the plutonium with the uranium shipments.
Otherwise they'll never get here.
Boy, that'd really knock the coconuts off the trees.
Fester, you've got to give me more power.
I'll try.
Addams calling Winthrop.
Addams calling Winthrop.
Conkey calling Hollister.
Conkey calling Hollister.
Darling, you're on a party line.
HOLLISTER ON RADlO: This is Hollister.
Come in.
Hollister, I need help.
Lots of help!
Isn't that nice?
Mr. Conkey's finally contacted Plumbing Central.
Conkey calling Hollister.
Come in, Hollister.
For God's sake, come in.
I read you, Conkey.
I read you.
Don't read me.
Just get me out of here.
There's a lion in here!
Now stop fooling around, Conkey.
Your job is to find that communication center.
My job is to find a way out of here.
I got a secret door.
Well, go in then.
Go in.
Say, Conkey.
Maybe it's the radio room.
That's right.
It is.
Conkey, just what are you doing?
I'm leaving.
Morticia, there's skullduggery going on in this house.
That's right.
You're letting all kinds of kooks in here.
Darling, with your vast international interests, we can't afford to be too careful.
I think we should call the authorities.
Good thinking, my dear.
This is a job for lntelligence.
Well, don't look at me.
I got to go get recharged.
I have it.
I'll call the CIO.
Querida mia, not the CIO, ClA.
Whatever you say, dear.
I'll call Washington.
They'll put us in touch with the proper authorities.
Very good thinking, dear.
Intrigue.
Very intriguing.
Well, you did your best, Conkey.
Thanks anyway.
Well, who pays the bill?
18 bucks?
And one pair of lion-bit pants.
What are they saying, Morticia?
I spoke to the headman in Washington, who put me in touch with the regional director, who then put me in touch with the local director, who is now trying to connect me to the special agent in the field.
You start at the top, you get action.
I wouldn't worry about your breeches, Conkey.
The government's good for them.
Excuse me.
Yes?
Who?
Mrs. Addams.
Some strange things have been going on in this house.
And we feel you ought to know about them.
Dear Special Agent, of course we're ready to talk.
Now just don't move a muscle, Mrs. Addams, I'll be right in.
Over.
Conkey, I don't know what you did, but they are ready to confess.
Well, in case you need anything, Conkey Plumbing is out of business.
Follow me.
Badge Number 13.
What a lovely coincidence.
The same number as my perfume.
-Perfume?
-Yes.
Quagmire Number 13.
Mrs. Addams, I don't think you quite realize the serious situation that you're in.
Oh, but I do.
That's why we sent for you.
Naturally.
Of course, we don't like to implicate other people.
Then you do admit there are other people involved?
Of course.
Let's see.
There is Briggs, the postman.
And Mr. Conkey, the plumber.
Oh, please, Mrs. Addams, I planted those people here myself.
You did?
Then you must be involved in the ring.
I'd say he's the head of the ring.
-I'm gonna have to make a citizen's arrest.
-What do you mean, darling?
What if he isn't a citizen?
Now, look here.
Of course I'm a citizen.
Good.
Then it's legal.
You rang?
Lurch, disarm this traitor and throw him in the lockup.
Mrs. Addams, I appeal to you.
This is no time Here!
Just a minute.
I work for the government.
Hey, kid, get me out of here, will you?
I can't.
My father said you're to stay right there.
Look, would you get me out if I gave you a pair of genuine undercover man's handcuffs?
No.
I already got a pair from a regular cop that was here once.
Oh, it's time for me to send a message.
Calling Anthony in Poland.
This is Cleopatra, the man-eating plant.
The Thing is ready.
Repeat.
The Thing is ready.
Darn it.
The set's gone dead.
Do you mean to say that you're the one who's been making all these mystery calls?
When we grow up we're all going to meet in Bulgaria and fight the gypsies from outer space.
Oh, my God.
The chief will never believe this.
Well, old man.
We owe you an apology.
Yes, we called Washington and we found out you really are an undercover man.
-I am?
-Of course you are.
Buck up, old man.
There's lots of work to be done.
MORTlClA: Of course there is.
If it weren't for people like you, what would happen to people like us?
I don't know.
But why didn't it happen before I got here?
Do have Lurch give you back your pistol.
See, my dear.
These old heirlooms come in handy.
They certainly do, darling.
Why, do you know three years ago, I almost gave this away to the Salvation Army?
Darn nice of Ahmed Ben Pasha to send us this Turkish hookah.
Does wonders for togetherness.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
There's 20 cents postage due.
I wonder why Mr. Briggs didn't come in and get his money?
He never does anymore.
We must owe that man a fortune.
I notice it's from a rest home.
It says, "Thank you.
If it weren't for you people, I wouldn't be here".
It's signed P.J. Hollister.
I like a man who isn't too proud to be grateful.
Yes.
And it does make you thankful that our government men are so clever.
Dear Mr. Hollister.
We should send him something.
I have it.
Some of Mama's candied porcupine.
The simple things are the best.

Okay.
My dear.
Pull!
Ole, Ole!
I give up, querida mía.
I simply haven't the dexterity to squeeze off shots like that.
Now isn't this better than shooting apples off of Lurch's head?
Much safer and less expensive.
These poor steel-tipped arrows haven't a chance against Lurch's head.
Incidentally, darling, does Lurch seem troubled to you?
I spoke to him a few moments ago and he didn't even answer me.
Didn't act like he heard me.
- Do you suppose he's ill?
- I don't know.
He's been terribly depressed ever since he got that letter from his mother this morning.
Not himself at all.
- How could you tell?
- He smiled.
Something has given him a bad turn.
We should find him and get to the root of it.
More.
More.
Oh, gosh, Lurch, give me a turn.
You've been having all the fun.
Lurch, you're relaxing.
That's a relief.
We were worried about you.
He says the rack is the only thing that helps him forget his troubles.
Well, it'll do it every time, but you do have a problem, eh, old man?
Now, it's not that bad.
Come on, we'll get you off the rack and we'll talk about it.
Mama, Uncle Fester's fixing a tasty new dish.
Why don't you run along, maybe he'll share it with you.
I could stand a snack.
Selfish!
Come on, old man.
Speak up.
Now, Lurch, does it have anything to do with the letter you received from your mother this morning?
Why, I should think you'd be pleased that she's going to visit.
We'd love to have her stay with us.
We could put her up in that nice attic room.
- No.
- No?
I fibbed.
To your mama?
Well, Mr. Addams and I understand.
We understand about those little white lies that a roaming son writes his mother.
Lurch, that picture of the house that you sent to your mother, you told her it was your house, right?
Well, we always think of you as one of the family, Lurch.
- A servant.
- A very good servant.
- I'm a liar.
- And a very good liar.
- Gomez!
- Oh, sorry, I got carried away.
Now don't you fret about a thing.
We'll put our heads together and see what we can do to help you.
We'll call a family conference.
Maybe Uncle Fester can think of something.
He has a good head on his shoulders.
Too bad Cousin Slimy isn't around.
He has two of them.
I say let's mine the front porch.
I can wire it so it'll blow up when she pushes the doorbell.
That always discourages those magazine salesmen.
Not bad, Fester, but why not just wire the doorbell with a few thousand volts?
No need to damage the porch.
No, no, darling, that wouldn't be kind.
You let her get all the way to the door and then disappoint her like that.
- Why not have Lurch play dead?
- Good thinking.
You think Lurch could be convincing?
He looks so alive.
It was a very sweet thought, darling, but that's true.
Lurch is so vivacious.
His most outstanding characteristic.
I have it.
If Mrs. Lurch thinks that Lurch is a very important, big man and owns this house and everything, why don't we just let her continue to think so?
Querida mía.
Leave it to you, with your feminine intuition, - to come up with the correct answer.
- Darling.
Tish, when you pat my cheek it drives me wild.
You Castilians are so fiery.
Yes, Cousin Manuelo was a pyromaniac.
Darling, later, later.
Let's concentrate on Lurch.
Oh, yes.
- Now - Forgive me.
for the few days that Mrs. Lurch is here, we'll let her think that Lurch is the head of the household, - and we'll be the servants.
- Marvelous.
Do you think I'd make a convincing butler?
Darling, I couldn't imagine a subtler butler.
You'll completely captivate Mrs. Lurch with your savoir-faire.
Tish, when you speak French, you know how it affects me.
Later, mon cher, later, not now.
We have to get this thing settled.
Now, I'll be the maid and Mama will be the cook.
- I will not!
- Mama.
My schoolgirl complexion may have graduated, but I'm not gonna get dish-pan hands for anyone.
I'll stay in the cottage till that woman leaves.
Excellent idea, Mama, and you can take the children with you.
Oh, that's a very good idea, dear.
Now, Uncle Fester, - you can be the gardener.
- Forget it.
But, Uncle Fester, wouldn't you like to potter around in the back yard, maybe plant some crabgrass or stickweed?
I like the back yard just the way it is.
Bare.
I'm gonna move out in the cottage with the others.
Well, I guess it'll just have to be the two of us.
Darling, we can do it.
Let's go tell Lurch and rehearse our roles.
There you are, madam.
Are you ready for your soup now, sir?
Cara bella!
Oh, Morticia, you're enchanting.
Thank you, kind sir.
Darling, you make a superb butler.
It gives full play to your courtly Castilian manner.
Oh, Tish, you ravishing creature.
Darling, now, remember our new positions.
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
- Is Lurch ready for his first lesson?
- Yes, he's in the living room now.
Now, remember, darling, one ring is for you, two rings for me.
Yeah.
That's me.
- You rang?
- You rang?
No, no, Lurch.
You rang.
Oh, no, sir.
You rang for me because I'm your butler.
And I'm not "sir," I'm Gomez.
- Now sit down.
- Yes, sir.
Gomez.
Perhaps this will help.
A cigar gives a man that masterful feeling.
Have you ever smoked?
You got a couple of bad leaks there, old man.
- You better forget the cigars.
- It's no use.
You can do it, Lurch.
Just concentrate.
Think big.
Think important.
Think that you are master of all you survey.
Think.
That's it.
Splendid, Lurch.
You got it.
Now ring for the maid and demand your breakfast.
You rang?
- Telephone, Gomez.
- Yes, sir.
I'll get it, sir.
Please, Lurch.
I answer the phone.
Your evening paper, sir.
No, no, Lurch, not the funnies.
The financial page.
Wealthy men always turn to the financial page first.
I like the funnies.
Very good, Lurch.
You actually sounded masterful then.
Now, as far as pinching the maid Perhaps that would be carrying it a bit too far.
But I don't want your mother to become suspicious.
Perhaps you'd better just make eyes at me instead.
Try it, Lurch.
Lurch, as mistress of this house, I'm ordering you to make eyes at me.
Perhaps you'd better just try a devilish smile.
Forget it, Lurch.
I'm just not your type.
- Your Cognac, sir.
- I never drink.
Nonsense.
Gentlemen of quality always have a brandy after dinner.
It's a sign of sophistication and culture.
Well, he just flunked sophistication.
- Morticia.
- Darling, what do you think?
Cousin Imar asked me to sew in his college seal.
Princeton.
Beautiful.
Morticia, we've done it.
Lurch just ordered me to shine his shoes.
That's wonderful.
He even reprimanded me this morning.
He said his toast wasn't black enough.
He's completely brainwashed.
The doorbell.
That may be his mama now.
- It's Mama.
- All right.
Now you let me open the door properly, Lurch.
You greet her right here.
- How do you do?
- Where's my boy?
- There you are!
Sonny.
- Mama.
There she goes again.
That's me.
Two rings.
That's me.
Three blasts.
It's an all-out command performance this time.
Let's wait till she makes up her mind.
Sonny, I don't know how you put up with such miserable servants.
They're never around when you want them.
She really is a little cyclone.
Not at all what I expected Lurch's mother to be like.
I haven't sat down since she got here.
What is it, darling?
I'm all kinked up from last night, sleeping on the divan.
I miss our nice, big bed.
Well, I suppose she was right in saying that Lurch should have the master bedroom.
After all, she does think he's the master of the house.
Well, at least you slept on Lurch's bed in the attic.
She's really quite insensitive for such a dear little thing.
Do you know she hates Pugsley's octopus?
Anyone who'd hate an octopus is warped.
She even tried to feed it to Cleopatra.
That's inhuman.
I rescued them just in time.
Let's call off this whole mad charade.
Oh, darling, please be patient.
It's only for a few more days.
You'd better go to her now before she rings the house down.
Oh, Tish, when you help me with my coat it goes right through me.
- It's impossible.
- What's impossible?
That blondes have more fun.
You rang?
I don't trust you, Gomez, you've got shifty eyes and no good butler wears a moustache.
Sorry, madam, I was born with it.
Where have you been off to?
Some dark corner with that hussy of a maid?
Sir, I appeal to you.
You don't appeal to him and you don't appeal to me.
My son is just too sweet and gentle.
People take advantage of him.
You're sloppy and inefficient.
Sir, please tell her.
You're sloppy and inefficient.
Yes, sir.
I'll try to do better, sir.
- What kind of monstrosity is that?
- That's Thing, madam.
Well, set a trap for it.
Get it back in that box, nail the lid down.
Yes, madam.
Well, snap to it.
You're living on borrowed time around here.
Mama's going to stay until she gets things straightened out around this place.
Big, important men like her sonny are much too busy to be bothered running a household.
Yes, Mama.
Thing, I'm sorry I had to nail up your favorite box, but you don't realize the spot we're in.
Try to stay Try to stay undercover for the next couple of days, please.
Gomez, darling, I'm afraid we've made a terrible mistake.
Instead of pleasing Lurch's mother all we're doing is making her miserable.
Perhaps, but Lurch certainly is happy.
Do you know he's really beginning to believe that he owns this house?
And that we're his servants?
Just hold out for a couple of more days and everything will be back to normal.
- Darling, you're so noble and generous.
- That's true.
But, you're every bit as magnanimous, querida mía.
A-ha!
- Caught in the act!
- Madam, allow us to explain.
No need.
I can see the plot now.
You intend to wheedle Sonny into marriage.
Then you'll do away with him and marry this shameless witch.
- Then you'll both split his fortune.
- Nonsense.
- Gomez wouldn't harm a fly.
- I've read a lot of detective stories and the butler is always the one who does it.
Well, you can forget it all now.
I'm wise to both of you.
You know, the way things are going, her idea isn't bad.
Those people got to go.
I won't leave this house till I see you safely set up with decent help.
- Maybe a raise.
- A raise?
- They want all your money.
- They seemed so nice.
Yeah, well, you just call them in and give them their walking papers.
Just call them in and tell them they're fired.
- Now!
Quick!
Git!
- Yes, Mama.
- You rang, sir?
- You're fired.
You mean you're dismissing us?
You're fired.
Now pack your things and git!
Isn't it customary to give two-weeks notice?
Not to cutthroats and thieves.
On your way!
Scoot!
Lurch, do something.
- No, no, I mean, say something.
- Good luck.
- We'll pack our bags at once.
- And leave the silverware.
Good riddance.
And now I'll phone the Employment Agency, and get two good replacements right away.
Yes, Mama.
Why doesn't that woman go home?
I don't like living out here.
It's too crowded.
Maybe Morticia's man-eating plant will get her.
You're a dreamer.
I'll get it.
Well, here we are.
One big happy family again.
- Did she leave?
- We did.
We've been fired.
We'll just have to move in here with you until she goes home.
But that's ridiculous.
How can you get fired from your own home?
That's an interesting question.
We can't all live in here.
It's too crowded now, and that old spitfire will probably stay on for ages.
I won't give up my bed.
I just got the nails nicely broken in.
We really ought to buy another house.
Just for emergencies like this.
I said this whole idea was crazy.
You're both as soft as jellyfish.
Coddling a butler.
Oh, Uncle Fester, you should see how happy Lurch is.
Well, he should see how miserable we are.
I'm going right up to the house and straighten this whole mess out.
And I'll go with you.
- It takes a woman to handle a woman.
- Oh, please, Mama.
Please don't do anything to spoil it now that it's almost over.
Oh, don't worry.
She doesn't know us.
We'll tell her we're the next-door neighbors.
Yeah, we'll tell them what wonderful servants you are, that we've had our eye on you for years.
Yeah, that's a great idea.
And that we want you so much that she'll wanna hire you right back.
Gomez, do you really think she'll take us back?
If she does I'm gonna ask for a raise.
- Well, you're very prompt.
- Well, now look, Mrs. Lurch Well, please, come right in.
You can start at once.
- You don't seem to understand.
- Of course I understand.
You're the new butler and you're the new maid, and I must say you're just perfect.
- Oh, well, that's very kind of you - A real butler.
Such polish, such poise, such a continental manner.
I trust you completely.
Oh, well, that's very generous, you see, but - What's the salary?
- Anything you ask.
Price is no object when you demand quality.
- I'll take it.
- Just a minute.
Now, look, you do what you wanna do, but I'm back in a decent house and I'm getting paid for it.
I do hope you'll stay, too.
You're exactly the kind of maid my son needs.
A mature, sensible woman who won't be making eyes at him like the last one did.
Well, maybe I'll try it.
I haven't had a regular income for a long time.
Wonderful!
Now I can go back home.
I know my son is in good hands.
Well, goodbye, Sonny.
Goodbye, Mama.
Dear Lurch, you were just marvelous.
I'm sure your mother is very proud of you.
Nice work, old man, you brought it off splendidly.
Where are you two going?
It's all over now.
We're going back into the house.
I'm sorry.
Your positions have been filled.
Lurch, please stop playing.
But I love music.
Lurch, we're waiting for you to serve dinner.
Me?
Serve dinner?
Oh, Lurch, I thought we had you completely unbrainwashed.
Let's try it again.
- You rang?
- You rang?
Now I'm doing it again.
That was very good, Lurch.
Almost like your old self.
Thank you, Mrs. Addams.
Now would you please serve dinner?
Oh, the poor dear.
This has been a very harrowing experience for him but I do think he's his old self again.
Shall we go into dinner, cara bella?
Yes, darling.
Lurch.
You're fired.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Come on, Fester, get that power going.
I want this crash to be a real whopper.
I'm too excited to play trains, Gomez.
I should go up to my room and pack some things for the outing.
- But that's tomorrow.
- It's going to be real neat.
Exploring a brand-new cave.
And I'm gonna light the way for everybody.
Bright as Broadway.
Now, what'll it be today, Pugsley?
A nice head-on collision?
Couldn't we have a derailment for a change?
Derailment it is.
Let that current go, Fester.
I wanna see 'em fly off the tracks.
Gomez, don't you think I ought to save myself till tomorrow?
Tomorrow is another day.
Why didn't I think of that?
Okay.
Now watch this, Pugsley boy.
A wild pile-up on the next turn.
- Suddenly I went dead.
- You need recharging.
No, I just had that done this morning.
I didn't feel good all day, but I never thought it'd come to this.
What do we do, Father?
The only thing we can do.
Call an electrician.
- I think I have an emotional watt seepage.
- Watt a way to go.
- Don't make fun of me, Gomez.
- I'm sorry, really.
Hello?
Home Electrical?
I'd like to ask a bit of advice.
Our Uncle Fester seems to have got himself de-volted.
Hello?
You still there?
Good.
Yes, de-volted.
Well, you see, he was running an electric train and suddenly his power went off.
- What did he say?
- I can't tell you in front of the boy.
- I guess we'll have to talk to Morticia.
- Gee, I hate to worry her about me.
Well, it's not the worry.
She was going to bake a cake this afternoon and she wanted you to run her cake mixer.
Failure upon failure.
I feel like going out and drowning myself in the smog.
Breathe deeply.
It does wonders for your sinuses.
- Gomez!
- Well, it does.
Again.
Thank you, Thing.
But remember, nobody likes a smart thing.
Wednesday dear, that was lovely.
You're really improving.
I think you're almost ready to start on the new piece I bought you.
Dance of the Hyenas.
That sounds pretty.
Thank you, Lurch, that will be all.
- Mother.
Uncle Fester's sick.
- Are you sure?
When I saw him at breakfast this morning, his face fairly glowed with that lovely jaundiced color.
Maybe he blew a fuse.
Oh, darling, I'm sure he's funning you.
He probably wants you to put a penny behind his ear to make him go again.
I doubt that.
No, his malady is a bit of a mystery.
Children, why don't you go into the kitchen and help Grandmama sort the toadstools from the mushrooms.
She's going to make a lovely toadstool soufflé.
- Yummy!
- Yummy!
That reminds me, darling.
If you're going to bake that cake I'll have to run out and get you a hand mixer.
- Then Uncle Fester's really ill.
- Not a watt.
Oh, darling.
I'm afraid this will cancel our outing for tomorrow.
We could take flashlights.
But the light would be too harsh.
And too bright to explore new and unknown caves.
Besides, when Uncle Fester switches to neon, the effect is truly spectacular.
The children will be so disappointed.
Little Wednesday was looking forward to collecting some new spiders.
- You know how she adores her pets.
- I know how you were looking forward to some hemlock seedlings for your garden.
Darling, we're being very selfish.
We're thinking of ourselves, and we shouldn't.
We should only think of how to help Uncle Fester.
How like you to think of it that way, querida mía.
You are a gem.
Tasty one, too.
Darling, do you remember our second honeymoon at Niagara Falls?
- In Niagara Falls.
- It was a divine cave.
Free showers, anytime of the day or night.
That was living, mon ami.
Tish.
When you speak French you drive me wild.
Speak some more French, Tish.
Anything.
Tout á I'heure.
La plume de ma tante.
Mademoiselle from Armentieres.
Anything.
- You are a devil.
- Yes.
I'm just gonna pack my bags and leave.
Uncle Fester, what seems to be the trouble?
Mama called me an outing pooper.
- Oh, I'm sure she meant it kindly.
- Of course.
From Mama that's flattery.
And that's not all.
Thing refused to Indian wrestle with me.
And the piranha fish wouldn't even take a bite out of my hand.
That is unfriendly.
It's worse than that.
I asked Lurch to bring up my bed of nails so I could get some relaxation and he absolutely ignored me.
We'll see about that.
You rang?
Lurch, I'm afraid you're going to have to apologize to Uncle Fester.
That's better.
Dear Lurch, he expresses himself so well.
I don't blame anyone for rejecting me, the way I've ruined the family's outing.
Uncle Fester, Gomez and I aren't rejecting you.
- We want to help you.
- But the question is how?
I believe it has something to do with your diet.
Impossible.
I always eat a very simple, wholesome meal.
Now, for breakfast this morning I had walnut shells and sour milk.
Oh, you should have had green persimmons first.
Naturally.
Gosh.
If there is something wrong with me, I hope it's one of those rare tropical diseases.
You know, Morticia.
Something glamorous.
I hope so too, dear.
But in the meantime, we must get you well before tomorrow.
Oh, you better go along without me.
I'll probably be an outing pooper.
Well, back to the smog.
Poor Uncle Fester.
He sounds suicidal.
At least he'll go with a clear sinus.
Uncle Fester!
Don't try to discourage me, Morticia.
Uncle Fester, I've been thinking.
Have you been getting enough moonshine?
Morticia, you know I don't drink.
Morticia's referring to moonbathing.
The moon has marvelous restorative powers for us Addamses.
Provided you don't take too much of it.
There's a full moon out tonight.
If I get too much I get freckles.
Nonsense.
A good moonbath is just the tonic you need.
Well, I don't know about Uncle Fester, but you've talked me into one.
Catch.
You little minx.
- Isn't this fun, Fester?
- Oh, yes.
But I'm not out here for fun.
I'm out here to get my health back.
I'd watch myself with that reflector the first time around.
You should work up gradually to a nice coat of grey.
Very wise, darling.
Uncle Fester, would you like some of Mama's goose grease?
Well, I had some.
It was delicious.
Uncle Fester, you're not supposed to eat it.
- You're supposed to rub it on you.
- Oh?
Maybe that's why I don't feel any better.
Oh, now on top of everything I've got myself a severe moonburn.
Shucks.
Oh, Gomez, you were a handsome little boy.
- Darling, that's our son Pugsley.
- Oh?
You're right, I thought he looked familiar.
Hello, Uncle Fester.
You still alive?
- Well, don't I look it?
- Of course, darling.
That moonbath did wonders for you.
Don't let this outdoorsy, athletic exterior fool you.
I feel rotten.
Thing doesn't look so hot, either.
He couldn't get past threesies four times in a row.
I think there is something wrong with him.
Thing, are you all right?
Gomez, this is becoming serious.
I think there maybe something contagious going around.
You may be right.
We'd better check Zelda.
Zelda, dear, are you all right?
She sounds fine.
Gomez, isn't that sweet?
She's molting.
Beautiful.
Zelda, darling, you're not eating your lunch.
Dear, there is something wrong.
She's not eating, and that's her favorite dish.
Dry bones.
Wouldn't eat her dried bones.
This is serious.
There's only one solution.
We've got to call a doctor.
A doctor?
Which one?
The only one.
Our family witch doctor, Dr. Mbogo.
Who did you want again?
Oh, Dr. Mbogo.
Wait a minute.
I'll see if I can get a hold of him.
Hold on.
Tish, remind me to get myself a hollow log.
Save a lot of time by dialing direct.
They are taking a long time getting through, aren't they?
Yes.
Well, he's probably got a hut full of patients.
Give old Doc a good tsetse fly bite case and he can't tear himself away.
Hello?
Doctor?
Gomez Addams here.
Jambo to you too, Doctor.
Doctor, we're having a spot of trouble with Uncle Fester, and we'd appreciate it if you Really?
Business is that good, eh?
Well, if that's the way it is.
Goodbye.
What's the matter, dear?
Dr. Mbogo isn't making any more house calls.
Well, we're right back where we started from.
Well, now what in the world are we going to do?
I should've engaged that Pygmy witch doctor when I had the chance.
He was reliable.
Besides, he could travel for half fare.
This really cancels our outing, doesn't it, Gomez?
Well You mean I won't get to catch any spiders?
I need some new ones.
I know, darling.
But we will go someday.
After all, Uncle Fester isn't feeling well.
I'm an outing pooper.
There's only one thing left for us to do.
Tish, remember, please.
Nothing rash.
But I'm afraid the situation calls for it, dear.
We'll have to call a regular doctor.
Why, thank you, Thing.
You're still very efficient.
Darling, would you mind handing me the phone, please?
- Certainly, my dear.
- Thank you.
I'll get it.
- Dr. Milford.
- This is Mrs. Addams.
Addams.
Yes.
We have the house across the street and down the block from you.
No, that's not empty.
That's us.
We call it our honeymoon cottage.
Oh, yes, Mrs. Addams.
Now I get you.
What can I do for you?
A member of our family is feeling a bit under and we wondered if you could stop by today?
I'd be glad to.
Thank you.
Goodbye.
You think we did the right thing?
Darling, if this doctor proves inadequate, we'll send out West for a medicine man.
Hello.
Hello, little girl.
This is the Addams house, isn't it?
Are you the doctor that's going to cure Uncle Fester?
Well, I'm certainly going to try my best.
Where's your mask and spear?
My what?
The last doctor we had came like that.
Yes, well This was the best I could do on the spur of the moment.
I hope you can cure Uncle Fester.
He can't even make the trains go.
Trains?
We haven't had a good wreck all day.
So that's what a family doctor looks like.
He certainly doesn't inspire confidence.
Not like Dr. Mbogo.
And I'm afraid I won't be able to settle his fee for a few painted beads, either.
What's that little black bag he's carrying?
I don't know, dear.
But I'm sure, because it's black, it's something to help you.
I don't think I'm gonna like him.
The white hair and those glasses.
How un-medical can he get?
Dr. Milford.
How do you do, Doctor?
This is my lovely bride, Morticia.
And this is our patient, Uncle Fester.
I feel fine.
Go away.
I'm not going to harm you.
I don't like quacks.
You'll have to forgive him.
He's used to our old family doctor.
But he's busy with his tribe.
Oh.
Wonderful doctor.
Cured my pneumonia by dousing me with kerosene and pouring ashes over my head.
Sometimes the old-fashioned remedies are best.
Well, Doctor, would you like Mrs. Addams and me to leave?
You're not gonna leave me alone with him.
No.
That won't be necessary.
Not for the moment, at least.
All right.
Make yourself comfortable.
Doctor Now if you'll just take off your coat, I can start my examination.
I never take my coat off.
I just couldn't.
He's really very modest.
Well, all right.
I'll try and work around it.
Sit right here, please.
Fester.
Right.
My dear.
Now open your mouth and say "ah".
This is most unusual.
Your tongue is bright blue.
Blue?
It's supposed to be green.
I am sick.
Don't worry, old boy.
We'll pull you through.
Just think about how nice it's going to be tomorrow this time.
That's the only thing that's keeping me going.
Hoping little Wednesday gets some nice Black Widows.
Most unusual.
Most unusual.
Well, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to take one arm out of your coat for this test.
- Never!
- But No!
Very well.
I'll try it over your sleeve.
Most unusual.
I daresay I'll have a paper for the medical journal from this one.
Interesting patient, isn't he, Doctor?
Unbelievable.
He does have some unusual methods, doesn't he?
Yes, indeed.
I wish he'd shake his rattles or yell a few times as Dr. Mbogo does.
Makes you feel like he's accomplishing something.
Will you open the front of your coat, please?
Of course not.
Not in front of Morticia.
I'll look the other way, Uncle Fester.
Very well.
What is it, Doctor?
Don't spare us.
What do you think?
I think I'd better forget the medical journal.
Contact Believe It or Not.
I'd better take your temperature.
I took his pulse just before you got here.
And?
Well, either my watch has stopped or he's been dead for 20 minutes.
He exaggerates so.
I'm not so sure.
Three below zero?
By Jove, he's broken the family record.
No wonder I felt a little bit chilly.
I'd better close the windows.
No, no, no, that can't be right.
I'd better take another reading.
It's very tasty.
What have you done?
I was so hungry Poor dear hasn't touched a thing all day.
Even when he does eat he can't resist those between-meal snacks.
May I use your phone?
I'll have to alert the emergency hospital.
Hey, Doc, you got another one of those things?
Really hits the spot.
The thermometer?
Do you realize you've swallowed almost a full ounce of mercury?
Well, it's a real picker-upper.
Now he's beginning to look like his old self again.
He is?
Dr. Milford, you're a genius, an absolute genius.
- I am?
- I could kiss you.
- Please.
- That was a real medical coup.
Pure mercury with Well, some of medical science's greatest discoveries have come about by accident.
- Accident.
Isn't he the modest one?
- Yes.
Doctor, before you go, we have one other patient we'd like for you to look at.
Thing hasn't been feeling well at all lately.
- Thing?
- Yes.
I'm all out of thermometers.
Oh, you won't need a thermometer for Thing.
This way.
Thing, we have a surprise for you.
Dr. Milford has cured Uncle Fester and now he wants to have a look at you.
- What's the matter with him?
- Maybe he caught what you had.
Nonsense.
He probably just remembered an appointment he has.
Well, he won't be able to do much without his little black bag.
Hey, these are tasty.
You know, calling a family doctor is like having your own delicatessen.
I suppose that lets out Dr. Mbogo.
It certainly does.
Unless it's something really serious.
Darling, isn't it wonderful that Thing wasn't really sick?
Just depressed over our having to cancel our outing.
Quite so, cara mía.
Thing always has the family's interests at heart.
Back to your usual jolly yourself again, eh, Thing?
Looks like you're planning something special for us, Uncle Fester.
This will be the greatest family outing we've ever had.
Watch.
Bravo!
Bravo, Uncle Fester.
You've really outdone yourself this time.
From now on, Uncle Fester, no more Christmas trees.
We'll hang everything on you.

They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Querida mía.
Such grace, such beauty.
For you I die happily.
Uncle Fester doesn't seem to be very much impressed.
Same old humdrum.
Nothing new ever happens around here.
Oh, come, Uncle Fester.
Cousin Nanook sent us that lovely new totem pole for Christmas.
And he asked for our bear in return.
He's a real Eskimo giver.
Would you like to take the vulture for a little stroll?
- She seems to take to humans.
- Her favorite food.
I think I need a change.
A trip, maybe.
Oh, I think that's a very good idea.
Don't you, Gomez?
I do indeed.
It's been a long time since we've had a family outing.
Will you ever forget the fun we had on that picnic?
What a lovely spot for a picnic.
Devil's Island.
There must be some How about the tar pits?
Now, Uncle Fester, every time we go near those tar pits, you go wild.
It is a fun place, isn't it?
What's new?
What is new?
I suppose Death Valley has been overrun with tourists since we first discovered it.
Yes, darling.
Listen, why don't we go to Quanta La Gustra?
Quanta La Gustra?
Darling, that's the innkeeper's name.
Oh?
Oh, how disappointing.
It did sound romantic.
It's a problem.
We've been most everywhere.
We've never been to the moon.
That's true, we haven't.
It would be beguiling to be on the moon with you, cara mia.
Especially if we landed on the dark side.
Darling.
But isn't that a bit far to go for a holiday trip?
Well, we wouldn't run into the same old faces.
That's true.
- It could be rather costly.
- All we need is a spaceship.
We could go to the playroom and find out to the penny.
All we have to do is consult the computer that Pugsley and I built.
Yeah, Wizzo knows everything.
Even told me how to cure my baldness.
- Is it working?
- No, but it cured my cough.
Darling, shall we?
It's such a comfort to have a machine do our thinking for us.
Wizzo is a highly scientific instrument, Uncle Fester.
It deals in facts.
You have to feed it specific, accurate data.
Like this.
End result desired.
Cost of manned flight to the moon.
Elements.
Load.
Thrust.
Orbit.
Act achieved.
Plus.
Well expected.
Ampersand.
Tuner.
Silencer cap.
- What's he saying?
- Wizzo only knows, dear.
That horn stopper.
Half mile prep ratio.
Mark up.
"S".
Plus.
Seeing to the launching pad.
And coffee to your milk in-flight.
It goes double first cabin all the way.
- Hey, it's gonna blow up!
- No, no, dear.
Wizzo's just thinking.
He sure thinks loud.
The computer is carefully digesting all pertinent data.
That's the sound of success.
Our answer on the cost of rocketing to the moon will soon be here.
Thank you, dear.
Knows its manners.
Darling, this isn't too expensive.
It's just $21.13 over a billion.
It's a shade more than I expected.
Oh, I'll do my part.
I'll come up with the $21.13.
As a matter of fact, I don't even know how much I have on hand right now.
Since I put all my finances in Mr. Hulen's hands, he's been handling everything.
A vacation trip to the moon?
Oh, it does sound enchanting, doesn't it?
I can hardly wait to capture it all on canvas.
How do you like my moon hat?
Wait till Hedda Hopper gets a load of this.
- Well, it's all settled.
- No, it is not settled.
Do you realize what it would cost to send a spaceship to the moon?
Well, of course.
We don't just jump into these things, you know.
Here is a feature story in today's paper about the cost to our country of their space program.
Read it.
Wow!
"Daily double pays $17,000".
No, no, not that.
This.
Read it.
It's there in black and white.
Billions!
Oh dear, perhaps we are being a bit extravagant.
You may be right, querida.
Well, we can do without the limousine and the forensicaffer.
- What's a forensicaffer, dear?
- Who knows?
Hey.
Did you know Little Orphan Annie's got no eyeballs?
That's part of her charm.
Will you please stick to the issue?
All this moon talk is absolutely absurd.
Now hold on there, Mr. Hulen.
My own personal computer claims that a trip to the moon would cost only one billion, Yeah, and I'm putting up the $21.13.
He just insists on doing his share.
Oh, well, that's just dandy.
But you're a trifle short on that billion.
- What's a trifle?
- This happens to be a very big trifle.
There must be some way to pick up that kind of money.
I've got it.
We'll invent something that costs a dime to make, sells for a dollar, and is habit-forming.
No, I don't think so, dear.
Habit-forming is a bad habit.
Well, now we're getting somewhere.
If you get any other bright schemes - Hey, wait a minute.
- Please, please.
I've had a very trying day.
Now look, that daily double thing paid $17,000 on only two winning horses.
Nice yield.
Now, what will happen if we pick eight winners every day, for, say, a whole month?
How much would that be?
- Way over a billion.
- Over?
Good.
Then you wouldn't need my $21.13.
Will you please forget this moon business?
I tell you, it's impractical, imprudent and absolutely impossible.
Mr. Hulen, are you trying to discourage us?
I certainly am.
Don't beat around the bush.
Just answer yes or no.
Look, it's tough enough to hit a daily double.
To pick eight winners in a row is almost impossible.
But to pick them for 30 days is utterly preposterous.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
What a challenge.
Dear Gomez, he has an absolute flair for failure.
Well, he's a cinch.
Nobody could even begin to pick that many winners.
- Wizzo could.
- Why, of course.
Wizzo.
Why, he could do it with 20 watts tied behind his back.
We could put the money to wonderful use.
Build a haven for Ionely and unwanted bats.
Help preserve our beautiful swamplands.
Endow a University chair in witchcraft and other fine arts.
That's all very uplifting, of course.
But it's still gambling.
This is no time for negativism, old boy.
As soon as Wizzo picks the right horses, you'll get out to the track and start the ball rolling.
You couldn't catch me putting $2 on any horse anytime.
$2?
That's buzzardfeed.
How about $2,000?
As a starter.
$2,000?
In other words, darling, you take the money that we win on the first race and then bet it on the second.
Is that the plan, dear?
- Exactly.
- Very clever, mon cher.
Oh, Tish, that French.
It goes right through me.
- Speak some more.
- Darling, we have company.
Just a few words.
Soup du jour.
Inky dinky parlez- vous.
Moulin Rouge.
Anything.
Very well, darling.
L 'amour, toujours I'amour.
Thank you, Tish.
That was beautiful.
Now where were we?
- We were winning a lot of money.
- Oh, yes!
We bet with Wizzo, and one month hence we'll have an extra billion to knick and knack around with.
Let's see.
I seem to recall having an extra couple of thousand to bet with kicking around here somewhere.
Yes.
Thank you, Thing.
Here we are, Mr. Hulen.
$2,000.
Not only cold cash but a little moldy, too.
Well, you seem quite intent upon following through with this madness.
Nevertheless, I would like to leave you with these few words, "Gambling is the disease of barbarians".
Shakespeare.
"It's the vice of knaves and fools".
Benjamin Franklin.
And, "This whole scheme is absolutely nutty".
Ralph J. Hulen.
What a scholar.
How fortunate to have him as our investment counselor.
And bookie.
Darling, a glove for Thing.
No, dear.
It's a sweater for Pugsley's octopus.
Yes, sir.
Oh, Mr. Hulen, you just missed a call from Mr. Addams.
That is the best thing that's happened all day.
With a list of the horses a Mr. Wizzo seems to have picked.
So, since you'll be at the track all day, I'll just Their money is going to stay right in my pocket.
And when that first horse loses, they're going to be grateful to me that I didn't throw it away.
- But Mr. Hulen, the first four races - This firm does not gamble.
We're a sound, conservative investment institution.
Yes, Mr. Hulen.
But, sir, perhaps you'd better just check the races on the radio.
Just to be sure.
- It's a waste of time.
- Please, Mr. Hulen.
All right.
The fifth race should be on.
They've picked Nellie Bee.
ANNOUNCER ON  It was a driving finish, and the winner is Nellie Bee with English Gal second in the race.
That's five straight.
- Five straight?
- Oh, yes.
If you'd thrown away their money, they'd now be winning $480,000.
Give me an aspirin.
Kind of felt you'd be asking for one.
If Wise Guy wins the next race, we'll owe them $2,850,000.
- Who asked you?
- But Well, I'll just have to go to the Addamses, apologize, and then tell them I didn't place their bets.
What if they won't accept your apology?
What if they demand their money?
- What then?
- Simple.
I'll shoot myself.
Coming down to the line of finish now, it's Oh For The Boy and Fleet O' Foot.
Come on, Fleet O' Foot.
Fleet O' Foot is going to the front by a head.
Now a neck, and it's Fleet O' Foot, the winner by a furlong.
He did it.
Good old Fleet O' Foot!
I I need a drink.
- Isn't this marvelous?
- How much have we won?
Prices on the sixth race.
Fleet O' Foot paid $6 to win, $4.40 to place.
and $2.80 to show.
That means we now have Mr. Hulen!
You look really happy for us.
Mr. Hulen, just think, we've already won over $7 million.
There must be some mistake.
Oh?
You were right, Mr. Hulen, there was a mistake.
Yes.
Hey, aren't you supposed to be out on the track placing bets for us?
Uncle Fester, important men like Mr. Hulen don't go running errands at the track.
That's for the staff.
Right, Mr. Hulen?
Oh, yes.
Yeah.
Oh, well, that brings up an interesting thought.
Now let's suppose, this is a hypothetical case of course, but let's suppose that your investment counselor hadn't placed any bets?
Hadn't placed any bets?
Where's my gun?
- I'd shoot him in the back.
- Now, now, Uncle Fester.
This is an imaginary situation.
Isn't that right, Mr. Hulen?
Yes, of course.
But what would you do?
Since gambling bets aren't enforceable by law Never mind about that.
I'd shoot him in the back.
- Wouldn't that be rather drastic?
- For betrayal of trust?
Violation of professional ethics?
Shooting in the back would be too good for him.
No, I think it'd be about right.
- What do you think, Mr. Hulen?
- I think it's a little warm in here.
- Mr. Hulen, you need a drink.
- Yes No, no!
You know, I think all of this talk of gambling has upset Mr. Hulen.
And I don't blame him.
- There's something evil about it.
- Yes, it's just terrible.
I think for his sake we ought to stop gambling, Gomez.
You may be right, querida.
All right, Mr. Hulen, we're taking your advice.
- From now on, no more betting.
- Oh, thank heaven.
Now, if you'll just hand over the $8 million.
- $8 million?
- Well, you can keep the change.
You know, you were right, Gomez.
Especially after I read what The Handicapper says about our horse.
Granny's Lover.
100 to 1.
"Fell down, starting gate, Memorial Day.
"Pulled up lame last time out.
A real dog".
You know, we could have blown our whole bankroll.
Mr. Hulen, it was very lucky that you came along when you did.
- Lucky?
For whom?
- For us, old boy.
And I can tell by your expression that that's all you really care about.
Such loyalty.
Hits you right here.
Okay, eight million bucks.
It's locked in my safe at the office.
We'll go down with you.
We can start handing some of it out on the way back.
Well, could you hand some of it out to me now?
Why, of course we could, Mr. Hulen.
How much would you like?
$8 million.
Mr. Hulen, have you been gambling?
A hypocrite.
I still think betting is wrong.
Especially a dog who hasn't won a race for four years.
It'd be like throwing the money away.
That's right.
But you can't quit now.
You're on a winning streak.
Mr. Hulen, how can you say things like that?
Easy, remember?
I'm a hypocrite.
- Oh, yes.
- But this horse is lame.
Excuses.
Excuses.
Well, that's just a dodge to drive the price up.
Are you sure you're not a tout?
- Where's the old Addams spirit?
- Right in your safe.
With that $8 million.
You can't back out now, it would be immoral.
Mr. Hulen, you're very kind to be concerned about us.
But we can see how all this is upsetting you.
You were quite right when you said, "Gambling is a disease of barbarians".
Well, I didn't say that.
Shakespeare said it.
You quoted him.
Well, you know me.
Big mouth.
And what about your dream?
The trip to the moon.
- It was a momentary whim.
- Whim?
Oh, a trip to the moon can be, well, a liberal education.
- That's true.
- Of course.
- Still - No still about it.
Everybody should have a trip to the moon.
I like your spirit, Hulen.
You're not making much sense, but I like your spirit.
So do I. Darling, let's make one more bet.
- Just as a favor to Mr. Hulen.
- Oh, thank you, thank you.
My man's at the track and he knows just what to do.
There goes $8 million.
What's $8 million when you got a business manager like Mr. Hulen?
$8 million.
Oh, the race is on television.
I'll get it on.
They're on.
It's Banner in front.
Toby's Boy is second.
Joey Belle is third by two lengths.
Darling Debby is fourth.
Granny's Lover didn't even get started.
Get moving, you ox.
Don't stand there, stupid, run!
Uncle Fester, please, I do not like crude talk, even to horses.
Would you mind moving, sir?
Granny's Lover trailing.
Mr. Hulen, you don't seem to understand.
Our horse is losing.
- Yes.
- That's bad.
Oh, yes, yes, of course.
Poor Mr. Hulen, I don't think he knows what's going on.
State of shock.
At the mile turn it's Toby's Boy by a head.
Banner is second to half.
Joey Belle third on the outside.
Darling Debby is fourth the length.
And here comes Granny's Lover.
He heard me.
He heard me.
He heard me!
Ride it, you old rascal!
You gave Mr. Hulen such a fright.
Come on, something.
Granny's Lover is fifth!
He's fourth!
He's third!
Mr. Hulen, do you hear?
Our horse is gaining.
Cheer up, old man.
Somehow I have the feeling that Mr. Hulen is not enjoying this race.
The excitement is too much for him.
- I'd better turn it off.
- No, no, don't please.
I couldn't stand the suspense.
Joey Belle and Granny's Lover.
Joey Belle and Granny's Lover.
Joey Belle and Granny's Lover.
Granny's Lover on the outside is going to the front.
He's driving!
Joey Belle's on the move.
Here he comes.
He's moving up again.
Head and head.
Joey Belle and Granny's Lover.
- They're heading for the wire.
- Heading for the wire?
Shouldn't they finish the race first?
That's just an expression, querida.
Pay no attention.
- Come on.
- I can't bear to watch.
They're nose and nose!
I can't even bear to listen.
And the winner is Granny's Lover!
Mr. Hulen?
Mr. Hulen?
That Hulen, can you imagine?
Going to sleep during that race?
Darling, let's wake him up and tell him the good news.
Mr. Hulen?
- The race is over.
- Did Joey Belle win?
Granny's Lover finally came through.
ANNOUNCER ON  Just a moment, ladies and gentlemen.
I don't like the way he said that.
Granny's Lover has been disqualified for crowding, shoving and kicking.
How ridiculous.
What else do they expect from a horse?
Well, I guess we'd better wake Mr. Hulen and break the news to him.
Let him sleep, darling.
Poor man will be so disappointed.
Serves him right, the tout.
Well, there's one consolation.
It's still a nice round figure.
I'm glad we didn't go to the moon.
Yeah, I found out that there's no fish on the moon.
We need some new fish for our aquarium.
Ours ate each other up.
Oh, Gomez, the children will be so disappointed.
You know how they love their pet piranha.
Think no more about it, my dear.
There's always one man who's ready to help us with our problems.
Mr. Hulen.
Hello, Mr. Hulen?
Addams here.
I just called to tell you that I'm taking my family on a nice, long cruise.
You are a darling.
We're going to gather some fish for our children's collection.
New ones.
Have to go deeper and deeper, you know.
So would you be a good chap and run out and buy us a submarine?
With nuclear power, of course.
Mr. Hulen?
Hulen?
By Jove, I think he's fallen asleep again.
Strange man.
Nothing seems to excite him.

Mail's in.
- I didn't hear anything.
- Probably a special delivery.
I'll get it, Lurch.
Thank you, Thing.
And Thing, that was very nice castanetting.
You're welcome.
- Is it a bill?
- No, dear.
Oh, well.
- It's from Cousin Itt.
- Itt?
What's he say?
"Arriving Tuesday.
Itt".
Some people have a talent for letter writing.
Dear Cousin Itt.
He does turn a colorful phrase.
Morticia, today is Tuesday.
- Cousin Itt?
- I doubt it.
Itt likes to climb through the window.
That could be Park Commissioner Fiske.
- Coming here?
- At 7:30.
That would make it exactly 7:30.
He's right on time.
Commissioner Fiske.
Well, this is an honor, sir.
My dear, our esteemed Park Commissioner.
Commissioner, my esteemed wife.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
My husband always speaks so highly of you.
Well, I What's that?
That's our Uncle Fester.
He always takes a light with him when he explores the tunnels under the house.
That new one Pugsley dug is just great for banding bats.
I got 20 of the little furry things already.
Good work, Fester.
Uncle Fester, this is Park Commissioner Fiske.
I'm glad to know you, Mr Park Commissioner?
When are you gonna get rid of those awful robins and larks that you have in your parks?
They just keep chirping and warbling.
They do make ghastly sounds.
We can solve that problem, Commissioner.
Uncle Fester could lend you his pet hawks.
Clean up the park in one day.
Pet hawks?
Commissioner, what can we do for you?
Well, as you know, the city is busily expanding its zoo.
Zoos.
Such homey places.
Yes.
Naturally, we depend on public-spirited citizens for financial support.
Say no more, Commissioner.
To whom shall I make it out, Commissioner?
Oh, the check.
Make it to the City Zoo.
You really ought to slow down a bit, Commissioner.
You've just started on the job and already you've got the shakes.
Here you are, sir.
$150,000 and 20 cents.
- Twenty cents?
- I threw in your car fare.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, Uncle Fester.
Thank you, Mrs. Addams.
Thank you, Mr. Addams.
And thank you You're quite right, darling.
He should slow down.
Ah, the gay abandon of the Csárdás.
The wild rhythm of the tambourines.
It sets my Gypsy blood afire.
Darling, you have no Gypsy blood.
I haven't?
I must have a fever.
Nonsense.
C'est la dance.
Tish, when you speak French it really drives me wild.
- Mon ami.
- That's it.
Speak some more.
Au revoir.
Ooh, la, la.
Darling, please.
There's someone at the door.
We're married.
Cousin Itt?
Wait here.
Crepe suzettes.
Comme ci, comme ça.
Oui, oui, monsieur.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Cousin Itt.
- Tell him we're out.
- Gomez.
Go on, Tish.
Speak some more.
Moulin Rouge.
Vive la France!
Cousin Itt?
Show him in, Lurch.
Show him in.
Oh, oh.
You're too late.
There he goes.
Up the wall.
And in through the window.
Good old Itty.
Comfortably settled in the attic before you can say, "Sweep out the cobwebs".
The perfect houseguest.
I didn't get the last line.
And then Marie Antoinette says, "Operator, I've been cut off".
You know, it's not the joke, though.
It's the way that he tells it.
Fester, you've never looked better.
- Good morning, querida.
- Good morning, darling.
Where is everyone?
They're up in Cousin Itt's room, helping him pack.
He's leaving already?
Just a rolling stone.
I don't know.
He seems to have gathered quite a bit of moss.
I wonder why he's never married.
Obvious.
He likes to play the field.
Maybe if he had a good job.
He's such an amusing fellow.
Perhaps in the field of entertainment?
An actor?
Cousin Itt?
Darling, face it.
He's much too short.
Too short for an actor and too tall for a producer.
I suppose show business is out.
The Beatles?
No.
He'd be too much for them.
Oh, it must be spring.
The vampire bats are playing around the attic eaves.
It's Cousin Itt.
He's been attracting them in droves.
Dear Itty.
He always did have a way with bats.
And baby rattlers.
My dear, the new zoo.
Commissioner Fiske once mentioned needing a new curator.
Do you think he'd consider Cousin Itt?
- Cousin Itt is a zoo type.
- He is.
If we could only convince the Commissioner.
He'll listen to reason.
Especially if I threaten to cancel the check.
I'll call him.
Why, thank you, Thing.
He never gets a wrong number.
Mrs. Addams, this is indeed a pleasure.
I'm afraid I don't quite follow you.
Let me put it this way.
The most exciting contribution we can make to your new zoo is in our attic right now.
Really?
Well, I'll be right over.
He's on his way over.
Splendid.
Cousin Itt's not leaving just yet.
- Are you sure?
- Positive.
I'm locking him in.
Here we are, Mr. Fiske.
This is the key, Commissioner.
The answer to all your questions is behind that door.
- We'll be waiting for you downstairs.
- Yeah, but That was a rather brief encounter.
Say no more, Mrs. Addams.
Say no more.
You were absolutely right.
This is the most sensational thing that's ever happened to the zoo.
We knew you'd be impressed.
Oh, I shall be back with a couple of attendants.
We don't wanna lose him.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you, thank you and thank you.
Excuse me?
Oh, this is the best thing that ever happened to the zoo.
There must be some name?
Why, of course, Commissioner.
- Itt.
- Itt?
Itt.
Oh, perfect.
Absolutely perfect.
The key to success, querida, the ability to detect and choose good manpower.
Cousin Itt must have really turned on the charm.
Itt's the one that can do it.
And to think, he's coming back with an escort.
This time I don't blame him.
Cousin Itt is quite a prize.
Yes.
Now, keep those chains taut, men, and keep away from his fangs.
- You, Smirch.
- Lurch.
Open that door.
Lurch, the wine goblets.
Please ask Cousin Itt to join us.
I believe he left with the gentlemen from the zoo.
Already?
Looks like Cousin Itt's going to be a pretty busy man.
He was quite tied up when he left.
To Cousin Itt.
Un momento, querida.
Perfect.
Thank you, Thing.
Tish, you keep improving with every stroke.
Such sweep.
Such grandeur.
- I know just what you should call it.
- What?
Chaos.
Chaos?
Darling, that's Mama.
Oh, yes, yes.
The new hairdo.
That reminds me.
Isn't it about time for Uncle Fester to come home from the zoo?
Howdy!
There you are.
How did it go, Uncle Fester?
Oh, wonderful.
I had 15 bags of popcorn.
What about Cousin Itt?
Oh, I didn't even see Cousin Itt.
- No?
- No.
You see, he's got this nice big office with lots of fancy ironwork in the front of it.
Boy, you should have seen the crowd that was waiting outside.
That's Itt.
Real take-charge man.
I couldn't even get near him.
But I did see them bring him his lunch.
A nice big bunch of bananas.
Smart.
Fresh fruit to ease the ulcer-producing tensions of big business.
And he'll need it, too.
He's got problems on his hands.
I heard on the car radio that one of the animals escaped.
Oh?
ANNOUNCER ON  According to the latest report, the escaped creature has been sighted in the Greenbrier Woodlawn area.
That's our area.
Citizens are urged to lock and bar all windows and doors.
Take no chances with this strange beast.
What are we gonna do?
What any normal family would do.
Protect ourselves as best we can.
A capital suggestion.
Everyone, en garde!
Oh, even when I speak French.
- Gomez.
- Pardon me.
I'll read this again.
"Order of the day.
"Shooting will be confined to the escaped beast only.
"Not at just anything that moves".
All right.
Who's the culprit?
I guess I panicked.
Lost my head.
It's this awful strain waiting for that escaped beast to pounce on us.
Uncle Fester, we're all in the same boat.
Fester, why don't you make an inspection trip of all the traps I've set up through the house?
That'll keep you occupied.
And Fester, if you start to crack up, think of Cousin Itt and all the problems that he's facing now.
I'm so ashamed.
This is rather like being in the jungle again.
Isn't it, dear?
You were wonderful to have on safari, Tish.
No one could skin a hippopotamus like you could.
Darling, any housewife can do that.
You were the remarkable one.
Well.
I'll never forget when that tiger broke cover And charged our gun-bearer.
Ah, yes.
Dear Ali Casbah.
Quick as a wink and without a moment's hesitation, you snapped your gun to your shoulder and fired.
Bagged ourselves a wonderful gun-bearer.
Poor Ali.
He did recover quickly, though.
He must get used to that sort of thing.
Now, what are you going to do about that, cara mia?
Caramba.
Oh, I'm sorry, darling.
That escaped beast is preying on my mind.
I just can't concentrate.
Querida, couldn't concentrate?
At the door?
You're a good lookout, Thing.
En garde, my dear.
This may be the beast.
Just a moment.
Oh, that's much better, dear.
There's no one there.
Cousin Itt?
What are you doing here?
You should be at the zoo taking charge of things.
Isn't that like our dear cousin?
Wanting to be with his loved ones at our moment of peril.
Very decent of you, Itt, but it isn't necessary.
If that beast shows up here, we'll give him a warm welcome.
Well, you might as well come in and rest up a bit.
"What monster"?
he says.
You don't have to spare us, Itt.
We know all about it.
It's a shame it had to happen your first day on the job.
Itt, stop pretending.
You know what we're talking about.
Maybe he should have become an actor.
It's all over the radio.
ANNOUNCER ON  Our latest report has the escaped monster entering the Addams house on North Cemetery Drive.
Park Commissioner Fiske is reported racing to the scene.
In what Follow me.
On second thought, I'd better follow you.
Gomez, are you sure the monster is nowhere in the house?
I've searched top and bottom.
No monster.
I'll get it, Lurch.
You look after the children.
- This may be the moment of truth.
- Darling, what do you mean?
I didn't think you'd ask.
Addams, are you all right?
Tiptop, old man.
It's so sweet of everyone to be so concerned about us.
I just came here to warn you That the beast has been seen entering our house.
Utter nonsense.
Why would it come here?
Well, there is something about this place.
Thank you.
But we've seen neither hide nor hair of any monster.
What does the beast look like?
Well, you know perfectly well what he looks like!
He's about Well, he's got Look out!
Look out!
Run for your lives!
The monster!
- Where?
Where?
- There!
There!
Oh, that poor man.
He's really got it bad.
Complete crackup.
Can't even recognize his own right-hand man.
He broke out of his cage.
Itt, at this rate it looks as though you'll have to take over completely.
- What?
- What?
Is that true, Commissioner?
Is what true?
Stop stalling, Commissioner.
You heard him.
Only one thing can prompt an act like that, Itt.
Insane jealousy.
Locking our cousin in jail.
Why, I'll have you broken down to junior-grade White Wing for this!
Cousin?
Good thing I drew that check on the wrong bank.
- But - Commissioner, an apology is in order.
Apology, my eye.
Will you choose your burial place and weapon, sir?
Now, Fester, let's not have any dueling.
That's right.
I'll shoot him in the back.
- Would you please turn around, sir?
- Wait a minute.
Will you stop him?
This must be settled with honor, Fester.
All right, give him a blindfold.
Uncle Fester, he must be given a fair chance.
Very well, Mr. Commissioner, I'll give you a fair chance.
I get a shot, then you get a shot.
Now, about face!
No, no, Uncle Fester, there will be no shooting.
It does disturb the neighbors.
I'll call the mayor.
No.
No, no, please, not the mayor, I beg of you.
Very well, we'll forget the mayor.
I'll call the governor.
See?
Even Thing's indignant.
- What?
- What?
- You liked being in a cage?
- Then why did you run away?
Well, that makes sense.
He wanted to pick up his military hairbrushes.
Commissioner, I'm afraid our apology is in order.
I'll send you another check as soon as I recall what bank my money's in.
Forget the apology, forget the check.
Just let me out of here.
I'm afraid we cannot permit Cousin Itt to accompany you.
The work is very healthy, but it's unbecoming of an Addams.
Well, in case you change your mind, I'll reserve a cage for him.
In fact, I'll reserve cages for all of you!
Cages for all of us?
I'm not sure I'd like that.
Of course not, darling.
We'll insist on one big family cage.
Good morning, Lurch.
- Cara mia.
- Good morning, darling.
- Did you sleep well?
- I had the funniest nightmare.
You do look nice and rested.
Not tripe of salamander?
With hard sauce.
The perfect breakfast.
ANNOUNCER ON  We interrupt with a special announcement.
An hour ago a dangerous creature broke out of the city zoo.
When last seen, the monster was heading for the Greenbrier Woodlawn area.
That's us again.
Shall I bolt the windows and doors?
Nonsense, it's probably another relative.
Better set another place.
Oh, and, Lurch, bring a nice big bunch of bananas.
{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
They're creepy and they're kooky Mysterious and spooky They're altogether ooky The Addams family The house is a museum When people come to see 'em They really are a scream The Addams family Neat.
Sweet.
Petite.
So get a witch's shawl on A broomstick you can crawl on We're gonna pay a call on The Addams family Querida.
Thank you, Gate.
- Oh, it's so good to be home.
- Place looks as warm and inviting as ever.
Bat-hunting is fun, but it's nice to be back among our own surroundings.
- What do I do with the bats?
- Just turn them loose in the attic.
Oh, and Lurch, you may have a few of them for your room.
Wait till the children see them.
They'll have a ball.
Bats and ball!
Rather clever, eh, Lurch?
I knew you'd appreciate it.
Dear Mama.
I'm so glad we're home, really.
If we leave her alone too long, she tends to brood.
I don't know why.
She has her lizards and her comfy nail bed.
And if things get dull she can always throw darts at Uncle Fester.
Dear Uncle Fester, he's so sweet that way.
And he makes such a lovely big target.
Mama!
Uncle Fester!
The hunters are home from the hill.
- Gomez, do you smell something?
- Your perfume.
Cara mia, it sets my blood aflame.
- Darling, it's not me.
It's that.
- Oh?
Mama's been burning incense again.
She knows I can't stand it.
- You know what that means, don't you?
- I'm gonna have a sinus attack?
She's been telling fortunes while we were gone.
Oh, I thought she kicked that habit years ago.
Oh, dear.
The worst?
"Sit down and be quiet.
Madame Bovary will be with you in a jiffy".
Mama does have style.
The last time she went on a fortune-telling spree, she was Madame De Pompadour.
Oh, darling, lead me in.
I don't think I can look.
Courage, my dear.
It's probably just a practical joke of Mama's.
- Well?
- I think we'd better go back to the hunt.
Well, my dear, Mama hasn't lost any of the old carnival spirit.
Masquerading as a gypsy.
It's so unbecoming.
She does have occult powers, though.
She predicted that I would run every business I ever had right into the ground.
And, by George, she was right.
Pure coincidence.
Darling, how are we going to get her to stop this without hurting her feelings?
I could set the tent on fire.
Dear Gomez, you still have traces of Mamoud Khali Pasha Addams.
The firebug of the Bosporus.
Breeding will tell.
We'd better have a look.
Isn't this exciting?
Tell me everything.
- It's all in the ball.
- Oh, yes.
Here's a little gratuity for you, Madame Bovary.
Madame Bovary thanks you.
Must be the excitement.
Why, that naughty Thing.
- He's in this with her.
- Working hand in hand.
What do you see?
- I see a jail.
- A jail?
- And you are in it.
- Oh, that's impossible.
Lady, kindly don't argue with me.
Argue with the ball.
- I'm sorry.
Tell me more.
- Time's up.
- See?
- Incredible.
Well, if you get any more messages from up there, just call me.
Of course, of course.
Next please!
She's fabulous.
Next.
Keep moving.
"Lizard tails and rattlesnakes, In the cauldron boil and bake "Eye of newt and toe of frog, "Wool of bat and tongue of dog, Spirits high and spirits low "Tell us what we want to" Oh, oh.
Well, I guess it's time to be getting lunch.
- Mama, aren't you ashamed?
- I don't see why.
I love reciting Shakespeare.
Besides, I made $84 in tips.
Not bad.
I don't care about the money.
I like telling fortunes.
Out of the question.
Oh, please, just a few more?
- Not another one, Mama.
- Querida, be lenient.
Look at the anguish in that soulful face.
Well, just one more.
And then that goes back where it belongs.
On the chandelier.
I do wish Mama would come out of that tent.
She's hoping to go into a trance.
It seems to do things for her personality.
- Peerless Lead just went up to $209.
- And you sold it at $4?
- $3.
- How thoughtful.
Whatever would we have done with a houseful of lead?
This is the place, sergeant.
I'll go inside.
You wait out here.
You see anybody come running out, arrest 'em.
Howdy!
- Are you Madame Bovary?
- Do I look like Madame Bovary?
- Sorry.
- Where did you hear about the Madame?
Well, somebody recommended her.
She really that good?
Well, if you like that looking-into-the-future stuff.
Me, I'm a practical man.
Now, electricity.
That's something you can believe in.
See what I mean?
Please, would you just take me inside?
Well, if you prefer mumbo-jumbo to science.
Come on.
It's up.
It's down.
It's up.
It's down.
It's gone.
Come on.
Come on.
Mama, I got a live one.
Oh, Morticia, Gomez.
When did you get back?
- Short while ago.
- Did you bag me any buzzards?
Oh, yes, we got you some beauties.
We caught them right at molting time.
Oh, isn't that wonderful?
Aren't you gonna introduce us to your friend?
Oh, he's no friend.
He just wants to get his fortune told.
"Lizard tail and rattlesnake, In the cauldron boil and bake" - What was that?
- Mama warming up.
Madame Bovary during office hours.
Can I go in?
You'd better, before she goes into a trance.
- Trance?
- Good luck.
Oh, I do hope Mama conducts herself with poise and dignity.
Can't be more dignified than that.
- You naughty little man.
- What are you talking about?
Lulu May Lou from Louisville.
- Lulu May Lou from Louisville?
- Kansas City?
I don't know Lulu May Lou from Kansas City either.
Sally May Lou?
- Lulu May Sally?
- Let's forget it.
You were gonna tell me about the future.
Oh, yes.
Your future is coming through.
I can see it clearly.
Yeah, well, I can see yours even more clearly.
- Oh, you a gypsy, too?
- No, I'm a police officer.
Lady, you're going to jail.
I better get a new ball.
Everybody seems to be going to jail.
Well, I don't know about everybody.
But lady, you're under arrest.
Come on, Madame Bovary.
Back to the chandelier for you.
Couldn't even tell me he was a police officer.
- Is something wrong?
- This big boor is arresting me.
What's the meaning of this, Mr. Boor?
This woman is under arrest for violation of the municipal code, Section 4-3-3-0.
And she's going down to the station with me.
Sorry, old man, we can't permit Mama to go out with strangers.
He's right.
We've never been properly introduced.
Really?
Well, allow me to introduce myself.
Police Lieutenant James Poston.
- How do you do?
- How do You're pinched.
- Fine beginning.
- Don't fret, Mama.
You'll have the greatest legal brains defending you since Clarence Darrow.
- But, darling, I haven't practiced in years.
- This will be excellent practice for you.
You're right.
First thing we'll do is obtain an injunction.
An injunction for what?
Oh, I'll think of something.
Doesn't hurt to have one handy.
Are you ready, Madame Bovary?
From now on, I'll thank you to call me Madame X. Courage, Mama.
We'll have you out of jail by sundown.
- How, darling, how?
- Conceal a hacksaw in a pie.
Hacksaw in a pie.
But isn't that dangerous?
Remember when we did that for Cousin Cringe?
- Cousin Cringe?
- Yes, he ate the hacksaw.
In fact, he developed a taste for them.
Yes.
Well, forget the hacksaw.
- We'll claim insanity.
- Mama's?
- The Lieutenant's.
- Very clever.
- I'm not sure it'll work.
- Why not?
- Politics.
- Oh, that's true.
I'll have the law declared unconstitutional.
Lieutenant Poston's 3-3-4-0 will be erased from the statutes.
Brilliant, darling, absolutely brilliant.
But didn't Lieutenant Poston say that law was 4-3-3-0?
Or was it 3-3-4-0?
Maybe it was 3-0-0-0-0-0.
I'll have them all declared unconstitutional.
Can't be too careful, you know.
Darling, it's so reassuring to have Mama's defense in your hands.
Well, they didn't call me "the Loophole" for nothing.
No, the name fits you perfectly.
- I'm worried about one thing.
- Worried?
Cara mia.
- About what?
- I don't know what to wear to court.
Hey, let me out of here!
Let me out of here!
Mama, you poor darling, what are they doing to you?
Nothing.
I saw this cup-banging scene in a prison picture once.
- You were very convincing.
- Thank you.
- Where's Gomez?
- He's working on your release.
- Never lost a case, you know.
- Never won one, either.
Perfect record.
- Get your hands off of me.
Release me!
- Now keep moving, keep moving.
Madame Bovary.
Welcome, dear.
You made it just as I predicted.
- I told you she's fabulous.
- What happened?
Well, I was crossing a street in the middle of the block and an officer had the nerve to give me a ticket.
So naturally I kicked him.
Just bear with it.
My husband will take your case as soon as he frees Mama.
- Oh, is your husband a lawyer?
- He's the great Loophole.
Look, mister, I don't make the laws.
Just pay the $10 fine and you can have her out in five minutes.
I'm afraid I couldn't do that.
It wouldn't give Mama time enough to do her famous mess hall scene.
She just loves prison pictures.
Look, I might even get the judge to reduce the fine.
Oh, it's not a matter of money, it's a question of principle.
Just what do you want?
I demand an immediate trial, complete acquittal, and a full apology.
Well, chum, you sure picked the right judge for that.
First case.
"The People v. Addams".
Bailiff, which one is the defendant?
The odd-Iooking one.
I repeat, which one is the defendant?
The old bat on the end.
Trolling on skid row?
Fortune-telling.
The others are her family.
Figured.
- Who's the complainant?
- I am, Your Honor.
This woman is in violation of the municipal code, Section 4-3-3-0.
Is the defendant represented by counsel?
- You are counsel for the defendant?
- That honor belongs to my dear husband.
Permit me to introduce the bar's brightest light, Gomez "Loophole" Addams.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
What goes on here?
Just sit tight, Judge, and we'll show you how to run a trial.
- I warn you, I'll stand for no nonsense.
- I object.
- You object?
- Just testing.
- Bailiff?
- Yes, Your Honor?
- Is this some sort of a joke?
- No, Your Honor.
- And that Addams is really a lawyer.
- I don't believe it.
- I checked.
- I still don't believe it.
But we'll proceed.
This is getting interesting.
Proceed.
And Mr. Addams, you'd better watch your step.
Darling, I don't think he likes us.
Maybe you'd better pay him the $10.
- For a trumped-up charge?
- Offer him $5.
Nonsense, we've got him on the run.
The first witness for the defense will be the victim of this outrageous miscarriage of justice, the defendant herself.
- Swear her in.
- I object.
You object to your own witness taking the oath?
I certainly do.
It cramps her style.
You avoided that trap very neatly, darling.
Gracias, cara mia, gracias.
Will you proceed?
Yes, Your Honor.
I shall ignore the prejudice, intimidation, and irregularities of this entire farce and caution you that no matter what the verdict is, I shall appeal.
Order in this court.
Order!
- I object.
- You object?
Well, you don't expect me to sit here like a dummy, do you?
- I hold you in contempt.
- Well, that makes us even.
That will cost you $50.
Sounds reasonable.
Now will you be quiet?
Or would you like to try for $100?
$100?
Forget it.
Sorehead.
Sir, I warn you, you better shut your clack up and get on with this case.
Yes, darling, I wish you would.
That silly hammer is giving me a headache.
Thank you, Thing.
Makes a wonderful law clerk.
- You need some more light?
- Yes, please.
That's better.
- Thank you, Fester.
- Pleasure.
Your Honor, the simple rule of law involved here is amply demonstrated in the celebrated case of "Vauglin v. Broar" which reversed the decision of Shepherd against Flug which upheld the decision of ex parte Drake.
Reaffirming the dictum Hold it, hold it.
I wish you wouldn't interrupt my husband.
Go on, darling, I'm fascinated.
Would you mind telling me what all that's got to do with this case?
- "Does Macy tell Gimbel"?
- Maybe not.
But let me tell you something.
I'm beginning to doubt your credentials as a lawyer.
- I resent that.
- I think you're a fraud!
That's different.
Olé, olé.
Listen, all of you, this is my final warning.
Your Honor, please, that hammer.
You run the noisiest court.
- Perhaps you'd like to take over?
- May I?
- Be my guest.
- Thank you.
I think we may have misjudged the poor dear.
That hammering does throw you.
Come, cara.
Perhaps you can penetrate the wall of bias and ignorance surrounding this travesty of justice.
I can only try.
Thank you, darling.
Your Honor, one look at the accused should convince you that she is as innocent as a newborn babe.
Madam, I've seen more innocent looks on Murder Incorporated.
Must be this light.
True, a crime had been committed, but not by this saintly old lady.
Hear, hear.
The real criminal is right here in this courtroom, hiding behind a shield of respectability.
- There's the culprit.
- Me?
- Might as well confess, old boy.
- Thought you'd beat the rap, huh?
Wait till Lulu May Lou hears about this.
- May I say a word?
- Please do.
- This is insanity.
- Exactly what we claim.
Your Honor, please.
Did you or did you not enter our peaceful home, pretending to be a lover of the zodiac, and caused this entire mishmash?
- Well, I - Answer the question.
- Okay, I did.
- The defense rests.
Brava!
Brava!
Olé, olé, olé.
Wonderful, Tish!
You tore them to shreds, Morticia.
- May I have another word?
- Please, speak right up.
Thank you.
Well, in all my 30 years on the bench, I have never seen a more preposterous, idiotic, reprehensible display of court conduct.
Well, it did start that way, but you redeemed yourself.
There is only one verdict possible in this case.
- Guilty.
Guilty!
- Thank you.
But we beg you, be lenient with the poor lieutenant.
Well, sorry we can't stay around for the sentencing.
We're double-parked.
You're not going anywhere.
I'm declaring all of you guilty of the worst contempt I've ever been subjected to.
If I have my way they'll reopen Alcatraz just for you.
Isn't that sweet?
Just a minute, Harvey.
I'll have something to say about this.
- Arlene, what are you doing here?
- We'll get to that later.
Right now, I demand that you set aside your stupid verdict.
I'd rather be disbarred.
Why, that old crow's not only guilty of fraud, she's Fraud?
Why, she's positively psychic.
She predicted I'd end up in jail, and I did.
- In jail?
- That's right, Your Honor.
Your wife was picked up on a 412.
- Well, you heard my decision.
- Harvey.
Case dismissed.
- I'm free!
- I told you we'd spring you.
Right was on our side.
Right and the judge's wife.
This Zen-Yogi is wonderful for reading.
So I see.
What is it, Thing?
We would like some more tea, yes.
Thank you, Thing.
- Darling, would you like your tea now?
- Later, my dear.
It's so good to see you with your law books again.
Say something legal for me, dear.
Non compos mentis.
Very appropriate.
My dear!
Did you know that armed robbery was illegal?
I'm glad.
But doesn't that make for unemployment?
Well, no law is perfect.
That's true.
Speaking of law, I wonder whatever happened to old Judge Saunders.
I can find out, if you promise not to tell Mama.
I promise.
Thing?
You can bring it out of hiding now.
You're a sly one.
Keeping the temptation from Mama.
There he is.
I can see him now.
- And he's still a judge.
- Supreme court?
County fair.
He deserved the promotion.

Here you are, darling.

Querida.
Darling.
Did you enjoy your breakfast?
- Truly delectable.
- I'm glad.
I spent the whole morning gathering toadstools for your omelette.
Allow me to express my appreciation with this new policy on my life, with you as sole beneficiary.
How thoughtful, darling.
A million dollars.
What a nice round figure, bubele.
Tish, you know what you do when you call me bubele.
Darling, you've just had breakfast.
You're right.
There's a nice round double indemnity clause in that policy.
Really?
Sounds lovely.
What does it mean?
In case of accident you get twice the amount.
I trust that won't put ideas in your head.
Gomez!
Merely a jest, my dear.
I'm afraid I shall favor you with my presence for an exasperatingly long time with my new physical fitness program.
Darling, where did you get the Indian clubs?
Where does anyone get old Indian clubs?
From an old Indian.
Darling!
Are you hurt?
Gomez, are you all right?
- Who's Gomez?
- You are.
- Bubele.
- What's a bubele?
This is dreadful.
Has your memory been destroyed?
I don't know.
I don't remember.
Oh, my poor darling.
Please.
I don't believe we've met.
Gomez, I'm Morticia, your wife.
- I'm married?
- Of course.
- To you?
- Yes.
Why are you wearing black?
Darling, I always wear black.
You said it was so becoming.
I did?
Are you sure we're married?
Well, of Look, here's the insurance policy you bought for me, see?
A million dollars.
Well, I'm glad I have money.
Here, darling, let me help you up.
There.
Now, your name is Gomez Addams.
And you've just had your breakfast.
And you're in your very own home.
Very depressing.
You don't like it?
It looks like a museum that's been condemned.
Oh, dear.
I must do something to restore your mind.
I was right!
The house is falling.
You rang?
- What's that?
- That's our butler, Lurch.
Is it real or do you wind it up?
Gomez!
Mr. Addams seems to have lost his memory, Lurch.
Perhaps a nice, hot cup of henbane?
Henbane!
Just give me a glass of milk.
Milk?
From a cow?
There's no need to go that far.
Moose milk will do.
Never mind.
Just tell your gargoyle to take off.
He makes me nervous.
Gomez, you hurt Lurch's feelings.
Perhaps a nice visit with the children would soothe you.
Children?
What children?
Our children, dear.
Madam, are you suggesting - that we've been more than friends?
- Gomez, we're married.
Oh, I forgot.
Come along, dear.
Children, say hello to your father.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Father.
How do you do?
Go right ahead with your playing.
We don't want to disturb you.
Surely you recognize your own offspring?
No, but the girl does resemble you.
And Pugsley is the image of you.
- He is?
- Naturally.
Look in the mirror.
I'm afraid.
What the devil is that?
That's Lucifer, my pet.
He's nice and slippery.
I'm going to get you a lovely, golden-haired doll that says "mama".
But what have I done?
- Nothing.
- Then why are you punishing me?
I'm not punishing you.
I just want you to get rid of that ghastly bug.
Yes, yes, dear.
Pugsley, why don't you show your father what you can do with the trains.
Watch this, Father.
Swell wreck, wasn't it?
Swell wreck?
The boy needs help.
Until you pay for those trains, I am cutting off your allowance.
But I don't get any allowance.
Starting today, you'll get an allowance so I can cut it off.
There's a touch of madness around here.
Children, your father isn't himself.
And until he gets better we're just going to have to humor him.
- We understand.
- Father's flipped!
Pugsley!
I'm afraid you're right.
- Why do you keep staring at me?
- Doesn't everyone?
I'm so glad to see you and Uncle Fester having such a nice chat.
Uncle Fester.
From your side of the family, I hope.
You'll have to excuse him, Uncle Fester.
He's had a lapse of memory.
And a bad shock.
Several bad shocks.
What he needs is a good workout in the playroom.
A half an hour on the bed of nails and you'll be in as good a shape as I am.
Now I'm worried.
Come along, darling.
It might do you some good.
Come along.
This is the playroom?
Of course.
A place of joy and laughter.
- He's not laughing.
- Lurch holds his laughter inside.
Let it out, Lurch.
Put it back, Lurch.
How's your headache, Uncle Fester?
A couple more turns ought to do it.
Darling, you've always loved this room.
Don't you like it now?
It has its points.
Well, this is an interesting old woodcarving.
- Me, a woodcarving?
- It's alive!
Mama, he's had a lapse of memory.
I'm thinking of putting him on the rack.
Good idea.
A few twists might straighten him out.
A few twists?
Yes, darling.
You see, we tie your hands and your feet and then Lurch turns the crank.
- And that will make me better?
- And taller, too.
You're trying to kill me.
- Oh, no, darling.
- Get that double indemnity No, no, no.
You're dearer to me than all the bats in all the caves in the world.
Now trust me, Gomez.
All right.
But I'm not going on that rack.
All right, darling, you don't have to.
Perhaps if you took part in some simple household routine, it would do more to bring your memory back.
I have it.
Would you like to help me feed the plants?
- Yes, that sounds harmless enough.
- All right.
- Mama, would you care to join us?
- No, I can't.
I have to stay in the stock another hour.
It's my beauty treatment.
Better make that two hours.
- Go ahead, darling, feed her.
- With hamburgers?
What else?
Go on.
- That thing tried to eat me.
- Nonsense.
Humans give her terrible heartburn.
Show Father how much you love him, Cleopatra.
It's choking me.
Nonsense.
She's embracing you.
You're trying to kill me!
To get that insurance money.
Oh, Cleopatra.
I know, darling.
I know how it feels to be scorned.
You must believe me, Gomez.
I would no more harm you than a vulture in its nest.
Vultures!
Are they circling already?
Of course not, bubele.
Don't call me that ridiculous name.
It used to thrill you.
It would turn you into a fiery furnace of affection.
Impossible.
Let's recapture those mad moments, Gomez.
Kiss my arm.
Your arm?
Darling, I'm yours.
From shoulder to knuckle.
Isn't that rather unsanitary?
I must awaken you, Gomez.
And I will.
Not in that absurd outfit.
- Darling - No offense, but something must be done about your clothes.
- Just your type.
- Oh, no, Gomez, please.
He's sicker than I thought.
You don't like my presents?
Oh, darling, of course.
I always love your presents.
It's just that they're so expensive.
Well, certainly they're expensive.
But it's worth it to see my wife dressed properly.
Son, why don't you go lie down for a while?
You're not well.
Nonsense!
Never felt better in my life.
I shopped like mad.
Beautiful, isn't it?
I think I better go lie down.
They're all so lovely.
I don't know which to try on first.
Well, perhaps I have overdone it a bit.
Yes.
I need time to absorb your generosity and to think about it.
Lurch, would you put these things upstairs in my room?
I'll try them on later.
Darling, why don't you relax?
It's not very easy to relax around here.
Well, of course it is.
Stand on your head.
He's even talking of chopping down my beautiful African strangler.
Kill Cleopatra?
- That's murder!
- Father wouldn't do that.
Your father's ill, dear.
He doesn't know what he's saying.
I just don't know what to do.
I'd hoped one of you might have a suggestion.
How about a little heat therapy?
That might snap him out of it.
I could boil some oil and dip his head in it.
No, no, you did that for his migraine, remember?
It just made him hotheaded.
Yes, Thing.
What is it?
Do you have an idea?
Oh, no, no.
I read about that, too, but I couldn't do it, I just couldn't.
Do what?
It's here, in Grandpa Squint's old medical book.
I marked it.
See?
"When amnesia is caused by a blow on the head, "it can sometimes be cured by giving the victim a similar blow".
But I could never do that to Gomez.
We'll just have to wait and hope that he comes to his senses before he destroys our beautiful way of life.
I never thought anyone in this family'd go nutty.
Well, maybe he'll be better when we get back, honey.
I'm taking the children to the movies to see The Batwoman From Outer Space.
- They love those true-life stories.
- Lovely, Mama.
Children, you run along now.
But take the back door and don't disturb your dear father.
- Oh, goody, goody.
- Oh, goody, goody.
Morticia can't do it, huh?
If it'll make Gomez well, I can do it.
I love that boy but I'll clobber him.
Well, hello there, Fester.
- Didn't hear you come in.
- I sneaked in.
Must have dozed off.
Fell out of the chair.
- How do you feel?
- Fine.
Never felt better in my life.
You're looking mighty good today.
Handsome as usual.
- Where's Morticia?
- I'll call her.
Morticia!
Morticia!
Oh, Gomez, darling, I was going to try on these dresses but I didn't know which one you wanted to see first.
Great jumping catfish!
Where did you find those monstrosities?
- Find them?
But - Never mind where they came from.
Put them back, cara mia.
Please.
Oh, yes, Gomez, darling, yes, I will.
- I'm so happy.
- Querida mía.
- I'll be right back down.
- Cara.
It's for his own good.
Gomez, darling.
I thought I'd bring these things all downstairs and then call a junkman to come and get them.
Junkman?
For your new clothes?
Well, since you've told me to get rid of them, I thought No, no, my dear.
I said get rid of that horrible black thing.
- But, bubele?
- Not bubele.
Very well, Mr. Addams.
I Perhaps, I'm too strict with you, my dear.
After all, you are my wife.
Yes, and it isn't easy.
So you may call me "honey bun".
Or "doll boy".
Doll boy.
Oh, he is sick.
Now run upstairs and get rid of that black thing and put on some proper clothing.
If this goes on much longer, the proper clothing for me will be a straitjacket.
Very well doll boy.
Doesn't seem a bit better, does he?
You children go play.
I've got things to do.
You mean hit my own father with an Indian club?
- It's for his own good.
- Then you do it.
- He might get mad at me.
- He might get mad at me, too.
But while Father is ill, you're the head of the family.
Hand me that club.
Gomez darling, you don't know what it means to me to have you well again.
Well?
I'm always well when I'm with you, cara mia.
Later, darling, later.
Later.
Right now, I'm starved.
Anything your heart desires.
How about some of that nice baked iguana?
Capital!
An iguana sandwich and a steaming cup of pinecone nectar.
Darling, you go right over here and you sit down and make yourself comfortable.
I want to fix it myself.
Querida.
There he is.
In the chair.
- What if he sees us?
- I'll take care of that.
- Hello, Father.
- Hello there.
- I have a surprise for you.
- Good, I love surprises.
- Close your eyes.
- All right.
- Keep them closed real tight.
- I will.
I'm sorry it took so long, darling.
But I wanted everything to be just so.
- Is there something wrong?
- I just had a dizzy spell or something.
Well, this will fix you up.
- What's that?
- Why, it's your lunch, darling.
Baked iguana and pinecone nectar.
Good heavens!
Of all the nauseating-Iooking concoctions.
- Are you trying to poison me?
- Darling, don't even Oh, no, you're sick again.
Now what am I going to do?
Well, for one thing, you could bring me some decent food.
A hot dog with chili on it, a bottle of orange pop, and a slab of apple pie with cheese.
Oh, Gomez!
That's all it says, Uncle Fester.
"A blow on the head".
You must have done it incorrectly.
You know, I thought I did it real good.
He seemed well after I belted him.
He was for a while, but it just didn't last.
There's only one thing left to do.
Oh, boy!
Hit him again.
This time I'll belt him No, Uncle Fester, this time I'll do it.
But I'll need your help.
I'll hold him for you.
I can't do it.
I can't bear the look on his face when I hit him.
- Should I put a sack over his head?
- No.
No, I have a much better idea.
You know those long drapes in the living room?
Sure.
You tell him that you're playing a game with the children and then get him to hide behind them out of sight.
Oh, boy, this sounds like fun!
That way I can give him the club treatment without looking at his dear, sweet face.
There he is.
I'll get him behind the drapes, then you conk him good.
- I hope it works this time.
- So do I. His poor head must be getting lumpy.
Yeah, but on him it looks good.
Hi, Gomez.
I've been looking all over for you.
The children and I are gonna play hide-and-seek.
- Would you care to join us?
- I'm busy.
Come on, Gomez, you need the relaxation.
- All right, all right.
- Come on.
Come on.
- I'll play.
- Good.
Now we'll hide over there behind the drapes.
They'll never find us.
Come on, now, you take this side.
Over here, like that.
And I'll get in here.
- Are you ready, Gomez?
-  Ready.
We're ready!
Darling, forgive me.
- What in the world did you do to Fester?
- Gomez!
I thought it was you!
Me?
You thought I was right.
You are trying to kill me.
No, darling, I'm only trying to make you well.
- With a club?
- Yes!
- You want that insurance money.
- No!
You won't get me!
I'm getting out of here!
My poor, battered, wounded love.
Speak to me.
Ah, querida.
Darling, you're well at last.
Bubele.
A little harder, Thing.
That's it.
Nothing takes the knots off a man's head like sandpaper.
Dear Thing.
He has such a gentle touch.
That fire smells good.
What are we burning?
Your Indian clubs.
If I did half the things you said I did, I must have been a sick, sick man.
Thanks to you, cara mia, I'm all well now.
You really should thank Uncle Fester, dear.
Thank you, Fester.
Who's Fester?
Oh, no.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
Ninety-six, ninety-seven, ninety-eight, ninety-nine, one hundred.
- There, that's that.
- Thank you, Mother.
That new cactus brush really makes my head feel nice and tingly.
Well, I'm glad, darling.
I'll just go upstairs and throw away your old porcupine-quill brush.
- And thank you, darling.
- My pleasure, cara mia.
- In fact, why don't we go to 200?
- No, thank you.
You can't improve on perfection.
Thanks to you, Fester.
Thanks.
And thank you, Thing.
But I would suggest that you trim that scratcher.
I think I detected a slight hangnail.
Well!
What was that all about?
He'd be a real sorehead, if he had a head.
Thing has been a bit off lately.
Moody, he's morose.
Hardly ever plays his castanets for us anymore.
Tish, doing those fiery flamencos with you always made my blood run hot.
Come, querida, let's do one now.
Oh, no, darling, it's just not the same without Thing's castanets.
I could click my teeth for you.
No, Uncle Fester, I'm afraid you don't get the same beat.
You don't have very musical molars.
- Darling, why won't Thing play for us?
- Who knows?
Temperament.
Mama.
Has Thing been acting strangely lately?
Why should I know?
To me he's always strange.
Wednesday?
Fester?
If you ask me, Claude Cuticle is a spoilsport.
Darling, why is everyone so resentful of Thing?
Well, he has been a bit stubborn of late.
Can you imagine not wanting to play fast draw with the children?
Well, would you if you couldn't say "bang" and win once in a while?
- Lunch.
- Oh, thank you, Lurch.
And it's so nice that you're your same sweet, lovable self.
Thing, Lurch has announced lunch.
You may ring.
Thing!
Oh, he's really in a mood.
I'll ring.
Thing All right, Mr. Fingers, you asked for it.
You know, Tish, there are some times I wish your name were something like "Oo-oo".
"Oo-oo"?
It's almost impossible to blow smoke rings and spell out "Morticia".
Well, darling, it's the thought that counts.
Lurch certainly outdid himself with that lunch.
Marinated gizzard of lizard.
En crouton.
Still, it wasn't the same without Thing at the table.
He's so handy for passing.
And fanning hot soup.
Oh, darling, do you remember the time he spilt the salt and he almost went mad trying to find a shoulder to throw it over?
Now.
It's odd.
The one in the middle always comes out that way.
- A spare leg could come in handy.
- That's true.
Oh, I see my roses need trimming again.
No matter what I do those smelly petals keep growing back.
Hand me my shears, please, Thing.
Thank you, Thing, I knew you'd come around.
Thing!
- Oh, darling, I thought it was - Nonsense.
Thing only likes to hold hands.
You know, dear, I'm getting very concerned about him.
I think we ought to find out what his trouble is.
Capital idea.
Thing?
Come on, Thing, I want to have a man-to-hand talk.
Thing?
Thing?
- Sounds empty.
- I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
If there is a bottom to it.
Thing.
Thing?
Thing.
Haven't seen Thing around, have you?
I thought not.
Find any clues?
No, dear, but I found this in one of Thing's favorite boxes.
Thing's parents.
Probably their wedding picture.
- Lovely couple.
- Yes.
Darling, doesn't it strike you as odd that Thing would go away - and leave a treasure like this behind?
- Yes.
I mean, he just wouldn't pack up and Darling, do you suppose Thing has met with foul play?
- Exactly my thoughts, querida.
- What are we going to do?
The only thing we can do with a mystery.
Solve it.
I shall conduct an investigation immediately.
Fingerprints!
My own.
Where were you on the night of March 3?
- Gomez!
- Sorry, my pet, I tend to get carried away.
But we do have to chercher la femme.
Tish, you know what you do when you speak French to me.
Darling, please remember you're on a case.
That's right.
A case.
Now, what was that about chercher la femme?
An old saying I just made up.
"Find the woman".
Oh, very clever.
Then you do suspect me.
No, my dear.
The other femme in our house.
The mischievous, petite femme.
Wednesday Addams.
I won't talk without a lawyer.
She's a shrewd one.
But the psychological effect of the hose makes them all crack.
- How about you?
- I claim the Fifth Amendment.
- What's the Fifth Amendment?
- Darling, you went to law school.
I was absent that day.
Hey, everybody.
What's going on?
Fester, I'm right in the middle of a very important interrogation.
So that's what happened to the hose.
Don't you know that the whole cellar's leaking all over the place?
- Well, we found out one thing.
- What's that?
We need a plumber.
- I'll fix it.
- I'll help you.
But I haven't finished my interrogation yet.
- Interrogation?
Whose?
- Yours.
Well, Thing and I had a slight brush.
Is this what you call the third degree?
- Is it getting to you?
- Oh, yeah.
Say, you can take it up to the fourth degree.
Uncle Fester, please, you're not cooperating at all.
What is it you wanna know?
We want to know what happened to Thing.
Well, why didn't you say so?
Thing's disappeared.
We know that.
We want to know if Thing met with foul play.
Well, the way Fingers has been acting lately, I'd call it fair play.
Uncle Fester, how can you be so callous?
I've been practicing.
That does help.
Say, why don't you question Mama?
She and Thing had a terrible fight in the kitchen.
They did?
Mama.
Thing ruined my blackbird pie, that's what he did.
- Let them get away.
- Let who get away?
The blackbirds.
All four and twenty of them.
Insisted on helping Lurch pour the tea.
- Lurch.
- Of course.
Lurch!
It's always the butler.
Lurch, I'll thank you to wipe that smile off your face.
You seem pleased that Thing is gone.
Thing gone?
Well, I guess we're right back where we started.
Sorry, old man.
- Darling, why don't we call the police?
- The police?
Well, I suppose so.
Just to handle the details.
Of course, bubele.
Tish, that word.
Darling, remember you're on a case.
You're right, a case.
Operator?
Please connect me with the police department.
Well, of course it is.
If your family Thing was missing, wouldn't you consider that an emergency?
Hello, Police Department?
This is Mrs. Addams.
I'd like to report a missing Thing.
What?
Just a moment.
Darling, shall I ask for the Burglary Division or Missing Persons?
Well, that is a moot point.
Find out if they have a Miscellaneous.
But if it isn't a person, just what sort of a thing is it that's missing, Mrs. Addams?
Is it a pet?
Well, it's a family retainer.
Oh, so it's a servant.
Well, isn't that a person?
Not necessarily.
"Not" Well, have you got a picture of him?
Yes, I believe we do.
Just a moment.
Darling, is that family portrait still around?
Yes, but I'm afraid Thing isn't in it.
Don't you remember?
He took the picture.
Look, lady, unless you can give me something more specific to go on, I'm sorry, but we can't be any help to you.
Who cares?
Run an ad in the Lost and Found.
I found it in a vacant lot.
When I saw your ad Oh, it's exquisite, but it's not our Thing.
Think you could bear to part with it?
- You mean you still want it?
- Oh, yes.
Name your price.
- $2.50?
- $250?
- No, I meant - Too late!
It's a deal.
You'll have to excuse my husband.
He drives a very hard bargain.
Business is business.
Can't have you upping the price on us, old man.
No, no, of course not.
Thanks, thanks a lot.
I'm on my way down to the dump now, and if I find any other bargains I'll let you know.
You do that.
Oh, we'll be days finding just the right spot for all these beautiful things.
Certainly got a wonderful response to our ad.
I'd give them all up for just one look at our Thing.
This may be it.
I certainly hope so.
We're running out of room.
- Special delivery.
- Thank you, Lurch.
Morticia, it's a ransom note.
- A ransom note?
You mean - He's been Thingnapped!
"The ransom is to be paid at the stroke of midnight, "and do not call the law if you expect to get Thing back in one piece".
- Oh, Gomez!
- Courage, my dear, courage.
"Ransom is to be paid by a disinterested party".
I know just the one.
That famous private detective.
What's his name?
- The one who always wears a trench coat?
- Naturally.
- And a snap-brim hat?
- Yes, it's It's Sam, Sam!
It's a figure on a card.
- Sam Heart?
- No, no.
- Sam Club?
- No.
- Sam Diamond?
- That's it!
I'm Sam Diamond.
Mr. Addams?
No, follow me.
Mr. Sam Diamond.
How do you do, Mr. Diamond?
I'm Mr. Addams and this is my lovely wife, Morticia.
- How do you do?
- Just make yourself at home.
Home?
Look, if this is some kind of a shady deal, forget it.
Nonsense.
We're the victims.
- Who was it that got snatched?
- Thing.
Thing?
- What was his last name?
- Thing.
Thing Thing?
What kind of a name is that?
- It fits him perfectly.
- That's true.
Signs himself, "Thing T. Thing".
And the "T" stands for - Thing.
- Thing.
Look, folks, kidnapping is a little bit out of my line.
So if you'll excuse me Gomez, I do believe he's our man.
The ransom note said "a disinterested party".
- He seems very disinterested.
- Exactly.
I'll weigh up the ransom.
- Weigh up the ransom?
- Oh, just a few precious stones.
Thing is worth his weight in them, even with his thumb on the scale.
We'll pay your fee with them, if you don't mind.
Oh, I'm sure Mr. Diamond won't mind diamonds.
No, no, no, it goes with the name.
Did somebody mention diamond?
What is that?
That's Uncle Fester.
We need him to open the safe for the ransom.
Mr. Diamond.
Well, let's get at it.
You mean you don't know the combination to your own safe?
Of course.
Uncle Fester enjoys cracking it.
It turns a mundane task into an adventure.
You know, Gomez, you're gonna have to change the combination on that safe.
It's getting too easy.
I think next time I'll have it wired with nitro.
Oh, boy, I'll get a bang out of that!
Well, let's see what we have here.
Well, I wondered what I'd done with that.
Oh, darling, this bomb won't go off for another six months yet.
I wish you wouldn't set them so far in advance.
We tend to lose interest.
Here we are.
A few samples from our diamond mine.
All of our really fine stones are cursed, of course.
Been in the Addams family for generations.
All right, you're putting me on with the rocks, aren't you?
I mean, they couldn't possibly be real.
- Au contraire.
- Tish, there you go with that French again.
I've warned you, I'm not responsible for my actions when you talk that way.
Darling, please, we have a visitor.
Later.
Now, what's on your mind?
I'm not sure.
You did say you were going to pay my fee in gems.
Oh, yes.
Only too happy to unload a few.
Now let's see.
$8,402!
I trust that's a satisfactory fee.
Oh, sure, that'll be fine.
- Now, what do I have to do?
- Simply follow instructions.
"The cemetery at midnight"?
What could happen to me there?
Don't answer that.
I'll do it.
Certainly inspires confidence, doesn't he?
I thought all the dash and daring of those private detectives in the movies was an exaggeration.
Cara mia, don't be so naive.
The cinema is a reflection of life.
Men like Sam Diamond are forceful, fearless and absolutely infallible.
Diamond, old man!
Back so soon?
Thought you'd tarry to enjoy the moonlight.
We usually do when we visit the cemetery.
Dear Gomez, he's such a romantic.
But where's Thing?
Didn't you deliver the ransom?
- As directed?
- You put it on the last grave?
And then suddenly, a hand, just a hand, reached up and snatched it away.
A hand?
I knew you wouldn't believe me, but it was a hand.
A hand.
- But we do believe you, old boy.
- And it's wonderful.
- Wonderful?
- You made contact with Thing!
You mean that was Thing?
Dear, sweet, wonderful Thing.
Oh, here.
You take the fee.
Just let me get out of here.
Very sporting of him, wasn't it?
Handling the case for nothing.
I think we ought to send him a nice present.
Yes.
One of your man-eating plants, perhaps.
The practical gifts are best.
- Well, Thing ought to be along soon.
- Yes.
Oh, Thing, I'm so glad you're home.
Wait a minute.
Morticia, this whole thing is a hoax.
What?
You sent us that ransom note yourself, didn't you, Thing?
- I thought the handwriting was familiar.
- What's the big idea, Thing?
Neglected Test us Wanted to see if we cared enough to ransom him back.
Well, you got your answer.
And Sam Diamond liked you so much he wouldn't even accept a fee.
Some Things get a little spoiled.
Well, darling, we have been neglecting him of late.
Perhaps we should take him out.
Thing loves music.
Let's take him to a concert.
Splendid.
He can rattle along on his castanets.
I'll call Lurch and have him get the car ready.
- You rang?
- The car, Lurch.
And, oh, Lurch, we have a surprise for you.
Aren't you going to let Thing know that you're glad he's back?
There, Thing.
That should make you feel right at home again.
Thing.
Thing.
I brought you a little present just to show you there's no hard feelings.
A nail file.
For you.
Hey, Fingers, just a little something to show you that I don't hold grudges.
Gee, I was a beautiful baby.
- Where are you going, to a masquerade?
- To a concert.
Boy, you sure look ridiculous.
Fester, it's plain to see you have no sartorial savoir-faire.
I resent that.
Uncle Fester, now, dear, we haven't got time for that right now.
Thing, we're ready.
Oh, dear Thing.
Now, Thing has sartorial savoir-faire.
I'm glad, 'cause he sure dresses funny.
Well, querida, we're off.
- Tish, where will Thing ride?
- Darling, where he always rides.
In the glove compartment.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
All right, sailor, pass the powder and grape shot and we'll rake her fore and aft!
No.
Hey, you mutinous dog.
I'll have you quartered.
Flogged and keelhauled.
- On the double!
- No.
Come on, Fester, be a good sport.
I'm tired of being Benedict Arnold and Jesse James and John Wilkes Booth.
I'm tired of being a good sport.
All right.
If you want to be childish.
Ahoy, my beloved.
Time for another great moment in Addams history.
Will it take long, darling?
I want to have these traps ready by tonight.
Only a moment, chérie.
But what a moment!
It was seven bells on that fateful night in the North Atlantic.
A fierce sou'wester was howling through the rigging, as Admiral John Paul Addams drove his stout little frigate straight into the heart of the German flotilla.
Foaming up at his stern at flank speed was Admiral Tojo and the imperial fleet.
Oh, Gomez, I never tire of this one.
It was then Admiral Addams fired that shot heard round the world after uttering those inspired words, "If you need me, I'll be in my cabin".
Man the pumps, scuttle the bilge, abandon ship.
And get a wrench.
You've wrecked the plumbing again.
I do it every time.
You can take your finger out of the pipe, Fester.
I shut it off at the main.
It could've happened to anybody.
Not to an Addams.
That's four times in a row.
From now on the children mix the gunpowder.
Pretty soon I'll be nobody around here.
I'm going up to my closet.
What's bothering him?
Perhaps I was too sharp with him.
Oh, darling, he'll get over it.
Uncle Fester just isn't too practical.
I may as well go upstairs and call the plumber.
Darling, who's being impractical now?
Why don't I call that nice Mr. Beesley, our insurance man, and let him take care of everything?
I don't think we better bother him again.
Bother him?
Darling, you know how excited he gets every time we call.
I'm sure he'd be terribly hurt if we didn't get in touch with him.
Come along.
One more telephone call from Addams and I am going to kill you, Beesley.
Three big claims paid on this policy in one year.
So just one more policy like that and Excelso-Fidelity Insurance will pull our franchise.
Arthur J. Henson, President, speaking.
Hello, Mr. President.
This is Mrs. Addams.
A very unusual thing just happened in our playroom.
Admiral Addams Well, actually it was Uncle Fester.
You see, they hanged Admiral Addams Well, he accidentally got just a pinch too much sulfur in the gunpowder, so that when he fired the cannon, it hit a water pipe.
A broken water pipe?
My I will not pay another I've only He's charming, but he seems rather confused.
- Lf you'll permit me, my dear.
- Yes, darling.
- Do you understand?
Not one more claim.
- Thank you.
This is Gomez Addams.
What seems to be your problem?
Now get this through your thick head, Addams.
We're not paying you one more cent and that is final!
Come, come, Henson.
You don't really expect me to jump at your first offer?
Oh, you want a better offer?
Well, go jump in the lake.
The fourth claim cancels out the policy.
Hey, hang on a minute.
- What are you saying?
- Here, in the small print.
If we pay off on the tiny claim, we're through with him and we're out cheap.
Hello, Mr. Addams.
We'll play along with you on this.
Your check will be in the next mail.
Well, that was a letdown.
I merely stated my position with impeccable logic and the poor devil caved in.
Darling, you tend to underestimate yourself.
I suppose so.
I've often wondered what would happen if I turned myself loose on the world.
Gomez, the world just isn't ready for you yet.
Did my new cannon get here yet?
Darling, we're going to have to tell him.
Uncle Fester, I regret to tell you that we're going to have to punish you.
You've been spending altogether too much money.
Fester, you won't see another penny of your allowance until 1986.
- You know what that means, don't you?
- No.
Not another shot do you fire in this house until you make it up.
You've been whittling me down around here little by little.
- But this broke the camel's back!
- It's for your own good.
I'm old enough to know what's for my own good.
From now on I'm gonna watch out for myself.
I'll get a job.
"Wanted.
Army Space Program.
"Test pilot prepared to travel extensively".
No.
I don't like army food.
"Be your own boss.
Are you young and ambitious?
"Highest commission paid to dynamic salesmen.
"Must be clean-cut, personable, fast-talker, "conservative dresser, magnetic.
"Apply.
Arthur J. Henson Insurance Agency".
Oh, boy.
That's me!
Are you sure you want to see Mr. Beesley?
Oh, yes.
He's looking for me.
Well, go on in.
Thank you.
You can fill out your hospitalization claim with my secretary.
Oh, but I feel fine.
And dynamic and aggressive.
- I'm your new salesman.
- No, there's some mistake.
No, those things you said in your ad, that's me.
No.
You have to have previous experience.
Oh, I've had plenty of previous experience.
I held the same job for 37 years.
- Selling?
- No.
Public relations.
Yeah.
My father paid me to keep out of public.
Of course, when he died I retired.
Look, I'm on a very tight schedule.
If you'll just leave.
Oh, but I'm a great salesman.
I'm magnetic.
Watch.
And I'm a live wire, too.
Go ahead.
Sell anything you like.
- Oh, good.
Can I have a sales kit?
- Take it.
- Get out of my sight.
- Just like dear old Dad.
Good shot, querida.
That's the third bird we've lost today.
Must be the nesting season, my dove.
- Uncle Fester.
What's wrong?
- I tried.
I knocked on every door in my territory.
I was dynamic.
I was personable, charming, and magnetic.
But it wasn't any use.
Oh, my career is ruined.
I'm all washed-up.
I have a feeling all's not well with Fester.
It's hard to tell.
He puts up such a brave front.
Oh, yes.
Oh, Uncle Fester, dear.
How can you expect to lose a headache with a hot water bottle that isn't even hot?
Nothing will help.
Oh, Lurch.
Put it over there, please.
And Lurch, would you fill this up?
And make sure the water is nice and scalding.
That'll be all, Lurch.
Now, Uncle Fester.
Sit up.
You'll feel a lot better after a nice hot cup of buzzard broth.
No, I couldn't even get a sip down.
But I have a surprise for you for lunch.
Guess.
Gopherloaf.
Oh, I know what you're trying to do.
But it's no use.
Just leave me in my pain.
Gomez, I'm frightened.
Even when he got caught in the tunnel of love he didn't turn down his gopherloaf.
I know.
He thinks he's a failure.
Something has to be done about it.
Tish, go downstairs and keep the children away.
All right, you lily-livered goldbrick!
Are you going to lie there sniveling on that nice warm bed of nails?
Or are you going to get up and fight like an Addams?
Well, if it's all the same with you, I'd rather lie here and snivel.
When a pilot crashes what does he do?
He gets right back into that crate and up into the wild blue yonder again.
And when a lion tamer gets ripped up, does he snivel?
Does he quit?
Not always.
And that's what you're going to do, Fester.
You're going to get up off that bed.
On your feet.
- Now sell your policy.
- Oh, golly, Gomez.
Fester, the Addams spirit!
Good afternoon, sir.
Or madam, as the case may be.
I am your friendly, smiling insurance advisor, come to help you with your problem.
- Well, go on, Fester.
The rest of it.
- This is as far as I ever got.
I find that hard to believe.
Your presentation was sharp, pithy, to the point.
I've got it.
I'll be the salesman and you be the customer.
Now, we'll make this as real as possible.
And you give me all the answers that you get.
And I'll show you how to handle them.
All right?
Now, here we go.
- Good morning, sir.
- I'll buy it.
I simply can't resist a sales pitch.
You have got to give me the answers that you get.
All right, now.
We'll start from the beginning.
All right?
I'll even go outside.
There's nobody home.
- Good morning, sir.
- Get lost!
I'm your friendly, smiling insurance man.
Beat it or I'll put the dog on you.
I think I've got my sights on your problem.
If something happened to you, what would become of your loved ones?
Those creeps?
Now, Plan A gives you the maximum coverage with the minimum expense.
Will you stop bothering me?
It contains total disability, hospitalization, funeral expenses, multiple casualties, plus a tax deduction and an easy payment plan.
By george, Fester, that's an attractive policy.
I think I'll take it myself.
There we are.
Congratulations, old boy.
You broke the ice.
You've just made a million-dollar sale, plus a lovely sales commission.
- I did?
- Yep.
There it is.
Signed, sealed and delivered.
I told you I'd be a success.
A million-dollar policy to Gomez Addams.
- He was a pushover.
- You imbecile.
Don't panic.
I've never seen a policy yet that Arthur J. Henson couldn't wiggle out of.
In the first place, that contract is worthless until it has been notarized in the presence of two witnesses.
Like it said in the sales kit, that's the first thing I had done.
Look on the bright side, Arthur.
It's a whopping premium.
Premium.
Premium.
That's it!
Don't accept the check.
Tear it up, burn it.
Paid in full.
Cash.
Solid gold doubloons.
Well, if everything's under control, I'll get cracking again.
Out!
Out!
Out!
Gotcha, AJ.
There now, Lurch.
You see what a bit of poison ivy can do for a cannon?
Very cheerful.
As long as Uncle Fester paid for it himself, I'd like to make it look as nice as possible.
Lurch.
Attendez.
I've come to save you some money, Mr. Addams.
No.
I'm the butler.
Follow me.
I'm Arthur J. Henson, President of the Arthur J. Henson Agency.
- Dear lady.
You must be Mrs. Addams.
- Yes.
I'm Arthur J. Henson.
This is Beesley.
- Charmed.
Won't you be seated?
- Oh, thank you.
She seems okay.
You can stop worrying.
Mrs. Addams, we'd like to talk to your husband.
Oh, I'm sorry, he's out jumping.
If you'd care to wait?
- Jumping?
- Yes.
From about 20,000 feet.
But he still has his parachute.
Still?
Yes.
You see, he has this theory.
I'm not quite sure that I understand it.
But he hopes to prove that if a jumper jumps using a smaller chute each time, eventually he'll need no chute at all.
Well, how far along is he?
He said he'd have it figured out one way or another by the end of this week.
- Can I start worrying now?
- Worry.
Worry.
Just a pinch more sulfur, children.
High explosives are a tradition in the Addams family.
But only here in the house, of course.
My husband frets so about the children.
Wouldn't dream of taking them on safari.
Safari?
Africa?
Lions, tigers, crocodiles?
Oh, nothing so adventurous.
He just takes them to India and they poke around looking for cobras.
You rang?
Teatime, Lurch.
You gentleman will stay, of course?
We have something extra special today.
Scorpion pâté on fresh toadstools with just gobs of divine belladonna sauce.
Mama's secret mix.
Surely you're not going to serve that to our client, I mean, your husband?
Oh, I suppose I do baby him.
I'm back.
- How did it go, dear?
- Oh, marvelously.
All except the last two feet, and they were impossible.
Dear, this is Mr. Henson and Mr. Beesley from the insurance company.
How do you do?
- Good to see you, old boy.
- Yes.
Mr. Addams, I'm going to let you off the hook.
Out of the kindness of my heart I am willing to cancel your policy.
Refund his premium.
Dear, I thought we'd seen the last of those dust collectors.
Wait a minute.
Did you say cancel the policy?
But why?
Well, because the policy doesn't make sense.
Things like this.
"Double indemnity for flogging by carnivorous plant.
Gunpowder burns.
"Being bitten by an enraged rug".
Good old Fester.
He gave me complete coverage.
Yes, darling.
It's very sweet of you gentlemen to be worried about us, but Would you excuse us a moment?
Darling.
Darling, you simply can't cancel that policy.
Think of Uncle Fester.
He'd be crushed.
You're right, querida.
Henson, I've changed my mind.
- I want to double that policy.
- No!
No!
No!
In the first place, the addlepated nitwit who sold you the policy doesn't even represent us.
Frankly, I don't know how you could have been taken in by such a moronic goofball.
Well, here I am.
Hello, HB.
AJ.
MA.
GA.
Hello, Uncle Fester.
Uncle Fester?
Splendid news.
You've just sold another million-dollar policy.
I did?
By golly, you were right.
I didn't need that sales kit after all.
Well, I'm gonna go up to my room.
Got to unwind.
Go, go, go!
Perfect, children!
Well, I'm not gonna take this lying down.
Excelso?
Henson.
Put me on the hot line.
This is a red alert.
Hello, Chief?
I want to report a big swindle.
Two million dollars.
Addams, Gomez.
That's right.
Two D's.
How did you know?
He is?
He does?
We do?
You are?
I am?
I see.
Addams here.
I do?
I am?
I can?
I will.
It completely slipped my mind that I own controlling interests in Excelso Corporation.
The president, what's his name, just urged me to take a more active interest and make a few decisions.
- Darling, why don't you?
- Very well.
Beesley, I like the cut of your jib.
You recognized Uncle Fester's ability, and that means something to me.
From now on you're my number one boy.
Henson, you'll render all possible assistance to your new boss.
Thank you, Lurch.
Tea, gentlemen?
I'm afraid not, Mrs. Addams.
It's been delightful.
Come on, Henson.
Get cracking.
Darling, I think you made the right decision.
The best since I put Winthrop in charge of Addams Motors.
Remember?
He took a failing company and in three months ran it into bankruptcy.
Dear, you could have done it in one month.
Oh, Fester.
How would you like to be vice-president or chairman of the board or something?
There's no challenge anymore.
I'm just gonna retire and play with my cannon.
Watch this.
Oh, dear, quick.
Call the insurance man.
Oh, no.
I'm through paying these ridiculous claims.
Fester, you're paying for this one yourself.
Gladly.
I have a brand new personal policy.
- Oh?
On what company?
- Yours.
Foiled again.
{END OF EPISODE 24}{START OF EPISODE 25}
Hey, Thing, how about snapping it up a bit?
You know, not all of us are Mozart fans.
Darn it!
I was just getting started.
Uncle Fester, please.
I do not like profanity.
I'll get it, Lurch.
- Are you ready for the big finish, querida?
- Yes, darling.
I hate to disturb you, but you've got company.
Darling, we have company.
We'll have to finish this later, querida.
I was just passing by and I was transported by your lovely music.
How sweet!
It's so nice to have a true music lover in our home.
Gomez Addams here.
This is my wife, Morticia.
How do you do?
And this is the genius himself, Lurch.
I haven't heard such music since my mother passed on.
Oh, your mother played the harpsichord?
No, they played it at her funeral.
How nice.
Since then, whenever I hear it, I get a flutter right here.
- You need a little bicarb.
- Fester.
Oh, my card.
"Oscar Belmont, Curator of the Fine Arts Museum".
It's an honor to have a man like you in our simple home.
Oh, I I wouldn't exactly call it simple.
You seem to have some remarkable museum pieces of your own.
- Do you really think so?
- Yes, indeed.
This harpsichord, for example.
Most unusual.
It's a genuine 1503 Krupnik.
It was in Cousin Crimp's family for over 400 years.
Cousin Crimp used to love playing it.
Played four-handed pieces on it all by himself.
Beautiful.
It should be on exhibit to inspire all humanity.
- You mean in your museum?
- Yes.
But unfortunately we couldn't afford - Say no more.
It's yours.
- But Please.
Please accept it as the Addams' contribution to posterity.
We'll send the truck for it this afternoon.
No.
It may take a little time to prepare Lurch for the shock.
- Oh, yes, of course.
- Yes.
- Well, then, Friday?
- Friday.
Exquisite.
- He is a music lover, isn't he?
- Reminds me of Aunt Trivia.
Was Aunt Trivia a music lover?
No.
She just liked to go around kissing harpsichords.
- Well, on to Lurch.
- Oh, yes.
So you see, Lurch, inasmuch as you love the harpsichord so, the real public benefactors wouldn't be us.
It would be you.
We'd even instruct the museum, Lurch, to name you as donor.
What do you say to that?
I quit.
Lurch, Lurch, you can't quit.
You're like one of the family.
Think of all those glorious, happy years we've spent together.
Think of the children.
Think of Mama and Uncle Fester.
I quit.
Take away my Krupnik.
Lurch, we only meant to do what was right.
You do forgive us, don't you?
Well, then, Lurch, smile to show us that there are no hard feelings.
Come, come, Lurch.
Smile.
That's better.
Now turn the end around this way.
That's it.
That's it.
- There you have it.
- All right, you can let it down now.
Thank you, Lurch.
You've been very understanding.
I still don't see why we had to lug this thing all the way down here.
Uncle Fester, dear, I told you.
We have to acclimatize it.
It has to be damp enough to stand the dry air in that sunny museum.
Got you.
Here's the water.
Where do you want it?
No, no, no, Uncle Fester.
Not that way.
Put it back.
Put it back.
This way.
Now, there's some for you, and there's some for you, and some for you.
- May May I, Mrs. Addams?
- Why, of course, Lurch.
I can't.
I can't.
Oh, Gomez, I think we wounded him beyond repair.
Cara mia, it's your imagination.
- What's that?
- My imagination.
- What's he doing?
- He's flipped.
Uncle Fester, I do not like profanity.
But I'm afraid you're right.
We've left Lurch in the lurch.
We must find some way to fill this void in his life.
I could give him Yvette's address.
Who's Yvette?
My French pen pal.
With the Folies Bergere.
Lurch needs more than a pen pal.
Okay.
Send her the fare and she'll come over in person.
I think Lurch needs a new cultural interest.
Yes.
Well, if you ever have a problem with me, send for Yvette.
Now you're all set, Lurch.
Hit it!
An absolute inspiration, Morticia.
Suits him perfectly.
Come on, Lurch.
Give it the old razzmatazz.
Let yourself go, Lurch.
Just pretend you're in the jungle again, and they're beginning to start the ancient fertility dance.
You can pretend that, can't you, Lurch?
I'll try.
I want my harpsichord.
Well, drums didn't go over with much of a bang.
I guess Lurch is just a hopeless longhair.
I don't understand it.
Now then, Lurch, needles go here, and around with the yarn.
Through.
Now you try.
No, Lurch, no.
One piece at a time.
One piece of yarn.
That's it.
And slip it off.
There.
Isn't that fun?
Doesn't it take your mind off of your troubles?
I thought so.
Now, what would you like to knit first?
A harpsichord.
I suppose the only thing that will make Lurch happy is his harpsichord.
That's no problem.
We'll build him one.
Capital idea!
But, darling, that would take absolute acoustical perfection, the very essence of mechanical precision, and delicate artistry and woodcarving.
Do you think you can do it?
I don't know.
I never tried.
Well, let's see now.
We have the wood, we have the wire, we've got the foot pedals, and 300 felt pads.
Darling, why so many felt pads?
Well, if this harpsichord turns out well, we might decide to build a spare.
I do hope Lurch doesn't find out what you're doing down here.
You will work quietly, won't you?
Don't worry, Morticia.
I soundproofed the saw, see?
No teeth.
Oh.
- But will it work?
- Sure.
Watch.
Well, fellow craftsmen, everyone to work.
- Please do hurry.
- Oh, yeah.
We'll do the job.
After all, how long can it take to build a harpsichord?
Two days?
We'd better be on the safe side.
Make it three.
Whatever you do, don't let Lurch down here.
If he found out what we were doing, he'd be beside himself.
That would make an interesting picture.
Busy, busy, busy.
We will now proceed to build a harpsichord.
- All right.
First I'll measure the old one.
- Good thinking, Fester.
Here we go.
Are you ready?
- All right.
It's 36.
- 36.
- You got that?
- Yeah.
- 21.
- 21.
And 36.
- 36.
- Yeah.
By george, those are Morticia's measurements exactly.
This is going to be fun.
- Please, it's gonna Take - Come over here, will you?
- Take what?
- Here.
You know, Gomez, these harpsichords are hard to build.
Thirty-six hours away from you has turned me into a raving maniac.
Well, rave later, dear.
Right now, finish that harpsichord.
- It's almost done.
- Oh, wonderful.
I couldn't keep Lurch away from that playroom another moment.
Just send him on an errand.
When he comes back, voilá!
The imitation Krupnik will be in place and he'll not be the wiser.
Wonderful.
- Darling, whatever is that for?
- For the strings.
Oh, yes.
They do require delicate tuning.
Oh, do hurry.
Lurch will be here any minute.
There.
What do you think?
I think it looks just like the old one.
Even down to those lovely wormholes.
That's a simple matter.
Just an ice pick and a few sharp taps.
We forgot the most important thing.
There!
A genuine imitation Krupnik.
Oh, it'll be so nice to see Lurch's old smiling self again.
Surprise!
We changed our minds, Lurch.
We told Mr. Belmont we simply could not part with the harpsichord.
He'll just have to get his own Krupnik.
And that's not going to be easy.
These things aren't built in a day.
Takes three.
- It's all yours, Lurch.
- Forever and ever.
I think we ought to leave Lurch alone with his harpsichord for the rest of the day.
Excellent idea, cara mia.
- We'll spend the afternoon at Lovers' Leap.
- What'll I do there?
We'll make love and you'll leap.
- Darling, what about the museum people?
- They'll be along tomorrow.
Excellent, that's Lurch's day off.
What marvelous planning.
We should be in Washington.
Come in.
Excuse me.
- You wanted something?
- No.
I mean, yes.
Just the harpsichord.
We were supposed to pick it up tomorrow.
But as long as we were in the neighborhood We thought we'd get it today.
But we can come back tomorrow.
Yeah, we can send somebody else tomorrow.
You want my harpsichord?
No, we don't want it.
- Mr. Belmont wants it.
- For the museum.
But it's mine!
Sure, sure.
But we have a pickup order.
- Betrayed.
- Not by us.
Look, maybe we're in the wrong place altogether.
- Yeah, the wrong place.
- Stop.
Take it.
- Really?
- Take it!
Certainly.
By george, it's good to get out.
Yes, it always make you appreciate what you have in your own home.
Hey, do you see what I don't see?
- The harpsichord!
It's gone!
- It can't be!
It's gone all right.
- Lurch, where are you going?
- What's that in your hand?
- Where are you going?
- Answer the third question first.
- Yes, where are you going?
- Home to Mama.
Nonsense!
Easy, Lurch.
You'll lose your pension rights.
Nobody cares about me.
- Of course we care about you, Lurch.
- We all love you.
Now, let's not get sickening.
I like you, Lurch, but I don't love you.
Besides, Lurch, you have to give us two weeks' notice.
And think, Lurch, where will you ever find another home like this?
You could wind up butling luncheons at the Optimist Club.
Think how that would crush your spirit.
- I'm going.
- All right.
But I have to warn you, I'm an attorney.
I can hit you with a restraining order.
- Gomez, you can't do that.
- I can't?
How about habeas corpus?
Nonsense, darling.
I think we can settle this out of court.
That's right, Lurch.
Just go upstairs, unpack your suitcase and put away your undies.
We'll take care of everything.
- Those big fellows sure come unglued fast.
- Poor man.
His whole world crumbled when he lost his harpsichord.
Morticia, could the museum have come here and taken the wrong instrument on the wrong day?
It's a possibility.
Why don't we call them?
See if they'll send it back?
Good thinking.
Gomez, darling, it's wonderful the way you just leap in and take charge.
Lead the way.
That's what they said about old Commodore Addams.
- Oh?
When he led his men into battle?
- Off his sinking ship.
Hello, Fine Arts Museum?
This is Mrs. Addams.
I'd like to report a ghastly error.
I believe some of your men came over this afternoon and removed the wrong harpsichord.
You don't say.
You don't say!
- What do they say?
- You heard her.
They don't say.
That's unbelievable.
Well, I don't blame you.
I think you did exactly the right thing.
Goodbye.
- You won't believe it.
- I'll believe it.
You know that nice Mr. Belmont?
Well, he isn't nice at all.
He isn't even with the museum.
He's a notorious crook.
- A crook?
- Yes.
He tried to sell your homemade harpsichord to the museum - for $15,000.
- What happened?
Well, of course they took one look at it and had him arrested.
Well, it wasn't that bad.
Well, of course not, Uncle Fester, but after all, a Krupnik is a Krupnik.
Is a Krupnik.
It's fate.
Our beloved harpsichord is destined to remain in this house.
It's good to have the old Krupnik back again, isn't it?
Uncle Fester, what are you making now?
I'm making a petit point saddlebag for Mama's broom.
How nice.
That old harpsichord sounds magnificent, doesn't it?
Yes, darling.
Whatever happened to the one you built?
Left it at The Midnight Mission.
You'd be surprised how many music lovers they have down there.
- And what about Mr. Belmont?
- His trial comes up in three weeks.
- He'll get ten years.
- Why, querida?
I'm defending him.
- I'm glad.
- You're glad?
Yes, he ought to get life, and with you defending him, he will.
{END OF EPISODE 25}{START OF EPISODE 26}
Here, darling.
Cleopatra, don't gulp.
Morticia.
- Did you see the paper this morning?
- No, dear.
The bottom fell out of the stock market again.
They really ought to fix that rickety old place.
The bottom's always falling out of it.
Oh, it's not the place, it's the stock.
And you know, Gomez could lose millions in a good market but, boy, I bet he lost his shirt today.
He has plenty of shirts.
It's his money I'm worried about.
Come now, Blooker, you've been my broker long enough to know that a little market crash doesn't scare me.
Why, my Consolidated Funds climbed to 60 yesterday.
Unfortunately I'd sold it the day before.
Blooker, I just feel like buying a railroad.
A little surprise for my wife.
We'd better find Gomez and see if everything is all right.
Thing?
Would you finish feeding Cleopatra, please, Thing?
That's good.
Now mind your manners, dear.
Blooker, I know fortunes have been lost speculating on railroads, but what's a fortune?
But Mr. Addams, the people I'm talking about went broke.
Broke?
They're absolutely penniless.
Wiped out.
That's incredible, Blooker, incredible.
Broke, you say?
Penniless?
Wiped out?
Ghastly, absolutely ghastly.
- Uncle Fester, this is shocking.
- It's worse than I thought.
Oh, the poor, poor dear.
Poor thing is right.
They wiped him out like a greasy skillet.
It's hard to believe, Blooker.
As a token of my sympathy, write them a check for $100,000.
And now get moving on that railroad.
Oh, dear.
Oh, thank you, Thing.
And thank you, Cleopatra.
It's so nice to know you have friends at a time like this.
Morticia, what are we gonna do for money?
I'm too proud to beg and too lazy to work.
Never mind, Uncle Fester, I'll think of something.
It's Gomez I'm concerned about.
The poor dear.
He must never know that we know.
It'd kill him.
If his life insurance is paid up, that could be a solution.
- Uncle Fester.
- Hello, Fester!
- There you are, my dear.
- Darling.
I'm gonna be busy all day.
If you want me for anything, I'll be in the library on my private line to my broker.
- Pawnbroker?
I know a fellow that'II - No, no.
Stockbroker.
Naturally, Uncle Fester.
I'm buying up a little stock.
Nothing big.
Just a few million here or there.
You know, a little pastime.
Oh, that poor, brave, darling man.
Did you see him?
Laughing in the face of disaster.
- It almost made me cry.
- Almost?
It does make me cry.
Buck up, Uncle Fester.
I'll call the family together.
We'll handle this.
Spend another million.
Just keep buying.
Now, how much stock do I have so far?
- 100,000 shares so far.
- Fine.
Now, how much do I need to control the company?
About 200,000.
But, Mr. Addams, what do you want with a broken-down railroad like Big Swamp and Southern?
You'll never make any money with it.
Make money?
I've got money.
What I'm looking for is excitement, adventure.
Adventure?
Now, frankly, Blooker, I'm getting a bit bored with my model trains.
I'm just itching to get my hands on a real railroad.
Think what a wreck I could have with those babies.
Wreck?
What else?
Oh, we'd keep the people off.
All right, now, Blooker.
Get moving.
And, oh, Blooker?
Keep my name out of this.
I don't want Wall Street to know what I'm doing.
Now, we must think of ways to make money.
I know an easy way.
- Oh?
- Print it!
- Uncle Fester, that's illegal.
- It is?
- I can get a job as a bunny girl.
- No.
No, I don't like the hours.
Besides, that atmosphere.
You're much too sweet and innocent.
How about a beauty expert?
- Beauty expert?
- Yeah, you know, a hairstylist.
That's perfect, Mama.
Now, remember, we must keep this from Gomez.
Just tell him it's a lark.
Wednesday and I are gonna pitch in, too.
We're gonna open a drink stand on the sidewalk.
Marvelous.
What are you gonna do, Mother?
I think I'll give fencing instruction and tango lessons.
I'm gonna start an escort service.
Me and Lurch.
You know, hire out for dates, like with rich widows, eh, Lurch?
I'm sure you'll be an instant success.
You're both such fascinating types.
Look, Mother!
Thing wants to help, too.
How sweet.
Thank you, Thing.
I feel so good being my own boss, I think I'll take the rest of the day off.
Oh, it's almost perfect.
But do you think it could stand a little dash of hemlock juice?
That's it.
I knew it needed something.
Oh, what a lovely sign.
We're gonna paste a picture on it, too.
Oh, that's a marvelous attention-getter.
You children are going to be fine little merchants.
- Uncle Fester, what are you doing?
- I'm practicing for my escort service.
You see, I figure I'll have all different kinds of women for customers, so I gotta be all different kinds of men for them.
- Oh?
- Well, you know, if they like Cary Grant, I'll be Cary Grant.
Hello, duck, what are you doing today?
And if they like their Frank Sinatra, why, I'll be Frank Sinatra.
Uncle Fester, I think that's a mistake.
Yeah, I think I better get another song.
No, no.
What woman could possibly ask for more than Uncle Fester himself?
Yeah.
Well, you got me there.
Well, well, what's going on?
I haven't seen so much activity since the night I hid the hornets in Aunt Phobia's sleeping bag.
Darling, this is something I'm doing for the children.
I think every child should know the value of money.
By george, you're right.
Attention, children.
Five pennies make a nickel, two nickels make a dime, - Yes, Father.
- Yes, Father.
Good.
Now you know the value of money.
We're running a little low on cigars.
You rang?
Lurch, you better pick me up another 1,000 cigars.
The dollar size.
Thank you.
Well, back to the stock market.
Have fun, everyone!
Oh, that sweet, darling man.
He's trying so hard not to let us know.
$1,000 worth of cigars.
I'm not sure we can afford him.
Oh, look, Gladys, this must be one of those gigolo places.
$50 an hour?
Oh, they must be absolutely dreamy.
See for yourselves, girls.
- What's the matter with them?
- Flighty.
- Well, how's business, kids?
- Pretty slow, sir.
Gee, with a cute sign like that, you should be doing great.
"Henbane on the rocks".
Boy, those trade names get wackier everyday.
- Let me have a tall one, son.
- Yes, sir.
Well, always like to help out the small businessman.
- Cheers!
- Cheers.
- Would you like some more?
- I'd like some help.
I'm gonna tell my lawyer about this.
See?
Satisfied customers always tell their friends.
Oh, my Why, I've tasted better glue than this.
Maybe we ought to sell glue on the rocks.
I bet Mother's making lots of money, though.
En garde.
And parry, thrust.
Parry, thrust.
How're you doing, Morticia?
Are you teaching him anything?
Oh, Mama, I'm so disappointed.
I haven't had a pupil all day long.
Well, I'm pretty disgusted, too.
I went to every beauty shop in town.
Nothing.
I'm very surprised.
Your talent is so obvious.
Honey, it isn't what you know, it's who you know.
That's true.
Good man, Blooker, keep spending.
My dear family, I'm afraid we didn't make very much today, but Thing sold a pencil.
Thank you, dear Thing.
Just a nickel?
We made a quarter.
Oh, that's wonderful, dear.
But the man's going to sue us.
- Oh?
- Morticia?
I guess I was high man for the day.
I made a dollar.
Oh, Uncle Fester, that's wonderful.
Your escort service must be catching on.
Well, not exactly.
A lady gave it to me when I popped up from behind my sign.
- Said it cured her hiccups.
- Oh.
Nothing like a fiery tango right after breakfast to stir up the old hormones.
Yes, it is exhilarating.
- Well, mind if I cut in?
- Please do.
This reminds me of the junior prom.
My date looked just like Gomez.
- Well, can't dance the day away.
- Oh, you got a job?
- Fester, don't be cruel.
- Sorry, slip of the tongue.
Darling, you do have some financial plans, don't you?
Nothing important, mind you.
Just a little amusement.
Gomez, do you have something to tell me?
After all, I am your wife.
No need to remind me of that, cara mia.
Morticia thought you'd like to talk about money.
Money?
Why should I bother her pretty head with a thing like that?
You're not well, Fester.
- Mail's in.
- I'll get it, my dear.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh, the circular I sent for from the yacht company.
Thought I'd buy a yacht and take us all on a world cruise.
- A cruise?
- At a time like this?
I think we could use a change of scenery.
The Dead Sea, perhaps.
Some fun place.
That settles it.
I'm going to sell everything we own.
I must get money for Gomez.
You mean auction him off, huh?
- Oh, you mean get money to give Gomez?
- Yes, dear.
Now, you come upstairs with me and help me get out the family jewels and treasures.
Are you ready?
Ready.
Uncle Fester, I do think we ought to have gotten the combination from Gomez.
Oh, it wasn't locked.
I just like to keep in practice on my safe-blowing.
You do have a delicate touch.
Oh, dear, I dread to think of selling our family heirlooms and treasures.
Cousin Crimp's glass eye.
Those were the days when men were men.
Uncle Fester, look.
Pugsley's baby spoon.
He always did have a strong bite.
And not a bad bark, either.
What's that?
Oh, I'd forgotten all about that.
It was a gift for my 12th birthday from Grandpa Droop.
Stock certificates.
"100 shares, Big Swamp and Southern Railway".
I read something about that in the paper today.
What did I do with today's paper?
Yeah, sure, there it is.
"Wall Street is intrigued by a mystery financier "who is buying stock in the Big Swamp and Southern Railway".
Uncle Fester, do you think maybe he'd buy this?
Why don't we call a broker and find out?
What's the name of that outfit that Gomez deals with?
- Blaker, Blacker, Blooker - Blooker and Company.
Oh, but I don't want to embarrass Gomez by telling some stranger that we need money.
Well, why don't you give him a phony name?
Phony name.
Jones?
What kind of a name is that?
- Smith?
- Much better.
What do you mean you can't find any more stock, Blooker?
I need only another 100 shares to control the whole railroad.
Mr. Addams, there isn't a single share for sale.
I've got men looking all over the country.
- Well, have them look in the city, too.
- Just a minute.
Hello?
Who?
Mrs. Smith?
What?
We certainly are interested in buying your stock.
I can pay you $10,000?
Well, that's awfully nice of you.
- He's offering $10,000.
- Then ask for $20,000.
I'd like $20,000.
- He'll pay $20,000.
- Good, make it $30,000.
I'm sorry, but - $30,000?
- Crook!
Hello?
Uncle Fester!
That always makes them a little more anxious.
Mrs. Smith?
Mrs. Smith?
Oh, no.
- Yes, Blooker.
- I found the 100 shares of stock for you.
Good man, I knew you'd do it!
- But I lost it again.
- Lost it?
That's mighty careless, Blooker.
Put an ad in the lost and found.
- Uncle Fester, I'm worried.
- Big business.
Better play it cool.
- But hanging up on him.
- Yeah, maybe that was a little too cool.
- I think I'd better ask Gomez's advice.
- Oh, you can't tell him what we're doing.
Uncle Fester, you're not the only one in this family who can be cool.
But, Blooker, what if she doesn't call you back, what then?
No problem, I'll kill myself.
Good thinking.
Blooker, if you do get that stock for me, I'll buy you the biggest, thickest, juiciest camel-hump steak in town.
What do you have to say to that?
I'll kill myself.
Got a one-track mind, Blooker.
I like that.
Oh, Tish!
Even when I speak French, it drives me wild.
Darling, I want to ask your advice.
You know, I'm trying to teach Pugsley a little bit about business.
Oh, a chip off the old block, that lad.
Well, he's decided to sell his flea collection and a boy at school has offered him 30 $30 for it.
Well, there's a simple rule, my dear.
Never accept the first nine offers.
When they come up with number 10, grab it.
Take the 10th offer.
It's known as Addams' Law.
Or "How to slit your competitor's throat without getting blood on his necktie".
What a colorful phrase.
It isn't for nothing they call me The Plunger.
- The men on Wall Street?
- The men in the plumbers' union.
But, Mr. Addams, I've got my secretary calling every Smith in the book.
Just a minute.
Hello?
Mrs. Smith.
It's Mrs. Smith, she called back.
Good, don't let her get away.
Offer her $50,000.
Right.
Mrs. Smith, I can offer you $50,000.
$50,000?
Buzzardfeed.
I'm sorry, I'm afraid that's only your fourth offer.
Please continue.
She wants more!
Make it $60,000.
How about $60,000?
- Well - $70,000!
Who is that?
- Well - I'm another customer, that's who is that.
I wanna buy her stock myself, I'll go $80,000!
She's got another buyer.
Great shades of Hades, run him out!
Bid his head off!
How about $100,000?
Isn't that sweet?
Thing wants to get in on the bidding, too.
$200,000?
I'm sorry, Mr. Blooker, I have a third bidder at $200,000.
Wait a minute.
Now, look, I wanted to bid $300,000.
$350,000!
$400,000, Mr. Blooker.
$500,000?
$500,000.
$600,000!
Let's see you top that, nimble knuckles!
He can't go any higher.
That's all the fingers he's got.
Oh, poor Thing.
Hell, I've gotta have that railroad, Blooker.
I just wrecked my last locomotive.
Just a minute, Blooker.
What is it, Thing?
You think I can get the railroad for that?
Thank you, Thing.
I'll make one more offer, Blooker, $1 million.
I'll try.
Mrs. Smith?
Mrs. Smith?
This is my last and final offer.
$1 million.
It's his 10th offer.
- How much?
- What difference does it make?
Sold, for $1 million.
I can hardly wait to get my hands on that railroad.
Nice going, Blooker.
To show you my appreciation, I'm gonna send you a couple of freight cars.
Gomez, darling, guess what I made today?
- That fabulous bat broth of yours?
- No, $1 million.
Oh.
Well, I have some real news for you.
I just bought a railroad.
Oh, darling, that's wonderful, but - A railroad?
- Big Swamp and Southern.
When I blow those tracks, it'll be the wreck of the century.
He bought a railroad.
The Big Swamp He bought it.
Addams here.
Hello, Blooker.
You heard what?
The Big Swamp and Southern sank into the big swamp?
Clear out of sight, eh?
Thanks for calling me.
Oh, well, easy come, easy go.
Oh, I do hope this shawl isn't too short for Cousin Crimp.
It looks perfect.
- And so does this.
- What's that, dear?
I bought your stock, querida, I intend to pay for it.
Oh, nonsense.
Even though you're still wealthy, I refuse to accept it.
It's a matter of honor, querida.
There you are, a check for $1 million.
First National Bank of Siberia?
Nice bunch.
Always pay in cold cash.
Are you sure?
Come to think of it, we Addamses haven't done any business with them since 1917.
Things may have changed since then.
Forget that check, I'll write another.
Second National Bank of Peking.
How could I have ever doubted your financial genius?
Querida, we all make mistakes.
Darling, let's celebrate.
Wine, Thing.
Thank you, Thing.
How convenient.
Instant wine.
- Cara.
- Darling.
{END OF EPISODE 26}{START OF EPISODE 27}
Dear Pugsley.
He does enjoy playing with his missiles.
Keeps him out of mischief, too.
It's amazing how that little rascal manages to keep one step ahead of the government space program.
A true Addams.
Ah, it's midnight.
The perfect time for a little family picnic.
We'll surprise the children.
Oh, darling, they have to get up so early to go to school.
Well, then we'll leave them here.
That should certainly surprise them.
Dear Gomez, so wise and understanding.
That's exactly what they said about old Senator Addams just before they impeached him.
Lurch, bring the car around back.
Oh, you can't beat a night like this for a picnic.
- And snail-hunting.
- But where's Cousin Itt?
- There you are, you little rascal.
- So sweet of you to join us, Itt.
Oh, but don't thank us.
What would a snail-hunt be without you?
You attract them.
Isn't Mama coming?
She's going to stay home with the children.
Teaching them to make cobwebs.
The games.
Good work, Lurch.
The family that plays together stays together.
Put them in the trunk please, Lurch.
- Can I turn on the radio?
- By all means.
I'll try to get music to go snail-hunting by.
Dear Itt.
It's his favorite music.
Radio needs fixing.
We interrupt this program for a special announcement.
An unidentified space aircraft has been reported over the Cemetery Ridge area.
Hey, that's our area.
This is an unconfirmed report from MSO, Mysterious Space Objects Headquarters.
There is no cause for alarm and residents of the area are urged not to panic.
We now return you to Harpsichord Reverie.
Hey, maybe they're Martians.
Couldn't we stick around and find out?
Well, then it's settled.
We'll stay here and picnic right in our own backyard.
Hinckley, MSO.
You saw a flying object where?
I see.
Cemetery Ridge district.
Near what house?
The old Addams house?
Well, thank you very much, we'll look into it.
You know, that's the 14th call we've had on that Cemetery Ridge sighting.
- What do you think?
- Who knows?
How about it, Professor?
We are always sending spaceships up there.
One of these days somebody up there is going to send something down here.
You mark my words.
The professor is no fool.
Well, I wouldn't go that far, but he is dedicated.
Spending 20 years of his life trying to figure out what the Martians probably talk like.
You know, all this "ralamalabagata" talk may prove to be very valuable.
If those little green guys ever do land, somebody's gonna have to palaver with them.
I think we better get over to that Cemetery Ridge district and look around.
Right.
Oh, one more thing.
This may prove to be another false alarm.
But just in case it isn't, and you are captured, you know what you have to do.
- Eat the codebook.
- Roger.
Tish, that French.
You know what it does to me.
- So lovely, so tasty.
- You're just hungry, dear.
Well, what's for supper?
I could eat a horse.
Come, come, Fester, you had that for lunch.
Uncle Fester, be patient, we'll be dining soon.
Why don't you go over and chat with Lurch and Cousin Itt?
Oh, they're always talking politics.
Darling, it's almost time for my moonbath.
I'd take it easy, Morticia.
Pretty strong moon.
In fact, I'm gonna put on my moon hat.
- Well, that's very becoming, Uncle Fester.
- It's an original.
Darling, would you fix my chair for me?
Oh, thank you, darling.
We ought to be able to get an excellent moonburn tonight.
Gomez, darling, what would we do if a Martian did land right here?
We'd do what any red-blooded American would do.
Run.
True.
Gil.
Take a look over there.
Do you see what I see?
I see it but I don't believe it.
What do you think?
I think it's time we get in touch with headquarters.
- All right in there, querida?
- Yes, darling.
The moon was a bit strong.
I thought I'd filter its rays.
Oh, I wouldn't want you getting moonburn.
- Darling, you look just like Galileo.
- The astronomer?
No, Cousin Galileo.
He has a suit like that.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Right.
Earth and Mars are at their closest points tonight.
What do you think they're up to?
Whatever it is, I don't like it.
Itt, you should speak English.
Well, I guess you're right.
It is a silly language.
Now, let's see, Uranus transits Jupiter at exactly 12:32.
Wonderful.
Right on schedule.
Punch is ready.
- Punch?
- A big punch.
They're either getting ready to blow up the place or they're sending smoke signals.
Smoke signals to whom?
Who knows?
To other spaceships.
Maybe this is a rendezvous point.
Well, the boss man said to move in and investigate.
Yeah.
Darling, are those men staring at us?
Not us.
At you.
You're ravishing.
- Darling, please, it's early.
- Your watch is slow.
Hey, they're coming over.
They got such funny looks in their eyes.
They could be people from Mars.
Nonsense.
They're not little, they're not green, and they don't have things sticking out of their heads.
Itt's right.
They could be disguised.
Well, whoever they are, we must be neighborly.
We don't want them thinking we Earth people are snobs.
- Greetings.
- Hi.
We're from the MSO.
I mean the USO.
We do a lot of entertaining for the troops.
You know, singing, dancing.
Well, I'm glad you're Americans.
- Where are you folks from?
- Yonder.
Uncle Fester, why don't you get our friends some punch?
Coming up.
I like to relax on these outings.
- Do you gentlemen mind if I smoke?
- Go right ahead.
Punch?
Didn't you ever see anybody smoke before?
Everyone must be starved.
- Uncle Fester, get the hotplate.
- I got it right here.
- Plug it in, dear, plug it in.
- You ready, Fester?
- Yeah, what is it, AC or DC?
- AC.
I do hope you gentlemen like tongue of yak.
- Yak?
- Nice and fresh.
It costs a little more than the quick-frozen, but it's so much tastier.
Would you people excuse us a minute?
Yes, but hurry back, yak loses something when it's overdone.
- Plenty strange behavior.
- Yes.
They didn't even touch Lurch's punch.
Everything about us seems so strange to them.
I think Cousin Itt is right.
I believe they're from another planet.
I agree.
- You think it's possible?
- I think.
How do you like the way the little hairy one talked?
- Do you figure that was Martian?
- Not according to Professor Altshuler.
Maybe he's a retarded Martian.
Let's blow this clambake.
No!
One false move and who knows?
We're slave labor on Mars.
He's right again.
One false move and who knows?
We're slave labor on Mars.
This is a delicate situation.
We'd better play it by ear.
Oh dear, I do wish Cousin Grope was here.
He has three of them.
Folks, we've decided to level with you.
We're really not with the USO.
I knew it.
You didn't have any taps on your shoes.
- We know exactly who you are, too.
- We even speak your language.
Our language?
Gomez, dear, I think he's trying to tell you something.
Well, agamagabagagawhographa to you.
Excuse us.
Those two fellows are up to something.
- What are we going to do?
- There's only one thing to do.
Put them under lock and key.
We want you come with us.
- Oh, we couldn't do that.
- We insist.
Now look here We accept.
How nice.
I always say there's nothing like understanding between peoples.
Quick, the codebook.
- Oh, yeah, one of us has got to eat it.
- Bon appétit.
- Lurch, put the gentlemen in the love seat.
- Yes, Mrs. Addams.
You two gentlemen make yourselves comfortable, my wife and I have to feed some plants in the conservatory.
- But, Gomez, dear - Querida.
Oh, you may amuse yourselves with this.
- That's little Pugsley's ray gun.
- Ray gun?
Watch.
Dear Pugsley.
He's so handy with these things.
Have fun.
On second thought, we don't want any mishaps, do we?
I'll hang on to this.
Well, at least we're still on Earth.
Darling, aren't we being rude?
After all, the plants don't need feeding.
In fact, Cleopatra's on a diet.
It's merely a ruse, my dear.
We must engage in some counterintelligence.
- See what their game is.
- Oh, I do hope it's bridge.
- What do you say we get out of here?
- Yeah, we gotta get word to headquarters.
We were just looking around.
- See?
Trapped.
- Darling, that was truly inspirational.
That's what they said about old Blood and Thunder Addams at Shiloh.
- When he deserted?
- Turned traitor.
- How ghastly.
- Not at those prices.
Maybe we're just imagining all this.
Maybe they're This is just their way of acting friendly.
Maybe they're just a nice, odd It's all a question of strategic deployment of forces.
Darling, you're a natural born leader.
That's what they said about old Cannonball Addams at Bunker Hill.
Right before he turned traitor?
No, before he began firing at his own men.
Poor old Canny, absolutely lost without his glasses.
How about the window?
Out!
Gilbert, where are you?
I don't know!
Darling, I think we ought to call the authorities.
Capital idea!
Now let's see, whose jurisdiction would this come under?
- CID?
- No.
COD?
- USO?
- MSO!
Operator, get me the MSO.
MSO Headquarters.
I see.
You have a couple of Martians in your basement.
And how do you know they are Martians?
Oh, they spoke Martian.
And what did they say?
This is the Martians speaking.
Wait a minute, I'll be right there.
Don't go away.
You must Wait a minute, what is your name?
Where do you live?
Addams.
Right next to the cemetery.
It's a nice neighborhood.
A nice neighborhood?
What did I say?
You Martian?
Yes?
Shalom.
I come in peace.
Wait here.
- Operator.
- Hello?
Operator?
MSO Headquarters.
Emergency.
Please hurry.
Yes.
It's QPA.
The situation is worse than I thought.
The Martians have taken over the whole house.
Goodbye, Agnes.
Isn't that wonderful?
Just listen to the two of you chattering away.
What in the world are you saying?
I don't know about him, but I was bidding him welcome in Swahili.
- You both speak English?
- Well, of course we speak English.
After all, we are in America, Professor Altshuler.
Oh, yes, I know that, but How do you know my name?
Why wouldn't we know it?
We're the ones who called you.
Stop beating around the bush.
If you don't surrender, bluey!
"Bluey"?
Yeah, bluey.
I will show you.
Come and see here.
Look.
Mighty nice display, Altshuler.
It's good to know the government is on the alert.
Isn't that an awful lot of planes, though, just to arrest two little Martians in the basement?
In the basement?
Wait.
Let me handle the whole thing.
They may be violent.
I don't know.
We found them cooperative all the way.
Come along.
Well, old man, there's one of the rascals.
- Darling, where did we put the other one?
- Let me see.
- Oh, yes.
- Please be careful.
- But they are not Martians!
- Nonsense, they even speak Martian.
- They learnt it from me!
- Then you're Martian.
- Funny, you don't look it.
- Most certainly not.
Oh, for heaven's sake, what's the matter with you?
If they are not Martians and you are not Martians, what am I doing here?
That's an interesting point.
Why don't we all go outside and look around some more?
No, no, no.
I've had enough Martians for the whole day.
Oh, my goodness.
I forgot to call off the Plan X before we all get killed.
Good thinking.
- You can use this phone.
- Yes.
Hello?
Operator?
Yes, MSO Headquarters.
Mach schnell, please.
This is the silliest thing I've It's QPA.
Listen what I'm going to say now.
Cancel everything.
I repeat, cancel everything.
Yes, cancel Plan X, it's a false alarm!
Why, this Addams bunch is the simplest, ordinary everyday family.
Good man, Lurch.
The whole thing seems to have been too much for him.
Why, you space scientists.
You're all so delicately balanced.
Oh, gentlemen, excuse me.
According to this, we'll be on Mars in another three years.
Nonsense, Pugsley will be there long before that.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh, it's from the Air Force.
Isn't that sweet?
They are thanking us for our contribution to the nation's defense.
Due to us, Plan X was fully tested.
"From now on, there's no need for anyone to worry about a Martian invasion.
"The nation is ready".
By george, I think one of Pugsley's missiles went out of control.
No matter.
Plan X will take care of everything.
{END OF EPISODE 27}{START OF EPISODE 28}
Gomez, darling, I finally got it.
- That wonderful glint in your eye.
- Bravo, Morticia.
Bravo, Gomez.
That was a lovely cast, dear.
It's all in the snap of the wrist, my dear.
By george, I believe I really did snap it.
- Pick a card, Father.
Any card.
- Later, Son.
I believe I've got a nibble.
Yes, I'd say so.
Mother, you pick a card.
Play it, dear, the way you play the strings of my heart.
Tish, when you croon soft and low like that - Darling, I'm crooning about the fish.
- Oh, that.
- Mother, you didn't even look at it.
- Oh, I'm sorry, dear.
- It was the ace of diamonds.
- I'm supposed to tell you that.
Go play with Wednesday, sweetheart.
- Pick a card.
- Oh, you and your silly old card tricks.
They're all ace of diamonds.
See?
- Checkmate, Thing.
- Aw, heck.
Thing.
Thing.
Pick a card, Thing.
Any card.
Everybody tries to get in on the act.
Lurch, the net.
Steady Now!
I wondered what happened to that.
Strangest fish I ever saw.
- Darling, it's Mama's dress shoe.
- Ah.
So it is.
Still, it's the biggest thing I ever caught.
Two pounds if it's an ounce.
An indoor record.
Hi.
Where'd you come from?
I used to have a friend like you.
Gorgo.
Did he send you?
Yes, he did.
Do you like card tricks?
I got two of the same kind for my birthday.
Like it, huh?
Okay, it's yours.
I'd sure like to try this card trick on someone.
Uncle Fester!
I'll be right back.
"Next, pinch of gizzard from a wizard.
"Powdered bat's wings boiled in oil".
Pick a card, Uncle Fester.
Any card.
How many times have I told you?
Not while I'm conjuring.
Gee, I'm sorry.
Who are you going to conjure?
Oh, I don't know, it was a surprise package deal I got from my Spell-of-the-Month Club.
Look, if you don't mind, I'd like to get on with my conjuring, if you please?
"Tooth of unicorn.
"Twelve newt's eyes.
"Season to taste, and here's the surprise".
You all right, Pugsley?
I must have used stale newt's eyes.
Where are you, Pugsley?
Say, have you Pugsley?
Oh, boy, talk about a surprise.
Wait till I spread the word about this.
Morticia, Gomez!
Oh, boy!
Super Ape.
The Space Detective.
The Green A venger.
Mr. And Mrs. Addams, may I present your son, Pugsley.
Pugsley?
That?
- D-R-U-N-K.
- I tell you, it's true.
It happened I was running though a little black magic and one minute standing there was a fat little boy, and then, poof!
That.
Uncle Fester, I think you've been working too hard on your magic tricks.
Morticia, Fester may be right.
These are Pugsley's cards.
This is Pugsley's shirt.
I absolutely refuse to believe that that Gomez, look.
He has that same lovely low brow as you-know-who.
Yeah, and that same fine prehistoric jaw line.
Oh, it is Pugsley.
I'd know that voice anywhere.
Oh, Pugsley, my boy, what has Uncle Fester done to you?
No, don't get worried, Morticia.
I'll change him back if you want me to.
If we want you to.
If we want him to.
- We do want him to, don't we?
- Absolutely.
Pugsley promised me he'd water the crab grass, and he's not getting out of it so easily.
Don't look so downcast, old man.
It was an excellent job of conjuring.
He's a fine-Iooking chimp.
It was a nice spell, wasn't it?
- A regular tour de force.
- Tish That French ripples from your lips.
- It inflames me.
- Darling, please, not in front of our son.
Sorry, I got carried away.
- Well, I'll go back to my fishing.
- Darling.
Mama, guess what?
No time for riddles.
I'm cooking gopher goulash for dinner, and I'll tell you, it's more trouble than it's worth.
I can't find half the things I need.
Mama, look.
- Might be just the touch it needs.
- No!
Mama!
- That's Pugsley.
- Pugsley?
I thought there was a resemblance.
I cast a spell on him.
Beginner's luck, if you ask me.
There'll be no living with him from now on, I suppose.
Now, please don't dawdle in changing Pugsley back.
He has homework to do, too.
You might as well save your breath.
You heard your mother.
You've got work to do.
Now let's see.
Purée of aardvark.
No condemned prisoner ever ate a heartier meal.
Darling Gomez.
You'd better set another place for Pugsley.
Uncle Fester, I distinctly told you that I wanted Pugsley changed back.
I know, I tried, I tried, but Set another place.
Uncle Fester, whatever happened to that wonderful combination of magically proven ingredients?
Well, the powdered rhinoceros horn I'm using may have turned a little rancid.
Excuses, excuses.
Like I said before, beginner's luck.
Now, you're not being very kind, Mama.
Uncle Fester will change Pugsley back right after lunch, won't you, old boy?
You're darn right I will.
In fact, I'll do it right now.
No, no, Uncle Fester, I won't have you conjuring on an empty stomach.
After lunch.
Lurch, please give Pugsley his lunch.
A coconut.
Come on, Pugsley.
Now from here on in, all I want is complete silence.
It won't take long to change Pugsley back, will it, Uncle Fester?
Three shakes of a yak's tail.
"Viper's head.
"Tail of donkey.
"Pugsley's changed from boy to monkey.
"Down and up, through field and fen.
"Change, oh, change him back again".
- Pugsley!
- My boy.
Pugsley.
- Pugsley, speak to your mother.
- Allow me, querida.
Yes, dear.
Pugsley?
No, it can't be.
Pugsley has more hair.
Then where There you are.
You naughty little boy.
Teasing your Uncle Fester like that.
Now, you may as well know.
I have been in touch with the spirits.
Oh, well, a little drink now and then never hurt anyone.
The spirits of the astral plane, I'm talking about.
One of those champagne flights, eh, Fester?
Very funny.
All I can say is when this séance is over, a little boy will have been restored to a mother's yearning bosom.
A little boy monkey, you mean.
I'm getting certain hostile vibrations which I will try to ignore.
Now, if you will all please join hands.
Now, I'm gonna ask everyone to concentrate.
Concentrate.
Gomez, do you mind concentrating on something else just this once?
Sorry, Fester, force of habit.
Now concentrate.
Concentrate.
Oh, spirits of the astral plane, give us a sign.
Is Pugsley there?
Rap once for yes and twice for no.
And ask him if he's all right.
Your mother wants to know if you're all right.
Rap three times for yes and four times for no.
No, you better make that twice for yes and three times for no.
- Now, now, relax, everybody.
- Great going, Fester.
You're zeroing in on Pugsley.
Oh, my little boy, out there whistling in the dark somewhere.
Now everybody quiet down.
Is that you, Pugsley?
Whistle once and rap twice for yes.
Rap once and whistle three times for no.
Five raps?
What does that mean?
That means it's definitely Pugsley.
He never could count.
Oh, my little boy, rapping away in the dark somewhere.
Well, now, take it easy, Pugsley, old boy.
Are you all right?
Rap once and whistle twice for yes.
And rap twice and whistle three times for no.
- Help!
- It's him.
No doubt.
No one else puts so much into a screech.
Keep screeching, darling.
Uncle Fester's trying to pierce that nasty old astral veil.
A-OK, Pugsley, old boy.
We're reading you loud and clear.
Now listen, pal.
We want you to materialize back onto our astral plane.
Understand?
What kind of plane?
Stand clear, Thing.
- A message from Pugsley.
- Airmail.
But why didn't he come himself?
- He can't make it.
- Nonsense, my dear, it's nothing more - Great Scott!
This is serious.
- I knew it.
Tell me.
No, don't tell me.
Yes, do tell me.
I must know the worst.
The Green Avenger's being threatened by the Manusian Zarock's deadly zeta beam radiation.
The only form of energy that can penetrate his plastic screen.
Dear, I think he's trying to tell us something.
What is it, Thing?
Something we should know?
Is it smaller than a coffin?
Larger than a tsetse fly?
Is it the title of a song?
This is fun.
I mean it would be if Pugsley were here.
Is it someone we know?
How many syllables?
Two syllables.
Whom do we know with two syllables?
First syllable.
Sounds like Fight?
Fighting?
Fighter?
Pugilist.
Pug!
Pug, Pug Just doesn't seem to ring a bell.
This is a difficult one, isn't it?
Well, I'm trying to bring back Pugsley and you're playing games.
- That's it, Pugsley!
- By george, Morticia, you're right.
Pugsley, my boy, oh, my darling.
Am I glad to see you.
Looks like we've got twins.
Let there be dancing in the street.
Our son has been restored to us.
Thanks to our Uncle Uncle Fester?
Help!
Help!
Uncle Fester, we can hear you, but faintly.
Can you hear us?
Scream once for yes and twice for no.
Better make that one scream and two raps for no, and two screams and one whistle for yes.
Forget it.
By george, I was right.
My Great-Aunt Deliria was engaged to a chimpanzee.
Here they are.
- Lovely couple.
- Too bad he jilted her.
Too bad our little chimp had to go back to its owner.
It was nice, having him climb all over the place.
Uncle Fester hasn't stopped eating since he clawed his way out of that secret room.
Well, three days without food does tend to sharpen one's appetite.
I wonder if there are any other rooms we've forgotten about.
It's lovely.
What is it?
Wednesday claims she has a new boyfriend.
The Invisible Man's son, Woodrow.
The little minx.
They grow up before you know it.
Not only that, she made me promise to knit a pair of gloves for him, for his birthday.
Marvelous.
I'm sorry you can't stay for dinner, Woodrow.
Maybe next time.
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I wasn't looking where I was going.
Yes.
- Well, goodbye, Woodrow.
- Goodbye, Wednesday.
See you tomorrow.
I'd better get busy on these gloves.
{END OF EPISODE 28}{START OF EPISODE 29}
Oh, I love coming down to this old room.
Such charming mustiness.
In many ways the most attractive room in the house.
A regular treasure-trove of memories.
I'm sure we'll find 100 things down here to give to the charity bazaar.
Oh, Gomez, darling, look.
- Your wedding dress?
- Yes.
You're not giving this dress to the bazaar?
Of course not, darling.
It has a special sentimental value for me that no one else could ever appreciate.
Perhaps I'll give this lovely mirror.
Remember the day I cracked it?
Yes.
We had those seven wonderful years of good luck.
We couldn't part with that, of course.
Seems like everything down here is a priceless family heirloom.
Morticia, let's forget the bazaar.
They haven't even asked us to donate this year, anyway.
Yes, and I can't understand that.
Our old insurance man, Mr. Henson, is in charge this year, and he's been to our home.
He knows what lovely things we have.
Behaved very strangely the last time he was here.
Perhaps he's one of those people with no taste.
Last year, they auctioned off my stuffed vulture for 35 cents.
Your live one would've gotten much more.
I suppose we should just give junk, things we want to get rid of.
Excellent idea.
But, darling, that isn't the real spirit of giving.
We should give things of value, things we really cherish.
All right.
I'll give them my grandfather moose clock.
The least I can give is this beautiful old table.
But, Morticia, that's priceless.
The original flogging table used by Ivan the Terrible.
I know, dear, it hurts.
But that means it's right.
Just picture the addition it will make to someone's home.
As always, cara mia, you are right.
Darling, I'm going to call the bazaar headquarters and tell Mr. Henson that we're going to contribute after all.
I know he'll be thrilled.
No, no, no.
No more Addamses.
We already have too much.
Mr. Henson, we can never have enough charity.
Yes, we can.
Of course.
We welcome your donations, Mrs. Addams.
I'm dreadfully sorry we overlooked you.
I don't know how that happened.
Well, I do.
I deliberately passed them up.
Mr. Henson will be over with our truck.
Yes.
Goodbye, my dear.
In charitable work, we can't allow personal feelings to interfere.
All right.
All right, all right, I'll go.
But I'm taking our biggest, strongest truck driver with me.
That's fine.
And please, examine all this monstrous junk they contribute very carefully.
And if you come across a shrunken head, look closely.
It may be mine.
Isn't it exciting, darling?
The whole family is getting into the spirit of giving.
Excellent character building, especially for the children.
The most important thing is that we're all giving the things we cherish the most.
Look.
Look what Mama just donated.
That's giving with real pain.
Her old friend Dr. Livingstone.
You're setting a shining example for us all, dear.
I'm donating Mary Queen of Scots.
Darling, that is your most precious possession.
I can chop a head off another doll.
I know, but not all the heads come off as nicely as this one.
Are you sure you want to donate Mary?
Yes, but I'll never be able to look her head in the eye again.
Uncle Fester, I haven't picked up your donation yet.
Charity begins at home, you know.
Would you mind turning this just a little bit?
I'm trying to get rid of a headache.
That's so soothing.
Uncle Fester, I'm ashamed of you.
Even little Pugsley has given generously.
Not his favorite wolf's head clock!
No, but he has given his toads and his lizards and his Gila monster.
And you know how he loves them.
I think the least you could do is give that old suit of armor.
No, not my suit of armor, please.
I need it to feel secure.
Like Pugsley needs his wolf head clock.
That armor is the only place I can find to hide in to take my afternoon's nap.
Uncle Fester, the whole family has given until it hurts.
Well, I like to hurt as much as anybody, but don't ask me to give my armor up.
I have to wear it practically every day to scare off those neighborhood kids.
They annoy you?
Not me, but they keep waving sticks and throwing stones at my new pet falcon, and he's getting a nervous stomach.
Uncle Fester, that bird is simply going to have to learn the difference between a gopher and a cocker spaniel.
Morticia, please, not this armor.
They're not making suits like that anymore.
Look at the cut of that pasguard.
And the hang of the jambeau.
It even came with two pair of cuisses.
You can keep the extra pair of cuisse and wear it with a matching coat of mail.
Make a nice sports outfit.
Let's get it all nicely polished up.
Mr. Henson will be here shortly.
Morticia may send this to the bazaar, but I'm going to make sure it comes back.
Pretty clever, huh?
I'm glad you agree with me.
Here you are, Cleopatra, some nice, fresh walrus burger.
Darling, come along.
Eat.
Cleopatra?
Oh, Lurch.
I've decided to give the baby strangler to the bazaar.
Taking it away from its m-a-m-a?
Yes, the baby's been weaned for several months now.
Would you put the baby in the sack, while I cover the mother?
She'd carry on terribly if she knew.
You can polish Pugsley's shoes later.
Now, Cleopatra Quick.
Put it in the sack and take it in the living room with the other things.
Oh, darling, don't carry on so.
Oh, yes.
Oh, you know, don't you?
You have a mother's intuition.
But we must all give till it hurts.
You're sick.
What've you been eating?
Or whom?
Pugsley!
Pugsley.
What did you do with Pugsley?
You murderer.
You get three good meals a day.
Out with him.
Out with him!
There's no need for you to eat between meals.
Cough him up.
I've heard of biting the hand that feeds you, but this is too much.
Pugsley!
Pugsley!
- You want me, Father?
- I hear you, Pugsley.
Keep talking, boy.
I'll find you.
Pugsley.
Pugsley!
Thank heaven you were indigestible.
Thank you, Thing.
Stuck.
Unstuck.
We've come to pick up the donations for the charity bazaar.
Follow me.
It's all right.
He's really a nice fellow.
Yeah?
He looks like parts of three nice fellows.
Oh, Mr. Henson, how nice to see you again.
How do you do, Mrs. Addams?
This is Jason, our truck driver.
Charmed.
I do have a lovely collection for you.
- Surprised?
- Not a bit.
Mr. Jason, you may start loading these things.
Lurch will help you.
Would you gentlemen excuse me?
Henson, good to see you.
Well, we certainly outdid ourselves this year.
- So I see.
- Have you seen the clock - I'm giving you folks?
- Does it explode?
Certainly not.
I wouldn't tamper with a valuable old timepiece like that.
Come here.
- How about that?
- How about that?
Well, it looks like The rear end of a moose?
You have a very discerning eye, Henson.
Ever seen any moose ends like that?
Definitely not.
At least it's just not a plain old head staring down at you.
No, those are so common.
Is it trying to get through the wall, or back out?
It's a clock, Henson.
The tail switches on the half hour, and goes all the way around on the hour.
Henson.
A rare and valuable clock.
You really mustn't part with it, Mr. Addams.
It's We mustn't deprive you of it.
It's much too lovely.
Exactly what I was thinking.
Besides, it would be a shame to deprive Pierre of the choice view that he's had for over 50 years.
After all, how many other mooses are lucky enough to see themselves as others see them?
Besides, an ordinary man wouldn't appreciate a collector's item like that.
Little Pugsley has an amusing conventional clock up in his room.
I'm sure he'd be glad to donate it to charity.
I'll run right up and get it.
- You all right, Mr. Henson?
- You tell me.
Henson, here we are.
Just a simple child's timepiece.
It's a variation on the cuckoo clock.
Watch.
- Wonderful, isn't it?
- What do you feed it?
Feed a clock?
You're pulling my leg, Henson.
I'll be interested to see what it brings at auction.
Yes.
Who knows?
Someone may just be furnishing a nursery.
A nursery.
Perfect.
Why all that gay, toe-tapping music?
What's the celebration?
I thought a little light music might bring Pugsley out of his depression.
Great Scott, he's not still up the chimney?
He's been up there for hours.
He says he's never coming down.
Well, I imagine it is nice up there, at that.
You know he's sulking because you gave his wolf's head clock to the bazaar.
I know.
I should have asked his permission first, but I was so sure he'd want to donate it.
He says it's the only thing he's really ever loved.
The lad should learn that if you give till it hurts, it's fun.
I know, dear, but you try.
I'm exhausted.
Pugsley, what do you say we visit the zoo?
You can see a live wolf's head there.
Really pretty.
Darling, this may be a traumatic experience for him.
Perhaps we'd better try and get the clock back.
Nonsense.
Some of the finest men in the Addams family have been shaped by childhood traumas.
Still, it tears at my heart to think I've alienated my son.
Well, darling, perhaps we can get Uncle Fester to make him a new wolf's head clock with bigger and better fangs.
By the way, where is Fester?
I haven't seen him since yesterday.
Oh, dear, I do hope he hasn't gone into one of his trances.
The last one went on for five days.
I thought he was a goner.
Dear Uncle Fester, he does love to play dead.
Matter of fact, I haven't seen Thing since yesterday, either.
Don't worry, Thing can handle himself.
Well, I'm gonna have one last try with Pugsley.
I tell you what, Pugsley boy That does it.
I've just got to repair this tragic rift somehow.
You rang?
Yes, Lurch.
I'm going to the bazaar and get Pugsley's clock back.
I can't bear to see him and his father separated over such a silly thing.
Oh, dear, I do hope the bazaar people will give it back.
- Buy it back?
- That's a marvelous idea, Lurch.
Oh, but don't tell Mr. Addams.
I want it to be a surprise.
Yes, Mrs. Addams.
Still looking for bargains, eh, Mr. Clayton?
Well, the auction will start in about an hour.
Well, nothing very exciting.
Oh?
What are you hiding back in that screen up there?
Those must be the things the Addams family donated.
- I don't know why Mr. Henson hid them.
- Let's have a look.
Well - Mr. Henson.
- Don't be absurd.
- The chin's much too strong.
- Well, thank you.
Excuse me, Mr. Clayton.
Now, ladies and gentlemen, these are real conversation pieces.
I direct your particular attention to the scrollwork.
- Now, how much am I bid?
- $10.
Sold.
The value of some of these things may not be apparent to the naked eye but if you look real close Well, I wouldn't advise that either.
Anyway, let's get on with it.
And now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to this rather unique collection of items.
Let's first see what we have here.
Yes, oh.
There's always one practical joker at every bazaar.
And now we come to this truly rare little number.
Anyone care to offer anything for it?
Anything at all?
$10.
Did I hear $10?
- Going, going - $20.
gone.
$20?
Oh.
Perhaps you can't see it clearly.
$30?
$40.
$50.
$50?
For this?
- $60?
- $70.
Perhaps you'd like to come up here, where you can examine it more closely.
Awfully spirited bidding for a worthless piece of junk.
I think Henson's up to something.
$100.
$100 Well, I must say, you are a very charitable group.
- 200.
- 300.
Dollars?
Do I hear a five?
Yes, the gentleman here in the front row says 500 Would anyone else care to bid $500?
I'll give $1,000.
Morticia.
I'll give $1,100.
Is that all?
- Darling.
- Querida.
Very well, sold!
To the gentleman over there for $1,100.
I love you.
Pugsley, darling, please.
We tried.
Won't you come down and talk it over?
Come on down, Pugsley, lad.
Darling, I don't think he should stay up there much longer.
He might learn to love it.
That's the way it went with Cousin Slosh.
Down the city sewer in a fit of pique.
Completely disowned the family.
Made a whole new life for himself.
Well, at least the bazaar people were happy.
They never made so much money before.
I still say we didn't get a fair chance at the bidding.
Mr. Henson closed it so fast.
But he's such a fragile man.
Nothing but raw nerves.
We were lucky to get Thing back on the first bid.
Well, I know Uncle Fester's happy.
Nobody bought his armor.
Lots of people were interested but I discouraged them.
Will you help me out of this thing?
Somebody spilled pink lemonade all over me and I'm all stuck up.
- I'll take a blowtorch to you later, Fester.
- A blowtorch will roast me.
Nonsense, the heat will put a nice crease in your cuisse.
What are we going to do about Pugsley?
Lurch, wonderful.
Pugsley!
Pugsley!
Here's your clock!
Oh, boy.
Thanks, Dad.
And how in the world did you ever get it away from Mr. Clayton?
Did he sell it back to you?
Gave me $5 to take it.
Gomez, darling, it's been a long and difficult day.
- It's time to retire.
- You're right, my dear.
I'm trying to synchronize these clocks.
Pugsley complained that his was off three seconds.
Probably got shaken up.
Some people just don't know how to handle delicate timepieces.
I think this ought to do it.
Oh, dear.
The poor thing's not well.
Never fear, the old clockmaker is near.
I think I'll try this one first.
Perfect synchronization.
{END OF EPISODE 29}{START OF EPISODE 30}
Oh, you tempestuous Latins.
I think you made me drop a stitch.
I'm sure Cousin Plato wouldn't mind.
- What are you fashioning for the lad?
- A ski cap.
- Do you think he'll like it?
- How could he help it?
When you block it, remember old Plato's left head is size six and his right one is eight and three quarters.
Yes, it does give him a lovely tilt.
- Uncle Fester, dear, is something wrong?
- Plenty.
What's the matter, old man?
Every time you come back from town, you're not your usual sunny self.
That ex-insurance man of ours.
- Commissioner Henson?
- Yeah.
Well, he's ruining our city.
He's putting fresh paint on all the public buildings.
- Whatever for?
- To hide the soot.
Cover up But the soot's the only thing that's giving those buildings character.
And not only that, they're putting in a new freeway.
A freeway?
Through our fair city?
You know, it's things like that that make you stop and think.
I'll be up in my closet, thinking.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
Oh!
It's from the City Hall.
I wonder what they're doing writing to us?
Well, this is the time they select the man of the year.
I suppose I'll have to resign myself to another giddy round of speechmaking and chicken a la king.
Darling, I'm afraid this isn't an invitation to become the man of the year.
What is it?
It's a condemnation of our property and eviction notice.
You're joshing.
It seems the new freeway is coming right through our living room.
Won't that crowd us a bit?
Fear not, querida mía.
No city in its right mind would want to ruin this fine old mansion.
This notice was obviously sent in error.
I'm sure you're right, darling.
Reminds me, dear.
Better get that hole in the ceiling fixed.
Come on now, Cleopatra, darling, you must eat something.
Look, this nice lamb chop will put the color back in your leaves.
Oh, darling, there's no need to pout.
Just because Lurch put on a blue patty instead of a nice pink one.
- Gomez, darling, is that you?
- No.
I'm in here contemplating.
Darling, I hate to interrupt your Zen-Yogi, but Don't talk, darling.
Just stand there and let me look at you.
You were never lovelier.
And you're so handsome, darling.
With the blue blood of Spanish aristocracy rushing to your cranium.
Gomez, did you hear an explosion a moment ago?
Oh, that.
Probably Uncle Fester down in the basement testing for gas leaks with a lighted match.
Oh, I suppose you're right.
There goes another one.
My goodness, I do hope he doesn't blow himself up.
I hope not.
He's wearing my best socks.
But que será será.
That reminds me, dear.
We got another letter from the City.
- And guess what?
- What, querida, what?
Thing tore it up.
That Thing.
Always on his toes.
I think we'd better call the gas company.
Gomez, I wish you'd stop making that racket.
You got my new crocodile so nervous he started chasing his tail and he rolled right out the window.
We didn't make that noise, Fester.
We thought it was you.
Testing for gas leaks.
It must be Pugsley.
Can't be Pugsley.
He and Wednesday are out hunting toadstools.
This is very baffling.
That last explosion shook the whole neighborhood.
Well, here's our next customer.
I feel guilty getting paid for this one.
You're right, chief.
Getting rid of a monstrosity like the old Addams house comes under the heading of sheer pleasure.
Well, that highway commissioner of ours might not be the greatest brain in the world, but deliberately routing the freeway through here is a stroke of genius.
You're not kidding, chief.
Next time he runs, I'm gonna vote for him.
Twice.
I'll match you to see who pushes the plunger.
Thing!
I saw him with a gun this morning.
Thing.
Thing?
Thing?
Have you been shooting your gun?
Hold on.
Let me see the gun.
I can tell if it's been fired just by smelling it.
Just as I thought.
Are you sure, Fester?
Thing has never lied before.
Besides, all those loud noises couldn't possibly be made by such a small gun.
Oh, no?
Well, hold on to your hat.
I still think Thing This is getting irksome.
Just when I had the decor arranged so perfectly, too.
Oh, I like it this way.
It's kind of lived in.
Uncle Fester, dear, there's such a thing as too much informality.
Now we're getting closer.
Well, they said it couldn't be done, but I did it.
- Did what, Mama?
- Invented artificial thunder.
- Didn't you hear it?
- You mean you produced those blasts?
I always knew that all I had to do was rub these sticks together hard enough.
Hey!
Why don't we patent it and form a corporation?
Capital idea, Fester!
Who'll buy thunder?
Oh, forget it.
Mama, would you grace us with an on-the-spot demonstration?
Well, try and stop me, but stand back.
We'll need six sticks of dynamite for the entrance here.
Better make it eight sticks.
We wanna blow this dump so high that you'II Sir, what is the meaning of this intrusion?
Don't bother with the small talk.
I'll shoot him in the back.
Would you mind turning around, please?
Certainly not.
I'll thank you to stand still.
Uncle Fester, please.
Fester, this man may be a trespasser and a saboteur, but he is our guest.
Saboteur?
What are you talking about?
I'm just following orders.
Orders?
Do you suppose he's an enemy agent?
If you expect mercy, young man, you'd better come clean.
What country are you working for?
I don't work for any country.
I work for the City.
Blowing people to bits?
It must be a civil service job.
Wait a minute.
What are you people doing here?
- Didn't you get a notice to vacate?
- Notice?
You don't expect us to take that absurd notice seriously?
That ridiculous missive was an insult to one's intelligence.
I'll shoot him in the back.
Uncle Fester, please.
We do not go around shooting people in the back.
- The side?
- A fair fight or nothing.
Okay.
Nothing.
You take this message back to your superior.
Tell him if he wants to build a freeway through our lovely home, he'll have to blow us up first.
That is, he'll have to make other plans.
- You rang?
- Show the gentleman out.
Well, that's that.
And despite your position as commissioner, I hereby warn you that any further trespass by your hired vandals will be resisted to the utmost.
Commissioner, if you don't mind, I'll wait out here.
As you wish.
But I assure you, Arthur J. Henson can handle a dozen Addamses.
Well, a half dozen.
PS, I always knew you were a corrupt, hypocritical old windbag.
I do hope he doesn't take that last part personally.
How could he?
His Honor, the Commissioner.
I'm sure he's come to offer his apologies.
I guess the hypocritical old windbag isn't such a bad fellow after all.
You can cancel that letter, Thing.
Addams, what is the meaning of this?
The City sent you a check for this property.
- Your apology is accepted.
- My And here you are, disregarding official notices, obstructing a man in his duties, actually threatening a City employee.
Thing, you'd better uncrumple that letter.
Sir, your attitude is hardly apt to get our votes at the next election.
Having trouble with our saboteur again?
Say, you've gained weight.
Fester, this is a different man.
Aren't you Henson?
We're surrounded!
Uncle Fester, please, put the gun away.
All right, go ahead.
Coddle him.
See here, you can't fight this.
The City is well within its rights.
I give you just 24 hours to vacate these premises.
Thing, please.
Remember your breeding.
My dear, don't be too hard on Thing.
After all, this is his home, too.
He was trying to defend it.
You mean to tell me that, that thing understood what I was talking about?
You certainly made it plain enough.
Well, enough of this nonsense.
Remember, 24 hours.
You cannot stop the wheels of progress.
Thank you.
Well, if the City wants a fight, they'll find me ready with the old corpus delicti.
Good thing I kept my old law library around.
Let's see here.
Property Rights From Magna Carta to the Present.
What luck.
I'd completely forgotten that I'd converted Property Rights into a humidor.
I thought Lurch was filching my cigars.
We're off to a fine start.
A victory before we've even opened the case.
Darling, that reminds me.
Wear it.
It'll be very appropriate.
The wig of Lord Chief Justice Sir Anthony Cliveden Addams.
No, Lady Abigail Cliveden Addams.
Oh.
I see you're still sticking pins in the Commissioner.
Well, we can't take this thing lying down.
- Attention, everyone.
- Darling, you've found something?
I have gone through the city ordinances, the Bill of Rights and the 17 volumes of assorted jurisprudence, and I have come to a conclusion.
- What?
- We haven't got a leg to stand on.
- Not even if we bribe the judge?
- Uncle Fester!
- The jury?
- Out of the question.
Well, you can't win 'em all.
They're blasting tomorrow whether we're in the house or not.
Oh, dear, and we're such late sleepers.
Hey.
Why don't we just move this house to another spot?
Uncle Fester, that's a brilliant idea!
- Old man, you've done it again.
- I have?
I know just the spot.
That lot Hornsby has up for sale.
That's right next door to the Commissioner's house.
My dear, at a time like this we can't afford to be choosy.
It's not that, but that lot doesn't have any caves, and then no quicksand, no swamp.
Fester, what's a swamp?
A bunch of mud, slime and stench.
We'll build our own.
Thank you, Thing.
Hello, Hornsby?
Addams here.
How much do you want for that lot?
$9,750?
Why don't we make it $10,000 even?
I hate to write checks for odd amounts.
Good, then it's a deal.
Well, the property is ours.
I'll bet you could have gotten him to take $11,000.
It pains me to do the Commissioner such a good turn.
The prices in that area will probably skyrocket as soon as word leaks out.
Now, darling, there's no sense in bearing grudges.
Why don't we call the Commissioner and Mrs. Henson and tell them to come over and hear the good news?
Capital idea!
The good neighbor policy.
Wait here.
Arthur, let's get out of here.
Now, please, Phoebe, with victory in sight, don't start rocking the boat.
I don't want to rock the boat, I want to get off.
Look, they are moving.
With any luck, to outer Mongolia.
I'd even pay their fare.
One way.
Oh, welcome.
Come on, dear.
Good evening, Commissioner Henson.
How are you?
Mrs. Henson, I presume?
- Yes.
- This is Mrs. Addams.
- How do you do?
- How do you do?
So nice of you to come.
Won't you step in, please?
And do be seated.
I was just telling Arthur.
Your home, it's so you.
Oh, how sweet of you to notice.
- Darling, do ring for Lurch.
- Yes!
Thank you, Lurch.
Tea?
Salt, pepper, or cyanide?
Neither.
Thank you, darling.
But you've never tasted Morticia's tea.
She picks the tiny, delicate wolfbane leaves herself.
Addams, I must say, you're taking this eviction like a good sport.
Well, nobody could say that an Addams stood in the way of progress.
Although I must admit Uncle Fester is a bit upset.
Yes, you see, there are no caves or swamps on our new property.
But we do have plans for building our own.
That is, if our neighbors don't object.
Any man who would object to having a swamp right next to his home is a petty individual indeed.
Glad to hear you say that, Commissioner.
We love animals and we're planning a mud wallow for our hippopotamus.
Arthur and I just adore animals, too.
Neighbor.
No, no.
I mean, you're not going to move in next to - To us?
- Right smack.
Gomez, darling, when are the men going to start moving the house?
Soon as I finish battening down these fine old heirlooms, we're off.
My dear, you should wear goggles.
This house gets awfully windy when it hits the open road.
I think I'll like that.
- Seatbelts.
- The only way to ride.
Where are the children, dear?
They're fine.
They're riding on the roof.
I do hope they don't get carsick.
- Is Lurch with them?
- Oh, no.
He likes to ride with his head out the window and growl at the passing cars.
Oh, boy.
This is gonna be fun, looking out the window.
- Thing.
Where's Thing?
- Up in the mover's truck.
- In the mover's truck?
- In the glove compartment.
Dear, sensible Thing.
Hang on, everybody.
All right.
Mush!
- Hey, this is more fun than the trailer.
- I love to see the sights.
I wonder what those people are staring at.
Well, they probably never saw a stately mansion rounding the corner on two wheels before.
- They've stopped.
- Probably picking up some hitchhikers.
Well, fancy that.
The City Commissioner hitchhiking.
Sit down, old man.
I'm sorry we have no more seatbelts.
I didn't come for any ride.
Well, it might do you some good.
You look like you've been run through a meat grinder.
Worse.
I mean, I've been up all night with the City Council and we've Well, that is, I've finally persuaded them to reroute the new freeway.
You don't have to move after all.
That's rather disappointing.
I was so looking forward to having you and Mrs. Henson as neighbors.
Mrs. Henson is heartsick.
- Into each life some rain must fall.
- Yes.
And about that lot you're stuck with.
I'm willing to take it off your hands.
Isn't he sweet?
Salt of the earth.
But we couldn't let you do it.
We'll find some use for it.
We could use it for a launching pad.
Little Pugsley makes the coolest rockets.
It'd be a wonderful place for me to practice my bagpipes.
Dear Mama.
She spends half the night tootling away on those things.
Too bad she doesn't know how to play 'em.
I insist.
I'll see that you get back your $10,000.
Nonsense.
- $11,000!
- Please, you're embarrassing us.
- $12,000?
- But really $15,000.
I beg you.
$15,000.
Well, we'll have to return the favor sometime.
Well, I'm not in the habit of accepting charity, Mr. Commissioner, but in your case I'll make an exception.
It's yours for $15,000.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
You'll have my check first thing in the morning.
Now I'll go and tell the movers to turn around.
Well, that won't be necessary.
Just tell him to throw it into reverse.
$5,000 profit.
Not a bad day's work, huh?
I think we can all learn a valuable lesson from this.
You never lose by being a good neighbor.
Dear Thing.
He's such a homebody.
Strange that the City Council should finally send the freeway straight through the mayor's house.
- Was he upset?
- No, he said he was happy.
- Considering what might have happened.
- "Might have happened"?
Oh, he probably means the moving of this classic structure from its natural surroundings.
It's a pity.
He did seem so eager about that swamp we were going to build.
Oh, well.
C'est la vie.
That's French!
Good shot, darling!
Must be the mating season.
{END OF EPISODE 30}{START OF EPISODE 31}
Gomez, darling, don't move.
Not a muscle.
I've finally captured the real, the inner you.
Paint, querida, paint.
This is for posterity.
Well, it's happened.
Bolt of lightning knocked you out of your tree house?
Oh, no!
It couldn't be.
He just bought a new lightning rod at the discount house.
I can handle lightning, but this is worse.
Uncle Fester, you haven't been drafted for military service?
They're taking our finest young men.
Now, don't worry, Fester, we'll find you a deferment.
Cowardice.
This is a letter from my pen pal, Madelyn, in Paris.
- France?
- IIlinois.
I didn't know you had a pen pal in Illinois.
Well, it wasn't my idea.
But she got this letter to my pen pal Madeline, in Paris, France, by mistake, and from then on she was hooked.
You do write a zingy letter.
Too zingy.
She's coming here to visit me.
Marvelous.
We'll have the guest room unbolted.
But pen pals are supposed to write, not visit.
Uncle Fester, is there something you're not telling us?
Fess up, Fester.
Have your letters led this innocent girl down the postal garden path?
Well, I did kind of smear it on a little bit.
Oh, well, it's normal to exaggerate in romance.
Yeah, but she said she imagined me as the Cary Grant type.
What's Cary Grant got that you haven't?
Hair.
You do have a little problem there.
There's a few other things I told her, too.
Like what?
Like I was an All-American football player, and a boxer, and a polo player.
I think she kind of likes that athletic type.
You did go out on a limb a little bit, but I think I have the solution for you.
What?
Leave town.
Nonsense, darling, he'll do no such thing.
You're going to stay right here and welcome her like a true Addams.
She'll be delighted when she sees you.
- She won't even get the chance.
- Where are you going, Uncle Fester?
Well, there must be some place where a baldheaded man can hole up.
Tish, would you like me if I had no hair?
It might be fun polishing your scalp.
Wait right here.
I'll run upstairs and shave it all off.
No, no, darling.
We mustn't think of ourselves now.
We must think of Uncle Fester.
We'll take direct action.
Thank you, Thing.
Let's see.
Gymnasiums, gypsies, hairpieces.
By george, Morticia, you've done it again.
With a hairpiece, Fester will knock her dead.
I don't think we want to go that far, darling.
Querida, we can't call anyone now.
It's night, all the stores are closed.
Oh.
Not Max's Hair Salon.
Look.
"If you want a wig, dark or light, "call on Max, day or night".
Good rhythm.
I'll just use his emergency night number.
We'll tell him it's urgent.
Yes?
I must be in the wrong house.
Please!
Max.
Oh, it's so good of you to come.
Allow me, Max.
Right this way.
We're really in quite a bit of trouble.
We'd like something nice for our Uncle Fester.
Something sporty, that'll take a few years off him.
Perhaps 20 or 30.
Madam, I am not a magician.
I can only cover his head.
He'll have to cream his own wrinkles.
That's fair enough.
May we see a few samples?
You mean without the client being present?
Oh, we wouldn't dream of having Uncle Fester model before a stranger.
He's much too shy.
Besides, he's off somewhere brooding about his ladylove.
Oh, he's got it bad.
Love seems to bring out the beast in him.
Oh, you mean Kitty.
Kitty cat doesn't need a hairpiece.
Never met a lion who did.
Lion?
In this house?
How else are the children going to learn anything about nature?
They can't wait until pet day at school.
I think I'd Oh-oh.
I think I'd better come back tomorrow.
Nonsense, old man.
As long as you're here, let's have a look at the merchandise.
You rang?
Lurch, a mirror, please.
Mr. Max, we're ready whenever you are.
All right, I'll try on a few.
Morticia, you be the judge.
Lurch, you hold the mirror.
You're going to use that mirror?
Naturally.
But it's cracked!
Of course.
Cousin Droop dropped it for luck.
Well, if that's what you want.
Here is a nice model.
We call it banker's gray.
Distinguished but youthful.
I'll try that.
Thank you.
- Darling, what do you think?
- For you, darling, it's perfect.
But I don't think Uncle Fester's the banker type.
All right, do you have anything more Ivy League?
Uh-uh.
No, sir.
- But perhaps you'd like the Mohawk.
- Oh, we'll try that.
Darling, what do you think?
I think we're getting closer.
All Fester needs is the middle part.
He's got the rest of it.
That's true.
But I still don't think it will do, darling.
It would be all right if his pen pal were Pocahontas.
Don't worry, I've got more.
This one needs a little combing.
My comb.
Oh, that's very thoughtful, Thing.
Yes, thank you Hello, Kitty.
That's a compliment to you, Mr. Max.
Kitty doesn't come down for just everyone.
Thank you and goodbye!
Goodbye!
What about your toupees?
Keep them!
"Keep them".
How generous.
Darling, have you noticed how people take to Uncle Fester?
Especially the ones who've never met him.
Uncle Fester, now you stop squirming.
Morticia, I don't wanna wear a wig.
Nonsense, when you're wooing a girl, you have to make sacrifices.
But I'm not wooing her, she's wooing me.
All right, then you'll both have to make sacrifices.
Now, turn around and let's see how that looks.
That's not me.
Well, it is a bit Rudolph Valentino.
But don't worry, we'll find something that will do you justice.
Oh, you look great in that one, Fester.
Excuse me.
Darling, that isn't Uncle Fester.
This is Uncle Fester.
Oh, by george, the spitting image of Cousin Bleak, the time the boll weevils got in his hair.
Uncle Fester, go over to the large mirror.
You can get a better view.
- Well, what do you think?
- Fat.
Fine if you like the short, tall, fat, skinny type.
Nonsense, Uncle Fester, you're much too self-critical.
Why, with your basic good looks and charm, you could sweep Madelyn off her feet in any one of these.
Get with it, old man.
Exude confidence!
That's easy for you to say.
You don't have to wear a mop on your head.
Perhaps you're right.
Let's see.
Let's try this one.
Hey, that's more like it.
Well, it does sort of give you that Madison Avenue look.
Yeah, it's more my type.
Come in, come in.
- A visitor.
- Who is it, Lurch?
Pen pal.
Madelyn!
She mustn't see me like this.
Come on, Fester, that poor girl's down there panting for you.
She's not panting for me.
She's panting for that tall, dark, handsome athlete I told her I was, but ain't.
Uncle Fester, turn around.
Come, come.
Now who is that?
That's General Ulysses S. Addams.
- And what did he do at Vicksburg?
- He surrendered.
Not until they caught up with him.
And that same brave blood courses through your veins.
Hey, you know, you're right.
- I shouldn't let a girl frighten me.
- Not until you're married.
Gomez and I will welcome Madelyn.
You come downstairs as soon as you have your hair fixed.
After all, the poor girl has come all the way from Paris, Illinois.
Well, if I'm not down in five minutes, I'll be on my way to Paris, France.
Welcome to the Addams house.
It's so nice to see you.
You can't imagine what a thrill it is to meet Fester's parents.
- Parents?
Are they around?
- Darling, I believe she means us.
We're not exactly Uncle Fester's parents, but we do try to help him keep his things in order.
Especially his lightbulb and his bats.
Bats?
He told me he was athletic.
And he has quite a head on his shoulders.
Quite.
You'll find him fascinating, Miss Smith.
Madelyn Cavendish Beauregard Faversham Firestone Smith.
- That's all one person?
- Oh, no, no.
Five.
They were my ex-husbands.
Were they pen pals, too?
Only Mr. Faversham.
The rest were shipboard romances.
Battleship.
Where is that big, strong, lovable Fester?
Fester!
- Oh, dear, I do believe he's gone to France.
- Nonsense.
Here's your dream man now.
Howdy!
- This is the cutest house.
- We do our best to cute it up.
And that's the cutest decoration.
Oh, that isn't a decoration, that was Cousin Squint.
It's all we could save.
You're cute.
Darling, I'm afraid we made a bad investment.
In Consolidated Dust?
In Uncle Fester's toupee.
We made him much too attractive.
It does seem to have brought out the Don Juan in him.
In her, too.
Do you realize that that woman has had five husbands?
- Shows enterprise.
- Enterprise?
Nonsense.
- She's probably just a fickle coquette.
- Coquette.
That's French.
Speak some more, Tish.
Creme de menthe, savoir faire, Brigitte Bardot, anything.
- Not so loud, they'll hear you.
- Ah, yes, where were we?
On Madelyn's five husbands.
- I checked into them.
They all died.
- Mysteriously?
Not at all.
Suicide.
Darling, we have to break it up for Uncle Fester's sake.
- Morticia, do we have the right?
- Of course not.
- But I'm still worried.
- About what, querida?
Uncle Fester's such a copycat.
Shall we Shall we sit on the loveseat?
Why not?
This is This is so intime.
Madelyn, when you speak French you make my blood boil.
Speak some more!
Hasta la vista.
Skal!
Gesundheit!
Anything.
You men have such a low boiling point.
Oh, you mad, impetuous boy, let me run my fingers through your hair.
- No, no.
Watch it.
The glue's still wet.
- Glue?
That's what I call my pomade.
Well, got to do my workout.
You rang?
Lurch, my tackling dummy.
When a man loses his head over a woman, it's a tragic thing to watch.
Don't worry, Uncle Fester won't lose his head, just his hair.
The dummy.
Right over there, Lurch.
- Now don't get too excited.
- Be careful.
Fearless Fester?
- Oh, darling!
Oh, darling!
- I'm all right, Coach.
You were magnificent.
Oh, say it in French.
Oh, that does it!
- You know what I like about you?
- What?
You're different.
You're the first one to ever notice.
He reminds me of someone.
- Cousin Itt?
- That's the one.
- Why don't we fly away?
- Elope?
I can't wait to become Mrs What is your last name, anyway?
You know, you're the first one that ever asked that.
Never mind, never mind.
We'll leave it Smith.
That way we won't have to change the monograms on the towels.
Oh, goody.
- Darling, I'm worried.
- About what?
Uncle Fester and Madelyn.
I think those two are in love.
- With whom?
- With each other.
Impossible.
No, it's not at all impossible, darling.
According to their horoscopes it's perfect.
She's a Capricorn and he's a bachelor.
By george, you're right.
We may have to accept her in the family.
Not only accept her.
We may have to welcome her into the family.
Make sure that she's anxious to marry Uncle Fester if she has any doubts.
Doubts?
About a catch like Fester?
True.
He has dazzled her.
But I want her to realize that he's beautiful on the inside, too.
He is.
I've seen his x-ray.
By george, that's one I've never made before.
Dear, I do hope Madelyn doesn't wear that raccoon coat to the wedding.
We'll have her wear something nice in black.
Querida, you've been practicing.
So you two children are going to elope.
How quaint.
You modern kids certainly are impetuous.
Once you've found happiness, why wait?
Oh, he's so cute.
Well, if you're going to elope, you'll need a ring.
Oh, it's beautiful.
- What is it?
- It's a gopher's tooth.
It was Grandmother Frump's.
Well, I better go upstairs to get ready.
He's so cute.
Yes, but there's a lot more to Fester than his good looks.
Sit down, my dear.
We'd like to tell you a few little things about Uncle Fester, and how to make him happy.
Tell me everything.
Well, for one thing, he likes to keep charged up.
You mean he drinks?
Oh, heavens, no.
Uncle Fester is electrical.
Oh, that.
Electrical?
He lights up.
Now, for newlyweds that can be a real saving on electric bills.
I guess so.
And of course you know the way to a man's heart.
Just speak French.
Gomez, darling, I was thinking about cooking.
You'll want to know some of Uncle Fester's favorite recipes.
French pastry?
Oh, no, no.
Simple things like eye of newt.
Newt?
Aren't they those little crawly things?
Not after you cook them.
And when he's had a nice, home-cooked meal, Uncle Fester likes to relax up in his tree house.
Tree house?
Be sure you pick a honeymoon cottage with a tall tree.
All clear below!
Here comes the groom!
Well, hop on.
Let's hit the road.
Get lost, you electrical, tree-sitting newt!
- Did I do something wrong?
- You got born, baldy.
I told you it wouldn't work.
It's just as well, Uncle Fester.
A woman who doesn't know how to make a man happy certainly wouldn't make a good wife.
Besides, her French was atrocious.
Well, who cares?
I could have never gone through life with that itchy wig.
That's a lovely attitude, Uncle Fester.
Someday you'll find the right kind of woman.
A woman with just your kind of tastes, just your kind of interests, and just your kind of head.
Now take your time, my dear.
Aim carefully.
That was pretty close, Morticia.
Watch it.
Don't worry, Fester, Annie Oakley Addams never misses.
Well, almost never.
I'm getting out of here.
Dear Uncle Fester.
He just hasn't been the same ever since that woman jilted him.
Well, the whole thing is obvious to me.
She just didn't like motorcycles.
Dear Uncle Fester.
He loves his so.
Not anymore.
He's taken up horseback riding.
- Horseback riding?
- Look.
Tally-ho!
So much more sensible.
{END OF EPISODE 31}{START OF EPISODE 32}
Thank you, thank you.
And thank you, Lurch.
And, Lurch, would you mind taking the children up to the tower?
Mama's waiting for them.
She wants to play pinochle.
Oh, goody.
- Wasn't Morticia marvelous, Cousin Itt?
- He's asleep, dear.
- How can you tell?
- I can hear him snoring.
Come.
We've entertained some pretty cold audiences.
But at least they didn't fall asleep.
They had the decency to walk out.
Poor Cousin Itt is troubled, darling.
He hasn't been sleeping well lately.
I think he has a problem.
Problem?
But he's got everything.
A brilliant mind, a charming personality.
And he's a great dresser.
That's true.
But he can't seem to find a place for himself.
A career that would do him justice.
Cousin Itt would make a great undercover agent.
- Special Agent 298.
- No.
Darling, Cousin Itt is probably bored by beautiful women.
Let's wake him up.
Cousin Itt.
Oh, I'm sorry, dear, I didn't mean to interrupt your dream.
Something exciting, old man?
That is exciting.
Zooming through the air in one of those jets.
Dreaming you were the pilot, eh?
- The stewardess?
- He is mixed up.
Of course, dear.
Go to your room and finish your dream.
Tell us how it comes out.
Darling, we must think of a way to help Cousin Itt.
We'd better.
He's threatening to go to the South Seas and become a beachcomber.
We can't let that happen.
He'd never get the sand out of his hair.
But we simply can't let a fine human being like that think he's a failure.
Might drive him into doing something rash.
Darling, what about music?
He could become a rock and roll singer.
Nobody would understand a word he was saying.
No, Cousin Itt's a longhair.
Well, then, what about the violin?
He could even make his own bows.
But I'd miss him so when he goes on those long concert tours.
Oh, he is a lovable little rascal.
Such a brilliant conversationalist.
Voilá!
I have it.
Tish, that's French.
Darling, please.
Let me tell you my idea.
- Let me tell you mine.
- Later, dear, later.
- Right now I want to talk about Cousin Itt.
- Yes, where were we?
I have the perfect career for Cousin Itt.
- Marriage counselor.
- Isn't he a bit inexperienced?
So is the hangman till his first job.
The hangman.
Perhaps No, Itt's more the marriage counselor type.
That's true.
You rang?
Yes.
Lurch, please go wake up Cousin Itt.
He's embarking on a new career, marriage counselor.
You see.
We're on the right track.
Darling.
A stewardess?
Sorry.
Downstairs to discuss your future.
A stewardess.
Why, marriage counseling should be right up your alley.
Nonsense, you're the perfect type.
Oh, no, Itt.
You have to be a girl to be a stewardess.
It is not unfair.
That's just the way things are.
Besides, I'll prove to you that you'd be a good marriage counselor.
Gomez and I will pretend to be a married couple with a problem.
And we'll come to you for counseling.
Far-fetched, but we'll go though with the charade.
Will you do it, Itt?
Good.
Inside you're all heart.
Quite a combination.
Inside all heart.
Outside all hair.
Cousin Itt, step down to the desk, please.
Right this way.
Here we are.
Maybe we should put a telephone book under him.
No.
I think he should look at these problems from his own viewpoint.
Right.
All right, Doctor, you're open for business.
Good afternoon, Dr. Itt.
We're a young married couple and we have a problem.
What do you mean you're too busy to see us?
We need help.
Henry.
Henry and I have been married for three days and already he isn't paying any attention to me.
Well, no wonder, you haven't been out of hair curlers since the ceremony.
Why should I?
All you ever do is look at that silly newspaper.
I don't just look at the paper.
I study the stock market.
That's a laugh.
You study the stock market and you don't have a penny to your name.
No wonder I don't have a penny.
You spend it before I earn it.
Tish, when you laugh it drives me wild.
Darling, please.
We're two other people.
Oh, yes.
My mother always told me you were a tightwad.
I'll tell you how much I give her.
Plus carfare.
She's nothing but a spendthrift.
And I mean it.
Do you, Gomez, really?
Of course not.
There was something in your voice.
Maybe way down deep inside you do think I'm wasteful.
- Oh, Gomez.
- Tish When you cry, it sets my whole being aflame.
No.
You just think I'm a plaything.
And a delightful one, eh, Itt?
Right, right.
One man's meat is another man's poison!
That does it.
I didn't say it.
Itt did.
- I'm going to my room.
- I'll go with you.
No, thank you, I'd rather be alone.
I'm going to finish reading War and Peace.
- What page are you on?
- Twelve.
Bigmouth.
It's Gomez.
Passionflower.
What will Mama and the children think?
Let me in.
Morticia, everyone's in bed except me.
Fine thing.
Just 'cause you two have a little spat us innocents have to suffer.
I'm sorry, Uncle Fester.
But my sensibilities have been wounded.
Nonsense, Cousin Itt.
It isn't your fault because Mr. Addams let his temper run away with him.
Me?
Loving father and tender husband?
Temper?
I give up.
Morticia!
That French again.
Forgive me, cara mia.
I've been a cad and a fool.
No, darling.
Just a cad.
I've been a fool.
Sending you out in your bare feet without a thought of your sinuses.
You're right.
We'd better get out of here before this thing gets out of hand.
Querida, let's fly away together.
A second honeymoon.
Darling, we've already had a second honeymoon.
Then we'll have a third, a fourth and a fifth.
Darling, we must think about Cousin Itt.
Oh, yes.
Where were we?
Obviously being a marriage counselor isn't his cup of tea.
Perhaps his cup of tea is failure.
That's what they used to say about old Cornelius Addams.
And they were right.
But not about Cousin Itt.
He's different.
So he is.
What can we do?
What do we always do when we have an insurmountable problem?
- Give up.
- Not always.
- This time we'll call an expert.
- An expert.
Where can we find one?
- In the phone book.
- Good thinking.
Thing?
There we are.
"Vampires.
Vikings.
Vocational guidance".
Thank you, Thing.
Here's one.
Mortimer Phelps.
Oh, I remember him.
He's the one that helped Cousin Trivia get a career after she got out of the wax.
- WACs?
The army?
- The museum.
But does he really know about jobs?
How to make good at them?
He should.
He had hundreds before he became a vocational expert.
Sounds like our man.
I I Goodbye.
On second thought, I'll stay.
Follow me.
Careful, that's imported feathers.
Mr. Phelps.
Mr. Phelps.
Addams here.
This is Mrs. Addams.
Good of you to rush over.
You said it was an emergency.
We didn't really expect you to have to stay the night, though.
These are merely the tools of my trade.
Nowadays vocational guidance is an exact science.
Oh, good.
Then you won't have any trouble finding the exact position for Cousin Itt.
Cousin Itt?
From whose side of the family?
He's from both sides of the family.
He hasn't quite found himself.
And with Cousin Itt that's not easy.
He looks the same from every angle.
Well, that's the kind of a challenge I like.
In my profession we have one motto, "There's a place for everybody".
- What was that?
- That's Cousin Itt.
I know.
You're wondering why such an attractive young man would have any trouble finding employment.
Now, obviously he'd be no good at basketball.
He hasn't got the stamina.
Darling, we mustn't prejudice Mr. Phelps.
Let him make up his own mind.
But just on a first impression, where would you say that Cousin Itt belongs?
In a mattress.
You don't need a vocational counselor, what you need is a veterinarian.
No, I don't think that would do.
Cousin Itt doesn't like animal husbandry.
Don't rush off, old man.
Remember your motto, "A place for everyone".
Everyone, not everything.
This project's impossible.
- There isn't enough time or money.
- Money is no object.
Money is Well, then, let's Let's try.
Send him in.
Good.
Cousin Itt, darling, come here.
Someone wants to meet you.
- Is he human?
- To a fault.
He'd give you the hair right off his back.
Now first we'll try the perception and coordination test.
Now, the object is to get these blocks together as quickly as possible.
Looks simple.
No, darling, I don't think that's really quite I think this is the way it goes.
Oh, dear, why don't they give instructions with these things?
Would you mind letting the subject try it?
Not at all.
No, Cousin Itt.
It is not a game.
Would you mind doing that again slowly?
I've never been able to get these things together.
It's amazing, isn't it?
So that's how it's done.
Yellow one goes Well, let's try something a little more advanced, the Rorschach tests.
By george, I've seen that somewhere before.
Well, of course, they're the Rorschach inkblots.
I have it.
Morticia's inkblot.
That Rorschach did have a touch.
Please?
Now tell me what you see.
That's obvious, it's the ancient fertility dance.
- Gomez.
- Modern fertility dance?
They're not dancing.
By george, you're right.
It's a bathtub.
Please.
We're trying to test Cousin Itt.
Now what do you see?
A bunch of bananas?
Oh, the poor dear.
The poor dear is right.
That's what Rorschach says it is.
I still say it's a bathtub.
Now think carefully.
What is this?
He says it's a slaughterhouse in Chicago.
Robins singing?
Sunrise over Phoenix?
Moon over Miami?
Why, it's amazing.
He got every one of them right.
Now let's test his imagination.
Now, I'll say a word, and you say whatever word pops into your mind.
- Bird.
- Vulture.
- Molting.
- Mating.
- Nesting.
- Billing.
- Cooing.
- Lips.
- Red.
- Kiss me.
Please!
I will not tolerate any more interruptions.
Really, old man, you don't understand true love when you see it.
Darling Gomez, Mr. Phelps is right.
Itt now.
Us later.
Thank you.
Now if we're all ready Black.
- Love.
- Frustrated.
Mr. Addams, please let the young man answer for himself.
Love.
Dry.
Good glory, I can understand him.
Of course.
All you have to do is get used to his accent.
Look at the two of them, chatting away in perfect understanding.
It's heartening, isn't it?
Perhaps the United Nations will work.
How long has Phelps been in there?
Oh, he's been evaluating that data for over three hours now.
- This is nerve-wracking.
- I can't stand it.
Poor Cousin Itt.
He's so nervous, he went up in the tree house with Uncle Fester.
I hope a passing eagle doesn't snatch him up.
Oh, dear, he would make good nesting material, wouldn't he?
How long's this gonna take?
Cousin Itt's getting so nervous he's starting to stutter.
Patience.
You can't hurry science.
After all, Madame Curie didn't invent the cotton gin in minutes.
- Friends - Well, old man, what's the verdict?
Only once in a lifetime does a case like this come along.
Now, you may not realize it, but Cousin Itt is no ordinary person.
Of course not.
He's got an IQ of 320, and that's without his shoes on.
This young man could be a nuclear physicist, an outstanding general, a brilliant surgeon.
Wonderful idea.
He could operate without stooping.
Once he got you open he could look right in.
But there is always the one perfect career.
And for Cousin Itt, with his great compassion and sense of human understanding, that one perfect career is marriage counselor.
You rang?
Lurch, show this quack the door.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
Morticia, we'll have to stop calling in these incompetent experts.
You're so right, darling.
I don't know how he ever got in the phone book.
Oh, but that's a marvelous idea.
- Going to the South Sea Islands to paint.
- Of course, all Itt'll have to do is jump in the paint bucket and roll around on the canvas.
Very colorful.
Both his work and he.
Rather careless of old Phelps to leave his testing blocks behind.
- He did seem to be in a hurry, didn't he?
- Yes.
Well, I think I've got it down pat now.
- Give me a fast count to 10 and I'll try it.
- All right, dear.
- One, two, three - That's it, got it.
Are you sure?
It looks a little different.
So it does.
Well, poor Cousin Itt must have gotten it wrong.
Now I'll count and you try it.
No, darling.
One genius in the family is enough.
Mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
- It's from Cousin Itt in Pango Pango.
- How's he getting along?
Beautifully.
He's the official tourist guide, showing the people the interesting sights.
As a matter of fact, he's become the most interesting sight himself.
He certainly must have won a place in their hearts.
They have his picture on a postage stamp.
Dear Cousin Itt.
Someday he'll become a collector's item.
- He is already.
- Mommy, Daddy.
- Yes, Wednesday, what is it, darling?
- May I play with the blocks?
Well, of course, dear.
Here, help yourself.
- I think that's a little closer to it.
- Really?
Gomez, darling, don't be jealous.
There is room in the family for one and a half geniuses.
{END OF EPISODE 32}{START OF EPISODE 33}
Now, now, Cleopatra, no gulping.
Masticate, masticate.
- Regular little glutton today.
- She does love her giraffe burger.
And that dinner music.
Lurch!
He's been stabbed!
Nonsense, darling, that's the way he sings.
He'd be better stabbed.
- You know, I think Lurch has talent.
- For dancing and juggling?
No, for folk singing.
They all sound like that on our TV.
- Must be out of order.
- No, I had the repairman check it.
They're doing that on all the shows now.
Singery, swingery, flingery.
- What happened to all the doctors?
- Well, they're singing, too.
I do believe Lurch could become a recording star.
By Jove, you may be right.
I'll get the phone book, look up some record companies.
- Lurch will be so surprised.
- Lf they like him, so will I. Will you stop bothering me, Addams?
I told you I'm not interested in making records of singing butlers.
I only handle standard groups like The Polecats, The Zombies and The Headsplitters.
Wait a minute.
That voice.
Is that him?
Well, he does have a bit of a cold.
Hang on.
Gladys, dig this sound.
Hey!
That gets me.
Bickle?
Are you still there?
Yes, I'm still here and I'll be right there.
- Wild!
- When he sings he's beautiful!
He does have talent, doesn't he?
I'm gonna make this guy the biggest thing in the music business.
He's already the biggest thing in the butler business.
Show him, Lurch.
Stand up.
Oh, he is a big one.
And still growing.
He'll sweep the country.
Not so fast, Bickle.
He hasn't swept the kitchen yet.
Darling, country first, kitchen later.
Grab your hat, boy, we're gonna go down to the studio and cut some records.
Oh, no.
I'm afraid dear Lurch is much too shy.
You just forget about it, Lurch.
- I'm sorry you came out here for nothing.
- For nothing?
Just a moment, my dear, this is the sort of thing Lurch needs.
He's too inhibited.
This will bring out his true personality.
You see?
The mere thought of it has him bubbling.
Well, it's all settled, Bickle.
You bring your recording equipment over after supper.
You've got a deal.
And you're gonna fracture 'em, pal.
My, that sounds attractive.
Mr. Bickle's almost finished, dear.
Last time I was this nervous, you had twins.
I never had twins, darling.
- You didn't?
- No.
I must have been dreaming.
Darling, you are nervous.
Perhaps a little fencing will make you relax.
Dear.
- En garde.
- Tish.
That French.
It goes right through me.
They're through recording.
Be right with you.
- Darling, what are you doing?
- Marking my place.
This guy is dynamite.
He'll be bigger than The Beagles.
- The Beagles?
- They're very tasty.
Those are bagels.
The Bagels?
That's a great group, too.
Well, gotta get going.
Take care, Lurchy baby.
My, isn't she the motherly one?
- Your voice is beautiful, Lurch.
- But I'd do a little work on my aim.
Sorry.
Watusi!
You forgot the Freddy.
Oh, my two favorite dances.
The Freddy and the mazurka.
- This is where he lives.
- Real cool pad.
Joan, Susie!
- This is Lurch's place.
- Oh, crazy!
Such soothing music.
That was the voice of Benny Bickle's hot new find, Lurch.
And now Well, Lurch, with a talent like that, you ought to be a shoo-in as king of the butler's ball.
Lurch, you go and practice, and that's an order.
Hey, sounds like an accident.
Great shades of Satan!
A lynch mob!
Nonsense.
Lurch wasn't that bad.
They're in an ugly mood.
But I'm ready for them.
Battle stations, everyone.
Man the guns.
Pass the ammunition.
No, no, no, Gomez.
It's not a lynch mob.
Look, dear, it's Lurch's fans.
Isn't that sweet?
They really love you, Lurch.
Work.
Isn't he splendid?
So devoted to his job.
The perfect servant.
Remind me to give him a raise.
Better still, I'll buy one of his records.
We want Lurch!
We want Lurch!
We want Lurch!
We want Lurch!
We want Lurch!
Practice.
All right, now.
Eye on the ball.
Darling, suppose I miss the ball and hit you?
Counts as a stroke.
Helps develop accuracy.
Very clever.
A hole in one!
What a lovely sport.
After lunch we'll try it blindfolded.
Yes, it does make you work up an appetite, doesn't it?
I'll ring for Lurch and have him fix lunch.
Darling, what in the world could have happened to Lurch?
That bell is a bit difficult to hear.
We'd better go down to the kitchen.
Observe the professional touch.
By george, a club in one.
Now, "Fillet of fenny snake, In the cauldron boil and bake".
Fillet of fenny snake.
Fenny snake.
We're always out of staples.
Well, I guess I'll just have to use some chopped eel.
Get away, Thing.
Make your own lunch.
Uncle Fester, have you seen - What are you doing?
- I'm fixing my lunch, what else?
A fine butler we've got.
I rang and I rang but he didn't answer.
I'm starving.
That looks very tasty.
It's a recipe I found in a book.
Let's see.
"Fillet of fenny snake in a cauldron boil and bake.
"Eye of newt and toe of frog, "wool of bat and pollywog".
Stop, stop, you're making me hungry.
Uncle Fester, this isn't a cookbook.
That's the witches' scene from Macbeth.
Hey, that Shakespeare was a real gourmet, wasn't he?
Lurch should be fixing lunch.
It isn't like him to neglect his duties like this.
He hasn't answered anybody's ring for hours.
- Maybe he just quit and walked out.
- Oh, he wouldn't do that.
Not without taking his references.
Gomez, we'd better look for the poor dear and try and help him.
Let's look in the playroom.
While I was gabbing the whole thing's gone flat.
- Oh, there you are.
- Where have you been, Lurch?
Playroom.
Practicing.
He didn't want to disturb us.
Isn't that thoughtful?
Well, it'd be more thoughtful if you practiced in the kitchen.
But, darling, you're the one who told him to practice.
Very well.
Put the blame on me.
My shoulders are broad.
At least they are in this suit.
Mr. Bickle says Lurch is breaking records.
I prefer a butler who breaks dishes.
Yes, Mr. Addams.
We are faced with a very serious problem, and there is only one thing we can do.
Worry.
- Oh, dear, I'm glad to see you're relaxing.
- Helps me worry.
Have you caught anything?
The last time you caught one of Mama's dress shoes.
- This time I caught the other one.
- Oh, that's good.
She does look better in a matching pair.
Oh, the mail's in.
Thank you, Thing.
I'm expecting an important letter from my banker, broker, taxman and barber.
Barber?
He's a wonderful banker, broker and taxman.
- I'll take them, my dear.
- Darling, they're all for Lurch.
- Lurch?
- Fan mail.
Oh, these are for me.
- Lurch?
- Lurch.
- Lurch?
- Lurch.
Well, no wonder there were none for me.
The postman didn't have enough room.
Come on, now.
That Lurch charm.
You know, this is for your fans.
Now, let's see those pretty dimples.
Perfect.
I can't see a thing in here.
Too dark.
That's better.
Now hold it.
Perfect.
Hey, that's a good one.
Came out nice and clear.
Only I don't think I captured the real you.
It's the real me.
I wonder what happened.
Great jumping catfish!
Consolidated Fuzz is down to three.
Oh, these pictures of Lurch are lovely.
Consolidated Fuzz has dropped from 278 to three and all you can talk about is Lurch?
I'm glad I don't own any Consolidated Fuzz.
- Lurch, the door.
- Lurch is busy resting.
That's ridiculous!
How can he expect to rest with me yelling for him every five minutes?
I'll handle the door.
But someone else will have to take care of the cleaning and the washing.
Lurch!
We wanna see Lurch!
- We gotta get his autograph!
- I'm sorry, but Lurch is not Here.
- What happened?
- Lurch is very big with fainters.
I'll go get some smelling salts.
Hurry up, I really need some.
There are no two ways about it.
Lurch's career is costing us a fortune in smelling salts.
His fans are rather delicate.
Frankly, Morticia, I'm sorry you ever pushed him into making those records.
I ever pushed him into making records!
Who was it called Mizzy Bickle in the first place?
- You.
- Oh, yes.
But who was it insisted they bring over the recording equipment?
Who was it insisted Lurch sing?
Who was it ordered him to practice?
That was me, too, wasn't it?
Well, since I'm the one who got us into this mess, I'm going to let you get us out.
You tell Lurch he has to choose between crooning and butling.
Oh, darling, I couldn't do that to dear Lurch.
You're the head of the family, Gomez, you tell him.
Am I supposed to do everything?
We'll do this the democratic way.
We'll vote on it.
Capital idea!
All those in favor of allowing Gomez to tell Lurch will say "Aye".
- Aye.
- Aye.
Aye.
It's unanimous.
But, I, I, I Three more ayes.
It's becoming a landslide.
Addams here.
Oh, yes, Bickle.
Tell Lurch what?
Really?
That's a great idea, Bickle.
Splendid.
Cara mia!
Our troubles are over.
We don't have to tell Lurch anything.
- He's leaving on a world tour.
- Leaving?
He's going to London, Paris, Brooklyn.
You rang?
Oh, excuse me, I wasn't expecting you.
Just passing by.
Mr. Bickle's going to take you on a tour of the world.
The The world?
Oh, come, come, Lurch.
You can show a little more enthusiasm than that.
No.
Voice gone!
Oh, the poor dear, the excitement must be too much for him.
He's really speechless.
Quickly, down to the playroom.
We must restore his voice.
Don't worry, Dr. Addams only lost one patient.
His first and his last.
Gomez, darling, I have an idea.
If he can't talk, he can't sing.
That solves everything.
- You're right.
- No, I'm not.
It must be a free choice.
Lurch must make his own choice between singing and butling.
All right, Lurch, say, "Ah".
Oh, that's right, I forgot.
You can't talk.
Querida, you'd better take a look at this.
- See anything?
- Nothing except a stick.
- Spray.
- Spray.
Spray.
It's no good, Fester, it didn't help a bit.
That's funny.
It cured the rose bushes just like that.
Uncle Fester, I don't believe Lurch has aphids.
No, nor scarabs, either, otherwise I would have seen them.
Lurch, try some of my old-fashioned remedy.
Don't spill it on the table, it takes the paint right off.
Now.
There, now, isn't that better?
Can you sing now?
I just got to pinpoint this trouble.
Pinpoint?
Why didn't you say so?
- Mama, what did you do?
- I pinpointed the trouble.
By george, I was right.
He's regained his voice.
Here he comes.
I won't go.
But, Lurch, dear, the world is waiting for you.
Your fans are out there drooling.
Yeah, and walking all over Morticia's thorns.
Don't worry about us.
Uncle Fester will pinch-hit until we find someone else.
Well, I better get down to the kitchen and prepare supper.
If anybody wants anything, just ring.
Oh, isn't that sweet?
An autographed picture.
Best picture you ever took, Lurch.
Doesn't look a thing like you.
Goodbye, Lurch.
Good luck.
Bye.
Well, he belongs to the ages now.
I'll miss his happy, smiling face.
I need a drink.
I'll ring for Fester.
You rang?
Lurch!
You're back!
To stay.
There's nothing like the sound of happy voices raised in song.
They are much happier now, aren't they, darling?
Now that Lurch is home to stay.
Darling, why isn't Lurch singing?
He has a perfectly lovely voice.
There are a few more fans hanging around outside.
We didn't want to take any chances.
Darling, you think of everything.
{END OF EPISODE 33}{START OF EPISODE 34}
It's all very simple, children.
All you need is 20/20 vision, nerves of steel, and absolutely perfect coordination.
Like this.
You also need an indomitable spirit.
That's the safe way to make a basket.
Once more.
- Oh, that was a nice toss, darling.
- Thank you.
Thank you, Lurch.
Querida!
Perfect.
Exactly the way I taught you.
And that's the way I want you to do it, too.
Children, we'll have another lesson tomorrow.
- You're a good teacher.
- Thank you, Father.
Cara mia, stop right there.
Oh, but darling, I must take this plant down to the playroom.
I don't see a plant.
I see a rare flower.
You.
- My lovely black orchid.
- Oh, Gomez, darling.
Your Castilian blood courses through your veins so gloriously.
Oh, that's terrible.
Morticia doesn't seem to think so.
No, I'm talking about this article.
"The Danger of a Happy Marriage" by Dr. Francois Chalon, the eminent psychologist.
- Danger?
In a happy marriage?
- You bet.
This fellow says that, "Married couples who seem ideally mated "and perfectly attuned are really miserable, emotional messes underneath".
Well, the poor things.
Not everyone can be as fortunate as we, cara mia.
Music, Lurch, to underscore this magic moment.
You just oughtta read this.
This Dr. Chalon is tops in his profession.
He says that couples who fight like cats and dogs are really the happy ones.
- Happy, cara mia?
- Ecstatic, cavaliere mio.
You are sick, sick, sick.
Darling, I'm worried.
Do you think there could be anything wrong with our marriage?
I couldn't be happier.
Querida, if our marriage is shaky, I want to keep it shaking for all eternity.
Your knight in shining armor will defend it against the world.
Oh, darling, something I've always wanted.
An indoor waterfall.
- You're so ingenious.
- That's true.
Well, off to the Zen-Yogi society.
We're doing our latest position, the spread eagle.
- On the floor?
- Midair.
Have fun.
I forgot my glasses.
- Who did that?
- Gomez.
- Deliberately?
- We were talking about our marriage and suddenly he picked up the spear and flung it.
You had a fight.
Congratulations.
Nonsense, Uncle Fester.
We've never been happier.
- You poor, misguided soul.
- But Please, you'll make me cry.
Come on, Lurch.
Tighter.
I just gotta get rid of this headache of mine.
Oh, forget it.
I'll never get rid of this headache.
You always said that thing was perfect for soothing your nerves.
How can I have soothed nerves when tragedy is about to strike - someone very near and dear to us?
- The octopus?
The moose?
Morticia and Gomez.
Gomez is beginning to crack already.
For no reason at all, he just practically wrecked the plumbing.
They're gonna really erupt one of these days and All over!
We gotta get them to fight, so they'll let off a little emotional steam.
- Then they'll kiss and make up, huh?
- Right.
You know, like a well-adjusted couple.
Now, all in favor of making Morticia and Gomez miserable for their own good, raise their hands.
It's unanimous.
- Please, not while I'm coughing.
- Sorry, Fester.
Morticia, my pet, did you make a slight rearrangement of the chessmen?
She probably knew she was beaten.
Darling, are you accusing me of fudging?
It's just an excuse.
He's trapped and he knows it.
Forgive me, angelito mío.
There, my king stalemates your king.
It's a draw.
Neither one of us wins.
Of course, darling, it had to be.
We're so perfectly matched.
We've just got to do what the professor says.
Get them brawling.
Hello?
Gomez Addams?
Who's calling?
Grand guru?
You must be the president of Gomez's Zen-Yogi society.
His dues?
Yeah, I'll tell him what he There aren't gonna be any dues, not this month's or any month's from now on.
Mrs. Addams talked her husband into quitting your phony society.
She says Zen-Yogi is a fake.
Yeah, she put him wise to you quacks!
Gomez will have a fit.
He loves Zen-Yogi.
Exactly.
And if he doesn't give Morticia a whack or two, how else is going to prove his undying love?
And if she cares for him she'll conk him once or twice.
What lovely fireworks.
They'll light up the whole sky with "I love you".
An ace.
My weekly game at the Zen-Yogi clubhouse is something I look forward to with a passion.
Imagine playing seven card lowball on your head.
I am Drashi Dumo, grand guru of the local Zen-Yogi society.
Follow me.
- The grand guru.
- Grand guru!
This is a surprise.
Mr. Addams, I am the one who is surprised.
In fact, I am deeply shocked.
Zen-Yogi is not a fraud.
It is nirvana.
It is the ultimate.
Well, of course it's the ultimate.
I might even say it goes beyond the ultimate.
Who would dare say it's a fraud?
Your wife, Mrs. Addams.
Yeah, your wife, Mrs. Addams.
She did?
Well, she's a very intelligent woman.
If her intuition tells her it's a fraud, then it must be a fraud.
Then you are quitting the society?
Morticia said that?
My darling querida.
Just trying to save me the embarrassment of telling you myself.
You're not gonna let her dictate to you, are you, Gomez?
You love Zen-Yogi.
After what has been said about Zen-Yogi in this house, we will never accept you again.
Good day.
Wait!
Tell him his wife's a meddler.
Let's get a little battle going here.
Darling, did I hear a strange voice?
Tish, Zen-Yogi's been taking up entirely too much of my life.
Darling, you're so right.
And besides, all this standing on your head is getting rather expensive.
- None of your hats fit anymore.
- It's more fun doing things together.
Darling, could this be the time we should take our safari up the Amazon?
Wonderful.
A second honeymoon.
- Darling.
- Cara.
Did you hear that?
I'm gonna have to take the most drastic step of all.
Now!
Today.
You're right.
We just can't let them go off alone.
Suppose they explode up the Amazon.
- Only one would come back alive.
- Which one?
I don't know.
And that's the worst part of it.
I just couldn't stand the suspense.
A gentleman to see you, Doctor.
I hope I can help you.
I read your article in a magazine.
Yes, a marriage problem.
Have you ever considered wearing a toupee?
Oh, it's not me, it's my niece and nephew.
They seem ideally mated.
Completely happy.
A potentially disastrous relationship.
I had five marriages of my own.
Each one ideal, and then Five marriages?
You must really understand women.
Naturally.
I've killed three men for women.
- Duels.
- Well, that's a nice pastime.
But you've just got to meet Morticia and Gomez.
As a friend of mine.
Not as a doctor.
So you can study and observe them, without letting them know.
You've just got to help them.
- Well, I'm afraid I'm a very busy man.
- Oh, please, please.
We can't let a beautiful woman like Morticia go through life as a Ionely divorcée.
Beautiful?
Well Never let it be said that Francois Chalon ever refused a lady in distress.
Oh, goody.
You're a school chum of dear Uncle Fester's?
- Yeah, that was correspondence school.
- How charming.
Oh, that French!
Even when he speaks it.
The French are so suave.
But the Castilian is much more exciting in his ardor.
Will you come and meet our Mama?
Mama, this is Dr. Chalon.
- Charmed.
- That's a most unusual ball of yarn - you're working with.
- Oh, it's a shrunken head.
I'm taking the hair off.
I'm going to crochet a nice tea cozy with it.
And this is my daughter, Wednesday.
Oh, what a pity!
Your little doll lost its head.
She hasn't lost it.
She's Marie Antoinette.
And I chopped it off.
Would you care for a cocktail before dinner, Dr. Chalon?
Yes, I think I could use one.
You rang?
Cocktails, Lurch.
Use the good hemlock.
- Shall we adjourn to the library?
- Yes.
So much more intime.
- Please, that's French.
- Darling, please.
We have a guest.
Oh, yes, forgive me.
Shall we?
I asked him here to solve a problem.
Now he's creating one.
That's just what we want.
We'll encourage it.
This is my darling Cleopatra.
Genus African strangler.
If I may say so, I find you fascinating, completely irresistible.
I believe you're trying to tell me something.
From the first moment I saw you, I was enchanted.
Dr. Chalon!
I believe Uncle Fester's school chums are always welcome here, but I think you're abusing our hospitality.
I happen to be married.
If you don't mind my saying so, I've made women forget their husbands in one day.
- Please, I love Gomez.
- Who's Gomez?
- My husband.
- You see, I've forgotten him already.
You'll recognize him when you see him again.
Fester, are you trying to accuse Morticia of flirting with Chalon?
All I can say is I'm sorry I ever invited him over.
Then I'll have to defend my honor, like a true Addams.
Well, spoken like a true Castilian nobleman.
- Let her have it.
- Mr. Addams.
- Your charming wife just - Sir, you have trifled with the sanctity of my marriage.
I demand satisfaction.
My card.
"Validated one-hour parking at Joe's".
Slight error.
Now, you may choose your weapons.
These rapiers.
In one hour.
This is all wrong.
You were supposed to sock Morticia.
My rapier shall speak for me.
Please turn the other cheek.
I only have two.
Gomez.
He's the best swordsman in all France.
He is?
For Morticia, my querida, I would fight the greatest swordsman in the world.
Oh, shucks.
Sorry, sir.
Poor Gomez.
If only he'd belted you once, everything would have been perfect.
That's no way for a man to treat the woman he loves.
That Chalon will slice him like a nickel baloney.
Oh, dear.
I must stop it.
But how?
He'll enjoy killing Gomez.
But Gomez won't enjoy it.
I had the most horrible dream.
I dreamed that you killed Chalon and the police came and took you away.
And Gomez, you're my favorite nephew.
I just couldn't bear it.
Please, you gotta call off that duel.
Don't be absurd.
If the police come I'll face them.
With shoulders back, head high, and say, "It was an accident".
Gee, Gomez, you know, with that sword in your hand - it's a thing of beauty.
- It's all in the wrists.
In the wrist, huh?
Please can I try it?
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.
Oh, dear.
And we don't have another.
Now you'll have to call the duel off.
Nonsense.
This is much better.
- Gomez, you said it was all in your wrist?
- Oh, yes.
Here, we got to keep it in shape.
Let me give it a little massage.
- Here, how's that feel?
- It's all right.
Yeah?
Better?
Well, yes, much better.
- But not for dueling.
- You mean you'll have to call it off?
Not while I still have this hand.
By george, I just realized it.
I'm left-handed.
Cousin Itt, I'm faced with a terrible problem, and I know you have a good head on your shoulders You do have shoulders, don't you?
Three?
Well.
Anyway, Gomez and a certain Dr. Chalon have become involved in a deadly duel over me.
There is a simple solution?
What?
A duel?
But they are going to fight a duel.
And Chalon's the best swordsman in France.
That's a very good suggestion, Cousin Itt.
But Gomez's insurance is already paid up.
How can I stop that duel?
I tried that.
He discovered he was left-handed.
That's very sweet of you, Cousin Itt.
But I believe Gomez has written his own eulogy.
Well, I'll just have to work on Dr. Chalon.
I must stop this duel for Gomez's sake, no matter what the price.
Thank you, Cousin Itt.
It's comforting to know that I look good in black.
Francois.
Please speak English.
It sets my blood afire.
Really?
Please come and sit beside me.
Francois, I don't want you to fight.
You might get killed.
Do not worry.
In three strokes you are a widow.
Dueling's for fools.
You must go away.
Only if you go with me.
I'd love to, but Gomez hates to travel.
- Who's Gomez?
- My darling husband.
What about darling me?
You must choose.
Well, I'd feel much better knowing you were far away, and safe.
Such charm.
But you do not have to choose.
I stay here and duel.
Well, then, duel with me.
I prefer to kill your darling Gomez.
- Oh, no!
- Such loyalty.
In a few minutes it will be "poof"!
All over.
- And then you can pack your things, yes?
- No.
I mean, I just remembered, I have to go feed Zelda.
- Let Zelda feed herself.
- Let a vulture feed herself?
You're not yourself.
Her husband hates to travel?
Chalon, you are a fool.
Dr. Chalon, you must call off the duel.
It's off.
Cowards only talk bravely.
That's true, but Gomez has other good qualities.
I was speaking of my cowardice.
I have a yellow streak that wide down my back.
Oh, is that so?
I thought you were wearing suspenders.
Well, it takes a brave man to admit he's a coward.
But what about Morticia and Gomez?
- Maybe if she slugged him - Not necessary.
They are truly a perfect couple.
He was willing to sacrifice himself for her, and just now, she It would have been such a beautiful sacrifice.
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.
All right, Chalon, this is it.
The moment of truth.
- Chalon left.
- He left?
You know those yellow suspenders he was wearing?
- Yes.
- They're not suspenders.
- Where's Francois?
- He ran.
Oh, good.
Didn't he leave any message?
What message was there to leave?
He was obviously frightened by my superior swordsmanship.
I may be a little rusty, but I still have what it takes.
Yes, darling, you still have it.
But I think I'm slipping.
Darling, I'm really glad you're back in the Zen-Yogi society.
Well, when I showed them this position, they welcomed me with open arms.
- It's a very interesting position.
- And so comfortable.
The grand guru couldn't wait to try it himself.
Yes, it's too bad he didn't have a stronger chandelier.
We should send him a get-well card.
- Lf it's not too late.
- No.
The hospital says he's recovering quite nicely.
Oh, dear, the grand guru is going to have company.
By george, that Zen-Yogi really does work.
My head never felt clearer.
Darling.
