{START OF EPISODE 1}
So, after I was indicted, my wife lost her job and had a nervous breakdown, and if that wasn't bad enough, one of our sons stole his brother's girlfriend, which made him run away from home and join the Army.
We don't even know where he is.
We've entered Afghani airspace.
Remember, pull the green cord before the light green cord.
We're just worried sick about him.
It's just that you feel so helpless, you know?
Look, I don't set the prices, mister.
They're four bucks a box.
Take it or leave it.
All right.
Just the Thin Mints.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.01 - Reese Comes Home Relecture par Tyno.
Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com It doesn't have to be tuna surprise.
It can be chicken surprise, or beef, but there will be a surprise involved.
You know, we can wait for Mom to make dinner.
I'm sorry, she went to talk with some Army administrator about Reese.
She'll be gone for hours.
Get your hands off me!
Your authority stops at my property line!
What did she do?
She completely destroyed an office, made explicit threats against the United States Army, attacked my groinage region and captured same.
Listen, maybe there's a way we can make this whole thing go away.
Sir, if she comes within 500 feet of my perimeter I've been given the authority to engage.
- Mom, what happened?
- I'll tell you what happened.
I told them how my underage son ran away and joined the Army under false pretenses and was sent off to combat and you know what they said?
They said if you can find out what name he used, they can have him back to us in six months.
Six months!
They'll have him back to us in six months.
I don't know if she's upset he's gonna get killed, or met someone else is gonna do it.
- Honey, you know you're gonna lose a nail inside your palm again.
just calm down and let the Army - I don't trust the Army, which means this family has to find him, and I don't trust this family, which means I have to find him.
- Two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star?
- And he blubbered like a baby.
The Army.
What do you expect of people who would give Reese a gun?
Oh, that's right.
It's the Army's fault if your brother gets killed.
Now, Lois, we can't blame Malcolm for stealing Reese's girl and causing this whole mess in the first place.
Kids his age are nothing but raging hormones and hideous self-involvement.
They are all amoral little creeps.
Don't defend him, Hal.
Just help me make dinner.
Great, "angry meat loaf".
Thanks a lot.
We don't have to worry about Reese.
All he has to do is lay low and not do anything stupid.
Oh, God.
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.
I'm a robot.
Robots are cool.
Green Lantern fought a robot.
I love Green Lantern.
I love pie.
Pie Pie Pie Why am I thinking about pie?
I'm supposed to be thinking about something else.
Does it rhyme with "pie"?
Buy?
Cry?
Die?
High?
Pie?
Pie!
Pie?
Green Lantern.
Fighting robot.
Fighting machine.
Me I'm a fighting machine.
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.
I'm a lean, mean fighting machine.
What is that?
I made a list of every bad thing Reese ever did to me.
A list?
I'm sick of having to defend myself!
No matter what I did to Reese, he's done way worse stuff to me, and it's all here on this list.
So we're admitting we have lists?
Mine starts January '95.
When does yours start?
October 3, 1996: my first knuckle pizza.
July 10, 1997: my first atomic swirly.
The big bruise of '99.
"Backyard Dentist", "Lighter Fluid Donut".
That's worse than stealing a girlfriend, right?
I don't know; were you in love for the first time with that donut?
Shut up, Dewey.
I had every right.
In fact, I owe him.
So you're saying if he dies, then you'll be even?
I didn't say he was going to die!
- Malcolm, he almost killed himself with Bisquick once.
- I'm just saying he deserves whatever he gets.
No, he doesn't.
That's something Reese would say.
I'm not Reese.
Just because he's horrible doesn't mean I have to be.
I'm better than that.
Wow, for a brother-killer, you sure are conceited.
Oh, uh, excuse me.
Hi, uh, Sergeant Rick.
I'm wondering if you can help me.
My son is underaged, and I think you may have recruited him.
Take a look.
- Oh, yeah, Private Jetson.
- Oh!
Yeah.
Well, let's see, uh He was sent to Fort Roberts.
I'll get you the address.
Oh, I really appreciate this.
I just don't understand what would make him go and do a crazy thing like this.
Well, the truth is is today's Army's a pretty attractive package.
Competitive salaries, health benefits, college tuition Lois, I didn't sign anything.
Just hear me out.
It's only two weekends a month, plus we might qualify for a housing allowance.
Okay, there's a slight possibility of active duty, but Sergeant Rick expects global events to stabilize in the next three months.
Excuse me?
!
What do you want?
I'm Malcolm.
I'm here Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 3:00 to 7:00.
No one volunteers here.
They're all signing up for the glamorous jobs at the burn unit.
I just want to do something to help veterans.
Really?
You think you can handle helping around here?
How 'bout trying to give Mr. Skoros a sponge bath?
Sure.
Or maybe you'd prefer to clip Mr. Deepmarth toenails.
Okay.
Or how 'bout going room to room emptying bed pans and stanching bed sores?
You know, I think I can save us both a little time here.
This is how I see it playing out: you're keep thinking of worse and worse jobs for me to do, and you know what?
I'm going to do them, all of them, no matter what.
Why?
It doesn't matter.
I have my reasons.
So go ahead, knock yourself out.
Well, it kind of takes some of the fun out of it, but okay.
You can start the afternoon enemas with Mr. Klegman.
It'll be my pleasure.
It's about my son, Reese.
Um, I think you know him as Private Jetson.
Private Jetson.
Ma'am, let me shake your hand.
That boy is oldier that this old dogface ever had the privilege of commanding.
I wish I had a hundred more just like him.
He's a fine boy.
Yes, well we think so, too.
I'd be proud to help you in any way that I can.
Now you just name it.
The problem is he joined under false pretenses.
He ran away; he's not even 18 years old yet.
We need to know where he is so we can find him and bring him back home.
I'm sorry, ma'am, I can't help you.
That's classified.
If your son were on a secret mission, which I'm not saying he is nor that one exists, it would compromise said mission if indeed there were one.
My hands are tied.
You know, Sergeant, you and I aren't so different.
I mean, if you think about it, we both have the same job.
Taking a bunch of mindless, irresponsible teenagers and turning them into something vaguely useful to the world.
It is a challenge, ma'am.
Last week, one of my boys was trying to iron his shirt while he was still in it.
One of mine interrupted a war game because his rifle was kind of digging into his shoulder.
- Did you make everyone suffer for what the one kid did?
- Of course.
But it never lasts, does it?
- It is stunning how much punishment they require.
- Tell me about it.
I'm amazed I get anything else done.
Did you ever try the opposite?
- What do you mean?
- Give one of them special privileges for no reason.
- How does that work?
- It's really pretty neat.
The others don't know why he got special privileges so they start doing everything right just to catch up.
Then the one you singled out starts getting suspicious and paranoid and he starts informing on the stragglers.
- That sounds pretty good.
- You mind if I steal that one?
- Yeah, be my guest.
You know another good one?
Let them pick punishments for each other.
It exercises their creativity and keeps them from ganging up on you.
- Nice.
- You can also take their breakfast, lunch and dinner, put it the blender and grind it up into a gray paste.
Eventually, they eat it.
That's kind of fun.
- You are an artist.
- No, I'm just a talented amateur.
I wish I could help you.
I wish I could just open this drawer up and show youthe information you need.
But I can't.
It's got me so frustrated that I just want to stare intently out this window for, oh, say - What is wrong with these guys?
They're just like zombies.
- It's the medication that makes them that way.
- Except for Kowalski.
I mean, he came to us like that.
- Look, I don't think you should be giving them so much.
I was reading to Donaldson for a half an hour, then a bee crawled out of his nose.
Believe me, it's better for everyone to keep these men as calm as possible.
Hey, Ed, you want to play?
Here we go.
You know what, Ed?
You can do this.
I believe in you, all right?
I'm here to help you, however long it takes.
Maybe you feel ignored here.
Maybe you feel like you don't exist.
I know you exist, Ed.
Let me help you.
Where have you been?
You've been gone all day.
You haven't called.
I've been worried sick about you.
Well, I have to eat, Lois.
- I'm a human being.
- I'm sorry I'm so late.
I had to take the bus home.
I sold the car.
I bought a plane ticket to Kabul.
There's $400 left.
- I'd give it to you to pay down the Visa bill, but I need it for bribes.
- What?
!
I'm gonna go get him.
- What are you talking about?
You can't just go get him.
- Yes, I can.
Tonight, I'm gonna buy enough frozen dinners to last you and the boys for three weeks.
Then tomorrow, I'm flying to Kabul.
If I don't get anywhere with the Army, I'll hire an interpreter and get the locals to help me.
If I have to, I'll make friends with a warlord.
Those guys are pretty organized.
I'll find him, Hal.
And when does the little bird pop out of your head and start singing?
This is what's happening, Hal.
Lois, you can't do this.
At some point, you have to check your ego and leave it to the professionals.
- I can't.
- Lois, you have this reckless, crazy belief in yourself that lets you do amazing things.
It's something this family has always depended on.
I would be lost without it, but sometimes that reckless, crazy belief is just, just reckless and crazy!
You've got to accept that some people can do things that you can't.
Heart surgeons, rocket scientists, that lady at the mall who carves your name into a grain of rice.
- How does she do that?
- No one knows.
Honey, honey, look I am giving you permission not to be omnipotent.
I know it's gonna be hard, but everything will be okay.
I know it will.
Sarsi or Diet Sarsi?
I can't do it.
I can't go on.
Is this any way to start your morning?
Mr. Waffles?
Reese, you can't give up!
You got to keep going.
You got to keep trying.
You don't know what I've been through.
I've been shot at, chased, married, and when the guy found out I was a dude, it wasn't like a total deal breaker.
Son, I know it's hard.
Everything worth doing is hard.
When third quarter profits were down, did Mr. Waffles give up?
No, he did not.
He put more lip-smacking delight in every bite!
I don't think I can move.
You have to move, Reese.
You have to get home to your family and friends and your country.
These people have no idea what breakfast is.
They take rice from the night before and cook it up into a thin paste.
Is that your idea of breakfast?
No, but - Do you ever want to taste my buttery goodness again?
You know I do.
Reese, listen to me.
I now have 20% more blueberries in every box.
My legs.
They plump up in the batter!
They're so juicy that way!
I'm coming home!
I'm proud of you, son.
Whatever happened to Mrs. Waffles?
- She was hot.
- Yes, she was.
But she didn't increase product awareness in girls 3 to 18 a single percent.
Nurse Peterson, you'll be interested to know I took everyone's tranquilizers and flushed them down the toilet.
- What?
- I came here to help because I owe someone something, a soldier like these men.
I didn't come here to stand by and do nothing while you crush their spirits with chemicals.
- He deserved better, and they deserve better.
- What the hell is wrong with you?
You can't take these men off their sedatives.
Oh, my God.
Security!
Guys, please calm down.
Guys!
- You've got to stop.
- Come on, come on!
You have to Oh, I don't want to hear it.
Isn't it bad enough with your mother gone and your brother missing?
You have to go out brawling in the streets?
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.
Wait a minute.
This is our dinner.
Well, good news.
God decided I don't deserve to redeem myself.
I get to carry this soul-crushing guilt for the rest of my life.
Y eah.
I've been trying to compose a requiem for him.
It's hard getting in the right mood using a glitter marker.
- Maybe we've been trying to honor Reese the wrong way.
- What do you mean?
Reese wasn't into helping people and doing good deeds.
He loved to smash stuff and destroy things for no reason.
If we're gonna honor Reese, maybe we should think about doing it his way.
You have something in mind?
This kind of caught my eye.
An art fair?
Just think what Reese would have done with this.
They've got drift wood art, yarn owls, dream catchers, face painting, folk dancing.
They are kind of begging for it.
I don't know.
There's rapping grannies.
Let me see that.
Let me go, please!
Come on.
How was I supposed to know it was your god?
It looked like a monkey man!
You're gonna regret this!
If my husband finds out, he'll make you pay.
Then you'll really be sorry.
Mom?
Thank you so much.
There you are.
What in the name of God were you thinking?
!
Look at you.
You are filthy.
Your nails are a disgrace.
You've been tomb robbing!
Well, the fun stops now, young man!
You are in so much trouble!
I just can't believe he could really be gone.
I know.
Wow, this diaper's got to be a five-pounder.
I'd like to think Jamie knew what it was for.
It's so weird.
It seems like all my life I've wished for something horrible to happen to Reese, and now that it has I - I - Miss him?
Yeah.
I do, too.
Remember when he shaved my eyebrows and glued them back on so I looked permanently surprised?
That was genius.
Remember that look of pure joy he'd get on Christmas morning when he was smashing our presents?
It's in my eyes!
No matter how hard I tried, I could never make Mom's face turn that special purple color.
Reese purple.
Why couldn't I have said something meaningful to him before he Don't do this to yourself.
He would have liked this.
I only wish he could have been here to see it.
Me, too.
Reese!
You're not dead!
I can't believe it.
Reese, I'm so glad to see you.
All right, all right.
Don't 'mo me.
How does this work?
- Oh, well, we have the remote here, and you pick out a good one - Here.
We were saving this one.
It's from when Jamie had swine flu.
Nice.
God, I love this country.
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Boys, cookies!
All right!
Nuh-uh, not that one.
I put Dewey's antibiotics in that one.
Take this one.
It's biggest.
-Did you put anything in this one?
-Of course not.
Just take it.
Then take this one 20 minutes later.
Malcolm in the Middle Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com There's no doubt about it, we're totally gonna go this year.
Totally.
It's not even a question.
What's there to question?
Nothing.
Because we're going.
-We're totally going.
-Totally.
Oh, God, Burning Man again?
Every year it's the same thing.
"This time we're totally going"!
"Oh, yeah, totally"!
And every year you chicken out with some pathetic excuse.
My personal favorite was last year's "really bad Slurpee headache".
See?
That is exactly the kind of ignorant talk I'd expect from someone who doesn't have any appreciation for what Burning Man is.
A week of freedom out in the desert, naked women, getting back to your primal nature, naked women, people doing art, naked women.
Are all the women naked?
That is all you heard, isn't it?
Mom Dad breakfast Jamie Dewey Dad dinner.
WENT TO BURNING MAN BACK MONDAY There.
That should get us till tomorrow.
I can't believe it.
We're really doing it!
We're actually going to Burning Man!
Hitchhiking?
!
Hitchhiking on the highway like hobos?
!
Thank God your mother undercooked the chicken last night, or who knows when we might have found out about this?
!
What were you thinking?
!
Sneaking off in the middle of the night to go to some overblown keg party in the desert!
That is not what Burning Man is all about.
Burning Man is an incredible, interactive experiment in human creativity, where you do art just for art's sake, and you make music from instruments that came to you in dreams.
It's the one place where you're free to let go and really see what you're capable of creating without worrying what anyone else thinks!
That's what Burning Man is all about!
I think she actually might've bought that.
This Burning Person sounds like it's gonna be a lot of fun.
What a great idea, Malcolm.
Yeah.
Maybe next year we can take Grandma to Mardi Gras.
You think I enjoy having powers that I can't control?
Believe me, I'd much rather be as stupid as you are.
Don't try sucking up to me now.
I still can't believe Mr. Barnes let you borrow his fancy RV.
This is so classy.
This is like Buckingham Palace on wheels.
He ripped one on the elevator just before the CEO got on, and I took the blame for it.
That's the way things work in the corporate world.
You're unselfish, and it paid off.
Hey, you boys check out the flat screen TV back in the bedroom?
And the two-thirds-scale fold-down pool table?
Boy, we're gonna have so much fun in this baby!
Whoa, whoa.
What was that?
I just opened an apple juice for Jamie.
And now you can close it back up.
I thought I was clear about this.
The camper is going back without a single stain, smudge, smell or dent.
-Yeah, but I really think Jamie -Dewey, what is the rule?
This one RV is worth three of me.
Okay.
Help me get this grate off.
I'm gonna ditch out when we slow down for a turn.
I am not going to Burning Man with Mom and Dad.
Reese, we're in the middle of the desert.
I know what you're thinking.
The road runners are too smart to catch and eat.
But the coyotes are idiots.
Look, it might not be as embarrassing as we think.
If we move quick, we might be able to sneak off without anyone knowing that we came to Burning Man with our parents.
We're here!
Hey, neighbors!
I'm gonna do art, too.
I brought my paintbrushes.
Okay, let's get moving here.
Reese, Malcolm.
I want you guys They're gone.
They shimmied under the RV and took off running.
Oh.
Well, then I guess it's up to you to help me set up a protective perimeter around the camper.
We'll need about 40 rocks, at least the size of bowling balls.
I'm sorry, son.
You snooze, you lose.
Now, come on, come on.
Don't let the flies get in.
Look at this place, it's amazing!
That has to be the coolest guy on Earth!
See?
I told you everything was gonna be all right even with Mom and Dad here.
We just need to make sure we look out for each other -Excuse-me.
-Whoa!
Ow!
Ow!
Damn it!
I stepped on a cactus.
Can you give me a hand?
Reese?
Hey, buddy?
You know where the topless chicks are?
And I'm not interested in the uggos or blimps, if you know what I'm saying.
Follow me, I'm going that way.
Hey, man, want some Stanley?
First time at Burning Man?
Yeah.
Yeah, I can always tell the newbies.
Hey, you guys, you want a little Stanley?
What's Stanley?
Oh, Stanley was a buddy of mine.
We've been coming to Burning Man together almost 20 years.
Anyway, he passed on over the winter, and he always said he wanted his ashes scattered here, kind of as a way of spreading the spirit of Burning Man to the people and the family he loved.
And you're allowed to do that?
Spray a dead guy on people?
!
I got suspended for a week for putting a mouse's head on the end of my pencil.
Burning Man's all about freedom, dude.
You can do whatever you want here.
Whatever I want?
I could kick this over?
Or break that?
Well, I guess if you really felt you had to.
Doesn't that kind of take the fun out of mindless destruction?
That's what the flaming catapult's for.
Yeah, but the real spirit of Burning Man isn't about destruction.
It's about creating, participating, contributing.
Building a community that needs you, relies on you.
It's about allowing yourself to become part of the whole, and then coming away from it with more than you brought.
No, there's no feeling like it in the world.
Wow.
Yeah, it's a mind-altering journey, son if you're willing to take it.
You know what?
I think I want some Stanley.
Wow!
This stuff is gorgeous.
We really have to get some for the house.
Howdy!
Just getting the old homestead set up.
Best hamburgers and dogs you've ever tasted are on me when I get this baby fired up, huh?
What's he doing?
It's performance art.
He's skewering the empty banality of the modern suburban dad.
Honey, where'd I put my good basting brush?
Honey?
Honey?
This guy's good.
No one told me there was a looky-loo convention in town.
Dad, do I have to circle the whole thing?
I can't find any more rocks.
Son, look, we might be in the desert, but we are still civilized people, and civilized people put up arbitrary boundaries that they will fight to the death to protect.
I'm pretty sure we passed some nice-sized rocks when we turned into the camp.
That's half a mile away!
Don't be silly.
Two miles, easy.
Here we go!
Hal, this place is so great!
I met the nicest group of gals down by the Porta Potti's.
They call themselves a "tribe," like a group of wild Indians.
Isn't that cute?
They invited me to the hemp-braiding tent later.
What are you using the Porta Potti's for when we have the world's greatest toilet ten feet away in the RV?
That thing will suck down a small deer.
Mention free food and they start gathering like flies.
FIRST AID This is great.
I'm gonna spend my entire two days at Burning Man standing in this line.
Hey, man.
You know, the line's much shorter over in front of the Shaman's tent.
The what?
Oh, you will love her.
She totally cured my plantar's warts.
-Thanks, but -Come on, man.
You think I'd lead you wrong?
And remember, if you're gonna eat glass, chew at least ten times before you swallow.
Okay?
Ooh, what do we have here?
I stepped on a cactus.
The needle went right through my shoe.
Let's take a look.
It's not a big deal.
I think I just need some disinfectant and a band-aid and I'll be Ma'am?
Mmm.
You've internalized a lot of criticism, haven't you?
Well, I don't know.
I guess.
But what does Okay here's your problem.
You have an incredible amount of passion in your soul.
But you've got to let down the armor you're using to shield it.
You also need a tetanus shot.
Okay, she's almost as old as my mom, and obviously crazy as a loon.
So why am I so turned on?
Most Western medicines numb the body.
They silence it.
But the body's an amazing thing, Malcolm.
It can tell you what's wrong with it.
All real healing is just listening.
I don't see anything alternative about that.
I just don't see colonizing space as the answer.
I mean, if we can't solve our problems here, what's the point of just exporting them there?
Even Werner Von Braun said that everything science taught him strengthened his belief in the continuity of spiritual existence after death.
Okay, I buy that Godzilla came out of the collective purging of Japanese guilt after World War II, but can you explain to me why the costume had to look so fake?
Well, let's see First I'd say The Go-Go's.
Then The Bangles Bananarama and Josie and the Pussycats.
I can't believe it!
I hated Charlotte's Web, too!
I just wanted to squash that whiny little spider.
Deep Dish.
Chocolate chip.
Oscar the Grouch.
Wow.
And I thought all that crap everyone said about love was just to piss me off.
-So you're going to come?
-Oh, absolutely.
That sounds like a hoot and a half.
Great.
It's by the giant foam tongue.
Just make a left at the guy in the phone booth full of Jell-O.
If you hit the Men's Diaper Brigade you've gone too far.
-See you there.
-Okay.
What's this?
The food's all green.
I added a little food color.
It's artistic.
I'm being artistic.
Mom's right.
I always thought art was just stupid paintings of old dead guys in drag, but I was wrong.
Art can be doing something, or even undoing something.
Like when I blew up the Muller's mailbox, that was art, and I didn't even know it.
Green eggs and toast.
I do not like green eggs and toast.
Oh, for God's sake, Hal, stretch a little.
We're on vacation.
Vacation?
!
Which part of this is vacation?
Armor-Alling the tires for six hours, or scraping the dead bugs out of the grill with a toothbrush?
Why do they have to play Frisbee so close to the RV?
Can't they have fun with that thing without constantly throwing it around?
And where's Malcolm?
Did he even come home last night?
I gotta tell you, Lois, I really don't think I like this place.
I think I love this place.
No, I'm sure I do.
Good morning.
Did you know you are the most incredible woman who ever lived?
Well, I knew I was in the top three.
But I guess your vote clinches it.
So, are we going to spend the day together?
I thought we could go check out the Circle of Infinity Oh, I have a ton of re-birthing ceremonies to do today.
But we can get together later.
How about that?
Sure, that sounds great.
What's the matter?
Nothing.
I'm happy.
Really, really happy.
No, there's something the matter, but I just can't pin it down.
Nothing's wrong.
You go do your re-birthing whatevers, and we'll get together later.
Contempt.
That's it.
What are you talking about?
You have contempt for me, and for what I do.
No, no, not at all.
I should really just keep my mouth shut for the next five seconds.
Four, three I mean, it is a pretty silly ritual, but I guess I don't see any real harm in it.
You know, I have a lot to do today and I think you should probably go.
-No -Good-bye, Malcolm.
This guy's really captured something here.
This piece is as vicious as it is funny.
What are you looking at?
!
Haven't you ever seen a man sweep his lawn with a broom before?
Okay, that's enough.
I've had it.
Go on, get out of here, you punks.
What the hell is wrong with you people?
!
Doesn't anybody have respect for personal property anymore?
You can think about that for a few days until I give this back to you.
I bet orphanages don't take family trips.
Or kids raised by animals.
How come they get all the breaks?
Okay, Lois, you can open your eyes now.
Oh, my gosh.
This is fantastic.
Oh I wish there was a JC Penney nearby.
I'd love to get wallets of this.
Who's stupid idea was it to come here, anyway?
I'm with you, Malcolm.
We don't belong here.
This place is full of freaks and weirdoes.
And now your mother and Jamie are out there with them, doing God knows what.
You're going to be okay, Malcolm, because you are just like me.
-I am?
-Well, sure.
They say we're stubborn, they say we're closed-minded, but I say there's nothing closed-minded about shunning ideas that make you scared and uncomfortable.
Yeah.
And who cares if they say we're afraid of life?
Life is scary.
Life is things eating things.
I say let everyone out there go ahead and eat each other.
You and I we're gonna be in here together, safe and sound.
I've been a total idiot.
I've got to get over myself.
Where are you going?
Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you, young man!
Get off my property!
What?
What did I do?
-Come with us.
-Wait.
I want my lawyer.
He's the naked guy in the buffalo head.
It's okay, Reese, you're not in any trouble.
We want you to be the torchbearer for the big Burning Man ceremony.
-You do?
-Absolutely.
I can't think of anyone who has embraced and embodied the spirit of the festival more than you have.
Really?
Wow.
Hey, don't say anything to my lawyer, okay?
I don't want to have to give him a piece of this.
Open yourselves to the energy of re-birthing.
I can do this.
I can be open-minded.
So it's a little weird.
Most rituals are a little weird, right?
He really needs a fresh start.
We made a lot of mistakes his first two days.
Okay, so it's totally insane.
I don't care, I'm doing it.
I got to tell you, man, you've been fantastic.
Thanks.
What's this for?
What's it for?
It's to set him on fire.
What?
!
That's how we end Burning Man, man, by burning the man.
But it can't end.
I don't want it to.
For my first time in my life I've been real, like I belong.
We've all been there, man.
But it still has to end.
But why?
That's just the way it is.
Look, it's cool if you don't want to Get back!
Everyone just stay back!
No one's burning Burning Man!
Malcolm?
What are you doing here?
I did it.
I actually did it.
You re-birthed yourself -For me?
-No.
Well, yeah, originally, but something happened in there.
I mean, I was able to open my mind and be accepting of something I didn't believe in.
I've never been able to do that before.
It's amazing, I actually feel like I've been reborn.
It feels fantastic.
And it's all thanks to you.
Oh, Malcolm.
We can never see each other again.
-What?
-This can never work.
You're just way to manuable.
The condescending cynic, I could deal with, but this I don't want you doing things just because I want you to do them.
Then I won't.
If that's what you want.
Crap.
I'm sorry, Malcolm.
Life is a journey at you have to take on your own.
I've tried my own journey.
ItÂs sucks.
Please, please, please, just take me with you.
I don't take up a lot of space.
-You have to go now.
-But Great.
Who knew this life could be even crappier than the last one?
Stay back!
Stay back!
I mean it!
Get in the van, Reese.
We're going home.
Dad, you gotta help me.
They want me to burn Burning Man.
Oh, for crying out loud, just torch the bastard and we're out of here.
I'm ready.
I finally got your precious floor mats clean.
-Let's get the hell out of here.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Are you insane?
You're not going into my beautiful van looking like that.
Hey!
Here come the Trumpet Strumpets.
Let's burn the man!
Reese.
You behave yourself, young man.
You hear me?
You look incredible, honey.
Now get in the van.
-No!
No, please!
-Burni
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Dewey, could you reach in my sock drawer and get me a pair of socks?
OK.
Not that one.
On top.
Not on the top of the dresser.
Right in front of you, the sock drawer.
It's your sock drawer.
Go next to it.
On the other side.
Not behind the dresser.
All you to do is reaching into my drawer and So stupid, Dewey.
Special thanks to @DBfansub After two months of unemployment, Mom went to Lucky Aide and begged for her job back.
They finally let her come back as a probationary employee.
It just goes to show you, Malcolm.
If you want to wear the smock, you can't be afraid to humble yourself.
I'd forgotten how well this hangs.
Honey?
I've got a surprise!
Oh, we're running late, Hal.
I can't be late while I'm still on probation at the store.
This is worth it!
Ta-da!
It's a cat habitat.
You know how you're always saying there's no reason for us to get a cat?
Well, now there is one!
It's got a tetherball, two main decks, an activity centre and a crow's nest to look out for other cats.
I call it, Cat-Man-Do.
Like every idea she has is so great!
Do you think it's going to snow?
Don't be silly.
It hasn't snowed in a year and a half.
That could change.
We could have a snow day any day now.
I deserve a snow day!
The whole neighbourhood's going to see this thing in our trash, and know your mother is nuts!
It's awfully big.
Do you think the trash man's going to take this?
Oh, he'll take it.
That's why I'm leaving him a six pack.
You're the only thing I've ever been proud of.
Come on, Dewey.
Didn't you used to work here a couple of months ago?
Oh, yeah.
I practically ran this place for about twelve years.
If anything, I still hold the record.
Lois!
Mr Crechale said probationary employees have to wear the pin.
It's so big.
I've been on probation lots of times, Lois.
You can choose not to feel humiliated.
They're just trying to break your spirit with the pin, and the drug test, and those draconian hygiene checks.
I suggest for the next two weeks, you wash your hands after using the bathroom, just in case.
Oh, by the way, they changed the codes.
The Women's Room isn't Oh, and if you ever need the Men's, don't try 876466, it's 459929.
Damn it.
Overring on Two.
I'm sure you're good at lots of things.
What is this?
It's the new ad campaign for Smooth Malt Liquor.
You don't find this offensive?
!
Why?
It's a black janitor with a mop and a six pack of Malt Liquor in his hand.
I don't know that he's the janitor, maybe he just spilled something.
His name is Slappy?
!
A delightful throwback to a simpler time.
Well, I'm getting rid of it.
If you get caught, I don't know about this.
And I'd loved to have been called Slappy growing up!
The Trash Man didn't take it?
!
Nope.
Where's the beer?
Oh, he took that.
He drank one and poured the rest into his thermos.
And he left this here to mock me.
Maybe we can chop it up.
No!
Dewey, we are not accommodating him.
I did not pour my heart and soul into this thing so that the Trash Man could refuse to take it away.
There are principles that need to Shoo!
Get out of there!
This society is falling to pieces.
What are you doing?
We had to replace the one that was stolen last week.
I think Craig took it so he can use the car pool late.
Craig didn't take it.
I took it, and put it in the trunk of my car.
Mom, what are you doing?
You're on probation.
This is completely racially insensitive, it has no place in this store.
But Mr Crechale told me to put it up.
Well, I'm telling you to take it down.
I can't do that.
You're not my boss here, Mr Crechale is.
Mr Crechale didn't tear three inches getting you out of him.
Now, are you going to take this down or not?
No.
She isn't coming after me, is she?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
- Yeah?
- I don't know if you remember, I put this cat habitat out last week.
Yeah, I can't take that.
It's too big.
But, you took the six pack that I left you.
You must have known it was an advance thank you.
Actually, I thought it was an overdue apology.
Apology?
Why would this family give you an apology?
Because you people are pigs!
You don't even use half the stuff you throw out.
And nine months after your wife leaves three Birth Control pills in the pack, here comes the disposable diapers again.
Talk about screwed up priorities!
You guys buy those generic diapers that break apart in the can, and yet I notice someone could afford a Toblerone every Friday!
Hey buddy, this family's trash is none of your business!
You know what?
Let's start again.
There's no reason we can't be civil.
Now, you have a hard job.
It's a job I respect.
Hey, Oscar.
Here's your lunch.
All high mighty for a trash guy.
Oops.
Overring on Two.
What's that?
!
Mmm?
I threw that picture away!
Oh, we still have a negative.
It reminds me of the old you.
Back when you still knew right from wrong.
Just because I'm not doing what you want, doesn't mean you get to humiliate me!
Humiliate you?
You mean there's an offensive image on display in the store?
My son used to love to play dress-up just like that.
Give him a call.
Take that down!
Gee, I'm not doing what you want.
You're not doing what I want.
Maybe we should bring Mr Crechale into this, since he's the only one whose opinion you seem to care about.
"No employee may display personal items in his or her workspace".
Don't worry, Mom.
It only added a day to your probation.
I'm sorry, God.
You're against the rules here.
I don't know who I am any more.
Now, that's in the name of that dude.
I have to admit, I didn't see this coming.
Well, the Sanitation Department claims that the trash man has an airtight alibi for last night.
If I want to haul this stuff away myself, I need $1,200 for a 19 ton truck, and a classified sanitation license, which I'm pretty sure I don't have.
Honey, I don't want you to worry about this.
I will get rid of this crud, no matter how long it takes.
Hey!
What makes you think that's ok?
!
Honey, I am not going to tell you that this is ideal.
But if we refuse to fight this fight, then we're really living in garbage.
Garbage of the spirit!
And that's got to be the worst kind.
Now, I feel sorry for our neighbours with no garbage on their lawn, but we don't want to sound too superior, everyone's doing the best they can.
You know Lois, there are things I don't say, like none of this would have happened if you'd let us have a cat!
Can you believe some of the stuff people throw out?
Did you shut the door, tape the cracks and spray?
You know, if you just dive in, you get used to it.
How am I supposed to tell if the milk is bad?
Everything in this house smells the same.
Principles don't always smell like roses, boys.
We are in this temporary situation because this family stands for something.
I expect a little stoicism around here.
Oh, I'll be stoic, Dad.
Until the massive pile of trash we're living in starts to decompose, and the maggots start fighting with the cockroaches about who gets to eat the rats' faecal matter, and then you're going to hear some complaining from me.
I think we've got a leak in here.
Reese, check the windows.
Oh, I didn't think I'd make it.
On the table.
Hey, Craig.
Ready to go.
Craig's driving you?
Yeah.
You can take the car.
But we can just go together.
Could we?
Huh.
You've been so intent and acting like we weren't in the same family.
No, that's not what I've been doing!
I'm just mature enough to draw out a station between what goes on at home and what we have to do at work.
Oh, I see.
So it's ok to sell out your principles as long as long as you're doing it for money.
Yes, Mom!
Big money!
I've thrown away all my morale and agree to go to hell for $6.25 an hour!
You know that sign is a bigoted image, Malcolm.
It's not that bad.
It's a picture of a man with a mop and a beer.
People who mop drink beer.
People who drink beer mop.
Oh, Slappy?
He's amazing.
He's tripled our Smooth Malt Liquor sales.
I can't believe I've raised a son who is so insensitive to things that really matter If I'm insensitive, I got that way by watching you!
Both of you, stop it!
You're making this place unliveable!
Let's go, Craig.
I think it's nice when someone does a little something extra for Poker Night.
I mean, a six tonne pile of trash?
You really know how to make a guy feels pleasure.
You know the smell around here actually makes Hal's dip tastes good.
Man, who dump me this hand, I'm throwing it out on the front yard.
Guys, I really don't know what I'm going to do.
I mean, if I give up now, what kind of example does that set for my boys?
Yeah, that's a tough one, Hal.
A man keeps chipping away at his authority.
The next thing you know, he's not the king of his own massive pile of garbage.
Come on, guys.
Hal's suffering.
We really should be more sensitive No, wait, I got one.
I see my favourite band out there, A Flock of Seagulls!
Oh, man!
If anyone looks at my cards, I'll be able to tell.
What the hell are you doing?
!
I just thought I'd show this to the guys.
You can explain why you've been fighting to keep this up at the store.
I wasn't fighting for it, I was just told to put it up by my boss.
You also added very vehemently that, "it's not so bad".
Maybe you can explain to everyone here why this isn't racist.
First we picked the cotton, then we had to solve them moral dilemmas.
It's probably the saddest sight of all when racism impacts on white people.
Oh, how many white mothers and sons must be torn in a sudden before we learned all this?
It's bad enough we have to watch them dancing in their weddings?
Jagging their flat ass Will you stop it?
I need your help!
This is a completely offensive false image of African-American men!
You know what's really bothering you?
You don't think I'm prejudist.
You're just mad that at work I don't have to obey you.
And now that I'm getting older, you're losing more and more control over me every day.
You can't stand that soon I'll be free!
He has a dream!
Sing it, my brother!
Should we talk about what's really bothering you?
It's that you know I'm right!
You do have a code of ethics that you're trying to deny!
What do you know about ethics?
Bringing this in here to embarrass me in front of Dad's friends?
!
Did I tell Dad how you said that sooner or later he'll realize he'll look ridiculous, and quit this stupid fight with the trash man?
!
Did I?
!
No!
Because, no matter how mad I get, I always treat you with some level of decency!
I'll realize I look ridiculous.
Hal, that's not the point!
Stop this!
Just stop!
What do we need to fight for?
It's a nice night.
We came here to play cards.
Can we just play cards?
Why, what have you got?
Nothing.
Dad?
Dewey?
!
Dad?
Dewey?
Dewey, where are you?
I don't know!
My garbage port collapsed.
Can you breathe?
Yes.
But I don't want to!
Just keep digging until you reach daylight.
Hey.
I got your note.
I need some help with this, I am in over my head.
You did the right thing coming to me.
Your mother can never know!
It's not a problem.
There's a way to solve this little trash dilemma, but I need to know that you'll go all the way.
You have to want it bad.
The fact that I came to you should prove how desperate I am.
Good enough.
From here, there's no turning back.
We can implement my plan tonight.
Meet me back here at exactly six o'clock.
That's in twenty minutes.
Do you want to go now?
OK.
It's not stealing, it's just borrowing.
Not stealing, just borrowing.
First we pick up all the trash from our lawn.
Then we top it off with a little medical waste, and we pay a visit to a certain garbage man.
And those guard dogs are going to be ok?
No one gets pain.
They may have a slight headache.
Son, if you could just apply this kind of focus and determination to your school work Oh, that ship has sailed.
Only six more hours until that pin comes off!
The last six hours of probation are what I call 'The Danger Zone'.
Your eyes are so focused on the finish line, you don't even realize your hands are stuffing your pockets full of trail mix.
Damn it, Craig.
Do you believe in right and wrong?
I'm not sure I follow.
Let's just say there's something you have to do, and you've been hoping someone else would do it.
But you've gradually realized you have to do it yourself, even if it breaks the rules.
Dear God, I thought I'd lost my chance years ago!
Huh?
Let's just get in the car and drive.
You don't have to pack, I have clothes for you in the trunk.
Oh, for the love of God.
Thank the Lord you're getting rid of that thing!
Oh, Shirley, I had to.
I just couldn't stand it any longer.
Oh, believe me, I know.
Ever since that thing went up, I swear we've had so many more black people in here.
What?
!
That is not our clientele.
We just don't have the personnel to follow them around.
Thank you, Lois.
What are you doing?
I'm putting this back.
Really?
You know I've always believed in admitting when I was wrong, but there were things about this I hadn't considered.
Maybe I was too focused on controlling you.
The point is, I want this to stay.
This has to stay!
Wow!
Now all I want to do is take it down.
I mean, look at this thing!
It's horribly offensive!
What year are we living in, his name is Slappy for God's sakes!
If I take it down now, she'll think I'm only doing it to be contrary.
Am I only doing it to be contrary?
No.
I really am offended by this.
These are my true feelings which I wasn't able to have before, because I was being contrary.
Unless, it's the opposite of that.
Ok, I am definitely taking this down, while I'm walking away and leaving it here while I pretend to do nothing and figure out what to do.
Ok, go ahead.
Reese, what are you doing?
!
Come on!
Dad, I followed a possum that led me out!
Dewey, not now!
This is Daddy's time with Reese.
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Dewey, I don't need you talking sense to me right now!
Reese, what's going on?
What good is running going to do?
We live here!
Nice try, little boy!
If I leave it up, Mom gets what she wants.
If I take it down, Mom still has hooks on me which is what she really wants.
No matter what I decide wait a minute, I don't have to decide.
I can leave it to chance.
Heads, I take it down.
Tails, I'll leave it up.
I'm not listening to my Mom any more.
From now on, I'm listening to you.
I'm so glad you like the fillet.
It really brings out the finish in the wine.
So, we'll be taking away three bags today?
Two.
Of course, two.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Who wants some ice cream?
Who's been a good boy all day and deserves some delicious ice cream?
That's right, Jamie gets ice cr That's it, Jamie.
He sure loves his ice cream, doesn't he?
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.04 - Pearl Harbor Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com This place holds a surprising number of living species This blows.
Get up and change the channel.
I didn't lose the remote.
You get up and change the channel.
I didn't lose it either!
So the stupid cops let my dad off with another warning.
We've lived in this neighborhood for three weeks and they still haven't carted him off yet.
No!
Jessica, you don't get to keep barging in here every day like you own the place!
Go back outside and knock.
And then go away!
Seriously, what do you have to do to get popped for drunk and disorderly around here?
He was out on the curb in his underpants, rolling burning trash cans into the street.
The sad thing is, we're still the worst family on this block.
Coming up next, The Strongest Man in the World Competition.
Yes, finally!
What are you doing?
Watching House of Style.
You don't get to change our TV!
Malcolm, back me up here!
Reese, give her a break.
Why?
We live in just as big a stink-hole as she does.
Where do we get to escape to?
Reese, you're right.
This is your house.
If you don't want to watch it, you can get up and change it.
Nice try.
Dad, I need some help with my homework.
I don't think so, Dewey.
I put in all this time and effort, then you just have Malcolm correct everything after I go to bed.
I can't do this with Malcolm.
I'm supposed to do a 300-word report on how you're my personal hero.
Me?
You think I'm your hero?
Dad, don't freak out.
We had to pick one of our parents.
Can I just watch you for a while?
Sure.
As a matter of fact, you can help me with my project.
What are you doing?
Well, you know that jerk across the street who's always got it in for me?
Parking jerk or lawn mower jerk?
Huh?
No, Christmas jerk!
Bill Rendall.
Every year that guy waits to see what decorations I put out and then finds a way to top me.
I string lights, he strings better lights.
I put out Frosty, he puts out an elf village.
I put out Dracula, he does nothing and I look like a jackass!
I mean, what kind of sick mind uses a religious holiday as a weapon?
Wait.
Which one is call-the-cops jerk?
That's like four of them.
Anyway, I decided to let Rendall have his precious little Christmas victory if it's so damned important to him.
Okay.
I'm doing Pearl Harbor Day instead.
What?
Pearl Harbor Day.
December 7, 1941.
The opening shot of the Second World War.
I am going to build a spectacular tribute to those courageous soldiers.
It's going to be beautiful and dignified and uplifting and it's gonna be all mine.
Want to help?
Yeah.
It sounds fun.
Are you really gonna put up a formation of flying zombies?
Nah.
I just drew them' cause it looked cool.
Jessica, your pasta recipe is terrific.
Look at us, eating healthy for once.
Reese, you want some more?
No.
She took over the TV, now she's taking over dinner?
This isn't even food.
Reese, it's just low-fat.
And if you knew anything at all about food, you'd know that fats and oils are the vehicles by which flavor travels.
Fat is what makes things taste good.
That's why a wise and loving God created fat in the first place.
She is a guest in our home, and I think it's delicious.
She can make me take it, but she can't make me eat it.
Do you think we should cut up some of these guys so there's more body parts floating in the water?
Nah, that's a little gruesome.
Just melt them with a lighter.
Okay, I have a little announcement to make.
You know how last year, with the conspiracy trial and your father and me losing our jobs, we ended up $20, 000 in debt.
Yeah?
Well, after six months of scrimping and saving and going up to $28, 000 in debt, we are now down $26, 000 in debt!
Look out world, we're back!
I know how much you boys have sacrificed, kicking in your paychecks and working extra shifts, and, well, we thought you guys deserved a reward.
Really?
This is great.
I thought she was going to start charging us for water.
So, your dad and I are taking the whole family, and Jessica, to see a musical!
A what?
A musical.
From Broadway.
It's called Mamma Mia.
They take all those old ABBA songs like "Dancing Queen," and "Fernando," and stick some story in between.
Oh, my God, you're serious.
Six partially obstructed seats.
At first I thought of treating you boys to a rock concert or Motocross or something like that, but then Jessica told me about this and I thought this sounded perfect.
Wow!
I mean, I just mentioned it'cause it was interesting.
I didn't think you were gonna take me.
What a nice surprise.
I need your Calculus notes.
I couldn't listen to a word Mr. Jacobson was saying in that stupid golf shirt.
How can a man have nipples that big?
What?
You can hang out here if you need to get away from your dad, but don't act like we're friends, okay?
Why are you mad at me?
Because I stick up for you all the time.
You turn around and manipulate my mom into doing something only you want to do.
Wait.
You're talking about the show?
Let me explain something to you, Jessica.
My family doesn't have fun.
We aren't nice.
And the one time Mom actually does do something nice, you hijack it for your own I didn't do it for me, I did it for Reese.
What does Reese have to do with it?
You know what he has to do with it.
No, I don't.
Please tell me you're kidding.
About what?
Oh, my God.
You honestly don't know.
You are actually so self-involved and narcissistic that you can't even see it.
See what?
You know what, Malcolm?
Why don't you try to go for maybe two seconds without thinking about yourself and see what you notice?
Stop insulting me.
What the hell are you talking about?
And it never even occurred to you to wonder why Reese is so angry all the time?
Why he acts like such a jerk?
Because he's a jerk.
That's right.
Just because he's your brother doesn't mean you should put any thought into it.
He couldn't possibly be dealing with anything weird and confusing.
He couldn't possibly be afraid to admit that he wanted to go see a musical because you'd make fun of him.
Of course I'd make fun of him.
What kind of guy wants to see a Broadway musical?
Yes, Malcolm.
What kind of a guy does want to go see a Broadway musical?
Come on.
Maybe you're not being selfish.
Maybe you're just too scared where it leads if you think about how much he fusses over his hair and his body and his gourmet cooking.
Some people just don't want to see what's right in front of their faces.
Nuh-uh.
Look, maybe I'm butting in where I don't belong, but you're his brother, and he should at least be able to count on you for support.
Thanks a lot for sticking us with that stupid show.
I didn't do it for me, I did it for your brother.
Malcolm's gay?
I knew it!
Wow!
Look at it go, huh?
They may have been responsible for one of the most devastating attacks in American history, but by God, they make good toy.
Is that what I think it is?
Dad, it's not really I'm just gonna take a little peek.
"My Dad, My Hero".
I might have jazzed it up a little.
Dewey, everything in this report is just made up.
Every word of it.
I I never did any of this stuff.
Are you sure?
I could've sworn Mom said something about you giving your parachute to an orphan in midair.
You are not going to turn in a paper full of lies.
But, Dad, it's due on Tuesday!
You're just gonna have to find another way.
Let me explain something about heroism, son.
There are all kinds of bravery in the world.
All kinds.
You don't have to be a Special Forces Ranger or fight crime in a cape to be a hero.
There's the unsung bravery of the common man.
Normal people who prove their courage every day, by standing up for their families or being decent to other people and Is it bleeding?
Hey.
Hey!
You want half?
I'll fix my own.
Peanut butter's good, too.
Nothing wrong with having peanut butter.
What?
Just because I'm having ham doesn't mean you have to have ham.
Just because we're brothers doesn't mean we have to enjoy the same thing, right?
Exactly.
Everybody's different.
It'd be stupid if I tried to force you to like something I liked.
Right.
Plus, it wouldn't work anyway.
People can't help what they like.
That's just the way they're born.
I know.
Like me, I've never liked ham.
Really?
'Cause maybe if you tried it No.
But that's me.
I'm not putting it down or anything.
I hear you.
There's no right sandwich.
So, um the ABBA thing Should be great.
Yeah, absolutely.
Just great.
Hey.
Have a good snack.
You, too.
Hal, you have to get ready.
The show starts in an hour, and we still have to drop Jamie off on the way.
Almost done.
Hey, have you seen Dewey around?
I promised him he could fire-bomb the Utah.
He's doing schoolwork.
It was so sweet.
He told me this afternoon he's writing a What a wonderful night!
How could they say the theater is dead when a spectacle like that is being bused all over the country?
Yeah, who knew you could use the same three chords over and over and people would sit through it for two hours?
You can be Mr. Fancy Pants music snob if you like, but everyone else loved it.
Thank you for including me.
I had so much fun.
Yeah, me, too.
I especially liked the part where the father was stabbed in the back by his son.
That wasn't in the show, Hal.
Well, I saw it somewhere.
I'm glad you boys liked it so much.
I've never seen you like this.
You didn't stop smiling at each other all night.
How could you not love a show like that?
Yeah, nothing creepy about it at all.
You guys want to listen to the CD again?
Again?
Oh, yeah.
Love ABBA.
I could listen to it forever.
and then I said, "You keep your sexist, adolescent humor to yourself, Your Honor".
Let's just say two days of picking up trash on the freeway never felt so good.
Wow, all these great stories: the judge, those bikers I don't know any other way to say this, Mom, but you're kind of a bad-ass.
You know I don't appreciate that kind of language.
If anyone cares, I'll be in the garage alone, commemorating our heroic stand against a heartless, back-stabbing, traitorous attack.
Okay, hon.
Then there was this time at the store with this huge shoplifter and he Beautiful Bianca is ready to make the Fashionistas swoon in her flowing crepe jumpsuit This is nice.
What'd you think of the Versace?
Well, it has a nice drape, and it seems like a kicky look for fall.
Yeah, I think it's yummy.
Okay, you know what?
This is stupid.
We have to talk about this.
Right.
I mean, just because it's weird doesn't mean we can't handle it.
We're brothers.
Right.
We've been through everything together.
We shouldn't be pussy footing around about it.
I got you something.
Hey, I got you something.
Really?
See, this is what I'm talking about.
We're being open and supportive and honest with each other.
Here.
What's this?
It's called "If You're Gay, It's Okay".
It's full of great resources.
What's this?
Naughty Pool Boys III.
I watched ten or 12 of these, and this one seems to have the most stuff you guys like.
Wait.
I'm not gay.
You're gay.
No, I'm not.
You are.
I'm not gay.
Malcolm, check out what they're doing in that movie, and then tell me you're not gay.
No, this is She said Oh, my God!
You plan, you hope, but you never think it's going turn out this good!
Stop laughing.
I don't think I can!
When you guys were dancing, and you did that little Oh, my God, it was so sweet!
There's nothing more I can ask for, honestly.
You guys make me so happy!
Oh, God, it hurts!
Well, I better go drag my dad off the lawn.
He likes to fall asleep right next to the toilet.
See you guys at dinner.
Vendetta.
How could she be so?
Vendetta!
Yes, vendetta.
Reese, I promise, we'll get back at her.
But we have to be careful.
She's got Mom totally on her side.
Oh, yeah.
It's tricky.
Somehow, we've got to figure out a way to turn Mom against her.
Okay, got it.
What?
It's a little risky, but I'll tell you one thing.
No one calls me gay and gets away with it!
Wow.
Dad, it's beautiful.
Well, I did what I could on my own.
Yeah.
Sorry.
Then he accused me of loving Mom more than him just because I wouldn't slash her boyfriend's tires.
I'm so sorry, honey.
Parents shouldn't put their kids in the middle.
Or hit on their friends.
Boys, come get the groceries.
I hope this means we can eat soon.
Hold it.
What's that?
What?
That.
A turtleneck.
What do you care?
You don't wear turtlenecks.
Can I just get the groceries so we can eat?
I've got a ton of homework Aha!
Mom, don't!
Who gave you that?
None of your business!
What is your problem, anyway?
Can't you go five seconds without butting into my life?
What?
It wasn't her, Mom!
I swear!
You always think you know everything, but you're wrong!
You're dead wrong this time!
I think you and I need to have a little talk.
But I Come on.
When your mom comes out, she's gonna want to know what I said to you about this.
Make up something good.
He did it to me again.
I suppose you have a good explanation for this.
Not really.
Lois, I'm sorry.
I'm not going to lie to you.
I gave him the hickey to keep him from doing something really stupid.
Excuse me?
I'm not saying I was smart either, but There's this girl that Malcolm's been chasing, and she's really bad news.
She's sexually active and I'm pretty sure she's into drugs, and the only reason why he's interested in her is because he's so insecure about himself.
We got into this fight and I was saying that he could do so much better and he said that nobody liked him anyway, and I was telling him that a lot of girls liked him because he's sweet and cute and funny, and then he kinda grabbed me and we started kissing and I couldn't stop because then he would think I was making the whole thing up and I'm sorry.
I didn't know what else to do.
Wow, that's a pretty convincing lie for just winging it.
I mean, you went a little overboard with the crying, but the basic story was good.
Drug girl was a nice touch.
Creepy, a little sad.
But how did you?
Sweetie, I'm a mother.
It's my business to know.
You've got talent, but I turned pro 20 years ago.
Which isn't to say you haven't been useful.
I never would've been able to enjoy that play in peace if the boys weren't occupied.
And the gay thing was very entertaining.
But more important, those two idiots actually treated each other decently for a few days.
Thank you for that.
So, here's the deal.
As of today, you are banned from this house.
You violated my trust.
I don't want you around my boys.
Knowing that, they will automatically forgive you and sneak you back in.
You will be here every day after school until You will have complete run of the house, but I want Reese to do his half hour of assigned reading and Malcolm to complete all his college applications, not just the Ivy Leagues.
And no junk food.
Understood?
For how long?
We'll see.
"Ice Capades" are coming in a few months.
Sure would be nice to go as a family.
Do you think we have enough?
Let's hope so.
I cleaned out every bait shop in town.
What the hell did you do that for?
Your stuff was in my spot.
I would've moved it.
Try asking, butt-munch.
Right, like you hear anything but the sound of your own voice.
Get bent.
Bite me.
I liked you better when we were gay.
Me, too.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
I said wash them!
Special thanks to @DBfansub - That was a good one, Abe!
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?
Reese stop it.
You're going to give yourself leprosy!
Thank you so much for letting us be a part of Dewey's birthday.
You enjoying your special day, son?
I expect nothing and I'm still let down.
It's serious.
I hope you like your present, honey.
You know, birthdays are going to be a little thin around here until we get back on our feet.
No, I love my "Quarters of America".
You see, we started you out with California and the Maine.
Oops, these are both Maine.
Well, guess you won't be needing this one.
Where is Francis?
He was supposed to be here for my party.
Oh, he called.
There was a TV show he wanted to finish watching.
He'll get here after your bedtime.
Listen, I don't want to step on Dewey's big day, here Don't worry about it.
but I just can't keep the news to myself.
Stevie has been chosen to receive a Teen Courtesy Award.
This is fantastic, I don't know anyone who deserves it more.
What is it?
The International Courtesy Association is awarding him a Gallet.
That's the award they give to the youngster who best observes a Teen Courtesy Pledge, to be clean, quiet, polite and obedient.
Congratulations, Stevie.
Thank you.
See?
He can't turn it off.
We are all very proud of you Stevie.
I'd keep this Courtesy Award to myself.
That crippled thing won't protect you so much.
The Award Dinner's on the 12th.
We want you all to come.
You've been so good to us through the difficulties.
You've been just like family.
How's the divorce going, Abe?
Have you been able to find Kitty?
No address, but when I searched the Internet, I found some interesting pictures of her.
From what I could tell, she seems to have overcome her fear of meeting new people.
Whoa, but hey, I'm looking forward.
Why, just yesterday, this cute new teller at my bank started flirting with me.
- Really?
- Get this.
She told me I forgot to date my check.
Date, Hal.
Wow.
Are you excited about this Courtesy Award I'll need your help with my acceptance speech.
There are so many people to thank.
Have you thought about a blanket thank you?
I have a plan.
Oh my god.
This is so cool.
Did you know that underneath your skin, there's more skin?
Why have I always been so careful?
Thanks for a wonderful night.
You know what, I'm seriously thinking about dropping by my bank tomorrow, and asking that new teller for some penny rows.
Hey, Mr Hot Stuff.
Save some for the other fellas.
- Bye-bye, guys.
- Goodnight.
Bye.
Come on, Son.
Kitty?
Kitty Kenarban!
How long have you been out there?
Not long.
All night.
It looked like a lovely party.
Hi, Hal.
Hi, Kitty.
I should justumhmm.
What are you doing there?
Well, I've sort of been stalking my family, trying to get the nerve to talk to them.
I want to come back.
You want to come back?
I know what I did was terrible.
I do not know what happened to me.
I guess I spent so much of my life being outrageous and uptight and good, that something in me finally snapped, and I had to be bad.
The last two years of my life have been a nightmare of booze binges and hotel rooms.
Oh, there were so many parties.
So many weird scenes.
The childhood game of "Musical Chairs" will never be the same for me.
Neither will "Shoots and Ladders", "Candy Man" or "Capture The Flag".
But you know what's really amazing?
Now that I have done literally everything, I'm finished.
I'm done.
You've done everything?
And now I'm done.
Done for good.
Wait, I don't get "Candy Land".
I am so sorry for what I've done, just want to throw myself at Abe's feet and beg his forgiveness, but, it just seems impossible.
Could you, find it in your hearts to, maybe talk to him for me?
Oh, Kitty.
There's not a chance in the world I would ever do that for you.
- But I - You abandoned your family.
Do you have any idea of the pain and humiliation you have inflicted on that dear, sweet man and that poor innocent boy?
I know you and I used to be friends but what you have done is so creepy and evil, it doesn't get fixed with "I'm sorry".
It just doesn't.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Hey, where's the party?
Oh.
Hi Kitty.
Ok, we'll catch up later.
Ok, Dewey.
Since you're now officially old enough, today's the day we start your initiation into full brotherhood.
- Wow.
Really?
- Yep.
Reese went through this, Malcolm went through this, and now, it is your turn.
Neat, when do we start?
Right now.
Get out of bed, and lie down on the Floor of Brotherhood.
And give me the Pillow of Paternity.
- Hey, Abe.
- We need to talk.
What's going on?
Give me a second.
I'm just soagitated.
- What's the matter?
- Kitty came over last night.
Oh, Abe.
Would you like some tea or something?
No, thank you.
But I would like some clarification.
What?
Did you actually call the woman I love, "creepy" and "evil"?
- Wait a minute.
You're mad at me?
- What happened, Abe?
Kitty and I talked all night long.
She told me about everything.
Every horrifying detail was covered.
And by morning, we decided to try and make a go of it.
Stevie's over the moon.
The boy needs a mother.
And lord knows I need a wife.
So, in the future, Lois, I'd appreciate a bit more support and respect for my wife.
You're mad at me?
Were you going to pretend that the last two years just didn't happen?
No, but I don't see the need for you to bring it up when you're not an affected party.
You guys have to see this.
You know how you thought I would never do anything with my life?
Well, prepare to be blown away.
I'm going for the full body, head to toe.
One continuous skin.
It'll be the greatest thing ever.
Reese, get that off my chair, and get out of here.
We're discussing something important.
Fine.
You're not getting one dime of the film rights.
Abe, how can you be mad at me?
I've been there for you, day after day, month after month through all the dinners, and the tearful phone conversations, the Parent-Teacher Conferences for Stevie.
For God's sake, Abe.
I'm your friend Then I wish you'd start acting like one.
And now if you'll excuse me.
I have a wedding album I have to tape back together.
Receive the mystic waters that unite us in fraternal bonds.
For though we are divided by maternal evil, so shall we be.
Ok, I found something down there.
Ok, Dewey.
Eat up.
You're going to need your nourishment if you're going to get through these next three days.
You took three days off work to do this?
Quit stalling and suck ants.
Mostof all I'd like to thank my father.
Got it.
Ladies and gentlemen, friends and family.
Esteemed colleagues of courtesy who honour me, but I can't let this occasion pass without remarking that you all share this award.
Tonight helped me raise a better partiality as we strike a blow for stability.
As we kiss rudeness goodbye, and wish it well.
And furth Reese, we're working on Stevie's speech.
I'm at a critical juncture, here.
I've hit a mole, and I'm trying to decide whether I should work around it, or try to dig it out.
The roots are pretty shallow.
That's grotesque, Reese.
You don't understand the important work I'm doing here, Malcolm.
I'm creating a new Reese.
Shedding my old life.
That's how snakes live forever.
You're an idiot.
I thought you boys might like some chips and lemonade.
No thanks.
My creepy Mom gave me juice.
not right, Hal.
It's just not right.
What business do they have being angry at me?
Kitty ruined their life.
She tore them apart.
She tortured them for two years, and I'm the bad guy?
I'm not the one with the S.T.D. Mammectomy.
I'm not the one who smuggled Lord knows what, in Lord knows where across the Turkish border.
Hal?
What?
You're absolutely right, honey.
You're absolutely right, I couldn't have said it better myself.
Hal, you're really not helping.
I'm sorry Lois, but you sort of brought this on yourself.
I mean, you should have known better than to say something bad about the girl after a guy breaks up with her.
They always wind up getting back together.
This isn't Biff and Buffy breaking up before the High School Dance.
I just I don't understand how he could take her back.
He's in love with her.
And despite everything that's happened, he's still in love with her.
I understand that.
I would take you back if it happened to us.
Oh, you would not.
How can you say that?
There's no life without you.
Oh, shut up and go to sleep.
Aren't you a little old for this?
Prepare to drink from the chalice of brotherhood.
Something smells horrible.
Is that the drip pan?
You're not supposed to know.
I'm not drinking from that.
It's disgusting.
Yes, it is disgusting, but it must be done.
Oh, man.
Awesome, Dewey.
You did it!
I'm done?
You passed with flying colours.
You are now a Full Brother.
Now I would like to present to you the Cookie of Brotherhood.
- That's it?
- What do you mean?
I did all that crap for a stupid cookie?
It's a meaningful cookie.
It's a symbol of something really cool and special, you little ingrate.
It's a symbol of what an idiot I am.
You know nothing of fraternity and sacred rituals.
Give me back my cookie.
Well, I hit a little bump in the road.
I totally forgot I wasn't sunburnt underneath my swimming suit.
Are you wearing legwarmers?
Anything worth doing, is worth doing right.
Andsave.
I think this is going to work.
Why is your mom so mean?
I guess when you find something you're really good at, you just stick with it.
I'm glad you understand about my mother.
Why would you ever think that?
What?
Stevie, I'm sure whatever my mom said was way too harsh, and totally unjustified.
But your mom abandoned you guys.
Don't you even care about all the crap she put you and your dad through?
She shouldn't be able to just say "I'm sorry" and get away with it.
This conversation is over right now.
Can anyone help me?
I can't reach this.
Get that thing out of here.
You're spending all this time with Stevie, helping him with his little Wussy Award, and you won't even help someone in your own family reach immortality?
MOVE!
Stevie Wait, Guys!
Ok, ok.
I see how it is.
You want my dream to die!
I'm sorry you guys are going to miss Stevie's award.
Make sure you keep checking in on Dewey.
What did the doctor say?
It's weird.
He said it's some kind of intestinal thing that people in third world countries get from drinking stagnant water.
Huh.
That is weird.
- You know, you don't have to go.
- Oh, Hal.
Stevie's a wonderful boy.
I'm going to go and support him.
- He doesn't want you there.
- Well, that's too damn bad.
I'm going to support him whether he wants it or not.
They think I'm the one with the problem, and they are wrong, Hal.
They are wrong.
And I'm not going to let them get away with it.
I just think it's going to be a little uncomfortable.
Oh, I guarantee it's going to be a little uncomfortable.
And if you do anything to make it any less uncomfortable, I will never forgive you.
Oh, thank you, Sir Please A Lot and and Jam Masters, thank you.
Who says rap has to be rude?
I wish I could thank each and every one of you, for making this night possible.
But there isn't time.
I'm kidding.
Of course, there is.
Erin Errison, Barnett Errison, Barnett Errison Junior I can't believe you brought that thing with you.
It has a name, Malcolm.
Even though the mashed potatoes are not supposed to come with the duck, cram them in there, anyway.
Whether the duck likes it or not.
- Ma'am?
- The beef.
Even though it's the carrots that are the problem, I'd like to exclude the broccoli.
That may work as a metaphor, Ma'am, but you're really screwing up your entrÃ©e.
I'll just have another Margarita.
Oh, and hurry, it's sort of an emergency.
You need another roll in there, Dewey?
Shut up!
I'm really sorry.
I got carried away.
I justI missed you guys.
And let's face it, torture and humiliation are the only ways we have ever known to say we love each other.
You know you're only making yourself feel better.
Ok, ok.
I want to give you something, Dewey.
Something special.
I've never even told Reese or Malcolm about it.
It's like the ultimate defence against Mom and Dad, It's totally bullet-proof.
I'm listening.
In Mom and Dad's bedroom, on the nightstand next to Mom's side is a big vanilla candle, have you seen it?
- Yeah - Mom and Dad like to use that candle, when they, uh - lock their door and do grownup stuff.
You mean sex?
I'm afraid so.
Now it's gotten to the point that every time that candle is lit, all they can think about is, going back to their room.
I have never seen it miss.
Wow.
Thanks.
We are now Brothers of the Candle.
Francis, you've got to stop that.
I'll have another Margarita.
Wow, I'm learning a lot tonight.
I never dreamed there were so many ways of saying "thank you".
I wish there were more ways to say "you're not welcome".
Excuse me.
You know what I never have?
A Margarita.
Lois, please.
This is just too tense.
I'm sorry.
I don't have amnesia.
You're the only one who has a problem with this.
You, are one polite old bag, you know that, honey?
Excuse me.
Come here, Oldie.
Give us a hug.
He's cut off.
Hey, that's Kitty Kenarban at your table, right?
Yeah.
So are both of you into the same scene?
You know, sniffsniff, reeeowwwww?
I beg your pardon?
Ahhh, nothing, nothing.
Ahh, listen, um â Could you give this to Kitty?
We were both in the uh, Choir together, and I thought, maybe she'd like to join us for practice sometime?
I'd be happy to.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome beloved PBS Children's TV icon, Frank Walston.
Before we bring out our Guest of Honour, I'd like to say a few words about courtesy.
Now, I know that good manners sometimes seem like just a bunch of dumb old rules our parents invented, so they could scold us You got that right!
but, but, manners are so much more.
Only human beings have a system that reminds us to care about each other.
It is how we live in grace.
Manners are what allow us to be kind to each other, to live with each other, but most importantly, they are how we forgive each other.
and in the end they allow us to listen to the voices of our bitter angels.
Now, can I tell you Kitty, please forgive me.
well, the best part is yet to come.
So, let us give a warm, courtesy welcome, to this year's gallant.
No goof is he.
Our own Stevie Kenarban.
"Ladies and gentlemen, friends and family, esteemed colleagues of courtesy, you honor me.
But I can't let this occasion pass without remarking that you all blow-blow-blow-blow.
It means so much and requires so little to take a moment to kiss my butt.
In conclusion, I feel the evening would be incomplete without telling that world that I am actually a lady.
Thank you, Go to Hell.
He can talk!
He's cured!
Reese, your punishment isn't over until that bathroom floor is so clean you can eat off it which is what you're going to be doing for the next two weeks.
And get rid of that thing, it's disgusting.
Disgusting?
If Malcolm made another him out of hair, you'd be throwing a parade for him right now.
AAAARRRRGGGGHHHH!
Noooo!
It just took it.
That could have been me.
I need a few minutes alone with the vacuum.
You're supposed to sign this.
Disrupted class?
Insulted the teacher?
Insulted the teacher?
Dewey!
You are in so much â trouble.
Ok, first of all we have to figure out a punishâ uh, punishment.
- That's right, and it's going to be really, really That's nice, honey.
You are going to uh, to Uh, Dewey, we're going to talk about this later.
That's right Lois, there's something in the bedroom.
I've wanted to show you.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Crap!
Pick.
Ass.
Oh.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.06 - Hal's Christmas Gift Relecture par Tyno.
Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com Stupid Christmas vacation.
There's nothing to do.
I wish I cared about something.
Then I could do that.
You missed it!
It was so awesome!
- What?
- Reese just came up with the most fun thing to do.
Riding your bike through the graveyard with your eyes closed.
He smashed into this one gravestone, flew through the air, hit another gravestone and landed in an open grave.
Lying in that hole was surprisingly peaceful.
I no longer fear death.
I've been sitting here bored out of my mind for four hours.
Why didn't you invite me?
Didn't we?
No.
You didn't.
You walked right by me.
I thought you were going out to the garage.
Oh, well.
It's not a big deal.
It's just that my feelings are kind of Oh, crap!
Your what are kind of what?
- Nothing.
Forget it.
- I think someone has feelings, Dewey.
I do not!
We've gotta make this right.
- Group hug?
- Shut up!
Oh, listen to those feelings.
- Come here, you.
- Get away from me!
In our house, that's the "F" word.
Okay, if we get Reese the walkie-talkies with only two channels, we can move $8.20 from his pile to Dewey's pile.
Then Dewey can get the Spider-man figure that sticks to walls.
We have enough stuff that sticks to walls.
Dewey can live with the regular Spider-man.
Just make sure that Malcolm's pile has enough in it Hal, we don't have a pile for Jamie.
Oh, damn it!
- You know, Jamie's not even old enough to know it's Christmas.
We could - Hal.
All right!
But this is ridiculous.
$93 to get gifts for four boys.
Well, it's our own fault.
We just weren't frugal enough.
What else can we do?
We're already doing no-electricity Wednesdays, lunch lotteries, - Family flush.
- Okay, we'll make it work somehow.
Just put it into four piles.
- Hello?
- Hey, Mom, good news.
I decided to come home for Christmas after all.
Francis, that is, um great.
What a nice surprise that you will be coming home for Christmas.
We'll have the whole family here exchanging gifts.
- Piama, too?
- Of course.
We can't wait to see you!
Well, we can't wait to see you.
- Six piles?
- Five.
Piama and Jamie can share.
Excuse me?
I know you didn't think anyone would catch you, but you just slammed your door into my car.
The least you could do is say you're sorry, lady.
You don't have to take that tone.
It's not like I'm hurting your resale value.
I'm sorry.
See?
Like that.
I don't know what happened.
I just lost control of myself.
It was like an out-of-body experience, and I was there watching this woman go insane.
And the woman was me.
But you know what, Hal?
I'd do it all over again.
It felt great.
It was almost worth destroying my car.
Well, honey, the important thing is no cops were there to see it.
No one says a word.
This is my one.
My one to your 11,000.
So, due to unforeseen circumstances, we are now completely broke.
Therefore, I am making a proclamation.
This will be a handmade Christmas.
We're not spending any money on gifts.
They will be homemade, and therefore, more personal and more thoughtful.
- But you can't do this!
- Well, I think it's high time we had a handmade Christmas.
You boys just don't appreciate the holidays.
To you it's nothing but a disgusting orgy of materialism.
- But - No buts!
You're the ones who turned your mother into a ticking time bomb!
Oh, you just thank your lucky stars that she went off on an innocent bystander!
So we had our Christmas feast of oatmeal and hot dog buns.
Since then, we've been waiting three hours for Dad to come out of the garage.
What is taking him so long?
What are you talking about?
Nothing you'd be interested in.
You don't know that.
If it's interesting to you guys, it's gonna be interesting to me.
We were wondering what nose hairs smell like.
Well, that's very interesting!
Hal, hurry up already!
In a minute.
Hal!
All right, everyone over by the tree.
- Open mine first!
- Okay, okay.
Let's see what little Dewey made for his dad.
Where did you find that?
I never take a good picture.
I went through every box in the attic and found that one.
I made the frame with mementos of your hobbies.
Wait.
You made this frame?
Yeah.
See it has a little golf club, a fishing pole, a poker hand.
I even pasted on the Jumble you finished.
Dewey, this is really nice.
- Here, Mom, this is from me.
- Oh, it's so heavy.
Wow!
Reese, are these jams?
And candies.
I had some sugar left over, so I figured, why not, it's Christmas.
- You made this?
!
- Here, Mom.
Here, Dad.
Oh, my God, it's a clock.
You made this?
!
I read up on all-wood clocks and then borrowed the tools from wood shop.
See the gears?
They make different patterns as they turn.
Oh, I'm very impressed, boys.
You all worked so hard on these gifts.
- Open mine next.
It's a sonata I composed for you.
- Oh, I'll get to it.
It's your father's turn to give something.
My gift isn't here.
- Not here?
What do you mean?
Well, we-we knew the boys would really come through with great gifts, and any present that top what they did can't be here can it?
Merry Chris You started without us?
Dad's about to give us a really cool present!
Is it outside?
Let's find out.
Like a treasure hunt?
Wow, Mom, this is fantastic.
I am so happy to be home for Christmas.
You said this house was Satan's trash can.
You're quoting me out of context.
So, Dad, where is it?
Are we supposed to drive to it?
Yes!
Yes!
You guessed the first clue.
Everybody into the van.
Let's go!
- Hal - Merry Christmas, honey!
Are we there yet?
Yeah, where are we going?
I know.
We're going to Disneyland.
It's a thousand times better than Disneyland.
Cool!
What was that?
A handshake.
Now they've got some lame, third-grade secret handshake.
I think I got half of it.
We love Dad!
We love Dad!
We love Dad!
We love Dad!
We love Dad!
Rest stop.
Everybody out.
No eye contact with strangers.
Look at 'em scamper.
- You don't need to?
- No.
- You couldn't have said twice as good as Disneyland?
- You saw those presents, Lois!
What was I supposed to do?
My presents were crap!
- What did you make them?
- Lanyards.
Still better than what I had.
Look, I underestimated these boys, Lois, and they deserve to have a really great Christmas.
How much money do we have?
- Zero.
- No, I mean everything: credit cards, loose change, everything?
- Oh.
Minus $512.
- What?
!
Oh, for God's sakes!
Can you think of a Christmas reason for stopping somewhere I can sell blood?
Oh, Hal, don't worry about it.
It'll be okay.
You just need to find something that's a thousand times better than Disneyland, open on Christmas day and free.
Just because it's hard, Lois, doesn't mean it's impossible.
I am going to make this happen.
Hal, we don't even have enough gas to get home.
Yes, we do.
I did all the calculations, Lois.
We're exactly 40 miles from the point of no return.
And I promise you, I will figure out a plan by then.
If not, I will turn the van around.
Just don't rat me out.
Please, honey.
It's Christmas.
I can't wait much longer.
Mom, is it really going to be as good as Dad says?
Dewey, I think you'll remember this day for a long time.
I think we'll all remember this day for a very long time.
All right, since no one wants to race cigarette butts, I'm outta here.
Francis, I need to talk to you about something.
It's weird, - but lately I kind of feel like I'm being left out by Reese and Dewey.
- Aw, geez.
Look, I'm sorry.
You weren't supposed to know about the beach trip.
- What?
!
- Hey, geez, watch it!
What beach trip?
!
I took Reese and Dewey to the beach last summer.
I would've invited you, but you were over at Stevie's.
He lives two blocks away!
You have to go by his house to get to the beach!
Why is this happening?
I'm the brother everybody likes the best.
What are you talking about?
I'm the brother everybody likes best.
I meant of the brothers who are still at home.
That's Dewey.
- What?
Where am I in the pecking order?
- Malcolm, I am not gonna stand here in a public toilet and rank me, Dewey, Reese, Jamie and you in order of popularity.
So are we getting close?
Now, now.
You're not going to trick me into giving it away.
It's a surprise.
Hal, you are five miles from your point of no return.
Look, I know we don't talk about our emotions, but I don't care anymore.
I'm just going to lay it out there.
My feelings are hurt.
There, I said it.
They're hurt because you guys are systematically excluding me.
Being excluded is extra hard for me because I see all the other places I don't fit in, and we're brothers.
I really want us to be in this together.
What a gasbag.
Your feelings aren't hurt.
Your ego is bruised.
The reason we exclude you sometimes is because you're a drag.
You always have to be the special one.
Even now, this is all about how you feel things more deeply than everyone else.
Look, we love you.
We just need a break from you once in a while.
- Okay, Hal - Francis, can I see you up here for a second, please?
I need your help with the radio.
- What are you?
- I need to borrow $1,800.
I'll pay you back over the next six years in monthly payments of $39.50.
I have no money to give these boys a Christmas gift and I'm not even sure where I'm driving.
I hate to ask you, but I don't know what else to do.
I love you.
Well I guess this is as good a time as any to tell you.
- I got fired from my job.
I'm totally broke.
- What?
- You got fired from the ranch?
- It turns out the ATM I was making all of Otto's deposits into wasn't an ATM.
So sue me, right?
Anyway, he's suing me.
- I don't know what we're going to do.
- You're not moving back in!
- There isn't room enough in the house!
- Besides, Piama doesn't want to live with us.
Piama doesn't even know about it.
She thinks I'm on vacation.
- I've been acting like the happiest man in the world the last few weeks just to hide it from her.
- I have to say, I am a little disappointed in you, Francis.
You can't hide something like this from the ones you love.
Honesty: it's the cornerstone of any healthy relationship.
Well, I'm sorry I can't help you.
Okay, Hal, it's been 40 miles.
We are at the point of no return.
Hal, turn around.
Let's get out and stretch your legs!
You're coming Malcom?
You're sure?
I might accidently talk about myself.
You mean like just now?
- Hal what are you doing, - I'm buying time.
I don't know how you gotta be along with this but that's it!
The Christmas lie is over.
- 60 more seconds, Lois.
You can time me.
- I'm not!
Fine.
Whoa, nice rides.
Yeah.
The fat lady at the car wash rides one of these.
- Nice going, Dewey!
- I wasn't even touching it.
It was you!
What'd you do, man?
!
Wait, wait!
Those guys didn't do it.
What are you talking about?
I'm not going to let these people take the blame when they didn't do it.
It was my dad.
He was trying to teach me a lesson so I wouldn't grow up and be like you.
Malcolm, oh, my God, that was awesome!
- That was so cool!
- Thanks!
Okay, honey, you've got 20 seconds.
Lois, there is going to be a Christmas!
Hal, no!
Oh, no!
I seem to have slipped in an oil stain left here by a negligent owner or employee.
Hal!
Oh, my God!
Are you okay?
Yes, damn it!
Oh, thank goodness.
I don't have any insurance.
We both dodged a bullet.
After I sweep this up, you're getting wiper blades on the house.
Hal You know what?
- I saw a trail behind here that leads up into the hills.
There's probably something really great up there.
All we need is a few flashlights to get started.
- Hal, it's time for you to face the boys and tell them what's going on.
Hal, they're good boys.
They forgave you for banjo camp; they'll forgive you for this.
And I will try sharing the blame with you, but honey, this has got your fingerprints all over it.
- You know, you're a pretty good brother after all.
- Thanks.
You look cold.
Take my jacket.
I think I could've handled those bikers, but with a baby and a chick around, you probably did the right thing, Malcolm.
Thanks for thinking of us, Reese.
What's this?
Nothing.
Give me that.
It's a credit card receipt from The Clockworks.
You bought those clocks?
You have a credit card?
Since when?
They sent it to me in the mail a couple months ago.
They must've thought I was old enough after I won that physics award.
So when I superglued my eyelids shut, and I was in the emergency room, we could've used your credit card instead of having to call Mom?
!
I'm not going to let you jeopardize my credit rating.
I want to buy a house someday.
Malcolm, you're a jerk.
Mom, Malcolm has a credit card, and he bought you Christmas presents with it.
What?
Malcolm, you bought those presents, after everything I've been through?
We all worked so hard to make this a special Christmas, and you just took a cheap shortcut!
- Those clocks cost 50 bucks each!
- I don't care what they cost!
This isn't a competition, Malcolm.
You know, all I really want from you on Christmas is this!
I forgive you, son.
Okay, everybody, listen up.
I don't want this to ruin our trip.
- You wanna know where we're going?
- Yeah!
Snow skiing on Mount Bundy!
That's a room for the night, ski passes and equipment rentals.
Will you be putting that on your credit card?
Let's give it a shot.
Oh, yes!
In your face!
Hal, this is the low point, isn't it?
We're not going to sink any further, are we?
- What are you talking about?
- You've stolen our son's credit card.
If it weren't for my rage and your recklessness, our kids might have a fighting chance.
Lois, those are the exact things that make us great parents.
If it wasn't for your anger and my recklessness, we wouldn't be on this amazing ski vacation, would we?
You know, this just might be our best Christmas ever.
Francis, I want you to quit your job.
- What?
- Ever since we left on this trip, you've just seemed so insanely happy.
I can't let you go back to that job.
You've got to find something else to do.
You're right.
You know, in fact, let's not even go back to that ranch.
I'll call Otto in the morning, and if he doesn't understand, tough.
Okay, so who wants some hot chocolate by the fire, huh?
- Enjoy your stay, Malcolm.
- Thanks.
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
I think I'll get another cup of tea.
B-K-U-J-I-R "Jirpku", a small phyllis bird from southern Africa.
Love you, son.
Go ahead and blow off curfew this weekend.
Well, well, well, look what we have here, I was just reading about one of these "Jirpku" isn't a real word, but "azsquip" isn't a viking toothpaste, but mom got 162 points for it.
Special thanks to @DBfansub I gotta get to work.
You make sure your father gets out of bed.
I don't know why, but he hasn't slept for the last four nights.
So, if you have to, yell 'fire'.
If that doesn't work, set one.
Whawhy would your mother buy me pants without a zipper?
!
Dad, you have them on backwards.
Malcolm, I need your help.
Our 20th anniversary is coming up, and I've been going crazy trying to think of the perfect gift for your mother.
It has got to be something really fantastic, and I've got nothing!
Maybe you're trying too hard.
Why don't you just do something simple?
You know, get a bottle of champagne, watch a sunset, recite a poem to her.
So, you just use the genius thing on yourself, is that it, son?
Come on!
This anniversary has got to make up for 19 crappy celebrations.
You have no idea the hell I've put that woman through.
I wish I could say that was the low point of the day.
Chad, are you trying to make Coach Cleary burst in flames again?
Hey, Dewey, you won't believe it.
It's the most amazing thing ever!
We made friends with a normal kid.
He spoke to us and everything!
It was Calm down.
Just breathe, ok?
All this time, we thought he hated us.
Who is it?
Kyle Rogers.
He likes us so much, that he put both our names in to run for Student Body President.
He said he can't wait to hear our campaign speeches.
Really?
Yes!
I feel like I'm in a dream.
Except there isn't an armless scarecrow who can't stop crying.
This is so great!
But we'll have to promise that we'll both stay friends, no matter what happens.
Don't worry, Zoe.
We won't let anything come between us.
Even though we're both competing for this great honour.
Hey Dewey, what did you do?
Rat me out to Mr Myers?
Of course not.
I just figured that if you're so interested in the democratic process, I nominate you to run for school president, too.
What?
I've got to admit, it's clever making Hanson and Zoe run for Office.
They're going to be humiliated.
The only thing more humiliating would be losing to them.
Ow!
Leave it alone!
No-one can even see a zit back there!
Just stop squirming, so I can clean it.
You know, a little more effort on your personal grooming wouldn't kill you.
Sunday nights before bed, your father goes over every square inch of his body with a hand mirror.
Oh my god!
Do you remember that summer seminar in Arizona that I applied for last year?
Yeah, you didn't get it.
I know, but somehow my name was entered as an alternate for a Study in Europe program.
The guy who was supposed to go was bitten by a tick, and now basically lives in a hyperbaric chamber.
So, I get to go in his place!
Slow down, Malcolm.
We can't afford to help you with that.
That's just it!
It's all paid for!
I'm going to Paris, Prague, Munich, Vienna.
I'm going to be staying in castles!
This is an incredible opportunity.
This is the luckiest thing that's ever happened to me!
I have to do something to protect it.
What?
It's like, I feel I should balance it out, somehow.
You know, give something back, so I don't lose it.
Listen to you.
Something wonderful happens and all you can think about is how the world's going to take it away.
You're growing up.
You!
Come with me.
What are you doing?
Dad, you have to understand.
The reason I missed so many days of school, was that the calendar on my watch stopped.
I thought it was Saturday all week.
Put it on the shelf.
The watch?
You want me Don't know what I'm going to do your mother it's horrible.
Well, I don't know.
You married her.
What about our anniversary?
It won't fit!
What about the anniversary?
What are you talking about?
It's got to be the best.
Where is it?
Are you still asleep?
The dogs were right.
I got to get her a great present!
Dad, your shoe's untied.
Of course!
Thank you.
Yeah, you are going to have to get her a good present.
She's a great lady.
In fact, I don't know why, but she wants you to give me $20.
That's good, that's good.
She'll know what to do.
Thanks.
I don't know the answer.
Tell me.
Tell me, now!
Ok, calm down.
I think you're going to have more success if you can relax, make me a B.L.T. with avocado, and open up a bag of chips.
Then you can sit at my feet and purr while I eat.
That's it!
What are you talking about?
!
You have to vote for me!
All those rumours you've heard are lies!
I don't want to have school on Saturdays!
I don't wear Pull-Ups!
I'm glad to see you're so pumped about the election, Kyle.
A lot of kids think they're too hip for Student Government.
But I think you'll find out how excited you can be, when you organise your first Recycling Drive You know what, Zoe?
I actually hope you win.
Thanks, Hanson.
And I hope you win.
Of course, I can't speak for Bad Zoe.
Ok, Chad.
See those kids over there?
They're friends of Kyle's.
On Election Day, it would probably be better if they didn't vote.
Ok.
Why don't you go back inside?
You don't want to see this.
Hey, Mom?
You know when I said I was going to give something back?
Well, I was thinking.
Maybe I could work at a Homeless Shelter, teach some kids how to read.
But then it came to me.
I bought a guitar!
What?
It's perfect!
I mean, Dewey has this incredible music talent.
I must have it too, I just haven't tried it yet.
How long do you have to return it?
Fifteen days.
I'm not going to return it.
Well, that'll be long enough for you to figure out that you can't do this.
What are you talking about?
I can play music if I want to.
I'm sorry honey, you can't.
Your brain doesn't work that way.
You don't have that kind of creative spark.
What?
See, Dewey is a flyer.
He'll just drift and float through life, and things will turn out for him.
Now, you and I, we're burrowers.
We're at our best when our heads are down, and we're grinding through a mountain of drudgery.
You don't know that.
Yes, I do.
You actually think you know what I'd be good at before I even try it?
!
That's right.
Oh, really?
Then tell me!
How would I be at scuba diving, or mountain climbing, or Flamenco dancing.
Bad at scuba diving, good at mountain climbing.
Flamenco dancing, a disaster.
I'm not trying to hurt your feelings, I'm just telling you what I know.
It's a good thing you weren't John Lennon's mother!
If I were John Lennon's mother, he'd still be alive.
Hey, Reese.
Hey, Dad.
Oh, here.
Got you a new watch.
Thanks.
What did you do that for?
I don't know.
A thought just popped into my head that you needed one.
And you have no idea why?
No.
Wow.
You've got to see this.
I finally found the perfect anniversary present for your Mom.
She had this exact music box when we were first married.
Until your brother Francis got a hold of it, and smashed it into a million pieces.
Anyway, I'm walking through this antique store in complete desperation, and there it is, the same music box.
Oh, what a relief.
I am going to sleep like a baby tonight.
I have fifteen days to learn how to play this thing well enough to totally humiliate my Mom.
Seems doable.
I'm willing to forget I ever saw this, if you tell me everything you know about sleepwalking.
Sleepwalking?
Well, all I know is it's a dissociative state, which basically is Just tell me what causes it.
Well, there's a few things.
It usually happens when a person is under intense, emotional or psychological stress.
So, if a sleepwalker stays stressed out, he'll continue sleepwalking?
I don't know, probably.
Beautiful.
Who's a little carpenter?
Jamie's a little carpenter!
You come with me.
I had it!
The giftperfectdestroyed!
That little one.
Bad diapers!
Come on, Hal.
What happened, happened.
The main thing is, I'm here to help.
Need help, can't do it alone.
Now, tomorrow you'll be on your way to work, when you'll realise that your favourite son, Reese, is completely out of hair care products.
So you'll put together a charming gift basket full of shampoos and styling gels.
It has to be done!
No questions!
Get to work!
It's interesting you'd say that.
Because actually, there are quite a few projects I've lined up for you.
Oh, but first, I'd like you to do something very important for me.
Important!
Of course, it's important.
Yes, it is.
I want you to kiss this.
You know, like you really mean it.
Let's be friends!
Yes, yes, I'll hold, thank you.
I hate politics!
The voters don't read, they don't think for themselves.
They're completely swayed by the last thing they heard, whether it's true or not.
Democracy is a failure, because let's face it, people are idiots.
I think you'd feel better about the world, Dewey, if you had a programmable zombie robot.
That's right, I'm looking to replace the music box with the ballerina on top I wouldn't say broken so much as vaporized, my toddler got a hold of it.
Oh-oh-oh, give me that!
So, anyway, I would really appreciate it if you could help me.
A list of local distributors who might have one What are you talking about, why on earth would I do that?
!
Listen, the truth is I'm pretty desperate here, so if you could just give me some information that can help me track down another ballerina music box, you can actually turn this into a very special anniversary celebration.
Sorry, I am late.
Oh, please!
Like the orphans would really see any of the money I would give you.
Do you have an orphan there with you?
Could I speak to one, please?
I didn't think so.
Do you know what?
You people make me sick!
Damn telemarketers!
Hal, you know what I realised on the way home?
Our 20th anniversary is in 3 days.
Oh, just 3 days, huh?
Boy, talk about time flying.
It'll be here before you know it.
have to do something special.
She totally did!
I saw her, I swear!
He's a liar, vote for me!
Stop screaming at me!
You're not my Guidance Counsellor!
Guys, guys, calm down.
What's going on?
Zoe thinks she'd make a better president than me, even though it's a known fact that she eats her own hair lice!
Oh yeah?
Well, I wonder how the voters would feel if they knew that Hanson likes to french-kiss his poodle.
And I know, because dogs don't lie to me.
What are you doing?
I thought you two were going to stay friends, no matter what.
Oh, wake up, Dewey!
There's a little too much at stake here to play that game!
Stop it!
The truth is, you two were nominated as a joke.
You had a chance to show the rest of the school that you were better than Kyle and his friends.
Now you're no different than they are.
We used to be a team.
You two and the four of me.
We have no idea who you are any more.
You guys do what you want.
I'm sick of this.
Hal, you didn't even touch your pie.
No, I'm saving that for Reese.
I have something I want you guys to hear.
I've been practicing.
Really practicing a lot.
And I had an idea for a song.
I don't know if it's any good or not, but it really means something to me.
Do you mind if I play it for you?
Of course not, Malcolm.
We'd love to hear it.
No one knows just what I've been through, I can't stop the pain inside me.
Now I'm staring out my window, Children play, they seem so happy.
Why are we here, going nowhere?
Why does my life feel so empty?
Meow, meow, meow, meow What are you doing?
That's the Meow Mix song.
No-one knows just what I've been through, meow, meow, meow Now I'm staring out the window, meow, meow, meow, meow..
I want chicken I want liver, Meow Mix, Meow Mix, please deliver.
Now you know that cat meow means Meow Mix, Meow Mix Ok, stop it!
God, I've just spent two days of my life rewriting the Meow Mix song.
I poured my heart into this.
I actually got tears in my eyes writing it.
How pathetic is that?
I clearly have even less talent than you gave me credit for.
Should we tell him the kid recovered from the tick bite, and the trip to Europe's off?
No, let him return the guitar first.
Gotta get this it has to Ok, let's see what you've got here.
These aren't even letters.
Why did I think a zombie could write an essay on Johnny Tremain?
Come on, we might as well go to bed.
No, don't!
Wait!
Have to get an answer!
Dad, I'm not gonna be able to help you with an idea for Mom.
And the other ideas I have for you are just gonna land us in jail.
You can help!
You're the one I can talk to.
You're my guy!
Really?
I thought Malcolm was your favorite.
Smart one scares me.
You're normal, like me.
Is that why you grab me?
You're my guy.
I don't care if everyone thinks this election is a joke.
I'm not screwing around any more, you've gotta vote for me, please!
Whatever you heard about me is all lies!
Hey, Dewey.
Hi.
I've been thinking about what you said.
You're right, we are better than these jerks.
I'm going to throw the election so Zoe will win.
She'll become popular, then she can tell us what we're missing, instead of us having to imagine it.
How are you going to do that?
I haven't slept in two days, and I've been staring into a strobe light for the last 20 minutes.
It's time for everyone else to meet the Hanson that until now, only the paramedics have seen.
What are you smiling at, Hooper?
!
I'm not kidding, vote for me, damn it, just do it!
Ok, thank you, Kyle.
And now for our next candidate, David Hanson.
Good afternoon, fahfah teachers and stustustu..
I'm offeringboo and I say to you son of a  If I'm elected  the cafeteria's !
and I promise to And erase this food Charge a man with a. ï¼ and  a victory for , you big !
I promise to  my , and I will work hard to Hanson!
Hanson!
Hanson!
Reese, what do you think you're you doing?
Look, there's something you should know.
Dad's been sleepwalking every night for the past week.
He's in the kitchen right now, making me paella.
What are you talking about?
It's because he's stressed out about picking a present for your anniversary.
Oh, you're kidding.
Don't worry, right now he'll do anything you say, and he won't even remember the conversation the next day.
So, you can go out there, and end his suffering.
He's a good man.
Treat him right.
Oh, and don't make him drink out of the toilet.
It's not as satisfying as you think.
Hal?
No, not now!
Have to think!
Nothing!
I've got nothing!
I know you've been very worried about our anniversary.
You can't find out about this!
Don't worry, I won't.
Of course, this is the 20th, and that's very special.
It has to bethe best.
So, listen carefully.
Here are the gifts that Lois has been dreaming of.
A 3-pack of vacuum cleaner bags, a new heating pad, oh and some of those gel inserts for her work shoes, size 9.
That's it!
Yes!
Oh, finally!
The relief!
And one more thing.
There's nothing you love more than changing Jamie's poopy diapers.
You got that right.
I returned the guitar.
Mom was right, I don't have any of Dewey's talent.
But it's ok, I'm good at a lot of other things.
I've learned a little something about myself, and I feel good.
Ow!
Vacuum cleaner bags?
Hal, this is uncanny, this is exactly what I was hoping for.
How on earth did you know?
Come on, honey.
When you've been married as long as we have, it's like being a psychic.
I just know.
Oh, man!
I think Jamie has a present for someone.
I got it!
Oh, I've been waiting for this all day!
Come on, buddy!
Oh yeah!
Happy anniversary, Mom.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Mr. Hawkins?
It's Hal.
Remember a few weeks ago, in the break room, when someone left the tin foil on their burrito and the microwave caught fire and the sprinklers went off and shorted out all the computers and we lost all our database for the last five years?
Yeah, well, I just thought you might like to know who the "slack-jawed idiot" was.
Dad, Dad, you need four apples, not three!
You only won another lottery ticket!
It was Phil in accounting.
He feels just awful about it, and I wouldn't be too hard on him.
His wife's a bit of a drinker, and she's not particularly faithful Malcolm in the Middle - 6.08 - Lois Battles Jamie Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com I'm starving.
I hope Mom has something decent for dinner.
I saw her pulling baloney stew out of the freezer last night.
Don't worry.
I stuck a bloody Band-Aid in it before we left.
Holy crap.
Look at that!
Cool!
A diving board!
Oh my God.
This is the greatest thing ever.
And someone just dumped it here for us to find.
We've got to take it home!
What are we gonna do with it?
I don't know.
But look at it!
It's it's got the and it's up and and bounce and and bounce!
He's right.
We need it.
One, two, three go!
One, two, three go!
One, two, three, go!
One, two, three, go!
Aah, Jamie, this is ridiculous!
You'll eat dead bugs out of the zapper, for God's sake, why won't you eat your peas?
You love peas!
Come on.
This is name-brand stuff.
It's three times the price of the food I eat!
If you want to breathe, you have to open your mouth.
See?
There's no reason for Now you're just going to have to eat some eyebrow, too.
Hi, honey.
Didn't you have the same fight with him at breakfast?
This is the same fight as breakfast.
It's the same jar of peas and it's the same stubborn little boy who is not gonna get his own way.
That baby thinks he is gonna break me, but he doesn't know who he's dealing with.
Hal, I'm not about to lose it with a God, how does he do that?
One, two, three, go!
Please, we have to stop.
I have to empty the blood out of my shoes again.
One last time.
One, two, three, go!
This is gonna be so great!
This is the answer.
What's the question?
I don't know yet, but this is definitely the answer.
Would you look at this?
Jamie poured flour in the dryer.
Now I get to wear a loaf of bread to work tomorrow.
He destroys everything!
He's absolutely the worst kid we have ever had!
Oh, you say that with every kid.
Let's face it, Lois.
It's just the hand we were dealt.
God just doesn't like us.
That doesn't make us bad people.
No, there's something different with Jamie.
He's not like the other ones.
I'm telling you,I can see it in his eyes.
Honey, calm down.
You know what will make you feel better?
You take a look at him while he's sleeping.
You know how cute he is, with his tush all squished up in the air like that Did you see him?
See who?
That-a-way!
We're in lockdown!
This door stays closed till you hear the all-clear call.
The perimeter's sealed.
He's not getting out this way.
My jewelry box!
Jamie, Mommy told you All right, Jamie, you've had your fun.
Now it's time to give that back to Mommy and go to sleep.
Jamie I asked you to give it to me!
Would you look at this thing?
It's amazing.
We've got to come up with something really great to do with it.
What if we tied mattresses to ourselves and jumped off it?
Nah.
We could do that off the roof.
We could launch mannequins into the Prestons' Jacuzzi.
Uh-uh.
It's not good enough.
We could get a squirrel to dive off it into a cup of water.
Not good enough.
Not for her.
Not this old beauty.
Well, how about if we got a vat of Jell-O No!
It's not good enough!
I got it!
We take a dog, tie him to a bicycle No!
It's just not good enough!
Mom's home early!
You do not pinch, you do not poke, you do not bite, you do not spit, you do not eye-gouge, you do not vomit intentionally on other babies!
A lifetime ban from Gymboree!
A lifetime ban!
I can't believe it.
She didn't even see the board.
This is a sign we were meant to have this.
We were meant to do something really, really great with you.
It'll come.
We just have to be patient.
No!
This is Mommy's purse!
You can't have it!
Please, it's the only thing in the house that's Mommy's!
Lois Well, he has a million toys.
Why does he only want to take my things?
Honey, honey, you're taking this too personally.
He doesn't understand what he's doing.
He's just a baby.
Look, if you just give it to him for just a couple of minutes, he'll get tired of it.
You're right.
I guess I was just feeling that if I gave in to him, he'd see it as a sign of weakness.
- I'm going to stop this right now.
- Yeah.
Here, sweetie.
Mommy's purse.
You can have that for five minutes, okay?
I thought you said he wasn't eating anything.
It's mocking us.
It's a ten-foot-tall springboard that we got for free, and we can't think of a single thing that's good enough to do with it!
I bet it belonged to some other family that went crazy because they couldn't come up with anything to do with it.
They probably just sat around, staring at it for months, until they finally snapped and started eating each other.
Damn it, we're better than this!
I know we are!
Remember that squashed groundhog we found on the highway?
We came up with a hundred things to do with that, from the horrible to the beautiful!
I miss Flatty.
Maybe we're just going about this the wrong way.
We have to think outside the box.
If you were a diving board, what would you want someone to do with you?
Take me ice-skating.
Don't be an idiot.
That place is freezing, and it's always so crowded.
Yeah, but they have good hot dogs.
Those hot dogs suck compared to the ones at the train station.
Why would a diving board want to go to a train station?
How should I know?
Maybe he wants to visit a relative.
Okay!
Okay!
Back in the box.
Jamie doesn't have to eat his peas anymore.
He can eat whatever he wants because Mommy surrenders.
Mommy has a tiny pony for Jamie who wants to hug him and give him yummy candy corn Mmm, I'm delicious!
Is there a big boy who could eat me?
Gotcha, you little Jamie tries to kill Mom, and we're the ones who have to clean it up.
You want to tell me how that's fair?
You gotta give that kid some credit.
It's the closest any of us actually ever came.
Yeah.
Jamie wasn't really spawned by Satan, was he?
No.
If he was, we'd have a way better house.
You're the one, Jamie.
Show me the way!
There's a lot of things I can handle.
A lot of things I've managed to survive.
I'd even say I've thrived where others would have just thrown in the towel.
Yes, honey, you certainly have.
Now relax, and let the bubbles do their work.
Soothing.
- Sooth - Dad, we finish I told you to stay the hell away from this bathroom until I said so!
This is a child-free zone until further notice!
Soothing soothing You know what, Hal?
I'm done.
I give up.
What are you talking about?
Jamie wins.
He beat me.
All those years, all those terrible things those kids have done.
It doesn't make me stronger, it's just worn me down.
Like termites eating away at a house, until all that's holding up is paint.
I'm just paint, Hal.
Jamie knows it.
You'll do a better job than I can.
I trust you.
No, no, no.
No-no-no-no-no-no!
You can't leave me alone with those kids!
We had a deal, Lois!
You are in charge of the spiritual and emotional development, discipline and scary injuries.
I kill spiders, mark their heights on the door frames and supply car snacks.
You walk out now and the whole system falls apart!
I can't do it, Hal.
I don't want to.
I just don't have it anymore.
I mean, it's normal, right?
People give up, they quit Lois, you listen to me.
No one is as good as you are.
You took those vicious little fiends, and you twisted and crushed them into submission.
And you didn't do it because you had to.
You did it because you loved the game, and it was beautiful!
I just don't have that anymore.
Honey, yes, you do.
I know you do.
You just lost your way a little.
You just need to think.
Think back to the first time you found that spark.
There's got to be some way to remember.
And I'm going to help you.
So, here I am.
Dad said you needed some help on something?
Francis, your father and I are trying to remember something, and we really need your help.
We'd like you to think back to your earliest memories.
What's this all about?
Mind your own business.
Just do it, will ya?
You've got to be kidding me.
My childhood was a nightmare!
I've spent the rest of my life trying to board up that haunted house.
Francis, this is important.
I really need to remember something, and I don't know what it is.
- But - Please.
You're the only one who can help me.
My earliest memories It's kind of vague.
I remember we had that apartment I remember it being really colorful.
Come on, Francis, honey.
Please, won't you eat anything?
We've tried the carrots, and the peaches, and the oatmeal, the apples, huh?
Don't you like anything?
Lois!
Would you like to know what your son did to my director's cut of The Eyes of Laura Mars?
He also shaved a hole in the carpet with my new Norelco!
I'm sorry, Hal.
I asked him very nicely not to play with it, but he just wouldn't listen.
I can't get him to do anything.
I've read Dr. Spock and Piaget and Eisenberg, and The Language of Hugs, all these books, nothing's helping.
What he needs is a little discipline.
I think he'd behave better if he just ate something.
Look at him.
He's just wasting away.
I'm going to give him another Hershey bar.
Lois, no!
You can't keep coddling him like this!
I am sick and tired of always having to be the bad cop because you're constantly giving in to him.
Okay, Hal, I'll try.
You keep saying that, and then you do it again!
I'm going to be tougher with him.
I promise.
Huh.
It's weird.
I just have this vague feeling of you actually being a good mother.
I hate you!
I hate you, I hate you!
I hate you!
Reese, this is crazy.
You've been staring at that damn thing for four days.
We're getting rid of it.
No!
Wait!
I finally have an idea.
What is it?
I'll have it in a second!
Just wait!
It's over, Reese.
Once the board's gone, things should go back to normal.
Did you know that the Newmans put a statue of a naked guy on their front lawn a week ago?
We should be ashamed of ourselves.
No!
We are not getting rid of this!
Reese, what is the big deal?
What is so special about this board?
I think it's my last time.
Last time for what?
For anything stupid and reckless and fun.
Maybe it's because I'm almost 18 now, but lately I've been hearing this voice in my head that says, "That's dangerous, that's stupid.
You're gonna hurt yourself".
And the old voice, the one that says, "This is fun.
Do it anyways.
They'll figure out how to save you".
It just gets quieter and quieter.
Pretty soon I won't be able to hear it at all.
But before it dies, I want to say good-bye to it the right way.
We'll give it the best send-off any crazy voice could ever ask for.
I'd do it for mine.
and then, right around the time I was starting to walk, there was some kind of AhI don't know.
Let's stop.
I want to stop.
Honey, please, keep going.
You can't stop now.
No, I don't want to.
We've been sitting here for five hours.
Why are we doing this, anyway?
Francis, please.
I think we're really close.
Just one more time.
Well I kind of remember that Frisbee game we used to play Okay, honey.
Maybe we'll eat later.
Lois, did you see what he did in there?
He used my tennis racket to smash my camera and all my lenses to bits!
I still had film in it from the Us Festival!
Where is he?
Hal, it's not his fault!
I'm pretty sure he's working through a limitation-anxiety phase.
All the literature says this is the age where he's trying You cannot undermine me every time I try to discipline him!
I can't help it.
He's so small, and helpless I can't take any more of this!
It is tearing our marriage apart!
For his own good, you have got to buckle down!
Do you understand me, Lois?
You have to find some way to be this boy's mother!
Hello, Dr. Sachs?
It's Lois again.
I know I just called, but my husband yelled at me again about being stricter with Francis, and I wanted to know if you could write me a note that says yelling at him could damage his psyche?
It's such a tender time for Francis.
He's so fragile and unformed and I just want to make sure I get it right, but everything I do feels wrong.
If this is all supposed to be so natural, why can't I get this?
I love him so much and I want to be a good mother and I know I have to be stronger, but I just don't think I can look in his eyes and not give him what he wants.
He has such a sweet little face and he's so innocent.
I'm going to have to call you back.
Fire is dangerous.
Fire can hurt you.
Fire can kill you.
I will not let that happen.
Let me make one thing clear.
I love you, and I will do whatever I have to to take care of you, and keep you safe and happy and alive.
I don't care if you grow up to hate me, but you will understand this: I will do anything.
That is how much I love you.
Yes.
That's right.
It's coming back to me; that sense of strength and power, and purpose I finally knew who I was, and what I was born to be.
Honey, you're back!
I knew you could do it!
Mr. Fuzzles!
Thank you, Francis.
You can go now.
What?
What is it?
We've got something for you.
Dewey and I finally came up with something good enough for that insane voice in your head.
-Here, put this on first.
-Roman candles?
Well, that's how they started off.
We decided to give 'em a little more oomph.
Do you care if you keep your eyebrows?
-Hell, no!
Okay, the fuse is timed for 20 seconds.
You're gonna light it, and then get up on the board and jump.
The rockets should kick in around there.
They won't give you any momentum, but they will ignite that.
Hopefully, you will land in that kiddie pool.
We think that's got a 50-50 shot of putting you out.
If the roof doesn't collapse.
Or ignite.
And it's all gonna be caught on that video camera.
It has a direct feed to the Internet.
You're the featured page on GiantJackass.com.
This is more than anything I could have ever asked for.
Nobody deserves it more than you.
Should I get the hose?
Not yet.
He would've wanted us to wait.
Good boy.
You finished all your peas!
Hey, slugger.
Guess what.
The clinic called.
They said my ass was a perfect match for your hand.
They can start the skin grafts next week.
Reese, what do you think you're doing?
-What?
He loves the stuff.
He goes through three or four cans a day.
I don't know how he does it.
Half a can makes me nuts.
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Look tickle monster!
He's going to get you.
Honey, you can stop looking for the car keys.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.09 - Malcolm's Car Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com - You are going to be so proud of me.
- Why?
I spent the last five nights in a chat room reeling in this creep named Heinrich.
I got his address and showed up at his house with a printed transcript of our conversations.
He calls me "Sugarbuns" 15 times on nine separate occasions.
Reese So the guy starts crying, "What about my wife?
What about my kids?
I'll do anything".
Entrapment.
It's not just for police anymore.
- Why do I care about this?
- The guy works at the racetrack.
He's going to make bets for us on the horses we pick.
Well, the horses you pick.
This is tomorrow's racing form.
You'll pick the winners and I'll place the bets, we split the winnings 50-50, like brothers.
- That's kind of nice.
- Yeah.
I got to keep this guy on his toes.
Time to leave a suspicious message on his answering machine.
Wow, blackmailing a pervert to facilitate underage gambling.
How could this not work out?
It did work out.
It's been four days and Reese and I have already won almost $300.
I can't believe it.
Reese's plans usually end up with a missing toe or something.
Since when do you buy lunch?
Oh, well, I've been making some extra money at work.
There's an incentive program at work, we're given bonuses for finding inefficiencism, it's really improve morale at the store.
You know, I actually enjoy going to work now that everybody is Whoa!
Jeez, are you okay?
Trying to finish what God started?
I'm sorry, I didn't see the curb.
I was distracted by that Do you believe this?
What happened?
I was half way through my haircut when Troy casually mentioned that his price had gone up from $21 to $28.
And he thought I would just sit there and take it.
Well, I showed him, Hal.
I got up and I walked right out of there.
This is extortion, pure and simple.
What are you going to do about?
- Here, even it up.
- What?
- I can't walk around like this.
Cut it.
- No, I couldn't.
Hal, it doesn't have to look good.
Just hack this side off.
Even it up.
Oh, my God.
This is beautiful, Hal.
You've never done this before?
No, I guess I just have a knack for it.
Lois, I didn't think it was possible, but you are even more stunning than ever.
Oh, Hal.
- What in the?
- This is my new car.
I bought it.
Now, I know what you're thinking, but please just give me 45 seconds to explain why this is the perfect car for me and how it was such and insanely great deal that I had no choice but to buy it.
Hey, there's some black gooey stuff leaking out of it.
I know it looks fast and dangerous, but that's a good thing.
Cops will have their eye on my car, so I'll be extra motivated to drive safe and slow.
It didn't cost much, so I'll have enough to pay for the first year's insurance.
Think of all the money you'll save from less wear and tear on your car, - since I won't have to drive it anymore.
- I can put my finger through the metal.
Dewey, get out of there!
I'll be able to work extra shifts since I won't have to ride in with you, which means I'll be bringing more money into the house.
Oh, and I love it.
I know you don't care, but it just needed to be said.
Malcolm, the fact that you even want this so bad should have been your first clue that this is - Lois.
- Hal, he's not Look, every boy has to go through this.
It's the only way they find out what's important in a car.
Look, let's go.
I need to feather your neckline a little bit.
Where were you?
We were supposed to meet Heinrich right after lunch to get our bets in.
Today was totally wasted.
Although he did buy me a swimsuit.
I got a car, Reese.
I finally have a car.
It's the coolest thing I've ever seen.
It's a piece of crap.
Don't listen to him.
You're magnificent.
Lois, your hair looks beautiful.
She's right, Lois.
It's fantastic.
Thank you.
I've been getting compliments all day.
It looks so much better.
Yeah, I thought you were trapped in the '70s with that old cut.
And your head doesn't look so boxy anymore.
Lois?
What did you do to your hair?
I love it.
Fred, isn't it fantastic?
Mm-hmm.
- Who's your stylist?
- My husband did it.
- Really?
Where's his shop?
- He doesn't have one.
I just got the scissors out of the drawer and, I don't know, he just got inspired.
Amazing.
Okay, ladies, we're agreed.
Lois looks beautiful.
Now, let's get back to work.
I got a job to do, too, honey.
Good evening, Fred.
There goes the soul of this store.
- And it keeps your nose from taking over your face.
- Yeah, thanks.
- So I'll see you tonight?
- I wouldn't miss it.
Lois, you've got to help me.
What?
- I need you to cover the rest of my shift for me.
- Again?
Craig, what's going on?
Paula wants to surprise Fred for their anniversary.
He's a big golfer, so she wants to learn how, so I've been giving her lessons.
You don't know how to golf.
True, but somehow she got the idea that I only missed the cut at the Masters by three strokes.
- You lied to her?
- Lois, my job here is hanging by a thread.
I thought if I could help the boss's wife surprise him with a game of golf, they'd end up kissing on the 18th green, and maybe I'd be in there somewhere getting the credit for it.
Or you could just work hard at your job and then you wouldn't have to suck up.
Lois, I don't have time for your fantasies.
I'm in trouble here.
The first few lessons we worked on driving the cart, but now she wants to know how to swing a club.
I need to take a lesson so I can bluff my way through her lessons.
- Craig - Please, Lois.
I can't lose this job.
This is the only true thing on my resume.
All right, but I'm only Feldspar!
I want all those 50-pound bags of dog food out on the floor before I get back from the warehouse.
I'm on it.
Thanks, Lois.
Sorry I'm late, Hal.
The grocery store was Hi, Lois.
- Hal, what are you doing?
- Just giving Margie a new look.
- I had to have him do me.
Your husband's a genius.
- And I get to keep the hair.
Now where was I?
Oh, my sister.
Honestly, a beach condo on her salary.
Who is she trying to impress?
She's just so insecure, she always has been.
Every year she sends a Christmas card with a picture of her family sitting on a sailboat.
It's not even theirs.
Uh, Lois.
Do you have to do the grocery thing in here?
So They rent that boat from their horrible neighbors who, P.S., don't even know how to sail.
What is your problem, you stupid car?
You're driving me nuts.
Where were you?
Oh, Stevie, good.
Here, take this.
If it turns over, yank it out.
I waited at the library.
You should have seen her today.
I was at a light and these jerks pulled up next to mewanting to race.
I hit the gas and she just flew.
I totally blew the doors off for four seconds before she dropped an oil pan.
That's it!
Malcolm, we did it.
We won over $250 from from the good grades program at school.
Awesome.
That'll pay for this.
Isn't it beautiful?
This is for you.
I e-mailed my chess move days ago.
Stevie, I don't have to do everything with you.
Tell you what.
I'll take you for a drive.
That'll What is your problem, you stupid car?
!
You're driving me nuts!
So I'm thinking, I feel young, so why not look young?
So I got the Botox done to crow's feet and my forehead, then I had my chin done and my tummy tucked.
- And I may notstop there.
- Work it, girlfriend.
Oh, hi, Lois.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Does your grandmother know you borrowed her hands?
I went to six different stores and could not find that avocado oil you recommended.
Hal, this isn't working for me.
Well, that's because you don't scrunch and sprits like I told you to.
No, this.
Look.
Craig is flaking out on me.
I'm pulling double shifts for him and every time I come home, it's full of people.
I never have any time alone.
There is hair everywhere.
And I do not like the way you are standing lately.
Lois, these women are walking out of here with a glow.
It's wonderful.
Well, can't you at least some of the money you're making to hire a cleaning lady?
- I'm not accepting money for this !
- What?
!
I am transforming these women, Lois.
I won't soil that with money.
And it's not just the hair.
They confide in me, they need someone to listen to their problems.
You wouldn't believe what some of these women are going through.
Nancy, she's getting audited.
Margie's husband has a gambling problem, and Paula in there, she is having an affair.
What?
!
Yes, for the last five months.
It's some guy she's pretending to take golf lessons with.
Why do you keep doing this to me?
I fix your throttle leakage and your alternator dies.
I buy you a new alternator and your water pump explodes.
Every time I think I'm getting close, you find a new way to hurt me.
Hey, thanks for placing that bet today.
I tried to get out of detention, but none of the fire alarms were working.
Where's the money?
I never made the bet.
What?
I didn't make the bet.
I spent the money on something else.
A car bra!
What?
You had $200.
That horse came in at five to two.
I don't know what that is, but I'm supposed to get half of it.
Sorry, man.
But look how hot she looks.
- Malcolm, you got to calm down.
This car is messing you up.
- This car is not messing me up.
It's made me happier than I've ever been in my life.
Oh, Lois, thank God.
Fred asked me to scrub out the Dumpsters tonight, but Paula wants to work on her short iron, so I had to schedule &an emergency lesson with the golf pro.
The guy charges, like, 90 bucks an hour.
It's really eating away at my savings, but I guess I have no one to blame but myself, and, oh, my God, you know about the affair.
Damn it!
Damn it!
- You do know, right?
- Yes, I know.
Damn it!
Craig, how could you lie to me after all I've done for you?
I let you sleep on our floor when you though your cat's ghost was trying to kill you.
- I settled that feud between you and the Girl Scout troop.
- They started it.
Shut up!
I do all this and you repay me by making me drag around - That's inexcusable!
- I didn't plan this.
It just happened.
One night after inventory, we stopped in the parking lot to talk.
I bent down to pick up her keys, the next thing I know, she's got me handcuffed in a shower in a motel out by the airport.
She's crazy, Lois.
But she makes me crazy, too.
Craig I'm not kidding.
There is a dark, scary place inside of me that I didn't even know was there, but Paula knew it was there, and every night she takes me to that scary place and shows me some new, terrible, delicious corner of it.
- You're not going to rat on me, are you?
- No, but you have to end this today.
I can't, Lois.
I'm addicted.
I don't even know who I am anymore!
I know I've let you down, but I want to thank you for helping me anyway.
- Craig, I never said I - If that homeless guy is still in the Dumpster, just let him drink from the hose.
He'll leave you alone.
Stupid car.
That's four coats.
Now will you run?
!
- Malcolm, your leopard-skin seat covers are here.
- Sweet.
I can't wait to see you in them.
What's going on?
Malcolm, this is Mike.
He's from AAA.
You're in a safe place with people who care about you.
Sit down, son.
What's all this about?
Stevie and Reese have something to say and I think you should listen.
You've abandoned your friends.
You didn't even notice my new deck shoes.
- Stevie, I've just been busy, okay?
- Your car is ruining everything.
It's even affecting our illegal gambling.
I tried to pick a winner myself, but since I'm an idiot, I picked one that came in at over 600 to one.
I won $11,500 that I can't even touch because I'd have to fill out a tax form!
$11,500 that's just sitting there tormenting me because of that stupid car!
Stop calling it stupid!
That car isn't stupid.
That car is great.
It's the best thing that's ever happened to me.
- Really?
Where'd you get that shiner?
- That was my fault.
I wasn't being careful enough.
Malcolm, we're here to help, but the first step is for you to admit that you have a problem.
I did.
That's why I'm in AAA.
There's thousands of us, Malcolm, and we all know what you're going through.
I guess I didn't realizehow bad things had gotten.
I think I need to take a good long look at every Oh, yeah.
Oh, that's it.
I didn't get to read my poem.
And when Martha left the room, Tina checked the price tag on the leather coat factory outlet.
Temperature good for you?
Perfect.
As was the scalp massage.
So all you have to do is cash in the ticket for me, give me the $11,000, and you can keep $500.
- Deal.
- Thanks, man.
Well, I think it's important you have an adult you can trust.
This car is a tease.
Yesterday, she gave me the ride of my life.
Her bra flew off before I even hit the freeway.
I was so happy!
And today, she won't even start.
It's like yesterday didn't even happen.
I can't take this anymore!
Please start!
Please, I'm begging you!
Just give me a little something, please?
!
Oh, thank you so much!
I knew you'd come back.
We're meant to be together.
Don't you see?
Help!
Somebody help me!
I'm stuck!
Help!
There's a bit of a wait.
We got slammed with a wedding party and we're way behind.
Huh, The Human Volcano.
One of my favorites.
- Oh, it's so much better now that he can read minds.
- Exactly.
He used to just have heat grip.
How lame was that?
- You allergic to nuts?
- No.
All right.
What are you studying in school?
Regular stuff, I guess.
I don't really like school.
Everybody makes fun of me.
Yeah, I remember those days.
Kids can be so cruel.
The smart kids, the loners, they were the meanest.
The worst is gym class.
My own team throws the ball at me in dodgeball.
Hey, you know how you can get out of gym?
Pretend to have asthma.
All you need is a fake inhaler.
Here, take mine.
It also gets me good seats on the bus.
Don't worry.
Things are going to be better for you from here on out.
My dad tells me the same thing.
Well, your dad's a smart man.
Frank, your new haircut looks great.
Let me just get my purse and I'll drive you back home to your parents.
Craig, you know Frank's parents, Fred and Paula.
Remember, Fred is our boss at Lucky Aide?
And I believe you're giving golf lessons to his mom.
Let's go, Frank.
And I promise I'll drive very safely so we don't have an accident.
I wouldn't want to ruin your life with my carelessness.
I'm not going to make it.
Stevie was right about this car.
And so was Reese.
He was right about the car, and the horse racing.
That makes it easier.
I don't want to live in a world where Reese is right.
You really have to snap those sheets if you want to get the hair off.
- Come on.
Throw your fanny into it.
- Dad, seriously, you got to stop talking like that.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just so draining listening to all these people with their tawdry little secrets.
Like that Paula woman, Fred's wife?
Not only is she cheating on her husband, now she's two-timing on her golf instructor with her swing-dance teacher.
She is learning new moves every night if you know what I'm talking about.
She is so cold.
- Hey!
- Stevie, please, we're talking.
And Sheila's husband Randy just got a new assistant.
She's 19 years old and she doesn't even know how to type.
The girl wears a halter top to the office.
Halter tops?
Hello?
Dukes of Hazzard on line three.
They want their costumes back.
Malcolm?
Malcolm, are you all right?
What happened?
It's okay.
It's okay, son.
You'll be fine.
Just breathe deep.
Stevie you saved my life.
I treated you like dirt.
You saved my life.
Your wheel's kinda on my crotch.
Is it?
I can get off early, can't you just cancel your lesson?
I wish I could, but we're working on the Texas Two-Step tonight.
We never see each other anymore.
Lois, I see you more than I see my wife these days.
Oh, Fred, things have a way of changing for the better.
You'll see.
Attention, Lucky Aide shoppers: My name is Craig Feldspar and I have a message for Paula Lynch.
Paula, I can't go on like this.
I'm going to do the right thing, and make you my wife.
I just bought an $11,500 engagement ring which I hope you'll accept.
You're cheating on me with Craig Feldspar?
!
I think we're both victims here, Fred.
I'm going to go something that way.
Sure, it won't be easy for us, but the path of true love never did run smooth.
We'll move in with my grandmother and care for her together.
Well, they're about to tow her away.
You want to come say good-bye?
No.
I know it's tough, son.
I thought I'd never get over my first car.
'64 Plymouth Fury who couldn't keep her top on.
Then some guy stole her from me.
I saw her a few months later with a new driver and a different paint job, but, she meant nothing to me.
I had moved on.
And so will you.
Are you cutting my hair?
No.
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Oh, my God.
What?
Did you see this?
Look what Jamie wrote.
Oh, my God.
He knows his letters.
There are actual words here.
I mean, it's crude, and it's not clear what he's communicating, but Jamie is a genius.
There's my homework!
What?
I do my homework once in a while.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.10 - Billboard Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com Once every six months, Mom wakes us up at 5 a.m., shoves us into the car and makes us go to the outlet stores.
I tell you, I am never disappointed in Value Village.
No other place in the county has such a selection of irregulars.
Are these made in some country where people aren't symmetrical?
Stop complaining.
If it weren't for Value Village, most of this family would have to run around naked.
That place is all that separates us from the apes.
Oh, for crying out loud.
What?
I was not!
You look great!
The Paysons Outlet has 48-packs of paper towels for half price.
I wish we had more room in this car.
I knew we should have put the rack on top What's wrong with all of you?
We're just thinking about all those towels, honey.
I mean You're not the only one who loves a bargain.
- Come on!
- What are you doing?
Saving your minds from turning into mush.
You've been sitting on that couch watching TV for hours.
So what?
There's nothing else to do.
There's never anything to do around here.
Because you have no imaginations, because you sit in front of that idiot box all day long.
Your mother's right.
It's a sad day when three healthy boys can't think of anything to do with a beautiful Saturday.
You could take a walk, you could roll a hoop, you can start a rock collection.
There.
That's three ideas in five seconds.
I hope you're embarrassed.
You boys have no idea how lucky you are.
The day will come where you won't be able to complain about having nothing to do.
That's right.
You'll have responsibilities and a career and children.
And then you'll ask yourself, "Hey, where's my boredom now"?
All right, all right, just stop lecturing us!
God forbid those three should have to make their own fun.
I hate to admit it, but Mom challenged us to use our creativity, and I think we're better for it.
How much time do we have before the lights come on?
We've got a few minutes.
Let's give her crazy eyes, Dracula fangs, and a giant fart cloud.
Eh.
Feels done.
We went to all the trouble to get up here.
Let's really think about Reese!
What are you writing?
"I want Reese".
Come on.
You know she's thinking it.
How are we supposed to get away with this if you put your name up there?
Relax.
We're miles from our house.
Nobody here knows us.
Oh, my God!
Did you hear something?
What are you boys doing up there?
It's Mom!
How'd she know where to find us?
I told you she's got tracking devices in our feelings!
If you two geniuses had ripped them out like I did, we wouldn't be in this mess!
- Maybe she didn't see us.
- Reese, Malcolm, Dewey!
You get down here this instant!
Missus, I don't know who you are thinking we are.
Your boys are very different boys than we are being.
Oh, no!
Where's the back door on this thing?
It's a billboard!
We are so dead!
This time she'll finish us!
What are we gonna do?
!
Oh, God!
Oh, God!
Why do billboards have to be so visible?
Come down now!
Reese, give me your pocket knife.
Okay But if you miss her, you'll only make her madder.
What are you doing?
Hold on.
I know that look.
He's using his brain.
We can't come down because we are protesting this offensive depiction of women!
What?
!
What?
!
We've come up here to make a difference in the world!
Yeah!
To speak for women like this one who can't speak for themselves!
Yeah, because they're billboards!
Shut up.
We're not coming down until women everywhere get the respect they deserve!
No matter how long it takes, we're staying up here!
Oh, for the love of God.
I don't know who you think you're fooling.
- It's about time!
- Thank you, boys!
- God bless you!
Oh, no.
She's talking to the cops.
Wait, that's good.
If she gets ahold of us, she'll have to beat us within the law.
All these people showing up is making her madder and madder.
Why didn't we just climb down right away?
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
I panicked.
I want to know what you're going to do to get my boys down.
It's a complicated situation, ma'am.
We have very specific guidelines for how to deal with political protesters.
They're not political protesters.
Those boys don't give a damn about women's rights!
If they did, they'd clean up their rooms once in a while!
This is hooliganism!
Sorry it took me so long.
Eight different baby-sitters turned me down.
Do you know Jamie's on a website?
Where are the boys?
I told you.
Oh, good God!
I thought it was a metaphor.
I'm sure you have ladders.
I'm sure you have people who climb them.
So get one of them up there and get my children down!
Ma'am, let me explain something about the Police Commissioner.
This is an election year.
We've had a lot of unflattering video on the news lately.
The Chang case, the Jefferson case, the Rodriguez case.
All he has left is the white vote.
So he's not going to let a bunch of video cameras tape us manhandling those children.
But if there's anything else that we can do for you Yeah, how about you call a cop?
Sorry, Officer.
It's not you, it's me.
I have a severe gambling problem.
Lost the house playing Pai-Gow.
She's a saint.
Would you excuse us a moment?
Honey, calm down.
You know what pepper spray feels like.
Let's just give it an hour or two.
When these people lose interest and the crowd disperses, we'll get the boys down.
That's right, Steven.
I'm here at the scene of this dramatic demonstration In an age of cynicism when it's said that young people don't care about the important issues These three youngsters seem to have struck a nerve among like-minded citizens who've had enough of this degrading depiction of women.
Lois, did you see all the news vans?
Lyle at Seven told me to get out of his shot.
He is one handsome man.
Over here we have the proud mother of these three young protesters.
What do you want the nation to know about your boys?
No comment.
So you must be the father?
Can we get some comment from you?
I, I don't know that I really want to sound off.
How do you account for your sons' extraordinary sensitivity to women's issues?
Well, Dinah, in our house we emphasize the rights of all people.
I've tried to pass along what I like to call "core values".
Equality, respect, compassion, nutrition.
We have something called the Clean Plate Club.
What's that cop doing?
I think he's throwing something.
Oh my God!
What is it?
It's a cell phone.
Hello.
Hello.
Mom?
Before you say anything, I want you to listen carefully.
There are a couple ways we can handle this.
If you come down right now, I can go as low as three weeks in your room.
If there's no you get two meals a day and enough light to read by.
You should think about this very carefully, but you've only got ten minutes until this offer expires.
Then all bets are off.
Oh, my God.
I know.
She's negotiating.
She's never negotiated anything before.
We found a weakness.
All these people and the TV cameras.
She must be scared.
I didn't think this was possible.
Suddenly, she looks so small.
People, the battle before us may be long, but we will not stop until we end the oppression!
Women of the world Unite!
I am their mother, and I say this has gone on long enough!
Don't you have snipers with tranquilizer guns or a giant net?
!
- What do I pay taxes for?
- No, the life of a crusader is not an easy one, but once that fire is lit, there is no putting it out.
Feminism must be very important &to your boys.
Meryl, please!
They're not my "boys".
They're my children.
If you feel the need to label them, I'm sorry for you.
It's high time we showed a national audience This is national?
that we're still producing heroes in this country, and three of them are up there!
It's your sons, ma'am.
Well, you're cutting it awfully close.
I gave you ten minutes, and you've taken nearly nine and a half.
We decided we're not coming down.
What?
!
We discussed it as a family.
See, we figure you're as mad now as you possibly can ever get.
We've reached the point where nothing we do can make it any worse.
So every hour we stay up here is another hour of freedom.
Plus another 30 or 40 supporters added to our fan base.
Malcolm, let's set aside the fact that you know you've done wrong.
Let's ignore that you're pretending to have principles you don't have just to get out of it.
You have to come down sometime.
And life is long.
That's what's nice about being young.
We really don't think that far ahead.
This whole thing's been kind of eye-opening.
If nothing else, we've all had a lesson on the ephemeral nature of power.
Power's a funny thing.
It's when you think you have it that you're in trouble.
Valid point.
Historically.
But on a philosophical level, Mom we've already won.
We're free.
And no matter what happens tonight, we both know it.
I think it's getting cold up here.
I don't think we should do this anymore.
I don't know who we think we're kidding.
- We're not going to be able to win this - Dewey, don't look into her eyes!
Huh?
What just happened?
Damn it.
I remember my mother, smart as any man, down on her knees in the kitchen, scrubbing that floor 'til it shined.
- I think I was seven when I made a promise to myself and to all women - Hal?
Yes.
Oh, my God.
I saw you on TV tonight, and I couldn't believe it was you, but you kept talking and talking and talking.
And I realized it had to be you.
Wendy - How long's it been?
- 23 years, Hal.
You know, I remember the last time I saw you down to the day and the minute.
I can tell you exactly where I was standing Wendy!
That was so long ago.
I've got a whole new life now.
- You can't just come here and expect - Promises were made, Hal.
And now that I found you, I'm not just gonna go away.
Look, I know that there are some issues that probably need resolving Listen, honey, let's get a cup of coffee way over there.
No.
I have an idea.
Is this going up to the boys?
Yes, it's some baked goods, some jackets for when it gets cold and my phone number.
Oh, this is wonderful.
You certainly went to a lot of trouble.
My boys are just going to be so appreciative of your kindness.
I think the Green Valley Women's Collective makes better banana bread than the Feminists for Change.
According to the wrapper, we're the first male hands to touch this.
You know, except for Mom and Dad and Francis and Jamie, I think this has really brought our family together.
What are you doing?
What?
You know what.
Why do you get the one with the cherry?
I just grabbed one.
I don't care.
If you don't care, then let me have it.
I already took it.
Hey, I'm here, too.
I want the cherry.
You always do this.
You only want it because I have it.
I don't care what you have.
Reese, you're not the center of everything Wait.
Why would they only put a cherry on one cupcake?
This is Mom.
There may be those who will try to drive a wedge between us.
But if we learn nothing else tonight, we will learn to stand together!
Damn it.
We have a pretty sweet deal up here.
Food, drinks.
Everyone of our needs is being taken care of.
Everyone.
Man, they better stop sending up bran muffins.
Hey!
You may want to burn this basket!
How are the books they gave us?
The feminist joke book's a little ham-fisted, but these fairy tales are interesting.
In this one, Cinderella tells the Prince he's sapping her woman-strength, and she pushes him aside to create a matriarchy with fluid gender roles.
Can you believe these cows actually think we're on their side ?
We love you, boys!
Right on, sister!
Check out that pig.
You don't have to talk about them like that.
They've been really nice to us.
Yeah, and they really believe in this stuff.
That is such a load.
Every woman down there is just here because they're jealous.
Of what?
Of the fact that they're not hot enough to be strippers.
They act like they're all offended, but really they're just mad about their own giant butts.
Believe me, in their heart of hearts, every woman wants to be her.
- What about Mom?
- We're not talking about moms.
We're talking about women.
So all women want to be strippers?
There are no women in the world who want to be doctors or lawyers or anything like that?
Cut the act, Malcolm.
They can't hear you.
Just because they look like dogs doesn't mean they hear like dogs.
I'm sleeping on the other side.
Come on, I was just being honest!
So whipped.
Where are the heroes who fight for a cause?
Who live by the code of their own moral laws?
Who stand up to tyrants and fight the police?
Like Gandhi and Martin and Bobby and Rosa And Malcolm and Dewey and Reese?
And Malcolm and Dewey and Reese.
Reese?
Reese.
Hi.
I've been wanting to talk to you.
Really?
Yeah, sugar.
I had to wait for your brothers to go to sleep.
You don't want to share me, do you?
Everyone's mad at me.
Malcolm and Dewey think I'm a jerk.
You're not a jerk.
You're just little.
I think you're cute as a bug.
Do you want me to kiss you?
Uh yes, ma'am.
Wow.
Damn tootin' wow.
So, will you take off your giant top?
Do you have a giant dollar?
I'll get a whole bunch if you'll come back again.
I'll come back every night if you want.
You're so great.
The girls at school won't even talk to me.
Listen, if they're not willing to talk to you or dance on a pole, they're not really your friends.
You don't need them.
You have me.
I'm perfect.
I'm the only woman in the world for you, Reese.
You are?
Of course.
I'm 60 feet tall.
My skin is five inches thick.
No matter how creepy and insensitive and thoughtless you are, you can't hurt me.
That's all I ever wanted.
Why aren't all women like you?
Well, I'm not real, sugar.
Oh, yeah.
You just dreamed me up as a super-sexy way to face the fact that you're going to live the rest of your life alone.
But that's not for sure, is it?
And you know the saddest part?
You're gonna wake up before you can think of anything really good to do with me.
Wait.
We can't just give up on this.
Wait.
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me!
Right now the mother of the protesters is with the Police Commissioner, pleading for her brave boys whose sacrifice continues to inspire so many.
Those boys are like dogs.
I have to get them on their backs just to reestablish my dominance.
Look, this whole protest thing is a lie anyway.
They don't believe a word of it.
If it's an issue of liability, I'll sign any waiver.
Just get them down here!
Do I appear to look concerned?
What?
Yeah, sure, you look concerned.
Oh, thank God.
My handlers say that I don't pull it off.
Can't do the mouth.
I want those boys down.
Believe me, there is nothing I would like more than to tear 'em down and crack a few heads.
But in an election year we all have to make sacrifices.
You know, this whole thing brings me back to my days on the Freedom Ride.
It's fantastic.
We're getting an injunction.
What?
The ACLU found a judge who's completely sympathetic to what your boys are doing.
In two hours, we'll have an airtight court order and your boys can stay up there for days, even weeks.
Excuse me, I have something to say.
I want the world to know how proud I am of my boys for making this statement, despite the wind and the cold and little Dewey's medical condition.
And I want to thank the Police Commissioner for letting my son stay up there, even if it means rolling the dice on a diabetic coma.
It's nice to see someone who cares about principles more than they care about the life of a little boy.
Get 'em down.
Malcolm!
Reese!
Oh, my God!
We'll have you in your mother's arms in a minute, little Dewey!
No!
Excuse me, are you Hal's wife?
Yeah, this is, uh There's something you need to know about your husband.
We both worked at the Tiger Shop at Macy's.
One night he got me drunk and borrowed $400 from me!
What?
He bought a velour suit and faked his own death to get out of paying me back.
He actually blew up a phone booth.
I figure with interest it comes to about ten grand.
I'm sorry, but Hey!
Hey, everybody!
You can take us down, but first I have something to say.
I realized something up here.
This woman is beautiful, she's sexy, and perfect and gigantic, but you know what?
She isn't real.
If she was real, she'd be different.
I know that if I was real, I'd want people to listen to me.
I'd want people to care about what I think and not ignore me.
I guess what these protesters are trying to say is, that women, real women, aren't that different from regular people.
They want the same things that men want.
Only men don't have to hold a big protest to get them.
And women shouldn't have to either.
Well, I'm very proud of you boys.
Let's go home where I can truly express how I'm feeling.
I've had six hours to figure out all the horrible things that are going to happen to you.
You, I still have to think about.
Get him to Deaconess Diabetic Center right away.
Dad!
Tell them what's going on!
- Tell them I'm not - He's fading!
Let's go!
Let's go!
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Hal, did you baby-proof the kitchen like I asked you to?
I'm doing it right now.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.11 - Dewey's Opera Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com This is so boring.
It's your fault for inviting Stevie over.
He can't do anything, so we can't do anything, and it's always boring and lame.
Reese, he's not deaf.
I have my fun.
This is exactly what I'm talking about.
This would be fun if I were looking at it.
When you read it, it's not fun; it's sad.
Now I'm bored and sad.
Thanks a lot, Stevie!
Reese!
No, it's horrible.
I think it sucks that he always gets his face rubbed in the fact that he will never get to enjoy anything.
Maybe he'd be happier if they stuck you in some kind of special tank.
Whoa, check this out!
What?
Street-luging!
Look at those pictures!
"Police call it the most reckless, dangerous teen craze in years".
It says they look back with fondness on the crack epidemic.
We could totally build a board like that!
Except we wouldn't.
Because our parents wouldn't allow it.
So, since we're not doing it, no one has to say anything.
Yes, this sport seems immature, and frankly, I just think it's uncool.
Hey, Stevie, look, Pentominos.
Why were we bored?
So, you just bought a new bed, just like that.
Hal, we had that smelly, saggy old one for 20 years.
It's time for a new one.
This one is certainly bigger.
Yeah.
It's king-sized.
They're a little bigger.
So you'll be further away.
I guess.
Maybe a couple inches.
So, is that the reason?
You want there to be more distance between us?
Hal, I didn't really think about the size.
It was on sale at Mattress King.
I guess you couldn't pass up a deal like that, huh?
It's just interesting to learn how it starts.
How what starts?
Well, first you buy the king-size bed, the largest bed made.
But then of course, at some point, even the giant bed doesn't put enough distance between you and the hideous monster.
So you start sleeping in another room.
Then soon, we're barely exchanging pleasantries, and then one day you say, "Hal, let's just say what we're both thinking".
And then, I end up eating alone on a Formica table under a swinging lightbulb while you, are on a beach in Ibiza being rubbed with cocoa butter by your new lover who you can never get too close to!
Hal, it's a bed!
The old one was horrible.
This one is nice.
Look, I know this is a big change for you.
So I'm just going to have to think of some way to make you very, very happy in this bed.
Good luck!
I'm here to snitch.
Reese and Malcolm are in the garage.
They won't let me in, but they're building something.
If you want help in the penalty phase, let me know.
Dewey, I am not going to go in there and have a big fight with the boys because you've got nothing to do.
We have a rule in this family about what we do when we're bored.
I don't care if they are your skateboard wheels.
We're not putting a "No Fat Chicks" sticker on it.
All right, but it's still our policy.
What're you crying about?
I was just sitting there and this, this opera came on.
People screaming and hating.
It was our family, but with music!
And they all mixed together in a counterpoint that underscored the futility of their lives!
And the stretto showed the minor key had been hiding in the subdominant from the very first bar.
All I understood was, "Hit me, Reese.
Hit me and never stop hitting me".
Yeah, well, that was the gist of it.
The animals in the farm include, but are not limited to, the cow, the horse, the pig, the chicken, the sheep.
Dewey, the algebra homework you gave us, did you want us to show our work?
Huh?
I dunno.
Just a sec.
the alpaca, You okay?
You want to wrap your hands in tinfoil?
I have nothing!
I want to write an opera.
I know I can do it.
I have all the music.
I can hear it in my head.
I just don't have a story to hang it on.
It has to be something so dramatic it's like a knife in the heart.
the peccary, the hog bear, That's the trouble with being a kid.
I want a dog.
I don't have a dog.
But ultimately, so what?
The sounds produced by said animals are, respectively: moo, neigh, oink, cluck, gobble, silent.
I don't see anyone.
Are you sure this is the right place?
I don't know.
It was a pretty reputable extreme sport chat room.
Hey!
Is it cool if we ride with you?
All right!
This is gonna be fun!
Nope.
That's not gonna happen.
Too steep, too dangerous.
I might die.
Call me a girl.
I don't care.
You know what?
I'm gonna try it.
Are you serious, dude?
It's too steep.
Your face will be like an inch from the asphalt.
No, I'm pretty sure I can do this.
Malcolm, seriously.
Think about this.
I don't want you killed or brain-damaged.
You're my brother and Hey, this isn't bad.
I'm actually having fun.
Wow.
I think I'm gonna turn out to be a really good luger.
The whole unpopular thing will be just a funny story about my days pre-luge.
I bet I'll get my own line of clothing.
Maybe a girlfriend.
Maybe two.
They'd fight over me, but I'd make them work it out.
Someone owes me an extreme apology!
Hey!
Hey, you!
Jerk!
You totally made me crash!
Just because you can blow a lot of money on some high-end luge doesn't mean you're not a jerk!
You're just a rich jerk.
Jerk!
A ha!
Hal!
Oh, what a blind fool I've been!
To think, when you said you didn't buy this bed to get away from me, I believed you!
Oh, Hal, calm down!
It's just that when you sleep you're so hot, you radiate heat.
You're like a giant radiator!
And when I sleep, I need to flop my arms around and I can't do that if you're on top of me!
How long have you found me hideous?
For God's sakes, this is why I have to lie to you all the time!
Did you ever love me?
Who are you?
Fair warning, Hal.
If you wake that baby up, he is yours for the night!
A sale at Mattress King?
!
Oh You must have laughed at me for swallowing that one!
They don't know the meaning of the word "sale" over there.
Their everyday prices are guaranteed rock-bottom!
You're just working yourself up to get your own way.
You always do that, Hal.
What should I do when I know that you looked me in the face And.
You lied?
Don't be hysterical.
You always get hysterical.
It's called having feelings.
You should know.
You're an expert at faking them!
At least mine are real!
Hal, don't make a thing out of this!
What should a man do, when he knows that he'll never be happy again?
Sing a song?
Just get a grip, Hal, don't overreact.
Overreact?
I feel horrible, I feel lousy!
I'm having a stroke, seriously, Lois.
It feels just like one.
We think it's one, too!
We're sure it's one, too!
It's a panic attack, Like that time in the laundromat, Breathe into a pillow!
Good idea.
A pillow?
!
How cruel!
How callous!
Poor Hal!
This stroke is the worst case of emotional blackmail, she's ever seen!
And I've seen plenty!
Call 911!
Tell them a blood vessel just burst in my brain, Just halfway between my neck and my nose.
That's only if you care!
If not, feel free To sit by while I die, and watch Leno !
Blackmail!
Stroke!
Blackmail!
Stroke!
What a big baby!
What a giant stroke!
I'm not stopping till I take that guy down.
How much skin is left on your chest?
Enough.
You wanted to see me.
Stevie, brace yourself.
I'm going to tell you a really big secret about something so huge that every bone in your body is going to want to tell, but you have to promise not to.
This is an actual street luge.
Like from your magazine.
Heaven forfend.
I need you to help me with some calculations of wheel friction and frame stiffness to get this thing perfect.
I have to beat this rich jerk who keeps making me wipe out.
I'm going to make a bet with him, and race him.
You think you can beat this glorious alpha male?
It's going to happen.
'Cause I'm going to hide in the bushes and jump out at him and force him to crash.
It may not be the most honest thing in the world, but you know what, who cares?
This guys totally deserves it.
I'd hate to be him.
Hal, get in this bed and go to sleep!
Oh, I'll sleep, Lois.
I'll sleep where I'm wanted!
Are you coming back to bed, or should I just order a crib for you?
I'm not coming back.
I don't like to be where I'm not wanted.
Especially if it's on a big giant bed!
You've been on the couch for four days.
I can hold on as long as you can.
I have nothing to apologize for!
Why would you?
I bet they were the best four days of your life No!
No!
No!
You're both holding back too much.
Glacienda, you sacrificed your future for a family that's not even grateful.
You've got all this anger bubbling up that's ready to explode!
And Don Argento, you have nothing in the world but that woman.
You hate your job, you don't have friends and now you're losing her!
Dewey.
When it says "Jamie wets his diaper," should I really wet myself?
No.
But on show night?
If the second act drags.
Dewey, the problem is that these characters are just treading water.
I mean, it's been four days and we've done four scenes with him on the couch.
You're right.
They're just stuck.
What if Don Argento solves his romantic problems with a machete in a tragic, yet comedic, big bloody mess?
Yes, I want to return a mattress I bought last week in accord with your 30-day return policy.
Okay, I'll speak with the king.
You're returning the bed?
That's it?
In what world is that an ending?
Your father and I were arguing.
It's just not worth it.
That doesn't seem like a very satisfying resolution.
Well, sometimes marriage is about getting by.
You're not always satisfied with everything.
Wow.
I can't believe Dad was so right.
He said if he made a big enough stink, he'd get his way.
Well, it's a good lesson for me, though.
Thanks, Mom.
Okay.
80 bucks.
Street rules.
Which means no rules.
And don't let yourself think about what might happen, because you don't want to get psyched out.
And don't think about getting psyched out because you might get psyched out.
People who get psyched out make mistakes.
Good advice.
What?
Go!
Oh, my God, Stevie, no!
All right, Hal, I didn't want to have to say this, but you've pushed me to it.
What?
There's a reason I bought a bed that was bigger.
I did want some distance from you, but it's not because I don't love you and I don't want to be close to you.
I don't understand.
There are certain things that have to happen with my body at the end of the day.
Certain events that have to transpire.
And if they don't transpire, I end up with stomach cramps, and I don't want it to happen two inches away from your nose.
That's your secret?
I know it's stupid and embarrassing and I want to be sexy for you, but after 20 years, I just have to have a break from clamping down and gritting my teeth all night.
Oh, honey, I don't care about that.
And it's not a secret.
The second you fall asleep you let loose like a sailor.
What?
Oh, yeah, it's like when they put the balloons away after the Thanksgiving parade.
Oh, my God.
I can't hear anything.
You're tunneling out.
Honey, honey, relax.
Honey, we're married.
It doesn't matter how embarrassing something is.
Because no one knows it but me.
Lois Don't be embarrassed.
I know Everything about you.
I know when you, think you're alone.
You have to check, if your ears have grown.
Every day, before you go to work.
You know how I panic, When I see a monkey.
I've seen you take pizza, From the garbage and eat it!
I know all of you, You know all of me.
But it's only us, my love !
No one else knows.
No one else.
No one else.
No one Else.
I'll return the bed.
Honey, you've fallen asleep for a week in that bed.
They're not gonna take it back.
There you are.
I was looking all over for you.
Boy, I wish I was you.
The worst thing in your life is taking a nap.
You still owe me 80 bucks.
Take it out of my pocket.
Ladies and gentlemen.
We now present a story of shame, humiliation and the deep personal secrets, that lurk within "The Marriage Bed".
Wow, everyone we know is here.
I hope Dewey doesn't embarrass himself.
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Wow, I remember this: this is Reese's fifth birthday.
This must be Christmas the same year.
He grew up so fast.
He sure did.
Here's Malcolm's first day at school.
Oh Remember when we lost Dewey at the flea market.
Still keeps great time.
You want to go through the arrest reports?
I'll pour some more wine.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.12 - Living Will Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com Hal, do you want Raisin Bran or oatmeal?
Oatmeal.
No, wait Raisin Bran.
No, no oatmeal.
Oh, but Raisin Bran's got that crunch.
And those raisins.
But sometimes you get too many raisins.
You don't have that problem with oatmeal.
Oh, but oatmeal can be lumpy.
But sometimes good lumpy.
But, not usually.
So definitely it's going to be Raisin Bran no, eggs!
You're having Raisin Bran.
Oh, God, thank you.
Hal, I don't know why you have such a hard time making decisions.
Hal, sweetie.
You have to decide.
For your birthday, do you want a petting zoo or a clown?
Both?
Who knows?
Probably no reason.
You might as well ask me why I'm afraid of clowns and snakes.
Good morning, everybody.
Hey, Craig.
Thanks for offering me a ride to work today.
That's nice of you.
My pleasure.
Hey, gee whiz, you know who I haven't seen in the longest time?
Your boys.
I think I'll just drop in and say an innocent hello.
Hey, boys, what do you say the four of us have a giant tickle party?
!
Okay, that was just a cover I didn't want to alarm your parents.
What's going on?
I need you guys to teach me how to fight.
There's this jerk who's always picking on me, and I'm sick of it.
Why are you asking us?
Because this guy's stronger and faster than me.
The only chance I've got is if I fight dirty.
And let's face it, your family is legendary for that.
Well, people exaggerate Please, you've got to teach me everything you know.
I don't think that's such a great idea.
I mean, I teach you some tricks, you teach them to someone else, he teaches them to another guy and sooner or later, I'm in a fair fight.
Sorry, Craig.
What am I supposed to do?
I came to you guys asking for help because that's what I thought friends do for their friends.
- Dude, calm down.
- I though xxx to each other.
I mean, after all these years, after everything I've done for you - Craig, stop it.
- I can't help it.
Okay.
I guess we can teach you a few move.
Just stop crying.
Really?
I mean, you're not just saying that?
You'll teach me how to fight dirty?
Yes.
But you're gonna have to fully commit to this.
And you need to know that once you start training with us, you're gonna see the world differently.
And there's nothing we can ever do to restore your innocence.
Thank you so much.
You guys are the best.
You hug me, and the lesson starts right now.
Hi.
I'm Peter Rubin from Bernstein, Wyatt and McCormick.
Are you Hal?
Look, I'll tell you what I tell all the other lawyers.
Look around.
This skeleton has been picked clean.
But go ahead, sue away.
Actually, that's not why I'm here.
I'll leave you a copy of the will to go through on your own, but the bottom line is that Mr. Edelman has given you power of attorney.
The family on the corner with the boat on the lawn?
I barely even knew the man.
Why would he give me power of attorney?
Well, there are some difficult family issues involved, and he wanted someone impartial.
Apparently, he considers everyone else in the neighborhood a friend.
So I'm the one that has to decide how all his stuff gets divided?
What?
No.
Oh, thank God.
No, he's not dead.
He's in a coma on life support.
You have to decide whether or not to pull the plug.
A man's life is in my hands.
This isn't paper or plastic.
This is life or death.
There's nothing more life or death than life or death.
Hal, calm down.
Panicking isn't going to help.
You know, this is all your fault.
What?
!
I am completely unprepared for this.
I've had no practice.
I haven't made a decision around here in years.
When exactly did it get to the point where you make all the decisions in our marriage?
When you said, "Lois, I want you to make all the decisions in our marriage".
Well, you didn't have to listen to me.
Oh, I got all this stuff racing through my mind.
I, I can't eat, I can't sleep Oh, Hal, if you want, I'll make the decision for you.
No.
I was given this responsibility.
A man entrusted his fate in my hands.
I can't just shrug that off.
I can do this.
I just need to focus my mind on the problem and think clearly.
Yes.
I've got it!
Lois, I have made the decision.
Want to guess what it is?
Hal.
Oh, all right.
I'll keep trying.
Craig, I'd like to welcome you to the first day of your new, more vicious life.
I give you the human body.
For clarity, we've divided it into the three major theaters of operation.
The head.
The torso.
And what are those?
You know what those are.
Now the first thing you need to know is that this is all about pride.
Do you have pride, Craig?
Yes.
Okay, that is not the answer I was looking for.
You show me a man with pride, and I'll show you a man with limited options.
Let's say that this is your opponent, and he's coming after you.
Hey, man, we can work this out.
I didn't know she was your girl.
See?
Now he's blind, and you have the time to really get creative.
Personally, I like to leave at least one sense intact so he knows what's happening to him.
I knew I came to the right place.
Okay, Dewey, you're up.
Okay, first, I'm going to need you to take off your glasses.
Ow!
My eyes!
I didn't know we were starting!
There is no starting in dirty fighting.
Life is one big fight from the day you're born to the day you die.
Okay.
Maybe we should slow down a little.
Ow!
Time out!
Time out!
I think we're wasting our time here.
Let's just kick him in the kidneys and call it a night.
No!
Please!
I know I suck, but I want to be better.
Please.
I'll try harder, I promise.
Let me try something.
All right, Craig, listen.
I want you to think.
I want you to visualize every bully that ever picked on you or beat you up.
Really see the look of contempt on their faces as they pounded on you.
- You got it?
- Mm-hmm.
Now, picture what they were looking at.
Oh.
It's disgusting!
Is he going for the plums?
It appears so.
Well, he sure won't have to worry about the guy's children coming after him.
Look at him.
He can't even move, and still you can see how much he's suffering.
Lying there, enduring the pain, hour after endless hour.
You can see in his face he's just begging to be put out of his misery.
- It's awful.
- Oh God, yes.
Look at him.
Look how hard he's fighting.
Those clenched hands, the set of his jaw.
It's inspiring to see such a fierce will to live.
He really wants to make it.
It's beautiful.
He's really gonna Here's extra pudding if Okay, it was a good plan having the guy meet you here.
We've set up a few things to give you a little edge if you get in trouble.
There's a broken bottle in that pile of leaves, and a can of bug spray under the Big Wheel.
- If it runs out, it still makesa great blunt object.
-Remember, we're here for you.
Unless it looks like you're getting a total beating.
Then I may have to take his side.
Don't worry.
I hate this guy more than anyone on Earth.
This jerk is going to finally get what he deserves.
Craigy?
Is that you back there?
Hello, Dad.
For God's sake, son, you have no upper body strength at all.
I know girls that could get out of this hold.
Get your foot off my neck so I can kill you.
Craigy, do you have any idea how pathetic you look right now?
Do you even care?
Are you so wrapped up with being a useless piece of pudgethat you can't even see how embarrassed you're making me?
Um, I think he needs to breathe.
I'm going to let you up now.
I want you to dust yourself off, suck in your gut, and introduce me to your friends.
I'm not doing anything you tell me.
I hate you.
And I wasn't even choking.
I was faking it.
Vic Feldspar.
Nice to meet you, boys.
- I'm this one's father, I guess.
- Father?
Ha!
You pretended not to know me at the father-son picnic.
Sorry I wasn't swelling with pride while I watched you suck the butter off other people's corncobs.
You wonder why I'm so messed up?
It's because from the day I was born, I've heard nothing but four-count Burpees and constant, lisping criticism.
Why don't you go back to San Diego and all your macho friends?
I'm not leaving until you seriously think about my offer.
I don't want your stupid gymnasiums.
I told you.
Craigy, the people in Chicago put in a very nice bid.
I can't put them off anymore.
This is your last chance.
He wants to give you a string of gymnasiums?
As long as he can get me back under his thumb.
Actually, I'm giving them up either way.
It's time for me to retire.
I got a top of the line Fleetwood RV.
I'm going to drag it across America with my teeth.
Son, don't be an idiot.
There is still a chance I can fix you.
I don't care.
I'm not going back with you.
- I escaped, and I'm staying escaped.
- Okay, you're obviously hysterical.
I've got to start my 30-mile run.
That gives you two hours and 16 minutes to calm down.
Meet me at Applebee's, and we'll try to discuss this like grown-ups.
I'll come, but it'll be for the great service and atmosphere, not for you!
- Dad, what are you doing?
- I am making a decision tree.
It is a tool to help you make difficult decisions.
First, I started out with two branches, one for pulling the plug, the other one for keeping him alive.
Then I made branches from those branches for all the possible outcomes.
I'm getting it all out of my head so I can see what I'm dealing with logically.
"Pulling plug causes feeling of Godlike power.
Forced to kill again"?
Well, I'm trying to cover everything.
But now I have gone through all the possibilities, and I really think I am zeroing in on a decision.
All your outcomes on "pull the plug" assume that he dies right away.
Yes, Dewey, that's what pulling the plug means.
Not necessarily.
He could continue to live without his respirator, his body wasting away while he struggles for breath like a fish on a dock gasping for air, slowly suffocating over the course of weeks or even months.
- I read about this one - Thank you, Dewey.
Like I don't get enough of the know-it-all stuff from Malcolm.
Here you go, Craig.
I made your favorite; lemon meringue pie.
I want to thank you people for your hospitality.
Opening your house up to me and the living garbage disposal over here.
It's our pleasure.
I hope you like dinner.
I wasn't sure whether to make a chicken or a ham.
Chicken or ham, boy, that's a tough one.
Chicken or ham.
You're life must be a living hell.
So, did Craig tell you how he got honorable mention for his community gardens?
Sitting on his ass making food?
Sounds about right.
Hello.
Oh, yes, Dr. Samson.
Hal, you promised us a decision a week ago.
The hospital needs this room for urgent care patients.
Now, we have to either pull the plug on Mr. Edelman or move him to a private intensive care facility.
- We have to have your decision now, right now.
- Okay, listen, I'm going to need your help here.
Just strictly from an emotionless, purely medical standpoint, what should I do?
- Pull the plug.
- Let him live.
Damn it, Georgie, you know the chances for a coma patient waking up are practically zero.
Practically zero does not mean zero.
Why the hell do you give up so easily?
He's shown no activity, no responsiveness, no eye movement for a month.
It's over.
You know as well as I that patients can be in a persistent vegetative state for years and still recover.
We can argue about this all day.
We're not going to get anywhere.
It's up to you.
Just put an "X" somewhere.
What's wrong with him?
The doctors called it "hysterical conversion disorder".
It's psychosomatic.
Apparently, he's paralyzed from the waist up.
Waist up?
Dad, what is it?
I think he's thanking you.
Dad, what are you doing here?
I told you no at Applebee's, no at Malcolm's house, and no all the way home as you jogged alongside my car.
I wanted to give you something.
What is it?
Used to call that your unk-unk.
Your mother bought that for you the day she found out she was pregnant.
The only day I saw her happier was the day you were born.
Wow.
I haven't been totally honest with you, son, but before I go, I owe you the truth.
I never made it a secret how disappointed I am with the way you turned out.
But what you don't know is if your mother was alive today, she's be just as disappointed.
What?
Opening those gyms wasn't just my dream, it was your mother's dream, too.
Fitness was her life, and it was her dying wish for you to embrace a life of health and vitality.
- Why didn't you ever tell me that?
- Because I kept thinking if I pushed you enough, eventually you'd turn yourself around.
But, apparently to you, I'm an annoyance, not an inspiration.
- No, you're - It doesn't really matter.
Your mom's in heaven now, crying at the waste you made of your life.
I know you don't want to run those gyms to please me, but you might want to consider doing it for your mother.
Do those jumpsuits come in extra large?
I waited all my life to hear those words.
It's been four days, Hal.
I've tried to be patient, but this has gone on long enough.
You've got to snap out of it.
Look, I'll admit you've been resourceful.
You've learned to do so many things, and the sex has been interesting, but you can't go on living like this.
Don't think I don't know what this is all about, Hal.
You're trying to avoid making this decision.
This is not going to work.
And frankly, this whole thing is beneath you.
It's a cowards way out, Hal.
You think I wouldn't like a paralyzed vacation, everyone waiting on me hand and foot?
But you know what?
It doesn't work that way.
You can't make up ridiculous illnesses just to get out of doing what you don't want to do.
Oh, for God's sake, do you have any idea how insane you're acting?
I'm just glad that your boys aren't here to see this.
Oh, Hal, you changed Jamie's diapers with those feet.
- Reese, how could you just leave him in there?
- Every time I pulled him out, Jamie started crying.
Okay, this is ending right now.
You are going to stop being paralyzed and you are going to make this decision.
I know you think you can't do this.
I know you're worried you'll choose wrong, but Hal, you had a very hard choice to make in your life before and you made not only a good decision.
You made a brilliant one you decided to marry me.
No one thought it was a good idea.
All your friends thought you were making a horrible mistake.
Your parents, my parents.
They all said I was a pushy, opinionated loudmouth, but you knew I was perfect for you.
And I am.
It's the best decision anyone's ever made.
Every day I wake up grateful or that brilliant, brilliant decision.
And you can do it again, Hal.
I know you can.
But with you it was obvious.
Even so, honey.
You better say your good-byes quickly.
We need to squeeze in a lake swim before we head to the airport.
- But - Ready?
Begin.
I'll miss you guys.
Craig, you don't have to do this.
Let's face it.
I don't have any better options.
It's your lunchtime.
That's his lunch?
Every day until he drops 90 pounds.
These pills here are my own formula.
It's got three times the RDA of the all you basic vitamins and nutrients.
Sadly, it doesn't contain any character.
See ya, Craig.
I guess this means I don't owe you that 50 bucks anymore.
I'll think of you every time I open a jar of mayonnaise.
So, um, Vic, Craig's mom was a real fitness buff, huh?
Absolutely.
She did a triathlon the day after giving birth to Craig.
There was no stopping that woman.
Really?
No stopping this woman?
!
Give that back!
Mama?
Oh, my God, she's beautiful.
I thought you said all the photos of her were destroyed in the twister that killed her.
What did you want me to say?
That your mother ran out on me with a guy who owned a pie shop?
That after years of slaving away to give that woman everything, she decided she wasn't attracted to me anymore?
That I wasn't man enough for her?
Come on, Craig.
What would that have done to your self-esteem?
- So, my mom is alive?
-Oh, great.
So, now this all going to be about her.
How could you do this to me?
How could you lie to me all these years?
I did what I thought was best for you.
No, you didn't.
You did what you thought would punish her.
All this time, you weren't yelling at me, but at this beautiful, beautiful woman.
Dad, I'm not going with you.
My life isn't a mess.
I love my life.
I love my job, I love my cat, I love my friends.
I've made something of myself.
I'm Desk Sergeant at my Neighborhood Watch.
And a 14th-level elf cleric.
I am not going to throw that away.
You almost sounded like a man for a second.
Good-bye, Dad.
You actually have a pretty good grip there, son.
It's my joystick hand.
Hal, I am so proud of you for making such a great decision.
And such a surprising one.
I thought your only choices were life or death.
Who would have thought there was a third option?
People aren't willing to think outside the box.
See, the answer was there all the time.
Someone just had to see it.
Once I found out he was a bird lover, well, it all made sense.
- And everything was at Radio Shack?
- Everything but the hat.
You know what, Hal?
Your solution was so brilliant, would you mind walking me through it one more time, step-by-step, just so I understand it completely?
Honey, no, it was so exhausting.
I don't think I'll talk about it ever again.
Well, I suppose it's for the best.
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Good dinner, honey.
Thanks.
I'm stunned I had time to cook anything.
Traffic was horrible, and then on the way to the market I hit a possum.
You're kidding.
It was just awful.
It laid there moaning and dying.
I didn't know what to do.
So I finally called Animal Services.
I waited and waited, nobody ever came.
I was so upset.
I never did have time to get to the store.
If you never made it to the store, then what are we eating?
Something from the freezer.
Finish it.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.13 - Tiki Lounge Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com I'll pick up Dewey from his piano lesson.
And you're waiting for the dry wall guy?
Yeah, but you got to get the vacuum.
I'll take the boys for their haircuts, and go pay the phone bill.
All right.
By the way, the dermatologist called.
He said that the lump on my back is just Don't put it out with more fire, moron!
Oh, my God.
I don't care if it's only a little poisonous.
Get rid of it.
So he said it was just an ingrown hair.
What?
The lump.
Oh, good.
That was 18 hours ago.
That's the last time we talked to each other?
Oh, my God.
I mean, oh, my God.
We talk to each other 20 seconds a day?
!
Don't worry, honey.
This is a problem, but I will take care of it.
For the next five days, you boys will be my slaves.
It will be miserable, hard, exhausting work, but Nope, that's it.
Just miserable, hard work.
So no matter what we have planned or how busy we are, you're okay with exploiting us for child labor?
Good, we're clear.
Let's get to work.
Come to Papa.
Dad?
Oh, no, you don't, Reese.
No way.
You give the nail gun to Dewey.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Herkabe?
Malcolm, one of the many perks of working in the glamorous field of public education is the constant opportunity to suddenly increase your workload.
It's as big a morale booster as the constant chiseling of gum from one's shoes You know, you can come right out and tell me how you're screwing me over.
You don't have to make a speech every time.
Be patient.
Yesterday I was informed that all faculty members must serve as advisors to at least one of the school's many clubs and organizations.
I've been assigned the North High Boosters.
And you're telling me because?
It's coming.
The Boosters are only nine members, which makes it a group.
We need ten for it to be a club.
And if it isn't a club, I don't get my $200 advisor fee.
You want me to join?
I love it when a victim fully grasps the horror.
You have proved a worthy patsy.
I don't want to be in your stupid club.
It's not a club until you joined keep up.
Okay, what's the blackmail?
Why must you rush these things?
As Vice Principal, I write the college recommendations.
I've written two for you.
One has your complete academic record.
The other has your complete academic record and a short paragraph about your personality.
That's not fair!
The meeting starts at 3:15 tomorrow.
Come early if you want spirit cookies.
Keep 'em closed.
Almost there.
Hal, you spun me around 50 times.
I still know we're going to the garage.
Okay, open 'em.
Oh, Hal, it's It's beautiful.
Well, I didn't do it all myself.
The boys worked their butts off.
You know, that's a working wet bar.
And a real New Zealand Mocking Mask.
Congratulations, boys, you did a fantastic job.
Now, if you set one foot in here, I will cripple you.
What?
From now on, every night from 6:00 to 7:00 is "tiki time".
Tiki time means your mother and I will be in here, alone, with no questions, no interruptions, no communication from you boys of any kind.
Malcolm, you'll cover any of your mom's shifts at Lucky Aide.
Reese, Dewey, baby-sit Jamie.
But No buts.
You're the ones who ruined our relationship in the first place.
Hal He needs changing.
Aloha.
I would like to officially welcome my young friend Malcolm to the North High Booster Club.
It's a very rewarding day for all of us, who care so much about Whatever it is you do.
Phillip?
First, let's review our Food for the Homeless program.
Wayne?
Good news, Boosters, we raised $428 at our rad "Bowling For Hobos" event.
Unfortunately, the decorating budget got away from us.
We spent $425 on the balloons.
But I think we might be able to salvage this by taking that three dollars and buying the homeless a really nice card.
Great idea.
Good save, Wayne.
All right, Stephanie, what about our pancake breakfast for the Abused Children's Counseling Center?
It's gonna be awesome.
We have tons of decorations and hundreds of balloons.
Maybe if you eased up on the balloons, you'd have some more money for the counseling center.
I don't think abused children want to eat some glumy undecorated room.
I mean, after what they've been through, let's not abuse their sense of taste.
- Yeah.
- Absolutely.
Let's move on to our Monte Carlo Night for the school library.
This year we've invested in a professional Bingo caller.
It's going to be insane.
And Malcolm?
What?
I'm awake.
Don't worry.
We've saved a really important job just for you.
You are going to be our Monte Carlo Night auctioneer.
What?
That's right.
You're going to be in front of the whole school representing us.
Welcome aboard, Booster.
Point of order!
Can we start Smile Patrol before the kids go home?
Smile Patrol?
We thought it'd be fun to roam the halls for anyone who's not smiling and give them a ticket.
Meeting adjourned.
I think someone's going to have to write themselves up.
This is so unfair.
Yeah, when I grow up, I'm going to do exactly the same thing to my kids.
Yeah, mine are going to pay big time.
By the time I came back, there were adult diapers all over the loading dock.
That's wonderful.
Oh, I hear a coconut that needs refreshing.
One more Beach Frolic coming up.
- So, go on.
- I'm finished.
That's my entire day.
Mine, too.
Huh, how about that?
Do you realize that we have never told each other our entire day before?
That's amazing.
That's something else I've never told you.
Think, Lois.
I want to know everything.
I had a pet turtle named Lee Majors.
He gave my whole family salmonella.
I thought I loved you four seconds ago.
I want out of the Booster club.
You can blackmail me all you want, but those kids are stupid, the auctioneer job is stupid, the whole thing blows and I'm quitting.
Someone's putting the "boo" in booster.
Did you see the crap they're trying to auction?
scrapbook lessons, a 15-minute neck massage from Earl the janitor.
Nobody wants that stuff.
I'm out of there.
Good for you.
Go right ahead.
What?
I officially stopped caring at 2:15 when I was handed this check.
And now I can finally splurge on new brake pads and treat my Civic like the lady that she is.
You should really learn to trust me, Malcolm.
It worked out well for everyone.
I got my money, you get to quit, and the Boosters get to be rid of you.
What are you talking about?
They don't like you any more than you like them.
They think you're too lazy and selfish to be Booster material.
You're lying.
- Oh, my God, you care.
- No, I don't.
They're a bunch of hypocrites pretending to be into charity just to have an excuse to throw parties and socialize and be surrounded by balloons.
Is this going to devolve into you shamble in around the quite come next June desperate for someone to sign your yearbook?
Calling me selfish and lazy?
I could raise ten times the money those idiots ever could!
Please.
You're not seriously thinking of "showing them a thing or two," are you?
Shut up!
Jamie Come on, just try it.
It's easy.
What are you doing?
He's trying to teach Jamie to smoke.
Since we're stuck watching him, I figured we might as well do something cool with him.
What's cooler than a smoking baby?
Why don't you just shoot him out of a cannon?
Come on, he could be famous.
You know, "Jamie, that smokin' baby".
He could do talk shows or tour with rock bands.
But he doesn't even care.
Give him a break.
He's not even two.
I'm not mad that he won't light the cigarette.
I'm mad that he won't try.
I think he's stupid.
Look, pal, we missed the chance to raise you inside a Sparklet's bottle.
This is our last shot.
We're not going to move.
We're going to sit here for as long as it takes.
Aw, man!
You did that on purpose.
You going to play it that way, fine.
Now it's war.
I miss the rotary phone, too.
It made you slow down.
Think about what you're gonna say.
Yeah, exactly.
Now it's bup-bup-bup and there they are whether you're ready or not.
This is wonderful.
Just think, when we get to heaven we'll feel like this all the time.
Wouldn't that be nice?
What do you mean?
I mean, it would be nice, heaven.
You mean it will be nice.
I just don't personally believe in that.
Well, okay, maybe not the clouds and the harps and angels, but you do believe in some kind of heaven, right?
Okay, so you don't believe in heaven, but you do believe in some kind of paradise where our two souls will go spend eternity.
I'm just not much of an afterlife person.
Wait a minute, Lois.
Where are good people rewarded and bad people punished?
Right here on Earth, if I have anything to say about it.
How is it I didn't know about this until now?
Well, I guess we just never had time to talk about it.
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah.
It's silly to ruin tiki time over this.
I will refresh our drinks.
Oh, I can't do this!
You've ruined it.
Why?
Because for the last 20 years I've assumed we'd be spending eternity together.
And if you don't believe that, then you won't be there.
Is that the rule?
Nothing about this place is right anymore.
It feels like that New Zealand Mocking Mask is mocking me.
Hal, I didn't say this to upset you.
I know Can we talk about it?
I think we've talked enough.
I'm going to go take kind of a long walk now.
But you stay.
Enjoy your rum-tumbler.
Look at me play with this great toy, and I'm not gonna share it!
Whee!
This is fun!
I'm not gonna turn around.
Is he getting pissed?
He's eating his foot.
Nice cover.
I'm getting to him.
You're having a feud with a toddler.
And you don't think he's playing that for all it's worth?
Well, tiki time is over.
You boys don't have to baby-sit anymore.
And Monte Carlo Night is starting to shape up really nicely.
We've got really cool-looking plastic champagne glasses, and we've also got six-channel walkie-talkies so we can be in constant audio contact in all sectors of the gymnasium.
I also took it upon myself to raise the balloon budget.
I figure if we're not going mylar, then why even bother?
Okay, great, Victor.
All right, and that brings us to the auction.
It's gonna be horrible, but not because I'm not busting my butt.
I've been hitting up people all around town, trying to get decent stuff that people will actually bid on, but no one's interested!
Well, I'm sure you're doing the best that you can.
Meeting adjourned.
I can't believe that this is what happens when you actually try.
Um, Good Night.
- Why can't we just get past this?
- I don't know.
Why the hell did we think that talking to each other was a good idea?
We were having fun and we got greedy.
Now look at us.
We used to have no time at all for each other, and it worked great.
We should warn people.
Write a book.
Go on Oprah.
- You know what would help?
- What?
If you changed your mind and told me that you believed in heaven.
You want me to lie to you?
It's not lying if what you say would be true if the facts were different.
I'll work with whatever you give me.
If you just say the words, you'll be giving me a tiny little gray area where I can live in peace for the rest of my life.
I can live in gray, Lois.
Let me live in gray!
Hal, I'm sorry, I have to tell you the truth.
Why?
Because it's what I believe in.
It's what I hang onto.
The truth is all that I have.
If I could give it up for anybody, I would give it up for you, but I just can't.
Heaven's going to suck!
We have to be home by 9:30.
The baby-sitter said her halfway house goes into lockdown at 10:00.
Did she tell you about the mobile over Jamie's crib?
She said it looked like somebody took a saw and cut almost all tugh it.
That's weird.
It's not like he has any enemies or anything.
Hey, Malcolm, the place looks great.
Look at all these balloons.
This is going to be a fun night.
If watching your son be humiliated in front of the whole school is your idea of fun.
What are you talking about?
You're finally getting the attention you always wanted.
Oh, come on, honey.
I know you're upset.
Let's try to have some fun tonight.
Sure.
If the here and now is all we've got, then let's enjoy it in all its beauty and wonder.
I'll get us some churros.
Hello, Malc.
- Malc?
- Forgive me, I'm feeling very odd tonight.
What is it called when you look around and you are not filled with festering rage?
- Being moderately happy?
- That is it!
I am moderately happy.
I have brake pads, and enough left overfor a side mirror.
And now I find that there's a wine tasting booth with an incredibly underpriced Riesling, just 25 cents a glass.
So, if you'll excuse me, I think I saw a slightly drunk Ms. Bartlett headed for the ladies' room.
I can't wait to see the look on Jamie's face tomorrow when he tries to tickle what's left of Elmo.
Then he'll be sorry he started this.
Stupid baby.
Reese, let me ask you.
When you end up in a situation like this, does it ever even occur to you to stop and figure out how you got there?
And let him win?
I mean, what do you do when your concept of eternity is wrapped up in a person that doesn't believe in eternity?
I mean, does this eternity even exist?
You might want to talk to a senior.
That's it, Mr. Herkabe, you just broke the North High bank.
Sometimes you're kissed by the gods.
Your trip to the corndog cart has been comped.
I should hope so.
Ladies.
I've been working hard, and I do care about this, but all your stuff blows.
Don't worry, Malcolm.
Just go up there and do your best.
And don't be nervous.
No one's expecting much.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the Monte Carlo Night auction.
Please gather around.
It's a wonderful night and a wonderful cause.
I have to say that the members of the North High Boosters have really taught me so much about the true spirit of charity.
So instead of the items listed in the program, we came up with some new items, which I think people will be very excited to bid on.
First item up: Our own Stephanie Wright has agreed to put up for auction, a photograph of herself from eighth grade With her original nose!
Ten dollars!

- 50 dollars!
60!
70!

Over 200 dollars in 30 seconds.
I think we've shown what the Booster spirit is really all about.
That is so much money!
We're raising so much money!
For an extra 50 dollars, I'll throw in a picture of me from before fat camp!

80!
90!
Our next item up for bid is me.
I will let the top bidder cover my mouth with duct tape every morning for a week.
Well, that was quite an auction.
Yeah.
This was one of the best nights of my life.
And I actually did something about myself.
I was having this giant conflict about my principles, but it was really just about my own pride.
And all I had to do to fix it is get over myself.
Excuse me.
Hal?
I've changed my mind.
I do believe in heaven.
I knew it!
Oh, I always knew you believed in heaven.
Keep the whistle.
I'm good.
Jamie, we need to talk.
I'm calling a truce.
I know you're willing to keep going it gets, and I respect that.
But I realized something.
Malcolm and Dewey are both geniuses, so they're gonna team up against us.
And since you and I are both mentally the same, we should team up, too.
Otherwise, they're gonna do something horrible to us, and we probably won't even understand it.
So here.
Hey, thanks.
Reese, what the hell is wrong with you?
!
What?
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
You flush the toilet, and I open the curtain.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.14 - Ida Loses A Leg Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com Grandma's visiting again.
Sometimes she can't spread enough misery with just a phone call.
She must have felt a vibration of happiness at the edge of her web and came scurrying down just to crush it.
The worst thing is how it affects Mom.
Mom, I took 20 bucks from your purse.
I'm never going to pay it back.
I don't care who started it, you and your brother work it out.
See?
It's sad.
Oh!
Lois, I keep finding your mother's teeth everywhere.
Is she spitting them out or are they escaping?
She must be wearing her smoking teeth.
Those are her fancy teeth.
Look, I can't fight every battle with her, Hal.
I got her to smoke outside.
That's today's victory.
Now that I have a car, I'm leaving and I'm never coming back.
No, Dewey, please don't go.
We didn't know it was the baby's thermometer.
It's too late for apologies.
I'm out of here.
Dewey, just name your price.
We'll do anything.
You think this is about money?
This is about respect Oh, crap.
Dad, chili for breakfast?
Hey, Jamie ate two bowls and you don't hear him complaining.
Why isn't Mom back from Grandma's yet?
For God's sakes, Reese, your grandmother lost a leg.
Show a little compassion for your mother who's stuck there taking care of that miserable hag.
She'll be back when she gets back.
And don't take this out on me.
I'm not the one who walked into the street.
But no one's blaming you for this, Dewey.
Dad, I already feel awful about it.
Which is exactly what I'm telling you not to do.
You need to stay positive.
Think about how good you'll feel next time when you remember to look both ways.
Shouldn't you boys be getting ready for school?
Didn't you hear?
They went to four-hour days.
It's shameful.
- The taxpayers won't even support - Forget it, Reese.
You are not going to misbehave this week.
Your mother already thinks I can't be trusted to watch you boys.
Like somehow I'm going to do something idiotic and irresponsible.
Hey, look at this.
Some kid fell asleep at a frat party and another kid glued his face to the floor.
Can you imagine what that looked like?
Just regular old Super Glue.
We've got a ton of that stuff in our garage.
Where do people get these ideas?
Mother, I was getting the door for you.
I don't need your pity!
I'm fine!
No, you are not fine.
You need to relax.
If you keep thrashing around, the doctor says it'll make your leg bleed again.
Ha!
Scare tactics those butchers tell you so you'll get weak and they can sell you more go-go pills.
There and there.
I helped get her moved back in and I spent some time in her place.
My obligation is fulfilled.
Have fun you two.
Get back in here.
We are not having this argument again.
Let him go.
It's the little one that owes me his life.
See, even she thinks so.
Francis, everyone elsen in this family has either school or a job.
So you're staying here and helping your grandmother.
I don't need help.
Look at him.
He has nothing between his legs and he manages.
- If you think I'm above punching you, you are totally wrong.
- Of course you'd hit a cripple.
You couldn't even get a white girl to marry you.
Stop it both of you.
Can you go at least five seconds without screaming at each other?
- I am sick of you!
- You stupid Nancy boy!
- You dried up old hag!
If I had been driving that truck myself - You ought to strangle yourself Well, I wonder which nightmare I'm going to have tonight.
"The Forest of Severed Legs" or "Drowning in Grandma's Blood"?
Well, good night.
I'm going to sleep like a baby tonight.
Me, too.
Nothing's going to wake me up.
Same here.
Well good night.
Good night.
What's under your pillow?
What's under your pillow?
I think we both know what's under these pillows.
I guess we do.
- Good morning.
- Good morning.
I feel great.
Ready to start the day.
Me, too.
- Think I'll brush my teeth.
- I'll join you.
Jamie, I am not kidding.
You have to the count of three to eat these peas.
One Two Three!
All right.
But one of these days you are going to learn that I am serious.
Dad, I've been thinking a lot about Grandma losing her leg.
I mean, Grandma lost her leg saving my life, but she doesn't really want to talk to me, so I figure the least I can do is honor her leg.
You know, pay it some decent last respects.
Like maybe have a funeral for it or something.
Dewey, you just can't do that.
The leg is medical waste.
The hospital has to process it and do whatever they do with that stuff.
How about this?
Tomorrow, we go in the garage and make your grandmother a peg.
You can paint it like a candy cane.
No, I want the leg.
You can't get a leg, Dewey.
That's just not going to happen.
Hello, Pathology?
Yes, this is Judy Green from Dr. Weiss' office.
I'm calling about the chop-and-drop he did Thursday on the old lady.
Listen, Dr. Weiss thinks he may have left his wedding ring in that leg.
He was pretty hammered.
Yeah, again.
So anyway, we need to get that leg out of there before the lawyers come around and do their Monday-morning quarterbacking.
You know what, instead of the usual place, just send it to my house.
I'll give you the address.
I don't care if you knew the end of that Star Trek episode!
I didn't and you ruined it!
- You can't let anyone else be happy!
- Shut up, monkey!
Anyone with half a brain could see the rocks were alive!
Both of you, stop it!
Francis, it does not matter how horribly you act, you are not getting out of this!
You are stuck here, so suck it up!
And you you are old and injured and you need his help.
All your yelling and viciousness does not equal physical strength.
You cannot bully a can of soup down off the shelf.
You cannot scream it down.
You need his help.
Yeah, you old bat, where's your gratitude?
Francis I am not asking you to do this for her, I'm asking you to do this for me.
I am leaving in a few days and I need to know she's being taken care of.
You have to find some way you can get along with her.
But she's horrible.
I know, I know, but just try.
Find something you have in common, something you can agree on.
I don't think that's possible.
For God sakes, you both have such huge reservoirs of hate, you're telling me there's no overlap?
What about boy bands?
Mom, you hate boy bands, right?
They're making a living, give them a break.
You see?
You're not getting out of this so easily.
You stay here and you figure it out right now.
Hey, Ida, don't you hate how bossy my mom is?
Oh God, she's awful.
Always ordering me around, making me jump through hoops for her like every day is her birthday.
And God forbid you forget her birthday.
Then it's martyr time for the next five weeks.
And for what?
Everyone knows it's a made-up holiday anyway.
And those stupid cards?
Money in the garbage.
Oh, God yes!
What a scam.
It's like, "La-la, I'm old, so here's a stupid cartoon with boobs on it".
Exactly.
No one really remembers the day they had their child.
They pretend they do to feel important.
I haven't slept in two days.
I cut school just to have some time in the house without Reese.
I just need an hour.
A half hour.
Any sleep at all, then I'll have a jump on him.
You can't win this on strength.
You've got to win it on planning.
You saved yourself this time.
But your reactions will get slower.
And I'll be waiting.
Wait!
Reese, wait!
This is so stupid.
We're both ruining our lives over it.
I got a "B" on my History midterm.
I fell asleep beating up a kid.
- We have to stop this.
- I totally agree.
Okay.
Truce?
Truce.
She wears a size 8½ shoe just like me.
Why, Dewey?
Just checking.
Thanks, Mom.
Okay.
Prince Charming looking for Cinderella.
That's all it is.
- Grandma, hold still.
I can't re-dress your wound until I clean it.
- Your breath is disgusting.
Do you see what I'm doing, and you're complaining about ?
I will go brush my teeth as soon as I'm done.
We are gathered here today to pay tribute to a leg.
A leg that saved me.
But also kicked me, and stomped on my toes a lot.
But that wasn't your idea.
Anyway, uh I'm sorry.
I just thought once I had the hole and the severed leg in front of me the words would come naturally.
Dad, what are you doing home?
Dewey, I know you need your time alone, but I did something I think is gonna make you feel a lot better.
Actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
I kept thinking, "There must be some way I can help take little Dewey's mind off all this".
"There must be some way I can put the fun back in his life".
Of course, your mom is probably going to hit the roof when she finds out, but you just let me handle that, huh?
Dad, what are you talking about?
I'm talking about a lovable furry playmate who you can spend years with, frolicking and Oh, my God!
- What the hell is he eating?
- What is who eating?
Your dog!
You have him for two seconds and this is what happens?
!
I didn't ask for a dog!
- Who brings a dog to a leg funeral?
!
- A leg funeral?
!
- Dewey, after I said ?
- You didn't say not to, you just said I wouldn't be able to!
This is me with your Uncle Vlad.
This is the only picture of him sober.
And there's Cousin Rega.
You smile at her, she jumps into bed with you.
And what's wrong with this person?
What was his moral failing?
My dear old friend, Peter.
Look at him, holding a menu like he could read.
- Wait, who's that little girl with you and Grandpa?
- Oh, Mom, don't you want to watch the news?
Who's that little girl?
That's you, you big sissy!
This was the time your mother sent you to live with us.
What?
Come on.
It wasn't "to live" with you.
It was six months.
It felt like forever.
We put you in a dress because you wouldn't pee like a boy.
I don't remember any of this!
And you never paid me for the food he ate.
Oh, God, what whining; "I want my Mommy.
Where's my family, Ooh, you're scaring me"!
Blah, blah, blah.
What's going on?
Francis, it was a very difficult time.
Your father was changing jobs, and then Reese came along.
He was like a whole pack of wolves by himself.
It was just too much.
You were a horrible child.
You tore a huge gash in your side trying to get out through the window.
- That's what this is from?
- You cried like a baby when I tried to sew you up.
I was a baby!
You dumped me off and you left me with this monster?
!
- Francis, it's not the way you're thinking.
You don't even remember it.
- No, but you know what?
It's good to know.
It's really nice to know that as a toddler, your own mother couldn't wait to get rid of you.
- Francis - Actually, I should thank you.
'Cause you waited till I was 15 before you kicked me out for good.
That must have been so hard for you.
You can't judge me for this.
You weren't there.
And whose fault was that?
!
How did you get in here?
Nobody liked looking at you when you were alive.
Okay what's going on?
Look, I got into this thing with Reese and it's way out of hand.
I haven't slept in three days.
If you could just do me a favor, just be on lookout for Reese.
If I can get one hour of sleep, then I can have the upper hand and I can end this.
- Okay.
- Thank you.
Wait a minute.
Why'd you say okay?
- What?
- I mean, I just told you and you said okay like it wasn't a big deal.
It seems like you'd at least want to think about it for a little bit.
Unless this was a setup.
That's what this is, isn't it?
-What's going on in here?
What are you guys up to?
-Oh, nice cover.
You two have a side deal!
No!
Or maybe you're just trying to make me think we have a side deal.
- Why would I do that?
- Exactly!
Don't try to make me think that you're confused, because I know you aren't.
- Why would I want you to think that?
!
- Because There's some angle that I'm not seeing, but I'll get it.
- Nice bluff!
- Nice fake-out!
Oh, yeah?
Well, you can play all the smart games you want, but I'm not gonna let you get away with it.
I'll glue my own face to the floor!
Then what are you gonna do, huh?
That'd be the perfect way to make me let my guard down, wouldn't it?
!
Stevie, I know you'll be mature enough, not to do anything, I would do Come on, Champion.
Come on, boy.
You don't want that nasty old leg, do you?
- Okay, just kidding.
Sorry.
- Dad, he's ruining it!
- Throw another steak in there.
- I am not going to waste another steak.
He's not going for it, and it was $12 a pound.
It was not!
It was bargain meat, and he knows the difference.
I am doing my best here, son.
Oh, boy.
He's gonna finish the whole thing!
- Call 911!
- Dewey, what part of thislooks like authorities should be involved?
God, if only your grandmother wasn't so damned tasty.
Now there's no way to feel better.
Now I have to feel bad forever.
Oh, Dewey.
Maybe you can try and think about it this way.
Your grandmother She is the most horrible woman who ever lived, but even she understands the difference between a life that's been lived and a life with potential.
You want to pay her back?
Live up to that potential.
And if you think about it, you might have done her a big favor.
Let's face it.
Saving your life is her only chance of getting into heaven.
Which isn't going to make you that popular in heaven, but we'll deal with that later.
Okay.
Hey, Dad?
Is it okay if we don't keep the dog?
Yeah, that sounds fair.
- Grandma, you have to sit still or I can't get the bandage on.
- Just keep your eyes on the stump, Romeo.
Well, okay I put all the doctors' numbers on the fridge.
The safety rail is up in the shower.
Thank you, Francis.
- I have to tell you something.
- What?
I wasn't a good enough mother to you and I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left you with her, and I shouldn't have sent you to military school.
I got overwhelmed and I took things out on you that weren't your fault.
They were my fault, and I'm sorry.
But?
But nothing.
I'd like to think I was a little bit better with the other boys, but that's just further proof that you got a terrible deal.
Yes, boo-hoo for the boy with two legs.
You deserved a mother who was more patient and more caring, and it breaks my heart that you didn't get that mother.
Thank you.
Wow.
Wow.
Wow.
I've just waited so many years to hear you say that.
Why don't I feel better?
What do you mean?
I mean, I actually had fantasies where you said that, pretty much word-for-word.
It's spooky how close it is, but it's not helping.
Why didn't it help?
!
- You want me to say something else?
- No, no, I mean, you said everything!
Anything else would just be fake.
I mean, that was like the perfect thing, and I am still filled with all this resentment.
Oh, my God, this sucks!
That was, like, the one thing I was living for and it's just not working at all!
- Can you take the soap opera outside?
I want to watch the whore that gives the weather.
- Mother, please!
- Just try to breathe.
- No!
You can't just have your life dream stripped away from you and be okay about it!
- Do you want a cold washcloth?
- I don't think so.
- I don't know.
I don't know what I want.
- Do you want me to give you some money?
How much money?
I have $200.
I only need $30 for the bus.
Okay.
Here.
And the Tic Tacs.
Okay, honey, just remember that I love you.
- In my own imperfect, bad mothering way, I do love you.
- I love you, too.
I'll call you.
Okay, Rockefeller, it's lotion time.
Cut your nails.
Jennifer, cut it out!
You're so bad.
Your breath smells like feet.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
There's a head of rotten lettuce in the fridge.
Not strong enough.
Why don't you dig out whatever it was that died under the furnace?
Still not strong enough!
What about the old boot that opossum gave birth in?
It's out in the garage.
Perfect!
All yours.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.15 - Chad's Sleepover Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com I'm sorry I'm late.
My alarm clock didn't go off and then there was an accident and and road workers and Where is everybody?
Well, it's Ditch Day.
None of the students came in.
No one told me there was a ditch day.
Well, I'm surprised you didn't hear.
I mean, everyone was telling their friends.
Oh All right, Charisse, the professor of boozology has some homework for you.
What's he doing here?
No one told him.
Oh, my God.
- You could probably use a little - Val, stop that.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
What?
You are going to die!
What is it?
I know I always say that gossip rots your soul, but it doesn't count when it's this good.
Last night, I covered for Bernice so she could leave early, and when she got home, she found Charlie standing in their living room wearing her red cocktail dress!
The one from the Christmas party with all the feathers!
Good God!
He admitted it's been going on for years.
He said it started one day when he accidentally used lipstick instead of Chap Stick.
The next thing you knew, he was wearing a teddy under his police uniform.
Man is a complicated beast.
Can you imagine keeping something like that from your spouse?
So glad we don't have any secrets.
What is it?
Oh, honey, there's something I should confess to you.
What?
!
I I spent more than $50 on your last birthday present.
I know we agreed not to, but I just love you so much.
Well, I'm glad you told me.
It felt good to come clean.
Dad, can I have a sleepover tomorrow?
Somebody wants to sleep over?
Here?
That's fantastic!
Who?
Chad from my class.
Oh, geez, Dewey, I don't think that's a good idea.
That kid is really He's fine.
He's just a little strange.
Nothing to be scared of.
Well, it's not anything to be taken lightly, either.
That boy has a lot of serious issues.
I don't think you know what you're getting into.
Yes, I do.
I also know people treat him like a freak for no reason.
Even his parents have given up on him.
They're just looking for an excuse to have him institutionalized.
This is supposed to be convincing me?
Dad, I want to prove that he can do normal stuff like a normal kid and have a normal life.
No means no, Dewey.
No doesn't always mean no.
This isn't "PG-movie" no, this is "speargun" no.
Dad, listen.
I never ask for anything, but I'm asking you to do this for me.
It's important.
I'm sorry, Dewey, but I know a little bit more about this than you do.
And you ask for things all the time.
So where'd you go today?
Oh, man, it was fantastic.
Went down o the pet store, fed a bunch of the pets to the other pets, ended up at the supermarket, where I squeezed all the Wonder Bread into balls till the manager threw me out.
I left a little present in his convertible.
Well, it was somebody's convertible.
You couldn't have bothered to tell me about Ditch Day?
There was a ditch day?
!
Yeah, today.
No one told me.
Why didn't they tell me?
Because no one likes us, Reese.
No one.
Everybody else was told about it.
Even that slow kid who ate cat litter for a dollar.
Ducky?
How did Ducky get so popular?
It's not that he's popular, it's that we're unpopular.
Oh, my God.
I'm as unpopular as you.
Guess who's getting a treat?
That's right, it's you, Mr. Boy.
In this house, whenever anybody is good for three whole days in a row, they get one of Mama's extra special fruit smoothies.
I have never made one before.
Oh, this is outrageous!
What's the matter?
The blender is broken.
There's no excuse for this!
Honey, we have had it since before Dewey was born.
I don't care.
They said a lifetime guarantee.
A lifetime is not ten or eleven years.
Hal, if they want to say a ten or eleven-year guarantee, that's fine.
I'll make my blender-buying decisions accordingly, but they said "lifetime".
I'm getting my money back or a blender of equal or greater value.
How are you going to find the warranty from ten years ago?
I'm sure it's with the rest of the papers in the garage.
Honey, you'll never find it out there.
What did this cost, $19?
That's what they want you to say!
That's why they don't charge more!
That's how they get you!
You expecting somebody?
Uh, yeah, it's Chad.
He's sleeping over tonight.
Dewey's having a sleepover?
Yeah, we didn't have any plans.
I thought it would be nice.
Dewey, your friend's here!
Hold on.
I told you no, and you went behind my back and tricked your mother into letting you have this sleepover?
I just told her it'd be a nice thing to do for a kid who doesn't have many nice things in his life.
If you call that a trick, then yeah.
You don't have to freak out.
I know how to handle Chad.
You can't believe everything you read in the special needs bulletin.
They only say that stuff to get extra funding.
That is not the point!
Dewey, I made myself very clear.
I told you no, and you snuck around my back to you mother as if nothing I said had any impact Hello, there!
You must be Chad's parents.
- Yes.
I'm Lloyd.
- Lloyd.
- And this is Evelyn.
- Evelyn.
And this - God, where did he go?
!
- I watched him from the car to the door.
Do I have to do everything?
!
Excuse me.
Thank you for inviting me.
Hi, Chad.
Hey, Dewey.
We want to thank you for doing this.
I think it's wonderful the boys are getting together.
Big books go on the bottom shelf.
What did we tell you about touching their things?
!
Are you trying to prove that you can't go out in public?
!
This is your last chance, do you understand me, buddy?
!
- This is your last chance!
- Lloyd, do something!
You do something!
The gene was on your egg.
Oh, yeah, it's completely my fault.
Now can we go to dinner?
At bedtime, these straps are for his arms, and these are for his legs.
If you wind up needing to use the harness, make sure he doesn't take a big breath in when you're fastening the buckles, otherwise, he can wriggle out and the whole thing is useless.
Completely useless.
Say good-bye to your parents, Chad.
Good-bye.
Here's a list of emergency numbers.
Don't try 911.
They're not qualified.
Maybe they meant to tell us.
They just forgot.
They didn't forget.
How could the whole school snub us like this?
Don't they realize how much this hurts?
They don't care.
There are people in this world that are just plain evil.
And every single person at that school is one of those people.
No, we can't do this.
We can't keep blaming everybody else whenever something like this happens.
It can't be an accident that you and I alienate so many people.
We're never going to make our lives better if we keep pretending they are the problem.
Then what do we do?
Well, I mean, if we really want to figure this out, maybe we need to look at ourselves honestly.
You're right.
What's wrong with us?
Well, some parts are easy.
- I mean, you're a ruthlessly brutal thug.
- I have my moods.
And look how it was my first impulse to criticize you.
It just shows what a pompous ass I am.
I do seem to cause a lot of needless suffering.
I usually assume that people are my enemy.
I have this need to show off.
It's not enough that I know more than everyone.
I have to make sure they know I know more.
Why do I do that?
Don't ask me.
I know less than everyone.
When I walk into a room, it seems like everybody's talking about things that I could never understand.
And when they laugh, I'm always sure that they're laughing at me.
Maybe we're both afraid.
We're afraid people won't like us.
That's why I show off how smart I am and that's why you hit people.
We're scared of being rejected, so we act in a way that pushes people away.
Oh, man.
It's the thing that we hate the most, and yet we keep making it happen again and again.
We're so stupid and pathetic.
Or they're jealous!
Yeah, totally jealous.
I mean, they see us, and they don't want to face that they're all jealous, so they make us act all angry and superior!
They're in denial.
I am really glad we did this.
Rough can't go next to smooth.
This is exactly what I talked about, Dewey.
He's gone through practically everything in the house.
He taped my ties to my shirts.
So the house gets straightened up.
- Wouldn't that be horrible?
- Don't you trivialize this.
You're in enough trouble already.
I'm telling you, once he settles down, this is going to be a perfectly normal sleepover.
- We're going to play a board game, we're going to watch a video, we're going to have pizza - No pizza.
I'm already defrosting hamburgers.
But I promised Chad pizza.
He really likes pizza.
No pizza, Dewey.
You are on thin ice as it is.
From now on, you are going to do exactly as I say.
Is that understood?
Yes, Dad, I got it.
Now can I go play with my friend?
Where'd he go?
You'll see a lot of this in life, Jamie.
The big blender company's don't think we're smart enough to save warranties.
They think we run around barefoot all day picking bugs off ourselves.
Well, they are in for a big surprise.
They design their products specifically to break down three days after the warranties get lost.
It's called "planned obsolescence," like that deathtrap of a highchair you keep falling over in.
I'm their worst nightmare, Jamie; a woman who saves everything.
And I'm going to go through every shred of it.
What's that, Mr. Big-Blender-Company man?
You say I'm going to need paperwork?
Oh, gee, I don't know if I have it.
Oh, wait, I do.
Dewey, I told you to keep Chad away from my desk.
I just heard a whole bunch of kids from our school are going to stay overnight at that old abandoned house on Spires Road.
No one told me.
Big shock.
I say we go there tonight and scare the crap out of them.
- We're going to scare them for being jealous of us?
- No, we're going to scare them for being jerks.
All right, yeah.
Let's do it.
They think they can be jerks to us?
We'll show them what jerks are.
- Hi.
I got a half cheese, half pepperoni.
- What?
- That little - Listen, I'm kind of in a hurry.
It's $12.
- Just hold on a second.
- Dewey!
You get your butt in here right now, Mister!
Dad, what is wrong with you?
You can't go screaming in the house when Chad's here.
I am the parent in this house, and you do what I say!
Now when I tell you there is no pizza in this house, there's no pizza!
That is the law!
Dad Don't you "Dad" me.
You already "Dad-ed" me good with this sleepover.
You know what?
Sometimes if you're just being bigoted and unreasonable, maybe I don't have to listen to you.
You better listen to me.
- I am your father and you will respect - Hey, you know what?
This was supposed to go to 12336.
I bet you feel like a jackass.
I have something to tell you.
Hal, it will have to wait.
I wasted a half an hour getting Jamie to sleep.
He kept crying because I wouldn't let him have the antifreeze bottle in bed with him.
Lois, this is important.
I was trying to spare you the embarrassment, but you should probably know.
Dewey actually asked me first about the sleepover.
And he went to you when I said no.
Oh, sorry.
What do you mean, "sorry"?
Maybe you don't understand.
He went around my back to get to you.
And this is a big upset for you?
For God's sake, Hal, they go behind my back to get to you all the time.
That is very different.
You are the hard ass.
I'm the nice, fair one.
Dewey knows that.
Why would he betray me?
Hal, I cannot get worked up about this right now.
I have to find that warranty or the blender company wins.
Is that what you want, Hal?
Are you on their side?
Fine.
I'll help you.
No, Hal.
I have a system.
Anyway, it seems to be going fine.
I haven't heard a peep out of them in hours.
Hey, Chad, I can teach you to play Chinese checkers if you want.
Chad!
White on white Blue on blue And yellow on yellow.
Chad, don't do this.
If someone catches you you'll be in big trouble Dewey.
Just a minute.
Hello.
Oh, hello, Lloyd.
No, everything's going fine with Chad.
Well, you can bring it if you think he needs it.
We are going to scare the crap out of them.
You know what?
I don't feel sorry for them.
They've got it coming.
They deserve every stained pair of underwear they're about to get.
Hey, is my eye socket oozing enough?
It's perfect.
Okay, on the count of three we bust through the door.
If one of them has a heart attack, you resuscitate them and I'll scare them again.
Ready?
One two three.
What are you guys doing?
- Um - Um - Uh - Um Nothing.
You guys trying to scare us?
What, are you 12?
We weren't trying to scare you.
Of course not.
That's the opposite of what we were trying to do.
We're meeting girls here.
Then why are you dressed like that?
Because Um Uh Why don't you like us?
!
I got to say, they had some pretty solid reasons.
Come on, Chad.
You have to find some way to snap out of this.
Look, I went to bat for you.
I've been protecting you all day, but this is something I can't cover up.
And if your parents find out, they're going to put you away.
Are you listening?
Yes.
Green goes with green, goes with green, goes with green, goes with green, goes with green, goes with green Hello, Hal.
Evelyn, Lloyd, come on in.
So, we were halfway through our first dinner alone in a decade, when someone had to remind me that I didn't give Chad his good night pill.
Oh.
Okay, well, I'll just, uh, go get him.
This in no way justifies what you said before.
Chad, I want to show you a little project I've been working on.
Look at this.
You see where I took my pen and I filled in the letters that needed to be filled in.
The "O's," the "A's," the "E's," the "G's".
The "Q's," the "P's," the "D's" and the "B's"?
Of course.
That was you?
- What about the nines?
- Yes.
What about the circles and the percent signs?
Absolutely.
Otherwise you'll be left with that horrible feeling of uncompleteness.
Here they are, sleepover buddies.
Has he been okay?
Oh, he's been fine.
And I think people prejudge Chad sometimes.
He's a good kid.
Open.
I'm sorry, Dad.
I thought you were just being I mean, I had no idea you were So how crazy are you?
Let's just say that's my third set of encyclopedias.
If we leave right now, we can still catch the movie.
What's this?
The warranty?
Hey, good for you, Chad.
Well, I give up.
I'm throwing out that blender.
You don't have to.
Look what Chad did.
Pictures of things belong on the things they're pictures of.
Check and mate.
Dewey, what is it?
Hal?
Honey I'm sorry.
You were lying there asleep and you just looked so beautiful.
And the moment was perfect and I never wanted it to end.
And then I saw the camera, and And I'm weak, Lois.
I'm a little man.
I know that I can never apologize enough and I'm sure right now you don't even want to look at me.
Hal.
Everyone's going to hear about this.
We suck.
We totally suck.
I hate myself so much.
What is wrong with us?
Everyone else our age heard it "empty house," and we heard "haunted house".
Are we just socially stunted in some way that makes us hopeless?
I think half of them were really scared.
Yeah.
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Boy, when you wet the tip, this thing really cracks.
Hey, would you hold this for me?
What's that on the floor?
The poem I wrote about kittens.
That's so weird.
I guess I have no choice but to bend over wearing last year's shorts and pick it up.
He's really sick, Mom.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.16 - No Motorcycles Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com They're here.
They're here.
Francis and Piama are spending the weekend for Francis' birthday.
He's turning 21 tomorrow.
I haven't seen Dad this excited since he thought Francis turned 21 last year.
Hey, it's the birthday boy.
Or should I say birthday man?
I know you said not to bring anything, but I brought a salad.
Oh, thank you, Piama.
That's so thoughtful.
I'll just take it in the kitchen and rewash it.
Oh I am so excited.
Yeah, it's going to be a great party.
No, not the party.
The you know what.
Oh.
Yeah.
Thank you so much.
I've been looking forward to this for 12 years.
Yes, well it's going to be everything you dreamed it would.
This totally makes the Peter Pan thing worthwhile.
Peter Pan?
Peter Pan.
Peter Pan!
Oh, Francis, please.
Oh, God, I am so sorry.
I didn't know your school play was today.
You saw me leave in this costume.
Francis, please, stop crying.
I am so sorry.
Look, I'll do anything to make it up to you.
What do you want?
I'll do anything.
I want to go on a motorcycle trip like you always talk about.
Honey, that was way back in college.
And you know how your mother feels I want a motorcycle trip with my dad!
Okay.
Okay.
I'll tell you what.
When you turn 21, I promise I will take you on the most awesome, special motorcycle trip, okay?
We'll go when you turn 21.
Oh, yeah.
Motorcycle trip.
At first I thought you were just saying it to shut me up.
You're just saying this to shut me up.
No, son, this is a promise.
On the day of your 21st birthday, I swear by all that is holy, you and I will go on a father-son motorcycle trip, so help me God.
How are you going to get Mom to let you?
I swear on my life, Francis, nothing will stop this.
This is the holiest, most sacred promise between a father and a son.
Nothing, and I mean nothing, can ever undo this promise!
- Boy, I sure liked to nail things down, didn't I?
- Oh, yeah.
It's going to be great.
Wait, wasn't there?
This is sealed in blood.
Do you hear me, son?
Sealed in blood.
Oh, crap.
Okay, I'll pitch in three dollars for Francis' birthday present.
Me, too.
And three from me.
So we're agreed.
We're giving Francis nine dollars for his birthday.
Hey, your friend's outside.
What do you mean "friend"?
Your friend, Randy somebody.
Really big kid.
Randy Zane?
Yeah, I think he wants to play baseball.
What?
He's outside right now with his bat.
He seems really impatient.
You know, I told you boys if you just made an effort you could make friends.
You see?
You listened to me and it paid off.
Just think how much easier your lives would be if you listened to me all the time.
God, he looks mad.
Which one of us do you think he wants?
Reese, it's obviously you.
That must've been his bike that you superglued to the train tracks.
We don't know that.
You were pretty fast and loose with that dog-crap slingshot the other day.
How do you know you didn't hit him?
What about you?
How many people did you convince to buy those algebra pills?
You know, our lives would be a lot easier if we didn't all pull this crap at the same time.
I suggested a rotating calendar years ago, and you guys ignored me.
And here we are.
Let's just go tell Mom.
We can't.
If we send Mom out there, Randy will just tell her what we did, and then they'll both be after us.
Did you see that movie where Freddie teamed up with Jason?
Is that what you want?
Then what do we do?
He can't stand out there forever.
We'll just wait him out.
So what if we have to stay inside for awhile.
- Oh, my God, he's still out there.
- I think he grew.
Why is he smoking two cigarettes?
Those are his eyes.
Hal, what are you doing?
I'm just trying to think of some wise things to say to Francis tomorrow.
A father should have some wisdom for his son, don't you think?
Well, it is a big day.
You only turn 21 once.
Hey, remember before he was born and I had that Harley Da?
No motorcycles ever!
You do not talk about motorcycles.
You do not think, you do not wish, you do not even reminisce about those stupid, idiotic death traps.
They do not exist.
Motorcycles do not exist.
Say it.
- Motorcycles do not exist.
- What does not exist?
- I don't know.
- Good.
He was out there all night.
- Doesn't he get bored?
- Do sharks get bored?
You know what, we'll just stay inside all day today, too.
We can last longer than he can.
Mmm.
So that's your famous pasta sauce Francis talks so much about?
Yeah, I only make it for birthdays and acquittals.
One time it was both.
I just love the smell of home cooking.
Really?
Do you know there's a way to get that smell in your own house?
Okay, it's all set up.
The rental place is delivering two motorcycles to the gas station on 10th and Coolidge.
I already have a couple of satchels packed.
At 5:30, we'll just slip out and disappear.
This is so awesome.
So Francis, your birthday dinner starts at 6:00.
- I hope you're hungry.
- Oh, gosh, I sure am.
I'm hungry for all of it.
My only problem will be deciding which amazing side dish to eat first.
But I guess I'll solve that problem at 6:00 'cause that's when my birthday party starts.
Be cool.
We're going to be stuck in here forever.
It'll be fine.
Eventually, he'll get bored, or tired, or die of starvation.
But who knows how long that could take?
I'm going crazy here.
I mean, look at me, I'm reading a book.
This is dumb.
I'm not going to do this anymore.
I'm just going to go out and see if it's me he wants.
- What are you, nuts?
- I'm not going to live like this.
I've been beaten before.
I'm just going to get it over with and live the rest of my life.
God, he's walking right up to him.
Randy's hitting him.
He's hitting him.
It's not us.
You know, for a little kid, he can really take a punch.
I can't believe I've been going so easy on him.
Give me the tape, and I'll get this side.
Oh, I got it.
This tape dispenser is tricky.
It'll take me longer to explain it.
Dewey, are you okay?
Boy, that was a beating.
I mean, no offense to you guys, but "wow".
Why did he beat you up?
Did he say?
Actually, he said it wasn't me.
Then why'd he eat you up?
He said it was just a warm-up.
Then he said to send out my brother.
Which brother, me or Malcolm?
He just said "brother".
Boy, what a weight off.
It's just so great to have this over with.
I'm finally free.
And I'm getting some major tooth fairy money.
You know, Hal, I realized this afternoon we don't have any pictures from any of Francis' birthday parties.
I want you to make sure you have plenty of film in the camera.
Will do.
Get ready for a boatload of memories.
Uh, Dad.
Can you come out here for a second?
No, no, no, no, no.
These were supposed to go to the gas station.
That's what I'm telling him.
Look, this is the address that's on the credit card.
But these can't be anywhere near here.
You have to take them to the gas station.
I'm not even insured to touch these things once they're off the truck.
But you know, you want them taken down to the gas station, they are motorcycles.
Is everything okay out there, honey?
Fine, no problem.
Francis just wanted to make sure that we weren't wearing the same outfit tonight.
Okay, just help me get these into the garage.
Wow.
Those are cool.
Listen, do not say a word about this.
If you just stay quiet, I promise when you turn 21, I will take you on a trip with me on a rocket ship.
A rocket ship, Dewey.
I swear on my life.
I swear on everything that is sacred, as God is my witness.
Ow.
Oh, how did you?
I don't care.
Francis, come on, quickly.
- How do I?
- Just kick it into neutral and follow me.
Just turn left and gun it!
I call you later.
I love you.
This should have been the greatest day of our lives.
Dad and Francis rode motorcycles through the living room, and where were we?
Hiding under our beds.
"Oh, I'm really looking forward to dinner".
What a jerk.
I don't know what I'm gonna end up doing to him.
All I know is every stroke of this brush strengthens my killing arm.
Do you have another bucket?
I can get started on the tracks in the living room.
Oh, I'll just end up redoing them all myself anyway.
Why don't you just watch some TV?
Then you'll be out of the way.
Lois!
No one is as useless as you think I am!
My focus should be on hating my husband and planning revenge, not worrying about whether I belong here.
You are absolutely right.
I'm sorry.
You deserve better.
Thank you.
I appreciate that.
So now what?
Well, I don't know.
We're kind of in uncharted waters here.
- Drink?
- Absolutely.
Oh, man, what a day.
What a ride.
- That was fantastic!
- Yeah.
Just wait.
Tomorrow we go around the lake to this funky old hot springs you are gonna love.
This is the same route I used to take every month with my buddy, Roy, until he got dragged a quarter mile by that school bus.
Thanks for doing this, Dad.
You know, son, you should always pick battles that are big enough to matter, but small enough to win.
Yeah, okay.
I say life is the only real counselor.
Wisdom unfiltered through personal experience does not become part of the moral tissue.
Dad, you feeling okay?
Never mind.
Listen, I have got something really special for you.
You know, it's kind of a father-son thing to honor the occasion.
It was a little expensive, but I am going to sit with my 21-year-old son and share a 21-year-old bottle of Scotch.
The guy at Liquor Clown said this was the best.
Dad, I'm sorry.
I'm sober now.
I don't drink anymore.
- What?
- I'm sober now.
I went to AA.
What?
When did this happen?
Last year.
It just became a problem, and I kind of bottomed out, so I decided to get some help, and, I've been sober for six months now.
And you didn't tell me about this?
Well, I'm telling you now.
What good is it to tell me now?
I'm your father.
You could have come to me about this.
Instead you go to a bunch of strangers with drinking problems?
Well, I'm sorry I guess.
Which one of the 12 steps is the one where you act like your father doesn't exist?
Dad, what's the big deal?
It was my problem.
- I went, and I did what I needed to do to get help.
- I'm supposed to help you.
I deserved to know.
And meanwhile, I plan this whole trip, and now I find out you're sober, and I'm standing here with a bottle of booze like some kind of jackass.
You know, it's just a little tough Wow.
It's just little tough to find out.
Do you have any other surprises for me?
Do I have any grandchildren I never met?
- Do you have a boyfriend?
!
- Dad, come on.
This is a nice trip.
I want to just enjoy this.
I'm going to bed.
I liked the thing you said about picking battles.
I got it off a billboard.
Oh, look at this.
You got Francis a watch.
That was so nice of you.
This is a rare promotional Doobie Brothers EP.
Oh.
Hal almost cried when he found this at a yard sale.
- It still doesn't seem like enough.
- Oh, honey, this is just how we get the creative juices flowing.
It's tough.
You have to make your husband miserable, but I have to make mine miserable and make it a warning to the other three boys in the house.
- Do men ever think about what's gonna happen when they do these stupid things?
- No, that's what's weird about men, they never do.
I guarantee you those two won't even think about the consequences of their actions until five minutes before they come home.
So no matter how low I set the bar, he'll still find a way to crawl under it?
You still think there's a bar.
That's so cute.
Look at him, sleeping peacefully while I'm sitting here going through hell.
It's not fair.
God, when did this room get so small?
I hate this.
- Reese, come on, go to sleep.
- I can't.
I just keep thinking about the beating.
How long it'll hurt, how bad it'll be, when it's gonna happen.
What if it's on the Fourth of July?
That'll ruin it.
- I was gonna have pie.
- Dude, you have to calm down.
- We can wait it out.
We can beat this.
- I can't take this anymore.
I'm going out there.
It's probably me he wants, anyway.
- Reese, that's stupid.
There is no logic in that.
- Yes, there is.
He is just getting madder and madder.
And the longer he has to wait, the worse the beating is going to be.
Reese, think about it.
Dewey got beat up even though Randy wasn't after him.
If you go out there now, he'll beat you up even if you're not the one he wants, just to send a message to me.
I don't care anymore.
But if you just wait, I'll figure out a way to get out of this.
I am not gonna wait while you keep trying to come up with some plan that you'll never come up with.
I have to live in the real world.
This mud feels fantastic, doesn't it?
It's so soothing, I don't even care about all the hundreds of people who left their pubes in here.
Come on, Dad.
We should be making the most of this.
You sulked all the way here, you sulked all the way through the cold plunge, you even sulked when they beat us with juniper branches.
Stop being such a baby.
I'm sorry I had such high expectations for this trip.
For all the trouble I went to, I thought maybe I could maybe be an important part of your life.
This has been a nice trip, Dad.
This is exactly how I was hoping it would be.
It just gets to me, Francis.
I mean, how did we get to this point where you're doing all this stuff without me?
I mean, you're-you're traveling everywhere, you're getting married, you're doing all these things without even telling me.
- And now I find out you even went to AA without telling me?
- I can't help it, Dad.
I'm a grown-up now.
It happens.
And I missed it.
I mean, here you've grown into this nice, responsible, decent man, and I didn't get to be there for it.
I missed you being there, too, Dad.
It kind of makes me happy you feel sad about it.
- Well, that's something anyway.
- Yeah.
Five minutes.
Holy crap, we've got to get back home!
Do you realize how much trouble we're in?
Oh, God, you're right.
We're dead.
We can't go back.
No, no, no, no, wait.
I'll think of something.
I've been married for 20 years, and I've gotten out of a lot of trouble.
- Wait, how is it 20 years if I'm 21?
- Just shut up and let me think.
- Okay.
I have something.
- What?
Ow!
God.
What the hell was that for?
You were in a terrible motorcycle accident that taught you a lesson.
Now it's not gonna solve everything, but it's gonna make your apology go down a lot easier because it makes them right, which is what they really want.
- Dad, you're brilliant.
- There's no time for that.
Just do me now.
You're gonna want to grab between the second and third knuckle, and go up and back in one smooth motion.
But just these two so I can still work the throttle.
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you, too, son.
- You were right, Dewey.
I can't tell you how much better I feel.
- Told ya.
It's really freeing.
Especially knowing he still wants the other brother.
Malcolm, you got to go out there.
It's time.
He wants you.
No.
By October, I'll be strong enough to beat him.
Come on, Malcolm.
You have school tomorrow.
You can pretend to be sick for a few days, but sooner or later, Mom gets involved.
- Then what?
- I'll think of something.
Thinking won't do it, Malcolm.
This is not a smart thing.
It's a life thing.
Randy is like an earthquake.
It's just something that's gonna happen.
Seriously, Malcolm, the longer you try to put this off, the worse it's gonna to be.
I could tell he was holding back.
He's got a lot farther he could go.
- This is nothing.
- No, I'm not giving up.
I don't give up.
I'm not a quitter.
If I have a problem, I think and work and keep working on it until I solve it.
Okay, name one time that's ever worked out for you.
Well Did it work five years ago when your hamster died, and you spent so many hours giving it CPR that the doctors had to put a shunt in your mouth to help the sores drain?
Did it work with that girl you kept hounding because you thought she was so close to liking you until she finally maced you?
No, but I could I could Malcolm, think about it.
You're right.
I really have to go out there.
I appreciate you guys looking out for me.
We didn't think you'd be so easy to convince.
No, not him.
Where's the red-haired brother?
- There is no red-haired brother.
This is it.
- Shoot.
I have the wrong house.
Where's that house with the assbag who works with handicapped kids?
Oh, that's Eddie Jeffers.
He lives on Comstock.
You guys got pounded, and I got off scot-free.
Hah!
Now whose philosophy looks stupid?
You thought I couldn't come up with Guys, wait.
What if we do this tomorrow?
You'll be rested.
Take some time first.
We worked so hard and spent so much on Francis' dinner, it's nice that we can all finally enjoy it.
More steak, honey?
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
Mom didn't go shopping.
There's no snacks.
I don't want to watch a movie without snacks.
There's always trail mix.
Yeah.
Trail mix.
-Good movie.
-Yeah.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.17 - Butterflies Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com Usually I spend every minute I'm at Lucky Aide cursing Mom for making me work here, but lately it hasn't seemed so bad.
I'm not sure why.
Malcolm, you were right.
I put a greasy bag in the fridge, and Craig put his name on it.
Yeah, the only way to protect anything is to put it in a nonfat yogurt carton.
That's brilliant.
Wait.
You got something.
Thanks.
She didn't have anything.
So, hey, it turns out I don't have to go with my parents to Yosemite over spring break.
So I guess you'll be in town then, huh?
Looks like it.
You know, me, too.
Maybe we can Malcolm, your break doesn't start for another two minutes.
Wendy, your break is over now.
This is why orphans get all the hot girls.
Oh, God.
I've got graveyard shift for the next two weeks?
I didn't know I had any joy left in my life to be sucked out.
I guess you're going to have to take the bus to work, Malcolm.
You're going to be on your own.
Great.
Figures.
If I can bite through my tongue till my teeth meet maybe Mom won't see me smile.
All right, here's Jamie's schedule for the next two weeks.
-He needs a bath at 6:00, 8:00 and before he goes to bed.
-We talked about Jamie's schedule.
-I want to talk about our schedule.
-We already talked about that schedule.
I know, but I like coming home for lunch to be a special treat, not just for my survival.
Well, I'm not happy about it either, but working graveyard is just part of the job.
Have you told Malcolm you're making him do it with you?
Two days ago.
-What are you so happy about?
-Nothing.
I've just never had the whole bed to myself before.
You stay off my side of the bed!
I don't care if I'm not there.
Okay.
And stop smiling!
Okay.
The only bright spot in all this is that Reese has an even crappier spring break job than I do.
You didn't do too bad today, kid.
Till that possum got up your pant leg, you were way ahead.
So he didn't have rabies, did he?
No.
No, no, no, no.
He checked out fine.
Say, uh, you going to be able to sit up soon 'cause we're almost at your house.
These fumes are kind of strong.
Can I get one of those paper masks next time?
Do I look like I'm made of money?
You got a different kind of a job tomorrow.
What's this?
That's a thousand caterpillars.
Tomorrow morning, get up before dawn, I want you to go around the neighborhood, sprinkle those on the rose bushes, flower beds, front lawns And then I want you to take my business card and drop it in the mailbox, you understand?
Why do you sound very far away?
Don't go to sleep for a while.
It sucks you have to work the night shift.
Now you're going to miss the party.
Debbie's parents are out of town.
Probably won't miss much.
It's just the same boring people doing the same boring stuff.
Whoa, I gotta run.
Skinny-dipping starts at midnight.
Hey, Malcolm.
At what age do you just accept that your life is a piece of rotten garbage and always will be?
Twenty-two.
But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the heck out of every moment.
Take tonight.
You're in for a real treat.
There's a different rhythm to the night shift.
It's a camaraderie, a brotherhood of kindred souls, a nocturnal fraternity of the prowlers of the inky netherworld.
-Hello, fellow traveler.
-Where's the toothpaste?
-I'm on a break.
Make sure all the pens are cap-side up with the pocket clips facing forward.
This is the benefit of graveyard shift.
You don't have all that chaos that goes on during the daytime.
You can get things organized the way they're meant to be.
You're just trying to torture me.
That's why I'm here, just admit it.
You're here because you need the money.
-I give you three-quarters of my paycheck.
-That's why you need the money.
That's weird.
Did you see anyone?
What?
Someone left a candy wrapper and change on the counter here, but nobody's been in the store for hours.
It was probably a mouse.
A mouse that left the exact change?
I played tic-tac-toe with a chicken at the county fair, and it beat me eight times in a row.
Don't shortchange animals.
I didn't see anyone though.
Nevermind.
Wait, aren't you even curious how that happened?
Malcolm, everything doesn't have to be fascinating.
Now it looks like the guy in the hockey mask is dead, right?
But just keep your eye on that coffin.
Hold on.
Why aren't you at work?
I don't want to hear that you're too good to crawl under houses poisoning rats all day.
There are ten guys with MBA's who would love to have that job.
I didn't quit.
I showed up this morning and the cops were there.
It turns out Mr. Krijak was renting out his gas tanks for parties.
Now I have to dump this stupid box of caterpillars for free!
Have a nice death, puss-bags.
Hey!
Get off of me.
Oh, a tough guy, huh?
Hey Cut it out, that tickles.
Craig, did you do this?
Do what?
Those vitamins that were recalled.
Did you clear off this shelf?
Doesn't sound like me.
Six coats of wax, and I buttered up my socks.
The record's going down.
You know, things have been getting really weird around here.
I mean, think about it.
Last night, all the clocks in the display case were synchronized to the same time.
And the night before that, all the fingerprints were cleaned off the freezer doors.
Malcolm, I think you're forgetting the graveyard shift motto "Who cares"?
It doesn't matter if no one else knows.
You know.
Okay, Dewey gets the pancakes and eggs.
And Lois has the veal parmesan.
Oh, look at you, Jamie.
You have changed so much in just a week.
Your head's almost symmetrical.
Better eat up don't you need to be in bed before I go to work?
Honey, I'm spending sometime with my son who I've barely seen in the last week.
You've got 18 years for that.
I'm only asking for ten minutes.
Wow, another great night's sleep.
No fighting for blankets, no elbows in my face, or anything worse.
Just all the room in the world.
Don't freak out when you get into your side of the bed.
It looks bad, but most of it's only a Moon Pie.
Did you know the Latin name for this little guy is Danaus plexippus, and that he actually crawls out of his own skin to pupate?
Then the outer layer hardens into the chrysalis.
That's Greek for "golden".
And once they turn into butterflies, they can migrate up to 2,000 miles.
Pretty awesome, huh?
Oh, got to feed them some more milkweed.
Wow.
That's the first time I've ever seen Reese take a concerned interest in another living thing.
It's kind of nice to know he's got a compassionate side.
I want those revolting bugs in the trash by tomorrow morning.
Craig.
Take a look at this.
If you don't mind, I'm trying to get in a quick nap before my break.
Seriously.
Check out this guy.
He's here, and then two hours later he's still there, only in a different outfit.
And three hours later, he shows up again in another outfit.
Whoa!
Did you see that?
!
Malcolm, please.
If I don't get my 16 hours, I'm a bear.
What are doing in there?
Shopping.
You're not shopping.
You're the guy from the videotape.
You're living here?
Malcolm, please.
Your mom's going to hear us.
How do you know my name?
How do you know my mom?
I've been here for a while.
And you were right about moving the tortilla chips to the salsa aisle.
The sales are up at least 15%.
I knew it.
Wait.
How long's "a while"?
Three years in January.
I was going to move over to foot care, but once you get unpacked, it's You've been living in this store for three years?
Are you crazy?
I don't know.
I just Malcolm, I had this super high-pressure job.
People were constantly hounding me for answers, decisions, budgets, signatures.
My-My nerves were a total wreck.
I was wandering around here waiting for my Xanax refill, my-my cell phone and BlackBerry both going off, and I saw this crack.
And I decided to hide in there, just for a few minutes, and it was fantastic.
I didn't want to leave.
And then I didn't, and no one noticed, so I just stayed.
You never left the store in all that time?
You guys are pretty well-stocked here.
Lots of canned goods, toiletries Every day I clean a different third of my body in the bathroom sink.
-But you can't just live here.
-Why not?
I-I pay for everything I use, I help out whenever I can.
I clean spills, I change light bulbs.
I have saved Craig's life at least five times.
You're not going to tell on me, are you?
I don't know What about Wendy?
I know you like her.
And I can help you.
I see her all the time.
I overhear her conversations.
I know everything about her, like why she broke up with her last boyfriend.
-Why?
-Will you let me stay?
Yeah, all right.
Okay, so I'm entrusting my love life to a burned-out hermit who lives behind a ball cage.
That doesn't make me a desperate loser.
I'm doing it anyway.
-Okay, Reese -Shh.
Dad, they're pupating.
They need peace and quiet while they're developing their delicate new We got to dump the bugs.
What?
!
Sorry.
Your mother wants them gone.
No, you can't do this.
They never hurt anyone.
They have no protection, no one to watch over them.
Oh, crap, I'm too late.
You bonded with them, didn't you?
Well, welcome to my world.
Now you're stuck with feelings of unjustified love for a bunch of mindless, ungrateful eating machines.
See how you like it.
At least yours will be dead in a month.
Then I can keep them?
Throw them under the tarp with the Playboys.
And you better be a sullen jerk to me in front of your mother so she doesn't get wise.
You got that?
-Go on.
-Okay.
I overheard her on the phone saying she's sick of guys who play games.
She says she just wants someone who's honest and straightforward.
That's great.
I'm totally honest and straightforward.
Actually, you're more like blunt and aggressive.
That's okay.
You just got to slow down, give yourself a chance.
She spent 22 minutes and 18 seconds looking through Hallmark cards.
She needs to be treated gently.
Here's some stuff she likes.
Movies, music, shampoo brands, paper towels Uh, well, some of it's more useful than others, but learn it all.
When the time's right, you can show her how much you have in common with her.
Thanks.
This is great.
Who are you talking to?
Um, I was just singing.
Thanks, this is great, As long as we're together, girl.
Yeah.
In my car.
I want you to know something.
I've been sleeping in that bed by myself for a week.
A week without sharing covers, a week without being smashed, and a week without having anyone's butt shoved into my face.
So, what are you angry about?
Because during the last week, I've grown half an inch.
You lied to me.
I'm not the smallest kid in my class from my genetics.
It's because I've been stuffed into a bed with Malcolm all my life.
Whoo, you don't know that.
It could be all the crap we feed you, or the chemical plant near the park.
-Dad -Dewey, I'm sorry.
But we can't afford to buy you your own bed.
You'll just have to grow after Malcolm goes off to college.
Oh, no, then Jamie's going into it.
Well, at least you'll always be bigger than he is.
Yesterday, I passed Wendy at the time clock and casually mentioned how I liked the smell of bookstores.
She was so charmed, I didn't even care how stupid that is.
All right, what's going on?
What are you talking about?
You haven't complained about one thing in the last week.
The only time you don't complain is when you're hiding something from me.
I'm not hiding anything from you.
Malcolm.
There you are.
Remember last week when you were trying to figure out how that spill got cleaned up?
No.
But remember those vitamins getting pulled from the shelf, and the ice cream case getting cleaned, and those socks being left out to dry and all those other things that seemed like they were happening by themselves?
Not now, Craig.
I figured it out.
I know what's going on.
The store is haunted.
Craig -All right, what's in this bag?
-Nothing.
I'm restocking.
Fresh fruit?
A package of all-cotton underwear?
A decent book?
We don't sell this stuff.
Okay, fine.
If you must know, I was restocking my locker.
I've been having intense stomach problems, and that's what the fruit is for, and the underwear, and sadly, the book, too.
And now that you've publicly humiliated me, can I go about my business?
Okay, not bad.
It's plausible, embarrassing enough for the outburst, and essentially unprovable.
I just have to stand my ground.
Attention Lucky Aide trespasser.
You do not get to do this.
You do not get to live off the grid.
If anyone on the planet was entitled to hide from all the aggravation, it would be me, but I don't, do you understand?
No one gets to shirk their share of the misery.
Everyone has to be stuck in this together.
That's what's fair.
Those are the rules.
Now, you obviously know me, so you know what I'm willing to do to find you.
So save us both the time and come out now.
Let me handle this.
Do you know anything about a guy living in the store?
No!
No, Reese, you're not coming in here with those.
But they'll freeze to death out there!
I'm sorry, son.
I already promised your mom I would get rid of them.
And I have four or five other lies in the fire I can't jeopardize.
The bugs stay outside.
Fine.
Then I'll I'll I'll fight you for it.
Reese, you already fought me for the last English muffin two weeks ago, and I cleaned your clock.
But this time, I'm fighting for something I love even more than those muffins.
Keep your voice down.
You're going to wake Jamie.
Good.
I want him to hear what kind of heartless monster his father really is.
Come on, old man, let's go.
All right.
But if I throw my back out again beating you up, I am going to kick the crap out of you.
Well, the police are on their way.
Three years you've been living here.
Unbelievable.
Didn't you once give me the Heimlich maneuver in Snacks and Nuts?
You've got to learn to chew.
Easier said, my friend.
Mom, can't you just let him go?
He didn't even really do anything wrong.
He paid for everything he took.
He helped out around the store.
The guy's just living here.
What's wrong with that?
I could just disappear, go to the Wal-Mart down the block.
I've heard great things about them.
He broke the rules, Malcolm.
The rules matter.
Rules say we get paid time and a half for the graveyard shift.
The rules say trespassers are dealt with by the police.
You can't just pick and choose what rules you want to follow, or the whole system breaks down.
-But -Malcolm, I'm sorry.
But as long as I'm working here, I can't bend the rules for anyone.
What are you doing?
I'm off the clock.
I'm going home.
Everybody else can do whatever they want.
But they better do it quick.
They don't have a lot of time.
-Thank you.
-For what?
Great.
She lets that guy walk, but makes a federal case whenever I put my phone number in with the birth control pills.
-Hi, Malcolm.
-Oh, hey, Wendy.
Did you get the blue irises I sent you?
Yeah, I did.
How did you know those were my favorite flowers?
Well, you know, I guess we just really have a lot in common.
Like loving grilled cheese and tomato sandwiches and Stephen King books.
I wouldn't be surprised if you were a big Coldplay fan, too.
What the hell are you doing?
Following me around?
Are you stalking me?
No.
No, no.
I guess we're just really in sync.
-Is that so weird?
I mean, sometimes two people -You stay away from me, creep.
Don't worry, buddy.
Even I get that sometimes.
Dad, the toilet lid was up, and Jamie's tongue is blue again.
Did you spend all night out there?
My choice.
It's very bracing out there.
Now why don't you help me into the shower and see if we can't save your dad's toes.
Oh, my God.
Winston, is that you?
Geez.
I thought you were going to look totally gay as a butterfly, but you look amazing.
Harv?
And Julio.
I knew you'd be one of the first.
You were always the head of the class.
This is fantastic.
Look at all of you guys.
Wow.
I forgot how many of you there were.
Okay.
That's a lot of fluttering.
That's enough.
Get off of me.
Get the hell off of me!
Help!
Help!
Good news.
Wendy's restraining order has been reduced from 100 feet to 50 feet.
If I can yell loud enough, I think I can straighten this out.
It's so good to have you back.
-Oh.
You coming home for lunch?
-Mm, and coffee break.
No, no!
Okay, one more week, then that joke's off limits.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
NOTICE OF SUSPENSION Here you go, Jamie.
What are you doing?
Mom's been going through the trash.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.18 - Ida's Dance Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com Check it out.
This is my homework.
I've spent every night this year cramming my skull full of integral calculus and conversational Latin.
I just needed one class that wasn't going to kill me.
And then I saw it Music Appreciation.
It's an actual class.
All I have to do is listen to a CD and write down how it makes me feel.
It's such an easy "A".
No matter how easy an "A" is, a "D" is always easier, Malcolm.
Not in this class.
I better get started on my homework.
"F"!
I can't believe that goateed moron gave me an "F".
"You obviously didn't even listen to the piece".
I listened to it.
You saw me.
You know, with the right kind of pen, you can turn that "F" into a "P".
Mom?
Finally!
Where have you been?
I've been calling for weeks.
I must have left ten messages.
What on Earth is going on up there?
I'm busy.
Gorga, Ludwina and Marica need me to help make pickles for the festival.
Mom, what are you talking about?
Gorga?
Marica?
Marica's Ludwina's cousin.
She married the sailor with the milky eye.
And she knows the curse to give you warts.
-You're not making any sense.
-I have to go.
They're calling me.
Oh, my God, Hal.
She's lost her mind.
She thinks she's back in her old village.
I have to go up there.
Why?
Hal, she has one leg, she's demented.
She could wander out onto a freeway.
I thought we agreed we'd take no extraordinary measures to prolong her life.
Fine.
There we go.
If Mommy asks, you got a bath.
-Did you get it?
-Oh, yeah.
Exhumed Maniac.
The guy at the video store said it even creeped him out, and he's an albino.
Oh, I love scary movies.
There's nothing so primal as a man coming face-to-face with what really terrifies him.
We'll keep this a secret from your mother.
Got it.
There's commercials she won't let me watch.
Well, she's gone for five days, we can have a film festival.
Now, the thing about horror films is that it's always what they don't show that's scary, because nothing on the screen can ever be as truly frightening as what we imagin I'm glad they shoved that guy's skin down his throat.
I didn't think he'd ever stop screaming.
I have a favor to ask.
I'm taking Music Appreciation, but I'm not doing so well.
I have to get an "A" in this class.
I know you know about this stuff, so I'm willing to pay you ten bucks an hour to teach me until I get it right, okay?
"The Adagio for Organ and Strings" makes you happy?
Are you going to help me or not?
So let me get this straight.
You, the brilliant genius Malcolm, are coming to me, your little brother, for help on your homework?
Yes, Dewey, that's right.
So you're a total idiot at music?
Yes, Dewey, it seems that way.
That's probably why you're such a drag to be around.
Yes, Dewey, that's probably why I'm such a drag to be around.
Interesting.
And that must be why you're hitting yourself.
Is this gonna take long?
Depends how fast you obey.
And that must be why you're hitting yourself.
Mom.
Oh, thank God you're all right.
What are you doing here?
Mrs. Kucheck next door told me you were down here.
She also said to stop stealing her newspaper.
I told her she's free to fight me for it.
You didn't return my calls for two weeks.
-I was worried.
-Oh, yes, so worried.
You get the earrings, Susan gets the bracelet.
Now go home.
Mother -What is this place?
-It's wonderful.
It's like being back in the village.
Everyone here is from the old country.
They got the right kind of pickles.
They know the old songs.
After country, I finally feel like I fit in.
Wow, I felt surrounded when there was just one of you.
You going to introduce her to us or make us wait around like a pack of pigs?
Pack of pigs wouldn't leave their nail clippings on the floor for other people to step on.
This is my daughter, Lois.
Gorga.
Ludwina.
Big Kathy.
Little Kathy.
Marica.
Floransa.
Anca.
And Mushka.
Is this the fat daughter or the one who drinks?
This is the one with the half-wit factory between her legs.
Well, I don't know what to say.
I planned on two days to get you into an old folks home, two days to fight the court challenge, then I'd fly back on Sunday.
Now I'm stuck here it's $300 just to change my ticket.
Good.
You'll be here for the festival Saturday.
What festival?
You stop it.
You know it's Saint Grotus's Day.
Oh, my God.
Saint Grotus's Day?
That's still around?
It is.
And we haven't turned our church into a Burger King either.
She's being modest.
She was a terrific Grotus Day dancer.
Made your children look like poisoned sheep.
Best girl between the vlatnis in 15 counties!
Not the vlatnis.
God, I hated that awful vlatny dance.
You loved it.
She begged to go.
She dragged me seven blocks by my pigtails to some stinking butcher shop full of drunk uncles.
I couldn't even see my feet through the flies and the cigarette smoke.
When I was 16, I worked up the nerve to tell her I wanted to quit.
She fed me nothing but bark for a week.
It's her stupid idea of a joke.
You're not around fancy big-shots with all their teeth, sipping wine.
These are real people.
You will not embarrass me in front of my friends by spitting on who you are and where you come from.
Fine.
Oh.
Boshnik bread.
I haven't had this in years.
Does it work or just cram its face with bread?
She works.
And not on her back like your slut daughter.
Can she make a Saint Grotus's Day tart?
I'd have left her in the forest with her hand nailed to a stump if she didn't.
You will make the tart this year.
The tart?
By myself?
That thing is gigantic.
Yes, let Ida's daughter rest.
The old ladies with arthritis can make the Saint his tart.
Ida's daughter can sit on her gigantic ass all day and eat bread.
Jelly, dear?
Fine.
I'm here for five days.
I was expecting to be miserable anyway.
I'll make the tart.
We got it started for you.
No!
Not my eyes!
Not my baby's eyes, too!
Hey, Dad.
What do you want?
!
I wanted to trade my Fruit Roll-Up for a strawberry one?
Sorry, son.
Of course you can.
But ask for it like a man.
Don't go creeping around the kitchen.
I'll just come back later.
You seem busy.
Hey, Dad.
Check out tonight's movie.
They Peeled My Face.
The director went to jail for using real corpses.
Listen, Reese, I wanted to talk about movie night.
Really?
I wasn't going to say anything 'cause it's so gay to talk about feelings, but I used to feel bad that we don't spend any time together.
And now I find out that the one thing I like the most, that everyone else thinks is creepy, my dad likes it, too.
-How great is that?
-Really great.
Does it have to be so hot?
It's, like, 95 degrees in here.
Yes, we'll turn on the air-conditioning and let the tart collapse so you can live like a movie star.
-Let's see how you did.
-No, it's not done yet.
I was nine hours into it when you made me start over because the almonds weren't facing Vadutz.
You made vomit.
The Saint killed our enemies, then went to hell to ask Jesus to increase the severity of their punishment, and you reward him with vomit?
You might as well wipe yourself with the beard of the Most Holy Patriarch.
Why is my tart vomit?
Stop your temper tantrum!
Look here.
The 15th layer you put apricots.
Is that correct?
The Saint didn't slaughter the peacemakers on the 15th.
He waited till the 16th when they trusted him.
This thing has, like, 35 layers.
Who's gonna know where the apricots are?
So if you steal and no one knows, that makes it okay?
I taught her better than that, till my arm was going to fall off.
She has to start over.
What?
This is ridiculous.
Don't blame yourself, Ida.
She was born rotten.
That's why the goat refused to breast-feed her.
Can I at least have a rag to tie around my head to keep the sweat out of my eyes?
Yes, Your Majesty.
We have to start from the very begining.
What do you feel ?
I don't feel anything.
It's just dinging, and it's annoying.
What the hell is wrong with you?
Babies understand this music.
I'll tell you what's wrong with me.
You're teaching me bad on purpose.
Great.
Now you're stupid and crazy.
Am I?
I asked to learn the one thing that makes you special, your stupid music, but you can't stand that, can you?
You've been sabotaging me from day one.
That's it.
I quit.
You can't.
-You made a promise.
-I did not.
We tried everything and you're an idiot.
You are not walking away from this, Dewey.
You're going to help me beat this.
I don't care.
Fail your course.
I dropped that class last week.
Then why are you bothering me?
Because you know music and I don't and that's not fair.
It's totally fair.
You just hate that you don't get to be better than everybody at everything all the time.
Music's my only thing.
And you know what?
It's greater than everything you have put together, because it's about beauty and love and feeling, and not about proving what a creepy little genius you are to everybody, so excuse me.
I'm going to appreciate music.
It's all the sweeter because I know you can't.
Oh, my God.
Dewey.
Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
I'm deaf.
I'm deaf.
Oh, my God.
-Mom's gonna kill us!
-Shut up.
Calm down.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
Your hearing will probably come back in a while.
Please, just don't say anything, okay?
Let's just keep this quiet for a while.
Do you understand?
Does a punch mean yes?
Good.
Well, I finished.
I almost gave up when I thought I burned the prunes.
But then I fell into this rhythm, and I just lost track of time.
The next thing you know, it's done.
And it came out perfect.
It was a lot of work, but you know something?
It feels good.
What's that?
That's the real tart.
You kept screwing up.
We just knew it would be easier for everyone if we just made it ourselves.
But I worked for days!
I'm sorry.
I know you'd rather be at the disco shaking your backside at a bunch of drug addicts.
You like St. Grotus's Day?
!
Huh?
!
You like tarts?
!
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's celebrate!
Well, maybe next time you'll think better before criticizing other people's desserts.
What are you doing?
Oh, Malcolm.
I didn't hear you.
I wonder why.
Why don't you have a seat?
Now I know some people say an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
But I think it's simple fairness.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Just say what you mean.
You seem confused.
You want me to help you?
Well, let's see if I can make it loud and clear.
I can't do it.
I guess I'm just a better person than you are.
You know, there's some diabetes medicine in the fridge you may want to destroy.
I am not going to be the bad guy in this, Mother.
I just want to understand my daughter's behavior.
Why are you so frustrated?
Is your husband failing to perform his shameful duty?
Mother, just shut up, and leave me alone.
After all the Saint did for us, all the enemy churches he burned, why would you destroy his holy cookie?
It doesn't even taste good.
It's not supposed to taste good.
It's supposed to be hard to make.
I can't believe you would humiliate me in front of my friends!
F riends?
Those women are monsters.
They treat me like garbage.
How can they be your friends?
I need some people I can talk to, Lois!
Well, you used to need me!
I'm going.
All right.
So now we're both deaf, but that's okay.
We've had a while to practice now and we're pretty confident we can hide it from Dad!
Boys, listen, I'm going to grab the TV and hide it till your mother gets back.
I'm going to tell Reese that it was stolen by junkies, desperate for a quick fix.
If he ever suspects, you didn't hear it from me.
Oh!
Hey, Dad.
The guy at the video store finally admitted they have a secret room behind the snuff films.
I'm going to go check it out.
Sounds like a plan.
Boys give me a hand here.
Boys, help!
Boys!
Help me!
For God sakes, what's wrong with you?
!
Save your father's eyes!
This makes up for everything.
Is that supposed to impress me?
Mother, I swear to God I almost quit twice between the first and the second corset.
-I'm this close to -All right.
You want to dance we dance.
What are you doing?
I'm not dancing in this thing.
It just gets in the way.
Begin we now the wushny sabor!
The dance where mistakes are long remembered.
More drinking!
Noroc!
Noroc, Mother.
Noroc.
The lato vlatnis.
Hard as a Cossack's heart.
Sharp as a raven's beak.
Oh, crap.
I hate the knives.
You think your dad getting killed by a TV set is funny?
!
I'll tell you what's funny!
Being grounded for the rest of your lives!
After about an hour, he managed to spit a piece of glass into my lap.
You got to admire that kind of perseverance.
Your children and your children's children will grow up grounded in this house!
I can't hear what he's saying.
But judging by the color of his face, I probably shouldn't ask for the car this weekend.
Dad, come on.
I've got something to show you.
We'll use this system until Mom comes home, then say it was defective, and get a refund.
Tonight's going to feel like we're actually inside the guy's torso.
Son, sit down.
Listen These movies are torture for me.
I chewed blisters into my fingers, I can't sleep, I'm afraid of everything.
But I love you, and I love spending time with you.
Oh.
Like me and baseball.
What?
Like when you were so excited to teach me baseball when I was six, and I couldn't tell you how totally boring it is.
But that look on your face when I got you your first mitt?
It's the same face I use when I get underwear for Christmas.
"Wow, it's like you read my mind"!
It's not so bad.
We're both just liars for a good cause.
Yeah.
Like that stupid camping trip.
I loved that camping trip.
That's what I meant.
Hi, Dewey.
Mom.
Your voice.
Your beautiful voice.
I can hear you.
Well, it's nice to see you too, honey.
Every morning those damn birds.
They can't keep Wait.
I can hear.
I can hear.
Oh, my God, I'm so happy.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Monkey!
Squid!
Kangaroo!
I have no idea if a monkey could beat a squid or a kangaroo in a knife fight, but if I admitted that, we'd have nothing to do for the rest of the day.
Monkey!
Malcolm in the Middle Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com A motivation seminar.
For the whole weekend!
Can you believe this?
Like I need motivation.
And they just told you about it today?
They claim it was in some "memo" they sent me three months ago.
So now, suddenly my job includes weekend seminars and memo-reading.
Can they really force you to go?
Lois, they can make you do anything.
Once you sign up for a job in this country, you give away the whole kit and kaboodle.
Our weekends, our house, our kids we don't own any of it.
Okay, everybody, dinner.
This is all just an exercise to remind the little man who's boss.
They're just trying to motivate me to keep me in my place to kill any dreams I might have of ever digging my way out Oh, my God, it starts at 9:00?
Sorry.
I forgot how late it was.
Why are your fingernails clean?
Did you clean your fingernails?
I thought I'd try it, and it turns out I like it.
It makes me feel good about myself.
Well, that's enough of that.
It's time for dinner.
Damn.
Pack of dogs is in the garbage again.
Go away.
Scat.
You know why they like our trash is Jamie's dirty diapers.
If he digested his food a little better, there wouldn't be so much for them to eat in there.
Filthy, disgusting animals.
You know, Mom, if you double-bagged the trash, the dogs might not be able to smell it.
Uh-oh.
Reese just made the classic mistake of expressing an interest in something that Mom said.
All right, Reese, since you're so full of good ideas, why don't you be in charge of cleaning up the garbage from now on.
If he just shuts up now, it might not get any worse.
I don't see why it matters if some dogs dump a little garbage on our lawn.
The backyard's a mess already.
Oh, this is hard to watch.
Hey, get lost.
Get out of here.
You come back to laugh at me?
You think you're so smart?
I am a human being.
I am probably smarter than the smartest dog that's ever lived.
Now shoo.
Shoo.
I've got a gun!
You make one step, and you're all getting it.
Go away!
Hey, that's mine!
Give it back!
Reese, where have you been all night?
I started chasing these dogs, and it turned out they were really cool.
So we went to the park, and then we found a tennis ball.
And I took it from Toffe, and then Toffe took it from me and gave it to Rusty.
And then we drank some water.
And then we turned over some trash cans.
Then Lucky did this hilarious thing where he rubs his butt on the ground.
I can't do it.
So then we chased this cat that was all like, "Aw"!
Stupid cat.
Then we stopped at the 7-Eleven, and I went inside and had a Coke while they had some burritos out of the Dumpster.
Spike ate his twice.
Wait a minute.
You spent the night in a dog pack?
Yeah.
So then there were these squirrels who were like, "We're up in a tree, you'll never get us".
You're talking about them like they're friends.
They're just animals.
Well, I'm sorry that we're not like your friends, sitting around all intellectual, discussing multiplication.
You can't get into bed like that.
You stink.
Hey, I got checked out pretty thoroughly in that department, and I didn't hear any complaints.
Every one of you is here because you're successful.
Successful at letting yourself down.
Nobody's better at settling, making excuses, shortchanging yourself and those who count on you.
Congratulations.
You all got here the exact same way: one step at a time.
Postpone that dream.
Reduce that goal.
It's just another year.
It's just another cookie Now you tell yourself it's good enough.
It's not good enough!
You think you can't help it, but you can.
I'm going to tear away the nonsense, the dime store philosophies, the catchphrases and bring out your inner Viking.
Scott Porter.
It says here you'd rather not talk about your recent divorce.
Sorry I missed lunch.
I was at the library, and I forgot to look at the clock Do you think I'm a idiot?
Huh?
Do you think I don't know where you've been?
What do you mean?
Did you think I wouldn't recognize the signs?
The clean fingernails, good posture, the cookie crumbs in your pockets.
You're never hungry at dinnertime.
You're seeing another mom.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Don't lie to me!
It's not what you think.
Who is she?
-Why does that matter?
-Who is she?
!
Mrs. Finnegan.
It doesn't mean anything.
A couple of weeks ago I stopped by her house, and she had her iron out.
She was just so nice, and there was cake.
Well, it'll be a long time before you get any cake around here.
I wasn't expecting any.
After everything I've sacrificed for you, all I've done you come waltzing in here day after day, reeking of her fabric softener.
Yes.
I like fabric softener.
Mrs. Finnegan doesn't mind taking a little time to stop the rinse cycle.
And maybe it's nice to have someone who's got more to say to me than just, "Clean your room," "Comb your hair" Do you love her?
Of course not.
It's just snacks.
Oh, you like her snacks?
You like filling up on her cookies?
You know they're store-bought.
That's beneath you, Mom.
Doesn't feel good, does it?
Well, you're not here to feel good.
You're here to face the lies you tell yourself.
You can stop.
I think I'm at bottom now.
You're not at bottom.
I'll tell you when you're at bottom.
You think you're fooling anybody with those vertical stripes?
What are you, You might as well be a thousand pounds overweight.
Is anyone in this room attracted to her?
Do you want to know what you have to do, Angela?
Hello.
Aw, geez, really?
I got to go.
Hey, shouldn't somebody?
Angela?
What do I do?
!
Hey come on you know Yes.
You're right.
I do know.
Of course I know.
Thank you!
Can you do me?
Oh, who am I kidding?
Guys, I need a night off.
I've been out with you I very night this week.
They really want me to come.
Reese, this is crazy.
What could you possibly be getting out of this?
You don't know how good it feels.
You know where you stand with these guys.
I've got Toffe and Jonesy under me, but I'm under Duke, Chewy and Spike.
Scout tried to cross the highway yesterday, so I moved up.
And Lucky's totally the boss.
There's no phonies.
You know what a growl means, you know what a lick means.
You're kidding yourself.
You're not one of them.
You're just jealous 'cause I'm popular.
Morning.
Hi, honey.
How was the seminar?
Unbe-freaking-lievable.
I haven't slept in 48 hours.
The Viking guy had to leave suddenly, so I stepped in, and I started talking to people about their lives.
And honey, I got to tell you, I have wisdom.
Nobody was more surprised than me, but I did so well they have me leading motivational seminars for the next eight weekends.
Wow.
This is the beginning of something, Lois.
The bosses are seeing me in a whole new light.
Did they cross you off the probation list?
In ink.
Morning, son.
Hi, Dad.
Thanks, Mom.
I called Mrs. Finnegan.
You what?
She knows I know.
You're never seeing her again.
I can't believe you told her we had an understanding.
Morning.
Reese, I need you to put your dirty clothes in the hamper before you leave this morning.
I already did it, Mom.
You did?
Why?
I feel bad I haven't always pulled my weight around here.
I mean, you're the leader.
It's my place to respect you.
Well thank you, Reese.
Hey.
Good morning, Malcolm.
There's money on the counter for your yearbook.
I don't want to buy a yearbook.
I don't want anything that will remind me I ever went to that stupid school.
how can you say that?
Being part of a group is important.
Don't you care about loyalty?
I think loyalty is the most important thing there is.
Well, I'm glad at least one of my sons knows something about that.
Hey!
What are you doing here?
!
This isn't your house!
You don't live here!
We live here!
This is our house!
What do you want?
!
Huh?
!
What?
!
What?
!
What?
!
What?
!
What?
!
What?
!
What?
!
What?
!
You'll have to climb the ladder of achievement one rung at a time.
You'll never reach the top if you don't start climbing.
And when you reach the top, you realize that the journey never ends.
Excuse me.
If you're at the top, how come the journey doesn't end?
Because at the top of the ladder, there's a car.
The question is, will you be driving?
Or just a passenger?
Whenever you let somebody else drive, he might have errands to do.
Where do you think he might stop?
The dry cleaners?
Very good.
Where else?
Drugstore?
Yes!
Where else?
Tim?
There's a place you can go to have your shoes treated so they won't develop a smell over time.
Excellent!
Okay, now what does all this mean?
It means nothing.
It means nothing!
This is what happens when you let somebody else drive the car.
You've all got to be the drivers of your own car.
And what do you do if the gas gauge says your tank is empty?
Stop at a gas station?
No!
You keep driving!
You don't let anything stop you.
Let me hear some "Vroom".
You know!
Excuse me, Hal.
I need to have bathroom break.
Need or want?
I'd say need, Hal.
I really have to go to the bathroom.
-I need to go.
-Me, too.
So this is something none of us feel we can overcome?
This has us beat.
Well, then, we can put our work here aside and all go to the bathroom.
Only there's no bathroom in the car!
Hey, Mom.
Here's your lunch.
Mm.
Meatloaf Sandwich.
Oh, morning, dear.
Oh, honey, it feels so good to be helping people take control of their lives.
Milton in Accounting called me from the Motel 6 this morning.
He had to leave his wife and kids, but as soon as the Ice Capades reads his script, he's moving the whole family to New York.
What are you doing?
Oh, I keep trying and trying to get Jamie to use the potty, but he keeps refusing.
Those stupid parenting books say to put stickers all over it, make it a happy place, so I figured why not?
I obviously don't know anything about raising children.
Damn it!
What's wrong with these boys?
Honey, let me handle this.
You are a superstar!
You're not afraid of this potty!
This potty is afraid of you!
You have to visualize your success!
Now, let's look at the five lies you tell yourself that prevent you from being all that you can be!
Oh, Hal!
Reese, where have you been?
Why weren't you in school today?
A pack from another neighborhood was sniffing around, trying to move into our territory.
Me and the boys had a score to settle.
You were out fighting with dogs?
What is wrong with you?
Is that a bite mark on your leg?
This little crazy guy went after Toffee, Oh, man!
And then Chewy and Angel went down!
So we brought down a couple of theirs!
Tit for tat, baby!
Oh, we're gonna settle this thing no matter what it costs!
It's gonna go on and on until the bitter end!
They need me.
$120, $140, $160, $180.
That'll have to do.
I'm giving you a good deal, kid.
I didn't get in this business so I could rip off little children.
Hey, you need a gun?
Let's hear from some more who aren't afraid!
I'm gonna be a vice president in two years!
Hey, come on, he knows!
I'm gonna get out of debt!
Hey, she knows!
I'm gonna have sex with a member of every race!
All right!
All right!
Now let's see who's next up.
Gerry?
Is there a Gerry Morrison in the house?
Oh, Gerry, it says here that you turned down a promotion four times.
Lady Luck smiles, but you give her the old stink eye.
Gerry, what's going on?
I guess I'm just frightened.
I mean, I'm good at what I do now, and if I start trying to move up the ladder, I'll probably let everyone else down.
Gerry, did you know that Michael Jordan didn't even see a basketball until he was 30 years old?
No, no.
I didn't know that.
Who tied your tie this morning, Gerry?
I did.
Somebody just came in, pulled up your pants, shaved your face, combed back that lovely head of hair?
No.
I did it all myself.
You did it all by yourself.
You were in charge this morning, Gerry.
But somehow when you walked out that door, you let the world take over.
Why did you do that?
I don't know.
Well, I do know, Gerry.
It's because you denied the giant that's inside you.
You two.
Get down on your hands and knees.
I actually have a bad back.
Is that your back talking, or your mind?
-Actually, it's my doctor.
-Or your doctor's mind?
You tell your back it takes orders from you now.
Climb on top, Gerry.
What?
Climb on top like the giant you are.
Okay.
I think my back is A bridge of steel!
How does it feel, Giant Gerry?
Tall.
Damn tall!
All your life you've been letting people call the shots for you.
Well, no more!
Today is the day.
You're a giant, Giant Gerry!
The world looks better from up here.
You bet it does!
And that's where you live now.
So what are you going to do, Giant Gerry?
I'm gonna take that promotion!
And I'm gonna become head of Systems Management!
I-I'm in Systems Management.
Damn right you are!
And I'm gonna take you off these seminars and I'm gonna put you on my team full time.
I'm gonna work that department, and I'm gonna work it until it's the strongest one in the whole company!
And I'm gonna push my workers until they've given me everything that they've got.
And then they can all say good-bye to their families 'cause I'm driving straight to the top!
Man, that was amazing!
They won't be leaving any more messages on our side of the park!
Where we going now, Lucky, huh?
Lucky, where you leading us?
Really?
You guys mean it?
All right, I won't let you guys down.
Let's roll!
You found him in a chicken coop?
!
It's hard to know exactly what happened, ma'am.
He and his friends appeared to have had themselves quite a little party.
They just don't train ya to handle a scene like that.
The law's a little murky in this area, but when we figure out how to charge him I'll be back.
I never thought about how it would end.
It just felt so cool to belong.
The important thing is you're out.
But my boys They rounded us all up and then these vets came in, and one by one They killed them?
No.
But they're not my boys anymore.
Mom Dewey.
I want to talk.
I really don't feel up to that right now.
I know I hurt you and I'm very sorry.
Thank you, Dewey.
But words are cheap.
I wanted to do something that would show you I'm committed to this relationship.
I want you to know how much you mean to me.
I want you to know that no one can take your place.
LOIS IS MY MOTHER I'm going back Tuesday.
I passed out before they colored in the drop-shadow.
It's not that I don't appreciate We are going down to the hospital and you're gonna have that lasered off right this Okay, I know you're trying to But what is wrong with?
I never imagined you'd be willing to But that is so stupid!
Oh, look, they made a heart!
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Two kids down, three to go.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.20 - Stilts Forom.com, Life-is-Unfair.
tk & Malcolm-France.com So, there I was innocently paying the bills, when I was suddenly slapped in the face by a charge for $45.
It took me almost an hour to sniff out your little rathole behind the refrigerator.
Would you care to explain these?
Hal, I'm sorry.
Lois, we are poor!
I thought we had an understanding.
I know.
You're right, Hal.
I just saw them in the store.
And they're not real Christian Louboutins.
They're just a cheap knockoff.
I just wanted to try them on, just for a second.
Then I saw them in the mirror, and they looked so elegant and glamorous, and I guess I just wanted for once in my life to see what it would feel like to be pretty.
Oh, please, I invented that act!
Everyone says they'll economize, but I'm the only one rinsing out baggies.
I'm the only one splitting two-ply toilet paper.
I'm the only one snacking out of birdfeeders!
Look at this!
$18 for a three-minute What the?

Welcome to the Hot Fantasy Sex Line.
-What's your name, baby?
-This is Are you aware kids call these numbers?
!
Put some clothes on!
Yeah, baby, would you like that?
Oh, you just love not responding, don't you?
You're such a bad boy.
Well, big spender, I can keep going as long as you can.
And that slapshot you took totally turned the game around!
Well, I wasn't aiming right for his mouth, but sometimes you get lucky.
You guys are not gonna believe what happened!
I was at the college, checking out the trees over by the sorority houses, and then this guy comes up to me and asks if I wanted a job!
Experimental drug testing?
He must've thought I was in college because of my binoculars and everything.
Can you believe it?
They pay people just to take pills!
Why is anyone doing anything else?
Reese, this is the kind of job they give to guys on death row.
Yeah, and I'm totally skipping that part.
Jamie, get out of here.
I have to Francis, I am not going to ask you again!
You tell me where you hid my pearl necklace!
Somewhere you'll never find it!
I have a hiding place so perfect, you could look for a hundred years and it won't matter!
Your earrings, your necklace, your bracelet, all your meaningless material possessions you hold so dear, gone forever!
Now I can go to military school knowing you're as miserable as I am, 'cause you'll never find it!
Ever!
The stash.
Jamie, where did you?
The stash?
!
What about the stash?
I didn't say anything about the stash.
I think I heard you very clearly say "the stash".
We don't talk about the stash unless we found the stash.
I didn't find the stash!
Okay, but I suggest you remember our deal.
If any of us does find it, we split Mom's reward three ways.
Because we're brothers and we love each other.
Malcolm, come on!
We're going to be late!
All right, all right, I'm coming.
Why aren't you wearing your smock?
Because the longer I don't put it on, the longer I can pretend I don't work in that soul killing fluorescent tomb.
As shocking as it may sound to you, I don't actually like stocking wart cream and telling 80-year-olds which diapers leak the least.
"Thank you, Mother, for getting me a job so I don't have to be a bum on the street".
"You're welcome".
"Can I open the door for you, after everything you've sacrificed for me"?
"Why, that's very thoughtful of you".
You really got to stop being such a snob.
There's pride in doing anything well.
I'd rather you were the best toilet scrubber in the world than a slapdash Supreme Court justice.
And how about showing me a little bit gratitude?
There's nothing embarrassing about working at Lucky Aide.
Listen to your mother.
She's a beautiful, foxy lady.
Okay, everything looks great.
You're young.
You're in excellent health.
You're a perfect candidate for this study.
Now, one last question: are you taking any other medications?
Of course not.
Of course not.
Of course not.
Of course not.
Of course not.
Billing.
Can I help you?
Yes!
I've just spent the last half hour trying to explain to you people!
You cannot charge me $800 for a phone call I never agreed to!
This is wrong and unethical!
You're absolutely right, sir.
We're bad.
What?
We've been very bad.
We need to be punished.
What would you like to do to us?
I don't want to do anything to you!
Whatever you want, big boy.
You're the one paying for this call.
Malcolm!
Malcolm!
Did you hear the news?
They fired Sam the stilt guy!
Word is he puked into the sunroof of the boss's El Dorado.
This is bad, Malcolm, really bad.
Bad?
He's been coming to work drunk for 20 years.
I meant bad for me.
This means they're paying attention!
Sam was my canary.
Now my work has to speak for itself!
Don't say I never listen to you, Malcolm.
I had to lobby hard for you, but you're replacing Sam.
It's 30 cents an hour more; you get to work outside and wave to all your friends.
This is so sweet.
I'm gonna make 2,500 bucks, and all I gotta do is swallow 300 pills a day and sneak Jamie's urine into a cup once in a while.
Calonil, Frageset.
Suppository.
These taste the worst.
Okay, Jamie, can you help your favorite brother find the stash?
Remember this, the necklace?
You know what I'm talking about, don't you?
Do you know what I'm talking about?
Oh, my God!
Where did you?
!
Can you show Dewey where you found this?
Sure, you can.
You show me where you found this, and we can write our ticket with Mom.
We cut Malcolm and Reese out.
It's just you and me.
Is it in the bathroom?
Mom's underwear drawer?
Of course!
She'd never think of looking for it there.
There's probably a false bottom or something.
What are you doing?
!
God, look at the dump this guy lives in.
It's not bad enough I have to take his job.
Now I have to take his stilts from him, too?
Those stilts are company property, and it's our responsibility to get them back.
It's nothing personal.
Cough up the stilts, alkie!
No, no!
Please don't do this to me.
I love my job!
Malcolm, you gotta help me!
Sam, I'm sorry.
I feel really terrible about this.
Don't drag this out, Malcolm.
You got to crush him like a bug.
It's kinder that way.
You're a ghost, old man.
No one can hear you.
Malcolm, please!
Just tell them you won't do it.
Then they'll have no choice.
They'll have to take me back!
Please, I'm begging you.
I'm Uncle Sam!
Please!
I have nothing else!
No family, no friends!
This is my life!
Please!
You want me to kiss your ass and call it ice cream?
I'll do it!
I'll do it!
It's ice cream!
That's delicious ice cream!
You know who has delicious ice cream?
That gas station down on Cedar.
Smells a little funky, but mm-mm-mm.
Malcolm, please!
Please!
Sam, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
No, no!
No, no!
Please!
Okay, grab the suit and we'll get out of Sam's hair.
Please!
Sorry, Sam.
Please!
Sorry.
No, Malcolm!
Sam, I'm sorry.
Please!
-I'm really, really, really sorry.
-Please!
Please!
Please!
I'm sorry.
Please!
I'm really sorry.
Please!
Give me liberty or give me death to cockroaches, fleas and ticks.
Lucky Aide Bug Bombs only $2.49.
Two years ago, I was thrown out of the locker room completely naked.
Compared to now, that was a moment of pride and quiet dignity.
Fourscore and seven stool softeners for the price of six.
How you doing, honey?
The manager says he hasn't heard you announce the Lucky Leader specials all morning.
No one cares about the special, Mom.
All right, if you want me to get up on a ladder and do it with you It's a grand old sale It's a high-flying sale On an exciting personal hygiene product that's new.
See?
It's fun when you get into it.
If your jock has a rash And you want to save cash There's a star-spangled ointment for you.
Crap.
I'd kill myself, except they'd run that picture in the paper.
Sorry I'm late, big guy!
Hey!
Where's the stopper for your pee hose?
Hey, man, you don't look so good.
You want to try some of these experimental drugs?
What's all this stuff?
I'm supposed to chart my progress in these journals.
You know, blackouts, hallucinations, routine stuff.
You're lactating?
Not all the time.
Usually, it just comes out in little sticky bubbles.
Hey, would you fill out a few of these for me?
My hand isn't writing down what I tell it to anymore.
I have to go shave my feet again.
Jamie, where did you go?
You were supposed to let me follow you!
I just turned my back for a second.
How did you do that?
!
Jamie, come on!
Do you have any idea how much this means to me?
Okay, what do you want?
Okay, I'll get you the pony.
But, first, you have to show me the stash.
Fine.
Pony first.
Oh, Dewey.
I need your help.
You're always skulking around, listening in on everyone's conversations.
Do you have any dirt on your mom?
I need something really big and awful.
I did something bad, so I have to find something that she did bad, then I can confess what I did, and it won't seem like such a big deal.
Sorry, Dad, but I don't just stash away information Stash?
You found the stash?
You and me partners.
We cut everyone else out.
No!
No!
I didn't find the stash!
Okay, okay.
Are you sure she's not having an affair?
Because that would be perfect.
Sorry, Dad.
I think she loves you.
Damn!
If I can't do the "You did bad, I did bad" thing, then I gotta do the "I did bad, you'll get a big, expensive present" thing.
Never get married, Dewey.
If you want kids, get your eggs from the state.
Mom, what are you doing?
I was in the middle of a game!
Do you want to explain why I found circled want ads sticking out of your backpack?
!
-Yes, I do.
-I'm not interested!
You are not finding another job!
Huh?
No!
I You are not getting a job away from my constant supervision, and that's it.
I'm not going to risk your future by giving you even a second of freedom!
This family has too much invested in you.
Oh, cheer up.
Once I find a proper wife for you, you'll have your precious space.
Hi.
Yes.
Do you have a pair of Christian Louboutins red open-toed sling-backs, size 8½?
Not the knockoffs, the real thing.
You do?
!
Good!
Now, I'm in a situation where money is no object, but how much?
Would you put a pair aside for me, please?
Right.
Yes.
They will make a nice surprise.
Hello?
Reese?
Francis, you gotta help me.
I don't want to take drugs anymore.
Oh, geez.
Okay, Reese, I want you to tell me very specifically what kind of drugs did you take?
All of them.
Dude, didn't you learn anything from when my friends baby-sat you?
Remember Richie trying to dry you off in the oven?
I don't know how it happened, but I think I did something bad.
I don't know what to do.
Reese, I want you to listen very carefully.
You're going to be okay.
I'm gonna talk you through this.
Now, the first and most important thing you have to do is Okay, Jamie, I need you to focus.
You got your toy.
Now take me to the stash.
Here?
Do we have to dig for it?
Jamie, come back!
You can't just go into someone else's house!
Get back here!
Come on, Jamie!
Hurry!
Before someone sees you!
I'm not kidding.
You're going to get caught!
See?
That's the ringleader!
They've been stealing stuff from my house all week!
Every two years, they have another baby just so they can fit through the window!
Hal?
What are you doing here?
Is everything all right?
Not yet, but it will be as soon as you put these on.
Are you crazy?
If loving your wife is crazy, then I'm a drooling lunatic.
You deserve the moon and the sky, Lois.
Maybe someday I'll be able to buy them for you, but for now, these will have to do.
Oh, Hal.
Thank you.
I accidentally spent $800 on phone sex.
I was doing my makeup in the rear view mirror, and I ran over your golf clubs.
I burned a hole in your favorite dress.
You didn't get that promotion because I called your boss a fat-ass at the Christmas party.
I lost my wedding ring three years ago.
This is part of a lawnmower.
Your Aunt Lucy isn't angry with you.
She's dead.
I just forgot to tell you.
I've read that the Chinese invented stils so they could survive among Panda bears.
Of course, that was before they built the Great Wall.
After that, only the Emperor was allowed to walk on them.
Well, I had to do it behind Mom's back, but I was going through the want ads, and I finally found That explains the 15-foot high cloud of bourbon I was smelling.
You stole my life!
Sam, great!
I-I was just about to call Oh, my God!
Don't worry, Malcolm.
I'll help you!
Sam, you've got to listen to me!
Hang on!
Damn it!
What aisle are the screwdrivers in?
Wich batteries are the double A?
The little ones, or the really little ones?
Sam, please listen I'm never gonna shake this guy.
He's way too good.
I can't outstilt him.
I can't outstilt him, but I can outskate him.
Okay, your brother got the funeral he wanted.
Now let's get our $15 back.
Once again, brains triumph over This hurts so much worse than it looks.
You're a Yankee Doodle dead man.
The weird thing is, I always knew I'll died this way.
Okay, God, you've had your fun.
Please, I'll settle for the lamest, most pathetic miracle you've got lying around.
Just Well, I purposely dropped that bowling ball on your foot so you couldn't go to your high school reunion!
I'm two years older than you think I am!
Damn it, Hal, we're to point here I don't think either one of us wants to get to!
What are we supposed to do?
!
I've just got so much rage built up Are these your boys?
You little monsters!
How dare you get into trouble again?
!
After all your mother does for you!
Your father slaves away to put a roof over your head, and this is how you repay him?
!
Okay, everybody, let's just calm down Why don't you mind your own business?
We don't need you coming in here and telling us how to handle our children.
We know what we're doing.
Thank you very much.
Mom, Dad, the drugs are weared off.
Sundance, baby, is that you?
Will you listen to me?
!
I found you a job!
What?
I found you a job!
I've been trying to tell you.
It's perfect for you!
It's at the circus!
The circus?
In what world do you depreciate an elephant over two years?
!
I want this all redone tonight!
What are you looking at?
Get back to work!
That is fantastic son!
Reese's roommate in detox is a lawyer.
He thinks he can blackmail him into defending his felony case!
That's great.
Hey, the feeling is back.
Apparently, the medical term for what happened to me is "Holy crap, come look at this".
because that's all the ER guys kept saying.
But if I ever have to give birth, it'll be really easy.
And Mom seems to be in a good mood lately.
The toilet's backed up again!
I'll get it.

So, if Rex Huntington is the finest doctor in Spring Valley, why is he defending Jessica in the murder trial.
Because, before he got pushed off that mountain and got amnesia, he was the finest lawyer in Spring Valley.
What I can't believe is Jessica is having an affair with the judge.
I mean, he's totally using her to get his hands on the Farnsworth fortune.
You can't ground me!
That fire could have been started by anybody!
Why don't you ever take my side?
!
You never listen anything I say!

Hello, class.
Hello, Principal Jeffers.
You've come at a very exciting time.
We're about to open a new box of key clips.
And how are we all today, students?
I know no one gives a crap about the kids in this class, but could you get us some books so we could actually learn something?
The only thing we've done here for the last ten weeks is make lanyards!
You know what subject I hated most when I was a kid?
Math.
Dewey, I need you to re-sort my pills again.
I just finished sorting them.
It took me a half hour.
I know.
But then I unsorted them so I could see if I could sort them by myself.
I can't.
All right.
Just don't touch them anymore.
I'll do it with you after school.
Dewey, I need your help after school.
I'm already helping Hanson.
But I need you!
The sidewalks told me they wouldn't let me walk home anymore.
Can you?
Okay, just wait till I'm done, then I'll walk you home.
But, seriously, you guys have to start trying to do a little more for yourselves.
Oh, that reminds me.
My uncle died, and my parents were wondering if you'd explain death to me.
Are you studying?
Yeah.
My stupid teachers wait until the end of my senior year to tell me I have final exams.
In every single class!
I've got to get serious now.
If the finals are anything like this practice test, it's gonna be brutal.
It's just a bunch of true/false questions.
So it's a 50-50 chance.
Do you know what the odds are of getting one of those right?
$23 for the neighborhood association.
The annual meeting is tomorrow night.
It's been a year already?
Those people are relentless.
You think, if we showed up once, they'd stop inviting us?
-That's always been the pattern.
-Hal, don't worry.
You have a good excuse.
Tomorrow you're cleaning the dead possum out of the chimney.
The smell has gotten so bad, I can't tell when Jamie needs changing anymore.
You know, if we just wait a few more weeks, it'll disintegrate on its own.
Tomorrow, Hal.
I'm sick of all those crows on roof.
Hey, Dad.
What?
Wait.
You think patriotism is a joke?
!
Representative government is an outdated sham?
I can't believe my ears!
What are you talking about?
What did he say?
I can't even repeat it.
I'm sorry, Lois, but the chimney will just have to wait.
I'm taking Malcolm to the neighborhood association meeting.
Let's hope seeing democracy in action will give our little cynic a wake-up call.
Chad, I have to finish correcting everyone's homework.
It's been in your mouth a half an hour.
Either spit it out or swallow it.
Dewey?
Oh, hey, Francis.
You want to talk to Mom?
No.
I called to talk to you.
Me?
Really?
Yeah.
Listen.
I'm up for a job as activities director at a summer camp, but I have to show them what kind of program I can put together.
I need you to help me.
-You want my help?
-Yeah.
I have all these great ideas for games, so I'm gonna come home tomorrow so I can play them with you.
You know, to make sure they're fun enough.
So how does that sound?
Like a setup for a cruel practical joke, but I'm willing to take the risk.
Excuse me.
We're here for the homeowners meeting.
Oh, my God!
Really?
Oh, that's fantastic!
Jim Phipps.
I'm the association's attorney.
So where is everyone?
Well, I kind of am everyone.
No one's ever shown up for a homeowners meeting in 20 years.
You're kidding.
Not one person?
Not one not one I send out 150 flyers every year, exactly as mandated by the developer, but nobody ever comes.
I've upgraded the doughnuts, but people just don't seem to be interested.
So, every year, you rent a room, and hold a meeting for nobody?
Absolutely.
My contract with the developer is very clear.
In exchange for a $2,000 annual retainer, I'm to conduct annual meetings, take the minutes, and manage the association's financial interests.
Financial interest?
Well, actually, there aren't any.
I didn't mean to come off so self-important.
Only the homeowners can decide where the money goes, so I've just been putting the dues in a savings account.
The bank gave me a toaster in 1987.
I never even opened the box.
So, 150 homes paying 23 bucks over 20 years, passbook interest, minus the retainer Oh, my God!
If my math is right, he's sitting on at least $83,000!
Who am I kidding?
Of course my math is right.
You know, it sure would be nice to have someone finally take charge of this thing.
Would you ever consider being president of the neighborhood association?
I don't think so.
It sounds like work.
Dad, what are you talking about?
Of course you want to be president!
This is your chance to really do something for the community.
-I don't think -You can't turn this down.
You've always told me that a real citizen is willing to make sacrifices for the greater good.
-This doesn't sound like -And I took those words to heart!
They inspired me.
And now I have a chance to see my own dad show me what democracy is all about.
You can't deny me that.
-Well -It's not just for me.
It's for our family, our block, the whole neighborhood!
Think of all the people you could help.
The world is waiting for you to make it a better place!
Well Okay.
I'll do it.
Finally!
This is exactly the reason I went into zoning law.
I don't see how this helps.
Where's Dewey?
When I was his age, I was out of school hours ago.
Doing independent study at the library not smoking.
So, it's exciting about the job.
Yeah.
It's been a long hunt, but it finally paid off.
Don't you have to have some kind of degree or something to work with children?
You never think anything I ever do is good enough!
I happened to do very well at that interview.
All I have to do now is just show them that I can put together a good program for the summer.
So you don't have the job.
I have the job!
What don't you understand about that?
!
I don't know.
It just sounds like the real estate thing all over again.
Why can't you just have faith in me for once?
!
Gin.
Want to play again?
Sure.
-You know who's hiring?
-I have a job!
I am appalled.
This completion stitch is kinked.
Young lady, if you neglect your education, you deny yourself the keys to success.
Dewey, wait!
I can't.
I have to get home to see my brother.
But I need you to help me with the algebra problems you gave me.
I went over those problems 20 times!
But my head passhrough a magnet, and I think I forgot everything.
I'm sorry!
I can't!
I can't do this anymore.
I'm sorry.
It's okay, Dewey.
We understand.
Yeah.
Go have fun with your brother.
We'll be fine.
Everyone turn in their assignments.
I have to take this one home with me.
It doesn't believe that I have a cat.
It's 3:00.
It is now time to clear your area!
I don't think you want to do anything physical with Chad.
Don't test me, young man.
I am an educator who is not afraid to use discipline.
All right.
Now it's a matter for the police.
Dewey!
What do we do?
He's not here.
Somebody do something!
Excuse me, Mr. Flerch?
Well I think of the three ideas we had, this was the best.
I win!
Good job.
Okay, Dewey, of all the things we did today, what seemed like it could be more fun?
The rainbow acle course or the tickle maze or the shower of lollipops?
I have to tell it was all fantastic.
It was by far the best day of my life.
I can make you happier.
"President, comma, Newcastle Adjacent Neighborhood Association".
Hal, that is so fancy.
Feel the little duck.
That's embossed.
So.
How's my little bureaucrat?
Fantastic.
I'm just finishing up the details in all the neighborhood initiatives you've been talking about.
I was?
Yeah.
Remember you said, "I hope I do a good job"?
Obviously that mean structural improvements: like installing lights at the basketball court and building a skate park and Friday night dance parties with a killer DJ.
Isn't that kind expensive?
You have to think of it as an investment.
It's actually expensive not to do it.
There's $87,000 in the account?
Well, a lot of it gets eaten up servicing the infrastructure.
Like, there's no point in having a DJ if you're not going to have a really rock sound system.
Why are we just give the homeowners a refund check?
We could.
But we wouldn't have the money for what you said was the most important thing security.
Security is big.
I've been racking my brain, trying find a way to give every area equal protection.
I wish there was some magic kind of mobile security system that could weave through the neighborhood.
Like a security car?
Dad that's brilliant!
And then citizens from the neighborhood could drive a car out to make sure there's no trouble.
I don't know.
Purchasing a car isn't the only expense.
You got to think about storage fees Wait, we could park it at our house.
You have a real talent for this.
Hey, it's almost lunchtime.
Where's Flerch?
I don't know.
You'd think he'd be here by now, but he definitely isn't.
I know.
I'm so fed up, I don't even think it's worse complaining about.
Listen, guys, I'm sorry I blew up be here yesterday.
I guess I just kind needed a break.
Forget it Dewey.
We need start doing things on our own.
And you know what?
I think we're already doing things we didn't think we were capable of.
Did you pull all night?
Yeah.
Math.
I kept getting confused, so I'm making a list of all the numbers Where do they stop?
The state-of-the-art rehearsal studio is essentially free, because once the garage band makes it big, the community gets ten percent of the record sales.
So it's basically the same business model as the extreme sport camp.
So, did you get a chance to go through my proposal for a girls' volleyball tournament?
Well -Jim, what are you doing here?
-I had to share this with you.
What is it?
I was so inspired by what your son said, that I went beyond the requirements of my retainer and wrote a new constitution for the Neighborhood Association.
Pro bono of course.
It's designed, so that everyone in a comunity will have an equal voice in all decisions.
I think it'll really get people participating.
That sounds great, Jim.
Thanks.
No, thank you for showing up at that meeting and making me belive again.
What a jerk.
What?
Why?
Coming in here with his agenda like you are not doing fantastic job when you are.
I think he just want the voice of the people to be heard.
You are the voice of the people.
You are the one with the vision.
You are the one with the amazing ideas topping out of you every second.
- Maybe not every second.
- Yes.
Your brain is a factory of ideas.
Please do not close the factory.
You know, sometimes it's feels like a factory.
Of course it does.
You are the leader of this community.
Everybody recognizes it and they love for it.
Well don't worry son, I won't let the people down.
Okay, Dewey, I've got a pretty good handle on these games, I just want ask you some questions.
Okay.
When I was cheering encouragement at you, did it ever make you feel scared or angry?
What?
No.
Good.
And when you lost the candy tag, did it make you feel bad and want to hurt yourself?
What do you talking about Francis?
This questions are weird.
I'm just try understand better, Dewey.
I mean, I don't know all the right questions ask kids like you.
What you mean "kids like me"?
Well, you're in that class.
And this is a special camp for children with your needs.
I'm not emotionally disturbed, what the hell is wrong with you?
There's nothing wrong with either of us.
I'm not in that class because I'm disturbed!
I'm in that class so I can help You're a jerk!
Okay, my games obviously have too much sugar.
Is everything okay?
Yeah.
This is my favorite time of day.
The sun's about to come up and my mean voice is still asleep.
I hate walking to school in the dark.
I have to run past people's houses so I don't catch their nightmares.
We have to tell Dewey about this.
No.
This is exactly the kind of thing he doesn't want to be bothered with.
We can't handle taking care of Flerch!
If he dies, we're gonna have to tell everybody!
Are you saying I'm not doing a good job feeding him?
I chewed his steak for 20 minutes before I gave it to him!
Oh, help me!
It's my heart, weakened as it was by a childhood ailment!
He's dying!
I totally called this!
Give him CPR!
- I-I'm not strong enough!
- We have to keep his heart pumping.
Use your legs!
Chad, help him breathe.
One, two, three, breathe!
One, two, three, breathe!
One, two, three, breathe!
One, two, three, breathe!
Wait.
I saw this thing on TV once where they helped a guy breathe by cutting a hole in his throat and jamming a pen in it!
I've got a pen!
Somebody get scissors!
Eddie, for God sake, help me!
They're gonna kill me!
I'm sorry I assumed you could break-dance!
I'm actually one-sixteenth Cherokee myself!
Dad, you okay?
Malcolm, I couldn't sleep.
My mind has been on fire with the possibilities of what this neighborhood could become.
At first it seemed crazy and kind of stupid, but then I remembered what you said about the factory!
In the middle of the night I had a vision.
You had a vision without me?
- "Mulberry Village"?
- Mulberry Village.
A new utopia!
What the hell is all this stuff?
Just a few compulsory guidelines to help people make the transition.
"Failure to smile 'Hello,' $50 fine?
Not knowing your neighbor's name: $25?
Failure to remove your fence: $100"?
People can be resistant to change.
- What's the "Hug your child" initiative?
- Everyone has to publicly hug their child at least once a day.
A hotline will be set up so that children can inform on non-hugging parents.
You're going to make kids inform on their parents?
Parents, neighbors, teachers, everybody!
If they've got nothing to hide, they've got nothing to worry about.
Tell me about the "reeducation center".
Oh!
That's where the best, most neighborly children will be plucked from the corrupting influence of their families, and immersed in round-the-clock friendliness training.
I call them the Mulberry Youth.
Dad give me the fliers.
Thank you, son, but they've already been distributed throughout the whole neighborhood.
Like a modern-day Martin Luther, I nailed them to the front doors.
Maybe we should go out the back door and spend the rest of the day at the library.
Not now, Malcolm.
The villagers are coming.
Look, I told you, leave me alone.
I'm just going to ask your teacher if I can have ten minutes with your buddies at recess.
What the hell happened?
!
Isn't it obvious?
I know we're not supposed to ask for help, Dewey, but this one kind of got away from us.
We gotta get out of here.
Let's go call the police.
You're just gonna bail?
You don't understand these kids.
If I fix this problem, there's going to be a hundred more.
It never stops with them!
Dewey you don't get to choose the people who need your help.
Look, I don't know much, but I do know two things.
These kids need your help, you gotta do it.
And even though I've never met him, that guy is a total dink.
I thought when I decided to help, something would come to me, but I'm completely blank.
You're all going to jail.
If you untie me in the next five seconds, you and you alone will see some slight leniency.
Lanyards belong in the lanyard box.
What?
That's my lanyard.
I made it.
Mr. Flerch is going to flip out if you don't put it back in the lanyard box.
You couldn't have made this.
I bought it at a truck stop Can I see that, Francis?
Can you think of any connection between the thousands of lanyards that were made by the emotionally disturbed children at your school, and this one my brother found for sale at a retail outlet?
Mr. Jeffers, I would be horrified to think that a public school principal would use innocent children as slave labor.
I don't know what you're talking about, young man.
It was all his idea!
I'm just his obedient stooge!
He dangled Assistant Vice Principal in front of me!
It came with parking!
I wonder who would get the worst penalty.
A bunch of emotionally disturbed kids who tied people up for a little while or the trusted public servant who forced them into slavery?
We could ask a judge, or everyone could just keep quiet about everything.
Sound okay to you guys?
That depends.
Can we get five minutes alone with these guys before you untie them?
-What's up with Mom?
-She just saw my report card.
I flunked out of every single class.
What?
Every single one of my finals, I got every question wrong.
Oh, my God.
I know.
Now I get to repeat my senior year!
Isn't this great?
I worked so hard for this.
I had to make sure I flunked every class so completely, I couldn't make it up in summer school.
Now I don't have to move out or go to college or get a job for a whole 'nother year!
This is the greatest achievement of my entire life!
Yeah, I know, Mom.
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
Oh, geez Hey, can one of you boys give me a hand?
What do you need?
Just hold this steady.
Thanks, Malcolm.
I'm glad it's you.
Whenever Reese helps, he always seems to hurt himself.
Malcolm in the Middle - 6.22 - Mrs. Tri-County Forom.com & Malcolm-France.com Wait, wait, how about this?
"Mother's wonderful, quiet dignity".
No, her "sensitive, quiet dignity".
What are you guys doing?
We were at the mall and they had these entry forms for the Mrs. Tri-County contest.
Look at these questions.
"How does your mother bring joy into your life"?
How about the time she shaved the word "liar" into my head?
"She always finds time to dote on our personal appearance".
What's so funny?
Reese saw a Japanese guy on the Internet puke into an electric fan.
They are ahead of us in so many ways.
All right, how bad is it?
Nothing past second notice so far.
What's that?
Apparently I've been entered into the Mrs. Tri-County Pageant.
What?
The boys entered me in this pageant.
"lucky to have her in our lives".
"Too special to be kept a secret" "She suffers in silence"?
Oh, can you believe this?
I know.
They do all these horrible things and then they go and do something like this.
Yes, well, they're good boys.
God, I think of suffering through all those pageants slaving for my sister all those years.
Susan was always the big star, and I was her invisible little troll.
Carrying her gowns for Queen of Harvest Festival, ironing her sash for Miss Mammogram.
Well, no one ever appreciates the star maker, Lois.
Once I was hemming her dress for Dairy Princess and a photographer stood on my back to take her picture.
Bastards wouldn't know a Dairy Princess if it came up and bit them on the ass.
Boy, it would really show her if I entered this pageant.
What?
Well, it wouldn't hurt to go down there and see what it's all about.
Great.
Let's do it.
You little monsters!
You have really done it this time!
Dad, it was a joke.
I didn't know Reese was going to mail the stupid thing.
We were just goofing around.
I can't believe she took it seriously.
You're right, Dewey.
Your mother actually believes her sons love her.
What a moron.
I've got it.
Why don't you just blindfold your mother and throw her down some stairs?
!
That'd be fun!
-We're sorry.
-Yeah.
Well, it's too late for sorry.
Here's what's going to happen.
We are all going down to the Civic Center as a family, and you boys are going to do everything in your power to make sure this is the most unhumiliating night of your mother's life.
This is a big deal.
I have to be honest, I'm feeling kind of nervous here.
You don't pay mileage, I had to park in the structure, and you call this a gift bag?
I saw two judges with the mini-lipstick set and the lemon scented moisturizer.
Mr. Herkabe, what are you doing here?
I happen to be one of the judges.
What, may I ask, are you doing here?
You know, curiosity.
It's kind of a sociologically interesting My God, your mother's in the pageant.
Well, technically.
And I happen to have certain powers that might influence that outcome.
Isn't that interesting?
What?
I just think that's really interesting.
Don't you find it interesting?
Yeah, I guess I'm gonna have to.
I'm sorry, sir.
They were out of the moisturizer, but I found these.
Fine.
I'll take the smoked almonds, the loofah glove Oh, just give me the whole box.
All right, ladies, sign in.
You'll get your schedules, your parking permits, and your dressing area assignments.
Also, make sure that you get back here by 3:00 sharp for a group photo with the state's largest pumpkin.
Look at all these old broads trying to look hot.
I mean, don't know they know we're done with them?
Donna?
Donna, is that you?
Lois!
I haven't seen you since Miss Teen Gas and Power.
What a memory you have.
Was that the time when the judges carried me around on their shoulders?
Darlene, Jeanie, Anne.
Look who's here.
Look at all of you.
I can't believe you're still doing pageants.
Well, I actually quit a few years back.
It was time to get to know my kids a little better.
But then September 11th happened, and We just can't let them win.
So where's your sister?
Susan isn't here.
I'm entering this myself.
I love stuff like that.
Don't feel bad.
The rest of us don't have a chance either.
Donna somehow got Nina Perucci to coach her.
Nina Perucci.
How did you manage that?
Well, Max got a nice bonus for Christmas, and let's just say I had a yeast infection until he wrote the check.
Is that your chin?
No, Nina.
Is that your smile?
No, Nina.
Is that your bust?
No, Nina.
She's amazing.
She pioneered the use of backstage laxatives.
Lois, if we don't sign up right now, we're going to get a dressing area without a hook.
Is that what you want?
Bye.
Well, I think we know who's winning Mrs. Deluded.
Donna I didn't think it was possible, but the Mrs. Tri-County Pageant is about to get even uglier.
I made the appointment for your facial tomorrow.
I don't want to pick out jewelry until after we choose the gown.
Now, the red one is nice, it's tasteful and really sets off your hair.
But the blue one has a nicer drape and you cannot beat its "wow" factor.
You know what?
Let me worry about that.
You can concentrate on your talent.
I don't know, Hal.
I'm not even sure you can call it a talent.
What are you talking about?
It is going to be great.
That's why I blocked out the next three hours for you to work with Dewey.
Dad, I have homework.
Oh, just buy it from the guy Reese buys his from.
Okay, ladies, I know you've all done it a million times before, but let's just walk through it once anyway.
Blue line ladies, cross over the red mark.
Green line, cross over the yellow mark.
Blue line, stop at the orange mark, step left and cross to the green line.
Green line, stop to the black mark, step right and cross to the green line.
Malcolm, I need you to do a job for me.
It's urgent.
I've been exchanging some very meaningful glances with one of the contestants.
You know they're all married, don't you?
Yes, of course.
And that's why it would be indecent of me not to be discrete.
Darlene Fisher.
Green sweat suit.
I need you to pass her this note for me.
You want me to find out if she likes you?
Forget it.
I respect your stand, Malcolm, and I want you to know this will in no way affect my judging of your mother.
Or will it?
Okay, you're next.
Now, no matter what question they ask you, remember to use your key phrases: "empowering women, the beauty within, helping those in need".
And don't forget, end with "May God bless America".
Right, right, and when do I say the stuff about world peace?
No, no, no, no, no, we got rid of that.
You don't want to come off like a liberal nut case.
Yes, I am a mother, but I also have to remember that I'm a woman.
A woman who's not afraid to give because it feels so good.
Thank you.
Okay, Lois here's your question if you're ready.
"How has motherhood kept you young"?
I'm sorry, but I have a problem with the question.
Motherhood definitely does a lot of things, but the one thing it does not do is keep you young.
Oh, my God, it ages you horribly.
Youth is about having choices, but once you're a mother, you have no choices.
You're stuck loving your children.
You get gray hair loving them.
You lose sleep loving them.
You lose out on all those other things that you always thought you'd do.
But even with all of that, the amazing thing is, you're okay with it.
It's like some wonderful curse.
That was amazing.
I don't know where you came up with that crap, but you nailed it.
Okay, Donna, here we go.
"What aspect of being a woman do you find most fulfilling"?
What kind of stupid question is that?
Excuse me?
I don't mean that you're stupid.
I the question is I mean I'm not fulfilled.
It's awful being a woman, right?
Right?
I'm cursed with children, too.
I never wanted to have kids.
I just wanted to But I do love America.
How 'bout our country, huh?
Did you see that?
She went up like the Hindenberg.
Wow, I guess I'm really doing okay.
So are you going to keep wasting time high-fiving yourself, or are we going to get back to work?
Okay, honey, that was pretty good.
Unfortunately, there are three counties full of women who are "pretty good".
We need a winner.
I think this would be going so much better if I could sing or dance or play a musical instrument.
We'll get to you, Lois.
Right now Dewey's our problem.
Now, son, I don't know anything about music, but this is how you should be playing it.
Now, in the middle part, you're doing And I want to hear more of That's never gonna happen.
You know, I really don't need this from you right now.
We've got one day to get the dress ready, our shoes aren't dyed and we have no idea where we're going with our hair!
Hal, calm down.
What's happening?
I thought this was supposed to be fun.
It is.
See?
Mom had better win this thing.
I'm getting to know way too much about Herkabe's love life.
You got anything yet?
This judges' manual is unbelievable.
It's over 200 pages of these really specific rules on what's attractive and what isn't.
There's a whole page on ankle symmetry.
And you know what I learned?
What?
I'm beautiful.
What are you talking about?
Everything on my face is the absolute standard of perfection.
My lips are exactly twice the length of the distance between my eyes.
My philtrum is gracefully tapered.
My earlobe is the perfect And it just goes on and on.
You can measure me if you don't believe it.
Are you going to help Mom or not?
I understand your anger, Malcolm.
Unattractive people can become very threatened by this.
It's probably why I have so few friends.
Malcolm!
I need a favor.
I already did you a favor with Darlene.
Which worked out spectacularly.
And athletically.
And repeatedly.
What else do you want?
I need you to break up with her.
What?
She's gotten so clingy and dependent.
She's suffocating me.
Feel free to judge me, but remember who's judging your mother.
Give her this note.
At first I toyed with the idea of lying to her, but then I decided to tell her honestly I find her repellent.
It's better to be classy.
Malcolm!
Find your brother and get back here.
The judges need to see all of us gazing adoringly up at your mother.
Those Hendersons are making us look like chimps.
His smile is fading.
Give him another hit.
I don't know how you do this.
I've never felt such butterflies in my entire life.
Good luck, everybody.
Your mascara is clumping!
What did I tell you about blinking?
!
What is it?
!
I know.
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Miss Tri-County Pageant.
Here's your host, Channel Two's acclaimed meteorologist, Dr. Dave Nelson.
Hey there, Mrs. Tri-County.
A lady from head to toe A nurse, a maid, a teacher and a hottie All wrapped up in a bow It's time to sparkle and start the show So come on, take a bow America needs you like never before and "mom" is just an upside down "wow"!
I lost a pin?
I lost a pin!
Oh, this isn't happening!
Hold on.
Wait, what are you doing?
Now your hair's ruined.
So, we'll both be a little off.
Come on, everybody, let's go.
And please step forward Charlotte!
Ladies and gentlemen, the judges have unanimously decided that these five women will not be going to the next round!
And you ladies are!
We're going to take a short break now so our lucky five can get ready for the Glamour Parade!
Malcolm.
Come here.
Malcolm.
Reese, what are you doing?
Dad's been looking all over for you.
I'm leaving, Malcolm.
I'm claiming my birthright.
What?
I'm about to become a star, and from what I understand, I have to ruthlessly separate myself from you pathetic hangers-on, and probably eventually sue your asses.
Take care, Malcolm.
I'll see you in court.
Well, it may be with a 20% chance of rain but it's about to get a lot hotter in here.
Where's Jeanie?
We were all going to wear tiaras for Glamour Parade and we're all going to wear tiaras.
Thank you, Jeanie.
Thank all of you.
as we present the Mrs. Tri-County Glamour Parade.
What's wrong?
What happened?
Usually, we let the judges decide who gets to wear the tiara.
Ladies and gentlemen, please, remain clam.
There's no reason to panic.
Okay, I'm ready.
For what?
Whatever it is you do with beautiful people.
I'll give you 20% and not a penny more.
You may have to travel because I'm going to have a house in Miami, Milan, and that Disneyworld in France.
You're welcome to fly my private jet, but I want you to keep it real.
I'd also like a falcon.
What are you talking about?
I can't do anything with you.
What?
Why not?
I've read the book, I measured everything.
I'm perfect!
It's true, you do have the perfect features for a middle-aged woman.
If you want to, have a sex change, come back in 20 years and we'll talk.
No, please!
This can't be how it ends.
I'm supposed to have three rocky marriages and die in a hotel fire!
Don't send me home!
I'm too perfect to live like a person!
Okay, people reacted badly to the crown thing, so you gotta nail the talent portion.
Now, I know you think it isn't a talent, but if you commit, we can make those oversized Barbies choke on their own batons.
What are you doing?
Where's your top hat and fishnet thigh-highs?
Just get the car and the kids, Hal, and let's just slink out of here.
Wait, you can't just walk away.
Oh, yes, I can.
This whole thing has been a disaster.
I don't belong here.
And I hate the way those women make me feel.
Come on, they're just a bunch of bitter hags.
And I hate the way you've been making me feel.
We may have our ups and downs, Hal, but this is the first time I ever felt like I wasn't good enough for you.
You're right.
I'm sorry.
I mean, I know you're perfect, and for once, I wanted the whole world to know it.
Well, that's a nice idea, but that isn't going to happen.
I don't know why I ever thought I could compete with these women.
Hal, I can't handle them.
I'm out of my league here.
What are you talking about?
Do you know why those broads pulled that stunt?
They're afraid of you, Lois.
Right now you are surrounded by a bunch of idiots who fear you.
You're not out of your league, you're at home.
Lois, where have you been?
Come on, let's go.
You're up.
You've got to go.
Whining isn't going to make me go any faster.
Yes!
And now our third contestant, Lois, will be accompanied by her lovely daughter, Dewey.
There's Mommy.
Would the new Mrs. Tri-County like another scoop of fudge ripple?
Well, this sash still has a couple of inches of slack.
Keep it coming.
This is so nice.
Look at this.
A $40 coupon for new tires, a box of steaks, a label maker!
Oh, this is nice.
I wish Reese wasn't too busy sulking to enjoy it with us.
Give him a little time.
