{START OF EPISODE 1}
Okay, know something about my family.
We are not leaving all together.
But when we do, always a wrong decision but persevering.
When you say, all life prohibited How's life who you mean?
Mama, I'm going to fall to the floor!
Never again will I order something.
I should have just not had!
I can not tolerate such behavior.
Believe it or not, I'd rather be with Dewey.
Just being with the babysitter!
And then that bubble appeared and I started follow but did not know where he was.
Then I went to the bag and then I did not know where he was.
And then I saw you I thought maybe you could help me Because you helped another person in a movie.
So if I can lend a hand, will thank you.
Thanks anyway Equivalent to 110 degrees here In more heat, it's like an oven and worse still we are without radio.
Hal, stop to look back That car has been pursuing Just cum and let it go Oh that making signs with lights Want it that way eh For God's Hal!
He could have a gun!
Just let it go Oh agreement ended.
I say pass on this side Forward fucking sucking sugar!
C'mon, it's just an accident that is waiting to happen A, B, C, D. A, B, C, D. A, B, C, D. It's good that you have found, not sure that a child is only here.
Do not worry, I'll take you home with your parents again Should be very worried Follow with E A, B, C, D, E I know A, B, C, D. ..
A, B, C, D. ..
Sugar preserves nutrients.
How can something so simple be so delicious?
Those things are nasty, Francis You have to be fancy eating them, yes, But for me the "Candy Cuack" are a perfect meal I could eat up to 100 No way all that crap on your stomach would grow Not even the 50 would pass I'm afraid you're wrong Joe.
Since I am a child I always dissolve rapidly, never got fat.
Actually, I It is sufieciente, shut up!
always talk about how they can leave this eating 100 or 100 of that The "cuacks" would expand.
You're an idiot if you think differently Well let me tell you something.
If I say I can eat 100 cuacks, can assure you that my word is a guarantee.
And no need to resort to personal attacks Because I hate going to the bathroom and check your dirty boxers in the shower.
This is so cool With a bit of dynamite around, fly around in the air.
The explosion would be great There would be nothing.
Reese Yes, this is great.
We trapped for hours without food or air conditioning.
I guess it could be worse Could be a boy in the middle the sun trying to bring order Why can not you just open a line?
Miss, crazy if you think you were unsuccessful in opening this road Yes, but if you just move those two cars would a place to go I do not understand how they can be so stupid Lady, do not call the police stupid What is a law that now?
See, long ago ate 7 pounds of potato chips in a city So I think my body could stand We are not talking about french fries Francis We are talking about pure sucrose The human body simply can not absorb In extreme cases can the human body stand but is only 75% confidence If you eat too much blood in your body not flow and you pass out Gentlemen, gentlemen These arguments are useless One Look at them, only keep spinning There are a lot of cars full of people are supposed to have to go somewhere And they just stay there standing and talking.
What Fight?
Hey, let me clarify something This is a road car Are grown, do your job!
"Although it is listening to me?
It could be me Oh Hal, could not be any of us Noo, our car direct slides transit, and got caught This totally sucks More than an hour ago we're here!
What is the point of going around in the middle traffic?
You see, you can find things like this Smells like dirty feet Reese, Can we go back to the car?
feel I'm dying Ice Cream!
Go away!
No ice cream truck He's lying.
There are tons ice cream in there The ice cream truck is not for sale Law is against him to sell them ice cream the traffic!
That's too bad You can make money selling the boys That's the point.
You're evil!

Calm down, no we can do Yes there is, I can, I can And I know about the idiot who is also Hey, you're talking about my brother.

Honey, if you wish to answer a question first you have to wait What is this tattoo?
You know?
I need to buy a pack of cigarettes For the first time in 20 years Hurry please Hello Think Lois I stopped to tie my shoes in the parking lot If I had not done Would be 200 yards ahead and would not dissolve in the heat And if you had not ever had your body here Dewey would have had to It's all mathematical, Hal.

But you're not in my situation Okay I'll leave here with the police.
All right.
You feel like God with this view Atravezarlo hate bush Not serve in any way.
See how we can protect or something?
Why are we here?
Just looking at the views Look at that crazy woman Well, tell me about that special kind It's horrible I am surrounded by stupid boys and no one was at my level I did all these college classes y. ..
Oh what a nightmare!
You are not careful doing all these tasks Harvard silly!
You do not understand Malcolm Even more geniuses do not stop for an hour and a half Really all it does is push yourself over Anyone would expect from most in my situation Today is the perfect test.
Look at this mess!
What will happen to us?
If it were not for this, we would never have known.
I never felt it coming!
This girl is amazing!
Broken legs He then went to my head asking How long do I have?
What have I done with my life?
Tell me, what is my contribution?
You go home at night Knowing you are helping the world to be a better place Following line by line And that's a real man If only I could feel that feeling of accomplishment for once in my life Do you know how special you are not?
C. ..
Y. ..

W. ..
Ok let me explain We've been waiting all afternoon for a crane.
And now, the crane is here That's true.
And the man operating the crane is here too!

So why nothing is happening!
Look we can not touch anything until the researcher send us a report.
Last time that we are here, where?
Well that's something the department.
No it's my job to know.
..
Turn the crane!
You can not tell me what I have to do Hey not so fast friend What do you think?
Nothing just watching!
What the hell happens?
This kid was trying to get in your truck.
Let go!
I just wanted ice cream!
You deserve no ice cream.
And you do not deserve to be an ice cream!
Come here bastard!
That's what you get for your trouble.
Sell everything in my country!
It seems that the human body can only eat 96 cuacks Checkmate!
Let Francis.
only 4 more.
You can do it!
I can not.
Killing Cuacks Hey, nobody said he had to eat all cuacks.
They just had to be inside your body Right?
Yes, if it's true You worked.
Where do you Francis?
Hey, I bet David can eat a thousand gut reactions Impossible David is a great guy, But a thousand grains?
Only these delirious Such are the things that make you not recognize that whenever you're wrong.
Oh come on, you're talking about?
Here's your ice cream Carl Karen yours here And here his Lord Miles.
That man left us no choice.
Prees Green!
Lady out of there.
You or they can move this thing!

Do not you dare lie!
Well not want to hear, I'll be rude.
You're out of control monster I see it all the time But guess what?
This is a traffic jam.
It is beyond your control Then you can not send anyone.

There is absolutely nothing you can do.
"Whose dog is this?

It is good to do well from time to time.
A life is a life MÃ­ra how are you eh ..
There is, go home.

We are here on vacation Why do not you tell me?
Because'd gone anyway all day having fun.

It is OK to have fun with something just for a while.

Village Girls "?
!
Are there any girls in town within the school?
Have you killed anyone?
No sir.
But I saw the worst things you can imagine.
Hurry up honey.
One minute mother.
Do you know what you did?
All academics can not exist without the support, predispocisiÃ³n and cooperation of the village community.
The police chief and the mayor sent them reports to the governors.
The fire chief is a supervisor.
And right now, there are girls in psychotic terroritario military.
Not be long in coming us.
What shall we do sir?
They will do what a respected member of society is in a situation like this We will stay calm.
But they are destroying the school!
Well, that's all they make cadet.
I'm afraid this is like a fire oil We have to let it burning inside.
Yes, I forget.
One of the buildings is burning.
So Have you seen any good movies lately?
Well, the last we saw was "Make sleep a pony" Did you see?
No.
The last movie I saw was "The computer was saying shoes' in the cable.
My God!
Carol Russell!
Yes!
I continue making films from Disney.
Me too!
Especially in sight ..
Nidium, the wrist!
It was so cute Did you see the strongest men in the world?
As 50 times.
That thought!
I always wanted that flashlight.
I'm so terrible.
Seriously, this has to stop.
I'm starting to feel bad but also incredibly boring.
My God!
Is that a snake?
Stevie!
Moron.
Snake I asked for this.
I'm so glad we came to dinner.
Me too.
Now I feel much better.
Better?
About you and your family.
What?
!
For Malcolm and Stevie, because they spend much time together and now we've known me feel much better.
Wait a minute.
What do you mean this was not to Let us be friends?
Yes!
No, it was not.
Were checking our level, you wanted to see if we were good enough for your family.
No, no no.
I would not say so.
I do.
Because that's what you're doing.
How dare you?
You can not judge.
You are not so perfect and successful lady.
You are one of the most despicable people I met in my entire life.
Did you know that Russel was a boy Curl Young and won an award?
Not change the subject.
I'm talking to myself here.
You say something and change the subject, that's what you do.
What about you?
Well if something is wrong with me is wrong with me.
Problem solved.
Well, that's weird.
"I hit with my left?
Think Stevie.
Me I give up to self.
Why do not you, Reese?
Damn!
Why no a man give me a moment of Victory?
You have a very serious problem.
"Never has someone shouted your entire life?
Just do not see sense to take out.
Are you kidding?
Many times if you do not cry, do not listen!
Lois, our situation is quite difficult, I have too much negativity.
What situation, you mean Stevie?
He is right!
He is not pretending you're sorry all at the same time.
Why not take all a break?
Heavy forward, get over it.
Let me help you.
Break your bones!
Finally Justice!
I mean, just going to kill him.
Stevie, What the hell are you doing?
You are in many problems, this behavior is totally unacceptable.
We are in a restaurant!
What about you?
Do not try to talk to me.
Expected to get home.
I broke a bone!
Reciver or not Good for you, I knew she was in her blood!
Do not mess!
Excuse me I could calm down Would you mind go to hell?
And absolutely I asked for tea, how is that you are so stupid to forget it?
Kitty.
We have to calm down.
And you you went to the bar leaving me alone How do you think I felt?
Honey, calm down.
And another thing there were 2 people in that bar.
You know, I feel great.
And you have to organize, do not be stupid.
I think everything was destroyed.
I say we are lucky, because a previous time in 1972 we had to bury a fellow.
It's Gordon.
Hey Gordon, are you okay?
What happened?
Francis terrible things, terrible things.
I think I'll homosexual.
Quick, quick!
Well, an interesting dinner.
Stevie overcame evil in this case, Reese.
Her daddy got drunk.
And his mom is totally out of control.
My God!
How many changes!

We explained how to feed other bodies.
It covers diseases cows.
Started because they said using dead cows is fed to other cows.
Basically, the brain becomes in soups with brains.
It is very similar to a disease with cannibals, because they eat brains.
Hey Patty, let me ask.
What is your address?
Northcand 531.
What is your favorite color?
I dunno, I guess blue.
Mine too.
"Hello Patty, address Nortchand 531 and her favorite color is blue, like mine " I can dance with me, let me show you.
All right.
This is embarrassing.
My God you are an angel!
That is a very nice scene.
Why does the dishes?
I do not know, just shut up.
Very good!
Gosh, It was under the bed!
Here it is!

Yes?
So what is it?
Nothing!
Are you going to do a card?
No!
Do you like glitter, Dewey?

Hey, why not pay for dinner and we get benefits?
Are you abusing me because I'm drunk?
Yes.
Hopefully he did.
Okay.
I hope you're proud yourself.
I can not help it!
I do not know what it is.
It's like this man gives some presumption And makes my hair stand on end and I want to tear it down!
I never would fight me and someone.
Of course occasionally yell at others, always that the window of the car is lifted.
I just say "thanks".
Tom, do not give sermons.
I'm saying that Hal would do what he did if I could.
But you can not because you're a coward.
That's my point.

Gosh, this detargente is horrible!
It's a waste to use on cotton shirts.

Yes, I think normal.
Very medieval.

TEENS AND CHILDREN IN ANXIETY Malcolm, I want you to know how proud I am of you.
Admitting you need help is a difficult step.
No, hold your calm and behavior in the teraupeta is difficult, Loyd.
My self esteem is growing!
Well, listen everybody Unfortunately, tomorrow's performance has been canceled.
Instead we go to a recreation of the French attack Agin and Gur followed by a visit to the museum of torture.
And then a pizza.
Is the museum of torture?
That's amazing!
Is there a business to buy?
Sorry, Malcolm.
You can not go.
You have a dentist appointment.
You're lucky not to go.
My brother went last year and had so much blood false fainted.
I think it's time for a better therapy.
A butterfly was in my hand and woke up.
What color was the butterfly?
It was blue and purple, red or orange was not that I remember.
Your dream Malcolm is so quiet so comforting and that's encouraging.
Yes?
If you're starting to relax.
I think I relaxed.
Look healed, but I'll have a relapse when Next semester starts the ballet.
I have good and bad times.
But now, it feels great to be happy.
I'm glad.
I think we've done a lot of progress.
Thank you, Miss Gulvert.
Now I want to myself.
And that could not speak on Tuesday.
What are you doing here?
I knew you would not like.
These things happen, they are family.
Reese does not know what you're doing!
You'll ruin everything!
Relax, it's all planned.
I'm ready to see Reese.
Reese is not here, now I'm David!
You see, I go 10 in a row!
Lois, he has the gift.
Since the end of the war has only been documented Chuza consecutive triple the English bowling.
You know what I mean?
I can just to rub something in face this engrÃ­do of Giffins and small tennis champion.
What are you talking about?
Always assume that your child constamente won the tournament and this one and will go to the White House Dewey take to shut him up to such a time.
Are you ready to close his mouth to such child?
What kind?
Ready.
Hal, you are only doing this to avoid clean the closet.
Not quite.
Come on son.
What happened?
Have you caught?
Where were you?
Hey, you're always angry.
Maybe you need therapy really.
What I need is not all done to lose, Do you know how much trouble we'll get if we get caught?
With Mom, in school, Mom!
Trust me a little, dude.
I did my own research.
Look, I rented the silence of the lambs, seven and the Nutty Professor.
God!
Reese, tell me exactly what you said!
Nope, that's confidential!
Well, what do you prefer?
"Anibalecter or hockey mask?
Malcolm, Reese What do you tell?
Do not blame Reese, blame David.
I regret it at the last moment, but I need this for tonight, I have another appointment with Rebecca.
Okay.
Seven items $ 30.
I have not much money.
The last time cost me 10.
Can you give me a break, right?
I love Eddie, but I am obliged.
And it would be unethical to make exceptions.
You can not do this.
I have to wear the shirt of bowling.
Rebecca loves my bowling shirt!
Francis, I have no money!
Well, then you have no clothes.
You have to pay to be a player.
Look at you!
I remember Francis who cared about their job!
We must put a cap of fabric softener, do you remember Francis?
Remember?
A plug and a half!
Yes, excuse me I have to iron.
I can not believe it!
Yes, I had 3 cds to give me back my Ironing uniform.
I think it's time for someone to teach a lesson.
Siii!
We are going to put a defective shirt.
Or we could put it with linen.
Just follow me.
So my children are emotionally disturbed?
We do not like to use those labels.
I spent a week with Malcolm.
Really?
"A whole week?
Yes, and to be honest I think they are amazing.
There are definitely some issues that you and him should be treated.
Malcolm, Want to show your mother this picture?
No, okay.
I like what I did with my teeth.
There are some things that Malcolm told me I think you should listen.
All right.
I love to hear.
Malcolm later.
Yes, go ahead.
All we want to help.
You're safe here.
Tell the anger.
Yes, tell me about the anger!
When you get angry, repress your feelings and sink me with silence.
Good try try to talk some more.
Continued.
Please.
I like you're more at home and least in the betting.
Well, I guess I'll have to change that as well.
Come on Malcolm, talk about pressure.
Well, I feel you push me too much and not I can fulfill your expectations.
What pressure?
Perhaps no, do not know.
No, no no.
Say, 'What did you say?
Well, you push me too y. ..
What do you mean?
When you press?
All the time!
If not for the task of the school is by voluntary classes that I want.
And after that I have to help Reese with your homework!
That's not pressure!
You know, do not ask to be born to be smart.
We just want you to develop your potential!
That!
That's exactly what I'm talking about!
I tried to stop it!
I said, 'Do not put that in there red shirt, That Fades " But he just laughed.
He said that the pink color was better because is what little girls are weak.
Let's find everywhere, he is hiding somewhere!
Francis No.
Dewey does not matter, even the best also have bad days.
Some might think you've done on purpose.
Hey, Is there something you want me baby?
I never want to do this.
It's boring.
You'd be giving up something that could be a great talent.
Sandlers could be another Champ!
Son, are you willing to give back to your destination?
Yes.
"I can go now?
Well, if you want.
Wait!
Do you throw again for me?
One final Chuza for your dad?
No.
All right.
Sorry.
No, sorry!
I who have to apologize.
No, you only want the best for me, I know!
Sure, we love you!
I love you too.
Another box of Peterson!
This is from the 60s.

No, Dewey, he is a lady.
Shut up!
Sorry lady.
Well, that's enough.
Reese lost a battle, there is no problem.
Sometimes you win and sometimes not.
Yes, and you have no shame because, you worked.
That girl was a better fighter than you without question God made you fall on the platform as a rag!
Hello?
Hold him!
You, afeitale ass!
Mom, I remind you that today is the last day to buy me a ticket plane to go home for my birthday !

But Mom !
Heaven, I'm sorry.
I wish things were different, and came for Thanksgiving and we can not afford now.
Mama, do not know what they do to people here for his birthday !
I removed the clothes, they shave all the hair on your body and then thrown into the pond.
Is that what you want for me?
I am impressed Francis, your stories have improved are at least more credible.
What stories?
When you wanted to come to the party and swore that academy was being terrorized by wild dogs.
Do you ever caught?
Francis I also would like to have you home by your birthday but we can not afford!
Well, I guess I'll have to cope alone, I hope these monsters not notice that my you know!

Your brother was not over, right?
No.
..
Me neither!
You know, the shameful defeat of Reese may have serious consequences for us Will be stronger locking extra hard to prove that is at the top.
You mean we'd have to deal with a Reese more evil than before?
It is very probable.
We can take the beating, but we should not use underwear in case we split our ups and half.
Here comes.
This is the first time I'm glad to be me.
Do not you have something else to look?
I'll give you something to watch.

What happened to me?
I'll tell you what happened.
From the girl that Reese has stopped being the bully school So now, no one is protecting me from people who thinks I'm a smartass without grace, that is, for all.
Well, you're a little sarcastic.
Thanks Dad, I feel better.
It's true.
He's not funny!
I'll go talk to him.
A tough day eh If You know when people get angry with you an apology can fix everything.
Let me give a hypothetical example Suppose hypothetically that I tell a colleague that the head dyes his hair And let's say hypothetically that my partner goes to my boss and told him what I said And following hypothetically my boss sent me to the small office at the end of the hallway next to the photocopier.
But if it would all be apologizing now in an appropriate office.
Or do you wish I be excused?
In no way are stupid or what!
Look, this scenario has not to do with it.
Just think about it.
Well, I'll be there at eight o'clock.

I just want to talk.
What?
I just want to say I'm sorry.
About what?
Remember the day it was raining and said "Hey, it's raining" and I said "Thanks Einstein" Yes, why did you say that?
My name is not Einstein.
I was referring to Albert Einstein was a physicist who was a genius.
And you think I'm a genius?
Heavens, I find a lot of jokes there but I have to change!
No, I was being sarcastic, I was saying you were the opposite a genius.
So you were calling me stupid?
Yes, and that is why I I'm glad we talked Malcolm.
Yes, I also feel better.
Malcolm Hey, come here!
Finally I discovered, I found the answer, I know what I do with my life.
Do you sell these games yet?
Yes, $ 5.
What are you doing?
Sell my possessions.
Why?
!
Because Billy's brother recommended it to me.
Is the brother Billy?
You mean that crazy going on a school bus leafleting?
Called manifest.

He and his followers have an amazing house in Orehon while living on earth.
Do not you mean to him?
Do not worry, it's totally safe.
There are guard dogs, watchtowers Mom and Dad know about this?
No, you can not tell.
Billy's brother says they have power negative and bad karma.
You're talking about joining a cult!
Are you crazy?
Billy's brother never talks to me and makes me feel good about myself.
It's called brainwashing Reese.
My name is not Reese.
And what is it?
I do not remember, but it's not Reese!
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to distribute manifestos.

I wear boxers.
Really?
Maybe soon you think you need more space But I'll tell you, you are too optimistic.
Just for once I would not have to suppress a childhood memory.
Do not you think Dewey is somewhat old to playing with stuffed animals?
Maybe I should start gradually forget Sunday.
I guess that part of childhood is over.
It's so sad Our little one is growing.
Give me that.

You will not have to be afraid.
What are you talking about?
The torture to which you submitted it ended.
What torture?
Vamos!
I broke the tray of food.
When I broke the tips of the pencils.
When you sneeze and no one said "health".
I still feel bad about it.
Now that took your place our pent-up anger is going to go against it.
You know, the massacres and torture you throughout the school Why do you want to do that to someone else?
Do not even know, maybe it's nice.
Hi, Malcolm.
-Cindy.
So are you new here?
Yes.
My dad wanted to get out of Manhattan, but I think the real reason is that my mother has remarried and is quite hard And he thinks a new environment will help the truth is Nothing is the same since my brother died in a boating accident.
Just kidding!
What?
Consiganse a room Anyway See you later.
And I'm glad that your brother is okay.
I have no brother.
Cadets Apparently one of you had the compulsion to to take my stud Baker of 37 'for a walk in a corn field Can be sure that the head is to be punished harshly.
I know that I ordered last night excursions painful by swamp full of leeches Or the operation to dig ditches and then filling them etc etc etc ..
But things have changed Thanks to a criminal conviction on corporal punishment justice can return and take me out of retirement a. ..
The old Jicory Are hungry for the meat insolent Hi Dad!

Think you need to specify?
I mean, you have to do this for me.
I will not lie for you!
All right.
I want my payment!
What do I pay?
You know, that for once in a lifetime, I just ask and you do not need to ask.

How are you?
Well just to get a good grade in history.
Great!
It takes a long time to get into trouble, things may be starting to change.
So Salts Why so late?
I had to use the computer And you why salt so late?
I liked what you said in class about search for intelligent life in the universe.
And I waited here just to tell me that?
You know, I was thinking, "Why bother to look for life on space?
If we make contact with aliens probably end up taking care of your laundry.
Just kidding.
So, how does it feel to have siblings?
I do not know Well, I have to go home, bye.
Goodbye.
What happens?
A new rare girl school, followed me home!
Really?
Is it pretty?
What does that have to do with the boxers?
Mom, please do not!
Hello!
Thanks again for inviting me.
No, nothing!
If my son was not an unpardonable rude I would have invited itself.
Be good to her She obviously has no friends at all.
Malcolm, could you ask your girlfriend to pass me the potatoes?
Malcolm, could you thank your girlfriend?
So Cindy, you're the kind of Malcolm.
Yes.
Malcolm Could you ask your girlfriend if you want more lentils?
You've spoken!
Thank you, Mr. Chicken, for giving his life for I keep on living.

Hello?
I'm the commander Spangler, academia Marlon.
Yes.
Sorry to bother you but we had an incident to last week and have done a thorough investigation And it seems that his son, Francis, is the prime suspect.
Well that's impossible because he was with me last weekend.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, we went fishing.
Are you sure?
Amazing, do not know how to fight, I have fish as test Do not you want to send you some?
No, okay.

Well, where is Sunday?
Come on, I can smell it!
Honey Think you just want to take off to Sunday because I'm cruel?
Absolutely.
Dewey The reason why I want you out that Teddy is because is very dirty It's full of germs and you could get sick.
He would not do that I want.
Are Germs love.
They are small bugs that bring diseases and Sunday has many.
When you play they get on your hands and What if after you touch your eyes?
I tell you what would happen The germs would get into them and infect And I infirmaries much and end your optic nerve you and your eyes Cairi rot.
So If you want to keep Sunday, you can But if you want to continue with his eyes you should give it to me.
You made a wise decision, dear.
To rest.
Hi Malcolm.
I wanted to sit alone Yes, hello Decided that we will be lab partners.
Cintia know spend much time with me Maybe it would be good look for other friendships.
This seems a good idea We get along so well that even some among us might arise.
Anything?
Malcolm "Having lunch with your girlfriend?
She is not my girlfriend.
I do not know.
I saw how you look Please do not touch me.
Yes, and you know it!
He does not like to be touched.

Are you going to put them in the freezer?
Just for tonight, tomorrow I will send them by mail.
Dewey what are you doing?
Killing germs, I hate germs, scary!
Do not forget the seeds in the oven.
Hello?
You're the best dad ever!
I am not!
I am a terrible parent!
Should never have lied to you.
Well, the important thing is that all this happened and I learned the lesson.
What lesson are you talking about?
That you're the best dad ever!
Francis You know, I have no desire to talk about it.
Yeah, yeah ..
Col.
Spangler, says the father of Francis I fear I lied Francis is responsible for the cadet that destroyed his car.
I see.
Well this puts me in a somewhat compromised.
The culprit is being punished as we speak.
But Francis did, you're punishing the wrong cadet.
Excuse me like that?
In my 30 years in academia I have never beaten Cadet wrong.
Excuse me, said "whip"?
No.
But sir Consider the case closed.
But sir You should take 5, comrades.
Yes, we are having lunch together.
So what?
She likes to sit with me.
For these two are having a conversation quite interesting.
Did you know that I can read lips?
I'm impressed!
"I can kiss you?
I was hoping you ask me!
Let me finish my sandwich first.
The wait is sweet agony.
Well, I'm ready.
I do not, I just bite my sandwich!
You're a fool!
Well, if pressed for 10 seconds and you faint.
If I do it for 20 seconds you will die of a brain hemorrhage.
Great.
Okay.
Are you wearing perfume?
It's my shampoo.
Jasmine, do you like?
If it smells good.
They say it removes dandruff, but I'm not sure, look What do you think?
"Malcolm?
It seems the Cintia and you have created a real chemistry.
Shut up!
No, you see, is a pun I said shut up!
I'll send it by mail And other things if you do not mind.
So discover how many words are formed with your phone number?
In my five.
Just kidding.
If you tell a joke you do not have to say "Just kidding" Or is it funny or not.
Just because you're cute does not mean you have to be rude.
That was not rude that was What demo ?
You said it was cute?
Hi Malcolm, What happened?
I just wanted to talk to someone that is bothering me.
What is it?
There is a girl Keep away from her mom!
What?
I'm warning you!
Keep mom away from your love life!
Mom has nothing to do with it.
Trust me, if you have, it will ruin everything.
I swear.
What mom tells you, do not.
And neither do the opposite.
The way it works with me is It never really works for me.
I do not think that's a good idea.
I've thought about this for a long time.
Well, whatever.
When you're not going to talk to Dewey?
As I finished with the windows Hey!
I want a rematch.
The last time the sun was giving me in the eyes, and I could not Hi Malcolm!
What will you do after school?
We are buying a dog and I want you to help me choose one My mom wants a Golden Retriever but I prefer a plain dog labrador Because everyone has the Golden y. ..
I do not want to be more with you in the lab!
What?
Say It was not my idea The teacher said I have to work with another.
All right.
Hello son.
What are you doing here Dad?
Need to talk.
A journey of eight hours just to talk to me?
I think this is best to talk face to face man to man.
What is it?
Francis, wrecking the car of the commander and not you were punished.
Another cadet it was and not fair.
Did you all this way to tell me that?
Well well And your mother said you could leave the military school and I I told him I did not think it was a good idea.
What?
Francis, neither was right and has to be consequences for that.
Vamos!
Look, if I did this would fallÃ¡ndote as a parent.
There must be another way!
No, no I've been thinking about the whole trip.
This is the only right thing to do because I I was also complicit.
It's all I had to say.
Sounds like you have things to do so I leave here.
Adios.
I love you son.
Have fun.
Dewey, we need to talk.
Baby, when you talked about germs was only trying to scare you That was wrong.
But this is not about germs Honey, it's about growing.
The reason I had to get you to Sunday's because 're too old for that teddy bear that is falling apart!
Dewey, you have to calm down!
It is a small insect, never hurt anyone!
It has many germs!
Well, that's enough.
See?
I have met with nothing.
Well okay then Take off the plastic and go to breakfast.
But anyway Look at him, talking to these idiots!
Who is that?
What am I saying?
I do not care Why should I care?
There is nothing special about her Why should I bother so much?
If I am a genius, you should find a clever way out of this.
Why did you throw a brick at the window of my daughter at 2 am?
I do not know Really do not know.
How could you do that?
I was seriously scared of Malcolm.
I do not know, sorry!
The good news is that mom will kill me before the end of this.
I moved to the suburbs for my daughter is attacked at night.
For the love of God!
There has been an attack, just wanted to meet her!
Excuse me?
Mom, no!
Do not worry Malcolm will be punished but not be afraid.
But Do not you remember when you were their age?
Do all the nonsense that did to their girlfriends?
I'm not your It puberty!
Their bodies go crazy and can not help it!
Starting to be kisses like fools, then excited and as they know do they give for throwing bricks and stuff.
My oldest son set fire to a dog kennel!
They are idiots at this age!
That's all they do.
If good, it could be But this kind of behavior is not acceptable.
No, it is not.
But better get used to it because I'm going to say now This is a small plant In the next 3 years all your cells burst It will be something against it, but do not let that affect you.
You'll be happy when you get to college.
Come on.
I'll give the number of glass companies.
We have given a lot of work, it will be treated well.
At least not stripped us to take pictures.
Do not despair Okay.
You know what?
I do not I really like.
I'm willing to say I really like.
You too me.
Very well then What?
I'm not excited or anything like that, right?
No, me neither.
And my body is not going crazy.
Well.
God!
Why I say that?
Malcolm!
What are you doing?
Cintia, believe me, I'm trying to kiss and if you give me a minute to clear my mind I will be able to kiss you, right?
Excuse me?
Francis said you'd say that And who is this Francis?
Not what you think, is my brother.
Were you going to kiss me thinking about your brother?
No, I was thinking about my mom.
No, I mean I thought in your bra.
No, I was thinking about what's in your bra!
Well I mean ..

Questions?
If your work is so boring and do not like, why do it?
Did you leave your job?

It's drastic, but you do not need to make many questions.
Very good.
Did you do this only by what you said the other child?
It was horrible, did mourn dad!
The boy was rude but fair.
His father gave us a puppet theater.
I'll tell you, life is crazy One day you're in college showing off your stuff but then need money so you get a job Think is only temporary, but then you go up, and then a salary increase and a lot of doors open Except that there are doors, are traps!

Remember this is the one to take it orally.
"Stop pushing me" "Shut Dewey - I was not!
- Hey guys, I'll finish this in 5 minutes and then go the academy of hairdressing.
Why not go to a normal hairdresser?
Because I like to support education.
It's free.
What will make my hair to make a damn Dewey?
Honey We've talked about this.
All the words from the mouth of Reese Are lies, remember?
Well, go get some magazines.
And everything is broken I will deduct their allowance.
Never give us an allowance!
Yes, and you know why.
I will ask the barber to shave me all of this on the other side and nothing It will be a different style for each profile Different for every mood.
How are you?
Not bad And you?
I can not complain.
Are $ 6.24 Sorry.
What?
A total of $ 6 to 24 cents.
Is there a problem?
No, it's just that that Store manager and I have a fix.
I know nothing about that.
I have only $ 3.
Well, you can leave the magazine.
Lois Lois!
I make a discount to the Stockton official.
You know the discount to the police is 100%.
Craig, I can not do that!
But Lois Do not worry about that, fine Greg.
It's Craig.
Are you crazy?
Not sure how this works?
If you scratch your back scratching ours.
If you give away something he fights for us, is called protection.
Craig, we have won 5 times in the last 6 months!
Lois, think of all the places you can get free stuff It can not be everywhere!
Mom really, I will not let the dwarf two fingers cut my hair again.
That's all you need to use scissors, and better to be polite.
These people are very nervous.
What?
!
No I did nothing!
Mom tries to escape, we will have the news!
Well guys, I do not hear a word.
Do not make pig noises, smells or say that baseball nor that they were kidnapped.
Do you?
Driver's license please.
What is this?
I do not respect the crossing signal, to get a car on the avenue a car had to brake.
How does auto mean?
Look left and there was no car!
Lady driver's license.
Well, do not think you do not know why this.
I did it because you pay the iced tea.
Was it you?
Well, now Just stay seated, I have to fill in forms and check the computer and the computer goes slow so it might take.
Well, do what you want, my background is clean.
Hey, there's no way you have 16 unpaid fines!
The computer was wrong!
Do not get away with it.
Hey Mom.
Is it a bad time to tell you I got kicked out of the practice?
I mean, is silly compared to this.
Lois mood, bring the boys home.
I'll wait.
Guys want to be good with Craig.
And Dewey you're not scared.
Mom will be fine.
Can you turn on the siren?
Sure!
Sii!
Come on baby, admit it was an exciting situation.
I had to go to get you out of jail.
It was exciting for me.
If Hal was very exciting to be there thinking about how it would take my children the horrible things would imagine thinking that his mother was in jail.
Mama, Did you get a tattoo?
I do not understand How could you have gotten 16 fines if they do not even know about them?
Mama, just calm down!
I was in prison, Francis!
In jail!
And all because they parked where they should!
How did you get 16 parking tickets?
Not my fault.
I have enclosed here.
When I go home I'm so desperate that I find a place to park.
Listen sir Your irresponsible behavior went too far and you'll suffer the consequences!
You're gonna pay those parking tickets!
Mom, the prison was hard for you.
Francis I'm serious We will return the fines, plus $ 155 we paid for retrieve the car, means that $ 747 and you owe us 13 cents!
That is totally unfair!
None of this would have happened if you were a reckless driver.
Excuse me?
!
When parked near a mailbox, no hurt anyone's life.
I do not hurt anyone!
I was arrested by a corrupt police officer saying he had committed I never committed an offense.
But when I tell you accuse me unjustly send me to military school.
What irony, right?
!
That police had followed me!
Of course, if all chasing you, and the neighbor's cat is the leader of the conspiracy, Did You Know?
You can laugh all you want, Francis.
But unless you come with money, not come home.
Where am I supposed to get $ 700?
You're just using an excuse for blankets here!
If, indeed, was the idea of cat!
Mom, there's no way you can get that Francis amount of money.
But he would have thought Before doing that thing bad bad.
Baby do not worry about it, everything will be fine.
Francis think of something.

And I have three witnesses to prove it!
They saw exactly what happened.
Dewey, Dewey, Dewey Okay mom.

Do you see Hal?
Is a clear case of corruption.
The police run out of tea and invent an offense to take fines.
We will fight for this.
Well, why not think about it baby You know I will be your word with it and the judges always are on the side of the police.
If I already have that.
That's what he thinks will be quit lying.
I will not allow it!
Because I know I have reason.
If you know love, but what happens if something goes wrong?
We can not increase insurance permitirno.
I will not lose!
I'll be right, and finally prove it.
Okay.
If that's what you do, you have our full support.
Remember Mama, in a world of lies, the truth is only weapon.
What?
Is not it?
Thanks.
Hey lady, how was jail?

Should not you be chasing a thief or something?
Yes, I was planning to do that after paying time my iced tea.

Well, here it is: I just sent $ 20 as proof of my good intentions.
Great!
We only have $ 727 so you can come home.

It's nothing, the telephone, I wanted to know some things How about what would happen if I lose?
Well yes Wanted to know what would happen in the worst case.
See if There is nothing of the "see if" Hal!
You're right you are quite right.
And though our insurance will increase and we can not afford two cars, just sell one I mean, people did before cars?
They they walked.
So walk.
What you expect is to lose Is that the way you support me?
If you support but I think we need to know what we're getting into.
I mean is it worth getting into this?
Yes, Hal.
I have to defend what you believe is worthwhile.
I think we get to blame me as worth it!
I'm sure I could win because I know I have right!
I can not believe you have so little faith in me!
I have complete faith in you is the rest of the world to they do not I have faith!
Things may look different to different people.
The system may be corrupt.
Not be in this situation if they did not.
Lois And sometimes, being right is not enough.
Being right it!
Hal No I did nothing wrong, and I really need to try it.
I know it will be difficult.
That's why I need my own family trust me.
How many times do I have to say that I have right?
I have reason.
I swear on my children's lives I have reason!
What do you want?
Nothing.
I can not believe you chickened out!
Me?
You're the one who disappeared!
Now you blame me me!
Look Mom is going to unload their anger to anyone show you the tape.
I do not!
Maybe we could send mail without a destination I do not!
Okay, but I need I do not!

Francis, I can not!
If I show this video mom go crazy!
And then kill the messenger, that's me!
You're asking me to suicide!
Think that will face!
We thought it best to show it to you first.
I can not say I'm glad you have done but I guess they did the right thing.
Then go to show it!
I do not!
Dad!
Agree, but we need to prepare the ground wait for the right time.
This is a very delicate matter.
Hal!
I could swear that that cop was following me all the way home!
Lois We do not believe that you have followed, I'm sure had more important things to do!
What do you think you're doing here?
My commander told me that you asked for my record, to This is so right Decided to do a little walk and give in hand.
Nice house.
Do not try to intimidate me.
All I said was that it has a nice house.

The universe is asking you to give up!
It's time to let go.
Well That's not fair.
You know what it is not fair, Lois?
Having to be right all the time!

Would not it be relief for you admit it?

Now if you'll excuse me someone is calling.
Malcolm 2x17 - Operation * From fans to fans * If you want help with send me a mail subs The tension is raised on the Olympic shaving number 8215 Hal has lost a few crucial seconds with soap, but will mount it with the blade.
This is worth gold!
Hal, boys, breakfast!
Day chops!
Dewey do not panic but there's a spider on your plate!
If Dad always spiders in the days of chops.
You know, I do not feel very well.

It hurts!
Reese Shut up!
Mom ..

Mami!
Well enough is enough.
I do not care for that review did not study or work they did, going to go to school.
You know, now that you mention it Everyone will go!
Lord, what are you doing?
Why is going to take our TV?
It's for your own good cadet.
But that's the only thing that makes this place endure.
Television rots the mind cadet.
How can concentrate on their studies and enhance their character if your brain is full of "sun, the beach vigiliantes?
Now have time for more productive use.
Write letters, I'm sure your recipients will thank you.
Well, that's ridiculous!
I say we should do something!
You're right!
Spangler can not make arbitrary decisions about our lives.
He can not tell us where to go and what to do!
One moment, if you can.
Francis Face it, we are prisoners without rights.
Well, then we are helpless.
But even the defenseless have options!
History is full of people supposedly helpless achieved oppose their oppressors.
What do you mean?
In civil disobedience!
..
Como a hunger strike!
We can do that!
Will not want to starve the children in their care.
Sure it works!
I do not know.
Is not that a bit drastic?
Should we start after dinner?
What do we have?
Meatloaf.
The strike begins now!
Malcolm, why you walk like that?
I still hurts here.
But this is the weekend.
Okay, everyone get on the car!
We go to the hospital!
Mom Why is this man put a bulb in the ?
Dewey!
Stay away from there.
Dad you okay?

I just do not really like hospitals.
They can outfit with flowers and pictures but let's face, this place is a butcher!
Hal!

White blood cells are at 12.2 and those pricks in the side I am afraid it is appendicitis.
Will remain under observation tonight and probably tomorrow it will operate.
Will I be trading?
You do not have to worry.
Not even going to be even a scar.
If I sign these forms, you will enter.
Are you going to open the stomach?
As a trout!
Do not worry you will not feel anything.
You'll be unconscious.
Not exactly.
I saw on TV that guy who woke up while it was operated and what they were doing but I could not scream because he was paralyzed Reese for the love of God, stop talking!
Mom Honey, do not worry.
You'll have your own TV, many people pediente you.
You'll be better than at home.
Why am I in the field of children?
I'm sorry honey but you're 6 months younger to have your own room.
I heard that if you behave yourself you will drink apple juice.
Dad want to wait in the car?
No, I'm fine.
I'm fine.
I'm on a beach.
I see the sand surf there are no bubbles.
There's this horrible plague and penetrating antiseptic hospital !
Hal!
Coming.
Take care of your father at home, you'll be fine.
Get well son!
Reese, embrace your brother.
Mom!
Do it!
If you tell someone to hug you I'll send you back here!
Adios!
Why forced him to hug me?
Wait!
Why did you hug me?

How quiet is here without Malcolm.

On a chop.
It's mine!
Come, I'm full.
Me too.
And me too.
I was waiting for someone to fight for it.
Can we play "March and Conquer"?
This game is not fun!
Malcolm always crushed in 5 minutes.
Yes!
Can we?
I do not know Please.
We have to be 3 at least to play.
All right.
Very good Lois, see how you defend the black sea without matches and the tartanelos.
Yeah, yeah ..

An hour and we're still playing!
Usually I run out before you.
Guess what We are like the family of the box.
If "I can be the girl?
Not while I send child.
Want to play the fish?
No, not want to play for 5 minutes.
I did not want to play in an hour.
Do not want to play!
Do you have a 5?
And this is our inflamed appendix.

How long we do not eat?
God and are serving dinner.
Firm!
I found only in the last meals.
Are we on a diet?
Not a football season.
We are on a hunger strike sir.
We will not eat until we return the TV.
Passive resistance.
This is the last resort of cowards.
What about the Gandinga?
A hen.
This is a fight, sir, we will not surrender until justice.
Well, let's see if I understand.
I'm going to keep eating and you do not.
I already feel the pressure.
Stop It Now Let Mom!
Well, you can do this the easy way and surrender with dignity Or I can destroy you.
Do not forget that I have yet to Antarctica and from there to New Zealand.
You have nothing.
If I can not get a 3, the world is mine.

Hal, are over 12.
Revenge!
Put the board.
Coming.
Here it is.
What?
Just stay quiet, you're in good hands.
So your head does not move and Mr. laser can do its job.
I'm sure it was not too bad.
I did use a potty even though she could walk.
The lights at 7 so I can not read.
And last night a man I put a cage in the head!
I would operate on the brain!
A slump.
Honey, surely it was just a nightmare.
In addition, I feel much better now.
I do not need an operation.
Okay scare all operations.
Believe me, this is going to end before they know it.
Between the smell of sickness and not many waffles I feel great.
What Waffles?
You missed!
We went to breakfast at Pete's We're never going to breakfast.
Well, we stayed up late playing "Run and Conquest" and your mother was too tired to cook.
Did you play a 'march and conquest "without me?
Malcolm you did not miss anything, these guys are a band of bread eaten.
"Bread eaten?
I had the meridian for 3 hours!
Well, let's bring the boys home and then your dad and I back in time to your operation, right?
.
Dewey You're wearing my shirt!
Really?
I'm so hungry!
I think we should leave now.
Guys This hunger strike will only work if we stick together.
We can do it!
Our stomachs were bridged!
The hardest part is over!
Good morning cadets.
I have to say it's refreshing to see a struggling young value for what they believe.
Two whole days, an impressive show of civil disobedience this is the kind stomach strength that can only be rewarded with a large tortilla.
Tempt us with food will not work sir.
Of course not.
These delicious eggs and other ingredients are for me.
Now, this is my dilemma What am I going to put put my tortilla?
Black forest ham, cheese import Or some wild mushrooms.
"Wild?
What the hell ..
?
Give me everything!
There is our comrade down.
I love the room 24!
Your appendix when you take it away ?
Tonight but I do not know I feel better may not need this operation.
What do you mean?

Of course you need the operation!
Pe Do not you understand?

Take advantage of the situation while it lasts!
With angina I had got this watch!
And my testicle Strap gave me a weekend in "Disneyland" I am a step ..
..
to get a "Range Rover" Well you have 2 hours and then have to return to the hospital.
Do you mind eat leftovers?
Prefer is up to you but it would be a piece of cake, right?
What do you mean?
"March and conquer" You called me a piece of cake, not deny it!
Come on baby, crush you.
That's because you got lucky with the dice and did not have the responsibility to protect to Brazil and I would not call it "crush" What do you call?
"Defeat?
"Raze?
"Annihilate?
Bring the board.
How are you tiger?
I want to take note of the patient treatment.
Dr Harrison glad to see me, wanted to talk to you I feel much better, I have no fever since 6 hours I think my first blood tests were not accurate.
This is what we call "a hysterical patient" I'm not hysterical, I just think it would be a good idea I have another test decirdir blood before the body open up!
Well that's a great idea, really great.
See you later.
What's wrong with you?
The labs make mistakes!
Escuchenmee!
Declare war on the country BLUE!
Reese, you attack me Why me?

Just relax until the pills take effect.
Good boy.
Reese's your turn.

Do not Know!
I have hunger.
Reese, if you attack me, I annihilate.
If not attacking, you annihilate.
Just do not want to play anymore, I hate this game!
Never was so horrible!
Even when we crushed Malcolm!
You're right.
Look what we've become.

I feel sorry for us.
So you give up?
Let him and Lois.
You're right.
Reese, do the honors.
Well, Who wants to go see burn the damn game?

My God!
Look to the hospital bill.
I can not imagine what it would cost if they had operated.
I guess vacation goodbye.
What we have to pay that although he was faking?
I was not faking, I was the one who realized that they are wrong, remember?
Well, if you're so smart why do not you find it before?
Well son, Will you answer that?
Nothing like 10 seconds at home to assess the hospital.

Inside.
How long will the punishment?
Just go to your room.

What else can we do?
We remove the television, video games, music, fresh air.
Lois, we have removed the fresh air and did not care anything about that.
Well you better think of something before turn out to be a problem for the state.
Maybe we should interted else in addition to punishment.
Like what?
Maybe Reese needs attention.
Positive attention.
When I was your age I always wanted someone with talk to or be, or be modeled.
I do not know.
Lois, this boy needs a father figure.

But when 300 people do not van is a total humiliation.
Well, I guess many people will be present.

A 18 cm knife and a bread clip.
Amazing.
"I can help?
Hi, Malcolm.
I do not know if you remember me.
Not sure.
I have a vague recollection that threw a brick through the window of my daughter And I think you're the guy who ruined his party and humiliated in a public restroom.
How do I?
Now if you do not mind.
Okay, Dad.
Great, the party is a success Do not you listen?
What are you doing here, Malcolm?
I do not talk in school do not answer my calls.
I just want to say I'm sorry.
Well, you want to ease your guilt?
You are acquitted.
Let me finish.
'm Not telling you the truth.
You were just preparing a major disaster you did your party.
Just wished I had been kinder.
What's so nice to tell someone it is a social delayed?
You see my problem?
But even if you did not say a sappy, 're smart, funny, interesting and friendly and a unique person and if people do not see it, is your problem.
So how did you learn to deal the school will laugh at you?
In the same way with everything.
I pretend I do not mind and bothers people who do not deserve it.
It seems to work.
Want to join?
"I can help?
Yes, we come to the party of Cindy.
We found these at the library.
I just sent uninvited.
I thought you said nobody would come.
Come in, I think.
I believe that truth will win.
I hope to try anything that has been cooked.
Reese, this is the best I've ever tasted Kich.
What gives it that something extra?
Old Spice Lotion hazelnuts before roasting.
"Old Spice?
Yes, I would combine with the ricotta.
Extraordinary.
How much salt did you use?
Just a pinch.
I did not put much salt in it.
Where do you keep the first aid kit?
The language of my husband is swelling like a melon.
I need to go to the bathroom.
I think Cindy was right.
If you invite people to your party, they will come.
Well, it looks fun, but prefer not to have piercings, for a while Girls should get the planetary have a great laser show.
I have a card that allows go to four for the price of three.
Notify me go.
As my grandmother to sleep, I can get away and sit with you.
Are you wearing cologne?
Just me aftershave.
Hi, Steve.
I'm working here.
Can we go please?
Two hours and then we go home.
Francis, the project is due tomorrow.
Do not worry.
It will take eight hours to arrive, we will then Indeed, it is Terri and her sister.
Hello.
I'm Eric.
Go to summer school.
Dewie, go to your room.
But Reese poisoned all these people.
Now!
What happens to you?
I was not allowed to accept my trophy.
I will give him a trophy, sir.
Honey, what the kitchen was my idea.
I'll handle this.
Reese,'ll get you out of class because we know that you cheated.
Would have won easily.
Why did you?
I do not know.
It was fun.
These people worked very hard and you destroyed them.
How would you feel if you were the poor woman Tissue with salt?
Fat?
.
Reese, you know what is empathy?
No.
Empathy is putting yourself in the other to make you feel how they feel.
If you hurt someone, Empathy makes you hurt as well.
So, why would you want empathy?
Has no sense of good and bad that a frog.
What shall we do?
Back to punishment.
How can we punish him if do not mind ?
Son, this is what will happen.
For the next month you do not have to cook meals.
Is that all?
So do not cook.
Big deal.
None of breast Cordon Blue and no cake.
Wait a second.
You said nothing about cooking.
But the cakes are baked.
Without baking, not fried, unsalted.
We can not do that.
Listen to your father.
The stove and accessories are banned for a month.
Please, I'll be good, I promise.
I will do what they say.
Sorry, son.
So it should be.
It worked.
We can control it.
We have a weapon.
Your actions have consequences.
I know.
We hurt.
We can be parents again.
While your steaks have to suffer of pudding a month.
Amen to that.
You know what?
I realized something.
The holidays suck.
The music always sucks the food is bad, And who cares if nobody speaks to you?
People are fake anyway.
- Hello, Malcolm.
- Hi, Cynthia.
Great party.
I love music and dressing.
You know what?
I need that chair.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
Hal!
Are you smoking again?
No!
I'm cleaning, "Do you smell smoke?
No, but I Lois if she wanted a cigarette would not be hiding like a scared teenager.
What would the world view as a man.
It was our third vacuum and is our last cleaner.
Francis did not want to hear any more argument!
You're going to fix the roof!
It is totally unfair, I come home from school and I immediately assign tasks.
Well, someone has to, you know your father was terrified of heights.
Do not panic!
The last time we had change a light bulb to guide him to lower the table.
You're going to do this!
Why not put me in the neck chain and make me sleep in the garage?
!
This is what we call anger level 4 The only way not to be challenged is to avoid sudden movement and eye contact at all costs.
And you think !
Â¿ hide the note, the board Parents and teachers will be canceled?
Mom, the teacher Woodward is against me All your teachers from kindergarten have been against you.
Yes, I know.
It also bothers me.
Why is clogged drain?
Ah, well ..
that ..
is ..
it was a crocodile ..
Was about to do ..
but ..
very funny but, look at that mess is here ..
There is a spot of milk on the table ..
Reese is still looking for a true academic Your attention is fluctuating, the initiative will declining and that prevents potential reaches the maximum.
What?
In other words, Reese is not self-conscious.
Hey, better I give you a topic says "good or bad".
That will help us better.
Reese is failing on almost all subjects From what I've decided to recommend that transferred into the class of slow learners And that's a metaphor Kind of slow learners !
Nooooo!
No, no, no, no No, no this is not an option.
We who strive I wish it were that easy.
Reese will be updated, will even kill him.
I'm glad your level of commitment.
I'm really happy to have this conversation.
Then we can go now.
I do not want to hear any excuses, you sit all night and work up to raise scores.
Why do I have to teach me?
Because God gave you a brain big, Blame him.
"Reese failed and to torment me?
What is the logic in that?
Malcolm I have 0 tolerance for this Mom finally found his courage to express his thoughts.
Why do not you fix that roof?
We are 5 degrees I'll freeze and it will rain.
Therefore you need to shave that roof Maybe if not buy as cheap tiles would not leak all the time.
Francis while in this house will do everything I say.
You know what Mom?
No!
'm Too big to be handled for you.
Our whole life all you've done is make what you want.
You're the boss of the world and we're tired.
This may be your roof but also live here.
We are human beings with rights and therefore I put an end to your reign of terror.
You should see the look on his face but it worked completely.
Sounds like you went wrong Friend, you have no idea.
Thanks I have a shelter near the bus station.
And it is warm and fairly dry.
You can stay there for a while, if that want.
Would you do that for me?
It's a tough world, we have to guard us.
Thanks.

I have no geography!
Of course if you have notes on it.
Ah, that can not be good.
Mi casa es su casa.
May be the home of my parents, but a friend down here is worth everything.
What is that smell?
Could be my socks, my pants could be the rat could be killed.
I think I hurt must have entered into a hole on the wall to die or something.
What is this?
Your bed, you have to inflate.

And down from there.
Hello heaven.
What do you think you're doing?

Oh no, not him.
It is for me.
I wanted fresh air y. ..

Is amazing.
Lois you thinking I'm having fun I spent 2 days on this and I even saw a paragraph that really sucked and then I rewrote it.
Malcolm had never done this before, but last night, I say look I can not stop talking while you try to read.
How about grammar?
Never mind.
Reese ..

Great!
Good job!
You do not say to look good, right?
No this is the best job I've seen do.
If!

I kicked his ass.
"You got another 5?
Mom read that work, not for 5.
So what is this?
We studied 4 hours a night.
You know what?
That's not enough, to study 8 hours per night if that's what it takes to upload your grades.
And it will!
Mom!
I do not see your mom, I'm just a janitor with I'm fine!
I'm fine!
I'm freezing but not heat because justice is on my side.
Mom surrender, surrender and be so sweet.

Brother, nobody will come there for at least 6 hours.
Then do it over a trash can.
And could remove pornography for 5 minutes?
Yes, it is over.
I will put "the girls at the conference" No, no, no more porn!

It is impossible.
Then Reese, today is the big test.
How much you have to get to not go to class slow learner?
Nine!
Guys, it seriously.
But you're an idiot.
You're right.
Yes, the only way to pass the idiot test is if someone does it for the idiot, are you stupid?
Steve established the precedent had the chance But not answered and rest your right therefore it is a mutual agreement.
What do I do?
I can not go to class for slow learners.
Go to the cafeteria Rising up the belt.
Loi Unless perhaps you're right, maybe someone should take the test for you You mean cheat?
Mom can not cheat and kill us is wrong.
And most importantly, Mom will kill us.
Hey we run out of options here, Reese.
They're going to discover No, they will not, do you know why?
.
We have 4 bright minds to help plan it.
You had to appeal to my vanity right?
I am inside.
Sorry, but the honor compels me to report this conversation with the deputy Then the honor to report that requires us to sleep with a sheet of elmo.
Okay I'm inside.
Here is the video-cassettera ordered.
I did not order a video cassettera ..
If you did, check with confidence.

You'd better have removed a 9!
Hey, I'm not calling Francis to work yet?

Think you're going to try something cutting all contact.
He should know ..
that until diculpe is really no reason to call I can not wait to see your expression when realize that as we discovered.
Oh, and we have to discover what, honey?
I will not give You know that I will get to the distance.
I think she likes the tomatoes on their sandwiches.
In the other bag Hal!
A wonderful 9 Malcolm, never would a ridiculous as this.
This I find very disturbing 5 Something stinks He knows that we cheated, we will have to deal separately.
Darni he knows nothing, I'll go talk to him.
Mr. Woodward.
I'm Malcolm's brother Reese.
Oh hi, how are you?
Reese is upset, thinks he deserves more than a 5 on your screen history.
Review and think is not bad.
Believed that there would be another way to have a look.
Malcolm should congratulate you for your fraternity.
But the test is worth 5.
Maybe if Mr. Woodward reviewed again ..
I can not spend much time in Reese, it would be unfair to other students.
But did not deserve a 5 therein.
Malcolm looks have been a teacher long time and I think I know what Reese is capable.
I really do not think it Hey, do not want to hear this about your brother.
But I've known guys like Reese all my life.
They are the ones you throw water to look like you peed your pants.
Point to your legs to play ball and fall to the floor and break your chin ..
And I have to fix with no wires and your teeth are correctly And spent 6 years in orthodontics with the most painful and equipment ever designed embarasoso And that was only because they were not aware of themselves.
It is totally against you Man, only used as an excuse.
It will die when mom finds out.
Reese can not blame him, if he betrayed Mom will know you cheated.
I'm dead!
The 2 following 1, 3 follows 2, 4 is to 3, Something follows something and then we got to 10!
God!
Thank God!
, You're here I feared that would give you the message at work What happened to you?
Hey, how do you want your burger?
Just one second, friend I have it all arranged.
Tell your mom you want to repair the mower and then I'm fooling around y. ..
No, no, no, I will not do that Francis.
Decide soon Hey, this is melting pot cheap.
Maybe you could talk to her, calm her down a bit so you can go home, maybe today ..
Francis please get you to stop in the middle.
What will you leave that wins this round too?
Francis is nothing I can do, you know what is the problem?
You and your mother are exactly alike.
That's a lie.
That's true.
Both are foolish and imcapaces to bow.
So good won.
Congratulations that your prize is If you'll excuse me I have to go, smells like something died here.
Take!
Your father is right man, sometimes you're so stupid.
Sorry, no one wanted to prove so.
I feel that I failed to Reese.
Just do not stop Tony.
So ..
what does this leave us?
I think the best thing is to change it as soon as possible.
Must see this as an opportunity.
Opportunity to be in the kind of silly.
Reese is not what I wanted, but let us not choice.
Mama do not, not the fault of Reese did not deserve a 5 on your screen.
Malcolm already had this discussion.
I saw his test and he did a good job, deserved a 9.
This guy is against I'm sorry you feel that way but you can not blame me the defects of your brother.
Mom this is your test, look at this question ..
What was the cause of the Great Depression?
He replied on Thursday, black, is the correct answer.
No this is a partial response.
To get all the credit should have included the vast overproduction of U.S. Protectionism in foreign markets On credit expansion and speculation in the stock market.
Yes, it would have been the correct answer.
You did not read the answer because that is what I wrote.
"I signed up?
What I noticed!
Reese did and it seems that we all identify with what he is going through.
Did you do this test, no?
You cheated!
"I left for you to cheat?
He put a 5 to something he wrote You if you are against And want to see him removed or fired or whatever they do to the hombresillos who abuse their power.
No need for insults.
Le sugieron we leave things as they are.
Oh no, do not think so!
This is the situation, if you notify the school, then the school will know that Malcolm cheated and ejected.
It threatens me!
It is not a threat.
Just do not think that he gave his son that if he meets for well ..
Reese.
Think you do not sacrifice this one?
Let me explain something to you.
Malcolm would leave the sabar creek without thinking for Reese.
What?
Malcolm would be fine no matter what.
He may go to an expensive university or working in the bureaucracy, but come to management.
Reese is the one that needs to be saved I can not believe it.
No mother can be so cruel to his own son.
Mama please leave me cold and I have again I have hunger.
Please will repair the roof and paint the house, I'll do anything, Mom.
Only dajame enter.
Let me live under one roof I want to be warm.
Mom please.
Maybe we can do something about it.
Stay there Tony, Good evening.
Oh god, look at the size of that thing.
Aaaah, Dewey what is wrong with you?
Run Tony Run!
Why always called Tony?
Goodbye Tony.
I love you.
If it is cold and dangerous.

Two wheels is a motorcycle engine .
Francis never understand has been the perfect guy.
You see, what I'm asking just a glimmer of hope.
Just that.
Francis is interested in learning .
Francis is interested in causing problems I regret having to say it but I have seen people of their kind before.
Everything you like to do is circumvent the authority disregards the rules of the fund To kill and destroy lives, has no qualms And understanding.
Is not there anything positive you can tell me?
Sorry.
Wait.
Yes?
Do you want chicken or fish for today?
Hey Mom, I do not understand how much we like this bike.

Thank you very much anyway.
But of course if you are in place, wash.
Well mom, what we think and understand you worry that it hurts us But I promise to always wear helmets when we drive.
And also the helmet wearing kneepads but laugh at us.
Y. ..
just drive in the park.
And always asking you for permission when you tell us and be with us.
No.
Wait No.
This is not fair!
You can not refuse without a reason.
If I can.
No, you can not.
Because you have reasonable cause to refuse.
There must be some place where let us handle the bike.
Because ..
and if an athlete who carry practicing in a simulator 15 years Without leaving covered with protective of a cotton field Yet think not.
Do not bother me.
I do not know Lois, the boys seem reasonable.
Do not get into it, Craig.
Hey, I live here right?
Mom gets no support because we are united in something.
It's true.
Fixing the bike finally we were happy.
I did not want it to end.
Sure.
We were a perfect team.
Still are.
We 3, we will find a way to overcome it.
We're going to topple.
Hey, wait a minute Guys, I need help.
What is that?
It seems a picture of you and a horse.
Age had masomenos Dewey.
What are you doing with that?
This seems terribly dangerous.
Look at that, without knee, not wearing helmet Do you ever fall?
What should you do with ?
We are asking questions.
So, by your logic, a mini bike from a metro Is more dangerous than riding a horse than 2 feet.
That was long ago.
Before ..
Gravity?
I have no time for that now.
I have to get ready To go to work.
Did you see that?
The baffled!
We did, it worked!

You're an idiot!
Do you have any idea of what you did?
We were so close!
The had!
She was not going to leave but had not caught, I'm not an idiot!
I find it incredible And how was it?
It was amazing, do not know how much fun it was, I reflected with the windows of cars Until I crash with a mailbox.
Sometimes I feel ashamed you're my brother.
All right.
Mom does not have to learn, I'll be fine.
My leg is feeling better.
Let's see.
Hi Mom!
Look guys, I was thinking about this y. ..
And are large enough to deserve an explanation y. ..

I can not even look at you now.
I do not remember if you and I hate or we want but anyway, thank you.
Reese's been 2 hours, inflammation does not go down.
Look, it seems as if was a smiley face.
We really need take you to the hospital.
We can not, Mom will kill us if you learn on the bike.
It's not the bike, we can not do anything for the next 5 years!
There must be some way to take the hospital without her knowledge.
We need to invent an excuse.
Rate me, because I'll start screaming and I have that silenced the next 5 minutes.
There must be some way to go.
Have you seen the toy Joeyvin?

-Francis No, I'm glad you've seen that.
This is what I meant.
Always does the same, despresia my authority Day after day as when ordering a cadet to 100 laps by jumping on the carpet And Francis organized a sit.
Or when I cut the light of the 5th floor a contraband radio cassette And stole a generator for them This guy lives to cause chaos.
He was hugging his dad.
And you before you told me yours without thinking what he might say.
And every time that something like that happens, he defies?
Always.
Even when you know you are going get in trouble?
That does not seem to care at all.
I understand.
I'll see you later.
Dad I want Shut up, son.

We came in 2 seconds.
Maybe we should improvise more.
And Reese How is your leg?
It hurts less when I'm unconscious.
You want something to drink?
Yes!
Sure!
One more thing Do you really believe that he would not see a mini motorcycle crashed into the middle of the park?

They probably even have no motion detectors.
Be honest, son.

You have a hypoallergenic mattress perfectly good here.
Just do not see the point.
Help me feel normal.

Because we want And it's fun What Steve's mom agree with that?
If Maybe, but she has no idea what is messing with you 3 there.

Oh, if Dewey is also going to try think of something to do alone.
Okay guys, have fun.
Adios Oh Hal, we got all night.
Take it heats the roles.
Oh dad would kill me if I caught with one of the employees.

The fact that I have to resort to lies to get me to talk.
That is wrong.

Can we call you later?
Dad and I are a little busy now.
Okay, let me talk to my brothers They are not here.

This sucks.
He just messes with us because we children and can not do anything about it.
I know, this is unfair.
He could let us pass.
But only has an attitude problem.
What happened to customer service?
Are you sure we should do this?
Steve might get angry viniendolo we only see.
We're not doing anything wrong.
We are your parents And results will be in the neighborhood.
You just want to kiss her goodnight.
And what if so?
I gave the kiss of good nights that child since he was born.
That makes me sleep better and sleep better.
What takes so long?
They are boys.
Are probably looking ninjas movies and eating cookies.
Hello!
Is everything okay in there?
We can not pretend that we are here.
They did not see us but probably heard noises.
Oh Kitty, Abe What are you doing here?
Hello Hal!
Is everything okay?
We heard a noise.
Yeah, sure.
We are moving furniture.
What brings you here?
We only came to see Steve.

As in something when I can enforcable Stevie is out alone and scared.
I understand what you feel, Kitty.
I'm worried too.
We are all worried.
Abe, this truck is a palace.

Not as much as you think.
When I bought the DVD player and flat screen monitor gave us free GPS system Steve, Steve, Steve ..
Where the hell is the exit?
We were hanging around here for 20 minutes.
This place is creepy Boys.
We went back where we started.
This is where we got the car.
I can feel the saliva of Dewey.
Ok.
I think we're out of options.
Let's make a bonfire.
Just calm down.
We must find the way out of here.
We need to stick together and hold hands.
Resse give me your hand.
I thought I was holding your hand.
So start all horror movies I've seen.
I think we should separate.
This place is like a graveyard with a wheel of fortune.
Are we in trouble?
No, the last bus leaves in 20 minutes.
We just need to get out and wait.
Hey ask him help No, we get into trouble.
Jumped the fence and get out of here.
The grid measured as 12 feet tall.
What about Steve?
We will in stages.
Climb the chair and then throw, do the same with Steve.
Hello!
The lost brother!
Yes, go ahead Hi, sorry.
But my brother was lost and we get caught here after closing.
You care to open the door and let us out.
We live only a few streets, it will give you more problems.
Do you think the rules do not apply?
Excuse me?
###### Is he mad?
I dunno, looks a bit My God, window defrosters.
I've never seen that before.
Hello!
Francis!
?
Wait, I'll put on the speaker.
Who is it?
Francis, is Mom.
We need to talk.
You know, with the images I have in my brain I think the best thing for me right now Is a short distance and Francis, you could let the antics.
The boys are lost.
What are you talking about?
We are all hoping that you can help us by giving us some ideas of where to find them.
Change Hal!
.
If you can give us some clues, that could really speed up things.
You see, he does not know you finished talking.
No, I put in an awkward position.
You are asking me to betray my brothers.
Francis, we are concerned about the kids.
They will not get into trouble.
Wow, when got new parents?
Listen, little grain, better tell me where they are Before you jump on the phone and you rip your fucking mouth face.
Who is it?
Kenarban my name is Kitty, and my Little Stevie is lost outside.
Your inhaler is running out and have poor night vision.
Wait, Stevie is with them?
Ok, you did not hear from me but checarÃ­a old paint factory.
It's full of paint cans.
Oh and the store at night in the 5th has a back door that is loose.
If Stevie can swim, well I guess They are now 40 miles.
Look, just start with those places.
The others are too alarming and there is no necessary sense of panic.
Happy thoughts, happy thoughts.
Puppies, ice cream, fat people falling.
I think we lost.
Where's Dewey?
My God, where is it?
Look, I see as we go from here.
We can meet to Dewey, he is quiet.
Mom and Dad never know who left.
Do not leave a fallen comrade Shut up.
Would not be in this mess if you had not asked for help.
Keep pushing silly Look, we can find Dewey.
We just need to start on one side of the park to the other and stay away from that duty.
That does not, not that.
We'll stay right here.
The maniac is out there somewhere waiting for us.
Save yourself Man, he has to Stevie.
We must do something.
Why?
Maybe this is your time.
Who are we to judge God?
Reese!
What is taking so long?
In few places kids can hide in a desguesadero.
Auto lights, auto lights Come, come, come on!
Eat my dust!
Stupid dog!
Hal wins again!
They were not there.
How can this be happening?
Steve never usually do things like that.
The is usually a good boy.
He held my fabric and yarn when I held her yarn when the fabric.
He made this sweater.
Kitty I'm so sorry.
This is all because of my children.
They make everyone they have contact criminals.
They are like a virus Look, do not blame your children.
Well, yes.
The thing is that Stevie put his hand on this He has changed.
Since entering high school has become reserved and silent and locks herself in her room.
We should not allow you to have that door.
I guess a few months ahead difficult.
"A few months?
Well, when I grow up and understand the damage we do Then it will be much better at it.
Let's face it, teenagers are reckless and small eating machines.
Dedicated to show us hell and send to an early grave These guys just do not know how much we suffer.
What is that buzzing?
Ah, is massage I put out.
You kids do not know who put I catch a child in wheelchair that skillful Shut up, you were talking when I say Shudder in my chair Do not go anywhere.
I think we should run to the gate and call the police No, we should stay right here This is good This is smart We are exposed, we have to move No, this guy is a psychopath.
He probably should have bodies buried all over the country The fair comes to town, he kills a few residents and packed to go kill some more.
Shut up, we'll be okay.
Look, I just want you to know that Always try to be a good brother And when you hit and all those things I did because you deserved it and it was fun.
But that does not mean it is well Reese please stop talking like that.
We'll be alright.
Be careful.
Hi guys Dewey, this is not funny Where's Stevie?
I grabbed the guard If, locked him in his trailer and he is doing who knows what.
Maybe my friends can help.
What friends?
We come in peace Hello?
I am I talked to Richie.
He has a couple of ideas if they want to hear them.
Francis, change.
First he said that the porn shop is having a window Redford auction Oh yeah and the county fair is in town now.
Okay Of course, fair.
Your friends think they can hide.
I teach a small lesson They already know how to win 6 dollars per hour.
Shut up!
Phil let's be reasonable about it Why not let the little boy go?
Over here, Gorak.
You can not tell me to do.
I'm in charge of security.
I understand that and are doing a fabulous job But guess what I'm asking comes into the category of a favor Can you do me a favor, phil?
Why should you a favor?
You never have made me any favors.
Is this because of the birthday party?
No Phil I said, was trying to be small If you invited had to invite the conseciones rates, the ticket sellers, including carriers.
I could not afford that.
It was nothing personal.
Really?
Look, we'll have a poker game this weekend, why do not you join us?
"I can deliver?
Of course you can divide Thanks for taking care of our children, Gorak.
Hope you do not have caused much trouble.
Hey, I know how they can be children.

Absolutely.
Too bad the children were lost to our show.
The next we're in the city will bring between racks.
Only if you accept our homemade food You got it, lois.
The boys had a night hard not to be harsh.
