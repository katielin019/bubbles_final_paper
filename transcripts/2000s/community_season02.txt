{START OF EPISODE 1}
And we're back.
Welcome, students, new and old , to another fall semester at Greendale.
It's time for clean slates and fresh starts.
Celebrate your fresh start tonight at the Fresh-Start Dance in the cafeteria.
The same cafeteria where Britta Perry professed her love to Jeff Winger who then walked out on her.
Unforgettable.
Plus, free punch and Fresh-Start cookies tonight at the Fresh-Start Dance.
Look at us, living together, driving to school together.
I know, we're like Batman and Shaft.
Batman actually had a guy.
His name was Robin.
He rode around with him.
Troy, Batman's friend didn't have to be Robin, he could've been Shaft, Dolemite, Leroy Brown.
Don't let society limit your people.
"Batman and Shaft," wow.
Reading Troy's Twitter where he posts everything Pierce says?
Yeah, it's hilarious.
Hey.
Hello, Annie.
I like your hair.
Thank you, Abed.
You're welcome.
Jeffrey, hello.
How was your summer?
I live with you.
- How was your summer?
- Great.
- Oh, okay.
- Hey.
- It's good to be back here.
- I know.
Okay.
So you guys ready for whatever Anthropology is?
We should wait for Britta.
Do we know she's coming back?
She never returned my calls or e-mails.
Me neither.
It's not gonna be the same without her.
Did you guys see Toy Story 3?
Yes.
Oh, I loved Toy Story 3.
- It was amazing, I love - Hey!
Whoa!
Oh!
Hey, Toy Story Britta.
How's it going?
Okay, yeah, yeah.
I made an ass of myself and Jeff at that dance.
I was caught up in a competition with his ex-girlfriend, and I wish I could erase the entire night.
And I owe you an apology.
I accept.
You don't owe us anything and you don't have to hide from us.
You?
I'm hiding from them.
It's like high school all over again.
Psycho Britta, the walking freak show for every Barbie with a Cosmo subscription.
I don't mean to be a tool, but you embarrassed me too, so call it karma.
Boy, I hope I'm not around when you do mean to be a tool.
Let's just put this behind us and just walk to class, okay?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're Britta Perry?
Yeah, what's it to you?
You're the coolest.
Right.
Um At what exactly?
Being fearless, honest, speaking from your heart.
"Jeff Winger, I love you".
Right.
My heart may have overstated Do you sign stuff?
- Now and again.
- Awesome.
I don't like where that's going.
I know, right?
Look, um, remember the little talk we had?
The one about discretion?
Yes.
Stop that.
We agreed you and I kissing was a mistake.
If anyone were to find out, I would be tarred, feathered, and put on websites people check when buying a house.
It's forgotten, Jeff, jeez.
I'm not some love-struck teenybopper.
But we didn't just kiss, we Frenched.
I checked the make-out meter in this month's issue of National Review.
I don't like where that's going.
Señor Chang.
Oh, wait, I guess it's not señor anymore.
What should we call you?
Student Chang?
Two-Credits-Into- a-Music-Major Chang?
How about not calling me anything?
Why are you guys in this class?
We chose it together.
The real question is, why are you in it?
Oh, you missed us?
Don't flatter yourself.
Have you checked the course description?
Ancient weaponry.
Genital mutilation.
This subject's talking my Chang-uage.
Ugh.
I don't get it.
Star-Burns has grown reliant on his sideburns but craves identity beyond them, so he added a hat.
No, what's up with Britta mania?
Oh, that's even simpler.
Britta put herself out there and you walked away, making her the underdog, the Aniston.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah.
Have any hillbilly cousins?
I wish, why?
A wealthy uncle, or buddy that may have had a sex change?
Why are you mining my life for sitcom scenarios?
I'm excited about the year, looking to improve.
I'm hoping we can move away from the relationship-y stuff into fast-paced escapades.
What is it exactly that separates man from animal?
Divorce.
Tools.
Like this blowgun I used to hunt monkeys with the Korubo in the Amazon.
My name is Professor June Bauer, and this semester I will guide you to the threshold of your humanity where you will lock eyes with the shrieking, blood-drenched, sister-raping beasts from which we sprang.
You will also have to make a diorama.
For your first assignment, I would like you to form tribes of no more than eight, and if you can, mix up the races.
You'll be surprised at how quickly things get awkward.
Now that Troy's off the streets and living with me, he's learning about the world.
Yeah.
Tell me again why Jewish people wear yarmulkes.
Half a hat, saves money.
Thank you.
"Half a hat"?
That is so offensive.
I love Old White Man Says.
Find an eighth dork for your tribe of dorks?
I think you took Anthropology because you wanna be in our group but are too proud to ask.
Keep dreaming, Winger.
Would somebody with too much pride do this?
Current balance: $23.20.
Consider yourself Chang'd.
Mac and cheese, please.
Sorry, looks like your food just walked out on you.
Same way you did Britta.
Hey, can we talk?
Oh, now he wants to talk.
No, it's fine, I'll be right back.
Man, you got some passionate fans.
Eh.
It'll blow over.
Well, would you mind helping it blow over?
My stock is kind of plummeting around here.
Oh, I don't mean to sound like a tool, but maybe it's karma.
I know you're excited to be popular with women, but don't get too high on your own drama.
High on my own drama?
!
The people's champion.
Sorry, man, I gotta go where the heat is.
Jeff Winger, you're a jerk.
She's turned every woman against me.
Not every woman, not the one that deserves to be with you.
All women deserve to be with me, and vice versa.
Granted, but who doesn't eventually settle down?
I don't, and I never will.
And if I did If I did, I could beat Britta at her own game.
Oh, good.
Yeah, you better take a hike.
Do you know where the cleanest bathroom is?
Teacher's lounge.
Thank you.
Don't be shy, come on up, have a sip.
The yogi of India swear by its restorative powers.
Okay, more of my urine for me.
Now for your tribe's assignment.
This box contains nine different tools, all of them important to humanity's survival.
One of them is the most important of all.
Your tribe's assignment for tomorrow is to tell me which tool that is.
Questions?
I have a question.
But not for you.
It's for Britta.
Britta.
I love you.
I know this puts you in an awkwardly powerful position, but I have to know, right now, in front of everyone, do you love me too?
More than anything in the world.
Really?
Yeah.
So it begins.
Hmm.
The greatest relationship ever known.
This is making me sick.
I'm gonna love you forever.
Good, I'm gonna love you forever.
- I don't believe you.
- Why, don't you want me to?
No, I do.
Bring it.
Doesn't it make you wanna cry?
Something like that.
Excuse me.
I downloaded a song that makes me think of you.
Let's listen to it, each using one ear bud.
Would you consider spinning off with me?
We could open a hair salon.
I don't understand.
Is this you being meta?
I wanted to come out having adventures, like paintball.
This is boring.
- That's selfish, Abed.
- If you were a friend, you would see their relationship as an adventure.
I hadn't thought about it that way.
Oh!
Look at how they walk.
Clearly, the most important tool is the cross, representing Christianity.
It's an ax.
It's an ax?
Maybe the telescope.
Look through it backwards, shrink your enemies.
I'll show you the tool that's most important to our survival, but fair warning, it's my penis.
Old White Man.
Sorry I'm late.
I was in my car loving Britta.
I just love you too much.
Not half as much as me.
Aww.
Do you think you'll marry Britta?
I'd like to see someone stop me.
I just peed a little.
Then here, propose.
Oh.
I got it, I got it, got it.
Jeff Winger, will you marry me?
Yeah, of course.
No problem.
No problem.
Perfect, I'll be right back.
Thank the Lord.
I was so worried about your souls, ever since you had pre-marital sex on the table.
Oh!
Awesome.
You told Shirley?
No need for secrecy now.
It was during the paintball game.
Was there anything you didn't win that day?
Oh, my God!
You slept with her and then kissed me?
What?
# Now they're in so deep # # You know she's such a fool for him # # She has a ring around her finger # # And Abed hired an Irish singer # # Britta's marrying, Britta's marrying Britta's marrying Jeffrey Winger ## What the hell is this?
A wedding episode.
Abed, there's no wedding.
Cold feet?
Talk with your best man, George Clooney.
What's up?
He's an impersonator.
But still razzle-dazzle, right?
Abed.
Hmm?
Jeff made out with Annie.
What?
When?
Where?
Yeah, where?
That's inappropriate.
I'm assuming on the mouth.
After the Transfer Dance.
I tell you that I love you, then you go and stick your tongue into a teenager?
What is wrong with you, Jeffrey?
Shirley, since you have clearly failed to grasp the central insipid metaphor of those Twilight books you devour, let me explain it to you.
Men are monsters who crave young flesh, the end.
At least we have the decency to keep it a secret.
Instead of blurting "I love you" to everyone who sleeps with us.
Oh, please, I never loved you.
Ah-ha!
I win, I win, I win.
In your face.
So this was all a game?
Everything they do is some sick competition.
Like you hate competition.
How long did it take you to kiss Jeff after I told him I loved him?
First Vaughn, now Jeff.
I better not smile at that wall outlet or you'll fry your tongue off!
Way to hog all the girls.
When there's three doughnuts, don't eat one and lick another.
Anyone object to us being referred to as doughnuts?
Sorry we can't all be as honorable as you and post Pierce quotes all day on Twitter.
Wow, is that your lame attempt to try and pass the hot seat to me?
Nice try.
Wait, I'm Old White Man Says?
No wonder he says everything I'm thinking.
You bastard.
I'm just sharing what you say.
Yeah, well, what if I shared all the stuff you say?
He thinks all dogs are boys and all cats are girls.
There's no way to disprove that.
Have you ever seen a cat penis?
Where you going?
By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you canceled.
Oh, good.
Yeah, Abed, cancel us.
Why don't you take your cutesy "I can't tell life from TV" gimmick with you?
You know, it's very "season one".
I can tell life from TV, Jeff.
TV makes sense, it has structure, logic, rules, and likable leading men.
In life, we have this.
We have you.
Ahem.
I'm on the clock for another hour if you want me to do some Batman lines.
Not sitting with your little group?
The group is done.
Yeah, well, missionary accomplished, right?
What does that mean?
Come on, I know you and Britta did it.
Isn't the reason you got with those people because you wanted to bang the blond?
Now I hear that you Frenched the brunette.
What more could you have gotten out of that group?
Good morning, class.
Let's dive in and hear the results of your assignment.
Who wants to go first?
I don't know, Mr. Winger, the last time I called on you, I kind of got what the Maku-Maku call "dirt-roaded".
Using it.
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Come on up.
It was a trick question.
The tool most important to humanity's survival wasn't any of the nine in the box.
Go on.
The most important tool is respect.
Ha!
Gay.
And the reason I know respect is a tool is because it is clearly not a natural thing and we forget to use it all the time.
And then we start competing with each other, exploiting each other, humiliating each other and controlling each other.
And we lose each other.
And without each other, we'll go extinct.
And that's a fact.
Heh.
A gay fact.
That's my answer, professor.
Hmm.
Well, that's one answer.
Here's the one I had in mind.
Combining all nine tools, you get this, a deadlier weapon than any one item in the box.
So I'm gonna use this to attack you, and you use respect to defend yourself.
Uh Oh Uh - Oh, my God.
- Jeffrey.
I respect you.
That's why you fail.
- Oh, my God.
- Jeffrey.
He's passing out.
Stay with us, buddy.
Hello.
Oh, thank God.
What happened?
Professor Bauer got suspended, and we got an A on our assignment.
Did someone throw urine in my face?
I surprise myself under pressure.
Jeff, about the assignment, we decided you had the right answer.
We need more respect and a little less passion.
Which will be easy because I think you're gross now.
Awesome.
I'm gonna delete that Twitter account.
Your friendship is more important than 600,000 strangers.
Whoa, whoa.
Are you saying 600,000 people read what I say on Twitter?
Well, we gotta cash in on that.
How about Old White Man Says, the TV Show?
- No.
- Who would watch that?
Speaking of bad development strategy, I owe you an apology.
I was trying so hard to make our week great, I didn't realize something great.
An old woman drinking her own pee.
You're right.
That's true.
Guys?
I took Anthropology because I wanna be a part of your study group.
Now I gotta do the honest thing and just ask.
Is there any room in this pocket for a little spare Chang?
Uh Look, we've been through a lot today.
Give us a little time to think it over.
Totally, man.
Just think about it.
Take your time and let me know.
Bye.
See you, Chang.
Bye.
Aww.
Poor guy.
We'll let him in eventually.
Says who?
We have the strength to survive anything.
What's the worst that can happen?
Yeah, that's true.
Good point.
I told you they hate you.
No, they said they just needed more time.
Time?
They destroyed your life.
How much time before we take revenge?
But they're my friends.
I'm your only friend.
No.
No.
No!

{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Why is everyone wearing those hats?
Is the dean planning another event, or is the Greendale Hat Club struggling to be noteworthy?
You're talking about it.
I talk about stuff that annoys me.
Speaking of the dean Guten Tag, homies.
I hope you'll all be attending Oktoberfest.
Don't often get to celebrate German culture.
It's not often we want to.
Yeah, a little goes a long way.
True, Greendale's Oktoberfest has never drawn huge crowds, probably due to our diversity, so this year, we are adding some color.
Kick it.
I'm gonna give this to you, Troy.
"Pop and Locktoberfest".
The central event will be a pop-and-Iock-a-thon.
Winner gets to annex Poland.
Kidding.
The winner gets an iTunes gift card.
Okay.
Oh, a break dance contest.
What should we name our team?
Gonna go hang myself in my closet.
I'm coming with.
Is it me, or is this campus getting more cartoonish every day?
It's exciting.
I painted a tunnel on the library.
When it dries, I'm going for it.
See that guy over there?
The one wearing the Gucci suit in a lightweight woven wool-mohair?
We used to work together.
Cool.
So he's from your origins?
This is all I need.
Excuse me, sir.
You're all my friend needs.
Your mouth isn't curved upwards.
Did I misread something?
Aw, Tango?
Sundance.
We worked with different partners.
Got it.
Hey.
What brings you to Greendale?
I'm a teacher.
Wait, that's worse than the truth.
I'm a student.
Hey, I'm in no position to judge.
I'm here for an NA meeting.
Narcotics Anonymous?
Remember when you asked for my secret, I said yoga?
I lied.
I'm Abed.
Abed, this is Alan Connor.
This guy and I used to wipe the courtroom floor with prosecutors.
DA called us The Litterbugs, we put so much trash back out on the street.
Come here, come here.
You still ticklish?
Stop that.
Hey, let's get a drink, huh?
Are you allowed?
Yeah, I quit doing blow, not being rad.
All right, let's do it.
Jeff can't go.
He has class.
Well, those cargo pants would suggest otherwise.
Heh, heh.
What has this place done to you?
You have no idea.
Hat Club.
Now you have some idea.
So?
So?
Anyone that's been in a team pop-and-Iock-a-thon knows you need seven people to stand a chance.
- We have seven.
- Oh, do you?
Word on campus is Winger's too busy hanging with his cool lawyer friend.
Slow news day.
That's your Carson?
Jon Stewart.
You depress me.
Look, we'll get back to you.
All right, well, don't take too long.
And don't rip off this exit.
Where is Jeff?
Obviously hanging with Alan.
Those two are like Siamese twins attached at the cell phone holster.
I haven't met him yet.
Shouldn't we be happy that Jeff found an old friend?
Alan is to Jeff what Rob Lowe is to James Spader in 1990's Bad Influence.
He's a bad influence.
You saw it?
Hey, guys, I'm gonna be a little bit late today.
Alan and I are gonna take a quick sidebar.
Or any bar.
Oh, he's got Britta down.
You look familiar.
It's possible.
Have you or someone you know been injured at work?
Oh.
Yes, a shrimp boat ran over my cousin.
That's serious.
Call me.
Jeff, you need to be respectful of our time.
Shirley, if I killed a man, as a Christian, would you forgive me?
I would.
Then either that man's life is worth less than your time, or it's okay for me to be late.
Ha, ha.
Oh, no.
You've still got the moves, man.
If they gave away awards for mind games, the statue would be Jeff Winger doing it to a brain.
Come on, Jeff's bush-league.
I gave seminars on manipulation.
I can reach into a man's soul and unravel it with one tug.
Cool.
Hit me.
You're bald.
So are you.
I'll kill you, you!
Come here.
Mistrial.
Ha, ha, ha.
Come on, man.
I have hair.
Father, I have hair.
On a tax evasion case?
Yeah.
God, I miss talking about this stuff.
You should visit the office.
Right.
I can't show my face there after getting busted like that.
Jeff, you know what lawyers call someone who defrauds the state bar, cheats on his LSATs and cons his way into a firm?
Best lawyer ever.
Seriously?
Hey, tomorrow night.
Office party.
You're my guest.
Oh, no.
Come on, you just said you missed it.
I do.
I really, really do.
What does Alan have that we don't?
A butt for Jeff's wiener.
Heh.
I mean, we all have butts too.
We have butts, just not for the same thing.
I'm trying to say they're gay.
I don't like how much drinking and carousing they do.
It's a gateway to narcotics.
Narcotics!
I know how I know Alan.
But I'm not allowed to say.
Which means that you met him in Narcotics Anonymous.
Why bring it up if you're not allowed?
Because He said something at a meeting about something bad he did.
He might have done it to Jeff, but I can't say what it is.
Okay, you've gone from precious to annoying.
What if you don't say it, but we guess?
Like charades?
With this group, I'm watching.
Four words.
"Alan got Jeff disbarred".
Uh Those junkies weren't thinking about rules when they were shooting up scag.
Jeff, Alan narced on you.
"Narced"?
Hm.
But he's, like, way too primo for that, Frank Zappa.
I think he turned you in to the state bar.
I was in NA and he bragged about it.
He doesn't recognize me because my hair's longer, my skin's clearer - I've lost a lot of weight - Annie.
He said he turned me in?
He said he sent an e-mail that got a rival co-worker fired around the time you got caught.
They never covered this on Yo Gabba Gabba, but that's circumstantial.
Any other meaningless conspiracy theories?
Yes.
Did you know that Go-Gurt is just yogurt?
Know what a therapist calls this kind of relationship?
A gold mine.
Codependent.
You guys don't want me to be happy.
You want me to need you.
It's getting claustrophobic.
I used to run full-speed through the boundless wilderness and now I'm in the zoo where the horizon is wallpaper and the air is stale and nothing is ever at stake.
In other words, we're not cool.
I never said that.
You may have heard it.
I may have thought it.
It may be true.
But I never said it.
See you at the pop-and-Iock-a-thon?
No, Abed, I'm going to a cool party at my cool former law firm from when my life was cool.
Fine, you can be on the team.
New deal.
If we win, I get to be in the study group.
The stakes have never been higher.
Just want to thank everybody for coming.
You know, when I became a lawyer, I had a dream.
I had a dream that one day I'd be head of a firm so nobody would be able to talk about the big, weird hole in my hand.
Everybody talks about it behind my back.
That's okay.
You know, I would.
What's great, though, is that you don't stare or ask any questions.
And as a reward for your restraint, I got a little something for you.
There.
That ought to keep you going till Christmas.
Everybody have fun tonight.
Anyone else with that hand would wear a glove.
He controls a room with it.
He's the master.
Well, he sure is a fan of yours.
Oh, um Hey, when you talk to him, will you mention me?
He keeps passing me over for partner.
Alan, did you invite me here with an ulterior motive?
God, I miss this place.
God, it's a sea of Wingers.
This whole place reeks of moral ambiguity.
Actually, that was me.
I apologize.
Now, you guys are new to high society, so just follow my lead and you'll be fine.
First, why are you here?
Second, I don't care.
Leave.
As a matter of fact, Jeff, we were invited.
Why would anyone do that?
Hey, you guys made it.
Come on in.
Before this gets more embarrassing, what is your misguided plan?
To apologize to you for casting aspersions on your friend.
- And to show you we can be cool.
- Hey, is that Jeff Winger?
Find Annie and leave.
Ted.
Hey, man.
What's going on?
Wow, hey.
Once Annie gets Alan's office number, you break into his office.
Hack into his e-mails and find proof that he screwed Jeff over.
Fourth floor, 470.
First he said it was 69.
I wanna rub Purell on my brain.
You are so missed here.
If we had five guys with your balls, we wouldn't need 30 lawyers.
True, but we'd need a good doctor.
Ted, stop hitting on my date.
Ha, ha, ha.
I'm kidding.
We can share.
Ha, ha, ha.
I get the head.
I love the brain in there.
Ow, ow, ow.
I'll eat it.
- Hey, everybody, Jeff Winger's here.
- Hey.
Should we notify someone that our team is not gonna make it to the pop-and-Iock-a-thon?
You actually think anybody cares?
Checking in for the Heather Pop-and-Locklears?
Okay.
And where's the rest of your team?
They'll be here.
You're allowed to start by yourself.
But you won't stand a chance without someone They'll be here.
I brought stuff people use for capers.
Suction cup.
Credit card.
Chloroform.
The credit card doesn't work, the chloroform does.
Annie, go back and keep lookout.
Why me, lookout?
Why not you guys?
If someone comes up, Kanye and Kumar get taken to jail.
You get taken to dinner.
You guys, I'm the smartest one in this whole group and all I've been used for is bait and distraction.
Ugh!
Go on your stupid mission.
I hope it sucks.
What did she say?
I don't know.
All I heard was "suck".
I'm surprised Alan hasn't made partner.
I'm surprised I haven't fired him.
Why?
He's got a better win record than I do.
He's a spineless trust fund jag off.
I'll tell you what, Jeff.
You're the best liar I ever employed.
If you can look me in the eye and tell me you actually like Alan, I'll make him a full partner.
Well, I only ever really liked one person.
My mom.
And she liked my dad.
And after all the dust and the custody was settled, the guy I really admired Not liked, admired.
- Was the lawyer leaving the courthouse in the great-Iooking suit and a sky-blue Mercedes SLK.
Sweet ride.
Sweet job.
Sweet life.
He didn't care.
He couldn't care.
And the less he cared, the better he was.
We are a special breed because we rise above the sloppy stuff and look at the bottom line.
You wanna like your employees?
Open a hair salon.
You wanna win?
Make Alan partner.
The student has become the master.
Thank you, Jeff.
You make me wanna be a worse man.
Just because you can't work cases doesn't mean you can't work.
Be a consultant.
Ted, that would be amazing.
I'll be right back.
Hey, Jeff, I'm sure you know Philip.
Did you know that if I sleep with Philip once a month, I can use his beach house in Rio whenever I want?
Wow, you guys are really onto something.
I think you've found the world's newest profession.
Guys, guys.
I actually have a civil case against that bitch that stole my husband.
Don't sue a stripper.
Why not?
She's a stripper.
Life sued her and she lost.
Where's Pierce?
Jeez, why am I even worried about him?
Hey.
Did you know there's an island in Indonesia where you can hunt people?
We need to talk.
I think this is it.
Print it.
- Nice.
- Excuse me.
Who are you guys?
This is not your office.
I can explain.
Let me explain.
Oh, my God.
I didn't know what to do.
Oh, my God.
I usually have one foot out of reality.
Even I'm freaking out right now.
You chloroformed the janitor?
Stop yelling!
You got caught!
You're the one yelling.
We're in trouble.
We have to do something.
I don't know what to do.
My whole brain is crying.
Guys, guys, guys.
Hey, hey.
I have an idea.
Okay, it may sound a little weird, but trust me.
What's happening?
Oh.
We all got chloroformed.
Somebody chloroformed all of us.
And now we're regaining consciousness together.
I don't understand.
Who is she?
Why is she holding a rag?
That was the worst idea ever.
Can we run away now?
Yeah.
Sorry.
It is the fourth straight hour and Ben Chang is still on his own.
One can only imagine what is driving him to push himself to such limits.
My body hurts.
My body hurts.
Are you jealous because we were fitting in with your cool friends?
No, I'm distracted watching you mutate.
Britta, you're not a whore.
Shirley, Jesus turned the other cheek.
He didn't garnish wages.
Pierce, do I even need to say this?
It is bad to hunt man for sport.
Badass.
This is the e-mail that Alan sent the bar association.
He stabbed you in the back, Jeff.
He's a bad friend.
You're right.
He's a bad friend.
But he's a good lawyer.
I appreciate you guys caring, but you have to understand that I don't.
Caring is lethal around here.
It's a disease.
You guys have it.
I don't.
So if you do care about me, don't infect me.
Now go win that pop-and-Iock-a-thon.
I'll see you Monday.
It's like watching a soul slip through our fingers.
But what more can we do?
Would you stop?
Tango.
I don't know how you did it, man, but you're looking at the firm's next partner.
If I wasn't actively repressing my bi-curiosity, I'd kiss you on your beautiful mouth.
Well, maybe you can return the favor one day.
Oh, maybe I can return it right now.
You probably know it was someone here at the firm who turned you in.
God, this is really hard.
Alan, it's okay.
You can tell me.
It was Thompson.
Thompson.
Yeah.
Thompson, that adopted three at-risk teens and donated his kidney to a temp.
All an act.
Yeah.
Why do you think he quit right after you left?
Well, his wife died.
Did she, Jeff?
Did she?
Anyway, congrats.
Hey, let's go do some shots with Phil, huh?
No, you go ahead.
I, uh I think I caught something at Greendale.
College chicks.
I get you.
Ha, ha, ha.
You're bad.
Come on, it hurts.
Come on, it hurts.
Come on, it hurts.
Ben, you need to switch up your moves.
Whoa, do my eyes deceive me?
Troy Barnes tagging in for the save.
Only two teams left.
The Poppy Lockstockings and the Heather Pop-and-Locklears.
Troy, what's wrong?
I don't know.
My heart's just not in it.
Maybe we should quit.
I mean, who even cares about this anyway?
Next up, looks like Jeffrey Winger.
Oh, Jeffrey, you're back.
Did you miss me?
Took you long enough.
Oh!
Now we got it.
- Hey, hey!
- Yes.
- Moves McGee.
- Whoo!
Did you punch Alan in his rotten face and storm out?
Hell, no.
That guy is useful to me.
Thanks to you, I've got leverage over a spineless jag that just made partner.
That is the place I want to work.
But I prefer to hang out with cool people.
People so cool, they care.
Aw.
And now, the puppet.
Jeffrey.
Ah, no parking on the dance floor, Winger.
Heh, heh, heh.
No, I'm serious.
You're disqualified.
The winners are Poppy Lockstockings.
No!
I've been popping and locking for five hours and you threw it all away.
The contest doesn't matter.
What's important is we have each other.
Then can I be in your study group?
Well, that wasn't the deal.
We lost, so That was dope what we did.
That was so good.
The puppet too.
The puppet was surprising.
I rolled my ankle during that, you know that?
You know what?
He's bringing us down.
Let's move him.
Can we move him?
Psst!
Troy, it's me.
Abed?
I made it through.
I'm a cartoon now.
That's impossible.
Nothing's impossible in here.
Animals talk, your heart is shaped like a heart and the smell of pie can make you float.
You have to believe, Troy.
Wait, you don't have to believe.
I didn't.
I didn't.
I may have done some damage there.
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Oh, what are you guys doing together, just the two of you?
We're gonna raise money to help with the oil spill.
Making this display to show how serious the problem is.
Oh, yeah.
Each drop represents Ooh.
Oh.
I'm so glad this overshadowed Haiti.
I didn't have ideas for that.
Yay to having fun in pairs.
What up, party people?
You got a Band-Aid on your arm.
Be careful shaving.
I wax, dummy.
This is from a blood test.
Oh, no.
I knew it.
Things were going too well for you.
Oh, no, no, just a physical.
Even a Ferrari needs a tune-up.
Are you guys moonshiners now?
No, just the two of them.
We're raising money for the oil spill.
Did you even know?
Uh, yeah, I have the AOL homepage bookmarked.
Did you even know about the ostrich that raised a tiger cub?
Troy, what's wrong?
I just saw a dead body.
Told you not to use the east stairwell.
My pastor said it's meth season.
You know I'm living with Pierce now, so this morning I went to do laundry in the garage and I found his mom, dead.
Oh.
Troy, that's terrible.
Well, she had been in bad shape for a while, so I guess she crawled out there to die like a cat.
I've never been close to a dead body.
Oh, pumpkin.
She was so cold and grey.
I saw her underwear.
Jeez, who died?
Pierce, we're so sorry to hear about your mom.
Why?
Losing a loved one is always difficult.
What?
My mom isn't dead.
But when Troy found her, he said Her heart, lungs, kidneys and brain have stopped working.
And another way of saying that would be?
She used up her organic body.
By dying in it.
Wrong.
She's alive.
Mom was a part of my Buddhist church.
She's a Level Five Laser Lotus, same as me.
When a Level Five's body stops functioning, it's vaporized in the Temple of Renewal and stored in an energon pod.
In a few years, when our technology advances, they'll extract her body vapors, re-condense it to a solid.
Before you know it, Mom will be back in the kitchen making Troy and me sandwiches.
Heh.
Pumpkin.
It's okay.
Oh, sweetie.
Did you guys hear about that turtle in China?
Two packs a day.
If you guys let me get to the can opener, I can feed you.
We have to do something about Pierce.
He thinks his mom isn't dead.
He's gone crazy.
"er"?
He won't even let us have a memorial service.
I was halfway done with the collage.
He hasn't cried yet.
I'm told that's not normal.
Who's normal, Abed?
Baptists are, but that's beside the point.
Everybody has some service for the departed.
Eskimos, witch doctors, Jewish people.
Cool, we made the list.
The point being, death needs to be coped with, not ignored.
Otherwise why did mankind concoct all these religions?
You wanna rephrase that?
Oh, I'm sorry, humankind.
You think you're real smart.
Guys, guys, guys.
Did we learn nothing from last Christmas?
I don't see much difference between Pierce's religion and anybody else's.
You're not listening, because his has lasers.
You guys make fun of me for not caring about religion.
But at least I'm dedicated enough to not caring to let you have your own beliefs.
Can't Pierce have his?
Can't you be cool like me?
Hello?
He ends so many of his speeches that way.
Morning, guys.
Morning, Pierce.
- How's Mom?
- Terrific.
Her body is being vaporized as we speak.
- What does that feel like?
- It's the greatest feeling ever.
Like the second when the fudge on your sundae is still hot, or when you're the first one to break in a new boob job.
You're free from the burden of your earthly body.
It is a burden.
Greetings, class.
I am Dr. Lan Duncan.
Now, I don't normally teach Anthropology, but apparently, Professor Bauer tried to strangle Mr. Winger and has been put on leave with pay.
So, what is anthropology?
Seriously, does anyone know?
You, in the boobs.
It's the study of humanity.
Wow.
Wow, I thought psychology was a racket.
Well, well.
I heard there was a drunk limey teaching this class.
I'm not drunk and I can prove it.
I blew beneath the limit this morning.
That's reassuring.
Also I would like everyone here to know that this man assaulted me last year.
And I have a restraining order, so I can have him expelled if he comes within Twenty-five feet.
Abed.
Abed: Yep.
Proceed, Dr. Teeth.
It is the single largest disaster in recorded history.
It is worse than 50 Exxon Valdez spills.
You don't have to yell at us.
Nobody is on the other side of this issue.
And the pelicans are covered in oil.
Everyone likes pelicans.
They bring babies.
That's storks.
Right.
Well, we still like them.
Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah, we do.
I'm gonna give you another 20.
Aw.
Thank you so much.
I'm here for my test results, if you haven't framed them yet.
Hey, gorgeous.
Jeff, you have something very infectious.
What?
Charm.
You got me, Jackie.
Seriously, everything looks great.
You're an incredible specimen.
Even your moles are shaped like little hearts.
Only thing I suggest, see a doctor.
And get a prescription for cholesterol medication.
What?
Why?
Your cholesterol's a little high.
No big deal.
Eat some egg whites.
But I don't understand.
Wait, did I accidentally tell you you have AIDS?
I've done that before.
I mean, it doesn't I treat my body like a temple.
I can't be the first person to tell you that the temple doesn't last forever.
I mean, it's made of hamburger.
This is a Temple of Doom.
And like the real Temple of Doom, it represents the inconvenient fact that all good things, be they people or movie franchises, eventually collapse into sagging, sloppy, rotten piles of hard-to-follow nonsense.
I need to be alone.
Uh, you can do that by leaving.
Okay.
Let's get going.
These Paps aren't gonna smear themselves.
There is no God!
Tell us how you really feel.
Am I right?
Did you get the results of your blood test?
I'm fine.
I figured.
Thank you for wising us up.
We were being judgmental about Pierce's religion.
But the fact is Jesus accepts The fact is everyone's dying.
And we all have these notions that we're the exception, but we're as wrong as we are dead.
That's nice.
How's it going with the side project that the two of you are doing?
It's great.
I made $236, plus Britta's makes Well, all totaled, we're close to 250, right, Britta?
Mm-hm.
Greendale cares about this issue.
Yeah, I don't think that's it.
What do you mean?
Come on, Annie.
Guys are giving you money because of the sexy schoolgirl routine.
I have a routine?
Yeah.
The one where you use posture as an excuse to stick out your chest and you laugh at guys' unfunny jokes, pretending not to know that they have a sock at home with your name on it.
That's me.
And if a guy wants to make a puppet of me, that's hardly your concern.
I may just be an outsider here because I was never called to participate, but it seems to me that Britta's upset because she's raising less money than you.
I'm raising less money because I'm not jump-starting date rapists.
Ooh-hoo.
Bitter much?
Say "bitter much" much?
Say "say 'bitter much' much" much?
It's not my fault.
I used to wear a back brace.
That's why.
What's with the lava lamp?
It's not a lava lamp.
It's my mom.
Oh, snap.
Wait, what?
The temple finished vaporizing her.
This is Mom's energon pod.
That's her vapor in those bubbles.
I'm sure that thing was free, right?
Energon doesn't grow on trees, Jeff.
It's harvested by super bees in Buddha's meteor crater.
Which is at the foot of Mount Sky Mall in The Sharper Image Valley?
Sorry, I overslept.
The sidewalk is more comfortable than it looks.
Drunk.
Shut up.
So where did we get to yesterday?
You are drunk and stupid.
Actually, Ben, I do have a wee bit of a headache, so if you could just Isn't that interesting?
I have a right to be here, sir.
You do, you do.
And I do hope you have very good hearing.
Bastard.
So where did we get to yesterday?
We were talking about humanity, which starts with birth and ends with death.
True, all life ends in death, which we as a species are cursed with knowing, resulting in something.
Again, this is really not my field.
Professor, what would you say might be the difference between a religion and a cult?
Why don't we open that to the floor since I don't know and the book for this class is expensive?
Well, I would say a cult might, for instance, sell you a tube of Jell-O and tell you your mother is in it.
Jeffrey.
Are we thinly veiling personal conflict and passing it off as a lesson?
Because if so, please continue.
Reformed Neo-Buddhism is not a cult.
It is a new way of looking at the world, emphasizing empowerment.
Like a video game?
Yes, Troy, very much like a video game.
You gain levels and at a certain point, you actually can eat a ghost.
What?
I wanna eat a ghost.
No, no, do not let him pollute your brain with this crap, Troy.
- It's okay to ask questions.
- I have a question.
Your mother went from solid to vapor.
Do people ever take liquid form, like creatures in The Abyss or Children's Tylenol?
It's a good question.
Actually, when Buddha returns, we all take liquid form and merge into a shimmering ocean of knowledge, which, according to scripture, tastes like Hawaiian Punch.
Hawaiian Punch.
If you're curious, come to my church's Open Hive tomorrow.
You know, wine, beer and free credit checks.
How much wine and beer per person?
Oh, come on.
We're having a con What?
Excuse me, is this Anesthesiology?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
Just go with this.
It's really sad.
I've seen it.
Anything helps.
Just anything you can give would be really I don't have Hey.
I, like, need you to save the pelicans.
They're all feathery and pelican-y.
I love them.
Thank you.
Wow, it really is easy to raise money when you sell out your gender.
It's even easier when you're not standing next to this: Hey, jerk.
You're stupid.
Give me money.
I know more than you.
I don't know anything.
I need boys.
Saving the planet makes my back hurt.
I obviously don't need guys for anything.
That's why I wear stripper boots and eat only celery and mustard for lunch.
Oh, I never stop smiling.
I never start.
My sweaters keep shrinking.
I get up an hour early to ever-so-slightly curl my hair.
Yeah, you're both so different.
Skinny bitches.
Hello, Billionaire Boys Club.
What happened in class today?
You pulled 40 minutes of anesthesiology out of your ass.
Yeah, I did.
But I meant your elderly friend.
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Do you know how many times I haven't eaten a doughnut?
I do not.
How I got teased in grade school for dabbing my pizza with napkins?
I've suffered.
I've denied myself.
Mm-hm.
Because the rules said, if I did that, I would live longer.
But then, halfway through the game, I get this little update.
That it doesn't matter what I do.
I could eat powdered bran every day while you suck down pudding and I still might die first.
It's unfair.
I want my doughnuts back.
Well, I think you're being a little childish and Hold on.
I need to use my force field to prevent Chang from getting food.
Now, where were we?
Look, the way I see it, while claiming to have no religion, you were actually devoutly worshipping yourself.
And now that your god has high cholesterol, you're trying to kick Pierce's in the balls.
You're right.
All I've been trying to do is crush Pierce's faith to feel better about dying.
And?
Now that I realize that that was my goal, I can really roll up my sleeves and get it done.
There it is.
Thank you.
Welcome.
No, that wasn't what I was Actually, I don't care.
Hey, girls, guess who found Buddha?
Hey.
Hey.
We're on our way to Pierce's Buddhist Open Hive.
First I'm taking these fellas for ice cream as an apology for questioning Pierce's faith.
Pierce says there's this 69th flavor I need to try.
I am excited.
Hey guys, my car's over there.
Cool.
Guess what.
I'm not actually taking them for ice cream.
I am taking them to the county morgue where I have confirmed that Pierce's mother's very un-vaporized corpse will be lying on a stainless-steel slab for all to see.
Surprise.
Welcome to reality.
Welcome to death.
Have fun.
Good luck.
Wow, you guys are real downers.
I can't believe I made out with both of you.
Ugh.
I'll check the basket.
Sorry, I almost arched my back a little.
I know you hate that.
I should count it, since I'm a calculating bitch.
No, I should, since I'm the one who's whoring out our gender.
Give that back.
I'm gonna count it!
Let go!
Give me that!
Ugh.
Oh!
Oh, yeah?
You think this is funny?
You think it's funny?
Get off of me.
Come here, you little brat.
I'm a brat?
What the?
I hate you!
Now, this is why I came to America.
Maybe we should listen to some music.
No problem.
I brought the jam book from the Pierce-mobile.
I could play some of the old stuff, but you guys would make fun of me.
Heh, heh, heh.
So I'll throw you a bone and put in some Loggins.
This ice cream place is far.
Trust me, it's worth it.
What's this?
This is Mom's handwriting.
Is that what you were doing in the garage, you silly goose?
She spent her last moments alive making a CD?
That is gangster.
Pierce, you've found the CD, which means I'm dead.
Vaporized.
I'm not vaporized.
I'm gone, Pierce.
Gone forever and that's how I like it.
Life is only worth a damn because it's short.
It's designed to be consumed, used, spent, lived, felt.
We're supposed to fill it with every mistake and miracle we can manage.
And then we're supposed to let go.
I can't force you to do that for yourself, Pierce.
But you can't force me to stay.
And if you unscrew the top of that stupid thing, you'll see it was made in China.
I love you, son.
Goodbye.
I'll play myself out.
Well, that proves one thing.
That woman was really losing her marbles toward the end.
You seriously still think she's in there?
Why wouldn't I?
No reason.
So where's this ice cream place?
Yeah.
Oh.
Um You know, I think I actually saw a better one back there.
The place I was gonna take you is kind of depressing.
Oh, can we get a little more sawdust on that storm gutter?
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry too.
I just got jealous of you.
No, but you totally called me on what I was doing and I only kissed Jeff to see if I could do it.
I wanna be cool and sexy like you.
I can't believe how gross I am.
I only slept with Jeff because I hate myself.
That's why I got after you for raising money.
I'm twice as gross.
No.
And you know the reason that we raised more money in five minutes of oil wrestling than in two days of fundraising?
Because men are even grosser?
And when we forget that, they win.
Aw.
Yeah, all right, all right, all right.
Yeah, do it.
Oh, so you got actual ice cream?
Yeah, with peanut butter and hot fudge.
What the hell, right?
Nobody lives forever.
No offence.
Think what you want, it's a free country.
I barely saw you this week, Abed.
What have you been up to?
Not much.
Hm.
What?
Whoa, busted, 25 feet.
Which puts you in violation of this restraining order I filed against you for abusing me with your restraining order.
Ah!
Mutually assured destruction.
Well played, Chang.
Thank you.
That That means a lot.
Do you mind getting a quick photo of me with the oily co-eds?
Centre button.
You're the man.
Okay.
No problem.
What, what?
He's not a projection.
He's the British guy pretending to be Tom Berenger.
It was a mislead.
That's the whole point of Inception, subversion of reality.
He hasn't seen it yet.
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
City College has a space simulator.
We know, close the door.
As I was saying, on Monday, City College will be unveiling the City College Cosmic Pioneer, their very own orbital launch simulator.
Pretty soon, they will have an astronaut on their brochure, and we will still be bragging about our Foosball table.
What do you think happens to enrollment then?
I don't know about you gentlemen, but I love my campus.
I don't wanna watch it become a City College parking lot.
Well, what can we do?
We can launch our own space simulator.
Before they simulate their launch on Monday, we simulate a launch this weekend.
We make Greendale, not City College, the first community college to pretend to put a man in space.
Do we even have a simulator?
We can get one.
In 1980, the county museum had a state-of-the-art space mission simulator, sponsored by Kentucky Fried Chicken, called The Kentucky Fried Chicken Eleven Herbs and Space Experience.
- Gentlemen, Greendale's future.
- Oh.
Actually, that photo is from the past.
Here's one more current.
- It's seen better days.
- I admit, it could use a good wash.
And I've got just the crew to wash it.
Can we stop walking in slo-mo now?
Twenty more yards.
You guys are walking in slo-mo?
You guys are an hour late.
Abed kept making us redo our walk.
I think you know the reason this group has been chosen for this job.
To atone for the obscene entry you submitted in the Greendale school flag contest.
That's right, I know that this isn't a symbol for the crossroads of ideas, I now know it's a butt.
Yeah, keep snickering.
Pack yourselves with peanuts and really be satisfied, but guess what.
This won.
This is now our school flag forever.
Proud of yourselves?
How do you know it was our design?
We submitted it anonymously.
Whoops.
One of you actually came forward.
What?
Now, somewhere beneath this dirt is Greendale's newest pride.
And my hope is that while you scrub it, you will find the school pride in your hearts.
After we clean it, can we go inside?
No.
That is a job for some upstanding students who are training right now in the Simulator Simulator.
Great job on this.
Hard to believe I'm not really not really in space.
I expect this craft to be squeaky clean in time for the pretend launch in front of the press at 3:00.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to make this into a butt flag.
I remember this thing from high school.
During field trips, we used to sneak inside and get to praying.
Oh, that's nice.
We should take a coffee break.
Let's all get coffee.
Where are Troy and Abed?
They made their way into that thing after the dean left.
What?
Oh.
It's more beautiful than I imagined.
You've never been in it?
My dad never let me.
He had a grudge against restaurants, they almost wiped out his falafel stand.
I memorized every detail of this old girl on the Internet.
Guys, we can't be in here.
Then get out.
Wow, pretty well-preserved for something that survived the '80s.
And a local transient who liked to collect doll heads.
Ah.
The '80s.
Our teen years, right, everybody?
I feel like I'm underdressed for this.
I'm gonna get something from the dorm.
Guys, seriously, I have to ask that we all step out of here.
You gonna tattle on us like you did with the flag?
I didn't tattle, but you shouldn't have made it.
If you love Greendale so much, why don't you marry it?
Sorry, sorry, I'm a little claustrophobic, that's all.
It's no big deal as long as I'm standing near a door.
In closed situations I get a little nuts and I don't know what's gonna Hey, hey, hey.
No.
Hello?
Greetings.
I am Systematic Android Network Diode Energy Rocket System, but you may call me Sanders.
Sanders, Sanders, this is Pierce Hawthorne.
Can I get this door open?
Look for the handle.
There's got to be a handle.
It was the '80s.
Everybody who made this was on cocaine.
We can't be in here.
Just as Kentucky Fried Chicken's secret process seals in the flavor, I'm sealing the cabin's air so you don't explode on your journey.
What?
What does that mean?
Please find a seat, strap yourself in and wait for Mission Control.
Okay, we gotta find a handle on this door.
Guys, can we take a mental step backwards and realize we are simply in a Winnebago and we'll be fine?
Oh, my God.
Please find a seat.
Strap yourself in and wait for Mission Control.
I'm not strapping into a coffin.
We gotta get out of here.
I hope you've found a seat.
I want you to be safe.
Did you just threaten me?
Pierce, you're talking to an Atari cartridge.
Sit down.
Ah!
Oh, we're moving.
This is part of the simulation, right?
I don't think this is a simulation.
I think we're being towed.
Come on.
Hello?
You guys, forget it.
Whoever's towing us can't hear us.
You know, this is classic Greendale.
That place deserves an anus flag.
- Can anyone get a phone signal?
- No.
Mine's working, but it's that black guy with the wrong number.
Pierce, I keep telling you that that is an iPod, and you are listening to Wesley Snipes' audio book.
He sure hates the government.
This is a long shot, but maybe if I do this, it will solve everything.
Damn it.
This is all my fault.
Very much so.
Hey, when you go fishing, sometimes you catch a boot.
Where are you?
Where?
Hello?
Where are you hoodlums?
Bring my spaceship back.
Uh We are Forty light years outside of the Buttermilk Nebula, although it is possible Yeah, it's a sticker.
Hey, Terrible Dean.
This thing is being towed with us in it.
Oh.
Oh, okay, wait.
So handicap spots count on Saturdays?
Assuming we don't wind up in a compactor, when we get back, I am going to step on you.
As much as I might enjoy that, if you don't get back in time for the launch, City College wins, and Greendale becomes just another school on my resume that no one can call because it doesn't exist.
Now tell me where you are.
In a moving canister with no phone and no GPS because the only window is sealed shut.
Hell Hello?
Jeffrey?
Damn it.
It isn't sealed shut.
Hmm?
Window isn't sealed, it slides open when you complete the simulation.
Well, can you talk them through it?
Hey, Abed.
If they can open that window, they can tell us where they are, and we can find them.
I was supposed to be on that thing.
I know how she works.
Hey, that's why they need you to bring her home.
I'll get us some coffee.
Psycho.
- Troy.
- Abed?
You can get that window open by doing the simulation.
Look at the panel, tell me your recipe.
Original.
- How many pieces?
- Six.
- Flavor?
- Tasty.
We need to get up to delicious.
That makes sense.
Excellent work, captain.
Now keep your herbs and spices balanced while the crew helps you with teamwork.
Guys, we can get the window open if you man your terminals and we complete the simulation.
Yeah, I got a better idea.
Gooby dooby, gooby dooby.
We're all gonna die, we're all gonna die.
My readings indicate the need for cooperation.
I hate to pull rank on you, but I need you to man your station, Jeff.
I hate to pull reality on you, but you got your rank, captain, by sitting in the chair with the largest knobs.
My readings indicate Pierce.
- What?
- Pierce.
My readings indicate you're going to die alone.
Why is he saying that?
Why is he saying that to me?
He's getting worse.
Almost there.
Stop talking, old man.
You can't make me stop, Pierce, because Troy is giving me life force.
I knew it.
I knew it.
Hey, hey.
Come on, Troy.
Abed.
Hold on, Troy.
Kentucky One?
Do you read me?
Kentucky One?
Kentucky One, do you read me?
Kentucky One, copy.
Kentucky, come in, Kentucky.
I've worked out a way to reroute the power from the battery.
Reroute to what?
Everybody.
Here is the situation.
This is Greendale.
This is the maximum distance from Greendale we can drive to haul them back up here in time for the simulated launch.
And these are city impound lots, any of which might be their destination.
What are these other circles?
What circles?
Looks like you've circled restrooms and truck stops, there's another one.
Okay, that is a different side of the map and that is for a different project.
Why do they have star ratings?
Let's get to work, people.
Got it, talk to me, buddy, come on.
Well, we stopped moving.
Pierce has got space madness, so he's old, they're locking him up in the back.
You can't do this to me.
We just did.
Guys, please.
You're becoming animals.
Oh, shut up, we wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you.
That's not true, we weren't supposed to be in here when it happened.
When what happened?
When we got towed?
How did you know we were gonna get towed?
I set it up.
I called City College about transferring and the dean told me that he would get me in if I helped sabotage Greendale's launch.
I was to make sure nobody was around so they could steal it.
And then you guys were late, and then Wait, wait, you're transferring?
Why?
You guys thought that butt hole flag was so funny.
I respect you all to let you hate yourselves, but I respect myself too much to let you hate my school.
Yeah, I'm not buying it.
Yeah, let's kill her.
Wait, City College was behind this?
We gotta get back in time for launch.
Why?
We earned the right to pick on Greendale every day by going there.
Our school may be a toilet, but it's our toilet.
Nobody craps in it but us.
- Yeah.
- Now, that was inspiring.
Seriously?
Captain.
Get to your stations.
Thrusters.
Full.
Thermal shield.
On.
Navigation.
Three.
Chicken.
Yeah.
- Ready?
- Ready.
Suppertime.
Hold it.
- Congratulations, crew.
- You've worked together.
Now feast your eyes on the wonders of the cosmos.
Greendale?
Greendale?
Everybody, be quiet.
Everybody, quiet down, quiet down.
- Say again?
- Standby for location.
What do you see, gang?
We are in Coldwater.
Here, they're next to the truck stop with three thumbs.
Those aren't thumbs.
Greendale, do you copy?
Greendale?
I'm sorry, Jeff.
I'm afraid you're out of town.
I guess somebody will come get us eventually.
I really miss Greendale.
How many schools would let you make a butt flag, then actually fly it?
How many schools would let you get a degree in Theoretical Phys-Ed?
Annie.
We owe you an apology.
Nobody should have to choose between their friends and their school.
Thanks.
You shouldn't have tattled about the flag.
I tattled.
I told the dean it was our design.
And I told him it was a butt too.
What?
Why, Jeffrey?
He kept not seeing it.
I mean, it was driving me crazy.
It says, "E Pluribus Anus".
We should've put cheeks on it.
There is a time and a place for subtlety and that time was before Scary Movie.
Hey, guys.
I'm feeling a lot better now.
You sound good.
In a weird way, being in a smaller place like this, I was able to work through some things.
I think I'm ready to come out.
I'll kill you.
I will kill you, Sanders.
Come on, man, come on.
Get off my mommy.
I'm her man.
- Pierce.
- Stop it.
No, calm down, Pierce, calm down.
Hey, who's feeling skinny?
Dean, the press is here.
I tried to buy us some time with these sandwiches, but they thought I was doing product integration for KFC.
This Hawaiian bread, so good, though.
Time to face the music.
Craig.
Stephen, surprised to see you here.
You don't think I'd miss your moment of triumph, do you?
Greendale beating City College into simulated space.
Unless you're having trouble locating your ship.
You.
You were behind this?
The next time you provoke City College, you will lose more than a Winnebago.
Greendale, come in, Greendale.
Go ahead, Kentucky.
You can call off the rescue.
We're coming to save you.
Come on, you family-sized bucket of bolts.
Abed, construction on Spring Road.
I see it.
Left on Apple Valley.
Annie, left on Apple.
Hold tight.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi.
Get off of me.
They'll never make it back, Craig.
That thing might as well be on a simulation of the moon.
Oh, you know what?
Ah!
Yes.
Hey, wait up.
No.
Ladies and gentlemen, returning from their maiden simulation, the fabulous Greendale Green-stronauts.
Yes.
Yeah, that's good.
I picked the team.
I picked this team.
Well, Anne, I suppose you're not City College material after all.
Thank you.
Annie, that was great.
Good job.
Great job up there, captain.
Really?
Think I could be a real astronaut?
If NASA ever needs someone to keep an arrow inside a moving rectangle, I know who I'd recommend.
Abed, wanna take a seat in the captain's chair?
I think you've earned it.
No, thanks.
Can't imagine what could have been cooler than what I've done today.
Okay, that was cooler.
In the future Mission Control, headed for base.
Target acquired.
Two cardboard boxes I got a bogey on my six.
Yeah, I'm on your six.
Evasive maneuvers.
- Are about to become Still on your six.
I took evasive maneuvers, you can't be.
Then I'm on your 12.
That means I'm on your six.
Good.
- Space ships.
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
This is what happened.
We was camping.
We was eating.
And it was mountain lion jumped all the way down and eat my leg.
I think a mountain lion jumped down and eat someone's grammar.
Right?
The auto-tune remix is way better.
Go to related videos.
Uh-huh.
Good.
Professor?
Oh, Annie.
Don't start, we've been through this.
Anthropology is the study of humanity, nothing is off-topic.
No, it's just, I've seen this one.
Put in "Car Crash Camel Toe".
Oh, wait, wait, wait, "Ski Lift Ninja Crotch Rip".
Crotch Rip.
I'm a ski lift ninja.
Oh!
Look, Dolly Parton eating a hot dog.
Stop that.
Yeah.
I can do what I want.
What happens if you type in "God"?
Everyone hates you and asks you Do not boo her.
This subject's lack of definition cuts both ways.
If farts are fair game, so is God.
Top hit, "God of Farts".
Yeah.
- You asked for it.
- It balances out.
That's blasphemous.
Who wants to see that?
Seventeen million people.
Oh.
There were nine people at my church last night.
Auto-tune "God of Farts".
Yes.
Way ahead of you.
Abed?
Guess who's got two thumbs and has a career opportunity for you?
This guy.
I'm pointing my thumbs at God.
One thumb to say, "That's great".
I told my pastor about YouTube and how there's no light there.
Our church wants to sponsor the making of a video with a Christian message.
Ha.
What, "Rapping Jesus"?
Pierce, please step aside and make room for a new generation.
Abed, would you like to make a Christian YouTube?
You're Muslim As a Muslim, I'd be happy to.
As a filmmaker, no.
I'm a storyteller, not a preacher.
The Bible has been called the greatest story ever told.
Ben Lyons said the same thing about I Am Legend.
Oh, well, I'll have to rent that then.
Whoa.
What?
That's a lot of pasta for no veggies.
You're not in charge of what I eat.
True.
Britta.
And some damn broccoli, please.
Pierce has been acting out a lot lately, maybe you should talk to him.
How is that my job?
Aren't you, like, the dad?
Would the dad walk away from this conversation?
No?
Uh You're having cookies for lunch?
Yeah.
Hey, you didn't pay for those.
Call a cop.
Heads up, gay wads.
Oh, yummy.
They're better when they're free.
Fresh and stolen.
What are you looking at?
Your face.
That's what you're supposed to look at.
So?
So you gonna sit down or what?
Oh, no, I usually sit with the younger people.
Well, la di da di da.
No, no, we watch videos on YouTune, and you guys don't know what that is.
We don't care.
Pierce, looking for us?
We're sitting over there.
I can see.
Sheesh.
Did you take your pills?
Ooh.
Meet Mama's boy.
We're having a private conversation here.
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Hi, I'm Britta.
Pierce's Pbbt!
Very nice meeting you guys.
"Very nice meeting you guys".
She's a lesbian.
Come on.
Shirley, I read the New Testament.
The whole thing?
Being raised by TV and movies, I thought Jesus walked on water and told people not to have abortions, but it's cooler.
He was like E.T., Edward Scissorhands and Marty McFly combined.
I'd love to make a Jesus movie.
Abed, that's wonderful.
What do you think we should do?
Needs to be cool and addictive.
Like that video of the kitten falling asleep.
The story's been told to death, I wanna approach it in a new way.
We need a Jesus movie for the post post-modern world.
Like Jesus as a rapper?
No.
I wanna tell the story of Jesus from the perspective of a filmmaker exploring the life of Jesus.
That sounds very appealing to filmmakers.
In the film, Jesus is a filmmaker trying to find God with his camera.
The filmmaker realizes that he's Jesus and he's being filmed by God's camera.
It goes like that forever because the filmmakers are Jesus and the cameras are God.
And the movie is called, ABED.
All caps.
Filmmaking beyond film.
A meta film.
My masterpiece.
I don't like it.
It's okay.
You're reacting the way the world did to Jesus.
I'm reacting the way the world does to movies about making movies about making movies.
Come on, Charlie Kaufman, some of us have work in the morning.
You don't wanna work on the movie?
This means there is no movie.
This is the movie.
The game is Jacks and Deuces wild.
Except if the dean comes in and then it's Bingo.
Keep it, I got another one.
If you get caught with that, just say it's your 90th birthday.
Suddenly, it's adorable.
All right.
All right now.
What is this again?
B-19.
No, B-19 my butt, I told you guys, no poker.
All right, shut this down.
Shut your mouth down, fruit.
Oh, hey, unacceptable.
None of your business, and barely the truth.
All right, everyone, go home.
Excuse me, mister?
What, Pierce?
What year is it?
What?
Poker helps him remember.
Veronica.
Okay.
Okay.
You're okay, kid.
Shut up and deal, let's go.
Jesus, did you really die for our sins?
That's dopey.
Oh, uh Dope.
Oh, Freudian slip.
Perhaps due to my feeling dopey.
Do the line, atheist.
Jesus, did you really die for our sins?
That's dope.
If you think that's dope, check out these "beat-titudes".
# Blessed be the peacemaker's word To the meek # # The kingdom of Heaven Is open all week # # Jesus and me ## I have arrived.
I am watched as I am watching.
I am audience and creation.
The Earth shall know my power.
Abed, what are you doing?
Oh, great.
You blew the take.
No, no, keep rolling.
- This can all be part of it.
- Ahh There are no takes.
There is no viewer.
The film is the story, the story is us.
We are the film.
This is totally meta.
Let's get back to our non-meta production, shall we?
Come on.
No, I wanna watch this.
Troy, there's no time.
Then we quit.
Right, Britta?
I don't even believe in God, but I love me some Abed.
Yeah.
What are you?
But Oh, look at it.
"The story of the story is the story".
Sure, that'll play in Poughkeepsie.
I heard some theaters are gonna show it in reverse.
I heard it's the same movie backward and forward.
I heard the deleted scenes are the scenes and the scenes are the deleted scenes.
I heard Jesus died for our sins.
Wait, guys.
The director's answering questions in the cafeteria.
And it both is and isn't part of the movie.
Yes.
Get a table.
Abed, are we all in the movie right now?
We are all in a movie even when there are no cameras.
When will the movie be released?
When is life released?
Every minute is a world premiere.
My father has already bought the popcorn.
Excuse me, Abed?
But you aren't actually trying to say that you're Jesus, are you?
I am who you say I am.
Okay, yeah.
Whoo.
It's meta now.
Except here is a thing: I am a devout Christian, and you guys are feeding into this poor boy's delusions.
So cool.
She's an actual, real-life Pharisee.
Hey, bitch, why don't you go back to your temple?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Why don't you all stop confusing Jesus with an egotistical, filmmaking lunatic?
I forgive her.
So how's your film going, Abed?
Blasphemously.
It's not blasphemy to say that we are God, Shirley.
First Corinthians: He who unites himself with the Lord is one with him in spirit.
Did you just scripture me, Muslim?
Jesus was Jewish.
- Are you ever gonna let that go?
- Hey.
No religious talk.
Somebody's late.
What is that in your pocket?
Jeff, Britta, Pierce is smoking cigars.
What's it to you, butt breath?
Oh.
Look at your eyes.
Out all night with those hipsters?
Hipsters?
Pack of old people in the cafeteria.
"Hipsters" because they have hip replacements.
They do not.
Leonard will probably kick your ass.
Leonard?
You're hanging out with Leonard?
You know I hate him.
So?
Everybody hates him.
That's why he's cool.
You people don't get it.
I'm not sure that I want to get it.
Take a break from these new friends of yours.
They've got you riled up.
That's what Leonard said you'd say.
Well, Leonard is not a part of this study group.
So you apologize right now to What?
I'm not your father.
I never said you were.
Where are you going?
Out.
Uh When did Pierce become awesome?
I'm gonna shut you down, know that?
I do.
Oh, I'm supposed to shut you down.
I'm not gonna do it.
Don't.
I won't.
Good.
I am gonna shut you down.
Good.
You should have seen his face.
He was terrified.
You're his worst nightmare now.
You're old and you don't give a damn.
Boo-yah!
Ha-ha.
Don't make eye contact, we'll be fine.
Okay.
Silly old wuss.
- Hey - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
The dude is got a date.
Little lovely.
- Please give us a break, will you?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Don't wanna see you when I come back.
Go, run.
We've made them angry.
We've made them angry.
He left his keys.
Oh, who's up for a joy ride?
I don't know.
We could get into serious trouble.
Oh, come on.
If we get caught, we can just pretend we're disoriented, they can give us a ride home.
Where am I?
What year is it?
But we've all been drinking.
Oh, grow a schmekel.
Okay, everyone, this is the last scene.
I wanna thank you all for contributing to the greatest film ever made.
And on the seventh day, Shirley shut down production.
Abed, Shirley has informed me you are using school equipment on school property to make a religious film.
She has filed an official complaint, invoking the separation of church and state.
Pointed out the irony to her.
Don't give a crap.
Let's be ironic, shut it down.
Abed, are you making a religious film?
All movies are religious to me.
Nice.
But is it a movie about Jesus?
Is The Matrix?
Is RoboCop?
Is Superman Returns?
All stories are about death and resurrection.
I've got one, Wrath of Khan.
That's a good one.
Spock sacrifices himself for the crew and gets reborn.
How captivating was Ricardo Montalban in that?
I'm serious Except in Abed's film, the character's name isn't Spock.
That's true.
It's Abed.
Oh.
I'm getting creative goosebumps here.
I love Charlie Kaufman.
I need to run into editing, grab a chair and you can watch a take.
I would love that.
I've never watched a take before.
This is exciting.
Uh You Say what you will about Abed, but the man cannot be killed.
I mean, it's almost like he's Jesus.
I got it.
I don't think we should be driving, I mean, we're all, you know, old and groggy.
Ah.
Stop worrying.
Richard flew zeroes during the Big One.
What do you mean "flew zeroes"?
He's not Japanese.
What did you fly during the Big One, Rich?
Where am I?
Oh, come on, stop farting around.
Seriously, I don't know where I am.
What year is it?
How do I drive?
Hey, give me it.
Look out, look out.
Let's bail.
Wait a minute, what about Richard?
Screw Richard, it's every man for himself.
I'm getting out of here.
Richard, are you all right?
Well Am I Richard?
Yes.
Then I'm fine.
But who are those people that ran away?
Our friends?
That's a good question.
Oh.
What is?
- There are no takes.
- There is no viewer.
The film is the story, the story is us.
We are the film.
So, what do you think?
I need to take a walk.
Dear God.
My movie is the worst piece of crap I have ever seen in my entire life.
How could I have been so blind?
It's a self-indulgent, adolescent mess.
I can barely sit through it.
And now with all this hype, I've got a real Snakes on a Plane brewing.
Critics are gonna crucify me, my career will be over before it begins.
God, if you're out there, I know I don't deserve it, but I need your help.
Please take this project away from me.
Make it rain.
Send a meteor.
Anything.
Please?
Now?
Okay, I get it.
This is what I deserve.
I'll finish it up.
Hi.
I'm Pierce Hawthorne's emergency contact.
Here to pick him up?
No.
I'm here to be removed as his emergency contact.
- One second.
- Hey.
I've got a class.
Does anybody have?
Where is everybody?
Is anyone coming to get Leonard?
No, nobody comes for him anymore.
His kids asked us to stop calling them.
Why do you think he acts like that?
So we're in prison, right?
All right, bring him out.
Come here, Pierce.
Up, up.
Ahem.
Hey.
Go wait in the car.
It wasn't my fault.
Go wait in the car.
You want me to change that or not?
I guess not.
Could you do me a favor?
Could you add Britta Perry as a contact?
P-E-R-R-Y.
Give her a call a couple times a week?
She gets pretty worried about him.
And she works days, so make sure you call at night.
Everyone thinks what you did was destined to happen.
That it was proof God was making my movie.
A movie so good it could never exist.
They think I'm a genius, and they think you're a villain.
Hmm.
You heard me praying.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, this is gonna be good.
Abed sent me a new link and that man knows his video virality.
So you're just gonna drop all pretense of actually teaching us?
Yeah.
Here we go.
# Blessed be the peacemaker's word To the meek # # The kingdom of Heaven Is open all week # You finished my movie.
Don't know what you mean.
# Only from the saint there # # Lepers have feet there Dogs love cats there # # Cats love mice # You humble me.
You humble me too.
# And the tables are pies # # Ice cream is everywhere But never on your thighs # # Good news is It can be your hood # Okay, open your books because Abed has broken the Internet.
# As in word of God, yo ## Great.
So which one of us is gonna head home and Change.
Hilarious.
So you guys bought one of my outfits, and then staked out my apartment every day until I wore it?
That's not pathetic.
Okay.
Well, good job.
I guess I'm heading home to change now.
I hit traffic, did I miss it?
Darn it.
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
Halloween: A time of vampires, hobgoblins, Draculas, boogens and headless mice.
I'm George Takei.
You know what?
Let's just get to it.
How is it?
Pretty good taco meat.
I wonder how the dean scored this sweet spread.
Ah-ah-ah.
Chef Gaga never reveals her caterer.
And don't try reading my pa- pa- pa- poker face.
It's military rations from an Army surplus store.
I didn't read your poker face, you left the containers in the garbage.
Oh, well, um, you guys have fun.
I'm gonna go take out the garbage.
You may also want to adjust your iTunes setting.
When it's not playing an endless loop of ABBA's greatest hits, it's playing what may be your personal voice memos.
What?
Note to self: Get oil changed.
Check Netflix for that movie where Greg Kinnear plays a ghost.
No, an angel.
And something called Human Centi David Beckham.
Dragon turtle?
T. Rex.
Man, I wonder how much effort you put into being accidentally handsome for a costume every year.
Half the effort you'll be putting into eating and drinking.
Let me help you, dragon turtle.
Guys, Shirley's costume is once again unwittingly ambiguous.
I don't know what she's supposed to be, but she's not Miss Piggy.
I repeat, she is not Miss Piggy.
You're on your own.
Hello.
Guess who I am.
Umm.
Can't you just say?
No.
Pierce, are you okay?
Huh?
What?
Whoa.
Hey, if you get any more sweaty and puffy, your costume's gonna reach authenticity.
Oh, I don't understand.
Shut up.
He's acting like the impression of him we do.
"What"?
"Where am I"?
"Where's the black boy in the uniform"?
Leave me alone.
Get away from me!
Oh, man, just when you think it's funny.
- Pierce?
- You know something?
Okay, okay.
Okay.
Excuse me, I think my friend is really sick.
I'm not a doctor.
I'm a doctor.
Annie.
Rich, from pottery class.
Oh, hey.
Oh, hey.
Wow, this looks serious.
- Let's get him over here.
- Okay.
Boy, he is just not in very good shape, is he?
But you look fantastic.
Oh, thank you.
Look at you, with your hood.
Right, between Oh, my God.
What is it?
Get away from those hotties.
You're safe now.
If that thing comes back, I need one or both of your phone numbers.
Yeah, right.
I don't get it.
How do you do it?
Well, I'm wearing a $6000 suit, and you spent three days making cardboard robot armor.
Saying they feel sorry for you?
I'm saying I remind girls less of taking their little brothers to Comic-Con.
- Rich.
- More?
Put her with the others.
Hundred and two.
This may be food poisoning.
Rich, what did I tell you?
To rule out food poisoning.
Yes.
But also not to say the words out loud.
Who wants to walk my plank, huh?
Hey.
Okay, I'm ruling out food poisoning.
Guess who I am.
Michelle Kwan?
Wrong.
Kristi Yamaguchi?
Peggy Fleming.
Just been proven racist by the racist prover.
Hey, guess who I am.
Drink.
Have you noticed a weird vibe taking hold of this party?
It's like every fifth person is on something seriously hard-core.
Yeah, I wonder who's holding the key to your riddle.
Hey.
Hey.
Where's your costume?
I'm trying something new.
But our costumes go together.
I'm just a guy in a spandex suit and a helmet.
Well, I'm a sexy Dracula.
You mean vampire.
I don't need to know which Dracula I am to be a Dracula.
Nerd.
Your symptoms are progressing even faster than everyone else's.
How much of that taco meat did you eat?
I didn't eat any.
My name is Alex.
Must have transferred through Pierce's bite.
My God, I think you're right.
Annie, you make quite the little nurse.
Thank you, Rich.
You're quite a banana.
Jeez, why don't you guys just get a?
But the only people getting sick are the ones eating what I bought at your surplus store.
I never said the stuff was delicious, but you can't get sick, it's nonperishable.
What about the taco meat stuff?
The what?
The classic flavor?
Huh?
The one with the goofy label.
Here.
What goofy label?
What are you?
"Classified Phoenix.
If found, repeat key phrase, echo, tango, x-ray, nine, nine, seven".
Yeah, sounds delicious.
Anyway, it looks like taco meat and Hello?
Greendale Community College?
Speaking.
This is Special Operations Officer McHenry.
Hi.
I need you to listen to me very carefully.
Okay, one hint.
I'm a beloved character from our childhood.
I can't stop seeing it.
I know.
Leonard, behave.
I'm a Christian woman.
Leonard, you better back that pumpkin ass up or I will make a pie.
Hey, Jeff.
It's me, Rich, from pottery class.
Doc Potterywood, remember?
Rich, bigger fish.
There's an infection at the party making people act weird and bite each other.
We need to coordinate an evacuation without causing unnecessary panic.
Holy crap, Leonard's a zombie.
Zombie attack!
Never mind.
Oh, my God.
Um.
Um!
I'm sorry.
Open the door!
I've been told we need a little baby quarantine until the Army gets here.
The Army?
I know, right?
They said to wait for six hours.
Stay strong.
Guys, I hate to be the "we've got company" guy, but Hey, guess who I am.
Or don't.
Head to the back!
You punched a lady bee.
Let go of the door, you little bitch.
Welcome.
- Oh, thank God you're all right.
- Shirley, door.
Oh, he did it.
- Okay, did we lose anybody out there?
- No.
- Is anybody hurt?
- No.
Last question, and I know it's a long shot.
Did anybody shut off the dean's playlist?
Two percent milk, eggs, deodorant, Puppy Chow, black light, whole milk Okay.
Cotton swabs.
It's officially a waking nightmare.
Add Eat Pray Love soundtrack to workout mix.
When are the police coming?
- Help is on the way.
- Hello?
Help is on the way.
Help Hello?
Flavor Flav was right.
It's the end of days.
It can't be the end of days.
It's not 2012 yet.
It's not the end of days.
It's a rabies-related pathogen affecting the prefrontal cortex of the brain, causing hyperaggression.
It could take years to take over the world.
How many years?
One, one and a half.
End of days, end of days.
Good thinking, Jeff, vertical fold.
You making fun of me?
That jacket is worth more than the island you were grown on, Chiquita MD.
Chiquita MD, I like it.
This is a good time to let you know I hate you.
Shouldn't we be barricading the room?
I don't know.
These guys don't seem so I will help you.
Wait, before you barricade us in, I need to ask if anyone has been bitten.
You bit?
Huh?
You bit?
This pathogen is spread through bites.
If anyone has been bitten and you allow us to seal ourselves in here with you, you're putting us all in danger.
- All right, go ahead.
- Nice.
Okay, I got the middle.
Barricade.
Are we really just gonna sit here?
Army's gonna be here in six hours.
Why six hours?
- Are they hosting the Oscars?
- Damn.
And the winner for Best Adapted Oscar Burn: Jeff Winger for Oh, Snap: The Man Who Went There.
Those people don't have six hours.
Judging from the temperatures, in three hours, they're gonna suffer brain damage.
After that, they're gonna be dead.
What?
We have to do something for them.
Do something for the zombies?
If we lower the temperature of the building, would it break the fever and kill the virus?
It might.
I know where the thermostat is, out on the wall.
Troy, we have to rise to the occasion like Ripley and kick butt.
I'm not Ripley, Abed.
I'm a cool, sexy Dracula.
I make love to ladies and I survive.
I'm with Troy.
Guys, those are not zombies.
Those are our classmates and they're sick.
They can make us sick by biting us.
The banana said so.
It's true.
The incubation only takes minutes.
You get a stomachache, then your skin turns red.
Followed by cold sweats, muscle spasms, high fever.
Then the uncontrollable urge to bite uninfected flesh.
Oh, Jesus.
And I forgot one symptom.
Slurred speech.
You got bit!
I felt like maybe I was special.
Special?
You're not special.
I'm special.
I was bit 10 minutes ago and I'm f Oh, great.
Nobody's special!
Hey, Rich, just so you know, I hate you less now.
That's how much I hate your normal self.
You have to destroy the brain.
Hamster!
A hamster!
Way to go.
Run, run!
- Head for the stairs!
- Look out.
What about Annie?
- Don't look back.
- Why not?
Oh!
Shirley.
Don't look back.
We have to go help them.
You can't help them by getting bit.
It's occupied.
Occupied.
Oh, this is how I die, as Miss Piggy.
You're not Miss Piggy.
You're Glinda the Good Witch.
You knew?
Just so you know, I've always loved Peggy Fleming.
You're not a racist.
Mm-mm.
Mm?
Mm.
Get in.
Get in.
Oh, cool.
A dark basement.
I was just thinking we should be doing this in a dark basement.
Troy, why did you ditch your costume?
Why bring that up now, Abed?
We might die down here.
All the more reason to get this ironed out.
You called me a nerd.
What defines a nerd?
Committing to a costume with your best friend, is that what nerds do?
I don't know, because I'm not a nerd, so I'm not taking part in this conversation.
Shh!
Nerds!
Did you hear that?
Jeez!
It was just a cat.
Let's keep moving.
Holy crap.
What is up with that cat?
- Is someone throwing it?
- Let's keep moving.
Let's not keep moving, because there is an insane cat down here.
But what about the zombies?
Back burner, Troy.
This cat has to be dealt with.
- There it is, grab it!
- Get him.
Let's go through there.
Door should lead upstairs, the thermostat Enough with the thermostat, Abed.
This is not "pretend playtime, save the world" time.
It's quarter past "let's get the hell out of this building" time.
There.
There's a window.
If we climb that fence, we can hoist against the wall and then squeeze through it.
I vote we take the door.
He doesn't wanna dirty his suit.
For real?
Clothes make the man, Troy.
What the?
Hey!
That's my jacket.
My jacket, you're stretching it.
You're stretching it!
Go back, go back, go back.
Don't stop.
Keep going.
Move, move!
Now drop down, drop down.
To the gate, to the gate.
Go.
I'm not going without you.
Troy, make me proud.
Be the first black man to make it to the end.
Go, go, go.
Abed.
I love you.
I know.
No!
Ah!
Okay.
Troy, be honest.
Are you a zombie?
I will mace you.
Give me the keys.
People are gonna get brain damage if someone doesn't help.
Troy, there is something called chain of command, so unfortunately No.
Are you crazy?
How are you gonna survive those zombies?
I'm gonna be a nerd.
Better have a plan B. That's right.
Prepare to meet the power of imagination.
Okay, I don't know why I thought this would work.
Hey, get off me!
Get off.
You're so strong.
God, I hate this!
Get off.
Stop using your mouth.
Hello, zombie Annie.
What big fists you have, in your face.
Beam this up, Scotty.
In your face.
Zombie Shirley.
I don't know what you are, but in your face!
Abed, we're friends.
Abed, no!
Ah!
Britta.
Okay, okay.
I've been bit, y'all.
Damn.
Congrats.
You did what zombies do.
Jeff.
Still cool as a zombie.
Out of the way, out of the way, out of the way!
- Lock down perimeter!
- We got movement inside.
- You're Dean Pelton?
- Speaking.
Wow, six hours on the dot.
Yeah, well, practice makes perfect.
You the only witness?
I am.
All right.
Hey, we got uninfected in here.
How many are we talking?
Think it might be all of them.
All right, scenario B. Repeat, scenario B. Let's dose these suckers.
Dose what now?
Going in.
Go to scenario B. - I don't know.
I don't know.
- I don't remember anything.
- It's not bad, right?
- There you go.
You remember nothing past your decision to be Lady Gaga?
I can't believe that somebody would mass-roofie an entire party.
I can't believe it wasn't me.
I can't believe I believe you.
And I don't.
Wanna watch a movie?
Sure.
Aliens, cyborgs or zombies?
I don't know why, but I'm kind of over zombies.
Yeah, I don't feel like anything action-heavy.
How about something light?
You seen Marmaduke?
And so Troy and Abed went back to the dormitory for a viewing of Marmaduke.
I'm George Takei.
And if your name is Kevin, here's a little freebie for your cell phone.
Hi, Kevin can't come to the phone.
He's on a spaceship with me, George Takei.
Please leave a message.
You're welcome, Kevins.
Happy Halloween.
Voice mail.
October 31 st, 11:20 p.m. Troy, this is Chang.
There's not much time.
I don't think we're gonna make it.
Listen, if you survive, please spread this message for me: Shirley and I totally did it.
Chang, what are you doing?
Nothing.
Gotta go.
Why did he call me?
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Ready for the Bus Driver, Winger?
Know why they call me Bus Driver?
You've been traveling?
Because I'm taking your butt to school.
Nice.
Heh, heh.
Cool, I'm up.
No, game's to 15.
Since when?
Since you scored 11.
Sorry, Abed, I have to finish kicking Troy's butt.
All that angry talk about butts.
Kick your butt, stomp your butt, punch your butt.
Do they say "punch your butt"?
Point is, hatred of each other's butts.
Men play sports so they can seek out and destroy their own sensitivity.
Oh, I never thought about it that way.
Mm-hm.
Think we'll learn that in our women's studies class?
Hell, no.
We're gonna find our roots in that class and stop defining our gender by theirs.
It will be nice to get away from the boys and take a class with just us.
Amen.
Or a-women.
Heh, heh.
Am I right?
Bring it in for a boob bump, ladies.
- Uh - No?
We'll get there.
Hey, guys.
Remember those remote control cars and you thought you were real cool?
Well, it turns out you're not.
DraganFlyer, beyotch.
Yep, four propellers.
It's got a built-in spy cam.
Range, 100 yards, and it will strangle your stupid cars' little butts.
Pierce, we're in a game.
Yeah.
And we're really not into RC anymore.
What?
But that's a DraganFlyer.
Come on, Pierce.
- Pierce.
- I can't control it.
There's a little pilot in there.
Whoa!
Stop it.
Knuckle walkers.
Sorry, it was an accident.
So was the Y chromosome, but you don't see us throwing stuff at it.
Where are you guys going?
Away from your symbolically invasive balls to a women's studies class.
Which women's class?
Feminist Representations in Media.
I'm in.
Abed, we kind of thought this would be something just for the girls.
Sounds like it.
I'd love to learn more about you.
I'll change out of my sport clothes and meet you there.
Um You just lost You just lost a game You just lost You just lost a game With Troy Hey, sore loser.
Yeah, proud of it.
I want a rematch.
Hey, guys.
I raced here so I could save us four seats.
Thanks, Abed, but Annie can't see the board from this far back.
She lost her glasses.
I've never seen you wear glasses.
I wear contacts, but I couldn't find them without glasses, which I wear.
Cool, cool, cool.
Are we bad people?
No, I love Abed, but sometimes he can't take a hint.
We told him, this is a girl thing.
Ahem.
Excuse me, we were gonna sit there.
Oh, sorry, we didn't know, but now we're sitting here, so That's the problem.
You don't seriously expect us to get up and change seats for you.
Well, if you're further in back, less people will see your roots.
Um, excuse me?
Oh, the way you excuse your little mustache hairs?
You know what?
We're good people, so we will find seats elsewhere.
It's called the high road.
I hope it leads to a salon.
Oh!
You're back.
The leader's name is Meghan.
Why name your daughter Meghan?
Are you stocking up for a bitch shortage?
The one with the hole in her sweater's armpit?
Or whose sleeves are pushing her fat toward her elbows?
No, those are her cronies.
The one with crooked ears and no ankles?
Ha.
Damn.
Sorry, I overdescribed again?
No, no, Abed.
Describe those girls all you want.
In fact, what are you doing for lunch?
It's Wednesday.
Sometimes I eat in Jeff's car.
Don't tell him.
Troy, where are you?
You would go this far to avoid a rematch?
Jeff, what is this thing?
In my line of work?
A multimillion-dollar injury suit.
I thought schools got rid of these things.
I can't believe Greendale allows it.
Greendale doesn't.
That's why it's hidden.
Who else saw you come in?
If we say nobody, are you going to stab us with your bush scissors?
Of course not.
I'm Joshua.
And this is a place of peace and balance.
A place of nourishment.
A place free from darkness.
Because there's a trampoline?
There is something cool about being up here, Jeff.
I mean, at first, I was just jumping, but then But then you started bouncing.
Like a baby on the knee of a goddess.
Yes.
Yes.
Jeff, get on.
Oh, one at a time, please.
I must ask you to adhere to two simple principles.
First, for this place to survive it must stay secret.
Second, no double bouncies.
Feet, shoulder width apart.
Knees bent.
Just breathe.
At the apex of each bounce, there's a moment outside of time, outside of words, outside of everything.
A perfect moment.
A silent moment.
I call it the world's whisper.
Wow.
You're right.
And I don't mind admitting you're right.
Which is weird.
Thirty seconds on this thing and I already feel Jeff, you've been up there for an hour.
Yes.
Okay, Abed, girl in the pink.
Go.
Her forehead hangs over her head like a canopy.
Missed a belt loop.
Her stomach spills over her shorts.
Target destroyed.
It's called a muffin top, Abed.
Like a muffin.
Clever.
You guys said it's rude to focus on imperfections.
This is the stuff I filter, right?
Absolutely.
It's just kind of a guilty pleasure to hear it about certain girls.
Like Meghan and her friends, because they're bitches.
Oh, hoo-hoo.
That's nice.
Who needs a soda?
I'll get it.
I'm making you guys so happy, I wanna keep it going.
Aw.
Okay, I love Abed so much.
I know, it's like he's one of the girls.
Uh, guys?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, do you mind not looking at me?
Do you mind that your face makeup doesn't match your neck?
When I squint, you look like a circus clown.
Okay, I beg your pardon, geek?
I don't even know your peanut-headed ass.
We've never met.
Like your hair and dandruff shampoo.
Ha, ha, ha.
Filet of Meghan.
Service for one.
Okay, Abed, let's get back to the table.
Yeah, Abed, go with your skank.
Or keep going, up to you.
About what?
Her uneven bra padding?
You look like you're smuggling a lime and a coconut.
Go away, loser.
Tell that to the stitching in your ratty panties.
Or wear higher jeans on laundry day.
Damn.
That dis made me snarf, yo.
You know what, you're dead?
You're bow-legged.
See you.
Women of Greendale.
This cafeteria is hereby declared a Bitch-Free Zone.
Whoot, whoot, whoot!
I can't tell you how great I feel.
I wasn't sure that you would take to the trampoline's ways.
Some can't.
And some are just natural jumpers.
See you tomorrow, Joshua.
We better bounce.
Whoa.
That's Sharice.
I had sociology with her last year.
She told me I walk like a dude.
That's awful.
Abed, got anything?
I might have something to say about those jeans.
But you guys are sure it's not bad?
Isn't bad when doing it to bad girls.
You're really good at it.
You're like a machine.
Like RoboCop.
Exactly like Rowboat Cop.
Sharice is a bad rowboat.
Sink her.
Affirmative.
You look like a dude in those jeans.
They're bad.
Bad.
Hey, you dudes ready to shoot the rock after study group?
I'm gonna slit your butts' throats.
Nice catch, losers.
Go get it.
Sorry, Pierce.
We're not really into basketball anymore.
What?
What's up with you guys?
Why are you acting like that?
Like what?
Ah!
Gay boots.
Lady boots.
Heh, heh, heh.
He's a gay wad.
Those as comfortable as they look?
They're like wearing a pair of dreams.
I'm sure your shoes are fine, though.
You know what?
They are.
Something's up with you two.
I wanna know what it is.
Are you on weed?
Give me some, I'll smoke you two under the table.
Man, I feel so good.
It's like the campus is a gutter and we're spraying it clean.
I need you to come to the bank with me to have words with a certain something.
We'll take them down.
We'll take all these bitches down.
Ladies, are you okay?
Take it easy.
Um, did you just tell us what to do?
Here's the thing, it's a little rule.
Maybe you're not familiar with it.
Nobody tells me what to do, ever.
Whoa, cowboy.
I surrender.
You hear that?
Jeff's a bitch too?
Yes.
Take him down.
Cool.
Hey, Jeff, what's with the boots?
that even in 2008, those were tacky.
You go, girl.
Damn.
Why don't we just all take a deep breath and find some center?
Okay, that is it.
What are you hiding from me?
They're keeping relaxation secrets.
Tell me how to get laid back or I'll kill your families!
Okay, this place is lame.
Girls.
Abed.
Toodles.
I'm watching you two.
Twenty four, 2010.
These balls, on your butts.
Quick bounce before lunch?
Absolutely.
Let me just make sure that Pierce isn't hovering around.
Coast is clear.
What did you see, my pretty?
Wait.
Back, back.
Freeze it.
Can you blow that up a little?
Enhance.
Enhance.
Enhance.
Stop.
That's it.
Blow it up.
There it is.
Um, excuse me, girls, you're sitting in our seats.
I'm sorry, what did you say?
Oh, I didn't know you were deaf.
I suspected you were blind from the outfit.
Toodles.
See you.
Wait, why were you mean to them?
Did they insult you?
No, but that top insulted our retinas.
Go, girl.
Bad isn't that bad when you're doing it to bad girls.
Annie, when you laugh like that, you snort like a piglet.
Careful, Abed.
Be careful with your skin.
Your face is puffy, your eyes look like buttons.
Check that attitude at the door.
Check the door before you go through it, Shirley.
What?
What?
Abed, you cannot talk to us that way.
Someone has to.
You guys are being bitches.
We're not bitches.
We were just joking.
If that makes us bitches, we're all bitches.
Mm-hm.
Good point, Annie.
Mm-hm.
You told him.
Affirmative.
You're all bitches.
Nice shirt.
It would look better on a girl.
You're not fooling us with that Band-Aid, it's a zit.
You're all bitches.
Triple bitches.
Bitch, bitch, bitch.
Hey, bitch.
Bitch.
You're a bitch.
I'm a bitch.
You're a bitch.
Pierce.
Ha, ha.
How did you find us?
DraganFlyer, beyotch.
So this is the big secret, huh?
You two sneak out here and hang out on the big gay trampoline.
Lower your voice, Pierce.
This is our place of peace.
Yes, and now it's mine too.
Mine.
This is great.
I wanna go higher.
Please, you're doing it all wrong.
I wanna go higher.
Get up here and double bounce me.
That's not how we do things here.
Get up here and double bounce me or I'll tell everybody about this place.
Come on.
God as my witness, I will tweet it.
Unh!
Double bounce me!
Why are you doing this?
Double bounce me.
Do it!
Pierce, that's enough.
I hate you.
I hate you.
Double bounce me!
Father.
My legs.
Ow!
Oh, my legs!
Illegal trampoline!
They have an illegal trampoline back there!
Black jeans?
Nice try, Michael Penn.
Bangs aren't covering anything.
Pegged jeans.
Sweater balls.
Crow's feet.
Back hair into neck hair into regular hair?
- Look it up because you have it.
- You are just mean.
Nice.
Who taught you how to be a juice box?
Don't worry, I come in peace.
And whatever shampoo you're using seems to be doing the trick.
What do you want?
To restore the natural order.
What are these?
Destruct codes.
Get the blow torch over here.
Well, that seems a little excessive.
Joshua.
We've been looking for you all over.
Where are you going?
I got fired.
I'm leaving.
Joshua, we are so sorry.
Don't apologize.
It's my fault.
Guess that's what I get for trusting some black guy.
What?
I thought the only way to protect it was to let you use it.
Guess it goes to prove what I already knew: Non-whites ruin everything.
Oh, my God.
Joshua was racist?
That came out of nowhere.
Did it?
A place free from darkness.
And some are just natural jumpers.
It's going to be a maze.
Maybe I just didn't wanna believe it.
Maybe that's the lesson here.
Purity that demands exclusion isn't real purity.
- Maybe paradise is a lie.
- Not exactly.
Paradise exists.
Right here.
For once, he's actually right.
Let me buy you some ice cream.
My white guilt is doing somersaults.
Worth it.
Paradise.
Hey, horse-neck.
So, what's with the clothes?
I mean, you look like a toddler who got dressed in the dark.
- Ha, ha.
- Snap, here it comes, y'all.
Look at your face.
It's like your mom was a lizard who got raped by a Muppet.
That burn was brought to you by the letter S, as in snap.
What?
Too hurt to respond?
That's right.
You don't have feelings.
The rest of us feel ashamed of ourselves, so we act like bitches to make ourselves feel better.
But you did it to fit in.
And no matter how hard you try, you never will.
Snap, snap, snap!
Give it up!
Thank you.
Snap!
Snap!
Snap!
Abed, are you okay?
That was so cruel.
I deserved it.
I should have never been mean to anybody.
I tried to fit in, I took it too far.
We took it too far.
We became the kind of women that we hate, turned you into a monster.
Kind of monster that makes outlandish statements about weight.
Those kind of things hurt, even when they're not true.
And all because we were insecure.
Everyone is.
Even Tom Cruise knows he's short and nuts.
We're at the mercy of each other.
That's why there has to be forgiveness on both sides.
Oh, Abed.
Goodness.
What happened to Pierce?
Long story.
Men.
Yeah.
Pierce, will you knock it off?
I told you, I'm not controlling it, there's a little man inside.
- Hi.
- Pierce.
Listen, I wanted to let you know, Pierce, it's okay to exceed the recommended daily dosage.
And don't let anybody tell you different!
Who's going to be in charge of making sure he doesn't OD?
What?
When did we start doing that?
Three, two, one.
Troy and Abed in the Morning And we're back with Greendale's resident animal expert, Star-Burns.
My name is Alex.
Star-Burns joins us with his pet turtle, Shelly.
Now, I understand Shelly can eat over five mice a day.
That's impressive.
Turtles don't eat mice.
What do they eat?
I don't know.
Pellets?
I have no idea.
That's disappointing.
That's not good.
What is going on?
I was studying for my econ midterm.
You guys walk in, hand me this turtle and tell me to smile for the folks at home.
What folks at home?
These things give you salmonella, you know.
Let's go to Garrett with a check on the weather.
It's still sunny.
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
Anyone know how long it takes papier-mâché to dry?
Longer than it took Duncan to think up this assignment.
He's gonna appreciate the work we did expanding our evolutionary chart.
Oh, Britta, can you hold up the final stage of humanity?
I still think man is gonna evolve into woman.
Not a dragon monster with three legs.
Three legs?
Well, it's been real.
At least the paste smell has.
But I have a date to catch.
Or should I say a catch to date.
Oof.
I hope you just came up with that.
Look out, drive-by deaning.
I'm kidding.
Just a non-violent, verbal reminder.
The local shelter is having a Puppy Parade this afternoon.
- Aw.
- Oh, I wanna lick it.
I expect all of you to lend a paw.
Heh, heh.
Except you, Jeffrey.
I know you've got a catch to date.
Oh, like you're famous for your wit.
Puppy Parade?
I am in.
I wanna see if those wiener dogs are born that way, or if they start off normal and then get wiener.
Abed, did you pick up my pen?
It's purple with a gel grip.
Nope.
I'm strictly mechanical pencils.
More relatable?
It was just here.
You okay, Annie?
Chocolate?
Push you to the parade, Pierce?
No, thanks.
I don't want people to think of me as a handicap.
If anything, this chair makes me more than a human.
You move it by blowing into this tube.
It's the most expensive one.
I outbid three hospitals for this baby, and it was worth every penny.
Oh.
Oh.
Wait.
Please, just wait.
I'm sorry, but I need to know who took my pen.
Uh Sorry, I don't see it.
Yeah, sorry, Annie.
No.
Not "Sorry, Annie".
We passed "Sorry, Annie" eight pens ago.
I keep bringing pens and you guys keep taking them, and I'm afraid I'm putting my foot down.
Okay.
Now Annie has made it clear that this is an issue, so from now on, we need to be more respectful of her things, okay?
Okay.
Cool.
All right, it's not on the floor, so whoever accidentally took Not accidentally.
Accidents don't just happen over and over and over again, okay?
This isn't budget day-care.
Okay, whoever insidiously and with great malice aforethought abducted Annie's pen, confess, repent and relinquish so we can leave.
Maybe nobody took it.
Sometimes I think I lost something important, and it turns out, I already ate it.
I didn't eat my pen, Troy.
I know I brought it, and now it's gone.
Ah.
I took a photo.
Aha.
Zoom in.
See?
See?
I took this My pen was on the table.
No one has come in or out since.
One of you has my pen right now.
Annie, it's a pen.
It's not a pen.
It's a principle.
Not a good time to get gum.
Okay.
Are we going to the Puppy Parade?
Feels like a bottle episode.
Again with the TV crap.
Hey, meatball, did you take Annie's pen to make life more like Benny Hill or whatever you do?
Abed?
I wouldn't do that.
I hate bottle episodes.
They're emotional nuance.
I might as well sit with a bucket on my head.
I have a photography project to finish.
My grandmother's hands aren't gonna take close-ups of themselves.
Hasta la later.
Hmph.
Was that "hmph" directed at me?
If the "hmph" fits.
I don't have your pen.
I'm always lending you supplies.
You never come prepared.
If it's so important, have my pen.
That's my pen.
Whatever, people.
They're just things.
I don't suppose you'd mind letting us take a quick look-see in your bag?
I'd very much mind, Annie.
There's no such thing as a quick invasion of civil liberties.
Oh, man.
It starts with a quick look into someone's bag.
Then it's a brisk peek at our phone records.
And before you can say 1984, the Thought Police are forcy-worcing you to bend and spread.
Are the Thought Police gonna make love to us?
They find thoughts in our butts?
I should've read that book.
Stop using the Constitution as a baby blanket.
She invoked the Freedom of Information Act to request photocopies of my notes.
Heh, heh.
That's pretty good.
Well, excuse me for living free.
We all know the pen's in your bag.
Yeah, come on.
Yeah, come on, just drop it.
Happy?
Not if that's a used Q-tip.
Ew!
- Gross.
- Yes, gross.
Welcome to the gross business of martial law.
Welcome to what used to be individuality seized and disintegrated by cowardly groupthink.
Welcome, my friends, welcome to the machine.
It looks like you were wrong.
Britta does come prepared for one thing.
Or six.
Big weekend?
Can't complain.
Razzle pzazzle.
Attention, students.
The Puppy Parade is starting on the quad.
Better come quick.
Every moment, these puppies grow older and less deserving of our attention.
Whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?
Have you ever gone to a Puppy Parade halfway through, Britta?
Uh, heh.
It is pointless.
Then you clearly stole the pen.
The Patriot Act cuts both ways.
Actually, it's one-sided.
That's the point.
Here's my point.
Whoever the pen thief is just watched me get Guantanamoed.
I'd like to know who it is so I can let them know they have lost my trust.
It's a bottle episode.
We're sorry we looked at your prophylactic equipment.
Your lifestyle mistakes are none of our business.
Oh, thanks, Shirley.
Let's rustle through your tampons and wallet so we can apologize to you.
I'm sure everybody here knows I don't steal.
Have you checked?
If you took it by mistake, I forgive you.
If I took it, it's larceny.
If you find it under mother hen, it's a mistake.
Mother hen?
We're the same age.
Sure, unless time is linear.
I'll make your ass linear.
That doesn't make sense.
Your ass sense.
Don't get your panties puckered.
We're all really thinking if, and I mean if, the culprit is among us, statistically speaking, it's Troy.
Yes, we were all just thinking that in 1856.
Eighteen-fifty-six?
What if a ghost took the pen?
- Please forgive him.
- For what?
For stealing the pen, dummy.
Why would I take her pen?
I don't even like having my own.
It's probably under Pierce's cast.
He uses everything to itch his legs.
We're on our third DVD remote.
If I took the pen, I'd say so.
You probably forgot.
Been popping painkillers like Tic Tacs.
Oh, yeah, right.
"Side effects, verbal dysphasia and octopus loss".
I don't see anything on this squirrel about memory.
Now I wanna know who has it.
Nice try.
That doesn't take you off the list.
Jeff, you're in charge.
I demand you deal with this.
There's nothing to deal with.
I'll say.
Okay, all right, all right, everyone breathe.
You know what this is?
Yep.
Shut up.
This is a normal day with friends who are done studying and a pen that rolled away.
Rolled away?
Or fell down someone's shoe.
Let's check shoes.
Annie.
Fine, fine.
Someone in this room is hiding your pen.
Wanna know why?
They feel terrible.
They made a mistake.
They waited too long to come forward and now they feel bad.
They should.
Okay, okay.
So, pen thief, we understand what happened, and we forgive you.
- If you confess and apologize.
- But here's the trick.
Because this person now has no reason not to come forward, if by some chance, I get to the count of three and nobody comes forward, guess what.
We have to accept that no one has the pen, don't we?
Don't we?
Good.
So here we go.
One.
Two.
Pierce, you have something to tell us?
Yes.
Is it me, or has it become really obvious that Jeff took the pen?
- Yes.
- Definitely could be.
You wanna make a bet, you jerks?
Lockdown.
Abed, seal the doors.
Nobody leaves until this pen shows up.
I don't like this.
Yeah, tell it to the pen you might have.
Gwynnifer?
Hi.
Yeah, it's me.
I can't make it.
Well, tell your disappointment to suck it.
I'm doing a bottle episode.
Okay.
You just became my hero.
Thank you.
No pen.
I can see.
Why do you keep taking that tone?
Oh, I'll field that.
If nobody else has this pen, it means you realized you had it and were too embarrassed to say, and we kill you.
I'm not hiding my own pen, you paranoid weirdo.
Everybody stay within each other's eyelines.
Me next, right?
Hold on.
Can we please consider the threshold that we are crossing?
We don't trust Abed?
He shredded my backpack.
He freed my pet monkey.
Because we corrupted him.
He's our innocent.
He put gum in your hair.
Empty the bag, Abed.
Pierce, you don't have a bag?
Giraffe.
Uh, Jeff, you don't have a bag?
I'd never deprive the world of the part of my chest the strap would cover.
Makes sense.
What's left, hugging and crying, then we're done?
Wait, Abed, why is my name in here?
That's mine.
And Shirley's and Annie's?
- What is it?
- Charts, some kind of calendar?
That's my personal private business.
"Annie, 4 on, 28 off, next November 10th.
Britta, 5 on, 27 off" Oh, my God.
Are you charting our menstrual cycles?
What?
Gross.
Abed, this is so personal.
And so accurate.
Creepy.
I don't understand why you would do this.
I can explain.
I thought you'd keep yelling over me.
I can explain.
I have trouble reading people, say the wrong things.
I noticed it was happening more often with you three.
I noticed fluctuating patterns and started graphing them.
By the time I realized what I was measuring, it had started to yield positive results, so I kept doing it.
Were you ever gonna tell us about this?
I feel so violated.
Thanks.
More chocolate?
Aah!
Get away from me.
Abed just became my hero.
Can I have a little?
No!
Sheesh.
Guess it's true what they say about the sync-up.
If I could share a few words of sarcasm with whoever took this pen.
I wanna say thank you for doing this to me.
Thought I'd have to suffer through a Puppy Parade.
I prefer being entombed in a mausoleum of feelings I can neither understand nor reciprocate.
Whoever you are, can I get you anything?
Ice cream?
Best friend medal?
Anything?
Mm-mm?
Okay, sarcasm over.
You're last up, Shirley.
Dump your comedically huge bag and end this.
Uh No, thank you.
Well, well, well, Harvey Keitel.
Well, what do you know, Henry David Thoreau.
My, oh, my, Mike Tyson.
Empty the bag.
No, I don't have Annie's pen.
I'm a Christian woman that doesn't open her bag.
What did the Christian woman think would happen?
You'd find it on the Muslim.
Real nice.
Nicer than you, condom carrier.
Dump the bag or you're guilty.
No.
Aah!
Aah!
Oh, Lord, he's thrown a clot.
Pierce.
Call 911.
Pierce Aah!
No.
No.
- Pierce, you didn't need to do that.
- Yes, I did.
All you guys do is talk, leaving me to do the things you won't do.
People like you are the reason we took so long to get into Vietnam.
Is this what you were trying to hide, Shirley?
A pregnancy test?
And more importantly, are they seriously marketing them to black women?
Guys, this is a terribly childish way to handle this kind of situation.
Does this mean you have a new boyfriend?
Who, who, who?
Not that it's anyone's business.
I recently reconnected with my husband over Labor Day.
The Lord may have a plan that doesn't include that slut he ran away with.
You're not pregnant, Shirley.
Why does everybody think I'm old?
I'm around Jeff's age.
According to my charts, you couldn't Labor Day weekend.
You would have been ovulating on Halloween.
If you're gonna have a pregnant woman, I say go elevator labor or go home.
Halloween?
Well, that's that, then.
Yeah, what a relief.
Looks like someone narrowly avoided a mistake of their own.
Oh, or is it only bad if you sleep with unmarried men?
The Bible doesn't recognize divorce.
You marry a man, he's your man.
After he marries someone else, if you jump into the sack with him, you're an angel, so long as you don't use protection?
I'm so glad you're enjoying this.
And I hope whoever stole that pen enjoys it in hell.
Nice try, Stephen Fry.
Stephen Fry.
We all have an agreement.
Nobody leaves till we find it.
- Oh!
- Yeah, here we go.
We are gonna find this pen.
We are gonna find that pen.
Oh And if we can't find it, our children will find it.
Is it over here in these books, the pen?
This incredible, magical pen that nobody knows how it could disappear.
Oh, maybe it's right in here.
Guys, this is school property.
Can we just forget it?
It's a pen.
Oh.
It's a pen now?
Really?
It's not a principle anymore?
Now it's a pen?
Why the change of heart?
You're not seriously accusing me.
We searched my bag.
Which is exactly the last place you'd put it if you found it halfway through all this.
In fact, assuming that one of us does have the pen, who has the most incentive to make sure it never sees the light of day?
You wanna go there?
Yeah.
I'll go there, I was born there.
Okay.
Really?
There's a placard there commemorating me.
What's going on and how can I help?
Annie, relax.
No, you relax, Jeff.
Or are you scared if you do, my pen will fall out?
Oh, you precocious little bitch.
Okay, guys, guys, hey, guys, stop.
You're being completely illogical.
We divide by gender then search each other in our underwear.
What?
Now what?
Everybody shake.
Enough to dislodge.
Okay, anything hit the floor?
No.
What are those underwear made out of?
Oh, they're an organic soy-cotton blend.
This Gwynnifer must be real special.
Don't you usually wear the stripey Beetlejuice numbers?
What does she mean usually?
All right, end of the road.
We've torn apart the room, we've stripped.
There is absolutely no place left No.
No.
No.
No!
No.
Damn it.
Broke my scissors.
Here.
Be careful.
That's the last pair we have.
Also, don't cut his legs.
I'm worried we've gone too far.
This is how super villains are created.
Can't you just make a speech about trust throw in a few digs at a celebrity and put a ribbon on this thing?
Abed, think about this for one second.
If a single one of us leaves this room before we find that pen, how can any of us trust anyone in this group ever again?
What's your hurry?
I'm clothing myself.
I'm not comfortable in my all-together like you two anorexic jezeb Oh, I'm so sorry, that was really mean.
I don't know where that came from.
We've all been through a lot today.
And I'm sure this pregnancy scare's been weighing on you all week, right?
Mm-hm.
And maybe that's why you took my pen?
What?
Where are you hiding it?
Oh, my goodne All right, here we go.
It smells like a Waffle House sink.
Pierce, are you using Slim Jims to scratch your legs?
Have we not gotten to a place free of judgment yet?
This isn't it, this isn't it, where is it?
Where's the pen, where's the pen?
Where's the pen?
It's getting a little chilly outside, so the animal wranglers asked every student pick up a puppy and hold it so they stay warm while the volunteers hand out puppy-sized hats.
Honestly, I don't know why I'm even making these announcements.
There can't be anyone who isn't already on the quad.
Annie, I'd just like to say, on behalf of whoever actually stole this pen, I really am sorry about all this.
I knew it was you.
I knew it was you.
All I know is it could be any of you.
And for all we know, it's you.
I wish it were.
I really do.
I wish I could just find it behind my ear.
I'd rather be that stupid than have to think any of us might be inconsiderate.
After all we've been through, it almost seems impossible.
It seems less than impossible.
Something impossible actually seems more likely.
A Winger speech to take us home.
What if a ghost took the pen?
Let him finish.
I am finished.
For real, honestly, seriously, why not?
Why not just a ghost took the pen?
Okay, I've been saying that for hours.
And we should've listened to Troy from the beginning.
Guys, look in your hearts and answer this question honestly.
What's more likely?
That someone in this group doesn't belong in this group or ghosts?
If we have to choose between turning on each other or pinning it on some specter with unfinished pen-related business, I'm sorry, but my money's on ghost.
Well, I'm not a religious person, but I've seen specials on the paranormal.
- Anything's possible.
- Relative to the alternative?
It actually seems more logical to me.
Why would a ghost want a pen?
Troy?
Okay, so I see it as a lot like the movie Paranormal Activity, except for more boring and fancy.
And I think in 1856, it is possible that a man was beheaded while he was writing in his diary to his long-Iost love.
And now he roams the halls of Greendale screaming for his pen so he can write her a love letter.
"I need her, I need her," he screams as he looks for a pen.
What the hell did you people do in there?
Something you could only dream of, you non-miraculous son of a bitch.
Non-miraculous?
Wait.
Abed.
Now, who could resist falling in love with our next float?
This Autumn Colors puppy reminds us that while the leaves might be changing, responsible pet ownership is always in season.
Oh, here's a crowd favorite, the Top and Tails float.
A champagne bath and a red sports car?
Let's hope he's single.
Okay Oh, okay.
Well, this one feels a little preachy.
Oh.
Boo!
Boo!
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Agnes, cancel my appointments.
What appointments?
Wishful thinking.
It's called, "Alternative Energy: The Key to a Brighter Tomorrow".
Notice all the animals wearing sunglasses?
Because it's a brighter tomorrow?
Yeah.
My boys are in elementary and don't make as many dioramas as we do.
The Environmental Club is making them for Green Week.
This afternoon, in the cafeteria, we're having a Bio-Diorama-Rama.
I heard one kid made a diorama about a world without dioramas.
I sleep over at your place tonight?
Totally.
We're both done with classes, we can start the sleepover now.
Let's get in our pajamas and build a blanket fort.
A blanket fort.
Wow.
You can come hang out with us.
Uh, thanks, but I think I'll find something more grown-up to do.
Hmph.
Okay, enjoy eating fiber and watching The Mentalist.
- Britta, that wasn't nice.
- I'm sorry, Shirley.
But who wants to hang out in a blanket fort with grown men in tiny Underoos?
Hello.
So, Jeffrey, I was just looking over your class schedule.
Why?
Uh, maybe it was a random spot check.
Maybe it was a specific spot check.
Maybe I'm making a scrapbook.
The point is, you will not be receiving credit for your independent study: "Conspiracy Theories in U.S. History".
What?
Why not?
Because the class doesn't exist and neither does the teacher, Professor Professorson?
What?
That's his name, it's Dutch.
Oh.
I think it means professor.
I think it means poppycock.
The ultimate Jeff Winger blow-off class.
The one that doesn't exist.
Now I have to audit an entire system for shenanigans, which means, bye-bye, weekends.
Bye-bye, writing at Starbucks till a certain Persian barista asks me about my novel.
God, Jeff, it's one thing to blow off regular classes, but this devalues all the credits I work very hard for.
Can I defend myself and say this is nuts?
I've been meeting with this professor, in his office, every Wednesday, all semester.
Professor Professorson?
Yes.
Really?
You're gonna commit to this?
Commit to what?
Reality?
Okay, then, please, lead me to Professor Professorson.
Gladly.
This I got to see.
I've dreamt of playing charades with you, just not like this, and not on dry land.
Oh, man.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You thinking what I'm thinking?
We're too big for this, aren't we?
Yeah.
If we went two pillows higher in the corner we could vault the ceiling.
Bump up the square footage.
Make this a blanket fort for men.
Well, here we are, Professor Professorson's office.
Oh.
Oh.
I don't know what's going on.
Believe me.
I've spent a whole year studying conspiracy theories with Professor Professorson right here.
Wait.
Of course.
Conspiracy theories.
This is a test.
He's teaching me about real conspiracies by erasing his existence.
My God, do you know what this means?
That's how stupid Jeff thinks other people are.
I knew you were lazy, but I didn't realize you'd stoop to such pathetic lies.
One man's lies are another man's truth, wouldn't you say, Jeff?
I'm sorry, and who are you?
I'm Professor Professorson.
Wow.
You really had me going there for a second.
I thought I was going insane.
Precisely.
An actual conspiracy to round out your education in conspiracies and theories thereof.
Your real name is Professor Professorson?
My family name is Professorberg, but we changed it when we were fleeing from the Nazis.
I'm so sorry.
You've never heard of me, I primarily teach night school.
My faculty ID.
Huh.
Well, I guess I've never stuck around late enough to meet you night school professors.
TV's gotten crazy good, you know.
Well, I have to take this.
Thank you for indulging me, dean.
Jeff, read chapters 10 through 12 of Douglas and see you next week.
That is, if I still exist.
See you, professor.
Sorry to doubt you, Jeffrey.
More importantly, out with this audit, back to chapter one of: Time Desk: The Chronicles of Dean Dangerous.
That is gonna be the worst book I'll ever read cover to cover.
I'm a terrible friend.
I accused you of being a lying cheat.
Can you ever forgive me?
Sure.
Here's the thing, though: I've never seen that guy in my life.
What?
That wasn't Professor Professorson?
There is no Professor Professorson.
I made him up.
I forged a form with a phony teacher and class for a free credit.
I knew it.
Oh.
You lying cheat.
Wait, then, Who was that?
I don't know.
Wait, what?
I don't know.
What should we do?
We should grab some lunch.
I'm serious.
So am I. I saw Fat Neil headed to the cafeteria.
We got 10 minutes to grab the last lima bean.
You made up a professor and he appeared out of thin air.
You're not curious how that happened?
My latest theory?
I'm a god.
I've denied the signs.
So typical, you're gonna blow off what happened?
Yes, especially when not blowing it off might cost me my free credit.
Now, do me a favor, be very un-Annie and blow it off too.
Oh, sure.
Oh, I'll just blow it off.
I'll just blow everything off.
Heck, I guess I'll blow off walking.
Okay.
And now I'll just blow off standing.
I'm just blowing everything off.
- Excuse me.
- I'll blow off talking language.
Okay.
Hey, bros, what's the haps?
Whoa.
Sweet fort.
Can I come inside?
Can you give us a second?
Corn you gorben Bluh You could, Pavel.
Or maybe the inside could come to you.
How would you characterize the amount of blankets and pillows you have?
A buttload.
I get wicked cold, bros.
Mad sleepy.
If you're here to help me take my diorama to the Bio-Diorama-Rama, I can do it myself.
Yes, you made that clear in your You even work too hard at passive aggression, you know that?
Hey, so do you know anything about Greendale's night school?
Yeah, I'm assuming it's the worst thing you could ever hope to be in, only at night.
Damn it.
You've been playing detective?
You'll Nancy Screw me out of my credit.
Relax.
I only asked the administration desk if I could borrow a faculty directory.
And take a look at this.
Is that Professorson?
His real name is Professor Woolley.
And he actually does teach night school here.
Why would someone you've never met pretend to be your professor?
He was carrying falsified faculty credentials.
You know what this means?
Yes, you are making me do work for my fake conspiracy class.
Exactly, there's a conspiracy here.
A dark, vast conspiracy that may just go all the way to the top.
This is Greendale, Annie.
If there's a conspiracy, it goes all the way to slightly below the middle.
Wait a minute.
Something's wrong.
My car won't start.
Hold on one second.
Hello.
Tell your little friend to stop snooping around night school.
Otherwise, things might get explosive.
Annie!
You okay?
Yeah.
I probably didn't need to tackle you.
Probably not.
Looks like someone sent us a message.
A tiny, thoroughly underwhelming message.
I hope you've already laid out your outfit for tomorrow morning.
Because we're going to night school.
I stole these from my son's house.
When does a fort stop being a fort?
Hey, as long as it's still made out of blankets, right?
These will be perfect for the Pierce's Mom Memorial Tunnel.
So this is night school, but where's Professor Woolley's class?
How about this one?
No, that's Professor Huyck's class: "History of Something".
You can't pronounce it?
It literally says "History of Something".
Let me see that.
"Principles of Intermediate"?
"Studyology"?
"Class 101"?
Look, this one just says "Learning"!
With an exclamation point.
Hello, Professor Professorson.
Or should I say Woolley?
What class are you teaching tonight?
Math.
Math?
Uh-huh.
Do you mind if we sit in?
Not at all.
Right this way.
So, what kind of math do you teach, professor?
Oh, you know, math.
Uh Numbers.
Pi.
New math.
Um Get him.
He went into that blanket fort.
I think he went this way.
You see him?
No.
Come on.
- Troy, Abed.
- Hey, Annie.
Welcome to Fluffy Town.
No smoking, no farting.
We're in a chase.
That's allowed.
There he is.
Follow us.
But afterwards you should really check out our civil rights museum.
- Leonard, back up.
- You shouldn't even be in here.
You have three farting strikes.
He's getting away.
I know a shortcut through the Turkish district.
Hey, man.
Britta?
Hey.
Go.
There he is.
- What the hell is this?
- Latvian Independence Parade.
Don't look at me, they had the proper permits.
Dang it.
We lost him.
I sent the diorama car to the chem lab to have the explosive analyzed.
We could Isn't that him playing the trejdeksnis?
Nice try, Woolley.
Now tell us everything.
Tell you?
I'll show you.
What is this place?
This, Annie, is night school.
Every student, every teacher, every class.
Figments.
Puffs of hot air from the lips of a ghost in the shadow of a unicorn's dream.
I made it up.
Night school doesn't exist.
I used to be a student here at Greendale like you.
Then one day, I invented a fake course to get a free credit.
I had to create a fake teacher, who needed other fake classes that needed to be filled with fake students and so on, and so on, and so on, exchetera.
Did you just mispronounce "et cetera"?
My Latin class was fake, Jeff.
Like all my classes, like my life.
Aren't you listening?
Yeah, I am.
And a very familiar feeling is starting to come over me.
Someone is trying to teach me something.
Jeff, the only thing that's ever been learned in this room is regret.
Would that this desk were a time desk so that I could correct my past mistakes, ride dinosaurs.
Fight with Jack the Ripper.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Unicorns?
Ghost lips?
Time desks?
Doesn't any of this overly stylised garbage remind you of anyone?
Everything this guy says is ripped from the sure-to-be-unpublished pages of Dean Dangerous.
I don't know what you mean.
Oh, I think you do.
By the way, next time you walk someone to your fake lair, don't pass the Theater Department.
Drama Professor Sean Garrity.
Whoa.
Thank God.
That character was killing me.
Word of advice, if you ever scrape the dean's car, don't tell him you're gonna pay him back in acting.
On Thanksgiving, I'm supposed to crash his family dinner and accuse him of stealing my girlfriend.
Wow.
I guess this did go all the way to the top.
I'm calling the dean right now and giving him a piece of my mind.
No, wait.
Garrity.
Does the Theater Department have any of those prop guns that fire blanks?
Of course.
We did a modern retelling of Macbeth set in gangland Chicago.
Oh, fresh take.
And you think I'm lazy.
Prop guns?
Jeff, what do you have in mind?
A little demonstration for the dean on the dangers of trying to educate me.
He doesn't like fake classes?
Well, he's about to get a real lesson on the fact that Jeff Winger never learns.
Here he comes.
Get set.
You wanted to see me?
Oh.
Hi, Mr. Professorson.
His real name is Woolley.
And he's defrauded your school to the tune of dozens of credits per year and nearly twice as many dollars.
That's serious.
Fortunately, I'm a big believer in second chances.
I'm not.
Annie!
Annie.
Oh, my God!
You shot him.
Of course, I shot him.
He was being dishonest.
And if there's one thing Greendale's taught me, it's What the hell?
She had a gun.
It was a fake gun.
We staged this to get back at you.
Oh, you're the deceiver, Jeffrey.
Yeah?
Well, now you're the dead guy.
Jeff, what are you doing?
Why do you have a real gun?
Why did you shoot the dean?
Well, he shot you.
Not really.
He and I were in on this from the start.
He found out you were faking a class he came to me and we cooked up this thing to illustrate the slippery slope of academic fraud.
You know what you actually illustrated, Annie?
How to be a crappy friend.
Once it was obvious the dean had orchestrated everything, it was even more obvious the dean was too stupid to orchestrate anything.
Mm-hm.
So on a hunch, I called him and we hatched a plan to teach you a lesson or two about friendship.
But, Jeff, I only did it because I love you.
Well, when you love someone, you have take them as they are.
People aren't playthings, Annie.
No, they are not.
Look who's talking.
After everything you've put me through?
Okay, where did you get that gun?
There were only three prop guns.
I live in a terrible neighborhood.
Annie, put the gun down.
After we kissed, I waited all summer to see you.
You buried me like a shameful secret.
- Whoa.
- What's the matter, Jeff?
Afraid crazy Annie would go crazy for you?
Well, guess what.
Annie's got a gun.
Annie, just put the Annie, what have you done?
If you love Jeff Winger so much, why did you conspire with me against him?
I don't know.
I can't keep track of any of it anymore.
I just keep teaming up with whoever suggests it.
Glad to hear you admit it.
Aah!
Aah-aah!
When I called you to ask you to double-cross Annie, you didn't hesitate.
Do you understand what a conspiracy is?
If you conspire with every person, you're not even really conspiring with anyone, you're just doing random crap.
I know, I'm sorry.
I just I just want to have fun with you guys.
I go crazy cooped up in my little office and Time travel is really hard to write about.
Okay.
If I'm keeping track right, we should be done.
I'll just take these back to the Theater Department.
Police!
Drop the weapons!
Down on the ground.
Don't shoot, don't shoot!
Please, they're fake.
Those were prop guns.
Well, I guess it just goes to show you, prop guns belong backstage.
And scene.
You have got to be kidding me!
Professor Garrity told me what all of you were up to.
Made me mad.
Guns aren't toys.
Fact, in 100 percent of all fake-gun-related shootings, the victim is always the one with the fake gun.
Hey, Sean, you got breakfast plans?
I do now.
So, Sean?
We're still on for Thanksgiving, right?
Just talk to your father, Craig.
Would that this hoodie were a time hoodie.
Hey, dean, how about that credit?
- No!
- Damn it.
I'm not sure what lessons we've managed to teach each other, but I'm proud of Annie.
She took to deception like Abed took to Cougar Town.
It's really good.
Especially when she went off-script.

{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
To you We only sang the last two words.
What happened to the "happy birthday" part?
He's a Jehovah's Witness, doesn't celebrate birthdays.
We kept the language on the cake compliant.
"Hello during a random dessert," the month and day of which coincide numerically "with your expulsion from a uterus".
You guys.
I never cry, but All right, happy expulsion, Troy.
But after cake, we cram, for realsies.
Guys, finals are coming up.
This group is starting to use occasions to avoid studying.
Last week we had fondue and played Boggle because Shirley's niece took her first bath.
With bubbles.
Thank you, it's a milestone.
Funny, last week was my birthday and nobody noticed and nobody cared.
Pierce, you don't remember the huge party we threw?
We need to talk about those painkillers.
I don't think you remember anything Huge party, you were like, "The best party of my life".
- Nutritious.
- Got you!
Of course I remember my birthday.
What a party.
Yeah, you still owe me for the keg deposit.
Oh, you think I don't know that?
Troy.
Troy.
"Kickpuncher: Detroit"?
No way, this is sold out everywhere.
Not everywhere.
I got a cousin in Detroit, they're not crazy about it.
This is how you turn 20.
Thanks.
There's strawberries under there.
Let me help you.
I broke my legs, not my gender.
Okay.
While we're watching this unfold, some birthday facts to enjoy.
Troy's birthday is tomorrow, December 4th.
Also born that day, Tyra Banks, Marisa Tomei and French cinematographer Claude Renoir.
- Yes, jackpot.
- On the Chinese calendar, Troy is a horse, like me.
Purposeful, self-possessed and gregarious.
No, I'm pretty sure I'm a snake.
I remember, I'm determined, self-possessed and mendacious.
Pierce, what is this, what are you doing?
Explain yourself.
Who made this crappy cake anyway?
A cake maker at a cake store.
He did it wrong.
Troy, we're 1990, we're horses.
I was born in '89.
Then you were born 21 years ago.
Which would make me 20 because everyone is 10 for two years.
Because fifth grade is really hard for everyone.
Mom, how many lies have I been living?
Troy, do you realize at midnight, you are turning 21?
As in the legal drinking age.
Whoa.
This party just became unacceptable.
We're going out.
You were just complaining about too many parties.
Lame ones, this is real.
What makes it real?
Think of it as Troy taking his first bath, only the bubbles are his manhood.
Yes.
I wanna bathe in manhood.
Aw.
Aw.
I'm taking you to L Street.
Ugh.
Douche Street.
Oh, of course you hate cool bars.
I don't suppose you've ever even been to L Street.
No, but I also haven't been to Beirut.
But I'm sure I will go one day because I hear they have lots of important cultural - It's my birthday.
- Unlike L Street, which is douchey.
Let's hear your great suggestions.
The Red Door.
Oh, yeah, the Red Door.
The Red Hipster.
Not hipster.
Hipsters haven't discovered it yet, it's underground.
Why don't we go someplace fun, like Peg Leg Pablo's?
They serve virgin mudslides.
Those are milk shakes.
All you think about is yourselves.
Think about me.
I'm 19, I can't get into bars.
- Well - I'll bring you a mudslide.
Okay, well, have fun.
Fine, I'll get Annie an ID.
A fake ID?
Real, it just won't be yours.
I will see you at the Red Door.
Nice try.
We're not going to Red Poet's Society.
We're not going to Douche Street either.
Name the least offensive bar you've ever been to.
One, two, three.
Flannahan's Hole.
Flannahan's Hole, done.
Troy, you riding with me?
Do you even have to ask?
Do you wanna ride in my van?
I'm not disabled.
I don't need people helping me do normal things and doting over me.
Why don't you just leave?
Okay, I'll beat you there.
I don't think this girl looks very much like me.
Come on.
She's a white brunette.
So is Anne Hathaway.
Go on.
What's your friend doing with other people's IDs?
People sell their ID when they're leaving the state and need cash.
So she's a drifter.
A floater.
An urchin.
Caroline Decker from Corpus Christi, Texas.
Texas?
Do I need an accent?
You don't need an accent.
- Howdy, y'all.
- I'm Caroline Decker.
- Please don't do that.
- I guarantee.
That's Cajun.
I should research Corpus Christi.
Annie, relax.
I'm not a relaxed person, Britta.
I think ahead.
I prepare.
I don't improvise my life like Caroline Decker.
Who probably has really bad credit and an unfinished mermaid tattoo.
What?
Flannahan's Hole is closed.
That's not a I'm not being clever.
I mean it's out of business.
Well, that's what they get for trying to please everyone.
So now what?
There's a place at Third and Water.
It's fun-divey but not staph-infection-divey.
It's either got a gross name or an ironically fancy one, possibly both.
Oh, The Ballroom.
Good.
Go to Third and Water.
Wait, what?
Wasn't the deal.
Shirley's pushing.
Why, because they don't have plastic menus?
Why, because they don't Don't repeat that.
Jeez.
Look, just The women are your problem, and the men are going to The Ballroom.
And now I guess I am being clever.
So plastic menus are bad?
See, this is the kind of stuff I need to learn.
Plastic menus seem like a great idea to me.
You spill something, your mom says, "Troy, you're ruining Fuddruckers for everyone".
Troy, you're entering the next chapter of your life.
Sadly, it's the final chapter, but it's also the longest, and if you play it right, the best.
You and I, we're just two guys now.
Peers.
Equals.
So awesome.
Maybe later you'll let me drive your car.
No way.
No.
Hello, former enemy.
He's 21 at midnight.
Cool?
Yeah, happy birthday.
Thanks.
I don't like this place.
Ugh.
You've made that clear, Shirley.
Oy vey.
Caroline Decker from Corpus Christi.
You don't need an accent.
My ID says Texas.
They'll be suspicious.
They're not gonna question your ID, you're a hot girl.
We're good for business.
The hotter you are, the more they'll risk the fine.
Howdy.
All right.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Can't be too careful.
I understand.
Hey, hey, Shirley.
Welcome back.
You don't know me.
Okay?
Yeah.
You don't know me.
This place is all right.
Yeah, it's okay.
These must be of all the regulars.
You think someday I could make it up to this wall?
I don't say this often, Troy, but dream a little smaller.
Can I get you guys anything?
Oh!
Uh I'm okay.
Another Macallan, neat.
Vodka, neat, four olives.
- I'm waiting till midnight.
- Aw.
Sweetie?
- Water.
- Oh, where's that accent from?
Corpus Christi, Texas.
78418.
- What are you doing in town?
- Not much, I reckon.
Just drifting, floating.
Spitting in the wind.
General waywardness.
Alrighty.
Annie, you're in the bar.
You don't have to be from Texas anymore.
I don't know how it works.
I'm not a barfly, Britta.
They have "Asteroids".
Slide out.
Okay.
Okay.
Oh, okay.
I'm gonna go take a little look around.
Me too.
Annie, don't accept any drinks.
Or invitations to the bathroom.
So, what are you gonna order for your first legal drink?
What should I get?
Whatever.
No wrong answers.
I like beer.
Don't order beer.
You've had beer.
What should I get?
What do you think you might like?
It's your world now.
Follow your heart.
My Uncle Carl played a big role in my life.
He taught me how to throw a football.
He passed away this year.
His favorite drink was a seven and seven.
Don't order that.
That's an awful drink.
A high-school drink for girls.
Actually, I'll have a root beer instead of that water.
Sure thing.
Thank you kindly.
Y'all are so nice in this town.
I'm Caroline.
From Corpus Christi.
I grew up on a trout farm.
Deedily doo.
Doo-doo-doo.
Oh, careful.
You score any higher on this, the Rylans are gonna recruit you to fight the Ko-Dan Empire.
The Last Starfighter.
Did you get the 25th anniversary Blu-ray?
Was Scorpius half-Scarran, half-peacekeeper?
Frell, yes, I got Starfighter on Blu-ray.
You're a fan of the sci-fi original series Farscape.
Can I buy you a drink?
You got some ID?
Very funny, punk.
Get out of my way.
I don't know how people like you even get jobs.
Do you need help, man?
Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?
Heh-heh.
A little turning of the tables?
The turning of what tables?
I don't know, leave me alone.
So I punched her.
Right in the face.
Your probation officer?
Didn't you get in trouble?
Hell, yes, I got in trouble.
Wasn't the first time, won't be the last.
I'm not exactly known for my sound judgment.
Back in Corpus Christi, they call me Capricious Caroline.
What's "capricious" mean?
It probably means I'm too busy living life to be learning $5 words.
Ha-ha!
Hot damn.
With an aged Scotch, never use ice.
Never use ice, got it.
Why?
Destroys it.
At most, what you want, two drops of spring water.
Activates the flavor.
Good Lord.
Do they have the rules to poser drinking on the wall at L Street?
Do they?
Poser drinking?
Hey, Ms. Vodka-Neat-Four-Olives.
What's that called?
The too-cool-to-care-tini?
Is it?
The forced starkness of that drink order turns horn-rimmed heads at the Red Door.
I can't wait to understand these arguments.
Hey, y'all, another round.
Everybody holding up?
I'll be back in two shakes of a rabbit's ass.
Who the hell was that?
I gotta go see a woman about the female equivalent of a horse.
Classy.
Way to show Troy the ropes.
Shut up, L Street.
That woman is a hurricane.
Yeah.
Hurricanes are bad, Troy.
I know.
I think the wormhole Crichton fell through moved him across not only space, but time, which suggests Sebaceans are our future selves and Crichton is longing for a planet that no longer exists.
Huh.
Hey, you're really nursing that beer.
What kind of wormhole could move you one place to another within the galaxy on the same day?
Speaking of wormholes, what do you say we use one to teleport this conversation someplace a little more private?
That doesn't make sense.
Wormholes and teleportation are different.
That's what I've been talking about.
I noticed.
Cheers.
I followed that band Phish, spells it with a P-H.
I just lived in parking lots.
I don't like their music, did it to see if I could.
And guess what.
I could.
So, what now?
I don't know.
Even if I planned it, plans just fall off me like chicken crap off an armadillo.
Annie's the one that plans things, not me.
Annie's my friend.
She goes to school here.
Thinks she's got it all figured out.
She wants to major in health care management.
What does that even mean?
No idea.
I'll tell you what it means.
It means a master's degree.
Followed by an internship.
She's got the next 15 years of her life all mapped out and all she's gotta do now is just follow it or screw it up.
Another soda?
Actually, give me a screwdriver.
I got no place to be.
What am I, Annie?
The first season, it's better than the third season.
The fourth season, when you watch Okay, um, what's your name?
Abed.
Abed, I'm Robert.
Hey, Robert.
Abed, would you like to have gay sex with me?
No, thank you.
Wow.
Okay, so, what is wrong with you, that you can sit here this whole time and never pick up on the fact that a man is hitting on you?
Oh, I actually did pick up on it after a while.
And?
I really like talking about Farscape.
It's a really good show.
Stargate is better.
Battery depleted.
Oh, man.
Wait.
You guys, you guys.
Hey there, what you been up to?
I was just praying for these poor souls in these photographs.
Oh, that's nice, but, um, you missed one.
We found it in the ladies' room.
Give that to me.
No, no.
Come on, don't feel bad.
This makes us like you way more.
You think this is really funny?
A little.
I had some bad years.
- With a chaser.
- Come on.
It's a funny picture because you act so perfect all the time.
And because you look like a zombie.
But it's not funny when you're sad.
We're on your team.
Relax, sit down.
It's my birthday.
Give it to me.
Give it to me.
I will see you all on Monday.
Sheesh.
Mm-hm.
Boo Town.
Shirley, wait.
What?
Nothing, get out of my way.
I can't get out of your way.
I'm stuck in this The chair broke I mean, I can't get Could you please help me?
Pretty please?
Thank you, Shirley.
You're welcome, jackass.
Hey, it's my birthday and technically I'm not allowed to drink it for another 45 seconds.
It'll be 30 seconds by the time I'm done saying this, but can I have a seven and seven?
It's on the house.
Happy birthday, kid.
I'd rather have my eyes gouged out.
A radio playing would be horrible My big boy.
Big, big boy.
You're my big boy.
Troy.
I think I owe you a birthday.
I'm cool.
I actually always wanted to drive this thing.
What?
Oh, is this my car?
Don't crash it.
I'm not gonna crash it.
Crash it, Troy.
Go to sleep, Britta, go to sleep.
Crash his car, Troy.
This seems like a dark chapter in our story.
Go to sleep, Abed.
Cool.
Hey, that's the place that we should've gone to tonight.
- Yeah, L Street, exactly.
- That's the Red Door, stupid.
Do you see a sign that says L Street?
L Street is too cool to have a sign.
It's called L Street after the street it's on.
The Red Door is on L Street.
L Street has a red - Hey.
- It's the same bar?
You two have been saying one bar's lame and the other one is awesome all night, and it's the same bar?
Well, he probably goes there on Friday nights, which is lame.
You wish Stop, just stop.
I just spent the last two years thinking that you guys knew more than me about life, and I just found out that you guys are just as dumb as me.
Duh-doy.
Yeah.
Duh-doy.
Got it.
Duh-doy.
Duh-doy.
- You can take me home first.
- I only live a few blocks from here.
You do?
Annie, this is a really terrible neighborhood.
Yeah.
This is my apartment.
Weird night, huh?
Yeah, alcohol makes people sad.
It's like the Lifetime movies of beverages.
I pretended to be a different person.
Abed does that three times a week.
I did it because I didn't wanna be me.
I did it because I'm not sure who I am.
We went to school together for four years and you didn't even know me.
Yeah, but I know you now.
You're Annie.
You like puzzles, little monsters on your pencil and some guy named Mark Ruffalo.
You're a fierce competitor and a sore loser.
And you expect everybody to be better than who they are and you expect yourself to be better than everyone.
Which is cool.
Good night.
I guess everyone's gonna be embarrassed on Monday, huh?
Nah.
Everybody just got a little bit drunk.
Nobody did anything that bad, right?
No, wait, wait, wait.
What are we doing?
Yeah, what are we doing?
This is a bad idea, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
I flew off the handle earlier.
I apologize.
They were making out.
Abed.
Why would you do it in front of me?
I'm not a coat rack.
Abed, no one likes a tattletale.
Happy birthday, Troy.
Thanks.
You're a man now.
- Don't think this will be big enough.
- Just try it, we're close.
All right.
Breathe in.
All right.
Arms.
There we go.
There we go, yeah.
One hundred and fifty-seven.
Yes.
We did it.
That you?
Yeah.
Little help?
Hurry.
I think it's a girl.
Left side or right side?
Left side.
Got it.
Tell me when I'm close.
Okay.
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Ahem.
It's that very special time of year, Greendale.
A time for me to remind you that your school acknowledges no specialness to this time of year.
You do, of course, have a constitutional right to lend this season the significance of your choosing in any of our designated holiday zones.
Merry Christmas.
Don't you mean season's greetings?
Shirley, you know it's Christmas.
As a Christian, I've learned to be sensitive to other cultures' jealousies.
What are we doing this year?
I'm taking a relaxation course next semester.
I was gonna use the break to do the reading in advance.
I'm shutting myself in with my video games.
Fake-murdering people is gonna be my new holiday tradition.
Hm.
This is disappointing.
What do you care, Abed?
You're Muslim.
Don't your people spend this season writing angry letters to TV Guide?
True.
Religiously, I'm Muslim.
But I've always been a fan of Christmas.
And this is the most important Christmas in history.
I'm assuming that's why we're all stop-motion animated.
I vote we let it go.
What did you say we were, Abed?
We're stop-motion animated.
I don't understand.
I never understand what any of you are saying.
You guys don't see it?
I noticed it this morning.
That's how I knew it was special.
We've clearly entered a new medium.
Does "clearly" mean the same thing to you as it does to normal people?
It's probably Arabic for "not clearly.
" Ha, ha, ha.
Huh?
You really expect me to tarnish the high-five for that?
You guys really don't see what I'm seeing?
That worries me a little.
I think it worries all of us.
Is there something that we can do to help you with your situation, Abed?
You could move around more.
Not much point in being animated if you don't.
And I think we should commit to the format.
Starting with a song.
You start.
I'm sure we'll join in.
# Give me the snow Light up the trees # # Deck every hall And wall you can see # # Roast every nut Mistle the toe # # This needs to be the best Christmas Since the original # # Twenty thousand years from now # # They'll say The most successful Christmas # # Was today ## Okay, we got him.
He's down.
Now, how many fingers am I holding up?
And, more importantly, are they still made of clay?
Three, and I told you, we're not clay.
We're silicone dolls with foam bodies over ball-and-socket armatures.
Fascinating.
And publishable.
And you say you have no memory of this morning.
You don't recall the crisis that caused you to take shelter in this delusion.
It's not a delusion.
Very, very publishable.
Abed, I've been a professor of psychology here at Greendale for many years.
And I think I see a solution to this that might also help you with your situation.
I'd like to do extensive sessions with you, including hypnosis.
I don't need therapy.
Nobody said you did.
I just think it would benefit you and, incidentally, me to get to the real meaning of all this.
You're right.
I need to find the meaning of Christmas.
Ah.
Well If I can, everything will go back to normal.
Asterisk.
Abed.
The dean says if you don't get help, they might kick you out of school.
Why would I wanna be in a school that hates Christmas?
He's got a point.
Kidding.
# Sad quick Christmas song # # Sad quick Christmas snowman # # Tragic day gone wrong # # Sad quick Christmas song ## I don't suppose you know the meaning of Christmas.
Apparently, it means getting fondled by singing mental cases.
My snowman is alive.
I'm not a snowman.
I'm Chang.
What the hell's wrong with you?
I thought I made you.
Yeah, you made me need to cry in the shower tonight.
It's a text from Britta.
She says, "The meaning of Christmas is in the study room".
Now that you started it, how about 10 more seconds on the third button, eh?
You lied to lure me into group therapy?
Surprise.
Pierce.
You promised not to do that.
Surprise.
Not cool.
Ah, hold on, Abed.
I'm not just a psych professor.
I'm also a Christmas wizard.
You are?
I am.
And I can help you find the meaning of Christmas.
Right, guys?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, this feels safe.
Shut up, Winger.
What do you think, Abed?
Christmas wizard.
Hm.
I guess I can see that.
Have a seat, then.
Nothing to be afraid of.
All your friends are here.
They just want to help.
I'm here for the cookies.
So, what do we do?
With your permission, I'd like to put you into a state of Christmasnosis and take you on a magic journey.
To Winter Wonderland?
Sure.
Your own personal Winter Wonderland.
Come on, everyone.
You all know how magic Christmas journeys work.
You are playing with so much fire.
Shut up, Winger.
Hands on the table.
Eyes closed.
Heads relaxing.
Necks relaxing.
Don't relax Pierce any lower.
Screw you.
Abed, focus on the sound of my voice and let yourself relax.
With each breath, you'll feel It's beginning.
All right, then.
The table's moving.
Like a rocket about to take off.
Now it's leaving the floor as the walls and the ceiling fly away.
We're in outer Christmas space.
There's Planet Holly.
And Planet Jolly.
Oh, and what's that up ahead?
Ah.
It's Planet Abed.
Subtle.
We're descending onto Planet Abed now.
It's the most Christmassy planet in the universe.
Its atmosphere is 7 percent cinnamon.
Oh.
We're here.
Winter Wonderland.
See how sparkly?
What, are you crazy?
All I see is the study Ooh.
Sparkly wonderland.
During our journey, you've transformed into Christmas versions of yourselves.
Jeff-in-the-Box.
Uh-huh.
Troy Soldier.
Cool.
Do I have a gun?
You have a drum.
Cool.
Britta, you're Britta-Bot.
Uh Just go with it.
Bleep, bloop.
Teddy Pierce.
Bleep, bloop for me too.
Ballerannie.
Oh.
Heh.
Baby Doll Shirley.
Baby what?
What the hell?
Well, we are making fabulous and unexpectedly intense progress.
Now, what I'd like to do is visit the cave of frozen memories.
Pass.
Let's head for the North Pole.
The meaning of Christmas will be there.
Um Well, yeah.
Yeah, sure, cheers.
And I actually think I know a shortcut to the North Pole through the cave of frozen memor We can take Gumdrop Road and stop at the cave.
I wouldn't call it a shortcut, but you got us here, so I'll throw you a bone.
# Come with me and walk with me # # And see what we can find # # Accompany me on a journey with me # # Through the wonderland in my mind ## Let's move, folks.
This isn't going to be fun, easy or safe.
Shut up, Winger.
Mm-hm.
A journey through Winter Wonderland tends to test your commitment to Christmas.
So when I say test, I mean Wonka-style.
I'm talking dark.
My advice: Stay honest, stay alert, and for the love of God, stay between the gumdrops.
Look up there, Abed.
I think I see the cave of frozen memories.
A great place It's actually the cave of frozen peas.
It's a common mistake.
Don't worry, I got this.
Terrific.
Abed, did you say my Christmas self was a baby?
Are you sure you didn't say I was a Christmas angel?
Because you respect me too much to imagine me as a baby.
Maybe if you cry enough, he'll change you.
You know why you were a robot, right?
I'm progressive and kick-ass.
How about heartless and godless?
I think he gave us random identities.
I mean, me, a ballerina?
It's not like I'm that thin and graceful, right?
Annie, it's because you're fragile and tightly wound.
Cut the chatter, and keep your eyes on the prize.
We're looking for the meaning of Christmas.
I happen to know the meaning of Christmas.
And I'm the only one here that does.
So I would appreciate a level of respect even if I'm a guest in your therapy wonderland.
Therapy?
I am freezing Shirley with my wand.
And I am ejecting her from Planet Abed with a remote-control Christmas pterodactyl.
Oh, nice.
Now we're talking.
Point being, if you're not interested in helping Abed, there's no reason to be here.
Cookies.
# Swaddled in her diaper # # High upon her throne # # The queen of Christmas babies # # Thought that Christmas was her own ## That's wonderful.
Let's get back to the magic journey and wrap up.
Some of us have women to sleep with.
You guys hear that?
Humbugs.
Humbugs?
Yeah, a whole swarm of them.
See?
Everyone stay perfectly sincere.
Humbugs are attracted to sarcasm.
Wow.
Somewhere, Tim Burton got a boner.
Jeff, don't be sarcastic.
Oh, are they on me now?
Oh, no.
They're eating him alive.
If only he could find the power to not be a smug douche.
Oh, no can do.
I'm just a horrible guy.
Guess I'll have to go get laid.
Ooh.
Can I sing this one?
# Bitter shallow hipster Sweater matching socks # # Christmas needs more presence Than a haircut in a box ## Annie, nice.
Get what I did with the word "presence"?
Carol Canyon.
Instead of oxygen, plants produce Christmas songs.
Will it cost a lot to walk here?
No.
Public domain.
You know Jesus was born in the middle of April, right?
The church moved his birthday so they could steal the solstice from pagans.
Season's greetings from Britta Perry.
Maybe you could sing a song about it.
I don't sing.
And if I did, I wouldn't sing Christmas songs.
I guess that means you're gonna have me ejected for not loving Christmas enough.
Nope, not for that.
Let's get to the cave of frozen memories.
- Man, it is cave-like in here.
- What do you mean, cave-like?
It's a cave.
Nothing to be afraid of.
The cave of frozen memories is a safe place where we can observe suppressed experiences without being affected by them.
Can you show me how to do it?
Sure.
Here.
I'm focusing on a part of the cave and I'm seeing my 10th Christmas.
All right?
Now you try with this morning.
I can't see your 10th Christmas.
How do you know that's you?
Well, it's my house on What room are you in?
What color are the walls?
Our living room.
Cream-colored plaster.
There's an oil painting of a forest above the sofa.
I'm reading Paddington books.
Mom got me Paddington every year.
Where's your dad?
It's Christmas.
Where's your dad?
I don't know.
We never know.
Mom won't stop crying.
I'm going to America with Grandma.
He is good.
We lost our wizard.
We don't need him, never did.
And nobody needs this cave.
Initiate self-destruct.
Self-destruct initiating.
This slide goes directly to Pine Tree Station.
We can catch a train to the North Pole from there.
The wizard didn't bring us here to find the meaning of Christmas.
And I can't have anyone going beyond this point that's on his side.
With you to the end, man.
Always.
Like I said, I came for the cookies.
Ahh!
I'm not ejecting you for not liking Christmas music.
I'm ejecting you for lying to trick me into therapy.
Abed, they will kick you out of school.
I was trying to save you.
# Britta-Bot programmed badly # # Wires with fraying ends # # Functioning mad and sadly # # No faith in herself # # Or friends ## Bye, Britta.
Damn.
It got real up in that memory cave.
I know, right?
Speaking of real, this has been great.
But the cookies are gone, and I have to take a giant leak.
We should be at the North Pole by 9:00 Eastern Candy Time.
You guys see the countryside?
There's the Menorah Mountains.
And Jehovah Witness Bay.
Thanks for adding that, man.
This is nicer than all the Christmases I ever celebrated.
But you're Jewish.
On my mom's side.
But my dad's Episcopalian.
And before the divorce, the holidays were a minefield of overlapping rituals.
I like the rituals.
My parents are divorced too.
My mom's Polish.
She loves Christmas.
Every year, she visits on the same day.
December 9th.
Every year, we sit and watch Rudolph, the Red-Nosed Reindeer.
Together.
Every year.
But, Abed, today is December 9th.
It's the last day of classes.
Yeah.
That can't be right.
She comes every year.
Today must be December 8th.
Because she comes every year.
Okay, Abed.
Time to stop the train.
After you emasculated me in the ice caves, I went to your dorm room.
I know what happened now.
It doesn't matter.
I just need to get to the North Pole.
Abed, there is no North Pole.
We're in the study room, and I'm not a Christmas wizard.
I know.
You're a Christmas warlock.
You're trying to destroy Christmas because you blame your sadness on it.
I'm crawling out the window.
No, you're not.
Snap out of it.
Whoa, whoa.
Who taught you therapy?
Michael Jackson's dad?
I am a professional.
And you are tampering with a highly-delicate book deal.
I mean, human being.
- Oh.
Now we're losing him.
- I'm on the roof of the train.
Oh, great.
Well, I'm teleporting there.
Because I can do that because I'm a wizard.
Bloink.
Abed, there is no train.
This is not real.
- I can't hear you.
- I'm going to the front car.
You're very clever, but it stops here.
There's no more journey.
It's just you against reality.
And reality always wins.
Abed, I'm unhitching the cars, okay?
What?
Oh, give me a break.
Do you know what you're doing?
Bloink.
We're learning to teleport.
And we're helping our friend find the meaning of Christmas.
You're actually grabbing me in real life, delinquent.
We'll keep him away, Abed.
Go.
Find the meaning of Christmas.
At the very least take notes.
Oof.
All right, where are we?
Christmas train?
I didn't wanna go home.
It's depressing there this time of year.
What are we looking at?
Santa's workshop.
Okay.
So meaning of Christmas, right?
You see it?
Well, can't it just be anywhere?
Like, there?
Good job, Pierce.
It's the first season of Lost on DVD.
That's the meaning of Christmas?
No, it's a metaphor.
It represents lack of payoff.
Correct.
Thinking there was something you could do to save Christmas, turning yourself into an animated character in search of the holiday's meaning, these were mechanisms you used to escape this.
This Christmas card.
Left where you dropped it on the floor of your dorm.
"Abed, I can't make it this year".
I have a new family now.
You'll meet them one day.
You're a man now.
Take care of Dad.
"Wash your dupa".
Mommy's moved on.
New family.
New life.
There's nothing left to do now but heal.
And share the experience with as many reputable journals as possible.
Great, look what you did to the kid.
What's your article gonna be called?
"Worst Shrink Ever"?
Hey, this is not my fault.
This is what Christmas does to people.
We put too much meaning into it, and it lets us down.
We beg to differ.
What are you doing back here?
Saving Christmas.
Everybody, point your magic Christmas weapons at him.
Oh, brother.
This is ridiculous.
You are enabling a delusion.
The delusion you're trying to cure is called Christmas, Duncan.
It's the crazy notion that the longest, coldest, darkest nights can be the warmest and brightest.
Yeah, and when we all agree to support each other in that insanity, something even crazier happens.
It becomes true.
Works every year.
Like clockwork.
Try telling that to your catatonic friend.
I got a better idea.
Why don't we sing it?
Wait, what?
Let's not go overboard.
Will you commit to something?
Let's sing it.
Yeah, let's sing.
Can we sing while we blow Duncan away?
Absolutely.
Ow!
Ah.
Ah.
- You start, Britta.
- Mm.
# Christmastime is a time to sing # # That's what Christmas is for # # Christmas can even be A Hanukkah thing # # That's what Christmas is for # # And for a huge percentage Of this God-fearing planet # # It's about the birth of Jesus Christ # # But for the rest of us It's still a good time # # To remember That it's good to be nice # # Music and cookies And liquor and trees # # That's what Christmas is for # # Video games for two straight weeks That's what Christmas is for # # Hanging out with the people you love # # And saying I love you # # That's what Christmas is # # That's what Christmas is # # That's what Christmas is for ## And Christmas pterodactyl.
All right, all right.
I'm leaving.
Initiate self-destruct.
Don't you think that's a little bit?
I get it.
The meaning of Christmas is the idea that Christmas has meaning.
And it can mean whatever we want.
For me, it used to mean being with my mom.
Now it means being with you guys.
Thanks, Lost.
Wow.
I feel so much better now.
I guess we don't need to be stop motion anymore.
Well, why not just keep it going for the rest of Christmas?
It just feels so right.
You ever get the urge to just?
Merry Christmas.
Oh, there.
I said it.
Uh-oh.
We're stop motion again.
Oh.
Don't worry, man.
I did this.
You did?
Yeah, it's cool.
Huh.
Why?
Well, I always liked the way fake food looked on those animated shows.
Get a load of these things.
They stepped up a notch in terms of visual deliciousness.
I know what you mean.
Look at that perfect bite.
It's odd that I see this too though.
Yeah.
We're weird that way.
I'll say.
Ah.
That's better.
So weird.
# Troy and Abed in stop motion ##
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
- Really?
Hi!
- I looked everywhere.
Hey.
Hey.
Happy New Year!
Hi.
Everyone have a good break?
I discovered a new muscle to work out.
Ladies, you'll thank me come tank-top season.
I checked all of Pierce's wardrobes for portals to magical worlds.
All I found was something called Emmanuelle in Space on laser disc.
I couldn't watch it but it sounded sexy.
"Laser disc".
I joined a group that cleans the city.
We picked up litter and dredged the river.
Dredged it for what?
You know, garbage and stuff.
Tires.
Condoms.
Needles.
Ha.
At one point we found a finger.
Why are you using your l-Iove-butterflies voice?
What?
Am I?
I don't know.
Volunteer work is nice.
You do nice things with nice people.
Ooh.
Somebody's finding river fingers with a cute boy.
What?
No.
Well, okay, yes, but it doesn't matter.
It's not like I'm seeing anyone.
There's just a guy.
Is it the Russian guy that looks like a short Johnny Depp?
Is it the guy who looks like Vince Vaughn but smells like fish?
I don't wanna talk about it.
I have someone in my life that I'm happy to talk about.
Again with the Jesus.
Jesus is always in my life.
But things have been looking better every day with my ex-husband.
Is it the guy that looks like Anderson Cooper?
No.
Is it black Michael Chiklis?
- No.
- White George Foreman?
You guys are talking about the same person.
He's bi-racial, his name is David, and he's a human being.
Stop guessing.
It's just a friend.
Change the subject.
- "Chang" the subject.
- Aah!
What are you doing up there?
It's the beginning of a new semester of anthropology.
I'm here to get what I was promised.
Sure.
Who has Chang's pile of nothing?
You know what I mean.
I am sick of the runaround.
I'm here to demand an answer about whether I'm joining the study group.
If we have to give an immediate answer, it would have to be no.
Take your time.
Sleep on it.
Then get back to me, or else.
Jeff, you did say we would let him in eventually.
That was before he started using his name as a pun.
It makes me so Changry.
Oh, God, it's happening to me.
Let's get back to who Annie's in love with.
Is it Fat Neil?
- Bluestreak?
- Optimus Prime?
I know some of these are Transformers.
Who cares?
Let's just study.
We haven't had our first class yet.
Can we talk about something other than Annie's love life?
We could talk about my love life.
Is it Jean Claude Van Overbite?
We should learn people's names.
I agree with brown Jamie Lee Curtis.
Duncan's late.
I hope he didn't drive his car into another marathon.
How can you wanna date your ex-husband after what he did to you?
He apologized.
Oh, he apologized.
I guess that completely un-bangs that stripper.
Well, forgive me for being forgiving.
Oh, that's right, you don't know how.
I'm relieved Shirley is seeing her ex-husband and not Chang.
Why would she be with Chang?
Why do I have to say everything I'm thinking?
I wish my mouth was further away from my brain.
I wish my brain had its own brain.
I wish Chang hadn't had sex with Shirley.
What?
When?
Where?
How?
I can't talk about it.
Troy, I'm your roommate.
I can keep a secret.
Remember that Halloween party that none of us can remember?
I don't remember anything we can remember.
Well, Chang left me a message that night saying they did it.
But you can't tell anybody.
You have my word as your roommate, and that is a bond I will never violate.
You can't tweet it either.
We never discussed new media.
Sorry all that stuff got dragged out about me having a crush on somebody.
Why would you be sorry about that?
You know, awkward.
You don't think I actually care, do you?
No, I just didn't want you to think I thought you cared.
Greetings, welcome to your second semester of anthropology where it is about to get real.
Now, I forget where we left off last year.
Uh Fat Neil.
The Bronze Age?
Thank you, Fat Neil.
Neil's fine.
Not from an actuarial standpoint.
Now, please forgive my lateness, but I wasn't sure how to find Greendale sober.
Yes, you heard me right, I have stopped drinking, mainly due to the fact that I could no longer get an erection.
Now that I'm on the wagon, you can expect both this class and my penis to be more focused and rewarding.
Also, there's gonna be more than one diorama.
- Ugh.
- Lame.
I am so sorry.
I train seeing-eye dogs and today was graduation.
I couldn't leave without shaking all their little paws.
Rich.
Jeff.
Rich.
Annie.
Annie?
Rich?
You're taking anthropology?
You made it sound so fun.
We spent the holiday break dredging a river together.
We found A finger, yeah.
Hmm.
Sounds gruesome, but I'm used to seeing that kind of thing.
Because I'm a doctor.
That's terrific.
You're valuable.
I can't believe Rich actually enrolled in our class.
It means he likes me, right?
Why wouldn't he?
He is so sweet.
Yeah, sweet and wise.
He has lived such a long, full life.
How old is he again?
Thirty-something.
He has a landline and uses the word "album".
You don't think he's too old for me?
No.
No, come on, by that logic I wouldn't have a shot with anybody at this table.
Ugh.
Speaking of creepy, sober Duncan is worse than drunk Duncan.
This class is about to get really hard.
I have an idea about that.
Rich is really smart and he knows a lot about anthropology.
If we start studying with him, it could help a lot, plus, you know Heh-heh.
Oh, you know what, though?
I just realized.
So unfair to so many people, right?
Britta, you're always talking about how we have no one of Latin descent.
Pierce, you're looking for someone old enough to find your racism subversive.
I could go on and on.
There's a process.
It takes time.
Well, then I say we gather all the candidates and make an informed, democratic decision.
We can have a mixer, invite the people we're submitting for consideration.
All in favor of tonight?
Oh, I am.
Thank you, I'm finished.
No, I'd say you got about two more good years.
Oh, everyone, this is Andre.
My ex-husband and boyfriend.
He came to spend the day with me.
Hey, nice to meet you guys.
I've heard a lot about you.
We haven't heard a lot about you or what you've done or with who.
Well, I hope you give me a chance to make up for everything you haven't heard.
Hey, how about a round of soft serve on me?
Isn't he handsome?
Shirley, I've been fed a lot of soft serve by a lot of guys.
Sometimes it's rent money, sometimes it's Chili Peppers tickets.
And, yeah, I'll admit it, one time it was a gym bag full of nickels.
But it never lasts and they never change.
Britta, I'm a grown-ass woman and I made my decision.
How do you know it's the right one?
Because I'm pregnant, okay?
I was going to wait to share my exciting news, but now's a good time to tell you that I am eight weeks along.
Which is a little surprising.
Halloween.
- What?
- Nothing.
Thanks for coming, fellow anthropology students.
For the first semester, you knew us as "that study group".
But tonight, we wanna get to know you.
Please forgive the spread.
The vending machines haven't been restocked.
So help yourselves to Tropical Skittles, cigarettes or mouth wash.
And have a good time.
Okay.
I have to figure out if Shirley did it with her ex-husband the week after Halloween.
How are you gonna do that?
I got moves.
So bun in the oven.
Guess it's no surprise, after working on it.
I wouldn't quite say working on it, just kind of happens.
Oh, yeah, I do.
Especially when the season's right.
Oh.
Dead leaves.
Pumpkins everywhere.
Nature's Viagra, right?
I guess.
And then when all the pumpkins just start to rot and all the children have removed their outfits because they've already gotten their candy.
You know, I'm gonna go talk to some other people, all right?
So?
His mind is like a fortress.
Why not tell Shirley, "Look, you slept with Chang," and let her deal with it?
If someone had sex with Chang and get to not remember it happened, that's a gift from God.
I'm not taking that away from her.
Here's a good reason.
You ever find parsley in your teeth that your friends hadn't told you about?
Now imagine your teeth are a uterus, and the parsley is a half-Chinese baby.
Hey, guys, I want you to meet someone.
My name's Quendra, I spell it with a Q-U.
She's thinking about taking anthropology.
So maybe she would make a nice addition or two to our study group.
Something to consider.
Are you Abed?
I love Star Wars.
That's Troy.
I love footballs.
We're dealing with heavier things than your shameless lobbying.
Rich brought kettle corn.
Kettle corn?
That's a fun-time snack.
I make it in my garage.
I spell kettle corn with a Q-U.
Well, don't.
What is this?
What's going on?
It's a mixer.
Why is everyone from anthro class here?
Are you guys picking a new study group member?
You didn't invite me?
Didn't know how to reach you.
What are you talking about?
I'm everywhere.
We didn't know how to reach you.
That's not true.
That's a lie.
We didn't know how to reach you.
It's a mixer.
It's a mixer.
It's a mixer.
Works every time.
This is so good.
- Fifty dollars?
What a pig.
- You can't make this at home.
Jeff, I think we should vote now.
Most people left after we ran out of Skittles.
And, come on, it's pretty obvious Rich is the best candidate.
Yeah, looks like he's our guy.
I'll be right there.
This can't be happening.
I agree.
You can't talk, then do a slow clap.
You don't know that.
But I know this.
Unless you want a front row seat to Annie loves Richie, it's time to "Chang" your point of view.
It's not even clever.
You keep using it as the word "change".
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Just do me a favor.
Let me do all the talking and follow my lead.
Deal.
Seriously, do you have brain damage?
Rich is also board-certified in pediatrics.
Once a month he flies down to volunteer in the rainforest fixing children's cleft palates and teaching them acoustic guitar.
Other than that, well, his kettle corn speaks for itself.
I couldn't agree more.
Looks like this is an open-and-shut case.
Did someone say case?
Because I haven't made mine yet.
What?
What's your case?
Ben Chang is my case.
You can't be serious.
Oh, I'm serious, baby.
I am Yahoo Serious.
I'm Serious FM.
Welcome to the World Serious of Seriousness.
Sponsored by Honey Nut Seri-os.
Are you stalling right now?
Stalling?
Ha-ha-ha.
Stalling.
No, Annie.
In fact, you're gonna wish I was stalling.
Oh, I just got it.
Thank you.
Oh.
I wanna say some names to you.
Want some?
Jeffrey Dahmer.
Ted Bundy.
Rich.
What do they have in common?
We don't know them very well.
What do we know about Ben Chang?
We know he's nuts.
Let him finish.
We know he's dangerous.
Unpredictable.
Selfish.
We know he uses his name to make bad puns.
Guilty as Chang'd.
When he talks, he over- and under-emphasizes words at random.
When he eats, he holds his fork like a murderer's knife, gnawing at its skewered payload like a deranged woodland rodent.
Bring it home.
He smells like Band-Aids.
We know he dresses like a Cuban cab driver.
We know he exhibits Nay, flaunts, proudly, obvious symptoms of over half a dozen disorders you wouldn't wish on your worst enemy's pets.
Feel the heat.
We know these things about Ben Chang.
And so much more than we ever wanted to know about him.
Why?
Because it's there.
It's on the surface.
What you see may be what you don't want, but it's also what you get.
Wow.
Who is this kettle corn popping phantom?
This human question mark?
This number eight scoop of vanilla tapioca with a PhD in Being Swell and a masters in Everybody Loves Me?
Who is it?
We may never know.
I only know one thing.
Nobody is this good a person.
And nobody can get any worse than this.
He's horrible.
Now.
Who's voting for Chang?
Who's voting for Rich?
Uh Shirley.
Oh, wow.
What you gonna do, baby?
I don't know.
Shirley, this is the best kettle corn I've ever had.
If you don't vote for Rich, I'll shatter your world.
You gonna what?
I'll shatter your world.
I heard you.
I vote for Chang.
Yes, yes.
In your face.
Yes.
- No.
No.
- Yes.
Chang and Shirley had sex on Halloween.
- Huh?
- What?
What?
What?
You may be pregnant with his baby.
No, no, no.
Mm-mm.
Pierce!
She crossed me.
Is that why you were interrogating me about my sexual activity?
Troy?
Chang left me a voicemail on Halloween to say that you two did it.
I could hear you in the background.
Shirley, what is he talking about?
I don't remember that night.
Nobody remembers anything.
Oh.
Now I understand these photos.
Do you mind if I forward these to my brother?
Oh!
I want this man out of here.
Well, you just voted him in, so What is wrong with you?
Shirley is in crisis.
This isn't silly anymore.
I don't understand.
Just wait, baby.
I don't understand either, but we can work this out.
We'll figure it out.
Andre, no.
I think that this is a good time to go.
Rich, no.
You finally did it, Jeff Winger.
You finally hurt this group in a way that will never heal.
Kettle corn.
There you are.
Can you explain to me what you've been doing?
Well, Annie, when a man loves food and beverages very much, and they pass through his system I'm not in the mood, Jeff.
Explain your behavior with Rich today.
Sorry not everyone is as in love with Dr. Do-No-Wrong as you are.
And don't say it's because I'm jealous of him.
Oh, come on, Jeff.
I'm sick of this.
One minute, I'm too young to date, the next, you're trying to get rid of guys I like.
Either you want me, or you don't.
What's it gonna be?
I wish I could give you an answer that makes sense.
Relationships are complicated.
And we're in the men's room.
Fine.
Well, I'm gonna ask Rich out.
Nothing complicated about that.
There you are.
Did I walk into the wrong bathroom?
You have to find Andre and talk to him.
Shirley is devastated.
Since when do you want him in her life?
I'm not a fan of the guy, but I'm a fan of Shirley and this is what she wants.
There you are.
Mezzanine?
Hmm.
Nice sweater.
Mm.
My dad gave it to me.
So, um Look, I'm not mad at Shirley.
You're not?
No, I'm mad at myself.
You know, if I hadn't left her like I did, none of this would've happened.
You ever have something that you didn't truly appreciate until you didn't have it anymore?
Oh, yeah.
Keristina.
Old girlfriend?
Almond facial scrub.
They only make it in Finland.
The old me would have been long gone by now.
I didn't think I could ever change but the love of a good woman makes anything possible.
Looks like I'm gonna be a daddy again.
Yeah, but Hey.
It doesn't matter who the baby's father is, I'm in for the long haul.
If it's mine, he's gonna be a great football player.
And if it's Chang's, we'll go for golf.
Hey.
Hey.
Annie just texted me.
She asked Rich out.
Cool.
He said no.
He said she's great, but too young.
Don't say anything until I've said what I gotta say.
I've known you for almost two years now, and I've never taken you as seriously as I should have.
You are the strangest, coolest, most genuine person I've ever met, and the thing that scares me about you is how good you make me wish I was.
Help me, Rich.
Help me become like you.
I mean, I am so amazing, but I'm not perfect.
You are.
Give me that power so I can abuse it.
Heh.
Jeff, you are one funny bunny.
You can't just fake being good in order to get away with doing bad things.
I completely understand.
And do you understand that I still have to try?
And if you don't help me, you're a bad person.
You got me there, guy.
Come on in and dry off.
Oh.
Smells delicious.
Are you baking?
Yeah, muffin tops.
Today we'll show you how to make kettle corn with Dr. Rich.
How do I get one of those giant spoons?
Well, actually, I carved this one myself after lighting struck an oak tree in my backyard.
And then, I made my nephew a rocking horse.
Nice.
Smells heavenly.
That's adorable.
What sets your kettle corn apart?
Well, it's a secret ingredient, a couple extra pinches of love.
Oh.
You can't beat that.
That feels good.
Not this again.
Rich, you know they're doing a fake morning show.
- There are no cameras.
- I know.
It's just a fun way to start the day.
So grab a paddle, partner, and hop on in here.
You know what, that does sound Yeah.
# Troy and Abed in the morning ##
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
Hey, Buzby, how are you today?
Not so great, Bumbleton.
I have a ton of pollen to collect, but I'm really tired.
Flying a little low?
Maybe you should get high.
Who's this?
This is Drugs.
Aren't Drugs bad?
No way.
Drugs are like special honey.
They give you a buzzzz.
Don't call me honey, honey.
Pierce, Drugs doesn't say that.
You know, I don't say anything, by the way.
I mean, I thought this show was about drug awareness.
Who's gonna be aware of a character that has no lines?
Also, I noticed on page 15 I get flushed down a toilet.
- Consider yourself lucky.
- Annie, question.
Does marijuana help people work faster?
I thought it made them custom-paint their vans and solve mysteries.
Are you sure that my costume was on backwards?
Somehow, I felt more confident before.
I have a question.
I don't think my character would say "tripping balls".
That's not a question.
I don't think my character would say "tripping balls," okay?
Let's remember why we're doing this.
If our work helps one kid make better choices, then it will all be worth it.
I wish I had seen a show like this.
Might have helped me avoid mistakes.
We're happy to do this for you.
But my school had plenty of shows like this and I think sitting through them drove me to drugs.
You don't respond to anything appropriately.
Thank you.
Dean dong.
Heh, heh, heh.
I'm just checking in to see how the Greendale Anti-Drug Players are doing.
I talked to the guidance councilor at San Ramon Middle School.
There's gonna be at least 50 at-risk rug rats coming here tomorrow for your big world premiere.
- That's terrific.
- That's nice.
With any luck, we'll get rid of all those Charleston Chews in the vending machines.
Dean Pelton, were you hoping to participate in the show?
Oh, I would love to, Annie.
But as you can see from my outfit, I have plans.
So off to the airport Ramada.
How come he gets a front stinger?
Do you think bees eat their own honey?
- I'm sure they've at least tasted it.
- This guy keeps texting me.
You don't like him?
I don't like flirting in text.
That's like saying you don't work by electric light.
You want an active sex life, part of it's texting.
- I don't remember asking your opinion.
- Can't talk now.
Shirley, since I might be the father of your unborn child I made you a mix tape.
I hope you like Johnny Gill.
And since you probably don't have a cassette player, here's a list of used ones on Craigslist.
Britta, are you walking out of this room?
Uh, yeah.
Hey, you know you're gonna have to acknowledge him eventually.
I don't know who you're talking about.
Chang.
I don't know who you're talking about.
He doesn't exist.
Annie.
Ooh!
I'm sorry.
A word?
Mm-hm.
I don't know if you know this, but I did TV commercials for Hawthorne Wipes, family business, in the '50s.
Oh.
Heh, heh.
I was kind of the Gerber baby of moist towelettes.
Heh, heh.
That's great, Pierce.
Yeah.
I've done a lot of acting workshops.
Hm.
I do physical comedy, funny dances, foreign accents.
Accents?
Name any country.
Russia.
There are many tools I can bring to the table that I think the script may be wasting.
Do you know what I think is really great about this show?
The only real star of it is the message.
Right, of course.
Is the message Jeff Winger?
He's on every page of this thing, and I'll see you tomorrow.
You bet.
Britta left her phone.
She's getting a text message.
Let me see.
Oh.
It's from Marcus.
"I'll be at the show tomorrow night.
Can't wait to see you.
Are you really wearing a cat costume"?
Well, Marcus, you are in luck.
What are you doing?
Dragging Britta kicking and screaming into 1997.
What'd you say?
"There's not much to the cat costume.
But can't wait to show you what's underneath".
How could you think that's a good idea?
I got a better question.
How could it not be a great idea?
Thanks.
Here you go.
Wha?
Pierce, what are you doing here?
Never mind that.
There's a rapist in the hallway.
That's my landlord.
And If he wanted to rape you, you'd be raped.
Did you follow me?
Let me answer your question with two of my own.
What are you doing in an apartment above Dildopolis?
And when did they open a second location?
This is where I live.
It just happens to be above a marital aid store.
I don't get it.
Aren't everyone's parents rich?
Well, I'm not speaking to my parents.
After my breakdown, my mom wanted to put the problem behind us and I wanted to deal with it, so I went to rehab and she cut me off.
What are you living on?
I saved.
Every penny from babysitting, every birthday check.
Every dollar from the period fairy when I was a kid.
I guess I thought it would last longer.
Excuse me, what's a period fairy?
The fairy that gives you a dollar every time you get your period.
Does she still come?
Pierce.
You know, you and I are very much alike, Annie.
We're both realists.
We're both cute.
And we'd both rather die than let someone else control us.
I see the point of this place now.
This crap hole is a monument to self-reliance.
I found the drapes in a dumpster.
Can you believe it?
Heh, heh.
Yes.
You know, I wanna help, Annie.
Oh, no, no, no, Pierce.
Come on, now.
I'm not taking money from you.
It's not mine.
It's yours.
You've earned it for being strong.
It's going to drop into your hands from out of nowhere because I was never here.
I'm only taking this because I'm worried about making rent and the procedure for selling eggs takes weeks.
You save your eggs for a rainy day, and I'll see you tomorrow.
Pierce?
Hey, why did you follow me here today?
Oh, it was nothing.
It seems sort of pointless now.
I guess it was to talk about the play.
And who cares if I don't have any lines?
You know what, you should do that line you improvised.
"Don't call me honey, honey"?
Yeah, that's it, you should do that.
You were the Gerber baby of moist towelettes, right?
Yes.
Yes, I was.
And action.
Hello, I'm Cornelius Hawthorne.
One rainy day, my son Pierce and I were taking a stroll when I discovered the cleansing power of moist cotton fresh from the field.
Isn't that right, son?
It sure is.
It sure is, Dad.
Pierce, knock it off.
I want to be in the commercial too, father.
Well, then you should've done better in your damn audition.
What's your name, son?
Nigel.
You're a good boy, Nigel.
Your father is a lucky man.
Okay, guys, remember, the most important thing is to have fun.
The second is to know all your lines and not mess up a thing.
Actually, flip those.
Here we go, guys.
I took the liberty of juicing up some of our bits.
Um, but You can't just revise Annie's script.
And who uses Wite-Out anymore?
Why don't we look over Pierce's changes and see if they improve things?
Hey, Crayon, do you know where I can get some drugs?
I need them.
Unfortunately, you can get them anywhere.
- Anywhere?
- I'm here.
Zabadazooey.
- Good one.
- Ha, ha, ha.
Doesn't seem to hurt anything, so let's get into costume and break a stinger.
For the bees.
Annie, uh, I don't feel comfortable with the "zabadazooey" line.
The one you wrote?
I got it.
Let's give Jeff the zabadazooey line and I'll come in with "good one".
Yeah.
It's more in my voice.
I'm sure Jeff is gonna reject that idea.
Yeah, you're probably right.
You're the producer.
By the way, is this your pen?
I think I put it back in my pocket after I wrote you that check yesterday.
Ahem.
I'll give it to you later.
I'll talk to Jeff.
Also, I think it'd be better for my character if I wear his leather jacket.
Okay, welcome to Greendale's Drug Awareness Show!
Okay, our volunteers are handing out drug-free baseballs!
Huh?
Next time you think about drugs, think about baseball instead.
You can't ignore me forever.
Okay, you probably can.
I don't know why you want to.
My nephew Marcus actually goes to San Ramon Middle School and he's coming to see the show.
Marcus?
Your nephew?
He's 14.
I actually thought he didn't even like me.
But he texted me and he said, "Can't wait to see you.
I've been looking forward to this.
You are the coolest aunt in the world".
I hope that I don't let him down.
You'll be great.
What does this mean?
It's eight, an equal sign and a greater than symbol?
Let me see.
You better get changed.
I'll hang onto your stuff for you.
Right.
Abed, we screwed up.
You know that text we sent?
It was to Britta's nephew.
He sent her an emotipenis.
What are we gonna do?
Fine.
Screw you, Abed.
I can fix this.
"Marcus, I made a mistake.
I texted the wrong person last night".
"You called me by name.
It wasn't a mistake.
Don't be afraid".
Screw you, Abed.
"I was drunk.
We can't do this".
"I'm drunk too.
On lust".
There's a picture.
Oh.
That's disappointing.
Wow.
Who does that?
That's Bees, you're up.
Cool cats, you're on deck.
- Aren't drugs bad?
- No way.
Drugs are like special honey.
They give you a buzzzz.
Don't call me honey, honey.
Are you ignoring me because I'm Korean?
You're Chinese.
Oh, there's a difference?
Shh!
It's because you're crazy.
There's something wrong with you.
And the idea that I was with you means there's something wrong with me.
And if this baby If you have any humanity at all, you will not make me think about it.
Shirley, funeral.
Well, that answers my question.
Jeff Winger is sexy even in a coffin.
Hmm.
I'm here.
You're supposed to be on-stage.
I was looking for a lighter.
What are you wearing?
This is a funeral.
I got this, Annie.
Uh I can't believe Fluffy's dead.
I know I'm green, but I feel blue.
Look, it's Drugs with a crazy wig and sparklers.
Pokémon!
I don't think that's right, Drugs.
Nobody asked you, Crayon.
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.
Look what you've done.
Oh, yeah?
Well, look what I'm doing now.
It smells like something died in here.
Should we get the dean, call in a bomb threat?
Should we set off the sprinklers?
It's not that big a deal.
The kids are into it.
I don't think they're getting the message.
Do kids ever seem like they're getting the message?
I think it's sinking in.
It's your call.
And he's about to get flushed down a toilet in the next scene.
And he'll be done.
I wish I had never even met Drugs.
- Who invited the nerd from the beehive?
- Ha, ha, ha.
Drugs made you.
How about you leave, Drugs?
They want more.
I gotta go back out there.
But, Pierce, you were flushed.
That was the story.
That's what's supposed to happen.
Being flushed doesn't mean you're dead.
I could be a floater.
A floater is when you have a number two I know what a floater is, Pierce.
It just wouldn't make any sense in the flow of the show.
And it sends a mixed message.
Know what I think is a mixed message?
Yesterday you couldn't pay your rent, and today you can.
Come on, Annie.
You and I are alike.
We're independent, we need each other.
Bzzz.
Getting rid of Drugs was a great "ibee-a".
I'm flying higher than I ever have, thanks to not Drugs.
Argh!
Chuck it at his nuts!
- Hey!
- Ow!
Hey!
Hey!
I'm back.
Ain't no party without Drugs.
I love you, Drugs.
Yo, pass it this way.
We want Drugs!
Listen to that, Dad.
- They're high on me.
I'm a god.
- We want Drugs!
We want Drugs!
Where's that Nigel now?
And I haven't even used my penis material yet.
Pierce, enough.
We're going back to the original script and doing some damage control.
Damage?
The only damage is me blowing the roof off the universe.
I am not letting you go back on that stage.
Well, maybe I won't be visiting you late at night anymore with a generous spirit.
You sick, sick, sad old man.
This is why I didn't wanna take money from my parents.
I don't want anybody pulling my strings.
Wait, wait, is he giving you money?
Not anymore.
Pierce bought his way in.
Annie sold out her message.
You've been indulging this maniac?
Yes, I've been indulging this maniac.
- You're fired.
- Fired?
Next time I'm at Dildopolis, I will not be coming upstairs to say hi.
The only reason we did this was for you and your stupid ideals.
It turns out you don't even have any.
We supported you, Annie.
Yeah, Annie, you're fired.
I'm sorry.
Here's the situation.
We've got 50 at-risk pre-teens armed with baseballs, chanting for drugs, who just spent intermission eating nothing but Charleston Chews.
Thank God.
Hope you can top Act I, is all I'm saying.
Oh.
Hmm.
Whoops.
Should we bail?
Works for me.
Wait.
Listen to those kids.
We just created The least we can do is hit the reset button and get that number down to average.
That's a suicide mission.
Did someone say crazy person?
No.
No.
Well, I heard it.
We want Drugs!
We want Drugs!
Greetings, you little snots.
You're not Drugs.
Oh, but I am.
Disappointed?
Did you expect me to stay the same forever?
Because that's not what Drugs does, baby!
I'm gonna deep-fry your dog and eat your mama's face.
And I'm gonna wear your little brother's skin like pajamas.
I control your lives and there is nothing you can do.
Let's kill him.
Oh, bring it on, Bow Wow.
Get him.
Ah!
Is that all you got?
I gotta tell you, this is the greatest chemical-dependency program I have ever watched.
The way you got the kids to think that they needed drugs.
And then having them realize that dependence was the enemy.
That the price was just too high.
Genius.
So now that the show is over, what is the plan for these bee costumes?
Hey, Marcus.
I'm Jeff.
I'm, like, uh, Britta's boyfriend.
Look, dude, she started it.
She's just as into me.
No, listen, I'm not mad.
I was just fooling around and I sent those texts.
Gross.
Yeah.
It's disgusting, sending those pictures to your aunt.
More disgusting than what you texted to an underage boy?
I didn't know you were you.
I didn't know you weren't my aunt.
Okay.
Let's just call this a draw.
Britta doesn't need to ever know about this.
Okay, I'd be happy to, for a price.
That was brave of you.
I owe you an apology.
It was rude to call you crazy.
Maybe I haven't been giving you enough credit.
Oh, that's really sweet.
Tell you what, why don't I go get Chang, and you can tell him that yourself.
Heh, heh.
- Oh, no.
- My God, that was amazing.
Good job, you saved the day.
That's amazing.
Way to go, man.
Way to go.
- They beat the crap out of you.
- That's awesome.
It was okay.
I did a lot of ad-libbing Guys.
I'm so sorry.
Thank you so much.
That was amazing.
Even I learned something.
- Oh, Annie.
- We did it.
- Group hug, group hug.
- Oh, thanks.
- Way to save the day.
- Nice work.
- Oh, love you.
- Did you get hit in the face?
Before you say anything, I want you to know, even though I did nothing wrong, I'm still gonna give you money.
No, I can't take your money, Pierce.
I can't go from depending on my parents to depending on you, which is why I'm gonna get a job.
So you're cutting me off?
No.
Pierce, I know you don't depend on anyone, but you do depend on people depending on you.
So I'm not gonna take your money.
We're still friends?
Give me a day.
By the way, you're mom is the period fairy, right?
Hey, guys, I found my phone, but has anyone seen my bra?
- It's 2 a.m. - , time for Dildopolis' Night Owl Deals.
Please be advised, we will be closed for Presidents' Day.
Just kidding.
Dildopolis never closes.
At Dildopolis, your privacy is our top concern.
All store purchases will show up on your credit card as ABC Dildos, Incorporated.
Shopping till you drop?
Take a load off at our in-store cafe and enjoy an espresso or our signature cinnamon biscotti.
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Gather close that you might hearken the story of Fat Neil.
Born stout of heart but large of bone, his adolescent years were shadowed by scorn and mockery.
Hey, fatty, fatty.
Hey, fatty, fatty.
Outlets of fantasy afforded him some escape from the darkness throughout high school.
And as a man, he traveled far, to a new school and a new beginning.
Or so he thought.
- They're down there by Fat Neil.
- It's Fat Neil.
- It's Fat Neil.
- The name became a joke.
- I'll have what Fat Neil's having.
- The joke became his life.
Yes, Fat Neil?
And Neil fell again into darkness.
Only this time, his thoughts turned to an escape of which we dare not speak.
But pain need not be spoken to be known.
Not to all.
It was, strangely, Jeff the Liar, son of William the Barely Known, - who first became concerned.
- Neil.
It was Jeff who pretended to be interested in Dungeons & Dragons in an effort to lift Neil's spirits.
And when Jeff's fake interest resulted in Neil giving Jeff all his books, explaining he wouldn't need them anymore, it was Annie the Dayplanner, herself a recovering headcase, that recognized the signs of coming doom.
A council was called.
Troy the Obtuse.
Shirley the Cloying.
Hee-hee-hee.
I know.
Abed the Undiagnosable.
Assange is a modern-day Paine.
Britta the Needlessly Defiant.
For reasons that should be obvious, Pierce the Insensitive, known also as Pierce the Dickish, and Grandpa the Flatulent, was not invited.
The group agreed that what Fat Neil needed most was to feel like a winner for a change.
They would invite Neil that Saturday to a game of Dungeons & Dragons designed by Abed to help Neil reclaim his confidence.
For Neil.
At the end of the meeting, they realized that Chang had been there and felt too awkward to mention it.
What they couldn't have known was that they had just scheduled the most important game of Dungeons & Dragons ever.
A game which not only might save a life, but which would forever change the balance between good and Pierce.
Hi.
Hey, Neil.
This is gonna be awesome, yo.
We're gonna ignore that hate crime?
I'm a dark elf or a drow.
Shouldn't you be wearing armor?
Ha, ha.
I'm an elf, not a nerd.
You guys suddenly wanted to play Dungeons & Dragons?
Yeah.
Why wouldn't we?
- Yeah.
- It's cool.
And when you play it, it makes you happy, like a dragon.
Okay.
Hi, I am your Dungeon Master.
We will be playing this adventure, The Cavern of Draconis.
- Ooh.
- Oh.
Neil has a character named Duquesne that he's been playing for years so I made these for you guys.
Take your time.
Choose carefully.
They each have unique combinations of strengths and Alrighty.
Shouldn't there be a board or pieces or something to Jenga?
No, this is a role-playing game.
It takes place in our imagination.
Oh, Neil.
I tell a story and you make choices in the story.
Let's begin.
You're all standing on a country road.
The evil dragon Draconis dwells nearby guarding a massive pile of treasure.
Working as a team, your goal is to track down the dragon, kill him and claim the treasure as your own.
Jeff, your turn.
It's my turn?
Oh.
Um, what do I do, roll dice?
You tell me what you want to do.
Then I roll to see if you're successful.
What are my choices?
You're slowing things down.
Shirley?
I'd like to introduce myself to the group.
Hello, I am a dwarf named Zibbady Doo.
- I'm not the best at making up names.
- Oh, hey.
I'm "Mar".
- Boy, you weren't kidding.
- Hello, Mar.
My name is Bing Bong the Archer.
I'm an archer and such.
I'm Ew.
"Hector the Well-Endowed"?
Abed.
I didn't know you'd grab one at random.
I made that one with Troy in mind.
Yeah, I bet you did.
Okay, hi, I'm "Lavernica".
I have three armors, boots, belt, a torch Wait, let her finish.
Worst introduction ever.
Check it.
I am Brutalitops the Magician.
Ha, ha, ha.
Magic user, baby.
What?
An arrow flies through the air, almost hitting Brutalitops.
Six goblins are running toward you, drawing daggers.
Oh.
I attack them using my additional notes.
It has no effect.
Britta?
Why are these goblins attacking us?
Maybe these woods are their rightful land and from their perspective You're the AT&T of people.
You've been shot by an arrow.
Ow.
Yeah, it hurts.
Jeff.
Uh, I take my throwing knife and throw it, knife style.
You do 10 points of damage.
Look at that.
What am I not good at?
Sex.
But the goblins close in, surrounding you on all sides.
I draw my plus-three Sword of Duquesne and attack in a 180-degree arc.
The goblins are terrified as Duquesne draws his sword from its sheath and, in one move, slices the throats of three charging goblins.
- Oh!
Good.
- Rest of the goblins run away.
Great job with the sword.
You saved us.
What would we do if you didn't exist?
Dial it back, Lavernica.
Pierce, what are you doing here?
How about you answer that question?
What the hell is this little tea party?
We're playing Dungeons & Dragons.
First of all, gay.
Second of all, stupid.
And thirdly, why was this a secret?
Are you cutting me out of the group?
L I guess we must have forgot.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's what it was.
- Yeah.
- You remembered to invite Al Jolson.
And you remembered to let fatty sit in my chair.
Out!
You're stretching it.
Can we talk to you outside for a second?
Kind of missed that opportunity already.
Yeah, but there's a very specific reason.
Let's play.
I don't have a character for you.
I don't need a character.
I think you do.
Just put me in the stupid game now.
Okay.
Um As you watch the goblins retreat, you notice a 67-year-old naked man with no weapons lying in the wet grass shivering.
His name is Pierce Hawthorne.
And I'm 66, dick.
In about 13 turns, he will die of exposure.
Jeff?
I wait 14 turns.
Screw you guys.
I'm gonna win.
I go to the naked man and I give him my cloak.
Pierce, I am Duquesne, of Clan Duquesne.
Dumb name.
I'm going to take his sword.
Can I take his sword?
You've got his sword.
Pierce, knock it off.
You're playing the game wrong.
We'll see.
Okay, I take the sword from the man.
I attack him, I attack black face.
It's a critical hit.
Wha?
You decapitated him.
Brutalitops is dead.
What?
No!
Chang, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for your character sheet.
Still your turn.
I run.
What?
You run?
Naked man is running into the woods.
He has my sword.
Can we catch him, please?
The cloak was an elven cloak of wind walking, which is double-speed, so no.
He's gone.
Damn it.
It took me 10 years and 50 campaigns to get that sword.
Really?
Maybe I'll wipe my ass with it and throw it off a cliff.
That's for sitting in my chair, fatty.
I take it that means I'm winning?
Pierce, you've made your point.
You can ruin anything.
Now come back and give Neil his sword.
Can't hear you over the sound of me rubbing his sword on my balls.
Pierce.
Oh, ew.
You have successfully rubbed your balls on the sword.
Abed, don't help him.
You're the Dungeon Master.
Just kill Pierce and give Neil back his sword.
He's upset.
I have to be impartial or the game has no meaning.
Can you give Neil a new sword?
That sword is one-of-a-kind, forged by my ancestors.
I hump it.
That's it.
Pierce, Abed, I need to have a talk with you in the hall.
What?
Hey, hey.
That kid in there is severely depressed.
Is that what he told you?
He's been using that line since he was 5 years old to get an extra slice of pie.
What the hell is wrong with you?
I don't like being excluded, Jeff.
Do you?
Yes.
Now go in there and tell him you're giving him his sword or you are out of the group.
I'm sick of you threatening me and talking to me like a kid and giving me that look you give me like I can't get erections.
What?
Abed, I keep running.
Since you're working against the group, I need to separate you.
Good.
Who wants to sit with a bunch of fat cry-babies anyway?
Call me when you're ready for my next move.
Pierce refuses to give back the sword.
Our new goal is to find him and kill him.
I think I just wanna go home.
Neil, do not do that.
We're gonna get that sword.
Is there a way of moving faster than he's moving in his cape of whatever?
I guess if we had a Pegasus.
If that's sarcasm, I can't tell, because everything in this game is silly.
Um Abed, can we get a Pegasus?
I can't give you information like that.
Well, there's got to be a town nearby.
We will go to that town and ask around about a Pegasus.
Huzzah.
Is that right?
And so it was that the group began to describe themselves walking.
And as they described themselves walking, so did Abed confirm they walked.
I walk with them.
Until This is a local elf tavern, but all races are welcome.
Aw.
It's a crowded, rowdy evening.
Beleaguered gnomes hurry with mead for the thirsty elves.
Why are they beleaguered?
Who cares?
I find a waiter and introduce myself.
Why is he a pirate?
He only speaks gnome.
- Anybody here speak gnome?
- Oh.
I do.
Lavernica does.
This will be painless.
Hello, my friend and brother.
How can I help you, dear madam?
Oh, please, no need for such deference.
I'm no better than a gnome.
You are, madam.
You are a human warrior, which is five species classes greater than I. That's disgusting.
Don't talk like that.
I am so sorry, madam.
Please don't report me for execution.
Oh, no, no, I didn't mean that.
We've gotta do something about these gnomes.
Um Britta, ask the stupid gnome where we can get a Pegasus.
Did someone say "Pegasus"?
A word I understand in every language.
Okay, here's all the Dungeons & Dragons stuff I could find.
I had to carry it all the way from my car.
It's very heavy, and my doctor said Following the directions given to you, you arrive at a field of Pegasi.
- Finally.
- But they are guarded by a mysterious and beautiful elf maiden who seems drawn to Mar.
Oh, okay.
Well, I explain that we need a Pegasus and, I don't know, promise to fill it up before we bring it back.
She flirts with you.
I flirt back.
How?
I say something sexy.
Like what?
Abed.
Ugh.
Okay.
Excuse me.
I don't normally do this, but you are the most beautiful creature I've ever seen, and I would really love a Pegasus.
Ugh.
Works for me.
You're very handsome, you know.
Yeah, well, you know, I'm not really comfortable with this.
My stable has a bedding of heather.
You'd be more comfortable indoors.
Look at what you're doing.
Understand I don't want to.
- You've offended the elf maiden.
- She seems disinterested.
What?
All right, can we just do this?
Hi, hello.
I'm Hector the Well-Endowed.
You got a bunch of Pegasi.
Let's make a deal.
What kind of deal?
I take her by the hand and lead her to the stable.
Light a candle and rip off a piece of my tunic, which I fashion into a blindfold.
I'd like to, but I don't know if l Shh.
Shh.
Shh.
I place it gently over the elf maiden's eyes.
I slowly - Okay.
- You both fall back, exhausted but still entwined.
Great.
I stroke her hair lovingly and spoon her for the appropriate amount of time.
- How long is that?
- Cool, cool.
The elf maiden, thoroughly satisfied, promises you a flock of Pegasi.
- Oh.
Excellent.
- Take a break.
I should check on Pierce.
Pierce?
I'm here.
I need to know what you want to do next.
So many things, Abed.
So many things.
Guys.
I am bringing Pierce back into the room.
While soaring above the forest of Ingold you spot a body in an elven cloak in a clearing below.
Ha!
Oh.
We got you, dummy.
We land.
You land safely in the clearing.
He's face-down, a pool of blood underneath him.
I've dreamed of this moment, in the game.
Uh, Neil's sword?
Clutched in the hand is the sword of Duquesne.
Sir, I believe this is yours.
- Thank you.
- You get close to take the sword.
You can see that this body, while definitely dying, is not Pierce.
What?
I turn it over.
It's the gnome waiter from the tavern.
What?
No.
Why?
- Goodbye, my friend.
- Thank you for being so respectful toward me.
Who did this to you, Gnome Waiter?
I never saw his face.
But just so you know, My name was Kyle.
Kyle.
Britta?
He was an imaginary waiter.
I wouldn't expect you to understand.
Now.
You hear a low rumble on the other side of the trees, followed by a shrill screech and the beating of heavy wings.
Wait, wings?
What's going on?
Tell me, Abed.
Are you familiar with the Amburg region of the Edylmann river basin?
Of course, I am.
You know there's a reflecting pool with a very special amulet at the bottom of it.
An amulet that allows the wearer full control over Draconis?
The hideous Draconis, an all-powerful red dragon, crashes through the trees into the clearing.
Riding atop his shoulders, naked as the day he was born and controlling Draconis with the amulet is Say it.
- Pierce Hawthorne.
Scream what I told you to scream.
Pierce Hawthorne is my master.
Prepare to meet your doom.
I run towards Pierce with my broadsword drawn and I attack Time stop.
Time stop?
Draconis has tons of spells.
The six of you are frozen and helpless.
I wanted to play Chutes and Ladders.
Fine, Pierce, you win.
Just kill us and end this.
Oh, no.
Killing's too good for you.
Cast shape change on Duquesne.
What shape do you choose for him?
Fat.
Pierce, stop it.
Pierce.
- Duquesne starts gaining weight.
- How much?
Make him as fat as Fat Neil.
- Pierce.
- Oh, right, cry.
Let it out.
Baste your chubby cheeks in tears of gravy.
You weren't crying when you were stealing my friends.
They asked me to come here.
You know why, right?
I've got some fat news for you, Fat Neil.
Don't you know why Jeff Winger, of all people, led the charge on the Fat Neil feel-good committee?
Way over the line, Pierce.
I'll tell you why, because I was there.
Oh, they're down there by Fat Neil.
That's right, Neil.
Your new best friend, Jeff Winger, coined the name Fat Neil.
Jeffrey.
Neil, look, before you respond, I can make it up to you.
I'll find a fatter Neil.
Huzzah.
You made up Fat Neil?
Someone asked where the restrooms were.
You were standing by them, but you were also standing kind of near, uh, other Neil.
So call him Skinny Neil.
He's not that skinny.
He's bald, he's black.
I don't look at the world through that lens.
I shouldn't be high-roading you.
I'm the bad guy.
You can all hang out in suspended humiliation and think about what you learned today.
One, don't screw with me.
Two, invite me to your crap.
Is it my turn?
Yes, but you can't move.
That's fine.
For my turn, I feel sorry for Pierce Hawthorne.
Pfft.
Save it.
No, I really do, man.
Good.
For my turn, I rape the Duquesne family again.
- Jeez.
- For my turn, I pity Pierce too.
Trust me, kitten, I'm having the time of my life.
I won.
I won Dungeons & Dragons.
And it was advanced.
I pity Pierce.
Knock it off.
You really outdid yourself this week.
There's pain in you.
I seriously feel bad.
Feel sorry for your new fat BFF.
No, we're done doing that.
He's gonna be fine.
Aren't you, Neil?
You, Pierce, I really worry about.
At least for my turn anyway.
Well, how about this?
Draconis, unfreeze time.
Done, you guys can move again.
I breathe so much fire on you Hold it.
You just used your move unfreezing time.
Neil?
I take the sword of Duquesne, and I throw it at the amulet around the sad naked man's neck.
That's a difficult shot.
You'll need an 18 or higher.
Oh, sweet baby Jesus.
Come on, come on.
- Yeah.
Yes.
Woo-hoo!
Yes, in your face.
Sword smashes the amulet, freeing Draconis from its spell.
Red dragon turns his head, grabs Pierce in his jaws, swallows him alive.
Oh, no.
Oh, Neil.
He flies your band to his cavern where he bestows his treasure upon you.
Congratulations on the completion of Caverns of Draconis.
I've been your Dungeon Master.
I hope you had a good time.
Excelsior.
Awesome.
Awesome game.
Hey.
That was the best game I ever played in my life.
Don't mention it.
Wanna play again next week?
Maybe.
Okay.
I'll be around.
And so it was that Pierce Hawthorne saved the life of Fat Neil while learning very, very little.
Good night.
How could you want giant ears over a tail?
If you had a tail, people could tell you're happy.
You'd hear things from miles away and wear backpacks as earrings.
Free up your hands.
Backpacks already free up your hands.
Guys, what do you think?
Oh.
We thought our group was meeting now.
Tail is much better.
Ugh.
Thank you.
All in favor of giant ears: Hm.
Told you.
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Why does being a librarian make her hotter?
They're keepers of knowledge, she answers questions.
Like "Will you marry me"?
And "Why are there still libraries"?
I wanna be a book.
She could pick me up, flip through my pages, make sure nobody drew wieners in me.
Mm-hm.
Hey, maybe if we're too loud, she'll shush us.
Okay.
Books!
Pretend like you're asleep.
Jeff, what do you do when you and your best friend wanna ask the same girl to the dance, but neither have dibs?
You both fell in love at first sight.
I don't believe in dibs, love at first sight, love, best friends or doing things, but it's good you brought this to me.
Open your heart.
What if I don't?
I miss the deadline?
Valentine's, Crapentine's.
Opening my heart is on my list.
Pierce, what was that?
Gum.
Why aren't you chewing?
Because I'm using my mouth for this dumb conversation.
- Bye.
- Bye.
That's my friend, Page.
She's cool, but whatever.
She's cute.
Oh, Troy.
Heh.
Before you go barking up that tree, she might not be interested.
Why wouldn't she be?
Oh.
Is she a friend of Ellen?
Yes, Annie, but you can say the word.
Page is a lesbian.
Pierce, as someone who's been calling me a lesbian for the last year and a half, I'm sure you don't have anything to say about me being friends with one.
Nothing off the cuff.
What I do have is a prepared statement.
"And in summation, good luck and bon appétit".
Many, many paragraphs of that were oddly supportive.
Wait till you hear the one I have for you.
Okay, I know that wasn't gum.
You're right.
It was an awesome exit pill.
Zip, zop, zooey.
Bye.
We gotta do something about those painkillers.
He's recovering from broken legs.
He sure is.
Dude can moonwalk.
He's almost through his prescription.
Besides, he's a baby boomer.
They invented drugs.
Yeah, they also invented TV.
Have you seen him control one of those?
Intervention?
Intervention?
Count me out.
We can't.
He listens to you.
He also listens to the Barenaked Ladies.
Go get their dumb asses to help you.
- Back it up.
- Okay, Jeff.
You are clearly in a bad space today, but Pierce is our friend and the Barenaked Ladies are triple platinum.
Are you?
Why does everyone leap to defend that band so aggressively?
How much do we have to go through before my friendship stops being questioned?
Maybe friendship is about going through a lot of stuff.
And maybe BNL has two Billboard Awards to your zero.
Oh, okay, they're "BNL" now?
We need a shorthand for the Barenaked Ladies.
That's how fundamental they are.
Fundamental.
You know what Pierce probably needs more than anything?
Some space.
Maybe I do too.
Maybe we all need some space to pull the knife out of the back of the most celebrated Canadian alt-rock band of the mid-'90s, you selfish, jaded ass.
This is a fight.
We are fighting.
Jeff.
Hello.
I hear you're fighting with your group.
Correct.
You won't know this, being American, but tonight, Liverpool are playing Manchester United.
I'm a stylish American, professor.
I've been forcing myself to be into soccer since 2004.
Oh, then it's destiny.
God gave you a British friend and a massive TV for a reason.
Oh, it's Valentine's day.
Even though we're fighting, I did promise the group I'd go to the dance.
You promised the study group?
Whip crack.
I'll see you at precisely 6:30, or, as the English call it, gravedigger's biscuits.
Okay?
Ha!
That moonwalk back there was streets ahead, buddy.
Hey, thanks, buddy.
- Hey, Pierce.
- Hey, it's you.
Yeah, the tiny man you see when you take enough pills.
We have a good time, don't we, Pierce?
I ain't hurting.
And you wanna keep this going, right?
Because I'm sure you've noticed, the prescription is almost done.
Heh, heh.
I don't think the doctor You know, he won't Pierce, if doctors are so smart, why are there millions of them?
Look in your hand.
It's Valentine's, buddy.
Be mine.
Ahem.
Mariah, Abed Nadir.
My associate, Troy Barnes.
Charmed, I'm sure.
You're the guys who keep staring at me and yelling out "books"?
The very same.
We're both interested in taking you to the dance.
We are also best friends.
It is important we protect that friendship from the stresses of courting.
So we're trying to be direct.
Will you go to the dance with one of us, and if so, which one?
We need to get something straight first.
This is the cutest thing that's ever happened to me.
But I don't know either one of you.
Give us a moment.
New proposal: Get to know us at the dance and decide which of us you'd like to see again.
Okay, deal.
Nice.
What's in the briefcase?
Oh, tacos.
You want one?
No.
Great, we really wanted them.
Yeah, we're gonna eat them.
So, like, would you change clothes in front of her?
Annie, I know your lack of world experience creates curiosity, but questions like that can make you seem a bit homophobic.
It's homophobic to ask?
If you have to ask if it's homophobic to ask questions, haven't you already answered your own question?
Have I?
Don't know.
Not a homophobe.
Oh.
Oh, there's Page.
Should I ask her 500 questions about being a lesbian?
Or should I just treat her like a normal person?
That's a question you can ask.
- Hey, how are you?
- What's going on?
Hey.
Hi.
I'm not a lesbian.
Oh.
I'm not either.
Oh.
But it's cool that you're friends with one.
Oh.
Page isn't a lesbian.
She just likes hanging out with Britta.
It makes her feel cool to have a lesbian friend.
Heh, heh.
But Britta's not a lesbian.
She thinks that Page is.
Guess what, Annie.
Page and I are going to the dance together.
Hope I stay straight, right?
Oh, sorry, my friend's a tad homophobic, so I was doing a bit.
Oh Heh.
Bye.
Pretty exciting first half.
Yeah, zero-zero.
Electrifying.
Worried that your six-headed ball and chain will be calling?
Fine.
That's better, you big slut.
- It's Chang.
- Chang?
Why?
I don't know.
I can hear you guys.
- What are you doing here?
- How do you know where I live?
I can answer both of those questions by returning your driver's license.
Ah.
There it is.
Man U versus Liverpool.
For God's sakes, just let him in.
He's wearing the right colors and everything.
Come in.
Don't mind if I Chang.
Hey, hey.
Hey, man, check this out.
Ya-tah!
The thing I was going to show you guys was pretty cool.
I'm ignoring you and watching soccer.
Just sit down, Chang.
There's space for three fannies on this sofa.
In England, fanny means "vagina," right?
In England, everything means "vagina".
I'm gonna make it up to you.
Even though, like I said, weird place to put a lamp.
But let me order a pizza.
Ooh, I love pizza.
In England, we call them "Italian fannies".
I'm hooking us up.
Celly.
Uh, go use the landline.
Landline?
Okay, Grandma Bell.
Star-Burns.
It's Chang.
Remember that pizza you owe me?
Well, it's time to pay up.
Party at Winger's tonight.
Yeah, you can tell people.
Cool.
Cool.
Wingding at Wingers.
Wingding at Wingers.
So, Mariah, what you get with me is the complete package.
HBO, Showtime, Starz, Starz Black.
Sounds expensive.
With due respect to my friend, if you go with me, you can expect this on the dance floor: Go, go, go I feel like everyone's staring.
Not that I care.
Well, of course they're staring.
They've probably never seen a straight girl and a lesbian so comfortable together.
Exactly.
Those two were talking about us.
Well, let's give them something to really talk about.
Let's do it.
Okay.
Excuse us.
Thanks.
Sorry.
Cool music, huh?
Oh, nice call, ref.
Bite my banger.
Jeff, something's up with your toothbrush, man.
What the hell?
I had to get cleaned up.
Why?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
Pizza time.
Leonard?
Where are the white women at?
No.
There are no white women here, Leonard.
This is not a party.
Don't tell that to Magnitude.
Who's Magnitude?
Yo, yo, yo.
Pop, pop!
Ha, ha, ha!
Pop, pop!
Bam!
Bam!
Come on in.
What's up?
Oh, yeah, dog.
Looking good.
That is my analysis of the Saw movie franchise.
That about does it.
So I think it's time for you to choose.
Abed, could you get us some punch?
On it.
You guys are really cute together.
Thank you.
But, you know, having to actually choose, l Hey, we both agreed to this.
We're both comfortable with each other.
So I won't be No, I choose you, Troy.
Psssh.
Punch.
Hey, Abed.
Hey.
I, um She just, uh She chose me.
Cool.
You can have this, then.
Thank you, Mariah.
Have a great night.
Great.
Pierce?
You go straight to hell!
Wha?
Uh Heh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know, I've been going through all these mood swings lately.
You understand we care about you, right?
Hm.
Okay.
Well, look.
Here's the deal.
I am not sharing you with them.
So before this goes further, you have a choice to make, my friend.
Ha, ha!
Look at the lesbians.
Lesbians!
Screw you.
Screw you.
Heh.
Heh.
L No, no.
I don't care what they say.
Oh, I don't either.
I wish it wasn't such an issue for them.
Yeah, but that starts with us.
That starts with us.
I've never done this before.
Me neither.
Wait, what?
Wait, what?
Bring it.
So curious about one thing.
What was wrong with Abed?
Well, I mean, he did talk about the Saw movies for two hours.
Yeah, but there are eight of them and they're two hours apiece.
The first one did redefine the genre Troy, I would love to be his friend.
I know you would, it's incredible.
But romantically, he's You know.
I hate her, I hate her, I hate her!
What happened?
She called you weird.
I am weird.
Not as weird as her.
Who the hell is Nicholas Nickleby?
She wouldn't shut up about it.
Hm.
I know.
There's someone out there for us.
Happy Valentine's Day.
It is now.
Ignore her.
Okay.
It's weird, but I've never heard of Magnitude before tonight.
He's a one-man party.
You're always busy with your study group.
Well, he's not with them tonight.
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, yeah!
I thought you quit drinking, Duncan.
False alarm on that one.
Oh, yeah.
Pop, pop.
Pop, pop.
Pop, pop.
- Pop, pop.
Pop, pop - Yo!
Yo!
Yo I never said I was a lesbian.
Why didn't you just ask me?
What am I, a homophobe?
I don't care about people's preferences.
You so care.
You were hanging out with me because you thought I was gay.
So, what you were doing with me?
Hey, what does it matter, you know?
We're both just humans trying to make our way through this crazy world.
You're the worst.
What?
For the record, I never thought you were cool.
I only thought you were a lesbian.
Page is straight.
Really?
Well, when she was gay, I thought it was really cool of you to make out with her.
Thanks, Annie.
Come on.
Kiss her!
Annie.
Oh, thanks, man.
Just leave those.
I'll get them in the morning.
Oh, it's okay.
Are you wearing my underwear?
Oh.
I needed a pair while I did some laundry here.
I don't have a washing machine.
What the hell?
Okay, don't get mad, don't get mad.
I'm homeless, Jeff.
When my wife found out about Shirley and me, she kicked me out.
For good this time.
My whole life is in this dishwasher, man.
Well, some of it's also soaking in your bathtub.
Oh, so wasted and sleepy.
You know, I should probably just crash here and, you know, I can start looking for a place in the morning.
What?
You orchestrated this entire party so you could weasel into staying here.
You weren't gonna notice.
Don't kill the messenger, but you have four hermit crabs in your bathroom sink.
You'll fall in love with them.
I named one Jeff.
How long were you gonna stay?
Just a month, three tops.
I mean, how long is our lease?
Uh Uh Way to go, idiots!
All right, everybody out.
I'm not kidding.
It's been very interesting getting to know you all much, much better.
Star-Burns.
Leonard.
Magnitude.
Pop, pop.
Swizzle.
Scandalous.
C Dubbs.
Tim.
Mighty D. Glisten.
Good night, everyone.
Faster.
Move it.
Thank you.
Well, I hope you found tonight therapeutic.
Because I would love to pretend that that was my plan.
I actually started to have fun until that maniac tried to move in.
What is it about me that makes broken people flock to me?
Is it my height?
Do huddled masses mistake me for the Statue of Liberty?
I don't know, but being as how you are halfway through your second year at Greendale, you may want to either stop resisting, or admit that you're actually starting to enjoy it.
Well, you assume I enjoy it because you think you'd enjoy it.
It's true, I am very lonely.
You want a nice little taste of what you're missing in a relationship with six nutcases?
Yeah.
Let's turn on my phone and listen to the 39 messages they left tonight.
Hello.
You have no new messages.
Hm.
That's Hm.
Since you got it turned on, why don't you call me a cab and then pay for it?
They must be in some kind of trouble.
Ah.
What a relief that would be.
Tell you what.
If you need me, I'm gonna be waiting for my cab down here.
I'll have a special nap.
Oh!
Thanks, bro, I'll be gone in the morning.
Yeah, whatever.
Okay, maybe I'll stay a while.
Thirsty.
Don't push it.
All right.
It might not shock you guys to hear the real reason we had a fight today.
It wasn't about the Barenaked Ladies.
Although I do have some unresolved issues there.
Caring about a person can be scary.
Caring about six people can be a horrifying, embarrassing nightmare.
At least for me.
But if I can't say it today, when can I say it?
I love you guys.
Oh, and Pierce?
Take it from an expert.
These knuckleheads are right outside your heart.
Let them in.
Before it's too late.
Happy Valentine's Day.
Be mine.
Right.
Yes.
Love you.
Amazing.
You're cute?
Hm.
No, wait.
Kiss me.
There has got to be a way to make money off of this.
I've been cheating.
No, it says "E-mail me".
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
It's H-A-W-T Guys, what happened?
Apparently, they found him unconscious on a park bench.
Oh, my God, is he okay?
We don't know, we just got here.
He's ready for visitors now.
He's in 1023.
Hi.
Oh, welcome, my old friends.
Welcome.
Pierce, what happened?
We were all so worried.
It was the pills.
They just took me over.
I saw awful, horrible things.
Demons, Aliens, Critters 3, something called Bruce Willis' Surrogates.
- Abed, what are guys doing?
- It's okay, just act natural.
Pierce asked me to document his life for historical purposes.
At first, I said no.
At the risk of sounding overly sensitive, I feel bored by Pierce as a subject.
But I'm excited about the narrative of the documentary format.
It's easier to tell a story when you can cut to people explaining things.
I've called everyone here so that I could put my house in order, bequeath parting gifts, say my final words to each of you.
Final words?
You're gonna kill us?
No, dummy, the pills wiped me out.
I'm dying.
I'm not really dying.
Over the last few weeks, it's become apparent how little respect this group has for me.
So I summoned them here to exact my revenge.
See?
Fish in a barrel.
I'm so sad, I don't know what to do.
Usually if I need to cheer up, I just make fun of Pierce, but now it'd just make me sadder.
It's Gregory Hines all over again.
I'm sure he'll be fine.
You know how dramatic Pierce gets.
Remember when he had the hiccups and pulled the fire alarm?
Just relax.
He's here because we relaxed.
No, he's here because he relaxed.
A handful of pills at a time.
That's all over now, we're here for him.
So there's no point in feeling bad.
We know there's no point, we just felt like feeling it.
Yeah, Jeff, what are you, Abed?
Oh, sorry, Abed.
No problem.
Doesn't bother me.
Mr. Hawthorne is ready to commence his bequeathings.
Shouldn't you be telling that to an orderly?
He's gonna give us gifts.
Oh, cool.
I mean Cool.
I don't want Pierce to die, but if I'm gonna get bequeathed upon, I'd liked to be bequeathed a drum kit or a signed photo of actor LeVar Burton.
Those would be my top two wishes.
My third wish would be a million wishes.
But I'd just use them all on a million signed photos of actor LeVar Burton.
- Hello, Pierce.
- Hey.
Hi.
I got you some things from the gift shop to cheer you up.
I got you a John Grisham novel and a funny little coffee mug.
See how the flea's doormat says "Dog Sweet Dog"?
Shirley, we both know that you and I are the most hated in the group.
We do?
And since in my absence, you'll be the new black sheep or I'm sorry, that's offensive.
Black swan.
I want you to have this.
It's a compact record and it contains an audio file of your group talking about you while you're out of the room.
It's all here, burnt into this diskette by optical lasers.
I don't believe you.
It sounds like science fiction No, I don't believe there's anything on that.
Then I guess this is goodbye forever.
Goodbye, Pierce.
Smell you later.
He said it's a recording of you all talking behind my back.
That's ridiculous.
That's what I told him, because you all don't do that, right?
Mr. Hawthorne is requesting Sour Face.
Knock, knock.
Is that you, death?
It's Britta.
Oh.
I just wanna tell you that you don't have to give me anything.
I'm happy to spend time with you.
Know what Dylan Thomas said about death?
No, tell me.
Okay, bluff called.
You're the selfless one in the group, right?
Haven't thought about myself in years.
That's what makes you the perfect recipient of this bequeathment.
It's a check for $ 10,000, with the payee line blank.
So that you can give it to the charity of your choice.
Wow.
Pierce, this is surprising.
After what you gave Shirley, we thought you were playing mind games.
Thank you.
If you're so inclined, you could always write your own name in there.
Toodles.
I don't wanna die in a place like this.
People shouldn't die in the same place People magazines do.
I hope to die surrounded by my family.
Only way I'd agree to be by family.
Me and Abed have an agreement.
One dies, stage it to look like a suicide caused by the cancellation of Firefly.
We're gonna get that show back on the air, buddy.
How'd it go?
Huh?
Oh, fine.
He gave me a check for $ 10,000 to give to the charity of my choice.
See?
He's not messing with us.
Maybe he just hates Shirley.
What?
Yeah, maybe.
I need to research a few charities because some take a lot off the top.
You think you're giving money to people that need it, and you're really giving it to some middle man who's gonna pay off their parking tickets, credit cards, and keep from getting kicked out of her place in April.
Hah.
He'd like to see Annie next.
You know what?
No.
- He'll see Jeff next.
- But you're not Or what?
You'll do twice as much work as a doctor for half the pay?
Thank you?
Called a "complisult".
Part compliment, part insult.
He invented them, I coined the term.
See what I just did there?
That was an "explanabrag".
Hello, Jeffrey.
Pierce.
I've thought about this day many times, but I've always imagined it differently.
For starters, I thought you'd be the one in bed and I'd be a hologram.
What?
Never mind.
There's no time for that now.
It's starting to seem that you're using the social leverage afforded you by your alleged deathbed, to exact complicated acts of psychological vengeance on those closest to you.
Vengeance?
Oh, no.
I was never one to hold a grudge, Jeffrey.
My father held grudges.
I'll always hate him for that.
You get along with your father?
I got along without him.
Oh.
That's no good.
You don't want your dad to die before you tell him how you feel.
I'm sure.
Let's nip this in the bud.
Pierce, we're sorry we didn't respond quickly enough to your pill addiction.
Is there any chance that apology is enough?
Are you ready to be bequeathed upon, Jeff?
Yeah.
Blow my mind.
I found your father.
Did you now?
William Winger, born Oklahoma City, 1945.
divorced in 1983.
Most recently, residing in Dorchester.
Currently sitting in a Town Car on its way to this very hospital.
Should be here in an hour or so.
Give or take a father.
That it?
Yep.
All right, see you at the funeral.
And so it is bequeathed.
What are you gonna say to your dad?
I'm not gonna say anything.
I won't have to because Pierce is playing head games with us.
I've decided not to listen to it.
What?
I'm not gonna listen to the CD of you guys talking about me because I forgive you.
How do we know what we're being forgiven for?
We don't even know what's on there.
And you never have to.
Hmm?
What if he is coming?
What are you gonna say to him?
Here.
I'll be him, I'll be him.
Hi, hey.
Hi, I'm Jeff's dad, hi.
Hi, Jeff's dad, I'm Britta's dad.
What?
Why?
Got drunk, didn't have a condom.
And her mom gets freaky when she hears Oingo Boingo.
Wish I could relate but, like my son, I'm a closet homosexual.
Don't apologize.
You're talking to the guy that banged Britta's mom.
I have no standards.
What do you say we take a tumble?
You're under arrest, I'm an undercover cop.
It's not illegal to be gay.
It is here in Iran.
Not when we're in the Green Zone.
That's Iraq.
Well, what do I know?
I'm Jeff Winger's dumb gay dad.
My father was a two-bit con man of so little substance, he couldn't leave a trail if he wanted to.
I don't care if Pierce hired Scotland Yard, he isn't gonna track him down from a hospital bed.
Money can't just make people appear.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Troy Barnes.
Pierce Hawthorne sent me.
Hey, Troy?
Hi.
I'm LeVar Burton.
Pierce got LeVar Burton to come here for Troy?
Is there anyone he can't produce?
Now I'm really getting mad.
Why am I the only one he decided to torture?
I told Pierce a thousand times I never wanted to meet LeVar in person!
I just wanted a picture!
You can't disappoint a picture!
I hate you, Pierce!
Aah-hah!
I hate you so much!
Annie, I forgive you.
Annie Edison?
Your bequeathal is at hand.
Do you have a regular job here?
Annie, I know you're being strong for me, I give you permission to weep.
I'm crying on the inside.
Gross.
Well, in any case, I wanna give you this.
It's been in my family for six generations.
Now it's yours.
Thank you.
Wheelchair assist in Admitting.
Could I please have a wheelchair assist in Admitting, please?
Mm-mm.
Jeff, do you wanna see your dad?
He's not coming.
- But do you wanna see him?
- No.
Then why aren't you leaving?
Because I don't care and I'm not gonna let him think that I care.
- Your dad or Pierce?
- There is no dad.
And get this thing out of my face.
And don't you dare intercut this with footage of me freaking out.
Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
Is there footage of you freaking out?
Abed, I'm gonna kill you and Pierce and Britta and anyone else who thinks I care about any of this.
So do you go to school nearby?
Well, are you more familiar with me from Star Trek or Reading Rainbow?
Reading Rainbow was the show I hosted and produced for 25 years on PBS.
Ever seen it?
Oh.
Set phasers to "love me".
What does it mean?
What do you mean?
No riddles.
You're screwing around with everyone.
You gave me a tiara, what does it mean?
Are these blood diamonds?
Are they Holocaust diamonds?
No.
Well, what does it mean?
It means you're my favorite.
What does that mean?
I did it, I gave away the money.
The Red Cross.
You know what that makes me?
A terrible person, because if that camera wasn't on me, I would have taken that money right out of the mouths of crippled, starving, malaria-ridden refugee kids.
And now I know that forever.
Thanks, Pierce.
Britta, you've got to forgive yourself.
I've forgiven all of you for the horrible things Oh, for crying out loud.
We're gonna listen to it.
I don't wanna listen to it.
Britta, please.
Britta.
Britta, wait.
Britta.
I'll be right back.
Don't learn anything without me.
So how much do we all hate Shirley?
Pierce, knock it off.
Hey, James Bond, stop trying to record us with that stupid spy pen.
We can see the blinking light.
Why do you keep trying to record us bad-mouthing each other?
He thinks friendship is a competition , and he's trying to get the upper hand.
You think Shirley's any different?
Yes.
- Moron.
- Hello.
I guess we do owe you an apology.
We shouldn't have said those things about you.
I guess the lesson here is that I sometimes use guilt as a weapon.
What are you doing?
Oh, just shooting a talking head.
Or did you want me to be the only one who didn't have one?
No, go ahead.
I think it stems from when I was So you found my father?
Yes, he's on his way.
I mean, if this is too much to handle, I completely understand and I can call it off.
Actually, I think I'm ready to see him.
Good.
Good for you.
Oh.
I should probably tell you.
If you're lying to me, if my father isn't coming, if a car pulls up and anyone other than my father steps out, say, an actor, or you in a wig, if you pull any Ferris Bueller, Parent Trap, Three's Company, The Deadly Art of Illusion bull****, I will beat you.
And there will be nothing madcap or wacky about it.
Understood?
Crystal.
Hi.
Hey.
I'm LeVar.
Oh, I know.
I was a huge fan of Rebop.
It was canceled before I was born but I scored some VHS copies.
I was nostalgic from a very early age.
Cool.
Hey, you know, I assumed that Troy was a fan, but he hasn't said a word since I got here.
And now I've gotta catch this flight No, no, you can't go.
He loves you.
He talks about you all the time.
How much would it cost to change your flight till tomorrow?
Is $261 enough?
Because that's all I've got.
That's all you've got?
Yeah.
No, you keep your money.
I'll reschedule.
Oh, my God, Thank you.
He's gonna be so happy.
You know, you are a very generous friend.
But you're really stupid with your money.
It's not that I'm selfish, it's just that I'm really stupid with my money.
Which is why I'll never have a lot of it.
And because I'm a really generous friend.
Problem solved, dilemma deleted.
Britta for the win.
Oh.
Thank God he didn't take it.
Could you imagine bouncing a check to Kunta Kinte?
Hello?
Jeffrey?
This is your father.
Uh-huh.
It's me, here in this sedan.
See?
I'm waving.
I'm sorry I can't come any closer, my boy.
This is too difficult.
You look too much like your mother.
No, don't come closer.
As you were.
I have to catch a flight to Katmandu, but I just wanted to say cherish the new friends that you've made.
They're your true family now.
No, don't open It'll be too hard on both of us.
Aah!
- Son of a - Jeffrey, I'm dying.
Quiet.
- Jeff!
- No, no, no.
When you improvise a plan, sometimes you hit a speed bump, and sometimes you hit it so hard, that you soar through the air, far beyond your initial expectations.
I set out to take revenge on Jeff Winger, to scare him with the ghost of his father.
Instead, I took over the role of his father.
Helped make him a better man.
It'll be a long time before Jeff Winger underestimates me again.
Ha-ha-ha Ow, ow, ow!
Why would you do something like this?
- Come on, Jeff.
- What?
Because I'm sick of you people not taking me seriously.
You forget my birthday.
You don't invite me to your Dungeons & Dragons games or your secret trampoline.
You guys think I'm some kind of a joke.
This isn't disproving the theory.
Good point.
What'd you say?
- No, Jeff.
- What did you say?
Apparently, I need to say some things to my father.
Things that I may have screamed at Pierce instead.
I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it, but my father deserves it too.
Pierce?
I figured out your test.
Crowns, presents, punishments, favorites.
You're trying to show me the dangers of my own elitism.
My constant striving to be the best.
So I'm re-queathing this tiara.
If I become the person who thinks it's their place to pick favorites and torture the rest, I'll die sad and alone.
And that's what you were trying to teach me.
Very good, Annie.
You pass.
She's actually just my favorite.
I thought the documentary format would be like fish in a barrel.
But as is the case with a real barrel of fish, after a while it can become cramped, chaotic and stinky.
Fortunately, if your documentary is turning out just as messy as real life, wrap it up with random shots which, when cut together under a generic voice-over, suggest a profound thematic connection.
I'm not knocking it.
It works.
Guys.
Oh.
Aww.
Jeff and I became kind of like father and son today.
No, we did not.
Troy, I am telling you, man, this salmon is really good.
Would you mind passing me the pepper?
Oh, well.
More fish for Kunta.
{END OF EPISODE 16}{START OF EPISODE 17}
So I go into the bathroom with Tom, and we both, you know, take them out.
And I say, "Size more?
Try size less".
Ha-ha-ha.
Oh.
I wanna go to rehab and compare penises with people.
All in good time, kiddo.
Well, uh, Pierce, we're very glad to have you back.
I'm assuming.
Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
So, what should we do now?
I don't wanna be that guy, but I guess we should start studying anthropology.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Okay.
Um Chapter four.
- Hello.
- Oh, thank God.
Oh.
Yes.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
What is it, dean?
Oh, ha-ha, I have exciting news.
Vice president Joe Biden has been visiting community colleges across the country as part of his Biden Time Talking About Teaching tour.
Hmm.
Folksy, yet progressive.
It does walk that line.
Anyway, his tour is taking him in this neck of the woods and at 5:00 p.m. Today, he is stopping by Greendale.
Eat that, city college and wash it down with a nice tall glass of suck it.
The vice president is coming.
That explains the people covertly surveilling the campus.
Must be Secret Service.
Will your reality ever come out on Blu-ray so we can enjoy it?
We've been made.
Only problem, Mr. Biden is supposed to be meeting with the dean, hmm, and the head of our student government which doesn't exist.
So we have seven hours to elect a student president.
Ah.
What am I gonna wear?
I mean, I could borrow my sister's Uncle Sam outfit.
It's tailored for ladies, but what else can I do on such short notice?
Well, you cannot dress up like Uncle Sam.
Or admit you don't have a sister.
We're electing a student president.
I wanna run.
I have so many ideas for improving the school.
Improving Greendale takes more than ideas, Annie.
It takes time, gasoline, matches.
Mm.
Nice.
Jeff, some of us care about more than just fixing our hair and sculpting our abs.
- Wow, you got me pegged.
- Democracy.
What a ruse.
There's no such thing as a system in which the masses Everyone wants you to shut up.
And yet I won't.
Case in point.
We tend to take democracy for granted in America.
We tend to take democracy for granted in America.
But the fact is, men have fought and died for the sacred right we exercise today.
So anyone who wants to be president, line up by the ice cream machine.
Your applause will determine who gets into the primaries.
And yes, this is a ladies' Uncle Sam outfit.
It's my sister's.
It was last minute.
I had no choice.
I wonder if that's the same sister that tweets me to ask if I think her brother's cute.
What happened to that pile of campaign fliers?
I hung them all up.
Real nice.
Is it too much to ask you to pitch in?
I'm sorry, Annie.
I'm not the worker bee type.
I'm more of a silverback gorilla with the claws of a lion, the teeth of a shark, and quiet dignity of a tortoise.
- All right, first up is this fella.
- Let's go, come on.
All right, tell everybody your name.
Garrett.
Okay, Garrett.
And why do you wanna be president?
I wanted ice cream, so I got in line Okay, okay.
He wanted ice cream.
So, what do we say, gang?
Does he make it to the next round?
By applause.
Oh, we've got our first nominee.
The bar has been set.
All right, stand to the side.
Stand to the side.
At least worker bees can set aside their egos and join together to support a larger cause.
Oh, right, because politics are all about larger causes.
Face it, Annie.
Politics are all about ego, popularity, and parlor tricks.
Don't kid a lawyer.
Well, if I see one, I won't.
Oh, it's a girl.
Look at this.
She's got a yellow shirt and a hat.
Who are you, sweetie?
Uh Vicki.
Who's up for some Vicki?
Abed Nadir, I'm Special Agent Robin Vohlers.
This is Special Agent Keenlan of the Secret Service.
Will you submit to a search of your belongings?
Sure.
How did you notice the campus was being observed?
I guess I noticed because I'm used to being the only observer.
Well, we're not used to being noticed.
That sounds a little sad.
He's clean.
Although I could issue a warning for this bootleg of The Last Airbender.
Where were you a week ago?
You can keep it.
Well, another one makes the cut.
Congratulations, Leonard.
- Pbbt!
- Oh, yes, wonderful.
Next up, Annie Edison.
My name is Annie Edison.
And if elected, I promise to make Greendale the signature community college of the entire western three quarters of the Greendale area.
Annie!
Oh!
Looks like you're in the running, Annie.
Looks like it is hard not to be.
Next up.
I'm sorry, I got the heat, I gotta go.
I believe that humankind need not be governed.
I don't care.
Well, it's good to know there's a floor on this thing.
So Thank you, Ms. Perry.
Okay.
Oh, Annie, I'm so proud of you.
Thanks.
People love you.
I believe this campus is a good place, filled with good people who just need someone to protect their interests.
- Jeff Winger.
- Oh.
My name is Jeff.
I'm no politician.
I'm just a fella.
I think that beer should be cold and boots should be dusty.
I think 9l11 was bad.
And freedom, well, I think that's just a little bit better.
Yeah.
Whoo!
Yeah.
- Countdown has begun.
- Tonight, one student will be president, while the rest will simply be.
For Greendale Campus TV, I'm Abed Nadir.
I'm Troy "Butt Soup" Barnes.
That's my name.
As we head into the first round, there are eight candidates.
Annie Edison.
- Smart, attractive, but easily vexed.
- Leonard Rodriguez.
Did he change his last name?
- He's trying to court the Hispanic vote.
- Alex "Star-Burns" Osbourne.
Creepy, seems Greek , possible drug dealer.
- Jeff Winger.
- Crowd favorite.
- They call him Hot Wings.
- Magnitude.
He's a one-man party.
Pierce Hawthorne.
The wizard of wet wipes.
- I live with that dude.
- He's got night terrors.
- Garrett.
- That guy's just a mess.
- It's like God spilled a person.
- And Vicki.
Yellow shirt, hat, girl.
You know, you gotta ask yourself right now, Abed, what's up with politics?
Yeah, yeah.
You're right, Troy.
I hear they're getting ready to start.
We'll turn it over to coverage of the debates.
Who's that?
Special Agent Vohlers.
United States Secret Service.
Do you just constantly have your own side adventures?
Yep.
Me too.
Knock it off.
You're not running sincerely.
You're not even interested in student government.
I know, and yet, the people love me.
It's almost as if politics were a huge joke.
Okay, look.
I'm sorry I asked you to hang my fliers, but I suggest you drop out right now, because not only will I beat you, I will make you cry.
Oh, I feel a slight ego blowing in from the east.
You're gonna feel my foot blowing in from the south.
Bring it on, Ponce de Leon.
I'm gonna, Greg Muldunna.
It's a real guy.
He owns a mattress store downtown.
You can look it up.
Hey, Vicki.
Psst.
Vicki, look at me.
Psst.
I'm going to crush you.
Pierce.
- Stop that.
- I'm gonna eat your brains, Vicki.
I'm gonna slurp them out of that melon you call a head.
A reminder to all candidates, your microphones are currently on.
Well, they better be, because I'm on fire up here.
You freak people out, you know that?
You look weird.
Because of your overbite.
Okay, let's just get started.
Welcome to the Greendale Community College presidential debate.
Candidates, if elected, what will you do?
Oh, Annie.
I'm running on a platform of school improvement.
If I'm elected, the black mold will be removed from the east stairwell.
The assailant known only as The Ass Crack Bandit will be brought to justice.
And I will balance the school's budget by eliminating administrative redundancies.
Okay.
I'm in the room.
Thank you, Ms. Edison.
Mr. Winger?
Well, that's an important question.
And it's important to students like Jeremy, who told me that he is majoring in astronomy and is supporting two children.
It's an important question to Maria, who's a beautiful Latina born in Nicaragua - working in the cafeteria.
- Yeah.
What will I do, dean?
Well, these people don't want me to say what I'll do.
They want me to do what I'll say.
Aw.
They love it when you shuffle the words around.
- Go, Jeff.
- Magnitude?
Pop, pop.
Oh, no.
Same question.
Same answer.
Pop.
Pop.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?
Okay.
Was there a specific reason you had to repeat the first grade?
I didn't know how to use scissors.
I sat in the middle of the seesaw.
I found the distinction between duck and goose arbitrary.
Couldn't you just pick the sixth kid every time?
That's what I Would have done.
I went with four.
Jeez, get a room, you two.
Pierce Hawthorne, your platform?
My platform will be one high enough to push Vicki off to her death.
- Ugh!
- Vicki?
It looks like Vicki is out of the race.
Well, then I am too.
I was only here to get back at her for not lending me a pencil.
Oh.
Wow.
Well Can we get back on track here?
I just wanna get the black mold out of the east stairwell.
I just want to clean up Greendale.
Are you saying Greendale is dirty?
Oh, boo.
- Boo.
- Well, of course it's dirty.
Everyone knows that.
I don't, Annie.
I think it's clean.
I think it's the cleanest school in the entire country.
You know it is.
Jeff Winger's got this thing in the bag.
Sure does.
Say what you will , but people just like the guy.
Read my lips.
No matter what you're told, we have to clean the mold.
No matter what you're told, we have to clean the mold.
That's right, people.
No matter what you're told, we have to clean the mold.
No matter what you're This is interesting, Annie Edison has reduced her platform to one issue and turned that issue into a sound bite.
And it rhymes.
People love it.
This election's become a race.
According to our polls, the campus is almost evenly divided.
Keep in mind the margin of error is about 98 percent.
Could be higher.
We don't even know how to do margins of error.
We're taking a break.
Stay tuned.
They have to.
It's closed-circuit television.
- Don't know what that means.
- And we're out.
Can I get an apple juice, please?
Freshly squeezed, or so help me God, Maurice.
Abed, those guys in the suits are trashing your dorm room real bad, bro.
What are you doing?
Random spot check.
Stay out of our way.
Nothing suspicious.
Glenn, bring the car around.
What are you looking for?
Fertilizer, car battery, PVC piping.
Anything suspicious.
Because you think I'm suspicious?
Or you wish I was suspicious so that you would have an excuse to see me.
This was a spot check.
Do you like me?
That's not really relevant.
That's close enough.
Are you sure?
You smell like nice soap.
I have to go.
I'm sorry you weren't a more obvious potential threat to the country.
People are pretty excited about this black mold issue.
For my closing statement, I'm thinking about smashing a watermelon.
Jeff, if I admit politics are stupid, will you stop making them stupid?
You're gonna split the vote and Star-Burns is gonna end up president.
I'm the only one who's trying to get something done.
And you deserve to be allowed to do it?
You're entitled to be president?
The gloves are coming off.
You understand me?
I have an audio-visual presentation.
Wow, I'm shaking.
You should be.
You should be.
All right, let us resume.
Star-Burns, we haven't heard from you on this black mold issue.
Yeah, I actually withdraw my candidacy.
I fear a political career will shine a negative light on my drug dealing.
- Thank you.
- Boo.
Dean, before this election stops being about the issues, I have a question for my opponents.
What's your favorite color?
Mine's a three-way tie.
Red, white and blue.
Magnitude, a response?
I think you know, dean.
Pop, pop.
I set him up.
I have an audio-visual presentation, dean.
Oh, that sounds interesting.
What's your presentation?
My presentation is a copy of Jeff Winger's for MTV's The Real World.
What?
What?
Let's just roll it.
Thanks.
Hey, I'm Jeff Winger and I'd love to be on MTV's Real World: Seattle.
So check this out.
# Well, I guess it would be nice If I could be on MTV # # So please, please take a look at me For The Real World # # Oh, I'm gonna apply twice # Where did you get that?
Folks, who do you want shaking Joe Biden's hand at 5 p. M?
Me or?
Shut up.
I was like 19.
We've all been 19, Jeff, and none of us did this.
None of us.
Pop, pop.
I hate you.
I hate this school.
And I hope you all get black mold poisoning.
- Oh, Jeffrey, no.
- I hate you!
I hate you!
No, Jeffrey, no.
# You gotta have Jeff, Jeff, Jeff ## Are you in here?
Yeah, to be alone.
I've already established the men's room doesn't work.
You have an apartment.
There are people in the parking lot singing that song.
I went too far.
I'm sorry.
I didn't know it would be that bad.
You knew.
You didn't care.
But don't apologize.
I got what I deserved.
I am a gross, jaded adult with control issues that couldn't let a young, bright, idealistic kid run for president.
Wait, isn't there a final round of debates?
Yeah.
L You guys.
You're missing it.
Troy, I'm out.
Me too.
I withdrew my candidacy.
Nobody that treats a friend the way I did is fit to represent the student body.
Yeah, I know you're both out.
I'm saying you're missing it.
It's the political showdown of the century.
Come on.
Pop.
Pop.
Pbbt!
Pop.
Pop.
- Pbbt!
Pbbt!
- Pop.
Pop.
Pop.
Pop.
You should have stayed in the running.
You're the only real candidate.
No, I was just another jerk trying to win a contest.
You were right the whole time.
I just couldn't admit it until I saw you running away crying.
Yay.
I care what you think about me, you know?
Yeah, well, I care what you think about me.
That's why this happened.
Okay, well Resolved, then.
Resolved.
When we seek to destroy others, we often hurt ourself, because it is the self that wants to be destroyed.
Pierce, you're not usually so poignant.
Well, Vicki finally lent me her pencil.
Oh, my God, Pierce.
Go to the health center.
Yeah.
We've reached the end of election road.
Arguments have been made, pops have been popped.
Hearts have been stirred, perhaps broken.
The only thing that remains is to tally the vote in this matchup between the youthful, charismatic Magnitude and Leonard Rodriguez.
Two men fighting for the same piece of earth.
One recently born, one soon to die.
A competition reflecting the pointlessness of life.
Pull up, Abed.
You're in a nose dive.
I'm told that Dean Pelton is prepared to announce a winner.
We take you live to across the room.
Okay.
Here we go.
Thank you, Sergio.
With 11 votes cast Eleven, come on, people.
The landslide winner of the student election with seven votes is South Park.
Okay.
You know what?
I recall this is why we abolished student government in the first place.
This is exactly what happened 10 years ago.
Hey, how hard is it to get rid of black mold?
What do we need, buckets and sponges?
I don't actually know.
I'll look it up.
Milady.
Well, there you have it.
In a shocking write-in upset, Comedy Central series South Park has been elected president of the Greendale student body.
Not that shocking to me, I voted for it.
For real?
Me too.
We can never stop being friends.
As we begin gearing up for next year's election, for GC TV, I'm Abed Nadir saying: Did you know you could make napalm out of dish soap and cat food?
What?
Why would you say that?
Hmm?
Vohlers.
Yeah.
Sir, we're gonna have to move on to city college.
There's an elevated threat level at Greendale.
But don't worry.
I'll check it out.
Personally.
Whatever.
I just had a dream that I was a regular president.
You've done so much for our city.
Kickpuncher, is there anything that we can give you?
Don't call me Kickpuncher.
Call me David.
This was fun.
Maybe you can observe me having dinner next time.
Honk twice for yes, once for no.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
{END OF EPISODE 17}{START OF EPISODE 18}
Annie, two gifts?
Thank you.
I wanted to get a doll, and since the father might be Andre or Chang, I wanted all ethnic bases covered.
So there's a little African-American girl and a letter from the manufacturer promising to expand their selection.
Oh, is everyone enjoying their egg rolls andlor mieliepap, a traditional maize porridge popular in Ghana?
Annie, baby showers can be race neutral.
Yes, thank you for trying to be inclusive, but regardless of any biological happenstance, this baby'll be raised by Andre and I. That's right.
I seem to recall a story about a man named Joseph who raised a baby that wasn't his.
History's greatest chump.
We're talking about Joe Kennedy, right?
It's cool.
If it's mine, I'll be a lovable uncle.
Okay, a creepy uncle, final offer.
From me and Troy.
When your child's a scavenger of the nuclear wasteland, water will be worth gold.
We wanted to get a sawed-off shotgun, but those were pretty expensive already.
You people eat this?
I've never seen that in my life.
You really shouldn't say "you people".
Pierce was having trouble quitting offensive phrases.
We've created a bargaining system.
We traded "you people" for his other favorite phrases.
Yeah, I really got Jewish-personed out of that one.
- Here, open mine.
- Thank you.
A cigar cutter, Maxim and hot sauce.
It's a theme gift.
Yeah, the theme is "stuff lying around my apartment".
Sorry I'm late.
Can I get a ni hao up in this hizzy?
Why is everyone in this school obsessed with race?
- White people problems.
- Ooh.
That looks fun.
Oh, Troy, Abed.
Who's that cute guy that I saw you outside with earlier?
Lukka, our friend.
He's in Troy's class.
He's awesome.
He has an accent, rolls his cigarettes and plays the same video games as us.
We like him a lot.
So you're not allowed to bone him.
You just guaranteed she'll bone him.
Who am I kidding?
I should be putting this right on my thighs.
Abed, there's a guy on your 6.
I'm taking out my 9 mm.
Please.
In my country, we give 9 mm to little girl for sweet 16.
Try grenade launcher.
Cool.
Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
Knock, knock.
Hey, I was just stopping by.
- Oh, is this a bad time?
- Yeah.
Gentlemen, that's no way to treat a girl that looks this way.
Come in.
I'm Lukka.
Britta.
Like Britney Spears?
Exactly like Britney Spears.
# Hit me with your genie's bottle Rub it all over me ## Britta was just leaving.
No.
Stay.
Visit with your friends.
I must go anyway.
Ohh.
I'm cooking podvarak.
I never had that.
- I could make for you.
- Ohh.
- Okay, I'll give you my number.
- Oh!
- You are her boyfriends?
- No!
I love these guys.
They make funny with their mouths.
Here you go.
- I leave.
- Okay.
What?
He asked me out.
- Not allowed.
- Not allowed?
You'll ruin him.
Ruin him?
Stop repeating.
Stop re Remanding me.
Explain why I'll ruin him.
You date guys that we think are cool, and when you don't like them, you tell us horrible things about them.
Name one guy.
Carl, Todd, Kyle, Richard.
Jeff.
Fred.
Tall Kyle.
Jeff.
Jeff?
I ruined Jeff?
Jeff "Nipple Play" Winger?
No, we're still hanging out with him.
How's it going, Jeff?
Promise you won't date Lukka, I'll give you a sweatshirt I made for paintball.
Pssh!
You should've given me one a long time ago.
I kicked your asses.
Don't date Lukka.
Hit my genie bottle?
What the?
What was that?
Oh, oh.
Jeff?
I'm hoping you can help me with something.
Sure, let's have a look here.
Pieces of paper stapled together, a lot of writing.
This is as far as I can go.
I don't want you to read it.
Help me get Chang to sign it.
It's a little something I had an attorney draw up.
This is a forfeiture of parental rights.
Mm-hm.
Better safe than sorry.
Why do you need me to make Chang sign away his baby?
Isn't he living with you?
Not cool.
You have a rapport with him.
Not cool.
Besides, as your friend, can I tell you?
Don't poke that bear.
I think, right now, you're as protected as you can get.
I don't see Chang as being a real hands-on baby-daddy.
Oh.
Now we're in the business of knowing what's going on in Chang's head, huh?
Huh?
Fine, for the child.
God bless you.
Not lately.
I'm, um I'm so sorry, but could you just not tell Troy and Abed that we went out tonight?
No problem.
It's just Um, they're just really worried if you and I, you know, see each other, it's gonna affect your friendship with them.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
I can keep a secret.
Oh, good.
I'm from the Balkans.
There are many things I try not to talk about.
Oh.
Lukka, I knew it.
I knew there was pain in there.
Just so you know, you can talk to me about anything.
So much killing.
The corpses stacked like firewood.
The rivers red with their blood.
I miss it so much.
Lukka.
Mm.
Wait, just, um Just to clarify.
When you say you miss it, it's like you have survivor's guilt.
You wish you were back over there, defending the motherland?
Yes, I miss cleansing our fields and forests of the unclean people who stole my country.
I miss the smell of the villages burning.
Heh.
I miss the way they used to run from our tanks in fear.
Damn it.
My neighbor is jazz musician.
Hey, Spencer.
Come on, man.
I have woman in here.
Great.
He really knows how to kill the mood.
What are you doing?
Did you look for a job?
I was going to, but I noticed your coffee table was wobbly, so I decided to fix it.
Agh!
Must be the floor.
Don't saw the floor.
Don't saw anything.
I'm tired of confiscating saws.
Give me that.
Take this.
Parental rights?
You're adopting me?
It's from Shirley.
It gives her and Andre the baby.
Sign it.
Oh, and if anyone asks, this was my most convincing speech ever.
Why are you crying?
Ugh.
Don't tell me you wanted to be a father.
I don't know.
Maybe.
I mean, what if this is my last chance?
Between you and me, I don't Chang a lot of chicks.
But fathers are responsible.
They have jobs.
You crash on people's couches and twitch in your sleep like a dog dreaming of a rabbit.
It's real.
You don't Wait.
So you're saying if I get a job and my own apartment, Shirley might let me be part of my baby's life?
Yes.
That's exactly what I'm saying.
So does that mean I can?
Go for it.
Where do you keep getting these?
Hey, guys.
Where are you going?
Grabbing lunch for a video-game session with Lukka.
Fork foods.
Don't wanna grease up the troops.
Speaking of Lukka, how much do you know about him?
Why?
You start dating him?
You wanna tell us horrible things?
- What?
No.
- Good.
Lukka's gonna teach us how to break the will of an entire village.
That sounds horrific.
Ugh.
Girls are so undesensitized.
Jeffrey.
Hey, guys.
Hi.
So how'd the talk go with Chang?
About that.
I gave my most convincing speech ever and it didn't take.
Didn't take?
We're not giving him a perm, we just need him to sign.
"Need" is a strong word.
I think Shirley would feel comfortable if we had something in writing.
However, I believe that we can handle whatever obstacle comes our way.
Aww.
Baby.
Well, good morning, everybody.
Did you see the stock market today?
Up, down, pick a direction.
Huh?
I don't know about you, but I've been circling these want ads all morning.
Now, who wants to take a break and build a birdhouse?
Chang, what's going on?
Just getting my act together.
I got a baby coming.
I can almost hear the pitter-patter of Chinese feet across the treetops.
And when that happens, I gotta be the best dad I can be.
Right, Jeff?
Huh?
Come on, don't leave me hanging, my main mentor.
Oh, hey, is that a reason to leave?
Hm?
Jeffrey.
Excuse me.
Jeffrey.
- Excuse me.
- Let me ask you a question.
Why do I have to put the VCR on three if Bones is on five?
Jeff.
Jeffrey.
I know you're not gonna make a pregnant woman run.
I know you're not gonna make a pregnant woman walk this distance between us.
So I ask you to help me, and you take that as an opportunity to get Chang out?
Hey, who am I to stand in the way of someone?
Am I daytime television?
Very cute.
How cute's it gonna be when that lunatic is dangling my baby over a lion cage on alternate weekends?
Pretty cute.
Are they baby lions?
New low, Jeff.
Even for you.
Shirley Mm!
Right.
I'm not gonna make a pregnant woman storm off.
Mm-mm.
Look at them run.
They must die like the maggots that they are.
I didn't know we got points for killing villagers.
He's amazing.
And I thought I knew everything about this game.
Britta.
Hi, Lukka.
No!
Unbelievable.
Guys, calm down.
I'm just here for my "Trekkies do it in the final frontier" hat.
That's my hat.
Really?
Are you sure?
Yep.
Hey, Lukka, you are really good at this game, and there must be a reason that you are so good at this game.
Though your flirtation technique is hilarious, it's distracting.
Lukka is kicking serious ass right now.
He just set fire to a farmers' market.
Bang, bang, you're dead!
Ha-ha-ha.
Save your tears for your dog mother in hell.
Okay, fine.
Wait a minute.
You have DVD Blu-ray disc, Kickpuncher 3: The Final Kickening?
You let me borrow, no?
Sorry.
Thanks to Pierce, who kept writing "this side up" on my discs, I have a strict no-lending policy on my DVDs.
What would happen if somebody broke that rule?
They'd be dead to me forever.
Maybe we watch Kickpuncher 3: The Final Kickening together.
Yes, Lukka, maybe we do.
Maybe we do.
Would you please leave?
I don't want wanna play anymore.
I feel sick.
She's strange.
Can I talk to you for a second?
Can't talk till I see my face in this.
Well, can I give you some advice, dad-to-dad?
Hold on, hold on.
Where's my pipe?
Okay.
What's on your mind, neighbor?
Look, it's great you're trying to get your life together, but for your sake and for Shirley's, you need to relax a little.
Oh, I see what's going on.
Yeah?
You're scared.
No.
Feel me coming up on your tail, huh?
No, no.
Man, listen.
I've been a father for 11 years and a good one for nine of those.
I'm there when they're sick, pick them up from school.
Help them with their homework.
It's not how you act, it's what you do.
Well, I do.
You think that pool table put aluminum siding on itself?
Yeah, see, that's not what I'm talking about.
That's too bad.
What did that?
I'll go ahead and consider that point missed.
I got your text.
What's going on?
Something happened.
My Kickpuncher 3: The Final Kickening DVD is missing.
That's awful.
Somebody took it?
Who would?
Wait, Kickmuncher 3?
Wasn't that the movie that Lukka was?
You don't think?
Unless You don't suppose However No.
That would mean that you guys would have to stop hanging out No!
We have video of you taking the DVD.
What?
- Watch, I got this guy - Lookit.
Lookit.
One more, brother, you get Yeah.
You have a security camera?
It's for a documentary I'm making.
It's footage of me watching dailies, but it comes in handy.
I don't understand why you would pin it on Lukka.
Now you're just ruining cool guys for fun.
It's just cruelty, Britta, you're inhuman.
You're an inhuman person.
A monster.
Lukka's a monster for realsies.
I did this so you'd stop hanging out.
He's a war criminal.
You're embarrassing yourself.
In what war is he a criminal?
The battle for our affections?
Uh, how about the genocide in the Balkans?
Mm, yeah.
You would say that.
You just got caught red-handed borrowing a DVD without permission.
You guys have to believe me.
He's so much worse than Tall Kyle.
Hey, jefe.
What are you doing?
Who are these tiny people?
I picked up Shirley's kids, and I'm helping out with their homework.
Hey, kids.
Hey.
Hey, watch the cardigan.
What?
Why?
To prove I'm a responsible dad.
This proves you're a kidnapper.
I am nuts!
Get with the program!
What have I done?
I can't believe I said you could be a father.
I can be.
You can't be anything, you never will.
I pretended to have faith in you to get you out of my apartment.
Now, call Shirley and beg forgiveness.
Kids, why don't you get your stuff together?
I'll take you home.
Who's Shirley?
Shirley's your mom, dumb-ass.
Our mom's name is Loquanda.
Hey, hey.
That's racist.
Wait, is your mom's name really Loquanda?
Yeah.
You said you're a friend of hers.
Why didn't you know that, dumb-ass?
I do.
I was just playing an educational game with you.
Right.
Don't give me that lip.
Kids, you mind waiting in the hallway?
Yeah, no problem.
Go ahead.
I want you to understand something.
Yes.
You are a horrible human being.
I will never feel sorry for you again.
I don't care what happens to you, and when I get back, I want you gone.
Believe me.
I will definitely be far, far away from here.
Hi, policemen.
How much do you pay for anonymous tips about kidnappings?
Okay, fine.
This one's on me.
You're free to go.
Here's your wallet, keys and pasties.
They're nipple guards for running.
Olympic athletes use them.
I worked at a maximum-security prison, those are the gayest things I've seen.
Well, I find that hard to believe.
Jeffrey, I spoke to the boys' mother, she's not gonna press charges.
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm fine.
I spent the night learning arts and crafts from my cellmate, Chabo.
Did you know you can make an ashtray using a snitch's forehead?
Yeah.
Look, Shirley, I'm sorry I tried to capitalize on your situation with Chang.
Apology accepted.
Punishment is time served.
There's no cell that can hold Chang.
Cut it out, get down the hallway.
Come on.
Winger.
Thank God you're all right.
I've been looking all over Hey, Tracy, what's up, baby?
Why are they arresting Chang?
Loquanda wasn't pressing charges.
I talked her into going after Chang for child endangerment.
He could get three to five years.
You sure that's what you want?
Because if we put our heads together, we could be rid of him for 20 to life.
Really?
Oh, absolutely.
I'd testify that he tried to sell those kids to me.
Throw in that he was teaching them Spanish, any DA worth his salt could make a case for trafficking.
I like how you're thinking.
What is wrong with you two?
Why are you doing this?
I'm doing this for us.
We have a second chance.
I want everything to be perfect.
That's what you wanted the first time around.
You did everything to make everything perfect, and look what happened.
You cheated because I wanted what was best for our family?
No.
I cheated because I was a coward.
You took me back because while I was gone you learned to accept the bad with the good.
Oh, that's the Greendale effect.
Our school motto is "lower your standards".
Look, I know you are ashamed about what happened with Chang.
Hell, I am too.
But locking that little man up is not gonna make our lives any less crazy.
It will only make prison crazier.
I guess you're right.
It's impossible to keep the chaos from your lives.
We learned that in that movie we saw with all those dinosaurs.
Jurassic Park?
No, It's Complicated.
Okay, okay.
Time out, okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry to you, you, Officer Baby.
- Let's go, buddy.
- No!
Come on, you're coming with me.
No!
No!
Britta?
What?
You guys want me to ruin something for you?
Come on, you're being dramatic.
We asked Lukka a few questions after what you said.
He told us about his time in the army and the things he did I'm never gonna get those images out of my head.
If I go to Balkans, I'm bringing some serious cheat codes.
Why didn't you tell us sooner?
I didn't wanna be the one to ruin another guy for you guys.
There's a difference between telling us a guy likes nipple play and telling us a guy makes hats out of babies.
The reason this happened is because we've been riding you hard lately.
How about we promise to go easier on you, if you promise not to tell us about guys you're dating unless they've committed genocide?
Or if they're left-handed.
I wanna know.
I'm making a chart.
Deal.
I guess I ruined game night.
I tend to ruin stuff.
Come on.
You do not.
Wanna watch Catfish?
That movie where the guy flirts with the girl online, but it turns out that it's a fat, old woman?
Oh.
Sorry.
It's cool.
Maybe it's about catfish.
Well, this was fun.
{END OF EPISODE 18}{START OF EPISODE 19}
It was my friend Abed's birthday.
I had met Abed at community college two years earlier.
His obsession with pop culture had always alienated him.
He'd quote movies, pretend life was a TV show.
Watched Cougar Town.
As if he didn't want people to like him.
Then this year, around Christmas, he had some kind of, I don't know, mental episode, saying people were made of clay, stuff like that.
He seemed okay since, but when I asked if he'd like anything for his birthday, he told me we should have dinner, he and I, for an important conversation.
It made me nervous.
The restaurant wasn't his style at all.
There were cloth napkins, no TVs.
Abed liked chicken fingers, video games, Quentin Tarantino.
Babysitting him through a full meal at a restaurant for grown-ups?
I just wasn't up for it.
But I loved Abed.
Everyone did.
So I had come there with a plan of my own.
Hey, uh, could I get a Macallan, neat?
Jeffrey.
Buddy.
I like your sweater.
Did it come with a golden retriever?
Heh-heh-heh.
You look good too.
I would like a, um, spritzer if possible.
Abed was being weird.
And by that, I mean he wasn't being weird.
He was hugging, smiling, making eye contact, and in 30 seconds, he hadn't made a reference to anything.
I had come in worried about him, thinking he needed help.
But seeing him like this made me more worried than ever.
Get it?
Like Pulp Fiction.
A wallet that says "bad mother" Table's ready.
Actually, I had an idea.
I saw a very cool burger place just a few Nonsense.
I didn't come downtown for burgers.
Come, come.
Uh, I'll be right there.
Hey, we're running a bit late.
No big deal, just a small speed bump.
Well, hurry up.
We're waiting.
Surprise!
Guys, no.
- They're running late.
- Aw.
Jeff says there's some kind of speed bump.
Pierce, nobody can hear you.
Well, I'm hot, and my balls are touching a zipper.
Can you imagine the expression on Abed's face when he walks in?
- Of course I can imagine it.
- It's always the same.
But he's gonna say "cool" at least five times.
It's great of Jeff to put this together.
I'm not jealous.
Hmm?
Hmm?
Oh, cool, someone got him a briefcase, like in the movie.
What's in it?
Hey, don't touch that.
It's from Jeff.
He says nobody but Abed can open it.
Why?
What's in it?
What, I have 3D vision now?
Yes, you do.
You don't know me.
Everybody be patient and don't mess with anything.
I'm responsible for this diner when my boss isn't around.
She will not stop bragging about that.
I know.
- Has anyone seen this film?
- Am I the hero or love interest?
Pulp Fiction?
Saw it on an airplane.
Cute.
Film about a group of friends who like cheeseburgers, dancing and the Bible.
Jeff's not better than me.
Hmm?
I said, "Hmm".
Boy, is this menu stuffy.
I don't know about you, but I'd rather have a nice Rillettes de Saumon, to start, I think, and, oh, the squab.
Very good.
They don't have quail.
Good to know.
Salad.
- Excellent choice.
- Yeah, I nailed it.
Um, you forgot this in the bar.
Ah, so I did.
I'm sorry.
What a thoughtful gift, Jeff.
I really was a man of singular taste.
Was?
Abed, what's going on?
Why are you dressed like Mr. Rogers, talking like Frasier?
Oh, where to begin?
I mentioned my fondness for a program called Cougar Town.
Here and there.
I even started a fan club on Facebook.
Not to accomplish anything.
Simply to express my love for the show.
It ended up being quite large, this fan club.
And one morning, I think maybe early March, I got this Facebook message.
A very nice message from the people who make Cougar Town.
Looking for work?
Heh.
No, thanking me for support I generated for the show.
And in the last paragraph, they said, "You could come visit the set".
Just like that.
Well, that's cool of them.
I guess that kind of makes them the Pulp Fictions of people.
How great was that movie?
So I sold my action figures and bought a ticket to Los Angeles.
Wait, you went?
When?
Over spring break.
What could I do?
Two days after I got that invitation, I was on the set.
Cougar Town.
Want me to take it seriously, stop saying its name.
You laugh, Jeff, but the people were wonderful, not just the actors, but the crew.
Everyone.
There must have been 200 people, each with a specific function, but all dedicated to a single purpose.
It was like a village or a living thing.
I'm talking to the director and he says, "Jump into the background".
I say, "Jump into the background of what exactly"?
He says, "Background of this scene.
Walk through it.
Walk through Cougar Town".
Thank you.
Well, before I can react, this girl stands me behind this patio where the actors are doing their scene.
The girl says, "When you hear 'action, ' walk from here to there".
I really started to panic, because if I'm a person that watches Cougar Town, how can I be in Cougar Town?
The more I start thinking about it, the less any of it makes sense.
I wanna run, but too late, the director's calling "action".
So before I take my first step, I realize that I have to stop being someone who's seen the show and become a character on the show.
Become a man from Cougar Town.
You know, someone born there, someone whose name is Chad.
I take my first step, as a child, learning to walk as Chad.
With each step, it becomes easier.
I start remembering things from Chad's life, like his first kiss under the big tree at Cougar Town field, playing soccer at Cougar Town Junior High, finding my first chest hair in the shower, my first apartment, my first true love falling for my best friend, birthdays, weddings, car crashes, taxes, playing charades at Thanksgiving.
Chad had lived, Jeff.
You know, Chad had lived more than Abed.
And then they called "cut" and the scene was over.
But I wasn't ready to stop being Chad, so I said to the director, "One more take"?
But they were already moving on.
Courteney had nailed it.
My lips started trembling and my hands and my feet went numb, my knees buckled, and as I fell to the floor I pooped my pants.
I did.
Because the truth is, Jeff, I had been Chad, and Chad was dead.
But as Abed, I was still alive, so someone helped me up.
Wardrobe lady came.
She gave me new pants.
I thanked everyone, I apologized, and then I got on a bus and went straight to the airport.
Um Your food's getting cold.
Oh.
How silly of me.
Hmm.
Wondering if Abed's new best friend also got him the best gift?
I got Abed the best gift.
I'd tell you what it is, but it's an even cooler secret.
Britta, you promised that this private party would be done by 8.
You're doing this during peak hours for nostalgic-themed diners.
Has that been researched?
It has.
Frightened by the evening news, many seek the comforting foods and music of a pre-racial America.
Sorry, Brian.
They're a little late.
I'll give you all of my tips from my next shift.
Oh, your tips.
All your tips?
Wait, wait, all of them?
Like, all the tips the customers leave for you?
Wow.
Is there any way we can spread that over two years so I don't get slammed on my taxes?
Oh, my goodness.
I know.
Everyone hates Britta.
Mm-hm.
You know the real point of that story.
I don't, but that's okay.
Chew.
The point is, I'd been a fool.
No.
Everybody poops their pants.
I was a fool long before that.
I look back and think, "Who was that?
Why did he care about things"?
Yeah.
Who needs Cougar Town?
Who needs any pop culture?
TV, movies, to hell with all of it.
You know what I was, Jeff?
I was that wallet.
On the surface, a reference to cinematic drivel, but on the inside, empty.
But you love Tarantino.
No, no, not anymore.
That's why I wanted to have dinner.
First birthday of my new life.
The wallet's cute, but I'd like to exchange it.
I'm not leaving here until you've given me my first real conversation.
Yay.
Mm.
Okay, you wanna have a real conversation?
Here's as real as I get under the circumstances.
It's nice you've learned to dial back your love of TV.
But I'd like you to have a milkshake with me.
But before you do, remember how much you enjoy Pulp Fiction.
Now, that's as far as I can go.
I'm really tilting the bean can here.
Pulp Fiction, milkshakes, bean cans?
Listen to how we talk.
We're like robots exchanging catchphrases and references.
Pointing that out counts as a real conversation?
Fake people are talking about how fake the world is right now.
So start our real conversation.
I don't believe there's such a thing.
Conversation was invented by humans to conceal reality.
We use it to sweet-talk our way around natural selection.
You know who has real conversations?
Ants.
They talk by vomiting chemicals into each others' mouths.
They get right down to brass tacks.
Bleh.
"Which way's the picnic"?
Bleh.
"That way".
Humans are more evolved.
We lie.
Not all the time.
That's a lie.
We don't lie when alone.
Biggest lie ever.
Nine out of 10 lies occur six inches from the bathroom mirror.
We do most of our lying alone.
How's it possible to lie alone?
You call a phone-sex line.
Lying to yourself.
That's just being honest with a stranger.
What if you're dishonest about why?
What if you're a good-Iooking guy and tells them he weighs 400 pounds just so he can hear a woman say she's attracted to him anyway?
I don't believe that happens.
Wrong.
That's me.
Did that last week.
What?
Why pay a woman to think you're fat?
Because I'm scared that if I were overweight that no one would like me.
God, that feels good to admit.
Abed, the point being The point being, you don't have to worry about being normal or real or whatever this is tonight.
The world is a sick place full of sick, sick people.
Can I tell you something I've never told anyone else?
Yes.
It's gotta be so cool, whatever he got him.
You know what I'm saying.
Winger's a man of means.
He's with your boy right now, having a fancy dinner.
Baby chickens, Diamond forks, brand-name sodas.
Then he's gonna bring him back here, give him whatever's in there, and that's that.
Troy who?
Open.
Open.
Is that what I think it is?
It is.
Certificate of authenticity.
He must've got it on eBay or something.
Jeff got Abed the actual briefcase from the movie Pulp Fiction.
- Eeh.
- What are you guys doing?
Chang made me.
He seduced me with his Chinese powers.
Why do you leave him alone with me?
I put my job on the line for this stupid party and the least you can do is not ruin it.
No!
No!
Huh?
Aw.
Aw.
Dude, I know I'm preaching to the choir, but you are a bad friend.
I'll kill you!
What?
And I said, "No, that's a girl's costume".
And my mom said, "Indian boys have long hair and braids too".
There was only 45 minutes left to trick-or-treat, so what could I do?
I put the damn thing on and I went door-to-door.
And everyone was going, "Oh, what a pretty little girl".
And by the third house, I stopped correcting them.
I mean, why draw attention to it?
And, honestly, once the shame and the fear wore off I was just glad they thought I was pretty.
God, this is incredible.
I mean, to be able to talk this openly.
I mean, why can't people be like this?
I mean, what's wrong with this world?
What do you want?
So this is what you're doing while we wait.
Go home, Pierce.
The party's canceled.
Pretty gay, man.
Pretty gay.
Why is Pierce dressed as the gimp from Pulp Fiction?
Ah, pfft.
The wallet, milkshakes.
Did you set up a surprise Pulp Fiction birthday party?
At the Greasy Fork, but it doesn't matter now.
What matters is this.
Talking.
It everything okay?
- Yes.
Just the check, please.
- Oh.
I'm sorry.
So you're ending early?
In My Dinner with Andre Check, check, check.
Bye.
Abed?
Mm-hm.
What's My Dinner with Andre?
It's just a movie about, uh, two guys talking at a restaurant.
So this wasn't a real conversation?
Another movie?
A movie about a real conversation.
Did you poop your pants on the set of Cougar Town?
That shouldn't matter.
This is why we don't hang out.
Thanks for getting me fired.
The party's over.
- Cool, cool, cool.
- Yeah, it is.
Do you guys know where Abed's really cool present is?
- Because I'm returning it.
- Um It's back at the diner.
It's fine.
It probably just needs some detailing.
Man, I really wish you two got along better.
Oh, no-no juice.
Oh, that's good no-no juice.
I'll give you $ 1200 for the damages if you promise to give Britta her job back.
Eight hundred and she stays fired.
Deal.
Annie told me about the briefcase.
Thank you.
What a waste.
Not really.
Buy it from Willy's Authentic Cinema Treasures on eBay?
Yep.
Yeah, Willy exaggerates.
I got Indiana Jones' real whip from him.
He moves 70 of those a year.
Good.
Thought I flushed money down the toilet.
Great to know the real Pulp Fiction briefcase is safe somewhere.
You're mad at me.
I spent a week planning a party to make you happy.
And then I bailed on the party just to make you happy.
While I was wasting time trying to make you happy, you were making yourself happy all over everyone else by doing yet another stupid movie spoof.
I prefer the term "homage".
It wasn't about making me happy.
My Dinner with Andre is about a guy who has an unexpectedly enjoyable evening with a weird friend he's been avoiding lately.
You think I've been avoiding you?
You and I hung out more last year.
It makes sense.
Everyone else is growing and changing all the time, that's not my jam.
I'm more fast-blinking, stoic, removed, uncomfortably self-aware type.
Like Data or Johnny 5 or Mork or HAL or K.I.T.T.
Or K9 or Woodstock andlor Snoopy.
Spock goes without saying.
I don't need you to grow or change.
Take it from someone who just had a meaningless one, sometimes emotional breakthroughs are overrated.
And, seriously, keep a tight, heavy lid on the little Indian girl story.
Sure.
Tight, heavy lid.
Cool.
THL.
Still friends?
Nobody paid for dinner at the restaurant, and I do not have this kind of money.
- I went back to pay the bill.
- The restaurant was closed.
Surprise!
Surprise.
It was Abed's idea.
The group had stayed behind to salvage the party.
The waiter felt bad for spilling the beans about Abed's homage, so he let us stay.
As parties go, it was quiet, dark and a little lame.
We'd had better parties and we'd had worse parties.
But I doubt I'll ever forget my Dinner with Andre dinner with Abed.
Thanks.
Abed, please, allow me.
Okay.
Thanks.
Let me see.
Mm.
That's not good.
They said "market price".
What market are you shopping at?
!
I'm going to run.
Me too.
Okay.
On three.
One.
Two.
Three.
{END OF EPISODE 19}{START OF EPISODE 20}
Don't forget, Greendale.
It's the last day to sign up for a spring semester elective.
Horseback riding, waterskiing, fencing.
Those are just a few classes we can afford to offer if enough people pay to learn hopscotch.
Oh, they've got a class on jokes.
Don't take that.
I dropped it after the lesson on setups.
The professor is so old So many classes.
I don't know what to choose.
I'll give you the advice my father gave me the night I lost my virginity.
"Just pick one.
They all cost the same".
You could always take "The Actor Inside" with me and Troy.
How'd you get dragged into that one?
Our dance teacher encourages us to take acting to tap into our emotions, so Troy and I both decided to take it together.
Hm.
Foosball was full?
On the wait list.
Don't give up.
I was on the wait list for this class for a year and I got in.
"Who Indeed: A Critical Analysis of Television's Who's the Boss"?
The professor is the author.
We got him?
I know.
So, what are you taking, Jeff?
While you are expanding your minds and souls, I'll be expanding my liver in Italian Wine Tasting.
I'm taking that one too.
How do you say "ha, ha" in Italian?
I'll look it up.
Come on, it'll be fun.
I can give you pointers.
I was a lawyer at a top-tier law firm.
When I wasn't shielding the wealthy, I was drinking their finest wines.
You have your own wine cellar?
Pierce does.
And it's "ha, ha".
Anyone can have a cellar.
It's what's in it.
Pierce's has a special gym with swings and saddles.
Uh, we don't We don't discuss the special gym.
Attention, please.
Attention, please.
All elective forms must be in by the end of the day.
Oh, nice job, Manuel.
And good news, there's still plenty of room in my PA Announcements class.
Just 10 bucks an hour.
You're taking this too?
Hell, yeah.
You got drunk ladies, fancy bathrooms and a room full of free coats.
Sorry I'm late, man.
I brought you a present.
Oh.
From before your chin dimple filled in.
Uh, excuse me.
So sorry.
Hm.
Whoa.
Who is the dumpling with the nice Asian pair?
That's the first time sexism made me hungry, but she is something.
I fear I may have to let her see me nude.
I might have to take a shot myself.
What's funny?
Why would a woman want a Plymouth on blocks when she could have a Testarossa with a six-speed stick?
Because my stick is ribbed for her pleasure.
I think those are wrinkles.
Let that breathe.
Lingering scent, full body, perfect nose.
Very nice wine.
I was talking about you.
Jeff Winger.
Wu Mei Hong Long.
Oh, what a lovely name for a lovely Uh Not interested.
Please take weird haircut, stupid grin, and go sniff another dog's ass.
Heh, heh.
The red dragon ordered a Number When you get up close, she's very homely.
This is gonna be fun.
I can't wait till we choose stage names.
Which do you think is better, Trevor St. McGoodbody or David?
Don't think you have to worry about that.
This is about introspection.
Drag.
Less of a drag.
Quiet!
Form a trust circle around me and sit on the floor.
- A trust circle?
- It's just a circle.
It's a circle.
Sit down.
Acting is revealing, expression.
When we release pain, we become visible to each other, and that is an actor's job.
That and, you know, pretending to be other people.
Let's start with you.
Access and share with us a profoundly deep and painful memory.
I'm on the playground.
Stop taunting me.
I just want to go on the swings!
Good.
Early childhood is a treasure trove of pain.
That happened this morning.
You're up.
Me?
Um I don't think I don't want you to think.
Feel.
Go back.
Dig in, emotilise.
Something hurt you.
Um I was captain of my high school football team.
It was very hard being popular.
- What a loser.
- Okay, great.
Next person.
I've always felt somehow ignored, almost invisible.
Every time I go to say something, somebody My uncle put his finger in my no-no.
What?
Oh, my God.
This.
This is where acting begins.
Welcome to A Critical Analysis of Who's the Boss?
I am Professor Peter Sheffield, and I'd like to begin with a simple question: Who was the boss?
Yes.
Angela.
Oh, well, class dismissed.
No, calm down.
Calm down.
I'm sorry, um, Mr?
Abed.
The answer is not quite that simple, Mr. Abed.
Few are.
Now, if everyone could please turn to Page 12 in my book.
Ahem, loser.
You have to finish that by tomorrow?
Yeah, but it's a page-turner.
I'm on the chapter where he traces Tony Micelli's genealogy to Caesar.
Better than wine tasting with Pierce.
Refused pinot noir, thought it was French for "black penis".
And he's late, again.
It's not your fault.
It's not your fault.
Thank you.
He'll be here.
He wouldn't miss a chance to say something offensive.
Man's gonna run out of ways to shock people.
Everybody, this is Wu Mei, and we're getting married.
But it's not gonna be today.
So you're getting married to that beautiful young thing?
Well, uh, stranger things have happened.
No.
No, they haven't.
You said you guys just met?
Yesterday after wine tasting class I mentioned that her breasts were larger than most Asian women, and we just got to talking.
Turns out Pierce has been to China many times.
To get fireworks too dangerous for Mexico.
No.
I go to visit my factory.
Hawthorne Wipes are the number-one towelette in Asia.
After a few minutes, we both just knew we were meant to be together forever.
Or at least until she gets heavy.
And now we must leave you.
Many plans to make.
Yes, yes, big plans.
Well, what are we gonna do?
Plan an engagement party.
You out of your mind?
This is a scam.
She's after his money or a green card.
They seem to like each other.
Pierce married three of his wives after knowing them a month.
Maybe he's just a romantic.
Not that you would understand romance.
Don't preach to me about romance.
I had a three-way in a hot air balloon.
Fine.
Guess I'll do it myself.
Ready to go?
Mm-hm.
Boy, he seems really worked up.
Hey, don't take on his pain.
Tend your own garden.
I'll see you in class.
What's going on?
Oh, um I didn't have a painful experience to share in acting class, so I said my uncle tried to touch my butt.
Britta's attracted to pain.
Helps her pretend to be healthy.
Really?
Yeah.
I hadn't noticed.
Troy?
Hm?
Nothing good can come of this.
Yeah.
I'll have to think hard about how to defuse the situation.
No, Uncle Lucius, I don't wanna play in the laundry room!
My emotions!
My emotions!
- That was really beautiful.
- Actors dismissed.
Uh, for homework, drink a glass of cognac in a bathtub.
Troy, I feel like I'm seeing a whole different side of you.
There's just so much darkness.
And my soul is darkening, and my heart is mad at my kidneys, and My mouth See you tomorrow.
Um, hello.
Oh, hi.
I'm glad you could come.
Please sit.
Okay.
I felt like we got off on the wrong foot, and I wanted to offer you my other foot.
First, let me say how happy I am for you both.
Your parents must be so excited.
Are they coming to the wedding?
Oh, they would not miss it.
My mother will make the customary shark's fin soup, and my father will get drunk and make bad impression of Borat.
Oh, so your parents don't mind having a son-in-law roughly their age?
No.
Pierce is a beautiful, wise man, very gentle soul.
Let me tell you that I am a lawyer, so if you need any help at all, navigating the whole green card, immigration hassle I am dual citizen already.
Oh.
If you'd like me to look at the prenup I assume you have one.
Yes, but my father's lawyers will take care of this.
After all, we must protect our family fortune.
Hm.
Now I'm stumped.
Excuse me?
Uh It was That means it was very nice talking to you.
Oh.
Okay, if you say so.
Okay.
Bye.
Okay, goodbye.
Why were you grilling her?
I'm gonna bust into her apartment.
Do you have any grappling hooks?
Maybe Pierce found his soul mate.
How can you say those things without irony?
That's why they call me irony-free Annie.
Mm, trust me, that's not what they call you.
Yes?
Oh.
Mr. Abed.
What can I do for you?
I finished your book, professor.
I've been watching Who's the Boss?
There's something you overlooked.
Mr. Abed, will you look at my wall?
Mm-hm.
What do you see?
Photographs.
Of what?
You.
With whom?
Tony Danza, Judith Light, Alyssa Milano, Who's the Boss caterer Gordon "Giddy-up" Galligan.
I have studied this show, Mr Abed.
I am not a fan, I am not a groupie, I am an academic.
When I ask the question, "Who's the boss"?
It is a rhetorical question.
When I ask the question beyond the question, "What is a boss"?
I really think it's Angela, because if it's a boss you're looking at Enough!
I would like you to leave.
My mind is open.
Open as the door to Mona's bedroom.
It's a shame yours isn't.
I beg your pardon?
You know, I just got a wonderful idea.
Why don't you teach the next class?
That way you can share your open mind with everybody.
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.
Pew!
I couldn't be more touched you threw us an engagement party.
You said if we didn't, you'd slash our tires.
Ha, ha, ha.
She is funny.
Like Oprah.
Oprah's not a comedienne.
No, you are funny, and you are like Oprah.
Heh, heh, heh.
Yeah.
What?
WU MEl: Thank you.
Pierce.
I'd like to offer sincere congratulations.
It's hard to find people you can stand, let alone someone willing to stomach your imminent dementia and present incontinence.
Thank you, Jeff.
I just hope she can satisfy me.
I'm like an insatiable baboon in the bedroom.
Don't sell yourself short.
You're a baboon everywhere.
Seems like just yesterday me and Abed dined and ditched here.
Here, hold this.
Bah.
What is this?
I carry spare apps in case the staff's racist.
Where's a napkin?
Here you go.
Oh, thanks.
Check that out.
Hats off to Pierce and the hot red dragon.
Why do you keep calling her that?
"Hong Long" means "red dragon".
That's her middle name.
In China, they put the last name first.
I mean, they're nuts over there.
Thank you all for coming.
I know it seems fast, but when you find the right person, you know.
I know because I've found the right person seven times.
So the drinks are on me, but stick to the crappy stuff.
I don't wanna get cornholed on the bar tab.
Pierce, you can't just throw around a term like that.
Cornhole.
Cornhole.
Cornhole.
Pierce, Troy was molested.
Cool.
Troy, we didn't know.
Troy, do you need me to recommend a support group?
Hey, he's not a victim.
You're a survivor.
Yeah, about that.
I wasn't so much "molested" as much as I "made it up".
What?
We're gonna laugh so hard about this later.
I'd like to propose a toast.
Wu Mei Hong Long, better known as Mei Hong Long Wu, is not only not a Greendale student, she works for Red Dragon Wipes, the number-two wipe in Asia, currently attempting a takeover of Hawthorne Wipes.
So please, raise your glasses, to saving Pierce from the clutches of a corporate spy.
And to me for being attractive enough to get a girl like her under normal circumstances.
Very impressive, Veronica Mars.
You learned how to use Google.
And you learned to fight your desire for me.
Oh, stick it.
You suck.
Wait, wait, wait.
Record scratch app.
Where'd everybody go?
Most people went home.
The rest went with Chang to have a ketchup fight.
I better get back there before he starts playing monkey drop.
Don't ask.
Oh, uh Do you wanna come?
Why would I wanna go anywhere with Judas Winger?
You're mad?
You should thank me.
For what?
Ruining my relationship?
What relationship?
You just met the woman, and the entire thing was a lie.
She was just using you to get your company.
And I was just using her to get her company in the sack.
People use each other, Jeff.
It doesn't mean that there aren't feelings that go with it.
I liked her.
She was busty.
I thought we had something.
I was trying to help you.
I think what you were trying to do is prove that no woman could want me.
You're here.
Look, Britta, I'm really sorry.
Troy, kissing you was a mistake.
It will never happen again.
Good.
Before my ex-boyfriend Pablo was arrested for forging church relics, he accused me of only being attracted to a certain kind of guy.
It was hard to understand him, though.
He was huffed up on paint thinners.
Well, maybe someday you'll fall for someone who's healthy.
Someone who, other than his irrational fear of automatic toilets, is normal.
Who would like to begin today?
I would.
With a confession.
My uncle never stuck his finger in my plop-plop.
I know, I'm bummed about it too.
I'm sorry.
I wanna be interesting.
I wanna fit in with you guys.
I wanna be able to be an actor.
The pain of not having enough pain is still pain, young man.
That may sound like an easy resolution, but we're not writers.
We're actors.
Story doesn't matter here.
All that matters is our time in the spotlight.
And so, by all known definitions of the word "boss," I.e., one with authority over another, in nine of 11 possible fields in which one might teach, employ, guide, oversee, andlor hold dominion, the empirically provable answer to the question "who's the boss"?
is Angela Bower.
Class dismissed.
Class dismissed!
There's a path you take and a path untaken.
The choice is up to you, my friend.
I wonder why Jeff and Abed didn't show.
I don't know about Abed, but I'm sure Jeff just found another life to destroy.
You thinking about studying acting?
I'm auditioning for Garrity's all-black production of Fiddler on the Roof.
It's called Fiddla Please.
What's she doing here?
I asked her to come.
I was thinking maybe you two were meant to be together.
You're both rude, deceitful and racist, and you both come from moist-wipe dynasties.
I think having that much in common justifies at least one real date.
I guess we could go out to dinner.
You're paying.
You're dressing slutty.
Fine.
How about Mexican?
How about Thai?
They're like Chinese Mexicans.
Heh.
So true.
Hm.

{END OF EPISODE 20}{START OF EPISODE 21}
I can't believe this is our 20th and final anthropology diorama of the year.
I can't believe our assignment is making a diorama of us making our 19th diorama.
That's kind of weird.
Oh, come on.
My forehead is not this big.
Troy, can you pass me that paintbrush?
My monkey!
My monkey took that paintbrush and went into that vent.
Oh, I miss him so much.
- Someone's got to go after him.
- I got this.
What are you doing?
Trust me.
I know these vents like the back of my Chang.
Holy That a new stereotype?
Oh, my God.
Did you find him?
Is that a new stereotype?
No, and no.
But there's all kinds of stuff in here.
Guys, you won't believe this.
Ooh.
It's like a sentimental treasure pile.
Oh, that's my spoon.
No!
Oh, Hubba Bubba.
Cool.
I thought they stopped making this.
And that's all of it.
Good.
That means you can put your clothes back on.
Uh-uh.
I'm going back in.
- Why?
Monkey took my spoon.
- It's like a reverse cow birth.
- Annie, look!
All of your purple pens are here.
Do you remember when you got so mad because you thought someone was stealing them?
There are so many memories in this pile.
Look.
Whoa.
The deputy's badge from when we spent that day in that old ghost town.
Oh, yeah.
We have to find the saloon.
Every building is a saloon.
We gotta go!
Get the tarnation back here, you city-slicking sons of Aah!
Eh.
Mm-mm.
That was one of the best days of the year.
I almost forgot about it.
We almost got shot.
Yeah, but by a prospector in red long underwear.
How cool was that?
Glad you had fun.
By the way, that dude was hard-core racist, like 1800s Disney-style.
We learned new ways to hate ourselves.
Hey, glee club trophy.
You guys remember when we had to fill in for glee club?
Guys, that's not a fond memory.
We won, like, 70 awards.
Yeah, but the reason we had to fill in for glee club was because they died.
Their bus crashed.
I know, but I was remembering around that part.
Yeah, focus on the positives, like we got that cool new bus driver.
Nice try, Britta, but it's been a dark year.
Pierce got hooked on painkillers.
Shirley's having an unplanned baby.
Apparently, Chang is in the group?
It's true.
God hates us.
Remember when Abed had a total mental breakdown at Christmas?
That was adorable and magical.
He thought everything was claymation.
- Heh, heh.
- Yeah.
But everything wasn't.
And what do you see now, Abed?
A candy cane forest.
We're all running through the candy cane forest.
Oh, careful, don't trip on a gumdrop.
Oh, no, I tripped!
On a gumdrop!
Yay.
Let's find Santa some more.
Well, I think this year was awesome.
Full of good times with great people.
Come on, you guys.
Stop focusing on all the bad stuff and dig deep.
Abed, you're a computer.
Scan your mainframe for some juicy memories.
- Jeff and Britta are having secret sex.
- Oh!
Uh Exhibit A, the one thing I do remember from Halloween.
Hi.
Hi.
You need some help in there?
Yeah, well, I can't use my hands in this costume, so - Well, uh - Exhibit B. Something I overheard during Christmas.
Why would I want to be in a school that hates Christmas?
He's got a point.
Kidding.
What are you doing later?
How about some holiday benefits?
Hey.
Lxnay in front of Uncan-day.
Hm.
Finally, exhibit C, the curious circumstances following the exciting conclusion of our St. Patrick's Day adventure.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Oh!
Abed!
Uh Uh, uh A leprechaun took our clothes.
And you can never tell anyone, okay?
Okay, so we hooked up a few times, but there's a much larger issue here.
We are friends with a grown man that clearly believes in leprechauns.
Didn't we decide at the beginning that for the good of the group we wouldn't allow any intimacy between each other or ourselves?
Troy, we never said ourselves.
- Okay, now I'm really mad.
- So am I. Now we know why our year's been so horrible.
It's not God that hates us.
It's Jeff and Britta.
Oh, please.
If we were ruining your year, why didn't you know about it?
Maybe we were so distracted by all the other times you put yourselves before the group.
What?
When have we ever put ourselves before the group?
You want examples?
I think they want some examples.
Okay, let's give them some examples.
Troy, drop a beat.
Just give them some examples.
Fine.
Chipmunk.
Mm.
Impressive, Mr. Winger.
Someone's going to regionals.
- It's a special cape.
- A cape for justice.
- What are you doing?
- There's rioting in Tunisia!
The Cape is premiering.
Humanity is premiering, you jags.
We need to talk.
These people are giving out free iPhones!
- What?
- No, no.
No!
This habitat was for humanity.
Whoever did it, step forward.
You five are in big trouble.
Jeff and Britta, you're free to go.
Because you didn't step forward, and are therefore innocent.
You can't ignore the facts.
You two are ruining this group.
Just because we're good-Iooking doesn't make us villains.
Are you sure you guys have the group's best interests at heart?
Feast your ear tongues on these memory pops.
Pierce, you've had three flu shots.
That's for the day-care center.
I'll be a living god!
I'm glad you're considering the exciting opportunity of selling Lady Miss Lady cosmetics.
Please, open your starter kits.
Okay, now that the seals have been broken, you each owe me $50.
I'm Jeff Winger.
Does this hard-boiled egg make me look fat?
- My name is Jeff Winger.
- I love working this BlackBerry because it tones my thumbs.
Heh, heh, heh.
It was a particularly small egg.
That's why I was asking.
You can yell at me all you want.
I've seen enough movies to know that popping the back of a raft makes it go faster.
Show's gonna last three weeks!
Six seasons and a movie!
Pierce, you can't sneak up on me like that.
When I'm startled, my training takes over.
Hello!
Those are just stories about us being cute.
You guys go out of your way to endanger the fabric of the group.
Yeah, leave our fabric alone.
You guys aren't seeing the bigger picture.
We compartmentalized our libidos for the good of the group.
Oh, you compartmentalized, did you?
Then what's been going on with us all year?
What are you talking about?
I'm talking about the Annie of it all.
The long looks, the stolen glances.
The general atmosphere of "Would they, might they"?
Annie, I think you're reading into some things.
Oh, really?
Oh, give me a break.
I mean, you could do the same thing with Pierce and Abed.
Let's be honest, there's more between you and Annie than between me and Pierce.
How dare you?
Abed, it's called chemistry.
I have it with everybody.
Everybody?
I haven't felt any of that chemistry coming my way.
I don't know if you're racist or I intimidate you sexually, but it's one of those.
Dean-a-ling-a-ling.
I was just heading to judge our belated carnival when I heard you guys having a tiff.
What's the rumpus?
We were debating how many times per year a man can drop in a study room in a dumb costume with irrelevant news.
Dean-yow!
It's Feline Aids Awareness day, folks, so let's whip it in the keister.
Guys, Greendale's music department is flat "baroque," so we are having a fund-raiser.
What's dean got to do with it?
Heh, heh, heh.
Why, it's time to Tina "Turner" the clocks ahead.
Happy daylight savings!
Deanie, vidi, vici!
I came, I saw, I conquered the idea of a free Caesar-salad bar in the cafeteria.
Frankly, my dear, I don't give a dean.
Heh, heh.
That's right, Greendale presents "Gone With the Windows," where we'll celebrate our new energy-conscious windows with a cotillion.
Heh, heh, heh.
Oop.
Okay.
Well, I guess we don't see our patterns until they're all laid out in front of us.
Thank you for being so nice about it.
Oh, dean.
Dean.
Can we please stop fighting?
We're starting to hurt innocent perverts.
I don't want to stop.
We're airing out this dirty laundry.
After that, we'll stop fighting forever.
Am I the only one that remembers our horrible camping trip?
"Some-mores," not "s'mores".
No, you're saying it wrong.
- I just found out about it.
- It's pronounced "s'mores".
Yeah, it's a contraction of "some mores".
So contract it.
Stop saying "some-mores" unless you "can not".
Guys!
We need to stop fighting.
No, we don't.
It's good that we're getting all this out there.
After this, we'll stop fighting.
That's what we said when we were painting Shirley's nursery.
- I was talking about the paint.
- You were being racist.
When I'm being racist, you'll know.
Guys!
Let's not repeat events of Caesar Salad Day.
We need more people like Ralph Nader in this country!
He was promoting automotive safety!
Aah!
Troy, your nose is bleeding.
Abed, stop being meta.
Why do you always take whatever happens and shove it up its own ass?
He's not being meta.
He's pointing out what none of us acknowledge.
It's all of us.
This group is toxic.
We fight about fighting about fighting.
We're sick.
I hate us!
Well, what do we do now?
We could do what we always do.
Storm out in a huff and say that the group is breaking up.
Troy, pass me that paintbrush, please.
Aah!
Does anybody have any iodine?
How many vents are you gonna crawl out of this year?
That's it.
We're done.
Yeah.
Done.
See you all tomorrow.
You guys, wait.
I wanna say something.
You don't have to save us with a speech.
We're not breaking up.
So we don't need to get back together.
I know I don't have to, but I want to.
Look, we've known each other for almost two years now.
And, yeah, in that time, I've given a lot of speeches, but they all have one thing in common.
They're all different.
These drug runners aren't gonna execute Pierce because he's racist.
It's a locomotive that runs on us.
And the only sharks in that water Are the emotional ghosts that I like to call fear.
Anchovies.
Fear.
And the dangers of ingesting mercury.
Ah!
Because the real bugs aren't the ones in those beds.
And there's no such thing as a free Caesar salad.
And even if there were The Cape still might find a second life on cable.
And I'll tell you why.
The heart of the water is truth.
That water is a lie!
Harrison Ford is irradiating our testicles with microwave transmissions!
So maybe we are caught in an endless cycle of screw-ups and hurt feelings, but I choose to believe it's just the universe's way of molding us into some kind of super group.
- Like the Traveling Wilburys.
- Yes, Troy.
Like the Traveling Wilburys of pain, prepared for any insane adventure life throws our way.
I don't know about you, but I'm looking forward to every one of them.
- Oh, Jeffrey.
- Oh, Jeff.
Jeffrey, Jeffrey.
Well, I guess we can get through anything.
So it's probably okay if you and Britta want to keep, you know, hooking up.
- I don't mind it so much.
- I'm cool with it.
- God cares.
- Have fun tonight.
So guess we don't have to keep sneaking around anymore.
Yeah, I guess not.
Wanna stop doing this?
Yeah.
Wanna stop doing this?
Yeah.
It's not you, it's me.
It's you.
Hey, guys.
Hey, guys.
Hey, you guys remember the time when?
Those guys don't care who they hurt, do they?
You know, I still don't even know if I'm in the group.
Hey, you and I have had some pretty good times, huh?
Ow!
Ow!
Aah!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Aah!
What a year.
Ow!
Ow!
Aah!
Aah!
Ow!
Ow!
Hey, everybody.
Can I help you with anything?
I care about you guys.
Shut up, dean.
You dress in stupid outfits.
Well, you have a right to your opinion, so I'll just leave.
You could have been nicer to the dean, Jeff.
So what?
I don't care.
I just think there maybe could be repercussions, yo.
I don't care what you think.
I don't care about repercussions.
I don't care about the dean.
Okay.
Okay.
Meanwhile, at that same moment, a truck full of toxic waste crashes and spills on the dean, transforming him into Mega-Dean!
I don't care about anything.
Wait.
I care now!
Now I care!
Too late.
I owe you guys an apology.
The dean runs our school.
He's entitled to a modicum of respect.
You're always so mean to him.
Why?
It's embarrassing to admit, but sometimes I felt jealous of his interesting outfits.
Jeffrey, if I didn't know better, I'd say you had a crush on him.
I'll never tell!
{END OF EPISODE 21}{START OF EPISODE 22}
And that's how Paleolithic hunting tribes overtook early agricultural civilizations.
Oh.
That's an interesting answer, Miss Edison.
Is it right?
Don't know, don't care.
But so far, you're all getting A's.
- Yes!
- You're welcome.
Are you sure everyone should get A's?
It seems unfair to the people that actually studied.
Throw paper balls at her head until she sits down.
- Sitting.
I'm sitting.
- Good.
Very good.
A-pluses for all of you.
Professor Duncan, you are such a great teacher when you're drinking.
Thank you, Darrell.
It's Troy.
Hey, it the man wants to give Darrell an A, let him do it.
Nice shot.
Oh, thanks.
A toast to the easiest school, the dumbest dean And the ultimate blow-off class: Anthropology.
Who knew?
- Cheers.
- Yeah.
Hey, Shirley.
Hm?
You're not drinking.
Someone is cruising for an A-minus.
Oh, no, no, I'm with child.
If it's my child, it's okay to have a drink or two.
Chang babies love the sauce, you know?
Alcohol and duck.
Zoink.
This is not your child, Chang.
It's Andre's.
How do you know?
Because I don't see any locusts.
Besides, a woman knows these things.
Women have a connectedness to their bodies that you would never understand.
You have a booger.
I know, it's part of me.
Hey, can we please do the exam?
Question number two: How awesome is it that this class is fake?
Yeah.
Here is to never telling the dean.
- Yeah.
- Cheers.
Hi.
And that is what Jews do at weddings.
Anthropology.
Lehayim!
Professor Duncan, class, this is Mr. Jacobson.
He's a writer who's doing a piece on me for Dean Magazine.
Ah!
I know, right?
Keep taking your exam.
Don't let my presence distract you.
I'm sort of a father figure to the kids around here for my outside-the-box approach to education.
You know, like that film, Children of the Corn.
Uh, professor.
What?
Proceed.
Yes.
The anthropology final.
Do you know what?
I have left the exam paper in my office, but it is a real doozy.
There is an interactive element, a performance component, and I don't wanna tip it, but there may be a lump of clay coming to everyone in the room.
So toodle-Ioo.
Cheerio.
Wowee.
This is a real college.
So after this, we should check out the World Food Festival in the parking lot.
No way.
There are lunch trucks with 18 different nationalities of food.
You know what?
Not different, equal.
Equal to whites.
You know what?
Better than whites.
I think that sounds like an awesome thing to do immediately.
I bet the reader of Dean Magazine would love it.
- Yeah.
- Mm.
I'm good.
I'd like to stay here and check out this unorthodox exam.
Oh Shirley, you okay?
Uh-huh.
Just a little indigestion.
I've been having it all morning.
Are you sure it isn't a contraction?
- No, no.
- It's way too early for any of that.
My other two came right on schedule.
Maybe even a little late.
Jordan was in here so long, he came out with a driver's license.
I'm kidding.
That's not true.
Ooh.
Chang babies are always premature.
We gestate fast because we're better at obtaining nutrients.
Some need only eight months, depending on how much of the mother they eat.
Oh Uh Shirley, that is full of chemicals.
I wouldn't expose your baby to that.
Actually, my doctor said antacid is safe to take.
Let me guess who paid for that study: Big antacid?
Shirley, chew on a eucalyptus root and, I know it sounds gross, pig saliva.
It's the same active ingredient as antacid.
They dress it up with a fancy name.
How dare they?
Wanna see a movie today?
Word.
Cool.
Hey, guys, why do you do that?
Do what?
- It's cool.
- How?
I don't know.
It just is.
Well, let me in.
Let me in to the handshake.
I'll give you $ 1000.
Indecent Proposal.
Indecent Proposal.
Woody.
Demi.
Nice.
You two gonna fall in love?
No.
I don't know.
Tsh.
No.
So have you considered natural childbirth?
Are you kidding me?
I'll take whatever they got.
Epidural is a proper Christian woman's only chance to get wrecked.
From what I'm told, the real high is the endorphin rush of a chemical-free birth.
I read an article that said some women can actually achieve or Uh, uh No, no, no.
Thank you for the conversation.
I know what you're talking about.
That's not something a woman does on her child's head.
But Listen, backseat birther, Shirley's on her third kid.
She doesn't need a slacker with two one-eyed cats governing her body.
First of all, together, my cats can do anything.
Secondly, you're disqualified from this conversation the moment you decided to grow a wang.
I regret nothing.
I feel sorry for the airhead you're gonna knock up at 70.
You're gonna be sitting in the waiting room playing solitaire while a life is created Oh, and you're gonna squat in a babbling brook and a beautiful star child is gonna slide out on a ray of sunshine while your cats each half watch, because you're so natural.
Okay.
Oh, boy.
Okay.
Oh, boy.
Can someone please get every mop on campus?
Um Did you break water?
Is that broken water?
That's broken water!
Chang baby!
Just nice and easy.
Careful.
Oh, Father, God Almighty, this isn't happening.
It's too soon.
I don't want my baby's first memory to be Star-Burns.
- Oh, goodness.
- Okay, this is not a big deal.
Wait, I mean, it is a big deal.
It's just not a big bad deal, it's a big good deal.
If I could have everyone's attention We'd like not to have your attention.
Okay, give me your attention.
This student is having a baby.
What am I talking about?
You already know.
Okay, here's what it is.
I'm gonna go get my Prius, I'm gonna pull around the back and I'm gonna drive her to the hospital.
I drive a Prius, which is pretty cool.
Dean, go!
Dean gone.
Can you please call Andre?
He's "Sugar Boots" in my phone.
That hurts, Shirley.
Oh, I'll get it, because I am here for you.
We came so close to having one class that wasn't all about them.
Remember when they took that trip on St. Patrick's Day?
God, that was a good week.
This has got to be a Chang baby.
Changs are never born in hospitals.
More like taxicabs, hardware stores, bank lines, sewers.
My nephew Jin was born on a treadmill at Bally Total Fitness.
Twenty-percent incline.
Sugar Boots says he'll meet us at the hospital.
Now, can somebody do something about him?
I'm saying, nobody needs to freak out.
A Chang is hearty to the core.
We come out healthy.
That's why there's a billion of us.
Ever try Googling me?
Can't be done.
Ben, you have to stop freaking her out.
Hey, show me some respect.
I might be that child's estranged father.
Well, what's it gonna be?
What?
I wanna buy the rights to your handshake.
We have a deal?
We're about to take Shirley to the hospital.
This is not the time.
Oh, it's the time.
According to my watch, it's 1000 o'clock.
- Deal.
- Great.
So how does it work?
I don't know, we just do it when one of us says something awesome.
All right.
Betty Grable.
I said, "Betty Grable".
No.
Yes.
No.
Do it.
Make your money, whore.
Who's Betty Grable?
Yeah, that's the stuff.
Try to take deep breaths and relax.
Where is the dean?
Oh, my God, everything's wet.
Ugh.
Oh, That's okay.
Ooh.
That's okay because it is natural.
It's natural.
Are you uncomfortable, Britta?
- You wish.
- Ooh!
Okay.
Four hundred, 500.
It's like a million bucks in dog dollars.
Word.
What happened?
Something's off.
It's like buying candy from a baby.
What did you do?
You ruined it.
Give him back the money.
No, no, no, the money doesn't matter anymore.
Once you've sold something out, you can't get it back.
You didn't even like our handshake.
I hated it.
Now it's gone.
You two are dumber than Jackie Coogan.
He divorced Betty Grable.
Pierce tainted our special handshake with his blood money.
Now we can't get the magic back.
Holy crap, you two, for real?
Yeah.
Nobody cares about your handshake.
A baby is coming out of Shirley's vagina 2 feet from us.
Her contractions are six minutes apart.
So unless her cervix is dilated more than 8 centimeters, we have time to get her to a hospital.
I delivered a baby earlier this year.
Where was I when that happened?
I don't know, off in the background.
Did you pull your car up?
Uh, no.
It's been overturned.
- What?
- Okay, look, I don't wanna alarm anyone, but the World Food Festival has taken a dark turn.
I guess some national ethnicities don't play nice with others and things have turned into a bit of a race kerfuffle.
You mean "riot"?
Let's use "kerfuffle" for now, okay, Mr. Winger?
Oh, God.
I was just trying to feed hungry foodies.
I'm going to call an ambulance.
There's ambulances out there.
They're overturning those too.
I mean, I didn't even know there was a difference between North and South Korean barbeque.
I mean, M* A*S*H lasted longer than that war.
Get over it.
Am I right?
Don't print that.
Let's just quit jotting.
Quit Stop writing!
because of a race kerfuffle.
Ooh.
Lake Wobegon days!
Abed, what do we do?
Shirley, pretend I'm saying this in a soothing, non-robotic voice.
We won't make it to the hospital.
I'm gonna have this baby at a hospital with my husband, the father of my baby.
Unless that father is me.
In which case, what you need to do is elevate your legs over your head while facing the northeast corner of the room.
But try not to look at the door, that's bad luck.
Chang babies are very superstitious.
Also, if you can visualize a rabbit riding a dragon it'll increase his chances of winning lotteries.
Ben, corner.
Listen, Shirley, we're having the baby right here, right now.
Okay.
Get every blanket and coat you can find.
Anything soft for Shirley to lie on.
Annie, call Andre and tell him to meet us here.
What can I do?
Stop rubbing her shoulders.
What are you doing?
Being natural.
Jeff, help me move Shirley to the ground.
All right, just stand right here.
Okay.
Okay.
Easy.
Easy.
Troy, blankets.
Okay.
Okay.
Here we go.
Okay.
I just need to take a look and see how far along you are.
Oh, I'm sorry, I don't feel comfortable with you taking a tour of my nethers.
- I'd prefer if it was one of the girls.
- I can do it.
I can do it.
I'm good at looking.
I am here for you.
Okay, what do I do?
Look and see if the baby's head has reached the cervix.
No problo, Rob Lowe.
I take it the head has reached the cervix.
Oh, God.
Okay.
Oh, God.
All right.
Not to worry.
This kind of thing happens all the time.
Are a lot of babies born in classrooms?
Well, a lot more are conceived.
Heh, heh, heh.
No, Paul, that's off the record.
- And not true.
Sort of.
- Annie.
Gotta go.
Due to a conflict of genitals I've been disqualified from delivering Shirley's baby.
I'm gonna walk you through it.
I can't deliver a baby.
I'm not prepared.
I need to take a class, shadow a nurse, or at least have my mom hug me first.
Oh, God.
I'm seeing spots.
Oh, my Lord, my Lord!
Why are you doing these things to me?
How have I failed you?
Oh!
Someone's gotta calm her down.
I got this.
Shirley, look at me.
Look at my face.
Connect with me.
Ha-ha-ha!
What in the hell?
!
I don't know what to do.
Chang!
Where's Chang?
What's up, baby?
You said Chang babies all come this way?
Yup, like a bullet from a gun.
And they're all okay?
Hell, yeah.
More than okay.
Super babies.
Seven generations of little scrappers born in the worst conditions you can imagine.
Tell me.
My cousin slid out feet first in a Pickle Barrel.
My uncle was born during rainy season in a Mongolian sheep pasture.
My brother, born under a crowded noodle bar while my grandfather finished his shrimp.
Nothing can stop us.
Not the hurricanes, not the communists, not the feds, not the Girl Scouts.
What are you doing?
Get in there.
Me?
Forget it, I'm the worst.
Well, that's a discussion for a different time.
Britta, there is something in you that wants to take care of people so bad that you'll do it until you puke.
That's what Shirley needs right now.
Are you saying I'll be a good mom?
Heh, heh, what?
No.
Man, you will really force anything, won't you?
Just get in there and force that baby out of Shirley.
Step aside, people.
Britta for the win!
Get out of my way.
Okay, I'm ready.
Abed, walk me through this.
Okay, at each contraction, you need to tell Shirley to push.
That's it?
Don't tell any doctors I said this, but the bus pretty much drives itself.
Who is the bus in this scenario?
- Push.
Push.
Push.
- Push.
Push.
Push.
- Push.
Push.
Push.
- Bring it on.
Good.
- Push.
- Come on, Shirley.
The head is out!
Now, feel around the neck for the umbilical cord.
There's no cord.
I think that's a good thing.
I am nailing this.
You're doing great too.
Chang, more stories.
Okay, so in World War II, a lot of us were rounded up in labor camps, mining mostly.
Hundreds of Changs were born underneath the earth.
Most spent their first five years underground.
- Hey, I'm here.
- Oh, Andre.
Okay.
Hi, baby.
It's gonna be all right.
Okay.
Ma'am, we can take it from here.
Guys, I got it.
I'm in the zone.
Come on, Shirley.
Come on, Shirley.
Push, push, push.
- Push it.
Push it.
- Here it comes.
It's Baby Greendale.
You guys don't have to name it that.
I don't claim that power.
I'm merely the deliverer.
Britta, focus.
Oh, doy.
Okay, come on, Shirley.
Push!
Push!
Push!
Oh, it's a boy!
And it's also a black person.
Not that that's important.
- Are you sure it's yours, baby?
- Yes.
It's definitely his.
I never told you this part, but all Changs are born with tails.
You kind of dodged a bullet there.
Did that just happen?
It's back.
It never left.
Hi.
Aw.
We did it, Sugar Boots.
No, you did it, baby.
Congratulations, sir.
After a fierce campaign, I happily concede this baby to you.
Pretty classy of me.
Thank you, Chang.
Couldn't have done this without you.
No bigs.
Andre?
Yeah?
I think I wanna name him after Ben.
What?
Hm?
Really?
Really?
Yeah, I mean, you may not be his father, but you helped bring him into the world.
All right, well, we'll have our own little baby Ben Bennett.
Ben Bennett?
Oh, damn.
Mm-hm.
Okay.
No, no, no, that's fine.
Ben Bennett.
Hi, Ben Bennett.
Oh, look, he said "Chang".
No.
No, he didn't.
See?
Nothing to it.
Yeah.
Can you believe that's how we come into this world?
Screaming, crying and covered in crap.
Then somewhere along the lines we get it into our heads that we're destined for greatness.
We are.
I just yanked a little dude out of my friend.
Yeah.
I guess we passed anthropology.
Look at how teeny his hands are.
They're so little.
His fingers are like Good & Plenties.
I know, I wanna eat them.
Which is lame.
Totally.
This has been quite a day.
You can expect a cover story in the next issue.
In a good way?
Like, an article about what a good dean I am?
Absolutely.
I did it.
Heh, heh.
I did it.
I am a good dean.
I am a good dean!
Ha-ha-ha!
Whoo!
Are you sure you wanna do this?
People do it in movies, but there are real-world consequences.
I know, but if we take that test today, we are definitely going to fail it.
Okay, let's do it.
What are you guys doing?
Cancel school today or we tell everybody about this.
Deal.
{END OF EPISODE 22}{START OF EPISODE 23}
No!
Stay calm, everybody!
No, no, no!
- You can't outrun me.
- I see you, fat-ass!
No, don't shoot me!
Guys, please.
Okay, I don't even have a gun.
Isn't this against the rules?
There's only one rule, Fat Neil.
The prize goes to the last man standing.
So to speak.
If you were a dude, you'd have my fist up your balls.
Thank you, Annie.
Kick their guns to me.
Kick, don't reach.
Hey.
Christina Reachy, I said kick.
Annie, take it easy.
You gotta learn to trust people.
Can't you leave me with a little something?
We're friends, Annie, remember?
We played Dungeons & Dragons together.
That was a game.
This is paintball.
- Let's gather round.
- Okay, a couple of announcements.
I wanna thank Pistol Patty's Cowboy Creamery for sponsoring our end-of-the-year picnic.
Now, free ice cream and that one guy having a heart attack aren't the only surprises today.
We're gonna end this year with a quick game of Paintball Assassin.
Now, last year's big mistake was way too valuable a prize.
And I've been assured, huh, that this year will be different.
So take it away, Pistol Patty.
Howdy, folks.
There's only one rule: Last man standing gets the prize.
There's your guns.
And here's the prize: One hundred thousand dollars cash.
Go nuts!
Ah!
I heard you never shoot an unarmed man.
Whoever started that rumor didn't eat my beans.
Then I guess it's lucky for me I'm not unarmed.
Seeing as I'm eating your beans.
Jeff wants to see you.
Yeah?
And I want pants.
A lot of people want a lot of things.
It won't hurt to hear him out.
We got a good spot in the library.
As safe as you are here, you'll be safer with us.
I see you!
There they go!
Math Club's gotten better since last year.
They were practicing while the rest of us went on dates.
Hold on.
I have a plan.
Math Club?
- Yeah?
- I'm Asian.
You guys Asian?
That's pretty racist, man.
That wasn't a no.
I'm coming over.
Don't shoot me, shoot him.
He's white and he's out of ammo.
Crap.
Don't shoot!
- See you, Abed.
- Shoot Chang!
- He defected to the Math Club.
- Math rules!
Forget it, just a waste of ammo.
Let's go grab their paint.
Cool.
Yeah, I'm much safer with you guys.
Milady.
- What do you want, Jeff?
- Yikes.
Well, what do we all want?
Ammo.
How much you got left?
A hundred thousand dollars worth.
- We're running low too.
- Shut up, Abed.
What have you heard about Pierce?
Hear he's still alive, near the cafeteria.
I hear he has more paint than a French kindergarten.
Are you proposing we join him?
I'm proposing his ammo joins us.
You haven't changed.
You think Pierce has?
The guy's been a jerk all year.
He's a jerk because we exclude him.
We exclude him because he's a jerk.
And the last time I checked, you were the last one feeling sorry about it.
I'm waiting for you guys to come around.
Likewise.
I am dead, bro.
I'm dead.
Who wears spurs in paintball?
Who the hell are you?
The guy that's gonna win.
Come on!
Does that guy even go to this school?
He's really good-Iooking.
Like network TV good-Iooking.
See how big his guns were?
Just marry him.
Paintball is tough this year.
I agree.
Careful, you can't hit all three of us.
She won't have to.
Hey, Troy.
Abed.
I thought you were dead.
I thought you were dead.
Oh, right.
By the power invested in us as deputies, we now pronounce you arrested.
What are you, deputies of the stairwell?
Fort Hawthorne.
There's a bounty on your head, my friend.
Pierce.
My forehead's not that big, right?
Hm.
It's not small.
You let Pierce boss you around in exchange for paint pellets?
Actually, Jeff, he's been pretty decent in this game so far.
He's created a safe zone where people can rest, eat and pump breast milk.
That sounds very nice of him.
Beats standing around waiting to get picked off by the Black Rider.
Are you talking about the handsome blond cowboy with the big guns?
Is that guy a student?
Who is he?
We call him the Black Rider.
But he's not really riding anything.
Look, I don't name people, Annie.
I'm a deputy.
I deputize.
You have to surrender your guns.
And your drugs.
Drugs.
Ah.
My study group.
How long has it been?
Five hours.
Too long.
Welcome to Fort Hawthorne.
How is this even possible?
It began with a dream, Annie.
A dream and an impulse to hide in the men's room.
I found that people were willing to roll bullets under the door just for the right to take a dump.
By the way, for you guys, taking a dump is on the house.
Or if you prefer, relax and catch a show.
This is insane.
Don't worry, Jeff, I've also got someone more your speed.
Because you're gay.
All right, I think I've seen enough and I'd like my gun back now.
Only Hawthorne personnel can carry weapons inside, Jeffrey.
All right, you got us here, unarmed, at your mercy.
What do you want?
We'll discuss over dinner.
You're famished.
Tonight, we feast.
The Twinkies are wonderful tonight.
Give us some space, Miguel.
What if I told you guys I know where to find enough ammo to end this cowardly hiding out?
Split the prize seven ways.
So send your goons to get it.
They'd never bring it back.
We trust each other, we're a study group.
That's pretty warm and fuzzy talk coming from you, Pierce.
You've acted like a villain this year.
I have?
Yes.
You raped the Duquesne family.
You guys, Pierce is reaching out.
I'm not risking my butt hauling ammo for the guy that has Vicky dancing for Twinkies.
She's a dance major, Jeff.
She loves Twinkies.
And if you ever took the time to get to know her Look, uh Summer starts tomorrow.
For you guys, it means pool parties, dinners, one-night stands.
For me, it means counting down the days till next fall.
Before we go, let me do this for you.
Let me bring us victory.
Fine.
Let's do it.
- To the study group.
- To the study group.
Ah.
More juice, Miguel.
I hope we find this cache of ammunition soon.
I need to pump.
Me too.
You talking about peeing, right?
No.
Me neither.
Look, about Pierce, I feel bad.
I shouldn't put so much effort into It's okay.
I just think the study group is my family, you know?
And if we start picking and choosing Where do we stop?
I get it.
You're a good kid, and I wanna do my part to help you stay that way.
Benjamin Chang, for your betrayal of the Cheerleaders' Alliance, I sentence you to pretendsies death.
Guys, you don't have to do this.
I betrayed the Math Club for you.
Ready.
I'm sorry I told Trish about Amber.
- Aim - Fire.
Holy crap.
Not cool, bitch.
Yeah, so you told me at last year's tryouts.
Ah!
Leave the guns.
Whatev.
Who's there?
Can I join you?
- No.
- Okay.
Damn, I'm out.
Give me your gun.
All right, be careful.
Cheerleaders rule!
I'll take that.
Who are you?
I'm the bad guy.
Stop trying to fluster me with your handsomeness.
You're creepy.
Why is your chest getting all flushed?
It's a rash.
I'm allergic to beans.
Look, do you even go to school here?
Sorry, I get paid to shoot paintballs, honey, not the breeze.
Lame.
I'll hit you in the foot.
Thank you.
You're dry, sugar.
Hey.
Hey.
I'll save you for last.
You won't get the chance.
Unh!
You okay?
I got a better look at him.
He's not that good-Iooking.
Didn't he shoot you?
He tried.
He's a bad shot too?
Man, what does this guy have going for him?
Pierce loaded your gun with blanks.
No, don't shoot!
Why does this keep happening?
And what kind of ice cream company does this?
Where's the paint from last year?
I hid it.
So the school doesn't get destroyed.
Too late.
Oh, hi, Jeff.
We just ran into the Black Rider.
Dean, if you want this game to end, we need firepower.
In there.
The key's in my shorts.
I can get it out, I guess.
Now, this is more like it.
Okay, Black Rider, now let's see who's attractive.
Dude, you have a problem.
Ha, ha, ha.
Oh, nice.
Whoa, where you going?
To have a conversation with Pierce.
She's pretty awesome today.
What happened?
Black Rider.
He wiped out the whole fort.
Then why are you still here?
I can't go back out there, this is the only life I know.
Annie?
Is that you?
Did you get the ammo?
Yup.
Hey!
What are you doing?
Why's Jeff's gun loaded with blanks?
Was it?
Oh, come on, now.
Hey, hey.
Oh.
Okay.
I get it.
So once again, I'm the bad guy.
Yes.
Well, he got to win last year.
It's a game, Annie.
It's Fine.
It's a game.
Let's play.
- Put it in your holster.
- Come on, Annie.
You're my favorite, I don't wanna beat you.
I don't want Jeff to be the Put the gun in your holster and let's play the game.
Right.
So you can shoot me and play without me.
That's this group's favorite thing.
We're always nice to you, Pierce.
Wrong.
Wrong.
Three days ago, I walked in on you guys playing cards without me.
Three days ago.
We weren't playing cards, we were voting.
And you weren't invited because we were voting about you.
What?
We were taking a vote on whether we'd invite you back to the group next year.
Lucky for you, it had to be unanimous.
There was one holdout.
One red card.
Pick it up.
Black Rider.
It's Jeff Winger.
I know you've heard of me by now.
No.
He's lying.
Look, if you're half the cool cowboy you pretend to be, you'll respect that we've got a situation playing out here and let us be until it's settled.
Sure thing.
And once it's settled, I'm taking out everybody in this room.
Oh.
Starting with you, Mr. Insecure.
You think you're good-Iooking, but you're not.
You're average.
You're just an average-Iooking guy with a big chin.
What's going on?
He's faking it.
- Something's wrong.
- It's fake.
Last week he did it to get out of letting me have gum.
He's old, it could be real.
It's real.
It is.
Argh!
The gurgling's a nice touch.
You guys are terrible.
Eh, we warned you.
Buddy, are you all right?
You want me to call 911?
Sucker!
Son of a bitch, seriously?
Told you, dude.
I'm the best!
You're the worst.
I'm out of the group?
You're out of mine!
And I'm winning!
We've created a monster.
Let's not give ourselves too much credit.
I'm out.
Some old guy pretended to have a heart attack.
Shot me in the gut.
I don't care, that's your problem.
This school sucks.
Well, then why do you go here?
I wouldn't go to this toilet with my big sister's toe.
I take a class online.
I was paid to be here and win the game so my boss could keep his money.
You work for the ice cream company?
Sweetie, this thing is so much bigger than you can even imagine.
I'm out of here, I got Coldplay tickets.
Coldplay?
Too late, bean allergy, you blew it.
Hello?
Anybody?
Does anyone have an alliance I can join?
I'm really loyal.
Am I out?
- In formation.
- Blue Leader, standing by.
Blue Leader, stand by.
- Red 5, standing by.
- White Clones, standing by.
On your knees.
No Greendale student can be allowed to win this game.
Initiate Plan  Operation Total Invasion.
{END OF EPISODE 23}{START OF EPISODE 24}
Dean?
Dean?
Don't shoot, red-haired guy.
Why not?
Something's not right about the game.
We just took out a professional paintball assassin.
A professional?
Aah!
That doesn't make sense.
Why would someone who gets paid to do things be at Greendale?
Aah!
No!
No, no!
I'm not playing!
I'm not playing!
No, I'm the dean!
Stop shooting me!
Aah!
- Man's down.
- Copy that.
Hi, Pistol Patty.
Did they take you hostage?
Dean Spreck?
Hello, Craig.
City College.
Now I understand everything.
Now your whole evil plan is clear as day.
But if you need to explain it to your men, I understand.
It's simple, Craig.
I pose as a fake ice cream company, sponsor your end-of-the-year picnic and waved enough money under your students' noses to provoke them to destroy their own campus.
Who hurt you, Steven?
How could any dean be so mean?
Oh, you haven't seen how mean this dean can be-ean.
- There's one.
- Go!
- After them.
- Go, go, go!
Wait, did you say "bean"?
Guys.
Guys!
City College is trying to destroy Greendale.
They're an unstoppable juggle knob.
"Juggernaut".
Juggernaut.
Which means, if we're gonna fight them, we have to form a school-wide alliance of rebels.
It seems we've left the Western motif and are entering a Star Wars scenario.
- Aw.
- I wish it happened sooner too.
If we surrender our individuality to form a faceless regime, how are we better?
You're the worst.
Okay, she is just saying that to fit in.
The floor recognizes Magnitude.
First off: Pop, pop!
I love it.
Second, Magnitude's a one-man party.
A one-man party can't be in an alliance.
That's a paradox.
I agree to disagree.
Paradox, we're on the same side.
Hasn't the other side already won?
Their goal was to make us trash the school.
We trashed it.
We still might hit them where it hurts.
Their balls?
No.
Just below their balls?
Their wallet, Leonard.
I think it's called a "taint".
Why do you think they sent in a ringer to win?
It must be because we're entitled to the prize they promised, a hundred G's.
Ooh, I could use that money.
This is why we have to agree, right now, that whoever wins, we give the money to Greendale.
No!
What?
!
To repair the damage and save our school.
Abed, tell them.
Whatever.
I ain't in it for your revolution.
I'm in it for me.
Wait, Abed, this was your idea.
But I'm calling dibs on the Han Solo role before Jeff slouches into it.
Star-Burns, I need that vest.
Pfft.
Oh, yeah, right.
Give me the vest, laser breath, before our conversation gets nasty.
Question.
How long is the game gonna last?
Andre's home with the baby Shirley, forget your newborn child and think about the people that need you.
I can't afford to lose a single soldier.
What?
Oh, now you're the leader?
I don't see you stepping up.
I don't step up to being leader.
I reluctantly accept it when it's thrust upon me.
- Oh, Jeff.
- You know, you're an idiot.
Oh, my God.
What is that?
Oh, my God, is he okay?
Magnitude.
Pop Po P "Pop"?
Pop what?
Pop what?
What is he trying to say?
Pop what, Magnitude?
!
You sons of bitches.
Can you hear me?
Who is this?
Oh, that's Jeff Winger.
You are in trouble now.
Jeffrey, it's your friend, the dean.
I'm safe.
Sit down.
I can hear you, Mr. Winger.
This is City College's Dean Spreck.
Hey, Spreck, you cheat.
You can't spray people with paint by remote.
And you can't have City College students in a Greendale game.
My men have been registered at Greendale for weeks.
As for rules, they're clearly defined in your school's agreement with my fake ice-cream company.
If you get paint on you, you're out.
I'm glad to see there's paperwork, because we are going to win, and you are gonna pay.
Yay!
Go, Jeff Winger's study group.
Those guys are ballers, yo.
I hope you like getting balled.
Sir, this guy tried to charge us three paintballs to use the bathroom.
We were gonna shoot him, but tell him what you told us.
Don't shoot me.
Great.
Now shoot him.
Sure, shoot me.
You'd certainly be doing Jeff Winger a big favor.
Greendale Human Beings, it is now clear that we have no choice but to team up and defeat City College.
I also have no choice but to accept the role thrust upon me.
And what role would that be?
No time to squabble, Troy.
"For Greendale," on three.
One, two Jeff, every second counts.
"For Greendale," on two.
One Guys.
- For Greendale!
- For Greendale!
Greendale students, I understand you've unified and intend to draw this game out.
Well, if it's a war you want, it's a war you will lose.
City College is stronger, faster.
Our sperm counts are higher, even in our women.
Resistance is as pointless as your degrees.
Honestly, ask yourself, what does "Liberal Arts" even mean?
- "Welcome to Greendale.
- You're already accepted".
Ha.
Losers.
What the hell?
Welcome to Greendale.
You're already dead.
Jackpot.
Shirley, you keep watch while we get these.
Here, help me with this.
Sure thing, your worship.
Abed.
Stop trying to be Han Solo, it's making me embarrassed for you.
Come on, admit it, you like it.
I like having conversations with adults.
Playing Star Wars is worn out and immature.
You like me because I'm immature.
There's not enough immaturity in your life.
I hope I don't get shot waiting out here.
I'd hate to go home to my babies.
Reconnaissance indicates the key to City College's strategy is the Gatling gun inside the ice-cream truck, which we'll charge en masse, overwhelming their defenses, and taking that gun for ourselves.
Well, that's not how I would proceed.
Do you happen to have a better plan?
I do happen, Jeff.
I happen very much.
We use sneak attacks to draw their patrols to the library, where one of us will pull the fire alarm, activating the sprinklers, which I will have rigged, to shower everything in the building with paint.
Paint in sprinklers?
Are we the Little Rascals?
I was.
Have you heard your plan?
You wanna charge a machine gun.
I've got something to say.
I don't take orders from girls, because they don't talk to me.
Watch it, quasar face.
Annie's a good kid and a better shot.
So listen up or you'll be floating home.
Thank you, Abed.
Sorry"Han".
Okay, I think we should split the troops in half and carry out both plans simultaneously.
Troy, your plan will lure people off the ice cream truck, allowing Jeff's troops to take the stronghold.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
I'm so glad that we didn't shoot you.
Now we have the advantage of knowing that Jeff Winger wants to be a ballerina and that his Achilles heel is"wieners".
That's just the tip of the iceberg.
For one more pudding, I'll tell you why he's jealous of me.
They kicked you out of study group after two years?
Yeah.
What took them so long?
Hey, thanks for sticking up for me back there.
This group gets so tangled in each others' feelings.
You're a hero for standing outside of it.
Heroes are great, but I'll take a blaster every time.
Anyway, just wanted to let you know, I don't think you're immature.
I think you're great, for a no-good, laser-faced, Jabba scoundrel.
You're good, kid.
Don't get cocky.
Hey!
- Ow!
Ow!
Damn, my leg.
- Take cover.
They're right on our tail.
Operation Troy's Awesome Plan is living up to its name.
Good for you.
Looks like they're taking Troy's bait.
Squad B commencing Operation Actual Operation.
Everyone look alive.
Leonard, good enough.
Greendale, it's been a pleasure fighting with you.
Some of us won't make it, but there is a place where we will see each other again, and that place is Denny's.
Which Denny's?
We'll figure it out later.
The one near the 15 exit, I'm banned.
Then I'll see you in hell.
Let's kick some taint.
Okay.
On my count.
One, two Vicki!
- Go, go, go.
- Lock the doors.
Seal the room.
All right, Shirley, you have the most important job, okay?
Yeah, pull the fire alarm.
Can we move this along?
I'm missing CSI.
Enemy soldiers are incoming.
Everyone evacuate through the air ve - Garrett.
- I may be stuck in this vent.
It is too early to tell.
- They're all over the place.
- They're all over the place.
I think our only choice is to try and shoot our way out.
Right.
Commence Operation Troy's Awesome Leadership is Never in Doubt.
Ugh!
That's affirmative.
That gun's too powerful.
I'm scared.
Hey, Quendra with a "Q-U," they can kill most of us, but as long as nobody gives up, somebody will make it through.
Understand?
Yes.
Charge!
Well, I'm out.
We lost.
See you at Denny's?
Denny's is for winners.
We've got two Human Beings trapped outside of the library.
- Keep them pinned down.
- It won't be long now.
Leonard, we're losing.
Britta, I've been in a few real wars, but this one is actually the most terrifying.
Guys, we're dying out here.
Well, we're dying too.
They've trapped us in a dead end.
Hey, kid.
Someone's gotta make it out of here alive.
- We're taking fire.
- We're pulling back.
Pulling back.
Fall back to placement positions.
We're gonna need help.
I had a dream it would end this way.
Take him.
Shirley, nobody's making it out of the library.
Pull the alarm.
Britta, are you alive?
Britta?
Britta?
Aw, hell.
Someone's gotta win this.
Aw.
I'm eliminated.
I'm out.
Me too.
Alpha 17, move in.
Looks like this is it.
Will you be Han Solo after we die?
Afraid not, doll.
Once I'm gone, I'm gone.
Oh.
Okay.
Ugh, gotta do everything myself.
- We're all dead.
All of us.
- Paint is raining from the sky.
Everyone in the library is dead.
Damn it.
Kill him.
Yes, sir.
Unh It's my heart.
Buddy, you okay?
Cool.
Hoo.
Eat paint, you Stormtrooping, City College knob gobblers.
- Codger down.
- You're it, kid.
Covering the right flank.
Okay, looks like we got her.
Shirley.
What are we supposed to do?
How about we save this school's ass?
Deal.
Go, go, go.
Hold on.
Hold on!
- Unh!
- Yeah!
- You'd better watch it.
- Oh!
Aw.
That's it.
I think that's it.
Is that it?
We win.
We won!
Oh!
We win.
We win!
Jeffrey.
Unh!
- We win.
- We win.
- Yes.
Ha, ha, ha.
- What?
All right.
Way to shoot.
- All right, we did it.
- Yeah, way to go.
Yes.
Who are you?
Your mother's lover.
Unh!
- What?
- What?
- That's low.
- Oh, man.
I win.
- All right!
- All right!
You owe me a hundred G's.
And you can make the check out to Greendale.
Human Beings!
Human Beings!
Human Beings!
Human Beings!
Human Beings!
Human Beings!
- Thank you.
- Oh, that's very good.
- Okay.
- It's nice.
Final meeting of the semester now in session.
Final order of business, pick a class we can all take in the fall.
We could just take Anthro 201.
Risky.
Sequels are almost always disappointing.
Since when are you in favor of playing it safe, Han?
Cool down, Annie.
I was only Han Solo because the context demanded it.
But here.
Oh.
Star-Burns.
He uses a crystal instead of deodorant.
Guys, I know exactly what we should do.
We should see what Troy thinks we should do.
He had some good ideas today.
Thanks, man.
Okay.
I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided we should sleep on it.
Just came back for my day planner.
Pretend I'm not even here.
You guys are great at that.
Come on, Pierce.
We all know there is no "day planner".
Here it is.
If you'll excuse me, I'm running late to drink a bottle of wine in my bathing suit.
Pierce, wait.
You know I've been coming to this school for 12 years?
And I've never been friends with anyone here more than a semester.
Probably for the same reason I've been married seven times.
I guess I assume, eventually, I'll be rejected.
So I, you know, test people, push them, until they prove me right.
It's a sickness.
I admit it.
But this place has always accepted me, sickness and all.
This place accepted all of you, sickness and all.
It's worth thinking about.
Um, I think we have thought about it, Pierce, and you're right.
And we were just picking a class we could all be in this fall.
And we'd love for you to join us.
No, thanks.
I'm done with you guys.
I like this school, but I'm done with whatever you call this.
Adiós.
He was my ride.
I'm going after him.
No, he's just acting out.
I've seen this behavior before.
In cats.
My cats.
It's true.
And now he'll come slinking back in five, four, three, two
