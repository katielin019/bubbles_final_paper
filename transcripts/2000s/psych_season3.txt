{START OF EPISODE 1}
Previously on Psych I needed to talk to you.
Just say it, say what it is.
I don't want to feel guilty about moving on with my life.
Your mother's not a part of it anymore.
Look.
I don't care what you do, okay?
I don't care.
Mom?
Dispatch, we've located the stolen vehicle.
Occupants inside.
Approaching now.
10-4, proceed with caution.
Henry, you don't wanna do this.
I don't have a choice, Ray.
Think of the consequences.
I'm way past consequences.
This needs to end tonight.
Whoops.
Whoops?
It's my neighbor's car.
We were gonna put it back.
It was just a dare.
Is there a problem here, Officer?
You wanted my attention, Shawn, you got it, buddy.
Wait.
You guys know each other?
Yeah.
He's sort of my dad.
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for that "World's Greatest Dad" mug back.
You just keep talking, Shawn.
You keep talking.
Oh, don't worry, I will.
Like when I read you your rights.
Oh, I have rights?
That'll be new and fun.
What am I gonna tell your mother?
I don't know, you think you can get a hold of her new phone number?
I hope it was worth it, smart-ass.
This officially ends your chance of being a cop.
Let's be honest, I gave up wanting to be like you a long time ago.
That's it!
Somebody book him.
You, beanpole!
Get over here.
Fingerprint him, now.
Oh, I'm, I'm sorry.
Me?
Never mind, rookie, I'll do it myself.
Burton Guster.
Dude.
I'm freaking out.
You have to help me.
What's wrong?
My mom is here.
She's back in the country?
Back in the country?
Try, try back in the city.
Try downstairs in my dad's kitchen.
Where are you?
Hiding out in my bedroom.
Oh, my God!
Holy crap.
I just found an entire unopened box of Shrinky Dinks.
You're hiding in your bedroom because your mom came to visit?
Dude, you've got problems.
Are you hearing what I'm saying?
My mom is standing downstairs, in my dad's kitchen, laughing it up, having a grand old time.
You don't think that's a little weird?
And you're unhappy she's here?
No, I'm not unhappy she's here I don't know.
I haven't seen her in three years.
She used to tell me everything.
What's she doing here?
Working.
For the police department?
I guess, I don't know.
I haven't found out much because, apparently, it's 1988 in my house and no one felt the need to tell me anything.
I know my dad is behind all of this Oh, my God!
Furby!
Dude, did you know I had a Furby?
Shawn, I have no time for this.
I've got my own problems.
I have to go see Frankjim Ogletree.
Frankjim Ogletree?
Is that a person or a hippopotamus?
He's the new Regional Sales Manager.
My immediate boss.
And a tyrant.
They call him the little Pinochet.
That's too abstract.
Why don't they just call him "jerk pants"?
Or "Suck McJones"?
They're MIT guys, Shawn.
Now, go face your parents.
You've been wanting to see your mom for ever.
And tell her I'm coming by for some Jell-O cake.
Holy Dude!
I just found a pristine issue of Dynamite magazine with Square Pegs on the cover.
Hold on, I'm gonna read "Bummers" to you.
The cheese knife is in the same place, right?
Yeah, it's right there.
You want me to give you a hand, hon?
Did you just call me "honey"?
I did not.
I was going to say "hunchback.
" Oh, Shawnie, look at this.
Not only does your father own a very expensive bottle of Bordeaux, he hand-made little cucumber sandwiches.
Do you believe that?
Wow, he is just chock full of surprises today.
Well, I'm allowed to expand my horizons, right?
I am so glad to see you, Mom.
What are you doing in town?
Well, some police departments occasionally call me up to come back and do psych evaluations.
How long have you known about this?
Not long.
I almost didn't do it.
I changed my mind at the last second.
I'm doing Santa Barbara PD, a few in San Diego, the Bay area.
When are our dinner reservations, Henry?
Oh, there's dinner plans tonight?
You can make it, right?
Of course he can make it.
Of course I will come, I just Need to cancel a date but that is not a big deal.
You made other plans?
I didn't make other plans.
I didn't know.
Didn't know what?
That you were coming.
Henry, why didn't you tell him I was coming?
He doesn't have a phone.
You don't have a phone?
What I do.
Are you having money problems?
Henry, why don't you buy him a phone?
Mom, I'm fine.
I'm not having money problems.
I dropped my phone while I was solving a very important crime.
I was on the front page of the newspaper yesterday.
Yeah.
May I speak with you privately?
What the hell is going on in there?
I tried to tell you, Shawn.
Allow me to demonstrate trying.
"Shawn, guess who's coming back into the country on Friday?
"Your mother.
" That's it.
Mission accomplished.
All right!
Look, I wanted to clear the air on a few things before she got here.
Clear the air?
You think you can undo 15 years of hard feelings with a bottle of Pinot Bordeaux.
I didn't even know Walmart had a wine cellar.
Look, would give me a break?
I'm just trying to make a nice night here for her here.
You're sabotaging me.
Why would I do that?
I don't know, but I'm gonna figure it out.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Ogletree?
Shut the door, Burton.
I was reading the paper yesterday and something caught my attention.
Have to say I was surprised, considering you seem to already have a full-time job.
This is just something I do on the side.
A hobby, really.
Like collecting thimbles or raising carrier pigeons.
You raise carrier pigeons?
No.
Not at all.
That's totally lame.
I just said that because I was flustered.
I raise carrier pigeons.
I'm glad you said that, because I was afraid to tell you how cool I thought carrier pigeons are.
Flying around and carrying stuff.
Coming back.
Awesome, I hear that.
Are you familiar with the exclusivity clause in your contract?
It means we don't allow second jobs.
Jobs?
No, no.
Psych is more like community service.
And it never affects my work.
This photo was taken Thursday night, I noticed you signed out early that day.
I think the important thing is I signed out.
Let's roll back the clock, shall we?
Monday, the 28th, you had three appointments.
You missed all of them.
Tuesday, the 29th, you disappeared after lunch.
And Wednesday, well, here you are.
You did your entire week's work in one afternoon.
It was a crazy week.
It seems to me you had a crazy year.
I have taken the liberty of preparing this for you.
What is this?
It's a termination notice.
Or, you could quit your other job.
You tell me.
Good choice.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Shawn, you don't have to walk me through the whole building.
I used to do quite a few sessions here.
This is where I met your father.
I know.
I heard the story.
You did his evaluation after he shot some drug dealer.
He told you that?
He twisted his ankle doing security for the Cinnamon Festival.
I had to clear him for duty.
Figures, that's about par.
What happened?
He said the two of you are getting along better.
Mom, the last thing I wanna do right now is talk about Henry.
Okay, that's fair.
Let's talk about you.
Who was that date you had to cancel on Friday?
Ah, it was just some girl I met.
She was a museum curator.
It's not a big deal, Mom.
I doubt it would've worked out anyway.
How many dates?
That would've been the first.
Shawn.
Mom.
Come on, Goose, whenever we talk, you're always about to not go on a second date with somebody new.
I happen to be excellent at first dates.
You know who is having multiple dates?
Dad.
I believe he's up to number eight with his Jekyll and Hyde English girlfriend.
You guys should connect more often.
He told me they broke it off a few weeks ago.
We're talking about him again.
Yes, we are.
Let's stop.
I should let you go.
How many of these do you have to do, anyway?
Oh, three uniforms and a detective.
Oh.
You wanted to see me, Chief?
Yes.
It has come to my attention, Detective, that you've discharged your weapons in the last four cases you've worked.
Thank you.
That wasn't a compliment.
I'm just trying to keep the streets safe, Chief.
The last incident was at a cat show.
Well, let me just go on record as saying that I would never shoot a cat.
I guess I could find some solace in that.
Unless it was approaching in a threatening manner or refused to stop upon my command.
I would probably just fire a warning shot to make my point but it's really a field decision.
I can't commit to it at this juncture.
I've requested a department-sanctioned psychologist to come here and have a session or two with you.
I'm just gonna have to say no.
That wasn't a question.
Could you phrase it like one?
Hey, Katie.
Kathy.
Shawn.
Shawn?
What the hell are you doing here?
I should ask you the same question.
I work here.
Okay.
I should ask you a different question.
Why didn't you return my calls all weekend?
Shawn, I had no other choice about all this.
Oh, my God.
This isn't a joke!
You're really quitting Psych?
I'm so sorry, Shawn.
In a text message, no less?
I couldn't think of any other way to tell you.
I knew you would just try to convince me to stay.
Listen, maybe we can still do it on the weekends.
If you're ready to hear some good news, I have worked out a compromise that will solve all of this.
Really?
Yes.
You quit this job.
This job, you quit!
We take on extra cases to make up the difference in salary.
I make 48 grand a year, Shawn.
What is that?
Yen?
Who needs $48,000 to live?
I need 32.
The other 16 generally goes to you.
Don't be ridiculous.
I claimed you on my taxes, Shawn.
Holy crap, is this Bianca's pappardelle?
Mmm-hmm, I found it in the kitchen fridge.
Oh, my God, she's going to go insane.
She hand-rolls the pasta every weekend, Shawn.
They take all day.
She grinds her own spices, Shawn!
Well, I thought it was for everybody.
Crap.
Burton?
Bianca.
Paul would like to see you.
Mr. Haversham?
Really?
Lovely.
I'll be there in a second.
What does she do?
She's Haversham's secretary.
Is Haversham the guy who tried to fire you?
No.
He's that guy's boss.
Everybody's boss.
He's the VP.
Perfect.
He's the one we have to convince to let you keep doing both jobs.
But I need a second.
I gotta clean my teeth before we go in.
No.
No, no, Shawn.
You're leaving now.
Gus, I'm not budging until we make this nice.
All right, but you asked for it.
Asked for what?
Let go of me!
Don't you dare go boneless on me, Shawn!
Okay!
Lower back.
You see?
That's why it's not Oh!
You son of a bitch!
You wanted to see me?
Yes, I did.
I have a project for you.
Have a seat.
Is that your wife?
My grandmother.
Tell her I said she's lovely.
She died.
I'm going to sit down now.
Lots of talk about this in the office.
Yes, sir.
I'm aware of that, and I've already taken care of it.
I don't think you have.
When my wife and I moved into our house, we were met with a series of unexplained disturbances.
Perhaps fueled by my wife's predilection for the supernatural.
Well, after a while it stopped.
But recently, these occurrences have returned.
To the point where my wife is staying with her mother.
Mr. Haversham, why are you telling me this?
Because I believe my wife believes our house is haunted, and I would like to hire you.
Gus, I had a strange feeling I was needed.
Cool, huh?
Looks like word getting out about you moonlighting isn't the worst thing in the world.
Let's be clear.
Haversham is the most powerful man in this office.
He's gonna be running this company sometime soon.
Give the man the respect he deserves.
What is this?
His company bio.
Learn it.
"Bred for success"?
His father is William Haversham.
Genius entrepreneur.
This guy grew up under the tutelage of a business master and real estate magnate.
I know him.
He's the one who built the Poliodome.
Polodome.
That's a much less depressing name.
Should we go?
No.
Meet me at Haversham's at 7:00.
I think I can handle that.
And no whimpering.
And no screaming.
No running from anything.
I don't care how spooky his old house is.
Haversham thinks my nickname is Fearless Guster.
Well, do you want to start some sort of recording device?
No.
I don't record my sessions.
I prefer just to talk.
How do you remember the important things?
You've heard of a photographic memory?
Well, I have a bit of I guess you'd call it an eidetic tonal memory.
So, you'll remember everything I've said?
Pretty much.
Yes.
Would you like to start?
Yes, first question, where's the bug?
The what?
The bug.
Nothing new in this area.
Must be concealed on your person.
I honestly don't have anything on me.
Then you wouldn't be opposed to me patting you down?
Actually, I'm very opposed to that.
Would you be willing to submit to a polygraph?
Shawn, don't do this to me.
You are late.
At this moment, you are officially late!
Just call me when you get here.
Hello?
Is somebody there?
I just heard you squeak.
Damn you, Shawn!
I thought you were a ghost from outside.
And yet, you still came in all by your lonesome.
Fearless Guster impresses.
How did you get inside the house?
Hadewych, the housekeeper.
She was leaving so she let me in.
Tiny little dollop of a woman, Dutch-Indonesian.
Enormous forearms.
She made me a pannekoek.
It's like a pancake but it is the size of a manhole cover!
Are you wearing Haversham's robe?
Yep.
You should try it.
The worm that spins this silk is extinct.
You can't find these.
Take it off.
I can't.
Hello?
Where are your clothes?
In the dryer.
In the dryer?
Well, the sauna was a little bit hotter than I was expecting!
Mr. Haversham.
We got here early.
Hadewych let us in.
We love her, and we'd like one of our own.
Is that an ascot?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
I like it.
It's a classic accoutrement.
It's nice to see someone with a sense of tradition.
Gus and I are both huge fans of the classics.
To be completely honest, I'm surprised he isn't wearing his spats this evening.
Can we see the epicenter of the ghoulish activity?
Please, don't touch anything.
I'm sorry, Mr. Haversham, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to touch absolutely everything.
Including this naked lady lamp.
I almost might have to sniff some stuff.
Possibly lick some things.
These Tootsie Roll pops come to mind.
Are you a skeptic, sir?
Elaine's the real believer, so I guess you could say that.
Just as I thought.
Please leave.
What?
Shawn!
I'm sorry, sir.
You are a skeptic.
Therefore, you must wait in the hall, preferably at the end.
You're killing all of my jujubes.
Jujubes are candies.
Exactly.
You better take off that robe.
I will.
And I know what you're trying to do.
What?
Innocently flip through a photo album?
No.
You're sabotaging this on purpose.
Why would I do that?
To get me fired so I have no other choice but to go back to Psych.
That's actually an ingenious plan.
But that's not how I play, Gus.
I play fair, and I roll hard.
I'm gonna find this man's ghost and I will rid him of it.
Did Haversham have any enemies?
Not really.
Corporate thinks he's a magician.
He completely revamped our inventory system.
Really?
Whole system from A to Z, including M?
All the vowels?
This guy sounds like a real maverick.
Mr. Haversham, allow me to say this is my most valuable work experience yet.
Well?
Allow me to say that I'm not impressed.
Duly noted.
Magnum!
Quiet, boy!
Stop that!
Quiet, boy!
What is he barking at?
I don't know, he never barks.
Come on, boy.
Come on, that's it.
Here we go.
Dude, look at you.
You were cool as a cucumber while that went down.
Fearless Guster is a badass.
Let's check the basement.
I can't.
Why not?
My feet won't move.
So?
How did it go?
I'm winning.
How are you winning?
I answered every question in character as Tom "Gunny" Highway.
Who is Tom "Gunny" Highway?
Clint Eastwood's character in Heartbreak Ridge.
It's not a contest, Carlton.
Don't kid yourself, O'Hara, you'll only come out losing.
Losing what?
Why are we going to the basement?
Because, Gus, that's where ghosts do their thing.
It's cold, and dark, and dusty.
Excuse me.
Can I help you two?
Yeah, we're just gonna check out the basement.
We don't go to the basement.
He doesn't go to the basement.
Why is that?
Mold spores.
My wife had some workers here.
You can get to the door, but you can't get in 'cause it's bolted shut.
I still think it's probably worth Is that hot chocolate?
It's Dutch cocoa.
Hadewych makes a pot for me each night before she leaves.
I see.
Mr. Haversham, in order to fully understand the connection that you have with this ghost, I will need to see what you see, wear what you wear, drink what you drink.
You're saying you'd like some hot chocolate?
Yes.
With marshmallows, please.
Right.
What?
It's Dutch!
It tastes like it was dipped straight out of Willy Wonka's river.
Would you get serious?
Well, he's not the most gracious host, you know.
If he'd just offered I wouldn't have had to ask.
And that pannekoek?
Not nearly as filling as it may have seemed.
You're getting hot chocolate on the floor.
Did you see that?
What the hell is Magnum!
Down, boy!
That dog is kind of an "A" hole.
It sees something.
Yeah, urine stains on my pants.
So, what do we do now?
I think we stay here.
We close the blinds.
We lock the doors.
We call it a night.
Del Taco?
Del Taco?
No, not me.
I'm going out there.
Are you kidding me?
Shawn, this is what we do.
There's a ghost out there, so would you cut the We need to do this Okay, fine.
Do you have high-end energy efficient xenon flashlights?
Pardon me for saying so, but Fearless Guster sucks.
I don't care what you say, we're solving this case.
So suck it up.
Suck what up?
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
I don't know.
You got my mind all messed up.
I'm going that direction.
She went that way.
Good luck.
Hey, it's me.
Not letting you do this alone.
Where is he?
I got her!
What do you mean, you got her?
What is going on here?
I don't know.
I realized something.
Yesterday, with all that talk about weapons, I neglected to ask you a very important question.
What kind of gun do you carry?
Would you like to see it?
I would love to.
Picked this up with a little extra cash after I decided not to go with a divorce attorney.
You're going through a separation?
Well, yeah.
Yeah, it's You know, she went with one of these high-powered ambulance chasers but that's just her insecurities, you know.
You know who you remind me of?
Who?
Did you ever see that movie Heartbreak Ridge?
Mold spores, Shawn.
Well, I'm attracted to places I'm not allowed to go.
Good luck with your stachybotros virus.
Listen, man, we need to wrap this up quickly.
I have dinner plans with my mom tonight.
I've hardly had a chance to see her at all.
Shawn.
What?
Hadewych!
It's okay, I'm Shawn Spencer, it's me and my partner, Lemongrass Gogoloab.
Have you noticed anything strange?
Only now.
We saw a woman in the woods last night that may not have been alive.
Saturday, the missus, she leave.
Go to mother's, yes?
Sunday, I forget my bag, come back.
I hear voices, lady voices in the house.
What did you do?
I leave.
Too much strangeness here lately.
Something's off with that woman, Shawn.
Okay.
Nothing's happening.
I gotta go.
What?
Gus, we made plans.
My dad has been manipulating her time all week.
Shawn, let me be clear.
I'm not leaving here until Haversham not only wants me to keep moonlighting at Psych forever, but also makes me a partner.
Sorry, buddy.
Wait, what's this?
Are you leaving?
Mr. Haversham, it is my belief that we have done all there is to do here tonight.
Tomorrow, we will look into the history of the house, see if there's anything there that can help us.
Just don't have any leads at this point.
So, I think we should all pat each other on the backs for a job well done so far, reconvene first thing in the morning for a nice farmer's breakfast.
I have dinner plans with my mother.
Oh, you made it.
I was sure you weren't gonna make it.
I'm sorry, Ma.
You've no idea the day I've just had.
Well, I'm just running to the ladies'.
We're right over there.
We?
Oh.
Your father was lonely and I thought I might have to eat dinner alone, so I let him tag along.
That's fine, right?
You're absolutely certain he's my father?
Oh!
Hey, Shawn.
Grab a menu.
We already ordered.
I'm sure it's all right.
All right, what is this?
What is what?
This.
What is all of this?
The aftershave, pumiced scalp, the suit.
I can wear a suit.
Which one of the three tenors did you borrow that from?
Not the dead one, I hope.
It's my suit, Shawn.
I dress up occasionally.
You have a problem with that?
No.
I have a problem with this pretend Henry that showed up when Mom got to town.
I don't know where you're going with this.
You're acting like a phony and you know it, and it's bugging the hell out of me.
Look at yourself!
Shawn, I order a braised quail salad and all of a sudden you think I'm putting on airs?
Excuse me.
Who here has the guinea hen crostone with the liver pancetta?
That'd be me.
Everybody here is ordering it.
Look, I'm I'm just gonna make this easier for both of us, okay?
I know exactly what you're up to.
And I'm not gonna let it happen.
Let what happen, Shawn?
Yeah, if you don't mind my saying so, you've been a real jerk to me all week.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you that your mother was coming back into town.
I'm sorry you think that I messed up your whole youth.
I'm sorry you think that I screwed up your life.
Get over it.
You had your chance.
Now, leave her alone.
Shawn Did you know that Ogletree raises carrier pigeons?
Hello?
Hello?
That's strange.
Who called?
Me.
You?
Well, there it is again.
That's my number.
From work?
No, from here.
The call is coming from inside the house.
Put it on speaker.
Hello?
Who is this?
Does this number have any other extensions?
No.
Well, there's one, but it's not plugged in.
Where is it?
I'll go check it out.
It's up in the attic.
The attic?
I'll stay on the line.
You Good luck.
Come on.
Don't be mad.
You haunted my boss' house?
It was the only way to show him how important and needed you are.
Look how brave you've been.
If we're being honest, I think this has been a real confidence booster for you, buddy.
Plus, once you solve the case, you're a hero, he never bothers you again.
Maybe you get a numbered space in the green lot.
Shawn, stop it.
How did you even Gus.
Friday, after you quit our business, I went to your office in hopes of haunting your Regional Sales Manager, Ogletree.
Unfortunately, he doesn't believe in ghosts, so I had to go a little higher on the rung.
Luckily for me, Katie from Accounts Receivable gave me a little tip about Haversham's wife.
I finally got to use my air conditioner and heating guy disguise.
I had an ultrasonic beeper in my pocket for the dog.
I actually thought you caught that one for a second.
Dude, hear me.
Hadewych!
Don't ever, ever put dry ice in your mouth.
Doesn't matter how well you wrap it up.
Okay.
What about the old woman?
Young woman.
She does Shakespeare in the Parking Lot down at the Albertsons by La Cumbre Plaza.
She was all stoked to finally have a paying gig.
And ditching the dress in the woods?
That was just an improv because who knew Fearless Guster would come after her, you badass.
The rest of it was pretty simple, really.
I even visited Alice Bundy in prison to get a few pointers.
How do we solve it?
Solve what?
The ghost.
How do we solve a case where you're the culprit?
That is a very good question.
I hadn't thought that far ahead.
You haven't thought that far ahead?
Well, give me a second.
I'm hiding under the towel.
And then I realize, the towel is my life, and the pool is third grade, and the high dive is my father.
Wow!
Oh, wow, I I poured out to you secrets even I didn't know I had.
That was amazing!
I mean, so liberating to trust someone with your darkest innermost secrets.
Where have you been?
Why haven't you been here before?
I used to be here quite a bit.
I just recently came back.
I know someone here who works for the department occasionally.
Actually, he's my son.
Really?
Well, you know, I know pretty much everybody who comes through the department.
What's his name?
Shawn Spencer.
Ghost gone.
Just like that?
Just like that.
It's split.
It's history.
Will not be bothering you again.
And that is a guarantee.
One hundred percent.
How can you guarantee?
Please, don't ask.
Just enjoy.
And now, regarding our fee.
Of course, there will be no charge.
Knowing that you appreciate the work that Gus does for the community And for the company.
It's more than enough reward.
But if you were to insist on some sort of expense reimbursement, we, of course, would not accept.
Hmm.
Please, have a seat.
I have a bit of a sixth sense myself, Mr. Guster.
Helps me out when a business deal is about to go south.
And it's bothering me right now.
I don't understand this guarantee, and I don't like it.
Last night, when that call came in, Guster, you went upstairs.
At the end of that call, I heard something that made me question all of this.
What was it?
It was the voice.
Something was wrong with it.
What was wrong with it?
It said "Gus.
" Gus?
Just like that.
Well, sir, I am pretty sure that that can be easily explained.
Yes.
I'm sure that it can.
But there's something I really need for you to do for me right now.
Yes?
Leave.
And, Mr. Guster, I will carefully ponder my next move and your future with the company.
Let's talk, Burton.
Well, thank you for your time, Mr. Haversham.
I'm sorry you don't believe me.
But I do understand.
Can we speak privately?
Just one second.
What's your game?
I have two games, Red Rover and lawn darts.
We'd need at least four for even the most rudimentary game of Rover, and they don't make lawn darts anymore.
Too dangerous.
But that's not why I'm here.
I sensed several things in that house that I couldn't tell you with other people in the room.
This is getting desperate, Mr. Spencer, but, please, wow me.
You weren't raised by your father.
You were raised by your grandmother.
It was her ring.
Her ring that your wife wears now.
Okay, perhaps my father wasn't as present as I'd hoped and yes, my wife wears my grandmother's ring.
That doesn't mean anything.
Maybe not to you, but the sanctity of marriage means a lot to your grandmother, and having an affair with what?
A secretary?
That just feels wrong.
No matter how good her pappardelle is.
And just what the hell are you accusing me of?
You're getting hot chocolate on the floor.
Is this Bianca's pappardelle?
I hear voices.
Lady voices in the house.
No accusations here.
I'm just telling you your grandmother is very disappointed in you.
And she doesn't want you to go to jail.
Nothing you've accused me of is illegal.
He completely revamped our inventory system.
Repackaging samples and reselling them, while lucrative, is highly illegal.
So, what is this, now?
A shakedown?
There's no shakedown.
I'm just telling you what I know.
I'm a psychic, and with great power comes great responsibility.
And that responsibility, I share with Gus.
All we want is the opportunity to continue doing our work.
Just between us?
I'm a psychic.
I can't lie.
Mr. Guster, get back to work.
As per our conversation, your raise will be reflected in your next check.
I'm sorry, I'm confused.
Spend a little more time in your own business, Frankjim.
Excuse me.
I know about you, too.
His hair is horrible.
She who bore me.
What are you doing here, Goose?
Finished working on my case, and I had this amazing idea that I would come by and scoop you up and take you to a movie, and it would just be us.
Actually, your dad was planning on coming by.
Of course, he was.
Okay, I'll go.
Wait.
Enough.
What happened?
When?
Between you two.
Mom, that is a veritable lifetime of conversations.
Follow me.
No, Mom!
Mom, come on!
Oh, God!
Sit.
Are we really gonna do this?
Sit down.
Okay.
What happened?
Don't mince words.
With Dad?
Mom, we were both there, you know, we don't need to revisit the past.
Maybe we do.
Well, I'm not sure I wanna forgive him for what happened.
The divorce?
It wasn't what happened, Mom.
It was the way that it happened.
I mean, let's call it what it was.
He left us.
He left you.
He ended up with the house, and he left you by yourself to pick up the pieces.
That's not exactly what I call hero material, you know?
Shawn, I left him.
Come on, Mom.
You don't have to spin this for me, okay?
Let me be clear.
Your father was wonderful to me.
He wanted to keep going to counseling, he kept saying we could make it, but the writing was on the wall a long time.
You're losing me here, Mom.
What are you When I got that job, out of town, it was an incredible opportunity.
I was afraid I would never have a chance again, so I took it.
You were into your senior year.
Your path was set.
It seemed the right time, if such a thing is possible.
I thought, of all people, that you would be okay.
But I am so sorry.
Mom, you don't ever have to be sorry about anything.
Don't you spin this.
Sometimes, I get the worst realizations.
I know.
I know that I failed you, but I think that day, my life began again.
That sounds terrible, but don't you ever think I wanted to leave you.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 1}{START OF EPISODE 2}
Who put the orange slices in the punch bowl already?
They'll be soggy by the time everyone gets here.
This is a disaster, people!
Yep, first typhoid fever, now this.
Shawn, this night has been Everything has to go perfectly.
What I need from you is your support and your cooperation, not your sarcasm and mockery.
Okay, buddy, let me know when I can mock, 'cause I'm ready to mock.
Where is your grad pic?
Oh, yeah, I'm not gonna wear mine.
Shawn, come on, don't do this to me.
You know that was my thing.
Instead of nametags, we'll know who everyone is from their class picture.
Great idea, right?
Is it mock time, yet?
Just put it on, Shawn.
Okay, fine.
Excuse me.
There.
You happy now?
Shawn, that isn't you, is it?
No, it isn't.
It's Judd Nelson, isn't it?
Yes, it is.
And it's sweet, sweet nice.
Whoa, look who just rolled in.
Molly Ringwald and Andrew McCarthy.
Hey, Howie!
What's going down, boy?
From Fresh Horses.
That's Howie Tolkin.
He was our quarterback junior and senior year.
We had a football team?
Yes.
Tackle?
Seriously?
Who's the prom queen?
She's the prom queen, Eileen Mazwell.
You really don't remember any of this?
They're married now.
Dude, you didn't tell me Abigail Lytar was coming.
Oh, yeah.
I should I should say hello.
Abigail Lytar.
Judd Nelson?
In the flesh.
I loved you in, uh, From the Hip.
Thank you very much.
You know, there are those who believe I flared my nostrils too much in that film.
Oh, no.
I mean, how else could we possibly have known how angst-ridden you were?
I agree.
So.
Yeah, so Shawn!
Hello, Abigail.
Hi.
I need you to go to the cafeteria and grab another stack of folding chairs for me.
We're already short.
Consider it done.
One problem.
Where is the cafeteria?
Did you even attend this school?
Just grab the chairs.
I don't know where I'm going!
Maybe Abigail can help you.
I like that.
I like that very much.
You really don't remember what happened between us in high school, do you?
Stearns Wharf?
Senior year?
The carnival on the pier?
You pursued me, like, every day of senior year, and then I finally agreed to go out with you, and then you didn't show up.
I Uh, yeah, yes.
Here's the thing, Abigail, and not a lot of people know this, I was actually working as a midwife back then, family business, and I got a call from a client late at night, going into labor.
it was a lot of screaming, a fair amount of pushing, some dilation, tongs Oh, I can see where it wouldn't have occurred to you to call me.
But you know what?
It was 13 years ago, hardly matters now.
Exactly, is what I'm saying!
It was, like, forever ago!
We're adults now, doing adult things.
I mean, you're a teacher, that's fantastic.
What about you?
Or are you still in midwifery?
No, no.
I've dabbled in quite a few things, actually, but I landed quite nicely on psychic detective.
That's for real.
Who would actually choose to be a psychic?
First of all, it's a gift, it's not a choice.
I happen to be very, very good at it.
I solve crimes for the Santa Barbara Police Department.
It's kind of a big deal.
You solve crimes?
All the time.
Okay, well, you be sure to let me know if you sense that, you know, someone here at the reunion is gonna steal my lunch money.
That's very clever.
Did you see that?
What?
Is someone getting their lunch money stolen?
I think it's a little bit bigger than that.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Someone was murdered here.
I am absolutely 100% certain that I sensed a body drop here.
Right here.
I don't know who, but I I could see he was wearing a letterman's jacket of some sort.
Are you doing this to me on purpose?
Are you fabricating some kind of foul play just to mess up the night for me?
Yes, I am.
I killed someone here at our high school reunion just to foil your of best pep rally moments.
Do you even know what a pep captain is, Shawn?
Yeah, he's a male cheerleader, I believe.
It's a leader among men, Shawn!
A leader among men!
Who cheers.
I saw Bring It On.
Oh, wait.
I get it.
You guys are dating?
You're together?
Everything makes sense.
We are not dating.
Are you kidding me?
He was voted "Most Likely to Succeed.
" Think he's gonna date me?
No body, no crime, Shawn.
Gus, buddy No body, no crime!
Gus!
No body, no crime!
He's just gonna keep saying that, isn't he?
I believe so, yes.
But You don't believe me either?
No body, no crime, Shawn.
But, Abigail!
Hello?
Hey, hi!
Henry?
Yes.
Yes.
It's me, Henry, your ex-husband.
Look, I don't want to bother you, but, uh How you doing?
Great.
And you?
Great.
Doing great.
Well, there's that.
Hey, Madeleine, listen.
Uh, I'm just about to cook up a steak here, and I've got another one sitting right next to it.
I was just thinking, you know, if you're hungry, you could, uh Would you Or not.
I, uh Honestly, I would love to taste one of your steaks, but I just had a delicious salad from room service.
Oh!
Okay, hey, no biggie, I, you know Of course, I just, uh, was concerned that you hadn't eaten.
And now that I know you had a salad, I feel better and, uh Ba-ba-boom!
Okay, have a good night.
You too.
Okay, bye.
Ba-ba-boom?
Okay, dude.
I think I'm on to something.
Now, true, there may not be an actual body, but I am telling you that a very real crime was committed here, and there is very real evidence.
I would like to see some evidence of some folding chairs, Shawn.
If you're not gonna take this seriously, then I will pull out this phone and I will call Lassiter.
Hey.
Could you start distributing these ballots for the reunion king and queen to everybody?
Dialing, connecting.
Ringing!
Lassiter?
What are you doing at our reunion?
First off, of course it had to be yours, 'cause that's my luck.
And secondly, I'm on a date.
Well, we're on a case and you're on it with us.
Not tonight, I'm not.
On a date?
With a person?
Yes, with a person.
Blonde, yellow dress.
Mindy Howland?
Mm-hmm.
Isn't that the girl who stuffed Bobby Cobetts in his own car trunk when he wouldn't kiss her at the Spring Fling?
We met at the Santa Barbara Bowl at the Ravi Shankar concert last week and she asked me out on a date.
Who goes to someone else's reunion when they barely even know them?
Who goes to a Ravi Shankar concert?
Hey, look, I didn't realize it was a reunion till I showed up.
And we have a very deep connection.
The same connection you have with the sitar?
Where's my punch, Corey?
Yeah, where's her punch, Corey?
Hello, Mindy.
You look nice.
Oh, give it up, Button-up.
I already have a date to this thing.
Mindy, it's official.
You've won "Bitchiest Banana.
" And now, I am going to borrow Detective Lassiter for as long as I'd like.
Detective Wait, he's a cop?
All right, I have to be discreet.
Gus has a very weak constitution for these sort of things.
I witnessed a murder here tonight.
What?
Who?
I'm not entirely sure.
What did you see?
I didn't actually see anything.
I psychically witnessed it with my third eye.
Where's the body?
There's not one.
Listen up, let me impart to you a little police wisdom we like to throw around down at the station.
No body, no crime.
What, you guys put that on a t-shirt?
Fine.
Who did it?
And why?
I don't know.
But, I don't know.
Do you have a murder weapon?
Nope.
Well then, good night, Spencer.
Gus, this so-called football team of ours, were we any good?
Yes, we won State Champ our senior year!
Seriously, you didn't go to any of the games?
The games were on Fridays.
That would mean missing Step by Step.
But this winning state, would that get you some sort of special pin?
Yes, Shawn.
The State Champs pin.
I got it.
Lassy, I know who the murder victim is.
Who?
Class of '95, Sabercats' starting quarterback, Howie Tolkin!
Shawn?
What?
Howie.
Hold that thought.
Look, Jules, just get down here as fast as you can.
I really need your help on this case.
It's intense!
Well, I will fill you in on the rest when you get here.
Thank you.
So, Carl, this is my ex-boyfriend from high school, all four years, Eldon.
Nice to meet you, buddy.
Yeah.
Right.
And this is his, uh, his brand new wife, Stephanie.
So, I'm dating a cop now.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
You ever shoot anybody?
Well, I Of course he has.
Probably a bunch of people.
A bunch?
I mean, you know, what is a bunch, really?
I Yes.
Women.
Absolutely nothing but heartache, man.
All they want is the ring, man.
They won't stop till they get the ring.
Dude, I could not have said it better myself.
Maybe clearer.
But I agree.
I'm just like you guys.
I hope to kiss one, someday.
Exactly.
You know, dude, you're just like us, marginally employed, single, never been married.
I mean, you get it.
Did you guys see someone tampering with this case?
No, but I wish I had thought of that.
I would love to see that Tolkin guy go down.
He terrorized me in high school.
They build a shrine for him because he can throw a football?
Who cares?
Exactly.
Hey!
Why don't they build a shrine to my butt?
There you are.
I've been looking all over for you.
Dude, you totally lied to us.
You have a girl and she is hot.
Excuse us, dudes.
Okay.
What are you wearing?
What?
You said you were on a case and that there were possible criminal suspects down here that might get spooked by cops snooping around.
Yeah, but what are you wearing?
This is a reunion, not the prom.
I need you to fit in.
What?
This?
This isn't a prom dress.
It looks like a prom dress.
It's a little poofy.
It doesn't poof.
There's no poof.
There's slight poof.
Look, it's what I was gonna wear to my high school reunion that I couldn't go to because I was on a case.
Jules Just show me where these suspects are that I need to vet?
I don't know if you need to vet anything.
The animals are fine.
But let's poof on over and I'll point them out to you.
Oh, thanks for playing up that whole tough guy cop thing, you know, with Eldon.
That was really nice of you.
I think the "I'm packing heat" thing was a little overboard, but he seemed to buy it, so But I am packing heat.
Oh, that's cute.
What, do you squeeze the trigger and a little pen comes out so you can write people parking tickets?
Um, Barnaby Jones, why don't you hold my purse while I go dance?
I called you because I need your help Oh, my God!
It's Howie and Eileen!
Abe Frohman, Sausage King of Chicago.
Yes!
We all spent our wonder years together.
Right.
You guys look great.
Especially you.
I want you back in clean up, if you catch my meaning!
Look at that package, huh?
Look, I I don't mean to be a downer, guys, but did you know that somebody tampered with your football shrine?
Ah!
Dude, seriously, that's just old high school stuff.
I don't even think about that anymore.
I'm actually onto much bigger stuff now, so Howie just announced his candidacy for State Assembly last month.
Yeah, dude, I care about the issues.
I actually think I can make a difference.
Isn't that right, babe?
That's right, baby.
See, after I fix the state of California, I'm going to write a motivational book for losers who need help.
And the working title right now is Move It or Move It!
Wow, that is so much stuff!
Wow, yeah.
When will you find time to tape Larry Lester's butt cheeks together?
Never saw Breakfast Club?
Either of you?
Wow.
Okay, baby, Howie wants one of those little mini quesadillas.
Let's get after it.
Who hasn't seen The Breakfast Club?
Um You honestly don't think there's anything suspicious about those two?
I'm not sure.
I mean, for a guy who's clearly stuck in the past, he seemed to brush off the whole vandalism of his trophy case thing pretty easily.
I could dust the case for prints, but that's it.
Jules, anyone who enters or exits this place is a suspect.
If this thing ends before I solved the homicide, you can kiss the murderer goodbye.
Gus, thank goodness.
I need to get to the roof, I need to get into the library, I need to psychically remember everything about high school.
That stuff is locked up tight.
This place is like Fort Knox tonight.
Fine.
Where is the gymnasium?
We're in the gymnasium, Shawn.
Wow, buddy, you did a really nice job.
Hey, Shawn, what's up?
Listen, Dad.
Remember that box of my old high school stuff that Mom put away for me?
There's It was just a It was a box of stuff.
What box?
The box.
What box, Shawn?
What am I thinking?
Mom's in town.
Do me a favor.
Call her and find out where she put it.
I can't.
I can't.
What do you mean, you can't?
I can't.
I just talked to her, Shawn, and I think she thought I mean supposedly She had a salad.
Who am I to think that she didn't have a salad?
I just Dad, I need this box!
I'm on a case, okay?
Just call her, locate the box.
I will come get it from you.
Fine.
It's Ah, I don't I just don't see it.
You're not looking.
There's so much stuff.
What is all this crap?
It's your life.
No, these boxes are not my life.
Well, it's stuff from your life, anyway.
I boxed it all up 'cause I thought maybe someday you'd want to look at it again, when you're old and crotchety.
Yeah, well, I just want to dump it all!
Which, in your case, would be today.
Look at this!
Look at that!
What is it?
It's a matchbox car.
It's Shawn's first one.
I bought it for him when I brought him home, remember?
I do.
He never even played with it.
Henry, you bought him a squad car.
Kids love police cars.
But they're all police cars, all 20 of them.
No, no, no, they're all different.
You see that one there, that's a squad car.
This one here, see that?
It's a paddy wagon.
A prison transport vehicle, that's an old one.
Oh, look at that!
A crowd control van.
Look at it, it even has the tiny water cannons up on top.
Here's the box he wanted.
Wow!
You know, I thought you would've become, like, a doctor or something like that.
Well, what I do is pretty fascinating.
Really?
How so?
Well, with my specialty, which is mucus reducers, I use a mixture of, uh Did I also tell you that I have a side psychic detective business that I started with my buddy?
Really?
Yeah.
And I may or may not have tracked down a counterfeiter, unveiled a nanny ring, saved the show American Duos, stuff like that.
That was you?
I remember that!
So, I'm kind of working on a case right now.
Really?
God, that's hot.
Hi!
What are you guys doing here?
Whoa!
Slow down.
We brought you the box you were bitching about.
No.
No, no, Dad.
I asked you to locate the box so that I could come pick it up from you, not to drag Mom down to my high school reunion!
Lighten up, honey.
What are you so worried about?
It's not like I'm gonna pull out a Kleenex, wet it and wipe the corners of your mouth.
Look, it's Gus!
I have to say hello.
No, Mom!
There aren't really any other parents here.
Awesome.
What exactly are you up to?
All right, look, Shawn, I went to this school too, so it was my school long before it was yours.
Okay, fine, you win "Oldest Student Here" award.
Now, will you please leave?
I'm sure the nondescript blazer rental place is about to close.
Hey, hey, cutie patootie!
Look, seriously, my name is Carlton, okay?
How hard is that to remember?
Carl-ton.
Carl-ton.
Yeah, I know your name, silly.
I just think a better name for you is Cutie Patootie, you know, because you have such a cutie patootie.
Hey there.
Exactly how much of that punch have you had?
Just enough to realize, you know, that I might've been a little short with you before, and, I'm very sorry.
Can you forgive me?
Hmm?
Maybe.
Yeah?
Yeah?
Good, 'cause I I have just one teensy weensy little tiny favor to ask of you.
What's that?
I need you to make a move on Eldon's wife, Stephanie, 'cause I want that painted whore out of the picture.
Okay?
Can you do that for me?
No!
No, I cannot do that for you!
Fine, you suck!
What?
Hey, your purse!
Ah, crap.
Great.
Well, that figures.
What are those?
Just a copy of every key in the school.
By the end of senior year, I had managed to become a member of the Trans-American Western Custodial Union.
Local 456.
Don't hold me to this, but I believe I still have voting privileges.
Ah, it's been 35 years since I've wandered these halls.
I think I'm gonna take a look around.
You want to join me?
That depends.
Do you have a hall pass?
You kidding?
I used to own these halls.
Did you bring me a glass of punch as some sort of Oh, no.
Sorry, these are both for me, actually.
I can grab you one though, if you like.
No.
I do have a question for you, though.
Hmm.
Assuming that Parker Stevenson had never been born Have you ever seen a very attractive man solve a crime before?
I did see John Cusack prevent a jaywalking once.
This is good.
Yeah.
Just give me a minute.
I'm gonna have to do my thing, okay?
You might want to steady or brace yourself.
Why?
What's gonna happen?
Well, I can't really say with any degree of accuracy, but I can tell you that some animals, slow adults and beautiful girls have been known to swoon.
You just called me slow.
Excuse me.
Are you okay?
I'm a slave to it.
Wait for it.
Wait for it Don't do that.
Don't mock the spirit world.
It's beneath you.
Have you ever wondered why you haven't been married yet?
I don't have to wonder.
I know why.
Well, why?
I will get married some day.
I just haven't met him yet.
You don't think?
What about you?
What about me?
Abigail, lots of strapping, brilliant type guys never got married.
Ludwig van Beethoven.
Sir Isaac Newton, right?
Doing his thing.
Jon Lovitz Jon Lovitz's brother Jon Lovitz has a brother?
Does it really matter?
I just figured it out.
What?
Why you never got married?
No, I know who our murderers are.
So wait, now you are saying that Howie and Eileen are the killers?
Yup.
Wasn't Howie the victim at one point?
Gus, that is so I bet you're still telling your friends to "chillax.
" Shawn, why would two people who just killed someone be so casual, smiling, dancing?
I agree.
It is both surreal and disturbing to watch two murderers do the cabbage patch.
That's the point, Gus.
They're trying to look as casual as possible.
But I'm not fooled.
The question is why are they sticking around?
We're looking for info on our beloved couple.
Anything that might say future killers.
What does that word even mean anyway?
Greatness.
It's like they purposely set you up for failure.
I mean, what have I done in my life that anyone would say was great?
Dude, the perfect cocoa roundness of your head alone makes you great.
That's easy for you to say, Shawn.
Nobody had any expectations you would amount to greatness.
Gus, don't be an incorrigible Eskimo Pie with a caramel ribbon.
It doesn't matter what these people think of you but, and I put this out there as a challenge to you, you really want to show them you've lived up to your potential?
Help me solve this case, please.
Come on!
How many of our classmates are out there solving a murder tonight?
Huh?
A handful, maybe?
You could be one of them.
Duckie.
What?
Dude, we've been looking in the wrong John Hughes movie.
This isn't Breakfast Club, or Curly Sue or Mr. Mom.
And it certainly isn't Flubber.
Why are you hating on Flubber?
I would never hate on Flubber.
I'm not following.
What do all the best John Hughes movies have in common?
A love triangle.
There's always a Duckie.
Do you recognize that guy?
Vaguely.
I don't know his name though.
Check the grad pics.
He didn't show up.
Seventeen no-shows.
He's one of them.
But the question is, which one?
Duckie, where are you?
Is this the same guy?
Good work, Gus.
This is good.
I think I just figured something out.
I gotta make a quick stop.
Are we back in business, partner?
Milo and Otis.
I get to be Otis?
That's a given.
Okay.
Look, but I have to get back to the gym and make sure all the ballots are in or we won't have a reunion king and queen.
Meet you there?
Yeah.
Or, we could meet back here and give each other makeovers to Karla DeVito's We Are Not Alone.
It's your choice.
Dad?
What are you doing here?
How did How did you even get in here?
Place was open.
Your mom and I were just looking around.
She's in the bathroom.
So what, you just You just thought it was a normal thing to sit here in the dark?
Shawn, I used to fix up cars in this very place when I was in high school.
I actually dropped the tranny out of a '57 Chevy just like this one, practically rebuilt the thing from scratch.
When that thing was done, baby, I tell you, it purred.
Well, now I feel awful.
Why?
Mom.
She's still in the bathroom.
She missed that entire story.
Shawn, it's not my fault that you never cared about anything in high school.
Yeah, well, as it turns out, it seems I did care about something.
I guess it doesn't matter much anymore.
Dad, do you think you can miss out on a moment?
What do you mean?
Like, an opportunity.
You think you can miss an opportunity in a moment, you know, and then it's too late, and the course of your life is changed forever?
Yeah.
Absolutely.
Wait a minute.
Is this about a girl?
Maybe.
Life is not made up of a single moment.
It's made up of a gazillion moments.
What defines us is the choice we make in the next moment and the one after that.
These moments, Shawn, they're happening.
They're all around us, all the time.
You're having one right now.
I just keep wondering, like, what if I had made a different choice, you know, like on a particular night in one of these moments, who would I be now?
Well, I suspect that you wouldn't be you.
Good talk, Dad.
I gotta run.
Actually, there is one more thing.
Do you think I can borrow your underpants?
Just for, like, 10 minutes?
Oh, come on!
We're already in the car!
These are These are iconic film references I'm making tonight.
His name is Peter Colter.
Class of '95.
Can we hurry this up?
I'm due back in the gym to make my presentation.
If Chief Vick knew I was running names for you guys, I'd lose my ass.
We definitely don't want that to happen.
Oh, wait!
I have something.
What is it?
Well, it's not criminal, but it's an accident report.
There was an accident on June 6, 1995.
That was three days before graduation.
Peter Colter was the driver.
Alcohol was involved.
He hit another vehicle head on.
A man was thrown from the car 20 feet, he was rushed to the hospital, survived in a coma for seven months and eventually died from internal injuries.
Peter Colter was then charged with involuntary manslaughter and received six years probation.
But there were two other passengers in the car with him.
Let me guess.
Howie Tolkin and Eileen Mazwell?
Yeah.
How'd you know that?
Because I've seen Pretty in Pink like 75 times.
Wait, wait.
And here's something else.
Well, it's small, but some petty theft that was out of state, a shoplifting in Fallon, Nevada, which leads me to a restraining order.
It was placed one month ago by Eileen Mazwell on Peter Colter.
For what?
Harassment.
Peter wasn't driving the car that night.
It was Howie.
What?
And he took the rap for the accident?
Why?
A moment and a choice, Gus.
Look, Howie and Eileen killed Peter.
I know it all now.
But no body, no crime.
Seriously, Jules?
That has to be on a poster around here somewhere.
It's just something we say.
Wait, so we know who the killers are and we know who they killed, but we don't have a body?
Where is it?
Well, if I was just some average guy without any super powers I'd say, "I don't know, why are you asking me"?
But as head psychic of the Santa Barbara Police Department, I'd say, "I don't know, why are you asking me"?
Shawn?
It's still hidden somewhere at that school!
O'Hara, what are you doing here this late?
I thought you were off tonight.
Yeah.
You know, I was out.
Stopped back by.
I, you know, forgot my Chapstick, which I now have.
Yay!
Where were you at?
Your prom?
Why would you say that?
Because you're wearing a prom dress.
And are you two on a case?
Chief.
Because I don't remember assigning you one.
What are you looking at?
She was helping me.
I just made a bust.
Oh, and who was that?
That is a real schizoid.
Elizabeth Reba Davis, AKA Mindy Howland, who has been filling false prescriptions under fake names since '96.
Oh, okay.
I see.
Well, good work, people.
Oh, and by the way, whatever it is you're really working on, you're not being paid for this.
Thank you for that, Lassiter.
Yeah, sweet.
Look, if you don't mind, I'm gonna get back to this.
I don't want to miss the mug shots.
I'm having fun.
It's the best date I've been on in a long time.
He landed here.
We know that.
There's no other entrance they could have gotten into unless they dragged the body 200 yards all the way back to the gym.
Right.
Wait a minute.
That is the girls' locker room.
Oh, now that he remembers.
How would they even get a body down there, anyway?
It's like a 13-foot drop.
There's only one way to find out, partner.
I'm gonna ease you down and I'll be right behind you.
You must be out of your damn mind, Shawn.
I'm not going down there first!
Are you kidding me?
You're gonna do this to me now, after I've laid all the groundwork?
Now, would you just get down there?
I don't want to do it.
Help me back up.
What do you mean?
You're in.
Help me up, Shawn!
All right.
Okay, now you, Shawn.
Shawn?
Dude, I am so sorry.
I didn't realize I had the keys all along.
Let's just get to it.
Okay, indeed.
Let's find us a body.
But first, let's both of us take a private moment to pay homage to all of the wonderful things that have occurred here over the years.
Dude, it's Howie and Eileen.
That's why they haven't left the reunion.
They stashed the body but now they've gotta move it.
Yeah, but where is it?
Did you hear that?
I think there's someone in here with us.
I think it came from the stalls.
Nobody's there.
Check the lockers.
Do you have a stick or a small leaf?
Why would I have a stick?
Okay.
We gotta get this body to Lassiter if I'm going to accuse them of the crime.
Why don't we bring Lassiter down here?
And we come back, and the body is gone again?
Come on!
If Tolkin finds us, he's gonna strangle us!
He strangles people, Shawn.
Head or feet?
Shawn.
Shawn Spencer.
Were you girls able to get some punch?
What are you doing tomorrow?
Flying to San Francisco for work.
You know I'm just here for a little while.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, of course, I just, I Actually, I thought you might want to see my elementary school.
You did?
Yeah!
Sure, this is This is only half the picture.
Yeah!
That was fun, right?
So, it is now time to announce the reunion prom queen and king!
Howie Tolkin!
And his real life bride, Eileen Mazwell!
Where you going?
Howie!
Eileen!
Come up here!
This is exciting!
Congratulations.
Looks like history has repeated itself.
Those crowns sure are heavy.
Yes, they are.
Heavy with lies.
You see, my fellow alumni, one of your classmates was murdered here tonight.
His name was Peter Colter.
Smart kid, he was a whiz at fixing cars.
He was also the water boy for the football team.
The reason you probably don't remember him very well is because he lived in their shadow.
He worshipped them.
He'd do anything for them.
Including taking a rap for a tragic car accident that was actually caused by Howie.
And you let him do it because you didn't want to lose your precious scholarship.
Poor Peter's life was stuck in that moment and he never recovered.
That's why he didn't show up to take his yearbook photo and that's why he moved away and ended up committing petty crimes.
Meanwhile, the two of you moved on to UCLA.
You married your prom queen.
Probably never gave your old friend Peter another thought.
That is, until about a month ago.
Isn't that right, Eileen?
See, it's no coincidence that the restraining order you filed against Peter just happened to coincide with Howie here announcing his candidacy in the State Assembly.
Peter couldn't take it anymore.
He needed the truth to come out, so he contacted you.
You two did everything you could to prevent him from coming here tonight, but he came anyway.
He wore his letterman's jacket with his special State Championship pin, still stuck in that one moment.
He visited all his old haunts, made a stop at the auto shop.
He got a little upset when he saw the trophy shrine built to celebrate you.
Finally, he confronted you both on the roof, drunk and upset.
But you couldn't let him uncover the truth.
There was way too much to lose.
So you gave him one final push.
Silenced him once and for all.
Three arrests in one night.
Not bad.
Please tell me you have the body.
It's the furry sabercat backstage.
Great.
Homicide Howie, ladies and gentlemen.
And now, I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank someone who is not only responsible for planning all of this tonight, complete with a Rastafarian theme that you all embraced so heartily, but who is also the mastermind behind solving tonight's crime.
I know, it's true, I'm the psychic, but oftentimes, my revelations are nothing but cryptic mess.
Tonight, for instance, all I could see was scenes from Pretty in Pink, a giant rhombus, and a t-shirt that read "Soccer Moms are Easy.
" Now, I don't know what these things mean, but Gus is somehow able to shape them into cold, hard evidential facts.
But that is not what makes him great.
No, sir.
Burton Guster has been my best friend since we were five.
And maybe, just maybe, if any of you can look yourselves in the mirror and know that you've been half as good a friend to someone else as Gus has been to me, well, you too can be considered great.
Give it up for my best friend, Burton Guster.
Oh, Henry, we must've done something well.
That was all you.
You know that's not true.
I must say, that was quite impressive.
If you're that good of a detective, I can only imagine what sort of midwife you made.
Okay, this is 13 years overdue, but here goes.
I know that you think that I didn't show up the night I was supposed to meet you at the carnival, but the truth is, I did.
You were standing at the end of the pier.
You were wearing a blue thin-striped baby doll dress, Doc Marten sandals, black.
You had a row of red butterfly clips in your hair.
Short jean jacket, and the right pocket was ripped because you always used to shove your fist in there when you got nervous.
You were pacing back and forth that night.
You waited around almost an hour before you walked away.
These are our tickets to the carnival.
I saved them.
I was so nervous, I choked.
And you know what?
That hardly ever happens to me.
But the truth is, Abigail, I think I liked you too much.
And somewhere, in the back of my head, I knew what that night would mean and even how my life could be different now if I hadn't let you walk away.
But this is a different moment, and it's a chance to make a different choice.
And you're really amazing.
And I know we can't go back in time, but I do wish that there was some way back So I'll just keep thinking and if there's anything that comes to mind, I'll let you know.
That was really nice.
Pretty much perfect.
Yeah.
Pretty much perfect So, where do we go from here?
I don't know.
Maybe this is what closure feels like?
Maybe.
I guess I'll see you at the 20 year reunion?
Yeah, uh Well, knowing Gus, it'll probably be our 23rd.
But I'll see you there.
Yeah.
Sure.
Okay.
Bye, Shawn.
Dear Leland Bosseigh High Administrative Board.
We accept that you are withholding our deposit of $1,500 for damages.
We also accept that you just see us as you want to see us, in the simplest terms, in the most convenient definitions.
A snarky psychic, an uptight pharmaceutical salesman, a pretty female blonde detective and a not so pretty, unusually lanky detective.
But each of us is all of those things.
Plus, our normal fee for solving a murder in one meaningful evening is twice that.
So enclosed is a bill for $3,000.
Please remit payment in the form of a check made out simply to Psych.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 2}{START OF EPISODE 3}
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn, this'll never work.
I've done the math.
The ramp's too short!
You'll have to let me duck.
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shawn, stop!
Abort!
Abort!
Abort!
Oh, crap!
What in the hell do you think you're doing, Shawn?
Dad, you ruined everything!
Of all the boneheaded stunts you've pulled in your life, this is without a doubt, the dumbest!
Shawn, what in the name of everything that's holy would possess you to do something so incredibly stupid?
All the kids from my class wanted to see me do it.
See?
No.
See what, Shawn?
Come here.
Listen to me.
You think your fans came out here to see you make this jump?
Yeah.
They came out here, to see you crack your head open.
Which basically makes you no different than the kid in class who can shoot milk out of his eye.
Do you think I could be as popular as him?
I can't believe you did this, Shawn.
Apparently, you're unaware that some churros have more nutrients than carrots.
have my RDA of riboflavin.
No, I mean, accepting tickets to some ridiculous tractor pull as payment for a case.
Gus, excuse us, when your clients are carnie folk, it's this or twenty rides on a rusty Tilt-A-Whirl.
And I remember the last time you got on one of those.
You know I had early onset vertigo.
The important thing is that Wolfboy and his gold teeth have been reunited.
Ow!
Ow!
Don't play, Shawn.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Please give a huge Santa Barbara welcome to our opening act.
Put your hands together for the heart-stopping, gravity-mystifying, death-defying, Dutch the Clutch Jenkins!
I can't believe it, dude.
It's Dutch the Clutch.
What?
You know that guy?
Dude, you don't remember Dutch the Clutch?
He was on That's Incredible, once when we were kids.
And he jumped Springfield Gorge.
That was Homer Simpson.
Dutch will attempt to launch himself through the ring of fire, and land safely on the other side.
But, for the first time ever, Dutch will attempt this stunt without the benefit of his sight!
That guy is crazy.
Crazy awesome.
Here we go, folks!
Hold on to your seats!
We need a medic!
Everyone, please remain calm!
He's okay!
Everyone, show your appreciation for a true American hero, Dutch the Clutch Jenkins!
That was insane.
No, that was attempted murder.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Dutch!
Dutch the Clutch.
You honestly don't remember him?
No, why is this such a big deal for you?
Gus, guys like me and him are cut from the same cloth, okay?
We cast aside the rules of society.
We laugh in the face of danger.
We ignore the tiny voice in our head that tells us not to do stuff.
The tiny voice in my head says, "There's a reason I'm the only black person here.
" I'm telling you, man, someone tried to kill him.
Take it from a fellow motorcycle guy.
Please, what was the last repair you did to your bike?
Can you get that?
Does adding a sticker count?
Regardless, fuel lines do not randomly spring leaks.
There's a killer out there, and he or she failed.
So they're bound to try again.
How the hell are we supposed to protect someone who straps himself to a rocket-powered bike and sails through a wall of fire?
I'm working on it.
Can I help you?
Yes.
I'm Shawn Spencer, police psychic, amateur daredevil, denture wearer and strawberry crepe enthusiast.
You're not on the list.
List?
Dude, they're about to start racing ocelots in half an hour.
There's no way you have a velvet rope here.
Let's go, Shawn.
No, no, no.
I'm here to tell you that something was off with Dutch's last stunt.
He is in danger and I sense foul play.
It's both a daredevil and a psychic thing.
You'll just have to trust me.
Sir, I want you to turn around and get the hell out of Hey!
Give me a sec with these guys, yeah?
I'm Lewis.
Dutch is my dad.
Ah!
So, uh, what the hell do you mean by foul play?
We're private investigators.
He's a psychic.
He left out the daredevil part.
And that's why he knows the stunt was tampered with.
A psychic, huh?
I don't know about that sort of thing, but, uh, you might be on to something.
My dad's last two stunts didn't go off right, either.
And I have been noticing some weird things lately.
Well, you're lucky.
We're in the business of weird.
What would you need for me to hire you?
A retainer check for $2,000.
Dutch's autograph.
Man, I will punch you in the knee.
Go ahead.
I dare Look, guys, money's a little tight right now.
Last month we shared the bill with Yippy, the hiccupping terrier.
He's still hiccupping?
Dude, you know that, but you don't know who Dutch the Clutch is?
He's been hiccupping for nine years, Shawn.
It's a canine record.
Hey!
Guys, please.
Look, no offense, but my dad's not gonna let some psychic guy hang around him.
His circle's airtight.
But we'll work something out.
Come on.
There's an after party.
Let's go.
Okay.
Thanks.
You ready?
Interrogation Room A. Great.
So?
So, what?
Your date, Friday night?
Details.
What happened?
Well, we ordered the crab cakes.
Mmm.
And she went to the bathroom and didn't come back.
So either it went badly or she's still in the bathroom.
Oh, Carlton, I'm sorry.
Hmm.
You told the dead clown story, didn't you?
What?
That is a funny story.
Clowns are funny.
Stories about them being shot to death, not so much.
Please tell me you didn't draw a diagram of the bullet holes?
Well, there were crayons on the table.
What was I supposed to do?
You took her to a restaurant that had crayons on the table?
Thank you for your concern.
I am fine.
Interrogation Room A, right?
Yes.
What do I sound like?
An agent in the valley?
This is Dutch the Clutch!
What are you, deaf?
He doesn't get out of bed for less than two grand!
3500.
That's it.
Wow.
You know, The Allman Brothers generally tend to inhibit my psychic powers.
So, why don't you just tell me, is there anyone that'd like to see your dad bite the bullet?
Just about everybody that comes to the show.
Anyone in here, in particular, have a grudge with him?
Against my dad?
Yeah.
No way.
Everybody here loves him.
I can't understand why anyone would wanna hurt him.
In fact, I've been trying to get him to retire altogether.
Why doesn't he listen?
Give up the spotlight?
Give up the applause?
The love?
Never.
Besides, well Oh, no.
my dad thinks he's unkillable.
But he's wrong.
He's flesh and blood.
My flesh and blood.
That's why I'm counting on you boys.
Okay, um, let me introduce you to my dad.
Do we have our cover stories, yet?
Oh, don't worry.
I take care of all the finances and hirings.
Pop, I found us the two new Die Hards you asked for.
Damn.
Already?
Actually, I'm Die Hard.
He's Die Harder.
We have two other guys in our crew but they aren't nearly as good as us.
Well, how in the hell did you do that so quick, especially after what happened to that last bunch?
Excuse me.
What happened to the last bunch?
Well, we can't talk about it for legal reasons.
All I know is our attorney said that it ain't decapitation if the head don't come off all the way.
I joke.
I joke.
That's morbid!
Hi, I'm Viki.
Dutch's wife.
Now, you boys have experience, right?
It's up to you to keep my man safe.
That's right.
Hey, what's the most dangerous thing you boys done?
We eat at Taco John's with some frequency.
So that puts us right there on the edge.
Oh, we got ourselves a couple of comedians.
I like that!
Okay, you boys got the job!
Goddamn!
Oh.
Did you just break your wrist?
Yeah, well, it's okay.
Nothing busted through the skin.
Dad, maybe you should take a break.
I mean, you almost got killed today.
Oh, come on, son.
You just worry about your own safety.
I'll be fine.
Well, maybe Lewis is right.
And we can finally take that vacation to Dollywood.
Uh, not to overstep, but I think you may still have a concussion from earlier.
Concussion?
Hell, I've had a concussion since 1982.
True story.
Anybody else's beer taste like metal?
Sunday, Sunday, Sunday!
Who the hell put that on there?
Okay.
Did we miss something?
Hell.
That's El Diablo.
What is an El Diablo?
He's nobody.
Just some wannabe daredevil.
No one knows who he is 'cause he always wears a mask.
Right there.
See that, right there?
That's why we can't take no damn vacation.
That son of a bitch is right on my heels.
Relax, Dad.
He's amateur hour compared to you.
Dutch!
Forget about El Diablo.
I got you that canyon jump in September!
Rock on, Manny!
Oh.
Oh.
I told you, Clutch.
Explosions.
Crashes.
That's what people pay to see.
You keep that up, I'm gonna get you on TV.
And it won't be that infomercial for the home stomach pump.
This is gonna be one of those rain delay filler shows.
Dad, please.
It's too soon to be adding new stunts.
Oh, piss!
Ain't nobody telling me I can't do anything no more!
I think that was the worst English I've ever heard.
All right!
$200 and I'm gonna take a fall!
Fifty?
Glen Campbell rocks!
Oh, damn!
I spilled my beer.
It might be harder to keep this guy alive than I thought.
You need me, Chief?
Why is someone lodging a complaint against my head detective?
Yeah, that's the third one this month.
He's just going through a rough patch right now.
He'll be fine.
I think he's having some serious dating problems.
Oh.
You know, when I used to work vice, my partner was an alcoholic.
And one night I went over to his house, handcuffed him to a radiator and made him dry out.
When he finally sobered up, I gave him a choice.
Go into department rehab program or chew your hand off for freedom.
He chose the program.
Is that a real story?
Maybe it is.
Maybe I saw it on an old Police Woman rerun.
The point is, O'Hara, sometimes it's up to the cop's partner to keep their head above water, huh?
To do what's necessary to make sure that they stay on course.
Get me?
Yes, Chief.
This is for you.
What's wrong?
The Chief just gave me some really weird advice.
Oh, what does she want?
Well, I can't be sure, but I think she wants me to find Lassiter a girlfriend.
Good luck with that.
That makes sense, I guess.
Thanks, Lewis.
So Dutch doesn't have a will because, apparently, invincible people do not need them.
Hmm.
What is all this?
Those are forms that must be filled out, so that we can be Die Hards.
Just sign them.
These release the employer from any liability in case the stunt tester is torn to shreds?
Stunt tester?
Is that what we're doing?
Are you crazy?
Trust me and be cool.
Wait.
This one is in case we're accidentally chewed to death by a malfunctioning robot?
Oh, hell, no!
Relax.
We'll be fine.
Deboned?
Killed and rekilled?
How does that even work?
Gus, don't be an old sponge with hair hanging off of it.
I'm all over this case.
Mimed to death?
That's clearly a typo.
They meant "maimed.
" What, are we gonna be killed by Marcel Marceau?
Marcel Marceau is dead.
See?
There's nothing to worry about.
We are solving this case, Shawn, before we have to do any of this stuff.
Fair.
I've been checking out this El Diablo guy.
He always rolls into town the day after Dutch.
And they've been competing for the same gigs for almost a year.
Including that canyon jump that Dutch just got.
All right.
Motive.
Wipe out Dutch and the field is clear.
And El Diablo is a daredevil so he would know how to sabotage the stunts to make it look like an accident.
I'll buy that.
And someone at the party told me that El Diablo performed at the fair the night before Dutch, when Dutch's team was, no doubt, prepping for their stunt.
You're saying they had access to Dutch's equipment?
I'm sold.
He's our guy.
So where is he?
Where do we find this El Diablo?
How do you feel about checking out some old, antique motorcycles?
They call this a motorcycle show?
There's like, four motorcycles here.
They don't even have the bike from Blue Thunder.
That was a helicopter.
You're right.
I was thinking of Blue Lagoon.
There was no bike in Blue Lagoon.
How did they get off the island, Gus?
Oh, man.
All right, thanks a lot.
Yo.
El Diablo!
What's up, man?
Shawn Spencer, this is my partner, Squirts Macintosh.
We just have a couple, sort of, serious questions for you.
Oh, no, no, no.
You don't have to get on the bike!
Dude, he's running!
International sign of guilt.
Let's go!
Quick!
Get in the sidecar.
Are you out of your damn mind?
I'm not getting in that thing.
You get in there.
Gus, you have absolutely no idea how to drive a motorcycle.
Get in the sidecar.
Dude, it's like High Road to China!
What are you doing?
We're going.
We're going!
Lewis?
You're El Diablo?
Lewis?
That is the sexiest thing I've ever seen.
Shut up, Shawn.
You're guilty of attempted patricide.
And you tried to kill your own dad.
I never tried to kill anyone.
You really think I'd hire detectives if I wanted to bump off my own dad?
What kind of psychic are you?
The kind that loves bees.
And historical novels.
The kind that knows a lie when he hears one.
And knows that only the guilty make a run for it.
The only thing I am guilty of is not telling my dad that I do this, too.
And I ran because I don't want you two exposing my secret.
Why hide it?
My dad forbid me from being a daredevil because he didn't want me to get hurt.
Do you know what it's like to have your father tell you not to follow in his footsteps?
I wish.
I did this because I care about my dad.
As soon as El Diablo starts making some noise and he knows I'm legit, then I'll tell him.
Maybe then he'll let me take over the family business and finally retire.
Hopefully before he gets really hurt.
Whoa!
Psychic vision.
Incoming!
I see colors.
On your hands.
On your bike.
On your hands.
My daughter My sister My Father the Hero.
Yeah, I repainted my bike recently.
I had paint on my hands.
Repainted, why?
Because you stole it from your dad?
I borrowed it.
Dad was supposed to use this in the last jump but Manny got us a sponsor and a new bike.
Tech specs said the new bike was way safer.
Left this one for me.
Who the hell is Manny?
The agent.
Oh.
Look, you guys aren't gonna tell him who I am, right?
Mmm.
It's a sensitive subject.
He won't understand it right away.
I just want him to come to grips with This is what I am.
I didn't choose it.
Yeah.
I had a similar experience with my dad when I told him I wanted to take Gus, here, to the prom.
Come on!
You and me at the prom?
No?
Misfire?
Okay.
So, the exploding motorcycle was provided at the last minute by Dutch's agent, Manny, who probably slapped those sponsor decals on himself.
I'd say that warrants investigation.
It doesn't make sense.
Why would an agent risk his client's life?
Isn't that his money train?
Remember the after party?
I told you, Clutch.
Explosions.
Crashes.
That's what people pay to see.
Manny may not be trying to kill Dutch.
But he's making his stunts more dangerous to add a little pizzazz to Dutch's act.
Which in turn gets Dutch more gigs!
Which in turn is only increasing Manny's 10%.
Which in turn makes me wonder why you would use the word "pizzazz.
" What are you doing?
I'll give you an A plus for the skulking but a C minus for the leering.
I have to find Lassiter a date for the weekend.
I've narrowed it down to three prospective candidates.
Jules, why would you possibly want to jump into that snake pit?
Vick ordered me to.
All right.
Would you like me to give your candidates the psychic once-over?
If you have to.
I'm sensing it'll be easier to get a stranger to go out with him than someone he works with.
Or knows him.
Or has ever had a conversation with him.
Or he hasn't shot.
One more question.
Are we locked into the same species?
Enough, already.
What're you guys doing here?
We need a background check on Manny Robertson.
Oh, I know that name.
Yeah, we've had him in here a few times on some "get rich quick" scams.
Why him?
I'm getting a very strong vibe off him on this awesome daredevils case we're working.
Daredevils, really?
They're still around?
Don't Don't do that.
Don't hate on the devils.
I just I never got it, personally.
I mean, "Ooh, I can jump over a flaming trash can.
" I mean, why do people care?
Allow me.
What is he doing?
Wait for it.
Wait for it!
What's up!
Gus, Gus, Gus!
Ow!
I'm okay, I'm okay.
I'm okay.
Need any more proof?
No.
I got it.
I'm I'm fine.
We need to find Manny as soon as possible.
We should have a little breathing room, actually.
If Manny's our mad saboteur, he won't strike until he has an audience.
During the actual stunt.
Not during rehearsal.
Exactly.
The next stunt's tomorrow.
A jump, at the closing night of the fair.
Dutch should be safe till then.
Clutch!
Or not!
Holy Are you all right?
Huh?
Are you all right?
Should we call the cops or the ambulance?
What the hell for?
I've done that stunt a thousand times.
That was just a rehearsal.
Now, it's your turn.
Come on!
I've got you set up over at the stadium.
You know, Dutch, seeing as how Gus and I are just getting started, we've a couple questions about representation.
Namely, uh, your agent, Manny.
First, we rehearse.
Then I gotta strip Viki down and oil her joints.
Wow!
Not too shy about your wife, are you?
I'm talking about my bikes.
I name them all after my wife.
We'll just talk to Manny himself.
Whereabouts is he?
I'll call him later, after I give Viki a lube job and pull her nuts.
Hey, guys!
Come on!
We gotta get ready for that catapult stunt!
You boys ready to work?
Strip and put these on.
All right, this one's easy.
All you gotta do is stand here.
How the hell are we supposed to help Dutch when we're stuck doing this stuff?
As long as we're making sure the stunts are safe, he can't get killed.
I'll make it safe from the outside.
You need to man up!
I'd put these masks on, if I was you.
What for?
What is this?
An underwater stunt or something?
Wait, is that gasoline?
You must be out of your damn mind!
Well, we had to see how fire retardant these suits were.
You didn't know that before you tried to set us on fire?
That's what you're getting paid for!
Dutch.
Dutch!
Great news, baby.
Apparently, some crazy fan ran El Diablo off the road at the classic bike show and he injured his shoulder.
He can't do the clock tower death drop stunt.
And I got it for you.
Rock on, Manny.
Oh!
All right.
We're gonna have to rig these two up and drop them off the building first.
No, no.
No time to rehearse.
Thank you, Lord.
Time of the event was already advertised.
If we want it, we gotta do it now.
You up for it, Dutch?
What, are you kidding?
Hell, one time I bungee jumped off a building twice the size of that tower.
And even though the bungee cord snapped on the way down, I still made it to the George Thorogood concert that night.
True story.
Yeehaw!
Yes, sir!
We're gonna make some money, Dutch!
No rehearsal.
That's convenient.
Manny's rushing Dutch into another stunt unprepared.
Another stunt.
Another chance for sabotage.
What is going on?
Apparently, Dutch is going to jump from the building, spread his arms, and glide down to that large pillow, all live on camera for some daredevil website.
Yeah, I think we're good.
Red?
You see that?
Yes.
And now I'm in the mood for some coffee.
What are you talking about?
Coffee, Shawn.
What are you looking at?
The same thing you're looking at.
It's a Dunkin' Donuts patch, Gus.
And they have excellent coffee.
They have one on my extended route.
You know what, dude?
You astound me.
And now I must have a blueberry crumb.
It's totally triggered my donut launch sequence.
Will you focus, Shawn?
I can't!
No.
Don't jump!
Jeez!
What the hell is wrong with you?
Everything's wrecked now.
VIKl: Are you all right, baby?
Gus, little help!
Grab my hand!
Grab my hand!
Idiot!
You could've killed my husband, you idiot.
Gotcha!
Idiot?
How about mind-blowing genius?
Dutch, please.
Spread your arms the way you would in the middle of the stunt.
I don't take orders from nimrods like you!
Dutch, do it.
Do it!
If you would've jumped, you would've died.
What the hell kind of stunt was that you tried to pull out there?
Nobody steals my spotlight!
Nobody!
You're just damn lucky Manny pulled me off that roof before I had a chance to throw you off it.
Dutch, I'm gonna level with you.
We're not really professional stuntmen.
No.
Now, that'd explain all the screaming.
So, what the hell's going on?
Well, we're um, uh Animal activists!
Right.
And that is the truth.
We are here to stop you from abusing any more large, impressive, exotic game in your act.
Shame on you, Dutch the Clutch.
I ain't got no animals in my act.
Huh!
Well, that settles that.
Yeah.
Gus and I will be going.
Sit down!
Now, the next thing that comes out of your mouth better be the truth.
Otherwise, we're gonna start rehearsing that "bury you alive" stunt.
We're detectives.
He's a psychic.
We were hired by your son.
Look, Dad, I can explain.
I am a Christian man!
What the hell you trying to do getting me all mixed up in that voodoo dark force stuff?
He We think someone is trying to sabotage your stunts.
Let's just hear them out.
Have you guys found anything?
Yes, we think that it's your We're not sure who it is yet, exactly.
That's because nobody's trying to kill me.
News flash!
Almost dying is par for the course for my line of work.
Dutch, someone tampered with that gliding suit.
The spirits are sure of it.
That gliding suit tore because I bought it during the gliding suit boom in 1977.
And that fall wouldn't have killed me!
Damn, one time I jumped out of a blimp five hundred feet in the sky.
Had a heart attack on the way down.
Two hours later I was eating a BLT at Red Robin.
True story!
Dutch, please listen to us.
No!
You listen to me, 'cause I'm only gonna say it one time.
You're fired!
Red, help these boys out.
Wait a second.
Whoa, Red!
Whoa!
Huh.
So, we're not gonna shoot Gus out of a cannon later?
No?
Okay.
Okay.
There's something I love about these low-end stakeouts.
All we gotta do is snap some pictures of the guy with some stolen merchandise.
Why didn't you wear the burgundy turtleneck?
Because it didn't occur to me to change for a stakeout.
Why?
No reason.
I just I really like you in that burgundy turtleneck and with short hair.
And you know what else?
A little cologne.
Wouldn't kill you.
All right, you think I don't know what's going on here?
Look, I've noticed you kind of checking me out at the squad and asking about my dating habits.
It's not a big deal.
It's just Listen.
It is perfectly normal for a junior officer to develop feelings for her superior, someone she feels is a mentor and Oh, no!
No, no.
Oh, my God, no.
O'Hara, it's okay.
No!
No, Vick ordered me to find you a girlfriend.
What?
Yeah!
You know, we've noticed that you've been on edge lately.
And, uh, thought it might help.
And I have this friend you can meet later who likes cops I don't believe this.
That's a total invasion of my privacy, not to mention unprofessional.
And so what?
I sleep alone.
So what if I saw a frozen dinner in half before I microwave it every night?
So what if I seriously considered planting evidence on my wife's new boyfriend?
I mean, that's It's just Oh, God.
I may need your help.
That's all I wanna do.
Oh, damn, I'm not getting a signal.
All right, I'm gonna go find a hot spot and then when I get back, I'll tell you all about my friend.
Why didn't you tell them about Manny?
Because it's not him.
When Manny was adjusting Dutch's suit before the stunt he whispered something in his ear.
I, of course, read his lips.
He said he didn't want him wearing that gliding suit.
He wanted him to wear the black one because it was far more slimming.
And then he said, "Purple camel lawn mower, man.
" How the hell are we supposed to help Dutch now that we've been banished?
Mmm.
I'm gonna go over there and start working on it.
You're wasting energy, Shawn.
You see solar panels up in there?
Come on, now, you guys gotta hurry.
The next stunt is coming up fast.
And Dad will kill me if he finds out I let you back in here.
Don't worry, Lewis.
We'll be as nonexistent as an Aldo Nova fan.
So what are we looking for?
Red.
When he gave us the heave-ho, I saw an old tattoo on his arm.
The first four letters spelt "Viki" but So?
So he was probably seeing her before she married Dutch.
Right?
She leaves him, he gets a different tattoo artist to add the N-G-S to conceal it from his boss.
Maybe Red's trying to eliminate the competition.
Bingo.
Whoa, whoa.
Let me go first.
I'm more stealthy.
In your dreams.
I'm as graceful as a gazelle, Shawn.
You are not.
A jackal.
Dude, a jackal is not graceful.
It's like a rabid, vicious badger.
Shh!
Now what is that?
This is it.
I'll bet you that's a bomb and he's gonna put it on one of the bikes.
Huh.
Come on, Red.
Let's get this over with.
What the heck?
Dude, why would someone take gemcitabine, or capecitabine?
Wow.
You were nowhere close on the pronunciation.
What are they for?
Those two together, you probably got pancreatic cancer.
Prognosis?
Not good.
It's pretty terminal.
He's dying?
So, Red's not the bad guy.
He wouldn't smuggle in drugs to help Dutch and then turn around and kill him.
This case is bizarre.
Why kill someone if he's already dying?
That begs the question, who knows he's dying?
If we don't come up with something soon, he's a goner.
We need to know who stands to gain from Dutch's death.
And for that we need his will.
But Lewis said there was no will.
He doesn't know his dad's dying, Gus.
If you were dying of cancer, wouldn't you have a will?
Are you kidding?
I've had my estate planner on speed dial ever since we started this stupid business.
Do you know how many times I've had a gun shoved in my face because of you?
Three?
Wrong answer.
We're never gonna find it.
Wait a minute.
There's something weird with this tile.
Looks fine to me.
No, no, no.
The pattern's off, just a little bit.
Like someone pried one up and put it down wrong.
Ow!
Bingo.
Is that his will?
It's just as good.
A life insurance policy.
That doesn't make any sense.
Tell me about it.
Dude, seriously, tell me about it.
I have no idea what this means.
You never could understand legalese.
Oh, really?
Remind me who it was that set up our Psych 401?
Oh, you mean our Because India doesn't have 401 s. It's a growth economy, Gus.
We've already made like five hundred rupees.
That's thirteen dollars.
Man, just tell me what I need to know.
Shh!
Do I rush you when you're doing your whole, "Ooh, I'm sensing this, I'm sensing that"?
Always, and you usually jab me in the ribs with your elbow.
Feels like a chocolate harpoon.
Are you finished?
Maybe.
On first read it says if Dutch dies of natural causes, there's barely a payout.
That doesn't make any sense for someone who's always putting himself at risk.
But, Dutch has a unique indemnity policy.
If he dies during one of his stunts, his beneficiaries receive Who are the beneficiaries?
His wife and his son.
Gus.
I know who our killer is.
And it is a packed house here for tonight's main event!
The legendary Dutch the Clutch Jenkins in his most dangerous stunt ever.
We are moments away from show time, ladies and gentlemen!
What the hell are you doing here?
I thought I fired your ass.
I just came to apologize to you, Dutch.
For what?
I was wrong about you.
All this time I thought you were the kid who shot milk out of his eye.
You know?
Willing to do just about anything for attention, regardless of how it affects the people around you.
But that's not the case, is it?
Son, I'm getting tired of the sound of your gums flapping.
You're all about family.
Aren't you, Dutch?
You love them more than life.
That's why you've been trying to kill yourself.
I sense a dark cloud over you.
You're terminally ill.
I'm sorry, man.
It must be so scary knowing that you're gonna die, especially when you're all that your family has.
And that's why you took out that special insurance policy, the one that only you know about.
Now all you gotta do is make sure that you die in the middle of a stunt and your family gets a windfall.
Right?
It should have been a simple matter of you sabotaging your own stunts.
But, Dutch, you're a victim of your own talent.
You actually are a little unkillable.
Even with all your faulty mechanics, your instincts kicked in and prevented you from failing.
It's almost show time, folks.
Dutch the Clutch Jenkins is here to perform a gravity-defying spectacle.
Look, I know this is your last stunt for a while, and that's my fault.
If this disease gets you before your next show, your family gets nothing.
So, I'm sure whatever your method is tonight, it's foolproof.
What're you gonna do now?
Nothing.
I'm not gonna try and stop you.
And I will not say anything if you go through with it.
You have my word.
Just let me leave you with this, Dutch.
It doesn't take a psychic to see how much people love you.
Your son came to me, and hired a psychic against his better judgment to keep you alive.
And you don't know this yet, but all he wants in the world is to be more like you.
You go to your son or your wife or anyone on your crew for that matter, and you ask them which they'd rather have.
Six more months with you or a million dollars.
You know damn well what they'll answer and they won't have to think about it for a second.
Is that right?
True story.
You're wrong.
I was that kid in class who shot milk out of his eyes.
And I was damn good.
And here he is now!
Dutch the Clutch Jenkins!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
Dutch!
And he's off!
Speeding down the ramp.
He's past the point of no return!
It's all or nothing!
He did it!
He did it!
A perfect landing.
Give it up as Dutch is doing a victory lap around the arena!
What a night!
You've witnessed history here tonight, folks!
Ladies and gentlemen, let's hear it!
No, really?
You grew up your whole life in Santa Barbara?
Yeah, I didn't like it much Oh, no.
Who did, right?
I just cannot believe that!
That's amazing.
That's fascinating.
What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just talking to your friend Blair, here.
She's great.
We have so much in common.
She's not my friend!
What do you mean?
You didn't send her down here to meet me?
No!
I don't invite friends to dangerous stakeouts.
But I know her.
She's a professional.
Please tell me you're a hitman.
Oh, Carlton!
So, are we gonna do this or not?
I gotta go.
So, I guess we're not on for Saturday, huh?
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 3}{START OF EPISODE 4}
Don't say a word.
Fergulous.
Shawn, I said no words.
Oh, I see how it works.
Two weeks ago, we're playing Scrabble, it's not a word.
Now, suddenly, it is a word because it's convenient for you.
Oh, buddy.
Dude, you've got some peat moss jammed behind your ear.
It could be infested with mites.
Mites?
I lost a $200 shoe.
Your dad almost got a skull fracture.
You're the one who got us into this, and absolutely nothing happened to you.
Would you two stop it?
I've been on the other side of this table a thousand times.
You tell them only what they need to know.
What do we say about Uncle Jack?
He's not here, is he, Shawn?
Why don't we take care of ourselves?
We didn't do anything wrong.
We didn't break any laws.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
What What did you do, Shawn?
Nothing.
It's just that laws keep changing.
It's getting very challenging to keep up with them all.
Did you know, for instance, that it is now illegal to give a perm to a possum?
What?
Shawn.
Did you or did you not break any laws?
We impersonated priests.
What?
What?
We were professors.
We were priests, Shawn.
You gentlemen have a lot of explaining to do.
You can bet your ass I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.
Don't I get a phone call or something?
No.
Fine.
How about a text message?
I'll be quick.
I just need to respond "OMG, LOL".
Here's a question.
How do you make the face that's winking, with the tongue coming out one side?
Mr. Spencer!
Now, by my estimation, you may be in some serious trouble here, so I'm only gonna ask you this once.
Where's the gold?
It's not quite as simple as that.
Right, if we were to really answer that question, we'd have to go back quite a while.
How long?
About 20 years.
As the rain thundered down from the dark night sky, and 30-foot waves crashed over his ship, the great pirate Bouchard stood on his bow, pointed at the California coast and yelled, "We shall take this land as ours, men"!
Your dad's awesome.
I know.
I'm so glad my dad didn't come.
I mean, I don't even know what a manager of debt consolidation does, anyways.
Except drink.
Rumor has it that Bouchard was obsessed with searching for Spanish gold.
They also say he may have had syphilis and went crazy searching for something that never existed.
But I say the gold did exist!
Okay, my dad has to go now.
Thanks, Dad.
See you later.
Bye.
What?
What the heck's going on here?
Officer, we're just in the middle of a class.
Is there a problem with something?
Yes, there is a problem.
That's not Shawn's dad.
Because I'm Shawn Spencer's father.
You're not Shawn's dad?
Ah, well, you know, technically Uh, technically, that is my brother Jack, who technically didn't tell me he was coming to town and obviously cooked up this ruse with Shawn to fool his new teacher.
What were you thinking?
I don't know.
I just thought it would be cooler if Uncle Jack spoke.
Look, class, I'm sorry to break this to you, but He's not a real treasure hunter.
And this is not real gold.
Kids, my big brother Henry is absolutely right.
This is not real gold.
But it is real chocolate!
What does this have to do with the gold?
Relax, Lassidophilus, we're getting there.
Last night What can I say, the movie didn't make any sense.
Of course it didn't make any sense to you.
You came in 20 minutes late, fell asleep for an hour, then woke up and asked me what happened.
You always do this.
What can I say?
They're making the movie theaters too damn dark.
It makes me sleepy.
So, basically, I paid $10 for you to take a nap.
Uh, basically, I paid.
Dad, someone's in the house.
Oh, my God!
Let's call the cops.
We should call the cops.
You keep a stun gun in the birdhouse?
What's under the garden gnome, an M-80?
You want me to poke you in the eyes on the roof?
We're calling the cops, right?
Why aren't we calling the cops?
Dad, wait!
Stop!
Uncle Jack!
I knew it was you as soon as I saw the penny.
The kid!
Shawn, my boy!
And by the way, that's a '59 penny.
It's the first year they used the Lincoln Memorial on it.
I want you to keep it.
Thanks, man.
Jack?
Dude, a hose?
Really?
What were you gonna do?
Give him a high colonic?
Shut up, Shawn.
No, no, no, no.
I get it.
You bust in here, you blind him in water, and then you make your move, baby!
Come here, you!
Ah, boys.
It seems like only yesterday I was bringing you kids to the track and we were betting the ponies.
I was the only eight-year-old kid who knew what a trifecta meant.
Uncle Jack, I haven't heard from you since you sent that email from Prince Albert's boat in the Maldives.
Yeah, well, I had to sign a confidentiality agreement there, guys.
I can't really talk about it.
Oh!
By the way, I got presents for everybody.
Hey, hey, hey!
Got these when I was excavating near Machu Picchu.
Dug them up myself.
It's been three years, Jack.
What are you doing here?
Besides breaking into my house.
Breaking in?
You gave me a key, Henry.
I didn't give you a key.
I don't give anyone keys, not even Shawn.
Oh, that's not true.
I actually made a copy a while back.
It was when I was hooked on Wow!
Wow!
Wubbzy!
on Noggin.
I didn't have cable.
Oh, I also stole your toilet paper for about a year.
And a huge box of sporks.
I guess you are wondering why I came back.
I want you to help me find Bouchard's treasure.
Come on, not that again, Jack!
I hate to break it to you, little brother, but Bouchard's treasure does not, has not, and will not ever exist.
It's a pipe dream.
Don't listen to him, Uncle Jack.
He's a dream killer.
Yeah, I understand his frustration.
All those years spent listening to me drone on about the whole treasure thing, without even a semblance of proof.
I get it.
One thing confuses me, though.
If it is just a figment of my imagination, where did I get this?
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Why do I feel like he can see us?
No, it's impossible.
He can't see or hear a thing.
That's just weird.
So, what?
We're just gonna let this guy listen in on everything?
It's out of our hands, Detective.
Now just get in there and get to the bottom of this.
You got it.
When are we gonna find out the deal with the suit-guy in there?
Let's just get back to the story.
I can't believe your Uncle Jack actually had a treasure map.
I can't believe you actually pretended your uncle was your dad.
I wanted Gus' dad to do it, but there was a genealogy issue I just couldn't resolve.
What else can you tell us about the Bouchard guy?
We could only remember bits and pieces of the Bouchard myth, but Jack filled us in on the rest.
November, 1818.
Bouchard sailed up and down the California Coast, searching desperately for the mythical Spanish gold.
He ravaged and looted the Mission at Monterey, was repelled at San Juan Capistrano, and finally made land here, in Santa Barbara, where he did battle with a small Spanish garrison and the Chumash Indians.
Yeah.
I remember reading about that.
They said he made off with millions in Spanish gold coins but his boat sunk off the coast north of here.
He disappeared and years later he showed up in Argentina.
Superior retention of historic detail, Gus.
Bouchard was also fond of hiding clues to the treasure's whereabouts in the maps.
I stumbled upon this one while researching him in Argentina.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
First you say you're in Machu Picchu in Peru, and all of a sudden, now you're in Argentina, so which one is it?
Dad, he's not a suspect.
Oh, he's suspect all right.
Forget him.
Forget him, okay?
My big brother's always been just a little cynical.
And that's what I love about him.
You still haven't answered my question.
So, what about it, boys?
Wanna be treasure hunters?
Are you kidding me?
That's like asking me if I want my own jet pack.
Or if I've ever wanted to be a koala bear.
Okay, I think he means yes.
You can count him in.
And me too.
Superb.
Mmm.
You know, I've been reading a lot about that detective stuff you do, and it seems to me that having a psychic might be a real asset.
Who knew I had one in my own family?
Well, Uncle Jack, I I don't know.
I'm not really I wouldn't necessarily say psychic.
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Stop that right now.
Don't you do that to yourself, young man.
Do not sell yourself short.
Do not feel embarrassed, just because you're a little different.
Didn't I always tell you, you'd be great, didn't I?
Yeah, you did.
Okay, now here's the plan.
Everything we find, we split 50-50 That's after we donate most of it to a museum, right?
We are so gonna do that, Gus.
Right.
You and I are really, up here, in sync.
Okay.
So the first thing we need to do is Get matching fedoras?
Get matching fedoras?
You're the one who wanted the fedoras, not me.
Stop changing the story.
My mistake.
He wanted the yellow gauchos.
I said no to that.
Oh, would you please put me in a separate room from these idiots?
I will tell you everything.
Just continue.
Jack had told us to meet him at the front steps of the mission, because that was the first step on the map.
Gus and I could barely contain our excitement.
I contained mine a little better.
Okay.
Just follow my lead.
Say yes to everything.
Oh, welcome.
Welcome.
I'm Karen Raven, head of the Santa Barbara Historical Society.
We are delighted to have such a distinguished professor as yourself visiting us.
I am Abner Espinoza.
These are my compatriots, Ernesto Agapito Garces con y a de Abelar, and Juan Priestly.
Oh, now I see where you got the priest thing.
What does that mean?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Well, welcome.
Please, come this way.
Now, as you know, most of our prized collection pieces are kept away from the public.
But, well, we're happy to open our doors for visiting dignitaries, such as yourselves.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay, then.
Um Take as much time as you need.
And Bill, here, will be waiting just outside.
All right, boys.
We've got about 10 minutes before the real Espinoza shows up.
There's a real Espinoza?
Well, technically speaking, we used to be partners.
He's a great guy, but we had a little falling out when I had a small dalliance with his wife.
And his sister.
And his housekeeper, Debbie.
Uncle Jack, what's really going on here?
My research has told me that there are clues about the treasure's whereabouts hidden somewhere in this room.
And it all has to do with the number 152.
Why don't we just use the map?
Well, technically, there's, uh, something I haven't told you about the whole map.
Uncle Jack!
This is a pretty big thing to leave out.
Yeah, I know.
I know.
I know.
It's a long story.
A one-legged woman, a bottle of Cutty Sark The point is that the missing part of the map is the first step of the hunt.
Now, come on, kid.
Use that psychic gift you got.
Come on.
Oh, boy!
I'm seeing letters, swarming.
They're zinging!
Oh, they're forming words!
They're forming words!
"Couleur.
" Couleur.
Couleur.
Couleur?
What does that mean?
French Color Paint!
Painting.
That's it!
Come on, let's go, hurry up!
More!
There's paintings over there.
Wait, wait, wait!
Go back!
Go back!
Hello, Bouchard.
Let me see the map.
Where did you hide that clue, you old syphilitic sea dog?
I know where the map starts.
And I know where the first clue is.
Wait.
The map was actually real?
Oh, yeah.
We couldn't believe it.
The lighthouse was the first clue.
What happened from there?
We didn't make it to the second clue.
Why not?
Because we weren't the only ones who found the lighthouse.
All right, Spencer, tell the Chief what you just told us.
Okay, Chief.
Here goes.
We're so hungry.
I can't get the burrito place on Coda Street out of my mind.
They're open late.
Gus, children's burrito, no sauce, Dad, I know you're a fan of the carne asada.
All right, Mr. Spencer, let me be frank.
As long as I can be Dean and Gus can be Sammy.
Why do I have to be Sammy?
Fine.
He's Sammy.
That makes you Joey Bishop.
Is that what you really want?
You wanna be Joey Bishop?
Shawn?
I'm sorry, Jules.
How often does someone set you up with "Let me be Frank"?
Shawn!
Don't forget that you are in a lot of trouble here.
And I am probably the only person in this room who cares to see you get out of it.
Now, it's 2:30 in the morning, we've been here for hours, enough with the jokes, stop delaying, and tell us what we wanna hear.
Oh, my God.
That was so hot.
Spencer, tell the Chief what you told us about the guys who chased you away from the lighthouse with the guns.
Not just chasing us.
They found us, hiding in a cabin.
Who were they?
Jack's partners.
Because the one thing that you could count on with my brother Jackie, he always had partners.
Jack!
What the hell are you doing?
Mark, calm down, will you?
It's all part of the plan.
Wait a second.
You guys know each other?
Oh, yeah.
We were partners.
I thought we were partners.
Well, technically, you're all my partners.
Well, I don't know where you guys went to partner college but I'm pretty sure you're not supposed to shoot at your partners.
Yeah?
Should partners do this?
Maybe we shouldn't use the word "partners" anymore.
It seems to make him mad.
Mark.
Kitten, listen, this is my nephew Shawn, okay?
He's psychic.
For real.
Works for the cops sometimes.
Fully legitimate, fully.
I only brought him around to help with the hunt.
And I was just gonna pay him a small finder's fee.
That's it.
What's finder's fee?
Is that like 50%?
Not even close.
No.
Not buying it.
You were gonna sell us out.
Oh!
Psychic things are happening to me!
Oh!
Running down my legs!
Oh, oh!
Oh.
Oh.
Welcome.
Welcome.
I'm Karen Raven, head of the Santa Barbara Historical Society.
You don't worry about the pregnancy.
Your girlfriend's gonna be just fine.
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?
What'd I tell you?
Now, why don't you just let us go?
We'll all find the treasure.
We'll be stinking, filthy rich and live fabulous lives!
No.
Give us the map.
We don't have the map.
Really?
That's too bad.
Okay!
It's in the backpack.
Thanks.
What are you What Wait, just wait.
Wait.
It's in the side pouch.
Hey, Gus, should we tell Mark that there's a tear in the map?
Son of a bitch, Jack!
Hold it!
So you just gave them the map and told them everything?
No, not everything.
Okay, everything.
So, they found the treasure?
Not exactly.
Okay, I may have psychically led them down the wrong path.
The spirit world is just one of life's little mysteries.
Like why the Oxygen Network airs Goodfellas, or why fools fall in love.
Ow!
Here you go, Mr. Guster.
This is all they had in lost and found in your size.
An Ugg boot?
I can't wear an Ugg boot with It'll be dope with my one Puma.
Now, Mr. Spencer.
Yes.
Oh, I meant the older Sorry, not old, less Handsome.
Less hair?
Less friends on Facebook?
Less nose.
Oh!
Henry.
Did you fill out a burglary report in your house yesterday?
I did.
But nothing was taken.
Oh.
And yet, why do I feel this somehow plays into this whole mess, doesn't it?
I was the one who picked them up.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
How did your dad know where to find you if that Mark guy took all your cell phones?
That is a good question.
I have to pee.
No.
No way, Shawn.
Well, what am I supposed to do?
Hold it like a man.
I'll get a urinary tract infection.
Like a man.
You know what?
You could link your legs underneath your chairs and form a wheel and roll to the bathroom.
I don't even wanna project how that's gonna happen.
I'm not rolling anywhere.
I don't know why I listened to either one of you.
No one is gonna find us.
We're probably gonna die out here.
Gus?
What?
What is that on your leg?
Nothing.
Dude, you are strapped with another cell phone?
Well, just call Henry.
Come on!
No, no, no.
We're not calling anyone.
That is my work phone.
For work.
This is work.
My boss is watching everything I do, Shawn.
Plus, you already used up half my minutes waiting on hold for concert tickets.
That was Tony, Toni, Tone, and Wet Wet Wet playing together!
You know I can't resist that.
The symmetry alone All right, Gus, this is our only choice, man.
Fine.
Shawn, reach down and get it.
Me?
I'm not gonna reach down and get it.
You get it.
With what hand?
Fine.
I'll do it.
Hold still.
Stop it!
You're wobbling!
Hold on, now!
Stop flexing.
Ow!
Hold it.
Okay, it's ringing.
Fu's Palace.
Want to place order?
You must've dialed the wrong number.
Hi!
We're stuck out in a cabin on Tunnel Road, can you send help?
For pick-up or delivery?
This is Jack Spencer, and I'm willing to offer you a Hang up, Shawn.
Hold on.
While he's on the line, you guys want anything?
Will you dial it again?
And this time try to dial the right number.
Look, man, I'm dialing with a ten-year old Erasermate in my mouth.
It's not an exact science.
You've reached Henry Spencer.
Leave your name and number, but speak slowly because people talk too fast in these things and I can never understand it.
Hey, Dad.
What's going on?
Uh, I got good news.
Great news!
The electric wrench you've been wanting, is in stock at Home Depot.
Uh, what else?
I know there was something else!
Oh!
I know.
If you're not too busy, Gus, Jack and I are tied up in a cabin about 100 yards off Tunnel Road, right by where we had the pulled pork sandwiches that one time.
Shawn?
Spencer, are you gonna answer my question or not?
How did your dad know where to find you?
With some people I can communicate through psychic wavelengths.
My father is one of them.
Val Kilmer is another.
Here's something I don't understand.
Jack's partner wanted the map, right?
So, why would they trash your dad's house?
They'd know Jack wouldn't let the map out of his sight.
But Mark and his men, they weren't looking for a map.
So, what were they looking for?
You know you're my boy, Shawn.
Why did you have to go and give Mark the map?
Because I don't need it.
Uncle Jack, trust me.
I can recreate the map psychically in my head.
Hey!
Hey.
Spare me, kid, okay?
You can't snow the snowman.
We were so close.
Stop!
Oh!
I feel jittery.
It starts with beans!
Gus likes it in the morning.
Now, he has gas!
Something having to do with coffee?
Yes!
Coffee!
Coffee, coffee, coffee, coffee table!
Coffee table!
Mark and his goons weren't looking for the map, were they?
No, no.
They were looking for something else.
A different piece of the puzzle.
Something you didn't want connected to the map at all.
Oh!
That is downright scary.
Maybe you really do have a gift, kid.
My bad for doubting it.
You know, this key is also from Bouchard's stuff I found in Argentina.
It was useless without that map.
But if Shawn can actually recreate that map, that plus this key means we are back on track!
Guys, I gotta hit the head.
But when I come back, we are finding us a treasure.
Hope he bought that.
With Jack, you never know.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
But if that key is real Shawn, come on.
Take a look around.
Haven't you had enough?
These guys They've destroyed my living room.
Mark and his goons aren't gonna stop!
We gotta get back out there!
Dad!
No!
No.
Shawn, no!
Just come with us!
Come with us!
Why do you need me?
It's not that we need you.
We want you.
Plus, we need you.
We need your truck, because my car is still at the lighthouse and Mark has the key.
There you go, thank you very much.
Sorry, count me out.
Shocker!
Okay, guys, ready?
Good.
All we gotta do now is borrow a car.
Now, technically, the term is hot-wiring.
However I'm in.
But I drive, I'm the one who decides if and when we go to the police.
I don't want any more surprises.
Do you understand?
Yes, Dad!
Big bro!
I knew you'd come around.
Okay, psychic, what's the next step?
Shawn?
The key will guide us now.
I love this!
and you guys!
No more surprises, right, Jack?
Of course.
Tell me this, Shawn.
How are we supposed to find clues from a bell tower that hasn't been around for over 100 years?
The Presidio was huge.
It would've taken up several blocks.
So, what should we do now?
There's only one thing we can do.
Go back in time.
The bell tower's calling me!
Shawn!
Come on!
Shawn, wait up!
Shawn!
This is it.
This is where the bell tower stood!
Well, what do we do now?
Let's buy some mufflers.
He doesn't even own a car.
I bet you, I end up paying for these.
You all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll survive.
What're we doing up here, Shawn?
I'm not sure yet.
But that's part of the fun, isn't it?
We are good to go.
The manager said we can take as much time as we need.
Alvin.
Good guy.
Filipino.
He loved me.
And Jack offered him I also gave him an '82 penny.
First year they used zinc instead of copper.
Okay.
What is the deal with you and all these pennies?
Yeah, I don't get that either.
So, Jack collects them and then leaves them places?
What's that about?
Jack was always interested in history.
Collecting pennies was his way of being a part of it.
But leaving the pennies was his own personal philosophy.
See, Uncle Jack always said I leave the penny, because it's good luck.
And Lord knows, the world could use some more good luck.
Are you for real?
All right, Shawn, what're we doing up here?
You think that when Bouchard captured the fort, he stood up here, on the bell tower, gazing out into the big blue ocean, looking for a place to hide the treasure?
If I were a French pirate, with a bad temper and at least one venereal disease, where would I be looking?
That's it.
That's it, right there!
We're so close.
Let's go!
Hey!
How did he find us?
He's got the map.
He must've figured it out.
Come on!
Let's go!
Shawn!
Shawn!
I can't lose my Puma, Shawn!
I got it!
This is it!
This is the bluff from the map!
Uncle Jack!
I know this probably isn't the right time to say this, but dude!
I think we're gonna get to ride in a helicopter.
You're obligated to let me speak to them.
I'm not obligated to make you do anything.
Chief, perhaps you should see this one more time.
No, I don't need to see the letter one more time.
Jules.
Lassy, what's going on out there?
What's the deal with that guy?
He didn't say a word to us when he brought us in.
His name is Andres Candalaria.
He works for the Spanish government.
Apparently, he's part of some inter-governmental task force on stolen antiquities.
Hello, Mr. Spencer.
I believe you know why you're here.
And I believe you know I know why I'm here.
Now, why am I here?
To help us find the treasure that rightly belongs to my government.
But we didn't find anything.
Si.
And my men have been searching the bluffs all night, as well, with no luck.
That's because you stopped us one step short.
Your treasure is not in the bluffs, che.
The spirits are guiding my man paw!
It's like it's like that movie, Idle Hands.
Except with no nudity, which means, I must be completely unwatchable right now.
Do either of these words mean anything to anyone?
It could be the clue we're looking for.
"Cueva" is Spanish for cave.
"Couleur" could be French.
I think it means paint.
I spent a semester in Paris.
Got salmonella poisoning and lost 20 pounds.
Best diet ever!
Painted caves!
That's it.
Bouchard was French, but he was fascinated with the Chumash Indians.
Whoa, whoa!
Chumash Indians.
Well, they used to paint caves all over the area.
We used to roust punks in there from drinking all the time.
"Roust punks"?
Thank you, Jack Lord.
We will now lead you to the treasure.
I know the cave.
Very well.
Let's go.
Stop.
You are not doing this.
The only reason I brought these men here, in the first place, was because Spencer would not talk with us unless he was in the station.
Okay.
Look, I said we would cooperate with you, but they are employees of the SBPD, and they're not going anywhere without my detectives.
Chief, we have been through this, no?
This is from your Treasury Department, giving me full power to call the shots.
Now, I thank you for your help, but it will no longer be needed.
Sorry.
I can't believe we're actually digging for buried treasure.
I know, dude.
And you're getting your pants totally dirty and you don't even care.
I'm so proud of you.
Keep digging!
"HB".
That could be for Hippolyte de Bouchard!
No.
No, that doesn't make any sense.
Just get it out.
Oh my God.
It's real.
Si.
Well done.
You should know the Spanish government owes you a great debt of gratitude.
Now, could I please have the coins?
Before we do that, I should tell you, I know three things that you probably don't know.
Uno, the secret of NIM and the secret of my success?
Same secret.
Dos, I know that you don't work for the Spanish government.
And tres, these caves are actually quite slippery.
What are you doing?
Bag!
Bag!
Bag!
Bag!
Bag!
What is going on?
Why are we running?
Why did we leave the caves?
Hey!
Shawn!
Shawn!
What happened to your other Puma?
You gotta be kidding me!
I lost another shoe?
Let's go.
This way!
Jack!
Jack!
Yes!
Hey, guys.
I told you I'd come back.
I've been tracking you the whole time.
You, uh, have the treasure?
This is it.
I always believed in you, kid.
I always knew you were special.
Ah, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't come in here.
We gotta split up for safety.
Listen, they're not gonna hurt you if you don't have the gold.
Believe me.
I know what I'm talking about.
What?
Come on!
Let's have it.
Remember the place on Foothill, where I used to take you when you were a kid, get you burgers and shakes?
Yeah, it's Red Robin.
It's still there.
That's the one.
Meet you there in an hour.
I'll be there.
Yee-haw!
Damn it!
You gave him the gold, didn't you?
Hey!
That's my gold.
Who the hell are you?
If there were doves flying around, we'd be in a John Woo movie.
Son of a bitch.
I'm going to kill Jack.
Oh, you know Jack?
He was my partner.
He was my partner!
Uh, technically, Iron Giant guy, he was all of our partners.
And the guy who answers the phone at Fu's Palace.
And the guy at the muffler shop.
Good catch, Gus.
Look, fellas, we're just gonna roll on out, if that's cool.
Let you settle your business here.
Not so fast.
Why don't we just take the nephew and ransom his ass for the gold?
We have no other choice.
No, no, no, no!
You always have a choice.
You could ransom Gus' ass.
You could swirl it up.
You could ransom half my ass and half his ass.
Drop it!
Hands in the air!
Shawn, you know I don't curse very often.
So when I do, you know I mean it.
What the hell just happened?
I thought you weren't a big fan of the wrap up.
All right, I'll give it to you.
So, back at station, I realize Andres' accent isn't Spanish, it's Argentinean.
And that's where Uncle Jack just got back from, so I figure he's one of Jack's partners.
How did you know that?
He worked in that winery in Argentina for a year.
I kept the postcards.
You did?
I use them as beer coasters.
Okay, Shawn, but So that's why I called Andres "che," to see if he'd react.
Which he did.
Because in Argentina, "che" is slang for "buddy" or "pal.
" Sort of like I call you "black star" or "home skillet" or "big baby Burton.
" Don't ever call me "home skillet.
" Right.
But why didn't you tell anybody?
I did.
She knew just what to do with it.
Sorry, Jules.
Doesn't matter what happened.
The important thing is you guys are safe and nobody got hurt.
Now, let's get out of here.
I'm too old to be staying up all night.
Can't believe I lost my other shoe.
Dude, I will buy you another pair.
Just tell me you didn't really drop 200 bones on sneakers.
No, Shawn.
I was making a point.
How much were they, really?
And I had $32 left on my Foot Locker gift card.
So, what am I looking at, like 30 bucks?
I'm in for half.
We'll get some jerk chicken on the way home.
Fine.
Hey.
Hey.
Strawberry, huh?
Oh, you gotta taste it.
I'd still go vanilla.
It's good.
Are you kidding me?
That is the best shake on the planet.
One part ice-cream, two parts awesome!
It's been a long time since you called me for a ride.
Yeah, well, Gus got tired of waiting for someone who wasn't gonna show.
All right, look, Shawn.
Here's the thing about your Uncle Jack.
He'll always come back.
You're not the first to get duped.
You certainly won't be the last.
Welcome to the club, kid.
I guess I probably owe you an apology.
I can see now where Uncle Jack might not have been the best role model.
Yeah.
Maybe not.
Why didn't you say anything when I was a kid?
Because I always wanted you to have the The "fun uncle" in your life.
I was only hard on you because I didn't want your life to turn out like the "fun uncle.
" Well, it didn't.
Not totally.
Here you go.
Thanks.
You know that penny thing?
Your grandpa taught me that, and then I taught it to Jack when we were kids.
He just took it to another whole level.
Yeah, he, uh He seems to do that a lot.
I still can't believe that he got away with the gold.
You gotta think that someday all this stuff is gonna catch up with him, huh?
Yeah.
And that day might just be today.
Does Gus know about this?
Oh, yeah.
He's got the rest of it.
Don't worry.
We're donating it to the museum.
All of it?
Ish.
I saw Jack following us.
I knew he was gonna show up in the car.
I made the switch when we were running through the forest.
So what does Jack have?
Well done, Shawnie.
Well done.
Well done.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 4}{START OF EPISODE 5}
Okay, come on.
Go!
Move it out!
Listen, Franks.
You have the right not to get shot.
Make the wrong move, you lose that right.
Put down the bomb.
Good move.
We recently obtained intelligence of a bomb plot by an anti-government radical.
His intended target was this very building.
We owe the success of this investigation, and indeed our very lives, to Sergeant Henry Spencer.
Well done, very good.
Very good.
Sergeant Spencer, would you like to say a few words?
Oh.
No No thanks, Chief.
A police officer doesn't deserve any special attention for just doing his job.
You may be able to sense the electricity in the room.
That's because our arrival usually signals that a huge case is going down.
Step in here please, gentlemen.
That's the Chief, she likes the two of us very much.
I'm sorry, you are?
Ah, sorry, Chief.
I got roped into doing a silly interview with The Independent.
They've been calling and begging for weeks and I finally relented.
But you called me.
And you called me back, which means we're both right.
The important thing is that you got your cover story.
Actually, this is page 64.
It really depends on how you fold it, doesn't it?
She can't be in here, so get her the hell out.
Uh, come to think of it, I think you'll probably get a better shot here, through this window.
Now, try to catch me with a good expression, preferably with this eyebrow raised.
Like so.
Or my serious face.
Best case scenario, snap a shot when my signature look comes up.
I call it "Senor Gotcha"!
How will I know what that is?
You'll know.
Good luck, we're all counting on you.
Lassy, you're here!
I need you here.
Thank you.
Chief, what's up?
Mr. Spencer, as you may be aware, a A California prisoners advocacy Are you okay?
Right as rain.
Long story short, a handful of convictions, some of them decades old, have been recently called into question.
Unfortunately, the biggest one was a Santa Barbara PD conviction.
So, we're reopening the case and launching a new investigation.
Now, we're hiring you You to provide us with any psychic leads that you may have.
Now normally, we don't devote department resources to this, but these are special circumstances.
Oh, could you do the handoff again, Chief?
Thanks.
Oh, no.
What is it?
It's my dad's biggest case.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end It goes without saying, Mr. Spencer, that your father is in no way to participate in this investigation.
He's no longer on the force and his meddling could compromise the case in court.
Do I make myself clear?
Yes, you do, Chief.
What isn't clear is why people always say "it goes without saying," yet still feel compelled to say the thing that's supposed to go without saying.
Doesn't that bother you?
No, and frankly I could care less.
Now, that's the one that bothers me.
Why do people say "I could care less" when they really mean "I couldn't care less"?
Well, why don't you tell me how to properly say this?
If you share any official information about this case with your father or let him anywhere near any new evidence Then the two of you will have to find another police department to work for, and I will personally see to it that each of you is charged with obstruction of justice.
You split an infinitive.
Good catch, Gus.
You two realize I carry a gun, right?
That was perfectly elocuted.
My dad's gonna freak when he sees this.
We have to go into stealth mode.
No taking his calls.
This won't hit the news until tomorrow.
That should give us a Hand it over.
Dad?
How did you get in here?
The unlatched window, the unlocked back door, maybe this key that I made.
You choose one.
What do you want?
I just dropped by to share my new chocolate chip raisin bread recipe with you, Shawn.
What do you think?
I know Chief Vick just gave you the new Franks case, so why don't you let me take a look at what you're hiding in that little folder there so I can get moving on this?
Okay, fine, you're right.
Chief Vick did just hire us.
But there is no way Nope.
That I am showing you what's in this folder.
You're lucky I'm even asking, Shawn.
I could do this the simple way.
I could grab it from you, clean up any evidence of a struggle before you and your little friend here knew what hit you.
In some states, that's called child abuse.
I think all of them.
Look, Chief Vick made it very clear that you, specifically, were to come nowhere near this case There shouldn't even be a case, Shawn.
The son of a bitch was let out on some microcrap problem with my search warrant.
Everybody makes mistakes.
There was no mistake.
It was the '70s.
We did what we had to do.
But only when we knew we had the right guy, and I got the right guy.
Period.
Okay, you got the right guy.
Still doesn't mean I'm gonna put you on this case.
Nor would I even want to.
Dad, you have no idea how Gus and I roll.
Gus, tell him.
You know what?
You go and handle this half-assed like you do everything else.
But you bear this in mind.
This case is important to a lot of people who could've died if he had blown up our headquarters.
It should be important to their family members, too.
Never seen my dad beg before.
That's how he begs?
He's clearly not gonna let this go.
So, look.
If we're gonna investigate this thing undisturbed, we're gonna have to jump ahead a few steps and fill in the blanks when we're done.
We should go straight to the D.A.'s office.
Beat you by eight minutes!
Not too embarrassing.
Dad!
I knew you would come and try to investigate this on your own.
Do you have any idea how dangerous this is?
Why?
I'm a taxpaying, voting citizen, therefore I have a right to speak to any elected official, such as the D.A., I please.
You don't have to be a taxpaying, voting citizen though, do you?
May I help you?
Yes, my name is Shawn Spencer, I am the head psychic for the Santa Barbara Police Department.
And that is my partner Yeah, yeah, that's his partner Methuselah Honeysuckle, which makes me Old Scratch Johnson.
Listen, we need to see copies of the original court transcripts for the Eugene Franks case.
I'm not sure I can release those.
Oh, oh, oh!
I'm getting a very soft, cuddly vibe here.
Seems like you and your wife recently Yeah, yeah, they're gonna have another kid.
It's a boy.
Congratulations.
Do yourselves a favor, don't call it Shawn.
Problems!
More importantly, according to the Freedom of Information Act, those transcripts are now available for public viewing.
So Very well.
Good point.
I'll have our records department make copies.
Thank you very much.
You know, you're really putting a damper on the proceedings here.
You call it a damper, I call it working All right, that's it.
Come here.
All right, I need you to hear me, okay?
If you insist on staying involved in this case, there are going to be rules.
I was hired by the police department, therefore it is my ass on the line, and those rules will be made by me.
You are no longer a cop.
And unless you plan on going back to the academy, and climbing the high wall, and doing the obstacle course where you shoot the bad guys but not the old lady with the sack or the blind guy with the cane or the cute little squirrel with the bushy tail and the big fat nut!
It started off well.
It really fell apart at the end.
You should've had a name for the wall or something.
What I'm saying is that you need to listen to me, is what I'm saying.
All right, Shawn, point taken.
You got a deal.
That means you're working for me now.
Why don't you grab some coffee for us.
Black.
Two sugars.
Two sugars.
I don't understand.
You guys had to handwrite everything?
What if you needed multiple copies?
Well, we had one computer, but it took up the entire second floor.
Generally, we would use the mimeo machine.
How long would that take, a week?
You know, all the hi-tech, fancy gadgets they use today don't solve crimes any better than we did.
A good detective is born with all the tools he needs right here.
Hello?
Chief, what's the good My dad down at the D.A.'s office?
No, I don't think so.
Uh, I think I can clear this up for you, Chief.
Uh, that wasn't my dad.
That was Phil Collins.
Yeah, we saw Phil down at the courthouse.
My dad gets mistaken for him all the time.
Shawn, I don't look, I don't look anything like Phil Collins!
No, I'm, I'm fairly certain about this, Chief.
He was humming Invisible Touch, if that helps you.
No, I wasn't aware that Phil Collins lives in Switzerland.
How does she know so much about Phil Collins?
I don't know.
Yes.
I do hear you, I will make sure he stays away.
Love you, too.
Do you see?
Do you see?
We have to be more careful Okay, hot shot!
All right, I get it.
Tell me what you can glean from this.
You'd like to know what I can glean?
Glean.
The D.A. Rested after only submitting the initial evidence?
Correctamundo.
The evidence I uncovered in that apartment was so strong, the D.A. Didn't need anything else to get a conviction.
But all that evidence is poisonous fruit because of the search warrant.
This evidence, yes.
Good thing I got a different warrant for the second round, and the D.A. Didn't submit any of that stuff, which means we can use that now.
All the hi-tech gadgets in the world won't tell you that, will it?
We gotta get the Chief to let us into the county archives so we can take a look at that evidence.
Gus, give me your keys.
That would be a no.
Ogletree's checking my mileage.
We'll take my truck.
No, we won't.
That raises the chances of you being seen again.
We'll have to take my motorcycle.
I've always wanted to try threesies.
Who wants the handlebars?
Gus?
Feels like you.
No.
Yeah, that shouldn't draw any attention.
We'll cab it.
Fine.
That's funny, it's usually me who can't show my face in public.
Just think, the contents inside these boxes could determine whether someone spends the rest of their life in jail.
Catch it!
Better hope they don't reopen the Handyman Killer case, fingerprints are all over the murder weapon.
That's not funny, Shawn!
Dude, I'm kidding, it's not really evidence.
It was just lying here.
Well, stop it.
You know I'm afraid that being wrongfully convicted is the tragic way my story ends.
Would you two girls stop bitching and see what we got here?
What is this stuff?
Various possessions and personal effects of Eugene's we found after he was arrested.
All right, what've we got here?
A pawn ticket made out to Eugene a few days before he was arrested.
Goldstein's Pawn?
Anybody?
Wait, that place is still around.
Desperate people pawn things.
Let's see what Eugene pawned that he never got back, huh?
Two new cases just came in.
One involves an international diamond smuggling ring.
Sweet.
Bingo.
The other involves fraudulent permits at a plastics factory.
Well, I'll leave it up to the two of you to decide who gets which.
I am the head detective.
Who owes me.
I covered your butt on last month's paperwork.
Damn it!
Follow my lead.
McNab, get over here!
I don't know, O'Hara, I don't think he's ready.
Yeah, I don't think he is either!
No, I'm ready.
All right.
McNab, how would you like to do some real police work?
I'd love to.
Now, technically, you'd be working under Detective O'Hara and myself, but we'll let you take the lead on this.
It will be such a good experience for you.
It might even earn you a spot on the detective bureau some day.
Wow, thanks, guys.
This means a lot.
The fact that you think so highly of me to trust Yeah, yeah, we love you.
Get back to work.
Uh, this ticket is from 30 years ago, when my dad ran the shop.
Yeah, I'll have to go look through the box.
The box?
What do you think the box is?
A giant room, like in Raiders?
I think it's a box.
Secret catacombs underneath the building, like in National Treasure?
Shame on you for knowing that.
This is where we keep all the old unclaimed stuff from over the years.
As I said, a box.
What do you think is inside the box?
Will you calm down?
I can't, man!
There's stuff in there.
All kinds of stuff.
Old stuff.
Shiny stuff.
Secret stuff.
How come you're not as excited as I am?
Because I'm not a raccoon.
You look like a raccoon.
You're in luck.
This ticket here matches this old receipt.
Not a lot of info on it, I'm afraid.
Oh, I know what that is.
Let me get it!
Right, your case.
Oh, I'm getting something here.
Oh, this is intense.
I can see Eugene.
He's desperate, he's sweating nervously, he's stinky!
He wants to get rid of something, cover his tracks, hide where he's been.
So, he brings in the title of his car!
That must be the Vehicle Identification Number, right in there.
Right.
Whose benefit was that for?
Don't ever question my methods in front of a civilian, okay?
Never do that.
Come here.
I always thought that Eugene was gonna use the car in the bomb plot.
That was a common M.O. Back then.
He probably pawned the title to cover his tracks.
If nobody reclaimed the title, we would've sold it.
We could use the VIN number to track where it ended up.
That could take us all over the city, or the state, for that matter, thus increasing the chances that you'll be seen by someone you work with and you being caught by the police.
Unless Nobody recognizes us.
I feel ridiculous.
Speak for yourself.
I've got this shirt at home.
His mother used to love it.
Yeah, like, 30 years ago.
Kid, I wore it to lunch last week.
There it is.
It's been sitting in some old lady's backyard for dang near 30 years.
You got the keys?
Let's take a look inside.
Make me an offer and it's yours.
You gotta be kidding.
Just give us a second here.
All right, how much money do we have between us?
What?
All right, I think I got about 50 bucks.
Okay.
I got about $400 between my wallet and my sock.
It's my just in case money.
All right.
Add in what I have and we've got about $450.
All right, let me go talk to him.
Uh, uh, uh.
You stand down, Popeye Doyle.
I'll handle this.
We got about $450 here.
Now, how much is this gonna cost me?
$450.
Done.
He's good.
Nice going, Shawn.
That was all of our money.
That's what happens when you send in the one guy who's never bought a car before.
We had exactly enough!
All right, look at it this way, Gus.
It isn't a car, it's a time machine.
This little kitty is gonna tell us about Eugene 30 years ago.
Well, looks like a car to me.
And if I bought it, I'm driving it.
That means my same car rules apply.
Wipe your shoes before entering.
No slamming doors.
No food.
Looks good up here.
Doesn't look like factory soldering.
Smuggler's hatch.
Gotta get this down to the crime lab.
Uh, uh, uh!
Let me guess.
This is where we take one step back before involving the police?
We need to see what's on that film first.
That's how we roll.
Gonna need a tetanus shot.
Got it.
Miracle anything came out.
Whoa, this guy really loved his car, huh?
Well, after seeing it all cleaned up, I like it too.
In fact, I love it.
Bingo!
You think these two are the ones who could've had something to do with the bombing?
Oh.
From the AK-47 s they're holding, they had something to do with something.
I think it's worth checking out.
There's no telling where they are, if they're even still around.
You know, back then, I used to have this snitch working for me.
His name was Pookie.
A real weasel.
That guy'd turn on his Siamese twin for a buck.
If these two had anything to do with this, Pookie's the guy who would've known.
I'm sorry.
What was his name?
Pookie.
Do you know where we can find this, uh Pookie.
Yeah, his name is His name is Pookie Wigginton.
And yeah, I know where to find him.
What's so funny?
Stop!
I mean, I mean Nothing's funny.
You're just, you're keeping it real right now, Dad.
Right on.
All right, let's see if we can find Pookie.
See if he still remembers the '70s.
If that'd been on purpose, that would've been totally cool.
I need to get that power steering fixed.
Not to mention the seat is jammed all the way to the front and makes my entire left side fall asleep.
And remember, tomorrow night will be ladies' night at Top Flight dance club, where it's the '70s every night.
Don't worry.
I think Pookie remembers the '70s just fine.
By the way, I'm just, I'm just putting this out there.
Once we resolve this case, preserve your legacy as a detective, you don't have to say thank you.
No biggie.
Course it is.
In fact, let me say it right now.
Thank you, Gus.
You're welcome.
That's Pookie.
Let's go.
Officer Spencer, long time no see.
What brings you gentlemen to my establishment?
Well, Mr. Pookie As you may have heard, the D.A. Recently overturned the conviction on the Eugene Franks bombing case.
Maybe I heard.
Maybe I didn't.
Right.
Well, we're looking for information on a few people that might've used to run with old Eugene.
Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about.
All right, all right.
I know how this works.
Gus, hit the other sock, give him some money.
No offense, guys, but I don't need your pocket change.
Mr. Pookie, I can see two of Eugene's partners in crime, a man and a woman.
Dangerous, highly skilled with military weapons, but not US military, smuggled weapons.
I used to trip like that, always looking for the escape.
Pookie, he's cool.
He's, uh Psychic.
Really?
Then I can dig it.
Spiritual.
Yeah.
Third eye.
That's where it is.
You guys are deep, like me.
Give me five.
So, listen, you were dead on it.
Check this out.
The cats you were describing ran with Eugene, all right.
Mmm-hmm.
There were two of them, Derek Ford, white guy, stringy hair, and his old lady, Melanie, really fine.
I got shot over a white girl like that once.
Anyway, they were together in a militant organization with Eugene called SAG, Soldiers Against Government.
They were into all kind of radical stuff.
Why would Eugene go all those years and not rat them out?
Word on the street was that SAG was ruthless.
Nobody dared cross them, not even one of their own.
So, Eugene was just a patsy?
You didn't hear it from me.
No, them suckers are dangerous.
He had partners.
My biggest bust, and I was wrong.
Everything hurts.
Had to be a tough guy and go in first.
Just fill out the incident report and be done with this fiasco.
Ow!
What happened to you guys?
The diamond smuggling case that Detective O'Hara wanted to take didn't go quite as planned.
That I wanted to take?
You're the one who insisted on it, Mr. Head Detective.
Basically, we conducted a stakeout to catch the smugglers red-handed.
But when we opened the cargo container to seize the evidence, we discovered we had the wrong one.
This one belonged to exotic animal smugglers, and it was filled with wild marmosets.
I hate marmosets.
Apparently they don't like being shot at.
No.
Apparently not.
All I can remember after that are, are hundreds of those tiny razor-sharp claws and teeth.
Lower primate, my ass.
I recognize a military formation when I see one.
You'll be happy to know that case you gave me took a fun turn.
That's great.
It turns out that plastics factory was a front for real-life sea pirates.
You're kidding.
No.
They've been using hi-tech boats and GPS to rob freighters in the shipping lanes.
Now, I'm teaming up with the Coast Guard for a showdown off the Santa Barbara coast.
On the high seas?
Appears so.
Aw, gosh!
I'm sorry, Buzz, but you need a certain level of clearance to work with the Coast Guard.
It's It's department rules.
Really?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm afraid we're gonna have to take over from here.
But good work on getting us to this point!
Oh!
Well It was fun while it lasted.
Yeah.
Yeah!
Good work, buddy.
We're gonna capture pirates.
I know!
Ow!
Almost makes up for the rabies shots.
Almost.
Let's face it, Shawn.
I blew the case.
You're quitting on me?
I'm not quitting.
I just realized that maybe Chief Vick is right.
I should stay out of it.
Dad, this was your big case.
My big case?
My big bust?
You see, that's the problem right there.
That's how I started seeing it.
But in reality, it's a Santa Barbara PD case and it always has been.
You don't believe that.
A good detective knows when to let it go, Shawn.
That's a lesson both you and I can learn right now.
Where's your dad?
He's not coming.
He says it's to protect the case, but I can tell it's really bumming him out that he got fooled 30 years ago.
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but instead of lording over him that this is our case, our rules, I think we have to convince him that we can't solve this thing without him.
And how do we do that?
Most likely through the use of trickery.
So what kind of wood are we gonna use for these bookshelves, Gus?
Uh, cypress?
Cypress?
Really?
It's a good wood.
It's what Noah's Ark was made of.
Nah, you wanna use something that breathes a little more.
But don't worry, we'll hit a lumber yard on the way there.
At least I'll get a chance to use my new laser level.
Gus, why are we stopping here?
No reason.
I just randomly selected this spot.
Don't be a smart-ass.
You're reading an address off a piece of paper and we're sitting in somebody's driveway.
Whose house is this?
Okay, look, Dad.
Actually, we're dropping in on some people that we know.
Shawn, I think that's them!
What the hell is going on?
Don't lose them!
Go!
Go, go, go!
Come on!
So, what do we do now?
I don't know.
I've never cornered anyone before.
You better hope they're not uneven in there!
I'm gonna blind them with the laser, Shawn.
May we help you?
Uh, Derek and Melanie Ford?
Or should I say, Soldiers Against Government?
You sure your father doesn't wanna come inside?
Oh, no, no, no.
He's clinically insane and a biter.
Sorry again about running from you guys.
But when we saw the Mercury Cougar in the driveway, we just figured it was Eugene coming after us for revenge.
Revenge for what?
He thinks that we set him up to take the rap for the police headquarters bombing.
We know he's been asking around town about us, trying to figure out our whereabouts.
We thought he'd finally found us.
Well, don't you worry about that.
You help us with this investigation, we will make sure the police protect you from your old pal Eugene.
Thank you.
Tell them everything, honey.
Okay.
After Eugene got arrested and we stopped our radical ways.
We became Soldiers For Government and we built this great life.
You have to believe us, we had nothing to do with setting Eugene up.
I mean, we were all brainwashed.
We were all caught up in the movement.
Do you know of anyone else who would've wanted to set him up?
Oh!
Honey, are you okay?
Mmm!
Oh, yeah.
Oh!
I cut myself pretty good.
I, uh, excuse me.
I'm gonna have to go put something on this.
I'm sorry.
Uh, we should be going.
Oh, no!
No, no, no.
Thank you for your cooperation.
And rest assured, Eugene will not learn of your whereabouts.
Nice meeting you.
Yes.
Hope your finger feels better!
Thank you!
Good news, Pop.
The trail is hot again.
Like I said, count me out.
Damn it, Dad!
Do you have to be so prideful all the time?
So you made a mistake 30 years ago?
Nobody cares!
Just get over it.
Not everybody is as comfortable screwing up as you are, kid.
Well, maybe the reason I'm so comfortable is because my mistakes were the only thing that was ever pointed out to me.
Here we go, here we go!
Would you put away the violin?
I pointed out the good stuff, Shawn, but usually, you were too busy bragging and showing off to take notice.
Enough!
I'm sick of you two fighting all the time!
Listen, Mr. Spencer, Shawn needs you on the case because, frankly, you're old and we were barely even alive during the '70s.
And Shawn, your dad needs you on the case because even though you can be extremely annoying, you actually have a brilliant idea every now and then.
But you're both too damn stubborn to admit that you need each other.
Now, can we go, please?
Thank you.
Is he always such a know-it-all?
You don't know the half of it.
Very preachy.
All right, so tell me what you have.
Well, I think there's another SAG member out there.
How do you know that?
Did you see Melanie when we asked her if there was anyone else who'd want to set up Eugene?
She cut herself, right there.
Right there on the spot.
Yeah, no, no.
Maybe they were telling you what they wanted you to know, not what you needed to know.
I think they're protecting somebody from Eugene.
But there were only three people in the picture.
No, there was four.
The three of them and whoever took the picture.
Maybe they're protecting an old mentor.
Well, I'm pretty sure that Eugene met Derek and Melanie when they were all students at Santa Barbara University.
Let's see if they shared any professors, advisors or RAs.
RA, that's a thing, right?
It is.
Okay, let's do this.
Back to undercover.
Got it.
Thank you, Jules.
All right.
According to Juliet, university records show that our SAG members only shared one professor, and that is Doctor Richard Colbert.
Doctor Colbert?
I think Eugene got here before we did.
Hey.
Been waiting for you guys.
Yeah, we got your call while we were out on the open ocean, chasing down our sea pirates at flank.
That's a nautical term for maximum speed.
We cordoned the pirate vessel before they could club haul, that's the nautical term for evasive maneuver, and make it to international waters.
Well, that sounds awesome.
What do modern-day sea pirates look like?
We have no idea.
Apparently, once you get three miles out, it's out of our jurisdiction, so the Coast Guard had us sequestered to a tiny windowless cabin on the Lubber Deck.
Yeah, apparently that's a nautical term for "place they send you to puke.
" I had to wash my hair three times.
Still sorry about that.
Let's do this.
So, what do we have here?
The deceased is one Doctor Richard Colbert.
Male, 60 years old, professor of chemistry.
Apparently, he died from a lab accident involving poisonous hydrochloric acid fumes.
When will people ever learn that alcohol and hydrochloric acid don't mix?
Technically, they do.
See, the hydrogen atoms in the acid form a loose bond with the chlorine What the hell are you wearing?
I'm getting some serious jive, and it is fly.
I can see the struggle.
There's a rag on Colbert's face.
It was him who masterminded the bombing 30 years ago.
He set Eugene up, and Eugene has murdered him in revenge.
But wait, there's more!
Ooh!
Yeah, feel is strong!
I am getting it!
And it is a bad mother Shut your mouth!
I'm having a vision.
I can dig it!
It's a It's a big birthday cake!
Make a wish!
What?
Bomb!
Eugene's built another bomb!
He built it here in the lab!
That's how he's going to exact his revenge on the remaining members of SAG!
We gotta stop him now!
That That's all I got.
The jive's over.
We should go before people explode.
Found him lurking around out back, must've hidden this under the house.
We've got a bomb!
Which hasn't been activated.
Call the bomb squad.
Well, Eugene, looks like you've been up to your old tricks.
I'm only here because they called me saying they were finally ready to come clean!
Invited guests don't go snooping around the back, now do they?
I was just checking to see if anybody was home.
I swear!
Save it for the trial.
You're under arrest for the murder of Richard Colbert.
Wait, wait!
Colbert's dead?
And the attempted murder of Derek and Melanie Ford.
Thank God you stopped him in time.
Yeah.
I cut myself pretty good.
I'm need to go put something on this.
Maybe they were telling you what they wanted you to know, Shawn, not what you needed to know.
Whoa!
Lies!
Lies!
Lies!
Lies!
Yeah!
You two!
You were two young kids in way over your head with the militant SAG, so you used Eugene as a scapegoat, didn't you?
Set him up to take the fall for the police headquarters bombing, so you could make a clean break.
But then you heard he got out early, and you were afraid he'd come track you down and expose your criminal past.
We know he's been asking around town about us, trying to figure out our whereabouts.
We thought he'd finally found us.
Because, of the four members of SAG, only two of you are doing okay for yourselves.
Eugene has lost 30 years.
What?
And he will be marked as a criminal forever.
Doctor Colbert, well, his drinking destroyed his career.
But you two, your life is picture-perfect.
And you would kill to protect it.
First, it was Doctor Colbert, whose guilt-ridden conscience and drunk mouth would cause him to confess everything to Eugene.
And then the plan was simple.
Frame Eugene for that murder, and then blow Eugene up right along with all the traces to your past, so you could move on to a very bright, white, pickety future.
That's a preposterous theory.
Preposterous.
You have no proof.
Oh, really?
What if I did something like this?
Spencer, what the hell did you just do?
In exactly one minute, we will all be blown to smithereens or the people responsible for making that bomb will deactivate it.
Don't look at me, he's crazy!
Yeah, I don't know how to do it either!
I demand that someone disarm this bomb right now!
Just do what they say.
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!
Let's go!
Arrest them.
Come on!
Go.
Spencer, I'd appreciate, in the future, if you just played with your own life.
Oh, come on, Lassy.
If Derek hadn't caved, I would've just deactivated it myself.
It's very easy.
You just clip the red wire and the green wire at the same time.
Uh, Shawn, there is no green wire.
Really?
Huh!
Well, in that case, we all would've died.
I am starving.
Who's up for fajitas, my treat?
Oh, come on, you guys!
Not everybody would've died!
Well, a couple of people would've lived.
Those are The odds are that at least one Gus would've made it.
It'll only take a few minutes for me to finish my interview with The Independent.
I still don't see why you have to drag me into this.
I told you.
They're gonna wanna hear about my last case, which was originally your case, and without you, it wouldn't have been solved again.
Interviews, press, hair.
Those are your things.
A little attention isn't gonna kill you, Dad.
Oh, and wait.
What?
Thank you.
And as the bomb ticked all the way down to zero, we held our ground.
And I looked those culprits in the eye, and they knew that their time was up.
We don't seek out the high-profile cases, they just have a way of finding us.
Oh, we should just show her!
That's a great idea.
Yeah!
Um Yeah, so, uh, you were there.
You were Oh, I was here?
You were like here-ish And I was like, here.
No, we walked up and then they walked out, they Yeah, they came up.
Oh!
Right, I remember, right, so They had the bomb.
They had the bomb.
Really, it was really dangerous.
They didn't know it was a bomb.
They didn't.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 5}{START OF EPISODE 6}
How can you be sure it's down there?
I can feel it in my bones, Gus.
All great oil wildcatters have that ability.
Me, Getty, Clampett, Crisco, and Wesson.
But your dad told us never to dig in the yard.
My dad doesn't understand the concept of taking risks.
All we have to do is find the oil and that'll show him.
Okay.
Let's say we do find oil.
What happens then?
All of our dreams come true.
I'll be rich and you'll work for me!
Hey!
Hey!
What the hell's going on here?
Hey, Dad, we were prospecting for oil.
How was your day?
All right, look.
There's grass seed and duct tape in the garage.
I want this yard exactly as it was, I don't care if it takes you both all night.
Do you understand?
You're bunching up over there.
Let's go!
Move that pipe!
Let's go!
All right, McCall, bring those forks in through here.
Watch it now, watch 'em!
Easy on the tongs, Woodruss!
Woodruss!
Easy on the tongs!
Don't break those chains!
You two are bunching up over there!
Let's move that pipe!
Let's go!
Hey!
Hey!
McCloud, watch that lift!
Check your line, Aldridge!
Hey, you!
You!
That's no man's land!
Get away from there!
Hey, buddy, I'm talking to you!
Clear the area!
Don't think I'm not gonna write you up!
Great.
I'm missing a huge symposium on new frontiers in medical treatment and I don't even know what for.
What is that, the, uh, the fungus one?
Yeah.
Don't play, Shawn, you know that fungus is my bread and butter.
Really?
You know what my bread and butter is?
Bread and butter.
Fungus has never entered into the equation.
Not once.
All the Chief said was time was of the essence and that she'd brief us on the boat.
I wonder what this case is about.
It obviously has something to do with the ocean.
Oh, Gus.
It could be anything.
Crab-on-crab violence.
Gang war between the mermen and the shark people.
Or maybe she wants to take us wild orca hunting.
All right, guys, come on up.
All right, hey, here's the deal.
A safety inspector named Butch Hicks fell to his death from an offshore oil rig last night, and his body washed up on shore.
The rig he was working on is the Bamford Number 7.
And that's where we're headed.
Okay, first of all, let me just say, awesome!
I've always wanted to go on an oil rig!
Excuse me, Chief, but how is this a police matter?
From what you've said, it sounds like an accident.
Yeah.
That's what the Coast Guard thinks.
But I'm not so sure.
We received an anonymous tip about a week ago that we traced to a pay phone outside the dive shop on the pier.
The caller said that something highly unsafe was going on out on that rig, and that he was risking everything to warn us.
Dude, harbor seal!
What?
Did you share this information about the anonymous tip with the Coast Guard?
Absolutely not.
I've had dealings with them in the past, and I don't trust 'em.
Well, if you suspect foul play, shouldn't your lead detective be here?
I mean, where's Lassy?
And Juliet?
Shouldn't she be here?
Okay, well, the truth is, um, what we're doing isn't exactly Well, we're acting more in an unofficial capacity, and any more questions and I'm gonna turn this boat around and take you both back to shore.
Understood?
I'm all right with that.
Except that Gus' leg is touching mine.
Is not.
He keeps looking at my ear.
Enough!
Now, we're gonna be there in about five This is the United States Coast Guard!
Stop your engine and prepare to be boarded!
Damn it.
I'll handle this.
Good morning.
Hey, good morning.
What brings you out here, Chief?
Oh, just doing a little sightseeing.
Yeah, is that right?
What's this?
Oh, it's a rig manifest?
Mmm-hmm.
You wouldn't be thinking of nosing in on my accidental death case, now would you?
'Cause that's my jurisdiction.
Oh, well.
Sorry to break it to you, Commander, but according to the GPS, that southeast corner of the rig crosses back inside three miles, which brings it under my jurisdiction.
Oh, you don't wanna come up against me.
Because you will lose.
Oh, we'll see about that.
Hi, Commander.
I'm Shawn Spencer, amateur dolphinologist, big fan of the briny and lemon squares.
Stay out of this, Mr. Spencer.
Don't worry, Chief.
I'm sure the Commander here is a perfectly reasonable human person.
Huh?
Here's the thing, we received an anonymous tip that there may be more going on here than meets the eye.
So with your blessing, of course, we'd like to go ahead and check out the rig.
What do you say?
An anonymous tip?
You weren't gonna share this information with me?
Like you ever shared anything with me.
I could have you brought up on charges.
You can't intimidate me.
I'm giving you exactly 10 seconds to get this vessel out of my waters.
Oh, I'd like to see you make me.
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, look!
My nose is touching your nose.
What do you think about that?
Can you do that to a Commander?
You can when she's your sister.
Don't you put your nose right up into my nose again!
What if I put it really close?
Or I actually touch your nose?
Just I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Yes, sir.
I understand.
The judge ruled with me on jurisdiction, didn't he?
Yeah.
But that doesn't change the fact, that I have far more experience investigating homicides.
That's right.
But this wasn't a homicide.
This was an accident.
You don't know that for certain.
I can't get over it.
After all this time, the Chief never said she had a sister.
Strange.
And such an alluring sister at that.
Creepy.
You should hear this.
I just got the Commander's bio off the Coast Guard website.
Commander B Commander Barbara Dunlap.
Graduated US Coast Guard Academy with honors, conducted multiple search and rescue operations, Kodiak, Alaska, assumed command Santa Barbara station 2002.
To date, interdicted over five million dollars of illegal narcotics and has saved 57 lives.
Very impressive.
Impressive and intoxicating.
I mean, all that power in one woman.
There's no photo.
Creepier.
I know that I don't care about your so-called experience, okay?
You are not getting anywhere near my oil rig!
Well, too bad, because we have a psychic, Mr. Spencer, who's going to figure out who our anonymous tipster is.
Which could be pretty darn important to the investigation.
Yes, it could.
And since this is now in my jurisdiction, your psychic is my psychic.
I Commander, Carlton Lassiter, head detective.
I had no idea that the Chief had such an accomplished younger sister.
She's older!
O'Hara, what are you doing standing there?
We have a missing person's case to work.
Well, I'd love to stay and chat, but I have an investigation to conduct.
Spencer, are you coming?
Yes.
May we have a moment with the Chief, Commander?
Meet me at the ship.
And I'll see you in an hour.
Don't be late.
All right, Chief, I only said yes so that we can You don't owe me any explanation.
You just do what you have to do.
Is it just me, or does she seem peeved?
All I'm saying is, so much for us being in Chief Vick's good graces.
We may have just burned our bridge with her.
Gus, don't be a myopic chihuahua.
I have a fool-proof plan that not only solves the case but gives Chief all the credit.
What is it?
Actually, all I have is the phrase, "I have a fool-proof plan.
" Beyond that, I'm wide open.
We received an anonymous tip about a week ago that we traced to a pay phone outside the dive shop on the pier.
Okay, research time.
Give me everything you got on offshore oil rigs.
All right.
Generally, oil platforms are located on the continental shelf.
Shelf.
Got it.
A typical platform has around 30 wellheads.
Drilling continues 24 hours a day.
And there are two crews on board at all times, one for the day shift and one for the night shift.
"Love brokers"!
Night Shift.
Come on, dude.
You got the Fonz playing against type.
Where is this boat?
Excuse us, is this where the Coast Guard boat launches from?
Are you Shawn Spencer?
I am indeed.
Commander Dunlap instructed me to give you this.
"Gentlemen, your job is to stay put and do nothing.
" I don't believe this.
She goes through all the trouble to hire us, and then leaves us behind?
Don't you see what's happening here, Gus?
We are merely pawns in a bitter sibling feud.
I'm nobody's pawn, Shawn.
I'm a queen.
At least I can make my conference on foot fungus.
No, no, no.
We cannot quit.
Why not?
Because we're not quitters.
And because we're doing this for the Chief, remember?
We've got to get on that rig.
Yeah, but how?
Have a good trip, Mr. Bamford.
The rig he was working on is the Bamford Number 7, and that's where we're headed.
I have an idea, but we'll need cool names.
So, Mr. Turner Please, call me T-Bone.
Okay, T-Bone, have you two invested in offshore drilling before?
Have we?
Yes, Lordy, yes.
So you're familiar with the technology.
Oh, I'd say it's pretty straightforward.
Got your basic rig with 30 warheads, sitting on the continental countertop, running 24 crews day and night every two hours.
That made absolutely no sense.
The truth is, no, we're not that sophisticated in the oil business.
I didn't think so.
Look, my father and I don't appreciate our time being wasted.
You'll have to pardon my daughter, gentlemen.
Apparently, Yale University didn't teach her any manners or how to get a husband.
Honey, run down there to the galley and mix us up some cocktails while the men talk.
Sure.
Wow.
You know, not to be rude, Billy Joe, but it's the have actually earned the right to be treated equally.
Cut the crap, son.
A blind man could see that you two aren't investors.
Technically, a blind man can't see anything, Billy Joe.
I offered you a ride out here so I could take a look at you, and figure out what you were up to.
What are you?
Government watchdogs?
EPA?
Is this about that little oil spill?
You had an oil spill out here?
No.
The truth, Billy Joe, is that we have not been completely honest with you.
We're working for the Coast Guard.
My name is Shawn Spencer, this is my partner, Chesterfield McMillan, and wife.
We're investigating the death of your safety inspector, Butch Hicks, and whether or not it was truly an accident.
But we were running late, so we missed the boat ride out here.
Well, as much as I don't appreciate being lied to, if you're right about Hicks' death not being an accident, I wanna know about as much as you do.
What can I do to help you?
Well, the first thing we'll need to see is Mister Hicks' personal effects.
And I will be needing a little baby umbrella in my mai tai.
What's our, uh, missing person's name again?
Doctor Christopher Renaud.
He's a professor at the university.
And last seen?
His 3:00 lecture on Thursday.
All right.
We're gonna need a, uh, list of all the people in attendance that day.
I've already obtained a list from the TA.
And I've set up interviews with each and every one of his students.
Good work, O'Hara.
Ooh, one more thing.
Shoot.
I am thinking of asking out Commander Dunlap on a date.
Your thoughts.
Um, well, uh, I think it's a bad idea, Carlton.
Really?
Why?
Um, well, for starters, you know, she's the Chief's sister.
Not to mention they don't get along.
I mean, you saw the way they were screaming at each other.
See it?
I devoured it.
It was incredible.
That Barbara, she's a real snap pea, isn't she?
Mmm!
She's got that great, sturdy build.
Yeah.
You know, why don't we focus on interviewing our witnesses for the missing person case, huh?
Mmm.
Absolutely.
Yeah.
Forget I even mentioned that other thing.
I will.
Now, there was an anonymous tip that something unsafe was going on out here.
Any clue as to what the caller might have been referring to?
I got no idea.
This place is run strictly by the book.
Butch Hicks made sure of that, and so do I. You can ask anybody.
My professional reputation is based on safety.
Watch your head going in here, now.
Somebody put a rail on this side of this ladder.
That's a violation.
Now, here's Hicks' office.
I see.
What's in here?
That's the geologist's lab.
My daughter is trying to get me all high-tech.
She thinks because I've punched a few dry holes that I've lost my touch.
And she talked me into hiring this fancy rock doctor to show me where to dig.
I don't need anybody to tell me where to dig.
Once this well comes in, like I know it's going to, I'm gonna be back on top again.
Well, you guys take your time.
If you need me, I'll be topside.
If you need us, we'll be bottoms up.
So, what are we looking for?
Anything that will help us figure out who the anonymous tipster was.
Or a Kit Kat.
I'm starving.
Since Hicks was in charge of safety on the rig, it's safe to assume that the tipster may have come to him first.
I have this big stack of safety violation reports.
Man, this guy Hicks was a real stickler.
If by stickler you mean a guy who doesn't have any snacks, then yeah, I agree with that.
What are you two doing here?
Not eating candy, I can tell you that.
My orders for you were to stay put and do nothing.
Really, that wasn't reverse-psychology?
Out.
Wait.
I was drawn to this office with very powerful psychic visions of a man in scuba gear, with a salamander in his wet suit.
Well, thank you, Mr. Spencer, but I don't see how that's helpful.
Or healthy.
Wait.
I'm seeing more.
The anonymous tipster.
I can tell you where he is.
Really.
And where is that?
The morgue.
Commander, look, my myriad psychic detective skills assure me that the anonymous tipster is Safety Inspector Butch Hicks.
Your psychic detective skills?
You left out myriad.
Right.
But wait, there's more.
I see a security camera in front of the dive shop.
All you have to do is review last Friday's tape, and you'll see that I'm right.
Fine, let's say you are right.
It doesn't change anything.
All the evidence still points to his death being an accident.
Let's go.
As long as I'm in charge of this case, you will follow my orders to the letter.
And my orders are that you get off this rig!
We have a shuttle leaving in an hour, you will be on it!
Is it just me, or is that woman a tinge bossy?
She scares me.
Let's hop to it.
We have less than an hour to interview every worker on the night shift.
No, Shawn.
Let's discuss something that won't get us into trouble, like where we're gonna eat when we get back to shore.
All that Kit Kat talk made me hungry.
Dude, this may be the only chance we have to weed out who might have wanted to kill Hicks.
If the Commander finds us, she's gonna go ape.
Do I smell meat loaf?
And fresh apple cobbler, if I'm not mistaken.
I guess it won't hurt to ask a few questions.
Well, hello, Miss Ashley.
Would you kindly direct my buddy and I to the chuck wagon, please?
I'm sorry?
We would like to know where the mess hall is.
It's two decks down.
Awesome.
Would you like to have lunch with us?
Perhaps afterwards you could give us a little tour.
Look, regardless of how my father treats me, I'm not the cruise director here.
So, tell me about the safety inspector.
That guy was always writing me up for the smallest infraction.
I hate to say it, but I'm glad he's dead.
There's no dairy in that, is there?
You know, I had a dream that I knifed him in his sleep?
But I woke up.
Hicks should have never gone into no man's land.
No man's land?
It's the area that's strictly off-limits during crane operation.
Hicks should've known better.
I mean, he was the safety inspector.
Anyway, it's a shame if someone loosened that tackle and killed him.
You know, you're the first person to show any sympathy for Hicks.
What?
No, I'm saying if it was me, I would've used a gun.
This place is lousy with suspects.
And excessively heavy food.
I think I ate my weight in that cowboy chicken casserole.
Man, this food was disgusting.
All I had was half a bran muffin.
What's our next move?
Well, I think we need to get into Hicks' house.
If there really was a conspiracy to kill him, we're gonna need hard evidence.
When we get back to shore, we go see Chief Vick.
Well, first we go home, change into our jammies, take a nap.
Then we wake up, have some juice, then straight to Vick.
All right.
Well, call me if anyone matching that description shows up.
Thanks.
Hey, Jules.
Chief in her office?
Ladies Room.
Darn.
Gus and I really need to speak with her.
Think you could give us a numeral so we can gauge just how long she'll be?
Oh, I don't know.
Five, seven minutes maybe.
How about number one or number two?
I have no idea, Shawn.
And no, I'm not gonna go to the ladies room and check on her for you.
Is this your missing person?
Doctor Christopher Renaud.
He's a professor at the university.
Missing for a week.
What are you two doing here?
Oh, we have our answer.
Tinkle.
Chief, we need your help.
Oh, you need my help?
Oh, I gotta give you credit, Mr. Spencer.
You have more than your share of gumption.
Please, Chief, this will only take a minute.
Come on, for old time's sake.
One minute.
No more.
Chief, I read every single worker on that rig.
And they all hated Hicks.
I'm getting two very distinct psychic vibes here.
The first, there was a conspiracy behind Hicks' death.
Second, Craig T. Nelson will donate his remaining hair to the Smithsonian.
Yeah.
Look, Chief, we need help learning more about Hicks.
And a good start would be access to where he lived.
I still don't understand why you're coming to me with this?
I mean, why don't you go to the Commander?
She really doesn't want us involved with this case.
Really?
Imagine that.
I'm sorry.
I can't help you.
As the Commander pointed out, this case is out of my jurisdiction.
And your minute is up.
Gus, will you excuse us?
I need to speak with the Chief in private.
No problem.
Just so you know, it was Shawn's idea for us to go with your sister.
Karen, Chief Karen.
Chief Karen Vick?
That just feels a little long, doesn't it?
I said I'm busy, Mr. Spencer.
I'm sensing something here Don't do that.
Look, the only reason I took this case was to help you.
Oh!
Really!
Help me how?
If I can tie that murder to a piece of evidence on land, the case is back in your jurisdiction.
Well, that's actually kind of sweet.
Don't tell anyone I used that word.
Deal.
Now, I know it's none of my business, but, uh, what is going on with you and Commander Babs?
It's complicated.
Believe me, I know what it feels like growing up with an older sister, who gets all the attention.
I didn't know you had an older sister, Spencer.
I don't.
But I did watch a lot of re-runs of The Brady Bunch.
You know, Barbara and I weren't always like this.
I mean, we used to be, well, close.
I know exactly how you feel.
And by I, I mean Jan.
So, was it something specific that brought things to a head?
No, nothing specific.
It's just years of trying to outdo each other.
So, should I go divine that piece of evidence I was referring to?
I don't know.
Should you?
Shawn.
Oh, uh, I'm sorry, buddy.
There we go.
Right in there.
Wow, looks like Hicks' obsession with safety did not extend to his colon.
Vick would go ballistic if she ever found out we broke in here.
We did not break in.
The window was open already.
Now, come on!
What the heck are we looking for anyway?
Anything Hicks may have received with the threat of violence.
Correspondence, angry phone messages, mash notes.
Mash notes are love letters, Shawn.
Really?
Remind me, I owe someone a huge apology.
Let's start with this computer.
I guess I have to break the pass code, Panther 21.
Panther 21?
Just try it.
That's it!
Mmm-hmm.
You got all that just from putting together things from around the room?
No, it was written on the bottom of the computer.
What?
I saw it in the reflection on the CD case.
All right.
Almost all of his recent emails are from someone called Bishop77.
"Why haven't you called me back"?
"The situation on the rig is getting more serious every day"!
"Why are you ignoring me"?
Dude, listen to this one.
"If you won't do something about this, I'll go to the authorities"!
Dude, you know what this means?
Bishop77 is the anonymous tipster, not Hicks.
And if we can figure out who he is, we can find out what's really going on out on that rig.
And who killed Hicks.
And why.
Bishop77.
He's Catholic or he plays chess.
I got it.
I got it.
A guy at work showed me how to take an email address and get its owners real name.
I start by using an email header to trace back to the original IP address.
What?
Dear God, what are you doing?
Shawn, what did I tell you about eating onions during lunch?
It makes your breath stink.
That's why I bought you those mints.
Use them.
Dude, I didn't eat onions during lunch.
I had everything but onions.
I don't smell anything.
That smells good.
That's smells really good.
Dude!
It's coming from inside here.
Well, open it up.
Why does it always have to be a dead guy?
Why does he smell like onions?
Will you help me?
Who do you think it is?
Is this your missing person?
Doctor Christopher Renaud.
That's Lassiter and Juliet's missing person.
Mr. Spencer, what's this about?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
He works for me.
Mr. Spencer, what's this about?
Look, the reason I called the two of you is because there's something in this house that concerns you both.
Oh, please don't tell me you went into Hicks' house without a warrant.
Hey!
Warrant?
No one talked to me about a warrant.
I need a warrant, all of a sudden?
I'm a diviner!
It all happens here.
And here.
And in extreme cases, here.
Okay, what exactly is in there?
A missing person.
A professor Renaud?
That's our missing person.
But we never found a connection between he and Hicks.
We'll check it out.
What would Renaud be doing in Hicks' house?
And how does this affect my case?
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, I'm getting something.
Talked me into hiring this fancy rock doctor to show me where to dig.
I don't need anybody to show me where to dig.
Renaud worked as a consulting geologist for Hicks' employer, Bamford Exploration.
It's Renaud.
Spencer's right.
Not words I enjoy saying.
Okay then.
Oh, I see that ties up the missing person case quite nicely.
This is usually the place where you say, "Nice work, Spencer.
" I'm sorry, Chief.
I didn't catch that.
So, uh, the victim worked for Bamford Drilling.
What does that have to do with Hicks' murder?
You know, if you don't mind, let me ask the questions now.
Because in case you haven't noticed, we're on land, which brings this case back into my jurisdiction.
Listen to yourself, will you?
"My jurisdiction.
" You're only interested in this case because you're itching to horn in on my turf!
Itching?
Listen to yourself!
Your turf?
We're talking about a whole ocean, not the TV room!
Whoa, whoa, sisters, please!
Nobody's getting horned here!
Two men are dead!
This is not the time for petty sibling squabbles.
That's what Thanksgiving is for.
We need to come together and work as a group to get to the truth.
And the truth is Renaud is our anonymous tipster, not Hicks.
I can see a series of emails from Renaud to Hicks, the safety inspector, warning him that something unsafe was happening on that rig.
But Hicks, he refuses to address the issue.
Probably because he's covering something up.
And then, fearing that the truth would get out, Hicks Stop!
Hammer time!
Hicks kills Renaud.
The question is, what was Hicks trying to hide?
Thank you for that eloquent summation, Mr. Spencer.
It's my pleasure, Chief.
I think our next move should be For me to have Lassiter and O'Hara now look into it.
Wait, wait, wait.
Okay, this is great.
Barbara just witnessed the Chief choose me over Spencer.
In her eyes, my stock just went up.
Now, if I can just get her to witness me discharge my weapon.
Well, Mr. Spencer, this case does warrant further investigation on my end as well.
Absolutely.
Thank you, Commander.
I think the first thing we need to investigate is why Hicks was in no man's land?
I mean, the safety inspector, of all people, should have known better.
Yeah, and I'll have my people look into that.
Oh, yeah.
By the way, you're fired.
Fired?
Nobody fires me, Shawn.
What do we do next?
I can't stop asking myself, why was the geologist's office the only door that was locked?
I'm telling you, something's in there.
We've got to get back on that rig.
But how?
I have an idea.
Is it good?
Not really.
Dad!
Whoa, whoa!
Wait!
Wait, wait!
Ah, thank God!
Hey, Shawn.
What are you doing here?
Well, hey, you know what?
Uh, Gus and I thought, maybe we'd go out with you today.
Ah, that's a first.
Every time I ask you to go out fishing, you usually come up with some lame excuse.
What was it?
Last time it was, uh, one word.
"Books.
" That's right.
What can I say?
We're both in the mood for some serious angling.
Huh?
We heard the big ones are biting.
That's funny, I heard that the storm scared all the fish away.
Wait a minute, what did you hear was biting?
It's not pike, is it?
As a matter of fact it was pike, man!
The pike is biting!
Yeah, well, pike is a fresh water fish.
In case you morons haven't noticed, that's the ocean out there.
All right, Shawn?
What's up?
What do you want?
We believe the evidence we need to solve a case is on an offshore oil rig.
It's the Bamford Number 7.
And we were hoping that you could give us a lift out there.
Can't do it.
Sorry, guys.
Even if I was so inclined, this boat isn't designed to go out that far.
Dad, come on, this is important.
It's not just about solving the case.
We gotta get back in Vick's good graces.
Shawn, cannot do it.
Shocking.
But I, uh, I think I got a friend over here.
Captain Dale might be able to help you out.
Of course, you'll have to do some chores.
Chores?
Hey, can I come in?
What do you want, Barb?
Here to argue some more about jurisdiction?
Actually, no.
Yeah, well, I have a lot of work to do, so Well, the thing is, is I had my people look into what Spencer said.
What was Hicks doing out in no man's land?
Uh, did somebody lure him there?
So I took a trip out to the rig and had a look at the crane.
And it turns out the crane had been tampered with.
Hicks was murdered.
I was wrong.
Um Spencer was right.
About Hicks murdering Renaud.
His prints were all over the murder weapon.
Well, then we need to find Spencer and see what else he's figured out.
Lead the way.
Can I?
Yeah.
Let's go.
Damn that Captain Dale.
I still smell like fish.
I hate fish.
That's not true.
You love my Cajun crawfish hush puppies.
That's mostly cornmeal and you know that!
Look what you did to my credit card!
You ruined it!
Dude, it had a 29.7% interest rate.
I did you a favor.
Stop complaining.
Start looking.
You good on litmus paper?
Huh.
What the heck is that?
Looks like a map.
"BR#7".
I don't need anybody to tell me where to dig.
Why would Renaud hand-draw a map that already existed?
You remember that map we saw in the corridor?
Yeah.
Yeah, go grab it.
That's what Renaud meant when he said they were doing something unsafe.
They're not drilling where they say they're drilling.
They're drilling directly on a fault line.
This is a private lab.
What are you two doing in here?
Dude, I got this.
Ashley, the truth is that I'm a psychic.
A damn good one, I've been told.
I'm sensing that there's stuff going on that will be hard for you to hear.
Very hard.
Very, very hard.
Damn, girl, you are so lean.
What do you, spin?
Shawn, I thought you said you got this.
Sorry.
I'm seeing faults, uh, faulty something.
Faulty intelligence?
Faulty wiring?
Fawlty Towers?
Shawn?
Fault.
Your father is drilling into a fault line.
What?
Yeah.
He made a fake map with the help of a Doctor Dre.
No, uh, Dr. Pepper, no!
Dr. No Dr. Renaud.
Renaud!
Our geologist.
That's right.
There's more.
Unfortunately, I think your father may be responsible for the deaths of Dr. Renaud and Hicks.
I think he's trying to cover his tracks.
I'm I'm sorry, I can't believe that Dad would do that.
I mean, he's always been a risk taker, willing to gamble everything if he thought there was oil to be found.
But I I can't believe that he would do this.
I feel sick.
It's okay.
We're gonna get through this together.
Probably over dinner.
I was thinking tapas, but I could be talked into Greek Shawn!
We need to stop drilling immediately.
Right.
And as far as dinner goes, let's just put a pin in it.
The communications room is down the hall.
We'll radio up to the floor and tell them to suspend operations.
The light is on the opposite wall.
I'll turn on the radio.
I know it isn't easy, hearing your father isn't who you thought he was.
But you're doing the right thing.
This is the radio room?
Ashley!
Sweetie pop!
Come on, now.
You shouldn't have come back out here, Shawn.
Now I'm gonna have to figure out a way to get rid of you.
I might have made a mistake.
She fills those jeans out quite nicely, though.
Shawn, that sign says "toxic fumes.
" I am breathing in toxic fumes!
Come on, dude.
You think the company's gonna expose their employees to stuff that's really harmful?
Did you not see Silkwood, Shawn?
They're gonna make me take a shower where they scrub my skin off!
Miss Bamford!
Can we talk to you?
Um, can it wait?
I'm really busy right now.
No, no, no, sorry, honey.
It can't wait.
See, we know that Hicks' death wasn't an accident, that he was murdered.
It looks like we have solid alibis from everyone on the rig that night.
But the helicopter pilot who brought the workers out for their shift said there was an extra passenger on board who wasn't on the manifest.
That passenger was you, Miss Bamford.
Yeah.
We're hoping you could clear this up for us.
Why were you out here that night?
And why didn't you want your name on the manifest?
Oh, well, that's simple.
I was, um You see, sometimes I like to make surprise visits.
She's got a weapon!
Halt!
We gotta get out of here.
Shawn, I think the rule is when you hear gunfire, you don't go towards it.
We're in here!
We're in here!
We're in here!
We're in here!
Oh, Jules, Lassy, thank God.
It's Ashley Bamford.
She's armed!
We know.
We're in pursuit.
You two stay put.
Do you understand?
Got it!
What part of "stay put" is confusing you?
The "put" part.
Stay put?
I wasn't put in the first place, Gus.
The expression is a complete disaster.
Ooh, look!
What's her 20?
On the left.
30 feet.
No, it's more like 35 feet.
Damn it, why do you always have to feel like you have to correct me?
Was I correcting you?
I didn't mean to correct Yeah!
I'm sorry.
What the hell are you doing?
I have a plan.
It's called "Gus is a table.
" I'm a what?
It was our signature prank in the seventh grade.
I know you remember this.
"Gus is a table.
" Let me get this Let me get this straight.
You want me to sneak up behind her on all fours, so you can push her and she'll fall over me?
Exactly.
I'll distract her while you get into position.
Ashley, hon?
Shawn?
Don't make me shoot you!
It's okay.
I just wanna talk.
I'm putting my cards on the table.
Right, smack dab on the table.
It doesn't matter.
It's too late.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, no, no.
It's not too late.
Gus is a table!
Gus is a statue!
You're a sell out?
What's going on?
What are you talking about?
Nothing.
Nothing, nothing.
Nothing's going on.
Don't come any closer, Shawn.
What is he doing?
I have no idea.
Shawn, get out of there.
Juliet, stay back.
All of you stay back.
And stop shooting!
Look, Ashley, I know what it feels like to have a Dad who does not appreciate or respect you.
Let me tell you what I see.
I see a gorgeous young woman, with a smart jacket, and an impressive education, and even more impressive arm muscle tone who desperately wanted to save her father's crumbling business.
I know that's why you had Renaud make the fake map so that nobody would know you were drilling into a dangerous fault line.
And when Butch Hicks found out about it, you did what any good child would do in your place.
You had no choice.
You had to kill him.
I couldn't let Hicks or anyone else get in the way.
You understand that, don't you, Shawn?
Of course I do.
Are you kidding me?
Completely understand, What are you doing?
Give me that.
Give me that gun.
It's okay.
Come here.
Did Barbara see that?
Well, I gotta say, Mr. Spencer, nice work.
Thanks, Chief.
No help to my table.
No help to my table.
This really isn't necessary.
I already told you guys, you're forgiven.
In fact, I should be giving you gifts for bringing my sister and me back together.
Chief, stop it.
The only gift we'll ever need from you is your sweet toothy smile.
And any possible cases you might wanna send our way.
But mostly the toothy smile.
Knock, knock, knock.
Hey!
Well, ahoy, Commander.
Welcome aboard!
There she blows!
All hands on deck.
Okay, enough.
The painfully cute mugging's starting to get on my nerves.
What are you, Entertainment Weekly?
So, we still on for lunch, Kar?
Absolutely.
This is kind of awkward, but I'm thinking of asking out Detective Lassiter.
What do you think?
Oh!
Um You don't wanna go there.
Really.
Why?
It's just, he's a little, um, wound up.
And trust me, you'd be far better off pursuing somebody else.
I'm doing you a favor.
Oh, I get it.
You want him for yourself.
What?
No.
I'm married, Barb.
And even if I weren't, I mean, Carlton?
Oh!
Oh, no.
No, no Ah, no, no, no.
No!
Oh, you are so transparent!
Transparent?
You can't stand to see me with someone you're attracted to!
All of a sudden too, by the way.
All of a Transparent?
Yeah, fine, you know what?
Ask out Lassiter!
I will!
Go ahead!
You.
Me.
Lunch.
Aye, aye!
So, I take it the sibling rivalry is back on?
Oh, it's on.
And I am so winning.
Ouch!
You have a problem.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 6}{START OF EPISODE 7}
Shawn?
Shawn!
Get in here a second.
Gus, what are you doing here?
I'm representing Shawn in this situation.
Shawn, get in here!
Take a look around.
Well, what am I looking at?
Something's missing.
I took something of yours, you need to figure out what it is.
Dad, you robbed me?
No, robbery is the taking of property by force or fear.
I'm not afraid of anyone in this room.
So you're a burglar, then?
No, Gus.
Burglary involves breaking in.
This is theft, pure and simple.
You need to figure out what it is, or you're not getting it back.
Concentrate.
You thief!
You stole my BB gun!
Technically, yes.
Theft makes me a thief.
You're learning.
So, can I have it back now?
No.
I told you not to play with it in the yard.
It's too dangerous.
But you said if I figured out what's missing, I Shawn, thieves always lie.
Remember that.
How did you even know I was playing with it in the back yard?
Mister Coburn, we are interested in anything you can tell us.
They were big and scary, these guys.
Didn't you say you didn't see them?
That's right.
Of course, they were big and scary.
Look at this place.
The man's lucky to be alive.
Carlton, I've got this.
What time did you begin your shift?
Are you the only watchman?
Yeah.
Would you mind showing me where you were standing at the time of the attack?
Yeah.
I was walking through here Spencer!
What the hell are you doing up there?
Right now, I'm putting my hand in my pocket sans thumb, pointing at an imaginary seagull.
But earlier, I got a call from the Chief.
She sounded serious.
Third break-in of its kind in as many months, no leads.
The Chief told you that?
No, she did.
She looks like the Venus de Milo, but she prefers to be called Traci, with an "I".
She saw everything.
Said I should check the videos in the surveillance room.
The mannequin told you that?
No, the Chief did.
Come on, Lassy, keep up with me here.
Gus!
I need you paying attention, do you think you can make that happen?
I only opened my book for a second, Shawn.
You know I have to study for my exam.
Right.
The RX something.
RX, Rep RX.
Pharmaceutical Rep Recertification Exam.
That is the second worst name for a test ever.
Right after the Proctological Practicum.
Well my job depends on it.
And you said you were gonna help me.
I'm not sure how I can.
You keep such sloppy notes.
What is this green slime on your book?
Did you just come from the Kids' Choice Awards?
This place is filthy.
Maybe it's a clue.
Maybe it's urine.
Smell it.
I'm not gonna smell it, are you gonna help me or not?
We've never had more than two people in this room.
It's cozy, which means I'll need everyone's hands where I can see them.
That means yours too, Chief.
Who is this?
That's our psychic, Shawn Spencer.
Psychic and treasurer of the American Wicker Council.
I'm up for re-election.
I'm running on a rattan platform.
Stuart.
This is my favorite booster, Detective Carlton Lassiter.
Would you just play the tape?
That's a lariat move.
These guys are ex-military, no question.
Oh, and that one there's calling the shots, so there appears to be a pattern here.
Well, detectives, when you know something, you can find me in my office.
Excuse me.
Ow!
Hey, Chief!
All right.
We definitely need to check out all the local paramilitary groups, the security contractors, ROTC.
Santa Barbara Ladies Auxiliary.
Huh?
Oh, they're women.
It can't be women.
This kind of thing took some kind of muscle.
It's a little shocking, isn't it?
Not as shocking as this.
These are 31s and they're really pulling through here.
Make yourself useful, get me the 32s.
I don't have time for this.
Either you have something or you don't.
Got it!
Let's go see the Chief.
You got it?
Well, let's just say I've got suspects.
Good.
Let's go and give them their names.
I've got studying to do.
How many suspects are we talking?
Mmm, give or take Really, Mr. Spencer.
It wouldn't be possible, perhaps to narrow it down just a bit, would it?
Not without help.
It's a tight group, Chief.
It's a clique.
It's a sisterhood of the Ya-Ya variety.
And it's gonna take a lot more than a smile and a pack of Pall Malls to get 'em to talk.
Not a problem.
Tough-to-crack suspects are right in my wheelhouse.
Negative.
We cannot go about this using a typical Lassiterian technique.
We need someone on the inside.
Are you saying you wanna go undercover?
Undercover?
Yes.
Me?
No.
Unfortunately, I'm not qualified for this sort of thing.
Don't worry about it, Spencer.
I've been itching to do some undercover work.
And I've got a new mustache guy.
I like where your head's at, because this is gonna take a very specific skill set.
There is only one person in this room that can pull it off.
I've just got one question.
Can you skate?
And it's looking like we're in for an excruciating jam, as Maniac cuts through the pack like a machete.
That defense had better get on the defensive, or else!
Ooh!
Look out below!
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Berman Auditorium is about to become the garden of beatin'!
And it's Miss Anthropy around the outside!
One more turn, yeah!
Don't let her through.
Don't let her through!
Pick her up!
Pick her up!
Pick her up!
Somebody pick her up!
I couldn't have called a better assignment.
Yeah, right, you're a rocket scientist.
I thought the police had a suspect from the roller derby like a month ago.
Seven, Seven Seven Deadly Cinderella.
Yeah, but it didn't go anywhere.
What did you find that got Chief Vick back onto this roller derby angle?
Oh, just everything.
The damage.
The hand signals.
The scuffmarks on the floor were caused by 62mm core composite competition skate wheels.
Vick wouldn't buy it until I threw in some roller babble.
But think about it, who better for a smash-and-grab job than an organized team?
You think they were all on wheels?
At least one of them was.
What makes you so sure it was one of these teams?
Gus, you wanna take this one?
What?
Check the schedule.
These are the only two teams who were off on all of the nights the break-ins occurred.
We call that detective work.
It's a rare and beautiful thing.
Like clubbed thumbs.
I don't know how we're gonna solve this case.
These women scare me.
Are you kidding?
It's a cake assignment.
I used to do some security work for the roller derby back in the day.
Now, those broads, they knew how to get the job done.
This is, I don't know, this is like a fashion show.
These broads, they can't, they're not And that's why we brought you down here, Pop, to hear you say "broads" repeatedly.
But why don't you explain to us how all this works?
All right, look, you see the one with the star on her helmet?
She's the lead jammer.
She scores points when she passes the opposing skaters.
All right, look at her.
Right there.
The one they call Fox?
You see, she's reaching down.
She's up to something.
You see that piece of tape?
Number 13, she's been marked.
She's gonna get hit.
She's gonna be taken down.
Watch this.
Watch it.
Here it comes.
Oh!
And there's another one for the suicide seats!
And it's happy times for Westwood, Wilde and Captain Denise "Kamikaze" Fox.
This is our only chance to snoop around, Gus.
Let's go.
Dad, you all right?
Hit her!
No, hit her now!
She's down!
He's fine.
Would you Hit!
What are we doing, Shawn?
Well, for starters, we're both growing mustaches, very, very slowly.
But we're also investigating.
This is Juliet's investigation.
We're gonna blow her cover.
We need to stay out of her way.
You're exactly right, Gus.
Or we do the exact opposite.
I vote for number two.
Be my lookout.
No, there's only a few minutes left, Shawn, and you wanna go inside Worst lookout ever.
You didn't see the girl walk in?
And I round this corner, and there's Maniac.
And I'm like, "Where'd she go"?
And she's like, "Where'd who go"?
She moves pretty good for fresh meat.
That's totally a compliment.
Where'd you learn to skate like that?
Oh, you know.
College roller skate team.
And Xanadu.
That's funny.
I get it.
Yeah.
I came around the corner, and I Dude.
You are leering.
And if by leering you mean staring oddly in a creepy way, yes.
But it's for an investigation, Gus.
They're all scraped up from burglarizing.
Burglarization?
Burglarism?
Of course they're scraped up.
It's a full-contact sport.
Uh-huh?
And since when do we get injuries underneath our elbow pads?
And that's a glass cut on the other one.
Check it out.
That's leering.
Shawn, what are you guys doing here?
I'm moving on this case.
I'm pretty sure I've found the extrasensory vortex in this building.
Where?
Women's locker room, which as it happens, is a place I've always wanted to hang out.
So it's totally a win-win.
Shawn, I get this is how you work, but this is not how we are going to be doing things.
I am lead detective, and this is first and foremost a police investigation.
So, if we are going to be partners, we are going to be doing things my way.
All kidding aside, I got some serious vibes in there.
And possibly athlete's foot.
Great, I'll check it out and come by your office later, but right now, I need you guys to get out of here!
Is this guy bothering you, Maniac?
Wilde, Fox, this is I know who this guy is, we see gawkers like him all the time around here.
Real easy to spot.
There's always one thing off about them.
Clothes.
Hair.
Teeth.
You just named my three best features.
Fourth on the list, posture.
Fifth, elocution.
ManiacManiac19, president pro tem, Maniac Fan Club.
This is my vice president, Longbranch Pennywhistle.
I'm just looking to score a little face time with the Maniac here, you know, for the blog.
Nothing I can't handle.
I was just about to give him an interview.
It was only gonna be two words.
Oh!
Okay, come on.
I'll see you tonight.
Bring the outfit.
One of us might wear it.
Get lost!
O'Hara.
Might I have a word?
In my office.
Oh, sorry, Chief.
I have to break these things in and you know how my family is cursed with bad arches, right?
Please take them off.
I was just gonna suggest that.
Later.
Did you break somebody's nose?
Yes, I did.
Thank you.
Oh!
But it was a clean hit.
It was actually more of a dislocation.
You know, it just popped right back in.
Yeah.
She curled into my wingspan so I was totally justified.
We're friends now.
She has a cat.
I'm concerned for your safety and that this might be a mistake.
No, no, no, it is not a mistake.
It's actually a very smart call.
I have found a scad of priors on my suspects.
Aggravated assault.
Battery.
Oh!
And reckless endangerment.
So, you're saying putting you in danger is a bonus?
I'm telling you I can handle myself.
I didn't want to do this in the first place.
And I'll be candid, O'Hara, you tend to dive in a little too deeply when you go undercover.
Look, Chief, first off, roller derby is better than therapy.
If I were into that sort of thing.
And secondly, these girls, they're not making any money.
Most of them are paying out of pocket and they are all the right element for this kind of behavior.
Hunches and profiles are not gonna keep this thing going.
I need concrete proof.
Soon.
And I want every single one of those suspects from that security video.
Done.
Oh, um, this is a typo, right?
$800 for skates?
Would it help if I told you the other pairs weren't cute at all?
Get me results.
Hurry.
Yeah.
This is Maniac.
Oh, yeah.
Tonight?
Yeah, I can keep it quiet.
Okay.
I'll be there.
I'm sorry I'm late.
Oh, my God.
Is there somebody here?
Are you on a date?
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I just, uh I didn't know if you would be hungry so I just I threw something together quickly.
Uh, look, we gotta get right to this.
I was just at the station and I really think I am on to something.
That's great.
We have all night to talk about it.
Gewürztraminer?
Yes.
No, no, no, no.
I can't stay.
I just got a call from one of the girls.
Are those crab cakes?
Yes, they are.
With dill and coriander.
Which girl are we talking about?
They call her Toxic Waste, but her name is Shelly.
Said she was talking to some of the other girls and that they were very impressed by me and that I am perfect for something that they have going on downtown tonight.
A "moneymaking opportunity.
" Jules, don't go.
Shawn, I ran some of their names.
They have records.
I've already eliminated Toxic Waste.
She wasn't at the break-in.
I don't think you understand.
I am undercover right now, and things can get real sticky real fast.
Sticky, how?
Shawn?
Jules, listen.
This thing that's happening tonight, it's not what you think it is.
Now, sit down.
Have some endives.
Shawn are we working together, or not?
Yes, technically, we're working together on this case.
But you know what, Jules?
I'm not feeling particularly together right now.
Then support me.
Because I really think I am on to something.
Now, I gotta go, and you're either in or you're out.
Okay, north exit, south exit.
Nobody gets out.
Yes, ma'am.
Mmm-hmm.
Jules.
You do realize we're outside of a warehouse?
That's not the point, Shawn.
Even if it's not a burglary, it's very likely some kind of peripheral criminal activity.
This place isn't like any of the others.
Look, I am really sorry I have to do this to you but Carlton?
I'll be right back.
Jules!
Spencer.
You're in the way.
Go.
All right.
We're gonna let her get in here and on her signal, we're gonna light this candle.
Cut!
Brilliant!
Beautiful!
Stand down!
Do it again!
Reset the playback, please!
A music video shoot?
I sent nearly a dozen uniformed officers, and six black-and-whites, and none of your suspects were even there.
Now, I'm gonna need a pretty damn compelling reason not to pull the plug on this one, O'Hara, because right now, we've got nothing.
It was me.
I felt a vibe.
I got a message.
You did?
Yes.
Turns out it was a major metaphysical snafu.
O'Hara said it was a non-start, I threw a tantrum.
I was crying, kicking and stamping my little feet.
I mean, they're not abnormally small.
O'Hara?
Look, Chief, I can get results.
Let me in on this.
Sure, Chief.
Lassy seems like a smart choice.
We know he's a demon on wheels and of course, he's so very good with women.
Under the circumstances, I might consider you, Carlton, but you're never more obvious than when you're undercover.
Perhaps you've forgotten the prosthetic nose debacle of 2005.
Chief, we are definitely on to something.
And last night's robbery fits the pattern we've seen between criminal activity and specific teams.
We've narrowed it down to a few suspects.
Three suspects.
Teammates, friends, pen pals.
Solid suspects.
Maybe four.
Possibly five.
Ah, six could Now, Mr. Spencer.
The idea is to have fewer suspects.
You don't get paid by the suspect.
I see us closing this by tomorrow.
Tomorrow, then.
Absolutely.
Fine, but I'm gonna need results without another incident, metaphysical or otherwise.
You're all dismissed.
Wow.
She really unloaded on us.
Thank you for taking the heat on that one, Shawn.
Jules, that's how it goes when you're partners.
If I could only count the number of times that Gus has left my cheese in the wind.
What?
Nothing.
Study on, buddy.
Arteriosclerosis.
Rosacea.
Croup.
Croup?
You'll just have to owe me one.
Or you can get me one of these bracelets.
They come in teal?
Can't do.
Can't do teal?
No.
Westwood gave it to me.
It's a roller derby thing.
You'll have to think of something else.
Fine.
You can dial back the Maniac routine.
Stop pulling rank on me.
Okay.
Ordering me around.
Fine.
And smoothies are on you until we nab someone.
I wanna figure out the next step by seeing how you work.
I wanna get close to your process, get some hard evidence.
Yeah, Shawn.
That's a good idea.
Why don't you bring her right in on your process?
Jules, here's the thing.
Close is good.
Very close is even better.
But not for this.
My process is not a tandem bike.
It's a unicycle.
Now, you belong at practice.
I can see Fox.
You gotta keep an eye on her.
That's gonna be really difficult.
She's always surrounded by Westwood and Wilde.
Perfect.
Keep an eye on them, too.
There.
The lists from Vick's desk.
And they make absolutely no sense whatsoever.
Why don't you try arranging them in alphabetical order?
That's not the point, Gus.
They stole a DVD of Spanglish.
Clearly, they weren't after the merchandise.
That's not exactly hard evidence, Shawn.
Thank you, Professor No Help.
What?
I'm sorry, did you miss that?
Maybe I should've said "MC No Help," or "Doctor Do Nothing," because you're bringing nothing to the table.
I have a test, remember?
No pass, no job.
No job, no driving you around.
Besides, you're doing perfectly fine with your new partner.
Who, Jules?
"Who, Jules"?
What?
Who do you think?
Don't be jealous.
I'm not jealous.
Don't be vexed.
You're still number one on my MySpace page.
Jules and I are just working a case together.
Nothing more.
What is this green slime on your book?
Did you just come from the Kids' Choice Awards?
This place is filthy.
Wilde was there.
What?
Cynthia "Speed Freak" Wilde was there at Zilk's during the break-in.
She uses this green oil to lubricate her skates.
Looks like she left some behind.
Good clue, buddy.
So you have Fox with the broken watch and now Wilde.
Why don't you call the cops?
According to the tapes at the store, there were at least three more.
If we don't get all of them, they're just gonna keep doing their thing.
That is the oath of thieves, Gus.
That is the code of the roller girl.
I never thought I would hear you say that.
Even more than "sinkhole sissy feet flapjack go-go boots"?
Juliet isn't answering her phone.
Mmm.
You know, those crab cakes are, like, three days old or something.
Okay, remember, Maniac, the key is to just get through the pack.
Whatever it takes.
Well, we don't want to injure anyone in practice, do we?
Of course not, but if someone's shoulder has to get dislocated, well, just make sure it isn't yours.
Back to it, boss?
Wait.
Where's Lethal Weapon?
Oh, Westwood?
She had to split a second ago.
Go visit her mother.
Let's go kick some ass.
Cool.
I'm just gonna grab something.
Okay.
See you on the track.
Westwood, hey!
Hey.
You leaving?
Yeah.
Everything okay?
Well, I have to go meet my boyfriend.
He's kinda got car trouble, so Oh!
I have to go.
Oh!
Yeah, well, uh, he's kinda stranded out on the Mesa somewhere.
Okay.
All right, well, make sure you bring him to the bout tomorrow.
Yeah, I'll try.
Yeah.
See you later.
Jules.
Shawn, I found a couple of handheld scanning machines here at the hall.
You feel anything on scanning machines?
Scanning machines?
Yeah.
For making copies.
Ah.
No, no.
Copying devices are notoriously unreliable psychic fetters.
Now, if they were three-hole punchers, different story.
Okay, well, I'm gonna look around some more, but I wanted to let you know Westwood left practice early today.
She gave me some lie, and then she just took off.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
I'm getting something now.
Street clothes, green tank top, jeans, belt Terrible, terrible belt.
Do you see her?
En mi cabeza, Jules.
I've got a psychic track on her now.
Okay, I've got to go.
Call Lassiter if you find anything out.
Of course, I'll call Lassiter.
I'm not calling Lassiter.
Follow the bouncing Westwood.
Not too close.
She's gonna see us!
Dude.
Is that What?
I think there's a body in the back of that truck.
Gus, it's not a body.
It is.
That's a hand.
Dude, this test has got you all jacked up.
You're not thinking straight.
You're too distracted trying to remember the difference between Lermacil and Hermacil.
Lermacil is for fever blisters, Hermacil is for eczema.
And what about Chermacil?
No such thing as Chermacil, Shawn.
Studying?
Sweet Fantasy Island.
That is a body.
I told you.
Not too close.
Gus, Westwood is ditching a body.
That's the break in the case that we need.
What we need is to call Lassiter like Juliet said.
And back off a little, she's gonna see us.
We're not calling Lassiter.
You know how this works.
I really have to explain it to you every single time?
You just lost Westwood.
Damn it.
Bingo.
Let's go.
I'm not going out there.
Dude, it's only gonna take a second.
You cannot sit here alone in the dark in a parked car.
You'll get picked up for mopery.
Mopery?
With intent to creep.
Trust me, it'll kick a big hole in your future.
I guess it wasn't a body.
Gus?
Well done, Spencer.
I don't know, Chief, want me to try and get her statement?
Of course, I don't speak mannequin.
Cute.
You might want to hold off on that, because we still have all the merchandise from the Zilk's burglaries.
Excellent work, Mr. Spencer.
Thanks, Chief.
It's all right.
I accept your apology.
So the burglars weren't after the merchandise.
That's right.
So what were they after?
One, two, three, four, five.
Five, four.
Four, five.
What?
I'm seeing four and I'm seeing five.
Lassy, four and five!
Nine?
The number nine?
No.
Four times five.
Minus four times four times five.
Four times four times five?
No, 20.
100 minus 80 is 20.
We all have our math facts straight, Mr. Spencer.
Is this going somewhere?
Skater number 20.
She's the one who dumped all this stuff.
That's Rita "Lethal Weapon" Westwood.
Okay, great.
We got one.
We need all of them.
Correct.
This is bigger than Westwood.
A lot bigger.
Juliet's close.
Okay.
Lassiter, let's get someone on the lookout for any more dumping sites around town.
We've got to get to Zilk's and we've gotta check something out.
If you say pants, I'm gonna sock you in your Adam's apple.
Sock you in your crotch, damn it.
Hey, it's me.
Listen, we got a situation.
What is it?
Westwood screwed up again, huge.
The cops found everything.
If they get to her she's gonna talk.
This is bad.
Yeah, and it gets worse.
Maniac's fan boy is also here.
Doing what?
He's working with the cops.
Are we compromised?
I don't know.
But after we handle Westwood, I think we need to have a talk with Maniac.
What are we doing here, Shawn?
We already know it wasn't the merchandise.
But it was something else.
Let's go.
Dude, I can't believe this.
You lifted your look right off this mannequin.
On the contrary, Shawn.
Clearly, someone is stealing my look.
Right.
I did see Tommy Hilfiger creeping from bush to bush, sketching you.
And we're moving.
But your friend can't come.
The thieves were after something in this room.
Dude.
We can't go inside there.
Read the sign.
"Laura Noid.
Employee of the month.
" You know her?
Not that one.
"Employees only.
" Gotcha.
Be my lookout.
No problem.
I'll just keep it safe and be outside.
It's okay.
It's all right.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my partner I can't believe I'm blanking.
I've done this a million times.
Nice work.
Office, Code Blue.
It's okay.
We're not here to rob you.
Well, your buddy stole the clothes right off the mannequin.
These are my clothes!
Look, we don't keep the cash back here.
This is the credit department.
We just want to talk to you about the burglary.
Oh, do you, Mannequin Man?
Well, why don't you tell that to my little can of pepper spray?
Whoa, whoa!
Hey, chill, chill, chill!
Stuart!
Shawn?
Tell her!
It's all right.
These guys are with the police.
Why is your friend dressed like the mannequin?
That mannequin is dressed like me!
Thank you.
Can we go, Shawn?
Hold up.
What were you doing over there?
Oh, uh, it's Friday.
I was shredding credit card applications.
It's the only fun thing I get to do.
The burglary happened on a Thursday.
The day before they shred the credit applications.
Thanks, guys.
It's good to see you, Stu.
Jules, I'm getting some strong messages.
Okay.
What are they?
The first one is from Keanu Reeves.
He's living in a house I built on a lake two years in the past.
How will I meet him?
The second is that the thieves were not after the merchandise.
Well, we already know that, Shawn.
They were using the hand scanners to steal information off credit card applications.
They're stealing identities.
Oh.
So then ransacking the store and stealing the merchandise was just to throw us off the trail?
Right-oh.
A handful of fake credit cards is worth more than everything in that entire store times 10.
It's a pretty brilliant plan.
Only slightly less brilliant than that YouTube video of the monkey bathing the cat.
Hey, Maniac.
We need you to come with us, Maniac.
Right now.
Jules?
Who is that?
Who's talking?
We gotta go.
So we have three suspects?
Two to go.
And you think they're on to Juliet?
I said they might be.
Either way, we're gonna find out pretty quick.
What do you think they'll do to her?
Westwood gave it to me.
It's a roller derby thing.
They may have done it already.
That's Westwood's truck.
I can't see anything.
Look for something to jimmy the lock.
Oh!
Thank God.
Thank God?
It's a dead person.
Yeah, but it's not Juliet.
It's still a human being, Shawn.
It's Westwood.
What's the matter with you?
You're saying you'd rather it be someone that we knew and care about?
Fine, next time I see Jules, I'll just tell her you wish she was dead.
I never said that I wished Juliet was dead.
Lead jammer Mrs. Bash is trapped in the pack!
Speed Freak trying to slash through Pismo's vulnerable inside line.
The Trollops are gonna have to do a 180 in the second half tonight.
Maniac!
Unless Hayseed Wannabe and Off-White Trash have their way, it might just happen.
Oh, my God.
The roller girls are on to Juliet.
Which ones?
The bad ones.
And I know who they are.
They're marking their own teammate.
They wanna hurt her.
Or worse.
Hold on to your seats We've got to do something.
Things are heating up out here, people.
I hope you brought protection.
Gus!
What are you doing?
You've been complaining about me not being any help here?
That's about to change.
They're gonna try to make a run for it, but not before they take Juliet down.
Yes, yes.
But this is a terrible idea.
I can skate, Shawn.
I got this.
What are you Now it looks like we've got a guest on the track?
Hey!
You're taking your life in your hands, pal.
Oh!
Speed Freak goes down!
There's something you don't see every day.
Man!
Shawn, watch out!
Come on, let's go!
Four suspects?
It was identity theft, Chief.
They were only after the information off the credit card applications the customers fill out.
All the stores they hit had similar credit card programs.
They break in, wreak havoc and split before the clock runs out.
Just the kind of anarchy the fans pay for night after night.
I got prints off a key piece of evidence I found here.
She got 'em when she wasn't busy kicking ass!
Huh?
Can I hear something for Maniac?
She really brought it, huh?
Am I right?
Who's with me?
Lassiter, take them away.
Whoa, whoa!
Wait!
I'm seeing the fifth suspect.
Did she get away?
No.
Rita "Lethal Weapon" Westwood.
Unfortunately, you'll find her body in her pick-up truck in the parking lot.
She's the one that botched the merchandise drop.
She paid dearly for it.
Anything else?
Um, not really.
Did I mention Juliet's roller derby awesomeness?
Huh?
Maniac.
Maniac.
Maniac.
I can't get anything from these people.
They're murderers, Shawn.
They're going away for life.
I gotta study.
Lassiter, take them away.
Ladies.
You two work together well.
I certainly think so.
We're available for more cases, by the way.
Embezzlement.
Extortion.
Espionage.
Pretty much anything that starts with "E".
Elephant theft.
I'll take that under advisement.
Elephant theft?
Oh, yeah.
People steal elephants?
Major problem.
Pretty much out of control.
Oh, hey, Jules!
What are you doing here?
I'm returning my equipment.
What are you doing here?
Just hanging.
You know, chilling.
I was actually feeling a little nostalgic.
Remember when we cracked that case here, the criminals turned out to be roller derby girls?
Yeah, I remember that.
Gosh.
Seems like it was just yesterday.
Probably because it was yesterday.
Why are you wearing skates?
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
I guess I am.
I don't know.
Uh, I guess I just thought it was a shame.
We have this big beautiful track and no one to skate on it.
It's also been a long while since I had a good blister.
Mmm.
This will be a couples skate.
Couples only.
Come on!
Shawn!
Did you do that on purpose?
No.
Maybe.
Okay, yes.
Yes, I did.
No hands.
Damn!
What is it?
It won't let me log in.
And I have to take my exam by today!
Really?
That's probably because I just took it for you.
What?
Yeah.
And I can't believe you're still using "chocolate thunder" as your password.
You took my exam?
A little harder than the river raft test, way easier than the Secret Service test.
Any of the questions I didn't know, I just answered "C".
Right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!
Dude.
It's done!
Relax.
And you know what?
Nailed it!
Well, almost nailed it.
At the very least, definitely didn't blow it.
Shawn?
I don't think.
Shawn!
Hey!
You're in.
Okay?
Sadly, you're still a pharmaceutical rep.
But, hey, whatever.
I studied for this test all week for nothing.
Yes, you did.
But that's the sort of thing that builds character.
Knowledge is power!
Don't you wanna feel powerful?
Shawn.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 7}{START OF EPISODE 8}
You're not coming in?
You're gonna make me stand in that deposit line all by myself?
No, buddy, I will be with you in spirit, like a tiny wood nymph.
Besides, what's your glitch with the ATM machine, anyway?
It's a people thing, Shawn.
Business should always be done face to face.
Well, if you remember, I'm holding a bit of a grudge against this particular banking institution.
Why, because they turned you down for a small business loan last year?
Yes, because they turned me down for a small business loan.
That was completely legitimate, Gus.
Shawn, it was for a zip-line pulley system to transport snacks from the kitchen to your desk.
Or the reception area.
What's your point?
Part of running a business together, Shawn, is sharing in the responsibilities of the business side of the business, like making deposits.
What about the bidnizz side?
'Cause I feel like I'm more of a bidnizz man.
Who's covering that?
You know what?
Fine.
I'll do it myself.
He's got a gun!
Don't anybody move!
You, go!
Now, don't anybody move!
Drop the gun!
You drop your gun!
Get over there!
Get back.
Please, sir.
Don't Don't anybody do anything.
Lassy, Jules, what are you doing here?
What are you doing here?
Shawn, we have a situation.
Some guy held up the bank and we think he's taken hostages.
Whoa!
Whoa, take it easy.
Gus is in there.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end This is Sue Ellen Jasper reporting to you live outside the Santa Barbara National Savings Bank where an as yet unnamed assailant has attempted to steal over a million dollars worth of diamonds and is now holding hostages inside.
Police are on the scene, but have yet to reveal any further details.
We'll report back to you as soon as we have more information.
You didn't see anything?
I wasn't in the bank, Jules.
Whoa!
Hold it right there.
Why didn't you go into the bank?
We came here to make a deposit.
That's not really a two-man job.
What, we both should've grabbed a corner of the check and gingerly walked it in together?
I just find it oddly un-psychic of you to have not known this was going to happen.
I don't see into the future, Jules.
I read things in the present.
And I get it.
You think I'm not kicking myself enough?
I let my best friend go in there without me and now he's stuck in there and I'm stuck out here.
Detective Lassiter, that guy could be a loose cannon.
Someone needs to go inside the bank.
O'Hara, I need you to take statements from the remaining witnesses that were outside the bank.
Got it, Chief.
Now, Detective?
Yeah.
I just want you to know that I've informed the FBI and SWAT and their chief negotiator is moments away.
No.
It's protocol and you know it.
Chief, this thing's already turning into a three-ring circus without bringing those adrenaline monkeys down here.
Look, we have a hostage situation, Detective, and I expect you to fully cooperate.
Just make a call into the bank.
See where we're at.
Maybe I can wrap this thing up here and now.
Save the city a whole lot of time and money.
Somebody needs to call into the bank!
Heads up, we're on the clock!
And cut!
Great.
Dripping with swagger.
Let's go again, though, and maybe ease up on the cocksure smile just a bit.
I liked it, I'm just not sure it's gonna play in the Midwest.
Who the hell are you?
Oh, my apologies.
I'm Shawn Spencer.
Lead psychic for the SBPD.
And dilettante of shadow puppetry.
What's this?
What's this right here?
Oh, that's a swan kissing the moon.
Well, I'm Commander Luntz, hostage negotiator, and I will thank you to step aside and let me handle things from here.
Luntz.
Lassiter.
Perhaps, as head detective, I can brief you on what's going on here.
Listen, Detective.
I don't wanna play the title game with you.
Title games?
Is that anything like Celebrity?
Because if it is, I'm gonna kick your ass.
What?
I will.
I'm really good at the game.
Little refresher, I have and am sort of an expert in human psychology and conditioning so I do know two things.
One, your friend here is acting out of a place of fear.
A little sweat on the temple, a little vibrato in the voice.
This is personal for you.
And number two, I have about 40 seconds to initiate a call into that bank before all the wheels spin off of this thing.
So, excuse me.
Boys, fire me up a call inside the bank and patch me in.
Yes, sir!
Right away.
We're not just gonna let him do this, right, Lassy?
It's protocol.
We have no choice.
Whose phone is that?
It's his phone.
Thank you, sir.
We're hostages together, we're supposed to be on the same side here.
Give me the phone.
I apologize.
I would, but it's my work phone.
And I get charged the deductible for any lost or stolen items, so how about I just turn the ringer off?
Everyone, cell phones, now!
This is Commander Luntz.
My friends call me Luntz.
You are?
That's good.
That's fine.
You don't have to say anything.
I can do all the talking for now.
I'm real good at these one-sided conversations, just ask my ex-wife.
What about you?
You married?
Get those guys away from the bank!
Tell them to get the hell back!
I can do that.
Do it now!
Well, you got to do something for me then.
That's how these things work.
What?
How about we start with a name.
You give me your name and I will back those guys so far up they'll have to put two stamps on any letter they mail to you.
How's that?
Like he's just gonna give him his name.
Phil, that's good.
I've got a nephew named Phillip.
He's a real rascal.
He's got a killer arm for an eight-year-old.
Plays right field.
What's your last name, Phil?
Get them back!
Well, I just need to know who I'm dealing with.
That's how I can help you.
Otherwise, these guys with the guns, they get really, really nervous.
So, if we get to know each other, we can be friends.
Then I can vouch for you, and I can protect you.
I protect all my friends.
Stubbins.
Stubbins.
I'm on it.
My fiancé, Michael Lenhart is in there!
He's a diabetic.
He's gonna need to eat soon.
Help him, please!
Okay, okay, just stay calm.
Hey, there's a woman over there who's hysterical.
Her fiancé is Now, look, Phil, nobody's in a rush here.
I'm in this for the long haul as long as you are, so we'll take our time, but you have a bunch of hungry people in there and you've got a young guy who's a diabetic and his fiancée is out here worried about him.
You know how women worry.
So, it would go a long way if you let me send you guys some food in there.
You like pizza?
That's because you don't understand how protocol works.
You may have gotten Guster in real trouble in there, dialing his cell phone.
At least I did something.
Look, Shawn.
He is SWAT and he is good at what he does.
I am fine with backing off here.
He's SWAT?
He's SWAT?
That's your argument?
He's not Colin Farrell.
I get that you are concerned about Gus, but I can assure you, he is in capable hands.
Hey, there's a woman over there who's hysterical.
Her fiancé is Wait a minute.
I get what's happening here.
You do?
Yes, I do.
I'm sensing a relationship here.
You are?
Yes, you and Luntz.
There's a familial thing happening.
He's like an older uncle.
What?
Are you related to him?
Not yet.
Lassiter!
What?
He's psychic.
Shouldn't he know already?
Know what?
What is he getting at?
It's nothing.
But I do know Cameron Luntz.
Commander Cameron Luntz.
Cameron?
Yes.
And he is not my uncle.
I met him at a police district conference.
He asked me out.
We went on a few dates.
I like him.
Oh, my God!
You're dating this guy?
Ding, ding, ding.
Tell him what he won, O'Hara!
Lassiter!
Look, Shawn, I was Don't Don't Don't worry.
It's fine, Jules, really.
Dare I say, dandy?
Isn't that a word from his generation?
That's not fair.
And, look, I was gonna talk to you about it earlier, but That's great.
It's really great, congratulations.
I'm so, so happy for you.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a best friend to save.
Chief, elder Commanding Officer Luntz, you need to let me get involved here.
You need to let me scope things out.
Absolutely not.
You're not a trained tactical officer, Spencer.
Are we positive he's even house trained?
Okay.
All right, maybe you and I got off on the wrong foot.
And you know what?
You're correct.
I have had a few close calls around the house recently.
But I can help you.
Oh?
How's that?
What do you know about this guy, other than his name?
We know that he's a longtime customer of this bank.
Owed a huge load of back-taxes to the IRS, just had his house foreclosed on.
And he's a middle child.
You know he's a middle child?
I can hear it in the timbre of his voice, and the fact that he doesn't use contractions, yes.
Okay, fine.
What about everyone else in the bank?
Look, you send your guy in there and what?
Maybe he gets you a guesstimate of how many hostages there are?
I can walk into that bank, I can psychically read every single hostage and Stubbins.
He's freaked out.
He won't talk to you.
He doesn't need to.
I can read his mind.
Can you read my mind right now?
'Cause it's sending a very clear message where I want you to be.
Sir!
Luntz here.
Do you think I'm stupid?
What are you talking about?
I can see what you are doing.
You are sending a cop in here with the pizzas.
Just look, Phil.
Calm down now, that's just for everybody's safety.
That's all.
Well, it is not happening.
I'll bring them up there myself if you like.
I do not think so.
You will send in a regular person.
Regular person?
Yes, a regular person.
You will send in someone from behind those barricades.
A regular person, not a cop.
What the hell is he doing?
I wouldn't accept these if I were you.
Spencer!
Just put the pizzas down and walk away.
Get out of there.
Eight pies, four of them are vegetable.
What?
Is this guy for real?
No pepperoni?
Really?
Plus the blatant disregard and utter criminal lack of ham and pineapple?
Spencer What kind of good faith negotiation is this?
I mean, this is a hostage negotiation!
Well, I don't care if you're not happy with the ingredients!
Put the pizzas down and walk away!
I won't let you accept these.
Walk away!
This is my operation!
Go get him.
Go get him out of there!
Sir.
Sir He's not going to accept the All right then, move!
Fan out!
Fan out!
Fan out!
Go, go, go, go!
Spencer!
Everybody fall back!
Terrific.
Put those pizzas down, right over there.
All right, Phil, I am just as mad about this as you are.
Why don't you let me go out there and make this right?
On the way back in, I'll have them throw in a couple of liters of old fashioned root beer and some Cinnastars.
They're like Cinnadots, they're just pointy.
They're good.
They're not great.
But I can get them, free of charge.
I'll be right back.
You're not going anywhere.
You've just become my next hostage.
Why does he keep separating everybody?
Jules is dating an old SWAT guy?
We are in a hostage situation, Shawn!
You don't get that?
I do get it.
What I don't get is the bulletproof vest over the shirt, what is that?
I'm telling you, something's not right with this guy.
I mean, he makes us take our shoes off.
Who does that?
Why?
It's a way of containing people.
You know, slowing them down and whatnot.
So we can't run away when he starts shooting us!
He's gonna start killing us off one by one.
Oh, my God!
Would you please relax?
Clearly, I have a handle on the situation.
A handle?
A handle?
You mouthed off to him and got yourself taken hostage!
Of course I did.
That was my plan all along, you sweet dollop of spicy goodness.
I had to get myself in there, so I could see what I'm dealing with.
I have this feeling that we are not dealing with the person they think we are.
Why would a bank robber keep his safety on?
So help me out.
Think.
What do you remember seeing the moment that the robbery went down?
Features?
Noses?
Maybe a chin?
I did see a chin, a beautiful one.
A glorious one.
There's a good chance she's over 100.
Are you sure you've thought this through?
Not her, Shawn!
Oh!
I've had a lot of time to think in here, Shawn.
And I've realized some things about life.
It's been two hours.
Yes, but two hours hostage time.
Things happen fast in here, Shawn.
Life is fleeting.
And I need to live it.
I need to say the things I'm feeling and act on those feelings before it's too late.
And so do you.
Okay.
In other news Phil!
Phil!
What are you What are you doing?
You wanna get yourself shot?
What?
Sorry.
Nothing!
Our bad.
You just go back to your whole robbering thing.
I need to potty.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, everyone.
I downed an Orange Julius right before I was taken captive and it went right through me.
I need to potty, okay?
I know my body, and I know my stomach, and this could get really ugly.
All right.
All right, all right.
All right, don't anybody move.
I'm watching you.
I'm just gonna be right here.
Don't move.
You know I'm not really a regular person, right, Phil?
What does that mean?
'Cause I tried once and failed.
I'm just too unique and interesting.
The French call it du fromage, which, loosely translated, means "of cheese.
" The truth is, I'm actually a psychic, a professional one.
And I am getting a major reading right in here.
You are?
There it goes again.
What?
What's it saying?
It's saying that you are a middle child.
Yes, yes, I am!
It is also saying that you are not a bank robber.
You know this?
Yes.
Very much so.
There is something else at play here, Phil.
Something nefarious and also evil.
Oh, God!
You do know!
All right!
Okay.
I can't keep up this ruse any longer.
Please, how's my wife?
Your wife?
Yes, is she scared?
Is she scared?
Uh Yes, she is scared.
Oh, my God.
Joanna, I am so sorry.
Can you, can you get a message to her?
Yes.
I believe I can, yes.
Joanna.
Joanna.
Listen, Joanna, this morning I was confronted by a man, I don't know who, and he told me that he had kidnapped you and was holding you somewhere and if I didn't walk into this bank right then and get him these diamonds and drop them in a mailbox down the road, he was gonna kill you.
I screwed up.
And I don't know how to get out of this, honey, I'm so sorry.
Oh, wow.
Phil, that was something.
I mean, it was just really jam packed with information.
It was also a little breathy.
Oddly soothing.
She said not to worry.
Everything is going to be okay.
But how?
You don't have to Okay.
But how?
I mean, I feel like I'm being watched, by the cops, but by someone in here.
Phil, I will help you, but you have to trust me.
I am working with the police department.
I know who all the players are out there.
I will get you out of this bank and I will find out where your wife is.
But you have to let me lead this negotiation.
Do you think you can do that?
I think so.
Okay, here's the plan.
First, keep up the crazy-guy routine.
We need that.
All right.
But do not speak to anyone here, unless I am with you.
Secondly, you're gonna have to give me some privacy.
I wasn't kidding about the Orange Julius.
Luntz, here.
I have some info for you.
Stubbins is not behind this.
Someone Look, Spencer, the first thing you got to realize about these guys is that they will try to manipulate anybody they can to get out of there alive.
I think that you have interfered and screwed up enough, don't you?
Why don't you find yourself a quiet little corner in there and lay low.
Copy?
But I'm telling Kenny, I need to talk to you!
Yes, sir!
What's up, sir?
Hello?
Lhasa apsos.
I have an idea that might put you back front and center on this case.
I'm listening.
Stubbins isn't behind the robbery.
Somebody kidnapped his wife and put him up to it.
Spencer, you know that sounds a little nutsy, right?
What do you have to lose?
Just send a couple black and whites out to look for the wife and see what blows back.
How can you be so sure that What was that sound?
Spencer?
Hey, McNab!
Yes, sir?
I've got something I'm gonna send you out on.
Okay.
What are we doing in the bank manager's office?
I've taken the liberty of putting together a list of demands that you can give to Luntz.
Demands?
Yup.
Yeah, we're gonna call out there and you're just gonna read these off to him.
"My demands, by Phil.
"An airplane to take me wherever I want.
"Tour bus, blue, with full tank of gas and groupies.
" That's nonnegotiable.
"$5,000 in unmarked bills.
" This is a huge list.
What if they won't get me any of this stuff?
I don't expect them to, Phil.
It's just to buy us time, so that we can figure out who in here has put you up to this.
"A zip-line pulley system used to transport deliciously flavored snacks "and such from one location to another.
" What is this?
Look, just call out to Luntz, okay?
And remember, I need to speak to him first.
What do you know about this guy, other than his name?
We know that his house was foreclosed on.
Luntz, it's Phil.
Hey there, friend.
I was wondering why I haven't heard from you.
Well, I am going to put Shawn Spencer?
Shawn Spencer on the phone.
He will be negotiating on my behalf from here on in.
No, no, Phil.
Don't do that.
That's a mistake.
This is between you and me Hey, Cam, it's Shawn.
What's up, buddy?
Spencer, put Stubbins on the phone.
Now!
Eeh, that's That's gonna be a little awkward.
I'm not really sure how to put this, and bear with me 'cause this is my first hostage negotiation.
But it would appear that I am, in fact, making the demands now.
So, why don't you go ahead and put Detective O'Hara on the phone, please.
Why in the world would I do that?
Oh, I don't know, isn't the timbre of my voice telling you why?
It's Spencer.
Shawn, are you all right?
Jules, how serious is this thing with you and Luntz, really?
I am so not having this conversation with you right now.
Is he standing next to you, sniffing your hair?
Huh?
Is he listening to me?
Shawn, half the Santa Barbara Police Department can hear us.
Okay, fine, you're right.
I'm sorry, I don't know what I was thinking.
Just answer me this.
Does he have those older guy boobies, that sort of droop at the ends?
Okay, I'm hanging up on you now.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
I'm putting Phil I'm putting Phil on for Luntz.
Hey there, buddy, you there?
Yeah.
Okay.
First, I need a plane.
Oh, gosh.
Shh.
This bank sucks.
Wait a minute, you're the bank manager.
Yes, I'm Nathaniel Gresling.
Do you recall rejecting a small business loan for a zip-line snack transportation system, calling it, and I quote, "Fiscally irresponsible"?
Shawn Yes, I do.
Well, Mr. Nathaniel Gresling, this little task of retrieving the Mini Oreos took me 14 seconds.
Zip-line?
Five.
Fiscally irresponsible?
Nay!
I call that my fiscal obligation to my shareholders, namely, Gus here.
Shawn!
Look, I'm sorry, you think that was all my decision?
I'm just a dupe for the upper management.
I don't have the power you think I do.
We understand, Mr. Gresling.
I'm still a little fuzzy on the details.
Do you remember what happened this morning, when Mr. Stubbins came into the bank?
I remember him entering the bank and he approached me.
I was busy with a customer, but he caught my attention.
He asked me to take him to the safety deposit vault, which I did.
Hmm.
Once inside the vault he drew his gun.
How do you suppose he knew about those diamonds?
The diamonds were deposited in that particular box one week prior.
I very distinctly remember Mr. Stubbins being in the bank that day.
How do you distinctly remember that?
Well, the gentleman who deposited the diamonds was a very wealthy customer, who management considers to be a VIP client.
Therefore, I'm instructed to treat him as such.
Right.
Mr. Stubbins was in the bank before to get to his safety deposit box, but I skipped him over.
That never feels good.
He was very upset.
He complained.
I felt bad for him and maybe this was my mistake, but I told him that the gentleman was depositing some very valuable merchandise.
Oh.
Therefore, he knew about the diamonds.
Right.
Don't beat yourself up, man.
It's not your fault.
Thank you very much.
God.
Nothing is agreeing with me today.
Excuse me.
I'm gonna have to take care of some more business.
Phil, buddy.
What are you doing?
They're going to meet all my demands.
Seriously?
Even the plane?
Yeah.
What about the snack line?
Yeah.
They wanted me to come take a look at the bus.
It's not blue.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
You have a shot, take it.
Negative on the target, sir.
How did you miss?
He just fell out of my scope.
Very strange.
Free hugs.
Who's next?
Well, we're still coming to you from outside the National Savings Bank where the hostage situation has escalated.
Shawn Spencer, psychic detective for the Santa Barbara Police Department, is now inside the bank.
And is not only a hostage You got to be kidding me.
he appears to be calling the shots on behalf of the now named assailant, Phillip Stubbins.
Oh, this can't be good.
Dude, don't even sit by me right now.
They already hate me for the phone thing, I don't need them to know I'm friends with the guy that kept them from being rescued.
Okay, you know something, maybe before you admonish me with that tone of voice, you'd like to hear my insanely good news.
What?
As a sign of cooperation, Phil and I are going to release a hostage, you happy now?
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!
Okay.
I knew you'd get me released!
Thank you!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Dude, it's not you.
What?
Think about it for a minute.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I'm a horrible person.
There's older people here and women.
Shawn, are you ready?
Phil, I will be with you in one minute.
What?
You are the hostage being released?
Gus I can't believe this!
I have a hunch about where Phil's wife is being held.
I think it's directly linked to a list of foreclosed houses in the area.
And I have to check it out.
Don't you see?
It's got to be me!
Just figure this out and get me out of here before there's a red laser light shining on my forehead.
And be careful, Shawn.
I will, buddy.
Oh, and, Shawn, I just want you to know that no matter what happens, I care about you and I appreciate you.
And, well, I love you, Shawn.
Okay, buddy, I hear you.
You know I'm gonna be back in like a half an hour, right?
Wow, that is a tight hug.
All right.
All right.
Okay.
Okay, I'm pretty sure Gresling is our guy.
You are?
Yeah.
This morning when you walked into the bank, you didn't find him, he found you.
His hands were quicker than your gun.
What?
Just stay away from him, say nothing.
Do not pick up the bank line.
Do not field any calls until I return.
Okay?
All right.
Shawn, I love my wife.
I know you do, man.
You did it!
All right, go get him!
All right, put him in a holding van, I wanna debrief him.
No, no.
No way, Luntz.
This is our guy, any debriefing is gonna be done by us.
No, this is my investigation.
Well, guys, guys, I appreciate you arguing over me, but let me just point out, I'm not wearing briefs.
Commander Luntz, Mr. Spencer is in our department, so we'll debrief him first, but we'll share any information that we gather.
Hands off.
Shawn!
Shawn!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Dad?
Hurry up.
What are you doing down here?
Look, I don't know what you and Gus have gotten yourselves into, but I came down here to warn you.
Warn me of what?
This guy doing the negotiating, he's done negotiating.
Meaning?
He's getting ready to take this guy out.
Yeah, Dad, I know.
He already took a shot.
Yes, but Shawn, he's getting ready to go in with tear gas.
I've seen it before.
It's not pretty.
How much time do I have?
I don't know.
Hour, tops.
All right.
Thanks, Dad.
Shawn, you be careful.
All right.
Hi, Shawn Spencer.
Thanks for coming out.
It means a lot.
Shawn!
Call me.
Look, Lassy, I am telling you that Stubbins is not behind this and I know at the very least that Gresling, the bank manager, is involved.
It's a moot point.
He's gonna do what he's gonna do.
There are hostages in there.
I know that, my best friend is one of them.
If we can get out of here and find this guy's wife, we can show that the kidnapping thing holds water.
Look, I am breaking about just by talking to you about this.
Ah, the code!
That is your biggest problem.
Oh, it's my problem?
Yeah, just once, could you grab life by the little Lassiters and follow your instincts?
I know you don't like my methods, I know you don't like me.
But we are pressed for time and I am telling you, I am vibing like crazy.
Can we screw protocol and get the hell out of here?
You take shotgun.
You are so sexy right now.
Where are you going?
I'm sorry.
But you're not the only one here who has a job to do.
Wait, are we still on for tonight?
All right, where am I driving?
Just head down to State Street.
Then you're gonna be making a left on Laporte.
Yes, left.
I'm being drawn there by the wife now.
All right, Jules, give me one good reason, why you find this guy attractive.
Shawn!
You can't give me one?
I can think of many.
Is one of them that you're looking forward to giving him sponge baths in the near future?
I happen to find his age and his maturity appealing.
He's distinguished and virile.
And most importantly, he knows who he is.
And that is attractive.
You two know I'm in the van, right?
Here!
Stop here.
This is it.
She's being held right in there.
All right, Spencer.
You stay put.
I will not be responsible for you.
O'Hara, we go on three.
You ready?
One, two Can I say it?
Let me say it.
Hey.
Shawn, get back in the car, this could be dangerous!
I will, but I have to tell you something.
Shawn, get back in the car!
Go out with Luntz.
What?
I want you to go out with Luntz.
Shawn!
What are you trying to pull?
I'm not trying to pull anything.
I just want you to be happy.
So, if you think this guy can make you happy or even if you're not sure and there's a tiny part of you that thinks that there might be a chance for that, I think you owe it to yourself to go for it.
Thank you, Shawn.
You're welcome.
When are you supposed to go out next?
Tonight, actually Wow!
That's so fast.
Where's he gonna take you?
Mario's.
Mario's?
That place is a little stuffy, don't you think?
I like their bread.
Clear!
Clear!
Split!
Spencer, what the hell are you doing?
I told you to stay in the car!
If I'd stayed in the car, I wouldn't be able to tell you that someone just took off running that way through the yard!
They're gone.
I'll call in a perimeter request, get canine down here.
You wanna help me with this gag?
Yeah.
Hello, Joanna.
I have a message from your husband.
I'm gonna try to make contact one more time and then that's it.
Prepare to go in with the gas.
You, come on.
What do you want?
Come on.
Right now.
Right now.
Why?
What do you want?
Oh!
Don't move.
Don't talk!
Look at the floor!
Look at the floor!
Come on!
Right now.
What?
Right now.
In here.
In here.
Get in there.
What?
You have my wife!
What are you talking about?
You know where she is.
Tell me where she is.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You know where she is, tell me where she is.
I swear.
You're crazy!
Where's my wife?
I don't know.
I'm gonna shoot you right now!
Where is my wife?
All right, Mrs. Stubbins, what can you tell us about the man that kidnapped you?
Well, there were actually two men.
Two?
Are you sure?
Where's my wife?
I was blindfolded, but through a crack in the bottom, I was able to make out two pairs of feet.
I didn't see much, but I know one of them was wearing a pair of brown wingtip shoes.
I got it.
The other one's in the bank.
I got to call Phil and warn him.
That's it, men, it's go time.
Hit him with the tear gas, and go in on my call.
Watch your back!
Stay there!
Hold your men!
Morgan Phelps is the second man inside the bank.
Canine caught the guy running away from the house who gave him up.
But I don't get the bank manager.
Gresling knew the bank was gonna be robbed?
He planned the whole thing from the beginning.
He knew that his VIP client had dropped off the diamonds.
The diamonds were deposited in that particular box one week prior.
He figured this was his chance to score big, so he contacted Morgan Phelps.
Who has a rap sheet as long as my arm.
So, why didn't Phelps just steal the diamonds himself?
They didn't need a professional bank robber because Gresling would basically just be handing the diamonds over.
And Phil was a perfect mark.
They could put him at the bank on the day the diamonds were delivered.
That, plus the back taxes and the recent foreclosure made him seem like a really desperate guy who needed cash in a big way.
So Phelps plants himself in the bank to make sure everything goes smoothly and then finds himself caught as a hostage when the whole deal goes sour.
I'll keep trying Luntz, but I'm pretty sure he's blocked all calls not coming from inside the bank.
We need to get back there before he goes in.
Luntz!
Have your guys grab Gresling, the bank manager.
Take him into custody.
He's in on it.
We're looking for Phelps.
Who?
Phelps.
Have you accounted for all the hostages?
We're counting bodies now.
It's a mess out here.
All right.
There's no wing tips.
Phelps is gone.
He must've taken off somewhere.
When did you last see him?
We were being held in the back room.
I know where Phelps is.
Where?
He's in the sewer.
He's in the sewer system!
That's ridiculous.
Is it, Luntz?
All right, I do know this much.
If someone were to access the sewer system out back it would dump them almost anywhere in the city.
Luntz, I'm a psychic, you're just gonna have to trust me.
Plus, listen to my voice.
It's even.
It's steady.
No vibrato.
Gus, quick!
Help me boost Lassy up to the ceiling.
Phelps is inside one of these ducts.
What?
Then what happened to the whole psychic sewer vision thing?
Lassy, do we really have time to answer these questions?
Now, come on, just give me one of those size 12 narrows.
Give me the other!
Freeze!
Come here!
I got him!
Good work, partner!
We'll grab back-up.
Partner?
Uh, excuse me?
What was that about?
Well, you got to admit, it's better than a little boy cat or a little girl cat.
Not appreciated, Shawn.
But, look at you, man, surviving a bank hostage crisis and still looking all "Poitier on a hot day.
" What?
Go ahead, slap me in the face.
Tell me they call you "Mr. Tibbs.
" I'm not doing that.
Come on, it'll make you feel better.
They call me, Mr I'm not doing that.
Look at you.
You were one word away.
Come on.
What do they call you?
Can we get in the car?
They call you, what?
They call you, Mr Jules!
Hi.
What are you Evidence turned these over to me.
I think they're Gus's shoes.
So, I just I thought I'd bring them by and drop them off.
That is very sweet of you.
You can burn them.
What?
He was devastated the whole way home.
He cried about them already, on my shoulder, like a baby.
I just put him down.
He's resting now.
So what is this?
What am I seeing here?
This is the "returning footwear to a friend" outfit?
Oh, Cameron had to cancel tonight.
No.
Yeah.
No!
Yeah, he said he took, like, four showers, but he still couldn't get that sewer smell out of his skin.
Ah!
Jeez, that damn sewer.
We wrapped everything up so nicely so that you guys could But you know what?
The man followed a hunch.
And that's all you can ask from a guy.
Hey, follow your hunches.
And he did.
I'm sorry it didn't work out for you kids.
But you gave it a real shot, a fair shot.
Shawn, I'm seeing him tomorrow night.
Really?
Wow, that's so fast on the rescheduling.
It's No conflicts either way?
Huh.
Yeah, we'll see.
Well, I should go.
Hey, have you Have you eaten?
No.
Well, I can't offer anything as fancy as Mario's, but What do you think of a Ball Park Frank and a stroll on the boardwalk?
It is golden time.
I've been told, I I look pretty good in that lighting.
Really?
It's true.
Is that right?
They plump when you cook them.
They plump?
Literally.
As the temperature rises, the wiener absorbs all additional moisture.
Causing it to double.
Sometimes even triple in diameter.
Triple?
Wow!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 8}{START OF EPISODE 9}
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's barely morning.
Just hold up.
I know you're excited, your adrenaline is rushing and your heart rate is pumping just like you got a big case and this is a hot crime scene.
Dad, I just want to see what Santa brought me.
And you will soon enough.
But first, I want you to recreate everything that went down here last night.
Santa came in, sat down, ate his milk and cookies, put the presents under the tree, then something spooked him and he ran out.
That's right.
Maybe you woke up a little earlier than he thought.
It's a pity, too, because he didn't get a chance to finish putting together your brand new bicycle.
Merry Christmas, Shawn.
What took you so long?
You know I have to get to my mom and dad's.
Choosing the perfect holiday gifts takes time, Gus.
You can't cut corners.
You have to customize, match the gift with the individual.
Look, I took our Halloween decorations and put Santa hats on them.
What do you think?
Look, can we do this later?
My sister Joy's flight gets in any minute now.
You have plenty of time.
No, I don't, Shawn.
You know she usually works during the holidays, London, Paris, Hong Kong.
Now that she's home, we have to spend as much time together as possible.
All that time away from home for work, precisely why I didn't go to law school.
Yeah, that and the school part.
Well, hello there.
May I help you?
Are you Mr. Psych?
I'm Mr. Shawn and this is Scrooge Jones.
We're psychic detectives.
Who might you be?
My name's Brittany.
Mr. Shawn, I need to hire you.
I see.
What for?
To get Santa out of jail.
All I have is $1.38.
I hope it's enough.
We couldn't possibly accept that.
He's right.
What else do you have?
The policeman dragged him away from the Santa's Village in Solvang.
Please.
You have to help him.
Don't worry, Brittany, there are some wonderful public defenders in the North Pole.
Santa will be out in no time.
But if he's not out by Christmas Eve, he can't deliver his toys.
Uh, this is This is a matter for the police.
Yes, and we never interfere with police matters.
I understand.
Okay.
Good.
Oh, boy.
What are you supposed to do when a child's crying like this?
You cave.
Brittany, Mr. Shawn and I will get Santa out as soon as we get back.
Thank you, Scrooge Jones!
Thank you, Mr. Shawn.
Let's go.
Gus!
Gus, we're back from the airport.
Hey, sis!
Oh, Gussie!
I missed you.
I missed you, too.
You don't know what it's been like not having anyone to talk to.
Well, I want to hear more about this psychic detective agency.
It's very impressive.
As we found out last year when we were both brought up on murder charges.
I still find that hard to believe.
Well, we were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Nobody to blame.
Mmm-mmm.
You two must be pretty good.
It's funny, I don't remember you being psychic.
Oh.
When did this happen?
High school.
High school.
Did you two just look at each other?
Hmm?
No.
No.
You just did it again, as if to corroborate what you were going to say.
Joy, what is this?
I mean We're not on trial here.
Joy.
It's Christmas time.
You came through the door and it's like, what?
Be merry.
It's not a courtroom.
It's not about law.
So why are you both striking defensive poses?
I was just keeping it I was keeping it loose.
Yeah.
Uh, I'm going to be late for work.
Don't forget, I'm covering the night shift.
No, Joy just got here.
Raytheon can wait.
Government planes don't make themselves yet.
It's okay, Daddy.
It'll give me and Gus a chance to catch up.
All right, well, I'll see you in the morning then.
Okay, bye.
Sweetheart, your room's all ready, and I'll just be a little longer in the kitchen.
Let me get this up to your room for you.
I doubt you need all of them.
You can get them later.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Wait a minute!
What are we doing?
What are we doing?
This This cannot happen.
I know.
It was a one-time fling I never told.
Well, thank God.
Gus would be crushed.
We're both adults, okay?
No, that's where you're wrong.
We're not adults.
You are Gus' big sister with the tassels on the handlebars of a banana seat bike, and I am Gus' best friend who put a frog on top of your head.
Listen, listen, we can't fool around, especially not in your living room.
For Gus' sake, we have to fight it!
Speak for yourself.
You know, Joy, since you're so interested in Psych, you should spend as much time with me and Shawn as possible.
Great.
This is where we do our thing, where it all goes down, where the magic happens.
Do you realize you repeat yourself when you're trying to impress someone?
Yeah, right.
Whatever.
Please.
You kind of do.
Told you so.
Touché.
You can't touché yourself.
Sure I can.
Your bad.
It's not my bad.
You can't "my bad" for someone else.
Yeah, but you ain't mad at it, though.
Know what you saying?
Will you stop it?
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster, I don't remember hiring you for a case.
Oh, we're here researching a case for another client.
Detective O'Hara's expecting us.
All three of you?
Oh, this is my sister Joy.
She's our guest.
Hi.
Um, well technically, you are guests, so that doesn't give you the right to bring your own.
I'm sorry, Chief.
Joy was just excited to see what we do.
Have you ever seen a movie about high school?
Yes.
Then you've pretty much seen what they do.
Oh, Chief, she's just a joker.
Sorry, no visitors beyond this point.
Oh, yeah.
Sure.
Wait here just a moment.
Jules, wait up.
Hey, oh, I'm sorry, I got your message.
Things have just been really hectic around here.
Something about the holidays.
Speaking of which, I'm sensing the Santa we've been looking for probably would have been brought in this morning.
Must have been that fight down at Santa's Village in Solvang we got a call about.
Yeah, we sent a paddy wagon down to assist the county.
Where are they now?
Well, unfortunately, some poor guy was knocked unconscious during the fight, so we're holding everyone in a holding cell until we can find out who's going to face assault charges.
This way.
And here we are.
Wow, he really does look like Santa.
Excuse me, sir, could you please step out of the way?
That's your Santa.
Of course it is.
Let me know if you need anything else.
Dude, our Santa only has defensive wounds.
There's no way he put anybody in a coma.
But I can tell from that guy's bracelet that he's a master of Krav Maga.
His fists are considered deadly weapons.
Since when can you read Hebrew?
Since I spent a summer working in a Hasidic deli.
Those were good times.
Shlomo.
Jules, I'm getting something here.
I'm seeing hands, fast as lightning.
It's more than a little exciting.
Kung fu fighting?
That's right.
Someone in the fight was a master of martial arts, but not Santa.
He brings peace and joy.
That's right, Gus.
The man I'm thinking of is a lethal machine trained in the martial arts of the Middle East.
Hey!
That's him!
He's the one who knocked the victim unconscious, and he's the one who should serve time for assault with a deadly weapon.
Assault?
I was minding my own business.
I only hit that guy because I was defending Santa.
Nice job, Shawn.
You just saved us hours of processing.
Well, consider it your Christmas gift.
Take him to the interrogation room, please.
And make sure this one gets back to Santa's Village to spread some Christmas cheer.
There's a very sweet little girl counting on it.
We just saved Christmas.
What?
So when the cluster of bullets is very tight, we refer to that as precision, not to be confused with accuracy which has to do with the proximity to the intended target.
What's going on here?
Just having a conversation with your delightful sister.
Really?
Ooh, let me get that for you.
Get that for you?
I know exactly what that means.
Shawn, what is the sentence for assaulting a police officer?
Whoa!
It's okay, buddy.
Sorry, Gus is a little overprotective of his older sister.
What's the deal with you and people's sisters anyway?
First Vick and now mine?
And aren't you still married?
Stand down, Guster.
We were simply having a conversation.
Jeez.
You snow white Lassie, I think Dobson is, uh, calling for you.
Really nice to meet you.
The nerve of some people.
You know, Gus, hey!
I'm a big girl, and I can see whoever I want, thank you.
No, not if that person's supposed to be a friend of mine.
Uh-uh.
Hell no.
Yeah, well, you weren't there to see its little face looking up at me meowing for milk and warmth and shelter, were you, Garth?
Fine.
Thanks.
Apparently, my apartment is infested with fleas.
May or may not have something to do with the stray cat that I took in, but they cannot blame me for infesting the entire building.
One adult female flea lays thousands of eggs.
Wow.
That's a little bit frightening.
I need some place to crash while they fumigate.
I'd stay at my dad's, but he's got some of his lodge buddies in town.
Well, Gus and I are staying with our folks for the holidays.
Why don't you stay with us?
Oh, I don't know, Joy Shawn, please.
There, it's settled.
Look.
What is it?
I saved your butt this time, Daddy!
You're lucky I didn't leave you in there to rot!
Now we only have three days left!
Don't screw up again!
Jeez, I'm sorry.
She's a little con artist.
I bet she had more than $1.38 on her, too.
Dude, we got conned on Christmas.
I don't like having my emotions toyed with like that.
Well, we ran fingerprints on everyone.
His name was Carl Wilcox, and according to police records, he is a known con man.
Now we only have three days left!
Whatever it is, they must be planning it for the 24th.
We just need to get proof.
Thank you, Jules.
You're welcome.
What?
What?
Here you go, ma'am.
Enjoy.
Ho, ho, ho, have you been good this year?
All right, so that'll be We can send them to a home address.
Just check the box.
Okay, well, you keep those grades up so that we can give you everything on your list, okay?
All right.
Who is next in line to see Santa?
Excuse us.
I don't think Santa's lap is big enough for you boys.
Cut the crap, Carl.
We know you conned us into getting you out of jail.
Okay.
Not here, all right?
Santa's going to take a five.
Be right back.
Hey, what blind kid did you steal that from?
Why would a blind kid have a videogame?
You have cooties on your face.
Shawn!
She started it.
You started it.
She gave me the stink eye.
She was playing a videogame.
She's a little Shawn.
Okay, look, guys, I really appreciate you getting me out of jail.
But I'm working, okay?
Why don't you come back, and we can have a little reindeer lunch break.
Or maybe you'd like to tell us about that little con you have planned for the 24th.
Here's the thing, Carl.
We're on to you.
Both of you.
A couple of smart guys, huh?
Maybe too smart for your own good.
This guy.
Don't hit me!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Slow down, Santa!
Not so fast, Saint Nick, huh?
International sign of guilt, buddy!
Look at those guys!
Hey, those are the same two guys I saw cut in line!
They don't even have kids!
This is not good.
All right.
Enough of you two.
Let's go.
I've never been kicked out of Santa's Village before, Shawn.
You're gonna get used to it.
I don't want to get used to it.
It's humiliating.
We still don't know what crime Carl and Brittany are planning for Christmas Eve.
Good night, guys.
Good night.
Good night, Joy.
See you in the morning.
It's like they're mocking us, you know.
It feels like a slap in the face.
Not a Rhett Butler slap, an Ike Turner slap.
Mmm.
But we still have a few days to figure it out.
Let's just go to bed.
Cool.
Good night, dude.
Good night.
This is ridiculous.
Joy!
Joy!
Joy!
Joy!
Shawn?
Mr. Guster?
You're supposed to be asleep.
What are you doing here?
I thought that I heard a noise or something.
You're supposed to be working the night shift.
What are you doing home?
I I forgot something.
Oh!
So I guess you'll be going back to work, then?
And I guess you, you'll be going back to sleep?
Why aren't you leaving?
It's my house.
I can leave when I want to!
You want to tell me what you were looking for down here?
Whoa, I'm getting something here.
You weren't at work like you said you were.
I see a projector, a movie projector.
You're not going to be reading me.
Yes.
Uh-uh.
No, no.
Oh, Mister, please No, no.
That's ridiculous.
No, stick and move.
Stick and move.
Sir, please don't do that.
I already had the vision.
It's over.
The vision's over.
I've had it.
It's done.
You lied to your family about working the night shift.
The truth is I lost my job at Raytheon a month ago.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Why are you keeping it a secret?
It's Christmas time.
Joy's home.
I didn't want everybody to worry.
So I go out on interviews all through the day and hang out at the movies or a coffee shop at night.
The family thinks I'm doing my night shift.
And this is between me and you and that lamp over there, right?
You're saying the lawn chair isn't trustworthy?
Oh, be serious, boy.
So we're cool, right?
Oh, we're cool, Mr. G. I would hate to think that things change because you betrayed my trust.
Believe me, you don't have to worry about that.
The problem is Carl already knows we're on to him.
He's not going to let us get close enough to figure out what he's up to.
Unless we're You guys ready to grab lunch?
Good idea.
You could use a pick-me-up.
I'm sorry, man.
I just, I didn't get a lot of sleep last night.
Um, unless, of course, we could figure out a way to snoop around Santa's Village without Carl knowing.
How are we going to do that?
I can help.
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.
We can use all the help we can get for the Christmas rush.
All right, enough of you two.
Let's go.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Great job!
Thank you.
Make sure you sign up for Carl's shift.
Okay.
Stay close to him.
Let us know what you find out.
We'll pick you up later.
I'm on it.
What the heck are you looking at?
That is a beautiful wreath.
I hear that.
So?
Did Carl realize you were checking up on him?
He didn't suspect a thing.
What did you find out?
I'm sorry, guys, but Carl seems like he's on the up and up.
You didn't see him talking with any shady characters?
No.
Just the kids.
And you know what?
He's a pretty good Santa.
I mean, he doesn't just ask them what they want, he asked the kids what they like most about Christmas, what they're most thankful for, what relatives they're going to visit.
It's quite touching.
So that'll be We can send them to a home address.
Just check the box.
Wait a minute, that's it.
What?
What do you see?
Are you having a vision?
It's a small, tiny vision.
Cold shower, baseball stats, watching my grandmother eat meatloaf.
Shawn!
I see Carl and Ted standing in front of a computer screen with a list of addresses, getting the information from the kids about who's traveling over the holidays, gives them a built-in list of empty houses to rob.
That's why he had to be out of jail on Christmas Eve.
We need to warn the police before tomorrow.
What the heck are you looking at?
That Look how cute the little snowman is.
I hear that.
His car is still here.
So where is Carl?
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse, much less a robber.
Really?
No one is here.
Not a single person.
Hello?
Great.
Thanks for dragging us out here for nothing, Spencer.
You're sure you sensed something was going to happen tonight?
Maybe we just missed them.
We could try to figure out which houses they were planning on robbing.
What do you start doing, just randomly knocking on doors?
We've got better things to do.
Come on, O'Hara.
How often are you wrong like this?
Not often.
Often.
As usual, they neglected to make one of the wise men black.
I thought everyone knew about Balthazar.
It's Ted.
We're not dealing with con artists.
We're dealing with murderers.
Thank you for coming, Mr. Spencer.
Now that this has become a murder case, we're amping up the investigation.
As you can imagine, the city wants people to feel safe this holiday season.
We brought Carl into custody this morning.
Brittany's in the conference room with Child Protective Services.
So far, we haven't found anything that can link Carl to the murder, so technically, we can only charge him with conspiracy to commit burglary.
But we're willing to recommend that the D.A. Cut a deal if he cooperates in the murder investigation.
Did he take it?
He says he'll only talk to you guys.
So I need to know what you can get out of him.
Let's close the book on this one pronto.
I admit it, the Santa job was just a long con to rob some people, okay.
But you've got to believe me, I could never have killed Ted.
I know.
Ted was your inside man.
I kept that from the police.
All right, Ted and I were partners for a long time.
We scammed people all up and down the coast, but we were just con men.
We never physically hurt anybody.
That wasn't our thing.
Listen, whoever it was that killed Ted might be coming after me next, or even worse, after Brittany.
I don't trust the cops to protect us.
You got to stop them.
How can we believe anything you say, Carl?
Fool us once, shame on you, fool us twice, shame on us.
Fool us thrice makes an ass out of you and me.
Nope.
We're soon parted?
That's a fool and his money.
What a fool believes?
Shawn.
Look, if they kill me, they're just going to throw Brittany back in the system.
Now, she's a tough little girl, but she's already been through a lot, all right?
And I'm all she's got.
Sorry, man.
We don't trust you as far as Gus can throw you.
Now we know where Brittany got this little trick.
Oh, dude, I think he's really crying.
Shawn, you know I can't handle it when a grown man cries.
I'm a sympathetic crier.
What?
I Ok, fine!
Fine.
We'll see what we can do, but you have to promise to cooperate fully.
Otherwise, we'll have you dragged right back in here for this Christmas con.
Deal.
Thank you.
Stop it.
Do you know who may have wanted to hurt you or Ted?
We might have kind of owed someone a little money.
How about you be a little more specific?
We were into our bookie for 10 grand.
That's why we were going to do the robberies.
Do you know where we can find this bookie?
Frank works at two bars, O'Neil's and The Wild Ox.
Sweet.
We'll have to split up.
You in the mood for Hepatitis A or C?
Excuse me.
Where is Frank?
All right.
Get me $10 on Do Not Resuscitate in the fifth race.
I don't have any cash, but give me your PayPal account, I'll make a secure deposit online.
Some kind of joke?
Maybe I should introduce myself.
Shawn Spencer, psychic detective.
I'm here to talk to you about couple of your customers, namely Carl and Ted.
Well, I hope it's about those two bums paying me the money they owe me.
It's going to be tough for Ted to pay you back, seeing as how he's dead and everything.
When did this happen?
Last night.
As if you didn't already know.
Come on, Frank, I know the game.
Somebody loses big, they can't come up with the cash, you got to send a little message.
Isn't that the code?
There's a bigger code than that.
Dead men don't pay back debts.
Injured men do.
So I'm not your guy.
Besides, there's a bar room full of witnesses who can vouch for my whereabouts last night.
Now, if you'll excuse me, a paying customer's just arrived.
Fine.
That's weird.
Mrs. G!
What in the world are you doing here?
Do you know what this guy does?
Oh, this is so embarrassing.
Um, Shawn I recently made the first and the only bet in my life.
But you're Gus's mom, for goodness sakes.
I know.
I know.
And normally, gambling isn't something that I would approve of, but Susan in accounting has this cousin Jeff, nice guy.
He knows someone who knows someone who knows Frank.
I already told you this, Frank.
I wasn't listening.
Anyway, it all seemed like fate at the time until I lost.
Oh, oh, I felt terrible and I learned a valuable lesson about the perils of gambling.
Long story short, I I lost my Christmas money.
Shawn, you have to promise not to tell my husband.
I don't want him to know about my secret vice.
Oh, Mrs. G. First of all, one time is not a vice.
It was a momentary lapse in judgment, maybe a jones.
Secondly, I am psychically detecting that Mr. Guster will not be angry with you for keeping a secret from the family.
He'll understand.
What are you guys doing up?
It's barely light outside.
Have a seat, dear.
Wow!
Christmas at my house never starts until after the football game.
Well, you're just in time to open presents.
Gee, I wonder if Santa put money in our stockings even though he knows we don't need it.
Hey, where's my Christmas money?
I was looking forward to that!
I thought you had this handled.
With me working the night shift, I didn't have time to I have been cooking, cleaning, getting the house ready.
I've been swamped.
I'm not going to lie.
Honey, I made a horrible mistake.
I know how you feel about gambling, there's no place for it in the Guster house, but I placed a bet with a bookie and I lost all my spending money.
Oh, Winnie!
Mom!
You know how to find a bookie?
I am sorry.
I am so, so sorry.
Please forgive me.
Winnie Guster placed a bet.
She Oh, honey, of course we forgive you.
Come here.
In fact, you've inspired me to come clean about something too.
I, uh I got laid off from my job a month ago.
And before you all start worrying, it's okay.
I've already got a couple of callbacks for some interviews.
I just couldn't bring myself to admit it to you guys.
Oh, Daddy.
You know you could have come to us.
Yeah, I mean, layoffs are common in this economy.
We understand.
Oh, sweetheart, you'll always be a good provider.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Hey!
Hey, you down there.
You deserve some of this.
Oh, no.
Oh, yes.
It was Shawn who helped me realize that I could trust you guys with the truth.
Yes, he was there when I needed him, too.
Come on up here, boy.
Oh, oh, okay.
Group hug!
Group hug!
What?
Um, I have something to confess, too.
Actually, Shawn and I do.
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
No, we don't.
Please.
We had a romantic tryst 10 years ago.
Just a little something something.
But with everyone's blessing, we would like to pick up where we left off.
You fooled around with my sister?
Please don't say fooled around.
That makes it sound so dirty.
One time.
Just because I'm not here doesn't make her not my sister!
Or our baby girl.
Point of information, I am not a baby.
What happened to all the love and the forgiveness from just a second ago?
Oh, my mistake wasn't this bad.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Are you implying that my mistake was worse than yours?
Because yours was a lot worse.
Excuse me, I have a job.
I knew it.
I knew it was coming.
Who loses a job after 35 years?
You see?
That's why you lost all your little money.
God don't like ugly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh, no, he didn't.
Oh, no, he did not.
Wait, wait a second.
I'm the one that should be upset here.
Everyone in here was lying to me.
Grow up.
I can't see who I want because you can't handle it.
You fooled around with my best friend.
You'll do whatever you can just to be the center of attention, won't you?
Forehead!
Ears!
What?
I'm so sorry, man.
Goodbye, Shawn!
Yeah, yeah, shrimp, I got it.
I'm coming.
I'm coming.
Hi, Dad, merry Christmas.
Hey, Shawn, I thought you were staying over at the Gusters'.
Yeah, well, I kind of, sort of ruined Christmas at that house.
What did you do this time?
Gus's sister and I sort of hooked up a while back, and for some unknown reason she announced it to the whole family, and now Gus is pissed and he's kicking people out.
Yeah, well, fooling around with your best friend's sister certainly wasn't your most brilliant idea.
No, that was the toaster alarm I invented in the third grade that woke you up by smacking you in the face with a waffle.
I think I peaked too soon.
All right, look, Shawn, of course Gus is going to overreact.
He's more than just your friend, he's your partner.
There's a special kind of trust there.
When you find out you've been lied to by your partner, you get angry.
I saw it on the force all the time.
We scammed people all up and down the coast.
Dad, that's it.
That's it!
I bet Carl and Ted have another partner.
Carl and Ted?
How many relatives do the Gusters have?
I gotta go!
I have a break in the case!
Wait Merry Christmas!
Where's the shrimp?
Yeah!
Yeah!
I'm sorry for taking you away from your family on Christmas, Jules.
Oh, it's fine.
Where's Gus?
We had a fight.
He totally overreacted.
Back in the day, his sister and I had this teeny, weenie little fling.
You're going to take his side.
I can't believe this.
I'm just saying it's a little inappropriate.
Don't worry, it was way before I knew you.
Why would that matter?
It might.
It doesn't.
It could.
It won't.
Let's carry on.
So I pulled all of Carl and Ted's court records from across the state like you said.
Your psychic sense about them was right.
Look at this.
10 years ago in Fresno, Carl and Ted turned state's evidence in an assault and robbery case.
They implicated someone named Moncrief Johnson.
See, I knew I had heard that name before, but I thought it was the black quarterback that replaced Woody Harrelson in Wildcats.
Then I remembered he was the guy who was knocked unconscious in the fight at the mall.
It was the same fight Carl was involved in.
And guess what else.
He was released from the hospital the same day that Ted's body was found at the mall.
We never physically hurt anyone.
That wasn't our thing.
I'm getting something here.
Carl and Ted turned state's evidence because he started using violence, which wasn't their M.O. Moncrief wasn't an innocent victim at the fight at the mall.
He started it.
Carl didn't realize he had gotten out of prison and was hunting them down.
But the Krav Maga expert knocked him out before he could get to Carl.
When Moncrief got out of the hospital, he picked up right where he left off.
Only this time, he didn't rely on his fists.
He's probably going to make his move before Carl can get away again.
You call Lassie.
I have to warn Carl.
Ho, ho, ho.
Moncrief Johnson, you're under arrest for the murder of Theodore Meltregger and the attempted murder of Carl Wilcox.
I think you made the naughty list.
Congratulations, Shawn.
We got him.
Thanks for believing me this time.
Thanks for saving my daddy.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
All right, folks, clear the area.
All right, you guys can come with me.
Hey, man, look.
I'm not a parent, nor an uncle, or even a godfather.
I think children are sticky.
But look, one thing's for certain, and that's that Brittany is a very smart little girl.
She's not going to be little for long.
When these times are gone, she'll be out there making her own choices.
I mean, do you really think you're teaching her to make the right choices?
Please don't.
I'm a grown man.
She's right over there.
Carl!
Thank you.
Oh, here comes your dad.
Daddy.
Come on, let's go.
What do you want?
Uh, I feel Good enough for me.
Come on in.
What is going on here?
When I left, you guys were furious with each other.
We stayed that way for a while, but we got over it.
Like we always do.
See, it's not the first time that we got mad because one of us did something stupid.
And it won't be the last.
Our rule is you can get as mad as you like, as long as you spend the same amount of energy working it out afterwards.
It took a lot of energy for us to work out how we felt about the secret the two of you were keeping.
But they got over it.
Then we realized you frustrate us the way only family can, so we decided to forgive you too.
Thanks, man.
Merry Christmas.
Oh, and as far as your sleeping arrangements, well, you don't have to go home, but you got to get the hell up out of here.
I hear that.
Say that.
Got you.
Merry Christmas, though.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.
Hey!
Oh, hey!
Hey, Shawn.
I just came by to drop off your gift.
What happened to your lodge buddies?
Oh, I made the mistake of telling Singleton his wife was getting hippy.
It was just a joke.
I didn't mean anything by it.
But tempers started to flare, the next thing you know, the room was divided into two camps, hippy and not hippy.
Needless to say, it was time to send everybody's ass home.
Wow.
I'm really sorry to hear that, Pop.
No worries because we still have our tradition to do, right?
And my winning streak is about to be extended.
Oh, my!
Did we get each other the same No.
Now, you see, I figured you'd pull a stunt like this, so mine is just a decoy.
Your real present You're so predictable, which is why I hid your real present Now, this is just uncanny.
You better not have gotten me the same iPhone I got you.
Don't be ridiculous.
I got you the Psych iPhone skin.
But, silly me, you don't have an iPhone, so I'll just keep it for my new one.
And my winning streak continues.
Merry Christmas.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 9}{START OF EPISODE 10}
Okay.
First stop is the touch pool.
Line up at the dolphin gate.
Oh, stay with your buddy.
Make sure you watch your step as you enter the aquarium.
We did it, Gus.
A year of planning's finally paid off.
Don't you think we should wait until they get a little further away?
No.
We have to move now.
We've got 10 minutes to find a dolphin, feed it, then ride it.
Plus, my dad being sick and not being able to chaperone, the fates are with us.
It's a perfect storm.
I don't want to miss the otters.
No, we won't.
Um You brought your dad's camera, right?
You're not sick.
And you're not very thorough.
How did you know?
Oh, maybe it's that snorkel hanging out of your backpack.
What kind of undercover operation are you running here, kid?
Plus, you left this behind.
If you're going to take time to create a deception, do it better.
Wait.
Dad, I'm confused.
You want me to lie to you?
No.
I want you to make it more of a challenge for me to catch you.
Because I always will.
Wait a minute.
Something's wrong.
What do you mean?
I mean this doesn't add up, Gus.
There's not really a burglary ring at a gentlemen's finishing school, is there?
I'm sorry, Shawn.
I made up the thing about the case.
I needed you to come down here to do me a favor.
Well, you know what?
This is a bad time.
My dad just got a new fishing boat and insists on taking me out to kill innocent fish.
And I can only avoid so many things at the same time.
All right.
What is it?
It's a funeral.
No.
Absolutely not.
You know I hate funerals.
They're depressing.
There's organ music, and six times out of ten, there's a snake in the casket.
We'll just go really quick.
I need someone to support me.
All right.
Who's it for?
Would you please just tell me who died?
I don't like all this secrecy, Gus.
And what's with the aquatic theme, all this Ocean Society stuff?
Did Jack Costo die?
Jacques Cousteau died in 1995.
Well, I don't think these people got the memo.
Come on, who died?
Who was it?
One of those guys?
The boat guys?
Huh?
Was there some kind of accident?
Dude, I got it.
It's the guy with the horn-rimmed glasses.
If there was ever somebody with one foot in the grave Sorry.
You know, the camera adds 10 years.
It's 10 pounds.
Shh.
Just shh.
Wait a minute.
Is this a funeral for a sea lion?
Yes.
Yes, it is.
And don't start, Shawn.
Shabby's more than just a sea lion.
He's a local hero and a heartwarming story.
I can't believe you made me put on a dress shirt for something with flippers.
The ocean is a little smaller today with the loss of this inspirational guy.
Is that Randy LaBayda?
Dude!
They got Randy LaBayda from Animal Planet.
Shh!
If sea creatures could cry, their tears would cause the water level of all the oceans of the world to rise an alarming two-and-a-half inches.
But Shabby would want us to rejoice.
I was the last person to see him alive and some people think I'm crazy to believe this, but as I returned him to his home, Sweet Mother Ocean, I thought I actually saw him wink at me.
Just how famous was this sea lion?
He's the big local story of the year.
He was rescued by the aquarium people, Shawn.
Remember?
Floating on that loose raft.
Then he died tragically after being released out into the wild.
Come and grieve.
It's a poignant story, and I need you to support me in my time of need.
You've got to be kidding me.
This is an open casket?
Shabby.
You almost made it.
But you touched our hearts and our souls.
Be free swimming in the ocean of heaven, where there are no natural predators.
Good speech.
Your turn.
You kidding me?
Shabby, buddy.
You lived a full life.
I guess.
Uh, probably balanced a beach ball on your nose At some point.
Maybe honked a horn with your mouth or barked the melody of Grand Old Flag.
Clearly, you ate very well.
Oh, no.
"Oh, no" what?
I think this sea lion was murdered.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Why do you hate me?
I don't hate you.
I'm telling you, there's something unnatural going on here.
We should go back to the aquarium to check out Shabby's cage or something.
He wasn't in an exhibit.
He was in the ocean.
He was released back into the wild three days ago.
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need to see you for a moment.
Great, now you got me kicked out of a funeral.
Nice.
Just add it to the list.
Kicked out of PetSmart.
Kicked out of Santa's Village.
Kicked out of the Salvation Army.
Dishonorably discharged.
Now, what do you mean I apologize.
He's angry because I tricked him into coming.
I am a conservationist.
I am an annual pass holder at the aquarium.
I am a registered aqua-blogger with topic-starting privileges and level three-thread management on the sea lion message boards No.
I want to know what you mean, "He was murdered.
" I'm a psychic.
I work with the SBPD.
I also make my own saltwater taffy.
Wait a minute.
What Why do you ask that?
Because I've seen some suspicious things at that aquarium.
We can't talk here.
Is there somewhere we can meet?
Yes.
Dude, what are you doing?
Cleaning up.
But why?
This place is a mess.
And it's not all the time that we have an attractive conservationist come by the office.
Oh, and by the way, I call her.
What do you mean, you call her?
You can't call a person.
Why not?
'Cause I already called her at the funeral.
You did not.
She touched me, Gus.
That's because you bumped into her.
It doesn't matter.
Contact is contact.
It's the rule, buddy.
You know what?
Get ready for battle.
"Get ready for battle"?
Come on.
Yep.
This is ridiculous.
We can't go to battle over a girl we don't know.
I'll back off.
You'll back off?
Why?
Because this is silly.
Look, you do your thing, you work it, and I'll stay out of the way.
You think I can't get a girl on my own!
Fine.
I'll back off.
I already backed off!
Too bad!
Backed off what?
Well, I was in charge of Shabby's rehabilitation.
And a lot of unexplained things happened.
First of all, they moved up the date of his release by six days.
And why did they do that?
Well, um.
Randy LaBayda.
Randy LaBayda?
From the funeral?
And Pacific Ocean Aqua Patrol.
Yeah.
I used to watch that show after wrestling practice in high school.
I was the captain.
Yeah.
Um, the aquarium did a personal appearance deal with him a couple months ago.
Put him on the ads, built a Randy LaBayda manta ray tank.
What?
And someone wanted him to be the one to release Shabby.
And you didn't want that to happen?
Well, no.
It was too soon.
Of course.
LaBayda shanghaied the whole thing.
It was supposed to be a quiet release with a local photographer.
I got to the dock, the photographer had been canceled and I wasn't even allowed on the boat.
No aquarium staff whatsoever.
I never got to see him again.
So awful.
So, uh, what happened out on the boat?
Well, no one knows.
Everyone got back late and a little upset.
Then they locked up the ship's log in LaBayda's office at the aquarium.
April, we're going to need to get into that office so that I can feel things.
I can get you in.
How soon?
Tonight.
Are you wearing sweatpants?
These are my sneaking-around pants.
Don't be jealous.
I got you a matching pair.
You're dressing up for her.
Dressing up?
Dude, I'm wearing sweats and this ridiculous lime-green jacket.
That's my lime-green jacket, Shawn.
And it's only for players.
Okay, look.
I backed off.
You need to get over it.
Okay.
This is it.
What, is there like a hidden door in the rock wall?
No.
You said you can get us in.
Yeah, I, uh, I can give you a boost.
The electrified security fence is broken here.
Oh, unless they fixed it.
You don't work here?
Well, technically no.
I did, until Tuesday.
I was asking too many questions, and LaBayda's producer, Tim, had me canned.
Which is why I asked for your help.
You want us to scale a wall?
Is it too high?
Oh, no.
No.
I could probably free jump it if the ground wasn't so wet.
You could not.
I could vault it.
Where would you land?
Okay, listen.
There's a door right on the other side of this wall.
It'll lead you straight towards LaBayda's office.
The code is 1-8-4-2.
If I'm wrong, you can just leave.
If it doesn't work, we're probably going to jail.
Yeah.
Who's first?
Come on.
See?
She's legit.
Legit?
She just boosted us over a wall.
She does have very impressive strength for a girl of her size.
Okay.
Coolest office ever.
Hello!
What's this?
Wait a minute.
Dude.
There's two laptops.
Why lock up this laptop over that one?
Why does this have a GPS on it?
It's the only software on this computer.
And it's not picking up anything.
Can we stop playing with this guy's computer and get to the ship's log, please?
Knock yourself out.
This is all wrong.
They were supposed to release Shabby near San Miguel Island.
Okay.
Where they let him off is nowhere near close to that.
Why would they do that?
We need to get out of here.
Goodbye!
Okay.
Let's get out of here.
All right.
Oh, wait, there's one more thing.
What?
I have unfinished business here.
And a date with destiny.
No.
No!
You are not swimming with the dolphins.
When are we gonna have another chance, Gus?
I don't care, Shawn.
Come on.
I'm in, I'm on it, I'm out.
Hopefully they have a harness or a small saddle of some sort.
I've charged up my camera.
You don't have to worry about the flash.
It's all digital.
Just keep on snapping.
No, we are leaving, Shawn.
I'm gonna ride that dolphin into modern history.
I'm going up top.
I'm staying here.
You're missing out on the opportunity of a lifetime!
Please.
That dolphin is not gonna ride itself.
Shawn!
Shawn, get back here!
Get out of here.
Not now!
Quiet!
Pa does not love Fa.
No, Pa does not love Fa.
You're not listening.
I'm sorry.
Stop doing that!
What the hell are you doing?
Conducting an investigation, thank you very much.
Then why do you smell like herring?
Because this is an aquarium.
You're feeding him!
We're about to go to jail and you're training dolphins?
He insisted.
I had no choice in the matter.
I said, Pa does not love Fa.
And your hands are filthy.
Do you realize how many germs you can transmit like that?
Here.
Give me that.
No.
What?
Give Here, dolphin.
You just want to feed him yourself.
I'm getting rid of the evidence.
And, yes, it's not fair that you, the person who cares less than me about marine wildlife, gets to feed them and I don't.
Just throw it and let's get out of here.
Don't make a move!
Drop the fish, sir, and nobody gets hurt.
Breaking and entering?
It was really just entering.
Climbing and entering.
We had the code.
Is that a backstage pass?
And a Dolce jacket?
I have third row center at Phil Collins tonight, and I get called back here because my department's psychic wanted to break into an aquarium to feed some fish?
That is not entirely true.
Then why were you wearing swim trunks, carrying a How To Ride a Dolphin pamphlet?
Chief, that's a long story.
The truth is we're on the trail of something.
Something big.
Something important.
Slightly sexy.
Chief, I think I can shed some light on this.
This is April McArthur.
I did it.
Yeah, um I couldn't let you guys take the fall for me.
I'm sorry, miss.
You broke into the Santa Barbara Aquarium?
Yeah, well, um.
I led them to believe that I was still an employee at the aquarium.
I got them the code for the alarm and got them into the facility.
She was also able to inexplicably lift us over a security wall.
Yeah.
Chief, she has a good reason.
She was actually acting heroically.
Thank you, Juliet.
No, thank you.
And I like those earrings.
Chief, there may have been a murder.
I can't believe poor Shabby is dead.
You, too, Jules?
Shawn, the ShabbyCam is my screen saver.
We can all learn from him.
Wait, wait, wait.
Who's Shabby?
You don't want to know.
I don't?
Yeah, probably not.
Just know I am taking lead on this case.
There is a crime at play.
Trust me.
I will straighten out these aquarium people.
They do not want to press charges at all.
They like her.
And so do I. We do not want to arrest this woman.
We need to help her.
Wow!
Well, thank you for that endorsement, O'Hara.
Now, I have to get back to the Bowl.
Somebody needs to take me, because if I miss Against All Odds, then somebody is getting fired.
I missed it?
They released you already?
Lassy, it was all a big misunderstanding.
We're working a case.
Jules is helping out.
We are solving a heinous crime.
Heinous crime?
Wait a minute.
How heinous?
Look, it's not a big deal.
There may have been a murder.
We've got it covered.
I just need a name.
I'd rather not.
Listen.
You guys don't know what I've been through these last couple weeks.
I chased down a group of diamond smugglers.
Congratulations.
Not exactly.
I chased them to an airport, where a plane was waiting for them.
Wait.
What does "Rocinante" mean to you?
A full-bodied Syrah.
A gay couple from Lisbon?
No, it was the name of their plane.
It flew off into a lightning storm.
I wanted to chase them, but apparently our helicopters only fly when there's rainbows in the sky, so they got away clean, which mean I'm officially jackass number one around here.
I need a case.
Give me the victim's name.
Shabby.
Shabby.
Is that a street name?
It's more of a given name.
Last name?
He doesn't have one.
Do not play with me.
Can I spell it?
I don't care.
T- H-E.
T- H-E S- E-A.
S -E-A L- I-O N?
Thesealion?
What is that?
French?
Pinniped.
Pinniped?
Never heard of it.
All right, description?
Black.
Black.
Height and weight?
Six, seven hundred pounds.
Jeez, Louise!
Listen, can you get a body exhumed?
Of course I can.
As long as I'm in on the autopsy.
I'm going to kill you, Spencer.
I never told you that the victim wasn't a sea lion.
Carlton, I tried to keep you out of this.
Uh, how long is this gonna take?
I don't know.
I've never examined one of these things before.
Okay, that's fair.
Are there any signs of, uh I don't know, foul play?
Well, a couple of things are odd.
I found a strange empty piercing.
Maybe he started swimming with the wrong crowd.
You didn't happen to find any tattoos, did you?
Carlton!
Well, I found some flat reef coral in the fur.
How is that possible?
Yeah!
Coral!
In the ocean!
Are you really asking that question?
A sea lion is a precision animal.
It knows how to swim around a reef without thrashing into it.
That's true.
And I found some synthetic fibers.
Okay!
What kind of fibers?
Monofilament line.
The kind found in fishing nets?
All right.
I've heard enough.
Close this thing up.
Let's go, O'Hara.
Lassy, you're not being very helpful right now.
Really?
Well, let me see if I can close this case for you right now.
Now, I'm no expert, but let me take a shot.
You've got a sea lion, and you've got a net and you've got the ocean.
You put them all together, case closed.
What?
I'm worried he might be right.
Are you serious?
I don't know, Gus.
We definitely need to see that reef.
And I know how we can get out there.
All right.
That's it, that's it.
Your hands are at ten and two.
Down there, that's your trim tab.
Over there, your heat gauge.
That's your fish finder.
GPS.
Uses waypoints, just like in a car when you find a place you like.
Look at that.
You got a little microwave down there.
Would you Shawn!
Please focus.
Look forward.
Do not become complacent just because it's water.
Dad, we're still in the dock.
Look, Shawn.
Do you wanna drive this thing or not?
I never asked that!
Isn't that right, Gus?
Yeah, I'm gonna get in the middle of that.
Man, I just wanted to come see your new boat, go out onto the reef The reef?
I'm not going out on the reef.
That place is restricted waters.
What if I told you it was for a case?
Well, that would make it worse.
What if he didn't?
Look, we won't tell anyone, okay?
We totally promise.
Plus, it'll totally solve a crime.
Shawn, would you please listen to me?
I'm not going out onto the reef.
That place is off-limits to people.
I'm not going to lose my boat, I'm not gonna lose my license to follow some stupid, lame-ass hunch of yours.
You're really not gonna budge on this?
What do you think?
Told you.
All right!
All right!
I do!
I wanna learn how to drive.
Shawn, hold up a second.
I wanna grab my tackle box.
Shawn!
Shawn!
No!
Shawn!
Don't worry, it's cool.
It's cool.
What are you doing?
Get back here!
He's gonna come after us!
No, he can't swim that fast.
Besides, he wanted me to do this.
Shawn!
He wanted you to steal his boat?
Yeah.
He didn't want to be responsible for crossing over into restricted waters.
Shawn!
Get back here!
Didn't you get that with the whole, "Shawn, Shawn, let me show you how to drive"?
I think he wanted to show you how to drive.
Yeah, so I could steal it later.
This thing's all numbers.
It's very hard to read.
Maybe it's upside down.
First of all, Shawn, that's a Thomas Guide.
Ah!
I thought it was a little land-heavy.
But look, I think the reef is down here in the corner.
A-7.
Did you listen to anything your dad said?
The map is the screen.
Gus, don't be exactly half of an 11-pound black forest ham.
That's clearly the GPS.
Exactly.
It's latitude and longitude.
You follow the degrees.
Oh, yeah?
Those numbers with the little quotation marks there?
Yes.
Dude!
I think I know where it may have gone down.
That laptop was probably tracking LaBayda's boat.
Here.
Here.
Punch this in.
zero-six, and then, uh, one of those little lines that I would use to, uh, to make a winky face in a text.
No, no, no, go back, go back.
It should be the left eye that's winking, not the right.
No Gus, pretend the person doesn't even have a right eye.
No ocular socket whatsoever.
Sutured shut.
From birth.
Shawn, I got it.
Yes!
That's it, right there.
That's good.
Okay.
Now, 50 degrees Come on, buddy!
Two degrees to the right.
No.
Up.
Two degrees up.
What do those two little dots mean again?
Kick out the lights.
Oh, dude, we're getting close.
Right on top of it.
Kick out the lights.
Why am I gonna kick out the lights?
I think I see another boat out in the distance.
Where is another boat?
It doesn't matter where, Shawn.
We're in restricted waters.
I can't get arrested twice in the same week.
You might have a few arrests in you, but I don't.
Okay.
Fine.
Did you hear something?
Like what?
Like voices.
Take him!
What?
I had this dream before, Shawn.
Ever since we saw Dead Calm.
You have to take one for the team.
What are you talking about?
Take one for the team!
But no one's gonna hurt us.
Hey, guys.
These are restricted waters.
What the heck you doing out here?
Ahoy there!
Um, yes.
Right.
Uh, my name is Shawn Spencer.
This is my first mate, Hummingbird Saltalamaccia.
Hello!
We were turned around.
Discombobulated.
We just now realized that we're in restricted waters.
Just now.
And we both have hepatitis.
I also couldn't help but notice you are not the Coast Guard.
No.
No, we thought you were the Coast Guard coming to tow us in.
Us?
Yeah.
No, no.
But does that mean that they're coming?
And if so, do you have an ETA?
No.
No idea.
We just we've been, uh, drifting for about an hour.
We stalled on our way to Monterey.
Ah!
Old Mexico.
Monterrey, Mexico is 2,000 miles inland, Shawn.
Up north.
So, what are you guys doing out here?
Oh, you know.
Just, uh, hiding from sharks.
Yeah, we heard that they can see you if your lights are on, so we kicked ours off.
Uh, that's not how sharks work at all.
Regular sharks.
Of course.
Right.
But we heard there was an infestation of genetically-altered, shark-like beasts here, in this area of the water.
They can smell the light.
They also type.
True.
What?
Not well.
But they're sharks, with fins, so it's still impressive.
Oh, and, uh, how long did you say before the Coast Guard gets here?
They're not just right around the corner or anything, are they?
I'm telling you, Gus, there's something wrong with those guys.
Did you want to stay out there and chat it up with them?
No, but we may not be the only ones out there looking for the sea lion's killer.
Uh-uh.
Maybe he didn't want me to take the boat.
I'm jumping out here.
Okay, but you're gonna get wet.
I can't believe this, Shawn.
I'm gonna get arrested two times in one week.
Okay, Dad, we have to come up with a system for unspoken actions.
I can't believe you called the cops.
I didn't call them, Shawn.
They called me.
Why?
The coroner finished his inquiry.
Found a bullet inside the sea lion.
Two.
22 slugs, actually.
He was shot?
He was murdered.
So, am I gonna need a lawyer?
'Cause mine's on a boat.
Off Cape Horn.
It might take a while.
Mister LaBayda, would you remove that bird from your shoulder?
Oh, this is an Australian hissing owl.
And I have to do a show with him in about three hours.
If I haven't bonded with him by then, he will spend the entire shoot crapping all over my Ed Hardy tee.
Now, I would appreciate it if you'd watch your tone.
'Cause this thing is like a sponge and he can get really aggressive when things get tense.
Detective, telephone.
I'm in the middle of something.
It's the FBI.
Again?
Would you tell them I didn't know they were smugglers until it was too late?
And tell them if I had access to my own plane, I could have followed the Rocinante into the storm!
Maybe you should tell them yourself.
Right.
Didn't I have her fired?
Oh!
Is that your source?
No.
Mr. LaBayda, our source is the court, as in a court-sanctioned search we did of your office.
We found animal-tracking software on your computer.
We don't tag our animals, Randy!
Once they're released into the wild, they're free.
Perhaps you'd like to explain.
I need someone to take the bird.
All right.
We were going to track him.
But it was such a great, heartwarming local story.
It would have been a great national one.
I mean you can't blame me for wanting the people to know what happened to this special creature.
Yeah.
Well, we need to know why you released him miles away from where you were supposed to.
I, uh, think I'd like to make my phone call now.
Yeah.
I bet you would.
LaBayda's Sea Adventure.
Burn the disks.
Is this you, boss?
Destroy the footage.
Take a vacation in Mexico for at least a week.
Can you do that?
I can't get to the footage right now, Chief.
Why not?
Because your two hair analysts are reviewing it right now.
I don't have a hair analyst!
Who set that up?
Oh, crap.
Get over there!
Now!
Hair analyst?
That worked?
I've always dreamed of having one myself.
I need the sunset perfectly framing the silhouette.
It has to be me and the wild.
Now, let me just say, you see a single strand of my hair out of place, let me know.
We cut right then and there.
And that includes chest hair.
Tim, you got me?
You got me?
Yeah, I got it.
All right.
Here we go.
All right.
Three What?
Freighter, freighter.
What?
No!
No!
Get out of the way!
Get your big polluting ass out of my shot!
How many boats are there gonna be?
Okay!
Perfect.
I guess this'll just have to do.
I don't like it.
I wanna go on record saying, "I don't like it.
" Gus, he's not a murderer.
He's just an egomaniac.
And for fairly good reason.
His hair is spectacular.
Swim.
Swim, my friend.
He released Shabby in the wrong place to get a better shot!
That means Shabby was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Arrivederci, my furry little Michael Phelps.
Arrivederci.
He didn't shoot him.
He didn't do it.
Yeah, pumas are pretty mean.
I know one time I ran into a puma.
Oh, man, I was Gus, look at that.
That's the same boat we saw.
The same guys!
It was five days ago.
We've been drifting for about an hour.
We stalled on our way to Monterey.
They weren't on the way to Monterey.
They were on their way to the reef.
The reef where Shabby went off the grid.
Why would they be going out there at night?
Guys?
Out of there!
Plan "A" or plan "B"?
"B".
Get out of there!
Oh, my God, I killed him!
Shawn, you can't steal your dad's boat for a second time.
Gus, you don't understand.
My dad wants me to do this.
Do I, Shawn?
You were really good with him.
So were you.
You really scared him.
And the bird.
Listen.
I don't know if this is the right time to ask, but what about Shawn?
What about him?
I don't know.
Something intriguing.
You know, odd.
It's refreshing.
I was thinking of letting him know that I'm, uh, "available.
" You know, and all that.
What do you think?
I don't know.
Is there a problem?
No.
No, there's no problem.
Your dad's getting pretty good.
Too good.
I think he's been waiting in there since Thursday.
It's pretty creepy.
And mildly impressive.
Gus.
Opportunity.
They're going that way.
We gonna follow them or not?
Uh, I'm definitely a "not" right now.
But They might be coming back.
Walking in the opposite direction.
I think this is our best opportunity.
But they're going to get help.
They're unloading stuff.
Barnacle Bill.
What Shawn!
You wanna be Hawkeye or Crow's Nest?
What do either of those mean?
I don't know.
I was hoping you did.
What is all this stuff?
GPS, radar, sonar, electronic pulse sensors.
High-tech stuff.
That's how they knew we were in the water.
Whatever they were doing, they didn't want to be found.
And they were doing it at night.
It's just a bunch of salvage equipment.
Wait a minute.
We need to get this thing off.
What are we looking for?
This thing!
This thing!
This thing!
Here.
Let me do it.
I was a Navy scout.
This is a satellite tracking tag.
What's it for?
They use it for tagging animals.
Training, research.
Well, a couple of things are odd.
I found a strange empty piercing.
Why does this have a GPS on it?
LaBayda was tracking the sea lion.
He found a bullet inside the sea lion.
Two.
22 slugs, actually.
They killed him, Shawn.
But why?
We should go.
They're coming.
They're gonna see us!
Quick!
Jump in the water.
Okay.
Hang from the anchor.
Where's the anchor?
That only works in cartoons.
Is there a shark cage?
How could that possibly be a good idea?
I don't know!
At least I'm coming up with some ideas!
I'm telling you, I saw the boat rocking.
I swear.
It's fine!
There's no one.
Everything's fine.
I saw something.
I'm telling you.
You're paranoid, man.
We're in the home stretch here.
Let's go.
Get going.
No, I'm not.
I'm checking the pull.
Dude, this is like Out of Sight, but super gay.
Don't touch me, Shawn.
Wait!
Wait!
You hear that?
Hear what?
All right.
All right.
I'm just nervous, man.
I see a flashlight.
Don't touch me, Shawn.
Wait.
What does "Rocinante" mean to you?
No.
It's the name of their airplane.
It flew off into a lightning storm.
Dude!
I solved it!
Will you be quiet?
But I solved it!
Be quiet!
Hey!
I heard it again.
Didn't you hear that?
What do you hear?
I hear birds!
Listen!
Listen!
Untie, push off.
Please.
We're going.
I think that's the engine.
I'm gonna kill you, Shawn.
Okay.
I think they're gone.
I'm gonna call for help.
No.
He'll hear you.
He has eagle ears.
Eagle ears?
Yes.
How about I send a text?
Mute your keys!
How do I do that?
Come here!
Okay, what?
What?
What's so important?
I just got a text from Shawn Spencer.
And what did it say?
It says that he solved the crime, and And what?
He's trapped in the hull of a smuggler's boat going out to sea.
What do we do with that?
"How can we find " Okay, now type the letter "U" instead Y-O-U, and you don't need that punctuation.
It's just faster.
Chief.
Dude, I really do feel so Clooney right now.
I am not Jennifer Lopez.
That was a compliment.
How is that possibly a compliment?
Did you see El Cantante?
She was amazing.
Shawn.
Shabby's transmitter.
Don't Hold on.
Get off me, Shawn.
Get off me.
Got it!
Ooh!
Ooh!
I got another text!
What does it say?
"Turn on LaBayda's laptop.
" Uh Someone get it out of evidence!
Now all we do is wait.
Gus, scratch my leg.
Just Would you just scratch my leg?
I'm not scratching.
The elastic on my sock I'm not scratching your leg, Shawn.
Can you give us a general location of the boat?
Well, it's a little bit problematic.
Well, I have my sister on ready with the Coast Guard.
Just give us the coordinates.
That's the problem.
We have a very definitive location, it just doesn't seem to make any sense.
How far out are they?
First Street and Main.
Juliet wants me to check outside.
You are not doing that.
She says we may not be where we think we are.
I trust her, Gus.
I'm gonna do it.
Shawn Shawn!
Uh, Gus?
Change of plans.
All right, let's do this quick.
I got the diamonds, we'll lose the equipment as fast as we can, we'II What the hell?
Wait a second.
This is not my boat!
My bad!
Gus, I told you, our boat is called Just Chillin'.
Just Chillin'!
Ah!
Yeah!
Inexcusable, huh?
We're sorry, and we'll be on our way.
I'm sorry you had to be here.
Apology accepted.
Get down.
Down!
Around this way.
Come on.
Towards the truck.
Now what the hell's going on here?
All right, guys, I'm just gonna be honest, 'cause that's usually the best policy.
Right?
I'm a psychic.
You're psychic?
Yeah.
So I know you guys weren't really on your way to Monterey, and I know you weren't stranded.
In fact, you were in a desperate search for the wreckage of the Rocaninante.
That was nowhere near close.
I really hate that you said that.
Do we shoot them?
I don't know yet.
You don't know yet?
Well, uh, I'll tell you what else I know.
You found your wreckage from a plane that everyone assumed escaped, but actually went down in restricted waters, which is why your booty was so tough to find.
You a cop?
We are not cops.
No, but if I was a cop, I'd be a bad cop.
That much I know.
Not because I'm tough or unscrupulous.
Because of lateness.
Just general tardiness.
Would you stop moving?
Get over here.
What's the point of this?
Unfortunately, a sweet sea lion named Shabby was innocently looking for a fish or a squid to eat What the hell is the point of this?
The point is, you saw the signal coming.
I got a hot signal coming.
What is it, a boat?
No.
It could be a diver, though.
You thought you'd been had, so You fired into the water, thinking it was a diver, but no.
I got it, whatever it was.
A sweet, innocent sea lion, attached to a beeper by a television host on the slide hoping to exploit his story for a comeback.
And when you tried to pull him out of the water, he managed to break free.
Why?
Because he was a winner, and a very strong swimmer.
And a survivor.
That's right.
At least At least for a couple of hours he was.
You're here because of a sea lion?
I'm here for all the sea lions, Jack!
And the fish, and that stuff that looks like coral but moves when you touch it.
Gus, what am I talking about?
Sea amanonees.
Don't do this to yourself.
Sea anenomies?
Yes!
Yeah, well, it's too bad you can't do anything with all that information, isn't it, now?
Yeah.
Except that Shabby left a little something behind.
And I've been doing something I like to call stalling.
And Rutger Hauer calls "shhtalling.
" Why?
Because he's Dutch.
No, why are you stalling?
Because of that.
Put it down!
Don't move!
Drop it!
All right.
Saving your ass again, Spencer?
Lassy, I believe you'll find that whatever your missing smugglers had is in that truck over there.
Diamonds?
Perhaps in the boat.
What are you talking about?
I'm helping you.
I told you.
It's a two-way street.
Hold on.
How did you A little bit of this, and a whole lot of that.
Hey!
Hi.
The case is finished, but I still have to do a little paperwork.
That's all I'm doing here.
But look at you!
Look at you!
Yeah!
First day back.
They even offered me LaBayda's office.
I said no.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
That's the worst decision anyone's ever made.
Yeah.
Listen, Shawn.
Um, I asked them for you, but they don't really allow people to ride dolphins.
But we could arrange an interaction.
That would be easy.
Yeah.
No.
No, it's okay.
I'm gonna wait.
Wait until it's natural, organic, happens in the wild Um, that's illegal.
What if I ride a whale?
I mean, what if I do the same thing, but with a whale?
That's a joke.
Of course it is.
Of course it is.
Okay.
Yeah, the, um Well, listen.
Anything else I can do, please, you really are amazing.
How about dinner?
You and me.
Mmm.
Very dark restaurant.
I'll bring some candles, in case it's too dark.
That's something I like to do.
Listen, Shawn, I, um I really would love to.
Sweet.
Uh, but, I don't want to get in the way.
Get in the way?
Yeah.
I like her, and I think you two will get there.
So, thanks for everything.
Uh, what does that even mean?
Good luck, Shawn.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 10}{START OF EPISODE 11}
Uh-uh, turn around.
Oh!
Did you get me a piñata?
Nope.
Pepsi Challenge?
Nope.
Am I being executed?
Just a little experiment.
You know, it's said that when you're deprived of one of your five senses, the other four compensate by becoming sharper.
Now, I know I usually test you on what you can see, but today I want you to tell me what you can hear.
Ready?
All right.
Tell me what you heard.
Well, you went from the fridge to the stove, then you picked something up and threw it in the trash.
Excellent.
Take off your blindfold.
Hey, my report!
You threw it in the trash?
Why?
Because it wasn't your report.
I saw you get it from Gus.
Now you're going to do the report yourself.
The next thing I want to hear is the sound of that pencil moving across your paper.
I'd rather be executed.
It's just stupid, that's all.
I mean if he didn't have any hair, no one had any business calling him Fuzzy Wuzzy.
They were being ironic, Shawn.
Yeah, but he wasn't fuzzy, was he?
No, he wasn't.
Irony, Shawn.
My point, precisely.
Hey!
Shawn.
Jules.
What are you guys doing here?
Oh, we were just out for a stroll.
Figured we'd stop in for a social call.
Plus, Gus left his retainer in the break room.
You came all the way down here in a torrential rainstorm for that?
Okay.
Truth is, we were bored.
The storm knocked out our cable.
Gus wouldn't play Boggle or Cranium.
I said I would play some Cranium.
The storm didn't knock out our cable.
Shawn didn't pay the bill.
Would have.
The storm would have knocked out our cable.
You said it yourself, Jules.
It's torrential out there.
The real reason we're down here is to pick up the check for our last case, so we can get our cable turned back on.
The weather has dampened my psychic powers, but I am sensing that something big is about to come through that door.
Huge.
We just got a call from Lassiter.
He arrested Ernesto Ramos Chavez 20 minutes ago.
He is second in command of the Cinco Reyes.
So he plays the big guitar in the mariachi band.
No, Shawn.
Cinco Reyes.
Five Kings.
They're one of the most dangerous gangs in our country.
Very good, Mr. Guster.
Lassiter busted him several years ago, but the DA couldn't make the charges stick.
So, he just dropped off the radar.
Since then we've gotten hard evidence on Chavez that links him to a whole lot of nasty stuff, enough to put him away for good.
Lassiter did a great thing today.
Hey!
He's here!
Come on, dude, this is way better than cable.
I don't know.
Ultimately, he's just another bad guy.
Book him.
Good job.
Good job.
I got a tip from an informant that Chavez had finally resurfaced.
I tracked him to the Quick Shop.
Took up position at the front door.
His only way out was through me.
The clerk said it'll take a few more minutes to process our check.
Do you mind?
The man is telling his story.
Go ahead.
So I walked up to him.
Said, "Good to see you again, Chavez.
You're coming with me.
" He said, "Just you"?
And I said, "Just me.
" Uh, just Just to be clear.
Are we talking about the Quick Shop on Las Palmas, or the one on Princeton?
What's the difference?
Well, let's say, for example, that you'd like a bag of Funyuns.
You're gonna have to go to the one on Las Palmas.
Princeton doesn't stock them.
Don't ask me why.
Who doesn't love Funyuns?
It was the one on Las Palmas, but I had more important things on my mind than chips.
Well, naturally.
You were apprehending a very dangerous criminal.
From the Cincos.
Right?
Yeah.
Reyes.
But just so you know, Funyuns aren't actually a chip.
Shawn, enough with the Funyuns.
Jules, they are an onion flavored corn snack.
And for the record, they are fun.
But that's enough from us.
We're being rude.
So how does it feel?
You guys in the gang unit couldn't catch Chavez, and Lassiter did.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Hey, he made our job easier.
Kudos, Lassiter.
Thanks, Drimmer.
Detective Lassiter, may I see you in my office?
You bet.
Probably wants to give me a commendation or something.
Probably gonna make you a Cop and 1/2.
You deserve it, Carlton.
Hey, I win, we all win.
Detective, I'd like to introduce Agents Whieldon and Rupp.
They're from the FBI National Gang Task Force.
Agents, good of you to be here.
It's been quite a night.
We choppered right in when we heard about the arrest.
Ernesto Chavez has been a high profile target for a long time.
It was just a perfect storm of good timing and even better footwork.
But you didn't have to travel all the way up here to congratulate me.
We didn't.
We're here for Chavez.
Excuse me?
We cut him a deal and he took it.
He's going to turn state's witness against the rest of the Cinco Reyes gang.
You're just gonna let them take him?
I'm sorry, Detective, but Ernesto Chavez's testimony could have a profound effect on dismantling a major criminal enterprise.
I have not devoted countless man-hours in pursuit of this scumbag to have him comfortably live out his days in some witness relocation program.
No way.
Detective, I understand your frustration.
He should be rotting in prison!
But it's not your call to make, Detective.
So, why don't you run along and fetch us our witness?
Why don't you kiss my Detective.
Combos.
Different story.
They're both pretzels and cheese.
And if you get one without cheese, that means the bag is haunted.
I should've taken him out when I had the chance.
What's that about?
Well, I've got it, but get this, the desk sergeant says that all checks must be endorsed by Chief Vick.
Relax, buddy.
No reason to get all a-thwack.
A- thwack?
That's not a word.
It's Vianessian.
That's not a language.
Chief.
Pressing matter.
Not now, Spencer.
All I need's a signature.
And a pen.
Either of you guys have a Bic?
Montblanc?
Paper Mate?
I'll take a crayon.
Agents Whieldon and Rupp, our department's psychic, Shawn Spencer.
Very impressive work, gentlemen.
It usually takes me 15 minutes to work Lassiter up into that kind of lather.
Then I rinse and repeat.
See, Gus?
I'm not the only one not paying bills.
Shots fired!
Shots fired!
Lassiter.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end He's dead.
Damn it!
Get the coroner and forensics down here right away.
What are you people staring at?
He's getting away.
You're standing over a dead man with a gun in your hand.
And?
And I'd like to know what the hell happened here!
No time for that, Chief.
Our shooter's still in the building.
Make time, Detective.
I was escorting Chavez out of his cell when the lights went off.
I was accosted from behind.
I drew my weapon, I lost it in the scuffle.
I heard a shot, the lights came on, Chavez was dead.
I had just retrieved my weapon when you arrived on the scene.
Wow, Detective.
That story is a big load of crap.
Are you calling me a liar?
Oh, you picking up on that, genius?
Detective Lassiter!
Hold me back!
Shawn, will you get serious?
Lassiter just shot a guy.
Stand down!
Don't be ridiculous.
He didn't kill anyone.
His finger wasn't even on the trigger.
Step back.
Stand down!
All of you!
Chief, I think it's obvious what went down here.
Your detective just wasted my lead witness.
And I would love to know what you're gonna do about it.
If Detective Lassiter says he's not the shooter, then I believe him.
Are you kidding me?
Thank you, Chief.
All right, everybody.
Listen up.
There's a good chance our shooter is still in the building.
O'Hara, you and I are gonna go O'Hara, take three officers and search the lower floor.
The rest of you, I want this station locked down tight.
Every window and exit covered.
Every room and air duct searched.
Move!
You.
You.
You.
We are going to follow protocol to the letter, Detective.
Now first, I need to run ballistics on your weapon.
Right.
Of course.
Got it.
Now I need a full statement from you.
In writing.
Good luck finding a pen.
All due respect, Chief, I would be a lot more useful on the search.
I wasn't asking.
Let's get out of here.
This is creeping me out.
Hold on a second.
Hey!
Where the hell are you going?
This is a crime scene!
I was looking for the bathroom.
Is that not the bathroom?
You know what?
Never mind.
I can hold it.
Unless you wanna fork over one of those evidence bags?
Give me a little privacy?
Out.
Okay.
As far as we can tell, no one has entered or exited the building since lock down.
Okay.
We've done a complete search.
And we have alibis from all staff present.
And?
Nothing.
I think it's time to have another talk with Detective Lassiter.
Don't you, Chief?
Detective.
We need to go over some things.
So, I need you to tell me again exactly what happened.
It's all right here, Chief.
Any word on the search?
Then our shooter must have gotten through our net.
We have got to expand our perimeter.
Carlton, it's not as simple as that.
Have a seat.
Ocampo?
What's Internal Affairs doing here?
Detective Lassiter.
I understand you've been going through a difficult divorce.
I also see that you've been putting in quite a lot of overtime lately.
Not to mention, you have a higher than normal incidence of discharging your weapon.
And you were overheard saying you should have taken him out when you had the chance.
Are you saying I am actually a suspect?
You've got to be kidding me.
We just need to do a gun residue swab to make sure that it wasn't you who fired the weapon.
We're just making sure.
Fine.
But I am telling you you're wasting your time.
Chief, we need to speak.
No, we don't.
The spirit world is abuzz and my psychic vibes indicate, nay, insist, that Lassiter did not shoot Chavez.
I mean, we all knew that he would shoot somebody someday.
Oh, so you think he's capable of it?
No, he doesn't.
At most Lassiter would plant evidence.
Would someone please get them the hell out of here?
I couldn't agree more.
Don't worry, buddy!
We're all over this.
Look.
I believe Lassiter is innocent, too.
But we need hard evidence to exonerate him, not visions or vibrations or whatever it is you have.
Chief, those are but two of the arrows in my psychic quiver.
You have to go by the book on this one, Chief.
We understand.
Thank you.
Oh, Chief.
One more thing.
You think you could sign this check for us?
We're a little bit broke-ish.
You think she went back inside to get a pen?
I'm still not convinced, Shawn.
How can you be absolutely certain that Lassiter didn't shoot Chavez?
It's relatively easy, Gus.
I decided to be and therefore I am.
Socrates said that.
No, that was Descartes.
That was the cologne we wore in high school.
That was Drakkar Noir.
No, that is a wine.
That's Pinot Noir.
Hello.
Chief!
Welcome!
Welcome to the Fortress of Solitude!
Coffee?
Oh, no.
No, thank you.
No, I've had enough.
No more coffee.
I've been up all night, and we still haven't found any physical evidence that this mystery shooter ever existed.
And what's worse?
Ocampo got a hold of Lassiter's psychological profile.
Wow.
He really has it out for him.
Chief, those psych evals are rarely accurate.
It was probably done by some crackpot shrink with a fake Swedish accent.
It was the one done by your mother.
Sweet Baby J. Last night you said that Lassiter is innocent.
He is.
Can you prove it?
Of course I can.
Oh, you mean right now?
Yes, now.
Ocampo has a warrant to search Lassiter's place and he's headed over there right now.
And unless you have something tangible, I don't think I can stop this train.
Chief, I think you can.
I think you can.
I think you can.
Don't worry.
I'll divine something to get Lassiter off the hook.
Let's go.
It's dedication.
It's creepy is what it is.
The lab results just came in.
I knew it.
Lassiter's hand tested positive for GSR.
Well, duh.
Lassiter always has GSR on his hands.
He practically lives at the shooting range.
You think he wants to hang around here?
And ballistics says the bullet that killed Chavez definitely came from Lassiter's gun.
All right.
This may be a little tougher than I thought.
Not for me.
Chief?
I didn't know you'd be coming by today.
I actually hadn't planned to, but Oh, no.
Detective Lassiter, you are the prime suspect in the murder of Ernesto Ramos Chavez and as of this moment you are on suspension.
Please relinquish your badge.
Here.
Let me help you with this.
Thanks.
I know you didn't do this, buddy.
And I'm gonna do everything I can to prove it.
I promise.
Hot cheese!
Dude, you know that cheese has gone bad.
Contraire, mein Herr.
It's gone good.
Very good.
Don't you know that cheese is best when it's aged?
I read somewhere that a Japanese businessman spent a fortune on a 200-year-old wheel of Jarlsberg.
I think you've confusing that with Monet's water lilies.
No, I'm pretty sure it was a Jarlsberg.
Don't you people ever clean up in here?
This place is a sty.
Lassy, what's up?
And the outfit, man.
What, are you back on the job already?
No.
These are my civvies.
They look exactly like your work clothes.
Hardly.
I'm wearing my suede bucks.
They're a casual gentleman's shoe.
A casual gentleman's shoe?
What are you, the Great Gatsby?
You gonna do a little swan watching with Daisy Buchanan later?
Wow.
How did you come up with that one?
Eighth grade summer reading.
What?
Anyway, we're glad to see you.
What are you doing here?
Well, I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you believing my innocence, especially considering how little I believe in you.
And I'm starting my own investigation and I want you on board.
You're hiring us?
Absolutely not.
Then what are you doing?
I'm giving you the chance to work with me.
But we do that all the time.
Are you gonna help me or not?
Of course we are.
You're like our brother.
Hmm!
Mmm.
Stepbrother.
Weird kid who lives down the street and who eats nothing but mayonnaise on saltines?
Please.
Have a seat.
Before we get started, we always like to ask a few preliminary questions.
Standard stuff.
Fire away.
Okay.
Well, let's see.
One, did you kill that guy?
Gus!
What?
Guys!
This is kind of a time-sensitive issue.
If I don't clear my name in the next Now I need to know your process.
How do we get started?
You really want to know my process?
Absolutely.
Usually starts with a holla and ends with a Creamsicle.
And then if there's time in between, Thundercats.
Ho-oh!
I'm dead.
The DA is already hounding me for this report.
I don't know how much longer I can hold her off.
Hounding you?
When did that happen, Ocampo?
Over drinks last night?
Look.
All I'm saying is that this is a highly sensitive case.
The sooner we clear it up, the better for all of us.
And I'm not signing off on anything until a thorough investigation is complete.
As far as I'm concerned, the pretty little DA can wait.
Hmm.
Whatever you say, Chief.
Chief, can I talk to you for a second?
Mmm-hmm.
I don't trust that guy.
Who?
Ocampo?
Neither do I. He's a snake.
Exactly.
He's a politician.
A guy like that will screw anyone for an indictment and we can't let him do that to Lassiter.
Detective, I'm handling this.
But meanwhile you have cases to work.
Chief?
He's here.
Send him in.
Look, O'Hara, you're distracted and I can't have that.
So I'm assigning you a new partner.
Drimmer?
He's one of the best detectives that I've got and he's willing to help us out.
Look, O'Hara, I know this situation is weird.
All I can do is try to be as capable as your former partner was.
Lassiter is still my partner.
Absolutely.
That didn't come out right.
You're dismissed.
Lassy, good news, we got you a grape one.
I told you I don't want a Popsicle.
Oh.
Well, I guess we'll have to share this.
How do you share a Popsicle?
I take a lick, you take a lick, I take lick, you take a lick, I take a lick It's yours.
Sweet.
Are those overnight bags?
Yeah.
I had them in my trunk.
You're staying here?
My place is a crime scene.
It's either here or I'm bunking with one of you two.
Here's fine.
Make yourself at home.
Excellent.
Now I've narrowed it down to 31 known enemies of Chavez.
All people who wanted him dead.
Now if we split the list three ways, we can get this done a lot faster.
Our objective is to do a thorough work up of every suspect to figure out who had access to the holding cell.
It's none of those guys.
Are you saying that's your method for all your investigations?
Not all of them.
Most of them.
A great many of them, yes.
I'm getting something though.
You didn't tell me everything that happened that night.
I told you everything I saw.
When you're deprived of one of your five senses, the other four compensate by becoming sharper.
Close your eyes.
Yeah.
No can do.
I never close my eyes with other people around.
Ever.
What the hell are you doing?
What the hell are you doing?
Will you relax?
Hey.
What?
Ow.
Sensory deprivation.
You told me what you saw.
Now tell me what you heard.
Right.
Well, obviously I heard the sound of my weapon going off.
No.
That's not it.
Something else.
The only other thing I heard was I heard a faint squeak.
Yahtzee.
That's it.
That's our first lead.
We go back to the cell, figure out what made that faint little squeak, and that'll lead us to our killer.
I have to say that's pretty impressive, Spencer.
Can I take this thing off now?
Yes, you may.
Great.
Let's get over there.
That sounds like the horchata guy.
What?
Guster, we kind of have other things on our plate right now.
Don't mind him.
He's out of his mind.
That's clearly the frozen yogurt guy.
Let's do this.
Whoa, whoa, Lassy.
Where do you think you're going?
I'm coming with you.
Buddy, you're under investigation.
You can't go in there.
Just stay here.
We'll be back as soon as we can.
Jules.
Hey.
What are you guys doing here?
I was guided here by the spirits.
And Gus.
The spirits told me that you're about to lead us down to the holding cells.
Gus just drove.
Absolutely not, Shawn.
As you can see, I am busy with another case.
Jules, where's your compassion?
This is Lassiter we're talking about here.
He's your comrade.
Don't you dare lecture me, Shawn.
I am more upset about this than you could ever be.
Lassiter is my partner.
How would you feel if something happened to Gus?
Depends entirely on what happened to him.
I mean if he wakes up one day and he's Howard Jones, I'm like, "Dude, things can only get better.
" He wins the US Open, I'm openly weeping in the front row of the players box between his mom and his dad.
He leaves the cake out in the rain Look, the Chief is on top of this.
She's making sure that every piece of evidence is analyzed and every person is questioned.
Even the guy who was passed out in the holding cell the other night.
Wait a second.
There was someone else down there?
Yeah.
Somebody named Kenneth Loggins.
Kenny Loggins is in jail?
The composer of House at Pooh Corner and This Is It has fallen on hard times?
No, not that Kenny Loggins.
This guy's a petty thief and a drunk.
We picked him up for vagrancy outside of Tom Blair's Pub.
He was released this morning.
Did he see anything that could help us?
More importantly, did he hear anything?
No.
Like I said, he was passed out.
Now I have to go.
Drimmer is waiting for me.
Drimmer?
Big goofy dude from upstairs?
You're working with him now?
It's only temporary.
Just till Lassiter gets reinstated.
Looks like it's stealth mode for us, partner.
Stealth mode?
Hit the jackal switch.
What is she doing with Drimmer?
Oh, my God.
She's already been assigned a new partner.
Wait.
Do you know where we're going?
I have no idea.
And he's letting her drive.
Let's just get in and out before someone catches us.
Someone like me?
I'm gonna yell for the guard unless you do what I want.
What do you want?
A friendly ear.
Gus, that's you.
I'm not giving him my ear.
Just talk to him.
But don't get too close 'cause I'm not actually sure he doesn't want one of your ears.
You talk to him.
Just go talk to him.
Why am I gonna talk to him?
'Cause I got to look around and figure out how to solve this I heard a faint squeak.
Dude, I got it!
Let's go.
Did you know that before he stabbed a guy, he was a life coach?
Who would hire him as a life coach?
The guy he stabbed.
Yeah.
We need to get out of here.
If what you said is right and Kenny Loggins saw the murder go down, why would he lie to the cops and say he didn't see anything?
Because what he saw, or more importantly who he saw, scared the hell out of him.
So Kenny Loggins knows who the real killer is.
Which means we're headed to his favorite dive.
Tom Blair's Pub?
If he wouldn't tell the cops, why do you think he'll tell us?
I have ways, Gus.
You don't have any ways, do you?
I have curds and ways.
That's Kenny Loggins.
He's dead.
So you're saying he's not all right.
Lassy?
What's up?
You totally disappeared on us.
Where did you go?
Walking.
Walking?
Where?
Around.
And you're not answering your phone?
Nothing to say.
Dude, is that my shirt?
Oh, yeah.
I spilled tapioca on mine.
Tapioca?
My tapioca?
The one with the light dusting of cinnamon on top that was in the fridge?
Yeah.
My mom made that!
Gus.
Simmer down.
Lassy, what's going on here?
Well, let's see.
My partner's moved on, my career is in shambles, and even sweet Lady Justice has abandoned me.
Bitch.
Look.
You're not done yet.
There was somebody else down there.
Yeah, Kenny Loggins.
He was passed out.
No.
No, no, no, he wasn't passed out, and I sense that he saw everything.
And someone killed him because of it.
And that someone wasn't you.
It wasn't you, was it?
Dude!
I'm just saying he's the one who disappeared from the car!
This is a huge development.
It is.
You're right.
The one person who could get me off the hook is now dead.
Thank you, Spencer.
He's seriously depressed.
Going all Bukowski on us.
I don't think we can leave him alone.
What do we do with him?
All right, look.
I don't think Lassiter killed Chavez any more than you two do, but it doesn't mean I want him camped out in my house.
For the record, I'm only 75 percent sure he didn't do it.
Gus.
What?
That's up from yesterday.
Dad, look.
The man's clearly in a bad place.
We just need you to keep an eye on him for a while.
Yeah.
Right.
He's in my kitchen breaking my "only I drink from the carton" rule.
He's a fellow cop in need of help.
Isn't that reason enough?
One day.
One day.
No more.
Thank you.
All right.
Now is this where the "you ask for my advice" part comes in?
What?
No.
Dad, please.
All right.
Look, check it out.
We know that the real killer had access to the holding cells and knew how to shut off the power.
All right.
So the janitor killed him.
No.
Dad, I think this was an inside job.
Stop right there, Shawn.
You do not throw accusations like that around.
Do you understand?
Think about it.
Kenny Loggins saw the shooter, but was too afraid to ID him.
Now who would he fear most?
Kenny Loggins was in the next cell?
What?
Was Jim Messina in there with him?
Who's Jim Messina?
A different Kenny Loggins.
Listen to me.
Under no circumstances do you go into that police station and snoop around and put yourself at risk.
Do you understand?
Yeah.
Look me in the eyes and say it.
I promise.
Good.
Now hurry up.
What?
Were you raised by wolves?
Let's go.
Where we heading?
The police station.
You just told your dad you wouldn't go there.
How long have you known me?
Now what exactly are we looking for?
Anything that connects Kenny Loggins to someone in the department.
That's weird.
What do you got?
I'm in the arrest database, and there's no record of a Kenny Loggins.
The drunkard or the gifted musician.
Huh.
That doesn't make any sense.
Jules said he was a chronic offender.
These are the hard copies of every arrest in the last year.
He should definitely be in here.
Dude.
This goes from page 29 to 32.
There's two pages missing.
Somebody must have taken it out.
Oh, man.
Now my fingers are all smudgy.
Why do I even bother with mani-pedis?
Dude.
I think somebody's here.
Act natural.
What the hell are you doing?
It's the strangest thing, Jules.
I'm having psychic spasms.
I believe the origin of these spasms is coming from inside the records room.
Oh!
Oh, that's a biggie!
I am sensing that there is something missing in here.
Something to do with Kenny Loggins.
The criminal, not the man with fabulous hair.
What are you talking about?
Ooh!
There's another one.
Oh, this is from the hips.
This is some serious business.
Here.
Look at this logbook.
I'm sensing that all the records of his arrests are gone.
These pages have been stolen.
What?
What?
What is it?
What are you getting?
I was thinking of Footloose.
When the she-welder dances over to the chair and the water comes cascading down on her.
That was Flashdance.
That was awesome is what it was.
Oh, my God.
What?
What is it?
I saw Ocampo in this office earlier.
He was shredding papers.
The IA guy.
Yeah.
It makes perfect sense.
He has big time political ambitions and taking down a high-ranking police officer would be a huge career boost for him.
The shredder's been emptied.
I think the janitor is still here.
Come on!
Let's go!
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
I'll get it.
That's dirty.
Oh, it's impossible to tell anything from these.
Not after they're all taped back up together again.
Tell me you're kidding.
I don't joke around about meticulously reassembling shredded documents, Gus.
This'll be fun.
Come on.
Like doing a puzzle, except instead of revealing a shipwreck or a kitten, we'll get our proof that Ocampo is the killer.
I'll stay here and try to trace any log-on Ocampo made to the database.
Someone's coming.
O'Hara, I finished up that paperwork for both of us.
I'm going to take off for the day.
See you around, partner.
Partner?
That's cold, Juliet.
No, he is not my partner.
He just thinks that he is my partner.
He paid for coffee, brought me cupcakes.
But trust me, my mind is 100% focused on Lassiter, just like you.
You guys are thinking about cupcakes, aren't you?
Yes.
Yes.
They're not on her desk.
Are you gonna help out or what?
Oh, Gus, I'm still cramping, man.
It's my fault.
I should've hydrated.
I cannot take it anymore!
I cannot spend one more minute with Lassiter.
He is driving me out of my mind.
What is this?
Nothing.
It's You know.
Paper.
You went down to the police station, didn't you?
I told you very specifically, "Do not go down there and poke your nose around.
" My nose is not to blame.
My feet took me there, along with Gus.
But listen.
We struck gold.
In these shreddings is the answer to who killed Kenny Loggins.
We could use an extra set of hands.
I'm out of commission.
My knuckles are swelling.
You said it was cramping.
Ow, ow!
The pain is criminal, Gus.
What do you say, Dad?
Help us out or back to Lassy?
That bad, huh?
I can't take it anymore.
He's eaten everything in my house.
He's recording every episode of Cops.
You love Cops.
Not 25 times a day.
It's got me nostalgic for the times when you were living at home.
It's nauseating.
Thanks, Dad.
Peanut guy.
You two keep at it and I'll be back before you can say, "I heart legumes.
" Wow.
You're really good at this.
It's hereditary.
I come from a long line of puzzlers, Gus.
Shawn is terrible at puzzles.
It skips a generation.
And there's a little something extra for you.
I appreciate it.
Hey, Shawn!
Out for my nightly jog.
Got to work off those cupcakes.
Right.
Well, good luck with that.
Hey, listen.
I was wondering something.
Are you and O'Hara, you know, an item?
Because she seems to talk about you an awful lot.
Really?
What is he doing out there?
He's got the nuts already.
Bring them in!
Does this say Versa Bank?
This is a credit card bill.
Yep.
So much for Shawn's theory.
Is that all he's paying for cable?
I'm getting robbed!
That's fascinating.
What else did she say?
Well, that you're very witty and urbane.
Sure.
And, also, that you're really gifted.
This psychic stuff really brings results.
So first thing I got to know is, am I going to win the lottery?
No.
I don't know.
You don't know.
I'm not.
I'm not.
I didn't think I was, anyway.
So Yeah, but more importantly, you getting anything on this Lassiter business?
Oh, man.
Now my fingers are all smudgy.
You're getting something, aren't you?
No.
No, all I got is a couple of dudes in the office jonesing for peanuts.
One of them's part elephant.
He never lets me forget that.
Well, I guess you better get back to them.
Yeah.
Good talk, Drimmer.
All right.
Hey, Shawn.
One more thing.
Yeah?
That was a cheap shot, Drimmer.
One minute, we're standing there, chatting about your creepy infatuation with Jules, and the next, I'm laying on this uncomfortable couch.
In Lassy's place, no less?
My God.
Could this get any worse?
I guess it can.
Shut up, Spencer.
You might be able to smartass your way out of some things, but you know what?
I don't see that happening here.
So you're the psychic now?
Shut up.
I like the sound of my own voice.
I won't apologize for that.
Besides, I should thank you for cold-cocking me.
You managed to shake my psychic Ju-Ju loose.
Aah!
One second.
Okay.
It was you Chavez looked at when Lassiter brought him in, because in all your years on the gang unit, the two of you became quite the BFF's.
You never brought Chavez in and you never intended to because you were on his payroll.
So how does it feel?
You guys in the gang unit couldn't catch Chavez, but Lassiter did.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Hey, he made our job easier.
Kudos, Lassiter.
Once you found out he was turning state's witness, you knew it was only a matter of time before he pointed the finger at you.
So you had to take him out.
Poor Kenny Loggins.
Well, he was just collateral damage.
One might even say he was in the danger zone.
Oh, come on, Drimmer.
That at least merited a micro-chuckle.
You really think killing me is going to solve your problems?
Oh, I'm not gonna kill you.
Juliet!
Detective O'Hara, have you seen Shawn?
No.
He's missing.
No, he isn't exactly missing.
He hasn't been gone 24 hours.
Gus is a little panicky.
Where did you last see him?
He was last outside our office, talking with your new partner.
What's his name?
Cupcake guy?
Drimmer?
That's weird.
He told me he was driving to Santa Paula to visit his mother.
Spencer, get your feet off my table.
How the hell'd you get in my place?
Drimmer?
I can't believe you thought that text was actually from me.
It lacked all nuance, my signature mocking tone, and was utterly devoid of emoticons.
Why?
Because he's in business with the Cinco Reyes.
And when you brought in Chavez, business hours were over, sweetheart.
I just became Kojak.
I always knew there was something off about you, Drimmer, but I didn't figure you for dirty.
You are one lowlife, scum-sucking bastard, aren't you?
I know how this works, Lassiter.
You're trying to throw me off with one of your stupid little insults.
Uh-uh.
Well, fellas, might as well get on with it.
What's that?
That's your suicide note.
It explains how Spencer psychically figured out that it was you.
I believe the term you're looking for is divined.
Ow!
Spencer divined it was you who killed Chavez and Loggins and he was gonna go to the Chief with it, so you shot him.
You two being former lovers and all, you were overwhelmed with guilt.
Former lovers?
Really?
It's called misinformation.
He's hoping they won't look too closely.
You are one sick twist, Drimmer.
I know.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Wait!
Wait!
Wait!
Just wait.
I'm getting something.
I'm sensing something.
Something wild.
Something in the way you look tonight.
Deep blue something.
Do you ever stop talking?
What are you doing there, Detective?
Looking for one of your spare pistols that you've hidden?
Uh-uh.
Cops found all your guns.
Hey.
Hey, stop it.
What are you doing?
Stop that!
Back off!
Stop that!
Looks like they missed one.
At least one.
There are eight and I seriously doubt they found the one in my shower or hidden in my hi-fi.
Jules.
How'd you find us?
I tracked Drimmer on his cell phone GPS.
Shawn.
Shawn, are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I think so.
Hi-fi?
Lassy, you were so cool a second ago.
Whoa!
All right.
We get our check.
Boom.
Right to the cable company.
And no chatting up Juliet.
Juliet who?
What's Lassiter doing here?
I thought he was taking some time off.
Yeah, well, he wants to see us.
Hello, Lassy.
How's our favorite exonerated murdererldirty-cop-catcher doing?
We thought you were on vacation.
I am.
This is my vacation.
Man, it is so good to have you back.
Listen, guys.
What you did for me, I can't tell you how much it means.
I mean, granted, I did save your life, but I know I wouldn't be back here if it weren't for you two.
It's okay.
We know you would've done the same for us.
Let's not go crazy.
But, look, I do have something for you.
More of a token, really.
Get out of this station.
Wow.
"Free chips with any sandwich purchase at Hal's Hoagies.
" Lassy, there aren't words.
It's the least I could do.
Yes, it is.
Oh, hey.
I do have something else for you.
Got the Chief to finally sign your check.
Sweet!
Catch you later.
Off to the cable company.
What?
No chatting up!
You promised, Shawn!
Shawn!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 11}{START OF EPISODE 12}
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Dad!
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down.
Slow down.
Fire.
You'll never believe it.
I know what I want to be when I grow up.
A fireman.
I never would have guessed.
And what exactly brought this on?
Fireman Paul.
He came to our school.
He is so totally rad.
Fireman Paul?
Did he happen to be sober?
Shawn, come here.
Listen to me.
You do not want to be a fireman.
What?
Why not?
Because you want to be a cop.
What do you think I've been teaching you all these years?
But being a fireman is the coolest.
Being a fireman is not cooler than being a cop.
But they have cooler uniforms, cooler trucks and cooler sirens.
They even get to carry axes.
Axes?
I get to carry a gun.
A real gun with real bullets.
I get to shoot bad guys.
I'm like Dirty Harry.
Can you even name a famous fireman?
Smokey the Bear?
First of all Smokey the Bear is not a fireman.
Number two, he's not real.
Number three, he's a bear.
He takes his poops in the woods.
Is that what you want?
Fireman Paul said you'd say that.
Hey, what is going on in there?
She never closes her blinds.
You know I don't like being out of the loop.
Shawn, what are you doing?
Jules.
How about an update on this blinds situation?
Oh, it's just some case with the fire department or something.
Fire department.
Did you hear that?
Of course, I did.
I'm standing two and a half feet away from her.
So what's the scoop?
Well, apparently, some building burned down last week on Benedetto under suspicious circumstances and they're looking for back up.
Sorry, guys, got to go.
Dude, that's us.
We're back up.
What?
I strongly believe Excuse us.
We're looking for the fireman.
He's probably wearing a yellow or red hard hat, maybe carrying an axe, possibly a large bucket of sand.
And a Dalmatian.
Discounting your interruption to a closed-door meeting, Ms. Conrad is the city's arson inspector.
Arson?
Hello.
Miss.
Arson.
That's fire?
Yes.
Shawn Spencer.
Head psychic, SBPD.
I'm available.
For cases as well.
Um, I'm not going to do that.
I understand.
Obsessive compulsive.
If you're finished, Mr. Spencer, we'd like to proceed with our meeting, so Ah.
How rude of me.
I'd like to look at the criminal activity for that area.
I believe her.
What?
I am sensing that Lassy is skeptical that this is arson.
Of course, I'm skeptical.
She's an arson investigator.
They always want it to be arson.
Keeps their jobs viable.
Can I go now?
All I need is access to some of your files for the last few years.
I can do that for you.
What?
Come on, Chief, I know where the file room is.
Besides, when you get down there, things can get tricky.
Some of those drawers stick.
Who gave you access to the file room?
Irrelevant.
And immaterial.
Chief, you're not going to let him do that thing where he only uses courtroom jargon, are you?
Mr. Spencer.
He is making a mockery of these proceedings.
All I'm saying is that she's making a very compelling argument.
You're an idiot.
That's less compelling.
Move to strike.
Please remove him.
Gladly.
Sidebar, Ms. Conrad.
I think I can help you.
You have no idea why I'm here.
I am sensing something happened on Benedetto Street.
You're not getting the support you want from your department.
You're looking for a little outside assistance.
That's actually spot on.
Yes, I know.
Chief, I believe we have a match made in heaven.
Holy crap.
This place is like completely burned.
It's called a fire, Shawn.
And it's all evidence, so don't touch anything.
All right, I'll try to speak slowly.
Let's review.
I believe the fire started in this general area and spread in this direction.
Conrad, what are you doing here?
Thought you were done with this site.
And this is?
Army Johnson, Fire Prevention Bureau.
And your supervisor, in case you forgot.
Well, if this is arson, then Look, at the Bureau, we have a policy of supporting our rookies.
Rookies?
So I gave you a lot of latitude on this case.
I read your report and I surveyed the scene myself.
Looks like an accidental fire to me, not malicious arson.
I respectfully disagree.
Honey, the last time this city had an arsonist was so long ago, I was still on the big red truck.
Besides, this building had no fire insurance, so no one profits.
A firebug doesn't need motive.
Yeah, enough.
Just finish your report.
Ah, now I'm late for my hot yoga class.
I'm teaching this year.
An accident?
Is there something we're missing here?
Well, we did find some empty liquor bottles and cigarette butts around the fire's point of origin, but And we've had several reports of teenagers looking for places to party.
I think Lassy's on to something.
Have we ruled out teenagers who meet in abandoned buildings and make bananas foster?
It is not teenagers.
One of the firemen remembers smelling a distinct sweet odor while putting out the fire, and that is a sign of a stronger accelerant than alcohol.
And if this is a firebug, he is just getting started.
Dude, that wall over there doesn't have any insulation.
I think that's an external wall.
Look, if no one from your department is on board.
I'm on board.
Gus, what's happening to me?
What the hell are you doing?
There's something up with this wall right here.
I can feel it.
Oh, my God!
What the Did not see that coming.
Hmm.
Miss Conrad, this wasn't just arson.
It was murder.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I am sensing that this man Is it a man?
I don't know.
I don't know what it is.
Yes.
Based on the pelvic girdle.
Burned to death.
Hell of a way to go.
He didn't burn to death.
ME pulled a. 22 slug out of his sternum.
He was shot, then burned?
It's sad.
But that's what they do to guys who wear girdles.
This man is the reason the fire was set.
According to the ME's preliminary report, "The bullet entered the body "at a downward trajectory based on bone fragments containing lead residue.
" Let's see, from behind and downward, means our shooter got the victim on his knees, popped him execution-style.
Bang!
Would you trim that fingernail, Ming the Merciless?
Then the killer torched the building to make the body unidentifiable.
Or to remove any trace of his own fingerprints or DNA.
We couldn't even pull a print off the bullet.
Smart move.
In case you missed it, Detective.
This is my I-told-you-so face.
Which is kind of hard to distinguish from your "I thought this was going to be a new episode of Law and Order "but it turns out it's a repeat" face.
A dead body changes things.
That's his email signature.
So we're on board.
And because it's a homicide, it's our investigation.
No, it's arson.
And I've already briefed Army on all of this.
He says it's my case, I'm on point, you report to me.
Look, when we find our murderer, you'll find your arsonist.
No.
When I find my arsonist, I'll find your murderer.
No.
Guys, please.
Can't we come up with a term that covers both killer and arsonist?
How about "arsasin"?
The skeleton had trace amounts of methylbenzene, the primary component of TNT.
You can get it at any hardware store and it has a sweet odor.
All right, fine, but no one outside this room can know we recovered a skeleton.
And make sure the city treats the site like an accident.
All right, I want our killer Arsasin!
Or karsinist.
Arsasin.
I want the killer to feel safe.
I want him to think that his plan worked.
Secondly, the key to solving this case is to figure out who this guy was.
Come here often?
Wow.
You know, you could afford to slow down a little.
If you walk any faster you're gonna travel through time.
So what's our next move?
Well, I assume we're going to team up, right?
Travel cross-country solving mysteries, maybe set up shop on the side of the road, form a bluegrass trio.
Look, I appreciate you guys getting the cops to take this seriously but you don't have a lot of experience with this, so I prefer to handle point alone.
You know, Sun Tzu says that teamwork can be very sensual if you I'll email you the rest.
I'd go after her if she wasn't walking at cougar speeds.
Right.
So what are we doing?
Are we really done?
Gus, don't be William Zabka from Back to School.
We need to get in with the firemen who put out the fire.
Shotgun on fire pole.
You can't call shotgun on a fire pole.
And why them?
I think we're looking for a fireman, someone who knows fires, someone who knows the system.
He started the fires somewhere else then moved the flames towards the victim because the first thing an arson inspector looks for is a point of origin.
Okay, how in the world do you know all that?
I rode the Backdraft ride at Universal Studios like 74 times.
Shawn, you can't base a whole theory on a movie.
There's a movie?
Now, when we get in here, don't do that thing you used to do when we were kids.
Hi, fireman!
Help you?
Shawn Spencer, hunting an arsonist.
Step Anthony Wally Ali, cat stuck in a tree.
Oh, Conrad told me about you.
The psycho.
Psychic.
But before we get down to business is Fireman Paul around?
We heard he used to work out of here back in the day.
We just want to say hello.
He came to our school when we were kids.
No, we're sure he'd remember us.
Gus accidentally peed on him and I gave him impetigo.
Over here.
Died fighting the Renkel fires of '98, set by a bunch of vandals.
So you think it's arson, too?
You've been canoodling with Conrad?
Is Conrad a canoodler?
Did she say anything about me?
Can I get her a note through you?
I'm not sure I like random people interrogating my men, especially based on psychic hokum.
Hokum?
Well, that hokum found traces of methylbenzene at the scene.
Really?
Yeah, so my colleague would like to try and glean more hokum from your men.
Listen, it's been a long day.
My shift is over.
Manetti?
Manetti's my right hand man.
These guys are here about the fire.
Deal with it, would you?
So, you were the guys who put out the fire a week ago?
Yeah, it was us.
Thanks to Manetti, here.
Well, that's a given, you don't look old enough to operate a hose.
We doused that fire in 33 minutes.
Really?
You know, Dominos can still get you a pizza in under 30.
That might be more impressive.
Yeah?
Well, you should have seen how fast I booked the perps, back in my cop days.
Wow.
Well, we're police-affiliated, too.
So can we ask you a few questions?
We don't have time.
Starting training drills.
Perfect.
We're supposed to do them with you.
Really?
Who told you that?
Yeah, it sounded weird to us, too, but it's imperative that we get this information as soon as possible.
It's a headquarters thing.
Look, between you and me, there's nothing we'd rather do less, so why don't you just grab us a couple of these costumes and we'll get it over with.
You mean uniforms.
I've heard it both ways.
Can I ring the bell?
Go, go, go, go, go!
Get those stairs.
Come on, come on!
Get moving downhill!
This way, you're going downhill!
Move it, move it!
So, how many people did you pull out of the fire?
None, building was empty.
Keep moving.
Move it, move it, move it, go, go, go!
Did you notice anything weird about the fire besides the smell?
Lot of open spaces.
No furniture cluttering up the joint.
Hey!
There's been a freaking bomb!
Go, go, go, go!
No, I didn't see anyone suspicious in the crowd.
I questioned him already, Shawn.
Dude, he was doing the pole.
Did anyone miss their shift that night?
No.
No one wants to lose out on the OT.
Anybody here with a criminal record?
Shh.
No talking.
It kills the illusion.
How much more of this do I have to take?
Man, in order for him to stay certified in CPR he has to practice on a live person.
He's going to use a tongue guard when he gives you mouth-to-mouth.
So it's not even really like kissing.
What?
If you find yourself becoming aroused, don't beat yourself up.
You must be out of your damn mind.
Everybody move it!
This isn't part of the drill!
Let's go!
No, Shawn.
The arsonist might still be there.
And we're already geared up.
They won't even know I'm driving the truck.
We should stay here, get some gelato and read the fire department's report from the comfort of our not-on-fire office.
Dude, if we go, you can drive behind a speeding fire truck.
All right, repeat after me, we are not going into a burning building.
We are not not going into a burning building.
Bet!
Hey, I thought your shift was over.
I heard about it on my scanner.
What is this, Halloween?
Why, you got candy?
We'll take some Good & Plenty or Good & Fruity.
How bad is it in there?
I haven't been inside.
I'm patrolling the scene from out here.
So just try to stay out of the way, all right?
This is command.
First floor is secure.
I'm sending more men to the second floor.
Alpha, side.
Over.
No, Shawn.
We're not going into a burning building.
You promised.
Actually I didn't.
Yes, you did.
The first floor is secure.
Those things flare back up all the time.
And you know how fire's attracted to me.
Can you blame it?
Man, look at you.
Blair Underwood can't touch you right now.
Blair Underwood never played a fireman, either.
Exactly.
Come on.
I need the super sniffer.
Shawn.
This is not a good idea, Shawn!
Shawn!
Damn it!
I don't know.
Maybe we should try, uh Gus, where are you?
Down here.
The key is to stay underneath the smoke.
Would you get up?
Start sniffing.
There's something sweet in the air.
I need to see what the ceiling looked like before it was scorched.
Anything else?
Nope.
We're good.
In all the years of fighting fires, that was the dumbest thing I have ever seen.
If I were still a cop, I'd put you both in jail!
I definitely smelled something.
This fire was not an accident.
I'll do you one better.
The Chief had flakes of the unburned ceiling in his hair.
He was in there before the fire started.
We have found our "arson-urderer.
" What?
Fire arsman.
Uh-uh.
Your psychic hunch was right, Shawn.
This body was found in a wall space at the site of the fire.
Yes.
I could sense that the fires were related and since the first one was set to cover up a murder There might be a body at the second fire, too.
I'm sorry?
It was either "nice work" or "ice fork," but I couldn't tell which.
According to the ME's report, there's a unique purple rubber melted in between the victim's toes.
Unique how?
It has real specks of gold in it.
They think it came from the victim's sneakers.
Purple with gold specks.
That's Jet Jaguars.
Gus owned them.
They're the ugliest and most uncomfortable sneakers known to man.
I had a pair.
They weren't that bad.
They were proven to cause polio.
I have elongated metatarsals and inverted phalanges, Spencer.
I have to wear whatever fits.
Well, then you know they were only sold in '98 and then discontinued immediately.
The victim was wearing ten year old sneakers?
Who holds onto tennis shoes for that long?
Especially painful purple and gold ones.
If this man was wearing them at the time of his death, then he was definitely killed in '98, possibly by the fashion mafia.
Ten years ago?
That makes no sense.
Why would someone hang onto a body for a decade and then burn it to a crisp?
Unless, the body's been there the whole time.
Just rotting for ten years?
That's your theory.
Actually come to think of it, both buildings were built in '98.
An empty construction site is a good place to kill someone and it'd be easy to slip a body behind the dry wall.
What?
You sure you're not a germaphobe?
All right, let's just confirm the sneaker thing.
And if Spencer's right, let's get a list of all the buildings that were built ten years ago.
What?
You can just get a list of that kind of stuff?
I'd like a list of all available Zoltar machines.
For a little 14-year-old friend of mine.
Thanks, Jules.
So, Ms. Conrad, anything else I should know about the second fire?
Just that the fire fighters caught a break because there wasn't sufficient ventilation in the top floor.
Without the oxygen, the men had no trouble putting out the fire.
Yeah, that was us.
Thanks to Manetti, here.
We doused that fire in 33 minutes.
So both fires went out relatively easily.
I guess.
Yeah.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
I will bet every penny I have that I'm not.
The arsonist made the fires easy to put out.
Have you at all considered that this is an inside job?
Well, this building wasn't insured either.
The owners don't get anything.
Inside your department.
A fire fighter?
What are you doing?
Do you see a bruise on my chest from all that CPR?
All I see is chocolate with hair on it.
You know the rules, Shawn.
No sliding down a pole while I'm not here.
But you are here.
You're right here.
You know what I mean.
Especially when I'm stuck tailing Fire Chief Dan all day.
And they don't even have a Dalmatian here, Shawn.
Could you stop with the Dalmatians already?
I'm just saying.
It would be nice to see one in its natural habitat.
They're not indigenous to fire houses, Gus.
Did you find anything out or not?
Well, I hid in a corner while he got a picture framed of him and John Denver, and the Muppets.
Muppets?
Gonzo was a shock, boy.
What?
Sounds productive.
Then I just had to stand around while he spent an hour figuring out what type of roto-tiller to buy.
Well, it's not an easy decision, Gus.
After all, it's harvest season, Pa.
And Jeb can't work the plow.
You know he ain't been right since he come down with the consumption.
Will you stop, Shawn?
It did get interesting.
He's our guy and I know it.
He was on his cell phone constantly.
And I think I heard him ask about the accelerant.
After that, he came rushing back here in a panic.
Dude, it's sabotage.
He's making it harder for the men to put out the fires.
We got to stop him.
He's heading to the all purpose room.
There's only one exit to that room.
Here's the plan.
We corner, we confront, he confesses, we get samosas.
Bet!
Dude, is that really necessary?
I don't play with killers, Shawn.
Hello, children.
Yes!
Field trip to ye old fire station.
What are you two doing?
We are here to help with the lesson.
Clearly.
So, uh, kiddies, always remember to put out your cigarettes when you're finished smoking them.
Excuse me?
Uh, I mean, uh, don't smoke, uh, in bed.
Or in restaurants.
Or in caves?
No smoking.
Absolutely no smoking.
And don't listen to anyone who says that a pipe is cool because I'm telling it is not.
Get out.
Get out.
Get out.
Well, that was a waste of time.
Or was it?
What is that?
I accidentally mixed up Fire Chief Dan's phone with mine.
They're similar shapes and my hand was in his jacket pocket.
You stole his phone?
He was throwing us out.
Gus, I plead the third.
The third amendment is no soldier can live in your house against your will.
You mean the fifth.
Yeah, I've heard it both ways.
What other ways have you heard it?
Just look at this.
Five calls in a row to hardware stores all over the city.
Where one might go to buy methylbenzene.
That's what I'm talking about.
Fire Chief Dan?
Honestly?
That's why you brought me down to this death trap?
Death trap?
This office is in violation of almost every fire safety code on the books.
Not to contradict, but we are 100% up to code.
I don't walk into a building unless it's safe, much less work in one.
Your smoke detector is a paper bowl with an M&M stuck to it.
Shawn, where's the Ryerson smoke detector I bought for the office?
Oh, that thing?
It kept beeping during séance week.
Where is it now?
Charleston Chew?
Charleston Chew?
You also have an overloaded socket and a hot plate on the ground.
I like soup.
I won't apologize for that.
It's next to a stack of old newspapers.
I also like to read while I eat.
Can you please just tell me why you think it's Dan?
Well, it's not like I stole his cell phone or anything, 'cause, I mean, I don't do that sort of thing.
Although I am sensing someone did.
I'll solve that later.
No this is just deeply rooted psychic vibage.
I know it's hard to believe.
No, actually it's not.
It kind of makes sense.
He never thought it was arson and he hated it when I questioned his men.
What did the cops say?
We haven't told them.
We thought you'd like to make the bust.
After all, this is your case.
Oh, well, that I mean, to say that I mean, that you would think of me, that you would do that This seems like a great opportunity for a hug.
Come here.
Uh.
No?
Ah, rotator cuff.
Right.
There's been another fire.
With another body?
Forensics is on the way.
Another body.
You were right.
As a courtesy, I want to let you know my office is going to be bringing in Dan Trombly for questioning.
The Fire Chief?
Correct.
That could be a problem.
Why?
Because that skeleton wasn't the only body we found.
Lift that please.
Oh.
It says here that the Fire Chief died of asphyxiation.
Smoke inhalation.
Oh, I'm getting something.
How much more of this do I have to endure?
Do you see the bruise on my chest from all that CPR?
There was someone else there.
They tried to give him CPR before he died.
Maybe someone who knew him.
Of course they knew him.
It's like practically kissing.
What the hell was the Fire Chief doing there in the first place?
I mean, I don't think he started the fire.
He wasn't wearing any protective gear, there weren't any traces of accelerants on him.
We got a break.
The latest skeleton is still too burned to get an ID, but our killer didn't know that our victim had ICD in his body.
Ew, they make those for men?
It's like a pace maker.
Tracked the serial number back to Central Coast Components who sold it to Saint Mary's who implanted it into our victim 12 years ago.
O'Hara, what do we know about our victim?
Wait, our skeleton was a criminal?
That's right.
His name is Steven J. Renkel.
As in the kid from Family Matters.
No.
As in the Renkel fires of '98.
Yes.
Guys, bring it in.
So our victim was a fire-starter himself?
Yeah, they were a bunch of vandals who liked going around and starting fires.
These are Renkel's only known accomplices.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Oh, I'm getting something.
The second victim is in one of those pictures.
What?
How do you know that?
He's telling me he was murdered.
He saying it poorly, because he speaks with a whistle.
A whistle, like he speaks like this.
Which would be endearing on an 8-year-old, maybe Terry-Thomas or the original supermodel, Lauren Hutton.
But this This just screams for adult braces.
Any form of simple orthodontia really.
It's not that expensive.
You're saying it's the guy who has the gap in his teeth?
Don't say gap.
He prefers tooth alley, but yes, it is.
I remember these guys.
They all disappeared around the same time.
We figured they just skipped town.
That's it.
The third victim is up there as well.
He's not speaking because he's afraid you'll criticize his appearance, just like you did with tooth-gap boy.
Look, now you got me doing it.
Someone must have hunted them down and killed them ten years ago.
And now they're burning off the evidence.
That's a long time to wait to clean up a mess.
You should see how long it takes Gus to clean his cereal bowl.
Only one guy in the crew has been a suspect in other arsons since the Renkel fire.
And that's Bodie Lambert.
All right.
So why is Bodie the only one we're still hearing from?
Maybe he turned on his partners.
It happens all the time.
This could be our killer.
Furderer.
What?
Fire murderer.
Furderer.
Put a BOLO on him ASAP.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You're going to issue these guys bolo ties?
It stands for "be on the lookout.
" Oh.
What are you doing?
Army will kill you if he sees you messing with this stuff.
Now why are we here?
The cops are following the bodies.
I thought we'd take a different avenue.
Buildings.
What do we know?
They're all commercial and industrial, and they were all built in the same year.
After the Renkel fire.
Correct.
Lot of open spaces.
No furniture cluttering up the joint!
Also they seem to be abandoned, yet none of them are for sale.
Why would three different owners leave valuable real estate like that sitting around empty?
What can I do for you guys?
We need to see your files on the three burned buildings.
Sure.
Just fill out requisition form ID 88.
You can get them upstairs.
That will take forever.
We really need Paperwork is paperwork.
It's the basis for civilization.
Just fill out the forms.
I'll give you everything you need.
Fire alarm?
We better evacuate.
All right, everybody out of here.
I got to go deal with this.
Good thing we had a plan B ready.
You smell like a peach meadow.
That's the incense I used to set off the smoke detector.
You didn't just pull the fire alarm?
It's right there on the wall.
Uh, that's a crime, Shawn.
I remain not culpable.
I didn't set off the detector.
The smoke did.
Who burned the incense?
I plead the fifth.
Mmm-hmm.
Element?
Dimension?
Beatle?
You can't plead Billy Preston.
All right, what are we doing?
Bring up the burned buildings.
Okay.
Here we are.
Dude, all these buildings have SR next to them.
That stands for seismic retrofit.
It applies to any building built in '98.
It looks like all the safety codes were just changed last week.
Right before the first fire.
That's why they're all empty.
They're no longer considered earthquake safe.
They're going to open up the walls to bring them up to code.
Dude, that's it.
That's what started this whole thing.
The killer realized that the bodies he stashed in those buildings ten years ago are going to be discovered and now he's torching the evidence.
There's like 20 buildings scheduled to be retrofitted.
Let me print out the list.
Yeah, snap it up.
We still have a few minutes before they let anybody back in the building.
Dude, trust me, you want to hurry.
You could have pulled me out of there.
Dude, I gave you two full warnings.
My underwear's soaked.
Just like old times.
Kiss my Guys!
One of those buildings is going to be targeted next by the arsonist.
Are you sure?
I'm Al B. Sure!
Watching Diane Schuur apply Sure Roll-On while viewing The Sure Thing.
That's pretty sure.
That's all-day sure.
You are a strange person but extremely effective.
See?
Teamwork isn't the worst thing.
Psychically I could sense that there was information in that office that we needed so, uh, I'll go check with the cops while you scope those out.
Boom!
Carpel tunnel.
Hey.
That's fair.
Hey, we got a hit on that BOLO.
A sheriff in Barstow found Bodie Lambert holed up in a Motel 6 under one of his aliases.
Excellent!
Dobson!
Yes, sir.
Get a hold of Barstow PD.
Tell them not to make a move without us.
Will do.
He is mine.
Police!
Clear!
Okay, you got anything?
Nothing here.
All clear.
Do these things come in different sizes?
Because my movement is very constricted.
I feel like it's creating all the wrong lines.
Maybe if there were V- necks or lapels.
Or epaulets.
What are they doing here?
I may have given them a heads-up.
It wasn't exactly an invitation.
He must have bolted out the window.
He's not going to get far.
Aerial 2, you got a 20 on our perp?
You called in air support for this?
Of course I did.
Excuse me!
If I may.
What are you doing?
Uh, you might want to stand back.
Freeze.
Put your hands behind your back.
He's not talking.
I sense that he's superstitious.
He might talk to someone from a higher ethereal plane.
May I have a shot?
Knock yourself out.
Give me a second.
I have to go outside and get something off the ground.
Hey.
Shawn Spencer, psychic interrogator.
Maybe you remember me from when I apprehended you.
Remember back then?
No?
That's okay.
I got everything I need.
Have fun in prison.
Word to the wise.
Don't drop the bar of soap.
Oh, please.
Don't try that routine on me.
No, literally, man, don't drop the soap.
There's so much bacteria on those floors.
I'm pretty sure they only issue one bar a month, so.
Why are you eating that?
Raw leaves is what the Earth Mother allows me to eat.
It banishes all negative entities.
What, are you a fairy?
Hardly.
I've seen Little Darlings like 11 times.
But I am a male Wiccan.
You're not Wiccan.
I'm level eight, Jack.
I'd be level nine if it wasn't for my seasonal pollen allergies.
What's your coven?
Say what?
What's your pass phrase.
I don't know you, man.
Same time, one, two, three.
Knight Rider.
Gardnerian.
Wait, what?
Gardener rerarian.
Exactly what you said, man.
Oh, it is so dope to connect with other weirdos.
But right here, man, you and me, we understand each other.
All that fairy stuff aside, I dig you, Bodie.
I dig you, Bodie.
Now, I only got a minute before the cops come in here and haul you out.
So I'm going to level with you.
The Earth Force Mother is pretty POed at you, man.
Me?
You're crazy.
I didn't do anything.
She sent me here to stop you.
How do you think I found you in that ceiling, bro?
Luck?
No.
I got a message.
Why is the Earth Spirit after me?
She knows you lit those fires, bro.
We found the crew mates you murdered in the buildings.
I didn't kill nobody, brother.
It must have been that guy.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait, what guy?
Ten years ago, somebody started hunting us down.
Someone grabbed me out of my car, took me to some construction site, made me get on my knees, told me I had to pay for killing those two firemen.
Then he pulls the trigger.
Nothing happens.
I got the hell out of there.
I haven't been to Santa Barbara since that night.
I found Wicca and reformed.
Where did this mystery man take you, bro?
Like an address or something?
I had a bag over my head most of the time.
But that night is burned in my mind.
I was about to die.
And all I remember hearing is birds.
Lots of them.
Sounded like hundreds.
Birds?
Yeah.
Chirping.
Wicca out brother.
Shawn, I still can't believe the police thought your bird chirping clue was too vague.
Well, they're still trying to figure out what building Bodie was taken to.
Hey.
Well, at least Bodie told us the killer's motive.
Someone is avenging the deaths of the firemen killed in the Renkel fires.
Maybe it is a firefighter.
I warned you, Shawn, firefighters are trouble.
I did everything in my power to keep you off the pole.
And you succeeded, Dad, in every conceivable way.
But since our bad guy was targeting criminals, rogue cop is now added to the list.
We have all the potential arson targets.
Since our killer scouted one out for Bodie, he may have still used them for other victims.
And all you got going is your bird chirping?
Wait a minute.
What about Miss Mugglesworth?
My cockatoo when I was eight?
Yeah.
Wow.
I haven't thought about her in years.
Remember when she died, your parents fed you some story about taking her somewhere?
The bird sanctuary.
But she's not dead.
She's still there.
Living amongst other relinquished avians.
Gus, have you seen her since your parents took her there?
Of course not.
She had a rare bird disease, where she would lose her feathers if anyone ever looked at her.
So she has to be kept in a special mirrored cage.
What?
Gus, your parents lied to you.
We do it sometimes to protect our kids.
Your bird bit the big one.
Sorry, pal.
Yeah.
Not all pets can go live on a special wheat farm like my rabbits.
That's right, son.
Where is this bird sanctuary?
Third Street and D. Third and D?
Yeah.
Really?
Dude, hundreds of birds chirping.
That never occurred to you until now?
Leaving Mrs. Mugglesworth was a painful memory, Shawn.
I blocked it out until Guys, guys, guys, the Daedalus Building.
It's right there.
Right in that area.
When is it schedded to be retrofitted?
Tomorrow.
Well, that means your pyromaniac is going to get to work today.
Shawn, we told Morgan to check all these buildings.
I gotta call her and tell her not to go in without backup!
Damn it.
I still can't get a hold of Morgan.
I got a bad feeling about this.
Did you call Lassiter and the fire department?
They're on their way.
Morgan!
Army Johnson?
Stay where you are.
Don't make a move.
Dude, start talking.
Stall him until everybody gets here.
Don't let him toss that flame.
I know you killed those criminals.
But I know why.
Honey, the last time this city had an arsonist was so long ago I was still on the big red truck.
Because, back in the day you were a fireman.
And those vandals set fires that took the lives of two of your colleagues.
Died fighting the Renkel fires of '98, set by a bunch of vandals.
I served side by side with those firemen for years.
They had families.
You're right.
They did.
So you left the department and took a job inspecting buildings for code violations and you discovered those are pretty good places to hide a body.
So you stalked and killed your victims, you covered them with lye and you plugged them into walls.
But your old buddy, the Fire Chief, figured you out.
He made a few calls.
Five calls in a row to hardware stores all over the city.
Confirmed that it was you that bought the accelerant.
And finally he caught you in the act.
Army, what are you doing?
Don't do it!
Don't do it!
It was too late, wasn't it?
Always the fireman, he tried to put it out.
You even tried to save his life.
Come on, Danny!
It was my fault.
Danny wasn't supposed to be there.
What about us?
Huh?
What about your arson inspector?
We didn't do anything.
Do we deserve to die?
I don't I don't No.
No.
But But I can't live with this anymore.
No!
Gus!
Get Morgan!
Get Morgan!
This is a mess.
Where's Shawn?
His car's over there.
I can see somebody coming out.
Are you guys okay?
What the hell happened?
What is Army Johnson doing here?
He's He's He's the bad guy.
Really?
Well, look at that.
Got you doing the grunt work, huh?
Well, all the new volunteers have to do it.
How's it going so far?
I'm pretty much a hero to the newbies.
I mean I've already been in two fires, carried a man out, stopped an arsonist.
Yes, you have.
Well, I just wanted to drop something by before I visit Morgan in the hospital.
What's that?
Meet your new fire dog.
Lady Godiva.
That's a boy, Shawn.
Oh, yeah.
Look at that.
I've already cleared it with the new Fire Chief.
You just got to walk him, feed him, clean up after him and what not.
He needs eye drops at two, ear drops at three, and he may or may not have mange.
You're not leaving that thing here.
I'm not taking care of him.
Gus, if you don't take him, Cruella will turn him into ear muffs.
Goodbye, Lady G. Shawn, Shawn!
Did you paint these spots on?
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 12}{START OF EPISODE 13}
So that's it from the Thunderdome as quarterback Sammy Winslow and the T-Birds lose another heartbreaker.
Winslow was brilliant at times today, throwing for three touchdowns, but his two second-half interceptions were absolute backbreakers.
This is the greatest moment of my whole life.
Yeah, you see, being a cop has its advantages, huh?
This is pretty cool.
There he comes.
Oh, my God.
I've got to get his autograph.
He's so cool.
Just relax, relax.
Remember, he's a person, just like me.
Oh, no, he's way better than you.
Hey.
Good game.
Uh, great game, Sammy.
But do you want to know why you threw that interception in the third quarter?
Shh.
Why?
Well, every time you're going to throw a quick pass to the left side, you rub your hands together then pat the ball twice.
Which is probably why you threw those six picks in the last three games.
Or something.
I don't know.
Sorry.
He's a perceptive little pain in the butt, or something.
Sorry.
You can't do that.
He's a quarterback.
Kid.
Oh, my God!
My God!
Whoa!
Whoa!
We got the game ball.
I got the game ball.
Where have you two been?
We've left you 12 messages.
Sorry.
We were having our biannual Rae Dawn Chong movie marathon.
Did you see Quest for Fire?
Guys, the Chief is not happy.
You have to keep your cell phones on at all times.
This would all be a lot easier if you'd just run with my genius psych signal idea.
No.
Don't you mean yes?
What are you talking about?
It's like the bat signal, only way awesomer.
The silhouette in the sky would be my hand to my head, psychic style.
I drew up a whole proposal.
That would have cost the department $200,000.
We covered that with our bake sale alone.
And what's going on with our badges?
You're not getting badges.
She has one.
She's a cop.
All right, fine, we'll settle for guns.
It's about time.
Come with me.
We may have a missing persons case we need you to look into.
"May have"?
That doesn't sound very definitive.
Do you have any leads?
There's one.
Mr. Spencer, we need you to psychically tell us who belonged to this foot.
Does he know that's where they keep the bodies for identification?
I think he's figuring that out right now.
There you go.
So what can you tell us?
It's weird.
The lower extremities give off very, very intense psychic vibes.
For instance the pinky toe is telling me that he went to the market.
No, I'm sorry that's wrong.
He, uh He actually stayed home.
And something about wee-wee and roast beef.
Okay, I knew this was a waste of time.
The foot was found by hikers this morning on a trail near Lake Cachuma.
Mr. Spencer, we have to assume that we were meant to find this foot, which means that we're dealing with a psycho.
I'm going to position this case as a possible murder investigation.
I can only keep this foot thing quiet for a day or two.
Don't want to panic the community.
You're saying you think this thing might cause quite a stink.
All right, now I just feel like a heel.
That was callous.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Oh, hey, yeah.
Had to bolt out of there.
My cell phone was, like, literally shocking my leg.
It must be the battery or something.
I like that story.
Let's stick with it.
You know, there was something weird about the way the big toe was smushed and the side of the foot was callused.
Not random.
Almost symmetrical, you know, like it happened over time.
It probably comes from some repeated action like kicking.
Or kicking.
He could have been an athlete.
Like a soccer player.
Or a soccer player.
Sorry.
It helps me think.
Google "missing foot.
" That was your plan?
Not all of it.
Watch out!
Watch out!
Rogue foot on the loose.
I can't control it.
It's heel-toed down from the spirit world to give me a swift kick in the ass.
And now Now it's channeling a message through my own foot.
What's it saying?
Besides "everyone cut loose"?
Let's listen.
Something about the big toe, the way it was smushed, callused, as if it belonged to someone who kicked things a lot.
A prison guard?
A Rockette?
A kangaroo?
An athlete.
Yes, an athlete, perhaps a soccer player.
Soccer players wear shoes.
The toe thing wouldn't happen unless the person was barefoot.
Again, let me pitch kangaroo.
What else do you have, Spencer?
I mean, do you have a name?
Are they in danger?
Are they still alive?
Darn it.
Vision gone.
I'll have to sit with this one.
Just get back to us when you have something.
And it better be quick.
Chief, my middle name is Quick!
I changed it from Boutros-Ghali.
Are you sure it's Vlad Alexavic?
Think about it.
He's the only player in the league that kicks without his shoe.
Plus, you said he had surgery on his ankle last year.
Yeah, he jumped off of Kathy Griffin's balcony on a dare, blew out his ankle, missed the entire playoffs.
The scar on the ankle was fresh.
I don't know, Shawn.
Even for you that's a big leap.
And what are we going to do?
Just walk into a pro-football training camp and start asking if anyone's missing a foot?
The words foolproof and plan do come to mind, yes.
What are you guys doing here?
I was drawn here by a name that's been kicking around my psychic third brain.
Vlad Vlad Alexavic?
The T-Bird kicker?
Yeah, after you left, I started thinking about the connection between the big toe and an athlete, and then I realized Vlad is the only kicker who kicks without a shoe.
Jules.
Color me impressed.
And purple with a streak of magenta.
Well, I dated a Miami Dolphin, for a while, one summer.
Uh-huh, yeah, so you're really attracted to big meat-headed football players.
Oh, they're not all meatheads.
And I don't know, it's just something about that uniform.
Mmm.
Yeah, so anyway Shawn and I thought that if we could get some information about Vlad from the team It's already done.
We matched DNA samples to the foot yesterday.
It's Vlad.
Set, hut!
Out round.
Dude, can you believe this?
We're standing on the field of an actual pro football training camp.
This is awesome.
My dad would love this.
Yeah.
Too bad he's not talking to you.
You should have just gone on the camping trip.
Oh, I'll make it up to him this week.
I'll head over there for dinner, bring him a pouch of Big League Chew, maybe watch a couple episodes of The Mentalist, be fine.
Dude, this is going to be the coolest case of all time.
I should have brought my autograph book.
I've been stuck on C. Everett Koop and Drew Lachey for a while.
I don't see what the big deal is.
Bunch of guys in tights and hard hats playing in the dirt.
What?
I'm not a big fan of football.
What are you a fan of exactly?
I don't know.
The gun sports.
What are we waiting for?
To talk to Sam Winslow.
He's the coach and general manager.
Are you kidding me?
We get to meet Slinging Sammy Winslow?
What?
So.
So?
He's one of the greatest quarterbacks in the history of pro football.
He also happens to be a very good friend of mine.
You met him once when you were ten.
And the only thing that my dad and I both like besides Asian slaw and Harry Hamlin.
Who's with me?
Who's with me on Hamlin?
Literally, no one's with you.
Sammy won a championship his first season as a coach, but he hasn't even been to the playoffs in six years.
Sounds like he's not a very good coach.
Come on!
You call that a two minute drill?
I could get to Dallas on my nephew's Big Wheel faster than you ladies.
It's ridiculous.
Reset!
It's ridiculous.
See, you're too tall to be an agent.
You must be a shoe rep.
No.
I'm a cop.
We need to speak to you about one of your players.
I'm Detective Lassiter.
This is my partner, Detective O'Hara.
These are Never mind.
I don't want the press to see this.
I'll give you two minutes, all right?
Come with me.
Thank you.
Come on.
Come on.
You found Vlad's foot?
You sure it's his?
I'm afraid so.
When's the last time you saw him?
It's been a few weeks.
I mean, he was a hold out.
I mean, Vlad's always been a bit of a free spirit.
He's disappeared during the off season before.
I just thought he was doing it again.
We're going to need to speak with some of your players.
We'd appreciate it if you kept the information about Mr. Alexavic quiet for the time being.
Could someone have killed him?
That's what we're here to find out.
I can't believe I'm saying this, do you two think you could have spoken up a little bit?
Oh!
Sorry about that.
That's what happens to us when we're in the presence of one of our heroes.
Gus almost fainted when we ran into Ralph Macchio at a Del Taco.
For the record, he was not working there.
Why don't we interview the players and you guys take care of everything else?
Sure.
Heard you guys were asking questions about Vlad.
What's going on?
It's unclear at this point, Mr. Tompkins.
It's Matt.
Look, Vlad's one of my bros.
If there's a problem, I want to know about it.
If you have any information about Vlad, we could really use the help.
Well, I don't want to start any rumors or anything, but I did hear that he owed a lot of money to people.
What people?
Bookies, I think.
I also heard a rumor that he tried to start a nightclub with some of his cousins and lost a sh A load of money.
Would that be Russian cousins?
What do you think?
Hut!
Great.
While you guys were goofing off we actually got a lead.
Matt Tompkins told us that Vlad lost a bunch of money that belonged to some Russian cousins.
What did you guys find?
Just this.
What's that?
Vlad's phone.
We found it in his locker.
You stole it?
Benji, the locker room attendant let us in.
Big fan of Rent.
Told him Gus was Taye Diggs so he also gave us these old jerseys.
How do I look, Jules?
Like my 11-year-old nephew in his Peyton Manning pajamas.
Your 11-year-old nephew is ruggedly sexy?
That's weird.
Whoa!
Hang on.
Look at that.
That is a direct threat.
This plus the foot screams Russian mob.
Really?
I don't hear anything.
I'm just saying we found that phone awfully easy, and there just happens to be a threatening text on it.
Come on.
So you think someone planted it in his locker?
No, I think someone put it there on purpose.
That's what I just said.
But mine wasn't in the form of a question so it comes from a place of power.
I'm not going to stand here and listen to this.
And we'll be back with a search warrant for the contents of that locker.
You see we actually follow police procedure.
Oh.
So what do we do now?
Benji said the only ones allowed in the locker room are players and team personnel.
The answer to what happened to Vlad is not in some Russian bathhouse.
No, we need to get close to the team.
Are you saying we go undercover?
I'm saying we assume alternate identities, so that we can get in there and investigate without drawing any extra attention to ourselves.
Coach Winslow?
Sorry to bother you.
It's all right.
Come in.
You were with the cops earlier.
Yeah.
You didn't say a word.
No, because I was observing.
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm a psychic who works for the SBPD.
This is my partner, Dekwan "Smallpox" Randolph.
You can call him Gus.
We work on high-profile cases like this all the time.
Yeah, well, this is my fault.
I mean, I knew that Vlad was going off the rails and I didn't do anything.
No, no, no, Coach, please.
Don't beat yourself up.
You probably get this a lot, but we're huge fans of yours.
I slept on your face for years.
I mean I had sheets with you on them when I was a kid.
And we've actually met before.
I was the kid after the Denver game who told you about your interceptions.
Oh, yeah.
I told you he'd remember me.
Yeah.
You know I didn't throw a pick the rest of the year.
Oh, boy, I thought I'd play football forever, you know.
Sure as heck never thought I'd end up a coach.
Well, Coach, I'm here because I'm sensing some very dark forces coming from your team.
Whoever did this to Vlad might want to harm other players as well.
I think that we can help.
And how can you possibly help?
Red 17!
Red 17!
Check down!
Check down!
Red 17!
Dragon!
Shawn.
Wildebeest!
Shawn!
Bevell came back too early from his concussion.
He's afraid of getting hit.
Fletcher.
All he's worrying about is divorce.
He's not focused on the game.
Dayne may seem heavy but it's just water weight.
He's actually going to be fine.
Bollinger is freaking out 'cause he thinks his wife might know that he's sleeping with the reporter from Channel 5.
And Calderwood, well, he's just not cool with being demoted to second team, even if he says he is.
Yes, no, knee, juice, possibly gay, definitely gay.
That is incredible.
I mean I already knew about Dorn, suspected Kenney, but I mean that Still, that's impressive.
So what is in this for you?
Oh, we just want to find whoever did this to Vlad, help you get your team back.
Oh.
And maybe lead the team out of the tunnel one time for a game.
That is not going to happen.
Well, you know, I may need your help but there's just one problem.
I mean, these guys are not going to just let somebody walk in off the street and get close to them.
They have to think that you belong.
All right, let's get this done fast.
We got ten other spots to check today.
They said the locker room guy has the key and he's on the field.
All right, I want to see all the kickers trying out on the field right now.
That's right.
It's real.
Feel free to drink it in.
Little help.
Okay.
It's all good.
So, Adam, Vlad just came in here last year and beat you out of the job, huh?
Yeah, well, he's not here, so it's my job to win now.
Ah, shake that a little.
I've never heard of you before.
You said you played in Tampa?
Tel Aviv.
Israeli Arena League.
Didn't play on the Sabbath so you probably didn't see me.
I've also been out of the game for a little while.
I've had a couple of knee surgeries and this elbow is filled with ostrich cartilage.
Six, get out there and kick.
Sure, Coach.
Did I see you give an interview to ESPN this morning?
First of all, it was ESPN Deportes and it was an exclusive, Coach.
You can't be giving interviews.
You're a non-roster invitee.
I told the docs you had an MCL tear, which means no kicking.
You're here to solve a murder.
No interviews, no kicking, solve the murder.
Got it.
All right, let's go, girls!
Pick it up!
My grandmother moves faster.
All right, Estevez Estevez, you're up.
Actually it's Emilio Estevez Estevez.
And I have a knee injury so I can't kick.
If you ain't going to kick then get off this field.
Are you saying I don't have a choice?
No.
Get out there.
What's up?
That was awesome!
It was just a 21-yarder.
Yeah?
Well, I was in an iron lung a week ago.
Huh?
Dude, check the books.
I think I just tied Tom Dempsey's record for longest field goal.
Yeah, no, you didn't.
His record is 63 yards, not 63 feet.
What's up in your world?
Look, Shawn, we can't be wasting time.
Lassiter's on this Russian thing, and we only have two days to figure out what happened to Vlad.
Two days to fulfill That's what a team manager wears, huh?
I'm not a team manager.
I'm a training intern.
And I've been setting up massage tables for the last hour.
You know what they do on those massage tables, Shawn?
They play Connect Four.
They massage men.
Big hairy men.
Mmm.
Look, let me be very clear, these hands are not touching anyone.
I only use these hands to touch myself.
Um, let me rephrase that.
Please stop speaking and no more fist bumps for the rest of the day.
Carlton, we have been to every place even remotely connected to Russia and all of Eastern Europe and we have found nothing.
We have to start looking someplace else.
Maybe there's something in this stuff from Vlad's locker.
Just a bunch of junk.
Huh.
What?
Well, Tompkins said he thought Vlad was gambling, right?
Yeah.
These could be bets that he made.
Look, it says Miami plus six, KC minus two.
Look at this, it's a phone number.
Do you still have Vlad's phone records?
Yeah, but they didn't show anything.
The text that Vlad got was from a disposable phone.
Check this, 80555514 That number called Vlad twice last week.
We've got a lead.
Let's go!
While you were fooling around I was investigating.
Ever since the cops came, everyone's talking about Vlad.
What are they saying?
None of the players liked that dude.
He either owes them money, tried to sleep with their wives, or called them out in the press.
Did I move it?
No.
Not one nanometer.
Nanometer, what is that?
Like two or three feet?
I don't think everyone hated Vlad.
Check it out.
He has one of those warriors towels in his locker, too.
They call themselves the warriors because they're the craziest guys on the team.
Matt Tompkins, Vince Garner and Drew Shacker are the leaders.
Man.
Now I'm gonna have to figure out a way to get close to those guys that doesn't involve getting a lobotomy or showering with strange men with volcano nipples.
Coach is crazy if he thinks I'm playing special teams this year.
If I get injured on a play there goes my bonus.
Exactly.
Right?
Whoa!
What are you doing?
Have you guys seen Altered States?
No.
I just got back from being a monkey.
Why did I think that would land?
You scared the hell out of us, bro.
Sorry, bro.
Emilio Estevez Estevez.
New kicker.
You mean like the actor guy?
You're thinking of Charlie Sheen.
What?
Actually you're probably not thinking of anything.
Nice ink.
Thanks, man.
Yeah, this is my wife, that's my mom, and that's this stripper I hook up with in Vegas sometimes.
Very sweet.
I dated a dancer once, Destiny.
Real name was Glitter.
Nothing there?
So, what's up with your kicker, Vlad?
Some pretty crazy rumors floating around.
I don't know what to tell you, man.
Vlad's kind of a loner.
Yeah, we didn't really know him.
I heard something about some Russians.
I hope it's not that they're coming.
They're coming.
The Russians.
Well, that's it for me.
I I got to go get my steroid shot.
Whoops, probably shouldn't have said that out loud.
Steer clear.
Might be some pee in that one.
This is definitely the address and there's a picture of Vlad on the shelf.
Oh, no.
Look at that.
Madame, why do you have that picture here?
Oh, I'm a huge fan of Chad.
One day I plan to have his baby.
We're detectives with the SBPD.
We're looking for any information you might have on Vlad Alexavic.
Oh, dear.
Go around back!
Get on your knees!
Hands on your head.
Nice work, O'Hara.
Sergei Vangieff.
Vangieff.
Yeah, whatever.
You, my friend, have a big problem.
Your visa runs out next month.
So?
So, you either give us something or it's bye-bye, Santa Barbara, hello, Saint Petersburg.
I can't go back to Russia, man.
My lady and I, we are starting aquarium store.
We already have a bathtub full of koi.
Why were you calling Vlad Alexavic last week?
Did I?
Okay, Vlad owes me money.
You were booking bets for him, right?
That's why you ran?
Da.
But it was just to make money to buy fountain of child spitting water for store.
His old girlfriend introduced us.
Vlad and I are friends.
Sergei, bookmaking's a very serious offense.
What is it now, like, five years in prison?
Oh, more if you take the bets over the phone.
That's interstate wire fraud.
Who's going to feed all those fish?
Are you going to start soon?
I already did.
What do you mean?
You don't feel it?
Feel what?
The heat.
See, I'm using what's called the hovering technique.
I learned it from some monks in Cambodia.
It's forbidden to touch the skin.
Yeah.
I think I feel it.
You do?
I mean, good.
Now, what I want you to do is close your eyes tight and focus on the power source coming from my hands.
Yeah.
Now I totally feel it.
Oh, yeah.
That's awesome.
Oh, can you do the buttocks?
The hover technique?
Resourceful Gus makes a rare appearance.
Please tell me you have something so we can get out of here.
It depends.
What can you tell me about poison oak?
What can't I tell you?
It's the three-leaf devil, causes severe itching and a red bumpy rash.
Found only on the Pacific coast and usually near bodies of fresh water.
Huh.
The foot was found by hikers this morning on a trail near Lake Cachuma.
Come on.
We gotta call the ME and check something out, but I think I might know where Vlad's body is.
How?
Calamine lotion.
Calamine lotion?
All right, thanks.
You were right.
The ME said the pink flakes under Vlad's toenails were dried calamine lotion.
And this is the closest lake to training camp.
Cops obviously got my message.
What are you doing?
It's game time.
I'm about to blow their minds.
How do I look?
Like an idiot.
Sweet.
Sorry I'm late.
Practice ran long.
By the way, Jules, you might want to jump on the Spencer bandwagon.
Sign up for my newsletter.
Maybe buy my fathead.
Spencer, what are you doing here?
Vlad's body, it's dark, it's murky, his voice is a little Warbley.
That's right.
Like it's calling to me from underwater.
Maybe a river, a stream, perhaps a Lake?
Yeah, we pulled up Vlad's body an hour ago.
Mr. Spencer, it looks like you're a little late to the game this time.
What?
No witty retort?
No reference to some obscure '80s film?
Wow.
O'Hara, write this down.
I don't have a pen.
Make note of the date and time that I, Carlton Lassiter, actually shut Shawn Spencer's cavernous pie hole.
Yeah.
Sorry, what was that?
Something about Night of the Comet.
Just forget it.
Okay, we need to expedite this.
Make it a top priority.
We received a tip that Vlad had been using an old girlfriend's cabin on the lake.
When we went back and ran some of his credit cards, we found out that one was used at the Cold Spring gas station.
On Highway 154?
Yep.
And the attendant there said that he remembered seeing Vlad three days ago and that he got into a car with several other men.
Which we assume is our Russian connection.
You see, boys, at the end of the day, good old-fashioned police work always wins out.
"Old-fashioned"?
So you went and billy-clubbed some immigrants.
You know, Jules, it's a shame you didn't see my kick at practice.
Yeah.
Sorry I missed it.
I didn't.
Oh, I almost forgot.
Just a little something to make this whole police thing official.
Isn't this the same thing you gave the former Laotian general who sells peanuts outside the station?
Yeah, but his actually says "detective" on it.
Chief, I need a favor.
Please don't release the info about finding Vlad's body yet.
Come on.
Give me one good reason.
I'll give you five.
I'll give you one.
I know deep down in my psychic loins that the Russian angle is completely wrong.
Why?
Because all signs point directly to it?
Exactly.
Whoever did this thinks they got away with it.
We release the info now, they're just going to run.
Give me one day.
It's going to take us at least 24 hours to find and notify them in Russia.
That gives you one day.
Thank you, Chief.
Come on, Gus.
Oh, Lassy, your haircut is worse than Joyce Hyser's in Just One of the Guys.
Thank you and good night.
Why isn't my dad picking up?
Probably because you were supposed to be at his house three hours ago for your apology dinner.
Well, we'll have a late dinner.
Late?
It's already Way past curfew.
We're going to get caught and you might end up losing your roster spot.
Why did we come back here?
Because the answer to what happened to Vlad is with the team.
The warriors lied about being friends with him and Drew referred to him in the past tense.
Yeah, we didn't really know him.
So the guys were with Vlad at the lake, but they lied about it.
Exactly.
Something went down.
I just don't know what or who else was there.
What do we do now?
Be careful.
There's a cover up here.
A lot of guys hated Vlad.
Anybody could be involved.
You guys know why you're here.
You have two choices.
Dude, I think we're on top of the stadium.
Do not step forward.
You can either jump or get pushed off.
You got five seconds to decide.
Five, four, three, two, one!
Hey, hey, hey, what do you think you're doing?
Enough already.
It's Matt and Vince.
We might be screwed.
Don't be an idiot.
You could blow this whole thing for all of us.
We were only trying to scare them.
Coach is not going to find out.
Hell yes he can.
And there goes our contracts.
You get these guys off this building and into their rooms now.
Right.
Guys, take the hoods off.
Show's over.
Sorry about that, guys!
Beer?
What were you going to do?
Haze us?
It's training camp.
You know, it gets so intense, you got to cut loose a little.
What was all that stuff with Matt and Vince about?
You don't have guaranteed contracts so you don't have to worry about that.
Just don't tell Coach what we did, all right?
Come on, guys!
Oh, gosh.
Dude, I got it.
We need to talk to Sammy.
He always works late.
What about your dad?
I'll figure that out on the way.
Shawn, you're not the person I want to see right now.
I know.
I know, and I'm sorry.
I'm gonna make it up to you.
I promise.
Uh Do you Do you still have that football?
The Thunderbirds football that I got when I was a kid?
I don't know.
Maybe up in the attic.
Why?
I want him to sign it.
Henry, that steak was downright vicious, baby.
I mean, thank you for having me over.
You know, I don't remember the last time I had a home-cooked meal.
You kidding?
Sammy Winslow at my house, I should be thanking you.
Or you could thank me, since I brought him over, but it's neither here nor there.
Do you know that Shawn and I used to sit in that living room right there and watch every single one of your games?
Do you remember that, Shawn?
Remember?
I remember I had to stand next to the fridge the entire second half of the playoff game against Seattle in '88 'cause every time I got an Otter Pop, you threw a touchdown.
He didn't want to jinx it.
Hey, we won, right?
Yes, we did.
I still can't believe that you let Shawn talk you into this crazy plan.
Well, you know the kid does have a way with words.
I mean, I'm not sure if he's a genius or if he's totally full of it.
Wow, maybe he's a little bit of both.
Get us a couple more beers.
You got it.
Thanks.
You know, I was thinking about retiring this year but now I can't go out like this.
Everything I've done before will just be forgotten.
Sammy, if you found out that you had players that were hazing, what would you do about it?
Used to be I wouldn't do anything but that all changed last year when I put behavior clauses in everybody's contract.
What do you mean?
Well, we had so many guys getting in trouble off the field, you know, getting arrested, driving their motorcycles through honey-baked ham stores, stuff like that.
So I put a thing in everyone's deal that says if they got caught doing any of that stuff that I can cut them.
No exceptions?
None.
The only thing they'd respond to was fear, fear of losing their money.
I think we should put that fear to work for us.
Well, Vlad's death is a horrible tragedy.
We're working with the Santa Barbara Police Department to help in any way that we can.
We voted as a team to continue to practice and to play and that is what we're going to do.
Thank you.
At least tell us who the kicker is going to be.
Thank you.
You know, I hope you know what you're doing, kid.
You got my career Hell, you got my legacy in your hands.
Sammy, you're just going to have to trust me, okay?
I'm going to fix this.
You didn't even look at the ball.
You ain't mad at it, though.
Come on!
Get off me, man.
What's your problem?
We're four weeks from our first game.
You still full of this?
Come on, baby.
Come on, focus, man.
Focus.
Dude, Matt and Drew are getting into it.
I think the pressure's getting to them.
Where are your John Stockton shorts?
They're not John Stockton shorts, Shawn.
I changed because I just got off the phone with Juliet.
She wants us to come down to the station right now.
Check this out, according to her, Vlad wasn't murdered.
What?
Say that again.
Use a Jamaican accent.
They said Vlad no murder.
The murder thing can't work.
No, man.
The man's feet Shawn.
All right, let's go.
And according to the coroner, Vlad's injuries were more consistent with those of a motor vehicle accident.
Well, my psychic wires are crossed then because I can see Vlad's body but I don't see any shards of glass or cuts on it anywhere.
Hmm.
Good catch.
I'm glad I called you.
Are you sure you didn't call me to see me in my uniform?
Because I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror earlier and I was like, what?
I didn't know they made pads in extra small.
Whoa.
Hey.
Dead Russian guy, possible homicidal football players.
Right.
Sorry, Gus.
Where did this come from?
They're Vlad's.
I'm getting something here.
Older Republican walruses.
That doesn't make any sense.
Everyone knows walruses are Libertarian.
Off Off Off-ligon?
Off Ricksberg?
Off On it Off Shawn.
Off-road warriors.
Off-road like ATV.
You know what?
ATVs don't have windshields.
We have to go.
All right, I think I know what happened but I need a little more proof.
I don't understand the big deal about the time of death.
It happened between 4:00 and That text came in five hours after he'd already died.
Would you send a threatening text message to someone hours after you supposedly killed them?
You would if you were starting to cover up.
What do you think you're going to find in Matt and Vince's locker?
Something that ties them directly to Vlad.
Looks like someone beat us to it.
It's not one of their lockers.
Whose is it?
It's mine.
Why did you even have to keep that stupid thing?
It's my only form of ID, Gus.
Hey.
Hey, bros, what's up?
What's up?
What's up is we know you're not a kicker.
You guys saw me nail a What the hell are you doing working for the cops?
Okay.
Okay.
So maybe I'm not a player.
I'm not a player but I crush a lot.
I would have bet money they would have gotten that reference.
I got it.
Thanks, buddy.
All right, the jig is up.
I'm a psychic.
I work for the cops.
You know what?
I'm tired of you messing with us.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
What was that?
I said I'm tired of you messing with us!
Not you.
It's Vlad.
He's speaking to me.
He's in a dark place.
It's hard to understand him.
He sounds a little like Yakov Smirnoff.
He also has some Ritz Bits in his mouth.
Cheese, no.
Peanut butter.
Shawn.
Okay, I'll tell 'em.
I I said I'd tell them.
All right, Vlad says he knows it's an accident.
Oh, I'm seeing through Vlad's eyes now.
He invited you to go ATV-ing down by the lake.
You were drinking.
There was a horrible accident where Vlad and Matt smashed into each other like two frozen Christmas hams.
Vlad wasn't wearing his helmet.
Hit his head on a rock and by the time we got there, he was dead.
Shut up, Drew.
Matt, you were thrown so violently from the ATV that the emergency switch tethered to your wrist left a burn, just like Vlad, and the foot The foot Just got ripped off in the middle of the accident.
But you weren't supposed to be doing any of that.
So you had to cover it up or risk losing your contracts.
And that's worth millions.
Smallpox, wrapping up the wrap-up.
What?
Putting a bow on it.
The pox may be small but decent.
Yeah, that's really very, very impressive, guys.
Too bad we've already dug ourselves so deep we can't let you ever tell anyone about it.
Then again, I could be dead wrong.
Yep.
I mean, I just I just heard it all from a locker.
What the hell does it know?
Seriously, here's what I think we should do, guys.
Gus.
Yep?
Run.
Gus, this way!
We'll use the phone in the press box!
Come on, Gus!
This is what we worked so hard for!
I was a training intern, Shawn!
Guess you guys didn't know about the elevator.
Get in!
Wait!
Get over there.
What are we doing, Matt?
Yeah, what are you doing, Matt?
Don't be rash and stupid now after you covered up the Vlad accident so nicely.
That's right.
I know.
I sensed a plan being hatched right there in the moment.
You knew Vlad was in trouble with the Russians, you just decided that would be the story.
You dumped Vlad's body in the lake and you left the foot right out there where you were sure it would be found.
You gave the cops exactly what they wanted.
It was the text, man.
The text to Vlad's phone afterwards.
That was overkill.
That's what cost you.
We have to get rid of them, Matt.
No, you don't.
We know you're not murderers.
It was just an accident.
Yeah.
That we covered up.
You can forget about our contracts.
Oh, man.
We're going to jail.
Jail's not so bad.
Have you guys seen Stir Crazy?
I bet they'll let you ride bulls.
All right, we'll take them up to the roof, make them jump.
It'll look like a hazing gone bad.
Come on.
No, no, no, no.
Whoa!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Let go of him!
Coach.
Son.
What are you doing here?
Watching film in the coach's box like he does every night before a game.
Yeah.
And I heard everything.
Coach, come on.
Think about this.
Giving up three of your starters for these guys.
Yeah.
You can't win without us.
You're probably right.
What?
But that doesn't matter anymore.
Shawn, you and your dad are people who love football so much you'd do anything to be close to it.
And that made me realize what's most important.
The game.
To hell with you, old man.
We'll just get rid of you too.
No, no, no, no!
Freeze!
Don't move.
Think I'd do all this without having backup?
I'm not stupid.
They don't give these badges to just anybody.
Feel it.
You guys did good.
I'm proud of you.
Oh, thanks, Sammy.
Well, it looks like you might need a few extra players for the season.
No.
But, you know It's not going to happen.
Hear me out.
Never.
Hello everyone, welcome to the Thunderdome for opening night, as hope springs eternal for coach Sammy Winslow and the T-Birds.
You know I can't believe I'm actually letting him do this.
You remember back then I told you he was a perceptive little pain in the butt?
I probably should have also told you that he is persistent as hell.
Ready?
Are you kidding me?
I've never been more ready for anything in my life.
Ready to lead them out, son.
Thunderbirds!
Yeah!
This is our house!
Yeah!
This is our time!
It's game time!
Gus, it's my day off.
The case is over.
What do you and Shawn want me to see anyway?
That.
Ladies and gentlemen, here come your Los Angeles Thunderbirds!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 13}{START OF EPISODE 14}
Shawn, what are you doing home from school?
Uh Uh, well, at the assembly today there was a guy and he hypnotized some students.
And one of them thought he was a kangaroo and he punched the guy and he passed out before he could put the kids back to normal.
Uh, but luckily Mr. Detmer, an ex-Navy SEAL, put everyone back before six kids had to go to the hospital.
Let me see the suspension note from the teacher.
How did you know?
Kid, I got a nickname at work, it's the Human Lie Detector.
I spend my day analyzing lies and the people who tell them.
Rule number one, every lie is built on a kernel of truth.
Take your little fib, for instance.
If I were to put money on it, I'd say the only true thing that you just said is that Mr. Detmer is ex-Navy SEAL.
You're right.
That's amazing.
Not really.
The relative specificity of that statement compared to the others made it obvious.
Look, Shawn, if you continue to lie like this nobody's going to believe you when it counts.
And that could put your life on the line.
Like maybe when I might be a cop?
No!
Like now.
Shawn Spencer thrives on clutch moments like this.
It's just him, the ball and the hole.
He's surrounded by silence.
And a man wearing a hefty bag on angel dust.
Come on, dude.
I was in the zone.
Now I have to start all over.
Shawn, the floor is flat.
I don't know why you can't just putt in our office.
Because Gus, anyone can hit a ball into an empty cup.
The true challenge is to guide the ball almost magically through the organized chaos of human bustle and into the hole as if no one were there.
Let's just hope it works better than when you attempted the same thing with the darts.
Pardon me, I nailed that, No.
You hit a guy's eye.
Shh!
Dude.
Stay alive.
What?
Get there.
Oh!
How about my phone call, huh?
You'll get your phone call.
I didn't do it.
You have to believe me.
Oh!
Who put a putting green in here?
He was already dead.
I was trying to resuscitate him.
Wait, wait, that guy.
The one with the great hair.
He can vouch for me.
I think we worked at Busch Gardens together one summer.
Yeah, we made funnel cakes.
Oh, look at that, Gus, he must have gotten me confused with another man with great hair.
And the white guy, I know him, too.
Save it, Ryan.
Hey, remember?
Just shut up!
Uh, Jules What's the story there?
Yeah?
That's Ryan Bainsworth, or Lyin' Ryan, as we call him around here.
He's a compulsive liar who is notorious for calling in tips and sending the department on wild goose chases.
He's pretty much an embarrassment to all of us.
How can you tell that someone's a compulsive liar?
I mean, assuming that their pants aren't on fire.
Trust me, we know.
Oh, come on, Jules.
We all tend to bend the truth just a little.
Not me.
Mmm-mmm.
Oh, really?
Does this ring a bell?
"No, Shawn, I have not had any naughty dreams about you.
" And, "Yes, Shawn, I do wish Gus was never born, so that I could be your partner.
" What?
True story.
That's messed up.
I never said that, Gus.
Anyway, Ryan usually comes in claiming to be a witness to a crime, but this time it looks like he's committed one.
Oh, Detective O'Hara, this is Dr. Morey, the DA's psychological expert.
Nice to meet you.
Here's the file on our suspect.
Thank you very much.
Don't mind them.
They're just here to observe.
She's right.
Please carry on.
When you're finished, I'd appreciate it if you'd evaluate my partner Gus.
For years he's been claiming to be insane in the membrane.
All right, why don't you just do us all a favor and write down in neat little letters all about how you stabbed and murdered your super in cold blood?
For the last time, I'm innocent.
I had asked my super to fix the garbage disposal.
I clogged it with cinnamon sticks and lemon wedges from a marinade.
Afterwards, he was to check my pipes because the polarity is completely off and the water drains counterclockwise, but by the time I got home, I found him there.
Dead.
Doctor, if I can speak for you.
I'd rather you didn't.
Look, all things being equal, I'd rather be scrapbooking right now, but that's not important.
Though I have been known to make a kickass collage.
Then maybe you'd like to tell me who did kill him.
Yes.
An assassin.
An assassin?
A hired assassin.
No, two of them, actually.
Yes, you see that has to be it.
The night before, I went to this restaurant to get a basket of these things called fries cuatro quesos, dos fritos.
You know, the ones where they inject potatoes with a four cheese mixture, fry them three quarters of the way, pull them out, batter them, fry them again and then serve them with bacon and an ancho chili sour cream.
Anyway, as I was sitting there, a car speeds right through the storefront across the street.
It makes such a loud noise, I had to turn my head and look and that is when I overheard the guy with the curly Q's on his face tell the other guy at the corner table about the assassination plot.
Can that be true?
No way.
I mean, is it even possible?
I couldn't imagine it.
There's no way you can prepare a fry like that.
That'd be way too much for the human palate to manage.
It would be a flavor seizure.
Gentlemen, please, don't be ridiculous.
She's right.
Let's just take a minute here, think things through.
They must be parboiling the potato first.
An assassination plot?
Seriously, how gullible do you think we are?
You have to believe me.
I'm 100% sure on this.
I clearly heard one of them say that they were going to kill someone with his belt buckle.
Ryan, come on.
They must have known that I overheard them.
That's why they were trying to kill me.
But they surprised the super in my apartment, got him instead.
And he tried to stop them.
They killed him.
How did they know where to find you, huh?
Because I was looking for them.
I was asking around, putting up flyers.
Oh, flyers.
Oh, well, that makes sense then.
You advertised for killers.
You have to believe me.
These are the guys that you want.
If you don't catch them, someone else is going to die, I swear to you.
I have a question.
No.
It's not a yes or no question.
What is the name of the restaurant that serves these alleged fries?
And might I substitute a garlic, lemon aioli?
Spencer, out.
Officer, if it helps any, I think substitutions are allowed.
So what do you think, Dr. Morey?
Well, he shows all the classic signs of an underlying pathology.
People like this lie in order to make themselves valuable.
Over time, when people stop believing their lies, they're forced to escalate their behavior in order to reclaim the attention.
Could he escalate it to the point of murder?
My professional opinion?
Please.
His police history and the circumstantial evidence of his fingerprints on the murder weapon and the victim's blood on his hands Hmm, yes, I think that should be enough to prosecute him.
Well that's too bad.
Why?
Because Lyin' Ryan is telling the truth this time.
Oh.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end And you're sure you want to take on the SBPD, an expert in forensic psychology and the DA's office?
Because they all believe he's guilty.
I certainly want to investigate further.
Every good liar's lies are rooted in a kernel of truth.
This isn't even our case.
Are you trying to show up the police department?
Is this about pride?
Gus, I got these jeans at a garage.
Not a garage sale, a garage.
Clearly, pride is not an issue for me.
This is about me not wanting a man to be wrongfully convicted because he has a sickness that he cannot control.
Plus, he appreciated my hair.
No, he appreciated my hair.
He was lying.
He's a compulsive liar, that's what they do.
Come on, try to play Catch Up.
Uh, why don't you play, Investigate This on Your Own?
Fine.
Stay here, wash the dishes in those ridiculous gloves.
I'm going to the restaurant that he said had cheese infused twice battered fries.
I'll drive.
Enjoy!
The fries exist, Shawn.
He was telling the truth in a big way.
They're like a pyramid of savory goodness.
Let's just sit here and look at them for a while.
Dude, this feels like a family establishment, doesn't it?
I'm not sure two ruthless hired gunmen would frequent a place like A car speeds right through the storefront window across the street, that made me turn my head.
this.
Uh, excuse us.
Uh-huh.
Do you remember if there were two threatening looking guys sitting at the table in the corner yesterday?
Oh, my gosh.
Yes!
How did you know that?
He's psychic.
Oh, oh!
Do you do parties?
Private ones, yes.
Were you thinking of throwing a little something together for yourself?
Uh, no.
My niece, she's turning six.
Not available for that.
Uh, do you by chance remember overhearing anything they said?
No the only thing they said to me was when they ordered.
A beer and a cup of hot water with cinnamon sticks and lemon wedges.
I clogged it with cinnamon sticks and lemon wedges from a marinade.
But they were totally creepy.
Scared the heck out of the hostess.
Yeah, I saw those guys.
Definitely, very creepy.
The one with the weird handlebar mustache.
And that is when I overheard the guy with the curly Q's on his face.
Handlebar mustache?
Like the Hamburglar?
No, no, no.
That was Mayor McCheese.
He had the 'stache.
Burglar had the mask.
Right, right.
Then there was Grimace.
That brother was funny.
What?
No, no, no, no, no.
Excuse us.
I gave you Vin Diesel.
Gave me?
You're not claiming Grimace as a brother.
Grimace is a brother.
He's an amorphous mass.
He's like a big amoeba.
He's a black amoeba, Shawn.
Purple.
Anyway When I seated them, I saw a bulge under his suit jacket.
Like from a gun on his belt.
They were going to kill someone with his belt buckle.
I think I'm starting to understand how Ryan works.
When people stop believing their lies, they're forced to escalate their behavior in order to reclaim the attention.
I'm sorry.
Anything else?
No, but you guys should talk to Carl, the valet.
He had a really weird story.
Thank you.
What color was Grimace?
What?
Black.
Yeah, those creepy dudes.
They were talking a lot about money or something.
Then one of them slips the other one a bag of cash, but then they give me a 50 cent tip.
You know, it really pisses me off when folks are too cheap to even shell out for a dollar.
I hear that.
Take care of yourself.
Mr. Spencer, Mr. Guster.
What are you doing here?
Well, Chief, if you must know.
I must.
We are going to speak with Ryan because the psychic bone in this finger is telling me that he is not lying about the hit men, which means he may also be telling the truth about the assassination plot.
And if we don't follow up on it, even though it seems pretty thin, someone could die.
What?
No, I will.
I will tell her that because it's spot on.
Chief, that is a very smart pantsuit.
I'm not having a conversation with your pinkie.
Okay, one last question.
Loehmann's or Talbots?
Even if I did believe you, which I don't, I have been down this road with Ryan too many times.
Now, unless you have some concrete proof of something, you and your pinkie are banned from wasting any department resources on any information coming from Ryan Bainsworth.
Fair enough!
We will find you something concrete.
Thank you.
Good news, we have an ingenious plan.
Ingenious.
Huh.
So, maybe you'd like to turn and face another direction.
Preferably away from Ryan's holding cell.
You're not speaking to him.
This is not a case for you.
Go home.
Oh!
Oh, us.
We should We go home.
Thank you.
No, no.
You didn't do anything wrong.
It's not your fault.
His name was Grimace Jackson, Shawn.
Grimace T. Jackson.
You're ridiculous.
Whatever.
How are we going to get into Ryan's apartment to check it out?
Follow my lead.
Hiya.
Hello.
May I help you?
Perhaps.
My name is Shawn Spencer, I'm with the Big Uncles of America program.
This is my underprivileged mentee, Hollaback Atcha.
He's selling magazine subscriptions as a way to learn business skills.
Otherwise, he'd be forced to join a gang if he was still on the streets.
If I were still out on the street, I'd be an OG.
You wish.
Okay, just don't tell anyone I let you in.
Oh, thank you very much.
Now what exactly are we looking for?
Evidence.
Evidence to corroborate the story.
Check it out.
Look at the way the blood sprayed along the wall.
Just look.
What?
The aortic spatter?
Sure.
It means that the super's aortic artery was punctured during the murder.
The built up blood pressure causes different kinds of Wow.
Some of us like to be prepared, Shawn.
No, no.
When Ryan came into the station, he only had blood on his hands.
If he had killed the super, wouldn't it have sprayed all over his clothes, too?
Oh, no!
Oh, my gosh.
Oh, oh!
That means that the super was in the wrong place at the really, really wrong time.
The assassins took him out thinking he was Ryan.
How did they know where to find you, huh?
Because I was looking for them.
I was asking around, putting up flyers.
That means Ryan's telling the truth.
Which also means that there's someone else out there with a target on their back.
Gus, look!
Ryan really did work at Busch Gardens.
Is that what he thinks good hair looks like?
I think that's Koko B. Ware.
Shawn, come on.
Look, he's letting Ryan shoulder the parrot.
Where are we going to find these so-called assassins?
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
But Ryan's the only one that can help us find them.
Even if they did exist, the Chief was emphatic when she said, she does not want us talking to Ryan while he's in police custody.
Bingo.
Don't say bingo.
Cranium.
Now, I'll play some Cranium.
How much do we have in the Psych savings account?
I really hate it when you ask that question.
Thank you very much.
What are you doing here?
Dapper Dan!
Just going to pay a visit to our old buddy Ryan.
You were given direct orders to stay away from him.
Yeah, we don't take orders well.
No.
Unless they're to get on the dance floor.
Or raise the roof.
Make some noise with a "Z".
You know what?
Just forget I asked, okay?
Sorry.
What is it, the first day with the new feet?
He spent all day in court waiting to testify on a case and the defense attorney didn't show up again.
But he's right, you guys can't communicate with Ryan while he's in custody.
I guess it's a good thing he's no longer in custody.
Seeing as how we just posted his bail.
Looks like paper.
Actually our life savings.
Bye, bye.
Hey, you guys want lunch?
You know I own a restaurant downtown.
Actually, it's not all mine.
I co-own it with Mike Ditka.
You guys eat wild game, don't you?
Once we find the real killers, the police will believe us.
Us?
What us?
I'm not convinced you didn't kill that dude.
Blood splatter is a subjective science.
It was the assassins, I'm telling you.
And if we don't stop them, they're going to kill again.
I think Ryan has a point.
Is there a Kinko's nearby?
We should make some new flyers.
What information do you actually have?
I don't know if it's enough, but I did overhear a time, a place, and a name.
Come again.
I know who, what and where.
Ryan, that That's everything we need to know.
That's all of it.
Why didn't you just say that in the first place?
Because no one would let me.
That's true, Gus, that's very true.
Yeah, I got that, Shawn.
Just go ahead, Ryan.
The time was 10:00.
To 4:30.
Yeah.
A six hour window?
What, do your killers work at the cable company?
It's okay.
What's the place?
Four twenty Four twenty-something.
I didn't get a street name or an apartment number, but the address definitely has a 420 in it.
Hmm.
But the name I have.
Perfect.
What is it?
Tom.
Tom?
You wouldn't happen to have a last name, would you?
Come on, guys!
I can't do everything for you.
Oh, I'm teaching a water aerobics class in 20 minutes.
I've got to go.
Go?
We just bailed you out of jail.
Ryan, it's okay.
I trust you.
Do your thing.
We'll let you know when we have something.
Perfect.
I will have one of my assistants track me down wherever I am.
Count on it!
Okay Don't worry, Gus.
We'll travel faster without him.
All right, fine.
Every liar has a tell.
So, why Sure he's good, but if you listen, it's there.
All right, would you Let's head back to the office.
Will you stop Of course, we're going to stop for tacos on the way.
Thank you.
I'm sorry.
What time do you close?
Well, if you're closed already, why are you answering the phone?
Dude, the clock is ticking on some guy's life and you're out getting a milkshake?
Gus, don't be this crevice in my arm.
This isn't a milkshake, it's a smoothie.
There's a huge difference.
And I was going around the neighborhood checking all the places that are open from 10:00 to 4:30 and by blind luck one of them just happened to be the only juice bar in Santa Barbara that offers blueberries in the mist with açaí and goji berries.
I didn't order that.
This is the normal blueberries in the mist.
How did you do?
I've got a list of all the addresses in Santa Barbara that begin with 420.
There are over 700 possibilities, Shawn.
Four twenty, first street, 420, second street, you get the drift.
Wow.
I guess next we'll have to comb through apartments and suites, too.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry, Shawn, but I never fully believed Ryan in the first place.
I was going along with your gut as usual.
And I have a non-negotiable distance limit on those trips.
I have a real job.
Are you telling me you would rather sell pharmaceuticals than foil an assassination plot and clear an innocent man that's been accused of murder?
Innocent man?
We just took on the world's most unreliable client.
I get the feeling I'm going to need all the commissions I can get.
I'll be spending the next six weeks praying he doesn't skip out on his hearing, so we can get our bail money back.
You can get bail money back?
Well, what am I supposed to do?
I don't know.
Call the Human Lie Detector.
Okay, Ryan.
Just tell him exactly what you told the police.
Oh, I killed the super of my building.
What?
That's not That's not true at all.
Well, the Santa Barbara Police Department seems to think it's true.
Otherwise, why did they arrest me?
Shawn, if this guy says that he's guilty, what the hell am I doing here?
He's lying.
Wait, he's lying about lying?
Yes.
No.
I Ryan!
Ryan, tell him about the assassins.
The creepy assassins with the handlebar mustache and the plot and the counterclockwise water, please.
Assassins?
Counterclockwise water?
Really, Shawn, if I said that, I would sound crazy.
Dude, you are crazy.
You're way off the reservation, that's why I'm trying to keep you out of jail.
When you lie, does that make you feel important?
Because if you keep lying the way you do, no one will believe you when it counts.
I will slap you in the face.
Oh, violence is not the answer.
I would say that you are the second most sane person in this room.
Ryan, would you excuse us for just a minute?
Oh, yeah.
Don't wander off.
All right, Shawn.
Why are you working so hard on this one?
I work hard on all my cases.
I know you do.
You work hard to have fun, to show off.
Look, I'm not an idiot.
I know this guy's got a screw loose.
He's lying out his ass.
What I don't understand is why you're taking this one so seriously.
I guess because nobody, including the police, believes him.
I know what's going on here.
Oh, really?
Yes, I do.
Shawn, listen to me.
You are not Ryan.
Yeah, you stretch the truth a little bit sometimes, but at least you know where the line is.
Of course, I know where the line is.
But only because of two things.
One, you always had somebody around who knew when you were lying and bothered to call you on it.
What's the second thing?
Well, I'd like to say that you always had enough natural talent to fall back on.
But I'd be lying.
Listen to me, kid.
If you ever drag my ass down here again to do Guster's job, I'm going to hit you up with a consulting fee.
Okay, good night, Captain.
What was that?
That was me saving your life.
From my dad?
We don't know who we can trust.
We've got to stay low.
Low.
I have a face guy who can disguise us, get us out of the country if need be.
He's Yeah, he's probably going to have to break your nose, but remember, this is what you signed up for.
Stop it!
What?
This is real.
Your life is in danger.
Okay?
Even Batman takes off the cape and the cowl when he's in the Batcave with Alfred, so just pretend like I'm Alfred and you be Ryan Wayne.
It's them!
It's them!
Don't get it!
Hold on.
Don't!
Hello?
Shawn, I can't believe I'm making this call, but I figured it out.
I'm standing at 420 Main Street.
And guess what it is?
A hospital.
Spencer, what the hell?
Are you all right?
Yeah, of course I am.
Why?
Well, we got the message that you were at the hospital, something about life and death?
Oh, right, that.
Well, we are in a hospital and, as it happens, it's filled with both life and death.
I knew, I should have left that message.
What's going on, Spencer?
Ryan and I spent some quality time in a psychic sweat lodge.
Toweled.
Fully.
And I have had a clear vision of the absolute truth.
The target of the assassination is right down the hall.
His name is Tom.
Tom Lieber.
And he needs police protection.
Is this more of your bullcrap, Bainsworth?
Because in addition to your murder charge, I'm pretty sure we have enough to charge you with reckless disregard of police resources.
You two, as well.
More than enough grounds.
Wait, no, you have to believe us!
Ah!
You're killing me!
You're killing me!
Freeze!
Perfect timing.
I'm dead.
Thanks a lot.
You.
Out.
No, no, no, no!
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Get out.
Spencer, thank you once again for completely wasting my time.
Once again, just last week I gave you the tip about the twice yearly sale at T.J. Maxx.
Racks and racks of $7 ties.
Wasting your time?
I don't think so.
What's going on?
Is this about the accident?
Because I still don't remember it.
What accident?
I hit a car.
You mean you were hit by a car?
No, I hit one.
Or at least that's what they told me.
I don't remember any of it.
Why would I even want to hit a Buick?
I don't have anything against Buicks.
Carlton, look at this.
Sir, are you suffering from amnesia?
Yeah.
Maybe.
I think.
Or something like that.
Great.
Leave it to Lyin' Ryan to find the only amnesiac in Santa Barbara.
Although, I won't be the only amnesia person much longer, I'm getting my memory back.
A little bit each day.
Look, Lieber.
Tom.
I never forgot that.
How wonderful for you.
We think you may be in grave danger.
No, we don't.
Yes, we do.
This side of the room, the cool side Sorry, Jules.
think that How How do we Someone may be trying to kill you.
Are you blackmailing anyone?
Are you having a torrid affair?
Are you part of Treadstone?
Wait, don't answer the last question.
Oh, wow, no.
No.
I work from home, receiving and processing complaints for a mattress manufacturer.
On Tuesdays, I go out and get new games, maybe throw in a trip to which must have been where I was going Oh, just after 6:00.
Anapamu Street.
I would have been there right after the What?
My games.
All over the street.
How great would those have been during my convalescence?
Okay, this is fascinating.
Spencer, make-believe time's over.
We got real police work to do.
By the way, you're still a long ways off from connecting anyone other than Ryan to the murder of that super.
Hey, Chief, what do you got?
Shawn, what are we doing?
Ryan lied to us again.
He made us look like fools again.
And now we're standing in the room with a guy who literally knows nothing.
No offense, Tom.
No, none taken.
Visiting hours ended hours ago.
You gentlemen need to finish your business now.
Oh, our business is definitely finished.
Trust me.
Tom, I do hope you remember stuff.
Yeah.
No, no, no, you got it.
We'll be there in ten.
I certainly hope you didn't make dinner reservations at Souplantation.
Gus and I have already eaten.
I suppose we could go around the corner and watch you eat, if you'd like.
They just found a body in a vacant office suite on the corner of Gardner and Carrillo.
Really?
Any ID?
You're not going to believe this, it is the defense attorney on the case we've been trying to give testimony on all week.
Huh.
What about Ryan's assassins?
You should call either the Loch Ness monster or Bigfoot if you get in trouble.
I'm sure they'd be happy to help.
First of all Bigfoot and I haven't spoken in five years.
Six if you don't count his cousin's wedding, which was literally like, "Hey, B." Come on, Jules, you know me and I know people.
I can read them.
You know that.
I have spent enough time with Ryan to know when he's lying and when he's telling the truth.
And there is a kernel of truth in every one of his stories so they cannot be dismissed.
Neither can he.
He's a person.
A person is more than the tales that they tell.
Yeah, well, right now he's more than just a person.
He's a doctor.
You know they say we doctors have a God complex.
But after seven years of neurosurgery, I say we have a complex God.
Look on the bright side, Spencer, you keep up this losing streak, you'll become completely useless to the department.
I know, we haven't eaten.
Shawn, we are treading on thin ice right now.
Yes, but I'm about to do a double axle into a Salchow and finish with a sweet little camel toe.
You mean camel spin.
I've heard it both ways.
I'm right about the Ryan thing.
No, you are obsessed with this Ryan thing.
And, dude, if your psychic powers disappear, Vick won't need to hire us anymore.
There's no way we can subsist on the private jobs we get.
How many times must we go through this?
I am this close to getting on the Pro Bowlers Tour.
I am not doing this.
Okay.
I get it.
We have to make nice with the Chief.
Why do you think I brought along this peace offering?
You really think that one container of fries cuatro quesos, dos fritos is going to fix everything?
Yes, I do.
The lawyer had two slugs in his chest.
Ballistics is checking the system for matches.
Any trace?
Nothing yet.
The lab's going to call the second they find anything.
Oh, not now, gentlemen.
We are in the middle of a homicide investigation.
And don't think I don't know that you've been wasting my detectives' time chasing leads, once again supplied by Ryan Bainsworth.
Chief.
Chief Vick.
Hmm.
Chief Karen Charles Vick.
Here.
Ooh!
It's a fries cuatro quesos, dos fritos and apparently doesn't travel well.
The point is we are sorry for making Lassiter and Juliet run around town on wild goose chases.
Shawn's psychic powers have been a tad on the fritz.
The good news is they're back to 100% working order and we are fully available to help on this murder case you are now on.
Even more good news, those taste better than they look.
Yes, they do.
Fine.
Apology accepted.
And my middle name is not Charles.
I took a shot.
I knew it was a C. Now about this defense attorney's murder case, any victim of an assassination plot?
Wow, really?
As odd as it sounds, it actually did cross my mind.
So I checked it out and I can say with certainty that he is not the victim of Mr. Bainsworth's assassination plot.
The coroner puts time of death at four days ago and a recently discovered witness who heard shots at 6:00 that evening confirms it.
Which means the lawyer was killed before Ryan allegedly overheard these men planning a hit.
Our victim would have already been dead at that point.
No need to kill him again.
Unless he was a zombie.
Chief?
Yes.
The surveillance video from the backdoor of the garage near the scene of the crime came in, it's corrupted.
There's not much of it.
Hey, are those the fries cuatro quesos?
Yes, they are.
They don't travel well.
O'Hara, set it up.
Let's take a look.
Wait, dude, she said the lawyer died four days ago.
Yes.
It's over, Shawn.
Four days ago was Tuesday.
That means the lawyer got killed in a building on Gardner Street on the same day that Lieber got hit by a car on Anapamu.
Not just the same day, the same time, around 6:00 p. m. And those streets are only two blocks away.
Ryan, the lawyer, Lieber, they're all connected somehow.
Come on.
Fries.
Sorry to interrupt.
I just got a very strong vibe that you're about to apologize to us.
In what world would we ever apologize to you?
Wayne's, maybe Dave's, it's a small Spencer.
I believe this DVD will prove that Ryan and I have been right all along.
No, who's that?
O'Hara, rewind that.
No way!
That's Tom Lieber.
That's the kid that Bainsworth led us to at the hospital, Chief, and he's running away from where the body was found.
Well, I guess you were right, Mr. Spencer, Lieber must have killed the lawyer and then got hit by the car as he fled the scene.
Ooh, I don't know, the spirits are a little cloudy on that part, Chief.
I'm sorry for the spirits, but we don't have time for gray areas.
Detectives, I want you to get to that hospital right now.
From what I understand Lieber is regaining his memory and the second he remembers what he did, he could run.
Come on, let's go.
Got it.
She knows she's not going to eat that.
What?
I don't think Lieber's the killer.
I saw something on the tape.
Hold on.
There.
Right there.
He stops and looks back over his shoulder.
Why?
Because someone is chasing him.
Two creepy someones, to be exact.
Lieber didn't kill the lawyer, but he saw who did.
Ryan's assassins.
They chased him into traffic and they thought that was the end of it.
But then the newspaper reports that he survived, goes into a coma, wakes up with amnesia, the killers think they still have a window.
But today's paper said he's regaining his memory.
So Ryan overheard the real killers plotting to take out Lieber.
We have got to get back to the hospital and tell Lassy and Jules that these guys are coming back to clean up their own mess.
Come on!
What was his condition, now, did he seem Yeah, Dawson, I need an APB out on a Thomas Lieber.
He's wanted for questioning in a murder.
Get his picture from the DMV.
Where's Lieber?
Gone.
Looks like he's on the lamb.
If he's on a lamb, he won't get far.
Alpaca, different story.
Those things really fly.
You two don't need to be here.
It's not true, Lassy.
Lieber didn't kill the lawyer.
He witnessed Ryan's assassins do the deed and now they've clearly come back to get him.
And I promise I will ask all about your insane little theories once I put them both in jail.
Come on, Gus.
Let's find Tom.
I should have been onto this way earlier.
I can't believe I didn't make the connection.
We don't know that Lieber's dead, Shawn.
Maybe he remembered and left before the killers could find him.
Hey, guys!
They're right behind us!
They're going to kill us!
Drive!
Drive!
Okay, enough with the seat belts!
Just drive!
They're right behind us!
Where did you learn to drive?
All right, now you want to keep this upright.
I'm sorry.
I had to take matters into my own hands.
I snuck Lieber out the ambulance bay and when I saw you guys pull up I knew we could hide in the car.
Incoming!
So, wait, you just took him out of the hospital?
Well, I had to act quickly.
Tom started to remember everything.
Well, not everything, really.
Yet.
And the killers, the killers were already in the building.
It was like a game of cat and mouse trying to get out of there unseen.
Didn't we just use the elevator?
Would you please let me tell the story?
He's parking, he's parking, he's parking!
Very nice, partner.
Just weaved your way through those obstacles like a ferret on roller skates or Hey, what are you doing?
Why are we slowing down?
No, no, no.
Gus.
What are you doing?
Dude, the killers are right behind us!
Nobody's following us, Shawn.
And there never was.
The only thing I know for sure right now is that we are harboring two fugitives.
Okay, Gus, look, I believe Ryan, but I understand why you don't.
I maxed you out in the blind faith department and that's fair so you don't have to believe him.
Just keep believing in me.
Come on, buddy.
That's them!
That's them!
That's them!
That's the guys from the restaurant!
It's coming back to me.
They shot that man!
Drive!
Drive!
Hey, Gus, drive!
I'm gonna kill you, Shawn!
Get down!
We got to get out of here!
We're sitting ducks!
Everybody run!
Run, run, run!
Go, run!
Serpentine!
Serpentine!
Zigzag!
Hide in here!
What are you doing?
We're never going to make it!
Not at a complete stop, we won't!
Doctor, this bag is empty.
Is that important?
I'll hold them off.
Get him back to the hospital.
Hopefully Lassy and Jules are still there.
Hold them off, how?
I don't know.
I'll think of something, I always do!
So do I. Shawn.
Just get him out of here.
He's the one that has to make it.
Then I'm going to kill you, Shawn.
I'll give you every opportunity to do that, buddy.
We accept the terms of your surrender.
Uh, you mean you're surrendering.
Yeah.
We're the ones holding the guns here.
Well You and the 20 or so cops that are waiting in lie around that corner.
Plus, hasn't there been enough bloodshed already?
I mean first the lawyer, then Ryan's poor super.
You guys are terrible at cleaning up after yourselves.
Yeah, and you're lying about the backup.
Look into my eyes and tell me if I'm lying.
There's no backup.
They were telling the truth.
Apparently so.
That's a good looking handlebar.
I wonder who his mustache guy is.
Down on the ground, cowboy.
That's better.
Oh, good, you're both here.
Whoa, let me guess, there's a bomb on a bus and if it goes below 50 miles per hour the whole thing's going to explode!
No, no, no more lies.
I am quitting cold turkey, turning over a new leaf.
Really?
No more Lyin' Ryan.
No.
Just like you said, I am going to be just Ryan.
If you hadn't believed me an innocent person would have ended up dead.
And all because I became a guy who couldn't be taken at his word.
So I just wanted to come here to thank you before I took off.
Well, if it's any consolation, I believed you from the very beginning.
Especially since you recognized I have great hair.
I was talking about him.
You were lying.
It's okay.
I forgive you.
I'm coming around.
So where are you off to?
This is unbelievable.
I got tapped to captain a hot air balloon in a multi-state regatta.
I take off tomorrow.
Hot air balloons have captains?
Oh, yeah.
Of course they have captains.
Captains, first mates, deck hands, I got really lucky.
It was a friend of a friend of mine, kind of thing.
If you guys ever want a ride, I mean come on, I owe you.
I'll even let you steer the thing, just don't tell anyone, okay?
Take care of yourselves.
Man, I am glad he is out of our life.
That's ridiculous.
Hot air balloon?
That's crazy though, right?
Yeah.
It's not possible.
Do you think he would really let us steer?
There's only one way to find out.
You said you weren't going to fall for any more of his stories.
No, I didn't.
Whatever!
I knew you were lying.
You're a liar.
Shotgun.
How am I a liar?
You can't call shotgun on a hot air balloon, Shawn!
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 14}{START OF EPISODE 15}
Hey, Shawn, over here, buddy!
Hey, how about a big hello for your old man you haven't seen in a week?
Hi, old man.
Can we go now?
No.
Where's Gus?
I think he got abducted.
No, there he is.
Hey, Gus!
Perfect.
Step on it.
You two didn't team up on the piñata contest this year, did you?
No.
He ditched me for golden boy Jason Cunningham who wins every year and I got stuck with the kid who wore the jacket the entire week.
It's a million degrees out, why don't you go live on Hoth, you freak?
You keep the piñata.
Okay, well, you keep the ribbon, Killer B. I insist.
Hi, Mr. Spencer.
Hey, Gus, hop in.
All right.
Hey, Killer B, if you're looking for your pocket knife, it's still in my back.
Where's your clown piñata?
It's not a clown.
And wouldn't you like to know?
Camp Tikihama Oh, what you are Reaches near and reaches far From white capped mountains To crystal lakes Sing out loud for Tiki's sake Camp Tikihama you're so true We'll come back and we'll love you Who are you?
What are you doing?
That's what you get for being a harlot, thank you very much.
What do you want?
Hello?
Is somebody there?
I have a bat.
Phew!
Hello?
Oh, Sissy, thank God.
No, I'm fine.
It's just so quiet when you're here all alone.
I took some cold medicine.
I think my eyes are playing tricks on me.
No, no, no, you guys go have fun.
I'm just going to drink some tea and hit the sack.
Tomorrow I will be as good as new.
Okay.
Bye.
Oh.
Beyond awful.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end Dude, I'm telling you, you cannot add lettuce.
It completely takes you out of the burrito.
You don't seem to mind if a taco has lettuce.
That's because everyone knows the taco has assimilated, Gus.
The burrito remains authentic.
It's the Rollie Fingers of Mexican cuisine.
Oh, my God.
What the Isn't that your Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
That's my Rick Astley piñata.
I think it's dead.
Rick Astley?
That's what that thing was supposed to be?
Oh, come on.
You sound like the judges.
Look at it.
It's painfully obvious, even now.
It looks more like Ann-Margret.
What?
I had it narrowed down to Eric Stoltz or Boris Becker.
Jason Cunningham?
Killer B. What's up, man?
Salmon run.
Shawn, it's good to see you.
Cunningham.
Who would make an Eric Stoltz piñata?
That doesn't make any sense.
And what are you thinking, man?
Children walk by here every day carrying their hopes and dreams.
My sincerest apologies.
I couldn't resist.
We found it when we dredged the lake.
Dredged the lake?
You went back to Camp Tikihama?
Yeah.
Been there and I bought it.
What?
Yeah.
I'm reopening it Friday.
Let's take a walk.
Sure.
All right, what's the rub here, Cunningham?
I know you didn't track us down after 20 years to tell us that Friday the Hey, look, I read the paper.
All right, you guys uncovered a dinosaur and rescued a mummy in the same calendar year.
I need your help, as detectives and as old friends.
We're sort of missing a counselor.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What does that What does that even mean, "sort of missing"?
I know what you're thinking and there are a million possible explanations.
Her name is Annie, she's kind of a loner.
She's a hiker and she never tells us where she's going.
I don't say this very often, but it sounds like one for the proper authorities.
Are you kidding?
I call the cops and the press gets a hold of this, they'll go crazy.
The camp murder stories will start all over and I'll be dead in the water before I ever open.
Shawn, please.
Look, I poured 20 grand into this.
All right?
It's all I've got.
Look, I'm sorry, Cunningham, but my gut is saying no in THX.
Shawn.
If you can't do it for that poor girl or an old friend with a good heart, do it for the children.
It's kids.
It's for the kids.
I don't want to.
Just do it for the kids.
I don't want to.
All right.
May I help you, Detective?
Just thought these might brighten the place up a bit.
Wow.
What a wonderful sentiment for you to buy these for me.
Actually I bought four just to have options, but these were by far and away the worst ones.
Supposed to be poisonous.
Tried to give them to the lady down in fingerprinting, but turns out she's a man.
From birth.
I see, well, thank you, I guess.
You're welcome.
Here, you get to choose between these two.
They didn't make the cut either.
Be careful, though, one of them is expired.
May I ask what brought on this generosity?
Yes, you may.
I have a very special dinner date this evening with my estranged wife.
You're reconciling?
Things have been pretty good between us lately.
We've been friendly.
Beyond friendly.
I've been asking her to go to Gerard's for months and she's finally accepted.
Wow.
Gerard's, that's a surprisingly chic choice, Detective.
That's where we had our first date.
Back then it was a greasy spoon.
I had diarrhea for a long while.
They actually changed some health codes because of it.
But new beginnings and all.
You get the connection.
Well, I really, truly wish you the best, Carlton.
Thank you.
But maybe you should be a little cautious here.
How so?
You know, the whole eggs in the basket, jumping with both feet thing.
Hey, you're a woman, is it too early to bring up kids?
Man, this place brings back so many bad memories.
Shawn, you need to let the piñata thing go.
We were 11, I wanted to win.
It wasn't about winning or losing, Gus.
It was about you and me being an unflappable two-headed pre-teen phenomenon.
Like the Mowry twins, sticking together no matter what.
You're all doomed!
All right, we're out of here.
Shawn, stop it.
He's kidding.
Look at him.
Yeah, clearly.
He has a folksy sense of humor.
The Garrison Keillor of Tikihama.
Turn around before we get stabbed.
Where is he going?
I don't know.
This doesn't feel right, man.
We should not be here.
Look, let's just get it done.
We'll find the girl and get home for some Burn and Vertes in a couple hours.
My treat.
Excuse me.
Is Jason around?
We're old friends of his.
I think he's inside trying to figure out what's eating Gilbert Grape.
Turns out it was a flesh eating virus.
Oh, I get it.
You're the funny guy.
You guys must be counselors.
I'm Clive, in charge of all water activities or anything wet.
Billy.
Fitness, nutrition, body sculpting.
I'm a bit of a fitness buff myself.
I'm training for the Santa Barbara 1 K. That's only about 3,000 feet.
There's not a lot of training involved.
Hello!
Oh, please don't do this.
Do what?
Every time you see a marginally cute girl you lose all semblance of reason.
I don't do that.
Just like you don't flick your nose with your thumb when you're trying to act cool.
Jason, we made it.
What the hell happened to him?
He's fine.
Those are nurse's shoes.
They're probably very comfortable.
They're both left feet.
Hello Burton, Shane, so glad you could drop by.
I had some biscuits in the oven, but I forgot to light the pilot.
Jason, are you feeling okay?
I'm super.
Did I tell you about the biscuits?
My name is Shawn Spencer.
I'm psychic.
This is my partner Lumpkin My name is Gus.
But you can call me Slicks.
Slicks?
What's your name?
Sissy, arts and crafts.
How are you?
Good.
Thank you.
Anyway, we are here to help track down your missing counselor.
I thought you said Annie called.
I thought she would call, but she hasn't.
She hasn't called, but we're sure she's fine.
Jason, what haven't you told them?
You guys are aware that this is Billy, let's keep our business, our business.
Okay?
This is just about Annie.
Now, show them the camp house.
What's with the doll?
It's for the kids, Shawn.
And I know what you're doing, you're trying to interpret everything as creepy just because you're jealous of Jason.
Let's just get this over with.
This place is musty.
It's vintage, Shawn.
Hello, Sissy.
Hi, Slicks.
This is the last place we know Annie was for sure.
I talked to her on the phone last night.
She wasn't feeling well at all.
Well, then, my guess is that she didn't get up at the crack of dawn and go for a hike.
So you guys really came here when you were kids, huh?
Well, you know how it is, do the bunk bed thing, make some lanyards, catch a fish.
Go home early because some repair man got electrocuted in the swimming pool and the camp closed.
Oh, my God!
That really happened?
Yes.
It was a tragic accident.
And it happened 20 years ago.
Gus, grab your suit.
What is that?
Laundry shack.
Who's doing laundry?
Not me.
We're not supposed to use the dryer.
It drains too much energy and our generator's messed up.
Those are Annie's pajamas.
Doesn't mean anything.
She could be fine.
Billy's right.
Maybe she was painting a fire engine and decided to go for a swim.
This is not paint, Shawn.
Who could do something like this?
Anybody for the toothless old guy on the rusty Schwinn?
You mean the janitor?
Janitor?
Take a look around.
I really don't think you're getting your money's worth.
Crazy old Erwen.
Erwen wouldn't hurt a fly.
Would anybody like some tea?
Maybe something black?
You don't have to decide now, I'll just put some on.
Okay, what is that about?
Tea isn't the worst idea ever.
It's a great stress reducer.
This cycle just started, which means whoever did this is close.
I say we go looking for him.
Clive?
Define "looking for" because I don't really feel like losing any of my extremities.
We stay within shouting distance.
We meet back at the office at 6:00.
Nobody's one minute late.
You got me?
Let's twist this.
You guys aren't going to let me go alone, are you?
Yes, we are.
Of course not.
We were actually thinking of staying here in the laundry shack.
Really scoping this place out with a fine-toothed comb.
Oh, please, Gus, Annie could be out there somewhere.
I hear you.
She's right, Shawn.
Annie needs us.
Excuse him.
We've never met Annie.
She could be a terrible person.
We've suddenly have fallen into some kind of slasher movie scenario and we're making all the classic mistakes!
We stay here, shut the door, wait for help.
At least take something pointy.
Annie!
Annie!
It'll be okay, Sissy.
I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for all of this.
No, there isn't.
But I appreciate your attempt to put me at ease.
I'm literally shaking over here.
Don't worry.
They call me fearless Guster.
I And there's plenty more where that came from!
Annie?
Annie?
Is somebody there?
Huh?
I'm right here!
Hello.
May I help you, sir?
I certainly hope so.
I have a reservation under Carlton Lassiter and spouse.
Your reservation is for 7:00 p. m. That's right.
It's 5:20.
Yeah, well, parking wasn't quite the rattlesnake I'd anticipated.
Well, sir, none of our wait staff has arrived as of yet, but I can assure you the table will be ready at 7:00, sharp.
I'll wait.
You're going to stand here?
I'm a peace officer.
I'm practiced in surveillance.
I can remain motionless for up to eight hours if need be.
The bar is also open, if you'd prefer to sit.
Oh, that's good, too.
Victoria.
I was kind of nervous so I got here early.
Me, too.
Hello?
Shawn?
Jules.
Wow.
You made really good time.
Shawn, are you hiding in that closet?
No.
No, I'm not.
That's a negative.
How have you been?
Okay, this is weird.
Here's the thing, Jules, and I wouldn't possibly have expected you to know this, but sometimes the psychic headlights can get a little bright and I have to balance that effervescence with dark space.
Closets are very good, coffins are great.
Shawn, you sounded really spooked on the phone.
What's going on?
Yeah, solid question and I'm going to bring you up to speed, but first, would you mind coming back in and catching me doing some inverted sit-ups or perhaps lifting a large anvil over my head?
Where's Billy?
I don't know.
We split up.
Well, did you find anything?
I stumbled upon Erwen's living quarters and I mean that loosely.
Gus, there you are.
Look who I found.
What the I'm Clive.
I'm hilarious and I have no girlfriend.
Hi, I'm Juliet and I'm a cop.
Nice rejection.
Very clean.
Have you seen Billy?
No.
He said 6:00 sharp, not a minute late.
And then he said let's twist this.
It's ten past.
Listen, if half of what Shawn has told me is true, none of you are being very smart.
Everyone needs to get inside together now.
Let's go.
Come on.
So you don't really know this Jason guy at all?
Any of you?
I can't believe I let him talk me into this.
Careful, Sissy.
You of all people should Forget that.
Enough is enough.
Jason wasn't completely honest with you guys.
He I can't imagine what you were about to say, Sissy.
Can't even imagine.
Who is she?
Detective O'Hara.
One of Santa Barbara's finest, both literally and figuratively.
Judas.
Pardon me?
No cops.
You gave me your word, Spencer.
You've ruined everything.
Look, Jason, we have blood soaked pajamas in the dryer and now Billy's missing, too.
I think it's safe to say that there is a clear and present danger here.
I'm finished.
I can't open the camp now.
Not now!
Listen, Jason, I am not the enemy here.
I think we all just need to stay together.
Nobody had to know.
I could have fixed this.
You've destroyed me, lago!
What does the parrot from Aladdin have to do with this?
He's not well.
We can't just let him go out there all by himself.
All right.
No, you stay here with us.
She's right.
You stay here with Sissy and Clive.
Gus and I will bring Jason back.
This is our case, he's our responsibility.
You must be out of your mind if you think for one second I'm going out there.
I've seen enough slasher movies to know that when a brother goes off to the woods, he doesn't even sort of come back.
Sorry.
LL Cool J made it all the way through Deep Blue Sea.
That was in the water, Shawn, with sharks and Sam Jackson's ass still got swallowed whole.
Fine.
I'll go alone.
I don't like this, Shawn.
Well, your hands are a little bit tied, aren't they?
Plus when you showed up, I was hiding in a closet.
So I figure I'm due to man up.
If I'm not back in exactly four minutes, please go looking for me.
But really start giving it some serious thought after two.
And if you think that there's anything even slightly amiss after 45 seconds, you're the leader here.
I told you we never should have come back to this place.
Jason!
Dude, we took a vote!
Staying in the house, not wandering around the woods won!
Pretty much unanimous.
Oh, man, we can totally do laundry in the morning!
Annie?
Are you okay?
Are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Drop it or I will shoot you where you stand!
No, don't shoot!
I have the shot!
Don't shoot!
Shawn, what are you doing?
This isn't Friday the 13th.
It's April Fool's Day.
Same formula, but with a killer twist ending.
You almost had me.
Your humble servant, my lord.
Bravo.
Wow.
Mr. Cunningham.
Bravo.
You did it, Shawn.
You really are something special.
What the Detective, please forgive me.
You so were not supposed to be here.
Somebody tell me what's going on right now.
In a nutshell, Jason's reopening Camp Tikihama all right.
But it's not for the kiddies.
I mean take a look around, he didn't even refill the swimming pool.
No, he's got something much darker in mind.
A murder camp.
It's like those mystery train things, but way, way cooler.
Every other week, eight people pay to have the bejesus scared out of them and solve a once-in-a-lifetime, whodunit murder mystery.
I needed a rehearsal.
And you two were in on this?
Only the set up, the dry run Jason started caught me by surprise, scared me senseless.
But, whoa, what a rush.
We all knew about the camp, but we had no idea that we were going to be his little guinea pigs this week.
It was so weird.
I could sense that there had been a struggle in the kitchen.
It's me.
It's me.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Left quite a mess, but somebody covered it up.
That's amazing.
How did you know it wasn't real?
Well, I'm a psychic, Jason.
There's no reliable defense for that.
I could feel that nothing was what it seemed.
But I couldn't have done it without Gus.
You were right, partner.
That wasn't paint on Annie's clothes.
Paint dries so does blood.
But corn syrup mixed with red dye number three, not so much.
That's how we do it.
Yin and yang.
I'm the spark that starts the fire.
Of course that probably wouldn't have occurred to me if you hadn't wiped it all over your pants, buddy.
You see my best friend can't stand the sight of blood.
He's even fainted on occasion.
That's not true.
What?
I don't believe you!
You were in on all of this?
Well, Jason called me a week ago and I figured this was the perfect chance to get Shawn back for an entire lifetime of scaring the daylights out of me.
Killer B. What!
So history repeats itself.
You two are my least favorite tag team of all time.
Really?
With Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff on the table?
Wow.
You just made that reference.
Well, I'll tell you what, let me start the apology train.
There is champagne on ice inside, maybe strawberries.
Yes!
We should go inside.
On three.
One, two, three.
Thank you very much, sir.
Come on, Jules, try to have some fun.
We're not being chased around by an ax-wielding maniac anymore.
It's kind of a sick little charade and been a colossal waste of my time, but since it's not a crime to be distasteful, maybe I can hang out until the storm passes.
I think I saw some Choco-diles in the fridge.
Tempting.
I shall return.
Crazy old man, what have you done to yourself?
If you're trying to make it up to the mountains this weekend, good luck.
Highway 17 has been completely blocked by an overturned logging truck.
Perfect, the wind probably brought down the only tower we had in the area.
I'll radio for an ambulance.
Don't bother.
They won't be coming and we won't be going.
Not tonight.
The road is completely blocked.
Of course it is.
A confidante told me, not too brazen, that I should proceed with caution.
And then I realized that's exactly my problem.
I never took any chances.
I didn't seize the moment.
I never let my emotions carry me.
I analyzed it all to death.
Protecting myself or protecting something, I don't even know what it is, but that's why we're here in this place.
I want to restart.
I want a second chance at a first impression, so here is something from the guy with nothing to protect.
Heart's on his sleeve, hat in hand.
Oh, God.
Don't say anything.
Just put it on.
It is long overdue.
No, this is It's just too much.
Oh, I've been working some overtime lately and sold some confiscated knives on Craigslist.
Of course that stimulus check, that certainly helped.
There's been a big mistake.
What?
Did I do something?
No, it's me.
I think I think that I was not very clear about my intentions when I said that I needed to meet with you.
What is this?
It's our divorce papers.
Nobody is to touch that body.
I can justify moving it because of the storm, but until further notice, that porch is off limits.
Do we know what happened to him?
It's impossible to tell before an autopsy.
But there are no clear signs of foul play that I can see.
He certainly didn't strike me as much of a swimmer.
His trailer doesn't have any running water.
I think he bathes in the lake.
Still nothing.
I want to know the second any of you can use your phones.
I guess this kills the game of strip cribbage that I was trying to start.
No, let's do it.
Anything to get my mind off this day.
Come on, Gus.
Jason, you're playing, too.
Whatever you say, my dear.
Come on, Clive, you know you want some of this action.
No, thanks.
I got weird nipples, though it does seem appropriate to play a game with a dead guy on the porch, I got a date in the den with the moon patrol.
What about you, Annie?
Are you in?
Um, no.
I want the rest of this muck off my neck and I want a hot shower.
Annie, where do you think you're going?
Away from the animals.
Don't worry, you don't need to baby sit me, okay?
I'll just be in my cabin regretting the decision to take this job in the first place.
Jules, may I have a word, please?
Something still feels off.
I'm getting some pretty strong vibes that Erwen didn't have the big one while he was exfoliating his armpits.
Can't you do better than vibes?
Jeff Goldblum and Cyndi Lauper couldn't.
How about you let me have an honest look at that body?
All right.
He's a little nicked up, but the current carried him pretty far, so it could be anything.
No touching, Shawn.
Didn't need to be said.
Anything?
It's not clear.
Not yet.
Strip cribbage, my ass.
God!
Jason, you jerk.
That's not funny at all.
Get out of here.
Jason?
What is that now, four in a row?
This is nuts.
You still have on your shoes and socks.
Do you even know how this game works?
Oh!
Wow.
Boy, Billy, I will give you everything in Gus's wallet if you put your pants back on.
Dude, please cover your junk.
Probably just a breaker.
Back in a flash.
You guys aren't afraid of the dark, are you?
Thank you.
Carlton.
Let's not.
You know this has been coming for a long time.
Honestly, let's just skip this part.
Signed them while you were in the bathroom.
Really?
Two years ago you would have thrown them in the fire.
No.
Two years ago I would have lit them on fire and put them back in your purse.
I don't think this place likes me very much.
I don't think I'll ever stop loving you, not completely.
Say something.
When you first left me, I may have had you followed and cloned your cell phone, but it doesn't matter.
It's not about the past anymore, it's about tomorrow.
So I'm not going to say a word.
You know that I want to.
I want to scream to the sky that I would do anything to get you back, but I'm going to let you go because that's what you want.
Once you walk out that door, I'm going to let go of everything I've been holding onto so we can both have tomorrow.
Bye, Victoria.
Bye, Carlton.
Stupid breaker.
Jason.
You scared the crap out of me.
Dude.
Finally.
Shawn?
I stumbled upon Erwen's living quarters and I mean that loosely.
Clive?
Shawn, what's going on?
I think we have a very serious problem.
What the hell is this?
What the Clive killed Erwen.
I don't know why, but he did.
And now he's out there.
And so are Billy and Annie.
Listen to me very carefully, I want you all to stay together in the living room.
Don't open the door for anybody but me.
I'm coming, too!
No.
We can cover more ground this way.
Shawn.
We're not discussing this.
There's not time.
Shawn.
Buddy, it'll be okay.
I'm going to be right back.
You hold down the fort.
This is a disaster.
I hire a psychopath to work at my murder camp.
What are the odds?
Let's just keep it together.
Nobody's getting in here.
We're going to be okay.
What was that?
What was what?
Jason!
Clive!
Jason!
Get her out of here!
No!
Get her out of here!
Get out!
Annie!
Annie!
Billy!
What are you doing out here?
He was in I don't understand.
He was in the house!
Oh, my God, Gus!
Stay here!
Gus!
You're okay!
You're okay!
You're okay!
You're okay!
You're okay!
You're okay!
Uh-oh!
Clive, you don't want to do this!
Gus!
Oh, but I do!
I'm quite sure of it.
You see the man that died here Of course he was.
And you guys think it's funny?
It's fun?
You want to re-enact it for a game?
Well, I can play, too!
Shawn, what are you doing here?
I came in here to save you!
I beat him already!
Well, I can see that now!
Here, take this!
This is a pool skimmer.
There's not a lot of options here, Shawn!
Juliet!
Clive, I was a victim here, too.
You're one of them!
And now you're going to die!
I don't even like Jason.
My piñata was a lot better than his!
What are you even talking about?
I don't know.
I was trying to make a point.
Things got personal.
Gus!
What are you doing?
I'm causing a diversion!
You're all the same!
You want murder and mayhem!
Well, you got it.
This is my game.
And guess who's going to lose.
Gus, get back!
Jules, a little help here!
I don't have a shot, Shawn!
Take the shot!
I don't have it!
Get it!
Shoot that mother In the hand?
Are you kidding me?
Don't move.
You're going to be okay, Jason.
I'm so sorry.
I never meant for anybody We know you didn't.
Neither did I. Just Time will heal.
You'll see.
Just get yourself right.
I'm going with him.
Why don't you stay here with us?
I really should go.
After all, he is my fiancé.
What?
I'm right here with you, honey.
You're going to be okay.
I just wanted to say thank you for shooting that whack job, psycho killer in the hand.
My pleasure.
And I know this probably sounds weird, but even though I was really scared and discombobulated and whatnot, that level of pinpoint marksmanship from you is easily one of the sexiest things that I've ever Shawn.
Okay.
How could something so ugly happen here?
Just doesn't make any sense.
Last looks, Gus, it'll be a cold day in hell before we ever I'm sorry I ditched you and made a piñata with Jason Cunningham.
Apology accepted.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
{END OF EPISODE 15}{START OF EPISODE 16}
Hey, can I get you guys anything else before I close this check out?
As a matter of fact, you can.
My partner, Trapezius Milkington, would like to see something in a Belgian waffle.
Shawn, it's 12:30.
I do not want waffles or eggs or Malt-O-Meal.
All right.
What would you recommend?
Oh, my gosh!
If you're going to do this, I'm going to the bathroom.
Excuse me.
Don't mind him.
His bladder's probably smaller than yours.
Now go ahead, and take my taste buds on a fantastical journey.
I don't know I like the burgers.
Ah, ah, ah.
I'm sorry, I should have told you.
Only rule, it can't be something that someone would order for lunch.
Keep in mind, we want to go off script here.
Okay, I see.
Well, in that case I would recommend the pumpkin pancakes with a side of lingcod.
Does that work?
Let's get married.
You don't even know me!
Oh, really!
Allow me to introduce yourself.
Jetta girl, maybe green.
Backseat loaded with empty Pinkberry cups.
Oh, my God!
Wrong!
I drive a Jeep.
A black Jeep.
But you're dead-on with the Pinkberry.
So what do you think?
Should we set a date or what?
Mmm, I'll think about it.
Fair enough.
Mmm-hmm.
Let me guess.
She's considering your proposal of marriage?
How could you possibly know that?
Shawn, you use that same tired-ass routine on every other waitress that serves us.
This is categorically untrue.
You used it on that 80-year-old fixings attendant at Fuddruckers.
What's your point, man?
My point is, you're going to be 80 years old and still shamelessly hitting on waitresses.
Is that what you want?
Is that a trick question?
What do you think?
All right, Hitch, you want me to take a chance?
Huh?
You want to see some Will Hunting action?
Here we go.
Who are you calling?
Juliet?
That routine is as tired as the waitress bit.
Wait for it.
Wait for it.
Hello?
Abigail Lytar?
Judd Nelson.
Shawn, stop playing.
Is that really Abigail?
Shawn, is that you?
Of course it is.
Don't be ridiculous.
Look, clearly, we left some loose ends at our high school reunion, so I was thinking that maybe we should get together.
Why on earth would you think that's a good idea?
Oh, I don't know, the last time I saw you, we kissed for like 27 seconds?
Can I tell you something?
Gord.
So just us, sitting at the same table?
Hopefully a corner booth.
Abigail, what's happening here is, I'm asking you out on a proper date.
Shawn, are you sure?
Are you sure about this?
Yes, I believe I am.
Pick you up at 7:00.
I'll be the one flaring my nostrils uncontrollably.
Oh, God, no.
Done.
How do you like them apples?
I sincerely hope you didn't just do that to prove a point.
She's a real person, Shawn.
That's no joke.
She misses me already.
Oh.
Chief!
Get down here now.
I'm not asking.
That's weird.
We received the following letter about an hour ago.
It has been authenticated.
It's from the Yin-Yang killer.
Pay close attention.
"Hey, everybody, I'm back, for one night only.
"I'm going to kill someone tonight.
"Guess who?
Guess where?
Guess how?
"This is going to be so much fun.
"Signed, Mr. Yang.
" He's looking for a new challenger.
That's what he does.
Chief, I believe he's speaking to me.
Trust me, I'm ready.
Well, come on people.
He could be talking about anybody.
Look, just last week, Officer Jankowicz guessed my favorite variety of snack cracker.
Tuscan wheat, it's really obscure.
I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end What do we have on his description?
We don't.
We've never had any age, ethnicity or physical description.
The harsh truth is that this is his game.
And we just have to play along with him.
That's a terrific plan.
Especially since it's worked out so well in the past.
Chief, the Mayor's on the phone.
Oh, here we go.
Detective Lassiter, introduce Shawn to our point person.
Spencer, listen up.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Getting I'm getting something already.
What?
What is it?
I can see the killer.
Already?
Yes.
And I know exactly where he is.
Right there.
Come on, that's our guy.
Shawn.
Shawn, that is Mary Lightly, our profiler from the Serial Homicide and Abduction Task Force.
He is very familiar with the patterns of our killer.
And how to make an attractive lamp out of human skin.
Shawn, play nice.
He's a genius, and we need him.
Mary, this is Shawn Spencer, in the flesh.
See?
He said "flesh.
" You know him?
I've done my research, okay?
Yeah, well, I've Googled myself, too, and there's a lot of stuff missing.
This is my partner, Sterling Cooper.
Hello.
So what's "Mary" short for?
Marion?
No.
Great, we're all good friends.
Care to shed a little light on this subject?
Mr. Yang is the most notorious killer this city has never seen.
He claimed six victims in the summer of 1995, and has resurfaced twice, claiming a single victim in each instance.
He only resurfaces when he feels there's a worthy opponent.
Now, his M.O. Is to challenge us with the opportunity to save the victims by solving his riddles.
Question, regarding the whole Mary thing.
My father's name was Mary.
His father before him was named Mary, and his father before him was named Craig.
Fair enough.
Proceed.
Yin-Yang.
The origin of this Chinese symbol is the unity of opposites.
Two opposing, and at the same time, complimentary aspects.
Dark versus light.
Killer versus cop.
Kramer versus Kramer.
Just show him the riddle.
"She serves the General well today "whose soldiers wait to die.
"In a white river they shall pay "for them she will not cry.
Who is she"?
Now, this riddle came with this stopwatch already running.
One of his classic moves.
We've got one hour and ten minutes, people.
Generals and soldiers.
She'd be in the military.
McNab!
Yes, sir!
Damn it.
I want you to contact every military base in an 80-mile radius.
Find out if any female personnel have gone AWOL in the last 48 hours.
And bear in mind, it's the psychic that he wants to play with.
Each riddle will relate to him, personally.
Do you have any thoughts, Shawn?
Yes, Jules, I do.
First of all, his rhyming skills are rudimentary at best.
"Today" and "pay"?
"Die" and "cry"?
Come on.
That's bush league.
It's bush, Lassy!
Spencer, stop screwing around.
Get on with it.
I understand.
Yes.
Thank you, sir.
Karen, you're not going to use my son as a pawn.
Oh, I'll advise you to proceed with caution.
Need I remind you what happened to the last detective who went head-to-head with this sick bastard?
He lost, and an innocent girl died.
Now, I will thank you to go home and let us do our work!
Not going to happen.
Not going to happen!
Henry!
Your son is the only shot that we have.
Period.
Yeah, well, not my problem.
Thus far Shawn!
Excuse me.
Hey, did I miss a memo?
I thought Bring Your Daddy to Work Day was next week.
I forbid you to be a part of this, Shawn.
You're coming with me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Forbid me?
I'm familiar with your hands-on approach to parenting, but I'm not 27 anymore.
I can do whatever I want.
This guy knows about you, he knows about everybody you care about.
Think about that.
You don't catch this son of a bitch, kid, you're never going to sleep again.
Spencer, 55 minutes.
Go home, Dad.
I've got this.
Go home.
Sorry, guys.
My dad was just dropping off my Zodiac DVD.
Can we focus, please?
"In a white river they shall pay.
" His seventh victim washed up on shore.
Maybe there's a No!
There's never a repeat performance.
Okay?
Each victim is a new masterpiece, and the first riddle is always a gimme.
This guy is itching to play the game.
Think about the last 24 hours.
Gus!
Gus, I got it.
I mean, I know who the General is.
His name is Mills.
General Mills, the cereal manufacturer?
Exactly!
The white river is milk, and the soldiers are cereal.
So who is she?
Hi, welcome to Captain Ron's.
Table for five?
There was a waitress here earlier, long brown hair.
I haven't seen her in a while.
She must be on break.
Where?
In the back, by the lockers.
How do you know this girl?
We don't really know her.
She served us our lunch.
"Oh, rats, Shawn, so close.
Too bad she has to die.
"But how?
And when?
And where?
Don't bother asking why.
" Well, he still owes us a riddle.
This is just the amuse-bouche.
He's taunting you.
I believe he's using the Alpha-Bits to send a message, that he, too, believes that breakfast for lunch is way underrated.
Would anyone like to try writing this message with a burrito?
Open challenge.
Take a shot.
Exactly.
I rest my case.
And now I want a burrito.
Can I talk to you for a second, please?
Dude, what are you doing?
What are you talking about?
A girl's life is at stake and you're acting like an ass?
Making jokes?
You haven't taken this thing seriously from jump street.
Exactly.
Exactly?
Gus, I have to work like this, okay?
That guy gets in my head, we lose.
I have to do my thing.
I cannot show weakness.
And my fanciful rhetoric helps defuse a situation that's very tense for the group.
But Shawn, nobody is laughing.
Trust me.
They're laughing on the inside.
That's how it works, buddy.
And I need you to help me out here.
Do you think you can do that?
I'll try.
All right.
"Little League is over.
You just became a pro.
"Score a run, we'll have more fun.
"Make sure you beat the throw.
" Next location.
How much time do we have?
Seventeen minutes.
Wow.
I want pancakes.
Who wants some pancakes?
Whipped butter.
Maple syrup.
What?
"Make sure you beat the throw" insinuates a close play.
You gotta touch home plate.
You gotta touch home plate to score a run.
That means the clue is back at the police station.
Hmm.
Mmm-hmm.
Make a hole!
Mom?
Hey, goose.
Hi, Mrs. Spencer.
Hey.
Spencer!
Let's go!
We need to talk.
I'll make it quick.
Sure, no problem.
Find the clue.
I'll be right there!
Bye.
Bye I'm not going to mince words.
Your father called me, he's worried about you.
He wants me to convince you not to do this.
So he calls you, you hop on a plane.
That's how it works, huh?
No, Shawn, I didn't fly down here.
I was at a conference in Ventura.
You were in town?
Would've been nice to know.
Truth is, I'm worried about you, too.
I did psych evals of several officers who were involved in this first round of this maniac's game.
It wasn't pretty.
All right, look, first of all, Mom, I have a date tonight.
All right?
So I have to wrap this up at a reasonable hour.
And secondly, this guy has never gone up against me.
If I can stand here, and tell you that I will nail this guy, are you really going to tell me to walk away?
Shawn!
Mom!
I can beat him.
I will beat him.
Okay, goose.
Nail the son of a bitch.
Yeah.
Okay, I've got to go, Mom.
Please be right.
Spencer!
Conference room.
Thanks.
Well, someone must have signed for this.
It wasn't delivered.
Dobson found it outside the file room.
Well, how in the hell can Okay, you know what, people?
Eyes open!
Chief?
Lou Sardocki from the Independent is on the phone.
He says you owe him a statement?
Oh, I'll give him a statement.
That's pretty clever.
"Meet my little buddy Ben.
" "Pitter patter is your hint.
If you can't remember when, just read the fine print.
" And we have less than one hour.
Shawn, can you speak to it?
No, he can't speak to it!
Yes, he can.
Just give him some room.
Back up.
Fine, knock yourself out, Doctor Dolittle.
"Doctor Dolittle"?
I know you can do better than that, Lassy.
I know you can.
I don't I don't know what I'm supposed to remember.
Hey, everybody.
Guess who I am?
Hee, hee I'm Michael Jackson.
King of pop.
Shawn, I don't think this is working.
Are you kidding me?
That was a home run.
Keep up the good work.
"Pitter patter" is the hint.
Now, I don't think we're speaking to a mouse.
I think the mouse is speaking to you.
What do you got, Shawn?
"Fine print.
" Hello, my friend.
It's the fine print.
He was walking on it.
Dude, this is crazy!
"Adam Hornstock selling black snake.
Will go fast.
" "Mira Gaffney seeks Bruton Gaster to love her tender.
" All people from past cases.
How do you know that?
I told you, I did my research.
And finding Bouchard's treasure was extremely impressive.
Thank you, Willard.
My pleasure.
"Snarky psychic seeks ferroequinologist to help with killer smile.
" He's calling me snarky?
"Ferroequinologist"?
A ferroequinologist is a train enthusiast.
How do you know that?
Because I am a ferroequinologist.
I too, am a ferroequinologist.
"Love her tender.
" The tender is a small fuel car right behind the locomotive.
And "black snake" is slang for coal train.
There's only one coal train that runs through Santa Barbara.
Thank God.
The train's right on time.
That is outstanding.
It's not going to stop.
What?
It's not going to stop.
This is just a pull-through station.
What the hell are we doing here?
Come on!
What the Where the hell are you going?
Come on, Gus.
This is our fantasy, man!
It's like we're hobos.
I don't have a hobo fantasy, Shawn.
Abigail, you called me back!
Yes, you left me very specific instructions in your message to do so.
Is this a bad time?
No, I can talk!
Look, we're still totally on for tonight.
I might just have to push the time a little bit.
Uh-huh.
Let me guess, you're chasing a serial killer or something.
Holy crap, yes!
Yes, that's exactly what I'm doing!
How did I cannot believe that you are bailing on me again!
Hold on!
Tell Abigail what we're doing!
Hello, Abigail!
It's Gus!
We're chasing a train like hobos!
What?
She wants to talk with you.
First of all, his out-of-breath voice is terrible.
He was bad in Othello senior year, he's bad now.
Look, I'm just flashing back to high school, and I have this image of me standing alone on a pier looking like an idiot.
Look, I swear I'm telling the truth!
I'm going to have to call you back!
By the way, you were beautiful on that pier!
Ah!
"A moving picture is worth a thousand words, "so read the story and follow the birds.
"P.S. Once you're there you'll hear a phone.
"You have eight rings to pick up, "or the girl is dead.
"Shame on me, that didn't even rhyme.
" We have 27 minutes to solve this.
Okay.
Here.
This is, uh Okay What do you see?
Nothing.
I don't see anything.
Not yet.
Oh, wait, I do see something.
What?
What is it?
I think you're going to want to see this.
It's pretty good.
Let me on.
Mary, I'm surprised it took you so long.
You seemed to spry.
Ankle weights.
I always wear them.
Even when I sleep.
I read about it in Men's Fitness.
Totally reinvigorated Ryan Reynolds' career.
So what's the riddle?
How can I help?
"A moving A moving picture.
"A moving picture is worth a thousand words.
" You've got to be kidding me.
You've got to be kidding me!
I got it!
I solved it!
Let's go!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
"Follow the birds.
" There.
That's five rings, Shawn!
Answer it!
Shawn, what are you doing?
No, don't you see?
It didn't start ringing until we were three feet away.
Answer the phone, Spencer!
He's watching us right now from somewhere!
Answer the phone, Shawn!
If that girl dies, you're an accessory to murder.
Shawn, I hope to God you know what you're doing.
Unbelievable.
He's been here.
He was here watching us the whole time!
Don't touch anything.
Let's get CSI down here to dust for prints.
There's no need.
I'm sure he touched things.
He probably touched everything, but you're not going to find any prints.
He's too good for that.
What is this sick, twisted admiration you have for this whack job?
Now do you get how good he is?
This puppy's just warming up.
Hey everybody, check it out.
Look how big I am compared to this plane.
I'm King Kong.
Guster, what the hell is going on with you?
Seriously, man, I need you to pull yourself together.
Oh, my God.
Let me see that.
I got it!
It's a message.
He says, "You are a naughty, naughty boy.
" He's giving us another chance.
She's still alive.
Let's go back to the station, wait for instructions.
Forget that.
I'm I'm not going.
What do you mean?
I'm nobody's puppet, okay?
I'm done.
I'm done playing his little game.
I solved his puzzles.
I talked to a rat.
I even chased a train.
I'm finished.
No one's ever gotten this far.
That's why he's still playing.
It's a sign of respect.
No.
It isn't, Mary.
You said it, man, with your fey name and your weird Ken Burns haircut.
He's too good!
Isn't that right?
He's better than me!
We never had a chance!
He's going to kill that girl either way!
Maybe, maybe not, Shawn, but I know this, you don't just give up.
Tell you what, Jules, uh, the next time a serial killer calls you out, personally, you can pick up your little pompoms and you can rally the troops and never say die.
I'm out.
Now, get out.
All three of you.
I can't believe I'm hearing this.
Should I say it again?
You know what?
Screw you, Spencer.
We don't need you!
We don't need him, O'Hara.
We will find this sicko on our own.
Come on!
We're running out of time.
Look, Shawn, I know you're upset, but if we give up now Gus, don't be The Last of the Famous International Playboys.
We're not giving up, okay?
Far from it.
The only chance we have to win the game at this point is to change the rules, okay?
I took a risk out there because I knew he wouldn't kill her.
I knew he wouldn't kill her because he loves the game too much, but that bought us time.
It bought us time to work by ourselves.
Okay?
We're going to We're going to drop off his radar.
We're still going to find the girl.
We're going to do it on our own.
That's our move.
All right, but where do we start?
We go back to the beginning.
Back to the beginning, and we trace the steps of Mr. Yang.
All right.
You like what I did with the King Kong?
You're on fire.
You're even using props.
Just got this fax.
Traced it to a bogus 800 number.
"I'm no Doubting Thomas.
I pucker up to fights.
"Were you to shake my hand, you'd have to use your right.
Who am I"?
Well, if Yang was watching, he couldn't know if Spencer flew the coop.
This could be directed at any one of us.
Probably not this guy.
It's me.
It's directed at me.
He must know I'm a Civil War buff.
Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson was shot and killed by his own troops at the Battle of Chancellorsville.
He was known for sucking on lemons, even during combat.
And while he is buried in Lexington, Virginia, his left arm is buried separately near the battlefield.
Hey, you guys remember that Pat Swayze miniseries, North and South?
Talk about Civil War buff, huh?
Oh, my God!
The Stonewall Hotel and Suites!
Probably room 1863!
We've got to get down there.
And you can count me in for next year's reenactment, partner.
Copy that.
Get my jacket.
Look, call me back, okay?
We're still on for tonight.
Gus and I are making some serious progress here.
Call me back!
Straight to voicemail.
That's not a good sign.
Wrong!
I drive a Jeep.
A black Jeep.
Gus, there's no Jeep.
I think he drove away in her car.
We find the car, we may find the girl.
Lassiter, hold on.
Find the girl's car.
It's a black Jeep.
We already did.
You got to get down here.
Where are you?
SBPD!
Room's clear!
Clear!
She's breathing.
I'll get the paramedics.
What is this?
"Shawn no longer wants to play.
"Stakes too low to make you stay"?
He's He's got her, Gus.
He's got my mom.
Okay, I sent a couple of officers over to Abigail Lytar's apartment, and she's fine.
But I'm posting them on a watch until we can figure out what is going on.
Spencer, you need to get in here.
"You should be moving, as most people do, "but instead you sit and enjoy the view.
"P.S. Mommy says, 'Hi' and 'Bye'.
Just in case.
" "VU".
Why did he spell it that way?
Maybe that's the hint.
Or maybe he ran out of lipstick.
Brendan Vu.
From the spelling bee.
Good guess, but it's a misdirect.
I know exactly what he wants me to watch.
You do?
This is like a needle in a haystack made completely out of needles.
Looks like we're at the end game.
All right, we know he used the waitress's car, so there's a good chance It's definitely a chance.
What kind of car does your wife drive?
She rents when she's down here.
Do you know what company she rents from?
That could narrow it down to a few models.
It's blue.
It's blue, Gus.
We're looking for a blue car.
It's a sedan.
People, we're looking for a blue car!
A sedan!
Go, go, go!
All right, split up.
Squad, cover the exits!
West side!
West side!
Roger that.
Hey, man!
Watch where you're going!
Hey!
Get off!
Get off the car!
Get off my car, man!
Hey, Ma.
Shawn!
Shawn!
Shh, shh!
Dad, get down, get down.
Oh, jeez.
Mom.
I'm going to take this off, okay?
Mmm.
It's okay.
It's just a decoy.
I know.
I see that.
He's fine.
He's breathing.
Yang must have knocked him out.
SWAT, call for a medic!
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, my God.
Dad, she's strapped.
Oh, God, no.
Mom, where is he?
Maddie.
Henry?
Yeah, it's me, sweetheart.
I'm right here.
I'm not going anywhere.
All right, then I won't, either.
Besides, I don't really have anything better to do right now.
It's just a pen.
It's just a pen!
What does this mean, Mary?
Tell us!
I don't know.
This feels more like improvisation.
This isn't his game.
We got here in time.
Maybe we won.
No, he's definitely going to kill her dead.
I just don't know how.
He's been one step ahead this whole time.
Where's Shawn?
Hopefully one step ahead of us.
Okay.
All right, be honest with me.
You're surprised, right?
I'm prettier than you thought I'd be.
It's the bone structure.
I won.
I beat you.
That was the deal.
Let my mom go.
You are just amazing.
Just my most, most admirable foe.
But then, see, I knew you would be.
That's why I chose you.
Because I'm I'm your yin.
Well, that's sweet.
Thank you for that.
But you're completely surrounded.
There's no way out of this for you.
Hey, you know what I love about this movie, Shawn?
Its great resolution.
Okay, so call me old-fashioned, but really, is there anything more satisfying than a solid ending?
You call me a killer, but the truth is, I complete things.
And that is what people really want, to feel complete.
That, and a corner booth.
And now, our story, that we created so beautifully together, is going to end.
But how?
Do you want to know what it is?
Or do you want to be surprised?
Let's dial up!
Move in slow.
Stand down!
Stand down!
Stand down.
Stand down.
Move them back.
Let's go!
Let me guess.
You want to die, right?
That's the perfect resolution?
Gee, that's original.
You're a cliché.
You're a knockoff of a knockoff.
I could have killed your mom hours ago, Shawn.
This switch has such a light touch, like pinching a baby's cheek.
And then, boom!
She blows up.
How much fun would that be to see?
Oh, it gives me shivers, I want to do that so badly!
But then, you wouldn't like me, Shawn.
And I want you to like me.
Oh, God, I'm so torn.
I need you to like me, because we're going to be working together again.
Oh, no, no, no, no.
You're going to rot in a cell with four padded walls.
The end.
No.
The end of the beginning.
I'm going to write a book.
Our story.
It's going to be epic.
A bestseller.
And guess what?
I want you to write the forward.
Pass.
Okay.
But think about it on your date tonight.
Clear!
Take the subject!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Let's go.
Okay.
All right, you're okay.
You're okay.
All right.
Think about it on your date tonight.
She was there.
Gus, she was there the whole time.
You got her, Shawn.
End of story.
Congratulations, Spencer.
Don't be too excited there, Mary.
It's not like we just apprehended Santa Barbara's most notorious killer or anything.
You're right, Gus.
I'm sorry to fly off the handle.
I've spent the last 13 years of my life with this person.
I have to find a new hobby.
Two words.
Racquetball.
That could work.
Thanks for your help, man.
I needed it.
Gus, you play racquetball?
Goodbye, Mary.
Until next time.
Okay.
Okay.
There we go.
Better?
Henry, I told him to go for it.
That doesn't matter.
What matters is that you're both okay.
You two are the most important people in the world to me, you know.
I do know.
Mom!
Let's get you out of here.
What do you need?
What can I do?
Let's see.
You already got me kidnapped by a raging sociopath Right.
Check.
What else?
Nothing!
Nothing, goose.
I'm really fine.
Your father's been taking very good care of me.
Well, be good.
Yep.
If I'm not mistaken, you have a very important date tonight.
Oh, Mom, please, I can reschedule.
No, you won't!
I'm fine!
The crazy bitch snuck up from behind me with chloroform.
Life is more than catching bad guys.
You did a good deed today.
Now it's time to go see about a girl.
It's time to go see about a How you like them apples?
Well played, Mom.
All right.
Hey.
Shawn, did you really just catch Mr. Yang?
Yes, I did.
And he turned out to be a she.
Curious.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm sorry I didn't believe you earlier.
I just, uh, really didn't.
Half-apology accepted.
Uh, I cut a deal with the theater manager, so this is still happening in a big, big way.
How do you feel about popped corn?
I like it.
I like it very much.
Jules!
What are you doing here?
What I mean is, you know, who's going to fit Mr. Yang with her straightjacket and iron mask with face grill?
Something tells me there's an entire precinct of officers bidding on that job right now.
Uh, can I interest you in a Necco Wafer?
Shawn, can you just not talk for a few seconds?
Look, I just wanted to tell you that what you did today I mean, I can't imagine being able to function at that level while your mom was You know.
I am, uh, clearly not as good with words as you are, and I know that things between us have been a little complicated, and that there have probably been some mixed signals, mostly from me, with regards to the time that we spend together outside of the line of duty.
Look, Jules Shh!
Please, just let me finish stumbling through this.
I'm almost done.
I promise.
What I'm saying is that I think, maybe, the best things, the richest things, aren't supposed to come easily, and that sometimes the moments that make the most sense happen when everything else doesn't, and, well, I think you deserve more than popcorn tonight.
So why don't you let me take you to dinner?
Detective O'Hara, are you asking me out on a date?
I am.
A proper one.
Wow.
I cannot believe this.
All this time, and Your timing is just awful.
It is?
Yeah, just dreadful.
What?
I can't go to dinner with you, Jules.
I'm already on a date.
You are?
What, here?
Yeah.
Right now.
It's It's weird, it's a little weird, but, uh Yeah.
With Abigail.
The one that got away.
Yeah.
Get out there.
She's not going to wait forever.
Jules?
I am so sorry for snapping at you earlier.
I know.
You all right?
Yeah.
Why would you even ask that?
Mostly because you look like you got punched in the stomach and stopped breathing for a few seconds.
Wow.
I didn't realize I was that transparent.
The truth The truth is, Abigail, everything is not okay.
And I don't know exactly how to say this.
Try using words to form a sentence.
I'm so, so sorry, Abigail.
They're all out of butter.
Wait, what?
I know.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I'm apologizing, 'cause it's not my fault, really, but I mean, it's opening night, and how do you run out of butter?
That's cardinal.
That's cardinal.
What are we going to do?
I don't know exactly.
Uh, as you can see, the kernels are fluffy, and salted quite nicely.
I tried I tried one.
But we do have Necco Wafers.
Necco?
And Toblerone.
I love Toblerone.
Yes, I sensed that you might.
It's like a more sophisticated Krackle.
Yeah!
Hey, you're sure about this?
Absolutely.
Now, in with you into this carriage.
Okey-doke.
That's what I'm talking about.
Gus.
Hello, Abigail.
The thing is, it's his car.
It's a company car, and he's very protective of it.
So just pretend like he isn't here.
Are those Necco Wafers up there?
Yes, they are.
Pass them back please.
In between the lines there's a lot of obscurity I'm not inclined to resign to maturity If it's all right then you're all wrong But why bounce around to the same damn song?
You'd rather run when you can't crawl I know, you know That I'm not telling the truth I know, you know They just don't have any proof Embrace the deception Learn how to bend Your worst inhibitions tend to psych you out in the end I know, you know I know, you know
